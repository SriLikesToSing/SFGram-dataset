Science Fiction in Academe 



S hortly before this issue of If ap- 
pears we expect to visit the 
campus of Wooster College in Ohio 
to take part in the 1964 session of 
the Modern Language Association’s 
annual symposium on science fic- 
tion. 

This sort of event has become 
rather un-newsworthy of late. The 
University of Chicago, perhaps, led 
off the trend with its seminar on 
science fiction a few years ago. 
At U.C.L.A., a depository for sci- 
ence-fiction magazines has been 
established — not just the news- 
stand publications like If, Galaxy 
and Worlds of Tomorrow , but the 
mimeographed, hectographed and 
even carbon-copied “fanzines” pub- 
lished for limited circulation by sci- 
ence-fiction readers all over the 
world. Syracuse University is at- 
tempting to establish another sort 
of depository, collecting the papers 
of science-fiction writers as a per- 
manent record of their lives and 
thoughts. 

This growth of scholarly interest 
in science fiction is both pleasing 
and sobering — pleasing because we 
like science fiction, and like to have 
other people take an interest in it; 
sobering because it somehow has 
the aroma of erecting a monument. 
(An honor which is, of course, us- 
ually reserved for the dead.) 

N ow, we don’t think for one min- 
ute that science fiction is dead, 



or even showing signs of failing. 
We think it’s here to stay. 

We do think, though, that there 
has been some visible tendency foi 
science-fiction writers and editors to 
begin to take themselves a little 
over-seriously, as though conscious 
of the scholarly eyes upon them; 
and we have the uneasy notion that 
the sort of self-consciousness that 
feeling engenders could in the long 
run be serious. After all, science 
fiction’s greatest merit lies in its 
tolerance of the way-out and its 
freedom from convention! 

As we see it, it’s our job, especi- 
ally here in //, to stay loose. No 
formulas. No playing it safe. 

What we think we ought to be 
doing here in If is turning up all 
the new talent we can (as in our 
“firsts” — this month’s is J. L. 
Frye, with Zombie ), enticing back 
the greatest of the old masters (as 
with A. E. Van Vogt, herewith, and 
Doc Smith’s Skylark DaQuesne , 
coming up shortly) — and giving 
them all as much freedom as they 
need to keep us all alert . and 
entertained! 

We hope we’re succeeding in this. 
Judging by the letters we get for 
Hue and Cry (squeezed out of this 
issue, by the way — but back next 
month), most of you feel we are. 
But if you think not, or if you 
have an idea of how we can do 
things better — let’s hear from 
you! — THE EDITOR

THE 

REPLICATORS 

by A. E. VAN VOGT 

Illustrated by MORROW 



The aHen was mighty but it could be 
killed— again and again and againl 



1 

S tanding there, after killing the 
monster, Matlin began to get 

mad. 

In its death throes, the twelve- 
foot creature had done a violent 
muscular convulsion and somer- 
saulted over into the dump section 
of Matlin’s truck. 

There it lay now, with its ele- 



phantine head and quarter-length 
trunk twisted to one side, and a 
huge arm and hand flung up and 
visible over the rear end. What 
must have been tons of shiny, black 
body was squashed limply down in- 
to the bottom of the cavernous 
metal carrier . creating a prob- 
lem. 

That was all it was to Matlin: 
a problem. 



6 





Steve Matlin was an abysmally 
suspicious and angry man. His im- 
pulse now was to dump the beast 
in the weeds beside the road. Re- 
luctantly, he decided against that. 
He had unfortunately been seen 
driving along this little used lake 
road by the two officers of a high- 
way patrol car. If the patrolmen 
found the creature’s body, they 
would assume that he had shot it. 

This benighted man, Matlin, en- 
visioned himself as being the person 
who would have to see to the dis- 
position of the dead monster. As he 
reasoned it out, if he made the 
mistake of dumping it in the wrong 
place, he’d have to hire a crane to 
get it into his truck again. And if he 
simply look it home, he’d have the 
job of digging a hole for it. 

“Better take it to the police,” 
he decided gloomily, “and follow 
their advice like a good little fel- 
low.” 

Seething at the nuisance, but re- 
signed, he drove to the main high- 
way. There, instead of turning left 
to his farm, he headed for Minden, 
the nearest suburb of the city. Ar- 
rived in town, he drove straight to 
the police station, braked to a halt, 
and vigorously honked his horn. 

Nobody showed. 

The exasperated Matlin was about 
to lean on his horn and really blast 
them with sound, when he made an 
electrifying discovery. The police 
headquarters was on a side street 
and, whatever the reason, there 
wasn’t a car or person in sight. 

. Hot afternoon, empty street, 
rare opportunity — 

Matlin tripped the lever that 



started the dump mechanism. A mo- 
ment later, he felt the beasi s oody 
shift. He simply drove out irorn un- 
der it and kept on going, gunning 
his motor and reversing me uump 
mechanism. 

II 

T hat night before they went t* 
bed, his wife, Cora, said to 
him, “Did you hear about the crea- 
ture from space?” 

Matlin’s mind leaped to the mem- 
ory of the beast he had carted 
into town. He thought scathingly: 
“Those nuts! Creature from space 
indeed!” But he said aloud, gruffly, 
“You watching that junk on TV?” 
“It was in the news report,” she 
said defensively. “They found it 
right there in the street.” 

So it was the thing he had killed. 
He felt a sudden glee. He’d got away 
with it. He thought smugly: “Saved 
myself twenty-five bucks. Time I 
had a little luck.” 

He went silently to bed. 

Cora lay for a while, listening 
to his peaceful breathing, thinking of 
the monster from space — and 
thinking of the universe that she 
knew existed somewhere beyond the 
narrow world of Steve Matlin. She 
had once been a teacher. But that 
was four children and two decades 
ago. It was a little hard sometimes 
to realize how far away the real 
world was these days. 

Out there, a creature never be- 
fore seen on earth had been found 
lying dead in the street in front of 
the Minden police station. The TV 
cameras brought front views, side

there, breathless. 

What he had expected, in coming 
here by himself, Matlin had never 
considered clearly. When Cora had 
told him of the reward money, he 
had instantly derided her trusting 
nature. 

“Those S.O.B.’s will never split 
that reward with anyone who hasn’t 
got his claim staked and ready to 
fight,” he had said. 

He had come to stake his claim. 

His shock on seeing this second 
creature was like a multitude of 
flames burning inside him. He was 
aware of the heat rising along his 
spine and searing his brain. Fear! 
Trembling, he raised his rifle. 

As he did so, the creature — 
which had been bending down — 
came up with something that glinted 



whistled past Matlin’s head and 
struck a tree behind him with an 
impact like a clap of thunder. The 
ground trembled. An instant later, 
the sound of an explosion came to 
Matlin’s ears. 

The explosion was loud enough to 
have come from a small cannon. 

Even as he made the mental com- 
parison from his experience as a 
Marine in World War II, the dis- 
tant rifle — it looked like a rifle, 
though a huge one — spat flame 
again. This time the bullet struck the 
rock ten yards in front of Matlin 
and sprayed him with a shower of 
rock splinters. His body stung all 
over, and when he was able to look 
again — after the second explosion 
had echoed from the distance — 
he saw that his hands were covered

with dozens of droplets of his 
blood. 

The sight was both terrifying and 
galvanizing. He slid back, rolled 
over, half-clawed to his feet and, 
bending low, ran to the gully’s end, 
stopping only when he realized that 
it was becoming too shallow to be a 
shelter. 

What could he do? 

S hadowy memories came of war- 
time risks he had taken. At the 
time he had felt enforced, compelled 
by the realities of a war he never ac- 
cepted — a war that had wasted 
several years of his life. But he re- 
membered moving, crouching, going 
forward. He had always thought 
what a mad thing it was for a sen- 
sible person to force himself into 
enemy territory. Yet under the hated 
pressure of wartime discipline, he 
had resignedly gone into the most 
deadly situations. 

Was it possible he would have to 
do that now — because of his own 
foolishness in coming here? 

As he crouched there, appalled, 
two more cannonlike shells splatter- 
ed the rock where he had been sec- 
onds before. A cannon against a 
rifle! Matlin wanted out, wanted 
away. The angry scheme he had had 
to get for himself whatever might 
be at the end of this search had no 
meaning in the face of the firepower 
that was seeking his destruction with 
each booming shot. 

He lay cringing at the shallow 
end of the gully, not even daring 
to raise his head. 

His own rifle seemed like a mere 
toy now . 



T he phone rang. When Cora an- 
swered, it took her several mo- 
ments to recognize the hoarse voice 
at the other end as her husband’s. 

“I’m calling from a roadside pay 
phone. Can you find out where that 
monster-hunting expedition is now?” 
he said. 

“Mamie just called. They were 
over at her farm. Why?” 

“It’s chasing me,” he said. “Tell 
’em I’m coming toward the high- 
way from the boathouse. It’s driving 
a dump truck as big as a house.” 
“What’s chasing you?” Cora 
yelled into the mouthpiece. 
“Where?” 

“A second one of the monsters. 
On that back road to the lake,” Mat- 
lin moaned. And hung up. 

Ill 

T he battle on the highway be- 
gan about two o’clock in the 
afternoon. The creature climbed out 
of the cab of a dump truck that 
stood twenty feet high. Crouching 
behind the vehicle, it fired with a 
rifle the size of a cannon at any- 
thing that moved. 

The two dozen men with their 
frail cars and tiny rifles crouched in 
the underbrush. Lying beside Gra- 
ham, Matlin heard the man say ur- 
gently to an army major: “Call 
again for an air strike!” 

It was about ten minutes after 
that that the first helicopter appear- 
ed on the horizon. It turned out to 
be an enterprising TV station’s ve- 
hicle, with cameras aboard. The 
fluttering monstrosity of flying ma- 
chine circled the dump truck, tak- 



10 



IF 




ing pictures of the great being be- 
side it. At first it did not seem to 
occur to the creature to look at the 
sky for the source of the sound. 
But suddenly it got the idea. 

Up came that long rifle. The 
first bullet smashed through the 
cockpit. A splinter from somewhere 
hit the pilot and knocked him un- 
conscious. The helicopter flew off 
erratically. As it retreated, another 
gigantic bullet smashed its tail. The 
stricken whirlibird fluttered down 
among the trees on the other side of 
a low hill. 

Worse, when the military heli- 
copters arrived, they no longer had 
the advantage of surprise. The can- 
non-rifle fired at them as they ap- 
proached. They veered off — but not 
before three went down, one in 
flames. With one exception, the oth- 
ers began to shoot back from a dis- 
tance. 

The exception flew off to the left, 
disappearing low behind a hill. It 
reappeared presently to the rear of 
the monster and, while the other 
machines kept up a barrage from in 
front, this lone helicopter came in 
on the target from behind. 

The barrage of bullets that its 
pilot loosed downward almost tore 
off the great head of a creature 
which did not even see where the 
death came from. 

M atlin walked forward with the 
others, angrily fingering the 
“claim” he had written out. It in- 
furiated him that they were not of- 
fering to honor his rights. Even 
though he had expected it, the real- 
ity was hard to take. 



Arrived at the truck, he stood im- 
patiently by while the men examined 
the creature, the huge vehicle and 
the rifle. Matlin was drawn abrupt- 
ly out of his irritated self-absorption 
with the realization that he, had been 
twice addressed. Graham indicated 
the ten-foot rifle. 

“What do you make of that?” 

The question approach, the appeal 
to him on an equal basis, momentar- 
ily neutralized the timeless anger in 
Matlin. “Now!” he thought. He 
handed Graham his claim with the 
request, “I’d like you to sign this.” 
Then he bent down beside the huge 
weapon and examined it. 

He commented presently, “Looks 
like a pump action repeater, much 
like the one Tve got, only many 
times as big. Could have been 
made by the same company.” 

It irritated him as he spoke to 
realize that Graham still held the 
claim sheet in his hand; had not 
even glanced at it. 

Graham said in an odd tone, 
“What company?” 

“Mine is a Messer,” said Matlin. 

Graham sighed and shook his 
head in bewilderment. “Take a look 
at the nameplate on that big gun,” 
he said. 

Matlin bent down. The word, 
“MESSER-made”, stared back at 
him in indented, black metal letter- 
ing. 

“And what’s the name of your 
dump truck?” Graham asked. 

Silently, Matlin loped around to 
the front of the over-sized truck, 
and peered up at the letters. They 
were exactly the same as on his own 
dump truck: FLUG. 



THE REPLICATORS 



M 




When Matlin returned with the 
identification, Graham nodded, and 
then handed him back his claim 
sheet, and said evenly, “If I were 
to write that claim, Mr. Matlin, it 
would read: ‘As the man who has 
done the most to prevent the crea- 
ture from space being traced down, 
I recognize myself — ’ meaning you, 
Mr. Matlin — ‘as the one person 
least qualified to receive the re- 
ward.’ ” 

It was such an unexpected reac- 
tion, so instantly threatening to his 
rights, so totally negative, that Mat- 
lin blanched. But he was stopped by 
the words only for a moment. Then 
the anger poured. 

“Why, you damned swindler!” he 
began. 

“Wait!” Graham spoke piercingly, 
raised his hand in a warning ges- 
ture. His steely gray eyes were cyn- 
ical as he continued: “Now, if you 
were to lead us onto the real back- 
track, help us locate these creatures, 
I’ll reconsider that judgment. Will 
you?” 

N ight came and caught them on 
the hunt. 

As the monster-hunting expedi- 
tion camped beside the lake, the 
darkness was shattered by a thun- 
derous roaring sound. Matlin tum- 
bled from .the back seat of his car, 
ran to the lake shore, and peered 
across the dark waters toward the 
island in the lake’s center. He was 
aware of other men coming up be- 
hind and beside him. 

It was from the island that the 
noise came. 

“Sounds like a whole battery of 



jet engines,” somebody yelled above 
the roar, “and it seems to be com- 
ing this way.” 

Abruptly, the truth of that was 
borne out. The jet sound was sud- 
denly above them. Framed in a patch 
of dark blue sky, a monstrous sized 
helicopter was momentarily visible. 

It disappeared into a cloud bank. 
The great roaring receded, became a 
remote throb. 

In the darkness, Graham came up 
beside Matlin, said, “Didn’t you tell 
me you had a lakeside cabin near 
here?” 

“Yeh.” Matlin said wary. 

“Got a boat there?” 

Matlin jumped to a horrid con- 
clusion. “You’re not thinking of go- 
ing over to the island?” he gulped. 
“Now!” 

Graham said earnestly, “We’ll pay 
you for the rent of the boat, and 
guarantee you against damages — in 
writing. And if that’s the base these 
creatures operate from, I’ll sign your 
claim.” 

Matlin hesitated. The boat and the 
lakefront property were his one 
dream. No one, not even Cora, had 
ever realized how much they meant 
to him. On the very day that he had 
killed the first monster, he had taken 
a load of sand from his farm and 
dumped it lovingly on the water’s 
edge. 

Standing there, Matlin visualized 
what the reward money would do 
for his dream: the rough shoreline 
fully sanded in, a hunting and fish- 
ing lodge, and a larger boat, the 
kind he had often fantasied but never 
managed to acquire. 

“I’ll do it,” he said. 



12 



IF 




On the island, using his flashlight 
sparingly, Matlin led Graham and 
two other men to where the ground 
suddenly felt . harder. 

When they dug down, they found 
metal bare inches under the grass. 

Graham talked softly by two- 
way radio to the camp they had left 
and then held his radio for Matlin 
and himself to hear the answer: a 
parachute army would be called by 
way of the more powerful radio at 
the camp. By dawn, several hundred 
seasoned men with tanks, demolition 
units, and cannon would be down 
with them. 

But, as the radio shut off, they 
were alone once more in the dark. 
The reinforcements of the morning 
were still hours away. 

It was Matlin — again — who found 
the overhang that led into a huge, 
brightly lighted ship. 

H e was so intent, and interested, 
that he was inside the first 
chamber with the others before he 
clearly realized how far he had 
come. 

He stopped. He half turned to 
run. But he didn’t move. 

The scene held him. 

They were in a circular room 
about 400 feet in diameter. A num- 
ber of solidly built metallic extru- 
sions came up from the floor or 
down from ceiling. Except for them 
the room was empty. 

Matlin went with the others to 
where a ramp led down to the next 
level. Here there were more of the 
huge, built-in machines — if that was 
what they were — but this level, also, 
was deserted. 



On the third level, they found two 
sleeping “children”. 

Each lay on its back in a long, 
black, metal, box-like structure. The 
larger was about half the size of a 
full-grown alien, the smaller a mere 
bit of a thing two feet long. Both 
were stocky of body and were, un- 
mistakably, younger versions of the 
two creatures that had already been 
killed. 

As the three men — Graham and 
the two officers — glanced at each 
other questioningly, Matlin drew out 
his claim sheet, and held it toward 
Graham. The government agent gave 
him a startled look; then, evidently 
realizing Matlin meant it, he nodded 
resignedly, took the pen and signed. 

The moment he had the claim 
sheet back in his hands, Matlin head- 
ed for the ramp. 

He was sweating now with fear. 
Yet he realized he had had no alter- 
native. He had to have that sig- 
nature. But now — 

. Get away from all this stuff 
that was none of his business! 

When he reached the lakeshore, 
he started the motor of the motor- 
boat, and headed back toward his 
boathouse. He locked up the boat, 
walked stealthily through the dark- 
ness to his car, and drove off. 

As he came out of the line of 
trees a mile from his farm, he saw 
the entire yard was on fire. He heard 
the thunder of gigantic engines — 

His house, his barn, his machine 
shed — all were burning! In the vivid, 
fitful light from the flames he saw 
the huge helicopter lift up from the 
far side and soar up into the night 
sky.

So that was where it had gone! 

It passed by above him somewhat 
to his right, a colossal sound, the 
source of which was now completely 
invisible in the darkness of an over- 
cast sky. 

Matlin found Cora and the son 
that was not away at school crouch- 
ing in the field. She mumbled some- 
thing about the monster having come 
over and looked down at them. She 
said wonderingly, “How did it know 
this was your farm? That’s what I 
don’t understand.” 

IV 

T he fire was dwindling. People 
were beginning to drive into the 
yard. Car doors slammed. In the 
fading brightness, Matlin in a be- 
mused state carried his son and 
walked beside Cora to his station 
wagon. 

He was having a different kind of 
thought. Why hadn’t the creature 
killed his wife and child? Cora and 
the boy had been as completely at 
its mercy as the farm. 

A neighbor named Dan Gray 
touched his arm and said, “How 
about you and Cora and the boy 
staying at my place tonight, Steve?” 
By the time they got over on the 
Gray farm, a man was on TV de- 
scribing how Steve Matlin had left 
three men at the mercy of the re- 
turning alien. 

He named Matlin. 

Matlin recognized the man who 
was talking as a member of the 
monster-hunting expedition. 

He glanced around, saw that 
Gray, Gray’s wife — a tall, thin worn- 

14 



an — and Cora were staring at him. 
Cora said in horror: “Steve, you 
didn't!” 

Matlin was amazed. “I’m going 
to sue that fellow for libel!” he 
yelled. 

“Then it isn’t true,” Cora wailed. 
“What an awful thing for them to 
say such a lie!” 

Matlin was outraged at her mis- 
understanding. “It’s not a lie, just a 
bunch of baloney. Why should I stay 
on that island? If they want to be 
crazy, that’s their business.” 

He saw from their faces that his 
perfectly obvious truth was not ob- 
vious to them. He became grim. 
“Okay, I can see I’m no longer wel- 
come. Come along, Cora.” 

Mrs. Gray said, tightlipped, “Cora 
and the boy can stay.” 

Matlin was quite willing, already 
at peace with their foolishness. “I’ll 
pick you up in the morning,” he 
said to his wife. 

Cora did not reply. 

Gray accompanied Matlin to his 
car. When he came back into the 
living room, he was shaking his 
head. He said to Cora, “One thing 
about that husband of yours. He let* 
you know where he stands.” 

Cora said stiffly, “He’s let me 
know once too often. Imagine leav- 
ing those men!” There were tears in 
her eyes. 

“He says they lured him over to 
the island.” 

“Nobody lures Steve. His own 
scheming got him over there.” 

“He says he suddenly realized the 
generals had done it again — got a 
private into the front line. And since 
this was not his war — ” 

IF 




“If it isn’t his war, whose is it? 
He fired the first shot.” 

“Well, anyway, the generals are 
on the firing line, and no one could 
care less than Steve. I can tell you 
that.” 

“That’s the astonishing thing,” 
said Cora, wonderingly. “He thinks 
World War II was a conspiracy to 
waste his time. He lives entirely in 
his own private world. Nothing can 
shake him, as you just saw.” 

M atlin drove back to his farm 
and slept there in the back of 
his car. 

When he returned to the Gray 
farm in the morning, Dan Gray 
came out to meet him. He was grin- 
ning. He said, “Well, Steve, it’s 
finally going to be your war.” 
Matlin stared at the knowing smile 
on the somewhat heavy face of his 
neighbor, but the words seemed 
meaningless. So he made no reply 
but simply got out of his car and 
walked into the house. 

The two women were watching 
the TV. Matlin did not even glance 
at the picture. 

“Ready, Cora?” he said. 

Both women turned and looked 
at him strangely. Finally, Mrs. Gray 
said breathlessly, “You’re taking it 
very calmly.” 

“Taking what calmly?” 

Mrs. Gray looked helplessly at 
Cora. “I can’t tell him,” she almost 
whispered. 

Matlin glanced questioningly at 
his wife. She said, “You might as 
well hear it. The creature came back 
and found Mr. Graham and his two 
companions on the island. And it 



talked to them through some kind of 
mechanical translation device. It said 
it was going to leave earth but thal 
first it was going to accomplish one 
thing. It said — it said — ” 

Matlin said impatiently, “For 
Pete’s sake, Cora, let’s go. You can 
tell me on the way.” 

Cora said, “It said — it was going 
to kill you first.” 

For once Matlin was speechless. 
At last he stammered: “Me!” Af- 
ter a moment, he added, incredulous, 
“That’s ridiculous. I haven’t anything 
to do with this business.” 

“It says you’re the only one on 
earth who made it your business.” 

f'qphe shock was growing on Mat- 
A lin. He could not speak, could 
not deny the charge in words. Inside 
his head, he protested silently: “But 
that first beast was coming toward 
me. How was I supposed to know?” 
Cora was continuing in a grief- 
filled voice: “It says that on all the 
planets it’s visited, no one has ever 
before killed without warning, with- 
out asking any questions.” 

Matlin stared at her with hope- 
less eyes. He felt battered, defeated, 
ultimately threatened. For a moment, 
again, he could scarcely believe. He 
thought: “I only want to be left 
alone!” 

The thought stopped. Because he 
knew suddenly that all these years 
he had been maintaining an un- 
truth: that what went on elsewhere 
was none of his affair. 

He had pretended so hard, gone 
into such instant rages, that other 
people simply glanced at each other 
significantly and fell silent, and

thereafter never brought up the sub- 
ject again. He had always thought 
with satisfaction, “By damn, they’d 
better not say anything but — ” con- 
temptuously — “let them think what 
they want.” 

And now, he was the only human 
being that a visitor from another 
planet felt motivated to kill . 

He grew aware once more of Dan 
Gray’s smile. The man spread his 
hands helplessly. “I can’t help it, 
Steve. Believe it or not, I like you. 
I even think I understand you. But 
— forgive me, Cora — this seems to 
me to he a case of poetic justice. 1 
can’t think of anyone else who’s had 
something like this coming to him 
for so long.” 

Matlin turned and walked out of 
the room. He was aware of Cora 
following him hastily. “Just a min- 
ute, Steve,” she said, “I have some- 
thing for you.” 

Matlin turned. They were alone in 
the hallway. He grew aware that 
she was tugging at her wed- 
ding ring. “Here,” she said, “I 
should have given you this nineteen 
years ago, but I let the coming of 
our first child stop me.” 

# Sh e opened his palm, placed the 
ring in it. and closed his fingers over 
it. “You’re on your own, Steve. Af- 
ter twenty years of being the most 
selfish, ^elf-centered man in the 
world. yOu can face this as you 
should, by yourself.” 

Matlin scowled down at the ring, 
then: “Bah! When you look at me, 
vo" f be human race as it really 
is. I’ve never gone in for the shams, 
that’s all.” 

He slipped the ring into his pocket. 



“I’m going to keep this and give it 
back to you when you get over this 
foolish feeling. My feeling for you 
was never a sham.” 

He turned and walked out of the 
room and out of the house. 

A car was pulling up in front of 
the Gray house. John Graham 
was inside it. He climbed out and 
walked over to where Matlin was 
about to get into his station wagon, 
said, “I came over to see you.” 
“Make it quick!” said Matlin. 

“I have three messages for you.” 
“Shoot!” 

“Obviously,” said Graham, “the 
U.S. government will not allow one 
of its citizens to be casually ex- 
terminated.” 

Accordingly — he continued for- 
mally — all of the armed forces would 
be interposed between Steve Matlin 
and the alien. 

Matlin stared at him with uncom- 
promising hostility. “He can dupli- 
cate anything we’ve got, so those are 
just big words.” 

Graham said in the same formal 
way that the ability of the creature 
to duplicate, first, the rifle, then the 
truck, and then the helicopter, had 
been taken note of by the military. 

Matlin’s curt laugh dismissed as 
asinine the notion that the generals 
would know what to do with such 
information. “C’mon, c’mon,” he 
said roughly, “what’s the second 
message?” 

“It’s personal,” said Graham. 

He stepped forward. His fist came 
up, connected perfectly with Mat- 
lin’s jaw. Matlin was knocked back 
against his car. He sank to the 



16 



IF 




ground, sat there rubbing his jaw 
and looking up at Graham. He said 
in an even tone: “Just about every- 
body seems to agree I had that com- 
ing to me, so I’ll take it. What’s the 
last message?” 

Graham, who had evidently ex- 
pected a battle, stepped back. His 
savage mood softened. He shook his 
head wonderingly. “Steve,” he said, 
“you amaze me. Maybe I even re- 
spect you.” 

Matlin said nothing. He just sat 
there, elbows on knees. 

After a moment, Graham contin- 
ued : “The way the generals figure 
it, there’s got to be another reason 
why the creature wants to kill you. 
Maybe you know something.” His 
gray eyes watched Matlin closely. 
“Have you been holding anything 
back?” 

Matlin shook his head but he was 
interested. He climbed slowly to his 
feet, frowning, thoughtful as he 
dusted himself off. 

Graham persisted. “It is proposed 
that its ability to duplicate is based 
upon a kind of perception that 
human beings don’t have.” 

“Hey!” said Matlin, eyes wide. 
“You mean like the homing pigeon, 
or birds flying south, or salmon com- 
ing back to their little pool where 
they were bom?” 

“The reasoning is,” said Graham, 
“that you got some feedback on 
whatever it is, and so the creature 
wants to kill you before you can 
pass on to anybody else what you 
know.” 

Matlin was shaking his head. 
“They’re off their rocker. I don’t 
know a thing.” 



G raham watched him a moment 
longer. Then, clearly satisfied, 
he said, “Anyway, the military feel 
that they can’t take a chance with a 
creature that has made a death 
threat against an American citizen. 
So they’re going to drop an atomio 
bomb on it and end the matter once 
and for all.” 

For some reason, ■ Matlin felt an 
instant alarm. “Just a minute,” ho 
said doubtfully. “Suppose it dupli- 
cates that? Then it’ll have everything 
we’ve got, and we still won’t have 
seen a thing ifs got.” 

Graham was tolerant. “Oh, come 
now, Steve. The bomb will be e 
small one but the right size to pul- 
verize that spaceship. I personally 
feel strong regrets about this but I 
have no doubt of the outcome. Once 
the bomb drops, it’ll have nothing to 
duplicate with — and it won’t be 
around to do any duplicating.” 
Matlin said, “Better tell them to 
hold that bomb till they’ve thought 
about it some more.” 

Graham was looking at his watch. 
“I’m afraid it’s a little late for that, 
Steve. Because they figured you 
might have some telepathic connec- 
tion with this creature, I’ve been 
holding back the fact that the bomb 
is being dropped — right — now!” 

As he spoke, there was a sound of 
distant thunder. 

Involuntarily, the two men 
ducked. Then they straightened and 
looked over the near farms, past the 
trees in the distance, beyond the low 
hills. A small but familiar and sin- 
ister mushroom was rising from the 
other side of the horizon. 

“Well,” said Graham, “that does

j It Too bad. But it shouldn’t have 
made that threat against you.” 
“What about the other ship?” 
Matlin asked. 

“What other ship?” said Graham. 
They had both spoken involuntar- 
ily; Now, they stared at each other. 
‘ feraham broke the silence. “Oh, 
my God!” he said. 

V 

T here were stubborn people at 
G.H.Q. 

For two decisive days, they re- 
jected the idea that there might be 
another ship. 

Then, late in the afternoon of the 
third day, radar reported a small ob- 
ject high above fiefld H from which 
the atomic plane had taken off to 
destroy the spaceship on the island. 

Control tower challenged the ap- 
proaching airborne machine. When 
there was no response, somebody 
became anxious and sounded a bomb 
alarm. Then he dived down a chute 
lhat took him head first into a shel- 
ter far below. 

His quick action made him one of 
about 800 fast-reflex people who 
■urvived. 

Seconds after he made his dive 
p safety, an atomic bomb demol- 
ished field H. 

About the same time, a TV heli- 
copter was hovering above the island 
In Matlin’s lake, taking pictures of 
the bomb crater there. Suddenly a 
spaceship came silently down from 
fet great height and landed. 

The helicopter did not tarry. It 
look rear view pictures as it was 
fleeing the scene. 

w 



Graham went to see Cora, look- 
ing for Matlin. 

But she could only shake her 
head. “Steve said he was going on 
the road till this whole thing blew 
over. He said he figured he’d better 
not be sitting still when that creature 
came looking for him.” 

They put Matlin’s photo on TV 
On the fourth day after that, 
Graham interviewed four sullen 
young men who had tried to seize 
Matlin, their intention being to de- 
liver him to the monster. As their 
spokesman put it, “By handing over 
the one guy who was really involved 
in this business, the rest of us could 
have gone back to our daily affairs.” 
They filed out, one on crutches, 
two with arms in slings, all ban- 
daged in some way, groaning a little. 

The following day, Graham in- 
terrogated two people who claimed 
to have witnessed a duel on an open 
stretch of highway between Matlin 
in a station wagon and the monster 
flying an enormous jet plane. Mat- 
lin had had a bazooka and the beast 
had finally beat a retreat. 

General Maxwell Day, who was 
with Graham, wondered aloud if 
Matlin might not be the man who 
had raided a Marine armory and 
taken a 3.5 rocket launcher and a 
quarter of a ton of ammunition for 
it. 

Graham phoned Cora. “I’m 
checking a report,” he said. “Would 
Steve have thought of utilizing 
Marine equipment?” 

Cora answered carefully: “That 
weapon belonged to the people of 
the U.S., didn’t it?” 

“Yes.” 

IF 




“Well, then, I think Steve would 
regard himself as part owner, as a 
citizen, and without any guilt since 
he would consider either that he 
paid for it with taxes or earned it 
in World War II.” 

Graham put his hand over the 
mouthpiece, said, “I gather he would 
have thought of such a thing.” 

The Marine officer held his hand 
out for the phone. “Let me talk to 
her,” he said. A moment later: 
“Mrs. Matlin?” 

“Yes?” 

“May I ask you some very per- 
sonal questions about your hus- 
band?” 

“You may.” 

“Now, Mrs. Matlin, Mr. Graham 
here has the highest respect for your 
opinions, so think carefully about 
this one: Is your husband intelli- 
gent?” 

Cora hesitated; then: “I know ex- 
actly what you mean. On some lev- 
els, no; on others, extremely intel- 
ligent.” 

“Is he brave?” 

“To hear him talk, no. But my 
feeling is, totally. I think you’d have 
to engage his interest, though.” 
“What does he think of generals?” 
“They’re idiots.” 

“Is he an honest man?” 
“We-1-1-1-1, that depends. For ex- 
ample, he had that rifle along that 
first day in ‘ the hope that he’d be 
able to kill a deer illegally.” 

“I mean is he responsible for his 
debts?” 

“If I may quote him — he wouldn’t 
give the so and so’s the satisfaction 
of owing them money.” 

General Day smiled. “Now, Mrs. 



Matlin, would you take your hut- 
band back if I made a sergeant out 
of him?” 

“Why not a captain?” 

“I’m sorry, Mrs. Matlin, if you’ll 
think a little bit, you’ll realize thaf 
he'd never sink that low.” 

“Oh, I don’t have to think. You’re 
right. Well — yes, I might take him 
back. B-but he’s not in the Marines 
anymore.” 

“He will be, Mrs. Matlin. Good- 
by.” 

He hung up. 

An hour later it was announced 
on TV, radio and the newspapers 
that Matlin had been re-inducted in- 
to the Marines, and that he was or- 
dered to report to the nearest 
Marine station. 

A bout midnight that night a jet, 
with Graham and several of- 
ficers aboard, flew down to the 
Marine base where Matlin was re- 
signedly waiting for them. They se- 
cured a Marine private’s uniform. 
As the grim, unshaved man reluc- 
tantly donned it, they interrogated 
him. They were interested in any 
thought whatsoever that may have 
flitted through Matlin’s mind for any 
reason. 

Matlin objected: “That’s crazy. 
I don’t know anything special — ex- 
cept the thing is out to get me.” 
“We think you do.” 

“But that’s a lot of — ” 

“Private Matlin! That’s an order!” 
Glumly — but thoroughly — Matlin 
complied with the orders. He told 
them everything that had passed 
through his mind about the creature 
in the past few days. And there had 



20 



IF 




been things, many things, things 
that had seemed crazy and distorted 
to him, until he thought he was be- 
ginning to lose his mind. Visions of 
a home on a planet of another star. 
Visions of long, long years of travel. 
Visions of the buried ship at the 
lake, where thousands of atomic 
bombs were in process of being dup- 
licated. 

His listeners turned pale, but Gra- 
ham urged, “Go on.” 

Matlin continued: There was only 
one creature, but it had brought with 
it a number of spare bodies and 
could grow even more. 

Then he stopped. “Damn it,” he 
growled, “I don’t like to say this 
stuff! Why do you want to hear it, 
anyway? It’s just crazy dreams.” 
Graham glanced at the Marine 
commander, then at Matlin. He said, 
“Matlin, we don’t think it’s dreams 
at all. We think that you are in re- 
sonance — somehow! — with the crea- 
ture’s mind. And we need to know 
what it has in its mind — so, for 
heaven’s sake, go on!” 

T he story, by the time Matlin got 
through piecing it together, 
made a pattern: 

The alien had arrived in the solar 
system in two ships, with its bodies 
in various growth stages and evenly 
distributed between the two vessels. 
When one ship — and its cargo of 
bodies — was later destroyed, it made 
a duplicate, and now again had two. 

As body after body was de- 
stroyed, the next in line was trig- 
gered into rapid growth and awak- 
ened to full adulthood in about two 
days. Each new body had the com- 



plete “memory” of what had hap- 
pened to the ones that preceded it; 
it automatically recorded by ESP 
everything that happened to its pre- 
ceding self. 

On arrival, the first body had 
awakened in a state of total recep- 
tiveness. It had wanted to be able 
to duplicate the thoughts and feel- 
ings of the inhabitants of’ this newiy 
found planet. 

— Be like them, think like them, 
know their language — 

It was in this helpless, blank con- 
dition, when it stumbled on Steve 
Matlin. 

And that was the story. The crea- 
ture had been imprinted with the 
personality of Matlin. 

Graham said, “Steve, do you real- 
ize that this being got all these de- 
structive ideas from vou?” 

Matlin blinked. “Huh!” 

Graham, remembering some 
things that Cora had told him, said, 
“Do you have any friends, Steve? 
Anybody you like? Anybody any- 
where ?” 

Matlin could think of no one. Ex- 
cept, of course, Cora and the kids. 
But his feelings about them were 
not unmixed. She had insisted on 
sending the three older children to 
school in town. But he did feel a 
genuine affection for her, and them, 
at some level. 

Graham said tensely, “That’s why 
she’s alive. That’s why the creature 
didn’t kill her the day it burned your 
farm.” 

“B-but — ” Matlin protested, “why 
destroy the farm?” 

“You hate the damn place, don’t 
you?” 



THE REPLICATORS

Matlin was silent. He’d said it a 
thousand times. 

“What do you think we ought to 
do with about half the people in 
this country, Steve?” 

“I think we ought to wipe the 
human race off the map and start 
over again,” said Matlin automat- 
ically. 

“What do you think we ought to 
do with the Russians?” 

“If I had my way,” said Matlin, 
“we’d go over there and plaster the 
whole of Asia with atomic bombs.” 
After a little, Graham said softly, 
“Like to change any of those ideas, 
Steve?” 

Matlin, who had finished dress- 
ing, scowled into a mirror. “Look,” 
he said finally, “you’ve got me 
where I can’t hit back. And I’m 
ready to be loused up by what the 
idiot generals have got in their crazy 
noodles. So tell me what you want 
me to do.” 

A 1 lX) Hl ‘juoraoui ospaid jBip 
** ceased its feverish duplication 
of man’s atomic bombs . and be- 
came itself. 

Its compulsive mental tie with 
Matlin was severed. 

Shuddering, That made a report, 
on an instantaneous relay-wave 
transmitter whose receiver was light- 
years away: 

“What w'e always feared would 
happen on one of these blank mind 
approaches to a new planet finally 
happened to me. While I was enor- 
mously receptive to any thought, my 
first body was destroyed by a two- 
legged inhabitant of this system, a 
being with the most incredible ideas 



— which are apparently due to some 
early mistreatment. This inability to 
slough off early shock conditioning 
seems to be a unique phenomenon 
of the people of this planet. 

“Realizing how trapped I was 
while he remained alive, I made sev- 
eral attempts to kill him. 1 was un- 
successful in this because he turned 
out to be unexpectedly resourceful. 
But he has now put on a suit called 
a uniform, and this has immediately 
turned him into a peaceful person. 

“Thus I was able to free myself. 
Naturally, I can still sense where he 
is, but he can no longer receive my 
thoughts nor I his. However, 1 must 
report that I am pinned down here 
by an air fleet. My image as a good- 
will visitor has been completely nul- 
lified by what has happened. Ob- 
viously, I won’t use any weapons 
against them; so perhaps this expedi- 
tion is doomed.” 

A team of astronauts was sent up. 
The team successfully boarded 
That's second spaceship, reporting 
that it was occupied by four bodies 
in various growth stages. 

Even as they blew up the ship in 
its silent orbit, on earth Matlin was 
driven to the edge of the lake. There, 
a government launch was provided 
him. While Graham and General 
Day watched through binoculars, 
Matlin drove the $30,000 craft right 
onto the beach of the island, careless 
of any damage to it. 

“I think he smashed the launch,” 
said Graham. 

“Good.” 

“Good?” 

“My whole theory about him 
would collapse if he treated govern- 



22 



IF 




ment property with the same care 
that he gave his own possessions. It 
reassures me that he’s exactly the 
man I thought.” 

Matlin came to where the second 
alien ship lay at the bottom of the 
blast pit. Water had filtered down 
into the clay. Having his orders, 
Matlin dutifully slid down into the 
goo. He held his rifle high, cursed, 
and started for the entrance. 

VI 

G raham, General Day, and an ar- 
tillery major watched Matlin’s 
progress on a portable TV. The pic- 
ture was coming from a ship some 
70,000 feet above the island. The 
scene below was crystal clear. 
Through the marvelous telescopic 
lens, Matlin actually looked like a 
tiny human being walking. 

“But why send anyone?” Graham 
protested. “Why not just blast it? 
As you’ve already pointed out, 
we’ve got enough power up there — ” 
he indicated the sky above — “to ex- 
terminate him.” 

General Day explained that he 
now favored Graham’s earlier view. 
The alien might be able to defend it- 
self. 

“But it’s too late for caution,” 
Graham interjected. “We’ve burned 
our bridges.” 

It would be unwise, the Marine 
officer explained, to provoke the 
creature further until a confronta- 
tion had taken place. 

“A confrontation between a 
super-being — and Matlin!” 

“Who else should we send? Some 
poor devil? No, Matlin is oriented 



to this. Seeing the creature face oa 
is not a new experience to him aa 
it would be to some other lower 
ranks.” 

“Why not send you? Me?” 

Day answered in a steady voice 
that such decisions as were re- 
quired here should not be made by 
people who reasoned on the basis 
of official attitudes. 

“How do you think I got to be 
a general? When in doubt, I listened 
to what the men thought. They 
have a basic canniness that trans- 
cends intellect.” 

With an effort, Graham recover- 
ed. “You heard Matlin’s basic 
truth,” he said. “His opinion of the 
human race — ” 

General Day gave him a surprised 
look. “You mean to tell me that 
isn’t your opinion also?” 

“No.” 

“You don’t think that human be- 
ings are absolutely impossible?” 

“No, I think they’re pretty terri- 
fic,” said Graham. 

“Boy, are you far gone,” said 
the general in a tolerant voice. “1 
can see that we Marines have an un- 
derstanding of human behavior that 
beats all you brain-washed people.” 
He broke off. “Matlin was badly 
handled in World War II.” 

“What?” Graham groped. 

“You ask, what has that got to 
do with it? Plenty. You see, Mr. 
Graham, you have to understand 
that a true Marine is a king. Now, 
Matlin is the true Marine type. But 
he was treated like an ordinary 
private. He never got over it; so 
he’s been seething for 20 years, 
waiting for recognition. I’m giving

it to him. A king Marine, Mr. 
Graham, can direct a war, take com- 
mand of a city, or negotiate with a 
foreign power like a government. 
Marines who get to be generals are 
considered sub-level versions of this 
species. All Marines understand this 
perfectly. It will not occur to Matlin 
to consult me, or you, or the U.S. 
Government. He’ll size up the situ- 
ation, make a decision, and I shall 
back him up.” 

He turned to the major, com- 
manded, “All right, start firing!” 

“Firing!” Graham yelled. 

Day explained patiently as to a 
child that it was necessary in this 
extreme emergency to reindoctrinate 
this particular Marine, and grind in 
the simple truth — to him — that 
generals always loused things up. 
M A quick reminder, that’s all, Mr. 
Graham.” 

M atlin was still skidding around 
in the mud when the first 
shell landed to his left. It sprayed 
him with fine droplets of wet dirt. 
The second shell landed to his right. 
The debris from it missed him en- 
tirely, but he was now in such state 
of rage that he didn’t notice. 

By the time the shelling ceased, 
his anger was gone and he was in 
that peculiar state of mind which 
can only be described with one 
word: Marine. 

The man who presently entered 
the alien ship knew that life was 
tough, that other people could not 
be trusted, that no one cared about 
him. It was a truth he had always 
fought with bitterness and rage. 

But there was no longer any 



doubt in his mind. People were what 
they were. They would shoot you in 
the back if they couldn’t get you 
from in front. 

Understanding this, you could be 
friendly with them, shake their 
hands, enjoy their company — and 
be completely free of any need to 
judge them or condemn them. 

But you were on your own, day 
and night, year in and out. 

As he saw the creature, Matlin 
used his gun for the purpose that he 
had brought it. Deliberately, he 
tossed it down. It struck the metal 
floor with a clatter. 

The echoes of the sound faded — 
and there was silence. Alien and 
human stood there staring. 

Matlin waited. 

S uddenly, the hoped-for voice 
came from a speaker in the 
ceiling: 

“I am talking to you through a 
computer, which is translating my 
thoughts into your language. It will 
do the same for yours. Why have 
they sent you to me — the one man 
I threatened to kill?” 

That added: “I no longer plan to 
kill you. So you may talk freely.” 
Matlin said bluntly, “We’re trying 
to decide what to do with you. Do 
you have any suggestions?” 

“I wish to leave the planet for- 
ever. Can you arrange it?” 

Matlin was practical. Could the 
creature leave whether human be- 
ings like it or not? “No.” 

The simple negative took Matlin 
slightly aback. “You have no special 
weapons from — from where you 
come from?”

IF 




“None,” admitted the alien. 

That admission also startled Mat- 
lin. “You mean to tell me we can 
do what we want with you? You 
can’t stop us?” 

“Yes, except — ” 

Matlin wanted to know except 
what? 

The great eyes blinked at him, its 
black, fold-like eyelids rolling up 
and down in a skin and muscle com- 
plex unlike that of any creature 
Matlin had ever seen before. 

“Except that it will do you no 
good to kill me.” 

“You’d better make damn clear 
what you mean,” Matlin said. 

Watching him, That gave its ex- 
planation. 

And Matlin realized that what 
That said was true. For once in the 
history of the human race, killing 
an enemy would solve nothing. 

M atlin’s boat was almost water- 
logged by the time he success- 
fully beached it near where Graham 
and the others were waiting. 

He came up to them and saluted. 
General Day returned the salute 
smartly, and said: “Your report.” 
“I told him he could go,” said 
Matlin. “He’ll be leaving when I 
signal.” 

“What?” That was Graham, his 
voice sounding shrill and amazed 
in his own ears. “But why?” 

“Never mind why,” said General 
Day. “That’s the way it’s going to 
be.” 

He spoke into his mike: “Men, 
this alien ship is going to lift from 



here in a few minutes. Let it go 
through. A duly authorized person 
has negotiated this solution.” 

The language was not clear to 
Matlin. “Is it okay?” he asked ques- 
tioningly. 

For an instant, it seemed to 
Graham, Day hesitated. Graham 
said urgently into that instant: “At 
least, you’re going to find out what 
made him agree?” 

Day seemed to have come to a 
decision; his momentary hesitation 
ended. “Okay!” he said to Matlin. 
“Okay, sergeant.” 

Matlin raised his rifle, and fired 
it into the air. 

To Graham, Day said, “I’ve never 
lost a bet on a king Marine, and I 
don’t expect to now.” 

The interchange ended. For on 
the island, the ship was lifting. 

Silent, jetless, rocketless power 
drove it up on a slant. 

It passed over their heads, gather- 
ing speed. It grew small and, as 
they watched, became a dot and 
vanished. 

Aboard it, the creature to which 
Matlin had talked performed the 
preliminaries necessary to an inter- 
stellar voyage, and then retired to 
one of the sleep boxes. Soon it was 
in a state of suspended animation. 

Thereupon happened what the 
monster had told Matlin — the un- 
derlying reality, which made it use- 
less, unnecessary, even dangerous, to 
destroy it and its vessel. 

On a planet many light-years 
away, the real That stirred, awaken 
and sat up. END

IF • Short Story 



REPORTER AT LAREE 

BY RON GOULART 



Nothing can withstand the 
power of the press— even 
when it g s robot-directedi 



I t was a sensational front page. 

The four-color headline had 
punch, the atrocity photo had a 
pretty girl in it, the comic strip was 
surefire and the crossword puzzle 
was just difficult enough. 

“Same old slop,” said Dave Ro- 
mero, tilting back in his swivel chair 
and spreading the proof out on his 
desk. “I’ve been editor of the Ter- 
ritory Eight Press-Guardian for five 
months and I’ve never written a 
word.” 

His assistant, a tall heavyset 
young man named Merle Bockman, 
said, “So complain to Commander 
Vetterlein. He’s supposed to be stay- 
ing at his suite in the Territory Eight 
Patriotic Arms Hotel this week.” 
Commander G. B. Vetterlein 



owned forty-seven newspapers on 
Barnum and eighty-three on other 
planets. Everything that appeared in 
the Press-Guardian came from his 
news and feature syndicates. As edi- 
tor, Dave’s main function was mak- 
ing up the paper and getting every- 
thing to fit into eight pages. “What’s 
a six-letter word for scoundrel?” he 
asked Bockman. 

“Batson,” replied his assistant. 

“Who’s this guy in our first comic 
strip remind you of? This fellow 
here who seems to be deflowering 
the heroine between panels?” 

Not looking, Bockman said, “Bat- 
son.” 

Dave nodded, his dark face lin- 
ing as he frowned. He read the head- 
line aloud again. “ ‘Batson Lies, 



26 




Avers Plexus Spokesman’. Subhead: 
‘No Famine In Territory Nine’.” 
“Did you read Little Crippled 
Sally today?” 

“Yeah, where she tells her uncle 
that starvation is usually only psy- 
chosomatic. Sure.” 

Bockman moved toward the press 
room “I have a hunch that Plexus 
Enterprises is pulling a fast one with 
those surplus food warehouses.” 
“All I know is what I print in 
the paper,” said Dave. “Go ahead. 
Tell those automatic bastards to roll. 
It’s after ten and we’ve got to be 
on the stands by noon.” 

Cupping his hands Bockman yell- 
ed, “Let’er roll!” at the fully auto- 
mated press room. The presses roar- 
ed and he slid the door shut to cut 
off some of the whir. “I wonder what 
Leopoldo Batson’s really like.” 
“Let’s suggest that to Commander 
Vetterlein for tomorrow’s Inquiring 
Reporter question,” said Dave, still 
frowning at the front page. 

L eopoldo Batson had seized con- 
trol of the key cities in the 
neighboring Territory Nine some six 
months before. He still didn’t have 
complete authority, and one of his 
big problems was the Plexus Food 
Enterprises Company. Plexus had 
been paid a fee by four of the pre- 
vious governments to stockpile a 
certain amount of food from the 
many crops and meats that they 
grew, processed and packaged. Now 
that a famine had actually hit Ter- 
ritory Nine the surplus storehouses 
proved to be just about empty. 
There were rumors that Plexus 



had shifted products to other ware- 
houses, but they claimed spoilage 
and acts of god. None of this appear- 
ed in the Press-Guardian , since there 
was a strong possibility that Com- 
mander Vetterlein was a major 
shareholder in Plexus Enterprises. 
Whatever his motives, the com- 
mander seemed determined to use 
his papers to do in Leopoldo Bat- 
son. Even his papers here in Ter- 
ritory Eight. 

“Bv the way,” said Bockman. 

“Yeah?” 

“Something was delivered while 
-you were out at coffee. I put it 
back in the cloak room.” 

“What is it?” 

“A big crate, comes from the 
Vett Syndicate storerooms in the 
capital at Keystone.” 

“Are we supposed to open it?” 

“Nothing came with the crate,” 
said Bockman, nodding his head 
toward the back room of the news- 
paper offices. “It’s addressed to you 
and that’s all I know.” 

Dave stood up. “We’ll investi- 
gate.” 

A blue light flashed over Dave’s 
desk. 

“Message,” said Bockman. 

“Blue,” said Dave, dropping back 
into his chair. “Blue’s the damned 
commander’s color.” He swung his 
forefinger against the response tog- 
gle and said, “David W. Romero.” 

“Stand easy,” said a rich falsetto 
voice. On the view screen next to 
Dave’s outdrop tube appeared the 
long sharp face of a pale, gray- 
haired man. “Commander Vetterlein 
here. How’s it going, David?”

“Fine, sir,” he said smartly. 

“I’d like to see you here at my 
suite in one half of an hour,” said 
the commander and faded out. 

Dave stood up again. “Oh, boy.” 
“It could be a raise,” said Bock- 
man. 

“No, no,” said Dave. “Raises 
come out of the payhole there. But 
an in-person talk with the com- 
mander. That’s something else 
again.” 

“Shall I open the crate while 
you’re gone?” 

“Yes,” said Dave, heading for the 
door. “I s may want to use it.” 

C ommander Vetterlein laughed 
like a squeezed rubber doll. A 
tear appeared at the corner of one 
of his pale eyes and he clapped his 
hands on his knees. “Isn’t that a 
scheme to admire?” he asked Dave. 

The parlor of the suite was some 
fifty feet long with two bright, 
all-glass walls. The solid walls were 
decorated with neat rows of flags. 
The flags of the various territories, 
condominiums, nations and king- 
doms where the commander had 
papers. Dave was looking at the flags 
and not at his chief. “Yes, sir.” 
“You’re admiring my flag col- 
lection?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“The flag of one’s country,” said 
the commander’s piping voice, 
“brings tears to one’s eyes and ela- 
tion to one’s heart. You can well un- 
derstand that, being a citizen of so 
many places and planets, I can 
sometimes sit here for hours crying 
and being elated.” 



“Yes, I can understand that.” 

“Now then,” said Vetterlein, “to 
return to the details of your special 
mission. You will leave tonight, in 
a plain unmarked land car, and 
proceed to Territory Nine. Reser- 
vations have been made for you at 
the Esperanza Inn — under your 
own name, since we want no charges 
of scheming.” 

“And the Esperanza Inn is near 
this chateau?” 

“Exactly,” said the comtnander, 
smiling. “The cold stone chateau 
wherein an unsullied fairhaired young 
woman is being held prisoner and 
used for an uncountable number of 
vile purposes by Leopoldo Batson, 
the so-called liberator of Territory 
Nine.” 

Dave checked his notebook. “Her 
name is Patricia Haysen and she’s 
the daughter of the former Prime 
Minister.” 

“Right. Of old Gaylord J. Hay- 
sen himself, the territory’s leading 
warehouse rental agent and a keen 
politician.” The commander picked 
a folder from the jade-top table in 
front of his knees. “Here we have 
pictures of the girl. Bathing suit 
shot, formal dress, disheveled. We’ll 
want to run them all. More impor- 
tant are the pictures you’ll get of 
the guards doing her injustices and 
shots of her being freed and so on.” 

Dave took the photos. Patricia 
Haysen was a blonde girl in her 
early twenties, pretty and slender, 
looking somewhat reluctant. “She’s 
expecting the rescue?” 

“Her father has arranged it. 
Rented the chateau under a name

IF 




that’s pretty close to Batson,” ex- 
plained the commander. “Haysen 
has also seen to it that two de- 
fected Batson men will be on guard 
there. They will be easily overpow- 
ered.” 

“Good,” said Dave, since he would 
be doing the overpowering. 

“It’s going to be a big story,” 
said Commander Vetterlein. “It’s 
certain to look real if handled pro- 
perly. Then it will damage Batson. 
After all, nobody wants a seducer 
for a president.” 

“No, sir,” agreed Dave. 

“I have picked you, David, be- 
cause I want the story to break in 
this territory, outside of Batson’s 
stamping grounds. That will also 
make the rescue seem more daring.” 
The commander chuckled. “After 
you succeed with this, David, other 
plums will come your way.” 

“I’m glad to do it,” said Dave. 
“I’m sure my assistant can run the 
paper while I’m gone.” 

Slipping the pictures of the Hay- 
sen girl away Vetterlein said, “I’ve 
made certain that the Press-Guardian 
will function smoothly. On direct 
order from me, our Keystone store- 
rooms have sent you an android.” 
“Beg pardon?” 

“Over the years, we’ve experi- 
mented with the use of robot editors. 
They don’t have the fire and drive 
of real flesh-and-blood fellows like 
yourself but they do function effici- 
ently,” the commander said, “I have 
quite an interest in this type of 
android. I have even bought up 
large quantities of those used on 
far remote planets. Some of my 



android editors in the collection are 
well over two centuries old.” He 
laughed. “Don’t frown, David. The 
one you’ve got is brand new and 
ready to go. The latest model. Let’s 
hope it doesn’t prove too good, eh 
now?” 

So that’s what was in the crate! 
“Right, sir,” said Dave, trying not to 
frown. 

M erle Bockman, his arms folded, 
was standing in the middle of 
the editorial room. His head was 
tilted slightly to the left and his 
straight brown hair was hanging at 
an odd angle. As Dave came in he 
said, “Hello, chief.” 

“Open the crate yet?” 

“Halfway. Then I stopped.” 

“It’s supposed to be my tempor- 
ary replacement,” said Dave. 

“They come packed in excelsior 
now?” 

“It’s an android.” 

“Oh,” said Bockman. “That’s 
okay. I thought somebody was try- 
ing to give us a scoop on a trunk 
murder.” He shook his head. “Why 
do you need a replacement?” 

Dave told him about his assign- 
ment to go into the next territory 
and pretend to rescue Patricia Hay- 
sen. “Let’s get this brand new ef- 
ficient editor unpacked. I’ve got to 
leave in a couple of hours.” 

“I thought,” said Bockman, fol- 
lowing Dave to the cloakroom, 
“that I’d get to run the Press- 
Guardian when you had to leave.” 
“So did I. But you don’t seem to 
be one of the commander’s hobbies.” 
The crate lid was still down but

most of the nails had been pulled. 
“I stopped when I saw the feet.” 
said Bookman. 

Dave grabbed the lid and swung 
it up. “What the hell?” On top of 
the excelsior rested a box of cigars. 
Dave lifted it out and started scoop- 
ing the excelsior away. 

Something started whirring and 
buzzing, and then the android sud- 
denly sat up. He looked like a heavy 
middle-aged man. He had a 
speckled complexion and a thick bel- 
ligerent lower lip. Pulled down on 
his wide forehead was a green eye- 
shade. He scowled at Dave. “You, 
Junior! Who are you?” 

“Dave Romero. You’re going to 
be running the paper here during 
the day or so that I’m gone.” 

“Give me my damn cigars,” said 
the android, grabbed the box of 
cigars from Dave and jumped out of 
the crate. Glaring at Bockman the 
android said. “You! Who are you?” 
“Merle Bockman.” 

“Merle? That’s great. They give 
me a wall-eyed greenhorn named 
Merle and an undersized Romero 
and think I’m going to put out a 
paper worth reading!” 

Dave glanced down into the crate 
and saw a bill of lading. He reached 
for it. “Now that you know us, 
who the hell are you?” 

“My name-,” said the android, 
“is Howey-632.” He thumbed open 
the cigar box. “And I’m too damn 
good a city editor to be stuck 
with an operation like this.” 

T he slip in Dave’s hand read: 
“Enclosed find one (1) automatic 



editor. His name is Maximo-87 and 
to operate him simply push button 
marked edit ” To Howey-632, Dave 
said, “It says here you’re supposed 
to be Maximo-87.” 

Howey-632 laughed and lit his 
cigar with a wood match. “A lot 
they know! I’ll tell you, Dave. I’ve 
been on the shelf for a time. They 
prefer those new pansy andies but 
I knew I’d get a crack at a paper 
again. I’m going to put this sheet 
on its feet. What’s its name?” 

“The Press-Guardian ” said Dave. 
“I think, though, that you’ve been 
sent to us by mistake.” 

Howey exhaled smoke. “You 
needed a city editor. I’m it. Show me 
my desk.” 

“Merle,” said Dave, “you stay 
here and fill Howey in. I want to 
make a call.” 

Dave ran to his desk and dialed 
the Patriotic Arms. He couldn’t get 
through to the commander and had 
to talk to the image of his general 
secretary, a fat man named Bru- 
becker. 

“Aren’t you enroute yet, David?” 
asked Brubecker. 

“It’s about the android editor,” 
said Dave. “They sent us the wrong 
one and ...” 

“David. Mistakes just aren’t made 
where the commander’s hobbies are 
concerned.” Brubecker puckered his 
lips. “Don’t be a spoilsport about 
turning over the reins. It is, after all, 
only for a couple of days at most.” 
Then he was gone. 

“Junior,” called Howey-632, 
“you’re sitting in my slot. Now. 
First off I want to read a few 



30 



IF 




copies of this rag and then 1 want 
to go out and nose around this town 
and see what’s going on.” He came 
up and patted Dave on the back. 
“Where do you keep your bottle?” 
“You drink, too?” 

“I was built to do everything a 
good editor is supposed to do,” said 
Howey-632. 

“Third drawer on the left,” said 
Dave. He gave up his swivel chair 
and looked back at Bockman. “I’ll 
see you in a day or so with a big 
story.” 

Bockman didn’t speak. 

D ave traveled back roads and lit- 
tle used roadways in the gray 
land car the Vett Syndicate had 
provided him. 

It was nearly twilight now and 
he’d been driving since morning. 
He had left Territory Eight last 
night, driven several hours and then 
pulled off the road and slept a few 
hours. He crossed over into Terri- 
tory Nine a little after sunrise. 

The roads Commander Vetterlein 
had mapped out for him to take to 
the chateau were so out of the way 
that Dave hadn’t had a chance to 
pick up a copy of today’s Press- 
Guardian. He hoped Howey-632’s 
first issue was up to standard. Well, 
that was the commander’s problem 
— or his general secretary’s. 

Since Dave had come to Bar- 
num to work on the Press-Guardian 
he had done what he was told. He 
didn’t agree with Commander Vet- 
terlein’s approach or with most of 
his ideas. But Dave was anxious to 
make good on this job. He was 



twenty-seven now and he’d already 
screwed up a couple of good jobs. 
This time he’d keep quiet and fol- 
low orders. He had been here five 
months and had no trouble. He’d 
even received a raise. 

The country around him now was 
dry and nearly flat. No grass, few 
trees. Hard orange and yellow land 
and low, brown, rocky hills. There 
was a wind and it snapped thin 
clouds of dust up into the thin 
blue sky. Dust spattered at the car 
windows, along with swarms of 
suicidal green gnats. 

He found the sideroad that led 
to the chateau and turned onto it. 
Gradually a forest grew up around 
him. When the road finally dead- 
ended against a high stone wall 
there seemed to be tall, tangled 
trees everywhere behind him. 

Dave went over his map again 
and then gathered up his cameras 
and his stun pistol and got out of 
the car. It was a step up in the or- 
ganization to be chosen for a non- 
sitting assignment like this. Even 
so, Dave felt uneasy. You couldn’t 
tell how realistic things might get 
in a mock rescue. 

The narrow break in the wall was 
where it was supposed to be. Dave 
shoved his gear through and then 
edged through himself. 

There was the chateau. A large 
yellowstone building, some thirty 
yards from where he stood. Dave 
uncased a camera and took a few 
steps toward the place. 

Something showed at a second 
floor window. Something white was 
being waved.

•‘Don’t surrender till I get a few 
pictures,” Dave called. 

A girl’s voice called something 
back and then the white was gone. 
A moment later a ground floor side 
door opened and a slim blonde girl 
ran from the chateau waving a large 
white sheet of paper. “ . can for- 
get it,” she was saying. 

Dave hurried toward her. “Since 
I’m alone you’ll have to take some 
of the pictures when I tangle with 
the guards. Where are they any- 
way?” 

“They got upset and took off,” 
the girl said. “You are the man from 
the Press-Guardian , aren’t you?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well,” the girl said, “then you 
should have seen this. I was just 
packing when 1 glanced out and saw 
you sneaking up.” What she was 
holding was a copy of the Press- 
Guardian. 

“Today’s?” asked Dave, taking it. 
“I haven’t seen it yet.” 

“A runner brought it just awhile 
ago. 1 don’t imagine Commander 
Vetterlein can be too happy.” 

Swallowing, Dave made himself 
look at the front page. The head- 
line read: Plexus Plans Frameup! 
Then the subheads: News Magnate 
Linked With Crooked Food Com- 
pany In Move To Smear Batson! 
Press-Guardian Refuses To Play Ball 
And Tells All! 

The accompanying stories were 
more of the same. “He even threw 
out all the comics,” said Dave, 
leafing through the paper. “But left 
my name on the masthead.” 

“He?” 



“Howey-632,” mumbled Dave. 
Howey really was a good newsman. 
In his few hours as acting editor 
he’d gone out and dug up the whole 
story about the setup in Territory 
Eight. It probably didn’t take that 
much digging. Dave knew most of 
what Howey had used in his ex- 
pose. He just hadn’t been able to 
use it in print. “You see, they de- 
livered the wrong android to take 
my place.” 

“Can you explain while 1 pack?” 
asked the girl. “I don’t feel like 
staying on at the chateau now. I 
told my father this whole foolish- 
ness just couldn’t be made to work. 
He and the commander cooked it 
up — and so it had to be tried.” 
“You are Patricia Haysen, then?” 
“Why else would 1 be involved 
in this mishmash? Come on!” 

They went into the chateau and 
Dave explained to her just exactly 
how Howey-632 had ruined his 
career for him. 

B rown fog began to fill in the 
spaces between the clumps of 
trees. Patricia Haysen made herself 
more compact on the car seat and 
said, “I’m sorry none of the com- 
munications at the chateau were 
connected. My father didn’t think 
it was worth the expense since we’d 
only be using the place for a few 
days. Do you really want to call 
your paper?” 

Dave slowed the car as the 
weather thickened. “Eventually. If 
only to tell them what to do with the 
stuff in my desk.” 

“Maybe Commander Vetterlein 



IF 




will forgive,” began the girl. “No. 
He’s not likely to, is he?” 

“Nope.” 

“You’re sure you don’t want to 
head back to your own territory 
tonight? You don’t have to transport 
me home.” 

“I want to postpone the trip until 
tomorrow,” said Dave. “By now 
somebody must have stopped 
Howey-632.” 

“Of course.” said Patricia. “You 
can count on the commander.” 

“I was trying to hold onto this 
job with the Press-Guardian ” 

“Don’t apologize for not telling 
the truth in the paper. You’d have 
been stopped anyway.” 

“I hate to think of an android 
having more nerve than me.” 

“They build some of them that 
way,” said the girl. She bobbed up 
suddenly. “That’s no fog there!” 

Dave braked. About 100 feet 
ahead of them was a black truck, 
swung across the road. Five uni- 
formed men were standing in front 
of it, casually aiming blaster rifles 
down the road. “Would those guys 
be some of Leopoldo Batson’s 
troops?” 

“Now that you mention it,” said 
Patricia, “that short man with the 
curly gray hair is Leopoldo Batson 
himself.” 

“The range of those rifles is two 
to three hundred feet. I guess we’d 
better surrender.” He killed the 
motor. 

“Want to take some pictures of 
them first?” 

Dave frowned at her and stepped 
out of the car. “Good evening.” 



“Name, please?” asked one of the 
approaching men. 

“I’m Dave Romero from Terri- 
tory Eight.” 

Batson clapped his hands together 
and laughed. “My friend!” he came 
running for Dave. “A man of great 
courage.” 

W hile Batson embraced him 
Dave said, “You were ex- 
pecting me?” 

“Yes,” said Batson. “We learned 
that you were registered at the 
Esperanza Inn and after we read 
today’s Press-Guardian we knew you 
had come here to our territory for 
but one purpose. Am I right?” 
“Well, yes,” said Dave, watching 
Patricia climb to the road. 

“How were you able to wrest 
control away from Commander Vet- 
terlein? Will you continue?” 

“I hope so.” 

“Enough talk,” said Batson. “We 
came to the inn with an invitation 
for you. You had not arrived and 
we set out to watch the roads for 
some sign of you.” His head jerked. 
“Who is that girl?” 

“I’m Patricia Haysen. You know 
me, don’t you, Mr. Batson?” 

“I know your corrupt father.” 
“Miss Haysen,” said Dave, “Miss 
Haysen provided me with a great 
deal of information. She’s on our 
side, Batson.” 

“Coming from the heroic editor 
of the Press-Guardian that’s recom- 
mendation enough,” said Batson, em- 
bracing them both. 

“What sort of invitation did you 
have in mind?” asked Dave.

“I know you’ll want to cover it,” 
said Batson. “We have at last ob- 
tained accurate information con- 
cerning the Plexus Food Enterprises 
manipulations of the surplus food 
supplies. We have found the actual 
locations of the hidden warehouses 
where the food is really kept before 
it is sold secretly to wholesalers 
in other territories.” 

“The stuff didn’t spoil then?” 
“No,” said Batson. “Plexus jug- 
gled books and records to make it 
look that way. A good scheme for 
selling the same goods twice, once 
to the government and once to pri- 
vate parties.” He clasped Dave’s arm. 
“So I invite you to accompany us 
on tonight’s raid.” 

“Tonight?” said Dave. “Right 
now?” 

“We strike at midnight,” said 
Batson. “You should get enough 
material for a whole edition. Plus 
pictures.” 

Dave nodded finally. “Okay.” He 
looked toward Patricia. 

“I’ll come along, too, if I may,” 
she said. 

“You’re on our side now,” said 
Batson. “You’re welcome.” 

Batson embraced them both and 
then they started off on the raid. 

T he office of the Press-Guardian 
was quiet. It was early morning 
and Dave stood in the doorway with 
the still, blue morning behind him. 

“BOckman?” he said. He waited 
and then entered and crossed to his 
desk. 

Sitting on top of it, under a half- 
empty box of cigars, was a copy of 



yesterday’s paper. Dave had spent 
all yesterday afternoon and evening 
driving back and he had again not 
seen the Press-Guardian at all. He 
lifted aside Howey-632’s cigars and 
looked down at the front page. As he 
had expected all the expose was re- 
tracted and a sabotage plot charged 
against Batson and his followers. 
There was no mention of Howey- 
632. 

Dave walked back to the cloak 
room and peered in. The crate was 
there with the lid on but not nailed 
shtit. Dave lifted it and then let it 
drop. Howey-632 had been disman- 
tled and tossed into the excelsior and 
the lid jammed down to make the 
pieces fit. 

Dave went again to his desk. 
Bockman was just coming in to the 
office. “Hello, Merle.” 

Bockman said, “All is forgiven 
— in case you were worried.” 

“Oh?” 

“The commander called me per- 
sonally. He said now and then a 
mistake gets made, and this time 
someone in his organization slipped 
up and sent us a crusading editor 
from his private collection and not 
a new efficient model. A few firings 
were made and the incident is of- 
ficially over.” 

“That’s fine.” 

“It was a good issue I thought,” 
said Bockman. “Although I had to 
pretend that Howey-632 went ber- 
serk and locked me in the cloak 
room when I protested and that I 
didn’t get out until it was too late 
to stop the paper.” 

“Who dismantled him?”

IF 




“The commander sent over some 
guys.” Bockman lowered his head. 
“Have any trouble over in Nine?” 
“No,” said Dave. “I'm a hero 
over there because they think I put 
out that issue. I met Leopoldo Bat- 
son and went on a midnight raid 
with him.” 

“A raid?” 

“We found the warehouses where 
Plexus had stored the food supplies 
they’d swindled the government out 
of. Then yesterday morning I went 
along while some of the food was 
distributed. There really are a lot of 
hungry people over there.” 

“I figured,” said Bockman. “What 
about Haysen’s daughter? That’s the 
only problem that’s still bothering 
Commander Vetterlein. Her father 
called him and said she never came 
back from the chateau. Commander 
will be asking you about her.” 
“Patricia got fed up with her 



father. She’s on the other side now. 
I left her over in the capital yester- 
day.” 

Bockman put his hands in his 
pockets. “Shall we get going on the 
makeup? The Syndicate’s been out- 
doing itself on anti-Batson.” 

Dave took a cigar from the box. 
“Today’s issue is going to be devoted 
to the raid on the Plexus warehouses 
and to the famine. With text and 
pictures by your editor.” 

Bockman said, “And tomorrow’s 
paper?” 

“I imagine it will be another re- 
traction,” said Dave. “If possible I 
should be back in the capital of Ter- 
ritory Nine by sometime tonight.” 
He lit the cigar. “Before I go, 
though, I want to do an expose on 
my own. You can say I locked you 
in the cloakroom.” 

“To hell with that,” said Bock- 
man, “pass the cigars!” END

SMALL ONE 



by E' CLAYTON McCARTY 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



The creature from space 
was tiny but dangerous . 
In fact, it was a Man I 



I 

H e had taken refuge deep in a 
cavern when the fiery object 
sped across the horizon and drop- 
ped straight toward the center of 
his praying circle. He had watched 
it settle, its flames fusing rock and 
clay, watched the cherry red sur- 
face of the object turn gray as it 
cooled. 

Until then he had not thought of 
it as some kind of vehicle bearing 
a living being. Even when an open- 



ing appeared and a creature climbed 
to the ground his sensation was one 
of shocked inability to accept the 
picture his eyes held. He had never 
se^n a living thing so small. The 
creature was hardly larger than a 
branch from one of the desert 
shrubs that surrounded the praying 
circle. 

He lay in the cavern’s darkness, 
frozen in breathless rigidity, watch- 
ing with hypnotic fascination as the 
creature began to move about. He 
tried to still the excited quivering 



36 





of his muscles, lest some emanation 
from them might turn the visitor’s 
attention toward him; he had no 
way of knowing what senses the 
creature possessed. He was known 
among his Ceremonial Family as 
The Small One — not yet quite 
adolescent, and tiny for his age. He 
blinked hard and suppressed a 
whimper, fearful that he faced a 
problem much larger than he could 
be expected to handle alone. 

He could lie hidden in the cave’s 
darkness and yet see clearly every 
inch of the fantastic, arid landscape 
around his prayer circle through a 
narrow slit in the wall. This gradual- 
ly helped to quiet his racing blood. 
It was then that Small One began 
to sense waves of emotion flowing 
from the stranger. He thought. “This 
thing has a mind,” and found some 
of his fears draining away. 

He could begin to think, without 
too much apprehension, of trying 
to establish some means of com- 
municating with the alien being. 
But suddenly tension returned. The 
stranger had discovered his cave 
mouth and was moving toward it. 

F rantically Small One concen- 
trated upon learning why the 
creature seemed bent upon entering 
that black hole. But the alien mind 
was murky. Its thoughts took only 
vague shapes. Small One probed 
for signs of intended violence, but 
he found only curiosity, mingled 
with a confusion of half-formed 
ideas, among which was a primitive 
sort of wariness and cautious dis- 
trust of dark places. 

The stranger crept into the cave. 



Small One could hear the intruder 
stumbling about in the gloom. 

From the ledge upon which he 
lay, Small One could watch a rather 
incomplete exploration back about a 
hundred feet into the tunnel. By 
the manner of the visitor’s move- 
ment Small One realized that pos- 
sibly the creature possessed eyes 
that became blinded t by darkness. 
He seemed to have no secondary 
senses to compensate. The stranger 
came forward toward the light again, 
and Small One could see that wari- 
ness had slipped from him and 
could sense dimly that a feeling of 
shelter and safety had taken its 
place. He thought of letting the 
stranger know that his probing 
hands had passed near a Wist, but 
caution kept Small One lying hidden 
upon his ledge. He memorized 
carefully, however, the crevice in 
which the Wist lay, for when night’s 
cold swept away day’s blazing de- 
sert heat that Wist would lose its 
torpor. Then it would crawl about 
in search of flesh it might sting 
into a living-death paralysis and use 
as an incubator to receive and 
nourish its eggs. Before that time 
older members of The Small One’s 
Family must come and destroy the 
Wist. 

The stranger was moving again. 
He started to explore an area of 
the desert within sight of his ship, 
examining sparse plant life, stopping 
at intervals to survey at some 
length far-away features of land- 
scape through an object he held up 
before his eyes. Small One guessed 
it to be some mechanical means for 
increasing the creature’s powers of 



SMALL ONE 



37 




vision. On one circle back to his 
ship the visitor’s feet kicked into 
a pile of crystals. They were bright 
bits that The Small One found on 
occasions shining from stream beds 
or lying in the rubble of erosion on 
mesas beyond the great pine for- 
ests. The Small One had brought 
them with him to his vigil, for he 
was still very young. Even though 
he had embarked upon the first of 
the five ceremonial stages of Think- 
ing Alone, which were the steps 
from childhood to the wisdom of an 
adult, The Small One had felt afraid 
to sit in the loneliness of his prayer 
circle without companionship of his 
toys. He was ashamed now that 
this strange being had discovered 
his secret and would know how 
much of the baby still lurked within 
him. 

But the stranger seemed wildly 
excited by the discovery. He laid 
down a tube-like object which he 
had carried with great care all this 
time, scooped up a handful of 
crystals and rushed with them to 
relatively cooler air just inside the 
cave to examine them. He turned 
them over and over in his hands 
— ruby red ones, clear glass-like 
ones which scintillated with spark- 
ling brightness deep in their hearts 
even in the filtered light of the 
cavern month. 

Small One caught from the crea- 
ture’s mind sensations of tremen- 
dous satisfaction. There were vague 
images of richness, of yellow hair, 
of a pale throat around which a 
string of the crystals sparkled — 
pictures piling up kaleidoscopically, 
so fast that the patterns became 



confused and unrecognizable. But 
that evident joy over some silly toys 
caused The Small One to feel sud- 
denly a strong bond of kinship. The 
warmth of desiring understanding 
and friendliness crept into his mind. 
Impulsively he moved from his 
ledge. 

Small One was not prepared for 
such an explosion of terror as that 
which thundered from the stranger’s 
mind. The creature whirled, froze 
for an instant with face a twisted 
mask, then sprang backward toward 
the cavern’s darkness. 

T error lashed at The Small One 
like uncontrollable whips of 
energy. He sensed a fearsome image 
of himself — a gigantic head with 
blazing green eyes and saber-like 
teeth — flooding the stranger’s 
mind. He caught impressions of a 
desire to flee, of a wish for that 
metal tube which the stranger had 
laid upon the sands and forgotten 
in the excitement of finding his 
crystals, of a hopeless resignation 
to death. 

The ledge upon which The Small 
One had hidden was directly over 
the cave’s entrance. He sensed that 
the mere act of suddenly appearing 
between the stranger and that door- 
way enlarged the creature’s fright. 
To allay this fear The Small One 
stepped to one side and left the 
tunnel opening free. Yet the stranger 
continued to back farther into the 
cavern depths, wedging himself fi- 
nally in a crevice where he seemed 
to feel himself hidden by darkness. 

The Small One spent some mo- 
ments wishing he could have ad- 



38 



IF 




vanced through even one or two 
more of the stages of Thinking 
Alone, for he felt very young in 
the face of this problem. He had 
never known of a living thing on 
his world that experienced the ter- 
rible fear he saw in this creature 
huddled in the dark crevice. Per- 
haps the Wise Ones might have 
some understanding of it, but such 
insight would not belong to Small 
One until the fifth stage. 

He felt intuitively that this visi- 
tor from the skies possessed a de- 
gree of intelligence. He caught 
vague and completely alien impres- 
sions from that mind: the tube lying 
out on the sands would be used to 
kill Small One if opportunity pre- 
sented itself to possess it; much 
of the fear lying like a mist over 
the creature’s mind centered in cer- 
tainty that only moments stood be- 
tween it and death under the fangs 
of a wild beast hungering for food. 

The idea was so preposterous! 
The Small One would have laughed 
aloud if his thoughts had not been 
flooded with pity for the cowering 
creature. In his young way he hoped 
the stranger possessed intelligence 
of a degree high enough to allow 
some means of communication to 
be established between them. He 
built images of friendship, of peace- 
ful intention, of helpfulness, of frank 
curiosity . but faced finally a 
realization that the pathways through 
the creature’s mind were clouded. 
Any pictures that might find their 
way along them would be dim and 
possibly unrecognized. He tried then 
a visual presentation, holding his 
arms wide in the gesture of wel- 



coming a brother from another 
Ceremonial Family. When no re- 
sponse followed, he stood tall, in the 
aloof posture of a strange one wait- 
ing politely to be noticed and in- 
vited to confer. 

He went closer and repeated 
these rhythmic signs, but got no re- 
sponse. He began to feel completely 
helpless and childish in the face 
of this problem. He thought for a 
while of calling for his Family’s 
Tutor, but he was ashamed to con- 
fess that he might still be too young 
to have been sent out to his first 
stage of Thinking Alone. 

It occurred to Small One that the 
stranger’s eyes might be of a re- 
atively primitive type that could 
not receive impressions through 
darkness, and so he willed light to 
come into the cave. 

The creature’s wild scream at 
first clear sight of The Small One 
hurled itself far down passages, 
deep into the cavern in repeated 
waves of echoes. Small One had to 
close his own mind a moment to 
bring his senses back into harmony, 
for that cry sliced like a spear into 
his wide-open ears. He backed away 
from the crevice so that the stranger 
might not feel himself imprisoned 
there. Then he repeated again, for 
eyes that could now see, the cere- 
monial greetings he had used in 
darkness — the aloofness of one 
wishing to be noticed, the wide- 
opened arms of welcoming a bro- 
ther from another Family. But 
each movement seemed to drive the 
visitor into a wilder frenzy of fear 
emotions. 

The Small One probed and found 



40 



IF 




that his movements were being mis- 
interpreted as threats. He -held him- 
self still for a time, hoping to calm 
the stranger’s terror. He searched 

his own mind for some means by 
which he might establish communi- 
cation and reassure the creature. 

He wished with the self-pity of 
the very young, for that close, se- 
cure contact that only yesterday had 
bound his mind in complete unity 
with his Tutor’s. He wept inside, 

for he knew that his first step over 
the threshold toward the Coming 

of Age had severed that tie forever. 

Hphe Small One labored hard at 
his problem, but the only pos- 
sibility he could think of was to 
perform a ritual of ultimate friend- 
ship rarely used outside one’s Cere- 
monial Family, the Ritual of Trust 
— to lie on his back and wave his 
feet helplessly in the air, exposing 

his vulnerable belly. 

This he did, over and over, crawl- 
ing a little closer each time until 
he could almost feel the creature’s 
panting breath stir the air between 
them. He lay quiet then, hoping this 
being might eventually conquer fear 
and perform his own proper part of 
the ritual. 

It occurred to The Small One 
that an alien culture might not have 
instructed its members in proper 
responses to the ritual. So he invited 
the creature in pantomime, showing 
the routine of making a stabbing 
motion with empty hands to com- 
plete acknowledgement and accep- 
tance of proffered trust. He lay 
there patiently, repeating the panto- 
mime at intervals. In time The Small 



One sensed a lessening of the pound- 
ing force of fear waves between 
them and an alert wariness gradual- 
ly taking their place. 

The stranger began making noises 
— modulated sound which must be 
a language. Small One concentrated 
upon storing every syllable . in the 
memory area of his mind. There 
was a tune and a pattern: “You’re 
an ugly monster. You could tear me 
out of this crack without half try- 
ing. Why don’t you? What’s stopping 
you? What’s with this rolling over 
on your back like that? When my 
dog does that he’s either done some- 
thing he knows I’ll whip him for, 
or he wants his tummy scratched. Is 
that what you’re trying? Or do you 
figure on tricking me into coming 
out from behind this rock so you 
can snap me up without having to 
dig me out? I wouldn’t make a 
good-sized bite for you. You couldn’t 
even feel me go down that gullet 
of yours. If you weren’t so damned 
big I’d swear you were trying to 
make friends. Well, nothing doing, 
Pal; you won’t get me that way. 
I’m staying right here. It’s your 
move, Big Boy. What do you intend 
to do next?” 

Small One lay almost breathlessly 
still, fearful that any further ap- 
proach might destroy the tentative 
calm that had settled between them. 
Time’s pulse beat out the slow, 
monotonous rhythm of the first 
sun’s climb to its zenith and into 
the dawning of the red sun. Small 
One found his concentration weak- 
ening. It became increasingly diffi- 
cult to hold light within the cavern. 

And then a suffusion of joy pour- 



SMALl ONE 



41 




eci trom Small One’s neck glands, 
for the stranger stretched an arm 
out from his hiding place. 

Modulated sound again came 
from the creature’s mouth: “Wish I 
knew what was going around in 
that great big head of yours, Pal. 1 
can’t stand much more in this cre- 
vice; my feet won’t take it. You 
could get me anyhow. Might as 
well take a chance and come out. 
Get it over with. If you were as 
small as my dog I know what I’d 
do to that big tummy of yours. All 
right, Comrade, I’m coming out. 
Will that start your saliva glands 
working, or will it make your heart 
beat in anticipation of a kind word 

— like Shep’s? Your eyes just don’t 
look as liquid and loving as his. 
Wish I knew!” 

Then a foot edged from the 
crevice — and in a moment the 
creature stood outside. 

Small One did not dare turn his 
eyes to see better. He feared the 
thing might dart back into hiding 
at a movement even that impercep- 
tible. The thing took one more step 

— and another, until it stood close 
to The Small One. From the corn- 
ers of his eyes Small One saw the 
creature stretch on tip-toe, saw it 
reach upward toward his belly. But 
then, instead of an empty-handed 
stabbing motion which he expected 
as completion of the offer of Ulti- 
mate Friendship, Small One felt the 
stranger’s fingers scratching and 
patting. Modulated sound accom- 
panied the action: “There now, what 
do you say to that, old fellow? 
You’re a whale of a lot bigger than 
Shep, but I guess you must be 



somebody’s pet. How does that feel, 
Old Boy? Are we friends now?” 
But The Small One did not in- 
dulge himself too long in surprise 
reactions to any change this visitor 
had made in the ceremony. It was 
clear that the stranger had not been 
bred in a society which lived in 
accordance with civilized customs 
of The Ceremonial Families. Failure 
to complete the prescribed ritual 
properly meant, then, not boorish- 
ness but inheritance of a culture dif- 
ferent from that of The Families. 

The miracle of it struck Sma'l 
One with such impact that he 
to his full height, assumed the cac- 
monial pose and began to sing the 
song of Joyful Brotherhood. He sang 
for some moments before he reali- 
zed the mistake he had made. 

II 

T he stranger had sprung back into 
the rock crevice and clung there 
desperately, his body seemingly sha- 
ken by the waves of sound as ulu- 
lations reverberated like a roar- 
ing wind through the cavern. 

Contrite and worried, Small One 
ceased his song in the middle of a 
phrase and dropped quickly to his 
former position. Exhaustion grasped 
him with painfully probing fingers, 
tearing at muscles and mind. He felt 
helpless and sorry for himself. 
Abruptly he surrendered to the child 
that was still within him. He no 
longer could command enough con- 
centration to keep light in the cave. 
As darkness drained back into the 
area Small One could sense the 
heightening of that pitiful stranger’s 



42 



IF 




fears. And he was too tired and too 
inexperienced — and still too young 
— to alleviate them. 

It was not until almost time for 
the setting of the red sun that the 
stranger ventured again from his 
refuge. Small One had found in those 
tedious hours enough rest so that his 
power of concentration had been 
renewed, and he was able to will 
light back into the cavern. The 
alien seemed to possess no under- 
standing of why light had reappear- 
ed. The phenomenon sent the being 
on a series of movements about the 
cave. Small One was able to catch 
enough from the mist of that mind 
to know the creature’s movements 
were motivated by a search to find 
some explanation for the light 
source. 

Small One tried to project ' pic- 
tures of understanding but saw that 
these only seemed to cause distur- 
bance within the visitor’s mind 
rather than clarity. He sensed that 
these pictures seemed like hallucina- 
tions to the creature, attributed to 
some mental aberration brought 
about by the strangeness of environ- 
ment. 

So Small One ceased temporarily 
his attempts to communicate and 
contended himself with following 
the visitor about. But this was also a 
source of uneasiness. At frequent 
intervals the creature would stop 
and look at Small One and make 
modulated sound: “Are you stalk- 
ing me, Monster? Are you waiting 
for the right moment to pounce?” 

And Small One would lie on his 
back, repeating his offer of the 
Ritual of Trust, accepting graciously 



some rather timid scratchings and 
pats in lieu of the ceremonial Stab 
with empty hands. And the stranger 
formed vocal sounds almost con- 
tinuously, while he scratched Small 
One’s belly, while he searched for 
the light source — evidently a 
method of generating within himself 
courage and a will to carry on. The 
sounds followed a pattern: “You 
act like you’re tame, but maybe you 
just aren’t hungry yet. Is that it, 
Monster? Are you keeping me in 
sight until the next meal time? If 
you’re somebody’s lap dog I’d hate to 
meet the master. He’d need a whole 
city lot just to do an about-face.” 

Small One stored these sounds in 
his memory so that later they might 
be given to the Wise One of his 
Family and perhaps deciphered. Pos- 
sibly it might eak*, a conference of 
the Wise Ones from all the Cere- 
monial Families before meanings 
could be found. Small One knew 
now that this alien thing produced 
brain pulses much like his own; he 
knew also that he was the first 
of his race ever to contact a living 
intelligence from another planet, a 
being developed out of a totally dif- 
ferent culture. Thoughts of the honor 
and glory that would come to his 
Family set his heart to pounding 
wild rhythms of excitement. 

The stranger’s random searching 
for the light source had now turned 
into a repeated figure that was grad- 
ually leading them along one wall 
toward the cave’s entrance. Syllables 
coming from the creature’s mouth 
were changing character, seemingly 
more organized and less like in- 
coherent responses to panic. “Look 



SMALL ONE 



43 




Shep — or Rover — or whatever 
they call you — don’t follow so 
close. I don’t like that big mouth 
of your hanging over my shoulder. 
If you’ll just not entertain any 
thoughts about making a meal out 
of me until I can maneuver around 
toward that entrance and get out- 
side to my blaster we won’t be on 
such unequal terms with each 
other.” 

A picture was formed. It came 
about probably because this crea- 
ture’s mind focused upon a material 
object which he visualized imagina- 
tively, but it produced a picture 
whose pulses passed into Small 
One’s mind — a dimly lit, flickering 
thing more shadow than photo- 
graphic, but clear enough for Small 
One to understand. The creature’s 
mind held an image of the little 
tube he had dropped by the heap 
of crystals, and desire for it played 
in ghost-like impressions across the 
picture. 

With no thought of possible con- 
sequences, and with child-like gen- 
erosity of the very young, Small 
One thought the tube into the 
stranger’s hands. 

I’ll he damned! I’ll be 
▼ V damned!” The syllables were 
symbolic of a dumfounded and 
completely incredulous state of 
mind; that much Small One could 
make out. 

The creature sat, because surprise 
seemed to have drawn strength 
from him. He stared at the tube. 
He turned it over and over. He re- 
peated the syllables of astonishment 
and shook his head and stared hard 



at Small One. Then his shoulder* 
straightened, and he rose with a 
confident manner utterly changed 
from the frightened watchfulness of 
just the moment before. 

The eyes looked directly at Small 
One, and sound came with a strong 
vocal quality. “Well, Comrade, the 
shoe’s on the other foot now. Can 
you comprehend that? Watch.” 

Small One saw the tube raised 
and pointed. A huge boulder across 
the cave suddenly disintegrated into 
a puff of pungent vapor. The voice 
rang triumphantly: “This puts rhe 
balance of power back in my h s! 
Do you understand that, Big Boy?” 
There was almost insolent ease in 
the way the stranger leaned against 
the rock wall; grim amusement in 
the new sounds coming from him. 
“Don’t know how this happened, 
Pal, but there’s evidently intelligence 
on this planet that’s solved the 
problem of teleportation. Looks 
like they’ve been keeping track of 
me. Looks like they just don’t want 
me to become a meal for you. So, 
Big Boy, watch your step! If you’re 
capable of understanding what you 
saw this blaster do to that boulder, 
you saw what will happen to you if 
you make one move I don’t like. 
Savvy, fellow?” 

Small One could sense glee in the 
stranger’s tones, and so in his child- 
like way was happy for the creature, 
glad that relief from fear had come 
to it. The visitor pushed boldly 
past and headed directly for the 
cave’s entrance and the late after- 
noon sunshine outside. 

Small One followed to the vehicle 
which had brought the visitor, and 



IF 




sat patiently on the sand while the 
creature entered and made vocal 
sounds to an instrument Small One 
judged to be some device for com- 
n* "-"'eating with others of the same 
kind. He caught snatches of the 
excited inflections: . looks like 

we’re on the point of finding a 
race with minds like our own, may- 
be more advanced . haven’t made 
themselves known yet . obviously 
friendly . rescued me from some 
kind of monster that’s sitting out- 
side the scouter right now . put 
my blaster right smack into my hand 
. won’t believe this, but they 
evidently did it by teleportation . 
safe now to bring the ship in . 
got us another Earth here, looks 
like!” 

S mall One saw the visitor return 
to the open hatch. He watched 
him lean against the doorway and 
listened to lazily confident sounds 
coming from the creature. “Still 
here, friend? You must have a lump 
of curiosity that’s as big as you are. 
Why don’t you trot off to the folks 
that own you and bring them back 
here to talk to me? How about that, 
fellow?” 

There was pleasant satisfaction in 
the visitor’s voice, and so Small One 
spent some moments trying to estab- 
lish the bond of Sharing of Hap- 
piness with the creature. It was 
a failure. He realized that as yet he 
could not seem to span the gulf 
that separated their minds. But a 
determination was growing within 
himself to bridge that gap. 

First he concentrated upon creat- 
ing within himself that Silent Mo- 



ment. He wanted to examine this 
urge to be the first of his world to 
establish satisfactory communication 
with beings from an unknown ball, 
whirling in its own tight orbit far 
out across the galaxy. He felt 
justly proud that the shadowed hand 
of Chance had chosen him out of his 
Family — and through him his Fam- 
ily, out of all the Families — to be- 
come the first one to receive this 
gift from space. 

He faced the alternatives: relin- 
quish this task to the Old Ones of 
the Families, or withhold knowledge 
of visitors from space until he, by 
himself, could appear before their 
councils and accept the plaudits 
from his world for the glory of his 
Family. He examined critically the 
impulses which were driving him 
toward handling the affair by him- 
self, fearful that the decision might 
be prompted by pride rationalized 
as usefulness to his Family and to 
his race. He prayed a moment for 
humility and truth. Then he settled 
down with a reasonably clear con- 
science to the tedious task of setting 
up communication channels between 
the alien and himself. 

Like the child that he was, he 
now felt confident enough to move 
the universes. He began with simple 
things, projecting into the stranger’s 
mind images of his Family, their 
homes, their artifacts, then alternated 
with more abstract pictures of 
friendly Knowledge-seeking. He 
could see, from certain physical re- 
sponses, that these visions were 
touching the edges of the stranger’s 
consciousness, but without meaning. 
Fragments of unrelated thoughts 



SMALL ONE 



45 




were intermingled like jackstraws. 
There was no order of memory 
storage. Small One’s probing dis- 
covered at moments logically ar- 
ranged sequences of thought and 
followed their lines gleefully — to 
find each time their tails drifting off 
into a limbo of jumbled impressions. 

Like the child that he was, Small 
One became discouraged and fret- 
ful. 

But those faint shadows of coming 
maturity, which had caused the 
Family Tutor to think him ready 
for the first step of Thinking Alone, 
held him tenaciously to his purpose. 
And so they faced each other 
through the twilight and the darken- 
ing purple of dusk, the stranger sit- 
ting in the open door of his vehicle, 
Small One squatting upon the fused 
sands of his ruined prayer circle. 
Brooding peace grew with the dim- 
ming of the three suns’ afterglow. 
Cooling desert air carried the sound 
of the distant songs of the Lhronos. 
The fluttering of their wings and 
scratching from their claws made 
the desert noisy with preparations 
for bedding down in the burrows in 
the giant cacti. 

P resently the stranger reached for 
a pouch of dried forage materi- 
al. He poured some of the chopped 
bits into a carved wooden receptacle, 
then struck a small fire, brought 
these bits to a glow and alternately 
inhaled and exhaled smoke from 
them. Small One sensed a relaxing of 
tensions in the mind he faced and 
increased the force with which he 
projected his pictures. 

Rewards came slowly at first, in 



the form of puzzled frowns upon 
the alien’s forehead. Conceivably 
they were unrecognized sensation 
caused by slow awakening of that 
dormant area of brain Small One 
was trying to reach. Small One 
could tell that his thought images 
were forming there now, fuzzy and 
distorted, but with increasing clarity 
and rapidity — almost as well- 
formed as those in the new-born 
ones reflected from the Mothers 
of the Ceremonial Families. Exactly 
when these pictures drew recognition 
from the stranger as attempts to 
communicate was not clear to Small 
One. His first inkling of it came 
with a repeated sound phrase that 
must signify incredulous astonish- 
ment: “I’ll be damned!” 

The creature sat frozen in the 
doorway of his vehicle and said it 
many times. The absorption of 
smoke into the respiratory system 
was forgotten, and the fire went out 
in the carved receptacle in his hand. 

Small One then began patiently 
to teach the stranger to form answer- 
ing pictures, as he had seen nurses 
do with infants of his Family. He 
recognized quickly that this being 
could not yet learn to reach into 
the minds of others for thought 
images lying there, nor project those 
of his own mind. This communica- 
tion, at least for some time, would 
leave the creature’s mind entirely 
passive, like the page upon which 
one wrote. Ideas with even a mini- 
mum of the abstract in them could 
not pass from one mind to the other 
unless some way were found to pic- 
ture fhe abstraction in terms of a 
concrete, physical object. There was 



46 



IF 





SMALL ONE 



47 



reason to doubt that this being 
would ever grasp the imagry of the 
abstract. 

But Small One did learn a great 
deal: This visitor was of a race 
called by themselves mankind; the 
home planet was in a solar system 
possessing only one yellow sun — 
which struck Small One as a dreary 
environment with a lack of variety 
which might account for the un- 
used portions of this man’s brain; 
he was one of a ship’s crew of ten 
involved in exploration of planets 
for possible colonization. 

Small One eventually managed 
to transmit a superficial understand- 
ing of the Ceremonial Family, some 
of its rituals, and the dedication of 
one’s self to the five stages of ex- 
ploration of the mind as prepara- 
tion for maturity. This last Small 
One could find no way to explain 
clearly — since he had only just 
embarked upon his first stage and 
was, consequently, in the position 
of a child who can hear the words 
of his elders but cannot understand 
them. Yet Small One found the 
skepticism and ridicule in the man’s 
mind gradually giving way to won- 
der. 

It was becoming less labor now to 
converse with this man. Relaxation 
and peaceful thinking flowed be- 
tween them, free and bright as star 
reflections in water. Excitement of 
discovery had brought the visitor 
down from his perch in the doorway 
of his vehicle. Caution was tossed 
aside. He dropped upon the sands 
beside Small One and lost himself in 
tracing figures and outlines to en- 
hance the fuzzy images he was able 



to form in his mind. Small One 
wanted to sing for the joy of it. 

He remembered the effect his 
voice had produced upon the visitor 
during that first meeting in the cave 
and suppressed the impulse. 

Ill 

N ight time’s chill became biting, 
but the pair were too absorbed 
to be aware of it. Not until after 
repeated warnings from Small One’s 
exploratory sense did he awaken to 
imminent danger. 

It was the Wist, held in a harm- 
less stupor by day’s heat, released 
when cold followed the vanishing 
suns across the land. Small One re- 
membered he had seen it in the 
depths of the cavern when the man’s 
exploring hands had passed near it, 
remembered his intention to call an 
adult of his Family to destroy it 
before nightfall. 

He sprang to his feet, feeling again 
the helplessness and insecurity of a 
child lost from his protecting home 
circle. He had never killed a Wist. 
No one of his age — from any of 
the Families — had ever dared at- 
tempt the feat. But now he knew 
he must try. There was no escape, 
for the Wist moved faster than any 
living thing upon his world. 

The man sensed desperation in 
Small One’s sudden leap and was on 
his feet . and then he saw the 
spider-like legs of the great predator, 
scrambling over a hillock into the 
prayer circle. He reached for his 
blaster — and realized he had left 
it lying in the doorway of his scout- 
er. He could never make it. 



48 



IF 




Small One was no longer aware 
of the man, not even of himself. He 
felt only the tearing pain of trying 
to force a concentration of energy 
greater than he had ever achieved. 
The Wist came at them across the 
circle, then slowed . and was 
suddenly miraculously crumpled up- 
on the sand with the spasms of 
death contorting its legs. 

Many long, slow moments passed 
before either one moved, the man 
held in a rigid grip of dumfounded 
reaction, Small One weak to the 
point of faintness from the tremen- 
dous channeling and focusing 
through his mind of every bit of 
energy his child’s body possessed. 
Finally the man stirred, first to re- 
cover the blaster from his scouter, 
and then to approach the dead Wist 
warily, blaster tube held ready. 

At length he turned toward Small 
One. “You — did this? You killed 
the thing?” 

Small One could catch the stran- 
ger’s meanings only from his in- 
credulous tones. There were no im- 
ages forming in the man’s mind — 
just emotional responses throughout 
the brain cells, flashing like the wild 
sparking of a multiple short circuit. 
Small One tried to reproduce a pic- 
ture of assent and explanation there, 
but all the connections laboriously 
built between them had broken down 
temporarily. “What weapon did you 
use? I couldn’t see it. What was it? 
Where is it?” 

Small One attempted again to 
project an answer into the man’s 
mind, and found its agitation was 
still too great. Hoping to calm the 
man, he sat deliberately with his 



back to the dead predator. After & 
time the man joined him, careful, 
however, to face the Wist. Small 
One then formed repeated patterns, 
trying in many ways to explain that 
he had thought death into the Wist. 

And finally, long after the last 
convulsive jerking had left those 
great spider-like legs, the man was 
able to tear his attention from that 
black heap of death. Night’s heavi- 
ness pressed upon the turbulence 
within him and leveled his mind 
gradually to quiet where pictures 
might again take shape, and he und- 
erstood Small One dimly. “You 
mean you did nothing to kill that 
horror lying over there except just 
the power of thought waves?” 

S mall One misunderstood the skep- 
ticism he found in the stranger’s 
mind. He felt humble and inade- 
quate because youth had allowed 
him to do no more than barely blot 
out the carnivore’s life. 

He tried constructing images 
through which the man could under- 
stand that adults of the Families 
would have performed the task more 
efficiently . since they could 
separate the atoms of any structure 
from each other, and cause them to 
lose all bonds which held them to- 
gether and to dart off as free par- 
ticles. He explained that they could 
also cause the atoms to travel in 
a group, as a flock of birds might, 
and be drawn together into their 
tightly organized form in some other 
place. 

At this point Small One found 
pictures in the other’s mind begin- 
ning to give way to disjointed worry 



SMAU ONE 



49 




patterns. The man rose and edged 
toward his citadel of steel. He re- 
sorted to modulated sound again, 
forgetting that Small One could not 
clearly catch ideas from it. “You 
mean just with the power of thought 
your race can cause the atoms which 
make up my body, or any other 
thing, to fly apart? And that I 
would cease to exist?” 

When he finally was able to probe 
the meanings of these syllables Small 
One, with pride for which he was 
immediately ashamed, projected an 
affirmative answer. 

He detected increasing wariness 
in the alien’s mind, and the next 
syllables were delivered slowly, with 
a cautious sound in their inflections. 
“You mean that any time someone 
rubs you the wrong way he’s gone 
— just like that! Kaput! On just a 
whim! It’s beginning to look to me 
like a fellow would be much safer 
playing Russian roulette than hav- 
ing you around.” 

Small One, after finding the man’s 
meanings, shaped images of his Fam- 
ily to show that only after passing 
through the fifth stage of Thinking 
Alone did such power come to his 
people — and that the fifth stage 
also brought control. He felt the 
man grasp this idea in a shadowy 
sort of way. Fear lessened, but a 
worried watchfulness remained. 

The man climbed to the doorway 
of his ship and turned to wave. “I’m 
just a little too shook up to talk any 
more tonight, Pal. Let’s get some 
sleep and finish it in daylight . 
And I hope that mind power of 
yours can’t penetrate steel.” The 
scouter’s door clanged shut. 



The first moment was one of dis- 
appointment for Small One. But the 
astounding fact remained: he had 
met a being from an alien world, 
and they had talked. 

A great weariness was settling 
upon him. It was time to rest, for 
excitement alone could not have 
overcome the tremendous energy 
drain the killing of the Wist had 
demanded. He stretched himself 
upon the sand and blissfully opened 
his ears to the hiss and roar and 
bursts of noise that constantly pass- 
ed through the universes from star 
to far off star. It was his rn>:sic. 
Presently he slept like a tired, happy 
child. 

M orning touched two beings 
whose minds were refreshed. 
Communication between them was 
easier, pictures sharper in the man’s 
mind. 

Much information flowed between 
them, but as the red sun rose to 
follow its more brilliant companion 
across the sky Small One found the 
man scanning the heavens with in- 
creasing frequency. Blank moments 
came into the visitor’s concentra- 
tion, and with them a tendency to 
lapse into his modulated sounds. 
“We’ll be seeing the big ship pretty 
soon, Pal. It ought to be just about 
ready to hit the outer atmosphere 
by now. Then you’ll be in the middle 
of a crowd, my friend!” * 

The man made frequent trips to 
the instruments through which he 
kept contact with his kind. And 
then there was a moment when he 
jumped from his scouter shouting: 
“Five minutes more, Big Boy! Look, 



50 



IP 




Pal, I almost forgot. I’ve got kind 
of used to your looks, but I don’t 
know what those buzzards will do 
when they first step out of that ship 
and see you looming up like a blast- 
ed nightmare. Let’s get you back 
into that cave until I can figure out 
a way to make them acquainted with 
you a little more gradually than I 
had to.” 

The meanings were caught with 
difficulty, for in excitement over 
imminent arrival of his comrades 
the man was again not using that 
area of his brain through which the 
two had achieved communication. 
Small One agreeably retired into the 
cave and found his ledge from where 
he could peer through the small 
crack and watch. 

In a few moments the ship ap- 
peared, sat on its tail of fire a 
second, touched down and cooled. 
Then its company was out and 
crowding about Small One’s man, 
with much exchange of their modu- 
lated sounds and exploring about 
the prayer circle. Finally Small One 
saw his man gesture toward the cave 
and start for it with his companions 
following. 

He knew they were coming to see 
him. He stepped out into the sun- 
shine, sending the newcomers 
thoughts of welcome. 

The entire group stopped as if 
moved by a common control. Small 
One saw their hands go unconscious- 
ly to blasters at their belts, felt 
shock pour from their minds. He 
looked, bewildered, at his man who 
was still advancing. 

“Don’t mind them,” the man was 
saying. “They’ll get used to you.” 



And he turned back to his com-' 
rades. “Come on, you bums! He 
won’t hurt you. He just looks like 
something out of a bad dream. He’s 
tame as a kitten. Tickle his tummy 
and he’s your friend for life. Roll 
over, fellow. Make believe you’re a 
nice doggie for the people — before 
they take out for tall timber.” 

Small One could catch the man’s 
meaning only from gestures ac- 
companying his words, but he gra- 
ciously complied, lying as still as 
possible while all the newcomers 
approached one by one to pat and 
scratch apprehensively, their vocal 
mechanisms producing syllables: 
“That’s a nice fellow! Good boy! 
There, there now, pal!” And Small 
One’s man laughed all the while, 
mocking their timidity. 

IV 

T he next few hours proved rath- 
er disconsolate for Small One. 
A bustling activity began among 
the visitors as soon as introductions 
had been completed. Small One 
found communion with his man re- 
duced to an extremely few fuzzy 
pictures, for constant vocal com- 
munication with his own kind seem- 
ed to cause the man to use only the 
more primitive areas of his brain. 
The man was involved in physical 
activity, helping his companions to 
unload materials from their ship. 

All the men made wide detours 
to avoid passing close to Small One, 
except one they called Doc. He 
stopped his work frequently to stare 
intently at Small One. Several times 
a certain pattern of modulated sound 



SMALL ONE 



51 




came from Doc. "I’m going to need 
a specimen for dissection.” 

Small One’s man was quick to 
answer each time. “Take it slow, 
Doc. This is evidently the intelligent 
race on the planet. They communi- 
cate by projecting images into your 
mind. I don’t know how far this 
telepathy thing goes, whether it 
involves an ability to read thoughts 
or not, but quit blabbing everything 
that comes into your mind until we 
know a little more about these crea- 
tures. It just might cause us to face 
a bad survival situation.” 

Later Small One’s man returned 
and they sat aside to attempt more 
exchange of knowledge. It became 
clear gradually that the man wished 
to see others from this planet, and 
Small One gleefully sent out the 
image of happy discovery toward 
the far-away minds of his Ceremon- 
ial Family. 

They came a little before the set- 
ting of the third sun. 

Small One, dreaming with youth- 
ful excitement about his part in 
this memorable event, was made 
aware of their arrival by sudden 
action on the part of the nine new- 
comers from the big ship, who drop- 
ped burdens and gathered into a 
tight group to stand uneasily with 
hands on blaster butts. Small One’s 
man came toward him and said, 
“Get us acquainted with your friends 
quick and easy, old fellow. Let them 
know we won’t hurt them unless 
they try something out of line. Hop 
to it, Boyf” 

Small One understood from inflec- 
tions what was wanted. He went and 
sat before the Wise One. Their 



minds locked, and Small One laid 
in the Elder’s mind a complete ac- 
count of the man’s arrival by a 
flaming vehicle, of the struggle to 
communicate, of mankind’s suscep- 
tibility to fear, of its curious weak- 
ness which forced dependence upon 
material aids for most of its adjust- 
ments to life. 

Small One became aware of his 
man’s voice: “Look, fellow! My out- 
fit’s getting pretty nervous with all 
that mob of nightmares sitting there 
staring — doing nothing. Let’s get 
these introductions on the road. 
Some of those tinhorn buddies of 
mine have itchy trigger fingers. This 
silence just doesn’t look good. Are 
you talking to your friends? We’d 
better have some action and noise 
right quick, before something hap- 
pens. Tell your pals to play doggie 
and roll over and make like they’re 
tame so we can all get acquainted. 
Tell them we won’t hurt them . 
if they act like good boys.” 

Understanding more from inflec- 
tion and pantomime than he could 
extract from the man’s mind, Small 
One tried to project a reassuring 
picture to the representative of man- 
kind. Then he opened his own mind 
to the Old One and explained the 
need for performing the Ritual of 
Trust with these strangers. He felt 
immediately the strong pulses of 
disapproval that surged from every 
member of his Family. From the Old 
One came sharp images of rebuke: 
“You are still a child and can, there- 
fore, be excused for straying from 
the proper use of Family Ritual. 
But as a child you must be bound 
again to your Tutor. You must 



52 



IF 




learn among other things that the 
Ritual of Trust is not lightly offered 
outside your own Family. These 
strangers are welcome. Perhaps we 
can learn from them; perhaps they 
can also learn from us. We shall 
make them welcome.” 

Small One tried to place pictures 
of these thoughts in his man’s mind 
and found the paths difficult to 
traverse. Interference was there, both 
from a partial closing of that sec- 
tion of brain Small One had labored 
so long to stimTflate, and from a con- 
fused self-pity the scolding had let 
loose in Small One’s own mind. 

Then the Family were rising to 
their full heights and advancing . 
and they began to sing the song of 
Joyful Brotherhood. 

T he thing happened suddenly, like 
an explosion. Small One heard 
his man shouting. He understood 
enough to recognize it as a warning: 
“Don’t do it! It’s their welcome! 
Don’t do it!” 

But the hiss of blasters was al- 
ready cutting through the cries, and 
members of the Family were dying. 

Small One knew what would come 
next. He sprang upon his man and 
bore him to the ground, sheltering 
him with his own body and the 
shield of his own mind. 

He tried at the same time to pro- 
ject his knowledge of this alien race 
to the bewildered survivors of his 
Family. “They are afraid! The broth- 
erhood song frightens them. Don’t 
hurt them — let my man explain to 
them.” 

But the Old One had thought 
death for them. 



SMALL ONE 




The nine from the Earth ship ex- 
isted only as particles lost among 
the multiple billions of such matter 
loose in the universe. Only the one 
man, crushed nearly to suffocation 
under the tremendous bulk of Small 
One, was left, gasping to inflate 
lungs pressed almost to collapse. 

Crying with helplessness, Small 
One lifted himself from the pros- 
trate body. He felt the Old One’s 
mind touch his. The image it car- 
ried was compelling. “This man 
must go with the others.” 

Small One cried out in his mind 
against it. “This man is not evil 
like his brothers!” He tried to form 
pictures of the moments of senti- 
ment that he had discovered in his 
man’s mind. He begged in the name 
of the Families’ reluctance to de- 
stroy intelligence. He pleaded in the 
name of the mercy which was so 
strongly imbedded in traditions of 
the Ceremonial Family, and for 
himself and the affection which he 
had developed for this alien thing. 
His man had taken no part in kill- 
ing! His man had called out to pre- 
vent it! 

Adults of the Family had now 
gathered, and they shut their minds 
to his while they consulted. Small 
One’s Tutor was there among them 
and impressions of great sadness 
and pity reached Small One from 
his mind. 

And finally the Old One left the 
circle to convey its decisions. “The 
man may live. He will be your 
charge so long as you desire his 
company. Your Tutor will instruct 
you in the powers you must have 
to restrict his movements. And 



whenever darkness covers our homes 
he must be caged.” 

Small One bowed in the Ritual of 
Gratefulness and Obedience, but 
shame clung heavily to his body and 
spread a mist before his eyes. This 
was the manner in which a favor 
was given to a child. He read in the 
compassionate eyes of his Tutor the 
story of his failure to be ready for 
the Five Steps into companionship 
with adults of the Families. 

He turned to the man and pre- 
sented the council’s decisions, but 
the creature was dazed, numbed by 
seeing his companions so suddenly 
become nothing. Small One cradled 
the man in his arms and followed 
with him after the Family to the 
valley of their homes. 

T here was no wild grief in the 
valley that night, for in this 
civilization of The Families mem- 
bers possessed the patience to soften 
sorrow into acceptance of inevit- 
ability. When Small One laid his 
man in the cage designated by the 
Old One and locked its door the 
volatile child’s part of his mind al- 
ready visioned the coming days of 
companionship. 

Clang of the door brought the 
man from his dazed stupor. He 
screamed at Small One, “What’s 
this all about? Why are you doing 
this? I killed nobody! I tried to 
stop them.” 

Small One sat beside the cage and 
throughout the slow pacing of twi- 
light across the world thought quiet- 
ness into the man’s resisting mind. 
And then he projected to the man 
thoughts of gladness for the reprieve 



54 



IF 




of life that the Family Council had 
seen fit to grant. 

The man seemed inconsolable. 
Over and over he said, “What’s to 
become of me? I can’t take that ship 
back to Earth alone. What am I 
going to do?” 

Small One caught hopelessness in 
words he could not understand. He 
thrust bright pictures into that dim 
area of his man’s brain, fighting to 
arouse it once more. He built visions 
of the two of them playing together 
in the gay abandonment of children. 
He recognized now that, besides 
grief for dead companions, the man 
worried about his own future. And 
so Small One explained the Old 
One’s decision minutely, projecting 
images of toys, of the pet Vakrun 
frisking and nuzzling around them, 
then a picture of the Vakrun and 
the man together, sheltered one in 
each arm of Small One. Then he 
made pictures of safety, security and 
the fun of playing together — the 
Small One and his two pets. 

And then the man was pounding 
the bars of his cage with fists that 
quickly became bloody, screaming, 
“I am not an animal! Let me out of 
this! I am not an animal!” 

The tumult brought the Old One. 
He thought the man into calmness 
and to oblivion of sleep, and then 
he stood looking down at Small 
One, shaking his shaggy head sadly. 
Small One felt shame. Apprehension 
for his man’s future swirled like a 
black fog through his mind. 

Morning found the man dead. He 
was hanging from a noose of his 
own fashioning from the bars of his 
cage. 



Adults of the Ceremonial Family 
came to stand beside Small One and 
look with him at the pitiful thing, 
and their minds drew together into 
council. The Wise One read the 
patterns of that dead brain and 
spread their meanings out for the 
council to see: “This creature be- 
longs to a race which cannot accept 
inferiority. It must either feel sup- 
erior or perish. If it cannot achieve 
superiority through the mind it in- 
vents instruments of power to hold 
others in subjection to it. This is 
a race like the one which devasted 
our galaxy in the days of the pass- 
ing of the Dark Star through our 
suns. And now that this man has 
found his way into space there will 
be more to follow. There will come 
another time of blackness — unless 
we can seek them out and destroy 
them before they infect the galaxy.” 

Involuntarily Small One exclaimed 
aloud against this, for it did not fit 
into what he had been taught about 
the Ceremonial Families. Nowhere 
did it reflect the tolerance and 
peace and hatred of violence which 
showed through every ritual he had 
been taught to perform. At a nod 
from the Old One the Tutor led 
Small One away to a quiet place 
and tried to show him by analogy 
with the Wist that evil forces must 
be eliminated before the bright sun 
of kindness could shine without 
clouds to mar it. 

Eventually Small One was left 
alone with his grief, the contra- 
dictions of adult thinking still un- 
resolved in him. He knew that his 
people would go out to the empty 
ship, and that an examination of 



SMALL ONE 



55 




maps therein and of memory force 
impressed upon the atoms of their 
steel hulls would betray Earth’s lo- 
cation. 

Impulse said those ships must be 
destroyed before they were made 
to give up their secret, so that 
death would not rain down upon 
the innocent and unsuspecting world 
of his man. And the child in Small 
One leaped to the impulse. 

D riven by a love for mankind, 
transferred through the love 
for his man, he hurried over the 
mountain pass and out on the desert 
toward his praying circle. And the 
child in him cried because he was 
not yet old enough to be able to 
separate those ships into their par- 
ticles and lose their identities among 
the whirling motes of matter. 

In his mind there was only the 
pit of the fire death to serve. Like 
a festering sore in the valley of 
volcanic cones which lay at the des- 
ert’s edge was a pit filled with a 
yellow stuff belched from the depths 
of Small One’s world. Powdery after 
it cooled, it was violently corrosive, 
reducing most substances to dust, 
reproducing itself like a virus as 
long as a bit was left to feed upon. 

Small One had nothing adequate 
to carry the powder except some 
abandoned shells of the desert crawl- 
er which had a temporary resistance 
to its action. The crying was still in 
him as he carried two shells of the 
powder to the big ship and its little 
scouting brother. He leaned as far 
inside both hatchways as he could 
force his body and threw the pow- 



der, scattering it as widely over both 
interiors as he could, throwing the 
shells after the floating stuff. 

Then he sat in his prayer circle 
to watch through the hours, while 
the bright metal ships turned to piles 
of dust. 

And he cried with his child’s 
heart because these ships belonged 
to his man and would soon become, 
with their once proud passenger, an 
unrecognizable part of the soil of his 
world and a hurt-filled memory. 

And then he cried because insight 
told him that he had made it pos- 
sible for brothers of his man to find 
their way to this world some day, 
perhaps with the power to destroy 
his Family and his world. 

Then the first sharp stings on his 
hands told him that some of the 
yellow powder had touched his own 
flesh in spite of the care used in 
scattering it. 

He sat through the long twilight, 
through the evening songs of the 
Lhronos winging to safety of their 
night-time burrows, with the corro- 
sion slowly turning his own flesh 
to pulp, and he cried his child’s 
heart out over the inadequacy of his 
mind that chance had forced into 
monumental decisions too soon. He 
cried over the foolishness of all life 
which must by its nature spend so 
many of its brief moments of con- 
sciousness in the destruction of life 
— until some time in the star-burst 
of a glorious night the fiery dis- 
integration creeping slowly through 
his body finally touched the center 
of his own life, and the young voice 
fell silent forever. END

In the country of the blind, 
the one-eyed man is— doomed! 



by BASIL WELLS 



It was many centuries ago that 
the overcrowded spaceship made its 
final, clumsy, grounding on the 
planet of Croth. Only the oldest 
sagas, in story and song, deal brief- 
ly and carelessly with that original 
crash landing. What ensued con- 
cerned them — 

T he colonists must have number- 
ed close to three hundred. 
From the constant tales of feuding 
and ugly blood lettings in those 
early months and years we must 
assume they were banished malcon- 
tents. 

They built rude homes and started 
cultivating land not far from the 
landing place in two fertile, stream- 
watered valleys. With seeds and the 
few remaining head of livestock sur- 



viving the landing, they started 
building a humble version of Earth. 

A year later, perhaps less — for 
words and meanings and spoken 
fables change with each retelling — 
disaster had come upon them. 

The plague — the virus — the 
darkness — struck them all within 
a matter of hours. Whether it was 
something native to Croth, or a mu- 
tated strain carried from Earth, we 
do not know. Their vision dimmed, 
clouded over, and died. None had 
escaped. 

The twin valleys were populated 
by sightless humans and unseeing 
livestock. Only the intruders suffer- 
ed blindness — the native birds and 
beasts seemed untouched. 

The entrances to the twin valleys, 
five in all, were narrow and easily 



57 



blocked by walls of stone and earth. 
They had sealed themselves away 
from the rest of savage Croth and 
had learned to live in comparative 
peace and security. Their ears, their 
noses, and their fingers and toes 
swiftly adapted themselves. With the 
passage of centuries the very mean- 
ing of the words: “vision” or “sight” 
had become empty and the words 
describing color or shade, abandon- 
ed. 

The population had increased, re- 
markably until the valleys had be- 
come overcrowded. Then the outer 
walls were breached and palisades 
of stakes, later to be replaced with 
barriers of earth and stones, were 
pushed gradually outward along the 
downward course of the twin val- 
leys’ streams. Intervening hills and 
ridges broke into this ballooning 
outward thrust, and eventually a 
number of widely separated enclo- 
sures had resulted. 

Gates and earlier walls cut the 
enclosures into many sections. The 
contrast of the neatly cultivated 
patches within the dikes, against 
the green seas of forest and tall 
grasses, must have reminded one of 
the ancient battle of the Hollanders 
against the North Sea. 

Into this peaceful walled micro- 
cosm there eventually dropped a 
fatally wounded spaceship, a cargo 
ship burdened with electronic equip- 
ment, and replacements and repairs 
for mining mechs. The blowup of 
one of the ship’s two power kettles 
had killed all the crew save Dorby 
Cole, and Cole had, somehow, 
managed to crash land the shattered 
mass of metals and plastoids. 



The ship plowed into the rim of 
a broad green plain, ripping deeper 
as it went, until a ten-mile gouge 
ended just short of the wooded foot- 
hills of a Crothan mountain chain. 
A section of intact hull, complete 
with emergency space lock, thrust 
up through the tangled mass of tree 
roots and foliage of the prairie grove 
beneath which most of the ship lay 
buried. 

Less than a thousand feet from 
the little island of forest growth a 
roughly constructed wall of earth, 
topped with dressed stone and shar 
pened stakes, ran back toward lv. 
wooded hills. Twelve feet in height, 
at its minimum, and often much 
taller, it blocked the passage of 
Croth’s most destructive wild life. 
But it could not keep an active 
man with tools and ropes from pas- 
sage . 

B an Telar stopped for a moment 
to wipe the sweat from his 
face with the hairy back of his 
forearm. He stood erect, the great 
stake he carried resting on the turf 
and leaned against his shoulder. As 
he rested, two other workers carry- 
ing similar sharpened posts passed 
him. Mert Rodn and Hekl Yenn — 
his nostrils recognized them. His lips 
curled when the bestial stench of 
Mert Rodn’s unwashed body came 
to him. 

It was Mert Rodn who was his 
most formidable rival for the 
smooth-fleshed girl, Esala Rowan. 
Rodn was an older man, twice wid- 
owed, and a thick-muscled giant. 
Already he had crippled two other 
suitors for Esala’s hand, and Ban 



58 



IF 




Tekir had escaped only by his youth 
and nimbleness. So now Telar wait- 
ed a possible assault with the thick 
stake heid before him as a shield. 

The Warmth was above him, 
making his naked flesh wet and un- 
pleasant, and attracting the tiny 
winged midges that swarm and sting. 
The breeze came from beyond the 
Wall, bearing with it an alien odor 
that was unpleasant and acrid and 
like burnt metal. He heard branches 
and leaves wrestling together, and 
the beat of feathered wings, and the 
rasp of armored insect legs and ex- 
oskeletons in the thick prairie grass 
of this newly reclaimed field. 

“Ho, weakling!” challenged Mert 
Rodn from further along the path. 
“Must you rest with every other 
step? A fine mate for Esala you 
would make!” 

So! The big man was not going to 
attack while Hekl Yenn, and others, 
might be within hearing range. He 
must be planning to catch him 
apart from the others. Telar shoul- 
dered his burden and started on 
again. 

“The Warmth is not yet over- 
head,” taunted Rodn, “and you are 
wearied. Before the Cold comes 
again we will drag your weakling 
body back to the village.” 

“It is not I who will be dragged* 
Mert Rodn,” said Ban Telar. “As 
the Warmth grows so does my 
strength. But the Warmth lessens 
your strength. You are old and stiff, 
Rodn, unfit to father more chil- 
dren.” 

Rodn growled something angrily 
and Hekl Yenn answered doubtfully. 
He could not catch the words, but 



immediately afterward his ears warn- 
ed of something unusual. And then 
his nose scented a stranger, possibly 
a visitor from some distant sector 
of the Wall. Momentarily he forgot 
the two workers directly in front of 
him. 

That moment’s inattention allow- 
ed them to put down their heavy 
posts and launch themselves back 
at him. He flung the barrier of the 
heavy stake in their direction, and 
backed away in a quick shuffle in- 
to the unknown terrain alongside 
the path. But Yenn and Rodn came 
after him, from either side, his 
startled heartbeats and his breathing 
their guides. Yenn’s slender fingers 
wrapped around his throat, and 
Rodn’s wide palms and thick fingers 
bit into Ban Telar’s shoulder and 
upper arm. 

R odn began mauling him. He was 
deliberate and merciless. He did 
not wish to kill Ban Telar for the 
penalty for murder was severe — 
the loss of both ears and the nose 
and life-long slavery. He wished only 
to cripple Ban Telar so lithe-limbed 
Esala Rowan would shudder to 
touch him again. 

A forearm snapped. Telar clench- 
ed his teeth on the agony of his 
cracked ribs and his battered jaws 
and skull. If he could only twist 
free and run. Even into the unknown 
stretch of prairie away from the 
path . And his other arm popped 
as Rodn exerted his great strength. 

Would Rodn ever have done with 
him? Was he not hurt enough as it 
was? Yet he knew that Rodn wanted 
his back to be twisted. 



MIND ALLEY 



59 




A strange voice, speaking strange 
angry words, was beside them. He 
heard no sound of blows; yet the 
hands of both Hekl Yenn and Mert 
Rodn fell away limply. There was 
only a slight spppt of sound, and an 
alien scent. 

The hands of the stranger were 
upon him, working with the broken 
arms. He felt the bones grate and 
there was the sound of quick axe 
strokes, and then the pressure of 
wooden splints and stiff bindings 
holding them in place. 

In spite of the pain he was aware 
of the approach of other workers 
in this new sector. They ranged 
themselves about the fallen men 
and about him and the stranger. He 
made their number between seven 
and twelve, the confusion and the 
alien scents making him uncertain. 

“Why did you and this stranger 
kill Mert Rodn and Hekl Yenn?” 
demanded one of the workers, Aret 
Pol. 

“They are not dead,” Doln 
Perse’s reedy voice cried. 

“Then what have you done with 
them? And who is this stranger who 
speaks gibberish? Is he a madman?” 

“He saved me from a beating by 
the two of them,” Ban Telar said 
weakly. “I do not know his name or 
his sector along the Wall. He has 
not the scent of our people, nor the 
words of our- village.” 

“Can there be villages and sec- 
tors of the Wall that we know noth- 
ing of?” the workers questioned. “Or 
are there Walls built beyond our 
Wall? Let us arrest this strange 
man.” 

There was a confusion and the 



stranger mouthed harsh words, after 
which the spppt sound came and the 
workers fell silent. And then the 
stranger slung Ban Telar’s body over 
his shoulders and headed toward 
the Wall. 

That they climbed a rude ladder 
of lashed poles and descended on 
the further side in a similar fash- 
ion, Ban Telar knew. It was in his 
mind that this must be a worker 
from another Wall that lay beyond 
their own. Such an intriguing theory 
was often bandied about by the very 
young and the very old. The unintel- 
ligible words and the mysterious wea- 
pon would seem to bear this out. 

He was carried into the coolness 
of a grove of trees, and the alien 
scorched metallic smell grew over- 
powering and almost sickening. 
Then a door clanged hollowly and 
they went down into an amazing 
blend of odors and sounds and 
brokenness. The stranger laid him 
on a firm, yet springy, surface and 
shortly he felt a pricking in his 
arm. 

Afterward he fell asleep. 

B an Telar put aside the helmet 
that linked with the edutapes 
the spaceman, Dorby Cole, had 
chosen for him. A month of grow- 
ing friendship and cultural exchange 
had passed since first they met. Now 
Ban Telar knew that Cole had 
come from another world, and that 
only a fraction of this world of 
Croth was occupied by his people. 
The concepts of an earth, freely 
floating in space, and of huge 
warmths, or suns, no longer seemed 
so strange to Ban Telar. 



60 



IP 




A week since, Cole had put the 
mentrol hood down over Ban Telar’s 
skull, and as the thousands of tiny 
electrodes contacted his brain he had 
seen through the eyes of the ship’s 
one remaining controlled robot. He 
had seen the green vegetation and 
the pale-blue sky and the silvery- 
redness of air, and gaily plated liz- 
ards darting among the trees. Out 
on the plains he had seen vast seas 
of four-legged beasts of many strange 
shapes and sizes, feeding and run- 
ning and feeding again. 

And he knew now that it was the 
robot, the super mech controlled by 
Dorby Cole’s brain, that had 
crossed the wall and rescued him. 

“I needed to make contact with 
your people,” Cole had explained, 
“so I have kidnapped you.” 

Ban Telar did not resent his priv- 
ileged-prisoner role. But for the 
stranger he would now be a pain- 
wracked bundle of broken bones 
and swollen flesh. It was the being 
away from Esala that hurt him the 
most. In his absence she might yield 
to Mert Rodn’s offer of marriage. 
For Rodn did own three houses 
and a dozen fields. 

“I have finished with the edu- 
tapes, Dorby Cole,” he said as the 
Earthman entered the cabin. 

“Good,” Cole said. He came 
closer. “Let me fit this headband 
over your ears and forehead . 
So!” 

There was a firm, though soft, 
pressure against Telar’s flesh. He 
heard a click and then a building 
hum. A weird swirling of grayness 
faded and he began to see a faint 
picture. It was like the pictures he 



had experienced under the mentrol 
hood while he controlled the super 
mech. 

Cole adjusted unseen knobs, and 
the pictures were suddenly sharp 
and clear. 

“There!” he cried out. “I can see! 
As though I rode within the robot 
— or controlled it.” 

“Since you have no eyes,” said 
Cole, “I decided you could use 
some. No need for twin mentrols 
and a super mech. This allows you 
to see as well or better than my- 
self.” 

“This is wonderful, Dorby Cole.” 
“A trifle selfish too, Ban Telar. 
From what you tell me of the an- 
cient myths and songs I too can ex- 
pect blindness before many months. 
If you can see — so can I.” 

“The sickness may have passed.” 
Telar shrugged. “But if not I can 
teach you how to live among us. 
Even if the band fails you it is not 
hard to live within the Wall.” 

Cole was a chunky youngish man, 
red-haired and gray-eyed, his face 
fair and freckled. Now his skin 
flushed and his eyes were hot. 

“For you, perhaps, it is easy. But 
I cannot smell, or hear. I would be 
in the way and helpless. These sec- 
ond eyes must work, Ban Telar.” 
“They give me an odd feeling,” 
Ban Telar said, stumbling as he 
tried to walk across the cabin’s 
buckled deck. “Already there is an 
ache in my skull and I feel sickness 
in the pit of my stomach . But 1 
can see perfectly.” 

“It may take weeks to learn their 
proper use, Ban Telar. You will be 
like an infant learning to walk. But 



BLIND ALLEY 



61 




in the end you will feel lost without 
your second eyes.” 

Telar’s skull was splitting with 
headache. He slipped off the band, 
welcoming the darkness and the fa- 
miliar smells and sounds. Perhaps, 
he thought, the gift of vision was 
not the wonderful thing that he 
had first imagined. Yet, even as he 
doubted, he was impatient to get 
outside and explore the broad con- 
tinents and islands of Croth’s one 
vast sea. 

O ut of the wreckage of the giant 
freighter Dorby Cole and Ban 
Telar had extracted the damaged 
amphibious skimmer, and repaired 
it. At first Ban Telar worked by 
controlling the super mech, but as 
his arms healed he used the huge 
robot less and less. And gradually 
he came to use the Eyes for longer 
periods until he took them off only 
to sleep or to work in darkness. 

The skimmer was fueled and 
ready for the globe-circling prelim- 
inary hop. But before it left Ban 
Telar asked to be permitted to visit 
Esala Rowan. And, being in the 
hottest season of the year on Croth, 
he chose the period of Warmth that 
Earthmen call midday. At this time 
most of the workers and women of 
the villages within the Wall were 
sleeping. Only with the Cold’s wel- 
come, at nightfall, would children 
and adults again be about. 

He took with him another of the 
dozen Eyes that the Earthman had 
fashioned from the electronic and 
mech parts of the ship’s cargo. Per- 
haps if Esala Rowan could see as 
he saw she would consent to mate 



with him . And together they 
could teach the People the use of 
other Eyes. 

Within the WalPs confines i! : 
Eyes changed the whole character 
of the world he had known. He saw 
that the huts of brick and plastered 
mud were misshapen and a mad 
blend of colors and plasterings. The 
paths wandered across the plots of 
land, almost touching at times. He 
saw the naked brown bodies of men 
and women sleeping under the trees 
and inside the huts, and the sight- 
less pygmy cattle, huge-uddered and 
leopard-spotted, in the fields. He 
saw a small boy, alone, slipping 
from a hut to play in the empty 
fields and woods. 

He had stolen away, many times, 
in years gone by, to go on similar 
boyish explorations into the un- 
known. 

Esala Rowan lived with her 
wrinkled old mother, Efa, in a hut 
on the village’s outer circle of dwel- 
lings. Efa was a widow who never 
tired of extolling the wealth of 
Mert Rodn. And now Ban Telar 
could see how near to collapse was 
the mean little hovel of mud and 
thatch. 

Esala slept close to the mat-barred 
doorway — her mother in a further 
corner. He whispered softly her 
name, and Esala’s pale golden face 
and fair hair appeared. But for the 
sunken eye sockets she was as beau- 
tiful as the women in the Earth- 
man’s books and tapes. 

Her nostrils dilated. She put 
both arms around his neck. 

“Ban!” she whispered, “Ban 
Telar!” 



62 



IF 




“I did not want you to think I 
was dead, Esala.” 

“I knew you were not. They 
said the stranger killed and ate you 
after he stung the workers. There 
were many stories. Some said that 
Mert Rodn hired the stranger to 
carry you off.” 

Ban Telar laughed. “Then you 
have not mated with Mert Rodn as 
your mother wished?” 

“Never. He thinks to win me by 
crippling his rivals. Let the whole 
village be crippled — yet I will not 
mate with him. And my mother 
. She is dead these past nine 
Warmths.” 

“Then come with me, Esala, to 
live with the Earthman. We will 
travel far and see many strange 
lands.” 

“You use strange words. What is 
see? And we must mate only if 
the Old Ones bless us . We must 
not leave the village, either. You 
were wrong to do so.” 

Ban Telar slipped the Space Eyes 
over Esala’s head and adjusted the 
controls. He felt her shrinking with- 
in his arms and then a cry of fear 
sounded. Faint though it was he 
covered her lips with his palm. 

“This is seeing, Esala. The Earth- 
man gave this gift to many of our 
people. After we have been blessed 
by the Old Ones and are mates I 
will take you to him.” 

Esala was pawing the headband 
from her forehead. 

“I am afraid,” she said, when he 
took his hand away. “There is evil 
in this thing. There is flashing like 
pain that hurts not and strange 
things. Put it away.” 



B an Telar shrugged. He stowed 
the Eyes inside the knapsack 
he carried and took Esala’s trem- 
bling hand again. 

“Come along,” he said, “to the 
Old Ones’ house.” 

“But they sleep,” objected Esala. 
“We will awaken them. We have 
waited too long to mate. We wifl 
wait no longer.” 

As they walked together down the 
empty narrowness of the street Ban 
Telar was astonished by the dif- 
ferences that vision brought. The 
crooked walls, sagging and twisted, 
with their unequally textured walls 
and warped door frames. The 
crudeness of the furniture that the 
blind artisans of the village con- 
structed so sturdily — and usually, 
lopsidedly. 

Finally they arrived at the an- 
cient, and larger, buildings where 
the childless and feeble-bodied old 
men and women were housed. This 
was the governing body of the vil- 
lage, and few among the workers 
disputed them . Some day they 
too might be left homeless and 
helpless. And then they would be 
the Old Ones. Let the Old Ones 
make the laws. Bless the Old Ones. 
We too shall grow old. 

“Awaken, oh Old Ones,” Ban 
Telar cried. “Esala Rowan and Ban 
Telar ask your blessing on their 
mating.” 

There was a rustling and husky 
whispering within the main room 
of the dwelling and the odor of 
ancient flesh and long-worn blan- 
kets of wool and vegetable fibers. 
With his Eyes Ban Telar saw more 
than a score of ancients, most of

them huddling their wrinkled, an- 
cient bodies in coarsely woven blan- 
kets despite the noonday heat. 

“You have been gone from the 
village many Warmths and many 
Colds,” a quavering old voice, Polg 
Rian’s, charged. 

“I was taken away by the Earth- 
man until my arms were healed,” 
Ban Telar said. 

“It is against the laws for you to 
leave the village without our per- 
mission,” the old voice said. “For 
this you are to have twenty blows 
of a staff across your back. And 
for a hundred Warmths and Colds 
you are to wear chains.” 

Ban Telar’s right hand dropped 
down to the stitcher holstered at his 
hip. He had scoffed at Cole’s insis- 
tence that he take it, but now he 
was glad. The nip of one or two of 
the paralyn-tipped needles in the 
weapon’s magazine could paralyze 
the strongest man. 

“I have returned with a gift from 
the Earth our people left years ago,” 
he cried, backing away a step or so. 
“With it you can see again.” 

“Ban Telar is crazed,” the old 
man said. “He babbles of fantas- 
ies. He knows nothing of sight. 
Only we Old Ones know. Seize 
him.” 

B y this time the noise had 
aroused' other villagers, and 
among them, black-bearded and 
thick-bodied as a gorilla, moved 
Mert Rodn. His broad nostrils quiv- 
ered and his teeth bared as he scent- 
ed Ban Telar and Esala Rowan. He 
elbowed through the crowd. 

“Let me set my hands on Ban 



Telar,” he raged, and Ban Telak 
saw his big hand go down to the 
sheathed knife at his hip. 

Ban Telar tried once more to be 
heard. 

“I speak only the truth,” he said. 
“We are of the same race as the 
stranger. But his people can see, 
as we once could. With Eyes we 
can go beyond the Wall. We can 
see the stars and the sun.” 

“Seize the madman,” cried all the 
Old Ones. “Seize him. Strike him 
down. Beat off his diseased head!” 

Ban Telar cleared the trimmer 
key of his weapon and started back- 
ing away, with Esala struggling to 
get free from his grasp. 

Dorby Cole had warned him that 
this might happen — that his own 
people would turn against him — 
but he had not believed. 

“Let me go, Ban Telar,” scream- 
ed Esala. “Do not take me to the 
devil from Earth. Do not torture me 
with the band about my head. Free 
me, demon!” 

Anger cut across the confusion 
within his brain. He would carry her 
off in spite of herself as Dorby Cole 
had done with him. He saw the 
workers closing in on him, ten or 
twelve of them, and more arriving. 
In flight alone could he best them 
once he had escaped that constrict- 
ing ring. 

His thumb depressed the firing 
stud of the stitcher, spewing needles 
in short bursts. Four of the men 
went down and he leaped through 
the gap. Esala was struggling and 
crying out, and the villagers were 
setting up a howl that was deafen- 
ing. The confusion was an aid, now,

for ears and noses could not dis- 
tinguish the location of either of 
them. 

He had gained the meadows and 
the carefully cultivated fields beyond 
the village before the Old Ones’ 
cries for silence and order were 
obeyed. Then the hastily armed men, 
forty or fifty of them he estimated, 
came padding silently after him. 
And in their front, his head low 
as he followed their scent spoor, 
came the hairy giant, Mert Rodn. 

“Put me down, Ban Telar,” beg- 
ged the girl. “Alone you can escape. 
Burdened as you are they will over- 
take you quickly.” 

“I will not leave you behind to 
mate with Mert Rodn,” Ban Telar 
told her as he left the path and 
took to the fields. 

“But I would wait for you,” she 
said. “Truly. I do love you. Throw 
away the Eyes. Take your punish- 
ment. When their anger has cooled 
we will mate.” 

Ban Telar paused briefly to study 
the pattern of naked, bronze-fleshed 
men, brandishing their crook-bladed 
metal knives and their clubs and 
spears. They stayed on the paths, 
in the main, but a small party of 
four, Mert Rodn in the lead, were 
sniffing out 'his trail. 

The ladders were less than two 
hundred feet distant now, and to 
the north. With his stitcher ready, 
and armed, he plunged directly 
toward them. Only once did he fire. 
A numbed worker went sagging to 
the path as he crossed it and then 
he was ascending the inner ladder to 
cross the Wall. 

One last look he took back with 



him into the enclosure as he turned 
to descend on the other side. He 
swallowed thickly. They were driv- 
ing him out, a condemned hunted 
pariah; yet this had been his home 
since birth. His foot kicked the 
ladder away. 

He started the descent. 

T he skimmer was ready at last. 

The two days spent in cram- 
ming a basic edutape course in lan- 
guage and history into Esala’s stub- 
born little blonde skull had not been 
wasted entirely. But even so, they 
kept her hands taped together when 
she wore the Eyes for each in- 
creasingly longer period. She wore 
it now as they prepared for takeoff, 
and her taped hands were strapped 
to her seat. 

“We will find other valleys, 
Esala,” Ban Telar told her, “Where 
our children, and the children of 
those who wish to see again, can 
dwell.” 

“The Eyes are evil,” Esala spat 
out bitterly. “I wish to smash them 
all. And the Earthman with them.” 
Dorby Cole shrugged his shoul- 
ders and winked at Ban Telar. “You 
picked a tough one, Ban,” he said. 
“Better toss her back over the wall 
and catch a new one.” 

• “He will not do so!” Esala’s voice 
trembled with rage. “Ban Telar is 
to be my mate. It is you who are 
to blame.” 

Cole looked directly into the 
Eyes that Esala wore. 

“Is it not good to see colors and 
trees, and your mate, Esala?” he 
demanded. “Why do you think the 
Eyes harm you?”

Esala sniffed and shut her lips 
primly. Cole started to turn away. 
And then she spoke again. 

“It is not good that the Old 
Ones should be doubted,” she said. 
“They have told us that sight, that 
seeing, is something imagined by 
children and brainsick fools. So it 
is wrong to make liars of them.” 

“You see?” Ban Telar told the 
Earthman. “Perhaps I must beat 
her. But then she would hate me. I 
do not know.” 

“Give her time, Ban,” advised 
Cole. “Her world is upside-down. 
Remember the first weeks you 
spent,” 

Cole was strapping himself into 
the control seat. When he had fin- 
ished he set about checking the 
gauges and dials on the control pan- 
els. He turned to Ban Telar. 

“Did we remove the covers from 
the rear jets?” he asked. “I think 
they’re free, but would you check?” 

Ban Telar slid out of his seat and 
hurried outside. He checked the 
broad-tailed skimmer’s jets and 
found them cleared. He started back 
toward the cabin’s oval lock. 

And Mert Rodn sprang from the 
concealment of the little ship’s over- 
hang to pin him to the foot-worn 
turf. 

R odn was alone. Apparently none 
of the others had dared risk the 
ladder and the crossing of the Wall. 
But hatred and desire for Esala had 
driven Mert Rodn to follow. 

Rodn’s horny hands were shutting 
off Ban Telar’s wind. Already his 
ears were roaring and redness seem- 
ed to be flooding the Eyes. Con- 



vulsively he struggled, his fists drum- 
ming at the older man’s thick-mus- 
cled stomach. 

His knuckles brushed the handle 
of Rodn’s sheathed knife and he 
groped wildly for the weapon — 
found it! He tugged it out, a task 
complicated by the pressure of their 
two sweaty bodies, and then he 
drove the crudely forged blade into 
Rodn’s side. 

The throttling hands fell away 
and Rodn whipped into furious ac- 
tion. The Eyes were torn from Ban 
Telar’s head. Smashing impacts 
from Rodn’s fists and elbows and 
knees knocked him about and jarred 
the knife from his grasp. In the sud- 
den darkness, once so familiar, he 
felt helpless and tiny as an infant. 

Over and over they rolled, Rodn 
growling savagely, now, his teeth and 
nails ripping at Ban Telar’s hide. 
Telar’s hand clawed for anything, 
a rock, a stick or a wrench. 

He found the knife, its unevenly 
whetted blade laying open in his 
palm. Painfully he reversed the wea- 
pon, using the ground as a base, and 
drove the bloody weapon again and 
again into his huge foe’s body. 

And when Rodn eventually shud- 
dered and fought no more he knew 
that he was dead. 

Dorby Cole came and rolled the 
ugly carcass off him, and patched 
his wounds, but in his mind there 
was a great confusion and an em- 
ptiness. He would not again put on 
the Eyes. 

“No,” he told Cole, “never again 
will I wear the Eyes. Esala was 
right. It was the Eyes that made 
me doubt the Old Ones. Find us a 



66 



IF 




secure valley where we can build 
another Wall for our sons and 
daughters to live behind. But men- 
tion no more to us that evil art of 
seeing that has lost us our native 
village and has made of me a murd- 
erer.” 

“You will feel differently tomor- 
row,” Dorby Cole’s voice said. “It 
is the shock of near-death, and 
your wounds. Surely, now that you 
have seen the beauty of your world 
you will not lose it forever.” 

Ban Telar said nothing. But in 
his mind there was the stubborn 
conviction that this Earthman, this 
demon masquerading as a friend, 
must die before he trapped others 
of the People into believing in see- 
ing. 

If he could only clear his mind 
and make his leaden senses and his 
weakened muscles react. The scent 
of the Earthman was hateful. The 



knife of Mert Rodn was lying where 
his locked fingers had finally drop- 
ped it, and now he found it. He 
lunged at Cole. 

“No, Ban!” said Cole hoarsely. 
“You are confused. Don’t make me 
use the stitcher.” 

The scent of the Earthman was 
sharp and the sound of his vitals 
and the rasping of his feet on the 
turf. He hated the blasphemer. The 
builder of lies must die. 

He sprang. 

And then the needles stung his 
flesh and he fell. He could hear, 
faintly, and the scent of trampled 
grass was in his nostrils. 

“I was wrong,” he heard Cole 
say. “You will get your valley, Ban 
Telar, but no more. You are too 
old to understand ... I must 
teach children from behind the wall. 
Only their minds are unwarped and 
free of superstition.” END

COMMANDOS 

by C C. MacAPP 

Illustrated by NODEL 



The star-swarming armies of 
Gree had a new weapon— and 
Duke had to go and find itl 



I 

T he storm below was a whop- 
per, which didn’t surprise Col- 
onel Steve Duke since the planet 
had a deep atmosphere with a sea- 
level pressure of over forty pounds 
per square inch. Such a storm 
would blind enemy radar, if any. 
It might also incinerate Steve, pro- 



tected only by a thin plastic pod 
and his equally flimsy suit. 

He watched the roiling clouds 
swell toward him, and increased his 
deceleration a little. Presently, air 
pressure dented the pod, but most 
of his speed was gone now and the 
pod didn’t heat. Clouds engulfed 
him, the flare of lightning was all 
around and thunder battered at the 



68 





pod. He endured grimly until he 
was below the lightning and in fog 
so thick he might have been sink- 
ing through milk. It got darker, un- 
til the flares from above were bare- 
ly noticeable. The fog was more 
like ink; a dripping night air so 
dense he could nearly have turned 
off the grav unit and let the pod 
float down. He poked at the plastic 
to see how rigid it was. According 
to his briefings, when the pod got 
limp he’d be near the ground. It 
wasn’t very rigid now. 

Something like a miniature tor- 
pedo with a flashing light in its 
nose came out of the fog, emitted 
a brighter flare, grazed the pod, 
and vanished. He crouched, waiting 
for the detonation. It didn’t come. 

What the devil, he wondered. 
Some kind of a warning shot? Or 
a misfire? It had surely homed on 
him. 

There was nothing he could do 
if they fired a deadly missile; they’d 
be zeroed on him now. At least, 
he thought wryly, he was sure, 
now, that there were Gree forces 
on the planet. Up to now, that had 
been only a computer probability. 

He grabbed equipment, stuffed it 
into pockets and hung things 
around his neck. The pod struck 
and squashed flat, sliding a little. 
Tree branches poked into it, but 
didn’t penetrate the plastic. He 
could hear faint sounds now, pops 
and rumbles, and see reddish flashes 
that didn’t look like laser beams. 
He tore at releases, got one metal 
end out of the pod, and squirmed 
out. 

He was on something that felt 



like packed cotton with a lot of 
sticks in it. He scrabbled away 
from the pod on all fours, thank- 
ing Providence (though his superiors 
deserved the credit), that it was a 
genuine Gree pod and he wouldn’t 
have to hide it. 

H e bumped into a low wall of 
the cottony stuff, and under- 
stood. He was in a tree crown, 
solider than it looked in the sneak 
photos. This was the boundary 
where it reared up, jousting for 
space with a neighbor. He pulled 
himself over and kept going. Now 
he noticed that the crowns slanted 
toward their centers, in a very shal- 
low cone. He remembered that 
they were supposed to be fifty feet 
across, and that checked pretty 
well. He crossed another boundary 
just before strong red light bloomed 
foggily behind him. He peered back 
and found the fog much thinner. 
They were using dispersers, then; 
probably ultrasonic. 

They were standing in the light, 
incautiously, talking about his pod. 
There were six of them, two men 
and four B’lant. The latter were 
humanoids with tough gray skins, 
very effective fighters in difficult 
environments. They wore full plas- 
tic suits and carried unfamiliar 
weapons. 

The fog suddenly boiled around 
them and they all went down ex- 
cept one B’lant who caught him- 
self, whirled, and fired across the 
crown. Steve could hear the sub- 
dued ‘pop’ that accompanied each 
flash of red light. The light beam, 
he thought, would be harmless; for 



GREE'S COMMANDOS 



69 




aiming only. But a dim figure that 
it caught jerked and doubled over 
and was falling before the flash was 
gone. 

' Someone doused the steady red 
light and in a moment Steve, with 
his helmet listeners turned full on, 
could hear sounds as if some of 
the downed men were crawling 
over the boundary. Steve’s mind 
puzzled at it. Concussion weapons 
of some kind — logical, in this air 
— but not fatal, apparently, at 
medium range. Who had fired 
them? Suspicion lanced through 
him. Had the Birds of Effogus — ? 
No, it would make no sense for 
them to invade, after going to all 
the trouble to sneak him down. 

Anyway, he thought, he’d better 
move. He waited until there was 
enough noise to cover him. then 
rolled over another boundary and 
the one beyond it. The fog was 
definitely thin now, though fifty or 
sixty feet above it was as solid as 
ever. There were occasional red 
beams and enough steady glows 
here and there so he could see a 
little. 

A red beam slashed out sudden- 
ly, only two crowns away, and 
impaled a figure just crossing a 
boundary. Steve could see the vic- 
tim — a B’lant — gasp and lose 
consciousness in a way that con- 
firmed the guess about concussion 
weapons. A red flare came on, and 
a squad of six, four humans this 
time, converged on the fallen hu- 
manoid. 

Steve waited for them to put a 
couple more shots into him to make 

70 



sure, but instead two of them bent 
over, unsealed his helmet and seem- 
ed to be giving him first aid. In 
a minute the B’lant came to. They 
helped him up, and though he 
looked sick and was bleeding at 
the nose, he was nowhere near 
dead. 

Understanding suddenly, Steve 
swore to himself. Live maneuvers. 
Not a real fight at all. But it would 
be just as deadly to Steve if they 
located him — which they would if 
he just squatted here. The weapons 
might not kill, barring an unfor- 
tunate kind of hit, but he couldn’t 
afford to be capttired, or even 
knocked out or deafened. He dug 
at the cottony stuff with his hands 
and managed to part it enough to 
squirm in. He groped down for 
something solid to hold to, and dis- 
covered that the crown was sup- 
ported by radial shoots, each three 
or four inches thick at the central 
trunk, and far enough apart a little 
ways out for him to wedge himself 
between. He got himself into the 
least uncomfortable position he 
could and tried to pull the foliage 
together over him. Then he simply 
resigned himself to waiting. 

The Birds’ theory seemed to be 
right. These were commandos, a 
tough chosen lot; and ready for ac- 
tion, judging by the roughness of 
their training. So far, the thrusts 
had been tentative but demoraliz- 
ing to Steve’s side because there 
seemed no way to guard against 
them. Well, that was what Steve 
was here for — to find out how 
they managed to stage into this 
backwoods of the galaxy, through 



IF 





GREE'S COMMANDOS 



71 



all the blockades, watches and pa- 
trols the birds could devise: and 
how they got from here to wher- 
ever they raided. And, if possible, 
why Gree had chosen a world with 
nearly three times the air pressure 
normal for humanoids. 

Steve wasn’t quite on his own. 
There were natives, rather primi- 
tive. that he was to contact. 

It was considered desirable that 
he survive the mission, if conven- 
ient. Knowing Gree’s empire as he 
did, he wasn’t very expendable. 

A t first light he unsealed his 
helmet and was assaulted by 
the forest smell: damp, sweetish, 

moldy. The fog was apparently 
thinning naturally this time. The 
cottony foliage turned out to be 
green, which made him think of it 
more as moss. There were no 
branches below him. Except for the 
radial crown at the top — went 
straight down, with bands around 
it at intervals like monstrous bam- 
boo. into the fog that still hung 
thick beneath the canopy. The 
ground was supposed to be there 
somewhere, three or four hundred 
feet down. 

He worked himself up cautiously 
and looked around, though he was 
pretty sure the commandos 
wouldn’t be on the canopy in the 
daytime, and that their base 
wouldn’t be close by. He was right. 
They’d policed up; even taking his 
pod with them. He hoped some 
supply sergeant wouldn’t get a sud- 
den burst of zeal and check rec- 
ords closely enough to find he had 
an extra pod. 



The canopy was coming to life. 
There seemed nothing that didn’t 
fly; even the things that crept did 
so on adapted wings, and could fly 
in a pinch. There were things from 
insect size on up to condor size. 
The latter were just as wary as 
the small things, which suggested 
probably natural enemies, even 
bigger. 

The predominant body-shape was 
something like a manta ray, but 
with horizontally flat tails and well- 
developed heads on flexible necks. 
There was one common feature 
that was suggestive: everything had 
a third eye, on top or on the back 
of the head, looking to the rear. 

He saw no feathers and no 
chitinous sheaths or membranes. 
Everything looked rubbery. 

There was supposed to be a river 
close by. He thought it would be 
on this side of a ridge that he 
could see to the north. He plowed 
awkwardly in that direction, and 
within an hour could see the break 
in the jungle. He reached the edge 
and looked out over a placid slow- 
flowing river at least a mile wide. 
He squirmed himself out of sight 
and studied it. 

There were flying things over the 
water, mostly of the same general 
pattern, and of all sizes. Fish — 
the first non-flying things he’d seen, 
except for the Commandos — 
broached the surface. There were 
other things that acted equally at 
home in the air or the water. One 
of those was a serpent six or seven 
feet long, with ribbons for wings 
along each side, that twisted its 
way through the air with a fasci- 



72 



IF 




nating motion. Nearly everything 
had carnivore’s teeth — and used 
them. 

He saw nothing on the ground 
below except some small amphib- 
ians or triphibians, but there were 
tracks at the water’s edge. 

The natives were supposed to live 
on the other side. He got out his 
binoculars and settled himself to 
watch. 

II 

I t was past mid-day when he 
saw them. There were eleven, 
in a V formation, flapping ponder- 
ously above the opposite edge of 
the jungle. They wore leather har- 
nesses and back packs, and some- 
thing on their heads that he 
couldn’t make out. He got out a 
signalling device, a sophisticated 
heliograph, adjusted it, and gave 
them five quick flashes. 

Their heads swivelled. They 
pulled up and hovered. There 
seemed to be a conference, then 
one flapped up higher and dipped 
its wings, one after another. That 
might be an acknowledgement. He 
waited. So did they. He gave them 
five more flashes, there was an- 
other conference, and again the fly- 
ing signal. 

Finally they headed out across 
the river. Two flapped up, gaining 
altitude as lookouts, no doubt. The 
other nine stayed fairly low over 
the water and seemed to be hurry- 
ing. 

When they were close he realized 
with a shock that the things on 
their heads were not headgear, but 



trunks like a Terran elephant’s, 
carried in a tight curl. As they 
glided down toward him — they 
apparently saw him from quite a 
ways out — he saw that the trunks, 
about the size of a man’s leg, ended 
in three flexible digits. 

Less than two hundred yards 
away, something startled them. The 
two lookouts came shooting down, 
very fast considering the thick air. 
The whole eleven dove toward the 
riverbank a few yards downstream. 
Steve, who’d been briefed in their 
queer language that sounded like 
boulders being ground together, 
could hear one mouthing orders. 
They were headed for a short con- 
cave arc of riverbank, splitting in- 
to two groups to occupy ends of 
the arc. Two lagged a little, wait- 
ing for the others to land among 
the tree trunks. Then they too 
landed, in the focus of the arc, 
and turned to look up. 

They were very odd-looking on 
land. In the air they were stream- 
lined enough; but aground on their 
wingtips and tails, with the forward 
parts of their bodies tilted up at 
forty-five degrees, they looked like 
monstrous thick three-lobed leaves 
with the stems pointed up. Their 
heads did look like elephants’, ex- 
cept that there were no flapping 
ears, no tusks, and the eyes pro- 
truded, almost on stalks. He judged 
that the biggest — the mature-look- 
ing one who gave the orders — 
weighed twice as much as a man. 

H e followed their gaze. Still far 
up, mere dots, was a big mul- 
tiple V of about three dozen flying 



OREE'S COMMANDOS 



73 




things. They came down in a steep 
dive. Now he could see that they 
were about the size of his prospec- 
tive allies, but had no trunks. In- 
stead, they had snouts like reptiles. 
The smaller things over the river 
scattered. The diving flock checked 
a little a hundred yards up and 
out, as if suspicious. The two de- 
coys hopped end-for-end and ar- 
rowed toward the jungle, each in 
a single leap and glide. They cer- 
tainly looked different in the air. 

The lure must have been over- 
powering. The predators shot down 
in a knot, actually bumping wings. 
Missiles flew from both ends of 
the arc, and several predators 
flopped screeching on the sand. The 
others whirled away from the am- 
bush. 

Defenders leaped from the jungle 
to grab up what missiles hadn’t 
fallen in the river. Steve had to 
classify the weapons as axes. The 
heads were discus-shaped stones 
with flaked edges and holes drilled 
through the middles. The handles 
weren't fixed at right angles, but 
were put on like the fork of a 
wheelbarrow so they were free to 
whirl about the stone, in the same 
plane. The handles were light, and 
as the natives’ trunks hurled the 
weapons with great force, the han- 
dles bent sharply, whipped, and fi- 
nally trailed in the air. A good ar- 
rangement, everything considered. 

The predators were back, more 
cunningly this time, threatening 
enough to draw missiles but mostly 
dodging them. It was obvious the 
defenders would soon run out of 
axes and be overwhelmed. Steve 



stood up, laser pistol in his hand. 
They were ugly things, in a way, 
but they were his allies and they 
fought intelligently. 

He was no more capable of stay- 
ing out of it than of growing an 
extra head. He shot coolly, break- 
ing up the attack, not trying to stop 
individual predators from reaching 
the trees because there were too 
many. Some spotted him and 
flapped to get above him. He 
ignored them until they were close, 
then gave each a frugal rake of 
the beam. One landed almost on 
top of him, still alive enough to 
hop. He burned through its skull, 
then whirled to fire at two that 
had circled to take him from be- 
hind. They thudded near him. Oth- 
ers were coming from several direc- 
tions. He knew the pistol would go 
dead any instant and there’d be no 
time to put another power unit in 
it. The air reeked of burnt flesh 
and the rusting-iron smell of blood. 
He saved his last few ergs of pistol 
energy. 

A stone axe flashed by him and 
hit the closest predator, slash- 
ing its chest badly enough to down 
it. His allies were out of the jungle 
and rallying around him, with few 
axes left but with wooden lances 
ready to fend off as well as possible. 

But the attackers were down to 
half strength and they suddenly de- 
cided they were out-matched. They 
wheeled in unison and shot down- 
river for the nearest bend. Steve 
got a new power unit in the pistol 
as his allies swooped down to sal- 
vage what axes they could.

It took them a while to under- 
stand that he could not fly, and 
when they did they were silent with 
amazement. Then the leader asked, 
as nearly as Steve could understand, 
whether he was at home in the 
water, and added that the river was 
dangerous. Finally Steve had to 
demonstrate how he walked. 

They got busy rigging a harness 
so he could be carried, as they evi- 
dently carried cargo. 

Of the eleven, two were dead 
and one so badly hurt he could not 
fly without help. Most of the others 
had minor gashes. 

There was one thing Steve had 
to do before they left; dispose of 
the predators he’d burned. A laser 
wound would be recognized. He 
said in the native language, “Trou- 
ble, enemy,” and pointed to the 
burns on the carcasses, touched his 
eyes and stared at the burns osten- 
tatiously. They understood, and 
hustled to haul the carcasses out 
over the river and drop them. The 
leader said river creatures would 
eat them. 

They lifted him. dangling, and 
started back across the river. He 
was glad to get away from the 
stink of blood, though he didn’t 
fail to notice that it smelled like 
ordinary protein-life blood. 

There was little talk while flying. 
From gestures and a few words, 
he understood that he’d met a mili- 
tary patrol and that the leader was 
of fairly high rank. His name 
sounded like “Gegego.” He knew 
of the Birds of Effogus, and that 
they’d sent Steve to help in some 
way against the mysterious new 



enemy. However, despite the dem- 
onstration of the laser pistol, Steve 
could see in Gegego’s manner skep- 
ticism as to the effectiveness of a 
being who couldn’t even fly. 

Steve didn’t resent that; it 
amused him, and in general he 
didn’t find them too repugnant. 
They were fine fighters, and though 
they had an odor, it wasn’t un- 
bearable. This whole world assault- 
ed his nose with such variety and 
determination that one more smell 
didn’t matter. 

They hauled him across and up 
the left shore for two hours, then 
turned into a small side-stream and 
slanted down, depositing him gently 
on an elevated walkway or plat- 
form. They’d built a wickerwork 
dam here, below a long pool, and 
along both sides of the pool stretch- 
ed a village. 

T he walkways were tiered one 
above another, from tree to 
tree, and the dwellings were in sec- 
tions of the tree trunks, as if hole* 
had been cut into bamboo so birds 
could crawl in. There were leather 
flaps over some of the openings. 
The tree trunks, this near the 
ground, were as much as fifteen 
feet through, and the natural 
woody divisions between sections 
were secure floors. 

The community fires were on the 
ground, fed by tossing down wood 
from the lowest platform. Most 
wood burned vigorously here, even 
when sopping wet; but the bamboo 
would hardly bum at all. Cooking 
was done by lowering the food on 
bamboo poles (and in bamboo pots. 



GREE'S COMMANDOS 



n 




il need be). There were boiled 
greens and grains, and flat unrisen 
bread, and barbequed meats. Steve 
thought he might as well find out 
at once how the food agreed with 
him, so he ate it, moderately. Some 
of the meat was a little gamey. 

There were only a few females, 
mammalian, and even fewer chil- 
dren. This was clearly an outpost. 

Gegego sent out squads in vari- 
ous directions, then, that afternoon, 
was ready to discuss the common 
aim. They agreed, using Steve’s few 
words and pantomime, that the 
first necessity was to pinpoint the 
enemy and learn what they could 
about him without risking discov- 
ery. Gegego promised all the help 
possible. It seemed the Harnkrah 
(that was what the natives called 
themselves) had been missing pa- 
trols and had had one village shot 
up, without knowing what kind of 
enemy was doing those things, or 
where he came from. 

Later, Steve lay alone in his tree 
section, letting his mind wander 
over the situation as it chose. He 
was going to be with the natives 
quite a while and he didn’t relish 
being hauled around like a fly 
dangling on a strand of spiderweb. 
Probably it would be easy to build 
some kind of a glider here; then 
at least he could be towed. He 
might even tinker up some kind of 
flaps so he could fly without help. 

Also, he could make stronger 
allies of the Harnkrah if he could 
work out some better weapons for 
them. Not to use against Gree, of 
course, but to make it safer for 
Hhern to travel in predator country. 



Their trunks could easily manipu- 
late fixed catapults or crossbows, 
and he’d already seen that, with 
their strength and agility and their 
wide-apart eyes for good ranging, 
they made excellent marksmen. It 
was a shame, though, that they 
only had one trunk apiece. 

D uring the next twenty days or 
so he did little but experiment 
with weapons and gliders and learn 
all he could of the language. He 
picked up the latter fairly well. 

Gegego seized gleefully upon a 
heavy bow, on a post which 
swivelled in a solid mounting. 
“This,” he grated, “will make our 
outposts easier to defend, and help 
us go into lands we have always 
wanted.” He gestured to an aide. 
“I will send a report down-river. 
Soon the river will be lined with 
these.” 

Steve knew by now that the 
Harnkrah had a loose confedera- 
tion that linked the whole area be- 
tween this river and another far- 
ther north, from the sea up to the 
vague frontier. This outpost was 
part of the latter. To settle any 
farther inland meant fighting off 
more predators. A dozen fixed 
bows in a village, with plenty of 
big arrows, could make a differ- 
ence. Still, he didn’t want to be 
pinned down to outposts, so he 
ought to work out something that 
could be fired from the air. 

“What if we made a thing like 
this,” he asked, “but only half as 
big? Could you handle it aloft?” 
Gegego made a pondering' face. 
“I think, no. Not if we flew fast.” 



76 



IF 




“What,” Steve asked, “if two of 
you flew close together? Could one 
hold the bow while the other pulled 
the string?” 

Gegego waved his trunk impa- 
tiently. ‘‘You do not see. We hold 
things in our mouths so our trunks 
can do something else, but the bad 
thing is that this weapon sticks out 
to the sides. The air would make 
it move around.” 

“I was afraid of that. How would 
it be if I made something that did 
not stick out to the sides?” 

“Good, I think, if it had a shape 
so our trunks could hold it tight.” 
“I’ll make something.” Steve said. 
In the process, he came to ap- 
preciate the virtues of the simple 
bow; which, reduced to terms of 
energy acceptance, transformation, 
storage and release, were astound- 
ing. In this thick atmosphere, 
though, he didn’t want high initial 
velocity for the arrows so much as 
more weight; so a less efficient 
launcher — as regards speed of 
energy release — would do. He 
tried helical springs of split bam- 
boo, formed in the heat of a fire. 
It was awkward to get the arrows 
into such a launcher and the 
springs bent too much laterally. 

What evolved was a sort of bird 
cage, with six splints of bamboo 
forming a slender cage. On one end 
was a ring into which the arrow- 
shaft slipped, and against which the 
rear of the arrowhead pressed. On 
the other end was a hollow cylin- 
drical handle, coaxial with the cage. 
When the handle was held firm and 
the ring compressed toward it, the 
splints belled out under tension. 



In the air, a Harnkrah warrior 
carried the weapon in his mouth, 
with the thick heavy arrows in a 
quiver. When he wanted to shoot 
he seized an arrow by the head and 
inserted the other end in the launch- 
er, through the ring, the cage, and 
the handle. The fletched end pro- 
truded far enough beyond the handle 
to grasp with his teeth- Then he 
took hold of the handle with his 
trunk and thrust it forward, pulling 
the arrow farther through and com- 
pressing the cage. When he let go 
with his teeth, the arrow flew. A 
good sharp heavy hardwood point 
made it a formidable missile. 

Gegego hopped with delight, and 
acted as if he were ready to take 
on the whole planet. He sent weap- 
on prototypes downriver with 
strong escorts, and went into pro- 
duction locally. 

Steve had less luck with his fly- 
ing machines. The flap arrange- 
ments could keep him in the air, 
but were too tiring and too clumsy 
at take off. He did learn, though 
how to build a good glider out of 
bamboo and thin leather, and how 
to control it by shifting his weight 
in a comfortable sling. He had to 
settle for being towed to gliding 
altitudes. 

Ill 

R einforcements were arriving 
steadily and Gegego had 
squads pushing upstream and estab- 
lishing new outposts. The local set- 
tlement grew fast and became a 
production center for the weapons. 
Steve decided it was time to send 



GREE'S COMMANDOS

in his second report to the Birds. 

The sender looked like a small 
telescope hung in gimbals so it 
would always point up. Actually, it 
would compress, scramble and 
squirt at a predetermined moment 
any message fed into it. At the 
right moment, a tiny droneship 
would be spacing out above the 
planet to gulp the message and null 
out again with it. There was always 
a small chance of detection, so 
Steve hadn’t used the system any 
more than necessary. 

He fed his report into it and set 
it out on a walkway where it could 
point to the sky. Now that he’d 
run out of work he was restless 
and moody. The smallness of the 
message sender, his only link with 
the galaxy, accentuated his isola- 
tion. He had no way of knowing 
whether his message would ever be 
heard. If not, the Birds of Effogus 
might just write him off and go 
about their investigation some oth- 
er way. 

He paced the platform staring 
down at the huge fires, which were 
kept burning to partially dispel the 
night fog. Creatures of the dark 
flitted in and out of the dancing 
light. The wet wood burned with 
loud pops and hisses, and with a 
punky smell. 

A squad of scouts came volplan- 
ing down from riverward and 
landed on the lowest platform while 
a few youngsters, miniatures in 
every detail of the adults, circled 
excitedly. Seen from above, the 
Harnkrah in flight were very grace- 
ful, and aerodynamically admirable; 
but their total alienness bore in up- 



on Steve. “Damn it,” he muttered, 
“I should have thought of ferment- 
ing some beer or something. This 
is going to get worse.” He turned 
toward his quarters to occupy him- 
self rechecking equipment. 

He’d only been inside a few 
minutes when he heard Gegego’s 
voice calling him, “Ker-nell Doo- 
kuh! Ker-nell Doo-kuh!” He got up 
quickly and stepped outside. He al- 
ways felt better when Gegego re- 
turned. “What is it?” 

“A kullig with a burn like your 
weapon makes!” 

'^phe kullig — the kind of preda- 
tor Steve had fought — was 
dead of wounds from the new ar- 
rows. The burn was older; a seared 
streak and a small hole through 
one wing. He said, “It’s a laser, 
all right. But he might have gotten 
it anywhere.” 

“No,” Gegego said, “it would be 
too painful to fly far. He was on 
this side of the river, two days’ 
flight above here, but I think he 
came from the other side. There is 
a concentration of kullig and small- 
er things there, very unusual. And 
there is something not right about 
the fog.” He made wondering ges- 
tures with his trunk. “I do not see 
why the kullig should gather there. 
Surely this enemy we seek is not 
foolish enough to be caught by 
kullig.” 

“No.” 

“Then,” Gegego continued, “they 
must want the kullig there. Maybe 
to keep us away so we will not 
find them. We would not have 
found it, if you were not here and 



78 



IF 




ff we did not have the new weap- 
ons.” 

Steve thought about it. He had 
no better clues. “Could you set me 
down there, on that side of the 
river?” 

“All alone? It would be very dan- 
gerous for you.” 

“I’m not here on a vacation. I 
can scout the ground with some of 
the things I carry.” 

Gegego said, “I will talk to some 
scouts and be back quickly.” 

Steve added a hasty postscript to 
his report, giving the new data and 
the suspected location, and saying 
he was going to reconnoiter alone. 
Gegego returned and said without 
further protest, “Tomorrow night, 
as soon as the fog comes.” 

The glider slid through fog al- 
ready so thick Steve could see only 
the nearer of the two Harnkrah 
towing him, tandem. Around them, 
especially ahead, was a bedlam of 
shrieks and bellows as Gegego ’s 
warriors bludgeoned a way clear. 
A contorting bulk tumbled out of 
the fog and into it again, and 
splashed into the invisible river. A 
swirling dogfight loomed suddenly, 
and the two towmen whirled aside 
to avoid it. The glider skidded and 
slammed into a kullig, which bel- 
lowed and slashed at a glider wing. 
Steve grinned. The glider only had 
to last a few seconds more. 

They pulled him up sharply and 
the edge of the jungle flashed un- 
der him. The towline went slack 
as the two Harnkrah hovered. He 
shoved his weight back to bring up 
the nose and the Harnkrah dropped 
neatly, each catching a wing. They 



lowered him to the canopy and he 
slid out of the straps and landed 
on the foliage as they hauled the 
glider up and around and vanished 
back toward the river. He was on 
his own. 

He squirmed down through the 
canopy and hooked a strap over a 
tree shoot, then dropped a line over 
it, letting the free end fall. He 
went down, paying out line and 
letting it slide over the shoot for 
a pulley. He landed in giant fungi, 
scattering small creatures in the 
dusk; pulled down his line and 
coiled it as he crouched against the 
tree trunk. Above the canopy he 
could hear the hoarse calls of 
kullig, but he was safe from them 
down here. He activated certain in- 
struments, and, as he’d expected, 
heard only the onset of the nightly 
thunderstorm. He could hear the 
river on his right, so he wasn’t dis- 
oriented; but rather than risk trav- 
eling at night, he thought he’d 
better find a place to hole up. He 
found a fallen tree and wedged 
himself under it, among clammy 
but harmless fungi. 

F or eight days he worked his 
tedious way west, learning how 
to be comfortable or at least 
healthy in the dank sub-world of 
the jungle. There was no natural 
danger there so long as he stayed 
far enough from the river where 
kullig or certain triphibians ven- 
tured in. There was no sign of Gree 
forces. 

On the evening of the ninth day 
his instruments told him he was 
nearing feeble electrical activity.

Now his impatience was hard to 
control. He forced himself to ex- 
plore cautiously, step by careful 
step, until he’d mapped out a fence 
a little way west of a small stream. 
After one more day he knew the 
fence made a right-angle turn at a 
grassy knoll, ran west more than a 
mile, then turned back toward the 
river along another creek. The 
whole, then, was an isolated patch 
of forest with a fence just inside 
its perimeter, roughly square, a 
mile and a quarter on a side. 

He drew back, shaved and 
cleaned up, cooked and ate a goose- 
sized creature, forced himself to 
rest briefly, then changed into a 
Gree-slave gunner’s uniform. He 
hid what equipment he wasn’t tak- 
ing along, and started back to the 
fence. By morning he was across 
the stream and in hiding. 

Two things surprised him. One 
was that a fog dispenser was at 
work, keeping the fence and the 
area within it clear. The other was 
the fence itself. He’d expected 
something like barbed wire, with 
alarm circuits, instead there was a 
vast basketwork of bamboo, with 
vertical posts spaced between the 
trees, reaching clear to the canopy, 
and strong horizontal slats woven 
between. He could see a few wires. 
At spaces, there were dim blue 
lights, high on the fence. 

He heard voices and presently a 
five-man patrol strode along the in- 
side. Three were B’lant; the others 
men. The uniforms were assorted, 
so probably everyone drew fence 
patrol duty now and then. They 
carried, slung on their backs, weap- 



ons that could burn a man in two 
with one slash. 

There was another patrol twenty 
minutes behind the first. Each came 
by twice in three and a half hours, 
then was replaced. None of the 
men showed any distress in the 
heavy air, so they must be well 
acclimated. 

T his close, his instruments reg- 
istered more electrical activity 
deep in the camp, but it was well 
screened and could not have been 
picked up from space. There were 
no large masses of metal close to 
him; certainly none approaching 
the size of even a small Scout ship. 

As soon as it was dark he probed 
along the fence until he found a 
gate, not guarded but locked and 
wired with alarms. That was what 
he’d have to get through, since he 
didn’t dare climb the fence or cut 
a hole in it. He chose certain in- 
struments and went to the gate. 

The condition of the ground 
showed that there’d been some 
heavy foot traffic through the gate 
recently and that didn’t add to his 
comfort. He crouched in shadow 
until the next patrol passed, then 
ran a dim flashlight all around the 
gate, studying wires. 

He found the ones he wanted, 
and clipped to them, on either side 
of the gate, leads of his own which 
he stuck to the fence with gobs of 
sticky stuff. Working in shifts be- 
tween patrols, he sealed onto the 
alarm wires small sleeves that look- 
ed like the kind used to repair 
breaks or join loose ends. These, 
however, were non-conducting and 



80 



IF 





of such material that they would 1 
not melt when he sliced through 
the alarm wires with a thin laser 
beam. He attached instruments tc 
his own leads and poked them in- 
side the fence so he could reclaim 
them quickly from inside. If any- 
one turned a flashlight toward the 






to it. At the top were platforms, 
one of them hinged so it could be 
dropped in the daytime, out of 
sight from above. Now it poked 
up at an angle through the hole. 
There was a rope pulley for hoist- 
ing things. The whole place stunk 
of garbage. 

A winged form swept above the 
hole, barely visible in the faint blue 
light. Steve thought he understood. 
The garbage was taken up to the 
canopy and dumped. This drew 
scavengers, and kullig to prey on 
the scavengers, and assured the 
camp — so they thought — that the 
Harnkrah would stay away. The 
fog was probably only dispelled for 
a short distance above the canopy, 
so there was no danger of being 
seen from above at night, and 
nothing to show in the daytime. 
Besides, it was a better way of 
hiding the garbage than dumping 
it in the river. 

He grunted thoughtfully. In 
Gree’s armies, the garbage detail 
was punishment, hence not com- 
posed of permanent squads. A 
stranger might not be noticed. He 
found a rotted tree with a hole 
near the ground, obscured by a 
fungus, hid his excess gear, then 
settled himself to wait. 

IV 

I t was two hours before he 
heard the detail coming. He 
stood near the base of the stairway, 
in shadow, and simply stepped into 
line at the right moment. The gar- 
bage tubs were sections of youne 
tree trunks, again saving metal. 



Some of the men began to hoist 
those on the pulley. Steve joined 
the ones going up the stairs. 

Six B’lant in clean gunners’ uni- 
forms led the way and stepped out 
onto the canopy, distributing them- 
selves around the hole. Steve paired 
with another man to lug one of 
the tubs out onto the canopy, carry 
it to where a gunner pointed, and 
dump it. A horde of small things, 
some medium size, dove on it. 
Kullig circled warily. One — per- 
haps a greenhorn — croaked bellig- 
erently and swerved closer. A gun- 
ner slashed it with a weak beam. 
It shrieked and did a somersault 
in the air, caught itself and shot 
away. 

The men were mostly glum and 
silent, but at the bottom of the 
stairs one of the B’lant gunners fell 
in beside Steve. “What did you do, 
gunner, zat you get zis punish- 
ment?” 

Steve produced a wry grin and 
answered in B’lant, which he spoke 
perfectly, “I talked back to an 
Overseer.” 

The B’lant grinned. “You were 
zmart. You dodge ze mock-up.” 

Steve looked at him questioning- 
ly. “Mock-up?” 

“You did not hear? Zree zoiiza^* 
go out ze east gate, eight hours 
ago, on big mock battle. On ze 
ground! All zat mud and zings 
crawling around; and real laser 
guns among ze tree trunks!” 

Steve grunted as if in assent. It 
was blind luck he hadn’t stumbled 
into that exercise too; and their 
being out there increased the like- 
lihood that his tampering with the 



82 



IF 




gate would be discovered, soon. 
There was nothing he could do ex- 
cept work as fast as he could. 

He chatted with the B’lant as 
they passed through an inner gate, 
almost ignored by sleepy guards. 
When the tubs were stacked be- 
hind the mess hall, he simply 
walked away as the others did. 

HP here were less than seven 
A hours of dark left now. He 
spent one of them prowling the 
camp, attaching himself first to 
one group then another. There was 
apparently considerable turnover of 
personnel here. The layout of the 
camp was a standard Gree pattern 
of buildings in a circle, their outer 
walls forming a line of defense, 
with the camp’s functions inside the 
circle. 

In the second hour he found a 
closely guarded stockade fifty yards 
in diameter, which seemed to be 
the focus of the technical activity. 
Electrotechs, especially, were ser- 
vicing something inside. The best 
chance for him to get in would be 
to pose as one of those, for which 
he’d need the right uniform. He 
watched various of the techs and 
finally chose a young one who 
seemed a little unfamiliar with the 
camp. He intercepted him. “Excuse 
me. I’ve just come in, and I was 
wondering where I could get this 
fixed.” 

What he showed the man was 
a compact photoscanner, of a type 
a slave had no right to be casually 
carrying around. The tech glanced 
at it and said, “You’d better turn 
that in!” 



Steve looked as irresolute as he 
could. “I know, but I took it from 
a wreck and I don’t want to have 
to explain. I’d pay you for fixing 
it, on the quiet. Or . Ed sell it 
cheap.” 

Even Gree’s slaves could be 
tempted. The young man wavered. 
Steve said, “At least, take a look 
at it for me. There’s nothing wrong 
with that, is there?” 

The tech followed Steve into a 
shadow where light from a window 
cast an isolated shaft. He took the 
instrument from Steve and held it 
in the light. Steve killed him with 
a quick rabbit punch. 

He stood looking down at the 
inert form for a moment. “You 
didn’t suffer any,” he muttered, 
then dragged the body close to the 
building and switched uniforms. 

He strolled into the open, push- 
ing aside his feeling of remorse. 
Now he needed some more specific 
excuse to enter the stockade, and 
maybe he could get it at the elec- 
tronics supply shop. He located that 
and paused just inside the door un- 
til he saw a chance to pick up an 
ammeter that had just been placed 
on the tounter for checking in. He 
was out the door before they 
missed it. He walked boldly to the 
stockade, showed the thing to a 
guard, and said, “Do you have to 
check this through?” 

The guard glanced at the in- 
strument and shook his head, and 
Steve walked by him without an- 
other word, and through the stag- 
gered doorways. He turned, with- 
out pausing, toward the first piece 
of electrical equipment he saw, 



GREE'S COMMANDOS 



83 




whi:h was oni ut a ring of stand- 
ard mobile generators. He paused 
beside it and looked where every- 
one else was looking, at a large 
apparatus in the middle of the 
stockade. 

T here was a metal platform, a 
few inches above the ground, 
with electrodes or projectors of 
some kind pointing toward it from 
six sides and from above. Thick 
cables led to the electrodes from 
generators like the one beside him, 
and other cables converged to a con- 
trol panel where techs were mak- 
ing adjustments. There was an ex- 
pectancy. One of the techs pushed 
a control and a glowing spot ap- 
peared above the platform at the 
focus of the electrodes. It expand- 
ed until it was a luminescent bubble 
clinging above the platform. A 
warning buzzer sounded and there 
was suddenly a humanoid, one of 
the Overseer race, in the bubble. 
He was in a clear plastic balloon 
— not a pod with fittings, but a 
mere bag, tied at its neck with a 
cord. The bag looked very rigid 
with pressure. The luminescent 
bubble collapsed and the bag wrin- 
kled. The Overseer inside slashed 
himself free with a knife and 
stepped out. A tech hurried to pick 
up the collapsed bag and stuff it 
into a hopper. The new arrival was 
already off the platform and talk- 
ing to the Overseer in charge 
locally. 

The bubble formed again, and 
another humanoid, a slave, appear- 
ed in an identical bag. Now they 
came at intervals of a few seconds, 



calmly, forming into squads and 
marching away. At the last, 
wounded came, all under their own 
power, some with splints or exten- 
sive bandages. Finally another 
Overseer materialized, this one 
wounded, judging from his limp, 
though Steve couldn’t see because 
he wasn’t in simple coveralls but 
in a complex plastic suit. Steve 
eyed the suit curiously. It wasn’t a 
standard space type. Of course, 
they might use a special kind, for 
this heavy pressure . Then, sud- 
denly, he saw the whole setup. 

It was an underwater suit! That 
was why they used this planet — 
men based here, living in this air, 
were already adapted to diving! 
Sea commandos; and that explained 
many things. 

But that wasn’t important now. 
The important thing was the ap- 
paratus that transferred them! 
There was no problem in nulling a 
man in a pod, or a suit, or any- 
thing else of such small size and 
mass; but any object had to come 
out of null into virtual vacuum. 
Not that a few atoms of hydrogen, 
say, couldn’t be shunted aside, but 
anything as substantial as an at- 
mosphere — even one percent of 
this one — would demand impossi- 
ble techniques and energy levels. 

What Gree had here, then, must 
be an apparatus for forcing all the 
air out of a certain spot, and a 
null-coordination system accurate 
enough to hop an object exactly 
into the evacuated spot. The theory 
wasn’t new. The practice was sup- 
posed to be impossible. Obviously, 
it wasn’t. Implications came to 



84 



IF 




Steve. One base, a few thousand 
commandos, meant nothing now. 
Such a device could land armies 
right through a blockade! He had 
to get word out. 

H e turned to the generator and 
pretended to be testing it, 
using the ammeter and his body to 
hide the photoscanner. He got as 
many shots as he dared of the ap- 
paratus, not neglecting the cables 
nor the control panel. Then he 
stowed the scanner under his uni- 
form and considered means of 
escape. What he had to do was 
get back to where he’d hidden his 
message-squirter in a rotting tree, 
and feed in what the photoscanner 
held — then get away from the 
sender and avoid capture until the 
message was sent. He didn’t know 
when that would be, but it would 
probably be during the next day. 
There wasn’t apt to be another gar- 
bage detail tonight, so he couldn’t 
use that again. 

At least, he’d better get out of 
this hot spot. He started toward 
the stockade exit, and paused. 
Something was up. Guards were 
listening to their helmet radios, and 
presently several of them left. 
Steve’s mind raced. The chances 
were, they’d found the man he’d 
killed, but hadn’t identified him 
yet. Otherwise they’d be swarming 
to this stockade, not away from it, 
and grabbing everyone in an elec- 
trotech uniform. Ditto about the 
gate. 

Nevertheless, it was too late to 
leave the stockade, let alone get 
through the inner fence. Not by 



stealth. So, if he couldn’t sneak out, 
he’d have to break out; and the 
first step was to create a diversion; 
invent the biggest rumpus he could. 

The closest thing to hand was 
the generator. 

This model had its own grav 
units so it could be flown, and a 
platform where an operator could 
stand. It would be clumsy and slow, 
a childishly easy target for even a 
hand gun, so he couldn’t just jump 
on it and fly away. But he might 
create an excuse for flying it away. 
He slid open the cover of the fuel- 
feed compartment and went to 
work. The fuel was a carefully 
drawn wire of a heavy alloy, stable 
under ordinary conditions but read- 
ily and cleanly fissionable in the 
chamber. If the wire fed too fast 
there could be a runaway. If things 
really got hot the whole spool of 
wire could fission at once. 

Regulators made that almost im- 
possible as an accident — but regu- 
lators could be destroyed. He got 
through some rods, then melted a 
bimetallic component that was sup- 
posed to clamp down under heat 
With his fingers, he pulled the wire 
through the primary feed gate so 
there was a loose loop, being drawn 
too rapidly into the chamber. When 
things began cooking he moved on 
to the next generator as if he were 
testing them all. He didn’t take the 
risk of sabotaging that one too, as 
many eyes would be alert now. He 
moved unobtrusively aside. 

S omeone shouted. There was a 
shocked silence, then a stam- 
pede for the exit that quickly

lammed it. Steve ran back toward 
the generator. He shouted at a tech 
foreman who had stood his ground 
hoping to do something, but who 
was about to change his mind. 

Steve grabbed his arm. “The 
cables. Get them off! I’ll fly it 
away!” He jumped onto the opera- 
tor’s platform and threw switches. 
The foreman gaped, then under- 
stood and ran to disconnect the 
cables. They dropped free and 

Steve lifted the awkward bulk. He 
hoped the accumulators held 

enough charge to keep the gravs 

working. He looked down at the 
faces turned up to him and could 
read the terror and the hope. He 
got over the stockade wall and 

fought the controls to weave a path 
among the trees. The heat was 
scorching — he knew fission 
far away. He’d cut it too fine! 
He’d never reach the dump area in 
time. 

Desperately, he tilted the front 
end up and poured on power. He 
clung to hot metal as the generator 
rammed into the canopy, slewed 
and thrust upward again and finally 
broke through. He hurled himself 
to one side and buried his face in 
the foliage. If the generator got 
far enough into the fog. 

Incredible brightness came 
through his fingers and squeezed 
eyelids, and shock waves hit him, 
one, two, like giant fists. He was 
up and scrabbling away before the 
glow in the fog was gone. He 
wasn’t burned much. If he got 
treatment before too long, the ra- 
diation wouldn’t matter. 

He forced himself to stop and 



think. Which way was the garbage 
dump? There might be several, in 
a ring around the camp. He’d have 
to trust his instinct for direction; 
whatever recollection he had of the 
direction he’d been headed. A few 
feeble lights gleamed under the 
canopy, but they didn’t help. Some- 
thing blundered into his shoulder 
and flapped away with a thin cry. 
Probably the blast had blinded a 
lot of things. 

He moved on the \Vay he’d 
started. Wings whooshed over him 
and he drew the pistol, but kept 
going and the kullig didn’t come 
down. He went as fast as the foli- 
age would let him. Someone would 
have done some thinking by now, 
and they’d soon be on the canopy 
after him. His lungs ached; it was 
like trying to run through high 
weeds. 

A blue light winked on, to his 
left and ahead. He heard 
B’lant and human voices, and at 
least one Overseer. They spread out 
and now he could see gunner uni- 
forms and the heavy beamers. 
There might be a slim chance he 
could surrender, playing it innocent, 
and not be burned down until he 
got a chance to use his own pistol 
or grab one of the heavier weap- 
ons. They wouldn’t be sure, on the 
spot, that he wasn’t a legitimate 
hero . The alternative was to go 
down through the canopy, hope to 
find a tree tall enough to reach 
and slender enough to slide down. 
On the ground, he might still reach 
the message sender. 

More blue lights appeared on the 

IF 



16 




other side of him, and now he saw 
some below, on the ground. That 
hope was gone too. He crouched, 
listening. 

Something small crept by him. 
He grabbed it and hurled it high 
and to the side. It screeched and 
one of the nearest squad sent a 
bolt toward it, and was cursed by 
the squad leader. Steve rolled onto 
another crown, hoping to get be- 
hind the squad. A heavy beam 
lashed at him from another direc- 
tion and someone yelled, “There he 
is!” Blue flashlights swung his way. 
He waited, pistol ready. He might 
take a few with him. 

All the lights suddenly went out 
and there were startled oaths. 
Squads called out to each other, 
questioning, until an Overseer’s 
voice harshed, “Silence!” Steve’s 
stomach went tight. There’d been 
rumor among the Birds of a sup- 
pressor blanket that stilled all elec- 
trical activity above a very low 
level. He moved very quietly. 

An Overseer called, “Get some 
glow bulbs and chemical rifles up 
here!” 

Someone, whimpering, stumbled 
into the crown beside Steve. Steve 
got away from him as fast as he 
could without making noise. The 
man thrashed around until wings 
swept down, then he screamed in 
terror. The wings turned and came 
back, and this time the scream was 
pure agony that ended in a bub- 
bling sound. It hadn’t taken the 
kullig long to discover that the rules 
were changed. They’d be hunting 
by sound, now. Somewhere, anoth- 
er man screamed. 



Suddenly there was weird light. 
Objects tumbled from the fog ceil- 
ing, spilling out whorls of glowing 
gas that mixed with the air and 
continued to glow, spreading ghost- 
ly luminescence over the canopy. 
There was an explosion somewhere 
that made the trees shake, and 
three more in quick succession. In- 
candescence erupted half a mile 
away, boiled up into the fog and 
faded. A rattle of rifle fire broke 
out somewhere and spread, the old 
cartridge kind. There was shouting 
everywhere now. An ancient bullet- 
firing machine gun went burp-burp- 
burp-burp, somewhere close, and 
ended in a bang like an explosive 
bullet. 

Close to Steve, a squad led by 
an Overseer with glow bulbs tied 
around his waist came up out of a 
hole, lugging another machine gun, 
and frantically set it up. Steve 
crept toward them with his knife 
out. A kullig swooped toward the 
squad. The Overseer turned to put 
an explosive bullet into it, and as 
he did he saw Steve. Steve’s knife 
beat the revolver but he only stuck 
the Overseer in the shoulder and 
the pistol steadied again. 

Huge arrows flashed into the 
dim light and knocked the Over- 
seer flat, and the flight of Harn- 
krah wheeled and split and came 
in again from two sides and rained 
arrows on the squad. Steve lay still 
because they wouldn’t recognize 
him in this uniform. Then some- 
thing that was not a Harnkrah and 
not a kullig came flapping over. 

Steve called, “Here! Here! It’s 
Duke!” 



GREE'S COMMANDOS 



87 




The slow wings, feathered ones, 
turned toward him and the Bird 
of Effogus came down to land on 
its elf-human feet, swearing softly 
as they tangled in the foliage. 
“Colonel? What air! Like flying in 
molasses!” 

More of the Birds converged, 
carrying toysized rifles that must 
have fired the unfamiliar explosive 
bullets, mopping up and forming a 
cordon around Steve and the high- 
ranking Bird who’d landed. That 
one had found a better place to 
stand, and now folded its wings and 
smoothed them with its miniature- 
human hands, so that it looked like 
an elf wearing a bulky cloak. 
“What a world!” it whispered, “We 
got worried when you reported you 
were taking off alone, and came 
down to talk to your friends. When 
that blast went off we recognized 
your delicate touch, and called the 
ships down.” It chuckled. “How did 
our blanket work? It’s never been 
tried before on a large scale.” 

“It worked,” Steve said. His 



throat felt tight. There weren’t 
enough of the Birds so they took 
part in many actual battles, and 
they’d come down after him. “I . 
didn’t expect you,” he said foolishly. 

He watched another Harnkrah 
approach, and recognized Gegego. 
Gegego was calling loudly, and in 
a moment other Harnkrah appear- 
ed towing Steve’s glider, which 
made the high-ranking bird chuckle 
dryly again. 

“Are you all right?”. Gegego 
asked anxiously, landing. He and 
the high-ranking Bird seemed to 
know each other already, exchang- 
ing nods. Steve thought, Vm a little 
out of place among all these flying 
things. 

Then he remembered something, 
and felt better again. “Sir, there are 
three thousand armed commandos 
on the ground somewhere, on ma- 
neuvers, and they undoubtedly 
know what’s happened. I think we’d 
better get on about rounding them 
up, so we can write this whole 
thing off and relax.” END

IF • Short Story 



ZOMBIE 

by J. L FRYE 



Invulnerable, handsome, strong, 
perceptive— why did the Zombies 
long so passionately for death? 



T he cold winter night was seep- 
ing into the nuclear submarine 
pens and the hour was late. How- 
ever, a surprise inspection is just 
that and Rear Admiral Zagorski 
was at least warmly dressed. Now 
that the inspection was going well 
he was even becoming pleased. 

That was a -tremendous change 
from his first reaction on being 
dragged out of bed at a late hour 
of the night. Only two possibilities 
had occurred to him then. The first 
and least likely was war. And the 
second — well, as an officer and a 
non-party member he slept with a 
gun in his hand. 

As it had turned out, it was a 
surprise inspection by none other 
than General Kazan himself. Mid- 



night was an odd hour for an in- 
spection but the general’s unortho- 
dox methods were well known. He 
hurried from ship to ship with only 
his own aide and the admiral. 

There he would look about with 
his hands in his overcoat, not even 
bothering to wake the crews or the 
maintenance groups. Sometimes he 
disappeared into the interiors of the 
atomic submarines while his aide 
occupied the admiral with the usual 
questions that the brass invariably 
have asked. At other tirties the gen- 
eral would stand with him talking 
in perfect Russian, but for his na- 
tive Georgian drawl, while his aide 
would disappear into the subma- 
rines, only to return and quickly 
move on. 



19 



Pleased with himself, the admiral 
found himself smiling as the inspec- 
tion drew to a close. He stared at 
the big, broad-bodied general and 
thought that he looked much bigger 
than he did in his pictures. But 
there was no mistaking that face. 
Then the general pointedly made 
clear that he was not inspecting 
to find things that shined and 
sparkled as they would in any reg- 
ular inspection. He wanted to get 
the general gist of the operation. 
He even made a little joke with 
the admiral — said he wanted what 
the American Army would call “the 
Big Picture” — and they laughed 
quietly together. All in all, he 
seemed pleased with what he saw 
and praised the admiral casually. 

Admiral Zagorski was so pleased 
that he went overboard to arrange 
transportation for the general. His 
tactics on his lightning inspection 
tours were well known. To preclude 
forewarning, he was arranging all 
his transportation as he went, with- 
out using his rank or name. 

A helicopter was quickly sent to 
the underground pens to take him 
to the air field near Leningrad. Un- 
til it came the general and the aide 
were guests of the admiral and 
they drank vodka and talked lightly. 

Before following his aide into 
the helicopter the big general stood 
for a moment looking down into 
the admiral’s face while the wind 
blew between them. “Zagorski,” he 
said. “I would continue to sleep 
with that pistol handy, were I you.” 

Zagorski numbly returned his sa- 
lute and watched him board the 
helicopter. 



A Begal was warmed up and 
waiting on the tarmac as the 
helicopter settled down close by. A 
covey of military police and the 
officer of the day met the general 
and escorted him to the waiting 
plane. Once inside he told the pilot 
to clear for Kiev but that 
would change at the last minute 
and go to Kharkov. However, since 
he wished to make a surprise in- 
spection there, it was necessary that 
the tower not be informed of the 
true destination. 

The pilot, like everyone in the 
military, was familiar with the gen- 
eral’s eccentricities. Even more im- 
portant, he knew what the general 
had done in the past with subordi- 
nates who objected. There was no 
question and quickly the plane was 
in the air. 

The general and his aide settled 
down to wait. 

Shortly after the pilot had veered 
from Kiev to Kharkov a message 
was received over the radio sys- 
tem. The general and his aide 
joined the two pilots in the cockpit. 

It seemed that a missile complex 
on the Kola Peninsula had been 
sabotaged. While they waited for 
further information a second mes- 
sage came through. The submarine 
pens near Vyborg had also been 
sabotaged. 

“That’s where you were, wasn't 
it, sir?” asked the pilot, a colonel. 

“Yes,” answered the general, 
standing behind him. Looking side- 
ways he could see his aide standing 
behind the co-pilot. 

“We’re only twenty minutes from 
Kharkov now, sir,” the pilot said.

IF 




“We’ll have to clear for their pat- 
tern now.” 

“That’s too much trouble to 
bother with,” General Kazan said 
in perfect English. As the two pilots 
turned in surprise to look up at 
him, he and his aide brought heavy 
arms down on the pilots’ heads, 
crushing them. 

Less than two hours later they 
were free-falling near Samsun in 
Turkey. As their chutes opened and 
slowed them, Kazan watched the 
plane starting back across the wa- 
ter. He chuckled to himself as he 
thought of the trouble somebody 
was going to have trying to trace 
its whereabouts. Its autopilot would 
carry it about half way across the 
Black Sea before the bomb they’d 
left was triggered. Then, out of 
sight of land, there would be an 
explosion and the plane would fall 
into the sea. Poor General Kazan, 
he thought. If they even begin to 
trace this night’s activities, it is all 
going to be at your doorstep. 

Just outside of Samsun they met 
their pickup and soon were at one 
of the USAF bases. There, trans- 
portation back to the States was 
waiting. 

T he doctor met them at the air- 
port with a car. No sooner 
were they in it than he turned to 
them. 

“Well done,” he said. “Now lis- 
ten. You know how short-handed 
we are. Well, one of you has to 
make the change right away so he 
can be going again by the end of 
next week. I’ve a job for the other.” 
When neither of them said any- 

ZOMBIE 



thing to him he ordered, “Don’t sit 
there talking to each other! 1 don’t 
have the equipment here to listen 
in.” 

“Okay, Doc,” said the one who 
had been the aide. “We’re both 
pretty close to the deadline. Bat 
the general there — ” he gestured to 
the other — “has less time left.” 
“Oh? So it’s the general now,” 
the gray-haired doctor said. “You’re 
letting rank go to your head, Pete.” 
“I thought I made a pretty good 
general,” answered Pete pleasantly. 

“My turn next time,” laughed 
Joel, the ex-aide. 

“Well, la-dee-da,” growled the 
doctor. “I’m the one that puts the 
faces on. So I think I’ll be the one 
to decide who is going to imper- 
sonate whom.” 

7 wonder what they’ve got 
cooked up now that’s so hot ? Pete 
sent Joel. Then he asked out loud, 
“How did it really go over there?” 
The doctor gave him a long look, 
then shifted so that he’d be more 
comfortable talking over the front 
seat. “Perfectly,” he said slowly. 
“Total destruction on both. It’ll be 
years before they’ll have them back 
in the condition they were before 
your visit. As for Kazan himself — • 
well, Admiral Zagorski sang very 
nicely when the Cheka finally 
caught up with him.” 

“Give ’em much of a chase?” 
Pete asked. 

“Took three of them,” answered 
the doctor. Pete’s face smiled. “But 
he named Kazan and the OD at 
the Leningrad place concurred. 
They’ll both be shot, and with no 
alibi Kazan will go down with 

n 




them.” he stopped chuckling. 
“They’re having fits trying to figure 
out what happened to that plane.” 
Then the car stopped before a 
guarded gate and the conversation 
with the doctor ceased. The two 
in the back seat continued to dis- 
cuss the new job in their own man- 
ner; this made no sound, however. 

The car pulled up in front of a 
large, single-storied building. The 
seat protested with squeaks as Pete 
slid his heavy body across it to the 
door. He got out, staring at the 
building and the legend above the 
door. PROS LAB, it said. As they 
began to file silently into the build- 
ing a thought crossed his mind. 

In a way it all started here. 

T he Cold War had never taken 
the turn so much feared in 
the fifties and sixties. Instead, with 
the emergence of Red China as a 
major world power, it had degen- 
erated into a hot war of intrigue. 
Unfortunately, this was no more 
final a solution — without escala- 
tion to total war — than the earlier 
situation. In this atmosphere there 
was an almost accidental meeting 
between a brilliant scientist and an 
imaginative President at a cocktail 
party one evening. 

The scientist had been specializ- 
ing in prosthesis. Only he went far- 
ther; he developed a completely 
prosthetic man. 

The one problem that he couldn’t 
solve directly was the brain, the 
mind. He finally did this indirectly 
by utilizing the findings of another 
field. The computer people, while 
working with biophysicists, had de- 



veloped a plasma capable of re- 
cording and sustaining brain pat- 
terns. Their intent had been to find 
some way of preserving the mind 
while performing extensive opera- 
tions on the brain. 

In the past such operations had 
been unsuccessful because the pa- 
tient’s personality or reason, or 
both, were altered radically. Almost 
by accident it was discovered that 
the brain, when successfully trans- 
ferred, could operate independently 
of its organic body, with no loss 
of personality or reason. 

When the two developments 
were mated, the Zombie was born. 

The body was physically perfect, 
though it stood six-six and weighed 
three hundred pounds. Near-perfect 
synthetic skin made the resulting 
figure impossible to tell from a hu- 
man being, except by microscopic 
or X-ray examination. It was pos- 
sible to sensitize the eyes in both 
the infra-red and the normal bands, 
so that vision would be perfect 
even at night. The new, compact 
transceivers could be buried into 
the body, activated by thought, 
achieving an almost telepathic re- 
sult. The body could withstand ex- 
treme ranges of temperature and 
great shock. 

However, it was not without its 
defects. Not everyone could oper- 
ate one. The brain transfer involved 
such prolonged pain that few could 
survive it without insanity. And it 
was discovered (after four deaths) 
that three weeks was the maximum 
time that the brain could survive 
outside of its natural body. After 
that, it deteriorated rapidly. 



92 



IF 




The President had listened care- 
fully to the scientist, then had 
dipped into his emergency fund to 
finance what came to be called 
Operation Zombie; it was a com- 
pact army of superb spies and sab- 
oteurs, made up of almost unstop- 
pable and unkillable men. 

Zombies. 

And that’s what I am, thought 
Pete, as he stopped before a door 
marked No Admittance. 

H e swung the door open slowly 
and looked in. There was an 
iron lung on one side of the room, 
with a man lying in it who waved 
feebly at him. 

“Hi, George,” he said kindly. 
Then he looked at his own body. 

It lay on the other bed in the 
room. The face was disfigured and 
half burnt away. The legs were 
thin and half wasted and so were 
the arms. Crippled and ugly for 
twenty-two years of my life, he 
thought. 

And not even enough nerve ends 
to graft to. 

Hey , Pete . came the thought into 
his head. You keep sending out 
pleasant thoughts like that and / 
will get out of this overcoat and 
let you have that job without an 
argument. 

Pete realized that he had uncon- 
sciously been sending while he 
thought. He, as all the others, had 
to be careful; otherwise everyone 
would know what he was thinking 
all the time. Every thought wasn’t 
necessarily sent, but thought was 
the way the transmitter was trig- 
gered and any thought could be 



sent. And these thoughts aren’t any 
more pleasant to them than me, he 
thought; but he didn’t want to send 
that. 

It was strange to him, but only 
the crippled and the infirm seemed 
to make a success, with the over- 
coats, as the prosthetic bodies were 
called. It seemed that only those 
who wanted out of their bodies so 
terribly bad that they would go 
through hell — which was approxi- 
mately what it felt like — could do 
it. The time sense was distorted 
during the five-minute process, and 
the pain (which was indescribable) 
seemed to last for years. He per- 
sonally felt that it wasn’t even sub- 
jectively that long. But after a 
while of unabated and unvarying 
pain it didn’t seem to make such 
difference. You couldn’t black out 
or faint and you didn’t grow numb. 
You went through it once to get 
in, and once to get out. Every 
time. 

It was hell. 

Sometimes an operative would 
come back from a mission to find 
that his physical body had expired. 
Then there was only the wait for 
death. The deterioration of the 
mind in the plasma wasn’t painless 
either. The time it took was just 
as .subjectively lengthened as the 
transfer. 

One Zombie had come back that 
way . and stuck his head in the 
atomic furnace so he could die 
painlessly. 

Pete! sent the doctor. He knew 
the doctor was using his desk con- 
sole and really couldn’t blame him; 
that man had invented the damned 



ZOMBIE

overcoats but he was too smart to 
get in one. Get on down to the 
office , Pete? 

Coming, he sent as he closed the 
door and started down the hall. 
But not for God , country, or moth- 
er! and he sent that too, before he 
closed off his thoughts again. Cur- 
rently he’d been informed that the 
research boys were working on the 
sleep factor. It was fact that an 
operative in his overcoat needed no 
sleep and found it impossible to 
get any. This had pfbved an asset 
more often than a hindrance; how- 
ever, they claimed that this might 
be the key to the three-week limit 
and might explain why transfer to 
fresh plasma resulted in death for 
the operative. Only by transfer to 
the natural-born body could the 
operative’s life be prolonged. Then, 
too, on return to the natural body 
the brain just went to sleep. The 
length seemed to depend directly 
on how much time had been spent 
in the overcoat. 

Then he was at the office. 

J oel, the doctor and one other 
man were seated there. 'Bout 
time, Joel sent. 

“ ’Bout time,” sputtered the con- 
sole. 

“Let’s not be kids,” said the doc- 
tor tiredly. “When you’ve something 
to say, just say it. Don’t act like 
rookies!” 

“Yes, sir, Doc!” two voices boom- 
ed out of the console. 

The doctor frowned and leaned 
back in his chair with his pipe. And 
that’s something else they didn’t tell 
us, Pete thought. The prosthetic 



bodies could see, tell a difference 
in temperature, and had a pretty 
good sense of touch; they just 
couldn’t derive any physical pleas- 
ure. They were built to look exact- 
ly like a man at all times. They 
could smoke, drink and eat but 
there was no sensation to it. The 
chemists had even told Pete that 
he’d been poisoned four times. He 
hadn’t known it. “Well,” Pete said. 

The doctor flipped off the desk 
console and asked, “What’s the 
weakest part of our organization?” 
What do you think he's got up 
his sleeve this time? sent Joel. 

Beats me! sent Pete. He said, 
“The number of us. There aren’t 
very many. Then, this place right 
here. One bomb and there’s going 
to be an awful lot of dead me 
walking around.” 

“That,” stated the man who’d not 
spoken, “is why I’m here. You don’t 
know me but that’s not necessary.” 
Another one, sent Joel, Looks 
down his nose at us Zombies. 

“We going to work together?” 
Pete asked. The man looked away 
from him without any desire to 
work together on his face. 

“We caught him trying to get in- 
to this place while you were . 
away,” said the doctor. “He’s on 
our side now. Has to be . But 
we’re wasting time. Neither of you 
has much more than twenty-one 
hours. So who’s going?” 

“I am,” answered Pete quickly. 
Pete ! Joel sent. I've got at least 
three hours on you. I should be 
the one to go. 

Not if you had seventeen hours 
on me, Pete sent. 



94 



IF 




You’re pushing your luck, sent 
Joel. You trying to kill yourself? 

I don't know , Pete sent. Aloud 
he said, “I’ll go down to surgery 
so they can be changing this face 
of mine. You wouldn’t want any- 
body to wonder what Kazan was 
doing walking around while he was 
being taken before a firing squad. 
Tust radio me the dope.” Then he 
turned and walked quickly out. 

“They always act like that?” 
asked the stranger, sneering. 

“What are you trying to say?” 
Joel snapped as he came to his feet. 

The doctor shrugged and flipped 
on the console. “Joel,” he said. “You 
go on down to the transfer room. 
I’m really going to need you next 
week. The sooner you’re out the 
better I’ll feel.” 

“Why not two of us on this job?” 
Joel asked angrily. 

“I just want one man killed,” an- 
swered the doctor. 

I t was almost nine at night 
when Pete finally stood in the 
street. Looking up Broadway, it 
seemed like nothing but night clubs 
all the way to the tunnel and on 
both sides of the street. For a mo- 
ment he couldn’t help but stand 
and enjoy the night scene. He 
could, if he wanted, see it as clear 
as day; but he didn’t use his infra- 
red vision. The contrast of the night 
and the lights was too pleasing 
without it. He stood for several 
minutes as the wind flipped his 
trench coat; he knew that the wind 
was cold, but he wasn’t cold. Final- 
ly he patted the .45 under his arm 
and joined the crowd. 



He had a different face, and a 
different name, and the papers to 
prove both. He also had a man to 
find and twelve hours were gone. 
He knew where to go now, though. 

As he casually walked with the 
crowds toward his destination he 
ran over what he knew again. The 
principal man involved was called 
Linder. He was a free-lance vendor 
of information; he sold to the high- 
est bidder, no matter what nation, 
and often to more than one. He 
held the reins over a small-time 
outfit of hoods in the city. It often 
works that way, he thought. They 
have money and they can get in 
with the crooks and the gangsters. 
They let themselves be used till 
they have control — and then 
there’s just one more gangster in 
the river. 

Poor guy, thought Pete. He 
should have kept his nose out of 
Operation Zombie. We’re too vul- 
nerable. We can’t even be present- 
ed to the American public because 
we kill and sabotage. 

Up ahead was a little nightclub, 
the kind specializing in second-rate 
strip-tease and watered-down 
drinks. A small-time hood by the 
name of Scobbs owned it with a 
silent partner called Gilby. They 
used it as a front for their more 
lucrative activities, like the one 
Linder was coming to see them 
about tonight. In a way, he thought, 
I’m doing them a favor Linder 
would have them both in the river 
inside a year. 

His thoughts ended as he came 
up to the entrance of the club. 

Music, laughter, and talk flowed

out of the door. Well, thought 
Pete, it’s time to go back to work. 

The bouncer eyed him warily as 
he came in. Pete returned his stare. 
“Scobbs here?” he asked, letting a 
sneer fill his face. 

“Whadaya want with him?” the 
bouncer asked, standing in his way. 

“That,” said Pete, “is between 
Scobbs and myself, punk!” 

The bouncer stood undecided for 
a moment and Pete almost laughed. 
The guy didn’t know whether he 
should take insult from him, or 
whether he was a friend of Scobbs 
or not. Before he’d made up his 
mind Pete said, “I’ll wait.” And he 
walked around him. 

H e sat at a table that had a 
“Reserved sign” on it. From it 
he could watch the door and keep 
his back to a wall. On the small 
stage a shapely girl was dropping 
the last of her clothes and wiggling 
more or less in time to the music. 
A waitress came up to his table 
and said, “This table is reserved.” 
Pete looked slowly up at her. 
Two men were coming through the 
door. The bouncer stopped one of 
them and pointed toward Pete. “I 
don’t mind at all, honey,” he said, 
standing up. 

The men looked at him for a 
moment and then went past the 
bar and through a door marked 
private. The bouncer started toward 
Pete. 

“Okay, buddy,” he said as he 
came closer. “I’m going to take you 
around back and show you just 
who’s a punk and who’s not.” 

It was merely a feeling, but he 



was sure there was another stand- 
ing close in behind him. “Do I 
walk?” asked Pete. “Or does it taka 
two of you punks to carry me?” 
They were big men and each 
grabbed one of Pete’s arms. He 
didn’t resist, but simply relaxed and 
allowed them to drag him. Togeth- 
er they managed to get him past 
the bar and through the back door, 
but they were surprised at his 
weight. As the door slammed shut 
behind, the second man put a full 
nelson on Pete while the bouncer 
took his time taking off his coat 
and rolling up his sleeve. 

“You haven’t been a bouncer for 
long.” It was a statement the way 
Pete said it “I’ve got a rod.” 

“That, buddy,” the bouncer said, 
“you’ll never get a chance to use.” 
“No,” said Pete, smiling. “I just 
won’t need to.” 

He shifted his weight so that the 
man holding him had to support it, 
and at the same time he shoved 
backwards with his feet. All his 
weight slammed the man into the 
wall only a few feet behind. The 
bouncer jumped forward and Pete 
lashed out with his foot, catching 
the man in the knee and dropping 
him to his hands and knees. Break- 
ing the nelson, he swung his arm 
down on the bouncer’s head. Then, 
reversing, he brought his other fist 
into the face of the other. 

Pete stood up, straightened his 
tie, and went back inside. One of 
the men would never get up again. 
The other would wish he couldn’t. 

The bartender’s face went white 
as Pete stepped through the door. 
When he made a move for what- 



96 



IP 




ever he kept under the bar, Pete 
casually opened his coat so that his 
gun was visible. The bartender went 
back to wiping the bar top and 
Pete turned to the door marked 
“Private”. It was locked. 

He broke the knob off in his 
hand, opened the door and walked 
in. 

He followed a short hall to a 
thick door. Deciding it must be the 
door to Scobbs’ office, he tried it, 
found it open and walked in. There 
were two men in the room. One, 
Scobbs, sat behind an over-large 
desk; the other, Gilby, stood in the 
middle of the room. There was also 
a girl. 

He only glanced at her as he 
closed the door but it was enough 
to notice that she was tied in her 
chair. He was also sure that she 
was the most beautiful woman that 
he’d seen, even though her face 
was red and puffed. Evidently Gilby 
had been slapping her. 

W hat the hell?” snapped Scobbs 
from the desk. 

“Just a friendly little call,” smiled 
Pete as he tossed the broken knob 
onto the desk. It gave him a pleas- 
ant feeling to see the expressions 
on men’s faces as the knob bounced 
across the desk and off into Scobb’s 
lap. “I’m a friend of Linder’s. Can 
you tell me where he’s to be 
found?” Pete asked, moving close 
to Gilby. 

“I never seen you before,” Gilby 
said. He was a big man but found 
himself looking up at Pete. 

“He’s coming here,” whimpered 
the girl in the chair. 



“You stay shut up!” shouted Gil- 
by, starting to slap her. 

Pete caught his arm, straightened 
it out and broke it at the elbow. 
“That’ll make it a little harder to 
get to your gun,” he laughed as 
Gilby screamed. He continued to 
hold onto the man’s arm. “Be 
good,” he continued. “Or I’ll start 
jerking it.” Then he turnfed to face 
Scobbs, who hadn’t moved. 
“Scobbs,” he said quietly. “I dare 
say you’ve a gun somewhere. Try 
for it and you’re a dead man.” 

He dropped Gilby’s arm and Gil- 
by winced. “You move,” Pete said, 
moving behind the chair to untie 
the girl, “and I’ll break the other 
one.” As he untied her he became 
aware once again just how beauti- 
ful she was. She had a classical 
face and a full body and long blond 
hair. That’s another thing, he 

thought bitterly. You still have the 
wants — and you can’t do a damn 
thing about them. 

Then she was loose and he told 
her to stay where she was. “Gilby,” 
Pete asked, “who’s the girl?” 

“Ask her yourself!” 

“T’m . .” 

“Be quiet, honey,” Pete said 
sharply. As he moved back to Gilby 
he talked mildly. “What, pray tell, 
Gilby, did I tell you?” When there 
was no answer he jerked the arm 
again. 

“Okay!” Gilby moaned. “She’s the 
niece of . .” 

“I have a gun pointed at the 
middle of your back,” said a voice 
from the doorway. “Raise the hands 
slowly.” 

“Linder, I suppose?” The man 

*7 



ZOMBIE 




didn’t answer but the expression on 
Scobbs’ face gave Pete the answer. 
“Now would be a good time to get 
your gun out, Scobbs,” Pete 
sneered. 

A s Scobbs went for it, Pete 
wheeled Gilby between him 
and the doorway. He had his own 
gun out and shot Scobbs in the 
head before the little man had his 
drawer open. Two slugs from the 
gun of the man at the door ripped 
through Gilby and he screamed. 
Then, with tlifr dead weight of Gil- 
by pulling him off balance, Pete 
was firing at Linder. Then his right 
leg collapsed. He fell. Linder’s face 
dropped away as he tumbled back- 
ward with his blood spurting out of 
his neck. 

Pete rolled Gilby’s body off him 
and started to stand up, only to 
fall heavily on his face. One of 
Linder’s bullets had gone through 
his right knee. The leg was useless. 

Then the girl was helping him. 
He thought that it was amazing 
that she’d come through untouched 
— and that she was very beautiful. 
“Hand me the chair,” he said. 

She did, a strange expression on 
her face. Pete broke the front legs 
and the seat off the chair. Then, 
using it as a crutch, he managed to 
stand up. “Is there a back way out 
of here?” he asked. 

“Yes. Behind that curtain.” She 
pointed. 

“You’re very beautiful, you 
know,” he said, putting his left arm 
over her shoulders. 

She kissed him quickly on the 
cheek and helped him out through 



the curtains. As they slid into the 
taxi she’d flagged down. The police 
cars were converging on the club. 
“I wonder what that’s all about?” 
asked the driver after Pete had 
given him the destination. 

“A riot,” Pete said. He took both 
of the girl’s hands in his so that 
she couldn’t look too closely at his 
leg, searching for blood that wasn’t 
there. Then he decided to keep her 
really occupied so he pulled her 
close and kissed her.* 

She responded. He could tell that 
much. But it was pure nothing to 
him. No wonder they call us 
Zombies, he thought. But he really 
didn’t want to think about it; she 
was too beautiful. And — bitter 
thought — any woman would be 
too beautiful for him, anyway. 

There was construction going on 
at the Bay Bridge. They were de- 
toured to the next one. The first 
pang of fear crossed his mind as 
he looked quickly at his watch; 
only two hours left. 

Pete cursed to himself for the 
delay and for being forced together 
with this beautiful woman. Oh, they 
gave you a handsome face, he 
thought, and a perfect body. A 
real walking Valentino. His 
thoughts remained as black while 
she sat close to him and the taxi 
sped on. 

As it was, they were in Oakland, 
driving around Lake Merritt, when 
the cabbie’s radio beeped into life. 
What it said was clear and simple: 
“Man and woman sought. Man: 
handsome, about six-six, dark hair, 
maybe limping with right or left 
leg. Woman ... The cabbie hit the 



98 




brakes and brought the car to a 
sudden stop. He wasn’t sure, but 
that cabbie wasn’t taking any 
chances. He jumped out the door 
and started running. 

It was so quick that by the time 
Pete recovered the man was twenty 
feet away. He slammed open his 
door and held his gun out. “Stop! 
Or I’ll fire,” he yelled. The man 
didn’t even hesitate. 

Pete could have dropped him at 
the range but he put the gun back 
into his holster. Quickly he wrote 
a name and a telephone number 
on a slip of paper and gave it to 
the girl. “Get out and find a phone,” 
he snapped. “Tell them where you 
are. They’ll pick you up; tell them 
I’ll met a chopper just this side of 
the tunnel if I can’t make it to the 
pickup point.” She hesitated, read- 
ing it. “Move!” snapped Pete. 

“But this is my uncle’s name,” 
said the girl hoarsely. 

“Well, that explains what you 
were doing at Scobbs* place — but 
move!” He was already crawling 
over the seat. With one foot he 
wasn’t going to be driving very 
well, but he had a chance — if he 
could get far enough before they 
set up roadblocks. The girl clear, 
he punched the accelerator. 

Lights I can ignore, he thought 
as he roared through a red one at 
an increasing pace. But my time is 
running out. 

I t was beginning to look easy 
as he passed the last of the 
houses. To his left the road border- 
ed a sharp drop off, a long ravine 
with an inclined side and lots of 



trees and brush. He saw the red 
light in the rear view mirror at the 
same time he heard the siren be- 
hind him. 

Good for you, cabbie, he thought. 
But there was only a mile left to 
the tunnel and the pickup point 
was at the other end. 

At half a mile to go his infra- 
red. vision could see the otherwise 
invisible road block. The car be- 
hind him was still gaining. He went 
another quarter mile closer before 
he swung the wheel hard to the 
left, crossed the double line and 
threw himself into the back seat. 
The car flew off the edge of the 
road. 

The sirens were still going some- 
where and the car was spinning 
over and over. He prayed he didn’t 
hit anything hard enough to com- 
pletely flatten the car and entrap 
him. Then there was a lurch, the 
smell of gasoline, a sliding and an 
explosion. 

He sat watching the car burning 
for a moment. He could have 
gotten out, but he was just as 
happy to have been thrown clear. 
Even when it dosn’t hurt it’s not 
a nice feeling to know that you’re 
burning. He’d had two hours last 
time he’d looked and he looked at 
his watch again; it had stopped. 
He rolled over and began crawling 
up the ravine toward the tunnel 
and the pickup spot. 

His body wouldn’t grow tired nor 
hurt, but panic and doubt could 
still assail his mind. 

If only Operation Zombie had 
some kind of jurisdiction in the 
states all this would be unnecessary. 



ZOMBIE 



99 




Fat chance that, he laughed to him- 
self. They can’t even make it public 
what we’re really organized to do. 
He continued to crawl, knowing 
that till the fire was out they’d as- 
sume he was probably in the car 
or somewhere nearby. They’d never 
suspect that a man could survive 
a tumble like that and walk or even 
crawl away. Not till they’d 
not found him in the car anyway. 

Besides, he wasn’t a man. 

The doctor’s niece is beautiful, 
he thought hazily, beginning to 
grow tired. The two things hit him 
at once; he was in love with a girl 
he’d only known for a few hours. 

Sleep meant death. He couldn’t 
die now. Not now. 

Up above he could see the 
bridge; beyond that was the tunnel. 
Just up that slope, he thought while 
his head started to spin; and he 
knew he didn’t really want to get 
to the pickup spot because he was 
in love and that was useless and . 
his head began to spin and there 
were people and the world tilted 
upside down and there was noise 
and there was pain. 

The pain wouldn’t stop. It went 
on and on, and he couldn’t think 
while the pain went on. 

P ete opened his eyes slowly and 
stared at the white ceiling 
above him. Then he remembered 
the pain and looked down at his 
body. 

His own gnarled and wrinkled 
arms were crossed over his chest 
He could see his almost useless legs 
curled under the sheet. 



He closed his eyes to hold back 
the tears that he knew would come. 
This was the real Pete; this was the 
way he was and always would be. 
That was engraven bitterly into his 
heart and mind, whether in his hu- 
man or Zombie body. This was a 
hell and a pain far worse than any 
transfer could ever be for him. 

Later, when his eyes had dried, 
he painfully managed himself out 
of bed and into his harness and 
crutches. As he stood up two icchs 
came into the room. 

“Hi ya, Pete!” one of them called 
cheerfully. “We’d sure given you up 
for a goner.” 

Pete stood unsteadily, watching 
him with a killing expression on his 
ugly face, but it was lost in the 
wrinkles and folds. 

“That was some operation that 
you pulled off last night,” the tech 
continued. “I sure wish I could 
qualify for an overcoat. Gosh, but 
you’re lucky!” 

What Pete croaked then wasn’t 
understandable since his larynx had 
been ruined and he couldn’t speak. 
The tone, however, was perfectly 
clear. Then he staggered out of the 
room. 

“What’s with him?” the tech 
asked. 

“Beats me,” replied the other 
tech. “You’d think they didn’t like 
anything or anybody very much the 
way they act most of the time.” 

They shrugged at each other, 
wondering what guys like Pete had 
that enabled them to qualify for 
the overcoats when they couldn’t.

STARCHILD 

by JACK WILLIAMSON and FREDERIK POHL 



Second of Three 



Illustrated by MORROW 



The worlds of men were defenseless 
before the strangest creature ever 
spawned in space — the Starchildl 



VIII 

I f the catacombs of the Machine 
were the nerve center of the Plan 
of Man, then the great State Hall of 
the Planner was its heart. Huge as a 
hangar for jetless spacecraft, ornate 
as a Pharaoh’s tomb, it housed the 
most powerful man in the history ot 



the human race, and it was worthy 
of him. The walls were paneled in 
gold. Crescent-shaped lunettes were 
frescoed with scenes of the nine 
planets and thousand lesser worlds 
on which the Plan of Man reigned 
supreme. 

In the great hall, a score of attend- 
ants waited on the Planner’s will: 



101 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE . 

Machine Major Boysie Gann is assigned to duty on Polaris 
Station, the artificial sun-satellite orbiting far beyond Pluto that 
constitutes one of the Plan Worlds' picket stations protecting the 
inner planets from the Reefs of Space. He discovers that his com- 
mander, Colonel Zafar, is involved in some undercover activity, 
but before he can do anything about it he is captured and ma- 
rooned on one of the Reefs. There he meets a hermit, Harry Hick- 
son, who feeds him, shelters him — and disappears. 

A girl from the Reef settlements, Quarla Snow, rescues him, 
but when he tells her about Harry Hickson she refuses to believe 
him. For she knows Hickson very well . and she knows that 
Harry Hickson has been dead for years. 

Yet there is no doubt in Gann's mind that the man he saw 
is the same Harry Hickson! The mystery is beyond solving for him, 
but it is only one part of a greater mystery. For Harry Hickson is 
linked with the strange religious cult, the Church of the Star, and 
somehow connected with that church is a queer, unbelievable, 
almost legendary figure called the Starchild. Who is the Starchild? 
No one knows. What is the Starchild? No one can say. 

Gann's life in the Reefs does not last long enough for him 
to solve these mysteries. Quarla's father, a doctor, receives a new 
patient, who is Colonel Zafar — dying — rambling deliriously about 
the Starchild and about strange powers. And yet it is not all 
delirium, for something happens that is beyond all Gann's powers 
of understanding: He finds himself falling, falling — and alights 
20 billion miles away, on Earth, in the sacrosanct headquarters 
of the Planning Machine. 

Gann has no idea how he got there. When he is discovered 
by guards, they know no more than he, but they accuse him of 
being the Starchild. Gann protests he is not— that the Starchild 
is only a myth in any event. 

But he learns that the Starchild is no myth. That has been 
proved once and for all. 

The Starchild has sent an ultimatum to Earth, calling on the 
Plan of Man to relinquish its total control over humanity under 
threat of frightful reprisals . and as proof of his powers, the 
Starchild has threatened to extinguish the sun and a dozen near 
stars for a period of time. 

And the threat was made good. Whoever or whatever the 
Starchild is, he has the power to halt the mighty atomic fusion 
engines that fuel the stars! 



102 




his personal physician, three black- 
robed Mechanese acolytes with their 
linkboxes and tonal beads, a dozen 
guards. The Vice-Planner for Venus 
was there, an efficient little engi- 
neer whose nose and ears were out 
of scale, seeming to have come from 
some gigantic donor. So was Ma- 
chine General Wheeler, fixing Boy- 
sie Gann as he entered with a steel- 
gray stare. 

No one spoke. 

Dominating the great hall, on a 
huge golden chair, was the Plan- 
ner himself. He was staring, lost in 
thought, at a great quartz table, on 
which stood scores of fantastic metal 
and crystal toys. 

Gann found himself standing in 
the center of a great tesselated floor, 
alone. His guards had halted behind 
him. He waited for the Planner to 
notice him. 

But the Planner’s eyes were on 
his toys. He sighed and stretched 
out a hand to them, stacking them in 
military rows, as absorbedly as any 
five-year-old with his lead soldiers; 
he formed them in columns and 
marched them across the clean 
gleaming quartz. 

The figures were dragons. They 
were monsters from storybooks, and 
creatures* too incredible ever to have 
been in a story. Some were mirror- 
bright, some black. Many were in 
gorgeous rainbow hues. They had 
no wings, nor had they legs. Their 
heads were the heads of monsters, 
some with teeth like sabers, some 
with curious frayed flower-petal 
faces, like the muzzle of a star-nosed 
mole. 

Boysie Gann had never been so 



close to the Planner before. He 
could not help being a little disap- 
pointed. The Planner was only a 
man! An old, fat, flabby man at 
that — and, thought Gann privately, 
a bit of an eccentric, too. 

Yet the Planner was the voice of 
the Planning Machine itself. It was 
impossible for the Machine to fal- 
ter in its judgments, impossible that 
its chosen instrument be anything 
less than perfect. Of course, there 
were the recurrent rumors about the 
present Planner’s predecessors — old 
Planner Creery, for example, who 
had fallen into error in attempting 
to allow the Reefs of Space entry 
into the Plan of Man under their 
own conditions . Swiftly Gann 
rejected that thought. This was no 
place to be thinking treason! 

He turned his mind to the stab- 
bing pain that had pierced him in 
the anteroom, when he had found 
the girl he loved, Julie Martinet, 
changed into a priestess of the Ma- 
chine, Delta Four. How had it hap- 
pened? Why had it happened? . 

The Planner raised his great round 
head and stared at Boysie Gann. 
“You,” he rasped. “Do you know 
what these are?” 

G ann swallowed and stuttered. 

“Y-yes, sir,” he got out. “1 
mean, I think so. I mean, some of 
them look like pyropods. The crea- 
tures that prey on the life in the 
Reefs of Space, sir — ” 

But the Planner was nodding his 
great bloated head. “Pyropods, yes,” 
he boomed. With a sudden motion 
he swept the delicately carved pieces 
off the quartz table, sent them 



STARCHILD 



103 




crashing to the floor. “1 wish l had 
a thousand pyropods!” he shouted. 
‘‘A million! I wish I could send them 
out to the Reefs to kill and destroy 
every living thing on them! What 
insanity that these reef-rats should 
dare talk to me of freedom!” 

He broke off and glared at Boysie 
Gann, who stood silent, unable to 
speak. The Planner said: “I stand 
for classic truth! What is it that 
animates the Reefs of Space, Gann? 
Tell me, for you have been there. 
It is the romantic fallacy,” he 
roared, not waiting for an answer, 
“the eternal delusion that man is 
perfectible, that there is a spirit of 
goodness that can grow and mature 
in crass organic creatures! What in- 
sanity! And now they threaten me in 
my own Hall — blot out my sun — 
boast of more deadly measures 
still!” He pressed his plump arms 
against the carved golden arms of 
his chair, half lifted himself, leaned 
forward to Gann and shouted : “Who 
is this Starchild, Gann? Is it you?” 
Boysie Gann was galvanized into 
shocked speech. “No, sir! Not me! 
I’ve never seen him. I know nothing 
about him — oh, except what I’ve 
heard here, when General Wheeler’s 
men interrogated me. And a few 
rumors. But I’m not the Starchild!” 
are fh ose rumors. 
Gann? I must know!” 

Gann looked helplessly around 
the great hall. All in it were watch- 
ing him, their eyes cold, their faces 
impassive. He was on his own; there 
was no help for him from anyone 
there. He said desperately, “Sir, I’ve 
told all I know a hundred times. I’ll 
tell it again. I’ll tell you all I know, 



but the truth is, sir, that I know 
almost nothing about the Starchild!” 

“The truth,” boomed the Plan- 
ner, “is what / say it is! Go on! 
Speak!” 

Gann obediently commenced the 
old story. “I was detailed, sir, to 
investigate certain irregularities on 
Polaris Station ...” As he went 
through the long, familiar tale there 
was dead silence in the hall, the 
Planner listening impassively, lean- 
ing on one arm in his great golden 
chair, the others taking their cue 
from him. Gann’s voice fell on the 
enormous hall like words shouted 
down a well. Only echoes answered 
him only the narrowing of an eye, 
the faint shift of a position showed 
that his hearers had understood. He 
finished with his arrest in the cata- 
combs of the Machine, and stood 
silent. 

The Planner said thoughtfully, 
“You spoke of a sign. The sign of 
the Swan.” 

“Yes, sir.” Boysie Gann demon- 
strated as best he could the supple 
mo* mn cf forearm and hand that 
he had seen in Harry Hickson and 
the dying Colonel Zafar. “1 believe 
it refers to the constellation Cygnus, 
in which the main star, Deneb, is 
some sort of object of worship to 
what is called the Church of the 
Star . ” 

T he planner turned his great head 
away from Gann, toward the 
black-robed knot of communicants 
of the Machine. “Deneb!” he barked. 
“Display it!” One of the acolytes 
spoke in soft, chiming tones to his 
linkbox. Instantly the lights in the 



104 



ir 




great hall darkened, and on the 
vaulted ceiling a panorama sprang 
into light. The Planner craned his 
thick neck to stare searchingly up- 
ward. Every eye followed his. 

It was as though the thousand 
yards of earth and rock above them 
had rolled back. They were gazing 
into the depths of space on what 
seemed to be a clear, moonless night 
— late in autumn, Gann judged by 
the position of the constellations; 
perhaps around midnight. Overhead 
were the great bright stars of the 
Summer Triangle, Altair to the 
south, Deneb and Vega to the north. 
The Milky Way banded the vault 
with a great irregular powder of 
stardust. Low on the horizon to the 
west red Antares glowed; to the east 
was Fomalhaut . 

Abruptly the scene began to con- 
tract. It was as though they were 
rushing through space, straight to- 
ward the constellation Cygnus. Fom- 
alhaut and Antares slipped out of 
sight with Sagittarius and Altair’s 
constellation, the Eagle; so did the 
Pole Star and Cepheus below it; 
all that was left was Cygnus, the 
constellation of the Swan, hanging 
over their heads like a bright cano- 

py- 

A voice chimed: “Constellation 
Cygnus. Stars: Alpha Cygrii, also 
known as Deneb, blue-white, first 
magnitude. Beta Cygni, also known 
as Albireo, double, components deep 
blue and orange. Gamma Cygni — ” 

The Planner’s voice cut in rasp- 
ingly: “Just Deneb, idiot! What 

about Deneb?” 

The voice did not miss a beat. 
It chimed: “Deneb, distance 400 



light-years. Surface temperature, 11,- 
000 degrees. Supergiant. Spectro- 
graphic composition, hydrogen, cal- 
cium — ” 

“Planets!” boomed the Planner 
irritably. 

“No planets known,” sang the in- 
visible voice. Gann craned his neck; 
it came from one of the black-robed 
acolytes, but with their faces shroud- 
ed in the hoods he ‘ could not tell 
which. 

The Planner was silent for a long 
time, staring upward. He said at 
last, “Has the Machine any evidence 
of physical connection between 
Deneb and the Starchild?” 

“No evidence, sir,” chanted the in- 
visible voice at once. “Exceptions 
as follows: Possible connection be- 
tween star Deneb and reported 
Church of the Star. Possible connec- 
tion between star Deneb and star 61 
Cygni in same constellation, 61 Cyg- 
ni being one of the stars said Star- 
child threatened to, and did, ex- 
tinguish. Neither of these items con- 
sidered significant by the Machine.” 

The Planner grumbled. “Very 
well. Cancel.” The display over- 
head winked out, the room lights 
sprang up. The Planner sat brood- 
ing for a moment, his eyes remote. 
He stared absently around the room, 
his gaze passing over Boysie Gann, 
over the spilled toys at his feet, over 
the faces of the guardsmen and Ma- 
chine General Wheeler. 

His eyes came to rest on the black- 
robed acolytes. Then he sighed and 
gestured to one of them. It was only 
the crook of a finger, but the figure 
in black at once came toward him, 
holding something in his hand. 



STARCHILD 



105 




It was a length of golden cable 
extending from his linkbox. At its 
end was a golden eight-pronged plug. 

Boysie Gann’s eyes went wide. 

If he was not insane — and no, he 
was not; for already the acolyte 
was stepping to the Planner’s side, 
touching his forehead, sweeping back 
his sparse, unruly hair, baring the 
glittering plate that was set into his 
forehead — the Planner was about 
to undergo communion with the 
Machine! 

T he spectacle was fascinating — 
and frightening. 

Heedless of the eyes on him, the 
Planner sat relaxed while the acolyte 
deftly slipped the golden plug into 
the receptors in the plate on his 
forehead. 

At once the Planner’s expression 
changed. 

His eyes closed. The fretful, 
angry look disappeared. There was a 
second’s grimace, the teeth bared in 
rictus, the corners of the eyes wrink- 
ling in deep furrows, the jaw set. It 
was like a momentary pang of 
agony ... Or ecstasy. 

It passed, and the Planner’s face 
went blank again. 

His breathing began to grow more 
rapid. As the planted electrodes ex- 
cited the secret centers of his brain, 
he began to show feeling. His face 
creased in a smile, then frowned, 
then smiled again, forgivingly. His 
lips began to move. Hoarse, inartic- 
ulate words whispered — slowly — 
then faster, faster. His plump body 
shook, his fingers worked. The black- 
robed acolyte calmly touched his 
arm, whispered in his ear. 



The Planner calmed. His body 
relaxed again. His whispered voice 
stopped. 

The acolyte waited for a second, 
nodded, removed the cable and 
stepped lightly away. 

The Planner opened his eyes and 
looked around. 

To Boysie Gann, the change in 
the Planner was stranger than any- 
thing he had seen on the Reefs of 
Space. A glum, angry, harried man 
had accepted that moment of com- 
munication with the electronic joys 
of the Machine; a cheerful, energetic, 
buoyant one had emerged from it. 
The Planner opened his mouth and 
boomed laughter into the great hall. 
“Ha!” he shouted. “Ho! That’s 
good!” 

He sat up and pounded his great 
fist onto the quartz table. “We’ll de- 
stroy them!” he cried. “Reef-rats 
and Starchild — anyone who dares 
interfere with the Plan of Man. Well 
crush them and their fanciful dreams 
forever. And you’ll help in this, Boy- 
sie Gann, for you are the chosen 
instrument of the Plan in this great 
work!” 

For a lunatic moment Gann 
thought of turning, running, fleeing 
— of leaping toward the Planner and 
letting the decapitation charge in his 
security collar end his problems for- 
ever. There was something wild and 
fearful in the great chuckling good 
humor with which the Planner bub- 
bled now, something that terrified 
Gann. If the Machine could cause 
such personality change in its most 
favored of servants, Gann feared 
the Machine. Feared it! And that 
thought was in itself fearsome to 



106 



IF 




him, for the Machine had always 
been the great good master whose 
judgments were infallible, who al- 
ways rewarded good service, pun- 
ished only the bad. 

Yet this particular reward seemed 
a very terrible punishment to 
Gann . 

But all he said was, “Yes, sir. I 
serve the Plan, sir!” 

The Planner shouted with glee. 
“Serve it well, boy!” he cried. “Serve 
it with all your heart and mind — or 
you’ll serve it with your eyes and 
arms and liver, in the Body Bank! 
We all serve the Plan, boy. In one 
way or another!” And he dismissed 
Gann with a good-humored wave 
of one fat arm, and turned to Gen- 
eral Wheeler. As the guards closed 
in on Gann and marched him out of 
the room he caught one glimpse of 
the general, staring toward him. The 
steel-gray eyes were cold and empty, 
but Gann could read their message. 

Don't fail me, either , Gann , they 
said. 

IX 

T here had once been a time, 
thought Boysie Gann, when life 
was simple and his duty clear. 

In that dead, half-forgotten time 
— was it only months ago? It seemed 
like centuries — and he had found, 
and loved, and won a girl named 
Julie Martinet. He remembered the 
flight they met, remembered their 
long hours together, their endless 
promises, the bright hope of happi- 
ness they gave each other. He re- 
membered the long white beach at 
Uhe Togetherness center at Plays 



Blanca, and her kiss before he left. 
Warms sweet, soft, loving, she had 
been everything a man could want. 
Her memory had followed Boysie 
Gann twenty billion miles out from 
the sun, and her absence had made 
that long voyage bleak. 

Yet never had he been so far from 
her as in this room. 

He could, if he dared, reach out 
and touch the lips he had kissed at 
PI ay a Blanca. 

But the mind behind them was no 
longer the mind -of the sweet, warm 
girl he had loved. The body was the 
body of Julie Martinet, but what in- 
habited it was Sister Delta Four. 

Involuntarily he whispered: “Julie! 
Julie Martinet . .” 

She stood motionless, regarding 
him with grave dark eyes. He 
searched them for some hint of 
recognition, for the saving warmth 
of love that had filled them at Playa 
Blanca, but nothing was there. 

She shook her hooded head. “I 
am Delta Four,” she said, her voice 
a melodious chime. “I am to inter- 
rogate you for the Machine.” 

She stood watching him, waiting 
for a response, her pale face half 
hidden by the deep folds of the 
cowl she wore. The luminous em- 
blem on her black robes mocked 
him. It was a Keep Off sign that 
foe dared not ignore. 

But he could not help saying, 
“Julie, don’t you remember me at 
all? Can’t you tell me what hap- 
pened?” 

She fingered her long string of 
bright black beads, each an electron- 
ic bell that rang when she stroked 
it. “Major Gann,” she sang, her 

ur 



fARCHILD 




voice in perfect pitch with the tonal 
beads, “I am, as you see, an acolyte 
of the Machine. I do not wish to be 
reminded of any other life.” 

“Please, Julie. At least tell me 
why you didn’t wait — ” 

Her grave head nodded. “We have 
time,” she trilled. “Ask your ques- 
tion.” 

“Why didn’t you — I mean, why 
didn’t Julie Martinet wait for me? 
I sent you a letter from Pluto — ” 
“Your message was delivered,” 
she sang. “But Julie Martinet had 
already been admitted to training as 
acolyte for the Machine. She de- 
stroyed your message. She does not 
wish to recall it.” 

“But I loved you!” Gann burst 
out. “How could you turn your 
back on me?” 

The serene pale face stared at him 
without curiosity. “Julie Martinet 
loved you,” she corrected him mel- 
odiously. “I am Delta Four. Please 
sit down, Major Gann. I must in- 
terrogate you for the Machine.” 
Reluctantly Gann sank into a 
chair, watched as she moved another 
chair near his. She seated herself 
with deliberate grace. 

From under the cape she brought 
forth a small linkbox, covered in a 
black plastic, like leather. “Major 
Gann,” she said, “I must ask you if 
you are the Starchild.” Her voice 
was pure melody, cold and perfect 
and remote as her white, oval face. 

Gann snapped: “Plan take it, no! 
I’m fed up with that question! I’ve 
said it a hundred — ” 

But she was shaking her head. 
“Wait,” she broke in. “One moment, 
please.” 



H e watched her glumly, the ache 
of his bruises combining with 
the deeper ache in his heart as, 
hooded head intently bent, she once 
again touched the long string of 
beads. As each electronic chime 
rang out her throat echoed the 
tone, practising the difficult scale 
of tone phonemes that made up 
the artificial language called Me- 
chanese. 

Mechanese was the difficult 
bridge between the Machine and 
the human mind. Earlier computers 
had crossed that bridge by building 
their own structure of translation, 
transforming English into Fortran 
or another artificial tongue, Fortran 
into binary numbers, the binary 
statement into instructions and data 
for processing. The Machine’s lan- 
guage was itself a sort of pattern 
of binary digits that represented its 
own electronic processes — circuits 
open or closed, storage points charg- 
ed or discharged, ferrite cores in 
one magnetic state or another. 

Human beings could not be train- 
ed to speak that binary language, 
nor could the Machine of the Plan 
of Man be troubled with the dull 
task of translation. Instead it had 
created a language that men could 
learn — with difficulty, with a con- 
secration of purpose that required 
them to give up the coarser human 
aspects of their lives, but all ihe 
same with accuracy and assurance. 

Mechanese was a bridge, but a 
difficult one. The Machine, count- 
ing time in nanoseconds, could not 
wait for laggard human speech. Ac- 
curate in every either-or response, 
it had no need of redundancy. It 



108 



IF 



























i 












SSk ^ 











had computed the theoretical capaci- 
ty of the human ear and the human 
voice at some 50,000 binary units 
of information per second, and it 
had deviseci a tongue to approach 
that theoretical maximum. 

Normal human speech conveyed 
only about 50 such bits of informa- 
tion in a second; Mechanese was a 
thousand times more efficient. 

And, Gann knew, it was about 
a thousand times as difficult to 
learn. 

Bitterly he realized that it was 
the very thing in Julie Martinet that 
first drew his attention to her — 
her soft, true voice — that had lost 
her for him forever. The Machine 
sought endlessly for humans who 
could be trained to Mechanese — 
sought them and, when it found 
them, did not let them go. Only 
such special individuals could be 
trained to speak Mechanese well, 
though it was possible for almost 
anyone who invested the time and 
effort to learn a sort of pidgin, or 
to understand it. A true acolyte 
needed not only a wide vocal range 
but a true sense of absolute pitch. 
The tonal beads would help. An 
acolyte could, as Delta Four was 
doing now, use them as a sort of 
pitch-pipe before talking to the Ma- 
chine. But not even they would 
convert an ordinary human into 
one fluent in Mechanese. 

Watching her tolling the tonal 
beads, Gann pictured the long, 
arduous weeks of training. He 
knew it required total concentra- 
tion, absolute devotion. And its ul- 
timate reward was the bright metal 
plate in her forehead. 



Her quick voice trilled a chain ot 
silver bird-notes. The linkbox sang 
an electronic answer. Her alert, emo- 
tionless eyes looked up at him at 
last. 

“We’re ready now,” she said. 
“Major Gann. Are you the Star- 
child?” 

A hundred interrogations, and 
this was the hundred and first. 
Boysie Gann no longer needed 
his mind to answer the girl’s ques- 
tions. Repetition had taught his ton- 
gue and lips to answer by them- 
selves. I am not the Starchild. I 
have never seen the Starchild. I 
know nothing of the Writ of Libera- 
tion. I have never engaged in un- 
planned activities. 

And all the time his heart was 
shouting: Julie! Come back . 
Each time he answered a ques- 
n. Sister Delta Four sang into 
the linkbox. The strange, quavering 
notes sounded nothing like what he 
had said, but he knew that each 
difficult phoneme was also a mean- 
ingful morpheme, each sung syllable 
a clause. And each time she asked 
a question she paused, regarding 
him with detached interest, her per- 
fect face as inhuman as her voice. 

“My tour of hazardous duty took 
me out to the Spacewall . .” he 
said, and went on with the long 
familiar tale. 

He felt the bright gold walls 
pressing in on him, suddenly suf- 
focating. 

He wondered how many thousand 
feet of rock lay above him. Up at 
the surface of the earth, was the 
endangered sun shining now on 



110 



IF 




woods and fields tinted faintly green 
with early spring? Or was there arc- 
tic ice above this isolated, sound- 
deadened cell in the Planner’s vast 
suites? Or miles, perhaps, of dark 
and icy ocean? 

He had no way of knowing. 

And abruptly he felt a wave of 
desperate longing for the Reefs, 
for Freehaven, for Quarla Snow. 
Those strange spaceborne rocks 
were somehow kinder than the Plan 
of Man. He was homesick for in- 
finite space ... for that fantastic 
concept, freedom . 

The stem snarl of the linkbox 
brought him back to his interro- 
gation. “Proceed,” cooed Sister Del- 
ta Four. “You were attacked by 
pyropods?” Her voice was tuneful 
as a crystal bell, cold and empty 
as the black space between the 
Reefs. There was no flicker of feel- 
ing on the serene and secret oval 
of her face. 

He nodded wearily — then, re- 
membering: “Yes, but before that, 

I forgot to mention one thing. Hick- 
son removed my collar.” 

Her brilliant dark eyes did not 
widen. She merely sang into the 
linkbox, still watching him, her eyes 
intent byt somehow blind, as though 
she were already absorbed in her 
private ecstasy of communion. 

The black box snarled. 

“The Machine requires elucida- 
tion,” Sister Delta Four trilled 
sweetly. “We must find this unregi- 
mented Harry Hickson. His knowl- 
edge must be recovered for the 
Plan. Then each organ of his body 
must be obliterated.” 

Gann grinned bleakly at her, look- 



ing at the lips he had kissed so 
long ago. “Sorry. I can’t help you. 
He’s dead.” 

“The Machine rejects this data,” 
she sang. “Did you not ask this un- 
planned man how he removed the 
collar?” 

“I don’t know how,” he admitted. 
He paused, hoping to see some 
living spark in her eyes. But there 
was none. The black box whirred 
ominously. “I think he was a con- 
vert to the Church of the Star,” said 
Gann hurriedly. “I think — that is, 
as I understand it, his power was 
thought to come from Deneb.” 

An angry peal from the linkbox. 
“That is self-evidently false,” sang 
the cool voice of Sister Delta Four. 
“No star possesses any such power 
to share. No mind in the universe 
is more powerful than the Ma- 
chine.” 

She paused, while the black box 
snarled again. “If the falsehood is 
Harry Hickson’s, the truth will be 
extracted when he is captured,” she 
translated sweetly. “If the false- 
hood is yours, Major Gann, you are 
in grave danger of the Body Bank.” 
He cried: “I’m telling the truth! 
I’m loyal to the Plan of Man!” 

The box sang; the girl intoned, 
“The Machine rejects such merely 
verbal assurances. One moment. The 
Machine is receiving additional data 
through another input.” 

Q ueerly, the girl’s voice was fad- 
ing. 

Gann blinked at her. She seemed 
to be moving — dwindling — as 
though she were falling away from 
him, down through the long dark 



STARCHILD 



111 




emptiness of space. It was as though 
Gann were looking at her through 
a zoom lens, pulling away. She re- 
ceded a thousand yards — 

Then she was back. Gann felt a 
moment’s vertigo, as though the 
Planner’s suite down in the bowels 
of the earth were somehow dancing 
a slow waltz. The feeling passed. 

The linkbox whirred menacingly, 
and Sister Delta Four sang, “The 
Machine terminates this interview.” 
A sharp hum from the linkbox. “It 
reminds you that unplanned ideas, 
like unplanned words and unplanned 
actions, must be severely corrected. 
But it reserves judgment on your ul- 
timate disposition.” 

Her white, perfect face was smil- 
ing slightly, perhaps in contempla- 
tion of her instant rapture that was 
soon to come, when the buried elec- 
trodes would excite her brain to the 
incomparable bliss of electronic 
communion. But the linkbox was 
not yet through with her. It buzzed 
again, harshly. 

“The Machine finds your narra- 
tive incomplete,” she recited melo- 
diously, contemplating Gann with 
her dark, serene eyes. “You have 
not identified the Starchild. You 
have revealed no facts about the 
Togethership. You have not accoun- 
ted for the so-called Writ of Libera- 
tion. You have not explained how 
you got into the vault of the Ma- 
chine.” 

Gann shook his head. “I don’t 
know what to tell you,” he said. The 
box whirred implacably. 

“Your statements are inadequate,” 
Sister Delta Four sang again. “But 
the interview is concluded — ” 



There was that surge of unreal 
motion again. Gann gripped his 
chair. This time even the girl felt 
it; her perfect lips opened, her eyes 
shook a flicker of surprise. 

The linkbox twittered urgently. 
At the same moment loud bells and 
sirens began to sound elsewhere in 
the Planner’s warrens. 

“Earth temblors,” the girl began 
haltingly, “have been detected at 
several points — ” 

Then the linkbox crashed out a 
loud, despairing sound. Sister Delta 
Four gasped. Instinctively she reach- 
ed out and caught Boysie Gann’s 
arm. “Pyropods!” she cried. “The — 
The — Oh, you’ve got to help! 
The Planner’s hall has been invaded 
by pyropods! Hundreds of them! 
They’re there now!” 

T he private room in which Sister 
Delta Four had been interro- 
gating Boysie Gann was one tiny 
office in the immense network of 
corridors and chambers that was 
the administrative and living head- 
quarters of the Planner. It had been 
locked, but the door opened instant- 
ly to the pattern of the girl’s finger- 
tips on the knob. It flung wide, and 
Gann and the girl ran through the 
open doorway, into a wide, gold- 
walled hall. Broad as a highway, tall 
as a two-story building, it ran 
straight through the heart of a moun- 
tain, the Planner’s rooms opening 
off it at intervals all the way. It 
was a great ceremonial thorough- 
fare, lined with glittering gold and 
crystal statuary, hung in gold bro- 
cades, paneled with murals and 
viewscreens. 



112 



IF 




And it was filled with the reek- 
ing, choking, dusty smoke of jet ex- 
hausts. 

A scream of some huge rocketing 
body ripping through the air smote 
their ears. A human shout of angu- 
ish — the cries of men taken by 
surprise — the thin, ear-splitting 
volley of laser guns. In all the 
noise and confusion Gann saw one 
thing clearly — saw it, grabbed the 
girl by her arm and pulled her back 
into the shelter of the doorway. 

A pyropod was rocketing toward 
them down the hall. 

It roared at them at a speed near- 
ing Mach One; in the cramped quar- 
ters of the hall the shriek of its 
passage was physically painful, 
deafening. And the look of the thing 
was that of an avenging angel come 
to Earth, set on destruction. 

It was a nightmare come to life. 
Wilder than the most fantastic of 
the Planner’s toys, it was shaped a 
little like a scorpion, larger than a 
charging buffalo. Its eyes were 
great mirrors with stalked receptors 
at the center — natural radio tele- 
scopes, glowing red. Its jaws were 
mighty enough to crunch steel bars. 
Its talons could rip through armor 
plate. Its body was armored with 
darkly shining scales; a long wicked 
saber-like tail was arched over its 
back. And the whole thing was 
screaming through the air of the 
tunnel toward them. 

The girl cried out in fear; Gann 
pulled her head against his chest, 
quieting her — though in truth the 
sound of her terror was lost in the 
earsplitting din of the pyropod’s pas- 
sage. This was no baby, like the one 



Gann had played with on Harry 
Hickson’s reef. It was an armored 
juggernaut, full grown, capable ot 
battling a Plan space cruiser on 
equal terms. 

It passed them and rocketed into 
a group of armed guardsmen, knot- 
ted a hundred yards down the hall. 
They were firing wildly with laser 
and projectile weapons; it struck 
them, passed . and they were 
gone. Only a jackstraw heap of cor- 
pses and stirring near-dead marked 
where they had been. 

“Great Machine!” gasped Sister 
Delta Four, her impeccable serenity 
gone, her black hood thrown back, 
the bright metal plaque blinking out 
of a terrified face; “What was that?” 

“You told me,” snapped Gann. 
“Pyropod! If it comes back, we’re 
dead!” 

She whimpered and tugged at his 
arm. “Back in here — we can hide 
” 

“No! There are others. If one 
finds us this way we don’t have 
a chance. But if I can get a gun — w 

He stared down the broad, long 
hall. The bright jet of the pyropod’s 
tail was out of sight. Perhaps the 
monster had gone into another room, 
or down another hallway. Mean- 
while the guardsmen were still in a 
heap of death. 

He came to a fast decision. “Julie 
— I mean — oh, never mind that 
Listen! These things can be killed if 
you know where to aim. I’m going 
after a gun. You stay in the room!” 
And he was off, running as hard as 
he could, straight down the broad 
hall toward the dying men. He 
fought the temptation to skulk along 



STARCHILD

the sides. There was no conceal- 
ment here. If the creature came 
back, he would be dead; it was 
that simple. His only chance was 
speed. He did that hundred yards 
in Olympic time — 

And it was nearly too slow, at 
that. Gasping, wheezing, his chest 
and muscles on fire, he heard a 
sudden growing volume of sound 
and looked up. 

A howl of sound was coming 
toward him, and behind it, almost 
as fast as the sound itself, a pyropod 
was rocketing at him. 

He flung himself to the floor. 

The thing missed him by inches; 
he caught a quick glimpse of metal 
jaws and crystal tusks, of enormous 
talons reaching out for him; then 
it was past, and he was up and run- 
ning 

114 



He heard the thing crashing, 
smashing, battering into the statu- 
ary and the walls of the hall, stop- 
ping itself at heedless cost, but he 
did not turn. He leaped to the fallen 
guardsmen, caught up a laser gun, 
checked its charge and whirled. 

The pyropod had completed its 
turn. 

It caught Gann in its pulsing red 
headlamps. It was screaming at him,s 
a living battle-rocket. He fired one 
maximum-blast shot into its eye, 
and tumbled to the ground again. 

It screamed in agony as it passed 
over him. It blundered blindly into 
a wall, sideswiped a cluster of statu- 
ary, gouged out a bright streak in 
the hard metal of the corridor. Its 
jet flamed brightly and faded. Gann 
fired one more shot, then covered 
his head with his hands. 

IF 





There was a great distant explo- 
sion. 

He felt the shock wave pass over 
him. Some of the corpses near him 
were stirred by the thrust of it, 
their bleeding limbs flopping wildly, 
their unseeing faces nodding. 

The pyropod was gone. 

But Sister Delta Four had said 
“dozens” of them . 

Quickly Gann stooped to the ab- 
batoir the pyropod had left and 
rummaged for weapons. He dis- 
covered a half-empty laser weapon, 
pocketed a light projectile gun, load- 
ed up with the three heaviest-charge 
laser guns he could find. Then he 
turned to go after Sister Delta Four. 

She was standing just behind him. 
She had seen what he was doing, and 
she had done the same. She held 
two weapons, and in a pouch in her 



robes Gann could see the glitter of 
at least one more. 

He hesitated, then grinned. 

“Come on,” he cried. “Let’s see 
what we can do! Right in the eyes, 
remember!” He clapped her on the 
shoulder, and turned and ran in the 
direction of the Great Hall of the 
Planner. 

A hellish howling and roaring led 
him to it. He needed no other 
signs. 

Before he got there, he destroyed 
two more pyropods, neither quite as 
big as the one that had nearly got 
them in the hall, and Sister Delta 
Four had frightened another off with 
a long-range shot that might 01 
might not have hit. 

The Great Hall of the Planner 
was the mother-hive. It was filled 



STARCHILD 



114 



with the great creatures, ripping 
through the smoky, sulfurous air, 
ripping out boulder-sized bits from 
the walls, from the huge golden 
chair of the Planner, from anything 
that would give them reaction mass. 
They seemed to have conquered 
the human defenders of the Hall 
wnh no trouble, and were fighting 
among themselves over the spoils. 

Then Gann caught the slim ruby 
flash of a laser weapon. 

One of the pyropods bellowed 
with pain, like an air-raid siren 
gone mad. It was not a mortal 
wound, but it must have been an 
agonizing one; the injured creature 
hurtled through the air and collided 
with another feasting beast; the two 
began to slash each other. 

Someone was still alive in the 
room! 

Warning the girl to remain be- 
hind, Gann peered cautiously 
around the door. The laser flash 
had seemed to come from one of the 
decorative niches holding statuary, 
under a painted lunette. Gann took a 
deep breath and shouted, then duck- 
ed back around the door. But it was 
useless. In the monstrous racket of 
the snarling, fighting pyropods his 
voice was unheard. 

He caught Sister Delta Four by 
the shoulder, pulled her close to 
him so that her ear was next to his 
lips. “I’m .going to try to pick 
them off one by one!” he cried. 

“They’re not paying any attention 
right now. I think I can get most 
of them. But if any start this way, 
you shoot right for the eyes!” 

She nodded, her face calm and 
untouched again, the great service 



lasers incongruous in her hands. He 
gave her a last thoughtful glance, 
unable to forget the bright commun- 
ion plate that was now once again 
hidden under the black cowl, then 
turned toward the Great Hall. 

It took him twenty minutes. 

He counted, and there were fif- 
teen of the great beasts rocketing 
and fighting about the hall. He got 
seven of them, one by one, before 
there was any trouble. 

Then at Sister Delta Four’s 
warning touch, he had to turn and 
destroy a lone wanderer, racing 
toward them down the hall. 

Then he got three more, and then 
he noticed that one screamed, burst 
and died at the far side of the hall 
that he had not fired on. 

Whoever was hiding in the niche 
across the hall had seen what he 
was doing, and had copied him. 

'■"T'fiere were two guns firing then 
JL — no, three; for Sister Delta 
Four stepped out beside him and 
helped gun down the last survivors, 
confused and blundering, as the 
walls shook with the creatures’ 
screams and the air grew acrid and 
sickening with their fumes. 

And then they were all gone. 

Hesitantly Gann entered the hall, 
laser guns ready, eyes darting about 
as he picked his way across the des- 
troyed battleground. 

There were distant bellowings 
still. Obviously there were still a 
few strays, elsewhere in the under- 
ground palace of the Planner; but 
most of them were dead in this 
room. He hurried toward his un- 
known ally.

IF 




Machine General Abel Wheeler 
stepped stiffly out of the niche and 
moved toward him. There was a 
hard grin of victory on his face. He 
holstered one gun and thrust out a 
hand with a motion like a piston to 
grasp Gann’s extended clasp. “Well 
done, Major,” he rasped. 

“Thank you, sir. I had helped. 
This is — ” 

The general’s expression did not 
change. “I know Sister Delta Four,” 
he boomed. “You may tell the Ma- 
chine that I commend you, Sister. 
Please contact the Machine now and 
ascertain its condition. I fear this 
attack may have been intended to 
harm it!” 

He grasped Gann’s arm in a grip 
of steel and led him away. “Ugly 
creatures,” he rasped, kicking at one 
enormous ripped cadaver. “Poetic 
justice, you might say. The Planner 
has always been fascinated by them. 
Interesting coincidence that they’ve 
appeared out of nowhere, here in his 
own home grounds.” He glanced 
over his shoulder at Sister Delta 
Four, who was quickly chiming her 
tonal beads, setting up her link- 
box. “See here, Gann. Look at 
this.” 

On the floor in front of the 
niche where General Wheeler had 
taken refuge there was a square of 
thick, creamy paper. “What is it. 

sir?” 

“Pick it up, man! See for your- 
self!” 

There were human voices now, 
coming from the hall. The mighty 
forces of the Plan of Man were re- 
gathering themselves. Order was 
being restored. 



Boysie Gann hesitated. Something 
was wrong. “The Planner?” he ask- 
ed. “Is he — ” He looked around 
the great hall, littered with corpses 
of the invading pyropods and the 
human guards who had been trapped 
there. 

“Not he, Major! Gone this half 
hour. Read that document!” 

Gann, with a feeling that some- 
thing was awry, leaned forward 
and retrieved the paper. He glanced 
at it. 

Then his doubts and uncertain- 
ties dropped out of his mind. This 
paper was strangely familiar. He had 
seen one just like it — twenty bil- 
lion miles away — in the hands of 
the dying Machine Colonel Zafar. 

That had been the document they 
called the Writ of Liberation! 

A nd this one was something al- 
most as earthshaking in its im- 
portance, almost as dangerous to 
the Plan of Man. 

Boysie Gann read swiftly, looked 
up at the silent carved face of 
General Wheeler wonderingly, then 
returned to the paper. 

It was headed, To the Planner, 
and it said: 

To the Planner, or to who- 
ever succeeds him if he is now 
dead. 

You and those who serve 
with you ignored my warning 
and discounted the dimming of 
the Sun. 

I send you now a pack of 
beasts to show that my powers 
can do more than frighten. 
They will destroy much. They 
may yet destroy more. 



STARCHILD 



117 




If I send them again, it will 
not be to the headquarters of 
the Planner — if anything re- 
mains of that to be destroyed. 

The next demonstration will 
occur in the vaults of the Plan- 
ning Machine. 

Gann looked up, his lips taut, 
his eyes narrowed. “The Planning 
Machine !” he said. “General, we 
must tell Sister Delta Four at once! 
This must be conveyed to the Ma- 
chine immediately.” 

The general rasped: “That de- 
cision will be made by me, Major. 
What have you to say for yourself?” 
Startled, Gann said, “Why — I 
don’t know what you mean, General. 
I didn’t have anything to do with 
— ” Then he saw that the general 
was no longer standing with his 
arms at his side. One hand held a 
laser gun again, and it was pointing 
at him. 

“You’re under arrest,” clipped 
General Wheeler metallically. “Do 
not attempt to draw those weapons. 
Do not speak or move.” 

Gann opened his mouth, then 
closed it again. This was the over- 
whelming, culminating insanity of a 
fantastic experience. Himself under 
arrest! 

But for what? 

He dared not even ask. The gen- 
eral’s iron expression showed that 
he meant his orders to be obeyed. 

Behind him, Boysie Gann heard 
the movements of the guards, com- 
ing near — and past them, a distant 
booming. 

He recognized that sound. Anoth- 
er stray pyropod! He forgot his 



orders and cried: “General! There’s 
another one — ” 

General Wheeler rapped: “Be 

silent! I will not speak again! The 
men will take care of your beast!” 
His voice was queerly loud, Gann 
thought even in his confusion — 
almost as though the general were 
speaking not to him, but to the 
roomful of witnesses. 

But he could not help himself. 
He knew what one single pyropod 
could do, knew that even the Plan- 
ner’s guards might not be able to 
cope with it — and knew that in 
that room was the body and heart of 
the girl he loved, even though they 
might be inhabited by the cold, ma- 
chinelike mind of Sister Delta Four. 
He whirled, drew his laser gun and 
was ready as the roar of the pyropod 
shrieked to the door of the room 
and the creature appeared. 

Gann fired at the red eyes. 

The guards were ready too, alerted 
by the sound and by Gann’s quick 
action; they had turned and were 
firing. The creature was caught in a 
dozen bolts of destroying energy. It 
puffed into flame and exploded . 

And between Gann and the door, 
Sister Delta Four, whispering into 
her linkbox, fell silently forward. 
She dropped to the floor and did 
not move, though the linkbox hoot- 
ed questioningly to her. 

“She’s hit!” cried Gann, and 
dropped his weapons, racing to her. 
He caught her up in his arms, 
and stared into her black eyes. 

His hands were covered with 
blood. Along one side of her black 
robes a spreading patch of sticky 
moisture began to seep, clouding 



118 



IF 




the bright electronic symbols, trick- 
ling to the floor. 

There was no heartbeat. 

He raised his eyes, stared vacant- 
ly at the approaching General 
Wheeler. “Is she dead?” he demand- 
ed, unable to take it in. “Was it 
my shot? Or — ” He paused, trying 
to remember. Had there been an- 
other pencil-thin lance of laser 
light coming from his side of the 
room? Had General Wheeler fired 
over his shoulder and shot Sister 
Delta Four? 

But there was no time to think 
of that. The general was on him 
now, his face a metallic mask of 
sternness. “Disarm that man!” 
he rasped to the guards. “Take him 
before the Planner! I accuse him 
of bringing this document here! I 
accuse him of admitting the beasts 
we have destroyed. I accuse him ot 
slaying Sister Delta Four to keep 
her from denouncing him. I accuse 
him of being the Starchild!” 

X 

T he battered veterans of the skir- 
mish with the pyropods, limp- 
ing out of the battlefield and taking 
the swift elevators to the surface, 
found the Planner standing like a 
jovial Santa Claus on a quartz- 
walled balcony, near the snowy sum- 
mit of the mountain in which his 
headquarters was buried. 

This was his eyrie, the great 
crow’s-nest of his palace. He 
chuckled to General Wheeler: “They 
tried to get me and missed! They’ll 
not have another chance! We’ll wipe 
out every last lone rebel.” 



The general rasped: “Sir, here is 
your first traitor! This is the man 
who is responsible. I found him 
bearing this document.” 

Gann cried: “Planner, the general 
is lying! He knows I didn’t — ” 
“Silence!” snapped the general. 
The Planner did not even look at 
Gann. Smiling and nodding, he read 
the square of paper, then dropped 
it negligently to the floor. 

“You’re sure he’s the Starchild, 
General?” he asked. 

“Consider the evidence, sir!” 
rapped the general. “One. He ap- 
peared originally in the vaults of 
the Machine, with no explanation 
of how he got there. Two. At the* 
same time, the Writ of Liberation 
appeared, also unexplained. Three. 
He was bearing this document when 
I apprehended him. Four. He dis- 
played a suspicious knowledge of the 
vulnerable spots on the pyropods 
when his own life was in danger. 
Five. He purposely slew Sister Delta 
Four, making it look like an ac- 
cident, so that she could not speak 
against him. Six. He was about to 
do the same to me when I ordered 
the guards to disarm him. The con- 
clusion, sir, is overwhelmingly indi- 
cated that Machine Major Boysie 
Gann is indeed the Starchild.” 

“But sir — ” cried Gann. The 
Planner gestured, and one of the 
guards wrenched his arm, forcing 
him to be quiet. 

“That’s better,” chuckled the old 
Planner, beaming down on Boysie 
Gann. His dose of communion had 
clearly lasted him a long time; he 
was as bubbling with good humor 
as though the Machine even now 



STARCHILD 



lit 




were shooting pleasure sensations in- 
to his brain. “Yet,” said the Plan- 
ner, smiling good-humoredly at 
General Wheeler, “one of the 
guards reported that it was you, not 
Gann, who killed the sister. Could 
you have been mistaken?” 

“No, sir! Impossible, sir. I had 
no reason.” 

T he Planner nodded cheerfully 
and scratched his plump old 
cheek. He got to his feet and went 
to the quartz wall of his eyrie, 
squinting out into the sunset sky. 
To windward of the summit, the 
descending sun picked out a tower- 
ing crown of cumulus. Beyond the 
crystal parapet, its last rays shimmer- 
ed on a small waterfall and tinted 
the falling slopes of evergreens. 

“As a matter of fact,” the Plan- 
ner added over his shoulder, “Sis- 
ter Delta Four is not dead.” He 
stared smiling down the slopes, 
toward a brown-smogged city be- 
low. “She is now in surgery. Her 
heart was destroyed, but circulation 
was restored before the brain was 
damaged. Even now a donor is be- 
ing provided to replace her lost 
parts.” 

Bovsie Gann cried joyfully: “Plan 
be thanked! Sir, she’ll tell you that 
I knew nothing of the pyropods un- 
til she herself told me about them!” 
“Silence!” rasped General Wheel- 
er. “Guards! Your orders are to 
keep him quiet. I understand do- 
nors are needed for several of your 
wounded comrades. The first man 
who fails to keep the prisoner 
silent will be considered a volun- 
teer 



“Not so fast,” chuckled the 
Planner. “Your zeal goes too far. 
General.” His heavy-lidded eyes 
looked dark and old as the lichen- 
crusted stone below the crystal wall, 
as he gazed benignly toward the 
far city in the smog. “Let us Plan,” 
he said, turning and smiling. “Let us 
decide what to do.” 

The Vice-Planner for Venus 
spoke up promptly: “Double the 
guards in the vaults of the Machine, 
sir. Institute maximum security 
measures, admitting no- unauthori- 
zed person — ” He broke off and 
scratched his enormous nose in 
puzzlement, as he realized that nei- 
ther Boysie Gann nor the pyropods 
had submitted to security check be- 
fore entering the most heavily 
guarded places in the Plan of Man. 

A male acolyte in the black robes 
of the Machine, listening to a sub- 
dued buzzing from his linkbox, 
raised his voice suddenly. “The Ma- 
chine requires the services of the 
prisoner,” he chanted. “The Ma- 
chine instructs Machine General 
Wheeler that the prisoner is not to 
be harmed in any way which will 
affect his memory or his intellect.” 
Wheeler’s expression was that of 
a steel-gray thundercloud. The 
Planner turned toward him, chuck- 
ling. “You have your orders, 
General,” he said good-humoredly. 
“Be sure they are carried out. Do 
you know what those orders are, 
young man?” he added, turning with 
a bland expression of cheer to Boy- 
sie Gann. 

“No, sir. But I stand ready to 
serve the Plan of Man!” 

“Oh, you do indeed,” nodded 

IF 



120 





the Planner. “In a very special way, 
as it happens. Major, you have 
been selected to replace Sister Delta 
Four. The Machine is about to per- 
mit you to receive training in its 
special service as an acolyte — and 
then communion!” 



T he heavy iron security collar 
was not enough for so precious 
an enemy of the Plan as Boysie 
Gann. 

“You’re not just a Risk,” one of 
the guards explained solicitously. 
“See, we can’t take a chance, Major. 
We don’t want to blow your little 
head off. We don’t want to kill you. 
We want to deliver you in one piece, 
right? So just stand still there, while 
we put these cuffs on you . and 
we’ll take you to the training base 
. and then, when the Machine’s 
all finished with you, then we’ll 
blow your head off!” And the guard 
snapped the fetters cruelly tight on 
Gann’s wrists and started him mov- 
ing with a shove. 

They took him to a subtrain- 
station first, and would not answer 
his questions. Was Julie Martinet 
all right? Why had General Wheeler 
lied? What was the Machine going 
to do with him? To each question 
there was only one response: “Shut 
up, you! Move on!” 

But then there was nowhere to 
move. They were in the subtrain 
station, the great cold vaulted shed 
where the enormous electron-flow 
driven globes waited to carry their 
passengers through tunnels in the 
earth, across a continent or under 
a sea. But no globe was moving. 
They brought Gann to a plat- 



STARCHILD 



121 




form, ten security guards forming 
the detail that surrounded him, and 
then they waited. Boysie Gann 
could see that the station was a 
military base, because of the armor- 
ed guard-boxes beside the troughs, 
and because of the black Techni- 
corps uniforms on everyone. That 
was understandable enough; this was 
the depot that served the Planner 
himself, the one nearest his tunneled- 
out mountain retreat But what was 
not understandable was that there 
were neither arrivals nor departures. 

Behind him, a track lock closed 
with a wheeze of leaking air. A 
Togetherness girl froze her automa- 
tic smile as she caught sight of his 
colllar, and hurried past. The guards 
in their radar horns gazed vacantly 
after her. 

“Look,” said Boysie Gann, 
“what’s the matter? What are we 
waiting for?” 

“Shut up, you,” growled a ma- 
chine-sergeant of the guards. But 
he had a worried look. One of his 
men said something to him; the 
sergeant replied in an undertone. 
All Gann could catch was: “ — 
trouble in the tunnels somewhere. 
Now shut up. When they’re ready 
for us, we’ll know.” 

The great forty-foot bubbles wait- 
ed silently in their passage cradles, 
and Boysie Gann stood reganding 
them. Wherever he was going, it 
was probably somewhere far away. 
Short-haul trips were seldom by way 
of the subtrains. The great atomic 
driHs of the Plan had tunneled 
straight-line passages from all major 
centers to all others, sometimes re- 
layed, sometimes piercing nearly 



through the nickel-iron core of the 
Earth itself in a single non-stop 
thrust from Sidney, say, to Calcutta. 
The great freight and passenger 
globes reached speeds so great that 
Coriolis force was their principal 
adversary; the electrostatic hoops 
that banded the evacuated tunnels 
were double and triple strength on 
the side against which the earth's 
potation tended to throw the 
spheres. Via the subtrains, no point 
on Earth was more than a few hours 
away from any other . 

Boysie Gann became aware of a 
confused mutter of excitement, and 
focused his eyes on what was going 
on in the subtrain shed. 

A great dull freightsphere was 
sliding gently into the station, em- 
erging from the mouth of a belt- 
ringed tunnel. 

“About time they got ’em going 
again,” grumbled the machine ser- 
geant. “All right, let’s move out 
They’ll be letting us board now.” 

T he sergeant was right. Within 
ten minutes they were in a sub- 
train globe, settling down in a pas- 
senger compartment. 

But there was a wait of nearly a 
quarter of an hour more before 
Boysie Gann felt the gentle lurch 
that meant they had begun to move. 

His guards were more relaxed, 
now that they were in the subtrain. 
Gann could not very well escape 
them now, not when there was 
nowhere to go but the interior of 
a forty-foot sphere, with nothing 
outside but great electrostatic hoops 
in an airless tunnel, whizzing by at 
speeds of thousands of miles an 




hour. A couple of the guards disap- 
peared, came back with self-satis- 
fied smiles and relieved the others. 
Clearly there was a Togetherness 
canteen on the globe. Even the 
radar-horned sergeant looked some- 
how less inimical, more like a hu- 
man being. 

Above all things, Gann wished 
he knew what had happened to Sis- 
ter Delta Four. There had been a 
moment there, while the pyropods 
were attacking, when she had 
seemed less like a cold-hearted ser- 
vant of the Machine and more like 
the girl he had kissed at Playa 
Blanca. He dreamed of getting her 
back — of somehow winning favor 
with the Machine and receiving the 
great reward of Julie Martinet’s re- 
lease — 

It was only a dream. Considering 
his position now, it was an insane 
one. 

Gann realized that he should be 
devoting every second’s thought he 
could to planning — to trying to 
understand what had put him in 
this position, and what he could do. 
But it seemed quite hopeless. He 
had the giddy sensation that the 
universe had gone mad. From that 
first moment on Polaris Station, 
when he had followed Machine 
Colonel Zafar down to the methane 
snowball, events had carried him 
helplessly along: they made no sense 
to him, but there was nothing he 
could do to help interpret them. 
Their incomprehensibility was in- 
trinsic. It was not that he was 
lacking in comprehension, it was 
that the things which had happened 
were not to be understood in the 



sane, sensible terms of life under 
the Plan of Man. 

He felt a giddy sensation again, 
and this time it was not in his 
mind. 

Boysie Gann leaped to his feet 
in alarm. He could not help think- 
ing of the strange queasiness that 
had preceded his twenty billion mile 
drop into the Planning Machine’s 
catacombs — the same, sensation, 
just before the pyropods struck — 

But this was not the same thing 
at all. The lurching, twisting sensa- 
tion he felt was simply explained. 
The subtrain car had come to a 
stop. It was hanging now, spinning 
slowly, between the charged hoops 
of its airless tunnel. 

If Gann had been in any doubt, 
the cries from outside his room, 
the shouts of guards within, re- 
moved that doubt quickly. Every- 
one on the subtrain globe seemed 
to be shouting at once. “What’s the 
matter?” “We’ve stopped!” “Great 
Plan, we’re a couple of hundred 
miles down! The temperature — ” 
“Help me! Let me out of here!” 
The voices were a confused babble, 
but they all had in common the 
warning knife-edge of panic. There 
was terror on that subtrain car — 
terror that could not be calmed with 
words, for its base was all too real. 

The machine sergeant compre- 
hended the situation at once. With 
a jerk of his radar-horned head he 
bawled at his squad : “Come on, 
outside! Those sheep’ll stampede if 
we don’t keep ’em in line!” 

Boysie Gann was left alone. Out- 
side he could hear the Technicorps 
guards shouting orders at the terri- 



STARCHILD 



123 




fied travelers on the subtrain. No 
one seemed to know what had hap- 
pened. They had stopped, that was 
all. Hundreds of miles below the 
surface of the earth, the rock outside 
hot enough to melt aluminum, the 
pressure great enough to crush dia- 
monds into dust if the electrostatic 
hoops ever faltered — they were 
stopped. Whatever it was that had 
disrupted the service before they 
left the station was probably dis- 
rupting it again. 

The only difference was that now 
they were where no help could ever 
reach them, where if the fields in 
the hoops failed they would be 
dead in the least fraction of a sec- 
ond — where even if the field main- 
tained itself they would be dead in 
a few days of asphyxiation, unless 
they could move. 

Then, abruptly, there was another 
lurch, and they were moving again. 

As the great forty-foot sphere 
gathered speed and stability, Boy- 
sie Gann became aware that he had 
been hardly breathmg. There was 
a great cry of thanksgiving from 
the people outside his room. One 
by one his guards came back, chat- 
tering and laughing, seeming al- 
most human. They did not include 
him in their conversation, but they 
did not go out of their way to keep 
him out. One of them even disap- 
peared for a few minutes, then 
came back with a tray of drinks 
from the Togetherness canteen . 

And then the great globe shook 
again. Shook — crashed into 
something that shrieked of destroy- 
ed metal — slammed to a jolting, 
smashing stop. 



Gann and the guards tumbled 
across the room, hurled against the 
wall like thrown gravel. 

Boysie Gann heard screams and a 
rending sound of the metal of the 
great sphere being crushed. “We’ve 
had it!” someone shrieked. “The 
fields have failed!” — and as he 
went deep into black oblivion, not 
yet feeling pain but knowing that 
he was bleeding, he had struck the 
wall too hard to get up and walk 
away, Gann had time for one last 
thought: He’s right, thought Gann; 
this is the end. 

— When, some indeterminate 
time later, he opened his eyes and 
found himself still alive, he was al- 
most disappointed. 

G ann was in an emergency hos- 
pital. Stiff white bandages 
covered part of his eyes; his head 
ached as though a corps of drum- 
mers were using it for practice; he 
could see, under the shadow of the 
bandages, that one arm was encased 
in a balloon-cast. 

But he was alive. 

A Togetherness nurse was bend- 
ing over him. He said clearly, “I 
thought the tube collapsed.” 

“Hush,” she said gently. “It did. 
But you were almost at the surface, 
and the wrecking squads dug you 
out.” 

“Almost at the surface?” He 
squinted past her, at the second 
figure standing by his bed. For one 
crazy instant on waking he had 
thought it was the Angel of Death 
come to take him away. Now he 
saw it was an acolyte of the Ma- 
chine, the linkbox in her hand, 



124 



IF 




whispering tinkling notes to the mi- 
crophone it contained. “I — I guess 
I’m at the training center,” he said. 

The nurse nodded. “Sleep if you 
can,” she ordered. And Boysie Gann 
was glad to comply . 

For three days Boysie Gann had 
the status of a convalescent. It was 
a considerable improvement over his 
status as a major public enemy. 

The immediate guard detail was 
withdrawn — several had been kill- 
ed in the tube implosion and were 
going through the messy business 
of resuscitation and repair at f he 
Body Bank. Gann was free to wan- 
der within the limited confines o! 
one wing of the hospital in which 
he was a patient. 

He was even allowed access to 
the recreation lounge, run by a 
young Togetherness girl who re- 
minded him of Quarla Snow. Her 
disposition was like Quarla’s, too. 
She did not seem conscious of his 
collar. Most important, she let him 
watch the news-screens to his 
heart’s content. 

Boysie Gann had been away from 
Earth, off on the Reefs or in inten- 
sive custody for so long that he 
had lost touch with the running 
news stories. 

He sat and dreamed. 

What was happening on the 
screen soaked slowly into his mind 
and heart. He watched, and loved, 
the gold-haired, long-legged chorus- 
es of Togetherness girls cooing their 
gentle threats: “Work for the Plan! 
Live for the Plan! You don’t want to 
go to Heaven and make spare parts 
for the Plan!” Though he knew his 
ob;'*;ces of winding up in the Body 



Bank called Heaven and making 
“spare parts for the Plan” must be 
rated pretty high, there was no 
tear in what the girls were sinking. 
It was a part of a life that he had 
lost, and he wanted it back. 

Above all he wanted to find 
himself again. 

Boysie Gann could not recognize 
himself in the enemy of the Ma 
chine who had been castigated by 
the Planner himself, denounced by 
Machine General Wheeler, interro- 
gated by Sister Delta Four. Tha* 
Boysie Gann was a creature who 
had been born on Polaris Station, 
a man who lived with undead Reef 
rats and queer creatures called 
spacelings and pyropods. Gann 
could not fit the strange rebellious 
shape of this other Boysie Gann 
into his personality, could not add 
the two identities and produce a 
vector sum of his future life . 

He sat up straight and glared 
at the view-screen. 

He had been watching a world- 
wide news broadcast with half his 
mind, hardly conscious of what he 
saw, although in fact what he saw 
was exciting enough. The news 
broadcast with almost a catalogue of 
disasters — a crashed Plan cruiser 
that destroyed half a city, earth- 
quakes in Antarctica, a runaway 
nuclear reactor on the Indian sub- 
continent. And then there had been 
a nearer disaster. The screen had 
shown the very subtrain catastrophe 
that had put him in this place. 

And called it sabotage! 

Gann blinked. He hardly recog- 
nized the accident. The bland fat 
Technicolonel puffing out his gruff

charges of criminal conspiracy 
seemed to be talking about some 
other disaster, on some other world. 
Malicious sabotage? A bomb planted 
in the subtrain to discredit the 
Planner and the Planning Machine? 

Most incongruous of all — him - 
self as the arch-villian, with the 
radar-horned guard sergeant as his 
accomplice? 

Gann put down his glass of vi- 
tamin-laced fruit juice and hobbled 
over to the Togetherness girl in 
charge of the lounge. 

He was shaking. “Please,” he beg- 
ged. “Did you see that? What is it 
all about?” 

She scolded him sunnily. “Now, 
now! Your duty under the Plan 
is to get well! You must prepare 
yourself to return to serve — no 
questions, no worries — nothing 
but healing and rest!” 

He said with difficulty, “It said 
on the newscast that I was responsi- 
ble for the subtrain accident. It 
isn’t so! And the guard sergeant who 
was in charge of me — what hap- 
pened to him?” 

Her large, clear eyes darkened 
for a moment in puzzlement. But 
only for a moment. She would not 
question her orders; if her orders 
said that she was to care for an 
enemy of the Plan, she would care 
for an enemy of the Plan. She 
ahook her head and, smiling, led him 
back to the couch. “Drink your 
Juice,” she said with playful sever- 
ity, and would say no more. To her, 
what the Plan of Man ordained was 
necessarily right and true — because 
"right” and “truth” were defined 
by the Plan of Man. 



Or so thought Boysie Gann. 

So thought Boysie Gann, and was 
aware in some part of him that 
there was something in that thought 
which was dangerous — dangerous 
to him and to all mankind, for if 
the sweet and empty-headed To- 
getherness girl accepted the Plan so 
unquestioningly . 

He could not put the thought 
together. It almost seemed as though 
he himself, and General Wheeler, 
and even the Planner — as if all 
the human race within the Plan were 
in some sense no less empty-headed 
than a Togetherness girl. 

But he could not complete the 
thought. And then time ran out and 
he no longer had leisure for such 
thoughts, for he began the course 
of training that would lead him 
to communion with the Machine.

Ternary relation: / hate spinach 
except when it is well washed. Qua- 
ternary relation: I hate spinach ex- 
cept when it is well washed because 
the sand gets in my teeth. 

With instructor and book, with 
constant subliminal tapes droning 
while he slept and teaching ma- 
chines snapping at him awake, Boy- 
sie Gann began to learn the calcu- 
lus of statement, the logic of re- 
lations, the geometries of Hilbert 
and Ackermann and Boole. Con- 
junctions and disjunctions, axioms 
and theorems, double negations and 
metastatements . they all surged 
through his brain, nesting with des- 
tructive dilemmas and syllogisms in 
the mood of Barbara. He leaned 
to transpose and commute. He

IF 





learned the principle of exportation 
and the use of dots as brackets. He 
learned the unambiguous phrasing 
and inflectionless grammar of ma- 
chine programming; he learned the 
distinction between perceptual sym- 
bols and motor symbols, and learn- 
ed to make the auditory symbols 
that bridged the gap. For hours 
with an oscillator squeal beeping in 
his ear to guide him, he sang end- 
less quarter-tone scales. He studied 
the factorization problems of the 
General Problem Solver and learn- 
ed to quantify relationships. He 
learned the construction of truth 
tables, and how to use them to track 
down tautologies in a premise. 

There were neither classes nor 
schoolrooms, there was only study 
and work. It went on and on, end- 
lessly. Gann woke to the drone of 
the tape-recorded voice under his 
pillow, ate with the chime of sonic 
bells in his ear, fell exhausted into 
his bed with schematics of shared- 
time computer inputs racing through 
his mind. 

There was a world outside the 
training center, but he had lost 
touch with it completely. In stolen 
moments he caught snatches of con- 
versation between his few human 
contacts — the Togetherness girls 
who served him at table, the guards 
who roamed the halls — that his 
mind was too hard-pressed to fit to- 
gether. The Starchild. The Writ of 
Liberation. Disasters under the 
earth, rocket explosions in space. 
They did not matter; what mattered 
was null hypotheses and probabilis- 
tic calculus. If he had time enough, 
and thought enough, to probe be-

! yond the demands of the training, 
his mind always reached one step 
ahead — to the moment when train- 
ing was over and he would receive 
the metal badge of communion in 
his flesh — and it recoiled, and re- 
turned to Hilbert and Boole. 

When the course was over, Gann 
did not realize it. 

He went to sleep — exhausted, 
as he was always exhausted in 
this place. He tumbled into the 
narrow, hard bed in the solitary, 
tile- walled room. The voice under 
his pillow promptly began to recite 
to him: 

“ — generate a matrix K, ultili- 
zing the mechanisms of associative 
retrieval to add contextual relation- 
ships to coordinate retrieval. Let 
the i-th row and /- th column show 
the degree of association — ” 

Some part of him was taking it 
in, he knew, but his conscious mind 
was hardly aware of it. All he was 
aware of was his own inadequacy. 
He would never match the pure, 
crystalline tones of Sister Delta Four 
and the other acolyte; he did not 
have the voice for it. He would 
never grasp and retain all the in- 
formation theory and programming 
he had been taught; he did not have 
the training for it . 

He drifted off to sleep. 

He was barely aware that some- 
thing was wrong — some new scent 
in the atmosphere, some hardly per- 
ceived whisper of motion, as though 
someone were waiting outside his 
room for him to be asleep. 

Then the anesthetic gas that had 
been piped through his pillow took 
effect. He slept. Deeply. 



When he woke he felt a minor 
but nagging ache in the skin and 
the bone of his forehead. 

He was in another room — 
green-walled, surgical. 

He did not have to touch his fore- 
head to know that while he slept 
the surgeons had been at work, the 
hair-thin electrodes slipped into the 
micrometrically located centers of 
his brain, the bright badge of com- 
munion implanted on his brow. 

I n the mammalian brain exist 
bundles of nerves and specialized 
tissue which control mood and emo- 
tion, as well as those which control 
motor activities, homeostatic regu- 
lation, conscious thought and the 
various other activities of that three- 
pound mass of hypertrophied tissue. 

One such area is the pleasure 
center. Slip a fine platinum electric 
into it by stereotaxic surgery. Feed 
it a carefully measured, milliampere- 
tiny surge of electricity. The result 
is ecstasy! Fit a laboratory animal 
with such an electrode and with a 
key it can operate, and it will go 
on pressing the key, pressing the 
key, pressing the key ... it will 
not pause for food or drink or fear 
. it will sear itself with delight 
until it collapses of exahustion, and 
wake only to press the key once 
more. 

The jolt of ecstasy that tore 
through Boysie Gann’s being in that 
first moment of awakening with the 
communion plate in his forehead 
and the electrodes embedded in his 
brain was like nothing he had ever 
imagined. It was taste, feeling, odor 
and light; it was the wild delight

IF 




of sex and the terrifying joy of 
daredevil sport; it was all the things 
he had ever known at once, magni- 
fied unbearably. Time stopped. 

He was adrift in a turbulent sea 
of sensation . 

Eons and lifetimes later, he be- 
came conscious of humanity again. 
He was back in his body. The tides 
of quintessential pleasure had re- 
ceded from around him, and left 
him aching and dry. 

He opened his eyes, and saw a 
Technicorps medical orderly re- 
treating from him, the communion 
probe wires in his hand. 

He had been cut off from the joy 
of the Planning Machine. 

Gann took a long shuddering 
breath and reconciled himself to 
being human again. He could under- 
stand Sister Delta Four. He could 
accept his destiny in communion 
with the Machine. No other reward 
could be half as great as this, no 
other purpose as important — 



Dazedly he became aware that 
something was wrong. 

The Technicorps man’s face was 
pale with fear. Voices shouted from 
outside, and one of them was queer- 
ly familiar. 

Gann struggled to his feet, ap- 
prehensive and wary. 

When the door burst open it was 
Machine General Wheeler who came 
into the room like a raging typhoon. 
“Gann!” he roared. “Starchild! You 
devil, what have you done?” 

“I? Done? Nothing, General — 
and I’m not the Starchild, I swear 
it!” 

“Filth!” howled the general. 
“Don’t lie to me! What have you 
done to the Planning Machine?" 

Gann started to reply, to defend 
himself. The general gave him no 
chance. “Lies!” he raged. “Starchild, 
you’ve destroyed us all! Admit it! 
Admit that it was you who has 
driven the Planning Machine hope- 
lessly madl”
