THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

NOTES 



J UNE editorial called on au- 
thors to offer interesting 
aliens, not just tentacled ones. 
Offered examples like rackabore 
— animal with two short side legs 
adapted to hillside living, but too 
specialized because left- and 
right-legged can’t turn in opposite 
direction. Amplifies Robert A. 
Heinlein: “In southern Missouri 
where I was born we have two 
local varieties, the Hillside Snee 
and the Sidehill Murk, which 
have solved the problem of how 
to turn around. They have very 
large mouths — when closely pur- 
sued, they open same quickly, 
jump through, turning themselves 
inside out, and thus can reverse 
direction. This works just fine 
with the Snee, which is smooth- 
skinned. Unfortunately the Murk 
is fuzzy curly; once the fuzz is 
inside, it tickles poor beastie and 
he has a tendency to laugh him- 
self to death, unless he again re- 
verses quickly. The Murk is thus 
rapidly becoming extinct.” 

Raise a collection? They’re fun. 
Like Fund for Widow of Un- 
known Soldier — went over the 
top till spoil sported. And recent 
classified ad saying, “This is your 
last chance to send $1 to” and 
named nothing but a box number; 
people did send their buck. 



J. F. Bone in town not long 
ago. Veterinarian prof at U. of 
Oregon, thinks of self as short, 
tubby, absent-minded — could 
snatch horns off charging water 
buffalo, forgets nothing — not a 
thing. Got onto subject of aliens 
and animals; what else with a 
vet? Mentioned above and alliga- 
tors in N. Y. C. sewage system. 
Got same damned skeptical laugh 
as when showing an egg can’t be 
crushed between hands if held 
lengthwise — no one has ever done 
it and principle is being worked 
into new building materials. 

Explanation of alligators in 
N. Y. C. sewage system: baby 
alligators cute and tiny, but the 
things grow, get flushed away. 
Doc Bone thoughtful, realized 
food plentiful, temperature great 
— blend of hot and cold water, 
no winter wind; they should pros- 
per. They do. 

Bone solved lion-versus-tiger 
controversy in return for fascin- 
ating info on alligators. One lion, 
one tiger, dead lion — tiger bigger, 
heavier, smarter. Six lions, six 
tigers, six dead tigers, most or 
all lions alive — tigers hunt singly; 
lions gang up, would take each 
tiger in turn. 

Doc Bone went on to claim 
membership in club of vets who

have spayed male cats — once. 
Horrible feeling, he says, fishing 
around in welter of sweat. Fast 
look; owner said spay but didn’t 
know sex of cat. Stitch, alter, 
charge double for ghastly mo- 
ment, check carefully ever after. 

I looked closely; memory of the 
ghastly moment still had him 
sweating. Evidently not an ex- 
perience one gets over readily. 

Neither is extrapolating sew- 
age systems after accumulation of 
high-interest data and then find- 
ing it all go down the drain. 
Reason later. Data: 

Detergents, first breakthrough 
in cleansing agents since discov- 
ery of soap, reported on here 
some while ago as coming out of 
mains in mile-long, house-high, 
unbustable bubbles. Hose crews 
needed on 24-hour duty till bub- 
ble problem solved. 

Fine, steady uptrend in sewage 
engineering that would let a fel- 
low take a sound flying guess into 
the future. Now? Pow! How? In 
a minute. 

Ancient cities limited in size 
by sanitation facilities. Rome’s 
Cloaca Maxima caused first popu- 
lation explosion. Sewer chases 
popular in books, films, TV shows. 
Skip all that to short while ago. 
Sterilized sludge first-rate topsoil 
— for Park Department. Methane 
gas by-product hot competitor 
against natural or illuminating 



gas — but rigid restrictions on sale. 

Put sewage in private hands, 
I’d have said. There’s a fortune 
in it. 

But not now. Radioactive 
wastes? Nope, they’re barred. The 
wonder drugs — antibiotics, tran- 
quilizers, steroids and so forth — 
it’d take a miracle of extrapola- 
tion to figure effects on topsoil 
manufacture, deep-sea farming 
and other such marvels that free 
enterprise might have plumbed. 

Will situation settle down? 
Doubtful — all breakthroughs like 
ones in drugs create more break- 
throughs. Still, there might be 
some in sanitation engineering; 
busting the detergent bubble was 
one. (Wonder how they did it, but 
no use querying them now. Them? 
Oh, forgot to mention Dept, of 
Sanitation has a publicity section. 
Private ownership, though, and 
there’d have been a seat on the 
Exchange, advertising campaigns, 
maybe a TV show called, say, 
“The Man from Flushing.”) 

Home again in Oregon, Dr. 
Bone wrote that his daughter, 16, 
thinks he’s unplugged and I’m 
UHF. My son, 18, thinks other 
way round. Wrote back that this 
damage to parental self-esteem is 
inexcusable in modem civiliza- 
tion, suggested organized Teen 
Exchange, to begin the minute 
teeners know everything except 
why their parents are so cubic, to

end the minute they outgrow it, 
with enough visits in between to 
see that this is the best possible 
arrangement. 

Maybe it is at that. 

What did I have in mind here? 
— “Everytime someone says, ‘I 
don’t believe in theories,’ a theory 
dies. Do you believe in theories?” 
— “The cat comes on little fog 
feet.” 

Every writer has things like 
that in his idea file, like lady 
author who woke in great excite- 
ment, scribbled, went back to 
sleep — the cosmic discovery was 
safe — and read in the morning: 
“Hoggimus, higgimus, men are 
polygamous; higgimus, hoggimus, 
women monogamous.” 

Note on the koala story. Oh, 
yes! Man with very tired voice 
phoned one evening; he worked 
for Railway Express and had a 
koala for me and what was the 
best way to my address? I said, 
“A what?” and he wearily read 
off name and address of consign- 
or, a woman in Australia, my 
name and address and amount 
of insurance — $10,000. I poked 
for a break in the story, but there 
was none; all heavily insured 
items were accompanied, he had 
done it for 15 years, and he’d de- 
liver in the morning. I asked why 
would anybody send me some- 
thing insurable at $10,000 and 
how was I to feed the pickiest 



eater on Earth? He said his job 
was to make the delivery, not do 
detective work, and he had a 
supply of food for the koala for 
a few days. 

I called Willy Ley, who agreed 
that eucalyptus leaves were a 
problem, but koalas couldn’t le- 
gally be shipped out of Australia 
and was I sure this wasn’t from 
Mexico, where they were being 
bred? The insurance? Entirely 
possible — getting a koala safely 
Vi around the world is quite a 
trick. Asked to be kept informed. 
I said sure. 

Man phoned, had checked into 
hotel, shaved, eaten. Very tired. 
Would I take delivery that night 
so he could get home to family 
in Calif.? I said sure. Would I pay 
for taxi so he could make certain 
train? I said sure, kept Ley in- 
formed. 

Phone again. Right downstairs, 
big battle with taxi driver — koala 
had messed upholstery, would I 
— I said bring up driver and I’d 
take care of everything. Called 
Ley. He said, “Oh, ho! A koala 
wouldn’t mess — hard and dry, 
like a goat’s. You won’t see the 
man, but if — ” I said sure. No 
man, no koala, natch, but beauti- 
ful detail work, except that last 
bit, and fine acting. My compli- 
ments, and my thanks for a fun 
evening.

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



P OURING sweat and breath- 
ing, shallow, I burned east 
on U.S. Twenty at ninety 
miles an hour, wishing I could suck 
into my lungs some of the wind that 
howled across the windshield. 

I heard the siren in my phones. 
I glanced out the left side of my 
helmet to find a blue-clad figure on 
motorcycle looming up beside me, 
waving me toward the shoulder. A 
law-abider to the last gasp of as- 
phyxia, I braked my little green 
beast over to the berm. The state 
cop angled his bike across my left 
headlamp and stalked back to 
where I sat, tugging a fat book of 
traffic-tickets out of his hip pocket. 

“Unscrew that space-helmet, 
Sonny,” he said. “You’ve just been 
grounded.” 

“Grounded, I’ll grant,” I said, 
my voice wheezing from the 
speaker on the chest of my suit; 
“but I can’t take off the fishbowl, 
officer.” 

“Then maybe you’d better climb 
out of your flying saucer,” the 
policeman suggested. “And if 
you’re toting pearl-handled ray- 
guns, just leave ’em hang.” 

I got out of the car, keeping my 
hands in view, feeling like the fu- 
gitive from space-opera this cop 
evidently took me for. He examined 
me the way a zoologist might ex- 
amine the first live specimen of a 
new species of carnivore; very in- 



9 



terested, very cautious. After ob- 
serving the cut of my wash-and- 
wear plastic sterility-suit — known 
to us who wear them as a chastity- 
suit — the policeman walked 
around me to examine my reserve- 
air tank, which is cunningly curved 
and cushioned against my spine so 
that I can lean back without court- 
ing lordosis. He inspected the bub- 
ble of plastic that fit over my head 
like the belljar over a museum 
specimen, and stared at the little 
valve on the left shoulder of my 
suit, where used air was wheezing 
out asthmatically. “I guess fallout 
has got you bugged,” he said. 

“Not fallout, bacteria,” I ex- 
plained. “I’m one of the Lapins 
from Central University.” 

“That’s nice,” the policeman 
said. “And I’m one of the Bjorn- 
sons, from Indiana State Police 
Post 1-A. What were you trying to 
do just now, break Mach One on 
wheels? Or do you maybe come 
from one of these foreign planets 
that don’t know the American 
rules of the road?” 

I breathed deep, trying to find 
myself some oxygen. “I was born 
right here in Indiana,” I said. 
“The reason I’m wearing this suit 
and helmet is that I’m bacterio- 
logically sterile.” 

“So maybe you could adopt a 
kid,” Officer Bjornson suggested. 

“Sterile like germ-free,” I said. 
“Gnotobiotic. I grew up in the Big 
Tank at Central University.” 



YOU’LL spend the night in 
the big tank at South Bend 
if you’re snowing me, Sonny,” he 
said. “Let’s see your driver’s li- 
cense.” I got my billfold out of the 
glove-compartment — a chastity- 
suit doesn’t have any pockets — 
and handed my license to Bjom- 
son. “John Bogardus, M.D.,” he 
read. “You’re a doctor, eh? This 
says you live at BICUSPID, Cen- 
tral University, South Bend. 
Whafs that BICUSPID, Doc? 
Means your practice is limited to 
certain teeth?” 

“I’m a resident in pathology, and 
I’m damned near out of air,” I said, 
annoyed at the prospect of suffo- 
cating while acting straight-man to 
a state cop. “BICUSPID is the 
acronym for Bacteriological Insti- 
tute, Central University Special 
Projects in Infectious Disease. I’m 
a Lapin, which is a human guinea- 
pig. I’m sorry, officer, that I broke 
the Indiana speed-limit but my 
air-filter is clogged with condensa- 
tion. If I don’t get back to the Big 
Tank at the University within the 
next few minutes, I’ll run out of air. 
And you’ll have to spend the rest 
of the evening testifying before St. 
Joseph’s County Coroner.” 

“So what happens if you crack 
open your space-helmet and 
breathe the air us peons use?” he 
asked. 

“Pretty quick, I’d die,” I said. 
“I’ve got no antibodies, no physio- 
logical mechanism to combat in- 



10

spired or ingested bacteria.” 

“That’s the sort of answer that 
makes my job the joy it is,” Bjorn- 
son said. “Next thing you know, 
I’ll be chasing drunken drivers 
from Mars.” 

“There’s no intelligent native 
life on Mars,” I said. 

“You think maybe there are in- 
telligent natives on U.S. Twenty?” 
he asked, returning my license. 
“Okay, Doctor Bogardus, I’ve 
bought your story. You leadfoot 
your bomb along after me, and 
we’ll hit the Central campus like 
we’re crossing the payoff line at the 
Mille Miglia.” Bjornson cowboyed 
into the saddle of his bike, spurred 
it off and cut siren-screaming 
down the concrete toward South 
Bend and Central U. I jumped 
back into my sports-car and tailed 
him, the wind soaring past my 
’phones like rocket exhaust. We 
cut through the field of Sunday 
drivers in a horizontal power-dive. 
I was half-blinded by the sweat 
condensed on my air-cooled face- 
plate. Formaldehyde bath or no, 
I’d have to cut in my reserve-air 
pretty soon. 

W E made it while I was still 
breathing. I braked in front 
of the BICUSPID entrance and 
walked as fast as I dared, dizzy 
and panting with the concentration 
of C0 2 bottled up with me in my 
chastity-suit. Outside the door to 
the contaminated labs, I shook 



Bjomson’s hand and told him that 
I considered the expense of my 
Gross Income Tax justified by his 
employment. I went inside then, 
climbed the steel steps to the glass- 
walled shower. I cut in my suit- 
radio and announced my arrival. 
“Bogardus here. I’m nearly out of 
wind; my filter’s soaked. I’m cut- 
ting in reserve-air. Anybody around 
to see that I scrub behind my ears?” 

Dr. Roy McQueen, Director of 
BICUSPID, came out of his office, 
where he’d monitored my an- 
nouncement from the loudspeaker 
set above his desk, and faced the 
glass door of the shower room. He 
waved to me and cut on his micro- 
phone. “Okay, Johnny,” he said. 

I sealed off my air-filter and cut 
in the reserve-air. That canned 
wind felt to my lungs like cold 
beer to the throat on a July day. 
I felt the oxygen percolating 
through me to my toes and finger- 
tips, tingling them back to life. 
Turning on the detergent shower, 
I sloshed around beneath it, wash- 
ing the outside dust off my chas- 
tity-suit. 

“You’re dry by the tank,” Dr. 
McQueen said into his hand micro- 
phone. 

I picked up the long-handled 
shower brush and scrubbed back 
there. I showered the suit’s arm- 
pits, the folds behind the knees, 
the soles of the suit’s boots, scrub- 
bing hard with the brush. “You’re 
all wet, Johnny,” the Chief said. 



WORLD IN A BOTTLE

“Got enough air for half an hour 
in the bathtub?” 

“Yes, sir,” I said, checking the 
gage of my reserve-air tank. Hav- 
ing scrubbed off most of the flora 
I’d picked up in the great wild 
world of Indiana, I climbed down 
through the manhole into the bath- 
tub, a sump of formaldehyde solu- 
tion eight feet deep. I sat on the 
iron bench at the bottom to soak. 
“How about switching on some 
music, Chief? I didn’t think to 
bring anything waterproof to read.” 

“You’ll hear music from me,” Dr. 
McQueen said. “This is a big day 
for BICUSPID, Johnny. It’s the 
first time one of you kids ever 
came home from a date with a 
police escort. What happened? 
Anne’s old man decide he didn’t 
want a plastic-wrapped son-in-law? 
He call the law to throw you off his 
front porch?” 

“My air-filter got bolixed,” I ex- 
plained into the microphone, “so I 
leaned on the gas pedal pretty 
heavy on the way home. A friendly 
gendarme named Bjornson turned 
up.” 

“You should be more careful, 
Johnny. I’d hate to have to post 
you.” Like the rest of us, Dr. Mc- 
Queen did post-mortems on the 
germ-free animals who died of old 
age or stir-fever in the Big Tank, 
or had to be sacrificed as routine 
sterility controls. Last winter, for 
the first time, the Chief had had to 
autopsy one of us Lapins. 



Poor Mike Bohrman had gone 
off his rocker and stripped off his 
sterility-suit in the snow. All we 
wear underneath is a pair of 
shorts. That’s the way Mike had 
run around, almost naked in a 
northern Indiana February. It was 
hours before he’d been missed. 

He went to the hospital with 
severe frostbite, but he died two 
days later of pneumonia compli- 
cated by streptococcal septicemia. 
“Stick around down there, Johnny,” 
the Chief said. “I’m coming down 
to join you.” 

1 HEARD him turning the moni- 
tor microphone over to one of 
the technicians out in the contami- 
nated labs. Oh hell, I thought. Here 
comes a chewing-out that would 
leave me raw up to the duodenum. 

The worst thing about being told 
off when you’ve done something 
dumb is the futility of being told 
about it. Nobody knew better than 
I that it was stupid to stay outside 
the Big Tank for eight solid hours. 
Hydraulic pressure aside, a chas- 
tity-suit isn’t designed to hold a 
man more than about four. 

It took Dr. McQueen a quarter 
hour to get suited up and scrubbed. 
Then he came down the ladder to 
join me in the pale green soup, his 
airhose snaking along behind him 
like strayed umbilical cord. He sat 
on the bench beside me. Before he 
cut in his suit radio, he leaned close 
and touched his helmet to mine. 



12 



GALAXY 



“Damn it, Johnny! If you don’t 
stop chasing after that dame in 
Valpo, I’ll toss mothballs in the 
gas-tank of your silly little car.” 
Then he toggled his radio. “Test- 
ing,” he said, for the benefit of the 
monitoring technician listening out 
in the contaminated labs. “This is 
McQueen. Someone suited up?” 

“Safety man is suited and scrub- 
bing, Chief,” the monitor said. “I 
read you loud and clear. Now, let’s 
hear from you, Brother Bogardus.” 

“This is John Bogardus, the 
Voice of Purity,” I said, “broad- 
casting from the bottom of Central 
University’s lovely BICUSPID 
pool. You want I should dedicate 
my next record to the gang at the 
brewery?” 

“Happy to hear you testify, 
canned-goods,” the technician said. 
“The I.U. game is on the radio now. 
You want me to pipe it to the 
phones so you can hear our team 
smear ’em?” 

“I’ll take your word for it that 
they’ll do that,” I said. “My sport 
is balk-line billiards.” Eighty years 
ago, Central University’s gate re- 
ceipts from football had made pos- 
sible the first BICUSPID program 
in gnotobiotics, using mice and 
roaches and hamsters. Despite this 
historical tie between me and foot- 
ball, I felt no special affinity for the 
game. 

“Trouble with you, canned- 
goods, is you’ve got no school 
spirit,” the monitor complained. 



“If you or the Chief feel your feet 
getting wet, just whistle. I’ll be 
here.” 

“Will do.” For all the thousands 
of times I’d been through this anti- 
septic drill, I was happy to know 
that a lifeguard was suited up 
above our poisonous bathtub, ready 
to fish either of us out should our 
suits spring a leak. If formalde- 
hyde-methanol started seeping in- 
to my chastity-suit, I knew I’d have 
an overwhelming desire to undress. 

Dr. McQueen cleared his throat, 
a sound which broadcast very like 
a growl. “Okay, Johnny. Let’s have 
a synopsis of your Sunday outing.” 

66TT’S springtime, Chief,” I said. 

“You know what the month 
of May does to a young man’s 
fancy, and reticuloendothelial sys- 
tem, and all.” 

“I wish you’d stop seeing her,” 
the Chief said. “You’ve got fifteen 
of the most nubile girls in the Mid- 
west living in the Big Tank with 
you. Sweet, intelligent — available. 
So why did you have to get the 
hots for an outsider?” 

“It’s that ol’ debbil incest-taboo, 
Chief,” I said. “I’ve slept amongst 
those fifteen canned peaches for the 
last twenty-three years. The result 
is that my warmest feeling toward 
any of them is brotherly love. Who 
itches to shack with a sibling?” 

“Your only alternative seems 
to be a lifetime of cold showers,” 
McQueen said. “Speaking of 



WORLD IN A BOTTLE

canned peaches, have you seen 
Mary deWitte today?” 

“No.” 

“Mary has extramural interests, 
too,” he said. “Her intended is a 
basketball player in pre-Law. A 
fellow roughly fifteen feet tall. 
Mary has been gone all day. I pre- 
sume that she’s been visiting this 
legal obelisk; and I’m beginning to 
feel the twinges of fatherly anxiety. 
But tell me about Anne, Johnny.” 

“I met her at a concert last fall,” 
I said, not giving a damn about the 
safety man and the monitor kibitz- 
ing. “Anne didn’t bug at my chas- 
tity-suit the way most of the hens 
on campus do. This impressed me. 
She liked the way I talked, even 
though she could hear my voice 
only from the speaker on the chest 
of my suit. I liked fine the way she 
listened. So we had a date. Lots of 
dates. Said goodnight by shaking 
hands — Please Excuse My Glove. 

“One evening we drove down to 
the beach at Hudson Lake. As we 
lay there on the sand, I pointed out 
for Anne the red disk of Mars. I 
told her about the men up there, 
at New Caanan and Bing City and 
Bitterwater, working to uncover 
one world while they built a new 
one. I told her about the mystery 
of the Immermann skull, and what 
it might mean. I pointed to the stars 
and named them for her. All the 
time, Chief, I kftew that I could 
touch Betelgeuse or Phobos as 
easily as I could touch Anne. 



“Anyway, we went swimming 
together, just like we were in Tech- 
nicolor and VistaVision. I screwed 
the cap on my air-filter and 
breathed from the reserve tank. 
Anne wore a bikini. I might as well 
have been aboard a midget sub- 
marine. After that evening, we de- 
cided not to go swimming any 
more; and Anne started wearing 
strict and conservative clothes.” 

“What happened today, 
Johnny?” McQueen asked me. 

“What could happen?” I de- 
manded. “We broke up. She’s con- 
taminated, poor girl. She’s been 
aswarm with bacteria and yeasts 
and molds and miscellaneous pro- 
tista ever since the obstetrician 
slapped her on the rump, while 
I’m Boy Galahad, fifty-six one- 
hundredths percent purer than 
Ivory Soap. My strength is as the 
strength of ten, so I told Anne at 
noon today that she’ll have to find 
herself a new boy friend. She needs 
a guy who can eat the other half 
of the pizza with her, someone who 
can lend her his comb and breathe 
the air she breathes. It took me 
weeks to steel my soul to the pros- 
pect of kissing Anne off — there’s 
an ironic metaphor for you, Chief 
- but I did it.” 

“I’m sorry, Johnny,” McQueen 
said. 

“I’m afraid I’ve diluted the anti- 
septic with my tears,” I said. “Just 
singing those old formaldehyde 
blues.”

I’d soaked for the regulation 
half-hour now, and the gage of my 
reserve tank was on red, so I got up 
to go. “I can see myself at ninety- 
five,” I said. “I’ll be patriarch of the 
Big Tank. The oldest male virgin 
on campus. See you inside, Chief.” 

I climbed up the ladder through 
the second manhole over the for- 
maldehyde sump and stepped out 
into the sterile precincts of the Big 
Tank. Home. 

T STEPPED into a shower-booth, 
A let the water blast the formal- 
dehyde off my chastity-suit, popped 
off my helmet and stripped. Air 
against sweat-steamed skin felt 
good. I showered again, naked. I 
blotted myself dry and dressed in 
fresh shorts, all the clothing a man 
needed in the air-conditioned 
Elysium of the Big Tank. I carried 
my suit into the locker room to 
refit it for my next trip outside. 
Snapping its collar to the bushing 
of the compressed-air supply and 
turning on the pressure, I inflated 
my suit so that it stood on its head- 
less shoulders, ready for inspection. 

The wet air-filter that had al- 
most asphyxiated me had been 
caused, I discovered, by a break in 
the moisture-trap of the unit. Care- 
ful checking assured me that the 
filter had failed-safe bacteriologi- 
cally. No outside bugs were in my 
suit. I might have suffocated, but 
my corpse would have remained 
uncorrupted. Such a comfort. 



I replaced the trap and filter 
with a fresh unit and fit a charged 
bottle of air onto the back of the 
suit. Then I gave every inch of 
my chastity-suit an inspection for 
worn spots, for bubbles forming on 
its moist surface — an inspection as 
painstaking and as sure as a win- 
dow washer’s check of his working 
harness, or an exhibition jumper’s 
folding of his parachute. Satisfied 
that the suit was all set for my next 
adventure into the world of normal, 
septic human beings, I racked it 
and the helmet in my locker and 
walked out into the garden. 

There I stretched out on the 
grass under the ultra-violets, re- 
freshing my tan while I waited for 
Dr. McQueen to come up from 
the sump. 

The garden was my favorite 
room in the Big Tank. It was in 
establishing the garden that I’d 
discovered that my Machiavellian 
mind is articulated to a pair of 
green thumbs. The crafty bit came 
over coffee in the cafeteria. I, of 
course, just sat there to listen and 
talk; not even C.U. Cafeteria coffee 
is aseptic enough for a Lapin to 
drink, even if there were some way 
to get a cup of the stuff inside the 
helmet of a sterility-suit. Anyway, 
I chided these two graduate stu- 
dents from the botany department 
about the research possibilities 
they were missing by not growing 
any gnotobiotic green stuff. I gave 
them the Boom-Food pitch. Would

cabbages, grown in an environment 
free of bacteria, grow large as king 
farouks? I hit them with the Ad- 
vance the Frontiers of the Biologi- 
cal Science line: could soil-nitrates 
be utilized by legumes in the abso- 
lute absence of Nitrobacteriaceae? 

TP HE two botanists leaped to my 
vegetable bait like a brace of 
starving aphids. A couple days 
after I’d commenced my con, three 
tons of quartz sand were shipped 
through the Big Tank’s main auto- 
clave. The lifeless stuff was poured 
over a grill of perforated pipes. The 
pipes were connected to a brew- 
tank of hydroponic juices, and the 
wet sand was planted with germ- 
free seeds of grass, tomatoes, car- 
rots, and other useful herbs. We 
Lapins had a ball, planting the 
aseptic seeds in the dirtless dirt 
eagerly as a band of ribbon-hungry 
4-H’ers. What had been our sun- 
room blossomed, after a decent 
period of germination, into our 
lawn and garden. 

For some reason, the garden of 
our Eden never got an apple-tree. 
But we did have lettuce on our 
sterile sandwiches now, and fresh 
tomatoes, infinitely superior in tex- 
ture and taste to the “radared” fruit 
— almost pureed by the high- 
energy beams that made it germ- 
free — that we’d grown up on. 

The lesser mammals with whom 
we twenty-nine Lapins shared the 
Big Tank, the rabbits and guinea- 



pigs and hamsters and like small 
fowl, didn’t go much for fresh vege- 
tables, having developed a palate 
for an autoclaved diet. The mon- 
keys, though, proved to be real 
competitors for carrots and raw 
sweet corn. They had to be locked 
out of the garden, rather as cer- 
tain of their disobedient relatives 
had been. 

I reached out from my supine, 
sun-drenched position to pull a 
turnip. I shook off the moist sand 
and wiped the hydroponic wetness 
off my shorts, to munch grittily 
while I waited for the Chief to join 
me. 

As soon as he’d soaked in the 
formaldehyde mixture for half an 
hour, Dr. McQueen came up 
through the manhole. Under the 
shower he squirted the chemical 
B.O. off his modified sterility-unit, 
then came out into the garden to 
join me, dragging his air-hose. We 
sat side by side on the park bench 
I’d built beside the onion-patch. (I 
was fond of my onions. They were 
the only living things in the Big 
Tank with the honest stink of life 
to them). “Where did you plant 
the marijuana, Johnny?” the Chief 
asked me. His voice was muffled 
by the wetness of his suit-speaker. 

“Now, there’s a pregnant idea,” I 
said. “We won’t plant muggles, 
Chief. We’ll plant tobacco. All we 
Lapins need to keep us happy is a 
good solid vice like smoking.” I 
looked at the Chief. “Why’d you 



16 



GALAXY 





follow me here, Dr. McQueen? I 
know I’ve been naughty.” 

“Self-pity doesn’t became a man, 
Johnny,” he said. 

“And why the hell not?” I de- 
manded, my blood-pressure ready 
to challenge any manometer in 
sight. “If I can feel compassion for 
some poor joker on TV, why can’t 
I hurt a little for myself — for John 
Bogardus, swaddled from his dar- 
ling by a damned plastic diving- 
suit? I was — I am — in love with 
Anne, Doctor.” 

“Your marriage-night would kill 
you, John,” he said. 

T JUMPED up with ready-made 
fists, then flopped down onto 
the grass, laughing at the picture 
I saw. Battle of the Century. In 
this corner, wearing helmet, chas- 
tity-suit, and thirty-five feet of air- 
hose, Roy McQueen, Ph. D. In the 
far corner, clad only in brown 
trunks (grass-stained on the seat, 
folks), John Bogardus, M.D. “It 
makes a grand old dirty joke, 
doesn’t it?” 

“It makes a painful reality,” Dr. 
McQueen said. “I know how you 
must lie awake nights, thinking 
about gradually acclimatizing 
yourself to the contaminated world 
in which Anne lives. You know, 
though, that the death-rate with the 
lower animals who’ve tried this ac- 
climatization is steep. Even the 
survivors don’t survive very long, 
because of their low gut-tone and 



their tardy antibody response. I 
suppose, though, that the immi- 
nence of death is as helpless before 
love as the locksmith.” Dr. Mc- 
Queen sighed. “If it’s what you 
want, Johnny, I’ll ignore every- 
thing we both know about the 
probable consequences and help 
you break out of here . Think 
how embarrassed you’d feel, 
though, if you died of a B. subtilis 
septicemia or a fulminant chicken- 
pox the day before the wedding.” 
“I could have married Anne, 
and made her either an unkissed 
bride or an early widow,” I said. 
“Neither of these alternatives 
struck me as an attractive career 
for the woman I love, so I left her. 
It’s so logical it’s practically simple 
arithmetic. Anne put up a fight to 
keep me, Chief; it was most warm- 
ing to my amour-propre. Women 
aren’t logical like us men of science. 
What a stinking situation!” 

“It is,” Dr. McQueen said. “But 
remember, John, lovers outside the 
Big Tank often get just as star- 
crossed as you and Anne.” 

“And they have dental caries to 
contend with, which we don’t,” I 
said. “Somehow, Chief, we’ll get 
this experiment into its second gen- 
eration, past the miseries of the 
gnotobiotic first-born, we Adams 
and Eves who were delivered into 
purity by aseptic Caesarian sec- 
tion. Maybe we’ll have to toss coins 
or draw cards to pair up for parent- 
hood. But any kids we raise will be 



18 



GALAXY 



spared that indignity. Know how 
I’ve got it figured, Chief? We’ve 
got to make provision for exoga- 
mous matings, right? Novelty, in 
other words, is essential to ro- 
mance. Here’s the way we’ll work 
it. We’ll set half the babies, boys 
and girls together, on one side of 
a wall, half on the other side. We’ll 
have established two tribes of kids, 
each growing up in ignorance of the 
other; and we’ll keep them strictly 
apart till they’re in their middle 
teens. Then, maybe the night of 
the Junior Prom, we’ll cut a door- 
way in that wall and introduce 
them to each other.” 

D R. McQueen smiled. “That 
will be a splendid evening, 
John. And a situation to make an 
anthropologist’s mouth water. You 
may have found the answer to one 
of your children’s major problems. 
I only wish we had as simple a 
solution to the current troubles of 
John Bogardus.” 

“Don’t blame yourself for what’s 
happened to me,” I said. “I’ve car- 
ried on pretty bad today, but that 
doesn’t mean that I or any of the 
other Lapins blame you for caus- 
ing us to be birthed into the Big 
Tank. It had to be done. Once Dr. 
Reyniers had made gnotobiotics 
possible, a colony of germ-free 
humans became available. Y ou did 
a good and honest job of bringing 
us colonists up, Chief. As good a 
job as anyone could do.” 



“Thank you, John,” he said. “I 
often wonder, though, whether the 
Nuremberg Principles really gave 
us the right to build and populate 
this germless microcosm. We told 
your mothers when they volun- 
teered that the results of raising 
humans gnotobiotically would be 
important. They have indeed. 
Thousands of lives have been 
saved by what we’ve learned here. 
We saw to it, as we’d also prom- 
ised your mothers, that your health 
hasn’t suffered by reason of experi- 
ments, that you’ve been given the 
education you need to earn a good 
living, and especially that your 
dignity as human beings has al- 
ways been respected. The core 
question is, did we have the right 
to involve fellow humans, not yet 
bom, in a process the end of which 
we couldn’t entirely predict? 
Enough of this, though. My con- 
science is my own problem. For 
your immediate relief I can offer 
only: keep busy.” 

“Work is dandy, but liquor’s 
quicker,” I said. “A wound of the 
heart calls for a therapeutic 
drunk.” 

“I’ll honor your prescription, 
Doctor,” the Chief said. “The mo- 
ment I get outside, I’ll Seitz you 
some of my own Scotch.” He stood 
up and caught hold of his air-hose. 
“Forgive me for behaving so like 
Pollyanna, John,” he said. “I wish 
I could offer you relief more potent 
than Scotch and sympathy.”

“Such spiritual Band-aids are all 
the help there is, Chief. Thank you 
for them.” 

He slapped me on the shoulder 
with his gloved right hand, then 
walked through the shower-room, 
trailing his black air-hose, and 
dropped down the manhole into 
the formaldehyde sump on his way 
back out into the world. 

I sat on my bench in my arti- 
ficial garden in the middle of the 
great steel womb I’d been deliv- 
ered into, and I thought about my 
Anne. 

66 TF I had a chisel and about 
four tons of Carrara marble,” 
the girl standing behind me said, 
“I’d hack me out a statue on your 
model, and call it The Thinker.” 
Dorothy — the Firebird — Damien 
plumped her little backside onto 
the bench beside me and scintil- 
lated eagerness to converse. 

I didn’t want to talk to anyone 
at the moment, certainly not to the 
Firebird. To employ a metaphor 
from an appetite less exalted than 
love, seeing the Firebird after los- 
ing Anne was too much like being 
offered hamburger after having had 
a filet mignon snatched from under 
nose. 

Still, as my peripheral vision 
took in the Firebird’s brilliantly 
distributed five-foot-three, I real- 
ized that my metaphor was false. 
That flame-colored hair and im- 
pish, freckled face; that halter taut 



as a double-barreled ballista 
cocked to fire twin rounds; I turned 
my attention to the girlscape be- 
side me, quite innocent of covet- 
ousness, my interest purely aes- 
thetic. No hamburger, this. Fire- 
bird Damien was filet mignon. 

But she wasn’t Anne. 

Suddenly I was contrite toward 
my fellow captive. “You’re looking 
splendid, Miss Damien,” I said. 

“And you got a face peeled off 
the iodine bottle. Tell mamma 
where it hurts.” 

“Don’t delve, doll.” 
“Woman-trouble?” she asked. 
“The term is tautological,” I said. 
“Woman and trouble are syno- 
nyms. If the language had any 
logic the words would rhyme.” 

The Firebird put a freckled arm 
across my shoulder and squeezed 
my deltoid with her resting hand. 
I shrugged. “Don’t try to shake me 
loose, Johnny,” she said. “I’m try- 
ing to find out what sort of people 
you are. Whether you’re a Shrinker 
or a Flesh-Presser.” 

“Obviously, you’re of the 
Shrinker persuasion,” I said. 

“Hoo-hah! Shrinkers are the 
other race from me,” the Firebird 
said. “They’re the people who 
quail at shaking hands, who never 
slap a back nor playfully pinch. 
They hate to be crowded, don’t 
like to be touched. My sort of 
people, though, tend to cuddle 
like puppies, or like cattle in a 
thunderstorm; we take comfort in 



20 



GALAXY 



the closeness of other humans. 
We’re not erotic about this, 
Johnny. Not necessarily erotic, I 
mean. We have our moments, too, 
or the Shrinkers would long since 
have taken over the world in spite 
of their dreadful handicap. We’re 
the people who make brilliant bar- 
bers. The kind who say hello to 
you with a Roman handshake and 
a clasp on the shoulder. We’re the 
doctors with the healing touch, the 
most tender nurses. We’re the 
Flesh-Pressers.” She gently 
squeezed my shoulder-muscle 
again to demonstrate. “Tell me 
whafs the matter, Johnny. Maybe 
I can help.” 

66TVTO magic touch will cure my 
trouble,” I said. “Anne and 
I are through. It was hopeless. I 
was like the goldfish in love with 
the cat. So I called our romance to 
a halt today and drove home in 
my little green sports-car, feeling 
a little green and hardly sporty at 
all. Please don’t mention this again, 
Firebird; not till I’m old and bald 
and my wound has healed to a thin 
white scar.” 

“Can I say one thing?” 

“You will, so do.” 

“I’m really sorry, Johnny.” 
“Thank you, Firebird,” I said. 
“The Chief promised to send some 
therapeutic juices through the 
Seitz filter. If you’ve a mind to 
sample a little sterile White Horse, 
perhaps tie one on with me this 



evening, you’d be most welcome.” 

“I’ll be proud and happy,” the 
Firebird said. She scooted even 
closer. 

I found her propinquity not at 
all unpleasant. Was I perhaps of 
the Flesh-Presser clan myself? 
The girT smelled good, the faint 
wholesome feminine odor of my 
Lapin foster-sisters — a perfume 
an outside wench, host to a uni- 
verse of bacteria, could approxi- 
mate only with Pepsodent and 
the most meticulous attention to 
her underarms, I gather from TV. 

“How am I to entertain you, 
sir?” the Firebird asked me. “I have 
current gossip, vintage scandal, 
clever anecdotes lifted from the 
steaming pages of my autoclaved 
Reader’s Digest, imitations of bird- 
songs — heavy on the mating- 
calls, these — and sheer adoration.” 
She paused. “Scratch that last of- 
fering, Johnny,” she said. “It’s un- 
hygienic for a girl to wear her heart 
on her sleeve, even here.” 

“I’ve lost touch with the Big 
Tank social whirl these last few 
weeks,” I said. “I’ve been spending 
all my alive-time in the greater 
world of Valparaiso, Indiana. Bring 
me abreast of the local gossip, Fire- 
bird, if you please.” 

“Gladly. First there’s the case 
of Mary deWitte. She’s still on the 
trail of her basketball star — a 
fellow named Lofting — confident 
that somehow they’ll manage to 
compromise her hateful purity . 



WORLD IN A BOTTLE 



21 



Maybe I shouldn’t have mentioned 
Mary,” she said, seeing that I was 
frowning. 

“I was just thinking,” I said. 
“Miss deWitte and I might get to- 
gether to establish an Amour 
Anonymous group in the Big 
Tank.” 

“If you do, Johnny,” the Firebird 
said softly, “write me up a card as 
a charter member.” 

“The Chief was talking about 
Mary deWitte only a few minutes 
ago,” I said. “Hasn’t she accepted 
the fact that we Lapins can’t hope 
to breed with those jungle weeds 
outdoors?” 

“Have you accepted that fact, 
Johnny?” the Firebird asked. 

“Apt question,” I admitted. 
“Sure. I’ve decided that Anne is as 
unavailable to me as Mars is. I 
don’t know which makes me more 
bitter, Firebird; losing Anne or be- 
ing denied the chance at the stars. 
Now that the solar system is get- 
ting man’s footprints all over it, 
now that the Orion ships are slam- 
ming out to Mars and back on a 
busline’s schedule, and the biggest 
ship of all is being fitted for deep 
space at the back of the moon, the 
constellations don’t seem much 
further off than Chicago. But not 
for me.” 

“You think you’re bitter, bud, 
you should hear me with my hair 
down,” the Firebird said. “But 
we’ve had dirges enough for one 
evening. Your whiskey should be 



filtered through by now. Let’s go 
wet our Scotch aperitif, and have 
dinner.” 

“I’m not hungry,” I said. “I just 
ate a turnip.” 

“Will turnips make you big and 
strong? You need solider food, like 
Scotch. That’s my professional 
opinion, Doctor.” She got up and 
.tugged at my hand. “Come on, 
Johnny. I’m not about to let you 
sit here all evening and brood.” 

“Is this your prescription, sweet 
Firebird?” I asked. “That I’m to go 
back to the madding crowd, mingle 
with my twenty-eight fellows in 
aseptic togetherness? Well, you’re 
probably right.” I got up from my 
park-bench to walk with her, 
hand-in-hand, to the dining room, 
stopping en route at my room for 
a shirt. Dinner was a formal affair 
in the Big Tank, shirts for the gen- 
tlemen and shoes for all. 

r | > HE other Lapins were already 
eating. They greeted me and 
especially the Firebird with jokes 
and fellowshippy sounds. 

I felt very much at home with 
them. There was Bud Dorsey, our 
weight-lifting astrophysicist, his 
magnificent u.v.-blackened body a 
study in the surface musculature 
of the human male. At his table was 
Karl Fyremeister, who has a prac- 
tically complete collection of the 
airmail stamps of the world to con- 
sole him on long winter evenings. 
All the stamps are quite sterile. 



22 



GALAXY 



Karl was talking with Gloria Moss, 
whose academic specialty was 
group dynamics. She demonstrated 
muscular dynamics so attractively 
that when she walked about the 
campus in her chastity-suit she 
drew whistles, a truly remarkable 
accolade when you consider that 
the c-suit is somewhat less faithful 
to the wearer’s form than a poncho. 
Keto Hannamuri sat the four-place 
table with Bud and Karl and 
Gloria. He was my fellow-medic 
among McQueen’s Beasts, a pedia- 
trician. Kids loved him. Wearing 
his sterility-suit as he made his 
Ped Ward rounds, that Oriental 
smile showing through the face- 
plate of his mask, Keto seemed to 
the television-nurtured youngsters 
the very model of the friendly 
extra-solar alien, complete with 
space-suit. Besides his flair for 
showmanship, Keto was a remark- 
ably fine doctor. As we passed his 
table, he slapped the Firebird’s 
short-shorted callipygia in a kin- 
ship-gesture of the Flesh-Presser 
clan. 

I felt a sudden overwhelming 
love for all these people, my 
brothers-and-sister-in-exile. I took 
my tray to sit down quick with 
the Firebird before my reserve, de- 
pleted by the emotional beating I’d 
taken at noon, gave way. 

The menu featured radared 
steak. The meat was germ-free 
and somewhat tenderized by the 
high-energy beams. (A purist in 



culinary proteins might go so far 
as to say denatured.) The nearest 
any Lapin came to ingesting a bac- 
terium was here at the table, where 
we ate billions of bacterial corpses. 
The bugs achieved a post-mortem 
revenge by triggering the produc- 
tion of faint bacterial antibodies in 
our blood. 

Besides the steaks and the myr- 
iads of murdered microbes, we 
had an aseptic salad prepared from 
Tank-grown hydroponic vegeta- 
tion, dressed with Roquefort, the 
cheese that vies with penicillin in 
my private hall of fame as the 
noblest product ever a mold gave 
man. The Scotch that Dr. Mc- 
Queen had promised to send was 
on hand, Seitz-filtered into a ster- 
ile White Horse bottle. Not really 
caring to dilute my poignancies 
with alcohol, I passed the whiskey 
among the tables nearby. 

' I 'HE Firebird was managing to 
A stay quite close to me, though 
technically remaining on her own 
side of the table, eating and talk- 
ing and now and then flashing me 
such a glance of yearning that I 
was pierced by the sight of her and 
by a remembered line of e. e. Cum- 
mings’s: . your slightest look 

easily will unclose me though I 
have closed myself as fingers . 
Just as suddenly, I realized that 
mine was a highly pathological 
state of mind, the rinse-phase of 
the brain-wash. Autism can be 



WORLD IN A BOTTLE

produced as surely by loneliness 
or unrequitable love as by injec- 
tions of LSD-25. 

So I turned my attention to my 
environment, consciously flexing 
my muscles of mental health. I 
answered the Firebird’s sallies 
with automatic flippancy. I ate my 
steak, savoring its flavor. And I 
looked about the dining-room, ex- 
amining it as though I’d never 
eaten there before. 

The Lapins’ dining-room in the 
Big Tank is about the size of a 
railroad restaurant car. (Not that 
I’ve ever been aboard a train to 
make the comparison. The strin- 
gencies of the sterility-suit tie such 
of us to the Big Tank on a short 
leash: the most sanitary of outside 
washrooms would prove a pesthole 
to a Lapin.) The kitchen, which 
was under the supervision of the 
Firebird, our dietitian, could have 
been squeezed into a telephone 
booth. It served chiefly as receiv- 
ing-station for the autoclave and 
the radar-room, through which all 
our food came. With its ten little 
four-place tables, each covered 
with a gypsy red-checkerboard 
cloth, set with a green glass vase of 
Tank-grown daisies, our dining- 
room was friendly enough. The 
Tank-ness of it, though, was em- 
phasized by a mural along one 
wall, a fantasy of stars and men 
and microbes that half a dozen of 
us had planned and painted one 
week. Where the mural was now 



had once been a picture window, 
overlooking a green stretch of 
Central campus, a source of com- 
fort to us all. An Air Force jet, 
though, pulling out of a dive invis- 
ibly above us, had sonic-boomed a 
crack in both panes of the double 
glass of the window, causing a gen- 
eral alert as we realized that some 
airborne Proteus or fortunate 
Staphylococcus or lonely Asper- 
gillis might have invaded our for- 
tress through this almost micro- 
scopic breach in our walls. 

Careful decontamination had 
saved our sterility, but now the 
Big Tank had no window. 

“I was saying . .” the Firebird 
said, in a firm voice. 

“Sorry, doll. You were saying?” 
“That Mary deWitte isn’t here. 
Do you suppose she’s still outside? 
She checked out her sterility-suit 
about the same time you did.” 
“That’s a good nine hours ago,” 
I said, glancing at the clock set 
over Saturn on our mural. “Either 
Mary has been on a restricted- 
fluids diet, or True Love has made 
her*careless of visceral discomfort.” 
“Don’t be coarse, Johnny.” 

“The demands of the kidney are 
as exigent as those of the heart, 
Firebird,” I said. “I think I’d better 
call Dr. McQueen.” 

“You’ll only cause trouble for 
her and Lofting,” Firebird said. 

“I’ve decided that it’s better to 
be lovesick than dead,” I explained, 
getting up from the table.

1 WENT to the phone in the cor- 
ner of the dining-room and 
dialed Dr. McQueen’s home. 
“Chief? John Bogardus. Mary de- 
Witte still hasn’t come home to 
roost. I think we’d better find her 
before she does something splen- 
did and foolish.” 

“Like perhaps marrying her con- 
taminated basketball-player and 
setting out on a suicidal honey- 
moon?” Dr. McQueen suggested. 
“You’re right, John; we should 
prevent that sort of thing. The rub 
is, we’re too late. I got a phone- 
call from Mary a few minutes af- 
ter I got home this evening. She 
abandoned her sterility-suit in a 
downtown Chicago hotel room at 
noon today, and married her fledg- 
ling lawyer in a civil ceremony at 
one o’clock. I tried to find out 
from her where she was, but she 
just said she was very happy and 
hung up.” 

“Hell! What are we going to 
do?” 

“I’m flying to Chicago, where 
I’ll ask the help of the police in 
finding Mary,” the Chief said. 
“Once I’ve run down the happy 
couple, though, damned if I know 
what I’ll do next. Shall I stand 
outside the bridal chamber with 
a syringeful of broad-spectrum an- 
tibiotics, waiting for Mary to 
sneeze?” 

“They’ll have a short marriage,” 
I said. 



“Mary knows how likely it is 
that she’ll never grow old,” Dr. 
McQueen said. “But I suspect that 
she hasn’t said a word to her hus- 
band. I’d better go now, John. 
My plane leaves in twenty min- 
utes.” 

“Don’t let this prey on you too 
much, Chief,” I said. “We Lapins 
have free will, too. We’re old 
enough to bear the responsibilities 
for our own actions.” 

“Thank you, Johnny.” Dr. Mc- 
Queen hung up. 

I returned to the table with no 
enthusiasm for the remaining half 
of my steak. “What’s up, John- 
ny?” the Firebird asked me. 

“Now we are twenty-eight,” I 
said. “They were married in Chi- 
cago at one o’clock.” 

“How wonderful!” the Firebird 
exulted. 

She stood and pounded our 
table-top with the vase, scatter- 
ing damp daisies on the cloth. 
“Quiet, everybody! I’ve got an an- 
nouncement.” The chatter over 
dessert simmered down. “Mary 
deWitte got married today — 
here’s to the bride!” Firebird 
slopped two ounces of White 
Horse into her glass and downed 
them at a heroic gulp. She sat, 
sputtering. The chatter at the 
other tables crescendoed as our 
colleagues reminded one another 
of the significance of the Firebird’s 
news.

“Will you also propose the toast 
at Mary’s wake?” I asked. 

66 X\T HAT a hideous thing to 
“ say!” 

“It was, Firebird,” I said. “For- 
give me, please. This thing has left 
me in a wounding mood.” 

“Is Mary really in such dan- 
ger?” Firebird asked. 

“She may last a week, not much 
more. Today she’ll meet Klebsiel- 
la, probably; perhaps E. coli and 
Shigella. Pretty soon she’ll start 
to sniffle with the first common 
cold she’s ever experienced. Polio 
virus and the ECHO group may 
get to her first, and establish 
themselves before there is suffi- 
cient growth of bacterial flora to 
give them competition. Her intes- 
tinal walls are thin and weak, so 
she may suffer megacolon as a 
result of gas-producing fermenta- 
tion. From a pathologist’s point 
of view, I’ll find it most instruc- 
tive to learn the manner of Mary 
Lofting’s death. From the stand- 
point of a friend and fellow Lapin, 
though, I’ll think her death a 
damned shame.” 

“I’m getting a little drunk, John- 
ny,” the Firebird said, “and a lit- 
tle maudlin. So, say you’re right. 
After all, you’re the doctor and 
I’m just a dumb dietitian. But 
don’t you think maybe it’s worth 
while, what Mary’s done? Con- 
demning herself to die, I mean, be- 
cause she’s really in love, and 



death is what she’s got to pay for 
a few days’ happiness. Don’t you 
think the price is fair, Johnny?” 

“If I did, I’d be paying it,” I 
said . “No, Firebird. Seizing a 
little love and poetry before the 
sacrifice is great stuff for epics, 
but it doesn’t make much sense 
to me. When I’m married I’ll want 
to see my children all the way 
through Spock and Gesell. I’ll 
want to grow old with my wife, if 
you’ll excuse the com.” 

“We Flesh-Pressers have a natu- 
ral reverence for corn,” the Fire- 
bird said. “It’s part of the syn- 
drome. Johnny, if you really want 
what you just said, want those 
things badly enough to set up a 
marriage on half a love, give me 
a call. Anytime. Even though I 
don’t set your blood aflame.” She 
stood up, a little unsteady, and 
rubbed her hand across her eyes 
in a tardy effort to hide tears. 
“Save the brushoff till tomorrow, 
Johnny,” she said. “Goodnight.” 
“Goodnight, sweet Firebird,” I 
said. She turned and walked 
quickly from the dining-room. 

Bud Dorsey, our weight-lifting 
astronomer, left his three com- 
panions to bring his coffee over 
and sit with me. Bud was the 
Lapin who’d have been a Central 
U. fullback as an undergraduate, 
if only Dr. McQueen had let him 
play the game in a chastity-suit. 
“What will happen to Mary de- 
Witte, John?” he asked. 



26 



GALAXY 



“She’ll die,” I said. 

“One flight in the sunlight, then 
her wings fall off. We Lapins are 
a fragile race. May I?” I nodded. 
Dorsey poured some of the Scotch 
into Firebird’s empty water-glass 
and sipped it. 

66 r T' HE men who devised the 
Nuremberg Principles failed 
us when they forgot to underwrite 
the romantic aspirations of human 
guinea-pigs,” I said. “As a result 
of their oversight, it seems that 
McQueen’s Beasts have made a 
bigger contribution to sociology 
than to bacteriology. We’ve 
demonstrated that familiarity 
doesn’t breed. Here we are, now, 
fourteen pairs of healthy Ameri- 
cans in their middle twenties, and 
neither a marriage nor a pregnan- 
cy amongst us. Why?” 

‘Tell me, John,” Dorsey said. 

“I’ll tell you why,” I said. “It’s 
because we’re fond of our foster- 
sisters, but we’re also a little 
bored with them. And they with 
us. We men know every canned 
peach’s flirtations and frailties and 
conversational gambits so thor- 
oughly that one of us could no 
more marry one of them than the 
average outsider could marry his 
kid sister.” 

“Even that’s been done, John, 
just for principle’s sake,” Dorsey 
said. “The Pharaohs wed their sis- 
ters because no one else was 

WORLD IN A BOTTLE 



exalted enough for the honor. Our 
predicament is not dissimilar. The 
primal urge, John, will in time 
overwhelm the curse of contigu- 
ity.” 

“Could be,” I said. “But it’s not 
just sex that’s agonizing me, Bud. 
Prison has whole constellations of 
frustration. However warm and 
understanding our guards may be, 
this is still a prison, and half of 
us are stir-crazy. Why did Mike 
Bohrman take off his chastity-suit 
last winter, to walk barefoot 
through the snow with only his 
suit-shorts on, till he collapsed 
from the cold? It was a prison- 
break, Bud. So was Mary de- 
Witte’s witless marriage. They 
were both suicide, the lifer’s one 
way over the wall.” 

“Stir-crazy?” Dorsey asked. 
“You’re exaggerating, John.” 

“Open your eyes, Bud,” I said. 
“Look at Karl Fyrmeister’s hands, 
for example. I’m violating no 
medical confidence to tell you that 
Karl got his dermatitis as the re- 
sult of compulsive hand-washing. 
There’s a fine neurotic symptom 
for a germ-free Lapin! If I’m exag- 
gerating our collective un-sanity, 
Bud, tell me why Lucy Cashdol- 
lar has become an apprentice al- 
coholic. Why does Fizz Ewell, 
with an I.Q. that must range in 
the 150’s and the most brhliant 
record the Nuclear Engineering 
Department has ever seen, spend 

27 



six hours a day working cross- 
word puzzles? Why do you have 
that tic of your left orbicularis 
oculi? Why am I an insomniac, 
with a nasty barbiturate habit? 
Look around, Bud. You’ll see that 
our little home has turned into 
something of a snakepit. Our neu- 
roses are only garter snakes so 
far; but they’ll grow into cobras, 
given time and further frustration 
to feed on.” 

T\ORSEY’S left eye twitched as 
though my mentioning his 
tic had triggered it. He self-con- 
sciously raised his fingers to the 
vellicating muscle, more to hide 
than to soothe it. 

“While our keepers were send- 
ing Lapins through every major 
discipline offered on the campus,” 
he said, “it seems they’d have done 
well to have trained one of us in 
psychiatry.” 

“For what?” I demaftded. “So 
we could have someone right here 
in the Tank to spoon out our 
soothing-syrups? Man, we’ve got 
a right to be stir-crazy. We’re life 
prisoners and we’ve committed 
no crime.” I stopped to get my 
calm back. “Bud,” I asked, “do you 
know what I want more than 
anything else, next to Anne?” 

“Of course I do,” Dorsey said. 
“Like you’ve pointed out, John, 
we’ve got no secrets from each 
other. Your big itch is to step 
aboard one of fhe Orion ships. You 



want to join up for the chase after 
interplanetary white whales.” 

“It’s only natural,” I said. “When 
we were kids, Bud, we saw the 
same TV programs, the same 
space-adventure movies, as the 
kids who are now the men in space. 
Every boy in America was condi- 
tioned to long for a space-suit. I’m 
one of the ones who could have 
made it, Bud. I love medicine, and 
I think I’m going to be a damned 
fine pathologist; but I’d turn in my 
M.D. for an Ordinary Spaceman’s 
ticket without a second’s hesitation. 
When I read, two years ago, that 
Immermann had discovered that 
human skull in the oxide rubble 
below Roosevelt Ridge in Syrtis 
Major, I cried for the first time 
since I was six years old. Twenty 
thousand years ago there was man 
on Mars. And I’m confined to 
Earth for life.” 

“How much do you know about 
the Immermann skull, John?” Dor- 
sey asked me. 

“What I’ve said. Is there more?” 

“One point,” Dorsey said. “My 
field, radio astronomy, is a deep- 
space sort of specialty; but I do 
from time to time condescend to 
read the Journal of Aerology and 
the other parochial, solar-system 
publications. Somewhere I read 
that there’s something odd about 
that skull Colonel Immermann 
dug up.” 

“If you’re suggesting that it was 
a second Piltdown hoax, planted in 



28 



GALAXY 



that Martian talus to jar larger Air 
Force appropriations from Con- 
gress, keep it from me,” I said. “I 
cherish the illusion that the Immer- 
mann is genuine, and a mystery.” 

uT T isn’t phony, and it’s sure 

A as hell a mystery,” Dorsey 
said. “Colonel Immermann’s initial 
report of the skull’s discovery was 
verified by every member of the 
Orion Gamma’s crew, a gang 
recuited mostly from Service- 
Academy grads and other high 
moral types. The peculiarity I’m 
talking about isn’t forensic. It’s 
functional. If you were to mix in 
the Immermann skull with an as- 
sortment of skulls of modern west- 
ern men, age forty or thereabouts, 
only one characteristic would allow 
you to pick it out from the mixture 
again. ‘Look, Mom— No Cavities!’ 
Like us Lapins, Immermann Man 
had acarious teeth.” 

“Because he was germ-free?” I 
suggested. 

“It’s possible. Or his medical 
science may have gotten oral bac- 
teria under control with drugs. 
Maybe he preserved his teeth by 
diet, or with fluorides in his drink- 
ing-water. Perhaps his mother 
never let him eat candy when he 
was a kid,” Dorsey said. “Who 
knows? Good teeth and all, though, 
our Immermann Man died twenty 
thousand years ago. Why? Was he 
germ-free, as you suggest; and was 
he killed by some species of Mar- 



tian micro-organism that’s since 
gone extinct from drought and a 
shortage of hosts? The big ques- 
tion, to my mind, is why none of 
our explorers has yet found any 
sign of the rest of the expedition.” 

“Expedition?” I asked. 

“A man could hardly have been 
alone on Mars,” Dorsey said. 

“From where?” 

“Pick any ‘F’- or ‘G’-type star 
with planets,” Dorsey said. “After 
all, it’s easier to posit extrasolar 
man than to suppose a flint-drive 
spaceship was devised by some 
early neolithic von Brauns.” 

“I’d never expected to see an 
astrophysicist take off on such a 
flight of improbabilia,” I said. 

“John, would you like to hear a 
thread-recording I just got from 
the radio observatory at Ade- 
laide?” Dorsey asked. 

“Hi-fi?” 

“The radio sky is strictly spark- 
gap quality, no fi at all,” Dorsey 
said, getting up to lead the way 
from the dining-room. “This trans- 
mission you’re going to hear 
doesn’t have anything to do with 
the ordinary 2 1.1 2 -centimeter 
neutral-hydrogen radiation; but of 
course you realize that our big 
paraboloid bowls can catch any- 
thing from hydrogen hiss to low- 
flying bats. Remember the Christ- 
mas celebration at New Caanan 
that was telecast to earth a couple 
years back? That show was caught 
by the six-hundred-foot receiver

at Green Bank, West Virginia, and 
rebroadcast by C.B.S.”

^XT e entered the Big Tank’s 
common room, where a few 
of our colleagues sat reading or 
writing notes for tomorrow’s classes 



— talking; playing chess or bridge; 
or sitting behind the closed glass 
doors of the TV alcove watching 
the picture through stereo spec- 
tacles. We entered the alcove at 
the other end of the room, where 
the record-player and music library 
were, and closed the door. 

Dorsey took a three-inch spool 



30 



GALAXY 




of magnetic thread from his shirt 
pocket and fit it to the playback 
head of the machine. 

“I’m interested in your unin- 
structed reaction, John,” he said. 
“So don’t ask me any questions 
till you’ve heard the whole se- 
quence.” 

“Spin it, professor,” I said. 



The Australian thread had a 
noisy background, sounding like a 
dozen rashers of bacon tossed into 
a too-hot skillet. Over this hissing, 
the code began to sound. “DIT — 
DIT . DIT-DIT . DIT-DIT- 
DIT-DIT . DIT-DIT-DIT . 
DIT - DIT - DIT - DIT - DIT - 
DIT - DIT - DIT - DIT . DIT - 



WORLD IN A BOTTLE 



31 



DIT-DIT-DIT ...” I dutifully en- 
tered my count of each burst of 
DIT’s in my pocket notebook. The 
sequence went: 1, 1; 2, 4; 3, 9; 4, 
16; 5, 25; 6, 36; then 5, 2, 49; 8, 64. 
There the count stopped climbing 
and commenced again with the 
pair of ones, to repeat the whole 
set again. 

Dorsey cut off the machine. 
“I’ve got four hours of the same 
thing on this thread,” he said. 
“Want to hear it all, or have you 
got it already?” 

“It’s obvious, up to a point,” I 
asked. “It’s a table of the first eight 
natural integers and their squares, 
except for the number seven, 
which for some reason is split in 
two.” 

“It took me quite a while to rec- 
ognize what happened to that 
seven,” Dorsey said. “Listen to it 
again.” He spooled the thread back 
and I listened again to the frac- 
tured seven: “DIT - DIT - DIT - 
DIT - DIT . DIT - DIT.” Then 
again the forty-nine clicks, seven- 
squared. Dorsey switched off the 
player. 

“Let’s have the distillate of your 
cerebrations now, Brothers Bogar- 
dus,” he said, dropping into the 
deep, red-leather easy chair be- 
side the thread-player. 

“It’s syncopation, Brother Dor- 
sey,’* I said. 

“I’d never have given my own 
modest observations so high-flown 
a title,” Dorsey said. “I’d simply 



have called it, country boy at heart 
that I am, ‘Shave-and-a-Haircut, 
two-bits!’ ” 

“So it is,” I said. “Now we’ve 
deciphered that broadcast, and 
listened to the singing commercial. 
But I’m still puzzled, Bud. We 
don’t have the sponsor’s name and 
address; and I’m not at all sure I 
caught the name of his product. 
What’s he advertising?” 

“His presence,” Dorsey said. “I 
interpret the message as a simple 
CQ.” 

“Seek you?” I asked. 

“Xes. Radio-ham code for, ‘I’m 
lonely — will somebody please talk 
tome?”’ 

<^T’LL accept that interpretation 
only till I can think of one 
even more fantastic,” I said. 

“O.K., John,” Dorsey said. “Get- 
ting the address of the station was 
a simple exercise, thanks to my 
Digger confreres in Adelaide and 
the men at Harvard’s South Afri- 
can radio observatory. We first 
heard the message two years ago. 
It’s' still being broadcast, un- 
changed. The fist on the key that 
sent out our arithmetic message 
belongs to someone in the neigh- 
borhood of Alpha Centauri.” 

“Hot damn!” I said. “But why 
didn’t I know about this? I read 
Time, and all. Why wasn’t this 
headlined?” 

“Because it’s guesswork,” Dor- 
sey explained. “This may be the 



32 



GALAXY 



result of some cosmic coincidence 
as unrelated to intelligent planning 
as Bode’s Law.” 

“You’ll have to explain that to 
this groundsman,” I said. 

“Bode’s law, too, looks like an 
intelligently devised code of some 
sort,” Dorsey said. “Take the se- 
ries: 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192. 
Add 4 to each number, and divide 
by ten. The result will be, when 
you take the asteroid belt into 
consideration and fudge a little, 
very nearly the proportional dis- 
tance from the sun of the first seven 
planets. Accident, or evidence of 
intelligent planning? Turned out 
there are excellent physical rea- 
sons for this relationship, reasons 
old Johann Elert Bode couldn’t 
possibly have guessed. Things like 
this make astronomers leary of 
teleology. Make them avoid the 
splendid guess.” 

“Go ahead, make a splendid 
guess,” I said. “I won’t report you 
to the Astronomers Union.” 

“Sure,” Dorsey said. “Alpha 
Centauri, as the U. Cal’s five-meter 
Luna ’scope demonstrated several 
years ago, has a system of at least 
three planets. We don’t know much 
about those planets except their 
time of revolution.” 

“And that one of them has a citi- 
zen clever enough to calculate na- 
tural squares and build a radio 
transmitter . .” 

“. one hell of a transmitter!” 
Dorsey said. 



“. and whistle, ‘Shave and a 
Haircut, Two Bits,’” I went on; 
“which musical interlude argues 
for a certain degree of conviviality 
on the part of our Centaurian. This 
thing of his message, though. Do 
you think he was just looking for 
other hams to talk with?” 

1 1 HEN he’s awfully patient, 
sending out the same ‘CQ’ 
for two solid years,” Dorsey said. 
“It’s hardly practical to communi- 
cate between stars, John. Broad- 
casting from here to Alpha C. and 
back, it would take more than nine 
years just to ask how’s the wife 
and kids. 

“The way it looks to me, our 
friend out there got the duty of 
cutting an educational recording 
to be broadcast automatically to 
the rest of the galaxy. Kind of a 
lighthouse, to help his race get in 
touch with any relatives it might 
have. That same recording has 
been played over and over again 
ever since, sending To Whom It 
Might Concern its dual message. 
Simple math — and the most per- 
sistent rhythmical cliche known to 
man.” 

“What’s being done about it?” I 
asked. 

“We’ve answered,” Dorsey said. 
“A big radio noise on the moon is 
broadcasting the same message, 
minus the syncopation, and adding 
the next two terms; all this beamed 
toward Alpha Centauri. And two

years ago, the Defense Depart- 
ment cut other programs to the 
bone to start construction of Orion 
Zeta, the sixth of the big nuclear- 
pulse ships. She’s up in von Weiz- 
sacker Crater on the back of the 
moon now, John, nearly finished. 
She’s not meant to call at solar- 
system ports.” 

“The government thinks, and 
you think, that our operator four 
and a half light-years from here 
was human,” I said. 

“I can’t speak for the govern- 
ment. But that’s what I think. Isn’t 
it human to toss notes out to sea 
in bottles? What’s more human 
than dropping a joke into an arith- 
metical table?” 

“All we’ve got to do to prove 
your splendid guess is to highjack 
a germ-free spaceship,” I said. 
“You and me and any of the other 
Lapins who feel as we do. We’ll go 
shake the hand — or other prehen- 
sile member, if he’s not human 
after all — of our Centaurian 
thread-jockey. What’s to keep our 
feet in the mud, when our heads 
are ’way the hell out in a southern 
constellation?” 

“I gather, Herr Doktor, that 
you jest,” Dorsey said. “If you were 
serious, I’d point out one minor 
flaw in your blueprint for adven- 
ture. It would take our little band 
of pirates one hundred twenty-five 
years to get to Alpha Centauri, 
after we’d stolen the ship. That’s 
with the gas-pedal to the floor.” 



“I was joking,” I said. “I was 
pretending to be the hero of one of 
those TV space-operas we used to 
watch . But if I were serious, I 
don’t think a mere century and a 
quarter would faze me. We 
couldn’t reach our goal in person, 
Bud; but we could send our chil- 
dren’s children. All we’d need to 
make the trip, if I were serious 
about my suggestion, would be a 
few more volunteers. A proper pro- 
portion of those volunteers had 
best be philoprogenitive females.” 

U r) O you think the BICUSPID 
brass will be happy to see 
its expensive guinea-pigs taking 
off into space?” Dorsey asked. 
“Since ’29, John, there’s been 
eighty million bucks poured into 
gnotobiotics here at Central Uni- 
versity. We’re the payoff. We can 
hardly expect Dr. McQueen to 
stand on the launching-pad, tossing 
roses and shouting Bon Voyage as 
we blast off forever.” 

“I think they could be per- 
suaded to be, if not enthusiastic, at 
least resigned to our departure,” I 
said. 

“It does prisoners good to plot 
escape-plans, even when they’re as 
obviously fantastic as this one,” 
Dorsey said. “Go on, John.” 

“As you say, our purpose in this 
adventure would be to escape,” I 
said. “There’s no place on earth 
that can take us, so we’re forced 
to escape into space. We’ll have

to talk this up around the Big Tank 
to see how many want to break out 
with us. What the sex-distribution 
of the volunteers is, whether we’ve 
got the right range of specialists 
to man a spaceship. Right, Bud?” 

“It’s your dream,” Dorsey said. 

“O.K. Immermann Man appears 
to have been germ-free,” I said. 
“Perhaps his culture had been gno- 
tobiotic for so long that they’d 
forgotten the existence of micro- 
organisms. Landing on other 
planets, they’d not rediscover the 
danger of infectious disease till it 
was too late. Suddenly they’d start 
falling, dying of illnesses as mys- 
terious to them as the plague was 
to men of the Renaissance. This 
may have been the manner in 
which the original owner of the 
Immermann skull died, on Mars. 
We have a reasonable suspicion 
that there was germ-free human 
life in our corner of the galaxy 
twenty thousand years ago. Per- 
haps, as you suggested, these visi- 
tors were members of an explora- 
tion party. From Alpha Centauri? 
Is our ham who hammered out the 
table-of-squares a member of that 
gnotobiotic race? Is he our brother 
in purity?” 

“Go on, Johnny,” Dorsey said. 
“You ain’t even winded, yet.” 

“The Orion Zeta is being built 
for deep space,” I went on. “Some 
group from earth is certain to set 
out in her on the four-generation 
hop to Alpha Centauri. Would it 



be morally right to allow this 
group of ambassadors to be made 
up of ‘normal,’ contaminated hu- 
mans? To carry to a possibly de- 
fenseless population a mixed bag 
of goodies like Micrococcus ureae, 
Bacillus vulgaris, Staphylococcus 
aureus, Mycobacterium tubercu- 
losis — a whole spectrum of benign 
and malignant bacteria? Remem- 
ber, Bud, bugs that are benign or 
only mildly pernicious on earth 
might prove to be killers away 
from home.” 

“Lots of maybes,” Dorsey said. 
“Lots of perhapses.” 

64 T ’VE got one more shaft in the 
quiver,” I said. “This one’s 
got a poisoned point, and it carries 
the names of our keepers. It’s dirty, 
Bud. It’s hardly fair to Dr. Mc- 
Queen to use such blackmail.” 

“Blackmail sounds like just 
what we need,” Dorsey said. 

“O.K. Thirty of us were bom 
into the Big Tank,” I said. “One 
has already died as a result of his 
mental state, caused by imprison- 
ment. Another is certain to die 
within the next few days. Had they 
been entirely sane, Mike Bohrman 
and Mary deWitte wouldn’t have 
shed their sterility-suits outside 
the Tank. Without purpose to their 
lives, they cracked up.

twenty-six years of the human 
studies at BICUSPID,” I went on. 
“Two, out of an original thirty. An

attrition-rate of six and seven- 
tenths percent. How many more 
Lapins will wander out to commit 
innocent suicide in the snow, their 
minds messed up by the frustra- 
tion and hopelessness of the 
guinea-pig way of life? How many 
more of us will escape from the Big 
Tank into the morgue? The Orion 
Zeta could be our salvation, Bud. 
It could give us the sort of purpose 
human beings must have in order 
to live.” 

Dorsey shook his head. “The 
Defense Department set up its 
young Clydeside in von Weizsaqker 
Crater just to build, test, and 
launch one ship: the Zeta. Two 
years of round-the-chronometer 
work have been poured into her,” 
he said. “She’s cost four billion 
dollars so far, Johnny; and they 
haven’t bought the living-room fur- 
niture yet. I hardly think the gen- 
erals will volunteer the result of 
all this effort to serve as psycho- 
therapy for twenty-eight neurotic 
Hoosiers.” 

“You miss the point, Bud,” I 
said. “We Lapins were born to 
crew the Zeta. Where else could 
you find a crew that’s already spent 
twenty-odd years or so inside a box, 
living together in close quarters, 
being conditioned against claustro- 
phobia? This Big Tank of ours 
could be a grounded spaceship, 
Bud! It’s airtight, armored against 
outside dangers, even has the for- 
maldehyde sump to serve us for 



airlock. What’s a sterility-suit, any. 
way, but a special breed of space 
suit? Could you find a better cre^ 
than us twenty-eight, skilled in two 
dozen professions, young, sound o| 
wind and limb, and willing as hell 
to take on the job? None of whom 
will ever have appendicitis, halij 
tosis, toothache, barber’s itch, or 
athlete’s foot? Any one of whom 
can, in case of accident, first-ai( 
his wounds with a spit-damp hand 
kerchief, and heal wholesome! 
Man, we’re what those generals 
have been dreaming of! Once we’ve 
been trained to aim that big ship 
and kick her off the back of the 
moon, we’ll be the finest extra-solar 
crew that ever blasted free of the 
system!” 

“One question,” Dorsey said 
“Where do I sign Ship’s Articles?” 

T\ R. McQueen was in Chicago 
for three days before he found 
Mary Lofting, nee deWitte. She 
had wakened that morning suffer- 
ing from a headache, a stiff neck, 
and four degrees of fever. Her hus- 
band had called an ambulance to 
take her to Michael Reese Hospi- 
tal. There, just before she’d lost 
consciousness, Mary had asked a 
nurse to call BICUSPID. The C.U. 
authorities had in turn called Dr. 
McQueen in Chicago. 

She came home on a stretcher, a 
bottle of fructose solution dripping 
into her veins. Mary had already 
been loaded with a double-barrel- 



ed shotgun-blast of every antibiotic 
she could safely take. Dr. McQueen 
rode back to the University in the 
ambulance with her, and with her 
husband. Lofting, holding the girl’s 
hand, explained time after time 
that she’d never told him about 
the likely consequence of her re- 
moving her chastity-suit in an un- 
chaste world. The basketball 
player said he’d never forgive him- 
self if she didn’t recover. 

Mary was taken to the C.U. 
hospital. Wearing a sterility-suit, I 
attended her examination, which 
was conducted by my chief-of- 
service, the staff pathologist, as 
well as the hospital’s internist and 
neurologist. I took a few cc’s of 
Mary’s cerebrospinal fluid back 
with me to the BICUSPID contam- 
inated labs. There, to anticipate a 
few days’ deliberate bacterial 
growth in media, her meningoen- 
cephalitis was discovered to have 
been caused by Erysipelothrix 
monocytogenes, an organism whose 
more usual victims are rabbits. 
Mary’s husband could explain her 
coming in contact with so exotic a 
pathogen only by the fact that 
they’d visited the Brookfield Zoo 
on the second, and last, day of their 
honeymoon. 

By the time these technical de- 
tails were known they were 
academic. The epidemiological 
problem had become secondary to 
the pathological. Mary Lofting 
had died. 



I was asked to assist Dr. Mc- 
Queen and the senior pathologist 
at autopsy — I was, after all, a 
resident in pathology, and had 
besides a special interest in this 
case — but I found the job more 
than I could take. Mary had been 
a sister to me for twenty-three 
years. In tears, I left the morgue 
during the classic cruciform inci- 
sion. 

T FOUND the Firebird in the li- 
-*• brary. I recognized her through 
the anonymity of her chastity-suit 
by the characteristic pose of her 
head and arms as she sat reading: 
elbow braced on the table-top, her 
right fist blocked stubbornly 
against the plastic cheek of her 
helmet, her left arm curved around 
the book as though to be a break- 
water against distraction. I sat 
beside her, and said, “Dorothy.” 

Without a word she closed her 
book, stood, and replaced it on the 
shelf. We walked hand in hand out 
into the autumn campus. 

“Last year,” I said, “it was 
Mike Bohrman, walking through 
snow-drifts in his suit-shorts, want- 
ing for once in his life to feel the 
real world against his skin. So he 
died. Five days ago, Mary deWitte 
married the man she loved. So she 
died,” I said. 

“Our life isn’t generally as hope- 
less as that,” the Firebird said. 

“No,” I said. “We’re fed and en- 
tertained. We’re being educated at 



36 



GALAXi 



WORLD IN A BOTTLE 



37 



one of the finest universities in the 
world — for us, she’s been a genu- 
ine, homogenized-milk Alma 
Momma. She even gives us an al- 
lowance to buy airmail stamps for 
our collection, or bar-bells, or gas 
for our sports-car. She’s given us 
everything we need for happiness. 
Everything, Firebird, but purpose. 
That’s why we’re all going nuts — 
why Mike went barefoot in the 
snow and Mary used love for a 
suicide-weapon. That’s why we’ve 
got to break free.” 

“Free?” she asked. “You mean, 
free to step outside the Big Tank, 
shed our sterility-suits, turn septic 
- and die?” 

“I mean free to step off earth.” 

We sat by mutual consent on a 
bench beneath a sugar maple, 
brushing aside half an inch of mul- 
ticolored leaves. I told the Firebird 
of the broadcast from a southern 
star, and about the Immermann 
skull. I told her all I knew about 
the Orion rockets, the nuclear- 
pulse ships that had gone through 
five prototypes to reach the Zeta. 
“She’s built to travel light-years,” 
I said. “I’m going with her when 
she leaves.” 

“Of course, I’m going with you,” 
she said. “Your spacemen will need 
a dietitian to make metabolic sense 
out of algal soups and hydroponic 
salads for the first couple of gen- 
erations, and to teach the young- 
sters to take over the kitchen once 
they’re on their own.” 



“Firebird,” I said, “I’m happy to 
welcome you aboard. Now we’ve 
got to get that ship.” 

“We’ll get it,” she said. “Under- 
stand, Johnny, it’s not the profes- 
sional challenge that makes me 
want to blast off for Alpha Cen- 
tauri with four generations to feed, 
I’ve got no special urge to tame 
frontiers. The reason I’m going - 
forgive me for mentioning it again, 
and cold sober — is to stay near, 
you.” 

I stood up, drawing her up after 
me, and was struck again by the 
aptness of the nickname, “chastity- 
suit.” 

“Perhaps I’ve overestimated the 
effectiveness of a certain taboo,” I 
said. “Come on, sweet Firebird. 
Let’s get back to the Tank to help 
Bud recruit the rest of our crew.” 

Z" 1 OLONEL Barrett was young 
^ for eagles. My fellow volun- 
teers-designate and I, all twenty- 
eight of us, were gathered in the 
lounge of English Hall, creaking 
and wheezing in our sterility-suits, 
looking very ready for hard space. 

The colonel wore crisp blues. 
His tunic was decorated by a triple 
row of medals-for-merit. It was not 
his fault that he wore no battle- 
stars. Barrett had graduated from 
the Air Academy into our seem- 
ingly endless Pax Desperandum. 
He’d never had a chance to see a 
roentgen radiated in anger. The 
Marsman Badge at the center of 



38 



GALAXY 



his left breast pocket was one 
rarely seen: the circle-with-arrow 
symbol of Mars had within it a 
“III,” signifying that its wearer had 
been a member of the Third Mars 
Expedition, back in the days when 
a flight to Mars had been some- 
thing more than a teamster’s run. 
The Marsman Badge was balanced 
by the star-topped, laurel-wreathed 
— and anachronistic — silver wings 
of a Command Pilot. 

As I shook hands with Colonel 
Barrett I found it difficult to con- 
ceal the envy that writhed in me. 
He’d seen the continents spread 
cloud-flecked on the receding, curv- 
ing earth, the stars shining beside 
the sun against the black sky. He’d 
splashed across the dust-carpet of 
the moon, tasted water melted 
from the polar cap of Mars. As a 
member of Expedition Three, he’d 
been with the crew of the Orion 
Gamma when Immermann dis- 
covered the twenty-thousand-year- 
old skull at the base of Roosevelt 
Ridge. 

Colonel Barrett addressed his 
remarks to me. “Central Univer- 
sity,” he said, “will lose the results 
of an eighty-million-dollar invest- 
ment if you people leave. They’ll 
be getting off cheap, compared to 
us. The Defense Department has 
been requested to turn over to you 
twenty-eight untrained grounds- 
men the greatest spaceship yet 
built, the first of the interstellar 
ships. The Zeta cost the taxpayers 



four dollars a pound to build. She 
weighs five hundred thousand tons, 
Dr. Bogardus.” 

“You’re mistaken, Colonel, 
when you say that the University’s 
investments in gnotobiotic research 
over the past eighty years will be 
lost if we Lapins end our part of 
the experiment. That’s not true. 
That investment has been repaid 
many times over. More has been 
learned of human physiology, nu- 
trition, and disease processes in the 
twenty-six years’ study of germ- 
free humans than was learned con- 
cerning these subjects during any 
similar period in medical history. 

“And, Colonel,” I went on, 
“we’re not untrained. Bud Dorsey, 
to your right, is an astrophysicist 
who worked with the Agassiz Ob- 
servatory team in mapping the 
interstellar anti-matter dust clouds. 
Dr. Keto Hannamuri is a pedia- 
trician. Dorothy Damien, our Fire- 
bird, is a dietitian. Fizz Ewell is a 
nuclear engineer. Karl Fyrmeis- 
ter’s degree is in chem engineering, 
as is Janie Bohrman’s. Gloria Moss 
is working on her doctorate in 
sociology. Her thesis, Colonel, 
deals with the social dynamics of 
small human groups such as ours. 
Alfred MacCoy, standing behind 
you, has written three symphonies 
and an oratorio so far; and R.C.A. 
Victor has threaded them all with 
the New York Philharmonic. Lucy 
Cashdollar has had her works of 
sculpture displayed in the National 



WORLD IN A BOTTLE 



39 



Gallery and at London’s Tate. 
There are some few resources 
here, Colonel.” 

“I didn’t intend to belittle your 
intellectual accomplishments, Dr. 
Bogardus,” the Colonel said. “I’ve 
read your dossiers. They’re impres- 
sive. When I called you untrained, 
what I really meant was that 
you’re totally unskilled in terms 
of my own specialty. I meant that 
none of you knows anything of the 
skills of simple chemical rocketry, 
much less the techniques required 
to lift half a million tons on a 
nuclear-pulse thrust.” 

“We can learn,” I said. 

“I hope so,” Colonel Barrett 
said, “because I’ve been ordered 
to teach you.” 

it W E’RE in?” Bud Dorsey de- 
” manded. 

“You’re in,” Colonel Barrett 
said. “The decision in the Penta- 
gon went against my recommen- 
dation that professionals in rock- 
etry be recruited for the Alpha 
Centauri flight. The generals 
liked your argument, Dr. Bogar- 
dus, that we should send a germ- 
free ship and a germ-free crew to a 
possibly germ-free planet. In a 
sense, this is tradition. Back in the 
’50s, moon-missiles were sponged 
down with Lysol before launch- 
ing, just in case they got where 
they were aimed at. Our people 
didn’t want to contaminate the 
moon’s surface with earthly micro- 



organisms, cluttering up the pic- 
ture for the bacteriologists who 
were scheduled to arrive later. The 
Chief of Staff said that if there is 
a germ-free population on one of 
the Centaurus planets, we must 
not initiate our contact with them 
by handing out the sort of prizes 
Cook’s crew brought to the South 
Seas — measles, tuberculosis, 
smallpox. We can’t know that even 
innocuous bacteria might not be 
fatal to a gnotobiotic, alien popu- 
lation. So you go.” 

“Colonel,” I said, “I’m sure that 
Washington didn’t give up the Zeta 
to us out of sheer altruism. What’s 
their real reason?” 

“Where else could we get a crew 
of twenty-eight men and women 
who’ve given proof they can live 
together for a long period of time, 
peaceably, retaining a fair degree 
of sanity? Miss Moss’s studies in 
group dynamics were most inter- 
esting to the Chief of Staff. Doubt- 
less they did much to influence his 
decision in your favor.” 

“There’s one thing I don’t un- 
derstand, Colonel Barrett.” 

“What’s that, Miss Damien?” 
he asked. 

“Why is it that you seem so un- 
happy about our being accepted as 
the Zeta’s crew?” she asked. “After 
all, you’ve been given the duty of 
training us to take her between 
stars. That’s a pretty important 
assignment, isn’t it, even for a bird 
colonel?” 

GALAXY 



“You’re right, Miss Damien,” 
Colonel Barrett said. “My new 
assignment is a vital one. You must 
forgive me if I seemed curt and 
unfriendly.” He paused. “I’ve been 
trying to hide my feelings, but evi- 
dently I failed. You see, Miss 
Damien, my wife and I had headed 
the previous list of volunteers — 
the contaminated crew.” 

L OOKING from the ports of the 
rocket that had brought us 
from Memorial Orbital Station, 
I’d thought von Weizsacker Crater 
the most impressive sight I’d ever 
seen. The Orion Zeta looked from 
our height like nothing so much as 
a miniature silver cocktail-shaker, 
glinting at the center of the vast 
circle of von Weizsacker. 

Later, standing a few hundred 
feet from Zeta’s base, I’d found the 
order of impressiveness reversed. 
The great ship was a tower of fif- 
teen hundred feet, blacking out the 
stars like a geometric mountain; 
while the crater’s twenty-thousand- 
foot ringwall, so far away in all 
directions, was no more obtrusive 
that a decorative hedge. This ship, 
I thought, is the intelligent comet 
on which we’d be passengers until 
the day we died, some two and a 
fraction light-years away from 
home. We were guaranteed immor- 
tality, though, in our offspring. Our 
descendants would very literally 
become flesh of our flesh, bone of 
our bone, as our bodies were re- 

WORLD IN A BOTTLE 



surrected to vegetable life in the 
hydroponic tanks of the ship. 

We Lapins clustered close to- 
gether on the moon-dust, staring 
up the sides of our ship. Her upper 
reaches were hidden by the globu- 
lar bulge of the enormous thrust- 
chamber, where kiloton capsules 
of nuclear fuel would be fired, 
three a second, to blast us into 
space. In this great ship our chil- 
dren would be born and would die, 
and our grandchildren as well. 
From the Zeta, our aged great- 
grandchildren, limping down long 
ladderways to the exit-hatches on 
the arms of their teen-aged grand- 
sons, would step onto the soil of a 
planet that circled Alpha Centauri. 

One hundred and twenty-five 
years from now, I thought, clasping 
the Firebird’s hand in mine. So 
little in history, so big in human 
lives! 

One hundred and twenty-five 
years ago, the Brooklyn Bridge 
had been brand-new. U.S. Grant, 
defrauded and cancer-ridden, was 
gritting his teeth against the pain 
to write his memoirs. President 
Chester A. Arthur had just signed 
into law a bill prohibiting poly- 
gamy in the territories. 

As far away as those things lay 
our goal. 

We entered the sublunarian 
chambers beneath the ship. Dr. 
McQueen had preceded us here; 
and under his direction the Orion 
Zeta had been made as aseptic as 



40 



41 




the Big Tank itself. Colonel Bar- 
rett and his subordinates who’d 
train us to operate the Zeta would 
have to wear sterility-suits aboard 
her, and would enter through the 
formaldehyde sump that was now 
her only entrance. Even the dust 
of the moon was not entirely 
sterile. 

The Firebird took my arm to 
urge me toward the liquid gateway 
to the ship, eager to see our new 
home. “Wait,” I said, holding her 
back till all the others had gone 
thrnucrh thp antisentic nool. 



“Cold feet, Johnny?” she teased 
me. 

“Gloria Moss once told me, Fire- 
bird, that a healthy respect for 
tradition is essential to the organic 
strength of a group such as ours,” 

I said. “So ...” I bent and picked 
the Firebird up, her weight moon- 
trimmed to that of a three-year-old. 
She put her arms around my neck 
as I carried her down the ladder 
into the poisonous decontamina- 
tion tank that was our front door ! 
to Alpha Centauri.

The Hills of Home 




T HE boy on the riverbank 
was named Kimmy. He was 
eleven, but he looked 
younger. He stood as though listen- 
ing to some distant sound. 

There was a tarnished nickel- 
plated faucet in his hand and a 
wooden sword had been thrust 
through the belt of his denim shorts. 

The river ran still and deep, gray 
and green in the eddies, with the 
smell of late summer rising out of 
the slow water. The madrone and 




Illustrated by DILLON 

willow trees stood limp in the early 
evening quiet. 

It wasn’t the Russian River. 

It was the Sacred Iss. 

The sun had touched the gem- 
encrusted cliffs of the shore of the 
Lost Sea of Korus and had van- 
ished, leaving only the stillness of 
dusk and the lonely cry of high fly- 
ing waterbirds. 

From downstream came the 
faint sound of music. It might have 
been a phonograph playing a Rudy 



THE HILLS OF HOME 



43 



Vallee record in one of the summer 
cabins with names like Pollyann 
Roost and Stumble Inn. But to 
Kimmy it was the hated cry of the 
Father of Therns, calling the dread- 
ful Plant Men to their feast of help- 
less pilgrims borne into this Valley 
of the Lost Sea of Korus by the 
mysterious Iss. 

Kimmy shifted the heavy Mar- 
tian radium pistol into his left hand 
and checked his harness. A soft 
smile touched his lips and he 
brushed a dark fall of hair out of his 
eyes. He was well armed. 

There was nothing he had to fear 
from the Plant Men. 

His bare feet turned upstream, 
away from the sound of the phono- 
graph, toward the shallows in the 
river that would permit him to 
cross and continue his search for 
Tars Tarkas along the base of the 
Golden Cliffs . 

r | ''HE Charge of Quarters said, 
-*• “Oh three hundred, Major. 
Briefing in thirty minutes.” 

Major Kimball tried to see him 
in the early morning gloom. He had 
not been asleep. It would have 
been wasteful to spend these last 
few hours sleeping. Instead, he had 
been remembering — 

He said, “All right, Sergeant. 
Coming up.” 

He swung his feet to the bare 
boards and sat for a moment wish- 
ing he hadn’t given up smoking. He 
could almost imagine the textured 



taste of the cigarette on his tongue. 

Oddly enough, he wasn’t tired. 
He wasn’t nervous or excited, 
either. And that was odder still. 

He stood up and opened the win- 
dow to look out at the velvet night 
of the Cape. He could hear the sea. 
Overhead the stars were bril- 
liant. Mars gleamed russet-colored 
against the sable night. He smiled, 
remembering again. So long a road 
from then to now. 

He stopped smiling and turned 
away from the window. The road 
had also been hard. Combat, test 
flying, competition all the way. The 
goddam headshrinkers were the 
toughest, always wanting him to 
bug out on the deal because of their 
brainwave graphs and word asso- 
ciation tests and Rorschach blots. 

“You’re a lonely man, Kimball.” 

“Too much imagination could be 
bad for this job.” 

Kimball shook his head and 
grinned slightly. You couldn’t 
blame them in a way. What was it 
like when a man sat there with 
pentothal in his veins and enceph- 
alograph electrodes on his head and 
told you about the still waters of 
Korus, or the pennons flying from 
the twin towers of Greater Helium, 
or the way the tiny slanting sun 
gleamed at dawn through the rig- 
ging of a flyer? 

Cry in the wilderness, head- 
shrinkers! He thought of them with 
satisfaction. There were five picked 
for Project Mercury. But only one 

GALAXY 



for Project Ares. Kimmy Kimball 
is going to Mars. No one else. 

He snapped on a light and looked 
at his watch. Oh three ten hours. 
Zero minus one fifty. 

He opened his steel locker and 
began to dress. 

T HE water swirled warm and 
velvety around his ankles. 
There, behind that madrone tree, 
Kimmy thought with delicious hor- 
ror. Was that a Plant Man? He 
could see the thick white trunk and 
the bloodsucking arms— 

The radium pistol’s weight made 
his wrist ache, but he clung to it 
tightly. He could not cope with a 
Plant Man with a sword alone. The 
certainty of coming battle made 
him smile a little, the way John 
Carter would smile if he were here 
in the Valley of Korus ready to at- 
tack the white Therns and their 
Plant Men. 

For a moment Kimmy felt a 
thrill of apprehension. The deepen- 
ing stillness of the riparian dusk 
was closing in all around him. Even 
the music of the phonograph was 
very, very faint. Above him, the 
great vault of the sky was chang- 
ing from pink to gray to dusty blue. 
A bright star was breaking through 
the curtain of fading light. He knew 
it was Venus, the Evening Star. But 
let it be Earth, he thought. And in- 
stead of white, let it be the color of 
an emerald. 

He paused in midstream, letting 
THE H ILLS OF HOME 



the warm water riffle around his 
feet. Looking up at the green bea- 
con of the planet of his birth, he 
thought: I’ve left all that behind 
me. I’m sorry about leaving mother 
and dad, but it was never really 
what I wanted. Mars is where I be- 
long. With my friends, John Car- 
ter the Warlord, Tars Tarkas the 
Great Green Jeddak, and all the 
beautiful brave people. 

The hated Father of Therns 
sang with Vallee’s voice: Come 
with me where southern skies will 
watch you with a million eyes — 

Kimmy’s eyes narrowed. 

He waded stealthily across the 
shallows of the Sacred Iss. He 
could see Matai Shang, the Them 
Father, resplendent in his jeweled 
harness and his yellow wig and 
Holy Diadem, spreading his arms 
out to the sunset. He stood safely 
in his balcony above the river while 
the Plant Men responded to his 
call. Were they gathering to attack 
Tars Tarkas or another band of 
helpless pilgrims? 

Matai Shang looked a little like 
Mr. Grossman standing on the 
verandah of his cottage. But that 
was all right. The dreadful Valley 
of Korus was wonderfully alive 
with adventure. It didn’t matter 
that Matai Shang looked like Mr. 
Grossman and sang like Rudy 
Vallee. 

Kimmy stepped cautiously ashore 
and moved into the cover of a 
clump of willows. The sky was 



44

darkening fast and soon someone 
was sure to start calling him. There 
wasn’t much time left. 

Tl/T AJOR Kimball stood now in 
-L"-®- the bright glare of the brief- 
ing bunker’s lights, a strange figure 
in G-suit and helmet. The repre- 
sentatives of the press had been 
handed their mimeographed re- 
leases by the PIO. Now they sat 
listening to the briefing being de- 
livered by General Hazel, the 
Project Officer. Occasionally Kim- 
ball would surprise one of the news- 
men looking at him with mixed ad- 
miration and doubt. Kimball knew 
what they were thinking. Why him? 
Out of all the applicants— and there 
are always applicants for a nearly- 
sure-death job — why this particu- 
lar one? 

Well, Kimball thought, why not? 
Maybe Project Ares was meant to 
be mine from the beginning. 

General Hazel talked, reading 
from the mimeographed sheet. He 
was skirting some highly sensitive 
areas. He spoke carefully and with- 
out expression, wishing he didn’t 
have to talk at all to these civilians. 

Kimball listened, only half 
aware of what was being said. He 
watched the faces of the men sit- 
ting on the rows of folding chairs, 
saw their eyes like wounds, red 
with sleeplessness and the celebra- 
tion last night at the Officers’ Club 
— the celebration in his honor that, 
of course, he hadn’t attended. 



On the dais nearby, listening to 
General Hazel but watching Kim- 
ball, sat Colonel Steinhart, the 
Project Psychiatrist. Kimball re- 
turned his steady gaze without 
flinching, inwardly amused. If I 
look away, he thought, Steinhart 
will write it down. The accumula- 
tion of trivia was the good doctor’s 
life work. Kimball felt sorry for 
him. It must be a bitter thing, he 
thought, to wish to know the hu- 
man mind and find only shadows. 
Stephen Crane once wrote: There 
is nothing but opinion — and opin- 
ion be damned. 

It was like that. 

The big clock on the wall of the 
bunker said oh three fifty-five. Zero 1 
minus one hour and five minutes. [ 
The countdown on the rocket had 
begun twenty -five minutes ago. No 
hold so far; none expected. 

Kimball looked around at the' 
red eyes and open mouths. What 
have I to do with you now? There 
are worse things than being alone. 

Outside the bunker, the night lay j 
warm and still over the base. Flood- i 
lights spilled brilliance over the| 
dunes and the scrubby palms, high 
fences casting laced shadows across 
the burning white expanses of fer- 
roconcrete. 

As the men filed out of the brief- 
ing room, Dr. Steinhart climbed 
into the command car with Kim- 
ball. Was it chance or design? The 
pilot wondered. The others were 
leaving them alone.

“We haven’t gotten on too well, 
have we, Major?” Steinhart said 
in a quiet voice. 

Kimball thought: He’s pale 

skinned and very blond. What is 
it that he reminds me of? Shouldn’t 
there be a diadem on his forehead? 

He smiled vaguely into the whis- 
pering night. That’s what it was. 
Odd that he should have forgotten. 
How many of my generation, he 
wondered, were raised on those 
Edgar Rice Burroughs books any- 
way? And how many remembered 
now that all the Them priests wore 
yellow wigs and a circlet of gold 
with some fantastic jewel on their 
foreheads? 

‘We’ve done as well as could be 
expected,” he said. 

CTEINHART reached for a ciga- 
^ rette and then stopped, re- 
membering that Kimball had given 
them up because of the Project. 
Kimball caught the doctor’s move- 
ment and half smiled. He’s good, 
the pilot thought. He’s very good. 
Friendly, compassionate, con- 
cerned. They probably taught him 
that in medical school. 

“I didn’t try to kill the assign- 
ment for you, Kim,” the doctor said. 

“Well, it doesn’t matter now." 

“No, I suppose not. I just don’t 
want you to think of me as an 
enemy.” 

Kimball shrugged. The bindings 
of his pressure suit creaked slightly. 

“Your record is good all the way. 



You know that,” Steinhart said. 
“It’s just some of the things—” 

Kimball said, “I talked too I 
much.” 

“You had to.” 

“You wouldn’t think my secret I 
life was so dangerous, woujd you?” 
Kimball said, smiling. 

The doctor made an impatient I 
gesture. “You won’t try to under- I 
stand.” 

Kimball shrugged. He didn’t I 
really care now. 

“I know you were married and ' 
divorced, Kim,” the doctor said. 
“Would you tell me what happened 
now?” 

“For the record? More therapy?” 

“No. This is for me. I’d like to | 
know.” 

The pilot shrugged again. “It just 
didn’t work. She was a fine girl, but | 
she finally told me it was no go.” 
And he remembered what she said. 
“You don’t live here, Kim.” That ! 
was a strange thing for a wife to say. 
But there was no point in telling 
Steinhart. He’d make something 
significant out of it. 

“She didn’t like the life,” Kim- 
ball said with finality. 

The doctor frowned. “She knew ; 
you were a career officer. What did 
she expect?” 

Kimball didn’t answer. He had j 
forgotten Steinhart already. He 
was looking out across the ramp at | 
the Project Ares launching pad. 

Dr. Steinhart sighed and said, “I [ 
wish you luck, Kim. I mean that.” j 

GALAXY 



“Thanks.” Kimball answered 
him across a widening gulf. 

“You’ll have a long, lonely wait 
for the next shoot,” Steinhart said. 

“I’ve got my instructions,” Kim- 
ball said. 

“Two years alone—” 

They are all so sure I’ll be alone, 
Kimball thought. He glanced up 
at the red planet low on the horizon 
and smiled. Amber smoke was ris- 
ing from the control bunker. It was 
now zero minus fifty-six minutes. 

ffl^IM,” Steinhart said slowly. 

Am. “There is something you 
should know about. Something you 
should be prepared for.” 

“Yes?” 

Disinterest in his voice, Stein- 
hart noted clinically. Natural un- 
der the circumstances? Or incipient 
neurosis already? If they had only 
listened to me, Steinhart thought. 

Steinhart continued, “Our tests 
showed you to be a schizoid — well 
compensated, of course. You know 
there is no such thing as an abso- 
lutely normal human being. We all 
have tendencies toward one or 
more types of aberration. In your 
case, the symptoms are an over- 
active imagination and sometimes 
an inability to distinguish reality 
from — well, fancy.” 

“You headshrinkers see a looney 
under every bush,” Kimball said 
vaguely. 

Steinhart felt futile and out of 
his depth. “No one is saying any- 

THE HILLS OF HOME 



thing about loonies, Kim. It’s just 
that we have so little data on the 
psychology of spaceflight.” 

“That’s what I’m supposed to 
provide, isn’t it, Colonel?” Kimball 
was looking up at the sky. 

“What I’m trying to say, Kim, is 
that a man of your type sometimes 
regresses—” 

“Doctor,” Kimball said patiently, 
“I passed all the tests.” 

Steinhart nodded reluctantly. 
“Yes. Yes, you did.” 

“Then let’s drop it, please.” 
Steinhart subsided into uncom- 
fortable silence. He listened to the 
rumble of the tires on the concrete, 
the murmur of the motor. I could 
be wrong, he thought. After all, 
what is reality? 

Reality was the rocket, towering 
in the floodlights, garishly painted 
in black and orange, against the 
first flickerings of the false dawn. 

1Z~IMMMY saw the girls before 
they saw him. In their new, 
low-waisted middies and skirts, 
they looked strange and out of 
place standing by the pebbled 
shore of the Sacred Iss. 

They were his sisters, Rose and 
Margaret, older than he at fifteen 
and seventeen. But they were walk- 
ing into the Valley of Korus and 
into danger. Behind him he could 
hear the rustle of the Plant Men as 
the evening breeze came up and 
touched the willows. 

“Kimm-eee— ” 



48 ’' 



49 



They were calling him. In the 
deepening dusk their voices carried 
far down the river. 

“Mr. Grossman, have you seen 
Kimmy?” 

The hated Father of Therns 
shrugged and pulled on his galluses. 
“Kimmm-eeee— !” 

Kimmy knew he should answer 
then, but he did not. Behind him 
he could hear the Plant Men ap- 
proaching. He shivered with de- 
licious horror. He stood very still 
and listened to his sisters talking, 
letting their voices carry into the 
clump of willows where he hid from 
the dangers of the Valley of the 
Lost Sea of Korus. 

“Where is that little brat, any- 
way?” 

“He always wanders off just at 
dinnertime and then we have to 
find him. It isn’t fair!” 

“Playing with that silly old fau- 
cet!” Cruel mimicry now. “My ray- 
dee-yum pistol—” 

“Oh, where is he anyway? Kimm- 
eee, you answer!” 

Something died in him. He tried 
hard to keep it alive. It wasn’t a fau- 
cet. It was a radium pistol! Tars 
Tarkas the Great Green Jeddak 
had given it to him himself! 

He looked at his sisters with dis- 
may. They weren’t really his sisters. 
They were Therns with their yel- 
low hair and pale skins. He and 
John Carter and Tars Tarkas had 
fought them many times, piling 
their bodies for barricades and 



weaving a pattern of skillful sword- 
points in the shifting light of the 
two moons. 

“Kimmmm— eee! We know you 
can hear us! Mom is going to be 
mad at you! Answer us, you hear?” 

If only Tars Tarkas would come 
now! If only the Great Green Jed- 
dak would come splashing across 
the stream on his huge thoat, his 
two swords clashing— 

“I see him! He’s hiding in that 
clump of willows!” 

“Kimmy, you come here this in- 
stant!” 

The Valley of Korus was fading, 
blurring. The Golden Cliffs were 
turning into sandy, worn riverbanks 
and the battlements and balconies 
were the verandahs of summer cot- 
tages. 

The faucet felt heavy in Kim- 
my’s grimy hand. He shivered— not 
with wonder now, with cold. 

He walked out of the willows, 
stumbling on the rocks. 

]tf AJOR Kimball lay like an 
embryo in the nose cone. 
Time was not. Time became the 
ticking of the timers and immense 
speed. 

He was thinking of that summer 
when the river lay still and deep 
under the hanging willows. Never 
before and never afterward had it 
held that same evocative magic. He 
remembered his sisters, thin and 
angular creatures as he recalled 
them through the eyes of an eleven-

GALAXY 



vea r-old. And his mother, tall and 
shadowy, standing on the screen- 
porch of the rented cottage and 
saying exasperatedly: “You worry 
us so running off like that, Kimmy!” 

He thought with vague amuse- 
ment: “I’ve really run off now.” 

It was good to dream of the low, 
beamed ceiling of the cottage and 
the thick close darkness of the sum- 
mer nights. Oh, there had been 
such longing. For something. 

What was it? A place, a time? 

Perhaps that. The place was a 
world of low red hills and a sky 
that burned deep blue through 
long, long days. And canals — yes, 
canals that were clear and still. And 
the time, what was the time? The 
time was youth. The time was to- 
morrow and yesterday. The time 
never was. 

But the place? 

Kimball thought with sudden 
wonder : I’m going to Mars! 

There were routine duties in the 
tiny cone. That way time slipped 
by as all around the missile spread 
the stunning, star-dusted night. 

TTE had been confined for nearly 
a hundred days when the de- 
scending orbital spiral began. The 
great ribbon parachute burst from 
the nose cone. 

Heat. Terrible heat and tum- 
bling blows. Kimball never knew 
when the cone landed. He lay for 
a long while, shocked and injured, 
but alive. 



In time he opened the shielded 
ports. 

He shrank from what he saw. 

Desolation! An eternity of waste- 
land. 

Red sands blowing across a sere 
and sterile plain. Emptiness. 

“I’m alone,” he murmured. 

The dry, icy wind plucked at the 
scored surfaces of the cone. 

He could feel panic clutching at 
him. The protective suit he wore 
seemed to press in on him, suffo- 
catingly. 

The wasteland beyond the port 
had been a wasteland for ten times 
ten million years. Kimball felt the 
weight of these years pressing on 
his sanity. 

He began to whimper softly. 

“Help me,” he said pleadingly. 
“Help me, Kimmy—” 

Something began to move on the 
great empty desert. 

Kimball cried out with joy and 
clawed desperately at the hatch. 

Suddenly the inner pressure 
jerked the valve from his hand and 
he plunged to the rusty sand, his 
ears cracking and his lungs gasping 
for air in the thin Martian atmo- 
sphere. His vision was cloudy and 
his head felt light. 

Something was moving on the 
plain. 

A shadowy cavalcade. 

Strange, monstrous men on fan- 
tastic war-mounts, long spears and 
fluttering pennons. Huge golden 
chariots with scythes flashing on 



THE HILLS OF HOME 



51 



the circling hubs, and armored 
giants — 

The figments of a long-remem- 
bered dream. 

He dropped to the sand and dug 
his hands into the dry, rusty soil. 
He fought to suck air into his labor- 
ing lungs. 

“Kimm-eeee!” 

A huge green warrior on a gray 
monster of a thoat was beckoning 
to him, pointing toward the low hills 
on the oddly near horizon. 

“Kimm-eeee!” 



The voice was thin and distant 
on the icy wind. Kimball knew that 
voice. 

He knew it from long ago in 
the Valley of Korus, by the shores 
of the mysterious sacred river. 

He came to his knees and then 
his feet, stumbling happily across 
the empty, lifeless plain. 

He knew the voice, he knew the 
man, and he knew the hills that he 
must reach before he died. 

They were the hills of home.

By MARSHALL KING 



P URNIE ran laughing and 
shouting through the forest 
until he could run no more. 
He fell headlong into a patch of 
blue moss and whooped with de- 
light in having this day free for ex- 
ploring. He was free to see the 
ocean at last. 

When he had caught his breath, 
he looked back through the forest. 
No sign of the village; he had left 



it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny 
of brothers and parents, there was 
nothing now to stop him from go- 
ing to the ocean. This was the mo- 
ment to stop time. 

“On your mark!” he shouted to 
the rippling stream and its orange 
whirlpools. He glanced furtively 
from side to side, pretending that 
some object might try to get a head 
start. “Get set!” he challenged the

It was a fine day at the beach 
for Purnie's game — but his new 

friends played very rough!

thin-winged bees that hovered over 
the abundant foliage. “Stop!” He 
shrieked this command upward to- 
ward the dense, low-hanging purple 
clouds that perenially raced across 
the treetops, making one wonder 
how tall the trees really were. 

His eyes took quick inventory. 
It was exactly as he knew it would 
be: the milky-orange stream had 
become motionless and its minute 
whirlpools had stopped whirling; a 
nearby bee hung suspended over a 
paka plant, its transparent wings 
frozen in position for a downward 
stroke; and the heavy purple fluid 
overhead held fast in its manufac- 
ture of whorls and nimbi. 

With everything around him in 
a state of perfect tableau, Purnie 
hurried toward the ocean. 

If only the days weren’t so short! 
he thought. There was so much to 
see and so little time. It seemed 
that everyone except him had seen 
the wonders of the beach country. 
The stories he had heard from his 
brothers and their friends had 
taunted him for as long as he could 
remember. So many times had he 
heard these thrilling tales that now, 
as he ran along, he could clearly 
picture the wonderland as though 
he were already there. There would 
be a rockslide of petrified logs to 
play on, the ocean itself with waves 
higher than a house, the comical 
three-legged tripons who never 
stopped munching on seaweed, and 
many kinds of other wonderful 
54 



creatures found only at the ocean. 

He bounced through the forest 
as though the world was reserved 
this day just for him. And who 
could say it wasn’t? he thought. 
Wasn’t this his fifth birthday? He 
ran along feeling sorry for four- 
year-olds, and even for those who 
were only four and a half, for they 
were babies and wouldn’t dare try 
slipping away to the ocean alone. 
But five! 

“I’ll set you free, Mr. Bee — just 
wait and see!” As he passed one of 
the many motionless pollen-gath- 
ering insects he met on the way, he 
took care not to brush against it or 
disturb its interrupted task. When 
Purnie had stopped time, the bees 
— like all the other creatures he 
met— had been arrested in their na- 
tive activities, and he knew that as 
soon as he resumed time, every- 
thing would pick up where it had 
left off. 

TJP7HEN he smelled an acid 
sweetness that told him the 
ocean was not far off, his pulse 
quickened in anticipation. Rather 
than spoil what was clearly going 
to be a perfect day, he chose to ig- 
nore the fact that he had been for- 
bidden to use time-stopping as a 
convenience for journeying far 
from home. He chose to ignore the 
oft-repeated statement that an 
hour of time-stopping consumed 
more energy than a week of foot- 
racing. He chose to ignore the nega- 

G A L AXY 



tive maxim that “small children 
who stop time without an adult be- 
ing present, may not live to regret 
it.” 

He chose, instead, to picture the 
beaming praise of family and 
friends when they learned of his 
brave journey. 

The journey was long, the clock 
stood still. He stopped long enough 
to gather some fruit that grew along 
the path. It would serve as his lunch 
during this day of promise. With it 
under his arm he bounded along 
a dozen more steps, then stopped 
abruptly in his tracks. 

He found himself atop a rocky 
knoll, overlooking the mighty sea! 

He was so overpowered by the 
vista before him that his “Hurrah!” 
came out as a weak squeak. The 
ocean lay at the ready, its stilled 
waves awaiting his command to 
resume their tidal sweep. The 
breakers along the shoreline hung 
in varying stages of disarray, some 
having already exploded into tow- 
ering white spray while others were 
poised in smooth orange curls wait- 
ing to start that action. 

And there were new friends 
everywhere! Overhead, a flock of 
spora were frozen in a steep glide, 
preparatory to a beach landing. 
Purnie had heard of these playful 
creatures many times. Today, with 
his brothers in school, he would 
have the pets all to himself. Fur- 
ther down the beach was a pair of 
two-legged animals poised in mid- 
BEACH SCENE 



step, facing the spot where Purnie 
now stood. Some distance behind 
them- were eight more, each of 
whom were motionless in a curious 
pose of interrupted animation. And 
down in the water, where the ocean 
ran itself into thin nothingness 
upon the sand, he saw standing 
here and there the comical tripons, 
those three-legged marine buffoons 
who made handsome careers of 
munching seaweed. 

“Hi there!” Purnie called. When 
he got no reaction, he remembered 
that he himself was “dead” to the 
living world: he was still in a zone 
of time-stopping, on the inside 
looking out. For him, the world 
would continue to be a tableau of 
mannikins until he resumed time. 

66"U" I there!” he called again; but 
now his mental attitude 
was that he expected time to re- 
sume. It did! Immediately he was 
surrounded by activity. He heard 
the roar of the crashing orange 
breakers, he tasted the dew of acid 
that floated from the spray, and 
he saw his new friends continue 
the actions which he had stopped 
while back in the forest. 

He knew, too, that at this mo- 
ment, in the forest, the little 
brook picked up its flow where it 
had left off, the purple clouds re- 
sumed their leeward journey up 
the valley, and the bees continued 
their pollen-gathering without hav- 
ing missed a single stroke of their 

55 



delicate wings. The brook, the 
clouds, and the insects had not 
been interrupted in the least; their 
respective tasks had been per- 
formed with continuing sureness. 
It was time itself that Purnie had 
stopped, not the world around him. 

He scampered around the rock- 
pile and down the sandy cliff to 
meet the tripons who, to him, had 
just come to life. 

“I can stand on my head!” He 
set down his lunch and balanced 
himself bottoms-up while his legs 
pawed the air in an effort to hold 
him in position. He knew it was 
probably the worst head-stand he 
had ever done, for he felt weak 
and dizzy. Already time-stopping 
had left its mark on his strength. 
But his spirits ran on unchecked. 

The tripon thought Purnie’s feat 
was superb. It stopped munching 
long enough to give him a salutory 
wag of its rump before returning to 
its repast. 

Purnie ran from pillar to post, 
trying to see and do everything at 
once. He looked around to greet the 
flock of spora, but they had glided 
to a spot further along the shore. 
Then, bouncing up to the first of the 
two-legged animals, he started to 
burst forth with his habitual “Hi 
there!” when he heard them mak- 
ing sounds of their own. 

“. will be no limit to my oper- 
ations now, Benson. This planet 
makes seventeen. Seventeen plan- 
ets I can claim as my own!” 

56 



“My, my. Seventeen planets. 
And tell me, Forbes, just what the 
hell are you going to do with them 
— mount them on the wall of your 
den back in San Diego?” 

“Hi there, wanna play?” Pumie’s 
invitation got nothing more than a 
startled glance from the animals 
who quickly returned to their chat- 
ter. He scampered up the bench, 
picked up his lunch, and ran back 
to them, tagging along at their 
heels. “I’ve got my lunch, want 
some?” 

“Benson, you’d better tell your 
men back there to stop gawking at 
the scenery and get to work. Time 
is money. I didn’t pay for this ex- 
pedition just to give your flunkies 
a vacation.” 

' 1 1 HE animals stopped so sudden- 
ly that Purnie nearly tangled 
himself in their heels. 

“All right, Forbes, just hold it a 
minute. Listen to me. Sure, it’s your 
money that put us here; it’s your 
expedition all the way. But you 
hired me to get you here with the 
best crew on earth, and that’s just 
what I’ve done. My job isn’t over 
yet. I’m responsible for the safety 
of the men while we’re here, and 
for the safe trip home.” 

“Precisely. And since you’re 
responsible, get ’em working. Tell 
’em to bring along the flag. Look 
at the damn fools back there, play- 
ing in the ocean with a three-legged 
ostrich!”

“Good God, man, aren’t you hu- 
man? We’ve only been on this 
planet twenty minutes! Naturally 
they want to look around. They 
half expected to find wild animals 
or worse, and here we are sur- 
rounded by quaint little creatures 
that run up to us like we’re long- 
lost brothers. Let the men look 
around a minute or two before we 
stake out your claim.” 

“Bah! Bunch of damn children.” 

As Purnie followed along, a leg 
shot out at him and missed. “Ben- 
son, will you get this bug-eyed kan- 
garoo away from me!” Purnie 
shrieked with joy at this new frolic 
and promptly stood on his head. In 
this position he got an upside down 
view of them walking away. 

He gave up trying to stay with 
them. Why did they move so fast, 
anyway? What was the hurry? As 
he sat down and began eating his 
lunch, three more of the creatures 
came along making excited noises, 
apparently trying to catch up to the 
first two. As they passed him, he 
held out his lunch. “Want some?” 
No response. 

Playing held more promise than 
eating. He left his lunch half eaten 
and went down to where they had 
stopped further along the beach. 

“Captain Benson, sir! Miles has 
detected strong radiation in the 
vicinity. He’s trying to locate it 
now.” 

“There you are, Forbes. Your 
new piece of real estate is going to 
58 



make you so rich that you can buy 
your next planet. That’ll mak« 
eighteen, I believe.” 

“Radiation, bah! We’ve found 
low-grade ore on every planet I’ve 
discovered so far, and this one’ll be 
no different Now how about that 
flag? Let’s get it up, Benson. And 
the cornerstone, and the plaque . 11 

“All right, lads. The sooner we 
get Mr. Forbes’s pennant raised 
and his claim staked out, the 
sooner we can take time to look 
around. Lively now!” 

HEN the three animals went 
back to join the rest of theii 
group, the first two resumed walk- 
ing: Purnie followed along. 

‘Well, Benson, you won’t have 
to look far for materials to use for 
the base of the flag pole. Look at 
that rockpile up there. 

“Can’t use them. They’re petri- 
fied logs. The ones on top are too 
high to carry down, and if we move 
those on the bottom, the whole 
works will slide down on top of us.” 
‘Well— that’s your problem. Just 
remember, I want this flag pole to 
be solid. It’s got to stand at least—" 
“Don’t worry, Forbes, we’ll get 
your monument erected. What’s 
this with the flag? There must be 
more to staking a claim than just 
putting up a flag.” 

“There is, there is. Much more. 
I’ve taken care of all requirements 
set down by law to make my claim. 
But the flag? Well, you might say 
GALAXY 



jt represents an empire, Benson. 
The Forbes Empire. On each of 
my flags is the word FORBES, a 
symbol of development and prog- 
ress. Call it sentiment if you will.” 
“Don’t worry, I won’t. I’ve seen 
real-estate flags before.” 

“Damn it all, will you stop refer- 
ring to this as a real-estate deal? 
What I’m doing is big, man. Big! 
This is pioneering.” 

“Of course. And if I’m not mis- 
taken, you’ve set up a neat little 
escrow system so that you not only 
own the planets, but you will vir- 
tually own the people who are fool- 
ish enough to buy land on them.” 

“I could have your hide for talk- 
ing to me like this. Damn you, man! 
It’s people like me who pay your 
way. It’s people like me who give 
your space ships some place to go. 
It’s people like me who pour good 
money into a chancey job like this, 
so that people like you can get 
away from thirteen-story tenement 
houses. Did you ever think of 
that?” 

“I imagine you’ll triple your 
money in six months.” 

When they stopped, Purnie 
stopped. At first he had been inter- 
ested in the strange sounds they 
were making, but as he grew used 
to them, and as they in turn ignored 
his presence, he hopped alongside 
chattering to himself, content to be 
in their company. 

He heard more of these sounds 
coming from behind, and he turned 

BEACH SCENE 



to see the remainder of the group 
running toward them. 

“Captain Benson! Here’s the flag, 
sir. And here’s Miles with the scin- 
tillometer. He says the radiation’s 
getting stronger over this way!” 
“How about that, Miles?” 

“This thing’s going wild, Cap- 
tain. It’s almost off scale.” 

13 URNIE saw one of the animals 
hovering around him with a 
little box. Thankful for the atten- 
tion, he stood on his head. “Can you 
do this?” He was overjoyed at the 
reaction. They all started making 
wonderful noises, and he felt most 
satisfied. 

“Stand back, Captain! Here’s the 
source right here! This little chuck- 
walla’s hotter than a plutonium 
pile!” 

“Let me see that, Miles. Well, 
I’ll be damned! Now what do you 
suppose—” 

By now they had formed a wi- 
dening circle around him, and he 
was hard put to think of an encore. 
He gambled on trying a brand new 
trick: he stood on one leg. 

“Benson, I must have that ani- 
mal! Put him in a box.” 

“Now wait a minute, Forbes. 
Universal Law forbids—” 

“This is my planet and I am the 
law. Put him in a box!” 

“With my crew as witness, I offi- 
cially protest—” 

“Good God, what a specimen to 
take back. Radio-active animals! 




59 



Why, they can reproduce them- 
selves, of course! There must be 
thousands of these creatuf es around 
here someplace. And to think of 
those damn fools on Earth with 
their plutonium piles! Hah! Now 
I’ll have investors flocking to me. 
How about it, Benson — does pio- 
neering pay off or doesn’t it?” 
“Not so fast. Since this little fel- 
low is radioactive, there may be 
great danger to the crew—” 

“Now look here! You had 
planned to put mineral specimens 
in a lead box, so what’s the differ- 
ence? Put him in a box.” 

“He’ll die.” 

“I have you under contract, Ben- 
son! You are responsible to me, and 
what’s more, you are on my proper- 
ty. Put him in a box.” 

Pumie was tired. First the time- 
stopping, then this. While this day 
had brought more fun and excite- 
ment than he could have hoped for, 
the strain was beginning to tell. He 
lay in the center of the circle hap- 
pily exhausted, hoping that his 
friends would show him some of 
their own tricks. 

He didn’t have to wait long. The 
animals forming the circle stepped 
back and made way for two others 
who came through carrying a box. 
Purnie sat up to watch the show. 

“Hell, Captain, why don’t I just 
pick him up? Looks like he has no 
intention of running away.” 

“Better not, Cabot. Even though 
you’re shielded, no telling what 
60 



powers the little fella has. Play it 
safe and use the rope.” 

“I swear he knows what we’re 
saying. Look at those eyes.” 

“All right, careful now with that 
line.” 

“Come on, baby. Here you go. 
That’s a boy!” 

TJURNIE took in these sounds 
with perplexed concern. He 
sensed the imploring quality of the 
creature with the rope, but he didn’t 
know what he was supposed to do. 
He cocked his head to one side as 
he wiggled in anticipation. 

He saw the noose spinning down 
toward his head, and, before he 
knew it, he had scooted out of the 
circle and up the sandy beach. He 
was surprised at himself for run- 
ning away. Why had he done it? He 
wondered. Never before had he felt 
this fleeting twinge that made him 
want to protect himself. 

He watched the animals huddle 
around the box on the beach, their 
attention apparently diverted to 
something else. He wished now that 
he had not run away; he felt he had 
lost his chance to join in their fun. 

“Wait!” He ran over to his half- 
eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran 
back into the little crowd. “I’ve got 
my lunch, want some?” 

The party came to life once 
more. His friends ran this way and 
that, and at last Purnie knew that 
the idea was to get him into the box. 
He picked up the spirit of the tease, 
GALAXY 



and deliberately ran within a few 
feet of the lead box, then, just as 
the nearest pursuer was about to 
push him in, he sidestepped onto 
safer ground. Then he heard a deaf- 
ening roar and felt a warm, wet 
sting in one of his legs. 

“Forbes, you fool! Put away that 
gun!” 

“There you are, boys. It’s all in 
knowing how. Just winged him, 
that’s all. Now pick him up.” 

The pang in his leg was nothing: 
purnie’s misery lay in his confusion. 
What had he done wrong? When 
he saw the noose spinning toward 
him again, he involuntarily stopped 
time. He knew better than to use 
this power carelessly, but his ac- 
tion now was reflex. In that split 
second following the sharp sting in 
his leg, his mind had grasped in all 
directions to find an acceptable 
course of action. Finding none, it 
had ordered the stoppage of time. 

The scene around him became 
a tableau once more. The noose 
hung motionless over his head 
while the rest of the rope snaked 
its way in transverse waves back to 
one of the two-legged animals. Pur- 
nie dragged himself through the 
congregation, whimpering from his 
inability to understand. 

As he worked his way past one 
creature after another, he tried at 
first to not look them in the eye, 
for he felt sure he had done some- 
thing wrong. Then he thought that 
by sneaking a glance at them as he 
BEACH SCENE 



passed, he might see a sign point- 
ing to their purpose. He limped by 
one who had in his hand a small 
shiny object that had been emit- 
ing smoke from one end; the smoke 
now billowed in lifeless curls about 
the animal’s head. He hobbled by 
another who held a small box that 
had previously made a hissing 
sound whenever Purnie was near. 
These things told him nothing. Be- 
fore starting his climb up the knoll, 
he passed a tripon which, true to its 
reputation, was comical even in 
fright. Startled by the loud explo- 
sion, it had jumped four feet into 
the air before Purnie had stopped 
time. Now it hung there, its beak 
stuffed with seaweed and its three 
legs drawn up into a squatting po- 
sition. 

Leaving the assorted statues be- 
hind, he limped his way up the 
knoll, torn between leaving and 
staying. What an odd place, this 
ocean country! He wondered why 
he had not heard more detail about 
the beach animals. 

Reaching the top of the bluff, he 
looked down upon his silent friends 
with a feeling of deep sorrow. How 
he wished he were down there play- 
ing with them. But he knew at last 
that theirs was a game he didn’t fit 
into. Now there was nothing left 
but to resume time and start the 
long walk home. Even though the 
short day was nearly over, he knew 
he didn’t dare use time-stopping to 
get himself home in nothing flat. 

61 



His fatigued body and clouded 
mind were strong signals that he 
had already abused this faculty. 

VjfTHEN Purnie started time 
" again, the animal with the 
noose stood in open-mouthed dis- 
belief as the rope fell harmlessly to 
the sand — on the spot where Pur- 
nie had been standing. 

“My God, he’s — he’s gone.” 
Then another of the animals, the 
one with the smoking thing in his 
hand, ran a few steps toward the 
noose, stopped and gaped at the 
rope. “All right, you people, what’s 
going on here? Get him in that box. 
What did you do with him?” 

The resumption of time meant 
nothing at all to those on the beach, 
for to them time had never stopped. 
The only thing they could be sure 
of was that at one moment there 
had been a fuzzy creature hopping 
around in front of them, and the 
next moment he was gone. 

“Is he invisible, Captain? Where 
is he?” 

“Up there, Captain! On those 
rocks. Isn’t that him?” 

“Well, I’ll be damned!” 
“Benson, I’m holding you per- 
sonally responsible for this! Now 
that you’ve botched it up, I’ll bring 
him down my own way.” 

“Just a minute, Forbes, let me 
think. There’s something about 
that fuzzy little devil that we 
should . Forbes! I warned you 
about that gun!” 

62 



Purnie moved across the top of 
the rockpile for a last look at his 
friends. His weight on the end of 
the first log started the slide. Slow- 
ly at first, the giant pencils began 
cascading down the short distance 
to the sand. Purnie fell back onto 
solid ground, horrified at the spec- 
tacle before him. The agonizing 
screams of the animals below filled 
him with hysteria. 

The boulders caught most of 
them as they stood ankle-deep in 
the surf. Others were pinned down 
on the sand. 

“I didn’t mean it!” Purnie 
screamed. “I’m sorry! Can’t you 
hear?” He hopped back and forth 
near the edge of the rise, torn with 
panic and shame. “Get up! Please 
get up!” He was horrified by the 
moans reaching his ears from the 
beach. “You’re getting all wet! Did 
you hear me? Please get up.” He 
was choked with rage and sorrow. 
How could he have done this? He 
wanted his friends to get up and 
shake themselves off, tell him it 
was all right. But it was beyond his 
power to bring it about. 

The lapping tide threatened to 
cover those in the orange surf. 

"D URNIE worked his way down 
the hill, imploring them to save 
themselves. The sounds they made 
carried a new tone, a desperate 
foreboding of death. 

“Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear 
me?” 



GALAXY 



«J — I can’t move, Captain. My 
leg, it’s . My God, we’re going to 
drown!” 

“Look around you, Cabot. Can 
you see anyone moving?” 

“The men on the beach are near- 
ly buried, Captain. And the rest of 
us here in the water—” 

“Forbes. Can you see Forbes? 
Maybe he’s—” His sounds were cut 
off by a wavelet gently rolling over 
his head. 

Purnie could wait no longer. The 
tides were all but covering one of 
the animals, and soon the others 
would be in the same plight. Dis- 
regarding the consequences, he or- 
dered time to stop. 

Wading down into the surf, he 
worked a log off one victim, then he 
tugged the animal up to the sand. 
Through blinding tears, Purnie 
worked slowly and carefully. He 
knew there was no hurry — at least, 
not as far as his friends’ safety was 
concerned. No matter what their 
condition of life or death was at 
this moment, it would stay the 
same way until he started time 
again. He made his way deeper into 
the orange liquid, where a raised 
hand signalled the location of a sub- 
merged body. The hand was clutch- 
ing a large white banner that was 
tangled among the logs. Purnie 
worked the animal free and pulled 
it ashore. 

It was the one who had been 
carrying the shiny object that spit 
smoke. 



Scarcely noticing his own in- 
jured leg, he ferried one victim 
after another until there were no 
more in the surf. Up on the beach, 
he started unraveling the logs that 
pinned down the animals caught 
there. He removed a log from the 
lap of one, who then remained in 
a sitting position, his face con- 
torted into a frozen mask of agony 
and shock. Another, with the 
weight removed, rolled over like an 
iron statue into a new position. Pur- 
nie whimpered in black misery as 
he surveyed the chaotic scene be- 
fore him. 

At last he could do no more; he 
felt consciousness slipping away 
from him. 

He instinctively knew that if he 
lost his senses during a period of 
time-stopping, events would pick 
up where they had left off . with- 
out him. For Purnie, this would be 
death. If he had to lose conscious- 
ness, he knew he must first resume 
time. 

Step by step he plodded up the 
little hill, pausing every now and 
then to consider if this were the 
moment to start time before it was 
too late. With his energy fast drain- 
ing away, he reached the top of the. 
knoll, and he turned to look down 
once more on the group below. 

Then he knew how much his 
mind and body had suffered : when 
he ordered time to resume, nothing 
happened. 

His heart sank. He wasn’t afraid 

63 



BEACH SCENE 



of death, and he knew that if he 
died the oceans would roll again 
and his friends would move about. 
But he wanted to see them safe. 

He tried to clear his mind for 
supreme effort. There was no urg- 
ing time to start. He knew he 
couldn’t persuade it by bits and 
pieces, first slowly then full ahead. 
Time either progressed or it didn’t. 
He had to take one viewpoint or 
the other. 

Then, without knowing exactly 
when it happened, his mind took 
command . 

TTIS friends came to life. The 
first one he saw stir lay on his 
stomach and pounded his fists on 
the beach. A flood of relief settled 
over Purnie as sounds came from 
the animal. 

“What’s the matter with me? 
Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? 
Miles! Schick! What’s happening?” 
“I’m coming, Rhodes! Heaven 
help us, man — I saw it, too. We’re 
either crazy or those damn logs are 
alive!” 

“It’s not the logs. How about us? 
How’d we get out of the water? 
Miles, we’re both cracking.” 

“I’m telling you, man, it’s the 
logs, or rocks or whatever they are. 
I was looking right at them. First 
they’re on top of me, then they’re 
piled up over there!” 

“Darnnit, the logs didn’t pick us 
up out of the ocean, did they? Cap- 
tain Benson!” 

64 



“Are you men all right?' 

“Yes sir, but-” 

“Who saw exactly what hap- 
pened?” 

“I’m afraid we’re not seeing 
right, Captain. Those logs—” 

“I know, I know. Now get hold 
of yourselves. We’ve got to round 
up the others and get out of here 
while time is on our side.” 

“But what happened, Captain?” 
“Hell, Rhodes, don’t you think 
I’d like to know? Those logs are 
so old they’re petrified. The whole 
bunch of us couldn’t lift one. It 
would take super-human energy to 
move one of those things.” 

“I haven’t seen anything super- 
human. Those ostriches down there 
are so busy eating seaweed—” 
“All right, let’s bear a hand here 
with the others. Some of them can’t 
walk. Where’s Forbes?” 

“He’s sitting down there in the 
water, Captain, crying like a baby. 
Or laughing. I can’t tell which.” 
“We’ll have to get him. Miles, 
Schick, come along. Forbes! You 
all right?” 

“Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seven- 
teen! Seventeen planets, Benson, 
and they’ll do anything I say! This 
one’s got a mind of its own. Did 
you see that little trick with the 
rocks? Ho-ho!” 

“See if you can find his gun, 
Schick; he’ll either kill himself or 
one of us. Tie his hands and take 
him back to the ship. We’ll be along 
shortly.” 

GALAXY 



“Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Ben- 
son, I’m holding you personally 
responsible for this. Hee-hee!” 

P URNIE opened his eyes as 
consciousness returned. Had 
his friends gone? 

He pulled himself along on his 
stomach to a position between two 
rocks, where he could see without 
being seen. By the light of the twin 
moons he saw that they were leav- 
ing, marching away in groups of 
two and three, the weak helping 
the weaker. As they disappeared 
around the curving shoreline, the 
voices of the last two, bringing up 
the rear far behind the others, fell 
faintly on his ears over the sound 
of the surf. 

“Is it possible that we’re all 
crazy, Captain?” 

“It’s possible, but we’re not.” 

“I wish I could be sure.” 

“See Forbes up ahead there? 
What do you think of him?” 

“I still can’t believe it.” 

“He’ll never be the same.” 

“Tell me something. What was 
the most unusual thing you noticed 
back there?” 

“You must be kidding, sir. Why, 
the way those logs were off of us 
suddenly—” 

“Yes, of course. But I mean be- 
side that.” 

“Well, I guess I was kind of busy. 
You know, scared and mixed up.” 
“But didn’t you notice our little 
pop-eyed friend?” 

BEACH SCENE 



“Oh, him. I’m afraid not, Cap- 
tain. I — I guess I was thinking 
mostly of myself.” 

“Hmmm. If I could only be sure 
I saw him. If only someone else 
saw him too.” 

“I’m afraid I don’t follow you, 
sir.” 

“Well, damn it all, you know that 
Forbes took a pot shot at him. Got 
him in the leg. That being the case, 
why would the fuzzy little devil 
come back to his tormentors— back 
to us — when we were trapped un- 
der those logs?” 

“Well, I guess as long as we were 
trapped, he figured we couldn’t do 
him any more harm . I’m sorry, 
that was a stupid answer. I guess 
I’m still a little shaky.” 

“Forget it. Look, you go ahead to 
the ship and make ready for take- 
off. I’ll join you in a few minutes. 
I think I’ll go back and look around. 
You know. Make sure we haven’t 
left anyone.” 

“No need to do that. They’re all 
ahead of us. I’ve checked.” 

“That’s my responsibility, Cabot, 
not yours. Now go on.” 

A S Purnie lay gathering strength 
J -~*- for the long trek home, he saw 
through glazed eyes one of the ani- 
mals coming back along the beach. 
When it was nearly directly below 
him, he could hear it making sounds 
that by now had become familiar. 

“Where are you?” 

Purnie paid little attention to 

65 



the antics of his friend; he was be- 
yond understanding. He wondered 
what they would say at home when 
he returned. 

“We’ve made a terrible mistake. 
We—” The sounds faded in and out 
on Purnie’s ears as the creature 
turned slowly and called in differ- 
ent directions. He watched the ani- 
mal walk over to the pile of scat- 
tered logs and peer around and un- 
der them. 

“If you’re hurt I’d like to help!” 
The twin moons were high in the 
sky now, and where their light 



broke through the swirling clouds 
a double shadow was cast around 
the animal. With foggy awareness, 
Purnie watched the creature shake 
its head slowly, then walk away in 
the direction of the others. 

Purnie’s eyes stared, without see- 
ing, at the panorama before him. 
The beach was deserted -now, and 
his gaze was transfixed on a shim- 
mering white square floating on the 
ocean. Across it, the last thing Pur- 
nie ever saw, was emblazoned the 
word FORBES.

THE AIR ON THE MOON 

I T WAS a very clear, very 
cold night in Texas as we 
walked across the campus. 
A nearly full Moon was 
straight overhead and we stop- 
ped for a moment to look at 
it. “Gosh,” said one of the girls, 
it’s so clear you can actually 
see there is no air on the Moon!” 
And that is, of course, what 
every textbook since Giovanni 
Battista Riccioli’s Almagestum 
novum of 1651 has said: there 
is no air on the Moon. And when 
modem astronomers speak about 



HE AIR ON THE MOON 



67 






a “lunar atmosphere,” they are 
not contradicting this idea, even 
if it may seem so at first glance. 
It all depends on your definition. 
If by “atmosphere” you mean 
something that you can breathe 
and which exerts enough pres- 
sure on your body to keep the 
body fluids liquid, then the Moon 
has no atmosphere. But if your 
definition of atmosphere is more 
scientific — a collection of free 
molecules of gases on the surface 
of a body of planetary or near- 
planetary mass — then the Moon 
does have an atmosphere. 

It is, in fact, a very special 
atmosphere, consisting exclu- 
sively (we think) of those gases 
which are collectively referred 
to as “rare gases” or, sometimes, 
as “noble gases.” The first of 
these terms needs no explana- 
tion; they are rare. The second 
term, used in Europe, refers to 
the fact that they do not combine 
with anything to form any chem- 
ical compounds; they do not, you 
see, associate with the common 
elements. Why, they are so 
“noble” that they do not even 
associate with each other! 

Just to be thorough, I have to 
add that there are American 
chemists who call them “the inert 
gases.” There is some justifica- 
tion for this because the name 
of one of them, argon, is the 
Greek word for “lazy” or, more 
politely, “inert.” However, the 




Radon was originally named 
Niton (shining), but the name 
was later changed to indicate 
its close relationship to radium. 



term is rather misleading because 
some ordinary gases such as 
nitrogen or carbon dioxide can 
be rather inert too, depending 
on circumstances, and are so 
called in industry. To call the 
rare gases inert gases can (and 
in the classroom does ) lead to 
misunderstandings. 

For reasons which will become 
apparent in a moment, it is 
necessary to give a table of these 
gases, together with their atomic 
weight. 



Name Meaning 

Helium (He) sun 
Neon (He) new 
Argon (A) inert 
Krypton (Kr) hidden 
Xenon (Xe) stranger 
Radon (Rn) 



rpHE REASON for giving the 
weights is this: As the tem- 
perature increases, the velocity 
of the molecules (or atoms) of 
a gas increases, too, and for a 
given temperature the lighter 
gases have, of course, higher 
velocities. 

Since the escape velocity of 
the Moon is not very high — 
1.5 miles per second — the

molecules (or atoms) can reach 
this escape velocity if the tem- 
perature is high enough. Then 
they will simply depart for 
unspecified points somewhere in 
space, the lighter gases first. The 
surface temperature on the Moon 
can be 135° centigrade (275° 
Fahrenheit) and a useful rule, 
first stated by Dr. Harold C. 
Urey, is that it will not be able 
to hold onto anything with an 
atomic weight less than 60. 
Now this seems to restrict the 
list of the gases which could 
stay at the Moon’s surface to the 
last three, but radon is a kind of 
theoretical case only. It is radio- 
active with a half-life of only 
3.85 days, so that it disappears 
for reasons of its own. 

In reality, then, the Moon can 
hold krypton and xenon. 

Theoretical reasoning says 
that it should be mostly xenon, 
because xenon-129 must be 
produced steadily from the radio- 
active isotope of iodine, iodine- 
129. The number of xenon atoms 
produced per second on the 
Moon must be about 5000 
million. The production rate of 
krypton is far lower, so that the 
lunar “atmosphere” would be 
likely to consist of 95 per cent 
xenon and 5 per cent krypton. 

Radioactive processes always 
produce helium at fairly high 
rates, but helium is too light to 
be kept by the Moon. Neon is 



also too light, but argon is an 
interesting borderline case. Its 
weight is about 40, which is 
lighter than the lower limfl 
postulated by Dr. Urey. On the 
other hand, that figure of 275' 
Fahrenheit is rather high and so 
might the production rate of 
argon be. The source of argon 
would be the radioactive isotope 
of potassium, potassium-40. 

As Dr. Isaac Asimov pointed 
out, 3600 grams of potassium-40 
are likely to decay every second. 
Eleven per cent of this potassium- 
40 turns into argon-40 (the 
remainder becomes calcium-40) 
which means a production per 
second of nearly 400 grams (close 
to 14 ounces) of argon-40. Even 
though a good percentage of this 
argon must dissipate in space, 
these figures indicate that the 
lunar atmosphere should be 
composed of argon, krypton and 
xenon. 

Possibly traces of another gas 
must be added, carbon dioxide. 
Last year the Russians observed 
a phenomenon on the Moon 
which they described as a vol- 
canic eruption. English and 
American astronomers did not 
doubt the observation itself, but 
inclined to the belief that it was 
a carbon dioxide outbreak, which 
carried surface dust up with it 
and therefore looked more sub- 
stantial than it really was. 

Now the molecular weight of 



70 



GALAXY 



carbon dioxide is 44, just about 
the same as argon. Therefore the 
same reasoning applies to it, 
t, u t the question mark is the 
production rate. The only source 
of carbon dioxide on the Moon 
w ould be volcanism — and the 
most anybody can say about this 
is that there might be some 
lunar volcanic activity left — 
with fairly much emphasis on 
the word “might.” 

How high this highly attenu- 
ated mixture of xenon and 
krypton with some argon and 
possibly some carbon dioxide ex- 
tends is a question which can 
cause a long and inconclusive 
debate. At any event, the idea 
of catching some with a closely 
orbiting rocket is not feasible. It 
will need a soft landing of an 
instrument capsule to find out. 

GALILEO GALILEI AND THE 
LEANING CAMPANILE OF PISA 

AT ONE TIME early in his 
-‘■■career, Galileo Galilei grew 
very doubtful about the idea that 
had come down from Aristotle, 
namely that the speed of falling 
objects varies in accordance with 
their weight. That, for example, 
an object weighing ten pounds 
will fall ten times as fast as an 
object weighing only one pound. 

Galileo Galilei was at that 
time professor at Pisa, the city 
of the famous leaning tower 



(which was and is called the 
Campanile), and one day in 
1590, he assembled his pupils 
and as many of the faculty as he 
could round up at the foot of the 
Campanile and he dropped a 
cannon ball and a musket ball 
from the top of the tower. They 
struck the ground simultaneously 
and from that day on Aristotelian 
teachings were disbelieved. 

Of course it’s a familiar story. 
It can be found in all books on 
Galilei and any popular book 
dealing with the history of 
science. 

A few months ago, however, I 
received a letter from a Mr. 
Cockroft in New Zealand who 
had come across an article in an 
American magazine in which it 
was loudly stated that this 
“whole silly story” had been in- 
vented by an English writer by 
the name of R. A. Gregory in a 
book published in London in 
1917, but had since been 
thoroughly disproved by Lane 
Cooper, Professor of English at 
Cornell University. 

When the letter arrived I hap- 
pened to be on a long lecture 
tour on the West Coast. All I 
could do at the moment was 
write a letter in reply, promising 
to check the facts as soon as I 
could. I also ordered a copy of 
Professor Cooper’s book. 

For the rest of the lecture tour 
I wasn’t quite happy. I had used 



THE AIR ON THE MOON

the story of Galileo Galilei’s ex- 
periment from the leaning tower 
myself, but because it had been 
a minor incident in my case, I 
had not specially checked on it. 
While flying to my next engage- 
ment I tried to remember what 
Galilei himself had said in his 
famous Dialogues . concerning 
Two New Sciences. He did use the 
famous argument there that the 
Aristotelian concept was illogical. 
If a larger stone fell faster than 
a smaller one, what would hap- 
pen if the two were tied together? 
Would they fall still faster be- 
cause they weighed more? Or 
would the lighter stone hamper 
the movement of the heavier one? 
I seemed to remember that he 
had spoken of experiments. 

A FEW lectures later I had 
-^■-dinner in the home of a 
gentleman who had a large 
library. Yes, a biography of 
Galilei was among his books and 
it contained the story of the 
leaning tower and stated that 
Galilei (who was then about 26 
years old) had not published 
anything while at Pisa. My host 
remarked, after I told him about 
the inquiry I had received, that 
the original source was probably 
buried in a volume with a title 
like “Correspondence between 
Galileo Galilei and So-and-so” 
— such letter collections are al- 
ways a treasure for biographers 



but a nuisance for a man who 
wants to find something in a 
hurry. For this reason we didn’t 
even try the university library 
the next morning, though there 
would have been time to do so. 

If this were a story, I would 
have Professor Cooper’s book 
waiting for me when I came 
home. Since this isn’t a story, it 
was not. I went on two more 
lecture tours and forgot all 
about it. But then Professor 
Cooper’s book (entitled: Aris- 
totle, Galileo and the Tower of 
Pisa) did come and a week or 
so later I got around to reading 
it. 

It is a most careful work, 
quoting all the sources in their 
original tongues as well as in 
translation. That the general 
feeling of confusion emerges 
from its pages is not Professor 
Cooper’s fault. The story itself 
is confused. 

To make it as clear as cir- 
cumstances permit, let us examine 
•the whole thing piecemeal, be- 
ginning with what Aristotle said. 
“An iron ball of one hundred 
pounds, falling from a height of 
one hundred cubits, reaches the 
ground before a one-pound ball 
has fallen a single cubit.” But 
these are Galilei’s words (from 
the Dialogues) and not the words 
of Aristotle. Then what did 
Aristotle himself say? Well, find- 
ing that out is not so simple. 



72 



GALAXY 



Aristotle did not write system- 
atically about motions and fall, 
which is to say he did not 
develop a theory of his own. He 
was arguing against the atomists, 
whom he disliked, and his state- 
ments are meant to show how 
wrong they were. However, there 
is one sentence which seems to 
be the one Galilei had in mind: 
“For any two portions of fire, 
small or great, will exhibit the 
same ratio of solid to void; but 
the upward movement of the 
greater is quicker than that of 
the less, just as the downward 
movement of a mass of gold, or 
lead, or of any other body en- 
dowed with weight, is quicker in 
proportion to its size.” This is 
quoted from his book On the 
Heavens. 

Elsewhere (in Physics) he 
stated: “We see that bodies 

which have greater rhope either 
of weight or of lightness, if they 
are alike in other respects, move 
faster over an equal space, and 
in the ratio which their mag- 
nitudes bear to each other.” The 
Greek word rhope unfortunately 
is quite rubbery in its meaning; 
the Latin editions of Aristotle 
use velocitas or celeritas (both 
meaning “speed,” of course) 
where the original uses rhope . 
But in English the words “im- 
pulse,” “momentum,” “trend” or 
even “tendency” might be used 
with nearly equal justification. 



A RISTOTLE, then, did not 
actually speak of “fall, velo- 
city of,” but of movement, and 
Galilei’s rendering which has re- 
placed the original phrasing 
might be considered a “populari- 
zation.” 

However, it was “always” 
taken to apply to the speed of 
falling bodies too. Ioannos Phil- 
oponus, who wrote a commentary 
on Aristotle’s Physics in 533 
A. D., said that the reasoning was 
“absolutely false” and that this 
was one of the cases where the 
phenomenon can better be tested 
by observation than by logic. “If 
you take two masses greatly 
differing in weight and release 
them from the same elevation, 
you will see that the ratio of 
times in their movements does 
not follow the ratio of the 
weights, but [that] the time dif- 
ference is extremely small; so 
that if the weights do not greatly 
differ, but one, say, is double the 
other, the difference in the times 
[required for falling a given 
distance] will be either none at 
all or imperceptible.” 

Now that we know the con- 
cept Galilei was fighting, we 
come to the crucial point. When 
did he drop the cannon ball and 
the musket ball from the leaning 
Campanile and what did he say 
about it himself? 

The answer, surprisingly, is 
that he never said a word about 



THE AIR ON THE MOON 



73 



it. In his writings (and not only 
his published books but many of 
his letter are known)' he never 
even mentions Pisa’s Campanile. 
And while he wrote much later 
that one could easily test his 
ideas by dropping weights from 
a high place, such as a tower, he 
nowhere says that he did it. 

Then who originated the story? 

It can be found for the first 
time in a biography of Galilei by 
Vincenzio Viviani. Viviani com- 
pleted his manuscript in 1654, 
twelve years after Galilei’s death. 
That it was not printed until 
1717 is probably unimportant; it 
was then customary to let manu- 
scripts and handmade copies of 
manuscripts circulate among 
learned men, like Vincenzio 
Viviani himself. 

Viviani described the great 
event in rather dry language. He 
said that Galilei had disproved 
many of the conclusions of 
Aristotle: “among others that the 
velocities of moving bodies of the 
same material, [but] of unequal 
weight, moving through the same 
medium, did not mutually pre- 
serve the proportion of their 
weight as taught by Aristotle, 
but all moved at the same speed; 
demonstrating this with repeated 
experiments from the height of 
the Campanile of Pisa in the 
presence of the other teachers 
and philosophers, and the whole 
assembly of students ...” 



Three things will be noted: 
Viviani does not mention the 
weights of the bodies dropped and 
does not say what they were. He 
also does not give the year — - 
but since Galilei was in Pisa from 
the latter part of 1589 to the 
early part of 1591, as he says 
elsewhere, he probably did not 
think it necessary to be specific. 
But while everybody else at a 
later date spoke about one 
dramatic demonstration, Viviani 
calmly said “repeated experi- 
ments.” 

r T'HE historical problem here is, 
of course, the reconciliation 
between Galilei’s own silence and 
Viviani’s statement. Before I get 
to this, it must be mentioned that 
Galilei’s experiment was not as 
unique as it is usually portrayed. 
Hieronymus Cardanus, in his 
book Opus Novum de Propor- 
tionibus, published in Basel in 
1570, began a chapter with the 
straight statement: Si duae 

sphaerae ex eadem materia de- 
scendant in aere eodem temporis 
momento ad planem ueniunt. 
“Two spheres made of the same 
material, falling in (meaning 
through) air, will arrive at a 
plane at the same instant.” The 
word “plane” is to be understood 
in its mathematical sense; the 
illustration given by Cardanus 
looks as if he had a table top in 
mind. 



74 



GALAXY 



And the Dutchman Simon 
gtevin, in a book published in 
Leyden in 1605, wrote: “The ex- 
periment against Aristotle is like 
this: take two balls of lead (as 
the eminent Jean Grotius . and 
I did some time ago), one ball 
ten times the other in weight; 
and let them go together from a 
height of 30 feet down to a 
plank below . the sound of the 
two in striking will seem to 
come back as one single report.” 

And at some time before 1612 
a defender of Aristotle, Giorgio 
Coresio, did drop things from 
the tower of Pisa. Another man, 
Jacopo Mazzoni, had made such 
experiments finding Aristotle 
wrong. 

Coresio said that this was 
due to the fact that Mazzoni 
did not go high enough; he 
probably just dropped things 
from his window, whereas Cor- 
esio had gone up all the way to 
the top of the tower and at this 
great height had found Aristotle’s 
assertion correct. 

Am I, in quoting all these 
other authors, delaying a deci- 
sion of the main question? No, I 
have quoted these contemporary 
facts because their existence, in 
my opinion, is the clue to the 
historical riddle. 

The riddle is the silence of 
Galilei himself — unless he used 
Viviani as his mouthpiece. This 
is what the editors of the Italian 



edition of Galilei’s works believe, 
namely that Galilei told Viviani 
about the Pisa experiments when 
he was old. There is no doubt 
that they had close personal con- 
tact and it is known that Galilei 
was blind for the last five years 
of his life. He might very well 
have told Viviani things which 
he had never written down. 

He might even have said some- 
thing that wasn’t so. History is 
full of statements ascribed to 
voluble old men which could not 
be checked and which are, to 
say the least, doubtful. There is 
no reason to think that Viviani 
invented the story. Galilei him- 
self might have, but I don’t think 
so. That he did not mention it 
earlier in his writings can have 
several reasons. 

/~"|NE assumption is that he 
'“^did mention it in some early 
letters which were not kept by 
their recipients or were destroyed 
by accident before they saw 
print. 

Another possibility is that, 
being busy all his life and often 
harrassed, he just didn’t. That 
such a thing can happen is 
within my own experience. Some 
time ago I came across a discus- 
sion, bolstered by high-speed 
photographs, showing that if you 
drop a drop of milk in water the 
resulting splash will carry some 
of that milk upward. Whereupon 



THE AIR ON THE MOON 



75 



I told my wife that I, as a 
schoolboy (about seventh grade), 
amused myself by trying to hit 
a floating piece of wood with 
thrown pebbles and discovered 
that the splash from a stone was 
clean, while the splash from a 
clump of earth was decidedly 
dirty. It had at that time intrigued 
me so much that I forgot all 
about the floating wood and even 
called classmates to watch the 
effect. I may have missed a 
“discovery” by waiting for others 
to photograph drops of milk. 

In thinking all this over, one 
point occurred to me which I 
haven’t seen mentioned anywhere 
else. Modern writers have made 
much of the paramount impor- 
tance, the decisiveness, of the 
drop from the Campanile. If it 
had been so decisive, contempo- 
rary literature should be full of 
it. Since contemporary literature 
literally doesn’t say a word, the 
German Emil Wohlwill (in 1909) 
was the first to conclude that the 
whole story probably was not 
true. And Lane Cooper, a quarter 
century later, drew the same 
conclusion for the same reason. 

But what if the experiment, 
though carried out “repeatedly” 
as Viviani says, simply did not 
impress the contemporaries? 

We do have convincing and 
much more recent examples. 

Everybody in the airplane and 
airline business now makes a 



large to-do every December 17th 
about “Kitty Hawk Day.” But 
the actual Kitty Hawk Day, 
when the Wright brothers flew 
for the first time, hardly got into 
the newspapers. All the recogni- 
tion originally received for the 
first flight could be reprinted on 
one page of this magazine. 

Likewise March 16, 1926, is 
the day the first liquid-fuel 
rocket in all history (Goddard’s) 
lifted itself off the ground. His- 
toric day, isn’t it? Again the 
publicity received would fit this 
magazine page — and the editor 
could specify nice large type be- 
cause of the importance of the 
event and the meagerness of the 
recognition. Sometime in 1932 the 
first Russian liquid-fuel rocket 
(Blagonravov’s) rumbled up- 
ward. Certainly a historic date, 
too, but it seems that even the 
Russians do not know the date; 
I have only seen the year men- 
tioned. 

And the first liquid-fuel rockets 
in Germany (mixed system 
Oberth, Riedel, von Braun and 
Ley) received publicity only be- 
cause we made it — we needed 
publicity to raise money. 

It is quite conceivable that 
Galilei rounded up his students 
and some faculty members, made 
the demonstration — and did 
not impress anybody. This would 
be reason enough for his later 
silence. All the more so because 

GALAX! 



jje could not even claim priority, 
since Cardanus had written about 
it in 1570, twenty years prior to 
Galilei’s Pisa tenure, and even 
Simon Stevin’s book appeared 
ahead of Galilei’s own Dialogues. 
If the Pisa experiments did not 
impress anybody, Galilei had no 
reason to talk about them in his 
later works. They had not made 
him famous and they were not 
even new. 

Until he reached old age and 
had stopped being active and 
started reminiscing. 

NOTE ON EARLY 
SCIENCE FICTION 

AN ONE really doubt 
...” intelligent life 
has developed on other planets 
[somewhere in our galaxy] and 
that these intelligences have 
learned how to build interstellar 
ships .... that they have used 
these ships to colonize countless 
other planets .... that they might 
have had to destroy painlessly 
unsuccessful evolutionary devel- 
opments on such other planets to 
replace “painful evolution by 
painless colonization” .... that 
they have left other planets 
undisturbed “as a biological 
reservoir” [or as control ex- 
periments, as we might call 
it] . and that they have 
refrained from communicating 
with us [and possibly other 

THE AIR ON THE MOON 



planets like ours] waiting for us 
to take the first step in inter- 
stellar communication? 

Let me say first that these 
thoughts were written down in 
about 1933, but were probably 
conceived by the man who wrote 
them at a much earlier age, 
since in 1933 he was over 
seventy years old. 

Now stop for a moment; don’t 
read on. Try to figure out who 
said this. 

The answer is: 

Not a science fiction writer, but 
Konstantin Eduardovitch Ziol- 
kovsky, who wrote the first of 
the modern treatises on space 
travel in 1898 and saw it pub- 
lished in 1903. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

I saw an article in a photographic 
magazine proving that the pic- 
tures which the Russians said 
they took of the other side of 
the Moon are fakes. Where does 
that put us in the space race? I 
have also read that the Russians 
claim to have discovered a new 
planet beyond Pluto. Is there any 
truth to this? 

Erwin Richter 

Farmingdale, Long Island. 

As for the first item, I can 
only say that all reputable 
scientists the world over accept 
the pictures released by Russia 
as genuine. Personally I don’t 




76 



77 



have the slightest doubt. That 
somebody crops up with the 
intention of keeping his eyes 
firmly closed is no novelty at 
all. For instance, I recently got 
a phone call from somebody who 
still maintains that the Earth is 
flat. So this “revelation” has ab- 
solutely no bearing on the space 
race; we still are where we were 
before, several years behind, 
with no prospect of narrowing 
the gap during 1960 and little 
chance for doing this in 1961. 

As for the “discovery of a 
major planet beyond Pluto,” I 
can report that this isn’t so — 
the “claim” seems to have been 
a mistake in translation. The 
actual story is that the Russian 
astronomer Edward Denisiuk, at 
the observatory near Alma-Ata, 
photographed an unlisted “ob- 
ject” in August 1957. He did 
not then know what it was; it 
could have been a new comet. 
Near the end of 1959 the 
“object” was found on other 
plates taken in 1957 and a pre- 
liminary orbit calculation could 
be made, proving that it was an 
unlisted asteroid. Just who 
changed this into a “trans-Plu- 
tonian planet” will probably 
never become known. The culprit 
has not owned up yet and it 



seems very unlikely that he 
ever will. 

How many elements are there 
now, including the man-made 
ones? 

Welson S. Mann 
Hollywood, Calif, 

The usual statement is that 
there are 92 elements, from No. 
1, hydrogen, to No. 92, uranium. 
But actually three of these 92 do 
not occur in nature. They are No. 
43, technetium; No. 61, pro- 
methium (formerly called illi- 
nium ) ; and No. 85, astatine. On 
the other hand No. 94, plutonium, 
usually a man-made element, 
does occur in nature, though in 
quantities far far smaller than 
even radium. 

The man-made elements, so 
far, are No. 93, neptunium; No. 
94, plutonium; No. 95, americium; 
No. 96, curium; No. 97, berkel- 
ium; No. 98, californium; No. 99, 
einsteinium; No. 100, fermium; 
No. 101, mendelevium, and No. 
102, nobelium. 

However, the ones above plu- 
tonium have been made in such 
small quantities that they would 
be invisible to the naked eye, in 
some cases invisible even under 
a laboratory microscope.

tor Adelitka Wynn creating a scene 
in the Mars terminal bar. Her so- 
ciology was better than her sense, 
as she accused him of making a pass 
at her. He would have liked to, 
perhaps, but ship’s etiquette said: 
“Crews date, captains wait, space 
is not the place.” He and she had 
been the last alive, and the last 
image he had seen on the screen 
had been a sun. Whose sun, which 
sun, and where were just unin- 
formed speculations. But he was 
alive and conscious of himself. And 
he was buried deep in something. 

He tried to define his feelings. 

The alternating pressure of the 
darkness was felt only in one spot, 
in the area of his heart and about 
the size of a small bean. The oc- 
casional itching came from below 
this. He thrust again and again rose 
upward. Yet he had no heart, or no 
sense of hearing, for he could hear 
no sound of pumping. After several 
years in space he was only too fa- 
miliar with the sound of his own 
blood circulating in his veins. The 
voids of space turned men into 
especially noisy bodily orchestras. 
There was none of that now. 

He thought of himself as having 
the shape of a man, but perhaps 
that was just habit. The only area 
he could in fact feel was the bean 
slightly higher than his middle . 
and a column perhaps attaching 
him to the bean . and this itch- 
ing down below, in what seemed to 
be one doubled-up leg. He thrust 

80 



again and again, rising higher each 
time. There was nothing else to 
do. He never felt tired. He never 
felt anything, except the itching. 

t 1 VENTUALLY he felt a slack- 
ening on the upward pressure. 
He had kicked with his one leg, 
risen and found no resistance. 
Warmth played over him and he 
uncurled his head. So he had a 
head. 

Habit had accustomed him to 
seeing with his eyes, from one set 
focal point. It was some time be- 
fore he found he could see, in a 
general way, from any point on his 
exposed surface. 

He could even see parts of him- 
self, where the edges doubled 
over. It was like being able to run 
round a large gallery on the top 
of a dome, looking out at the view 
— and yet being the entire dome. 
He was green! He looked down 
beneath him and saw a long green 
pillar, tubular and shiny, rising out 
of a brown background. 

He could still feel the beating 
pressure down below. It struck him 
that he was a plant, growing from 
seed which presumably his liqui- 
fied, atomized or dissolved body 
had provided, and emerging on die 
surface of a planet. 

Immediately overhead a bright 
orange satellite swung through a 
brilliant yellow and white sky. Un- 
less there were two suns here, this 
was no more than a satellite body, 

GALAXY 



yapped in orbit, for he could feel 
the fierce beat on his surface from 
another source on the other side of 
the sky. This was a vast fiery globe 
traveling at immense speed. 

He felt a vigorous thrusting in- 
side his structure as he expanded. 
But darknesss rushed up from the 
bottom of the pit in which he stood, 
and cloud came in to mask the sky. 

The general inference was that 
he was on a very warm planet 
around which the bright orange 
satellite swung, and that both were 
circling the hot sun at a speed far 
exceeding that of Mercury. Natu- 
rally that was only a subjective im- 
pression. But the little he had seen 
did not suggest any system he had 
ever heard of. He curled up. 

Each time the sun went past he 
grew further out toward the edge 
of the pit. He branched and clung 
to the earth with subsidiary ten- 
drils. It was exactly as though he 
were clawing with fingers into the 
earth, except that he did not re- 
move them but simply grew on past 
them. When he reached the top of 
the pit, and accustomed his seeing 
to the greater distances now before 
him, he saw a violently active world 
of fire and steam. The ultra-rapid 
rotation of this planet made day 
and night into the flickering of a 
primitive film. Mountains of earth 
were raised up, broke off and shat- 
tered. Remote volcanoes fizzed 
into action briefly like fireworks 
and faded, their tremendous dis- 

THE I M ITATION OF EARTH 



play spent. Whole swamps heaved 
and moved with internal motion. 
He became big enough to be able 
to lose a side creeper without giv- 
ing it a thought. He felt no pain. 

There were advantages in being 
a plant, and particularly in being 
an apparently highly active 
creeper. He could see from any 
point in his enormous network. He 
could organize races between his 
outlying tendrils. He found that 
the orange satellite exerted quite 
a strong pull on his internal sap 
system, which was not unpleasant. 

r I ' HE first sign of life other than 
himself, oddly, came up from 
a neighboring pit. 

It lay within the area he had 
grown over, but he had never 
bothered to send down shoots and 
side creepers into it. It was a pecul- 
iar sensation to recognize — Dr. 
Adelitka Wynn. 

He sent out a sly root and de- 
tected that she was a bulb forma- 
tion. Her indignation was trans- 
mitted violently along the ground, 
in a series of sharp shocks. She 
stood in tall sheaves of broad- 
bladed grass which rustled in the 
wind. He found it was intelligible, 
though of a different timbre than 
the deep, rough scraping he made 
with his own hairy leaves. 

“Kindly keep to yourself,” she 
said in effect. 

Her leaves had a high hissing 
note. He marveled that she had 

81 



managed to retain the same un- 
pleasant approach to life. 

She was objectionable again 
when she had filled her pit and 
found she could not extend onto 
the flat earth beyond, because he 
had already covered the area. 

“Come on,” he said. “We’ve got 
the whole world to ourselves.” 

“I can’t,” she answered hissing- 
ly. “You have spikes on your stems. 
They’ll tear my leaves.” 

He shut off the sap from a whole 
subsidiary system, killing it. She 
spread over his withered shoots and 
leaves without a sound of acknowl- 
edgment. They both developed 
toward the marshes. 

As he approached, leaving her 
slower bulb-formation behind as he 
raced tendril ahead of tendril down 
the slope, he saw there were other 
forms of life, in the water. 

He said nothing. But he quietly 
doubled his thorns and built up a 
reserve in his advance tendrils, so 
that he could rush an armored 
shoot across the ground at high 
speed if necessary. The aquatic life 
moved and died extremely fast. 
Whole species expanded from a 
single specimen, and for no visible 
reason extinguished themselves. 
Life on the planet did not seem to 
be stable. It was highly experi- 
mental. He had been down at the 
marsh for some time before the first 
crablike object came into existence 
and began to leave the water in 
fitful dashes. He gave it an early 



dose of his thorns. Thereafter it 
left him alone. 

The former Dr. Adelitka Wynn, 
however, approached the marsh 
without looking. 

He watched with satisfaction. 
She was a golden brown and ten- 
der green, and highly succulent ap- 
parently to the crab tribe. She cried 
for help. 

They were, after all, the only 
two of human origin on the planet 
So he put his reserve to work and 
sent an armored set of shoots rac- 
ing across the ground as a barrier 
between her and the marsh. The 
crab tribes retreated. 

“Thank you,” she said, regener- 
ating her clipped stems. 

“That’s the first time you’ve ever 
said that,” he said hoarsely. 

“I’m sorry. I am . really glad 
you’re here.” 

“How glad?” 

“This is a most peculiar world,” 
she said, changing the subject. “I 
don’t recognize it at all.” 

He said nothing but sent out an 
advancing barrier of thorns to clear 
a small area of marsh for her. He 
performed small services with his 
roots and tendrils, levering apart 
her bulbs where they were in dan- 
ger of rotting, brushing small in- 
sects off her leaves when they 
became established in colonies. His 
main trunk was now thicker than 
the body of a man, and he covered 
several miles. In the marsh, his 
shoots were thick and black, stand- 



ing like dark fingers deep into the 
ooze. Out in the drier areas, which 
seemed to be spreading, he modi- 
fied his system to conserve internal 
moisture. He grew fine multitudes 
of hairs against the heat and preda- 
tory insects. Dr. Adelitka Wynn 
covered several acres herself, sur- 
rounded by his thorn barriers. 



"W/'HEN she felt well established, 
™ she flowered in great blue 
blossoms, heavy with orange pol- 
len. He had been waiting, and flow- 
ered all along his immense length 
in every color of the spectrum, 
mile upon mile of wide flat flowers, 
open and ready for the breeze. She 
did not protest. He sent clouds of 
pollen from his anthers, turning the 
landscape into a fine mist that 
drifted over her. He covered her 
with several pounds of fine golden 
dust. 



“Thank you,” she said. 

He wondered whether she would 
produce a bulb like her or a young 
creeper like himself. He kept young 
tendrils hanging around her like a 
catcher’s glove, until she told him 
to go away and let her seed in 
peace. 

She seeded in a particularly 
stormy period and in profusion. 
She did it with a gusto and variety 
that amazed him. Seeds with air- 
borne devices, parachutes, airvanes, 
twirling rotators, balls of down, 
with hard shells, soft shells. She 
even kept some pods, and, with a 



THE IMITATION OF EARTH 



gesture almost tender, allowed 
ripe seeds to fall into his waiting 
leaves. He passed these very slowly 
and carefully along his system, 
from cup to cup. He cleared a slope 
near the marsh and brushed deep 
furrows with his thorns to put the 
seeds in. He planted them gently 
and grew an open lattice of thorny 
stems above them, so that only the 
sunlight could get in. As they grew, 
he retreated his protective screen 
to allow them air and free ground 
of their own. They shot up straight 
and tall, saplings headed for the 
stars. 

The other seeds had taken hold 
in remote regions, in marshes, on 
the rising and falling mountains, 
and in great flat stretches of pul- 
verized volcanic dust. He found he 
was aware of them and could, by 
concentrating, even gain a vague 
impression of the ground around 
them, as if each were a locus of his 
consciousness. He also found a tele- 
pathic link now existed between 
him and their mother. It was vague 
at first but it became clearer, even- 
tually superseding speech between 
them. 

None of their children had flow- 
ers. Only the two of them flowered, 
pollinated and seeded with regu- 
larity. Their seeds spread in a 
variety — and variety was the word, 
for in the first seeding she had 
packed as many variations as she 
could imagine. There was, in his 
opinion, too much emphasis on 



82 



GALAXY

grasses after her own general style 
and too few creepers like himself. 
But that was a small detail. The 
original form did not last long in 
any case. Some of his seedlings had 
been enclosed by the rising marshes 
and were now more comfortable 
under water than above. A few 
wilder members even retained a 
measure of mobility and spent their 
lives floating from place to place. 

H E did not entirely approve of 
this. But, as the marshes grew 
under the constant rain and ac- 
quired an unpalatable saltiness so 
that they were virtually seas, he 
saw the sense of this development. 
He now covered, by himself and in 
proxy through his seeds, almost the 
entire land area of the planet. She 
extended just as far. They came to 
a working agreement to leave cer- 
tain areas primarily for the grass- 
like progeny and others for his 
more treelike seedlings. The global 
view led them both to consider the 
same experiment. 

There were occasional worms 
and crablike creatures, minute 
bodies floating with his somewhat 
gipsy water-seedlings, but they and 
their own seeds were the only sig- 
nificant forms of life on their 
planet. 

“Shall we see what we can 
evolve?” he suggested. 

“I had that thought myself,” she 
answered. 

“At least we know the end prod- 



uct. It seems unlikely, now, but 
man must have come from much 
this environment on Earth.” 

“Very well. Where shall we 
start?” 

“I have some enterprising water- 
plants,” he said diffidently. 

“We have.” 

It was an ambitious program. 
But, on the other hand, life on 
Earth had presumably also devel- 
oped against all probabilities. Here 
on their planet they could provide 
continual intelligent guidance. 

They went out into their water- 
plants and sensed through their 
miles of sensory surfaces the most 
favorable areas of the planet. They 
encouraged the water-plants to 
breed, cross-breed and extend. 
They fed fractional parts of them- 
selves to each other, loaded cer- 
tain areas with nutrient life, en- 
couraged mobility. 

Great continental areas rose and 
sank. Generation after generation 
was rapidly produced and as rap- 
idly developed and died. The 
planet was littered with the re- 
mains of unsuccessful experiment. 
But, mainly by concentration on 
iron-rich diets and localizing their 
sight perceptions repeatedly in one 
particular part of their species, they 
produced plants which no longer 
responded to them. They had sepa- 
rate existence of their own. 

At last they managed to lure re- 
peated generations out of the water 
and onto land. 



They had the advantage not of 
merely controlling the environ- 
ment but of being the environment. 
Subject to the violence of vol- 
canoes and the endless shifting of 
the planet’s crust, aberrations in 
the plane of rotation, and rapid 
changes of climate, as ice mounted 
and retreated and heat waxed and 
waned, within these limits they 
could and did make arbitrary deci- 
sions. By withdrawing from an 
area, either of them could create a 
desert. By doubling their rate of 
growth in a local tributary of them- 
selves, they could create a forest. 
Their descendant seeds were as 
much part of themselves as the 
original trunks. In fact, they rarely 
distinguished between that original 
growth and later developments. It 
came as quite a surprise to them 
both to find there was not much 
left of the first bulb clusters and 
the first sprawling creeper. 

/'|NCE they had induced the 
more-or-less fishes to leave 
the water, progress was rapid. 

There was never a difficulty 
quite as great as that again. On 
land, wherever the land happened 
to be at the time, they could induce 
generations of different shapes and 
sizes by modifying the vegetation 
— themselves, in their many forms. 
He took his branches higher and 
higher in a sparse zone, for ex- 
ample, to encourage the necks of 
the local animals to extend. They 



were remodeling their program 
deliberately on their old Earth, cut- 
ting off what they knew to be un- 
successful by-paths and nurturing 
the developments that should lead 
to man. The original crablike in- 
habitants had long since passed 
away, though they had used some 
features of these. The insects con- 
tinued to multiply on their own by 
sheer probability and without then- 
guidance. 

They were both ruthless in then- 
experiments. Once they abolished 
whole races of enormous vegetar- 
ians by withholding themselves in 
inaccessible areas. Like the dino- 
saurs, whom they resembled 
closely, these great reptiles were 
too big and too stupid. 

She blamed him for having al- 
lowed them to feed too many gen- 
erations on too highly radioactive 
parts of themselves. 

“I can’t be everywhere at once 
all the time,” he said. 

To annoy her, and because he 
had been a space captain, he en- 
couraged an entirely abortive series 
of flying reptiles. 

His excuse was true. By exerting 
his consciousness to its maximum, 
he could be aware of almost all the 
planet simultaneously, but this 
awareness lacked intensity and 
definition. 

The comfortable maximum for 
concentration was about a hundred 
square miles. If he focused his at- 
tention within a square mile, his 



84

THE IMITATION OF EARTH

roots and trunks and branches 
hissed with massive life and rapidly 
propagated themselves into a thick 
jungle. This in turn multiplied the 
surface areas and diffused his at- 
tention. There was a lot going on 
in the undergrowth that they both 
missed. 

They almost missed their ulti- 
mate triumph. 

’ 1 1 HE satellite of their planet had 
cooled. The sun around which 
they swung was shielded by thick 
banks of the carbon dioxide they 
breathed off from their myriad 
bodies. They had stabilized most 
of the animals. Despite the re- 
peated cataclysms they had arrived 
at descendants who could flower 
just as they themselves originally 
had flowered. 

As a matter of fact, he was quite 
deeply taken with an offshoot 
wood of flowering trees. In the 
guise of honeysuckle he spent most 
of his time wooing tenderly round 
their trunks, to the fury of her 
grasses and the lashing of her reeds. 

An object that was a rudimen- 
tary improvement on an ape came 
shambling into the wood where he 
was and quite idiotically tore off 
some of his prettier flowers. 

On checking, he found there 
were several varieties of this object 
in various parts of the planet. None 
appeared any better than this brute, 
who whizzed through the trees and 
bred and died in a flicker of time. 



“He’ll never last,” he said to her. 
“His metabolism burns out before 
he has time to do anything.” 

“He’ll reproduce all the faster," 
she answered. “And leave those 
trees alone. At your age, really!” . 

She was right about the proto- 
type brute. Never in their experi- 
ments had they produced a crea- 
ture that was so active. They had 
raised animals that bred much 
faster, but none that bred at a rea- 
sonable pace and also kept flashing 
about the planet in a restless 
motion. 

They had to litter the ground 
with suitable seeds before the 
humanoids stopped long enough in 
one spot to try planting for them- 
selves. And even then, the idea did 
not take root for many many gen- 
erations. But here and there, at 
last, they had the beginnings of a 
culture, and the beginnings of 
speech. The telepathic content of 
the humanoids’ speech was intel- 
ligible to them, though not appar- 
ently intelligible to the humanoids 
themselves. 

They concentrated on the tem- 
perate zones, where they could 
most easily encourage the human- 
oids to stand still from generation 
to generation. The humanoid dwell- 
ings flickered into existence and 
decayed too rapidly for any reli- 
able observations until several 
tribes of them took to using stone 
for building materials. 

“Well,” he said thankfully, “at 

GALAXY 



86 



] as t I can tell where they are with- 
out dashing from branch to branch 
like one of your monkeys.” 

He still did not believe her mon- 
key experiments had had much to 
do with it. Secretly he suspected 
she had encouraged that develop- 
ment to annoy him — by putting 
multitudes in his hair, so to speak. 
It was just and proper, therefore, 
that the humanoids trampled all 
over her grasslands by preference. 

It was in this mood that he cre- 
ated cool groves of tall trees and 
concentrated in them thoughts of 
love and pleasure. 

The humanoids took the hint re- 
markably quickly. He had many 
happy generations encouraging the 
humanoids to sport in his groves. 
She was furious. But trees were his 
province and there was nothing she 
could do about it. 

“You’re debasing them,” she 
complained. 

“They’re enjoying themselves, 
aren’t they?” 

“Voyeur!” 

Well, he frankly enjoyed the 
swift rush of little pink bodies in 
and out of the groves. He was sorry 
when she succeeded in countering 
with a sterner line of thought, bred 
out of her deserts and thin-grassed 
mountains, where she was full of 
thought of privacy, and continence, 
and wonder and the stars. When he 
could, he made life uncomfortable 
for these higher-minded genera- 
tions. He was never slow to create 

THE, IMITATION OF EARTH 



sybaritic and sensual surroundings 
to knock them off their mental 
perches. In one group of islands — 
which she could not reach because 
his pines starved out her seeds be- 
fore they had a chance to establish 
— he had a series of permanent 
statues erected to himself by the 
humanoids, and he had frank and 
open worship. He considered it 
very proper. He maintained a cool 
and bracing temperature in the 
trees around the sandy shores. 

He had passed through four or 
five hundred generations of giant 
redwoods before the little huma- 
noids established themselves in the 
cities across the planet. Many of 
their activities were too fast for 
him to perceive, but he could con- 
template their cities. 

These were temporary struc- 
tures, on the scale of the thrusting 
growth he felt in one of his red- 
woods. Still, to these dizzy little 
humanoids no doubt the cities 
lasted long enough. It was rare 
now for him to pick up a humanoid 
thought. Unlike their first models, 
the present generations thought at 
the high speed which characterized 
their entire life. A blurred flicker 
of an impression to him was ap- 
parently the whole life’s output of 
one of her contemplatives sitting in 
a cave, until he fell to pieces and 
was whizzed away. 

The pink varieties no longer 
worshipped him, save fitfully, but 
he still had a pleasant range of 



87 



warmer-colored humanoids whom 
he could tempt into an orgy. This 
kept him deep in the forests on the 
central belt of the planet. 

CHE signaled to him from across 
^ the main ocean. He transferred 
his consciousness to join her on 
the edge of one of her wide prairies. 

“I think we’ve done very well,” 
she said. 

“Surely you didn’t call me all the 
way here just to say that.” 

“Yes. It really is Earthlike, isn’t 
it? I felt it was about time you 
congratulated me.” 

He thought back. 

“I don’t remember, now,” he said. 
“But it seems to be roughly similar.” 
“Roughly! After all this time, 
you dare to suggest I have only 
achieved a rough similarity? I was 
a trained sociologist, kindly remem- 
ber. It is exactly like Earth.” 

He looked patiently up at the 
satellite and the stars. She was 
detailing the achievement interm- 
inably. 

"It’s very difficult to tell,” he 



said, interrupting her. “Our time 
scale is quite different from what 
it was on Earth. These humanoids 
of ours breed and die like ephem. 
erids.” 

She rustled impatiently. 

“If you took trouble to examine 
the species from their time scale, 
you would find it is precisely the 
same as Earth time to them.” 

“Is it? Very well, I believe you. 
We have created an exact duplicate 
of the other Earth. Congratula- 
tions.” 

“You’re just agreeing without 
proof. I have evidence to show the 
sociology is a detailed replica. 
These humanoids are repeating 
human history exactly as we knew 
it! One of our ivy shoots even re- 
ported a tombstone marked ‘Killed 
in the Battle of Bunker Hill, June 
17 , 1775 .’” 

“Now you’re exaggerating!” he 
said. “How could they possibly 
duplicate a time system that ap- 
plied on the other Earth?” 

“What other Earth?” she said.

There was no answer. 

George wrapped a towel around

“Do me a favor, Rosy,” George 



said. “Put caps on bottles so your

Rosy looked up at him, stretcb-

“I told you, die catch wouldn’t 
catch.” 

“The catch would catch all right 
if you didn’t leave Timmy’s diaper 
hanging out.” 

“That’s not fair,” Rosy said. 
“Blaming little Timmy.” 

His hands tried to crush an in- 
visible bowling ball. “Just a little 
. presence of mind, Rosy. Okay?” 
“You dropped your towel,” Rosy 
said, looking away. 

George ran into the bedroom 
and came back in his pajamas. ‘Tor 
God’s sake, honey, try to remem- 
ber what you’re doing when you’re 
doing it. Like with the power 
mower.” 

“I suppose that was my fault?” 
“Don’t you know enough to cut 
the engine when you’re done?” 

“I wasn’t done. I had to answer 
the phone, didn’t I?” 

George threw up his hands. “So 
all right. So you left it running and 
it went right through Charlie’s 
fence.” 

“Sometimes,” Rosy said, putting 
down the magazine, “you exasper- 
ate me, George. I told you, I put 
it in neutral or whatever it is.” 
“You put it in high and let it run 
through Charlie’s fence.” 

Rosy looked at him as at a bad 
tomato. “Why,” she said, “do I get 
blamed every time something me- 
chanical goes wrong?” 

But they kissed and made up 
because it was the night before 
their third wedding anniversary. 



A T the breakfast table next 
morning George gave her the 
diamond cocktail ring she’d 
drooled over. Rosy gave him the 
self-winding time piece he’d slob- 
bered over in Cellini’s window. 
Dear girl, had the courage to get 
it for nothing down and thirty-six 
months to pay. 

‘Don’t gulp your food,” Rosy 
said. “It’s Charlie’s turn to drive 
you.” 

In his high chair, Timmy scooped 
up handfuls of oatmeal and heaved 
them over the port side. 

When Charlie came to the door 
he had a gift-wrapped box for 
them. It looked heavy. He gave it 
to Rosy and slipped on one of 
Timmy’s oatmeal bombs and flew 
headlong into the couch. 

“Happy wedding anniversary, 
you two,” Charlie said, picking 
himself up. ‘When are you going 
to fix my fence?” 

Rosy weighed the box in her 
arms. “Charlie, that’s real sweet of 
you and Beth. Let’s open it now, 
George.” 

‘We’re late,” Charlie said. He 
wiped his shoe on the rug. “Come 
on, pal.” 

They took the freeway out of 
Sunnydale. Downtown the clock 
on the Trojan Life & Casualty 
building gave them four minutes 
to get there. 

“What was in that box you 
brought?” George asked. 

“A pressure cooker.” 



90 



GALAXY 



“Oh, no.” 

“Supposed to build up terrific 
pressure,” Charlie said. “Five thou- 
sand pounds per square inch.” 

George stared before him as 
they drove into the Park-O-Port 

He had not a moment free till 
his coffee break at ten. Mr. Per- 
kins wanted the Lawndale policies 
cleared right away and Mr. Zung- 
enspiel had all the juniors in for a 
briefing on exorbitant rates. When 
he got back to his desk Maude 
Doody waited to interview him 
about his wedding anniversary for 
her “Sweetness and Light” column 
in Keep Smiling, the company 
weekly. 

“I hope you’re always polite 
to Rosy,” Meddlin’ Maude said. “I 
can’t stand rude men. How old is 
Timmy now?” 

“He’ll be three in September.” 

Maude made a quick mental 
calculation. She looked doubtful. 
“And could you tell us what you 
gave Rosy for her wedding anni- 
versary?” 

“A pressure cooker,” George 
said, forgetting everything else. 

“Is that all? What kind of pres- 
sure cooker, George?” 

“Five thousand pounds per 
square inch.” 

“I mean the brand” Maude said, 
stabbing the air with her sharp 
pencil. ‘Don't you think the folks 
would like to know the brand?” 

“Uh, I guess the best." 

“They’re all best,” Maude said. 

CRY SNOOKER 



“Can’t you remember the brand?” 
“No,” he said. 

Meddlin’ Maude rose to her 
feet. She looked down at him se- 
verely. “George, you’re slipping,” 
she said and marched off to the 
Keep Smiling office. 

G EORGE grabbed the tele- 
phone. Five thousand pounds 
per square inch, he thought. Wham- 
mo! 

The phone rang seven times. 
Then he dialed Charlie’s house, 
but Beth did not answer either. 
Rosy and Beth spent hours at the 
supermart. ‘It was the social cen- 
ter of Sunnydale where the gals 
could gossip a little and compare 
brands. 

George took the elevator up to 
the company cafeteria. On the fifth 
floor Mr. Perkins stepped in. 

“Just got your Lawndale polic- 
ies,” Mr. Perkins said. “Fast work, 
son. Keep it up.” 

“Thank you, sir. I had an in- 
quiry this morning, sir. About do- 
mestic accidents.” 

“Shoot the problem, son.” 

‘Does it cover injury by pres- 
sure cooker?” 

‘Was it Full Coverage or Com- 
plete Coverage?” 

“Complete, sir.” 

“Covers everything from elec- 
trocution in the bath tub to getting 
hit by a stray rocket from Cape 
Canaveral.” 

The elevator let them out at the 

91 



cafeteria. “Mr. Perkins, I’d like to 
double my wife’s policy.” 

“Mighty sensible of you, George. 
Can you afford it?” 

“No, sir.” 

“That’s the spirit! How about 
your own policy, George? Isn’t it 
about time you went up a notch?” 
“You mean it, sir?” 

“I’ve been keeping my eye on 
you,” Mr. Perkins said. “I’ll see 
what I can do.” 

George thanked him profusely. 
“Not at all, not at all,” Mr. 
Perkins boomed. “That’s what old 
dad Perkins is here for.” 

George got his coffee and joined 
Charlie at their corner table. 

“Getting chummy with old dad 
Perkins?” Charlie asked. 

“I just got told,” George said, 
leaning forward, “I could increase 
my insurance.” 

“No!” 

“Said it was time I moved up a 
notch.” 

Charlie clenched his fist. “We 
can make the Country Club, I tell 
you. I’m almost twelve thousand 
in the red, not counting the house 
and the boat. Lefs celebrate, 
Georgie. All four of us. We can go 
to the Emperor Room for sixty 
bucks. That is, if you’re still talk- 
ing to your humble friends.” 
“Come off it.” 

“I’ve seen it happen,” Charlie 
said bitterly. “People getting so 
deep in debt they start snubbing 
their more solvent friends.” 



When Arlene dropped the noon 
mail on George’s desk he sat 
dreaming. More insurance, more 
credit; more credit, more debt; 
more debts, more prestige. He sat 
up with a start and dialed Rosy. 

f T' HIS time she answered and all 
was fine. She’d spent the morn- 
ing in the supermart filling out con- 
test entry blanks and buying a big 
roast for the pressure cooker. 

“Oh, George, it’s a wonderful 
pressure cooker. It looks like a 
space ship, with bolts and portholes 
and all.” 

“I don’t want you to—” 

“And it’s got a remote control i 
panel or something, with all kinds 
of buttons and blinkers, Timmy 
just loves it!” 

“Is Timmy anywhere near it?” 
“He’s in it. It’s a big one.” 
Arlene came by his desk 
“Where’s Charlie?” she asked. “I 
got a telegram for him.” 

George waved her away and 
brought the receiver close to his 
mouth. 

“Rosy, listen,” George hissed. 
“Put that damn thing away till I 
get home. We’re going to the 
Emperor Room with Beth and 
Charlie.” 

There was a short silence. “You 
said you wanted a home-cooked 
meal,” Rosy said. “To remind you 
how married you are.” 

George looked up at Maude 
Doody standing at his desk. “That

sounds like a personal call,” Med- 
dlin’ Maude said. 

“It’s my wife.” 

“You’ve been on that phone 
three minutes,” Meddlin’ Maude 
said, glancing at her watch. “You 
know company policy on personal 
calls, George.” 

“I’m a homemaker,” Rosy was 
saying. “I want to make dinner for 
you and Timmy.” 

“Oh, go to hell!” George said. 
Meddlin’ Maude clutched at her 
heart. 

Rosy gasped. 

Five minutes later: 

“Of course I love you, baby 
doll,” George said weakly. In a 
semi-circle around him stood 
Meddlin’ Maude, Mr. Zungenspiel, 
Mr. Perkins, Arlene, and an as- 
sortment of lesser office authori- 
ties. “Just don’t touch that pres- 
sure cooker till I get home, dam- 
mit. It’s dangerous.” 

“I can only do my best, George,” 
Rosy said with hard finality. “If 
that’s not good enough for you, 
darling” — she choked on a sob — 
“well, I’m sorry.” 

The phone clicked and the wire 
went dead. 

A dozen faces bent over him. 

“George,” Meddlin’ Maude 
said, raising her sharp pencil. 

“Just a minute, Miss Doody,” 
said Mr. Zungenspiel. “Young 
man, would you step into my office 
when you have a tree moment?” 



“If you see Charlie before they 
fire you,” Arlene said, “tell him I 
left a telegram on his desk.” 

“George,” Miss Doody shrilled, 
her sharp pencil raised, “did you 
or did you not tell me to go to 
hell?” 

Charlie crashed through the 
crowd, waving a telegram. “Look 
at this, George!” 

George read the telegram :

“What are you waiting for, 
man?” Charlie said. “Call Rosy, 
will ya?” 

“She won’t answer,” George 
said. “She thinks I don’t love her.” 

“Come on! We better get home 
before she starts making dinner.” 

They ran down to the Park-O- 
Port. 

“Ahm sorry, Mistuh Charlie,” 
the snappy attendant said. “Caint 
git yuh cah now. It’s on de top floh 
behind seven lines of cahs an dey 
aint comin out till five like every 
weekday sept Satterdays, Sunneys 
an holidays.” 

“Give him a tip and let’s get a 
taxi,” George said. He ran into the 
street just in time to flag a cab. 

George tossed the cabbie ten 
dollars. “Step on it. It may be a 
matter of life and death.” 

“I could have called Beth,” 
Charlie said. 

“We’ll get there almost as fast.” 

They zoomed through the under- 
pass and turned onto the freeway. 
A cycle cop emerged from behind 
a Schlitz billboard and took after 
them, his siren wailing. 

“Never mind the cop,” George 
said. 

The cabbie hunched forward 
and gripped the wheel. “Mister,” 
he said, “I’ve been waiting for a 
chance like this.” 

HPHE cop gained on them and 
as he came abreast George 
grew confused. He saw the cop’s 



big sun glasses shining like the eyes 
of a wasp and his hat snapping in 
the wind. George had never broken 
the law in his life. He had a deep 
respect for the police, preservers 
of law and order. 

The cop motioned the cabbie to 
pull over. The cab zoomed over a 
crest on the freeway and ripped 
down the slope with marked in- 
crease in speed. 

George rolled down the window 
and flapped his arms. “My wife!” 
he yelled. 

The cop cut the siren. His hand 
went down to his holster. 

“My wife!” George yelled. 
“Pressure cooker.” 

The cop grinned and nodded to 
say he understood, and roaring 
ahead waved them to follow. The 
siren started up again. 

They lost him when they turned 
off the freeway and raced past the 
supermarket to their street. Sun- 
nydale looked peaceful in the af- 
ternoon. George’s house came in 
view. He heaved a sigh of relief as 
the cabbie pulled to a stop. 

“Rosy!” he yelled, dashing up 
the walk. 

He flung open the door and 
stopped. The house was silent ex- 
cept for Rosy’s voice in the kitchen. 
She was counting backwards: 

“Five . four . three . .” 

“Rosy!” 

“One . zero.” 

A steaming hiss sounded in the 
kitchen. In a moment it rose to a 



CRY SNOOKER 



95 



howling pitch. There was a tre- 
mendous crash and a tremor shook 
the plaster from the walls. 

In the settling dust Timmy 
crawled out of the kitchen with a 
pot on his head. 

In the kitchen Rosy sat on the 
floor, clutching the instruction 
booklet. 

“Now see what you did, 
George!” 

“What /did?” 

“Barging in like that,” Rosy said, 
tears of frustration streaking her 
dusty cheeks. “I must have 
pressed the wrong button.” 

Beside her on the floor lay the 
Touch Command Control Panel. 
Its colored lights blinked on and 
off like a pinball machine. 

Charlie came into the kitchen 
with Timmy in his arms. 

“Oh my gosh!” Rosy cried, look- 
ing up at the ceiling. A hole was 
ripped out in the roof and through 
it they could see God’s blue sky. 

G EORGE grabbed the control 
panel and they ran outside. 
They saw the snooker describing 
a lovely ellipse over Sunnydale. 
“My roast!” Rosy wailed. 

“It seems to be waiting for or- 
ders,” Charlie said. 

“Have to get it down,” George 
said, setting the control panel on 
the lawn. “Before it slams into 
some airplane.” 

He pressed a large red button. 
The snooker wobbled for a mo- 



ment, then broke its orbit and dove 
for Charlie’s house. It smashed in 
at the back and came out the front. 
Beth ran out in a bathrobe, scream- 
ing. 

“Stop it!” Charlie yelled, fling- 
ing himself at the control panel 
and pressing a yellow button. 

The snooker resumed its orbit, 
then wobbled and dove into every 
second or third house in the street, 
working the houses from side to 
side. 

Women ran out and stood dazed, 
clutching their children and watch- 
ing the snooker. 

Desperately George pressed the 
blue button. The snooker resumed 
its orbit, wobbled, flew once over 
the street as if to check what all 
needed to be hit, then slammed 
through the whole length of houses 
from end to end. 

Two houses caught fire. Charlie 
pressed the largest button of all, 
the green one. The snooker righted 
itself and flew out over the town. 
Wherever it struck a small cloud 
of dust rose in the air. 

Four fire-engines turned into the 
street. Three of them turned 
around and raced back to down- 
town. 

They lost sight of the snooker 
for a while. All they saw was the 
clouds of dust mushrooming all 
over town, and here and there a 
fire. When the snooker came in 
view again, it was rising toward a 
jet plane circling overhead. 

GALAXY 



“It’ll get hit!” Charlie said. 
George pressed all four buttons. 
The snooker wobbled for a mo- 
ment. Then it seemed to shake off 
file confused commands and rose 
into the plane’s path. The plane 
veered. The snooker turned after 
it and rose steeply. Then it dove 
and slammed down through the 
fuselage. 

They all stared as the plane 
crashed into the supermarket. 
Above them the pilot floated down 
in a parachute. He seemed to see 
the blinking lights of the control 
panel and worked the chute 
calmly. He landed through the 
hole in Rosy’s kitchen. He came 
out of the house eating a piece of 
cold chicken. 

He wore an air-research uniform 
with a belt slanted across his chest 
and high shiny boots, and in his 
hand he carried a Rommel whip. 

H E strode up to George and 
looked down at the blinking 
control panel. With the toe of his 
boot he pushed a black button in 
the lower left corner and squinted 
up at the sky, chewing the chicken. 
The snooker obeyed instantly and 
resumed its original elliptical orbit. 

“Ja,” he said. “Very goot.” He 
gazed out over the town, the 
clouds of dust and the fires burning. 
“Excellent,” he said, tossing the 
chicken bone over his back. It hit 
Charlie in the face. 

“You must be the dismantling 

CRY SNOOKER 



expert,” George said hopefully. 

“I am more. I am the infentor of 
pressure snooker.” He noticed 
Rosy and Beth. “Ladies,” he said, 
clicking his heels and bowing. "I 
haf the honor to present myself. 
Vernher von Wissenschaft, at your 
serfice.” 

“Lkiewise,” Rosy said. “Could 
you get my pressure cooker down 
before it does any more damage?” 
“Ha ha!” Vernher von Wissen- 
schaft laughed. “Very goot! Pres- 
sure cooker! Hm, goot way to de- 
ceive brutal enemy. Export five 
hoondred tausend pressure cookers 
to enemy homes. Ja, I like it.” 
“You don’t understand,” Rosy 
said. “My roast will be ruined if 
you don’t get it down pretty soon.” 
“You cook rosht in my inten- 
tion?” 

“Biggest roast you ever saw,” 
Rosy said. She hugged George. 
“You see, this is our wedding anni- 
versary and I’m dying to know 
how it came out.” 

“Rosht?” he mused, following 
the snooker with his eyes and lick- 
ing his fingers thoughtfully. “Why 
not? Maybe I make deal on side 
with Amerikan Kitchen Appliance 
Inkorporated. If rosht comes out 
goot.” He looked at the broken 
houses and the firemen spraying 
the fires. “Ja,” he decided, “kill two 
experiments mit one snooker.” 

He waited for the snooker to 
pass overhead. Then he gave the 
control panel a sharp kick with his 



96 



97 



heel, breaking it in two. The 
snooker wobbled and exploded. 
Bits of steel whirred out over Sun- 
nydale. A brown cloud appeared 
above them and in a moment they 
were all drenched in a rainfall of 
roast beef. 

By the time the gravy hit them 
it had cooled enough to taste. 

“It’s wonderful!” Rosy said. 

“Chust a minute,” Vernher von 
Wissenschaft said. “Scientific ex- 
periment not so fast.” He removed 
a shred of roast beef from behind 
his ear and chewed. 

“Isn’t it good?” Rosy asked an- 
xiously. 

Vernher von Wissenschaft fin- 
ished tasting. He thought a mo- 
ment, stretched his face. “Excel- 
lent,” he said. 

“Do you really like it?” 

“Ja, excellent.” He held up a 
finger. “Perhaps,” he suggested, 
“two more grains pepper.” 

r T'WO weeks later, when all the 
fires in the town had been put 
out and the damage assessed, a great 
banquet was held in the Emperor 
Room to honor George. In the 
street a huge crowd of well-wishers 
waited to greet him as he came out. 
The Emperor Room could accom- 
modate only the town’s important 
personages; there were so many of 
them that some of the best families 
did not bribe the mayor in time to 
get a seat. 

But George managed to get 



standing room for Mr. Perkins and 
Mr. Zungenspiel. 

Beside George at the table of 
honor sat Charlie. Next to hinm 
Vernher von Wissenschaft in a 
splendid uniform, cracking his . 
Rommel whip from time to time. 
Everybody who was anybody was 
there: the Police Commissioner, 
the Gambling Czar, the District 
Attorney, the Teamsters’ Boss, 
Senator Smiley, Coroner Schaden- 
frohm, the Election Commissioner, 
the Slum Owner, the Housing In- 
spector. 

“Never before,” the mayor ; 
orated, “has so much damage been 
done by such a little man in such a 
short time.” 

Vernher cracked his whip. “Very , 
goot,” he said, turning to George. 
“Rhetoric, you know.” 

“The national economy,” the 
mayor continued, “was in danger 
of imminent collapse ever since 
our old-fashioned P.O. — planned 
obsolescence — reached a point of 
no return. We had to produce more 
and more until the market was 
glutted. Of course we would not 
sell so much as a toaster to our 
brutal enemy.” (Applause.) 

Vernher cracked his whip. “Very 
goot.” 

“But now,” the mayor said, smil- 
ing at George, “the solution to our 
economic impasse has been found! 
This young man had the daring 
vision to contribute a brilliant new 
concept to our economics. S. D. — ^ 

GALAXY | 



Senseless Destruction!” (Ap- 
plause.) 

Vernher cracked his whip. “Ex- 
cellent.” 

The mayor raised his arms for 
silence. “I have good news,” he 
said. “Congress has just voted one 
billion dollars for Senseless De- 
struction research!” (Wild ap- 
plause.) 

Vernher cracked his whip six 
times. 

“I can promise you, ladies and 
gentlemen,” the mayor continued, 
“what happened to our town is only 
the beginning. As a result of the 
visionary experiment by this daring 
young man, fifty thousand idle con- 
struction workers have already 
been put back on the job; twenty 
new banks have sprung up to han- 
dle the flood of mortgages; a new 
steel mill will be erected in our 
world-famous game preserve. But 
I need not go on. The industries, 
businesses and stock markets that 
will profit by Senseless Destruc- 
tion can hardly be numbered. The 
biggest boom in history is on! And 
as long as we have the snooker it 
will never end!” (General pande- 
monium.) 

When order was restored, the 
mayor turned solemnly to George 
and said: “In grateful recognition 
of your . .” 

After the recognition speech 
George accepted humbly the fol- 
lowing sums, not listing gifts un- 
der $10,000: 

CRY SNOOKER 



$10,000 from Home Builders 
Assn. 

$ 12,500 from Construction 
Union, Local 256. 

$15,000 from Last Bank of 
America. 

$11,276.88 from Unified Steel 
Corp. 

$20,00 from Chicago Furniture 
Mart. 

$ 10,000 from Congress in Series 
E Bonds. 

George also received the follow- 
ing appointments: 

Special Adviser to Mayor on 
Senseless Destruction, with nom- 
inal yearly income of $75,000 tax 
free. 

Vice-President of Trojan Life & 
Casualty Co. 

Chairman of the Board of Trus- 
tees, Sunnydale Game and Wood 
Preserve. 

Honorary Supreme Commander 
of Juvenile Senseless Destruction- 
ists, to be organized. 

A YEAR later George sat wear- 
ily in the control room of his 
chateau on Indian Rock overlook- 
ing the town. Snookers buzzed over 
rooftops like flies. Clouds of dust 
rose prosperously everywhere. In 
the streets construction gangs 
raced in speed trucks. 

George had begun to wonder 
how it would all end. 

After the novelty had worn off, 
Senseless Destruction became 
more monotonous, more depress-

ing than the Installment Way of 
Life before it. People worked 
harder than ever now and had less 
to show for it. Of course, it was 
unpatriotic to have anything to 
show for it. Nobody in his right 
senses would argue against Round- 
the-Clock Employment for All. 
And if you didn’t go around grin- 
ning and saying how happy you 
were with your seventh mortgage, 
people began to suspect you. 

George had talked it all over 
with Rosy and she agreed. Sure, it 
was all right for them — for the 
time being. But George had begun 
to despise himself. 

He had to keep sharp control 
over the snookers. Some of them 
showed a tendency to sneak off 
course, looking for some nice fresh 
target — like the chateau, maybe. 

The butler came in and pre- 
sented a calling card on a silver 
platter. 

“Vernher! Show him in at once.” 
Vernher von Wissenschaft 
marched in, cracking his Rommel 
whip. He looked worried. 

“Bad news,” Vernher said, shak- 
ing hands. “Chust come from the 
President.” 

“How is Charlie?” 

“Goot. But too much work. And 
trouble. These snookers.” Vernher 
strode to the window and looked 
out over the town. 

“They’re doing a fine job,” 
George assured him. 

Vernher turned. A grim smile 



slashed his face. “Too goot. Russian 
economy caught up with ours. 
They vant snookers too. Must 
have snookers or they go kaput.” 
“What’s so bad about that? Let 
them go kaput. Cold war will be 
over at least.” 

Vernher shook his head. “They 
threaten atomic war if they don’t 
get snookers. This time for real.” 

EORGE gave a low whistle. 
“Ja,” Vernher sighed. “Char- 
lie had secret cabinet meeting. We 
cannot take chance. You must go 
teach them how.” 

“Can’t you go?” 

“I’m leaving for Johannesburg 
tonight. United Africa also caught 
up.” 

“As it is our economy barely 
keeps ahead of the Russians!” 

“Ja. But cannot be helped.” 
“Maybe,” George said, “if you 
invented something bigger, better, 
more efficient.” 

“You think I haf not tried?” 
George stood thinking a long 
moment. He said, “Vernher, is 
there no way out?” 

“Sure,” Vernher laughed. “If 
we go back to savage pre-civiliza- 
tion.” 

“All right,” George said. “I’ll go 
tell Rosy. Watch the control panel 
a moment, will you? Especially the 
Eastern Section.” 

“What’s the matter with them?” 
“They seem to be getting rest- 
less lately.” 

GALAXY 



“Nonsense! My snookers haf no 
emotions.” 

“Just seems that way some- 
times,” George said, going out. 
Their job could even make stones 
feel something, he thought. 

He ran down to Rosy in the 
kitchen. She had consented to hav- 
ing servants only because of her 
social position, but she still in- 
sisted on personally running the 
kitchen her own way. 

George pulled her into the hall- 
way and put his arms around her 
and kissed her. 

“What on earth?” she said. 

“You must be very brave, dar- 
ling.” He fixed her with his eyes. 
“Rosy, this is it.” 

«It?” 

“E-Day.” 

E for Escape. 

“We can’t talk now,” he said. 
“Vernher is at the controls.” 

“Can I change?” 

“No time. Are the suitcases 
packed?” 

“They’re in the garage, behind 
the beer barrels.” 

“Go get Timmy,” George said. 
“I’ll drive the station wagon round 
to the back door.” 

At the gate to the grounds they 
stopped and took a last look at the 
chateau. They could see Vernher 
standing in the control window. He 
seemed to be enjoying the spec- 
tacle in the town below. 

Rosy gripped George’s arm. 
“Look!” 

CRY SNOOKER 




A snooker had strayed off its 
orbit and was hissing in toward the 
chateau. It came fast over the 
grounds, heading straight for the 
control window. 

Vernher never saw it coming. 
Probably he did not even hear the 
glass crashing as the sharp slivers 
shot into the room. 

D Y the end of May George was 
still chopping a small clearing 
in the Montana woods. George and 
Charlie’s old campsite. It was 
harder work than he’d expected. 
But it was a good site and the tent 
would be replaced by a heavy log 
cabin before winter set in. Some- 
times they’d climb one of the peaks 
on the Flathead Range and sit gaz- 
ing at Hungry Horse Reservoir in 
the distance. 

The trees were stubborn here, 
blunting the ax. But they’d make it 
all right. George sat down to rest. 

Rosy waved to him from the 
potato patch. A strand of smoke 
rose peacefully from the stone 
oven. He waved back and grinned. 

Timmy worked his way up 
bravely to where George sat. He’d 
gotten used to his bark shoes and 
had quite forgotten that he had 
ever worn any other kind. 

“Can I help you, Daddy?” 

Education too, George thought. 
The real kind. “No, thanks, son,” 
he said. “You’d better help your 
mother plant the potatoes.” 

That evening at supper, as they 



100

sat enjoying sundown and the quiet 
of woods and mountains, they 
heard a motor far away. The wind 
took it away and then it sounded 
much nearer, grinding in low gear. 
George stood up as a jeep came 
round the mountain. In it sat a 
man and a woman. 

The jeep came into the clearing, 
swaying over stones and roots. 

“Charlie!” 

“Hi,” Charlie said. He helped 
Beth down. 

George yanked Timmy to his 
feet. “Stand up, son. This is the

President of the United States.” 

“I got a present for you, George,” 
Charlie said. 

“Not another pressure cooker!” 

Rosy said. 

“A peace pipe,” Charlie said. 
Timmy’s big round eyes took 
him in. “Are you the President?” 
he asked in a small, awed voice. 
“Not any more,” Charlie said. 
George stared at him. “You 
didn’t give up the White House?” 
“What else could I do?” Charlie 
said. “I gave it back to the Indians.”

T HE Double-A call light 
wailed and blinked itself 
into a bright red hemor- 
rhage on the wall. I woke up fast. 
My first thought was fire. Logical- 
ly, reasonably, I know there hasn’t 
been a hotel fire in 800 years — 
but tradition is tradition. 

I punched the visor and Greel’s 
face popped on the screen. The 
lobby clock over his shoulder read 
3 : 35. 1 moaned silently and flipped 
on vocal. 

“Duncan here.” 

“Chief, get down here quick.” I 
didn’t ask why. Greel’s my head 
bellhop and bellhops can smell 
hotel trouble. 

“Where are you?” 

“Level 12. Desk 19.” 

- “Check. Hold everything, kid.” 
I started to cut off, then I saw 
something else behind him. I took 
a deep breath and held it. 

“Greel. Is that - Ollie?” Greel 
nodded. Like he was going to be 
sick. I was in my clothes and out 
the door. I took a manual emergen- 
cy lift and fell seventy-eight floors 
in eighty seconds, not even think- 
ing about my stomach. Not with 
Ollie to think about. 

Ollie’s uncle is Mike Sorrenson, 
owner of Hotel Intergalactica, and 
a reasonably decent person. Ollie is 
something else again. Crewcut, 
eager, bowtie and fresh out of col- 
lege. My job — teach him “all there 
is to know about the hotel busi- 
ness.” Which should be a real snap, 



105 




as he already knows all there is to 
know about everything. 

Thursday, for instance. Ollie got 
his menus mixed and served scram- 
bled eggs to five hundred visiting 
Vegans. That’s all. No trouble. Ex- 
cept the difference between a 
Vegan and a chicken is strictly a 
matter of size and evolution — and 
we’re still cleaning up Ballroom 
Nine. 

T CAME out of the lift, my 
stomach only ten floors behind. 
Ollie popped out of his chair and 
came toward me, a sick smile 
pasted across his face. 

“Mr. Duncan, I—” 

“Sit down, Ollie, and shut up,” I 
said quietly. He swallowed and sat 
down. 

I turned to Greel. 

“Okay,” I said. “I’m ready. Let’s 
have it.” 

“I’ll save the details for later,” 
said Greel. “We’ve got to get mov- 
ing. Fast. I have reason to believe 
there are from four to fifty Skeidzti 
loose in the hotel.” 

I drew a blank at first. Then it 
hit me and I felt cold all over. 

“Oh, my God,” I said, sending a 
withering look at Ollie. 

“Uh-huh.” Greel nodded. “The 
way I get it from Ollie, four Sten- 
torii checked in about 3:00. They 
wanted to go right up tb their room 
so Ollie sent a boy with them and 
told the Stentorii he’d put their 
luggage in a lift right away.” 



“They kind of grinned at me, Mr. 
Duncan,” Ollie interrupted, “and 
said that was fine, there was no hur- 
ry about the bags.” 

“Yeah, I’ll bet they did,” I said. 

I looked at Greel, and we both felt 
sick. “Don’t tell me the rest. Ollie 
checked them in on the Master 
Register, turned to get their bags — 
and what-do-you-know, they were 
gone.” 

Ollie looked surprised. He 
started to ask how I could pos- 
sibly know but I glared him back 
to his chair. 

“Okay,” I said. “What have you 
done so far?” Greel took a deep 
breath. 

“First, they have about thirty to 
thirty-five minutes head start. I’ve 
shielded four levels above and be- 
low. I don’t think they’ll get that 
far, but no use taking chances. 
We’ve got one lucky break. Since 
the whole Quadrant borders on 
Free City they can’t get out except 
through a Registration area.” 

“What about—” 

Greel nodded. “Already done it. 
I’ve closed all five Desks in the 
Quadrant. Anyone wants to regis- 
ter has to come in by way of 
Seven.” 

“Fine. Just one thing—” I flipped 
through the register. “Could they 
have gotten outside through this 
door?” 

“No. It was unshielded, all right 
But there were no checkouts after 
the Stentorii registered.” 

GALAXY 



O UR luck was holding. At least 
the Skeidzti were still just the 
hotel’s problem. I’ve got a few 
friends on Free City’s revolving 
council, but I don’t like to mess 
with those boys unless I have to. 

I sent Greel to organize the bell- 
boys into search squads. Then I 
checked the Stentorii’s room num- 
ber and hauled Ollie out of his 
chair, figuring the only way to make 
sure he stayed out of trouble was 
to keep him with me. Before I left 
the lobby I picked up a pair of low- 
charge stunners and handed one to 
Ollie. 

‘Took,” I said, “do you think 
you could possibly handle one of 
these things without knocking us 
both out cold?” 

Ollie nodded vaguely. He took 
the weapon and held it as if he 
were certain it would go off in his 
hand. 

“Sure, Mr. Duncan, but why do 
we need weapons? I mean. I’m sor- 
ry I let those things get loose, but—" 
I stopped at the lift and stared 
at him. I suddenly realized the poor 
kid had no idea what he had done 
wrong. All he could see was that 
Greel and I were making a big fuss 
over a couple of alien housepets. 

“Ollie,” I said patiently, “do you 
really know what a Skeidzti is? I 
don’t want an oration. Just tell me 
the simple truth. Do you or don’t 
you?” He started to say something, 
then changed his mind and shook 
his head. 

THE STENTORII LUGGAGE 



“I thought so. Well, first of all, 
don’t refer to them as ‘pets.’ They 
may be cute as a kitten to a Sten- 
torii, but as far as you’re concerned 
they are dangerous, quick, carniv- 
orous, highly adaptable little mon- 
sters. Only ‘adaptable’ is about as 
descriptive as calling the ocean 
moist. A Skeidzti in a kitchen will 
hide in a stack of plates and, by 
God, you’ll eat off of him and swear 
he is a plate. A Skeidzti in a gar- 
den is a rock, a weed, a pile of 
leaves. In your bedroom he’s a gar- 
ter, a sock or a necktie. Only — 
put one around your neck and 
you’ll damn well know he’s not a 
necktie. Now do you think it might 
be permissible for me to continue 
to bear arms against the Skeidzti, 
just in case?” 

Ollie was taken aback, I could 
tell. Almost enough to keep his 
mouth shut He thought for maybe 
a full second before he said any- 
thing. 

“But Mr. Duncan, if the Sten- 
torii knew they were dangerous — ” 
And that did it. I poked a hard 
finger in his chest and backed him 
against the wall. 

“Look, Ollie,” I said grimly, “that 
college line of logic is what got us 
into this jam in the first place. Now 
get this, and remember it. You 
don’t need a degree in Alien Psy- 
chology to know that Rule One is 
never use your own viewpoint as a 
premise in guessing what an alien 
is thinking or doing. It just simply 




106 



107 



doesn’t work that way. An alien’s 
actions are based upon what he 
thinks is reasonable and proper — 
not what you think he ought to 
think. 

“Why do you think we have 
separate Quadrants and private en- 
trances to each room? It sure as 
hell isn’t for economy’s sake, I can 
tell you that. It so happens that 
some of these so-called reasonable 
civilized beings still consider each 
other as rare culinary delights. 
While that sort of nonsense is SOP 
in Free City, this hotel is strictly 
out of bounds. And here’s another 
rule you can put down in Duncan’s 
lectures on Alien Psychology: If 
a guest phones down for a midnight 
snack, he may mean he wants the 
key to his neighbor’s room.” I took 
a deep breath. 

“Am I getting through to you, 
Ollie?” Ollie nodded, wide-eyed, 
and I shoved him into the lift ahead 
of me. We hung for a moment, then 
the gravs caught hold. 

IN my business you learn to get 
along with aliens, or at least 
put up with the ones you can’t pos- 
sibly get along with. And some are 
completely impossible — like the 
Nixies. Except for simple trade re- 
lations, I can’t conceive of anything 
I might have in common with a 
Nixie. 

And there was another rule of 
thumb for Ollie: Never be de- 
ceived by appearances. An alien’s 

108 



resemblance to human form is no 
indication that his outlook will in 
any way resemble human logic and 
reason. Until you know, don’t 
guess; and don’t assume, either, 
that a lack of human form denotes 
a lack of common interest. A Goron 
is a repulsive, warty glob of pink 
and brown protoplasm consisting 
of twelve eyes, nine pseudoarms— 
and an entirely human liking for 
jazz, poetry, Scotch and women 
Or anyway, Goron females. 

On the other hand, ignoring the 
general hairiness and the rodent- 
like features, a Stentorii looks as 
humanoid as I do. He is also a com- 
pletely alien, cold-blooded, mur- 
derous creature without a shred of 
mercy in his body. 

I stared hard at the Stentorii 
who opened the door. He stared 
back at me from tiny red eyes set 
wide on either side of his whiskery 
pink muzzle. Then he saw Ollie 
and gave a high squeaky laugh, 
baring a mouthful of sharp yellow 
teeth. He turned into his room and 
said something in Stentor to his 
companions. They nearly fell apart 

I had had just about enough. 
Time was running out I switched 
on my portable recorder and said: 

“According to Statute XII, Gal- 
actic Standard Code, I wish to in- 
voke the privilege of communicat- 
ing with you; without fear of future 
prosecution in case I may offend, 
by way of accidental implication, 
any tradition, custom or moral 

GALAXY 






standard of your race.” The Sten- 
torii just grinned. I spoke a little 
louder. “I said I speak without of- 
fense!” 

The Stentorii frowned. He didn’t 
like that at all. But he understood 
it. 

“All right,” he said grudgingly, 
“I accept.” 

“Fine,” I said, and let him see 
that I had switched off my record- 
er. I never start an argument with 
an alien without invoking the non- 
offense clause. Of course, the same 
clause is stated in every Registra- 
tion Contract, providing mutual 
protection for the hotel’s guests and 
its employees. But I like to play it 
safe. 

By now the three other Stentorii 
were up, grinning at Ollie. I ignored 
them and spoke to the one at the 
door. 

“My name is Duncan,” I told 
him. “I am manager of the hotel. 
This is my assistant, Mr. Sorren- 
son. I will come right to the point. 
You played a little joke down. in 
the lobby a few minutes ago. Al- 
though this incident is a serious 
breach of your Registration Con- 
tract, I am willing to forget the 
matter if I am able to gain your full 
cooperation. On behalf of Hotel In- 
tergalactica, I formally request you 
recall your Skeidzti immediately 
and turn them over to me for hous- 
ing in the hotel kennel.” 

The Stentorii glanced at his com- 
panions, then turned to me with 

THE STENTORII LUGGAGE 



a look of mock astonishment. 

“Mr. Duncan, do you imply the 
hotel has allowed my pets to be- 
come lost? Naturally, I will hold 
you responsible if they come to any 
harm while in your charge.” I had 
half expected something like this 
I couldn’t do a thing but play it out 

“All right,” I said, “I haven’t time 
to appreciate your humor. You 
know it is illegal to bring unregis- 
tered alien pets into this hotel. I am 
also certain you are aware that we 
are in the Federation Circle, which 
is not in Free City territory — 
which means all guests, by the act 
of signing their Registration Con- 
tracts, place themselves under Fe- 
deration law for the duration of 
their stay here.” 

T HE Stentorii grinned, showing 
X his yellow teeth. 

“Mr. Duncan, you are bluffing. 

I am quite aware of the law, and 
respectfully submit that if you 
check your copy of our Registra- 
tion Contracts you will find your 
employee here countersigned the 
Alien Responsibility Clause.” 

Well, that was his round. I was 
sure he was too oily a character to 
fall for it, but I had had to try. He 
was right. Under our Registration 
Contract it is presumed that while 
the hotel is responsible for a full 
knowledge of the Galactic Customs 
Restrictions, an alien cannot be ex- 
pected to inform the Desk Clerk of 
all possible violations he may be 



109 



guilty of on any particular world. 
And any clerk green enough, or 
stupid enough, or both — like Ollie 
—who signs a Responsibility Clause 
without checking Galactic Customs 
— ought to have his head examined. 
Of course, we could take the Sten- 
torii to court. Maybe we might 
even win, on the grounds of pur- 
poseful malice, but I don’t like to 
get the hotel into law suits. It’s 
bad publicity, and it gives other 
wise guys grand ideas. 

The legal pitch having failed, I 
was ready to continue with Un- 
veiled Threat No. 1. 

“Look,” I said wearily, “I admit 
you are within your legal rights. Al- 
though just how far within I’m not 
too certain at the moment. But be- 
fore you come to any decision let 
me remind you that, while I may 
not be in a position to take official 
action against you, I fully intend to 
file a Warning Report to every 
member of the Galactic Hotel As- 
sociation, which includes nearly 
twelve million first-class hotels and 
their subsidiaries. I don’t know 
what your business is. But since 
you are here I presume it entails 
traveling. Traveling means hotels. 
If you refuse your cooperation, I 
assure you it may be quite difficult 
to find a decent room within twelve 
thousand parsecs of this planet” 
The Stentorii shrugged and 
closed the door on my foot. I’m sure 
he would have hacked it off for a 
souvenir if I hadn’t jerked it out. 



I looked at Ollie. His fists were 
clenched by his side and there was 
a look of iron determination in his 
eyes. 

“Well?” I said. 

“Boy,” said Ollie. “Just wait un- 
til they try to check into a GHA 
hotel again.” 

“Ollie,” I said weakly, “I didn’t 
come up here to actually accom- 
plish anything with those charac- 
ters. It is strictly a matter of form. 
A necessary routine for the record. 
Everything I said went completely 
down the drain. They were not im- 
pressed, frightened or embarrassed 
in any way. It is impossible to rea- 
son with a Stentorii because he is 
inherently incapable of taking any- 
thing you say seriously. He is also 
incapable of caring whether he gets 
a hotel room. Anywhere. Ever. He 
has one now, and the future is 
absolutely of no importance. He 
doesn’t care about you, me, life, 
death or hotel rooms. Didn’t you 
hear anything I said in the lift?” 
“Sure, Mr. Duncan, but—” 
“Ollie. Shut up.” 

1 DITCHED Ollie and stopped 
off at my office for a wake-up 
pill. Greel had his command post 
set up in the Level 12 lobby and I 
joined him there. The lobby was 
full of squat Fensi bellhops, swarm- 
ing in and out of the lifts like agi- 
tated ants. 

Most of my bellhops and some 
of the Administrative staff are Fen- 



110 



GALAXY 



si. I like to have them on the pay- 
roll, and I’d hire fifty more if I 
could get them. Fensi are quick, 
alert, reasonably honest and highly 
adaptable. Their adaptability 
alone makes them worth their 
weight in gold to a big hotel. A 
Fensi can breathe a wide variety of 
atmospheres, take plenty of G’s, 
and doesn’t care whether he’s hot, 
cold or in-between. Unless you’re a 
Fensi, room service around here 
can be a literally killing job. 

Greel sprinted across the lobby, 
a wide smile stretching over his 
hairless blue face . 

“I’m glad you’re so happy,” I 
said. “Maybe you should have 
gone to see our friends upstairs.” 
Greel laughed. “Maybe we won’t 
need ’em, chief. The boys think we 
can clean the Skeidzti out by morn- 
ing — with a little luck, of course.” 
“More than a little, if you ask 
me. Get any yet?” 

Greel held up a finger. “One. 
Skorno picked up an ashtray on 
Ten and it nearly bit his hand off.” 
He nodded toward the desk and 
Ollie and I followed. He picked up 
a small stationery box and pushed 
it toward me. 

“Skorno got it before it could 
change completely — you can see 
what it was trying to do.” 

I could. The object in the box 
was a dead Skeidzti, but only one- 
quarter of it was in its natural form. 
The last thing it had touched was 
Skorno’s hand. Following its blind- 



rule instinct it had imitated a hair- 
less blue Fensi arm nearly up to 
the elbow, before it had either run 
out of material or died. 

Now that it was dead it was 
slowly changing back to its natural 
form. The part we could see re- 
sembled a thin, eight-inch-wide 
worm-like creature with stubby ser- 
rated legs. I figured it could move 
about as fast a caterpillar without 
adapting. It was a highly vulner- 
able creature, and in order to sur- 
vive it had developed a high degree 
of protective camouflage. With its 
soft body and slow speed almost 
anything could pick up a quick and 
easy meal. And its natural color 
didn’t help at all. The dead quarter 
of the Skeidzti was a brilliant, al- 
most phosphorescent orange. 

“Well, son, get some idea what 
we’re up against?” Ollie’s eyes were 
glued to the box and his face was 
as blue as Greel’s. 

“Can they — can they adapt to 
anything?” 

“No,” said Greel, “they have 
limitations. I’m sure they can imi- 
tate most anything, but they 
couldn’t change as quickly under 
six or eight G’s, or, say, in a 
methane atmosphere.” 

“Not for two or three genera- 
tions, anyway,” I added soberly. 
Greel nodded. 

“Anyway, Ollie, the point is 
these varmints are already used to 
a Stentor-Earth atmosphere. And if 
any get out—” 



THE STENTORII LUGGAGE 



111 



“It would be comparable,” I 
added, “to a plague of invisible 
bobcats.” 

I THINK for the first time Ollie 
was hit with the seriousness of 
our problem. I could sense a kind 
of helpless panic in his eyes, as if 
he had suddenly realized he’d 
opened the floodgates and let the 
valve break off in his hand. 

“Mr. Duncan, I — well, maybe 
we ought to get help. I mean — I’ll 
take the blame — and — and — ” He 
was shaking like a leaf. I eased him 
down to a chair. 

“And just what sort of help did 
you have in mind?” I asked. 

“Well, the police! Couldn’t 
you—” 

I shook my head firmly. “No. I 
certainly could not. That, my 
friend, is all we need. The Federa- 
tion would quarantine the hotel, 
rout several thousand guests out of 
their various notions of sleep, and 
raise enough hell to wake every 
DeepDream addict from here to 
Andromeda.” 

“Aside from the fact,” Greel 
added, “that every Skeidzti in the 
hotel could hitch a free ride out of 
here in some cop’s pocket.” 

“Right. No, we can handle it our- 
selves, a hell of a lot quieter. We’ve 
had worse before.” Ollie’s face told 
me he thought I was an out and 
out liar. But then, like I said, this 
kid has a lot to learn about the 
hotel business. 

112 



The Skeidzti had been loose in 
the hotel since 3:00 a.m. By 5:30 
we had killed eight of them. And 
eight Fensi bellhops had bandaged 
hands. 

It was obvious we couldn’t go 
around touching everything in the 
hotel to see if it was real or Skeidz- 
ti. Added was the problem of know- 
ing when we had killed them all. 
The Skeidzti came in disguised as 
four pieces of Stentorii luggage, but 
we had no idea how many had 
clustered together to form each 
piece. And the Stentorii weren’t 
telling. 

I called Greel and Ollie to the 
Desk for a strategy meeting. Ollie 
dropped in a chair and sank into 
brooding silence. Even Greel’s cus- 
tomary optimism seemed to have 
temporarily vanished. He reported 
the bellhops were doing their pok- 
ing with sticks now, but the results 
were still alarmingly low. 

“What we need,” Greel com- 
plained, “is a system.” 

“Yeh, we need a system, all 
right,” added Ollie helpfully. I 
stood up, paced around the Desk. 
The strategy meeting was dying 
on its feet. 

“Look,” I said, “let’s analyze it 
Our problem is to get rid of the 
Skeidzti, right?” 

“Right,” from Greel and Ollie. 

“Okay. Now to kill them we have 
to see them. And by seeing them I 
mean we have to see them as they 
really are.”

“Or catch them during a change,” 
added Greel. 

“Exactly.” Somewhere in the 
back of my head an idea was catch- 
ing hold. I kept talking, trying to 
push it out. 

“Then our problem is this. We 
have to force them to change into 
something we can recognize as a 
definite Skeidzti.” Greel’s frown 
vanished. He sat up straight in his 
chair. 

“You mean, like if we made them 
all change into an object we knew 
we only had one of.” 

“Sort of like that. Only that 
means we’d have to be able to iso- 
late the Skeidzti in a specified area 
—and even if we could do that it’d 
be a hell of a problem to get rid of 
all the objects we didn’t want them 
to imitate. Which means more stick 
poking. Remember, they can flat- 
ten out on the walls and ceiling 
just as easily as they can curl up 
like an ashtray or a sofa pillow.” 
Greel’s face dropped back into a 
disappointed frown. 

“No, you’ve got the general idea,” 
I said quickly. “But I think I’ve got 
a way to work the same thing, only 
quicker.” Greel suddenly looked 
around, and I turned and saw Skor- 
no, our first casualty, coming out 
of the lift. In his bandaged hand he 
held an ominous looking club, and 
in the other a limp and bloody 
throwrug. He stopped before us, 
grinning, and tossed the rug on the 
floor. 



E said, “Three more, chief.” 

I bent down for a closer look. 
This time, three Skeidzti had 
joined to imitate a portion of the 
rug. It was a near-perfect job. They 
had continued the intricate pattern, 
carrying out the design exactly 
where the real rug stopped. The 
only thing wrong, Skomo ex- 
plained, was that he passed the rug 
fifty times a day and knew it was 
about twice as large as it should 
have been. 

Something about Skomo’s rug 
worried me. I asked him how long 
he thought it took for the Skeidzti 
to change from one form to another. 

“About half a second,” he said. 
“But I think it varies, depending 
on what they’re imitating.” 

“For instance?” 

“Well, on a plain surface, like a 
wall or something, they’re faster- 
much faster.” 

“You mean,” I asked, “if they 
have something more complicated 
to imitate, it takes longer?" Skomo 
shook his head. 

“I wish it did. When I said it 
varies, I meant just the first few 
times. Once they’ve imitated some- 
thing, they don’t forget it” 

‘Well, hell,” I snapped, “I know 
they can’t imitate simultaneously! 
There has to be some definite mini- 
mum time lapse!” Skomo spread 
his hands helplessly. 

“I know, chief. But whatever it 
is, it’s too small to do us much 
good. They’re just too fast for our 




114 



GALAXY 



reaction time. We still only get 
about one out of every ten we see.” 
Swell, I thought. If they were too 
fast for the Fensi, we were really 
up the creek. 

“What about spraying a low- 
charge disrupter all over the place 
and picking up the pieces?” said 
Greel hopefully. 

Skomo said, “I forgot to men- 
tion that with a low-charge you 
have to hit them in just the right 
place or they’re only knocked out 
for awhile.” 

“And while they’re unconscious 
they’re just as safe as ever,” I fin- 
ished for him. Then Skomo’s 
words suddenly sank in. “Good 
Lord! Do you mean you’re using 
high-charge disrupters— inside this 
hotel!” 

Skorno nodded sheepishly. 
“What else can we do, chief? Sure, 
the place looks like a two-cluster 
cruiser plowed through. But we’re 
getting ’em, slow but sure.” 

I was beginning to get a little 
bit mad. I thought about the Sten- 
torii, sleeping peacefully in their 
rooms while we blasted four levels 
of valuable real estate looking for 
their damnable pets. And what, I 
asked myself, are we doing about 
it? Mooning around in the lobby 
on our respective rears, that’s what 
we are doing. I stood up again, glar- 
ing at Ollie on general principles. 

“All right,” I said firmly. “This 
has gone far enough, gentlemen. 
I’m not saying there is any other 

THE STENTORI! LUGGAGE 



way to finish off this mess, but I 
do have one humble idea that might 
save a little of Hotel Intergalacti- 
ca’s property. I figure as long as 
we’re going to turn this place into 
a shooting gallery we might as well 
have something to shoot at.” 

I went over our floor plan with 
Greel and Skomo and picked out 
an area where the Skeidzti had 
proven particularly obnoxious. 
Then I sent Greel to seal off the 
other contaminated levels, and 
told Skorno to marshal his forces 
in Humanoid Hall. I picked Hu- 
manoid Hall for two reasons: One, 
plenty of Skeidzti to work on, and 
two, a minimum of furniture. For 
previously stated reasons I kept 
Ollie with me, and hopped a Class- 
A lift for Level Eight. 

"\/T ORE than once I’ve had good 
reason to be thankful we en- 
force strong lift security measures. 
No matter where the Skeidzti 
might go, I was dead sure they 
would never reach guest quarters. 

There’s a good reason for this. 
We ordinarily house about thirty 
thousand guests in the hotel at any 
one time. That number represents 
five to fifteen thousand separate 
races, each one requiring its own 
unique set of conditions. In Quad- 
rant Four IVe got Denebian Ice- 
worms at -200 F. right “next door” 
to a cluster of Calistan Feroids 
sleeping soundly in boiling mer- 
cury. No problem. We can handle 



115 



1,240 different atmospheres, with 
innumerable variations in density, 
temperature and lighting. 

The real problem is sociological, 
not mechanical. If the Galaxy is 
old, the oldest thing in it are its 
grudges. To put it bluntly, some 
of these characters have hated each 
other’s guts so long they forgot why 
about two million years ago. 

Naturally, an Altaran isn’t going 
to walk into a Vegan’s room and 
strangle him. There’s a problem of 
about 900 degrees and thirty G’s 
to overcome first. But that’s no real 
problem either — about 500,000 
years ago they swarmed all over 
each other’s planets in protective 
armor, and strangling was the 
nicest thing that happened. 

And that’s where we come in. 

What they do outside Hotel In- 
tergalactica is none of our business 
— but inside we make sure no one 
is faced with temptation. That’s 
why our room segregation is verti- 
cal instead of horizontal. The hotel 
is built on the hive principle. Each 
cell or room has a private entrance 
bordering on the lift. There are no 
halls or corridors to wander around 
in, and any connecting rooms con- 
nect up and down. No exceptions. 

It’s a necessary rule and we en- 
force it. There are plenty of Com- 
mon Rooms on the opposite side of 
the lifts for conferences and 
amiable gatherings— free of charge. 

We work it that way for eco- 
nomical reasons, too. It’s a lot easier 



to, say, keep a gravitic lift at 9G 
constant for a Cygnian than to 
change it to forty-five for a Lyri 
passenger. Everybody minds then- 
own business — and nobody waits 
for an elevator. 

That’s where lift security comes 
in. 

We run a high density force- 
shield over each lift entrance. Try 
to enter one that’s not attuned to 
your requirements and you run 
smack into an invisible wall. Which 
is precisely what would happen if 
the Skeidzti tried it. Imitation is 
one thing. Fortunately, duplication 
is another. 

It suddenly dawned on me that 
here was the real reason the Sten- 
torii played their little joke on 
Ollie. They knew the Skeidzti 
couldn’t get by the lift shields, so 
they didn’t even try. A typical bit 
of Stentorii humor, I thought wry- 
ly. Don’t dump your problems just 
anywhere — toss *em where they 
can do some good. 

1 KNEW pretty well what to ex- 
pect on Level Eight. 

It was worse. 

What did Skorno say? Like 
a two-cluster cruiser plowed 
through? It was more like a com- 
plete reinactment of the Battle 
of the Rim. 

Through a low cloud of acrid 
blue smoke I made out the dim 
outlines of Fensi bellhops, lined up 
in military order across the room. 



116 



GALAXY 



Skorno groped toward me through 
the wreckage. I put a handkerchief 
to my nose and stumbled out to 
meet him, Ollie choking along be- 
hind. The air was full of the smell 
of fused plastic, burnt carpeting 
and a particularly nauseous odor I 
identified as fried Skeidzti. 

“Are you sure there’s anything 
left alive up here?” I asked. Skorno 
nodded, breathing in the poisonous 
atmosphere like fresh country air. 

“Sure, chief, they’re here all 
right. You just can’t see ’em.” He 
nodded toward the ready Fensi 
crew. “We’re all here, I think. What 
next?” 

“Nothing,” I choked, “until this 
smoke clears away. What happened 
to the air conditioning?” 

“Greel’s working on it. We had 
to block off some of the' vents. 
Grid’s not fine enough to keep out 
a Skeidzti.” I looked up. The air 
was already beginning to clear. I 
gave it a few more minutes, then 
stepped up on a scorched sofa. I 
was anxious to get started so I cut 
it as short as possible. The idea, I 
explained, was to take advantage 
of the fact that there was a lapse, 
however small it might be, between 
the time a Skeidzti could change 
from one form to another. Catch 
them in that stage, and we had ’em. 
Simple as that, if it worked. 

I lined the Fensi in a crude cir- 
cle in the center of the room, fac- 
ing outwards. Then I pulled some 
debris together for a shield, jerked 

THE STENTORII LUGGAGE 



Ollie down behind it and dimmed 
the lights. Dimmed them — not 
turned them off. The idea was to 
force the Skeidzti to adapt to new 
lighting conditions, and I was afraid 
if I turned them off altogether 
they’d sense they were safe in the 
absolute darkness and not adapt 
at all. 

I gave them plenty of time, dim- 
ming the lights slowly until I could 
hardly tell they were on at all. 
Then I pressed the switch for maxi- 
mum brightness and the room was 
flooded with brilliant light. 

And there they were. They were 
fast, but not faster than the speed 
of light. For nearly a full second 
they stood out like ink spots on a 
clean white sheet, and we poured 
it on ’em. They were stunned per- 
haps a quarter-second past their 
normal reaction time. The Fensi 
are fast anyway, and that quarter- 
second margin was all they needed. 
We went through the routine three 
more times, then had to wait for the 
smoke to clear. We had killed thir- 
ty-seven Skeidzti. 

Fine. But it gave me something 
to think about. 

We had estimated there were at 
most fifty or sixty Skeidzti loose— 
and if we had killed thirty-seven on 
one level, in one room — how many 
did that mean were left? I men- 
tioned it to Greel. He shrugged it 
off with typical Fensi optimism. 

“What difference does it make, 
chief? We’ve got ’em on the run!” 

117 



“Sure,” I said cautiously, “we’ve 
got ’em on the run now, all right.” 
Both Greel and Skomo were grin- 
ning from ear to ear, having the 
time of their lives. 

But I wasn’t sure at all. Some- 
thing kept asking me how long it 
would be before the Skeidzti 
caught on to the system — and 
whether we could come up fast 
enough with something to meet 
them. Before I left I gave explicit 
instructions to keep all isolation 
shields up — even after they were 
sure a room was clean. Greel gave 
a resigned shrug. I could tell they 
both thought the old man was tak- 
ing the sport of Skeidzti hunting 
entirely too seriously. 

Back in the lobby I sank into a 
chair and lit a cigarette. Ollie 
brought coffee, and we stared 
bleary-eyed at each other for half 
an hour. Ollie obviously didn’t feel 
like talking and I was too damn 
tired to chew him out anymore. I 
could tell he was giving it to him- 
self pretty hard anyway. That was 
probably doing more good than 
anything I could say. 

P OOR Ollie! If nothing else, one 
night of crisis at Hotel Inter- 
galactica had rubbed off a consid- 
erable amount of shiny college ex- 
terior. His perfectly trimmed hair 
was caked with ceiling plaster. His 
neat bow tie dangled from his 
neck like last night’s lettuce, and 
somehow he had managed to 



crack one side of his gold-rimmed 
glasses. He was beginning to look 
exactly like what he was supposed 
to be — a harried night clerk, who 
wished to hell he could remember 
why he had ever thought of going 
into the hotel business. 

At 7:20 I located my army on 
the intercom. They had finished 
Eight, Nine and Ten, and were 
mopping up on Eleven. I told Greel 
to split his crew and send half up to 
Thirteen. We gulped the last of our 
coffee and headed down to Eleven. 

I breathed a sigh of relief. 
Eleven wasn’t nearly as bad as 
Eight. Either the Fensi had im- 
proved their marksmanship or the 
light trick was cutting out a lot of 
random shooting. Greel walked up, 
holstering his weapon. 

“Well,” I asked, “what do you 
think?” 

“I think we just may survive the 
night,” he said tiredly. “I’m going 
to try one more go-around here, 
then move up to Twelve.” 

“I have purposely been avoiding 
that thought,” I said dryly, pictur- 
ing the grinning Fensi horde blast- 
ing through my expensive lobby. 
“And of course,” I added casually, 
“we haven’t really seen any Skeid- 
zti in the lobby, Greel. It may be 
that — ah — ” Greel shot me a sus- 
picious glance and I shut up. So 
who needs a lobby? 

Greel reloaded his disruptor — 
a little too eagerly, I thought - 
and leaned against the wall. 

GALAXY 



“Actually,” he said, “I don’t pic- 
ture it being too bad on Twelve.” 

“You don’t, huh?” I said doubt- 
fully. 

“No, I mean it, chief. Funny 
thing, they were as thick as flies 
on Eight and Nine, but on Ten, and 
here on Eleven — they seem to be 
sort of thinning out” I raised an 
eyebrow at that. 

“I don’t suppose there could be 
a leaky shield, somewhere, or they 
might be catching on to that light 
trick.” 

“Oh, no,” Greel insisted, “we’re 
getting them all. They’re just not 
as thick is all. I figure when they 
got loose on Twelve they all high- 
tailed it down to the lower floors 
for some reason, maybe to make—” 

I grabbed Greel’s arm and 
squeezed it hard. Something he 
had said suddenly sent a cold chill 
down my neck. Greel looked puz- 
zled. I motioned him and Ollie to 
a quiet corner of the room, then 
turned to Greel. 

“Did you send half your crew 
up to Thirteen?” I asked carefully. 

Greel shrugged. “Sure, chief. 
You said—” 

“Okay. Now think. I want to 
know exactly how many men you 
had here — before you split the 
crew.” Greel thought. 

“Forty-eight.” 

“Exactly forty-eight?” 

“Exactly. I’m sure because it’s 
the whole night shift for the Quad- 
rant and everyone’s on duty.” 

THE STENTORI I LUGGAGE 



“Mr. Duncan,” said Ollie, “what 
are you — ” 

I cut him off sharply. “Hold it, 
Ollie. Whatever it is can wait.” I 
turned back to Greel. “Then if you 
split your crew, we should have 
twenty-four men in this room. 
Right?” Greel nodded. He started 
to speak, gave me a puzzled frown 
instead. He turned and carefully 
counted his crew. 

“Oh, my God!” he said. 

“I get thirty-six,” I told him. 
“Ollie?” Ollie nodded, wide-eyed. 
I felt Greel stiffen beside me. I 
looked, and his hand was sliding 
toward his holster. 

“Hold it,” I said. “There’s one 
way to make sure.” 

I checked on the intercom with 
Skorno on thirteen. Skorno 
counted twenty-four men. I nod- 
ded to Greel and Ollie. 

T HAD wondered what the Ske- 

idzti would come up with to 
counter our move. Now I knew. 
They had done the only thing they 
could do. They had imitated the 
most common thing in the room, 
the only thing that wasn’t being 
blasted to shreds by the disrup- 
tors: the Fensi themselves. 

I walked quickly to the center 
of the room. 

“Attention, everyone,” I yelled. 
“Line up against the wall, quick!” 
I watched them carefully, getting 
dizzy trying to spot the phonies. 

“I’m going to tell you this once,” 



118 



119 




I said. “Listen, and get it right!” I 
told them right off that twelve of 
them were fakes. They caught on 
fast, knowing better than anyone 
what the Skeidzti were capable of. 
I wasn’t worried about warning the 
Skeidzti. Whatever they were, 
they were no more intelligent than 
a well-trained dog. 



“There is going to be some 
shooting,” I said. “Ignore it and do 
exactly as I say.” I paused, and 
Ollie and Greel drew their weap- 
ons. 

“All right, first man. When I say 
go, walk to the lift and drop to Ten. 
Go!” The first Fensi walked to the 
lift and disappeared. 

GALAXY 



“Second man, go!” 

“Third man, go!” The third 
Fensi walked to the lift, exactly 
like the first two. Only that was as 
far as he could go. 

Ollie, Greel and I burned him 
before he could change. 

Then it happened. The Skeidzti 
sensed something wrong. Eleven 

THE STENTORII LUGGAGE 



fakes suddenly bolted for the lift. 
The real Fensi ignored my order 
and joined the shooting. I yelled 
but no one could hear me. 

Suddenly the whole area about 
the lift erupted in blinding blue 
flame. I shielded my face and felt 
a sharp pain in my side as the floor 
came up to meet me. 



120

Greel was on his feet first. I 
shook my head and limped over 
to him. There was a large jagged 
hole in the wall and I knew right 
away what it was, even before I 
saw the tangled mass of fused wire 
and metal. I picked up a hunk of 
carpet and tossed it down the lift. 
Then I went limp all over. 

The carpet went down the lift 
as smooth as any living thing. The 
shields were down. The Skeidzti 
had the run of the whole Quad- 
rant. 

Greel was giving his crew a royal 
chewing out. I cut him off and 
ordered the Fensi to Level Twelve, 
on the double. It was too damn 
late for chewing out now. We were 
in real trouble. I looked around for 
Ollie. He was gone. I cursed my- 
self and kicked a piece of furniture 
halfway across the room. That’s 
all I needed — the Skeidzti and 
Ollie running loose. 

“Greel! Check the inner shields, 
see if we’ve still got anything 
sealed off in this place!” 

“I did. So far as I can tell it’s 
just the lift.” 

“That’s bad enough,” I said 
grimly. “On this side of the lift 
they’re open to anything one room 
deep. And on the other side, the 
first guest who steps out of his 
room will—” Greel shook his head 
violently. I brightened, suddenly 
remembering. We had already 
sealed the guest side and I knew 
the two sides were controlled sep- 



arately. Unless something else 
happened, we still had them sealed 
into the lift with access restricted 
to the Common Rooms, kitchens 
and ballrooms. They were still 
within the Quadrant, and away 
from the guests. 

66 A LL right,” I said as calmly as 
possible, “we start jover. It 
means maybe eighty floors of iso- 
lation, and they won’t fall for that 
light trick again. We’ll have to 
escort every guest through the lift 
and arrange for alternate dining 
areas. And I want every Fensi 
tested through a shield that? s work- 
ing. I don’t think they’ll try that 
again, but—” 

The intercom crackled and 
Skorno’s voice came on high and 
frantic. 

“Chief! Listen, that crazy kid 
has opened the shields! He broke 
into Central Control and let down 
every barrier in the Quadrant!” 

“What! Why in — look, it may 
be too late but try to get the damn 
things up again. Quick!” 

Skorno moaned. “I can’t. He’s 
fused the controls! I can’t even 
find the cut-off switch!” I felt a 
sharp pain in my mouth and real- 
ized I was trying to bite my tongue 
off. If I ever got my hands on that 
kid— 

“Listen, Skorno, find him! I 
don’t care what you do to him, 
just find him!” 

“I can’t figure it,” moaned Greel.

“He must have gone completely 
off his rocker.” 

“He had better be off his rocker,” 
I said grimly. “That’s the only 
thing that’s going to save him from 
me.” The intercom sputtered 
again. Ollie. Somehow, I knew be- 
fore he even spoke. 

“Mr. Duncan, listen, I had to do 
it. I couldn’t tell you because I 
knew you’d—” 

“Listen, you little punk — ” 
growled Greel. I frowned and 
shook my head. 

“Ollie,” I said gently, “this is 
Mr. Duncan. I understand. I’m not 
angry. Not at all. Now listen, Ollie. 
I know you’re not feeling well. 
You’re tired, Ollie. Tell us where 
you are and we’ll come and get 
you — help you, I mean—” 

“Listen,” Ollie said angrily, “I’m 
not crazy. Now pay attention and 
do what I say — exactly!” I swal- 
lowed. He was gone, all right. 

“Yes, Ollie. We’re listening. Go 
ahead.” 

His voice relaxed. “I’m on Eigh- 
teen. The Crystal Ballroom.” I 
swallowed again. My beautiful 
new ballroom. 

“Come up through the loading 
entrance,” Ollie went on. “You’ll 
enter at Lift, ah — Forty-five, Hu- 
manoid Kitchen annex.” 

“Yes, Ollie. We’ll do that.” 

“And Mr. Duncan^” 

“Yes, Ollie?” 

‘This is not a threat, sir. But 
don’t bring any weapons.” 

THE STENTORII LUGGAGE 



“Oh—” The intercom went dead. 
Ollie was through talkin g , 

‘Well?” said Greel. 

‘Well what?” I snapped. “Do 
you want to flush him out of 
there?” 

Greel shrugged. “Lift Forty-five 
is this way, chief.” 

4~hLLIE let us into the kitchen. 

The smell nearly knocked us 
back into the lift. 

“Gahhhh! What is it, Ollie!” 

“Ghayschi stew,” he said. “Pretty 
horrible, isn’t it? Here. Wear 
these.” He tossed me a box and I 
quickly jammed two of the Chefs 
Little Wonder Air Filters into my 
nose and passed the box to Greel. 
Ghayschi stew, I thought. The kid 
has really flipped. 

“Ollie—” Then I stopped. He 
was evidently not kidding. His 
eyes were a little too bright and 
his face was wet and glistening. 
Also, he had a disruptor in his 
hand. 

“It’s on low charge,” he said, 
“but I don’t want to knock any- 
body out, Mr. Duncan. I got us 
into this mess and I’ve got to get 
us out — my own way.” He paused. 
“Now,” he said, “will you give me 
a hand with this pot?” I shot him a 
skeptical glance. 

“Why? Where are we taking 
it?” Ollie tensed. 

“Mr. Duncan,” he pleaded, 
“you’ve got to trust me!” 



123 



“Trust you! You’ve wrecked my 
hotel, let those infernal pests 
loose, and you — you stand there 
with a gun in your hand and ask me 
to trust you? Move the damn pot 
yourself!” Ollie seemed to think a 
minute, then a hurt expression 
spread over his face. 

“All right,” he said calmly. “If I 
give you the gun, will you help me? 
You said yourself the hotel is 
wrecked. Why not give me a 
chance?” 

I took a deep breath and let it 
out slowly. 

“Okay, Ollie. Give me the gun.” 
Ollie handed me the disruptor. 
Greel started to move and I mo- 
tioned him back. Ollie was right. I 
really had absolutely nothing to 
lose. 

I grabbed one end of the pot. 
“This way,” said Ollie, shoving 
open the door to the ballroom. 
“Here?” Ollie nodded. 

The Crystal Ballroom is new, 
and I’m proud of it. The floor is 
imported Denebian seaglass and 
the walls are Serinese protomu- 
rals. When the murals are on and 
the floor is lit, there isn’t a hotel 
in the system that can touch it. I 
cringed as we set the large pot of 
Ghayschi stew square in the mid- 
dle of the seaglass floor. 

“Now what?” I asked. 

“Now we get out of here. Quick.” 
I followed him back to the kitchen. 
Behind him he trailed a long, thin 



wire. One end was attached to the 
top of the pot. Greel and I watched 
in silent wonder as he pulled the 
wire through the kitchen and into 
a tiny room off the kitchen pantry. 

I knew where we were; it was 
the light control booth for the sea- 
glass floor. I had shown it to Ollie 
several days before. 

Ollie seated himself at the con- 
trol board and began to play the 
lights. Through a small window I 
could see the ballroom, and the 
huge pot of Ghayschi stew. The 
floor began to glow, pulsing from 
gold to blue to green and back 
again. Ollie experimented a while, 
then seemed to be satisfied. 

“Now,” he said finally, without 
turning away from the controls, 
“we are ready.” I raised an eye- 
brow at Greel. Both of us were 
wondering just exactly what we 
were ready for. 

“Fortunately,” said Ollie, “the 
ballroom itself doesn’t border di- 
rectly onto one of the unshielded 
lifts. The anteroom shield is still 
up, though. And now—” he pressed 
a button by his chair— “it’s down.” 
Greel and I exchanged another 
look. 

“Next,” said Ollie suddenly, 
“dinnertime.” 

I shut my eyes. Ollie jerked his 
wire. The pot tipped and the gray 
and brown viscous mess of Ghay- 
schi stew spread slowly across the 
ballroom floor. 



“Now what?” I asked cautiously. 
“Now we wait. I’ve turned on 
the auxiliary blowers. The smell 
is spreading through the Skeidtzi 
occupied areas.” I had a few choice 
comments on this move, but I 
kept them to myself. This was 
Ollie’s party. I figured I could al- 
ways strangle him later. 

We waited ten minutes. 

Then Ollie suddenly went into 
action. His hands swept over the 
light control board and the sea- 
glass floor danced and pulsed with 
shifting colors, shifting faster and 
faster through the spectrum. I 
watched Ollie’s face. His skin was 
tight and great beads of sweat 
poured from his forehead down his 
neck. Then the tense mask sud- 
denly broke and a wide grin spread 
over his face. 

“Look!” he yelled, nodding 
toward the floor. 

I looked. At first there was noth- 
ing to see. Then I rubbed my eyes. 
The fast-changing lights must have 
affected my vision because the 
whole floor seemed alive with 
bright orange spots. 

Then it hit me. Skeidzti! The 
floor around the stew was crowded 
three deep with them — and they 
were all changing back to their 
natural form! 

We watched for an hour and a 
half. Finally Ollie jerked a lever 
and the colors faded away. He 
sank weakly back in his chair. I 
felt cold all over, and suddenly 



realized I was soaking wet. Later, 
we counted two hundred seventy- 
nine dead Skeidzti on the ballroom 
floor. 

It was all over. 

T HAD plenty of questions but I 
-*■ saved them until after break- 
fast. Some of it I could figure out, 
but I still didn’t know how Ollie 
had been sure the Skeidzti would 
eat his infernal stew. 

“Oh, I knew they’d like it,” said 
Ollie. “Ghayschi stew is a favorite 
Stentorii dish. I looked it up. I 
figured the Skeidzti ate table 
scraps.” 

“That I can guess,” I said. “But 
when they couldn’t keep up with 
the changing lights why didn’t they 
stop eating? Were they too stupid 
to know they either had to give up 
a meal or die?” 

“No,” said Ollie, “not stupid. 
They just couldn’t help them- 
selves. I figured any animal that 
could adapt so quickly and move 
around so fast was bound to have 
a pretty high metabolism. Any 
animal like that has to eat, oh, 
maybe six or eight times his 
weight in food every day or starve 
to death. They came into the ho- 
tel at 3:00. When I turned on the 
lights upstairs it was nearly ten 
o’clock. After seven hours they had 
to eat. There was nothing in the 
world that could have stopped 
them.” Ollie paused, sipped his 
coffee.

“They finally adjusted to your 
light trick because they had no 
alternative stronger than survival. 
I used the same idea, but this time 
they had to make an impossible 
choice between two basic in- 
stincts.” 

“And they couldn’t,” I added. 
“So to avoid it they sort of, what— 
died of a nervous breakdown?” 
“Something like that. In school 
there was this thing about some 
old experiments where a chicken 
or a rat was trained to certain re- 
sponses, then the responses were 
mixed or taken away and — ” 



I yawned and got up to leave. 
“Sure, Ollie,” I said. “Let’s be sure 
and talk about it some time.” J 
started for the door. 

“Mr. Duncan—?” 

“Yes?” 

“Am I fired?” 

I thought a minute. I was so 
tired I could hardly hear him. 

“No, Ollie,” I said wearily, “j 
don’t think so. There’s just one 
thing, though.” 

“Sir?” 

“Keep,” I said sternly, “the hell 
out of my kitchens!”

T HE pockets of Mr. Hum- 
phrey Fownes were being 
picked outrageously. 

It was a splendid day. The tem- 
perature was a crisp 59 degrees, the 
humidity a mildly dessicated 47 %. 
The sun was a flaming orange ball 
in a cloudless blue sky. 

His pockets were picked eleven 
times. 



Illustrated by DILLON 

It should have been difficult. Un- 
der the circumstances it was a mas- 
terpiece of pocket picking. What 
made it possible was Humphrey 
Fownes’ abstraction; he was an un- 
commonly preoccupied individual. 
He was strolling along a quiet resi- 
dential avenue: small private 

houses, one after another, a place of 
little traffic and minimum distrac-

tions. But he was thinking about 
weather, which was an unusual sub- 
ject to begin with for a person liv- 
ing in a domed city. He was think- 
ing so deeply about it that it never 
occurred to him that entirely too 
many people were bumping into 
him. He was thinking about Opti- 
mum Dome Conditions (a crisp 59 
degrees, a mildly dessicated 47 % ) 
when a bogus postman, who pre- 
tended to be reading a postal card, 
jostled him. In the confusion of 
spilled letters and apologies from 
both sides, the postman rifled 
Fownes’s handkerchief and inside 
jacket pockets. 

H E was still thinking about tem- 
perature and humidity when a 
pretty girl happened along with 
something in her eye. They col- 
lided. She got his right and left 
jacket pockets. It was much too 
much for coincidence. The side- 
walk was wide enough to allow 
four people to pass at one time. He 
should surely have become suspi- 
cious when two men engaged in a 
heated argument came along. In 
the ensuing contretemps they emp- 
tied his rear pants pockets, got his 
wristwatch and restored the con- 
tents of the handkerchief pocket. It 
all went off very smoothly, like a 
game of put and take — the sole 
difference being that Humphrey 
Fownes had no idea he was playing. 

There was an occasional tinkle 
of falling glass. 



It fell on the streets and houses, 
making small geysers of shiny mist, 
hitting with a gentle musical sound, 
like the ephemeral droppings of a 
celesta. It was precipitation pecul- 
iar to a dome: feather-light frag- 
ments showering harmlessly on the 
city from time to time. Dome wee- 
vils, their metal arms reaching out 
with molten glass, roamed the huge 
casserole, ceaselessly patching and 
repairing. 

Humphrey Fownes strode 
through the puffs of falling glass 
still intrigued by a temperature 
that was always 59 degrees, by a 
humidity that was always 47%, by 
weather that was always Optimum. 
It was this rather than skill that 
enabled the police to maintain such 
a tight surveillance on him, a sur- 
veillance that went to the extent 
of getting his fingerprints off the 
postman’s bag, and which photo- 
graphed, X-rayed and chemically 
analyzed the contents of his pock- 
ets before returning them. Two 
blocks away from his home a care- 
less housewife spilled a five-pound 
bag of flour as he was passing. It 
was really plaster of Paris. He left 
his shoe prints, stride measurement, 
height, weight and handedness be- 
hind. 

By the time Fownes reached his 
front door an entire dossier com- 
plete with photographs had been 
prepared and was being read by 
two men in an orange patrol car 
parked down the street. 



L ANFIERRE had undoubtedly 
been affected by his job. 
Sitting behind the wheel of the 
orange car, he watched Humphrey 
Fownes approach with a distinct 
feeling of admiration, although it 
was an odd, objective kind of ad- 
miration, clinical in nature. It was 
similar to that of a pathologist ob- 
serving for the first time a new and 
particularly virulent strain of pneu- 
mococcus under his microscope. 

Lanfierre’s job was to ferret out 
aberration. It couldn’t be tolerated 
within the confines of a dome. Con- 
formity had become more than a 
social force; it was a physical neces- 
sity. And, after years of working at 
it, Lanfierre had become an admirer 
of eccentricity. He came to see that 
genuine quirks were rare and, as 
time went on, due partly to his own 
small efforts, rarer. 

Fownes was a masterpiece of 
queerness. He was utterly inexpli- 
cable. Lanfierre was almost proud 
of Humphrey Fownes. 

“Sometimes his house shakes,” 
Lanfierre said. 

“House shakes,” Lieutenant Mac- 
Bride wrote in his notebook. Then 
he stopped and frowned. He re- 
read what he’d just written. 

“You heard right. The house 
shakes,” Lanfierre said, savoring it. 

MacBride looked at the Fownes 
house through the magnifying glass 
of the windshield. “Like from . 
side to side?” he asked in a some- 
what patronizing tone of voice. 



“And up and down.” 

MacBride returned the note- 
book to the breast pocket of his 
orange uniform. “Go on,” he said, 
amused. “It sounds interesting.” He 
tossed the dossier carelessly on the 
back seat. 

Lanfierre sat stiffly behind the 
wheel, affronted. The cynical Mac- 
Bride couldn’t really appreciate 
fine aberrations. In some ways 
MacBride was a barbarian. Lan- 
fierre had held out on Fownes for 
months. He had even contrived to 
engage him in conversation once, a 
pleasantly absurd, irrational little 
chat that titillated him for weeks. 
It was only with the greatest reluc- 
tance that he finally mentioned 
Fownes to MacBride. After years 
of searching for differences Lan- 
fierre had seen how extraordinarily 
repetitious people were, echoes 
really, dimly resounding echoes, 
each believing itself whole and 
separate. They spoke in an inces- 
sant chatter of cliches, and then- 
actions were unbelievably trite. 

Then a fine robust freak came 
along and the others — the^echoes 
— refused to believe it. The lieu- 
tenant was probably on the point 
of suggesting a vacation. 

“Why don’t you take a vaca- 
tion?” Lieutenant MacBride sug- 
gested. 

“It’s like this, MacBride. Do you 
know what a wind is? A breeze? A 
zephyr?” 

“I’ve heard some.”

“They say there are mountain- 
tops where winds blow all the time. 
Strong winds, MacBride. Winds 
like you and I can’t imagine. And 
if there was a house sitting on such 
a mountain and if winds did blow, 
it would shake exactly the way that 
one does. Sometimes I get the feel- 
ing the whole place is going to slide 
off its foundation and go sailing 
down the avenue.” 

¥ IEUTENANT MacBride 
pursed his lips. 

“I’ll tell you something else,” 
Lanfierre went on. “The windows 
all close at the same time. You’ll 
be watching and all of a sudden 
every single window in the place 
will drop to its sill.” Lanfierre 
leaned back in the seat, his eyes 
still on the house. “Sometimes I 
think there’s a whole crowd of peo- 
ple in there waiting for a signal — 
as if they all had something impor- 
tant to say but had to close the win- 
dows first so no one could hear. 
Why else close the windows in a 
domed city? And then as soon as 
the place is buttoned up they all ex- 
plode into conversation— and that’s 
why the house shakes.” 

MacBride whistled. 

“No, I don’t need a vacation.” 

A falling piece of glass dissolved 
into a puff of gossamer against the 
windshield. Lanfierre started and 
bumped his knee on the steering 
wheel. 

“No, you don’t need a rest,” Mac- 



Bride said. “You’re starting to see 
flying houses, hear loud babbling 
voices. You’ve got winds in y 0Ur 
brain, Lanfierre, breezes of fatigu e 
zephyrs of irrationality—” 

At that moment, all at once 
every last window in the house 
slammed shut 

The street was deserted and 
quiet, not a movement, not a sound. 
MacBride and Lanfierre both 
leaned forward, as if waiting for the 
ghostly babble of voices to com- 
mence. 

The house began to shake. 

It rocked from side to side, it 
pitched forward and back, it yawed 
and dipped and twisted, straining 
at the mooring of its foundation. 
The house could have been prepar- 
ing to take off and sail down the . 

MacBride looked at Lanfierre 
and Lanfierre looked at MacBride 
and then they both looked back at 
the dancing house. 

“And the water,” Lanfierre said. 
“The water he uses! He could be 
the thirstiest and cleanest man in 
the city. He could have a whole 
family of thirsty and clean kids, 
and he still wouldn’t need all that 
water.” 

The lieutenant had picked up 
the dossier. He thumbed through 
the pages now in amazement 
“Where do you get a guy like this?” 
he asked. “Did you see what he car- 
ries in his pockets?” 

“And compasses won’t work on 
this street.”

The lieutenant lit a cigarette and 
sighed. 

He usually sighed when making 
the decision to raid a dwelling. It 
expressed his weariness and dis- 
taste for people who went off and 
got neurotic when they could be 
enjoying a happy, normal exist- 
ence. There was something implac- 
able about his sighs. 

“He’ll be coming out soon,” Lan- 
fierre said. “He eats supper next 
door with a widow. Then he goes to 
the library. Always the same. Sup- 
per at the widow’s next door and 
then the library.” 

MacBride’s eyebrows went up a 
fraction of an inch. “The library?” 
he said. “Is he in. with that bunch?” 

Lanfierre nodded. 

“Should be very interesting,” 
MacBride said slowly. 

“I can’t wait to see what he’s got 
in there,” Lanfierre murmured, 
watching the house with a consum- 
ing interest. 

They sat there smoking in si- 
lence and every now and then their 
eyes widened as the house danced 
a new step. 

"C’ OWNES stopped on the porch 
to brush the plaster of paris off 
his shoes. He hadn’t seen the patrol 
car and this intense preoccupation 
of his was also responsible for the 
dancing house— he simply hadn’t 
noticed. There was a certain 
amount of vibration, of course. He 
had a bootleg pipe connected into 



the dome blower system, and the 
high-pressure air caused some 
buffeting against the thin walls of 
the house. At least, he called it 
buffeting; he’d never thought to 
watch from outside. 

He went in and threw his jacket 
on the sofa, there being no room 
left in the closets. Crossing the liv- 
ing room he stopped to twist a 
draw-pull. 

Every window slammed shut. 

“Tight as a kite,” he thought, 
satisfied. He continued on toward 
the closet at the foot of the stairs 
and then stopped again. Was that 
right? No, snug as a hug in a rug. 
He went on, thinking: The old 
devils. 

The downstairs closet was like a 
great watch case, a profusion of 
wheels surrounding the Master 
Mechanism, which was a minia- 
ture see-saw that went back and 
forth 365 times an hour. The 
wheels had a curious stateliness 
about them. They were all quite 
old, salvaged from grandfather’s 
clocks and music boxes and they 
went around in graceful circles at 
the rate of 30 and 3 1 times an hour 
. although there was one slightly 
eccentric cam that vacillated be- 
tween 28 and 29. He watched as 
they spun and flashed in the dark- 
ness, and then set them for seven 
o’clock in the evening, April sev- 
enth, any year. 

Outside, the domed city van- 
ished. 

GALAXY 



It was replaced by an illusion. 
Or, as Fownes hoped it might ap- 
pear, the illusion of the domed city 
vanished and was replaced by a 
more satisfactory, and, for his spe- 
cific purpose, more functional, illu- 
sion. Looking through the window 
he saw only a garden. 

Instead of an orange sun at per- 
petual high noon, there was a red 
sun setting brilliantly, marred only 
by an occasional arcover which left 
the smell of ozone in the air. There 
was also a gigantic moon. It hid a 
huge area of sky, and it sang. The 
sun and moon both looked down 
upon a garden that was itself scin- 
tillant, composed largely of neon 
roses. 

Moonlight, he thought, and roses. 
Satisfactory. And cocktails for two. 
Blast, he’d never be able to figure 
that one out! He watched as the 
moon played, Oh, You Beautiful 
Doll and the neon roses flashed 
slowly from red to violet, then went 
back to the closet and turned on 
the scent. The house began to smell 
like an immensely concentrated 
rose as the moon shifted to People 
Will Say We’re In Love. 

TIE rubbed his chin critically. It 
seemed all right. A dreamy 
sunset, an enchanted moon, flowers, 
scent. 

They were all purely speculat- 
ive of course. He had no idea how 
a rose really smelled — or looked 
for that matter. Not to mention a 

A FALL OF GLASS 



moon. But then, neither did the 
widow. He’d have to be confident, 
assertive. Insist on it. I tell you, my 
dear, this is a genuine realistic ro- 
mantic moon. Now, does it do any- 
thing to your pulse? Do you feel 
icy fingers marching up and down 
your spine? 

His own spine didn’t seem to be 
affected. But then he hadn’t read 
that book on ancient mores and 
courtship customs. 

How really odd the ancients 
were. Seduction seemed to be an 
incredibly long and drawn-out 
process, accompanied by a consid- 
erable amount of falsification. Com- 
munication seemed virtually im- 
possible. “No” meant any number 
of things, depending on the tone 
of voice and the circumstances. It 
could mean yes, it could mean ask 
me again later on this evening. 

He went up the stairs to the bed- 
room closet and tried the rain- 
maker, thinking roguishly: Thou 
shalt not inundate. The risks he was 
taking! A shower fell gently on the 
garden and a male chorus began to 
chant Singing in the Rain. Undi- 
minished, the yellow moon and the 
red sun continued to be brilliant, 
although the sun occasionally arced 
over and demolished several of the 
neon roses. 

The last wheel in the bedroom 
closet was a rather elegant steering 
wheel from an old 1995 Stude- 
baker. This was on the bootleg pipe; 
he gingerly turned it. 



132

Far below in the cellar there was 
a rumble and then the soft whistle 
of winds came to him. 

He went downstairs to watch out 
the living room window. This was 
important; the window had a really 
fixed attitude about air currents. 
The neon roses bent and tinkled 
against each other as the wind rose 
and the moon shook a trifle as it 
whispered Cuddle Up a Little 
Closer. 

He watched with folded arms, 
considering how he would start. My 
dear Mrs. Deshazaway. Too formal. 
They’d be looking out at the ro- 
mantic garden; time to be a bit for- 
ward. My very dear Mrs. Deshaza- 
way. No. Contrived. How about a 
simple, Dear Mrs. Deshazaway. 
That might be it. I was wondering, 
seeing as how it’s so late, if you 
wouldn’t rather stay over instead of 
going home . 

Preoccupied, he hadn’t noticed 
the winds building up, didn’t hear 
the shaking and rattling of the 
pipes. There were attic pipes con- 
nected to wall pipes and wall pipes 
connected to cellar pipes, and they 
made one gigantic skeleton that be- 
gan to rattle its bones and dance as 
high-pressure air from the dome 
blower rushed in, slowly opening 
the Studebaker valve wider and 
wider . 

The neon roses thrashed about, 
extinguishing each other. The red 
sun shot off a mass of sparks and 
then quickly sank out of sight. The 



moon fell on the garden and rolled 
ponderously along, crooning When 
the Blue of the Night Meets the 
Gold of the Day. 

The shaking house finally woke 
him up. He scrambled upstairs to 
the Studebaker wheel and shut it 
off. 

At the window again, he sighed. 
Repairs were in order. And it wasn’t 
the first time the winds got out of 
line. 

Why didn’t she marry him and 
save all this bother? He shut it all 
down and went out the front door, 
wondering about the rhyme of the 
months, about stately August and 
eccentric February and romantic 
April. April. Its days were, thirty 
and it followed September. And all 
the rest have thirty-one. What a 
strange people, the ancients! 

He still didn’t see the orange car 
parked down the street. 

W||/| EN are too perishable,” 
Mrs. Deshazaway said 
over dinner. “For all practical pur- 
poses I’m never going to marry 
again. All my husbands die.” 

“Would you pass the beets, 
please?” Humphrey Fownes said. 

She handed him a platter of 
steaming red beets. “And don’t look 
at me that way,” she said. “I’m not 
going to marry you and if you want 
reasons I’ll give you four of them. 
Andrew. Curt. Norman. And Al- 
phonse.” 

The widow was a passionate wo- 
GALAXY 



man. She did everything passion- 
ately — talking, cooking, dressing. 
Her beets were passionately red. 
Her clothes rustled and her high 
heels clicked and her jewelry tin- 
kled. She was possessed by an un- 
controllable dynamism. Fownes 
had never known anyone like her. 
“You forgot to put salt on the pota- 
toes,” she said passionately, then 
went on as calmly as it was possible 
for her to be, to explain why she 
couldn’t marry him. “Do you have 
any idea what people are saying? 
They’re all saying I’m a cannibal! 
I rob my husbands of their life force 
and when they’re empty I carry 
their bodies outside on my way to 
the justice of the peace.” 

“As long as there are people,” he 
said philosophically, “there’ll be 
talk.” 

“But it’s the air! Why don’t they 
talk about that? The air is stale, 
I’m positive. It’s not nourishing. 
The air is stale and Andrew, Curt, 
Norman and Alphonse couldn’t 
stand it. Poor Alphonse. He was 
never so healthy as on the day he 
was born. From then on things got 
steadily worse for him.” 

“I don’t seem to mind the air.” 

She threw up her hands. “You’d 
be the worst of the lot!” She left the 
table, rustling and tinkling about 
the room. “I can just hear them. Try 
some of the asparagus. Five. That’s 
what they’d say. That woman did it 
again. And the plain fact is I don’t 
want you on my record. 

A FALL OF GLASS 



“Really,” Fownes protested. “I 
feel splendid. Never better.” 

He could hear her moving about 
and then felt her hands on his 
shoulders. “And what about those 
very elaborate plans you’ve been 
making to seduce me?” 

Fownes froze with three aspara- 
gus hanging from his fork. 

“Don’t you think they’ll find out? 
I found out and you can bet they 
will. It’s my fault, I guess. I talk too 
much. And I don’t always tell the 
truth. To be completely honest with 
you, Mr. Fownes, it wasn’t the old 
customs at all standing between us, 
it was air. I can’t have another man 
die on me, it’s bad for my self- 
esteem. And now you’ve gone and 
done something good and criminal, 
something peculiar.” 

OWNES put his fork down. 

“Dear Mrs. Deshazaway,” he 
started to say. 

“And of course when they do 
find out and they ask you why, Mr. 
Fownes, you’ll tell them. No, no 
heroics, please! When they ask a 
man a question he always answers 
and you will too. You’ll tell them I 
wanted - to be courted and when 
they hear that they’ll be around to 
ask me a few questions. You see, 
we’re both a bit queer.” 

“I hadn’t thought of that,” 
Fownes said quietly. 

“Oh, it doesn’t really matter. I’ll 
join Andrew, Curt, Norman — ” 
“That won’t be necessary,” 



134 



135 



Fownes said with unusual force. 
“With all due respect to Andrew, 
Curt, Norman and Alphonse, I 
might as well state here and now I 
have other plans for you, Mrs. 
Deshazaway.” 

“But my dear Mr. Fownes,” she 
said, leaning across ' the table. 
“We’re lost, you and I.” 

“Not if we could leave the 
dome,” Fownes said quietly. 
“That’s impossible! How?” 

In no hurry, now that he had the 
widow’s complete attention, Fow- 
nes leaned across the table and 
whispered : “Fresh air, Mrs. Desha- 
zaway? Space? Miles and miles 
of space where the real-estate mon- 
opoly has no control whatever? 
Where the wind blows across prai- 
ries; or is it the other way around? 
No matter. How would you like 
that, Mrs. Deshazaway?” 

Breathing somewhat faster than 
usual, the widow rested her chin on 
her two hands. “Pray continue,” she 
said. 

“Endless vistas of moonlight and 
roses? April showers, Mrs. Deshaz- 
away. And June, which as you may 
know follows directly upon April 
and is supposed to be the month of 
brides, of marrying. June also lies 
beyond the dome.” 

“I see.” 

“And,” Mr. Fownes added, his 
voice a honeyed whisper, “they say 
that somewhere out in the space 
and the roses and the moonlight, 
the sleeping equinox yawns and 



rises because on a certain day it’s 
vernal and that’s when it roams the 
Open Country where geigers no 
longer scintillate.” 

“My.” Mrs. Deshazaway rose, 
paced slowly to the window and 
then came back to the table, stand- 
ing directly over Fownes. “If you 
can get us outside the dome,” she 
said, “out where a man stays warm 
long enough for his wife to get to 
know him ... if you can do that, Mr. 
Fownes . you may call me Agnes.” 

W HEN Humphrey Fownes 
stepped out of the widow’s 
house, there was a look of such in- 
tense abstraction on his features 
that Lanfierre felt a wistful desire 
to get out of the car and walk along 
with the man. It would be such a 
deliciously insane experience. 
(“April has thirty days,” Fownes 
mumbled, passing them, “because 
thirty is the largest number such 
that all smaller numbers not hav- 
ing a common divisor with it are 
primes.” MacBride frowned and 
added it to the dossier. Lanfierre 
sighed.) 

Pinning his hopes on the Move- 
ment, Fownes went straight to the 
library several blocks away, a shat- 
tered depressing place given over 
to government publications and 
censored old books with holes in 
them. It was used so infrequently 
that the Movement was able to 
meet there undisturbed. The libra- 
rian was a yellowed, dog-eared

woman of eighty. She spent her 
days reading ancient library cards 
and, like the books around her, had 
been rendered by time’s own cen- 
sor into near unintelligibility. 

“Here’s one,” she said to him as 
he entered. “Gulliver’s Travels. 
Loaned to John Wesley Davidson 
on March 14, 1979 for five days. 
What do you make of it?” 

In the litter of books and cards 
and dried out ink pads that sur- 
rounded the librarian, Fownes no- 
ticed a torn dust jacket with a cur- 
ious illustration. “What’s that?” he 
said. 

“A twister,” she replied quickly. 
“Now listen to this. Seven years 
later on March 2 1, 1986, Ella Mar- 
shall Davidson took out the same 
book. What do you make of that?” 

“I’d say,” Humphrey Fownes 
said, “that he . that he recom- 
mended it to her, that one day they 
met in the street and he told her 
about this book and then they . 
they went to the library together 
and she borrowed it and eventu- 
ally, why eventually they got mar- 
ried.” 

“Hah! They were brother and 
sister!” the librarian shouted in her 
parched voice, her old buckram 
eyes laughing with cunning. 

Fownes smiled weakly and look- 
ed again at the dust jacket. The 
twister was unquestionably a mete- 
orological phenomenon. It spun 
ominously, like a malevolent top, 
and coursed the countryside de- 



structively, carrying a Dorothy to 
an Oz. He couldn’t help wondering 
if twisters did anything to feminine 
pulses, if they could possibly be a 
part of a moonlit night, with cock- 
tails and roses. He absently stuffed 
the dust jacket in his pocket and 
went on into the other rooms, the 
librarian mumbling after him: “Ed- 
na Murdoch Featherstone, April 
21, 1991,” as though reading in- 
scriptions on a tombstone. 

HP HE Movement met in what 
had been the children’s room, 
where unpaid ladies of the after- 
noon had once upon a time read 
stories to other people’s offspring. 
The members sat around at the 
miniature tables looking oddly like 
giants fled from their fairy tales, 
protesting. 

“Where did the old society fail?” 
the leader was demanding of them. 
He stood in the center of the room, 
leaning on a heavy knobbed cane. 
He glanced around at the group 
almost complacently, and waited as 
Humphrey Fownes squeezed into 
an empty chair. “We live in a 
dome,” the leader said, “for lack of 
something. An invention! What is 
the one thing that the great tech- 
nological societies before ours 
could not invent, notwithstanding 
their various giant brains, electron- 
ic and otherwise?” 

Fownes was the kind of man who 
never answered a rhetorical ques- 
tion. He waited, uncomfortable in 



A FALL OF GLASS 



137 



the tight chair, while the others 
struggled with this problem in rev- 
olutionary dialectics. 

“A sound foreign policy,” the 
leader said, aware that no one else 
had obtained the insight. “If a 
sound foreign policy can’t be cre- 
ated the only alternative is not to 
have any foreign policy at all. Thus 
the movement into domes began — 
by common consent of the govern- 
ments. This is known as self-con- 
tainment.” 

Dialectically out in left field, 
Humphrey Fownes waited for a lull 
in the ensuing discussion and then 
politely inquired how it might be 
arranged for him to get out. 

“Out?” the leader said, frowning. 
“Out? Out where?” 

“Outside the dome.” 

“Oh. All in good time, my friend. 
One day we shall all pick up and 
leave.” 

“And that day I’ll await impa- 
tiently,” Fownes replied with mar- 
velous tact, “because it will be lone- 
ly out there for the two of us. My 
future wife and I have to leave 
now.” 

“Nonsense. Ridiculous! You 
have to be prepared for the Open 
Country. You can’t just up and 
leave, it would be suicide, Fownes. 
And dialectically very poor.” 

“Then you have discussed prepa- 
rations, the practical necessities of 
life in the Open Country. Food, 
clothing, a weapon perhaps? What 
else? Have I left anything out?” 



The leader sighed. “The gentle, 
man wants to know if he’s left any- 
thing out,” he said to the group. 

Fownes looked around at them, 
at some dozen pained expressions. 

“Tell the man what he’s forgot- 
ten,” the leader said, walking to 
the far window and turning his 
back quite pointedly on them. 

Everyone spoke at the same mo- 
ment. “A sound foreign policy,” 
they all said, it being almost too ob- 
vious for words. 

O N his way out the librarian 
shouted at him: “A Tale of 
a Tub, thirty-five years overdue!” 
She was calculating the fine as he 
closed the door. 

Humphrey Fownes’ preoccupa- 
tion finally came to an end when he 
was one block away from his house. 
It was then that he realized some- 
thing unusual must have occurred. 
An orange patrol car of the security 
police was parked at his front door. 
And something else was happening 
too. 

His house was dancing. 

It was disconcerting, and at the 
same time enchanting, to watch 
one’s residence frisking about on its 
foundation. It was such a strange 
sight that for the moment he didn’t 
give a thought to what might be 
causing it. But when he stepped 
gingerly onto the porch, which was 
doing its own independent gavotte, 
he reached for the doorknob with 
an immense curiosity. 



138 



GALAXY 



The door flung itself open and 
knocked him back off the porch. 

From a prone position on his 
miniscule front lawn, Fownes 
watched as his favorite easy chair 
sailed out of the living room on a 
blast of cold air and went pinwheel- 
ing down the avenue in the bright 
sunshine. A wild wind and a thick 
fog poured out of the house. It 
brought chairs, suits, small tables, 
lamps trailing their cords, ashtrays, 
sofa cushions. The house was emp- 
tying itself fiercely, as if disgorging 
an old, spoiled meal. From deep in- 
side he could hear the rumble of 
his ancient upright piano as it rolled 
ponderously from room to room. 

He stood up; a wet wind swept 
over him, whipping at his face, toy- 
ing with his hair. It was a whistling 
in his ears, and a .tingle on his 
cheeks. He got hit by a shoe. 

As he forced his way back to the 
doorway needles of rain played 
over his face and he heard a voice 
cry out from somewhere in the liv- 
ing room. 

“Help!” Lieutenant MacBride 
called. 

Standing in the doorway with his 
wet hair plastered down on his 
dripping scalp, the wind roaring 
about him, the piano rumbling in 
the distance like thunder, Humph- 
rey Fownes suddenly saw it all very 
clearly. 

“Winds,” he said in a whisper. 

“What’s happening?” MacBride 
yelled, crouching behind the sofa. 



“March winds,” he said. 
‘What?!” 

“April showers!” 

The winds roared for a moment 
and then MacBride’s lost voice 
emerged from the blackness of the 
living room. “These are not Opti- 
mum Dome Conditions!” the voice 
wailed. “The temperature is not 59 
degrees. The humidity is not 47%!” 

OWNES held his face up to let 
the rain fall on it. “Moonlight!” 
he shouted. “Roses! My soul for a 
cocktail for two!” He grasped the 
doorway to keep from being blown 
out of the house. 

“Are you going to make it stop 
or aren’t you!” MacBride yelled. 

“You’ll have to tell me what you 
did first!” 

“I told him not to touch that 
wheel! Lanfierre. He’s in the up- 
stairs bedroom!” 

When he heard this Fownes 
plunged into the house and fought 
his way up the stairs. He found 
Lanfierre standing outside the bed- 
room with a wheel in his hand. 

“What have I done?” Lanfierre 
asked in the monotone of shock. 

Fownes took the wheel. It was 
off a 1995 Studebaker. 

“I’m not sure what’s going to 
come of this,” he said to Lanfierre 
with an astonishing amount of ob- 
jectivity, “but the entire dome air 
supply is now coming through my 
bedroom.” 

The wind screamed. 



A FALL OF GLASS 



139 



“Is there something I can turn?” 
Lanfierre asked. 

“Not any more there isn’t.” 

They started down the stairs 
carefully, but the wind caught them 
and they quickly reached the bot- 
tom in a wet heap. 

Recruiting Lieutenant Mac- 
Bride from behind his sofa, the 
men carefully edged out of the 
house and forced the front door 
shut. 

The wind died. The fog disper- 
sed. They stood dripping in the 
Optimum Dome Conditions of the 
bright avenue. 

“I never figured on this,” Lan- 
fierre said, shaking his head 

With the front door closed the 
wind quickly built up inside the 
house. They could see the furnish- 
ing whirl past the windows. The 
house did a wild, elated jig. 

“What kind of a place is this?” 
MacBride said, his courage begin- 
ning to return. He took out his 
notebook but it was a soggy mess. 
He tossed it away. 

“Sure, he was different,” Lan- 
fierre murmured. “I knew that 
much.” 

When the roof blew off they 
weren’t really surprised. With a 
certain amount of equanimity they 
watched it lift off almost gracefully, 
standing on end for a moment be- 
fore toppling to the ground. It was 
strangely slow motion, as was the 
black twirling cloud that now rose 
out of the master bedroom, spew- 



ing shorts and socks and pill ow 
cases every which way. 

“Now what?” MacBride said, 
thoroughly exasperated, as this 
strange black cloud began to ac- 
celerate, whirling about like some 
malevolent top . 

T TUMPHREY Fownes took out 
the dust jacket he’d found in 
the library. He held it up and care- 
fully compared the spinning cloud 
in his bedroom with the illustratioa 
The cloud rose and spun, assuming

But Fownes had already begun 
to run on toward the next house, 
dodging mountainous puffs of glass 
as he went. “Mrs. Deshazaway!” he 
shouted. “Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Deshaza-

The dome weevils were go- 
ing berserk trying to keep up with 
the precipitation. They whirred 
back and forth at frightful speed, 
then, emptied of molten glass, 
rushed to the Trough which they 
quickly emptied and then rushed 



about empty-handed. “Yoo-hool” 
he yelled, running. The artificial 
sun vanished behind the mush- 
rooming twister. Optimum temper- 
ature collapsed. “Mrs. Deshaza- 
way! Agnes, will you marry me? 
Yoo-hoo!” 

Lanfierre and Lieutenant Mac- 
Bride leaned against their car and 
waited, dazed. 

There was quite a large fall of

tion. 

“It’s a twister,” he said softly. “A 
Kansas twister!” 

“What,” MacBride asked, his 
bravado slipping away again, “what 
... is a twister?” 

The twister roared and moved 
out of the bedroom, out over the 
rear of the house toward the side of 
the dome. “It says here,” Fownes 
shouted over the roaring, “that Dor- 
othy traveled from Kansas to Oz in 
a twister and that . and that Oz 
is a wonderful and mysterious land 
beyond the confines ot everyday 
living.” 

MacBride’s eyes and mouth 
were great zeros. 

“Is there something I can turn?” 
Lanfierre asked. 

Huge chunks of glass began to 
fall around them. 

“Fownes!” MacBride shouted. 
“This is a direct order! Make it go 
back!”

A FALL OF GLASS 



141 




RUSSIA is graduating scientists 
and engineers by the hundreds of 
thousands yearly — and the pro- 
duction of science fiction has 
class-A priority with her fiction 
factories. These are two of the 
reasons for this month’s king-size 
Junior Education Corner. 

THE MOON by George Gamow. 
Abelard-Schuman, N. Y., $2.75 

IN THE belief that it is a sure 
bet that the Moon will be the 
first extraterrestrial body to be 
visited by man, Dr. Gamow’s 
book leads off the astronomical 



section. It is a clear exposition of 
fact and theory about our satel- 
lite: its origin, composition, effects 
upon the Earth, etc. 

This revision of his 1953 book 
still retains the amusingly archaic 
excerpts from Verne’s classic 
From the Earth to the Moon in 
a chapter headed “Moon Pro- 
jectile — a Dream.” Not to end 
on this note, however, it is 
followed immediately by “Moon 
Rocket — a Reality” — which 
it is indeed. 

MEN, PLANETS AND STARS 
by Clyde B. Clason. G. P. Put- 

G ALAXY 



tiam’s Sons, N. Y., $2.95 

ALTHOUGH CLASON’S book 
is a solid technical work designed 
for junior and high school level, 
his style is far from pedantic. 

“Planetoid Icarus is named 
after a legendary Greek boy who 
flew too close to the sun with his 
wax wings. “Look, Pa. No hands!’ ” 

Despite, or perhaps because of, 
this semi-humorous approach, 
Clason establishes a rapport 
with his youthful audience that 
makes his space medicine easy to 
take. 

ROCKETS INTO SPACE by 
Alexander L. Crosby and Nancy 
Larrick. Random House, N. Y ., 
$1.95 

THE EASY-to-read series fea- 
tures simple sentences built from 
easy words. However, though 
written for the eight-to-ten-year- 
old, the plentiful and technically 
excellent illustrations appeal al- 
so to a maturer audience. In fact, 
the information apparent in the 
illustrations frequently is not 
treated in the text, so that even 
adults can look and learn from 
this rocket primer. 

DISCOVERING THE HEAV- 
ENS by I. O. Evans. Roy Pub- 
lishers, N. Y., $3.50 

THIS STUDY of astronomical 

★ ★★★★ SHELF 



history is written in a facile style 
that is exceptionally easy to take 
to mind. Evans skillfully weaves 
interesting vignettes of the 
founders of astronomy into his 
book and chronicles its laborious 
growth from superstition to its 
present eminence among the 
sciences. 

THE ROMANCE OF CHEM- 
ISTRY by Keith Gordon Irwin. 
Viking Press, N. Y., $3.75 

EARLY MAN rose from sav- 
agery by applying basic physical 
and chemical laws, but his 
understanding of these sciences 
differed greatly. Chemistry, the 
interlocking of particles impos- 
sibly small to see, had to wait 
for theory to catch up with 
practice, whereas physical phe- 
nomena were self-evident. 

Irwin’s book, entertainingly in- 
formative, highlights epochal 
moments of discovery that helped 
lift chemistry to today’s level 
of achievement. 

DISCOVERING CHEMISTRY 
by Elizabeth K. Cooper. Har- 
court, Brace 8s Co., N. Y., $3.00 

MRS. COOPER’S book is a 
splendid follow-up, to Romance, 
which whets the intellectual ap- 
petite. She provides plenty of 
experimental material for the 
neophyte, a concise work program

“serious form of fun.” 

LOUIS PASTEUR by Madeleine 
P. Grant. Whittlesey, N. Y ., $3.25 
GREGOR MENDEL by Harry 
Sootin. Vanguard Press, N. Y., 
$3.00 

ALBERT EINSTEIN by A. 
Beckhard. G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 
N. Y., $2.50 

PASTEUR AND Mendel both 
came from poor families who 
sacrificed enormously to give 
them schooling. Their battle for 
education was equally against 
hunger and privation. Moreover, 
Mendel’s only hope for a liveli- 
hood lay in joining the priest- 
hood. 

His fame rests on the results 
of an eight-year experiment with 
garden peas. Mendel, applying 
numerical method and rigid con- 
trol, discovered the mathematics 
of genetics. Unfortunately, he died 
unrecognized, his work requiring 
rediscovery. 

Pasteur, however, lived to re- 
ceive the highest honors. His 
process of sterilization saved 
breweries as well as creameries 
from ruin. Possessing enormous 
powers of concentration, he 
plunged into work that saved the 
French silk industry, and he did 
it despite the deaths of three of 
his children. His most valuable 
contribution, though, remains the 



germ theory of infection. 

Both books are inspirational 
and well integrated. 

Not so with Einstein. Working 
in a restrictive 128-page frame, 
Beckhard has cut and snipped 
Einstein’s life into a silhouette. 
This is a pity, he was decidedly 
not only “E = MCI” 

SCIENCE AND THE DOCTOR 
by F. R. Elwell and Dr. J. M. 
Richardson. Criterion Books, 
N. Y., $3.50 

MEDICINE LEFT the realm of 
magic when its practitioners be- 
gan to tie together cause and 
effect. Unfortunately, medical 
practice lost two thousand years 
to mumbo-jumbo, even though 
Hippocrates, the ancient Greek, 
set standards for observation and 
diagnosis. 

This book of thrilling discov- 
eries should channelize the social 
urge of any young do-gooder. 

WINDOW IN THE SKY by 
Homer E. Newell, Jr. McGraw- 
Hill Book Co., Inc., N. Y ., $2.75 

AS NOTED here previously, Dr. 
Newell equals his books in 
interest — he is Associate Di- 
rector in charge of Space Science 
for NASA, U.S. National Aero- 
nautics and Space Administration. 
His book brims equally with 
authority. 



The upper atmosphere is his 
special province and here he 
presents knowledge that was 
completely unsuspected until 
rocket soundings became feasible 
these last several years. 

THE CLOCK WE LIVE ON by 
Isaac Asimov. Abelard-Schuman, 
N. Y., $3.00 

DOCTOR ASIMOV again picks 
a fascinating theme — Time. He 
travels this dimension from man- 
kind’s ancient Moon and Sun 
timepieces to the present accurate 
atomic clocks that, by compari- 
son, make the heavens so reliable 
that the costliest timepieces are 
as a Mickey Mouse watch. 

THE STORY OF EARTH 
SCIENCE by Horace G. Rich- 
ards. J. B. Lippincott Co., Phila., 
$ 3.75 

FOSSILS, ROCKS and minerals, 
in that order, attract the interest 
of laymen or prospective students 
of Earth science, Richards avers, 
and his book is planned accord- 
ingly. It abounds with information 
for the neophyte archeologist — 
from tips on sites for excavation 
and research to specific informa- 
tion on identification of the afore- 
mentioned three categories. 

MEN AND WOMEN BEHIND 
THE ATOM by Sarah U. Ried- 

*★★★★ SHELF 



man. Abelard-Schuman, N. Y., 
$3.00 

MANKIND’S ENTRY into the 
Atomic Age was assisted by 
numerous midwives. An enor- 
mous amount of information has 
been distilled into laudably 
compact, digestible form; no 
small feat when dealing with the 
contributions of such as the 
Curies, Einstein, Rutherford and 
— contemporary giants. 

BLASTOFF AT 0300 by Hugh 
Walters. Criterion Books, N. Y., 
$3.50 

A QUEER alteration in the out- 
line of the Moon mountain, Pico, 
causes Britain to hurry its space 
program in the fear that Russia 
may already have a base there. 
A young Cambridge student, 
short enough to fit a hastily 
redesigned research rocket, is 
selected for a preliminary 
hundred-mile photo-survey jump 
into space. 

The book, a vivid fictional ac- 
count of the training program 
necessary for such a venture, 
includes plenty of action and 
international intrigue. Plausible 
and detailed, it is a juvenile 
Prelude to Space.

Robert A. Heinlein. G. P. Put- 
nam’s Sons, N. Y. $3.95 

IN “TROOPERS,” Heinlein has 
penned a juvenile that really is 
not. This is a new and bitter and 
disillusioned Heinlein. 

His story opens with flaming 
action and then acquaints the 
reader, via flashbacks, with his 
hero, set on acquiring a citizen’s 
franchise and voting rights by 
serving in the armed forces. 

From boot camp into combat, 
from OCS to command, Heinlein’s 
story is well told, crammed with 
political theory, and of excep- 
tional interest to veterans with 
battle experience . but young- 
sters will find it melancholy and 
verbose. Thus my split rating.

When discovered and smashed 
by an archeological expedition, 
other solar traps are planted on

—FLOYD C. GALE 



for the first time anywhere, here is a description of the greatest 



exhibit in the monumental Bernard Baroque Museum on Sigma 

Corvi IV. 




By EDWARD WELLEN 

I T IS OWING to Timothy 
Root, a cambist of Sol III, 
that we have priceless speci- 
mens of mediums of exchange 
that the Universal Credit Card 
has rendered obsolete. In his 
dealings in alien monies, Timothy 
Root from time to time came 
across choice specimens, ex- 
tracted them, attached them end 
to end, and in 2137 U.E. left to 
the Bernard Baroque Museum in 



Sigma Corvi IV the renowned 
Galactic “Short-Snorter.” 

This is not simply a souvenir of 
his calling, and of the trading and 
traveling it called for, but, be- 
cause of his practice of writing 
on the margins of each bill as 
he acquired it some account of 
the society in which it functioned, 
a veritable compendium of the 
history of economics. 

Indeed, to appreciate to the 
full these more or less worn 
catalysts, one must view them 



GALAXY 



ORIGINS OF THE GALACTIC SHORT-SNORTER 147 



146 



not only as bits of various ma- 
terials of various sizes, shapes, 
and colors, but as bits of history. 

Needless to say, we do not 
always agree with Timothy 
Root’s evaluations — in fact, we 
discount many, many of them. 
But it is as a trail-blazer that we 
honor him. 

Inasmuch as the Short-Snorter 
winds and coils in and out of 
three large rooms of the Museum, 
we can give only a sampling of 
its riches here. 

T HERE is no better item to 
begin with than (a) in the 
exhibit. This is at once the largest 
and smallest piece of currency, 
compensating in size for its mi- 
nuscule denomination. It is a 
1/10 w -fuddo bill and was in use 
on Megrez I for paying taxes. In 
2020 U.E. the government there 
began taxing a person on what 
he valued himself. Psychiatrists 
from all over the Galaxy flocked 
there, and the natives flocked to 
the psychiatrists — to achieve 
feelings of inadequacy. The 
government made out fairly well 
on the take from the psychiatrists 
till the psychiatrists took to going 
to one another. 

The Sterope IV trader who 
passed on to Timothy Root the 
next item (b) himself received 
it as a reward for supplying the 
authorities misleading informa- 
tion. A guilt-filled Steropean had 



yielded himself up for the killing 
of a leading citizen. To substanti- 
ate his confession, he furnished 
details only the killer could 
know. One detail he was unaware 
of — the state had just emptied 
the state treasury to build a new 
Treasury Building. Knowing a 
murder trial would cost the state 
over 1,000,000 lemuc, it had 
given secret strict instructions to 
prevent a trial. The trader, a 
brother-in-law of the police com- 
missioner (and, incidentally, a 
sub-son-in-law of the builder), 
came forward and to the great 
relief of the state furnished the 
self-styled killer with an alibi. 

(c) This charred banknote is 
a relic of El Kophrah III. Tim- 
othy Root came across it, with 
“nervous belly,” in his words, 
poking through rubble. The 
planet was in ruins. But the 
scattering of starving survivors 
had one remnant of pride. They 
had, before the attack by El 
Kophrah V, succeeded, by cut- 
ting defense-research spending, 
in balancing the budget. 

(d) A reserve note from 
Alcyone II. This is little more 
than play money for second 
childhood. One result of longer 
life-expectancy was the postpon- 
ing of inheritance till the heirs 
were themselves rich in years, 
and, because of welfare benefits, 
in no need of such windfalls, 
which soon became a mere matter 



148 



GALAXY 



of form. This kind of note came 
mostly into play in the buying 
and selling of pasts — contracts 
for the purchase or sale of 
produce raised, harvested, de- 
livered and eaten years before. 

A ND THIS leads us to another 
■^example (e) of non-monetary 
money, the scrip of Maia V. This 
is not currency per se but a 
symbol of a product that the 
currency would have bought. 
This particular civilization was 
attempting to move from material 
gain to the purely spiritual. For 
the benefit of those of its citizens 
who were still in the intermediate 
stages, the government printed 
scrip bearing the names of cov- 
eted objects and distributed them 
free, in lieu of the objects them- 
selves. In accord with its policy 
of gradually eliminating the main 
physical stumbling block, the 
money mart, the government 
each year took away another 
exchange seat. The members had 
to compete physically for the re- 
maining seats. The narrowing 
group of survivors, striving to 
stay in condition to maintain 
their sitting, grew more and more 
fiercely engrossed with the wholly 
physical. The last two felt their 
joint strength was enough to en- 
able them to turn the tables on 
the government. It was. They 
pensioned off the deposed leaders 
with scrip bearing titles of power. 



(f) A non-negotiable instru- 
ment from Talitha IX. A suave, 
persuasive missionary to that 
planet, hoping a wealthy elderly 
native lady would endow his mis- 
sion, sold her on the transmigra- 
tion of souls. With unremitting 
hatred, he listened to the reading 
of her will. She had left all her 
money and effects to herself. Her 
estate has remained intact, as 
the executors have so far been 
unable to determine which if 
any of the life-forms of Talitha 
IX she has come back as. 

(g) This is a replica; the 
original note vanished in a 
frightening puff shortly after the 
transaction in which Timothy 
Root obtained it. The Electra 
VII government designed its 
money to encourage spending 
and discourage hoarding. The 
note bore a printed circuit and 
a timing device that set off the 
note at some indeterminate mo- 
ment within six Terran .months 
of issue. Whoever had possession 
of the note at the time was left 
with a hole burned in his pocket. 

(h) The opposite extreme — 
a bill that is practically inde- 
structible. It was in this currency 
that the government of Alcor III 
paid off migrant workers who 
had erected a dome on a new 
satellite. This payoff resulted in 
the workers blasting the dome to 
shards — not out of eagerness 
for more work in rebuilding the 



ORIGINS OF THE GALACTIC SHORT-SNORTER 149 



dome, but out of resentment. 
They had worked to get the 
money in order to sacrifice it as 
a burnt offering of the fruit of 
their labors. Alcor III made a 
hasty deal for the fulminating 
Electra VII money and the mi- 
grant workers rebuilt the dome. 
The money went off just before 
the dome was finished and they 
blew it up again. 

(i) A banknote from Alde- 
baran I. The luminosity of the 
money rubs off; the richer the 
person, the more he glowed. Na- 
turally, to preserve this distinc- 
tion of status, the government 
had to lay down restrictions on 
the passing of notes. For example, 
tellers and clerks were not al- 
lowed to handle money. 

TT’ROM Merope I comes exhibit 
-*■ (j). As automation and spe- 
cialization more and more re- 
moved the sense of actually 



having to do with production, 
people of this planet grew more 
and more uneasy. They found it 
hard to justify their economic 
upkeep. 

To give people the feeling that 
they were really earning the 
money, the government turned 
out its notes in the form of a 
jigsaw puzzle. One had to piece 
it together before it could be 
banked or spent. 

This worked for a time, but 
the notes had to become increas- 
ingly difficult to assemble, to 
make an acceptable work week. 
This specimen is one of the last 
notes issued. A piece is missing. 
This is not owing to any slip-up 
on the part of Timothy Root. It 
was a deliberate omission, a 
shameful, debasing device of the 
government’s to put off the final 
reckoning, which came a week 
later.

No doubt of it, success 
calls tor a salute — 
but a one-gun salute? 



By GORDON R. DICKSON 

Illustrated by Burns 



T HE mists of precondition- 
ing rolled away. Harold 
Smith-Jones came back to 
himself on the hospital-like metal 
table of the Technical Center. 
They were just cranking the hood 
up off him. 

“There you go,” said one of 
the white-coated technicians, giv- 
ing him a hand up. Off the table 
and once more on his feet, 
Harold frowned at the young- 
ster. 



“ — sir!” he corrected. 

“There you go, sir,” the tech- 
nician made haste to amend. 

Harold’s frown relaxed. He 
did not approve of this modern 
laxity — but they were good 
boys. He did not approve of 
riding subordinates, either. 

He allowed himself to be 
helped on with his regency coat. 
A tall, blond young boy was 
standing back from the group a 
bit, waiting. His new decoy, no

doubt. A good type, in jumper 
and slacks, athletic, his only 
adornment the thin, sharp-edged 
strip of polished steel that held 
the watch on his wrist. The boy 
was somewhat tight-faced and 
looked nervous. 

“Cheer up, there!” said Harold, 
giving him a friendly whack on 
the back. “All in the day’s work.” 

The decoy managed a grin. A 
trifle sick — but a grin. Good 
lad, thought Harold, and, leaving 
the room, headed out for the job. 

As he stepped, a moment later, 
out of the gray building’s austere 
entrance, the brilliant September 
sunlight struck him a sudden, 
dazzling blow, and for a moment 
the street before him wavered 
and blurred. 

“Steady on, now — ” he 
thought, catching hold of the left 
arch of the entrance. He felt the 
gray stone rough under his palms, 
took a deep breath, and the 
street steadied and came back in 
focus. 

The preconditioning again, of 
course, he told himself. It must 
be he had developed a sensitivity 
to the hypnotic drug they used 
to put him in a receptive state 
for instructions. Slight allergic 
reaction on his part, possibly. He 
made a mental note to mention 
the fact in his report later. 

There was no point in his 
being uncomfortable. On the 
other hand, it would hardly do 



to take on a job without the 
protection of full precondition- 
ing. Under the latest laws dealing 
with this sort of thing, the 
opposition had the right to ques- 
tion him if they happened to get 
their hands on him before he 
reached the street afterward. 
Only if he showed obvious evi- 
dence of preconditioning, so that 
he could tell them nothing of 
how he had planned the job, 
would there be no point in their 
doing so. And such questioning 
could be — well, there was no 
point in dwelling on unpleasant 
details. 

Not that anything would go 
wrong. Not with a job he himself 
had researched and planned. Not 
with a possible new world’s record 
staring him in the face. 

Thirty-four consecutives. Thir- 
ty-four! Without a hitch, or a 
scratch upon him. He would take 
a little vacation after this one, 
thought Harold. Rest on his 
laurels. 

He took another deep breath 
and stepped hard on his left foot. 
The outline of the small plastic 
gun could be felt through the 
inner sole, and at the feel of it the 
old magic flooded through him 
once again, like a spate of warm 
wine. Ah, he thought, never mind 
fame and riches, never mind 
palaces and beautiful women. 
Give me a gun. 

With confidence and even good

humor returned, he got down 
onto the nearest strip of the 
moving sidewalk before him and 
let it carry him off. 

The sidewalk slid him off 
down the block and swept around 
a corner. As he came around the 
curve, he caught sight of his own 
dark image, obscurely reflected 
in a passing store display window. 
Perfect, perfect! 

A HEAVY-BODIED, somewhat 
■**- small man in regency coat, 
breeches and jackboots — with 
• lilies of the valley in the little 
vases at each ankle. Thank God 
nowadays everybody dressed the 
way they wished. When he had 
been a boy, back in the nineteen- 
sixties, everybody he remembered 
had dressed alike. But now, with 
the overpopulation pressures, no- 
body cared much whether the in- 
dividual lived or died, let alone 
how he dressed. A damned, dull 
time, the past, no matter what 
the historical entertainments 
liked to pretend. He preferred the 
present. 

Of course, for business reasons, 
mainly. With any costume per- 
missible, it was that much easier 
to create the image of a harmless, 
pompous, little fat man. 

On the other hand, thought 
Harold, his feet changing slide- 
ways without consulting his 
brain, maybe his liking for the 
present was based on the fact he 

THE HOURS ARE GOOD 



was in a special situation. Few 
people had his opportunities for 
what you might call excitement 
and adventure. After all, he re- 
minded himself, he had originally 
intended to be a wine-taster, 
having that wonderful discrim- 
ination of taste that is born in 
one person in a million. If it 
hadn’t been for that little psy- 
chotic upset (but everyone had 
them these days) he might not 
have lost it, and never gone into 
this business at all. And never 
discovered what an aptitude he 
had for it. Ah, yes — “Some are 
born great. Some have greatness 
thrust upon them . 

On the other hand . Harold 
found himself glancing at a street 
sign, and changed to another 
moving sidewalk with the auto- 
mated reaction of good precondi- 
tioning. On the other hand, 
aptitude itself was really only the 
cornerstone of his success. Study, 
study — plan, plan — practice, 
practice — that was the real 
secret; that and his attention to 
details like seldom using the 
same decoy more than twice, and 
little touches like the lilies of the 
valley on his boots. And the 
man in the street thought all it 
took was a good target eye and 
a touch of sadism. 

Harold stepped off the side- 
walk into an entrance blazoned 
above with the legend mother 
turner’s tea rooms. Marvelous,

thought Harold, the way the pre- 
conditioning had brought him 
right to the place when every jot 
of knowledge about the job had 
been hidden from his mind by 
the hypnotic block. He’d had no 
idea where he was heading until 
the moment of recognition right 
now. The boys in the technical 
department deserved a com- 
mendation in his report. And 
would get it. 

Entering, he nodded to himself. 
One of the decently exclusive 
gathering places. Wisely, these 
places kept their prices up and 
excluded the salaried mob, who 
never ceased to be baffled by the 
fact that the Tea Rooms offered 
no better drinks or accommoda- 
tions than their own cocktail 
lounges. They missed the point 
entirely. 

Harold passed on into a dim-lit 
foyer. Two men converged on him 
immediately. 

“Mind stepping on this metal 
plate, sir?” — hum of detectors. 

“Excuse me, sir.” — hands pat- 
ting him swiftly all over. 

“Not at all, boys. I know you’ve 
got a job to do.” Harold’s voice 
rang heartily; a generous man, a 
jolly, fat man with an untroubled 
conscience. With a cheerful wave 
of his hand, he turned to the 
right. There, before an arched in- 
terior entrance, was a placard. 

WILLIAM X. KLANNERT 
Editorial Auction 



rpHAT’S right — the little 
nodule of pre-planted infor- 
mation said in Harold’s head, re- 
leasing its interior surprise of 
information. Klannert was the 
author of that best-selling new 
philosophical novel, Existence? s 
Worth; and this was one of 
those publicity affairs promoted 
by his publishers under the guise 
of auctioning off a subsidiary 
right or two. Really, just a good 
public relations excuse to intro- 
duce Klannert to magazine edi- 
tors, TV and film people, etc. He 
himself, Harold pre-remembered 
suddenly, was supposed to edit 
one of the intellectual weeklies 
under the name of Spence. 

“Oh, Mr. Spence! Here you 
are! Martini?” 

Harold became suddenly 
aware of a seductive blonde in 
flame-purple, standing just inside 
the entrance to the placarded 
room and tempting him in with 
a full cocktail glass. A hostess, 
of course — preconditioned to 
recognize all those to whom in- 
vitations had been distributed. 
Harold himself (or the technical 
boys) had been thorough with 
this detail, too. Harold went gra- 
ciously toward her. 

“Why, thanks, no,” he said. “I 
never drink.” True enough. Did 
the gunmen of the old West — 
the good ones, that is — drink 
while awaiting their moment of 



154 



GALAXY 






truth? And how much more 
foolish for Harold. “Iced tea, 
perhaps.” 

“Of course, Mr. Spence. Of 
course!” 

She swept off to get him one. 
He glanced about the room. 
There, that was Klannert over 
there — the peaceful-faced, 
silver-haired man seated on the 
little dais at the end of the oval 
room, a crowd clustered around 
him. 

“Your iced tea, Mr. Spence.” 

“Thank you, ma’mselle. 
Cheers!” 

“Oh, cheerio, Mr. Spence!” 

He continued on into the 
room, glass in hand, caught up 
immediately in the good-sized 
crowd. 

“Oops, terribly sorry — ” He 
had collided with a small brun- 



ette. 

“My fault, really. Say, I don’t 
know you, do I? I’m Hepzibah 
Collins. Wasteland.” 

“Aneas Spence. The Fabliau 
Weekly.” 

“You must give me your biog 
and I’ll have it preconditioned 
into me the next time at the 
office. I do feel it’s everybody’s 
duty to know everyone they 
meet, don’t you?” 

“Absolutely.” Harold fumbled 
artistically in a huge pocket of 
his regency coat. “I don’t seem 
to have a biog slip with me — ” 
“Oh, dear. Well, tape it to me. 



THE HOURS ARE GOOD 

K 



There’s Samantha! Sam!” 

She disappeared into the 
crowd. Moving off himself, 
Harold came on to a small empty 
balcony and stepped up on it for 
a look at the crowd. 

The number of people he saw 
rang a sudden icy tocsin of warn- 
ing in his mind. There were at 
least twenty or thirty more here 
than his formal estimate of at- 
tendance had calculated. In a 
small room with a single exit, 
such a mob could hamper 
escape; and he would not legally 
be free from capture or reprisal 
until he was actually out of the 
building. 

Harold carefully set down his 
glass of iced tea and took another 
deep breath, putting his weight 
once more on his left foot to feel 
the solid shape of the gun. The 
situation at once became clearer. 
He congratulated himself on his 
early study of Yoga. Like every 
other bit of knowledge he had 
painstakingly acquired, it paid 
off a thousandfold at times. 

I^OW THAT he thought of it 
■*- ’ more objectively, the crowd 
might not hamper him. It might 
even help him by interfering 
with pursuit. Harold smiled. Once 
again his wisdom in leaving the 
final situation fluid and adaptable 
was proving itself. 

He turned his attention to the 
business of spotting Klannert’s 



155 



bodyguards. Klannert would be 
expecting someone to try to do a 
job on him sooner or later. Every- 
one in the public eye knew such 
things were inevitable. Harold let 
his gaze search the crowd. That 
girl — Hepzibah Collins, the 
Wasteland editor — was one, of 
course. An expert frisker, un- 
doubtedly; her collision with him 
would have been for the purpose 
of doubling-checking the detec- 
tives’ search. Odd existence, 
thought Harold, momentarily 
struck by that strange, sad, 
philosophical turn of mind that 
had been growing on him these 
last few years. Imagine making a 
living going through life bump- 
ing up against people! Still, some 
sorts of persons might actually 
enjoy it. 

The hostess was undoubtedly 
another. 

And then that tall, heavy sen- 
atorial type. An excellent actor, 
but Harold had not studied over 
fifty thousand job reports in the 
past fifteen years for nothing. 
This man had been a bodyguard 
in the Claire Dumont job in 
April ’89. 

Then there was — good lord, 
whom did they expect to fool 
with that? That beetle-browed 
plug-ugly who was supposed, no 
doubt, to look so much like a 
bodyguard that nobody could 
suspect he would be one. And 
that was the lot — no, wait. That 



small old lady over there. She 
looked perfectly innocent; but 
the minute Harold’s eyes noted 
the way she held her silver mesh 
purse, he knew. Those hands had 
had judo and karate training. 

Harold paused, out of thor- 
oughness, to take one last survey 
of the crowd. But there were no 
more opposition people to be un- 
covered. If there had been, he 
would have known who they 
were, even if his conscious gaze 
could find no flaw in them. Sixth 
sense, in his case, so many people 
in the Organization said. Noth- 
ing of the sort! It was the result 
of long years of study so intense 
that few minds could have stood 
up under it. 

But it was time for that decoy 
of his to be here. Harold turned 
toward the entrance and spotted 
the slacks-and-jumper outfit. 
Then he stiffened slightly. The 
young fool! 

His decoy had brought a good- 
looking redheaded girl along as 
part of his camouflage. What was 
the matter with the boy? Had he 
been asleep during Harold’s 
lectures to the apprentice classes? 
A decoy’s job was to draw the 
attention of the bodyguards 
gradually upon himself. Any 
woman could either attract too 
much attention or else sidetrack 
it unduly. With this woman — 
well, it was damned lucky that 
Harold’s timetable had not called 



156 



GALAXY 



for elaborate pre-action pro- 
ceedings. 

For the boy’s own good, Harold 
should censure him in his report. 
But on the other hand, he thought, 
softening, why make an official 
matter of it? Teach the lad a 
lesson instead — Harold smiled 
slightly to himself — by taking 
that good-looking redhead away 
from him afterward. Harold sel- 
dom went out of his way now 
for female companionship, but 
it was an accepted fact that no 
woman could resist a successful 
professional in his line of work. 
And it would drive home to the 
boy that lessons were to be 
learned. Possibly save his life as 
well, someday. 

It was time to begin work. 



TTAROLD left the little balcony 
and went down into the 
crowd. The cocktails, he noticed, 
had been flowing freely and the 
people were already beginning to 
clump in little gossipy or argu- 
mentative groups. He wandered 
around a while and then joined 
one about halfway between the 
balcony and the dais where 
Klannert still sat. 

“ — Nobel Prize,” a short, bel- 
ligerent, broad-shouldered, mid- 
dle-aged man was saying. He 
had a bushy, black, ill-trimmed 
spade beard which he was 
thrusting at all his hearers. 



“Deserved every cent of it! What? 
Man is more than merely a sus- 
taining mechanism! No one like 
Klannert!” 

“Come now,” said Harold, 
smoothly intruding. “Mechanism, 
after all, is an accepted socio- 
logical theory. All of us like to 
see it questioned, for form’s 
sake, if nothing else. But to 
throw it out completely — ” 

“Who’re you?” said the 
bearded man. 

“Spence. Fabliau Weekly.” 

“I know your rag!” said the 
bearded man. “Didn’t think you’d 
have the nerve to stick your nose 
in here!” 

Smiling — for the Fabliau 
was wholly imaginary — Harold 
bent his head politely. 

“I think my lead article in the 
issue before last answers your 
arguments,” he said. 

“Lies, lies, lies — ” sputtered 
the bearded man. But Harold 
was already on his way to another 
group one step nearer to Klan- 
nert. 

He paused with this group — 
they were also singing Klannert’s 
praises, but Harold refused to let 
himself be drawn into conversa- 
tion this time. He had already 
made the point — for anyone 
who happened to be taking an 
unduly suspicious interest in 
him — that he was not trying to 
make himself unobtrusive by hid- 
ing his own point of view. In

GALAXY 



fact, he had avoided drawing 
nusual attention to himself by 
drawing a small amount of the 
usual sort of attention to himself. 
At the second group he listened 
a while, smiled noncommittally 
nd moved on. 

That feeling, almost of sad- 
ness, slipped over him again as 
he continued to circle about the 
room. 

It was all so simple, if you 
knew what you were doing. 

xperience taught you what the 
opposition would expect. You 
gave them something else. It was 
as easy as that. So simple it was 
almost a little pitiful. 

Look at Klannert up there. A 
good man, by the standards of 
those who considered themselves 
good men. But he had offended 
somebody or other. Who, of 
course, would never be known; 
the Organization was strict about 
protecting clients. But somewhere, 
somebody had signed the neces- 
sary credit chit — and here was 
Harold, about to put a period to 
the life that had been considered 
good. 

And for what? Not really 
for the money. A little for the 
excitement of the business. Pos- 
sibly a little more because this 
would make a new world’s 
record. But really because that 
was the way the world wagged 
these days — for himself, for 
Klannert, for everybody. 



VW/'E ARE ALL bound by the 
** wheel of life, thought Harold, 
with a touch of soft melancholy. 
All to the same wheel. After 
this, he would take a vacation, 
get away for a long rest to 
some place where he could be 
a common man once more among 
men. It was time, and overtime, 
for a change. 

He stopped. He had worked 
his way clear across the room on 
a slant. He stood now by some 
egg-yellow wall draperies, not 
fifteen feet from where Klannert 
sat. Elsewhere about the room, 
the people were all huddled in 
small, busily talking groups. 
There was space to run between 
the groups. Now. Once excite- 
ment had struck, they would mill 
around, getting in each other’s 
way and in the way of pursuit. 
But by that time, he should be 
in the foyer, if not out into the 
safety of the public street. 

He looked for his decoy. 
There the boy was, still with the 
girl, standing out among the 
less attractive mortals grouped 
around Klannert, very satisfac- 
torily. The hostess, Harold noted 
with satisfaction, was standing 
with apparent casualness quite 
close to them. 

Harold smiled entirely to him- 
self, internally, with that same 
touch of melancholy. He glanced 
around without seeming to. His 
glass of iced tea was almost

finished. He drained the last few 
drops from it; and as he did, it 
slipped from his fingers. 

It dropped with a soft thump 
to the thick carpet, rolling half 
out of sight under the draperies. 
Exclaiming in annoyance, he bent 
over as if to pick it up. 

Instead, without any undue at- 
tempt at concealment, his hand 
went to the toe of his left boot. 
Toe and hand lifted together, the 
top part of the boot and bootsole 
peeled away from the bottom 
half, and the plastic gun slipped 
out into his fingers. He straight- 
ened up — 

— and something tremen- 
dously heavy crashed down on 
him from behind. He was aware 
of himself suddenly, on his knees 
and going down further, with the 
full weight of another adult on 
his back. His head was foggy. He 
could still see and hear, but 
everything had a dreamlike 
quality about it. He felt the 
thick, deep carpet pressing up 
against the palms of his hands 
as he flung them out to break 
his fall. He had a sudden 
kaleidoscopic glimpse of nearby 
faces turning to stare in his di- 
rection. And then, thin and clear, 
above the sound of voices still 
talking, he heard a woman 
scream. 

The weight on his back rolled 
suddenly off. Turning his head, 
Harold saw that his assailant had 



been the belligerent, . spade- 
bearded man who had been 
holding forth to the first group 
of talkers. The man was now 
scrambling to his feet and launch- 
ing himself in the direction of 
the room’s entrance. For a second 
the crowd opened out a little, 
and Harold had a sudden glimpse 
of his decoy, bare-wristed, run- 
ning for the entrance, while the 
girl with him stopped and half 
turned, lifting a gun with cool 
expertness and sending several 
shots into the spade-bearded man. 

Scrambling to his own feet as 
the spade-bearded man went 
down, Harold caught sight of 
Klannert stumbling down from 
the dais. His hands were up at 
his chest; and sticking out from 
between two fingers was a thin 
strip of metal, a strip of steel 
about the width of a wristwatch 
band. As Harold watched, Klan- 
nert’s knees gave way and he 
sank down below the bodies of 
the people who were rushing 
toward him. 

H AROLD grabbed at his fallen 
gun — but in that second, 
hard hands seized him and 
hustled him through the crowd. 
Twisting his head back over his 
shoulder, he saw he was in the 
grasp of one of the detective- 
bodyguards and an unidentified 
stranger. They impelled him 
swiftly into the lobby. 

GALAXY 






i “They’ll shoot me now — ” 
Ithought Harold, his heart yam- 
mering at his throat. Then, like 
the thudding of some huge, 
sickening velvet hammer, despair 
came to shatter his panic. What 
did it matter? Caught on the job 
— a failure — execution left to 
a decoy. Or had he been double- 
crossed? 

[ He became aware that those 
holding him had stopped, and 
the detective had stepped across 
the room, leaving Harold pinned 
by the stranger in an efficient 
judo hold. Harold could not turn 
his head to see, or make out the 
words of the conversation. Sud- 
denly they were interrupted by 
an ugly laugh from the detective. 
Heavy footsteps returned behind 
him. 

[ He was grabbed and rushed 
forward to the open entrance — 
hurled roughly out into the 
street. 

Harold staggered, windmilling 
for balance on the slideway out- 
side. Laughter echoed behind 
him. He whirled, wild with rage. 
The gun was still clutched in his 
hand. They had forgotten it. He 
jerked it up before him — 

— and, abruptly, the mists of 
preconditioning vanished from 
his brain. They left him with the 
suddenness of support jerked 



away. He stared at the entrance 
to Mother Turner’s Tea Rooms, 
and then at the gun down in his 
hand. He began to weep. 

Quite a crowd had accumulated 
about him. A city policeman 
came pushing through it, to 
stand before Harold, red-faced 
and sweating. 

“All right, all right! Move on!” 
he shouted. The crowd started to 
drift away. He turned on Harold. 
“What’re you doing with that in 
your hand? Don’t you know it’s 
illegal? Where’s your license?” 

Harold shook his head, unable 
to speak. The policeman snatched 
the gun from him and turned it 
over in two freckled hands. His 
expression faded from anger to 
exasperation. He shoved the gun 
back into Harold’s hands and 
turned away. 

“Get off the street,” he said to 
Harold, and then, to those of the 
crowd that still lingered, “All 
right, all right — move along! 
The gun’s a fake. He’s only a 
decoy, just snapped out of con- 
ditioning. Nothing more to see. 
Move along now!” He shoved 
Harold impersonally. “You too.” 

Harold moved off, weeping, 
clutching the imitation gun in his 
hand, the salt tears streaming 
down his face.

D 



R. CLARENCE PEC- 
CARY was an objective 
man. His increasing irri- 
tation was caused, he realized, by 
the fear that his conscience was 
going to intervene between him 
and the vast fortune that was 
definitely within his grasp. Mil- 
lions. Billions! But he wanted to 
enjoy it. 

He didn’t want to skulk through 
life avoiding the eyes of everyone 
he met — particularly when his 
life might last for centuries. So 
he sat glowering at the rectangu- 
lar screen that was located just 
above the CQntrol console of 
Roger Staghorn’s great digital 
computer. 

At the moment Peccary was 
ready to accuse Staghorn of hav- 
ing no conscience whatsoever. It 
was only through an act of scien- 
tific detachment that he reminded 
himself that Staghorn neither had 
a fortune to gain nor cared about 
gaining one. Staghorn’s fulfillment 
was in Humanac, the name he’d 
given the electronic monster that 
presently claimed his full atten- 
tion. He sat at the controls, his 

163 




eyes luminous behind the mag- 
nification of his thick lenses, his 
lanky frame arched forward for 
a better view of Humanac’s 
screen. Far from showing annoy- 
ance at what he saw, there was 
a positive leer on his face. 

As well there might be. 

On the screen was the full color 
picture of a small park in what 
appeared to be the center of a 
medium-sized town. It was a 
shabby little park. Rags and tat- 
tered papers waggled indolently 
in the breeze. The grass was an 
unkempt, indifferent pattern of 
greens and browns, as though the 
caretaker took small pains in set- 
ting his sprinklers. Beyond the 
square was a church, its steeple 
listing dangerously, its windows 
broken and its heavy double doors 
sagging on their hinges. 

Staghorn’s leers and Dr. Pec- 
cary’s glowers were not for the 
scenery, however, but for the peo- 
ple who wandered aimlessly 
through the little park and along 
the street beyond, carefully avoid- 
ing the area beneath the leaning 
steeple. All of them were uni- 
formly young, ranging from per- 
haps seventeen at one extreme to 
no more than thirty at the other. 
When Dr. Peccary had first seen 
them, he’d cried out joyfully, “You 
see, Staghorn, all young! All 
handsome!” Then he’d stopped 
talking as he studied those in the 
foreground more closely. 



Their clothing, to call it that, 
was most peculiar. It was rags. 

Here and there was a garment 
that bore a resemblance to a dress 
or jacket or pair of trousers, but 
for the most part the people sim- 
ply had chunks of cloth wrapped 
about them in a most careless 
fashion. Several would have been 
arrested for indecent exposure 
had they appeared anywhere ex- 
cept on Humanac’s screen. How- 
ever, they seemed indifferent to 
this — and to all else. A singu- 
larly attractive girl,, in a costume 
that would have made a Cretan 
blush, didn’t even get a second 
glance from, a young Adonis who 
passed her on the walk. Nor did 
she bestow one on him. The park 
bench held more interest for her, 
so she sat down on it. 

Peccary studied her more close- 
ly, then straightened with a start. 

4 4 I’LL be damned,” he said. 

“That’s Jenny Cheever!” 
Staghorn continued to leer at 
the girl. “So you know her?” 

“I know her father. He owns 
the local variety store. She’s only 
twenty today, and there she is a 
hundred years from now, not a 
day older.” 

“Only her image, Dr. Peccary,” 
Staghorn murmured. “Only her 
image. But a very pretty one.” 
Peccary came to his feet, un- 
able to control his irritation any 
longer. “I won’t believe it!” he 
GALAXY 



164 



said. Somehow a piece of misin- 
formation has been fed into that 
machine. Its calculations are all 
wrong!” 

Staghorn refused to be per- 
turbed. “But you just said you rec- 
ognize the girl on the bench. I’d 
say that Humanac has to be work- 
ing with needle-point accuracy to 
put recognizable people into a 
prediction.” 

“Then shift the scene! For all I 

i know this part of town was turned 
into an insane asylum fifty years 
from now.” The use of the past 
tense when speaking of a future 
event was not ungrammatical in 
the presence of Humanac. “Do 
you have the volume up?” 

“Certainly. Can’t you hear the 
birds twittering?” 

“But I can’t hear anyone talk- 
ing.” 



“Perhaps it’s a day of silence.” 
Staghorn took another long look 
at the girl on the parkbench and 
then turned to the controls, us- 
ing the fine adjustment on the 
geographical locator. The screen 
flickered, blinked, and the scene 
changed. The two men studied it. 
“Recognize it?” said Staghorn. 
Peccary gave an affirmative 
grunt. “That’s the Jefferson gram- 
mar school on Elm Street. I’m 
surprised it’s still there. But, lord, 
as long as they haven’t built a new 
one, you’d think they’d at least 
keep the old one repaired.” 
“Very shabby,” Staghorn agreed. 



THE I MMORTALS 



It was. Large areas of the ex- 
terior plaster had fallen away. 
Windows were shattered, and here 
and there the broken slats of 
Venetian blinds stuck through 
them. The shrubbery around the 
building was dead; weeds had 
sprung up through the cracks in 
the asphalt in the big play yard. 
There was no sign of children. 

“Where is everyone?” Peccary 
demanded. “You must have the 
time control set for a Sunday or 
holiday.” 

“It’s Tuesday,” Staghorn said. 
Then both were silent because at 
that moment a child appeared, a 
boy of about eleven. 

IX E burst from the schoolhouse 
door and ran across the 
cracked asphalt toward the play- 
ground, glancing back over his 
shoulder as though expecting pur- 
suit. Reaching the play apparatus 
he paused and looked around des- 
perately. The metal standards for 
the swings were in place but no 
swings hung from them. The ful- 
crums for the seesaws were there 
but they held no wooden planks 
to permit teetering. The only 
piece of equipment that looked 
capable of affording pleasure was 
the slide. 

It was a small one, only about 
six feet high, obviously designed 
for toddlers and not for a boy of 
eleven. Nonetheless, the boy 
headed for it eagerly. 



165 



But he’d hardly set foot upon 
the bottom step of the ladder 
when the schoolhouse door burst 
open a second time. A young 
woman charged toward him shout- 
ing, “Paul! Get down from there 
at once! Paul!” 

She was an attractive woman, 
but her voice held a note of panic. 
She ran so swiftly that Paul, 
whose ascent of the ladder was 
accelerated rather than retarded 
by her command, hadn’t quite 
reached the top when she seized 
him around the legs and tried to 
drag him down. 

“Please, Miss Terry!” he plead- 
ed desperately. “Just this once let 
me get to the top! Let me slide 
down it just once!” 

“Get to the top?” Miss Terry 
was aghast. “You could fall and 
kill yourself. Down you come this 
instant!” 

“Just one time!” Paul wailed. 
“Let me do it just once!” 

Miss Terry paid no heed to his 
anguished cries. She tugged at his 
legs while Paul clung to the hand- 
rails. But he was the weaker of 
the two, and in a few seconds Miss 
Terry had torn him loose and set 
him on the ground. Then, seizing 
him firmly by the hand, she led 
him back toward the schoolhouse. 

Paul went along, sniveling mis- 
erably. They entered the building 
and the play yard was once more 
silent and deserted. 

“By God, Staghorn,” Peccary 
166 



thundered, “you’ve doctored it! 
You’ve deliberately fed false in- 
formation into Humanac’s mem- 
ory cells!” 

Staghorn turned to glare at his 
guest, his eyes flaming at the out- 
rageous suggestion. “The only 
hypothetical element I’ve fed into 
Humanac is your Y Hormone, Dr. 
Peccary! You saw me do it. You 
watched me check the computer 
before we started.” 

“I refuse to believe that my Y 
Hormone will bring about the 
consequences that machine is pre- 
dicting!” 

“It’s the only new factor that 
was added.” 

“How can you say that? During 
the next hundred years a thou- 
sand other factors can enter in.” 
“But the Y Hormone bears an 
essential relationship to the whole. 
Sit down and stop waving your 
arms. I’m going to see if we can 
get into the school.” 

Peccary sat down, seething. 

¥ T had been a mistake to bring 
his Y Hormone to Staghorn. It 
was simply that he’d been think- 
ing of himself as such a benefac- 
tor to the human race that he 
couldn’t wait to see a sample of 
the bright future he intended to 
create. 

“Think of it, Staghorn!” he’d 
said happily, earlier in the eve- 
ning. “The phrase ‘art is long and 
time is fleeting’ won’t mean any- 

G ALAXY 



[thing any more! Artists will have 
hundreds of years to paint their 
pictures. Think of the books that 
'will be written, the music that will 
be composed, the magnificent 
cities that will be built! Everyone 
(will have time enough to achieve 
perfection. Think of your work 
and mine. We’ll live long enough 
to unravel all the mysteries of the 
universe!” 

Staghorn had said nothing. In- 
stead, he’d uncorked the small 
bottle Dr. Peccary had given him 
and sniffed at it. 

The bottle contained a sample 
of the Y Hormone which Dr. Pec- 
‘cary had spent many years de- 
veloping. Its principal ingredient 
was a glandular extract from in- 
sects, an organic compound that 
controlled the insects’ aging proc- 
ess. If administered artificially, it 
could keep insects in the larval 
'stage almost indefinitely. 

Dr. Peccary’s great contribution 
had been to synthesize this extract 
— which affected only insects — 
with protein elements that could 
be assimilated by mammals and 
humans. It had required years of 
experimentation, but the result 
was his Y Hormone — Y for 
Youth. 

In his laboratory he now had 
playful kittens that were six years 
old and puppies that should have 
been fully grown dogs. The only 
human he’d so far experimented on 
was himself. But because he’d 



started taking the hormone only 
recently, he was as yet unable to 
say positively that it was respon- 
sible for the splendid health he 
was enjoying. His impatience to 
know the sociological conse- 
quences of the hormone had made 
him bring a sample of it to Stag- 
horn. 

After sniffing at the bottle, 
Staghorn had poured its Contents 
into Humanac’s analyzer. 

The giant computer gurgled 
and belched a few seconds while it 
assessed the nature of the formu- 
la. Then Staghorn connected the 
analyzer with the machine’s mem- 
ory units. 

As far as Humanac was con- 
cerned, the Y Hormone was now 
an accepted part of human his- 
tory. 

But, except for this one added 
factor, the rest of Humanac’s vast 
memory was solidly based upon 
the complete known history of the 
earth and the human race. Its 
principles of operation were the 
same as those controlling other 
electronic “brains,” which could 
be programmed to predict tides, 
weather, election results or the 
state of a department-store inven- 
tory at any given date in the fu- 
ture. Humanac differed chiefly in 
the tremendously greater capacity 
of its memory cells. Over the 
years it had digested thousands 
of books, codifying and coordi- 
nating the information as fast as 

167 



THE IMMORTALS 



it was received. Its photocells had 
recorded millions of visual im- 
pressions. Its auditory units had 
absorbed the music and languages 
of the centuries. And its methods 
of evaluation had been given a 
strictly human touch by feeding 
into its resistance chambers the 
cephalic wave patterns produced 
by the brains of Staghorn’s col- 
leagues. 

A N added feature, though by no 
means an original one, was 
the screen upon which Humanac 
produced visually the events of 
the time and place for which the 
controls were set. 

This screen was simply the big 
end of a cathode-ray tube, similar 
to those used in television sets. 
It was adapted from LB.M.’s 704 
electronic computer used by the 
Vanguard tracking center to pro- 
duce visual predictions of the 
orbits of artificial satellites. 

Staghorn was constantly having 
trouble explaining to people that 
Humanac was not a time machine 
that could look into the past or 
future. Its pictures of past events 
were based upon information al- 
ready present in its memory cells. 
Its pictures of future events were 
predictions calculated according to 
the laws of probability. But be- 
cause Humanac, unlike a human, 
never forgot any of the million 
and one variables impinging upon 
any human situation, its predic- 
168 



tions were startlingly accurate. 

Humanac had never been ex- 
posed to pictures of Dr. Peccary’s 
home town nor to those of a girl 
named Jenny Cheever. It arrived 
at the likeness of both town and 
girl through a purely mathemati- 
cal process. 

Staghorn’s ultimate purpose in 
building the machine was to use 
it in developing a true science of 
history. Because Humanac was 
only a machine, Staghorn could 
alter its memory at will. By re- 
moving the tiny unit upon which 
the Battle of Hastings was re- 
corded and then “re-playing” Eng- 
lish history without it, he could 
find out what actual effect that 
particular battle had. 

He was surprised to discover 
that it had very little. According 
to Humanac, the Normans would 
have conquered England anyway 
a few months later. 

At another time, while review- 
ing the events leading up to the 
American Revolution, Humanac 
had produced a picture of Benja- 
min Franklin kissing a beautiful 
young woman in the office of his 
printing shop. On impulse Stag- 
horn removed this seemingly in- 
significant event from Humanac’s 
memory and then turned the time 
dial forward to the present to see 
what effect, if any, the episode had 
had upon history. 

To his amazement, with that 
single kiss missing, Humanac pro- 
G A L AXY 



duced a picture of the American 
continent composed of six differ- 
ent nations speaking French, Ger- 
man, Chinese, Hindu, Arabic and 
Muskogean — the last being the 
language of an Indian nation oc- 
cupying the Mississippi Valley 
and extending northward to Lake 
Winnepeg. It served as a buffer 
state between the Hindus and 
Chinese in the west and the 
French, Germans and Arabs to 
the east. 

I T was Humanac’s ability to pre- 
dict the future consequences 
of any hypothetical event, how- 
ever, that made it an instrument 
capable of revolutionizing history. 
Once its dependability was thor- 
oughly established, it would be 
possible for a Secretary of State 
to submit to Humanac the con- 
tents of a note intended for a 
foreign country, then turn the 
;time controls ahead and get Hu- 
manac’s prediction of the note’s 
consequences. 

If the consequences were good, 
the note would then be sent. 

If they were bad, the Secretary 
could destroy the note and try 
others — until he composed one 
that produced the desired result. 

Humanac’s flaw was that it had 
no way of explaining the predic- 
tions produced on its screen. It 
merely showed what would hap- 
pen when and if certain things 
were done. It left it up to the 
THE I M MORTALS 



human operator to figure out why 
things happened that way. 

This was what was troubling 
Dr. Peccary. 

He could see not the remotest 
relationship between his Y Hor- 
mone and the fact that a mathe- 
matical probability named Miss 
Terry should refuse another math- 
ematical probability named Paul 
permission to climb to the top of 
a six-foot playground slide. 

Meanwhile Staghorn had been 
using the fine adjustment on the 
geographic locator and now grunt- 
ed his satisfaction. “Good! We’re 
in the building, at least.” 

On the screen was a dusky cor- 
ridor. On either side of it were 
classroom doors, some closed, 
some ajar. Staghorn moved his 
hand from the fine adjustment to 
the even more delicate vernier 
control which permitted him to 
shift the geographic focus inches 
at a time. The focus drifted slow- 
ly forward to one of the half-open 
doors, and then he and Dr. Pec- 
cary were able to see into the 
classroom. 

It was deserted. Desks were 
thick with dust. Books, yellow 
with age, were strewn on the floor. 

Staghorn’s hand sought the ver- 
nier control again. The picture 
led them on down the corridor to 
another open door. 

Again it was a scene of desola- 
tion. 

“This can have nothing to do 

169 



with my Y Hormone!” Peccary in- 
sisted. 

“Then why is your picture on 
the wall there?” Staghorn said 
with a note of malicious pleasure. 

Dr. Peccary looked and started. 
On the classroom wall was a faded 
photograph of himself. Except that 
he was wearing a different suit in 
the picture, he looked just as he 
looked at the present moment. 
Staghorn got a closer focus on the 
photograph so that Peccary could 
read the legend beneath it. Dr. 
Clarence Peccary, the man who 
gave the world the Y Hormone. 

“All right then,” said Peccary, 
somewhat modified by this tribute. 
“If they put my picture on school 
room walls a hundred years from 
now, it means I’m an honored man, 
a man the world admires. And 
therefore the Y Hormone can’t be 
the cause of all this desolation!” 

“I’ve found that Humanac’s 
reasoning and human reasoning 
differ in many ways,” said Stag- 
horn. On the screen they were out 
in the corridor again when from 
somewhere ahead came a woman’s 
voice. 

“You may recite now, Paul. 
Please stand up.” 

“Ah, that sounds like Miss 
Terry,” said Staghorn. He fingered 
the vernier control. The focal 
point slid forward along the cor- 
ridor. 

“Stand up and recite, Paul,” 
Miss Terry said more sharply. 

170 



“I think they’re in the room on 
the left,” said Peccary. 

II 

'T’HE focus shifted to the open 
door and then Peccary and 
Staghorn could see into the class- 
room. This one was in slightly 
better order than the others and 
was occupied by two people. In I 
front sat Miss Terry, obviously i 
the teacher, and at one of the 
desks sat Paul. He seemed to be 
the entire class. At Miss Terry’s ' 
urging he was coming to his feet, 
his face still stained with tears. 
He held his book a few inches 
from his nose and stared over the 
top of it sullenly. 

“Go ahead, Paul,” said Miss 
Terry, sweetly stubborn. 'Tm 
waiting.” 

Paul looked at his book and 
read from it in a monotone, enun- 
ciating each word carefully as 
though it had no relationship to 
the other words. “I am a human 
being and as long as I obey the 
six rules I shall live forever.” 

“Very good, Paul. Now read the 
six rules.” 

Paul sniffled loudly and com- 
menced reading again. “Rule one: ; 
I must never go near fire or my 
clothing may catch aflame and 
burn me up. Rule two: I must 
keep away from deep water or I 
may fall in and drown. Rule three: 

I must stay away from high places 

GALAXY 



or I may fall and dash my brains 
out.” He paused to sniffle and wipe 
his nose on his sleeve, then sighed 
and continued dismally. “Rule 
four: I must never play with sharp 
things or I may cut myself and 
bleed to death. Rule five: I must 
never ride horses or I may fall off 
and break my neck.” Paul paused, 
lowering his book. 

“And the sixth rule?” said Miss 
Terry. “Go ahead and read the 
sixth rule.” 

Reluctantly Paul lifted his 
book. “Rule six: Starting when 
I’m twenty-one I must take Dr. 
Peccary’s Y Hormone once a 
week to keep me young and 
healthy forever.” 

“Excellent, Paul!” said Miss 
Terry. “And which rule were you 
breaking just now on the play- 
ground?” 

“I was breaking Rule Three,” 
Paul said, then quoted sadly, “I 
must stay away from high places 
or I may fall and dash my brains 
out.” 

TTk R. PECCARY was on his feet 
stomping around in front of 
the computer. “Sheer idiocy,” he 
muttered. “He doesn’t have any 
brains to dash out! I’ll admit that 
a computer with sufficient infor- 
mation about the state of the 
world might be able to make ac- 
curate predictions of events a few 
months or possibly a year into the 
future — but not one hundred 
THE I MMORTALS 



years! In that long an interval 
even the most trivial error could 
distort every circuit in the ma- 
chine.” He jabbed a finger toward 
the screen where Paul was seated 
at his desk again. “And that’s what 
that picture is — a distortion. I’m 
not going to let it influence me 
one bit in what I intend to — ” 
He broke off because of what was 
happening on the screen. 

From somewhere outside the 
school building came the wail of 
a deep-throated alarm. Both Miss 
Terry and Paul were on their feet 
and by their expressions, terrified. 

“The Atavars!” Paul cried, his 
entire body shaking. 

“To the basement, Paul!” Miss 
Terry’s face was blanched as she 
grasped Paul’s hand and headed 
toward the door. But halfway 
there, both came to a halt, breath- 
less and staring. 

A powerful bearded man strode 
into the classroom. 

Paul and Miss Terry fell back 
as he advanced. He was a man of 
about fifty, his bushy hair shot 
with gray, his eyes cold and blue. 
He was followed by two younger 
men who studied Paul and Miss 
Terry with interest. All three wore 
rough work clothing. 

The bearded man pointed at 
Paul. “There’s the boy,” he said 
quietly. “Take him.” 

Paul let out a shriek of terror 
and fled into a corner as the two 
men advanced. He clawed futilely 

171 






as they laid hands on him. “For 
God’s sake, shut up,” one' of the 
men said with more disgust than 
anger. He pinioned Paul’s arms 
while the other man bound them 
together with a strip of cloth. 

Miss Terry meanwhile had col- 
lapsed into her chair. One of 
Paul’s captors glanced at her and 
spoke to the bearded man. “What 
about her?” 

The bearded man stepped close 
to Miss Terry and put a hand on 
her shoulder. She recoiled as from 
a snake. “How old are you?” he 
asked. Miss Terry made some in- 
articulate squeaks and the man 
spoke more sharply. “When were 
you born?” 

“Two thousand four,” she man- 
aged to stutter. 

The bearded man considered 
this and shook his head. “Over 
fifty. By that time they’re hope- 
less. Leave her and bring the boy.” 

Miss Terry let out an agonized 
wail of protest and fainted across 
her desk. One of the men slung 
Paul over his shoulder and the 
bearded leader led the group from 
the room. 

A MAZING,” murmured Stag- 

J -*- horn. “Absolutely amazing. 
One never knows what to expect.” 

“Pure gibberish,” said Peccary, 
then betrayed his interest by say- 
ing, “Can you follow them?” 

“I’m trying to.” Staghorn 
worked at the geographic adjust- 
172 



ment and finally got the screen 
focused on the corridor again. It 
was deserted. The bearded man 
and his companions had already 
departed. Staghorn touched the 
controls again, the screen flickered 
and once more the little park 
came into focus. But now it, too, 
was deserted. None of the ragged 
men and women were in sight, 
neither in the park nor on the 
street beyond. Staghorn twisted 
the focus in all directions without 
discovering anyone. 

“That whistle we heard was ob- 
viously some kind of alarm,” he 
said. “Everyone must be in hiding 
— from the Atavars, whoever they 
are. I strongly suspect that beard- 
ed fellow of being one.” 

“You might as well shut it off, 
Staghorn,” Dr. Peccary Said cold- 
ly. “It’s too much nonsense for any 
sane man to swallow. And unless 
that machine can provide a full 
and satisfactory explanation as to 
why my Y Hormone will bring 
about the conditions depicted on 
that screen, I see no reason to 
keep the hormone off the market.” 
Staghorn turned from the con- 
trols to study his companion. “The 
only possible way that Humanac 
could give us the entire back- 
ground of events leading up to 
what we’ve just seen would be to 
set the time control to the present 
and then leave the machine run- 
ning until it arrived at this same 
period again. That would take a 
GALAXY 






hundred years, and I’m not going 
to sit here that long. What’s more, 
I’m not going to touch your Y 
Hormone even if you do put it 
on the market.” 

“There’ll be plenty who will!” 
“That’s what Humanac says, 
yes.” 

Dr. Peccary gestured despair- 
ingly. After all, he did have a 
conscience. “I simply don’t believe 
my hormone can be responsible!” 
“I’ll remind you that your pic- 
ture was on the classroom wall 
and that the sixth rule read by 
that boy indicated that he was 
supposed to start using your hor- 
mone when he reached the age 
of twenty-one. That would be 
about the age to stop growing 
older.” 

“That boy is nothing but a 
mathematical probability!” 



Unp HAT'S a h you and I are,” 
Staghorn said owlishly. 
“Mathematical probabilities. De- 
spite Omar, nothing exactly like 
either of us has ever existed be- 
fore or will exist again.” 

“But damn it. Staghorn . .” 
Dr. Peccary sat down, his face in 
his hands. “It’s worth millions! 
I’ve invested years of work and 
all the money I could scrape to- 
gether. I don’t see anything wrong 
in a scientist’s profiting by his 
discoveries. And to keep it off the 
market just because that insane 
computer says that a hundred 



THE IMMORTALS 

i 



years from now—” He broke off, 
glaring at Humanac’s screen which 
was still focused on the deserted 
park. “It simply doesn’t make 
sense! The machine doesn’t give 
any reasons for anything. If there 
were a way I could talk directly 
to some of those mathematical 
probabilities, question them, ask 
them what it’s all about . .” He 
was on his feet, striding back and 
forth before the computer again. 

“Perhaps there is a way,” Stag- 
horn said quietly. 

“Eh?” 

“I said that it may be possible 
for you to talk with them.” 

“How?” 

“By making your mind a tem- 
porary part of the computer.” 

Peccary studied the huge ma- 
chine apprehensively — its ranks 
of memory units, its chambers of 
flickering tubes, the labyrinth of 
circuits. “How would you go about 
it?” 

“I put you in the transmitter,” 
Staghorn said. He stepped away 
from the console and slid back a 
panel to reveal a niche with a seat 
in it. Above the seat was a sort 
of helmet that resembled a hair 
drier in a beauty parlor, except 
that it was studded with hundreds 
of tiny magnets and transistors. 
Staghorn indicated the helmet. 
“This picks up and amplifies brain 
waves. I’ve used it to record the 
cephalic wave pattern of about a 
hundred men and women. The re- 



173 



cordings are built into the com- 
puter, enabling Humanac to assign 
a mathematical evaluation to the 
influence of human emotion in 
making historic decisions. In your 
case, instead of making a record- 
ing of your brain waves, I’d feed 
the impulses directly into Huma- 
nac’s memory units.” 

“And what would happen 
then?” 

“I’m not altogether sure,” said 
Staghorn, and it seemed to Pec- 
cary that Staghorn was finding a 
definite relish in his uncertainty. 
“I’ve never tried the experiment 
before.” 

“I might get electrocuted?” 
“No. There’s no danger of that 
happening. The current that acti- 
vates the transmitter comes from 
your own brain, and as you know, 
such electrical impulses are ex- 
tremely feeble. That isn’t what 
worries me.” 

“Well then, what does?” 

“In 'some ways Humanac be- 
haves peculiarly like a living or- 
ganism. For example, there’s one 
prediction it can never make. Sev- 
eral times I’ve fed into it the 
hypothetical information that the 
two opposing factions of the world 
have declared war. Naturally 
everyone would like to know 
about the outcome of such a war.” 
Staghorn paused, gazing lovingly 
at his majestic creation. 

“And what happens?” Dr. Pec- 
cary said impatiently. 

174 



“Nothing. That’s just it. The 
moment I turn Humanac into 
the future to get a prediction, the 
screen goes dead. Do you know 
why it goes dead?” Staghorn 
looked at Peccary with a pleased 
smile and didn’t wait for Peccary 
to cue him. “It goes dead because, 
if war were declared, Humanac 
would be the first target for enemy 
bombs. When it predicts a future 
event, it has to take all factors 
into consideration. If one of those 
factors is its own destruction, it 
can predict nothing beyond that 
moment.” 

T3ECCARY repeated this sen- 
tence in his mind while he 
slowly digested its meaning. What 
it seemed to mean was that, al- 
though Staghorn and Peccary 
thought of Humanac as only a 
complicated machine, Humanac’s 
opinion of itself was altogether 
otherwise. It could foresee its own 
death. 

“I often wonder,” mused Stag- 
horn, “about those people we see 
wandering around on Staghorn’s 
screen. To us they’re only images 
made by a stream of electrons hit- 
ting the end of a cathode ray tube. 
Their space and time is an illu- 
sion. All the same, Humanac com- 
prises an entire system — a system 
modeled as accurately as possible 
on our own. It’s just possible that 
the boy we saw, Paul, was experi- 
encing a real terror.” 



GALAXY 



Dr. Peccary examined Staghorn 
in amazement. He had often sus- 
pected that Staghorn’s genius was 
tinged with madness. “You’re not 
suggesting that those . those 
images are conscious?” 

“Ah! What is consciousness?” 

“I didn’t come here to get into 
a metaphysical argument.” 

“No, but it’s only fair for me to 
suggest the possible emotional haz- 
zards involved in hooking you up 
to Humanac. Because you have to 
admit that you’// be conscious 
during the experiment.” 

“Certainly. But I’ll be sitting 
right there.” Peccary pointed to 
the seat in the transmitter unit. 

“In a sense, yes. Very well, take 
your seat.” 

Peccary eyed the helmet un- 
easily “I’m not sure I want to do 
this.” 

“But you do want to make mil- 
lions from the Y Hormone. And 
you want to enjoy it with a clear 
conscience. Perhaps it’s as you say 
— there may be other factors in- 
volved. By knowing what they are 
you may be able to negate their 
influence.” Staghorn’s voice was a 
soft purr as he took Dr. Peccary’s 
arm and urged him into the trans- 
mitter unit. Peccary sat down. 
The seat was small and hard. 

“Just bear one thing in mind,” 
Staghorn said. “Don’t get lost. It 
will be best if you stay in the little 
park where I can see you and 
where you’ll be in focus. Unless 
THE IMMORTALS 



you’re in focus it might be impos- 
sible to — ah — disengage you.” 

Dr. Peccary could find no mean- 
ing whatsoever in this statement, 
except confirmation of his suspi- 
cion that Staghorn was mad. He 
felt this so strongly that he started 
to rise from his seat and escape 
from the transmitter cell. But at 
that moment Staghorn lowered 
the helmet onto his head. The sen- 
sation he experienced was so novel 
and startling that he remained 
seated. For a second or two he 
could feel the tiny metallic con- 
tacts on the inside of the helmet 
pressing against his skull, but this 
sensation of physical pressure van- 
ished almost at once. It was re- 
placed by one of headlessness. His 
body up to his chin still seemed 
to be sitting in the transmitter — 
but his intellect had lost com- 
pletely its sense of localization in 
the head. 

He could think clearly enough, 
but had no notion as to the spot 
where his thoughts originated. In- 
deed, the whole concept of rela- 
tive position seemed ridiculous. 
At the same instant he felt tall as 
a mountain and as low as a rug. 
His mind could fill the entire uni- 
verse, while resting neatly in a 
thimble. He could also see Stag- 
horn, for his eyes continued to 
function and transmit optical pat- 
terns, but precisely where he was 
while receiving these patterns he 
couldn’t possibly say. 



175 



He heard Staghorn remark, 
“Fine. The connection is perfect. 
It’s always better when the sub- 
ject is bald. I’m going to switch 
you over into Humanac’s circuits 
now.” 

Staghorn’s hand moved across 
the controls and one of his long 
fingers flipped a switch. 

THIS was the last Dr. Peccary 
saw of Roger Staghorn. In- 
stantly he found himself standing 
in the center of the small park 
in his home town. His reaction was 
not one of alarm. Quite to the 
contrary, his immediate thought 
was one of surprise that he wasn’t 
alarmed. Standing there in the 
little square felt entirely normal 
and proper. 

Next he was jolted by the reali- 
zation that he must be an image 
on Humanac’s screen. He quickly 
looked about in all directions, half 
expecting to see Staghorn’s huge 
face peering down from the sky 
like God. There was no sign of 
Staghorn, however. The world 
about him was as three-dimension- 
al as any he’d ever known. He 
was in his home town a hundred 
years after he’d last seen it. 

Good lord! He was a hundred 
and forty-two years old! 

This realization was followed 
by a host of others. Like a man 
coming out of amnesia, his past be- 
gan filling with memories. He was 
rich. He was the richest man on 



earth. His Y Hormone was used 
the world over. A mile away, on 
the outskirts of town, he could see 
a portion of his huge production 
plant. He lived in a majestic pal- 
ace surrounded by every manner 
of automatic protective device. 
Protection? From what? And how 
had he dared to venture out here 
in the park alone? But wait . 
wait. It was all an illusion. Actu- 
ally he was only an image on 
Humanac’s screen, a mathematical 
probability. 

He must keep that fact firmly 
in mind, or he might lose his men- 
tal balance. 

He gazed about at the town, 
dismayed by its appearance. Not 
a person in sight. Not even an 
automobile. Of course, the motor 
car might have become obsolete 
during the passage of a hundred 
years. There must be some new 
mode of transportation — some- 
thing undreamed of a century ago! 

While he was wondering what 
this might be, he heard a clop- 
clop-clopping and was astonished 
to see three horsemen approaching 
the square. As they came closer 
he recognized them as the bearded 
man and his two companions. 

The boy Paul was bound firmly 
behind one of the saddles. 

A strange panic arose in Dr. 
Peccary’s breast, but he managed 
to suppress it with a reminder 
that this was all illusion. He was 
here for purposes of information;

he must have the courage to get 
| it. So he forced himself to the 
curb at the edge of the park. When 
J the riders were within speaking 
; distance, he managed to hail them 
with, “Hey, you!” 

His nervousness made his words 
harsh. But then, there was no rea- 
son why he should speak politely 
i to kidnapers. He saw that Paul 
was conscious. The boy had a gag 
over his mouth but his eyes were 
i open. 

. ' | 1 HE three riders reined in their 
horses and looked at Peccary 
with frank curiosity. 

“Here’s one that didn’t hide,” 
one of them remarked, in a tone 
that Dr. Peccary decided was dis- 
respectful. He stepped forward 
boldly. 

“May I ask what you intend to 
do with that boy?” he demanded. 

“He wants to know what we 
intend to do with the boy,” said 
the same man. 

“Yes, I heard what he said,” 
the bearded man remarked quiet- 
ly. He hadn’t ceased to study Pec- 
cary with his piercing blue eyes. 
Now he urged his horse closer. 
“You must be a stranger here, 
son?” 

“Not exactly,” said Peccary. 
“As a matter of fact, I was born 
here. That was some time ago and 
it’s true I haven’t been here re- 
cently.” The way the bearded man 
stared at him made him extremely 
THE I MMORTALS 



nervous. “But I’m sure that kid- 
naping is against the law. If you 
don’t release that boy I’ll have to 
— to make a citizen’s arrest!” Pec- 
cary knew that his words sounded 
ridiculous. From the way the three 
riders exchanged glances it was 
evident that they thought the 
same thing. 

“He’s going to make a citizen’s 
arrest,” commented the one who 
liked to repeat whatever Peccary 
said. 

“Hush,” said the bearded leader. 
And then to Peccary, “What’s 
your name, son?” 

“Clarence Peccary. If you don’t 
do as I say I’ll — ” He stopped 
short, his heart leaping as the force 
of his indiscretion struck him. 

The three men had been struck 
also. 

The two younger ones were al- 
ready on the ground, one on either 
side of him. Only the bearded man 
remained mounted. He leaned for- 
ward. “I thought you looked fa- 
miliar. You’re Doctor Peccary of 
the Y Hormone?” His voice was 
a menacing whisper. Peccary final- 
ly answered with a slow nod. 

“He must have flipped, running 
around alone like this,” a man be- 
side him said. “However, let’s 
never insult fortune!” 

This was the last Dr. Peccary 
heard. For at that instant one of 
the men — he never knew which — 
struck him forcibly over the head 
with a blunt instrument.

Ill 

A T Humanac’s controls Roger 
Staghorn leaped to his feet in 
alarm as he saw what was hap- 
pening on the screen. 

Peccary had collapsed now. The 
two men were draping him across 
the bearded man’s saddle. There 
wasn’t an instant to lose! Stag- 
horn leaped to the transmitter cell 
where Peccary’s material body 
was seated, his eyes peacefully 
closed. Staghorn flipped the switch 
to disengage Peccary’s conscious- 
ness from Humanac’s circuits. 

Nothing happened. Peccary’s 
body remained as before, blissfully 
asleep. 

Good lord, of course nothing 
happened! How could it? Peccary 
had just been knocked cold; at 
the moment he didn’t have any 
consciousness! Staghorn opened 
the circuit again and' whirled back 
to the control console. 

He looked at the screen. All 
three men were mounted again. 
The bearded leader gestured them 
on. 

They set spurs to their horses 
and galloped away, taking the un- 
conscious Peccary with them. 

“No!” Staghorn shouted at the 
fleeing images. “No, Dr. Peccary! 
Stay in focus!” The horsemen paid 
no heed — nor did Staghorn ex- 
pect them to, rationally. His 
shouts were only involuntary ex- 
pressions of despair. Grasping the 
178 



geographic locator, he twiddled it 
wildly, managing to keep the three 
riders in focus for several blocks 
as they sped down a street of the 
deserted town. 

Then they rounded a comer 
and he lost them. 

By the time he got a focus on 
the area around the corner they 
were gone. For several minutes he 
continued to search, shifting the 
focal point all over town, but in 
vain. Dr. Clarence Peccary was 
lost inside Humanac’s labyrin- 
thean brain! 

Staghorn was stunned. There 
would be no difficulty in keeping 
Peccary’s physical body alive in- 
definitely by intravenous feeding, 
but it was as good as dead while 
separated from its sense of iden- 
tity. Worse yet were the probable 
consequences to Humanac of hav- 
ing a free soul loose in its mathe- 
matical universe. These were too 
dire to contemplate. The ma- 
chine’s reliability might be alto- 
gether mined and Staghorn’s life 
work destroyed. Under the cir- 
cumstances there was but one 
course of action. He had to find 
Dr. Peccary and get him back into 
focus, so that he could be disen- 
gaged from the computer. 

First Staghorn focused the geo- 
graphic locator on the town 
square, the point from which Pec- 
cary had been abducted; from 
there he could begin tracking him. 
Next he set the time control so 



GALAXY 




THE IMMORTALS 



that it would automatically dis- 
engage the transmitter units in 
exactly three hours. 

Whether or not he could find 
Dr. Peccary in that period of time 
Staghorn had no way of knowing; 
but at least he should be able to 
get himself back into focus at the 
proper moment. Then, in case he’d 
failed to find Peccary, he could re- 
set the time clock and try again. 

Next he opened a second trans- 
mitter unit, sat down on the little 
seat and pulled the helmet down 
on his head. As sensations of vast- 
ness and lost dimensions spread 
through him, he reached out and 
pressed down the switch that 
would pour his own brain impulses 
into Humanac’s circuits. 

T NSTANTLY, as with Dr. Pec- 
cary, Staghorn found himself 
standing in the little park. 

He examined his hands and 
slapped his sides a few times, tak- 
ing time to assimilate the fact that 
he felt perfectly solid. Ah, Bishop 
Berkeley was right all the time! 
The universe was subjective — a 
creation of consciousness! 

He left off these speculations 
and recalled himself to his mis- 
sion. 

Glancing around, he saw that 
people were beginning to reap- 
pear. They came up from base- 
ments and out of the doors of the 
dilapidated houses and buildings. 
If there had been a panic, there 

180 



was no sign of it now. The men 
and women moved indolently, re- 
turning toward the park and the 
sunlit streets. All were so much 
the same age and of such similar 
beauty that it was difficult to dis- 
tinguish individual members of 
the same sex. But he finally rec- 
ognized the girl Dr. Peccary had 
identified as Jenny Cheever. She 
had an attractive strawberry birth- 
mark on her hip. 

She strolled back into the park 
accompanied by a young man. 
The two of them took possession 
of the bench where Jenny had 
been seated earlier. They sat well 
apart from each other, silently 
contemplating the other passers- 
by. 

Feeling that his knowledge of 
Jenny’s name constituted a sort of 
introduction, Staghorn approached 
the couple. The man paid no at- 
tention to him but Jenny watched 
him curiously. Staghorn was not a 
man over whom women swooned, 
and it occurred to him that she 
found something odd about his 
dark suit and thick spectacles. He 
seemed to be the only man in 
town wearing either. 

“How do you do,” he said to 
her. “I believe you’re Ben Chee- 
ver’s daughter.” 

She continued to examine him 
languidly, slowly stroking a heavy 
strand of her auburn hair. “Am I?” 
she said at last. “It’s been so long 
I’ve forgotten. But then I had to 
GALAXY 



be someone’s daughter and since 
my name is Cheever, you may be 
right. I don’t remember you. We 
must have met ages and ages ago.” 
“This is the first time we’ve 
met. You were pointed out to me 
by a friend.” 

She considered this with a 
puzzled air, and, idly curious, said, 
“Do you want to marry me?” 
“Good heavens, no!” 

Jenny didn’t seem to be insulted 
by his abruptness. “I just won- 
dered why you’d speak to me,” she 
said. “Because if you want to 
marry me you have to wait. I’ve 
promised to marry him first.” She 
gestured to the man on the bench 
with her. The man looked at Stag- 
horn for the first time. 

“Yeah,” he said. 

SEE,” said Staghorn. “And 
when is this . merry event 
to take place?” 

“Some day,” Jenny said indif- 
ferently. “When we both feel like 
it. There’s no use rushing things. 
I don’t want to use up all the men 
too soon.” 

“Use them up?” 

“He’ll be my twenty-fifth hus- 
band.” 

“Yeah,” said the man. “She’ll 
be my thirty-second wife.” 

“Your marriages can’t last very 
long,” said Staghorn. Despite the 
physical attractiveness of both 
Jenny and her escort, Staghorn 
began to feel clammy in their 
THE IMMORTALS 



presence. He had an impression of 
deep ill health, a sense of unclean, 
almost reptilian lassitude. 

“They get shorter all the time,” 
said Jenny, and turned away as 
though the conversation bored her. 
The man too had lost interest. 

Staghorn stood ignored for a 
moment and then spoke bluntly. 

‘Who are the Atavars?” 

The word produced the first 
genuine reaction. Jenny leaped to 
her feet. The man turned red. 

“Don’t say that word!” Jenny 
said. 

“I’m sorry. I’m a stranger.” 

“No one can be that much of a 
stranger!” 

“It’s indecent,” the man said. He 
stood up and touched Jenny’s arm. 
“I feel my blood pounding. Let’s 
go get married.” 

Jenny nodded and, with a cold 
glance at Staghorn, moved away 
with her companion. Staghorn was 
tempted to follow and demand an 
answer to his question when he 
saw Miss Terry approaching. Miss 
Terry was more likely to have the 
information he needed, and in any 
case — since she was only in her 
fifties — she was less than half of 
Jenny Cheever’s age. He hoped 
this would make a difference 
in her attitude. That she was cap- 
able of emotion he already knew. 
Her expression, as she approached, 
was disconsolate. 

Staghorn bowed low before her 
and introduced himself. “Good af- 



181 






ternoon, Miss Terry. I’m a stranger 
to you but since you’re a teacher 
by profession, you may have heard 
of me. I’m Dr. Roger Staghorn.” He 
straightened, twisted his lips into 
a smile and waited for Miss Terry 
to associate his name with those 
scientific achievements that had so 
startled the world a hundred years 
earlier. To his chagrin Miss Terry 
only gazed at him blankly and 
shook her head. 

WIVO,” she murmured. Then 
' tears formed in her eyes 
and she tried to move on. Stag- 
horn stopped her. 

“Forgive me,” he said. “I’m 
aware of your recent loss. Your 
pupil, Paul.” 

Her tears dropped more freely. 
“Sooner or later I knew they’d get 
him. The only child in town. And 
now I have nothing to do. Noth- 
ing at all!” 

“They? Just who are they — 
the Atavars?” 

Miss Terry turned pale. “Don’t 
say it,” she pleaded. “In time I’ll 
forget.” 

“But where have they taken 
Paul? And what will they do with 
him?” 

“He’ll die, of course.” She spoke 
these words almost indifferently, 
then wept copiously as she added, 
“But I’ll live on with nothing to 
do!” 

“Then why didn’t someone stop 
them?” He gestured angrily at the 
182 



handsome young males wander- 
ing through the park. “All these 
men — why don’t they rescue 
Paul?” 

This suggestion so shocked Miss 
Terry that she stopped weeping. ; 
“That’s impossible! There’d be vi- 
olence. Someone might get killed!” 
“They think of that with a boy’s 
life at stake?” Staghorn felt his 
rage rising. He was an irascible 
man by nature and had controlled 
himself so far only because he 
knew he was part of an illusion. 
The sense of illusion was fading 
rapidly, however. The guiding 
principles of morals and ethics 
were themselves abstractions and 
therefore operated just as power- 
fully in an abstract universe. He 
grasped Miss Terry by the arm. 

“I’ll go after him myself. Where 
do I find him?” 

“You can’t find him! If you fol- 
low they’ll capture you too!” 

“I’ll chance that! Where have 
they gone?” 

“I can’t tell you! They might 
punish me!” 

Staghorn shook her heartily, 
ignoring the fact that she was 
over fifty. “Tell me! It so happens 
that besides Paul, they’ve captured 
Dr. Clarence Peccary, and I’m re- 
sponsible for his life!” 

At this statement Miss Terry 
let out a cry of horror. “They’ve 
caught Dr. Peccary? No! No!” 
“They most certainly have. So 
hurry up and tell me — ” 

GALAXY 



“We’ll all die!” wailed Miss 
Terry. “We’ll all die!” 

“In that case it can’t hurt you 
to tell me.” 

“The mountains!” cried Miss 
Terry. “High Canyon!” 

It was with great difficulty that 
Staghorn forced directions from 
her. The news of Peccary’s capture 
had unsettled her entirely. But 
despite the roughness with which 
he was forced to use her, no one 
came to her rescue. Several young 
men and women gathered at a safe 
distance to watch, but they did 
nothing to interfere. 

S TAGHORN finally elicited the 
information that High Canyon 
was several miles north of town 
and could be reached by follow- 
ing a dirt road. To his inquiry as 
to where he could rent a car, Miss 
Terry went blank again. There 
were no cars. They had been 
abolished before Miss Terry was 
born. She thought there might be 
one in the museum. 

Staghorn glanced at his watch. 
He’d already been in the trans- 
mitter thirty minutes. He had only 
two and a half hours to get to 
High Canyon, rescue Dr. Peccary 
and Paul and return to the square. 
He dared not cut it too fine. 
He’d have to be back with a few 
minutes to spare. 

So, after learning the location of 
the museum, he took off at a run. 

It was evident that at some 
THE IMMORTALS 



period in the past the town had 
gone through a surge of prosperity, 
for there were several quite ma- 
jestic buildings whose cornerstones 
bore dates of the late twentieth 
century. But it was also clear that 
during the last fifty years not only 
had few new enterprises been 
started but the old ones had been 
allowed to languish. The museum 
even lacked an attendant at the 
door — unless one gave this title 
to the bust of Dr. Peccary which 
stood on a pedestal just inside the 
entrance. The plaque beneath the 
bust noted that Dr. Peccary had 
given the museum to the city in 
1985 “to preserve for our immor- 
tal posterity a true picture of the 
world of mortals.” 

In the seven and a half decades 
since, however, this true picture 
had suffered badly. 

In the absence of curtains and 
draperies, and in the nudeness of 
the mannekins whose purpose 
could only have been to display 
twentieth century costumes, Stag- 
horn gained a hint as to where 
the populace got at least a part of 
the rags they wore. He didn’t 
pause to examine details, however. 
A wall directory with a faded map 
of the building had given him the 
location of the wing of twentieth 
century machines. He headed 
there at once, passing by displays 
of tractors, bulldozers, jackham- 
mers and other commonplaces be- 
fore reaching the automobiles. 

183 



There was an excellent selec- 
tion of standard and sports mod- 
els, all a uniform gray under their 
coats of dust — and all of them 
out of gas. 

After so long a time it was doubt- 
ful if any would have run anyway. 
He had simply hoped that one 
lone attendant might have kept 
one in working condition. 

In the next room, however, he 
found the reward for his effort. 
Bicycles. He chose a racing model. 

A few minutes later he was ped- 
aling rapidly northward on the dirt 
road that led to High Canyon. 

IV 



R. PECCARY could feel fin- 
gers probing at his sore head. 
A bit of damp cloth or cotton was 
pressed against his upper lip. The 
sharp odor that stabbed his nos- 
trils made him jerk his head away 
and suck in his breath. 



“Good. He’s coming around.” 

Dr. Peccary opened his eyes. 
For a few seconds faces and ob- 
jects swung around him giddily, 
but finally the environment 
achieved stability. He saw that he 
was in a log cabin, on a bunk. 
Seated in a chair beside him was 
a man whose manner could belong 
only to a doctor. Standing behind 
the doctor was the bearded man. 

“He’ll be all right,” the doctor 
said, packing bottles and probes 
into his little black bag. 



184 



Dr. Peccary sat up and touched 
the back of his head gingerly. It 
was very, very sore. He’d never 
had an illusion quite like this be- 
fore. Besides, the illusion had per- 
sisted too long. How long had he 
been out? Hours? Days? Good 
lord, had Staghorn deserted him? 

The bearded man ushered the 
doctor out, locked the door and 
came back to observe Peccary. He 
put a booted foot on the chair and 
leaned an elbow on his knee. 

“I hardly need tell you, Dr. 
Peccary,” he said, “that this is the 
happiest day of my life.” 

“But not of mine,” Peccary re- 
sponded sourly. “I doubt if you 
can make it a bit worse by telling 
me what this is all about and what 
you plan to do with me.” 

The bearded man showed sur- 
prise. “You don’t know?” 

“No! I don’t know!” Peccary 
was losing his detachment. 

The bearded man considered 
him thoughtfully. “I shouldn’t have 
let the doctor go so soon. Appar- 
ently you were hit harder than 
we thought. On the other hand 
it’s just possible, living as you 
have these last seventy years 
locked up in your palace and iso- 
lated from the rest of the world, 
that you’ve lost touch with what 
is going on.” 

“I’ve lost touch with a great 
many things. Obviously I’m a 
prisoner. How long is this going to 
last?” 



GALAXY 



“Only until my demolition 
squad is ready. Then we take you 
to your production plant where 
you produce the Y Hormone. 
There will be a gun at your back, 
of course. You know the combina- 
tion to get us safely past the au- 
tomatic guards. Ah, I’ve waited all 
my life for this! Once we’re in the 
plant, my men will do the rest.” 
“You’re going to blow it up?” 
“Absolutely!” 

?? A ND what do you gain by 
that? The formula for the 
Y Hormone still exists!” 

The bearded man laughed. 
“Yes, I can see you’ve been out 
of touch with the world. It’s been 
thirty years since the country pro- 
duced anyone capable of working 
with that formula. That’s when 
the last university closed dowfi — 
thirty years ago.” 

“That’s shocking,” said Dr. Pec- 
cary. “But my experiments showed 
conclusively that the Y Hormone 
has no deleterious effect upon in- 
telligence. I took every precau- 
tion!” 

“Nothing wrong with anyone’s 
intelligence,” said the bearded 
man, “except that no one’s under 
pressure to use it. When the fu- 
ture stretches on indefinitely, it 
gets easier and easier to put things 
off until tomorrow — even educa- 
tion — until finally it’s put off for- 
ever. There’s only one man living 
who understands that formula.” 
THE I M MORTALS 

I 



“And who is that?” 

The bearded man looked down 
at him balefully. “Yourself, Dr. 
Peccary! That’s why we’re so de- 
lighted to capture you — because 
now you’ll never use it again!” 
Peccary stared at him aghast. 
“I understand now! You mean to 
steal it. You mean to force it out 
of me and start producing the Y 
Hormone yourself!” 

This accusation resulted in a 
violent reaction from the bearded 
man. He grasped Peccary by the 
lapels of his jacket and hauled 
him to his feet. Peccary could feel 
the man’s powerful hands trem- 
bling with rage. 

“You fool! You utter imbecile! 
Don’t even yet know who we 
are?” 

Peccary was so throttled by the 
man’s clutch that he could only 
waggle his head in the negative. 
The bearded man’s face came 
close to his. 

“We’re mortals!” He flung Pec- 
cary back on the bunk contemptu- 
ously. “We accept our allotted 
span of years and call it quits. 
But during that time we live! We 
have to. It’s all the time we have!” 
He glared at Peccary a moment 
before resuming in a milder tone. 
“After we destroy your produc- 
tion plant, Dr. Peccary, we’re go- 
ing to kill you. You might as well 
know. It’s the only way to make 
certain that the formula for the Y 
Homone will never be used again.” 

185 




Then he smiled. “But take con- 
solation. With the plant destroyed 
you’d gradually get old and die 
anyway. For the brief period be- 
fore we execute you, you might 
even regain an appreciation for 
life.” He bent suddenly, gripped 
Peccary’s wrist and hauled him to 
his feet again. “In fact, you might 
have forgotten what life is. I’ll re- 
fresh your memory. Come along!” 

He dragged Peccary to the 
door, opened it and led him out- 
side. 

Peccary looked around. He 
found himself on the level floor of 
a canyon whose vertical walls rose 
high on either side He recognized 
the place at once. Often when he 
was a boy he’d come here to camp 
overnight. It had been a delight- 
ful wilderness with a year-round 
stream. 

'I ''HE canyon had changed. Some 
forty cabins like the one he’d 
been in were built in the shade 
of the southern cliff, and the can- 
yon floor was covered with green 
crops and pasture. He heard sing- 
ing, laughter. People were at work 
in the fields, children were build- 
ing rock castles at the base of the 
cliff. On a cabin porch two elderly 
men sat playing checkers. 

“The last of the mortals,” said 
the bearded man. “If there are any 
other colonies we don’t know of 
them. But when you’re gone, Dr. 
Peccary, they’ll be the first of a 

18 1 



new race! You asked earlier what 
we intended to do with the boy 
we kidnaped. There he is.” And 
he pointed toward the canyon 
wall. 

Peccary looked and saw Paul 
climbing upward along crevices 
and ledges. The bearded man 
cupped his hands to his mouth and 
shouted. “Paul! How is it?” 

The boy straightened on a 
rocky pinnacle and looked back. 
His face was ecstatic. “I’m climb- 
ing!” he crowed. “I’ve never been 
so high! I’m climbing all the way 
to the top!” He waved and clam- 
bered on. 

“Once in a great while a child 
is born to one of the immortals,” 
the bearded man said. “If we find 
him in time we can save him.” 

Peccary watched the boy move 
upward along the cliff. ‘Then why 
was he so terrified when you cap- 
tured him?” 

“Because he’d had it pounded 
into him that if the Atavars got him 
he’d die. He will, too, eventually. 
Like any other mortal. But in the 
meanwhile — ” He broke off and 
turned on Peccary savagely. “You 
see, there’s one thing you didn’t 
consider at all! The Y Hormone 
stops aging and keeps people 
healthy, but it can’t protect them 
from accidents. The immortals can 
still die if they get hit by a train 
or fall overboard in the middle of 
the ocean. A mortal can accept the 
possibility of accidental death be- 



cause he knows he’s going to die 
anyway sooner or later, but can’t 
you see the psychological shock 
to the immortals when one of 
them dies? A man who had the 
potential of living forever, sudden- 
ly wiped out! It’s like the end of 
the world. And so they started 
eliminating hazards. Automobiles 
went first. Then planes and trains. 
They weren’t needed anyway, be- 
cause people stopped traveling. To 
travel is to court accident. But one 
precaution breeds another, and be- 
fore long people were avoiding all 
dangerous occupations. With im- 
mortality at stake, even the small- 
est risk was too much. Planing 
mills, machine shops, mines, smel- 
ters — bah! Name me an occupa- 
tion that doesn’t occasionally 
entail some hazard. Even mother- 
hood!” 

uDUT I anticipated the need 
for birth control! I had the 
plans all set up.” 

“There was birth control all 
right, but not the way you planned 
it. Ten years after your hormone 
went on the market the world had 
an extra five billion people. For a 
few years they produced a surge 
of energy until the older immor- 
tals started eliminating the haz- 
ards. After that, starvation set in. 
Three-fourths of the population 
died. Your hormone can’t keep 
people from starving, either, and 
it was a shock from which those 
GALAXY 



IRS 



who survived never recovered. 
Every new mouth to feed was a 
threat. Childbirth practically 
stopped. But that left the remain- 
ing immortals in a very soft posi- 
tion. For years now they’ve been 
existing on the leftovers from civ- 
ilization, finding shelter in the old 
houses, ransacking the attics and 
closets of the dead for scraps of 
clothing, daring to plant a few 
crops in areas where they’ll grow 
with little care. And after that — 
boredom.” 

He thrust an , accusing finger at 
Peccary. “And you dared to use 
the slogan, ‘Time to achieve per- 
fection!’ I tell you, Dr. Peccary, 
the source of man’s courage and 
energy is the knowledge of death! 
Man was meant to be mortal. We 
strive because we know the time 
is short. We climb mountains, 
make love, descend to the depths 
of the sea and reach for the 
stars because the certainty of death 
urges us on. It’s the only certainty 
the world had — and you would 
destroy it!” 

Peccary quailed before the 
bearded man’s ferocity. He was 
relieved when his captor’s atten- 
tion was diverted by a party of 
horsemen who rode up in neat 
order and stopped before their 
leader. Several horses were loaded 
with explosives. 

“We’re ready, Sir,” their spokes- 
man said. 

“Good,” said the bearded man. 
THE IMMORTALS' 



“I see no reason to delay an in- 
stant.” 

An extra horse had been pro- 
vided for Dr. Peccary. He was on 
the point of being forcibly hoisted 
into the saddle when he was given 
a reprieve by a diversion of an- 
other kind. 

Approaching on the path through 
the center of the canyon, pedaling 
his bicycle frantically, came — 
Staghorn! 

H E rode up to the group and 
leapt from his seat, his face 
blue from exertion. He’d been 
climbing all the way from town. 
He stood gasping for breath while 
he dragged his big gold watch 
from his pocket and consulted the 
time. He managed a groan. “Only 
thirty minutes left. Miles to go! 
But it’s down hill all the way; 
we can make it!” He shoved his 
bicycle forward. “On the handle- 
bars, Dr. Peccary, quick!” 

Peccary would have liked noth- 
ing better. But his movement 
toward Staghorn was stopped in- 
stantly by the men who were try- 
ing to put him on his horse. 
“They’re going to kill me!” he 
cried. “They’re going to blow up 
my factory and kill me!” 

“No, no!” said Staghorn. “That 
can’t be. The consequences would 
be disastrous.” He turned to the 
bearded leader. “Look, Sir, I have 
no time to explain, and I’m sure 
you wouldn’t believe me even if 



189 



I did. All of you are illusions! 
This entire situation is nothing 
but a mathematical probability. 
And so I insist that you release 
my friend, Dr. Peccary, at once!” 
The bearded man was so amazed 
by this request that he forgot to 
take offense. He gaped at Stag- 
horn. “Who are you? I can’t im- 
agine an immortal risking himself 
on a bicycle!” 

“At this moment I’m desperate- 
ly mortal, and so is Dr. Peccary!” 
“Nonsense. Dr. Peccary is a 
hundred and forty-two years old!” 
“I’ve told you this situation has 
no existence in reality!” 

The bearded man stomped the 
ground. “I’ve been living on this 
planet fifty-five years. I know 
reality when I see it! And what’s 
more, I’m beginning to think you 
are one of the immortals. Even 
an immortal might show some 
courage when he knows he’s going 
to be deprived .of the Y Hormone.” 
“If you must know, I’m Dr. 
Roger Staghorn! I can see that 
there’s industry and education in 
this canyon and so it’s possible 
you’ve heard of me. I have quite 
a record of scientific achievements 
back in the twentieth century.” 

A T this announcement the 
bearded man goggled at him, 
then threw back his head and 
laughed uproariously. “You couldn’t 
have picked a worse masquerade. 
Dr. Roger Staghorn died in 1994!” 



“I can’t help that. I’m Stag- 
horn!” 

The bearded man stopped laugh- 
ing and thrust his face forward 
threateningly. “You’re a fraud! 
Because it so happens that I’m 
Staghorn!” 

“You? Staghorn?” 

“I’m Henry Staghorn, great- 
grandson of the real Dr. Roger 
Staghorn!” 

“Impossible. I have no intention 
of ever getting married!” 

“Dr. Roger Staghorn married 
when he founded the Atavars, 
ninety years ago! He saw the need 
of leaving mortal offspring and 
sacrificed himself to that end. And 
he’s buried in the cliff over there. 
Furthermore, he became Dr. Pec- 
cary’s most bitter enemy. If he 
were alive today, he’d be tying the 
knot for Peccary’s neck instead of 
trying to rescue him.” The beard- 
ed man drew a revolver from in- 
side his jacket. “I think I’ll execute 
you here and now!” 

Peccary all but fainted. If Stag- 
horn were killed all hope was 
gone. But Staghorn threw up a 
commanding hand. 

“Stop, Henry! What you say 
may be perfectly true from your 
peculiar viewpoint. But I’m still 
Roger Staghorn! Are you going to 
shoot your own great-grand- 
father?” 

Staghorn’s tone, rather than his 
words, made the bearded man 
pause. He turned to a companion.

And in that instant Staghorn 
moved. After all, he was slightly 
younger and more agile than his 
great-grandson. He leapt onto his 
bicycle, shouting at Peccary, “Turn 
around!” 

Peccary whirled and sprang in 
the air as Staghorn aimed the bi- 
cycle between his legs. He landed 
neatly on the handlebars, and with 
simultaneous kicks sent the men 
on either side sprawling. Then he 
and Staghorn were off down the 
canyon. 

Behind them they could hear 
the thundering hoofs as the horse- 
men started in pursuit. 

"Go, Staghorn, go!” Peccary 
shouted. 

The race would have been lost 
at once except for the downhill 
grade. But because of it, Peccary’s 
added weight was a help instead 
of a hindrance. Shots rang out; 
bullets bounced from the rocks on 
either side. 

They made it out of the can- 
yon’s mouth and the grade in- 
creased on the long straightaway 
toward town. Staghorn’s feet spun 
as they darted downward, main- 
taining their lead in front of the 
pursuing horsemen. The town 
loomed ahead of them, closer and 
closer until at last they sped into 
a street where the buildings gave 
them protection from bullets. 

The bicycle slowed. They were 
on level ground again. Staghorn 
skidded around a corner and 



stopped so suddenly that Dr. Pec- 
cary was propelled forward and 
landed on his feet at the mouth 
of an alley. Abandoning the bi- 
cycle, both men charged into it. 

“The square!” Staghorn gasped. 
“I’m focused on the square!”. He 
hauled out his watch as he ran. 
Only seven minutes remained. 

r T , HE deep-throated alarm 
whistle was sounding over the 
town. Its inhabitants must have 
sighted the approach of the Ata- 
vars for they were scurrying into 
buildings and basements, leaving 
the way clear for Peccary and 
Staghorn. They emerged from the 
alley and turned left for a block, 
then doubled back as they were 
sighted by the searching horse- 
men. 

The hue and cry was on again, 
but Peccary’s familiarity with his 
home town served them well until 
they came within sight of the 
square. Then they stopped in dis- 
may and ducked into a doorway. 

Across the street in the center 
of the little park, as though divin- 
ing that it must be their destina- 
tion, was Staghorn’s great-grandson 
and three of his men. Their posi- 
tion enabled them to watch all 
four approaches to the square at 
the same time. 

Staghorn tugged out his watch 
again. Two minutes. They had to 
be in focus! A second late and 
they’d be locked forever. He 

191 



THE IMMORTALS 



watched the second hand creep 
around the dial. 

“We have to chance it,” he said. 
‘When I start running, run with 
me!” 

The second hand crept on. A 
minute left. Staghorn judged the 
distance from their hiding place 
to the grassy plot where the 
bearded man was standing. About 
seventy-five yards. Could he do 
seventy-five yards in ten seconds? 
Could Peccary? Thirty seconds 
left . twenty-five . twenty. 
He’d never gone through such a 
painful count-down . fifteen 
seconds 

“Ready, Dr. Peccary. It’s now 
or never.” 

Thirteen . tweleve . eleven 
. “Go!” 

Staghorn burst from his hiding 
place with Peccary at his heels. 
They dashed for the square. They 
were over the curb and into the 
street before the men in the park 
saw their approach and let out 
cries of triumph. 

“Dip and weave, Dr. Peccary! 
Dip and weave!” 

They dipped and wove, while 
bullets ripped at their clothing. 
They were running right into the 
fire, making better targets at every 
stride. Staghorn ran with his watch 
in his hand, and never had time 
and distance diminished so slow- 
ly- 

Seven seconds, six, five, and 
they were still alive and across 
192 



the street. Four seconds, three, 
two. 

They were over the park 
and onto the grass. A bullet 
crashed into Staghorn’s leg and he 
fell, diving forward. 

“Got him!” cried his great- 
grandson. “Now get Peccary!” 

npHREE shots rang out as one. 

But at some point in the bul- 
lets’ flight toward Peccary and 
Staghorn, the square and every- 
thing in it vanished. 

Staghorn found himself sitting 
in Humanac’s transmitter unit. 

The time clock had functioned. 
He was disengaged. 

He lifted the helmet from his 
head and stumbled from the cell, 
drawing a trouser leg up to ex- 
amine his leg. It seemed that he 
could detect a scar. Then he 
turned and helped Dr. Peccary 
from the other transmitter. Both 
men stepped toward the console 
to look at Humanac’s screen. 

It was still focused on the little 
park. The bearded man and his 
companions were now exchanging 
glances of consternation. After a 
moment the bearded man wet his 
lips. “Maybe he was right,” he 
said in awed tones. “No one but 
my great-grandfather could ever 
do a trick like that. And maybe 
what he said is true. It’s all illu- 
sion. We’re nothing but mathe- 
matical probabilities!” 

At this point Staghorn hauled 
GALAXY 



down the master switch. The 
screen went dead as Humanac’s 
power was shut off. 

Some twenty minutes later he 
had finished draining Dr. Peccary’s 
sample of the Y Hormone from 
Humanac’s analyzer and had thor- 
oughly cleansed the computer of 
any last traces of it. He handed 
the little bottle of the hormone 
back to Dr. Peccary. 

“There,” he said. “As far as Hu- 
manac is concerned, it’s as though 
it never was. Do as you wish.” 
Dr. Peccary looked at the bottle 



sadly. It was worth millions. Bil- 
lions. 

Then slowly he moved to a 
laboratory sink and poured the 
contents of the bottle down the 
drain. 

“I can’t help wondering,” mused 
Staghorn, “of whose computer 
we’re a part right now — slight 
factors in the chain of causation 
that started God knows when and 
will end . .” 

“When someone pulls the 
switch,” said Dr. Peccary.

FORECAST 

The next issue, like this one you have in your hands, looks like a 
peach, a pip, a corker, a — how about leaving the superlatives to Mad Ave 
and saying it's another darned good issue? 

Among the novelets are: 

FIGHTING SPIRIT by Daniel F. Galouye, who has never left the field 
and we hope never will. Blurb: "Space combat was what I'd been trained for. 
I had wangled the job. Now all I had to do was find out what I was supposed 
to combat." No superlatives, remember, but it's not easy — the story behind 
that blurb is really taut. 

Then there's THE WRONG WORLD by J. T. McIntosh, who also hasn't 
been a stray. Say "Oops, sorry" to a planet that has been conquered by 
mistake? No, find a diplomatic formula — meaning justify conquest — or else! 

And H. B. Fyfe, who has been away far too long, returns with ROUND- 
AND-ROUND TRIP, a James Thurber kind of story, as can be noted from the 
following: “All he wanted to do was go from here to there — but somehow 
the entire Milky Way had been converted into a squirrel cage." 

Short stories, certainly, and possibly another novelet, perhaps a short- 
short . 

And Willy Ley adds THE MOON WORM to our regular features. It's a 
weird one, right enough. Downright hard to believe, but true, every word 
of it. 

See you next issue?
