THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

P. O. Zone Stab 



Kangaroo Court 



By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



Illustrated by WOOD 



Blake’s future was dark. He had murdered 



his friend — his life was forfeit — and now 



he had to break the news to the corpse! 

I trying to relieve the roaring 

fuzziness. 

T EMPLES pounding from But he was unable to dis- 
the aftereffects of too pel the nauseating impression 
many B-jolts, Greg Blake that the ship was under way, 
^hauled himself groggily out of rather than sitting on its pad 
the bunk. He shook his head, at Spaceport. 






What a hell of a charge- 
over! 

He cast about in his memory 
for details of the night before. 
But he could only remember 
up to the third or fourth pleas- 
ure spot. After that there was 
a stubborn blankness, broken 
only by an isolated recollection 
of “just one more binge-jolt 
for the orbit.” 

“Art,” he mumbled, heading 
forward along the passage- 
way. 

There was no answer from 
his partner. 

He rubber-legged it past the 
hatch, noticing it was secure- 
ly dogged and accepting that 
as evidence that Thorman 
must be somewhere aboard. 

More fully in control now, 
he was aware of the intrusive 
thoughts festering in his head, 
ridiculing his charge-over. 

Boy , he sure tied one on! 
(That one evidently from a 
tracker in Operations Block- 
house.) 

(Suggestion of subvocal 
laughter from the Administra- 
tion Section.) 7 would too if I 
had been in on their strike. 

Imagine — two prospectors 
staking out a whole swarm of 
kitarium! 

Straighten up, Blake. How 
about a few more B-jolts? 
(That bit of derision from a 
ground crewman.) 

The buzzsaw of impinging 
thoughts whined away on the 
communicative level of Greg’s 
consciousness. In the distance 
was a seething backdrop of 

8 



telepathic reflection and con- 
versation. It rose like an efflu- 
vium from teeming Spaceport 
City. It was a grating whisper 
of many confusing voices that 
could never be shut out. It was 
a blazing spotlight, forever 
obliterating all the shadows of 
privacy. 

In contrast to the fishbowl 
life and its mental pandemo- 
nium, he was convinced that 
the isolation of prospecting 
was Utopia. 

At the base of the compan- 
ionway his foot struck a small 
object and sent it skittering 
across the deck. He stooped to 
retrieve it. A hand blaster. He 
stood there fretting over its 
half exhausted chamber. 

As he entered the control 
room he drew back. 

The blaster slipped from his 
hand. In an instant his charge- 
over was gone. 

Art Thorman lay there, 
dead, with his left shoulder 
and half of his head burned 
away. 

ND I guess I told him 
off, Maud. He — (Abrupt 
astonishment.) Dead? Who? 
Where? 

Killed? With a blaster? 
How? 

Did you get that, Walker t 
Where’ d it come from? 

Over on Pad Eleven. That 
Blake fellow. It’s sifting 
through spottily. 

Blake? 

The prospector. His partner 
got burned down. 

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 





You mean — -fatally ? 

Sure. Ain’t you reading? 
Oh, Maud! It’s horrible! 
Not a — murder? (Almost 
hopefully.) 

Must be. A guy can’t burn 
half his own head off and then 
toss the blaster out where 
Blake found it. 

Greg stood staring down at 
Thorman’s body. The intrusive 
undercurrent of thought and 
paraspeech was like a far- 
away tide of anxious voices. 

A RT, dead. A victim of vio- 
lence. It was almost in- 
comprehensible! 

He had heard of crime be- 
fore. There was that incident 
across the cluster thirty years 
ago, when a man had taken his 
wife’s life on a space yacht — 
despite the consequences he 
would have to (and did) face 
when he got within the tele- 
pathic range of others. 

But this was something else. 
It was vividly personal and 
horribly close to home. And 
that only made it all seem all 
the more unreal. 

He could sense the wave of 
shocked attention that was 
traversing Spaceport City. 
And, in its wake, a deluge of 
discordant, demanding voices 
descended upon him. 

You killed him, Blake! 
“No!” he protested, not 
realizing that he was vocaliz- 
ing. “I couldn’t have!” 

It’s your blaster, an anony- 
mous accuser pointed out. 
“But that doesn’t mean — ” 



The hatch is dogged shut. 
You saw that yourself fust a 
few minutes ago. 

There’s nobody else in the 

“Why would I kill Thor- 
man? He was my friend!” His 
eyes remained on Art’s body. 

Most of the city had quiet- 
ed down to listen. 

You touched down here a 
week ago and filed claim on a 
sizable kitarium strike in 
Hound’s Tooth Nebula, some- 
one reminded. That made you 
and Thorman rich. Now you’re 
twice as rich. 

“But I’d have known I 
couldn't get away with a — 
crime !" 

Nobody else could have done 
it, Blake, a new accuser blared 
out. 

Greg shrank away before 
the ruthless speed of justice in 
an empathic society. Once, 
these things took inexorable 
time. But now suspicion, in- 
dictment, trial, verdict and ex- 
ecution could all be carried out 
in minutes. 

“If I had killed him I’d re- 
member it!” 

You were in a charged-up 
stupor. 

That’s why we didn’t have a 
chance to stop you. 

Completely unpremeditated. 

Or maybe at the last minute 
you did intend to kill him. 

Whether he wanted to or not 
isn’t the issue. 

The fact is that he murder- 
ed his partner. 

And he’s got to pay. 



KANGAROO COURT 



9 




L lKEf thunder rumbling 
against distant hills, accu- 
sation and threat churned the 
psychic background. They 
were a counterpoint to the di- 
rect inquisition. The prosecu- 
tion was rushing ahead with 
ruthless speed. 

Dismayed, Greg turned to 
run. But the compelling force 
of a thousand imperious, 
soundless voices shackled him 
where he stood. 

A life for a life. 

The gun, Blake — pick it up. 
The punishment must fit the 
crime. 

There was an overpowering 
indignation in the expressions 
of communal conscience that 
overrode his own awareness 
and left him without will. He 
groped along the deck and 
found the blaster. Then he 
swung its barrel toward his 
temple. 

THIS IS THE MONITOR 
OF THE CONSENSUS. 

The silent words, magnified 
by a psycho-amplifier, explod- 
ed like a giant’s bellow. They 
commanded stark silence. 

IT IS YOUR PRIVILEGE 
TO EXECUTE GREGORY 
BLAKE NOW OR TO DEFER 
JUDGMENT. THE SOCIAL 
CONSCIENCE WILL AS- 
SERT ITSELF IN THE END. 
HOWEVER, THERE ARE 
SEVERAL MITIGATING 
CIRCUMSTANCES, AS I 
SEE IT. SINCE HE HAS NO 
MEMORY OF THE CRIME, 
WE HAVE TO CONCEDE 
THE EVIDENCE IS WHAT 

10 



ONCE WAS REFERRED TO 
AS CIRCUMSTANTIAL. 

I’LL ADMIT GUILT IS 
OVERWHELMINGLY INDI- 
CATED. THE MURDER 
TAKES PLACE IN A SHIP 
WHOSE HATCH IS DOG- 
GED ON THE INSIDE. 
THERE ARE ONLY TWO 
MEN ABOARD. THE WEAP- 
ON THAT KILLED THE 
VICTIM BELONGS TO THE 
SUSPECT. 

What further proof do we — 

Quiet! The Monitor is 
speaking! 

STILL, I DON’T SEE 
WHERE JUSTICE IS 
SERVED IF BLAKE IS EX- 
ECUTED WITHOUT BEING 
CONVINCED OF HIS 
GUILT. 

Thousands of determined 
voices rose in protest. But, in 
deference to the Monitor, the 
greater psychic background 
reflected only indecision. 

THEREFORE I RECOM- 
MEND OUR VERDICT BE 
HELD UNDER STUDY UN- 
TIL WE ESTABLISH THE 
SUBJECT’S CULPABILITY 
BEYOND A DOUBT. 



II 

HE toneless voices stayed 
with Greg — admonishing, 
taunting, accusing, demanding 
to know whether his lack of 
knowledge of the crime was 
the result of a charged-up stu- 
por or some unprecedented 
scheme to escape punishment. 

Greg was a lean, serious 

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 





person with a straightforward 
face and a slightly receding 
hairline. That he could have 
murdered Art Thorman, his 
closest friend for more than a 
decade, was inconceivable to 
him. 

The hell it is! challenged a 
nearby tormentor. You did it 
and you probably know you 
did. 

Lay off, Marl. Give him a 
chance, like the Monitor says. 

Greg waited until the cre- 
mator’s apprentice arrived 
before he left the ship. By 
skip- jump relay through sym- 
pathetic minds, he had located 
the crematorium, out of tele- 
pathic range on the other side 
of the city, and had himself 
arranged for the final conven- 
tion, knowing that Art had no 
relatives. 

Passing through Spaceport 
Lounge on his way to the 
Monitor’s office, he shrank be- 
fore the heavy incrimination 
and denunciation that assault- 
ed him from all sides. At the 
transit platform, he engaged 
an air car whose driver was 
an elderly man with a broad 
expanse of glistening scalp. 

As soon as they were air- 
borne, the latter offered, I 
don't think you did it. 

"Thanks,” Greg said with- 
out enthusiasm. 

The driver, too, switched to 
vocalization : “Edna, she’s my 
wife — ” but Greg had already 
ascertained the relationship 
from the other’s mind — “she 
says, ‘You can bet he’s guilty.’ 

KANGAROO COURT 



But you take little Algernon 
now. That’s my boy. He’s a 
good judge of character, even 
though he ain’t got his com- 
plete telepathic faculty yet. 
He says — ” 

Greg? 

Recognizing the identity be- 
hind the tentative contact, 
Greg tensed. Yes, Virgil. 
What do you want? 

I want to help . 

You never wanted to help 
before. 

But you’re in a jam! Maybe 
there’s something I can do for 
you now. 

Greg sensed the driver’s 
discovery of the telepathic ex- 
change between himself and 
Virgil Blake. And he felt the 
man politely turning his at- 
tention elsewhere. 

I know I haven’t been an 
ideal brother, Greg. But that 
might be as much the result 
of your own hot-headedness 
as of my possessiveness and 
domination. 

Sure. You always wanted 
everything I had — from Es- 
trella on down. 

Let’s forget her. She isn’t 
even in the picture any 
longer. 

No, Greg told himself. Vir- 
gil had gotten tired of her 
after he proved he could step 
in and take over. 

That bit of resentful reflec- 
tion didn’t get by Virgil. May- 
be it was because you were 
always so damned independ- 
ent that I acted that way. 

And Greg detected nothing 

11 




in his brother’s conscious that 
indicated other than wounded 
pride as the basis of his past 
hostility. 

B ENEATH the car, the pol- 
ished-chrome expanse of 
Spaceport City glittered in 
the brilliance of its system’s 
twin suns. Down there were 
millions who, though at the 
moment preoccupied, were 
vigilantly anticipating the 
time when they might jump 
in on the kill — in the name of 
righteous vengeance. 

That’s why I want to help, 
Greg. I’m a psychiatrist. 

I know. One of the top pro- 
fessionalists in the system. 
But they won’t let you do any- 
thing to block justice. 

Indeed we won’t! came an 
obtrusive thought. We’ll see 
to that! 

You’re damned right we 
will! echoed a chorus. 

Greg ignored the pointed 
interruptions. What’s your 
proposition, Virgil? 

I don’t think B- jolts can 
produce so severe an intoxica- 
tion that a man will have no 
memory at all of what he does 
— especially if violent death 
is concerned. 

So? 

I suspect either subcon- 
scious repression or induced 
amnesia. 

Induced amnesia? 

Yes. And if that’s the an- 
swer, it means somebody else 
is involved. 

What do you suggest? 



Psychoanalytic exploration. 
Seeing whether you’re uncon- 
sciously holding anything 
back. 

Again, Greg searched the 
other’s mind for ulterior mo- 
tive. Why should a brother, 
with whom he hadn’t even 
had telepathic contact in fif- 
teen years, suddenly be over- 
flowing with solicitude? 

Instantly, he detected Vir- 
gil’s pang of aggrieved reac- 
tion. 

It was a genuine emotion 
that carried heartfelt regret 
for the years he had neglected 
his younger brother. It was 
a discovery in the nakedness 
of Virgil’s mind that made 
Greg feel warm and grateful. 

I don’t blame you for being 
suspicious, kid. Virgil mag- 
nanimously dismissed the mis- 
giving. When do we start? 

The other’s thoughts were 
becoming weaker as the air 
car sped on toward Adminis- 
tration Plaza. Virgil was rap- 
idly slipping out of normal 
telepathic range. 

I’ll get in skip-jump con- 
tact with you first thing in 
the morning. And, Virgil — if 
I’m repressing the memory of 
a horrible crime, I want that 
to come out too. I don’t want 
you trying to hide it to save 
me. 

I couldn’t, kid. If I estab- 
lished anything like that, the 
first person to read me after- 
ward would know it. 

That’s good. If I killed Art, 
intentionally or even acciden- 



12 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




tally, I deserve everything 
that’s coming to me. He was 
that kind of a guy. 

The luxuriantly landscaped 
Administration Plaza achiev- 
ed picturesque definition as it 
surged up to meet the de- 
scending car. Surrounded by 
towering, steel buildings, the 
park and its complex of offi- 
cial edifices were things of 
unadorned beauty, devoid of 
harsh inscription and direc- 
tional signs. 

In range of the various 
buildings’ psychocasters, Greg 
began receiving subtle im- 
pressions of identity, volun- 
teered items of information 
and instruction. 

These are the offices of the 
Monitor of the Consensus, 
softly intoned a slender, 
graceful structure north of a 
sparkling pool, the whisper 
of recorded thought purring 
pleasantly into his receptive 
mind. 

He concentrated on the 
building and its psycho-emis- 
sions and was rewarded, in 
due time, with the rest of the 
information he sought: 

. office of the First As- 
sistant Monitor is situated on 
the Twelfth Level. The Mon- 
itor himself will be found on 
the Sixteenth Level, South 
Wing. 

Reading the destination 
from his passenger’s reflec- 
tions, the driver swerved his 
car abruptly and put it down 
on its air cushion in front of 
the main entrance. 



G REG got out, watched the 
car slip away, then re- 
garded the building before 
him. 

Get on with it! someone 
prompted. 

You’re wasting our time 
too! another watcher re- 
proached. 

Let’s find out if you’re 

guilty! 

Instantly, a myriad offen- 
sive, prodding voices were 
welling up in his conscious. 

“All right!” he shouted. 
“I’m going!” 

He started across the ter- 
race, his concentration falling 
back to the scene of violent 
death in the ship and punish- 
ing himself for not being able 
to remember what had hap- 
pened. Then, suddenly he felt 
as though he were betraying 
himself by admitting that, 
through some weird circum- 
stance, he might have killed 
Thorman. 

Of course he couldn’t have 
done it ! He was a fool to stay 
here and subject himself to 
indignity and unjust inquisi- 
tion, The moment he found 
Art’s body he should have 
blasted off to safety — before 
the Consensus had a chance 
to decree his execution! 

A pandemonium of outrage 
exploded on the receptive 
level of his conscious as 
knowledge of what he had 
just thought was passed from 
mind to mind with meteoric 
speed. 

He stiffened, waiting for 

13 



KANGAROO COURT 




the grip of compulsion to 
seize him. But, even though 
the Consensus was swiftly 
crystallizing into a potent 
weapon of vindictiveness, he 
remained free. 

He watched horrified, how- 
ever, as the air car he had 
just left swerved sharply 
from its thousand-foot alti- 
tude, plunged to ground level 
and hurtled directly at him. 

/ can’t stop it, Blake! came 
the desperate apology of the 
driver. It’s not me! It’s the 
Consensus! 

Greg broke and lunged for 
the building. The car streak- 
ed for him, accelerating close 
to Mach One, and he hurled 
himself to the ground. 

The cyclonic tailwash of the 
vehicle rolled him over and 
over like a dry leaf. 

Gaining altitude, it scream- 
ed around in a tight turn and 
dived once more. 

But its brakes came on 
abruptly and it shuddered to 
a halt only feet from where 
he lay. Then it drifted off, 
like a predatory beast sudden- 
ly finding its prey out of 
reach. 

Now Greg was aware of 
the furious confusion of 
voices coming to grips in the 
psychic background. 

That proves he’s guilty! 
Absolutely! 

No, it doesn’t! 

He wanted to escape! You 
read that, didn’t you? 

Might have been just a nor- 
mal fear reaction. 



My foot! 

But he still doesn’t have 
any conscious memory of the 
crime. 

Naturally. He’s repressed 
it. 

Then why would he feel an 
impulse to run? 

Subconscious motivation. 
Tubewash! 

I say kill him — now! 

No, wait. Remember what 
the Monitor — 

Launch the Monitor! It’s 
time we took matters in — 

Greg picked himself up and, 
not knowing whether he’d 
even be allowed to reach the 
Monitor’s office, pushed on in- 
to the building. 

O UTSIDE the double doors, 
the suite’s psychocaster 
gently emitted: You are now 
in front of the office of Felco 
Irwan, Monitor of the Con- 
sensus. 

He went in and was imme- 
diately confronted by a too- 
slim blonde in tight-fitting 
secretarial garb who had 
unobstrusively read his ap- 
proach. 

This way, please, she beam- 
ed politely. 

Seated behind the broad 
desk in his inner office, Felco 
Irwan was an imposing man 
with a double chin and florid 
jowls. His face was the type 
which, under less formal cir- 
cumstances, might have man- 
aged some sort of a smile for 
the occasion. 

Please be seated, Mr. Blake, 



14 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




he instructed. I’m glad to see 
you’re still alive. 

“Why?” 

Irwan respected the choice 
of oral communication. “Be- 
cause it shows our people 
know how to temper instinc- 
tive justice with an insistence 
on doing what’s right, even 
though this is our first expe- 
rience with crime.” 

“I didn’t run into much 
temperance a few minutes 
ago.” 

“You’re still around, aren’t 
you?” The Monitor did man- 
age a smile this time. 

Despite his sluggish ap- 
pearance, he was spitting out 
his words with a rapidity that 
gave Greg little chance to 
probe ahead and see what he 
was going to say next. 

In the telepathic back- 
ground, there was a patient 
silence. Those interested 
watchers within range were 
merely listening to see what 
would develop next. But their 
anxiety was like a heavy mist. 

“So I’m still alive and I’m 
here,” Greg summed up dryly. 
“What now?” 

Irwan leaned forward on 
the desk. “I received a num- 
ber of skip- jump reports on 
your contact with Virgil 
Blake. Good man. Good psy- 
chiatrist. Glad to see you’re 
going to let him work you 
over. As a matter of fact, pro- 
posing some form of psycho- 
therapy was one of the two 
reasons I asked you up here.” 

“And the other reason?” 



I’m Elar Rousted. 

And I’m Stafford Waverly. 

“They are the other rea- 
son,” the Monitor disclosed. 

Greg identified the origin 
of the two contacts as being 
in another suite of offices 
across the Plaza. 

I’m the Chief of Police, 
Ronsted expanded. 

The other added important- 
ly, And I’m the Detective. 

Confused, Greg stared at 
the Monitor but asked of all 
three, What is Police? What’s 
the Detective? 

That stumped us for a 
while too, Ronsted confessed 
while Greg began to piece to- 
gether a physical picture of 
the man from his elements of 
self-regard. 

We always thought our of- 
fices were nonfunctional, the 
Detective explained, until the 
Monitor told us we had a job 
to do. 

Greg wanted to know, 
“What’s all this got to do with 
me?” 

“Police,” the Monitor offer- 
ed, "used to be an armed force 
within a community. That 
was in pre-empathy days, 
when crime flourished in psy- 
chic privacy. It was their job 
tq protect the community 
from the criminals.” 

And the Detective was the 
official who outsmarted the 
criminal, Waverly interjected. 
After a crime was committed 
he found out how it was done, 
why and who did it. 

Greg sensed the prideful

KANGAROO COURT 




expansion of the Detective's 
chest. 

, “This, Mr. Blake,” said 
Monitor Irwan solemnly, “is 
an unusual crime. We might 
call it an anachronism. And 
it’s my judgment that primi- 
tive methods of resolution are 
warranted. I therefore as- 
signed Chief Ronsted and De- 
tective Waverly to the case.” 

You may count on my — ah 
— department, sir. And Greg 
received the impression of a 
meaningless gesture — a stiff 
hand snapping up to Ron- 
sted’s forehead. 

We’ll get our man, Waverly 
vowed. 

“The Chief and his Detec- 
tive will contact you later, 
Blake,” Irwan assured. 

Ill 

G REG managed a restful 
night. He had feared at 
first that the prying voices of 
the watchers, their ranks 
swelled by thousands with 
early evening hours of idle- 
ness, would drive him to dis- 
traction. 

As it was, for more than an 
hour they immobilized him 
with demands for details of 
the killing. But his sin- 
cere introspection was futile. 
There remained only a chron- 
ological blank between the 
height of their celebration 
the night before and his 
awakening that morning. 

Softening, the watchers 
eventually allowed him access 

16 



to the ship’s jolt bar. And 
they had no objection when he 
dialed a light soporific charge 
and took hold of the elec- 
trodes. 

After that, sleep came 
quickly. With his mental ac- 
tivity dropping to a subcon- 
scious plane, he found com- 
plete release from the tele- 
pathic pressures that had 
harassed him all day. 

Before leaving the next 
morning, he gave the interior 
of the ship a quick inspection, 
conscious of the snowballing 
presence of watchers eager to 
be tuned in while he revisited 
the scene of the murder. 

He circled wide around the 
blaster, which still lay in the 
passageway, and went on into 
the forward compartment. 
Staring at Thorman’s empty 
control chair, he realized for 
the first time what a severe 
loss Art’s death represented. 
It would be a long while be- 
fore he could restore equilib- 
rium to his until-then order- 
ly existence . even if they 
gave him the opportunity to 
try. 

A few silent commentaries 
came through: 

Hypocrite! 

Whose leg are you trying 
to pull? 

That won’t get you any 

sympathy! 

Assassin! 

Murderer! 

But, all in all, there was 
mostly a respectful silence. 

Which doesn’t mean we’re 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




going to throw you any hearts 
and flowers, someone was 
quick to point out. 

Greg opened the personal 
storage compartment under 
Thorman’s chair. He found 
nothing of value except an or- 
derly array of E-records. 

Absently he withdrew one 
of the cylinders and glanced 
at the date on its tag. It was 
only a little over a week old. 
Thorman had evidently re- 
corded his ego structure the 
day they touched down. He 
no doubt had wanted an ac- 
curate duplicate, as of that 
date, for reference and inter- 
rogation. 

Bringing the cylinder over 
to the playback unit, he slip- 
ped it into the deposit slot and 
turned on the switch. Then 
he waited while the stored 
impressions, knowledge and 
personality traits transferred 
themselves to the circuits and 
retentive cells of the replay 
“brain.” 

<«T»HIS is Arthur Cervan 
Thorman," the speaker 
hissed, “as of the Thirtieth 
Day, Seventh Month, Forty- 
three Hundred and Thirty- 
Six.” 

“Art, this is Greg.” 

Circuits in the unit eval- 
uated the greeting, matching 
it against the associative ref- 
erences in the recording, and 
came back with: “This is a 
little unusual, isn’t it — you 
playing back my personal re- 
cording?” There was no re- 

KANGAROO COURT 



sentment, only curiosity in 
the question. 

“Yes, I suppose it is.” 
“Anything wrong?” 

When there was no answer : 
“Am I out there with you?” 
“No, you’re not.” 

“I thought it was custom- 
ary to replay a recording only 
in the presence of the sub- 
ject,” Art reminded face- 
tiously. 

“You’re — dead, Art.” 

There was an abrupt inter- 
ruption in the background 
hum of the speaker. “What 
happened?” 

“You were — murdered.” 
“Impossible ! Those things 
don’t happen.” 

“It’s true.” 

“How?” 

“A meteor blaster. In the 
control compartment here.” 
“Who did it?” 

“They say I did.” 

Laughter. “Now I know 
you’re joking.” Then gravity. 
“You serious?” 

“Dead serious, Art. I’m 
sorry. I shouldn’t have come 
here with my troubles.” 

“No. That’s all right. After 
all, this is just a recording. 
No subjective appreciation. If 
it seems otherwise, it’s only 
because I took pains to make 
this an authentic duplicate. 
The murder — how did it hap- 
pen?” 

“I don’t know. I found you 
here in the control compart- 
ment. We had been out on a 
bender.” 

“When was this?” 

17 




“Night before last. On the 
sixth, a week after we touched 
down. We went out on a B- 
jolt tear.” 

“Like we promised our- 
selves we would.” 

“And I blanked out before 
the night was half over. The 
next morning I was back in 
the ship. It was locked on the 
inside. No one else was 
aboard. You were dead.” 
“Tell me everything that’s 
happened since then.” 

Greg went painstakingly 
into the details. When he fin- 
ished, the speaker said, “You 
are in a hell of a mess.” 

“It’s even worse than it 
seems. I — ” 

Gregory Blxtke. Open in the 
name of the moral code. It’s 
a Police! 

T HE hatch swung back on 
a quite small and lean, but 
erect man whose appearance 
altogether contradicted the 
physical impression Greg had 
gotten from his telepathic 
contact with Chief Ronsted. 

Every man’s got a right to 
a personalized conception of 
himself, Ronsted asserted. 
Then he jerked a thumb over 
his shoulder. This is Detec- 
tive Waverly. 

The Detective’s mouth was 
set in a grin which, Greg read 
from his mind, was character- 
istic. He was a lanky man 
with a thin nose that cleaved 
a pair of dense brows. 

Where’s the body? he asked 
anxiously. I’d like to inspect 

18 



. The crematorium! Al- 
ready? Say, isn’t that destroy- 
ing evidence? 

The Chief assured him that 
normally it wouldn’t be since, 
under the system of telepathic 
detection and communal pros- 
ecution, the content of any- 
one’s memory was considered 
sufficient evidence. He wasn’t 
quite sure, however, what spe- 
cial considerations applied in 
this ease. 

Waverly nodded densely 
and followed the Chief down 
the passageway and into the 
control compartment. 

The Detective grinned more 
broadly, drew a thin cylinder 
of what appeared to be com- 
pressed limestone from his 
pocket, knelt and began 
sketching the outline of a 
sprawled human form on the 
deck. 

You’ll have to concentrate, 
Mr. Blake, he admonished, if 
you expect me to get this sil- 
houette down accurately. 

Sure you’re doing it right? 
Chief Ronsted asked. Then, 
in an oral aside to Greg, “We 
spent half the night in the 
library, boning up on the lost 
art of detection. Like the 
Monitor said, this calls for an 
anachronistic approach.” 

Radiating an absorbed de- 
gree of intrigue, he produced 
from his pocket a circular 
magnifying glass, patently a 
museum piece. For want of a 
better object of study he 
trained it on a grease stain 
on the deck. 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




When Greg’s prevocal re- 
flection identified the spot for 
what it was, Ronsted returned 
the glass to his pocket with no 
little amount of embarrass- 
ment. 

“My purpose here, Mr. 
Blake,” he said stiffly, “is to 
ascertain whether the victim 
made any recent E-recordings 
and ... On the thirtieth? 
Good ! Where did you say . 
Oh, it’s already on the play- 
back unit!” 

Waverly’s chalk stick broke 
and he rose, his brows pinch- 
ed together as he glowered at 
Greg. That recording, sir, is 
material evidence. I hope you 
haven’t biased any of its con- 
tents by misuse. 

When he read that Greg 
hadn’t, he added an exclama- 
tion of relief : 

Splendid! 

T HE psychic medium was 
dense now with the avid 
attention of thousands who 
had hastened to tune in on the 
unprecedented scene of ap- 
plied criminology. Many of 
them, too, had evidently 
“boned up” on ancient meth- 
odology. 

Look under Blake’s finger- 
nails, someone advised. 

How about detaining every- 
one at Spaceport and grilling 
them one at a time? 

Throw a tail on the suspect. 
Don’t you think you ought 
to call in the (unconcealed 
pretentiousness) meat wagon? 
Let’s have a stakeout. 



Ask him where he ivas on 
the night of the sixth. 

Ronsted stretched his small 
frame to its full height. Quiet! 
If I don’t have order I’ll black 
out the entire area and no- 
body’ll be able to read a thing! 

There was an obedient hush 
and Greg asked, “What do 
you want with Thorman’s E- 
record?” 

“It might show where there 
were strained relations be- 
tween you and the victim.” 

“If there had been, you’d 
easily be able to read it from 
me.” 

“Let’s go in for a bit of de- 
ductive reasoning, Mr. Blake. 
The basic premise is that you 
murdered Arthur Thorman. 
Which is something we’ll have 
to prove. Assumption Num- 
ber Two” — he held up a sec- 
ond finger — “is that you’ve 
found some way to, ah, beat 
the rap, as they used to say. 

“That presupposes that 
you’ve discovered how to 
isolate a segment of your 
thought processes. If you are 
able to mentally throw a blan- 
ket over your memory of the 
murder experience, then it 
logically follows that you can 
hold back from telepathic 
scrutiny any recollection of 
trouble between you and 
Thorman that might have 
provided you with motiva- 
tion.” 

Waverly, who had gone out 
into the passageway, returned 
with Greg’s blaster. He held 
it gingerly between thumb 

19 



KANGAROO COURT 




and forefinger. The murder 
weapon! 

Fine! Ronsted commended. 
Check it for fingerprints. 

The Detective squinted at 
the gun. How do you “take” 
a fingerprint, Chief? 

Damned if I know. 

V IRGIL BLAKE’S business 
suite was an elaborate fa- 
cility in the personal services 
district. 

Greg was admitted by a 
pert young thing with tufted 
red hair. She read his iden- 
tity and blurted her reaction, 
Blake himself! The killer! 
Gol-ly, a real nova! 

Then she composed herself. 
I’m sorry, Mr. Blake. I didn’t 
realize — 

Hussy! someone nearby ob- 
served. 

She ignored the comment 
and indicated the inner door. 
Dr. Blake is expecting you. 

Greg? Virgil’s anxious 
query came through. Come 
on in. 

Were it not for Virgil’s dis- 
tantly familiar personality 
pattern, Greg doubted wheth- 
er he would have recognized 
his brother. He still had plen- 
ty of hair, but it was streaked 
with gray and there was a 
gray-mottled mustache that 
hadn’t been there before. 

Of course I’ve changed, kid. 
Fifteen years make a lot of 
difference. 

Greg gripped the other’s 
shoulders. “Good to see you 
again.” 



It’s been a long time. Too 
long for brothers. After this 
mess is settled, we’ll fix that. 

“You mean if it’s settled.” 

Virgil laughed and said 
against an inner background 
of sincerity, “You didn’t do 
it. I’m confident of that. If 
you did, there were mitigat- 
ing circumstances. You just 
aren’t the type to commit vio- 
lence.” 

Greg eased into the leather 
reclining chair. What do we 
do now? 

We could rehash old times. 
But it’s more important to get 
to work. 

He adjusted the chair to a 
more comfortable position. 
We’re going to identify those 
mitigating circumstances. 
Then everybody won’t be so 
anxious for an execution. 

Knock off the sentiment! 
came a sardonic thought. 

Let’s confine ourselves to 
the murder! someone else 
proposed. 

Golrly, give them a chance. 
It’s the first time they’ve seen 
each other in years. 

Virgil repositioned one of 
a pair of two-inch metal 
spheres that sat on small ped- 
estals on the desk. Then he 
snapped on a switch protrud- 
ing from the surface of the 
globe. 

The ever-present voices of 
the watchers were snuffed 
out. To Greg, it was as though 
he were back in the vast lone- 
liness of Hound’s Tooth Neb- 
ula without even Art Thor- 



20 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




man within telepathic range. 

“Why are you using the 
Blank-Out?” 

“Psychojamming’s stand- 
ard procedure for this kind of 
work.” 

“What’s it for?” 
“Protection of the public. 
When we dig down into the 
subconscious we sometimes 
pull out things that don’t 
make for very pleasant tele- 
pathic reception.” 

Greg shifted position in the 
chair, content with his sudden 
isolation from the imperious 
curiosity of the masses. 

From its slot in the arm 
rest, Virgil pulled an elec- 
trode that trailed a heavy, in- 
sulated wire. “Ready?” 

He touched the prong to 
Greg’s forehead and uncon- 
sciousness came immediately. 

V IRGIL was standing by 
the window, hands clasped 
rigidly behind his back, when 
Greg reopened his eyes. 

“How did it go?” 

The other exhibited a trou- 
blesome frown. “It’s difficult. 
I can’t say. I don’t know 
whether I like it or not.” 
“What did you find out?” 
“If you’re actually repress- 
ing a distasteful experience, 
you’re doing a good job of it.” 
“Why should I want to 
cover anything over?” 

“Could be the promptings 
of a guilt complex.” 

“Then it looks like I did it.” 
“I won’t say that. There 
are other aspects.” 



“Such as?” 

Virgil went back to his 
desk. “You have a vague im- 
pression of a gun discharging. 
It’s not clear whether you 
pressed the stud yourself, but 
it looks like you did.” Per- 
functorily, he snapped off the 
Blank-Out generator. 

“Well, hell! That settles it.” 
Greg rose. “I shot him.” 

Projected thoughts of the 
watchers returned instantly, 
descending like a gathering 
tempest. 

Blake shot him? 

He did it? 

Is he guilty? 

Wait a minute! Virgil’s 
nearer subvocal emission 
overrode the rest. You’re get- 
ting in on the tail end of a 
speculative conversation. Wait 
and hear what develops. Then 
let the Consensus take its 
course. 

“No, Greg,” he continued, 
switching to oral delivery. 
“You could have fired that 
blast at someone else — after 
he killed Thorman.” 

General psychic surprise 
from all directions. 

“I also found something 
else in your subconscious — an 
impression of the hatch open- 
ing and closing after you and 
Thorman returned to the ship 
on the night of the sixth. It 
could have been a valid re- 
membrance — or an halluci- 
nation. We’ll have to have 
more sessions to find out. Will 
you come back tomorrow?” 

“If I’m still around.” 



KANGAROO COURT 



21 




But Greg noticed that there 
was only confusion and un- 
certainty in the telepathic 
background. The Consensus 
was not yet taking definite di- 
rection. 

Absently, he fingered one of 
the two Blank-Out generators. 
“Who’s authorized to use 
these things?” 

“The Monitor. Medical in- 
stitutions where temporary 
suffering must be expected. 
Accident mop-up crews — so 
they can block in an injured 
person’s pain. Psychoan- 
alysts.” 

Greg stood there pensively. 

No, I’m afraid not, Virgil 
offered in response to his 
brother’s further reflection. 
Nobody could have used a 
Blank-Out to cover up his ac- 
tions during Thorman’s mur- 
der. Not unless ever since the 
crime he has kept himself in 
the sanctuary of the general- 
tor’s field so nobody could 
read his guilt. 

Greg hadn’t realized Ron- 
sted was one of the current 
watchers. He learned that 
when he heard the Chief 
emit: 

Make a note of that, Wav- 
erly. Get a list of everyone 
who has been issued a Blank- 
Out. 

Greg started purposefully 
for the door. 

But Virgil called after him, 
“I’m worried, kid. If you’re 
innocent, someone else is the 
murderer.” 

“So?” Greg didn’t bother 



to probe ahead into the 
other’s prevocal preparation. 

“Then someone’s counting 
on your prompt execution to 
square things with the Con- 
sensus. Right?” 

“I suppose so.” 

“And, if he’s still using a 
Blank-Out t o conceal h i s 
thoughts, he could at this very 
moment be plotting your ‘acci- 
dental’ death — so the public 
will consider the whole case 
settled.” 

A S SOON as Greg left the 
office, the watchers closed 
in and immobilized him while 
he stood on a high-speed pedi- 
ramp and zipped through the 
heart of the city. They picked 
his mind clean. Then, satis- 
fied that they had all the de- 
tails of the psychoanalytical 
session, they released him. 

Having long since passed 
his destination he had to 
transfer and backtrack. 

This just gets more con- 
fusing, said a discouraged 
watcher. 

We ought to execute him. 
But suppose he didn’t do it? 
He fired the blaster, didn’t 
he? 

Yes, but Dr. Blake said he 
might have fired it at the real 
murderer. 

Meteor fragments! He’s 
guilty! 

Maybe not. 

Thus, in effect, the Consen- 
sus had tied itself in a knot. 

Still, Greg could draw no 
consolation from his tempo- 



22 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




rary reprieve. For there was 
the ominous presence of an 
intractable, dedicated, opin- 
ionated segment whose brood- 
ing thoughts lurked in the 
psychic medium. They were 
already convinced of his guilt. 

And the unfortunate fact 
was that there were many 
who would be willing to have 
the malcontents take justice 
in their own hands and re- 
lieve them of the responsi- 
bility. General sentiment ran 
something like this : What the 
hell! In ancient times, didn’t 
the body politic invest its 
judicial interest in a repre- 
sentative jury of but twelve 
persons? 

The pediramp slowed and 
he got off, joining the press 
of humanity in the teeming 
central district. He tried to 
conceal his thoughts. But, 
thanks to his well-known (by 
now) personality pattern, he 
drew a constant barrage of 
curious stares and subvocal 
taunts. 

As best he could, he ignored 
them and halted before a les- 
ser building whose psycho- 
caster monotonously intoned, 
Substation of the Department 
of Legal Transfer. 

He hesitated at the en- 
trance, reassuring himself 
that he had been wrong all 
along about Virgil. 

You’re damned right you’re 
wrong about Dr. Blake! a 
passerby echoed, testily con- 
fronting him. 

Another drew up. He’s 



more than a brother. He’s the 
best friend you’ve got! 

Three or four more persons 
crowded around him. 

Damned if I’d do as much 
for you. 

He has every right to wash 
his hands. 

It isn’t every man who’d 
get involved in the mess you 
are in! 

Greg pressed past them and 
went on into the Substation. 

I want to transfer all my 
interest in Hound’s Tooth to 
my brother, he told the clerk, 
in the event I’m not around to 
enjoy it. 

The man smiled warmly. 
Now you’re doing the right 
thing by Virgil. 

IV 

B Y LATE afternoon, Greg 
had made an interesting 
discovery concerning mass at- 
tention. It was when he was 
physically isolated that psy- 
chic pressure was greatest. 

As long as he remained ful- 
ly exposed, the city seemed 
to take it for granted that 
those nearby were keeping a 
close enough eye on him. 

Throughout the afternoon, 
conjecture over his guilt had 
continued to figure promi- 
nently in all the mental eman- 
ations within range. The hos- 
tile, opinionated minority had 
gathered converts. But the 
overall Consensus was still 
far from taking definite 
shape. 



KANGAROO COURT 



23 




Mentally weary from a full 
day of constant harassment, 
he stood at the edge of a lofty 
terrace and gripped the low 
handrail as he stared down 
into the chasm and watched 
the people below. Like mi- 
crobes, they flowed along the 
pediramps and congested the 
streets. 

One of the suns had already 
set, leaving the early evening 
air with a chill. The other, 
huge and vivid, eased itself 
between distant spires and 
bathed his grim features with 
its ocher light. 

The first indication of dan- 
ger was a subtle thought that 
raised itself above the jum- 
bled background, There he is 
— by the rail. 

Greg turned. Two men, 
leaving the terrace’s pedi- 
ramp transfer station, were 
advancing toward him. 

Watch it! warned one. He’s 
reading us!' 

An elderly couple and a 
much younger man, standing 
along the rail, turned and 
came forward. 

Killer! Foul murderer! 

We’ll give him what’s com- 
ing to him! 

More than a dozen poured 
out of the building. As many 
more advanced from the op- 
posite direction along the 
handrail. Still others followed 
the first pair off the pediramp. 

We don’t want to waste any 
time! someone exhorted. 
We’ve got a sub-Consensus. 
Let’s go! 

24 



Their personality patterns 
sharply identified them as 
members of the opinionated 
minority. They fairly radiated 
unswerving dedication to his 
execution. 

Greg sidled along the rail, 
letting the metal tubing slip 
through his moist hand. 
Abruptly, he turned and ran. 

Get him! 

Don’t let him escape! 

Everybody in the back- 
ground-come on in! 

Push! 

Lock him in! 

His plodding feet were in- 
stantly sucked down in an in- 
visible mire. He stood rooted 
to the terrace’s tile surface. 

You killed Thorman! 

You found a way to keep 
from being read! 

Admit it! 

Beyond his immediate cap- 
tors, there was a tense, watch- 
ful silence throughout the 
psychic medium. Everyone 
within range had become avid 
watchers. 

In the chasm below, there 
was no motion on the streets. 
The dense shadows of the 
buildings were mottled with 
the whiteness of unturned 
faces, all anxious to witness 
the summary execution. 

I didn’t do it! he insisted. 

The hell you didn’t! 

Climb up on the railing! 

Climb! Climb! Climb! 

N OT knowing how he got 
there, Greg found himself 
precariously balanced on the 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




horizontal tubing. And the 
minority had pressed in much 
closer physically. 

Jump! 

Jump! 

Jump! 

He stood there trembling, 
feebly resisting the mass will. 

Everybody in the back- 
ground — together — push l 

But his paralysis lessened 
almost imperceptibly. 

I don’t think it’s right 
(from somewhere in the 
street blow) . 

/ don’t either. 

Jump! Jump! 

What kind of do-nothings 
are we? We going to let a 
handful decide for the Con- 
sensus ? 

We shouldn’t, should we? 

Of course not! 

Shove off, Blake! 

Leap! 

No, Blake — don’t do it! 

Everybody get with us and 
help! 

I’m not. I’m going to help 
Blake. 

Me too. I’ll do my part only 
when I know he murdered 
Thorman. 

That’s the way I feel. When 
I execute, it’s going to be as 
part of the true Consensus. 

Get down, Blake. 

No! Jump! 

Don’t do it! 

Let him alone! 

The bond of minority con- 
trol slipped away gradually 
and, eventually freed, Greg 
did a balancing act on his 
lofty perch. But he finally 

KANGAROO COURT 



managed to reach down and 
Secure a grip on the rail. 

Themselves under the pres- 
sure of direct compulsion 
mow, the self-appointed execu- 
tioners opened their ranks 
and cleared a path for the in- 
tended victim. 

Numbly, Greg slipped 
through. 

THIS IS THE MONITOR. 
TO THE UNCOMMITTED 
WATCHERS, MY COMMEN- 
DATION FOR DISCRETION 
AND RESTRAINT IN BE- 
HALF OF PRECISE JUS- 
TICE 

TO THE IMPULSIVE 
MINORITY— YOU ARE TO 
BE CONGRATULATED 
FOR INITIATIVE IN THE 
INTEREST OF THE CON- 
SENSUS, BUT CENSURED 
FOR RASHNESS AND IM- 
MATURE JUDGMENT. 

AS TEDIOUS AS THE 
WORKINGS OF JUSTICE 
MAY SEEM, WE MUST 
TAKE INSPIRATION 
FROM OUR OBLIGATION 
TO SERVE PROPRIETY 
AND FAIR PLAY. 

U NABLE to shut out the 
horror of near death, Greg 
wandered about the city on 
the low-speed pediramps for 
hours. The second sun had 
long since set when finally he 
made his way back to Space- 
port. He was still unable 
to order his disorganized 
thoughts. 

In the ship, he cast himself 
on his bunk. Despite the per- 

25 




sistent curiosity of a handful 
of callous watchers he drop- 
ped swiftly into an exhausted 
sleep. 

He hadn’t slept long, 
though, when someone had 
him by the arm and was shak- 
ing him insistently. 

Wake up, Blake. 

Chief Ronsted hovered over 
the Bunk. Couldn’t contact 
you, so I figured you must be 
asleep. The hatch was open. 1 
came on in. 

Greg struggled up. What 
do you want ? He had no spe- 
cific reaction to the inevitable 
fact that the watchers were 
even now tuning in to hear 
what would transpire. 

The diminutive official 
perched on the edge of the op- 
posite bunk and leaned for- 
ward, forearms resting casu- 
ally on his knees. “Can you 
imagine what would happen if 
someone were to devise a 
way to permanently conceal 
part or all of his conscious 
thoughts?” 

Greg shrugged. “He’d buy 
himself a lot of privacy.” 

“That’s not what I mean,” 
the Chief said, annoyed. “He 
could wreck civilization ! 
There was a time when 
society monitored itself with 
cordons of armed wardens 
who apprehended criminals 
and protected the innocent.” 

“We do better than that 
row,” Greg countered.“Crime 
doesn’t even have a chance 
to take the first step.” 

“Exactly!” Ronsted agreed. 



“As a result, we haven’t need- 
ed armed protectors for a 
couple of thousand years. 
Which means there’s no pro- 
vision at all for stopping a 
criminal who could work out- 
side the ‘open mind’ frame- 
work.” 

“I see what you mean. If he 
could permanently shield part 
of his mind, he could plan and 
execute all the crimes he 
wanted to.” 

R ONSTED nodded grimly. 
You’ve got the picture. 
“But that could never hap- 
pen,” Greg said confidently. 
“Whenever your so-called cul- 
prit began conceiving of a 
way to hide his thought pro- 
cesses, his intentions would 
be read. He’d be committed 
to an institution for reorienta- 
tion.” 

The Chief pensively pinch- 
ed his chin. “Perhaps not.” 
He continued silently, On 
a prospecting jaunt, you usu- 
ally parked your ship on the 
edge of a congestion of nebu- 
lar matter. Right? 

“Why ask me? I can see 
that you already got that in- 
formation from Thorman’s El- 
record.” 

“Then you both struck out 
in different directions and set 
up collapsible bases. Frequent- 
ly you were isolated from each 
other for weeks on end, dur- 
ing which time you had 
to use radio communication. 
You were beyond telepathic 
range.”

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




“That’s right." Greg read 
what was coming next. 

Ronsted pushed on, “Dur- 
ing those periods of pure iso- 
lation you could have con- 
ceived of a way to wall off a 
section of your conscious 
mind, couldn’t you?” 

“I’d have to be a genius 
if I did.” 

“Nobody said you aren’t.” 
“That’s ridiculous ! I — ” 
“For the sake of argument, 
let’s say that while you were 
in Hound’s Tooth you did dis- 
cover a way to blank out part 
of your mind. That means you 
had several weeks to refine 
the method, to realize how 
much better off you’d be if 
you had Thorman’s share of 
the strike too . and to plan 
his murder.” 

Greg reared erect. “I’d have 
killed him out there and said 
he died accidentally !” 

“Maybe so.” Ronsted head- 
ed for the door. “But perhaps 
while you were still there you 
didn’t get any further, crim- 
inally, than making the in- 
triguing discovery that there 
was a way to outwit society. 
It’s possible that you didn’t 
conceive of killing Thorman 
until after you touched down 
here.” 

The Chief’s reasoning was 
full of holes. Greg told him 
as much as he disappeared 
down the passageway. 

But, still, the prosecution 
had made another point. The 
jury had a new element to 
mull over. 



Greg sensed Ronsted’s 
pausing in the passageway 
near the control compartment. 

I’d like to replay Thorman’s 
E-record, the Chief emitted. 

Don’t mind me. It’s only 
my ship. 

V 

A wakening long before 
sunrise-A, Greg was at 
once conscious of a restless- 
ness in the city. It was too 
early for more than a relative 
handful of the population to 
be up and about. But those 
who were tuned in were des- 
perate to get in contact with 
him. 

The silent voices descended 
like an avalanche. 

We’ve finally got you! 

Now we know you’re guilty! 
As soon as we can muster 
the Consensus, that’ll be it, 
Blake! 

Greg was off the bunk in- 
stantly. “What in hell do you 
mean!” 

You can’t hide your guilt 
any longer . 

We know all about it. 
Ronsted got Thorman’s re- 
cording to admit you two had 
a sqiuibble. 

Thorman says you even 
threatened to kill him. 

“That’s impossible!” 

See for yourself. 

The record’s still there. 

He hurried down the pas- 
sageway to the control com- 
partment. In the far corner, 
the “on” light of the playback 

27 



KANGAROO COURT 




unit burned 'faith 'a steady 
brilliance. Ronsted had left it 
on all night! 

Sorry, the Chief’s familiar 
thought pattern came through. 
/ guess I forgot. 

Apparently he was sticking 
with the case on an around- 
the-clock basis. 

Indeed I am. It’s all cleared 
up now, though— except for 
disposition by the Consensus. 
The Detective has finished his 
check of all Blank-Out hold- 
ers. All the generators were 
accounted for. Those in use 
were turned off while their 
owners were questioned tele- 
pathically. There isn’t any- 
body hiding his guilt in a 
Blank-Out field. 

Leave Thorman’s record 
alone! Greg warned. It’s the 
last one he made. I don’t want 
any of the impressions blurr- 
ed or distorted. 

“Anybody in here?” the 
playback speaker asked. 

“It’s Greg.” 

“Thought I heard someone. 
Have you been in here since 
Ronsted left?” 

“I haven’t been here since 
yesterday. Why?” 

“Somebody has. I heard 
him moving around. Stayed 
about an hour.” 

Greg glanced out the com- 
partment and down the pas- 
sageway. He could see now 
that the main hatch was still 
open. Ronsted had found it 
that way the night before and 
had left it that way. 

“Who was it?” 

28 



“I don’t know. I called out 
but he wouldn’t answer.” 

Greg finished fastening the 
clothes he had thrown on. 
“Never mind. I’ve got some- 
thing more important. Did 
you tell Ronsted we had an 
argument?” 

“I had to. He said if I didn’t 
co-operate, he’d take the re- 
cording in for micro-analy- 
sis.” 

“What did you tell him?” 
Greg was already beginning 
to feel trapped. 

“Exactly what happened. 
How you fairly flew out of 
orbit in Hound’s Tooth when 
I radioed that I was going to 
come over to your outpost for 
a couple of days.” 

Greg was thoughtfully si- 
lent. 

“I hope you understand,” 
the record continued. “Ron- 
sted would have gotten the 
information anyway in micro- 
analysis and — ” 

“What else did you tell 
him?” 

A pause. “That you threat- 
ened to kill me.” 

Greg sensed the flurry of 
anxiety in the background as 
he turned olf the playback 
unit. The steadily mounting 
number of watchers had 
greedily drunk in his conver- 
sation in the recording. 

Don’t you see? he demand- 
ed. Thorman’s E-record was 
tampered with! None of that 
stuff ever happened! 

The hell it didn’t! 

You’re lying! 

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




“How could I lie?” he 
pleaded. “You’d read the truth 
if I tried to deceive you !” 
Like Ronsted said, you 
learned how to wall off part 
of your conscious. 

It’s all over, Blake. 

All the evidence is in. 
You’re guilty. 

/ ’M INCLINED TO AGREE, 
the Monitor’s amplified 
thoughts broke in. BUT IT’S 
EARLY IN THE MORNING. 
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW 
OF US WATCHING. IF WE 
TOOK ACTION NOW, IT 
WOULD NOT BE THE 
TRUE CONSENSUS. 

Don’t you see what he did? 
someone emitted. 

He figured out a way to 
shield a section of his mind! 

OF COURSE. AND HE 
WAS STILL WORKING ON 
THE METHOD WHEN 
THORMAN GOT LONELY 
AND WANTED TO GO 
OVER AND SEE HIM. 
THAT’S WHEN BLAKE 
BLEW UP. HE HAD TO 
KEEP HIS PARTNER 
AWAY UNTIL HE PER- 
FECTED HIS SYSTEM OF 
PERSONAL BLANK-OUT. 
OTHERWISE, IF THOR- 
MAN HAD GOTTEN IN 
TELEPATHIC RANGE HE 
WOULD HAVE READ 
WHAT BLAKE If AS UP 
TO. 

“It’s not true!” Greg in- 
sisted. 

THAT’S FOR US TO DE- 
CIDE. 



Greg, listen. This time it 
was his brother. You’ve got 
to get over to my office before 
the Consensus builds up. I’ll 
meet you there. There may 
still be a chance. Pick up all 
the E-records Thorman cut 
since the beginning of the 
Hound’s Tooth trip. 

Greg started to pry behind 
the words and see what Vir- 
gil’s plan was. But the Moni- 
tor broke in again : 

LET HIM GO TO HIS 
BROTHER. IF HE REALLY 
BELIEVES HE’S INNO- 
CENT, VIRGIL BLAKE 
MAY BE ABLE TO OPEN 
HIS MIND AND LET HIM 
SEE THE TRUTH BEFORE 
HIS EXECUTION. 

Swiftly, Greg flipped the 
restorage switch on the play- 
back unit and waited until 
all the impressions and per- 
sonality features had been 
transferred back to Art’s E- 
recordL Then he snatched the 
cylinder out of the slot and 
thrust it in his pocket. 

He lunged for Thorman’s 
control seat, reaching for the 
door to the compartment be- 
neath, where the other rec- 
ords were stored. But he 
pulled his hand back instinc- 
tively. 

Something was wrong. 

Eventually he saw what it 
was. The high-tension lead 
extending from the deck to 
the control column had been 
wrenched loose and had flop- 
ped back down against the 
seat, as though someone had 



KANGAROO COURT 



29 




tripped over it and jarred it 
loose. 

If he had touched any part 
of the chair or its storage 
compartment he would have 
been electrocuted. 

What was it Virgil had 
said? “He — the real murderer 
— could at this very moment 
be plotting your ‘accidental’ 
death so the public will con- 
sider the whole case settled.” 

Knock off the intrigue! 

We see what you’re doing. 

You tvant us to believe 
somebody else is involved. 

Thorman’s recording, Greg 
reminded himself, had picked 
up a new impression during 
the night — the sound of some- 
one moving furtively about 
the compartment. Now he 
knew why. 

You’re not confusing us. 

Not any more. 

If you can wall off a section 
Of your conscious, you could 
certainly use the privacy to 
plan a fake death-trap for 
yourself. 

You want us to believe the 
Consensus is aiming at the 
wrong suspect. 

It took only a minute to re- 
connect the cable. Then Greg 
scooped up a handful of Thor- 
man’s records and lunged 
from the compartment. 

T HE door to Virgil’s suite 
was ajar, as though pur- 
posely left that way to save 
time. Reading ahead, Greg 
saw that his brother had al- 
ready arrived. 



He swept through the un- 
attended outer office and 
found Virgil bustling about 
the inner room. He had just 
snapped on the E-record play- 
back unit and was now ad- 
justing one of the Blank-Out 
generators. 

He glanced around and saw 
Greg. Thorman’s records. 
Did you — 

The generator warmed up 
to full output. Its sphere came 
alive with a soft, silvery glow, 
cutting off Virgil’s emission, 
Greg held up six cylinders. 
“These cover the past four 
months. I have the most re- 
cent one in my pocket.” 
“Good !” the other exclaim- 
ed. “Bring them over here 
and we’ll get to work.” 

Greg stepped into the com- 
pact Blank-Out field, leaving 
behind him the gathering 
psychic storm. “What are 
you going to do?” 

Virgil accepted the six cyl- 
inders. “If Thorman’s last 
record was biased with false 
impressions, then it’s possible 
that several before that one 
were modified too in order to 
build up a case against you.” 
“What if they were?” 
“Then I’ll want to examine 
them psychoanalytically. We 
might get an idea as to the 
identity of the conditioner.” 
He punched the “total 
erase” stud on the playback 
unit. A confusion of syllables 
stumbled over one another 
getting out of the speaker, as 
all the circuits and retentive 



30 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




cells purged themselves of 
lingering reflections from the 
last record. The final few 
words rumbled off almost in- 
discernibly into a bass noth- 
ingness, . use a rout-out 
. everything about it . 

Greg looked down at his 
hands. “Everybody’s convinc- 
ed I murdered Thorman. I 
don’t have very much of a 
chance.” 

“1 know that. But I think 
we can prove you’re inno- 
cent.” 

“The Monitor,” Greg went 
on, “believes I may have killed 
Art, then repressed the trau- 
matic experience. I’d like 
another session in that chair 
to see if he’s right.” 

“We’ll just be wasting 
time! Even now the Consen- 
sus could be — ” 

“I’ll take the chance. If we 
find out definitely that I’m not 
guilty, then I’ll know where 
I stand.” 

Virgil ran a hand tentative- 
ly over his face, disheveling 
his meticulously groomed 
mustache. “All right, kid. 
We’ll give it another try.” 

W HEN Greg regained con- 
sciousness, Virgil was 
staring down at him in an ex- 
pression of confused disbelief. 
“Well?” Greg prompted. 
The other backed off and 
leaned numbly against the 

dosk 

“I killed Thorman?” Greg 
guessed. 

Virgil nodded. 

KANGAROO COURT 



“But how? What hap- 
pened?” 

“It wasn’t pleasant. Both 
of you were practically out 
with B- jolts. It wasn’t pre- 
meditated, though — if that 
helps any.” 

“I want to know every- 
thing.” 

“You both came in looping. 
You stumbled around the con- 
trol compartment looking for 
the portable B-jolt bar for 
‘just one more charge.’ You 
found the meteor blaster in- 
stead. You laughed and shout- 
ed, ‘There goes one with a 
vein in it! Watch out! I’m 
going to blow it into the next 
cluster!’ ” 

“And—?” 

“You fired wildly.” 

“And hit Thorman.” 

Virgil stared at the floor. 
“It was late. Nobody was 
close enough to the ship to be 
reading you casually. You 
passed out a few seconds later 
and that was that.” 

Greg rose and paced be- 
tween the chair and the desk. 
He remembered having told 
himself at one time that if 
he’d killed Thorman he would 
welcome execution. Yet, some- 
how, at this moment the idea 
of death didn’t seem as un- 
objectionable as it had then. 

“I killed him,” he whis- 
pered. 

“But it wasn’t premeditat- 
ed, kid. Maybe the Consen- 
sus — ” 

“The Consensus operates on 
the eye-for-an-eye principle.” 

31 




He went back to the chair. 
“I repressed the memory of 
the murder?” 

Again Virgil nodded. “It 
was pretty horrible. Art Thor- 
man, your friend, with half 
his head blown off. Even as 
you slept in a B-jolt stupor, 
pangs of remorse and guilt 
were at work. It was a hell 
of a subconscious conflict. You 
wanted your punishment for 
killing Thorman. But your, 
survival instinct was strong 
too. So you repressed the 
whole thing. Compunction 
won out in the long run, how- 
ever, and even though you 
were hiding your guilt from 
yourself and everybody else, 
you were also trying to trip 
yourself up.” 

“The death-trap?” 

“Yes, the death-trap. You 
set that yourself — when it ap- 
peared for a moment that you 
might have a chance of escap- 
ing justice.” 

Greg drew erect. “But what 
about the argument on Thor- 
man’s E-record? I’m sure 
nothing like that happened!” 
“Evidently it did.” Virgil 
went over and stared out the 
window at the city coming to 
life in the first rush of morn- 
ing. “I didn’t go too deeply 
into that.” 

“But why don’t I remember 
it?” 

V IRGIL turned and faced 
him. “I don’t know what 
that was all about. But this 
much seems clear : When you 

32 



were out in Hound’s Tooth 
you had a run-in with Thor- 
man over something. Or may- 
be you were simply suffering 
from space fatigue. Whatever 
it was, you threatened to kill 
him.” 

He spread his hands in 
further explanation. “Now, 
a threat to kill is closely re- 
lated to the action of killing 
itself. It would be my guess 
that when you repressed the 
memory of killing your part- 
ner, you went a step further 
and also buried the recollec- 
tion of having at one time 
threatened him.” 

Greg dropped back in the 
chair and sat with his elbows 
on his knees. He couldn’t 
shake off the conviction that 
the watchers — millions of 
them now — were all lurking 
immediately beyond the 
Blank-Out field. When Virgil 
turned off the generator, jus- 
tice would be swift and im- 
personal . 

There was a sound at the 
door and the frazzle-haired 
secretary-assistant burst in. 
Her face lit up joyfully as she 
brought her hands together. 
“We’re going to have an ex- 
ecution!” 

Greg and Virgil exchanged 
pointed stares. 

“The Consensus just fin- 
ished jelling!” she went on. 
“Isn’t it wonderful? It’s go- 
ing to be a full-dress affair on 
Administration Plaza. And 
we’ve just declared a Grand 
Holiday!” 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




She glanced at Greg. “Gol- 
ly, Mr. Blake! Aren’t you 
thrilled?” Then her eyes dart- 
ed in Virgil’s direction. “Can 
I have the day off, Dr. Blake? 
Can I get in on the excitment 
too?” 

He muttered consent and 
she was gone. 

Greg said, “I’m not going 
to sit still for this.” 

“I don’t see anything else 
you can do.” 

“Maybe I can get out of the 
system.” He stared at the 
pair of Blank-Out generators. 

“You don’t think you can — 
escape?" 

Greg stepped closer and 
said, “Sorry.” Then he rocked 
Virgil’s head back with a blow 
that carried all his strength 
and weight. 

He lifted his brother into 
the chair and touched the elec- 
trode to his head. The light 
somnicharge would keep him 
from being read for at least 
half an hour. To make doubly 
certain, he turned on the sec- 
ond Blank-Out generator aft- 
er he had slipped the first un- 
der his tunic. 

VI 

T HE glowing silver sphere 
made only a slight bulge 
beneath his clothes as he left 
the deserted building and 
stepped into the street. It was 
a desolate scene. The city, so 
close and towering, seemed re- 
mote, lonely. Moreover, the 
hidden generator not only 

KANGAROO COURT 



jammed his own mental proc- 
esses, but also walled off the 
thoughts of the populace, add- 
ing to his sense of utter iso- 
lation. 

He rode a deserted pedi- 
ramp for a mile before reach- 
ing an air car platform with a 
driver and vehicle that some- 
how hadn’t joined the rush to 
Administration Plaza. Over- 
head, that exodus had taken 
the shape of a sky-darkening 
flight converging like the 
spokes of a wheel on the execu- 
tion site. 

The driver whirled around 
in surprise as Greg stepped up 
and touched him on the shoul- 
der. 

“Say!” the man exclaimed 
suspiciously. “How come I 
can’t read — ?” 

Greg slipped his hand in his 
pocket and gripped Thorman’s 
E-record. He thrust the cylin- 
der’s blunt end forward until 
the material of his tunic 
stretched taut under the pres- 
sure. 

“I’ve got a meteor blaster,” 
he warned. “I’m Blake.” 

“The — killer!” 

Greg forced him into the 
car. “To Spaceport. And stay 
close to the surface.” 

The trip took only a mo- 
ment. 

Even as he lunged from the 
car and raced for his ship, 
Greg could imagine the frenzy 
of communicative thought that 
must be spilling out of the 
driver’s mind. 

He slammed and dogged the 

33 




hatch and pushed on to the 
control room. For a moment, 
while the drive circuits warm- 
ed up, he vaguely wondered 
how far he would have to go 
before he found one of the 
quarantined, nontelepathic 
worlds. That’s what it would 
have to be. For, if he wound 
up in another free-reading so- 
ciety, they would only com- 
plete the kangaroo proceed- 
ings. 

Impatiently, he leaned over 
and checked the fuel gauge. 

“Damn!” he said. 

Almost empty! There was- 
n’t enough left to lift the ship 
out of the atmosphere ! 

Finally achieving operation- 
al voltage, the view screen 
flicked to life and relayed the 
picture of thousands of cars 
blotting out the sky as they 
streamed from the city to 
Spaceport. 

Dismayed, he stumbled over 
to the gear locker and got an- 
other meteor blaster, thrust- 
ing it under his belt. As long 
as he had the Blank-Out to 
avert being forced to kill him- 
self, he could hold them off — 
until the sphere’s stored power 
was completely exhausted, at 
any rate. 

He swept the ship’s scanner 
in a full circle. The entire 
Spaceport landing area was 
packed with humanity — all 
waiting for the exciting mo- 
ment when the killer would be 
routed from his sanctuary, 
somehow, and brought to jus- 
tice. 

34 



I T WAS several hours later 
that Greg rediscovered 
Thorman's E-record in his 
pocket. By now, the angry 
horde had begun valving off 
the steam of its frustration by 
pelting the ship with whatever 
they could get their hands on. 

Absently, he returned the 
cylinder to the compartment 
beneath Thorman’s chair. It 
was then that he saw the other 
record lying on the deck, half 
hidden by the high-tension 
lead. He had doubtlessly 
knocked it out of the compart- 
ment when he had snatched up 
the handful of cylinders. 

He retrieved it and glanced 
at the date on the tag — 
Twenty-third Day, Seventh 
Month. That was a week be- 
fore Thorman had cut his final 
cylinder. Greg remembered 
the occasion now. They were 
wrapping things up at Hound’s 
Tooth, getting ready to return 
home. 

He fed the cylinder into the 
playback unit and waited until 
it was ready for interrogation. 
“Art, this is Greg.” 

He had to indulge his part- 
ner’s characteristic reaction to 
finding someone else question- 
ing his own recording. But 
Greg cut it as short as he 
could. 

“Something’s come up con- 
cerning that argument we had 
at Hound’s Tooth,” he ex- 
plained. 

“Argument? What argu- 
ment?” 

“When you wanted to come 

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




over to my outpost and I told 
you to stay the hell where you 
were.” 

There was a pause, then, 
“You’re kidding, of course.” 

“The time when I threaten- 
ed to kill you.” 

Thorman’s record produced 
a laugh. “I don’t remember 
anything like that.” 

“Are you sure?” Greg back- 
ed off. 

“Of course I’m sure!” 

But there was a clear recol- 
lection of the argument on the 
recording Thorman had made 
a week later ! This, Greg real- 
ized despite his confusion, 
could only mean the later re- 
cording had been tampered 
with ! 

And, by extension, it was 
certain now that someone else 
was involved in Thorman’s 
murder. And that meant — 
what did it mean ? 

For one thing, maybe he 
hadn’t set the death-trap for 
himself as an expression of 
his guilt complex ! 

Deep, disorderly realizations 
began to swim into focus. He 
went back to Thorman’s con- 
trol seat, staring dully at the 
cable which might have elec- 
trocuted him. 

If he had unconsciously set 
the death-trap, he asked him- 
self, why would he have baited 
Thorman’ s chair? It was un- 
likely that he would have had 
any reason to blunder, un- 
knowingly, into that snare! 
His subconscious would cer- 
tainly have been more practi- 

KANGAROO COURT 



cal. He would have rigged up 
something like his bunk, or his 
own chair. 

T HE communication screen 
in the Spaceport Adminis- 
tration Office flared to life, 
limning a picture of Greg 
Blake at the controls of the 
ship. 

There he is now! thought 
the Spaceport manager in ex- 
citement. 

He’s on the air! added Chief 
Ronsted, who had been stand- 
ing vigil in the room. 

Come out of that ship, 
Blake! Monitor Irwan order- 
ed, forgetting Virgil had re- 
cently relinquished the infor- 
mation that Gregory Blake’s 
mind was being blocked off by 
a stolen Blank-Out generator. 

The screen’s audio amplifier 
hummed tentatively as Greg 
scanned the room and sighted 
Irwan. 

“I want to talk with you and 
the Chief,” he said. 

“Come out of there, Blake!” 
the Monitor repeated. 

Ronsted added, “Turn off 
the Blank-Out!” 

“And get executed for some- 
thing I didn’t do?” 

“We’ll flush you out sooner 
or later,” Irwan promised. 

Ronsted’s lean face formed 
an even leaner smile. “We’ve 
just sent to the Hall of An- 
cient Artifacts for a weapon 
that’ll blow that ship to 
pieces.” 

Greg spread his hands im- 
portunately. "All I want is a 

35 




few minutes to talk with you 
and the Monitor.” 

“Well, come on out and 
talk,” Irwan urged. 

“I wouldn’t make it past the 
hatch. You’ll have to come 
here.” 

“In your ship?” Irwan ask- 
ed in protest, fingering his 
double chin. 

Of course we’ll go there, 
Chief Ronsted beamed, with a 
tinge of amusement that didn’t 
show on his face. We’ll let him 
think we’re ivilling to go in 
and talk. 

What do you mean? the 
Monitor asked. 

He can’t read us now, not 
with that Blank-Out on. By 
going there we’ll at least get 
him to open the hatch. Then 
we’ll all rush him and grab the 
Blank-Out! 

G REG waited tensely at the 
hatch. That some develop- 
ment was imminent was indi- 
cated in the sudden silence. 
For the first time in hours, no 
missiles were pelting the ship. 

Eventually there was a hes- 
itant rapping. 

He drew the bolts and, in 
one swift motion, swung the 
hatch open and thrust the 
meteor blaster out in front of 
him. The weapon covered 
Chief Ronsted and the Monitor 
as their faces froze in expres- 
sions of frustrated surprise. 

The scores who had pressed 
in close behind them, ready to 
spring, fell back at the sight 
of the blaster. 



“I thought you’d try some- 
thing like this,” Greg disclos- 
ed. “You gave in too easy when 
I asked you over.” 

He waved them into the 
passageway, closed the hatch 
behind him and prodded them 
on into the control compart- 
ment. 

“What do you expect to gain 
by this?” Ronsted demanded. 

“Don’t you see?” the Moni- 
tor said disgustedly. “He just 
wanted a couple of hostages.” 
“Wrong.” Greg ordered 
them into the control chairs 
with a wave of the blaster. 

Then he pointed to the play- 
back unit. “I have one of Thor- 
man’s E-records in the slot. It 
was made a week before the 
one that supposedly incrimi- 
nated me.” 

“You’re wasting our time, 
Blake,” the Monitor said im- 
patiently. “If you hadn’t been 
covered by this Blank-Out field 
over the past few hours, you’d 
know your brother was con- 
tacted by thousands of us. He 
wasn’t able to hold back one 
iota of truth. We know he suc- 
ceeded in digging up all the 
information from your sub- 
conscious — how you killed 
Thorman — how — ” 

“This record,” Gregg went 
on implacably, “has no trace 
of the argument Thorman and 
I presumably had in Hound’s 
Tooth. That means the more 
recent recording, showing the 
argument, was faked.” 

“You expect us to believe 
that?” Ronsted asked. 



36 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




Irwan leaned forward. “If 
this record is as you say, then 
you made it that way.” 

“Let’s don’t get off on that 
jag again.” 

Ronsted tried to rise, glanc- 
ed at the blaster and sat down 
again. “Then why is it that 
the records you brought to 
your brother’s office this morn- 
ing contain recollections of the 
same argument?” 

Greg smiled bitterly. “I sus- 
pected they would — by now. 
He’s had plenty of time to im- 
press false knowledge on them, 
just as he did on the most re- 
cent cylinder.” 

“Blake, you’re insane!” ex- 
claimed the Chief. 

“Virgil had no Blank-Out on 
when we contacted him on his 
way here a few minutes ago,” 
Irwan argued. “If he had done 
anything like that, we’d have 
read it!” 

“You were willing to believe 
I did something like that with- 
out anyone being able to read 
it!” 

Ronsted rose. “That was 
different! You had weeks of 
total isolation in Hound’s 
Tooth to figure a way to cheat 
the communal conscience !” 

“Y 0U ’ LL find that Virgil, 
too, had all the time he 
wanted. You see, he was al- 
ways envious of me when we 
were younger. He simply de- 
cided he wanted the fortune I 
made from that kitarium 
strike. 

“In order to get it, he came 
KANGAROO COURT 



over here on the night of the 
sixth, carrying a Blank-Out 
generator. He banged on the 
ship until either Thorman or I 
let him in. He used a portable 
somnibattery to put me in a 
receptive trance. He killed 
Thorman. Then, using psycho- 
therapeutic procedure, he bur- 
ied in my subconscious the 
memory of having let him in 
the ship. There was also a 
posthypnotic suggestion to 
bolt the hatch after he left, 
and to forget that act.” 

Chief Ronsted lunged up 
too, but held his distance in 
deference to the blaster. 
“That’s ridiculous!” 

Greg waved them back into 
their chairs. “Virgil Blake 
might have made it easier on 
himself. He could have planted 
a false memory of the murder 
in my conscious mind. But, if 
he’d done that, he would have 
had no chance to play on my 
sympathy, win back my con- 
fidence — and have me legally 
arrange for the fortune to be- 
come his after my death ! 

“That was the purpose of 
my first psychoanalytical ses- 
sion — so he could plant the 
compulsion in my mind to 
think kindly of him and sign 
over my wealth. During that 
session he also planted the 
subconscious suggestion that 
I was to leave the ship’s hatch 
open that night.” 

“This," Monitor Irwan be- 
gan, “is the most preposter- 
ous — ” 

But Greg plodded on, "After 

37 




the legal transfer was effected, 
he used another Blank-Out to 
return to the open ship and set 
the death-trap. At the same 
time, he employed oral hypnot- 
ic procedure to put a false im- 
pression of the Hound’s Tooth 
argument on Thorman’s E- 
record, just in case his trap 
didn’t work. He deleted from 
the record all conscious recol- 
lection of that oral procedure. 
But he forgot to erase the im- 
pression of someone moving 
around in the control compart- 
ment. 

“I should have known he 
was the one who rigged up 
Thorman’s personal storage 
compartment with the high- 
tension charge! Wasn’t it his 
idea for me to pick up Thor- 
man’s records and bring them 
to his office ?” 

“It was,” the Chief admit- 
ted, “but that doesn’t prove — ” 

“When I got to his office he 
finally had his opportunity to 
plant a false memory of the 
crime in my subconscious — or 
at least to pretend he had 
found it there. At the same 
time he had to produce an ex- 
cuse for having asked me to 
bring Thorman’s recordings.” 

Greg leaned forward, smil- 
ing tensely. “If I’d been alert 
at the time, I might have no- 
ticed something vital: Virgil 
had to clear some residual im- 
pressions out of his playback 
unit before he could use it 
again — presumably to inspect 
Thorman’s recent records for 
clues to clear me. 

38 



“During that playback 
clear-out run, I caught a cou- 
ple of fragments of speech: 
‘. use a rout-out . every- 
thing about it . .’ If I’d been 
thinking clearly, I might have 
recognized that the words 
were Virgil’s and I might have 
realized their significance.” 

REG, kid— stop it ! You’re 

^ just making it harder on 
yourself.” 

Greg turned toward the 
communication screen, which 
he realized had been on for 
some time. It showed the in- 
terior of the Spaceport Ad- 
ministration Office. Virgil was 
in the foreground. 

“Don’t you see,” he asked, 
“that all this thrashing around 
you’re doing is nothing more 
than the guilt complex-sur- 
vival instinct conflict in your 
subconscious ?” 

“Virgil,” Greg said patron- 
izingly, “will you come over to 
the ship?” 

“I don’t see why I should. 
I’d only be endangering my 
own life.” 

Greg turned to Chief Ron- 
sted and the Monitor. “I didn’t 
think he would. He’s laboring 
under a compulsion right now. 
Something’s telling him not to 
do anything to betray him- 
self.” 

Ronsted was on his feet 
again. “Blake, you aren’t mak- 
ing any sense at all!” 

“All right,” Virgil said final- 
ly. “I’ll come over, if you think 
it’ll help any. But remember, 

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




I’ve heard all your accusa- 
tions. And I’m not in range of 
any Blank-Out. Everybody in 
Spaceport City has read those 
insinuations through me. They 
watched my reaction. They all 
know my unspoken denials 
were sincere and truthful. If I 
had tried to lie they would 
have set upon me by now.” 

Greg turned off the commu- 
nicator. “He’s going to come 
over,” he told the two officials, 
“because he subconsciously 
fears that not to come might 
eventually cast some doubt on 
his innocence. He probably has 
another purpose too — to look 
for an opportunity to kill me 
in self-defense.” 

Chief Ronsted ran a hand 
distraughtly over his thin face. 
“I’m not going to sit here 
and — ” 

“Yes, you are,” Greg said 
grimly. 

REG barely managed to get 
Virgil in the ship. 

He jerked open the hatch, 
reached out and seized his 
brother’s wrist, snatching him 
in just as several persons, flat- 
tened furtively againt the side 
of the ship, grabbed unsuc- 
cessfully for his own swiftly 
moving arm. 

As he fired a warning shot 
to clear the entranceway, he 
ducked just in time to avoid 
his brother’s lunging charge 
from behind. Then he slammed 
the hatch and dogged it. 

Virgil picked himself up off 
the deck and said, “I just 

KANGAROO COURT 



wanted to take the blaster 
away from you.” 

Greg smiled knowingly. “Of 
course you did — the blaster 
and the Blank-Out generator. 
Then the Consensus would 
take care of the rest.” 

He searched his brother’s 
face. And what he sought was 
there, hidden deep in his eyes. 
In the range of the generator 
now, Virgil had undergone a 
subtle change. He didn’t seem 
to be as aloof as before. And 
his stare was one of discern- 
ible preoccupation. 

He gave Virgil a shove and 
sent him ahead to the control 
compartment. Respecting the 
blaster, Ronsted and Irwan 
hadn’t left their chairs. 

“I bring one Virgil Blake,” 
Greg said affectedly, “forced 
here as a result of the obscure 
promptings of unconscious 
motivation. He’s already had 
his try at blasting me — in self- 
defense, of course.” 

Virgil started to say some- 
thing, but Greg motioned him 
silent with the blaster. “When 
my brother came in on the 
communication screen, I was 
saying — ” 

“But don’t you see?” the 
Monitor pleaded. “He couldn’t 
have done any of those things 
without betraying himself the 
minute anyone got in contact 
with him.” 

“That’s what I tried to tell 
Greg,” Virgil offered. But he 
was busy mopping perspira- 
tion from his face. 

“A few minutes ago in the 

39 




Spaceport office,” Greg said 
clearly, “he was telling the 
truth when he insisted there 
was no trace of guilt in his 
mind for anybody to read. But 
now he knows everything I 
said is true.” 

Virgil backed off, perspiring 
more freely. 

“As I was saying,” Greg 
continued “the playback unit 
in his office gave out with 
these fragments of speech as it 
cleared its circuits : ‘. use a 
rout-out . everything about 
it . .’ Do you know what a 
rout-out is, Monitor?” 

“Of course. It’s an electronic 
instrument for destroying all 
the impressions on an E-record 
so the cylinder can be used 
again.” 

“Exactly. Virgil’s oivn rec- 
ord was telling him to use a 
rout-out and destroy . every- 
thing that had been deposited 
on that record, then forget 
everything about it. He was 
supposed to forget even the 
fact that he had made such a 
record. That order to forget 
was to apply except when he 
found himself in the range of 
a Blank-Out, as he is now. In 
other words, whenever it was 
evident that his thoughts 
couldn’t be read, he was free 
to plot the death of Thorman, 
my incrimination and what- 
ever would be necessary to 
take over my interest in the 
Hound’s Tooth strike !” 

Monitor Irwan’s stout face 
was stiff with shock and 
amazement. 



Chief Ronsted faced Virgil 
with calculating regard. 

Virgil, his mouth hanging 
open, only stared at the blaster 
as he backed against the bulk- 
head. 

But he tensed abruptly and 
charged, his arms outstretch- 
ed to encompass Greg and hurl 
him to the deck. Greg, how- 
ever, was prepared. He side- 
stepped and brought the han- 
dle of the weapon down 
against his brother’s head. 

I T STUNNED Virgil, but 
only momentarily. Then he 
sat on the deck and buried his 
face in his hands. 

“I had a patient,” he sobbed. 
“It was the day after Greg 
and Thorman got back from 
Hound’s Tooth. The psycho- 
casts were full of stories about 
their fabulous strike. My pa- 
tient was unconscious. The 
Blank-Out was on, I thought 
then how I’d like to get Greg’s 
wealth. And, in a moment, I 
saw how it could be done. 

“I had to go through with it. 
If I had backed out then, my 
envious thoughts would have 
been read when I eventually 
turned the Blank-Out off and I 
would have been sent to an in- 
stitution for disassociation and 
reorientation. 

“I cut an E-record and put 
it on the playback. All the 
while my patient remained un- 
conscious. Then I let the re- 
cording, with my intentions an 
integral part of it, carry on 
from there.

DANIEL F, GALOUYE 




“The record used oral psy- 
choanalytical procedure. In 
effect, I hypnotized myself, 
making myself forget on a 
conscious plane that I had 
even conceived of the thought 
of killing my brother. At the 
same time I ordered myself to 
plan toward that end on a con- 
scious level only when I was in 
range of a Blank-Out gener- 
ator. I was to drop all such 
mental activity into the sub- 
conscious whenever I got out 
of its range. 

“It was a perfect setup. 
Since only the conscious mind 
can be telepathically read, my 
hands were always clean. 

“The E-record also directed 
that, consciously, I should 
think and act kindly toward 
Greg. At times I carried out 
those instructions only too well 
— such as warning him an at- 
tempt might be made on his 
life when all the while I sub- 
consciously knew that would 
happen. In other words, all the 



planning and a good deal of 
the execution was done with- 
out even the watchers or my- 
self knowing about it. 

“Even when I asked Greg to 
bring over Thorman’s records, 
I honestly thought I was try- 
ing to help him. But when he 
got there I had already turned 
a Blank-Out on and was ready 
to carry on my scheme from 
there.” 

Greg handed the meteor 
blaster to Chief Ronsted. 

The Monitor rose, shaking 
his head incredulously. “You 
stay here and keep that Blank- 
Out generator on,” he said, 
thumping the bulge under 
Greg’s tunic, “until I go out 
and let them read all that’s 
happened.” 

Greg watched him and the 
Chief disappear down the pas- 
sageway together. 

Then he knelt beside Virgil, 
placed an arm around his 
shoulder and waited.

HOW DO YOUR IDEAS GROW? 

When Vivian Kellems is hot copy, she is hot copy indeed — moving her 
manufacturing plant from New York, for instance, in protest against 
state taxes, and, in her fight to shoot down federal withholding taxes, 
making such demands that, had they been successful, would have had 
every employer compensated as a tax collector, thus ruining the with- 
holding scheme. 

In the idea field, though, Vivian Kellems is topped perhaps only by 
the item on page 84. Remember the Burmese thumb trap? Strictly kid 
stuff, it’s made of plaited straw in a cylinder shape that gets tighter the 
harder you try to yank your thumbs free. Miss Kellems saw a well-nigh 
perfect electrical connection in the gizmo; conduits and cables joined this 
way — not with straw, of course — were hooked for keeps. Her company 
turns out millions of dollars’ worth of such equipment a year, all from 
the idea behind a toy.

Warning! Don’t try to pass 
any phony zulceets — it can 
cost you everything you own !

Parallel Beans 



T HE fat announcer said 
threateningly, “ 'n I want 
to warn you that the govern- 
ment is cracking down on zul- 
ceet forging. They won’t per- 
mit our matter-transmitters 
to be mulcted by cheap zulceet 
forgers any longer. Sales via 
the zulceet slot play a vital 
role in our economic life. The 
new penalties for forging are 
strict, and will be strictly en- 
forced.” The bib around his 
pudgy neck shook indignantly. 
His piggy eyes glared. 

George switched off the TV. 
The programs from the paral- 
lel time-stream stations were 
lousy anyway. He looked at 
his wife. 

She was frowning anxious- 
ly. “Do you think they’ll at- 
tach our house? It’s a darling 
house. And we’ve made a lot 
of payments on it.” 

“I don’t see how they 
could,” George answered. His 
voice was calmer than he felt. 
“According to Herbert, they’re 
in a time-stream parallel to 
ours, so I doubt they can real- 
ly get at us, in the first place. 
Getting those beans across 
into our stream is about as 
much as they could do. And in 
the second place, a silver fifty- 
cent piece isn’t a forged zul- 
ceet. It’s legal U. S. tender. 
The whole thing’s unfair. 
Fifty cents is more than those 
beans were worth.” 

“They weren’t very good 
beans,” Nina agreed. She 
sighed. “I know Herbert 
meant well,” she said. “He 

44 



thought we’d enjoy trying the 
beans we’d been hearing 
advertised on the parallel 
time-stream stations. But 
sometimes I wish he’d never 
repaired our TV set, or in- 
stalled the zulceet slot on it, 
or put the fifty cents in the 
slot. It would have been better 
to have the regular repairman 
work on it. The ‘Notice of At- 
tachment of Domicile’ they 
sent frightens me.” 

T HERE was a thud of feet 
from the vacant lot out- 
side. The back door opened 
and, as if the mention of his 
name had evoked him, Herbert 
came bounding in. 

“Hi, sis,” he said. “D’l 
smell caramel cake, hunh? You 
got caramel cake for supper 
tonight, hunh, sis?” 

“Yes, dear,” Nina answer- 
ed, her face softening. “Would 
you like a piece?” 

“Double zorch!” Herbert 
cried joyously. He leapt to- 
ward the kitchen, with Nina 
after him. 

George glared at his back. 
When he wasn’t with his 
brother-in-law, he wondered 
why he disliked the boy so. 
That Herbert had no manners 
could be laid to his age, and 
modern education was respon- 
sible for the fact that he some- 
times spelled “cat” with a “Q.” 
On the credit side, Herbert 
was a whizz with anything 
electronic (too much of a 
whizz — his repairs to the TV 
set had started all the trou- 



MARGARET ST. CLAIR 




ble), and he got straight A’s 
in physics and math. But he 
was bumptious, officious, and 
opinionated. He told Nina 
what detergent to use, and ad- 
vised George in the choice of 
razor blades. What really 
made George loathe him was 
that he was always after 
Nina’s cakes. 

Herbert came back from the 
kitchen with a glass of milk 
and a slab of cake. “Good 
cake,” he said, swallowing. 
“Icing’s grainy, though. You 
must’ve stirred it too much, 
sis.” 

“I expect I did,” Nina 
agreed submissively. “Her- 
bert, I’m worried. Do you 
think the people in the paral- 
lel time-stream will attach our 
house?” 

“Sure,” said Herbert. “Why 
not? They sent you the notice. 
They think you forged a zul- 
ceet.” 

“But—” 

“It’s a difficulty of commu- 
nication,” replied Herbert, 
licking a crumb of caramel ic- 
ing from his face. “You ought 
to try to square things. Don’t 
want them to take over the 
house.” 

“We can’t give back the 
beans. We ate them.” 

“That’s what you ought to 
explain.” 

There was a silence. George 
looked at his wife and his 
brother-in-law. Then he went 
in the kitchen and came back 
with a can of present, non- 
parallel-time beans. He got 

PARALLEL BEANS 



paper and a pencil from the 
desk 

“What’cha going to do?” 
Herbert asked interestedly. 

“Put the beans in the zul- 
ceet slot, with a note. The 
beans are for compensation, 
and the note is to explain.” 

“Won’t work,” Herbert-said, 
in a superior voice. 

“Why not?” George de- 
manded. He was growing an- 
gry. 

“They don’t understand 
English. They’re not like us. 
They may not be human be- 
ings at all.” 

“English is what they 
speak!” 

“Naw, they don’t. Your 
mind just translates it men- 
t’lly. I bet what they talk isn’t 
any more like English than it 
is, unh, like Chinese.” 

“Nuts, the ‘Notice of At- 
tachment of Domicile’ is in 
English!” 

Herbert shrugged. “You’ll 
be sorry,” he said. 

George was too annoyed to 
answer. He finished writing 
the note, fastened it around 
the can with a rubber band, 
and put the can in the mer- 
chandise bin at the end of the 
zulceet slot. He pressed the 
lever. The can disappeared. 

T HERE was a slight pause. 

Then four green cans, 
cans of parallel time-stream 
beans, dropped out of the 
merchandise bin. 

“They’ve sent more,” said 
Nina. She laughed hysterical- 

45 




ly. “More of those same old 
lousy beans !” 

Herbert giggled. “I told you 
so,” he said. 

George managed to restrain 
himself from bashing the cans 
in Herbert’s face. “If you 
know so blasted much — ” 
There was a whuffle from 
the zulceet slot and a docu- 
ment dropped out. It was or- 
namented with purple ribbons 
and big official-looking blue 
seals. George picked it up and 
broke the seals. 

“Notice of Aggravated Of- 
fense,” he read aloud. “When- 
as the owners of videal set 
no. 37765” (the number was 
blurred) “have compounded 
their offense of zulceet forg- 
ing by a repetition of said 
offense, they are informed 
that immediate attachment of 
spouse, female sex, has been 
adjudged against them. This 
judgment is without appeal. 
Videal Intercity Authority.” 
Nina’s jaw had dropped 
down. “Spouse, female sex — 
George! Oh! That’s me!” 

“I thought something like 
this would happen,” Herbert 
observed. He took a gulp of 
milk. “Nina had better stay 
away from near the TV set.” 
“But— I don’t get it,” 
George said. He had put his 
arm around Nina and was 
holding her close to him. 

“They think your can of 
present-time beans was meant 
as another forged zulceet,” 
Herbert explained. “So they’re 
going to attach sis.” He fin- 

46 



ished the milk and put the 
glass down on the table. 
“Don’tcha worry about it,” he 
said kindly. “I’ll fix it up.” 

He rummaged through the 
pockets of his plastic jacket, 
pulled out a tiny piece of pa- 
per and a pencil, and began to 
write. 

“What are you writing?” 
George demanded. “You just 
said they don’t understand 
English.” 

“Um-hum. But mathematics 
is a universal language. I’m 
explaining in mathematical 
terms about how I came to in- 
stall the zulceet slot on the TV 
set. Once they realize we’re in 
a different time-stream from 
theirs, they’ll give up the idea 
of attaching sis or bothering 
the house.” 

He folded the paper to the 
size of a postage stamp, put it 
in the slot, and pressed the 
lever. George waited. But no 
more cans of parallel-time- 
stream beans appeared. 

“That did it,” Herbert said 
jubilantly. “Told yuh they’d 
understand math, didn’t I? 
Guess I’m pretty big deal, 
hunh, sis, pretty big d — ” 

E disappeared. 

His disappearance was 
so sudden and so complete that 
George involuntarily looked 
up at the ceiling, expecting to 
find him being drawn up 
through it. Herbert wasn’t 
there, of course, He wasn’t 
anywhere. 

Nina giggled hysterically. 

MARGARET ST. CLAIR 





The whites of her eyes were 
showing. “They’ve attached 
him,” she said. “Whu-whu- 
whu-whu ! They’ve attached 
Herbert, instead.” 

“Instead — ?” George de- 
manded blankly. He couldn’t 
seem to focus on things. 

“Attached him instead of 
me. Whu-whu-whu ! Whu, 
whu, whu, whu!” She began 
to cry. 

George put his arm around 
her. He was just getting her 
calm when there came another 
whuffle from the zulceet slot. 

This time it was neither 
beans nor another legal-look- 
ing document. It was a piece 
of paper folded up small, and 
even before he unfolded it, 
George knew who it was from. 

“They are all mixced up,” 
it began without preamble. “I 
have been here a couple of 
days now — ” George and Nina 
looked at each other ; it hadn’t 
been ten minutes yet — “and I 
am eggsplaining it to them. It 
is hard wurk. They are plenty 
dumm. A bunch squares. But 
do not wurry. I am alrighte. 
Herbt.” 

George looked up from the 
paper. “But why would they 
attach him?” he demanded. 

“Because they think he’s 
me,” said Nina. “Don’t you see 
what he says ? They’re all 
mixed up — he says so — and 
plenty dumb. Maybe they 
aren’t really human beings at 
all — we don’t really know that 
they are. Those beans tasted 
funny. Maybe they even 



thought that math paper Her- 
bert put in the slot was a 
confession of zulceet forging. 
But anyhow, they think Her- 
bert’s me. They think he’s 
your wife!” 

She began to go whu-whu- 
whu once more. Once more 
George calmed her. Though 
they discussed the disappear- 
ance over and over again, they 
could find no better explana- 
tion than the one Nina had 
advanced. When it got dark 
Nina called her mother and 
told her Herbert was staying 
with them that night. 

G eorge couldn’t get to 
sleep. He heard Nina 
sighing, and knew she couldn’t 
either. At last she said, 
“George, I’m scared.” 

“Don’t be, honey. There 
isn’t anything more to worry 
about. The worst has already 
happened. And Herbert says 
he’s all right.” 

“Yes, but — there was that 
first paper, the Notice of At- 
tachment of Domicile.” 
“Well?” 

“We didn’t do it. You re- 
member, it said if the vextix 
wasn’t wrytled by Jumel 40th, 
they’d attach the house. And 
we didn’t wrytle it because we 
didn’t know what it was. So 
they could still attach the 
house!” 

“Go to sleep, honey. Her- 
bert said he was explaining 
things. He’ll get it fixed up.” 
“But— all right.” 

Her breathing quieted. The 

47 



PARALLEL BEANS 




sound was soothing, and 
George drifted off to sleep 
himself. He wakened some 
hours later, feeling very cold. 

He pulled the blanket up, 
but the room was still too 
chilly. He’d have to shut the 
window. 

He looked around to orient 
himself before getting out of 
bed. What he saw startled him 
into full wakefulness. There 
were stars overhead. Stars! 
Then the roof — 

He put his hand on Nina’s 
shoulder and shook her gent- 
ly. “Honey . they’ve at- 
tached the house.” 

For a moment Nina was si- 
lent. He thought she must still 
be asleep. Then she answered, 
“It’s because we didn’t wrytle 
the vextix, I suppose. Did they 
take everything?” 

“It’s too dark to be sure. 
But I think so. Except the 
bed.” 

“It’s probably illegal to at- 
tach the bed.” 

For a moment George 
thought she was going to be- 
gin whu-whu-ing again, but 
she didn’t. She pulled a quilt 
around her shoulders and put 
her feet on the floor. “Let’s go 
see just what they did at- 
tach,” she said. 

Their cautious inspection 
did not take long. Except for 
the concrete slab that formed 
the foundation of the house, 
and the bed in which they had 
been sleeping, everything was 
gone. Their domicile had been 
thoroughly attached. 

48 



Nina said, “I never realized 
before how limited the floor 
space in the house was. We 
can’t take three steps without 
being at the edge of the foun- 
dation. Well. Do you suppose 
we’ll have to keep up the pay- 
ments even though the house 
is gone?” 

“I imagine so. And it’s go- 
ing to be difficult, explaining 
to the bank what happened to 
their security.” 

Nina sniffled. “ — No, I’m 
not going to cry. But I’m dis- 
appointed in Herbert. I 
thought he’d be able to clear 
things up with the parallel 
time-stream people better than 
this.” 

“Um. You’d better get back 
in bed, honey. You’ll freeze, 
going around like this.” 

Nina obeyed. George sat 
down beside her dejectedly. 
“It’ll be light soon,” she said. 
“Maybe we can think of some- 
thing to do when it’s light. I 
wish we could make some 
coffee. Coffee would help a lot. 
—Oh! What was that?” 

T HERE had been a soft yet 
profound vibration in the 
air, like a deep harp string 
being plucked. The vibration 
was repeated. Abruptly the 
gray pre-dawn light around 
them was blotted out. 

George swallowed. He said, 
“Honey, I think they’ve un- 
attached the house.” 

It was true. Their dazed 
tour found everything back in 
place. Even the books Herbert 

MARGARET ST. CLAIR 




had given them for a wedding 
present— a two-volume set of 
log tables — were back in the 
bookcase. 

They looked at each other. 
At last Nina drew a quaver- 
ing sigh. “Let’s go outside,” 
she said. “I don’t know what 
— but I’m afraid. Let’s go out- 
side.” 

“All right,” said George. 

In the chill gray light the 
exterior of the house was ir- 
reproachably normal. The 
lawn, the pelargoniums, the 
mail box, the sidewalk, were 
all in place. But on the vacant 
lot adjoining, the vacant lot 
Herbert had run across yes- 
terday afternoon, there was a 
house whose exterior was also 
irreproachably normal. Its 
lawn, its pelargoniums, its 
mail box, its sidewalk, were 
also all in place. 

Nina clutched at George’s 
shoulder. In a high voice she 
said, “They’ve sent another 
our house. They’ve sent back 
two of our house.” 

“Maybe there’s some mis- 
take. Do you want to go over 
and look at the other one?” 

“I don’t need to go look. 
I know without looking. It’s 
exactly like our house. It is 
our house. Everything’s the 
same. There is even half a 
caramel cake on the cake dish 
put in the kitchen.” 

She began to cry gently. 
George stood embracing her 
helplessly while the sky grew 
light. At last he drew her back 
within their own house that 



wasn’t on the formerly vacant 
lot. 

They sat down in the living 
room. George’s mind was busy 
with financial considerations. 
If he could contact the owner 
of the vacant lot — Beckstein, 
his name was — before he 
heard about the house on his 
lot — and if there wasn’t trou- 
ble with the zoning laws — but 
of course George didn’t have a 
building permit. Did you need 
a building permit for a house 
that was already built? Prob- 
ably. And was the second their 
house too near the first one? 
Would Beckstein sue if he 
found out about the house be- 
fore George could buy the lot? 
And what about the zoning 
laws? 

He kept on petting Nina. At 
last he said, “I’m going to turn 
on the TV set.” 

“Just more trouble,” she 
answered in a muffled voice. 

“Um. Maybe we’ll get some 
explanation of all this.” He 
clicked the switch. 

T HERE was a soft whuffle 
from the zulceet slot. A 
document— the most official- 
looking, the most formidable 
to date — dropped out. There 
was scarcely an inch on its 
exterior that wasn’t covered 
with blue wax seals. 

George opened it. The head- 
ing was in very large Gothic 
lettering. “Notice of Restora- 
tion and Recompensation,” it 
read. 

“Whenas it has come to the 

49 



PARALLEL BEANS 




attention of the Videal Inter- 
city Authority that the domi- 
cile of the owners of videal set 
no. 37765" (still blurred) 
“was wrongfully attached, 
and, whenas it has come to the 
attention of the Videal Inter- 
city Authority that the spouse, 
female sex, of the owners of 
videal set No. 37765" (just as 
blurred as ever) “was wrong- 
fully attached also, be it en- 
acted by the puissance of the 
Videal Intercity Authority in 
council assembled that said 
domicile and said spouse, 
female sex, be immediately re- 
stored. And be it further en- 
acted by the said puissance of 
said Videal Intercity Author- 
ity that Recompensation for 
said wrongful attachment be 
made synchronously, via the 
Imperial Duplisissix. Signed, 
Videal Intercity Authority in 
full council assembled.” Un- 
derneath the signature there 
was a truly enormous blue wax 
seal. 

George closed his eyes and 
then opened them. There was 
really nothing to be said. 

The doorbell rang. 

They both jumped. George 
went to answer it. Herbert 
was standing with a pleased 
grin on the porch. 

“Hi, George,” he said. “Hi, 
sis. Miss me a lot, hunh? I 
was gone a long time, but I 
finally got it fixed, didn’t I? 
Do I ever know my stuff !” 



He sounded jubilant, but 
George was struck by a curi- 
ous echoing quality in his 
brother-in-law’s words. He 
opened the door wide and 
looked out at the their house 
that stood on the erstwhile 
vacant lot. 

A Herbert was standing on 
the porch of the other their 
house too. For a wild moment 
George wondered if there was 
a George and a Nina inside 
that house also. But there was 
a slightly puzzled look on the 
second Herbert’s face. 

“Whyn’t you answer?” The 
Herberts went on. It was light 
enough so George could see 
that their lips were moving in 
perfect unison. They weren’t 
twins, any more than the 
houses were ; the Herberts 
were the same Herbert, in the 
sense that the houses were the 
same house. Recompensation 
had been made via the Imper- 
ial Duplisissix ; presumably 
the Videal Intercity Authority 
had thought that George 
would enjoy having two 
spouses, female sex ; and 
George now had two brothers- 
in-law. 

“Sis made any cakes late- 
ly?” the pair asked brightly. 
“She makes good cakes, if they 
had better icing. D’ju learn 
how to make better icing while 
I was gone, sis? How’s for a 
nice piece cake?”

MARGARET ST. ClAIR 




W HEN the concealed gong 
sounded, the man sitting 
on the floor sighed. He con- 
tinued, however, to slump 
loosely against the curving, 
pearly plastic of the wall, and 
took care not to glance to- 
ward the translucent ovals he 
knew to be observation 
panels. 

He was a large man, but 
thin and bony-faced. His 
dirty gray coverall bore the 
name “Barnsley” upon grimy 
white tape over the heart. Ex- 
cept at the shoulders, it looked 
too big for him. His hair was 
dark brown, but the sandy 
ginger of his two-week beard 
seemed a better match for his 
blue eyes. 

The 

Finally, he satisfied the 
softly insistent gong by stand- 
ing up and gazing in turn at 
each of the three doors spaced 
around the cylindrical cham- 
ber. He deliberately adopted 
an expression of simple-mind- 
ed anticipation as he ambled 
over to the nearest one. 

The door was round, about 
four feet in diameter, and set 
in a flattened part of the wall 
with its lower edge tangent 
with the floor. Rods about two 
inches thick projected a 
hand’s breadth at four, eight, 
and twelve o’clock. The mark- 
ings around them suggested 
that each could be rotated 




Finding his way out of this 



maze was only half the fob. 

Wedge 

to three different positions. 
Barnsley squatted on his heels 
to study these. 

Noting that all the rods 
were set at the position he 
had learned to think of as 
“one,” he reached out to 
touch the door. It felt slightly 
warm, so he allowed his fin- 
gertips to slide over the upper 
handle. A tentative tug pro- 
duced no movement of the 
door. 

“That’s it, though,” he 
mumbled quietly. “Well, now 
to do our little act with the 
others !” 

He moved to the second 
door, where all the rods were 



51 




set at “two.” Here he fell to 
manipulating the rod handles, 
pausing now and then to 
shove hopefully against the 
door. Some twenty minutes 
later, he tried the same rou- 
tine at the third door. 

Eventually, he returned to 
his starting point and rotated 
the rods there at random for 
a few minutes. Having, ap- 
parently by accident, arrang- 
ed them in a sequence of 
one-two-three, he contrived to 
lean against the door at the 
crucial instant. As it gave be- 
neath his weight, he grabbed 
the two lower handles and 
pushed until the door rose to 
a horizontal position level 
with its hinged top. It settled 
there with a loud click. 

B arnsley stooped to 
crawl through into an 
arched passage of the same 
pearly plastic. He straight- 
ened up and walked along for 
about twenty feet, flashing a 
white-toothed grin through 
his beard while muttering 
curses behind it. Presently, he 
arrived at a small round bay, 
to be confronted by three 
more doors. 

“Bet there’s a dozen of you 
three-eyed clods peeping at 
me,” he growled. “How’d you 
like me to poke a boot 
through the panel in front of 
you and kick you blubber- 
balls in all directions? Do you 
have a page in your data 
books for that?” 

He forced himself to feel 



sufficiently dull-witted to 
waste ten minutes opening 
one of the doors. The walls of 
the succeeding passage were 
greenish, and the tunnel 
curved gently downward to 
the left. Besides being some- 
what warmer, the air exuded 
a faint blend of heated ma- 
chine oil and something like 
ripe fish. The next time 
Barnsley came to a set of 
doors, he found also a black 
plastic cube about two feet 
high. He squatted on his heels 
to examine it. 

I’d better look inside or 
they’ll be disappointed, he 
told himself. 

From the corner of his eye, 
he watched the movement of 
shadows behind the translu- 
cent panels in the walls. He 
could picture the observers 
there: blubbery bipeds with 
three- jointed arms and legs 
ending in clusters of stubby 
but flexible tentacles. Their 
broad, spine-crested heads 
would be thrust forward and 
each would have two of his 
three protruding eyes direct- 
ed at Barnsley’s slightest 
move. They had probably been 
staring at him in relays every 
second since picking up his 
scout ship in the neighboring 
star system. 

That is, Barnsley thought, 
it must have been the next, 
system whose fourth planet 
he had been photo-mapping 
for the Terran Colonial Ser- 
vice. He hoped he had not 
been wrong about that. 



52 



H. B. FYFE 




Doesn’t matter, he consoled 
himself, as long as the Ser- 
vice can trace me. These slobs 
certainly aren’t friendly. 

He reconsidered the scanty 
evidence of previous contact 
in this volume of space, light- 
years from Terra’s nearest 
colony. Two exploratory ships 
had disappeared. There had 
been a garbled, fragmentary 
message picked up by the re- 
corders of the colony’s satel- 
lite beacon, which some 
experts interpreted as a hasty 
warning. As far as he knew, 
Barnsley was the only Ter- 
ran to reach this planet alive. 

To judge from his peculiar 
imprisonment, his captors had 
recovered from their initial 
dismay at encountering an- 
other intelligent race — at 
least to the extent of desiring 
a specimen for study. In 
Barnsley’s opinion, that put 
him more or less ahead of the 
game. 

“They’re gonna learn a 
lot!” he muttered, grinning 
vindictively. 

He finished worrying the 
cover off the black box. Inside 
was a plastic sphere of water 
and several varieties of food 
his captors probably consid- 
ered edible. The latter ranged 
from a leafy stalk bearing a 
number of small pods to a 
crumbling mass resembling 
moldy cheese. Barnsley hesi- 
tated. 

“I haven’t had the guts to 
try this one yet,” he reminded 
himself, picking out what 



looked like a cluster of long, 
white roots. 

The roots squirmed feebly 
in his grasp. Barnsley return- 
ed them to the box instantly. 

Having selected, instead, a 
fruit that could have been a 
purple cucumber, he put it 
with the water container into 
a pocket of his coverall and 
closed the box. 

Maybe they won’t remem- 
ber that I took the same thing 
once before, he thought. Oh, 
hell, of course they will! But 
why be too consistent? 

He opened one of the doors 
and walked along a bluish 
passage that twisted to the 
left, chewing on the purple 
fruit as he went. It was 
tougher than it looked and 
nearly tasteless. At the next 
junction, he unscrewed the 
cap of the water sphere, 
drained it slowly, and flipped 
the empty container at one of 
the oval panels. A dim shad- 
ow blurred out of sight, as if 
someone had stepped hastily 
backward. 

“Why not?” growled Barns- 
ley. “It’s time they were 
shaken up a little!” 

P RETENDING to have seen 
something where the con- 
tainer had struck the wall, he 
ran over and began to feel 
along the edge of the panel. 
When his fingertips encoun- 
tered only the slightest of 
seams, he doubled his fists 
and pounded. He thought he 
could detect a faint scurrying 



THE WEDGE 



53 




on the other side of the wall. 

Barnsley laughed aloud. He 
raised one foot almost waist- 
high and drove the heel of his 
boot through the translucent 
observation panel. Seizing the 
splintered edges of the hole, 
he tugged and heaved until 
he had torn out enough of the 
thin wall to step through to 
the other side. He found him- 
self entering a room not much 
larger than the passage be- 
hind him. 

To his left, there was a 
flicker of blue from a crack 
in the wall. The crack wid- 
ened momentarily, emitting a 
gabble of mushy voices. The 
blue cloth was twitched away 
by a cluster of stubby ten- 
tacles, whereupon the crack 
closed to an almost impercept- 
ible line. Barnsley fingered 
his beard to hide a grin and 
turned the other way. 

He stumbled into a number 
of low stools surmounted by 
spongy, spherical cushions. 
One of these he tore off for a 
pillow before going on. At the 
end of the little room, he 
sought for another crack, 
kicked the panel a bit to loos- 
en it, and succeeded in sliding 
back a section of wall. The 
passage revealed was about 
the size of those he had been 
forced to explore during the 
past two weeks, but it had an 
unfinished, benind-the-scenes 
crudeness in appearance. 
Barnsley pottered along for 
about fifteen minutes, during 
which time the walls resound- 



ed with distant running and 
he encountered several ob- 
viously improvised barriers. 

He kicked his way through 
one, squeezed through an 
opening that had not been 
closed quite in time, restrain- 
ed a wicked impulse to cross 
some wiring that must have 
been electrical, and at last al- 
lowed himself to be diverted 
into a passage leading back 
to his original cell. He amused 
himself by trying to picture 
the disruption he had caused 
to the honeycomb of passage- 
ways. 

“There !” he grinned to him- 
self. “That should keep them 
from bothering me for a few 
hours. Maybe one or two of 
them will get in trouble over 
it — I hope!” 

He arranged his stolen 
cushion where the wall met 
the floor and lay down. 

A thought struck him. He 
sat up to examine the cushion 
suspiciously. It appeared to be 
an equivalent to foam rubber. 
He prodded and twisted until 
convinced that no wires or 
other unexpected objects were 
concealed inside. Not till then 
did he resume his relaxed po- 
sition. 

Presently one of his hands 
located and pinched a tiny 
switch buried in the lobe of 
his left ear. Barnsley concen- 
trated upon keeping his fea- 
tures blank as a rushing 
sound seemed to grow in his 
ear. He yawned casually, mov- 
ing one hand from behind 



54 



H. B. FYFE 




his head to cover his mouth. 

Having practiced many 
times before a mirror, he did 
not think that any possible 
watcher would have noticed 
how his thumb slipped briefly 
inside his mouth to give one 
eyetooth a slight twist. 

A strong humming inun- 
dated his hearing. It contin- 
ued for perhaps two minutes, 
paused, and began again. 
Barnsley waited through two 
repetitions before he “yawn- 
ed” again and sleepily rolled 
over to hide his face in his 
folded arms. 

“Did you get it all?” he 
murmured. 

“Clear as a bell,” replied a 
tiny voice in his left ear. 
“Was that your whole day’s 
recording?” 

“I guess so,” said Barnsley. 
“To tell the truth, I lose track 
a bit after two weeks without 
a watch. Who’s this? San- 
chez ?” 

“That’s right. You seem to 
come in on my watch pretty 
nearly every twenty-four 
hours. Okay, I’ll tape a slow- 
ed-down version of your blast 
for the boys in the back room. 
You’re doing fine.” 

“TVTOT for much longer,” 
Barnsley told him. 
“When do I get out of here?” 

“Any day,” Sanchez reas- 
sured him. “It was some job 
to learn an alien language 
with just your recordings and 
some of your educated guesses 
to gu on. We’ve had a regular 

THE WEDGE 



mob sweating on it night and 
day.” 

“How is it coming?” 

“It turns out they’re noth- 
ing to worry about. The fleet 
is close enough now to pick 
up their surface broadcasting. 
Believe me, your stupid act 
has them thoroughly confus- 
ed. They hold debates over 
whether you could possibly be 
intelligent enough to belong 
in a spaceship.” 

“Meanwhile, I’m slowly 
starving,” said Barnsley. 

“Just hang on for a couple 
of days. Now that we know 
where they are, they’re in for 
a shock. One of these morn- 
ings, they’re going to hear 
voices from all over their 
skies, demanding to know 
what kind of savages they are 
to have kidnapped you — and 
in their own language!” 
Barnsley grinned into his 
improvised pillow as Sanchez 
signed off. Things would real- 
ly work out after all. He was 
set for an immensely lucra- 
tive position ; whether as 
ambassador, trade consultant, 
or colonial governor depended 
upon how well the experts 
bluffed the blubber-heads. 
Well, it seemed only his due 
for the risks he had taken. 

“Omigosh !” he grunted, sit- 
ting up as he pictured the 
horde of Terran Colonial ex- 
perts descending upon the 
planet. “I’ll be the only one 
here that hasn’t learned to 
speak the language!”

“Not too bad. They treat me 
all right. But these natives 
sure are tough on visitors. I’ve 
never been checked so thor- 
oughly in all my life — and now 
this thirty day quarantine ! 
Why, you’d think I was carry- 
ing the plague instead of a 
sample case !” 

The chubby little commer- 
cial traveller probably had a 
right to complain, Lanceford 
thought. After all, a Niobian 
quarantine station isn’t the 
pleasantest sort of environ- 
ment. It’s not meant to be 
comfortable, physical discom- 
fort being as good a way as 
any to discourage casual visi- 
tors. The ones who have forti- 
tude enough to stand the entry 
regulations can get in, but 
tourists seldom visit Niobe. 
However, the planet’s expand- 
ing economy offered a fertile 
field for salesmen, and men of 
that stripe would endure far 
worse hardships than a port of 
entry in pursuit of the Al- 
mighty Credit. 

Now this fellow, George 
Perkins, was a typical sales- 
man. And despite his soft ex- 
terior there was a good hard 
core inside. 

Lanceford looked him over 
and decided that he would last. 
“You came here of your own 
free will, didn’t you?” he 
asked. 

“If you call a company direc- 
tive free will,” Perkins an- 
swered. “I wouldn’t come here 
for a vacation, if that’s what 
you mean. But the commercial 



opportunities can’t be ig- 
nored.” 

“I suppose not, but you can 
hardly blame the Niobians 
for being suspicious of stran- 
gers. Perhaps there’s no harm 
in you. But they have a right 
to be sure ; they’ve been burn- 
ed before.” Lanceford uncoil- 
ed his lean gray length from 
the chair and walked over to 
the broad armorglas window. 
He stared out at the gloomy 
view of Niobe’s rainswept 
polar landscape. “You know,” 
he continued, “you might call 
this Customs Service a natural 
consequence of uninvestigated 
visitors.” He brooded over the 
grayness outside. A polar view 
was depressing — scrubby veg- 
etation, dank grassland, the 
eternal Niobian rain. He felt 
sorry for Perkins. Thirty days 
in this place would be sheer 
torture. 

“It must have been quite 
some disturbance to result in 
this.” Perkins waved his hand 
at the barren room. “Sounds 
like you know something about 
it.” 

“I do. In a way you might 
say that I was responsible for 
it.” 

“Would you mind telling 
me?” 

“T WOULDN’T mind at all.” 
Lanceford looked at his 
watch. “If I have the time, 
that is. I’m due to be picked 
up in an hour, but Niobians 
have some quaint conceptions 
of time. So if you want to take 



58 



J. F. BONE 




a chance that I won’t finish — ” 

“Go ahead.” 

“To start with, take a look 
at that insigne over the door. 
The whole story’s right there.” 

Perkins eyed the emblem of 
the Niobian Customs Service. 
It was a five-pointed star sur- 
rounding a circle, superimpos- 
ed over the typically Terran 
motto: “Eternal Vigilance is 
the Price of Safety.” He nod- 
ded. 

“How come the Terran 
style ?” he asked. 

“That’s part of the story. 
Actually that insigne’s a whole 
chapter of Niobe’s history. But 
you have to know what it 
stands for.” Lanceford sighed 
reminiscently. “It began dur- 
ing the banquet that celebrat- 
ed the signing of the Agree- 
ment which made Nlobe a 
member of the Confederation. 
I was the Director of the 
BEE’s Niobe Division at that 
time. As a matter of fact, I’d 
just taken the job over from 
Alvord Sims. The Old Man had 
been ordered back to Terra, to 
take over a job in the Admin- 
istration, and I was the next 
man in line. 

“The banquet was a flop, of 
course. Like most mixed gath- 
erings involving different 
races, it was a compromise af- 
fair. Nobody was satisfied. It 
dragged along in a spirit of 
suffering resignation — the 
Niobians quietly enduring the 
tasteless quality of the food, 
while the Confederation repre- 
sentatives, wearing unobtru- 



sive nose plugs, suffered po- 
litely through the watered- 
down aroma and taste of the 
Niobian delicacies. All things 
being considered, it was mov- 
ing along more smoothly than 
it had any right to, and if 
some moron on the kitchen 
staff hadn’t used tobasco sauce 
instead of catsup, we’d prob- 
ably have signed the Agree- 
ment and gone on happily ever 
after. 

“But it didn’t work out that 
way. 

“Of course it wasn’t entire- 
ly the kitchen’s fault. There 
had to be some damn fool at 
the banquet who’d place the 
bomb where it would do some 
good. And of course I had to 
be it.” Lanceford grinned. 
“About the only thing I have 
to say in my defense is that I 
didn’t know it was loaded !” 

Perkins looked at him ex- 
pectantly as Lanceford paus- 
ed. “Well, don’t stop there,” 
he said. “You’ve got me inter- 
ested.” 

Lanceford smiled good- 
naturedly and went on. 

W E HELD the banquet in 
the central plaza of Base 
Alpha. It was the only roofed 
area on the planet large 
enough to hold the crowd of 
high brass that had assembled 
for the occasion. We don’t do 
things that way now, but fifty 
years ago we had a lot to learn. 
In those days, the admission 
of a humanoid planet into the 
Confederation was quite an 



TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 



59 




event. The VIP’s thought that 
the native population should 
be aware of it. 

I was sitting between Kron 
Avar and one of the high brass 
from the Bureau of Interstel- 
lar Trade, a fellow named 
Hartmann. I had no business 
being in that rarefied air, since 
Kron was one of the two First 
Councilors and Hartmann 
ranked me by a couple of thou- 
sand files on the promotion 
list. But I happened to be a 
friend of Kron’s, so protocol 
got stretched a bit in the name 
of friendship. He and I had 
been through a lot together 
when I was a junior explorer 
with the BEE some ten years 
before. We’d kept contact with 
each other ever since. We had 
both come up the ladder quite 
a ways, but a Planetary Direc- 
tor, by rights, belonged far- 
ther down the table. So there I 
was, the recipient of one of the 
places of honor and a lot of 
dirty looks. 

Hartmann didn’t think 
much of being bumped one 
seat away from the top. He 
wasn’t used to associating 
with mere directors, and be- 
sides, I kept him from talking 
with Kron about trade rela- 
tions. Kron was busy rehash- 
ing the old days when we were 
opening Niobe to viscayacul- 
ture. Trade didn’t interest him 
very much, and Hartmann in- 
terested him less. Niobians are 
never too cordial to strangers, 
and he had never seen the BIT 
man before this meeting. 

60 



Anyway, the talk got around 
to the time he introduced me 
to vorkum, a native dish that 
acts as a systemic insect repel- 
lant— and tastes like one ! And 
right then I got the bright idea 
that nearly wrecked Niobe. 

As I said, there was both 
Niobian and Confederation 
food at the banquet, so I fig- 
ured that it was a good time as 
any to get revenge for what 
my dog-headed friend did to 
my stomach a good decade be- 
fore. 

So I introduced him to Ter- 
ran cooking. 

Niobians assimilate it all 
right, but their sense of taste 
isn’t the same as ours. Our 
best dishes are just mush to 
their palates, which are con- 
ditioned to sauces that would 
make the most confirmed spice 
lover on Earth run screaming 
for the water tap. They have a 
sense of the delicate, too, but 
it needs to be stimulated with 
something like liquid fire be- 
fore they can appreciate it. 
For instance, Kron liked Earth 
peaches, but he spiced them 
with horseradish and red pep- 
per. 

I must admit that he was a 
good sport. He took the hors 
d’oeuvres in stride, swallowing 
such tasteless things as caviar, 
Roquefort and anchovy paste 
without so much as a grimace. 
Of course, I was taking an un- 
fair advantage of Kron’s nat- 
ural courtesy, but it didn’t 
bother me too much. He had 
rubbed that vorkum episode in 

J. F. BONE 




for years. It was nice to watch 
him squirm. 

W HEN I pressed him to try 
an oyster cocktail, I fig- 
ured things had gone far 
enough. 

He took it, of course, even 
though anyone who knew Ni- 
obians could see that he didn’t 
want any part of it. There was 
a pleading look in his eye that 
I couldn’t ignore. After all, 
Kron was a friend. I was actu- 
ally about to stop him when he 
pulled an oyster from its red 
bath and popped it into his 
mouth. There was a ‘you’ll be 
sorry’ look on his face. I ges- 
tured to a waiter to remove the 
cocktail as he bit into the oys- 
ter, figuring, somewhat belat- 
edly, that I had gone too far. 

The' grateful look I got from 
him was sufficient reward. But 
then it happened. Kron stop- 
ped looking grateful and liter- 
ally snatched the cocktail back 
from the startled waiter ! 

He looked at me with an ex- 
pression of disgust. “The first 
decent food thus far,” he said, 
“and you attempt to send it 
away!” 

“Huh?” I exclaimed stupid- 
ly. “I didn’t want to make you 
miserable.” 

“Miserable ! Hah ! This dish 
is wonderful! What in the 
name of my First Ancestor is 
it?” His pleased grin was 
enough like a snarl to make 
Hartmann cringe in his chair. 
Since Kron and I were both 
speaking Niobian rather than 

TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 



Confed, he didn’t understand 
what was happening. I sup- 
pose he thought that Kron was 
about to rip my throat out. It 
was a natural error, of course. 
You’ve seen a dog smile, and 
wondered what was going on 
behind the teeth? Well, Kron 
looked something like that. A 
Niobian with his dog-headed 
humanoid body is impressive 
under any conditions. When he 
smiles he can be downright 
frightening. 

I winked at Hartmann. 
“Don’t worry, sir,” I said. 
“Everything’s all right.” 

“It certainly is,” Kron said 
in Confed. “This dish is deli- 
cious. Incidentally, friend 
Lanceford, what is it? It tastes 
something like our Komal, but 
with a subtle difference of 
flavor that is indescribable!” 

“It’s called an oyster cock- 
tail, Kron,” I said. 

“This is a product of your 
world we would enjoy!” Kron 
said. “Although the sauce is 
somewhat mild, the flavor of 
the meat is exquisite!” He 
closed his eyes, savoring the 
taste. “It would be somewhat 
better with vanka,” he said 
musingly. “Or perhaps with 
Kala berries.” 

I shuddered. I had tried 
those sauces once. Once was 
enough! I could still feel the 
fire. 

“I wonder if you could ship 
them to us,” Kron continued. 

Hartmann’s ears pricked up 
at the word “ship.” It looked 
like an opening gambit for a 

61 




fast sales talk on behalf of in- 
terstellar trade, a subject dear 
to his heart. 

But I was puzzled. I couldn’t 
figure it out until I tried one of 
the oysters — after which I 
knew! Some fool had dished 
them up in straight tobasco 
sauce! It took some time be- 
fore I could talk, what with 
trying to wash the fire out of 
my mouth, and during the con- 
versational hiatus Hartmann 
picked up the ball where I 
dropped it. So I sat by and 
listened, my burned mouth be- 
ing in no condition for use. 

“T’M AFRAID that we could- 
n’t ship them,” Hartmann 
said. “At least not on a com- 
mercial basis. Interstellar 
freight costs are prohibitive 
where food is concerned.” 
Kron nodded sadly. He pass- 
ed the oysters to Tovan Harl, 
his fellow First Councilor. 
Harl went through the same 
reaction pattern Kron had 
shown. 

“However,” Hartmann con- 
tinued, “we could send you a 
few dozen. Perhaps you could 
start a small oyster farm.” 

“Is this a plant?” Kron ask- 
ed curiously. 

“No, it’s a marine animal 
with a hard outer shell.” 

“Just like our Komal. We 
could try planting some of 
them in our oceans. If they 
grow, we will be very obliged 
to you Terrans for giving us a 
new taste sensation.” 

“Since my tribe is a seafar- 

62 



ing one,” Harl interjected, 
“they can be raised under my 
supervision until we find the 
exact methods to propagate 
them in our seas.” 

Hartmann must have been 
happy to get off the hook. It 
was a small request, one that 
was easy to fulfill. It was a 
good thing that the Niobians 
didn’t realize what concessions 
they could wring from the 
BIT. The Confederation had 
sunk billions into Niobe and 
was prepared to sink many 
more if necessary. They would 
go to almost any lengths to 
keep the natives happy. If that 
meant star-freighter loads of 
oysters, then it would be star- 
freighter loads of oysters. The 
Confederation needed the ger- 
ontin that grew on Niobe. 

The commercial worlds 
needed the anti-aging drug 
more and more as the explora- 
tion of space continued — not to 
mention the popular demand. 
Niobe was an ideal herbarium 
for growing the swampland 
plant from which the complex 
of alkaloids was extracted. 

So Hartmann made a note 
of it, and the subject was drop- 
ped. 

I didn’t think anything more 
about it. Kron was happy, 
Harl was happy, and Hart- 
mann was feeling pleased with 
himself. There was no reason 
to keep the oyster question 
alive. 

But it didn’t die there. By 
some sort of telepathy the Ni- 
obians scattered along the long 

J. F. BONE 




tables found out what had been 
getting talked about at the 
upper end. 

By this time I was on the 
ball again. When the orders 
went in I slipped a note to the 
cooks to use tabasco or vanaka 
on the Niobian orders. It was 
fortunate that there was an 
ample supply of oysters avail- 
able, because the banquet dis- 
solved shortly thereafter into 
an outright oyster feed. The 
Niobians dropped all pretense. 
They wanted oysters — with 
vanaka, with tabasco or with 
Kala berries. The more effete 
Earth preparations didn’t 
rouse the slightest enthusiasm, 
but the bivalve found its place 
in the hearts and stomachs of 
the natives. The oysters ulti- 
mately ran out, but one thing 
was certain. There was a defi- 
nite bond of affection between 
our two utterly dissimilar spe- 
cies. 

The era of good feeling per- 
sisted for several hours. There 
was no more quiet undertone 
of polite suffering among our 
guests. They were enjoying 
themselves. The Agreement 
was signed with hardly an ex- 
ception being taken to its 
clauses and wording. 

Niobe became a full member 
of the Confederation, with 
sovereign planetary rights, 
and the viscaya concentrate 
began flowing aboard the ships 
waiting at the polar bases. 

A day later I got orders to 
start winding up the BEE’s in- 
stallations on Niobe. The con- 



sular service would take over 
after I had finished . 

LANCEFORD looked at his 
watch. “Well, we’re going to 
have time. It looks like they’ll 
be late. Want to hear the rest 
of it?” 

“Naturally,” Perkins said. 
“I certainly wouldn’t want you 
to stop here.” 

“Well,” Lanceford contin- 
ued, “the next four years 
weren’t much.” 

W E SPENT most of the 
time closing down the 
outpost and regional installa- 
tions, but it took longer than I 
expected what with the diffi- 
culty in getting shipping space 
to move anything but viscaya 
concentrate off the planet. Of 
course, like any of the Confed- 
eration bureaus, the BEE died 
hard. With one thing and an- 
other, there were still a lot of 
our old people left. We still had 
the three main bases on the 
continental land masses in op- 
erating condition, plus a few 
regional experiment stations 
on Alpha Continent and the 
Marine Biology Labs on Var- 
nel Island. I’d just closed the 
last regional stations on Beta 
and Gamma when Heinz Berg- 
dorf paid me an official call. 

Heinz was the senior biolo- 
gist on Varnel. He was a good 
looking lad of Teutonic ances- 
try, one of those big blond kids 
who fool you. He didn’t look 
like a scientist, but his skull 
held more knowledge of Ni- 

63 



TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 




obe’s oceans than was good for 
a man. He would have to un- 
learn a lot of it before he took 
his next job, or so I thought at 
the time. 

Anyway, Heinz came into 
my office looking like someone 
had stolen his favorite fishnet. 
The expression of Olympian 
gloom on his beak-nosed face 
would have done credit to 
Zeus. It didn’t take any great 
amount of brains to see that 
Heinz was worried. It stuck 
out all over him. He draped 
himself limply in the chair be- 
side my desk. 

“We’ve got troubles, Chief,” 
he announced. 

I grinned at him. I knew 
perfectly well why he was 
here. Something had come up 
that was too big for him to 
handle. That was Heinz’s only 
fault, a belief in the omnipo- 
tence of higher authority. If 
he couldn’t handle it, it was a 
certainty that I could — even 
though I knew nothing of 
either his specialty or his 
problems. However, I liked the 
man. I did my best to give him 
the fatherly advice he occa- 
sionally needed, although he 
would have been better off half 
the time if he hadn’t taken it. 

“Well, what’s the trouble 
now?” I asked. “From the look 
on your face it must be un- 
pleasant. Or maybe you’re just 
suffering from indigestion.” 

“It’s not indigestion, Chief.” 

“Well, don’t keep me in sus- 
pense. Tell me so I can worry 
too.” 

64 



I didn’t like the way he 
looked. Of course, I’d been ex- 
pecting trouble for the past 
year. Things had been going 
far too smoothly. 

“Oysters!” Bergdorf said 
laconically. 

“Oysters ?” 

I looked at him incredulous- 
ly. Bergdorf sat straight up in 
his chair and faced me. There 
was no humor in his eyes. 
“For God’s sake! You fright- 
ened me for a moment. You’re 
joking, I hope.” 

“Far from it,” Bergdorf re- 
plied. “I said oysters and I 
mean oysters. It’s no joke! 
Just who was the unutterable 
idiot who planted them here?” 

I T TOOK a minute before I 
remembered. “Hartmann,” 
I said. “Of the BIT. He order- 
ed them delivered at the re- 
quest of Kron Avar and Tovan 
Harl. I suppose Harl planted 
them. I never paid very much 
attention to it.” 

“You should have. It would 
have been better if they had 
imported Bengal tigers! How 
long ago did this infernal in- 
sanity happen?” 

“Right after the Agreement 
was signed, I guess. I’m sure 
it was no earlier than that, 
because Niobians met up with 
oysters for the first time at 
that affair.” I still didn’t get 
it, but there was no doubt that 
Heinz was serious. I tried to 
remember something about 
oysters, but other than the 
fact that they were good to eat 

J. F. BONE 




and produced pearls I could 
think of nothing. Yet Berg- 
dorf looked like the end of the 
world was at hand. There was 
something here that didn’t add 
up. “Well, get on with it,” I 
said. “As far as marine biol- 
ogy is concerned I’m as inno- 
cent as a Lyranian vix-gin. Tell 
me — what’s wrong with the 
oysters?” 

“Nothing! That’s the trou- 
ble. They’re nice healthy speci- 
mens of terrestrial Ostrea lu- 
rida. We found a floating limb 
with about a dozen spat cling- 
ing to it.” 

“Spat?” 

“Immature oysters.” 

“Oh. Is that bad?” 

“Sure it’s bad. I suppose I’d 
better explain,” Bergdorf said. 
“On Earth an oyster wouldn’t 
be anything to worry about, 
even though it produces some- 
where between sixteen and 
sixty million fertile eggs every 
year. On Earth this tremen- 
dous fertility is necessary for 
survival, but here on Niobe 
where there are no natural en- 
emies to speak of, it’s abso- 
lutely deadly ! 

“Just take these dozen spat 
we found. Year after next, 
they’d be breeding size, and 
would produce about three 
hundred million larvae. If 
everything went right, some 
three years later those three 
hundred million would produce 
nine thousand trillion baby 
oysters ! Can you image how 
much territory nine thousand 
trillion oysters would cover?” 



1 STOPPED listening right 
then, and started looking at 
the map of Niobe pinned on 
the wall. “Good Lord! They’d 
cover the whole eastern sea- 
board of Alpha from pole to 
pole.” 

Bergdorf said smugly, “Ac- 
tually, you’re a bit over on 
your guess. Considering the 
short free swimming stage of 
the larvae, the slow eastern 
seaboard currents, poor bot- 
tom conditions and overcrowd- 
ing, I doubt if they would 
cover more than a thousand 
miles of coastline by the fourth 
year. Most of them would die 
from environmental pressures. 

“But that isn’t the real trou- 
ble. Niobe’s oceans aren’t like 
Earth’s. They’re shallow. It’s 
a rare spot that’s over forty 
fathoms deep. As a result, oys- 
ters can grow almost any- 
where. And that’s what’ll 
happen if they aren’t stopped. 
Inside of two decades they’ll 
destroy this world !” 

“You’re being an alarmist,” 
I said. 

“Not so much as you might 
think. I don’t suppose that the 
oysters will invade dry land 
and chase the natives from 
one rain puddle to another, but 
they’ll grow without check, 
build oyster reefs that’ll men- 
ace navigation, change the 
chemical composition of Ni- 
obe’s oceans, pollute the water 
with organic debris of their 
rotting bodies, and so change 
the ecological environment of 
this world that only the hardi- 

65 



TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 




est and most adaptable life 
forms will be able to survive 
this!” 

“But they’ll be self-limit- 
ing,” I protested. 

“Sure. But by the time they 
limit themselves, they will 
eliminate about everything 
else.” 

“If you’re right, then, 
there’s only one thing to do. 
We’ll have to let the natives 
know what the score is and 
start taking steps to get rid of 
them.” 

“Oh, I’m right. I don’t think 
you’ll find anyone who’ll dis- 
agree with me. We kicked this 
around at the Lab for quite a 
spell before I came up here 
with it.” 

“Then you’ve undoubtedly 
thought of some way to get rid 
of them.” 

“Of course. That was one of 
the first things we did. The 
answer’s obvious.” 

“Not to me.” 

“Sure. Starfish. They’ll 
swamp up the extra oysters in 
jig time.” 

“But won’t the starfish get 
too numerous?” 

“No. They die off pretty fast 
without a source of food sup- 
ply. From what we can find 
out about Niobe’s oceans, there 
is virtually no acceptable food 
for starfish other than oysters 
a,nd some microscopic animal 
life that wouldn’t sustain an 
adult.” 

“Okay, I believe you. But 
you still leave me cold. I can’t 
remember anything about a 

66 



starfish that would help him 
break an oyster shell." 

B ERGDORF grinned. “I see 
you need a course in ma- 
rine biology. Here’s a thumb- 
nail sketch. First, let’s take 
the oyster. He has a big mus- 
cle called an adductor that 
closes his shell. For a while 
he can exert a terrific pull, but 
a steady tension of about nine 
hundred grams tires him out 
after an hour or so. Then the 
muscle relaxes and the shell 
gapes open. Now the starfish 
can exert about thirteen hun- 
dred grams of tension with his 
sucker-like tube feet, and since 
he has so many of them he 
doesn’t have to use them all at 
one time. So, by shifting feet 
as they get tired, he can exert 
this pull indefinitely. 

“The starfish climbs up on 
the oyster shell, attaches a few 
dozen tube feet to the outside 
of each valve and starts to pull. 
After a while the oyster gets 
tired, the shell opens up, and 
the starfish pushes its stomach 
out through its mouth opening, 
wraps the stomach around the 
soft parts of the oyster and di- 
gests it right in the shell !” 

I shuddered. 

“Gruesome, isn’t it?” Berg- 
dorf asked happily. “But it’s 
nothing to worry about. Star- 
fish have been eating oysters 
on the half shell for millions 
of years. In fact I’ll bet that a 
starfish eats more oysters in 
its lifetime than does the most 
confirmed oyster-addict.” 



J. F. BONE 




“It’s not the fact that they 
eat them,” I said feebly. “It's 
the way they do it. It makes 
me ill!” 

“Why should it? After all a 
starfish and a human being 
have a lot in common. Like 
them, you have eaten oysters 
on the half shell, and they’re 
usually alive when you gulp 
them down. I can’t see where 
our digestive juices are any 
easier on the oyster than those 
of a starfish.” 

“Remind me never to eat 
another raw oyster,” I said. 
“On second thought you won’t 
have to. You’ve ruined my ap- 
petite for them forever.” 
Bergdorf chuckled. 

“Well, now that you’ve dis- 
posed of one of my eating hab- 
its,” I said bitterly, “let’s get 
back to the problem. I presume 
that you’ll have to find where 
the oysters are before you 
start in working them over 
with starfish.” 

“You’ve hit the reason why 
I’m here. That’s the big prob- 
lem. I want to find their 
source.” 

“rkON’T you know?” 

U “I can make a pretty 
good guess. You see, we picked 
this limb out of the Equatorial 
current. As you know, Varnel 
Island is situated right at the 
western termination of the 
current. We don’t get much 
littoral stuff unless it comes 
from the Islands or West Beta. 
And as far as I can figure the 
islands are the best bet. These 



spat probably came from the 
Piralones, that island group in 
the middle of the current 
about halfway across.” 

I nodded. “It would be a 
good bet. They’re uninhabited. 
If Harl wanted an isolated 
spot to conduct oyster plant- 
ing experiments, I couldn’t 
think of a better location. No- 
body in his right mind would 
visit that place willingly. The 
islands support the damnedest 
assortment of siths you ever 
saw.” 

“If that’s where it is,” Berg- 
dorf said, “we can thank 
heaven for the natives’ sus- 
picious nature. That location 
may help us save this world !” 
I laughed at him. “Don’t be 
so grim, Heinz — or so godlike. 
We’re not going to save any 
worlds.” 

“Someone has to save them.” 
“We don’t qualify. What 
we’ll do is chase this business 
down. We’ll find out where the 
oysters come from, get an idea 
of how bad things are and then 
let the Niobians know about it. 
If anyone is going to save this 
planet it won’t be a bunch of 
Confederation exploration spe- 
cialists.” 

Bergdorf sighed. “You’re 
right, of course.” 

I slapped him on the shoul- 
der. “Cheer up, Heinz.” I turn- 
ed to my appointment calendar 
and checked it over. There was 
nothing on it that couldn’t 
wait a few days. “Tell you 
what,” I continued. “I need a 
vacation from this place. We’ll 



TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 



67 




take my atomic job and go oys- 
ter hunting. It ought to be 
fun.” 

Bergdorf’s grin was like a 
sunrise on Kardon. 

I BROUGHT the ’copter 
down slowly through the 
overcast, feeling my way cau- 
tiously down to the ground 
that radar told me was some- 
where below. We were hardly 
a hundred and fifty meters up 
before it became visible 
through the drenching tropic 
rain. Unless you’ve seen it 
you can’t imagine what rain 
is really like until you’ve been 
in the Niobian tropics. It liter- 
ally swamps everything, in- 
cluding visibility. 

It was the Piralones all 
right. 

The last time I’d seen them 
was when I led the rescue 
party that pulled Wilson 
Chung and his passengers out 
of the Baril Ocean, but they 
were still the same, tiny de- 
serted spots of land surround- 
ed by coral reefs. We were 
over the biggest one of the 
group, a rounded hummock 
barely a kilometer in diameter, 
surrounded by a barrier reef 
of coral. Between the reef and 
the island a shallow lagoon lay 
in sullen grayness, its surface 
broken into innumerable tiny 
wavelets by the continual 
splash of rain. The land itself 
was a solid mass of olive- 
green vegetation that ended 
abruptly at a narrow beach. 
“Well, we’re here,” I said. 



“Grim looking place, isn’t it?” 

“Whoever spoke of the beau- 
ties of tropical islands didn’t 
have Niobe in mind,” Bergdorf 
agreed. “This place looks like 
something left behind by a 
cow.” 

I couldn’t help the chuckle. 
The simile was too close for 
comfort. I tilted the rotors 
and we went down to hover 
about ten meters off the beach. 
Bergdorf pointed down the 
beach. I headed the 'copter in 
that direction as Bergdorf 
looked out of the bubble, in- 
tently scanning the waters of 
the lagoon. Finally he looked 
up with an expression of un- 
derstanding on his lean face. 

“No wonder I missed 
them!” he murmured with 
awe. “There are so many that 
there’s no floor of the lagoon 
to spot them against. They 
cover the entire bottom! You 
might as well set her down 
here; it’s as good a place as 
any.” 

I throttled back and landed 
the whirlybird on the beach. 
“You had your quota of vor- 
kum?” I asked as Bergdorf 
reached for the door handle. 

The biologist made a wry 
face. “Naturally. You think I’d 
be fool enough to go outside 
without it?” 

“I wouldn’t know. All I’m 
sure of is that if you’re going 
to get out here, you’d better 
be loaded.” I followed after 
him as he opened the door and 
jumped down to the ground. 

A small horde of siths in-

stantly left the cover of the 
jungle and buzzed out to in- 
vestigate. A few years ago, 
that would have been the sig- 
nal for ray beams at fan aper- 
ture, but both Bergdorf and I 
ignored them, trusting in the 
protection of the vorkum. The 
beasties made a tactical pass 
at Heinz, thought the better of 
it and came wheeling over in 
my direction. I could almost 
see the disappointed look in 
their eyes as they caught my 
aura, put on the brakes and 
returned disappointed to their 
shelter under the broadleaves. 
Whatever vorkum did, it cer- 
tainly convinced insects that 
we were inedible and antiso- 
cial. 

One or two ventured back 
and buzzed hopefully around 
our heads before giving up in 
disgust. 

“It beats me what they live 
on,” Bergdorf said, gesturing 
at the iridescent flash of the 
last bloodsucker as it disap- 
peared beneath the broad- 
leaves. 

“As long as it isn’t us, I 
don’t give a damn,” I said. 
“Maybe they live on decaying 
vegetable matter until some- 
thing live and bloody comes 
along. Anyway, they seem to 
get along.” 

Bergdorf walked the few 
steps to the water’s edge. “I 
won’t even have to go swim- 
ming,” he said as he walked 
into the water a few steps, 
bent and came up with what 
looked like a handful of rocks. 

TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 



“/"YYSTERS?” I asked, turn- 
v/ ing one over in my hand. 
“Yep. Nice little 0. lurida. 
About three years old, I’d 
guess, and just ripe for breed- 
ing. You know, I’ve never seen 
them growing so close to the 
shore. They must be stacked 
on top of each other out there 
a ways. There’s probably mil- 
lions of them in this lagoon 
alone!” 

“Well, we’ve found where 
they’re coming from. Now all 
that’s left is to figure out what 
to do about it.” 

“We’d still better check 
Beta. They might possibly 
have reached there.” 

“Not unless someone’s 
planted them,” I said. “You’re 
forgetting the ocean cur- 
rents.” 

“No. I was thinking of 
planted areas.” 

“Well, think again. You may 
know your biology, but I know 
Niobians. They’re too suspi- 
cious to bring untried things 
too close to where they live. 
They’ve been that way as long 
as I can remember them, and I 
don’t think that anything — 
even something as delightful 
as an oyster — would make 
them change overnight.” 

“I hope you’re right.” 

“Oh, we’ll check Beta, all 
right,” I said. “But you can 
send a couple of your boys to 
do it. There’s no sense in our 
wasting time with it.” 

I heard the noise behind us 
before Bergdorf did. We turn- 
ed in time to see four Niobians 

69 




emerge from the jungle and 
glide purposefully toward us. 
The tribal tattoos on their 
chests identified them as mem- 
bers of Tovan Harl’s com- 
mune. I nudged Heinz and 
murmured, “We’ve got com- 
pany.” 

The natives approached to 
within a few paces. They stood 
politely to leeward while one 
of their number approached. 
“I’m sorry,” he said without 
the normal introduction, “but 
this is leased land. You will 
have to leave at once. And you 
will please return the oysters 
to the lagoon. It is not permit- 
ted to remove them.” 

“Oh, all right,” I said. 
“We’re through here anyway. 
We’ll visit the other islands 
and then be off.” 

“The other islands are also 
leased property. When you 
leave I will radio the other 
guards, and you will not be 
permitted to land.” 

“This is not according to 
your customs,” I protested. 

“I realize that, Mr. Lance- 
ford,” the native said. “But I 
have given oath to keep all 
trespassers out.” 

I nodded. It wasn’t usual. I 
wondered what Harl had in 
mind — possibly a planetary 
monopoly. If that was his plan, 
he was due for a surprise. 

“That’s very commendable,” 
Bergdorf said, “but these oys- 
ters are going with me. They 
are needed as evidence.” 

“I’m sorry, sir,” the native 
said. “The oysters stay here.” 

70 



“Don’t be a fool, Heinz,” I 
interjected. “They’re in the 
right. The oysters are their 
property. If you try to take 
them you’ll be in trouble up to 
your ears.” 

“But I need those oysters, 
Arthur! Probably the only 
adult oyster tissue on Niobe is 
on these islands. I need a sam- 
ple of it.” 

“Well, it’s your neck.” I 
turned to the native. “Don’t be 
too hard on him,” I said. “He’s 
quite an important man.” 

The Niobian nodded and 
grinned. “Don’t worry, sir. He 
won’t feel a thing. But I really 
wish to apologize for our rude- 
ness. If conditions were differ- 
ent — ” 

He paused and turned to- 
ward Bergdorf who was climb- 
ing into the ’copter with the 
oysters still in his hand. 

I WASN’T surprised that he 
didn’t make it. In fact, I’d 
have been more surprised if he 
had. Heinz crumpled to the 
ground beside the ship. One of 
the natives came forward, took 
the oysters from his limp hand 
and threw them back into the 
lagoon. 

“All right,” I said to the 
spokesman. “You fellows clob- 
bered him, so now you can get 
him into the ship.” 

“That is only fair,” the na- 
tive said. “We do not want to 
cause you any extra inconven- 
ience.” He gestured to his com- 
panions. Between them they 
got Bergdorf’s limp body into 

J. F. BONE 




the ship and strapped into one 
of the seats. They got out, I 
got in, and in a minute the two 
of us got out of there, going 
straight up through to over- 
cast to get a celestial bearing 
for home. 

I kept looking at Bergdorf’s 
limp body and grinning. 

It was nearly an hour later 
before Bergdorf woke up. 
“What hit me?” he asked fuz- 
zily. 

“Subsonics,” I said. “They 
should have scared you to 
death.” 

“I fainted?” 

“Sure you did. You couldn’t 
help it. They hit like a ton of 
brick.” 

“They certainly do,” he said 
ruefully. 

“They can kill,” I said. “I’ve 
seen them do it. The Niobians 
generate them naturally, and 
they can focus them fairly 
well. Probably this quality was 
one of their forms of defense 
against predators in their 
early days. It’s a survival 
trait ; and when there are 
enough natives present to aug- 
ment the impulses they can be 
downright nasty.” 

Bergdorf nodded. “I know,” 
he said. He stopped talking 
and looked out over the sun- 
drenched top of the overcast. 
“It looks like Tovan Harl 
wants to keep this oyster farm 
a private matter. In a way he’s 
doing us a favor, but I’d still 
feel happier if I had one or 
two of those oysters.” 

“Why do you need them?” 

TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 



“Well, I figured on getting a 
couple of the Navy's organic 
detectors and setting them for 
oyster protoplasm. You know 
how sensitive those gadgets 
are. There might be a small 
but significant change in oys- 
ter protoplasm since it has ar- 
rived here.” 

“Well, you don’t need to 
worry,” I said. “I put one of 
your pets in my pocket before 
the natives showed up, so 
you’ve got what you need.” I 
pulled the oyster out and hand- 
ed it to him. It didn’t look any 
the worse for its recent rough 
treatment. 

Bergdorf grinned. “I knew I 
could trust you, Chief. You’re 
sneaky!” 

I laughed at him. 

W E ARRIVED back at Al- 
pha without trouble. I 
shooed Bergdorf back to Var- 
nel with the one oyster and a 
promise that I’d back him up 
in any requisitions he cared to 
make. After that I checked up 
on the BEE business I had 
neglected for the past couple 
of days and, finally, late that 
night took one of the Base’s 
floaters and drove slowly down 
the trail to Kron’s village. 

While Earth-style civiliza- 
tion had done much to improve 
transport and communication 
on Niobe, it hadn’t — and still 
hasn’t for that matter — pro- 
duced a highway that can 
stand up to the climate. Roads 
simply disappear in the bot- 
tomless mud. So whatever 



71 




vehicular transport exists 
on Niobe is in the form of 
floaters, whose big sausage- 
shaped tires give enough flota- 
tion to stay on top of the ooze, 
and sufficient traction to move 
through the morass that is Ni- 
obe’s surface. They’re clumsy, 
slow and hard to steer. But 
they get you there — which is 
something you can’t say about 
other vehicles. 

Kron’s village had changed 
somewhat since I first visited 
it. The industrial section was 
new. The serried ranks of low 
dural buildings gleamed metal- 
lically in the glare of the float- 
er’s lights, glistening with the 
sheets of water that ran from 
their roofs and sides. The 
power-broadcast station that 
stood in the center of the vil- 
lage hadn’t been there either. 
But other than that everything 
was pretty much the same as 
it always had been, an open 
space in the jungle filled with 
stone - walled, thatch - roofed 
houses squatting gloomily in 
the endless rain. 

The industry, such as it was, 
was concentrated solely upon 
the production of viscaya con- 
centrate. It had made little dif- 
ference in the Niobian way of 
life, which was exactly as the 
natives wanted it. 

It was odd, I reflected, how 
little change had taken place 
.in Niobian society despite 
better than two decades of 
exposure to Confederation 
technology. Actually, the Con- 
federation could leave tomor- 

72 



row, and would hardly be 
missed. There would be no cul- 
tural vacuum. The strangers 
would simply be gone. Possibly 
some of our artifacts would be 
used. The atomic power-broad- 
cast station would possibly 
stay, and so would the high- 
powered radio. Perhaps some 
of the gadgetry the natives had 
acquired from us would be 
used until it was worn out, but 
the pattern of the old ways 
would stay pretty much as it 
had always been. For Niobian 
culture was primarily philo- 
sophical rather than techno- 
logical and it preferred to re- 
main that way. 

I parked my floater beside 
the house that had sheltered 
Kron as long as I had known 
him. I entered without an- 
nouncing myself. 

As an old friend I had this 
privilege, although I seldom 
used it. But if I had come for- 
mally there would have been 
an endless rigmarole of social 
convention that would have 
had to be satisfied before we 
could get down to business. I 
didn’t want to waste the time. 

K RON was seated behind a 
surprisingly modem desk, 
reading a book by the light of 
a Confederation glowtube. I 
looked at its title — The Ana- 
lects of Confucius — and blink- 
ed. I’d heard of it. It and 
Machiavelli’s Prince are clas- 
sics on governmental person- 
ality and philosophy, but I had 
never read it. Yet here, hun- 

J. F. BONE 




dreds of light years from the 
home world, this naked alien 
was reading and obviously en- 
joying that ancient work. It 
made me feel oddly ashamed of 
myself. 

He looked up at me, nodded 
a greeting and laid the book 
down with a faint expression 
of regret on his doglike face. I 
found a chair and sat down si- 
lently. I wondered how he 
found time to read. My job 
with the BEE kept me busy 
every day of the 279-day year. 
And his, which was more im- 
portant and exacting than 
mine, gave him time to read 
philosophy! I sighed. It was 
something I could never un- 
derstand. 

I waited for him to speak. 
As host, it was his duty to 
open the wall of silence which 
separated us. 

“Greetings, friend Lance- 
ford,” Kron said. “My eyes are 
happy with the pleasure of be- 
holding you.” He spoke in the 
ancient Niobian formula of 
hospitality. But he made it 
sound as though he really 
meant it. 

“It’s a double joy to behold 
the face of my friend and to 
hear his voice,” I replied in the 
same language. Then I switch- 
ed to Confed for the business 
I had in mind. Their polite 
forms are far too clumsy and 
uncomfortable for business 
use ; it takes half a day to get 
an idea across. “It seems as 
though I’m always coming to 
you with trouble,” I began. 

TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 



“What now?” Kron asked. 
“Every time I see you, I hope 
that we can relax and enjoy 
our friendship, but every time 
you are burdened. Are you 
Earthmen forever filled with 
troubles or does my world pro- 
voke them?” He smiled at me. 

“A little of both, I suppose,” 
I said. 

Kron hummed — the Niobian 
equivalent of laughter. “I’ve 
been observing you Earthmen 
for the past twenty years, and 
I have yet to see one of you 
completely relaxed. You take 
yourselves much too seriously. 
After all, my friend, life is 
short at best. We should enjoy 
some of it. Now tell me your 
troubles, and perhaps there is 
no cause to worry.” 

“You’re wrong, Kron. There 
is plenty of cause to worry. 
This can affect the well-being 
of everything on this world.” 
Kron’s face sharpened into 
lines of interest. “Continue, 
friend Lanceford.” 

“It’s those oysters the BIT 
sent you a few years ago. 
They’re getting out of hand.” 
Kron hummed. “I was afraid 
that it—” 

“ — was something serious !” 
I finished. “That’s what I told 
Heinz Bergdorf when he came 
to me with this story. Now 
sober down and listen ! This is 
serious !” 

«TT SOUNDS pretty grim,” 
■i- Kron said after I had fin- 
ished. “But how is it that your 
people didn’t foresee the dan- 

73 




ger? Something as viciously 
reproductive as the oyster 
should be common knowledge.” 
“Not on our world. You see, 
the study of sea life is a spe- 
cialized science on Earth. It is 
one of the faults of our techno- 
logical civilization that almost 
everyone must specialize from 
the time he enters secondary 
school. Unless one specializes 
in marine biology, one gener- 
ally knows little or nothing 
about it.” 

“Odd. Very odd. But then, 
you Earthmen always were a 
peculiar race. Now, if I heard 
you right, I believe that you 
said there is an animal on your 
world which preys upon these 
oysters. A starfish?” 

“Yes.” 

“Won’t this animal be as 
destructive as the oyster?” 
“Bergdorf doesn’t think so, 
and I trust his judgment.” 
“Won’t this animal also kill 
our Komal ? They are like these 
oysters of yours in a way.” 
“But they burrow, and the 
starfish doesn’t. They’ll be safe 
enough.” 

Kron sighed. “I knew that 
association with you people 
would prove to be a mixed 
blessing.” He shrugged his 
shoulders and turned his chair 
to his desk. A Niobian face ap- 
peared on the screen. “Call a 
Council meeting and let me 
know when it is ready,” Kron 
ordered. 

“Yes, Councilor,” the face 
replied. 

“Well, that’s that. Now we 



can relax until the Council 
manages to get together.” 
“How long will that take?” 
“I haven’t the least idea,” 
Kron said. “Several days — 
several weeks. It all depends 
upon how soon we can get 
enough Council members to- 
gether to conduct business.” 

I said unhappily, “I’d like to 
have your outlook but we’re 
fighting against time !” 

“You Earthmen pick the 
most impossible opponents. 
You should learn to work with 
time rather than against it.” 
He pulled at one ear reflective- 
ly. “You know, it is strange 
that your race could produce 
ethical philosophers like this 
one.” He tapped the Analects 
with a webbed forefinger. 
“Such contrast of thought on 
a single world is almost in- 
credible!” 

“You haven’t seen the half 
of it!” I chuckled. “But I'm 
inclined to agree with you. 
Earth is an incredible world.” 

F ortunately there was 

a battle cruiser in the 
Polar spaceport on a goodwill 
mission. We had no trouble 
about getting the detectors 
Bergdorf needed, plus a crew 
to run them. The Navy is co- 
operative about such things, 
and every officer knows the im- 
portance of the BEE on a 
planetary operation. We could 
have had the entire cruiser if 
we had wanted it. 

A week later the four Ma- 
rine Lab ships, each equipped 



74 



J. F. BONE 




with a detector, started a 
search of Niobe’s oceans. 
Their atomic powerplants 
could drive them along at a 
respectable speed. Bergdorf 
and I expected a preliminary 
report within a month. 

We weren’t disappointed. 

The results were shocking, 
but not unexpected. Prelimi- 
nary search revealed no oys- 
ters in the other two major 
oceans, but the Baril Ocean 
was badly infested. There were 
groups and islands of imma- 
ture oysters along the entire 
course of the Equatorial cur- 
rent and the tropical coast of 
Alpha. Practically every island 
group in the central part of 
the ocean showed traces of the 
bivalves. It was amazing how 
far they had spread. Even the 
northern shallows had a num- 
ber of thriving young colonies. 

Bergdorf was right. An- 
other year and we’d have been 
swamped. As it was it was 
nothing to laugh about. 

The news reached Kron just 
before the Council meeting, 
which, like most of Niobe’s off- 
season politics, had been de- 
layed time after time. Since a 
Council meeting requires an 
attendance of ninety per cent 
of the Council, it had been 
nearly impossible to schedule 
an assembly where a quorum 
could be present. But our news 
broadcasts over the BEE radio 
reached every comer of the 
planet, and the note of urgen- 
cy in them finally produced 
results. 



The Niobians held the emer- 
gency session at Base Alpha, 
where our radio could carry 
the proceedings to the entire 
planet. Whatever else they 
may be, Niobian government 
sessions are open to the public. 
Since the advent of radio, 
practically the entire public 
listens in. 

Like the natives, I listened 
too. I wasn’t surprised when 
Kron appeared in my office, his 
eyes red and swollen from lack 
of sleep, but with a big grin 
on his face that exposed his 
sharp sectorial teeth. “Well, 
that’s over, friend Lanceford. 
Now send us your starfish.” 
“That’s easier said than 
done,” I replied gloomily. “I’ve 
contacted the Confederation. 
They won’t ship twenty 
pounds of starfish — let alone 
the twenty thousand tons 
Bergdorf says we’ll need !” 
“Why not? Are they crazy? 
Or do they want to destroy 
us?” 

“Neither. This is just a sam- 
ple of bureaucracy at work. 
You see, the starfish is classed 
as a pest on Earth. Confedera- 
tion regulations forbid the ex- 
portation of pests to member 
planets.” 

“But we need them!” 

«T REALIZE that, but the 
JL fact hasn’t penetrated to 
the highest brass.” I laughed 
humorlessly. “The big boys 
simply can’t see it. By the time 
we marshal enough evidence 
to convince them, it will be too 

75 



TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 




late. Knowing how Adminis- 
tration operates, I’d say that 
it’d take at least a year for 
them to become convinced. 
And another two months for 
them to act.” 

“But we simply can’t wait 
that long ! Your man Bergdorf 
has convinced me. We’re in 
deadly danger!” 

“You're going to have to 
wait,” I said grimly. “Unless 
you can find some way to jar 
them out of their rut.” 

Kron looked thoughtful. “I 
think that can be done, friend 
Lanceford. As I recall, your 
bureaus are timid things. Fur- 
thermore, we have something 
they want pretty bad. I think 
we can apply pressure.” 

“But won’t your people ob- 
ject? Doesn’t that deny your 
basic philosophy of non-inter- 
ference with others?” 

Kron grinned ferociously. 
“Not at all. Like others of 
your race, you have never un- 
derstood the real significance 
of our social philosophy. What 
it actually boils down to is sim- 
ply this — we respect the cus- 
toms and desires of others but 
require in turn that they re- 
spect ours.” 

“You mean that you will 
use force against the rest of 
the Confederation? But you 
can’t do that! You wouldn’t 
stand a chance against the 
Navy.” 

“We will first try a method 
we have used with our own 
tribes who get out of line. I 
don’t think anything more will 

76 



be necessary.” Kron’s voice 
was flat. “It goes against the 
grain to do this, but we are 
left no choice.” He turned and 
left the room without a fare- 
well, which was a measure of 
his agitation. 

I sat there behind my desk 
wondering what the Niobians 
could do. Like my ex-boss Al- 
vord Sims, I had a healthy re- 
spect for them. It just could 
be that they could do plenty. 

They could. 

O RGANIZATION! Man, 
you’ve never seen any- 
thing like what the Niobians 
tossed at our startled heads! 
We always thought the Plan- 
etary Council was a loose and 
ineffective sort of thing, but 
what happened within the next 
twenty hours had to be seen to 
be believed. I saw it. But it 
was days before I believed it. 

Within a day the natives 
had whipped up an organiza- 
tion, agreed on a plan of ac- 
tion and put it into effect. By 
noon of the next day Niobe 
was a closed planet. A message 
was sent to the Confederation 
informing them that Niobe 
was withdrawing until the 
emergency was over. An em- 
bargo was placed on all move- 
ment of shipping. 

And everything stopped. 

No factories operated. The 
big starfreighters stood idle 
and empty at the polar bases. 
Not one ounce of gerontin or 
its concentrate precursor left 
Niobe. Smiling groups of Ni- 

J. F. BONE 




obians using subsonics to en- 
force their demands, paralyzed 
everything the Confederation 
had operated on the planet. No 
one was hurt. The natives 
were still polite and friendly. 
But Confederation business 
came to an abrupt halt, and 
stayed halted. 

It was utterly amazing! I 
had never heard of a planet- 
wide boycott before. But Niobe 
was entirely within her rights. 
The Confederation had to ac- 
cept it. 

And, of course, the Confed- 
eration capitulated. If the Ni- 
obians were fools enough to 
want pests as a condition of 
resuming viscaya shipments — 
well, it was their affair. The 
Confederation needed viscaya. 
It was willing to do almost 
anything to assure its contin- 
ued supply. 

With the full power of the 
Confederation turned to giv- 
ing Niobe what she wanted, it 
wasn’t long before the oysters 
were under control. We estab- 
lished a systematic seeding 
procedure for the starfish that 
kept arriving by the freighter 
load. In a few months Berg- 
dorf reported that an ecologi- 
cal balance had been achieved. 

“DUT didn’t the starfish cre- 

D ate another pest prob- 
lem?” Perkins asked. 

“Not at all,” Lanceford said. 
“I told you that the Niobians 
had an odd sense of taste. 
Starfish proved to be quite ac- 
ceptable to the Niobian palate. 

TO CHOKE AN OCEAN 



They merely added another 
item to Niobe’s food supply.” 
Perkins shuddered delicate- 
ly. “I wouldn’t eat one of those 
things in a million years.” 
“You’re going to have to eat 
vorkum if you expect to sur- 
vive on this world. Compared 
to vorkum, a starfish is sheer 
pleasure ! But that wasn’t the 
end of it,” Lanceford added 
with a smile. “You see, shortly 
after things had simmered 
down to normal Kron dropped 
into my office. 

“ ‘I think, friend Lanceford,’ 
he said, ‘that we are going to 
have to create a permanent or- 
ganization to keep unwanted 
visitors out. This little affair 
has been a needed lesson. I 
have been reading about your 
planetary organization, and I 
think a thing like your Cus- 
toms Service is vitally needed 
on our world to prevent future 
undesirable biological impor- 
tations.’ 

“ ‘I agree,’ I replied. ‘Any- 
thing that would prevent a 
repetition of this business 
would be advisable.’ 

“So that was how the Cus- 
toms Service started. The in- 
signe you will recognize as a 
starfish opening an oyster. Un- 
fortunately the Niobians are 
quite literal minded. When 
they say any biological impor- 
tation will be quarantined and 
examined, they mean Confed- 
eration citizens too ! 

“And that, of course, was 
the entering wedge. You’ll find 
things quite homelike once you

get out of here. The natives 
have developed an organiza- 
tion that’s a virtual copy of 
our Administrative Branch. 
Customs, as you know, is a tri- 
umph of the bureaucratic sys- 
tem, and naturally the idea 
spread. Once the natives got 
used to a permanent govern- 
ment organization that was 
available at all times, it was 
only a question of time before 



the haphazard tribal organiza- 
tion became replaced by a 
planetary union. You could al- 
most say that it was an in- 
evitable consequence.” 
Lanceford grinned. “The 
Niobians didn’t realize that 
the importation of foreign 
Customs was almost as bad as 
the importation of foreign ani- 
mals !” He chuckled at the un- 
conscious pun. END

Words

Music 



By ARTHUR PORGES 



«Y eah > it>s a talent, all 
J- right,” Lane said gloom- 
: fly. He emptied his fourth 
drink, and looked about in 
envious fascination. “But it’s 
not like fortune-telling. I can’t 
make a living out of it. I’ve 
never even been inside a plush 
joint like this one before. No 



money in music nowadays; 
people don’t learn instruments 
— they just listen to hi-fi from 
the can.” 

“You couldn’t get in here 
with a million.” Carson was 
complacent. “This room’s 
strictly for celebrities. Money 
or not, you gotta be known. 



No one else heard the music, hut it was a lovely overture. 



The only trouble was — the curtain was about to go up! 



79 




Congressmen fly down from 
Washington; movie and TV 
stars drop by for drinks, and 
to be seen. The place is always 
crawling with VJ.P.’s” 

The little man was wistful. 
“Yeah, the classiest crowd I’ve 
ever seen. Even the music’s 
special: ‘Pomp and Circum- 
stance’ from every other 
table.” 

“Fine, I see you’re getting 
tuned up. Let’s have that dem- 
onstration now, okay? I can’t 
promise a thing, but I got 
friends here in New York. We 
might get you a good spot on 
TV. Eight, ten weeks on a 
high-priced quiz show could 
do a lot for your bank ac- 
count.” 

“It’s all right with me,” 
Lane said, brightening a little. 
“Where should I start?” 

“Try that gal over there, 
huh?” 

“You gotta remember,” 
Lane reminded him, “it’s not 
definite like words. Just at- 
mosphere, mostly. The per- 
son’s character and general 
background. An idea what’s 
on their mind — even a peek 
into the future now and then.” 

“That so?” Carson was im- 
pressed. “Sounds like quite a 
deal to me.” 

“Lemme explain first what 
it’s like, so there won’t be any 
misunderstandings. For in- 
stance, there was a guy I went 
to school with. His folks were 
set on making him a doctor. 
He was agreeable, but I didn’t 
hear any medical music from 

80 



him — nothing like it. Used to 
hear other kinds, especially 
one set of themes. I didn’t 
know my stuff then, so it took 
me quite a while to identify 
the music. Know what? it was 
that suite, ‘The Planets,’ by 
Holst.” 

Carson leaned forward, eye- 
brows raised. “ ‘The Planets’ ? 
Greek to me; I’m a Welk fan 
myself. What’s the point?” 

L ANE raised an admonitory 
finger and laid it along 
his big nose. “That kid wound 
up at Mt. Wilson, a first class 
astronomer. He found out 
something new about the 
planet Mercury. Forget what 
it was. If I’d known then what 
a talent I had, I could’ve pre- 
dicted the whole thing.” 

“Say,” Carson exclaimed 
in admiration, “that’s pretty 
neat! You hear a piece about 
planets — hear it inside your 
head, right? — and the guy 
turns out to be an astrono- 
mer.” 

“Yeah, but I can’t make a 
dime. All these years a music 
teacher, starving in three-four 
time,” he added sourly. 

“We’ll change that pretty 
damn quick. You got a talent 
there. Go ahead, see what you 
can do with the woman. But 
I give you fair warning — I 
know her.” 

“This is on the level,” Lane 
said, blearily resentful. 

“I’m only kidding.” 

“Okay, then. Here goes.” 
He stared at the woman. 



ARTHUR PORGES 




She twisted her creamy bare 
shoulders uneasily, and stop- 
ped smiling at her sleek com- 
panion. 

“Well, what do you hear?” 
Carson demanded impatient- 
ly. 

“Mendelssohn. Easy one : 
‘Wedding March.’ Kinda jazz- 
ed up, though.” 

“Ha! Anything else?” 
“Clicking sounds, and a 
whir.” 

“That’s not music.” There 
was naked suspicion in Car- 
son’s voice. 

“It’s never all music. Plain 
sounds, too. Remember, noise 
and melody are just vibra- 
tions. It’s just a matter of 
how they’re organized.” 
Carson reflected. “Clicking 
and whirring. What the devil 
— say-y-y!” 

“Right, ain’t I?” Lane 
demanded, morosely trium- 
phant. “It always makes sense 
if you think it through.” 

“It does at that. Damn good 
sense ! If I didn’t know for a 
fact that she just hit New 
York — you sure you haven’t 
met her before?” 

“I told you this was 
straight! I don’t know the 
dame from your grandmother. 
It’s a talent, that’s all.” 
“Don’t get mad. It hasn’t 
sunk in yet. See, that’s Rita 
Howard, the movie star. Mar- 
ried seven times, some legal.” 
“Mendelssohn,” Lane said 
with satisfaction. “What 
about the whirr, clackety- 
clack?” 



"Simple, if you know Rita. 
She’s nuts about roulette. 
Practically haunts Vegas. 
Never has a dime. Say, try 
her some more ; she oughta be 
good for a whole concert.” 
With a shrug, the little man 
fixed his gaze again. He be- 
gan to hum a scrap of melo- 
dy. His voice was harsh but 
deadly accurate. “Tough one,” 
he muttered. “Not a war-horse 
like Mendelssohn. But it'll 
come. Dum de dum dah. Aha ! 
Tricky. Roussel : ‘The Spider’s 
Banquet.’ ” 

“That’s a song? Helluva 
title, if you ask me.” 

“Orchestral piece. Fits, 
doesn’t it? Seven husbands, 
you said.” 

“I get it — she’s like a spi- 
der! Rita’s sucked plenty of 
men dry, all right. And the 
latest victim’s pouring drinks 
into her right now. Well, at 
least no spider has her curves ! 
You’re all right, Lane — a 
genius!” 

“I got a talent. But it don’t 
buy any groceries.” 

“It will. That’s a promise, 
Boy ! This could be a big thing. 
Let’s give it another whirl. 
Take that big, red-faced bird 
over there. What do you get 
from him?” 

«T EMME listen . Sounds 
like a dog growling, that 
possible? Must be; it’s coming 
through plain. A big dog. A 
mean one. Music, too. Another 
toughie. You sure pick ’em. 
Liszt? No, Berlioz. Not a

WORDS AND MUSIC 




major work. Overture, I 
think. Wait, it’s coming. Dum 
dah dee-dah. Know it well. Got 
it! ‘Judges of the Secret 
Court.’ Sure, that’s a composi- 
tion; don’t look so surprised. 
Welk don’t play this one.” 
Carson studied him in awe. 
“Well, I’m damned. A bull’s 
eye. That guy’s Senator Craw- 
ford, a big shot on the Judici- 
ary Committee. They call him 
a watch dog; some say more 
of a mad dog. You’re batting 
a thousand.” 

“He was easy,” Lane said, 
without conceit. He picked up 
the empty glass and set it 
down again. His host took the 
hint, beckoning to a waiter. 

«rriWO more Martinis, very 
dry.” 

Lane was peering after the 
waiter. “He’s mad at us and 
the world,” the little man mut- 
tered. “Hate music blasting 
out of him like a ninety-piece 
orchestra. ‘Vile Race of Cour- 
tiers’ from ‘Rigoletto.’ ” 

“Hell with him,” Carson 
grunted. “See that fellow over 
there, the little plump one 
with buck teeth, grinning like 
a happy shark?” 

“Yeah. I’ll work him for 
you.” He gazed steadily at the 
man, who looked back at Lane, 
grinned wider and nodded. 

“Doesn’t know you,” Car- 
son sneered, “but that S.O.B. 
would shine up to Judas if he 
thought it might pay off some 
time! Since you’re here, he 
assumes you’re somebody im- 

82 



portant. What’re you get- 
ting?” 

“A cinch, this one. It’s 
played to death. ‘La Gazza 
Ladra.’ ” 

“What in hell’s that? Why 
can’t they have the English 
names?” 

“ ‘Gazza Ladra.’ Thieving 
magpie. Overture by Rossini.” 

“Thieving mag — good boy !” 
Carson chuckled delightedly. 
“Talk about a crook! Pearson 
had the Honorable J. Calvert 
Bangs tagged months ago. Oh, 
brother — and him howling 
smear and libel all over Wash- 
ington!” 

The little man sucked at his 
drink. He hiccoughed. “Told 
you it works.” 

“One more, huh?” Carson 
said. “This is fun. Wednesday 
I’ll get Jim Stein to meet us 
here. You got a great gim- 
mick, man, and Stein’s the 
one to do things with it.” 

“The TV producer?” 

“That’s him. Movies, too. 
Look, get the guy leaving ! The 
chunky character in the dark 
suit. There, he’s stopped by 
the door.” 

“Okay.” Lane peered va- 
cantly at the tense, stony- 
faced man. “Ha. Should know 
this one. I’m a little tight, and 
that slows me up. Rimsky- 
Korsakov ... or Rachmaninov ? 
Some Russian, that’s for sure. 
Romantic School. Classical 
theme, too, weaving in and 
out. Whaddya know about 
that? Queer combination: 
classical and romantic. Mo-

zart? No, Haydn. Can’t get 
’em. Noises, too. Whistles. I 
hear whistles.” 

“Whistles?” Carson said. 
“What kind of character is 
this? A wolf?” 

“Not that kind. Shrill, thin ' 
whistles, like something mov- 
ing high and fast. Real high 
up; sounds like fifty, sixty 
thousand feet . Music again. 
Can’t place ’em when I’m 
tight. He’s gone, anyway. Who 
was he?” 

“Damned if I know — just 
thought he looked interesting. 
Some executive, I bet; one of 
those hard faces. See if you 
can place that music.” 

“It’ll come, but not now. 
After I sober up. Think of ’em 
easy tomorrow. Know the 
stuff well. Glazounov, may- 
be?” 

“If you can’t, you can’t. I’ll 
get a line on the man. Maybe 
by Wednesday you — ” 

“Sure, I never miss, only 
I’m tight. Spent twenty years 
studying music. Should have 
my own ensemble. Better — 
shoulda learned to be a butch- 
er! Ever hear of a butcher 
going broke?” 

“You’ve made your point. 
Well, be here Wednesday at 
three. Stein and I might come 
up with a proposition.” They 
left. 

O N Wednesday they shared 
a table with Stein. 

Stein was a small, almost 
dwarfish man, redeemed from 
ugliness only by eyes which 

WORDS AND MUSIC 



were liquid brown 'add com- 
passionate. He drank milk 
“My stomach’s giving me 
hell,” he moaned. 

“Too bad,” Lane said po- 
litely, watching him with fur- 
tive awe. Stein’s income was 
reputed to exceed half a mil- 
lion yearly. 

“Isn’t it? Took me thirty 
years to afford decent food, 
and now I can’t eat it.” He 
gulped morosely. "It’s the 
strain. First World War II; 
then Korea; next Suez. Never 
any let-up. A man worries 
about his grandchildren. And 
no policy you can count on. 
We fight in Europe — we de- 
fend the U. S. only. Arm — 
stop arming. Make bigger 
bombs — junk ’ em all. The 
whole world’s crazy! Now 
Russia’s screaming at Eng- 
land and France again. Kick 
out the American missile 
bases, or we might have to at- 
tack. They say thirty or forty 
Russian rockets could destroy 
England and we’d have a 
rough time hitting back from 
here.” He glared at his glass. 
“And for a little splash milk, 
two dollars, the robbers!” 

“Don’t cry, Jimmy. You can 
afford it,” Carson grinned. 
“And quit worrying. Not even 
the Commies would wipe out 
France and kill Brigitte Bar- 
dot!” He winked at Lane. 
“Well, I identified our mys- 
tery man from the other day. 
If you spotted the music, let’s 
see how close they fit.” 

“You bet I got the music! 

83 




And I was close, too, tight or 
not. Funny thing, both pieces 
were about islands. Ain’t that 
something?” 

“Islands? I don’t see that. 
You must be off base this 
time, Lane.” 

“Like hell! I never miss. 
Rachmaninov : ‘The Isle of 
the Dead.’ That’s the Russian 
one. Remember, I mentioned 
Rachmaninov. Not so easy, 
but I’m sure now. The classic 
was no push-over, either. 
Haydn: ‘The Uninhabited Is- 
land.’ Gloomy, almost threat- 
ening readings. But those 
whistles high up don't mean 
a thing to me.” 

Carson’s face was sudden- 
ly gray and flaccid. “No,” he 
said half to himself. “They 



can’t be that crazy. It’s just 
more bluff!” 

Stein looked at him in mo- 
mentary wonder, and Lane 
thrust out his chin. 

“Ain’t I right?” he de- 
manded belligerently. “ ‘Isle of 
the Dead.’ ‘The Uninhabited 
Island.’ And forty whistling 
things high up. It’s gotta fit 
in somewhere. I’m never 
wrong on this stuff. Who was 
the guy, anyhow?” 

“The Russian Ambassador 
to England,” Carson said. 
“The one they just recalled.” 
They looked at each other in 
horror while Stein, hardly 
listening, his thoughts on the 
worrisome headlines, quietly 
sipped his milk. 

END 



THE IDEA THAT GREW AND GREW 

Back in 1910, Elmer A. Sperry, a doctor of engineering, decided to put 
a puzzling toy to work. The gyroscope had been invented centuries before 
by the Chinese, had fascinated many — scientists included — by its refusal 
to be anything but perpendicular, and its casual disregard of the mag- 
netic north pole. Sperry started the Sperry Gyroscope Company with 
one employee and a dinky low-rental office, and one job — a gyro-compass 
for the U.S.S. Delaware. When that proved successful, ships everywhere 
ordered these compasses that disregarded the buffeting of storms. 

Half a century of stabilizing everything from ships to spaceships has 
been anything but stabilizing for the Sperry outfit. It now has over 
100,000 employees in nearly 100 plants throughout the world, has passed 
the billion-dollar-a-year mark, and shows no signs of slowing down. 

What once was an item for Christmas stockings is an integral part 
of this missile, rocket and satellite age, perfectly obvious after Sperry 
put it to work, not before. Is there anything else as profitably lying 
around in nursery or rumpus room? Wouldn’t surprise us a bitl

ARTHUR PORGES 




Worlds of if 

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



W HOEVER “Sarban” may 
be, the novel The Sound 
of His Horn (Ballantine) is 
a valued addition to recent 
science fiction, once you get 
to it. 

This takes some bit of do- 
ing. The book has an intro- 
duction by Kingsley Amis 
(rather surgical in tone) and 
then Sarban has chosen to 
“frame” the story itself. 
( “ ‘Look here !’ He straight- 
ened up abruptly and turned 
round. ‘You’re not tired, are 
you? Mind if I tell you some- 
thing? Let me fill your glass, 
then sit down and I’ll tell you 
a tale.’ ” 

The effect is that one has 
made two false starts before 
beginning the story itself. 
And as the story takes some 
space to get where it is going, 
it seems possible that a num- 
ber of readers will wander off 
to the refrigerator and never 
quite get back. 

This would be a major loss. 
Once Sarban begins to get 
down to particulars, he re- 
veals a talent for horror that 
is all the more penetrating be- 
cause it is couched in a liter- 
ate and attractive style. It is 
Sarban’s purpose to explore 
what the world would have 
been like if the Nazis had won 



World War II. His draft of 
the consequences is convinc- 
ing and frightening. Inevita- 
bly the war was renamed, be- 
coming “The War of German 
Rights.” The victors have 
Nazified every spot on the 
globe; there is no longer an 
external enemy. Internal re- 
sistance is not ended, but it 
has come to take such shapes 
as conspiring to change the 
emphasis of a National-So- 
cialist slogan. Civil rights do 
not exist. In fact even the 
identity of non-Nazi groups 
has been so far suppressed 
that one character is unable 
to guess whether a group of 
slaves are Czechs, Russians or 
Chinese. He isn’t even inter- 
ested. “They seem to me very 
much just lumps of undiffer- 
entiated Under-Race.” 

There are many such 
glances at the outside world, 
but they are only glances. The 
main course of Sarban’s story 
concerns itself with the life 
of the great hunting preserve 
of the Reich Master Forester. 
Here the quarry is human — 
sometimes “lumps,” some- 
times criminals. Here are men 
like stags and girls like game 
birds, hunted by a scrupulous 
sporting code, making what 
lives they can out of what 



85 




little humanity is allowed 
them. 

The Sound of His Horn, a 
slim book to begin with, 
spends more than a quarter 
of its pages on introduction, 
prologue and epilogue. What 
is left is not much over nov- 
elette length, and so there is 
not the space for a detailed 
study in full dress. It hints 
and evokes, instead of stat- 
ing. It may sometimes leave 
one unsatisfied; but it will 
hardly leave anyone unmoved. 

IN A remarkably irritating 
new book, Stadium Beyond 
the Stars (Winston), Milton 
Lesser proposes to tell us 
about a group of young ath- 
letes en route from Earth to 
“Ophiuchus” to take part in 
Interstellar Olympics. That’s 
what he proposes. What he 
accomplishes is something 
else again. The athletic-com- 
petition theme drops from 
sight almost at once, flickers 
briefly a time or two and then 
is seen no more. Instead 
Lesser gives us a stale hash 
of menacing aliens. 

Stadium Beyond the Stars 
moves its thin, pale plot 
along only with the help of 
fantastic amounts of snoop- 
ing, skulking, eavesdropping 
and shadowing. Everybody is 
always following everybody 
else around in the shadows, 
and what they learn from this 
your reviewer cannot tell, for 
a careful study shows that if 
every character in the book 

86 



had slept through its action, 
the end position of all parties 
would have been just about 
the same. 

The story is classified as 
“young adult” reading — that 
is to say, it is ostensibly aimed 
at the later teens and actually 
is read mostly by twelve-year- 
olds. If a science fiction writ- 
er has any responsibility at all 
to keep his facts straight, it 
would seem that the respon- 
sibility is gravest of all in 
stories aimed at the young. 

To this ideal Lesser comes 
nowhere near. There aren’t 
very many factual statements 
in Stadium Beyond the Stars, 
only doubletalk; but even the 
doubletalk is in its implica- 
tions absurdly wrong. It 
would be easy to draw up a 
list of a dozen instances of 
this, but as it would also be 
repetitious let one suffice. 

One of Lesser’s characters 
is a space captain who sights 
a derelict ; he wishes to match 
course and board it. The dere- 
lict is comparatively motion- 
less and the space captain’s 
command is traveling at 
“barely sublight speed,” so 
Lesser rightly supposes that 
some time will be necessary 
for deceleration. How is this 
done? Lesser says first the 
space captain circles back 
to the derelict, then goes 
through the long deceleration. 

Not only does Lesser tam- 
per with awfully elementary 
science, he hardly troubles to 
remember his own inventions. 

FREDERIK POHL 




It is not ignorance that is 
demonstrated here. It is con- 
tempt. Contempt for his me- 
dium. Contempt for his 
readers. Contempt for his 
own story. 

What is even more incred- 
ible is the necessary assump- 
tion that someone read this 
before allowing it to get into 
print. Does Winston have an 
editor? If so, does the editor 
edit? 

WELL, MAYBE he does. It 
is satisfying to be able to re- 
port that another Winston 
writer (and another writer 
who is sometimes less than 
sensible with his “science”) 
has done a fine, competent job 
in a second Winston juvenile. 

The author is Robert Sil- 
verberg; the book is Lost Race 
of Mars. The book is fun. 
Listed as for the “8 to 12” 
group, it will most likely be 
read by the first-graders and 
read to the pre-schoolers. 
They will like it very much. 
Possibly they will sometimes 
have a little trouble with its 
vocabulary. They should ; 
that’s how kids learn. 

In Lost Race of Mars Sil- 
verberg invents a likable 
family who, for persuasive 
reasons, travel to a well- 
thought-out and well-describ- 
ed Martian settlement. They 
are pioneers and, as it turns 
out, discoverers. What they 
discover is the “Lost Race” of 
the title. 

This is all very simple, of 

WORLDS OF IF 



course. The plot is not simple 
because Robert Silverberg is 
too feckless to invent a com- 
plicated one; it is simple be- 
cause he has the wisdom to 
realize complications would be 
out of place. All in all, Silver- 
berg does this book so well 
that he makes it look easy; 
pray heaven it is — for him — 
because then we can hope 
that he will do many more. 

ANOTHER WINSTON juve- 
nile, now reissued by Signet, 
is Arthur C. Clarke’s Islands 
in the Sky. A youngster en- 
ters a quiz contest and wins 
the great prize, which is a 
trip to a space satellite. 
Through accident, helped by 
youthful guile, he stretches 
the trip to include half a doz- 
en, all described with Clarke’s 
splendidly matter-of-fact de- 
tail. 

It is an entertaining book 
even for adult readers, once 
they reconcile themselves to 
a teen-age level of plot and 
character; but it does seem 
deceitful of Signet to publish 
it without a single hint any- 
where that it was designed 
for a juvenile audience. 

IN ALGIS BUDRYS’S The 
Unexpected Dimension (Bal- 
lantine), the unexpected com- 
mon feature of its seven 
stories is remorse. His heroes 
have variously founded socie- 
ties, invented world-shaking 
machines, served false ideals 
of justice, etc. Whatever they 

87 




did, they did it before the 
story opens, and they’re sorry 
for it now. 

The stories themselves are 
fine. Budrys walks a crooked 
mile to get from beginning to 
end of a story, but the de- 
tours are not without point 
and never without power. 

Philip Jose Farmer’s 
Strange Relations (Ballan- 
tine) is a collection of five 
short pieces arranged in the 
form of a family album: the 
stories are Mother, Daughter, 
Father, Son and My Sister’s 
Brother. (The last two have 
had their titles forcibly 
wrenched into conformity 
with the pattern.) 

Farmer is an important 
writer, who repays study. He 
is, it is true, an acquired 
taste, but that is only another 
way of saying that he is his 
own writer instead of being a 
copy of someone else. In his 
work are several highly in- 
dividual qualities — one, an 
explicit curiosity about re- 
production and elimination ; 
two, an astute knack for in- 
venting alien biology; three, 
an obsessive concern for the 
subconscious wounds which 
express themselves in the hu- 
man sum called “personality.” 

Nearly all of Farmer’s 
aliens are meticulously and 
brightly drawn. Nearly all of 
his humans have pockets of 
rot in their brains which seep 
through, polluting their ac- 
tions. No matter what great 
struggles his characters may 

88 



engage in in the physical 
world, their real battle is al- 
ways with the wild black 
storms that scourge their 
minds. 

Very much like Farmer in 
his inventive care, C. S. Lewis 
is utterly unlike him in 
orientation. Avon has just re- 
issued Lewis’s Out of the 
Silent Planet, which demon- 
strates that science fiction can 
be used to bring us closer to 
God. Surprisingly, it also dem- 
onstrates that a theological 
tract can be a fine, entertain- 
ing novel. 

AVON’S NEWEST Double 
Novel combines George O. 
Smith and A. E. van Vogt, 
both doing what they do best. 

Smith’s Lost in Space is a 
first-contact story with a gen- 
erous overlayer of interstellar 
navigation theory. It is not a 
major work, but it is not in 
any way a dull one. 

Van Vogt is . van Vogt. 
The name of the story is 
Earth’s Last Fortress. The 
plot concerns a great strug- 
gle in some future age, in- 
volving the totality of human 
history on one side or anoth- 
er. It contains all of van 
Vogt’s usual deadpan over- 
statement. When a character 
is surprised, it is by “the 
deadliest shock that had ever 
stabbed into a human brain.” 
When a character is confused, 
“His brain was an opaque 
mass flecked with the moving 
lights of thoughts, heavy with 

FREDERIK POHL 




the gathering pall of his sus- 
picion, knowing finally only 
one certainty.” 

Certainly van Vogt creates 
an urgency in almost every- 
thing he writes; it may be 
that these crushingly insensi- 
tive phrases are necessary to 
create that urgency. It may 
be, indeed, that the only prop- 
er verdict on van Vogt is an 
Irishism: If van Vogt were 
a better writer, he would be 
a worse one. 

IN THE seven stories in Out 
of Bounds (Pyramid), Judith 
Merril demonstrates a relia- 
ble French saying: The more 
it changes, the more it’s the 
same thing. Her stories are 
different as different can be 
in plot structure, theme and 
character. Yet they are very 
much the same in effect, and 
the reason is the overpower- 
ing subjectivity of her writ- 
ing. What she has to sell is 
not adventure or speculation. 
It is emotion ... a fine thing 
in measured doses, but may- 
be too saturating for a collec- 
tion. 

Which also pretty much 
applies to A Medicine for 
Melancholy, Ray Bradbury’s 
short story collection now re- 
issued by Bantam. The stories 
are short and varied — pas- 
tiches, vignettes, O. Henrys, 
gleanings of autobiography — 
but every one of them is cap- 
able of delivering a jolt to the 
glands. It is useless to try to 
evaluate Bradbury as a sci- 

WORLDS OF IF 



ence fiction writer. What he 
knows of science you could 
put in your eye, and what he 
cares about it is less. A story 
like Dark They Were, and 
Golden-Eyed — Earthmen, by 
virtue of settling on Mars, 
turn into Martians — makes 
no sense at all, but it gener- 
ates a mood well and moving- 
ly. But twenty-two of these in 
a row? 

Miss Merril has another 
book for us this month. This 
one is a novel, again published 
by Pyramid, most unpromis- 
ingly entitled The Tomorrow 
People. 

What the title seems to sug- 
gest is a sort of lackluster 
cuteness, quaint and folksy. 
The suggestion is a libel. The 
book is a real piece of work. 
The themes the author weaves 
into the structure are impor- 
tant and fresh; her charac- 
ters are drawn in depth. All 
in all, it is the biggest, prob- 
ably the best, piece of work 
we have seen from her since 
Shadow on the Hearth. 

The locale wanders across 
the face of the Earth and out 
into space. The themes are 
space travel, politics and 
biology — both non-human and 
all too human. It is quite a 
can of worms the author has 
opened here, but she is equal 
to it. The elements are laid in 
place with skill (barring an 
occasional lapse like “helicop- 
ter” for a vehicle in which to 
travel about the face of the 
Moon) and all the radiating 

89 




threads draw neatly together 
at the end; she has not mere- 
ly given her story a conclu- 
sion, she has provided it with 
a climax. You will find the 
book worth reading. 

You may also find, how- 
ever, that you wish you had 
a road map now and again. 
Here too the author salts the 
stew with a heavy dose of 
character introspection and 
emotion ; she will not — will 
wot— tell you what is happen- 
ing in her story ; she will only 
tell you what her characters 
think about it all. The charac- 
ters talk endlessly — not only 
aloud. After every line of 
dialogue is another line, in 
italics, to let you know what 
they mean. (Special attention 
is invited to page 20. This 
page has no italics, and it 
seems to be the only one of its 
kind in the book.) Finally, the 
author has adopted a “teaser” 
style of narration in which 
nearly all the relevant infor- 
mation about what is going 
on is concealed from the 
reader. 

All this makes thorny go- 
ing, but there are roses. 

CHARLES ERIC MAINE’S 
Fire Past the Future (and 
what does that mean?) in- 
volves a nuclear device at 
work on a remote Pacific atoll. 
The device is not a bomb. It 
is a time machine. The whole 
island is interdicted for se- 
curity reasons and Maine thus 
creates a closed universe in 

90 



which to set his story. The 
story itself is a whodunit. 

In another Ballantine novel, 
Chad Oliver continues to put 
his anthropology degree to 
excellent use. The story is 
Unearthly Neighbors, a de- 
tailed examination into first 
contact between Earth and the 
long-armed, toolless, tribal in- 
habitants of Sirius IX. Other 
science fiction writers have 
invented more “alien” aliens 
than these for us to make 
contact with. Few, though, 
have been as able as Oliver to 
convince us that this is the 
way first contact is going to 
be. 

In a twin bill, Robert Moore 
Williams gives us World of 
the Masterminds, a novel, and 
To the End of Time, a short 
story collection (Ace). Wil- 
liams is always a competent 
writer and sometimes a mov- 
ing one, but in these he has 
sacrificed everything to speed 
and action. When the Earth- 
men and the aliens have fin- 
ished bopping each other over 
the head, the battlefield is left 
a clutter of begged questions 
and abandoned premises. 

A properly ordered Hallow- 
e’en will have a gathering of 
congenial persons (for exam- 
ple, science fiction writers) , a 
supply of suitable refreshment 
(for example, cider spiked 
with applejack) to make them 
merry, and suitable entertain- 
ment (for example, ghost 
stories) to make them creep. 
As a purveyor of this sort of 

FREDERIK POHL 




entertainment, Basil Daven- 
port has no equal. Here, in 
the abridged version of Tales 
to Be Told in the Dark (Bal- 
lantine), eleven of his most 
successful opera are repro- 
duced, with hints from the 
master on how to congeal an 
audience. Davenport means 
the stories to be told aloud, 
but you will find them almost 
as much fun to read. 

From Ace another double 
volume : Andre Norton on one 
side, Richard Wilson on the 
other. The Wilson is And 
Then the Town Took Off; it 
has all of his virtues — grace, 
smoothness and ease — and all 
of his faults, the worst of 
which is a reluctance to dig 
beneath the surface. And 
Then the Town Took Off is 
about — well, about a town 
that takes off. It disappears; 
aliens have burrowed beneath 
it and floated it away into the 
sky. There is then a struggle 
to get it back with battles be- 
tween nations (it drifts to- 
ward Russia) and among the 
parts of the administration of 
our own. It is all witty and 
bright and disappointing only 
because you can’t help feeling 
the man can do more. 

Much the same can be said 
about the other occupant of 
this book, Andre Norton. Her 
story is The Sioux Spaceman 
and the title again tells you 
about all you need to know. 
She does not falter in her 
word-handling or her under- 
standing of her characters;

ginning that this book is go- 
ing to operate safely in con- 
ventional areas, then you will 
enjoy both ends of the vol- 
ume. 

SOME BOOKS are meant for 
the ages ; some age more rap- 
idly than bakery bread. A 
book which should be read 
immediately, before it grows 
stale, is the collection of 
essays on nuclear weapons and 
their effects, edited by John 
M. Fowler and published by 
Basic Books under the title of 
Fallout. 

The title is misleading. Ac- 
tually of twelve chapters only 
a few are concerned with the 
rain of fission products that 
is seeping into our bones. The 
others have more urgent dan- 
gers to discuss. 

It is true, say the authors, 
that fallout is killing some 
thousands of persons, mostly 
children. “Military prepared- 
ness inevitably costs lives : 
there are some 1,400 deaths 
each year in our armed forces 
from peacetime accidents.” 
However much we may dis- 
like the probability that one 
additional child in each aver- 
age community will contract 
leukemia from the fission 
products over the next few 
years, Ralph Lapp’s chapter, 
sketching the probable face of 
nuclear war, makes it clear 
that the real thing to fear 
from The Bomb is The Bomb 
itself. 



91 




Let us suppose war comes. 
First there would be the heat, 
igniting every inflammable 
object over some 5,000 square 
miles. Then the firestorm (in 
cities at least) , killing the 
unburned survivors by as- 
phyxiation, sucking all the 
oxygen out of the air. Then 
the blast, extending in some 
degree as far as a hundred 
miles from the burst. Then 
the fallout. This is the pattern 
of one bomb. It needs to be 
multiplied by scores or hun- 
dreds. 

John Fowler takes up the 
story with a chapter on the 
prospects of national survival 
after a nuclear war. He 
posits a hypothetical 1,400- 
megaton attack (probably 
smallish, as against what 
might be delivered) that was 
imagined to have taken place 
on October 17th, 1958. To fill 
out the picture of the if -world 
results, weather records were 
consulted, tracing the wind- 
driven pattern of fallout, 
estimating what aid might 
have come from rain or storm 
to help control the resulting 
fires. 

The answer is not encour- 
aging. Fowler quotes from 
Congressional testimony of 
John N. Wolfe on this point: 
“It is most likely, in my opin- 
ion, that these fires would go 
unquenched until checked by 
the winter snows, spreading 
over hundreds of thousands of 
square miles . With the 
coming of spring thaws, espe- 

92 



daily in the mountains, melt- 
water from the mountain 
glaciers and snowfields would 
erode the denuded slopes, 
flood the valleys, in time ren- 
dering them uninhabitable 
and unexploitable for decades 
or longer ... I visualize those 
persons unsheltered in heavy 
fallout areas after three 
months to be dead, dying, 
sick or helpless; those shel- 
tered, if they can psychologi- 
cally withstand confinement 
for that period, will emerge 
to a strange landscape. The 
sun will shine through a dust- 
laden atmosphere; the land- 
scape in mid-January would 
be snow-covered or blackened 
by fire; at higher latitudes 
blizzards and sub-zero tem- 
perature would add death and 
discomfort; both food and 
shelter would be inadequate 
and production incapacitat- 
ed.” 

There is very little comfort 
to be found in this book for 
those who, like Edward Teller, 
suggest “conventions” to lim- 
it the use of nuclear weapons, 
or for those who minimize 
the effect of nuclear war on 
the total history of a nation. 
It would be only an episode, 
they say ; it would not destroy 
a country. Would it? “If a 
nuclear war could not destroy 
civilization and the economy 
in the warring countries, then 
perhaps we do not understand 
what is meant by civilization 
and national economy,” says 
Fowler.

The list of contributors is 
distinguished and expert ; and 
there is an introduction by 
Adlai Stevenson, reminding 
us (with manfully concealed 
self-righteousness) that the 
same administration which in 
1956 sternly rebuked him for 
proposing an end to bomb 
tests in 1958 put his sugges- 
tion into practice. The hope- 
ful implication is that some 
of the frightening faces the 
world’s governments are mak- 
ing at each other are only for 
effect; reason may ultimately 
prevail, as it has in the sus- 
pension of testing. It is good 
to have this hopeful implica- 
tion. It is about the only one 
to be found in the book. 

NEW AMERICAN LI- 
BRARY, which has given list 
room to both the “Steady- 
State” hypothesis of perma- 
nent creation (Fred Hoyle) 
and to its “Big Bang” theory 
adversaries (George Gamow), 
now offers equal time to a 
proponent of the Middle Way. 

In The Oscillating Universe, 
Ernst J. Opik accepts the 
hypothesis of creation of the 
galaxies from the explosion 
of a “primordial atom.” (This 
is the “Big Bang” hypothes- 
is.) But, he says, this was 
not a unique event. The uni- 
verse does not have a begin- 
ning and an end; like Hoyle, 
he believes it goes on forever. 
That exploding “atom” which 
produced the expanding uni- 
verse, says Opik, was itself 

WORLDS OF IF 



formed from the contraction 
of a universe before ours — 
which itself had been born in 
a “Big Bang” — had then ex- 
panded to the limits gravita- 
tion would allow — and had 
then collapsed, thus generat- 
ing another “atom.” 

Further, he says this is the 
fate of our own universe and 
all the universes yet to come. 
“Some 25,000 million years 
from now the Day of Reckon- 
ing will come. The whole uni- 
verse — all galaxies with their 
suns shining or extinct, their 
planets dead or still carrying 
life on their surface — will 
precipitate itself into a nar- 
row space, almost a point. 
Everything will perish in a 
fiery chaos well before the 
point of greatest compression 
is reached. All bodies and all 
atoms of the world will dis- 
solve into the nuclear fluid of 
the primeval atom — which in 
this case is not truly primeval 
— and a new expanding 
world will surge from it, like 
Phoenix out of the ashes, re- 
juvenated and full of creative 
vigor.” 

Like Gamow and Hoyle, 
Opik has coated his cosmog- 
ony with a layer of popular- 
ized astrophysics, very well 
done and very informative. 
New American Library has 
much to be proud of in pre- 
senting three such articulate 
and persuasive scientists. It’s 
too bad that at least two of 
them must necessarily be 
wrong. end

Star 

Performer 



By ROBERT J. SHEA 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 

G AVIR gingerly fitted the 
round opening in the bot- 
tom of the silvery globe over 
the top of his hairless blue 
skull. He pulled the globe 
down until he felt tiny fila- 
ments touching his scalp. The 
tips of the wires were cold. 

The moderator then said, 
" Dreaming Through the Uni- 
verse tonight brings you the 
first native Martian to appear 
on the dreamwaves — Gavir of 
the Desert Men. With him is 
his guardian, Dr. Malcomb 
Rice, the noted anthropolo- 
gist.” 

Then the moderator ques- 



Blue Boy’s rating was high 



and his fans were loyal to 



the death — anyonefs death!

tioned Malcomb, while Gavir 
nervously awaited the moment 
when his thoughts would be 
transmitted to millions of 
Earthmen. Malcomb told how 
he had been struck by Gavir’s 
intelligence and missionary- 
taught ability to speak Earth’s 
language, and had decided to 
bring Gavir to Earth. 

The moderator turned to 
Gavir. “Are you anxious to 
get back to Mars?” 

No! Gavir thought. Back 
behind the Preserve Barrier 
that killed you instantly if you 
stepped too close to it? Back 
to the constant fear of being 
seized by MDC guards for a 
labor pool, to wind up in the 
MDC mines? 

Mars was where Gavir’s 
father had been pinned, bay- 
onets through his hands and 
feet, to the wall of a shack 
just the other side of the Bar- 
rier, to die slowly, out of Ga- 
vir’s reach. Father James told 
Gavir that the head of MDC 
himself had ordered the kill- 
ing, because Gavir’s father 
had tried to organize resist- 
ance to the Corporation. Mars 
was where the magic powers 
of the Earthmen and the help- 
lessness of the Martian tribes 
would always protect the head 
of MDC from Gavir’s venge- 
ance. 

Back to that world of hope- 
less fear and hatred? I never 
want to go back to Mars! I 
want to stay here! 

But that wasn’t what he 
was supposed to think. Quick- 



ly he said, “I will be happy to 
return to my people.” 

A movement caught his 
eye. The producer, reclining 
on a divan in a far corner of 
the small studio, was making 
some kind of signal by beating 
his fist against his forehead. 

“Well, enough of that!” the 
moderator said briskly. “How 
about singing one of your tri- 
bal songs for us?” 

Gavir said, “I will sing the 
Song of Going to Hunt.” He 
heaved himself up from the 
divan, and, feet planted wide 
apart, threw back his head 
and began to howl. 

He was considered a poor 
singer in his tribe, and he was 
not surprised that Malcomb 
and the moderator winced. 
But Malcomb had told him 
that it wouldn’t matter. The 
dreamees receiving the dream- 
cast would hear the song as 
it should sound, as Gavir 
heard it in his mind. Every- 
thing that Gavir saw and 
heard and felt in his mind, the 
dreamees could see and hear 
and feel . 

I T WAS cold, bitter cold, on 
the plain. The hunter stood 
at the edge of the camp as the 
shriveled Martian sun struck 
the tops of the Shakam hills. 
The hunter hefted the long, 
balanced narvoon, the throw- 
ing knife, in his hand. He had 
faith in the knife, and in his 
skill with it. 

The hunter filled his lungs, 
the cold air reaching deep into 



96 



ROBERT J. SHEA 




his chest. He shouted out his 
throat-bursting hunting cry. 
He began to run across the 
plain. 

Crouching behind crum- 
bling red rocks, racing over 
flat expanses of orange sand, 
the hunter sought traces of 
the seegee, the great slow des- 
ert beast whose body provid- 
ed his tribe with all the essen- 
tials of existence. At last he 
saw tracks. He mounted a 
dune. Out on the plain before 
him a great brown seegee lum- 
bered patiently, unaware of 
its danger. 

The hunter was about to 
strike out after it, when a 
dark form leaped at him. 

The hunter saw it out of the 
corner of his eye at the last 
moment. His startled sidestep 
saved him from the neck- 
breaking snap of the great 
jaws. 

The drock’s long body was 
armored with black scales. 
Curving fangs protruded 
from its upper jaw. Its hand- 
like forepaws ended in hooked 
claws, to grasp and tear its 
prey. It was larger, stronger, 
faster than the hunter. The 
thin Martian air carried 
weirdly high-pitched cries 
which proclaimed its craving 
to sink its fangs into the 
hunter’s body. The drock’s 
huge hind legs coiled back on 
their triple joints, and it 
sprang. 

The hunter thrust the 
gleaming knife out before 
him, so that the dark body 

STAR PERFORMER 



would land on its gleaming 
blade. The drock twisted in 
mid-air and landed to one side 
of the hunter. 

Now, before it could gather 
itself for another spring, there 
was time for one cast of the 
blade. It had to be done at 
once. It had to be perfect. If 
it failed, the knife would be 
lost and the drock would have 
its kill. The hunter grasped 
the weapon by the blade, drew 
his arm back, and snapped it 
forward. 

The blade struck deep into 
the throat of the drock. 

The drock screamed eerily 
and jumped clumsily. The 
hunter threw himself at the 
great, dark body and retriev- 
ed the knife. He struck with 
it again and again into the 
gray twitching belly. Color- 
less blood ran out over the 
hard, tightly-stretched skin. 

The drock fell gave a last 
convulsion, and lay still. The 
hunter plunged the blade into 
the red sand to clean it. He 
threw back his head and bel- 
lowed his hunting cry. There 
was great glory in killing the 
drock, for it showed that the 
Desert Man and not the drock, 
was lord of the red waste . 

G AVIR sat down on the 
divan, exhausted, his song 
finished. He didn’t hear the 
moderator winding up the 
dreamcast. Then the producer 
of the program was upon 
him. 

He began shouting even be- 

97 




fore Gavir removed his head- 
set. “What kind of a fool are 
you? Before you started that 
song, you dreamed things 
about the Martian Develop- 
ment Corporation that were 
libelous ! I got the whole thing 
— the Barrier, the guards, the 
labor pools and mines, the 
father crucified. It was awful ! 
MDC is one of our biggest 
sponsors.” 

Malcomb said, “You can’t 
expect an untrained young 
Martian to control his very 
thoughts. And may I point 
out that your tone is hostile?” 

At this a sudden change 
came over the producer. The 
standard Earth expression — 
invincible benignity — took 
control of his face. “I apolo- 
gize for having spoken sharp- 
ly, but dreamcasting is a 
nerve-wracking business. If it 
weren’t for Ethical Condi- 
tioning, I don’t know how I’d 
control my aggressive im- 
pulses. The Suppression of 
Aggression is the Foundation 
of Civilization, eh?” 

Malcomb smiled. “Ethical 
Conditioning Keeps Society 
from Fissioning.” He shook 
hands with the producer. 

“Come around tomorrow at 
1.300 and collect your fee,” 
said the producer. “Good 
night, gentlemen.” 

As they left the Global 
Dreamcasting System build- 
ing, Gavir said to Malcomb, 
“Can we go to a bookstore 
tonight?” 

“Tomorrow. I’m taking you 



to your hotel and then I’m go- 
ing back to my apartment. We 
both need sleep. And don’t for- 
get, you’ve been warned not to 
go prowling around the city 
by yourself ...” 

As soon as Gavir was sure 
that Malcomb was out of the 
hotel and well on his way 
home, he left his room and 
went out into the city. 

In a pitifully few days he 
would be back in the Preserve, 
back with the fear of MDC, 
with hunger and the hopeless 
desire to find and kill the man 
who had ordered his father’s 
death. 

Now he had an oppor- 
tunity to learn more about the 
universe of the Earthmen. De- 
spite Malcomb’s orders, he 
was going to find a seller of 
books. 

During a reading class at 
the mission school, Father 
James had said, “In books 
there is power. All that you 
call magic in our Earth civi- 
lization is explained in books.” 
Gavir wanted to learn. It was 
his only hope to find an alter- 
native to the short, fear-rid- 
den, impoverished life he 
foresaw for himself. 

A river of force carried 
him, along with thousands of 
Earthmen — godlike beings in 
their perfect health and 
their impregnable benignity — 
through the streets of the city. 
Platforms of force raised and 
lowered him through the 
city’s multiple levels . 

And, as has always happen- 

ROBERT J. SHEA 



98 




ed to outlandefs in cities, he 
became lost. 

H E WAS in a quarter where 
furtive red and violet 
lights danced in the shadows 
of hunched buildings. A half- 
dozen Earthmen approached 
him, stopped and stared. Ga- 
vir stared back. 

The Earthmen wore black 
garments and furs and metal 
ornaments. The biggest of 
them wore a black suit, a long 
black cape, and a broad-brim- 
med black hat. He carried a 
coiled whip in one hand. The 
Earthmen turned to one an- 
other. 

“A Martian.” 

“Let’s give pain and death 
to the Martian! It will be a 
new experience — one to sa- 
vor.” 

“Take pain, Martian!” 

The Earthman with the 
black hat raised his arm, and 
the long heavy lash fell on 
Gavir. He felt a savage sting 
in the arm he had thrown up 
to protect his eyes. 

Gavir leaped at the Earth- 
men. He clubbed the man with 
the whip across the face. As 
the others rushed in, Gavir 
flailed about him with long 
arms and heavy fists. 

He began to enjoy it. It was 
rare that a Martian had an 
opportunity to knock Earth- 
men down. The mood of the 
Song of Going to Hunt came 
over him. He sprang free of 
his attackers and drew his 
glittering narvoon. 

STAR PERFORMER 



The man with the whip 

S lled. They looked at his 
ife, and then all at once 
turned and ran. Gavir drew 
back his arm and threw the 
knife with a practiced cata- 
pult-snap of shoulder, elbow, 
and wrist. To his surprise, the 
blade clattered to the street 
far short of his retreating eixe- 
mies. Then he remembered": 
you couldn’t throw far in the 
gravity of Earth. 

The Earthmen disappeared 
into a lift-force field. Gavir 
decided not to pursue them. 
He walked forward and pick- 
ed up his narvoon, and saw 
that the street on which it lay 
was solid black pavement, not 
a force-field. He must be in 
the lowest level of the city. He 
didn’t know his way around ; 
he might meet more enemies. 
He forgot about the books he’d 
wanted, and began to search 
for his hotel. 

W HEN he got back to his 
room, he went immediate- 
ly to bed. He slept late. 

Malcomb woke him at 1100. 
Gavir told Malcomb about the 
strangely-dressed men who 
had tried to kill him. 

“I told you not to wander 
around alone.” 

“But you did not tell me that 
Earthmen might try to kill 
me. You have told me that 
Earthmen are good and peace- 
loving, that there have been 
no acts of violence on Earth 
for many decades. You have 
told me that only the MDC 

99 




men are exceptions, because 
they are living off Earth, and 
this somehow makes them di- 
fferent.” 

“Well, those people you ran 
into are another exception.” 

“Why?” 

“You know about the Re- 
generation and Rejuvenation 
treatment we have here on 
Earth. A variation of it was 
given you to acclimate you to 
Earth’s gravity and atmos- 
phere. Well, since the R&R 
treatment was developed, we 
Earthmen have a life-expec- 
tancy of about one hundred 
fifty years. Those people who 
attacked you were Century- 
Plus. They are over a hundred 
years old, but as healthy, 
physically, as ever.” 

“What is wrong with 
them?” 

“They seem to have out- 
grown their Ethical Condi- 
tioning. They live wildly. 
Violently. It’s a problem with- 
out precedent, and we don’t 
know what to do with them. 
The fact is, Senile Delinquen- 
cy is our number one prob- 
lem.” 

“Why not punish them?” 
said Gavir. 

“They’re too powerful. They 
are often people who’ve pur- 
sued successful careers and 
acquired a good deal of prop- 
erty and position. And there 
are getting to be more of them 
all the time. But come on. 
You and I have to go over to 
Global Dreamcasting and col- 
lect our fee.” 



T HE impeccably affable pro- 
ducer of Dreaming 
Through the Universe gave 
Malcomb a check and then 
asked them to follow him. 

“Mr. Davery wants to see 
you. Mr. Hoppy Davery, ex- 
ecutive vice-president in 
charge of production. Scion 
of one of Earth’s oldest com- 
munications media families !” 
They went with the pro- 
ducer to the upper reaches of 
the Global Dreamcasting 
building. There they were 
ushered into a huge office. 

They found Mr. Hoppy 
Davery lounging on a divan 
the size of a space-port. He 
was youthful in appearance, 
as were all Earthmen, but a 
soft plumpness and a receding 
hairline made him look slight- 
ly older than average. 

He pointed a rigid finger at 
Malcomb and Gavir. “I want 
you two to hear a condensed 
recording of statements taken 
from calls we received last 
night.” 

Gavir stiffened. They had 
gotten into trouble because of 
his thoughts about MDC. 

A voice boomed out of the 
ceiling. 

“That Martian boy has 
power. That song was a fist 
in the jaw. More!” 

A woman’s voice followed: 
“If you let that boy go back 
to Mars I’ll never dream a 
Global program again.” 

More voices: 

“Enormous!” 

“Potent!”

“That hunting song drove 
me mad. I like being mad!" 

“Keep him on Earth.” 

Hoppy Davery pressed a 
button in the control panel on 
his divan, and the voices fell 
silent. 

“Those callers that admit- 
ted their age were all Cen- 
tury-Plus. The boy appeals to 
the Century-Plus mentality. I 
want to try him again. This 
time on a really big dream- 
show, not just an educational 
'cast. Got a spot on next 
week’s Farfel Flisket Show. 
If he gets the right response, 
we talk about a contract. 
Okay?” 

Malcomb said, “His visa ex- 
pires—” 

“We’ll take care of his 
visa.” 

Gavir trembled with joy. 
Hoppy Davery pressed anoth- 
er button and a secretary 
entered with papers. She was 
followed by another woman. 

The second woman was 
dark-haired and slender. She 
wore leather boots and tight 
brown breeches. She was bare 
from the waist up and her 
breasts were young and full. 
A jewelled clip fastened a 
scarlet cape at her neck. Her 
lips were a disconcertingly 
vivid red, apparently an arti- 
ficial color. She kissed Hoppy 
Davery on the forehead, leav- 
ing red blotches on his pink 
dome. He wiped his forehead 
and looked at his hand. 

“Do you have to wear that 
barbaric face-paint?” Hoppy 

STAR PERFORMER 



turned sad eyes on Gavir and 
Malcomb. “Gentlemen, my 
mother, Sylvie Davery.” 

A Senile Delinquent! 
thought Gavir. She looked like 
Davery’s younger sister. Mal- 
comb stared at her apprehen- 
sively, and Gavir wondered if 
she were somehow going to 
attack them. 

She looked at Gavir. “Mmm. 
What a body, what gorgeous 
blue skin. How tall are you, 
Blue Boy?” 

“He’s approximately seven 
feet tall, Sylvie,” said Hoppy, 
“and what do you want here, 
anyway?” 

“Just came up to see Blue 
Boy. One of the crowd dream- 
ed him last night. Positively 
manic about him. I found out 
he’d be with you.” 

“See?” said Hoppy to Ga- 
vir. “The Century-Plus men- 
tality. You’ve got something 
they go for. Undoubtedly be- 
cause you’re — forgive me — 
such a complete barbarian. 
That’s what they’re all trying 
to be.” 

“Spare me another lecture 
on Senile Delinquency, Our 
Number One Problem.” She 
walked to the door and Gavir 
watched her all the way. She 
turned with a swirl of scarlet 
and a dramatic display of 
healthy young flesh. “See you 
again. Blue Boy.” 

After Sylvie left, Hoppy 
Davery said, “That might be 
a good professional name — 
Blue Boy. Gavir doesn’t mean 
anything. Now what kind of 

101 




a song could you do for the 
Farfel Flisket show?” 

Gavir thought. “Perhaps 
you would like the Song of 

Creation.” 

“It's part of a fertility 
rite,” Malcomb explained. 

“Great! Give the Senile De- 
linquents another workout. 
It’s not quite ethical, but its 
good for us. But for heaven’s 
sake, Blue Boy, keep your 
mind off MDC!” 

T HE following week, Gavir 
sang the Song of Creation 
on the Farfel Flisket show, 
and transmitted the images 
which it brought up in his 
mind to his audience. A jubi- 
lant Hoppy Davery called him 
at his hotel next morning. 

“Best response I’ve ever 
seen ! The Century-Plussers 
have been rioting and throw- 
ing mass orgies every since 
you sang. But they take time 
out to call us up and beg for 
more. I’ve got a sponsor and 
a two-year contract lined up 
for you.” 

The sponsor was pacing 
back and forth in Hoppy 
Davery’s office when Mal- 
comb and Gavir arrived. Hop- 
py introduced him proudly. 
“Mr. Jarvis Spurling, presi- 
dent of the Martian Develop- 
ment Corporation.” 

Gavir’s hand leaped at the 
narvoon under his doublet. 

Then he stopped himself. 
He turned the gesture into the 
proffer of a handshake. “How 
do you do?” he said quietly, 

102 



In his mind he congratulated 
himself. He had learned emo- 
tional control from the Earth- 
men. Here was the man who 
had ordered his father cruci- 
fied! Yet he had managed to 
hide his instant desire to 
strike, to kill, to carry out the 
oath of the blood feud then 
and there. 

Jarvis Spurling ignored 
Gavir's hand and stared cold- 
ly at him. There was not a 
trace of the usual Earthman’s 
kindliness in his square, bat- 
tered face. “I’m told you got 
talent. Okay, but a Bluie is a 
Bluie. I’ll pay you because a 
Bluie on Dreamvision is good 
publicity for MDC products. 
But one slip like on your first 
’cast and you go back to the 
Preserve.” 

“Mr. Spurling!” said Mal- 
comb. “Your tone is hostile!” 

“Damn right. That Ethical 
Conditioning slop doesn’t 
work on me. I’ve lived too 
long on the frontier. And I 
know Bluies.” 

<<T WILL sign the contract,” 

A said Gavir. 

As he drew his signature 
pictograph on the contract, 
Sylvie Davery sauntered in. 
She held a white tube between 
her painted lips. The end of 
the tube was glowing and giv- 
ing off clouds of smoke. Hop- 
py Davery coughed and Syl- 
vie winked at Gavir. Gavir 
straightened up, and she to:': 
a long look at his seven feet. 

“All finished, Blue Boy? 

ROBERT J. SHEA 




Come on, let’s go have a drink 
at Lucifer Grotto.” 

Caution told Gavir to re- 
fuse. But before he could 
speak Spurling snapped, “Dis- 
gusting! An Earth woman 
and a Bluie! If you were on 
Mars, lady, we’d deport you 
so fast your tail would burn. 
And God help the Bluie!” 
Sylvie blew a cloud of 
smoke at Spurling. “You’re 
not on Mars, Jack. You’re 
back in civilization where we 
do what we damned well 
please.” 

Spurling laughed. “I’ve 
heard about you Century- 
Plussers. You’re all sick.” 
“You can’t claim any mo- 
nopoly on mental health. Not 
with that concentration camp 
you run on Mars. Coming, 
Gavir?” 

Gavir grinned at Spurling. 
“The contract, I believe, does 
not cover my private life.” 
Hoppy Davery said, “Syl- 
vie, I don’t think this is wise.” 
Sylvie uttered a short, 
sharp obscenity, linked arms 
with Gavir, and strolled out. 

“You screwball Senile De- 
linquent,” Spurling yelled aft- 
er Sylvie, “you oughtta be 
locked up!” 

L UCIFER Grotto was in 
that same quarter in 
which Gavir had been attack- 
ed. Sylvie told him it was the 
hangout for wealthier New 
York Century-Plussers. Gavir 
told her about the attack, and 
she laughed. “It won’t happen 



again. You’re a hero to the 
Senile Delinquents now. By 
the way, the big fellow with 
the broad-brimmed hat, he’s 
one of the most prominent 
Senile Delinquents of our day. 
He’s president of the biggest 
privately-owned space line, 
but he likes to call himself the 
Hat Rat. You must be one of 
the few people who ever got 
away from him alive.” 

“He seemed happy to get 
away from me,” said Gavir. 

An arrangement of force- 
planes and 3V projections 
made the front of Lucifer 
Grotto appear to be a curtain 
of flames. Gavir hung back, 
but Sylvie inserted a tiny gold 
pitchfork into a small aper- 
ture in the glowing, rippling 
surface. The flames swept 
aside, revealing a doorway. A 
bearded man in black tights 
escorted them through a lur- 
idly-lit bar to a private room. 
When they were alone, Sylvie 
dropped her cape to the floor, 
sat on the edge of a huge, pink 
divan, and smiled at Gavir. 

Gavir contemplated her. 
That she was over a hundred 
years old was a little fright- 
ening. But the skin of her face 
and her bare upper body was 
a warm color, and tautly fill- 
ed. She had lashed out at 
Spurling, and he liked her for 
that. But in one way she was 
like Spurling. She didn’t fit 
into the bland, non-violent 
world of Malcomb and Hoppy. 

He shook his head. He said, 
“Sylvie, why — well, why are 

103 



STAR PERFORMER 




you the way you are? Why — 
and how — have you broken 
away from Ethical Condition- 
ing?” 

Sylvie frowned. She spoke 
a few words into the air, or- 
dering drinks. She said, “I 
didn’t do it deliberately. When 
I reached the age of about a 
hundred it stopped working 
for me. I suddenly wanted to 
do what / wanted to do. And 
then I found out that I didn’t 
know what I wanted to do. It 
was Ethical Conditioning or 
nothing, so I picked nothing. 
And here I am, chasing noth- 
ing.” 

“How do you chase noth- 
ing?” 

She set fire to a white tube. 
“This, for instance. They used 
to do it before they found out 
it caused cancer. Now there’s 
no more cancer, but even if 
there were, I’d still smoke. 
That’s the attitude I have. You 
try things. You live in the 
past, if you’re inclined, adopt 
the costumes and manners of 
some more colorful time. You 
try ridiculous things, disgust- 
ing things, vicious things. 
You know they’re all nothing, 
but you have to do something, 
so you go on doing nothing, 
elaborately and violently.” 

A tray of drinks rose 
through the floor. Sylvie 
frowned as she noticed a fold- 
ed paper tucked between the 
glasses. She picked it up and 
read it, chuckled, and read it 
again, aloud. 

“Sir: I beg you to forgive 



the presumption of my recent 
attack on you. Since then you 
have captured my imagina- 
tion. I now hold you to be the 
noblest savage of them all. 
Henceforward please consider 
me, Your obedient servant, 
Hat Rat.” 

“You’ve impressed him,” 
said Sylvie. “But you impress 
me even more. Come here.” 
She held out slim arms to 
him. He had no wish to refuse 
her. She was not like a Mar- 
tian woman, but he found the 
differences exciting and at- 
tractive. He went to her, and 
he forgot entirely that she was 
over a hundred years old. 

I N THE months that follow- 
ed, Gavir’s fame spread 
over Earth. By spring, the 
rating computers credited him 
with an audience of eight 
hundred million — ninety-five 
percent of whom were Cen- 
tury-Plussers. Davery doubled 
Gavir’s salary. 

Gavir toured the world with 
Sylvie, mobbed everywhere by 
worshipful Century-Plussers. 
Male Century-Plussers by the 
millions adopted blue doublets 
and blue kilts in honor of their 
hero. 

Blue-dyed hair was now 
de rigeur among the ladies of 
Lucifer Grotto. The Hat Rat 
himself, who often appeared 
at a respectful distance in 
crowds around Gavir, now 
wore a wide-brimmed hat of 
brightest blue. 

Then there came the dream- 

ROBERT J. SHEA 



104 




cast on which Gavir sang the 
Song of Complaint . 

It was an ancient song, a 
Desert Man’s outcry against 
injustice, enemies, false 
friends and callous leaders. It 
was a protest against suffer- 
ings that could neither be 
borne nor prevented. At the 
climax of the song Gavir pic- 
tured a tribal chief who re- 
fused to make fair division 
of the spoils of a hunt with 
his warriors. Gradually he al- 
lowed this image to turn into 
a picture of Hoppy Davery 
withholding bundles of money 
from a starving Gavir. Then 
he ended the song. 

Hoppy sent for him next 
morning. 

“Why did you do that?” he 
said. “Listen to this.” 

A recorded voice boomed: 
“This is Hat Rat. Pay the 
Blue Boy what he deserves, or 
I will give you death. It will 
be a personal thing between 
you and me. I will besprinkle 
you with corrosive acids; I 
will burn out your eyes; I 
will — ” 

Hoppy cut the voice off. Ga- 
vir saw that he was sweating. 
“There were dozens like that. 
If you want more money, I’ll 
give you more money. Say 
something nice about me on 
your next dreamcast, for 
heaven’s sake!” 

Gavir spread his big blue 
hands. “I am sorry. I don’t 
want more money. I cannot al- 
ways control the pictures I 
make. These images come into 

STAR PERFORMER 



my mind even though they 
have nothing to do with me.” 
Hoppy shook his head. 
“That’s because you haven’t 
had Ethical Conditioning. We 
don’t have this trouble with 
our other performers. You 
just must remember that 
dreamvision is the most po- 
tent communications medium 
ever devised. Be careful.” 

“I will,” said Gavir. 

O N HIS next dreamcast Ga- 
vir sang the Song of the 
Blood Feud. He pictured a 
Desert Man whose father had 
been killed by a drock. 

The Desert Man ran over 
the red sand, and he found the 
drock. He did not throw his 
knife. That would not have 
satisfied his hatred. He fell 
upon the drock and stabbed 
and stabbed. 

The Desert Man howled his 
hunting-cry over the body of 
his enemy, and spat into its 
face. 

And the fanged face of the 
drock turned into the square, 
battered face of Jarvis Spurl- 
ing. Gavir held the image in 
his mind for a long moment. 

When the dreamcast was 
over, a studio page ran up to 
Gavir. “Mr. Spurling wants to 
see you at once, at his office.” 
“Let him come and find 
me,” said Gavir. “Let us go, 
Sylvie.” 

They went to Lucifer Grot- 
to where Gavir’s wealthiest 
admirers among the Senile 
Delinquents were giving a 



105 




party for him in the Pande- 
iponium Room. The only 
prominent person missing, as 
Sylvie remarked after survey- 
ing the crowd, was the Hat 
Rat. They wondered about it, 
but no one knew where he 
was. 

Sheets of flame illuminated 
the wild features and strange 
garments of over a hundred 
Century-Plus ladies and gen- 
tlemen. Gouts of flame leaped 
from the walls to light an- 
tique-style cigarettes. Drinks 
were refilled from nozzles of 
molded fire. 

An hour passed from the 
time of Gavir’s arrival. 

Then Jarvis Spurling join- 
ed the party. There was a 
heavy frontier sonic pistol 
strapped at his waist. A pro- 
testing Malcomb was behind 
him. 

Jarvis Spurling’s square 
face was dark with anger. 
“You deliberately put my face 
on that animal! You want to 
make the public hate me. I pay 
your salary and keep you here 
on Earth, and this is what I 
get for it. All right. A Bluie 
is a Bluie, and I’ll treat you 
like a Bluie should be treat- 
ed.” He unsnapped his holster 
and drew the square, heavy 
pistol out and pointed it at 
Gavir. 

Gavir stood up. His right 
hand plucked at his doublet. 

“You’re itching to go for 
that throwing knife,” said 
Spurling. “Go on ! Take it out 
and get ready to throw it. I’ll 



give you that much chance. 
Let’s make a game out of this. 
We’ll make like we’re back on 
Mars, Bluie, and you’re out 
hunting a drock. And you find 
one, only this drock has a gun. 
How about that, Bluie?” 

Gavir took out the narvoon, 
grasped the blade, and drew 
his arm back. 

“Gavir!” 

It was the Hat Rat. He 
stood between pillars of flame 
in the doorway of the Pande- 
monium Room of Lucifer 
Grotto, and there was a pecul- 
iar contrivance of dark brown 
wood and black metal tubing 
cradled in his arm. “This an- 
cient shotgun I dedicate to 
your blood feud. I shall hunt 
down your enemy, Gavir!” 

Spurling turned. The Hat 
Rat saw him. 

“The enemy!” the Hat Rat 
shouted. 

The shotgun exploded. 

Spurling’s body was thrown 
back against Gavir. Gavir saw 
a huge ragged red caved-in 
place in Spurling’s chest. 
Spurling’s body sagged to the 
floor and lay there face up, 
eyes open. The Senile Delin- 
quents of Lucifer Grotto lean- 
ed forward to grin at the tat- 
tered body. 

Still holding the narvoon, 
Gavir stood over his dead ene- 
my. He threw back his head 
and howled out the hunting 
cry of the Desert Men. Then 
he looked down and spat in 
Jarvis Spurling’s dead face.

THE 

SIX 

FINGERS 

TIME 




Time is money. 

Time heals all wounds. 
Given time , 
anything is possible. 
And now he had all the 
time in the world ! 



By R. A. LAFFERTY 




Illustrated by GAUGHAN 

H E BEGAN by breaking 
things that morning. He 
broke the glass of water on 
his night stand. He knocked 
it crazily against the opposite 
wall and shattered it. Yet it 
shattered slowly. This would 
have surprised him if he had 
been fully awake, for he had 
only reached out sleepily for 
it. 

Nor had he wakened regu- 
larly to his alarm; he had 
wakened to a weird, slow, low 
booming, yet the clock said 
six, time for the alarm. And 
the low boom, when it came 
again, seemed to come from 
the clock. 

He reached out and touched 
it gently, but it floated off the 
stand at his touch and bounced 
around slowly on the floor. 
And when he picked it up 
again it had stopped, nor 
would shaking start it. 



109 




He checked the electric 
clock in the kitchen. This also 
said six o’clock, but the sweep 
hand did not move. In his 
living room the radio clock 
said six, but the second hand 
seemed stationary. 

“But the lights in both 
rooms work,” said Vincent. 
“How are the clocks stopped ? 
Are they on a separate cir- 
cuit?” 

He went back to his bed- 
room and got his wristwatch. 
It also said six ; and its sweep 
hand did not sweep. 

“Now this could get silly. 
What is it that would stop 
both mechanical and electrical 
clocks ?” 

He went to the window and 
looked out at the clock on the 
Mutual Insurance Building. It 
said six o’clock, and the sec- 
ond hand did not move. 

“Well, it is possible that the 
confusion is not limited to my- 
self. I once heard the fanciful 
theory that a cold shower will 
clear the mind. For me it 
never has, but I will try it. I 
can always use cleanliness 
for an excuse.” 

The shower didn’t work. 
Yes, it did: the water came 
now, but not like water ; like 
very slow syrup that hung in 
the air. He reached up to 
touch it there hanging down 
and stretching. And it shat- 
tered like glass when he 
touched it and drifted in fan- 
tastic slow globs across the 
room. But it had the feel of 
water, wet and pleasantly 

no 



cool. And in a quarter of a 
minute or so it was down over 
his shoulders and back, and he 
luxuriated in it. He let it soak 
his head and it cleared his 
wits at once. 

“There is not a thing wrong 
with me. I am fine. It is not 
my fault that the water is 
slow this morning and other 
things awry.” 

He reached for the towel 
and it tore to pieces in his 
hands like porous wet paper. 

N OW he became very care- 
ful in the way he handled 
things. Slowly, tenderly, and 
deftly he took them so that 
they would not break. He 
shaved himself without mis- 
hap in spite of the slow water 
in the lavatory also. 

Then he dressed himself 
with the greatest caution and 
cunning, breaking nothing ex- 
cept his shoe laces, a thing 
that is likely to happen at any 
time. 

“If there is nothing the 
matter with me, then I will 
check and see if there is any- 
thing seriously wrong with 
the world. The dawn was fair- 
ly along when I looked out, as 
it should have been. Approxi- 
mately twenty minutes have 
passed ; it is a clear morning ; 
the sun should now have hit 
the top several stories of the 
Insurance Building.” 

But it had not. It was a 
clear morning, but the dawn 
had not brightened at all in 
the twenty minutes. And that 

R. A. LAFFERTY 




big clock still said six. It had 
not changed. 

Yet it had changed, and he 
knew it with a queer feeling. 
He pictured it as it had been 
before. The hour and the min- 
ute hand had not moved no- 
ticeably. But the second hand 
had moved. It had moved a 
third of the dial. 

So he pulled up a chair to 
the window and watched it. 
He realized that, though he 
could not see it move, yet it 
did make progress. He watch- 
ed it for perhaps five minutes. 
It moved through a space of 
perhaps five seconds. 

“Well, that is not my prob- 
lem. It is that of the clock 
maker, either a terrestrial or 
a celestial one.” 

But he left his rooms with- 
out a good breakfast and he 
left them very early. How did 
hp know that it was early 
since there was something 
wrong with the time? Well, it 
was early at least according 
to the sun and according to 
the clocks, neither of which 
institutions seemed to be 
working properly. 

He left without a good 
breakfast because the coffee 
would not make and the bacon 
would not fry. And in plain 
point of fact the fire would 
not heat. The gas flame came 
from the pilot light like a 
slowly spreading stream or an 
unfolding flower. Then it 
burned far too steadily. The 
skillet remained cold when 
placed over it ; nor would wa- 

THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



ter even heat. It had taken at 
least five minutes to get the 
water out of the faucet in the 
first place. 

He ate a few pieces of left- 
over bread and some scraps of 
meat. 

In the street there was no 
motion, no real motion. A 
truck, first seeming at rest, 
moved very slowly. There was 
no gear in which it could move 
so slowly. And there was a 
taxi which crept along, but 
Charles Vincent had to look 
at it carefully for some time 
to be sure that it was in mo- 
tion. Then he received a shock. 
He realized by the early morn- 
ing light that the driver of it 
was dead. Dead with his eyes 
wide open! 

Slowly as it was going, and 
by whatever means it was 
moving, it should really be 
stopped. He walked over to it, 
opened the door, and pulled 
on the brake. Then he looked 
into the eyes of the dead man. 
Was he really dead? It was 
hard to be sure. He felt warm. 
But, even as Vincent looked, 
the eyes of the dead man had 
begun to close. And close they 
did and open again in a mat- 
ter of about twenty seconds. 

T HIS was weird. The slowly 
closing and opening eyes 
sent a chill through Vincent. 
And the dead man had begun 
to lean forward in his seat. 
Vincent put a hand in the 
middle of the man’s chest to 
hold him upright, but he 

111 




found the forward pressure 
as relentless as it was slow. 
He was unable to keep the 
dead man up. 

So he let him go, watching 
curiously; and in a few sec- 
onds the driver’s face was 
against the wheel. But it was 
almost as if it had no inten- 
tion of stopping there. It 
pressed into the wheel with 
dogged force. He would surely 
break his face. Vincent took 
several holds on the dead man 
and counteracted the pressure 
somewhat. Yet the face was 
being damaged, and if things 
were normal, blood would 
have flowed. 

The man had been dead so 
long however, that (though he 
was still warm) his blood 
must have congealed, for it 
was fully two minutes before 
it began to ooze. 

“Whatever I have done, I 
have done enough damage,” 
said Vincent. “And, in what- 
ever nightmare I am in, I am 
likely to do further harm if I 
meddle more. I had better 
leave it alone.” 

He walked on down the 
morning street. Yet whatever 
vehicles he saw were moving 
with an incredible slowness, 
as though driven by some fan- 
tastic gear reduction. And 
there were people here and 
there frozen solid. It was a 
chilly morning, but it was not 
that cold. They were immobile 
in positions of motion, as 
though they were playing the 
children’s game of Statues. 



“How is it,” said Charles 
Vincent, “that this young girl 
(who I believe works across 
the street from us) should 
have died standing up and in 
full stride? But, no. She is 
not dead. Or, if so, she died 
with a very alert expression. 
And — oh, my God, she’s doing 
it too !” 

For he realized that the 
eyes of the girl were closing, 
and in the space of no more 
than a quarter of a second 
they had completed their cycle 
and were open again. Also, 
and this was even stranger, 
she had moved, moved for- 
ward in full stride. He would 
have timed her if he could, 
but how could he when all the 
clocks were crazy? Yet she 
must have been taking about 
two steps a minute. 

He went into the cafeteria. 
The early morning crowd that 
he had often watched through 
the windows was there. The 
girl who made flapjacks in the 
window had just flipped one 
and it hung in the air. Then it 
floated over as if caught by 
a slight breeze, and sank 
slowly down as if settling in 
water. 

The breakfasters, like the 
people in the street, were all 
dead in this new way, moving 
with almost imperceptible mo- 
tion. And all had apparently 
died in the act of drinking 
coffee, eating eggs, or munch- 
ing toast. And if there were 
only time enough, there was 
even a chance that they would 



112 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




get the drinking, eating, and 
munching done with, for there 
was the shadow of movement 
in them all. 

The cashier had the register 
drawer open and money in her 
hand, and the hand of the cus- 
tomer was outstretched for it. 
In time, somewhere in the new 
leisurely time, the hands 
would come together and the 
change be given. And so it 
happened. It may have been 
a minute and a half, or two 
minutes, or two and a half. It 
is always hard to judge time, 
and now it had become all but 
impossible. 

“I am still hungry,” said 
Charles Vincent, “but it would 
be foolhardy to wait for serv- 
ice here. Should I help myself? 
They will not mind if they are 
dead. And if they are not dead, 
in any case it seems that I am 
invisible to them.” 

H E WOLFED several rolls. 

He opened a bottle of 
milk and held it upside down 
over his glass while he ate an- 
other roll. Liquids had all be- 
come perversely slow. 

But he felt better for his 
erratic breakfast. He would 
have paid for it, but how? 

He left the cafeteria and 
walked about the town as it 
seemed still to be quite early, 
though one could depend on 
neither sun nor clock for the 
time any more. The traffic 
lights were unchanging. He 
sat for a long time in a little 
park and watched the town 

THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



and the big clock in the Com- 
merce Building tower ; but like 
all the clocks it was either 
stopped or the hand would 
creep too slowly to be seen. 

It must have been just about 
an hour till the traffic lights 
changed, but change they did 
at last. By picking a point on 
the building across the street 
and watching what moved 
past it, he found that the 
traffic did indeed move. In a 
minute or so, the entire length 
of a car would pass the given 
point. 

He had, he recalled, been 
very far behind in his work 
and it had been worrying him. 
He decided to go to the office, 
early as it was or seemed to be. 

He let himself in. Nobody 
else was there. He resolved not 
to look at the clock and to be 
very careful of the way he 
handled all objects because of 
his new propensity for break- 
ing things. This considered, all 
seemed normal there. He had 
said the day before that he 
could hardly catch up on his 
work if he put in two days 
solid. He now resolved at least 
to work steadily until some- 
thing happened, whatever it 
was. 

For hour after hour he 
worked on his tabulations and 
reports. Nobody else had ar- 
rived. Could something be 
wrong? Certainly something 
was wrong. But this was not 
a holiday. That was not it. 

Just how long can a stub- 
born and mystified man plug 



113 




away at his task? It was hour 
after hour after hour. He did 
not become hungry nor partic- 
ularly tired. And he did get 
through a lot of work. 

“It must be half done. How- 
ever it has happened, I have 
caught up on at least a day's 
work. I will keep on.” 

He must have continued si- 
lently for another eight or ten 
hours. 

He was caught up com- 
pletely on his back work. 

“Well, to some extent I can 
work into the future. I can 
head up and carry over. I can 
put in everything but the fig- 
ures of the field reports.” 

And he did so. 

“It will be hard to bury me 
in work again. I could almost 
coast for a day. I don’t even 
know what day it is, but I 
must have worked twenty 
hours straight through and 
nobody has arrived. Perhaps 
nobody ever will arrive. If 
they are moving with the 
speed of the people in the 
nightmare outside, it is no 
wonder they have not ar- 
rived.” 

He put his head down on his 
arms on the desk. The last 
thing he saw before he closed 
his eyes was the misshapen 
left thumb that he had always 
tried to conceal a little by the 
way he handled his hands. 

“At least I know that I am 
still myself. I’d know myself 
anywhere by that.” 

Then he went to sleep at his 
desk. 



J ENNY came in with a 
quick click-click-click of 
high heels, and he wakened to 
the noise. 

“What are you doing dozing 
at your desk, Mr. Vincent? 
Have you been here all night?” 
“I don’t know, Jenny. Hon- 
estly I don’t.” 

“I was only teasing. Some- 
times when I get here a little 
early I take a catnap myself.” 
The clock said six minutes 
till eight and the second hand 
was sweeping normally. Time 
had returned to the world. Or 
to him. But had all that early 
morning of his been a dream? 
Then it had been a very effi- 
cient dream. He had accom- 
plished work that he could 
hardly have done in two days. 
And it was the same day that 
it was supposed to be. 

He went to the water foun- 
tain. The water now behaved 
normally. He went to the win- 
dow. The traffic was behaving 
as it should. Though some- 
times slow and sometimes 
snarled, yet it was in the pace 
of the regular world. 

The other workers arrived. 
They were not balls of fire, 
but neither was it necessary 
to observe them for several 
minutes to be sure they 
weren’t dead. 

“It did have its advan- 
tages,” Charles Vincent said. 
“I would be afraid to live with 
it permanently, but it would 
be handy to go into for a few 
minutes a day and accomplish 
the business of hours. I may 



114 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




be a case for the doctor. But 
just how would I go about tell- 
ing a doctor what was bother- 
ing me?” 

Now it had surely been less 
than two hours from his first 
rising till the time that he 
wakened to the noise of Jenny 
from his second sleep. And 
how long that second sleep had 
been, or in which time enclave, 
he had no idea. But how ac- 
count for it all? He had spent 
a long while in his own rooms, 
much longer than ordinary in 
his confusion. He had walked 
the city mile after mile in his 
puzzlement. And he had sat in 
the little park for hours and 
studied the situation. And he 
had worked at his own desk 
for an outlandish long time. 

Well, he would go to the 
doctor. A man is obliged to 
refrain from making a fool of 
himself to the world at large, 
but to his own lawyer, his 
priest, or his doctor he will 
sometimes have to come as a 
fool. By their callings they are 
restrained from scoffing open- 
ly- 

Dr. Mason was not particu- 
larly a friend. Charles Vincent 
realized with some unease that 
he did not have any particu- 
lar friends, only acquaint- 
ances and associates. It was 
as though he were of a species 
slightly apart from his fel- 
lows. He wished now a little 
that he had a particular 
friend. 

But Dr. Mason was an ac- 
quaintance of some years, had 

THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



the reputation of being a good 
doctor, and besides Vincent 
had now arrived at his office 
and been shown in. He would 
either have to — well, that was 
as good a beginning as any. 

“Doctor, I am in a predica- 
ment. I will either have to in- 
vent some symptoms to 
account for my visit here, or 
make an excuse and bolt, or 
tell you what is bothering me, 
even though you will think I 
am a new sort of idiot.” 
“Vincent, every day people 
invent symptoms to cover 
their visits here, and I know 
that they have lost their nerve 
about the real reason for com- 
ing. And every day people do 
make excuses and bolt. But ex- 
perience tells me that I will 
get a larger fee if you tackle 
the third alternative. And, 
Vincent, there is no new sort 
of idiot.” 

V INCENT said, “It may not 
sound so silly if I tell it 
quickly. I awoke this morning 
to some very puzzling inci- 
dents. It seemed that time it- 
self had stopped, or that the 
whole world had gone into 
super-slow motion. The water 
would neither flow nor boil, 
and fire would not heat food. 
The clocks, which I first be- 
lieved had stopped, crept 
along at perhaps a minute an 
hour. The people I met in the 
streets appeared dead, frozen 
in lifelike attitudes. And it 
was only by watching them 
for a very long time that I 

115 




perceived that they did indeed 
have motion. One car I saw 
creeping slower than the most 
backward snail, and a dead 
man at the wheel of it. I went 
to it, opened the door, and put 
on the brake. I realized after 
a time that the man was not 
dead. But he bent forward 
and broke his face on the 
steering wheel. It must have 
taken a full minute for his 
head to travel no more than 
ten inches, yet I was unable 
to prevent his hitting the 
wheel. I then did other bizarre 
things in a world that had 
died on its feet. I walked many 
miles through the city, and 
then I sat for hours in the 
park. I went to the office and 
let myself in. I accomplished 
work that must have taken me 
twenty hours. I then took a 
nap at my desk. When I awoke 
on the arrival of the others, it 
was six minutes to eight in the 
morning of the same day, to- 
day. Not two hours had passed 
from my rising, and time was 
back to normal. But the things 
that happened in that time 
that could never be compress- 
ed into two hours.” 

“One question first, Vincent. 
Did you actually accomplish 
the work of many hours?” 

“I did. It was done, and 
done in that time. It did not 
become undone on the return 
of time to normal.” 

“A second question. Had 
you been worried about your 
work, about being behind ?” 
“Yes. Emphatically.” 



“Then here is one explana- 
tion. You retired last night. 
But very shortly afterward 
you arose in a state of som- 
nambulism. There are facets 
of sleepwalking which we do 
not at all understand. The 
time-out-of-focus interludes 
were parts of a walking dream 
of yours. You dressed and 
went to your office and worked 
all night. It is possible to do 
routine tasks in a somnam- 
bulistic state rapidly and even 
feverishly, with an intense 
concentration — to perform 
prodigies. You may have fall- 
en into a normal sleep there 
when you had finished, or you 
may have been awakened di- 
rectly from your somnambul- 
istic trance on the arrival of 
your co-workers. There, that 
is a plausible and workable 
explanation. In the case of an 
apparently bizarre happening, 
it is always well to have a 
rational explanation to fall 
back on. They will usually sat- 
isfy a patient and put his 
mind at rest. But often they 
do not satisfy me.” 

“Your explanation very 
nearly satisfies me, Dr. Mason, 
and it does put my mind con- 
siderably at rest. I am sure 
that in a short while I will be 
able to accept it completely. 
But why does it not satisfy 
you?” 

“One reason is a man I 
treated early this morning. He 
had his face smashed, and he 
had seen — or almost seen — a 
ghost: a ghost of incredible 



116 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




swiftness that was more 
sensed than seen. The ghost 
opened the door of his car 
while it was going at full 
speed, jerked on the brake, 
and caused him to crack his 
head. This man was dazed and 
had a slight concussion. I have 
convinced him that he did not 
see any ghost at all, that he 
must have dozed at the wheel 
and run into something. As I 
say, I am harder to convince 
than my patients. But it may 
have been coincidence.” 

"I hope so. But you also 
seem to have another reserva- 
tion.” 

“After quite a few years in 
practice, I seldom see or hear 
anything new. Twice before 
I have been told a happening 
or a dream on the line of what 
you experienced.” 

“Did you convince your pa- 
tients that it was only a 
dream ?” 

“I did. Both of them. That 
is, I convinced them the first 
few times it happened to 
them.” 

“Were they satisfied?” 

“At first. Later, not entire- 
ly. But they both died within 
a year of their first coming 
to me.” 

“Nothing violent, I hope.” 

“Both had the gentlest, 
deaths. That of senility ex- 
treme.” 

“Oh. Well, I’m too young for 
that.” 

“I would like you to come 
back in a month or so.” 

“I will, if the delusion or the 

THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



dream returns. Or if I do not 
feel well.” 

After this Charles Vincent 
began to forget about the in- 
cident. He only recalled it with 
humor sometimes when again 
he was behind in his work. 

“Well, if it gets bad enougli 
I may do another sleepwalk- 
ing act and catch up. But if 
there is another aspect of time 
and I could enter it at will, it 
might often be handy.” 

C HARLES VINCENT never 
saw his face at all. It is 
very dark in some of those 
clubs and the Coq Bleu is like 
the inside of a tomb. He went 
to the clubs only about once a 
month, sometimes after a 
show when he did not want to 
go home to bed, sometimes 
when he was just plain rest- 
less. 

Citizens of the more fortu- 
nate states may not know of 
the mysteries of the clubs. In 
Vincent’s the only bars are 
beer bars, and only in the 
clubs can a person get a drink, 
and only members are admit- 
ted. It is true that even such 
a small club as the Coq Bleu 
had thirty thousand members, 
and at a dollar a year that is 
a nice sideline. The little num- 
bered membership cards cost 
a penny each for the printing, 
and the member wrote in his 
own name. But he had to have 
a card — or a dollar for a card 
— to gain admittance. 

But there could be no enter- 
tainments in the clubs. There 



117 




was nothing there but the 
little bar room in the near 
darkness. 

The man was there, and 
then he was not, and then he 
was there again. And always 
where he sat it was too dark 
to see his face. 

“I wonder,” he said to Vin- 
cent (or to the bar at large, 
though there were no other 
customers and the bartender 
was asleep), “I wonder if you 
have ever read Zurbarin on 
the Relationship of Extradigi- 
talism to Genius?" 

“I have never heard of the 
work nor of the man,” said 
Vincent. “I doubt if either 
exists.” 

“I am Zunoarin,” said the 
man. 

Vincent hid his misshapen 
left thumb. Yet it could not 
have been noticed in that 
light, and he must have been 
crazy to believe there was any 
connection between it and the 
man’s remark. It was not truly 
a double thumb. He was not 
an extradigital, nor was he a 
genius. 

“I refuse to become inter- 
ested in you,” said Vincent. 
“I am on the verge of leaving. 
I dislike waking the bartend- 
er, but I did want another 
drink.” 

“Sooner done than said,” 

“What is?” 

“Your glass is full.” 

“It is? So it is. Is it a 
trick?” 

“Trick is the name for any- 
thing either too frivolous or 

118 



too mystifying for us to com- 
prehend. But on one long early 
morning of a month ago, you 
also could have done the 
trick, and nearly as well.” 
“Could I have? How would 
you know about my long early 
morning — assuming there to 
have been such?” 

“I watched you for a while. 
Few others have the equip- 
ment to watch you with when 
you’re in the aspect.” 

S O THEY were silent for 
some time, and Vincent 
watched the clock and was 
ready to go. 

“I wonder,” said the man in 
the dark, “if you have read 
Schimmelpenninck on the Sex- 
agintal and the Duodecimal in 
the Chaldee Mysteries?” 

“I have not and I doubt if 
anyone else has. I would guess 
that you are also Schimmel- 
penninck and that you have 
just made up the name on the 
spur of the moment.” 

“I am Schimm, it is true, 
but I made up the name on the 
spur of a moment many years 
ago.” 

“I am a little bored with 
you,” said Vincent, “but I 
would appreciate it if you’d 
do your glass-filling trick once 
more.” 

“I have just done so. And 
you are not bored; you are 
frightened.” 

“Of what?” asked Vincent, 
whose glass was in fact full 
again. 

“Of reentering a dread that 
R. A. LAFFERTY 




you are not sure was a dream. 
But there are advantages to 
being both invisible and inau- 
dible.” 

“Can you be invisible?” 
“Was I not when I went be- 
hind the bar just now and 
fixed you a drink?” 

“How?” 

“A man in full stride goes 
at the rate of about five miles 
an hour. Multiply that by 
sixty, which is the number of 
time. When I leave my stool 
and go behind the bar, I go 
and return at the rate of three 
hundred miles an hour. So I 
am invisible to you, particu- 
larly if I move while you 
blink.” 

“One thing does not match. 
You might have got around 
there and back, but you could 
not have poured.” 

“Shall I say that mastery 
over liquids is not given to 
beginners? But for us there 
are many ways to outwit the 
slowness of matter.” 

“I believe that you are a 
hoaxer. Do you know Dr. 
Mason ?” 

“I know that you went to 
see him. I know of his futile 
attempts to penetrate a cer- 
tain mystery. But I have not 
talked to him of you.” 

“I still believe that you are 
a phony. Could you put me 
back into the state of my 
dream of a month ago?” 

“It was not a dream. But I 
could put you again into that 
state.” 

“Prove it.” 



“Watch the clock. Do you 
believe that I can point my 
finger at it and stop it for 
you ? It is already stopped for 
me.” 

“No, I don’t believe it. Yes, 
I guess I have to, since I see 
that you have just done it. But 
it may be another trick. I don’t 
know where the clock is plug- 
ged in.” 

“Neither do I. Come to the 
door. Look at every clock you 
can see. Are they not all 
stopped?” 

“Yes. Maybe the power has 
gone off all over town.” 

“You know it has not. There 
are still lighted windows in 
those buildings, though it is 
quite late.” 

“Why are you playing with 
me? I am neither on the in- 
side nor the outside. Either 
tell me the secret or say that 
you will not tell me.” 

“The secret isn’t a simple 
one. It can only be arrived 
at after all philosophy and 
learning have been assimi- 
lated.” 

“One man cannot arrive at 
that in one lifetime.” 

“Not in an ordinary life- 
time. But the secret of the se- 
cret (if I may put it that way) 
is that one must use part of 
it as a tool in learning. You 
could not learn all in one life- 
time, but by being permitted 
the first step — to be able to 
read, say, sixty books in the 
time it took you to read one, 
to pause for a minute in 
thought and use up only one 



THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



119 




second, to get a day’s work 
accomplished in eight minutes 
and so have time for other 
things — by such ways one may 
make a beginning. I will warn 
you, though. Even for the most 
intelligent, it is a race.” 

“A race? What race?” 

“It is a race between suc- 
cess, which is life, and failure, 
which is death.” 

“Let’s skip the melodrama. 
How do I get into the state 
and out of it?” 

“Oh, that is simple, so easy 
that it seems like a gadget. 
Here are two diagrams I will 
draw. Note them carefully. 
This first, envision it in your 
mind and you are in the state. 
Now this second one, envision, 
and you are out of it.” 

“That easy?” 

“That deceptively easy. The 
trick is to learn why it works 
—if you want to succeed, 
meaning to live.” 

So Charles Vincent left him 
and went home, walking the 
mile in a little less than fif- 
teen normal seconds. But he 
still had not seen the face of 
the man. 

'T'HERE are advantages in- 
tellectual, monetary, and 
amorous in being able to enter 
the accelerated state at will. 
It is a fox game. One must be 
careful not to be caught at it, 
nor . to break or harm that 
which is in the normal state. 

Vincent could always find 
eight or ten minutes unob- 
served to accomplish the day’s 

120 



work. And a fifteen-minute 
coffee break could turn into a 
fifteen-hour romp around the 
town. 

There was this boyish 
pleasure in becoming a ghost : 
to appear and stand motion- 
less in front of an onrushing 
train and to cause the scream 
of the whistle, and to be in 
no danger, being able to move 
five or ten times as fast as the 
train ; to enter and to sit sud- 
denly in the middle of a select 
group and see them stare, and 
then disappear from the mid- 
dle of them; to interfere in 
sports and games, entering a 
prize ring and tripping, ham- 
pering, or slugging the un- 
liked fighter ; to blue-shot 
down the hockey ice, skating 
at fifteen hundred miles an 
hour and scoring dozens of 
goals at either end while the 
people only know that some- 
thing odd is happening. 

There was pleasure in being 
able to shatter windows by 
chanting little songs, for the 
voice (when in the state) will 
be to the world at sixty times 
its regular pitch, though nor- 
mal to oneself. And for this 
reason also he was inaudible 
to others. 

There was fun in petty 
thieving and tricks. He would 
take a wallet from a man’s 
pocket and be two blocks away 
when the victim turned at the 
feel. He would come back and 
stuff it into the man’s mouth 
as he bleated to a policeman. 

He would come into the 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




home of a lady writing a let- 
ter, snatch up the paper and 
write three lines and vanish 
before the scream got out of 
her throat. 

He would take food off 
forks, put baby turtles and 
live fish into bowls of soup 
between spoonfuls of the 
eater. 

He would lash the hands of 
handshakers tightly together 
with stout cord. He unzipper- 
ed persons of both sexes when 
they were at their most 
pompous. He changed cards 
from one player’s hand to an- 
other’s. He removed golf balls 
from tees during the back- 
swing and left notes written 
large “YOU MISSED ME” 
pinned to the ground with the 
tee. 

Or he shaved mustaches 
and heads. Returning repeat- 
edly to one woman he disliked, 
he gradually clipped her bald 
and finally gilded her pate. 

With tellers counting their 
money, he interfered outrage- 
ously and enriched himself. 
He snipped cigarettes in two 
with a scissors and blew out 
matches, so that one frus- 
trated man broke down and 
cried at his inability to get a 
light. 

He removed the weapons 
from the holsters of policemen 
and put cap pistols and water 
guns in their places. He un- 
dipped the leashes of dogs and 
substituted little toy dogs roll- 
ing on wheels. 

He put frogs in water 

THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



glasses and left lighted fire- 
crackers on bridge tables. 

He reset wrist watches on 
wrists, and played pranks in 
men’s rooms. 

“I was always a boy at 
heart,” said Charles Vincent. 

A LSO during those first few 
days of the controlled 
new state, he established him- 
self materially, acquiring 
wealth by devious ways, and 
opening bank accounts in va- 
rious cities under various 
names, against a time of pos- 
sible need. 

Nor did he ever feel any 
shame for the tricks he played 
on unaccelerated humanity. 
For the people, when he was 
in the state, were as statues 
to him, hardly living, barely 
moving, unseeing, unhearing. 
And it is no shame to show 
disrespect to such comical 
statues. 

And also, and again because 
he was a boy at heart, he had 
fun with the girls. 

“I am one mass of black and 
blue marks,” said Jenny one 
day. “My lips are sore and my 
front teeth feel loosened. I 
don’t know what in the world 
is the matter with me.” 

Yet he had not meant to 
bruise or harm her. He was 
rather fond of her and he re- 
solved to be much more care- 
ful. Yet it was fun, when he 
was in the state and invisible 
to her because of his speed, to 
kiss her here and there in out- 
of-the-way places. She made 

121 




a nice statue and it was good 
sport. And there were others. 

'"You look older,” said one 
of his co-workers one day. 
“ Are you taking care of your- 
self? Are you worried?” 

/‘I am not,” said Vincent. "I 
neVer felt better or happier in 
my life.” 

i But now there was time for 
so' many things — time, in fact, 
for everything. There was no 
reason why he could not mas- 
ter anything in the world, 
when he could take off for fif- 
teen minutes and gain fifteen 
hours. Vincent was a rapid 
but careful reader. He could 
now read from a hundred and 
twenty to two hundred books 
in an evening and night; and 
he slept in the accelerated 
state and could get a full 
night’s sleep in eight minutes. 

He first acquired a knowl- 
edge of languages. A quite ex- 
tensive reading knowledge of 
a language can be acquired in 
three hundred hours world 
time, or three hundred min- 
utes (five hours) accelerated 
time. And if one takes the 
tongues in order, from the 
most familiar to the most re- 
mote, there is no real diffi- 
culty. He acquired fifty for a 
starter, and could always add 
any other any evening that he 
found he had a need for it. 
And at the same time he began 
to assemble and consolidate 
knowledge. Of literature, 
properly speaking, there are 
no more than ten thousand 
books that are really worth 



reading and falling in love 
with. These were gone 
through with high pleasure, 
and two or three thousand of 
them were important enough 
to be reserved for future re- 
reading. 

History, however, is very 
uneven ; and it is necessary to 
read texts and sources that for 
form are not worth reading. 
And the same with philosophy. 
Mathematics and science, pure 
or physical, could not, of 
course, be covered with the 
same speed. Yet, with time 
available, all could be master- 
ed. There is no concept ever 
expressed by any human mind 
that cannot be comprehended 
by any other normal human 
mind if time is available and 
it is taken in the proper order 
and context and with the 
proper preparatory work. 

And often, and now more 
often, Vincent felt that he 
Was touching the fingers of the 
secret; and always, when he 
came near it, it had a little bit 
the smell of the pit. 

For he had pegged out all 
the main points of the history 
of man ; or rather most of the 
tenable, or at least possible, 
theories of the history of man. 
It was hard to hold the main 
line of it, that double road of 
rationality and revelation that 
should lead always to a fuller 
and fuller development (not 
the fetish of progress, that toy 
word used only by toy people) , 
to an unfolding and growth 
and perfectibility. 



122 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




But the main line was often 
obscure and all but obliter- 
ated, and traced through fog 
and miasma. He had accepted 
the Fall of Man and the Re- 
demption as the cardinal 
points of history. But he un- 
derstood now that neither 
happened only once, that both 
were of constant occurrence; 
that there was a hand reach- 
ing up from that old pit with 
its shadow over man. And he 
had come to picture that hand 
in his dreams (for his dreams 
were especially vivid when in 
the state) as a six-digited 
monster reaching out. He be- 
gan to realize that the thing 
he was caught in was danger- 
ous and deadly. 

Very dangerous. 

Very deadly. 

One of the weird books that 
he often returned to and which 
continually puzzled him was 
the Relationship of Extradi- 
gitalism to Genius, written by 
the man whose face he had 
never seen, in one of his 
manifestations. 

It promised more than it 
delivered, and it intimated 
more than it said. Its theory 
was tedious and tenuous, bol- 
stered with undigested moun- 
tains of doubtful data. It left 
him unconvinced that persons 
of genius (even if it could be 
agreed who or what they 
were) had often the oddity of 
extra fingers and toes, or the 
yestiges of them. And it puz- 
zled him what possible differ- 
ence it could make. 



Y ET there were hints here 
of a Corsican who com- 
monly kept a hand hidden, or 
an earlier and more bizarre 
commander who wore always 
a mailed glove, of another man 
with a glove between the two ; 
hints that the multiplex-adept, 
Leonardo himself, who some- 
times drew the hands of men 
and often those of monsters 
with six fingers, may himself 
have had the touch. There was 
a comment of Caesar, not con- 
clusive, to the same effect. It 
is known that Alexander had 
a minor peculiarity; it is not 
known what it was ; this man 
made it seem that this was it. 
And it was averred of Gregory 
and Augustine, of Benedict 
and Albert and Acquinas. Yet 
a man with a deformity 
could not enter the priesthood ; 
if they had it, it must have 
been in vestigial form. 

There were cases for Char- 
les Magnut and Mahmud, for 
Saladin the Horseman and for 
Akhnaton the King ; for 
Homer (a Seleuciad-Greek 
statuette shows him with six 
fingers strumming an uniden- 
tified instrument while recit- 
ing) ; for Pythagoras, for 
Buonarroti, Santi, Theotoko- 
polous, van Rijn, Robusti. 

Zurbarin catalogued eight 
thousand names. He maintain- 
ed that they were geniuses. 
And that they were extradigi- 
tals. 

Charles Vincent grinned 
and looked down at his mis- 
shapen or double thumb. 



THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



123 




"At least I am in good 
though monotonous company. 
But what in the name of triple 
time is he driving at?” 

And it was not long after- 
ward that Vincent was exam- 
ining cuneiform tablets in the 
State Museum. These were a 
broken and not continuous 
series on the theory of num- 
bers, tolerably legible to the 
now encyclopedic Charles Vin- 
cent. And the series read in 
part: 

“On the divergence of the 
basis itself and the confusion 
caused — for it is five, or it is 
six, or ten or twelve, or sixty 
or a hundred, or three hun- 
dred and sixty or the double 
hundred, the thousand. The 
reason, not clearly understood 
by the people, is that Six and 
the Dozen are first, and Sixty 
is a compromise in conde- 
scending to the people. For the 
five, the ten are late, and are 
no older than the people them- 
selves. It is said, and credited, 
that people began to count by 
fives and tens from the num- 
ber of fingers on their hands. 
But before the people the — by 
the reason that they had— 
counted by sixes and twelves'. 
But Sixty is the number of 
time, divisible by both, for 
both must live together in 
time, though not on the same 
plane of time — ” Much of the 
rest was scattered. And it was 
while trying to set the hun- 
dreds of unordered clay tab- 
lets in proper sequence that 
Charles Vincent created the 



legend of the ghost in the mu- 
seum. 

For he spent his multi-hun- 
dred-hour nights there study- 
ing and classifying. Naturally 
he could not work without 
light, and naturally he could 
be seen when he sat still at his 
studies. But as the slow-mov- 
ing guards attemped to close 
in on him, he would move to 
avoid them, and his speed 
made him invisible to them. 
They were a nuisance and had 
to be discouraged. He bela- 
bored them soundly and they 
became less eager to try to 
capture him. 

His only fear was that they 
would some time try to shoot 
him to see if he were ghost or 
human. He could avoid a seen 
shot, which would come at no 
more than two and a half 
times his own greatest speed. 
But an unperceived shot could 
penetrate dangerously, even 
fatally, before he twisted 
away from it. 

He had fathered legends of 
other ghosts, that of the Cen- 
tral Library, that of Univer- 
sity Library, that of the John 
Charles Underwood Jr. Tech- 
nical Library. This plurality 
of ghosts tended to cancel out 
each other and bring believers 
into ridicule. Even those who 
had seen him as a ghost did 
not admit that they believed 
in the ghosts. 

H E WENT back to Dr. Ma- 
son for his monthly 
checkup. 



124 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




“You look terrible,” said the 
Doctor. “Whatever it is, you 
have changed. If you can af- 
ford it, you should take a long 
rest.” 

“I have the means,” said 
Charles Vincent, “and that is 
just what I will do. I’ll take a 
rest for a year or two.” 

He had begun to begrudge 
the time that he must spend at 
the world’s pace. From now on 
he was regarded as a recluse. 
He was silent and unsociable, 
for he found it a nuisance to 
come back to the common state 
to engage in conversation, and 
in his special state voices were 
too slow-pitched to intrude in- 
to his consciousnes. 

Except that of the man 
whose face he had never seen. 

“You are making very tardy 
progress,” said the man. Once 
more they were in a dark club. 
“Those who do not show more 
progress we cannot use. After 
all, you are only a vestigial. It 
is probable that you have very 
little of the ancient race in 
you. Fortunately those who do 
not show progress destroy 
themselves. You had not imag- 
ined that there were only two 
phases of time, had you ?” 
“Lately I have come to sus- 
pect that there are many 
more,” said Charles Vincent. 

“And you understand that 
only one step cannot succeed?” 
“I understand that the life 
I have been living is in direct 
violation of all that we know 
of the laws of mass, momen- 
tum, and acceleration, as well 

THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



as those of conservation of 
energy, the potential of the 
human person, the moral com- 
pensation, the golden mean, 
and the capacity of human or- 
gans. I know that I cannot 
multiply energy and experi- 
ence sixty times without a 
compensating increase of food 
intake, and yet I do it. I know 
that I cannot live on eight 
minutes’ sleep in twenty-four 
hours, but I do that also. I 
know that I cannot reasonably 
crowd four thousand years of 
experience into one lifetime, 
yet unreasonably I do not see 
what will prevent it But you 
say I will destroy myself.” 
“Those who take only the 
first step destroy themselves.” 
“And how does one take the 
second step?” 

“At the proper moment you 
will be given the choice.” 

“I have the most uncanny 
feeling that I will refuse the 
choice.” 

“From present indications, 
you will refuse it. You are fas- 
tidious.” 

“You have a smell about 
you, Old Man without a face. 
I know now what it is. It is 
the smell of the pit.” 

“Are you so slow to learn 
that?” 

“It is the mud from the pit, 
the same from which the clay 
tablets were formed, from the 
old land between the rivers. 
I’ve dreamed of the six- 
fingered hand reaching up 
from the pit and overshadow- 
ing us all. And I have read: 

125 




'The people first counted by 
fives and tens from the num- 
ber of fingers on their hands. 
But before the people the — 
for the reason that they had — 
counted by sixes and twelves.’ 
But time has left blanks in 
those tablets.” 

“Yes, time in one of its 
manifestations has deftly and 
with a purpose left those 
blanks.” 

“I cannot discover the name 
of the thing that goes in one 
of those blanks. Can you?” 

“I am part of the name that 
goes into one of those blanks.” 
“And you are the man with- 
out a face. But why is it that 
you overshadow and control 
people? And to what pur- 
pose?” 

“It will be long before you 
know those answers.” 

“When the choice comes to 
me, it will bear very careful 
weighing.” 

A FTER that a chill descend- 
ed on the life of Charles 
Vincent, for all that he still 
possessed his exceptional pow- 
ers. And he seldom now in- 
dulged in pranks. 

Except for Jennifer Parkey. 
It was unusual that he 
should be drawn to her. He 
knew her only slightly in the 
common world and she was at 
least fifteen years his senior. 
But now she appealed to him 
for her youthful qualities, and 
all his pranks with her were 
gentle ones. 

For one thing this spinster 

126 



did not frighten, nor did she 
begin locking her doors, never 
having bothered about such 
things before. He would come 
behind her and stroke her 
hair, and she would speak out 
calmly with that sort of quick- 
ening in her voice : “Who are 
you? Why won’t you let me 
see you? You are a friend, 
aren’t you ? Are you a man, or 
are you something else? If you 
can caress me, why can’t you 
talk to me? Please let me see 
you. I promise that I won’t 
hurt you.” 

It was as though she could 
not imagine that anything 
strange would hurt her. Or 
again when he hugged her or 
kissed her on the nape, she 
would call: “You must be a 
little boy, or very like a little 
boy, whoever you are. You are 
good not to break my things 
when you move about. Come 
here and let me hold you.” 

It is only very good people 
who have no fear at all of the 
unknown. 

When Vincent met Jennifer 
in the regular world, as he 
more often now found occa- 
sion to do, she looked at him 
appraisingly, as though she 
guessed some sort of connec- 
tion. 

She said one day: “I know 
it is an impolite thing to say, 
but you do not look well at all. 
Have you been to a doctor?” 

“Several times. But I think 
it is my doctor who should go 
to a doctor. He was always 
given to peculiar remarks, but 

R. A. LAFFERTY 




now he is becoming a little un- 
settled" 

“If I were your doctor, I 
believe I would also become a 
little unsettled. But you should 
find out what is wrong. You 
look terrible.” 

He did not look terrible. He 
had lost his hair, it is true, 
but many men lose their hair 
by thirty, though not perhaps 
as suddenly as he had. He 
thought of attributing it to the 
air resistance. After all, when 
he was in the state he did 
stride at some three hundred 
miles an hour. And enough of 
that is likely to blow the hair 
right off your head. And might 
that not also be the reason for 
his worsened complexion and 
the tireder look that appeared 
in his eyes? But he knew that 
this was nonsense. He felt no 
more air pressure when in his 
accelerated state than when in 
the normal one. 

He had received his sum- 
mons. He chose not to answer 
it. He did not want to be pre- 
sented with the choice ; he had 
no wish to be one with those 
of the pit. But he had no in- 
tention of giving up the great 
advantage which he now held 
over nature. 

“I will have it both ways,” 
he said. “I am already a con- 
tradiction and an impossibil- 
ity. The proverb was only the 
early statement of the law of 
moral compensation : ‘You 

can’t take more out of a bas- 
ket than it holds.’ But for a 
long time I have been in vio- 

THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



lation of the laws and bal- 
ances. ‘There is no road with- 
out a turning,' ‘Those who 
dance will have to pay the 
fiddler,’ ‘Everything that goes 
up comes down.’ But are pro- 
verbs really universal laws? 
Certainly. A sound proverb 
has the force of universal law ; 
it is but another statement of 
it. But I have contradicted 
the universal laws. It remains 
to be seen whether I have con- 
tradicted them with impunity. 
‘Every action has its reaction.’ 
If I refuse to deal with them, 
I will provoke a strong reac- 
tion. The man without a face 
said that it was always a race 
between full knowing and de- 
struction. Very well, I will 
race them for it.” 

T HEY began to persecute 
him then. He knew that 
they were in a state as accele- 
rated from his as his was from 
the normal. To them he was 
the almost motionless statue, 
hardly to be told from a dead 
man. To him they were by 
their speed both invisible and 
inaudible. They hurt him and 
haunted him. But still he 
would not answer the sum- 
mons. 

When the meeting took 
place, it was they who had to 
come to him, and they ma- 
terialized there in his room, 
men without faces. 

“The choice,” said one. 
“You force us to be so clumsy 
as to have to voice it.” 

“I will have no part of you. 

127 




You all smell of the pit, of that 
old mud of the cuneiforms of 
the land between the rivers, of 
the people who were before 
the people.” 

“It has endured a long time, 
and we consider it as enduring 
forever. But the Garden which 
was in the neighborhood — do 
you know how long the Gar- 
den lasted?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“That all happened in a 
single day, and before night- 
fall they were outside. You 
want to throw in with some- 
thing more permanent, don’t 
you.” 

“No. I don’t believe I do.” 
“What have you to lose?” 
“Only my hope of eternity.” 
“But you don’t believe in 
that. No man has ever really 
believed in eternity.” 

“No man has ever either 
entirely believed or disbelieved 
in it,” said Charles Vincent, 
“At least it cannot be 
proved,” said one of the face- 
less men. “Nothing is proved 
until it is over with. And in 
this case, if it is ever over 
with, then it is disproved. And 
all that time would one not be 
tempted to wonder, ‘What if, 
after all, it ends in the next 
minute?' ” 

“I imagine that if we sur- 
vive the flesh we will receive 
some sort of surety,” said 
Vincent. 

“But you are not sure either 
of such surviving or receiving. 
Now we have a very close ap- 
proximation of eternity. When 



time is multiplied by itself, 
and that repeated again and 
again, does that not approxi- 
mate eternity?” 

“I don’t believe it does. But 
I will not be of you. One of 
you has said that I am too fas- 
tidious. So now will you say 
that you’ll destroy me?” 

“No. We will only let you 
be destroyed. By yourself, 
you cannot win the race with 
destruction.” 

After that Charles Vincent 
somehow felt more mature. He 
knew he was not really meant 
to be a six-fingered thing of 
the pit. He knew that in some 
way he would have to pay for 
every minute and hour that he 
had gained. But what he had 
gained he would use to the 
fullest. And whatever could be 
accomplished by sheer acqui- 
sition of human knowledge, he 
would try to accomplish. 

And he now startled Dr. 
Mason by the medical knowl- 
edge he had picked up, the 
while the doctor amused him 
by the concern he showed for 
Vincent. For he felt fine. He 
was perhaps not as active as 
he had been, but that was only 
because he had become dubious 
of aimless activity. He was 
still the ghost of the libraries 
and museums, but was puz- 
zled that the published reports 
intimated that an old ghost 
had replaced a young one. 

H E NOW paid his mystic 
visits to Jennifer Parkey 
less often. For he was always 



128 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




dismayed to hear her exclaim 
to him m his ghostly form: 
“Your touch is so changed. 
You poor thing! Is there any- 
thing at all I can do to help 
you?” 

He decided that somehow 
she was too immature to un- 
derstand him, though he was 
still fond of her. He trans- 
ferred his affections to Mrs. 
Milly Maltby, a widow at 
least thiry years his senior. 
Yet here it was a sort of girl- 
ishness in her that appealed 
to him. She was a woman of 
sharp wit and real affection, 
and she also accepted his visi- 
tations without fear, following 
a little initial panic. 

They played games, writing 
games, for they communicated 
by writing. She would scribble 
a line, then hold the paper up 
in the air whence he would 
cause it to vanish into his 
sphere. He would return it in 
half a minute, or half a second 
by her time, with his retort. 
He had the advantage of her 
in time with greatly more op- 
portunity to think up respon- 
ses, but she had the advantage 
over him in natural wit and 
was hard to top. 

They also played checkers, 
and he often had to retire 
apart and read a chapter of 
a book on the art between 
moves, and even so she often 
beat him ; for native talent is 
likely to be a match for ac- 
cumulated lore and codified 
procedure. 

But to Milly also he was un- 
THE SIX FINGERS OF TIME 



faithful in his fashion, being 
now interested (he no longer 
became enamored or en- 
tranced) in a Mrs. Roberts, 
a great-grandmother who was 
his elder by at least fifty years. 
He had read all the data ex- 
tant on the attraction of the 
old for the young, but he still 
could not explain his succes- 
sive attachments. He decided 
that these three examples 
were enough to establish a 
universal law: that a woman 
is simply not afraid of a ghost, 
though he touches her and is 
invisible, and writes her notes 
without hands. It is possible 
that amorous spirits have 
known this for a long time, 
but Charles Vincent had made 
the discovery himself inde- 
pendently. 

When enough knowledge is 
accumulated on any subject, 
the pattern will sometimes 
emerge suddenly, like a form 
in a picture revealed where 
before it was not seen. And 
when enough knowledge is ac- 
cumulated on all subjects, is 
there not a chance that a pat- 
tern governing all subjects 
will emerge? 

Charles Vincent was caught 
up in one last enthusiasm. On 
a long vigil, as he consulted 
source after source and sorted 
them in his mind, it seemed 
that the pattern was coming 
out clearly and simply, for all 
its amazing complexity of de- 
tail. 

“I know everything that 
they know in the pit, and I 

129 




know a secret that they do not 
know. I have not lost the race 
— I have won it. I can defeat 
them at the point where they 
believe themselves invulnei> 
able. If controlled hereafter, 
we need at least not be con- 
trolled by them. It is all fall- 
ing together now. I have found 
the final truth, and it is they 
who have lost the race. I hold 
the key. I will now be able to 
enjoy the advantage without 
paying the ultimate price of 
defeat and destruction, or of 
collaboration with them. 

“Now I have only to imple- 
ment my knowledge, to publish 
the fact, and one shadow at 
least will be lifted from man- 
kind. I will do it at once. Well, 
nearly at once. It is almost 
dawn in the normal world. I 
will sit here a very little while 
and rest. Then I will go out 
and begin to make contact 
with the proper persons for 
the disposition of this thing. 
But first I will sit here a little 
while and rest.” 

And he died quietly in his 
chair as he sat there. 

D R. MASON made an entry 
in his private journal: 
“Charles Vincent, a com- 
pletely authenticated case of 
premature aging, one of the 
most clear-cut in all geron- 
tology. This man was known 
to me for years, and I here 
aver that as of one year ago 



he was of normal appearance 
and physical state, and that 
his chronology is also correct, 
I having also known his 
father. I examined the subject 
during the period of his ill- 
ness, and there is no question 
at all of his identity, which 
has also been established for 
the record by fingerprinting 
and other means. I aver that 
Charles Vincent at the age of 
thirty is dead of old age, hav- 
ing the appearance and or- 
ganic condition of a man of 
ninety.” 

Then the doctor began to 
make another note: “As in 
two other cases of my own 
observation, the illness was 
accompanied by a certain delu- 
sion and series of dreams, so 
nearly identical in the three 
men as to be almost unbeliev- 
able. And for the record, and 
no doubt to the prejudice of 
my own reputation, I will set 
down the report of them 
here.” 

But when Dr. Mason had 
written that, he thought about 
it for a while. 

“No, I will do no such 
thing,” he said, and he struck 
out the last lines he had writ- 
ten. “It is best to let sleeping
