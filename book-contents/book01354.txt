A New Science-Adventure Novel 



by ANDRE NORTON 



APRIL 1969 










PITY THE POOR READER! 



We've heard the sad story over and over at science-fiction 
meetings. Some reader was right in the middle of one of our 
award-winning serials when his magazine dealer goofed, and 
he missed an issue. Or he found the stand all sold out and 
never read the novelette every other fan is raving about now. 

Naturally, nobody wants to miss an issue of IF— the magazine 
that won the Hugo as Best in the field at the past two World 
Science Fiction Conventions. And surely nobody will want to 
miss the great stories and brand new features we are already 
scheduling for the future issue of IF. 

We try to make sure there are enough copies for every reader, 
but we can’t guarantee that you won’t miss an issue, un- 
fortunately. 

Only you can do that. And it’s really quite simple and will even 
save you money. Just fill in the coupon below— or if you hate

What We Think With 



B y now we all have heard about 
Australopithecus africanus and 
Professor Leakey’s paradoxical con- 
jecture that it isn’t really so much 
true that man invented tools as it is 
that tools invented mam We’ve dis- 
cussed the reasoning involved in 
these pages before: How the large 
bones the idiot Australopithecines 
used to kill their prey and theii 
enemies — the first tools — de- 
manded more agility in their use; 
how the increased mobility demand- 
ed increased nerve connections; how 
the increased sensory and nK)tor 
nerve networks demanded increased 
central nervous systems — that is, 
brains. But we’ve never before dis- 
cussed what those brains are. 

A new book by an old friend of 
Galaxy and If readers, H. Chandler 
Elliott — who is not only a science- 
fiction writer as time permits, but 
a professor of anatomy, neurology 
and psychiatry at the University of 
Nebraska College of Medicine — 
gives us as full a look at the struc- 
ture and workings of the brain 
as we have ever seen. (It’s called 
The Shape of Intelligence, and it’s 
just published by Scribners.) It’s a 
beautiful book, handsomely illus- 
trated by Anthony Ravielli — al- 



most too beautiful in a way, since 
it’s very likely that a number of 
copies will wind up on someone’s 
coffee table and will never be 
cracked except to admire the pretty 
illustrations. That will be a pity. For 
the trouble with the world, ih the 
troubles with the world, rest on what 
men do to it; and the only hope 
of curing them rests on understand- 
ing why men do what they do. And 
one cannot understand men’s minds 
without understanding the hardware 
that generates and forms them, the 
brain and nervous system. 

It takes Professor Elliott nearly 
300 pages to tell us what is now 
known about the brain. We can’t 
cover it in the space we have on this 
page. But he does — very authori- 
tatively, clearly and provocatively — 
and we commend the book to you. 

We’ve known all along that some 
of the best science-fiction writers 
were scientists; we’re glad to get fur- 
ther proof of the corollary, in books 
like this one. What distinguishes 
a first-rate scientist from a clod is 
his imagination and understanding. 
And we think that’s why it appears 
to be so that some of the best sci- 
entists are science-fiction writers, 
too. — THE EDITOR

FIRST OF TWO PARTS

TOYS 

OF TAMISAN 

by ANDRE NORTON 

Illustrated by ADKINS 



Tamisan built dreams for others. 
But now she was trapped in night- 
mare — and her dream was reality! 



I 

44 Che is certified by the Foost- 
mam, Lord Starrex. A true 
action dreamer to the tenth power/’ 
Jabis was being too eager, or al- 
most so; he was pushing too much, 
Tamisan sneered mentally, keeping 



her face carefully blank, though 
she took quick glances about from 
beneath half-closed eyelids. This 
sale very much concerned her, since 
she was the product being dis- 
cussed, but she had nothing to say 
in the matter. 

She supposed this was a typical 



5 





sky tower, seeming to float, masked 
in clouds at times, since its sup- 
ports were so slender and well con- 
cealed, lifting it high above Ty- 
Kry. However, none of the win- 
dows gave on real sky, but each 
framed a yery different landscape, 
illustrating what must be other 
planet scenes. Perhaps some were 
dream remembered or inspired. 

There was a living lambil grass 
carpet aroirnd the easirest on which 
the owner half lay, half sat. But 
Jabis had not even been offered a 
pull-down wall seat. And the two 
other men in attendance on Lord 
Starrex stood also. They were real 
men and not androids, which 
placed the owner in the multi- 
credit class. One, Tamisan thought 
was a body-guard, and the other, 
younger, thinner, with a dissatisfied 
mouth, had on clothing nearly 
equal to that of the man on the 
easirest but with a shade of differ- 
ence which meant a lesser place in 
the housdiold. 

Tamisan catalogued what she 
could see and filed it away for fu- 
ture reference. Most dreamers did 
not observe much of the world 
about them. They were too en- 
meshed in their own creations to 
care for reality. Most dreamers . 
Tamisan frowned. She was a dream- 
er. Jabis and the Foostmam could 
prove that The lounger on the 
easirest could prove it if he paid 
Jabis’ price. But she was also some- 
thing more. Tamisan herself was 
6 



not quite sure what And that there 
was a difference in her, she had 
had mother wit enough to conceal 
since she had first been aware that 
the others in the Foostmam’s Hive 
were not able to come cleanly out 
of their dreams into the here and 
now. Why, some of them had to be 
fed, clothed, cared for as if they 
were not aware they had any bod- 
ies! 

‘‘Action dreamer.” Lord Starrex 
shifted his shoulders against the 
padding which immediately accom- 
modated itself to his stirring to 
give him maximum comfort. “Action 
dreaming is a little childish — ” 

Tamisan’s control held, but she 
felt inside her a small flare of an- 
ger. Childish was it? She would 
like to show him just how childish 
a dream she could spin to enmesh 
a client. But Jabis was not in the 
least moved by that derogatory re- 
mark from a possible purchaser; it 
was in his eyes only a logical bar- 
gaining move. 

“If you wish an E dreamer — ” 
He shrugged. “But your demand 
to the Hive specified an A.” 

TTe was daring to be a little 

^ abrupt. Was he so sure of this 
lord as all that? He must have 
some inside information which al- 
lowed him to be so confident. For 
Jabis could cringe and belly-down 
in awe like the lowest beggar if he 
thought such a gesture needful to 
gain a credit or two. 



IF 




“Kas, this is your idea. What is 
she worth?” Starrex asked indiffer- 
ently. 

The younger of his companions 
moved forward a step or two. He 
was the reason for her being here 
— Lord Kas, cousin to the owner 
of all this magnificance; though 
certainly not, Tamisan had already 
deduced, with any authority in the 
household. But the fact that Star- 
rex lay in the easirest was not dic- 
tated by indolence, but rather by 
what was hidden by the fas-silk lap- 
robe concealing half his body. A 
man who might not walk straight 
again could find pleasure in the 
abilities of an action dreamer. 

“She has a ten-point rating,” Kas 
reminded the other. 

The black brows which gave a 
stern set to Starrex’s features arose 
a trifle. “Is that so?” 

Jabis was quick to take advan- 
tage. “It is so. Lord Starrex. Of all 
this year’s swarm, she rated the 
highest. It was — is — the reason 
why we make this offer to your 
lordship.” 

“I do not pay for reports only,” 
returned Starrex. 

Jabis was not to be ruffled. “A 
point ten, my lord, does not give 
demonstrations. As you know, the 
Hive accrediting can not be forged. 
It is only because I have urgent 
business in Brok and must leave 
for there that I am selling her at 
all. Though I have had an offer 
from the Foostmam herself to re- 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



tain this one for lease-outs — 

Tamisan, had she had anything 
to wager or someone with whom to 
wager it, would have set the win- 
ning of this bout with her uncle. 
Uncle? To Tamisan’s thinking she 
had no blood tie with this small 
insect of a man — with his wrin- 
kled face, his never-still eyes, his 
thin hands with their half-crooked 
fingers always reminding one of 
claws outstretched to grab and grab 
and grab. Surely her mother must 
have been very unlike Uncle Jabis, 
or else how could her father ever 
have seen aught worth bedding — 
not for just one night but for half 
a year — in her? 

]^Tot for the first time her 
thoughts were on the riddle of 
her parents. Her mother had not 
been a dreamer — though she had 
had a sister who had regrettably — 
for the sake of the family fortune 
— died in the Hive during adoles- 
cent stimulation as an E dreamer. 
Her father had been from off- 
world — an alien, though human- 
oid enough to crossbreed. And he 
had disap^)eared again off-world 
when his desire for star roving had 
become too strong to master. Had 
it not been that she had early 
shown dreamer talent. Uncle Jabis 
and the rest of the greedy Yeska 
clan would never have taken any 
thought of her after her mother had 
died of the blue plague. 

She was crossbred and had in- 

7 




telligence enough to guess early 
that this had given her the differ- 
ence between her powers and those 
of others in the Hive. The ability 
to dream was an in-bom talent. 
For those of low power, it was an 
indwelling withdrawal from the 
world. And those dreamers were 
largely useless. But the ones who 
could project dreams to include 
others — through linkage — 
brought high prices, according 
to the strength and stability of 
their creations. E dreamers who 
created erotic and lascivious other- 
worlds once rated more high- 
ly than action dreamers. But of 
late years, the swing had been in 
the opposite direction, though how 
long that might hold no one could 
guess. And those lucky enough to 
have an A dreamer to sell were 
pushing their wares speedily lest 
the market decline. 

Tamisan’s hidden talent was that 
she herself was never as complete- 
ly lost in the dream world as those 
she conveyed to it. Also — and this 
she had discovered very recently 
and hugged that discovery to her 
— she could in a measure control 
the linkage so she was never a pow- 
erless prisoner forced to dream at 
another's desire. 

She considered now what she 
knew concerning this Lord Star- 
rex. That Jabis would sell her to 
the owner of one of the sky towers 
had been clear from the first. And 
naturally he would select what he 
8 



thought would be the best bargain. 
But, though rumors wafted through 
the Hive, Tamisan believed that 
much of their news of the outer 
world was inaccurate and grabbled. 
Dreamers were roofed and walled 
from any real meeting with every- 
day life, their talents feverishly fed 
and fostered by long sessions with 
tri-dee projectors and information 
tapes. 

Qtarrex, unlike most of his class, 
^ had been a doer. He had bro- 
ken the pattern of caste by going 
off-world on lengthy trips. It was 
only after some mysterious acci- 

dent had crippled him that he be- 
came a recluse, supposedly hiding 
a maimed body. And he did not 
seem like those others who had 

come to the Hive seeking wares. 
Of course, it had been the tord 
Kas who had summoned them 

here. 

Stretched out on the easirest 
with that cover of fabulous silk 

across most of his body, he was 
hard to judge. But, she thought, 
standing he would top Jabis, and 
he seemed to be well muscled, 
more like his guardsman than his 
cousin. 

He had a face unusual in its 
plans, broad across the forehead 
and cheek bones, then slimming to 
a strong chin which narrowed to 
give his head a vaguely wedge- 
shaped line. He was dark-skinned, 
almost as dark as a space crewman. 

IF 




His hair was black, cut very short 
so that it was a tight velvety cap, 
in contrast to the longer strands of 
his cousin. 

His tunic — lutrax of a coppery- 
rust shade — was of rich material 
but less ornamated than that of the 
younger man. Its sleeves were 
wide and loose, and now and then 
he ran his hands up his arms, push- 
ing the fabric away from his skin. 
He wore only a single jewel, a 
koros stone set in an earring as a 
drop which dangled forward against 
his jaw line. 

Tamisan did not consider him 
handsome. But there was some- 
thing arresting about him. Perhaps 
it was his air of arrogant assm:- 
ance, as if in all his life he had 
never had his wishes crossed. He 
had not met Jabis before; and per- 
haps now even Lord Starrex would 
have something to learn. 

Twist and turn, indignant and 
persuasive, using every trick in a 
very considerable training for deal- 
ing and under-dealing, Jabis bar- 
gained. He appealed to gods and 
demons to witness his disinterested 
desire to please, his despair at be- 
ing misunderstood. It was quite a 
notable act, and Tamisan stored up 
some of the choicer bits in her men- 
tal reservoir for the making of 
dreams. It was far more stimulat- 
ing to watch then a tri-dee, and die 
wondered why this living drama 
material was not made available to 
the Hive. Unless, of course, the 



Foostmam and her assistants fear- 
ed it, along with any shred of re- 
ality which might awaken the 
dreamers from their conditioned 
albsorption in their own creations. 

For an instant or two she won- 
dered if the Lord Starrex was not 
enjoying it too. There was a kind 
of weariness in his face which sug- 
gested boredom, though that was 
the norm for anyone wanting a 
personal dreamer. Then suddenly 
as if he were tired of it all, he In- 
terrupted one of Jabis’ more im- 
passioned pleas for celestial under- 
standing of his need for receiving 
a just price with a single sentence. 

“I tire, fellow. Take your price 
and go.” He closed his eyes in dis- 
missal. 

II 

Tt was the guard who drew a 
credit plaque from his belt, 
swung a long arm over the back of 
the easirest for Lord Starrex to 
plant a thumb on its surface to cer- 
tify payment, and then tossed it to 
Jabis. It fell to the floor so the 
small man had to scrabble for it 
mih his finger claws, and Tamisan 
saw the look in his darting eyes. 
Jabis had little liking for Lord 
Starrex — which did not mean, of 
course, that he disdained the credit 
plaque he had to stoop to catch 
up. 

He did not give a glance to Tam- 
isan as he bowed himself out. And 



10 



IF 




she was left standing as if she were 
an android or a machine. It was 
the LfOrd Kas who stepped forward, 
touched her lightly on the arm as 
if he thought she needed guidance. 

‘‘Come,^’ he said, and his fingers 
about her wrist drew her after him. 
The Lord Starrex took no notice 
of his new possession. 

“What is your name?” Lord Kas 
spoke slowly, emphasizing each 
word as if he needed to do so to 
pierce some veil between them. 
Tamisan guessed that he had had 
contact with a lower-rated dream- 
er, one who was always bemused 
in the real world. Caution sug- 
gested that she allow him to be- 
lieve she was in a similiar daze. So 
she raised her head slowly, and 
looked at him, trying to give the 
appearance of one finding it diffi- 
cult to focus. 

“Tamisan,” she answered after a 
lengthy pause. “I be Tamisan.” 

“Tamisan — that is a pretty 
name,” he said as one would ad- 
dress a dull-minded child. “I am 
Lord Kas. I am your friend.” 

But Tamisan, sensitive to shades 
of voice, thought she had done 
well in pla3dng bemused. Whatever 
Kas might be, he was not her 
friend, at least not unless it served 
his purpose. 

“These rooms are yours.” He 
had escorted her down a hall to a 
far door where he passed his hand 
over the surface in a pattern to 
break some light-lock. Then his 



grip on her wrist brought her into 
a Iiigh-ceilinged room. There were 
no windows to break its curve of 
wall. The place was oval in shape. 
The center fell in a series of wide, 
shallow steps to a pool where a 
small fountain raised a perfumed 
mist to patter back into a bone- 
white basin. And on the steps were 
a number of cushions and soft lie- 
ons, all of many delicate shades of 
blue and green. While the oval 
walls were covered with a shimmer 
of rippling zidex webbing — pale 
gray covered with whirls and lines 
of palest green. 

A great deal of care had gone 
into the making and furnishing of 
that room. Perhaps she was only 
the latest in a series of dreamers, 
for this was truly the rest place — 
raised to a point of luxury un- 
known even in the Hive — for a 
dreamer. 

A strip of the web tapestry 
along the wall was raised, and 
a personal-care android entered. 
The head was only an oval ball 
with faceted eye-plates and hearing 
sensors to break its surface, its un- 
clothed, humanoid form ivory 
white. 

“This is Porpae,” Kas told her. 
“She will watch over you.” 

My guard, Tamisan thought. 
That the care the android would 
give her would be unceasing and 
of the best, she did net doubt, any 
more than that the ivory being 

11 



TOYS OF TAMISAN 




would stand between her and any 
hope of freedom. 

‘‘If you have any wish, tell it to 
Porpae.” Kas droi^d his hold on 
her arm, turned to the door. “When 
the Lord Starrex wishes to dream 
he wiU send for you.” 

“I am at his command,” she 
mumbled the proper response. 

She watched Kas leave and then 
looked to Porpae. Tamison had good 
cause to believe that the android 
was programmed to record her 
every move. But would anyone here 
believe that a dreamer had any de- 
sire to be free? A dreamer wished 
only to dream; it was her life, her 
entire life. And to leave a place 
which did all to foster such a life 
— that would be akin to self-kill- 
ing, something a certified dreamer 
could not think of. 

“I hunger,” she told the an- 
droid. “I would eat.” 

“Food comes.” Porpae went to 
the wall and swept aside the web 
once more to display a series of 
buttons she pressed in a compli- 
cated manner. 

When the food arrived in a 
closed tray with the viands each in 
its own hot or cold compartment, 
Tamisan ate. She recognized the 
usual dishes of a dreamer’s diet, 
but better cooked and more tastily 
served than in the Hive. She ate; 
she made use of the bathing place 
Porpae guided her to behind an- 
other wall web, and she slept easily 
and without stirring on the cush- 



ions beside the pool where the 
faint play of the water lulled her 
gently. 

Time had very little meaning in 
the oval room. She ate, slept, 
bathed and looked upon the- tri- 
dees she asked Porpae to supply. 
Had she been as the others from 
the Hive, this existence would have 
been ided. But instead, when there 
was no call to display her art, she 
grew restless. She was prisoner here, 
and none of the other inhabitants 
of the sky tower seemed aware of 
her. 

There was one thing she could 
do, Tamisan decided upon her sec- 
ond waking. A dreamer was allowed 
— no, required — to study the per- 
sonality of the master she must 
serve, if she were a private dream- 
er and not a leasee of the Hive. 
She had a right now to ask for 
tapes concerning Starrex. In fact, 
it might be considered odd if she 
did not, and accordingly she called 
for those. Thus she learned some- 
thing of ^r master and his house- 
hold. 

Kas had had his personal for- 
tune wiped out by some catastrophe 
when he was a diild. He had been 
in a manner adopted by Starrex’s 
father, the head of their clan, and 
since Starrex’s injuries Kas had 
acted in some fashion as his depu- 
ty. The guard was Ulfilas, an off- 
world mercenary Starrex had 
brought back from one of his star 
voyages. 



12 



IF 




T>ut Starrex, save for a handful 
of bare facts, remained more 
or less of an enigma. That he had 
any human responses to others 
Tamisaiv began to doubt. He had 
gone seeking change off-world, but 
what he might have found there 
had not cured his eternal weariness 
of life. And his personal recordings 
were meager. She now believed 
that, to him, any one of his house- 
hold was only a tool to be used or 
swept from his path and ignored. 
He was unmarried and such fem- 
inine companionship as he had lan- 
guidly attached to his household 
— and that more by the effort of 
the woman involved than through 
any direct action on his part — 
did not last long. In fact, he was 
so encased in a shell of indiffer- 
ence that Tamisan wondered if 
there was any longer a real man 
within that outer covering. 

She began to speculate as to why 
he had allowed Kas to bring her 
as an addition to his belongings. 
To make the best use of a dreamer, 
the owner must be rea^ to par- 
take, and what she reaa in these 
tapes suggested that Starrex’s in- 
difference would raise a barrier to 
any real dreaming. 

But the more Tamisan learned 
in this negative fashion, the more 
it seemed a challenge. She lay be- 
side the pool in deep thought — 
though that thought strayed even 
more than she herself guessed from 
the rigid mental exercises used by 



a point ten dreamer. To deliver a 
dream which would captivate Star- 
rex was indeed a challenge. He 
wanted action, but her training, 
acute as it had been, was not 
enough to entice him. Therefore — 
her action must be able to take a 
novel turn. 

This was an age of over-sophis- 
tication — when star travel was a 
fact, when outer action existed in 
reality. And by these tapes, though 
they were not detailed as to what 
Starrex had done off-world, the 
lord had experienced much — the 
reality of his time. 

So — he must be served the un- 
known. She had read nothing in 
the tapes to suggest that Starrex 
had sadistic or perverted tenden- 
cies. And she knew if he were to 
be reached in such a fashion, she 
was not the one to do it. Also Kas 
would have stated such a require- 
ment at the Hive. 

There were many rolls of history 
on which one could draw — but 
those had also been mined and re- 
mined. The future — that again 
had been over-used, frayed. Tami- 
san ’s dark brows drew together 
above her closed eyes. Trite — ev- 
erything she thought of was trite! 
Why did she care anyway? She did 
not even know why it had become 
so strong a drive to build a dream 
that, when she was called upon to 
deliver it, would shake Starrex out 
of his shell — to prove to him that 
she was worth her rating. Maybe 



TOYS OF TAMISAN 



13 




it was partly because he had made 
DO move to send for her and try 
to prove her powers, his indiffer- 
ence suggesting that he thought 
she had nothing to offer. 

'^apes — she had the right to 
call upon the full library of 
the Hive, and it was the most com- 
plete in the star lanes. Why, ships 
were sent out for no other reason 
than to bring back new knowledge 
to feed the imaginations of the 
dreamers! 

History. Her mind kept return- 
ing to the past, though it was too 
thread-bare for her purposes. His- 
tory — what was history? A series 
of events — actions by individuals, 
or nations. Actions had results. 
Tamisan sat up among her cush- 
ions. Results of action! Sometimes 
there were far-reaching results from 
a single action — the death of a 
ruler, the outcome of one battle, 
the landing of a star ship — or its 
failure to land. 

So — 

Her flicker of idea became solid. 
History could have had many roads 
to travel beside the one already 
known. Now — could she make use 
of that? 

Why, it had imuunerable possi- 
bilities! Tamisan’s hands clench- 
ed the robe lying across her 
knees. Study — she would have to 
study! And if Stajrex only gave her 
more time . She no longer re- 
sented his indifference now. She 



would need every minute it was 
prolonged. 

“Porpae!” 

The android materialized from 
behind the web. 

“I must have certain tapes from 
the Hive.” Tamisan hesitated. In 
spite of the spin of impatience, she 
must build smoothly and surely. 
‘‘A message to the Foostmam: send 
to Tamisan n’ Starrex the rolls of 
the history of Ty-Kry for the past 
five hundred years.” 

The history of a single city and 
that of the one which based this 
sky tower! Begin small so she 
could test and retest her idea. To- 
day a single city, tomorrow a 
world, and then — who knew — 
perhaps a solar system! She reined 
in her excitement. There was much 
to do. She needed a note recorder 
— and time. But by the Four 
Breasts of Vlasta — if she could do 
it! 

It would seem she would have 
time, though always at the back of 
Tamisan’s mind was the small 
spark of fear that at any moment 
the summons to Starrex might 
come. But the tapes arrived from 
the Hive and the recorder, so that 
die swung from one to the other, 
taking notes from what she learned. 
Then after the tapes had been re- 
tinned, she studied those notes fev- 
eridily. Now her idea meant more 
to her than just a device to amuse 
a difficult master; it absorbed her 
utterly, as if she were a low-grade

dreamer caught in one of her own 
creations. 

When Tamisan realized the dan- 
ger of this, she broke with her 
studies and turned back to the 
household tapes to learn again 
what she could of Starrex. 

T)ut she was again running 
through her notes when at last 
the summons came. How long she 
had been in Starrex’s tower she did 
not know, for days and nights in the 
oval room were all alike. Only Por- 
pae^s watchfulness had kept her to 
a routine of* eating and rest. 

It was the Lord Kas who came 
for her, and she had just time to 
remember her role of bemused 
dreamer as he entered. 

“You are well and happy?” He 
used the conventional greeting. 

“I enjoy the good life.” 

“It is the Lord Starrex’s wish that 
he enter a dream.” Kas reached 
for her hand, and she allowed his 
touch. “The Lord Starrex demands 
much. Offer him your best, dream- 
er.” He might have been warning 
her. 

“A dreamer dreams,” she an- 
swered him vaguely. “What is 
dreamed can be shared.” 

“True. But the Lord Starrex is 
hard to please. Do your best for 
him, dreamer.” 

She did not answer, and he drew 
her on, out of the room to a grav 
shaft and down that to a lower level. 
The room into which they finally 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



went had the apparatus very fa- 
miliar to her — a couch for the 
dreamer, the second for the sharer 
with the linkage machine between. 
But here was a third couch. Tami- 
san looked at it in surprise. 

“Two dream, not three.” 

Kas shook his head. “It is the 
Lord Starrex’s will that another 
shares also. The linkage is of a new 
model, very powerful. It has been 
well tested.” 

Who would be that . third? Ul- 
filas? Was it that Lord Starrex 
thought he must take his personal 
guard into a dream with him? 

The door swung open again, and 
Lord Starrex entered. He walked 
stiffly, one leg swinging wide as if 
he could not bend the knee nor 
control the muscles, and he leaned 
heavily on an android. As the ser- 
vant lowered him onto the couch, 
he did not look to Tamisan but 
nodded curtly to Kas. 

“Take your place also,” be 
ordered. 

Did Starrex fear the dream state 
and want his cousin as a check be- 
cause Kas had plainly dreamed be- 
fore? 

Then Starrex turned to her as he 
reached for the dream cap, cop3dng 
the motion by which she settled her 
own circlet on her head. 

“Let us see what you can do.” 
There was a shadow of hostility in 
his voice, a challenge to produce 
something which he did not believe 
she could do.

Ill 

S he mus£ not allow herself to think 
of Starrex now, only of her 
dream« She must create and have 
no fear that her creation would be 
less perfect than her hopes. Tami- 
san dosed her eyes, firmed her will 
and drew into her imagination all 
the threads of the studies’ spinning. 
She began the weaving of a dream. 

For a moment, perhaps two fin- 
gers’ count of moments, this was 
like the beginning of any dream 
and then — 

• She was not looking on, watching 
intently, critically, a fabric she 
spim with dexterity. No, it was 
rather as if that web suddenly be- 
came real and she was caught 
tightly in it, even as a blue-winged 
drotail might be enmeshed in a 
foss-spider’s deadly nest curtain 1 
This was no dreaming such as 
Tamisan had ever known before, 
and panic gripped so harshly in 
her throat and chest that she might 
have screamed, save that she had 
no voice left. She fell down and 
down from a point above, to strike 
among bushes which took some of 
her weight, but with an impact 
which left her bruised and half 
senseless. She lay immoving, gasp- 
ing, her eyes closed, fearing to open 
them to see that she was indeed 
caught in a wild nightmare and not 
properly dreaming. 

As she lay there, she came slowly 
out of her dazed bewilderment; she 



tried to get c6ntrol| not only oyer 
her fear^ but hea: akeaming powers. 
Then she pp^eg her eyes cautious- 

ly- 

An arch of sky was overhead, 
palidly green, with traces, like long, 
clutching fingers, of thin gray cloud. 
As real as any sky might be, did 
she walk imder it in her own time 
and world. Her own time and world! 

The idea she had built upon to 
astound Starrex came back to her 
now. Had the fact that she had 
worked with a new theory, trying 
to bring a twist to dreaming which 
might pierce the indifference of a 
bored man precipitated this? 

Tamisan sat up, wincing at the 
protest of her bruises, to look about 
her. Her vantage point was the 
crest of a small knob of earth. But 
the land about her was no wilder- 
ness. The turf was smooth and 
cropped, and here and there were 
outcrops of rock cleverly carved 
and clothed with flowering vines 
— some of them; others were stark- 
ly bare, brooding. And all faced 
down slope to a wall. 

These forms varied from vaguely 
acceptable humanoid shapes to 
grotesque monsters. And Tamisan 
decided that she liked the aspect 
of none when she studied them 
more closely. There were not of her 
imagining. 

Beyond the wall began a cluster 
of buildings. Used to seeing the sky 
towers and the lesser, if more sub- 
stantial structures beneath those 



16 



IF 




which were of her own world, these 
looked unusually squat and heavy. 
The highest she could see from here 
was no more than three stories. Men 
did not build to the stars here, they 
hugged the earth closely. 

T>ut where was here? Not her 
dream — Tamisan closed her 
eyes and concentrated on the be- 
ginnings of her planned dream. ' 
That had been about going into an- 
other world, bom of her imagining, 
yes — but not this I Her basic idea 
had been simple enough, if not one 
which had been used to her knowl- 
edge by any dreamer before her. 
It all hinged on the idea that the 
past history of her world had been 
altered many times during its flow 
— and she had taken three key- 
points of alteration, studied on 
what might have resulted had those 
been given the opposite decision by 
fate. 

Now, keeping her eyes firmly 
closed against this seeming reality 
into which she had fallen, Tamisan 
concentrated with fierce intentness 
upon her chosen points. 

“The Welcome of the Over- 
Queen Ahta — ” she recited the 
first. 

What if the first star ship on its 
landing had not been accepted as 
a supernatural event and the small 
kingdom in which it had touched 
earth had not accepted its crew as 
godlings, but rather had greeted 
them instead with those poisoned 



darts the spacemen had later seen 
used? That was her first dedsion. 

“The loss of the Wanderer.” 
That was the second. 

A colony ship driven far from its 
assigned course by computer fail- 
ure, so that it had had to make a 
landing here or let its passengers 
die. If that failure had not occmred 
and the Wanderer not landed to 
start an unplanned colony . 

“The death of Sylt the Sweet- 
Tongued before he reached the 
Altar of Ictio.” 

A prophet who might never have 
arisen to ruthless power, leading to 
a blood-crazed insurrection from 
temple to temple, setting darkness 
on three-quarters of this world. 

She had chosen those points, but 
she had not even been sure that one 
might not have canceled out an- 
other. 

Sylt had led the rebellion 
against the colonists from the Wan- 
derer. If the welcome had not 
occurred . Tamisan could not be 
sure — she had only tried to find 
a pattern sequence of events and 
then envision a modern world 
stemming from those changes. 

However • — she opened her eyes 
again — this was not her imagined 
world I Nor did one in a dream rub 
bruises, sit on damp sod, feel wind 
pull at clothes, and allow the first 
patter of rain to wet hair and robe. 
She put both hands to her head — 
what of the dream cap? 

Her fingers found a weaving of

metal right enough, but there were 
DO cords from it. And for the first 
time she remembered that she had 
been link^ with Starrex and Kas 
when this happened. 

jamisah got to her feet to look 
around her, half expecting to see 
the other two somewhere near. But 
she was alone, and the rain was 
falling heavier. There was a roofed 
space near the wall, and Tamisan 
hurried for it. 

Thred twisted pillars supported 
a small dome of roof. There were 
no Wa^, and she huddled in the 
very center, trying to escape the 
wind-bome moisture. She cotild not 
keep pushing away the feeling that 
this was no dream but true reality. 

If — if one could dream imel 
Tamisan fought panic and tried to 
examine the possibilities. Eai she 
somehow landed in a Ty-Kry which 
might have existed had her three 
checkpoints actually been the de- 
cisions she envisioned? If so — 
could one get back by simply 
visioning them in reverse? 

She shut her eyes and concen- 
trated . 

T here was a sensation of stom- 
ach-turning giddiness. She 
swung out, to be jerked back — 
swung out, to return once more. 
Shaking with nausea, Tamisan stop- 
ped trying. She shuddered, opening 
her eyes to the rain. Then again she 
strove to understand what had hap- 
pened. That swing had in it some of 



the sensation of dream breaking. It 
didi Which meant that she was in a 
^eam. But it was just as apparent 
that she had been held priscmer 
here. How? And why? Or — ^her eyes 
narrowed a little, though she was 
looking inward, not at the rain- 
misted garden before her — by 
whom?, 

Suppose — suppose one or both 
of those who had prepared to share 
her dream had also come into this 
place — though not right here — 
then she must find them. They must 
return together or the missing one 
would anchor the others. Find them 
— and now! 

For the first time she looked 
down at the garment clinging dank 
and damp to her slender body. It 
was not the gray slip of a dreamer, 
for it was long, brushing her ankles. 
And in color it was a dusky violet, 
a shade she found strangely pleas- 
ing and right. 

Frmn its hem to her knees there 
was a border of intricate embroidery 
so entwined and ornate that she 
found it hard to define in any de- 
tail, though it seemed oddly enough 
that the longer she studied it, the 
more it appeared to be not threads 
on cloth, W words on a page of 
manuscript such as she had viewed 
in the ancient history video tapes. 
The threads were a metallic green 
and silver, with only a few minor 
touches of a lighter shade of violet. 

Around her waist was a belt of 
silver links, clasped by a broad 



13 



IF 




buckle of the same metal set with 
purple stones. This supported a 
pouch with a metal top. The dress 
or robe was laced from the belt to 
her throat with silver cords run 
through metal eyelets in the ma- 
terial. And her sleeves were long 
and full, though from the elbow 
down they were slit to four parts, 
those fluttering away from her arms 
when she raised them to loose the 
crown. 

What she brought away from her 
head was not the familiar skull cap 
made to fit over her cropped hair. 
Rather it was a circlet of silver with 
inner wires or strips rising to a 
conical point that added a foot or 
more to her height. On that point 
was a beautifully-fashioned flying 
thing, its wings a little lifted as if 
to take off, the glitter of tiny 
jewels marking its eyes. 

It was so made that, as she 
turned the crown around, its long 
neck changed position and the 
wings moved a fraction. Thus at 
first sh6 was almost startled enough 
to drop the circlet, thinking it 
might just be alive. 

But the whole she recognized 
from one of the history tapes. The 
bird was the flacar of Olava. Wear- 
ing it so meant that she was a 
Mouth! A Mouth of Olava — half 
priestess, part sorceress — and oddly 
enough, entertainer. But fortune 
had favored her in this; a Mouth 
of Olava might wander anywhere 
without question, searching, and 



seem merely to be about her nor- 
mal business. 

Tamisan ran her hand over her 
head before she replaced the crown. 
Her fingers did not find the bristly 
stubble of a dreamer, but rather 
soft, mist-damp^ed strands which 
curled down long enough to brush 
her forehead and tuft at the nape 
of her neck. 

Qhe had imagined garments for 
herself in dreams, of course. But 
this time she had not provided her- 
self with such, and so the fact that 
she stood as a Mouth of Olava 
was not of her willing. But Olava 
was part of the time of the Over- 
Queen’s rule. Had she somehow 
swept herself back in time? The 
sooner she found knowledge of 
where — and when — she was, the 
better. 

The rain was slackening and 
Tamisan moved out from under the 
dome. She bunched up her robe in 
both hands to dimb back up the 
slope. At its top she turned slowly, 
trying to find some proof that she 
had not been tossed alone into this 
strange world. 

Save for the figures of stone and 
beds of rank-looking growth, there 
was nothing to be seen. The wall 
and the dome structure lay below. 
But when she faced about, there 
was a second slope leading to a still 
higher point which was crowned by 
a roof to be seen only in bits and 
patches through a screen of oarn 



TOYS OF TAMISAN

trees. The roof had a ridge which 
terminated at either side in a sharp 
upcurve, giving the building the 
odd appearance of an ear on either 
end. And it was green with a glit- 
tering surface, almost brilliantly so 
in spite of the. clouds overhead. 

To her right and left Tamisan 
caught glimpses of the wall curving, 
and more stone figures with flower 
or shrub plantings. Gathering up 
her skirts more firmly, she began 
to walk up the cinve of the higher 
slope in search of some road or 
path leading to the roof. 

She came across what she sought 
as she detoured to avoid a thicket 
of heavy brush in which were im- 
paled huge scarlet flowers. It was 
a wide roadway paved with small 
colored pebbles imbedded in a 
solid surface, and it led from an 
open gateway up the swell of the 
slope to the front of the rear struc- 
ture. 

In shape the building was vague- 
ly familiar, though Tamisan could 
not identify it. Unless is resembled 
something she had seen in the tri- 
dees. The door was of the same 
brilliant green as her roof, but the 
walls were a pale yellow, cut sharp- 
ly at regular intervals by windows, 
very narrow, and so tall that they 
ran from floor to roof level. 

Even as she stood there wonder- 
ing where she had seen such a house 
before, a woman came out. Like 
Tamisan she wore a long skirted 
robe with laced bodice and slit 



sleeves. But hers was the same green 
as that of the door, so that, stand- 
ing against it, only her head and 
arms were clearly visible. She ges- 
tured with vigor, and Tamisan sud- 
denly realized that it must be she 
who was being summoned — as if 

she were expected 

Again she fought down imease. 
In a dream she was well used to 
meetings and partings, but always 
those were of her own devising, did 
not happen for a purpose which was 
not of her wish. Her dream peqple 
were toys, game pieces, to be moved 
hither and thither at her will, she 
being always in command over 
them. 

‘‘Tamisan — they wait — come 
quickly!” The woman called. 

IV 

'^amisan was minded in that in- 
stant to run in the other di- 
rection. But the need to learn what 
had happened to her made her take 
what might be the dangerous 
course of joining the woman. 

“Fah — you are wet! This is no 
hour for walking in the garden. The 
First Standing asks for a reading 
from the Mouth. If you would have 
lavishly from her purse, hurry lest 
she grows too impatient to wait!” 
The door gave upon a narrow 
entryway, and the woman in green 
propelled Tamisan toward a second 
opening directly facing her. She 
came so into a large room where a 



20 



IF 




circle of couches was centered. By 
each stood a small table now bur- 
dened with dishes which serving 
maids were bearing away as if a 
meal had just been concluded. And 
tall candlesticks, matching Tami- 
san’s own height, stood also between 
the divans, the candles in each, as 
thick as her forearm, alight to give 
forth not only radiance but a sweet 
odor as they burned. 

Midpoint in the divan circle was 
a tall-backed chair over which 
arched a canopy. And in that sat 
a woman, a goblet in her hand. She 
had a fur cloak pulled about her 
shoulders hiding almost all of her 
robe, save that here and there a 
shimmer of gold caught fire from 
the candlelight. Only her face was 
visible in a hood of the same me- 
tallic-seeming fabric, and it was that 
of the very old, seamed with deep 
wrinkles, sunken of eye. 

The divans, Tamisan marked, 
were occupied by both men and 
women, the women flanking the 
chair, the men fartherest away from 
the ancient noblewoman. And di- 
rectly facing her was a second im- 
pressive chair, lacking only the 
canopy; before it was a table on 
which stood, at each of its four 
corners, four small basins, one 
cream, one pale rose, one faintly 
blue, and the fourth sea-foam green. 

Tamisan’s store of knowledge 
gave her some preparation. This was 
the setting for the magic of a 
Mouth, and it was apparent that 



her service as a foreseer was aliout 
to be demanded. What had she done 
in allowing herself to be drawn 
here? Could she make pretense her 
servant well enough to deceive this 
company? 

hunger. Mouth of Olava, I 
hunger — not for that which will 
feed the body, but for that which 
satisfies the mind.” The old wom- 
an leaned forward a little. Her 
voice might be the thin one of age, 
but it carried with it the force of 
authority, of one who has not had 
her word or desire questioned for 
a long time. 

Qhe must improvise, Tamisan 
^ knew. She was a dreamer and 
she had wrought in dreams many 
strange things. Let her but remem- 
ber that now. Her damp skirts 
clung clammily to her legs and 
Jhighs as she came forward, saying 
nothing to the woman in return, 
but seating herself in the chair 
facing her client. She was drawing 
on faint stirrings of a memory 
which seemed not truly her own for 
guidance, though she had not yet 
realized that fully. 

“What would you know. First 
Standing?” She raised her hands 
to her forehead in an instinctive 
gesture, touching forefingers to her 
temples, right and left. 

“What comes to me — and mine.” 
The last two words had come al- 
most as an afterthought. 

Tamisan’s hands went out with- 



TOYS OF TAMISAN 



21 




out her conscious ordering. She 
stiffled her amazement — this was 
as if she were repeating an act as 
well learned as her dreamer’s 
technique had been. With her left 
hand she gathered up a palm full 
of the sand from the cream bowl. 
It was a shade or two darker than 
the container. She tossed this with 
a sharp movement of her wrist, and 
it settled smoothly as a film on the 
tabletop. 

What she was doing was not of 
her conscious mind, as if another 
had taken charge of her actions. 
And judging by the way the woman 
in the chair leaned forward, the 
hush that had fallen on her com- 
panions, this was right and proper. 

Without any order from her 
mind, Tamisan’s ri^t hand went 
now to the blue bowl with its dark 
blue sand. But this was not tossed. 
Instead, she held the fine grains 
in her &t and that upright, passing 
it slowly over the table top so that 
a very tiny trickle of grit fed down 
to m^e a pattern on the first film. 

And it was a pattern, not a ran- 
dom scattering. What she had so 
drawn was a recognizable sword 
with a basket-shaped hilt and a 
slightly curved blade tapering to 
a narrow point. 

Now her hand moved to the pink 
bowl. The sand she gathered up 
there was a dark red, more vivid 
than the other colors, as if she 
dealt now with flecks of newly 
shed blood. Once more she used 



her upheld fist, and the shifting 
stream, fed from her palm, became 
a space ship I It was idightly dif- 
ferent in outline from those she had 
seen all her life, but it was unmis- 
takably a ship. And it was drawn 
on the table top as if it threatened 
to descend upon the pointed sword. 
Or was it that the sword threatened 
it? 

She heard a gasp of surprise — 
or was it fear? But that sound had 
not come from the woman who had 
bade her foretell. It must have 
broken from some other member 
of the company intent upon Tami- 
san’s painting with the flowing sand 

Tt was to the fourth bowl now 
that her right hand moved. But 
she did not take up a full fistful, 
rather a generous pinch between 
thumb and forefinger. She held the 
sand high above the picture and 
released it. The green specks 
floated down — to gather in a sign 
like a circle with one portion miss- 
ing. 

She stared at that, and it seemed 
to alter a little under the intent- 
ness of her watching. What it had 
changed to was a symbol she knew 
well, one which brought a small 
gasp from her. It was the seal, 
simplified it was true, but still 
readable, of the House of Starrex, 
and it overlaid both the edge of 
the ship and the tip of the sword. 

“Read you this! ” The noble- 
woman demanded sharply. 



22 



IF 




And from somewhere the words 
came readily to Tamisan. ‘The 
sword is the sword of Ty-Kry 
raised in defense.” 

“Assured, assured.” The murmur 
ran along the divans. 

“Tlie ship comes as a danger — ” 
“That thing — a ship? But it is 
no ship — ” 

“It is a ship from the stars.” 
“A woe — ^woe and woe — ” That 
was no murmur now but a full 
throated cry of fright. “As in the 
days of our fathers when we had to 
deal with the false ones. Ahtap — 
let the spirit of Ahta be shield to 
our arms, a sword in our hands!” 
The noblewoman made a silenc- 
ing gesture with one hand. “Enough! 
Crying to the reverend spirits may 
bring comfort, but they are not 
noted for helping those not standing 
to arms on their own behalf. There 
have been other sky ships since 
Ahta’s days, and with them we have 
dealt — to our purpose. If another 
comes, we are forewarned, which 
is also forearmed. But what lies 
there in green, 0 Mouth of Olava, 
which surprised even you?” 
Tamisan had had precious mo- 
ments in which to think. If it were 
true as she had deduced, that she 
was tied to this world by those she 
had brought with her, then she 
must find them. And it was clear 
that they were not of this company. 
Therefore this last must be made 
to work for her. 

“The green sign is that of a 



champion, one meant to be mighty 
in the coming battle. But he shall 
not be known save when the sign 
points to him, and it may be that 
this can only be seen by one with 
the Eyes.” 

Ohe looked to the noblewoman, 
and,meeting those old eyes, Tam- 
isan felt a small chill rise in her, 
one which had not been bom from 
the still damp clothing she wore. 
For there was that in those two 
shadowed eyes which questioned 
coldly and did not accept without 
proof. 

“So should the one with the Eye 
you speak of go sniffing all through 
Ty-Kry and the land beyond the 
city, even to the boundaries of the 
world?” 

“If need be,” Tamisan stood 
firm. 

“A long journey, mayhap, and 
many step-strides into danger. And 
if the ship comes before this cham- 
pion is found? A thin cord I think, 
0 Mouth, on which to hang the 
future of a city, a kingdom or a 
people. Look if you will, but I say 
we have more tested ways of deal- 
ing with these interlopers from the 
skies. But, Mouth, since you have 
given warning, let it so be remem- 
bered.” 

She put her hands on the arms 
of her chair and arose, using them 
to lever her. And so all her com- 
pany came to their feet, two of the 
women hurrying to her so that she 



TOYS Cf TAMISAN 



23 




could lay her hands upon their 
shoulders to support her out. With- 
out another glance at Tamisan she 
went, nor did the dreamer rise to 
see her go. For suddenly she was 
spent, tired as she had been in the 
past when a dream broke and left 
her supine and drained. Only this 
dream did not break, but kept her 
sitting before the table and its sand 
pictxures, looking at that green sym- 
bol, still caught fast in the web of 
another world. 

The woman in green returned, 
bearing a goblet in her two hands, 
offering it to Tamisan. 

“The First Standing will go to 
the High Castle and the Over- 
Queen. She turned into that road. 
Drink, Tamisan, and mayhap the 
Over-Queen herself will ask you for 
a seeing.” 

Tamisan? That was her true 
name. Twice this woman had called 
her by it. How was it known in a 
dream? Yet she dared not ask 
that question or any of the others 
she needed answers for. Instead she 
drank from the goblet, finding the 
liquid hot and spicy, driving the 
chill from her body. 

There was so much she must 
learn, must know, and she could 
not discover it save indirectly, lest 
she reveal what she was and was 
not. 

“I am tired.” 

“There is a resting place pre- 
pared,” the woman said. ‘“You 
have only to come — ” 



Tamisan had almost to lever her- 
self up as the noblewoman had 
done. She was giddy, had to catch 
at the back of the chair. Then she 
moved after her hostess, hoping 
desperately to know . 

V 

D id one sleep in a dream, dream 
upon dream, perhaps? Tamisan 
wondered about that as she stretch- 
ed out upon the couch her hostess 
showed her. Yet when she set aside 
her crown and laid her head upon 
the roll which served as a pillow, 
she was once more alert, her 
thoughts racing or entangled in 
such wild confusion that she felt 
as giddy as she had upon rising 
from her seer^s chair. 

The Starrex symbol overl3ung 
both that of the sword and the 
space ship in the sand picture 
— could it mean that she would 
only find what she sought when the 
might of this world met that of the 
starmen? And had she indeed in 
some manner fallen into the past 
where she would relive the first 
coming of the space voyagers to 
Ty-Kry? But no, the noblewoman 
had mentioned past encounters 
with them which had ended in favor 
of Ty-Kry. 

Tamisan tried to envision a 
world of her own time, but one in 
which history had taken a different 
road. Yet much of that around her 
was of the past. Did that mean that. 



24 



IF 




without the decisions of her own 
time, the world of Ty-Kry remained 
largely unchanged from century to 
century? 

Real, unreal, old, now — she had 
lost all a dreamer’s command of 
action. Tamisan did not play now 
with toys which she codd move 
about at will, but rather was caught 
up in a series of events she could 
not foresee and over which she had 
no control. Yet twice the woman 
had called her by her rightful name 
— and without willing it she 'had 
used the devices of a Mouth of 
Olava to foretell, as if she had done 
so many times before. 

Could it be? Tamisan closed her 
teeth upon her lower lip and felt 
the pain of that, just as she felt 
the pain of the bruises left by her 
abrupt entrance into the mysteri- 
ous here. Could it be that some 
dreams were so deep, so well woven 
that they were to the dreamer real? 
Was this indeed the fate of those 
“closed” dreamers who were worth- 
less for the Hive? Did they in their 
trances live a countless number of 
lives? But she was not a closed 
dreamer — 

Awake! Once more, stretched as 
she was upon the couch, she used 
the proper technique to throw her- 
self out of a dream. And once more 
she experienced that weird noth- 
ingness in which she spun sicken- 
ingly, as if held helplessly in some 
void, tied to an anchor which kept 
her back from the full leap to sane 



safety. There was only one e^Iana- 
tion — that somewhere in this 
strange Ty-Kry one or both of 
those who had pr^ared to share her 
dream was now to be foimd and 
must be sought out before she could 
return. 

So — the sooner that she accom- 
plished, the better! But w'here 
should she start seeking? Though 
a feeling of weakness climg to her 
limbs, making her move slowly as 
if she strove to walk against the 
pull of a strong current, Tamisan 
arose from the couch. She turned to 
pick up her Mouth’s crown and so 
looked into the oval of a mirror, 
startled thus into immobility. For 
the figure she looked upon as her 
own reflection was not that she had 
seen before. 

Tt was not the robe or the crown 
which had changed her; she 
was not the same person. For a 
long time, ever since she could 
remember, she had had the pallid 
skin and the close cropped hair of 
a dreamer very seldom in the sun- 
light. But the face of the woman 
in the mirror was a soft, even 
brown. The cheekbones were wide, 
the eyes large, the lips very red. 
Her brows — she leaned closer to 
the mirror to see what gave them 
that odd upward slant and decided 
that they had been plucked or 
shaven to produce the effect. Her 
hair was perhaps three fingers long 
and not her very fair coloring, but 



TOYS OF TAMISAN 



25 




dark and curling. She was not the 
Tamisan she knew, nor was this 
stranger the product of her own 
will. 

And it must follow logically that 
if she did not look like her normal 
self — then perhaps the two she 
sought were no longer as she re- 
membered either. Thus her search 
would be twice the more difficult. 
Could she ever recognize them? 

Fri^tened now, she sat down on 
the couch, facing the mirror. No, 
she dared not even give way to fear. 
For if she once let it break her con- 
trol she might be utterly lost. Logic, 
even in such a world of unlogic, 
must make her think lucidly. 

Just how true was her soothsay- 
ing? At least she had not influenced 
that fall of the sand. Therefore — 
perhaps the Mouth of Olava did 
have supernatural powers. She had 
fdayed with the idea of magic in 
the past to embroider dreams, but 
that had been her own creation. 
Could she use it by will now — ^since 
it would seem this unknown self of 
hers did manage to draw upon some 
unknown source of power? 

Fasten her thoughts upon one of 
the men, hold him in her mind-— 
could the dream tie pull her to him? 
Kas or Starrex? All she knew of 
her master she had learned from 
tapes, and tapes gave one only 
superficial knowledge, as if one 
could study a person going through 
only half-understood actions be- 
hind a veil which concealed more 



than it displayed. Kas had spoken 
directly to her, his flesh had 
touched hers. If she must choose 
one to draw her, then it had better 
be Kas. 

Kas — ^in her mind Tamisan built 
a memory sketch of him as she 
would build a preliminary picture 
for a dream. Then suddenly the 
Kas in her mind flickered and 
changed. She saw another man. He 
was taller than the Kas die knew, 
and he wore a imiform tunic and 
space boots — his features were 
hard to distinguish — and that 
vision lasted only a fraction of time. 

The Shipl That symbol had lain 
touching both ship and sword in 
the sand seeing. And it would be 
easier to seek a man on the ship 
than wandering through the 
streets of a strange city with no 
better clue than that Starrex — :this 
world’s counterpart — might just be 
here. 

So little on which to pin a quest! 
A ship which might or might not be 
now approaching Ty-Kry — and 
which would meet a drastic recep- 
tion when it landed. Suppose Kas 
— or his this-world’s double — 
were killed? Would that anchor her 
here for all time? Resolutely Tami- 
san pushed such negative specu- 
lation to the back of her mind. 
First things first; the ship had not 
yet planeted. But when it came she 
must make sure that she was among 
those who were preparing for its 
welcome. 



26 



IF 




Tt seemed that having made 
-*■ that decision she was at last 
able to sleep, for the fatigue which 
had struck at her in the hall re- 
turned a hundred-fold, and she fell, 
back on the couch as one drugged, 
remembering nothing more until she 
awakened to find the woman in 
green standing above her, one hand 
on her shoulder shaking her gently 
back to awareness, 

‘‘Awake — there is a summons.” 

A summons to dream, Tamisan 
thought dazedly, and then the un- 
familiar room, the immediate past 
came completely back to her. 

“The First Standing Jassa has 
summoned.” The woman sounded 
excited. “It is said by her messen- 
ger, and he has brought a chair 
cart for you, that you are to go to 
the High Castle I Perhaps you will 
see for the Over-Queen herself I But 
there is time — I have won it for 
you — to bathe, to eat, to change 
ybur robe. See — I have plundered 
my own bride chest — ”She pointed 
to a chair over which was spread a 
robe, not of the deep violet Tamisan 
now wore, but of a purple-wine. “It 
is the only one of the proper color 
— or near it.” She ran her hand 
lovingly over the rich folds. 

“But haste!” she added briskly. 
“As a Mouth you can claim the 
need for making ready to appear 
before high company, hut to linger 
too long will raise the anger of the 
First Standing.” 

There was a basin large enough 

28 



to serve as a bath in the room be- 
yond. And, as well as the robe, the 
woman brought fresh body linen. 
So that when Tamisan stood once 
more before the mirror to clasp her 
silver belt and assume the Mouth 
crown, she felt renewed and re- 
freshed and her thanks were warm. 

But the woman made a gesture 
of brushing them aside. “Are we 
not of the same clan, cousin-kin? 
Shall one say that Nahra is not 
open-handed with her own? That 
you are a Mouth is our clan pride, 
let us enjoy it through you!” 

She brought a covered bowl and 
a goblet and Tamisan ate a dish of 
mush-meal into which had been 
baked dried fruit and bits of what 
she thought well-chopped meat. 
It was tasty, and she finished it 
to the last crumb, just as she 
emptied the cup of a tart-sweet 
drink. 

“Well away, Tamisan, this is a 
great day for the clan of Fremont 
when you go to the High Castle 
and perhaps stand before the Over- 
Queen. May it be that the Seeing 
is not for ill, but for good. Though 
you are but the Mouth of Olava 
and not the One dealing fortune 
to us who live and die.” 

“For your aid and your good 
wishing, receive my thanks,” Tami- 
san said. “I, too, hope that fortune 
comes from misfortune on this 
day.” And that is stark truth, she 
thought, for I must gather fortune 
to me with both hands and hold it 

IF 




tight, lest the chancy game I play 
be lost. 

F irst Standing Jassa’s messenger 
was an officer, his hair club- 
bed up under a ridged helm to give 
additional protection to his head in 
battle, his breastplate enameled 
blue with the double crown of the 
Over-Queen, and his sword very 
much to the fore — as if he already 
strode the street of a city at war. 
There was a small grypon between 
the shafts of the chair cart and two 
men-at-arms ready, one at the gry- 
pon’s head, the other holding aside 
the curtains as their officer handed 
Tamisan into the chair. He brusk^ 
ly jerked the curtains shut without 
asking her pleasure, and she de- 
cided that perhaps her visit to the 
High Castle was to be a secret mat- 
ter. 

But between the curtain edges 
she caught sight of this Ty-Kry. 
And, though in parts it was very 
strange to her, there were enough 
similarities to provide her with an 
anchor to the real. The sky towers 
and other off-world forms of archi- 
tectures which had been introduced 
by space travelers were missing. 
But the streets themselves, the 
many beds of foliage and flowers, 
were those she had known all her 
life. 

And the High Castle — she drew 
a deep breath as they wound out of 
town and along the river — this — 
this had been part of her world. 



too, though then as a ruined and 
very ancient landmark. Part of it 
had been slagged in the war ef 
SylVs rebellion. And it had been 
considered a place of misfortune, 
largely shunn^, save for off-warld 
tourists seeking the unusual. 

But here it was in its pride, 
larger, more widely spread than in 
her Ty-Kry, as if the generations 
who had deserted it in her world 
had clung to it here, adding ever 
to its bulk. For it was not a single 
structure but a city in itself, though 
it had no merchants nor public 
buildings , but rather provided 
homes to shelter the nobles, who 
must spend part of the year at 
court, and all their , servants, and 
the many officials of the kingdom. 

In its heart was the building 
which gave it its name, a collection 
of towers, rising far above the les- 
ser structures at the foot. These 
were of a gray at their bases which 
changed subtly as they arose until 
their tops were a deep, rich blue, 
while the other buildings in the 
great pile were wholly gray as to 
wall, a darker blue as to roof. 

The chair creaked forward on its 
two wheels, the grypon being kept 
to a steady pace by the man at 
its head, and passed under the 
thick arch in the outer wall, then 
up a street between buildings which, 
though dwarfed by the towers, were 
in turn dwarfing to those who 
walked or rode by them. 

There was a second gate, more 



TOYS OF TAMISAN 



29 




buildings, a third, and then the open 
space about the central towers. They 
had passed people in plenty since 
entering the first gate. Many were 
soldiers of the guard, but some of 
the armed men had worn other 
colors and insignia, being, Tami- 
san guessed, the retainers of court 
lords. And now and then some 
Lord came proudly, his retinue 
strung along behind him by threes 
to make a show which amused 
Tamisan, as if the number of fol- 
lowers to tread on one’s heels en- 
hanced one’s importance in the 
world. 

She was handed down with a 
little more ceremony than she had' 
been ushered into the chair. And 
the officer offered her his wrist, his 
men falling in behind as a groom 
hurried forward to lead off the 
equipage, thus affording her a tail- 
of-honor too. 

But the towers of the High Castle 
were so awe inspiring, so huge a 
pile, she was glad she had an es- 
cort into their heart. The farther 
they went through halls — so high 
that it was hard to see their dusky 
roofs, ill lit by only the big candles 
in their man-tall holders — ^the more 
uneasy she became. As if once with- 
in his maze there might be no re- 
treat and she woiild be lost forever. 

VI 

T wice they climbed staircases un- 
til her legs ached with the effort 



and the stairs took on the aspect of 
mountains. Then her party passed 
into a long hall which was lighted 
not only by the candle-trees but 
some tMn rays filtering through 
windows placed so high above their 
heads that nothing could be seen 
through them. And Tamisan, in 
that part of her which seemed famil- 
iar with this world, knew this to be 
the Walk of the Nobles, and the 
company now gathered here were, 
nearest, the Third Standing, then 
the Second and, at the far end of 
that road of blue carpet onto which 
her guide led her. First Standing 
— or rather sitting, there being two 
arcs of hooded and canopied chairs, 
with a throne above them on a 
three-step dias. And the hood over 
that was upheld by a double crown 
which glittered with gems, while on 
the steps were grouped men in the 
armor of the guard and others 
wearing bright tunics, their hair 
loose upon their shoulders. 

It was toward that throne that 
the officer led her and they passed 
through the ranks of the Third 
Standing, hearing a low murmur of 
voices. Tamisan looked neither to 
right or left. She wished to see the 
Over-Queen, for it was plain she 
was being granted full audience. 
And then — something stirred deep 
within her as if a small pin pricked. 
The reason for this she did not 
know, save that ahead was some- 
thing of vast importance to her. 

Now they were equal with the 



30 



IF 




first of the chairs and she saw that 
the greater number of those who 
so sat were women, but not all. 
And mainly they were of an age 
to be at least in middle life. So 
Tamisan came to the foot of the 
dais, and in that moment she did 
not go to one knee as did the offi- 
cer, but rather raised her finger 
tips to touch the rim of the crown 
on her head. For with another of 
those flashes of half recognition, 
she knew that in this place that 
which she represented did not bow 
as did others, but acknowledged 
only that the Queen was one to 
whom human allegiance was grant- 
ed after another and greater loyal- 
ty was paid elsewhere. 

'^he Over-Queen looked down 
with as deeply searching a 
stare as Tamisan looked up. And 
what Tamisan saw was a woman 
to whom she could not set an age; 
rather she might be either old or 
young, for the years had not seem- 
ed to mark her. The robe on her 
full figure was not ornate, but a 
soft pearl color without ornamen- 
tation, save that she wore a girdle 
of silvery chains braided and woven 
together, and a collar-like necklace 
of the same metal from which 
fringed milky gems cut into drops. 
Her hair was a flame of brightly 
glowing red in which a diadem of 
the same creamy stones was al- 
most hidden. As for her face — was 
she beautiful? Tamisan could not 



have said. But that she was vitally 
alive there was no doubt Even 
though she sat so quietly bow, 
there was an aura of energy about 
her suggesting that this was only 
a pause between the doing of great 
and necessary deeds. To Taaiisan 
she was the most assertive person- 
ality she had ever seen and instant- 
ly the guards of a dreams went 
into action. To serve such a mis- 
tress, Tamisan thought, would sap 
all the personality from one, so 
that the servant would become but 
a mirror to reflect from that sur- 
render onward. 

‘‘Welcome, Mouth of Olava who 
has been uttering strange things.’' 
The Over-Queen’s voice was mock- 
ing, challenging. 

“A Mouth says naught. Great 
One, save what is given it to 
speak.” Tamisan found her answer 
ready, though she had not con- 
sciously formed it in her mind. 

“So we are told. Though Gods 
may grow ©Id and tired. Or is that 
only the fate of men? But now 
it is our will that Olava speak 
again — if that is fortune for this 
hour. So be it!” 

As if that last phrase was an or- 
der there was a stir among those 
standing on the steps of the throne. 
Two of the guardsmen brought out 
a table, a third a stool, the fourth 
a tray on which rested four bowls 
of sand. These they set up before 
the throne. 

Tamisan took her place on the 



TOYS OF TAMISAN 



31 




stool, again put her fingers to her 
ten^les. Would this work once 
more? Or must she try to force a 
picture in the sand? She felt a 
small shiver of nerves she fought 
to control. 

“What desires the Great One?” 
She was glad to hear her voice 
steady, no hint of her uneasiness 
in it. 

“What chances in — say four 
passages of the sun?” 

Tamisan waited. Would that 
other personality or power, or what- 
ever it might be, take over? But 
her hand did not move. Instead 
that odd, disturbing prick grew the 
stronger; she was drawn, even as 
a noose might be laid about her 
forehead to puU her head around. 
So she turned to follow the dic- 
tates of that pull, to look where 
something willed her eyes to look. 
But all she saw was the line of 
officers on the steps of the throne, 
and they stared at and through 
her, none with any sign of recog- 
nition StarrexI She grasped at 
that hope; but none of them re- 
sembled the man she sought. 

Olava sleep? Or has His 
Mouth been forgotten for a 

space?” 

The Over-Queen’s voice was 
sharper, and Tamisan broke that 
hold on her attention^ looked back 
to the throne and the woman on it. 

“It is not meet for the Mouth to 
speak unless Olava wishes — ” 



Tamisan began, with increasing 
nervousness until siie felt that sen- 
sation in her left hand, as if it were 
not under her control but possess- 
ed by another will. She fell silent 
as it gathered up the brownish 
sand and tossed it to form a pic- 
ture’s background. 

But this time she did not seek 
next the blue grains; rather her 
fist dug into the red and moved 
to paint in the outline of the space 
ship, above it a single red circle. 

Then there was a moment of 
hesitation, before her fingers stray- 
ed to the green, took up a generous 
pinch and again made Starrex’s 
S3mibol below the ship. 

“A single sun,” the Over-Queen 
read out. “One day until the ene- 
my comes. But what is the remain- 
ing word of Olava, Mouth?” 

“That there be one among you 
who is a key to victory. He shall 
stand against the enemy and under 
him fortune comes.” 

“So? And who is this hero?” 
Tamisan looked again to the line 
of officers. Dared she trust to in- 
stinct? Something within her urged 
her on. 

“Let each of these protectors of 
Ty-Kry — ” She raised a finger 
to indicate the officers. “Let each 
come forward and take up the sand 
of seeing. Let the Mouth touch 
that hand and may it then strew 
the answer — perhaps Olava will 
so make it clear.” 

To Tamisan’s surprise, the Over- 

IF 



32 




Queen laughed. good a way as 
any perhaps for picking a cham- 
pion. Though to abide by Olava’s 
choice — that is another matter.” 
And her smile faded as she glanced 
at the men, as if there was a 
thought in her mind which dis- 
turbed her. 

At her nod, they came one by 
one. Under the shadows of their 
helmets their faces, being of one 
race, were very similiar; and Tam- 
isan, studying each, could see no 
chance of telling which Starrex 
might be. 

Each took up a pinch of green 
sand, held out his hand palm down 
and let the grains fall while she set 
finger tip to the back of that hand. 
The sand drifted, but in no shape 
and to no purpose. 

Tt was not imtil the last man 
came that there was a differ- 
ence, for then the sand did not 
drift, but fell to form again the 
symbol which was twin to the one 
already on the table. Tamisan 
looked up. The officer was staring 
at the sand rather then meeting her 
eyes, and there was a line of strain 
about his mouth, a look about him 
such as might shadow the face of a 
man who stood with his back to a 
wall and a ring of sword points at 
his throat. 

‘This is your man,” Tamisan 
said. Starrex? She must be sure — 
if she could only demand the truth 
in this instant! 



But her preoccupation was swept 
aside. 

“Olava deals falsely!” That «ry 
came from the officer behind her, 
•the one who had brought her here. 

“Perhaps we must not think ill 
of Olava’s advice.” The Over- 
Queen’s voice had a guttural, fe- 
line purr. ‘Tt may be his Mouth 
is not wholly we^ed to his ser- 
vice, but speaks for others than 
Olava at times. Hawarel — so you 
are to be om champion — 

The officer went to one knee, his 
hands clasped loosely before him 
as if he v^ed all to see he did 
not reach for any weapon. 

“I am no choice, save the Great 
One’s.” In spite of the strain visi- 
ble in his tense body he spoke lev- 
elly and without a tremor. 

“Great One, this traitor — ” 
Two of the officers moved as if to 
lay hands upon him and drag him 
away. 

“No. Has not QIava spoken?” 
The mockery was very plain in the 
Over-Queen’s tone now. “But to 
make sure that Olava’s will be car- 
ried out, take good care of our 
champion - to - be. Since Haw- 
arel is to fight our battle with the 
cursed starmen, he must be saved 
to do it.” Now she looked to Tami- 
san, who was still startled by Ibe 
quick turn of events and their hos- 
tility to Olava’s choice. “Let the 
Mouth of Olava diare with Ha- 
warel this waiting that she may, per- 
haps instill in Olava’s choice the

33 




vigor and strength such a battle 
will demand of our chosen cham- 
pion/V Each time the Over-Queen 
spoke the last word she made of 
it a thing of derision and subtle 
menace. 

“The audience is finished.” The 
Over-Queen arose, stepped behind 
the throne as those about Tamisan 
fell to their knees; and then she 
was gone. But the officer who had 
guided Tamisan was by her side. 
And Hawarel, once more on his 
feet, was closely flanked by two of 
the other guards, one of whom 
pulled their prisoner’s sword from 
his sheath before he could move. 
With Hawarel before her, Tamisan 
was urged from the hall. 

At the moment she was pleased 
enough to go, hoping for a chance 
to prove the rightness of her guess, 
that Hawarel and Starrex were the 
same and she had found the first 
of her fellow dreamers — was this 
far onward toward their release. 

They traversed more halls until 
they came to a door which one of 
HawarePs guards opened. The pris- 
oner walked through and Tamisan’s 
escort waved her after him. Then 
the door slammed shut and at that 
sound Hawarel whirled around. 

Under the beaking fore plate of 
his helmet his eyes were cold fire 
and he seemed a man about to leap 
for his enemy’s throat. 

“Who — ” His voice was only a 
harsh whisper. “Who set you to my 
death wishing, witch?” 



VII 

TTis clawed hands were reaching 
for her throat. Tamisan flung 
up her arm in an attempt to guard, 
stumbled back. 

“Lord Starrex I” If she had been 
wrong — if — ! 

Though his finger tips brushed 
her shoulders, he did not grasp her. 
Instead it was his turn to retreat a 
step or two, his mouth half open 
in a gasp. 

“Witch — witch!” The very 
force of the words he hurled at her 
made them like darts dispatched 
from one of the archaic crossbows 
of the history tapes. 

“Lord Starrex,” Tamisan re- 
peated, feeling on more secure 
ground at seeing his stricken 
amazement, no longer- fearing he 
would attack her out of hand. His 
reaction to that name was enough 
to assure her she was right, though 
he did not seem prepared to ac- 
knowledge it. 

“I am Hawarel of the Vanora,” 
he brought out those words as 
harsh croaking. 

Tamisan glanced around. This 
was a bare-walled room, with no 
hiding place for a listener. In her 
own time and place she could have 
feared many scanning devices. But 
she thought those unknown to this 
Ty-Kry. And to win Hawarel-Star- 
rex into cooperation was very nec- 
essary. 

“You are Lord Starrex,” she re- 

IF 



34 




furned with bold confidence or at 
least what she hoped was .a con- 
vincing show of such. “Just as I 
am Tamisan, the dreamer. And 
this, wherein we are caught, is the 
dream you ordered of me.” 

He raised his hand to his fore- 
head, his fingers encountered his 
helmet, and he swept it off un- 
heedingly, so that^ it clanked and 
skidded across the polished floor. 
His hair, netted into a kind of pro- 
tecting cushion, was piled about 
his head, giving him an odd ap- 
pearance to Tamisan. It was black 
and thick, just as his skin was as 
brown-hued as that of her new 
body. And without the shadow of 
the helm she could see his face 
more clearly, finding in it no re- 
semblance to the aloof master of 
the sky towers. In a way, it was 
that of a younger man, one less 
certain of himself. 

“I am Hawarel,” he repeated 
doggedly. “You try to trap me, or 
perhaps the trap has already closed 
and you seek now to make me con- 
demn myself with my own mouth. 
I tell you, I am no traitor — I am 
Hawarel and my blood oath to the 
Great One h^ been faithfully 
kept.” 

^^amisan experienced a rise of 
^ impatience. She had not 
thought Lord Starre:: to be a stu- 
pid man. But it would seem his 
counterpart here lacked more than 
just the face of his other self. 



“You are Starrex, and this is 2 
dream.” If it was not, she did no1 
care to raise that issue now. “Re 
member the sky tower? You boughi 
me from Jabis for dreaming. Ther 
you summoned me — and Lore 
Kas — and ordered me to prove 
my worth.” 

His brows drew together in z 
black frown as he stared at her. 

“What have they given you oi 
promised, that you do to me?’ 
came his counter-demand. “I an: 
no sworn enemy to you or yours — 
not that I know.” 

Tamisan sighed. “Do you deny 
you know the name Starrex?” she 
asked. 

For a long moment he was si- 
lent. Then he turned from her. 
took a stride or two, his toe thump- 
ing against his helmet, sending it 
rolling ahead of him. She waited 
He rounded again to face her. 

“You are a Mouth of Olava — ’■ 

She shook her head, interrupting 
him. “We have little time for such 
fencing. Lord Starrex. You do know 
that name, and it is in my mind 
that you also remember the rest, 
at least in some measure. I am 
Tamisan the dreamer.” 

It was his turn to sigh. “So you 
say.” 

“So I shall continue to say. And, 
mayhap as I do, others than you 
will listen.” 

“As I thought!” he flashed. 
“You would have me betray my- 
self.”

“If you are truly Hawarel as 
you state, then what have you to 
betray?” 

“Very well. I am — am two! I 
am Hawarel and I am someone 
else who has queer memories and 
who may well be a night demon 
come to dispute ownership of this 
body. There — you have it! Go 
and tell those who sent you and 
have me out to the arrow range 
for a quick ending there. Perhaps 
that will be better than to con- 
tinue as a battle field between two 
different selves.” 

Perhaps he was not just being 
obstinate, Tamisan thought It 
might be that the dream had a 
greater hold on him than it did on 
her. After all she was a trained 
dreamer, one used to venturing in- 
to illusions wrought from imagina- 
tion. 

“If you can remember a little 
— then listen!” She drew closer to 
him and began to speak in a lower 
voice — not that she believed they 
could be overheard, but it was well 
to take no chances. Swiftly she 
gave her account of this whole mad 
tangle, or what had been her part 
in it. 

TT^hen she was done she was sur- 
prised to see that a certain 
hardening had overtaktti his fea- 
tures, so that now he looked more 
resolute, less like one trapped in a 
maze which had no guide. 

“And this is the truth?” 



“By what god or power do you 
wish me to swear to it?” She was 
exasperated now, frustrated by his 
lingering doubts. 

“None, because it explains what 
was heretofore imexplainable — 
what has made my life a hell of 
doubt these past hours and brought 
more suspicion upon me, I have 
been two persons. But if this is all 
a dream — why is that so?” 

“I do not knbw.” Tamisan chose 
frankness as best befitting her 
needs now. “This is unlike any 
dream I have created before.” 

“In what manner?” be asked 
crisply. 

“It is part of a dreamer’s duty 
to study her master’s personality, 
to suit his desires, even if tlM>se be 
unexpressed and hidden. From 
what I had learned of you — of 
Lord Starrex — I thought that to# 
much had been already seen, ex- 
perienced, known to you. That it 
must be a new approach I tried, 
or else you would find that dream- 
ing held no profit. 

“Therefore it came to me sud- 
denly that I would not dream of 
the past, nor of the future, which 
are the common approaches for an 
action dreamer, but refine upon the 
subject. In the past there were 
times in history when the future 
rested upon a single decision. And 
it was in my mind to select cer- 
tain of these decisions and then en- 
vision a world, co-existent with our 
own, in which those decisions had 



36 



IF 




golie in the opposite direction — 
trjing to see what would be the 
present-day result of actions in the 
past.” 

“And so this is what you tried? 
And what decisions did you select 
for your experiment at the rewrit- 
ting of history?” He was giving her 
his full attention now. 

“I took three. First, the Welcome 
of the Over-Queen Ahta; second 
the drift of the Colony ship Wan- 
derer; third, the rebellion of Sylt. 
Should the Welcome have been a 
rejection, should the colony ship 
never reached here, should Sylt 
have failed — these would produce 
a world I thought might be inter- 
esting to visit — in a dream. So I 
read what history tapes I could 
call upon. Thus, when you sum- 
moned me to dream I had my ideas 
ready. But — it did not work as it 
should have. Instead of spinning 
the proper dream, creating inci- 
dents in good order, I found my- 
self fast caught in a world I did 
not know, nor build.” 

As she spoke she watched the 
change in him. He had lost all the 
fervent antagonism of his first at- 
tack on her. More and more, she 
could see what she had associated 
with the personality of Lord Star- 
rex coming through the unfamiliar 
envelope of the guardsman’s body. 

“So it did not work properly — 

“No, as I have said, I found my- 
self in the dream, with no control 
of action, no recognizable creation 



factors. I do not understand — ” 

“No? There could be on explan- 
ation.” The frown line was back 
between his brows but it was not a 
scowl aimed at her; rather it was 
as if he were trying hard to re- 
member something of importance 
which eluded his efforts. “There is 
a theory, a very old one — Yes I 
That of Parallel worlds!” 

T n her wide use of the tapes 
j^e had not come across that 
and now she demanded the knowl- 
edge of him almost fiercely. “What 
are those?” 

“You are not the first — how 
could you be — to be struck by the 
notion that sometimes history and 
the future hang upon a very thin 
cord which can be twisted this way 
and that by small chance. There 
was a theory once advanced that 
when that chanced it created a sec- 
ond world, one in which the deci- 
sion was made to the right, when 
that of the world we know went to 
the left.” 

“But — alternated worlds — 
where — how did they exist?” 

“Thus, perhaps.” He held out 
his two hands horizontally one 
above the other. “In layers. There 
were even old tales, created for 
amusement, of men traveling, not 
back in time, nor forward, but 
across it from one such world to 
another.” 

“But — here we are. I am a 
Mouth of Olava, nor do I look like

myself. Just as to the eye you are 
not Lord Starrex — ” 

‘‘Perhaps we are the people we 
would be if our world had taken 
the other side of your three deci- 
sions* It is a clever device for a 
dreamer to create, Tamisan.” 
“Only,^’ she told him now the 
last truth, “I do not think I have 
created it. Certainly I can not con- 
trol it — ” 

“You have tried to break this 
dream?” 

“Of course I But I am tied here. 
I think by you and the Lord Kas. 
Until we three try together, per- 
haps we can not any of us return.” 
“And Kas — now you must go 
searching for him?” 

She shook her head. “Kas, I 
think, is one of the crew on this 
spacer about to set down. I believe 
I saw him — though not his face.” 
Now she smiled a little shakily. 
“It seems that though I am mainly 
the Tamisan I have always been, 
yet also do I have some of the 
powers of a Mouth. Just as you 
are Hawarel as well as Starrex.” 
“The longer I listen to you,” he 
announced, “the more I become 
Starrex. So we must find Kas on 
the spacer before we wrangle free 
from this tangle? But that is going 
to be rather a problem. I am 
enou^ of Hawarel to know that 
the spacer is going to receive the 
usual welcome dealt off-world ships 
here — trickery and extinction. 
Your three points have been as you 



envisioned them. There was no 
Welcome, but rather a massacre, no 
colony ship ever reached here, and 
Sylt was speared by a contemptu- 
ous man-at-arms the first time he 
lifted his voice to draw a crowd. 
Hawarel knows this as the truth; 
as Starrex I am aware there is an- 
other truth which did radically 
change life on this planet. Now, did 
you seek me out on purpose, your 
champion tale intended to be our 
bridge to Kas?” 

“No, at least I did not conscious- 
ly arrange it so. I tell you, I have 
some of the powers of a Mouth — 
they take over.” 

He gave a sharp bark of sound 
which was not laughter but some- 
what akin to it. “By the Fist of 
Jimsam Taragon, we have it “com- 
plicated by magic, tool And I sup- 
pose you can not tell me just how 
much a Mouth can do in the way 
of foreseeing or forearming or free- 
ing us from this trap?” 

Tamisan shook her head. “The 
Mouths were mentioned in the his- 
tory tapes; they were very impor- 
tant once. But after Sylt’s rebellion 
they were either killed or disap- 
peared. They were hunted by both 
sides and most of what we know 
about them is only legend. I can 
not tell you what I can do. Some- 
times something — perhaps it is 
the memory and knowledge of this 
body — takes over and then I do 
strange things. I neither will nor 
understand them.”

TTe crossed the room and pulled 
two stools from a far corner. 
^‘We might as well sit at ease and 
explore what we can of this world 
memories. It just might be that 
united we can learn more than 
when trying singly. The trouble is 
— ” He reached out a hand and 
mechanically she touched finger 
tips to the back of it in a oddly 
formal ceremony which was not 
part of her own knowledge. So he 
guided her to one of the stools and 
she was glad to sit down. 

“The trouble is,” he repeated as 
he dropped on the other stool, 
stretching cfut his long legs and 
tugging at his sword belt with that 
dangerously empty sheath, “that I 
was more than a little mixed up 
when I awoke, if you might call it 
that — in this body. So that my 
first reactions must have suggested 
mental imbalance to those I en- 
coimtered. Luckily the Hawarel 
part was in control soon enough to 
save me. But there is a second 
drawback to this identity — I am 
suspect as coming from a province 
where there has been a rebellion. 
In fact I am here in Ty-Kry as a 
distrusted hostage, rather than a 
member in good standing of the 
guard. I have not been able to ask 
questions, and all I have learned 
is in bits and pieces. The real Ha- 
warel is a quite uncomplicated and 
simple soldier who is hurt by the 



suspicion against him and quite 
fervently loyal to the crown. I won- 
der how Kas took his awakening. 
If he preserves any remnant of his 
real self, he ought to be well es- 
tablished by now.” 

Tamisan, surprised, asked a 
question to which she hoped he 
would give a true and open an- 
swer: “You do not like — you have 
reason to fear Lord Kas?” 

“Like? Fear?” She could see 
that thin shadow of Starrex over- 
laying Hawarel become more dis- 
tinct. “Those are emotions. I have 
had little to do with emotions for 
some time.” 

“But you wanted him to share 
the dream,” she persisted. 

“True. I may not be emotional 
about my esteemed cousin, but I 
am a prudent man. Since it was by 
his urging, in fact his arrangement, 
that you were added to my house- 
hold, I thought it only fair he 
share in his plan for my entertain- 
ment. I know that Kas is very so- 
licitous of his crippled cousin, 
ready-handed to serve in any way 
— so generous of time, energy — ” 
“You suspect him of something?” 
She thought she had sensed what 
lay behind his words. 

“Suspect? Of what? He has 
been, as all would assure you free- 
ly, and as far as I would allow, my 
good friend.” But there was a 
closed look about him, warning her 
off from any further exploration of 
that 



40 



IF 




crippled cousin.” This time 
Hawarel repeated those words as if 
he spoke to himself and not to her. 
‘‘At least you have done me a small 
service on the credit side of the 
scale.” Now he did look to Tami- 
san as he thumped his right leg 
with a satisfaction which was not 
of the Starrex she knew. “You 
have provided me with a body in 
good working order. Which I may 
well need, since so far bad has out- 
weighed the good in this world.” 

4 C T T awarel — Lord Starrex — ” 
^ she was beginning when he 
interrupted her. 

“Give me always Hawarel. Re- 
member! There is no need to add 
to the already heavy load of sus- 
picion surrounding me in these 
halls.” 

“Hawarel, then. I did not choose 
you for the champion; that was 
done by that power I do not under- 
stand, working through me. If they 
agree — then you have a good 
chance to find Kas. You may even 
demand that he be the one you 
battle.” 

“Find him how?” 

“They may allow me to select 
the proper one from the off-world 
force,” she suggested.^ A very thin 
thread on which to hang any plan 
of escape, but she could not see a 
better one. 

“And you think that this sand 
painting will pick him out — as it 
did me?” 



“But it did you, did it not?” 
“That I can not deny.” 

“And the first time I foresaw — 
for one of the First Standing — it 
made such an impression on her 
that she had me summoned here 
to foresee for the Over-Queen.” 
“Magic!” Again he uttered that 
half laugh. 

“To another worlder, much that 
the space travelers can do might 
be termed magic.” 

“Well enough. I have seen things 

— yes, I have seen things myself, 
and not while dreaming either. 
Very well, I am to volunteer to 
meet an enemy champion from the 
ship and then you sand paint out 
the proper one. If you are success- 
ful and do find Kas — then 
what?” 

“It is simple — we wake.” 

“You take us with you, of 
course?” 

“If we are so linked that we can 
not leave here without one another 

— then a single waking will take 
us all.” 

“Are you sure you need Kas? 
After all, I was the one you were 
planning this dream for.” 

“We go, leave the Lord Kas 
here?” 

“A cowardly withdrawal you 
think, my dreamer. But one, I as- 
sure you which would solve many 
things. However — can you send 
me through, return for Kas? It is 
in my mind I would like to know 
what is happening now for myself

— in our own world. Is it not by 
the dreamer’s oath that he for- 
whom the dream is wrought has 
first call upon the dreamer?” 

So he did have some lurking im- 
easiness tied to KasI But in a man- 
ner he was right. She reached out 
before he was aware of what she 
would do and seized his hand, at 
the same time using the formula 
for waking. Once more that mist 
which was nowhere enveloped her. 
But it was no use; her first guess 
had been right — they were still 
tied. And she blinked her eyes open 
upon the same room. Hawarel had 
slumped, was falling from his stool 
so that she had to go to one knee 
to support his body with her shoul- 
der or he would have slid full 
length to the floor. Then his mus- 
cles tightened and he jerked erect, 
his eyes open and blazing into hers 
with the same cold anger with 
which he had first greeted her up- 
on entering this room. 

“Why — ?” 

“You asked,” she countered. 

T Tis lids drooped so she could no 
^ ^ longer see that icy anger. ‘‘So 
I did. But I did not quite expect 
to be so quickly served. Now, you 
have effectively proven your point 

— three go or none. And it remains 
to be seen how soon we can find 
our missing third.” 

He asked her no more questions 
and she was glad, since that whirl 
into nowhere in the abortive at- 



tempt at waking had tired her 
greatly. She moved the stool a little 
so her back could rest against the 
wall and she was farther from him. 
But in a little while he got to his 
feet and paced back and forth as 
if some driving desire for wider ac- 
tion worked in him, to the point 
where he cold not sit still. 

Once the door opened, but they 
were not summoned forth. Instead 
food and drink were brou^t to 
them by one of the guards, the 
other standing ready with a crossr 
bow at thigh, his eyes ever upon 
them. 

“We are well served. Hawarel 
opened the lids of bowls and in- 
spected their contents. “It would 
seem we are of importance. Hail, 
Rugaard, when do we go forth 
from this room, of which I am grow- 
ing very tired?” 

“Be at peace, you shall have ac- 
tion enough when the Great One 
desires it,” the officers by the cross- 
bowman answered. “The ship from 
the stars has been sighted, the 
moimtain beacons have blazed 
twice. They seem to be aiming for 
the plain beyond Ty-Kry. It is odd 
that they are so single-minded and 
come to the same pen to be taken 
each time. Perhaps Dalskol was 
ri^t when he said that they do 
not think for themselves at all, but 
carry out the orders of an off-world 
power which does not allow them 
independent judgment. Your ser- 
vice time will come. And, Mouth 



42 



IF 




of Olava — ” He took a step for- 
ward to see Tamisan the better. 
‘‘The Great One says that it might 
be well to read the sand on your 
own behalf. For false seers are 
given to those they have belittled in 
such seeing, to be done with as 
those they have so shamed may de- 
cide.” 

“As is well known,” she answer- 
ed him. “I have not dealt falsely, 
as shall be seen at the proper time 
and in the proper place.” 

When they were gone she was 
hungry, and so it seemed was Haw- 
arel, for they divided fairly and 
left nothing in the bowls. When 
they were done he said, “Since you 
are a reader of history and know 
old customs, perhaps you remem- 
ber one which it is not too pleasant 
to recall now — that among some 
races it was the proper thing to 
dine well a prisoner about to die.” 

“You choose a heartening thing 
to think onl” 

“No, you choose it, for this is 
your world, remember that, my 
dreamer.” 

'^amisan closed her eyes and 
' leaned her head and shoulders 
back against the wall. Perhaps she 
even slept a little, for there was 
the clang of sudden noise and she 
gasped out of a doze. The room 
had grown dark, but at the door 
was a blaze of light and in that 
stood the officer, behind a guard 
of spearmen. 



“The time has come,” he smd. 

“The wait has been long.” Ha- 
warel stood up, stretching wide his 
arms as one who has been ready 
for too long. Then he turned to 
her and once more offered his 
wrist. She would have liked to have 
done without his aid, but she found 
herself stiff and cramped enough 
to be ^ad of it. 

They went on a complicated way 
through halls, down stairs until at 
last they issued out into the night. 
And awaiting them was a covered 
cart much larger than the chair on 
wheels which had brought her. to 
the castle, this one with two gry- 
pons between its shafts. 

Into this their guard urged them, 
drawing the curtains, pegging those 
down tightly outside, so that even 
had they wished they could not 
and looked out. And as the cart 
creaked out, Tamisan tried to guess 
by sound where they might be go- 
ing. 

There was little noise to guide 
her. It was as if they now passed 
through a town deep in slumber. 
But in the gloom of the cart she 
felt rather than saw movement, and 
then a shoulder brushed hers and a 
whisper so faint she had to strain 
to hear it was at her ear. 

“Out of the castle — ” 

“Where?” 

“My guess is the field — the for- 
bidden place — ” 

The memory of the this-world 
Tamisan supplied explanation.

That was where two other spacers 
had planeted — not to rise again. 
In fact, the one which had come 
fifty years ago had never been dis- 
mantled but stood, a corroded mass 
of metal, to be a double warning 
— to the stars not to invade, to 
Ty-Kry to be alert against such 
invasion. 

It seemed to Tamisan that their 
ride would never come to an end. 
Then there was an abrupt halt 
which bumped her soundly against 
the side of the cart, and lights be- 
dazzled her eyes as the end cur- 
tains were pulled aside. 

C4^ome, Champion and Cham- 
^ pion-maker!” 

Hawarel obeyed first and turned 
to give her assistance once more; 
but he was elbowed aside as the 
officer pulled rather than led her 
into the open. Torches in the hands 
of spearmen ringed them around. 
Beyond was a colorful mass of peo- 
ple, with a double rank of guards 
drawn up as a barrier between 
those and the dark of the land be- 
yond. 

“Up there — ” Hawarel was be- 
side her again. 

Tamisan raised her eyes, almost 
blinded by the glare as a sudden 
pillar of fire burst across the night 
sky. A spacer was riding down on 
tail rockets to make a fin landing.

Starbright 

by E. G. VON WALD 



The gems were worth a king^s 
ransom . and anybod/s life I 



I t was a perfect sphere, about ten 
millimeters in diameter, and it 
^owed like a tiny, cold blue star. 

The old man at the bourse table 
nodded, smiling in appreciation. 

With his hand, he shaded it from 
the lights of the bright exhibition hah, 
and the blue glow diminished. As the 
shadow cast by his hand became 
darker, the stone became dull, neu- 
tral, gray, lifeless-looking. 

He nodded again and pronounced 
the word “perfect” with a certain 
reverence. Then, with evident re- 
gret, he replaced it in its case, closed 
the case and handed it back to its 
owner. 

“Sean Macnessa, you old jewel 



thief,” he said in mock severity. 
“That is as fine a blue as I have 
ever seen,” 

Macnessa acknowledged the com- 
pliment with a pleased nod. “1 trad- 
ed five Centauran filigrees for that 
blue,” he said. “Four of them were 
flawless.” 

They were old friends, these two, 
although they had not seen each other 
in years. It was natural that Mac- 
nessa, upon arriving at the gem col- 
lectors’ convention, should go first 
to the booth of the dd Centaumn, 
Ommaley. If there were anything 
truly excellent available in the Alde- 
baran system, Ommal^ would know. 

Ihe noise of the crowd of cc^c- 



45 




tors, traders and dealers was muted 
by the walls of the booth. That was 
one of the reasons for having booths. 
A certain privacy and quiet was 
deemed appropriate for the viewing 
of fine gems. 

“So it’s starbrights that you are 
after now,” Ommaley said thought- 
fully, his old gray eyes gazing quiz- 
zically at Macnessa. “A pity. I doubt 
if you will find any here.” 

Macnessa frowned. “I was given 
to understand that there were several 
reds in the Aldebaran region.” 

“For two months I have been 
here,” Ommaley said, “preparing for 
this convention. I have yet to see 
even a black offered for sale.” 

“How can this be possible? My 
informant is like you, and rarely in 
error when it comes to fine gems.” 

O mmaley shrugged. “I have heard 
that as recently as a year ago, 
seven starbrights existed in Aldebaran 
dealers’ stocks or in private hands. 
A blue — not as fine as yours — 
two yellows, a green and two reds. 
One of the reds is reputed to be a 
blood red and flawless, and readily 
excited to its characteristic radiation 
by even dim white light.” 

“What happened to them?” 
“Gone. Disappeared. Nobody 
seems to know where. Of course, 
you know gem dealers. If something 
is available, it is not at all difficult to 
find out about it. Once it has been 
disposed of, discretion is the rule. It 
is good business as well as good 
ethics.” 

“But these are starbrights,” Mac- 
nessa insisted. “An ordinary gem — 
yes, these can disappear. Even a Cen- 



tauran filigree. But not starbrights. 
They are too rare and valuable.” He 
paused and considered. 

“If they were available,” he de- 
cided, “but have been disposed of, 
then perhaps they could be made 
available again for a suitable trade. 
Unless — ” He raised his eyebrows 
questioningly. 

Ommaley shook his head. 

“The peculiar political institutions 
of Aldebaran admit of considerable 
activity which we of Centaur would 
consider lawless, even brigandage. But 
I have heard of no gem traders in- 
volved in any such activity.” 

“I didn’t really expect that,” Mac- 
nessa admitted. “Gem traders gen- 
erally know how to stay out of trou- 
ble.” 

“Exactly. Now your other point. 
You reason that if some local collec- 
tor obtained them, he might be will- 
ing to trade them for something you 
might have. I’m afraid this is unlike- 
ly. Most Aldebarans, bless their os- 
tentatious little souls, take great de- 
light in display. None has shown 
off the starbrights.” 

“You mean they have been traded 
out of the system?” 

Ommaley frowned thoughtfully, 
cocking his head to one side. “That 
part of it can be considered odd. If 
they had been traded, one would ex- 
pect to see the equivalent value in 
other gems suddenly becoming avail- 
able. But the better stones at this 
bourse today have pedigrees a meter 
long, and t^re is nothing irregular, 
or even sudden, in their recent his- 
tory. 

“On the other hand, although truly 
fine starbrights are not often sold, it 



46 



IF 




is possible. But even the usual broker- 
age commissiQn for handling the 
transaction would be very large. I 
have heard of no dealers who have 
come into sudden wealth lately.” 
“Then what is your conclusion, 
old friend?” 

T he old man threw up his hands. 

“I have none to give you. The 
starbrights are gone.” 

“I cannot quite believe this,” Mac- 
nessa insisted. “An old Centaurah 
like you being at a loss for informa- 
tion about the gems of his adopted 
I^anetary system!” 

“I am but a poor dealer,” Om- 
maley said, with every evidence of 
humility except the twinkle in his 
eyes. “And what about a young Cen- 
tauran like yourself, Sean?” 

“A not-so-young Centauran like 
myself has the good sense to be re- 
spectful of his elders, particularly 
those of the old sod of Brave Cen- 
taurus.” 

“You wrong me,” Ommaley said 
quickly. “I would do you no harm, 
!^n. If I could honestly help you, 
you know that I would.” 

Macnessa smiled and said, “Of 
course. But you admit that there is 
a possibility that the starbrights are 
still in Aldebaran?” 

“I admit nothing. If you wish to 
so conclude, that is no affair of 
mine.” 

“I see.” Macnessa pursed his lips. 
Abruptly he changed the subject. 
‘Tell me about the native customs, 
old friend. I understand that they 
have ‘warlords’ here.” 

“It is true. There is a confedera- 
tion of planets, but it is as loose as 



the confederation of the states on 
the planets. Here on IV, power is 
concentrated in the hands ct seven 
families. 

“A hundred years ago the number 
of local chieftains was much larger, 
but through war and marriage this 
has been reduced to the present stale- 
mate.” 

“There is much wealth?” 

“Oh, yes. Gem collectors’ conven- 
tions are not held in poor systems.” 
“I mean, could these warlords 
easily afford material in the star- 
bright class?” 

Ommaley smiled and shrugged. “If 
you want to know the common gos- 
sip, I can give you the common 
gossip. Certainly, any of them could 
to buy up one or two starbrights 
without straining their resources. Pos- 
sibly all seven of them.” 

“Are they cdlectors?” 

‘To some extent Nobody has a 
truly great collection, though, except 
the family Brandt. Theirs is hered- 
itary. I ^ve been told of no re- 
cent acquisitions. Lord Hauken has 
lately shown a greater interest than 
usual. He has a large harem. It is 
said that he would welcome a star- 
bright, or possibly a particularly fine 
filigree of our homeland.” 

“He sounds like a man of taste.” 
“Hauken’s taste runs more to poli- 
tical power. He and the Family 
Brandt are closely matched, and it 
is said that they are currently en- 
gaged in some political struggle. The 
Princess Brandt has recently disap- 
peared, some say kidnapped, and as 
a result her mother has taken to the 
black garb of mourning.” 

“A kidnapped princess,” said Mac- 



STARBRIGHT 



47 




nessa. “How quaint! Is she beauti- 
ful?” 

“She is. She is also very young, 
although marriageable by local cus- 
tom.” 

Ommaley suddenly appeared wor- 
ried. “My advice to you, old friend, 
is to be very careful if you 
are thinking of getting involved in 
local politics. They play for keeps in 
Aldebaran.” 

“Politics is always for keeps,” said 
Macnessa. “And I am always care- 
ful. Tell me something about this 
Hauken,” 

Ommaley glanced around, then 
lowered his voice. “Hauken is am- 
bitious, clever, and extremely power- 
ful and absolutely ruthless. The only 
real indication ^at he might have 
kidnapped the Princess Brandt is 
that nothing has been done about her 
disappearance. Only he could go un- 
challenged by the Brandt clan. Even 
so, there will be blood spilled before 
long, I think.” 

“Intriguing,” murmured Macnessa. 
“A man with a captive princess, great 
wealth, and who now seeks a star- 
bright.” 

“There are none available,” said 
Ommaley soberly. “Unless you care 
to dispose of yours.” 

“I have a small stock of duplicates 
from my collection,” admitted Mac- 
nessa. 

“The blue?” Ommaley seemed 
slightly apprehensive. 

“The blue is not available. That is 
to become part of my collection. And 
the other items I have are available 
only in trade for the gem I seek.” 

“I doubt if Lord Hauken has any- 
thing to interest you.” 



M acnessa left his friend paid 
courtesy visits to several ofi 
the other defers at the bourse. He 
was quite well known as a collector 
and trader. Those who had not met 
him personally knew him by reputa- 
tion. Discreet inquiries about star- 
brights brought 'nothing but puzzled 
confessions of ignorance. 

The following morning, a messen- 
ger delivered an invitation. Macnessa 
studied it carefully. He was not very 
surprised to receive it. He had made 
no secret about possessing some of 
the fabulous starbrights. The invita- 
tion was large, ornate and carried all 
the trappings of a wealthy but medi- 
eval political culture. There was an 
elaborate coat of arms, surrounded 
by cartouches of subordinate divisions 
of territory. i 

In a stately script, the missive ad- 
vised him that His Eminence, Lord 
Hauken of IV requested the honor of 
his company that afternoon. 

The messenger who brought it was 
almost as ornately got up as the invi- 
tation. Unfortunately, he knew noth- 
ing, or would admit to knowing noth-< 
ing. 

Again, Macnessa sought his friend 
at the bourse. 

“I know better than to warn you,” 
Ommaley said. “But this is dangerous. 
Lord Hauken will stop at nothing 
if he really wants your starbrights.” 

“I have been in dangerous situations 
before.” 

“Your luck and your ingenuity are 
well known,” Ommaley admitted. 
“But my advice is to take the first 
ship out and don’t come back. 
Both you and Hauken seek the same 
thing.” 



48 



IF 




L ord Hauken was a man of medi- 
um height, powerful of build al- 
though somewhat given over to fat, 
with curly dark hair. His eyes were 
expressionless, but his manner was 
affable. 

“Welcome to my humble abode,” 
he said, indicating the huge palace 
with an expansive wave of his arm. 
“It was brought to my attention that 
you honored our system with your 
presencQ^ and all know of your emi- 
nence in the study of gems.” 

“You flatter me, my lord Hauken,” 
replied Macnessa. “I have a fondness 
for beautiful things. Gems are beauti- 
ful. Therefore, I occasionally acquire 
one.” 

“Indeed,” Hauken said. “Perhaps 
you would honor me by viewing my 
collection.” 

“It would be a pleasure,” said 
Macnessa. 

Hauken carelessly waved, and a 
small platoon of servants approached 
with hand carriages. He and Mac- 
nessa each entered a carriage and 
were lifted to the servants’ shoulders. 

“There are those,” he said, “who 
prefer mechanical conveyances, but I 
have always preferred to use humans. 
Somehow it does something for my 
soul.” 

They proceeded along huge, bril- 
liantly lighted corridors, down broad 
and sweeping staircases, until finally 
they came to a secluded section, lux- 
uriously planted with all manner of 
exotic vegetation. A pool gleamed in 
the late afternoon sunlight. 

After assisting them out of the car- 
riages, the husky servants vanished, 
to be replaced by others of a more 
delicate character. 



“Few people are permitted in this 
section,” Lord Hauken said wiUh a 
smile. “It is my private retreat.” 

“It is delightful,” said Macnessa. 
They seated themselves in soft 
chairs beside the pool. Refreshments 
were brought. 

“And now allow me to display 
some of my poor baubles,” Lord 
Hauken said, and nodded a signaL 
At once a young, dark-haired girl 
appeared from behind a screen ef 
shrubbery. She walked calmly toward 
the two of them, and Macnessa be- 
came' aware that something seemed to 
be missing. It was her clothes. With a 
smile, she bowed to the ground be- 
fore them and held up her hands, 
which were covered with rings and 
wristlets set with brilliant jewels. Af- 
ter a suitable pause, she departed. 

She was followed by a blonde, 
quite statuesquely roun^d, wearing 
nothing but the green and red fire- 
stones native to Aldebaran I. Mac- 
nessa was pleased at the way they 
complemented her color, ahhough 
they were not of the best quality. 

The third was dark, small and elf- 
in. Hardly more than a child, she 
bore herself like a queen. Her jewelry 
was metallic and massive-looking, 
contrasting pleasantly with her sBght 
frame. 

Lord Hauken said, “You can see 
why I rarely exhibit my coIlectioiL 
The special settings are suited only 
for the connoisseur.” 

“Beyond doubt,” murmured Mac- 
nessa. 

“You will find the gems attractive? 
Perhaps you would like to examine 
them more closely.” 

Hauken signaled, and the next girl. 



STARBRIGHT 



49 




after bowing to her lord, sat in Mac- 
nessa’s lap. Her gem was a large fili- 
gree-and-emerald, suspended a few 
inches below her throat by an almost 
invisible metallic thread. Macnessa 
smiled at her and was rewarded by a 
raised eyebrow and ]ust the hint of a 
dimple in her cheek. 

He admitted, in response to Hau- 
ken’s question, that it was a most at- 
tractive setting for a filigree-and-em- 
erald. 

“I take keen delight in my 
jewels,” Hauken said, dismissing her. 
Then he assumed a melancholy atti- 
tude. “Unfortunately, the collection is 
meager.” 

“But pleasant,” said Macnessa. 
“Possibly. But I am sure that in 
your varied travels you have seen 
much better. Tell me, what would you 
say is the finest gem in the galaxy?” 
“This would depend upon the lo- 
cality and the species of being mak- 
ing the evaluation. However, I be- 
lieve that most would agree that the 
stone called ‘starbright* might claim 
that title.” 

CC^^h, yes,” said Hauken with 
^^stuied casualness. “I have 
heard of that one. It glows all by it- 
self, I understand, like a phosphor.” 
“Only in a certain sense,” Macnes- 
sa replied. “The starbright does re- 
semble a phosphor in that it can ab- 
sorb light at one wavelength and emit 
light at another. But there the re- 
semblance ends. For one thing, the 
starbright exhibits far greater purity 
of color. For another, starbright radi- 
atin is very nearly coherent, which 
accounts for its brilliance. As a mat- 
ter of fact, they make excellent lasers 



with only the most primitive of op- 
tical systems, and using only the am- 
bient room illumination for excita- 
tion.” 

“I see,” said Hauken. 

“There is another interesting point. 
A starbright will emit its character- 
istic glow only if it is excited by light 
of a shorter wavelength. For this rea- 
son, the blue is usually dimmer in 
white light than, say, the red. A 
black, on the other hand — so-called 
because its characteristic radiation is 
infrared and therefore invisible — 
can convert the entire visible spec- 
trum. Even a very tiny black always 
provides a pleasant sense of warmth. 
Large ones are used in industry.” 

“Fascinating,” said Lord Hauken. 
“Where do you suppose such mar- 
velous gems might be obtained?” 

Macnessa shrugged. “This is diffi- 
cult to say. I understood that some 
fine reds would be available in Alde- 
baran. Unfortunately, I have not been 
able to locate any.” He watched his 
host attentively, but could read noth- 
ing. 

More refreshments were brought. 
Lord Hauken, having completed his 
display of jewelry, caused a small 
string orchestra to be assembled. It 
consisted of similarly lovely women, 
all of whom were similarly under- 
dressed. Macnessa observed that they 
played with great skill. 

Finally Lord Hauken came to the 
point. “I cannot help you with the 
red starbright. On the contrary, I, 
myself, am looking for a starbright 
of any color. 1 am told that you own 
one.” 

“This is true.” 

“Then I will buy them from you.” 



50 



IF 




“I regret to say that this is impos- 
sible. The only way 1 could obtain 
the red that 1 want would be as a 
trade rather than a purchase. Such 
stones as I can spare from my col- 
lection constitute the currency for 
that trmisaction.” 

“I will buy your entire collection,” 
insisted Hauken. 

“I never sell my collections — 
whether gems, coins or any of the 
other items which I have collected 
from time to time.” 

“That is indeed regrettable,” Hau- 
ken said. With a wave of his hand 
he banished the all-houri orchestra. 
The court became very still. 

“You are sure you won’t change 
your mind?” he went on. “I can pay 
you well.” 

“It is out of the question.” 

“What a shame,” said Hauken. “I 
had hoped to do business with you. 
If you won’t do business, though, 
then I must accomplish my objective 
by other means.” 

Macnessa stood up. “I am not sure 
I understand,” he said. 

“It is simplicity itelf,” replied Hau- 
ken with a heavy-lipped smile. “You 
will be my guest until such time 
that you agree to part with your 
pretties.” The smile widened. “Natu- 
rally, although I am patient, my time 
is limited. I shall have your quarters 
searched. If the gems are not found, 
it may be necessary to use some more 
potent persuasion on you.” 

“You mean I am a prisoner?” 
“Certainly notl You are a valued 
guest. Your quarters will be com- 
fortable. I have another guest, whose 
quarters will adjoin yours. I am sure 
you will be well entertained, since 



the other guest is extremely talkative 
— a characteristic which I am sure 
will be cured in due time.” 

He snapped his fingers. “Guards!” 
A brace of husky, well-armed men 
appeared within ten seconds. 

“Take the gentleman to the special 
guest rooms. His suite shall adjoin 
that of the Princess Brandt.” 

M acnessa allowed himself to be led 
away. While carefully observing 
the route they took through the elab- 
orate palace, he tried to engage his 
guards in conversation. The effort 
was unrewarding. 

They went down corridors, down 
stairways and down elevators. Mac- 
nessa estimated that they must be at 
least fifty meters below the surround- 
ing surface level when they stopped. 

It was a very large room, done en- 
tirely in white with curious pieces of 
covered apparatus set in the floor at 
various places. When he attempted 
to examine one of them, he was 
stopped. The guards told him gruff- 
ly that he would find out all about 
them in time. The idea seemed to 
amuse them. 

They stripped him, examined him 
and his clothes and confiscated his 
money, pins, ocular cases and sundry 
minor items. Then they allowed him 
to dress again. After this, one of them 
drew back a curtain along the wall, 
which proved to have covered a 
barred door. 

T he first thing that Macnessa did 
when the guards left was to 
examine his spacious cell. There was 
a comfortable chair, a soft bunk, a 
table, a food dispenser and an alcove 



STARBRIGHT 



51 




equipped with various plumbing fix- 
tures. Considered as a prison cell, it 
was quite comfortable indeed 

The decor left somethiDg to be de- 
sired, as sterile white was not Mac- 
riessa’s favorite motive. He noted that 
the heating system was typical of the 
planet, being of the faceted radiant 
variety. Such systems consisted of 
close-spaced electric heating junc- 
tions, each faced with a small plastic 
lens; they provided an excellent distri- 
bution of radiant heat. 

Several minutes later, while he was 
examining the food dispenser mech- 
anism to see if it had any useful and 
detachable parts, he heard the words, 
“Oh dear.” 

He glanced around. A broad grill 
panel separated him from another 
room. There had been a white cur- 
tain across it when he entered, but 
this was now drawn back. 

“I hope I didn’t disturb you,” the 
girl said. 

“Ah,” said Macnessa gallantly, 
“the Princess Brandt.” 

She appeared quite blonde and 
beautiful and also, as Ommaley had 
suggested, quite young. She was 
dressed in a pale green frock. 

“I can’t really say I am sorry you 
are here, sir,” she said. “Actually I’m 
dying to have somebody to talk to.” 
“No doubt,” agreed Macnessa. He 
approached the grill and examined 
it. It was quite securely fastened. 

“Everything is locked up tight,” 
she told him. “You can’t get out 
when you want to, and you can’t get in 
when you want to, either. But tell me 
who you are, sir?” 

“My name is Sean Macnessa, Cen- 
tauran by birth,” he said proudly. 



“My name is Tintinetta,” the girl 
said, “but my friends call me Lulu.” 

“I see,” murmured Macnessa. PW 
a princess, she did not seem parBcu- 
larly haughty. 

“May I call you Sean?” 

“By all means.” 

“Good. Sit down, Sean, and we can 
get better acquainted.” 

Macnessa did so. “I understand 
you have been captive for some 
time.” 

“Nearly a month. It isn’t so bad, 
except I don’t have anybody to talk 
to except the guards, and they don’t 
like to stand and chat. Maybe they 
aren’t supposed to. And anyway, a 
princess really isn’t supposed to be 
too familiar with the help, you know. 
It seems odd, but that’s the way it has 
to be done.” 

“Are you permitted to contact your 
family,” asked Macnessa, “or perhaps 
a lawyer?” 

“I’m sure I wouldn’t know what to 
do with a lawyer if I had one, and 
nobody expects visitors or letters 
when one is kidnapped. It seems to 
be against the rules. Do you know 
why?” 

M acnessa sought for a reasonable- 
sounding reply. “Well,” he 
said, “perhaps your kidnapper wants 
to keep it all a secret.” 

“Oh dear no. Everybody knows 
I’m kidnapped and they know who 
did it — that terrible I^rd Hauken. 
They might not know exactly where 
I am being kept, of course.” She 
hesitated momentarily and added, 
“But then, I don’t know either.” 

“I believe — ” Macnessa started 
to explain that she was in the Palace .

IF 




Hauken, but she seemed already to 
have lost interest in that topic. 

“Did you say you were a Centau- 
ran?Does that mean you are in the 
jewelry business. Are all Centaurans 
in the jewelry business?” 

Macnessa explained, “In times past, 
there was a great abundance of pre- 
cious stones on the planets of Cen- 
taurus. This has made it a sort of 
ethnic calling. 1 myself make it a 
hobby — and occasionally a business 
— to collect rare and beautiful things 
of all sorts.” 

“Gem stones?” 

“Yes.” 

“I see,” replied Lulu. “Why did 
Lord Hauken kidnap you? Did you 
cheat him? I hope you did. I don’t 
like him.” 

“I do not cheat,” Macnessa said 
with irritation. “I have never foimd 
it necessary.” 

“But there must be some reason 
why he kidnapped you.” 

“Why did he kidnap you Prin- 
cess?” 

“He wants to marry me, of 
course.” 

“Ah,” said Macnessa. 

“Ah what?” she demanded, sud- 
denly angry. “I don’t want to marry 
him.” 

“Does Hauken think that keeping 
you here will change your mind about 
that?” 

“Of course not. He knows better 
than that. But if he has me here, 
then nobody else can marry me.” 
“There is somebody else, then?” 
“Oh of course. Lots of boys want 
to marry me.” She added with an 
impudent smile, “Wouldn’t you?” 
“If the circumstances were suit- 



able, I could think of nothing I 
should like better.” 

“You are very good at making 
pretty speeches. Are all Centaurans 
like that?” 

“It is sometimes said to be a he- 
reditary trait,” Macnessa admitted. 

“I Imow,” she said. 

“You do?” Macnessa was having 
some difficulty in following her con- 
versation. 

“Yes. The Lord Hauken wants to 
steal your jewelry.” She frowned 
slightly and said, “In that case, you 
must carry some extremely valuable 
jewelry. Lord Hauken would never 
waste his time otherwise. He would 
— oh!” Her voice caught. “Now I 
understand. You must have some 
starbrights.” 

M acnessa was astonished. The 
combination of little girl chat- 
ter and quick analysis was a little 
disconcerting. He admitted that he 
had some starbrights and asked her 
how she guessed. 

“It was easy. You see in my family 
we have had a custom for many gen- 
erations. Any important princess like 
me must be given a wedding present 
of the finest jewelry available. Not 
many people know the custom has 
become an obligation, so that if some- 
body can produce jewelry that is 
truly the finest, then the wedding is 
almost automatic.” 

“So that is why Hauken wants the 
starbrights.” 

She nodded. “My father is all up- 
set about this, too. He and Lord 
Hauken are enemies. Lord Hauken 
wants to make a lot of changes in 
the government, and my father says 



STARBRIGHT 



53 




that the changes would make virtual 
slaves out of all the people. Only, if 
Lord Hauken is married to me, then 
my father will have to compromise 
with him.” 

“So now Hauken holds you as a 
hostage.” 

“Hostage? You mean, he might 
harm me if my father di^’t give in? 
Of course not! Lord Hauken is a ty- 
rant and mean and terrible, but he 
certainly is a gentleman. My father is 
simply worried that Lord Hauken 
might force a marriage with me by 
getting hold of some starbrights. 
Then, he might hurt me. But not 
before.” 

“You have strange customs here.” 
“I don’t think so,” she replied log- 
ically. “A gentleman would never 
think of harming a girl like me, but 
naturally there is nothing to prevent 
a husband from harming his wife. 
Everybody knows that.” 

“And is that why you don’t want 
to marry Hauken?” 

Lulu sat for several moments con- 
sidering it. Then she shook her head, 
making her golden hair form a brief 
halo about it. “I really never thought 
about that. I never expected it to go 
that far. Oh, dear!” 

“Well,” Macnessa said gently, “he 
doesn’t have the starbrights yet.” 

“He will get them. You think you 
have hidden them well, and maybe 
you have. But if he doesn’t find them, 
he win simply torture the informa- 
tion out of you. That is what the ma- 
chines in the big room are for.” 
Macnessa turned and contemplated 
the torture instruments through the 
barred door to his cell, and involun- 
tarily shuddered* 



“I am very sorry, Sean,” said 
Lulu. “Really I am. Are your star- 
brights very good?” 

“Some of them are extremely 
good,” he told her gravely. 

She sighed. “Well, then be will 
marry me, an)rway. So I shall just 
have to marry him without the star- 
brights. My father won’t like k. But 
since Lord Hauken will make me 
marry him one way or another, you 
see, I might as well do things so ^at 
you don’t get hurt. Only h*s a pity 
that the family jewel collection wiU 
not benefit from my marriage.” 

“Can you do this?” 

“Certainly!” Lulu said. “You don’t 
think we are a primitive culture, do 
you? A princess is permitted to mar- 
ry without a marriage gift if she 
wants to.” 

“Thank you very much,” Macnessa 
said. “It is very generous of you.” 

“I think so, too,” said Lulu. “I’m 
glad you appreciate it. I’ll tell the 
guards when they check us on the 
next change of watch.” 

Macnessa smiled. “Perhaps it 
won’t be necessary. I am not without 
a certain ingenuity, Princess Lulu.” 
“If you are going to address me as 
a princess, you must use my proper 
name of Tintinetta. You can only call 
me Lulu when you address me as a 
woman.” 

“I — ah — I shall try to keep 
that in mind. Princess,” Macnessa 
murmured. 

“And if by your ingenuity you 
mean that you are planning to escape, 
you don’t have much time,” she went 
on. “It won’t take Lord Hauken long 
to discover you have hidden your 
treasure. This will make him angry.” 



54 



IF 




Macnessa agreed that Hauken 
might get angry, upon which the girl 
burst out eagerly, “Incidentally, where 
did you hide your treasure?” 

“In a safe place.” 

“All right,” she pouted. “You 
don’t have to tell me if you don’t 
want to.” Then she angrily pulled the 
curtain across the opening. 

M acnessa shrugged, moved to the 
table, and set about his plans. 
After several minutes, however, he 
discovered that he lacked an essential 
part of the apparatus he expected to 
construct. He wondered if the luck 
of the Centauri were deserting him. 

Soon the princess relented, drew 
the curtain back again and insisted on 
attention. When Macnessa humored 
her, he noticed that she had changed 
her attire; she was now wearing a new 
gown and some jewelry. There was a 
string of seven very large pearls which 
she said her mother had given her 
to wear only a few days before she 
had been kidnapped. She was very 
pleased with them. Macnessa did not 
tell her that they obviously were not 
genuine. 

What interested him considerably 
more was a chain of concave silver 
spangles that she wore. They were 
almost precisely the right size and 
curvature for his needs. 

Agreeably, she let him remove one 
of them from the chain, and he set to 
work on his apparatus. Using the sil- 
ver spangle as a mirror, and several 
of the lenses prised from the radiant 
heating, he was able to construct a 
fairly adequate arrangement. The 
lenses were not ground to the proper 
focal distances, of course. But a gem 



trader has necessarily an excellent 
background in optics. And Lulu was 
able to provide an adequate grinding 
compound in her silver polish. 

Finally, Macnessa pulled off one of 
the round, plastic buttons from his 
tunic. 

“What is that you are making?” 
Lulu demanded. 

“It i^ called a Golden Ruberg, 
after a mythological genius.” 

“Did Ruberg come from Centau- 
rus?” 

“Ruberg, if he ever existed, lived 
long before Centaurus’s humans came 
out to the stars. AU a Golden Ruberg 
really is, I guess, is a complicated- 
looking gadget.” 

“Does it do anything?” 

“I certainly hope so,” said Mac- 
nessa. He fashioned a hood for the 
main focal point, connected it to a 
release lever and began to peel the 
plastic off the button. 

About that time, a sound came 
from the big room outside. Macnessa 
hastily shoved his Golden Ruberg un- 
der the bunk. As he straightened up, 
the door to the cell was unlocked and 
two guards entered. 

“Just a check-up,” one of them 
said. “Change of watch.” 

They looked around the room, ex- 
amined the remains of the lunch Mac- 
nessa had dialed from the food dis- 
penser. One of them was about to 
look under the bunk, when a shriek 
came from Lulu’s cell. 

“I’m dying,” she exclaimed. “I’m 
bleeding to death. Help!” 

Hastily the guards rushed out, 
locking the cell door behind them, 
and entered into Lulu’s cell. It was 
difficult for Macnessa to tell precisely 



STARBRIGHT

what was going on, but apparently 
Lulu had cut herself. 

The guards were clearfy angry. 
The cut did not strike them as seri- 
ous, but they felt it necessary to 
see to it that she was placated. 

W hen they finally left, taking her 
broken spangle chain with 
them, they did not think to complete 
the interrupted search of Macnessa’s 
cell. 

“What happened?” he asked after 
Lulu returned to the grill panel. 

“I was watching through the cur- 
tain,” she said. “I knew you had 
hidden your Golden Bugbird under 
the bunk where they were going to 
look. And I couldn’t think of any- 
think to distract them except cut my 
finger on one of my spangles. I had 
to do something, didn’t I?” 

“You did marvelously,” Macnessa 
assured her. “I hope it wasn’t too 
painful.” 

“It was very painful.” She held up 
the index finger of her left hand with 
its tiny little bandage. “But one must 
be brave when one is a princess, don’t 
you think?” 

Macnessa agreed that a princess 
must be brave, and that she was every 
bit a princess. 

“Good,” she said happily. “Now 
you will tell me what the Golden 
Bugbed does.” 

“First I must finish it.” 

“You don’t have much time left. 
I’m perfectly safe, but I am afraid 
you are not. Perhaps it is already too 
late, because once Lord Hauken is 
angry, he gets mean.” 

Macnessa retrieved the apparatus 
from underneath the bunk. He took 



the plastic button which he had re- 
moved from his tunic and peeled the 
casing off, revealing a small, black 
sphere. He then polished it to a fine 
slick surface with some of Lulu’s face 
powder. 

“That doesn’t look very impor- 
tant,” she said doubtfully as she 
watched. 

Macnessa took it over to her 
and let her hold it. “Notice any- 
thing?” he asked. 

“It’s shiny.” 

“Anything else?” 

“You must have rubbed it very 
hard, because it is still warm.” 

“The heat doesn’t come from rub- 
bing,” he told her. You are hdding 
a black starbright.” 

“Oh, dear. Is that where you keep 
them — in your buttons?” She gig- 
gled. “Lord Hauken will be so angry. 
He will plan a very long and un- 
pleasant death for you.” 

“What a charming imaginatiwi you 
have,” Macnessa grumbled, taking 
the black starbright and inserting it 
into the device. This operation was a 
little tricky, because he had to shield 
it with his hands until he could get 
the tiny hood over it. “There,” he 
said. “It’s finished.” He held it up for 
to see. 

“So that’s a Golden Bedbug,” she 
said, her eyes wide with wonder. 
“Ruberg. Not bedbug.” 

“Oh. All ri^t. Now what? Do you 
say some magic words?” 

“No words are necessary. I simply 
press this trigger-like lever, that pusl^ 
es on this stanchion, the stanchion 
leans and forces this little rod over, 
and that lifts the hood off the black 
starbright. Then, if the optical sys- 



56 



IF 




tern is properly set up, the device 
behaves as a powerful laser.” 

L ulu had more questions, but Mac- 
nessa had heard more racket 
from the outer room again. Hastily 
he was trying to test the device. The 
opportunity was denied him. 

A jangling of keys sounded in the 
door. Lord Hauken’s voice com- 
manded the single guard who ac- 
companied him to ready one of the 
pieces of torture apparatus. The door 
opened, and he stood there, scowling, 
while behind him the guard could be 
seen busily uncovering what appeared 
to be a large electric grill. 

“You mock me by hiding things 
too well, Macnessa. So much the 
worse for you. It will merely be nec- 
essary for me to interrogate you for 
a while.” He stopped frowning. 

“What is that?” he demanded, 
pointing at the apparatus. 

“You wanted a starbright,” said 
Macnessa. “This is one — ” 

Lord Hauken interrupted him. “Of 
course,” he spiiled. “Your buttons. I 
see you have removed one. Well, 
never mind removing the others. I’ll 
do that myself, while my man fries 
3^our liver a little.” The smile van- 
ished as he added, “I am not accus- 
tomed to being kept waiting,” 

He advanced into the room. 



emitted into a thin, intense beam. 

Hauken screamed briefly and top- 
pled, acrid smoke arising from his 
head. As the guard turned, reaching 
for his sidearm, Macnessa held the 
trigger down and swept the beam in 
that direction. The guard yelped, his 
wrist badly seared, and let the weap- 
on fall. 

Macnessa quickly stepped out and 
scooped it up. 

It took ordy a few minutes to truss 
the lightly injured guard up and lock 
him in a cell. Macnessa then let Lulu 
out, and they dressed in the uniform 
capes that Hauken and the guard 
had worn. The fit was poor on both, 
but it was unlikely that anybody 
would question them closely. 

Lulu said happily, “Oh, good! Now 
I can marry you instead of that awful 
Lord Hauken.” 

S everal hours later, Macnessa was 
relating it all to Ommaley, in the 
latter’s hotel suite. 

“I had picked up that black in a 
trade for some other material. It was 
too small to be of much value com- 
mercially, but it was a starbright.” 
“And you have a certain affection 
for starbrights. Fascinating. What did 



Macnessa aimed the optical system 
and pressed the lever. The hood was 
withdrawn from the starbright. The 
room was already at a high level of 
ambient illumination, and the lenses 
greatly increased the capture area 
of the small stone, while at the same 
time they focused the coherent infra- 
red radiation which the starbright

Lord Brandt say when you returned 
his daughter and advis^ that Lord 
Hauken had suffered a slightly incin- 
erated brain?” 

“He was most grateful, of course. 
There was some embarrassment over 
Lulu’s insistence on marrying me, but 
her mother managed to talk her out 
of it. Instead of giving herself to me, 
she gave me one of her imitation 
pearls.” 

“One of the imitation pearls?” 
Ommaley chuckled good-naturedly. 

“This one.” Macnessa held it up 
with mild disgust. “I had to accept 
it. It was the only polite thing to 
do.” 

Ommaley reached for it and exam- 
ined it carefully. He hummed a little 
tune as he turned it around in his 
fingers. 

“Naturally, what I was hoping for 
was the sort of reward that only the 
Family Brandt could give,” Macnessa 
went on. “It didn’t take much reflec- 
tion to realize that they were the 
only ones in the system who had ma- 
terial suitable for trading. Given the 
custody of display prevalent here, 
when you told me that Lady Brandt 
had taken to mourning dress, I sus- 
pected that she had pledged the fam- 



ily jewels in return for all the star- 
brights in the system.” 

“And did you,” said Ommaley, as 
he busily worked on the imitation 
pearl with a small knife, “conclude 
who would be the only trader in this 
system who could be trusted to ar- 
range such a deal in complete so- 
crecy?” 

Macnessa’s mouth fell open with 
astonishment. He said, “Ommaley, 
you old jewel thief. You did this to 
me!” 

“What I should have done,” Om- 
maley said, “was to buy this worth- 
less-looking bauble from you for half 
a credit. Instead, I expend nay own 
time and energy in removing the 
casing with which I so carefully cam- 
ouflaged it. Poor Hauken! He want- 
ed starbrights, and he ended up with 
every starbright within twenty light- 
years in his own basement.” 

He removed the last shreds of the 
opaque casing, burnished the core 
with his sleeve, and held it up to the 
light. 

It was a perfect sphere, about ten 
millimeters in diameter. And even in 
the dim light of the study, it glowed 
like a tiny, blood-red star.

A REPORT ON THE SIXTH 
INTERNATIONAL SF FILM FESTIVAL 



L ast July the lovely Italian city of 
Trieste offered its annual week 
fully dedicated to science-fiction 
movies. 

Several countries have entered the 
Trieste Science-Fiction Film Festival 
with different kinds of movies^ all of 
them well worth seeing. 

Mostly interesting, this year’s fes- 
tival offered a wide range among 
science-fiction film trends. US and 
Japan cooperated to create the space 
opera Battle Beyond the Stars; Great 
Britain gathered the First Award for 
the best movie with an horror fan- 
tasy, The Sorcerers, which also got 
a prize for Catherine Lacey as best 
actress and a Gold Medal to its star 
Boris Karloff; the monster saga was 
introduced by the mighty Japanese 
spectacle Ebirah, starring Godzilla 
and Mothra in a satiric vein; a future 
space world was shown in the Rus- 
sian movie The Andromeda Nebula; 
a plain satire was Please, Don*t Joke 
with Martians, from France; an adult 
political drama was the Czech shock- 
er 1, the Justice; even the robot 
theme was masterfully treated in the 
best Asimov vein by another Rus- 
sian spectacle. Its Name Was Robert, 
Apart from the awards released 
from the international jury held by 
famed Italian writer and movie di- 
rector Mario Soldati, the best movie 
shown in Trieste was The Androme^ 
da Nebula. It is a pretty faithful 



adaptation of the same novel by 
Ivan Efremov (see article in Inter- 
national Science Fiction No. 2). This 
movie can be easily considered as 
the Russian answer to Stanley Ku- 
brick’s 2001: A space Odyssey — 
and really it is. Most astounding of 
all, The Andromeda Nebula as 
shown in Trieste is just the first of 
four colossal movies covering the 
whole Efremov book: movies No. 2 
and 3 have already been completed 
and the fourth one is in the works. 
This Russian cycle will be long re- 
membered as one of cinematographic 
marvels. 

Several other movies of short 
length have been shown here in Tri- 
este. I myself entered the Festival 
with a short fantasy, Isabell, a dream. 
The best of all was a French fan- 
tasy, The Cage of Stone, one of the 
best ventures into this field ever 
made. 

Boris Karloff got high ratings as 
starring in The Sorcerers, as he was 
in two other classic movies shown 
here in Trieste: The Black Cat and 
The Bride of Frankenstein. 

The festivd included an exhibition 
of fanzines from all over the world. 
Fans gathered from all countries. 

As Forrest Ackerman wrote in to 
the committee head of Sixth Trieste 
Science Fiction Film Festival: “May 
sf films and festivals always become 
betterl” —LUIGI COZZI

IF • Short Story 



TUT SEISOII 

by LAWRENCE AAAYER 



J eff said: “The season’s coming. 
I can feel it In my bones.” 
Mark groaned. They were stand- 
ing by the water cooler, drinking. 
It was late afternoon; the office was 
restless, slack. Mark said: “I don’t 
feel up to it, this year.” 
“Tomorrow you’ll feel different,” 
Jeff said. 

Mark grunted his displeasure. 
But he knew Jeff was right. The 
idea was unthinkable, disgusting . 
until tile season. Then it over- 
powered a man. And the time was 
soon. You could almost smell it in 
the air. The calendar said so too. 
There was a budding in his senses; 
his eyes kept peering toward Daisy, 
almost involuntarily; that was a 
sign. She worked in advertising. 
They were friends and bridge part- 
ners the rest of the year. And dur- 
ing the season, they had a long- 
standing arrangement. 



Daisy too kept watching him all 
day, talking to him, touching him 
when she could. “You’re ed^ 
Mark,” she said. “It’s because of 
the season, isn’t it?” But he denied 
it, out of mascline pride. “Hell, 
it’s this pile-up of work,” he said. 
“It’s getting on my nerves. One 
good thing: when the siren goes 
off, I can tell the boss to go to 
hell.” 

“Hey, Daisy, how about switch- 
ing this time?” Jeff said. “Get rid 
of this guy.” 

“I’m not thinking of anybody,*^ 
she said. 

“Come on, we’ll have a ball,” 
Jeff said. 

“A ball, ha. You don’t get preg- 
nant.” 

She was good-looking, Daisy. 
Young and succulent. Good figure, 
pleasant eyes. Mark found himself 
staring, vaguely, at the sweet line

An IF First 

Every month If brings you the first pub- 
lished story of a new writer. This month, 
our writer is Lawrence Mayer, who com- 
bines a strong interest in sociology with 
a long-time interest in science fiction. 
Married and with two children. Among 
his other interests are music and history. 
We hope to see more stories in which 
he can combine his hobbies and his 
writing. 



of her blouse. A small distant 
shadow crossed his mind. He felt 
something deep in his body, slight, 
bothersome, like the tickle of a 
feather. He tried to remember what 
it felt like, a year before, with 
Daisy. No use. Not yet. But the 
sirens would be soimded soon, for 
sure... as usual, he wouldn’t feel 
ready .... 

Early June, yes, that was the 
time. In the nurseries, hundreds of 
thousands of babies, now three 
months old, cried for their milk. 
Dogs would be howling at the moon, 
cats scratching and whining at the 
doors .... 

He sighed, put down his cup and 
went back to his desk. 

TVyTark lived alone, in a tall 
apartment house, not far from 
downtown. From his living-room 
window, he could see at night the 
bright city lights. Most men his age 
preferred dormitory life; but some- 
thing in his nature liked living alone. 
Not that he lacked for good com- 
pany. Jeff lived down the hall, 

THAT SEASON 



Marie and her friends across the 
street. Yet he felt, from time to 
time, a certain sourness in his soul, 
a cmrdled enptiness. What was it 
that was lac^g? Was it kinship, 
was it warmth? In the old days, 
before the Great Change, people 
lived in family groups. A man of 
his age, and social class, would have 
lived very differently then... with 
a wdfe, small kids, a home, a mother 
and dad .... 

What a difference had come from 
that slight chemical change, carried 
in the air! A slight alteration of 
the genes: and society, irreversibly, 
was twisted out of joint. Mark often 
wondered: what was it really like, 
before? What was the texture of 
living then? He knew the gross facts 
from the books — about marriage, 
families, and divorce, about babies 
bom tiiroughout the year, and 
brought up at home. Grown men 
rarely lived in dormitories then. 
They had houses, homes, they had 
wives that cooked their food, loved 
them, took care of the kids. 

Some things died slowly. Taking 
care of kids was still women’s work. 
Some even raised children in their 
flats — sometimes their imn 
children, too. But more and more 
women lived with their friends, in 
dormitories, apartments and clubs. 
Children grew up in nurseries and 
boarding schools, along with other 
children of their age. During birth- 
day-months (April and March) 
everybody tinned out to help chil- 

61 





dren celebrate. Even men took part. 
Babies were not to most men’s 
^tastes, but they liked to lend a hand 
tin the raising of small boys, teach- 
^ing them baseball, or swimming, or 
'masculine crafts, taking them on 
hikes or to the zoo. A few men 
formed attachment with boys whom 
they knew or thought to be their 
sons. Usually, it was hard to be 
sure. 

All in all, though, during most of 
the year, the texture of life seemed, 
on the surface, much the same as 
before the Great Change. Or so 
Mark thought. Men slept, woke up, 
ate, went to work, worked a day, 
and went home. The big difference 
came once a year, that was all. 
When the sirens blew. 

I t was almost nine when Mark 
woke. He slid out of bed, yawn- 
ing. To his annoyance, old Edna, the 
scrubwoman, was standing near his 
bed. He must have left his door 
unlocked. She was staring at him, 
licking her lips. 

Good God, it’s coming soon, he 
said to himself. He pushed her out 
of his apartment. She made a pitiful 
squealing noise as he slammed the 
door in her face. She was ugly as 
sin. He showered and shaved as 
quickly as he could. He wondered, 
did it pay to go down to the office, 
or not? No sirens had sounded; 
sometimes it took days to work up 
to that point. Still, the authorities 
were rather on the conservative 



side; they sounded the horns only 
when absolutely sure. He flipped 
a coin; and decided to take the 
chance ... he had so much to do 
at the office. His flesh had that 
creeping feeling, his head was mild- 
ly dizzy, but he thought: there’s 
still a little time. 

Edna was still in the hallway as 
he left. She stared at him. He locked 
the door and ran to the elevator. 
Traffic on the way to work was 
curiously unyielding. A certain 
tang of irresponsibility hung in the 
air. Not a leaf stirred in the trees. 
Gray-bellied clouds hugged the 
horizon. The air was sultry, moist. 

He parked in the company lot 
and went up to the office. Nobody 
was there but poor Miss Grimm, 
tottering about in the file room. She 
was, of course, much too old to be 
affected by the sirens. Still, he 
warned her, shouting loudly (she 
was deaf as a post) that the sirens 
might sound at any minute. She 
thanked him and hobbled away. She, 
like other women of her age, would 
spend the weeks of the season at 
the nurseries, helping out. Every 
young woman ran away. The whole 
population of babies would surely 
have died, each year, except for the 
white-haired crew of women like 
Miss Grimm, who came streaming 
in when the sirens blew. They used 
the nursery as a refuge from the 
madness of the world; and paid for 
their sanctuary by caring for man- 
kind’s young.

Mark sat at his desk, playing with 
a pencil. He should never have 
come, he thought. He could not 
concentrate. He could scarcely 
scratch a word or two on paper with- 
out thinking of Daisy The clock 
struck ten. He tore off his tie. He 
was sweating. It was late, late, late. 
His whole body pulsed with a rage 
of feeling. Then the siren sounded: 
a high-pitched whining scream. It 
had an almost physical impact. He 
ran through the office, to the door. 
Outside, he collided with Daisy. 

She screamed, half in delight. 
knew you’d be herel I knew itl” 
He dragged her by the waist in- 
to the boss’s suite of offices. She 
seemed nearly faint with expecta- 
tion: her eyes were glazed, she 
breathed deeply, her body trembled. 
He closed the door behind them. 

L ater on, in the afternoon, they 
smoked a cigarette together 
and talked rationally about their 
situation. “I’ve got to get you to my 
place,” he said. 

Daisy whimpered, “Can’t we stay 
here?” “We’d starve,” he said. 
“There’s nothing to eat, not even 
a candy bar. The cafeteria’s closed; 
the food’s locked up. And where 
will we sleep?” 

“Right here,” Daisy said. She 
was frightened now. 

“It’s too dangerous. The boss 
might come ... or Jerry ... or Jeff 
... or anybody. We’ve got to try 
it. My car’s downstairs.” 



They waited for darkness. When 
night arrived, they slipped crat the 
door and down the hahway. A man 
lay in a heap near the elevator, 
his clothes in disarray, a dark stain 
of matted blood beside him. He 
moaned; they ignored him. “Let’s 
take the stairs,” Mark said. The 
elevator was too much of a risk: 
who knows who was hiding there? 
In the lobby, they saw a small group 
of elderly men, standing about. 
When the men saw Daisy, a great 
howl went up. One of the men 
started running toward them. He 
was white-haired, heavy; Mark 
recognized Gifford, the insurance 
broker whose office was on the 14th 
floor. “Get going,”’ he told Daisy. 
They ran out through the service 
entrance, slamming the door in the 
broker’s face. 

Mark’s was the only car on the 
lot. He had forgotten to lock it, 
and two youngsters were in the 
back seat. The boy was scrawny 
and pimply-faced, no more than 
fifteen, the girl scarcely older. Mark 
threw them out bodily. The boy 
ran; the girl clung to Mark, panting 
hard. He looked into her face, then 
put her down on the back seat and 
started to undress. “Please, please,” 
Daisy begged. A crowd of young 
males, armed with sticks, knives, 
and stones, stormed onto the park- 
ing lot. “They’ll kill you!” Daisy 
said. He picked up the girl and 
put her down on the groimd. The 
gang rushed toward her like ^arks 



THAT SEASON

drawn by blood, mat gave tbem 
their chance. Mark started the 
motor, and the car raced away. 

It was only a short distance to 
his apartment, but his heart was in 
his mouth the whole way. No street 
lights shone; no buses or taxis were 
running; few cars could be seen on 
the street. An early, eerie moon 
passed like a ghost in the sky. He 
drove slowly and carefully once he 
got onto the street. The streets 
were unsafe. Mobs of young men 
prowled up and down, hunters of 
prey, smashing down doors, break- 
ing windows, looking for girls. Many 
would fail in their search. They 
would suffer the tortures of frus- 
tration, or settle for an old, un- 
attractive, desperate woman, wan- 
dering the streets looking for men; 
or, when these too were gone, turn 
to howling and looting and de- 
struction. 

Mark drove without lights. Daisy 
crouched in the back of the car. 
The mobs would have pulled her 
out bodily, if they saw her, and 
killed Mark, too if he fought. Vio- 
lent crime, in season, was a roaring 
tide. Policemen stopped work when 
the sirens blew; armies melted 
away. Afterward, there was little 
that could be done to mend the 
damage. By law, any violence over 
a woman was not punishable; that 
was simply the way of the world. 
Other crimes of violence were hard 
to prosecute, for lack of evidence; 
juries set free all but those who 



committed the grossest of crimes. 
If a crowd of boys smashed Mark 
to death, who was to say that he 
died defending a woman, or out of 
the simple blood-lust of the crowd? 
And for him, of course, any verdict 
would come much too late. It was 
foolish to go out on the streets, 
except with a pack or gang of men. 
Many no doubt lay bleeding in the 
gutters already, drunk and dying 
alone. 

“Hurry, darling, hurry,” Daisy 
whispered. 

On the horizon, the red glow of a 
fire, burning out of control. 

They reached the apartment with- 
out incident. He parked his car 
in the alley behind the building. 
They entered quietly through the 
rear door and took the stairs. They 
had eight flights to climb. When 
they reached his floor, they were 
both exhausted; they clung to each 
other. He felt her warm breath near 
his ear. 

He took out his key. A heavy 
hand closed on his wrist. It was 
Jeff, blocking the way. 

“What the hell are you doing 
here?” 

Jeff said: “You damn well know.” 

“Where’s Marie?” 

“She’s gone off . with some- 
body else.” 

Jeff was younger than Mark, and 
heavier: a good athlete. The wise 
man might have let Daisy go. 
But if he had, he would have been 
forced out onto the street, to join 



64 



IF 




the gangs. And that was hell. He 
would rather fight. Then, too, he 
felt his blood grow hot inside of 
him, felt an animal instinct to de- 
fend his mate* 

Cautiously, they circled about 
each other, looking for an opening. 
Daisy stood to one side, nervously 
smoking a cigarette. Whatever her 
preferences, she would go with the 
winner. She had to. The Great 
Change had been fatal to certain 
kinds of romantic love. Now Jeff 
darted forward and grappled with 
Mark; Mark struck back, savagely 
kicking, biting, and punching. He 
had to be vidous and fast; it was 
his only hope. Jeff’s heavy fist 
caught him full on the face; Mark’s 
jaw oozed blood. He shifted to one 
side breathing heavily; he caught 
Jeff off balance, tripped him, sent 
him crashing to the floor. Jeff 
reached for a knife. But Mark had 
thrown himself on top of Jeff’s 
body; now he bit Jeff’s wrist, as 
hard as he could; Jeff shrieked in 
pain; his arm spurted blood. The 
knife flew down the corridor. Mark 
pressed his advantage,, pounding 
Jeff’s skull against the floor until 
his eyes glazed and his body went 
limp. 

Edna, the cleaning woman, stood 
in the shadows, himched over, like 
a buzzard, waiting .... 

“Let’s go,” Mark whispered to 
Daisy. She crushed her cigarette 
underfoot and followed him. Jeff 
stirred and moaned dimly. Edna 



dabbed at his bleeding skull with 
a rag. Mark had the key now; he 
opened his door, pulled Dai^ in-^ 
side, they locked and bolted flwm-^ 
selves inside. They were sale now.. 
They had food, warmth, and sane-; 
tuary . and a soft massive bed. 

D ays and nights passed by, in 
a dream-like frenzy. In the 
streets, the panic reached its bei^t. 
Angry mobs pillaged every hmise 
with an unlocked door. It seemed 
to ihim the season had never been 
worse — never more concenUated, 
frantic, unbound. Luckily, the bolts 
held on the door, and the windows 
were too hi^ to be dunbed. He 
was more thankful than ever for 
his privacy. God, the madness #f 
gang life, the insanity of those 
dormitories, for men and women 
alike .... 

Toward the middle of the second 
week, Daisy’s naood turned sudden- 
ly sour. She was pregnant, she said. 
She said, love made her sick to her 
stomach. But he was stiD a roaring 
fire “Danm it,” he said, “it’s too 
soon to turn off.” She sobbed, she 
begged, she demanded. But his 
body still screamed with desire; 
and she was trapped. So, too, was 
he. 

A few days passed. He woke up 
one morning, early; brilliant sun- 
shine stream^ through the blinds. 
Daisy was awake, reading a maga- 
zine in bed. He reached out and 
lightly embraced her. She yawned 



THAT SEASON 



65 




in his face. Her skin felt clammy 
to the touch. He disengaged bun- 
self, showered and got dressed. It’s 
ending, he said to himself. 

He stiU felt great affection for 
Daisy; from time to time, he ca- 
ressed her, or gave her a brotherly 
kiss. She found a pap^back copy 
bf Gon^ With the Wind, and spent 
the day reading it, coyer to cover. 
Petite her nausea, she was raven- 
jous for dinner. He made her a 
feast, *‘to celebrate,” out of the rest 
jof his stock of food: a good strong 
steak, a salad and bread, washed 
Sown with a bottle of wine. 

“Till next year,” he said, raising 
his glass in a toast. 

She puckered her lips. “Next 
year I might switch. For a change.” 

“I’ll kill the guy,” Mark said. 
But he knew it might happen. 
Three years before, she had gone 
over to Jeff, halfway through, and 
he went to Marie. Next year, who 
knows? 

But the strain of this season was 
over; that was well worth a toast. 
The wine went to their heads; they 
giggled, rubbed noses, held hands 
and went early to bed. In the morn- 
ing, a noxious fog crept through the 
window. He shut the blinds and 
shivered. They dressed like stran- 
gers, irritably waiting for a signal. 
Even the motion of a kiss was re- 
volting. 

At ten o’clock the siren sounded; 
it was always a trifle on the con- 
servative side. “Can I give you a 



lift?” he asked Daisy. §h^ smd;] 
“Take me home. I’ve got to picM 
up some stuff. Then you can drive 
me to work.” By noon, they were 
all back at the office. Mark looked 
for Jeff; when he found him, they 
grinned and shook hands. Jeff’s 
face was bruised and bandaged; one 
eye was still swollen out of shape. 

“Sorry, boy.” 

“Forget it.” 

The first day back at work was 
always hairy. The boss was ill- 
tempered and coarse, as expected. 
The men on the staff were exhaus- 
ted; some limped and mused their 
wounds. The women were more or 
less morning-sick. 

Jeff said: “How about bridge? 
Tonight, at my place. You too 
tired?” 

No, it soimded fine to Mark. 
“Gooi it’s a date.” He drove out 
after work with Daisy and Marie. 
They ate pizzas and drank wine, 
and sang and played cards. A driv- 
ing rain poimded on the windows, 
so the girls stayed the night, on the 
couches, and made breakfast for the 
four of them at dawn. The season 
was only memory now — less real 
than a dream. At breakfast, not 
a whisper of the season intruded. 
They made waffles and drank cof- 
fee, and teased each other like 
small children; then they drove to 
the office in one car, tired but 
happy, laughing over and over 
again at the jokes of the night be- 
fore. END

SPORK 

OF THE AYOR 

by PERRY A. CHAPDELAINE 

fllustrofed by REESE 



I, Sporkf am a true son of the Ayor, 
Buf what are the strange beings that 
look like me, who are called "human"? 



I 

T liad {o bear in minfl tbaf, 
A unlike other Ayorians, I was 
yiMble to many more wavelengths 
hi li^t than ultra-violet, yet I 
l^ted a perfectly dear view of 



the two T^)eh tr^. It was i mat- 
ter of revenge, and my vengeance 
for Erne’s murder must not be left 
jto chancel 

Near one of fiie Tepea traps 
there was a waterfall, cascading 
from level to levd high overhead. 



67 





I climbed to a small depression 
about one hundred feet above the 
two traps, half-hidden by the splat- 
tering, chilled water. I used only 
my leg and arm muscles, all the 
time reminding myself over and 
over again, “I must dq>end only 
on my physical strength, not my 
mind!” 

The ultra-violet hued sun over- 
head beat hot against my unpro- 
tected skin as I squatted down to 
wait restlessly. 

“How odd everything appears 
below,” I reflected. Never before 
had I voluntarily turned off my 
telekmass — mass sensing and 
telekinetic — faculties. Far below 
me, here and there across the bril- 
liant tapestry of the valley floor, 
I could see animals, and plants too, 
appearing and disappearing at ran- 
dom. Nothing had pattern or made 
sense ... except for the stupid 
Gen. 

It was incapable of teleporting 
itself, so it stayed always steady 
as a rock, teleporting debris of 
every kind into its own huge 
stomach. 

The heat was almost unbearable. 
I could do nothing about it. I knew 
if I were to use my indirect facul- 
ties to teleport away the moleades 
of high kinetic energy near my 
skin, thereby achieving comfort, I 
might all too easily become prey of 
the evil Tepeh! 

I crouched further bdiind the 
water-spray seeking its filtering 



protection from the mercilessly hot 
sim. Time passed while my body, 
unused to such energy burdens, 
quivered in agony. As my mind 
slowed, I dreamed fitfully. 

I dreamed primarily of Erne... 
of her loss... of how I came to 
accept not only her twinning prob- 
lem but the obligation to avenge 
her death. I dreamed of the long- 
distant day when I first came to 
Enithra, and she found me.... 

he big red ball bounced before 
me as I crawled on hands and 
knees, reaching expectantly for the 
bright, elusive object. It stopped. 
I grabbed for it with my hands 
and arms, only to miss as it jumped 
away again. 

Next I remembered the feel of 
the sharp prick-pain of the needle, 
the softness of my bed and cover-- 
ing pressure pushing against me, 
filling every centimeter of my six- 
month old body with the terror of 
falling. Then blessed sleep, so 
peaceful and calm, though each 
cell screamed still with its individ- 
ual entrapped fear. 

On that same day Eme*s 
thoughts were chiefly on her in- 
ability to twin, though she was long 
in years. When her telekmass re- 
ceptors sensed the large, hot body 
falling through Enithra^s outer at- 
mosphere, she extended her fine- 
tuning sensitivity to detect its 
twisted and tortured metallic 
compartments.

V *' 





Ev«n ms the dropfing object 
scooped' out. ten mUes or more of 
viotep and vHtra-rdolet jnngle 
gro^tit and Wi. before coming to 
test. Erne tdeported to the object. 

Now it rested. Within it she 
sensed Mo fine layers of organic 
chemictds, charred and flattened on 
two formed holding platforms. 
Slightly forward of these were me- 
chotUccd instruments which trig- 
gered gyeed fear in her slight body. 
They might be traps buUt by Tep- 
en — har here&dory enemies. 

It was already too late for re- 
treat; the acthity of her mass- 
sensing probes and tdekin- 
etic movements wovdd have given 
her away instantly. But nothing 
happened. She was greatly relieved 
when no Tepen energy net clasped 
at the magnetic structure of her 
bdng. 

But when she sensed the strange 
shidd of polarization suround- 
ing, in turn, the exceedingfy star- 
dense mass endonng many direct- 
action instruments, her caution and 
fear sprang forth again unbounded. 

In fha center of this red-hot mass 
was me. 

Was this a new kind of Tepen 
trapt Wovdd the Tepen use ordin- 
ary animal life, surrounded by 
strange machines and materials, to 
capture the 'Ayor?. 

Portunately for me, the code of 
twinsUng preverded her from Seeds- 
ing furth&r help of he^ kind, TMs 
puzzle was only hers to solvat 

79 



Erne, like oE other Ayorians ex- 
cept me, was transparent to every 
frequency except ultra-violet be- 
tween 10 “ and 10 *® cydes — a 
fact which has occasionally been 
used by the Tepen in their cap- 
ture. Site found herself a well hid- 
den cave several miles from the in- 
tensely radiating object where she 
cotdd feel at least partially safe 
from Tepen while her indirect fac- 
uUies continued to probe the wreck- 
age. 

She threw d protective tdeHne- 
tic shield over the conglomerate of 
metal and fused plastic to protect 
it from the ever-seeking tdehmass 
fingers of other Bsdthra plant and 
anitnal life. Then she carefiMy 
studied the sUdd of polarization 
'and its associated heavy mass, the 
broken and twisted direct-action 
instruments and the animal body 
which, at that time, was mine. 

She carefiMy studied every as- 
pect of the gross geometry too, for 
one of the lowest philosophical lea- 
ds in supprt of twinning requires 
knowledge of the geometry which 
replicates. 

Just above the two flatten^ 
smears of organic matter and im- 
mediately before the shield of po- 
larization were the strange figures; 

HEART 

_ OF THE HOUSE 
OF THE GALACTIC COUNCIL 

Her "huml^ge of ivttural staUsti- 

IF 




cdl puttems suggested that these 
figures might represent forms of di- 
rect-action communications. Per^ 
haps meaning lay in the spaces 
between each figure, or in thdr 
shapes. 

She died before this part of her 
twinning problem cotM be con- 
firmed. 

dozing mind screamed its 
•^^-■•grief helping to wake me as 
my musdes, too, began to shri^ 
their anger as I crouched so long 
and steadily beneath the waterfall^ 
waiting for the Tepen. 

I longed to teleport the diemi- 
cals of fatigue away from the peri- 
phery of my musdes, thus decreas- 
ing the pain sensation. But I dared 
not. 

The sun was lower now, only a 
few diameters above the tall moim- 
tain peak at the end of the valley. 
I stretched my leg and arm mus- 
des with direct-action physical mo- 
tion. It gave me considerable re- 
lease from the pain for a moment; 
then I forcibly stilled my body 
again. The pain returned; and it 
and the burning sun once again 
drove my thou^ts into reveries, 
back to Eme and her twinning 
problem, though every light and 
sound receptor of my being re- 
mained set on alert for Tepen .... 

As Eme^s mass sense passed back 
and forth through the smouldering 
object, it slowly cooled until all 
that remained to be studied was 



the animal — which was me — in 
the cetder, surrounded all around by 
Tepen4ike direct-action machines. 
Still wary of Tepen magnetic 
traps, she inspected the machines 
atom by atom. One, she discooer^ 
ed, seemed to move in periodic 
rhythm corresponding, roughly, to 
the period of motion of our planet 
Brdthra; but always it moved a 
tenth of a cycle faster. 

This same cyclical equipment 
seemed to cordrel the flaw of elec- 
trons in other parts of the complex 
apparatus. Wires and tubes at- 
tached to me pulsed with the life 
of chemicals or electrons. Vluids 
flowed in and cut of me; while cer- 
tain skin areas of my body changed 
density causing changes in dec- 
trornc flows. These changes, in 
their turn, caused other equip- 
ments to blow heavier or Ughtef, 
dir particles thrmghoul the hollow 
cubicle. 

Once she teleported radioactive 
particles away from the internal 
structure of the power source, not- 
ing how it affected the fhm of 
electrons in support of dd equip- 
ments — except one, the shield of 
polarization, wMch seemed to be 
generated as a by-product of the 
very dense metal surrounding all. 

Fate had handed Eme a power- 
ful puzzle as part of her tiwirming 
cycle; a puzzle which was com- 
pletely foreign to either her per- 
sonal experiences or those af h&t 
group! 



SPORK OF THE AY08 



71 




Now satisfied that no Tepen 
traps existed here, she opened her 
philosophical self to assist in her 
studies. Would that flow be animal 
blood? Could the other flow be the 
product of animal waste? What 
chemical was it? 

With her sensitive mass-receptor 
she explored the fine details of 
structure. She learned — iron so 
much, carbon so much, nitrogen so 
much, a little phosphorus here in 
just this shape. Swiftly, starting 
with the smallest chemical consist^ 
uents and their structure she 
pieced together her conclusions. 

Her original conjecture was ver- 
ified. A form of animal life was 
trapped inside the hollow object. 

Erne had need to call on ere- 
ative aspects of her philosophy. 
Other than distorted information 
about the direct-action devices of 
the evil Tepen, she had no other 
experiences remotely connected to 
this. It was a wonder she did not 
twin right at that point in time! 

As the jungle hours passed, ani- 
mal, but primarily Enithra plant- 
life, slowly reclaimed the charred 
area around the broken fragment 
from the sky. Erne, using the same 
methodical pattern she had used in 
study of the equipment surround- 
ing me, now began study of my 
immature form. 

How great her surprise must 
have been when, on exploring the 
neutral patterns of my mind having 
to do with ability to teleport and 
72 



to sense mass, she discovered these 
patterns to be incomplete! I had 
no telesenses at all! 

Time passed — I in my cubicle 
in drugged sleep and Erne in her 
cavern arranging and rearranging 
conjectures of her twinning prob- 
lem. The jungle was now nearly 
covering all. 

Though I was Eme*s personal 
twinning problem, the time of Ay- 
orian grouping approached — the 
time when all Ayors, hemisphere 
to hemisphere, stack themselves in 
a line as long in length as there 
are Ayors to form it. 

T^or much of my early life I was 
* unclear as to what occurred 
during the grouping. I have the 
wrong shape for it. My arms and 
legs, my light and sound and chem- 
ical receptors, do not match the 
Ayors. To fit the grouping pattern 
(me needs the "8” shape of the 
Ayorian, where the top hemisphere 
is hollow on one side and the bot- 
tom hemisphere is hollow in the 
opposite direction. Furthermore, my 
magnetic structure is weak. It is 
diffused cell by cell, rather than 
strong and unitary in nature. 

Later I learned that the time erf 
grouping enables all twinning prob- 
lems and their solutions to be 
shared by individual Ayors — as 
well as assisting the Ayor, as a 
racial whole, to achieve a higher 
evolutionary level. 

It was easy to understand Erne’s 

IF 




dilemma when she found me. If she 
left for the grouping, she would 
miss her individual advancement 
by skipping her personal twinning 
problem — me. On the other hand, 
if she didn^t attend the grouping, 
she missed her opportunity to as- 
sist in the advancement of the 
Ayor as a racial whole. She also 
would lose other Ayorian experi- 
ences which might materially as- 
sist her toward her next twinning. 

Since I was the central part of 
her twinning problem she resolved 
her difficult dilemma by teleport- 
ing me out from the wen protected 
cubick directly to the Ayorian 
grouping chamber some five miles 
below Enithra’s surface. 

Spray from the falling water 
chilled me in the here-and-now. 
The formerly broiling sun over- 
head was much cooler. Soon my 
skin shivered and tiny bumps 
formed from the cold. Thick haze 
appeared, consisting mostly of dust 
and vegetable oils. It thickened as 
the sun’s weakened image cast 
longer rays through the atmo- 
sphere. Along the valley floor, the 
teleporting plant and animal life 
merged into blurs of violet shad- 
ows. 

Hunger pangs began. I relieved 
them by groping and grasping with 
my arms and hands for fruits and 
nuts lying along the waterfalFs 
edge. I wondered how long I could 
go without sle^. But somehow, I 
vowed, in spite of cold, in ^ite of 



the lack of use of my indirect fac- 
ulties and other comforts which 
were yet to be taken from me, I 
would wait, catch and kill these 
evil TepenI 

N^r the clifFs base I quenched 
my thirst in a novd way. I used 
my hands; I stooped over, cupped 
both hands, filled them with water, 
raised them to my lips and drank! 
Could the Ayorian children have 
seen me, many hours of philosoph- 
ical games would have been stim- 
ulated by this novel way of drink- 
ing. 

Between me and the Tepen traps 
lay the flat, thickened membrane 
of plant growth, designed by na- 
ture to cover and protect a maxi- 
mum amount of soil nourishment 
from foreign seeds which might, 
by chance, have teleported to its 
base. The membrane provided a 
sufficiently strong telekinetic pro- 
tective field to prevent such seeds 
from sprouting. 

More by instinct than reason, I 
tore this plant membrane from the 
soil with my muscles. I shook the 
small nodules of earth loose from 
its underside and wrapped it 
around my shaking body. The pro- 
tective membrane provided satis- 
factory warmth at last I reflected 
on how discovery of such a novel 
use, alone, would have helped me 
to win in the children’s philosoph- 
ical games! 

I tied long strands of fibers to 
the two Tepen traps, being very 



SPORK OF THE AYOR 



73 




sure to hide the dead strands be- 
neath the soil* Then I pulled the 
other ends to my hiding place over- 
head. Enithra’s insistent plant and 
animal life would eventu^^y sense^ 
then tdqport needed materials from 
these dead, hidden strands, I knew. 
But probably they would last un- 
til mdining. 

Mjr stomach was full now, 
though I had accomplished it 
throQ^ the most unusual — and 
fatigpoing — way of diewing and 
swaSowing. With my body warmed 
by the organic membranes and the 
Tepea traps secured, weariness 
filled my body. I slept to dream 
again. 

T\e€ff below Enithra^s surface, 
^ Erne experimentally forced 
my nemomc growth, completing it. 
My indirect powers grew. This en- 
abled my body to assume the auto- 
nondc duties of self-protection 
from other seeking Enithra life 
forms, as my slower body growth 
consciously and unconsciously be- 
gan the arduous tasks which ac- 
company use of tdekmass facul- 
ties. 

I recovered my conscious aware- 
ness for the first time on Enithra 
whUe the Ayorian grouping assem- 
bled overhead. 

Bvorywhere around me were fas- 
cinating *Hoys^^ of different shapes, 
sizes and ^feeP\ I reached with 
my hands and arms to grasp arid 
fosfle them. Though my new mass- 
74 



sensing receptors assured me these 
^‘object^ were within **grasp”, my 
physical efforts were fruitless. My 
fingers came away empty. 

Bventudly I learned to reach 
for these new objects with my 
mind. By turning sensitivity for 
mass up or down, I could make 
small objects appear large or small 
according to my interest of the mo- 
ment. 

Though awakened in darkness, 
I perceived; though deep in the 
bowels of the earth, lacking food 
and oxygen, I nourished and 
breathed. Erne kept watch on my 
needs. Up around me, on all sides 
of me, were the Ayor, every one 
aligning himself according to their 
respective polarities and their re- 
spective philosophical attitudes, 
each sharing his twinning prob- 
lems and twinning experiences. 

Even one of Enters wonderftd 
talents could not completely solve 
my babyhood need for human at- 
tention and affection, though she 
came dose. By use of her telekin- 
etic power, she could cause differ- 
ent parts of my body to feel warm 
with pressure — as would be the 
case if a genuine human held and 
cuddled me. 

When an adult Ayorian ^Hwins,” 
he becomes two independent, sep- 
arated Ayorian *^childrenJ* Each 
Ayorian chUd has increased abili- 
ties along the lines which caused 
his **parenV^ to twin; but none has 
the memories of his parent. 



IF 




Ayorian evolutionary po~ 
gress can be measured by individ- 
ual twinnings as ieeU as group 
growth from group-accepted poS- 
lems. My 'dreams, hdmuped for 
but a moment, continued with my 
first groupng where the dialogue, 
weaved itself into my dreams: 

**Ee is atdmal in body, thus non- 
'Ayorian” said one of the group. 

"He has a completed neuronic 
powth giving him the indirect fac- 
tdties,” another forced into the co- 
ordinated assemblage. 

"He must be Pought to full 
self-sufficiency,” another respotid- 
ed. 

*‘Place him with the children un- 
til he develops; Bme shall guide 
him until her twinuing.” 

In my sleeping mind echo&d 
clearly the 'Ayorians booming tones 
over and ovet again, "Erne shall 
guide Mm; Bme shtdl guide him; 
Bme shad guide Mm ...I” 

But Bme was dead. 

n 

Qeardung, scorching beat of the 
^ sun wobe me up. 

Below an3 all arountl Eidtbrai 
life stirred. It moved in jerky, dis- 
continuous jumps, grasping with 
hungry power. No dou^ hid the 
sun’s rays. And as far as my li^t 
receptors could percdve, ' no evil 
Tepm traveled on the v^qr floor 
hdW. 

I scurried <qui(±Iy down to the 
SPOMC OF THE AYOR 



waterfall’s basin, again using only 
my direct faculties of arms, legs 
and mouth to dean, move, eat^ and 
drink. Though my musdes ached 
excruciatingly, I returned to a\mt 
the Tepen. 

I was fully consdous on this 
second day. Certainty I was suf- 
fering less from exposure to heat 
than the day before. Almost re- 
laxed, I ddiberatety brought to 
mind my most early life with the 
children. 

Constantty thq^ laughed at me; 
my awkwardness in the use of in- 
direct faculties was as dumsy as 
the very yomigest of the Ayorian 
children. 

“Spork!” thqr shouted wiUi glee. 
In Ayorian language it means 
“moron.” 

They could talk and bear by vi- 
brating the concave side of the 
hemi^here which composed the 
top half of thdr body. It was my 
only advanti^e over them. I ^s 
far superiw in these two faculties. 
But it was trivial. What was im- 
portant was the td^mass— mass 
sensing and tdekinetic — faculties. 

Like duldren everywhere, Ayor- 
ian children played those games, 
which were si 5 q)osed to prqjare 
ititftm for the serious re^nsibili- 
ties of maturity. 

In “hide-and-seek”, one playing 
member teleports an object to an 
unknown location. When the dgnd 
is given, all others enlarge their 
tdekmass network in eyer-expand* 

75 




ing radii in search of the hidden 
object. Though the object might be 
hidden, say, only twenty miles 
away, each position in a three-di- 
mensional sphere surrounding each 
playing member must be inspected. 
At each linear increase" of the 
searching sphere’s radius, each 
member has need to strain; the 
volume of positions to be searched 
increases by the cube of the rad- 
ius. 

Though most A5mrian children 
rapidly achieve a capability which 
includes all of Enithra, I could 
never find an object beyond a 
forty mile radius. This will give 
some idea of just how moronic I 
was I 

Another common game was 
called “squeezing”. Each player at- 
tempts to teleport the other; each 
resists the other. If the players are 
evenly matched, each feels as 
though he is “squeezed.” Eventu- 
ally one gives way and loses. 

During my very early childhood, 
I was better at “squeezing” than 
other Ayorian children because of 
my greater mass. But, all adult Ay- 
orians could always handle me 
with great ease. 

A third game was called “null- 
thought”. It consists of shutting off 
one’s thought processes. While 
most Ayorians, with their unified 
magnetic field of thought, were ex- 
pert at it, I, with my biological 
processes and their associated 
small, cellular, independent 



magnetic-fields, continually broad- 
cast loud identity waves in all <fi- 
rections. 

My best game was “philosoph- 
ical speculations”. An object or set 
of relationships of any kind is se- 
lected for the game. This object or 
set of relationships may be almost 
anything. Each of us children 
woidd contemplate on the object or 
relationship. If an object were 
chosen, we extended our mass-sen- 
sors down to lowest levels to learn 
and discuss composition of struc- 
ture; or, if relationships, we all 
speculated and formed hypotheses. 

Those who advanced the most 
novel conjecture — determined by 
majority vote — which also fitted 
consistently within the framework 
of past “accepted” conjectures, 
won. 

Though I could not play this 
game until I was five Enithra years 
old, the first day I played I won. 
This caused much surprise to all 
— Spork the moron, won! 

One of the children had selected 
as a particular relationship a tri- 
angle drawn upon the dirt floor of 
the jungle. It had one right angle. 

While all busied themselves in 
sensing the relationship of lines to 
lines and angles to angles while tiy^- 
ing to generate new conjectures, I 
walked up to the triangle and drew 
a square along each side using the 
sides of the triangles as one of the 
sides of each square. It seemed 
quite obvious to me that the sum 



76 



IF 




of the areas of the two small 
squares was equal to the area of 
fit big square^ and 1 said so to the 
others. 

They decked and re^ecked 
this hypothesis — then finally 
agreed to the worth of my conjec- 
ture. 

How big I felt on that dayl 

Usually though, speculation in- 
volved some object. Since I could 
seldom extend my tdekmass sen- 
s(w lower than molecular levels, I 
seldom ccHijectiured much that was 
new or novd .... 

C ouds formed on the right side 
of my valley, now hiding the 
sun, I prepared another of the veg- 
etable growths for cover, found 
food which I carried back to my 
hiding place and composed my 
mind on my tedious wait. 

How useless all those games 
were to the Ayorian children, I 
thou^t. They were designed to 
train them in self-protection from 
Tqpen. But they were miserable 
failures. 

The clouds overhead now grew 
faster than the valley’s puffballs 
could consume th^, as they free- 
ly floated in search of minute par- 
ticles of air, moisture and other 
nutrients. Water dropped from 
them. 

I had often been exposed t<]l 
rain. I didn’t mind it Always be- 
fore I could tdeport the water 
away from my i^in u fast as the 



rain dropped. But now, without 
the use of my indirect faculties, 
the water soon soaked me, making 
me even more miserable. 

To mature toward twinning, 
each individual Ayorian must de- 
velop new and novd philosophical 
q>eculations about reality. Now, 
crouching in the heavy rains, grov- 
eling beneath the dead organic skin 
which provided me with some 
warmth, hiding beneath the heavy 
grief wWch was still mine, I almost 
smiled. I was thinking of how 
many philosophical games I could 
now win with what I had learned 
of direct-action effectsl 

But all these things were unim- 
portant, compared to my need to 
avenge Erne’s death! 

When I woke, late on the next 
morning, I was exhausted and stiff 
from exposure to the cold and wet. 
The sun was already above the val- 
Iqr’s peaks, raising steamy tendrils 
from last night’s rain. 

What water was left unused by 
Enithra’s jungle life now flowed in 
tiny rivulets all over the valley. 
The waterfall behind which I 
crouched thundered louder, with a 
thousand new fountains fanning 
out wider and thicker from every 
splattering ledge. 

I moved closer against the rocky 
backdrop, trying to avoid the great- 
er water-spra}^, to no avafl. My 
vegetable covering was now pitted 
and holed by the telekinetic ac- 
ti(Hi of Eniriira’ life during the 



SPOMC OF THE AYOR 



77 




night It offered little protection. 

After securing new covering and 
filling my empty stomach I re- 
turned to my watching post My 
thoughts, as usual, returned to the 
evil Tepen and their source. 

TTundreds of thousands of years 
earlier, the Tepen and Ayor 
had been one tribe. During the 
time of twinning of some long foiv 
gotten Ayorian, his philosophical 
twinning problem involved specu- 
lation on the ^‘purpose” of mate- 
rial things. He solved his twinning 
problem with the conjecture that 
material tilings were to be used “di- 
rectly’^ — that is, without use of 
one’s telekmass ^ilities — rather 
than “indirectly” as would be the 
case with use of these two abilities. 

His children followed this nat- 
ural line of speculation. From then 
to the present day, each of his de- 
scendants solved Ms twinning prob- 
lems within the consistent frame- 
work of those assumptions. They 
separated from the Ayor, develop- 
ed a material science and an urban 
society. 

Unfortunately, as thdr capadty 
for directly using material things 
grew, their capacity for mass sens- 
ing and teleportation declined. As 
these capacities declined, their phil- 
osopMcal sense of ri^tness and 
wrongness degenerated. They gave 
up groupings in favor of a single, 
all-pow^ful leader and a distorted, 
evil drive toward mastering thdr 



environment through direct means. 

Capacity for tdekmass changed 
to a sense of a different kind. Each 
Tepen was surrounded at twinning 
with complex mechanical equip- 
ment responding directly to hb 
mental command. Their shells con- 
tained clever energy fidds capable 
of resisting the planet’s life forms 
and their ever-present telekinetic 
tug. 

Different, more ingenious ener- 
gy fields were devdoped to catch 
other life forms. These captures 
^e placed into huge machines 
wMch ground them into proper size 
and separated out thdr chemical 
constituents. The results were in- 
jected as nourishment into the 
machinery surounding each Tep- 
en. 

My first contact with the Tepefi 
came when we children chased 
“tree” nuts. 

As each tree teleported its ripen- 
ed seed away, hopefully to land in 
a region of nourishment within the 
capability of its feeble sensing ap- 
paratus, we would spring after the 
seed. First to find the nut was free 
to use it for his own nourishment. 

How delicious th^ were! 

On that day we had all sensed 
the quickened ripening of one seed. 
It was ready for a quick journey. 
We tensed, ready to spring after it 
ho matter wMdi way it flew. 

The nut ripened, q>rang fromi 
bur location, then disappeared from 
everyone’s tdekmass sensors — 

IF 



78 




mudi to the surprise of everyone. 

Ovef was far the best of us in 
the game of “hide^d-seek”. He 
found the nut first . ^ . but he also 
distqipeared from our sensing net- 
work We searched long and dili- 
gently for Ovct 

I was the lucky — I should say 
imlucky — member that found 
him. 

■C'loating in the middle of a jun- 
gle clearing was a huge cage. 
I bad never seen anything like It 
befwe. It was surrounded by pul- 
sating energy fields which cycled 
from low infra-red throng ultra- 
virfet. 

As I watched the unusual dis- 
I^y, I could see Ovef’s small, now 
shrunken form reflected ba(£ to 
me each time the energy field 
passed fiirough its ultra-violet se- 
quence. 

ThMi I noticed the nut. Some- 
how, diabolically, it had been 
drawn far beyond its normal range 
to land in the energy trap. Ovef, 
being the strongest, had sensed it 
and followed. And he, in turn, bad 
tripped the energy fields which 
now contained him. 

As soon as the other Ayorian 
children found us, without excep- 
tion, they shouted “Tepenl” Then 
just as quickly tdeported them- 
sdves away. 

Having no Rouping experience 
upon which to build my own fear 
of Tepen, I was not to be dissuaded 



so easily. I hid from sight and 
waited. Our past conjecture games 
had taught me the Tepoi used 
traps triggered by use of <me’s own 
telekmass faculties. So, I hid, us- 
ing only my usually useless light 
receptors and other direct-action 
faculties — just as I was now doing 
high on this ledge. 

I kept my eyes on the terrified 
Ovef. 

When evening came I heard the 
Tepen approach, their floating 
suit-tanks scraping agdnst En- 
ithra foliage. Ug^y protrusions of 
direct-action machinery cover- 
ed the Tq>en’s metal suit-convey- 
ances ever^here. 

No wonder Erne suspected my 
arrival vessell It must have looked 
just like a trap of Tq)enl I thought, 
staring at the mechanical assem- 
blages . 

Though they nn^e much noise 
whQe talking, and thoug|h the noises 
sounded mudi like the Ayorian 
language, I could not understand 
them. 

One turned a small knob on the 
outside of his metal suit. The dif- 
fereit colors surrounding Ovef 
changed to a steady ultra-violet. I 
could see him crouch back terri- 
fied. Another Tepen unloosed a 
small photocell which sou^t out 
Ovef, then steadied on him. I later 
learned that this small photocell 
had pi(hed up Ovef’s ultra-violet 
reflections, then transmitted the re- 
turned energy to a form which 



SPORK OF THE AYOR 



79 




could be easfly sensed by the 
atrophied mass-sensor of the Tep- 
en. 

As soon as the photocell steadied 
on Ovef, the Tepen produced a 
hose, which sprang from a complex 
cubical box. He pointed it directly 
at Ovef. An intense light beam 
poured forth from the top half of 
the hose and an energy stream 
came back from Ovef to flow 
through the lower half of the hose 
into the box. 

I saw Ovef shrink and puff 
apart, as though he were as tenu- 
ous as one of the puffballs which 
suddenly disint^rate after their 
air is teleported from inside. 

The Tepen turned off the cor- 
usucating energies around the cage 
and reset the trap. Then the three 
quietly floated away from the clear- 
ing in the opposite direction from 
where I was hiding. 

I didn’t follow them that day. 
Oh, how I wished I might have 
had the wisdom, the knowledge, the 
courage and the maturity to have 
done so. Erne might even now be 
alive if I had. 

^^his day of waiting was very 
^ much like the other days — 
hot, uncomfortable, and full of 
pain for both body and mind. Puff- 
balls lofted above and floated 
ever5^here. The predatory Ettel 
consumed its share of stupid Qens. 
The waterfall flowed on, though 
now decreased somewhat in size 



and noise; and the Tqpen cages 
continued to tantalize me be- 
low . « • • 

I remembered when I was twelve 
Enithra years old. life until then 
had been one long agony of at- 
tempts to overcome my handicaps. 
I couldn’t mass-sense any better 
than the least of the young. I 
couldn’t teleport much better. I did 
have some little advantage on ab- 
stract relationships. But I couldn’t 
go below the chemical level in 
mass-sensing, nor could I reach be- 
yond a forty-mile radius. 

I lost in every game; I was the 
moron. 

Yet I often wondered what it 
was about me which, unBke other 
children, enabled me to watch Tep- 
en from hiding? Was this to be 
my twinning problem — as I was 
still Erne’s? And, if solved, would 
I then twin to become two help- 
less, moronic children? 

Life continued its pastoral flav- 
or. We moved. We played games. 
Once each year the grouping oc- 
curred — without me — and twin- 
ing occured sporadically here 
and there as one or another A3ror- 
ian individual reached his philo- 
sophical plateau. 

Though life continued the same 
for all the other children, it was 
different for me. How could Ayor- 
ians live so carefree when their 
very Eves were endangered by Tep- 
ens? I wondered time and again. 

When I asked the adults this 

IF 



80 




question, tbdr only answer was, 
^‘This must be your twinning {oob- 
lon. You are stOl a chfld in many 
ways. But maybe, for you, twin- 
ning comes early.” 

How could a small animal-like 
child, as I was, make any impres- 
sion on tbdr conq>lacen(y? 

I know now that Ayms have no 
sense of hatred or revenge as I do. 
My emotions are probably doser 
akin to the evil Tepen than to the 
Ayor. 

Each game became for me a 
philosophical vessd within whidi 
to fa^on the fabric of Tep- 
en revenge for Ovefs death. Each 
abstract conjecture was turned over 
and over in my mind to find some 
handle allowing me revenge. 

Still I did nothing any different 
from the other children. Not yet 
could I be stirred to actually change 
my cultural behavior pattern. 

T He day Erne was caught was 
beautiful to view witii light 
receptors. She and I were dowly 
teleporting through this beautiful 
valley, so covered with flowers of 
all kinds. I remember commenting 
to Eme on how much I wished die 
could see the brilliant array of col- 
ors with light reciters like mine. 
Her comment was typical — how 
much she wished I could sense the 
tieautiful energy levek operating 
below my thrediold level in the 
flowers 1 

I described for her how one 



ticular flower slowly amassed bun- 
dles of red and green nodes as it 
reached seed maturity. I had to 
use Ayorian energy wavdength di- 
mendons in my descripticm, in- 
stead of color names; so I diink 
the visual impact was not truly ap- 
predated by her. Yet I was so anx- 
ious for her to share my sensitiv- 
ities that I forged ahead. 

I told hsx how each red and 
green node swelled up to form S 
hemisidierical dot which aligned it- 
self among others like it to fmm an 
unusually beautiful pattern. 

Then, as eadt dark red node 
teleport^ at maturity, a shifting, 
changing pattern ai^)eared. The 
background blue of tte flower-pod 
suddenly showed in place of the 
dark-red seed. Now one could see 
the shifting blues, reds and greens 
weaving over and oyer into capti- 
vating patterns. 

While I was trying to describe 
to Eme what I could view with 
li^t receptors, I remember also 
seeing a row of the rounded diape 
of the Cien, a rather dinnb animal. 
They were teleporting debris of all 
kinds to their stomachs, without 
regard to food-value or type — 
just as thqr were now doing below 
me. Usually th^ continued tills 
rather engorging bdiavior until 
their stomadi howled with protest, 
after which thqr Then, on 

awakening, they repeated thdr 
senseless qrde of satiation and 
pain.

The predatory Ettd corild be 
seen tdeporting from hummock to 
hummock behind the rovr of Gen. 
One Gen disa{^)eared and Erne and 
I both could sense its rqq)earance 
in the stomach of the Ettd. The 
other Gen continued their placid 
Muttony unconcerned. 

We came to the end' of this val- 
ley surrounded on all sides by 
steep, sweeping dieer diffs. I was 
about to tel^Knrt to the top of one 
large diff when Erne ^tted the 
trap. Perhaps Erne was getting old 
and cardess. More Ukdy, her twin- 
ning problem was heavy on her 
mind. 

She made the error of assuming 
the trap was simply what it appear- 
ed to be. 9ie carefully cautioned 
me to stOlness while ^e searched 
^th ho* mind for the trap’s outer 
boundaries. 

Another trap, set just for this 
fcontingency, caught her mass-sens- 
ing probe and spnmgl It drew her 
to it and dosed with the same 
polyi^dic field I had seen en- 
dosing Ovef. Her voice screamed 
to me... then was suddenly cut 
off. 

I expected the trap to behave 
just like the one I had seen around 
Ovef. But this time the Tepen had 
placed a killing device inside. The 
energy field passed finrough the 
ultra-violet, and I could see Erne 
wither and dissipate as the ray of 
energy passed through her body. 

I raged with mixed anger and 

SPORK OF THE AYOR 



grief. I struck at the trap with my 
bare hands. Wil<fly, See some sti^id 
Gen, I threw ddnis at the machine 
— to no avaO. 

Then, in total exhaustion, I 
droiq>ed to the gioimd, my 
rece^rs strangely ' letting forth 
streams of liquid while my dtest 
heaved breathlesdy. 

Erne was gonel I tras alone. 

Of an the Ayor,*oidy I would 
seek her revenge, I knew. When 
sanity returned to me, I carefully 
searched around both traps — 'Bot 
with my mind, but with my body. 
I actuafiy used my 1^ and arms to 
Walk, physicaUy, around each trap. 
In my mixture of aoga and grief, 
I perceived the philosophical prin- 
ciples which could be tested only 
by me — not the Ayof' — that these 
traps would be tri|^^ only by 
mind energyl 

Gtrefufiy, theii, I Walked around 
each trap. Tentetivdy, ready to 
draw back instantly, I held my 
hand around the sustaining fidd. 
I could feel only the normd pluck 
of mass-sensing fingers from the 
forest in the background. 

Then, as my hand passed phy- 
sically through the net, whatever 
readual mind energy existed in 
the cdls of my mm triggered the 
trap. My arm felt pulled inward 
toward the center of the trap WUIe 
my body tensed muscles in the 
<^poate direction, easdy conqua- 
ing the pull. 

An around the iadde of the trap 

83 




I moved my ann tmfil I came to tlie 
back ef aaother of the death-ray 
devices With something solid to 
grasp, I dosed my Hngers and 
pulled it toward me. It came easily 
and I crushed it imder foot. 

My hand came to the container 
from which the telekinetic field 
emanated. I reached for a heavy 
rock, and with my hands I raised 
the rock over my head and crushed 
the box flat. When I had done the 
same to the other trap, I searched 
the area carefully for any sign of 
Erne. 

Only a thin residue of dust bore 
witness to her once beloved pres- 
ence. 

Many hours of philosophical con- 
jecturing with the children had 
sharpened my mind insofar as re- 
lationships were concerned. Though 
I was a moron to the Ayor and their 
children, I knew now, without 
«iuivocation, that only I was cap- 
able of handling the relationships 
imposed by the Tepen. These were 
of an order of abstraction foreign to 
the Ayor. 

But not to me. 

Also, it seemed somehow a sweet 
kind of justice that I, who was 
Erne’s twinning problem, should 
carry on h&r twinning goals — ^What 
am I? What is my purpose in life? 
And I now consciously, deliberately 
accepted ha: twinning problem as 
my own. 

In the pseudo-clearness of 
thoughts genarated from my grief 



and now by my terrible anger, I 
could almost sense the end ibat 
^ould have been Erne’s to observe, 
to enjoy, and to use in raising her- 
self b^ond her own philosophical 
limitations resulting, thereby, in the 
evolutionary necessity and pleasures 
of twinning. 

But not quite — not quite! Much 
yet — too much — had to be done 
and learned! 

'^he next night I dreamed again. 
^ The ledge was somewhat 
wider now because of the decrease 
in size of the waterfall. But I was 
wearying. I held myself in a tight 
ball to keep from falling off the 
hundred-foot ledge. In my hands 
and aroxmd my legs were twisted 
new strands of vegetable growth, 
tied to the Tepen traps below, 
ready to warn me should the Tepen 
return at night. 

I dreamed that Erne was alive 
again — only ten times larger. My 
child-like form grew to her size, 
then went beyond until she ap- 
peared no more than fist-size. I 
reached for her, swallowed her, then 
began to sense her expanding form 
inside my body. 

Tighter and tighter she became 
until every cell of my body con- 
tained a part of Erne. When the 
pressure released I felt good over 
all my body. 

Afterward, I slept deeply and 
comfortably for the first time since 
Erne’s death .

m 

T ike shiny, tiny glow-light in- 
sects, teleporting here and there, 
now strong, then gone, the T^n’s 
body-suit reflected electro-magne- 
tic radiation from the sun as it 
weaved its way in and out of 
Enithra’s thick foliage. Unlike any 
ether moving object in the valley, 
these tiny sparks moved continu- 
eusly — contrasting greatly with 
the normal Enithra stop-and-go 
modes of locomotion. 

There were seven sparks. In my 
imagination I could once again view 
the monstrosities which had attack- 
ed Ovef so long ago — metallic 
jacket, oval in shape; many me- 
chanical protrusions of unlmown 
functions attached to their protec- 
tive suits; each floating above the 
groimd as high as my knee, bring- 
ing their tops to about shoulder 
height. 

My mind raced, my muscles 
tightened and I placed every effort 
of my physical, emotional and men- 
tal makeup into the concentrated 
task of watching Tepen. I was close 
to avenging Erne’s death. 

At their slow, lumbering pace, 
half the day passed before they 
reached their traps. Then they 
rushed from one trap to the other 
and back again. Excitedly they 
made their Ayorian-Iike but in- 
comprehensible noises to one an- 
other. 

I rolled a heavy rock to the edge 



of my hiding place overhead. As 
one Tepen neared the base of the 
cBff directly below me, I dropped 
it direcAly on top of him and his 
machinery. I coidd see his yellow- 
ish fluid ooze between the crushed 
metallic membranes of his suit 

I had conjectured that since, ex- 
cept for themselves, their total en- 
vironment was made up of life 
forms capable of only indirect 
action, not once would they think 
to focus their mechanical light cells 
upward in search of another direct- 
action being. Apparently I was 
right 

Quockly now they unlimbered an 
odd-lookiiig box. Nervously they be- 
gan turning and adjusting its con- 
trols. I dropped another rock. 

The five remaining increased 
their efforts with the machinery. 
I placed myself in their position 
and imagined what their chain of 
reasoning must be: If someone 
were teleporting rocks on them, 
their protective machinery in the 
traps, which normally sensed tele- 
kinetic fields then took protective 
action, was not working. Further- 
more, no purpose would be achieved 
by fleeing from their hidden ene- 
mies, No conceivable escape speed 
could possibly outdistance tele- 
ported objects. 

I counted on such thinking on 
their part as I dropped yet a third 
rock. The yellow fluids gushed 
forth from another of the evil 
Tepen.

A polyordic lig^t surrounded 
their mechanioal assemblage as the 
remahiiiig four murderers activated 
its field. loeide this spectacular 
diq>lay, marldhig off the limits of 
th^ aevr telddnetic feld, floated 
the four reuMuniog Tepen. At their 
head, aimed at the exact center of 
the surrounding barriar, sat another 
of (he automatic death rays which 
had killed Eme. 

Croudiing back further from the 
edge the ledge, with only the 
tep of my head and my ti^t 
reoq>tms pe^ng over, I gave 
thought to this new Tepen course 
of action. As (he nut-tree seed had 
beea caught aa soon as its tel^in- 
etic Add had been activated, and 
as Ovef had been cau^t for the 
same reason, I believed that the 
T^>en had established a dmilar 
trap. Were I to exmdse my own 
iniffirect facidties I would surely 
be instantly tdqrarted to the cen- 
ter of the tr:^ — where the death 
ray would destroy me. 

I could, of course, continue to 
dn^ ro<±3 on (he Tepen with UQf 
arm muscles. But, if I did, they 
wotdd sooner or later learn about 
my use of direct faculties. Then 
th^ Would probably be capable of 
takhog couBleiMiction against me. 
Sfoce I couldn’t kill more than one 
at a time by this means, the risk 
was too great. 

Fhrtiiermore, did I want to let 
Tepen everywhere learn bf my 
pecidhur abifilfes? And were these 



seven to be the end of my revenge 
for Erne’s sake? I thought notl For 
my kind of revenge, seven Tepen 
loould not satisfy the 

emptiness of my spirit I 
sensed, thou;^ only immaturely as 
yet, need for more knowledge and 
a greater campaign against these 
hereditary Ayorian enemies. 

T he sun slowly approached eve- 
ning-line as both the Tepen and 
I patiently wdted in our deadly 
game. For some time each of the 
Tepen rotated his photocells in all 
directions of the compass. Finally, 
tiring of this profitless task — none 
ever thought to point his photocell 
up in my direction— <th^ hung 
the cells back on thdr protective 
suits unused. 

My plan was Weil formulated 
now. I descended along the water- 
fall out of their posdble hue of 
until, reaching their level, I 
was well hidden behind the final 
Und largest fountain of falling 
water. 

I cirded qtdetly behind the rear 
bf tto water-spray, finding add- 
itional screen from thick growing 
trees. Further bqrond, well hidden 
from the Tepen lineH)f-sight, sat 
3 row of Giens. One was asleep. 
This one I grabbed with my arm 
muscles, carefully transporting it 
directly behind the foliage near the 
fomr Tepen trappers. 

I reasoned tfoit sooner or later 
the Cien's indiscriminate appetite 

IF

would cause a piece of material to 
follow a telekinetic line beginning 
with its source, throu^ the field 
of the Tepen trap and ending in 
Its huge stomach. When the Gen’s 
telekinetic field readied forth to 
seize its prey, the Tepen trap would 
automatically pull it in — just as 
it bad for the tree nut and for 
Ovef end for Erne. The Tepen 
death ray at the center of the trap 
Would automatically and nearly in- 
stantaneously destroy the Gen. I 
hoped the Tepen would condude 
that their Ayorian enemy had been 
killed. 

Back again on my ledge over- 
looking both the Tepens and the 
sole Gen, I waited for its awaken- 
ing. When it came, the sun had 
reached its lowest point before dis- 
appearing for the day. As with all 
Cien, it opened its huge stomach 
sack to receive all manner of or- 
ganic and inorganic materials for 
possible nourishment — an 3 dhing at 
all which was within its sphere of 
telekinetic strength. 

I could almost feel the Tepens’ 
jubilation over their success when 
the Gen was caught and instantly 
disintegrated. They talked to one 
another in their strange Ayorian- 
like gabble as they disassembled 
equipment and turned back across 
the valley floor in the same direc- 
tion from which they had come 
early in the morning. 

The sun was half below the 
horizon as I dipped from stone to 



stone down the w^ to follow them. 

The remaining Tepen advanced 
steadily toward the valley’s 
side, never once turning photocell 
to the rear. Wi&in a matter of 
minutes 1 readied the traiEng 
Tepen. I dubbed it to death with 
a broken brands 

The dusk li^t vanished. The 
Tepen forged ahead before me, 
bobbing, weaving and floating, 
each in a sphere of radiated light. 
Where they floated above the 
broken valley floor, I had to scram- 
ble and push and tug around many 
formerly minor obstades. My mus- 
des, nowhere near used to this un- 
usual punishment, ached wifli dull 
pains of growth and sharp pin- 
pricks of over-use. 

As their li^t-cndrcled bodies 
floated easily the valley’s steep 
banks, I nearly weakened in my 
resolve not to use indirect faculties. 

I could easily catch up by a 
small use of teleportation. But I 
dared not. I knew that other Ayor- 
ians, far above me in the use of 
indirect faculties, were falling to 
still unknown, hidden Tepen traps 
that used thdr own superiority 
against them. 

Eventually exhausted and crying 
from the fibers of every one of my 
muscle filaments, I reached the 
steep rim overlooking the vaBey 
beyond. There, deceptively dose in 
the dark, was the object of the 
Tepen’s travels. 

Glittering li^ts shone from the 



SPORK OF THE AYOR

floor of the valley^ dustered in 
near circular form. Many lights 
sparkled like teleporting fireflies as 
iSxey moved from point to point in 
the dark. The cool breeze blew 
jungle foliage back and forth be- 
tween the lights and us. 

This sight of my first Tq>en vil- 
lage fully explained the avoidance 
of certain areas by my fellow 
Ayorians, 

T forced air into my laboring lungs 
by forcing the expansion and 
contraction of my weak chest mus- 
cles. Then, taking a calculated risk, 
I rushed down the valley floor, 
ignoring noise and the possibility 
of discovery though direct sight. 

I slowed to a fast walk, taking 
more time to push organic ma- 
terials away from my direct path of 
approach as I neared the closest 
moving light. Within the Tepen’s 
light-circle I could see his photo- 
cell pointed away from me, as with 
the otha: Tepen, I struck him down 
with some elation. Only two to go! 

When the next rearmost member 
fdl as easily, we were better than 
halfway across the valley floor to 
the Tepen village. 

I ai^roached the last unsuspect- 
ing Tepen close onou^ to strike 
when my mind presented me with 
a novel conjecture. I could make 
this Tq)en teach me what I must 
knowl 

Fortunatdy for myself and the 
other Aymlans, I gave little thought 



to potentially dangerous devices 
available to the Tepen^s conscious 
defense and unknown to me. Pos- 
sibly poisons from my muscular 
over-exertions clouded my thinking. 

Dropping behind the remaining 
T^en, I drew upon my mental 
images of one of the children’s early 
conjectures. Quickly reconstructing 
their concept, I re-created the sys- 
tem of forces of their speculations 
by hand. I tied two stones to the 
end of a long vine and began whirl- 
ing it around and around over my 
head. When I could feel both of the 
stones pulling against the muscles 
of my arm, I let the whole system 
of forces fly at the floating Tepen. 

It whizzed around and around 
his body, successfully tangling most 
of his outer instruments. 

I jumped on his suit, adding my 
weight to the total assemblage, then 
grabbed at his photocell and jerked 
it off. 

As the combined weight of my 
body and the rocks exceeded the 
telekinetic capacity of his protec- 
tive suit, we settled to the valley 
floor. 

I kept my legs wrapped around 
the Tepen’s suit. I reached for 
vines near us, using them to more 
completely entangle the captive. 
Then I broke off all of his suit’s 
sensory jMrotruberances. 

This Tepen had the trap-box 
with its death-ray attachment I 
slung the trap-box over one shoul- 
der and, using the end of one trail-

ing vine, tugged the monster along 
the valley floor in the opposite 
rection from the Tepen village. 

We traveled most of that night 
and the next, using only my pow- 
ers of direct action. 

'Y^elekmass faculties had always 

-*■ made my search for food and 
water a minor task. Now, using on- 
ly my direct faculties, I found the 
diore far more time consuming. In 
a valley far away frmn the Tepen^s 
point of capture, along a stream 
whose banks were lined with edi- 
ble food, I took the precaution of 
tying every protruberance on the 
Tepen’s covering machinery with 
live vines bound to sturdy trees. 

In view of the fact that I hadn’t 
bothered to respond to the Tepen’s 
noises, that it couldn’t “see” with- 
out its photocell and that it couldn’t 
mass-sense or teleport beyond the 
confines of its own mechanical pro- 
tective suit, it must have been very 
puzzled indeed, 

I set the death ray next to him, 
carefully pointing it away from us. 
By changing control knobs and ob- 
serving effects, I was able to learn 
how it operated. Then I turned it 
back toward my captive, plugged 
his photocell back into his suit of 
machinery and pointed the death 
ray directly at him. Finally, I tied 
his body to my foot with a long 
vine and sl^t. 

The Tepen did not move all that 
night 



When I awoke, the sun was well 
overhead. The air was cool and 
slightly misty. I ate and drank — 
the hard way — then turned back 
to my captive. 

When his photocell was moved 
to include me in its vision, I point- 
ed it at my finger, which was hdd 
near the death-ray switch, I made 
motions with my finger, pretending 
to switch the death ray on. 

Even a stupid Cien could get 
that messagel 

I moved its photocell to cover 
me and said, “SporkI” Then I 
moved the cell to the stream of 
water, using Ayorian terms to say 
“water.” 

The beast and I learned. Its 
language was rooted in the Ayor- 
ian tongue, though concepts were 
structured around material things 
rather than philosophical ideas. I 
am sure that without the peculiar 
characteristics of my sensory net- 
work — light and sound receptors, 
etc. — I would have had as much 
difficulty learning its language as 
would any other Ayorian, Most 
nouns had concrete referents which 
I could point to, merely by moving 
his photocell from object to object. 

I don’t mean to imply that I was 
unusually bright It was just that 
my Bmited capabilities happened to 
match the Tepen better than they 
did the other Ayor. 

Tn a matter of weeks I was 
able to converse with my cap-

tive, tbou|^ haltiitgly. 1 learned 
wbere his fooid bos was located, al- 
lowmg it to t^ whatever nourish- 
ment needed. As his food de- 
creased, his rage would sometimes 
bo3 over; im, 13:e me, he could 
preface anger. Then I would learn 
thinp which I am sure it had no 
initial intention of communicating 
— Ifte tte novd idea that messages 
could be sent from him to his far- 
distant village. 

I Aut off its photocdl and de- 
nied it food until it taught me 
about the form of electromagnetic 
radiation which could bounce 
around the planet very n^idly. 

It took me somewhat longer to 
learn tiiat one of the metallic suit 
protrosioas, whidi I had already 
luckily broken, bad been, con- 
structed for the purpose of sending 
such messages. 

Even though I now felt confi- 
dent that I could separate its lies 
from its truthful statements, I 
moved to a further valley and kept 
even more careftd watch for search- 
ing Tepen. 

Months passed while I learned 
not only the language, but the 
function and Bmitation of every 
one of the sint’s appendages. Some 
were for grasping objects, others 
for plugging into equipment found 
only in their vi&ige or larger cities. 
Some were spedal puix>ose protru- 
sions whose functions were related 
to the trapping of Aycnian life. It 
was this latter feature which g^ve 



me the most difticulty, and about 
which I wanted the most informa- 
tion. 

As day followed day, I reflected 
ever more frequently on how dif- 
ficult it would be to kill the Tq>en, 
without motive, so to speak. As my 
ability to communicate increased, 
a certain empathy grew between 
us. Can anyone ^ anotii^ being 
xmder such conditions? I wonder- 
ed often. 

Then I learned the Tepen pur- 
pose for trapping my Ayorian 
brothers and toe intended purpose 
of Erne’s death. As toe death-ray 
tube worked on Erne, the return 
enagy given off by her death was 
collected and trapped in side at- 
tachments. 

Thdr sole motive in so captur- 
ing this peculiar life-energy was in 
toe sensory pleasures its rdease 
gave them. Just as I considered the 
meat of the nut tree to be a ddi- 
cacy worthy of expending time and 
energy to obtain, the Tepen consid- 
ered Ayorian life a delicacy worthy 
of toe search and death of their 
fomor ancestor. How depraved toe 
Tqpen had becomel 

When every drop of knowledge 
'ms squeezed from toe Tepen, now 
finding it anotionally easy to kill, 
I pushed a toarp stick through 
opoiings in its armor. Then, using 
my indirect faculties for toe first 
time in months, I teleported toe 
dead organic mass out of toe ar- 
mor.

I studied the suit piece by piece, 
putting into play the many hours 
of philosophit^ conjecturing I had 
practiced :ivith my playmates. 
There ms not much about the 
machinery jrhich I did not learn, 
for BOW I had no fear of using all 
of my senses, including mass-sens- 
ing and teleportation. 

T manipulated the machinery with 
my mind, and I also doubled 
my body inside the suit, di- 
recting it to move from potet to 
point. It was imcomfortable, but 
possible. So long as I trigger^ no 
mind traps, I could be free to move 
within their village should the need 
arise — that is, assuming they did 
not notice the small light receptor 
holes which I had created in the 
suit — and assuming I actually un- 
derstood as much about the Tepen 
as I thou^t I didi

'^hough, I, Spork, the Ayorian 
‘ moron, determined to become 
Spork, the Ayorian avenger, I was 
not so stupid as to think I could 
yet imitate the Tepen in their own 
village. Furthermore their village 
was but a tiny ou4>ost of their com- 
plete civilization. Time and chance 
had caused the number of Tepen 
to be approximately equal to ^t 
of the Ayoe — nearly one hundred 
thousand each. 

I needed to convince the Ayor 
SPOWC OF THE AYOR 



of their need for eliminating Tepen 
before we Ayors were all hunted 
down and killed. As yon will im- 
mediately know from what I have 
said of my foster race, this was to 
be a most difficult task. 

Even more difficult was the 
problem of just how an Ayor could 
kill a Tepen, even if he so desired. 
The. only abilities native to Ayor- 
ian life were the indirect faculties 
which Tepen used against theml 

The time of Ayorian grouping 
had arrived. There I h(^ed to 
make my plea, and so I teleported 
the death ray, the empty Tepen 
suit and myself to the place of 
gathering, a good five miles below 
the surface of Enithra. Even Tep- 
en direct-action technology could 
not go this deep — yeti 

As the Ayor arrived for the gath- 
ering, they arranged themselves in- 
to their new patterns of polarity. 
Their line curved along tiie top of 
the immense cavern and seemed to 
throb with intense philosophical 
thou^t, as their individual mes- 
sages contributed to total racial 
growtii. 

As usual, they ignored Spork, the 
moron. Using my indirect facul- 
ties, I filled the huge cavern with 
sufficient air from the planet’s sur- 
face, so that sound waves could be 
formed. Then, with a loud voice, 
I shouted, “Listen, fellow Ayori- 
ansl I have discovered many new 
things about the Tepen which all 
must diare.” 



91 




Unable to break their chain, the 
Ayor i^ke back in unison, one 
himdred thousand strong. “What 
can Spork, the diild, contribute?” 

From the fonn of their response 
I knew I had met with great pes- 
simism. In the adult mind, I was 
yet a child because of my obvious 
limitations. “I am as a diild Ayor- 
ian, but am not a child for me,” I 
responded. “Hear me out. Can the 
Ayor escape the Tepen traps? I 
can I Can the Ayor kill the Tepen? 
I have! Can the Ayor talk the Tep- 
en language? I can! Should I say, 
then, that all other Ayor are chil- 
dren because they cannot do these 
things which I can?” 

This thought, as I knew, was ori- 
ginal and novel to my brothers. 
Their interest and respect had 
been aroused, so I pushed my ad- 
vantage. I explained how their 
“squeezing” and “null-thought” 
games were useless — indeed, 
worse than useless, for the very act 
of protecting one’s self with such 
mental energy activated Tepen 
traps. 

I demonstrated the death ray 
and Tepen suit; I explained the 
depraved purpose of the energies 
taken from dying Ayors and I told 
of my experience in killing Tepen, 
concluding with the logical appeal 
that all Tq>en must be killed every- 
where. 

'^his became the longest grouping 
in the history of the Ayor. 



There was much new to learn, dis- 
cuss and i^are. I had upset some 
of the most cheri^ed attitudes 
found among my brethren, and 
they knew me to be truthful. 

They had need to re-structure 
their complete phibsophical con- 
cepts. Weeks passed while they 
weighed, assessed and evaluated 
each concept. 

I felt I was winning my main 
point — and so I dM, but in a way 
very much different than I sup- 
posed. 

First, they abolished the squeez- 
ing and null-thought games. They 
were to be replaced by another 
called “non-sensing” which was to 
be played very much like the null- 
thought game. This, they felt, 
would give the children practice in 
not triggering Tepen traps. 

I tried to explain they were talk- 
ing “nonsense” with their new 
“non-sensing” game . but got 
nowhere. 

Second, they abolished the nut 
game to avoid traps of the kind 
which had killed Ovef. 

I tried to explain that Tepen 
would make other traps and other 
ways of accomplishing the same ob- 
jective. They were little concerned. 
They felt that, statistically, it was 
improbable the Tepen could harm 
the Ayorian race very badly. 

I didn’t try to explain my idea 
of the need for Ayorian revoke, 
since this concept would have been 
completely foreign to their nature.

Yet I tried to describe the great 
loss to the Ayorian race when in- 
dividuals such as Erne were pre- 
vented from completing their twin- 
ning problem. 

This only brought the response 
I had heard before. ^^That is yowt 
twinning problem. If you are not 
a child, solve itl” 

Thus, Spork the moron became 
Spork the only Ayorian avenger! 

I teleported ba^ to Enithra’s 
surface dong with aU the other Ay- 
orians, my emotions in turmoil over 
their refusal to face what I felt 
was reality. 

Alternately grief-stricken, then 
furious with rage, I moved from 
point to point along the surface 
without thought to my direction or 
purpose to my motion. 

One hundred thousand Tepen 
were too many individual life forms 
for me to wage war against alone, 
I knew. Yet my deep loss over Erne 
and my non-Ayorian vow to seek 
revenge burned deeply. 

T^ventually, almost by accident, 
^ I foimd myself in the valley 
where I had been led by the Tepen 
who had killed Erne. There, far 
along the valley’s lu^ violet and 
ultra-violet floor, shone the re- 
flected metal of the Tepen village. 

I teleported myself to a point 
close by the village, then walked 
to its edge with my legs and feet. 
There I physically climbed one of 
the larger trees overlooking some 



of the metallic huts to better ob- 
serve the Tepen activities in se- 
cret 

Had I not known of their com- 
mon genetic heritage I would have 
thought the Tepen and Ayor to be 
totally different races of beings. 
Where the Ayor Kved freely, no- 
madically, across the planet’s sur- 
face, the Tepen built and lived in 
cavelike met^c structures tied to- 
gether by concentric circles of 
metal-like paths that spread out 
from the center of the village. I 
could tell the metallic humps were 
living quarters because the Tepen 
floated along the paths into and 
out of the structures. 

When night came, I retreated 
from the tall branch^ of the tree 
by use of direct action faculties 
and, in similar manlier, filled my 
mouth and stomach with berries 
found on bushes nearby. 

As I ate, I watched ripened ber- 
ries teleport themselves in random 
directions, as was normal for all 
Enithra seed. Since my present in- 
direct sensing faculties were delib- 
erately self-protective only — au- 
tomatically protective against En- 
ithra’s ever-seeking plant and ani- 
mal life — I was incapable of fol- 
lowing any of the berries’ flight 
paths. 

I knew the approximate telepor- 
tation strength of the berries. Thu3 
I knew, within a radius of several 
arm lengths, about where they 
^uld be appealing. Since me of

tile Tepen metal paths ms locate 
jnitiiin the se^’s radius of strength^ 
chance alone I ^uld expect 
the i^pearance of ripened seeds 
scatter^ along the path. 

Ncme could be seen. Nor did any 
appear while !E ate. 

Knowing now that Tepen pro- 
tective devices were operating 
throu^iout the vQlage, I returned 
to my watch above the village with 
even more caution^ 

Nighthdl deepened and artificial 
lighting turned on. Yet, during all 
the long, cold night of watch, noth- 
ing stirred bdow me. At sunrise, 
three Tepm floated toward the vil- 
lage exit, carrying traps and photo- 
cdls. I quickly descended to 
ground leved where I puriied my 
w^ through foliage and fallen jun- 
gle debris to hastily follow than. 

We travel^ for three days, 
rieegmig ni^ts, across five differ- 
ent valleys, l^ore reaching the 
first trap. This time my direct ac- 
tion fatties — my leg and arm 
muscles — were hardened. I had 
no difficulty following behind in 
seaet. 

As they worked over their first 
Ayorian trap, rain tumbled from 
lingering clouds ovahead. As I bad 
learned to do once before, I quick- 
ly covered mysdf with vegetable 
growth to keep off the cold rain 
and to c^ture some heat for my 
body. 

llie rain provided me ^th suf- 
fideot cover so that I could now 



creep doser to the working trio. 
Thdr vdees were dear and I now 
knew thdr language. Stimulated 
and »dted over success in cap- 
turing another Ayorian delicacy, 
they re-set the trap and began 
their slow flotation toward the next 
one. 

When they had gone beyond 
thdr normal seeing distance, I dr- 
ded the re-set trap to study it from 
every angle. There were two of 
them, the same type which had 
caught and killed ^e. 

I could easily trigger them or 
destroy them. I coidd eaaly follow 
the Tepai and destroy every trap 
they set. But what then? Sooner or 
later, Tepen would know of my 
presence. Could I, dngle-handedly, 
kin one hundred thousand T^n? 

But if I let the traps lie un- 
toudieS^ Ayorimi brothers would 
die, one at a time. Even at the risk 
of being discovered by Tq>en, 
could I allow this to happen? 

One tr^ was conspicuous while 
the other was bidden. Both were 
protected from Enitiura’s ever-seek- 
ing life-fingers by tiny, mechani- 
cally generated indirect-action 
fields. Thus they could lie on the 
jtmgle floor indefinitely in wait for 
unwary Ayorians. Whai the Ayor 
sensed the obvious trap and reach^ 
ed to switch it off, the mechani- 
cally generated entrapinng field 
hid^ several feet away was acti- 
vated — and the wary Ayorian to 
be tricky into trafping himsdf.

0 eaching tbrough the trap's tele- 
kinetic barriers physically, I 

pulled away one of t^ two death 
lays. I set it beside the other, 
orienting it in the opposite di- 
rection but hidden low. FMcking 
the switch to the on position, 

1 separated a strand of fiber 
from one of the plant growths 
and tied it to the switch. Then I 
wrapped the other end of the fiber 
to the "off” switch of the other 
ray, and thus set up my Tepen 
trap. 

Carefully, I turned the "off” 
switch "on” — and the strand of 
fiber tugged the "on” ray "off.” 
Since both switches were construc- 
ted the same way, whatever hap- 
pened to one switci caused the other 
to do the opposite 

On their next rounds, the Tepen 
would see the energy field sur- 
rounding an obviously "on” death 
ray. Then, when they extended a 
mechanical appendage to turn it 
off, they would be positioned just 
right to be blasted by the other ray 
as their action tum^ it on. 

I was highly pleased with this 
arrangement. Ayorians might still be 
trapped, but it was not as likely. 
And it was almost certain that in- 
vestigating Tepen would be. With 
heightened aithusiasm, I followed 
behind the Tepen, resetting every 
one of the fourteen traps they 
visited. Sooner or later th^ would 
begin to suspect my presence. But 
I ^s determined to put fear into 



them while they were learning! 

The rain had ceased several days 
earlier. While I was not entirely 
comfortable, I was not cold and wet 
as before. 

'^he three Tepen approached their 
home valley late in the after- 
noon, moving as quickly as their 
mechanical devices would allow. 
One Tepen trailed far behind the 
others, beyond their hearing dis- 
tance. I leaped upon his suit, grasp- 
ing it tightly with both arms and 
legs. I struck first at the long dis- 
tance radio message wire, breaking 
it off while my legs clung to his 
cold, metallic coating. My weight 
prevented it from moving. 

Reaching for jungle vines, I 
quickly tied the waving appendages 
of the struggling Tepen, hoisted him 
to my shoulder and ran into the 
jungle, away from the village, faster 
than any Tepen could follow, until 
I felt myself to be sufficiently far 
away. Then I put the Tepen down 
for a careful surveillance of every 
feature of his suit. I ignored the 
items which were familiar to me and 
broke all those which were unfa- 
mlBar. Once sure that no traps 
could remain hidden in these fea- 
tures, I teleported both of us to a 
distant spot. 

Interrogation of this prisoner 
went swiftly. I drew a design of 
the village on the jungle floor and 
asked for the function and purpose 
of every building. Though the Tep- 

IF 



96 




en £d not ^ye me pcoper answers 
at first, several days of starvation 
broH^t truthful statements. 

I learned the village was one of 
several himdred scattered aroimd 
the planet^s siurface, each having 
file ^ef function of trailing the 
Ayor. I learned the purpose of each 
metal mound — which building was 
their laboratory, whidi was their 
resting quarters and which was their 
long-distance communications cen- 
ter. I knew where the source of 
thdr «iergy was located. And, I 
bdieved, I now knew how to de- 
stroy their villages safely. 

But if I could teleport only forty 
miles per jump, how long would it 
take me, Spork the moron, to find 
several hundred villages scattered 
across the complete planet? Also, 
how could I handle their citadel 
village, where sat their ruler — the 
one for which most of the Ayor 
“delicacies” were being collected? 
At, say, fifty Tepen per village, 
two hundred villages made only ten 
thousand Tepen, I could hope to 
destroy one by one. I would still 
be facing ninety thousand at the 
other main center I 

I continued surveillance of the 
viflage, harrassing its members while 
puzsling over my extra twinning 
problem. Obviously I needed 
Ayorian assistance. Equally ob- 
viously, the other Ayor needed to 
hdp themselves; for, even should 
I be successful in my campaign 
against Tepen, Ayors were still un- 



trained to the art of self-preserva- 
tion. What of the next unpredictr 
bale obstade in their racial prog- 
ress? 

The next captured Tq>en taught 
me about planetary maps and de- 
scribed how Tepen travd swiftly 
from dty to dty merely by stepping 
into the grid of one of the little 
metal mounds. It looked and 
sounded very much like a kind of 
slow, mechanically induced tele- 
portation device. This Tepen start- 
ed the idea which slowly percolated 
upward to my consdouaiess. 

There were exactly forty-two 
members in the village. If I could 
dose off their tran^xartation door 
as well as their means of long- 
distance communication, I believed 
the village would be mine. 

V 

T ate that night I dressed myself 
in one of their mechanical suits 
and slowly made my way to the 
communication center. I inspected 
everything very carefully for traps 
before teleporting chunks of in- 
strument, far away in the jungle. 
Except for a slight tinkling of cer- 
tain materials as my mental shear- 
ing cut through the equipment, all 
was yet quiet. 

I worked my way just as care- 
fully near their transportation door 
where, in the dark, my infra-red 
presence would look to any watch- 
ing Tepen as though I were another

Hepen. Any dose inspedloin mmld 
certainly give me away, however, 
so I depended on their habit of 
ni^tly deep. 

Again I carefully Inspected the 
tran^rtadon device for Tepen 
traps. Emding none, I also tele- 
ported part of this assemblage away 
from tte village. 

Neither communicator nor door 
were any longer operationaL I 
should now find exa^y forty-two 
helpless, or near hdpless, sleeping 
Tepen. 

I quietty counted thdr floating 
figures. Yes, there were exactly 
forty-two floating figures. I un- 
limbered one of thdr death rays 
and sprayed its beam slowly across 
the awa^g figures. Deliberately 
missing one of them, I watched as 
it rushed past me through the door- 
iway. 

The forty-one dead Tepen were 
ho longer a threat As the escaping 
Tepoi ran first to the Transporter, 
then to the commimicator, I tele- 
ported out of the mechanical suit, 
keeping it afloat and active-looking 
with my indirect faculties and 
directing it to follow the Tepen 
overtly while I followed seaetly. 

The stage of damage found on 
both the communicator and trans- 
porter gave the remaining Tq>en 
its due to my nature — ^^at least I 
hoped so. It headed from the use- 
less communicator directly to the 
laboratory, with my empty suit 
trailing behind. 



I made the mechanical tq>pend- 
bge on the suit aiq>ear to open fte 
door and follow it, as my mass 
senang extended throughout the 
tirea sensing his every move. 

It reached for a bulky device, 
swiveling it around to face the 
trailing suit As soon as I sensed 
his appendage reach for the "<m” 
switch, in rapid sequence I mentally 
shoved the empty suit forward to 
distract its attention, teleported a 
large chunk of wall away from the 
building’s side for my own entry, 
damped mental energy on the Tqh 
en’s appoidage to keep it from 
activating the bul^ weapon and, 
with my musde^ jumped through 
the open hole to its side. 

The creature was completely sur- 
prised. My musdes were more than 
suffident match for his mechanical 
linkages. Furthermore, if needed, I 
was now free to use my indirect 
faculties without fear of traps. 

Once it was tightly tied with 
metallic cords I turned with anti- 
dpation toward the bulky object 
of my search — a device which in- 
tuitive reasoning, alone, told me 
must exist. 

It was nearly tidce as large as 
me and nearly exceeddl the limit 
of mass which my mind could trans- 
port Its barrd-diaped body was 
linked by cables to S square box, 
^th the usual switch^.

IF ... AND WHEN

Such stuff as dreams are made on 



rphe average man probably does 
not remember too much of what 
he dreams, and that may be a good 
thing. Aside from nightmares — 
often based on some standard form 
of total helplessness or estrange- 
ment — most dreams don’t leave a 
vivid impression because there real- 
ly isn’t enough interesting material 
in them to be worth remembering. 
Even nightmares depend on emo- 
tional rather than intellectual in- 
terest, as a rule. 

Apparently the human mind 
spends a great deal of time in sleep 
in dreams, many of such low in- 
tensity that they aren’t remembered 
at all. Tests have indicated that 
this activity is far from useless, 
however; a man who is interrupted 
whenever his brain pattern shows 
dreaming to be taking place gets 
very little real rest out of his sleep. 
And if he is prevented from dream- 



ing for several nights, he becomes 
disoriented to a large degree, even 
though he seems to sleep enough. 

Apparently the memory gets 
loaded down with assorted bits of 
garbage and random associations 
during the day, and dreams act as 
the mental garbage collector; the 
useless material is dumped. But the 
sleeping mind can’t afford to clear 
itself without some care, so samples 
are played back and examined. 

It seems a shame, however, to 
think of all that time spent in 
dreaming with so little obvious re- 
ward in enjoyment. We know that 
a dream can be an interesting ex- 
perience. Now and then, one with 
some stronger angle will apparent- 
ly trigger the ideeping mind to build 
some kind of a story around it, and 
the personal sense of involvement 
makes it seem far better than it 
probably is.

A few people are lucky enough 
to dream mostly in stories — so far 
as they can rememba:. IVe 
known a few who could be waked 
up and go back to sleep deliber- 
ately to finish their dreams. And 
IVe talked to a couple beside my- 
self who have caught their minds 
delaying a dream until they could 
replot it, and then finishing it in 
the improved version, without wak- 
ing up. Probably that happens 
mostly to writers, who spend a fair 
amount of waking time re-plotting 
basic story ideas. 

A ndre Norton is obviously 
touching on a matter dear to 
our wishes with her expert dreamer 
who can control all of a dream 
(supposedly) and supply this well- 
developed story as a dream to an-, 
other. Obviously, if we could do 
it only from one mind to another, 
it would be as expensive as she in- 
dicates — limited only to the filthy 
rich. 

Others have suggested taping or 
broadcasting dreams. If there were 
some way to program a better grade 
of dreams for most sleepers, it 
should be even better than tele- 
vision, and save the apparent waste 
of several hours we now spend in 
sleep. Of course, someone would 
pitiably figure out how to add 
commercials, but most roses have 
thorns somewhere. 

Most of these stories in science 
fiction deal with entertainment. 



But there is no reason why it 
shouldn’t serve a serious purpose. 
A dream done by a man who could 
really play the piano might be very 
helpful to the dreamer who hasn’t 
time for steady practice; a dream of 
Valley Forge could give a sense of 
the cold and misery that no movie 
could convey to a history studeit. 

So far, nobody has been able to 
do much to influence dreams, be- 
yond such crude things as dropping 
an object with a loud crash — ^which 
sometimes produces a dream of some 
random kind around the noise. 

But dreams are an intrinsic part 
of sleep — as even careful study of 
a dog or cat will show. As such, 
they must be tied into the gaieral 
mysteries that surround the whole 
matter of sleeping. 

Here science has developed a 
wrinkle that isn’t exactly new, but 
is finding new interest though bet- 
ter means of appl3dng it. This was 
once called electronarcosis, but now 
goes under the simpler term of 
electrosleep. It’s a fairly old idea, 
first developed by a French scientist 
named Leduc near the turn of the 
century. 

Today, the Russians seem to 
have gained the lead in this field, 
using far more sophisticated equip- 
ment than was possible until recent- 
ly. American scientists are just 
picking up the idea and experiment- 
ing with it. 

The basic idea is to make the 
brain sonmolent through “negative” 



100 



IF 




stimulation with pulsing electric 
current. Here modem electronics 
has provided us with excellent means 
of adjusting voltage, amperage and 
frequency, as well as the pulse 
shape. 

The brain generates a number 
of pulses of its own. One of these, 
known as the alpha rhythm, is al- 
ways strongest and most regular 
during sleep. Scientists working with 
electrosleep usually use this alpha 
rhythm as a model, preferably while 
stud)dng the alpha rhythm of the 
subject to be put to sleep. 

First treatments last for about 
half an hour, increasing gradually 
up to three hours, after which the 
subject is allowed to sleep normal- 
ly. Many cases of insomnia can be 
cured with a dozen or so sessions, 
though more stubborn cases may 
take the course over again later for 
several times. 

The sleep induced seems to be 
normal, restful sleep, with none of 
the undesirable side effects that 
accompany most chemical means of 
causing sleep; there is no dopey 
feeling on awakening, nor is sleep 
unduly prolonged beyond the nor- 
mal, healthy period. 

G ood results have also been 
achieved in some cases in treat- 
ing schizophrenia. One theory to ac- 
count for this psychosis is that the 
brain is overstimulated (by fear, 
worry, habit, etc.) until it is suffer- 
ing from overexhaustion — which 



makes sleeping more difficult lead- 
ing to worse exhaustion I The elec- 
trosleep machine can break the cy- 
cle and give the brain cells a chance 
for the completed rest needed. 

Electrosleep equipment is gener- 
ally available in Europe, such as 
the Elektrodorm models in use in 
Russian and French clinics. But 
so far they are not available for 
home use — .nor should they be. 
The technique is still experimental, 
and the possibility for serious and 
permanent damage does exist with- 
out skilled medical supervision. 

But it seems probably that in the 
future, after enough is learned of 
this, every bedside might have its 
simplified Elektrodorm — prob- 
ably with a slot for the patient’s 
own alpha pattern to be inserted. 
With mass production, the cost of 
a machine should come down to less 
than that of a television set — and 
a black-and-white one, at that. 

Maybe by then scientists will al- 
so have been able to learn a bit 
more about sleep and how the brain 
manages it. They’ve had very poor 
success so far in trying to read 
what goes on with the encephalo- 
graph. The location and basic 
nature of the processes in the brain 
are almost as much a mystery as 
ever. 

By experimenting with the cre- 
ation of wave patterns — or the 
augmenting of them — by electric 
currents and pulses, it may be pos- 
sible to learn more. There is no way 



IF . AND WHEN 



101 




lo isolate a single type of brain 
wave from others when reading the 
signals of the living brain. But we 
can already isolate any type of sig- 
nal to be sent into the brain, and its 
effects can then be studied. WeVe 
bug suspected that the alpha rhy- 
thm is the basic clue to our sleep 
activity; now, by sending such a 
pattern through electrodes into the 
brain, weVe at least proved a di- 
rect relationship. 

AyTost of the other brain pat- 
terns are more difficult to pin 
down than the strong alpha rhythm. 
Eariy work with the encephalo- 
graph showed a fairly simple series 
of fMitterns, but it was often de- 
ceptive. The early recording ma- 
cUiies had a limited ability to 
handle higher frequencies, and often 
smoothed off the sharp peaks of 
the pulses — they were like a bad 
tape recorder tr3dng to handle 
piano music! Modern ‘‘high-fidel- 
ity^ machines have shown that the 
brain’s activity is far more com- 
plicated than the early traces in- 
dicated. 

Here we can again approach 
things from the other end. If there 
is a suspicion diat certain pidse 
patterns are involved in the use of 
speech, they can be experimental- 
ly induced and modified, while the 
subject undergoes a continuous test 
to determine the effects. This may 
also have the additional benefit of 
helping people with aphasia and 



other mental difficulties with 
speech. 

Some work has already been done 
in tT3dng to alter dreams by means 
of pulsed signals. Speech patterns 
can be impressed on the wave 
trains — or series of pulses — just 
as speech modulation can be im- 
pressed on the wave trains of radio 
signals. So far this work is highly 
experimental, and no significant re- 
sults have yet been published, but 
the beginning of dream shaping and 
dream creation is already with us. 

Andre Norton’s dream-linking 
machine isn’t Impossible, theoretic- 
ally, either. We know a great deal 
about shaping, modifying and am- 
plifying pulses; some of our elec- 
tronic organs can turn out shaped 
pulses of fantastic complexity to 
produce the ready waveform of a 
clarinet or the effects of a whole 
percussion section going at once — 
all from the electronic manipulation 
of the most simple pure tones. 

It seems entirely possible today 
to take the brain patterns of one 
person and impress them on the 
brain of a second individual, par- 
ticularly if the recipient is sleeping, 
without interference from signals 
from his sensory organs. A high- 
fidelity encephalograph can pick up 
the brain patterns of the sender 
and impress them on a train of 
pulses being sent through something 
like the Elektrodorm to the mind 
of the recipient. It can be done 
with animals as well as men for 



102 



IF 




early experiments; such things as 
a pecking movement from a send- 
ing chicken to a receiving one could 
be easily detected, at least. There 
have been reports of such efforts 
to establish “wired telepathy” re- 
ported previously, but IVe yet to 
see evidence of adequate equipment 
being used, as should be the case 
now. 

Almost certainly there is going, 
to be trouble in trying to make the 
pattern of one mind fit another. 
The signal from the sender will 
probably have to be modified con- 
siderably before it can be effective. 
But with sufficient study and even 
today’s computers, this difficulty 
can surely be overcome. Nobody 
can guarantee that there will be 
any clear transfer of thoughts — 
though that remains a possibility 
— but there is a good chance that 
at least certain basic mental activ- 
ities can be impressed on one brain 
from another. 

The machine to do this is, of 
course, exactly what Andre Norton 
describes briefly in her story. It is 
interesting to note that she limits it 
generally to one person to make 
dreams and another to receive 
them — as would be the case where 
some computer-controlled modifi- 
cation was needed to make the 
dreamer’s patterns fit the recipient 
mind. 

T ike most “inventions in the 

' egg”, this presents all sorts of 



potential benefits and problems 
— and most of them are ones we 
can’t begin to guess accurately un- 
til the invention reaches common 
usage. It’s too valuable a research 
and teaching tool to be wasted on 
entertainment, for instance; so was 
television, which was constantly be- 
ing written up as a means to inform 
and instruct — until the entertain- 
ment moguls made it a household 
commodity. 

The most obvious danger is the 
transfer of thought patterns that 
somehow deform the recipient’s 
own thoughts (except where that 
is the therepeutic goal). Will a man 
who wants to learn to appreciate 
music from the mind of a great 
musician pick up such things as 
a terror of insects — or some ugly 
racial prejudice he didn’t have be- 
fore? Or will use of the device 
weaken his own personality and 
establish a mere shadow of another 
mind in his head? This may be a 
serious problem because the impres- 
sed pulses can be made much 
stronger than the natural ones. 

I keep wondering, however, if 
dream-spinning will go through the 
phases that so often hit out ancient 
attempts to share our d -earns — 
will there be a “new wave” among 
the dream makers? Or will there 
be “adult” dreams restricted to 
those over sixteen? 

Where do you draw the line be- 
tween dreams and nightmares?

THE LIGHT BEARER 

by WILLIAM M. LEE 



Never mix pepper with nerve drugs 
— or there'll be the devil to pay I 



he Coventry Drug Company, as 
you are probably aware has 
(due of the largest research de- 
partments in the business, with 
some himdreds of chemists, phar- 
macologists and others of related 
skills, all dedicated to the discov- 
ery of new and better, but con- 
fceivably more costly, drugs. Quite 
'a few echelons from the top of 
Shis great organization was an un- 
happy yoimg man named Peter 
Co^iill. 

Five years earlier Pete Coghill, 
in somewhat erratic piursuit of his 
Ph.D., had been notably extrovert- 
ed, given to beer guzzling, ball 
games and dates with good looking 
wenches. He liked everyone aroimd 
him and was liked in turn. Though 



not exactly anybody’s genius, he 
gave promise of becoming a pretty 
good biochemist and in a gener^ 
sort of way he looked forward to 
a university career. This was not to 
be. 

The formidable Professor Metz 
assigned him a problem, the nature 
of which is neither here nor there. 
It was a neat enough problem, one 
on which Metz had already worked 
and published. Young Coghill was 
expected to do no more than fill 
in some detail. Injudiciously, Cog- 
hill undertook a new approach and 
came up with findings which com- 
pletely (and beyond dispute) in- 
validated the great man’s earlier 
work. 

If Peter had been a few years 




104 




wiser, or if he had paused to con- 
sider the possible consequences, he 
would have found a way to save 
face for Professor Metz. Instead he 
discussed his findings freely and 
gleefully around the Department. 
Metz had perforce to admit his 
error, and, indeed, encourage Cog- 
hill to make the work a part of his 
thesis; but naturally he was bitter 
about it and began, as did some of 
his faculty cronies, to avoid seeing 
Coghill when they passed in a cor- 
ridor. 

Just after Peter was awarded his 
doctorate. Professor Metz died of a 
broken heart, perhaps complicated 
by a kidney ailment, and the at- 
mosphere became so chilling that 
Peter abandoned his plans for an 
academic career and went to work 
for industry. 

His first assignment with Cov- 
entry had to do with a drug called 
Neonexal, which had been passed 
by the Food and Drug Administra- 
tion and was about to be put on 
the market. Peter was responsible 
in large part for the unwelcome dis- 
covery that occasional lots of the 
drug could cause a skin irritation 
which, while not serious, was un- 
sightly and a likely basis for law- 
suits. So Neonexal was held up for 
nearly a year while some changes 
were made to eliminate its aller- 
genic properties; and one senior re- 
search man most unfairly blamed 
Peter Coghill for making an issue 
of a trivial deficiency. 



In the following year he dis- 
covered three errors, one of them 
serious, on the parts of colleagues, 
and he hadn’t a friend left in the 
entire organization. Top manage- 
ment began to consider him an in- 
surance policy against mistakes and 
oversights and gave him the task 
of reviewing the reports of many of 
his co-workers. It took most of his 
days and left nearly no time for 
constructive work of his own. 

T>eing an insurance policy had 
^ proved at first to be unre- 
warding. Little by little, however, 
Peter Coghill was adapting to his 
job, coming to value a discovered 
error as an accomplishment in it- 
self and even savoring the act of 
pouncing on the perpetrator. He was 
in the course, that is, of becoming 
a thoroughly unpleasant character. 

His evenings provided little relief 
from the increasing loneliness of 
his days. The good looking wench- 
es he had known in college seemed 
mostly to be married and he had 
mislaid the facility to locate new 
recruits. Most nights he drank a 
couple of beers in the corner tav- 
ern and retreated to his apartment 
with the worthy but unexciting ex- 
cuse of keeping up with the scien- 
tific journals. 

One day near the beginning of 
his fifth year with Coventry, Dr. 
Coghill sat alone in his office-lab- 
oratory, considering whether to eat 
lunch first or to read Dr. Brock’s 



THE LIGHT BEARER 



105 




monthly report. He decided to do 
them together. Brock was in the 
course of synthesizing compounds 
related to LSD — not the easy ones, 
the derivatives of lysergic acid it- 
self, but structures in which the 
parent substance was subtly alter- 
ed in one way or another. 

This is not to say that Coventry 
wasn’t just as aware as any other 
responsible group of the dangers of 
LSD. Their medical staff knew all 
too much about the psychoses, the 
suicides, the accidental deaths and 
the crowd of pimply fizz heads 
which followed in its wake. Nobody 
wanted another LSD or anything 
like it; but it was much too valu- 
able a clue to the biochemistry of 
the brain to be ignored. So Brock 
was synthesizing analogs, and other 
people were testing them in mice 
and rabbits and cats and monkeys, 
and Peter Coghill picked up his red 
pencil, all ready to find a good juicy 
mistake. 

Peter had given up going to the 
company cafeteria. It was no fun 
always to eat alone at a table for 
six. Most days he put together a 
lunch of sorts before leaving his 
apartment and, along with a few 
journals, his attache case would 
usually contain a couple of sand- 
wiches and a thermos of coffee. 

Today his fare included a hard- 
boiled egg, and he performed the 
neat trick of chipping the shell off 
cleanly without once looking at it. 
He read: 



“The free base (422-4J obtained 
from the hydrochloride with silver 
oxide had a strong blue color. MP 
181-182°.” 

“Now why the hell,” said Peter 
aloud, “would it have a strong blue 
color?” He flipped back a page to 
look again at the structure, sensing 
the possibility of an error. 

"n esting in his in-basket was a 
collection of vials, each con- 
taining a minute sample of one of 
the experimental chemicals of cur- 
rent interest. Coventry circulated 
these in the hope, not often realiz- 
ed, that they might stimulate some- 
one to serendipitous thought. Sure 
enough, there was Brock’s 422-4, 
along with several others of the 
series. The sample was blue, no 
question of that, even though it was 
a fine powder. Very odd. No rea- 
son at all for it to be colored. 

Carefully Peter spilled a little 
heap of the blue dust on a sheet 
of paper and even more carefully 
sniffed it. Odorless. He returned to 
his reading and his lunch. He found 
nothing to red pencil and very little 
to give him pause up to the last 
page, when the room shook. 

His first thought was that an ex- 
plosion had occurred in one of the 
nearby rooms, and he shot out of 
his own laboratory and stood peer- 
ing up and down the empty corri- 
dor. There was no sound or sign of 
excitement. No alarm bells clanged. 
It could have been a very small 



106 



IF 




earthquake, he told himself. Leav- 
ing the door open, he went back to 
his desk and sat down with a thud 
on a chair that had suddenly be- 
come an inch higher than usual. 
Peter closed his eyes, then opened 
them and looked at the white pad 
that should have had a small heap 
of blue powder on it. The powder 
was gone, or very nearly. Next to 
the pad was another piece of paper, 
once folded neatly, now open. It 
bore a scatter of salt and pepper. 
There were crumbs of hard boiled 
egg on both sheets. He stared si- 
lently at the evidence and wonder- 
ed what he had just done to him- 
self. 

Structures like this one (to the 
extent that you could infer such 
things) weren’t likely to be violent- 
ly toxic, but they were very likely 
indeed to produce distortions of the 
mind or senses; some of them damn- 
ed unpleasant. Peter knew this from 
reading and observing, not from per- 
sonal experience. By habit he shied 
away from pill taking and had 
never been tempted to that practice 
of some biochemists to try things 
on themselves. The knowledge that 
he was now absorbing into his 
bloodstream a compound of totally 
unknown properties w^s dinstinctly 
discomforting. 

The room shook again, quite 
sharply this time, and he was on 
the point of rising to see whether 
anything on the laboratory benches 
was in danger of falling off, but re- 



minded himself that these tremors 
were subjective and unreal. So, of 
course, was the slow tilt which he 
was now perceiving — a few degrees 
to the right, back to normal, then 
a few more degrees. He remembered 
reading about a hoped-for morphine 
substitute which not only slanted 
the room, but convinced several 
experimental subjects that they 
were hanging from the ceiling. 

His own laboratory came grad- 
ually to rest about fifteen degrees 
to starboard. Not a bad angle at all. 
The room looked rather nice that 
way. He wondered whether the en- 
tire Coventry Tower Building point- 
ed slanting toward the sky, and 
told himself not to be vainglorious. 
Where the hell had that word come 
from? He really ought to let some- 
body know, so he dialed Dr. Brock 
who more than anybody should be 
interested in 422-4. There was no 
answer. The wall clock told him it 
was a quarter after. Everybody 
would be at lunch. He tried Dr. 
Kinnison. No answer. Rather xm- 
willingly he dialed the infirmary, 
but hung up before they answered. 

Oo okay, he would ride it out 
^ alone. Lock the door, that came 
first. Against the rules to lock a lab 
door during working horns. Pfui. 
He wasn’t working. He bent one leg 
against the tilt and made it to the 
door gracefully and with some 
aplomb. The latch made a satisfy- 
ing snick, though his fingers weren’t 



THE LIGHT BEARER; 



107 




working quite right. Thurber had 
said something about nouns show- 
ing up in the past tense; that his 
fingers were becoming fungers. How 
neatly Thurber stated things. 

Back at his desk with notebook 
open and pen poised, he sat pre- 
pared for all things to be said or 
left unsaid. His clothes had tingled 
as he walked, which must be noted, 
and so he wrote (back-hand to com- 
pensate for the tilt), '^garments do 
tingle.” 

The door opened and Dr. Hugo 
Carreford walked into the room. 

That he had entered through a 
just-locked door was less surprising 
than the visitor’s identity. Peter 
had once heard Dr, Carreford make 
the keynote address at a very im- 
portant meeting, had read several 
of his papers and had seen his pic- 
ture many times. Carreford was an 
accepted authority in half a dozen 
learned fields, a brilliant teacher, 
an advisor to presidents, in short 
the prototype and paragon of schol- 
ars. Peter leaped to his feet, paw- 
ing the air only a little to correct 
his balance. Perhaps in the presence 
of so great a man the aberrant an- 
gles were correcting themselves. In 
any case the tilted room became 
unnoticeable. 

^Tlease,” said Carreford, and 
waved a bony hand in typical ges- 
ture. 'Tlease, Dr. Coghill, do sit 
down. Relax. You make me feel my 
visit is somehow dismaying. There, 
I’ll take this lab stool. Time was, 



you know, when my rump was bet- 
ter contoured to the lab stool than 
the easy chair. I see that you smoke, 
so I’ll take the liberty.” 

Peter watched rat^r numbly as 
his visitor fitted a cigarette to the 
long black holder which had be- 
come a Carreford trademark. He 
found his voice. 

^^To what am I indebted . ?” 
he began, then realized how utterly 
silly the question sounded, and let 
it trail off. 

Carreford blew a plume of smoke 
toward the ceiling and smiled, the 
corners of his mouth turning up till 
he looked like a sculptured sat5n*. 

^'Yes indeed, a natural question, 
which I can and shall answer. First 
let me say that my appearance here, 
though made at some personal in- 
convenience, is a pleasure. One is 
always happy to meet a fellow 
who is due to accomplish great 
things.” 

'^Hahl” said Peter. 

”I beg your pardon?” 

'^Hahl” Peter repeated with fer- 
vency. 'T know just what accom- 
plishments I’m likely to make; 
tearing apart work that somebody 
else has done. That’s what. And 
you know it, too.” 

Carreford raised bushy eyebrows 
in astonishment. do?” 

^^Of course. For a minute I for- 
got I was doped up with a halluci- 
nating agent. You walked in 
through a locked door, which 
should have been a tip-off, but I’m

not thinking too dearly. Besides, 
you do look real, you know.” 
'^Thank you,” Carreford said 
drily. ''It^s reassiuring to be told. 
As a realistic hallucination, then, I 
should know what you know. Is 
that it? Let me assure you, the 
situation is not quite that simple. 
You won^t mind, perhaps, if I ask 
you some questions?” 

P eter’s laugh held a note of hys- 
teria. '^This is asinine. It’s one 
thing to see a hallucination, some- 
thing else to debate with it about 
its reality. How screwed up can you 
get? So go ahead and ask your ques- 
tions.” 

"You have already answered a 
first and most important question. 
It required, you see, a rather spe- 
dfic concatenation of circumstances 
to bring me here; the drugs, that 
is, your character and your need.” 
Peter lost the thread of this re- 
mark and took to staring around the 
laboratory. The effects of the 422-4 
were now much more interesting 
than alarming, and the concern with 
which he had viewed his role as an 
unwitting guinea pig had disappear- 
ed. 

"Sam Brock,” he remarked aloud, 
"is going to be very much inter- 
ested. J’he light in the room seems 
to have increased not less than 
three-fold.” In a mental aside he 
noted his casual use of the unfa- 
miliar expression. "Three, four or 
five-fold. Dazzling. The walls are 



lacy and light permeable. Yonder 
Venetian blind has fulfilled itself 
with crackling streamers of blue. In 
fact, you’re the only thing here that 
looks solid, and you’re a phantasm. 
I could walk right through you.” 
"Please,” said Dr. Carreford, 
"don’t try it, and I’d really rather 
you stopped peering at me as though 
trying to see through. My interior 
is, after all, rather personal. But 
now to business. You are unhappy 
because you find yourself cast as a 
critic of the scientific drama rather 
than an actor.” 

"Who said I was unhappy?” 
"You are. Let us not belabor the 
point. You want greatly to be an 
originator, an innovator, a creative 
thinker, which, in fact, you must 
be. My kind of assignment, you 
know.” 

Peter shook his head. "Are you 
telling me that you’ve been assigned 
to visit me to discuss my creative- 
ness?” 

"Approximately that, yes.” 
"Who assigned you?” 

Carreford gestured vaguely. 
"Well, um, the Committee, shall we 
say?” 

"Say it if you wish. You’re a 
preposterous hallucination. Who’s 
on the Committee?” 

"Different people, different peo- 
ple. Albert, of course, and Niels, 
Sir Humphrey. Some others. Lucifer 
is the permanent chairman.” 
"Lucifer! You’re an emissary 
from the devil?” 



THE LIGHT BEARER)

' I cigarette holder waggled in 
a manner suggesting annoy- 
ance, and left a zigzag of orange 
light in its wake. ''Now, please, 
young man, let’s not fall into that 
ancient error. Lucifer is the light 
bearer and was once an angel of 
excellent character. He fell, how- 
ever, from heaven as a result of 
certain misdemeanors. Someday 
these will be expunged from the 
books, but in the long meanwhile he 
must serve on some millions of com- 
mittees. 

"I thought Lucifer was one of the 
names of Satan.” 

"There is considerable confusion 
in the literature, I must admit. Let 
us consider him, notwithstanding, 
as a bearer of light. On this brief 
errand, my visit to you, such is as- 
suredly my mission. To bear some 
enlightenment, that is. Now, young 
Dr. Coghill, I ask you, what is 
your attitude toward a mistake? Do 
you regard it as a challenge?” 
"What do you mean?” 

Dr. Carreford wreathed himself 
in silvery smoke. His cigarette had 
grown no shorter and now appeared 
to be a super king size. "I’ll ex- 
plain. I do in fact know something 
of your history. Early in your ca- 
reer you detected an error on the 
part of one Professor Metz. Metz, 
as I recall, had the manners of an 
ill-natured peacock, but he was an 
able scientist and he didn’t deserve 
what you did to him.” 

"But he was wrong.” 



'"Of course he was wrong. But if 
you and he together had reviewed 
discrepancies between your findings, 
a more significant conclusion would 
have been reached. Why is 422 blue 
— those few micrograms you swal- 
lowed?” 

"Probably contaminated. What’s 
that got to do with anything?” 
"I’ve no notion,” Carreford said. 
"It may be quite unimportant. But 
once upon a time somebody found 
some blue specks in a batch of 
phthalic anhydride, and a new dye 
industry was born. When you saw 
that blue color you were startled. 
You said, I believe, ^why the hell?’ 
Now you dismiss it as an unknown 
contaminant. Um. Let us get back 
to the matter of mistakes.” 

Peter grimaced. "I wish I could 
stop finding them.” 

"You never will,” Carreford told 
him. "You never will. You have a 
quick eye and a keen analytical 
sense. But you must never again 
turn a mistake to anybody’s disad- 
vantage. That’s the easy part of 
my advice. But mark this welll 
What may at first seem a mistake 
may prove, if one is lucky, to be a 
wild fact.” 

"A what?” 

"A wild fact. The point that lies 
off the curve, the analysis that adds 
to a hundred and five percent, the 
bacterial broth that unexplainably 
begins to foam, the hint of an odor 
where there should be none. Faced 
with what is difficult to explain. 



no 



IF 




you, my young friend, are given to 
deducing a mistake, and you may 
often be right. But make that de- 
duction as a last resort, if you 
please. Hold the belief, for a time 
anyway, that your odd datum may 
be right, even if that requires you 
to sacrifice some things you know 
and dierish. Examine your wild 
facts forward and backward, upside 
down and inside out, and one of 
these days you’ll be known as an 
original thinker.” 

''Is that how you did it?” Peter 
Coghill inquired. 

^arreford grinned and looked 
^ alarmingly satanic for a mo- 
ment. "So now you ask the old 
phantasm how he, as Hugo Carre- 
ford, achieved success. Well, there 
are a variety of approaches to rec- 
ognition, but those of us who pos- 
sess creativity — I include both of 
us, naturally — seem to display the 
trait at an early age. You, for ex- 
ample, are reported to have built 
a seismograph of sorts before you’d 
ever heard of such an instrument, 
and succeeded in detecting trucks 
as they passed a block away.” 
"Aha,” said Peter, "oho. That 
proves it. You’re a figment of my 
imagination, otherwise you coiddn’t 
remember what I’ve almost forgot- 
ten. On the other hand — ” Peter 
held up his left hand and regarded 
it surprisedly, since it appeared to 
be backward. " — on the other 
hand, you’re giving me some good 



advice — well anyway, advice — 
which strongly suggests that you 
want something from me in return. 
So-o-o-o.” The sound of the last 
word pleased him and he continued 
it for some time until the air was 
quite full of little round O’s. 

"So?” Carreford prompted. 

"So you must be an emissary of 
the devil.” 

"Lucifer, as I told you.” 
"Lucifer, the devil, Satan, Beel- 
zebub. You’re trying to buy my 
soul.” 

Carreford chuckled, seeming in 
high good humor. "And what is 
your soul, my dear Dr. Coghill? As 
a biochemist of course you must 
have a theory. Would it be a duct- 
less gland, a hormone perhaps, a pe- 
culiar sequence in a hidden helix 
of DNA? An enzyme? You fellows 
invent a new enzyme every time 
you want to explain a biological 
event. Well, whatever your soul 
happens to be, I don’t really want 
it, and neither does the Commit- 
tee.” 

"Then what do you want?” 
"Just to help you get back on 
the course of a career from which 
you have been straying.” 

"For a hallucination, you’ve been 
making some statements which 
sound uncommonly sensible. I won- 
der if I’ll remember it later. Wait.” 
He seized his pen and wrote in 
an ungainly scrawl. When he looked 
up Dr. Carreford had become rath- 
er dim. 



THE LIGHT BEARER;

“I can so,” said Peter suddenly. 

”Can what?” 

"See through you. No detail, but 
I can see the doorknob about where 
your liver should be.” 

"Ah, yes. I’m about to depart 
and this is the easiest way. I am, 
at the moment, attending a confer- 
ence on education in Rome and I 
should be getting back. Somebody 
might say something intelligent, you 
know. Concerning my advice. If 
you decide to act on it, you may 
— just possibly — incur a slight 
obligation. Nothing to do with 
souls.” 

"Then what?” Peter asked. 

"You might be asked to go on 
an errand someday. An errand sim- 
ilar to this. Nothing arduous, but 
you do get into some of the damn- 
edest conversations. One last word. 
Don’t mix pepper with drugs likely 
to have a central nervous system 
effect. Capsicum is frequently syn- 
ergistic.” 

TT^ith that the figure dimmed 
^ ^ still further until it was bare- 
ly visible, then it disappeared with 
a small popping sound. After a 
minute Peter rose and prowled the 
laboratory, navigating now without 
difficulty. Feeling foolish, he waved 
his arm through the air over the 
lab stool. Naturally there was noth- 
ing, nothing beyond a faint unfa- 
miliar fragrance of Turkish tobacco. 

"Well,” said Peter; then, after 
some thought, "Well.” The clock 

m 



stood at one ten, but he had not 
perceived the passing of nearly an 
hour. To all intents and purposes 
then, he had been asleep, and he 
foimd himself stiU overpowerin^y 
sleepy. He slumped into his chair, 
elevated his feet to the desk and 
slept dreamlessly until nearly five 
o’clock. 

The following day, with no evi- 
dent aftereffects from his encoun- 
ter with 422, he was inclined to 
smile at his recollections, already 
becoming a little hazy. He gave a 
much abbreviated account to Dr. 
Brock. In due course, 422-4 was 
tested in mice for toxicity and in 
cats for behavioral effects. It prov- 
ed to be quite inactive and was pre- 
sently abandoned in favor of other, 
more promising structures. 

At no time during the next year 
did anyone become aware of any 
change in Dr. Coghill’s character, or 
realize that their attitudes toward 
him were changing little by little. 
By the end of that time, however, 
his comments on programs were be- 
ing sought out, because so often he 
had something helpful to suggest. 
Let’s kick it around with Pete, be- 
came a frequent expression and his 
table in the cafeteria was the center 
of a lot of productive discussions. 

In later years, as we all know. 
Dr. Coghill accomplished much. But 
his first major accomplishment was 
in some respects one of the most 
interesting. It began not long after 
his marriage to an exceedingly good 

IB 




looking wench who thought that 
biochemistry was an odd way for a 
grown man to make a living . 
But she liked to cook, she liked 
most of his friends and she knew 
how to listen. They got along fine. 

^^his particular thing started one 
day when he’d gone into one 
of the animal labs to share a coffee 
break with Joe Polanetsky. Joe was 
standing before a collection of white 
rats, scribbling notations on a clip 
board. There was a score or more 
of the rats, each quartered in a 
separate cage. They were largely 
comatose. 

"Here’s your coffee,” said Peter. 
"What are you doing with those?” 
"They’re for Doc Siever,” Joe 
said. "For his anti-shock drug work. 
Once a week I’ve been putting a 
collection of rats into mild shock, 
then he tries to bring them out of 
it.” 

"How do you do it.” 

"Put rats into shock? Various 
ways. These got a series of electric 
shocks ranging from barely percep- 
tible up to fairly unpleasant, along 
with lights and noises. Vary the 
timing and the sequence. After a 
while poor old rattus gets to the 
point he doesn’t know what’s going 
to happen next and he doesn’t much 
care. He turns pale, ceases to wiggle 
his whiskers and so on.” 

"What about number five?” Pet- 
er asked. "That one. He looks pret- 
ty frisky. Held out as a control?” 



"Nope. He’s had the treatment, 
too. Sometimes you get rats that 
don’t give up. At least they don’t 
go into shock in up to twice the 
usual period.’’ 

Peter went over and watched 
number five thoughtfully. "Mind if 
I tickle him?” 

Joe looked severe. "If you enjoy 
tickling rats, you may. I don’t know 
what Freud would have made of it.” 
Peter lifted the lid and prodded 
number five with a cautious fore- 
finger. Number five looked inter- 
ested. 

"Would Siever let me have him, 
do you think?” 

"He’s no use to Siever. I’ll put 
him back in stock, marked for you. 
What do you want to do with him?” 
"I don’t know. Do these resistant 
rats come in both sexes?” 

"Never noticed.” 

"How many do you get?” 

"One in a couple hundred, may- 
be.” 

"Save me some more, will you?” 
"Sure enough.” 

■polanetsky called him on the 
phone a month or so later. 
"I’ve got six. Four of them are 
females. If you still want them, you 
owe me a drink.” 

"I do,” Peter said, and went to 
see Helen Markley, the geneticist. 
He still had no idea what he was 
going to do with them, but he 
wanted to know the pattern of in- 
heritability of the resistance. 



THE LIGHT BEARER 



113 




WhUe Helen was finding this out 

— purely as a favor, since there 
was no official project on the books 

— Peter Coghiii began to look for 
biochemical variations in his rats 
and Polanetsky bootlegged some be- 
havioral studies. These were inter- 
esting. The rats which resisted 
shock also learned mazes more rap- 
idly than their fellows and took 
longer to forget them. By choice 
they ate a little more heavily and, 
in the jiggle cages, showed higher 
than normal activity. Peter took to 
carrying one of them in his side 
coat pocket, and several times car- 
ried him home. Let it be said for 
Susan Coghill that, after some ini- 
tial reservation, she became quite 
fond of one exceptionally intelligent 
rat called Hugo. 

The search for biochemical varia- 
tions proved, however, to present 
difficulties. The Coventry manage- 
ment tolerated, and to a degree en- 
couraged, research bootlegging, but 
they had about reached the point of 
clamping down on any further work 
on shock-resistant rats, when Peter 
received from Anal5d;ical Depart- 
ment this note, still unofficial and 
correspondingly informal: 

/'We reanalyzed the nerve fibre 
extract. The second cut was tri- 
methyl hydroxyethylphosphonium 
chloride. Elemental analysis is damn 
near on the nose. Confirmed by 
titration and IR. If you want an 
NMR, you’ll have to get a topside 
blessing.” 



Carried by Peter to the Direc- 
tor’s office, this brief report had 
immediate impact, and before the 
end of the working day he had re- 
ceived his topside blessing, an allo- 
cation of funds and two new assis- 
tants. 

Susan heard him banging around 
in the kitchen. 

"What’s up?” she called. 

"Hugo and I are going to have 
a martini,” he shouted back, then 
added generously, "You may have 
one, too.” 

"Well, thanks. Did you get a 
raise?” 

"No, nothing like that. This is 
important.” 

Tt must be recorded that Hugo did 
not like his first taste of mar- 
tini. Deplorable, but one can’t ex- 
pect too much of a rat. 

"OK,” Susan said presently. 
"Settle down and tell me about it. 
Easy words only, remember.” 

"Very good,” said Peter. "First 
of all, you recall that Hugo and a 
few of his cousins are very superior 
rats.” 

"How could I forget it?” 

"Right. And we’re beginning — 
Helen Markley is — to be able to 
breed this quality into them. But 
we hadn’t found out why they were 
the way they are. Not until today. 
Not until today. We had dissected 
out some nerve fibres and analyzed 
them six ways from Sunday, but we 
kept missing it.

^'So-0. In our nerves — yours and 
mine — there’s a material called 
acetylcholine. It can come apart 
and go together again very rapidly 
like an on-off switch^ and this ef- 
fect causes impulses to travel along 
the nerve. Okay? Well, choline con- 
sists of a centrd nitrogen atom with 
three methyl groups and a hydrox- 
cthyl group attached to it.” 
^^Hvdroxethyl group. Sort of like 
dcohol?” 

^'Sort ot. i:jo our nerves contain 
this choline and so do rats’ nerves, 
including Hugo’s. Only, as we 
found out today, his contain some- 
thing else, too, in a very small 
quantity. It’s a central atom of 
phosphorus with three methyl and 
one hydroxethyl group attached. 
You see? The same thing except 
for the central atom.” 

'T guess I see.” 

“Of course you do. The molecules 
aren’t exactly the same shape, but 
they should have the same function 
in the body, almost certainly.” 
“And this is important? Is this 
why we’re having martinis?” 
“Right. Heres the rest of the 
picture. Hugo is smarter and heal- 
thier and has a finer moral char- 
acter than other rats. Haven’t you, 
Hugo? Somewhere among the 
branches of his family tree he 
learned to synthesize this phospho- 
rous compound and how to use it, 
along with choline, to carry nerve 
impulses. Presumably it’s a little 
more efficient than choline, and this 



accounts for his smartness although 
there isn’t yet any solid evidence 
for that presumption. I’m making 
an inference. Right? 

“So okay. Humans, at least so 
far as we know, haven’t learned 
to synthesize this compound. Ques- 
tion: If we provide it, say by in- 
jection, can human nerves learn how 
to use it? Will it increase human 
abilities to resist shock and to think 
better and to find our way through 
our own frightening mazes? This 
is speculation, of course. LrOts of 
work still to be done. In the mean- 
while you had better not mention 
it.” 

“Mention it?” said Susan. “I 
can’t even remember it.” 

'^his, then, was only the first 
of a number of important de- 
velopments in medicine which are 
credited to Dr. Coghill. You must 
have seen his picture in Time quite 
recently, when he was given an- 
other honorary doctorate in Cali- 
fornia. 

He travels a good deal these 
days and makes a lot of important 
speeches. 

Not long ago Peter and Susan 
were in Paris, he to attend an in- 
ternational conference, she to pick 
up a few dresses. Late one after- 
noon they came back to their hotel 
and who should Peter see but Dr. 
Hugo Carreford sitting in the 
lounge with the American ambassa- 
dor.

''Let’s walk over this way,” he 
said to Susan. That’s Dr. Carre- 
ford over there, and I’d like to get 
a good look at him.” 

They would have walked past, 
looking as casual as possible, ex- 
cept that Carreford rose and waved 
his cigarette holder in greeting. 
“Peter,” he called, “Peter Cog- 
hill. So good to see you again. Am- 
bassador, I’d like you to meet Dr. 
CoghiU and — I presume — Mrs. 
Coghill. How nice that you could 
come along to Paris.” 

Peter shook hands numbly and, 
unable to find words, said noth- 
ing. 

Dr. Carreford filled the gap. 
“This young man. Ambassador, is 
the fellow who fathered the drug 
that stimidates learning and has 
turned our whole academic world 
topsy turvy. He also has the dis- 
tinction, if you can call it that, of 
having a strain of white rats named 
after him 

“I do trust, Peter, that you 
have not been mixing pepper 
with any of your experimental 
products. Capsicum, you know, has 
some odd synergistic effects. Don’t 
look so baffled, Mrs. Coghill. Just 
a private joke of ours.” 

That was four months ago, and 
Peter Coghill hasn’t heard a word 
from the Committee.

AUTHORGRAPHS: 

An Interview 
with 

Jack Williamson 

T must have started writing 
-** sdence fiction in 1926, or 
thereabouts. A little bit earlier IM 
read Mark Twain’s Connecticut 
Yankee and been thrilled by it and 
tried to write a sort of imitation of 
it called The Castle of the Seven 
\^Gates. I used up all my material 
,on the first page. 

! . When Hugo Gernsback’s Amazing 
\Stories came out, which was in 
1926, this was exciting to me. 
Earlier I’d thought about science, 
hoped to be a scientist, saw no real 
opportunity; but at least I was in- 
terested in science. And when I dis- 
covered science fiction, why here 
was something I could do about 
it, I suppose. I started writing 
science-fiction stories in my spare 
time, sending those I could finish 
to Gernsback. And in ’28 he pub- 
lished one of them, called The 
Metal Man, 

After I’d been writing for a while 
I got acquainted with Edmond 
Hamilton through Jerry Siegel, the 
inventor of Superman, who’d been 
corresponding with Ed and with me. 

I met Ed for the first time in a 

117 




hotel in St. Paul, Minnesota. We 
had originally planned to buy a 
houseboat and drift down the Mis- 
sissippi River. The houseboat idea 
didn’t work out, so we got an out- 
board motorboat and went down the 
river, camping on the banks the 
first part of the trip, then later 
staying in YMCA’s and so forth at 
night. Finally, when the outboard 
motor wore out, we sold the boat 
and went on down the river on the 
Tennessee Belle, which was one of 
the last of the old riverboats. The 
trip on that was something like a 
chapter out of Mark Twain’s Life 
on the Mississippi. Ed and % 




talked about science fiction, and 
the captains on the boat talked 
about old days on the river. 

Mostly IVe never done anything 
else but write science fiction. I 
was on Air Force weatherman for 
about three years, 1942 to 1945; 
and lately, for the last dozen years, 
IVe been edging back into the 
academic field. 

In my Army service, when I went 
to Fort Bliss for induction, and got 
shipped to Chanute Field, I had 
three choices of what I wanted to 
do when I got in. I put down first 
“glider pilot” — thank t]te Lord I 
didn^t b^ome a glider pilot! — and 
second “intelligence” and third 
“weather”. I got to be a weather- 
man. I was very happy about it. 
I spent eleven weeks at Chanute 
Field learning to be a weather 
observer, and six months in the 
field practicing weather observation 
— that is, taking observations, plot- 
ting^aps and so forth — and went 
back to forecasting school at Chan- 
ute Field for twenty-two weeks. I 
came out as a weather forecaster 
and spent fifteen months at Hobbs, 
New Mexico forecasting the weather 
for a four-engine pilot training 
school flying B-17^s. Finally, in 
1945, I went overseas to the South- 
west Pacific and briefly had a try 
at forecasting tropical weather for 
the Marine air groups that were 
heckling the Japanese in the North- 
ern Solomons. 

I had started out to become a 



chemist. But when I got into chem- 
istry, it began to look like sort of 
drudgery. Physics turned out to be 
far more interesting. I suH>ose if I 
could have been a scientist, I should 
have liked to be a theoretical phy- 
sicist, or an astronomer. I’m still 
very much interested in such 
branches of science. 

I had dropped out of college 
after three years. I entered college 
first in 1928; and I got my bache- 
lor’s and master’s degrees in 1957 
— after a lapse of 29 years, I be- 
lieve it is. I got my Ph.D. in 
1964. Since 1960 I’ve been teach- 
ing English at Eastern New Mexico 
University, and I’ve been writing 
science fiction in the summers, since 
I finished my doctoral dissertation. 
That was: H. G, Wells: A Critical 
Progress, my idea being that there 
is an unfair stereotype of Wells as 
a sort of materialistic Utopian who 
believed that machinery and science 
and progress could solve all our 
problems. My thesis in this is that 
Wells had been apprehensive about 
change from the beginning, afraid 
of what was going to happen, and 
that in much of his life — when he 
was writing The OMtline of History 
and The Science of Life and his 
work on economics — he was trying 
to educate the human race, to make

years he became pessimistic about 
his education effort — and about

anybody saving the human race. 

He was — well, a great man, I 
think; and the real father of mod- 
ern science fiction. Most of mod- 
ern science fiction has been writ- 
ten in patterns that Wells pioneered. 

In modern science fiction, the big 
names that occur to me are Hein- 
lein and Arthur Clarke — and Ray 
Bradbury, I suppose; it’s debatable 
whether he writes science fiction, 
but he writes literature. Heinlein 
and Clarke are two people I like 
to name because they can see good 
things happening in the future 
because science can be used to solve 
problems and make the world, pos- 
sibly, better. There are only a few 
writers you can think of who take 
this point of view. Most of the best 
modern science fiction belongs to 
the dystopian and anti-Utopian 
school, the school of the early Wells, 
and Huxley’s Brave N ew W orld and 
Orwell’s 1984. They see nothing 
good coming out of progress; even 
if science solves our problems, it 
destroys us in the process. 

At the university, I used to teach 
a course in writing the short story. 
Now I have a course in science fic- 
tion that is about half appreciation 
and half writing; most of the stu- 
dents are interested in writing 
science fiction, and I let them write 
either critical papers or science- 
fiction stories. Some of them have 
been writing some excellent stories; 
I’ve been thinking I might publish 
a class magazine this semester. 



Among the new science-fiction 
writers, I was very much taken 
with Delany’s The Einstein Inter- 
section — written in a dazzling 
style; a wonderful story with a 
flavor of its own. Half of the way 
it reads like fantasy, but it has. a 
disturbing amount of reality in it, 
also. It’s something new and excit- 
ing. 

I haven’t read too much of Bal- 
lard. But his story. The Drowned 
Giant, strikes me as a classic. It 
has a sort of mythological impact 
to me. Of course, I’m generally a 
little cool toward the ‘‘New Wave”. 
As I understand the New Wave, 
what it does is essentially to throw 
out the tested ideas of plot and 
characterization in favor of radical 
experiments in language, style and 
presentation, and most of the so- 
called “New Wave” things leave me 
cold. But when you have something 
like The Einstein Intersection, that 
has believable characters and in- 
teresting action, why, it’s wonder- 
ful. 

In the forty or so years I’ve been 
writing science fiction, I suppose 
many writers have influenced me. 
In the beginning I was a tremen- 
dous admirer of A. Merritt. In a 
way, I still am. But I’ve recently 
been looking at some of the old 
stories that I wrote under Merritt’s 
influence, and they seem to me too 
flowery, with too many adjectives 
and too much elaboration of style. 
What I try to do nowadays is some- 



AUTHORGRAPHS:

thing leaner and simpler. The in- 
fluences have been too numerous 
to mention, I suppose. Now I like 
the way Hemingway writes. There 
was a writer named C. E. Scoggins, 
who used to write for the Saturday 
Evening Post, whose style and way 
of construction I admired, and 
attempted to imitate when I was 
becoming Will Stewart for John 
Campbell dining the war, when he 
wanted a new name on the contents 
page of Astounding. 

Science-fiction writers are pretty 
much the same as when I first got 
started, nearly 40 years ago. They’re 
vocal, they’re full of ideas that are 
challenging and interesting to me. 
They don’t agree on anything, and 
they’re likely to disagree explosive- 
ly. It seems to me that the New 
Wave writers are a little more pes- 
simistic or soured on the world. It’s 
possible that more writers were 
more optimistic about the future 
thirty years ago than they are now; 
more of them felt that science 
would do us good, and not so many 
were convinced that science would 
do us harm. But they weren’t all 
rosy optimists even then. Wells was 
pretty pessimistic about the pos- 
sible futures. 

When I was in England, I looked 
for Wells’ country. London has 
since sprawled out over all of the 
War of the Worlds territory, so it 
wasn’t like WeDs had described it. 
But I got a thrfll out of seeing 
familiar names on street intersec- 
120 



tions and so forth. What was 
countryside when the Martians 
came is now built up with modern 
housing. 

On that trip, my wife and I flew 
to Spain, spent a week in Madrid, 
crossed North Africa to Egypt; we 
were there for five days, seeing the 
Pyramids, et cetera. Then we came 
back through Athens and made 
some tours to the Greek islands; a 
few days in Italy, then up across 
Europe to England. When we were 
making this part of the trip it was 
fascinating to me to see the evi- 
dences of how civilization was born 
in the Near East and spread across 
Europe. 

Then, from England, we spent 
a couple of weeks on a guided tour 
to Russia. Russia had a sort of 
science-fictional interest of its own, 
in that it is a society very much 
like ous Western society, but based 
on slightly different assumptions — 
the assumption that Marx was right. 
This gave it a kind of familiarity 
with a difference that was poignant, 
partly because the Russian cities 
— with the trees in the streets and 
the absence of motorcars — had a 
sort of nineteenth-century aspect. 
So Russia was exciting and a lot 
of fun; and then we came back to 
London in time for a science-fiction 
convention, which sort of finished 
this tour of the past to the future 
that began with the Pyramids.

TOURISTS WELCOME 

by ROGER DEELEY 



Some tourists will buy anything ! 



■police Sergeant Herbert Slocombe 
was strolling leisurely down Max- 
combe Parva High Street. He was 
an imposing figure this Police Ser- 
geant Herbert Slocombe — tall, 
perhaps huge is more the word, 
with a waistline that laughed 
mockingly at diet sheets, and a 
pair of feet to put the Queen Mary 
to shame. Police modernization had 
spread to most parts of the country, 
where patrol cars, personal walkie- 
talkies, helicopters and mobile 
headquarters were no longer new 
terms, but progress is slow in some 
parts of the country, and nowhere 
more so than in Maxcombe Parva. 
Here at night Police Sergeant Slo- 
combe still ambled slowly along 
his beat on his size thirteens, able 



and ready to deal with all the ter- 
rors that the world of crime was 
prepared to throw at him, normal- 
ly consisting on an average week of 
half a dozen traffic offenses, an oc- 
casional break-in, young boys steal- 
ing apples, and poaching. And 
poaching. And poaching. 

The local poacher was Geoffrey 
Rye. And he was a poacher par 
excellence, a poacher whose sheer 
uncanny ability left everyone else 
in the shade. He could sniff rab- 
bits miles off, and he knocked 
down pheasants by the score — si- 
lently — with an old crossbow he 
had made himself. Everyone knew 
this happened. But could they catch 
him? Not on your life. Once in a 
while, to be sure, Geoff would ac- 



121 




cidentally round a corner too fast 
on his old bike and run straight 
into some arm of the law, too un- 
expectedly to get rid of the sack 
full of dead stock over his shoul- 
der. There would be a fine, perhaps 
a couple of months in jail, but he 
was soon back to take up where he 
left off. He was no criminal, no 
member of the underworld, just 
someone who couldn’t see quite 
eye to eye with the local game- 
keepers, and who happened to like 
rabbit pie. 

In the summer months, the sit- 
uation got a bit different, for 
Geoff rather tended to fancy him- 
self as a bit of a con man. This 
part of the West Country was 
Toiurist Country, and large portly 
foreigners in enormous befinned 
cars, festooned with ultra-modern 
cameras and other wondrous gadgets, 
(descended on Maxcombe Parva and 
the near area, determined to drink 
in the beauty of the English coun- 
tryside. And Geoff loved it. Orig- 
inally he had simply hung arotmd 
the local pub, told fascinated tour- 
ists at great length and in great 
detail some of the more lurid if 
more imaginative historical details 
of this particular area (^'Ar yes, 
m’dear, that there chair you’m sit- 
tin’ on be the selfsame chair that 
old Charley the Second sat on to 
rest when we were being chased by 
the Roundheads.”) in the hope of 
making out of it a couple of drinks 
and a smoke. 



Then he discovered the engag- 
ing fact that these tourists were 
only too willing to buy that self- 
same chair to take home with them 
to Connecticut, to show off to the 
folks. And so the idea had mush- 
roomed. Sergeant Slocombe, being 
the senior police officer of the dis- 
trict, had smiled amiably at such 
goings-on, merely shaking his head 
sorrowfully at the seemingly end- 
less naivete of tourists, until Geoff 
had started selling things that were 
not his to sell. This had to be stop- 
ped, and a few fines imposed by 
the local Bench seemed to have had 
a salutary effect. But only seemed. 
Geoff went on from strength to 
strength, and on one famous day 
he sold the entire Town Hall clock 
complete with tower to no less than 
five people on the same afternoon. 
And oddly enough, most of the 
time he got away with it. When 
their astonishing gullibility was 
pointed out to them, the tourists 
were so appalled with themselves 
that they left the district immedi- 
ately without ever bothering to 
press charges. 

So Geoff prospered, relatively 
speaking. Once in a blue moon, he 
made a fortune from some enter- 
prising idiot, but it all got spent at 
once, or else an enormous great 
fine took most of it off him, so he 
was reduced to poaching again, 
come winter. His relations with the 
law were friendly, almost neighbor- 
ly. No one bothered anyone much.

IF 




They remained the best of enemies. 

B ut on this day in question, Ser- 
geant Slocombe was puzzled. 
A sort of miniature crime wave 
seemed to have hit the sleepy vil- 
lage, and he was determined to find 
out the cause. Six cars had been 
reported stolen in the last three 
hours, which — considering only 
two others had gone since the end 
of the war — was an astonishing 
fact, to say the least. Sergeant Slo- 
combe had nothing to go on as 
such, except his local knowledge. 
Naturally the County Police had 
been notified, searches and checks 
were being made in all the sur- 
rounding districts. But Sgt. Slo- 
combe had ideas of his own. In a 
small community like Maxcombe 
Parva news travels fast, and some- 
one had mentioned to him only 
a few minutes ago that Geoff Rye 
was in the ^Tup and Pistol/’ 
spending more money than he’d 
seen for many a long year. Geoff 
with a lot of money was a factor 
which always interested him, so 
Sgt. Slocombe strolled through the 
gnat-filled summer twilight and 
pushed open the door to the Pub- 
lic Bar of the Dog and Gun, long 
ago christened the Pup and Pistol 
by its regulars. 

Ther bar was full of smoke and 
conversation, and Sergeant Slo- 
combe immediately made out Geoff 
Rye leaning against the bar, 
clutching a half-empty tankard in 



his fist, a gigantic cigar blazing 
like a miniature bonfire in his 
mouth, with an admiring crowd of 
locals around him listening to tho 
story he was telling. 

Sgt. Slocombe crossed over to 
this group, and the conversation 
suddenly and miraculously stopped. 
Geoff Rye looked at the sergeant 
and grinned companionably. 

"How do, Bert,” he declared 
with a grin. "You drinking?” 

"Not on duty, Geoff, you know 
that,” Sgt. Slocombe replied. He 
looked around him. "Been buying 
drinks for all these people, then, 
Geoff?” 

"Ar.” 

"Very sociable of you, isn’t it?” 

"Ar.” 

"Come into some money, have 
you?” 

"Ar.” 

It very much appeared that 
Geoff was not in the most communi- 
cative of moods, so Sergeant Slo- 
combe took him by the elbow and 
said, "Come on, Geoff,^! think you 
and I had better go and have a 
little talk.” 

Geoff grinned. Then he downed 
the last of his pint and followed 
the sergeant out of the bar and 
into the carpark, where they both 
sat down together on the low stone 
wall and listened for a time in si- 
lence to the hum of the insects in 
the dying day. 

"\^o have you done this time, 
thei?” asked the sergeant.

''I don’t know what you mean.” 
^^Oh, come on, Geoff,” continued 
the sergeant, cheerfully enough. 

We’ve both known each other for 
years. If you suddenly produce a 
fat wad of notes, we all know you 
didn’t dig it up in your back gar- 
den. Who have you done?” 

^'I’m not saying a word,” Geoff 
replied, idly drawing a pattern 
with his shoe in the gravel of the 
carpark. 

^^Look, Geoff, you know as well 
as I do that I can’t do anything 
unless someone makes a formal 
charge, so you needn’t worry. We’ve 
both got pretty well the same opin- 
ion of the tourists, so why don’t 
you tell me? If they do make a 
charge, you’ve had it anyway.” 
'^Why are you so interested?” 
asked Geoff, eyeing him shrewdly 
in the twilight. 

Qgt. Slocombe shrugged. There 
^ are circumstances,” he an- 
nounced rather officially, about 
this particular case that are a lit- 
tle unusual.” 

'^Which ones?” 

'T’ll tell you in a minute. Now 
who did you do?” 

Geoff shrugged. 'T don’t see as 
how it’ll matter to tell you, Bert,” 
he said casually. Though I don’t 
think this one will complain. He 
seemed too satisfied.” 

''Who was he?” asked the ser- 
geant. "Anyone you’ve seen before? 
American? European?” 



"Oh, I don’t know who the fel- 
low was, ’’Geoff replied, spreading 
his hands and hunching his shoul- 
ders in a massive shrug. "He spoke 
English well enough, but with a 
bit of an accent. He was one of 
them foreigners all right, but I 
couldn’t tell you where from.” 
"All right then, what did you 
sell him? The Town Hall clock 
again?” 

Geoff grinned. "No, Bert, that’s 
old stuff. This chap would’ve 
bought anything.” He drew closer 
to the sergeant and winked con- 
spiratorially. "Personally I’m of 
the opinion he was drunk.” 

"Why?” 

"He’d have to have been drunk 
to take what I gave him.” 

Sergeant Slocombe sighed. "And 
just what was that, Geoff?” he 
asked heavily. 

"Well, he said he wanted souve- 
nirs, right? But he acted as if 
everything was strange to him — 
everything, cars, clothes, furni- 
ture, the lot. I don’t know what 
country he came from, but they 
couldn’t have had very much. Ex- 
cept money. He said the cars were 
fascinating, so I sold him six.” Six? 
Mentally Sgt. Slocombe sat up. 
"And he couldn’t get over our fun- 
ny clothes, as he called them, so I 
said he could have his pick of the 
ones in John White’s shop, and the 
furniture in Martin’s, and ... oh 
I don’t know. I was enjoying my- 
self too much to remember what I

said. But he wrote it all down in a 
little book, and seemed very ex- 
cited. Kept telling me how gener- 
ous we were, to sell all these things 
to a visitor.” Geoff sniggered. 

Don’t know how he thought he 
was going to collect them.” 
Sergeant Slocombe was feeling 
unaccountably worried. Geoff,” he 
s€ud slowly, that’s what I came 
to see you about. Six cars disap- 
peared today. I don’t know about 
the rest.” He had a strange premo- 
nition that back at the police sta- 
tion they would at this moment be 
filling in reports about burglaries 
at White’s and Martin’s and else- 
where. 

Geoff’s grin had disappeared 
like magic. ^^But he canH have,” 
he said. '^How do you take away 
six cars? It must be coincidence.” 
^Tossibly.” Slocombe got to his 
feet. ^'But I think we ought to see 
this foreign fellow, whoever he is. 
Do you know where he’s staying?” 
Geoff shook his head. ^^No,” he 
said. ^^He said he was leaving al- 
most at once. Said he landed over 
there, past Druid’s Wood. I kept 
thinking he might be some Arab 
sheik or something, didn’t know 
cars or that, lots of money, and he 
was all dark and suntanned. I 
thought he probably meant he had 
his own private helicopter, per- 
haps.” He stopped, worried. 

''Let’s go and see,” said Ser- 
geant Slocombe. We might get a 
clue or something.” 



'^hey drove in Sergeant Slo- 
^ combe’s car to as near as they 
were able to Druid’s Wood, then 
continued on foot. The wood in 
fact was a sort of circle of trees; 
there had always been a great 
cleared space in the very center, 
and it was towards this that they 
walked. When they stepped out of 
the surrounding trees, they both 
stopped in silent astonishment and 
indeed some fear. All the vegeta- 
tion, the grass, the bushes, the 
shrubs, in this clearing to a diame- 
ter of a hundred yards or more was 
squashed flat as if by some gigan- 
tic weight, the grass around this 
perimeter blown outwards around 
the huge circle as if by a hurricane- 
strength wind. The trees on the 
edge of the clearing were shredded 
of leaves, and the bark facing it had 
been peeled in places, and lay in 
thin wafers on the ground. 

Blimey I” murmured Geoff Rye. 

"That would have to have been 
a bigger helicopter than you or I 
have ever seen,” commented Ser-

geant Slocombe, scared despite him- 
self. ” Something enormous has 
landed here and taken off again. 
I don’t know who your man was 
that you thought you’d swindled, 
but it looks very much as if he’s 
collected, and he has the machinery 
to do it with.” He turned round, to 
see Geoff as pale as death, his eyes 
staring in a kind of horror. '^What 
is the matter?” he snapped, urgent- 
ly now. 

''Do you think he’ll collect?” 
whimpered Geoff almost soundless- 
ly- 

"He already has done.” 

Geoff sank to the floor, moaning 
softly. 



"I thought he was mad, Sarge, 
really,” he said. 

Slocombe grabbed him by the 
shirtfront with more force than he 
had used on anyone in years and 
hauled him to his feet. 

"What did you do?” he hissed 
fiercely. 

"He said our way of government 
was so archy . what’s the word, 
means old?” 

"Archaic?” 

Yes. Said it fascinated him.” 

"So?” 

"So, I think I got carried away.

<C''T''wenty thousand years ago,” 
said Cultural Attache Pen- 
nyfool, “this, unless I miss my guess, 
was the capital city of a thriving 
alien culture.” 



The half dozen Terrans — mem- 
bers of a Field Expeditionary 
Group of the Corps Diplomatique 
Terrestrienne — stood in the crater 
of a narrow strip of turquoise- 
color^ sward that wound between 
weathered slabs of porous, orange

masonry, rusting spires of twisted 
metal to which a few bits of colored 
tile still clung, and anonymous 
mounds in which wildflowers nod- 
ded alien petals under the light of a 
swollen orange sun. 

“Imagine,” Consul Magnan said 
in an awed tone, as the party 
strolled on through a crumbling 
arcade and across a sand-drifted 
square. “At a time when we were 
still living in caves, these creatures 
had already developed automats 
and traffic jams.” He sighed. “And 
now they’re utterly extinct. The 
survey’s life detectors didn’t so 
much as quiver.” 

“They seem to have progressed 
from neon to nuclear annihilation 
in record time.” Second Secretary 
Retief commented, “But I think 
we have a good chance of bettering 
their track record.” 

“Think of it, gentlemen,” Penny- 
fool called, pausing at the base of a 
capless pylon and rubbing his 
hamds together with a sound like a 
cicada grooming its wing-cases. “An 
entire city in pristine condition — 
nay, more, a whole continent, a 
complete planet I It’s an archeolo- 
gist’s dream come true I Picture the

axes and telly sets, the implements 
of bone and plastic, the artifacts

cans, the beer bottles, the bones —

Emerging into the light of day

their tales of the life and demise 
of a culture 1” 

“If they’ve been dead for twenty 
thousand years, what’s the point in 
digging around in their garbage 
dumps?” an assistant Military 
Attache inquired sotto voce, “I say 
Corps funds would be better spent 
running a little nose-to-ground re- 
connaissance of Boge, or keeping 
an eye on the Groaci.” 

“Tsk, Major,” Magnan said. 
“Such comments merely serve to 
reinforce the popular stereot}q)e of 
the crassness of the military mind.” 
“What’s so crass about keeping 
abreast of the opposition?” the of- 
ficer protested. “It might be a nice 
change if we hit them first, for 
once, instead of getting clobbered 
on the ground.” 

“Sirl” Magnan tugged at the ir- 
idium-braided lapels of his Hver- 
colored informal field coverall. 
“Would you fly in the face of six 
hundred years of tradition?” 
“Now, gentlemen,” Pennyfool 
was saying, “we’re not here to carry 
out a full-scale dig, of course, mere- 
ly to conduct a preliminary survey. 
But I see no reason why we should 
not wet a line, so to speak. Mag- 
nan, suppose you just take one of 
these spades and we’ll poke about 
a bit. But carefully, mind you. We 
wouldn’t want to damage an irre- 
placable art treasure.”

said as his superior offered him the 
shovel. “What perfectly vile luck

condition known as Motorman^s 
Arm — ” 

‘‘A diplomat who can^t bend his 
elbow?” the other replied briskly. 
“Nonsense.” He thrust the imple- 
ment at Magnan. 

44/^utrageous,” the latter mutter- 
ed as his superior moved out 
of earshot, scanning the area for a 
likely spot to commence. “I thought 
I was volunteering for a relaxing 
junket, not being dragooned to 
serve as a navvy.” 

“Your experience in digging 
through Central Files should serve 
you in good stead, Mr. Magnan,” 
Second Secretary Retief said. “Let’s 
just pretend we’re after evidence of 
a political prediction that didn’t pan 
out by someone just above you on 
the promotion list.” 

“I resent the implication that I 
would stoop to such tactics,” Mag- 
nan said loftily. “In any case, only 
an idiot would go on record with 
guesswork.” He eyed Retief oblique- 
ly. “I,, ah, don’t suppose you know 
of any such idiot?” 

“I did,” Retief said. “But he just 
made Ambassador.” 

“Aha!” Penny fool caroled from 
a heavily silted doorway flanked by 
a pair of glassless openings. “A well- 
nigh intact structure, quite possibly 
a museum. Suppose we just take a 
peek.” The diplomats trailed their 
enthusiastic leader as he scrambled 
through into a roofless chamber 



with an uneven, dirt-drifted floor 
and bare walls from which the 
plaster had long since disappeared. 
Along one side of the room a flat- 
topped ridge projected a foot above 
the ground. Pennyfool poked a fin- 
ger at a small mound atop it, ex- 
posing a lumpy object. 

“Eureka!” he cried, brushing 
dirt away from his find. “You see, 
gentlemen? I’ve already turned up 
a masterpiece of the Late Mere- 
tricious!” 

“I say, sir,” a plump Third Sec- 
retary addressed the expedition’s 
leader. “Since Verdigris is a virgin 
world, and we’re the first beings to 
set foot here since its discovery, 
how does it happen the era already 
has a name?” 

“Simple, my boy,” Pennyfool 
snapped. “I just named it.” 

“Look here, sir,” an eager infor- 
mation Agency man who had been 
poking at the find said, “I think 
there’s been an error. This place 
isn’t a museum, its a lunch counter. 
And the masterpiece is a plate of 
petrified mashed potatoes and mum- 
mified peas.” 

“By jove, I think you’ve got 
something there. Quagmire,” a port- 
ly Admin Officer said. “Looks just 
like the stuff they served at the 
Testimonial Dinner for Ambassa- 
dor Clawhammer — ” 

“He’s right,” Magnan announced 
from his position farther down the 
line. “Here’s a side-order of french 
fries.”

yellowish light flooded the room. 

“To stop where you are! ” A weak 
voice hissed the words in a breathy 
.alien tongue from behind the dele- 
gation. “To raise your digital mem- 
bers above your cephalic nodules 
or to be incinerated on the spot!” 

II 

A spindle-legged creature in a 
flaring helmet and sequinned 
greaves emerged from the deep 
shadow of the door, aiming a scat- 
ter gun carelessly at Magnan’s 
knees. 

“What’s this?” Pennyfool’s voice 
cracked on the words. “Groaci? 
Here?” 

“Indeed, Soft One,” the alien 
confirmed. “To comply at once with 
my instructions or to add your 
osseous components to those al- 
ready interred here!” 



Other gun-toting creatures 
appeared from alcoves and behind 
columns, closed in, clacking horny 
mandibles threateningly. 

“See here. Captain,” Pennyfool 
said in a high nervous voice to a 
larger than average Groaci in 
jeweled eye-shields who carried no 
weapon but an ornamental side 
arm. “What’s the meaning of this 
unwarranted interference with a 
peaceful party of duly authorized 
official personnel of the Corps 
Diplomatique Terrestrienne?” 

“The meaning, Mr. Pennyfool,” 
the officer replied in accent-free 
Terran, “is that you are anticipated, 
forestalled, preceded.” He casually 
waved a dope-stick in a foot-long 
ivory holder. “You are interlopers, 
trespassers on Groacian real estate. 
You note that out of delicacy I re- 
frain from use of the term ‘in- 
vaders.’ ” 

“Invaders? We’re scientists! Art- 
lovers! And — ” 

“To be sure,” the captain cut 
him off curtly. “However, it will 
be necessary for you to indulge 
these fancies elsewhere. Verdigris, 
as an unoccupied planet, has been 
claimed by my government. Un- 
fortunately, we are at present un- 
able to issue tourist visas to the 
curious. You will therefore repair 
at once to your vessel, pay the ac- 
cumulated landing fees, demurrage, 
fines for illegal x>arking and lift- 
tax and be on your way.” 

“This is an outrage, you five-

eyed bandit 1” the assistant military 
attiuiie yelled, thrusting to the fore. 
“This planet was discovered by a 
Corps scouting vessel! It belongs to 
usl” 

“I shall overlook your tone, 
Major/^ the Groad whispered acid- 
ly, “induced no doubt by envy at 
my racers superior (^tical endow- 
ments and simply inquire whether 
any Terran daim to tie world was 
ever registered with the appropriate 
tribunals?” 

“Of course not,” Pennyfool 
snapped. “We didn’t want every 
claim-jumping Tom, Dick and Ir- 
ving in this end of the Arm swarm- 
ing in here to see what they could 
loot!” 

“An unfortunate oversight.” 

“But the Survey boat planted a 
claim beacon. You must have seen 
it.” 

“Dear me, now that you men- 
tion it I seem to recall my chaps 
vaporizing some sort of electronic 
noise-maker which was interfering 
with radio reception. Too bad that 
not a trace remains.” 

“That’s a gross violation of Inter- 
planetary Rules!” 

“So? Possession is nine points of 
the law, Mr. Pennyfool. But 
enough of these pleasantries; at the 
moment, the matter of accounts 
receivable requires our attention. 
I’m sure you’re eager to clear up the 
trifling indebtedness and be about 
your no doubt legitimate activities 
dsewhere.” 



“How . how much,” Pennyfool 
asked, “is this going to cost us?” 
“If one of you will hand over 
twenty-two thousand six hundred 
and four galactic credits — cash, no 
checks, please — you can be on 
your way.” 

'^wenty-two thousand!” Penny- 
^ fool choked on the words. 
“That’s highway robbery!” 

“Plus an additional thousand 
penalty fee for each insult,” the 
captain added in an ominous whis- 
per. “And of course I need not 
remind you that the demurrage 
charges are piling up minute by 
minute.” 

“That’s out of the question,” 
Pennyfool gasped. “I have no such 
amount in my possession! We’re 
a scientific expedition, not a party 
of bank messengers!” 

“Too bad,” the captain whis- 
pered. “In that case ...” He made 
a curt gesture; ariried troops step- 
ped forward, guns at the ready. 

“Stop!” Magnan yelped. “You 
can’t just shoot diplomats down in 
cold blood!” 

“Since higher organisms sudi as 
myself employ no vascular fluids, I 
am under no such restraint,” the 
captain pointed out. “However, I 
agree it would be less than couth 
to fail to observe the forms. Accord- 
ingly, I shall refer the matter to my 
chici.” He murmured a word to a 
soldier, who slung his weapon and 
hurried away. The captain saunter- 



m 



IF 




ed off, humimng a gay little tune to 
himself. 

“Verdigris was supposed to be the 
best-kept secret of the year,” Pen- 
nyfool muttered brokenly to Mag- 
nan, “Who would have dreamed the 
Groaci would be here ahead of us?” 

“They couldn’t have found it by 
accident,” the Information Agency 
man said glumly. “Coincidences 
like that don’t happen.” 

“You’re right, Crouchwell,” Pen- 
ny fool said, staring around at his 
staff. “Gentlemen — somebody 
leaked I ” 

“Well, gracious, don’t look at me, 
sir,” Magnan said, an indignant ex- 
pression pinching his narrow fea- 
tures. “7 hardly breathed a word, 
except to a few highly respected 
colleagues.” 

“Colleagues?” Peimyfool raised 
a pale eyebrow. 

“Fellow diplomats; high-type 
chaps like Ambassador P’Yim-Yim 
of Yill and Slunk the Fustian Min- 
ister, and . and ...” 

^‘And?” Penny fool prompted. 

“And Consul-General Shilth,” 
Magnan finished weakly. 

“Planetary Director Shilth, if you 
don’t mind,” a voice susurrated 
from the doorway. 

'^here was a stir among the 
troops ringing in the Terrans. 
A tall Groaci in an elaborately rib- 
bed hip-cloak strolled forward, 
waved jauntily at Magnan, nodded 
to Pennyfool. 

RETIEF, THE LONG-AWAITED MASTER 



“Well, gentlemen, good of you to 
pay a courtesy call,” he said 
smoothly. 

“Consul-General Shilth,” Mag- 
nan said in a hurt tone. “I never 
dreamed you’d be so uncouth as to 
betray a confidence.” 

Shilth frowned, an expression he 
achieved by crossing two pairs of 
eyes. “No?” he said in a surprised 
tone. “Why not?” He vibrat^ his 
throat sac in a manner analogous 
to throat-clearing. “By the way, 
Pennyfool, just what was it you ex- 
pected to find here?” His whisper 
was elaborately casual. 

“You’re standing in the center of 
a treasure house,” Pennyfool said 
sourly, “and you have the con- 
founded gall to ask me that?” 

“My chaps have devoted the bet- 
ter part of the past ten hours to 
fruitless scrabbling in these ruins,” 
Shilth hissed. “They’ve turned up 
nothing of the remotest utility.” 

“You’ve allowed your troops to 
dig here at random?” Pennyfool 
yelped. 

“Ahal” Shilth wagged an accusa- 
tory tentacle. “In spite ©f your 
subtle dissembling, your reaction 
proves that treasures do indeed lie 
beneath this wilderness.” His tone 
became crisp. “Kindly i^cify pre- 
cisely what it is we’re looking for, 
and I might — might mind you — 
find a way to reduce your port 
fees.” 

“You... you assassin I” Penny- 
fool yelled. “You have no right to 

133 




so much as set foot on this hal- 
lowed ground!” 

‘^Still — I am here,” Shilth said 
blandly. “And I see nothing in 
these rubble-heaps to excite CDT 
interest.” He stirred a heap of pot- 
sherds, bottle caps and broken 
phonograph records with a horny 
foot. “Ergo, there must be a sub- 
tler prize awaiting the lucky finder.” 
“Shilth, you Vandal I” Penny- 
fool yelped. “Have you no rever- 
ence for anything?” 

“Try me with gold,” the Groaci 
said succinctly. 

“YouVe out of your mind, you 
Philistine! IVe told you I don’t 
have amy cash on hand!” 

“You refuse to speak?” Shilth 
turned to the attain. “Thish, I tire 
of the Soft One’s lies and his in- 
sults. Take him out and execute 
him.” Penny fool squealed as the 
guards laid hold of him. 

C^Frxecute him?” Magnan bleat- 
ed. “Couldn’t you just strike 
him off the invitation list for cock- 
tail parties or something?” 

“If it’s gold you’re interested in,” 
Relief suggested, “I’m sure CDT 
Sector HQ will come through with 
a tidy sum in return for Mr. Penny- 
fool’s hide, unbroken.” 

“Splendid notion,” a member 
from the Commercial Section piped 
up. “I’m sure the ransom money — 
t^t is to say, the port fees — will 
be forthcoming the minute they see 
us all bax:k to Sector HQ.” 



“Indeed?” Shilth said in a bored 
tone. “And if I allowed you to de- 
part, what surety would I then have 
that the just indemnities will be 
paid?” 

“You have the word of a diplo- 
mat,” Magnan said promptly. 

“I admire your coolness, Mag- 
nan,” Shilth said with a little bow, 
“essaying jests at such a moment.” 
“I suppose I might consent to go 
alone,” Pennyfool said, blinking his 
eyes rapidly. “Although of course 
I’d prefer to stay on as hostage my- 
self, my rank will undoubtedly be 
helpful in expediting payment.” 
“One may go,” Shilth said in a 
chilling whisper. “That one.” He 
pointed at Relief. Thish stepped for- 
ward, pointing his over-decorated 
hand-gun at the victim. 

“Watch him closely. Captain,” 
Shilth admonished. “He has a rep- 
utation as a trouble-maker. As well 
have him off our hands.” 

As Thish, close beside Relief, 
waved the gun toward the en- 
trance, Relief, with a swift motion, 
swept the weapon from the other’s 
grip, took a step, caught Shilth by 
the neck and backed against the 
wall, the muzzle of the pistol press- 
ed against the hostage’s ventral 
carapace. 

Ill 

CC'^ell your boys to stand fast,” 
^ he said in a conversational 
tone as the Groaci official writhed

IF 




and kicked futily, while the soldiers 
looked on as if paralyzed. “Mr. 
Pennyfool, if you’re ready to board 
ship, I don’t think Planetary Di- 
rector Shilth will voice any objec- 
tion.” 

“My soldiers will shoot you down 
like nesting nid-fowlsl” Shilth 
hissed. 

“In which case I’d be forced to 
pump your thorax full of soft- 
nosed slugs,” Retief said. “I’ve 
heard they penetrate the exo-skele- 
ton and then just ricochet around 
inside until they lose momentum. 
Be interesting to find out if it’s 
true.” 

“I remind you, Pennyfool,” Shilth 
cocked his oculars at the Terran, 
who had not moved, “my lads’ 
scatter-guns are highly disruptive 
to flimsy organisms such as your- 
selves. Disarm your misguided col- 
league, and spare the CDT the ex- 
pense of a mass funeral, no less 
costly for lack of any identifiable 
remains I” 

“Better get moving, sir, before 
some bright lad gets ideas,” Retief 
suggested. 

“They ... we ... I ... ” Penny- 
fool gasped. 

“By no means,” Retief said sooth- 
ingly. “They hold Shilth in far too 
high esteem to see him converted 
into a boiled pudding in the half 
shell.” 

Cautiously, the Terrans sidled 
toward the door. Pennyfool went 
through in a scrambling leap, 

RETIEF, THE LONG-AWAITED AAASTER 



followed closely by his associates. 

“Retief,” Magnan, at the rear ef 
the party said “How are you going 
to get clear? If one of them gets 
behind you — ” 

“Better get aboard, Mr. Mag- 
nan,” Retief cut in “I have an 
idea Mr. Pennyfool won’t dawdle 
around waiting for stragglers.” 

‘‘But — but— ” 

“Captain -Thish, perhaps you’d 
be kind enough to act as escort,” 
Retief said. “Just in case any of the 
boys on the outside leap to con- 
clusions.” 

“To comply,” Shilth whispered 
in Groaci as the officer hesitated. 
‘Xater, to visit this miscreant’s 
crimes upon him in a fashion de- 
vised at leisure. Our leisure, that 
is.” 

Magnan made a gobbling sound 
and disappeared, Thish at his heels. 
Shilth had stopped struggling. The 
Groaci soldiery stood in attitudes 
of alert paralysis, watching for an 
opening. 

It was ten minutes before the 
sound of the Corps vessel’s drive 
rumbled briefly, faded, and was 
gone. 

“And now?” Shilth inquired. “If 
you contemplate a contest of en- 
durance, I remind you that we 
Groaci can carry on for upward of 
ten standard days without so much 
as nictating a membrane. 

“Send them outside,” Retief said. 

Shilth remonstrate, but com- 
plied. A moment later, a shrill but 

135 




unmistakably human yelp sounded 
from beyond the door. Magnan 
appeared in the entry, his arms 
grimed by a pair of Groaci while 
a third held a scatter gun to his 
head. 

“They . they didn’t wait,” the 
diplomat wailed. 

“Release me!” Shilth hissed. 
“Or would you prefer to wait un- 
til after my lads have blown your 
superior’s head off?” 

“Sounds like an even trade,” 
Retief said. Magnan gasped and 
swallowed. 

“Much as I should dislike to see 
the Planetary Director’s internal 
arrangements hashed in the manner 
you so vividly describe,” Thish said 
from behind Magnan, “I assure you 
I would make the sacrifice on the 
interest of the Groaci national 
honor.’' 

“In the interest of his next pro- 
motion, he means,” Shilth hissed. 
“What does he care if I’m diced 
in the process?” 

"O etief thrust Shilth away, tossed 
the gun on the floor. “If I 
didn’t know you wanted both of us 
alive, I’d have called your bluff, 
Thish,” he said. 

“Oh? And do I want you alive, 
Soft One?” Thish took aim with 
a borrowed rifle. 

*T)f course you do, litter-mate of 
genetic inferiors!” Shilth snz^ped, 
massaging the point of his back 
where the gim muzzle had dug in. 



“At least until they divulge the 
secret of what they sought here I” 
He turned to Retief. “And now let 
us to business, eh?” 

Retief plucked a cigar from his 
breast pocket, puffed it alight, blew 
scented smoke past the alien’s 
olfactory orifices, which cinched up 
tight at the aroma of Virginia leaf. 

“Certainly, Shilth. Who’s for sale 
now?” 

“You are, my dear Terry,” the 
Groaci said ominously. “The price 
of your life is a complete descrip- 
tion of the nature and location of 
the riches hidden here.” 

Retief waved the stogie at the 
blotched walls, the dirt-drifted 
corners, the broken tilework. “You 
are looking at them.” 

“Ah, so we are to have the pleas- 
ure of assisting you in developing 
a more cooperative attitude, eh? 
Capital. Easy babblers are such 
bores.” 

“You wouldn’t dare torture us,” 
Magnan said in squeaky tone. 
“Our colleagues know where we are. 
If we aren’t returned imharmed, 
they’ll extract a terrible ven- 
geance!” 

“A sharp note to the Ambassa- 
dor, no doubt,” Shilth said, with 
an amused snap of the mandibles. 
“Still, there are subtler methods of 
persuasion than living dismember- 
ment. Now, we Groaci are quite at 
home in enclosed spaces; but you 
Terries, it is rumored, are claustro- 
phobes, an allegation I’ve often 



136 



IF 




yearned to test. And I know just 
the setting in which to conduct the 
experiment.” He gestured to Thish, 
who urged the two Terrans at gun 
point along a wide passage to a 
metal door. Two soldiers came for- 
ward to wrestle the heavy panel 
aside, exposing a tiny chamber no 
more than six feet on a side, win- 
dowless, unfurnished. 

“Gentlemen, your cell, A trifle 
cramped, perhaps, but well pro- 
tected from excessive wind and rain, 
eh?” 

Retief and Magnan stepped in- 
side. The two soldiers forced the 
heavy sliding door shut. 

In the total darkness, a dim spot 
of light glowed on one wall. Retief 
reached out and pressed a thumb 
against it. 

With a grinding of ancient gears, 
a groaning of antique cables, the 
elevator started down. 

IV 

TiTagnan emitted a shrill cry and 
attempted to climb the wall 
“Retief! What’s happening?” 

“No, no, Mr. Magnan,” Retief 
said, “Your line is, ‘Ah, just as I 
planned.’ That’s the way reputa- 
tions for forethought are built.” 
“Shilth was quite right about the 
claustrophobia,” Magnan said in a 
choked voice. “I feel that the walls 
are going to close in on me!” 
“Just close your eyes and pre- 
tend you’re at a Tuesday morning 



staff meeting. The relief when you 
find yourself here should carry you 
through anything short of utter 
catastrophe.” 

With a shudder and a clank, the 
car came to a halt. 

“N-now what?” Magnan said in 
a small voice. Retief felt over the 
door, found the stub of a lever. He 
gripped it and pulled. Reluctantly, 
the door slid aside on a large, 
column-filled room faintly lit by 
strips of dimly glowing material 
still adhering to the ceiling and 
walls, which were adorned with 
murals depicting grotesque figures 
engaged in obscure rites. 

“Tomb paintings,” Magnan said 
in a hushed voice. “We’re in the 
catacombs. The place is probably 
full of bones — not that I actually 
believe in the curses of dead kings 
or anything.” 

“The curses of live Ambassadors 
are far more potent, I suspect,” 
Retief said, heading the way across 
the room and into one of the many 
passages debouching from the cham- 
ber. Here more cabalistic scenes 
were etched in still-bright colors 
against the ancient walls. Cryptic 
legends in an unknown script were 
blazoned across many of them. 

“They’re probably quotations 
from the local version of the Book 
of the Dead,” Magnan hazarded, 
his eye caught by a yividly pig- 
mented representation of a large 
alien being making what seemed 
to be a threatening gesture at a 



RETIEF, THE LONG-AWAITED MASTER 



137 




second alien from whose ears wisps 
of mist coiled. 

“This one, for example,” he said, 
“no doubt shows us the God of the 
Underworld judging a soul and 
finding it wanting.” 

“Either that, or it’s a NO SMOK- 
ING sign,” Relief agreed. 

The passage turned, branched. 
The left branch dead-ended at an 
ominous-looking sump half filled 
with a glistening black fluid. 

“The sacrificial well,” Magnan 
said with a shudder. “I daresay the 
bottom — goodness knows how far 
down that is — is covered with the 
remains of youths and maidens of- 
fered to the gods.” 

Retief sniffed. “It smells like 
drained crankcase oil.” 

They skirted the pit, came into 
a wide room crowded with massive, 
complex shines of corroded metal, 
ranked in rows in the deep gloom. 

“And these are the alien idols,” 
Magnan whispered. “Gad, they have 
a look of the most frightful ferocity 
about them.” 

“That one,” Retief indicated a 
tall, many-armed monster looming 
before him, “bears a remarkable 
resemblance to a hay-baler.” 

“Mind your tongue, Retief!” 
Magnan said sharply. “It’s not that 
I imagine they can hear us, of 
course, but \diy tempt fate?” 

T here was a sharp click!, a 
whirring and clattering, a stir of 
massive forms all across the gloomy 



chamber. Magnan yipped and leap- 
ed back as a construct the size of 
a fork-lift stirred into motion, 
turned, creaking, and surveyed 
him with a pair of what were in- 
disputably glowing amber eyes. 

"'We’re surrounded,” Magnan 
chirped faintly. “And they told us 
the planet was uninhabited!” 

“It is,” Retief said, as more giant 
shapes moved forward, accompa- 
nied by the squeak of unlubricated 
metal. 

“Then what are these?” Magnan 
came back sharply. “Oversized 
spooks?” 

“Close, but not kewpie doll,” 
Retief said. “This is the city gar- 
age, and these are maintenance ro- 
bots.” 

“R-r-robots?” 

“Our coming in must have trig- 
gered them to come to alert status.” 
They moved along the row of giant 
machines, each equipped with a 
variety of limbs, organs, and sen- 
sors. 

“Then . then they’re probably 
waiting for us to give them orders,” 
Magnan said with returning con- 
fidence. “Retief! Don’t you see 
what this means? We can tell them 
to jump in the lift and ride up and 
scare the nether garments off that 
sticky little Shilth and his army — 
or we could have done,” he added, 
“if they understood Terran.” 

*^Terran under stood , a scratch 
bass voice rasped from a point just 
opposite Magnan’s ear. He leaped

and whirled, banging a shin smart- 

ly. 

^^Retiefl They understand us! 
We’re saved! Good lord, when I 
first planned our escape via the 
lift, I never dreamed we’d have 
such a stroke of luck!” 

^‘Now you’re getting the idea,” 
Retief said admiringly. ‘‘But why 
not just add that extra touch of 
savoir-faire by pretending you’d de- 
duced the whole thing, robots and 
all, from a cryptic squiggle on the 
contact party’s scopegram?” 

“Don’t be crude, Retief,” Mag- 
nan said loftily. “I fully intend to 
share the credit for the coup. In 
my report I’ll mention that you 
pushed the lift button with no 
more than a hint from me.” 
“Maybe you’d better not write 
up that report just yet,” Retief 
said, as a robot directly before 
them shifted position with a dry 
squeal of rusty bearing to squarely 
block their advance. Others closed 
in on either side; they turned to 
find retreat similarly cut off. 

“My, see how eager they are, Re- 
tief,” Magnan said in a comforta- 
ble tone. “There, there, just stand 
aside like a good, er, fellow,” he 
addressed the machine before him. 

It failed to move. Frowning, 
Magnan started around it, was cut 
off by a smaller automaton — this 
one no bigger than a commercial 
sausage grinder, and adorned with 
a similar set of blades visible in- 
side a gaping metallic maw. 



“Well! I see they’re in need of 
re-programming,” Magnan said 
sharply. “It’s all very well to fawn 
a little, but — ” 

“I’m not sure they’re fawning,” 
Retief said. 

“Then what in the world are 
they doing?” 

Terr an are surrounded, a voice 
like broken glass stated from be- 
hind the encircled diplomats. 

“IFe are judging Terran^^ an im- 
oiled tenor stated from the rear 
rank. ^^And finding you wanting,^^

cent of a file on steel. 

“PFe are eager for crude con- 
tact, Broken Glass agreed. 

44'^hey have a curious mode of 
expressing themselves,’^ Mag- 
nan said nervously. “I seem to de- 
tect an almost ominous note in their 
singular choice of words.” 

“I think they’re picking up their 
vocabulary from us,” Retief said. 

“Retief — if it wasn’t so silly, 
I’d think that one intended us bod- 
ily harm,” Magnan said in a tone 
of forced jocularity, as a ponder- 
ous assemblage of sharp edges came 
forward, rumbling. 

“PFe intend you bodily harm^^ 
File-on-Steel said. 

“But — but you can’t attack «5,” 
Magnan protested. “You’re just 
machines! We’re alive! We’re your 
rightful masters!” 



RHIEF, THE LONG-AWAITED MASTER

^^Masters are better than ro- 
bots Broken Glass stated. “Fom 
are not better than us. You are not 
masters. We will certainly harm 
you,^^ 

^^You will not escapey^ a red- 
eyed monster added. 

“Retief, I suspect weVe made a 
blunder,” Magnan said in a wav- 
ering tone. “We were better off at 
the tender mercies of the Groacil” 

“What’s it all about, boys?” Re- . 
tief called over the gathering creak 
and clank as the machines closed 
in. 

^^This planet is not your world. 
We are programmed to give no 
mercies to you fellow.^^ 

“Just a minute,” Magnan pro- 
tested. “We’re just harmless diplo- 
mats. Can’t we all be friends or 
something?” 

“Who gave you your order?” Re- 
tief asked. 

“Owr masters/^ replied a voice 
like a sand-filled gearbox. 

“That was a long time ago,” Re- 
tief said. “Matters have changed 
somewhat.” 

“Yes, indeed,” Magnan chimed 
in, “You see, now that your old 
masters are all dead, we’re taking 
over their duties.” 

“0«r duties are to see you dead,^^ 
Red-eye boomed, raising a pair of 
yard-long cleavers. 

“HelpI” Magnan yelped. 

“We wouldn’t want to stand in 
the way of duty,” Retief said, 
watching the poised cutting edges, 



“but suppose we turned out to be 
your masters after all? I’m sure 
you wouldn’t want to make the mis- 
take of slicing up your legitimate 
owners.” 

“You see, we took over where 
they left off,” Magnan said hasti- 
ly. “We’re, ah, looking after all 
their affairs for them, carrying out 
their wishes as we understand them, 
tidying up — ” 

'^There is no mistakey Terran, 
You are not our masters,^^ 

“You said masters are better 
than robots,” Retief reminded the 
machine. “If we can prove our su- 
periority, will you concede the 
point?” 

V 

S ilence fell, broken only by the 
whir and hum of robotic me- 
tabolisms. 

“// you could so prove, we will 
certainly concede your status as 
our masters,” Sand - in - the - gears 
said at last. 

“Gracious, I should think so!” 
Magnan jerked his rumpled lapels 
into line. “For a moment, Retief, 
I confess I was beginning to feel 
just the teeniest bit apprehensive.” 
*^You have one minute to prove 
your superiority,” Broken Glass 
said flatly. 

“Well, I should think it was ob- 
vious,” Magnan sniffed. “Just look 
at us.” 

^'Indeedy we*ve done so. We jind

you Utile, silly, crude, tender, ap- 
prehensive and harmless!' 

‘‘You mean — ?” 

“It means we’ll have to do some- 
thing even more impressive than 
standing around radiating righteous 
indignation, Mr. Magnan.” 

“Well, for heaven’s sake,” Mag- 
nan sniffed. “I never thought I’d 
see the day when I had to prove 
the obvious ascendancy of a diplo- 
mat over a donkey engine.” 

^'We are waiting," File-on-Steel 
said. 

“Well, what do they expect?” 
Magnan yelped. “It’s true they’re 
bigger, stranger, faster, longer- 
lived, and cheaper to operate; and 
of course they have vast memory 
banks and can do lightning calcu- 
lations and tricks of that sore — 
which, however, can hardly com- 
pare with our unique human abil- 
ity to, ah, do what we do,” he fin- 
ished in a subdued tone. 

**What do you do?" Red-eye de- 
manded. 

“Why, we, ah, demonstrate mor- 
al superiority,” Magnan said 
brightly. 

“Shilth was right about your 
sense of humor,” Retief said ad- 
miringly. “But I think we’d better 
defer the subtle japes until we dis- 
cover whether we’re going to sur- 
vive to enjoy the laugh.” 

“Well for heaven’s sake do some- 
thing, Retief,” Magnan whispered, 
“before they make a terrible blun- 
der.” He rolled his eyes sideways

at a scythe-like implement hover- 
ing as if ready to shear at any in- 
stant through the volume of space 
he occupied. 

^^Time is up," Broken Glass said. 

'^he machines surged forward. 

The scythe, sweeping horizontal- 
ly, clanged against the descending 
cleavers as Retief and Magnan 
jumped aside from the rush of a 
low-slung tree mower with chatter- 
ing blades. The latter swerved, col- 
lided with a massive punch-press, 
one of whose piston-hke - members 
stabbed through the side of a pon- 
derous masonry wrecker. It wobbled, 
did a sharp right turn and slammed 
into the cast-concrete wall, which 
cracked and leaned, allowing a mas- 
sive beam to drop free at one end, 
narrowly missing Magnan as he re- 
bounded from the flank of a charg- 
ing garbage shredder. The falling 
girder crashed across the mid-sec- 
tion of the latter machine with a 
decisive crunch I pinning the hap- 
less apparatus to the spot. It 
clashed its treads futilely, sending 
up a shower of concrete chips. The 
other machines clustered around it 
in attitudes of concern, the Ter- 
rans for the moment forgotten. 

“HsstI Retief! This is our 
chance to beat a strategic with- 
drawal!” Magnan stage-v/hispered. 
“If we can just make it back to 
the elevator — ” 

‘We’ll find Shilth waiting at the 
top,” Retief said. “Mr. Magnan, 

141 




suppose you find a comfortable 
spot behind a packing case some- 
where. I’m not quite ready to leave 
yet.” 

^‘Are you insane? These blood- 
thirsty bags of bolts are ready to 
pound us to putty!” 

“They seem to be fully occupied 
with another problem at the mo- 
ment,” Retief pointed out, nodding 
toward a post-hole digger which 
was fruitlessly poking at the end 
of the beam which had trapped its 
fellow. The scythe-armed robot was 
as busily scraping at the massive 
member, without result. The ranks 
parted to let a heavy-duty paint- 
chipper through; but it merely 
clattered its chisel-tips vainly 
against the impervious material. 
And all the while, the pinioned ma- 
chine groaned lugubriously, sparks 
flying from its commutator box as 
it threshed vainly to pull free. 

Retief stepped forward; Red-eye 
swiveled on him, raising a large 
mallet apparently designed for 
pounding heavy posts into hard 
ground. 

“Before you drive home your ar- 
gument,” Retief said, “I have a 
proposal.” 

^^What proposal?^* 

“You don’t seem to be having 
much luck extricating your col- 
league from under the beam. Sup- 
pose I try.” 

“Owe minute, I will lift the 
heamy^ a deep voice boomed. A 
massively built loading robot trun-

died forward, maneuvered deftly in- 
to position, secured a grip on the 
concrete member with its single 
huge arm and heaved. For a mo- 
ment, nothing happened; then 
there was a sharp clonk! and a 
broken duralloy torque rod dangled 
from the lifter’s forged-steel biceps. 
The girder had not stirred. 

CC'^ough luck, old fellow,” Retief 
said. turn.” 

‘^Good heavens, Retief, if that 
cast-iron Hercules couldn’t do it, 
how can you hope to succeed?” 
Magnan squeaked from his comer. 

"Fow have the ability to help 
our colleague?** Broken Glass de- 
manded. 

“If I do, will you follow my or- 
ders?” 

“// you can do that which we 
cannot do, your superiority is ob- 
vious** 

“In that case, just pull that bar 
out of there, will you?” Retief 
pointed to a four-inch diameter 
steel rod, twenty feet long, part of 
a roller assembly presumably once 
used in loading operations. A stack- 
ing machine gripped the rod and 
gave it a firm pull, ripping it free 
from its mountings. 

“Stick one end under the edge 
of the beam, like a good fellow,” 
Retief said. “You there, jack-ham- 
mer: push that anvil under the rod, 
eh?” The machines complied with 
his requests with brisk efficiency, 
adjusting the lever as directed, with 

RETIEF, THE LONG-AWAITED MASTER 



the fulcrum as close as possible to 
the weight to be lifted. 

“Retief — if you couldn’t even 
lift the lever how are you going 
to .... ” Magnan’s voice faded as 
Retief stepped up on the tread- 
skirt of a sand-blaster and put a 
foot on the up-angled long arm of 
the jury-rigged pry-bar. Steadying 
himself, he let his full weight onto 
the rod. Instantly, it sank grace- 
fully down, lifting the multi-ton 
beam a full half-inch from the de- 
pression it had imprinted in the 
garbage shredder. TTie latter made 
a clanking sound, attempted to 
move, emitted a cascade of elec- 
trical sputterings and subsided. 

“He’s ruptured himself I” Mag- 
nan gasped. “Poor thing. Still, 
we’ve done our part.” 

The other madiines were maneu- 
vering, making way for a squat car- 
go-tug, which backed up to the vic- 
tim, but was unable to get in po- 
sition to attach its tow-cable. A 
dirt-pusher with a wide blade tried 
next, but in the close quarters 
failed to get within six feet of the 
disabled machine. The others had 
no better luck. 

“Mr. Magnan, find a length of 
cable,” Retief called. Magnan rum- 
mag^, turned up a rusting coil of 
braided wire, 

“One of you robots with digits 
tie one end of the cable to the pa- 
tient,” Retief said. “Cinch the oth- 
er up to something that won’t 
give.” 

U2 




minutes later the cable was 
stretched drum tight from a 
massive stanchion to the cripple, 
running between closely-spaced 
paired columns. 

“Next, we apply a transverse 
pull to the center of the cable,” 
Retief directed. 

“They can%” Magnan wailed. 
“There’s no room!” 

“In that case, Mr. Magnan, per- 
haps you’d be good enough to per- 
form the office.” 

“I?” Magnan’s eyebrows went 
up. “Perhaps you’ve forgotten my 
Motorman’s Arm.” 

“Use the other one.” 

“You expect me, one-handed, to 
budge that ten-ton hulk?” 

“Better hurry up. I feel my foot 
slipping.” 

“This is madness,” Magnan ex- 
claimed, but he stepped to the ca- 
ble, gripped it at mid-point, and 
tugged. With a harsh squeak of 
metal, the damaged machine moved 
forward half an inch. 

“Why — why, that’s positively 
astonishing!” Magnan said with a 
pleased look. 

“Tighten the cable and do it 
again!” Retief said quickly. The 
Machines hurried to take up the 
slack. Magnan, with an amazed ex- 
pression, applied a second pull. 
The wreck 'moved another centi- 
meter. After three more nibbles, 
'the tug was able to hook on and 
idrag its fellow clear. Retief jumped 
gown, letting the beam drop with 
144 



an incredible floor-shaking boom! 

“Heavens!” Magnan found his 
voice. “I never imagined I was 
such a brute! After all, the diplo- 
matic life is somewhat sedentary 
. ” He flexed a thin arm, fin- 
gering it in search of a biceps. 

“Wrestling with the conscience 
is excellent exercise,” Retief point- 
ed out. “And you’ve held up your 
end of some rather weighty con- 
versations in your time.” 

“Jape if you must,” Magnan 
said coolly. “But you can’t deny I 
did free the creature. Er, machine, 
that is.” 

^^You have freed our colleague,*^ 
Sand-in-the-gears said to Mag- 
nan. *We are waiting for your or- 
ders, Master.^* 

“To be sure,” Magnan placed 
his fingertips together and pursed 
his lips. “You won’t fit into the 
lift,” he said j*udiciously, looking 
over his new subj’ects. “Is there an- 
other way up?” 

“To be sure. Master.” 
“Excellent. I want all of you to 
ascend to the surface at once, 
round up and disarm every Groaci 
on the planet, and lock them up. 
And see that you don’t squash the 
one called Shilth in the process. I 
have a little gloating to do.” 

VI 

/^n a newly excavated terrace un- 
der a romantically crumbling 
wall of pink brick, Magnan and 

IF 




Relief sat with Shilth, the latter 
wearing a crestfallen expression in- 
volving quivering anterior mandi- 
bles and drooping eye-stalks. His 
daborate cloak of office was gone, 
and there were smudges of axle 
grease on his once-polished thorax. 

‘‘Dirty pool, Magnan,” the Gro- 
aci said, his breathy voice fainter 
than ever. “I was in line for the 
Order of the Rubber Calipers, Sec- 
ond Class, at the very least, and 
you ^iled it all with your per- 
ambulating junk-yard. Who would 
have dreamed you^d been so sly as 
to secretly conceal a host of war- 
machines? I suspect you did it 
merely to embarrass me.” 

“Actually,” Magnan began, and 
paused. “Actually, it was quite 
shrewd of me, now that you men- 
tion it.” 

“I think you overdid the camou- 
flage, however,” Shilth said acidly 
as a street-broom whiffled past, 
casting a shower of dust over the 
party. “The confounded things 
don’t appear to be aware that the 
coup is over. They’re still carrying 
on the charade.” 

“I like to keep my lads occupied,” 
Magnan said briskly, nodding 
grandly at a hauler trundling past 
along the newly cleaned avenue 
with a load of newly uprooted brush. 
“Hielps to keep them in trim in case 
they’re needed suddenly to quell 
any disturbances.” 

“Neva* fear, I’ve impressed on 
Thish that he will not long sur- 
RETIEF, THE LONG-AWAITED MASTER 



vive any thneat to my well-being.” 
“Company coming,” Relief said, 
gesturing toward a descending point 
of sun-bright bine light. They 
watched the ship settle in to a land- 
ing a quarter of a mile distant, then 
rose and strolled over to greet the 
emerging passengers. 

“Why, it’s Mr. Penny fool,” Mag- 
nan said. “I knew he’d be along to 
rescue us. Yoo-hoo, Mr. Penny- 
fool!” 

“That’s Mr. Ambassador, Mag- 
nan,” Pennyfool corrected sharply. 
“Kindly step aside. You’re interfer- 
ing with a delicate negotiation.” The 
little man marched past Relief with- 
out a glance, halted before Shilth, 
offering a wide smile and a limp 
hand. The Groad studied the latter, 
tinned it over gingerly and exam- 
ined the back, then dropped it. 

44T iver spots,” he said. “How 
^ unesthetic.” 

“Now, Planetary Director Shilth, 
we’re prepared to offer a handsome 
fee in return for exploratory rights 
here on Verdigris.” Pennyfool re- 
stored his smile with an effort. “Of 
course, anything we find will be 
turped over to you at once — ” 
“Oh, ah, Mr. Ambassador,” Mag- 
nan hazarded. 

“We Groad,” Shilth said sourly, 
“are not subject to such pigmen- 
tational disorders. We remain a 
uniform, soothing puce at all times.” 
“Sir,” Magnan piped up. “I’d just 
Uke — ” 

145 




^^Now, naturally, we’re prepared 
to underwrite a generous program 
of planetary development to assist 
your people in settling in,” Penny- 
fool hurried on. “I had in mind 
about a half a billion to start ...” 
He paused to gauge reaction. “Per 
year, of course,” he amended, 
judging the omens, “with adequate 
bonuses for special proj‘ects, natural- 
ly. Now, I’d say a staff of say two 
hundred to begin with . ?” 
“Pennyfool, I have a dreadful 
node-ache,” Shilth hissed. “Why 
don’t you go jump down an elevator 
shaft?” He patted back a counter- 
feit yawn and stalked away. 

“Well, I can see that this is going 
to be a challenge,” Pennyfool said, 
staring after the alien. “The tricky 
fellow is going to hold out for two 
billion, no doubt.” 

“Mr. Ambassador, I have good 
news,” Magnan said hastily. “We 
can save the taxpayers those bil- 
lions. Verdigris belongs to me!” 
“See here, Magnan, the privation 
can’t have scrambled your meager 
wits already! You’ve only been here 
seventy- two hours!” 

“But, sir — there’s no need to 
promise Shilth the moon — ” 
“Aha! So that’s what he’s holding 
out for. Well, I see no reason the 
negotiation should founder over a 
mere satellite.” Pennyfool turned 
to pursue Shilth. 

“No, no, you don’t quite grasp 
my meaning,” Magnan yipped, 
grabbing at his superior’s sleeve. 
146 



“Unhand me, Magnan!” Penny- 
fool roared. “I’ll see to your release 
after other, more vital matters are 
dealt with. In the meantime, I sug- 
gest you set a good example by 
cobbling a record number of shoes, 
or whatever task they’ve set 
you — ” 

“Master, is this person troubling 
you?” a torn-metal voice inquired. 
Magnan and Pennyfool whirled to 
see a rust covered hedge-clipper 
looming over them, four-foot-clip- 
pers at the ready. 

“No, that’s quite all right, Al- 
bert,” Magnan said acidly. “I like 
being bullied.” 

“You’re quite certain you don’t 
wish him trimmed to a uniform 
height? 

“No. I just want him to listen 
to what I have to say.” 

Albert clacked the shears together 
with a nerve-shredding sound. 

“I — I’d love to listen to you, my 
dear Magnan,” Pennyfool said 
rapidly. 

AyTagnan delivered a brief ac- 
count of his capture of the 
planet. “So you see, sir,” he con- 
cluded, “the whole thing is Terran 
property.” 

“Magnan!” Pennyfool roared, 
then with a glance at Albert lowered 
his voice to a whisper. “Do you 
realize what this means? When I 
reported the Groaci here ahead of 
us, I was appointed as Terran 
Ambassador Extraordinary and 

IF 




Minister Plenipotentiary to the con- " 
founded place! If we own it, then 
pfft! There goes my appointment!” 

“Great heavens, sir,” Magnan 
paled at the announcement. “I had 
no idea!” 

“Look here, do you suppose we 
could get the Groaci to take it 
back?” 

“What, stay here, surrounded by 
these mobile moldy monstrosities?” 
Shilth, who had returned silently, 
hissed. “Never! I demand repatria- 
tion!” 

Retief caught Magnan’s eye as 
Pennyfool turned to soothe the 
Groaci. 

“What is it, Retief? Can’t you 
see I’m at a critical point, career- 
wise?” 

“I have a suggestion,” Retief 
said. 

As Magnan rejoined Pennyfool, 
Shilth was still hissing imprecations. 

“Master, what say I prune this 
fellow a bit?” Albert proposed. “He 
seems to have sprouted too many 
eyes.” 

“Not unless he says another 
word,” Magnan said. He turned to 
Pennyfool with a thoughtful look. 
“I say, sir, suppose I should come 
up with a scheme which will insure 
you confirmation, and which will 
at the same time reflect favorably 
on the Terran image? You know, 
the kindly, selfless, helping-hand 
sort of thing?” 

*^es, yes?” 

“I daresay once established here, 

RETIEF, THE LONG-AWAITED MASTER 




you’d want to surround yourself 
with a staff widely versed in local 
problems — ” 

“Naturally. Tliere are plenty of 
reliable team-men available doing 
Underground research work in sub- 
terranean libraries back at Sector. 
Get on with it, Magaan.’’ 

“I want the Counsellorship,” 
Magnan said crisply. 

“You, number two man in my 
Embassy? Ridiculous! Pd have to 
jump you over the heads of men 
with vast experience under their 
belts!” 

“Most of my experience has been 
at a somewhat higher level,” Mag- 
nan said loftily. ‘‘No Counsellor- 
sliip^ no scheme.” 

‘‘What’s this, Magnan, black- 
mail?” Pennyfool gasped. 
“Precisely,” Magnan said. 
Pennywise opened his mouth to 
yell^ then closed it and nodded. 

“Magnan, it’s apparent you’re 
more familiar with the techniques 
of diplomacy than I suspected. I 
accept. Now, just what do you have 
in mind?” 

VII 

4 4Tt’s a bit unusual,” Ambassa- 
^ dor Pennyfool said compla- 
cently, glancing out the window of 
his freshly refurbish^ office on the 
top floor of a newly excavated tower 
of green-anodized aluminum serving 
as CDT chancery. “But on the 
other hand, it is a challenge.” 



“Gracious, yes,” Counsellor Mag- 
nan said, nodding. “The first 
Terran envoy to present credentials 
to a mechanical Head of State. 

“I don’t know,” the Military 
Attache said darkly. “Freeing these 
inanimate objects and letting them 
set up in business for themselves 
may create a dangerous precedent. 
What if my cybernetic military 
equipment, for example, should 
start getting ideas about pensions 
and promotions?” 

“^d office machines,” the Bud- 
get and Fiscal Officer said worried- 
ly. “If my bookkeeping computers 
took it into their transistors to start 
agitating for civil rights I shudder 
to contemplate the consequences in 
terms of, say, late pay checks.” 
“I’m already having trouble with 
my Motor Pool picking up liberal 
ideas,” the Admin Officer wagged 
his head, frowning. “I’ve had to 
enact strict rules against fraterniza- 
tion with the natives.” 

There was a musical chime from 
the desk screen. The square-cor- 
nered sense-organ panel of Plane- 
tary Secretary Albert Sand-in-the- 
Gears appeared. 

“Ah, there, Pemiyfool,” the ro- 
botic Chief of State said in a tone 
as genial as his vocal equipment 
would allow. “I hoped I’d find you 
in. I was just ringing up to ask 
whether you’d care to join me on 
the links this afternoon for a few 
holes of ballistic golf.” 

“I’m sorry, Mr. President,” the

Terran said shortly. game in 
which one is required to score eight 
holes-in-one out of ten from a tee 
seven miles from the green is not 
my strong suit.” 

“Of course. I keep forgetting 
you’re not equipped with telescopic 
sights. A pity.” The President 
sighed, a sotmd like tearing steel. 
“It was difficult enough grasping 
the idea of the superiority of my 
inferiors; trying to behave as equals 
is even more trying. No offense in- 
tended, of course.” 

“Mr. President — who’s that sit- 
ting behind you?” Penny fool asked 
sharply. 

“Ah, forgive me. This is Special 
Trade Representative Shilth, of 
Groac. His government has sent him 
along to assist in getting the Ver- 
digrian economy rolling.” 

“How long has he been here?” 

44 T ong enough to demonstrate 
my indispensability,” Shilth 
leaned forward to leer at the Ter- 
rans. “I’ve already concluded 
Trade Agreements with a number 
of hard currency markets for ex- 
port of Verdigrian antiquities.” 
“You didn’t,” Pennyfool gasped. 
“Oh, have no fear, they’re not 
the real thing.” Shilth waggled an 
eye at Magnan, who pretended not 
to notice. “Though we let it be 
noised about that they’re all boot- 
leg National Treasures.” 

“Oh, I see. Reproductions?” 
Pennyfool grunted. “Just so you 
RETIEF, THE LONG-AWAITED MASTER 



don’t ship any irreplacable objets 
d’arte off-planet.” 

“We won’t. We require them as 
patterns for the matter duplicat- 
ors.” 

“Eh?” 

“The locals are digging them out 
by the truckload; they sort them, 
discard the rejects — broken pots 
and the like — then scrub up the 
choice items and send them along 
to the duplication centers. We al- 
ready have a dozen plants in full 
swing. Our ceramic fingering-knobs 
are already a sensation with the 
cultured set. In a year Verdigris will 
be known as the antique capital 
of the Eastern Arm.” 

“Matter duplicators? You’re 
flooding the Galaxy with bogus 
antiques?” 

“Bogus? They’re identical with 
the real thing, to the last mole- 
cule.” 

“Hahl The genuine articles are 
priceless examples of Verdigrian 
art; the copies are just so much 
junkl” 

“But, my dear Pennyfool — ^if one 
can’t distinguish a masterpiece from 
a piece of junk . ?” 

“/ can detect the genuine at a 
glance 1 ” 

“Show me,” the Groaci said, and 
whipped out a pair of seemingly 
identical shapes of lumpy blue- 
glazed clay the size and approxi- 
mate shape of stunted rutabagas. 

“ . but unfortunately, I have 
something in my eye,” Pennyfool 

149 




subsided, poking at the offending 
organ. 

“A pity. I would have enjoyed a 
demonstration of your expertise,” 
Shilth cooed. 

“Well gentlemen, that tears it,” 
the Ambassador said to his staff 
after the screen had blanked. “After 
all my delicate maneuvering to se- 
cure self-determination for these un- 
fortunate relics of a by-gone age, 
and to place the CDT in a position 
of paternal influence vis-a-vis their 
emergent nation, the infernal Gro- 
aci have stolen a march on us again. 
Fake antiques, indeed!” 

“Goodness, I see what you mean, 
Mr. Ambassador,” Magnan said 
sympathetically. “Why didn’t we 
think of doing that?” 

Tn the Chancery corridor ten 
minutes later, Magnan mop- 
ped at his thin neck with a large 
floral-patterned tissue. 

“Heavens, who’d have thought 
he’d fly into such a passion?” he 
inqiared of Retief. “After all, it 
isn’t as if those silly little gobs of 
mud possessed an intrinsic merit.” 
“Oh, I don’t know,” Retief said. 
“They’re not bad, considering that 
the locals have to mass-produce 
them and bury them at night when 
nobody’s looking.” 

“Retief!” Magnan stopped dead. 
“You don’t mean . ?” 



“It seemed like a good idea to 
sidetrack the Groaci away from the 
genuine stuff,” Retief pointed out, 
in a completely serious voice. 
“Just in case any of it had any 
sentimental value.” 

“Fake fakes,” Magnan murmur- 
red. “The concept has a certain 
euphony.” 

They paused beside a pair of 
double doors opening onto an airy 
balcony two hundred feet above the 
freshly scrubbed city. As they 
stepped out, a small copter with a 
saddle and handlebars came wing- 
ing in across the park to hover just 
beyond the balustrade. 

“Hope aboard, Retief, we’re late,” 
the machine called in a cheerful 
baritone. 

“Retief, where are you going?” 
Magnan barked as the latter swung 
over the rail. “You have the quar- 
terly Report of Redundant Reports 
to compile, to say nothing of the 
redundant reports themselves!” 

“Duty calls, Mr. Magnan,” 
Retief said soothingly. “My ad- 
ditional assignment as Wildlife 
Census Officer makes it incum- 
bent on me to cement relations with 
the locals. I’m off to a game of sky 
polo with a couple of Cabinet 
Ministers.” He waved and set spurs 
to his mount, which launched it- 
self with a bound into the wide 
green sky. END

SPORK OF THE AYOR 
{continued from page 98) 
placed it within the device’s field. 
At once it appeared to “squeeze” 
down just as I had seen life do in 
other Tepen traps. The weapon 
acted as effectively as would any 
organically generated field. 

I learned how to make the field 
large or small. When, in time, I had 
the desired knowledge, I killed the 
remaining Tepen without qualms. 

^^Tow the sun was rising above the 
valley’s rim and a cold wind 
blew through the village. Thankful 
that I could use my indirect facul- 
ties again, I teleported myself and 
the new weapon to the cavern of 
Ayorian grouping many miles away 
and five miles below ground. 
Though exhausted and badly in 
need of nourishment, I returned to 
the empty Tepen village quickly. 

I remembered how Erne had de- 
scribed the power supply surround 
ing me. She had learned that she 
could shut it down by moving 
radioactive particles away faster 
than they were produced. Though 
I couldn’t reach this low energy 
level, perhaps something similar 
might be arranged at the molecular 
level — which I could reach. 

I found a mixture of different 
elements in rodlike containers which 
furnished the main Tepen power 
source. By moving certain kinds of 
heavy chemicals from poorer to 
richer local concentrations, I in- 



creased the activity of the power 
supply. I had no knowledge of just 
how fast such an increase could take 
place. 

Fortunately I was well over 
thirty miles away from the village 
when the power supply blewl 

The Tepen were not dumb. As a 
matter of fact, they had been able 
to duplicate nearly all of the Ayor- 
ian senses by means of direct- 
action science. I appreciated the 
truly stupendous amount of prac- 
tical knowledge which they had 
gained. 

It would be possible for them to 
ignore the blowup of one village. 
Would they overlook more odd 
occurences? Not wishing to risk 
their further alarm and since my 
final plan required a full Ayorian 
grouping, I had nearly a whole 
Enithra year to wait. 

It would be dangerous to use the 
time in further harrassment of the 
Tepen, I concluded. 

But what should I do? 

^^he answer was obvious. I would 
■*“ rejoin the children. Not only 
to avoid the long period of alone- 
ness — for we Ayor do not take well 
to long periods of solitude^ but 
also to prepare for the implemen- 
tation of my plan. 

Any Ayor can always find any 
other. This is why we use objects 
for hide-and-seek, rather than our- 
sdves. How this is accomplished 
I 9o not know; but since I desired 



SPORK OF THE AYOR

to rejoin my group, I teleported 
perhaps sixty or seventy times — 
between two and three thousand 
miles — and found them. 

On my way I filled my stomach 
with berries and nuts, stopping only 
long enough between jumps to sense 
nourishment and move it to my 
stomach organ. 

The day was nearly gone, the sun 
weakening rapidly, but the children 
were still deep in one of their 
philosophical games which all Ayor- 
ian children and adults love so well. 

When I arrived, they clustered 
around me excitedly as I brought 
forth concept after concept of a 
new and novel nature. All of them 
were familiar with my twinning 
problem — not the real one which 
I had accepted at Erne’s death, 
but the assumed one which the 
grouping had called upon me. 

I didn’t attempt to argue my 
conviction regarding the Tepen. 
This would have been futile. My 
plan was far more subtle, and I was 
convinced that every Ayorian must 
be willing to accept the challenge 
as represented by Tepen or surely 
all Ayorians would one day be ex- 
tinct. 

Had they ever thought of an in- 
finite series of teleportations across 
an infinite set of points? I demon- 
strated what I meant by walking 
back and forth across the valley, so 
they could observe the character- 
istic of “continuous motion.” 

Had they observed the relation- 



ship between twinning structure 
and language structure? I demon- 
strated the concreteness of the 
Tepen language versus the abstrac- 
tion of the Ayorian language. 

Had they considered the requi- 
site characteristics of tools required 
for direct” action on material 
things as opposed to “indirect” men- 
tal action? I demonstrated by using 
my body — fingers, hands, arms 
and legs — in new and novel ways, 
then moved on to the construction 
of crude implements. Sticks used 
for shovels, levers and other devices 
of this nature captured their atten- 
tion for weeks before I could direct 
their attention to more sophisti- 
cated Tepen machinery. 

Needless to say, Spork, the Ayor- 
ian moron, kept their attention for 
the year of wait. Though Spork was 
still far inferior in mass-sensing and 
teleportation, he was proving to be 
superior in philosophical construct! 

This latter, as all Ayorians knew, 
was far the most important. With- 
out it, how could individuals twin 
or the Ayorian race advance? 

One member of our children’s 
group reached beyond his immature 
plateau level. He matured nearly 
to the point of twinning and thus 
left us for adult company. The ex- 
citement of this event caused all 
to press me even harder for novel 
philsophical ideas. I saved my best 
and biggest idea for the time of 
grouping, however. This idea con- 
sisted of two parts. 



152 



IF 




^^Can intelligent beings exist 
which do not twin?” 

And: 

“What happens to a race when 
they refuse to accept their twin- 
ning problem?” 

VI 

'^he time of grouping came again. 

I waited silently in our huge 
grouping cavern, letting my mind 
wander back over the memory of 
my years, back to Erne’s careful 
telekinetic caressing of my small 
body when I so needed comfort and 
attention. As the Ayor formed their 
grouping chain overhead I imag- 
ined I could once again sense Erne 
in her appropriate polarity position 
for this year. 

I imagined that I could sense her 
attention on me, supplying me with 
air and food and water as my needs 
became apparent. I imagined, too, 
that I once again could feel her 
love for me and her hidden puzzle- 
ment, always present, as to the pur- 
pose of her twinning problem — 
namely me, Spork the Ayorian 
moron. 

I imagined I could answer her. 

I said, “7 now know the 
purpose of your twinning problem. 
Bear with me through this next 
great trial and you, too, shall 
know. Then you will be free to 
complete your twinning!” 

When the cavern was filled with 
all the Ayor, lined up according to 



their respective philosophical pol- 
arities, and their grouping inter- 
changes had begun, I turned on the 
Tepen field from the captured Tep- 
en weapon. It filled the whole cav- 
ern to contain all the Ayor. 

Slowly I turned the dial to 
squeeze the field down. Slowly the 
whole Ayorian race was squeezed 
tighter and tighter with no way of 
escape. 

“It is the Tepen!” they shouted 
as one, in near hysteria. 

“No!” I shouted back. “It is 
Spork, the Ayorian moron!” 

“What are you doing, Spork? 
Why are you doing this?” they 
chorused. 

“I, Spork, was given my twin- 
ning problem last year at the group- 
ing. I have come to solve it!” 

Their puzzlement was clearly evi- 
dent. I let them think on it while 
I twisted the field down tighter. 

“We are not Tepen! Why do you 
treat us like this?” they cried to- 
gether. 

“I am presenting the Ayor with 
a racial twinning problem!” I re- 
sponded enigmatically. 

Then, no matter what they asked, 
I kept silent. I knew the Ayorian 
mind as I knew my own. My seeds 
had been planted — now, as well as 
earlier with the children! 

D ays passed as I squeezed the 
field down always tighter. Each 
squeeze caused the Ayor more 
anguish. But each squeeze had the 



SPORK OF THE AYOR

(Jesired effect. By now they were 
forgetting the insignificant philoso- 
phical points which formerly took 
so much of their energy and time. 
Every member was called on by the 
racial mind of the Ayor to contri- 
bute every bit of itself toward a 
solution to this dilemma. 

Weeks passed in silence ... to be 
broken finally by the suffering 
Ayor. “We understand! We accept 
our racial twinning problem.” 

And I released the field! 

The seeds I had planted in the 
children’s mind during the past year 
had slowly worked their way to the 
attention of the Ayorian conscious- 
ness. “What happens to a race,” I 
had asked the children just before 
the grouping, “when they refuse to 
accept their twinning problem? Can 
intelligent beings exist which do not 
twin?” 

Faced with direct threat to sur- 
vival of the whole race, the Ayors 
now recognized that Tepen were, 
and had been for many generations, 
their chief twinning problem. They 
now knew how they had refused to 
accept the problem — ^how stagnated 
at one plateau of development each 
of the groupings had become. 

They knew what I had done to 
them with Tepen equipment would 
eventually have been done to them 
by Tepen. Then the Ayorian race 
would die or be enslaved! 

With individual Ayorians, once 
the twinning problem is accepted, 
one accepts full responsibility for 



its resolution. It is the same with 
the race. The Ayor, having seen 
their error, fully accepted the prob- 
lem of evil Tepen as their racial 
twinning problem. With one hun- 
dred thousand Ayorians now giving 
it their primary attention, I felt no 
obstacle could prevent us from 
quickly overcoming the Tepen. 

I was close to being very wrong I 
Never once had the Tepen been 
endangered by any form of life on 
Enithra. They would feel secure. 
They would puzzle over the disap- 
pearance of one remote village, but 
they would have no cause for sus- 
picion, or need for Ayorian traps, 
within their own communities. It 
was safe, therefore, for the Ayor to 
scout out the location of each Tep- 
en on the planet. 

The day of attack arrived. Each 
Ayorian was assigned to the de- 
struction of at least one Tepen and 
surveillance of another Ayorian to 
give assistance in event of trouble. 

At a prearranged time, each Ayor 
telekmassed his assigned Tepen 
several thousand feet underground. 
The sudden appearance of Tepen 
atoms within the matrix of 
underground materials caused a 
spontaneous realignment of energy 
patterns . resulting in huge atom- 
ic explosions imderground, effect- 
ively destroying each Tepen. 

D egraded, selfish, bestial enti- 
ties that they were, yet still 
they had keen brains. The Tepen

IF 




leader had prepared equipment for 
his self-protection even in the re- 
mote possibility of an Ayorian up- 
rising, Such a contingency was so 
logically remote and unnecessary 
that it demonstrates the degree of 
paranoia which must have accom- 
panied Tepen leadership! 

As each Ayorian accomplished 
his single act of destruction against 
his assigned Tepen, he also ob- 
served the success or failure of an- 
other. Athie, assigned to the Tepen 
leader who was located in his more 
than adequately protected citadel, 
was trapped by the Tepen first. 
His mental probes activated the 
protective devices. 

The Ayorian observing ^fWe 
turned to help — and was trapped 
next. As each Ayorian mentally 
flew to help another, his own men- 
tal probes entrapped himself, as 
Ovef had been trapped in chase of 
the nut during our “nut game”. 

Faster and faster the Ayorians 
were caught while I, nearly a plan- 
etary diameter away, raged in frus- 
tration. 

I rushed to one group of adults 
only to watch as they disappeared 
before my light receptors. I, Sport, 
the Ayorian moron, Spork, the 
would-be avenger, had been the 
cause of this disaster! Was this 
mighty effort merely the start of 
total Ayorian extinction? 

One group of children moved me 
the planetary distance and I ar- 
rived, striking in frenzy and an- 



guish at the mound of metal which 
served to protect the Tepen leader 
and within which so many of my 
beloved Ayorian brethren were now 
trapped. 

Whatever I did had to be right! 
It also had to be done without the 
use of mass sense or teleportation 
faculties! 

I physically walked to the door- 
way of the metal mound, stepping: 
cautiously inside. There, in the 
center of the huge dome, was the 
suited figme of the last remaining 
Tepen. He floated over a circular 
platform surrounded by my en- 
tr£^»ped brethren. Though the tele- 
kinetic cages had only begun to be 
filled with Ayors, each was squeez- 
ed tightly against another and more 
entered in the brief moment of my 
glance. 

Enraged at these evil doings, T 
ran swiftly toward the platform in- 
tent, on grasping and killing the 
terrible Tepen leader with my 
bands and teeth. Never before — 
not since the time of Erne’s death, 
at least — had I had to control 
such terrible pent-up emotions. 

I ^rang forward — and it wa^ 
then I hit the new physical-barrier 
energy field to be knocked uncon 
sdous by my own momentum! 

VII 

W hen I regained awareness, all 
was as before — except that 
now there were twenty or more en- 



SPORK OF THE AYOR

ergy cages containing the suffering 
Ayor. Whatever threat I might 
have represented to the Tepen 
chief he must have felt was suc- 
cessfully countered by the new, in- 
visible physical-barrier shield which 
I had struck. The Tepen leader ig- 
nored me. 

I regained my feet to batter in 
futile rage at the invisible shield. 
Around and around the platform 
and cages I raced, battering and 
bruising only my fists against the 
impregnable barrier; while, just be- 
yond my reach, new energy cages 
sprang into being. 

Helplessly, I sat exhausted then, 
to stare at the polycyclic energy 
fields encaging my tribe. As each 
cycle passed from infra-red to ul- 
tra-violet, I could momentarily see 
their agonized bodies. 

Then, thank the great one, I 
knew the final answer I 

I teleported myself toward the 
evil Tepen — only to find myself, 
as expected, trapped in <Hie of the 
energy cages with the Ayor. Ah, 
but I could move through the en- 
ergy cages with my appendages — 
arms and legs I As I ^d learned 
so long ago, the magnetic structure 
of my being was too weak to be 
held by the field as my brethren 
were. I immediately pushed my 
way through the limbless Ayorian 
bodies, and easily pushed myself 
through the tingling, brilliant tele- 
kinetic entrapping field to land on 
the floor beside the Tepen chief. 



Only then did he take cognizance 
of me. 

He raised his death ray toward 
me. But I had long ago learned 
how swiftly I could move com- 
pared to them. I dodged his mo- 
tion easily, swung to his side and 
crushed my fist completely through 
the top of his thin artificial, me- 
tallic shell. My hand withdrew, 
dripping his sickly yellow fluids on- 
to the “off” switches of the tele- 
kinetic cages. 

How filled with joy we were with 
the release of nearly half our tribe I 
Now the evil Tepen were dead — 
and not one Ayorian had died in 
the accomplishment. 

The last citadel of the Tepen was 
largest of all; it contained every 
device invented or in use by the 
Tepen. Though we destroyed all 
other villages, we left the power 
plant operational in this largest 
one so that its metallic structures 
would be protected from the seek- 
ing fingers of Enithra life. 

As a racial group, the Ayor had 
reached and passed a major twin- 
ning plateau, I was sure. Hereto- 
fore, the Ayor, who were the dom- 
inant species of Enithra, excepting 
their degenerate descendants, had 
interest and concern for only things 
mental. So long as they persisted 
in this direction,, they came closer 
and closer to their racial extinc- 
tion. Thus a plateau had been 
reached, unknowingly, many gener- 
ations back. 



156 



IF 




Unwilling to challenge their bas- 
ic hypothesis of life, their relation- 
ship to it and their tribal goals, 
they maintained their plateau po- 
sition unchanged. They had dis- 
guised their lack of evolutionary 
progress in their terrible drive for 
“consistency.” 

Even their philosophical games, 
as I had learned under the chil- 
dren, bore the marks of this rigid- 
ity. Only those ideas which were 
both novel and simultaneously con- 
sistent with their past philosophy 
could win in the game. 

Over the years, truly new and 
novel ideas that were inconsistent 
with past philosophy were unaccep- 
table. Thus the rise of the Tepen 
was inevitable as some kind of di- 
vergent radial adaptation. 

Fortunately for the Ayor, I, too, 
was inconsistent to the Enithra way 
of life — not just to Ayor or Tep- 
en, but to all plant life and animal 
life. 

I was capable of indirect and di- 
rect action against the material en- 
vironment. Thus, as the central 
part of Eme^s twinning problem, 
she had to recognize and accept my 
inconsistency from Enithra pat- 
terns. If my beloved Erne had only 
lived, I like to believe that her 
eventual recognition and accept- 
ance would have led her genetic 
children to accept the principle of 
direct action along with their na- 
tive-born instinctive, indirect ac- 
tion. 



JT'ortunately, too, I was placed 
with the Ayorian children for 
so many years. There I thoroughly 
learned the Ayorian mind, how it 
worked, and how each individual 
twinning led to divergent radial 
adaptations through changes in the 
magnetic structure of each twin. 
For the Ayor, form followed func- 
tion almost completely. Once func- 
tion — that is, accepted premises 
of one’s attitude toward the uni- 
verse — changed, then so did their 
structure and their potential. 

Only the children were sufficient- 
ly plastic to accept my ideas as 
worthy of consideration — even 
though not consistent with past 
Ayorian belief. 

Then, too, only the terrible Tep- 
en threat to Ayorian survival could 
force the Ayorian adult to re-struct- 
ure his thinking. 

I could easily imagine the next 
plateau for the Ayorians ! First, 
tentatively exploring and stum- 
bling time and again, the Ayor 
would reach for the knowledge of 
the Tepen. Slowly but surely, they 
would enlarge the fabric of their 
being to include the principles of 
both direct and indirect action 
against their environment. Then, 
and only then, they would become 
true masters of their environment 
— ready, perhaps, for the next 
plateau. 

But why do I speak of ^^them” 
so easily? Am I not, too, an Ayor- 
ian? 



SPORK OF THE AYOR 



157 




If I were truly an Ayor, one 
who has accepted fully another’s 
twinning problem and conquered it 
successfully as I had Erne’s, would 
I not twin? Yet here am I, Spork 
the moron, Spork the avenger, un- 
twinned. 

Release of tension which often 
accompanies death and its dangers 
brought me to a new low of emo- 
tional apathy. I could not under- 
stand my failure to twin, as would 
any other Ayor who had conquered 
a twinning problem. 

So in puzzlement and emotional 
apathy, I turned my back on my 
brothers. I teleported at random, 
from point to point, across Eni- 
thra’s surface. The sun shone 
brightly whenever I passed through 
cloudless skies; the flowers still 
displayed variegated rivers of col- 
orful motion; animal life jumped 
and struggled around me. Yet I 
passed through Enithra’s delights 
with my mind slowed and my spir- 
its sagging. 7 hadrCt twined! Who 
am I? What am 1? 

The place was profusely cov- 
ered with dense violet jungle 
growth — it was the place where 
Erne had found me twelve Enithra 
years ago. Oddly, I had not given 
thought to this place during all my 
years of growth. 

Nearly all of the metal I had 
been found in was gone. Plant life 
had found it an easy source for 
nourishment from which, molecule 
by molecule, it was drawn. 



My hand touched the polariza- 
tion barrier surrounding the un- 
touched dense metal ball within 
which Erne had found me. 

Inscribed on some chemical 
structure still unwanted by Eni- 
thra life was the regular geometric 
inscription that Erne had described 
to me and puzzled over for so many 
years. It was shaped thus: 

HEART 

OF THE HOUSE 
OF THE GALACTIC COUNCIL. 

Beyond this strange geometry 
was the dense sphere. Inside it lay 
only broken pieces of apparatus 
discarded or not yet used by the 
voracious appetite of Enithra’s life. 
Clearly, there was no hint here 
as to what Spork really was I 

In much sadness and sentimen- 
talism, I sat to stare at this odd 
figure. My mind searched all 
around to recapture the original 
scene. Where had Erne hidden? 
What did she hide behind? Was 
she in the small hollow cave only 
three miles away? Was she behind 
that flowing waterfall only a mile 
away? 

With strangely watering light- 
receptors, I let my mind reach 
through its forty-mile limit to find 
what would have appeared to Erne 
to be a good hiding place from 
Tepen. Then I imagined Erne 
there, slowly letting her fine-tuned 
telekmass sensor reach out for 



158 



IF 




study of the once hot body at my 

feet. 

As I imagined her mind pushing 
from atom to atom, always alert 
for Tepen traps, I let my mind 
wander over the small life form 
which was I, inside the protective 
sphere; I imagined how I must 
have lain so still to be fed by 
strange mechanical and chemi- 
cal apparatus. 

As my mind dwelled sentimen- 
tally on the total experience, I 
imagined I could once again feel 
the touch of soft hands pressing 
and caressing my baby skin. 
“Much like Erne’s telekinetic 
touch,” I thought. 

'^hen, still in deep fatigue and 
^ reverie, fragments of my mem- 
ory coalesced to break open with 
blinding reality. 

I really was being held! I could 
feel her hands on my back and her 
breast at my chest! I could smell 
her clean perfume! I knew the se- 
curity of deep contentment that 
comes only with a full stomach and 
a biological mother’s love! 

She patted me on my buttocks 
while the other being spoke: 
“Though we headed the house of 
the galactic council, Patricia, the 
sabotage was inevitable. We may 
be genetically superior. But to the 
common people we are still only 



human. Place the baby in the life 
container now.” 

I, Spork, the Ayorian moron — 
Spork, the avenger — was Spork, 
“only human!” 

Aside from new conscious mem- 
ory of my parent’s similarity to my 
structure — with arms, legs, nose, 
mouth and so on — their conver- 
sation was as meaningless to me as 
was the geometry proclaiming 
“HEART OF THE HOUSE OF 
THE GALACTIC COUNCIL.” 

Though I now knew I belonged 
to another species, the knowledge 
was only that, not an emotional 
fact of my life. And the noises 
which my parents used just before 
placing me in the life container 
were “feeling” messages, not se- 
mantic symbols terminating in con- 
scious understanding. I still had to 
discern meaning. “Only human” 
was just a part of the buried se- 
mantic content in need of deciph- 
ering. 

I slept a dreamless sleep, deep 
with comfort and contentment this 
night The weather was mild and 
the sleep fulfilling; my mind, fin- 
ally composing itself in nature’s 
way, also prepared me for the long 
future ahead. 

I slept in peace. Perhaps I could 
not twin, but I had been given a 
new twinning problem: to find the 
content for the symbol “human” — 
and to attain my destinyl END

CRY 1 



Dear Editor: 

Since President Nixon has recent- 
ly gone on record as opposing ap- 
propriations for deep-space explor- 
ation, there are good grounds for 
your concern that our race will elect 
to delay its full entrance into space 
and return to its “wars and squab- 
bles”. If the squabbling is carried 
out in the usual fashion, this clear- 
ly involves a net loss. But the 
closed-system approach to inhabited 
planets has spawned an odd and 
somewhat frightening conjecture 
which might be used to defend Mr. 
Nixon’s position. 

The conjecture (I believe it was 
made by Fred Hoyle) is that any 
intelligent race on the verge of be- 
coming spacefarers is apt to be 
threatened at exactly that time with 
a period of extreme social instabil- 
ity — a mechanism ideal for reduc- 
ing interstellar congestion. 

The argument for this is fairly 
simple. A race which is just 
reaching the technological level need- 
ed for space travel is starting to 
crowd the limits of its planet in sev- 
eral important ways. Its civilization’s 



normal functioning is starting to get 
rough on global ecology (and other 
environmental features). Its technol- 
ogy can raise comprehensive hell in 
the (formerly tolerable) event of ma- 
jor war. And it is being pressured to- 
ward these hazards by the simple 
force of population pressure. 

In one sense there shouldn’t be 
any problem. The ecological damage 
could be cut down, the social tem- 
pers soothed and the population 
quickly decrowded — all by some 
simple applications of fast, high- 
volume space travel to lots of well 
scouted habitable planets. The effic- 
acy of this “frontier” solution could 
be argued by analogy with the salu- 
tary effects that the opening up of 
the Western Hemisphere had on our 
own “old world”. But there will not 
be enough time for this solution 
to develop. Before the race can de- 
velop and carry out interstellar ex- 
ploration, it will have (at least 
temporarily) taken itself out of the 
running . unless it can develop 
other means of getting itself through 
the social bottleneck. 

If this conjecture is at all cor- 



160 





rect^ the races who inherit the stars 
will be, paradoxically, not those 
which devote their energies to space 
travel as soon as it comes within 
their reach, but those which divert 
their energies to fairly successful 
dealings with their wars and squab- 
blesl 

I would be interested in hearing 
other people’s reactions to this idea. 

1 do not apologize if the above 
sounds neo-Malthusian. I cannot agree 
with Mr. Gold’s listing of Malthus 
among the “great refuted theorists” 
of the past, particularly in view of 
the fact that Argentina, Australia 
and the U.S. — the only nations 
now producing more food than they 
can eat — were all pure frontier to 
his world. — Wilbur Walkoe, Jr., 
4505 Lake Michigan Drive, Allen- 
dale, Michigan 49401. 

# Very good points, to be sure. But 
whether they can be used to demon- 
strate the space program should 
be canceled is another question. We 
think not. First, because a solution 
which may not work should not be 
abandoned on those grounds unless 
there are alternative solutions which 
are both more likely to work and 
competitive with the uncertain one. 
We have no such alternative solu- 
tions. Second, because there is no 
clearly visible future time which will 
be better for implementing a space 



program than now, so why not do it 
now? (Especially since if popula- 
tion gro?^ remains explosive, iEill 
future times are likely to have less 
in the wsqt of available capital than 
the present.) Third — and probably 
most important! — Because Space Is 
There. The Editor,
