TV BY THE NUMBERS 



M urray Leinster was in the of- 
fice the other day to talk about 
stories. So we talked about them 
(and hope to be bringing you some 
of the results of the talk shortly) ; 
after which the conversation turned 
to the business which had brought 
Leinster to New York. He had been 
talking patent releases with a large 
corporation. The patent was his 
own. It seems that some years ago 
one of Leinster^s stories was being 
adapted for a television program 
and, visiting on the lot, Leinster 
noticed an awful lot of activity go- 
ing on in putting up and breaking 
down sets. Turned out, that studio 
alone was spending an amount in 
five figures every week — not to 
build new sets, but just to truck 
old ones back and forth between the 
warehouse and the studio as needed. 

That struck Leinster as rather a 
waste. It was just background, after 
all. If you photographed it once, it 
should stay photographed. ... So 
he went home and designed an op- 
tical system to make it possible to 
retain the backgrounds without all 
the bother of having them physically 
present all the time . and the 
royalties from that are one reason 
why you don^t see as many Leinster 
stories as you used to any more. 

Which started your editor think- 
ing. 



P hotographing sets once instead 
of a hundred times js a fine 
saving, no doubt. But look. You 
don^t really want the sets at all in 
the long run, do you? All you want 
is an image of the sets. 

For that matter, you donT really 
want props — or actors. 

Maybe you don’t even need cam- 
eras. 

In order to give your television 
audience an hour’s amusement (or 
addicted boredom, which is more 
like it) , you only need to make 
sure that a finite number of phos- 
phor spots on the inside of a cath- 
ods tube sparkle in the proper or- 
der. That’s all that goes on now, 
of course. It happens that the elec- 
tron gun that makes the phosphors 
sparkle is programmed by a video 
camera, which in turn is program- 
med by scanning live actors on a 
live set. But still. 

Each point of light on the TV 
tube is still just a point of light. 
It’s either on or off. That’s all. (Not 
counting color television, where the 
signal in the set specifies “chromin- 
ance” as well as “luminance” — but 
let’s not bother about color for a 
moment.) 

There are about 420 active phos- 
phor spots on each line of an Amer- 
ican tube. You could write that line 
as a binary number. Let “1” be on;

let ^^0” be off. A string- of 420 l^s 
would mean every one of those spots 
would be on. A binary number like 
1001 ... 00 would mean the first 
spot is on, the second off, the third 
off, the fourth on ... up to the last 
two being off. (Write the missing 
414 digits to please yourself — we 
don't have room!) 

That takes care of one line ; there 
are 525 lines to a frame. Well, write 
each line separately. It takes 220,000 
binary digits to describe the whole 
picture — but it is still just a num- 
ber. And yet that number can repre- 
sent anything a television screen can 
show, from Chet Huntley announc- 
ing the end of the world to Lassie 
preventing it from happening. 
That's all a television picture is, 
you see; a binary number. 

The only thing wrong with the 
picture is that it's a snapshot. It 
doesn't move. 

But that's easily enough solved. 
Erase the picture — actually, you 
don't have to; the decay time of the 
phosphor is carefully planned so that 
it will erase itself as necessary. 
Write a new one. Write thirty new 
ones and run them one after an- 
other, and you have a full second of 
actual animated activity on the tube 
— total size of the numbers you 
have written, now Just short of 
seven million bits. 

From there on its just multiplica- 
tion. A 25 billion digit number gives 
you an hour show. 600 billion digits 
gives you twenty-four hours of pro- 
gramming, or more than you get 
on any but a few eccentric stations 
in the world each day. 

Of course, you may want it in 



color, which adds a problem. How 
much of a problem depends on what 
system of color television you are 
using and how you elect to encode 
it; but you could do it by simply 
tripling the number of digits. 

You stiy only have to write one 
unique number each day, and out 
of it comes the morning news, the 
housewives' exercise hour, the quiz 
shows, the sports events, the comics 
and the singers, the panel shows 
and the documentaries ... and 
all the little commercials as well. 
Nothing hard about writing one 
number a day, is there? Even if 
the number chances to be slightly 
less than two trillion digits long? 

A ctually it might not be as hard 
as you think. Between the 220, 
000 digits in any given frame and 
the 220,000 digits in the one that 
follows it a thirtieth of a second 
later, there isn't really a great deal 
of change — and what change there 
is is reasonably systematic. I.e., can 
be programmed into a computer. 
And think what you'd save! Produc- 
tion costs on a single TV hour can 
run half a million dollars. Each of 
those little one-minute commercials 
can cost tens of thousands — and 
go on costing thousands in residuals, 
every time they're used. But your 
computer-generated binary number 
wouldn't expect residuals. Comput- 
ers rarely if ever belong to AFTRA. 

Anyway, there it is. NBC, ABC, 
CBS, BBC and others — take no- 
tice. And when you get around to 
sending royalty checks, please make 
them out to —

NEUTRON STAR 

by LARRY NIVEN 

Illustrated by ADKINS 



If was the kind of star so tiny 
but massive that it trapped even 
light. Now it trapped even me! 



I 

T he Skydiver dropped out of 
hyperspace an even million 
miles above the neutron star. I 
needed' a minute to place my- 
self against the stellar background 
and another to find the distortion 
Sonya Laskin had mentioned before 
she died. It was to my left, an area 
the apparent size of the Earth’s 
moon. I swung the ship around to 
face it. 

Curdled stars, muddled stars, 
stars that had been stirred with a 
spoon. 



The neutron star was in the cen- 
ter, of course, though I couldn’t see 
it and hadn’t expected to. It was 
only eleven miles across, and cool. 
A billion years had passed since 
BVS-1 burned by fusion fire. Mil- 
lions of years, at least, since the 
cataclysmic two weeks during which 
BVS-1 was an X-ray star, burning 
at a temperature of five billion de- 
grees Kelvin. Now it showed only 
by its mass. 

The ship began to turn by it- 
self. I felt the pressure of the fusion 
drive. Without help from me, my 
faithful metal watchdog was putting 



7 




me in hyjperbolic orbit that would 
take me Within one mile of the neu- 
tron star’s surface. Twenty-four 
hours to fall, twenty-four hours to 
rise . and during that time, some- 
thing would try to kill me. As some- 
thing had killed the Laskins. 

The same type of autopilot, with 
the same program, had chosen the 
Laskins’ orbit. It had not caused 
their ship to collide with the star. 
I could trust the autopilot. I could 
even change its program. 

I really ought to. 

How did I get myself into this 
hole? 

The drive went off after ten min- 
utes of maneuvering. My orbit was 
established, in more , ways than one. 
I knew what would happen if I tried 
to back out now. 

All I’d done was walk into a drug- 
store to get a new battery for my 
lighter! 

R ight in the middle of the store, 
surrounded by three floors of 
sales counters, was the new 2603 
Sinclair intrasystem yacht. I’d come 
for a battery, but I stayed to admire. 
It was a beautiful job, small and 
sleek and streamlined and blatantly 
different from anything that’s ever 
been built. I wouldn’t have flown 
it for anything, but I had to admit 
it was pretty. I ducked my head 
through the door to look at the 
control panel. You never saw so 
many dials. When I pulled my head 
out, all the customers were looking 
in the same direction. The place had 
gone startlingly quiet. 

I can’t blame them for staring. A 
numiber of aliens were in the store. 



mainly shopping for souvenirs, but 
they were staring too. A puppeteer 
is unique. Imagine a headless, three- 
legged centaur wearing two Cecil the 
Seasick Sea Serpent puppets on his 
arms, and you’ll have something like 
the right picture. But the arms are 
weaving necks, and the puppets are 
real heads, flat and brainless, with 
wide flexible lips. The brain is un- 
der a bony hump set between the 
bases of the necks. This puppeteer 
wore only its own coat of brown 
hair, with a mane that extended all 
the way up its spine to form a thick 
mat over the brain. I’m told that the 
way they wear the mane indicates 
their status in society, but to me it 
could have been anything from a 
dock worker to a jeweler to the presi- 
dent of General Products. 

I watched with the rest as it 
came across the floor, not because 
I’d never seen a puppeteer, but 
because there is something beautiful 
about the dainty way they move on 
those slender legs and tiny hooves. 
I watched it come straight toward 
me, closer and closer. It stopped a 
foot away, looked me over and said, 
“You are Beowulf Shaeffer, former 
chief pilot for Nakamura Lines.” 

Its voice was a beautiful contralto 
with not a trace of accent. A pup- 
peteer’s mouths are not only the 
most flexible speech organs around, 
but also the most sensitive hands. 
The tongues are forked and point- 
ed, the wide, thick lips have little 
fingerlike knobs along the rims. Im- 
agine a watchmaker with a sense of 
taste in his fingertips . 

I cleared my throat. “That’s right.” 

It consider^ me from two direc-

IF 




tions. “You would be interested in 
a high-paying job?” 

“I’d be fascinated in a high-paying 
job.” 

“I am our equivalent of the region- 
al president of General Products. 
Please come with me, and we will 
discuss this elsewhere.” 

1 followed it into a displacement 
'booth. Eyes followed me all the 
way. It was embarrassing, being ac- 
costed in a public drugstore by a 
two-headed monster. Maybe the pup- 
peteer knew it. Maybe it was testing 
me to see how badly I needed money. 

My need was great. Eight months 
had passed since Nakamura Lines 
folded. For some time before that, 
I had been living very high on the 
hog, knowing that my back pay 
would cover by debts. I never saw 
that back pay. It was quite a crash, 
Nakamura Lines. Respectable mid- 
dle-aged businessmen took to leaving 
their hotel windows without their lift 
belts. Me, I kept spending. If I’d 
started living frugally, my creditors 
would have done some checking . 
and I’d have ended in debtor’s prison. 

The pupp>eteer dialed thirteen fast 
digits with its tongue. A moment 
later we .were elsewhere. Air puffed 
out when I opened the booth door, 
and I swallowed to pop my ears. 

“We are on the roof of the Gen- 
eral Products building.” The rich 
contralto voice thrilled along my 
nerves, and I had to remind myself 
that it was an alien speaking, not 
a lovely woman. “You must examine 
this spacecraft while we discuss your 
assignment.” 

I stepped outside a little cautious- 



ly, but it wasn’t the windy season. 
The roof was at ground level. That’s 
the way we build on We Made It. 
Maybe it has something to do 
with the fifteen-hundred-mile-an- 
hour winds we get in summer and 
winter, when the planet’s axis of ro- 
tation runs through its primary, 
Procyon. The winds are our planet’s 
only tourist attraction; and it would 
be a shame to slow them down by 
planting skyscrapers in their path. 
The bare, square concrete roof was 
surrounded by endless square miles 
of desert, not like the deserts of 
other inhabited worlds, but an ut- 
terly lifeless expanse of fine sand 
just crying to be planted with orna- 
mental cactus. We’ve tried that. The 
wind blows the plants away. 

The ship lay on the sand beyond 
the roof. It was a #2 General Pro- 
ducts hull: a cylinder three hundred 
feet long and twenty feet through, 
pointed at both ends and with a 
slight wasp-waist constriction near 
the tail. For some reason it was 
lying on its side, with the landing 
shocks still folded in at the tail. 

Ever notice how all ships have 
begun to look the same? A good 
ninety-five percent of today’s space- 
crafts are built around one of the 
four General Products hulls. It’s 
easier and safer to build that way, 
but somehow all ships end as they 
began: mass-produced look-alikes. 

The hulls are delivered fully 
transparent, and you use paint where 
you feel like it. Most of this par- 
ticular hull had been left transpar- 
ent. Only the nose had been painted, 
around the lifesystem. There was no 
major reaction drive. A series of 



NEUTRON STAR

retractable attitude jets had been 
mounted in the sides, and the hull 
was pierced with smaller holes, 
square and round — for observation- 
al instruments. I could see them 
gleaming through the hull. 

T he puppeteer was moving" toward 
the nose, but something made 
me turn toward the stern for a 
closer look at the landing shocks. 

They were bent. Behind the 
curved, transparent hull panels, some 
tremendous pressure had forced the 
metal to flow like warm wax, back 
and into the pointed stern. 

“What did this?” I asked. 

“We do not know. We wish stren- 
uously to find out.” 

“W^at do you mean?” 

“Have you heard of the neutrbn 
star BVS-1?” 

I had to think a moment. “First 
neutron star ever found, and so far 
the only. Someone located it two 
years ago by stellar displacement.” 
“BVS-1 was found by the Institute 
of Knowledge on Jinx. We learned 
through a go-between that the In- 
stitute wished to explore the star. 
They needed a ship to do it. They 
had not yet sufficient money. We 
offered to supply them with a ship’s 
hull, with the usual guarantees, if 
they would turn over to us all data 
they acquired through using our 
ship.” 

“Sounds fair enough.” I didn’t 
ask why they hadn’t done their 
own exploring. Like most sentient 
vegetarians, puppeteers find descre- 
tion to be the only part of valor. 

‘Two humans named Peter Lask- 
in and Sonya Laskin wished to use 



the ship. They intended to oome 
within one mile of the surface in a 
hyperbolic orbit. At some point dur- 
ing their trip, an unknown force ap- 
parently reached through the hull 
to do this to the landing shocks. 
The unknown force also seems to 
have killed the pilots.” 

“But that’s impossible. Isn’t it?” 

“You see the pK)int. Come with 
me.” The puppeteer trotted toward 
the bow. 

I saw the point, all right. Nothing, 
but nothing can get through a Gen- 
eral Products hull. No kind of elec- 
tromagnetic energy except 'visible 
light. No kind of matter, from the 
smallest subatomic particle to the 
fastest meteor. That’s what the com- 
pany’s advertisements claim, and the 
guarantee backs theni up. I’ve never 
doubted it, and I’ve never heard 
of a General Products hull being 
damaged by a weapon or by anything 
else. 

On the other hand, a General 
Products hull is as ugly as it is func- 
tional. The puppeteer-owned com- 
pany could be badly hurt if it got 
around that something could get 
through a company hull. But I didn’t 
see where I came in. 

We rode an escalladder into the 
nose. 

The lifesystem was in two com- 
partments/ Here the Laskins had 
used heat-reflective paint. In the con- 
ical control cabin the hull had been 
divided into windows. The relaxa- 
tion room behind it was a window- 
less reflective silver. .From the back 
wall of the relaxation room an access 
tube ran aft, opening on various in- 
struments and the hyperdrive motors. 



There were two acceleration 
couches in the control cabin. Both 
had been torn loose from their 
mountings and wadded into the nose 
like so much tissue paper, crushing 
the instrument panel. The backs of 
the crumpled couches were splashed 
with rust brown. Flecks of the same 
color were all over everything, the 
walls, the windows, the viewscreens. 
It was as if something had hit the 
couches from behind: something like 
a dozen paint-filled toy balloons, 
striking with tremendous force. 

“That’s blood,” I said. 

“That is correct. Human circula- 
tory fluid.”

wenty-four hours to fall. 

I spent most of the first twelve 
hours in the relaxation room, trying 
to read. Nothing significant was 
happening, except that a few times 
I saw the phenomenon Sonya Laskin 
had mentioned in her last report. 
When a star went directly behind the 
invisible BVS-1, a halo formed. BVS- 
1 was heavy enough to bend light 
around it, displacing most stars to 
the sides; but when a star went di- 
rectly behind the neutron star, its 
light was displaced to all sides at 
once. Result: a tiny circle which 
flashed once and was gone almost 
before the eye could catch it. 

I’d known next to nothing about 
neutron stars the day the puppeteer 
picked me up. Now I was an expert. 
But I still had no idea what was 
waiting for me when I got down 
there. 

All the matter you’re ever likely

to meet will be normal matter, com- 
posed of a nucleus of protons and 
neuitrons sunrounded by electrons in 
quantum energy states. In the heart 
of any star there is a second kind 
of matter: for there, the tremendous 
pressure is enough to smash the elec- 
tron shells. The result is degenerate 
matter: nuclei forced together by 
pressure and gravity, but held apart 
by the mutual repulsion of the more 
or less continuous electron ‘gas’ 
around them. The right circum- 
stances may create a third type of 
matter. 

Given: a burnt-out white dwarf 
with a mass greater than 1.44 times 
the mass of the Sun — Chandrasek- 
har’s Limit, named for an Indian- 
American astronomer of the nine- 
teen hundreds. In such a mass the 
electron pressure alone would not 
be able to hold the electrons back 
from the nuclei. Electrons would be 
forced against protons — to make 
neutrons. In one blazing explosion 
most of the star would change from 
a compressed mass of degenerate 
matter to a closely packed lump of 
neutrons: neutronium, theoretically 
the densest matter possible in this 
universe. Most of the remaining 
normal and degenerate matter would 
be blown away by the liberated heat. 

For two weeks the star would give 
off X rays, as its core temperature 
dropped from five billion degrees 
Kelvin to five hundred million. After 
that it would be a light-emitting 
body perhaps ten to twelve miles 
across: the next best thiqg to in- 
visible. It was not strange that BVS- 
1 was the first neutron star ever 
found. 



Neither is it strange that the In- 
stitute of Knowledge on Jinx would 
have spent a good deal of time and 
trouble looking. Until BVS-1 was 
found, neutronium and neutron stars 
were only theories. The examina- 
tion of an actual neutron star could 
be of tremendous importance. Neu- 
tron stars could give us the key to 
true gravity control. 

Mass of BVS-1: 1.3 times the 
mass of Sol, approximately. 

Diameter of BVS-1 (estimated): 
eleven miles of neutronium, covered 
by half a mile of degenerate matter, 
covered by maybe twelve feet of or- 
dinary matter. 

Escape velocity: 130,000 mps, ap- 
proximately. 

Nothing else was known of the 
tiny black star until the Laskins went 
in to look. Now the Institute knew 
one thing more. The star’s spin. 

44 4 mass that large can distort 
space by its rotation,” said 
the puppeteer. “The Institute ship’s 
projected hyperbola was twisted 
across itself in such a way that we 
can deduce the star’s period of ro- 
tation to be two minutes, twenty- 
seven seconds.** 

The bar was somewhere in the 
General Products building. I don’t 
know just where, and with the trans- 
fer booths it doesn’t matter. I kept 
staring at the puppeteer bartender. 
Naturally only a puppeteer would be 
served by a puppeteer bartender, 
since any biped would resent know- 
ing that somebody made his drink 
with his mouth. I had already de- 
cided to get dinner somewhere else. 

“I see your problem,” I said.

“Your sales will suffer if it gets out 
that something can reach through 
one of your hulls and smash a crew 
to bloody smears. But where do I 
fit in?”

of Sonya Laskin and Peter Laskin. 
We must find — ” 

“With me?” 

“Yes. We must find out what it 
is that our hulls cannot stop. Na- 
tuarlly you may — ” 

“But I won’t.” 

“We are prepared to offer one 
million stars.” 

“I was tempted, but only for a 
moment. “Forget it.” 

“Naturally you will be allowed 
to build your own ship, starting with 
a #2 General Products hull.” 

“Thanks, but I’d like to go on 
living.” 

“You would dislike being confin- 
ed. I find that We Made It has re- 
established the debtor’s prison. If 
General Products made public your 
accounts . .” 

“Now, just a — ” 

“You owe money in the close or- 
der of five hundred thousand stars. 
We will pay your creditors before 
you leave. If you return — ” I had 
to admire the creature’s honesty in 
not saying when — “we will pay you 
the remainder. You may be asked 
to speak to news commentators con- 
cerning the voyage, in which case 
there will be more stars.” 

“You say I can build my own 
ship?” 

“Naturally. This is not a voyage 
of exploration. We want you to re- 
turn safely.” 

“It’s a deal,” I said. 



After all, the puppeteer had tried 
to blackmail me. What happened 
next would be its own fault. 

T hey built my ship in two weeks 
flat. They started with a #2 
General Products hull, just like the 
one around the Institute of Knowl- 
edge ship, and the lifesystem was 
practically a duplicate of the Las- 
kins’, but there the resemblance 
ended. There were no instruments to 
observe neutron stars.' Instead, there 
was a fusion motor big enough for 
a Jinx warliner. In my ship, which 
I now called Skydiver, the drive 
would produce thirty gees at the 
safety limit. There was a laser can- 
non big enough to punch a hole 
through We Made It’s moon. The 
puppeteer wanted me to feel safe, 
and now I did, for I could fight and 
I could run. Especially I could run. 

I heard the Laskins’ last broad- 
cast through half a dozen times. 
Their unnamed ship had dropped 
out of hyperspace a million miles 
above BVS-1. Gravity warp would 
have prevented their getting closer 
in hyperspace. While her husband 
was crawling through the access tube 
for an instrument check, Sonya Las- 
kin had called the Institute of Knowl- 
edge. “. we can’t see it yet, not 
with the naked eye. But we can see 
where it is. Every time some star or 
other goes behind it, there’s a little 
ring of light. Just a minute. Peter’s 
ready to use the telescope . .” 

Then the star’s mass had cut the 
hyperspacial link. It was expected, 
and nobody had worried — then. 
Later, the same effect must have 
stopped them from escaping what- 



14 



IF 




ever attacked them, into hyperspace. 
When would-be rescuers found 
the ship, only the radar and the 
cameras were still running. They 
didn’t tell us much. There had been 
no camera in the cabin. But the 
forward camera gave us, for one 
instant, a speed-blurred view of the 
neutron star. It was a featureless 
disc the orange color of perfect bar- 
becue coals, if you know someone 
who can afford to burn wood. This 
object had been a neutron star a long 
time. 

“There’ll be no need to paint the 
ship,” I told the president. 

“You should not make such a trip 
with the walls transparent. You 
would go insane.” 

“I’m no flatlander. The mind- 
wrenching sight of naked space fills 
me with mild, but waning interest. 
I want to know nothing’s sneaking 
up behind me.” 

T he day before I left, I. sat alone 
in the General Products bar 
letting the puppeteer bartender make 
me drinks with his mouth. He did 
it well. Puppeteers were scattered 
around the bar in twos and threes, 
with a couple of men for variety; 
but the 'drinking hour had not yet 
arrived. The place felt empty. 

I was pleased with myself. My 
debts were all paid, not that that 
would matter where I was going. I 
would leave with not a mini-credit 
to my name; with nothing but the 
ship . 

All told, I was well out of a sticky 
situation. I hoped I’d like being a 
rich exile. 

I jumped when the newcomer sat 



down across from me. He was a 
foreigner, a middle-aged man wear- 
ing an expensive night-black busi- 
ness suit and a snow-white asymme- 
tric beard. I let my face freeze and 
started to get up. 

“Sit down, Mr. Shaeffer.” 

“Why?” 

He told me by showing me a blue 
disc. An Earth-government ident. I 
looked it over to show I was alert, 
not because I’d know an ersatz from 
the real thing. 

“My name is Sigmund Ausfaller,” 
said the government man. “I wish 
to say a few words concerning your 
assignment on behalf of General Pro- 
ducts.” 

I nodded, not saying anything. 

“A record of your verbal contract 
was sent to us as a matter of course. 
I noticed some peculiar things about 
it. Mr. Shaeffer, will you really take 
such a risk for only five hundred 
thousand stars?” 

“I’m getting twice that.” 

“But you only keep half of it. 
The rest goes to pay debts. Then 
there are taxes. But never mind. 
What occurred to me was that a 
spaceship is a spaceship, and yours is 
very well armed and has powerful 
legs. An admirable fighting ship, if 
you were moved to sell it.” 

“But it isn’t mine.” 

“There are those who would not 
ask. On Canyon, for example, or the 
Isolationist party of Wonderland.” 

I said nothing. 

“Or, you might be planning a ca- 
reer of piracy. A risky business, pi- 
racy, and I don’t take the notion 
seriously.” 

I hadn’t even thought about pi- 



NEUTRON STAR 



15 




racy. But I’d have to give up on 
Wonderland . 

“What I would like to say is this, 
Mr. Shaeffer. A single entrepreneur, 
if he were 'sufficiently dishonest, 
could do terrible damage to the repu- 
tation of all human beings every- 
where. Most species find it neces- 
sary to police the ethics of their own 
memibers, and we are no exception. 
It occurred to me that you might 
not take your ship to the neutron 
star at all; that you would take it 
elsewhere and sell it. The puppeteers 
do not make invulnerable war ves- 
sels. They are pacifists. Your Sky- 
diver is unique. 

“Hence I have asked General Pro- 
ducts to allow me to install a remote 
control bomb in the Skydiver. Since 
it is inside the hull, the hull cannot 
protect you. I had it installed this 
afternoon. 

“Now, notice! If you have not re- 
ported within a week I will set off 
the bomb. There are several worlds 
within a week’s hyperspace flight of 
here, but all recognize the dominion 
of Earth. If you flee, you must leave 
your ship within a week, so I hardly 
think you will land on a nonhabitable 
world. Clear?” 

“Clear.” 

“If I am wrong, you may take a 
lie-detector test and prove it. Then 
you may punch me in the nose, and 
I will apologize handsomely.” 

L shook my head. He stood up, 
bowed and leh me sitting there cold 
sober. 

F our films had been taken from 
the Laskins’ cameras. In the 
time left to me, I ran through them 



several times, without seeing any- 
thing out of the way. If the ship had 
run through a gas cloud, the impact 
could have killed the Laskins. At 
perihelion they were moving at bet- 
ter than half the speed of light. But 
there would have been friction, and 
I saw no sign of heating in the 
films. If something alive had at- 
tacked them, the beast was invisible 
to radar and to an enormous range 
of light frequencies. If the attitude 
jets had fired accidentally — I was 
clutching at straws — the light show- 
ed on none of the films. 

There would be savage magnetic 
forces near BVS-1, but that couldn’t 
have done any damage. No such 
force could penetrate a General Pro- 
ducts hull. Neither could heat, ex- 
cept in special bands of radiated 
light, bands visible to at least one of 
the puppeteers’ alien customers. I 
hold adverse opinions on the Gen- 
eral Products hull, but they all con- 
cern the dull anonymity of the de- 
sign. Or maybe I resent the fact that 
General Products holds a near-mon- 
opoly on spacecraft hulls and isn’t 
owned by human beings. But if I’d 
had to trust my life to, say, the Sin- 
clair yacht I’d seen in the drugstore. 
I’d have chosen jail. 

Jail was one of my three choices. 
But I’d be there for life. Ausfaller 
would see to that. 

Or I could run for it in the Sky- 
diver. But no world within reach 
would have me, that is. Of course, 
if I could find an undiscovered 
Earthlike world within a week of 
We Made It . 

Fat chance. I prefered BVS-1 to 
that any day. 



16 



IF 




Ill 



1 thought that flashing circle of 
light was getting bigger, but it 
flashed so seldom I couldn’t be sure. 
BVS-1 wouldn’t show even in my 
telescope. I gave that up and settled 
for just waiting. 

Waiting, I remembered a long-ago 
summer I spent on Jinx. There were 
days when, unable to go outside be- 
cause a derth of clouds had spread 
the land with raw blue-white sun- 
light, we amused ourselves by filling 
party balloons with tap water and 
drppping them on the sidewalk from 
three stories up. They made lovely 
splash patterns — which dried out 
too fast. So we put a little ink in 
each balloon before fflling it. Then 
the patterns stayed. 

Sonya Laskin had been in her 
chair when the chairs collapsed. 
Blood samples showed that it was 
Peter, who had struck them from 
behind, like a water balloon dropped 
from a great height. 

What could get through a Gen- 
eral Products hull? 

Ten hours to fall. 

I unfastened the safety net and 
went for an inspection tour. The 
access tunnel was three feet wide, 
just right to push through in free 
fall. Below me was the length of 
the fusion tube; to the left, the laser 
cannon; to the right, a set of curved 
side tubes leading to inspection 
points for the gyros, the batteries 
and generator, the air plant, the 
hyperspace shunt motors. All was in 
order — except me. I was clumsy. 
My jumps were always too short or 
too long. There was no room to turn 



at the stem end, so I bad to back 
fifty feet to a side tube. 

Six hours to go, and still I 
couldn’t find the neutron star. Prob- 
ably I would see it only for an in- 
stant, passing at better than half the 
speed of light. Already my ^ed 
must be enormous. 

Were the stars turning blue? 

Two hours to go, I was sure they 
were turning blue. Was my speed 
that high? Then the stars behind 
should be red. Machinery blocked 
the view behind me, so I used the 
gyros. The ship turned with peculiar 
sluggishness. And the stars behind 
were blue, not red. All around me 
were blue-white stars. 

Imagine light falling into a savage- 
ly steep gravitational well. It won’t 
accelerate. Light can’t move faster 
than light. But it can gain in energy, 
in frequency. The light was falling 
on me, harder and harder as I drop- 
ped. 

I told the dictaphone about it. 
That dictaphone was probably the 
best protected item on the ship. I 
had already decided to earn my 
money by using it, just as if I expect- 
ed to collect. Privately I wondered 
just how intense the light would 
get. 

Skydiver had drifted back to ver- 
tical, with its axis through the neu- 
tron star, but now it faced outward. 
I’d thought I had the ship stopped 
horizontally. More clumsiness. I used 
the gyros. Again the ship moved 
mushily, until it was halfway through 
the swing. Then it semed to fall au- 
tomatically into place. It was as if 
the Skydiver preferred to have its 
axis through the neutron star. 



NEUTRON STAR 



17 




I didn’t like that in the least. 
I tried the maneuver again, and 
again the Skydiver fought back. But 
this time there was something else. 
Something was pulling at me. 

So I unfastened my safety net 
and fell headfirst into the nose. 

T he pull was light, about a tenth 
of a gee. It felt more like sink- 
ing through honey than falling. I 
climbed back into my chair, tied 
myself in with the net, now hang- 
ing face down, turned on the dicta- 
phone. I told my story in such nit- 
picking detail that my hypothetical 
listeners could not but doubt my 
hypothetical sanity. “I think this is 
what happened to the Laskins,” I 
finished. “If the pull increases. I’ll 
call back.” 

Think? I never doubted it. This 
strange, gentle pull was inexplicable. 
Something inexplicable had killed 
Peter and Sonya Laskin. Q.E.D. 

Around the point where the neu- 
tron star must be, the stars were 
like smeared dots of oilpaint, smear- 
ed radially. They glared with an 
angry, painful light. I hung face down 
in the net and tried to think. 

It was an hour before I was sure. 
The pull was increasing. And I still 
had an hour to fall. 

Something was pulling on me, but 
not on the ship. 

^ No, that was nonsense. What 
could reach out to me through a 
General Products hull? It must be 
the other way around. Something 
was pushing on the ship, pusthing it 
off course. 

If it got worse I could use the 
drive to compensate. Meanwhile, the 



ship was being pushed away from 
BVS-1, which was fine by me. 

But if I was wrong, if the ship 
were not somehow being pushed 
away from BVS-1, the rocket mo- 
tor would send the Skydiver crash- 
ing into eleven miles of neutronium. 

And why wasn’t the rocket al- 
ready firing? If the ship was being 
pusihed off course, the autopilot 
should be fighting back. The accele- 
rometer was in good order. It had 
looked fine when I made my in- 
spection tour down the access tube. 

Could something be pushing on 
the ship and on the accelerometer, 
but not on me? 

It came down to the same im- 
possibility. Something that could 
reach through a General Products 
hull. 

To hell with theory, said I to my- 
self, said I. I’m getting out of here. 
To the dictaphone I said, “The pull 
has increased dangerously. I’m go- 
ing to try to alter my orbit.” 

Of course, once I turned the shin 
outward and used the rocket. I’d be 
adding my own acceleration to the 
X force. It would be a strain, but I 
could stand it for awhile. If I came 
within a mile of BVS-1, I’d end like 
Sonya Laskin. 

She must have waited face down 
in a net like mine, waited without a 
drive unit, waited while the pressure 
rose and the net cut into her flesh, 
waited until the net snapped and 
dropped her into the nose, to lie 
crushed and broken until the X 
force tore the very chairs loose and 
dropped them on her. 

I hit the gyros. 

The gyros weren’t strong enough 



18 



IF 




to turn me. I tried it three times. 
Bach time the ship rotated about 
fifty degrees and hung there, mo- 
tionless, while the whine of the gyros 
went up and up. Released, the ship 
immediately swung back to position. 
I was nose down to the neutron star, 
and I was going to stay that way. 

H alf an hour to fall, and the X 
force was over a gee. My sin- 
uses were in agony. My eyes were 
ripe and ready to fall out. I don’t 
know if I could bave stood a ciga- 
rette, but I didn’t get tihe chance. 
My pack of Fortunados had fallen 
out of my pocket, when I dropped 
into the nose. There it was, four 
feet beyond my fingers, proof that 
the X force acted on other objects 
besides me. Fascinating. 

I couldn’t take any more. If it 
dropped me shrieking into the neu- 
tron star. I had to use the drive. And 
I did. I ran the thrust up until I was 
approximately in free fall. The blood 
which had pooled in my extremities 
went back where it belonged. The 
gee dial registered one point two gee. 
I cursed it for a lying robot. 

The soft-pack was bobbing around 
in the nose, and it occurred to me 
that a little extra nudge on the throt- 
tle would bring it to me. I tried 
it. The pack drifted toward me, and 
I reached, and like a sentient thing 
it speeded up to avoid my clutching 
hand. I snatched at it again as it 
went past my ear, but again it was 
moving too fast. That pack was 
going at a hell of a clip, considering 
that here I was, practically in free 
fall. It dropped through the door to 
the relaxation room, still picking up

speed, blurred and vanished as it en- 
tered the access tube. Seconds later 
I heard a solid Thump. 

But that was crazy- Already the 
X force was pulling blood into my 
face. I pulled my lighter out, held 
it at arm’s length and let go. It fell 
gently into the nose. But the pack 
of Fortunados had hit like I’d 
dropped it from a building. 

Well. 

I nudged the throttle again. The 
mutter of fusing hydrogen reminded 
me that if I tried to keep this up all 
the way, I might well put the General 
Products hull to its toughest test 
yet: smashing it into a neutron star 
at half lightspeed. I could see it now: 
a transparent hull containing only 
a few cubic inches of dwarf star 
matter wedged into the tip of the 
nose. 

At one point four gee, according 
to that lying gee dial, the lighter 
came loose and drifted toward me. 
I let it go. It was clearly falling 
when it reached the doorway. I 
pulled the throttle back. The loss 
of power jerked me violently for- 
ward, but I kept my face turned. 
The lighter slowed and hesitated at 
the entrance to the access tube. De- 
cided to go through. I cocked my 
ears for the sound, then jumped 
as the whole ship rang like a gong. 

And the accelerometer was right 
at the ship’s center of mass. Other- 
wise the ship’s mass would have 
thrown the needle off. The puppe- 
teers were fiends for ten-decimal- 
point accuracy. 

I favored the dictaphone with a 
few fast comments, then got to work 
reprogramming the autopilot. Luck- 



ily whait I wanted was simple. The 
X force was but an X force to me, 
but now I knew how it behaved. I 
might actually live through this. 

T he stars were fiercely blue, 
warped to streaked lines near 
that special point. I thought I could 
see it now, very small and dim 
and red; but it might have been 
imagination. In twenty minutes. I’d 
be rounding the neutron star. The 
drive grumbled behind me. In effec- 
tive free fall, I unfastened the safety 
net and pushed myself out of the 
chair. 

A gentle push aft — and ghostly 
hands grasped my legs. Ten pounds 
of weight hung by my fingers from 
the back of the chair. The pressure 
should drop fast. I’d programmed 
the autopilot to reduce the thrust 
from two gees to zero during the 
next two minutes. All I had to do was 
be at the center of mass, in the 
access tube, when the thrust went 
to zero. 

Something gripped the ship 
through a General Products hull. A 
psychokinetic life form stranded on 
a sun twelve miles in diameter? But 
how could anything alive stand such 
gravity? 

Something might be stranded in 
orbit. There is life in space: out- 
siders and sailseeds and maybe oth- 
ers we haven’t found yet. For all I 
knew or cared, BVS-1 itself might 
be alive. It didn’t matter. I knew 
what the X force was trying to do. 
It was trying to pull the ship apart. 

There was no pull on my fingers. 
I pushed aft and landed on the back 
wall, on bent legs. I knelt over the 



20 



IF 




door, looking aft/down. When free 
fall came, I pulled myself through 
and was in the relaxation room look- 
ing down/forward into the nose. 

Gravity was changing faster than I 
liked. The X force was growing as 
zero hour approached, while the 
compensating rocket thrust dropped. 
The X force tended to pull the ship 
apart; it was two gee forward at the 
nose, two gee backward at the tail 
and diminished to zero at the center 
of mass. Or so I hoped. The pack 
and lighter had behaved as if the 
force pulling them had increased 
for every inch they moved stern- 
ward. 

The dictaphone was fifty feet be- 
low, utterly unreachable. If I had 
anything more to say to General 
Products. I’d have to say it in per- 
son. Maybe I’d get the chance. Be- 
cause I knew what force was trying 
to tear the ship apart. 

It was the tide. 

T he motor was off, and I was at 
the ship’s midpoint. My spread- 
eagled position was getting uncom- 
fortable. It was four minutes to 
perihelion. 

Something creaked in the cabin 
below me. I , couldn’t see what it 
was, but I could clearly see a red 
point glaring among blue radial lines, 
like a lantern at the bottom of a well. 
To the sides, between the fusion 
tube and the tanks and other equip- 
ment, the blue stars glared at me 
with a light that was almost violet. 

I was afraid to look too long. I 
actually thought they might blind 
me. 

There must have been hundreds of 



gravities in the cabin. I could even 
feel the pressure change. The air 
was thin at this height, one hundred 
and fifty feet above the control room. 

And now, almost suddenly, the red 
dot was more than a dot. My time 
was up. A red disc leapt up at me; 
the ship swung around me; and I 
gasped and shut my eyes tight. Gi- 
ants’ hands gripped my arms and 
legs and head, gently but with great 
fimmess, and tried to pull me in 
two. In that moment it came to 
me that Peter Laskin had died like 
this. He’d made the same guesses I 
had, and he’d tried to hide in the 
access tube. But he’d slipped. As I 
was slipping . 

When I got my eyes open the red 
dot was shrinking into nothing. 

IV 

T he puppeteer president insisted 
I be put in a hospital for ob- 
servation. I didn’t fight the idea. My 
face and bands were flaming red, 
with blisters rising, and I ached like 
I’d been beaten. Rest and tender 
loving care, that’s what I wanted. 

I was floating between a pair of 
sleeping plates, hideously uncomfort- 
able, when the nurse came to an- 
nounce a visitor. I knew who it was 
from her peculiar expression. 

“What can get through a General 
Products hull?” I asked it. 

“I hoped you would tell me.” The 
president rested on its single back 
leg, holding a stick that gave off 
green, incense-smelling smoke. 

“And so I will. Gravity.” 

“Do not play with me, Beowulf 
Shaeffer. This matter is vital.” 



NEUTRON STAR

“I’m not playing. Does your world 
have a moon?” 

“That information is classified.” 
The puppeteers are cowards. No- 
body knows where they come from, 
and nobody is likely to find out. 

“Do you know what happens 
when a moon gets too close to its 
primary?” 

“It falls apart.” 

Why?” 

“I do not know.” 

“Tides.” 

“What is a tide?” 

Oho, said I to myself, said I. 
“I’m going to try to tell you. The 
Earth’s moon is almost two thou- 
sand miles in diameter and does not 
rotate with respect to Earth. I want 
you to pick two rocks on the Moon, 
one at the point nearest the Earth, 
one at the point furthest away.” 
“Very well.” 

“Now, isn’t it obvious that if 
those rocks were left to themselves 
they’d fall away from each other? 
They’re in two different orbits, mind 
you, concentric orbits, one almost 
two thousand miles outside the oth- 
er. Yet those rocks are forced to 
move at the same orbital speed.” 
“The one outside is moving faster.” 
“Good point. So there is a force 
trying to pull the Moon apart. Gravi- 
ty holds it together. Bring the Moon 
close enough to Earth, and those 
two rocks would simply float away.” 
“I see. Then this tide tried to pull 
your ship apart. It was powerful 
enough in the lifesystem of the In- 
stitute ship to pull the acceleration 
chairs out of their mounts.” 

“And to crush a human being. 
Picture it. The ship’s nose was just 



seven miles from the center of BVS- 
1. The tail was three hundred feet 
fuiUher out. Left to themselves they’d 
have gone in completely different 
orbits. My head and feet tried to 
do the same thing, when I got close 
enough.” 

“I see. Are you moulting?” 
“What?” 

“I noticed you are losing your 
outer integument in spots.” 

“Oh, that, I got a bad sunburn 
from exposure to starlight.” 

Two heads stared at each other 
for an eyeblink. A shrug? The pup- 
peteer said, “We have deposited the 
remainder of your pay with the 
Bank of We M^e It. One Sigmund 
Ausfailler, human, has frozen the 
account until your taxes are com- 
puted.” “Figures.” 

“If you will talk to reporters now, 
explaining what happened to the In- 
stitute ship, we will pay you ten 
thousand stars. We will pay cash so 
that you may use it immediately. It 
is urgent. There have been rumors.” 
“Bring ’em in.” As an afterthought 
I added, “I can also tell them that 
your world is moonless. That should 
be good for a footnote somewhere.” 
“I do not understand.” But two 
long necks had drawn back, and 
the puppeteer was watching me like 
a pair of pythons. 

“You’d know what a tide wa? if 
you had a moon. You couldn’t avoid 
it.” 

“Would you be interested in . .” 
“. a million stars? I’d be fas- 
cinated. I’ll even sign a contract if 
it includes what we’re hiding. How 
do you like being blackmailed?”

Your 

Soldier Unto Deafli 

by MICHAEL WALKER 



They were Man's greatest heroes. 
They'd won a war — but now what 
was there left for them to do? 



O n the final day of the confliot 
Infantry Commiander Third 
Class RB-1079AX, soldier in the ser- 
vice of Man, had driven a file of 
heavy infantry out of western high- 
lands to meet the enemy of his mas- 
ters. 

Rocket-fire had long since knock- 
ed out his command vehicle, and for 
half a day he had fought shoulder- 
to-shoulder with his soldiers, con- 
tinuously alert to the dictates of 
Over-Command that filled his head- 
set and mechanically relaying them 
to his decimated phalanx in an un- 
inflected voice that had grown hoarse 
with the passage of time. At length. 



Over-Command had issued orders of 
termination and had closed down its 
frequency, leaving him trembling 
now in a sudden shock of silence, 
a sticky mace swinging in his hand. 
An enemy soldier-form beside him 
lowered its rifle, relaxed its coils 
and wriggled away through the freez- 
ing mud. Around him in the twi- 
light, soldiers turned against the 
death-scented wind and straggled to- 
ward their recovery zones. 

He had known that the battle on 
this planet could not last much long- 
er. The end was a shock only to his 
strained body — the recent trends in 
the battle had forewarned his care-

fuiUy trained mind. There had been 
heavy losses. If the forces of Man 
had sought retribution, the battle 
might have lasted another day. But 
the war had never been vindictive to 
the extent that a satisfactory position 
would be sacrificed to emotion. 
While he was but dimly aware of 
such things as emotions and of their 
roles as determininates in the strategic 
decisions of Men, he had suspected 
from experience that the end was 
near. 

A little dazed, he consulted a map- 
board incorporated into the 
sleeve of his battle armor and turned, 
stumbled northward through the in- 
terminable litter of bodies. In the 
offal of the day-long attrition he saw 
an occasional familiar face. For some 
reason he faltered and paused to look 
into one. 

RB-2442AY lay on his side, the 
left leg below the knee crushed flat 
by a tank. A medic hurried by, 
halting only to spray the breastplate 
of the fallen soldier with fluorescent 
paint — unsalvageable. The soldier, 
who had somehow withstood the 
shock of his injury, took no notice. 
His pain-tightened eyes passed over 
his commander without recognition 
or feeling. RB-1079AX watched him 
for a moment more and touched the 
butt of his sidearm, vaguely wonder- 
ing if the dam aged -soldier might not 
be able to fight again, perhaps with 
an artificial limb — he had fought 
with him for so long. But the splash 
of paint said no, and the commander 
moved on. 

An hour later he had collected 
the tired remnant of his phalanx in 



the recovery zone and had submitted 
his final status report to Over-Oom- 
mand, where Men listened calmly 
and drew their plans for the future. 
But for him the work here was 
done. 

Now began a time of waiting. At 
first, for transportation. Later, for 
the command that would send him 
to another battlefield on some new 
world. 

Squatting in their midst, he watch- 
ed the survivors quietly, listening to 
the rattle of final preparation and 
the cries of the salvageable wounded, 
punctuated at decreasing intervals by 
a muted thunder that was building 
in the west. Eventually, a formation 
of ships moved over the plain, slow- 
ing, and in the deepening night his 
transport slipi>ed out of the sky and 
touched down a kilometer away. 

He marched his soldiers across the 
blasted terrain and up the extend- 
ed ramps, pausing for a moment to 
see all of his command aboard. Over- 
head, moving up from the horizon, a 
chain of bright beads stretched itself 
across the sky, passing among the 
stars. The beads were enemy trans- 
ports following on the same orbital 
track. As they crossed the zenith, 
each flared up briefly and slowed as 
it broke orbit for planet-fall on some 
battlefield on the other side of the 
world. He went into the ship. 

Scattered on the plain, the aban- 
doned wounded let their eyes fall 
beneath patient, hooded lids as the 
transports rose and mounted on 
columns of fire. 

T he windows of the small office 
overlooked a flat sweep of des-

IF 




ert that stretched uninterrupted to 
a wall of hazy mountains that edged 
the horizon. Nearby, the desert was 
patterned with the geometric preci- 
sion of maneuvering soldiers. On the 
right the beginnings of a complex 
of corrugated aluminum barracks 
were visible. 

It was very hot. The hum of air- 
conditioning shut out the noises of 
the base. 

Major General Blackwood sat 
behind a bare desk, silhouetted 
against the windows. Across the desk 
a small, balding man in civilian dress 
sat stiffly in a straight-backed chair, 
holding a plastic folder in his lap. 
Between them, at the side of the 
desk, a woman leaned forward 
anxiously from a leather-upholstered 
seat. 

“We were told through normal 
channels that the wair had ended, 
Mr. Chalmers,” the general said. “I 
don’t quite see the point of your 
visit.” There was a note of hostility 
in his quiet voice. 

Chalmers coughed and looked 
toward the woman apologetically. 
“Actually, General, I’m here for 
something else. Terra Central sent 
me out to appraise the Empress of 
certain diplomatic aspects of the 
peace that wfe felt were too delicate 
for direct broadcast. She suggested 
that we take them up with you, 
since you’re closer to the problem, 
so to speak.” He looked toward the 
window meaninigfully. 

General Blackwood, refusing to 
interpret his glance, leaned forward 
slowly. “Get to the point.” 

“Well, as you know, the peace is 
not decisive. There was surrender on 



neither side. We’ve merely reached 
a permanent understanding. In the 
past year, the war became so vicious 
that only complete ruin for both 
us and the Kreekal could have re- 
sulted from its continuance. I don’t 
suppose you realize it, but the con- 
flict had actually been extended from 
the disputed colonial planets to the 
home systems.” He fumbled in his 
folder and produced a photograph, 
held it carefully. “We suffered ter- 
rible losses. Last month the Kreekal 
struck at the Terran system with 
the ‘better part of their fleet. Earth 
was saved, but to hold them off we 
had to contract the system’s defen- 
sive sphere drastically. Mars was 
sacrificed.” 

He slid the glossy print across the 
desk, and the general picked it up 
casually, looked at a brilliant yellow- 
white disk set against star-iflecked 
blackness. He glanced from the pic- 
ture to Chalmers. 

“I take it this isn’t the natural 
Martian albedo?” 

“That isn’t reflection at all. Gen- 
eral. The surface was still incandes- 
cent when the picture was taken, 
two days after the attack. They 
blanketed the planet with hell- 
bombs. Naturally, there were no 
survivors. Two billion died.” 

“I suppose we were avenged,” the 
general said, not really wanting to 
know and definitely not wanting to 
know now. He had said what was 
expected of him. 

“We hit back at their home sys- 
tem. Their sun was extinguished.” 

“And that settled it, I suppose? 
The rest of the war was incidental 
to the conclusion — just for the 



YOUR SOLDIER UNTO DEATH 



25 




sake of fonn while teims were be* 
ing settled?” 

sorry, General. I understand 
your bittemess, but it doesn’t real- 
ly matter, does it?” 

General (Blackwood gazed levelly 
at the Empress, realizing what was 
comiing, then looked back at Chal- 
mers. “My army alone lost several 
million soldiers durmig the last 
weeks, Mr Chalmers. That matters 
very much. Make your point.” 

“The point is, damn it, that the 
human race has got five billion sol- 
diers on its hands with no more wars 
to fight. Terra Control has ordered 
that they be destroyed.” 

T he general nodded, looking down 
at the desk. “Yes. I thought it 
would come to this. But why were 
you sent?” 

“Terra Central thought an unac- 
companied directive of this nature 
would seem a little too arbitrary. 
They thought if I delivered it, it 
would . well . Chalmers 
faltered, embarrassed by what he 
had to say. “They thought it would 
be less inhuman, this way.” 

The general laughed harshly, but 
immediately regreted his cruelty. He 
did not envy Chalmers’s responsibili- 
ty. He ‘became aware that the Em- 
press was speaking to him. 

“Can’t you .explain this to us, 
General?” she asked. “Mr. Chalmers 
assured us that this expedient was 
necessary, but we don’t quite un- 
derstand why. Why can’t the men be 
deactivated and returned to civilian 
life?” 

The general did not reply, and 
after a while Chalmers spoke for 



bdinL He Ihad rehearsed it to himself 
80 meny times that it mo longer 
sounded oonvlnoiag to him, but he 
recited it meticulously. He looked 
at the Empress. 

“As you know, the Kreekan so- 
ciety is hive-oriented. Their soldier- 
forms are adapted from the vast 
worker element of their community 
and are conditioned to fight from 
the moment of hatching. Mankind 
had never faced an opposition or- 
ganized along these lines, ‘but the 
very nature of the conflict demanded 
that we fight them on their own 
terms — that is, in land wars on 
the contested planets. 

“Two hundred years ago, the 
worlds under the control of Terra 
Central began to develop a warrior 
class to match the Kreekan soldier- 
forms. Great numbers of men were 
needed, and each system recruited an 
independent army from male in- 
fants purchased at birth from their 
parents. 

“To meet the personnel require- 
ments, virtually the entire male por- 
tion of the human race has come to 
be tied up in the service of Man. 
They are trained from birth, and 
their training consists of two parts. 
The first is the complete focusing 
of all emotion into a single drive 
to destroy Kreekan soldier-forms, 
and the second is the development of 
the physical and technical prowess 
necessary to implement the first. In 
short, the infants are reared so 
that their only feeling is one of en- 
mity toward the Kreekal, and their 
only skill is a propensity for destroy- 
ing Kreekal. Tbey are exact coun- 
terparts of the Kreekan soldier- 



26 



IF 




forms. They are machines designed 
to serve one purpose, and with the 
end of the war that purpose has 
ceased to exist. They no longer 
have an object in life.” He paused, 
having said what was needed. There 
would be questions and objections, 
but he had stated the case. 

“I think we see the difficulty,” 
the Empress said. “But why? Wliy 
was this done to them?” 

C halmers started to answer, but 
the general interrupted him — 
rather bluntly, as Chalmers thought. 

“Your Highness, the enemy has 
a great deal in common with com- 
munal insects: A small aristocracy 
and a huge mindless working class. 
I say mindless advisedly. Single- 
minded is what I mean. They are 
generated to work — or in time of 
war, to kill. The distinction is 
slight, since there’s no real emotion 
involved in either. With them, wield- 
ing a gun is little different from 
wielding a shovel. This isn’t so with 
mature men. The greater part of 
training an adult human to kill has 
never been the development of the 
killer instinct and the killer skills 
— these are always present, if lat- 
ent. It has been, rather, the sup- 
pression of the array of gentler in- 
stincts that have been generated in 
the course of a normal life: Love, 
ambition, social instincts and so 
forth. Getting rid of these is the 
problem. And to meet the mechani- 
cal animosity of the Kreekal, it 
just wasn’t practical to start out with 
mature men whose very way of life 
had conditioned them against war- 
fare with an absolutely passionless 



adversary. It just wasn’t practical. 
Hell, it wasn’t possible. We had to 
start with blank slates, and we 
needed a lot of them.” 

But couldn’t they be retrained. 
General?” 

“No. They’re lost to us in that 
respect. Your Highness. Naturally, 
we’ve looked into it completely. 
They’re like the survivors who are 
sometimes found on colonial worlds 
that were thought to have been total- 
ly depopulated by disease. Abandon- 
ed as infants, they grow up entirely 
on their own, roaming in the wild, 
and when they’re finally brought 
back into the fold they can never ad- 
just. Maybe they can learn a few 
words — a few simple tasks — but 
they remain subhuman. They never 
develop social skills.” 

“But these men must have social 
skills already. General. They’re 
members of an army — they have 
comrades. And they can speak.” 

“The basic lack is the same,” the 
general explained unhappily. “The 
factor underlying meaningful so- 
ciety is the sexual drive and its 
fulfillment, but these men have 
no sexual outlet in fhe ordinary 
sense. Harnassing that drive has 
been our greatest problem. Initially, 
we had contemplated castration, but 
if it’s performed early it interferes 
with the physical development we re- 
quire, and after maturiity it’s out of 
the question — the trauma would 
destroy the psychological balance 
we set for them from birth. Homo- 
sexual outlets are even more out 
of the question — we can’t afford 
to have any feeling of affection de- 
veloping between comrades. They 



YOUR SOLDIER UNTO DEATH 



27 




are trained to think of each other 
as they would of any other piece 
of military equipment — as gears in 
a mechanism of which they are a 

part and this ultimate, impersonal 

rationality is all that has allowed us 
to operate successfully against the 
enemy. 

“All that remained was to sup- 
ply them with women at regular 
intervals, which we do. One woman 
can service a great many soldiers, 
and it proved the most practical 
solution. But other than a very basic 
sort of tenderness toward their sex- 
ual partners, emotion doesn’t enter 
into the relationships. They have no 
emotions. They’re incapable of any 
sort of reciprocal relationship. They 
don’t even recognize the females as 
human. Or themselves, for that mat- 
ter. We never teach their females to 
speak, you know — there’s no 
reason to.” 

T hey were silent for a moment, 
and when she spoke, the Em- 
press gave voice to what they were 
all feeling. “I think this is rather 
awful. General. I don’t believe most 
of us have quite realized what was 
going on.” 

Chalmers came to the general’s 
rescue. “Precisely, Your Highness. 
That’s why Terra Central didn’t send 
their directive out through ordinary 
channels. No one is ever to know 
what has happened. God knows how 
close we came to extinction in this 
mess. All that saved the human 
race is this terrible thing we’ve done. 
That’s all in the past, now, though 
— for better or worse. We’re at 
peace, and the new format is co- 



operation and cohabitation with the 
Kreekal. Our soldiers simply could 
not survive in such a context, or 
even be permitted to enter it. They 
can’t be taught to support themselves, 
and now that we’re off the war 
footage we can’t afford to support 
them ourselves. They lived off rav- 
aged worlds in the past — where 
are they to find sustenance now? We 
did something terrible in creating 
them, and we must do something 
just as awful to dispose of them. 

“There’s no possibility of beating 
swords into ploughshares — not in 
this case. These are not so much men 
as tliey are weapK)ns. They have no 
versatility. Versatility was painstak- 
ingly bred out of them. 

“No, Your Highness. Tanks may 
be converted to tractors, but the vir- 
tue of this human steel is in its 
temper. Any attempt to reforge it 
would leave us with nothing.” 

The Empress smiled gently. “Your 
point is well taken, Mr. Chalmers. 
But I think that in putting our ra- 
tionalizations into words we tend 
to become rather too picturesque. 
These are human beings, after all. 
Let’s deal with them in human 
terms.” 

“I’m sorry,’’ Chalmers said. “What 
I mean to say is that they’ve been 
forced into the mold so tightly that 
they would be shattered completely 
if their molds were removed. I don’t 
think they’re psychologically equip- 
ped to deal with any situation other 
than the one they’re in. Certainly 
they’re not capable of independent 
action. They act only in response to 
their superiors, and their superiors 
are ultimately men.” 



23 



IF 




“Damn it, Chalmers,” the general 
snapped. “You insist on segregating 
them under this aibsurd ‘they.* They 
are men, Chalmers. Their victory 
wasn’t won for your exclusive ‘us’ — 
it was won for the human race. For 
themselves. It’s not fair to shut them 
out!” The general fell silent, realiz- 
ing that he had begun to plead. 

“No, it’s not fair,” Chalmers re- 
plied. “But it’s necessary. Never 
have so few owed so much to so 
many, and yet what can we do for 
them in return? We haven’t the 
means to support five billion non- 
productive men. Assuming they were 
susceptible to retraining, we haven’t 
the means to effect even that. They’re 
no longer a necessity to our sur- 
vival, and we have other work to 
do. If we don’t destroy them, they’ll 
die horribly of starvation — or 
worse. You know that.” 

The general said nothing. 

“We need so badly to expand our 
population now,” the Empress ven- 
tured. “Couldn’t they take mates? 
There are so many more women 
than men — couldn’t the women 
shoulder the load? It would just be 
for one generation.” 

The general shook his head. “The 
soldiers have no conception of re- 
production. There is no creche on 
this world, and they have never seen 
children. They could only serve as 
stud animals, and for that there are 
enough normal men.” 

“But what becomes of the sol- 
diers who grow too old to fight?” 
she asked. “Surely you don’t liquidate 
them?” 

“No, Your Highness. That’s one 
problem we haven’t had to face. 



You see, no one grows old in the 
service of Man.” 

She stared at the general help- 
lessly. “But you say nothing in 
their behalf. You’re signing their 
death order!” she cried desperately, 
accusingly. 

“I know I am,” he answCT^, and 
there was a tightness in his v<xce that 
made her drop her eyes in shame. 

After a long moment the general 
looked at Chalmers, but it was to 
her that he spoke. “I’ve arranged 
to have one of the soldiers drop 
by. You may want to talk to him 
— he’ll be in the outer office. If 
you don’t mind. I’ll wait here.” 

I nfantry Commander Third Class 
RB-1079AX had been summoned 
from the exercise field eariy in the 
morning, and had been told at the 
barracks to repK>rt to the general’s 
quarters at noon. He had spent the 
morning in unaccustomed idleness, 
sitting on his bunk and listening to 
the sounds that drifted in through 
the open door. A half hour before 
noon he had showered and dressed 
in clean fatigues and now stood in 
the general’s deserted staff office, 
waiting. 

The inner door opened, and two 
strange men emerg^ and stopped 
before him. He saluted and stood 
at attention. Neither of the strangers 
was in military dress, and it soon be- 
came apparent that one of them was 
not a Man at all, but something more 
like a She. He had never seen a 
She in the company of Men before, 
but from the contours of its loose, 
peculiar cut tunic he could see that 
its body must more nearly approxi- 



YOUR SOLDIER UNTO DEATH 



29 




mate that of a She than that of a 
Maa or a soldier. The tunic in itself 
was suiprising ,for Ihe lhad seldom 
seea a She with dothing of any sort. 
Its undad legs were unifmred, and 
there was a heavy growth of hair 
on its head, neither of which was 
typical of a She, but he conjectured 
that it might be some sort of form 
peculi-ar to Men — a sort of Man- 
She, perhaps. He waited for infor- 
mation that might confirm his 
theory. 

Then, shockingly, the She looked 
at him — and spoke: “What a mag- 
nificent Man.” 

He turned and looked, but there 
was no Man in evidence. He looked 
at the She, puzzled, and noticed that 
it was in pain. He picked up a phone 
from a vacant desk and named the 
hospital extension, ordered a medic 
to die general’s quarters. When he 
looked up, the general was beside 
him. 

“Sir, the She had water in its 
eyes. I have asked for Medic, sir,” he 
replied. 

The general took the phone from 
him and cancelled the order, replac- 
ed the receiver. “It’s okay. Com- 
mander. The She is all right.” He 
walked the commander to the other 
side of the room and, putting a hand 
on his shoulder, spoke to him in a 
low voice,, watching the others. 
“Look, Commander, this She and the 
Man. with it might want to ask you 
a couple of questions. They may 
not be too -pertinent, but just an- 
swer the best you can and don’t 
worry about it, huh?” 

“Okay, sir,” he said. 

He faced the strangers careful- 



ly. The General spoke to them, 
and after a moment the She ap- 
proadhed him. 

“Who are you?” the She asked. 

“Infantry Commander Third 
Class RB- 1079 AX, soldier in the 
service of man . sir.” 

“But what are you?” 

He repeated the information. 

“Yes, I see,” the She said. “You 
are a soldier. Will you always be a 
soldier?” Its voice was quiet.' 

“Until death.” 

“But what would happen to you 
if there were no more wars? If 
there were no more enemies to 
fight?” 

He did not answer. 

“Don’t you know that you’re a 
Man?” 

He did not answer. 

The general stepped between them 
and winked at him. “That’s all, com- 
mander. You can leave now. Pick 
up your routine this afternoon.” 

He saluted and left the general’s 
quarters. 

44T Tas he no dress uniform?. 

JnL asked the Empress, eager to 
break the hiatus of silence that had 
descended in the wake of the sol- 
dier. 

“There are no dress uniforms,” 
the general said without expression. 
“The dress uniform is a mark of 
the juncture o-f the military and so- 
cial spheres. There is no society 
here.” 

“I’m sorry. I thought he might 
not have been intelligent enough 
to . that is, I thought he might 
not have known ...” She paused, 
uncertain of what she had wanted 



30 



IF 




to say. Then she simply said, “He 
seem^ awfully stupid.” 

The general did not smile. “With 
respect to intelligence, you know, 
there isn’t one person in ten thou- 
sand who could approach him. He is, 
of course, much more clever than 
any of us. I felt he would acquit 
himself well.” 

He 'beckoned to Chalmers and 
turned to the Empress. “If you 
would wait here for a moment. Your 
Highness. I will have a word with 
Mr. Chalmers.” 

They went into the inner office 
together. 

“I suppose she represents the 
typical reaction to the soldier,” 
Chalmers remarked when the door 
was closed. “A magnificent, pathetic 
creature whose way of life offends 



her sense of propriety and whose 
intelligence is oriented in a way 
she can’t comprehend.” 

The general had not heard. “I 
won’t let them die,” he whispered. It 
was 'his duty to say it. 

“The nerve gas is painless and 
instantaneous,” Chalmers said, dis- 
regarding the general and disregard- 
ing something within himself that 
echoed the general’s words. “Several 
bases have already been treated. The 
exterminators are orbiting a few 
thousand miles out. I’ll have them 
come down tomorrow morning. It 
will be over in a few minutes.” 

“I can*t let them die.” 

“Yes you can,” said Chalmers 
heavily.” 

“We all can. We have to.”

Strange girls! Their clothes 
vanished from time to time, 
and their home was — nowhere! 



L unching at the Red Lion on roast 
beef of Old England, I glanced 
out of the upstairs window and saw, 
across the road, a girl in a pink suit. 

A moment later I choked. A mor- 
sel of meat went down the wrong 
way, and for a second or two, fight- 
ing for breath, eyes streaming, I 
couldn’t see anything. 

When I could see again she was 
just a girl in a pink suit walking 
along a narrow street in a quiet town, 
possibly the quietest country town in 
England. I went back to the roast 
beef. What I had thought I saw was 
a trick of the sunlight, obviously. 

Many remarkable and some impos- 
sible things had been attributed to 
the sun in the last month or two, 
since a preternaturally hot summer 
took England by surprise, A hot sum- 
mer always took England by surprise. 
When Byron wrote of the English 
winter ending in July to recommence 
in August, he wasn’t coining an epi- 
gram. He was merely stating the ob- 
vious. 

But this year . 

•In Shuteley we weren’t concerned 
with things that happened in London, 
Liverpool or Leeds. In places like 
that anything could happen. When 
we heard that three Socialist M.P.s 
had turned up at the House of Com- 
mons dressed in sandals and shorts, 
we sniffed and decided to vote Tory 
next time (as we ; did anyway). 
In Shuteley, however: 



The river was so low that about 
four miles upstream you could walk 
across, something which had never 
happened (before in the history of 
Shuteley — which went back to the 
Ark. 

We had the first-ever traffic jam 
in the center of town, and it was 
caused by a mini-car sticking in 
melted and churned-oip tar. 

A poacher claimed in court that 
the trout he took from a pool was 
not only dead, but already cooked. 
Althou^ this was agreed to be the 
tale to 'beat all anglers’ tales, he was 
discharged without a stain on his 
character (except those which were 
there already). 

T he hot summer was not, we were 
told, caused by anything of any 
permanent significance. Next year 
the temperature would probaibly be 
normal. A combination of factors, 
said the meteorologists (and they’d 
go into a wealth of detail if you gave 
them half a Chance) was keeping 
the temperature up and the rainfall 
down. Such conditions might not re- 
cur for two hundred years. 

Every year I could remember, and 
I could remember about thirty, plus 
a few more about which I had vague 
childhood impressions, people had 
complained about the poor summer. 
Now they complained about the hot 
summer. 

The dining room at the Red Lion, 

IF

directly above the bar, was the pleas- 
antest room in Shuteley, and that was 
probably why I nearly always lunch- 
ed there, in spite of the food. It had 
windows on three sides, a high roof, 
oak stalls which insured quiet as well 
as privacy, spotless linen and middle- 
ag^ waitresses who afforded no pos- 
sible distraction. It was the kind of 
room you often find in a very old 
town, not aggressively modern, not 
dating back to Magna Carta — a 
room which had been many things 
in its time, which had been modified 
and renovated and redecorated time 
and again, but never until it cried 
out for it, which had been left alone 
apart from cleaning and painting for 
at least thirty years. 

Also, it was never too hot. You 
had to say this for solid old build- 
ings — there wasn’t much they could 
not keep out. I sighed as I finished 
the apple tart. And I wished . 

I wasn’t old. I was thirty-three. I 
was married to a pretty girl nine 
years younger. As manager of an 
important insurance office, I was 
probably one of the three most im- 
portant men in Shuteley. I had no 
money worries, no health worries, no 
children to worry about, no relatives 
to worry -about, except Dina and a 
mother in a mental home. And by 
the time people are in a mental home 
and so far gone that the medical staff 
advises you not to visit them, there’s 
certainly no point in worrying about 
them. 

I was probably envied. I couldn’t 
be sure, because a young boss has to 
be careful. He can’t be too friendly, 
or people take advantage. 



I was pretty solitary and old be- 
fore my time. 

And I wished something would 
happen. 

I’d heard a story about the two- 
year-old son of the principal English 
master at the Grammar School. The 
infant had been at his first kids’ 
party, and he didn’t like it. He was 
found under the Christmas tree, cry- 
ing his eyes out. Asked why, in the 
middle of all the fun and games, he 
wasn’t happy like everybody else, he 
said: “I’m so terribly, terribly bored.” 

Well, a kid like that was only re- 
peating what he’d heard at home. 
Poor kid, he thought it was impres- 
sively grown-up to be bored. 

I wasn’t two. I wasn’t bored, ex- 
actly. I just wanted something to 
happen, sure that when things set- 
tled down afterwards they couldn’t 
be worse and might easily be bette; . 

And something happened. 

II 

W hen the waitress said there was 
a phone call for me, I was 
neither surprised nor interested, even 
when she said it was long-distance. 

But when I picked up the phone 
in the office and found the call was 
from Cologne, I certainly wondered. 
No senior executive of FLAG was 
likely to call me from Cologne, in 
such a hurry that the call had to be 
put through to the Red Lion. 

And when I heard Iota’s voice, 
all sorts of feelings hit me all at 
once. 

I hadn’t seen him for two years, 
not since the row. I’d been quite glad 
not to see him, naturally enough. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS

and yet I had missed him. He was 
my cousin. He had also heen, per- 
haps still was, my best friend. I was 
not entirely sure I liked him, but 
you don’t have to like your best 
friend. 

“Val,” he announced, “I’m com- 
ing back.” 

“Permanently?” I asked, without 
wild enthusiasm. 

“Hell, no. But there’s been trouble 
here.” 

“The usual trouble, I suppose.” 

“Well, apart from that, her hus- 
band’s dead. No, nothing to do with 
me, of course. But she thinks . 
anyway. I’m coming home for a 
while. Can I stay with you?” 

“As to that, Jota,” I said cautious- 
ly, stalling, “I’m not altogether . 
I mean — ” 

“Oh, that business is finished,” 
said Iota airily. “Never began, really. 
Still, maybe ... I do see your point. 
I could go to Gil instead. Not much 
^sk of trouble there.” And he 
chuckled. 

Then he said: “I suppose it’s hot 
in Shuteley too?” 

“As Hades.” 

“Anyway, it must be cooler than 
it is here. I’ll fly home. Expect me 
some time tomorrow.” 

And he hung up. 

Jota and Qil Carswell and I had 
been the Terrible Three of the Third 
at the. Grammar School. In the 
Fourth, Fifth and Sixth we remained 
inseparable, but only one of us re- 
mained Terrible. Maturity had made 
Gil morose, engulfed me in respect- 
ability, and made Jota more Terrible 
than ever, especially after he invent- 
ed sex. 



Once Jota had been Clarence Mul- 
liner, but the name was abandoned, 
unwept and unsung, from the day a 
science master dubbed him J.O.A.T.- 
A.M.O.N., for Jack of ah trades and 
master of none. For about a week 
he had been Joatamon, and then in 
the way of nicknames, convenience 
had made him Jota. 

I paid my bill, crossed the road to 
the office, and there I found a crowd 
around old Tommy Hardcastle, who 
was trying desperately to explain 
something and getting nowhere. 

“Break it up,” I said coldly. 

Nobody budged. 

“But Mr. Mathers,” said Wilma 
Shelly, “he says he saw — ” 

“I did see her,” Tommy said ea- 
gerly. “As clear as I’m seeing you, 
Mr. Mathers. She was walking along 
the street, right past the front door. 
Not six feet from me. She had a 
pink suit on — ” 

“And she didn’t have it on,” said 
Sayell, who fancied himself as a wit 
and was half right. “She was walking 
along the street in the nude with a 
pink suit on.” 

“That’s right,” said To-mmy, re- 
lieved to be understood at last, and 
the sniggers swelled. 

A tall, thin youth from the ac- 
counts department, who always 
tried to settle everything to the last 
decimal part of a penny, said: “She 
was wearing a see-through dress, 
Tommy? Lace, maybe?” 

“No, it was an ordinary pink suit, 
but sometimes it wasn’t there. I 
mean ...” He floundered on, and 
the kids chuckled, and for the time 
being I didn’t stop them. 



36 



IF 




I had seen the girl too. And I had 
thought, just for a moment, as she 
turned and glanced across the street, 
that she was wearing a pink skirt 
and giving away everything above 
her waistband free. The impression 
had been strong enough to make 
me choke. 

Of course in such a summer there 
had been some startling sartorial 
spectacles. I wouldn’t have turned a 
hair if the girl had been wearing a 
bikini, because all over, that sum- 
mer, even in Shuteley, conventional ' 
ideas about when and where to wear 
what had been tacitly dropped. Even 
policemen were allowed to wear 
shorts, and sometimes only shorts. 

But long before this remarkable 
summer, the world had decided it 
wasn’t ready for the topless dress. 
And that wasn’t all. If the girl had 
been casually strolling along the 
street in a topless dress. I’d have 
goggled my eyes but I wouldn’t have 
choked. It was the abrupt change 
before my eyes, like a piece of mont- 
age in a movie, that hit me. 

“No*w you see it, now you don’t,” 
Sayell was saying, working hard for 
more laughs. 

Although that was exactly what I 
was thinking myself, I came down 
sharply on Sayell and the rest of 
them, sending them all back to their 
desks except Tommy, who went to 
tlie door. 

“I did see her, Mr. Mathers,” 
Tommy insisted. 

“Of course you did. Tommy.” 

I went to my private office, 
thought for a moment, shrugged, and 
started work, trying not to give the 
incident too much thought. 



T he Shuteley branch of the Fire, 
Life and General Insurance 
Company — ^usually known as FLAG 
— was unique in its way. Shuteley, 
situated in the approximate middle 
of England, was a fair-sized old- 
world town, yet there was only one 
insurance office that counted. Ours. 

This was almost entirely due to 
the cunning and villainy of one Amos 
Hardy, an old rogue who died in 
1913 at the age of 108. As a young 
man, he set up his own insurance 
company in the town, with no capi- 
tal and no connections. It was said 
he had not been above fire-raising 
in the early days when insurance 
was a more adventurous business 
than it is now. After 1909 every fire 
insurance company had to deposit 
£20,000 with the Board of Trade 
before it could do business — but 
by that time, having made hay while 
the sun shone, the wily old scoun- 
drel was making the law and not 
obeying it more than he ever did. 

He got such a hold on insurance 
in the town, did old Amos, that by 
the time he died nobody for miles 
around knew that other insurance 
companies existed. Of course, his 
business was eventually taken over 
by FLAG, a big national firm, but 
Amos had done his work so well 
that even in the sixties any agent of 
any other firm trying to drum up 
business in Shuteley was wasting 
good expense money. 

That was why, in a sleepy country 
town that had more of Old England 
in it than most — we still had a vil- 
lage green with a pump, surrounded 
by timbered houses in which Queen 
Elizabeth might have slept, but had

37 




not — there was an insurance office 
the size of a young factory. 

One of the girls had to go to the 
bank, and I gave her a message for 
Gil Carswell, who worked in the 
local branch of the Midland Bank, 
merely telling him that Mr. Mulliner 
would be arriving the next day. 

She had just left the room when 
the phone rang. My calls were vetted: 
this was one I had to take. I an- 
nounced myself. 

“Sheila here,” said the phone, 
rather starkly. 

“Yes, honey?” 

“Dina has locked herself in her 
room.” 

I didn’t manage to place the crisis, 
though clearly there was one. “What 
about it?” I said. 

“Have you forgotten, Val,? The 
electrician’s here. Mr. Jerome. He 
has io get into Dina’s room.” 

“Well, tell her to come out.” 

Sheila sighed in exasperation. 
“There is now no further competi- 
tion for the silliest suggestion of the 
month.” 

“Well, I suppose you did tell her. 
Tell her again. Make her come out.” 

“Break the door down?” 

I was exasperated too. “If you 
have to.” 

“A great heavy teak door? With 
my own fair hands? Hardly, Val. Mr. 
Jerome would have to do it. And 
then — ” 

“Yes, yes, I know.” And then it 
would be all over town that Dina 
Mathers had tantrums and locked 
herself in and doors had to be burst 
open. “What did she say,” I asked, 
“when you told her to come out?” 

“She said,” Sheila said evenly. 



“that she was scared of the fairies.” 
“The what?” 

“You heard. Last night she saw 
fairies at the bottom of the garden. 
So she’s staying in her room. They 
may be good fairies, but she isn’t 
taking any chances.” 

I didn’t prolong the discussion. 
“All right,” I said. “I’ll come.” 

S heila and I got along no worse 
than most imperfect marital part- 
nerships. We might have got Mong 
a lot better — Sheila certainly 
thought so — but for Dina. 

Dina was my kid sister, tiny, sev- 
enteen, as pretty as a picture and 
sunny-tempered with everyone but 
Sheila. One reason why I cracked 
down so hard on anyone who made 
fun of Tommy Hardcastle was be- 
cause, althou^ Tommy and Dina 
couldn’t be more different in every 
other way, they had one thing in 
common . 

I slipped out as quietly as I could, 
because it never does an office any 
good when the boss goes out and 
everybody knows it isn’t on business. 
I took the car from the firm’s car 
park and drove out past the Gram- 
mar School . 

. And stopped. A hundred or 
so boys between thirteen and four- 
teen, all wearing blue shorts, filled 
the road. 

The Grammar School was four 
hundred years old. The school field 
was a hundred yards along the road, 
on the other side of it, and there was 
no changing accommodation. So the 
kids changed at the school, crossed 
the road to the field, and came back 
after sports. 



38 



IF 




The arrangement, or lack of same, 
was typical of Shuteley. 

After all the boys had crossed, I 
drove past the castle across the Old 
Bridge and turned into the track 
which led to our Queen Anne house 
about a quarter of a mile beyond 
the town boundary. The track also 
served a few farms farther on. 

Sheila, in a paint-speckled sweater 
and jeans powdered with plaster, had 
evidently been tidying up after the 
electrician. She was a slim 24-year- 
old blonde, and I had not married 
her because she was the ugliest girl 
in Shuteley. 

“All right,” she said grimly. ”You 
shift her.” 

“You didn’t . say anything, 
honey, did you?” I asked tentatively. 

She knew what I meant. “I told 
her the electrician had to work in 
her room, that’s all. And she talked 
about fairies.” 

I sighed. Dina just couldn’t see 
why I wanted Sheila around, and 
never would. What did I want with 
another girl when I had her? And 
Sheila, though she had no deficiency 
of understanding, was driven quiet- 
ly desperate by the way Dina, the 
moment my back was turned, be- 
came mulishly, deliberately obstinate 
as only a grown-up child could be. 

I didn’t see Mr. Jerome, who had 
found a job to do elsewhere in the 
house. I went up to Dina’s room, 
Sheila at my heels, and tapped on 
the door. 

“Dina, honey,” I said. 

“Val?” came Dina’s voice, sur- 
prised and slightly, but only slightly, 
apprehensive. “What are you doing 
home at this time?” 



“You have to come out, honey,*’ 
I said patiently. 

“No. I’m scared of the fairies.” 
“Fairies don’t do you any harm.” 
“How do you know?” 

“Dina, you didn’t really see any- 
thing at all, did you?” 

“I saw the fairy ring. In^the wood. 
Didn’t Sheila tell you? I’d have told 
you this morning,* only you were 
gone before I got up. I thought 
Sheila would have told you.” 

No one could be as innocent as 
Dina when she was trying to make 
trouble for Sheila. 

“Anyway,” I said, “you’ve got to 
come out.” 

A brief pause, then: “I can’t. I’m 
not dressed.” 

“Then get dressed.” 
Triumphantly: “Sheila took all my 
clothes away.” 

S heila’s eyes met mine. She didn’t 
have to tell me that any clothes 
she’d taken were to be washed. 
“Come out, Dina,” I said. 

There was silence. 

Sheila held my gaze steadily. ‘This 
is what I have to put up with all 
day and every day,” she was saying, 
without uttering a word. I didn’t say 
anything either. She knew what I 
was thinking too. What could a man 
do? There wasn’t anywhere else Dina 
could go. Our father was dead, and 
our mother . well, to give Sheila 
her due, even in our bitterest rows 
she never brought up the subject of 
Mary, who was in an institution, who 
was the reason why Dina was the 
way she was, who was the reason 
why Sheila and I had no children 
and never would have. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



39 




At last the door clicked and Dina 
came out. Exactly five feet, dark- 
haired, she had the unsophisticated 
beauty that sometimes occurs in the 
feeble-minded. She also had a highly 
provocative body that would create 
a lot of problems soon, though they 
hadn’t caused trouble yet. Not all 
men could be expected to keep their 
hands off such an attractive creature 
simply because there was a short- 
circuit in her head. 

She wore a faded cotton dress far 
too small for her, split down the 
front and unfastened at the back, 
because there was no possibility of 
getting the buttons to close. Her feet 
were bare. 

“Now listen,” I said more harshly 
than usual, “I have to get back to 
work. Will you promise, Dina, word 
of honor, to go to the summerhouse 
and stay there till I get home again?” 

“But the summerhouse is near the 
wood.” 

“Fairies only come out at night. 
You never saw fairies in the daytime, 
now, did you?” 

She frowned. It was quite true 
that she had never seen fairies in 
the daytime. 

If she gave her word she would 
keep it. She was trying to figure out 
a loophole that would enable her to 
do what she liked without exactly 
breaking a promise. If she could find 
one, she’d promise. 

“Word of honor?” I insisted. 

“Oh, all right,” she said. “Now?” 

“Now.” 

She scampered downstairs, quite 
content again already. She would be 
able to stay in the summerhouse all 
afternoon, talking to herself or play- 



ing with the dolls she had there, with- 
out any feeling that she was being 
confined, or even that she’d done 
anything to be confined for. 

On the point of telling Sheila that 
Jota was coming, I decided it would 
be wise to wait for a better moment. 
“See you, honey,” I said and leaned 
forward to peck her cheek. 

She leaned back, avoiding me. 
“Honey,” she said. “Everybody is 
‘honey.’ I’m ‘honey,’ Dina’^ ‘honey.’ 
Am I like her? Do you think of me 
like her?” 

I didn’t want to get involved in 
anything. “Bye, Sheila,” I said and 
went back to the car. 

I had just crossed the Old Bridge 
when the engine coughed and 
died. 

I cursed silently. When I had left 
the car in the lot I had known per- 
fectly well I’d have to stop at the 
filling station on my way home, and 
I would have, if I hadn’t been called 
out unexpectedly to deal with a do- 
mestic crisis. 

I was about as far from a garage 
as I could be in Shuteley. The street 
I was on was so narrow that plan- 
ning permission for garages had been 
refused, there being no room for 
cars to stop and fill up. I’d have to 
walk back to the office and phone 
a garage to pick the car up. 

I left the key in the car and started 
walking. No one would touch the 
car, not in Shuteley. Kids might, but 
the car would be picked up before 
the Grammar School came out. 

In the early afternoon, on the out- 
skirts of town, there was very little 
traffic and few pedestrians, for there 



40 



IF 




were no shops out here, and Shuteley 
was not on the main route from any- 
where important to anywhere else. 
In fact, there was nobody else in 
sight but one girl, and my eyes rested 
on her and didn’t register a thing, 
because I was thinking about Dina 
and Sheila and me and wondering 
gloomily if there was any solution to 
the age-old problem of two women 
in one house. 

I was also envying Jota, who got 
his girls on a conveniently tempor- 
ary basis (invariably stunning and 
wildly cooperative girls at that) and 
who got them in every country on 
the map, plus a few that weren’t. 

Ail in all, I was pretty sorry for 
myself. It wasn’t my fault that my 
father had married a woman who 
was already close to insanity and 
went closer. It wasn’t my fault he 
escaped the problems he had created 
by dying. It wasn’t my fault Dina 
was the way she was. It wasn’t my 
fault Sheila and I didn’t dare have 
children. 

It seemed to me that my problems, 
unlike those of everybody else, had 
been created for me and were no 
fault of mine. 

Suddenly I blinked and looked 
again at the girl coming toward me. 

Ill 

S he was not the girl in the pink 
suit. Although I had seen that girl 
only across the street and from a 
second-story window, one thing I 
was sure of was that she had blue- 
black hair. This was a near-blonde 
of about eighteen, wearing a green 
dress. Or was she? 



At the moment, beyond all doubt, 
she was. She was very tall and not 
particularly attractive — just a girl 
who would not as a rule attract a 
second glance, unless on account of 
her height. 

She came level with me, not pay- 
ing the slightest attention to me. And 
that must have been an act, because 
when a girl passes a man goggling 
at her with all three eyes, it just 
isn’t possible for her not to notice 
him at all. 

And as she passed me, it happened 
again. Not the same thing — it never 
seemed to be the same thing. This 
time, side-on, I saw palely-tanned 
flesh from ankles to armpit, unin- 
terrupted. 

When she had passed, I swung 
round, of course. However, what- 
ever I’d seen or thought I’d scjn, 
all there was to be seen now, though 
I watched her out of sight, was a 
very tall girl in an ordinary green 
dress, wearing ordinary shoes. The 
only thing that was slightly unusual 
was that I could swear she wasn’t 
wearing nylons. 

She did have, too — and this was 
the first time I noticed it — a certain 
baffling elegance, or smartness, or 
neatness. As I said, she wasn’t a 
particularly pretty girl, and though 
not fat, she didn’t have a sensational 
figure. Yet there was something 
about her that reminded me of the 
difference I had vaguely sensed when 
Sheila had pointed out to me a wom- 
an in a Paris creation and a woman 
trying hard to look as if she was in 
a Paris creation. 

Whatever it was that women 
wanted to have when they dressed 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



41 




up, this girl had it. Even if she had 
very little else to contribute. 

As I walked on, for a moment 
an old shadow darkened my mind. 
Mentally I was normal, indeed well 
above average. I’d been told after 
physical and psychiatric examinations 
that there was no trace of psychosis 
or anything in that terrifying area, 
no brain damage, no malformation. 
Yet no one with a background like 
mine could escape occasional grim 
doubts and fears. 

I dismissed the idea for a moment, 
only to find it creeping back when I 
remembered that the only other per- 
son who had seen this kind of phe- 
nomenon was Tommy. Maybe this 
was something that happened only 
to people like Tommy and Dina and 
me. 

Tommy had seen something — 
once. I had seen something — twice. 
And Dina had seen something. Fair- 
ies, she said. Or rather, a “fairy 
ring.” 

Nobody else, apparently, had seen 
anything. 

I went back to the office, called 
the Central Garage and gave in- 
structions about my car. Then I 
worked hard for all of an hour. 

When the phone rang I answered 
absently, still able to concentrate 
fairly successfully on insurance — 
for the last tiipe in weeks. 

“Val,” said Sheila, “now the elec- 
trician jhas to get into the summer- 
house.” 

“Oh, hell,” I groaned. 

I should have known. The wiring 
in our house dated back with 
the rest of the house, I strongly 



suspected, to the time of Queen 
Anne. I’d probably have let it be 
as long as it worked, but a FLAG 
executive from London, paying a 
semi-social call, happened to notice 
the wiring in the house and hinted 
strongly that it was hardly the thing 
for the local insurance manager to 
have an electrical system in his own 
house that constituted a greater fire 
risk than a moat filled with crude 
oil. So we had called in Mr^ Jerome. 

The caible out to the summerhouse 
was probably more dangerous even 
than anything in the house itself. 

Obviously Sheila had already ask- 
ed Dina to let the electrician in. In 
childish triumph, Dina saw how to 
score over Sheila after all. Dina had 
promised to stay in the summerhouse 
till I got back. So she’d keep her 
promise. Come hell or high water, 
she’d barricade herself in and stay 
where she’d promised to stay. 

“I can’t come again,” I said. 
“Can’t he come back tomorrow?” 

“He says if he doesn’t finish today 
he won’t get back for a week.” 

“Well, get her out,” I said in sud- 
den irritation. “Don’t keep calling 
me.” 

“She’s your sister.” 

“Sure, but you’re there and I’m 
here. Surely you can outsmart some- 
one like Dina?” 

“Get her out, you said?” Sheila 
retorted in a hard voice. “Okay. 
I’ll get her out. I’m bigger than she 

is, and older, and much tougher. I’ll 
get her out. And I’m going to enjoy 

it. I’m going to have the time of my 
life.” 

There was something vicious 
about the chick as she hung up. 



42 



IF 




I didn’t care. I was fed up with 
Sheila and Dina. Why couldn’t either 
of them, just once, in their different 
ways, leave me alone? Sheila was 
always with me, Dina was always 
with me. I couldn’t settle down to 
my work any morning or any after- 
noon with the slightest confidence 
that I wouldn’t suddenly be called 
upon to deal with a Sheila problem 
or a Dina problem. 

Rather wildly, I thought: why 
couldn’t Sheila and Dina fight to 
the death so that there would be 
only one of them left? I could render 
unto Sheila the things that were 
Sheila’s only if Dina didn’t interfere 
— and vice versa. 

But could I put Dina in an insti- 
tution? No. Apart from anything 
else, she was too innocently reason- 
able. Even if I wanted to do it, I 
doubted if Dina could be certified. 
She wasn’t even feeble-minded in the 
usual sense. In many ways she was 
quick and shrewd. In no way was 
she slow. She was quite a bright 
eight-year-old. Only she happened 
to have a body nine years older. 

Grimly I forced myself to work. 
But my heart wasn’t in it. 

rv 

B usiness with an agent kept me 
at the office until about seven, 
and when we were through I took 
him for a drink. Since he didn’t like 
noisy pubs we went to the the 
cocktail lounge. The Copper Beech. 

The place was empty when we 
entered. People going for a drink 
on their way home went to the pubs. 
The Copper Beech, all glass and 



chromium and plastic and inflated 
prices, catered mostly for couples 
and parties having a^night out, from 
eight o’clock onwards. 

The agent gulped his beer and 
departed, and I finished my pint of 
bitter in more leisurely fashion. I 
was downing the last drop whem a 
party of kids in their late teens came 
in, quietly for kids, 'looked around 
and marched to the back. 

They were all in shorts and 
blouses, and for a moment I thought 
they were Grammar School seniors. 
Then I saw that they were all about 
eighteen or over, too old and far too 
tall to be school kids. All the men 
were over six feet, and the girls 
not much less. 

With merely a glance at them I 
was rising to go. In Shuteley in sum- 
mer we saw hundreds of campers, 
hikers and cyclists. 

Then I saw that one of the girls 
was the girl in the green dress, and 
another, the only one who was not 
tall, had blue-black hair. 

I ordered another pint and sat 
down again. The bartender rapped 
on a partition behind him and a 
waitress in a black frock came to 
attend to the new customers. 

There were eight boys and eight 
girls. They weren’t noisy, and they 
evidently intended to keep strictly 
to themselves, for they sat together 
in a corner round one table and 
only one of them spoke to the wait- 
ress, giving the order. The others 
didn’t even talk among themselves 
until she left them. Then they started 
talking and laughing like any other 
kids, only more quietly, as if afraid 
they’d be overheard. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS

The girl I had seen wearing the 
extraordinary green dress was now 
clad like the ^others. She had not 
looked at me and perhaps wouldn’t 
have known me if she did, because 
earlier, in the afternoon, she had 
gone to a lot of trouble not to look 
at me at all. 

Now I saw that they weren’t ex- 
actly like any other group of young 
campers after all. 

I wouldn’t have noticed anything 
out of the ordinary if I hadn’t had 
a spur to my curiosity. Nobody 
else did. As it was, I saw for the 
second time a curious immaculacy 
which seemed to be common to them 
all. Every one of these kids was a 
glossy, spotless, highly-polished mo- 
del of a teenage camper. 

I thought about that and remem- 
bered where I’d seen the same kind 
of glossy unreality before. 

A pretty girl really on a jungle 
safari might conceivably spend 
most of her time in a leopard-skin 
swimsuit or a white suntop and 
shorts, though it’s unlikely. But un- 
like actresses in safari movies, she 
simply could not go on day after 
day looking as if she’d just stepped 
from her dressing-room. 

That was it. That was exactly it. 
The boys in this group had every 
hair slick In place. Their shirts were 
dazzling. There wasn’t a spot even 
on their shoes. The girls weren’t in 
the usual motley collection of loose 
sweaters, tight sweaters and rumpled 
shorts. Everything anyone wore had 
been made to measure, and there 
wasn’t a crease to be seen among 
the lot of them. 



A small thing? Certainly. A small, 
impossible thing. Did these kids have 
dressing-rooms right outside The 
Copper Beech? 

Two or three of the girls were 
pretty, and one had a one-in-a-million 
face. Out of any large group of girls 
you could pick a dozen of more or 
less uniform paettiness, attractive 
through the possession of firm young 
bodies and regular features, well- 
shaped eyebrows, small noses, soft 
mouths. But it would be a matter 
of chance if, even in a hundred 
thousand girls, you’d find one with 
both the individuality to make her 
unmistakable and unforgettable and 
the beauty to go with it. 

One girl had the kind of face that 
could launch a thousand nuclear 
submarines. 

She had blue-black hair, very 
white skin, and was probably the 
girl who for me had started it all, 
the girl in the pink suit. But I 
couldn’t be sure. Apart from her 
beauty, other things set her slightly 
apart from the rest. She was only 
about five feet four, easily the small- 
est in the group. She was pale and 
all the others were tanned. She might 
have been a little older than the 
others. She was treated with a cer- 
tain slight deference. And despite 
what I’ve been saying about them, 
she made the others look untidy. 

I sipped my beer, not inviting con- 
versation with the bartender, who 
was busy anyway. As it happened 
I’d been sitting facing the far corner 
when the kids entered and could 
therefore go on looking in their di- 
rection without showing undue cur- 
iosity.

IF 




I managed to pick up a few words. 
They were talking about “a duel.” 
A duel, they thought, would be fun. 
Some argued, said it was a crazy 
idea. 

Evidently they’d seen the plaque 
on one of the old houses round the 
green. One of the last duels in Eng- 
land had been fought on the village 
green, between the squire and a 
wealthy traveller who both fancied 
the same serving wench. Neither of 
them got her. They were both fatally 
wounded, and for thirty years or so 
(until the incident became romantic, 
quaint, something to be proud of) 
the affair was hushed up. 

There was some reference to 
“Greg”, who was not present. (So 
there were more of them) . And 
glances were cast at Snow White 
when he was mentioned, puzzling 
glances which I couldn’t fathom. 

S now White and the giants, I 
thought. Snow White is the fair- 
est in the land. She had blue-black 
hair, too. Snow White, dwarf among 
giants. 

Watching as casually as I could, 
I noticed something else. 

Nobody smoked. And nobody 
drank beer; 

It makes sense not to start smok- 
ing now that we know what we 
know. But could you get sixteen 
sensible kids all in one group? 

As for the beer question . 
quite a few of the youngsters had 
soft drinks. Others had what looked 
like cocktails: sherry, port, whiskey, 
rum. Obviously they were not tee- 
totallers. 

Out of sixteen campers, surely at 



least three or four would drink beer 
on a hot summer evening? 

I had finished my beer again. It 
was a small moment of crisis. Was 
I to walk boldly up to Snow White 
and the giants and say: ^AU is 
discovered. You are not what you 
seem,” or buy another beCT and stay 
quietly watching them?* 

I did neither. I stood up to go. 

And as I stood up, Snow White 
glanced at me and recognized me. 
I saw it in her face, althougjh the 
moment after recognition she looked 
casually around as if she’d merely 
been giving the place the once-over. 

But I knew I wasn’t mistaken. 

One thing was certain. That ex- 
pression, half startled, half inter- 
ested, had not come over her face 
simply because she had seen me in 
the upstairs window of the Red Lion. 
For one thing, I hadn’t seen her 
look up. For another, it wasn’t just 
an Fve-seen-you-before-softiewhere 
expression. 

She knew me. She hadn’t expected 
to see me, but the moment she did, 
she thought at once: Thafs Val 
Mathers . and a lot more. 

I wished I knew what the lot was. 

I’d certainly have gone over and 
spoken to her, but for the fifteen 
giants. You don’t use the “Haven’t 
we met before?” routine when the 
girl has fifteen friends with her. 

Instead, I went home. 

A s I closed the garage door after 
driving home, Dina rushed up 
to me. She was still in her Cinderella 
dress, but her arms and legs were 
swathed in bandages which she kad 
obviously put on herself. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS

“She fait me,” Dina panted. “She 
hit me and scratched me and threw 
me out.” 

“Now, Dina — ” I began. 

“Sflie got in through a window 
and pushed me and hit me and 
scratched me, pulled my hair; and I 
couldn’t stay in the summerhouse.” 

“Forget it, Dina,” I said wearily. 

“It was her fault I couldn’t keep 
my promise. She — ” 

“Dina, I’m not interested,” I said 
finmily. “You knew there was a man 
working in the house. You knew he 
had to get into your room and the 
summerhouse later. There was no 
need for any trouble if you’d done 
as you were told.” 

“I do what you tell me, don’t I? 
You told me to stay in the summer- 
house, only she wouldn’t let me.” 

At that moment Sheila came round 
the front of the house. She looked 
at me uncertainly, ready to explain, 
or fight, or refuse to say anything, 
depending on my attitude. 

“Dina,” I said, “go and get 
dressed.” 

“Aren’t you going to — ” 

“I’m not going to do anything. Go 
and get dressed. Now. And no argu- 
ment.” 

Hurt, Dina not only went but 
stayed in her room the rest of the 
evening, sulking. 

Sheila and I had an unusually 
pleasant evening on our own for 
once. I opened a bottle of Rudes- 
heimer and then a bottle of Nier- 
steiner, and we got pleasantly merry. 

At last I thought ^e circumstances 
were right and told Sheila that Jota 
was coming back to Shuleley. 

They weren’t right enough. Sheila’s 



face set hard and she said: “For 
how long?” 

“He didn’t say.” 

“He’s not staying here.” 

“No. He’s going to ask Gil — ” 
“If he visits this house. I’ll stay 
in my room till he’s gone.” 

“Sheila, he promised — ” 

"'He promised,” she said fiercely. 
She stood up and began to provd 
about, clenching and unclenching her 
hands. Sheila didn’t often hit the 
roof, but when she did she was in- 
clined to go right through it. “I 
never told you why I was so wild 
that time, Val. Not because Jota 
made a pass at me. If a man like 
him never made a pass at me. I’d 
know that I’d better take up tat- 
ting. Not even because he used your 
trust to get me in a situation where 
those horrible things could happen. 
But because when you came back, 
when you walked in on that ...” 
She had worked herself up to 
such a pitch that for the moment 
she couldn’t go on. Her color was 
high, her chest was heaving, and I 
thought it was a long time since I 
had seen her look so marvelous. 

Of course I’d never forget that 
time when I found Jota quite crudely 
trying to rape my wife. It had been 
horrible and it had been incredible. 
I’d always thought, not so much that 
Jota would never touch Sheila be- 
cause she was my wife as that if 
he did feel it coming on, he’d tell 
me. “Val, I want Sheila. I’m going 
to have her.” That was Iota’s way. 
I’d been afraid of that. 

I’d never thought for a moment 
it would happen the way it did — 
Jota, having got me out of the way

IF 




by a brazen lie, which I discovered 
only because the person I was going 
to see happened to meet me in the 
street, fighting coarsely with his best 
friend’s wife, his cousin’s wife, like 
a sex criminal. 

S heila, under control again, broke 
into my thoughts. “You were sur- 
prised, weren’t you?” she said. 

That was an understatement. “I 
couldn’t believe it,” I said. “But when 
I did, I — ’’ 

“Yes, we’re not talking about that. 
That was all right. You threw him 
about so efficiently I was quite 
cheered up. Never thought you could 
do that sort of thing, Val. I was 
proud of you then. And I didn’t 
mind seeing Jota hurt, not in the 
slightest. That bit of it was fine . 
Let’s go back a bit. You were sur- 
prised.” 

I waited uneasily, vaguely sensing 
what she was getting at. 

“You were surprised because I 
was fighting,” Sheila said. “You were 
astonished because I was 'being half 
killed and still went on resisting. You 
were certain that Jota merely had to 
cast a lustful eye on any girl, and 
she’d immediately surrender with a 
sense of profound gratitude.” 

It was true, but I couldn’t admit 
it. “I never said — ” 

“Val, I know perfectly well what 
you never said. I also know what 
you did say. Afterwards, when we 
had to talk, when we had to pretend 
to be civilized again and work out 
whether Jota was to be charged with 
assault, or what — that’s when you 
gave yourself away. All you were 
concerned with was Jota. He had to 



promise. He had to go away. He 
was the one to be convinced beyond 
a shadow of doubt that nothing re- 
motely like that must ever happen 
again. And when he accepted all 
that, you were satisfied.” 

I just looked back at her. 

“Nothing about me,” she said 
bleakly. “You couldn’t ^st me. If 
Jota tried again, next time I’d ob- 
viously leap into his arms.” 

“I never said — ” 

“Oh, Val, who cares what you 
never said? Your whole attitude 
made it a hundred per cent clear. 
Jota was the one to handle somehow. 
I didn’t matter at all. Whatever Jota 
decided was as good as done. You 
had to work on Jota. I was merely 
a pawn in the game, if that.” 

I couldn’t argue convincingly, be- 
cause she was working a vein of 
truth. No girl ever said no to Jota. 
No girl ever could. Whoever she was. 
Whatever the circumstances. And it 
was entirely correct that my surprise 
on that horrible night had been 
due largely to Sheila’s desperate re- 
sistance. I frankly couldn’t under- 
stand that. Why had a girl wlio had 
never resisted me resist Jota? 

A diversion was available. “Why 
did you wait two years to tell me 
this?” I asked. 

She sighed and sat down, crossing 
her legs. All the fire had gone out 
of her. She wasn’t going through 
the roof this time. “Some things you 
can’t take back, not ever, even if 
you want to. Two years ago, we 
might have been on the threshold of 
a great new understanding. Now we 
know we weren’t. You won’t have 
children, though I ache for them.

SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 




And Dina’s getting worse every day.” 
I was grateful to her for phrasing 
the problem of Dina like that. 
“Dina’s getting worse every day.” 
If she’d wanted to be venomous, 
there were a thousand other things 
she could have said about Dina, 
seven hundred of them not unjust. 
“Sheila,” I said, “I like you.” 

She smiled faintly. “I know. You 
couldn’t quite say ‘love,’ because 
you’re being sincere tonight. And 
I put you off your stroke earlier 
when I stopped saying ‘honey.’ You’ll 
never call me ‘'honey’ again. You’ll 
be careful, cautious, like a good in- 
surance manager, and from now on 
you’ll call Dina Dina and me Sheila.” 
There wasn’t much to say to that, 
so I went for a brief stroll. 

V 

R emembering Dina’s story about 
fairies in the wood, I walked 
down the garden, not expecting to 
see anything at all. 

The river Shute, meandering tor- 
tuously across flat country and 
through woods, half enclosed our 
house in the inner walls of a W bend. 
As far as I knew the house had 
never been flooded, though the river 
had been known to reach the gar- 
den. 

Behind our garden, in the apex 
of th6 W, was a small patch of trees 
and scrub which would have been 
very popular with courting couples, 
but for the fact that they couldn’t 
get into it. The river curved round 
it, and on the land side the only en- 
try was through our garden. And 
we had high, thick hedges. 



It was a piece of wasteland w'hioh 
was of no use to anybody. The local 
landowner had tried to sell it to us^ 
but we didn’t want it. Anyway, as 
Dina said with childish shrewdness: 
“Why buy it when it’s ours any- 
way?” 

At the fence at the bottom of the 
garden I stopped. 

Was it imagination, or was there 
a faint glow in the copse? 

It wasn’t a fire, there was no 
moon, and it could hardly be fairies 
— though I now understood Dina’s 
story. To her, what else could a 
glow in the copse at night mean 
but fairies? 

I climbed the fence and advanced 
slowly. 

The glow was very faint and would 
never have been noticed on a night 
which was not completely dark. The 
odd thing about it was it didn’t seem 
to have a source. There was nothing 
but the glow. I walked through it, 
stood in the middle of it, looked in 
all directions, and there was nothing 
but a faint blue radiance. 

I ran back to the fence, climbed 
it and hurried back to the house. 

Sheila was in the bedroom, in a 
shortie nightdress (in this extraordin- 
ary summer, most people wore less 
than that at night), about to go to 
bed. We had left a very important 
discussion hanging in the air. But 
this was something I had to share 
with somebody, and Sheila was my 
wife. 

“Sheila,” I said breathlessly, “I 
want you to come and look at some- 
thing outside.” 

“Where? Not in the garden, for 
heaven’s sake?” 



48 



IF 




“In the copse.” 

She laughed in protest. “Like 
this?” 

“It’ll cool you down. And no one 
can see.” 

On the point of protesting fmther, 
she saw I was deadly serious and 
realized it would probably be quick- 
er in the end to humor me than to 
argue with me. She put on shoes and 
we went down the garden. 

I was afraid it was going to be like 
those frustrating incidents in de- 
tective stories where the hero takes 
the cops to the murder apartment, 
only to find the 'body’s gone, the 
signs of a struggle have been re- 
moved, and even the bloodstains have 
vanished. 

However, as I helped Sheila over 
the fence she saw the glow and sud- 
denly became reluctant to go further 
because she thought there was some- 
thing instead of because she thou|ht 
there wasn’t. 

“What is it?” she whispered, mak- 
ing no move forward. 

“I don’t know. You do see it?” 

“Of course I see it. But what is 
it?” 

After a moment or two she came 
further into the copse with me, and 
together we' tried all the things I 
had already tried alone — looking 
among the branches for the source 
of the light, at the sky through the 
leaves, at the still river beyond, under 
the bushes. 

Sheila’s reaction^ was exactly the 
opposite of mine. The less I under- 
stood the glow, the more I wanted 
to find out about it. More practically, 
perhaps, Sheila satisfied herself that 

SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



49 





it was a mystery and was then quite 
prepaied to give up. 

“WeU, we’ve looked,” she said rea- 
sonalbly. “There’s nothing else to see. 
Whatever it is, it’s staying put. Let’s 
go to ibed and look in the morning.” 
And that’s what we did. I wasn’t 
sorry, though, that I’d made Sheila 
come and look. I wasn’t imagining 
things. There was a radiance in the 
wood with no source. 

Later, Sheila wanted to talk about 
something, but it wasn’t the radiance. 

“I did hurt her, Val,” she said, 
watching me. “I’m bigger than she 
is and a lot stronger. I thought, well, 
after all, she’s a naughty kid and 
she needs a lesson. I meant to beat 
her up, and I thought it was going 
to be fun, like that time when ...” 
She stopped, and although I had 
followed her thought I said nothing. 
She was thinking of that other time 
when I had thrown Iota all over the 
place, fighting mad, hardly knowing 
what I was doing; and Sheila had 
watched and been quite happy about 
it, because it was me who was doing 
the throwing and Jota who was being 
thrown, and because of what had 
happened before that. 

But Dina wasn’t quite the same. 

“It didn’t work?” I said. 

“No.” 

“I didn’t think it would.” 

“Well . don’t you mind? Was 
I terribly wrong to do what I did?” 

, “I don’t know. I don’t suppose 
so. When any kid’s on the wrong 
track you talk to him, try to per- 
suade him, and I guess if you don’t 
try giving him a good hiding you’re 
missing a bet. But you can’t beat 
sense into Dina.” 



“But you don’t mind?” Sheila in- 
sisted. 

“I don’t see that it’s anything to 
do with me,” I said. 

When we got to bed, more friend- 
ly toward each other than for a long 
time, I thought it would be a good 
idea to do something about it. But 
nothing happened, and Sheila made 
no move, merely saying “Good 
night” in a tone which seemed to 
contain finality. So a chance was 
lost, like a thousand others. 

VI 

B efore breakfast next morning I 
was back in the wood. Sheila 
didn’t come with me. She said that 
if I found anything I could tell her, 
and she’d take my word for it. 

I found absolutely nothing. The 
copse was exactly as it has always 
been, and in daylight no radiance 
could be detected. By the time it 
occurred to me to look for footprints 
or other signs that people might have 
been there recently. I’d done so much 
stamping around that the search was 
futile. Besides, hardly anything grew 
under the trees, and the thick, springy 
leaf-mold did not retain tracks well. 

When I got back, Sheila merely 
said: “It must have been some kind 
of natural phosphorescence. One egg 
or two?” 

“Phosphorescence has a source, 
like any other light,” I insisted. 

“Well, look again tonight. I won- 
der if Dina will be down in the next 
ten minutes? It’s no use calling her, 
of course.” 

Nobody at the office mentioned 
any unusual incidents of the day

IF 




before. Being the boss, I didn’t hear 
the gossip. If Sally Henry, my sec- 
retary, hadn’t be^ on holiday I 
could have asked her about the morn- 
ing’s topics. Wilma Shelly, who was 
standing in for her, was too junior 
for me to confide in her. 

I wasn’t a confident boss. I was 
efficient, of course, or I’d never have 
reached my present position. But I 
didn’t possess the sheer self-assurance 
that every good boss has to have, 
the feeling that he’s a boss by right, 
the unquestioning, unquestioned con- 
viction that things will always be 
done his way, the right way, the only 
way. 

After an hour’s correspondence, 
there was a lull, and I considered 
phoning Gil Carswell. But Gil, far 
less self-confident than me, had not 
become the boss, and I didn’t like 
to call him at the bank unless the 
matter was really urgent. That was 
why I’d sent the message the day 
before by a girl who had to go to 
the bank anyway. Gil was terrified 
of the bank manager, who had al- 
ways seemed singularly inoffensive. 
But then, Gil was terrified of every- 
body and everything. 

While I was still thinking about 
Gil, the pljone rang. Aloud I mut- 
tered: “Oh, God, not Dina again.” 

It was Iota. “I’m at London Air- 
port,” he said. “Be with you this af- 
ternoon sometime. Have you seen 
Gil since I phoned yesterday?” 

“No, but I sent him a message.” 

Iota chuckled. “Of course. Mustn't 
disturb him at the bank. The man- 
ager would chew his ears off . at 
any rate, such desperate liberties 
must never be taken. By the way. 



is anything happening in Shuteley?” 
“\^at would happen in Shute- 
ley?” I said cautiously, wondering if 
by any chance he’d heard anything. 

He hadn’t. “As you say. Silly 
question.” 

“As a matter of fact,” I^ said, 
“there is something going on. Maybe 
just a small thing, but something 
. No, don’t ask questions. Wait till 
you get here.” 

“You intrigue me. Something hap- 
pening in Shuteley seems like a con- 
tradiction in tenns. But I can wait. 
Oh . how did Sheila take the 
great news that I was coming back?” 
“Unenthusiastically,” I said. 

He chuckled again. “Don’t worry. 
I promised. If you rememiber, I 
never promised before.” 

He rang off. 

That was technically true, that he 
had never promised not to make a 
pass at Sheila. I wondered, however, 
if anyone but Jota would have con- 
sidered such a thing worth saying. 
You weren’t morally entitled to stab 
a man in the back because you’d 
never promised not to. 

A s I hung up, Wilma came in' She 
was breathless and rather in- 
dignant. “Mr. Mathers, there’s a 
young man insisting on seeing you, 
and nobody but you. He looks like 
a camper, and he’s . well, the 
things he’s been saying to the girls 

f* 

“Send him in,” I said. “Right 
away.” 

She looked surprised, but said 
nothing and went out. 

The door opened again and a 
young Goliath entered. He wore a 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



51 




white T-shirt and shorts and was 
obviously one of the giants, probably 
the biggest of them all. I judged him 
to be six feet seven. 

He had not been one of the giants 
with Snow White at The Copper 
Beech. 

“Val Mathers?” he said, advanc- 
ing with outstretched hand. “I’m 
John Smith.” 

“Really?” I said politely. 

“No, not really, if you insist. But 
it’s as fair a name as any, isn’t it?” 

“You wouldn’t by any chance be 
Greg, would you?” 

He dropped his hand. He was not 
pleased. 

“How in fisk do you know that?” 
he snarled. 

Not pressing my luck, I said: 
“Where’s your camp, Greg?” 

For a moment he simmered and 
then decided to be friends again. 

“In a bend on the river about a 
mile upstream.” 

I knew the place. It was three- 
quarters of a mile beyond my house, 
on the other side of the river, the 
north side. 

He sat down without invitation, 
looked at me expectantly and said 
nothing. 

He was blond, very good looking, 
perhaps nineteen or twenty. His ac- 
cent puzzled me a little. It was not 
foreign, his speeirh was very clear, 
and yet I had never heard anyone 
speak quite like him. I had not 
missed those two words fair and 
fisk. The natural thing to say would 
have been “as good a name as any,” 
and “fisk” seemed to be a cussword. 

There was nothing strange about 
his shirt and shorts and shoes except 



that they fitted better than clothes 
generally do and looked as if they 
had just that moment been put on, 
brand new. But for the giants that 
was nothing strange. 

He was completely at ease, and I 
was therefore puzzled by his easy 
manner and sudden silence — as if 
he expected me to tell him why he’d 
come. 

“Well, Mr. Smith?” I prompted. 
“Or Greg, as you like?” 

“I want to insure against catas- 
trophe in Shuteley during the next 
twenty-four hours,” he said coolly. 

“Catastrophe?” I asked. 

“Catastrophe.” 

“In the next twenty-four hours?” 

“In the next twenty-four hours. 
You’re remarkably up on the quick- 
take, Val.” 

There were lots of openings. I 
chose one. “You can’t do business 
under a false or incomplete name. 
John Smith won’t do. Greg won’t 
do.” 

F or a moment, for the second 
time, his eyes gleamed with a 
feral light, and I knew that this man 
was dangerous. He didn’t like to be 
balked. Despite his easy manner, he 
was liable at any moment to become 
an animal. A huge, dangerous ani- 
mal. 

I tried another opening. “We can 
always supply better rates for partic- 
ular contingencies. If you wanted to 
insure against flood, say — ” 

He grinned, all easiness and friend- 
liness again. “Flood’s unlikely, isn’t 
it? They tell me the river’s never 
been lower.” 

“Catastrophe in twenty-four hours

IF 




in Shuteley,” I said, “is unlikely. 
Another thing, Greg. You’re over 
twenty-one?” 

“What about it?” 

“If you’re not, there are difficul- 
ties.” 

“Do you sell insurance or not?” 

“I don’t sell insurance, Greg. I 
arrange it, if it seems to be to the 
mutual advantage of both parties. 
Now, let’s see — you want to insure, 
Greg? But you don’t live in Shute- 
ley.” 

“No.” 

“And — in the next twenty-four 
hours?” 

“We’re only going to be here twen- 
ty-four hours,” he said simply, “give 
or take an hour or two.” 

“What sort of sum have you in 
mind?” 

“Nothing most. A million pounds, 
maybe. Perhaps two million.” 

It was time, I thought, to restore 
sanity to the conversation. “I’m 
afraid such a transaction would hard- 
ly be practicable,” I said. “Although 
in theory insurance against any con- 
tingency is possible, such as rain on 
a certain day, failure of a crop, or 
delay in a certain delivery, there are 
always difficulties in definition, and 
it takes time to work out policy con- 
ditions. It would be quite impossible 
to draw up a policy within the time 
specified, to operate ...” 

Greg was laughing, a great roaring 
bellow of amusement that rattled the 
windows. “Val, you sound like an 
old man,” he said. 

“You’re not really serious about 
this at all, are you?” I said thought- 
fully. 

He stopped laughing at once. “No. 



It was just an idea. Quite a most idea, 
really . but as you say, hardly 
practicable. I just wondered what 
you’d say.” 

“Who is the girl,” I said abruptly, 
.“whose dress disappears?” 

Unsurprised, he answered: “All of 
them, when they wear luxont” 
“Luxon?” 

“Well, you see, the idea is . 
it’s one of those feminine paradoxes, 
arising out of the curious way wom- 
en think. If you’re wearing a dress, 
a perfectly decent dress, and bits of 
it disappear at times, that’s all right. 
Nothing indecent about it, because it 
only seems to disappear. It’s really 
there all the time.” 

“Why does nobody drink beer?” 
“We don’t like the taste. And it’s 
grossing.” 

“Grossing?” 

“Fattening.” 

“Greg, where do you come from?** 
“Here.” 

“Here? Maybe. But here isn’t 
Shuteley.” 

“Here,” he repeated blandly. 
“What’s this about a duel?” 

Again I had disconcerted and an- 
gered him. The red aninnal light 
flashed in his eyes. 

“Nothing aibout a duel,” he said 
shortly. “And what do you know 
about it, anyway? No, never mind.” 
He stood up and moved to the 
door. “Sorry you won’t do a deal, 
Val,” he said over his sihoulder, 
his composure restored. “But as you 
guessed, I didn’t really think you 
would. By the way, you know Gil 
Carswell, don’t you?” 

“Yes, but how — ” 

“And Clarence Mulliner?” 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



53 




“Yes. In fact — ” 

“In fact, he’ll arrive here at 
15 : 10 .” 

He closed the door quietly behind 
'him. 

VII 

G il called me from the bank, for 
the first time ever, and said: 
“Val, I want to see you right away. 
Come out for a drink.” 

“All right,” I said. “See you in 
The Copper Beech.” 

“That chrome-plated morgue?” 
“There won’t be anybody there.” 
“I see. Right. In five minutes.” 

I left the office at once to walk 
to The Copper Beech. 

At the door Tommy grabbed my 
lapels in his eagerness to tell me 
something. “She just passed again, 
Mr. Mathers. If you hurry you’ll 
catch up with her.” 

“Thanks, Tommy,” I said, releas- 
ed myseilf and went out into the mid- 
moming sun. 

Fifty yards ahead was the girl in 
the pink suit. Although I could see 
only her back, there was no doubt 
whatever that she was Snow White. 
Her slim, smoothly rolling hips were 
only one of the assets of a one-in- 
a-million shape to go with her one- 
in a million face; it would have been 
a crime to cover legs like hers with 
the sheerest nylons. 

One small surprise: I wouldn’t 
have expected such a girl to wear the 
same outfit two days running. 

Since she was alone this time. I’d 
have hurried after her and stopped 
her. But it wasn’t necessary. Glanc- 
ing over her shoulder she saw me 



and, making no pretense that she 
didn’t know me from Adam, stopped 
and leaned against a lamp standard 
to wait for me. 

As I approached, her shoulders 
were sudde^y bare. This time I saw 
more clearly what happened, when 
it happened. Out of the corner of 
my eye I still saw the lower part of 
her jacket and her skirt. It was as 
if my gaze had burned a hole in her 
clothes. 

There were a few people in the 
street, and some of them were star- 
ing. For the most part, however, 
they seemed to be pretending that 
they hadn’t noticed anything. (This 
was Shuteley). 

When I was ten feet away Snow 
White’s jacket was complete again, 
but her skirt was abbreviated to 
playsuit length. Then she wore the 
whole suit again except for a large 
circular cut-out round her navel. 

Cut-out wasn’t quite the right 
word. Material and flesh merged in- 
to each other like candlelight and 
shadows. 

More than her blue-black hair had 
made me think of her as Snow White. 
Her flesh all over — and by this 
time I’d seen quite a lot of it, in 
aggregate — was pale and creamy, 
and in this summer that was a rare 
achievement. None of Ihe giants was 
pale. Every one of them was tanned, 
some lightly, some quite heavily. 

She was with the giants but not 
of them. 

I stopped. “Hello,” I said. 

She smiled. 

“I’m Val Mathers,” I said, “as I 
suspect you know very well.” 

I scored a point with this. Her 



54 



IF 




eyes widened, and she asked : “What 
makes you say that?” 

“You recognized me in the bar 
last night.” 

She nodded, admitting it. But she 
added nothing, admitting no more. 
“Who are you?” I asked. 
“Miranda.” 

“Just Miranda?” 

Her suit, oddly enough, was not 
changing any more. Perhaps what 
one saw depended on the angle of 
vision. Moved by a spirit of experi- 
ment, I stretched out my hand to 
touch her waist . 

S he struck my hand hard, though 
without malice. “Wait for an 
invitation,” she said coolly and 
turned and walked away, to my dis- 
appointment. I had expected more 
from the encounter. 

From the back, like the other girl, 
she wore perfectly normal clothes. 

I found Gil in The Copper Beech. 
Although the lounge was not as emp- 
ty as it had been the previous eve- 
ning, only half a dozen people were 
there. 

We sat in the corner where the 
campers had sat the evening before, 
and we had it to ourselves. 

Gil and I were the same height and 
weight and at one time had resem- 
bled one another. Now he had thick 
glasses and a permanent leave-me- 
alone frown, and I hoped I didn’t 
look remotely like him. 

Gil could have done anything. That 
is, he had the theoretical ability to 
do almost anything. In practice he 
had achieved nothing and never 
would. 

Being sensitive myself, I under- 



stood him better than anyone else 
except possibly Barbara. But nobody 
could do anything for ihim. He 
couldn’t do anything for himself. 

The slightest criticism, the merest 
breath of condemnation, even meant 
as a jest, deeply wounded him. He 
was a bleeder. Scratch him, and he 
bled for days. If he made a genuine 
mistake, it took him a month to re- 
cover from it. But it didn’t even have 
to be genuine. Someone merely ha;! 
to hint that something, anything he’d 
done was a stupid thing to do, and 
he’d start to bleed slowly, silently. 

Of course he defended himself. He 
spent his life and all his vast poten- 
tial defending himself against attack, 
when he wasn’t being attacked. 

I was nearly as sorry for him as 
for myself. What was the use of be- 
ing a near-genius when a casual re- 
mark by an officeboy could mean a 
month of misery for you? 

Gil had married Barbara, another 
moody genius, who sketched and 
sculptured and wrote poetry and flat- 
ly refused ever to go further than 
five mil^ from the village green. She 
had roots, apparently. 

“What do you know, Val?” Gil 
asked abruptly, when the waitress 
had brought our beers. “What do 
you think is going on?” 

I took out a penny. “Let’s toss 
for first innings,” I said. Gil lost, 
and I put him in first. 

“A gang of kids has been hang- 
ing round the house,” he said. “They 
seem very interested in Garry.” 
Garry was Gil’s two-year-old son. 
He was an only child and was going 
to remain so for two excellent rea- 
sons. Barbara couldn’t have any 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



55 




more children, and neither — as he 
had told me one morosely drunken 
night when we were both feeling sor- 
ry for ourselves — could Gil. 

“Can I have Dina?” he asked. 
“She’d be company for Barbara.” 

So that was it. “Iota’s coming,” 
I reminded him. “And he wants to 
stay with you.” 

“With us?” Gil was astonished. 
“You’ve got a great big house. We 
only have — ” 

He stopped. 

T hey had an outside lavatory. The 
wooden stairs up to their flat 
were so worn that they looked as 
if they’d been carved curved. The 
floors creaked and were uneven. 

When houses had been revalued 
a year or two back, nearly every- 
body’s valuation, including ours, was 
doubled, at least. Gil’s had been 
halved. Human beings weren’t sup- 
posed to live in such conditions any 
more. 

Although as a bank clerk Gil 
didn’t make a great deal of money, 
others in his position, married with 
one child, managed to live far more 
comfortably. But neither Gil nor 
Barbara was remotely practical. They 
bought things they thought they 
needed, but didn’t. They didn’t buy 
things they did need. 

“We can manage, I suppose,” he 
said stiffly. 

“You^still want Dina?” 

“Yes. I have to go to work, and 
Barbara’s nervous.” 

“Dina won’t be much help.” 

Gil shrugged impatiently. He was 
always impatient when anyone didn’t 
instantly understand him, even 



though he had not supplied all the 
essential information. 

“I don’t think they mean any 
harm, the kids. Maybe they won’t 
even come back. It’s just that Bar- 
bara’s alone in the house all day. I 
thought of Dina since she doesn’t go 
out much. And if Iota’s there ...” 

He let that hang, and I didn’t take 
it off the hook. As far as we knew 
Iota had only once broken trust 
with either of us in that particular 
way. Gil knew what had happened 
— Sheila had said something to Bar- 
bara. The idea of Iota making a 
pass at Barbara seemed fantastic to 
me, but it probably didn’t seem so 
fantastic to Gil. 

“All right,” I said. “Til ask her.” 

Rather surprisingly, Dina got on 
quite well with both Gil and Bar- 
bara. Moody geniuses don’t like com- 
petition or criticism, and Dina never 
gave them any. 

We said no more about Iota. Bar- 
bara would cling to Dina, and away 
from me, away from Sheila (whom 
she really trusted in a peculiar way) 
Dina would stick to the one person 
she knew. 

“There’s something else about 
those kids,” Gil said. “They came 
into the bank and changed some 
money. Silver into notes. I was the 
only one to notice a certain very 
strange thing, and for some reason 
I didn’t point it out to anyone else.” 

Gil felt in his pocket and produc- 
ed two half-crowns, two florins, two 
shillings. He made no comment, so 
I examined them. 

It wasn’t hard to get the point. 
The half-crowns were both fairly 
shiny, dated 1961. The florins were 



56 



IF 




old and worn, dated 1935. The shill- 
ings were dated 1952. 

“I see what you mean,” I said. 

“Do you?” He sounded skeptical. 
Gil, with his inflated IQ, could never 
believe that anyone else had more 
capacity for putting two and two 
together than . well, Dina. 

I looked more closely. One half- 
crown had an infinitesimal scratch 
across the Queen’s hair. So had the 
other. The milling on the florins was 
identical, particularly worn just be- 
low the date. 

“There were a lot more of these?” 

“Yes.” 

“Any notes?” I asked. 

“No. Well?” 

He was challenging me to reach 
his own conclusion. 

I said: “I know why you didn’t 
point this out.” 

“Do you?” 

“They must be forgeries, of course. 
Forgeries so good they’d be hard to 
detect and won’t ever be detected 
now that they’re mixed with other 
coins and the duplication isn’t sig- 
nificant. Notes weren’t forged, or 
duplicated, because the numbers 
would eventually give them away.” 
Gil nodded with reluctant respect. 
“And Why didn’t I point it out?” 
“Because you’re responsible. This 
might mean trouble. If you let it 
go, it can’t possibly mean trouble.” 
“Clever,” he sneered. “Now tell 
me why it was done.” 

“They needed money, so they 
made it,” I said. 

He sniffed, but didn’t pursue the 
topic. Instead, he said: ‘Tell me 
what you know.” 



I told him. I came last to the brief 
encounter with Miranda. 

His eyes gleamed. 

“The ultimate in provocation,” he 
said. 

“What do you mean?” 

“Could it be simpler? The impact 
of any outfit any girl wears lasts 
about five minutes. After she’s taken 
off her jacket and you see the lowest 
low-cut neckline you ever saw, 
after you’ve had a good look, she 
might as well put the jacket on.” 

I must have looked unimpressed, 
for he went on in a torrent of words 
to develop the theme. 

“Does anybody stare at the Gram- 
mar School senior girls in their little 
white pants, except wistful old men? 
But let them put on skirts and ride 
bicycles in a breeze ... A pretty 
girl peels to a bikini, and every man 
on the beach stares. For a while. 
Then she puts on a beach wrap, 
leaves it unfastened, and they stare 
again every time it falls open.” 

“I never thought of that,” I said. 
He gaj>ed at me. “You never 
thought of it? Ten minutes after 
viewing the delectable Miranda 
you’ve just been describing?” 

“I was too busy doubting my own 
sanity. But I see what you mean 
now.” 

And I did. Successful strippers 
don’t just take their clothes off. TTiey 
tantalize. And what could be more 
tantalizing than a luxon dress? What 
greater inducement to look could 
there be than not knowing what 
you’re liable to see? 

Gil had hit on a good phrase — 
the ultimate in provocation. 

Current fashion wasn’t anywhere 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



57 




near the ultimate in provocation. In- 
deed, with untidy, too-Iong hair, 
tight jeans and loose sweaters, long 
point^ flat shoes, unnatural makeup 
and too-short skirts on the wrong 
gMs, teenage glamor had never hit 
a lower low. 

This kind of thing was nothing 
remotely like current fashion. 

“Where are they from?” I mur- 
mured. “Outer space?” 

The complete absence of reaction 
showed that I was not expressing 
any idea completely new to Gil. And 
he was the most confirmed skeptic 
in Shuteley . 

vm 

I had meant to go home for lunch 
and ask Dina if she’d like to go 
and stay with the Carswells for a 
while, but I hadn’t phoned Sheila to 
warn her, and it was just as well. 

As I left the office, Miranda fell 
into step with me and asked: “Care 
to buy me lunch?” 

It was a question that needed no 
answer. 

I took her to the Red Lion, partly 
through lack of choice and partly 
because the idea of sitting opposite 
her in a stall all to ourselves was 
anything but unattractive. 

She was not wearing the pink suit. 
She wore a silvery gray dress that 
didn’t disappear,* and she was still 
sensational. 

She must, if the camp was the 
giants’ only base, have gone straight 
there and come straight back. 

As we sat down, I said: “I 
waited.” 

“For what?” 



“An invitation.” 

She smiled a faint smile and said: 
“This is a different kind of invita- 
tion.” 

“What are you going to tell me, 
Miranda?” I asked. 

“Why are you so sure I’m going 
to tell you anything?” 

“Because the only reasons you 
could have for 'being here with me 
now are to tell me something or ask 
me something. And I have a feel- 
ing that I couldn’t tell you much you 
don’t know.” 

“There could be another.” 

“Such as?” 

“Interest in you. I might be curi- 
ous what you’re like. Anyway — 
what would you like to know?” 

“Where do you and your friends 
come from?” 

“Here,” she said, as Greg had 
done. 

The waitress interrupted us then, 
and when she left with our order 
Miranda moved back a square. 

“I’ll tell you one reason why I 
wanted to lunch with you, if you 
like.” 

“Why?” 

“I want you to introduce me to 
Iota.” 

I might have guessed. In this 
crazy business, one thing could be 
expected to be unchanged — that 
Snow White would instantly be 
drawn to the prince. 

“What do you know about Iota?” 
I said. 

She merely smiled and shrugged. 

“Greg called him Clarence Mulli- 
ner,” I observed. 

sat up quickly. “Greg? When 
were you talildng to Greg?” 



58 



IF 




“This morning. He came to see 
me.” 

She was angry, I saw, and perhaps 
afraid. It was an excellent chance, 
and I hoped I’d be able to take it. 
The possibility that I might be able 
to play Snow White against Giant 
No. 1 had not until that moment 
occurred to me. 

The less I said, and the more Mir- 
anda said, the better. 

“What did he want?” she asked 
sharply. 

“Amusement, I suppose. He want- 
ed to insure against catastrophe here 
in Shuteley in the next twenty-four 
hours.” 

“The vandal,” she breathed. 

“Vandal?” That was interesting. It 
hadn’t occurred to me that Greg 
might be trying to insure against 
disaster and then cause it. 

“You wouldn’t understand.” .. 

“Of course not. I understand very 
little.” 

“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be 
rude.” 

And then, with a baffling switch 
that took the wind out of my sails, 
she smiled and said: “It doesn’t mat- 
ter anyway. Greg’s a fool, a danger- 
ous, megalomaniac, irresponsible 
fool . but it doesn’t matter.” 

Rallying, I said: “Why not? Be- 
cause we don’t matter? Because we 
don’t live in the same country as 
you? The same world? The same 
dimension? The same time?” 

M ost inopportunely, the waitress 
brought our soup (brown Wind- 
sor, of course). 

When she had gone, I asked : 
“How old are you, Miranda?” 



I got the smile again, and nothing 
else. 

Possibly, I thought she was many, 
many years older than she looked. 
This close, I had an opportunity to 
see that the flawlessness common to 
all the young strangers was absolute. 
I don’t mean that they were all hand-" 
some or beautiful. But like Miranda, 
they had no hair out of place, no 
scars, no scratches, perfect teeth, 
perfectly manicured hands. In the 
heat of a summer day, she didn’t 
sweat. She appeared to have no 
makeup on, yet I was sure she had. 
Right through history, women had 
gilded the lily. Even in a different 
history, I was sure they would do 
the same. 

I asked her: “Are you wearing 
makeup?” 

“Yes.” 

Her gray dress was at the same 
time unremarkable and scarcely pos- 
sible. No creases or marks. Its fit 
was several degrees beyond current- 
ly known perfection. 

Ordinary dresses worn by ordin- 
ary girls weren’t like Miranda’s. 
Either the machinery showed, or the 
absence of machinery. 

“You can’t,” I said thoughtfully, 
“be wearing a bra.” 

“No.” 

“Then how . ?” Well, romantic 
myth aside, women needed some- 
thing to provide their shape. 

“Selective tension,” she said easily. 
“Different degrees of elasticity in 
different places.” 

And at sight of my expression, she 
laughed for the first time. 

She stopped when I said: “You 
do come from the future.”

Then we’ll talk about something else. 
We come from the present, and we

“Yet you say ‘come,’” I answered 
quickly. 

A flicker in her eyes registered 
appreciation of the point. Since she 
dto’t reply, I pursued: “Another 
dimension then?” 

“Dimension?” she said. “What’s 
that?” 

I tried to* convey my own rather 
fuzzy idea of the theory of co-exis- 
tent worlds. She seemed interested. 

“This is only a theory?” she asked. 
“Tliere’s no proof?” 

“None. But you might know 
whedier it’s more than a theory, I 
think.”

she said finnly, ‘Ve’H talk about 
you.” After a pause she added; “And 
Jota.” 

“No,” I said. Although I’d had 
my chance, and lost it, I might get 
it back. “We’ll talk about Greg. 
And you.” 

I had lost it. She had regained her 
control. She wasn’t going to ask what 
had happened between Greg and me. 



She wouldn’t discuss it. 



So I told her about Jota and Gil 
and me. Every time I tried to turn 
the conversation back to her and the 
giants, she promptly turned it back. 
I told her briefly about Sheila, but 
not about Dina or Mary. 

Only three times, briefly, did the 
talk swerve from the path along 
which Miranda was casually driving 
it. 

The first time, after telling her 




SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 








about the days when Jota, Gil and I 
were the Terrible Three, I asked 
what she and her friends called them- 
selves. She thought for a minute and 
then said: “W^, what would you 
ca!! us? Any ideas?” 

“Snow ^Wte and the giants.” 

She stared and laughed rather un- 
certainly. She thought she ought to 
know what I was talking about, but 
didn’t. She was off balance, so I 
said: 

“Greg said ‘as fair as any,’ instead 
of ‘as good as any.’ He said ‘how 
in fisk’ . ?” 

Miranda jumped, nearly spilling 
gravy over herself. 

“I presumed,” I said casually, 
“that meant something like how in 
hell.’ ” 

“It means rather more than that,” 
said Miranda. “There are sexual con- 
notations.” 

“I’m not surprised. He said ‘up 
on the quicktake.’ ” 

Miranda was silent. 

CCA simple mistake,” I went on, 
“if you read a phrase in a 
book. Quick on the uptake. Up on 
the quicktake. Unimportant . ex- 
cept that nobody born between 1860 
and 1960 could say such a thing. 
Then there was ‘most,’ apparently a 
term of general approbation. ‘Gross- 
ing,’ meaning fattening. I may have 
missed a few.” 

“Greg is careless,” said Miranda. 
“Very careless.” 

“And you’re not, I noticed. Ex- 
cept in wearing, a luxon suit.” 

“I won’t do it again.” 

“Pity.” 

The second time was when the 



sweet came up. I asked about the 
food, and she said, in slight surprise: 
“It’s only food,” and though she 
instantly turned the conversation 
again, I was left with another strange 
impression: Miranda and the giants 
ate and drank as we stoked a fire 
or filled an oil heater. It had to be 
done, but the quality of the fuel, so 
long as it came up to certain mini- 
mum standards, was immaterial. 

The last time was when we left. 
As she stood up I noticed something 
I’d have seen before if I’d ‘been rea- 
sonably observant. She carried no 
handbag, and she had no pockets. 

“Where do you carry things?” I 

“What things?” 

“Money, cosmetics, a handker- 
chief, keys — that sort of thing.” 

‘*\^y would I need them?” she 
asked mildly. 

We had emerged into bright sun- 
light. It was as hot as usual. 

“Thanks for the lunch, Val,” Mir- 
anda said. “I’ll see you later.” 

And she strode off so abruptly 
that even to attempt to detain her 
I’d have had to shout or run after 
her. 

From the way she walked, I knew 
she could run faster than I could. 

Looking after her, I decided that 
Miranda, in her way, was as careless 
as she thought Greg was. True, it 
was a different way. 

We had lunched together, a man 
and girl. And we might have been 
robots. 

Certainly some apparently person- 
al things had been said. I’d said a 
lot. I had acted more or less like a 
human being.

Everything she had said and done

4 4'\7'ou don’t really believe it, do 
I you?” Gil sneered. A sneer 
was the only way to describe it. 
Where anyone else would have ex- 
pressed polite surprise, Gil’s reaction 
was incredulity that anyone could 
be so stupid, even you. 

“I do,” I said. 

“You mean one of these — giants 
tells you Jota will arrive at 3:10, 
amd you expect him on the dot?” 

I looked at my watch. It was eight 
after three. 

“You can believe what you like, 
Gil,” I said. “But these giants are 
no ordinary kids. I’ve been trying to 
figure out how Miranda was able 
to make me talk like that an hour 
or so ago, without ever letting, the 
conversation get more than two or 
three degrees above absolute zero, 
and now I see it. She knew the ques- 
tions to ask.” 

Gil started to say something, but 
I hadn’t finished. “Maybe Greg 
meant Jota would arrive in Shuteley 
at 3:10 exactly, he didn’t say. But 
I think he meant here. I think he 
meant that wherever I was, whether 
I went home or stayed in the Red 
Lion or came back here, Jota would 
walk in at 3:10.” 

“Of all the fatuous, ridiculous, 
superstitious — ” Gil began. 

He’d probably have found quite 
a few more adjectives before he had 



to cap them with a noun. But just 
then the door opened. 

I’d given instructions for anyone 
who called on me after three to be 
sent straight in. That was why Mir- 
anda found it so easy. 

“Why look surprised?” she said. 
“I told you I wanted you to intro-^ 
duce me to Jota.” 

“I’m surprised,” I observed, “that 
you should consider an introduction 
necessary. You didn’t with me.” 

She smiled and turned to Gil. 
“Hello, Gil,” she said. “Has Garry’s 
flush gone yet?” 

A lthough Gil didn’t answer, I 
could see he was startled. Garry 
evidently had had a flush, and it 
wouldn’t have surprised me to learn 
that there was no apparent way for 
the giants to know about it. 

Miranda sat down, primly arrang- 
ing her skirt the way girls do (though 
I suspected she had had to practice). 
And the very instant that she turned 
and looked at the door, Jota came in. 

He had never been handsome. I 
never knew any ladykiller who was 
really good-looking. Women seem to 
go for men of the oddest shapes and 
sizes. Jota had a long nose, very 
deep-set eyes, hollow cheeks and 
black hair nearly, but not quite, as 
dark as Miranda’s. He was tall and 
very thin. He looked like a fanatic 
or visionary, and this impression 
wasn’t wrong, though fanaticism was 
only part of his complex make-up. 

He didn’t look at Gil or me. He 
went straight to Miranda, took her 
hand gendy and pulled her to her 
feet and said, from his nine-inch ad- 
advantage: “You’re exquisite.” 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



63 




“I know,” said Miranda coolly. 
“But thanks for noticing.” 

“Your name must be Venus.” 

“If you say so,” said Miranda. 
There was a lot more of this, and 
I realized as I watched that Iota, for 
only the second time, was annoying 
me far more than Gil ever could. 

It’s strange about old friends, peo- 
ple you know from way back. You’ve 
forgotten long ago whether you like 
them or not. The question has 
ceased to be relevant. 

Gil, now. He had not made a 
friend in the last fifteen years. He 
would die without making another 
friend. He had become an amalgam 
of armor and anger and acid and 
antagonism, a fortress on an island 
that no army would ever want to 
storm. On the mainland, they’d 
march past the defenses against noth- 
ing with scarcely a derisive smile. 

Only Iota and I (and Barbara, in 
a different but not warmer way) 
would ever put up with Gil. 

Iota ... I had admired and en- 
vied him. He had done and was still 
doing many things I wished I could 
do, and his amatory success was the 
least of these. He was, after all, a 
Jack-of-all-trades (even if master of 
none). There was nothing he couldn’t 
turn his hand to. He had the courage 
or selfishness or brute insensitiveness 
to do what he liked and invariably 
get away with it. Most people treat 
you as your own attitude and expec- 
tation invites them to treat you. And 
Iota got what he wanted — whatever 
it was. Always. Everywhere. 

I had had every right to objeci 
when Iota’s roving eye lighted on 
Sheila. I had no right to object when 



Miranda caught his eye, but I did. 

Surprisingly, the meeting was 
brought to order by Miranda. She 
suddenly said: “I must be going,” 
and walked out as abruptly as she 
had left me outside the Red Lion. 

Ci'T^hat girl,” said Iota, “fills me 
A with a quite irresistible de- 
sire to see that dark head on a white 
pillow. It will not be resisted. Now — 
what’s going on?” 

He hadn’t changed. He had never, 
I suspected, been in love; he bad a 
completely mistaken idea of what 
love was. Stumbling and imperfect 
as our connubial relations were, I 
believed that both Gil and I knew 
far more about love than Iota would 
have learned by the time he died. 

He heard our side of the story 
first. He wanted it that way, and 
things were generally done Iota’s 
way. 

Gil had nothing fresh to say. The 
giants had not been near his house 
again. I glossed over the fact that 
I had not yet asked Dina to go and 
stay with the Carswells. 

In my turn I told them all the 
facts, but not all my guesses. 

Then Iota said; “All right, let’s 
call on the giants. We’ll go to the 
camp.” 

Gil was reluctant. He didn’t say 
he was afraid to go. He argued 
against the idea in general. But when 
Iota and I decided to go without 
him, Gil stoppled arguing and seemed 
to think it might be a good idea. 

So Iota and I went to look at the 
giant’s base. 

It did not occur to me that one 
of us would die there.

HANDY PHRASE-BOOK 
IN FANNISH 

by LIN CARTER 



Here's how to talk like a 
fan — and even understand 
some of what you're saying! 



The Fannish Lingo 

I suppose every in-group has or 
will develop its own slang, given 
sufficient time. This is true of every 
group from the various scientific 
discipline (each having a slang 
vocafbulaiy called “technicalese”) 
and such game-worlds as Big Time 
Chess (forever blathering on with 
such terms as “Gumphogle’s Third 
Gambit” and the like) . right 
on down to enthusiasts of mystery 
fiction (called ’tec fiction by in- 
siders who sling around baffling 
phrases like “procedural novel” and 
roman policiere) and to us science- 
fiction fans. 

In the forty years or more that 



the science-fiction magazines have 
been with us, we have evolved, 
coined, borrowed and stolen a size- 
able vocabulary of terms, words and 
nicknames totally cryptic and enig- 
matic to The General Public. It 
all started with Hugo Gemshack, 
the man who founded the first 
science-fiction magazine. Amazing 
Stories, We call the stuff we read 
“science fiction” because he coined 
the term. He also coined a variant, 
“scieoitifiction.” And away we go! 

Now, to avoid the sheer nerve- 
fatigue of putting down those same 
old fourteen letters every five min- 
utes, it became necessary to coin 
nicknames for our favorite reading 
material. Like sf. Or SF. Or s-f, s.f.. 



65 




S.F., S-F, and so on {Time maga- 
2dne came up with a repellent neo- 
logism of their own a decade back, 
'-when The Great SF Boom began. 
They called it “sci-fi” — is noth- 
ing sacred?) And than, consider 
scientifiction. That got trimmed 
down to stf. In conversation, pro- 
nounced “stef” — and sometimes 
spelled that way. 

Now, suppose you want to ap- 
ply the term as an adjective. You 
just can’t say, “I saw a real science- 
fictional movie last night, gang!” 
What you say is “stefnal” ... or 
“stefish.” 

One Thing Leads to Another 

Now, by extrapolating from this 
not-very inspired word, we came 
up with: “stefnist” (one who is a 
fan, but thinks the term Lacks Dig- 
nity); “stefnistic” (something that 
relates to science fiction, i.e., “That 
new eye-makeup makes you look 
real stefnistic, toots!” . and 
(again) so on. 

“Fan” is a more popular term 
than stefnist anyday. The plural 
is fen. A female fan (oh, yes, there 
are such) is generally a fanne. Any- 
thing you could call fannish (like 
an activity such as puiblishing a fan 
magazine) you can also call fenly 
— or, fennish. Fan magazines them- 
selves are called fanzines (the word 
was coined by Louis Russell Chauv- 
enet) or fanmags — and the plural 
is “fmz”, but don’t ask me how 
you pronounce it, because you don’t. 

Compounded words, as you can 
see, compose a major-size chunk of 
the fannish lingo. The editor of a 



fan magazine is a “faned.” If you 
belong to F.A.P.A. (Fantasy Ama- 
teur Press Association) you pub- 
lish a fapazine, and you are a fapan. 
If your fanzine lasts a year (many 
don’t) you put out a particularly 
large Anniversary Issue called “the 
Annish.” If your “fanac” (activities 
in science-fiction fandom) are con- 
fined largely to reading fanzines and 
submitting LoC’s (letters of com- 
ment), you are likely to be sneered 
at as a “letterhack.” If your fanac 
is big time stuff and you become a 
celebrity, you are a BNF (Big Name 
Fan); and if your output is con- 
sidered “crifanac” {critical, or real- 
ly important fanac) you will be 
mentioned all over the place and col- 
lect lots of “egoboo” (ego-boosting. 
For when someone mentions your 
name in print doesn’t it boost your 
ego?). 

But let’s suppose your fan acti- 
vities are confined to writing scho- 
larly treatises on the Sources Used 
by H.P. Lovecraft in creating his 
Cthulhu Mythos, or deadly-serious 
lit-ry criticism of the latest Ace 
paperbacks, or dull articles on fan- 
nisih history (such as Our Man In 
Fandom does not write). In this 
case, you may very well be dis- 
missed as an eggheady old Sercon 
(serious, constructive fan). The 
other end of the spectrum from this 
is the noisy teen-aged fan with the 
helicopter beanie and collection of 
BNF autographs. He’s called a 
faaan. 

Or suppose you chance to belong 
to a very large, very old organiza- 
tion called The National Fantasy 
Fan Federation. The name itself has 



66 



IF 




been abbreviaited down to “the 
NFFF” or “the N3F.” You are re- 
ferred to as a Neffer. If you pub- 
lish a fanmag distributed to mem- 
bers only, it’s a Neffzine. 

Slans and the Star-Begotten 

The key word, fan, came in for 
plenty of usage. Many fanzines 
punned with it, coming up with titles 
like FUNTASY (a fanzine of hum- 
orous fantasy, now defunct), FAN 
FARE, FANEWS and like that. 
Fans .have always been able to identi- 
fy with the eternally put-down mu- 
tant supermen in stories like Staple- 
don’s Odd John, A. E. Van Vogt’s 
Sian, and H. G. Wells’s The Star- 
Begotten. The tremendous populari- 
ty of Sian, coupled with its fortui- 
tous resemblance to the word “fan”, 
produced a host of variations. Tliere 
was a fanzine called Slantasy, for 
instance, and constructions like 
“slanzine” and “Slandom” became 
popular. 

Along with this We-Are-All-Mut- 
ant-Supermen notion, fans adopted 
the synthetic language, Esperanto. 
Fans went through a period of using 
nicknames which were their names 
rendered into Esp>eranto. For ex- 
ample, Morojo (Los Angeles fanne. 
Myrtle R. Douglas): Alojo (Arthur 
Louis Joquel IT); Gakspiro (Jack 
Speer). One of the leading propon- 
ents of Esperanto in Fandom was 
Los Angeles suiperfan of yore, For- 
rest J. Ackerman, today editor of 
a couple of those movie monster 
magazines. Famous Monsters of 
Filmland and Monster World. Oddly 
enough, Ackerman didn’t use an Es- 



per antic version of his name dur- 
ing his fanac days. But he did use 
nicknames aplenty: 4e (pronounced 
,Forry”); 4SJ ( “Forr-est-J ) ; Ef- 
jay; and many more. 

Ackerman founded several nutty 
fannish innovations. Such as “Ack- 
ese”, a sort of simplifipd spelling or 
typing or whatever you’d like to 
call it. A sample would read some- 
thing like this: “U & I r 2 b praps 
th 1st 2 men 2 r@ch n xtra glaktik 
planet.” (Translation: “You and I 
are to be perhaps the first two men 
to reach an extra-galactic planet.”) 

Ackerman 

also pioneered something called non- 
stoparagrafing. You can see wihat it 
is — instead of pulling the carriage 
back to the traditional five-spaces-in- 
from -left-margin, you just drop 
down from the end of the last 
paragraph — wherever it happens 
to come in the line — to start the 
new one. 

E. Everett Evans followed the Ac- 
kerman-style of nicknames. He was 
called 3E, or sometimes ‘Tripoli”. 
Joe J. Fortier did the same — 2J4. 
Then there was DW3 — compo- 
site nickname for Don Wollheim, 
Dirk Wylie and Dick Wilson — 
three fans whose initials were the 
same, and w<ho roomed together in 
the Ivory Tower. 

You Can't Be a BNF 

Without a Nickname 

The weird world of fan nick- 
names is a never-ending source of 
amusement to me. I can remember 
Ecco (E. C. Oonner), and Elarcy 
(Louis Russell Chauvenet — “L. 



PHRASE-BOOK IN FANNISH 



67 




R. C.”), and SaM (Sam Moskowitz, 
so spelled to avoid that superfluous 
and ilfae popular lettediaek 
in the prozmes, JoKe (Joe Kennedy, 
once a •witty Ian humoiifit and now 
a Goftege pcofcssor in literature, and 
a prize-winning minor American 
poet); and, although modesty for- 
bids, LinC (pronounced “link” and 
short for Your Man in Fandom, Lhi 
Carter) . 

Then there was “Ephless El” — a 
phan named Elmer Purdue, whose 
typewriter, when he entered phan- 
dom, lacked the “F” key; no phault 
of his, it phoreed him to write like 
this due to the missingness of this 
letter. 

And a chap out in Bloomington, 
Indiana, who now writes hardcover 
mystery novels under his real name, 
Wilson Tucker, when a fan 
adopted the first name “Bob” — 
which naturally laid him wide-open 
for such terms as “Boob” Tucker, 
et al. And a fan of the ’60’s here in 
New York, Bob Stewart, who dis- 
torts bis first cognomen to “Bhob.” 
And Fred Pohl, the editor of this 
magazine, who used to sign his let- 
ters wkh a Greek phi. 

Fttnzina Slong 

In the world of fanzines, we’ve 
evolved and coined a curious group 
of in-joke terms. For example, 
Obliterine. This is the correction 
fluid us^ to mend a tear or blank 
out a mistake made in typing up a 
mimeograph stendl. Fans used this 
stenchful hlue fluid so liberally that 
one once composed a verse in its 
honor: 



Obliterine, obliterine. 

Without you where would we 
have been? 

To err is human, and shnnish 
too, 

But we can correct our mis- 
takes with you! 

And there’s a form of nonsensical 
verse called Beardmuttering (“k’s the 
kind of surrealistic stuff you mutter 
in your beard”). Since I couldn’t 
possibly describe it — except to say 
that, for some very obscure reason, 
there are no spaces between the 
words — I’ll just have to quote 
you a sample: 

heredeepdowninthegrave 

underthesodandloam 

underthecloudsandsky 

underthetreesandflowers 

iswhereiam 

geeiwonderifimdead 

That particular specimen of Beard- 
muttering is by Damon Knight . 
or as he preferred to have the name 
printed in his fannish days, damon 
knight. Sometimes demon 

knight. 

Fanzines are also partial to some- 
thing called Interlineations. 



I am not a louse. — Yngvi 

■ M B M M ■ HI H a B ■ V H M W ■ M H a a I 

That was an Istedmeation. They 
are usually nonsensical, often sur- 
realistic, sometimes dimly intelligi- 
ble. This one has reference to the 
phrase “Yngvi is a louse!” which 
appeared in the L. Sprague de Camp- 
Fletcher Pratt book. The Incomplete 



68 




Enchanter, Harold S3iea, the hero, is 
in jail some:where in Ihe world of 
Norse mythology and sees a prison- 
maite stagger to the bars and shout 
out this cryptic sentence at intervals 
dming the night. Nobody in Fandom 
knew what it meant, so they adopted 
it for its Nonsense value. 

Another word you’ll find in fan- 
zines is filler. A filler is what the 
editor gropes for when he’s stencil- 
ing a page and finds he has a blank 
five or six lines at the bottom. Most 
fillers are composed on the spot. 
Like this: 

Vve never seen a purple cow — 

It puts me in a rage! 

But I can end this pome right now, 
It's the bottom of the page. 

Perhaps this might have been a poem 
If I possessed the skill; 

But as things go, you see, my friend, 
/ had four lines to fill! 

Hardly immortal, eh? But then, 
who is? 

A bit earlier, I mentioned Non- 
sense. Fans like nonsense. Take the 
phrase ‘The Gostak distims the 



doshes.” It appeared in an old sf 
story by Miles J. Breuer. It meant 
little or nothmg — so fans picked 
it up. Another Nonsense-teim, once 
wildly popular, was vombic. Any- 
thing that is sort of . well . 
oh, you know ... is vombic. To 
vomb makes you a vombis, Vpmbists 
belong to societies for the advance- 
ment of vombii, ^^en you go 
around being vombic, you vombiate. 
To vombulate is to adopt an atti- 
tude of vombiation without actually 
getting out and being vombic. Un- 
derstand? 

Or take the Nonsense word — 
fout. That is what fans call an “all- 
purpose” word. It means absolutely 
nothing. But you can convey a lot 
by the context in Which you use it. 
For example: “Naw, it’s too fbuty 
for me!” connotes a deprecative 
meaning; “The new If is out! Hot 
fout!” implies extreme joy or exub- 
erance. Used without particular 
emphasis, it implies an enigmatic air 
of mystery. As in: See you next 
month, when Your Man in Fandom 
will be back with another fouty arti- 
cle of fannish lore!

TUNNEL 

WARRIOR 

by JOSEPH P. MARTINO 



Illustrated by MORROW 



They fought the roughest war 
men have ever engaged in — 
not on Earthy but under it! 



I suits and walk around on the out- 

side if they want to. That land out 

S ergeant Alvin Hodge adjusted the there hasn’t been walked on by hu- 

^ focus on the periscope and sur- man feet for at least two years. Here 

veyed the barren landscape, battered and there on the surface, little patches 

and pocked with craters. It looks like of green grass showed, as nature 

the pictures from the Moon-base, he tried to repair the damage man had 

thought. No, it’s even more desolate wrought. Back home in Kentucky, 

than the Moon. The men at the he thought, the morning glories 

Moon-base can put on their space- would be climbing all over every- 



70 





thing, and the trees would be green 
after the winter. Here, the spring 
rain falls on mud and bare rock. 

Abruptly the scene blacked out as 
the light-sensitive glass in the peri- 
scope’s optical system turned opaque 
under high intensity illumination. As 
the blackness slowly faded away, he 
could make out a writhing pillar of 
cloud pushing its way into the sky. 
At least a half dozen times every 
day one of these clouds made its 
appearance somewhere on the hori- 
zon. Our missiles? Theirs? No one 
knew except the men who had fired 
them. 

He scanned the periscope around. 
Off to the left, on a dear day, you 
could see what was left of the his- 
toric German city of Kassel, now 
just a pile of rubble. And off to the 
right, toward what used to be Vacha, 
in Thuringia, was where the Whole 
thing had started. 

No one was really clear on what 
had happened. Somehow or other, 
the East German and West German 
border guards had gotten to shoot- 
ing at each other. This had happened 
many times before, and nothing ever 
came of it. This time, however, 
world tensions were 'higher than 
usual because of the Iranian ques- 
tion, and the UN was paralyzied be- 
cause it was Red Ohina’s turn to be 
chairman of the Security Council. 
So in three days Europe had ex- 
ploded into nuclear war. Somehow 
the bombs had been confined to 
Germany, and both sides were rising 
pure-fusion clean weapons, so there 
was no fallout elsewhere. Both sides 
had dug in like moles and had been 
slugging it out ever since. 



Suddenly he was aware of some- 
one at his elbow . “Sergeant 
Hodge?” 

“Yes, what is it?” 

“I relieve you as Sergeant of the 
Watch. Here are your orders.” 

He took the proffered envelope, 
tore it open and pulled out the flimsy 
piece of paper. “Sergeant Hodge 
will report to Major Lowndes in 
Room 279, Gallery 3, Level 12, im- 
mediately upon receipt of this order.” 

R oom 279. That’s one of the 
rooms where they brief you for 
missions. It’s not right, he thought. 
It’s got to be a mistake. I had a mis- 
sion day before yesterday. Policy is 
for three days between missions. And 
the old, familiar premission feeling 
of having a lump of lead in his stom- 
ach hit ihim. He stalked into an ele- 
vator and pushed the button for the 
twelfth level. 

He saluted stiffly. “Sergeant 
Hodge reporting as ordered, sir.” 
The major returned his salute, 
studied his face for an instant and 
then spoke, softly. “Please sit down. 
Sergeant. You don’t think this is fair, 
do you? You should have had an- 
other day off, esi>eciaHy after a 
tough tunnel raid like the one you 
pulled off day before yesterday. Well, 
to start with, the business of three 
days between missions is not an ab- 
solute rule. It’s merely a policy to 
be followed whenever feasible. And 
you have to admit we do follow it 
pretty well. 

“But there have to be exceptions 
from time to time. This is one of 
the times. You’re one of the few 
experienced tunnel fighters available

today. As you know, we had a big 
efifert <nit yesterday, afid the men 
wlio were on that ihave had even less 
rest than you have. Besides, this n^- 
Bfon ought to be a ereampu^.’* 

He poimled to the Captain seated 
beside his desk. **l%is is Captain 
Maxwetl. Ife’s with the Directorate 
oi Geology, Deputy Chief of Staff 
for Intelligence. Your squad will es- 
cort him on this mission.” 

Servant Hodge looked at the Cap- 
tain. He noted the collar insignia 
the man was wearing and realized 
that the Captain was a Component 
Officer, rather than Line. He got 
the pay and privileges of an officer, 
but wasn’t allowed to command any- 
one outside his corps of specialists. 
Sergeant Hodges would in fact be 
in command on this mksioii. 

Major Lowndes went to a table 
beside his desk and pulled a doth 
off a model of the tunnel and bunker 
system. “Sergeant, you know a fair 
amount about our tunnel system, but 
you’ll have to know a few more 
things for today’s mission. 

•Here is our main bunker. It has 
a series of levels, running from fifty 
feet below the surface, down to near- 
ly twenty^fivc hundred feet below 
ground. It’s connected to similar 
bunkers on either side by these com- 
munication tunnels. Here, at two 
thousand feet down, is our forward 
tunnel. It toward this Russian 
bunker, about ten miles in front of 
us. The forward tunnel comes to a 
dead end just about halfway to the 
Russian bunker. Vertical shafts run 
up from it about every noile or so, 
iBokiding one right before the dead 
end. Each of these vertka! shafts 



has a series of horizontal galleries 
runninig sidewiays from it, at various 
levels. In the case of the shaft farth- 
est forward, each gaUery has addi- 
tional tunnels running toward the 
Russian lines. Htese are the tunnels 
where the fighting takes place, when- 
ever they meet a Russian tunnel, 
either by accident or design. I know 
you’re familiar with them. Now 
you’ve probably heard rumors we’re 
going on the offensive soon. To do 
that, we have to have ah accurate 
map of the Russian tunnel system.” 
“But I thought we got that from 
sound echo-ranging, Sir.” 

“To a certain extent we do. At 
close ranges we can map their tun- 
nels pretty well. But to do this we 
have to know the velocity of sound 
in the rock stratum we’re doing the 
echo-ranging in. Now the problem 
is right here.” He pointed to a spot 
on the model just ahead of the for- 
wardmost tunnel. “There’s geological 
fault here. The rock strata have been 
slipping past each other, like slicing 
a layer cake vertically, then moving 
one of the pieces up. We don’t have 
accurate information about the rock 
strata on the other side of the fault. 
We want your squad to escort Cap- 
tain Maxwell and a tunneling crew 
as they push a tunnel through this 
fault. Captain Maxwell will take 
samples and make measurements on 
the other side. If we can identify the 
stratum, we can tell how much slip 
there was in the fault and thus get 
complete information on the proper- 
ties of the rock on the other side. Tf

we’ll have a start on mapping the 
other side. Any questions?”

minutes.” 

Sergeant Hodge saluted and hur- 
ried out. Forty-five minutes didn’t 
leave much tinie. His men were all 
off duty and might be in the PX, 
watching a movie, reading in the li- 
brary (although he had to admit 
that was unlikely) or any one of a 
numiber of other places. 

II 

H e entered the concrete cubicle 
which was home for his squad 
and counted quickly. Fortunately 
they were all here. The usual four 
were playing their usual game of 
pinochle. Two more wore lying on 
their bunks, avidly devouring paper- 
backs with lurid covers. The remain- 
ing two were, cleaning their weapons, 
the short-barreled, small-caliber ma- 
chine guns which had replaced the 
rifle for tunnel fighting. 

“Tennessee” Harper, Private First 
Qass, a tall youthful-looking man 
with a permanent smile under his 
shock of blond hair, was vigorously 
running a cleaning rod through the 
barrel of his weapon. 

“Twelve more days,” he said in 



the soft aocents of his native state, 
“and I start my Rest and Recupera- 
lk>n leave in Paris. After surviving 
another three months of tunnel crawl- 
ing, I get two solid weeks with no 
missions, no alerts and no reveille. 
Just think, 111 have a real sky over 
my head. And aiH that French 
and those French ^ris. Especially 
the French girls. Ooh, la,. la.” 

Friedmann, whose collection of 
paperbacks was renowned through 
the entire corridor, lowered his book 
and joined the conversation. “Paris is 
fine, Tennessee, but wait till you’ve 
been here as long as I have. Once 
you’re over the hump, and you’ve 
got the first eighteen months of your 
tour behind you, you’ll start sweating 
out the Big R. You’ll take Paris, 
London, Madrid or the other R&R 
towns as they come, but rotation 
back to the States is what you’ll real- 
ly think about.” 

“I’M take your word for it, but the 
Big R is almost two years away for 
me. Three months is about as far 
ahead as I ever look anyway.” 

Pedro Sanchez, Mexican- Ameri- 
can, Corporal, and second in oom- 
mand of the squad, started to assem- 
ble his weapon. “Friend Tennessee, 
it is bad luck to talk about going 
on R&R just a few days 'before your 
three months are up. You shoidd . .*• 

“All right, knock it off.” Sergeant 
Hodge felt that just before a missioo 
was no time to talk about bad luck. 
“Get a move on, you guys. We’re 
due down at the tunnel head for a 
mission in about half an hour. Make 
it snappy.” 

“But we got another day of rest 
cornin’ . How come? . Why 



TUNNEL WARRIOR

US? ...” came the disgusted chorus 
of replies. 

“Because there’s a job to be done, 
and we’ve been told to do it, that’s 
why. And besides, this one sounds 
like a real oreampuff. Just don’t any- 
one go goofinig off, and we’ll get 
through this one with no sweat.” 
Then he started to change from his 
duty khakis to ooveralls more suited 
to tunnel fighting. Twenty minutes 
later, the squad was lined up in the 
Armory, while he check^ their 
equipment. First, the standard equip- 
ment they all carried, like the hard 
hats, the face mask with filter for 
dust and gas, the emergency bottle 
of oxygen, infrared goggles, infrared 
filters for the headlamps. Check the 
batteries in the headlamps. Then the 
weapons, basic load of ammunition, 
plus two grenades and two gas 
bombs for each man. Extra rations. 
Then the special equipment. Carson, 
one of the pinochle players, carried 
a flamethrower. Friedmann carried 
the Very Low Frequency induction 
radio. Williams, another pinocle play- 
er, carried the rocket launcher. And 
Tennessee carried the squad’s five- 
kilotop fusion bomb. All were in 
order. Even if the mission were to 
be a creampuff, the squad was too 
battle-wise to go slack. 

T ^hey stepped off the elevator at 
the head of thd forward tunnel at 
the appointed time. Captain Maxwell 
and the tunnelling crew were there 
already. As the heavy entrance door 
of the tunnel swung open, the men 
gripped their weapons tighter. The 
lump of lead in Sergeant Hodge’s 
stomach felt like it would carry him 



through the floor, right down 
through the solid rock. 

They filed into the tunnel and 
took seats in the vehicle waiting for 
them. In the lead was a jeep like 
vehicle with low-pressure, balloon 
tires, driven by a compressed-air 
engine which was supplied from a 
bottle of high-pressure air carried in 
the back. Sergeant Hodge and Cap- 
tain Maxwell would ride in that one. 
Behind that was a personnel carrier 
which would carry half the Squad 
and the tunnelling crew. Then came 
some specialized vehicles belonging 
to the tunnelling crew. Finally the 
rest of the squad brought up the rear 
in another jeep. All the vehicles rode 
on the balloon tires and used com- 
pressed air for power. This made far 
less noise to alert the Russian sound- 
detector operators and to confuse the 
American operators. In addition, the 
compressed-air motors avoided foul- 
ing the air and simplified the prob- 
lem of supplying air to the tunnels. 

At first the tunnel was broad and 
high, lined with concrete, well light- 
ed and well supplied with air. They 
drove swiftly towards the Russian 
lines, stopping at the oheck|X)ints at 
each 6f the vertical shafts. Finally 
they reached the last vertical shaft. 
Here the tunnel underwent a drastic 
transformation. Farther ahead, the 
walls were bare rock, the lighting 
consisted of an occasional bulb hang- 
ing from the ceiling, and the air 
was replenished by diffusion from 
the rest of the tunnel. From now 
on. that was the way the tunnels 
would be. They topped off their 
compressed-air Wtles from the tap 
at the end of the line. 



74 



IF 




Their vehicles were loaded, one 
at a time, onto a slowly rising ele- 
vator and carried up to the level 
from which they would operate, only 
about twelve hundred feet below 
the surface. They filed down the 
gallery parallel to their own lines, 
then turned towards the Russian 
lines again. They reached the final 
checkpK>int and stopped. The cor- 
poral in charge informed them that 
the tunnel extended another three 
hundred yards and came to a dead 
end. The detectors in the tunnel had 
given no indications of anyone 
breaking in, and a patrol which had 
gone all the way to the tunnel face 
less than two hours ago reported the 
tunnel clear. Their sound detectors 
had not found any signs of Russian 
activity in the vicinity, although 
there was believed to be a tunnel 
parallel to this one, about fifty to 
a hundred yards away. Armed with 
this assurance, they went forward 
with the usual caution. They left all 
the vehicles except those used in 
tunnelling at the checkpoint. In the 
event of an enemy breakthrough, 
it was much better to be on foot. 

As usual, Sergeant Hodge found 
that the lump of lead was gone 
from his stomach, and he couldn’t 
say ju§t when it had disappeared. 
He had been at this business a 
long time and felt sure he was 
stretching his luck far beyond any 
reasonable limits. If he kept it up, 
he would inevitably find that his 
luck had run out. Hence he was 
nervous about each new mission. 
But once he was back in the tun- 
nels, things were different. He could 
quit worrying about the future and 



wondering how long his luck would 
last. He concentrated on keeping 
alive for the immediate future. A 
small part of tunnel fighting in- 
volved a high level of tension and 
excitement, before a breakthrough 
into an enemy tunnel, wondering 
whether the enemy had detected 
you and you were heading into an 
ambush. By far the biggest part of 
the time, though, was spent just 
waiting. Waiting for the enemy to 
break through, waiting for the 
enemy to learn you had broken 
through, waiting for the enemy to 
enter your ambush. 

T his mission was just waiting and 
hoping that the Russians 
wouldn’t detect them or, even if 
they did, would decide not to do 
anything about it. Many men 
couldn’t take just waiting. T^ey got 
to thinking about all the tons of 
rock over their heads and how much 
nicer it was to walk the green 
earth under a blue sky, and they 
went tunnel-happy. Sergeant Hodge, 
however, had learned patient wait- 
ing as a boy in the Kentucky hills, 
hunting deer and small game. If 
you consider hunting as a sport, 
you can spend the day wandering 
around the hills, and it doesn't 
matter whether you see any game 
or not. When success at hunting 
means the difference between meat 
on the table or not, you learn to 
sit by the game trails and wait pa- 
tiently for something worth shoot- 
ing to come by. After a while, you 
even got to the point where you 
let small animals go by, confident 
that there will be a bigger one 



TUNNEL WARRIOR

along later. This was the kind of 
patience successful tunnel fighting 
called for. 

Sergeant Hodge led half his 
squad up to the tunnel face. There 
were no signs of trouble anywhere. 
Then the tunnelling crew brought 
their equipment to the tunnel face 
to begin work. Using a low-powered 
echo-sounder, Captain Maxwell de- 
termined that the earth fault w.as 
about three hundred yards ahead 
of them. That would take about six 
hours cutting time. Sergeant Hodge 
was glad he had made the men brin-g 
extra rations. It would be very un- 
usual if anyone brought them any 
rations while they were here. He 
placed half his squad midway be- 
tween the tunnel face and the check- 
point, where they could serve as 
a reserve and would also be useful 
if the Russians broke through into 
the tunnel behind the face. He kept 
the rest of the squad near the tun- 
nel face with him. He had seen tun- 
nel-cutting operations before, but 
they never ceased to fascinate him. 

The tunnelling crew used laser 
torches, powered by fuel cells in 
one of their trucks, to carve chunks 
of rock from the tunnel face. This 
made much less noise than more 
conventional techniques of boring 
and blasting. The rocks were then 
gripped by a special-purpose con- 
veyor and^ carried back from the 
tunnel face, where they were trans- 
ferr^ to a more conventional 
truck. When this was full, it hauled 
the rook back towards the main 
part of die tunnel, wbilc another 
truck took its place. The rock would 
be stored temporarily in an un- 



used tunnel. Later some of it would 
be used to block tunnels which were 
no longer desired, and the rest 
would be hauled behind the lines 
and dumped on the surface. 

Actually, the limit on tunnelling 
speed was the speed with which rock 
could be carried away from the 
tunnel face. The laser torches were 
capable of cutting away rock much 
faster than it could be hauled away. 
In making a major attack, in fact, 
a process known as “pioltng” was 
used. In that case, the rock was 
cut away, hauled back a hundred 
yards or so and dumped. Thus a 
section of tunnel roughly a hun- 
dred yards long, closed at both ends, 
was moved forward. Tunnelling 
rates well over a hundred yards per 
hour could be achieved this way. A 
precision, inertial navigator was re- 
quired to keep the tunnel on course. 
With the tunnel open at one end, 
as it was here, however, the con- 
ventional methods of using a transit 
and laser range finder were suffi- 
cient for keeping the tunnel on 
course. 

Behind the digging crew at the 
face of the tunnel came another 
crew. They inspected the tunnel 
walls and ceiling for weak spots and 
applied braces and shoring as need- 
ed. They smoothed the tunnel floor 
and cut any projections from the 
walls. Every twenty yards, on al- 
ternate sides of the tunnel, the 
cut niches. These were man-high 
and big enough for two men. The 
side of the niche toward the tun- 
nel face was cut perpendicular to 
the tunnel wall. The side away from 
the tunnel face was cut at approxi- 



76 



IF 




mately forty-five degrees, so that 
the niche narrowed as it went deep- 
er. Finally they strung lights on 
wires suspended from the ceiling. 
These were connected to the main 
power network of the bunker and 
galleries. Here, they had merely 
needed to tap into the wires com- 
ing up to the checkpoint. 

A fter a while Sergeant Hodge 
grew tired of watching the work 
of tunnelling and made a patrol of 
the tunnel back to the check{x>int. 
The men on the sound detector re- 
ported that the noise of hauling 
rock drowned out everything else, 
but that couldn’t be helped. Final- 
ly he sat down to rest along the 
edge of the tunnel, out of the way 
of the vehicles. His men were ab- 
solutely silent. There was no small 
talk, none of the traditional grip- 
ing of soldiers. The tunnelling, 
though much quieter than conven- 
tional digging methods, was still 
louder than normal conversation. 
However, habits acquired in com- 
bat ''re hard to break. When wait- 
ing in position, you did not talk, 
lest the enemy discover where you 
were. 

At last, at almost six hours on 
the dot, there was a sudden buzz 
of excitement at the tunnel face. 
There had been a sudden change 
in the color and texture of the 
rock. They had reached the earth 
fault. The fault here was marked 
by patches of gravel and fragments, 
where the rock strata had ground 
against each other. The tunnel 
would have to be extended a few 
yards beyond the fault to assure an 



uncontaminated sample of the other 
stratum at this same level, but that 
was the work of a few minutes. 
Then Captain Maxwell, using a 
miniature version of the larger 
laser torches, cut off a few pocket- 
sized specimens of rock. He buried 
probes in the rock and made some 
in situ measurements of sound velo- 
city. Then he packed up his gear 
and turned to go. The effect on 
the tunnelling crew was as though 
a tremendous pressure had been 
removed. In a few minutes they 
would well be out of here. 

Sergeant Hodge felt the same 
relaxation of tension, then steeled 
himself against it. He brought the 
men with him to the tunnel face and 
sent one of the tunnelling crew as 
a runner to order the rest of the 
squad forward and to alert the 
dieckpoint they were coming. He 
didn’t intend to relax until they 
were well back into friendly terri- 
tory. He followed the digging crew 
away from the tunnel face for about 
fifty yards, when he heard a noise 
behind him. He turned, to see the 
tunnel wall cave in just this side 
of the tunnel face. An explosion 
followed, and the lights went out. 

He dropped to a crouch and 
scuttled toward the tunnel face, 
brushing his left arm against the 
tunnel wall. He threw himself into 
the first niche he found, triggered 
off a short burst toward the tunnel 
face and ducked out of the way of 
the fusillade that came back at 
him. Within seconds, he had slipped 
an infrared filter over his head- 
lamp, turned on the lamp, flipped 
his infrared goggles on and stuck 



78 



IF 




the tube from his oxygen bottle 
between his teeth, where he could 
bite down on the valve and mouth- 
breathe oxygen if the air grew too 
foul. 

He peered back into the tunnel. 
A steady stream of Russians was 
pouring through the breach in the 
tunnel wall. As they entered the 
tunnel, they hugged the walls, 
sprawled on the floor or found 
what shelter they could behind the 
debris their explosion had caused. 
A veritable storm of bullets was 
sweeping the tunnel face, taking a 
high toll of the entering Russians. 
However, within seconds, they 
would have a force large enough 
to overwhelm his squad, despite 
their inevitable high losses. 

First things first. He blew a series 
of blasts on his whistle. An answer- 
ing series from Sanchez told him that 
Tennessee was in position with the 
fusion bomb. As a last resort, the 
bomb could be set off and the tun- 
nel sealed, keeping the Russians out 
of the rest of the gallery. The next 
was to stop the flow of Russians into 
the tunnel. 

Carson, with the flamethrower, 
was too far back to help now. What 
else might be used? He had seen it 
done once that way . He blew 
another series of blasts and yelled, 
“Use the lasers!” 

W ithin seconds the tunnel was 
filled with an eerie light. 
Someone had gotten one of the 
laser torches going and was playing 
it over the breach in the tunnel wall. 
At that range the beam was defo- 
cussed and would not melt rock. The 



energy density was still high enough 
to char flesh and flash coveralls 
into flame, however. The stream of 
reinforcements entering the tunnel 
was cut off abruptly, while the men 
in the tunnel concentrated their fire 
on the laser in an attempt to knock 
it out. 

The next step was to clean out 
those Russians remaining in the tun- 
nel and to do it in the few seconds 
the laser was likely to continue oper- 
ating. There were perhaps a dozen 
Russians in the tunnel still putting 
up some fight. They were almost 
totally unsheltered, however. A few 
had tried firing from one of the 
niches in the tunnel wall, but found 
that the sloping, rear side of the 
niche gave almost no protection 
against fire from the direction of the 
tunnel head. 

Hodge was startled as something 
streaked past him, then he realized 
that Williams had brought his rocket 
launcher into action. The launcher 
was equipped with a laser range 
finder, and the rocket fuses could 
be set to burst at a given range, 
with a precision of a foot or two. 
Thus William could burst a rocket 
right beside a standing man or right 
above a man lying prone, sleeting 
him with shrapnel. 

Sergeant Hodge blew his whistle 
again. Under cover of Williams’ roc- 
ket fire, the rearmost members of 
the squad started moving up from 
one niche to the next. The moves 
were made with only one man ex- 
posed at a time, and he had to run 
only the twenty yards to the next 
niche. All the men not running add- 
ed the weight of their fire in an at- 



TUNNEL WARRIOR 



79 




tempt to disrupt the return fire of 
the Russians. 

Hiefi the tunnel was pitched into 
blackness again, as the las^ went 
out ffi a shower of pyrotechinics. 
Hodge blew a long blast on his 
whistle, and the whole squad was 
out in the tunnel, running for the 
hazy glow cast by the Russians’ 
infrared headlamps. Some of the 
Russians stood and fought and were 
quickly overwhelmed. The rest dis- 
appeared through their entry tun- 
nel. 

Carson and Hodge reached the 
opening at the same time. Carson 
unlimbered his flamethrower and 
started it spraying back up the Rus- 
sians’ tunnel. Then the whole squad 
was charging into the tunnel. They 
were met half way by another group 
of Russians. The earsplitting clatter 
of machine guns filled the tunnel 
until the two groups closed with 
each other. Curses and grunts min- 
gled with the acrid smoke and 
gloom. 

A figure in a Russian hard hat 
loomed up in front of Hodge. The 
figure raised his weapon like a club, 
and Hodge delivered a quick kick 
to the knee, then dodged the now 
badly aimed blow. Hodge jabbed 
the muzzle of his gun hard right 
under the other’s rib cage, then 
stepped back. As the figure doubled 
over, Hodge brought his knee up 
into the other’s face and smashed 
the -buitt of his weapon down on the 
other’s hack, just below the rim 
of the hard hat. 

As the figure slumped to the 
floor, Hodge was bumped from the 
side. He stumbled and regained his 



balance. He found that he bad been 
bumped by a Russian who was in- 
tent on honung into a fight between 
another Russian and one of Hodge’s 
men. Hodge tripped him with a gun 
barrei between the legs and finish- 
ed him with a short burst while he 
was down. Then he swiveled to 
parry the attack of a Russian coming 
at him from die other side, who in 
turn was taken from the side by an- 
other of Hodge’s men. 

Then finally there Were no more 
Russians left standing. Hodge count- 
ed three of his squad besides himself 
still on thear feet. Friedmann was 
down, wounded but still alive. San- 
chez, a bloody trench knife gripped 
in his right hand, was examining the 
Russians to make sure they were 
dead. Carson was retrieving his 
flamethrowty from where he had 
dropped it when the hand-toTiand 
fighting started. Williams was sal- 
vaging ammunition from the dead 
Americans. 

S anchez turned over one of the 
Americans and spw>ke softly. 
“Friend Tennessee, I told you not 
to make your own bad luck. Now 
may God have mercy on you.” 
Hodge spoke up, “Sanchez, get 
that fusion bomb Tennessee was car- 
rying and get someone else to cany 
it. Carson, see how things are back 
in our tunnel. Find Maxwell if you 
can. Friedmann, see if you can raise 
Birdseye on the radio for me.” 
“Birdseye, this is Birdseye Twelve. 
Come in please. Birdseye, this is 
Birdseye Twelve. Come in please.” 
“Birdseye Twelve, this is Birds- 
eye. What is your situation?” 



80 



IF 




Sergeant Hodge took the micro- 
phone. “This is Birdseye Twelve. 
I’m down to four effectives, in- 
cluding myself, plus one wounded. 
We bad completed our misMon when 
the Russians attacked. Hold on just 
a minute,” he said, as Carson and 
Maxwell showed up. 

“How are things out there?” 

Maxwell replied, “Not as bad as 
we thought at first. About one third 
of the tunnelling crew are woimded, 
and they have a few dead. Most of 
their tunnelling equipment is wreck- 
ed, but all our transportation is still 
intact back at the checkpoint. I’ve 
still got my samples and data. 
They’re carrying back the dead and 
wounded now.” 

Sergeant Hodge repeated this in- 
formation to Birdseye, then went 
on. “We seem to have lucked into a 
Russian tunnel here. It would take 
several squads to exploit it properly. 
We can try to hold the entrance until 
you can get more troops here, or we 
can seal it. In any case, I think we 
need reinforcements to escort the 
tunnelling crew back. What do you 
want us to do?” 

“Do you have a fusion bomb 
with you?” 

“Yes, Sir.” 

“Very well. There’s a squad in a 
nearby tunnel. They can be brought 
around as an escort for the tunneling 
crew. We just don’t have any forces 
available to exploit the tunnel.* Take 
your fusion bomb as far up the Rus- 
sian tiuinel as you can and set it 
off there. It will seal the one tunnel 
and may collapse some of their 
others. Don’t wak for tihe tunnelling 
crew’s escort, but get die crew start- 



ed back without their escort. Any 
questions?” 

“No, Sir. Over and out.” He re- 
turned the micsxiphone to Pried- 
mann. 

He turned to Sanchez. “See sf the 
Russians lelt any vehicles up ahead 
we can im€. If not, 'we’U tovc to 
bring a jeep up from the check- 
point and t^ to get it through this 
intercept tunnel the Russians dug.” 

Sanchez was back shortly. “Yes, 
there are several Russian jeeps and 
a personnel carrier up here.” 

“We’ll take one of the jeeps. I’M 
drive. Get me a Russian hard hat 
to wear. The rest of you will crouch 
down in the back. And Sanchez, 
make sure that bomb is on a dead- 
man setting. If they ambush us,’ I 
want to make sure the bomb goes 
off. There will be no talking on 
the way. They undoubtedly have 
the tunnel bugged, and our speak- 
ing English would tip them off. We’ll 
drive up the tunnel a couple of 
miles and set the bomb. If we get 
to a checkpoint before that, we’ll 
just drive up to it and start shoot- 
ing. There’s no way to sneak up on 
a checkpoint in a tunnel like this.” 

They drove swiftly down the tun- 
nel. At first it was narrow, low and 
badly lighted. After a thousand 
yards or so, it started to widen out; 
then after another thousand yards, 
it became smooth surfaced and lined 
with concrete. The lights were now 
set into the ceding instead of hang- 
ing suspended from wires. There 
were air vents set into the wall at 
regular intervals, indicating that this 
portion of the tunind had forced 
ventilation. Oeady this was no

temporary or exploratory tunnel. 
They had tapped into one of the 
Russian’s main tunnels. Then they 
saw, a few hundred yards ahead, 
three or four vehicles lined up along 
the side of the tunnel. This was 
evidently the first Russian check- 
point. 

Qei^eant Hodge drove up at a 
sedate pace, apparently drawing 
no i>articular notice from the hand- 
ful of Russians bustling about the 
veihicles and standing by the tun- 
nel well. They evidently saw no 
cause for alarm in a single vehicle, 
driven by a single man wthose hard 
hat had the proper silhouette. 

Sergeant Hodge glanced at the 
checkpoint as he drove abreast of 
it. Instead of the fjimiliar little pock- 
et in the side of the tunnel, used 
by the Americans, this was a rather 
elaborate affair, with a small office 
containing a desk and several chairs 
behind a counter which fronted on 
the tunnel. From a small balcony 
to one side, a pair of machine guns 
covered the tunnel, but only one of 
these was manned. 

The machine gunner died first, in 
the fiery stream from Carson’s flame- 
thrower. The Russians standing in 
the tunnel were cut down quickly, 
most of them even before they real- 
ized there was a fight going on. 
Hodige lobbed a grenade into the 
office and vaulted over the coun- 
ter immediately after the explosion, 
to make sure all resistance there was 
eliminiated. He then turned back. 

“Williams, get one of those Rus- 
sian machine guns aimed up the 
tunnel, just in case they send some- 



one to investigate the shooting. Car- 
son, see if one of those vehicles has 
more air in its tank than ours does. 
If so, we’ll take it instead. Sanchez, 
get that bomb set to detonate im- 
mediately if tampered with and set 
the time fuse for ten minutes.’’ 
Sergeant Hodge then started rum- 
maging through the desk drawers. 
Orders, ledger sheets, messages, per- 
sonal letters, anything might turn 
out to be of some value to the In- 
telligence people. He caught a 
glimpse of movement at the back 
door of the office, swiveled around 
and fired by reflex. A figure pitched 
through the doorway and face 
down. Only then did he notice the 
long black hair showing below the 
uniform cap. He went over to the 
figure and turned it over. Below 
the crown of long, silky black hair, 
a pair of soft brown eyes stared 
sightlessly out of a young, pretty, 
Slavic face. The soft, pleasingly 
rounded contours of her uniform 
jacket were disfigured by still- 
spreading dark splotches. 

“Sergeant Hodge?’’ 

He jerked himself upright. “Yes, 
Sanchez?” 

“The bomb is ready to go.” 

“Start the timer.” He reached 
down and closed her eyelids, then 
dashed for the jeep.

T he debriefing officer stared 
across his desk at Sergeant 
Hodge. “You’re sure that’s all, Ser- 
geant?” 

“Yes, Sir. I’ve given you all the 
details I can remember.”

“Then what’s eating you? You’ve 
never before acted like this after a 
mission.” 

“I keep thinking about that Rus- 
sian woman.” 

“So that’s it. Okay, so the Rus- 
sians have women in the bunkers 
with them. They probably assign 
them to noncombatant jobs like 
clerks, or cooks or communications 
technicians. And as an additional 
duty, they keep the troops happy. 
The Russians have always been more 
practical about things like that than 
we have. If that’s what’s bothering 
you, ni recommend you for a 
week’s R & R in Paris. In fact, 
ril recommend your whole squad. 
After a fight like that, you de- 
serve it anyway.” 

. Sergeant Hodge answered in a 
dull voice. “rU accept your offer, 
Sir. We do need the rest. But that 
won’t really help. It won’t make me 
forget I killed a young girl who was 
maybe all of twenty years old.” Then 
his voice filled with anguish. “Sir, 
I’ve been Regular Army since I was 
o^d enough to enlist. I’ve been in 
nv^re brushfirc wars, police actions 
nnd border incidents than I can keep 
track of. They were all bloody and 
caused a lot of people a lot of 
grief, but at least they seemed to 
make sense. I knew why I was fight- 
inf?, and I could see how it was 
helping someone. But this is differ- 
ent. Why does a young girl like 
that, who ought/to be courting or 
going to dances or whatever it is 
that Russian girls do, have to get 
mixed up in the grubby business of 
tunnel fighting and end up dead 
on the floor of a tunniel, in a pud- 



dle of her own blood? Or how about 
Tennessee, who got more fun out of 
life than any other man I ever met? 
How come he had to die like a 
mole, grappling with some other 
mo-lcs, in a dark stinking mole hole 
a quarter of a mile underground? 
It doesn’t make any sense. It’s nodi- 
ing but a mess. How’d we ever get 
into it anyway?” 

“The pendulum swung when we 
weren’t looking.” 

“What’s that, Sir?” 

“Look, there’s always tragedy in 
war. If you grant that war is an 
acceptable means of settling political 
disputes, then you have to accept 
a certain amount of the tragedy as 
unavoidable, since wars are usually 
fought by the young and healthy. 
But there’s a lot of tragedy, like the 
death of that girl and like the man- 
ner of the death of your friend 
Tennessee, that’s really unneces- 
sary. It comes from being unprepar- 
ed for war or being prepared for 
the wrong kind of war. 

“You can think of the relation 
between offense and defense in war 
as like a pendukwn. One time the 
offense is overwhelming, then later 
the pendulum swings and defense 
is invulnerable. Docs the term ‘Mag- 
inot Line* mean anything to you?” 
“Umitim, not a thing. Sir.” 

“Well, let’s look at a bit of his- 
tory. Back in 1914, everyone thought 
that a modem war would be over 
in a short time. Economists decreed 
that highly integrated modern econo- 
my just couldn’t stand the strain of 
a prolonged war, with its disruption 
of trade. A war was to be won by 
a few decisive 'battles right at the 



84 



IF 




outset. The victor would be the one 
who hurled all his offensive force 
inito the battle first. 

“But it didn’t work that way. 
While everyone was busy planning 
his offense, the pendulum had swung 
to the defense. Trenches protected 
by barbed wire and machine guns 
wore nearly impregnable. British and 
French attacks on German trenches 
frequently cost ten thousand dead 
in a single day and achieved a pene- 
tration of the enemy lines of a few 
hundred yards at most. 

“So the French, in their war 
preparations, decided to build a line 
of fortifications along their Ger- 
man frontier. This was the Maginot 
Line, a steel-and-concrete super 
trench which was to be even more 
impregnable than the trenches of 
1918, while giving the troops all the 
comforts of home. But while they 
gave their attention to blueprints 
and concrete mixers, the pendulum 
swung back. The airplane and the 
tank made the offensive overwhelm- 
ing. 

“So we and everyone else, drew 
a lesson from this. Mobility was the 
key. Faster tanks, bigger Armored 
Personnel Carriers, more fighter 
bombers were the answers. 

again it didn’t work 
VV out that way. If the enemy 
uses nuclear weapons against you, 
you have to dig in deep for protec- 
tion. 

“How could we have prepared 
better for it, if we had realized that 
a defensive which, can withstand a 
nuclear weapon can surely withstand 
anything less? I don’t know. We 



might have been smart enough to 
avoid having the war altogether. It 
doesn’t maitter any naore. The real 
problem is how do we get out of 
it? I don’t know, and I don’t think 
anyone else does either. There don’t 
seem to be any shortcuts. We don’t 
bomb the Russians’ railroad m^- 
shalling yards because they’d bomb 
our Atlantic ports in retaliation, and 
no one knows where the retaliation 
and counter retaliation would end. 
Likewise, they don’t send their subs 
after our shipping, because then 
we’d have to bomb their sub pens. 
So both sides are able to harness 
their entire Gross National Product 
to war production and send it over 
here where we’re engaged in a vast 
underground wrestling match. It 
looks like it’ll end the same way 
World War I did, when one side 
goes broke before the other. I’m an 
optimist, after a fashion. Since our 
GNP is over twice theirs, I believe 
we’re bound to win in the end. AH 
it will cost us is a couple of decades 
of economic growth and a generation 
of young men. 

“Well, I’ve said enough. On that 
relatively pleasant note I’ll end. En- 
joy your leave in Paris and try to 
come back all charged* up and ready 
to do battle again.” 

Sergeant Hodge rose, saluted and 
walked out glumly. That old familiar 
lump of lead was back with him 
again, trying to pull him down 
through the floor. And this time, 
he knew, it wasn’t going to go away. 
It would be with him until, some- 
where in some dark tunnel, his luck 
would run out at last.

You con get used to anything^ 
out on the for reoches of the 
goloxy — anything but Earth!

4 4'T^hey’re coming in,” Karlsen 
A announced in that exact, per- 
functory .way of his. “Bang on 
schedule. Beam 391, approaching 
outer asteroid belt. Decelerating to 
half the speed of light. Should land 
at 0532 our time.” 

“That comiputer’s always slow,” 
Spandrel! goaded him. “I could work 
it out better with an abacus. If I had 
an abacus.” 



“Generals always do,” Ngomo 
grunted. 

I raised an eyebrow, half to signi- 
fy that rank was rank and generals 
did as they pleased and half to ask 
what it was they always. 

“Arrive on schedule. An hour be- 
fore first dawn.” 

“It’s our first visit,” Spandrell ar- 
gued. “How do you know they come 
half an hour before first dawn?” 
“They do everywhere else,” 
Ngomo said. “Why should this be 



86 




any different? With any luck, Karl- 
sen’s got his beams mixed up, and 
he’ll land in the swamp.” 

“Could you fix k, Karlsen?” Ingles 
asked, a wry gleam in his green 
alien eyes. 

The time had certainly come to 
assert my authority. They were quite 
capable of oraslhing the general’s ship 
without even asking me first. That 
is the trouble with outposts. A few 
dozen technicians, boffins, admin 
staff, laiborers, all fadnig the same 
hazards, conscious of sharing a com- 
mon identity, the bond of one head 
and two legs. A voice and a home 
somewhere in some place out on the 
fringe of the galaxy. All except Ingles 
— and he was human as the rest of 
uis for all his green eyes and yellow, 
blue -veined hands. There was a ten- 
dency to forget who was who. What 
exactly a general’s insignia looked 
like. Why I alone wear a khaki uni- 
form and carry a stick. Why in fact 
I was there at all. For the whole 
582 days of the VX 91/6 year on 
no day of 36.7 hours earth time had 
anyone addressed me as colonel. 
‘Geoff or ‘Bud’ — thumbs up, 
thumbs down and Natascha, who 
called me Boris. 

“Listen, all of you!” I said. “Gen- 
eral Kalen’s 'the boss of all outer- 
fringe exploration. We rely on him 
and the rest of them down wherever 
tliey are in the galaxy for supplies. 
This is his first visit, and if he’s hap- 
py, it’ll be his last. He’s getting our 
reports regularly through the electro- 
mag accelerator, and he should 
know the difficulties. He’s landing 
at the right time anyway. If he 
comes down an hour before first 



dawn, we’ll have time to get him 
and his craft under the net before 
the bombardment. The goons nev- 
er let loose before second dawn 
with the binary well above the 
horizon. We’ll have no nonsense 
about ditching him in the swamp. 
Instead, we’ll have a general smarten- 
ing up all round. An air of rattling 
efficiency and — what’s - that thing 
called?” 

“Esprit de corps!” Karlsen 
prompted. 

“Esprit de corps — what?” 

“Esprit de corps. Colonel!” 
“That’s better!” I looked round 
at the heavy, masklike faces, pale 
in the harsh light of the luminoid 
slung from the dome of the steel 
beehive structure I termed my H.Q. 
The hodge-pKxlge of equipment, 
bunks, tables, chairs, desks with 
ledgers, coffee pots and beakers. 
There was a dart board on the wall 
backed by a map of the outer seven 
colonial spheres. Some pictures by 
Ingles, an incredibly observant artist, 
of Natascha posed like an Hama- 
dryad on a petrified log. There was 
an auroch’s head with a hook on 
its nose and quoits for throwing at it. 
Pretty general stuff for an outstation. 
Nothing much, I thought, to im- 
press the general with what we were 
all there for. What were we here for? 
There wasn’t much in the outer 
seven, and one planet looked very 
like another. 

K arlsen threw a switch and pro- 
jected a hazy outline of a ship 
with retromotors firing against a 
background of stars and someone’s 
smudged thumb-print on the screen.

“Here he comes!” he said, 
Ngomo sighed and shook bis head, 
*l'd better get the cait out cm the 
landing strii) and ‘bring him in fast.” 
“Fast — what?” 

“Past — Coionell” 

Spandrel unhooked his helmet 
from the main switch of the eleotro- 
mag accelerator. “Okay to use land- 
ing lights, or will that invite the 
goons to lob one over just for luek?” 
he asked. 

“They’ve never fired one in the 
dark yet. Lights look like someone 
lives here. Use them!” I decided. 
“He’s coming in on the beam all 
right?” 

“Right in the beam, Colonel!” 

I snapped my fingers, and Wal- 
dron brought my helmet and levita- 
tor harness. Grinning, he fixed the 
straps. 

“I come with you. Colonel?” 

I thought about it. It looked better 
to have an aide, even an obvious im- 
becile like Waldron, whose nerve 
had gone the day we discovered Ras- 
tus. Rastus had taken a fancy to 
Waldron and pinioned him with a 
friendly tentacle. It bad taken all 
Natascha’s coaxing to make hkn let 
go, and Waldron had never been the 
same man since. But he was loyal 
and useful and harmless and a 
presence to stand behind me. With 
any luck the general would no-t no- 
tice the grin ‘under the fish bowl of 
his helmet and the twitch of the 
hands in his mittens. 

“Come along!” I said. My voice 
rasped with a new electronic note of 
authority with the headspeaker in 
place. “It’s ‘colonel’ from now on 
and jump to it. Let him see us as a 



highly efiricient little force holding 
out against kisuiperiable odds. Let 
him see Rastus and a Goon bom- 
bardment, and we’ll all get medals 
and go home. If he thinks some- 
one else could do it better, you’ll 
have a new C.O. and regiments of 
space administrators and the military. 
Do you want bull and the goons 
too?” 

“No,” they said. “No, Colonel!” 

“Right!” I ordered. “Open up, 
and let’s go meet him!” . 

“Sir!” Inglis snapped to attention 
and Mcked the activates: mechanism 
wkh one of his prehensile suckers. 
The inner door to the airlock open- 
ed, and Natascha stepped out. 

“Why, Boris!” she said. 

“TeU her!” I ordered them. “And 
see to it she understands!” 

Ngomo brought a cat round to 
the door, and I climbed aboard with 
Waldron and Spandrell. Ngomo 
drove us through the little cluster of 
beehives that made up our station 
to the perimeter of the chain-link 
dome that covered the safety area. 
Spandrel heaved on the pulleys that 
raised a few yards of the curtain high 
enough for Ngomo to get the cat 
through. 

“Leave it up!” I ordered. “Tlic 
bubbles won’t find that hole be- 
fore we get back!” 

II 

W e drove to the air strip, and a 
hundred-square-meter postage 
stamp cleared in the waving marsh 
grass at a safe distance from ^ 
Rastus swamp. We had made the 
track from the boles of ossified trees 



88 



IF 




and the mud from the swamp that 
dried quickly like aspalt. On either 
side, the ground was wet and spongy 
and blaok wkh the debris of ancient 
forests like soft, glutinous coal. 

“Blowing a gale as usual.” Ngomo, 
himself as black as the swamp, had 
a way of noticing the obvious and 
the worst of it at that. Show him 
a pearl, and he would see only the 
oyster. The night was brilliant silver 
in the light of the three moons. Aglia, 
Euphrosyne and Thalia. We had 
thought it a pity to give them the 
usual numbers after the second obli- 
que stroke. VX 91/6/1, 2 and 3. 

The stark beauty of it all moved 
Waldron to quote from a forgotten 
earth poet. “How sweet the moon- 
light sleeps upon this bank!” A 
long way, I thought, from that bank 
of the wild thyme and the sin- 
gle moon and winds that blew air 
one breathed and smelled and used 
to turn windmills with. No one knew 
what this wind was made of. It de- 
fied all analysis. It was not just a 
new grouping of atoms into an un- 
known molecular structure. Even 
the atom itself was different. Energy 
in a form that became wind blowing 
wi!h the dawns from the goon land, 
but sotmehow the swamp grass ab- 
sorbed it. No photosynthesis. No 
chlorophyll. Just tall, yellow, osier- 
like grass that sucked up water and 
a dozen unnamed minerals with a 
breathing in and oqt of wind. We 
turned our faceshields to the sky. 
Above US, the approaching fire of 
the ship's motors was suddenly ex- 
tinguisihod. 

“Retros cut, parachutes open. 
Landing now!” Karlsen’s voice an- 



nounced in my headphones. The 
radar confirmed the evidence of my 
eyes. I was surprised. You never 
knew with Karlsen, and we’d hump- 
ed his equipment around so many 
planets. One day we’d find a gas his 
beams wouldn’t go through, and 
then perhaps tiie bigwigs would leave 
us alone. 

“There it is,” Ngoma pointed. 
“Coming out of the sky wobbling 
like a belly dancer’s navel. This wind 
should shake him up a bit.” 

“Thou art not more unkind,” 
Waldron quoted, “than man’s in- 
gratitude.” He refrred, I thought, 
to the wind rather than to Ngomo’s 
belly dancer. We waited, and the long 
arms of the landing gear extended 
as the ship touched down safely on 
the strip. The loud speakers blared 
the supranational anthem “God save 
our glorious world” from the four 
corners of our postage stamp. A hap- 
py thought on Karlsen’s part, who 
apparently had it on tape in the H.Q. 
The general came down the ladder 
clearly impressed. His hand was 
raised in salute, fingers touching the 
tips of helmet antennae. 

“Welcome to VX91/6, General!” 

“Glad to be here, Carruthers. 
Glad to be here.” 

He took a look round for a guard 
of honor needing inspection, and a 
lot of aides came down the ladder 
behind, keeping step rung by rung. 
I looked apprehensively at that point 
on the horizon we called, for nostal- 
gic reasons, east. Already, purple and 
orange rays were flashing upwards 
from the general area where soon the 
arc of the first ball of the binary 
would blink, to be followed in ten

minutes by its twin and second dawn. 
Purple merging with orange, a 
green-gold and then, just before full 
binary, a new color, indescribable 
in earth words. We had named it 
auron — the halo of the new world. 
VX91/6. The gang rushed to the 
derricks and was lowering the ships 
nose down towards the transporter 
almost before the general set foot 
for the first time on our planet. I 
led him quickly to the cat. The aides 
followed in single file. 

“Come aboard, General.” 

“You certainly hustle here, Car- 
ruthers. I like to see hustle.” So that 
was my name! I had wondered. 
“Yes, General. Come aboard.” 

“So this is VX 91/6?” 

“All of it, General. We can get 
your staff on too if they pack tight.” 
“Is it all as dead as this?” 

“Quite dead, General. Up you 
come! It’s nearly first dawn.” 

“And that would be the dawn over 
there? A magnificent sight.” 

“Marvelous. There’s very little 
time, General. The bomibardment 
starts at second dawn.” 

T he general’s hand strayed to the 
lumivex shield of his headpiece, 
unconsciously stroking upwards the 
outline of an imaginary mustache. 

“My dear Carruthers! I have been 
under fire before, you know. This 
concern for my safety is hardly neces- 
sary. I remember once on XL 65 — 
glass shells, they were. Shrapnel. 
Jagged lumps of it. And then on TS 
20, the theta rays. I have managed 
to survive. What form does your 
bombard me^nt take? Your reports 
were somewhat reticent.” 



“Bubbles!” Waldron began to 
sing. “Empty bubbles in the air, 
they fell to earth I knew not where.” 
“Quite,” said the general, glaring 
at him with two bright eyes inside 
his helmet. “Your name would 
be . .?” 

“Waldron,” I introduced, “My — 
er — side-kick.” 

“Side-kick?” 

“No,” I said, “that’s not the right 
word, is it? We’ve been away so long, 
I forget which is rank proper and 
which is rank derogatory. He’s a 
good chap anyway.” 

The general was making some 
noises about being sure he was and 
meaning sure he wasn’t, when I saw 
the bubble. It was drifting in the 
apparent aimless, coquettish way of 
bubbles over the swamp grass, bob- 
bing up and down in the wind. The 
dawn lights were reflected, sparkling 
on its surface like patterns of one 
oil drop in a puddle. 

“Everyone down!” I shouted. 

The ship crashed on to the trans- 
porter with an almighty clang as 
the gang dived beneath it. Ngomo 
and Waldron flattened themselves on 
the lee side of the cat. Only the 
general and his half dozen aides 
stood, for all the world like a row 
of gasoline pumps with notebooks 
and pencils in the crook of an arm 
where the notch for the no 2 zle should 
have been. I brought him down with 
a Rugby tackle, and his staff follow- 
ed their leader in the best military 
tradition. He said something like 
‘monstrous’ or ‘outrageous’ or 
‘court martial’ — it was difficult to 
get the exact message. His antennae 
had twisted with the fall, and there 



90 



IF 




was some disitCHtion. Fortunately for 
aU of us, before anydiing decipher- 
able came Itirough, the bubble 
swooped* and the cal was vaporized 
in a puff of hot steam. 

‘"Lie still!” I shouted. “Don’t do 
anything to annoy it, and perhaps 
it’ll go away!” 

We were never sure whether the 
bubbles could hear us or not. Bubbles 
are very like the god-in-chief that 
every planet seemed to have. You 
never knew if they really existed or 
how they stood in relation to yours, 
and you treated them with respect, 
just in case. Left alone, the bubbles 
never came down to ground level. 
They concentrated on anything 
metal. We had lost a lot of equip- 
ment that way but so far, with pru- 
dence, not a single man. An aide 
cautiously straightened the general’s 
antennae, an action I thought worthy 
of a purple heart or whatever it is 
they give heroes these days. 

“What is it?” he asked when the 
operation was completed. 

“The bombardment,” I told him. 
“They’re early today. They probably 
knew you were coming. We’ll move 
before they all are able to get the 
range.” 

The bubble drifted away over a 
hummock of phosphorescent horn- 
blende Natascha had sculpted into a 
fair semblance of .an X60 man-eating 
frog-goddess and down the track 
toward our enclosure. It would even- 
tuiaUy expend itself on the protec- 
tive netting which channeled its en- 
ergy store to earth or at least to VX 
91. The gang climbed aboard the 
transporter and started the motors. 
There was a general rush to get home 



before the next one came floating 
downwind. 

“We’ll walk,” I told the general. 
“I wouldn’t like to be near your 
ship if they get it.” 

“Get my ship?” he asked in- 
credulously. 

“They get everything,” I said. 
“We’ve got one, but it’s no use to a 
general. It was obsolescent years ago, 
and the maintenance team all went 
down with U.26 plague before we 
found the antidote. In fifty yeafs, it’s 
never seen an oU-can.” 

“I see,” be said. 

“We’ll go by the swamp,” I direct- 
ed. “We’re safer with Rastus. Rastus 
kno'ws all about bubbles.” 

“Anything you say, Carruthers,” 
he agreed. “Anything you say.” His 
helmet was overlarge, and his head 
inside reminded me of a hermit crab 
in a cockle shell. 

m 

T here were no more bubbles, and 
Rastus was apparently asleep. 
Not a ripple on the swamp stirred 
as we made our way along the po- 
rous, black-treacle, spongy track. I 
threw a large diamond from one of 
the bank meteorites in bis usual half 
mile area of ooze, but not even a 
tentacle showed. 

“Was that a diamond?” a major 
asked. 

“Yes,” I said. “No volue here of 
course. You can pick up a ton any- 
where in the outer periphery.” 
Someone mentioned there was re- 
serve energy in the general’s ship 
and we could use the levitators. We 
wore ours more from habit than for

flight; we were always short of 
poww. 

**Oood old Kalen,” I 
“With energy on his ship. I wonder 
if we can whip a generator or two 
before he goes.” 

We sailed back to camp over the 
grass and the hroiken, dead trees and 
arrived at the same time as the 
transporter. I invited them all to 
coffee in the H.Q. I wanted to see 
KaJen without his headgear. He 
looked the sort of general that all 
generals try to look like. Clipped 
mustache; bright, steely eyes; lan- 
tern jaw; creases down either cheek 
so deep his Roman nose jutted like 
a letter L in brackets. He sat with 
his back bolt upright. A strain, I 
thought, on the belly that nature had 
built to sag a little. Natascha brought 
coffee, and the bright eyes mapped 
her contours with battlefield pre- 
cision. 

“Hem!” he said. “Er — yes. 
Hem!” 

“Natascha Kaminskaya,” I mtro- 
duced. “Originally, when we all came 
togeliher as a team about seventy- 
five years ago, our medical officer. 
Now our phagocytes cope with any- 
thing, and she only has an occasional 
broken leg to slip in the autosettcr. 
She’s become our universal femme 
fatale. We share her. On a strictly 
rota basis of course,” The military, 
I remembered, are always impressed 
by rotas. 

“It’s fun,” Natascha told him. 

“It must be,” he murmured. He 
rose to his full height and stroked 
his mustache. Inclining his head, he 
gestured me to follow him to a point 
away from the others secluded be- 



hind aa applied atmo^here geo^a- 
tor. 

“b she all Slight?” he asked. 

“Marvelous,” I said. “You want to 
slip in on the iota?” 

“I mean,” he enapped, “is she all 
i%ht poMcaflly? She appeals to be 
a Russtam” 

“Is she?” I wasn’t at all sure about 
Russia. It was the had half ’of some 
planet or other, hut I had forgotten 
which. 

“And then,” he went on, “that 
chap whh die suckers sprouting out 
of his shoulders. Where exactly is 
he from? You can’t be too careful, 
you know.” 

“Ingles?” Where had we found 
Ingles? Somewhere down Earth way 
— Barnard’s Star perhaps. “Ingles 
is one of the best,” I said. “You 
should see him dicing — hands 
against sudeexs. He is quite schizo- 
phrenic. The sudeers belong to the 
older half of his development, and 
they’re controlled by an antique 
corner of his brain. No connection 
with the humanoid that runs his 
hands. At ati his games, the hands 
win.” 

Natascha was han^ng round the 
coffee we always laced with a YK 
61 rum we had brought along in a 
tanker. Ingles was already raising 
his beaker. A reflective sip when 
the hands held it and a long gulp 
when the suckers took their turn. 
The sight of it seemed to trigger off 
some reaction in the general’s adre- 
nal-sympathico system. He snatched 
a beaker from Natascha^ drew him- 
self to his full height and cleared 
his throat. The aides snapped to at- 
tention. He raised his ^ass appar-

ently in invocation to the genius 
loci. \ 

“The president!” he bawled. 

“The president!” the aides echoed 

“Who is president of where now?” 
Ingles whispered. I twitched an eye- 
brow, and he subsided. I hadn’t the 
least idea. Presidents came and went. 
The drill, I took it, was to toast the 
idea of an office rather than an per- 
son. Everyone, everywhere drinks to 
something they believe the giver of 
all things good. We often toast 
Natascha. Why not a president? It 
was all the same to me. 

The general sat and extended his 
legs to their full length resting on the 
heels of his high, brown leather 
boots. He thought it time to un- 
bend, to show himself benignly hu- 
man like the rest of us with a big 
heart under the Sam Browne belt. 
But he was cautious. He wasn’t that 
sure of us yet. 

Ctnpell me,” he asked. “What ex- 
A actly is the military position?” 

“The military position,” I said, “is 

— well — myself. The rest of us 
here are sort of civilians. We had 

— I think you call them soldiers — 
in fair numbers when we set out. 
Somehow they all succumbed, and 
the civilians survived. The heroes, if 
I remember rightly, went first, then 
the not-so-heroic and so on down 
the scale to me. We set out original- 
ly to look for — what was it?” 

“Titanium ore.” Karlsen said. 

“Zirconium!” Spandrell thought. 

“What’s zirconium?” Ingles asked. 

“There wasn’t any.” I completed. 

“I was referring,” General Kalen 
said slowly, “to the strategic position 



of your encampment and the de- 
ployment of the enemy forces. Who 
or what is, in fact, responsible for 
the bubbles you call, rather oddly, 
the bombardment?” 

“Oh, those,” I told him. “That’s 
the goons.” 

“And who or what are the 
goons?” 

“We don’t exactly know. They 
live, we believe, on the other side of 
the marshes.” 

“And what kind of creatures are 
they?” 

“Anthropoid!” Karlsen snapped. 

“Humanoid!” Ingles almost agreed 
with him. 

“Duodecapods!” Ngomo shouted. 

It was the old argument. Only 
humanoids would want to play with 
that sort of energy, and only duode- 
capods would know how to. 

“We don’t know,” I explained. 
“We’ve never seen one. Their whole 
territory is encased in a kind of bub- 
ble, miles across, very likely made of 
the same energy substance as their 
missiles. You can’t fly through it; 
metal dissolves on contact with it and 
generates considerable heat. You can 
see through it, but it’s like looking 
at the sea-bed with a light swell 
running. It’s rippling and distorted. 
Every morning at second dawn, the 
wind rises, and pieces of bubble ap- 
pear to detach themselves from the 
main structure and float down here 
looking for us. That’s goon bombard- 
ment. We think the bubbles may be 
sentient.” 

“How big an area have you pros- 
pected so far?” 

“Only our camp under the chain- 
link dome and the air strip.”

IF 




“Is that all?” 

“It’s big enough. The rest of the 
planet is dead. Marsh and swamp 
and the goon bubble. Everything 
died a long time ago except . 

“Marsh and swamp!” Waldron 
shrieked. 

I had forgotten. We never men- 
tioned the swamp in his presence. 
He tihrew a fit and sobbed. The gen- 
eral treated us all to a long, cold 
look. He seemed not to like what he 
saw. The aides were writing rapidly 
in their notebooks, and a major tech- 
nologist was walking curiously 
around our equipment, showing inter- 
est in a spiral of copper tubing in a 
stainless steel vat. It looked like — 
and it was — a still. 

“The titanium ore,” the general 
asked slowly. “The spectrograph 
showed titanium. Have you really 
prospected for it?” 

“Have we?” I asked my staff. 

“The titaniuim is in goon territory,” 
Karlsen came to my rescue. “Under 
the bubble.” 

“In the swamp!” Waldron giggled. 
He screamed again. 

“What’s titanium?” Ingles asked. 

“Note this!” the general an- 
nounced. His aides raised their pen- 
cils and gathered around him. “In 
all my experience, I have never visit- 
ed a station so — strangely — con- 
ducted as this. The light-years be- 
tween your colony and Earth are no 
excuse for an absence of discipline — 
of objective — even, it appears, of 
mental balance.” He looked at Wal- 
dron. “You have been here five 
years ...” 

“Two!” Karlsen interrupted. 

“I refer,” the general snapped. 



“to the accepted reckoning in all 
civilized stations. That is, in Earth 
years. Earth time has a mystic, 
transcendental significance. It is ab- 
solute, true cosmic time. The length 
of your day and the duration of the 
VX91/6 orbit around its parents 
VX90 and 91 are irrelevant to this 
true time, and I repeat therefore that 
in five years you have succeeded in 
achieving precisely nothing. You 
have been together, you say, for 
seventy-five years, and you must all 
be in the region of two hundred 
years old. An age of discretion. Of 
maturity even. What have you 
achieved on your previous missions?” 

“We’ve survived,” I said. “And 
that has been achievement in it- 
self.” 

“Utterly negative!” he snapped. 

“Positive from our point of view,” 

I countered. 

“I am a reasonable man,” he con- 
tinued. “I would accept failure 
brought about by insuperable ob- 
stacles. Alien predominance, for in- 
stance. But what are your aliens? 
What is their strength? You appear 
not to know. What meaures have 
you taken to defeat them? None at 
all that I can see. Where is the 
titanium? Where is the zirconium? 
Have you any idea of the cost to 
Earth of these types of survey mis- 
sions? They have to be paid for. 
They have to show a profit in the 
minerals shipped back to the mother 
planet. That way lies survival. True 
survival in the communal sense. A 
small planet the master of the uni- 
verse, the storehouse of all the 
treasures the universe can offer it. 
And how does Earth obtain these

treasures? By the self-sacrifice, gal-

should be inspired by the same sense

men to the moon.*’ He paiused and 
swaMowed two purple tablets. His 
eyes brightened, and the pupils con- 
tacted. 

“Well, Oarruthers?” he asked sour- 
ly. “And what explanation have you 
to offer?” 

1 looked round my staff. Karlsen, 
blond, bearded, hunched over his 
electronic paraphernalia. Spandrel, 
short and fat, biting his fingernails. 
Ingles, young, yellow and handsome, 
mustac^oed, easily erect, doing his 
best to appear battleworthy. Yellow 
hands on hips and shoulder tendrils 
coiled, Medusa-fashion, around his 
neck. It was Natascha, who came to 
the rescue. 

“I think Rastus would know about 
the goons and about the titanium. 
Rastus knows most things.” 

“Of course!” I agreed. “The gen- 
eral must certainly meet Rastus!” 

“I should ibe pleased to meet any- 
one,” he said stiffly, “who could give 
me a simple answer to a simple ques- 
tion.” He was watching Waldron 
crouched behind the distillery and 
sucking at a hip flask like a hungry 
calf at the udder. 

“That’s settled then,” I announced. 
“Shall we go right away, or will you 
have breakfast first? Hydroponic 
melons and imported protein? We 
usuaiy manage on the coffee.” 
“Oan’t you send for him?” the 



general asked. It was really laugh- 
able. How litde the higber^ups knew 
about the cosmos they commanded. 
Even Karlsen’s beard bobbed with 
suppressed amusement. Natascha 
took his arm maternally. Natascha 
could be very persuasive. 

“Come with us,” she said. “We 
will show you Rastus.” I nodded to 
Ingles, who opened the inner door 
of the airlock. 

“Just you and me and the colonel. 
General,” she said. “Rastus might 
not like a crowd.” 

He allowed us to fix his helmet 
and harness and lead him into the 
airlock. The aides sighed and sat. 

“Weapons?” he asked “Where are 
your weapons?” 

“We never carry any,” I told him. 
It had been Natascha’s idea. Natas- 
cha had said it was wrong to kill the 
natives of a new planet just because 
they were non-humanoid, frightful 
or strange. She had proved her point 
the first day we met Rastus. I want- 
ed to shoot at him; but Natascha had 
stopped me, and we had just stood 
and watched him unfoil. Looking 
back I think we had be«i braver 
than most heroes. Somehow, Rastus 
had understood. He was now very 
fond of Natascha, and we look on 
him as quite one of the family. 

It is just as well. He is quite in- 
vulnerable.

W e walked down to the swamp, 
Natascha chattering to the 
general and asking him what the

on tihe rota that night. The general 
seemed preoccupied and almost, for 
a general, ungallant. He said “Niet!” 
once or twice, using some language 
which, if we had ever known it, we 
had long forgotten. Natascha took it 
as affirmative and said, how nice 
and she would tell Ingles. 1 thought 
1 saw his antennae twitch. 

“Well?” he said, when we reached 
the bank. 

“We are somewhere about the 
center of him,” she said. “I’ll call 
him up.” She stirred the ooze with 
her foot and called “Rastus!” 

The effect was, to the uninitiated, 
quite remarkable. As far as the eye 
could see, to right and left of us, 
the swamp began to stir and eddy as 
Rastus’s mileTong tentacles twitched 
and their extremities with the little 
mouths with the extra-retinal percep- 
tion opened and closed. One of 
them — we had never been sure 
how many there were — sensed her 
presence, arched up into the sky 
and then plunged downwards to 
stroke her faceshield. 

“Darling!” she cooed. 

The general sat without a mur- 
mur on a petrified log while two 
extra-retinal mouths looked him 
over. They snapped menacingly un- 
til Natascha put an arm round him, 
when the tentacles linked themselves 
in a knot apd the mouths looked at 
each other in the tongue. 

“What is it?” he asked. 

“We don’t quite know,” I told him. 
“We’ve never seen all of him. He’s 
quite a boy, isn’t he?” I felt a kind 
of proprietary pride in Rastus, like 
a suburban householder with a liver 
and white Great Dane. 



“He’s — this — knows about the 
bubbles, the titanium, the goons?” he 
asked. 

“Til ask him,” she said. “Rastus!” 
She cooed. “The bubbles. The round 
things.” She made circular gestures 
with her arms and pursed her lips, 
puffing inside her helmet. 

The three mouths unwound and 
studied her, swaying rhythmically 
from side to side. I drew bubbles 
with the heel of my boot in the 
spongy soil. I surrounded' them with 
radial lines like the rising suns’ rays. 
I didn’t know how to draw titanium. 

The whole performance must have 
puzzled Rastus, because for the first 
time in two years — our time — 
the whole of him emerged. We had 
never seen his head before. In fact, 
we had wondered if he had a head, 
since he seemed to manage so well 
without one. It came up now like 
the rock of Gibraltar, and, to Natas- 
cha’s delight, he had a real eye in 
addition to the light-sensitive mouths. 
It was about the size of the average 
radiotelescope bowl and would have 
fitted nicely into the circle of Stone- 
henge. The iris was purple, and the 
pupil deep jet black. It was a friend- 
ly, intelligent and highly perceptive 
eye. 

“Rastus, you’re beautiful,” Natas- 
cha whispered. I don’t think he knew 
the words she used, but like a petted 
dog, he gathered the gist of the 
sound and inference. A lid, like the 
dome of Saint Paul’s tilting, came 
down out of the rocky mountain of 
head, and the green-black hue of the 
bulbous undercarriage and the sup- 
{X)rting tentacles, twenty-five of 
them, turned slightly salmon-pink. 



98 



IF 




Rastus, all two miles of him, was 
blushing. 

“The bubbles, Rastus!” I asked 
him, since he seemed rapidly to be 
getting the significance of words. 
“What do we do about the bubbles?” 

T he head tilted forward, and the 
great eye hung above us, watch- 
ing as we gestured, and drew pic- 
tures. Then he seemed to understand. 

Three tentacles whipped from un- 
der him, circled our waists and whisk- 
ed us skyward to a height of abo-ut 
half a mile. We could see the bubble 
of the goons clearly in the light of 
the rising suns. We could also see, 
what we had long suspected, that 
apart from the dome and our own 
encampment the planet from horizon 
to horizon was flat and dead, a 
world where only the yellow marsh 
grass waved around the black ooze 
oif the swamps. Rastus held us aloft 
until we had seen all there was to 
see, and then the whole of him be 
gan to move. By contracting his for- 
ward tentacles and extending those 
at the rear, he swept us toward the 
dome. At their full extent, he drew 
the hind ones in beneath him and 
extended the leaders a full half mile 
outwards and repeated the process. 
In two minutes we were swaying 
hi^'h above the dome. 

“What now?” I asked. 

He uncoiled a longer and thicker 
tentacle from somewhere in the folds 
of his bulbous belly and thrust it in- 
to the surface to the bubble. 

“He’s charging his batteries!” 
Natascha shouted from a long way 
off on her far tentacle. There could 
be no doubt that that was exact- 



ly the idea of the process. Rastus 
lived on energy. (We had once won- 
dered why he had shown no interest 
in living on us.) And the bubble was 
in some way an energy contains 
formed by the action of the binary 
on the energy gas of the atmosphere. 
It all became clear to me. The effect 
of this feeding on Rastus was quite 
significant. He rfeally came to life. 
He danced, hopping from tentacle to 
tentacle, his great eye sparkling and 
glinting, the lid sliding up and down 
and the pupil contracting to the pin- 
point of a cartwheel. At last, ap- 
parantly satisfied, he withdrew the 
connector tentacle with a loud crack- 
le and, as the dome closed over the 
fracture, small balloons of energy 
dislodged and floated downwind to- 
ward our encampment. 

We had found the origin of goon 
bombardment. There remained only 
to account for the dawn wind. We 
had not long to wait. 

Attracted probably by the explo- 
sive crackling of the disrupted en- 
ergy surface, other giant shapes rose 
from the swamps around the dome. 
They plunged their tentades Through 
its surface; its area shrank still fur- 
ther, and the charged monsters be- 
came animated. Soon, as far as we 
could see, the whole planet was alive 
with dancing mountains of squid- 
like shapes, and the wind rose howl- 
ing from the threshing of their sup- 
ple, sinuous, mile-long members. 
Then, one by one, they became calm- 
er, and, with a contraction of ten- 
tacle, they sank beneath the surface 
of their respective swamps. Only 
Rastus remained, holding us aloft, 
making sure we saw and under-

stood, tiien he, too, began to sink 
slowly downward toward the bub- 
bling blackness of his bog. 

“Not in the bog!” the general 
shouted. “Don’t let him drown us!” 

“Of course not,” Natascha 
snapiped, indignant at his lack of un- 
derstanding. “He wouldn’t hurt a 
fly.” 

He set us very gently on the bank, 
and for a moment towered above 
us, his great eye blinking at Natas- 
cha. 

“Isn’t he nice!” she said. 

T he general was laughing rather 
in the same cracked key that 
Waldron favored. He danced a clum- 
sy jib in his heavy boots. 

“The bank!” he said. “How sweet 
the moonlight sleeps upon it where 
the wild thyme grows.” 

Natascha mothered him, and we 
coaxed him back to the camp. There 
were nurses with medals on their 
white spacesuits in his ship, and they 
came demurely down the ladder and 
surrounded him. 

Back in the H.Q., Karlsen started 
up the electro^mag accelerator. 

“Messages?” he asked the major 
who seemed to have slipped on the 
mantle of authority before anyone 
else had seen it fall. 

“No messages,” he said. “I think 
we’ll forget we ev.er came here. All 
the galaxy needs attention, and you 
can’t be everywhere. I think we’ll 
just slip away.” 

“Very wise,” I said. 

“I saw that thing from your look- 
out tower,” he confided. 

We gave him a coffee and a hy- 
droponic melon. 



“You lot want a posting home?” 
He asked. We had always talked 
about postings home. We had grown 
so used to supposing that that was 
what we wanted, we had never real- 
ly thought about it. To have the op- 
portunity suddenly rolled off the cuff 
like that caught me quite unprepared. 

“Home?” I asked. “Where’s 
home?” 

“Earth, of course,” he said. 

That was it, of course. The place 
we always referred to when we want- 
ed a good simile. 

“Do we?” I asked them. They 
had their memories too. 

“Commuting to space H.Q. on a 
wet Monday,” Spandrel groaned. 

“Presidents and generals and 
bombs and political broadcasts.” 

“People everywhere,” Karlsen re- 
membered. 

“What are people?” Ingles asked. 

“What about Ingles?” I asked the 
major, playing for time. 

“He can go back to his own plan- 
et. He might get on to Earth if he 
passes the vetting.” 

“Vet Ingles?” I asked. 

Natascha came down the ladder 
from the single upper-floor but we 
had built for her. The plain round 
walls of our beehive with its junk 
and clobber never seemed dull or 
sordid when Natascha was there. 

“Shall we go home, Natascha?” I 
asked her. We all knew it was her 
decision really. 

“We couldn’t leave Rastus,” 
Natascha decided. That settled it. 

I heard later they made the ma- 
jor a general first class. Experience 
does a lot for a man. But we never 
found any titanium. END

Watch those toys your children

Gentlemen, 

It is a disgrace that any toy company should put on the 
market such a toy, supposedly for children, as your “Interstellar 
Secret Agent Kit.” 



In your 3-D family entertainment commercials, which you 
broadcast (by actual count) 317 times daily, you recommend this kit 
for children of six years and older. Outrageous! 



101 





You will shortly be hearing from my lawyers; for, thanks to 
my purchase of your “Interstellar Secret Agent Kit” for my young 
son, my wife has suffered a nervous 'breakdown, and our entire fam- 
ily is severely disrupted. I intend to sue you for ten billion credits 
for medical expenses for my wife, her psychiatric care, loss of her 
companionship, etc.y etc.y as well as many other minor claims which 
my lawyers will enumerate at length. 

In hopes that you will IMMEDIATELY withdraw this 
alleged toy from the market, I shall give you a detailed report on my 
family’s unhappy experiences with the “Interstellar Secret Agent Kit.” 

I purchased it at Tricky Jack’s Super-Discount Subcellar (“We buy and 
sell down close to Hell”) for 1,007 credits (discount price). I wasn’t 
about to pay your list price of 4,998 credits, which is out-and-out 
robbery for such a piece of junk. My son hadn’t had the kit more than 
an hour, when the handle came off the genuine imitation Betelgeuse 
immy-skin attache case. 

The instructions for use of the kit were in code, which defied 
me; but my son (age 7) mastered it in no time. He said it was an 
ancient dead language, Igpay Atinlay, which is all the rage at school. 
Some wise apple slipped a tape of itiinto the hypno learner, and they 
all had it down pat before the teaching machine caught the error. 

The first thing my son did was to try out the Scary Scarab 
Scalper, that nasty little electronic gadget which looks like a cross 
between a beetle and a midget lobster. He wound it up and turned it 
loose, when his mother was in the room. Luckily she ducked as it 
hummed over her head, so that it didn’t actually scalp her — it just 
shaved her head. 

We had invited my boss to dinner, and she didn’t have time 
to send out for a wig; so sonny came to the rescue with one of the 
disguises from that dreadful kit. How was my wife to know that it was 
a Medusa wig? She’d just put it on, when the door speaker announced 
that our ‘guests had arrived. When she went to greet my boss, he took 
one look at those snaky locks and was turned to stone. Now I’m out of 
a job, and we’re the unhappy possessors of a new, grotesque piece of 
statuary. (His wife wouldn’t have it — said she’d warned her husband 
that the very next time he got stoned at a party, she’d lock him out 
of his cubicle.) 



102 



IF 




Needless to say my loss of employment was a severe blow 
to my wife’s psyche, as we owe on the 3-D Home Entertainment Centeir, 
the Aircar and the Readi-Meal Servo-unit. The Readi-meal Corporation 
discontinued service when we lost our credit rating, and my wife had 
to learn how to add water to freeze-dried foods, a skill her mother 
never taught her. 

Naturally we scolded sonny; so he promised to be more care- 
ful with the kit in the future and not direct its diabolical contents at 
humans. This is what caused all the trouble with our Sirian cat*. You 
know how valuable these imported felines are; not only because of their 
large size and metallic fur, but also because of their extremely gentle 
nature. Many people employ them as baby-watchers. Ours, Baby Umtid- 
dledy Pinkums, a female, was scheduled to be bred to Feline Champion 
Tomas Tigre. And the kittens would have gone for 3,000 credits each. 
We were keeping Pinkums locked in her cage, which turned out to be 
a mistake; for the lock inspired my son to try the Electronic Lxx:k- 
Picking Tool in the Secret Agent Kit. I suppose your company should 
be congratulated on the fact that this part of the toy worked as 
advertised — too well. Pinkums got out and headed for the cubicle door. 
Just then a visitor arrived. It was my teenage daughter’s nauseating 
boyfriend, who let the cat out. 

As Pinkums was streaking through the crack in the door, my 
son sprayed her with the Aphrodisiac Atomizer from his Secret Agent 
Kit. Before we got the cat back into our cubicle, she’d met a common 
alley cat that was wandering about on the sidewalk. Now who in his 
right mind, may I ask, wants a half-Sirian, half-alleycat kitten? Not 
only will no one pay 3,000 credits apiece for the kittens, but also we’ll 
probably have to pay p>eople to take them off our hands, as the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Aliens Act prevents our drowning them. 

This was very unnerving to my wife, who had already spent 
most of the credits for the as yet unconceived Sirian kittens. This, too, 
was a conditioning factor in her breakdown. 

The thing which really caused my wife to flip, though, was 
what happened to our daughter’s boyfriend. Let’s face it, our daughter 
is no raving beauty. In fact, she’s homely as a Vegan milligual, and 
homelier than that you don’t get. This fellow who has been dating her 
is one big mess; but my wife argued that he was male and eligible, and 



THE SPY GAME

we mustn’t lcx)k gift spouses in the mouth, even if he did paint his 
face blue with that new cosmetic: and play the latest cosmic discords on 
his molecular harpskar. 

Well, my son never liked Blueboy; so forgetting his promise 
about humans, he took the miniature blow pipe, which is disguised as 
a cancer-free cigarette, and got the boyfriend right between the eyes 
with the poison dart from the Secret Agent Kit. Pretty good shooting 
for a seven-year-old, if you ask me; but his mother didn’t see it that 
way. She blamed me for buying the Kit for our son, and proceeded 
to punish me by; having a nervous breakdown. (Otherwise I’d have 
been able to report to you that at least ONE good thing had come 
out of my purchase.) For a while, I was afraid that Blu^boy’s parents 
would sue me; but when I agreed to pay the exorbitant fee for having 
his body blasted off into the Cemetery Orbit, they were satisfied. 

Frankly, I think they’re glad to have him off their hands. This added 
expense was the clincher in my decision to sue your company. 

Yours in litigation, 

^ Sean Quentin O’Publick 

P.S. As a final affront to my already battered sensibilities, I find that 
I’m not very skilled at preparing meals from freeze-dried packages, either.

woman. “It makes sense. Tham, 
with its humanoids living in the 
equivalent of Earth’s Middle Ages. 
Grollor, with just the beginnings of 
an industrial culture. Mellise, with 
its intelligent amphibians and no 
industries, no technology at all. Our 
mutant friends must have found the 
people of all those worlds a push- 
over.

What Has Gone Before — 

Out of nowhere a strange spaceship appeared in the solar system. Il 
was no ship that man had ever built . • . but its name was scratched on its 
hull in English letters, even though the spelling was strange and unfamiliar, and 
its crew was human. But what humansi They were dressed in rags. Their bodies 
bore the marks of privation and torture. And — they were, every last one of 
them, dead. 

Analysis revealed that the ship was not merely from another star, but 
from another universe entirely, thrust into our own by some catastrophic distor- 
tion of its Mannschen Drive field. But if one such could come by accident, others 
might follow by design — and the creatures that had built the ship and so 
maltreated its humans would not be welcome guests. So a human crew — 
Grimes, his wife Sonya, a picked crew of volunteers — manned the alien craft 
and in it thrust themselves through the dimensional wall into the other universe 
. to find their enemy and destroy himl 



“But Stree ,,, We don’t know 
just what powers — psychic? psionic? 
— those philosophical lizards can 
muster, and we’re on friendly terms 
with them. So — ” 

“So we might get help there,” said 
Grimes. “It’s worth considering. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Mayhew, has there 
been any communication with the 
anti-matter worlds to the Galactic 
West?” 

“No, sir.” 

Grimes smiled — but it was a 
cold smile. ‘Then this is, without 
doubt, a matter for the Confederacy. 
The legalities of it all are rather fasci- 
nating.” 

“The illegalities. Skipper,” said 
Williams. “But I don’t mind being a 
pirate in a good cause.” 

“You don’t mind being a pirate. 
Period,” said Sonya. 



“Too bloody right I don’t. It 
makes a change.” 

“Shall we regard ourselves as 
liberators?” asked Grimes — but it 
was more an order than a question. 
“Meanwhile, Commander Williams, 
I suggest that we set course for 
Stree. And you, Mr. Mayhew, main- 
tain your listening watch. Let me 
know at once if there are any other 
vessels in our vicinity — even though 
they haven’t Mass Proximity Indi- 
cators they can still pick up our 
temporal precession field and syn- 
chronize.” 

“And what are your intentions 
when you get to Stree, sir?” asked 
the Major. 

“As I told the Admiral, I play by 
ear.” He unstrapped himself from 
his chair and, closely followed by 
Sonya, led the way to the control 



106 



IF 




room. He secured himself in his seat 
and watched Williams as the Com- 
mander went through the familiar 
routine of setting course — Manns- 
ohenn Drive off, directional gyros- 
copes brought into play to swing the 
ship -to her new heading, the target 
star steadied in the cartwheel sight, 
the brief burst of power from the 
lieaction drive. Mannschenn Drive 
eut in again. The routine was fam- 
iliar, and the surroundings in which 
it was carried out were familiar, but 
he still found it hard to adjust to the 
near nudity of himself and his of- 
ficers. But Williams, with only three 
bands of indigo dye on each thick, 
hairy wrist to mark his rank, was 
doing the job as efficiently as he 
would have done had those bands 
been gold braid on black cloth. 

“On course. Skipper,” he an- 
nounced. 

“Thank you. Commander Wil- 
liams. All off-duty personnel may 
stand down. Maintain normal deep 
space watches.” Accompanied by his 
wife, he returned to his quarters. 

I t was, at first and in some respects, 
just another voyage. 

In the Mannschenn Drive Room 
the complexity of spinning gyros- 
copes precessed, tumbled, quivered 
on the very edge of invisibility, pull- 
ing the ship and all her people with 
them down the dark dimensions, 
through the warped continuum, 
down and along the empty immensi- 
ties of the rim of space. 

But, reported Mayhew, they were 
not alone. There were other ships, 
fortunately distant, too far away for 
Freedom* s wake through Space-Time 



to register on their instruments. 

It was more than just another voy- 
age. Hiere was the hate and the fear 
with which they were surrounded, 
said Mayhew. He, of course, was 
listening only — the other operators 
were sending. There were warships 
in orbit about Lorn, Faraway, Ulti- 
mo and Thule, there were squadrons 
hastening to take up .positions off 
Tham, Mellise, Grollor and Stree. 
And the orders to single vessels and 
to fleets were brutally simple: Des~ 
troy on sight, 

“What else did you expect?” said 
Sonya, when she was told. 

“I thought,” said Grimes, “that 
they might try to capture us.” 

“Why should they? As far as they 
know we’re just a bunch of escaped 
slaves who’ve already tried their 
hand at piracy. In any case, I should 
hate to be captured by those . 
things.” 

“Xenophobia from yoUy of all peo- 
ple?” 

“No. Not xenophobia. Real aliens 
one can make allowances for. But 
these aren’t real aliens. They’re a 
familiar but dangerous pest, a feared 
and hated pest that’s suddenly started 
fighting us with our own weapons. 
We have never had any cause to 
love them — human beings have 
gotten, at times, quite sentimental 
over mice, but never rats — and 
they’ve never had any cause to love 
us. A strong, mutual antipathy . 
Absently she rubbed the fading scar 
between her breasts with her strong 
fingers. 

“What do you make of this 
squadron despatched to Stree?”

“A precautionary measure. They 
think that we might be making for 
there, and that they might be able to 
intercept us when we emerge into 
normal spacetime. But according to 
Mayhew there have been no psionic 
messages to planetary authorities, as 
there have been to the military 
governments on' Tharn, Mellise and 
Grollor.” She said, a note of query 
in her voice, “We shall make it be- 
fore they do?” 

“I think so. I hope so. Our 
Mannschenn Drive unit is running 
flat out. It’s pushed to the safety 
limits. And you know what will hap- 
pen if the governor packs up.” 

“I don’t know,” she told him. “No- 
body knows. I do know most of the 
spacemen’s fairy stories about what 
might happen.” 

“Once you start playing around 
with Time, anything might happen,” 
he said. “The most important thing 
is to be able to take advantage of 
what happens.” 

She grinned. “I think I can guess 
what’s flitting through your apology 
for a mind.” 

“Just an idea,” he said, “Just an 
idea. But I’d like to have a talk 
with those saurian philosophers be- 
fore I try to do anything about it.” 

“If we get there before that squad- 
ron,” she ‘said. 

“If we don’t, we may try out the 
idea before we’re ready to. But I 
think we’re still leading the field.” 

“What’s that?” she demanded. 

That was not a noise. That was 
something that is even more disturb- 
ing in any pK>wered ship traversing 
any medium — a sudden cessation 
of noise.The buzzer that broke the 



tense silence was no proper substi- 
tute for the thin, high keening of the 
Mannschenn Drive. 

It was the officer of the watch, 
calling from Control. “Commodore, 
sir, O.O.W. here. Reporting break- 
down of interstellar drive.” 

Grimes did not need to be told. 
He had experienced the uncanny 
sensation of temporal disorientatioif 
when the precessing gyroscopes slow- 
ed, ceased to precess. He said, 
“Don’t bother the engineers — 
every second spent answering the 
telephone means delay in effecting 
repairs. I’ll be right up.” 

“Looks as though our friends 
might beat us to Siree after all,” 
remarked Sonya quietly. 

“That’s what I’m afraid of,” said 
Grimes. 

XVI 

T he breakdown of Freedom's 
Mannschenn Drive unit was a 
piece of bad luck — but. Grimes 
admitted, the luck could have been 
much worse. 

The ship h^d made her re-entry 
into the normal continuum many 
light-years from any focal point and 
well beyond the maximum range of 
the radar installations of the enemy 
war vessels. She had space — or, 
at any rate, a vast globe of emptiness 
— all to herself. 

The odds had been in favor of her 
finding herself in just this situation 
— but, as an amateur of naval his - 
tory, Grimes knew full well what an 
overly large part is played by sheer, 
blind mischance in warfare. Far too 
many times a hunted ship has blun- 



108 



IF 




deted into the midst of her pursuers 
when all on board have considered 
themselves justified in relaxing their 
vigilance — not that vigilance is of 
great avail against overwhelming fire- 
power. And firepower, whether it 
be the muzzle-loading cannon of the 
days of sail or the guided missiles 
and laser beams of today, is what 
makes the final decision. 

But, so far, there was no need to 
worry about firepower. A good look- 
out, by all available means, was of 
primary importance. And so, while 
Freedom fell — but slowly, slowly, 
by the accepted standards of inter- 
stellar navigation — toward the dis- 
tant Stree sun, the long fingers of 
her radar pulses probed the empti- 
ness about her and, in the cubby 
hole that he shared with the naked 
canine brain that was a poor and 
untrained substitute for his beloved 
Lassie, Mayhew listened, alert for 
the faintest whisper of thought that 
would offer some clue as to the en- 
emy’s whereabouts and intentions. 

After a while, having received no 
reports from the engineers. Grimes 
went along to the Mannschenn Drive 
Room. He knew that the engineroom 
staff was working hard, even des- 
perately, and that the buzz of a tele- 
phone in such circumstances can be 
an almost unbearable irritation. Even 
so, as captain of the ship he felt that 
he was entitled to know what was 
going on. 

He stood for a while in the door- 
way of the compartment, watching. 
He could see what had happened — 
a seized bearing of the main rotor. 
That huge flywheel, in the gravita- 
tional field of an Earth-type planet, 



would weigh at least five tons. Even 
with Freedom falling free, it still 
possessed considerable mass. Its 
spindle had to be eased clear of the 
damaged bearing — and great care 
had to be taken that it did not come 
into contact with and damage the 
smaller gyroscopes surrounding it. 

Finally Bronson, the Chief En- 
gineer, pausing to wipe his sweat- 
ing face, noticed the Commodore 
and delivered himself of a complaint. 

“We should have installed one of 
our own units, sir.” 

“Why, Conmiander?” 

“Because ours have a foolproof 
system of automatic lubrication, 
that’s why. Because the idiots who 
built this ship don’t seem to have 
heard of such a thing. They must 
rely on their sense of smell to warn 
them as soon as anything even starts 
to run hot.” 

“And that’s possible,” murmured 
Grimes, thinking that the mutants 
had not been intelligent long enough 
for their primitive senses to become 
dulled. Then he asked, “How long 
will you be?” 

“At least two hours. At least. 
That’s the best I can promise you.” 
“Very good.” He paused. “And 
how long will it take you to modify 
the lubrication system, to bring it up 
to our standards?” 

“I haven’t even thought about that. 
Commodore. But it’d take days.” 
“We can’t afford the time,” said 
Grimes, as much to himself as to the 
engineer. “Just carry on with the 
repairs to the main rotor and let me 
know as soon as the unit is opera- 
tional. I shall be in Control.” As he 
turned to go he added, half serious- 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



109 




ly, “And it might be an idea to see 
that your watohkeepers possess a 
keen sense of smell.” 

B ack in the control room he felt 
more at home, even though this 
was lihe nerve center of a crippled 
ship. Officers sat at their posts, and 
there was the reassuring glow from 
the screens of navigational instru- 
ments — the chart tank and the 
radarscopes. Space, for billions of 
miles on every hand, was still emp- 
ty, which was just as well. 

He went to stand by Sonya and 
Williams, told them what he had 
learned. 

“So they beat us to Stree,” com- 
mented the Executive Officer glum- 

ly- 

“I’m afraid that they will, Com- 
mander.” 

“And then what do we do?” 

“I wish I knew just what the situ- 
ation is on Stree,” murmured 
Grimes. ''They don’t seem to have 
taken over, as they have on the other 
Rim Worlds. Should we be justified 
in breaking through to make a land- 
ing?” 

‘Trying to break through, you 
mean,” corrected Sonya. 

“All right. Trying to break 
through. Will it be a justified risk?” 
“Yes,” she said firmly. “As far 
as I can gather from Mayhew, our 
rodent friends are scared of Stree 
and its people. They’ve made con- 
tact, of course, but that’s all. The 
general feeling seems to be one of 
you leave us alone and we’ll leave 
you alone.” 

“I knew the Streen,” said Grimes. 
“Don’t forget that it was I that made 



the first landing on their planet, 
when I opened up the Eastern Cir- 
cuit to trade. They’re uncanny 
brutes — but, after all, mammals 
and saurians have little in common, 
psychologically speaking.” 

“Spare us the lecture, John. Fur- 
thermore, while you were nosing 
around in the engineroom, Mayhew 
rang control. He’s established con- 
tact with the squadron bound for 
Stree.” 

“What! Is the man mad? Send for 
him at once.” 

“Quietly, John, quietly. Our Mr. 
Mayhew may be a little round the 
bend, like all his breed, but he’s no 
fool. When I said that he had made 
contact with the enemy I didn’t 
mean that he had been nattering with 
the officer commanding the squad- 
ron. He’s made contact with the 
underground.” 

“Don’t talk in riddles!” 

“Just a delaying action, my dear, 
to give you time to simmer down. 

I didn’t want you to order that 
Mayhew be thrown out of the airlock 
without a spacesuit. The under- 
ground, as I have referred to it, is 
made up of the human brains that 
our furry friends use as psionic amp- 
lifiers.” 

“But it’s still criminal folly. They 
will employ telepaths as psionic ra- 
dio officers, just as we do. And 
those telepaths will read the thoughts 
of their amplifiers, just as Mayhew 
reads the thoughts of his dog’s brain 
in aspic.” 

“But will they? Can they? Don’t 
forget that our telepaths employ as 
amplifiers the brains of creatures 
considerably less intelligent than 



110 



IF 




Man. Whoever heard of a dog with 
any sort of mental screen? They 
will be using the brains of humans 
who have beea unlucky enough to 
be bom with telepathic ability. And 
any human telepath, any trained hu- 
man telepath, is able to set up a 
screen.” 

C4T)ut why should They use hu- 
man brains? The risk of 
sabotage of vital communications — ” 
“What other brains are available 
for their use? As far as They are 
concerned, both dogs and cats are 
out, repeat out.” 

“Why?” 

“Far too much mutual antipathy.” 
“Wouldn’t that also apply in the 
case of themselves and human be- 
ings?” 

“No. I doubt if they really hate us. 
After all, we have provided their 
ancestors with food, shelter and 
transportation for many centuries. 
The rats would have survived if they 
hadn’t had the human race to bludge 
upon, but they wouldn’t have flour- 
ished, as they have, traps and poisons 
notwithstanding. Oh, all right. With 
the exception of the occasional small 
boy with 'his albino pets, every hu- 
man being has this hatred of rats. 
But hate isn’t the only mainspring 
of human behavior.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Look at it this way. Suppose 
you’re a telepath, born on one of the 
Rim Worlds in this continuum. By 
the time that your talent has been 
noted, by the time that you’re . 
conscripted, you will have come to 
love your parents and the other mem- 
bers of your family. You will have 



made friends outside the family cir- 
cle. Without being overly precocious 
you may even have acquired a lover.” 

“I think I see. Play ball, or else.” 

“Yes.” 

“Then why should the poor bas- 
tards risk the ‘or else’ now?” 

“Because Mayhew’s peddled them 
a line of goods. Very subtly, yeity 
carefully. Just induced dreams at 
first, just dreams of life as it is 
on the Rim Worlds in our Universe 
— but a somewhat glamorized ver- 
sion.” 

“I can imagine it. Mayhew’s a 
very patriotic Rim Worlder.” 

“First the dreams, and then the 
hints. The whisper that all that they 
have dreamed is true, that all of it 
could become the way of life of 
their own people. The story of what 
actually happened to Freedom and 
to the escaped slaves. The message 
that we have come to help them — 
and the request for help for our- 
selves.” 

“But I don’t understand how he 
could have done all this in so short a 
time.” 

“How long does a dream take? It 
is said that a man can dream of a 
lifetime’s happenings in a few sec- 
onds.” 

Already Grime’s active mind was 
toying with ideas, with ruses and 
stratagems. Deceit, he knew, has al- 
ways been a legitimate technique of 
warfare. Not that legalities counted 
for overmuch in this here-and-now. 
Or did they? If the Federation got 
dragged into the mess, he and his 
people might well find themselves 
standing trial for piracy. It was un- 
likely — but, bearing in mind the 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



m 




Federation’s pampering of various 
unpleasant nonhuman races on his, 
Grimes’s, time track, possible. 

He grinned. The legal aspects of 
it all were far too complicated — 
and, at the moment, far too unim- 
portant. 

He said, “Send for Mr. Mayhew 
immediately.” 

XVII 

G rimes went into conference with 
Mayhew and certain others of 
his officers. There was Sonya, of 
course, and there was Williams, and 
there was Dangerford, the Chief Re- 
action Drive Engineer. Also present 
was one Ella Kubinsky, who held 
the rank of Lieutenant in the Rim 
Worlds Volunteer Naval Reserve. 
She was not a spacewoman. She 
was a specialist officer, and in civilian 
life she was an instructor at the Uni- 
versity of Lorn, in the Department 
of Linguistics. Looking at her. 
Grimes could not help thinking that 
she was ideally suited for the part 
that she would be called upon to 
play. Her straggling hair was so pale 
as to be almost white, her chin and 
forehead receded sharply from her 
pointed nose. Her arms and legs 
were scrawny, her breasts meager. 
She had b^en nicknamed The White 
Rat. 

To begin with. Grimes and Sonya 
questioned Mayhew closely, with 
Sonya playing the major part in the 
interrogation. They wished that they 
could have subjected the bodiless hu- 
man telepaths aboard the enemy 
ships to a similar interrogation — 
but that, of course, was impossible. 



However, Mayhew said that they 
were sincere in their desire to help. 
And sincerity is almost impossible 
to simulate when you have thrown 
your mind open to another skilled, 
trained intelligence. 

Then other, less recondite matters 
were discussed with Williams and 
Dangerford. These concerned the 
efficacy of various detergents and 
paint removers and, also, the burn- 
ing off from the hull plating of cer- 
tain lettering and its replacement 
with other letters, these characters 
to be fabricated in the Engineers’ 
workshop by Dangerford and his 
juniors who, of course, were not in- 
volved in the repair work to the 
Mannschenn Drive unit. Mayhew 
was called upon to supply the speci- 
fications for these characters. 

And then tapes were played to 
Ella Kubinsky. These were records of 
signals received from the mutants’ 
ships. She repeated the words, imi- 
tating them in a thin, high, squeak- 
ing voice that exactly duplicated 
the original messages. 

Even Sonya expressed her satis- 
faction. 

While this was being done, May- 
hew retired to his cabin for further 
consultations with his fellow tele- 
paths. There was so much that they 
could tell him. There was so much 
that they knew, as all psionic signals 
had to pass through their brains. 
When he came back to Grimes’s 
cabin he was able to tell the Com- 
modore what name to substitute for 
both Freedom and Distriyir when 
these sets of characters had been 
removed from the forward shell plat- 
ing. 



112 



IF 




W hile Williams and his working 
party were engaged outside 
the ship, and Dangerford and his 
juniors were fabricating the new 
characters, Grimes, Sonya and Ella 
Kubinsky accompanied Mayhew to 
his quarters. It was more convenient 
there to rehearse and to be filled in 
with the necessary background de- 
tails. It seemed, at times, that the 
disembodied presences of the human 
psionic amplifiers were crowded 
with them into the cramped com- 
partment, bringing with them the 
mental stink of their hates and fears. 

It has been said that to know is 
to love. But very often to know is 
to hate. Those brains, bodiless, naked 
in their baths of nutrient solution, 
must know their unhuman masters 
as no intelligence clothed in flesh 
and blood could ever know them. 
And Grimes found himself pitying 
Mayhew’s own psionic amplifier, the 
brain of the dog that possessed nei- 
ther the knowledge nor the experi- 
ence to hate the beings who had de- 
prived it of a normal existence. 

Bronson had finished the repairs 
to the Mannschenn Drive before 
Williams and Dangerford were ready. 
He was glad enough to be able to 
snatch a brief rest before his ma- 
chinery was restarted. 

And then the new name was in 
place. 

Grimes, Sonya and Williams went 
back to Control where, using the 
public address system, the Commo- 
dore told his ship’s company of the 
plan for the landing on Stree. He 
sensed a feeling of disappointment. 
Carter, the Gunnery Officer, and the 
Major and his Marines had been 



looking forward to a fight. Well, 
they could be ready for one — but 
if ail went as plann^ they would not 
be getting it. 

Cirsir — Corsair — as she had 
been renamed set course for the 
Stree sun. The real Corsair had been 
unable to join the squadron, being 
grounded for repairs on Tham. The 
real Corsair^ s psionic amplifier knew, 
by this time, what was happening, 
but would not pass on the informa- 
tion to the unhuman psionic radio 
officer who was his lord and mas- 
ter. And the psionic amplifiers 
aboard the other ships would let it 
be known that Corsair was hastening 
to join the blockade of Stree. 

It was all so simple. The opera- 
tion, said Sonya, was an Intelligence 
Officer’s dream of Heaven — to 
know everything that the enemy was 
thinking, and to have full control 
over the enemy’s communications. 
The pseudo-Cori'a/V was in psionic 
touch with the squadron that she 
was hurrying to overtake. Messages 
were passing back and forth, mes- 
sages that, from the single ship, were 
utterly bogus and that, from the 
fleet, were full of important infor- 
mation. Soon Grimes knew every de-. 
tail of tonnage, manning and ar- 
mament — and knew that he must 
avoid any sort of showdown. There 
was enough massed firepower to 
blow his ship into fragments in a 
microsecond, whereupon the laser 
beams, in another microsecond, 
would convert those fragments into 
puffs of incandescent vapor. 

As Corsair closed the range the 
squadron ahead was detected on her 
instruments. The slight flickering of 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



113 





needles on the faces of gauges, the 
shallow undulation of the glowing 
traces in monitor tubes, showed that 
in the vicinity were other vessels us- 
ing the interstellar drive. They were 
not yet visible, of course, and would 
not be unless temporal precession 
rates were synchronized. And syn- 
chronization was what Grimes did 
not want. As far as he knew, his 
Corsair was typical of her class (as 
long as her damaged side was hidden 
from view). But the humans (if 
bodiless brains could still be called 
human) aboard the ships of the 
squadron were not spacemen. They 
knew nothing of subtle differences 
that can be picked up immediately 
by the trained eye. 

Grimes wished to be able to sweep 
past the enemy, invisible, no more 
than interference on their screens. 









and to make his landing on Stree 
before the blockading squadron fell 
into its orbits. That was his wish and 
hope; but Bronson, since the break- 
down, did not trust his Mannsohenn 
Drive unit and dared not drive the 
machine at its full capacity. He 
pointed out that, even so, they were 
gaining slowly upon the enemy, and 
that was evidence that the engineers 
of these vessels trusted their inter- 
stellar drives even less than he did. 
The Commodore was obliged to ad- 
mit that his engineer was probably 
right in this assumption. 

S o it was that when Corsair, at 
last, cut her Drive and re-enter- 
ed normal Space-Time the blockad- 
ing cruisers were already taking up 
their stations. Radar and radio came 
into play. From the transceiver in 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



115 



Corsair*s control room squeaked an 
irritable voice — ''Heenteer tee 
Ceerseer, Heenteer tee Ceerseer, 
teeke eep steeteen ees eerdeered.” 

Ella Kubinski, who had been 
thoroughly rehearsed for just this 
situation, squeaked the acknowledg- 
ment. 

Grimes stared out of the view- 
ports at the golden globe that was 
Stree, at the silver, flitting sparks 
that were the other ships. He switch- 
ed his regard to Williams, saw that 
the Executive Officer was going 
through the motions of maneuvering 
the ship into a closed orbit — and, 
as he had been ordered, making a 
deliberate botch of it. 

*'Heenteer tee Ceerseer. Whee ees 
neet yeer veeseen screen een?” 

Ella Kubinski squeaked that it was 
supposed to have been overhauled 
on Tharn, and added some unkind 
remarks about the poor quality of 
humanoid labor. Somebody — 
Grimes was sorry that he did not see 
who it was — whispered unkindly 
that if Ella did switch on the screen 
it would make no difference, any- 
how. The ugly girl flushed angrily, 
but continued to play her part calm- 
ly enough. 

Under Williams’ skilled handling 
the ship was falling closer and closer 
to the great, expanding globe of the 
planet. But .this did not go unnoticed 
for long. Again there was the en- 
raged squeaking, but in a new voice. 
“Thees ees thee Eedmeereel. Wheet

Ella told her story of an alleged 
overhaul of reaction drive controls 
and made further complaints about 



the quality of the dockyard labor on 
Tharn. 

“Wheere ees yee Ceepteen? Teel 
heem tee speek tee mee.” 

Ella said that the Captain was 
busy at the controls. The Admiral 
said that the ship would do better 
by herself than with such an illegiti- 
mate son of a human female, han- 
dling her. Williams, hearing this, 
grinned and muttered, “I did not 
ride to my parents* wedding on a 
bicycle.” 

“Wheere ees thee Ceepteen?” 

And there was a fresh voice. 
*‘"‘Heeveec tee Heenteer. Wheere deed 
shee geet theet deemeege?” 

“All right,” said Grimes. “Action 
stations. And get her downstairs, 
Williams, as fast as Christ will let 
you!” 

Gyroscopes whined viciously and 
rockets screamed, driving the ship 
down to the exosphere in a power- 
ed dive. From the vents in her sides 
puffed the cloud of metallic particles 
that would protect her from lasers — 
until the particles themselves were 
destroyed by the stabbing beams. 
And her launching racks spewed a 
covey of missiles, each programmed 
for random action, and to seek out 
and destroy any target except their 
parent ship. Not that they stood 
much chance of so doing — but 
they would, at least, keep the enemy 
laser gunners busy. 

C orsair hit the first, tenuous fring- 
es of the Streen atmosphere, and 
her internal temperature rose fast. 
Too fast. 

Somehow, using rockets only, tak- 
ing advantage of her aerodynamic

qualities, such as they were, Wil- 
liams turned her, stood her on her 
tail. Briefly she was a sitting duck — 
but Carter’s beams were stabbing 
and slicing, swatting down the swarm 
of missiles that had been loosed at 
her. 

She was falling then, stern first, 
falling fast but under control, bal- 
anced on her tail of incandescence, 
the rocket thrust that was slowing 
her — that would bring her to a 
standstill (Grimes hoped) when her 
vaned landing gear was only scant 
feet above the surface of the planet. 

She was dropping through the 
overcast — blue-silver at first, then 
gradually changing hue to gold. In 
the overcast there was no pursuit, 
although when she entered regions 
of denser atmosphere she was es- 
corted, surrounded by great, shadowy 
shapes that wheeled about them on 
wide wings and glared redly at them 
through the control room ports. 

Grimes recognized them. After all, 
in his own Continuum he had been 
the first human to set foot on Stree. 
They were the huge flying lizards, 
not unlike the pterosauria of Earth’s 
past — but in Grimes’s Space-Time 
they had never behaved like this. 
They had avoided spaceships and 
aircraft. 

These showed no inclination 
towards doing so. Just one of the 
huge brutes colliding with the ship, 
tipping her off balance, could easily 
produce a situation beyond even 
Wiliams’s superlative pilotage to 
correct. 

But they kept their distance, more 
or less, and followed Corsair down, 
down, through the overcast and 



through the clear air below the cloud 
blanket. And beneath her was the 
familiar landscape — low, rolling 
hills, broad rivers, lush green plains 
that were no more than wide clear- 
ings in the omnipresent jungle. 

Yes, it was familiar. The Com- 
modore could make out the site of 
his first landing — one of the smaller 
clearings that, by some freak of 
chance or nature, had the outline 
of a great horse. 

Inevitably, as he had been on the 
occasion of his first landing. Grimes 
was reminded of a poem that he had 
read as a young man, that he had 
tried to memorize — The Ballad of 
the White Horse, by Chesterton. How 
did it go? 

For the end of the world was long 
ago 

And all we stand today 

As children of a second birth 

Like some strange people left on 
Earth 

After a Judgment Day, 

Yes, the end of their world had 
come for the Rim colonists, in this 
Universe, long ago. 

And could Grimes and his crew 
of outsiders reverse the Judgment? 

XVIII 

S lowly, cautiously Corsair dropped 
to the clearing, her incandescent 
rocket exhaust incinerating the grass- 
like vegetation, raising great, roiling 
clouds of smoke and steam. A hu- 
man-built warship would have been 
fitted with nozzles from which, in 
these circumstances, a fire-snM>ther-

ing foam could be ejected. But Cor- 
sairs builders would have considered 
such a device a useless refinement. 
Slowly she settled, then came to rest, 
rocking slightly on her tripedal land- 
ing gear. Up and around the con- 
trol room ports billowed the dirty 
smoke and the white steam, gradual- 
ly thinning. Except for a few desert 
areas the climate of Stree was uni- 
formly wet, and nothing would burn 
for long. 

Grimes asked May hew to — as he 
phrased it — take psionic soundings, 
but from his past experience of this 
planet he knew that it would be a 
waste of time. The evidence indicat- 
ed that the Streen practiced tele- 
pathy among themselves but that 
their minds were closed to outsiders. 
But the saurians must have seen the 
ship land, and the pillar of cloud 
that she had created would be visible 
for many miles. 

Slowly the smoke cleared, and 
those in the control room were able 
to see, through the begrimed ports, 
the edge of the jungle, the tangle of 
lofty, femlike growths with, between 
them, the interlacing entanglement 
of creepers. Something was coming 
through the jungle, its passage mark- 
ed by an occasional eruption of tiny 
flying lizards from the crests of the 
tree ferns. Something was coming 
through tbe jungle and heading 
towards the ship. 

Gjimes got up from his chair and 
accompanied Sonya down to the air- 
lock. He smiled with wry amusement 
as he recalled his first landing on 
this world. Then he had been able 
to do things properly, had strode 
down the ramp in all the glory of 



gold braid and brass buttons, had 
even worn a quite useless ceremonial 
sword for the occasion. Then he had 
been accompanied by his staff, as 
formally attired as himself. Now he 
was wearing scanty, dirty rags and 
accompanied by a woman as nearly 
naked as he was. (But the Streen, 
who saw no need for clothing, had 
been more amused than impressed 
by his finery.) 

The airlock door was open, and 
the ramp was out. The Commodore 
and his wife did not descend at 
once to the still slightly smoking 
ground. One advantage of his dress 
uniform, thought Grimes, was that it 
had included half Wellington boots. 
The couple watched the dark tunnel 
entrance in the cliff of solid greenery 
that marked the end of the jungle 
track. 

A Streen emerged. He would have 
passed for a small dinosaur from 
Earth’s remote past, although the 
trained eye of a paleontologist would 
have detected differences. There was 
one difference that was obvious even 
to the untrained eye — the cranial 
development. This being had a brain, 
and not a small one. The little, glit- 
tering eyes stared at the humans. 
A voice like the hiss of escaping 
steam said, “Greetings.” 

“Greetings,” replied the Commo- 
dore. 

“You come again, man Grimes.” 
It was a statement of fact rather 
than a question. 

“I have never been here before,” 
said Grimes, adding, “Not in this 
spacetime.” 

“You have been here before. The 
last time your body was covered 



118 



IF 




with cloth and metal, trappings of 
no functional value. But no matter.” 
“How can you remember?” 

“1 cannot, but our Wise Ones re- 
member all things. What was, what 
is to come, what might have been 
and what might be. They told me to 
greet you and to bring you to them.” 
Grimes was less than enthusiastic. 
On the occasion of his last visit, the 
Wise Ones had lived not in the jungle 
but in a small, atypical patch of 
rocky desert, many miles to the 
north. Then he had been able to 
make the journey in one of Faraway 
Quest* s helicopters. Now he had- no 
flying machines at his disposal, and 
a spaceship is an unhandy brute to 
navigate in a planetary atmosphere. 
He did not fancy a long, long jour- 
ney on foot, or even riding one of 
the lesser saurians that the Streen 
used as draught animals, along a 
rough track partially choked with 
thorny undergrowth. Once again he 
was acutely conscious of the inade- 
quacy of his attire. 

The native cackled. (The Streen 
were not devoid of a sense of hu- 
mour.) He said, “The Wise Ones told 
me that you would not be clad for a 
journey. The Wise Ones await you 
in the village.” 

“Is it far?”' 

“It is where it was when you came 
before, when you landed your ship 
in this very place.” 

“No more than half an hour’s 
walk — ” began Grimes, addressing 
Sonya, then fell suddenly silent as an 
intense light flickered briefly, chang- 
ing and brightening the green of the 
jungle wall, the gaudy colors of the 
flowering vines. 



Involuntarily he looked up, but 
the golden overcast was unbroken. 
There was another flare behind the 
cloud blanket, blue-white, distant, 
and then, belatedly, the thunder of 
the first explosion drifted down, 
ominous and terrifying. 

“Missiles,” whispered the Commo- 
dore. “And my ship’s a sitting duck.” 
“Sir,” hissed the saurian, “you 
are not to worry. The Wise Ones 
have taken adequate steps for your 
— and our — protection.” 

“But you have no science, no tech- 
nology!” exclaimed Grimes, realiz- 
ing the stupidity of what he had 
said when it was too late. 

“We have science, man Grimes. 
We have machines to pit against the 
machines of your enemies. But our 
machines, unlike yours, are of flesh 
and blood, not of metal — although 
our anti-missiles, like yours, possess 
only a limited degree of intelligence.” 
“These people,” explained Grimes 
to Sonya, “are superb biological engi- 
neers.” 

“I know,” she said. “And I have 
little doubt that their air umbrella 
of pterodactyls will last longer tJian 
our furry friends’ supply of missiles. 
So I suggest that we leave them to 
it and go to see the Wise Ones.” 
She looked dubiously at the jungle, 
then turned to call to a woman in- 
side the ship, “Peggy! Bring us out 
a couple of machetes!” 

“You will not need them,” com- 
mented the Streen, “even though 
your skins are too soft.” 

T hey did need them, even though 
their guide went ahead like a 
tank clearing the way for infanifey. 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



119 




The vines and brambles were 
springy, reaching out with taloned 
tentacles as soon as the saurian had 
passed. 

Grimes and Sonya slashed until 
their arms were tired. But even so 
their perspiration smarted painfully 
in the fresh scratches all over their 
bodies. They were far from sorry 
when they emerged into another 
clearing, a small one, almost com- 
pletely roofed over with the dense 
foliage of the surrounding trees. 

There were the usual huts, woven 
from still-living creepers. There was 
the steaming compost pile that was 
the hatchery. There were the do- 
mesticated lizards, large and small, 
engaged in their s{>ecialized tasks — 
digging the vegetable plots, weeding 
and pruning. There were the young 
of the Streen, looking absurdly like 
plucked chickens, displaying the cu- 
riosity that is common to all intelli- 
gent beings throughout the galaxy, 
keeping a respectful distance from 
the visitors, staring at them from 
their black, unwinking eyes. There 
were the adults, equally curious, 
some of whom hustled the com- 
munity’s children out of the path of 
the humans, clearing a way to the 
door of a hut that, by Streen stand- 
ards, was imposing. From the open- 
ing drifted blue eddies of smoke — 
aromatic, almost intoxicating. Grimes 
knew that the use of the so-called 
sacred herbs, burned in a brazier and 
the smoke inhaled, was confined to 
the Wise Ones. 

There were three of the beings 
huddled there in the semi-darkness, 
grouped around the tripod from the 
top of which was suspended the cage 



in which the source of the smoke 
smouldered ruddily. 

The Commodore sneezed. The va- 
por, as far as he could gather, was 
mildly euphoric and, at the same 
time, hallucinogenic. But to human 
beings it was only an irritant to the 
nasal membranes. In spite of his 
efforts to restrain himself he sneezed 
again, loudly. 

The Streen around the tripod 
cackled thinly. The Commodore, his 
eyes becoming accustomed to the 
dim lighting, could see that they were 
old, old, their scales shabby and 
dulled with a lichenous growth, their 
bones protuberant beneath their ar- 
mored skins. There was something 
familiar about them — sensed rather 
than visually recognized. One of 
them crackl^, “Our dream smoke 
still makes you sneeze, man Grimes.” 
“Yes, Wise One.” 

“And what do you here, man 
Grimes? Were you not happy in your 
own here-and-now? Were you not 
happy with the female of your kind 
whom you have acquired since last 
we met, otherwhen-and-where?” 
“You’d better say ‘yes* to that!” 
muttered Sonya. 

Again the thin cackling. “We are 
lucky, man Grimes. We do not have 
the problems of you mammals, with 
your hot blood.” A pause. “But still 
we love life, just as you do. And we 
know that out there, falling about 
our world, are those who would end 
oiu* lives, just as they would end 
yours. Now they have not the power 
— but it is within their grasp.” 

“But would it matter to you?” 
asked Sonya. “I thought that you 
were — how shall I put it? — co- 



120 



IF 




existent with yourselves in all the 
alternative universes. You must be. 
You remember John’s first landing 
on this planet — but that was never 
in this here-and-now.” 

“You do not understand, woman 
Sonya. You cannot understand. But 
we will try to explain. Man Grimes. 
In your here-and-now what cargoes 
do your ships bring to Stree?” 
“Luxuries like tea and tobacco, 
Wise One. And books.” 

“What sort of books, man 
Grimes?” 

“History. Philosophy. Novels, 
even — ” then, as an afterthought — 
“poetry.” 

“And your poets say more in fewer . 
words than your philosophers. There 
is one whom I will quote to you. 

And he who lives more lives than 
one 

More deaths than one shall die. 
Does that answer your question, 
woman Sonya?” 

“I can feel it,” she murmured. 
“But I can’t understand it.” 

“It does not matter. And it does 
not matter if you do not understand 
what you are going to do — as long 
as you understand how to do it.” 
“And what is that?” asked Grimes. 
“To destroy the egg before it 
hatches,” was the reply. 

XIX 

A nybody meeting the seemingly 
primitive Streen for the first 
time would never dream that these 
saurians, for all their obvious intelli- 
gence, are engineers. Their towns 
and villages are, to the human way 
of thinking, utterly innocent of ma- 



chines. But what is a living organism 
but a machine — and engine that 
derives its motive power from the 
combustion of hydrocarbons in an 
oxygen atmosphere? On Stree a 
variety of semi-intelligent lizards per- 
form the tasks that on man-coloni?ed 
worlds are performed by mecha- 
nisms of meal and plastic. 

Yes, the Streen are engineers, bi- 
ological and psychological engineers 
of no mean calibre. 

In their dim hut, the little light 
was even further obscured by the 
acrid fumes from the brazier, the 
Wise Ones talked, and Grimes and 
Sonya listened. Much of what they 
were told was beyond them — but 
there was emotional rather than in- 
tellectual acceptance. They would 
not altogether understand, but they 
could feel. And, after all, the sym- 
biosis of flesh-and-blood machine 
and machine of metal and plastic 
was not too alien a concept. Such 
symbiosis, to a limited extent, has 
been known ever since the first sea- 
man handled the first ship, learning 
to make that clumsy contraption of 
wood and fiber an extension of his 
own body. 

Then, convinced although still not 
understanding, the Commodore and 
his wife returned to the ship. With 
them — slowly, creakingly — walked 
Serressor, the most ancient of the 
Wise Ones, and ahead of them their 
original guide did his best, as before, 
to clear a way for them through the 
spiny growths. 

They came to the clearing, to the 
charred patch of ground already 
speckled with the pale green shoots 
of new growth. And already the air 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



121 




ferns had begun to take root upon 
protuberances from the ship’s shell 
plating, from turrets and sponsons 
and antennae; already the vines were 
crawling up the vaned tripod of the 
landing gear. Williams had a work- 
ing party out, men and women who 
were hacking ill-humoredly at the 
superfluous and encroaching green- 
ery. 

From the corner of his eye the 
Executive Officer saw the approach 
of the Commodore, ceased shouting 
directions to his crew and walked 
slowly to meet his superior. He said, 
“The game’s crook. Skipper. What 
with lianas an’ lithophytes we’ll be 
lucky to get off the ground. An’ if 
we do — we’ve had it, like as not.” 

“Why, Commander Williams?” 

“Mayhew tells me that They have 
cotton^ on to what their psionic 
amplifiers have been doing. So — 
no more psionic amplifiers. Period.” 

“So we can’t give them false in- 
formation through their own com- 
munications system,” said Sonya. 

“You can say that again, Mrs. 
Grimes.” 

Serressor croaked, “So you depend 
upon misdirection to make your es- 
cape from our world.” 

“That is the case. Wise One,” 
Grimes told him. 

“We have already arranged that, 
man GrimesJ’ 

“You have?” Williams looked at 
the ancient saurian, seeing him for 
the first time. “Tom have? Cor stone 
the bleedin’ lizards. Skipper, what is 
this?” 

“This, Commander Wiliams,” said 
Grimes coldly, “is Serressor, Senior 
Wise One of the Streen. He and his 



people are as interested in disposing 
of the mutants as we are. They have 
told us a way in which it may be 
done, and Serressor will be coming 
with us to play his part in the opera- 
tion.” 

“An’ how will you do it?” de- 
manded Williams, addressing the 
saurian. 

Serressor hissed, “Destroy the egg 
before it is hatched.” 

Surprisingly, Williams did not ex- 
plode into derision. He said quietly, 
“I’d thought o’ that myself. We 
could do it — but it’s iffy, iffy. Too 
bloody iffy. There’re all the stories 
about what happens when the Drive 
gets out o’ kilter — but nobody’s 
ever come back to tell us if they’re 
true.” 

“If we’re going to use the Drive 
as Serressor suggests, it will have to 
be fitted with a special governor.” 

“That makes sense. Skipper. But 
where’re we gettin’ this governor 
from?” 

“We have it — or him — right 
here.” 

“Better him than me. There’re bet- 
ter ways o’ dyin’ then bein’ turned 
inside out.” He shifted his regard 
to the working party, who had taken 
the opportunity to relax their efforts. 
“Back to yer gardenin’, yer bunch o’ 
drongoes! I want this hull clean as 
a baby’s bottom!” 

“Shouldn’t you have said ‘smooth’. 
Commander?” asked Sonya rather 
sweetly. 

Before an argument could start 
Grimes pulled her up the ramp and 
into the ship. 

Following them slowly came the 
aged and decrepit saurian. 



122 



IF 




G rimes and his. officers were 
obliged to admit that the Streen 
had planned well and cunningly. 
When Corsair was ready for blasting 
off, a veritable horde of the winged 
lizards assembled above her, most 
of them carrying in their talons frag- 
ments of metal. Obedient to the 
command of their masters — the 
Streen were telepathic, but only in- 
sofar as their own kind were con- 
cerned — the pterosaurs grouped 
themselves into a formation re- 
sembling a spaceship, flapped off to 
the eastward. To the radar operators 
of the blockading squadron it would 
appear that Corsair had lifted, was 
navigating slowly and clumsily with- 
in the planetary atmosphere. 

There were missiles, of course. 
Some were intercepted by the 
suicidal air umbrella above the de- 
coys; some, whose trajectory would 
take them into uninhabited jungle 
regions, were allowed to continue 
their fall to the ground. They had 
been programmed to seek and to des- 
troy a spaceship. Winged lizards, 
even metal-bearing lizards, they 
ignored. 

Meanwhile — but cautiously, cau- 
tiously, with frequent and random 
shifts of frequency — Corsair's radio 
was probing, the sky. It seemed that 
the mutants’ squadron had swallowed 
the bait. Ship after ship broke from 
her orbit, recklessly expending her 
reaction mass so as to be advantage- 
ously situated when Corsair, the 
pseudo-C orsair, emerged from the 
overcast into space. 

And then the way out was as 
clear as ever it would be. The mu- 
tants’ cruisers were hull down, drop- 



ping below the round shoulder of the 
world. Aboard Corsair all hands were 
at their stations, and the firing cham- 
bers were warmed up in readiness. 

Grimes took her upstairs himself. 
With a deliberately dramatic flourish 
he brought his hand down to the 
keys, as though he were smacking 
a ready and willing steed on the 
rump. 

It was more like being fired from 
a gun than a conventional blastoff. 
Acceleration thrust all hands deep 
into the padding of their chairs. The 
Commodore was momentarily wor- 
ried by a thin, high whistling that 
seemed to originate inside the ship 
rather than outside her hull. Then, 
had it not been for the brutal down- 
drag on his facial muscles, he would 
have smiled. He remembered that 
the Streen, normally coldly unemo- 
tional, had always expressed appre- 
ciation of a trip in a space-vessel and 
had enjoyed, especially, violent 
maneuvers such as the one that he 
was now carrying out. If Serressor 
was whistling, then he was happy. 

Corsair whipped through the cloud 
blanket as though it had been no 
more than a chiffon veil, and harsh 
sunlight beat through the control 
room viewports like a physical blow. 
From the speaker of the transceiver 
came a shrill gabble of order and 
counter-order. Evidently some alert 
radar operator had spotted the 
breakout. But Corsair was out of 
laser range from the blockading 
squadron, was almost out of missile 
range. And by the time the enemy 
was able to close her she would be 
well clear of the planet’s Van Allens, 
would be falling into and through 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



123 




the dark, twisted dimensions created 
about herself by her own interstellar 

drive. 

It was time to get Serressor along 
to the Mannschenn Drive room. 

Grimes handed over to Williams, 
waited until he saw the Comman- 
der’s capable hands resting on his 
own control panel and then, slowly 
and painfully, levered himself out of 
his seat. He found it almost impossi- 
ble to stand upright under the crush- 
ing pseudo- gravity — but speed had 
to be maintained, otherwise the ship 
would be englobed by her enemies. 
Already Carter was picking off the 
first missiles with her laser. The 
Commodore watched two burly Ma- 
rines struggle to get the aged saurian 
to his feet. They were big men and 
strong, but the task was almost be- 
yond them. 

Then, with every shuffling step 
calling for an almost superhuman 
effort. Grimes led the way to the 
interstellar drive compartment. There 
— and how long had it taken him 
to make that short journey? — he 
found Bronson, Chief Interstellar 
Drive Engineer, with his juniors. And 
there was the ship’s Doctor, and the 
telepath Mayhew. Extending from 
the complexity of rotors, now still 
and silent, was a tangle of cables, 
each one of which terminated in a 
crocodile clip. 

The wall speaker crackled. “Com- 
mander to M.D. room. Calling the 
Commodore.” 

“Commodore here, Commander.” 

“Clear of Van Allens. No immedi- 
ate danger from enemy fire.” 

“Then carry on, Commander. You 
know what you have to do.” 



“Stand by for free fall. Stand by 
for course correction.” 

T he silence, as the rocket diive 
was cut, fell like a blow. Then, 
as the whining directional gyroscopes 
took over, the doctor, assisted by 
Bronson’s juniors, began to clip the 
cable ends to various parts of Ser- 
ressor’s body. The old saurian hissed 
gently, “You cannot hurt me, man 
Doctor. My scales are thick.” And 
then it was Mayhew’s turn, and a 
helmet of metal mesh was fitted 
over his head. The telepath was pale, 
frightened-looking. Grimes sympa- 
thized with him and admired him. 
Like every spaceman, he had heard 
all the stories of what happened to 
those trapped in the field of a mal- 
functioning Drive. Even though this 
would be (the Commodore hoped) 
a controlled malfunction, it would 
be a malfunction nonetheless. When 
the situation had been explained to 
him, the telepath had volunteered. 
Grimes hoped that the decoration 
for which he would recommend him 
would not be a posthumous one. 

The gentle, off-center gravitational 
effect of centrifugal force abruptly 
ceased, together with the humming 
of the directional gyroscopes. Then 
the ship trembled violently and sud- 
denly, and again. A hit? No, decided 
the Commodore, it was Carter firing 
a salvo of missiles. But the use of 
these weapons showed that the en- 
emy must be getting too close for 
comfort. 

Williams’s voice from the bulk- 
head speaker was loud, with a cer- 
tain urgency. 

“On course for Lorn, Skipper!” 



124 



IF 




“Mannschenn Drive on remote 
control,” ordered Grimes. “Serressor 
will give the word to switch on.” 
Already the doctor and the junior 
engineers had left the Mannschenn 
Drive room, making no secret of 
their eagerness to be out of the 
compartment before things started 
to happen. Bronson was making 
some last, finicking adjustments 
to his machinery, his heavily bearded 
face worried. “Hurry up, Comman- 
der,” Grimes snapped. 

The engineer grumbled, “I don’t 
like it. This is an interstellar drive, 
not a time machine.” 

Again came the violent trembling, 
and again, and again. 

Bronson finished what he was do- 
ing, then reluctantly left his domain. 
Grimes turned to Serressor, who now 
looked as though he had become 
enmeshed in the web of a spider. 
He said, “You know the risk.” 

“I know the risk. If I am . 
everted, it will be a new experience.” 
And not a pleasant one, thought 
the Commodore, looking at May- 
hew. The telepath was paler than 
ever, and his prominent Adam’s ap- 
ple wobbled as he swallowed hard. 
Not a pleasant one. And how could 
this . this non-human philoso- 
pher, who had never handled a metal 
tool in his long life, be so sure of 
the results of this tampering with, to 
him, utterly alien machinery? Sure, 
Serressor had read all the books (or 
his other-self in Grimes’s own con- 
tinuum had read all the books) on 
the theory and practice of Manns- 
chenn Drive operation. But book 
knowledge is a poor substitute for 
working experience. 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



“Good luck,” said Grimes to the 
saurian and to Mayhew. 

He left the compartment, carefully 
shut the door behind him. 

He heard the whine, the wrong- 
sounding whine, as the Drive started 
up. 

And then the dream-filled darkness 
closed about him. 

XX 

I t is said that a drowning man re- 
lives his life in the seconds be- 
fore final dissolution. 

So it was with Grimes. But he re- 
lived his life in reverse, experienced 
backwards the long history of tri- 
umphs and disasters, of true and 
false loves, of deprivations and shab- 
by compromises, of things and peo- 
ple that it was good to remember, 
of things and people that it had been 
better to forget. 

It was the very unreality of the 
experience, vivid though it was, that 
enabled him to shrug it off. It left 
him badly shaken but in full com- 
mand of his faculties when the throb- 
bing whine of the ever-precessing 
gyroscopes ceased at last. 

The ship had arrived. 

But wheje? 

When? 

Ahead in space and astern in time 
— that was- the principle of the 
Mannschenh Drive. But never full 
astern - — or, never intentionally 
full astern. Not until now. And what 
of the governors that had been fitted 
to the machine, the flesh-and-blood 
governors — the human telepath and 
the saurian philosopher, with his in- 
tuitive grasp of complexities that had 



baffled the finest mathematical 
brains of mankind? 

Had the governors broken under 
the strain? 

And what of himself, Grimes? 
(And what of Sonya?) 

He was still Grimes, still the Com- 
modore, with all his memories (so 
far as he knew) intact. He was not 
a beardless youth (his investigatory 
hand verified this). He was not a 
puling infant. He was not a tiny 
blob of protoplasm on the' alleyway 
deck. He opened the door. 

Seiressor was still there, still en- 
tangled in the shining filaments. But 
his scales gleamed with the luster of 
youth, his bright eyes were unfilmed. 
His voice, as he said, “Man Grimes, 
we were successful!” was still a 
croak, but no longer a senile croak. 

“We did it!” confirmed Mayhew, 
in an oddly high voice. 

The telepath was shrunken. The 
rags that had been his loin clout 
were in an untidy bundle about his 
bare feet. No, shrunken was not the 
word. He was smaller, younger. 
Much younger. 

“That was the hardest part,” he 
said. “That was the hardest part — 
to stop the reversal of biological 
time. Serressor and I were right in 
the field, so we were affected. But 
the rest of you shouldn’t be changed. 
You still have your long, gray beard. 
Commodore.” 

But my beard wasn*t gray, thought 
Grimes, with the beginning of panic. 
Neither was it long. He pulled a hair 
from it, wincing at the sudden pain, 
examined the evidence (still dark 
brown) while Serressor cackled and 
Mayhew giggled.

“All right,” he growled. “You’ve 
had your joke. What now?” 

“We wait,” Mayhew told him. 
“We wait, here and now, until Sun- 
downer shows up. Then it’s up to 
you, sir.” 

Sundowner, thought Grimes. Jolly 
Swagman. Waltzing Matilda. Names 
that belonged to the early history 
of the Rim Worlds. The battered star 
tramps of the Sundowner Line that 
had served the border planets in the 
days of their early colonization, long 
before secession from the Federa- 
tion had been even dreamed of, long 
before the Rim Worlds government 
had itself become a shipowner with 
the Rim Runners fleet. 

Sundowner Grimes remembered 
his history. She had been the first 
ship too bring a cargo of seed grain 
to Lorn. And that was when this al- 
ternative universe, this continuum in 
which Grimes and his people were 
invaders, had run off the historical 
rails. Sundowner. Serressor knew his 
history too. The Wise One had 
planned this rendezvous in Space and 
Time, so that Grimes could do 
what, in his universe, had been ac- 
complished by plague or traps or, 
even, oats or terrier dogs. 

“I can hear her,” murmured May- 
hew distantly. “She is on time. Her 
people are worried. They want to 
get to port before their ship is 
taken over by the mutants.” 

“In this here-and-now,” said Ser- 
ressor, “she crashed — will crash? 
— in the mountains. Most of the 
mutants survived. But go to your 
control room, man Grimes. And 
then you will do what you have to 
do.” 



T hey were all very quiet in the 
control room, all shaken by the 
period of temporal disorientation 
through which they had passed. 
Grimes went first to Williams, 
hunched in his co-pilot’s chair. He 
said softly, “You are ready. Com- 
mander?” 

“Ready,” answered the* Executive 
Officer tunelessly. 

Then the Commodore went to sit 
beside his wife. She was pale, sub- 
dued. She looked at him carefully, 
and a faint smile curved her Ups. 
She murmured, “You aren’t changed, 
John. I’m pleased about that. I’ve 
remembered too much, things that 
I thought I’d forgotten, and even 
though it was all backwards it was 
. shattering. I’m pleased to have 
you to hold on to, and I’m pleased 
that is is you, and not some puppy.” 
“I shouldn’t have minded losing 
a few years in the wash,” grunted 
Grimes. 

He looked at the officers at their 
stations — radar, gunnery, electronic 
radio. He stared out of the ports — 
at the Lorn sun, its brightness dim- 
med by polarization, at the great, 
dim-glowing galactic lens. Here, at 
the very edge of the universe, the 
passage of years, of centuries was not 
obvious to a casual glance. There 
were no constellations in the Rim 
sky that, by their slow distortions, 
could play the part of clocks. 

“Contact,” announced the radar 
officer softly. 

The Commodore looked into his 
own repeater screen, saw the tiny 
spark that had appeared in the black- 
ness of the tank. 

The radio officer was speaking in-

to his microphone. ^^Corsair to Sun- 
downer. Corsair to Sundowner. Do 
you read me? Over.” 

The voice that answered was that 
of a tired man, a man who had 
been subjected to considerable strain. 
It was unsteady, seemed on the edge 
of hysteria. “I hear you, whoever 
you are. What the hell did you say 
your name was?” 

^'Corsair. This is Corsair, calling 
Sundowner. Over.” 

“Never heard of you. What sort 
of name is that, anyhow?” And 
there was another, fainter voice, say- 
ing, ""Corsairl Don’t like the sound 
of it, Captain. Could be a pirate.” 
“A pirate? Out here, on the Rim? 
Don’t be so bloody silly. There just 
aren’t the pickings to make it worth- 
while.” A pause. “If she is a pirate, 
she’s welcome to our bloody cargo.” 
**Corsair to Sundowner. Corsair to 
Sundowner. Come in, please. Over.” 
“Yes, Corsair. I hear you. What 
Ihe hell do you want?” 

“Permission to board.” 

“Permission to board? Who the 
bloody hell do you think you are?” 
“R.W.C.S. Corsair.^' 

“R.W.C.S.?” It was obvious that 
Sundowner's Captain was addressing 
his Mate without bothering either 
to switch off or to cover his micro- 
phone. “What the hell is that, Joe?” 
“Haven’t a clue,” came the reply. 
Grimes switched in his own micro- 
phone. He did not want to alarm 
Sundowner, did not want to send her 
scurrying back into the twisted con- 
tinuum generated by her Mannschenn 
Drive. He knew that he could blow 
the unarmed merchantman to a puff 
of incandescent vapor and that 



such an action would have the de- 
sired result. But he did not want to 
play it that way. He was acutely 
conscious that he was about to com- 
mit the crime of genocide — and 
who could say that the mutated rats 
were less deserving of life than the 
humans whom, but for Grimes’s 
intervention, they would replace? He 
did not wish, also, to have the mur- 
der of his own kind on his con- 
science. 

“Captain,” he said urgently, “this 
is Commodore Grimes speaking, of 
the naval forces of the Rim Worlds 
Confederacy. It is vitally important 
that you allow us to board your ship. 
We know about the trouble you are 
having. We wish to help you.” 

“You wish to help us?” 

“If we wished you ill,” said 
Grimes patiently, “we could have 
opened fire on you as soon as you 
broke through into normal space- 
time.” He paused. “You have a 
cargo of seed grain. There were rats 
in the grain. And these rats have 
been multiplying. Am I correct?” 
“You are. But how do you know?” 
“Never mind that. And these rats 
— there are mutants among them, 
aren’t there? You’ve been coming 
a long time from Elsinore, haven’t 
you? Mannschenn Drive breakdowns 
. and fluctuations in the tem- 
poral precession fields to speed up 
the rate of mutation.” 

“But, sir, how do you know? We 
have sent no messages. Our psionic 
radio officer was killed by the . 
the mutants.” 

“We know. Captain. And now may 
we board?” 

From the speaker came the faint 



128 



IF 




voice of Sundowner's Mate. “Rim 
Ghosts are bad enough — but when 
they take over Quarantine it’s a bit 
rough.” 

“Yes,” said Grimes. “You may 
regard us as Rim Ghosts. But we’re 
solid ones.” 

XXI 

H is big hands playing over his 
console like those of a master 
pianist, Williams, with short, care- 
fully timed bursts from the auxiliary 
jets, jockeyed Corsair into a position 
only yards from Sundowner y used 
his braking rockets to match veloci- 
ties. 

Grimes and his people stared out 
through the ports at the star tramp. 
She was old, old. Even now, at a 
time that was centuries in the past of 
Corsair's people, she was obsoles- 
cent. Her hull plating was dull, pitted 
by years of exposure to micromete- 
orites. Two of the embossed letters 
of her name had been broken off 
and never replaced, although some- 
body had replaced the missing U 
and W with crudely painted charac- 
ters. Grimes could guess what con- 
ditions must be like on board. She 
would be one of these ships in which, 
to give greater lift for cargo, the 
pile shielding had been cut to a 
minimum, the contents of her holds 
affording, in theory, protection from 
radiation. And her holds were full of 
grain. And this grain supported pests 
that, through rapid breeding and mu- 
tation, had become a menace rather 
than a mere nuisance. 

“Boarders away, sir?” asked the 
Marine officer. 



“Yes, Major. Yourself and six 
men should do. I and Mrs. Grimes 
will be coming with you.” 

“Side arms, sir?” 

“No. That crate’ll have paper- 
thin bulkheads and shell plating, and 
we can’t afford any playing around 
with lasers.” 

“Then knives and clubs, sir?” 

“It might be advisable. Yes.” 
Grimes and Sonya left Control 
for their quarters. There, helping 
each other, they shrugged into their 
modified spacesuits. These still had 
the tail sheaths and helmets designed 
to accommodate a long-muzzled 
head. This had its advantages, pro- 
viding stowage for a full beard. But 
Grimes wondered what Sundowner's 
people would think when they saw a 
party of seeming aliens jetting from 
Corsair to their airlock. Anyhow, 
it was their own fault. They should 
have had their vision transmitter 
and receiver in order. 

The boarding party assembled at 
the main airlock which, although it 
was cramped, was big enough to hold 
all of them. The inner door slowly 
closed and then, after the pumps 
had done their work {Corsair could 
not afford to throw away atmo- 
sphere) the outer door opened. 
Grimes could see, then, that an aper- 
ture had appeared in the shell plat- 
ing of the other ship, only twenty 
feet or so distant. But it was small. 
It must be only an auxiliary airlock. 
The Captain of Sundowner y thought 
Grimes, must be a cautious man, 
must have determined to let the 
boarding party into his ship one by 
one instead of in a body. And he'll 
be more cautious stilly thought

Grimes, when he sees these space- 
suits. 

He shuffled to the door sill. He 
said into his helmet miscrophone, 
“There’s room for only one at a 
time in that airlock of theirs. I’ll go 
first.” 

He heard the Major acknowledge, 
and then he jumped, giving himself 
the slightest possible push-off from 
his own ship. He had judged well 
and did not have to use his suit re- 
action unit. Slowly, but not too slow- 
ly, he drifted across the chasm be- 
tween the two vessels, extended his 
arms to break his fall and, with one 
hand, caught hold of the projecting 
rung above Sundowner s airlock 
door. 

As he had assumed, the compart- 
ment was large enough to hold only 
one person — and he had to act 
quickly to pull his dummy tail out 
of the way of the closing outer valve. 
There were no lights in the airlock 
— or, if there were lights, they 
weren’t working. But after a while 
he heard the hissing that told him 
that pressure was being built up. 

Suddenly the inner door opened 
and glaring light blinded the Com- 
modore. He could just see two dark 
figures standing there, with what 
looked like pistols in their hands. 
Through his helmet diaphragm he 
heard somebody say, “What did I 
tell you. Captain? A bleeding kan- 
garoo in full armor, no less. Shall I 
shoot it?” 

“Wait!” snapped Grimes. He 
hoped that the note of authority 
would not be muffled from his voice. 
“Wait! I’m as human as you.” 

“Then prove it, mister!” 



S lowly the Commodore raised his 
gloved hands, turning them to 
show that they were empty. He 
said, “I am going to remove my hel- 
met — unless one of you gentlemen 
would caie to do it for me.” 

“Not bloody likely. Keep your 
distance.” 

“As you please.” Grimes mani- 
pulated fastenings, gave the regu- 
lation half turn and lifted. At once 
he noticed the smell — it was like 
the stink that had hung around his 
own wardroom for days after the 
attempted interrogation of the prison- 
er. 

“All right,” said one of the men. 
“You can come in.” 

Grimes shuffled into the ship. The 
light was out of his eyes now, and 
he could see the two men. He did 
not have to ask who or what they 
were. Uniform regulations change 
far more slowly than do civilian 
fashions, especially when uniforms 
are worn as much for function as 
for appearance. He addressed the 
grizzled, unshaven man with the four 
tarnished gold bars on his shoulder 
boards, “We have already spoken 
with each other by radio, Captain. 
I am Commodore Grimes.” 

“Of the Rim Worlds Confederacy’s 
Navy. But what’s the idea of the fan- 
cy dress, CommodoreT* 

“The fancy dress?” Then Grimes 
realized that the man was referring 
to his spacesuit, so obviously de- 
signed for a non-human. What would 
be his reaction to what Grimes was 
wearing underneath it — the scanty 
rags and the rank marks printed on 
to his skin? But it was of no im- 
portance. He said, “It’s a long story, 

IF 



130 




Captain, and I haven’t time to tell 
it now. What I am telling you is 
that you must not, repeat not, at- 
tempt a landing on Lorn until I have 
given you clearance.” 

“And who the hell do you think 
you are. Mister so-called Commo- 
dore? We’ve had trouble enough this 
trip. What is your authority?” 

“My authority?” Grimes grinned. 
“In my own space and time, the 
commission I hold, signed by the 
President of the Confederacy.” 
“What did I say?” demanded the 
Mate. “And I’ll say it again. He’s 
some sort of bloody pirate.” 

“And, in the here-and-now,” con- 
tinued Grimes, “my missile batteries 
and my laser projectors.” 

“If you attempt to hinder me from 
proceeding on my lawful occasions,” 
said the tramp Master stubbornly, 
“that will be piracy.” 

Grimes looked at him, not with- 
out sympathy. It was obvious that 
this man had been pushed to the 
very limits of human endurance. The 
lined face and the red-rimmed eyes 
told of many, too many, hours with- 
out sleep. And he had seen at least 
one of his officers killed. By this 
time he would be regarding the en- 
emies infesting his ship as mutineers 
rather than mutants and, no longer 
quite rational, would be determined 
to bring his cargo to port come Hell 
or High Water. 

And that he must not do. 

G rimes lifted his helmet to put it 
back on. In spite of the metal 
with which he was surrounded he 
might be able to get through to Wil- 
liams in Corsair's control room, to 



Williams and to Carter, to give the 
order that would call a laser beam 
to slice off Sundowner's main ven- 
turi. But the Mate guessed his in- 
tention, swung viciously with his 
right arm and knocked the helmet 
out of the Commodore’s hand. He 
growled to his Captain, “We d6n’t 
want the pirate callin’ his little 
friends, do we, sir?” 

“It is essential that I keep in com- 
munication with my own ship,” said 
Grimes stiffly. 

“So you can do somethin’ with all 
the fancy ironmongery you were 
tellin’ us about!” The Mate vicious- 
ly swatted the helmet which, having 
rebounded from a bulkhead, was now 
drifting through the air. 

“Gentlemen,” said Grimes rea- 
sonably, looking at the two men and 
at the weapK>ns they carried, auto- 
matic pistols, no more than five 
millimeter calibre but deadly enough. 
He might disarm one — but the 
other would fire. “Gentlemen, I 
have come to help you.” 

“More of a hindrance than 
a bloody help,” snarled the Mate. 
“We’ve enough on our plates already 
without having to listen to your fairy 
stories about some non-existent Con- 
federacy.” He turned to the Master. 
“What say we start up the reaction 
drive an’ set course for Lorn? This 
bloke’s cobbers’ll not open fire so 
long as he’s aboard.” 

“Yes. Do that, Mr. Holt. And 
then we’ll put this man in irons.” 

So this was it, thought Grimes 
dully. So this was the immutability 
of the Past, of which he had so 
often read. This was the inertia of 
the flow of events. He had come to 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



131 




where and when he could best stick 
a finger into the pie — but the crust 
was too tough, too hard. He couldn’t 
blame the tramp Captain. He, as a 
good shipmaster, was displaying the 
utmost loyalty to his charterers. And 
— Grimes remembered his Rim 
Worlds history — those consignments 
of seed grain had been urgently 
needed on Lorn. 

And, more and more, every word 
was an effort, every action. It was 
as though he were immersed in some 
viscous fluid, fathoms deep. He was 
trying to swim against the Time 
Stream — and it was too much for 
him. 

Why not just drift? After all, 
there would be time to do something 
after the landing at Port Forlorn. Or 
would there? Hadn’t somebody told 
him that this ship had crashed in 
mountainous country? 

He was aroused from his despair- 
ing lethargy by a sudden clangor of 
alarm bells, by a frightened, distorted 
voice that yammered from a bulk- 
head speaker, “Captain! Where are 
you. Captain? They’re attacking the 
control room!” 

More as the result of years of 
training than of conscious thought 
he suatohed his drifting helmet as 
he followed the Captain and his Mate 
when they dived into the axial shaft, 
as they puhed themselves hand over 
hand along the guidelines to the bows 
of the ship. 

XXII 

4 4rr^heyTe attacking the control 
A room!” 

The words echoed through 



Grimes’ mind. They must be Sonya 
and the Major and his men. They 
must have breached the ports. So 
far there was no dimunition of air 
pressure — but even such a sorry 
rustbucket as Sundowner would have 
her airtight doors in reasonably good 
working order. All the same, he 
deemed it prudent to pause in his 
negotiation of the axial shaft to put 
his helmet back on. Luckily the 
rough treatment that it had re- 
ceived at the hands of the Mate did 
not seem to have damaged it. 

Ahead of him, the two Sundowner 
officers were making rapid progress. 
It was obvious that they were not 
being slowed down by emergency 
doors and sphincter locks. The Com- 
modore tried to catch up with them; 
but he was hampered by a spacesuit, 
and they were not. 

Then, faintly through his helmet 
diaphragm, he heard the sounds of 
a- struggle, a fight. There were shots 
— by the sharpness of the cracks 
fired from small caliber pistols such 
as the Captain and his Mate had 
been carrying. There were shouts 
and screams. And there was a dread- 
ful, high squeaking that was familiar, 
too familiar. He thought that he 
could make out words — or the 
repetition of one word only. 

“Kill! Kill!” 

He knew theq who They were 
and pulled himself along the guide- 
line with the utmost speed of which 
he was capable. Glancing ahead, he 
saw that Sundowner*s Master and 
his second in command were 
scrambling through the open hatch 
at the end of the shaft, the hatch 
that must give access, in a ship of 



132 



IF 




this type, to Control. He heard more 
shots, more shouts and screams. He 
reached the hatch himself, pulled 
himself through, floundered wildly 
for long seconds until his magnetized 
boot soles made contact with the 
deck. 

They ignored him at first. Per- 
haps it was that they took him — 
in his tailed suit with its snouted 
helmet — for one of their own kind, 
although, by their standards, a gi- 
ant. They were small, no larger than 
a terrier dog, but there were many 
of them. They were fighting with 
claws and teeth and pieces of sharp- 
ened metal that They were using as 
knives. A fine mist of blood fogged 
the faceplate of Grimes’s helmet, 
half blinding him. But he could see 
at least two human bodies, obviously 
dead, their throats torn out, and at 
least a dozen of the smaller corpses. 

He did not give himself time to 
be shocked by the horror of the 
scene. (That would come later, much 
later.) He tried to wipe the film of 
blood from his visor with a gloved 
hand, but only smeared it. But he 
could see that the fight was still go- 
ing on. In the center of the control 
room a knot of spacemen was still 
standing, still struggling. They must 
either have lost their pistols or ex- 
hausted their ammunition; there 
were no more shots. 

Grimes joined the fight, his ar- 
mored fists and arms flailing into 
the mass of furry bodies, his hands 
crushing them and pulling them 
away from the humans, throwing 
them from him with savage violence. 
At first his attack met with success 
— and then the mutants realized 



that he was another enemy. Their 
squeaking rose to an initolerable level, 
and more and more of them poured 
into the control room. They swarm- 
ed over the Commodore, clinging 
to his arms and legs, immobilizing 
him. Sundowner's officers could not 
help him. They, too, were fighting 
a losing battle for survival. 

There was a scratching at Grimes’s 
throat. One of his assailants had a 
knife of sorts, was trying to saw 
through the fabric joint. It was a 
tough fabric, designed for wear and 
tear — but not such wear and tear 
as this. Somehow the man contrived 
to get his right arm clear, managed, 
with an effort, to bring it up to bat 
away the knife wielder. He succeeded 
— somehow. And then there was 
more scratching and scraping at the 
joint at his armpit. 

He was blinded, helpless, sub- 
merged in a sea of furry bodies, all 
too conscious of the frantic scrab- 
blings of their teeth arid claws and 
knives. His armor, hampering his 
every movement even in ideal con- 
ditions, could well contribute to his 
death rather than saving his life. He 
struggled still — but it was an in- 
stinctive struggle rather than one 
consciously directed, no more than 
a slow, agonized shrugging, a series 
of laborious contortions to protect 
his vulnerable joints from sharp teeth 
and serrated blades. 

Then there was a respite, and he 
could move once more. 

H e saw, dimly, that the control 
room was more crowded than 
ever, that other figures, dressed as 
he was, had burst in, were fighting 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



133 




with deadly efficiency, with long, 
slashing blades and bone-crushing 
cudgels. It was a hand-to^and battle 
in a fog — and the fog was a dread- 
ful cloud of finely divided particles 
of freshly shed blood. 

But even these reinforcements 
were not enough to turn the tide. 
Sooner or later — and probably 
sooner — the mutants would swamp 
the humans, armored and unarmor- 
ed, by sheer weight of numbers. 

“Abandon ship!” somebody was 
shouting. It was a woman’s voice, 
Sonya’s. “Abandon ship! To the. 
boats!” And then the cry — fainter 
this time, heard through the helmet 
diaphragm rather than over his suit 
radio — was repeated. It is no light 
matter to give up one’s vessel. But 
now, after this final fight. Sundown- 
er*s people were willing to admit 
they they were beaten. 

Somehow the armored Marines 
managed to surround the crew — 
what was left of them. The Captain 
was still alive, although only half 
oooscious. The Mate, apart from a 
few scratches, was untouched. There 
were two engineers and an hysterical 
wcMnan with Purser’s braid on her 
tom shirt. That was all. They were 
hustled by Corsair's men to the 
hatch, thrust down the axial shaft. 
Grimes shouted his protest as some- 
body pushed him after them. He 
realized that it was Sonya, that she 
was still with him. Over their heads 
the hatch lid slammed into its closed 
position. 

“The Major and his men,” he 
managed to get out. “They can’t 
stay there, in that hell!” 

“They won’t,” she told him. 



“They’ll manage. Our job is to get 
these people clear of the ship and to 
do it immediately.” 

“And then?” 

“Who’s in charge of this bloody 
operation?” she asked tartly. “Who 
was it who told the Admiral that 
he was going to play this whole thing 
by ear?” 

Then they were out of the axial 
shaft and into a boat bay. They 
watched the Mate help the woman 
into the small, torped6-like craft, 
then stand back to allow the two 
engineers to enter. He tried to assist 
the Captain to board — but his 
superior pushed him away weakly, 
saying, “No, Mister. I’ll be the last 
man off my ship, if you please.” He 
noticed Grimes and Sonya standing 
there. “And that applies to you, too, 
Mr. Commodore whoever you say 
you ;are. Into the boat with you — 
you and your mate.” 

“We’ll follow you. Captain. It’s 
hardly more than a step across to 
our own ship.” 

“Into the boat with you, damn 
you. I shall be . the . last ...” 
The man was obviously on the 
verge of collapse. His Mate grasped 
his elbow. “Sir, this is no time to 
insist on protocol. We have to hurry. 
Can’t you hear Them?” 

Through his helmet Grimes, him- 
self, hadn’t heard them until now. 
But the noise was there, the fren- 
zied chittering, surely louder with 
every passing second. “Get into that 
bloody boat,” he told the Mate. 
“We’ll handle the doors.” 

“I . insist . .” whispered the 
Captain. “I shall ... be ... the last 
... to leave . .”

( ^ow wJiat to do,” Grimes 

1 toldlbeM^ 

**And many’s die time Fve wanted 
to do it. But not in these dicum- 
stances.” His fist came up to his 
superior’s jaw. It was little more 
than a tap, but enough. The Master 
did not fall, could not fall in these 
conditions of zero gravity. But he 
swayed there, anchored to the deck 
by his magnetic boot soles, out on 
his feet. The two engineers emerged 
from the lifecraft, lugged the uncon- 
scious man inside. 

“Hurry!” ordered Sonya. 

“Make for your ship, sir?” asked 
the Mate. “You’ll pick us up?” 

“No. Sorry — but there’s no time 
to explain. Just get the hell out and 
make all speed for Lorn.” 

“But . .” 

“You heard what the Commodore 
said,” snapped Sonya. “Do it. If 
you attempt to lay your boat along- 
side we open fire.” 

“But . .” 

Grimes had removed his helmet 
so that his voice would not be 
muffled by the diaphragm. “Get into 
that bloody boat!” he roared. And 
in a softer voice, as the Mate obeyed, 
“Good luck.” 

He replaced his helmet and, as he 
did so, Sonya operated the controls 
set into the bulkhead. A door slid 
shut, sealing off the boat bay from 
the rest ‘of the ship. The outer door 
opened, revealing the black empti- 
ness of the Rim Sky. Smoothly and 
efficiently the catapult operated, 
throwing the boat out and clear. 
Intense violet flame blossomed at 
her blunt stem, and then she was 
away, diminishing into the distance. 



coming around in a great arc on to 
the trajectory that would take her to 
safety. 

Grimes didn’t watch her for long. 
He said, “We’d better gel back to 
Control, to help the Major and his 
men. They’re trapped in there.” 
“They aren’t trapped. They’re just 
waiting to see that the boat’s es- 
caped.” 

“But how will they get out?” 
“The same way that we got into 
this rustbucket. We‘ sent back to the 
ship for a laser pistol, burned our 
way in. Luckily the airtight doors 
were all in good working order.” 
“You took a risk.” 

“It was a risk we had to take. 
And we knew that you were wearing 
a spacesuit. But it’s time we weren’t 
here.” 

“After you.” 

“My God! Are you going to be as 
stuffy as that Captain?” 

Grimes didn’t argue, but pushed 
her out of the boat lock. He jumped 
after her, somersaulting slowly in 
the emptiness. He used his suit re- 
action unit to steady himself and 
found himself facing the ship that 
he had just left. He saw an explo- 
sion at her bows, a billowing cloud 
of debris that expanded slowly — 
broken glass, crystallizing atmo- 
sphere, a gradually separating mass 
of bodies, most of which ceased to 
move after a very few seconds. 

But there were the larger bodies, 
seven of them, spacesuited — and 
each of them sprouted a tail of in- 
candescence as the Marines jetted 
back to their own ship. The Major 
had used his laser pistol to break 
out through the control room ports. 



136 



IF 




All the mutants would not be dead. 
There would be survivors, sealed off 
in their airtight compartments by 
the slamming of the emergency 
doors. 

The survivors could be disposed 
of by Corsair's main armament. 

XXIII 

4CTTTe were waiting for you, 

VV Skipper,” Williams told 
Grimes cheerfully as the Commo- 
dore re-entered his own control 
room. 

“Very decent of you. Comman- 
der,” Grimes said, remembering how 
the Mate of Sundowner had realized 
his long standing ambition and clob- 
bered his Captain. “Very decent of 
you.” 

He looked out of the viewports. 
The grain carrier was still close, at 
least as close as she had been when 
he had boarded her. The use of mis- 
siles would be dangerous to the ves- 
sel employing them. Even lasers 
might touch off a mutually destruc- 
tive explosion. 

“You must still finish your task, 
man Grimes,” Serressor reminded 
him. 

“I know. I know.” But there was 
no hurry. There was ample time to 
consider ways and means. 

“All armament ready, sir,” re- 
ported Carter. 

“Thank you. To begin with, Com- 
mander Williams, we’ll open the 
range . .” 

Then, suddenly, the outline of Sun- 
downer shimmered, shimmered and 
faded. She flickered out like a can- 
dle in a puff of wind. 



Grimes cursed. He should have 
foreseen this. The mutants had access 
to the Mannschenn Drive machinery 
— and how much, by continuous 
eavesdropping, had they learned? 
How much did they know? 

“Start M.D.,” he ordered. “Stand- 
ard precession.” 

It took time — but not too long 
a time. Bronson was* already in the 
Mannschenn Drive room, and Bron- 
son had been trained to the naval 
way of doing things rather than the 
relatively leisurely procedure of the 
merchant service. (Himself a mer- 
chant officer, a reservist, he had al- 
ways made it his boast that he could 
beat the navy at its own game.) 
There was the brief period of tem- 
poral disorientation, the uncanny 
feeling that time was running back- 
wards, the giddiness, the nausea. 
Outside the ports the Galactic Lens 
assumed the appearance of a distort- 
ed Klein flask, and the Lorn sun 
became a pulsing spiral of multi- 
colored light. 

But there was no sign of Sundown- 
er, 

Grimes was speaking into the tele- 
phone. “Commander Bronson! Can 
you synchronize?” 

“With whatT Then — “Fll try, 
sir. ni try.” 

Grimes could visualize the en- 
gineer watching the flickering nee- 
dles of his gauges, the undulant traces 
in his oscilloscopes, making adjust- 
ments measured in fractions of mi- 
croseconds to his controls. Subtly 
the keening song of the spinning, 
pressing gyroscopes wavered. And 
as it did so the outlines of the peo- 
ple and instruments in the control 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



137 




roam lost their sharpness, while the 
colors of everything momentarily 
dulled and then became more vivid. 

“There’s the damned ship!” shout- 
ed Williams. 

And there she was, close aboard 
them, a phantom ship adrift on a 
sea of impossible blackness, insub- 
stantial, quivering on the very verge 
of invisibility. 

“Fire at will!” ordered Grimes. 

“But, sir,” protested one of the 
officers. “If we interfere with the 
ship’s mass while the Drive is in 
operation. .” 

Fire at will!'* repeated the Com- 
modore. 

“Aye, aye, sir!” acknowledged 
Carter happily. 

But it was like shooting at a shad- 
ow. Missiles erupted from their 
launchers, laser beams stabbed out 
at the target — and nothing happen- 
ed. From the bulkhead speaker of 
the intercom Bronson snarled, “What 
the hell are you playing at up there? 
How the hell can I hold her in 
synchronization?” 

“Sorry, Commander,” said Grimes 
into his microphone. “Just lock on, 
and hold her. Just hold her, that’s 
all I ask.” 

“An’ what now, Skipper?” de- 
manded Williams. “What now?” 

“We shall use the Bomb,” said 
Grimes quietly. 

4CTxre shall use the Bomb,” he 
y V said. He knew, as did all of 
his people, that the fusion device 
was their one hope of a return to 
their own Space and Time. But 
Sundowner must be destroyed; the 
Time Stream must, somehow, be di- 



verted. Chemical explosives and de- 
structive light beams were, in these 
circumstances, useless. There re- 
mained only the Sunday Punch. 

The ships were close, so close that 
their temporal precession fields inter- 
acted. Even so, it was obvious why 
all the weapons so far employed had 
failed. Each and every discharge 
had meant an appreciable alteration 
of Corsair's temporal precession 
rate, so that each and every missile 
and beam had missed in Time rather 
than in Space. Had Corsair been 
fitted with one of the latest model 
synchronizers her gunnery might 
have been more successful — but 
she was not. Only Bronson’s skill 
was keeping her in visual contact 
with her prey. 

Getting the Bomb into position 
was not the same as loosing off a 
missile. Slowly, gently, the black- 
painted cylinder was eased out of its 
bay. The merest puff from one of 
its compressed air jets nudged it 
away from Corsair towards the tar- 
get. It fell gently through the space 
between the two ships, came finally 
to rest against Sundowner's scarred 
hull. 

At an order from Grimes the 
thick, lead shutters slid up over the 
control room ports. (But the thing 
was close, so close, too close. Even 
with the radar on minimum range, 
the glowing blob that was Sundowner 
almost filled the tank.) Carter looked 
at Grimes, waiting for the order. 
His face was pale — and it was 
not the only pale face in Control. 
But Serressor — that blasted lizard! 
— was filling the confined space 
with his irritating whistling.

Sonya came to sit beside him. 
She said quietly, “You have to 
do it. We have to do it.” 

Even her presence could not dispel 
the loneliness of command. “No,” 
he told her. “/ have to do it.” 
“Locking,” came Bronson’s voice 
from the bulkhead speaker. “Lock- 
ing. Holding.” 

“Fire,” said Grimes. 

XXIV 

ime had passed. 

How long. Grimes did not 
know, nor would he ever know. 
(Perhaps, he was often to suspect 
later, this was the next time around, 
or the time after that.) 

He half opened his eyes and look- 
ed at the red-haired woman who was 
shaking him back to wakefulness — 
the attractive woman with the faint 
soar still visible between her firm 
breasts. What was her name? He 
should know. He was married to her. 
Or had been married to her. It was 
suddenly of great importance that 
he should remember what she was 
called. 



Susan . .? 

Sarah . .? 

No . 

Sonya . .? 

Yes, Sonya. That was it. 

“John, wake up! Wake up! It’s all 
over now. The Bomb blew us back 
into our own Continuum, back to 
our own Time, even! We’re in touch 
with Port Forlorn Naval Control, 
and the Admiral wants to talk to 
you personally.” 

“He can wait,” said Grimes, feel- 
ing the fragments of his prickly per- 
sonality click back into place. 

He opened his eyes properly, saw 
Williams sitting at his controls, saw 
Serressor, near by, still youthful, and 
with him the gangling adolescent 
who was Mayhew. 

For a moment he envied them. 
They had regained their youth — 
but at a dreadful risk to themselves. 
Even so, they had been lucky. 

And so, he told himself, had been 
the human race — not for the first 
time, and not for the last. 

He thought, I hope I’m not around 
when our luck finally does run out.

IN THE BONE 

by GORDON R. DICKSON 

Illustrated by FINLAY 

He came off the deadliest war 
fleet in history to do battle 
with naked hands — and brain! 



I 

P ersonally, his name was Harry 
Brennan. 

Officially, he was the John Paul 
Jones, which consisted of four bil- 
lion doflars worth of irresistible 
equipment — the latest and best of 
human science — designed to spread 
its four thousand-odd components 
out through some fifteen cubic me- 
ters of space under ordinary con- 
ditions — designed also to stretch 
across light-years under extraordi- 



nary conditions (such as send- 
ing an emergency messenger-com- 
ponent home) or to clump into 
a single magnetic unit in order to 
shift through space and explore the 
galaxy. Both officially and person- 
ally — but most of all personally 
— he represents a case in point. 

The case is one having to do with 
the relative importance of the made 
thing and its maker. 

It was, we all know, the armored 
horseman who dominated the early 
wars of the Middle Ages in Europe. 



140 




But, knowing this, it is still wise 
to remember that it was not the iron 
shell that made the combination of 
man and metal terrible to the en- 
emy, — but rather the essentially 
naked man inside the shell. Later, 
French knights depending on their 
armor went down before the cloth- 
yard shafts of unarmored footmen 
with bows, at Crecy and Poitiers. 

And what holds true for armor 
holds true for the latest develop- 
ments of our science as well. It is 
not the spacecraft or the laser on 
which we will find ourselves depend- 
ing when a time of ultimate decision 
comes, but the naked men within and 
behind these things. When that time 
comes, those who rank the made 
thing before its maker will die as 
the French knights died at Crecy 
and Poitiers. This is a law of na- 
ture as wide as the universe, which 
Harry Brennan, totally unsuspecting, 
was to discover once more for us, 
in his personal capacity. 

P ersonally, he was in his mid-twen- 
ties, unremarkable except for 
two years of special training with 
the John Paul Jones and his superb 
ph3^sical condition. He was five- 
eleven, a hundred seventy-two 
pounds, with a round, cheerful face 
under his brown crew-cut hair. I 
was Public Relations Director of the 
Project that sent him out; and I 
was there with the rest to slap him 
on the back the day he left. 

“Don’t get lost, now,” said some- 
one. Harry grinned. 

“The way you guys built this 
thing,” he answered, “if I got lost 
the galaxy would just have to shift 



itself around to get me back on 
plot.” 

There was an unconscious arro- 
gance 'hidden in that answer, but no 
one marked it at the time. It was 
not the hour for suspicions. 

He climbed into the twelve-foot 
tall control suit that with his sepa- 
rate living tank were the main com- 
ponents of the John Paul Jones and 
took off. Up in orbit, he spent some 
thirty-two hours testing to make 
sure all the several thousand other 
component parts were responding 
properly. Then he left the solar sys- 
tem. 

He clumped together his com- 
ponents, made his first shift to orbit 
Procyon — and from there com- 
menced his explorations of the stars. 
In the next nine weeks, he ac- 
cumulated literally amazing amounts 
of new information about the neai- 
by stars and their solar systems. 
And — this is an even better index 
of his success — located four new 
worlds on which men could step 
with never a spacesuit or even a 
water canteen to sustain them. 
Worlds so like Earth in gravity, 
atmosphere and even flora and 
fauna, that they could be colonized 
tomorrow. 

Those were his first four worlds. 
On the fifth he encountered his fate 
— a fate for which he was uncon- 
sciously ripe. 

The fact was the medical men and 
psychologists had overlooked a fac- 
tor — a factor having to do with 
the effect of Harry’s official John 
Paul Jones self upon his entirely 
human personal self. And over nine 
weeks this effect changed Harry 



IN THE BONE 



141 




witihout his ever having suspected 
it. 

You see, nothing seemed barred 
to him. He could cross light-years 
by touching a few buttons. He could 
send a sensing element into the 
core of the hottest star, into the 
most poisonous planetary atmo- 
spheres or crushing gravities, to look 
around as if he were down there in 
person. From orbit, he could crack 
open a mountain, burn off a forest 
or vaporize a section of icecap in 
search of information just by tapping 
the energy of a nearby sun. And 
so, subtly, the unconscious arrogance 
bom during two years of training, 
that should have been noted in him 
at take-off from Earth, emerged 
and took him over . — until he felt 
that there was nothing he could not 
do; that all things must give way- to 
him; that he was, in effect, master 
of the universe. 

The day may come when a man 
like Harry Brennan may hold such 
a belief and be justified. But not 
yet. On the fifth Earthlike world 
he discovered — World 1242 in his 
records — Harry encountered the 
proof that his belief was unjustified. 

II 

T he .world was one which, from 
orbit, seemed to be the best of 
all the planets which he had dis- 
covered were suitable for human 
settlement; and he was about to go 
down to its surface personally in the 
control-suit, when his instruments 
picked out something already down 
there. 

It was a squat, metallic pyramid 



about the size of a four-plex apart- 
ment building; and it was radiating 
on a number of interesting frequen- 
cies. Around its base there was me- 
chanical movement and an area of 
cleared ground. Further out, in the 
native forest, were treaded vehicles 
taking samples of the soil, rock and 
vegetation. 

Harry had been trained for all con- 
ceivable situations, including an en- 
counter with other intelligent, space- 
going life. Automatically, he struck 
a specific button, and immediately 
a small torpedo-shape leaped away 
to shift through alternate space and 
back to Earth with the information 
so far obtained. And a pale, thin 
beam reached up and out from the 
pyramid below. Harry’s emergency 
messenger component ceased to ex- 
ist. 

Shaken, but not yet really wor- 
ried, Harry struck back instantly 
with all the power his official self 
could draw from the GO-type sun, 
nearby. 

The power was funnelled by some 
action below, directly into the pyra- 
mid itself; and it vanished there as 
indifferently as the single glance of a 
sunbeam upon a leaf. 

Harry’s mind woke suddenly to 
some understanding of what he had 
encountered. He reached for the con- 
trols to send the John Paul Jones 
shifting into the alternate universe 
and away. 

His hands never touched the con- 
trols. From the pyramid below, a 
blue lance of light reached up to 
paralyze him, select the controlsuit 
from among the other components 
and send it tumbling to the plane- 



142 



IF 




tary surface below like a swatted 
insect. 

But the suit had been designed 
to protect its occupant, whether he 
himself was operative or not. At fif- 
teen hundred feet, the drag chute 
broke free, looking like a silver 
cloth candle-snuffer in the sunlight; 
and at five hundred feet the retro- 
rockets cut in. The suit tumbled to 
earth among some trees two kilo- 
meters from the pyramid, with 
Harry inside bruised, but released 
from his paralysis. 

From the pyramid, a jagged arm 
of something like white lightning 
lashed the ground as far as the suit, 
and the suit’s outer surface glowed 
cherry-red. Inside, the temperature 
suddenly shot up fifty degrees; in- 
stinctively Harry hit the panic button 
available to him inside the suit. 

The suit split down the center 
like an overcooked frankfurter and 
spat Harry out; he rolled among the 
brush and fernlike ground cover, 
six or seven meters from the suit. 

F rom the distant pyramid, the 
lightning lashed the suit, break- 
ing it up. The headpiece rolled 
drunkenly aside, turning the dark 
gape of its interior toward Harry 
like the hollow of an empty skull. 
In the dimness of that hollow Harry 
saw the twinkle of his control but- 
tons. 

The lightning vanished. A yellow 
lightness filled the air about Harry 
and the dismembered suit. There was 
a strange quivering to the yellow- 
ness; and Harry half smelled, half 
tasted the sudden, flatbite of ozone. 
In the headpiece a button clicked 



without being touched; and the suit 
speaker, still radio-connected with 
the recording tank in orbit, spoke 
aloud in Harry’s voice. 

“Orbit . .” it said. “. into . 
going ...” 

These were, in reverse order, the 
last three words Harry had recorded 
before sighting the pyramid. Now, 
swiftly gaining speed, the speaker be- 
gan to recite backwards, word for 
word, everything Harry had said in- 
to^ it in nine weeks. Faster it went, 
and faster, until it mounted to a 
chatter, a gabble, and finally a whine 
pushing against the upper limits of 
Harry’s auditory register. 

Suddenly, it stopped. 

The little clearing about Harry 
was full of silence. Only the odd and 
distant creaking of something that 
might have been a rubbing branch 
or an alien insect, came to Harry’s 
ears. Then the speaker spoke once 
more. 

“Animal . .” it said flatly in 
Harry’s calm, recorded voice and 
went on to pick further words from 
the recordings, “. beast. You . 
were an animal . wrapped in . 
made clothing. I have stripped you 
back to . animal again. Live, 
beast ...” 

Then the yellowness went out of 
the air and the taste of ozone with 
it. The headpiece of the dismembered 
suit grinned, empty as old bones in 
the sunlight. Harry scrambled to his 
feet and ran wildly away through 
the trees and brush. He ran in panic 
and utter fear, his lungs gasping, his 
feet pounding the alien earth, until 
the earth, the trees, the sky itself 
swam about him from exhaustion; 



IN THE BONE 



143 




and he fell tumbling to earth and 
away into the dark haven of un- 
consciousness. 

W hen he woke, it was night, and 
he could not quite remember 
where he was or why. His thoughts 
seemed numb and unimportant. But 
he was cold, so he blundered about 
until he found the standing half- 
trunk of a lighting-blasted tree and 
crept into the burned hollow of its 
interior, raking frill-edged, alien 
leaves about him out of some half- 
forgotten instinct, until his own body- 
warmth in the leaves formed a co- 
coon of comfort about him; and he 
slept. 

From then on began a period in 
which nothing was very clear. It was 
as if his mind had huddled itself 
away somehow like a wounded ani- 
mal and refused to think. There 
was no past or future, only the end- 
less now. If now was warm, it had 
always been warm; if dark — it had 
always been dark. He learned to 
smell water from a distance and go 
to it when he was thirsty. He put 
small things in his mouth to taste 
them. If they tasted good he ate 
them. If he got sick afterwards, he 
did not eat them again. 

Gradually, blindly, the world 
about him began to take on a cer- 
tain order. He came to know where 
there were plants with portions he 
could eat, where there were small 
creatures he could catch and pull 
apart and eat and where there was 
water. 

He did not know how lucky he 
was in the sheer chance of finding 
flora and fauna on an alien world 



that was edible — let alone nourish- 
ing. He did not realize that he had 
come down on a plateau in the 
tropical highlands, with little vari- 
ation in day and night temperature 
and no large native predators which 
might have attacked him. 

None of this, he knew. Nor would 
it have made any difference to him 
if he had, for the intellectual center 
of his brain had gone on vacation, so 
to speak, and refused to be called 
back. He was, in fact, a victim of 
severe psychological shock. The 
shock of someone who had come to 
feel himself absolute master of a 
universe and who then, in a few 
short seconds, had been cast down 
from that high estate by something 
or someone inconceivably greater, in- 
to the state of a beast of the field. 

But still, he could not be a true 
beast of ^e field, in spite of the 
fact his intellectual processes had 
momentarily abdicated. His percep- 
tive abilities still worked. His eyes 
could not help noting, even if in- 
curiously, the progressive drying of 
the vegetation, the day-by-day shift- 
ing in the points of setting and rising 
of the sun. Slowly, instinctively, the 
eternal moment that held him 
stretched and lengthened until he be- 
gan to perceive divisions within it 
— a difference between now and 
was, between now and will be. 

Ill 

T he day came at last when he saw 
himself. 

A hundred times he had crouched 
by the water to drink and, lowering 
his lips to its surface, seen color and 

IF 



144 





IN THE BONE 



145 



shape rising to meet him. The hun- 
dredth and something time, he check- 
ed, a few inches above the liquid 
plane, staring at what he saw. 

For several long seconds it made 
no sense to him. Then, at first 
slowly, then with a rush like pain 
flooding back on someone rousing 
from the anesthesia of unconscious- 
ness, he recognized what he saw. 

Those were eyes at which he star- 
ed, sunken and dark-circled under a 
dirty tangle of hair. That was a nose 
jutting between gaunt and sunken 
cheeks above a mouth, and there was 
a chin naked only because once an 
ultrafine laser had burnt out the 
thousand and one roots of the beard 
that grew on it. That was a man he 
saw — himself. 

He jerked back like someone who 
has come face-to-face with the devil. 
But he returned eventually, because 
he was thirsty, to drink and see him- 
self again. And so, gradually, he got 
used to the sight of himself. 

So it was that memory started to 
return to him. But it did not come 
back quickly or all at once. It re- 
turned instead by jerks and sudden, 
partial revelations — until finally 
the whole memory of what had hap- 
pened was back in his conscious mind 
again. 

But he was really not a man again. 

He was still essentially what the 
operator of the pyramid had broken 
him down into. He was still an ani- 
mal. Only the memory and imagin- 
ings of a man had returned to live 
like a prisoner in a body that went 
on reacting and surviving in the bes- 
tial way it had come to regard as 
natural. 



But his animal peace was broken. 
For his imprisoned mind worked 
now. With the controlsuit broken up, 
— he had returned to the spot of 
its destruction many times, to gaze 
beastlike at the rusting parts — his 
mind knew he was a prisoner, alone 
on this alien world until he died. To 
know that was not so bad, but re- 
membering this much meant remem- 
bering also the existence of the some- 
one or something that, had made him 
a prisoner here. 

The whoever it was who was in 
the pyramid. 

That the pyramid might have been 
an automated, mechanical device 
never entered his mind for a mo- 
ment. There had been a personal, 
directed, living viciousness behind 
the announcement that had con- 
demned him to live as a beast. No, 
in that blank-walled, metallic struc- 
ture, whose treaded mechanical ser- 
vants still prospected through the 
woods, there was something alive — 
something that could treat the awe- 
some power of a solar tap as a hu- 
man treated the attack of a mos- 
quito — but something living. Some 
being. Some Other, who lived in the 
pyramid, moving, breathing, eating 
and gloating — or worse yet, entire- 
ly forgetful of what he had done to 
Harry Brennan. 

And now that he knew that the 
Other was there, Harry began to 
dream of him nightly. At first, in 
his dreams, Harry whimpered with 
fear each time the dark shape he 
pursued seemed about to turn and 
show its face. But slowly, hatred 
came to grow inside and then out- 
side his fear. Unbearable that Harry 



146 



IF 




should never know the face of his 
destroyer. Lying curled in his nest 
of leaves under the moonless, star- 
brilliant sky, he snarled, thinking of 
his deprivation. 

Then hate came to strengthen him 
in the daylight also. From the be- 
ginning he had avoided the pyramid, 
as a wild coyote avoids the farm- 
yard where he was once shot by 
the farmer. But now, day after day, 
Harry circled closer to the alien 
shape. From the beginning he had 
run and hidden from the treaded 
prospecting machines. But now, 
slowly, he grew bolder, standing 
close enough at last to touch them 
as they passed. And he found that 
they paid no attention to him. No 
attention at all. 

H e came to ignore them in turn, 
and day by day he ventured 
closer to the pyramid. Until the 
morning came when he lay, silently 
snarling, behind a bush, looking out 
across the tread-trampled space that 
separated him from the nearest cop- 
per-colored face of the pyramid. 

The space was roughly circular, 
thirty meters across, broken only 
by a small stream which had been 
diverted to loop inwards toward the 
pyramid before returning to its orig- 
inal channel. In the bight of the 
loop a machine like a stork straddled 
the artificial four-foot-wide channel, 
dipping a pair of long necks with 
tentacle-clustered heads into the 
water at intervals. Sometimes Harry 
could see nothing in the tentacles 
when they came up. Occasionally 
they carried some small water crea- 
ture which they deposited in a tank. 



Making a perfect circle about the 
tramped area, so that the stork like 
machine was guarded within them, 
was an open fence of slender wands 
set upright in the earth, far enough 
apart for any of the machines that 
came and went to the forest to pass 
between any two of them. T^ere 
seemed to be nothing connecting 
the wands, and nothing happened 
to the prospecting machines as they 
passed through — but the very pur- 
poselessness of the wands filled 
Harry with uneasiness. 

It was not until after several days 
of watching that he had a chance to 
see a small native animal, frightened 
by something in the woods behind it, 
attempt to bolt across a comer of 
the clearing. 

As it passed between two of the 
wands there was a waveriness in the 
air between them. The small animal 
leaped high, came down and lay still. 
It did not move after that, and later 
in the day, Harry saw the indifferent 
treads of one of the prospecting ma- 
chines bury it in the trampled earth 
in passing. 

That evening, Harry brought sev- 
eral captive, small animals bound 
with grass up to the wand line and 
thrust them through, one by one at 
different spots. All died. 

The next night he tried pushing 
a captive through a small trench 
scooped out so that the creature 
passed the killing line below ground 
level. But this one died also. For 
several days he was baffled. Then 
he tried running behind a slow- 
moving machine as it returned and 
tying a small animal to it with grass. 

For a moment as the front of 



IN THE BONE 



147 




the machine passed through, he 
thought the little animal would live. 
But then, as the back of the machine 
passed the line, it, too, died. 

Snarling, Harry paced around out- 
side the circle in the brush until the 
sun set and stars filled the moonless 
sky. 

I n the days that followed, he 
probed every gap in the wand- 
fence, but found no safe way through 
it. Finally, he came to concentrate 
on the two points at which the di- 
verted stream entered and left the 
circle to flow beneath the storklike 
machine. 

He studied this without really 
knowing what he was seeking. He 
did not even put his studying into 
words. Vaguely, he knew that the 
water went in and the water came 
out again unchanged; and he also 
wished to enter and come out safe- 
ly. Then, one day, studying the 
stream and the machine, he noticed 
that a small creature plucked from 
the water by the storklike neck’s 
mass of tentacles was still wriggling. 

The evening, at twilight, while 
there was still light to see, he waded 
up the two-foot depth of the stream 
to the point where the killing line 
cut across its watery surface and 
pushed some more of his little ani- 
mals toward the line underwater. 

Two of the three surfaced imme- 
diately, twitched and floated on 
limply, to be plucked from the water 
and cast aside on the ground by 
the storklike machine. But the third 
swam on several strokes before sur- 
facing and came up living to scram- 
ble ashore, race for the forest and 



be killed by wands further around 
the circle. 

Harry investigated the channel be- 
low the killing line. There was water 
there up to his mid-thigh, plenty to 
cover him completely. He crouched 
down in the water and took a deep 
breath. 

Ducking below the surface, he 
pulled himself along with his finger- 
tips, holding himself close to the 
bottom. He moved in as far as the 
tentacled ends. These* grabbed at 
him, but could not reach far enough 
back to touch him. He saw that they 
came within a few inches of the 
gravel bottom. 

He began to need air. He backed 
carefully out and rose above the 
water, gasping. After a while his 
hard breathing stopped, and he sat 
staring at the water for a long while. 
When it was dark, he left. 

The next day he came and crept 
underwater to the grabbing area of 
the storklike machine again. He 
scooped out several handfuls of the 
gravel from under the place where 
the arms grabbed, before he felt a 
desperate need for .air and had to 
withdraw. But that day began his 
labors. 

IV 

F our days later the bottom under 
the grasping tentacles was 
scooped out to an additional two 
feet of depth. And the fifth twilight 
after that, he pulled himself, dripping 
and triumphant, up out of the bend 
of the diverted stream inside the 
circle of the killing wands. 

He rested and then went to the 



148 



IF 




pyramid, approaching it cautiously 
and sidelong like a suspicious ani- 
mal. There was a door in the side he 
approached through which he had 
seen the prospecting machines trun- 
dle in and out. In the dimness he 
could not see it; and when he 
touched the metallic side of the struc- 
ture, his fingers, grimed and tough- 
ened from scrabbling in the dirt, told 
him little. But his nose, beast-sen- 
sitive now, located and traced the 
outline of the almost invisible crack 
around the door panel by its reek 
of earth and lubricant. 

He settled down to wait. An hour 
later, one of the machines came 
back. He jumped up, ready to fol- 
low it in; but the door opened just 
before it and closed the minute it 
was inside — nor was there any room 
to squeeze in beside it. He hunkered 
down, disappointed, snarling a little 
to himself. 

He stayed until dawn and watched 
several more machines enter and 
leave. But there was no room to 
squeeze inside, even with the small- 
est of them. 

During the next week or so he 
watched the machines enter and leave 
nightly. He tied one of his small ani- 
mals to an entering machine and 
saw it pass through the entrance alive 
and scamper out again with the 
next machine that left. And every 
night his rage increased. Then, word- 
lessly, one daytime after he had seen 
a machine deep in the woods lurch 
and tilt as its tread passed over a 
rock, inspiration took him. 

That night he carried through the 
water with him several canteloupe- 
sized stones. When the first machine 



came back to the pyramid, in the 
moment in which the door opened 
before it, he pushed one of the rocks 
before the right-hand tread. The ma- 
chine, unable to stop, mounted the 
rock with its right tread, tilted to 
the left and struck against that side 
of the entrance. 

It checked, backed off and put 
out an arm with the grasping end to 
remove the rock. Then it entered 
the opening. But Harry was already 
before it, having slipped through 
while the door was still up and the 
machine, busy pulling the stone 
aside. 

He plunged into a corridor of 
darkness, full of clankings and 
smells. A little light from the open- 
ing behind him showed him a fur- 
ther, larger chamber where other 
machines stood parked. He ran 
toward them. 

Long before he reached them, the 
door closed behind him, and he was 
in pitch darkness. But the clanking 
of the incoming machine was close 
behind him, and the adrenalinized 
memory of a wild beast did not fail 
him. He ran, hands-outstretched, di- 
rectly into the side of the parked 
machine at which he had aimed and 
clambered up on it. The machine en- 
tering behind him clanked harmless- 
ly past him and stopped moving. 

He climbed cautiously down in 
the impenetrable darkness. He could 
see nothing; but the new, animal 
sensitivity of his nose offered a sub- 
stitute for vision. He moved like a 
hunting dog around the chamber, 
sniffing and touching; and slowly 
a clear picture of it and its treaded 
occupants built up in his mind. 



IN THE BONE 



149 




He was still at this when suddenly 
a door he had not seen opened al- 
most in his face. He had just time 
to leap backwards as a smaller ma- 
chine with a boxlike body and a 
number of upward-thrusting arms 
entered, trundled to the machine 
that had just come back and began 
to relieve the prospecting machine 
of its sample box, replacing it with 
the one it carried itself. 

This much, in the dim light from 
the open door, Harry was able to 
see. But then, the smaller machine 
turned back toward the doorway; 
and Harry, waking to his opportuni- 
ty, ducked through ahead of it. 

H e found himself in a corridor 
dimly lit by a luminescent strip 
down the center of its ceiling. The 
corridor was wide enough for the 
box-collecting machine to pass him; 
and, in fact, it rolled out around him 
as he shrank back against one metal 
wall. It went on down the corridor, 
and he followed it into a larger room 
with a number of machines, some 
mobile, some not, under a ceiling lit 
as the corridor had been with a 
crossing transluscent strip. 

In this area all the machines avoid- 
ed each other — and him. They 
were busy with each other and 
at other incomprehensible duties. 
Hunched and tense, hair erect on 
the back of his neck and nostrils 
spread wide, Harry moved through 
them to explore other rooms and 
corridors that opened off this one. 
It took him some little time; but he 
discovered that they were all on a 
level, and there was nothing but ma- 
chines in any of them. He found 



two more doors with shallow steps 
leading up to them, but these would 
not open for him; and though he 
watched by one for some time, no 
machine went up the steps and 
through it. 

He began to be conscious of thirst 
and hunger. He made his way back 
to the door leading to the chamber 
where the prospecting machines were 
parked. To his surprise, it opened 
as he approached it. He slipped 
through into darkness. 

Immediately, the door closed be- 
hind him; and sudden panic grabbed 
him, when he found he could not 
open it from this side. Then, self- 
possession returned to him. 

By touch, smell and memory, he 
made his way among the parked ma- 
chines and down the corridor to the 
outside door. To his gratification, this 
also opened when he came close. He 
slipped through into cool, fresh 
outer air and a sky already graying 
with dawn. A few moments later, 
wet but free, he was back in the 
woods again. 

From then on, each night he re- 
turned. He found it was not neces- 
sary to do more than put any size- 
able object before a returning ma- 
chine. It would stop to clear the path, 
and he could enter ahead of it. Then, 
shortly after he was inside, a box- 
collecting machine would open the 
inner door. 

Gradually, his fear of the machines 
faded. He came to hold them in a 
certain contempt. They always did 
the same thing in the same situ- 
ation, and it was easy to trick or 
outmaneuver them. 

But the two inner doors of the 

IF 



150 




machine area with the steps would 
not open to him; and he knew the 
upper parts of the pyramid were still 
unexplored by him. He sniffed at 
the cracks of these door, and a 
scent came through — not of lubri- 
cating medium and metal alone, 
but of a different musky odor that 
raised the hairs on the back of his 
neck again. He snarled at the doors: 

H e went back to exploring min- 
utely the machine level. The 
sample boxes from the prospecting 
machines, he found, were put on 
conveyorbelt-like strips that floated 
up on thin air through openings in 
the ceiling — but the openings were 
too small for him to pass through. 
But he discovered something else. 
One day he came upon one of the 
machines taking a grille off the face 
of one of the immobile devices. It 
carried the grille away, and he ex- 
plored the opening that had been 
revealed. It was the entrance to a 
tunnel or duct leading upward; and 
it was large enough to let him enter 
it. Air blew silently from it; and the 
air was heavy with the musky odor 
he had smelled around the doors 
that did not open. 

The duct ,tempted him, but fear 
held him back. The machine came 
back and replaced the grille; and 
he noticed that it fitted into place 
with a little pressure from the out- 
side, top and bottom. After the ma- 
chine had left he pressed, and the 
grille fell out into his hands. 

After a long wait, he ventured 
timorously into the tube — but a 
sudden sound like heavy breathing 
mixed with a wave of a strong, 



musky odor came at him. He backed 
out in panic, fled the pyramid and 
did not come back for two days. 

When he came back, the grille was 
again neatly in place. He removed it 
and sat a long time getting his cour- 
age up. Finally, he put the grille up 
high out of reach of the machine 
which had originally removed it 
and crawled into the duct. 

He crept up the tube at an angle 
into darkness. His eyes were useless, 
but the musky odor came strongly 
at him. Soon, he heard sounds. 

There was an occasional ticking, 
then a thumping or shuffling sound. 
Finally, after he had crawled a long 
way up through the tube, there was 
a sound like a heavy puffing or 
hoarse breathing. It was the sound 
that had accompanied the strength- 
ening of the musky odor once be- 
fore; and this time the scent came 
strong again. 

He lay, almost paralyzed with ter- 
ror in the tube, as the odor grew in 
his nostrils. He could not move un- 
til sound and scent had retreated. 
As soon as they had, he wormed his 
way backward down to the lower 
level and freedom, replaced the 
grille and fled for the outside air, 
once again. 

But once more, in time, he came 
back. Eventually returned to explore 
the whole network of tubes to which 
the one he had entered connected. 
Many of the branching tubes were 
too small for him to enter, and the 
biggest tube he could find led to 
another grille from which the musky- 
smelling air was blasted with force. 

Clearly it was the prime mover 
for the circulation of air through 



IN THE BONE 



151 




the exhaust half of the pyramid’s 
ventilating system. Harry did not 
reason it out to himself in those in- 
tellectual terms, but he grasped the 
concept wordlessly and went back 
to exploring those smaller tubes that 
he could crawl into. 

These, he found, terminated in 
grilles set in their floors through 
which he could look down and catch 
a glimpse of some chamber or other. 
What he saw was mainly incompre- 
hensible. There were a number of 
corridors, a number of what could 
be rooms containing fixed or mova- 
ble objects of various sizes and 
shapes. Some of them could be the 
equivalent of chairs or beds — but 
if so, they were scaled for a being 
plainly larger than himself. The 
lighting was invariably the low-key 
illumination he had encountered in 
the lower, machine level of the pyra- 
mid, supplied by the single translu- 
cent strip running across the ceil- 
ing. 

Occasionally, from one grille or 
another, he heard in the distance the 
heavy sound of breathing, among 
other sounds, and smelled more 
strongly the musky odor. But for 
more than a week of surreptitious 
visits to the pyramid, he watched 
through various grilles without see- 
ing anything living. 

V 

H owever, a day finally came 
when he was crouch^, star- 
ing down into a circular room con- 
taining what might be a bed shape, 
several chair shapes and a number 
of other fixed shapes with variously 



spaced and depthed indentations in 
their surfaces. In. a far edge of the 
circular room was a narrow alcove, 
the walls of which were filled with 
ranked indentations, among which 
several lights of different colors 
winked and glowed. 

Suddenly, the dim illumination of 
the room began to brighten. The 
illumination increased rapidly, so 
that Harry cringed back from the 
grille, lifting a palm to .protect his 
dimness-accustomed eyes. At the 
same moment, he heard approaching 
the sound of heavy breathing and 
sniffed a sudden increase in the 
musky odor. 

He froze. Motionless above the 
grille, he stopped even his breath- 
ing. He would have stopped his 
heart if he could, but it raced, shak- 
ing his whole body and sounding 
its rapid beat in his ears until he 
felt the noise of it must be booming 
through the pyramid like a drum. 
But there was no sign from below 
that this was so. 

Then, sliding into sight below him, 
came a massive figure on a small 
platform that seemed to drift with- 
out support into the room. 

The aperture of the grille was 
small. Harry’s viewpoint was cramp- 
ed and limited, looking down direct- 
ly from overhead. He found himself 
looking down onto thick, hairless 
brown-skinned shoulders, a thick 
neck with the skin creased at the 
back and a forward-sloping, hairless 
brown head, egg-shaped in outline 
from above, with the point forward. 

Foreshortened below the head and 
shoulders was a bulging chinline 
with something like a tusk showing; 



152 



IF 




it had a squat, heavy, hairless, brown 
body and thick short forearms with 
stubby claws at the end of four- 
fingered hands. There was some- 
thing walruslike about the tusks and 
the hunching; — and the musky odor 
rose sickeningly into Harry’s human 
nostrils. 

The platform slid level with the 
alcove, which was too narrow for it 
to enter. Breathing hoarsely, the 
heavy figure on it heaved itself sud- 
denly off the platform into the al- 
cove, and the stubby hands moved 
over the pattern of indentations. 
Then, it turned and heaved itself out 
of the alcove, onto the flat, bed sur- 
face adjoining. Just as Harry’s gaze 
began to get a full-length picture of 
it, the illumination below went out. 

Harry was left, staring dazzled in- 
to darkness, while the heavy breath- 
ing and the sound of the figure 
readjusting itself on the bed surface 
came up to his ears. After a while, 
there was no noise but the breath- 
ing. But Harry did not dare move. 
For a long time he held his cramped 
posture, hardly breathing himself. 
Finally, cautiously, inch-by-inch, he 
retreated down the tube, which was 
too small to let him turn around. 
When he reached the larger tubes, he 
fled for the outside and the safety 
of the forest. 

The next day, he did not go near 
the pyramid. Or the next. Every 
time he thought of the heavy, brown 
figure entering the room below the 
grille, he became soaked with the 
clammy sweat of a deep, emotional 
terror. He could understand how the 
Other had not heard him or seen 
him up behind the grille. But he 



could not understand how the alien 
had not smelled him. 

Slowly, however, he came to ac- 
cept the fact that the Other had not. 
Possibly the Other did not have a 
sense of smell. Possibly . there 
was no end to the possibilities. The 
fact was that the Other had not 
smelled Harry — or heard him — 
or seen him. Harry was like a rat 
in the walls — unknown because he 
was unsuspected. 

A t the end of the week, Harry was 
once more prowling around back 
by the pyramid. He had not intended 
to come back, but his hatred drew 
him like the need of a drug addict 
for the drug of his addiction. He 
had to see the Other again, to feed 
his hate more surely. He had to look 
at the Other, while hating the alien, 
and feel the wild black current of 
his emotions running toward the 
brown and hairless shape. At night, 
buried in his nest of leaves, Harry 
tossed and snarled in his sleep, 
dreaming of the small stream back- 
ing up to flood the interior of the 
pyramid, and the Other drowning 
— of lighting striking the pyramid 
and fire racing through it — of the 
Other burning. His dreams became 
so full of rage and so terrible that 
he woke, twisting and with the few 
rags of clothing that still managed 
to cling unnoticed to him, soaked 
with sweat. 

In the end, he went back into the 
pyramid. 

Daily he went back. And gradual- 
ly, it came to the point where he was 
no longer fearful of seeing the Oth- 
er. Instead, he could barely endure 



IN THE BONE 



153 




the search and the waiting at the 
grilles until the Other came into 
sight. Meanwhile, outside the pyra- 
mid in the forest, the frill-edged 
leaves began to dry and wither and 
drop. The little stream sank in its 
bed — only a few inches, but enough 
so that Harry had to dig out the 
bottom of the streambed under the 
killing barrier in order to pass safely 
underwater into the pyramid area. 

One day he noticed that there 
were hardly any of the treaded ma- 
chines out taking samples in the 
woods any more. 

He was on his way to the pyramid 
through the woods, when the reali- 
zation struck him. He stopped dead, 
freezing in midstride like a hunting 
dog. Immediately, there flooded in- 
to his mind the memory of how the 
parking chamber for the treaded ma- 
chines, inside the base of the pyra- 
mid, had been full of unmoving ve- 
hicles during his last few visits. 

Immediately, also, he realized the 
significance of the drying leaves, the 
dropping of the water level of the 
stream. And something with the ur- 
gency of a great gong began to ring 
and ring inside him like the pealing 
of an alarm over a drowning city. 

Time had been, when there had 
been no pyramid here. Time was 
now, with the year fading and the 
work of the. collecting machines al- 
most done. Time would be, when 
the pyramid might leave. 

Taking with it the Other. 

He began to run, instinctively 
toward the pyramid. But, when he 
came within sight of it, he stopped. 
For a moment he was torn with in- 
decision, an emotional maelstrom of 



fear and hatred all whirling together. 
Then, he went on. 

H e emerged a moment later, drip- 
ping, a fist-sized rock in 
each hand, to stand before the 
closed door that gave the machines 
entrance to the pyramid. He stood 
staring at it, in broad daylight. He 
had never come here before in full 
daylight, but his head now was full 
of madness. Fury seethed in him, 
but there was no machine to open 
the door for him. It was then that 
the fury and madness in him might 
have driven him to pound wildly 
on the door with his stones or to 
wrench off one of the necks of the 
storklike machine at the stream and 
try to pry the door open. Any of 
these insane things he might have 
done and so have attracted discovery 
and the awesome power of the ma- 
chinery and killing weapons at the 
command of the Other. Any such 
thing he might have done if he was 
simply a man out of his head with 
rage — but he was no longer a man. 

He was what the Other had made 
him, an animal, although with a man 
locked inside him. And like an ani- 
mal, he did not rave or rant, any 
more than does the cat at the mouse- 
hole, or the wolf waiting for the 
shepherd to turn in for the night. In- 
stead, without further question, the 
human beast that had been Harry 
Brennan — that still called himself 
Harry Brennan, in a little, locked- 
away, back corner of its mind — 
dropped on his haunches beside the 
door and hunkered there, panting 
lightly in the sunlight and waiting. 
Four hours later, as the sun was 



154 



IF 





IN THE BONE 



155 



dropping close to the treetops, a 
single machine came trundling out 
of the woods. Harry tricked it with 
one of his stones and, still carrying 
the other, ran into the pyramid. 

He waited patiently for the small 
collecting machine to come and 
empty out the machine returned 
from outside, then dodged ahead of 
it, when it came, into the interior, 
lower level of the pyramid. He made 
his way calmly to the grille that 
gave him entrance to the ventilating 
system, took out the grille and en- 
tered ^e tube. Once in the system, 
he crawled through the maze of 
ductwork, until he came at last to 
the grille overlooking the room with 
the alcove and the rows of indenta- 
tions on the alcove walls. 

When he looked down through the 
grille, it was completely dark below. 
He could hear the hoarse breathing 
and smell the musky odor of the 
Other, resting or perhaps asleep, on 
the bed surface. Harry lay there 
for a number of slow minutes, smell- 
ing and listening. Then he lifted the 
second rock and banged with it upon 
the grille. 

F or a second there was nothing 
but the echoing clang of the 
beaten metal in the darkness. Then 
the room suddenly blazed with light, 
and Harry; blinking his blinded eyes 
against the glare, finally made out 
the figure of the Other rising up- 
right upon the bed surface. Great, 
round, yellow eyes in a puglike face 
with a thick upper lip wrinkled over 
two tusks stared up through the 
grille at Harry. 

The lip lifted, and a bubbling roar 



burst from the heavy fat-looking 
shape of the Other. He heaved his 
round body off the bed surface and 
rolled, waddling across the floor to 
just below the grille. 

Reaching up with one blunt-claw- 
ed hand, he touched the grille, and 
it fell to the floor at his feet. Left 
unguarded in the darkness of the 
ductwork, Harry shrank back. But 
the Other straightened up to his full 
near six-and-a-half feet of height 
and reached up into the ductwork. 
His blunt clawed hand fastened on 
Harry and jerked. Off balance, 
Harry came tumbling to the floor of 
the chamber. 

A completely human man probably 
would have stiffened up and broken 
both arms, if not his neck, in such a 
fall. Harry, animal-like, attempted 
to cling to the shape of the Other 
as he fell, and so broke the impact 
of his landing. On the floor, he let 
go of the Other and huddled away 
from the heavy shape, whimpering. 

The Other looked down, and his 
round, yellow eyes focused on the 
stone Harry had clung to even 
through his fall. The Other reached 
down and grasped it, and Harry gave 
it up like a child releasing something 
he has been told many times not to 
handle. The Other made another, 
lower-toned, bubbling roar deep in 
his chest, examining the rock. ITien 
he laid it carefully aside on a low 
table surface and turned back to 
stare down at Harry. 

Harry cringed away from the alien 
stare and huddled into himself, as 
the blunt fingers reached down to 
feel some of the rags of a shirt that 
still clung about his shoulders.

IF 




The Other rumbled interrogative- 
ly at Harry. Harry hid his head. 
When he looked up again, the Other 
had moved over to a wall at the 
right of the alcove and was feeling 
about in some indentations there. He 
bubbled at the wall, and a second 
later Harry’s voice sounded eerily 
in the room. 

. You are . the one 1 . 
made a beast . .” 

Harry whimpered, hiding his head 
again. 

“You can’t . .” said Harry’s 
voice, . even speak now. Is . 
that so . .” 

Harry ventured to peek upward 
out of his folded arms, but ducked 
his head again at the sight of the 
cold, yellow eyes staring down at 
him. 

“. I thought . you would be 
. dead by now,’’ said the disem- 
bodied voice of Harry, hanging in 
the air of the chamber. “. Amaz- 
ing . survival completely without 
. equipment. Must keep you 
now . .’’ The eyes, yellow as topaz, 
considered Harry, huddled abjectly 
on the floor, “. cage . collector’s 
item. 

The alien revolved back to the 
indentations of the wall a little way 
from the alcove. The broad, fleshy 
back turned contemptuously on 
Harry, who stared up at it. 

The pitiful expression of fear on 
Harry’s face faded suddenly into a 
soundless snarl. Silently, he uncoiled, 
snatched up the rock the Other had 
so easily taken from him, and sprang 
with it onto the broad back. 

As he caught and clung there, 
one arm wrapped around a thick 



neck, the stone striking down on the 
hairless skull, his silent snarl burst 
out at last into the sound of a 
scream of triumph. 

The Other screamed too — a 
bubbling roar — as he clumsily 
turned, trying to reach around him- 
self with his thick short arm^ and 
pluck Harry loose. His claws raked 
Harry’^ throat-encircling arm, and 
blood streamed from the arm; but 
it might have been so much stage 
make-up for the effect it had in 
loosening Harry’s hold. Screaming, 
Harry continued to pound crushingly 
on the Other’s skull. With a furious 
spasm, the alien tore Harry loose, 
and they both fell on the floor. 

The Other was first up; and for 
a second he loomed like a giant over 
Harry, as Harry was scrambling to 
his own feet and retrieving the fallen 
rock. But instead of attacking, the 
Other flung away, lunging for the 
alcove and the control indentations 
there. 

Harry reached the alcove entrance 
before him. The alien dodged away 
from the striking rock. Roaring and 
bubbling, he fled waddling from his 
human pursuer, trying to circle 
around the room and get back to 
the alcove. Half a head taller than 
Harry and twice Harry’s weight, he 
was refusing personal battle and 
putting all his efforts into reaching 
the alcove with its rows of indented 
controls. Twice Harry headed him 
off; and then by sheer mass and des- 
peration, the Other turned and burst 
past into the alcove, thick hands 
outstretched and grasping at its walls. 
Harry leaped in pursuit, landing and 
clinging to the broad, fleshy back. 



IN THE BONE

The other stumbled under the 
added weight, and fell, face down. 
Triumphantly yelling, Harry rode 
the heavy body to the floor, striking 
at the hairless head . and striking 
. and striking . 

VI 

S ometime later, Harry came wear- 
ily to his senses and dropped a 
i ock he no longer had the strength 
lO lift. He blinked around himself 
like a man waking from a dream, 
becoming aware of a brilliantly lit 
room full of strange shapes — and 
of a small alcove, the walls of which 
were covered with rows of indenta- 
tions, in which something large and 
dead lay with its head smashed into 
ruin. A deep, clawing thirst rose to 
take Harry by the throat, and he 
staggered to his feet. 

He looked longingly up at the dark 
opening of the ventilator over his 
head; but he was too exhausted to 
jump up, cling to its edge and pull 
himself back into the ductwork, 
from which he could return to the 
stream outside the pyramid and to 
the flowing water there. He turned 
and stumbled from the chamber in- 
to unfamiliar rooms and corridors. 

A brilliant light illuminated every- 
thing around him as he went. He 
sniffed and* thought he scented, 
through the musky reek that filled 
the air about him, the clear odor 
of water. Gradually, the scent grew 
stronger and led him at last to a 
room where a bright stream leaped 
from a wall into a basin where it 
pooled brightly before draining 
away. He drank deeply and rested. 



Finally, satiated, he turned away 
from the basin and came face-to- 
face with a wall that was all-reflect- 
ing surface; and he stopped dead, 
staring at himself, like Adam before 
the Fall. 

It was only then, with the upwell- 
ing of his returning humanness, that 
he realized his condition. And words 
spoken aloud for the first time in 
months broke harshly and riistily 
from his lips like the sounds of a 
machine unused for years. 

“My God!” he said, croakingly. 
“I’ve, got no clothes left!” 

And he began to laugh. Cackling, 
cackling rasping more unnaturally 
even than his speech, his laughter 
lifted and echoed hideously through 
the silent, alien rooms. But it was 
laughter all the same — the one 
sound that distinguishes man from 
the animal. 

H e was six months after that 
learning to be a complete hu- 
man being again and finding out how 
to control the pyramid. If it had not 
been for the highly sophisticated 
safety devices built into the alien 
machine, he would never have lived 
to complete that bit of self-educa- 
tion. 

But finally he mastered the con- 
trols and got the pyramid into orbit, 
where he collected the rest of his 
official self and shifted back through 
the alternate universe to Earth. 

He messaged ahead before he 
landed; and everybody who could 
be there was on hand to meet him 
as he landed the pyramid. Some of 
the hands that had slapped his back 
on leaving were raised to slap him 



158 



IF 




again when at last he stepped forth 
among them. 

But, not very surprisingly, when 
his gaunt figure in a spare coverall 
now too big for it, with shoulder- 
length hair and burning eyes, stepped 
into their midst, not one hand fin- 
ished its gesture. No one in his right 
senses slaps an unchained wolf on 
the back; and no one, after one look, 
wished to risk slapping the man who 
seemed to have taken the place of 
Harry. 

Of course, he was still the same 
man they had sent out — of course 
he was. But at the same time he was 
also the man who had returned 
from a world numbered 1242 and 
from a duel to the death there with 
a representative of a race a hun- 
dred times more advanced than his 



own. And in the process he had been 
pared down to something very basic 
in his human blood and bone, some- 
thing dating back to before the first 
crude wheel or chipped flint knife. 

And what was that? Go down into 
the valley of the shades and demand 
your answer of a dead alien with his 
head crushed in, who once treated 
the utmost powers of modern human 
science as a man treats the annoy- 
ance of a buzzing mosquito. 

Or, if that once-mighty traveller 
in spacegoing pyramids is disin- 
clined to talk, turn and inquire of 
other ghosts you will find there — 
those of the aurochs, the great cave 
bear and the woolly mammoth. 

They, too, can testify to the ef- 
fectiveness of naked men.

AND 

CRY 



Dear Editor: 

I tbink If bad a great year in 
^65! In my opinion, the serials de- 
cide whether a mag will fly or 
flop, and If s really airborne. Here 
are the four serials rated in order. 

1. Skylark DuQuesne — I have 
to admit that before I read this 
yarn, I was a little leary. I had 
never read any of Doc Smith's 
works before, and I was wondering 
how I would take to the five part- 
er (thank God it turned out igood!). 
All I have to say is that if this 
is space opera, I like it. $ 

2. Retie fs War — This light ad- 
venture by Mr. Laumer deserves 
quite a band. His characters are 
unique and I praise his fertile 
imagination. Some parts were 
strictly from Robin Hood, but as a 
whole I found it very entertaining. 
I'm really looking forward to more 
of Retief. ’ 

3. Star Child — This was a very 
good' serial, though my interest lag- 
ged in spots. I'm glad to hear that 
another Reef story is in the mak- 
ing. This is one of the better series 
that I've read. 

4. Altar at Ascone — I had to 
rate this fourth, mostly because it 
wasn't long enough. I enjoy longer 



serials and would like to have seen 
it in three parts. I'm glad to see that 
he has a short novel in the March 
66 issue. 

I like your policy of one new 
writer in each issue. I was about to 
put in a plea in this letter for some 
articles on story writing, fandom, 
etc., until I got my April issue. I 
really enjoyed Lin Carter's piece 
on fandom. 

Do you think it would be possible 
to reproduce If and Galaxy cov- 
ers? And thinking of covers, I 
couldn't believe my eyes when I 
found out that Morrow did the April 
cover. It's just not his style. Then 
I really got a shock when I saw the 
illos for Earthblood. They look the 
work of Morrow or Wood. 

I haven't gotten down to Hedn- 
lein's new novel yet, but I'm hop- 
ing it will be a Hugo winner. Looks 
like another good year. 

Finally, do you read all the 
manuscripts yourself, or do you 
have first and second readers? — 
Mike Buchta, 5821 W. Adler, Mil- 
waukee, Wisconsin 53214. 

# I read them all myself — all 
4,000 a year of them. That's why 
they call me Blinky. — Editor,

Dear Editor: 

I have been reading your maga- 
zine for about a year now and think 
it is the best one on the market to- 
day. Your June issue was excellent 
with M android being one of the best 
complete short novels I have read. 

Thanks for the Our Man in Fan- 
dom features. I’m learning things 
about it I never knew existed before. 

Earthhlood is the best novel 1 
have read for a long time although 
I have not read all of it yet. I think 
it is even better than The Moon Is 
a Harsh Mistress. Laumer and 
Brown make a very good team. The 
description of the beautiful Terran 
park was wonderful. I found myself 
walking around it without a care 
in the world. 

In your Sept. ’65 issue you pub- 
lished a story by E. Clayton Mc- 
Carty called The Planet Player. I’ve 
read it about a dozen times now. 
Let’s see more of him. 

I’m glad to see that no science 
articles will appear in your mag, 
I like them but it would spoil If as 
they are not suitable for it. 

Is there any special address for 
back issues? I want to get back is- 
sues of W.O.T. (another excellent 
mag.) and If. 

Congratulations on getting the 
Doc Smith Skylark award. You de- 
served it. — Nick Grimshawe, RR- 
#2, AUiaton, Ontario, Canada.

Dear Editor: 

Toys for Debbie by David A. Kyle 
rang the bell for me. What a story! 
And what toys! ALL the stories 
were well wor^ reading — the illus- 
trations were wonderful — your 
‘‘letters’' department was fine! 

If I sound extra enthusiastic it’s 
because I AM! I’m a lover of “dif- 
ferent” stories from way back. I’m 
pushing 70 now. My birthday is Jan- 
uary 19, hubby’s is January 18 — 
do we have any “birthday twins” 
among your readers? 

My hubby and I have one entire 
room lined with weird and fantastic 
books and magazines. We were in- 
timate friends of the late author of 
the weird and uncanny, H. P. Love- 
craft. We spent many pleasant night- 
time hours with this fantastic man, 
listening to him read his manu- 
scripts aloud under flickering gas- 
light. This was in the early ’20s, 
when everybody didn’t have electri- 
city in their homes! Nights seemed 
darker, then . and as H. P. L. 
loved darkness, we three reveled in 
it, as we pictured monsters, hobgob- 
lins, shapeless creatures of his own 
imagination and witches steeped in 
witchcraft, while Lovecraft nibbled 
on a chicken leg and enjoyed our 
hospitality! 

I could ramble on and on about 
our association with this master of 
the weird. We visit his grave often, 
and we have many pictures of H. P. 
L. and even one of his parents! We 
revere his memory and in his honor 
we peruse all “different” publica- 
tions on the newsstands. Yours wins 
top honors with us! Also your cover 
appealed greatly to me, and it illus- 
trated your feature story, a corker

Dear Editor: 

In your June, 1966 issue of If 
there appears an article entitled A 
Relativistic Dilemma in which you 
present the complications connected 
with relativistic mass and energy 
conservation, wherein you invite the 
ambitious reader to come up with a 
solution. 

I spend most of my time reading 
science fiction and I study a little 
nuclear physics on the side, so I 
figured I was well enough equipped 
to tackle the problem. Here’s what 
I came up with: 

The Lorentz contraction theory 
states that, as the velocity of a body 
increases, its diameter in the direc- 
tion of the acceleration decreases 
proportionately. Hence at the speed 
of light one not only has an infinite 
mass but also a two-dimensional 
mass. 

However, the infinite mass con- 
cept seems somewhat odd, because as 
you mentioned in your article light 
is composed of particles (photons) 
which indeed do travel at the speed 
of light, and yet possess no infinite 
mass. 

I propose a new theory. When a 
mass reaches the speed of light it 
is converted to light itself, and the 
light has an energy equivalent to 
the mass according to e=mc2. This 
might also account for the dimen- 
sional problem. How many dimen- 
sions does energy have? Certainly 



not three. — Jim Murray, 150 Har- 
rison Avenue, Jersey City 4, New

Dear Editor: 

I have just finished your May ’66 
issue and, to be euphemistic, I think 
the art work on the cover is atro- 
cious. For one thing, it is terribly 
unscientific, since it is probably un- 
likely that a creature, such as the 
one pictured, with three-digited 
claws for hands, lack of binocular 
vision and apparent lack of ears and 
nose, would be technically advanced 
enough to be flying around in space- 
ships. But this is a flyspeck. What 
bothered me was that in no way 
could I stretch my imagination 
enough to make it jibe with Silkies 
in Space, which it was supposed to 
represent. But never fear. Like all 
know-it-alls, I have a solution to 
this problem. 

First, you could give the axe to 
all your cover artists and simply 
reprint Picasso’s nightmares on the 
cover. This would remove your every 
cover from the realm of science and 
put them in the realm of art, where 
anything goes. No problem of rep- 
resentation, because they could rep- 
resent anything you say and no one 
could refute you. 

Or you could reprint the covers 
from the old pulp magazines, which, 
I am told, characteristically showed 
a horny green grasshopper-man ab- 
ducting some sexy babe clad in a 
transparent space suit. At least this 
made sense. Almost. Well, anyway, 
it certainly would improve the cover. 
By the way, Earthblood is excellent.

“We’re looking for people 
who want to write” 

-r: ' 



By Gordon Carroll 

Director, Famous Writers School. Former 
editor. Reader's Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
1 would like to test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you can be 
trained to become a successful writer. 

Several years ago, we started the 
Famous Writers School. Our aim was to 
help qualified people acquire the skills 
they need to break into print. We poured 
everything we knew about writing into 
a new kind of professional training 
course, which you take at home and in 
your free time. After a solid grounding 
in fundamentals, ypu get advanced train- 
ing in the specialty of your choice— Fic- 
tion, Non-Fiction, Advertising or Busi- 
ness Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor spends up to two hours 
analyzing your work. He bfiie-pencils 
corrections right on it — much as an 
editor does with established writers. 
Then he returns it to you with a long 
personal letter of advice and specific 
recommendations. 

This training works well. Our siudents 
have sold ihcir writing to more than 100 



publications including Reader s Digest, 
True, Redbook. ^ 

Stephen Novak of Wayne, N. J., says, 
“I just received a check from Ellery 
Queen's Mystery Magazine. That’s 11 
stories sold in six months.” Doris Steb- 
bins of S. Coventry, Conn., who has sold 
six stories to Woman’s Day for $2,050 
writes, “Taking your Course has made 
it all possible.” 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for th® School’s Aptitude 
Test. If you test well, or offer other evi- 
dence of writing ability you may enroll. 
But there is no obligation to do so.
