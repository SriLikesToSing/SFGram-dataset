AIR and SPACE 



H appen you don't sleep well at 
night, and provided you live 
somewhere in the more-or-less East- 
ern part of the United States, you 
may well find yourself listening to 
the radio between the hours of mid- 
night and five A.M. What brightens 
the air at those hours over radio 
station WNBC in New York is an 
all-night talk show whose presiding 
genius is a man named Long John 
Nebel. 

What Long John likes in guests 
for his radio program is the special- 
ist in the far-out. One of the things 
he likes is science fiction, and he 
has had any number of science-fic- 
tion writers on the show at one time 
or another. Lester del Rey is a reg- 
ular; so is Mike Girsdansky (who 
has been writing those fascinating 
future-science articles for us in 
Worlds of Tomorrow) ; so, for that 
matter, is the undersigned. Others 
who have appeared with Long John 
are James Blish, Theodore Sturgeon, 
Harry Harrison, Sam Moskowitz, 
Mel Hunter, John Campbell, Isaae 
Asimov — well, the list could go on 
indefinitely, for John Nebel has fill- 
ed a lot of air hours in the past 
decade. 

It was on a Long John show a 
couple of yfears ago, as a matter of 
fact, that your editor made some re- 
marks about flying saucers which 
attracted the attention of a man 
named George W. Earley. 

George Earley is the Connecticut 
state representative for an organiza- 
tion called NICAP — National In- 
vestigating Committee for Aerial 



Phenomena — and he called us up 
in some irritation. You don't accept 
the evidence for flying saucers, he 
charged; and we admitted that that 
was true enough; we weren't a bit 
convinced. But have you really made 
any sort of investigation? he asked. 
Have you really looked, at the evi- 
dence? Or have you just made up 
your mind without giving the UFO- 
logists a fair chance? 

We had to confess to Earley that 
he had called that one accurately. 
What he said was true. Everything 
we knew about Unidentified Flying 
Objects, contactees, space-people and 
so on could be put in a couple of 
newspaper headlines, because that 
essentially was where we'd got what 
little information we had. And when 
Earley pressed us we had to agree 
that this was not a particularly 
desirable way to make a decision. 

So we promised to do better. 

T hat was a little over a year ago. 

Since then, as time and oppor- 
tunity permit, we have been repair- 
ing this obvious gap in our educa- 
tion as rapidly as we can. 

It isn't as easy as you might 
think. To begin with, all saucerdom 
is divided into two parts. Part 1 
might be called the NICAP wing of 
the movement, whose essential thesis 
is approximately as follows: “There 
have been over 6,000 reports of un- 
identified celestial objects in the 
past few years. They cannot all be 
mistakes or hoaxes. As a minimum, 
these facts demand a full-scale in- 
vestigation by responsible authori- 



4 





ties, conducted in public and with no 
attempt to disguise or protect under 
the guise of military security their 
findings. As a maximum, we consid- 
er it beyond doubt that the Earth is 
being visited by creatures from an- 
other planet.” 

Part 2 is what are called the 
“contactees”, and what they say is 
approximately this: “Earth has not 
only been visited from outer space, 
but many of us have talked with 
the spacemen, ridden in their strange 
saucer-shaped craft and learned 
from them many priceless secrets of 
science, technology and moral law 
— besides being given advance no- 
tice of the assassination of President 
Kennedy, the flareup of war in Viet- 
nam and the success of our and the 
Russian space probes.” 

The NICAP group (which we are 
using in this sense to include a num- 
ber of men and women who, for one 
reason or another, don't belong to 
NICAP — but do share with it the 
opinion that the general case is 
proved and certainly needs more in- 
vestigation, without going along with 
the claims of the contactees) in- 
cludes a lot of technical, scientific 
and professional people, and it goes 
to a lot of trouble to secure as much 
verification as it can for every re- 
port of UFO sightings. As a veteran 
of two. such attempts ourselves, we 
can testify that this is pretty hard 
to do. 

Consider, for example, the case of 
New Mexico State Patrolman Lonnie 
Zamora. About a year ago Zamora, 
patrolling the area south of the 
town of Socorro, New Mexico, ra- 
dioed his headquarters that he had 
observed what looked like the land- 
ing of some sort of strange aircraft 
a few miles south of the town and 
was proceeding to investigate. His 



desk sergeant dispatched another 
car, but by the time it grot there 
there was nothing to be seen except 
Zamora himself, his car and certain 
marks in the ground. According to 
Zamora, the “aircraft” had been 
metallic, bright, fairly large and not 
like anything he had ever seen be- 
fore. It seemed to land on four 
struts, and when it took off again 
it did so with the’ accompaniment 
of a bluish glow from underneath. 

Although Socorro is ringed by 
radar (it is on the fringe of 
the White Sands Proving Ground 
and as well guarded as any place 
in the world against aerial intru- 
sion), no trace of any aircraft had 
been detected by radar or by visual 
spotters. The marks on the ground 
consisted of four crude pits — ap- 
proximately where Zamora stated 
the struts of the object had rested — 
and a greasewood bush that was in 
flames, presumably set alight by the 
“bluish glow” from under the object 
at takeoff. 

Some weeks later we had occasion 
to be in New Mexico and, accom- 
panied by Jack Williamson — known 
to his students at Eastern New 
Mexico Reserve University as Pro- 
fessor John Stewart Williamson, 
Ph.D., but to most of the rest of us 
as the author of scores of fine 
science-fiction stories over the past 
thirty-odd years — we made a side- 
trip of a couple of hundred miles to 
look over the Zamora sighting. 

The physical evidence was just as 
it had been described. There were 
the four rough pits — since sur- 
rounded by heaps of pebbles by 
someone, presumably a UFOlogist 
desirous of keeping them from being 
trampled out of shape. There w?o 
the greasewood bush; it had grown 
new shoots, but it was still apparent 



3 




that it had been burned not long 
before. The site was down in a little 
arroyo. About forty feet away was 
the small mesa where Zamora had 
parked his police car and got out to 
investigate. From mesa to arroyo the 
lino cf .sight was clear and the 
distance not much. Obviously there 
would have been no difficulty in 
seeing whatever was there, given a 
reliable witness. 

The apparent next question was, 
was Zamora a reliable witness? Ac- 
cording tc the testimony of his ser- 
geant, his fellow patrolmen and 
townspeople, there was no doubt at 
all. “If Lonnie said he saw some- 
thing, he saw it. He might be mis- 
taken, but he’d never lie.” Was he 
likely to be mistaken? Not according 
to Professor Lincoln La Paz of the 
University of New Mexico, for 
whom Zamora had functioned as a 
volunteer meteorite spotter for years. 
Zamora was a trained observer, as 
well as a man possessed of the most 
towering reputation for honesty this 
writer can recall coming across in 
a long time. 

Of course, in the long run this 
whole case rests on Zamora. The 
physical evidence was nothing — 
anybody could have jabbed a couple 
of holes in the desert; a match could 
have ignited the bush as easily as a 
“bluish glow”. There were vague 
reports of other witnesses, but none 
that could be tracked down — at 
least one that Williamson and the 
undersigned concluded, rather def- 
initely, never would be tracked 
down, because the geography of the 
case was such that we didn’t believe 
he ever existed in the first place. 

So where does that leave us? 

A bout where we started, we’re 
afraid . and that’s the story 



of the whoie flying-saucer situation. 

The centactees would say this is 
design on the part of the* space peo- 
ple — they’re just playing with us, 
you see. The NICAPers maintain 
that this is irrelevant. Never mind 
why it’s so hard to get conclusive, 
irrefutable evidence of even one 
sighting — out of the endless thou- 
sands of reports — just concentrate 
on the number, the quality of the 
observers (many of them trained 
and of excellent repute) and the 
logic of the situation. Half of our 
physical laws rest on worse statis- 
tical evidence than the case for fly- 
ing saucers, say the NICAP people. 

Last year NICAP published a 
book called The UFO Evidence , 
which summarizes the circumstances 
surrounding 746 carefully selected 
sightings. Some are accompanied by 
photographic evidence. Many are 
supported by the testimony of as- 
tronomers, meteorologists, radar op- 
erators, airline pilots or others who 
are in a position to look at the sky 
with some expertise. 

At about the same time, Donald 
H. Menzel, Director of the Harvard 
Observatory, and Lyle Boyd, con- 
tributor to this and many other 
science-fiction magazines over the 
years, published a book called The 
World 0 , the Flying Saucers , in 
which they went over the evidence 
for a large selection of sightings 
and came to the conclusion that 
every one of them was explicable in 
terms of planets seen through a 
haze, odd cloud formations, weather 
balloons or other natural events. 

So where does that leave us? 

Still about where we started, we’re 
afraid. But we’re still checking. And 
it may be that we’ll have something 
more definite to tell you one of 
these days. — THE EDITOR

T he bolt of flame from the gun 
hissed by, twenty millimeters 
from his nose. 

There was silence, and then the 
door opened behind him. Light foot- 
steps approached, muffled by the 
fine, deadly dust on the floor. Gull 



craned to see the person approach- 
ing, but he was tied too tightly for 
that. 

“You are most foolhardy, Meesta 
Gull,” said the girl’s soft voice. “I 
beg you, do not drop the fuse again 
or I must resort to more ’arsh 
methods.” And from the corner of 
his eye Johan Gull saw her slim 



7 



figure swiftly stoop to recover the 
ball-meter length of rubbery plastic 
fuse-cord. 

As she attempted to jam it into 
his mouth again he jerked his head 
aside and managed to ask, “Why 
are you doing this?” 

“Why?” There was the soft hint 
of a laugh in her voice. “Ah, why 
indeed!” She caught hi? head in 
the crook of an arm and, surpris- 
ingly strong, held it still. He felt the 
stiff strand thrust between his teeth, 
tasted again the acrid chemical fla- 
vor. When she had done the same 
thing before he had been able to 
spit the fuse out before she could 
ignite it. She did not chance his 
dropping it again; her flame-gun 
hissed, and the end of the fuse be- 
f*n to sizzle with a tiny green 
spark. 

“I think,” she whispered, “that it 
is because I love you, Meesta Gull.” 
And he felt something like a quick 
touch of lips, a scent of perfume 
that carried even above the pyro- 
technic reek of the sputtering fuse; 
and then the door closed softly and 
he was alone in the room that was 
about to become an enormous bomb. 

T he green halo hissed the length 
of the dangling fuse toward his 
lips. Johan Gull, estimating seconds 
by the beat of his pulse where his 
wrists were tied to the wall, timed 
its course at perhaps two millimet- 
ers a second. Say four minutes be- 
fore it reached his lips. 

He sighed. It was a nuisance to 
think of his career ending like this 
— a daring foray into enemy terri- 
tory to break up a smuggling opera- 



tion of the Black Hats . complete 
success, the ring destroyed, the doz- 
en men in charge of it dead . 
and then to allow himself to be 
tricked by the one person who sur- 
vived, a slip of a girl. If he had 
only not answered her cry for help! 

But he had. And he had found 
himself trussed up in a karate grip, 
then tied to the wall. And now — he 
had four minutes of life, or actually 
a bit less, unless he thought of 
something rather quickly. 

He could, of course, drop the 
fuse at any time before the spark 
touched his flesh and his instictive 
reaction made him drop it. But the 
girl had said, and he had no reason 
to think that she lied, that the pow- 
dery dust she had spread about the 
floor was gunpowder. In the un- 
confined space of the room it would 
perhaps not explode; it might only 
flare up like the igniting of a gas 
jet; but it would kill Johan Gull 
nonetheless. Could he scrape a spot 
clean with his feet and drop the 
burning fuse there? 

Experimentally he shifted position 
and tried. It was slow work. The 
floor was rough-cast cement and the 
tiny particles of explosive powder 
adhered like lint on wool. By ar- 
duous scraping with the side of his 
shoe Gull managed to get a six-inch 
square mostly free of the stuff. But 
it was not good enough, he saw. A 
pale powdery haze clung to the cre- 
vices. It was not much, but it was 
too much; it would take very little 
to flash and carry the spark of the 
fuse to the main mass; and two 
eminutes were irretrievably gone. 

Could he sneeze it out? It was 



8 



IF 




at least worth a try, he thought; 
but annoyingly his nose would not 
itch, there was no trace of nasal 
drip, all he managed to do was snort 
at the tiny green light and make it 
flare brighter for a moment. He re- 
doubled his efforts to slip his wrists 
out of their bonds. The thing could 
be done, he discovered with tem- 
pered pleasure. The girl had tied him 
well; but she was only a girl and 
not strong enough, or cruel enough, 
to cut deeply into his wrists. The 
cord stretched slowly and minutely; 
he would be able to work himself 
free. 

But not in four minutes. Still 
more certainly not in the minute or 
less that was all he had left. Already 
he could feel the heat of the glowing 
end of the fuse on his chin. He was 
forced to lean forward for fear of 
igniting his goatee, but soon it would 
be too close for that to help. 

There really was only one thing to 
do, thought Johan Gull regretfully. 

He nibbled the short remaining 
length of fuse up to his lips and, 
wincing from the pain but denying 
it control of his actions, chewed out 
the spark. 

A quarter of an hour later he was 
free of his bonds and through 
the door. 

The girl was long gone, of course. 
Spirited little devil. Gull wished her 
well; he bore her no animus for tak- 
ing one round of The Game, wished 
only that he had been able to see 
her more clearly, for her voice was 
sweet. Perhaps they would meet 
again. 

Rubbing his wrists, Gull looked 



about the dingy shed in which ne 
had been held captive. He knew this 
part of Marsport less well than al- 
most any of the rest of the red 
planet, but recognized this rundown 
corridor as a slum. An uncollected 
trash basket kicked over on its side 
spewed refuse across the steel deck- 
ing. On the black wall that had 
housed him some despairing wretch 
had scrawled, We Are Property! The 
air pressure was low, but it reeked 
of dirt, drugs and vice. 

Gull shrugged, lighted a cigarette, 
turned his back on the room th^t 
had so nearly been his death ti 3 
and strode toward the sign marked 
Subway. He would be late, and .5 
was a stickler for promptness. But 
he paused to glance back again, and 
thought of the girl who had trapped 
him. He had liked her voice. She 
had had a charming fragrance. It 
had been cool of her to have ignited 
the fuse while she was still in the 
room; he might have dropped it and 
then and there blown both of them 
halfway to Deimos. And she had 
said that she loved him. 

II 

T he entrance to Security lay 
through a barber shop. Gull 
hung his coat on a rack and sat 
back in the chair, musing about the 
adventure he had just had and won- 
dering about the next to come. In 
the corridor outside a chanting mob 
of UFOlogists demanded equal rights 
for spacemen; Gull had nearly been 
caught in the marching front of 
their demonstration as he entered 
the shop.

He submitted to being lathered, 
shaved, talced and brushed, but the 
jacket he was helped^ into was not 
his own. His hand in the pocket 
closed over the familiar shape of the 
pencil-key. He let himself out the 
back way of the barber shop and 
opened the private door to .5’s of- 
fice. 

“Sorry I’m late, sir,” he apologiz- 
ed to the ancient, leathery figure 
with the hooded eyes behind the 
desk. 

The Old Man’s secretary, McIn- 
tyre, looked up from his eternal 
notebook. From the hooks and slants 
in that little leather-bound pad mes- 
sages flew to every corner of the 
Solar System, alerting a battalion of 
Marines on Callisto, driving a Black 
Hat front into bankruptcy in Stutt- 
gart, thrusting pawns against a raid 
on Darkside Mercury, throwing an 
agent to his death here on Mars. To 
McIntyre it was all the same. He 
was a dark young man who had 
never been known to show emotion. 
He said calmly, “.5 is a stickler for 
promptness, Gull.” 

Gull said, “1 ran into difficulties. 
Something didn’t want me to get 
here today, I’m afraid.” 

Was it his imagination, or did .5’s 
imperturbable face show the vestige 
of a frown? McIntyre put down his 
pencil and regarded Gull thought- 
fully. “I think,” he said, “that you’d 
better tell .5 just what you mean 
by that.” 

“Oh, just that I had difficulties, 
sir.” Quickly Gull sketched the 
events of the day. “Afraid I allowed 
myself to be decoyed. Shouldn’t 
have, of course. But next thing you 



know there was a flame-pencil in 
my ribs, I was tied up and a lighted 
fuse between my teeth. Quite un- 
pleasant, as the floor was covered 
with gunpowder. I would have been 
here sooner, but I didn’t quite trust 
myself to spit the fuse clear of the 
gunpowder.” 

Eyebrows raised, McIntyre glanc- 
ed at .5, as if to find a sign on that 
stoic countenance. Then he rose de- 
liberately, walked to a file, pulled 
out a sheaf of papers in a folder 
marked, Gull, Johan , Personnel Re- 
cords of. He glanced through them 
thoughtfully. 

“I see,” he said at last. “Well, 
that’s neither here nor there.” He 
replaced the folder and sat beside 
Gull. “Johan,” he said earnestly, “.5 
wants me to caution you that your 
next assignment may mean unusual 
danger.” 

“Really, sir? Oh, delightful!” 

“More than you think, perhaps,” 
said McIntyre darkly. “It isn’t mere- 
ly our colleagues in the Black Hats 
this time. It’s mob hysteria, at least. 
Perhaps something far more sinister. 
Something’s up in Syrtis Major.” 

A fter fourteen years as an agent 
and innumerable hearings of 
those words, or of words very much 
like them, still a thrill tingled up the 
spine of Johan Gull. Something's up 
in Syrtis Major — or Lacus Solis. 
Or the Southern Ice Cap. And he 
would be off again, off in the gra- 
tification of that headiest of addic- 
tions, the pitting of one’s wits and 
fine-trained body against the best 
the other side could come up with. 
Afid they were resourceful devils,

he thought, with the journeyman's 
unseltish admiration for a skilled 
worker at his own trade. Time and 
again it had taken all he possessed 
to win tnrough against their strength 
and trices. And if .5 felt it neces- 
sary to caution him that this com- 
ing expiou would be trickier than 
u^uai, u would indeed be something 
to remember. 

“Mnasning,’’ ne cried. “Would you 
care to Drier me on it?” 

But McIntyre was shaking his 
head. 

*11 you’d managed to get here 
on schedule — ” he said; and then, 
“As it is, .0 has some rather urgent 
callers due in, let me see, mark! 
Forty seconds.” 

“1 see, said Johan Gull. 

“However,” McIntyre went on, 
“research has the whole picture for 
you. Vou’li draw whatever supplies 
are necessary in Supply. Then Trav- 
el & transport can arrange for your 
travel and transport. Good-by, Gull.” 

“Right, sir,’ said Gull, memoriz- 
ing his instructions. His lips moved 
for a second and he nodded. “Got 
it. So long, McIntyre. Good-by, sir.” 
He did not wait for an answer. It 
was well known that .5 disliked 
wasting breath on trivia, above all 
on the conventional exchange of 
greetings and farewells and unmeant 
inquiries as to the unimportant as- 
pects of one s health that passed for 
“politeness”. 

In the office these perfunc- 
tory pleasances were skipped. 
Gull let himself out, his heart pound- 
ing in spite of himself, and started 
toward the Research office and a 
new job. 



I t was rather a nuisance, thought 
Gull as he lay sprawled in the 
barber’s chair, to go again through 
the process of being lathered, shav- 
ed, talced and brushed. But it did 
have advantages. One advantage wai 
that it gave one a moment to one- 
self now and then. 

Johan Gull was a healthy young 
animal. He had an educated interest 
in food, drink and the attractions 
of women; a moment for reverie 
taken perforce, like this, was a lux- 
ury ... the sort of luxury his active 
body was inclined to deny him when 
it had a choice. He dreamed away 
the moments, hardly hearing the 
barber-robot’s taped drone — “How 
you think the Yanks gonna do? Say, 
you see this new ragazz ’ on the TV 
last night? Hoo!” — while his mind 
roamed the ochre wastes of Syrtis 
Major. He thought contentedly that 
he was ready for the assignment. 

The jacket he was helped to put 
on bore on its cuff a quite unduplic- 
able pattern of metal-linked lines 
and dots. Gull climbed the winding 
stairs down to the basement of the 
barber shop, held the sleeve to a 
scanning device and was admitted 
to the Research center. 

Lights, sounds and activity smote 
his senses. He blinked, pausing on 
the threshold of the room as the 
great steel door swung soundlessly 
closed behind him. 

As it never failed lo do, the busy 
hum of Research thrilled him with 
a sense of the vast massive scope of 
Security’s incredibly complex opera- 
tions. The chamber was more than 
thirty meters across. It was in the 
form of an amphitheater, with cir- 



12 



IF 




cles of desks descending toward the 
gFeat central dais. There on a pivot, 
its axis inclined an exact 24° 48’ 
from the vertical, the great globe of 
Mars majestically turned, it cities 
and traffieways and canals etched 
out in colors that were softly glow- 
ing or startlingly bright. Here a 
rhythmic green flash pinpointed one 
of Security’s agents on active duty. 
There a crimson warning signal 
winked the presence of a known 
enemy operative. Patches of blue 
and orange indicated areas of mili- 
tary buildup or of temporary calm; 
white flashes showed Black Hat 
strongpoints under surveillance; .5’s 
own bases were gold. 

Any Black Hat field man would 
gladly have paid his life, and a bit 
more, for five minutes inside the 
Research chamber. It was the most 
secret installation in all Security’s 
vast net. In it, any of the three 
hundred trained technicians seated 
at their rows of desks on each step 
of the circle could look up and, in 
a moment, identify a trouble signal, 
record a “mission accomplished”, 
demand and get a dossier on any 
adult Martian citizen or guest, or 
put into operation any of .5’s mag- 
nificently daring ventures. And what 
was most impressive about it all, 
thought Gull, was that this infinitely 
detailed accumulation of expertise 
was duplicated in full in one other 
place — in the fecund convolutions 
of .5’s busy brain. 

Gull observed that the appropriate 
face of Mars was toward him now. 
He quickly sought the lines of the 
canals, followed them to Syrtis Ma- 
jor, paused and frowned. 



The whole mass of the area was 
glowing with* a pale lavender radi- 
ance. 

G ull stood puzzled and faintly 
worried, until one of the girls 
at the circling desks rose and beck- 
oned him. As he approached she 
sat down again and waved him to 
a chair. “Good afternoon, Mr. 
Gull,” she said. “One moment un- 
til I get your account records.” 
Gull grinned, more amused than 
otherwise. “Oh, come off it, Glor- 
ia,” he said easily. “I know I was 
a stinker last night. But let’s not 
hold grudges.” 

She said stiffly, “Thank you for 
waiting, Mr. Gull. I have your rec- 
ords now.” 

Gull’s smile did not fade; he had 
observed the faint softening of the 
corners of her mouth. “Then let’s 
get to it,” he said genially. 

Her fingers had been busy on the 
console A faxed sheet emerged 
from a slit on the lip of her desk 
and she read it carefully, nodding. 

“Ah, yes. I thought so,” said the 
girl. “It’s that flying saucer affair 
in Syrtis Major.” 

Gull’s smile vanished. He smote 
his brow. “Flying saucers! Of 

course.” Comprehension overspread 
his face and he nodded'. “Saw the 
lavender on the globe, of course, but 
I must admit that for the moment 
I forgot my color-coding. Couldn’t 
remember that it meant flying sau- 
cers.” 

The girl was looking at him rue- 
fully. “Oh, dear,” she sighed. 

“Johan, you’ve just earned yourself 
a one-hour refresher. You know 5’s

a stickler for keeping color-coding 
in your head.’’ 

Gull groaned, but she was adam- 
ant. “No use fighting it. It’ll do you 
good, dear. Now about this flying 
saucer thing.” 

She glanced over the faxed sheet 
to refresh her memory, then spoke. 
“About two weeks ago,” she said, 
“a couple of old mica prospectors 
reeled in off the desert with a story 
about having been captured by 
strange, god-like creatures who land- 
ed near their camp in a flying sau- 
cer. There’s a transcript of their stor- 
ies on this tape — ” she took a spool 
from a drawer of her desk and 
handed it to Gull — “but essentially 
what it comes to is that they said 
these creatures are so far superior 
to humans that they consider us to 
be domesticated animals at best.” 

“Have the same feeling myself 
from time to time,” said Gull, pock- 
eting the spool. 

“I know that, dear. Anyway, no- 
body paid much attention. Not even 
when the prospectors swore they’d 
been given the power of walking 
through fire without being burned, 
putting themselves into catalepsy, 
even levitating themselves. However, 
then they began doing it in front of 
witnesses.” She took another spool 
of tape from her desk, then two 
more. 

“This one’s synoptic eye-witness 
accounts. This one’s a report from 
Engineering on possible ways that 
these phenomena may have been 
faked. And this other one’s a re- 
buttal from Unexplained Data, cov- 
ering similar unexplained phenom- 
ena of the past forty-odd years.” 



“Keep an even balance, don’t 
we?” grinned Gull, pocketing the 
spools. 

“For God’s sake, Johan, don’t 
get them mixed up. Well, anyway. 
About half of Syrtis Major decided 
the prospectors were fakes and tried 
to lynch them. The other half de- 
cided they were saints, and began 
to worship them. There's a whole 
revivalist religion now. They think 
that the saucer people own us — ” 

“Oh, yes,” said Gull. “I know 
about that part.” Indeed, it was 
hard not to have seen some of their 
riotous, chanting mass meetings, to 
dodge their interminable parades or 
to have failed to observe the slogans 
they had painted all over Marsport 
Dome. 

“Then you won’t need these other 
tapes.” Gloria sat back, frowning 
over her checklist. “Well, that’s 
about it, th — ” 

A bright golden light flashed on 
the girl’s desk. 

In the middle of a word she 
stopped herself, picked up the scar- 
let hushphone marked Direct and 
listened. She nodded. “Right, sir,” 
she said, replaced the phone, made 
a quick notation on the fax sheet 
before her and returned to Gull. 

“ — en,” she finished. “Any ques- 
tions?” 

“I think not.” 

“Then here are your operating 
instructions, submarine reservations, 
identification papers and disguise 
kit.” She handed him another reel 
of tape, a ticket envelope, a punch- 
coded card with a rather good like- 
ness of an idealized Johan Gull on 
it and a bottle of hair color.

IF 




Gull accepted them and stowed 
them away. But he paused at the 
gM’s desk, looking at her thought- 
fully. “Say. Would you like me to 
take you home tonight?” 

“Good heavens, no. I haven’t for- 
given you that much.” She made 
two check marks on the fax sheet. 
“Anyway, you won’t have time.” 
“Why do you say that? My sub- 
marine doesn’t leave for four 
hours — ” 

She smiled. “That call was from 
.5’s office.” 

Gull said gloomily. “Cripes. I sup- 
pose that means extra lines.” 
“Absolutely essential you com- 
plete two one-hour refresher courses 
before leaving,” the girl quoted. 
“McIntyre was quite emphatic. Said 
to remind you that .5 was a stick- 
ler for maintaining high levels of 
training; half-trained agents jeopar- 
dize missions.” Gull sighed but sur- 
rendered. No doubt .5 was right. 
“What’s the score?” he asked. 

“One hour in color-code recog- 
nition, but don’t think I reported 
you. Probably .5’s office was mon- 
itoring us. The other — let me see — 
oh, yes. Basic fuse-spitting, refresh- 
er course. Good luck, Johan. Drop 
me a card from Syrtis Major.” 

G ull kissed her lightly and left. 

He paused in the entranceway, 
studying his tickets and operating 
orders. He was faintly puzzled. 

That in itself was all right. He re- 
membered and liked the feeling. It 
was a good sign; it was the oper- 
ations where one couldn’t quite see 
the drift at first that often turned 
out to be the most exciting and re- 



warding. Yet he wished he knew 
how this mission was going to be. 

He turned his back on the flick- 
ering, darting lights that came from 
the great turning Martian globe and 
began to trudge up the stairs. All 
right so Syrtis Major had got the 
wind up. Mass hysteria, surely. In 
itself, that sort of thing was hardly 
worth Security’s while to bother 
with. There was no sign' of the op- 
position’s fine Macchiavellian hand 
in it, less reason to believe that 
there would be real danger. 

Yet McIntyre had warned of 
“unusual danger.” 

Surely he was wrong. Unless . 
Unless, thought Johan Gull with a 
touch of wonder, as he sat back 
in the barber’s chair and felt the 
warm lather gliding along his cheek, 
as the shoeshine robot waited to 
pull the lever that would drop him 
into the chute to Plans & Training 
. unless there really were people 
from flying saucers on Mars. 

Ill 

S mells of fungi, smells of the 
sea. The tang of hot-running 
metal machinery and the reek of 
stale sewage. Johan Gull expanded 
his chest and sucked in the thou- 
sand fragrances of the Martian 
waterfront as he shouted: “Boy! My 
bags. To my cabin, chop-chop!” 
He followed the lascar-robot at a 
slow self-satisfied pace, dropping 
ashes from his panatella, examining 
the fittings of the submarine with 
the knowing eye of the old Martian 
hand. He did indeed feel well 
pleased with himself.

in the role Costumery had set up 
for him, that of a well-to-do water 
merchant from the North PoLar Ice 
Cap, he had arrived at the docks in 
a custom Caddy. He cast largesse 
to the winds, ordered up a fine 
brandy to his cabin and immediate- 
ly plunged into a fresh-water bath. 
When you were playing a part, it 
was as well to play a wealthy one, 
he thought contentedly; and when 
he had luxuriated in his bath tor 
fifteen minutes and felt the »hrob of 
the hydrojets announce the ship’s 
getting under weigh, he emerged to 
dress and play his tapes with a light 
heart. 

To all intents and purposes, Gull 
must have seemed the very arche- 
type of a rich water vendor of sub- 
stantial, but not yet debilitating, age. 
He sat at ease, listening to the 
tapes through a nearly invisible 
earplug and doing his nails. He did 
not touch the eye patch which gave 
his face distinction, nor did he 
glance toward the framed portrait 
of Abdul Gamal Nasser behind 
which, he rather thought, a hidden 
camera-eye was watching his every 
move. Let them damned well lock. 
They could find nothing. 

He sat up, stretched, yawned 
lighted an expensive Pittsburgh 
stogie, blew one perfect smoke ring 
and resumed his task. 

The T Coronae Borealis was a 
fine old ship of the Finucane-Amer- 
ican line. As a matter of fact Johan 
Gull had voyaged in her more than 
a time or two before, and he looked 
forward with considerable pleasure 
to his dinner that night at the cap- 
tain’s table, to a spot of gambling 



in the card room, perhaps — who 
knew? — to a heady tete-a-tete with 
one of the lovely ladies ne had ob- 
served as he boarded. The voyage to 
Heliopolis was sixteen Hours by 
submarine, or just time enough for 
one’s glands to catch up with the 
fact that one had changed one’s 
mise-en-scene. Ballistic rockets, of 
course, would do it in fifty minutes. 
In Johan Gull’s opinion, ballistic 
travel was for barbs. And he was 
grateful that Mars’s atmosphere 
would not support that hideous com- 
promise between grace and speed, 
the jet plane. No, thought Gull com- 
placently. Of all the modes of trans- 
port he had sampled on six worlds 
and a hundred satellites, submarin- 
ing through the Martian canals was 
the only one fit for a man of taste. 

He snapped off the last of the 
tapes and considered his position. 
He heard with one ear the distant, 
feminine song of T Coronae’s nu- 
clear hydrojets. Reassuring. With 
every minute that passed they were 
two-fifths of a mile closer to the 
junction of four canals where He- 
liopolis, the Saigon of Syrtis Major, 
sat wickedly upon its web of waters 
and waited for its prey. 

Gull wondered briefly what he 
would find there. And as be won- 
dered, he smiled. 

T he knock on the door was firm 
without being peremptory. 
“Another brandy, sir?” called a 
voice from without. 

“No, thank you, steward,” said 
Gull. No Martian water vendor 
would arrive at dinner half slopped 
over. Neither would Gull — if not

IF 




because of the demands of his iole, 
then because of the requirements of 
good manners to the handiwork of 
T Coronae's master chef. Anyway, 
he observed by his wrist chronom- 
eter that it was time to think things 
over. 

He reviewed what he had heard 
on the tapes. 

Those two prospectors, he 
thought. Damned confusing thing. 

Their names, he recalled, were 
Harry Rosencranz and Clarence T. 
Reik. He had checked their dos- 
siers back to pre-emigration days. 
There had been nothing of interest 
there: Rosencranz an ex -unem- 

ployed plumber from Fort Leaven- 
worth, Kansas; Reik a cashiered in- 
structor in guerrilla tactics from the 
nearby Command & General Staff 
School. Like so many of Eartn’s 
castoffs, they had scraped together 
money to cover passage to Mars, 
and enough over to outfit one ex- 
pedition. They had managed to sub- 
sist ever since on what scrubby to- 
pazes they could scratch out of the 
sands of the Great Northern Desert. 
With, thought Hull, no doubt a spot 
of smuggling to make ends meet. 
Duty-free Martian souvenirs into 
the city, and chicle for the natives 
out. So much for Harry Rosencranz 
and Clarence T. Reik, thought Gull, 
blowing gently on the second coat of 
polish and commencing to buff his 
nails to a soft gleam. But it was 
not who the prospectors were that 
mattered. It was what they had had 
to say . and above all, what they 
had done. 

Gull paused and frowned. 

There was something he could 



not recognize in the atmosphere. A 
soft hint of fragrance — tantalizing 
— it strove to recall something to 
him, but he could not be sure what. 
A place? But what place? A girl? 

He shook his head. There could 
be no girl here. He put the thought 
from his mind and returned to the 
two prospectors and their strange 
story. 

T heir testimony far outran the 
parameters of normal credibil- 
ity. Gull could repeat the important 
parts of what they had said almost 
verbatim. Reik had been the more 
loquacious of the two — 

Well, Harry was like cooking up 
our mulligan outside the tent when 
I thought I heard him yell some- 
thing. I stuck — 

Q. One minute, Mr. Reik. You 
couldn’t hear what he said clearly? 

A. Well, not what you’d call 
clearly. You see I had the TV 
sound up pretty loud. Can’t hear 
much when you got the TV sound 
up pretty loud. 

Q. Go on. 

A. Well, I just reached out and 
turned off the set and stuck my 
neck out the flap. Geez! There it 
was. Big as life and twice as scary. 
It was a flying saucer, all right. It 
glowed with like a sort of pearly 
light that made you feel — 1 dunno 
how to say it, exactly — like, peace- 
ful. 

Q. Peaceful? 

A. Not only that. Good. It made 
me sorry I was such a rat. 

Q. Go on. 

A. Well, anyway, after a minute

a door opened with like a kind of 
a musical note. F sharp, I'd say. 
Harry, he thought it was F natural. 
Well, we got to fighting over that, 
and then we looked up and there 
were these three, uh, creatures. Ex- 
traterrestrials, like. They told us 
they had long watched the bicker- 
ings and like that of Earthmen and 
they had come to bring us wisdom 
and peace. They had this sealed 
book that would make us one wi f h 
the Higher Creation. So we took a 
couple — 

Q. They gave you each one? 

A. Oh, no. I mean, they didn’t 
give them to us. They sold them to 
us. Twenty-five bucks apiece. We 
paid them in topazes. 

Q. You each had to have a 
book? 

A. Well, they only work for one 
person, see? I mean, if it’s anybody 
else’s book you can't see it. You 
can’t even tell it’s there. 

Gull frowned. It would be sticky 
trying to learn much about the 
book if one couldn't see it. Still, 
even if the book itself were invis- 
ible, its effects were tangible in- 
deed — or so said the account on the 
tapes. Reik had described his ac- 
tions on entering Heliopolis: 

Harry he lemme his switchblade. 
I stuck it right through my cheeks, 
here. I didn’t bleed a drop, and then 
I kind of levitated myself, and af- 
ter a while I did the Indian Rope 
Trick, except since I just had my 
good necktie for a rope I couldn’t 
get far enough up to disappear. You 
have to get like seventy five per 



cent of your body height up before 
you disappear. 

Q. Could you disappear if you 
had a long enough rope? 

A. Hell, yes. Only I won’t. You 
get to a higher cycle of psychic 
Oneness like me and you don’t kid 
around with that stuff any more. 

Q. Did you do anything else? 

A. Well, not till after dinner. 
Then I put myself in a cataleptic 
trance and went to sleep. I didn’t 
do that any more after that, though. 
Catalepsy doesn’t really rest you. I 
was beat all the next day, but I 
figured, what the hell. I was still 
only on page seven. 

Gull sighed, relit his stogie and 
contemplated the shimmering per- 
fection of his nails. 

And at that moment his door- 
chime sounded. Through the open 
switch of the announcer -phone came 
a sound of terrified sobbing and 
the throaty, somehow familiar voice 
of a frightened girl: 

“Please! Open the door quickly, 
I 'ave to see you. I beg you to 
’urry, Meesta Gull!” 

G ull froze. He realized at once 
that something was amiss, for 
the name on his travel documents 
was not Gull. Steadily he consid- 
ered the implications of that fact. 
Someone knew his real identity . 
Gull called, “One moment.” He 
was stalling for time, while his mind 
raced to cope with the problems 
that deduction entailed, if his iden- 
tity were known, then security had 
been breached. If security were 
breached, then his mission was com- 



13 



IF 




promised. If his mission were com- 
promised — 4 

Gull grinned tightly, careless of 
the possible camera-eye that would 
even now be recording his every 
move. If his mission were compro- 
mised the only intelligent, safe, ap- 
proved procedure would be to re- 
turn to Marsport and give it up. 
And that, of course, was wbat Jo- 
han Gull would never do. 

Carefully, quickly, he slid into his 
socks and slippers, blew on his nails 
to make sure they were dry and 
threw open the door, one hand close 
to the quick-draw pocket in his 
lounging robe where his gun awaited 
his need. 

“Thank God,” whispered the girl 
at the doorway. She was lovely. A 
slim young blonde. Blue eyes, in 
which a hint of recent tears stained 
the eyeshadow at the corners. 

Courteously Gull bowed. “Come 
in,” he said, closing the door behind 
her. “Sit down, if you will. Would 
you care for coffee? A drop of 
brandy? An ice cream?” 

She shook her head and cried: 
“Meesta Gull, your life is in ’ideous 
danger!” 

Gull stroked his goatee, his smile 
friendly and unconcerned. “Oh, 
come off it, my dear,” he said. 
“You expect me to believe that!” 
And yet, he mused, she was really 
beautiful, no more than twenty- 
seven, no taller than five feet three. 

And the tiny ridge at the hem- 
line of her bodice showed that she 
carried a flame pencil. 

“You must believe me! I *ave 
taken a frightful chance to come 
’ere!” 



“Oh, yes, no doubt,” he shrugged, 
gazing at her narrowly. It was her 
beauty that had struck him at first, 
but there were more urgent consid- 
erations about this girl than her 
charms. For one thing, what was 
that she carried? A huge bag, per- 
haps; it almost seemed large enough 
to be a suitcase. For anpther — 
Gull’s brows came together. There 
was something about her that 
touched a chord in his memory. 
Somewhere . sometime ... he 
had seen that girl before. “Why Jo 
you come here with this fantastic 
story?” he demanded. 

The girl began to weep. Great 
soft tears streamed down her face 
like summer raindrops on a pane. 
But she made no sound and her 
eyes were steady on his. “Meesta 
Gull,” she said simply, “I come ere 
to save your life because 1 must. 
I love you.” 

“Hah!” 

“But it is true,” she insisted. “1 
love you more than life itself, 
Meesta Gull. More than my soul 
or my ’opes of ’Eaven. More even 
than my children — Kim, who is six; 
Marie Celeste, four; or little Patty.” 
She drew out a photograp.1 and 
handed it to him. It showed her in 
a plain knitted suit, with the three 
children grouped around a Christmas 
tree. 

Gull softened slightly. “Nice-look- 
ing kids,” he commented, returning 
the picture. 

“Thank you.” 

“No y really. I mean it.” 

“You’re being kind.” 

Gull started to reply, "hen stopped 
himself.

For he was falling into the oldest 
trap in the business. He was allowing 
his gentler emotions to interfere 
with the needs of the assignment. 
In this business there was no room 
for sentiment, Gull thought wryly. 
Better men than he had been taken 
in by the soft passions and bad paid 
for it, in death, in torture, in dis- 
memberment — worst of all, in the 
failure of a mission. “Hell with all 
that stuff,” he said gruffly. “I still 
can’t accept your story.” 

“You must! The Black ’Ats ave a 
plan to kill you!” 

He shook his head. “I can’t take 
a stranger’s word for it.” 

The tears had stopped. She gazed 
at him for a long, opaque moment. 
Then she smiled tantalizingiy. 

“A stranger, Meesta Gull?” 
“That’s what I said.” 

“I see.” She nodded gravely. “We 
’ave never met, eh? And therefore 
I could not possibly know some- 
thing about you — oh, something 
that perhaps is very private.” 

“What are you talking about? 
Get to the point!” 

“Something,” she continued, her 
eyes veiled but dancing with amuse- 
ment, “that perhaps you ’ave told 
no one else. A — shall we say — a 
sore lip, Meesta Gull? Received, 
perhaps, in an alley in the Syrian 
quarter of Marsport?” 

G ull was startled. “Really! Now, 
look. I — confound it, how 
could you possibly know about that? 
I’ve mentioned it to no one!” 

She inclined her head, a tender 
and mocking gesture. 

“But it’s true! And there was no 



one there at the time! Not a single 
living soul but myself and the wom- 
an who trapped me!” 

The girl pursed her lips but did 
not speak. Her eyes spoke for her. 
They were impudent, laughing at 
him. 

“Well, then!” he shouted. He was 
furious at himself. There had to be 
some rational explanation! Why had 
he let her catch him off-balance 
like this? It was a trick, of course. 
It could be no more than that. 
There were a thousand possible ex- 
planations of how she could have 
found out about it — “Well, then! 
How did you know?” 

“Meesta Gull,” she whispered 
soberly, “please trust me. I cannot 
tell you now. In precisely seven min- 
utes — ” she glanced at her watch — 
“an attempt will be made on vour 
life.” 

“Rot!” 

Her eyes flamed with sudden an- 
ger. “Idiot!” she blazed. “Oh, ’ow 
I ’ate your harrogance!” 

Gull shrugged with dignity. 
“Very well! Die, then, if you 
wish it. The Black ’Ats will kill you, 
but I will not die with you.” And 
she began to take off her clothes. 

Johan Gull stared. Then soberly, 
calmly he picked up his stogie, relit 
it and observed, “Your behavior is 
most inexplicable, my dear. ’ 
“Hah!” The girl stepped out of 
her dress, her lovely face bitter with 
anger and fear. A delicate scent of 
chypre improved the air. 

“This tactics will get you no- 
where,” said Gull. 

“Pah!” She touched the catch on 
her carrying case. It fell open and 



20 



IF 




a bright rubbery coverall fell out, 
with mask and stubby, bright tanks 
attached. 

“Good heavens!” cried Gull, 
startled. “Is that a warmsuit? 
SCUBA gear?” 

But the girl said only, “You ’ave 
four minutes left.” 

“You’re carrying this rather far, 
you know. Even if there are Black 
Hats aboard, we can’t leave the 
submarine underwater.” 

“Three minutes,” said the girl 
calmly, wriggling into her suit. But 
she was wrong. 

The submarine seemed to run into 
a brick wall in the water. 

They were thrown against the 
forward wall, a Laocoon of lovely 
bare limbs and rubbery warmsuit 
and Gull entwined in the middle. A 
huge dull sound blossomed around 
them. Gull fought himself free. 

The girl sat up, her face a mask 
of terror. “Oh, damn the damn 
thing,” she cried, shaking her wrist, 
staring at her watch. “I must’ve for- 
got to set it. Too late, Meesta Gull! 
We ’ave been torpedoed!” 

IV 

T he warbling wheep-wheep of 
alarm signals blended with a 
confused shouting from the steer- 
age holds below. The cabin lighting 
flickered, went out, tried once more, 
failed and was replaced by the pur- 
plish argon glow of the standby 
system. A racking, shuddering crash 
announced the destruction of the 
nuclear reactor that fed the hydro- 
jets; somewhere, water was pouring 
in. 



“’Urry, Meesta Gull!” cried the 
girl. 

“Of course,” said Gull, courteous- 
ly assisting her with the warmsuit. 
He patted her shoulder. “Not to 
worry, my dear. I owe you an apol- 
ogy, I expect. At a more propitious 
time — ” 

“Meesta Gull! The bulkheads ’ave 
been sabotaged!” 

Gull smiled confidently and turn- 
ed to his escape procedures. Now 
that it was a matter of instant action 
he was all right. His momentary 
uncertainty was behind him. 

Coolly he reached into his pocket, 
unsnapped the little packet of micro- 
thin Standing Orders and scanned 
their titles. “Let me see, now. 
Checklist for air evacuation — no. 
Checklist for enemy attack, artillery. 
Checklist for enemy attack, ICBM. 
Checklist for — ” 

“Meesta Gull,” she cried, with 
real fear in her voice. “’Ave you 
forgotten that these waters are the 
’abitat of the Martian piranha? You 
must ’urry!” 

“Well, what the devil do you 
think I’m doing? Now be still; I 
have it here.” And crossly Gull be- 
gan to check off the items under 
Submarine torpedoing , Martian can* 
als : Secret papers, maps, halazone 
tablets, passports, poison capsule, 
toothbrush, American Express card 
. with metronome precision he 
stowed them away and nstantly 
donned his own SCUBA sear. 
“That’s the lot,” he announced, 
glancing distastefully at d-e d rtv

under the door. “We might as well 
be off, then.” He lowered ’he

SCUBA mask over his face — and 
raised it again at once, to fish out 
a packet of Kleenex in its water- 
proof packet and add it to his stores. 
“Sorry. Always get a sniffly nose 
when I’m torpedoed,” he apologiz- 
ed, and flung open the door to the 
passageway. 

A three-foot wall of water broke 
into the cabin, bearing with it a 
short - circuited purser - robot that 
hummed and crackled and twitched 
helplessly in a shower of golden 
sparks. “Outside, quick!” cried Gull, 
and led the way through the roiled, 
tumbling waters. 

The brave old T Coronae Borealis 
had taken a mortal wound. Half 
wading, half swimming, they fought 
strongly against the fierce drive of 
inwelling waters toward an escape 
hatch. In the dim purple gleam of 
the standby circuits they could see 
little. But they could hear much — 
shouts, distant screams, the horrid 
sounds of a great ship breaking up. 

There was nothing they could do. 
They were lucky to be able to escape 
themselves. 

And then it was nothing; a few 
strong strokes upward, a minute 
of clawing through the gelid, fungal 
mass that prevented the canals’ 
evaporation and had concealed their 
water from Earthly telescopes for 
a hundred years — and they were 
safe. Armed and armored in their 
SCUBA gear, they had no trouble 
with the piranhas. 

Gull and the girl dragged them- 
selves out on the bank of the sludgy 
canal and stared back at the waters, 
gasping for breath. There were omi- 
nous silent ripples and whorls. They 



watched for long minutes. But no 
other head appeared to break the 
surface. 

Gull’s face was set in a mask of 
anger. “Poor devils,” he allowed 
himself, no more. 

But in his heart he was resolved. 
A hundred men, women and robots 
had perished in the torpedoing of 
the T Coronae. Someone would pay 
for it. 

A cross the burning ochre sands 
they marched . then trudged 
. then stumbled. The pitiless sun 
poured down on them. 

“Meesta Gull,” sobbed the girl. “It 
is ’ot.” 

“Courage,” he said absently, con- 
centrating on making one foot move, 
and then the other. They had many 
miles to go. Gull’s maps had indi- 
cated a nearly direct route from the 
canal along the Sinus Sabaeus where 
the submarine was slowly beginning 
to rust, straight across the great hot 
sweep of Syrtis Major to Heliopolis. 
A direct route. But it was not an 
easy one. 

Step, and step. Gull thought sar- 
donically of the two prospectors who 
had come out of this desert to start 
all the trouble. When they entered 
Heliopolis it had been on a magic 
carpet that slid through Mars’s thin 
air like a knife. Nice to have one 
now, he thought — though exhaus- 
tive tests had shown the carpet itself 
to be a discontinued Sears, Roebuck 
model from the looms of Grand 
Rapids. But somehow they had made 
it work — 

He sighed and called a halt. The 
girl fell exhausted to the sands.

“Meesta Gull,” she whispered, “I 
cannot go much farther.'* 

“You must,” he said simply. He 
fell to studying his maps, checking 
the line ot sight to the distant hill- 
ocks that passed, on Mars, for 
mountains. “Right on,” he murmur- 
ed with satisfaction. “See here. Sev- 
en more miles west and we’re in 
the Split Cliffs. Then bear left, 
and — ” 

“You are not ’uman! I must ’ave 
rest — water!” 

Gull only shrugged. “Can’t be 
helped, my dear. But at least the 
sun will be behind us, now. We can 
do it.” 

“No, no!” 

“Yes,” said Gull sharply. “Good 
God. woman! Do you want to be 
caught out here after dark?” He 
sneezed. “Excuse me,” he said, 
fumbling a Kleenex out of the 
packet and wiping his nose. 

“Five minutes,” she begged. 

Johan Gull looked at her thought- 
fully, dabbing at his nose. He had 
not solved the mystery she present- 
ed. There was every reason to be 
on guard. Yet she had truly warned 
him of the torpedoing of the sub- 
marine, and surely she could be no 
threat to him out here, as piteously 
weakened as she was. He replaced 
his breathing guard and dropped 
the Kleenex to the ground. A mo- 
ment later the empty pack followed. 
It had been the last. 

But Gull merely scuffed sand over 
it with his foot and said nothing; 
no sense adding to her worries. He 
said chivalrously, “Oh, all right. And 
by the way, what’s your name?” 

She summoned up enough reserves 



of strength to smile coquettishly. 
“Alessandra,” she murmured. 

Gull grinned and nudged her with 
his elbow. “Under the circum- 
stances,” he chuckled, “I think VJk 
call you Sandy, eh?” 

“Don’t jest, Meesta Gull! Even if 
we survive this trip, you ’ave still 
the Black ’Ats to face in “Eliopolis.” 

“I’ve faced them before, my dear. 
Not to worry.” 

“ Ave you seen what they can do 
now? With their creatures from out- 
er space?” 

“Well, now. But I’ll think of 
something.” 

She looked at him for a long and 
thoughtful minute. Then she said, 
“I know you will, Meesta Gull. It is 
love that tells me so.” 

V 

S tep, and step. In Mars’s easy 
grasp a man can lift much, 
jump high. But to slog through des- 
ert sands is little easier than on 
Earth; the sliding grains underfoot 
rob him of strength and clutch at 
his stride. They were near exhaus- 
tion, Gull knew with clarity; and for 
the past half mile the girl had been 
calling to him. 

Gull closed his ears to her. He 
kept his eyes on his own lengthen- 
ing shadow before him, even when 
he heard her sobbing. They had no 
strength to spare for conversation. 

“Meesta Gull,” she whispered 
brokenly. “Wait, please.” 

He kept on grimly, head down, 
feet moving like pendulums. 

“Meesta Gull! But I must ask 
you something.”

IF 




Over his shoulder he murmured, 
“No time for that, old girl. Keep 
walking.” 

“But I *ave to know.” 

“Oh, for God’s sake,” he said, 
and waited for her to catch up. 
“What is it now?” 

“Only this, Meesta Gull. If we 
are ’eading west, why is the sun be- 
hind us?” 

“Really, Sandy! I swear you have 
no consideration at all!” 

“I am most sorry, Meesta Gull. I 
only asked.” 

“You only asked,” he repeated 
bitterly. “You only asked! And now 
you know what I have to do? I 
have to stop and take out the maps 
and waste all kinds of time just to 
satisfy your damned curiosity. Of 
course we’re heading west!” 

“I really am very sorry.” 

“And the reason the sun’s behind 
us — Well, if you knew geometry — 
Look here. I’ll show you on the 
map.” 

She fell to the ground again as 
he pored over the charts, frowning 
at the horizon, returning to his grid 
lines. At length his expression 
cleared. 

“I thought so,” he said trium- 
phantly. “Perfectly simple, my dear. 
Up you get.” 

With rough tenderness he helped 
her to her feet and set off again, 
smiling. She did not speak at first, 
but presently she ventured: “Meesta 
Gull, we are ’eading toward the sun 
now. And these seem to be our own 
footprints we are retracing.” 

Gull patted her good-humoredly. 
“Don’t worry, Sandy.” 

“But, Meesta Gull— 1 ” 



“Will, you for God’s sake shut 
up?” Confounded women, thought 
Gull. How they did go on! And ho 
might have said something harsh to 
the poor girl, except that that oo* 
curred which drove all thoughts of 
compass headings from both their 
minds. 

There was a terrible thunder of 
many hooves. 

Alessandra whimpered and clutch- 
ed his arm. Gull stopped short, 
waiting; and over a rise in the ochre 
sands came a monstrous gray-green 
creature with six legs. It was huge 
as an elephant and its look was 
deadly; and it bore a rider, a huge, 
manlike, green-skinned creature with 
four arms, holding a murderous- 
looking lance. 

The thoat, for such it was, skid- 
ded to a stop before them. Its mon- 
strous rider dismounted with a single 
leap. 

For an endless second the crea- 
ture glared at them through nar- 
rowed, crimson eyes. Then it 
laughed with a sound of harsh and 
distant thunder. 

“Ho!” it cried, tossing the lance 
away. “I won’t need this for such 
as you! Prepare to defend yourself, 
Earthling — and know that you face 
the mightiest warrior of the dead 
sea bottoms, Tars Tarkas of Thark!” 

T he girl cried out in terror. Johan 
Gull gripped her shoulder, try- 
ing to will strength and courage in- 
to her. 

It was damnably bad luck, he 
thought, that they should some- 
how have taken the wrong turn. 
Clearly they had blundered into pri- 



UNDER TWO MOONS 



25 




v&te property . and he had a 
rather good idea of just whose prop- 
erty they had blundered into. 

He stepped forward and said, 
“Wait! I believe I can settle this to 
everybody’s satisfaction. It’s true 
that we don’t have tickets, Tars 
Tarkas, but you see we were tor- 
pedoed in the Sinus Sabaeus and 
had no opportunity to pass the us- 
ual admission gate.” 

“Wretched Earthling!” roared the 
monster. “If I issue you tickets 
there is a ten per cent surcharge; 
I don’t make Barsoomland policy, I 
only work here. What say you to 
that?” 

“Done!” cried Gull, and amend- 
ed it swiftly. “Provided you’ll ac- 
cept my American Express card — 
otherwise, you see, I have the devil 
of a time with the old expense ac- 
count.” 

The creature bared yellow fangs 
in a great, silent laugh. But it in- 
terposed no objection, and the card 
was quickly validated by compari- 
son with the Barsoomian’s built-in 
magnetic file. Tars Tarkas nodded 
his enormous head, swiftly wrote 
them out two lavender slips and 
roared: “Here you are, sir. If you 
wish to exchange them for regular 
family-plan tickets at the gate there 
will be a small refund ... I am 
assuming the la'dy is your wife,” he 
twinkled. “And now, welcome to 
Barsoomland. Be sure to visit the 
Giant Sky Ride from the Twin 
Towers of Helium, in the base of 
which are several excellent restau- 
rants where delicious sandwiches 
and beverages may be obtained at 
reasonable prices. Farewell!” 

2S 



“I think not,” said Gull at once. 
“Don’t go. We need transportation.” 
“By the hour or contract price?” 
parried the Martian. 

“Direct to Heliopolis. And no 
tricks,” warned Gull. “I’ve taken 
this ride fifty times. I know what 
the meter should show.” 

Muttering to himself, the creature 
leaped up on his throat and allowed 
them to clamber behind. And they 
were off. 

T he motion of the thoat was vag- 
uely disconcerting to the sense 
of balance, like a well trained camel 
or a very clumsy horse. But it ate 
up the miles. And for a nominal 
fee Tars Tarkas consented to supply 
them with food and drink. 

Gull ate quickly, glanced at the 
girl to make sure she was all right — 
which she was, though a trifle green 
and apparently not greatly interest- 
ed in food — and set to work to 
question the Thark. “You’ve had 
some interesting goings-on,” he 
yelled up toward the enormous head. 

“It is even so, Earthling,” tolled 
Tars Tarkas’s great voice. 

“Flying saucers and that sort of 
thing.” 

The bright red eyes regarded him. 
“Evil things!” roared the Thark 
somberly. “May Iss bear them 
away!” 

“Oh, I certainly hope that too,” 
agreed Gull. He was hanging on to 
the Barsoomian’s back, his face 
at about the level of the creature’s 
lower left-hand armpit, and carry- 
ing on a conversation presented dif- 
ficulties. But he persevered. “Have 
you seen any of it yourself?” he 



IF 




asked. “Psionics or any of that? 
UFOs? Little green monsters?” 

“ Watch your mouth!” cried the 
Barsoomian, enraged. 

“No, no. Little green monsters. 
Nothing personal.” 

The Thark glared at him with 
suspicion and hostility for a mo- 
ment. Then the huge, reptilian face 
relaxed. The Thark muttered. “Not 
bow. When we get to Heliopolis, go 
to the — ” 

The voice broke off. Tars Tarkas 
eocked a pointed ear, and stared 
about. 

With a whirring, whining sound, 
something appeared over the dunes. 
The girl cried out and clutched at 
Gull, who had little comfort to give 
her. Whatever it was, it was not of 
this planet — or of any other that 
Johan Gull had ever seen. It had 
the shape of a flying saucer. It 
glittered in the blood-red, lowering 
sun, arrowing straight toward them. 
As it drew near they could see the 
markings on its stern: 

U.F.Q. Cumrovin 2nd 
Giant Rock, Earth 

“Blood of Issus!” shouted f the 
Barsoomian. “It’s one of them\” 

Tars Tarkas bellowed animal ha- 
tred to the dark Martian sky and 
raised his lance. Fierce white fires 
leaped from its tip — struck the alien 
vessel, clung and dropped away. 
The craft was unharmed. 

It soared mockingly, tantalizing- 
ly overhead for a moment, seeming 
to dare them to fire on it again. 
Then a single needle of ruby light 
darted out of its side, reached down 



and touched Tars Tarkas between 
his bright red eyes. 

The Barsoomian seemed to ex- 
plode. 

The concussion flung them from 
the throat. Dazed, stunned, aching 
in every bone, Johan Gull managed 
to drag himself to his feet and look 
around. 

The alien spacecraft was gone. 
The girl lay stunned and half-un- 
conscious at his feet. Yards away 
Tars Tarkas was a giant mound of 
gray-green flesh and bright metal 
parts, writhing faintly. 

Gull staggered over to the crea- 
ture and craddled the ravaged head 
in his lap. 

The scarlet eyes stared sightlessly 
into his. The ruin of a mouth open- 
ed. 

“We ... are property,” whispered 
Tars Tarkas thickly, and died. 

VI 

O nce, when Johan Gull was very 
young, the newest and least 
reliable of cogs in Security’s great 
machine, he had been assigned to 
Heliopolis to counter a Black Hat 
ploy. Or not quite that, he admitted; 
he had been sent to add a quite un- 
important bit of information to the 
already huge store that the agent 
operating on the scene already had. 
He had envied that agent, had 
young Johan Gull. He had looked 
with jealous eyes about the bright, 
dizzying scenes of Heliopolis and 
dreamed of a time when he too 
might be a senior agent in charge, 
himself a major piece in the Game, 
squiring a lovely lady on an errand 



UNDER TWO MOONS

of great consequence, in the teeth 
of dreadful danger. 

All the fun of it was in the an- 
ticipation, he thought as they rode 
into Heliopolis lock on their bat- 
tered thoat, checked it at the Avis 
office and dismounted. If only Tars 
Tarkas had survived to tell what he 
knew! 

But he had not; and Gull was un- 
easily aware that he knew no more 
now than when he left Marsport. 
Still, he thought, brightening, this 
was Heliopolis, the Saigon of Syrtis 
Major. He might get killed. He 
might not be able to protect this 
lovely and loving girl from mis- 
chance. He might even fail in his 
mission. But he was bound to have 
a hell of a time. 

They found rooms at the Grand 
and parted to freshen up. Overhead 
the city’s advertising display flashed 
on the thin, yellowish clouds of 
Mars, on, off — on, off: 

HELIOPOLIS 

The Wickedest City in the Worlds 
Liquor * Gambling * Vice 
The Family That Plays Together 
Stays Together 

And indeed, Gull saw, the pleas- 
ure-seekers who thronged the con- 
courses and the lobby of the Grand 
had often enough brought the kid- 
dies. He watched them sentimental- 
ly as the bellthing trundled his lug- 
gage toward the elevators. It would 
be most pleasant to spend a holi- 
day here, he thought, with someone 
you loved. With Alessandra, per- 
haps. Perhaps even with Kim, Marie 
Celeste and little Patty . 



But he could not afford thoughts 
like that; and he quickly showered, 
shaved, put on a clean white suit 
and met the girl in the great gleam- 
ing cocktail lounge of the Grand. 

“’Elio, Meesta Gull,” she said 
softly, her eyes dark and somehow 
laughing. 

Gull regarded her thoughtfully. 
She was sight worth regarding, for 
the girl in the cocktail lounge was 
nothing like the bedraggled, terri- 
fied creature in the ochre sands. Her 
green-blue eyes were smoky with 
mystery. Her leongsam, deeply slit, 
revealed the gleam of a bronzed 
rounded thigh. A whisper of some 
provocative scent caressed him; bat 
it was not her charms that had him 
bemused; it was something else. His 
eyes narrowed. Somewhere, he 
thought. Some time . 

She laughed. “You are thought- 
ful,” she said. “Will you ’ave a 
drink with me?” 

“The pleasure is all mine,” he said 
gallantly. 

“Unless you have other plans?” 
she inquired. There was no doubt 
about it; she was poking fun at 
him. 

He rose to her mood. “It’s the 
least I could do, my dear — seeing 
you saved my life.” 

“Ah! Life.” She glanced wryly at 
him from the corner of her eye. 
“What is it, this ‘life’ I ’ave saved? 
Can one taste it? Can one carry it 
to bed?” 

Gull grinned. “Perhaps not, but 
I’m rather attached to mine.” He 
ordered drinks, watched carefully 
while they were made, then nodded 
and raised his glass. “Of course,” he 



28 



IF 




added, “I’ve saved your life too — 
I guess, let’s see — oh, perhaps three 
times. From Tars Tarkas. From dy- 
ing by thirst. From the saucer 
people. So you actually owe me 
about three to one, lifesaving-wise.” 
“Three to two, dear Meesta Gull,” 
the girl whispered over the rim of 
her glass. 

“Two? Oh, I think not. Just the 
torpedoing, really, and as a matter 
of fact I’m not sure you should get 
full credit for that. You were a 
little tardy there.” 

She shook her head. “Yes, the 
torpedoing — and something else. 
’Ave you forgotten? The old ware- 
house? The — incident — which 
caused your sore lip?” 

Gull stared at her, then brought 
his glass down with a crash. “Got 
it!” he shouted. “I remember now! 
. Oh, damn it, sorry,” he went 
on, shaking his head. “It was on the 
tip of my tongue, but I’ve lost it. 
Sorry.” 

He stared at her moodily 
and drained his glass. “No matter. 
I’ll think of it. I promise you that.” 

T he girl laughed softly, then sob- 
ered. “Meanwhile,” she said, 
“we ’ave some more important busi- 
ness ’ere.” And she nodded toward 
the great crystal pane that opened 
on the thronged boulevards of Hel- 
iopolis. 

Gull followed the direction of her 
glance and saw at once what she 
meant. A demonstration was in 
progress. A hundred straggling, 
shouting marchers were carrying 
placards with as many harsh and 
doctrinaire slogans: 



Let the Space People Save You! 

We Are Property 

Why Is the Air Force Covering 
Up Sightings? 

Gull said abruptly, “Let’s take a 
look.” 

The girl rose without answering 
and together they walked out to 
the terrace. The shouts of the dem- 
onstrators smote them like a fist. 
Gull could barely distinguish the 
cadenced words in the roar of 
sound: “Make . Mars . the 
tomb of skepticism ” over and over 
in time to their march until it 
changed to “Welcome UFOs now ! 
Welcome UFOs nowl” 

“They take it seriously,” he mur- 
mured. Alessandra did not answer; 
he glanced at her, then followed 
the direction of her gaze. A man in 
stained coveralls, eyes fixed on them, 
was pushing his way in their direc- 
tion through the crowd. He was tall, 
and not young. His face was lined 
with the ineradicable burn of a life 
spent on the Martian desert. 

Gull stroked his goatee to hide a 
thrill of excitement that tingled 
through him. This could be it: The 
break he was looking for. 

The man stopped just below 
them, looking up. “Hey, you!” he 
bawled. “You Gull?” 

Gull shouted carefully, “That’s 
my name, yes.” 

“Well, where the devil you been? 
We been waiting for you!” cried the 
man in irritable tones. He reached 
up, clutched at a carved projection 
on the face of the terrace, raised 
himself and swung to face the 
crowd. “Hey, everybody!” he shout-

ed. “K ' the fella that thinks 
UFOs lkc phony! This way! You! 
Look here!” 

Heads were beginning to turn. The 
ragged line of marchers slowed, 
Gull whispered to the girl, whose 
presence he could feel shivering be- 
side him: “Careful! I don’t know 
what he’s going to do. If it looks 
like trouble — run!” 

But he could not hear her an- 
swer, if she made one, for the man 
was turning back to him again. In 
the diminished sound of the street 
his raucous yell sounded clearly: 
“All right, Gull! You think our 
supranormal powers’re all a lotta 
crud, see what you think of this!” 
And he made a snatching motion at 
what, as far as Gull could see, was 
empty air; caught something, 
squeezed it in his fist; turned toward 
Gull and threw it. 

There was nothing in the man’s 
hand. 

But that nothing spun toward 
Gull like a pinwheeling comet, huge 
and bright and deadly; it hummed 
and sang shrilly of hate and destruc- 
tion; it rocketed up toward him like 
an onrushing engine of destruction. 
And something in it sapped his will. 
He stood frozen, impotent to move. 

Vaguely he felt a stir of motion 
beside him. Hazily he knew that the 
girl was thrusting at him, shouting 
at him, hurling him aside. Too late! 
The hurtling doom came up and 
struck him — just a corner brushing 
against his head as he fell — but 
enough; worlds crashed; hell-bombs 
roared in his skull; he dropped, 
away and away, endlessly down into 
. into ... he could not see, 



could not guess what it was; but it 
was filled with terror and pain and 
doom. 

But then he was awake again, and 
the girl was weeping over him; he 
could feel her teardrops splashing 
on his face. 

G ull coughed, gasped, clutched at 
his pounding skull and pushed 
himself erect. “What — What — ” 
“Oh, thank ’eaven! I was afraid 
’Arry ’ad killed you!” 

“Apparently not,” he said dizzily; 
and then, “Harry who? How do you 
know who that fellow was?” 
“What does it matter?” she cried. 
Bright tears hung unshed in her 
eyes. 

“Well, it kind of matters to me,” 
said Gull doubtfully, looking around. 
They were no longer on the terrace. 
Somehow she had lugged him back 
into the greater security of the 
cocktail lounge. A waiter was hang- 
ing over them, whirring in a worried 
key. 

“Harry Rosencranz!” he cried 
suddenly. The girl nodded. “Sure! 
And he knew I was coming. Well, 
that tears it. My cover’s blown for 
sure.” He glared at the waiter and 
said, “Don’t just stand there. Bring 
us a drink.” The thing went away, 
warbling unhappily to itself. It had 
not been programmed for this sort 
of thing. 

Indeed Gull needed a drink. The 
reality of supranormal powers was 
a phenomenon of a totally differ- 
ent kind than the contemplation of 
them at a distance. The tapes about 
Reik and his partner had been inter- 
esting; the reality was terrifying.

He seized the glass as soon as of- 
fered and drained it; and then he 
turned to Alcs-andra. “You’ve got 
some explaining to do,” he said. 

The tears were very near the 
surface now. 

She waited. 

“How did you know it was Ros- 
encranz?” he demanded. “And the 
torpedoing — you knew about that. 
And don’t think I’ve forgotten that 
we’ve met before . somewhere 
. don’t worry, I’ll think of where 
it was.” 

She inclined her head, hiding her 
face. 

“You’re working for someone, 
aren’t you?” Her silence was an- 
swer enough. “A nice girl like you! 
How’d you get into this?” He shook 
his head, mystified. 

“Ah, Meesta Gull,” she said 
brokenly, “it’s the old, old story. 
My ’usband — dead. My little ones 
— ’ungry. And what could I do? 
And now they ’ave me in their 
power.” 

“Who?” 

“The Black ’Ats, Meesta Gull. 
Yes, it is true. I am in the employ 
of your enemy.” 

“But damn it, girl! I mean, you 
said you loved me!” 

“I do! Truly! Oh, ’ow I do!” 

“Now, wait a minute. You can’t 
love me and work for them ” object- 
ed Gull. 

“I can too! I do!” 

“Prove it.” 

She flared, “’Appily! ’Ow?” 

Gull signaled for another drink. 
He smiled at the girl quite fondly. 
“It’s very simple,” he said. “Just 
take me to your leader.” 



I t took a bit of doing, but the 
girl did it. She returned from a 
series of cryptic telephone conversa- 
tions and looked at Gull with great, 
fearful eyes. “I ’ave arranged it,” 
she said somberly. “You will be al- 
lowed in. But to get out again — ” 
Gull laughed and patted' her hand. 
He was not worried. 

Still, he admitted to himself a 
little later, things could get a bit dif- 
ficult. Security precautions for the 
Black Hats were in no way less 
stringent than those of Gull’s own 
headquarters in Marsport. He allow- 
ed himself to be seated in a reclining 
chair while a gnomelike old dentist 
drilled a totally unneeded filling 
into a previously healthy tooth; and 
when he rose, the exit through 
which he left the office brought 
him to a long, dark tunnel under- 
ground. 

The girl was waiting there silently 
to conduct him to his destination. 
She placed a finger across her lips 
and led him away. “Wait a minute,” 
Gull whispered fiercely, looking 
about. For there were interesting 
things here. Off the corridor were 
smaller chambers and secondary tun- 
nels filled with all sorts of objects 
shadowy and objects small. Gull 
wanted very much to get a look at 
them. Those tiny disjointed doll- 
shapes! what were they? And the 
great gleaming disk section beyond? 

But the girl was pleading, and 
Gull allowed himself to be led away. 

She conducted him to a door. 
“Be careful,” she whispered. And 
she was gone, and Gull was face

to face with the chief of the Black 
Hats in Heliopolis. 

He was a tall, saturnine man. He 
sat at a desk that reflected gold 
and green lights into his face, from 
signals that Gull could not see. 
“Oodgay eveningway, ” he said ur- 
banely. “Ah, I see you are perplex- 
ed. Perhaps you do not speak Solex 
Mai.” 

“Afraid not. English, French, Cre- 
tan Linear B, Old Ganymedan’s 
about the lot.” 

“No matter. I am familiar with 
your tongue as we speak it all the 
time on Clarion.” He leaned forward 
suddenly. Gull stiffened; but it was 
only to hand him a calling card. 
It glittered with evil silver fires, and 
it read: 

T. Perlman 
Clarion 

“Clarion’s a planet? I never heard 
of it.” 

Perlman shrugged. Obviously what 
Gull had heard of did not matter. 
He said, “You are a troublemaker, 
Mr. Gull. We space people do not 
tolerate troublemakers for long.” 

“As to that,” said Gull, stroking 
his goatee, “it seems to me you had 
a couple of shots at doing something 
about it. And Pm still here.” 

“Oh, no, Mr. Gull,” said Perlman 
earnestly. “Those were only warn- 
ings. .. Their purpose was only to 
point out to you that it is not ad- 
visable to cause us any trouble. You 
have not as yet done so. of course. 
If you do — ” He smiled. 

“You don’t scare me.” 

“No, Mr. Gull?” 



“Well, I mean, not much any- 
way. I’ve been lots more scared 
than this.” 

“How interesting,” Perlman said 
politely. 

“And anyway, I have my job to 
do and I’m going to do it.” 

Perlman pursed his lips and whis- 
pered into a microphone on his desk. 
There was a stirring of draperies at 
the back of the room. It was shad- 
owed there; Gull could see no de- 
tails. 

But he had a moment’s impres- 
sion of a face looking out at him, 
a great, sad, mindless long face with 
teeth like a horse and an air of in- 
finite menace; and then it was gone. 
He cried, “You’re up to some 
trick!” 

Perlman smirked knowingly. 

“It won’t do you any good! You 
think you know so much.” 

“Ah, if only I did, Mr. Gull! 
There are forces in this universe 
which even we of Clarion have not 
yet understood. The straight-line 
mystery, to name one. The Father’s 
plan.” 

Gull took a deep breath and care- 
fully, inconspicuously, released it. 
He was doing no good here. And 
meanwhile there were matters just 
outside this room that urgently re- 
quired investigation — and attention. 
He said steadily, “I’m going to go 
now, Mr. Perlman. If you try to 
stop me I’ll shoot you.” 

Perlman looked at him with an 
expression that suspended judgment 
for a moment. Then it came to a 
conclusion and broke into a shout 
of laughter. “Ho!” he choked. “Hah! 
Oh, Mr. Gull, how delicious to think

you will be allowed to leave. As we 
say in Solex Mai, otway ustcray!” 
Gull did not answer. He merely 
moved slightly, and into his hand 
leaped the concealed 3.15-picometer 
heat gun. 

Perlman’s expression changed from 
fire to ice. 

“I’ll leave you now,” said Gull. 
“Next time you have a visitor, 
search his goatee too, won’t you?” 
Ice were Perlman’s eyes. Icy was 
the stare that followed Gull out the 
door. 

B ut he was not safe yet, not while 
the horse-faced killer was pre- 
sumably lurking somewhere about. 
The girl appeared silently and put 
her hand in his. 

Gull gestured silence and strained 
his hearing. These tunnels were so 
dark; there were so many cul-de-sac* 
where an assassin could hide — 
“Listen,” he hissed. “Hear it? 
There!” 

From the shadows, distant but 
approaching, came the sound of an 
uneven step. Tap, clop. Tap, clop . 

The girl frowned. “A man with 
one leg?” she guessed. 

“No, no! Can’t you recognize it? 
It’s a normal man — but with one 
shoe hanging loose ” 

She caught her breath. “Oh!” 
“That’s right,” said Gull somber- 
ly, “the old. shoelace trick. And I 
haven’t time to deal with him now. 
Can you draw him off?” 

She said steadily, “If I ’ave to, I

can. 

“Good. Just give me five minutes. 
I want to look around and — effect 
some changes, I think.” He listened, 



the step was closer now. He whisp- 
ered, “Tall, long-faced man with big 
teeth. I think that’s him. Know 
him?” 

“Certainly, dear Meesta Gull. 
Clarence T. Reik. ’E’s a killer.” 

Gull grinned tautly; he had 
thought as much. The partner of 
Harry Rosencranz, of course; one 
had attacked him at the hotel, the 
other was stalking him with a sharp- 
ened shoelace in the warrens under 
the city. “Go along with you then,” 
he ordered. “There’s a good girl. Re- 
member, five minutes.” 

He felt the quick brush of ner 
lips against his cheek. “Give me ’alf 
a minute,” she said. “Then, dear 
Meesta Gull, run” 

And she sprang one way, he an- 
other. The approaching tap, clop 
paused a split-second’s hesitation. 

Then it was going after her, its 
tempo rapid now, its sound as dead- 
ly as the irritable rattle of a bask- 
ing snake. 

Gull had his five minutes. He 
only prayed that it had not been 
bought at a higher price than he 
wanted to pay. 

T here in the Black Hat warren* 
under Heliopolis Johan Gull ful- 
filled the trust .5 placed in him. He 
had only moments. Moments would 
be enough. For almost at once he 
knew. And he leaned against the 
nitered stone walls of the catacomb, 
marveling at the depth and daring 
of the Black Hat plan. Before him 
a chamber of headless, limbless man- 
nikins awaited programming and as- 
sembly. They were green and tiny. 
In another chamber six flying sau- 



34 



IF 




cers stood in proud array. Each of 
them held a ring of leather-cushion- 
ed seats. Behind him was a vast hall 
where signpainters had left their 
handiwork for the moment: Read 
the OAHSPE Bible , cried one sign; 
Five Minutes for $5. And another 
clamored, Welcome to UFO land. 

Gull nodded in unwilling tribute. 
The Black Hats had planned well . 

A sound of light, running foot- 
steps brought him back to reality. 
The pale shadow of the girl raced 
toward him. “Well done!” he whis- 
pered, urging her on. “Just one more 
time around and I’ll be through.” 

“It’s ’ot work, dear Meesta Gull,” 
she laughed; but she obeyed. He 
froze until she was out of sight, and 
the lumbering dark figure that fol- 
lowed her. And then he set to work. 

When she came by again he was 
ready. 

Quickly he leaped to the center 
of the corridor, gestured her to 
safety. She concealed herself in a 
doorway, panting, her eyes large but 
unafraid. And the pounding, deadly 
sound of her pursuer grew louder. 

Fourteen semester hours of ka- 
rate, a seminar in le savate and a 
pair of brass knuckles. All came 
to the aid of Johan Gull in that 
moment, and he had need of them. 
He propelled himself out of the 
shadows feet first, directly into the 
belly of the huge, long-faced man 
who was shambling down the dimly 
lit corridor. The man’s eyes were 
dull but his great yellowed teeth 
were bared in a grin as he moved 
ferally along the stone floor, a thin, 
lethal wand in one hand, dangerous, 
ready. 



Ready for a fleeing victim. Not 
ready for Johan Gull. 

For Gull came in under the dead- 
ly needle. Even as he was plung- 
ing into the man’s solar plexus he 
was reaching up with one hand, 
twisting around with the other. It 
was no contest. Gull broke the 
weapon-bearing arm between wrist 
and elbow, butted the man into par- 
alysis, kicked him in the skull as he 
fell, snatched the weapon and was 
away, the girl trailing behind him. 

“Hurry!” he called. “If he comes 
to, they’ll box us in here!” As he 
ran he worked one tip of the stiff- 
ened shoelace. Ingenious! Twisted 
one way, it slipped into limpness; 
twisted the other, it extended itself 
to become a deadly weapon. Gull 
chuckled and cast it away. Up the 
stairs they ran and through the cov- 
er dentist’s office. The gnomelike 
dentist squalled in surprise and ran 
at them with a carbide drill, hissing 
hatred; but Gull chopped him down 
with the flat of a hand. They were 
free. 

And the final battle was about to 
be fought. 

VIII 

*CX7"ou ’ave a plan, Meesta 
I Gull?” 

“Of course.” He glanced about 
warily. No Black Hats were in 
sight as he led her through :he 
bright, opulent doors of the Helio- 
polis Casino. 

“You are going to fight them 
single-’anded?” 

“Fight? My dear girl! Who said 
anything about fighting?” The chef

de chambre was bowing, smiling, 
welcoming them in. 

“But — But — But if you do not 
fight them, dear Meesta Gull, then 
*ow will you proceed?” 

Gull grinned tautly and led her 
to the bar, from which he could 
observe everything that was going 
on. He said only, “Money. No more 
questions now, there’s a good girl.” 
He called for wine and glanced 
warily about. The Casino was host 
that night, as it was every night, to 
a gay and glittering crowd. Behind 
potted lichens a string trio sawed 
away at Boccherini and Bach, while 
the wealthiest and most c ashionab*e 
of nine planets strolled and laughed 
and gamed away fortunes. Gull sip- 
ped his wine and stroked his goatee, 
his eyes alert. Now, if he had gaug- 
ed his man aright ... if he had 
assessed the strategy that would win 
correctly . 

It could all be very easy, he 
thought, pleased. And he could en- 
joy a very pleasant half hour’s en- 
tertainment into the bargain. 

Gull smiled and stroked the girl’s 
hand. She responded with a swift 
look of trust and love. In the glow- 
ing silky fabric of the dress he had 
commandeered for her she was a 
tasty morsel, he thought. Once this 
Black Hat ploy had been countered, 
there might be time for more light- 
hearted pursuits — 

“Attend!” she whispered sharply. 
Gull turned slowly. So near his 
elbow as to be almost touching stood 
the tall, saturnine figure of Perlman. 
They stood for a moment in a ten- 
sion of locked energies, eyes gazing 
into eyes. Then Perlman nodded 



urbanely and turned away. Gull 
heard him whisper to a passing 
houseman, “Atthay’s the erkjay.” 
Gull leaned to the girl. “I don’t 
speak Solex Mai,” he said softly. 
“You’ll have to translate for me.” 
She replied faithfully, “’E just 
identified you to the ’ouseman.” 
He gave her an imperceptible nod 
and followed Perlman with his eyes. 
The Black Hat did not look toward 
Gull again. Smiling, exchanging a 
word now and then with the other 
guests, he was moving' steadily to- 
ward the gaming tables. Gull allow- 
ed himself to draw one deep breath 
of satisfaction. 

Score one for his deduction! Perl- 
man was going to play. 

He nodded to the girl and began 
to drift toward the tables himself. 
Give it time, he counseled himself. 
There’s no hurry. Let it build. You 
were right this far, you’ll be right 
again. 

“Believe I’ll play a bit,” he said 
loudly. “Won’t you sit here and 
watch, my dear?” 

Silently the girl took a seat beside 
him at the table. Casually — but 
feeling, and relishing, the cold gam- 
bling tinge that spread upward from 
the pit in his stomach, inflaming his 
nerves, speeding the flow of his 
blood in his veins — Gull gestured 
to the croupier and began to play. 

He did not look across the table 
at the polite, assured face of Perl- 
man. He did not need to. This game 
had only two players — or only two 
that mattered. As he took the dice 
for his first turn, Gull reflected with 
comfort and satisfaction that soon 
there would be only one. 



36 



IF 




H alf an hour later he was all but 
broke. 

Across the table Perlman’s ex- 
pression had broadened from polite 
interest, through amusement to 
downright contempt. Gull’s own face 
wore a frown; his hands shook, an- 
gering him; he felt the first cold 
pricklings of fear. 

Confound the man, thought Gull, 
his luck is fantastic! If indeed it was 
luck. But no, he told himself angrily, 
he could not cop out so cozily; the 
tables were honest. Face truth: He 
had simply run up against a superb 
gambler. 

“Hell of a time for it to happen,” 
he grumbled. 

The girl leaned closer. “Pardon? 
You spoke?” 

“No, no,” Gull said irritably, “I 
— uh, was just thinking out loud. 
Listen. You got any money on you?” 
She said doubtfully, “Perhaps . 
a little bit . .” 

“Give it to me,” he demanded. 
“No! Under the table. I don’t want 
everybody to see.” But it was too 
late; across the table Perlman had 
not missed the little byplay. He was 
almost laughing openly now as he 
completed his turn and passed the 
dice to Gull. 

Gull felt himself breathing hard. 
He accepted the thin sheaf of bills 
from the girl, glanced at it quickly. 
Not much! Not much at all for what 
he had to do. He could stretch it 
out, make it last — but for how 
long? And with the game running 
against him . 

Silently Gull cursed and studied 
the table. Before him the wealth of 
an empire was piled in diamond 



chips and ruby, in pucks of glittering 
emerald and disks of glowing gold. 

Politely the croupier said, “It is 
your play, m’sieur.” 

“Sure, sure.” But still Gull hesi- 
tated. To gain time he tossed the 
girl’s wad down before the croupier 
and demanded it be exchanged for 
chips. 

Across the table Perlman’s look 
was no longer either amusement or 
contempt. It was triumph. 

Gull took a deep breath. This was 
more than a game, he reminded 
himself. It was the careful carrying 
out of a thoughtfully conceived stra- 
tegy. Had he lost sight of that? 

Once again in control of himself, 
he took out a cigarette and lighted 
it. He tipped the gleaming, flat 
lighter and glanced, as though bor- 
ed, at its polished side. 

Tiny in the reflection he could 
see the moving, bright figures in the 
room, the gorgeously dressed wom- 
en, the distinguished men. But some 
were not so distinguished. Some 
were lurking in the draperies, be- 
hind the potted lichens. A great 
pale creature with teeth like a horse, 
eyes like a dim-brained cat. An- 
other with the mahogany face of a 
prospector off the Martian plains. 
And others. 

Perlman’s men had come to join 
him. The moment was ready for 
the taking. 

Abruptly Johan Gull grinned. 
Risk it all! Win or lose! Let the 
game decide the victor — either he 
would clean out Perlman here and 
now, and starve out his larger game 
for lack of the cash to carry it 
through, or he himself would lose.

He said :he croupier, “Keep the 
chips. Take these too.” And he 
pushed over all his slim remaining 
stack. 

“You wish to build, m’sieur?” it 
asked politely. 

“Exactly. A hotel, if you please. 
On the — ” Gull hesitated, but not 
out of doubt; his pause was only to 
observe the effect on Perlman — 
“yes, that’s right. On the Board- 
walk.” 

nd Gull threw the dice. 

Time froze for him. It was 
not a frightening thing; he was calm, 
confident, at ease. The world of 
events and sensation seemed to offer 
itself to him for the tasting — the 
distant shout of the UFO demonstra- 
tors in the streets — poor fools / 7 
wonder what they'll do when they 
find they've been duped; Alessand- 
ra’s perfumed breath tickling his 
ear — sweet, charming girl; the look 
of threat and anger on Perlman’s 
face; the stir of ominous movement 
in the draperies. Gull absorbed and 
accepted all of it, the sounds and 
scents, the bright moving figures 
and the glitter of wealth and power, 
the hope of victory and the risks. 
But he did not fear the risks. He 
saw Ventnor Avenue and Marvin 
Gardens looming ahead of his piece 
on the board and smiled. He was 
certain the dice were with him. 

A.nd when the spots came up he 
seemed hardly to glance at them; 
he moved his counter with a steady 
hand, four, five, eight places; came 
to rest on “Chance”, selected a card 
from the stack, turned it over and 
scanned its message. 



He looked up into the hating eyes 
of Perlman. “Imagine,” he breathed. 
“I appear to have won second prize 
in a beauty contest. You’ll have to 
give me fifteen dollars.” 

And Perlman’s poise broke. Snarl- 
ing, he pushed across the chips, 
snatched the dice from Gull and 
contemptuously flung them down. 
The glittering cubes rattled and 
spun. Gull did not have to look at 
the board; the position was engrav- 
ed on his brain. A five would put 
Perlman on Park Place, with four 
houses: damaging, but not deadly. 
An eight or higher would carry him 
safely to “Go” and beyond, passing 
the zone of danger and replenishing 
his bankroll. But a seven . Ah, a 
seven! The Boardwalk, with a hotell 
And the first die had already come 
to rest, displaying a four. 

The second stopped. 

There was a gasp from the glit- 
tering crowd as three bright pips 
turned upward to the light. 

Gull glanced down at the dice, 
then across at Perlman. “How unfor- 
tunate,” he murmured politely, ex- 
tending a hand to Perlman — and 
only Perlman could see the bright, 
deadly little muzzle that pointed out 
of it toward him. “You seem to have 
landed on my property. I’m afraid 
you’ve lost the game.” 

— And he was up and out of his 
chair, standing clear, as the pencil 
of flame from the shelter of the 
draperies bit through the smoky air 
where his head had just been. 

“Down!” he shouted to the girl 
and snapped a shot at Rosencranz; 
heard that man’s bellow of pain and 
saw, out of the corner of his eye, 




38 



IF 




that the girl had disobeyed his order; 
she had drawn a weapon of her own 
and was trading shot for shot with 
the Black Hats that ringed the room. 
“Idiot!” Gull cried, but his heart 
exulted Good girl! even as he was 
turning to blast the next Black Hat. 
There were nine of them, all armed, 
all drawing their weapons or, like 
Rosencranz, having fired them al- 
ready. It was not an equal contest. 
Five shots from Gull, five from the 
girl — she missed one — and all the 
Black Hats were on the floor, writh- 
ing or very still. All but one. Perl- 
man! Whirling back to face him, 
Gull found he was gone. 

But he couldn’t be far. Gull 
caught the flicker of motion in the 
gaping crowd at the door that show- 
ed where he had gone, and followed. 
At the entrance Gull caught a 
glimpse of him and fired; at the 
corner, plunging through a knot of 
milling, excited UFOlogists, Gull 
saw him again — almost too 
late. Cooly and cleverly Perlman 
had waited him out, his own weapon 
drawn now. The blast sliced across 
the side of Gull’s head like a blow 
from a cleaver; stunned, hurting, 
Gull drove himself on. 

And as Perlman, gaping incredu- 
lously, turned belatedly to flee 
again, he tripped, and stumbled, and 
Gull was on him. His head was 
roaring, his hold on consciousness 
precarious; but he pinned Perlman’s 
arms in a desperate flurry of 
strength and panted, “That’s enough! 
Give it up or I’ll burn your head 
off.” The trapped man surged up 
but Gull withstood it and cried: 
“Stop! I want to take you back to .5 



alive — don’t make me kill you!” 
Ihe Black Hat spat one angry sen- 
tence; Gull gasped and recoiled; 
Perlman grabbed for the weapon, 
they struggled — 

A bright line of flame leaped 
from the gun to Perlman’s fore- 
head; and in that moment the lead- 
er of the Black Hats in Heliopolis 
ceased to be. 

Waves of blackness swept over 
Johan Gull. He fell back into empti- 
ness just as the girl came running 
up, dropped to the ground beside 
him, sobbing, “Johan! My dear, 
dear Meesta Gull;” 

Hurt and almost out he managed 
to grin up at her. “Cash in my 
chips for me,” he gasped. “We’ve 
won the game!” 

IX 

A nd then it was roses, roses all the 
way. The local Bureau Chief 
appeared and efficiently arranged 
for medical attention, fresh clothes 
and a drink. The girl stayed beside 
him while Gull dictated a report and 
demanded immediate reservations 
back to Marsport — for two, he spe- 
cified fiercely. They were produced, 
and by the time they disembarked 
and headed for the War Room Gull 
was nearly his old self. He was ad- 
mitted at once to ,5’s office, and 
recognized it as a mark of signal 
favor when the girl was allowed in 
with him. 

They stood there, proud and si- 
lent, in the presence of .5 and his 
secretary, and Gull’s hand was firm 
on the girl’s. What a thoroughbred 
she was, he thought admiringly, not-

ing from the corner of his eye how 
her gaze took in every feature of 
the room so few persons had ever 
seen; how she studied .5’s somber 
expression and hooded eyes, but aid 
not quail before them; how patiently 
and confidently she waited for Mc- 
Intyre to leave off writing in his 
notebook and speak to them. She 
would be a fit wife for him, thought 
Johan Gull with quiet certainty; and 
she would make a fine agent for 
Security. And so would Kim, and 
Marie Celeste, and little Patty. A 
very successful mission all around, 
thought Gull cheerfully, thinking of 
the wad of bills that Perlman’s losses 
had put into his wallet. 

“When you’re quite ready, Gull,” 
said McIntyre. 

Gull jumped. “Oh, sorry,” he said. 
“Excuse me, sir,” he added to .5, 
whose expression showed no parti- 
cular resentment at being kept wait- 
ing while one of his agents was wool- 
gathering, merely the usual patient 
weariness. “I guess you want a re- 
port.” 

“.5 has already seen your report,” 
McIntyre reproved him. “He is a 
little concerned about your failure 
to obey standing orders, of course. 
A live captive is worth a lot more 
than a dead loser.” 

“Well, yes, I know that’s right. 
But — ” Gull hesitated. 

“Well?” 

Gull flushed and turned to .5 
himself. “You see, sir, it was some- 
thing Perlman said. Nasty sort of 
remark. Cheap. Just what you’d ex- 
pect, from — Anyway, sir, it was 
about you. He said — ” Gull swal- 
lowed, feeling self-conscious and 



stupid. The warm pressure of the 
girl’s hand showed him her sym- 
pathy, but he still felt like twelve 
kinds of a fool bringing it up. 

“Gull! Spit it out before .5 loses 
his patience!” 

Gull shrugged, looked his chief 
in the eye and said rapidly, “Perl- 
man said you’ve been dead since ’97, 
sir.” And he waited for the blow to 
fall. 

S urprisingly, it did not. .5 merely 
continued to look at him, silent- 
ly, levelly, appraisingly. There was 
not even a hint of surprise in his 
expression. At length McIntyre 
laughed one sharp, desiccated sort of 
laugh and Gull turned gratefully 
toward him, glad to be taken off 
the. hook. “Nonsense, of course, Mc- 
Intyre,” he said. “I really hated to 
have to say it.” 

But McIntyre was raising a hand, 
chuckling in a sort of painful way, 
as though laughter hurt him. “Never 
mind, Gull,” he said. “After all, 
you’re not expected to evaluate in- 
formation. Just go on and do your 
job. And now, .5 had best be left 
alone for a while; there are other 
matters concerning us, you know.” 
And, very grateful to have it hap- 
pen, Gull found himself and the girl 
outside. He discovered he was sweat- 
ing. “Whew,” he exclaimed. 
“Wouldn’t want to go through that 
again. And now, my dear, I suggest 
a drink — thereafter a wedding — 
then a honeymoon. Not necessarily 
in that order.” 

“Gladly, dearest Meesta Gull!” 
she cried. “And I don’t give a ’ang 
about the order!” END

MOON DUEL 

by FRITZ LEIBER 



Out there on the face of 
the moon was his enemy — 
and also his only friend / 



F irst hint I had we’d been 
spotted by a crusoe was a 
little tick coming to my moonsuit 
from the miniradar Pete and I were 
gaily heaving into position near the 
east end of Gioja crater to scan 
for wrecks, trash, and nodules of 
raw metal. 

Then came a whish which cut 
off the , instant Pete’s hand lost 
contact with the squat instrument. 
His gauntlet, silvery in the raw low 
polar sunlight, drew away very 
slowly, as if he’d grown faintly 
disgusted with our activity. My gaze 
kept on turning to see the whole 
shimmering back of his helmet 
blown off in a gorgeous sickening 
brain-fog and blood-mist that was 
already falling in the vacuum as 
fine red snow. 



A loud tock then and glove-sting 
as the crusoe’s second slug hit the 
miniradar, but my gaze had gone 
back to the direction Pete had been 
facing when he bought it — in time 
to see the green needle-flash of 
the crusoe’s gun in a notch in 
Gioja’s low wall, where the black 
of the shadowed rock met the gem- 
like starfields along a jagged border; 
I unslung my Swift* as I dodged a 
long step to the side and squeezed 
off three shots. The first two shells 
must have traveled a touch too 
high, but the third made a beautiful 
fleeting violet globe at the base of 



* All-purpose vacuum rifle named for the 
.22 cartridge which as early as 1940 was 
being produced by Winchester, Reming- 
ton, and Norma with factory loads giv- 
ing it a muzzle velocity of 4,140 feet, 
almost a mile, a second.

the notch. I: didn’t show me a 
figure, whole or shattered, silvery 
or otherwise, on the wall or atop 
it, but then some crusoes are cam- 
ouflaged like chameleons and most 
of them move very fast. 

Pete’s suit was still falling slowly 
and stiffly forward. Three dozen 
yards beyond was a wide black 
fissure, though exactly how wide I 
couldn’t tell because much of the 
opposite lip merged into the shadow 
of the wall. I scooted toward it like 
a rat toward a hole. On my third 
«tep, I caught up Pete by his tool 
belt and oxy tube while his falling 
front was still inches away from the 
powdered pumice, and I heaved him 
along with me. Some slow or over- 
drilled part of my brain hadn’t yet 
accepted he was dead. 

^^Then I began to skim forward, 
inches above the ground my- 
self, kicking back against rocky 
outcrops thrusting up through the 
dust — it was like fin-swimming. 
The crusoe couldn’t have been ex- 
pecting this nut stunt, by which I 
at least avoided the dreamy sitting- 
duck slowness of safer, higher- 
bounding moon-running, for there 
was a green flash behind me and 
hurtled dust faintly pittered my 
soles and seat. He hadn’t been lead- 
ing his target enough. Also, I knew 
now he had shells as well as slugs. 

I" was diving over the lip three 
•econds after skoot-off when Pete’s 
boot caught solidly against a last 
hooky outcrop. The something in 
my brain was still stubborn, for 1 
clutched him like clamps, which 
made me swing around with a jerk. 



But even that was lucky, for a 
bright globe two yards through 
winked on five yards ahead like a 
mammoth firefly’s flash, but not 
quite as gentle, for the invisible 
rarified explosion-front hit me hard 
enough to boom my suit and make 
the air inside slap me. Now I knew 
he had metal-proximity fuses on 
some of his shells too — they must 
be very good at mini-stuff on his 
home planet. 

The tail of the pale green flash 
showed me the fissure’s bottom a 
hundred yards straight below and 
all dust, as 90 percent of them 
are — pray God the dust was deep. 
I had time to thumb Extreme 
Emergency to the ship for it to 
relay automatically to Circumluna. 
Then the lip had cut me off from 
the ship and I had lazily fallen out 
of the glare into the blessed black- 
ness, the dial lights in my helmet 
already snapped off — even they 
might make enough glow for the 
crusoe to aim by. The slug had 
switched off Pete’s. 

Ten, twelve seconds to fall and 
the opposite lip wasn’t cutting off 
the notched crater wall. I could feel 
the crusoe’s gun trailing me down — 
he’d know moon-G, sticky old 
5-foot. I could feel his tentacle or 
finger or claw or ameboid bump 
tightening on the trigger or button 
or what. I shoved Pete away from 
me, parallel to the fissure wall, as 
hard as I could. Three more seconds, 
four, and my suit boomed again 
and I was walloped as another green 
flash showed me the smooth-sifted 
floor moving up and beginning to 
hurry a little. This flash was a 



42 



IF 




hemisphere, not a globe — it had 
burst against the wall — but if 
there were any rock fragments they 
missed me. And it exactly bisected 
the straight line between me and 
Pete’s silvery coffin. The crusoe 
knew his gun and his Luna — I 
really admired him, even if my 
shove had pushed Pete and me, 
action and reaction, just enough out 
of the target path. Then the fissure 
lip had cut the notch and I was 
readying to land like a three-legged 
crab, my Swift reslung, my free 
hand on my belted dust-shoes. 

E leven seconds’ fall on Luna is 
not much more than two on 
earth, but either are enough to build 
up a velocity of over 50 feet a 
second. The dust jarred me hard, 
but thank God there were no reefs 
in it. It covered at least all the 
limbs and front of me, including 
my helmet-front — my dial lights, 
snapped on again, showed a gray- 
ness fine-grained as flour. 

The stuff resisted like flour, too, 
as I unbelted my dust-shoes. Using 
them for a purchase, I pulled my 
other arm and helmet-front free. 
The stars looked good, even gray- 
dusted. With a hand on each shoe, 
I dragged out my legs and, balanc- 
ing gingerly on the slithery stuff, 
got each of my feet snapped to a 
shoe. Then I raised up and switched 
on my headlight. I hated that. I 
no more wanted to do it than a 
hunted animal wants to break twigs 
or show itself on the skyline, but I 
knew I had exactly as long to find 
cover as it would take the crusoe 
to lope from the notch to the 



opposite lip of the fissure. Most of 
them lope very fast, they’re that 
keen on killing. 

WelU we started the killing, I 
reminded myself. This time Tm the 
quarry. 

My searchlight made a perverse 
point of hitting Pete’s shimmering 
casket, spread-eagled, seven-eighths 
submerged, like a man floating on 
his back. I swung the beam steadily. 
The opposite wall was smooth ex- 
cept for a few ledges and cracks 
and there wasn’t any overhang to 
give a man below cover from some- 
one on top. 

But a section of the wall on my 
side, not fifty yards away, was 
hugely pocked with holes and half- 
bubbles where the primeval lava had 
foamed high and big against the 
feeble plucking of lunar gravity. I 
aimed myself at the center of that 
section and started out. I switched 
off my headlight and guided myself 
by the wide band of starfields. 

You walk dust-shoes with much 
the same vertical lift and low me- 
thodical forward swing as snow- 
shoes. It was nostalgic, but hunted 
animals have no time for memory- 
delicatessen. 

Suddenly there was more and 
redder brightness overhead than the 
stars. A narrow ribbon of rock 
along the top of the opposite wall 
was glaringly bathed in orange, 
while the rim peaks beyond glowed 
faintly, like smoldering volcanoes. 
Light from the orange ribbon 
bounced down into my fissure, 
caroming back and forth between 
the walls until I could dimly see 
again the holes I was headed for.

T he crusoe had popped our ship 
— both tanks, close together, 
so that the sun-warmed gasses, ex- 
ploding out into each other, burned 
like a hundred torches. The oxy- 
aniline lasted until I reached the 
holes. I crawled through the biggest. 
The fading glow dimly and fleet- 
ingly showed a rock-bubble twelve 
feet across with another hole at the 
back of it. The stuff looked black, 
felt rough yet diamond-hard. I 
risked n look behind me. 

The ribbon glow was darkest 
red — the skeleton of our ship still 
aglow. The ribbon flashed green in 
the middle — a tiny venomous dag- 
ger — and then a huge pale green 
firefly winked where Pete lay. He’d 
saved me a fourth time. 

I had barely pushed sideways back 
when there was another of those 
winks just outside my hole, this one 
glaringly bright, its front walloping 
me. I heard through the rock faint 
tings of fragments of Pete’s suit 
hitting the wall, but they may have 
been only residual ringings, from 
the nearer blast, in my suit or ears. 

1 scrambled through the back 
door in the bubble into a space 
which 1 made out by crawling to be 
a second bubble, resembling the first 
even to having a back door. I went 
through that third hole and turned 
around and rested my Swift’s muzzle 
on the rough-scooped threshold. 
Since the crusoe lived around here, 
he’d know the territory better wher- 
ever I went. Why retreat farther 
and get lost? My dial lights showed 
that about a minute and a half 
had gone by since Pete bought it. 
Also, I wasn’t losing pressure and I 



had oxy and heat for four hours- — 
Circumluna would be able to deliver 
a rescue force in half that time, 
if my message had got through and 
if the crusoe didn’t scupper them 
too. Then I got goosy again about 
the glow of the dial lights and 
snapped them off. I started to 
change position and was suddenly 
afraid the crusoe might already be 
trailing me by my transmitted 
sounds through the rock, and right 
away I held stock still and started 
to listen for him. 

N o light, no sound, a ghost- 
fingered gravity — it was like 
being tested for sanity-span in an 
anechoic chamber. Almost at once 
dizziness and the sensory mi- 
rages started to come, swimming in 
blue and burnt and moaning from 
the peripheries of my senses — even 
waiting in ambush for a crusoe 
wouldn’t stop them; I guess I wanted 
them to come. So though straining 
every sense against the crusoe’s 
approach, I had at last to start 
thinking about him. 

It’s strange that men should have 
looked at the moon for millennia 
and never guessed it was exactly 
what it looked like: a pale marble 
graveyard for living dead men, a 
Dry Tortuga of space where the 
silver ships from a million worlds 
marooned their mutineers, their re- 
calcitrants, their criminals, their 
lunatics. Not on fertile warm-blan- 
keted earth with its quaint adoles- 
cent race, which such beings might 
harm, but on the great silver rock 
of earth’s satellite, to drag out their 
solitary furious lives, each with his 



IF 




suit and gun and lonely hut or hole, 
living by recycling his wastes; re- 
cycling, too, the bitter angers and 
hates and delusions which had 
brought him there. As many as a 
thousand of them, enough to 
mine the moon for meals and 
fuel-gases and to reconquer space 
and perhaps become masters 
of earth — had they chosen to 
cooperate. But their refusal to 
cooperate was the very thing for 
which they’d been marooned, and 
besides that they were of a half 
thousand different galactic breeds. 
And so although they had some sort 
of electronic or psionic or what-not 
grapevine — at least what happened 
to one maroon became swiftly 
known to the others — each of them 
remained a solitary Friday-less Rob- 
inson Crusoe, hence the name. 

I risked flashing my time dial. 
Only another thirty seconds gone. 
At this rate it would take an 
eternity for the two hours to pass 
before I could expect aid if my 
call had got through, while the 
crusoe — As my senses screwed 
themselves tighter to their task, my 
thoughts went whirling off again. 

Earthmen shot down the first 
crusoe they met — in a moment of 
fumbling panic and against all their 
training. Ever since then the crusoes 
have shot first, or tried to, ignoring 
our belated efforts to communicate. 

1 brooded for what I thought 
was a very short while about 
the age-old problem of a universal 
galactic code, yet when I flashed 
my time dial again, seventy minutes 
had gone somewhere. 



That really froze me. He’d had 
time to stalk and kill me a dozen 
times — he’d had time to go home 
and fetch his dogs! — my senses 
couldn’t be that good protection 
with my mind away. Why even now, 
straining them in my fear, all I got 
was my own personal static: I heard 
my heart pounding, my blood roar- 
ing, I think for a bit- I heard the 
Brownian movement of the air 
molecules against my eardrums. 

What I hadn’t been doing, I told 
myself, was thinking about the cru- 
soe in a systematic way. 

He had a gun like mine and at 
least three sorts of ammo. 

He’d made it from notch to 
fissure-lip in forty seconds or less — 
he must be a fast loper, whatever 
number feet; he might well have a 
jet unit. 

And he’d shot at the miniradar 
ahead of me. Had he thought it a 
communicator? — a weapon? — or 
some sort of robot as dangerous as 
a man . ? 

My heart had quieted, my ears 
had stopped roaring, and in that 
instant I heard through the rock the 
faintest scratching. 

Scratch-scratchy scratch-scratch , 
scratchy scratch , scratch it went, 
each time a little louder. 

I flipped on my searchlight and 
there coming toward me across the 
floor of the bubble outside mine 
was a silver spider as wide as a 
platter with four opalescent eyes and 
a green-banded body. Its hanging 
jaws were like inward - curving 
notched scissor blades. 

I fired by automatism as I fell 
back. The spider’s bubble was filled 



MOON DUEL 



45 




with violet glare instantly followed 
by green. I was twice walloped by 
explosion-fronts and knocked down. 

That hardly slowed me a second. 
The same flashes had shown me a 
hole in the top of my bubble and 
as soon as I’d scrambled to my feet 
I leaped toward it. 

I did remember to leap gently. 
My right hand caught the black rim 
of the hole and it didn’t break off 
and I drew myself up into the black 
bubble above. It had no hole in 
the top, but two high ones in the 
sides, and I went through the higher 
one. 

I kept on that way. The great 
igneous bubbles were almost 
uniform. I always took the highest 
exit. Once I got inside a bubble 
with no exit and had to backtrack. 
After that I scanned first. I kept 
my searchlight on. 

I’d gone through seven or seven- 
teen bubbles before I could start 
to think about what had happened. 

That spider had almost certainly 
not been my crusoe — or else there 
was a troop of them dragging a rifle 
like an artillery piece. And it hadn’t 
likely been an hitherto-unknown, 
theoretically impossible, live va- 
cuum-arthropod — or else the exotic 
biologists were in for a great sur- 
prise and I’d been right to wet my 
pants. No, it had most likely been 
a tracking or tracking-and-attack 
robot of some sort. Eight legs are a 
useful number, likewise eight hands. 
Were the jaws for cutting through 
suit armor? Maybe it was a robot 
pet for a lonely being. Here, Spid! 
The second explosion? Either the 



crusoe had fired into the chamber 
from the other side, or else the spi- 
der had carried a bomb to explode 
when it touched me. Fine use to 
make of a pet! I giggled. I was 
relieved, I guess, to think it likely 
that the spider had been “only” a 
robot. 

Just then — I was in the ninth 
or nineteenth bubble — the inside of 
my helmet misted over everywhere. 
I was panting and sweating and my 
dehumidifier had overloaded. It was 
as if I were in a real peasouper 
of a fog. I could barely make out 
the black loom of the wall behind 
me. I switched out my headlight. 
My time dial showed seventy-two 
minutes gone. I switched it off and 
then I did a queer thing. 

I leaned back very carefully until 
as much of my suit as possible 
touched rock. Then I measuredly 
thumped the rock ten times with 
the butt of my Swift and held very 
still. 

Starting with ten would mean we 
were using the decimal system. Of 
course there were other possibilities, 
but . 

Very faintly, coming at the same 
rate as mine, I heard six thuds. 

What constant started with six? 
If he’d started with three, I’d have 
given him one, and so on through 
a few more places of pi. Or if with 
one, I’d have given him four — and 
then started to worry about the 
third and fourth places in the square 
root of two. I might take his signal 
for the beginning of a series with 
the interval of minus four and rap 
him back two, but then how could 
he rap me minus two? Oh why 



46 



IF 




hadn't I simply started rapping out 
primes? Of course all the integers, 
in fact all the real numbers, from 
thirty seven through forty one had 
square roots beginning with six, but 
which one . ? 

Suddenly f heard a scratching . 

M y searchbeam was on again, my 
helmet had unmisted, my 
present bubble was empty. 

Just the same I scuttled out of 
it, still trending upward where I 
could. But now the holes wouldn’t 
trend that way. They kept going two 
down for one up and the lines of 
bubbles zigzagged. I wanted to go 
back, but then I might hear the 
scratching. Once the bubbles started 
getting smaller. It was like being in 
solid black suds. I lost any sense of 
direction. I began to lose the sense 
of up-down. What’s moon-gravity to 
the numbness of psychosis? I kept 
my searchlight on although I was 
sure the glow it made must reach 
ten bubbles away. I looked all 
around every bubble before I en- 
tered it, especially the overhang just 
above the entry hole. 

Every once in a while I would 
hear somebody saying Six! Six? 
Six! like that and then very rapidly 
seven - eight - nine - five - four* 
three two one - naught. How 
would you rap naught in the deci- 
mal system? That one I finally 
solved: you’d rap ten. 

Finally I came into a bubble that 
had a side-hole four feet across and 
edged at the top with diamonds. 
Very fancy. Was this the Spider 
Princess’ boudoir? There was also a 
top hole but I didn’t bother with 



that — it had no decor. I switched 
off my searchlight and looked out 
the window without exposing my 
head. The diamonds were stars. 
After a bit I made out what 1 took 
to be the opposite lip of the fissure 
I’d first dove in, only about one 
hundred feet above me. The rim- 
wall beyond looked vaguely familiar, 
though I wasn’t sure about the 
notch. My time dial said one hun- 
dred eighteen minutes gone as I 
switched it off. Almost time to 
start hoping for rescue. Oh great! — 
with their ship a sitting duck for 
the crusoe they wouldn’t be expect- 
ing. I hadn’t signaled a word be- 
sides Extreme Emergency. 

I moved forward and sat in the 
window, one leg outside, my Swift 
under my left arm. I plucked a 
flash-grenade set for five seconds 
from my belt, pulled the fuse and 
tossed it across the fissure, almost 
hard enough to reach the opposite 
wall. 

I looked down, my Swift swinging 
like my gaze. 

The fissure lit up like a boule- 
vard. Across from me I knew the 
flare was dropping dreamily, but I 
wasn’t looking that way. Right be- 
low me, two hundred feet down, I 
saw a transparent helmet with some- 
thing green and round and crested 
inside and with shoulders under it. 

Just then I heard the scratching 
again, quite close. 

1 fired at once. My shell made 
a violet burst and raised a 
fountain of dust twenty feet from 
the crusoe. I scrambled back into 
my bubble, switching on my scarch-

light. Another spider was coming in 
on the opposite side, its legs moving 
fast. I jumped for the top-hole and 
grabbed its rim with my free hand. 
I’d have dropped my Swift if I’d 
needed my other hand, but I didn’t. 
As I pulled myself up and through, 
I looked down and saw the spider 
straight below me eyeing me with 
its uptilted opalescent eyes and 
doubling its silver legs. Then it 
straightened its legs and sprang up 
toward me, not very fast but enough 
against Luna’s feeble gravitational 
tug to put it into this upper room 
with me. I knew it mustn’t touch 
me and I mustn’t touch it by 
batting at it. I had started to shift 
the explosive shell in my gun for a 
slug, and its green-banded body 
was growing larger, when there was 
a green blast in the window below 
and its explosion-front, booming 
my suit a little, knocked the spider 
aside and out of sight before it 
made it through the trap door of 
my new bubble. Yet the spider 
didn’t explode, if that was what 
had happened to the first one; at any 
rate there was no second green 
flash. 

My new bubble had a top hole 
too and I went through it the same 
way I had the last. The next five 
bubbles were just the same too. I 
told myself that my routine was 
getting to be like that of a circus 
acrobat — except who stages shows 
inside black solidity? — except the 
gods maybe with the dreams they 
send us. The lava should be trans- 
parent, so the rim-wall peaks could 
admire. 

At the same time I was thinking 



how if the biped humanoid shape 
is a good one for medium-size 
creatures on any planet, why so the 
spider shape is a good one for 
tiny creatures and apt to turn up 
anywhere and be copied in robots 
too. 

The top hole in the sixth bubble 
showed me the stars, while one 
half of its rim shone white with 
sunlight. 

Panting, 1 lay back against the 
rock. I switched off my searchlight. 
1 didn’t hear any scratching. 

The stars. The stars were energy. 
They filled the universe with light, 
except for hidey holes and shadows 
here and there. 

Then the number came to me. 
With the butt of my Swift I rapped 
out five. No answer. No scratching 
either. I rapped out five again. 

Then the answer came, ever so 
faintly. Five knocked back at me. 

Six five five — Planck’s Constant, 
the invariant quantum of energy. 
Oh, it should be to the minus 29th 
power, of course, but I couldn’t 
think how to rap that and, besides, 
the basic integers were all that 
mattered. 

I heard the scratching . 

1 sprang and caught the rim and 
lifted myself into the glaring 
sunlight . and stopped with my 
body midway. 

Facing me a hundred feet away, 
midway through another top-hole — 
he must have come very swiftly by 
another branch of the bubble ladder 
— he’d know the swiftest ones — 
was my green-crested crusoe. His 
face had a third eye where a man’s 



48 



IF 




nose would be, which with his crest 
made him look like a creature of 
mythology. We were holding our 
guns vertically. 

We looked like two of the 
damned, half out of their holes in 
the floor of Dante’s hell. 

I climbed very slowly out of my 
hole, still pointing my gun toward 
the zenith. So did he. 

We held very still for a moment. 
Then with his gun butt he rapped 
out ten. I could both see and also 
hear it through the rock. 

I rapped out three. Then, as if 
the black bubble-world were one 
level of existence and this another, 
I wondered why we were going 
through this rigamarole. We each 
knew the other had a suit and a 
gun (and a lonely hole?) and so we 
knew we were both intelligent and 
knew math. So why was our rapping 
so precious? 

He raised his gun — I think to 
rap out one, to start off pi. 

But I’ll never be sure, for just 
then there were two violet bursts, 
close together, against the fissure- 
wall, quite close to him. 

He started to swing the muzzle 
of his gun toward me. At least I 
think he did. He must know violet 
was the color of my explosions. I 
know I thought someone on my 
side was shooting. And I must have 
thought he was going to shoot me 
— because a violet dagger leaped 
from my Swift’s muzzle and I felt 
its sharp recoil and then there was 
a violet globe where he was standing 



and moments later some fragment 
twinged lightly against my chest — 
a playful ironic tap. 

He was blown apart pretty thor- 
oughly, all his constants scattered, 
including — I’m sure — Planck’s. 

I t was another half hour before 
the rescue ship from Circum- 
luna landed. I spent it looking at 
earth low on the horizon and watch- 
ing around for the spider, but I 
never saw it. The rescue party 
never found it either, though they 
made quite a hunt — with me help- 
ing after I’d rested a bit and had 
my batteries and oxy replenished. 
Either its power went off when its 
master died, or it was set to 
“freeze” then, or most likely go into 
a “hide” behavior pattern. Likely it’s 
still out there waiting for an in- 
cautious earthman, like a rattlesnake 
in the desert or an old, forgotten 
land mine. 

I also figured out, while waiting 
in Gioja crater, there near the north 
pole on the edge of Shackleton 
crater, the only explanation I’ve 
ever been able to make, though it’s 
something of a whopper, of the two 
violet flashes which ended my little 
mathematical friendship-chant with 
the crusoe. They were the first two 
shells I squeezed off at him — the 
ones that skimmed the notch. They 
had the velocity to orbit Luna and 
the time they took — two hours and 
five minutes — was right enough. 

Oh, the consequences of our past 
actions! END

I t is tempting to read time back- 
wards and come up with some- 
thing like, “The moment I stepped 
aboard the ship I knew our expedi- 
tion was doomed.” To stuff one’s 
ego as a critic of the past is easier 
than as a creator of moments yet 
to come. 

The nearest to any precognition 
I can claim is a muddled unhappy 
impression after meeting Director 
Litzanov, first his high-pitched nasal 
voice carried to me on chill winds, 
and second, his words. “You are 
younger than Banning led me to 
expect, Doctor Maxwell. I assume he 
can still select a capable representa- 
tive in his field, but you look like 
an undergraduate.” 

Next he indicated my guitar on 
the luggage cart. “Do you make 
noise with that in addition to the 
piano Banning mentioned? Wouldn’t 
a reference library of micro-books 
make better use of your space al- 
lotment?” 

But my colleagues didn’t think so. 
Soon after Explorer II lifted into 
space they gathered regularly in the 
crowded little ward room to ask for 
music. Litzanov never attended. 

I caught Jim Larsen, our geolo- 
gist, watching me quizzically after 
one of those dogged pass-throughs. 
My face must have sagged like an 
old time astronaut’s at five G’s be- 
cause Jim chuckled. “What has he 
got against music?” I growled. 

“You’re dealing with someone 
completely tone-deaf,” Jim answer- 
ed. “Also, sound in measured tempo 
sends him into a frenzy.” 



Looking backward I might have 
picked up another foreshadowing 
hint of trouble. They hauled a stow- 
away from a supply locker, probably 
the first in space travel history, a 
scrawny kid of fifteen. I heard Lar- 
sen’s incredulous exclamation, “So 
Binky finally made it!” 

Commander Jacobs muttered, “He 
made it all right. Somebody should 
have clobbered him the first day he 
wandered on the base.” 

Jim gave me the score. “Binkv’s 
a deaf-mute. Father was one of the 
early explorer pilots — died young 
from radiation. A lot of those early 
spacers’ kids didn’t get born right.” 
And the captain growled, “It’s a 
hell of a problem to have on your 
back for the next ten months. I can 
message the mother, but — ” He 
roared at the crew members. “Get 
the boy for’ard.” 

I didn’t like the way they yanked 
Binky to his feet. The men were 
surly after the commander’s angry 
lecture and not inclined to handle 
the stowaway with gentleness. To 
see a dog kicked makes me soft- 
headed: I stuck my neck out. “Why 
not turn him over to me? Fll see 
that he stays out of your way.” 
Litzanov’s dry nasality echoed 
down the passageway. “I suggest 
that you do not add responsibilities 
which might interfere with efficiency 
of your work, Doctor Maxwell. This 
problem does not concern ‘he re- 
search party.” 

Temper boils when somebody tries 
to push me around, and needs an 
effort to choke down. I tramped 
on my impulse to answer and drop- 
ped an arm across Binky’s shoulders.

IF 




E ven old hands on Explorer II 
had never seen anything like 
the planet we were assigned to ex- 
amine. When we broke out into 
normal space-time it revolved there 
on the black canvas of an endless 
cosmos like a bright light — not 
blindingly sharp as a sun, but radiat- 
ing a pale violet nimbus which lent 
a deceptive transparency to the 
sphere, as if the molten sheen of its 
heart rock somehow found a way 
to the surface. Everyone who could 
crowd to a viewport stayed there, 
fascinated. Magnifications showed 
the most completely landscaped 
areas any of us had ever seen, as if 
the entire planet had come under 
one central plan of formal garden- 
ing — park regions of deliberately 
designed wildness, shaded roadways 
laid out specifically for appearance 
of their patterned crossings from the 
air, buildings whose shapes, colors 
and spacing upon the land brought 
a pleasurable response aesthetically. 

Massive mountain ranges topped 
by cliffs of a quartz-like stone 
stretched across the world, all with 
a north-south orientation, so that 
during approach orbit we seemed to 
be peering at a globe upon which 
longitudinal lines had been traced 
in relief. From these came the shim- 
mering aura of the planet. 

By conduction of volcanic incan- 
descense deep in its interior? By ab- 
sorption and reflection from its sun? 
We never became certain. Due to 
this luminescence the night side only 
subdued daylight and tinged it wi 4 h 
a deeper violet cast, so that there 
was never complete darkness. 
“Those cliffs must be gigantic 



crystal formations,” Jim Larsen mut- 
tered. “What else could explain the 
way light appears to be conducted 
through them?” 

We touched down upon a dead 
world. Nothing about the pleasant 
meadow where we landed should 
have given such an impression, but 
it lurked there like an infusion of 
the peculiar psychic miasma which 
permeates the air of a’ cemetery. 
Warmth of late spring should have 
sent men, long imprisoned within a 
claustrophobic capsule, to cavorting 
wildly across lush grass flats, but 
even the most insensitive stepped off 
our landing stage as if he were 
entering a cathedral. We stood, and 
looked silently, and knew that the 
race which had built so wonderfully 
had ceased to exist. 

There was no bird song, no thin 
sibilance of insects, no whirr of 
wind, no distant voice of animal or 
man. And yet I sensed something all 
around me, almost as if it were 
sound, not recognizable to ears, 
however, as resonance. To my mu- 
sician’s acuteness it seemed to pos- 
sess pitch, though I could not have 
argued that point successfully. Jim 
Larsen was inclined to think it a 
psychological response to a strange 
environment. 

I tried to find words for describ- 
ing the phenomenon as it affected 
me. In the day’s warmth I thought 
of it as a pitch far above the abil'ty 
of human ears to respond. When 
night touched us it seemed some- 
thing below the threshhold of hear- 
ing, frequencies below the deepest 
notes of a river beating itself to 
froth against the walls of a gorge, 



THE PLANET PLAYER 



53 




below the darkness of a dream. And 
yet I had not been aware of when 
that change in pitch occurred — if 
it had. 

n 

I discovered then why I had seen 
Director Litzanov on the news 
screens so frequently; he was not 
unacquainted with the persuasive 
powers of personal publicity. He de- 
served accolades; he knew his own 
field and could perform in it with 
distinction. But like most administra- 
tors he actively spread his own im- 
age and the more spectacular aspects 
of his accomplishments, omitting 
by purposeful oversight anything 
which might remind the public that 
his newsworthy activities depended 
upon cooperative investigation by 
many trained minds supplying pieces 
for the mosaic in which he could 
center himself. 

And so our first project for the 
day was a picture. “We must make 
certain that what we do here, gen- 
demen,” he said, "Is preserved for 
all time in an adequate record.” 

And so our party’s photographer 
rehearsed us until he was satisfied 
with the mimed spontaneity of fiist 
setting foot upon a strange world, 
then shot the picture — to be shown 
eventually upon Earth's video 
screens: explorers disembarking 

from the star ship, turning to await 
our leader, his appearance in the 
open hatch, a sweep of his arm 
toward distance, our faces swivelling 
to follow the gesture, a camera pan 
to glimpses of alien buildings over 
distant tree tops — structures actual- 



ly hidden by those trees but which 
would be photographed from anoth- 
er viewpoint and spliced into the 
completed film. Voices and inci- 
dental sound would be dubbed in 
later. 

I felt an idol of my innocent 
days shatter; I had seen this basic 
sequence often on video during my 
undergraduate years, stirring then 
my imagination and determination to 
become worthy of a place on Di- 
rector Litzanov’s staff. He had 
seemed the epitome of the glamo- 
rous research-scholar to my wor- 
shipping young soul. Now was the 
day of awakening to the shams which 
dramatize man’s accomplishments. I 
vowed that if ever I advanced to 
leadership of my peers I would 
accept it as a trust rather than an 
elevation. In cynical moments since 
I have wondered if I would re- 
member that vow. 

We traversed the woodlands and 
came upon a wide thoroughfare. 
From its end paths ascended by 
steep ramps a series of increasing- 
ly higher terraces forming a mile 
long pyramidal base for a magnifi- 
cent collection of tall structures lo- 
cated in the center of an extensive 
valley between two high ridges of 
white and rose colored stone. It 
was the consensus of the party that 
this complex must be the planet’s 
governing center or cultural mecca. 

Seen from the perspective of 
ground level they were stunning 
buildings, towers and buttresses of 
the white and rose quartz-like rock, 
wall slabs of a many-hued plastic 
so hard that time had neither dulled 
its polish nor chipped its surface. 



54 



IF 




It was a shining aggregation of five 
architectural wonders, one at each, 
of the major points of the com- 
pass and one in the center. An ar- 
cade of pointed arches built from 
the same rosy crystalline rock join- 
ed the four outer buildings to form 
a ring enclosing the fifth structure 
in its middle. 

V\7 e stood in a great concourse 
* * surrounding the pyramid. From 
this circle twelve spacious avenues 
radiated, ending at the inner ring 
of another extensive pavement 
curving about the pyramid a dozen 
miles away. This second parkway 
formed a circumference from which 
three hundred and sixty roadways 
spread to girdle the planet and re- 
turn again at points exactly opposite 
on the circle from their start. 

Jim Larsen was whispering, “Mar- 
velous engineering! Daring plan- 
ners!” And I nodded, unable to look 
away from grass covered slopes that 
once had been clipped lawns sweep- 
ing upward to terrace after terrace, 
each paved by the mottled plastic 
material and balustrated with the 
strange white stone. Like giant steps 
they led to a truncated top where 
the buildings carried the pyramid’s 
natural slope to its vertex. I felt that 
I looked at a gigantic fountain 
whose jets were in the sky. 

Here Litzanov arranged another 
picture, a low-angle shot picking 
him up in the close foreground 
against a backdrop of the pyramid 
as he commented upon the architec- 
tural miracle to his chief scientists, 
then a fade-out with them admiring 
the beauty he indicated. 



Jim Larsen grumbled with mild 
amusement, “I suppose these phony 
interludes advance the cause among 
people back on Earth who pay our 
salaries and grants, but what a 
waste of time.” 

I laughed. “It gave Binky and 
me time to touch this venerable rel- 
ic. Tap the carved rock in that balu- 
strade lightly.” 

“Why?” But he snapped a finger 
against the railing and turned to 
stare at me, then back to repeat the 
feather-weight thump. “You wouldn't 
try to fool me into believing a flick 
of one finger could start vibrations 
through solid rock, would you?” 

“Did I suggest that it would?” 

“No,” he admitted. 

I said, “I still don’t really believe 
I felt anything, but after seeing 
Binky react, then watching you go 
through the same experience — well, 
what did happen?” 

Instead of answering he struck 
the post a strong blow, keeping fin- 
ger tips of his left hand on the rock 
to sense any effect. 

“Feel anything?” I asked, and he 
shook his head. 

I scrounged a steel bar from a 
crew man and swung at the bal- 
uster. Jim laughed. “This rock is 
absolutely dead. I couldn’t feel a 
single shiver.” 

Without any real purpose I flick- 
ed my finger against it and saw 
Larsen jerk his hand away, then 
touch his finger tips back to the 
stone. “Do that again,” he muttered. 

I placed my fingers beside his 
and repeated the light tap. We both 
looked at each other, neither willing 
to believe there had been a tremor. 



THE PLANET PLAYER 



55 




Jim grunted, “Were a couple of 
yahoos fooling ourselves.” 

“You think we’re being victimized 
by a little mental suggestion?” 
“Let’s say we don’t believe any- 
thing yet and high-tail it after the 
others.” But I heard him mumbling, 
“If a finger tap can start vibrations, 
then a crowbar should have made 
the thing ring like a bell.” 

That worried me too. And I stew- 
ed over why a race would desert 
a world so beautifully designed. 

B ut we found those suppositions 
were false. Binky discovered 
the inhabitants. Ranging ahead like 
a wild colt he blundered into them 
near the top terrace and rushed 
back to us, pointing. Many were 
mummified; some were fragments, 
powdering bones, skulls that crum- 
bled from countless seasons deteri- 
oration when touched — hundreds 
grouped on the last slope — then 
through the arcade’s delicate arches 
to sight of an amphitheatre within, 
and thousands of grinning skulls, 
weathered remnants of the creators 
of this beauty. 

They lay in orderly rows as they 
had sat, centuries ago, attending 
some spectacle in that tremendous 
outdoor theatre where a blue-violet 
sky made fragile silhouettes of the 
surrounding arches and curved over- 
head into a vaulted roof that seem- 
ed as substantial as plastic, as near 
as a ceiling, and as far as infinity. 
And from where we stood at the 
circling line of rosy-white arcade the 
amphitheatre bowl spread before us, 
completely surrounding the high- 
reaching central building, its far side 



dim in heavy violet of the atmo- 
sphere — acres of beautifully wrought 
seats cast from plastic, shining with 
a gloss that made them seem instal- 
lations of only days ago rather than 
aged by unnumbered centuries. And 
on each seat, or spilled to the aisle 
in front of it, pitiful pieces of what 
was once life. 

I heard myself saying, “They must 
not have known death was approach- 
ing, even when it struck.” 

“Wiped out in a single instant,” 
Jim mused, “while they watched 
some kind of performance.” 

I agreed. “There is no indication 
of panic. Skeletons that have not 
broken apart, or bodies which mum- 
mified, are all in seated postures.” 

And that was as far as we could 
go on speculation. 

There is no need to list the rou- 
tines of prying into a dead civiliza- 
tion’s hidden mysteries. On any site, 
if it has been covered by drifting 
debris of time, one digs — and lifts 
more shovels of dirt than treasure. 
When time neglects to spread a 
wind-borne or alluvial blanket upon 
the remains, then come monotonous 
days of measuring, charting, photo- 
graphing. Scouts, criss-crossing the 
planet in skimmers, reported that 
conditions everywhere apparently 
were the same as we found them 
here. Evidently each inhabitant on 
the hapless globe had died at the 
same instant, without enough warn- 
ing to cause him to look up from 
whatever task engaged him at his 
moment of destiny. 

“Radiation of some sort?” Jim and 
I asked each other repeatedly. The 
other always replied, “None that 



56 



IF 




man knows could do it without dis- 
turbing the population enough to 
leave signs of terror.” 

'1157'ork began to concentrate in 
* * the four structures at the pyr- 
amid’s corners, for three were dis- 
covered to be museums and librar- 
ies, and the fourth certainly was an 
administration center. Tremendous 
window spaces pierced their walls. 
It was assumed by most that no win- 
dow enclosures had been intended, 
but Jim Larsen became curious 
about grooves in the stone border- 
ing these openings and drifts of fine- 
ly pulverized metal caught in an- 
gles scattering winds could not 
reach. 

One evening he walked from the 
expedition’s laboratory and announc- 
ed, “That powder is glass, so disin- 
tegrated that only chemical tests 
could indicate what it had been.” 

And later he told me, “I cannot 
understand what sort of force re- 
duced it to absolute powder. Broken 
pieces I could accept, even down to 
microscopic size, but powder — ” 

And throughout those busy days 
I found myself listening to the sound 
I had sensed on our landing day, 
cadences not heard but felt, as if 
barely penetrating to me from an- 
other world. 

I had one day of unbelievable 
bliss. Our photographer caught me. 
“Something I saw yesterday would 
interest you, Chuck,” he said, “their 
museum of musical instruments.” 

My walk to that wing packed ex- 
citement not experienced since my 
first Christmas tree. Even though I 
had turned to science from my early 



dreams of becoming a concert pian- 
ist, music still remains a haven into 
which I retire for peace and refresh- 
ment of mind and soul. And here 
lay the musical history of an alien 
race, complete. I rushed through the 
aisles like a typical tourist anxious 
to see it all in ten glances. Then I 
started classifying methodically. 

As it had been with’ us, music 
evidently began on this world with 
log drums and simple pipes of reeds. 
I found primitive ancestors of string- 
ed instruments, though empty cen- 
turies had removed, for the present, 
identification of what substance had 
been their strings. I surmised gut. 

It is awesome and strange how 
powerful the physical forces of these 
things we call planets, suns, galaxies, 
universes loom in determining the 
patterns of things, even those items 
formed by minds and fingers of liv- 
ing creators. The fact frightens me 
at times; I wonder if I might not be, 
after all, nothing but a marionette 
dangling on pieces of thread. Separ- 
ated by the mysterious limitlessness 
of space, light years of distance, and 
millennia of time, my people and 
this alien civilization produced es- 
sentially the same devices for mak- 
ing sweet sounds. 

Oh, there were some differences, 
but I could recognize horns and 
woodwinds, and the strings and per- 
cussions. Windowless ages had rot- 
ted earlier groups whose basic sub- 
stance was wood. However, as I 
worked into periods of metal I 
found better preservation. Some re- 
sponded to my attempts to blow 
them, causing me to abandon sys- 
temmatic classification for the bal-

57 




ance of the afternoon while I tried 
one after another. I had fun making 
Earthside music on alien horns. 
Some fingered instruments, resemb- 
ling our own recorders, did not give 
back interval patterns exactly like 
those of Earth’s music. I saw a 
fascinating avenue of research open- 
ing for me, studying the scales of 
this dead race. 

R eed instruments were unplayable 
until 1 reached a section dis- 
playing the final era in development 
of this alien art. There woods 
and metals had given way to various 
forms of plastic. Surprisingly, their 
reeds were also of molded material 
and still marvelously flexible. And 
I thanked all the powers for the 
thoroughness of my conservatory 
training; 1 still possessed enough 
background to bring harmonious 
sound from the throats of these 
alien substitutes for clarinets and 
oboes and bassoons. They were 
strangely mellow, with astonishing 
sweetness and resonance and as- 
tounding amplification, much strong- 
er than Earthside woodwinds. 

Then I came upon the ultimate 
forms of their drums, what we would 
have called tympani. 1 thought they 
were mock-ups, for their kettles ap- 
peared to be the rosy white stone 
which had mystified Jim Larsen and 
me on the terraces. Drum heads 
were fashioned from sheets of the 
same rock cut so thin that light 
cast shadows: through it. From idle 
curiosity 1 thumped one slightly and 
jerked back in surprise at the thun- 
derous tone which answered. One 
after another 1 touched them and 



got responses no percussion man in 
an Earthside orchestra could have 
achieved through his sticks. I dis- 
covered their uncanny flexibility — 
shattering explosiveness from light 
finger taps, thrumming resonantly 
when the touch was soft and quick, 
a lingering echo if my fingers rest- 
ed an instant, and low vibrations 
which were indescribable and dis- 
turbing when I alternately pressed 
and released the stone diaphragm. 

I could not resist sending out son- 
orously rolling patterns into the soft 
summer air, following them with 
whispering pulsations, building 
chords on drums tuned to different 
frequencies. And echoes suddenly 
surged back from the white cliffs 
miles across the valley, doubling the 
rhythms of my drums. 1 reacted with 
ecstatic excitement to the power of 
these instruments. Then I heard a 
shrill scream behind me. 

“Stop! Stop your nonsense!” Di- 
rector Litzanov was shouting. He 
leaned against an arch, exhausted 
from running. 

1 asked, “What is the matter?” 
and found strong projection neces- 
sary for drum thunder still rode 
the air around us. 

Gasping breaths shook him. “Doc- 
tor Maxwell, this behavior is incom- 
prehensible to me.” 

I grinned sheepishly. “Got carried 
away, I guess. But look at this 
room. One whole segment of that 
vanished society complete for us to 
study.” 

“You are not accomplishing that 
purpose by spending precious time 
at noise making, sir.” 

“We can hear those instruments 



58 



IF 




as the aliens heard them,” I pro- 
tested. “It’s a treasure find!” 

“We are concerned with a descrip- 
tive record of this people, Doctor 
Maxwell, not with becoming one of 
them.” 

I bumbled along, forgetting his 
irrational attitude toward mus- 
ic. “If we are lucky enough to find 
samples of their music scores we 
can bring their compositions to life 
again with their own instruments. 
The chord structures and melodies 
of a civilization make almost per- 
fect mirrors to the cultural and 
psychic attitudes of its members.” 
“The pranks you are indulging in 
cause distracting annoyance to those 
of my team who try to work,” he 
napped and turned away. 

I called sharply, “Doctor Litza- 
*ov, are you allowing some phobia 
to blind you to the value of this 
find?” 

He left without comment. 
Throughout our wrangle echoes 
still pounded back from both sides 
of the valley. Their sound reverber- 
ated more than an hour, merging 
finally and becoming lost in that 
strange vibration which had poured 
itself through me from my first mo- 
ments on this world. I was too 
angry then to wonder at noise con- 
tinuing so long after its initial im- 
pulses had been given. A musical 
note is simply a wave of physical 
energy which must subside in sec- 
onds by reason of having no gener- 
ating agent to keep the level of its 
force constant. Even an echo can- 
not extend its life beyond another 
moment. 



Morning brought regret for my 
impromptu drum concert; Litzanov 
blocked further exploration into 
alien music. 

“My assistant will finish that 
wing, Doctor Maxwell,” he told me. 
“The work is simple classification; 
it would be a waste of talent to bur- 
den you with trivia and routine.” 

I shrugged. 

“Since we feel the central struc- 
ture on this pyramid is religious in 
nature, significance of murals which 
cover its interior has become im- 
portant. You will contribute to our 
studies if you determine whether any 
allegorical meaning resides in the 
pictures.” 

There was nothing to do but 
shoulder my camera, take up my 
sketching pad, and go, with faithful 
Binky trotting along. 

In the amphitheatre surrounding 
the temple, ghosts walked with us 
down the aisles. I felt no shame ac- 
knowledging a grisly shiver when I 
turned at the front, for enough mum- 
mified figures remained upright in 
those seats to create illusions of a 
vast audience watching me, alien 
dead come to stare through empty 
eye sockets. I moved into the cen- 
tral building irrationally feeling that 
a hundred thousand spectators saw 
through its walls and counted my 
steps. 

Outside brilliant sunlight spread 
sharply clear, showing little of the 
amber of Earth’s Sol; inside violet 
tinted the air to gossamer unreality. 
Cursory examination had shown this 
central temple to be a tower, nearly 
two hundred feet square at the base, 
tapering slightly until its height 



THE PLANET PLAYER 



59 




broke out above that of the four 
corner buildings. From there it 
slanted to complete the great pyra- 
mid's tip. An entrance corridor op- 
ened from each side. 

VXTith my deaf-mute shadow I 
* * traversed one of these passages 
and stepped into fantastic beauty. 
We saw before us a spacious round 
hall whose walls glowed with the 
murals I had come to study. Un- 
earthly richness of reds and purples 
and blues, crackling golds and greens 
pounced upon me. Somehow light 
lay behind the pictures, deepening 
perspectives so that to look at a 
painting was to see far into a three- 
dimensional illusion. 

I said, “Binky, we’ve wandered 
into fairyland,” and felt him cling- 
ing to me. 

Hardly an inch of that interior 
was free from the radiance of those 
murals. My eyes followed up, past 
tier on tier of rose suffused white 
stone balconies, two hundred feet, 
to a canopy of delicate rose and 
white lace intricately carved from 
crystalline rock. I stared, mind seeth- 
ing, wondering at the apparent 
strength of it, for stone tendrils com- 
pletely spanned the hall’s hundred 
foot spread. Through its interstices 
I saw other sheets of delicate carv- 
ing hung above that. 

Darkness should have drowned us 
at the bottom of this enormous cir- 
cular well, for nowhere could I find 
a window in its smooth sides, nor 
detect artificial light. Yet every inch 
of the vault was flooded with violet- 
tinged brightness which seemed to 
be daylight conducted through the 



huge crystals of stone from w:u:h 
the building was constructed. There 
was no effect of transparency in the 
walls. Light apparently flowed down- 
ward in the hearts of their pris- 
matic structure, to be diffused 
throughout the shaft. 

When one pauses in the midst of 
any enclosed space possessing colos- 
sal dimensions there is a constant 
stir of sound, like the surging whis- 
per heard in a sea shell held close 
to the ear. This I thought was pre- 
sent. I accepted it as a familiar phe- 
nomenon until trained musician’s 
perceptions told me there was no 
echo in this hall. Instead, that wor- 
risome almost-sound of the planet 
vibrated through its vast emptiness, 
amplified until it seemed on the 
point of touching human ears with 
a definite note. I strained to hear it, 
but could not, quite. It floated about 
me like the memory of an unresolv- 
ed chord, a maddening repetition of 
something incomplete and waiting 
interminably, suspended for the bal- 
ance of time. 

Ramps led from balcony to bal- 
cony, and I called, “Come on Binky. 
Let’s look at those carvings on the 
ceiling,” loudly, to wake up echoes 
and reduce the eeriness of this hall 
to noises that were normal and ac- 
ceptable. No echo responded. 

Two hundred feet is a long climb, 
taxing to the breath, but from the 
topmost balcony I could look down 
upon the filigreed canopy. An in- 
credible expanse of stone openwork, 
carved into slender tendrils vining 
and twisting about each other, reach- 
ed out in whorls and spirals covering 
that entire ceiling space, and at no 



60 



IF 




point were they any larger than my 
wrists. Between the delicate designs 
I could see the floor’s violet dimness 
as if from a mountain top. Just 
above me a second stone fretwork 
spanned the titanic hall, and three 
more were suspended above that, 
with dark roughness of the true 
ceiling showing beyond. I grew dizzy 
staring through fairy-like sheets of 
rose and white filigree, wondering 
how they could have managed to 
hang there unknown centuries with- 
out shattering. 

IV 

E vening is a thinking time. In its 
quieting coolness I poured im- 
pressions of the temple into Jim Lar- 
sen’s patient ears. We watched a 
falling sun go through unfamiliar 
color stages, from blue-white through 
greens toward a deep gentian, fin- 
ally to lose itself in purple afterglow. 
Then, as if crawling darkness, stalk- 
ing that fleeing disk, had activated 
relays across the planet, the violet 
nimbus became visible, wavering like 
a ghostly phosphorescent mist from 
the gigantic pale mountain ridges, 
and the strange not-sound slipped 
back into insistent prominence, a 
spooky night-time song too deep for 
our ears. 

“Why would those aliens erect 
a massive building to enclose just 
one room whose diameter is not 
more than a hundred feet?” 

Jim’s eyes twinkled. “Are you 
implying that Earth has never had 
its big-little men who have piled 
up imposing heaps of stone and mor- 
tar for their own glorification?” 



I shrugged. “I’m not ready to ac- 
cept that hypothesis. Explain, with 
your geologist’s wisdom, how those 
stupendous stone filigrees hang with- 
out collapsing under their own 
weight; more than two-thirds of the 
rock is chiseled away. They seem 
as fragile as sugar candy lace. What 
is their use?” 

“For the tensile strength of the 
rock I have no answer. But you 
evidently believe they are meant for 
more than ornament, don’t you?” 
“A hunch. Here’s another oddity: 
the interior walls do not parallel the 
outsides of the building. They show 
a slight S-curve. If you look down- 
ward through the stone filigree you 
get an impression of being suspend- 
ed inside a monstrous horn or bell.” 
George Pell, our semantics man 
strolled up the hill slope and asked, 
“May I join the company of gen- 
tlemen and scholars?” 

We made room for him and told 
him the gist of our discussion. I 
added, “I’m afraid Litzanov won’t 
like what I think I’m finding in 
those murals.” 

That brought Larsen out of deep 
thought. “How’s that?” 

“They have an eerie beauty, Jim. 
Their colors are transparent and ex- 
tremely rich. But wait until the di- 
rector knows that the subject matter 
of every one is music — those aliens 
listening or participating with trance- 
like ecstasy, sometimes portraits of 
musicians with zealous stares of 
prophets, and a few paintings em- 
phasizing orchestral instruments 
against a swirling background of 
color. He’s certain to throw me in 
the brig; I’ve bugged him enough

with my guitar and those drums 
yesterday.” 

George Pell grunted. “Hum-m-m! 
I’m intrigued. We’ve made progress 
into their written language, even 
though its basis is awfully foreign 
to Earthside concepts of linguistics. 
By coincidence you may have sup- 
plied us with a new key. A wild 
symbol had us stopped because in 
one context it apparently stood for 
diety, in others meaning like noise, 
or hidden things. Perhaps I should 
assume that their god and mysteries 
of his cult, and music with its creat- 
ing instruments are all synonymous.” 
1 handed him a paper. “Can you 
translate this? It’s an inscription I 
copied from a block of white rock 
in the center of the temple floor.” 
Pell studied it, then offered rne 
three choices: 

Enter (meekly? humbly?) the (first room?) in 
the house of God (music?) 

Tread (joyfully? willingly?) the (long journey? 
high read?) through the house of God 
Seek (with pleasure?) the (happiness? devine 
experience?) in the (sound? house?) of music 

A fter breakfast I tried to sneak 
out of camp with my guitar and, 
of course^ blundered into the direc- 
tor’s sight. He stood talking to Com- 
mander Jacobs, and his eyes fol- 
lowed me across the clearing. At 
every step I expected his nasal voice 
to call, “Doctor Maxwell, what are 
you doing with that contraption?” 
And I tried to formulate in my mind 
an answer to give him, feeling nak- 
edly foolish when I realised how 
silly I would sound saying, “I just 
wondered if that pretty stone fret- 
work up there in the temple ceiling 



could be some kind of resonatoiy 
and I aim to play a little tune for 

it.” 

But Litzanov had his mind on 
instructions to Jacobs, who was to 
take Explorer II off into space this 
morning for a week’s reconnaisance 
around the planetary system. I did 
not feel secure, though, until I 
reached the temple and stood with 
my guitar by the white slab to pluck 
one string at a time and listen for 
response from the grids of' scintillat- 
ing filigree above me. 

I didn’t know what 1 expected to 
hear — possibly an echo. However, 
arpeggios, chords, key changes all 
left them dead. Then suddenly, in 
the midst of discouragement, my 
ears caught the faintest whisper, as 
if a puff of wind had blown through 
the intertwining stone to leave them 
trembling. Binky stared nervously 
upwards, and I wondered if he had 
felt what I heard — or imagined. 

I concentrated then on the key 
which produced this effect, trying 
all its chords, major and minor m 
all inversions. Finally, as the minor 
sweetness of the seventh chord on 
the dominant rang out, a shudder 
slipped through the lacey stonework 
overhead. 

I repeated it with increasing vol- 
ume, and response was unmistakable, 
a thin tinkling that grew into an 
intermittant hum, as if the spiralling 
stone were loathe to arouse itself. 
Then the full sound of my chord 
took shape along the interconnecting 
tendrils, swelling steadily until the 
whole hall resounded like the inside 
of a bell. 

The chord still thrummed up there 

IF 



62 




after I stopped playing, singing with 
that aching need of the seventh 
chord to be resolved. Then Binky’s 
frightened stare and a sweep of 
chilled air behind me brought me 
whirling around. 

The stone slab, so solidly planted 
on that temple floor, was sinking 
•lowly, its noise drowned by haunt- 
ing clamor of music from the whorls 
of rock in the ceiling. Binky clutch- 
ed my arm. Together we watched 
the white block come to rest, slop- 
ing into a recess below. 

I don’t know what I expected to 
find underneath — certainly not 
the very ordinary-looking room 
which presented itself. And I don’t 
remember a single premonition that 
the slab might rise automatically to 
its original position, trapping us in 
the vault. Violet brightness filtered 
down through crystalline rock, light- 
ing that room, so Binky and I 
walked down the ramp. 

We half slid into a square room, 
carved out of the white rock that 
was the temple’s foundation. Not 
until Binky and I crossed to center 
did we discover the occupants sit- 
ting side by side, grinning death in 
their faces, three leather-hard mum- 
mies who had kept watch for end- 
less centuries, empty eye sockets 
directed toward a large plastic cube 
which had concealed them from me. 
In the subdued violet glow their 
countenances seemed sardonic, as if 
frozen at the moment of grim 
laughter. 

The multitudinous dead on this 
planet had left our party relatively 
unaffected; remoteness of centuries 



precluded personal identification 
with this alien charnel house. Now, 
in the dimness, facing these three, 
with the plaintive repetitions of my 
unresolved seventh chord crying 
among those fantastic grids, I sud- 
denly found those people were no 
longer strangers. I became vitally 
concerned over their destruction, and 
for the first time felt apprehensive 
for my own safety. 

Then — I was hearing music, a 
far-off horn call, sustained and mel- 
low. Gradually soft thrumming whis- 
pered under that persistent note, 
sound I had got from tympani in the 
museum. My eyes caught a jerk of 
Binky’s hand; I knew the source. 
A recording instrument filled that 
cube near the alien dead; Binky had 
moved a knob projecting from it. 
Even so, my ears located the tune 
as singing from the grids in the 
great hall above us. 

Woodwinds added dulcet voices 
to the insistent horn note, racing in 
barely audible chromatics around it; 
string sections came in to deepen the 
harmony, sweeping it toward the 
bass until all low-voiced instruments 
of the orchestra had joined in a 
tremendous chord, held seemingly 
for eternity. When my ears felt ready 
to burst under the thunderous weight 
of its crescendo a lilting song, thin 
sweetness hauntingly filled with 
strange intervals of the aliens, croon- 
ed in the grid, modulating an in- 
finite longing, non-human in sound, 
into a brilliant soaring surge of ex- 
treme joy. Here was a legacy from 
a dead orchestra on a dead world 
playing with an effect that seemed 
to possess physical life. 



THE PLANET PLAYER 



63 




Two hours I sat in that dim vault, 
enthralled by the hypnotic sonority 
of that symphony, until finally the 
knob Binky had pulled clicked back 
to its original position and no more 
sound fed into the stone grids. Yet, 
harmonies of the climactic phrases 
continued to roar along its maze 
of twisting crystal vines like turbu- 
lence through a thundeiftead. I be- 
came certain now that this temple 
had been constructed as a gigantic 
resonance chamber. The enormity 
of the idea left me shaken. 

After Binky and I walked through 
the amphitheatre’s lifeless audience 
and passed the circling arches, sound 
ceased to ring from the temple. In- 
stead, with some shock, I heard the 
complete symphony again, its melo- 
dies clear and unmuddied, winging 
toward me from far-off cliffs bor- 
dering both sides of our valley — 
rose white rocks lifting their voices 
to replay what had thundered from 
the crypt under that temple. 

V 

C amp was chaotic. Research team 
and maintenance crew faced the 
ridges like zombies. Larsen sailed 
in like a projectile on his skimmer 
to relate how white cliffs out where 
he conducted his geologic survey 
suddenly made music. 

I told them of the room under- 
neath the temple, but Jim insisted, 
“I heard no sound from the pyra- 
mid. Listen; the tunes are from the 
mountains.” 

“Nevertheless,” I repeated, “their 
origin is a four foot plastic cube 
under the temple. What we’re catch- 



ing now is some sort of echo effect.” 

Jim shook his head. “Not an 
echo.” 

The white cliffs continued to 
throw that entire symphonic marvel 
over the miles throughout much of 
the night. Like one suffering un- 
bearable pain Litzanov prowled un- 
til its cadences merged into the al- 
most-sound during bleak hours be- 
fore dawn. 

Squinting under sharpness of 
morning light he summoned me, his 
smile sour, his eyes haunted. “Life 
has concocted a devilish joke on 
me. Doctor Pell has found evidence 
that a significant part of this plan- 
et’s social structure was based upon 
a racket cult. I shall be working 
with you today.” 

The semanticist called from the 
breakfast table, “Its priesthood is 
involved in musical experiencing. 
Chuck, with rank or sacredness de- 
pendent upon ability to create great- 
er complexities of composition. 
Their language is still so damned 
vague that I’ve just skimmed the 
surface.” 

Jim Larsen joined us on the con- 
course. “I want to find out why I 
heard that music as if the mountain 
ledges originated the tunes.” 

“Do you have any theories?” I 
asked. 

He shrugged. “The crystalline 
structure of this planet’s rock must 
conduct sound with unbelievable ef- 
ficiency. Frequencies evidently trav- 
el through it thousands of times 
farther than through the atmosphere, 
probably several circuits of the globe 
before any major damping occurs, 
and every time they reach the sur- 



64 



IF 




face on one of those cliffs their vi- 
brations are transmitted again into 
the air.” 

“You are implying this whole 
planet is a transmitting and gigantic 
resonating device,” I said. 

“Any other explanation?” 

Litzanov muttered, “Not this side 
of hell.” 

Again I faced the huge slab with 
my guitar, posing for the inevitable 
motion picture sequence. Director 
Litzanov’s pantomime called atten- 
tion to importance of the filigreed 
stonework overhead, and instructed 
me to play. He awaited my music 
tensely, as if fearing blows from a 
whip. Involuntarily, hands covered 
his ears when my chord aroused 
reluctant stone tendrils and the rock 
started to sink. He was on the slab 
before it came to rest, in haste to 
run from twanging resonances bat- 
tering the main chamber. 

“That much hatred of music is 
neurotic,” I shouted to Jim Larsen, 
and saw him shrug. But I found it 
possible to pity Litzanov as I watch- 
ed his cringing anticipation of every 
booming accent. 

Binky headed for the plastic cube 
facing the mummified aliens, to pull 
the knob which touched off last 
evening’s concert. Litzanov cried, 
“Stop him!” I did, barely. 

T he director spoke thickly. “I am 
resigned to necessity for some 
of this devilish noise, but I hope 
we can undertake our study with as 
little of it as possible. Now, Doctor 
Pell, you formulated theories of a 
rigid priesthood caste, with possible 
deification of this organized racket 



people call music. We’ll follow your 
lead temporarily.” 

Pell answered, “If I’m right we 
should find a series of rooms, each 
with a barrier or sign permitting ac- 
cess only to specific ranks in the 
cult’s hierarchy.” 

I located an arched corridor which 
led us down to a lower level. There 
we discovered the second room. As 
Pel predicted, an inscription was 
carved over its arch. 

“These symbols are tricky,” Pell 
said, “but roughly it dedicates this 
crypt to someone who apparently 
brought his people to blessed com- 
munion with their god by creating 
more melodious music.” 

Although the compartment was 
four square, buttress-like sections 
jutted from its walls and pointed 
toward the same kind of plastic cube 
Binky and I had found above. Again 
three age-dried husks of the ill-fated 
race faced it. 

Uneasiness nagged as I listened to 
my seventh chord chiming through 
the grids of the colossal hall two 
levels above us. The peak of its 
sound had been reached, and the 
chord was now diminishing. Litza- 
nov was saying, “Doctor Maxwell, 
you will oblige me and our col- 
leagues by keeping that deaf-mute’s 
hands from this recording device. I 
should appreciate an opportunity to 
examine this chamber in silence.” 

I voiced my vague apprehensions. 
“We’ll need to pull that lever for 
our own safety, Doctor Litzanov.” 
He stared. “Why?” 

“That rock on the temple floor 
opened at the sound of music. I am 
sure it will trap us down here the 



THE PLANET PLAYER

moment my guitar chord ceases to 
vibrate through that grid.” 

“Then suppose you walk back up 
there periodically and renew the 
noise with your tinkling gadget. At 
least that won’t make us endure 
hours of punishment while this infer- 
nal music machine runs through its 
repertoire.” 

* I obeyed unhappily. Non-musical 
people do not understand the pecu- 
liar torture an unresolved chord in- 
flicts, especially that leading tone 
of the seventh. It sings with an un- 
earthly sweetness but must modulate 
quickly or it becomes an unending 
wail of loneliness and futility. 

‘Vfc7 r hen I returned to the tomb- 
* * like depths I found Larsen 
and George Pell in excited discussion 
before another carved inscription 
between two buttresses. Oblivious, 
Litzanov puttered with the three 
mummies, measuring and writing 
meticulously. 

“It’s another dedication,” grunted 
Pell. “Names another person whose 
music took his race farther toward 
divinity.” 

“Shouldn’t they mark an entrance 
into still another dungeon if your 
theory concerning the priesthood 
holds up?” I asked. I reached to 
feel the wall. Jim said, “That’s one 
gigantic crystal without a crack. 
Evidently this room is the end of 
the line.” 

“It can’t be,” George argued, “un- 
less my translations are all wrong.” 
And he sketched quickly a picture 
of the time-dusted dead he had 
gleaned from their records. 

Beauty had evidently been their 



creed — benevolence in their weath- 
er, graciousness in their living, splen- 
dor in the purple phosphorescence 
which streamed from their mountain 
tops and kept night away from them. 

“There should be four of these 
rooms,” Pell said, “dug at succes- 
sive levels deeper under the temple. 
Each vault apparently represented 
in time the accession of a new high 
priest and was created to preserve 
his inaugural composition, the result 
of a life-time of struggle to purify 
himself and lead his people into a 
state of oneness with their god — 
indicated in their documents by the 
same symbol which denoted harmon- 
ious sound. Evidently more crypts 
would have honeycombed the pyr- 
amid’s heart if catastrophe had not 
struck. 

“The latest written records talk of 
preparations to crown a new high 
priest, culminating in a planet-wide 
festival at which his inaugural sym- 
phonic composition would first be 
played. I found descriptions of dig- 
nitaries to attend its premiere in the 
amphitheatre, and instructions for 
all the world’s inhabitants to cease 
activity and listen when its divine 
harmonies sang to them from the 
ridges of crystalline stone. I found 
no accounts of the festival, nor of 
any events after it.” 

I said, “You are intimating that 
whatever tragedy blotted out life 
here struck on that evening of cele- 
bration.” 

George nodded. “Presumably.” 

T hey called Litzanov into the 
discussion. I’m afraid malice 
prompted a suggestion I made. “The 



66 



IF 




temple hall up there seemed to be 
the end of the line until I tried my 
guitar. Wouldn’t the next logical step 
require us to assume the music cube 
over there is triggered to open a 
hidden doorway into room number 
three?” 

The director stared malevolently 
at me. ‘‘We’ll try that twinging 
thing of yours. I am not willing to 
stand more racket than your guitar 
can make.” 

I protested. “A door would have 
been tuned to definite harmonic 
progressions recorded in that cube. 
I doubt we could ever find the com- 
bination on my guitar.” 

“Chuck is probably right,” Jim 
remarked. 

Litzanov moaned with exaspera- 
tion. “I suppose thoroughness de- 
mands that we pull the damned 
lever — since we’ll not be able to 
force a way to whatever might lie 
behind that wall until Explorer re- 
turns and we can get blasting equip- 
ment from her. Time’s too limited 
for that, whatever the cost in jangled 
nerves. Go ahead.” 

I moved the knob with undue 
alacrity. 

Music traced tentative paths 
across the delicate filigree and sang 
into the temple’s resonating bell 
shape, seeming innocuous. Richly 
harmonized melody in the string 
sections ranged through strange in- 
tervals of the alien’s scale, a simple 
song theme, a tiny bit sad, slightly 
lonely, a little lazy, but filled with 
subtle undercurrents of reflective 
joy hinting of visions beyond pre- 
sent moments. 

As the music swelled toward 



climactic measures other instru- 
ments caught the tune and* began its 
development. Then suddenly sound 
was in those triangular buttresses 
jutting from the walls of our crypt, 
giving depth to what issued from 
the grids far above the dungeons, 
enriching total effects of the sym- 
phony in the manner that addition 
of many more instruments to each 
section of an orchestra heightens its 
tonal impact. 

Binky reached for me. “You can’t 
hear it, can you, Binky?” I asked 
aloud, and realized what had dis- 
turbed him; I was feeling this music 
as well as taking its impressions 
through normal paths of the ears. 
Definite energy waves whipped 
nerves throughout my body to thous- 
ands of infinitesimal movements I 
could not localize, as if the sound 
had become a physical force battl- 
ing with light blows aimed from 
those buttresses. 

A glance at Larsen and Pell told 
me the same phenomenon affected 
them. 

I worried about Litzanov; he 
would be demoralized, hating this 
music rather than becoming caught 
up in it aesthetically. 

Then I forgot them, becoming in- 
creasingly disoriented with almost 
painful harmonies reaching and 
awakening my senses, one at a time. 
I heard more dimly specific melodies 
with their unbelievable arabesques 
racing upward until they swept be- 
yond the limits of my ears than sank 
into the narrow band of sound pos- 
sible for human senses to distinguish, 
then soared again, leaving me in an 
agonized straining to follow. 



THE PLANET PLAYER

I saw nothing but grayness and 
darker shadows now. Impres- 
sions of release from restraint of 
walls stole through me, as if I were 
delivered from my body, ecstatically 
free, afraid to see too deeply into 
darkness lurking just beyond the 
cocoon of music. A forest’s damp- 
ness touched me. I smelled pungence 
of pines and dank decay of fallen 
needles. I felt sharply chilled, as 
though the fogs of Carmel had 
swirled over me. I was tossed in the 
wild surf that pounded those beaches. 
I drifted like a gray mist among their 
stunted trees — and felt small and 
alone. 

No concept of time was left in 
me. Judging from the symphony re- 
leased yesterday by Binky’s fingers, 
we passed at least two hours in 
trance-like enslavement to esoteric 
harmonies. Without knowledge of 
when it came about, I found myself 
again recognizing colleagues in the 
room. Larsen and Pell stood dazed, 
staring down where a square of 
floor had sunk to reveal a ramp 
leading to a lower level in this pyr- 
amid. I realized only soaring after- 
tones of that hypnotic composition 
now muttered in those fantastic grids 
hanging in the tower. I remembered 
Litzanov and saw him on one knee, 
clawing at a buttress for support. 

The others came to help me ease 
him down. The man’s appearance 
frightened me. His face showed a 
bloodless gray, and he drew breath 
with labored gulps. Nevertheless he 
sat up after some moments and 
spoke, barely above a whisper. “This 
is hellish torture.” 

“We’ll do a quick survey of the 



next crypt below and let you rest 
here,’* suggested Jim. 

We called the medic over from 
the museum and left Litzanov with 
him, then filed down the ramp. A 
labyrinth enfolded us, alight witll 
violet-tinged brightness filtering 
through its convolutions. Instead of 
hollowing a conventional vault an- 
cient artisans had carved rock out 
to leave a replica of the titanic 
filigreed canopies which spanned 
the temple’s ceiling. Centered and 
joined to the twisting stone vines 
sat the familiar plastic cube and 
three time-embalmed custodians. 
More carved symbols above a slight 
concavity faced us from one side 
of the crypt. 

“That will be as you predicted. 
George,” Larsen muttered, “room 
number four.” 

“With maybe the greatest of all 
the symphonies recorded in its 
cube,” I added. 

“Music its audience never heard 
through,” Pell commented. 

I ntense exhilaration gripped me; 

tunes of the past hours sang in 
my head. Yet I felt cold, debilitated, 
as if recovering from fever. Even so, 
I saw with unnatural clarity, like the 
blind rediscovering a wonderous 
world. “I want to hear that sym- 
phony,” I announced. “We’ve got 
to go into that room.” 

Jim agreed. “It’s a rugged ex- 
perience to take on two such con- 
certs in succession, but I’m with 
you.” 

“Let’s persuade the director to go 
on back to camp first.” Pell’s voice 
was unsteady. “I think I would 



68 



IF 




follow him and leave the field to 
you fellows if I didn’t hope solu- 
tions to the puzzle of this dead 
world might lie in that vault. A day 
on the rack would have been less 
painful th^n what that music did to 

_. A ff 

me. 

We started to the ramp. Jim was 
saying, “There’s no doubt; each of 
these rooms has been dug deeper 
into the heart rock of this planet 
and modified, evidently with ad- 
vanced understanding of using the 
resonating characteristics of this 
planet. The whole globe definitely 
possesses hair-trigger sensitivity to 
vibration.” 

I broke in. “The strange almost- 
sound I hear constantly?” 

“Waves set up in the rock by 
wind currents and changes in at- 
mospheric temperature.” 

We met our director on the ramp, 
walking unsteadily down, using the 
medic’s arm for support. 

Larsen protested, “You’re in no 
condition to continue without a 
rest.” The medic muttered, “Hope 
you’re better at persuading than I 
was.” And Litzanov shook loose 
from the doctor like a wilful kid, 
repeating, “We’ll finish this job now. 
I don’t intend to stretch my endur- 
ance over any more days.” He head- 
ed for the recorder cube and its 
guardian mummies, deaf to argu- 
ment. The medic gave up. “I’ve giv- 
en him tranquilizers. Maybe that 
will carry him through.” 

Jim asked, “Was it his heart?” 
And the medic shook his head. 
“Looked like it at first, but I heard 
no indications of it. Exhaustion — 
hypertension, maybe.” 



In spite of illness Litzanov arrang- 
ed another picture before proceeds 
ing, pantomiming pointing out to us 
the cube, irridescent whorls of fret- 
work, indicating carved symbols be- 
traying the fourth entrance to be 
opened by final chords of music we 
intended to activate in this room. 

None of the director’s construc- 
tion of his public image was as 
crass as my description sounds. He 
simply contrived to be the center 
of any discovery, and made certain 
the scene was preserved for Earth 
viewing. Senior members of our re- 
se'-rch team accepted the situation, 
some because they loved their work 
more than lime-light, some because 
a seat by his throne insured a share 
of the gravy. His name weighed 
heavily with those who hired and 
fired on Earth and sat in high posts 
because they could find men like 
Litzanov, willing and skilled in man- 
ipulation of men’s destinies, to help 
inflate their balloons. The cynical 
question to ask it: are these titled 
few aware of creating this breed of 
learned leeches upon whose offal 
they feed, or is there such confusion 
in their administrative minds that 
they truly accept a notion that they 
are capable of standing high above 
the crowd without crawling up on 
the shoulders of others? 

VI 

L itzanov became physically small- 
er as he faced the moment 
when we must activate the music 
cube. He knew we held in our hands 
the most spectacular find in man’s 
history of exploration, and to have 



THE PLANET PLAYER 



69 




credit for it printed by his name in 
Who's Who and other vanity mirrors 
he had to make his investigation 
personally. To relinquish completion 
of its examination to someone else 
was to risk having the title and claim 
for the entire project upon a rival’s 
page of fame. And if Pell had not 
read the alien records rightly, and 
there happened to be a fifth — or 
sixth or seventh — room, each also 
must be entered by the sound-tor- 
tured director to preserve his image 
for posterity and his right to title 
of discovery. 

Fear clouded his eyes, but he 
bruskly nodded permission to pull 
the lever. 

We felt the initial tones rather 
than heard them, like the lowest 
pedal notes on a gigantic organ. 

I knew there was sound because my 
whole body responded to the lift and 
fall of long slow waves. I sensed 
tremendous amplification of the mu- 
sic, its energy sucking my breath as 
if I faced a hurricane. Pressure built 
up on my ear drums, bringing excru- 



ciating pain even after I covered the 
orifices with my palms. I felt vibra- 
tion through the flesh of my hands 
as they pressed against my ears, and 
a steadily increasing warmth as if 
a fever were growing in me. I knew 
there were extremely high frequen- 
cies pouring through me, how high 
I had no sensory equipment capable 
of telling. 

Then sound within the range of 
perception came into the composi- 
tion, harmony with timbre and re- 
sonance so piercing that it closed 
my throat, changed the heart beats 
at will, caused tears to flow against 
effort to gain control of emotional 
reflexes. This was something so far 
beyond the orchestral piece which 
had struck Litzanov down that I 
worried and tried to focus enough 
to see him. A shadowy impression 
of him prone on the floor was all 
I could catch, and all the attention 
I could spare him. 

Thunderous chords suddenly beat 
at me with the force of tornadic 
wind, slamming me against the cube.

IF 



And just as unexpectedly, ringing 
melody superceded and lifted me 
into wild ecstasy, higher and higher 
until I thought its insistent tune 
could tear me to bits. And as quick- 
ly, the music dropped me into hells 
where sound became demons with 
needle-sharp claws. I felt responses 
from areas of my body I had never 
been aware of; every individual atom 
oscillated in cumulative multiplica- 
tion of movement accompanied by 
the generation of unbearable heat. 
Blood was streaming from my nose. 
I clung to the plastic cube which 
had unleashed this fiendish torture, 
with no strength left. And paradoxi- 
cally, through the pain and fever I 
was flooded with singing tunes so 
compelling that I cried aloud and 
screamed with the emotional surge 
of their beauty. 

T hen suddenly I experienced 
the tearing strike of a heart 
pain; it ripped through my chest in 
nightmare spasms, like the crushing 
strides of Death. Destruction was 
here for all of us unless the music 
could be stopped — perhaps too late 
even now. I tried to concentrate, to 
hold consciousness and reach the 
knob. It was only a foot or two 
from my hand. Between increasing 
lightning thrusts of chest piin and 
irregular racing of heart beat that 
stopped my breath, I struggled to 
slide toward it, but I think only my 
fingers moved. 

In flashes of lucidity I had im- 
pressions of Binky rushing about 
the room, running to look into my 
face, fading into nothingness when 
pains slashed at me. Once I saw 



his hand on mine, but could not feel 
its touch, nor ask his help. Then 
redness blinded me, and I knew cap- 
illaries in my eyes had burst. And 
after that came darkness. 

It seemed to me that something 
had been tugging at me throughout 
all eternal time. A roughness moved 
under me in jerks. I could see dim- 
ly. I couldn’t hear. 

Fear of drawing breath followed, 
with automatically a frightened catch 
to keep it shallow, expecting pain 
to strike. Hurt did sit like a crushing 
weight upon my chest, but only a 
shadow of its remembered self. Then 
it was Binky’s face over me, recog- 
nizable, and mind and eyes cleared 
enough to see gem-like colors of 
the temple walls, and to realize he 
had probably dragged me up those 
ramps from the death crypts be- 
neath. But I could neither hear nor 
move. He disappeared, then gray- 
ness took me again. 

I have no memory of being trans- 
ported to camp. Explorer II returned 
next day from its investigation of 
the near planets, and we were all 
taken aboard. That part was dream- 
like. We had been many days in 
space before I could assimilate de- 
tails from Commander Jacobs. 

They think Binky dragged us all 
out of that hellish trap, one at a 
time. The music had struck those 
at camp also, but not so lethally. 
Coming from the white cliffs it had 
evidently lost enough of its intens- 
ity during transit through under- 
ground rock. However, many hours 
had elapsed before anyone had 
strength to hunt for us at the tem- 
ple. 



THE PLANET PLAYER

T hey found me dazed and inco- 
herent. Pell, Litzanov, and the 
medic were dead. Jim Larsen is still 
in a state of shock, hardly routing 
when^he is moved, but expected io 
recover. Binky apparently had not 
been affected beyond extreme ner- 
vousness and unprediptably irrational 
actions since. And sometimes, as I 
sit up in my hospital bed dictating 
this report, I think he hears sounds 
from my mouth, dimly, and I won- 
der if the strength of that demon 
music found a way into dormant 
nerves of his ears and stirred them 
to half life. 

And between the surges of thank- 
fulness that Fate placed Binky under 
my care on Explorer II, I wonder 
about that planet, with its beautiful 
empurpled ghost aura, so many 
years across black space, carrying 
its millions of dead ceaselessly in 
orbit around a blue-white sun which 
cannot warm them back to life. I 
wonder that the excess of anything, 
even beauty, can become the execu- 
tioner of its seeker. 



And I am caught in its net. The 
planet’s music sings through my in- 
ner ear the moment my mind is 
released from necessity to deal with 
routines. Irresistible compulsions will 
drive me to study it, for it is cojii* 
position so grand that a Beethoven 
of Earth seems nothing but a' tink- 
ling contriver of popular tunes. I 
shiver at once with apprehensions 
and the desire to hear that sym- 
phony we did not play, imprisoned 
in the fourth plastic cube, the glory 
of sound which killed its world. 

There will be another expedition 
to finish studies we left undone 
there, for man cannot bear not to 
know. I want to be a part of it. 
During the restless hours which fill 
my nights I think in circles — surely 
a way can be found to filter that 
sound so I can listen in safety, or 
shut it out if necessary. Perhaps this 
is a death wish, but, God help me, 
I will not rest until I’ve tried to hear 
it, for the memory of that alien mu- 
sic is a demon of exquisite beauty, 
and I am hag-ridden. END

IF 




IF ® Short Story 




by WALT & LEIGH RICHMOND 



Ever speculate why you aren't 
smarter than you are? Here's 
why — and what to do about it! 



M ’Lord received the message on 
Moonbase One with a feeling 
of complete dismay. Why, this spe- 
cies was 50,000 to 100,000 of 
their years from the type of devel- 
opment Galactic Central was asking 
for! 

Yet the message was specific. The 
Korm’aans according to present 
calculations by Computer Center, 
would begin a sweep through this 
spiral arm of. the Galaxy, and Ga- 
lactic Central would need a devel- 
oped people as an ally. 

Get them into condition to receive 
Galactics without fear in 200 of 
their years? Capable of offering their 
resources freely? Capable of assis- 
tant labor? Capable of being an ally, 
however weak? 

Forced stimulation was one thing, 
and he’d watched it tried. It could 



work, though normally it simply 
killed off the stimulated species. 

“The greater good for all the 
peoples of the Galaxy demands that 
we take a chance on sacrificing this 
species,” the message added, a sop to 
his conscience, since the message 
was an order, not a request. “We 
will then have either an ally of a 
weak but unhampering variety, or a 
planet of the proper Z character- 
istics returned to the primitive form 
from which we can operate unham- 
pered by a developing and possibly 
resentful native intelligence.” 

The methods were left to him. By 
all the rampletes of knowledge of all 
Computer Center! What stimulus 
could you apply to a species barely 
into their iron age to get them to an 
intelligence level where they could 
even stay out from underfoot in a 



73 




mere 200 years? Especially when 
each member of that species re- 
quired a full one-tenth of that time 
to develop to the stage of species- 
maturity; and the useful life-span of 
individual members was a possible 
30 of those years? 

Obviously, it would have to be a 
nerve-stimulus. And just as obviously 
it would have to be broadcast to 
affect the entire species. 

Electronic, of course. But they 
weren’t even capable of electricity 
yet, much less electronics. That, in 
the normal sequence-pattern that 
their development showed, would be 
at least 5,000 of their years in their 
future. And you couldn’t introduce 
a broadcast electronic stimulus trom 
within the culture immediately. Even 
with only 200 years available. That 
would be sure death, though Ga- 
lactic Central did say they’d as soon 
have the planet returned to the primi- 
tive . 

N o. The stimulus would have to 
be confined to wires so that 
it could spread slowly, and so that 
it would act as a stimulus only when 
a member of the species was within 
a few miles of the wires. Too abrupt 
an introduction of a stimulus would 
be surely fatal, and Central had 
specified an attempt to develop these 
creatures. 

These sheep. And I, their shep- 
herd, must take a chance on ruining 
the flock that shows such promise; 
that I have spent my career in 
nurturing! He knew a moment’s 
sadness before he set himself to the 
task at hand. 

Very well. The best stimulus, of 



course, was the 60 cycle alternating 
current; and it must be introduced 
in such a way that it would grow 
through the culture, until finally 
each member of the species — at 
least the major groups — were sub- 
ject to the nerve-impact most of the 
time. But also in such a way that it 
was possible to escape from it. This 
would give the most aware a chance 
to withdraw occasionally and give 
their nerves a rest. 

You couldn’t introduce the stim- 
ulus from within directly as AC 
current at 60 cycles. Best to intro- 
duce the battery and let them play 
with direct current for a matter 
of — say 50 to 75 of their years. 
There would be no stimulation 
there, and Galactic Central might 
consider the time wasted, but you 
had to give a species time to play 
with and prepare for the type of 
battering ram that was inherent in 
being subjected to a constant 60 
cycle nerve-system jokingly playing 
upon them whenever they were 
within appreciable distance of wires 
carrying the frequency, if you plan- 
ned to see that those wires webbed 
the culture almost inescapably. 

With a sound that might have 
been translated as a sigh, M’Lord 
summoned his teslars. 

T he full 75-year interval since 
the introduction of the battery 
on Alterra had passed, and M’Lord 
realized with some disquiet that he 
now had no further excuse for de- 
laying the introduction of alternating 
current. 

The species had done well; had 
taken the new ‘toy’ handed them so 



74 



IF 




unobtrusively, and made it their very 
own. They had examined its possi- 
bilities with, actually, more keenness 
than even he, who had devoted his 
entire working period to their care, 
had expected. And just the intro- 
duction of the battery itself must 
have had a stimulating affect on the 
creature — or perhaps his teslars 
had dropped a few unauthorized 
hints — for still on his own, the 
creature had jumped from the iron 
age to steam, smelting, telegraphy 
— Really remarkable! 

M’Lord was proud of the Alter- 
rans. 

Yet he was probably to be the 
instrument of their destruction, he 
knew. Galactic Central was getting 
far too impatient for him to dally 
longer. The stimulus itself must be 
applied. And under that stimulus, the 
nervous systems of Alterrans would 
either respond with a surge that 
would take them far beyond their 
ability to cope with themselves; or 
those nervous systems would wither 
completely, leaving the Alterran an 
animal subject to his environment. 
If that occurred, he would be shortly 
wiped out, for in developing his 
ability to alter his environment to 
his. needs, the creature had sacri- 
ficed his ability to survive as an 
animal. 

However, the computers still ex- 
trapolated from Korm’aan strategy 
the probability of a move into this 
spiral arm, and the greater good . 

M’Lord summoned his chief tes- 
lar. 

This job must be handled deli- 
cately and the chief teslar would 
undertake it himself. 



A quarter century more was gone 
on Alterra, and stih the neces- 
sary alternating current had been 
introduced only as a potential. The 
potential was strong. The ground 
work had been well laid. But the 
first of the two centuries was passed, 
and the Alterran was still within his 
normal framework — slightly alter- 
ed; slightly advanced; but still essen- 
tially the same creature, with no 
potential of the necessary drastic 
change. And with these slow-but- 
surer methods, the overall webbing 
of this culture with the wire that 
would carry the drastically-effective 
60 cycle alternating current wouldn’t 
be accomplished for another quarter 
century! 

M’Lord had reason to worry. The 
species might be his charge, but 
Central was beginning to briilg pres- 
sure, and the Galaxy was Central’s 
charge. 

When the signal interrupted M’- 
Lord he brushed the communicator 
with an unusually brusk come-in 
response. 

“Chief teslar reporting, sir.” 
M’Lord visuated his chief. Re- 
markable how the make-up fitted. 
“Even I wouldn’t know you from an 
Alterran,” he grumphed. 

“Sir, the Alterrans themselves 
have barely noted even my pres- 
ence,” his teslar communicated 
proudly. “I could not avoid being 
noted to a slight extent, or being 
credited with some developments. 
But only the brightest of this species 
even remembers my presence.” 
“You’ve done a careful job, teslar, 
but a remarkably slow one,” M’Lord 
causticked. “So slow that it will be a 



M'LORD IS THE SHEPHERD 



75 




predictable 25 of their years before 
results begin to show.” 

“Sir. May I be allowed free say- 
ing?” 

“Speak.” 

“We have miscomputed them in 
including too large a resistance-to- 
development factor, sir. They are 
self-stimulating to a degree I had 
not thought possible. We have noted 
their violent reactions against prog- 
ress, and the force with which 
individuals with new ideas have been 
put down, and developments refuted. 
But we have failed to note equally 
the force with which those new ideas 
and developments are put up. As 
they say on Alterra, it takes two 
to make a battle. 

“Again, we have noted the nega- 
tive resistance factors that culminate 
in wars; but have failed to note the 
equally strong positive factors that 
cause them. And while we’ve 
watched the wars, we’ve failed to 
notice that individual arguments and 
group arguments are almost a way 
of life with this species! They argue. 
How they argue! Self-generated ar- 
guments at the individual, the group, 
and the cultural-center level, a con- 
stant . Because of this, our applied 
stimulus might work out as a release 
on their self-stimulus, both positive 
and negative, and act as an addition 
rather than as a basic! So much so 
that I — Sir, complete free saying 
and no retribution?” 

M ’Lord visuated the teslar fierce- 
ly. “You’re bordering on ulti- 
mate insubordination already! But 
yes, free saying and no retribution.” 
“Sir, I altered the concept to a 



degree. I — as the Alterrans would 
say it — hedged your bets. I have 
arranged that one major portion of 
their culture only, the strongest, shall 
get the full 60-cycle stimulus. In the 
remainder of their centers I have 
introduced the probability of the far 
lesser stimulus of 50 cycles.” 

“You dared!” 

“Sir, we have not sampled their 
brain recordings for quite a period, 
and the patterns have advanced. The 
60-cycle may be too strong, even for 
the period of time allowed, 75 of 
their years under stimulus; at least 
50 of their years under a complete 
webbing of the carrying wire.” 
M’Lord leaned back. His own 
sympathies were with this species, 
although it was a weakness he could 
not admit. Yet, perhaps . 

“No retribution,” he said, “for 
altering the plan. And it is possible 
that you have introduced a better 
potential. However . however, 
if the course of events does not 
justify ...” 

“Yes, M’Lord.” 

But even his chief teslar’s re- 
estimate proved to have been made 
with too large a negative factor. 

Within ten Alterran years a sket- 
chy, initial wire webbing was in 
place in most of the planet’s major 
centers, and the effects were as- 
toundingly immediate. Within 20 
Alterran years there was little of the 
culture that was not heavily webbed, 
and it was glaringly apparent that 
there was no danger whatsoever that 
the creatures’ nervous systems would 
succumb to the impact. Not only 
the 60-cycle subjects, but even those 
subjected only to 50-cycle stimula- 



76 



IF 




tion were now reacting with impos- 
sible leaps in technologies, analyses, 
and computational abilities. The life 
span of the individual to as much 
as a normal 65 to 75 years; while 
the maturity span, formerly an 
optimum 30 exclusive of senility, 
now included an average 50 of their 
years. 

The effects were so nearly im- 
mediate and so completely unpre- 
dicted that recordings were rushed 
regularly by special transport to the 
computer at Galactic Central, which 
began altering its entire series of 
time-potential-probability sequences 
to include the new time-potentials 
now being demonstrated. Galactic 
Central sent special observer crews. 

Y et the third decade following 
the initial introduction of the 
potential stimulus had nearly passed 
before the final factor fell into 
place that required reclassification of 
the species. 

Unemotionally, the computer re- 
moved Alterrans from the classifi- 
cation: “Sheep; to be coddled for 
potential slave-service to the Galac- 
tic peoples;” to the classification: 
“Predator.” 

Almost as the reclassification was 
made, a command directive went by 
emergency beam to Moonbase One. 

“Akerran development must be 
reversed immediately,” the directive 
read. “Apply stupidifiers. These must 
be introduced at once. If possible, 
impose from within. If necessary, 
emergency action may be taken and 
stupidifiers imposed from without. 
This species is a greater hazard than 
Korm’aan. No time can be wasted.” 



M’Lord acted at once. Ultra-high- 
frequency radiation on a broadcast 
basis was indicated. Immediately. 
But, yes, it could be introduced from 
within with no time wasted. Low 
frequency broadcasts had already 
been developed by the species as an 
entertainment medium; and a war 
was making on the planet, so that 
a means of detecting enemy craft 
with high-frequency-radiation bom- 
bardment, which would hit the crea- 
tures as well as the targets, was a 
natural. 

The low frequency, long wave 
length entertainment broadcasts had 
had little if any effect on the nervous 
systems of the Alterrans, although 
the waves of radiation passed 
through their bodies as consistently 
as they did through the instruments 
built to receive them. Those long, 
looping wavelengths were far too 
large to be, at any point, contained 
within the body, and neither were 
they attuned to the body’s own fre- 
quencies. Therefore they left no in- 
put signal with the body’s nerve 
systems. 

Quite the contrary would be true 
of the ultra-high-frequency, ultra- 
short-wave-radar broadcasts as they 
filled the atmosphere with their 
signals. These wave lengths were 
short enough that each wave would 
be contained in microsecond inter- 
vals, complete within the nervous 
system; and whether or not they 
attuned the bodies own systems, they 
would leave an impulse . on the 
nerves — an impulse towards un- 
specified action, so that the nerves 
would tense of action, and be unable 
to direct the tension and so relieve 



M'LORD IS THE SHEPHERD 



77 




It. Again and again and again the 
ghost impulses would bombard the 
nervous systems, and the systems 
would alert. Alert — tensions — no 
translation; alert — tension — no 
translation — and no relief. Nervous 
breakdown was inevitable. Nervous 
breakdown and complete myasthe- 
nia. 

R adar was introduced within less 
than one-half an Alterran year, 
on a formula his teslar had left 
sleeping as a precaution. The effects 
were, again, immediate, but the de- 
velopment failed to slow. 

Within two years it was apparent 
that radar would not be sufficient. 
The radar bombardment was con- 
stant; the myasthenia general 
throughout the species; but Alterran 
development barely relaxed its head- 
long pace, much less reversed. 

“They should be worn out — com- 
pletely frazzled — on the way to 
primitive conditions — in a state of 
breakdown as a species! There’s a 
proportion of breakdown, but only 
a proportion — and they’re carrying 
that proportion and still heading into 
space!” M’Lord’s chief teslar was 
as drawn and whorled as his master. 

“Apply hypnosis.” M’Lord’s com- 
munication was firm with a convic- 
tion and an authority he no longer 
felt. 

“Hypnosis, sir, requires the cen- 
tering of each individual’s attention. 
That is an individualized process, 
sir.” 

“So?” 

“So it cannot be imposed from 
without! And there is no time to 
develop it from within the culture!” 



“Radar was developed by this 
species in time-elements measure- 
able in increments of their years.” 

“But this must be individualized, 
so that each member of the species 
is subjected ...” 

“These creatures are on their way 
into space, in a condition of destruc- 
tive-compulsion unknown in the Gal- 
axy. You will find a method!” 

“Perhaps — ” The chief teslar was 
hesitant. “Perhaps, then, a major 
hypnotic is justified? A complete 
stupidifier? One that centers each 
individual’s attention on a pattern 
of lights flickering at a pulse fre- 
quency near enough that of a main 
brave wave frequency to capture and 
alter the brain wave rhythm? But 
that would be catastrophic, sir!” 

His master grouched angrily, as 
much distressed as the teslar. “It 
must be so!” he affirmated. 

The teslar bowed his head. “I 
grieve with you, sir, if you will so 
permit me.” Then he unslouched 
and communicated firmly. “We will 
introduce an instrument for screen- 
ing transmitted entertainment in the 
home. It can be set to a flicker-rate 
near one of the creature’s main 
brain-cycle patterns so that, watch- 
ing it, he will unconsciously match 
the brain cycle to the flicker-rate 
and will become hypnotized. This 
will be easy, sir, in the areas where 
we have introduced 60-cycle electric 
currents. This cycle frequency is 
nearly a divisive of their major brain 
pattern. However, in the 50-cycle 
areas — well, the hypnotic effect 
will not necessarily be as great, but 
the stimulation here has not been as 
great either, and the stupidifying 



78 



IF 




effect of the applied hypnotic need 
not be as strong.” 

T he initial development of opta- 
rad required a period of sev- 
eral Alterran years, while Galactic 
Central altered its plans for con- 
taining the spiral arm of the Galaxy 
from defense against the Korm’aan 
to defense against the new species. 
Plans were sufficiently detailed to 
include methods for enlisting the 
Korm’aan in common cause against 
the Alterrans. 

Then optarad was in production, 
the screen-frequency of its light- 
pulse set at a rhythm very near the 
dominant brain-wave of the species. 

The introduction was highly suc- 
cessful. Within a decade the daily 
habit of attention-centering on the 
instrument was nearly as broadly 
spread as the use of electricity. 

The hypnotic stupidifier was at 
work, aided and abetted by the 
nerve-frazzling broadcast of the 
ultra-high-frequency radar signals. 

Relaxing for the first time in 157 
Alterran years, M’Lord waited for 
the commendation he felt sure would 
be forthcoming from Galactic Cen- 
ter. Radar had had around 20 Al- 
terran years to take effect; the new 
optarad hypnotic frequencies had 
been played into the eyes of a vast 
majority of the leading Alterran 
creatures for five or more of those 
years. 

“My poor sheep,” he thought re- 
gretfully to himself. “We turned you 
into predators, and must now put 



you to sleep. Yet — perhaps I may 
find a way that you be allowed to 
safely graze; content and peaceful 
at last.” 

The entry-port signal blinked, and 
M’Lord brushed the ‘come-in’ re- 
sponse with a sigh. 

“Chief teslar reporting, sir.” 

M’Lord visuated his chief, who 
seemed rather excited. “Well?” he 
grumphed. 

“Sir, the hypnosis is not sufficient. 
Sir, it is numbing their brain cen- 
ters — but the brain capacity seems 
to be far larger than was indicated 
by the small portion they were 
using. As one area of each brain 
weakens, the stronger of the crea- 
tures adapt by putting another un- 
used portion of brain into service 
to replace it. At the same time the 
weaker are reduced to apathy so 
that they are no longer in the way. 
These creatures, sir, are heading into 
space in spite of the hypnosis! Sir, 
our predictions fail by a factor 
of ... ” 

The communicator blinked the 
red emergency, and M’Lord watched 
his own nerve ends flare as he 
pushed the “here; begin” button. Hie 
communication spat out: 

“All plans whorled. Computer 
predicts these beings will have Ga- 
lactic Mastership within approxi- 
mately 500 Galactic years. The 
Korm’aan have made common cause 
with us, and you now serve as 
ambassador to both. Entreat for us 
free living and no retribution ...”

A s Retief paid off his canal 
barge and stepped up on the 
jetty, Second Secretary Magnan 
pushed his way through the throng 
at the wharf entrance to the Royal 
Enclosure, his narrow face flushed 
with exertion. “There you are!” he 
cried. “I’ve been searching every-

be furious!” 



“What’s that on your head?" Re- 
tief eyed a half-inflated bladder of 
a sour yellow color which lolled 
over Magnan’s left ear. 

Magnan rolled an eye up at the 
vari-colored cluster which bobbed 
with each movement, draggled 
feathers wagging and lengths of 
dirty string swaying, the entire as- 
sembly secure under his chin by a 
stained pink ribbon. 

“Why, that’s my ceremonial Rock-

“Oh oh; there he goes with the

through the crowd, made his way 
to the wide doorless entry to a

footing, Retief!” he yelped. “When 
you’re around me, stamp your feet 
when you walk!” 

“Mr. Ambassador, I’d like — ” 
Splitwhistle raised a small, plump- 
fingered hand. “Spare me a cata- 
logue of your likes and dislikes, Mr. 
Retief! The ceremony is about to 
begin.” He turned to include a 
wider audience. “Gentlemen, I trust 
you all observed my handling of 
protocol since our arrival here on 
Rockamorra this morning. Scarcely 
six hours, and we’re about to be- 
come the first diplomatic mission 
ever to be accredited to this world! 
A world, I need not remind you, 
with a reputation for vigorous com- 
mercial activity and hostility to 
diplomats; and yet I — ” 

“Before this goes any farther, Mr. 
Ambassador — ” Retief cut in, “I 
think — ” 

“May I remind you, sir!” Split- 
whistle shrilled. “/ am talking! About 
a subject of vast importance, namely 
myself! Er, my contribution, that is, 
to diplomatic history.” 

A pair of robed Rockamorrans 
bustled up, waving elaborate cande- 
labra which emitted a pungent odor 
and clouds of red and green smoke. 
They struck poses before Split- 
whistle, intoned resonant ritual 
phrases in sonorous tones, then 
stepped back. One pointed a thin, 
multi-jointed webbed digit at Retief, 
made a sound like a saw-blade drag- 
ged across a base viol string. 

“Where’s your headdress, Retief?” 
Splitwhistle hissed. 

“I don’t have one. What I wanted 
to tell you — ” 

“Get one instantly! And take your 

81 




place in my entourage!” The Am- 
bassador moved off at the heels of 
the local officials. Magnan, rushing 
up at that moment, waved the 
bladders excitedly. 

“Don’t bother inflating it, just get 
it on!” 

“Never mind that,” Retief said. 
“I won’t be needing it.” 

“What do you mean? We all have 
to wear them.” 

“Not me. I won’t be taking part 
in the ceremony; and I advise — ” 

“Crass insubordination!” Magnan 
gasped, and rushed off in Split- 
whistle’s wake as large bouncers 
moved in to bar Retief’s path. 

I t was a colorful ceremony, in- 
volving a vigorous symbolic 
beating of the diplomats with real 
laths, immersion in a pond which, 
to judge from Magnan’s nose when 
he surfaced, was considerably chil- 
lier than the bracing morning air, 
and finishing off with a brisk run 
around the compound — ten laps — 
during which the panting Terrans 
were spurred to creditable efforts by 
quirt-wielding native dignitaries 
loping along behind them. Retief, 
observing the activities from a po- 
sition among the curious at the 
sidelines, won ten credits in local 
currency on Splitwhistle, whose 
form he had correctly judged su- 
perior to that of his staff. 

Amid a tolling of deep-toned 
gongs, the Rockamorran officials 
herded the wheezing Terrans to- 
gether and read off a long speech 
from a scroll. Then a small local 
stepped forward, bearing a six-foot 
sword on a purple velvet cushion 
82 



lettered MOTHER — a Terran im- 
port, Retief noted. 

A tall Rockamorran in mauve 
and puce vestments strode up to 
Splitwhistle and picked up the 
sword. The Ambassador backed a 
step, said, “Look here, my good 
man — ” and was prodded back into 
line. The sword-handler solemnly 
hung a beaded baldric over the 
stout diplomat’s shoulderless frame 
and attached the scabbard to it. 

Then the locals fell silent, staring 
at Splitwhistle expectantly. 

“Magnan, you’re protocol officer. 
What am I supposed to do now?” 
the Ambassador muttered from the 
corner of his mouth. 

“Why, I’d suggest that Your Ex- 
cellency just sort of, ah, bow and 
then we all turn and leave, before 
they think up any more tortures.” 

“All right, men: all together,” 

Mr. Splitwhistle whispered hoarsely. 
“About face.” 

Magnan yelped as the two-yard 
long cutlass connected solidly with 
his shin as the group turned; then 
they strode away, the Ambassador 
in the lead, drawn up to his full 
five feet, with the sword cutting a 
trail in the dust behind him. There 
was a happy mutter from the locals, 
then a swelling shout of joy; eager 
hands clapped the Terrans on the 
back, offered them sulphurette dope- 
sticks, proffered flasks of green 
liquid as the ceremony broke up into 
mutual rejoicing. 

Retief made his way through the* 
press, intercepted Splitwhistle as he 
pushed through. 

“Well, Retief!” the Ambassador 
barked. “Absented yourself from the

proceedings, 1 noted! Having sulked 
in your quarters during the voyage 
out, you now boycott official func- 
tions! I’ll see you in my office as 
soon as I’ve seen to the safe-keeping 
of this handsome ceremonial weap- 
on I’ve been awarded.” 

“That’s what I wanted to tell you, 
Mr. Ambassador. It’s not ceremo- 
nial. You’re expected to use it.” 

“What? Me use this?” Splitwhistle 
smiled sourly. “1 shall hang it on 
the wall as a symbol — ” 

“Possibly later, sir,” Retief cut in. 
“Today you have a job to do with 
it.” 

“A job?” 

“I think you misunderstand the 
nature of the ceremony. The Rocka- 
morrans don’t know anything about 
diplomacy. They thought you came 
here to help them — ” 

“As indeed we did,” Splitwhistle 
snorted. “Now if you’ll stand 
aside — ” 

“ — so they’re expecting you to 
make good on your promise. Now.” 

“Promise? What promise?” Split- 
whistle asked. 

“That’s what the ceremony was 
all about. The Rockamorrans are 
in trouble, but you’ve promised to 
get them out of it.” 

“I’ve already planned an economic 
survey — ” 

“That won’t do the job, Mr. 
Ambassador. There’s a ninty foot 
dinosaur named Crunderthush loose 
in the area.” 

“Dinosaur?” Splitwhistle’s voice 
rose to a squeak. 

Retief nodded. “And you’ve just 
sworn to kill him before sundown 
tomorrow.”

4 4T ook here, Retief,” First Sec- 
■1— ' retary Whaffle said into the 
silence. “How is it you appear to 
understand the proceedings, con- 
ducted as they were in the barbaric 
local patois?” 

“I didn’t. They talked too fast. 
But I picked up a smattering of 
the language studying tapes on the 
way out, and I had a nice chat 
with the boatman.” 

“I dispatched you to arrange for 
lodging and servants, not natter 
with low-caste locals!” Splitwhistle 
chirped. 

“I had to do a little nattering in 
order to rent rooms. The locals 
don’t understand sign language — ” 
“Impertinence, Mr. Retief? You 
may consider yourself under suspen- 
sion!” 

A group of Rockamorran officials 
had gathered, a column of pikemen 
behind them, stolid and menacing 
in green scaled breast-plates and 
greaves. 

“Ah — before you confine your- 
self to quarters,” Splitwhistle added, 
“just tell these chaps we won’t be 
available for monster-killing. How- 
ever, I think I can promise them a 
nice little Information Service Li- 
brary, well stocked with the latest 
CDT pamphlets — ” 

One of the Rockamorrans stepped 
forward, ducked his head, addressed 
the Ambassador: 

“Honorable sir, I have pleasure of 
to be Haccop, interpretator of Terry 
mouth-noise learn from plenty Jap- 
anee, Dutch, Indian, and Hebrew 
Terry trader. We had nice chin-chin 

IF 




via telescreen before you-chap hit 
beach.” 

“Ah, to be sure! Pity you weren’t 
standing by during the ceremony. 
Now we’ll get to the bottom of this 
nonsense!” Split whistle shot Retief a 
withering look. “I have heard ... ah 
. rumors, to the affect that there’s 
some sort of, ha ha, dinosaur roam- 
ing the countryside — ” 

“Yes, yes, excellent sir! Damn 
decent you-chap come along us.” 

Splitwhistle frowned. “Perhaps I’d 
better clarify our position, just in 
case there was any confusion in 
translation. I am, of course, ac- 
credited as Corps Diplomatique 
Terrestrienne Ambassador Extraor- 
dinary and Minister Plenipotentiary 
to your government, with full au- 
thority to—” 

“Hukk! With title like that, how 
can you miss?” Haccop exulted. 
“You want few our boys along for 
pick up pieces? Or you handle 
Crunderthush alone, catch more 
glory?” 

“Here, I’m a diplomat! My offer 
was to assist your poor backward 
nation!” 

“Sure. Swell gesture of interplane- 
tary chumship.” 

“Just a moment!” Splitwhistle 
thrust out his lower lip, pointing a 
finger heavenward. 

“I deal in words and paper, sir, 
not deeds! That is, I am empowered 
to promise you anything I deem 
appropriate, but the actual perform- 
ance is up to lesser persons.” 

Haccop arranged his wide fea- 
tures in what was obviously a frown. 
“Around this end galaxy, chum say, 
chum do.” 

GIANT KILLER 



“Surely. And 1*11 speak to Sector 
HQ early next month when my 
vessel returns; 1 imagine something 
can be arranged.” 

“Crunderthush on rampage nowl 
No catchem wait next month! 
You owner genuine Japanese-made 
sword; you use!” 

S plitwhistle’s chins quivered. “Sir! 

You forget yourself! 1 am the 
Terrestrial Ambassador, not a con- 
founded exterminator service!” 
“You-chap violate Rockamorran 
tradition number six-oh-two, passed 
two hours ago by Council of Honor- 
able Dotards!” 

Splitwhistle unbuckled the sword, 
tossed it aside. Retief lunged, caught 
it before it hit the dirt, handed it 
to Haccop. Arms folded, the Am- 
bassador glared at the Rockamor- 
ran. 

“Let me state unequivocally, at 
once, that I have no intention of 
attacking a dinosaur!” 

Haccop’s face fell — an effect 
like a mud-pack slipping. “Is final 
decision?” 

“Indeed so, sir!” 

The Rockamorran turned, spoke 
to the pikemen in glottal Rocka- 
morran; they closed in, nudged 
Splitwhistle and the four diplomats 
who had participated in the oath- 
taking ceremony. 

“Here, what’s going on?” the Am- 
bassador yelped. 

“It seems they’re taking you away 
to the local lockup, sir,” Retief said. 

“They can’t do this to me! And 
why aren’t you included?” 

“1 didn’t take the oath.” 
“You-chap move along,” Haccop 

85 




said. “Rockamorran got no time be 
patience with oath-busters.” 

“H-how long will we be incar- 
cerated?” Whaffle asked. 

“One day,” Haccop said. 

“Well, that’s not too bad. Your 
Excellency,” Magnan pointed out. 
“We can spend the time figuring out 
an alibi — I mean, of course, com- 
posing a dispatch to Sector Head- 
quarters explaining how this is really 
a sort of diplomatic victory, in 
reverse — ” 

“Tomorrow, my good man,” 
Splitwhistle barked at Haccop, “I can 
assure you 1 shall take drastic steps.” 
“Have honor of to doubt that, 
faithless one,” Haccop said. “Pretty 
neat trick take steps with head off.” 

Ill 

S plitwhistle glared at Retief through 
the barred windows of his cell. 
“I hold you fully responsible, sir, 
for not warning me of this barbaric 
custom! I trust you’ve established 
communication with the Corps 
Transport and ordered their return?” 
“I’m afraid not. The local trans- 
mitter doesn’t have the range.” 

“Are you out of your mind? That 
means ... ” Splitwhistle sagged 
against the bars. “Retief,” he whis- 
pered. “.They’ll lop our heads off.” 
A squad of Rockamorran pikemen 
rounded a corner, marched up to 
the Terrans’ cell. 

“Well, you-chap ready to take 
part in execution?” 

“Just a minute,” Retief said. 
“They promised to kill Crunder- 
thush by sundown tomorrow. That’s 
still a full day away.” 

86 



“True. But always have head- 
cutting after lunch; pack in better 
house that way, at one credit per 
ticket.” 

Retief shook his head. “Highly 
illegal procedure. Killing off a few 
diplomats is perfectly understand- 
able, but it has to be done in ac- 
cordance with protocol or you’ll 
have a squadron of Peace Enforcers 
in here revising Rockamorran tra- 
ditions before you can say ‘inter- 
ference with internal affairs’.” 
“Hmmm. You might have a poin£ 
there. Okay, we hold off until to- 
morrow night. Have torch-light ex- 
ecution, very colorful.” 

“Retief!” Magnan gasped, pushing 
up against the bars beside Split- 
whistle. “Isn’t there some way to 
prevent this ghastly miscarriage of 
justice?” 

“Only way, you -chap change 
mind, kill Crunderthush,” Haccop 
said cheerfully. 

Retief looked thoughtful. “Do the 
Ambassador and these other gentle- 
men have to do the job personally?” 
“Posilutely! Can’t have every Tom, 
George and Meyer getting into act. 
After all, killers o£ Crunderthush 
not only national heroes, win plenty 
refrigerator and green stamps too!” 
“How about it, sir?” Whaffle said. 
“Have a go, eh? Not much to 
lose ...” 

“How? I can’t kill the beast by 
firing off a dispatch!” 

“Maybe we could dig a hole and 
let him fall in.” 

“Do you have any idea what size 
excavation would be required to 
inconvenience a ninety-foot behe- 
moth, you idiot!”

“Suppose the Ambassador had a 
little help. Would that be cricket?” 
Haccop cocked his wide head. 
“Is good questioning; have to check 
with Ministry of Tradition on that 
point.” 

“I’d love to help, of course,” Mag- 
nan said brightly. “It’s just that I 
have this cough — ” 

“Yes, kaff kaff,” Whaffle said. 
“Must be the damp air, all these 
confounded canals — ” 

“Will you let them out of the cell 
to scout the area and plan some 
strategy for the kill?” Retief asked. 

Haccop shook his head. “Nix. 
Oath-breakers incarcerated by order 
of Big Shots. Release also have to 
clear through same. But glad to 
check up after nap-time.” 

“When will that be?” 

“Nap over late tomorrow after- 
noon; maybe Midget - with - shiny- 
head and pals have just time turn 
trick before deadline.” 

“How can we kill a dinosaur while 
we’re locked in here?” Splitwhistle 
demanded. 

“Should have think of this before 
break oath,” Haccop said briskly. 
“Interesting problem. Interesting see 
how comes out.” 

O utside, Retief drew Haccop 
aside. “I don’t suppose there’s 
any objections to my taking a look 
around? I’d like to see what this 
monster looks like.” 

“Sure. Do what you like, no 
charge for look at Crunderthush, 
see free any time — just so you got 
money pay way.” 

“I see. I don’t suppose you’d lend 
me an official guide?” 

88 



“Correct. Rockamorran great tight- 
wad, don’t lend nothing, especially 
to foreigner.” 

“All I have is pocket change. I 
don’t suppose you’d cash a check?” 
“Hey, you skillful guesser, Terry!” 
“I can see it’s going to be a bit 
difficult to get around, without 
funds.” 

“Very shrewd analysis of situa- 
tion.” 

“Perhaps you’d advise me how I 
could earn some cash in a hurry.” 
“Oh-oh, guess wrong that time, 
spoil record. Better find answer, 
though. You run out of cash, you 
automatically slave.” 

“I get the feeling you don’t much 
care whether this menace is removed 
or not.” 

“Is correct assumptation. Big 
tourist drawing card. Also more fun 
this way, have something to bet on. 
Odds ten to one against Terries.” 
“Meanwhile, he goes on eating 
people.” 

“Sure, few peasants get devour, 
but so long Crunderthush avoid eat 
me, is no scales off my sitz-plats, 
in word of immortal bard.” 
“Shakespeare?” 

“No, Egbert Hiesenwhacker, early 
Terran trader introduce cards and 
dice to Rockamorra.” 

“Cards and dice, eh?” 

“Sure; you like play? Come on, 
have fun, forget troubles, help kill 
time up to big affair tomorrow.” 
“That’s a good idea, Haccop; lead 
the way ...” 

ft was dawn when Retief emerged 
from the Rockamorran gambling 
hall; Haccop followed him at the 

IF 




IV 



end of a light chain attached to a 
steel ring riveted to his ankle, carry- 
ing a large basket of Rockamorran 
currency. 

“Hey, Retief-master, lousy trick 
fill up when I got three ladies of 
ill repute — ” 

“I warned you about those inside 
straights, Haccop. Now tell me 
something. All that information the 
boys gave me about Crunderthush’s 
habits: was that all the straight 

dope?” 

“Sure, Retief-master. Pukka in- 
formation.” 

“All right, next stop the Ministry 
of Tradition. Lead on, Haccop.” 

An hour later, Retief emerged 
from the Ministry, frowning. 

“It’s not the best deal in the 
world, Haccop, but I suppose it’s 
better than nothing.” 

“Should have offered bigger 
bribes, boss.” 

“I’m on a tight budget. Still, I 
think we have a fighting chance. 
I’m going to need a heli and a good 
pair of binoculars. See to it at once, 
and meet me at the Grand Canal in 
half an hour.” 

“Boss, why worry about small- 
timers back in hoosegow? Look, I 
got plan. We be partners, you deal 
and I circulate around behind op- 
position and signal with trick sun- 
glasses — ” 

“We can discuss business later. 
Get going, before I report you to 
the Slave Relations Board for in- 
subordination.” 

“Sure, chief, chop-chop!” Haccop 
set off at a lope, and Retief headed 
directly for the nearest sporting- 
goods shop. 



H alf an hour later, Haccop 
dropped a second-hand float- 
mounted heli in beside the quay 
where Retief waited beside a heap 
of goods, waved cheerfully from the 
cockpit. Retief caught the mooring 
rope, pulled the light machine close, 
handed in his purchases and boarded 
“They say Crunderthusn is for- 
aging a mile or two east of town. 
Let’s buzz over that way and size 
him up.” 

The heli lifted above the fern-like 
palms, beat its way across the 
gleaming pattern of canals and 
dome-shaped dwellings of Rocka- 
morra City, gaining altitude; beyond 
the tilled paddies at the edge of 
the town a vast swamp stretched 
to distant smudges of jungle. 

“That’s him, boss!” Haccop called, 
pointing. Retief used the binoculars, 
picked out a towering shape almost 
invisible among the tall trees grow- 
ing in clumps in the shallow water. 

“He’s big, all, right. But he seems 
to be eating tree-tops. I thought he 
was a meat-eater.” 

“Sure, meat-eater, master. Dumb 
peasant climb tree get away, Crun- 
derthush not have to bend neck.” 
The heli approached the browsing 
dinosaur at three hundred feet, 
circled him while Retief observed. 
The giant saurian, annoyed by the 
buzzing interloper, raised his great- 
jawed head, emitted a bellow like 
a blast on a giant tuba. Retief 
caught a vivid glimpse of a purple 
throat wide enough to drive a 
ground-car through, studded with 
fangs like stalactites in a cave.

“Friendly looking fellow. Is it pos- 
sible to predict his course?” 
“Maybe. Crunderthush always 
take it easy, graze village over 
pretty good before move on to next. 
About done here, I estimation. By 
lunchtime start toward next stop, 
half mile south.” 

“Let’s cruise over that way.” 
Haccop dropped the heli to a 
fifty-foot altitude, buzzed across the 
flat water, leaving behind a pattern 
of blast-ripples, bending the scat- 
tered reeds in the wind of its pas- 
sage. 

“How deep is the water here?” 
Retief called. 

“Knee-deep at low tide.” 
“When’s low tide?” 

“Hour before sunset tonight.” 
“What’s the bottom like?” 
“Exquisite soft mud. Hey, master, 
you like go down scroonch around 
in mud awhile? Is good for what 
ails you.” 

“Sorry, we Terries aren’t am- 
phibians, Haccop.” 

“Oops, big excuses, chief. Not 
mean draw attention to racial de- 
ficiencies.” 

“Will Crunderthush follow a 
straight course across the swamp?” 
The heli was over the mud walls 
of the next village now. Retief could 
see the inhabitants going about 
their business as usual, apparently 
undisturbed by their position next 
on the menu. 

“No telling, boss. Might get dis- 
tracted by juicy fisherman or un- 
wary swimming party.” 

“Can we hire boats down there, 
and a few helpers?” 

“Retief-master, you got enough 



cash to hire whole town.” He sighed. 
“That pot before last: I never 

figured you for eagles back to 
back — ” 

“No post-mortems,” Retief ad- 
monished. “Land there, in the mar- 
ket-place.” 

Haccop dropped the flier in, 
grinned at the quick gathering 
crowd of curious locals. 

“1 tell hicks go away, give Retief- 
boss room walk abound, do little 
shopping?” he suggested. 

“Absolutely not; we’re going to 
need them. Listen carefully, Hac- 
cop; here’s the plan that I have in 
mind . .” 

I t was late afternoon when Re- 
tief, wet and plastered to the 
hips with black mud, signaled to 
Haccop to land at the northernmost 
point of the village, a narrow finger 
of land edged by a baked mud 
retaining wall. Half a mile away, 
wading ponderously across the shal- 
lows, Crunderthush rumbled softly 
to himself. 

“That sound carried well across 
the water,” Retief commented. “It 
sounds as though he’s right on top 
of us.” 

“And will be, plenty chop-chop,” 
Haccop pointed out. “Retief-master 
think r©pe across water make big 
fella fall down?” The Rockamorran 
waved a hand at the taut one-inch 
nylon cable stretched two feet above 
the surface of the water across the 
oncoming monster’s path. 

“He won’t get that far, if every- 
thing works out all right. How much 
time do we have? Another hour?” 
Retief asked.

“Crunderthush stopping now to 
scratch.” 

Retief observed the dinosaur 
sinking to his haunches, bringing up 
a massive hind leg to rake at the 
armored hide with two-foot talons, 
amid a prodigious splashing. “Maybe 
have hour, hour and half before 
dinner-time,” Haccop concluded ju- 
diciously. 

“Okay, let’s get moving! Get the 
hauling crew over here on the 
double. Have them attach a line to 
the center of the cable, and winch 
it this way until they can hook it 
over the trigger.” 

He pointed over toward a 
heavy timber construction consist- 
ing of an eighteen-inch pile pro- 
jecting a yard from the ground with 
a toggle mounted atop it. 

“Retief-chief, humble slave bushed 
from all day stringing wires to 
trees.” 

“We’ll be through pretty soon. 
How’s the axe-crew doing with 
that pole?” 

“Top hole, sahib. Pretty near got 
nice point on one end, notch on 
other.” 

“Get it set up here as soon as 
they’re finished. Prop it in the two 
forked saplings the boys are sup- 
posed to set in the bottom out 
there.” 

“Too many thing do all one time,” 
Haccop complained. “Bwana Retief 
have strange hobby.” 

“I’m taking the heli into town. 
I’ll be back in half an hour, have 
everything ready just the way I ex- 
plained it, or it won’t be just Terry 
heads rolling around here,” Retief 
warned. 



V 

'T^he great pale sun of Rocka- 
A morra with its tiny blue-white 
companion was just sinking in a 
glory of purple and old rose as 
Retief returned to ground the heli 
at the village. 

“Ohio, Retief-san!” Haccop called. 
“All set, accordingly- to plan! Now 
we hit trail, plenty quick! Crunder- 
thush too close for maximizing ad- 
justment!” 

“Look at the creature!” Whaffle 
quavered, descending from the heli. 
“As big as a Yill Joss-palace — and 
coming this way!” 

“Why have you brought us here, 
Retief?” Splitwhistle demanded, his 
jowls paler than usual. “I prefer be- 
heading to serving as hors d’oeuvre 
to that leviathan!” 

“It’s quite simple, Mr. Ambassa- 
dor,” Retief said soothingly, leading 
the stout diplomat across to where 
Haccop stood beaming beside the 
completed apparatus. “You merely 
use this mallet to hit the trigger. 
This releases the cable, which drives 
the lance — ” 

“R-R-R-R-Retief! Are you un- 
aware that — that — ” 

“I know. He looks pretty big at 
a hundred yards, doesn’t he, Mr. 
Magnan? But he moves slowly. We 
have plenty of time.” 

“We? Why include us in this mad 
venture?” Ambassador Splitwhistle 
demanded. 

“You heard what Haccop said, 
sir. You gentlemen have to person- 
ally kill the creature. 1 think I have 
it arranged so that — ” 

“Oh-oh, Master!” Haccop pointed.

“Look like distraction! Couple drunks 
going fishing!” 

Retief followed the Rockamor- 
ran’s gaze, saw a dugout pushing 
off with two staggering locals sing- 
ing gaily as they took up paddles, 
steered for deep water on a course 
that would take them within fifty 
feet of the dinosaur. 

“Try to stop them, Haccop! If he 
changes course now, we’re out of 
luck!” 

Haccop splashed out a few yards 
into the mud, floundering, cupped 
his hands and bellowed. The fisher- 
men saw him, waved cheerfully, 
kept going. 

“No use, boss!” Haccop waded 
back to shore. “Look, better you 
and me make tracks, hit town 
farther up archipelago. Swell float- 
ing crap game going — ” 

“Mr. Ambassador, stand by!” Re- 
tief snapped. “When I give the word, 
hit that trigger, and not a second 
before!” He sprinted to the small 
wharf nearby, jumped into a teth- 
ered boat, slipped the painter, poled 
quickly out toward the Crunder- 
thush. The monster was poised now, 
mouth open, gazing toward the fish- 
ermen. He emitted a rumbling growl, 
turned ponderously, took a step to 
intercept them. Retief, cutting in 
front of the dinosaur, waved his 
paddle and shouted. The giant reptile 
hesitated, turned to stare at Retief, 
rumbled again. Then, at a burst of 
song from the happy anglers, swung 
back their way. 

Retief stopped, plucked a rusty 
fishing-weight from the bottom of 
his skiff, hurled it at Crunderthush. 
•It struck the immense leathery chest

IF 




with a resounding whop! at which 
the monster paused in mid-swing, 
brought its left eye to bear on Re- 
lief. It stared, cocked its head to 
bring the right eye into play, then, 
its tiny mind made up, raised a huge 
foot from the mud with a sucking 
sound, started for Retief. 

He eased the boat back with 
quick strokes of the paddle. The 
dinosaur, tantalized by the receding 
prey, lunged, gained thirty feet, 
sending up a swell which rocked the 
tiny craft violently. Retief grabbed 
for balance, and accidently dropped 
the paddle. 

“Retief-boss!” Haccop boomed. 
“This not time to goof!” 

“Somebody do something!” Mag- 
nan’s voice wailed. 

“He’ll be devoured!” Whaffle 
yelped. 

The dinosaur lunged again. His 
power-shovel jaws gaped, snapped 
to with a clash of razor-edged 
crockery a yard short of the boat. 
Retief, standing in the stern, gauged 
the range, then turned and raised 
an arm, brought it down in a 
chopping motion. 

“Let her go, Mr. Ambassador!” 
he called, and dived over the side 
of the boat 

S plitwhistle, standing transfixed 
by the trigger apparatus of 
the over-size arbalest, gaped as 
Crunderthush raised his long neck 
twenty feet above the water, stream- 
ing mud, emitted an ear-splitting 
screech, and struck at Retief, swim- 
ming for shore. At the last instant, 
Retief twisted, kicked off to the left. 
The monster, confused, raised his 



head for another look; his eye fell 
on the diplomats on shore, now only 
fifty feet distant. At his glance, 
Splitwhistle dropped the heavy mal- 
let, turned and sprinted for the heli. 
Four others gave sharp cries and 
wheeled to follow. As the stout 
mission chief bounded past Secretary 
Magnan he tripped, dived face-down 
in the soft dirt. 

The mallet skidded aside. Mag- 
nan sprang for it, caught it on the 
second bounce, leaped to the trigger, 
and brought the hammer down in 
an overarm swing — 

There was a deep, musical boing! 
The sharpened twelve-foot hard- 
wood pole leaped forward as the 
taut nylon sprang outward. 

Crunderthush, just gathering him- 
self for the final satisfying snap at 
the morsel in the water before him, 
rocked back as the lance buried 
half its length full in his chest. Re- 
tief surfaced in time to see the 
dinosaur totter, fall sideways with 
a tremendous splash that swamped 
the sea wall, sent a tide of mud 
and blood-stained water washing 
around the frantic Terrans fighting 
for position at the heli hatch. Split- 
whistle sat up sputtering as the flood 
receded from his position. Magnan 
sat down hard, fumbled out a hanky, 
watching the stricken monster kick- 
ing spasmodically. Haccop whooped 
delightedly, plunged into the water 
to assist Retief ashore. 

“Nice going! Siki. Plenty meat 
here for barbecue for whole town! 
Dandy substitute event for disap- 
point of not to see Terry head- 
chopping after all!” Haccop said, 
delighted.

D abbing at his mud-caked shirt- 
front, Ambassador Splitwhis- 
tle nodded curtly at Retief. 

“Having gotten me into this awk- 
ward situation, young man, I’m glad 
to see that you carried on to rectify 
matters. Naturally, I could have ex- 
tricated myself and my staff at any 
time, merely by a skillful word in 
the right quarter, but I felt it would 
be valuable experience for you to 
work this out for yourself.” 

“Hey, Retief-m aster, 1 form Ter- 
ries up in column of ducks, go get 
fitted for leg-irons?” 

“No, I don’t think that will be 
necessary, Haccop. >; 

“What’s that? Leg irons?” Split- 
whistle choked. “See here, you nin- 
compoop, I’ve slain your monster, 
as required by your barbaric code! 
Now I demand — ” 

“Slave no demand nothing,” Hac- 
cop said. “Slave hold mouth right, 
work hard, hope for escape beating.” 
The Ambassador whirled on Re- 
tief. “What, may I ask, is the mean- 
ing of the idiot’s drivelling?” 
“Well, Mr. Ambassador, the 
Rockamorrans have very rigid rules 
about this sort of thing. However, 
I managed to work out a deal with 
them. Ordinarily, you couldn’t have 
any assistance with your promise.” 
“Assistance? I seem to recall that 
you were disporting yourself in the 
swamp yonder when I — er, ah — 
a member of my staff, that is — 
dispatched the brute!” 

“True. But the Rockamorrans 
seem to think I had something to 
do with it. Under the circumstances 
94 



they agreed to commute your sen- 
tence to slavery for life.” 
“Slavery!” 

“Fortunately, I was able to buy 
an option on your contracts — pro- 
vided you still had heads — ” 

“Buy up ... ? Well, in that case, 
my boy, I suppose I can overlook 
the irregularity. If you’ll just run 
along and see to my baggage — ” 
“I’m afraid it’s not quite that 
simple, sir. You see, I still have to 
pay your upkeep. And since I’ve 
spent all my money buying you — ” 
Splitwhistle sputtered. 

- — I’ve had to hire you out to 
earn enough to cover living expenses 
until the ship gets back.” 

“But — but — that will be 
weeks — ” 

“Okay, Terries; I, Haccop, am 
slave foreman. First job, strip out 
blubber from dead monster. Good 
job, take maybe two weeks, keep 
you in ration with maybe little left 
over for pack of Camels once a 
week.” 

“But — but — Retief! What will 
you be doing in the meantime?” 
“Haccop tells me there’s another 
dinosaur operating a few miles east. 
If I can bag it, that will give you 
another two weeks work after this 
job’s finished. With a little luck, I 
can keep you going until the ship 
arrives.” 

“Hey, Retief.” Haccop came close, 
whispered behind his hand. “Maybe 
better bring thin-face slave name 
Magnan along you, me. Got idea 
Midget-with-bad-temper hold grudge, 
Magnan trip him and make him lose 
number one position in dash for 
heli.” 



IF 




“Good idea, Haccop, bring him 
along.” 

T wo hours later, Retief, Haccop 
and Magnan, bathed and clad 
in new Rockamorran hose and 
doublets, sat on a tiled roof terrace, 
dining on a delicately spiced cas- 
serole of white fish and sea vege- 
tables. The view out over the town 
and the water to the east was 
superb; the brilliant light of the 
three moons showed the silvery 
waterways, the island villages and, 
distantly, the great hulk of the dead 
dinosaur, its four legs in the air, 
and four tiny figures crawling over 
it like fleas. Their arms, wielding 
machetes, could be clearly discerned. 

“Retief, no time linger over suc- 
culent native dishes,” Haccop said. 
“Plenty big game of Red Eye just 
getting under way at Tavern of 
Golden Ale Keg.” 

“Don’t rush me, Haccop. Order 
us a second round of drinks — but 
none for Mr. Magnan. He doesn’t 
indulge. The Ambassador doesn’t 
approve of booze.” 

Magnan blinked at him thought- 
fully. 



“Ah, Retief, knowing your skill 
with the pasteboards and the, er, 
galloping dominoes, why couldn’t 
you secure sufficient capital to pro- 
vision Ambassador Splitwhistle and 
the others without the necessity for 
their stripping all that blubber?” 

Retief sampled the fresh drink 
the waiter put before him, nodded 
appreciatively. 

“Mr. Magnan, the ship won’t 
arrive for at least six weeks, possibly 
longer. Would you recommend that 
a non-accredited diplomat with Am- 
bassador Splitwhistle’s personality be 
permitted to run loose among the 
Rockamorrans for that length of 
time?” 

Magnan looked grave, swallowed 
hard. “I see what you mean, Retief. 
But if he finds out, he’ll be quite 
furious.” 

“I don’t intend to burden him 
with the knowledge, Mr. Magnan. 
Do you?” 

Magnan pursed his lips. “No,” he 
said. “What he doesn’t know won’t 
hurt him, eh?” He managed a ten- 
tative smile. “Speaking of which, I 
think I’ll have that drink after all.”

Next Month in If . 

These extra pages in If are giving us a chance to do some things that would have been out 
of the question before. Next month we complete Doc Smith's great Skylark DuQuesne serial 
. and we bring the first installment of another serial that's been asked for for a long time. 
More and more letters have been coming in demanding that we give Retief a chance to spread 
himself in a novel. We aim to please — and so does Keith Laumer — and next month we start 
Relief's War. Even for Retief, the planet he has taken on this time is pretty wild and wooly. 
Its inhabitants are half-animal and half-machine; its social structure is — well — chaotic; and 
its perils are extreme. Relief's War . Next month. Don't miss it.

Alien Artifact 

by DANNIE PLACHTA 



There was something strange 
about the alien ship — and 
not just about its origin! 



T he patrol craft Solar Sea was 
no more than a billion miles 
beyond the orbit of Pluto, when the 
radar chief signalled the captain’s 
cabin. The captain, walking briskly, 
acknowledged the call with a grop- 
ing hand at the night stand. “Cap- 
tain here. Good morning!” 

“Radar, sir. Chief reporting.” 
“What have you got?” the captain 
asked. 

“A big blip sir. Projected inter- 
section at about a hundred thousand 
miles. Presently about one hundred 
forty thousand. Solid as a rock, sir.” 
The captain fumbled again about 
the night stand, and squinting his 
eyes at the sudden light, rolled out 



of bed. “Keep on it. I’ll be bridge- 
side when I’ve dressed.” 

It was somewhat less than five 
minutes later that the captain stood 
with the radar chief, looking down 
at the circle of dim light that held 
its own universe of minute pseudo- 
stars and vaguely glowing gas 
clouds. “Big and solid,” commented 
the chief. 

“Very big and very solid,” said 
the captain, with no trace of ex- 
citement. 

“Randy says projected intersec- 
tion now at approximately twenty 
thousand miles, Captain,” reported 
the man at the computer control 
board. Like all the newer patrol 



96 



craft, the Solar Sea had the latest in 
compact computer systems — one 
of the hyper-efficient Random- 
Series Portables. To the officers 
and crew of the Solar Sea t it was 
“Randy,” and the ubiquitous “Ran- 
dy only knows!” was a favorite in 
the ship’s complement of assorted 
oaths and wisecracks. 

“Order Randy three-quarter de- 
celeration, and stand by for full 
stop,” called the captain from his 
position at the radar scope. 

The programmer at the computer 
board responded with an “Aye, aye, 
sir,” and the ship shuddered as it 
braked. After an unsteady moment 
in which the captain held tightly to 
the hand rail surrounding the radar 
scope, he took the four strides nec- 
essary to put him alongside the 
programmer’s chair. “Randy’s scan- 
ning, sir,” said the programmer. 
“Nothing yet.” 

A fter two full minutes of decel- 
eration, a small green light 
winked on the board. “Here it 
comes, Captain . Randy says al- 
loy construction . alloy construc- 
tion , Captain ... no functioning 
power source detectable . alien 
artifact !” 

“Tell Randy to get the hell out 
of here! Full power and general 
alarm!” The captain grabbed at a 
hand rail, and another shock quaked 
through the ship. 

They had tried every means of 
remote communication at their dis- 
posal. There was not the slightest 
indication of awareness or acknowl- 
edgement from the alien craft. Even 
the nuclear flares failed to bring a 



response. Randy’s scanning reports 
were consistent: “No significant 

emission of any type detectable . 
Course unaltered . Disposition 
unchanged.” 

So the captain and a dozen 
volunteers boarded the space skiff, 
to fall in a long arc toward the alien. 
“If anything happens to us, or even 
the Solar Sea” reasoned the cap- 
tain, “at least Randy’s log-tapes will 
have been monitored at the base. 
And we’ll have the portable TV 
units along. They’ll know as much 
as we did.” 

Final attempts at communication 
from the closely orbiting skiff failed 
to produce a reaction, and the pilot 
brought the small boat alongside 
the huge alien craft. The pilot re- 
mained at the controls as the rest 
of the group, led by the captain, 
suited-up and exited. 

After pounding on the outer wall 
of the otherwise silent hull for what 
seemed to the captain like a reason- 
able period of time, the expedition 
prepared an entranceway with the 
frank utilization of a small 
bomb. “At least they’ll know we’re 
here,” explained the captain. 

“I hope we picked a good spot,” 
volunteered one of the men. 

“Hope it isn’t the ladies’ powder 
room,” cracked another crewman, 
floating at the rear of the group. 

“Leave your suits on at all times, 
stay close, and keep your TV units 
sweeping your immediate area,” 
commanded the captain, as he 
ducked into the still aperture. The 
rest of the party followed quickly, 
the last man waving toward the 
cockpit of the drifting skiff. 



ALIEN ARTIFACT 



97 




T he ship was huge, with rooms 
to match. The explorers wan- 
dered along for hours, never stop- 
ping for more than a few seconds, 
until they realized that they had 
covered it all. The cartographer, 
consulting his portable equipment 
and sketching as he went along, in- 
formed the captain of this soon af- 
ter they had passed the point at 
which they had entered. The group 
halted for a conference. 

“All of these rooms are exceed- 
ingly large and open,” suggested one 
of the crew, “and it would be diffi- 
cult to stay concealed . unless they 
are very small.” 

“Considering the size of the 
compartments and equipment we’ve 
seen, I would consider creatures 
smaller than ourselves unlikely 
aboard this craft,” replied the cap- 
tain, glancing quickly about. “I can 
only conclude, with very minor 
reservations, that we are the only 
living things aboard. This is, I very 
strongly suspect, a derelict.” 

At the captain's order, they 
left for what the cartographer as- 
sured them was the center of the 
ship. It was decidedly the largest 
room aboard, and the captain felt 
that it should be the first area to 
be more carefully investigated. 

As they began a detailed search, 
one of the crewmen approached the 
captain. “Sir, perhaps no one was 
ever aboard. This may have been a 
sort of gigantic robot probe,” he 
theorized. 

That theory was abandoned a 
moment later when several of the 
crew discovered the large plastic- 
like sheets. There were, they found, 



thousands of them in what looked 
like filing drawers along the expan- 
sive walls. They were quickly iden- 
tified as very detailed charts on 
maps of entire solar systems, as well 
as individual stars and planets of 
all sizes. 

“Why this one resembles our own 
planetary system,” indicated the 
captain, “and there’s earth, I think.” 
They marvelled at the thin plates, 
poking and waving their TV cam- 
eras at the intricate markings. “Let 
Randy have a good look,” said the 
captain, “perhaps we can get a 
rough translation.” 

“This must be their chart room,” 
someone decided, and the others 
agreed. 

“They had a sense of direction,” 
concluded the captain, as he pre- 
pared to return to his ship. 

I n his cabin near the bow of 
the Solar Sea y the captain sat on 
the edge of his bed, or “bunk,” as 
he preferred to call it, and wrote 
meticulously into his diary, or “log”, 
as he preferred to call it, of the 
extraordinary events of the past few 
hours. He paused to reconsider a 
particularly colorful phrase, when 
the sound of a signal bell impelled 
him to reach out for a switch on 
the night stand. “Captain here. 
What have you got?” 

“Computation, sir. Chief report- 
ing.” 

“Well, did Randy have any luck 
with a translation from those maps?” 
“We have a preliminary report, 
sir. And, Captain, Randy says they 
aren't maps. They’re blueprints.”

IF • Novelette 




by C. C. MacAPP 



Illustrated by GIUNTA 



Steve Duke had fought on a thousand 
outlandish battlegrounds — but never 
against weapons as strange as these J 



I 

T he ship, a converted Scout 
Tender, was crammed with 
supplies, equipment, and a draft of 
one hundred malassorted and sullen 
slave Techs — mostly Gjiss, with a 
scattering of Sabrils, B’lant, and 
humans. None of them, except Steve 
Duke, had even an inkling of their 
destination. 

They’d made several null-hops and 
now, judging by the way the hull 



thrummed, were dropping through 
atmosphere. The viewscreens weren’t 
on; this bunch didn’t rate privileges. 

The PA crackled and spewed 
orders. “All slave Ratings except 
Ship’s Personnel muster for disem- 
barkation!” Steve picked up his 
duffelbag and went with the rest. 
They formed ranks before an air- 
lock, with the subdued muttering 
which was all they dared. Six slave 
Gunners, heavy beamers ready, 
watched them disinterestedly. The 



99 





ship hung for a moment, then 
touched down with a mild jar. 

A screen glowed and the face of 
the ship’s commander — one of the 
Overseer race — appeared, wearing 
just the right combination of disdain 
and compassion. ‘‘Slaves, each one 
of you has failed Gree in some way. 
You deserve only the most degrad- 
ing labor, or to be live targets in 
training; and to die without His 
blessing and without hope of ressur- 
ection. But as Gree is a merciful 
master, He is giving you a chance 
to redeem yourselves. 

“This planet is formidable, and 
there is something here of great 
importance. What you are to do 
here will be worthy of any warrior. 
Those of you who die will die as 
heroes, with full forgiveness. Those 
who live will be given tests, and 
may regain their former statuses. 

“You will disembark now, and 
meet your new Overseers.” 

Or, as Steve translated inwardly, 
these slaves — disgraced, denounced 
some of them brainwashed or even 
brainburned, simmering with re- 
sentment that cried for a target — 
would be the advance skirmishers, 
entirely expendable. None of them 
(except him) really had much reason 
to live. 

T he night air was warm and 
dry. The Base was similar to 
many he'd seen — a solid periphery 
of buildings, their outward walls 
forming a line of defense, with the 
landing field and other important 
functions inside — but it differed in 
being eggshaped rather than circu- 
lar. Outside the big end of it, curv- 
100 



ing in a protective arc, was a very 
strong, high wall of logs, braced in 
such a way that Steve guessed it 
must be double, with a rock or dirt 
fill between. Other sides of the Base 
were not this protected. He didn’t 
understand what threat might come 
from one direction only. 

He moved as far as he dared 
from the landing-lights and looked 
up at the sky. Sentry globes moved 
a hundred feet above, but there 
were no stars. The sky must be 
completely overcast. 

An Overseer called, “Four ranks! 
Highest ratings in front!” Automati- 
cally, Steve stepped forward. Gun- 
ner, Third Grade, was the highest 
rank a slave could hold. He’d earned 
that legitimately once (though not, 
of course, under the false identity 
he wore now). 

They were counted again and 
marched toward the barracks. As 
they moved clear of the ship Steve 
suddenly saw a moon, small or 
distant, but bright, with clear mark- 
ings. The sky was not overcast. He 
took his eyes from the moon lest 
an Overseer notice his interest. 
According to his scant information, 
they’d been headed somewhere near 
the center of the galaxy. The sky 
should be rich with stars. 

Before getting bunks, they had 
to file one at a time through an 
Inquisition Booth. This was the 
first big hurdle. 

He stepped in, suddenly perspir- 
ing. There was a pause — longer 
than normal, he thought — then the 
voice of all Booths, deep, paternal, 
with a hint of warning, said, “What 
are your name and number?” 



IF 




The old emotions stirred in Steve. 
He fought them down; to let them 
seize him would be fatal. He forced 
himself to say, “Dunnek. 552 05 
8691.” As the Booth fed that 
through its circuits, checking for any 
prior data, he concentrated hard on 
the words, “I’m in a Booth. I’m 
in a Booth.” He fancied he could 
feel the stir in his brain, as the 
delicately implanted metal molecules 
shunted nerve currents, blocked off 
memory trunks, controlled body 
responses. The fear subsided but a 
sullen resentment grew. He strove 
to keep other thoughts away. 

T he Booth said, “We have not 
received data on you, Dunnek. 
Why are you in disgrace 9 ” 

His voice was thick with the 
artificial resentment. “I failed to 
protect a shrine of Gree.” 

There was another pause while 
the Booth’s sensors probed at him. 
Then, “Where did this happen?” 
“Garlock One.” That was where 
Steve’s side had captured the real 
Dunnek. 

The Booth said, “We have data 
on Garlock One. But there is more 
in your heart than guilt. You had 
better tell, us what it is.” 

He wiped his hands on his uni- 
form. His next words might get him 
summarily liquidated. “The Over- 
seers failed too. I fled when they 
fled. Yet I was punished and they 
were not.” 

He sat, mentally cringing. But the 
Booth answered sooner than he 
expected. “You are wrong. Why do 
you say the Overseers were not 
punished?” 

GREE'S DAMNED ONES 



“Well . they went freely, with- 
out anyone guarding them. They 
even kept their weapons.” 

Now he did have a long wait. He 
knew that Overseers operated the 
Booths, aided by computers and 
memory banks. Would they consider 
him too rebellious to live? Or find 
some flaw in his story? 

Finally the Booth said. “You are 
a very impertinent slave. For this 
alone, you deserve the punishment 
you’ve received. Know, slave, that 
Gree himself dealt with the Over- 
seers who failed him. Who are you, 
to question?” A pause. “Since you 
are in your present situation, you 
will not be punished further; but 
your impertinence will be noted. 
You had best think deeply about 
your sins.” 

Incredibly, the exit opened. He 
walked out, shaking a little and 
slightly dizzy from the unnatural 
things that still flowed in his veins. 
But his superiors had been right. In 
this case, sullenness pleased the 
Overseers. 

H 

H ow much so, he discovered the 
next morning. They put him 
in charge of a troop of thirty-seven. 

They lifted him in an aircar to 
hover over the Base while they 
aimed a telescope toward some 
mountains to the east. These weren’t 
isolated peaks; lower chains led off 
to either side, but these were mucti 
higher, and snow-capped. When he 
put his eye to the scope he saw a 
section of a slope below the snow- 
line. The Overseer said, “Do you see 

101 




that cliff-face in the center of the 
field?” 

The scope had shifted a bit. He 
located the cliff. “Yes, sir.” He took 
his eye from the instrument and 
looked at the mountains. They must 
be sixty or seventy miles away, but 
the air was clear, and he finally saw 
the cliff naked-eye. It must be big, 
to be visible at all. Below it was a 
wide band of forest, almost black 
in the distance. He traced out a 
waterway that pointed more or less 
at the cliff. The Overseer said, 
“Seen enough?” 

“I think so, sir.” 

“All right. You’re to take your 
troop and find a way on foot to 
that cliff. For various reasons we 
can’t show our technology * over or 
near those mountains. You’ll have 
primitive weapons; iron, but below 
the gunpowder stage. You’ll wear 
primitive clothes. For part of the 
way you’ll have a radio transmitter, 
disguised as something else. Beam it 
only toward this Base. Our answers 
will come by relay from those lower 
mountains to the right, so they 
won’t be beamed wrong either. 
When we can’t reach you any more, 
you’re to get reports to us as long 
as you can. After that you’re to use 
your best judgment, but try to 
survive and bring back a final 
report. It .doesn’t matter how many 
of your troop you lose. Do you 
understand?” 

After a moment, Steve said, “Yes, 
sir.” 

The Overseer said, “You’ll meet 
some odd things along the way. Be 
cautious, but observe them carefully 
and report. You’ll have to live 
102 



mostly off the land; we can’t send 
flyers to supply you. Incidentally, 
you are one of four Sorties, and 
what you report may help others. 
Unless you have questions, that is 
all.” 

T he sun was hot, but bearable. 

They wore or carried gar- 
ments of leather and some animal 
wool coarsely woven. Their buskins 
were thick soled. They had bows and 
arrows and crude hand-axes, ropes, 
water-bags, rough blankets. There 
were flints for striking fire, salt for 
the meat they’d kill. The transmitter 
— carried by a Communications 
Tech, Second Grade, named Vay — 
was built into one of the bows. 

Steve was the only Third Grader, 
and there were only two other 
Gunners, both Seconds, and both of 
the race called Sabrils. Like all 
Gree’s humanoids except humans 
and B’lant, they were better at ex- 
ecuting orders than at thinking for 
themselves. Not that they were 
stupid; they just weren’t leaders. As 
Sabrils went, Keerno and Hurogil 
were good troopers. Keerno was the 
taller, and instantly distinguishable 
from Hurogil because one cheek 
and one side of the jaw were flesh 
transplants, and much lighter than 
the blue-black of his skin elsewhere. 
Hurogil had a few scars of his own, 
and an uneven gait from some 
injury. Even he was over six feet, 
with narrow sloping shoulders and 
a slender, though wiry, build. Their 
eyes were wide and narrow, with 
yellow irises that made some people 
uncomfortable. Their mouths were 
thin-lipped and turned down at the

corners. Their ears were pointed and 
hung back and down. They sweated 
like fury in the sun, and needed 
lots of water. 

Vay was the only other Second 
in the troop. All the others were 
Firsts (which meant they’d at least 
completed Hive-world training in 
arms, tactics and survival) and were 
all Gjiss, like Vay. They were among 
the more human-looking of Gree 
slaves, but they looked like squat, 
very hairy, very muscular humans. 
Their planet had high gravity so 
they were fine porters, though not 
fast afoot. They tended to be morose 
rather than sullen. 

All, of course, spoke B’lant and 
English in addition to their own 
languages. Those two were re- 
quired. 

He took Keerno and three Gjiss 
for an advance guard. The rest 
came in a body, surrounding Vay. 
Steve put a ridge between the Sortie 
and Base as soon as he could, to 
test his communications. He went 
back and looked at Vay question- 
ingly. The Gjiss said, “Ve got gon- 
dac, Gunner.” 

Steve took the disguised trans- 
mitter. “Base, this is Sortie Four. 
Four One speaking. We do not have 
line-of sight. The ridge between us 
looks like sandstone. There are a 
few small holes in it that look like 
bullet-holes but could belong to 
insects. There are insects about. 
There’s some very thin desert 
growth, like lichens. I’ve seen a few 
animals about the size of my hand, 
catching insects. They look like six- 
legged starfish but seem to have 
internal skeletons. There are a few 
104 



small birds or large insects whose 
wings move fast enough to hum. 
I’m starting up a wadi that has low 
bushes in it. Report ends. Four One.” 
The answer came back, faint and 
squeaky. “Four One, give us a short 
carrier wave every half hour, even 
if you have no report. End. Base.” 

T he wadi was from fifty to a 
hundred yards wide, sandy, 
twisting between low hills, with 
vertical banks up to ten or twelve 
feet in places. The plants were 
green enough to prove subsurface 
water. They were the height of a 
man, squat, with twisting branches 
and thick-set small round leaves. 
The small flying things fed on the 
leaves, and he took time to study 
one. It was odd. The oval bodies 
were the size of a man’s thumb, 
with stubby, leathery wings set on 
each side. There seemed to be no 
head or tail — each end of the body 
was a large facetted eye, with a 
short flap over it that might be an 
eye-shade or an auxiliary wing. 
There were no legs, but the wings 
were prehensile, and on the under- 
side of the body were two orifices 
that served as suction cups and 
mouths. 

He hadn’t seen any other birds. 
A couple of hours up the wadi 
they began to cross patches of grass, 
where pools probably lasted into the 
spring. Not long after that they saw 
their first animals grazing. 

Steve was with the advance guard 
again, and he was moving cautiously 
to the middle of the wadi to see 
around a turn. The animals saw 
him as he saw them. 



IF 




They were quadruped, thin- 
bodied and long-legged, and with 
very long necks that were now held 
straight up in alarm. They had no 
horns, but the feet were clawed, 
not hoofed, and the teeth were big, 
if flat. He judged the animal 
weighed three hundred pounds. It 
had more hair than he expected to 
see in a desert. 

Several of the big males took a 
few steps forward. They didn’t 
seem on the point of charging, but 
they weren’t giving ground. He said 
quietly to the Sortie, who’d stopped 
when he had and were still out of 
the animals’ sight, “Grazing animals, 
but big. Ready with arrows. Four 
of you climb out on that side and 
go fifty yards upstream. Hit one 
of these males that are facing me, 
without warning. One’ll do it.” 

Five minutes later, four arrows 
flashed in the sun. The chosen male 
bleated and leaped high. He came 
down running, but his legs collapsed 
and he went sprawling and kicking. 
The herd broke and galloped up- 
wadi without any more delay, bleat- 
ing softly. As they went clouds of 
the flying things rose from the 
bushes, circled, and settled back. 

The carcass seemed to be normal 
protein, so Steve chewed a bit of 
it, raw, while it was being butchered. 
The taste was reassuring. Some- 
thing else wasn’t, though: a swarm 
of the flying things circled and 
hovered, turning their big eyes at 
the Sortie. Now and then a few 
of them would take a bee-line up 
the wadi out of sight. The way 
they acted reminded Steve of me- 
chanical fly-eyes. 

GREE'S DAMNED ONES 



Later, he reported that to Base. 
“Ah,” the reply came, in an Over- 
seer’s voice. “We had not seen that 
before. We have dissected the 
things, and they are organic, but 
the form is peculiar. You are ob- 
servant, Gunner. I shall follow your 
progress with interest. By the way, 
I am your own Overseer.” 

Steve acknowledged as simply as 
possible. The last thing ■ he wanted 
was close attention from an Over- 
seer. 

T here were tracks of more ani- 
mals, several kinds, but he saw 
only one new creature during the 
afternoon: a very slender, timid 

thing about eight inches high that 
looked as nearly canine as feline. 
It ate the starfish-things that ate 
insects. It hunted singly. 

He made camp in the middle of 
a wide spot, openly, with several 
fires; but put out sentries to lie 
quiet under the brush in case any- 
thing tried to sneak in. The Gjiss 
were in better spirits, eating huge 
chunks of the meat, which was good 
except that the brushwood fire gave 
it a faint taste of creosote. Keerno 
and Hurogil were their taciturn 
selves. Steve stretched out on his 
blanket under a bush to let his 
tired muscles relax, but something 
was tugging at the edge of his mind. 
He napped briefly, and took a turn 
on watch. Then, later, when all the 
fires but one had been allowed to 
die, he remembered. 

He looked around to make sure 
no one was too close, then reached 
casually and put the tips of three 
fingers behind his left ear. He felt 



105 




for slight bumps and pressed them; 
the middle one first, then the 
lower, then the upper. He lay for a 
few minutes. A slight dizziness came, 
and a quickening of the pulse. Then 
it was as if a faint voice whispered 
to him: “Colonel Duke: by now 
you’ve passed the Booths and are 
ready to know. The operation you’ve 
been smuggled into is somewhere 
inside a cloud nebula that is very 
dense and has some peculiar prop- 
erties. We have never been able to 
null into it. 

“Gree has heard rumors of a very 
ancient weapon depository there, 
guarded by unknown sciences. Your 
job is double: to see what is hap- 
pening, and to send us a locator 
as soon as you can. You have this 
locator. It has been built into the 
small projector you carry, which 
shows human females dancing in the 
nude. In this case, your erotic 
tastes are useful. It will still pro- 
ject, and will appear to be nothing 
else barring very close examination, 
but it is also a pair of devices. When 
you are able, turn it on and off 
five times, quickly, then break it 
in two. One half will null to where 
we can find it and trace it back. 
Keep the other half. When we null 
a fleet in and begin the attack, step 
on it or otherwise crush it, and it 
will pinpoint you for us. 

“Good luck. We will replace the 
projector for you, with new pictures. 

“This implant in your brain will 
dissolve beyond trace within an 
hour. There are no other implants.” 

Steve swore under his breath. The 
projector was in his personal ditty- 
bag at the Base. 



HI 

I t must have been near morning 
when a faint sound woke him. 
He twisted onto his belly, in position 
to get up fast, and listened. Some- 
thing was coming down the wadi 
making swishing sounds in the brush. 
The small moon was still up, but k 
only seemed to make the wadi 
darker. He wondered if he ought 
to douse the fire. He heard others 
stirring and decided not to give an 
alarm yet. 

The thing was coming slowly and 
steadily, as nearly as he could 
judge, and in a straight line, making 
no effort to avoid the brush. It was 
near one side of the wadi, and, if 
he could judge, now about fifty 
yards up it. He heard the hum of 
small wings as the fly-eyes were 
disturbed from their roosts. Still no 
other sound. He wondered if the 
thing could be a very persistent 
small whirlwind. 

Then he heard one of his sentries 
on that side mutter something in 
Gjiss and move from his hiding spot 
He caught the word, “Gree.” The 
thing, whatever it was, came on 
steadily. He was sure now it was 
no animal. He heaved himself to 
his feet. “Hurogil! Take charge here. 
Guards! Come with me!” He groped 
for one of the torches stacked ready; 
thrust it into the fire until it flared. 
He grabbed a hand-axe. The two 
Gjiss on fire-guard had torches 
now, and followed him. He held 
the torch high with one hand, and 
saw the sentry, feet planted wide, 
staring into the darkness. He was 
muttering again. 



106 



IP 




Then Steve was within a few 
yards of him, but blocked by a 
thick clump of brush. “Stand aside!” 
he ordered the sentry, “Let’s get a 
look at it!” 

The sentry ignored him. The bush 
he was facing shook, mildly, and 
something drifted out. It was barely 
visible in the torchlight, hardly big- 
ger than a grape, black, a slightly 
flattened sphere, tumbling slowly as 
it drifted. It was at chest height 
and moving horizontally or nearly 
so. 

The sentry reached out to take 
the thing. Steve, suddenly guessing 
what would happen, shouted at him, 
but the hand was already closed 
around the object. The hand moved 
back. The Gjiss grunted in surprise, 
flexed his arm muscles, then gasped 
and jerked his hand away. Steve 
saw the object touch his chest. The 
sentry screamed and threw himself 
down. Steve saw the object drifting 
on, bloody now, in the same slow 
trajectory. He yelled, “Hurogil! Take 
care of this man,” turned to see 
Hurogil start toward him, then 
himself turned to follow the strange 
missile. 

He could have followed it even 
without the three torches, by its 
progress through the brush. He 
caught up to it and followed as 
closely as the brush would allow. It 
was, he saw, aimed slightly down- 
ward, so it would hit the ground 
sooner or later. 

But before it did, the wadi turned, 
and it pushed into a bank. There 
was a puff of dust and a small 
hole where it went in. He could 
hear it grinding through the sand- 



stone. Finally it stopped or got too 
far to hear. 

Steve listened a minute, then told 
his two Gjiss, “Go back and get 
Vay here, fast. Tell Hurogil to break 
camp and move down here.” 

T he thing took some diggihg to 
find. It had penetrated . nearly 
twenty feet, and didn’t show a 
scratch. The sentry who’d tried to 
stop it was dead, of bleeding, not 
poison. 

Steve reported to Base and was 
told to stand by. Meanwhile, he 
made a few experiments. 

Eventually the Overseer answer- 
ed. “Tell me the details, Gunner.” 
Steve described the events, then 
added, “It’s as if the stuff had 
tremendous mass but very little 
susceptibility to gravity. By getting 
an axehead under it and lifting, you 
can eventually get it rising. It keeps 
rising unless you stop it. We almost 
lost it once. But if you get it 
hanging perfectly still, beside some- 
thing so you can measure, it begins 
to fall very slowly after a while. 
If you hit it — ” 

The Overseer interrupted, “We’ve 
studied the objects, Gunner. What 
we want to know, among other 
things, is where they start from and 
how they are accelerated even to a 
low speed.” 

Steve felt his face grow warm. 
“If I’d known about them I might 
have saved a man.” 

The Overseer said casually, “Ho 
died for Gree, Gunner.” 

Steve controlled himself. “Yes, sir. 
I suppose I can expect more of 
them?” 



GREE'S DAMNED ONES

“Fin sure you can. Sortie One 
reports a man dead, too. They had 
him on watch on top of a knoll, 
at night, which was a very foolish 
thing.” 

H e got the dead Tech buried, 
and left the black pellet on 
the grave. It wasn’t very practical 
to take it along. He wondered if, 
and how, he could take one with 
him, assuming he ever got away 
from here. His superiors would want 
to see it. 

As they advanced they met more 
of the things, sometimes coming 
down at sharper angles, but not 
much sharper. He was doing well, 
so far as casualties were concerned 
— the other three Sorties reported 
a total of seven so far. Probably 
he was better protected, in the wadi. 

As it happened, his second cas- 
ualty came when they had to leave 
the wadi to detour around the first 
marshy spot. It wasn’t one of the 
black pellets. 

They’d been following the edge, 
and came to a small dry wash that 
joined the wadi. The bottom was 
covered with spiney six-inch grass. 
Steve and his advance group stopped 
at the edge before stepping down. 
Steve saw nothing in the grass but 
small insects. There were a few of 
the fly-eyes humming over it. Up 
the dry wash a mile or so, there 
was a herd of the grazing animals 
he’d, met before. 

He poised to step down, but 
before he did one of the Gjiss 
hopped down into the grass. The 
humanoid let out a peculiar sound, 
then screamed. He tried to jump, 



fell clumsily, screamed again. He 
squirmed as if he were stuck on a 
bed of nails. He raised his head 
and Steve saw droplets of blood all 
over one side. The Gjiss stared up 
at him for a moment, then fainted. 
Others ran forward. “Stand back!” 
Steve ordered. “Get some rope and 
a hand-axe up here!” 

He got the axe head wedge un- 
der the victim’s belt, and they hauled 
him out by that. Grassblades stuck 
out all over him, and there were 
punctures where others had pulled 
free. He was obviously dying, prob- 
ably of the punctures in his head. 
Steve took hold of one of the grass- 
blades and pulled gently. It wouldn’t 
come out. It wasn’t rigid. He pulled 
harder, steadily, and eventually it 
came out slowly. When it did, it 
wanted to keep on going. The top 
of it did, at least; the rest trailed 
in the air. Blood ran down it and 
formed a drop, but didn’t fall off. 
Steve let it go. 

He jabbed the flat of the axe 
down at the grass and it was like 
hitting concrete. He noticed now 
that while some of the grassblades 
bent in the breeze, others were 
perfectly still. He pulled one of 
those out — slowly — and got it sus- 
pended in the air before him. He 
gave a sudden jerk and the grass 
came away, leaving a small black 
nodule hanging in the air. 

He pushed at it with the axehead 
so it would drift to the ground, 
then walked to the dead Gjiss and 
looked at the soles of his buskins. 
They were punctured in dozens of 
spots, and grass was wedged in 
some of the holes.

IF 




When he reported, the Overseer 
listened carefully and complimented 
him. Then he said, “Gunner, this 
will be our last transmission to you; 
you’re getting too close to the moun- 
tains. You are to keep sending 
reports direct until you’re near the 
forest. You must leave the trans- 
mitter with some Techs, and send 
reports back to them to transmit. 
Do you understand?” 

“Yes, sir.” Steve tried not to 
sound ironic. 

“Fine, then. Good luck, Gunner.” 
Steve handed Vay the transmitter 
and started toward a small knoll 
to look around. He thought he’d 
stay near here for a few days, 
studying things, before he went on. 

IV 

H e learned that not all of the 
spiney grass was deadly. When 
it was first sprouting, it didn’t have 
the black nodules in it. While the 
nodules grew and ripened (if that 
was the right word) the grazing 
animals, and other animals, knew to 
avoid it. Later, it got rid of the 
nodules, and that process was in- 
teresting. When the grass began to 
turn brown, each stalk developed a 
gas pressure, swelling to three times 
its diameter. Gradually, the nodule 
yielded. It had only an inch to go 
to the top of the stalk, but when 
it got there it was rising two or 
three feet a minute. It kept rising. 
Some patches sent up a real hail 
of .the things. He could imagine 
what it would be like for a bird — 
or an aircar — to fly into it. The 
latter, though, if it had a good hull 
GftEE'S DAMNED ONES 



and moved very slowly, should sur- 
vive. 

He watched the large animals 
grazing in a ripe patch that had 
lost its nodules. They moved their 
feet very slowly and carefully, as 
if there might be a few nodules 
left. A man could do the same 
thing, he reflected, if he had the 
right kind of shoes. 

One night as he lay awake it 
occurred to him that the nodules 
might have something to do with 
the unnatural cloud nebula. That, 
of course, was what hid the stars 
here, and made it so difficult to 
null in. Why wasn’t this sun at least 
a little haloed? Maybe its radiant 
pressure had cleared a sphere around 
it and its planets. If so, Gree had 
somehow learned the coordinates to 
null in. 

He wondered about the nodules 
that rose from the grass. If they 
kept going beyond the atmosphere, 
they’d make it impossible to null in. 
And if they didn’t, they must come 
down again. 

He tried not to imagine one of 
them drifting down, gently as a tiny 
black snowflake — and gently sink- 
ing through his head. Maybe, he 
told himself, the stuff gradually sub- 
limed or disintegrated. 

But if you could work the stuff — 
and get a strong gun-barrel and a 
real driving charge behind it — what 
a bullet it would make! 

T he wadi became a creek in the 
foothills, and two days up that 
was the edge of the forest. Steve 
found a campsite behind a hill, 
established Vay there, and led the 

109 




first patrol out. By the time they 
reached the trees, they’d seen two 
more of the grape-sized black pel- 
lets 

The dominant kind of tree wasn’t 
over a hundred feet tall, but it 
spread sideways half again that. Its 
bark was in overlapping scales, each 
six inches in diameter, deep brown. 
Scales lay about as if they shed 
individually. The base of the trunk 
was a system ot big splayed-out 
roots, with grass and underbrush 
between them. At thirty feet or so 
from the ground, the trunk split into 
a dozen or more big limbs, some of 
them horizontal. From these, twigs 
sprayed out, supporting needlelike 
foliage. Here and there, vines hung 
to the ground. The trees didn’t 
crowd each other, so the trunks 
were widely spaced, but under- 
growth filled most of the space. 
There were game trails, and a 
variety of tracks. He heard bird- 
calls deeper in the forest. Not far 
from him, one of the frail quadru- 
peds he’d seen catching the starfish- 
things trotted into sight, saw him, 
and went up a treetrunk. More 
feline than canine, then. There were 
a few of the fly-eyes, into every- 
thing as always. 

A treetrunk nearby had a hole 
through it, quite fresh, as if a long 
auger had come through. He knew 
what had done that. The scales on 
both sides were pierced neatly. He 
found other holes, some nearly 
grown shut. Evidently the trees were 
used to being pierced. 

He wasn’t inclined to take the 
patrol in at once, so he took them 
up the higher of the two hills 



bracketting the creek they’d come 
up, until he found a tree at the 
edge of the forest where he could 
spend a few hours now and then, 
just watching. Then he turned back 
to camp. 

The hill muffled the forest sounds 
that night, but there were animal 
calls, and once something screamed 
and thrashed about heavily. He 
didn’t like the prospect of pene- 
trating this forest with only primi- 
tive weapons. He was sure, though, 
there’d be no way around it. 

I t was two days before he 
actually saw the pellet throw- 
er at work. He’d spotted a source; 
two pellets had come from a thicket 
within sight of his tree. All he saw 
was a gentle motion, then the 
pellets drifted out, horizontally, di- 
verging just a few degrees. Then, 
late in the afternoon, one of the 
small frail quadrupeds came sneak- 
ing by the thicket, pausing to raise 
its big ears, turn its head, and 
listen. It went on out of sight. 

A minute later another animal 
appeared, evidently trailing the 
other. This seemed to be of a 
related species, but it was three 
times the height and anything but 
frail. It stopped beside a thicket 
to listen and sniff the ground, then 
started across the small natural 
clearing. 

Suddenly there was motion all 
around it. Things like flexible 
broom-handles came swinging from 
the brush in an odd slow motion, 
blocking the several ways out of the 
spot. They reached straightness and 
continued to bend the opposite way, 

IF 



110 




like springs very heavily weighted. 
Without seeing, Steve guessed 
there’d be other bars — more slen- 
der, maybe — in the brush, to form 
a complete fence. 

The beast, after a second’s crouch, 
whirled, saw that it was surrounded, 
and hurled itself at what looked like 
the weakest spot. It squalled and 
bounced back. It bit at itself once, 
then leaped to bat with its paws at 
the broomsticks, which were still 
flexing slowly. Then it sprang back 
to the center of its prison and 
crouched, panting. Steve saw blood 
drip. 

At half a dozen points around the 
prison, things moved slowly. Steve 
got a good look at one. It was like 
a three-foot length of heavy plank 
grown over with bark. It too flexed 
Uke a spring, but only moved 
through a very short arc, staying 
nearly vertical. As it passed its 
deadpoint and began to slow, black 
pellets drifted from it. More came 
from the other directions, criss- 
crossing. The beast whirled, seeking 
a way out, then sprang in the di- 
rection it had come. It screamed 
as it hit the first pellets; contorted 
in mid-air, fell and hit the ground 
writhing. There were pellets at low 
level too. It bit at itself mindlessly, 
then collapsed and lay shuddering 
a moment before it went limp. Steve 
saw pellets emerge from it and sail 
away or plow leisurely into the 
ground, driving before them fur and 
blood and bits of bone. 

Now a thing like a tentacle 
snaked from somewhere. It poised 
above the carcass, nosed down 
delicately, and forced its point in. 

GREFS DAMNED ONES 



A tremor, as if of ecstasy, ran 
along it. 

Steve pushed down his revulsion 
and watched. The thing probed 
about inside the animal, apparently 
consuming bone and all, for the 
carcass gradually shrank like an 
emptying bag. At sundown he left 
The cage was still in place — to 
keep out marauders, perhaps — and 
the tentacle was still feeding. 

He spent most of the night plan- 
ning. They’d have to locate a num- 
ber of the things for study. That 
could be done, maybe, with long 
slender poles. If a pole hit a slender 
stalk that didn’t move, they had 
something. Too, knowing what to 
look for, they could spot the plank- 
like catapults. And they could cap- 
ture some of the grazing animals 
alive; force them into the traps and 
study the things. He didn't like that 
idea much, but it was better than 
sacrificing humanoids through ignor- 
ance. 

V 

A fter two weeks he had enough 
data to compose a report. He 
included: “The shoots that form the 
cage can move enough in two sec- 
onds to stop a humanoid. The cage 
is only thirty feet in diameter at 
most; so one man might get free if 
he moved fast. But a group of men 
would get in each others’ way. We’ll 
have to travel in groups because of 
large carnivores. 

“It’s possible to sate the things. 
After feeding, a plant is inert for 
at least twelve days; we haven’t had 
time to check longer. 

Ill 




“They apparently don’t need ani- 
mal protein to survive individually, 
but it’s connected with reproduc- 
tion. After feeding, a plant produces 
seeds the size of a man’s fist, with 
small black pellets in them for carry- 
ing power when they’re catapulted. 
If a seed hits a tree, it falls to the 
ground while the pellet keeps going. 

“This is intelligently planned. 
Making the meat-eating part of 
reproduction prevents the plants 
evolving away from it. 

“I think we can clear a way 
through by driving animals ahead 
of us, and otherwise locating the 
plants. I’m leaving Vay and eight 
Techs here with the transmitter. 
Probably we’ll be able to relay a 
few reports back once we’re 
through. Later, on higher ground, 
we’ll build campfires where you can 
see them with a telescope so you’ll 
at least know where we are. No 
doubt there’ll be other defenses, and 
they’ll probably be more subtle. 

“Report ends. Four One.” 

E ighteen days later, he stood at 
the upper edge of the forest. 
Within it they’d buried Keerno and 
two Gjiss. Two more Gjiss had been 
dragged away by carnivores. A 
group was headed back through with 
a report for Vay to send, and es- 
corting various wounded. Steve, 
Hurogil, and the thirteen Gjiss with 
them all had cuts or bad bruises, 
but none incapacitating. Now they 
faced something like ten miles of 
mild slopes covered with the spiney 
grass. In places, the black hail 
floated up from it. 

The plan he had was simple. 

? V12 



They had a section of tree-trunk, 
over a yard in diameter, about five 
feet long, peeled and made as 
cylindrical as possible. There were 
holes for spokes to give more lever- 
age, and wedges to jam behind it 
if it started to roll back. They were 
going to roll it through the grass, 
slowly, to clear a path. Also, each 
of them had oval slabs of thick wood 
to wear like snowshoes, in case the 
roller left a few nodules hanging. 
Steve had tested those before think- 
ing of the roller, but the grass was 
irregular enough to make a man’s 
balance insecure. Nobody wanted to 
fall. 

In the first few hours they col- 
lected new cuts, until they learned 
what to watch for. After that, it 
was just hard tedious work. Food 
was no problem — the swath stayed 
open behind them, so they could 
walk back and hu at the edge of 
the forest. 

They pushed and pried at the 
roller for five days. Toward the end 
it was very hard to move because 
the circumference was impregnated 
with nodules. But on the sixth day 
they were clear of the grass, with 
not more than five miles of rocky 
ground between them and the cliff. 
From here, the cliff-face looked 
very even and almost vertical. Steve 
said, “An hour’s rest. Then we’ll 
try to make it before night.” 

It turned out harder than that. 
There were stretches of jumbled 
rock, and crevices. They finally 
camped in one of those, a mile from 
the cliff. For the sake of morale, 
Steve risked a fire. He was pretty 
sure that if anything intelligent 

IF 




lurked above, it was aware of them 
by now; anyway, as tired and sore 
as he was, he didn't like the prospect 
of a cold night. 

A t daylight he bundled himself 
as warmly as practical and 
went scouting with two Gjiss. Look- 
ing back the way they’d come 
through the grass, the forest seemed 
ludicrously close. He couldn’t see 
beyond the forest, because a mist 
hung over it. 

He turned, and was looking at 
the cliff when he heard humanoid 
voices somewhere to his right. He 
gestured a warning to the Gjiss, 
and pointed to the gap between two 
large rocks. He led the way care- 
fully to where the voices sounded 
near, then motioned the two to 
wait, bows ready, while he peered 
into the open. 

There were a B’lant and two 
Gjiss with their backs to him, look- 
ing at the cliff. To their right, in 
cover similar to his own, were 
several more Gjiss. Obviously they 
were supposed to be guarding the 
trio’s backs, but they hadn’t seen 
Steve yet. They looked cold and 
miserable. 

The B’lant was lightly dressed, 
his thick gray skin adequate for 
colder weather than this. He had 
bandages around his left biceps and 
left calf. He and the Gjiss were 
carrying bows, waterbags, and not 
much else. 

Steve, unable to resist grinning, 
stepped into the open and said in 
his perfect B’lant, “I could have 
mowed you down with one sweep 
of a laser. Which Sortie are you?” 



They spun, the B’lant reaching 
for a weapon that wasn’t there. One 
glimpse of his blunt-featured, high- 
cheekboned face, and Steve’s own 
hand flashed uselessly to his waist 
A block of ice seemed suddenly to 
form in his stomach. 

But the B’lant’s eyes showed no 
recognition. They were a little off- 
focus, dull, vaguely troubled. Hii 
voice was slower than Steve remem- 
bered it, and slurred. “We are Sortie 
Two. My name is . Fazzool. Do 
you have any food? I need none 
yet, but my Gjiss . his words 
faded away. 

Steve let out his breath. Slowly, 
his shock turned to anger. Brain- 
burned! They’d brainburned Faz- 
zool; who — Newly shocked, Steve 
fought for self control. It hadn’t 
been he — not Steve Duke — who’d 
been comrade to Fazzool. If that 
other called Jen had lived in Steve’s 
skull, shared the same body, it hadn't 
been Steve’s choice. Steve should 
be hoping the brainburning was 
thorough. If it weren’t — if Fazzool 
could remember, ever — he’d re- 
member that a comrade called Jen 
had betrayed Gree; had twice tried 
to kill Fazzool, twice left him for 
dead. 

He controlled his face. “We’ve got 
meat.” It occurred to him he'd 
better have Fazzool where he could 
watch him. “We’re Sortie Four. My 
name’s Dunnek. Shall we join 
forces? There’s nothing in the orders 
against it.” 

Fazzool was looking at him with 
puzzlement. 

Finally he said, “Yes. Nothing 
. in the orders.”

T wo hours later, as they started 
toward the cliff, Fazzool’s 
mind was clearer. Steve kept out of 
his line of vision as much as he 
could. 

Before they reached the cliff, 
Steve became aware of a slight 
veiling before it. He stopped walk- 
ing. Fazzool stopped too, turned and 
gave him a look. “I zink,” he said 
in English, “zat will be more of ze 
black stuff.” 

Steve nodded, stalling for time. 
One of them ought to reconnoiter, 
while the other stayed in command; 
but he didn’t want to leave Fazzool 
in that position. He was relieved 
when the B’lant said, “Wiz my zick 
skin, it is best I go first.” 

An hour later the B’lant waved 
him forward. Steve left Hurogil with 
most of the Gjiss. When he reached 
Fazzool, the B’lant was standing at 
the edge of a deep chasm with 
water in it. The chasm was too 
straight, running out of sight in 
either direction, to be natural. It 
was possibly a quarter mile across, 
and the walls weren’t far from verti- 
cal, except where rock had fallen 
away. The water was several hun- 
dred feet below, and looked deep. 
From a strip of it, about a third 
of the width, along the middle, rose 
the faint veiling. Steve didn’t doubt 
it was more of the black stuff, 
though he was too far to see in- 
dividual particles. They might be 
dust, or half an inch in diameter. 

Fazzool said, “What do you zink 
is at ze bottom?” 

Steve shrugged. “Water-weeds, 
maybe, producing nodules like the 
grass. Though I don’t know whether 
114 



the damned stuff floats or not.” He 
pondered, and realized he didn’t 
know much about the actual mech- 
anism of buoyancy. 

He looked up at the cliff. It was 
continuous with the chasm wall; 
merely a mountain that had been 
sliced through. He found he wanted 
very much to know what was be- 
yond. He doubted there’d be any 
end to the chasm. “A circular moat,” 
he said half-absently, “around a 
stronghold.” He faced the B’lant. 
“Our orders say to go to the cliff. 
We’re close; but maybe we should 
actually cross this thing, if it’s 
possible. Would you be willing to 
try?” 

Fazzooi’s eyes looked clear now. 
He chuckled. “Willing? Is zere any 
zing zat you and I, Jen — ” He 
gasped, and his face contorted with 
agony. Brainstorming guarded pro- 
scribed memories brutally. He stood 
panting for a minute, then recovered 
enough to say, “Now why did I . 
call you zat?” His eyes were dull. 

S teve struggled with his own 
face. Finally he shrugged. 
“My name’s Dunnek.” So the burning 
wasn’t thorough enough. He found 
himself trembling a little. It seemed 
a terrible injustice that he should 
have to try a third time to kill 
Fazzool. And it would be an even 
worse injustice if he succeeded. He 
controlled his voice and said, “May- 
be a raft could cross, if it were 
thick enough and we could get it 
down to water level.” 

Fazzool was obviously struggling 
to think. “How did you ... get 
zrough ze grass?” 



IF 





Vuie&" 











Steve told him. Fazzool pondered, 
and finally nodded. “Zat lias ze 
advantage zat you can go back to 
hunt. Zat is why you had meat . 
And we can get lumber. But my 
way has more to do wiz zis moat 
here. I chopped some big zick 
planks, and we just laid zem gently 
on ze grass and kept leap-frogging 
zem. 1 zink if we make ze right 
kind of raft, zis black stu!‘ will not 
come zrough, but will just push it 
up a little.” 

Steve frowned over that. “Maybe. 
But still, how do we get it down 
to the water? And how’d we get 
up the other — ” He broke off, 
startled. “Why, of course! We put 
some of the stuff under the raft, 
and drift across up herel” 

VI 

T hey needed little extra lumber, 
with the planks Fazzool had 
and with Steve’s roller. After a 
little discussion, they realized they 
couldn’t bind the raft together with 
ropes, because the rising particles 
might cut them; so it had to be 
done with pegs, which was tedious. 

Gathering the black material was 
simple. If you just dropped a plank 
on top of the grass, with the right 
force, the nodules penetrated. Then, 
very slowly, you could pull it away 
and force it down somewhere else. 
As a plank became impregnated, it 
got hard to move, and to stop once 
it was moving, but that was just a 
matter of muscle and patience. The 
Gjiss were happy to be supplying 
that, with plenty of meat and animal 
skins for warmth. 



The finished raft was over two 
feet thick (with six inches of virgin, 
or at least unimpregnated, wood on 
top), about twelve feet long, eight 
feet wide. The width, Steve admitted 
to himself, was a concession to 
preconceived ideas of stability. A 
few inches in from the edge, a 
handrail ran all around, a foot above 
the deck. It began to look like 
something. 

A launching-course was ready: a 
stretch of rock slanting up gently 
to the lip of the chasm, smoothed 
and filled, to as perfect a plane as 
possible. The rollers were ready too; 
the hardest, straightest tree-limbs 
available. 

It took a day and part of a night 
to get the raft into position, with 
rollers under it and stakes behind 
it to keep it from rolling back, 
before morning. 

Steve knew he was laying up 
trouble (if he ever got back to 
Base) by going alone with Fazzool. 
But Fazzool wasn’t protesting, and 
everyone else here was outranked. 

They seated themselves, Fazzool 
in front, and made sure the things 
they were taking were secure. The 
launching crew threw their weight 
against the raft, grunting with ef- 
fort. Nothing happened at first, of 
course. They continued to strain, 
cursing in Gjiss. Fazzool chuckled. 

A roller creaked. 

I n twenty minutes Steve thought 
he could feel motion. An hour 
more the Gjiss strained, muscles 
bulging, new shifts taking over pe- 
riodically. The rollers were definite- 
ly turning now. Hurogil put a new 

IF 



116 




one at the front. It was two hours 
more before they neared the edge 
of the chasm, moving perhaps twen- 
ty feet a minute. A roller at the 
front dropped free, into a rack put 
there to catch it. Another plunked 
on top of it. Steve had to control 
his instincts now, as the nose of 
the raft poked out over the abyss. 
Fazzool turned to grin at him. 

The end of the raft parted from 
the last roller and now they would 
have to jump if they changed their 
minds. Then it was too far for that. 
Steve looked over the edge at the 
dark water. It was many minutes 
before he could really convince him- 
self they weren’t going to fall. 

He thought of ‘magic carpets’. 
He would almost rather have de- 
pended upon magic than upon this. 

As they neared the middle, he 
could see that the rising pellets 
were the size of peas, but fewer 
than he’d expected. They rose very 
slowly. He felt the first jar as one 
hit the raft. It was mild, but that 
the raft transmitted the jar at all 
was disturbing. They came steadily 
after that. There was a splintering 
sound; the first audible one. 

The front end of the raft began 
to tilt upward, very slowly. That 
went on even after the rear of the 
raft was in the curtain too; and 
would until they emerged. He felt 
his weight shift backward, and felt 
with his foot for the rail there. A 
hatchet slid, startling him, but it 
was tied on. The tilt was at least 
fifteen degrees now; they’d started 
with less than five. He saw Fazzool’s 
left foot feel about, find the tied 
hatchet and brace against it. The 
GREE'S DAMNED ONES 



B’lant was clinging to the front rail, 
too. Steve grew really concerned. 
They were still in the curtain and 
the tilt was thirty degrees or more. 
He tried not to think what it would 
be like if they tilted to vertical and 
beyond. 

B ut then they nosed out of the 
curtain, and soon he could 
feel the tilt reverse. The last few 
thus sounded at his end of the 
raft, then they were clear. But there 
was another worry — they’d gained 
considerable upward drift, and were 
going to clear the opposite side by 
two hundred feet or more. The 
cliff, ahead and to their right, 
seemed to sink slowly, as it 
approached. They passed the face 
and were still rising faster than the 
land beneath them. It was too far 
to jump, even from the end of 
their ropes if they tossed them over. 
For all he knew, they’d rise until 
the air was too thin to breathe. Al- 
ready, it was chill as the sun sank 
lower behind them. Night came on. 
He moved up beside Fazzool and 
they tried to see the ground ahead. 
The small moon rose, but wasn’t 
much help. 

But the raft was heavy; and even 
with the added pellets imbedded in 
it by the curtain, it eventually began 
to sink. Their nose was tilted slightly 
downward now. They tried to guess 
whether they’d reach the snowline. 

They fell short of it. They stepped 
off the raft just before it touched, 
their arms burdened with what they 
could hold. The raft bumped gently, 
then proceeded to grind itself 
deliberately into kindling. Steve 

117 




stepped back from the flying splin- 
ters. A few logs off the top broke 
free and skidded away, but the 
rest thrust on into the growing pile. 
After that was over, he could still 
hear the black stuff pushing deeper 
into the rock. 

FazzooPs voice was amused in 
the dark. “Ziss will make a fine 
bonfire. Shall we light it now?” 

Steve said, “It’s a temptation. But 
let’s get away from here instead, 
before something comes to investi- 
gate.” 

They lugged what they’d salvaged 
back downslope and found a pass- 
ably sheltered place to spend what 
was left of the night. Steve hoped 
Hurogil’s further experiments, after 
watching the crossing, would show 
some inspiration. It hadn’t occurred 
to anybody that the raft would be 
a total loss so far as returning was 
concerned. 

T he morning sunlight was daz- 
zling on the snowy peaks, 
which looked only four or five 
miles away. The two climbed the 
nearest prominence to look around. 

The chasm, and the forest beyond 
it, were in clear sight. He wondered 
whether they should hike back to 
the cliff and signal Hurogil at once, 
or do a little exploring first. Before 
he mentioned that to Fazzool, he 
saw six or seven of the fly-eyes 
going over, headed east. He pointed. 
“I’ve already reported they come 
from this direction. Pm for follow- 
ing right now.” Fazzool agreed. 

Among the things they’d brought 
were two pairs of the foot-slabs, 
which now turned out to be usable, 
118 



but just barely, as snow-shoes. Cer- 
tainly, they couldn't do much hiking 
on them. 

They trudged up the first snow- 
covered ridge, the top of which 
temporarily hid the peaks beyond. 
Steve kept watching Fazzool unob- 
trusively. Soon, he must decide what 
to do. He couldn’t wait; they — or 
he — would have to get back and 
show himself to Hurogil, or the 
Sabril might decide they’d been 
killed, and not wait for them. 

He decided to wait until they 
turned back. 

They crossed the top of the ridge 
and he stopped, staring down and 
to his right, then went prone on 
the snow. Fazzool wriggled forward 
beside him. It was too circular a 
basin to be natural; and the bottom 
was too level. The warmth that kept 
it green must be artificial too. 

It was perhaps two miles across, 
and a thousand feet deep. The slopes 
were covered with snow to about 
two-thirds the way down. Below 
that, bare rock showed some 
erosion. There was a mound in the 
center, and that was eroded too. 
There seemed to be only one kind 
of shrubs, green and fairly dense, 
but too irregular for recent culti- 
vation. There was healthy-looking 
grass, not the spiney kind, he 
thought. 

Fazzool said, “Nobody home for 
a long time, I zink. I also zink it 
could be a trap.” 

“Maybe,” Steve said. “But I’ll bet 
this is where the fly-eyes come. And 
I’ll bet there’s a ring of these places 
around the peaks, if the others 
haven’t stopped working. Anyway, 

IF 




it would be a hard climb back out 
again.” He was thinking something 
else. A blow on the head, and let 
the body slide down . No; too 
conspicuous here; Gree might have 
flyers over before long. Some crev- 
ice on the way back. 

H e squirmed back from the 
edge and automatically looked 
around before getting up. He saw 
something against one of the white 
peaks. Dots; in a line, seeming to 
rise from the mountainside. He 
grunted a warning to Fazzool, and 
let his mind race over the way 
behind them. No cover near enough. 
He watched the dots begin to scatter 
in all directions, including this. It 
would have to be the basin, and 
fast. 

He got some bad bumps sliding 
down, and again envied Fazzool his 
tough hide. They got to the first 
bushes and he looked back. The 
sun, at its present angle, didn’t 
make their trail too conspicuous. 

They separated until they could 
just keep track of each other, and 
crawled under bushes. Minutes 
passed. Steve got out some cooked 
meat and chewed on it; swigged 
water. They’d have to stay here 
until dark, at least, if they weren’t 
discovered before. While he had 
the chance, he noticed the fly-eyes 
in the shrubs around him. They had 
some kind of symbiosis with the 
plants, as he’d begun to guess. There 
were immature ones attached to 
(maybe growing out of) twigs, 
matured ones leaving and others 
coming to attach themselves. In the 
grass were dead ones, with some- 
GREE'S DAMNED ONES 



thing like ants working on them. 
Whoever had set this up had been 
thorough. They reproduced here — 
that kept them coming back — and 
they even died here, to provide 
fertilizer. He was sure they brought 
some kind of visual impressions, 
whether anyone ever read them any 
more or not. There was no telling 
how long the thing had been self- 
perpetuating. Mechanical, weapons 
could rust or wear out, or be 
ruined by earthquakes, or lose their 
charges. An ecology like this might 
go on doing its job for eons. He 
was pretty sure it wasn’t intended 
for a system of defense — what 
defense couldn’t be breached? — but 
for an alarm. 

The chances were that the objects 
rising from the mountain meant the 
alarm had been heard. But they 
still didn’t necessarily know anyone 
had crossed the moat. 

He wasn’t surprised, though, when 
a number of the objects ringed the 
basin and descended into it. They 
were a little bigger than Gree 
sentry globes. He lay perfectly still, 
but they set up a search pattern 
and nosed him out quickly. One 
hovered and incinerated a small 
circle of ground a few feet from 
him. 

There was no use pretending 
he didn’t get the message. He 
crawled out and stood up, feeling 
more disgust than anything else. 
He’d just gotten too used to his 
luck, and stretched it too far. In- 
terrogation was the least he could 
expect; vivisection the worst. For- 
tunately, he could tell all he knew 
about Gree and enjoy it. 



119 




They let the globes herd them 
toward the mound in the center. 

When they were near it and 
enringed by the globes, dirt broke 
upward from the top of the mound 
and a humanoid figure appeared, 
obviously supported and protected 
by some kind of a field. Steve 
gasped and had to fight panic and 
the old feel of guilt; the residue 
of old conditioning. Fazzool gave a 
choked cry and dropped to his 
knees, covering his face. 

The figure was that of Gree. 

VII 

H e was able to put down the 
old conditioning and look at 
the humanoid. He still had plenty 
to worry about. The Gree figure 
he’d seen — once — had been a 
fraud; a semi-living body in which 
a non-organic entity disguised itself. 
That was designed to produce love 
and awe in slaves. His mind stum- 
bled over various possibilities. Had 
this whole thing been a fraud, to 
dig out traitors or spies? But this 
humanoid was studying him with 
curiosity rather than anger or tri- 
umph. And he wasn’t gotten up like 
Gree. He wore a simple overall 
garment, without the Gree insignia 
of four verticals and a horizontal 
to represent a hand. None of the 
precious-metal cloth, the whiter- 
than-white scarf at the throat. 
The beard was more practicably 
trimmed. The hair was the same; 
curly, black with a few white 
strands; but the two six-inch blunt 
ended horns that rose from it were 
not inlaid with gems. A sudden 
120 



thought struck him. Maybe this 
was the Old Race! Maybe Gree 
had simply adopted the form, for 
its obvious impressiveness. It was 
impressive. 

Fazzool was huddled, shaking, 
muttering thickly, “Gree lives! Gree 
lives ] 99 Steve knew the agony. 

A second figure, much like the 
first, rose from the mound. Steve 
looked for a minute, and an ex- 
plosive laugh burst from him. He 
reached out and roughly pulled 
Fazzool’s head up. “Look, old 
comrade! It’ll hurt, but look!” 

Fazzool resisted, but finally 
opened his eyes. He tensed and 
made a move as if to get up, but 
knelt there, trembling. “Two? Two? 
I — I’m insane! I ought to be — ” 
A spasm took him. When it abated, 
he got slowly to his feet and faced 
Steve. He looked murderous. “So. 
Yes; I remember.” He moved sud- 
denly toward Steve, knife flashing. 
Steve hurled himself aside. But 
another spasm seized the B’lant and 
he collapsed, moaning. Globes mov- 
he collapsed, moaning. 

The two figures on the mound 
were watching with puzzled looks. 
The voice of one came to him 
faintly, “They thought we were gods. 
But what happened?” 

I t took a moment to register with 
Steve that he understood the 
words. He stood a moment, com- 
pletely bewildered. That language — 
allowing for difference in vocal 
equipment — that language, he knew 
as well as B’lant or English. Ex- 
citement surged through him. He 
took a step forward, remembered the 

IF 




globes, and stopped. He raised his 
voice. “We’re not primitives! I 
don’t serve Gree. I’m here as a spy 
for the Birds of Effogus!” 

They looked as astounded as he 
must have a moment before. The 
one who’d spoke gestured, and the 
globes urged Steve forward. “The 
Birds of Effogus? What is Gree?” 
“An empire,” Steve said, “trying 
to enslave the whole galaxy. The 
rulers are from outside. They’re 
non-organic. The Birds of Effogus 
are resisting. Most of my race is 
enslaved, but the Birds rescued my 
own ancestors, and I fight with 
them. And — ” 

The spokesman interrupted. “The 
Birds are fighting? They’ve — have 
they taken up science again? Mili- 
tary science?” 

“Why . yes.” 

The spokesman sighed. “I’m sorry 
to hear their philosophy has bumped 
into the facts of nature. Though my 
branch of the race predicted it.” 

Steve said, “I’m afraid I don’t 
understand.” 

The humanoid looked at him for 
a moment. “Don t you know the 
name of this planet and the star 
it circles?” 

“No.” 

The humanoid said, “This was 
Effogus.” 

S teve was much annoyed that 
he got so little chance to talk 
to his custodians. They lent him 
tapes to keep himself occupied, and 
fed him well, but the waiting was 
almost unbearable. 

Finally they took him to see the 
spokesman again, in an office one 



wall of which was an image of the 
galaxy, seen from outside. It made 
him nervous. 

The humanoid noticed. and 
smiled. “We’ll deliver you home. 
Your friend had better go separately, 
by the way. He’s well and we’ve 
straightened him out, but it’ll take 
time for him to forgive you.” ' 
Steve said uncomfortably, “Yes. 
I, er, had to do it.” 

“We understand.” 

There was a silence which Steve 
couldn’t stand long. “Well . will 
you be helping us against Gree?” 
The other shook his head. “I’m 
afraid not. We’re no logger of your 
galaxy, and there are considerations 
I can’t discuss. We can’t even give 
you weapons.” 

Steve scowled, but could hardly 
argue. “At least, I hope you won’t 
let Gree have Effogus!” 

“We won’t let Gree have it, or 
take anything useful away with him, 
or find it again. There’s not much 
there in the way of weapons. It’s 
a portal and a warning system; also 
a decoy. We do keep some watch 
on your galaxy.” He stood up. “I’m 
afraid we’ll have to say good-by 
now; your transportation is waiting.” 
He smiled, a little mischievously. “I 
have been authorized to give you 
one thing. If the Birds have really 
given up their Dionysian dreams, 
they’ll learn things from it that will 
have military uses.” He extended a 
small package. 

“Well ... I don’t know what to 
say, except thanks. What is it?” 
“Certainly. It’s grass seed. You’re 
acquainted with this particular kind 
of grass.” END

too many times to risk a move against him now — until he has made sure 
of having every advantage he can get. It is not morality that keeps him 
from an attempt to stab Seaton in the back. It is pure prudence. 

But when he meets the race called the Jelmi, and learns from them 
the secret of the "gizmo" — the fourth-dimensional translator which permits 
him to strike anywhere in the universe without warning — he decides that 
the advantages are with him. Six hired gunmen are dispatched through 
the eerie realm of the fourth dimension into Seaton's spaceship, the Skylark , 
with orders to gun down Seaton and his five associates. 

They fail; but in failing they warn Seaton that DuQuesne has pulled a 
doublecross. Now Seaton's enemies are multiplied. Not only the strange 
winged-lizard-like creatures called the Llurdi, not only the beings whose 
life goes on in an atmosphere of pure halogenous gases, the Chlorans — 
but DuQuesne, more powerful than ever — and more determined. For 
DuQuesne possesses every secret of weapon and strategy known to Seaton 
himself — and he is coldly determined to use them all, to win a universe 
for his empire!

over and compare notes. 

Sitar, limping badly but with fur 
coat still glossily immaculate, proud- 
ly displayed a left leg bandaged 
from the knee all the way up. “A 
slash from here, clear down to 
there.” The Osnomian princess ran 
a fore-finger along a line six or 
seven inches long. “And a bullet 
right through there. That was the 



gaudiest fight I was ever in in my 
whole life!” 

Diinark, whose right arm was in 
a sling, spoke up. “She got that 
slash saving my life. I’d just taken 
this one through the shoulder — ” 
he pointed — “and was paralyzed 
for a second. So she kicked her 
leg up in the way — while she was 
flipping a gun around to blow this 
guy apart, you know — so his knife

went into her leg instead of my 
neck.” 

“Yes, but go on and tell them 
about how many times you — ” Si- 
tar began. 

“Sh-h-h-h,’ Dunark said, and she 
subsided. “Maybe some day we’ll 
write a book. How about you, Mart? 
1 notice you’ve been standing up 
all the time.” 

‘Til be standing up or lying on 
my face for a while, I guess.” 

“But that wouldn’t account for 
the cane,” Seaton objected. “Come 
clean, guy.”

rather, low down — no bones brok-

Shiro, who had a broken arm, 
would not talk at first, but they 
finally got the story out of him. His 
last opponent had been just too big 
and too strong and too well trained 
to be easy meat, but Shiro had 
finally got him with a leg-lock 
around the neck. “But how about 
you, Dick?” Shiro asked. “Whoever 
wrapped you up must get hospital 
supplies at wholesale.” 

Seaton grinned. “She had only 
one patient.” He told his own story, 
then went on, “Since we can all 
walk, let’s go over and see what 
thev’re finding out.” 

Ree-Toe Prenk had said that he 
wanted all thirty-one of the depart- 
ment heads taken alive if possible; 
but he had known that it would not 
be possible. He was surprised and 
highlv pleased, in fact, that only six 
of the Hish Exalteds had been killed 
or had taken their own lives. 

There is no need to go into the 
details of that questioning. Seaton 



took no part in any of it; nor did 
any of his group. He did not offer 
to help and Prenk did not ask him. 

Nor is it necessary to describe the 
operation outside the palace. The 
rebels had learned much from their 
previous failure, and they now had 
all the arms, ammunition and sup- 
plies they needed. Thus, before sun- 
set that day, every known quisling 
had been shot and every suspect 
was under surveillance. Premier Ree- 
Toe Prenk sat firmly in the Capitol 
City’s saddle; and whoever control- 
led that city always controlled the 
world. 

H ours before control was assured, 
however, Prenk called Seaton. 
“About the daily report to Chloran 
headquarters that is due in half an 
hour,” the new Premier said. “I am 
wondering if you have any ideas. 
Our ordinary reports are not dan- 
gerous to make, since they are made 
to underlings whose only interest 
in the human race is to encode and 
file our reports properly. But, since 
their automatic instruments have 
recorded much of this change of 
government, it will have to be re- 
ported in detail. And a Great One, 
or even a Greater Great One, may 
become interested, in which case 
the reporter’s mind may be search- 
ed.” Prenk looked thoughtful, then 
shook his head. “There’s no use try- 
ing to gloss it over. In an event like 
this the Greatest Great One himself 
will very probably become interested 
and the reporter will die on the 
spot. In any case, even with an or- 
dinary Great One, his mind will be 
shattered for life.”

IF 




“I see,” Seaton said. “I didn’t 
think of it, but I’m not surprised. 
We’ve tangled with Chlorans before. 
But cheer up; I’ve got news for 
you. I locked eyes with their Su- 
preme Great One . 

“You didn’t!” Prenk broke in, in 
amazement. “You actually did?” 

“I actually did, and I knocked 
him — it? — loose from his teeth.” 
Regretfully Seaton added, “But we 
can’t make a battle out of this.” He 
scowled in concentration for a min- 
ute, then went on, “Okay, there’s 
more than one way to stuff a goose. 
I’ll make the report. Let’s go.” 

T^Therefore, twenty-five minutes 
* * later, Seaton sat at an ultra- 
communicator panel in Communica- 
tions, ready to flip a switch. 

The reporter whose shift it was 
stood off to one side, out of the 
cone of vision of the screen. Crane 
sat — gingerly, sidewise, and on a 
soft pillow — well within the cone 
of visibility of the screen, at what 
looked like an ordinary communica- 
tions panel, but was in fact a battery 
of all the analytical instruments 
known to the science of Norlamin. 

“But, Your Exalted,” said the 
highly nervous reporter. “I’m very 
glad indeed, that you’re doing this 
instead of me, but won’t they notice 
that it isn’t me? And probably do 
something about it?” 

“I’m sure they won’t.” Seaton had 
already considered the point. “I 
doubt very much, in view of their 
contempt for other races, if they 
ever bother to differentiate between 
any one human being and any other 
one. Like us and beetles.” 



The reporter breathed relief. 
“They probably don’t, sir, at that 
They don't seem to pay any atten- 
tion to us as individuals.” 

Seaton braced himself and, exact- 
ly on the tick of time, flipped the 
switch. Knowing that the amoeboidf 
could assume any physical form 
they pleased and a matter of course 
assumed the form most suitable for 
the job, he was not surprised to see 
that the filing clerk looked like am 
overgrown centipede with a hun- 
dred or so long, flexible tentacles 
ending in three-fingered “hands” — 
a dozen or so of which were mani- 
pulating the gadgetry of a weirdly 
complex instrument-panel. He was 
somewhat surprised, however, in 
spite of what he had been told, that 
the thing did not develop an eye 
and look at him; did not even direct 
a thought at him. Instead: 

“I am ready, slave,” a deep bass 
voice rolled from the speaker, in 
the language of Prenk’s planet Ray- 
See-Nee. “Start the tape.” 

Seaton pressed a button; the tape 
began to travel through the sender. 
For perhaps five minutes nothing 
happened. Then the sender stopped 
and a deeper, heavier voice came 
from the speaker: a voice directed 
at the filing clerk, but using Ray- 
seenese . 

Why? Seaton wondered to him- 
self. Oh, I see . Soften 'em up. Scare 
the pants off of 'em , then put on 
the screws. 

“Yield, clerk,” the new voice said. 
“I yield with pleasure, O Great 
One,” the clerk replied, and went 
rigidly motionless; not moving a fin- 
ger or a foot. 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



125 , 




“It pleases me to study this mat- 
ter myself/’ the giant voice went on 
as though the clerk had not spoken. 
“While slight, the possibility does 
exist that some of these verminous 
creatures "have dared to plot against 
the Race Supreme. If this is merely 
another squabble among themselves 
for place it is of no interest; but 
if there is any trace of non-sub- 
mission, vermin and city will cease 
to exist. I shall learn the deepest 
truth. They can make lying tapes, 
but no entity of this or of any other 
galaxy can lie to a Great One mind 
to mind.” 

While the Great One talked, the 
picture on the screen began ' to 
change. The clerk began to fade out 
and something else began to thicken 
in. And Seaton, knowing what was 
coming, set himself in earnest and 
brought into play that part of his 
multi-compartmented mind that was 
the contribution of Drasnik, the First 
of Psychology of Norlamin. 

T his coming interview, he knew, 
must be vastly different from 
his meeting with the Supreme Great 
One of Chlora One. That had been 
a wide-open, hammer-and-tongs bat- 
tle: a battle of sheer power of mind. 
Here it would have to be a matter 
of delicacy of control; of precision 
and of nicety and of skill as well 
as of power. He would have to play 
his mind as exactly and as subtly as 
Dorothy played her Stradivarius, for 
if the monster came to suspect any 
iota of the truth all hell would be 
out for noon with no pitch hot. 

The screen cleared and Seaton saw 
what he had known he would see; 



a large, flatly ellipsoidal mass of 
something that was not quite a jelly 
nor quite a solid; a monstrosity 
through whose transparent outer 
membrane there was visible, a large, 
intricately convoluted brain. As Sea- 
ton looked at the thing it developed 
an immense eye, from which there 
poured directly into Seaton’s brain 
a beam of mental energy, so incred- 
ibly powerful as to be almost tan- 
gible physically. 

Braced as he was, every element 
of the man’s mind quivered under 
the impact of that callously hard- 
driven probe; but by exerting all his 
tremendous mental might he took it. 
More, he was able to hold his Dras- 
nik-taught defenses so tightly as to 
reveal only and precisely what the 
Great One expected to find — utter 
helplessness and abject submission. 

That probe was not designed to 
kill. Or rather, the Great One did 
not care in the least whether it 
killed or not. It was intended to 
elicit the complete truth; and from 
any ordinary human mind it did. 

“Can you lie to me, slave?” That 
tremendous voice resounded through- 
out every chamber of Seaton’s mind. 
“Or withhold from me any iota of 
the truth?” 

“I cannot lie to you, O Great 
One; nor withhold from you any 
iota, however small, of the truth.” 
This took everything of camouflage 
and of defensive screen Seaton had; 
but he managed to reveal no sign at 
all of any of it. 

“How much do you personally 
know, not of the details of the coup 
d’etat itself, but of the motivation 
underlying it?” 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



12 7 




“Everything, O Great One, since 
1 was Premier Ree-Toe Prenk’s right- 
hand man,*' and Seaton reported 
the exact truth of Prenk’s motiva- 
tion and planning. 

The Great One’s probe vanished, 
the screen went dark, and the send- 
er resumed its sending. 

“Huh!” Seaton wiped his sweating 
face with his handkerchief. “This 
dope isn’t of any interest, clerk old 
boy, so just file it away and forget 
it,’ His Nibs says. It’s a good thing 
lie was after Prenk’s motivation, not 
mine. If he’d really bored in after 
mine I don’t know whether I could 
have kept things all nice and peace- 
ful or not. I knew I’d been nudged, 
believe you me.” 

“I believe you,” Crane said, look- 
ing into his friend’s eyes. “Are you 
sure you’re all right?” And: 

The reporter goggled in awe. “And 
you can still talk intelligently, sir?” 

“Yeah.” Seaton answered both 
questions at once, but did not elab- 
orate. “What did you get, Mart? 
Anything?” 

“I learned where it is,” said 
Crane. Nothing else. 

Small reward for weeks of effort 
and risk of life . and yet it was 
for that the entire campaign on the 
planet Ray-See-Nee had been wag- 
ed! The whole operation had been 
designed to get that one fact. A peo- 
ple had been given new hope; some 
hundreds had lost their lives; many 
thousands had received scars they 
would bear a long time; a regime 
had been deposed and a new one 
put in power. 

But these were only by-products, 
only the small change of a victory 



which justified all of Seaton’s ef- 
forts . and would have its conse- 
quences in every part of the Uni- 
verse, for incalculable times to come! 

XIX 

Llanzlan Mergon 

R ay-See-Nee’s new department 
heads, in their meeting with 
Premier Ree-Toe Prenk in the Room 
of State, were in unanimous agree- 
ment that everything was under con- 
trol. Some quislings and recalci- 
trants had been shot and a few 
more would probably have to be. 
That was only to be expected. Yes, 
since all of the new incumbents had 
been jumped many grades in status 
and in authority and in salary, there 
was and would continue to be a 
certain amount of jealousy; but that 
was not of very much importance. 
The jealous ones would either accept 
the facts of life or be shot. Period. 

After the meeting was over Kay- 
Lee Barlo came up to Seaton. She 
now bore herself as though she had 
been born an Exalted; her ex-boss* 
pistol swung jauntily at one very 
female hip as she walked. As she 
came up to him and took both his 
hands in hers, standing so close to 
him that her upstanding, outstanding 
hair-do almost tickled his nose, it 
became evident that her weapon had 
been fired quite recently. She wore 
no perfume, and the faint but un- 
mistakable acrid odor of burned 
smokeless powder still clung to her 
hair. 

“Oh, Ky-El!” she exclaimed, equal 
to equal now. “I’ll simply never be 



128 



IF 




able to thank you enough. Nor will 
all Ray-See-Nee. This world will be 
an entirely different place to live on 
hereafter.” 

“I sincerely hope so, Kay-Lee.” 
Seaton smiled into the girl’s eager, 
expressive face. “Ray-See-Nee is 
lucky to have had as strong, able 
and just a man as Ree-Toe Prenk to 
take over.” 

“As you said a while back, ‘You 
can say that again.’ He’s all of that. 
What he’s done already is marvel- 
ous. But everyone knows — he does, 
too, he’s put you up on a pedestal 
a mile high — that it’s you who put 
him in the saddle. That’s what I 
wanted mostly to tell you. Also, I 
wanted to ask you — ” she paused 
and flushed slightly — “you’ll for- 
get, won’t you please, what I said 
about that louse’s brains? I didn’t 
mean that, really; I’m not the type 
to cherish a grudge like that. I was 
a little . well, I’d been a little 
put out with him, just before you 
came in.” With which masterpiece 
of understatement she gave his hands 
another vigorous, friendly squeeze 
and, swinging around, walked hip- 
wiggling out of the room. 

She thereupon took certain steps 
and performed certain actions which 
would have astonished Seaton very 
much, had he known about them. 
But he did not — until much later. 

Prenk came up to the Skylarkers 
a few minutes later. He shook hands 
with each of the off-worlders; thank- 
ed them in rounded phrases. “I 
would like very much to have you 
stay here indefinitely, friends,” he 
concluded, “but I know of course 
that that is impossible. If all the 



resources of the world could be de- 
voted to the project and if all our 
technical men could work on it un- 
detected for a year, we could not 
build anything able to withstand 
those Chlorans’ beams.” 

“We can’t either. Not here,” Sea- 
ton said. “That’s why we have to 
go; but we’ll be back. I don’t know 
when; but we’ll be back some day.” 
“I’m sure you will: and may 
Great My-Ko-Ta ward you and cher- 
ish you as you build.” 

B ack on what was left of their 
worldlet, now reconditioned to 
the extent that it was not likely 
to fall apart on the spot, and out in 
deep space once more, the Skylark- 
ers began efficiently and expertly 
to put the pieces of their victory to- 
gether. 

They had located the Enemy. 
They even had an operating covert 
base in Chloran territory, to which 
they could return at any time. They 
had weapons which, in theory at 
least, could cope with anything the 
Chlorans were likely to own. 

Yet Seaton fretted. The weapons 
were there, but his control was not 
adequate; the weapons had outgrown 
the control. Dealing with Chlorans 
was touchy business. You wanted 
all the space you could get between 
you and them. Yet. at any operating 
range which even Seaton, to say 
nothing of Crane and the others, 
considered safe, their striking power 
was simply too erratic to denend on. 

“It’s a bust,” Seaton said gloom- 
ily. “Course, if worst came to worst 
I could go back to undercover meth- 
ods. Smuggle in a bomb, maybe —

just to throw their main centers off 
balance while the rest of you hit 
them with all we’ve got. I could stow 
away aboard one of those ore-scows 
taking the booty off Ray-See-Nee 
easily enough — ” 

‘‘You talk like a man with a paper 
nose.” Dorothy scoffed. “I have a 
picture of that expedition — of you 
in armor, with air-tanks strapped 
on your back and lugging an under- 
water camera or projector around. 
Un-noticed ... I don’t think.” 

And Dunark added, “And since 
you haven’t got any idea of what 
to look for, you’d have to lug around 
a full analsynth set-up. A couple of 
tons of stuff. Uh-uh.” 

Seaton grinned, unperturbed. 
<: “That’s what I was coming to. Get- 
ting in would be easy, but doing 
■•anything wouldn’t. And neither 
■iwould getting out. But Mart, we’ve 
.[chopped one horn off of the dilem- 
; ma, but we haven’t even touched 
the other. We’ve got to master that 
fourth-dimension rig; and we’re not 
even close. It’s a matter of kind , 
not merely of degree.” 

“I can’t see that. If so, we could 
not have warded off their attack at 
all.” 

“Oh, I didn’t mean the energies 
themselves; it’s the control of that 
much stuff. Synchronization, phasing 
in, combination, and so forth. Get- 
ting such stuff as that closely 
enough together and holding it close- 
ly enough together. Look, Mart. This 
bit that we’ve got left of the Valeron 
is stuffed with machinery practical- 
ly to the skin. She’s so small, rela- 
tively, that you wouldn’t think 
there’d be any trouble meshing in 



machines from various parts of her. 
But there is. Plenty. It never showed 
up before because we never had to 
use a fraction of our total power 
before, but it showed up plenty 
back there. My beam was loose as 
ashes, and I’ve figured out why. 

“Sixth-order stuff moves as many 
times faster than light as> light does 
faster than a snail — maybe j more. 
But it still takes a little time to get 
from one machine to another, inside 
even as small a globe as this is. 
See?” 

Crane frowned in thought. “I see. 
I also see what the difficulties would 
be in anything large enough and 
strong enough to attack the Chlor- 
ans. It would mean timing each 
generator and each element of each 
projector; and each with a permis- 
sible variation of an infinitesimal 
fraction of a microsecond. That, of 
course, means Rovol and Caslor.” 

“I suppose it does . unless we 
can figure out an easier, faster way 
... I don’t know whether the 
Chlorans have got anything like that 
or not, but they’ve got something. 
There ought to be some way of 
snitching it off of them.” 

“Why must they have?” Dunark 
demanded. “It’s probably just a mat- 
ter of size. They have a whole planet 
to fortify. Dozens of ’em if they 
want to. So it doesn’t have to be a 
matter of refinement at all. Just bru- 
tal, piled up, overwhelming power.” 

“Could be,” Seaton agreed. “If so, 
we can’t match it, since the Valeron 
was as big as she could be and still 
have a factor of safety of two point 
two.” He paused in thought, then 
went on, “But with such refine- 



130 



IF 




ment, we could take a planet, no 
matter how loaded it was ... I 
think. So maybe we’d better take off 
for Norlamin, at that.” 

“One thing we should do first, 
perhaps,” Dorothy suggested. “Find 
out what that DuQuesne really did. 
He has me worried.” 

“Maybe we should, at that,” Sea- 
ton agreed. “I’d forgotten all about 
the big black ape.” 

I t was easy enough to find the 
line along which DuQuesne had 
traveled; the plug-chart was proof 
that he had not lied about that. 
They reached without incident the 
neighborhood of the point Du- 
Quesne had marked on the chart. 
Seaton sent out a working projection 
of the device that, by intercepting 
and amplifying light-waves travers- 
ing open space, enabled him actually 
to see events that had happened in 
the not-too distant past. 

He found the scene he wanted. 
He studied it, analyzed and recorded 
it. Then: 

“He lied to me almost a hundred 
and eighty degrees,” Seaton said. 
“That beam came from that galaxy 
over there.” He jerked a thumb. 
“The alien who bothered him was 
in that galaxy. That much I’ll buy. 
But it doesn’t make sense that he’d 
go there. That alien was nobody he 
wanted to monkey with, that’s for 
dead sure. So where did he meet 
the Jelmi, if not in that galaxy?” 
“On the moon, perhaps,” Mar- 
garet said. 

“Possibly. I’ll compute it . no, 
the timing isn’t right — ” Seaton 
thought for a moment — “but there’s 



no use guessing. That galaxy may 
be the first place to look for sign; 
but I’ll bet my case buck it’ll be a 
long, cold hunt. I’d like awfully well 
to have that gizmo — flip bombs 
past the Chlorans’ screens and walls 
with it . .” 

“From a distance greater than 
their working range?” Crane asked. 

“That’s so, too . or maybeso, 
at that, chum. Who knows what you 
can do through the fourth? But it 
looks as though our best bet is to 
beat it to Norlamin, rebuild this 
wreck, and tear into that business 
of refinement of synchronization. So 
say you all?” 

So said they all and Seaton, flip- 
ping on full-power sixth-order drive, 
set course for Norlamin 

A s the student will be aware, the 
events in this climactic struggle 
between the arch-enemies, Seaton 
and DuQuesne, were at this point 
reaching an area of maximum ten- 
sion. It is curious to reflect that the 
outer symptom of this internal dis- 
ruptive stress was, in the case of 
nearly every major component of 
the events to come, a psychological 
state of either satisfied achievement, 
or contented decision, or calm resig- 
nation. It is as though each of the 
major operatives were suffering from 
a universe-wide sense of false tran- 
quility. On Ray-See-Nee, the new 
government felt its problems were 
behind it and only a period of solid, 
rewarding rebuilding lay ahead. (Al- 
though Kay-Lee Barlo had taken 
certain prudent precautions against 
this hope being illusory — as we 
shall see.) The Chlorans, proud and 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



131 




scornful in their absolute supremacy, 
had no nini that Seaton or anyone 
else was making or even proposed 
to make any effective moves against 
them. The Fenachrone, such few 
weary survivors as remained of 
them, had given themselves over to 
— not despair, no; but a proud ac- 
ceptance of the fact that they were 
doomed. 

There was in fact no tranquility 
in store for any of them! But they 
had not yet found that out. 

Meanwhile the Jelmi, for example, 
were just beginning to feel the first 
itch of new challenges. In their big 
new space-rover, the Mallidaxian , 
Savant Tammon was as nearly per- 
fectly happy as it is possible for a 
human or humanoid to be. 
He had made the greatest break- 
through of his career; perhaps the 
greatest breakthrough of all history. 
Exploring its many ramifications 
and determining its many as yet un- 
suspected possibilities would keep 
him busy for the rest of his life. 
Wherefore he was working four- 
teen or fifteen hours every day and 
reveling in every minute of it. He 
hummed happily to himself; occa- 
sionally he burst into song — in a 
voice that was decidedly not of 
grand-operatic quality. 

He had enlarged his private lab- 
oratory by tearing out four store- 
rooms adjoining it; and the whole 
immense room was stacked to the 
ceiling with new apparatus and 
equipment. He was standing on a 
narrow catwalk, rubbing his bristly 
chin with the back of his hand as 
he wondered where he could put 
another two-ton tool, when Mergon 



and Luloy came swinging in; hand 
in hand as usual. Vastly different 
from Tammon, Mergon was not at 
all happy about the status quo. 

“Listen, Tamm!” he burst out. 
“I’ve been yapping at you for a 
week and a half for a decision and 
your time is up as of right now. 
If you don’t pull your head out of 
the fourth dimension and make it 
right now I’ll do it myself and to 
hell with you and your authority as 
Captain-Commander.” 

“Huh? What? Time? Deci- 
sion? What decision?” It was plain 
that the old savant had no idea at 
all of what his first assistant was so 
wrought up about. 

“You set course for Mallidax and 
said we were going back to Malli- 
dax. That’s sheer idiocy and you 
know it. Of all places in the charted 
universe we should not go to, Mal- 
lidax is top and prime. We’re too 
close for comfort already. Even 
though Klazmon must have lost us 
back there in Sol’s system, he cer- 
tainly picked us up again long ago 
and he’d give both wings and all 
his teeth for half the stuff you have 
here,” and Mergon waved both 
arms indicatively around the jam- 
packed room. 

“Oh?” Tammon gazed owlishly at 
the pair. “There was some talk . 
but why should I care where we 
go? This is the merest trifle, Mer- 
gon, and this work is important. 
You will attend to all such mat- 
ters, Mergon. Do not bother me 
with trivia any more,” and Tammoa 
cut communications with them as 
definitely as though he had thrown 
a switch.

Mergon shrugged his shoulders 
and Luloy giggled. “You’re it, boy. 
That’s what you get for sticking 
your neck out. All hail our new 
Captain-Commander!” 

“Well, somebody had to. All our 
necks would have been in slings in 
another week. So pass the word, will 
you, and I’ll skip up to the control 
room and change course.” 

L uloy spread the word; which 
was received with acclaim. 
Practically everybody aboard who 
was anybody agreed with Sennlloy 
when she said, “It’s high time some- 
body took over and Merg’s undoubt- 
edly the best man for the job. 
Tammy’s a nice old dear, but ever 
since he got bitten by that fourth- 
dimension germ he hasn’t known 
what month it is or which way is 
up or within forty million parsecs 
of where he is in space.” 

“You see, Merg?” Luloy crowed, 
when it became evident that the 
shift in command was heartily ap- 
proved. “I wouldn’t even dream of 
ever saying ‘I told you so', but I said 
at the first meeting that you should 
be Captain-Commander, and now 
everybody thinks so, almost.” 

“Yeah, almost,” he agreed; not 
at all enthusiastically. “Everybody 
except the half-wits. Pass the buck. 
Let George do it. Nobody with 
a brain firing on three barrels wants 
the job.” 

“Why, that isn’t so, Merg. You 
know it isn’t!” she protested, indig- 
nantly. 

“Well, / don’t want it,” he broke 
in, “but since Tamm wished it onto 
me I’ll take a crack at it.” 



The Mallidaxian , swinging wide 
and braking down, hard, skirted the 
outermost edge of the Realm; the 
edge farthest away from Llurdiax. 
Mergon did not approach or signal 
to any planet of the Jelmi. Instead, 
he picked out an uninhabited Tellus- 
type planet four solar systems away 
from the Border and landed on it. 
And there, under cover of the sup- 
erdreadnaught’s mighty defensive 
screens and with Captain-Comman- 
der Mergon tensely on watch, the 
engineers and scientists disembark- 
ed, set up their high-order projec- 
tors, and went furiously to work 
building an enormous and enor- 
mously powerful dome. 

The work went on uninterrupted- 
ly, day after day; for so many days 
that both Mergon and Luloy became 
concerned — the girl very highly so. 
“Do you suppose we’ve figured 
wrong?” she asked. 

Mergon frowned. “I can’t be sure, 
of course, but I don’t think so. Pure 
logic, remember. Everything we’ve 
done has been designed to keep 
Klazmon guessing. Off balance. He’s 
fortified Llurdiax, that’s sure, but 
we don’t know how heavily and we 
can’t find out.” He paused. 

“Without using the gizmo, which 
of course is out,” said Luloy. 

“Check. We haven’t sent any spy- 
rays or anything else. They wouldn’t 
have got us anything. But he certain- 
ly expected us to try. He’ll think we 
don’t care . which as a matter 
of fact, we don’t . too much. It’s 
almost a mathematical certainty that 
we can handle anything he can 
throw at us as of now. But if we 
give him time enough to build 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



133 




more really big stuff it’ll be just 
too bad.” 

“And the horrible old monster is 
probably doing just exactly that,” 
Luloy said. 

“I wouldn’t wonder. But we can 
finish the dome before he can build 
enough stuff, and he can’t let that 
happen. Especially since we’re not 
interfering with his prying and spy- 
ing, but are treating him with the 
same contempt he used to treat us. 
That’ll bother him no end. Burn him 
up! Also . remember that stuff 
in the dome that no Llurd can pos- 
sibly understand.” 

Luloy laughed. “Because it isn’t 
anything whatever, really, except 
Llurd-bait? I’m scared that maybe 
they will understand it yet — even 
though I’m sure they won’t.” 

“They can’t. Their minds won’t 
stretch that far in that direction,” 
Mergon said positively. “They knew 
we made a breakthrough, so they’ll 
know that what they see is only a 
fraction of what the thing really is; 
and that’ll scare ’em. As much as 
Llurdi can be scared, that is. Which 
isn’t very much. So Klazmon will 
do something before our dome is 
finished. As I read the tea-leaves, 
he’ll have to.” 

“But just suppose he doesn’t take 
the bait?” 

“Then we’ll have to take the ini- 
tative. I don’t want to — it’d weaken 
our bargaining position tremendous- 
ly — but I will if I have to.” 

H e did not have to. His analysis 
of the Llurdan mentality and 
temperament had been accurate. 
Four full days before the sched- 



uled date of completion of the dome, 
Klazmon’s full working projection 
appeared in the Mallidaxiaris con- 
trol room. Mergon had detected its 
coming, but had done nothing to 
interfere with it. The Llurd quite 
obviously intended parley, not vio- 
lence. 

“Hail, brother llanzlan, Klazmon 
of the Llurdi,” Mergon greeted his 
visitor quietly, but in the phrase- 
ology of one ruler greeting another 
on the basis of unquestionable equal- 
ity. “Is there perhaps some service 
that I, Llanzlan Mergon of the Realm 
of the Jelmi, may perform for you 
and thus place you in my debt?” 

This, to a human dictator, would 
have been effrontery intolerable; but 
Mergon had been pretty sure that 
it would have little or no effect, 
emotionally, upon Klazmon. Nor did 
it; to all seeming it had no effect at 
all. The Llurd merely said, “You 
wish me to believe that you Jelmi 
have made a breakthrough suffic- 
iently important to justify the es- 
tablishment of an independent but 
coexistent Realm of the Jelmi.” 

This was in no sense a question; 
it was a flat statement. Mergon had 
been eminently correct in his as- 
sumption that he would not have lo 
draw the Llurd a blueprint. Mergon 
quirked an eyebrow at Luloy, who 
pressed the button that signaled all 
the savants in the dome to drop 
their tools and dash back into the 
ship. 

“That is correct,” Mergon said. 

Klazmon’s projection remained 
motionless and silent; both Jelmi 
could almost perceive the Llurd’s 
thoughts. And Mergon, who had 



134 



IF 




tracked the Llurd’s thoughts so un- 
erringly so far, was practically cer- 
tain that he was still on track. 

Klazmon did not actually know 
whether the Jelmi had made a 
breakthrough or not. The Jelmi in- 
tended to make him believe that 
they had, and that breakthrough 
was something that made them either 
invulnerable or invincible, or both. 
Any of those matters or assumptions 
could be either true or false. One 
of them, the question of invulner- 
ability, could be and should be test- 
ed without delay If they were in 
fact invulnerable, 10 possible attack 
could harm them. If they were not 
invulnerable they were bluffing and 
lying and should therefore be elimi- 
nated. 

Wherefore Mergon was not sur- 
prised when Klazmon’s projection 
vanished without having said another 
word — nor when, an instant after 
that vanishment, the Mallidaxiaris 
mighty defensive screens Glared 
white. 

They did not even pause at the 
yellow or the yellow-white, but went 
directly to the blinding white; to 
the degree of radiance at which the 
vessel’s spare began automatically to 
cut in — spare after spare after 
spare. 

After staring in silence for two 
long minutes, Mergon said, “We 
figured their most probable maxi- 
mum offense and applied a factor 
of safety of three — and look at 
’em!” 

White-faced, Luloy licked her lips. 
“Mighty Llenderllon!” she cried. 
“How can they possibly deliver such 
an attack ’way out here?” 



Then Mergon picked up his mi- 
crophone and said, “Our screens are 
still holding and they’re protecting 
the dome; but we’re going to need 
a lot more defense. So go back out 
there, please, and give me everything 
you can.” 

He then sat back and stared tight- 
jawed at the ever-climbing needles 
of his meters and at the unchanging 
blinding-white brilliance of his 
vessel’s screens. 

XX 

The Geas 

A s the Llurd’s attack mounted to 
higher and ever higher plateaus 
of fury, Mergon slid along his bench 
to his fourth-dimensional controls 
and there appeared on the floor be- 
side him a lithium-hydride fusion 
bomb, armed and ready. 

He stared at it, his jaw-muscles 
tightening into lumps. Luloy stared 
at the thing, too, and her face be- 
came even paler than it had been. 

“But could you, Merg?” she ask- 
ed, through stiff lips. “I ... I mean, 
you couldn’t, possibly . could 
you?” 

“I don’t know,” he said harshly, 
scarcely separating locked teeth. “I 
may have to whether I can or not. 
We had a factor of safety of three. 
Two point nine of them are in now 
and the last tenth is starting up. The 
dome can’t put out more than that.” 
“I know! But if we blow the 
llanzlanate up, won’t they kill all the 
Jelmi of all our worlds and start 
breeding a more tractable race of 
slaves?” 



136 



IF 




“That’s the way I read it. In that 
case we eight hundred could get 
away clean and start a better civili- 
zation somewhere out of range.” 
She shuddered. “In that case 
would life be worth living?” 

“It’s a tough decision to make . 
since the alternative could be for 
us to kill all the Llurdi.” 

“Oh, no!” she cried. “But don’t 
you think, Merg, that he’ll co- 
operate? They’re absolutely logical, 
you know.” 

“Maybe. In one way I think so, 
but I simply can’t see any absolute 
ruler making such an abject sur- 
render. However, we’ve got to decide 
right now and we’ll have to stick 
to our decision — we both know 
that he can’t be bluffed. If it comes 
right down to it we can do one of 
three things. First, commit suicide 
for our whole eight hundred by not 
touching the bomb off. Second, wipe 
them out. Third, let them wipe out 
all Jelmi except us. What’s your 
vote?” 

“Llenderllon help me! Put that 
way, there’s — oh, look!” she 
screamed , in a miraculously chang- 
ed tone of voice. “The master-meter! 
It’s slowing down! It’s going to stop!” 
She uttered an ear-splitting shriek of 
pure joy and hurled herself into her 
husband’s arms. 

“It’s stabilized, for a fact,” Mer- 
gon said, after their emotions had 
subsided to something approaching 
normal. “He’s throwing everything 
he’s got at us. We’re holding him, 
but just barely, so the question is — ” 
“One thing first,” she broke in. 
“My vote. I hate to say it, but we 
can’t let them kill our race.” 



He put his arm around her and 
squeezed. “That’s what I was sure 
you’d say. The question now is, how 
long do we let him stew in his own 
juice before we skip over there and 
talk peace terms?” 

“Not long enough to let him build 
more generators than we can to fry 
us with,” she replied, promptly if 
a bit unclearly. “One day? Half a 
day? A quarter?” 

“But long enough to let him 
know he’s licked,” Mergon said. 
“I’d say one full day would be just 
about right. So let’s go get us some 
sleep.” 

“Sleep! Llenderllon’s eyeballs! Can 
you even think of such a thing as 
sleep after all this?” 

“Certainly I can. So can you — 
you’re all frazzled out. Come on 
girl, we’re hitting the sheets.” 
“Why, I won’t be able to sleep a 
wink until this is all over!” 

But she was wrong; in ten min- 
utes they were both sleeping the 
sleep of exhaustion. 

T welve hours later she came sud- 
denly awake, rolled over to- 
ward him, and shook him vigorously 
by the shoulder. “Wake up, you!” 
He grumbled something and tried 
to pull away from her grip. 

She shook him again. “Wake up, 
you great big oaf! Suppose that 
beast Klazmon has got more gener- 
ators built -and our screens are all 
failing?” 

He opened one eye. “If they fad, 
sweet, we won’t know a thing about 
it.” He opened the other eye and, 
three-quarters awake now, went on, 
“Do you think I’m running this ship 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE

single-handed? What do you think 
the other officers are for?” 

“But they aren’t you,” she declar- 
ed, with completely feminine illogic 
where her husband was concerned. 
“So hurry up and get up and we’ll 
go see for ourselves.” 

“Okay, but not ’til after breakfast, 
if I have to smack you down. So 
punch us up a gallon of coffee, huh? 
And a couple slabs of ham and six 
or eight eggs? Then we’ll go see.” 

They ate and went and saw. The 
screens still flared at the same blind- 
ing white, but there were no signs 
of overloading or of failure. They 
could, the Third Officer bragged, 
keep it up fof years. Everything was 
under control. 

“You hope,” Mergon said — but 
not to the officer. He said that under 
his breath as he and Luloy turned 
away toward their own station. 

Much to Mergon’s relief, nothing 
happened during the rest of the day, 
and at the end of the twenty-fourth 
hour he sent the actual bomb and 
working projections of himself and 
Luloy into the llanzlanate. Into the 
llanzlan’s private study, where Klaz- 
mon was hard at work. 

It was an immense room, and one 
in which a good anthropologist could 
have worked delightedly for weeks. 
The floor was bare, hard, smooth- 
polished; fantastically inlaid in metal 
and colored quartz and turquoise and 
jade. The pictures — framed mostly 
in extruded stainless steel — portray- 
ed scenes (?) and things (?) and 
events (?) never perceived by any 
Earthly sense and starkly incom- 
prehensible to any Earthly mind. 
The furniture was . “weird” is 



the only possible one- word descrip- 
tion. Every detail of the room pro- 
claimed that here was the private 
retreat of a highly talented and very 
eminent member of a culture that 
was old, wide and high. 

“Hail, Llanzlan Klazmon,” Mer- 
gon said quietly, conversationally. 
“You will examine this bomb, 
please, to make sure that, unlike 
us two, it is actual and practical.” 

T he Llurd’s eyes had bulged a 
little and the tip of his tail 
had twitched slightly at the appari- 
tion. That was all. He picked up 
an instrument with a binocular eye- 
piece, peered through it for a cou- 
ple of seconds, and put it down. “It 
is actual and practical,” he agreed. 

Whatever emotions may have 
been surging through the llanzlan’s 
mind, his control was superb. He 
did not ask them how they had done 
it, or why, or any other question. 
After the event he knew much and 
could guess more — and he was 
perhaps the starkest realist of the 
most starkly realistic race of intelli- 
gent beings yet known to live. 

“You realize, of course, that we 
do not intend to fire it except as the 
ultimately last resort.” 

“I do now.” 

“Ah, yes. Our conduct throughout 
has surprised you; especially that we 
did not counterattack.” 

“If not exactly surprised, at least 
did not anticipate that Jelmi would 
or could act with practically Llurd- 
an logic,” the Llurd conceded. 

“We can. And when we think it 
best, we do. We suggest that you 
cut off your attack. We will then 



138 



IF 




put on air-suits and return here in 
person, to discuss recent develop- 
ments as reasoning and logical en- 
tities should.” 

The Llurd was fast on the uptake. 
He knew that, given time, he could 
crush this threat; but he knew that 
he would not have the time. He 
could see ahead as well as Mergon 
could to the total destruction of two 
hundred forty more planets. Where- 
fore he barked a couple of syllables 
at a com and the furiously incandes- 
cent screens of the Mallidaxian went 
cold and dark. 

Jelmi and bomb disappeared. 
Mergon and Luloy donned gas-tight, 
self-contained, plastic-helmeted cov- 
eralls and reappeared in the Llanz- 
lan’s study. Klazmon seated them 
courteously in two Jelman easy- 
chairs — which looked atrociously 
out of place in that room — and the 
peace conference, which was to last 
for days, began. 

“First,” the llanzlan said, “this 
breakthrough that you have ac- 
complished. At what stage in the 
negotiations do you propose to give 
me the complete technical specifi- 
cations of it.” 

“Now,” Mergon said, and a yard- 
high stack of tapes appeared on the 
floor beside the Llurd’s desk. It was 
the entire' specs and description of 
the fourth-dimensional translator. 
Nothing was omitted or obscured. 

“Oh? I see. There is, then, much 
work yet to be done on it. Work 
that only you Jelmi can do.” 

“That is true, as you will learn 
from those tapes. Now,” said Mer- 
gon, settling down to the bargaining 
session, “first, we have shown you 



that Jelmi capable of doing geniue- 
type work cannot be coerced into 
doing it. Second, the fact is that it 
is psychologically impossible for us 
to do such work under coercion. 
Third, we believe firmly that free 
and independent Jelmi can coexist 
with the Llurdi. Fourth, we believe 
equally firmly that for the best 
good of both races they should so 
coexist ...” 

And at that first day’s end, after 
supper, Luloy said, “Merg, I simply 
would not have believed it. Ever. 
I’m not sure I really believe it now. 
But you know I almost like — I ac- 
tually admire that horrible monster 
in some ways!” 

S eaton called Rovol of Rays, on 
Norlamin, as soon as he could 
reach him. He told him the story 
of what he had done on Ray-See- 
Nee, and what he hoped to gain by 
it, in detail, then went on to ask 
his help on the control of the fourtli- 
dimensional translator. “You see, 
Rovol, at perfect sync it would — 
theoretically — take zero power. I 
don’t expect the unattainable ideal, 
of course — ” he winked at Dor- 
othy — “just close enough so we 
can pack enough stuff into the 
Valeron to handle everything they 
can throw at us and still have 
enough left over to fight back with.* 
“Ah, youth, a fascinating problem 
indeed. I will begin work on it at 
once, and will call in certain others 
in whose provinces some aspects of 
it lie. By the time you arrive here 
we will perhaps have determined 
whether or not any solution is at 
present possible.” 



SKYLARK DuQUESNC

“What?” Seaton yelped. “Why — 
I thought — surely — ” he almost 

stuttered. “I thought you’d have it 
done by then — maybe be sending 
it out to meet us, even.” 

The old Normalinian’s paternal- 
ly forbearing sigh was highly ex- 
pressive. “Still the heedless, thought- 
less youth, in spite of all our 
teachings. You have not studied the 
problem yourself at all.” 

“Well, not very much, I admit.” 
“I advise you to do so. If you de- 
vote to it every period of labor be- 
tween now and your arrival here 
you may perhaps be able to talk 
about it intelligently,” and Rovol 
cut com. 

Dorothy whistled. She didn’t 
whistle very often, but she could do 
it very expressively. 

“Yeah,” Seaton said, ruefully. 
“And the old boy wasn’t kidding, 
either.” 

“Not having a sense of humor, 
he can’t kid. He really slapped you 
on the wrist, friend. But why would 
it be such a horrible job to sync a 
few generators in?” 

“I don’t know, but I’ll find out.” 
He went, worked for four solid 
hours with the Brain, and came back 
wearing a sheepish grin. “It’s true,” 
he reported. “I knew it’d be tricky, 
but I had no idea. You have to work 
intelligently, manipulably and re- 
producibly in time units of three 
times ten to the minus twenty-eighth 
of. a second — the time it takes light 
to travel a billionth of a billionth 
of a centimeter.” 

“Hush. You don’t expect me to 
understand that, do you?” 

“I’ll say I don’t. I don’t expect to 



even really understand it myself.” 

Seaton did not work on the prob- 
lem every day until arrival, but he 
worked on it for over a hundred 
hours — enough so that he began to 
realize how difficult it was. 

The Skylark of Valeron entered 
the Green System, approached Nor- 
lamin, and went into orbit around 
it. The travelers boarded a shuttle, 
which thereupon began to slide down 
a landing-beam toward Rovol’s pri- 
vate dock. 

The little craft settled gently into 
a neoprene-lined cup. The visitors 
disembarked and walked down a 
short flight of metallic steps, at the 
foot of which the ancient, white- 
bearded sage was waiting for them. 
He greeted them warmly — for a 
Normalinian — and led them through 
the “garden” toward the metal-and- 
quartz palace that was his home. 

“Oh, Dick, isn’t it wonderful !” 
Dorothy pressed his arm against her 
side. “It’s so much like Orion’s and 
yet so different . .” 

And it was both. The acreage of 
velvet-short, springy grass was about 
the same as that upon which they 
had landed so long before. The im- 
perishable-metal statuary was sim- 
ilar. Here also were the beds of 
spectacular flowers and the hedges 
and sculptured masses of gorgeous- 
ly vari-colored plant life. The tap- 
estry wall, however — composed of 
millions upon millions of independ- 
ently moving, flashing, self-lumin- 
ous jewels of all the colors of the 
rainbow — ran for a good three hun- 
dred yards beside the walk. It was 
evident that the women of the Rovol 
had been working on it for hundreds 



140 



IF 




of centuries instead of for mere 
hundreds of years. Instead of being 
only form and color, as was the wall 
of the Orion, it was well along to- 
ward portraying the entire history of 
the Family Rovol. 

Rovol wanted to entertain his 
guests instead of work, but Seaton 
objected. “Shame on you, Rovol. 
The Period of Labor is just start- 
ing, and remember how you fellows 
used to bat my ears down about 
there being definite and non-inter- 
changeable times for work and for 
play and so forth?” 

“That is of course true, youth,” 
Rovol agreed, equably enough. “I 
should not have entertained the idea 
for a moment. My companion will 
welcome the ladies and show them 
to your apartments. We will pro- 
ceed at once to the Area of Experi- 
ment,” and he called an aircar by 
fingering a stud at his belt. 

“I’ve been studying, as you sug- 
gested,” Seaton said then. “Can the 
thing be solved? The more I worked 
on it the more dubious I got.” 

“Yes, but the application of its 
solution will be neither easy nor 
simple.” The aircar settled gently 
to the walk a few yards ahead of 
the party and Rovol and Seaton 
boarded it;. Rovol still talking. “But 
you will be delighted to know that, 
thanks to your gift of the metal of 
power, what would have been a work 
of lifetimes can very probably be ac- 
complished in a few mere years.” 
Seaton was not delighted. Know- 
ing what Rovol could mean by the 
word “few”, he was appalled; but 
there was nothing whatever he could 
do to speed things up. 



r ye spent a couple of weeks re- 
1 building the Skylark of Val - 
eron — with batteries of offensive 
and defensive weaponry where single 
machines had been — then stood 
around and watched the Normalin- 
ians work. And as day followed day 
without anything being accomplished 
he became more and more tense 
and impatient. He concealed his 
feelings perfectly, he thought; but 
he should have known that he could 
hide nothing from the extremely 
percipient mind of the giri who was 
in every respect his other half. 

“Dick, you’ve been jittering like a 
witch,” she said one evening, 
“about something I can’t see any 
reason for. But you have a reason, 
or you wouldn’t be doing it. So 
break down and tell me.” 

“I can’t, confound it. I know 
I’m always in a rush to get a thing 
done, but not like this. I’m all of a 
twitter inside. I can’t sleep . .” 
Dorothy snickered. “You can’t? 
If what you were doing last night 
wasn’t sleeping it was the most reas- 
onable facsimile thereof I’ve ever 
seen. Or heard.” 

“Not like I ought to, I mean. 
Nightmares. Devils all the time 
sticking me with pitchforks. Do you 
believe in hunches?” 

“No,” she said, promptly. 4 T 
never had any. Not a one.” 

“I never did, either, and if this is 
one I never want to have another. 
But it could be a hunch that we 
ought to be investigating that alien 
galaxy of DuQuesne’s. Whatever it 
is, I want to go somewhere and I 
haven’t the faintest idea where.” 
“Oh? Listen!” Dorothy’s eyes 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



141 




widened. “Ill bet you’re getting an 
answer to that message we sent out!” 

He shook his head. “Uh-uh. Can’t 
be. Telepathy has got to be some- 
thing you can understand.” 

“Who besides you ever said it 
would have to be telepathy? And 
who knows what telepathy would 
have to be like? Come on, let’s go 
tell Martin and Peggy!” 

“Huh?” he yelped. “Tell M. Rey- 
nolds Crane, the hardest-boiled 
skeptic that ever went unhung, that 
I want to go skyshooting to hellan- 
gone off into the wild blue yonder 
just because I’ve got an itch that I 
can’t scratch?” 

“Why not?” She looked him 
steadily in the eye. “We’re explor- 
ing terra incognita , Dick. How much 
do you really know about that mind 
of yours, the way it is now?” 

“Okay. Maybe they’ll buy it; you 
did. Let’s go.” 

They went; and, a little to Seaton’s 
surprise, Crane agreed with Dor- 
othy. So did Margaret. Hence three 
hours later, the big sky-rover was on 
her way. 

Four days out, however, Seaton 
said, “This isn’t the answer, I don’t 
think. The itch is still there. So 
what?” 

There was silence for a couple 
of minutes, then Dorothy chuckled 
suddenly. Sobering quickly, she said, 
with a perfectly straight face, “I’ll 
bet it’s that new department head 
girl-friend of yours. Dick; the pistol- 
packing mama with the wiggle. She 
wants to see the big, bold, handsome 
Earthman again. And if it is, I’ll 
scratch . .” 

Seaton jumped almost out of his 



chair. “You’re not kidding . half as 
much as you think you are, pet. 
That crack took a good scratch at 
exactly where it itches.” He put on 
his remote-control helmet and 
changed course. “And that helps 
still more.” He thought for minutes, 
then shrugged his shoulders and 
said, “I’m not getting a thing . 
not anything more at all. How many 
of you remember either Ree-Toe 
Prenk or the girl well enough to 
picture either of them accurately in 
your minds?” 

They all remembered one or both 
of the Rayseenians. 

“Okay. This’ll sound silly. It is 
silly, for all the tea in China, but 
let’s try something. All join hands, 
picture either or both of them, and 
think at them as hard as we can. 
The thought is simply ‘we’re com- 
ing.’ Okay?” 

More than half sheepishly, they 
tried it — and it worked. At least 
Seaton said, “Well, it worked, I 
guess. Anyway, for the first time in 
weeks, it’s gone. But I didn’t get a 
thing. Nothing whatever. Not even 
a hint either that we were being 
paged or that our reply was being 
received. Did any of you?” 

None of them had. 

“Huh!” Seaton snorted. “If this 
is telepathy they can keep it — I’ll 
take Morse’s original telegraph!” 

A week or so after the Skylark of 
Valeron left the neighborhood 
of Ray-See-Nee, that planet’s new 
government began to have trouble. 
Ree-Toe Prenk had said and had be- 
lieved that whoever controlled the 
capital controlled the world, but that 



142 



IF 




was not true in his case. It had al- 
ways been true previously because 
the incoming powers had always 
been of the same corrupt-to-the-core 
stripe as those who were ousted — 
and when corruption has been the 
way of life for generations it is 
deep-rooted indeed. 

There were, of course, other fac- 
tors behind the unrest. But neither 
Prenk nor any other human knew 
about them — then. 

All the district bosses had always 
gone along with the Big Boss as a 
matter of course. Not one of them 
cared a whit who ran the world, as 
long as his own privileges and per- 
quisites and powers and takes were 
not affected. Prenk, however, was 
strictly honest and strictly just. If 
he should succeed in taking over 
Ray-See-Nee’s government in full, 
every crook and boodler on the 
planet would lose everything he had; 
possibly even his life. Thus, while 
the new Premier held the capital — 
in a rapidly deteriorating grip — his 
influence outside that city’s limits 
varied inversely as about the fourth 
power of the distance. 

This resistance, while actual 
enough, was in no sense overt. Every 
order was ostensibly obeyed to the 
letter; but everything deteriorated 
at an accelerating rate and Prenk 
could do nothing whatever about it. 
Whenever and wherever Prenk was 
not looking, business went on as us- 
ual — gambling, drugs, prostitution, 
crime and protection — but he could 
not prove any of it. Neither uni- 
formed police nor detectives could 
find anything much amiss. They 
made arrests, but no suspect was 



ever convicted. The prosecution’s 
cases were weak. The juries brought 
in verdicts of “innocent”, usually 
without leaving the box. 

Even when, in desperation, Prenk 
went — supposedly top-secretly — to 
an outlying city, fully prepared to 
stage a questioning that would have 
made Torquemada blush, he did 
nothing and he learned nothing. Ev- 
ery person on his list had vanished 
tracelessly and every present in- 
cumbent had abundant proof of r\- 
nocence. Nor did any of them know 
why they had been promoted so sud- 
denly. They were just lucky, they 
guessed. 

It was indeed baffling. It would 
have been less so if Prenk had had 
any notion of the universe-wide stir 
of mighty events just beginning to 
bubble — if he had been able, as we 
are now able, to fit together afl 
these patchwork stories into one 
nearly Norlaminian fabric of univer- 
sal history. 

But he wasn’t — and, for his peace 
of mind, perhaps that was just M 
well! 

P remier Ree-Toe Prenk sat at his 
desk in the Room of State. 
Kay-Lee Barlo, shapely legs crossed 
and pistol at hip, sat at his left. Sy- 
By Takeel, the new Captain-General 
of the Guard, stood at ease at his 
right. 

“Whoever is doine this is a smooth, 
shrewd operator,” Prenk said. “So 
much so that you two are the only 
people I can trust. And I don’t sup- 
pose either of you will ever be ap- 
proached. Probably neither of you 
would be bought even if you offered 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



143 




yourselves ever so deftly for sale.” 
“I wouldn’t be, certainly,” Takeel 
said. “Captains-General of mercen- 
aries don’t sell out. I wouldn’t an- 
swer for any of my lieutenants, 
though, if there’s loot to be had. 
There is here, I take it?” 

“Unlimited quantities, apparent- 
ly. So you, too, are subject to ass- 
assination?” 

The soldier shrugged. “Oh, yes, 
it’s an occupational hazard. How 
about you. Exalted Barlo? No 
chance either, I’d say?” 

“None at all. My stand is too well 
known. Half my people would stab 
me in the back if they dared to and 
they all look me in the eye and lie 
in their Mi-Ko-Ta-cursed teeth. I 
wish Ky-El Mokak and his people 
would get back here quick,” Takeel 
said wistfully. 

“So do I,” Prenk said, glumly. 
“But even if we had a sixth-order 
tightbeamer and could use it, we 
haven’t the slightest idea of where 
he came from or where he went to.” 
“That’s true.” She nibbled at her 
lip. “But listen. I’m a psychic. It 
runs in the women of some families, 
you know, being . well, what 
most people call witches, kind of. 
My talent isn’t fully developed yet, 
but mother and I together could 
witch-wish at him to come back here 
as fast 3s he can and I’m sure he 
would.” 

The soldier’s face showed quite 
plainly what he thought of the idea, 
but Prenk nodded — if more than 
somewhat dubiously. “I’ve heard of 
that ‘witch-wishing’ business, and 
that it sometimes works. So go home 
right now and get at it, Kay-Lee, 



and give it everything you -and 
your mother both can put out.” 

Kay-Lee went home forthwith and 
went into executive session with her 
mother; a handsome, black-haired 
woman of forty-odd. “And I have 
positive identification,” the girl con- 
cluded. “His blood was all over the 
place — positively quarts of it — and 
I saved some just in case.” And, of 
course, she had — prudently, wisely 
and, as it turned out, luckily for 
all concerned! 

The older woman’s face cleared. 
“That’s good. Without a positive, 
I’m afraid it would be hopeless at 
what the distance probably is by 
this time. Run and get the witch- 
holly, dear, while I fix the incense.” 

They each ate seven ritually pre- 
served witch-holly berries and in- 
haled seven deep drafts of aromatic 
smoke. While they were waiting for 
the powerful drugs to take effect, 
Kay-Lee asked, “How much of this 
rigamarole is chemistry, do you 
suppose, mother, and how much is 
just hocus-pocus?” 

“No one knows. Some day, what- 
ever it is that we have will be rec- 
ognized as having existence and will 
be really studied. Until then, all we 
can do is follow the ancient rit- 
ual.” 

“I think I’ll talk to Ky-El about 
it. But listen. Witches with any 
claim at all to decency simply don’t 
put geases on people. But what if 
he’s so far away that we can’t reach 
him any other way?” 

The older woman frowned, then 
said, “In that case, my dear, we’ll 
never, never tell anyone a thing 
about it.”

XXI 

Re-Seating of the Premier 

A s the Skylark of Valeron ap- 
proached Galaxy DW-427-LU, 
Dorothy said, “Dick, I suppose it’s 
occurred to you more than once 
that I’m not much of a woman.” 
“You aren’t? I’d say you’d do un- 
til the real thing showed up.” Sea- 
ton, who had been thinking of the 
problem of synchronization instead 
of his wife, changed voice instantly 
when he really looked at her and 
saw what a black mood she was in. 
“You’re the universe’s best, is all, 
ace. I knew you were feeling a 
little low in your mind, but not . 
listen, sweetheart. What could pos- 
sibly make you think you aren’t the 
absolute top?” 

She did not answer the question. 
Instead, “What do you think you’re 
going to get into this time?” 
“Nothing much, I’m sure. Prenk’s 
probably running out of ammuni- 
tion. We can make more in five 
minutes than he can in five years.” 
“I’m sure that isn’t it. You’re go- 
ing into personal danger again and 
I’ll be expected to sit up here in 
the Skylark eating my heart out 
wondering if you’re alive or dead. 
You don’t see Sitar going through 
that with Dunark.” 

“Wait up, sweetheart. Mores and 
customs, remember?” 

“Mores and customs be damned! 
Do you remember exactly what Si- 
tar said and exactly how she said 
it? Did it sound like mores and cus- 
toms to you? Was there any element 
whatever of suttee in it?” 



“But listen, Dottie — ” He took 
her gently in his arms. 

“You listen!” she rushed on. “If 
he dies she doesn’t want to keep on 
living and she won’t. And she 
doesn’t care who knows it. Maybe 
it started that way — society’s sanc- 
tion — but that was her personal 
profession of faith. And I feel the 
same way. If you die I don’t want 
to keep on living and won’t. So next 
time I’m going with you.” 

Being an American male, he could 
not accept that without an argu- 
ment. “But there’s Dickie,” he said. 

“There are also her three children 
on Osnome. I learned something 
from her about what the basic, rock- 
bottom attitude of a woman toward 
her man ought to be. Even from 
little Lotus. She’s no bigger than a 
minute and a half, but what did she 
do? So while we’re having this mo- 
ment of truth let’s be rock-bottom 
honest with each other for the first 
time in our lives instead of mouth- 
ing the platitudes of our society. 
I’m not a story-book mother, Dick. 
If it ever comes right down to a 
choice, you know how I’ll decide — 
and how long it will take!” 

S eaton could not get in touch with 
Ree-Toe Prenk, of course, un- 
til the Valeron was actually inside 
Galaxy DW-427-LU; but as soon as 
communication could be established 
Kay-Lee Barlo asked eagerly; “You 
did get our thought, then, Ky-El? 
Mother’s and mine? We didn’t feel 
that we were quite reaching you.” 
“Not exactly,” Seaton replied. 
“I didn’t get any real thought at 
all; just a feeling that I ought to be 



SKYLARK DuQUESNf 



145 




going somewhere that bothered me 
no end until I headed this way. But 
since it was you people calling, I’m 
mighty glad I got what little I did.” 

The Skylark went into orbit 
around Ray-See-Nee and the Sky- 
larkers climbed into a landing-craft 
that Seaton had designed and built 
specifically for the occasion. It was 
a miniature battleship — one of the 
deadliest fighting ships of its size 
and heft ever built. And this time 
the whole party was heavily armed. 
Dunark and Sitar were in full Os- 
nomian panoply of war. Dorothy 
wore a pair of her long-barrelled 
.38 target pistols in leg-holsters un- 
der her bouffant skirt. Even little 
Lotus wore two .25 automatics. “I 
don’t know whether I can hit any- 
body with one of these or not,” she 
had said while Dorothy was rigging 
her. “I’d much rather work hand to 
hand. But if they’re too far away to 
get at I can at least make a lot of 
noise and look like I’m doing some- 
thing.” 

They were met at the spaceport 
by two platoons of the Premier’s 
Guard, led by Captain-General Sy- 
By Takeel himself. They were 
guarded like visiting royalty from 
the spaceport to the Capitol Build- 
ing and up into the Room of State, 
where they were greeted with infor- 
mal cordiality by Prenk and by Kay- 
Lee, who was now an Exalted of the 
Thirty-Fifth, besides being First 
Deputy Premier. 

Prenk seated his guests, not on 
stools in front of and below his 
throne-like desk, but at a long con- 
ference table with Seaton at its head. 
The two lieutenants posted guards 



outside the two immense doors at 
the far end of the vast room and 
stationed the rest of their men in 
position to cover both entrances. 
Takeel, with velvet slippers over his 
field-boots, stood on Prenk’s desk, 
commanding the entire room, with 
a machine-gun-like weapon cradled 
expertly and accustomedly in the 
crook of his left arm. 

“Are things this bad?” Seaton 
asked. “I knew it was tough when 
you told us to come loaded for 
bear — but this?" 

“They’re exactly this bad. These 
two — ” Prenk jerked a thumb at 
Kay-Lee and at Takeel — “are the 
only two people on this whole world 
that I know I can trust. Until quite 
recently I was sure I held the city 
— but now I’m not at all sure of 
holding even this building. I can 
only hope that you’re not too late. 
I’ll tell you what the situation is; 
then you will tell me, please, if 
there is anything you can do about 
it.” 

He talked for twelve minutes. 
Then : 

“P-s-s-s-st!” Kay-Lee hissed. “Dan- 
ger! Coming — nearing us — fast! I 
can feel it — taste it — smell it! Get 
ready quick!” She sprang to her 
feet, drew her pistol, and arranged a 
dozen clips of cartridges meticu- 
lously on the table in front of her. 

The Osnomians’ chairs crashed 
backward, their heavy coats flew 
off, and they stood tensely ready, 
machine pistols in all four hands. 
And, seconds later, the other Sky- 
larkers were on their feet and ready 
too. The Captain-General had not 
heard the low-voiced warning, but 



146 



IF 




he had seen the action and that was 
enough. Trigger-nerved Dunark’s 
chair had no sooner struck the floor 
on its first bounce than Takeel was 
going into his shooting stance, with 
his weapon flipping around into fir- 
ing position as though it were sliding 
in a greased groove; the while glaring 
ferociously at his senior lieutenant — 
who thereupon began to have an 
acute attack of the jitters. 

I t was the commander’s savage 
motion, actually, that ruined the 
attackers’ split-second schedule. 
For, at a certain second, the two 
lieutenants were to shoot their cap- 
tain; then to shoot Prenk and Kay- 
Lee Barlo; and then, as the attack 
proper was launched, they were to 
kill as many of their own men as 
they could. Thus, knowing what a 
savage performer the Captain-Gen- 
eral was with his atrocious weapon, 
their hands were forced; they had to 
act a couple of seconds too soon. 
They tried — but with two short 
bursts so close together as to be 
practically one, Takeel cut them 
down. Cut them both almost liter- 
ally in two. 

Thus, when the two great doors 
were blasted simultaneously down 
and the attackers stormed in with 
guns ablaze, they did not find a 
half-dead and completely demoraliz- 
ed Guard and a group of surprised 
visitors. Instead: 

The mercenaries were neither dead 
nor demoralized. They knew exactly 
what to do and were doing it. Dun- 
ark and Sitar had the fire-power of 
half a company of trained troops 
and were using it to the fullest full. 



The Captain-General, from his coign 
of vantage atop the desk, was spray- 
ing both entrances with bullets like 
a gardener watering two flower- 
beds with a hose. Kay-Lee was 
throwing lead almost as fast as 
Takeel was; changing magazines 
with such fluent speed and precision 
as to miss scarcely a shot. Dorothy, 
nostrils flaring and violet eyes blaz- 
ing, was shooting as steadily and as 
accurately as though she were out 
on the range marking up another 
possible. Even tiny Lotus, with one 
of her .25’s clutched in both hands, 
was shooting as fast as she could 
pull the trigger. 

It was Seaton, however, who end- 
ed the battle. He waited long enough 
to be absolutely sure of what was 
going on, then fired twice with his 
left-hand magnum — through the 

doorways, high over the heads of the 
attackers, far down the corridors. 

There were two terrific explos- 
ions; followed by one long rumbling 
crash as that whole section of the 
building either went somewhere else 
or collapsed into rubble. Falling and 
flying masonry and steel and razor- 
edged shards of structural glass 
killed almost everyone outside the 
heavily reenforced wall of the Room 
of State. The shock-waves of the 
blasts, raging through the doorways, 
killed half of the enemy massed 
there and blew the others half the 
length of the room' And, continuing 
on with rapidly decreasing force, 
knocked most of the Skylarkers flat 
and blew the Captain-General off 
of the desk and clear back against 
the wall. 

“Sangram’s head!” that worthy 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



147 




yelled, scrambling to his feet with 
machine-gun again — or still? He had 
not for an instant lost control of 
thatl — at the ready. “What in Jap- 
nonk’s rankest hell was that?” 
“X-plosive shell,” Seaton said, his 
voice as hard as his eyes. “This time 
I came loaded for bear. Now we’ll 
mop up and find out what’s been go- 
ing on. I gather, sir, that your two 
platoon leaders were in on it?” 
“Yes. It’s a shame I had to kill 
’em without asking ’em a few ques- 
tions.” He did not explain that he 
had had neither the time in which 
nor the weapon with which merely 
to wound them seriously enough so 
that neither of them could fight 
back with any sort of weapon. 
There was no need. 

“That won’t make too much dif- 
ference.” Seaton looked around; 
first at his own crew and tKen at 
the guards, half of whom were 
down. Medics and first-aid men 
were rushing in to work on them. 
He looked again, more closely, at 
his people and at Prenk and Kay- 
Lee. Not one of them, apparently, 
had even been scratched. 

T hat, however, was logical. The 
mercenaries were hard-trained 
fighting men, shooting was their 
business. Hence the attackers’ or- 
ders had been to shoot the guards 
first, and there had been no time 
to evaluate the actual situation and 
to change the plan of attack. 
Hence, as far as anyone knew, not 
a single bullet had been aimed at 
the far end of the room. 

Seaton took a pair of headsets 
out of his pocket and applied one 



of them, first to one of the two 
lieutenants* heads, then to the other. 

“Uh-huh,” he grunted then. “That 
ape didn’t know too much, but this 
one was going to be the new cap- 
tain-general. I suppose you’ve got a 
recorder, Ree-Toe?” 

“I’ll get it, sir!” Kay-Lee ex- 
claimed; and Prenk, eyes bulging, 
gasped: 

“Don’t tell me you can read a 
dead brain, sir!” 

“Oh, yes. They keep their charg- 
es, sometimes for days.” Kay-Lee 
handed Seaton a microphone then, 
and he spoke into it for ten min- 
utes — the while three Rayseenian 
faces went through gamuts of emo- 
tion; each culminating in the same 
expression of joyous satisfaction. 

When Seaton paused for breath 
Prenk said in awe, “That machine 
is certainly a something ... I don’t 
suppose . .” He stopped. 

“I do suppose, yes. I’ll give you 
a few sets, with blueprints, and show 
you how they work,” and Seaton 
went on with his reading. 

A few minutes later he cut off the 
mike and said, “That ape over 
there,” he pointed, “is one of the 
Big Wheels. Have someone latch on- 
to him, Ree-Toe; we’ll read him 
next. He’s one you’ll be really in- 
terested in, so I’ll hook you up in 
parallel with me so you can get 
everything he knows into your own 
brain.” He took a third headset from 
his pocket and began to adjust its 
settings, going on, “It takes a dif- 
ferent set-up . so . and goes 
on your head so.” 

“That ape” was a fattish, sallow- 
faced man of fifty, who had been 



148 



IF 




directing operations from outside 
the room and had intended to stay 
outside it until everything was secure 
within. He had been blown into the 
room and halfway along its length 
by the force of the blasts. He was 
pretty badly smashed up, but he was 
beginning to regain consciousness 
and was weakly trying to get to his 
feet. 

This unlucky wight was a mine 
of information indeed, but Prenk 
stopped the mining operation after 
only a couple of minutes of dig- 
ging. 

“Sy-By,” he said. “Two more of 
your officers you can shoot.” he 
gave two names. “Then come back 
here with some men you think you 
can trust and we’ll test ’em to make 
sure. By that time I’ll have a list of 
people for you to round up and 
bring in for examination.” 

There is no need to follow any 
farther the Premier’s progress in 
cleaning up his planet. In fact, only 
one more incident that occurred 
there is of interest here — one that 
occurred while Seaton and Dorothy 
were getting ready for bed in one 
of the suites of honor. She put 
both arms around him suddenly; he 
pressed her close. 

“Dick, I belonged there. Beside 
you. Every fiber of my being be- 
longed there. That was exactly where 
I belonged.” ' 

“I know you did, sweet. I’ll have 
to admit it. But . .” 

She put her hand over his mouth. 
“But nothing, my dearest. No buts. 
I’ve killed rats and rattlesnakes, and 
that wasn’t any different. Not a 
bit different in any way.” 



O f the more than five thousand 
Fenachrone who had left their 
noisome home planet in Sleemet'a 
flagship, almost seven hundred had 
died and more were dying. 

It was not that the Llurdi were 
physically cruel to them or abused 
them in any way. They didn’t. Nor 
were they kind; they were conspicu- 
ously and insultingly neutral and in- 
different to them. Conspicuous and 
insulting, that is, to the hypersensi- 
tive minds of the captives. In their 
own minds, the Llurdi were acting 
strictly according to logic. Every 
item of the subjects' environment 
duplicated precisely its twin on the 
subjects’ home world. What more 
could logically be done? Nothing. 

The Llurdi observed the mental 
anguish of the Fenachrone, of 
course, and recorded their emotions 
quite accurately, but with no emo- 
tional reactions whatever of their 
own. Practically all emotions were 
either illogical or unsane, or both. 

To the illogical and unsane Fena- 
chrone, however — physically, men- 
tally, intellectually and psycholog- 
ically — the situation was intolerable; 
one that simply could not be en- 
dured. 

They were proud, haughty, intol- 
erant; their race had always been 
so. Since time immemorial it had 
been bred into their innermost con- 
sciousnesses that they were the 
RACE SUPREME — destined un- 
questionably to be the absolute rulers 
of all things living or yet to live 
throughout all the transfinite reaches 
of the Cosmic All. 

Holding this belief with every 
fiber of their beings, they had been 



150 



IF 




plunged instantly into a condition 
of complete, utter helplessness. 

Their vessel could not fight. While 
it was intact except for its tail-sec- 
tion and its power-pods, its every 
offensive projector was burned out; 
useless. Nor could they fight pers- 
onally, either physically or mental- 
ly. Their physical strength, enor- 
mous as it was, was of no avail 
against tractors and pressors of pure 
force; their hardest-driven hypnotic 
glares were of no avail against the 
completely logical, completely mat- 
ter-of-fact minds of the Llurdi. 

Most galling condition of all, the 
Fenachrone were not treated as 
enemies; nor as menaces or threats; 
nor even as intelligent entities whose 
knowledges and abilities might be 
worthy of notice. These things were 
observed and recorded, to be sure, 
but only as component parts of a 
newly discovered class of objects, 
the Fenachrone; a class of objects 
that happened to be alive. The Fen- 
achrone were neither more nor less 
noteworthy than were birds or bar- 
nacles. 

Sleemet, no longer young and 
perhaps the proudest and most in- 
tractable and most intransigent of 
the lot, could not endure that treat- 
ment very long; but he did not 
bend. The old adage “Where there’s 
life there’s hope,” simply is not 
true where such as the Llurdi and 
the Fenachrone are concerned. Slee- 
met lost all hope and broke; broke 
almost completely down. 

He stopped eating. That did not 
bother the Llurdi in any way. Why 
should it? They were neither 
squeamish nor humane, any more 



than they were cruel or vindictive. 
The fact that certain of these creat- 
ures stopped taking nourishment 
under certain conditions was merely 
a datum to be observed and record- 
ed. 

But since Sleemet was big and 
strong, even for a Fenachrone, and 
had previously eaten very well in- 
deed, it took him a long time to 
die. And as he weakened — as the 
bindings between flesh and spirit 
loosened more and ever more — he 
regressed more and ever more back 
into the youth of his race. Back and 
back. Still farther back; back into 
its very childhood; back to a time 
when his remote ancestors ate their 
meat alive and communicated with 
each other, sometimes by grunts and 
gestures, but more often by means 
of a purely mental faculty that was 
later to evolve into the power of 
ocular hypnosis. 

Half conscious or less of his sur- 
roundings but knowing well that 
death was very near, Sleemet half- 
consciously sent out his race’s ages- 
old mental message-in-extremity of 
the dying. 

M arc C. DuQuesne knew vastly 
more about the Fenachrone 
than did any other man alive, not 
excluding Richard Seaton. He and 
Seaton were, as far as is known, 
the only two men ever to meet Fen- 
achrone mind to mind and live 
through the experience; but Du- 
Quesne had been in thought-helmet 
contact with a Fenachrone much 
longer and much more intimately 
and very much more interestedly 
than Seaton ever had — because of

•51 




the tremendous intrinsic differences 
between the personalities of the 
two men. 

Seaton, after having crippled a 
war-vessel of the Fenachrone, had 
pinned its captain against a wall with 
so many beams of force that he 
could not move his head and could 
scarcely move any other part of his 
monstrous body. Then, by means of 
a pair of thought-helmets, he had 
taken what of that captain’s knowl- 
edge he wanted. He had, however, 
handled that horribly unhuman brain 
very gingerly. He had merely read 
certain parts of it, as one reads an 
encyclopedia; at no time had his 
mind become en rapport with that 
of the monster. In fact, he had said 
to Crane: 

“I’d hate to have much of that 
brain in my own skull — afraid I’d 
bite myself. I’m just going to look 
. and when I see something I 
want I’ll grab it and put it into my 
own brain.” 

DuQuesne, however, in examin- 
ing a navigating engineer of that 
monstrous race, had felt no such 
revulsion, contrariwise — although 
possibly not quite consciously — he 
had admired certain traits of Fena- 
chrone character so much that he 
had gone en rapport with that engi- 
neer’s mind practically cell to cell; 
with the result that he had emerged 
from that mental union as nearly a 
Fenachrone himself as a human 
being could very well become. 

Wherefore, as DuQuesne in his 
flying-planetoid-base approached the 
point of its course nearest to the 
planet Llurdiax, he began to feel the 
thinnest possible tendril of thought 



trying to make contact with one of 
the deepest chambers of his mind. 
He stiffened; shutting it off by using 
automatically an ability that he had 
not known consciously that he had. 
He relaxed; and, all interest now, 
tuned his mind to that feeler of 
thought, began to pull it in, and 
stopped — and the contact released 
a flood of Fenachrone knowledge 
completely new to him. 

A Fenachrone, dying somewhere, 
wanted . wanted what? Not 
help, exactly. Notice? Attention? To 
give something? DuQuesne was not 
enough of a Fenachrone to translate 
that one thought even approximate- 
ly, and he was not interested enough 
to waste any time on it. It had 
something to do with the good of 
the race; that was close enough. 

DuQuesne, frowning a little, sat 
back in his bucket seat and thought. 
He had supposed that the Fena- 
chrone were all dead . but it 
made sense that Seaton couldn’t have 
killed all of a space-faring race, at 
that. But so what? He didn’t care 
how many Fenachrone died. But a 
lot of their stuff was really good, 
and he certainly hadn’t got it all yet, 
by any means; it might be smart to 
listen to what the dying monster had 
to say — especially since he, Du- 
Quesne, was getting pretty close to 
the home grounds of Klazmon the 
Llurd. 

Wherefore DuQuesne opened his 
mental shield: and, since his mind 
was still tuned precisely to the quest- 
ing wave and since the DQ was now 
practically as close to Llurdiax as it 
would get on course 255U, he re- 



152 



IF 




ceived a burst of thought that jarred 
him to the very teeth. 

It is amazing how much informa- 
tion can be carried by a Fenachrone- 
compressed burst of thought. It was 
fortunate for DuQuesne that he had 
the purely Fenachrone abilities to 
decompress it, to spread it out and 
analyze it, and later, to absorb it 
fully. 

The salient points, however, were 
pellucidly clear. The dying monster 
was First Scientist Fleet Admiral 
Sleemet; and he and more than 
four thousand other Fenachrone 
were helpless captives of and were 
being studied to death by Llurdan 
scientists under the personal direc- 
tion of Llanzlan Klazmon. 

Realizing instantly what that 
meant — Klazmon would be out here 
in seconds with a probe, if nothing 
stronger — DuQuesne slammed on 
full-coverage screens at full power, 
thus sealing his entire worldlet 
bottle-tight against any and every 
spy-ray, beam, probe, band, zone of 
force and/or order of force that he 
knew anything about. Since this in- 
cluded everything he had known 
before this trip began, plus every- 
thing he had learned from Freemind 
One and from the Jelmi and from 
Klazmon himself, he was grimly cer- 
tain that he was just as safe as 
though he were in God’s hip pocket 
from any possible form of three- 
dimensional observation or attack. 

Cutting in his fourth-dimensional 
gizmo — how glad he was that he 
had studied it so long and so inten- 
sively that he knew more about it 
than its inventors did! — he flipped 
what he called its “eye” into the 



Fenachrone Reservation or distant 
Llurdiax. He seized Sleemet, bed and 
all, in a wrapping of force and de- 
posited the bundle gently on the 
floor of the DQ’s control room, prac- 
tically at his, DuQuesne’s feet. Fena- 
chrone could breathe Earth air for 
hours without appreciable damage — 
they had proved that often enough 
— and if he decided to keep any of 
them alive he’d make them some air 
they liked better. 

Second, he brought over a doctor, 
complete with kit and instruments 
and supplies; and third, the Fena- 
chrone equivalent of a registered 
nurse. 

“You, doctor!” DuQuesne snap- 
ped, in Fenachronian. “I don’t know 
whether this spineless weakling is 
too far gone to save or not. Or 
whether he is worth saving or not. 
But since he was actually in charge 
of your expedition-to-preserve-the- 
race I will listen to what he has to 
say instead of blasting him out of 
hand. So give him a shot of the 
strongest stuff you have — or is he 
in greater need of food than of sti- 
mulant?” 

DuQuesne did not know whether 
the doctor would cooperate with a 
human being or not. But he did — 
whether from lack of spirit of his 
own or from desire to save his chief, 
DuQuesne did not care enough to 
ask. 

“Both,” the doctor said, “but 
nourishment first, by all means. In- 
travenous, nurse, please,” and doc- 
tor and nurse went to work with 
the skill and precision of their high- 
ly trained crafts. 

And, somewhat to DuQuesne’s 

153 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 




surprise, Sleemet began immediate- 
ly to rally; and in three-quarters of 
an hour he had regained full con- 
sciousness. 

CiXTou spineless worm!” Du- 
ll Quesne shot at the erst- 
while invalid, in true Fenachrone 
tone and spirit. “You gutless won- 
der! You pusillanimous weakling, 
you sniveling coward! Is it the act of 
a noble of the Fenachrone to give 
up, to yield supinely, to surrender 
ignominiously to a fate however 
malign while a spark of life en- 
dures?” 

Sleemet was scarcely stirred by 
this vicious castigation. He raised 
dull eyes — eyes shockingly lifeless 
to anyone who had ever seen the 
ruby-lighted, flame-shot wells of vi- 
brant force that normal Fenachrone 
eyes were — and said lifelessly, 
“There is a point, the certainty of 
death, at which struggle becomes 
negative instead of positive. It mere- 
ly prolongs the agony. Having pass- 
ed that point, I die.” 

“There is no such point, idiot, 
while life lasts! Do I look like 
Klazmon of Llurdiax?” 

“No, but death is no less certain 
at your hands than at his.” 

“Why should it be, stupid?” and 
DuQuesne’s sneer was extra-high-vol- 
tage stuff, even for Doctor Marc 
C. DuQuesne. 

Now was the crucial moment. IF 
he could .take all those Fenachrone 
over, and IF he could control them 
after they got back to normal, what 
a crew they would make! He stared 
contemptuously at the ex-admiral 
and went on: 



“Whether or not you and your 
four thousand die in the near future 
is up to you. While I do not have 
to have a crew, I can use one effic- 
iently for a few weeks. If you choose 
to work with me I will, at the end 
of that time, give you a duplicate of 
your original spaceship and will see 
to it that you are allowed to resume 
your journey wherever you wish.” 

“Sir, the Fenachrone do not . 
the doctor began stiffly. 

“Shut up, you poor, dumb 
clown!” DuQuesne snapped. 
“Haven’t you learned anything? That 
instead of being the strongest race 
in space you are one of the weakest? 
You have one choice merely — co- 
operate or die. And that is not 
yours, but Sleemet’s. Sleemet?” 

“But how do I know that if . .” 

“If you have any part of a brain, 
fool, use it! What matters it to me 
whether Fenachrone live or die? 
I’m not asking you anything; I’m 
telling you under what conditions 
I will save your lives. If you want 
to argue the matter I’ll put you three 
— and the bed — back where you 
were and be on my way. Which do 
you prefer?” 

Sleemet had learned something. 
He had been beaten down flat 
enough so that he could learn some- 
thing — and he realized that he had 
much to learn from any race who 
could do what his rescuer had just 
done. 

“We will work with you,” Sleemet 
said. “You will, I trust, instruct us 
concerning how you liberated us 
three and propose to liberate the 
others?” 

“I can’t. It was fourth-dimension- 



154 



IF 




al translation.” DuQuesne lied 
blandly. “Did you ever try to ex- 
plain the color ‘blue* to a man born 
blind? No scientist of your race will 
be able to understand either the 
theory or the mechanics of fourth 
dimensional translation for some- 
thing like eleven hundred thousand 
of your years.”

DuQuesne and Sleemet 

E n route to the galaxy in which 
DuQuesne’s aliens supposedly 
lived, Dorothy said, “Say Dick. I 
forgot to ask you something. What 
did you ever find out about that 
thought business of Kay-Lee’s?” 
“Huh?” Seaton was surprised. 
“What was there to find out? How 
are you going to explain the mech- 
anism of thought — by unscrewing 
the inscrutable? She said, and I 
quote, ‘We didn’t feel that we were 
quite reaching you,’ unquote. So it 
was she and Ree-Toe Prenk. Ob- 
viously. Holding hands or something 
— across a Ouija board or some 
other focusing device, probably. 
Staring into each other’s eyes to 
link minds and direct the thought.” 
“But they did hit you with some- 
thing,” she insisted, “and it bothers 
me. They can do it and we can’t.” 
“No sweat, pet. That isn’t a cir- 
cumstance to what you do every 
time you think at a controller to 
order up a meal or whatever. How 
do you do that? Different people, 
different abilities, is all. Anyway, 
Earth mediums have done that kind 
of thing for ages. If you’re really 



interested, you can take some time 
off and learn it, next time we’re 
on Ray-See-Nee. But for right now, 
my red-headed beauty, we’ve got 
something besides that kind of mon- 
key-business to worry about.” 

“That’s right, we have,” and Dor- 
othy forgot the minor matter in 
thinking of the major. “Those aliens. 
Have you and Martin figured out a 
modus operandi?” 

“More or less. Go in openly, like 
tourists, but with everything we’ve 
got not only on the trips but hyped 
up to as nearly absolutely instantan- 
eous reactivity as the Brain can pos- 
sibly get it.” 

B oth DuQuesne’s DQ and Seaton’s 
Skylark of Valeron were within 
range of Llurdiax. DuQuesne, how- 
ever. as has been said, was covering 
up as tightly as he could. Every- 
thing that could be muzzled or muf- 
fled was muzzled or muffled, and 
he was traveling comparatively slow- 
ly, so as to put out the minimum of 
detectable high-order emanation. Fur- 
thermore, his screens were shoved 
out to such a tremendous distance, 
and were being varied so rapidly 
and so radically in shape, that no real 
pattern existed to be read. The DQ 
was not indetectable, of course, but 
it would have taken a great deal of 
highly specialized observation and 
analysis to find her. 

The Skylark of Valeron, on the 
other hand, was coming in wide 
open: “Like a tourist”, as Seaton 
had told Dorothy the plan was to 
do. 

In the llanzlanate on Llurdiax, 
therefore, an observer alerted Klaz- 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



155 




mon, who flew immediately to his 
master-control panel. He checked 
the figures the observer had given 
him, and was as nearly appalled as 
a Llurd could become. An artificial 
structure of that size and mass — it 
was certainly not a natural plane- 
toid — had never even been thought 
of by any builder of record. He 
measured its acceleration — the Val - 
eron was still braking down at max 
— and his eyes bulged. That thing, 
tremendous as it was, had the power- 
to-mass ratio of a speedster! In spite 
of its immense size it was actually 
an inter-galactic flyer! 

He launched a probe, as he had 
done so many times before — but 
with entirely unexpected results. 

The stranger’s guardian screens 
were a hundred times as reactive as 
any known to Llurdan science. He 
was not allowed time for even the 
briefest of mental contacts or for 
any real observation at all. So in- 
finitesimal had been the instant us- 
able time that only one fact was 
clear. The entities in that mobile 
monstrosity were — positively — Jel- 
moids. 

Not true Jelmi, certainly. He knew 
all about the Jelmi. Those tapes 
bore unmistakable internal evidence 
of being true and complete records 
and there was no hint anywhere in 
them of anything like this. If not 
the Jelmi, who? Ah, yes, the Fena- 
chrone, whose fleet ... no, Sleemet 
knew nothing of such a construction 
. and he was not exactly of the 
same race ... ah, yes, that one 
much larger ship that had escaped. 
The probability was high that its 
one occupant belonged to precisely 



the same Jelmoid race as did the 
personnel of this planetoid. The es- 
caped one had reported Klazmon’s 
cursory investigation as an attack. 
It was a virtual certainty, therefore, 
that this was a battleship of that 
race, heading for LIurdiax to ... to 
what? To investigate merely? No. 

Nor merely to parley. They had 
made no attempt whatever to com- 
municate. (It did not occur to Klaz- 
mon, then or ever, that his own 
fiercely driven probe could not pos- 
sibly have been taken for an attempt 
at communication. He had fully in- 
tended to communicate, as soon as 
he had seized the mind of whoever 
was in command of the strange 
spacecraft.) And now, with the stran- 
ger’s incredible full-coverage screen 
in operation, communication was 
and would remain impossible. 

But he had data sufficient for 
action. These Jelmoids, like all oth- 
ers he knew, were rabidly anti-social, 
illogical, unreasoning, unsane and 
insane. They were — definitely — 
surplus population. 

So thinking, Llanzlan Klazmon 
launched his attack. 

A s the Skylark entered that enig- 
matic galaxy, Seaton was not in 
his home, with only a remote-control 
helmet with which to work. He was 
in the control room itself, at the 
base of the Brain, with the tre- 
mendously complex-master-control 
itself surrounding his head. Thus he 
was attuned to and in instantaneous 
contact with every activated cell of 
that gigantic Brain. It was ready to 
receive and to act upon with the 
transfinite speed of thought any or- 



156 



IF 




der that Seaton would think. Nor 
would any such action interfere in 
any way with the automatics that 
Seaton had already set up. 

“I’m going to stay here all day,” 
Seaton said, “and all night tonight, 
too, if necessary.” 

But he did not have to stay there 
even all day. In less than four hours 
the llanzlan drove his probe and 
Seaton probed practically instantan- 
eously back. And since Seaton’s 
hyped-up screens were .a hundred 
times faster than the Llurd’s, Seaton 
“saw” a hundred times as much as 
Klazmon did. He saw the city Llur- 
dias in all its seat-of-empire pride 
and glory. He perceived its miles- 
wide girdle of fortresses. He per- 
ceived the llanzlanate; understood 
its functions and purposes. He enter- 
ed the Hall of Computation and ex- 
amined minutely the beings and the 
machines at work there. 

How could all this be? Because the 
speed of thought, if not absolutely 
infinite, is at least transfinite; im- 
measurable to man. And the Valer- 
on’s inorganic brain and Seaton’s 
organic one were, absolutely and 
super-intimately, the two component 
parts of one incredibly able, effi- 
cient and proficient whole. 

Thus, when the alien’s attack was 
launched in all its fury and almost 
all of the Valeroris mighty defensive 
engines went simultaneously into 
automatic action, the coded chirp- 
ings that the Brain employed to 
summon human help did not sound: 
that Brain’s builder, fellow, boss, 
and perfect complement was already 
on the job. 

And thus, since no warning had 



been given, the other Skylarkers 
were surprised when Seaton called 
them all down into the control room. 

They were even more surprised 
when they saw how white and strain- 
ed his face was. 

“This may become weree unfun- 
ny,” he said. “’Tsa good thing I 
muscled her up or we’d be losing 
some skin and some of our defense. 
As it is, we’re holding ’em and we’ve 
got a few megas in reserve. Not 
enough to be really happy about, 
but some. And we’re building more, 
of course. However , that ape down 
there has undoubtedly got a lot of 
stuff otherwheres on the planet that 
he can hook in pretty fast, so what- 
ever we’re going to do we’d better 
do right now.” 

“They didn’t try to communicate 
at all?” Crane asked. “Strange for 
a race of such obviously high at- 
tainments.” 

“Not a lick,” Seaton said, flatly. 
“Just a probe; the hardest and 
sharpest probe I ever saw. When I 
blocked it — Whammo !” 

“You probed, too, of course,” 
Dorothy said. “What did you find 
out? Are they really monstrous, as 
DuQuesne said, out purely to kill?” 

“Just that. He wasn’t lying a nick- 
el’s worth on that. His Nibs down 
there had already decided that we 
were surplus population and should 
be eliminated, and he set right out 
to do it. So, unless some of you 
have some mighty valid reasons not 
to, I’m going to try my damndest 
to eliminate him, right now.” 

“We could run, I suppose,” Mar- 
garet suggested — but not at all 
enthusiastically. 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



157 




“I doubt it. Not without letting 
him burn us down to basketball 
size, like the Chlorans did. He un- 
doubtedly let us get this close on 
purpose so we couldn’t.” 

S ince no one else said anything, 
Seaton energized everything of 
offense he had. He tuned it as pre- 
cisely as he possibly could. He as : 
sembled it into the tightest, solidest, 
hardest beam he could possibly 
build. Then, involuntarily tensing his 
muscles and hunching his back, he 
drove the whole gigantic thing 
squarely at where he knew the llanz- 
lante was. 

The Llurd’s outer screen scarcely 
flickered as it went black in nothing 
flat of time. The intermediate screen 
held for eighty-three hundredths of 
a second. Then the practically irre- 
sistible force of that beam met the 
practically immovable object that 
was Klazmon’s last line of defense. 
And as it clawed and bit and tore 
and smashed in ultra-pyrotechnic 
ferocity, solar-like flares of raw 
energy erupted from the area of con- 
tact and the very ether writhed and 
seethed and warped under the in- 
tolerable stresses of the utterly in- 
comprehensible forces there at grips. 

This went on . and on . and 
on. 

Even to Seaton, who knew only 
that he was up against an enemy 
nearly as potent as the Chlorans, the 



full import of the enormous struggle 
of energies then being waged was 
far from clear. We can wonder now, 
and ask ourselves what the fate of 
the universe might have been if the 
Skylark’s Norlaminian designers had 
skimped on a course of screens, or 
overlooked a detail of defense. Sure- 
ly its consequences would have been 
cataclysmic! Not only to Seaton and 
his Skylarker, watching grim-faced 
as their gauges revealed the enor- 
mous flow of destructive forces bat- 
tling each other to annihilation for 
countless parsecs in every direction. 
Not only to the Jelmi, or the Ray- 
See-Neese, or the Norlaminians, or 
Earth itself . but to countless 
generations yet unborn, on planets 
not yet discovered . 

But they held. 

And after ten endless minutes of 
such terrible gouts and blasts of 
destruction as no planet could en- 
dure for a moment, Seaton heard a 
voice speak to him. 

He had never heard it before, but 
it said in good American English: 
“Good morning, my friends. Or per- 
haps, by your clocks, it is good after- 
noon? I am the Llanzlan Mergon of 
Jelm, and I perceive that you are 
under attack by our old acquaint- 
ances, the Llurdi. You, I am sure, 
are the Seatons and the Cranes, 
about whom we heard so much on 
Earth, but whom we were not able 
to find.”

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet . 



Dear Editor: 

I expect you’ll get a fairly large 
amount of correspondence about Mr. 
R. Milton's letter concerning Esper- 
anto; the issue seems to be one in 
which a large number of people are 
interested (as both John Campbell 
and Willy Ley have found out in the 
past). 

I agree with Mr. Milton whole- 
heartedly. One of the problems to 
which he refers, that of the ordinary 
non-English-speaker who has stud- 
ied English being too timid or em- 
barrassed to use it in front of a 
native English-speaker, is well 
known to me from personal experi- 
ence. My wife, who comes from 
Mexico City, had a year of English 
in high school and in addition has 
lived in the U.S.A. for two years. 
One would think that after that 
much time she would be fairly con- 
fident, but actually she has that 
same problem attributed by Mr. Mil- 
ton to so many other people. If this 
is the case with someone who has 
used only English for the last two 
years (and who in addition is a 
bright girl with something of a head 
for languages), consider the poor 



European student who has studied 
English for four or five years, five 
to ten hours a week, and can now 
read a technical paper in the langu- 
age — but has never really had oc- 
casion to speak it. 

I also agree with Mr. Milton'* 
proposed solution to the problem. 
Esperanto was constructed with two 
basic ideas in mind: facility and 
beauty. Those who have studied it* 
history will tell you that it is a 
work more of art than of science — 
although what is art but a science 
of esthetics? 

It might take two or three min- 
utes to learn the full conjugation yt 
an Esperanto verb. What other lan- 
guage can even come close to that? 
As to the nouns and adjectives — 
put together, they might ake thirty 
seconds; try learning how to decline 
all English nouns, singular or plur- 
al, nominative and genitive, in thirty 
seconds. Or thirty hours. 

Esperanto has its own literature, 
original as well as translated; and 
its own speaking population; and 
the governments of several countries 
consider it worthy of government- 
subsidized magazines. It seems to 



159 




be catching on all over the world 
now. Even in the United States 
there is at least one school system 
in which it is taught in all (24).

Dear Editor: 

There are many things that can 
be said about If that would be ap- 
proving, but I will limit most of this 
letter to some complaints that I have 
been saving up for some time now. 

The first one concerns the print- 
ing of your magazine (here I must 
also include Galaxy and Worlds of 
Tomorrow ) . Many of the pages have 
been over-inked so that they are 
difficult to read. 

Number two: the paper you have 
been using is very poor. Some of the 
issues I have from early in the fif- 
ties are in better shape than those 
of only three or four years of age. 

Finally: although readers are con- 
tinually writing in and gushing 
about the quality of the artwork of 
your covers, I have to disagree. 
Looking through all the back issues 
of your magazines, I found only one 
that is really good and that posses- 
ses a feeling outside of the text it 
illustrates. I'm speaking of the cover 
by McKenna on the June, 1963, issue 
Of Galaxy, depicting a ruined space- 
ship against the background of a 
spiral galaxy. 

I will cease my disapprobations 
here and try to put down some of 
the conflagration I have started by 
saying that I buy and read all three 
of your publications, and especially 
enjoy If . for the quality of the 
paper stories are printed on has 
little to do with their merit. But 
when the stories are so good, it is 
all the more important that one oe

• We like a letter like this; it gives 
us something to sink our teeth into. 
First about the printing and pro- 
duction: we've had some difficulties 
along that line, but we hope to im- 
prove things shortly. About the cov- 
ers: There's an interesting thing 

about that cover you mention. We 
thought it was great too. Everybody 
in the office who saw it agreed it 
was a fine job — which seldom hap- 
pens. Nearly every reader who has 
commented on covers in the past 
year or two has mentioned it as one 
they liked. There is no doubt that 
in terms of expressed opinion it was 
one of the most popular covers we've 
ever run . and yet (we'll let you 
in on a trade secret) it had the 
worst sale of any issue over a three- 
year period. If you know why, please 
tell us — we don't. But one thing we 
do know, and that is that the cov- 
ers that people like are not neces- 
sarily the covers that make them 
buy. And of course if we have to 
choose between one or the other — 
there's no choice! 

Yes, we'd like to see us have Rob- 
ert Heinlein's new book for you 
too. There is one, as you deduce, and 
we hope to have it; but there are a 
few problems. One is that at present 
the manuscript runs about as long 
as three ordinary science-fiction 
novels ! — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

Since I now count 18 rejection 



IF 




slips from //, I figure an easy way 
to get published is to write a letter 
to Hue & Cry. There are two things 
I want to say to reader David Lyon. 
As a high-school student, 1 resent 
being compared with “beer slops”. 
Among high-school students science 
fiction — not monster stories! — is 
greatly loved. After all, what other 
genre has produced anything to 
compare with Canticle for Leibo - 
witz? Secondly, the story Mr. Lyon 
was looking for is The Silk and the 
Song . 

Congrats on the long-awaited Sky- 
lark DuQuesne! It’s as good as the 
three previous Skylarks; maybe bet- 
ter. Looking forward to the next two 
installments. — S. Alan Simon, 27 
Garland Drive, Eggertsville, New 
York 14226.

Dear Editor: 

I’ve a few money-making sugges- 
tions for you. 

Firstly, why not sell enlarged — 
say, 8 x 12 — color reproductions of 
your covers, suitable for framing, 
minus the print, of course. 

Secondly, so far as I know, no 
one has ever printed a science- 
fiction fan’s calendar. It should be 
an easy enough matter to print one 
with a cover or interior illustration 
for each month. Possibly an alma- 
nac calendar showing the birthdays 
of top-notch Science-fiction writers. 

Thirdly, you could sell binders for 
storing back issues of //, Galaxy 
and World# of Tomorrow . H. L. Gold 
used to do that when he was editor, 
didn’t he? Maybe these ideas don’t 
hold water, but if they do you’re 
welcome to them. — Brian Baldwin, 
212 Harding Road, Chattanooga 15, 
Texas. 

• Matter of fact, we have thought 
about a calendar from time to time. 



Wonder how many would be inter- 
ested. — Editor .

Dear Editor: 

You were right: The Killing Ma- 
chine was a good story, may e 
somewhat better than Starchild. 

I’m not sure, but I think youVe 
set a record of some kind with five 
excellent issues in a row, from cover 
to editorial — including the stories. 
Keep it up! 

Why not try to squeeze a story 
out of Harlan Ellison? His type of 
writing fits your magazine to a T, 
and you’ll have some one to compete 
with Keith Laumer to see who can 
kill the most people in one story. — 
A. J. Spegel, 221 Anderson Road, 

Linwood, Michigan.

Dear Editor: 

I am not a habitual writer of let- 
ters to sf magazines even though 
I am a habitual reader . but the 
moon is full . 

I personally am unconcerned 
about the demise of Outer Limits 
and its ilk on television. Television 
is a medium particularly unsuited 
to the freedom that science fiction 
demands and would not know what 
to do with that freedom even if it 
had it. I understand, though, that 
an sf show called Lost in Space will 
be on one of the networks next sea- 
son, so video sf is not dead. 

I was skeptical about the new 
Skylark story; I don’t like to ad- 
mit it, but I could never get too 
excited over either the Lensman or 
Skylark stories. Nevertheless, Part 
I of Skylark DuQuesne does have a 
certain something ... It also has 
Doc Smith’s ridiculous conversation. 
Every time Dick Seaton opens his 
mouth I wince. 

Concerning book reviews : I be-

long to that breed of neurotics that 
enjoys reading book reviews. Algis 
Budrys in Galaxy is good but not 
long enough for my taste. There 
must be somebody you could get for 
//. 

James H. Schmitz is becoming one 
of the most ubiquitous names in 
magazine science fiction. His stories 
keep you reading, but after you've 
finished you wish you hadn't wasted 
the time. Maybe he should go into 
television. — Ed Brenner, 30 Rich- 
mond Street, Brooklyn, New York

Dear Editor: 

1 just finished reading Robert F. 
Young's When Time Was Young in 
the December issue of your maga- 
zine. For the most part the sf stories 
1 have read involving paleontology 
have testified to a certain amount 
of research on the part of the au- 
thor. Mr. Young’s story (possibly 
though up while escorting two small 
children through a natural history 
museum) bespeaks no such effort 
May I suggest some study of the 
temporal and geographic ranges of 
the genre whose names he throws 
about w*th such authority 

One thing to be said in Mr. 
Young’s favor. At least he didn’t 
clutter the Upper Cretaceous land- 
scape with Lepidodenarons , seed 
ferns and Calamites. This is not 
the case with your cover artist, who 
has some pretty un -Cretaceous 
plants in the background and has 
put three toes on the Tyrannosaur- 
us’ two large front feet. — Bonnie 
Dalzell, Student Paleontologist, Uni- 
versity of California at Berkeley, 
2C01 Berkeley Way, Berkeley, Cali- 
fornia.

Dear Editor: 

With all this fuss about sf on 



TV, I don’t think anybody’s been 
considering the reporting of space 
flights. I urge all fans to write to 
the network news sections calling 
for a science-fiction writer to be 
present at coverage of future 
launches. It would, I think, make the 
commentary much more interesting 
. and might bring a few mo r e 
converts around to sf. 

Anybody interested in forming a 
club of young science-fiction fans 
is urged to write either to me or 
Sheridan Simon, 27 Garland Drive, 
Eggertsville, New York 14226. 

Finally, when is C. C. MacApp 
going to write a sequel to Under the 
Gaddyl t in the April, 1964, issue of 
Worlds of Tomorrow ? — James Ed- 
ward Turner, P. 0. Box 161, Pilot 
Knob, Missouri, 63663. 

• Matter of fact, we requested per- 
mission once to view a manned 
launching and were turned down 
flat. The National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration appears to 
feel that the less truck they have 
with science fiction, the more easily 
they'll be able to get crazy approp- 
riations from congressmen who may 
be a little suspicious of all this crazy 
space business in the first place. 
We have an idea that the TV net- 
works would have the same re- 
action . but it’s a good idea 
anyway ! 

That winds us up for another 
month. All you fellows who have 
been writing in demanding a Retief 
novel — don’t forget we’ve got one 
starting next month! 

This month’s “First” — i. e., first 
story publication for another new 
science-fiction writer — is Dannie 
Plachta’s Alien Artifact . We have 
one of these every issue, you know. 
Maybe one of these days it’ll be 
yours • • • The Editor
