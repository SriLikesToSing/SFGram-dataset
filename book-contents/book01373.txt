THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT 
SAVES THE WORLD 

Harry Harrison 



ABYSS OF 
TARTARUS 

Robert F. Young 







Can Freddie Fong Fine save the world? 

If so, should he? 

If you have never asked yourself 
either of these questions, it is time 
you read SACRED LOCOMO- 
TIVE FLIES, in which Dick 
Lupoff does ask them. Whether 
he answers them is another mat- 
ter. Along the way, we encounter 
the Sacred Locomotive, the Israeli 
hyponuclear submarine Traif, the 
Phantom Tanager (and/or Cocka- 
too, etc.). Mavis Montreal the 
groupie, the enormous cavern be- 
neath the earth, Ali the lady Mars 
pilot, and other denizens and fea- 
tures of the world of 1985. And each thinking reader will ask himself 
more than once: “It could get this bad in only fourteen years? Or is it 
this bad now?” — 

SACRED LOCOMOTIVE FLIES is a September Beagle book— and so 
are THE SECOND FONTANA BOOK OF GREAT GHOST STORIES 
and THE FONTANA BOOK OF GREAT HORROR STORIES-fan- 
tastic chillers by the top writers of this century. In October we have our 
Hallowe’en Horror Bash, with THE HORROR IN THE MUSEUM, a 
collection of H. P. Lovecraft’s collaborations with other writers; Lady 
Cynthia Asquith’s GHOST BOOK, the classic collection of ghost stories; 
John Brunner’s horror/sf/thriller THE GAUDY SHADOWS, and choice 
goodies from our Lovecraft, SF ghost and horror backlists. 

To come: THE TRIPS OF TOCK VON and further novels from Leo P. 
Kelley; more adventures of Summer of Muckrake by Ron Goulart; more 
ghost and horror-story collections. Also P. G. Wodehouse— could there 
be a new Fandom here?

CRY

Sir: 

J. W. Zabei has in the Mar j Apr 
Hue and Cry made an honest ef- 
fort to codify via eight descrip- 
tive points the function of science 
fiction. His efforts don’t appear 
to me to be completely rational, 
though. For each acceptable de- 
scription, hi has produced twice 
as many ambiguous and incor- 
rect descriptions of xhpjtote of 
the art. ~ 

Science fiction exercises the. 
imagination, deliberately, a fac- 
et setting it aside from other 
genre. Score one Zabei. But in 
other penetrations into the read- 
ers’ minds SF does nothing that is 
unique-T-nor different. 

Reading anything will develop 
perspective — whether that per- 
spective devolves onto one’s self or 
on the world, whether one enjoys 
it or not, even if one fads com- 
pletely to understand what he is 
reading. (Failure at least shows 
the limits of the redder, a new 
signpost' for self-development.) 
Science fiction doesn’t do those 
things exclusively, or even on pur- 
pose. As for expanding readers’ 
interests into the arts, science 
fiction is a veritable gold mine of 
s,cientific news and predictions 
in fictional, form. But art? The 
arts developed in sf are imma- 



ture in axtiparison to other nar- 
rative^ writing. Many stories pub- 
lished as sf. though very enter- 
taining. exist only for the gim- 
mick involved— or to communi- 
cate a scientific idea — and can’t 
stand up to the question: "Is it 
art?". Even the New Wave^ en- 
deavors only repeat techniques 
abandoned forty years ago, while 
Brunner’s magnificent Stand Oii 
Zanzibar owes a lot to John Dos 
Passos. And politics? Politics are a 
part of everyday life, whether civic 
or social, and science fiction has 
yet to do anything but ad<q>t this 
human preoccupation. 

Science fiction examines ideas 
pragmatically. What else can a 
genre based on ideas do: each new 
thought has to be milked com- 
pletdy. What other type of liter- 
ature is still reworking story ideas 
first published ninety years ago, as 
we do with Wells, Verne, etc? 

Sf examines the consequences of 
change? Zabel’s statement here is 
too ambiguous to answer. Every 
story told by man (myth, news 
story, mystery, sf, mainstream) is 
built on change for nobody is in- 
terested in non-change. Who’d 
write arty thing based on: "The 
rock sat?** If the rock were dif- 
ferent or changed the environment 
somehow — yes. But only conflict 
— change — makes stories. 

Scientifiction has always wedded 
art to science. Yet sf no longer 
rrterely weds art to science and this 
is Just a fragment of the defini- 
tion. Zabel’s point, “The illustra- 
tion of principles,’’ is Just a quali- 
fier for the scientifiction defini-

THERE are some things that cannot

know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature's laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid^ 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of lifers problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes toaay.

WORLD 



The Rat had to return 
to Planet Dirt — if only 
he could find it in Time! 



HARRY HARRISON 



46^/^ ^ crook, James 

^ Bolivar diGriz,” Inskipp 
said, making animal noises deep in 
his throat while shaking the sheaf 
of papers viciously in my direc- 
tion. I leaned back against the 



sideboard in his ofHce, a picture 
of shocked sincerity. 

“I am innocent,” I sobbed: ‘‘A 
victim of a campaign of cold 
calculating lies.” I had his 
humidor behind my back and by 
touch alone — 1 really ant good at 
this sort of thing — I felt for the 
lock. 

^‘Embezzlement, swindling and 
worse— the reports are still com- 
ing in. You have been cheating 
your own organization, our Spe- 
cial Corps, your own buddies — ” 

“Never!” I cried, lockpick busy 
in my fingers. 

“They don’t call you Slippery 
Jim for nothing — ” 

“A mistake, a childish nick- 
name. My mother found nie a 
slippery baby when soaping me 
in the bath.” The humidor sprang 
open and my nose twitched at the 
aroma of fragrant leaf. 

“Do you know how much you 
have stolen?” His face was bright 
red now and his eyes were begin- 
ning to bulge in a highly unat- 
tractive manner. 

“Me? Steal? 1 would rather 
die first!” I declaimed movingly 
as I slipped out handful of the in- 
credibly expensive cigars des- 
tined for visiting VIP’s. I could 
put them to a far more important 
use by smoking them myself. I 
am forced to admit that my atten- 
tion was more On the purloined to- 
bacco than on Inskipp’s tedious 
complaints and I did not at first 
notice the change in his voice. 



But suddenly I realized that I 
could barely hear his words — hot 
that he was whispering. It was 
more as though there were a vol- 
ume control in his throat that had 
suddenly been turned down. 

“Speak up, Inskipp,” I told him 
firmly. “Or are you suddenly beset 
with guilt over these false accusa- 
tions?” 

I stepped away from the side- 
board, half turning as I moved in 
order to mask the fact that I was 
slipping about a hundred credits’ 
worth of exotic tobacco into my 
pocket. He prattled on weakly, ig- 
noring me, shaking the papers 
soundlessly now. 

“Aren’t you feeling well?” 

I asked this with a certain 
amount of real concern, because 
he was beginning to sound quite 
distant. He did not turn his head 
to look at me when I moved but in- 
stead kept staring at the place 
where I had been, nattering away 
in an inaudible voice. And he was 
looking pale. I blinked and looked 
again. 

Not pale, transparent. 

The back of his chair was very 
definitely becoming visible through 
his head. 

“Stop it!” 1 shouted, but he did 
not appear to hear. “What games 
are you playing? Is this some soil 
of 3D projection to fool me? Why 
bother? Slippery Jim’s not the 
kind who can be fooled, ha-ha!” 

Walking quickly across the 
room I put out my hand and poked 



6 



IF 




my index Anger into his forehead. 
It went in — there was slight resis- 
tance — and he did not seem to 
mind in the least. But when I with- 
drew it there was a slight popping 
sound and he vanished com- 
pletely while the sheaf of papers, 
now unsupported, fell to the desk- 
top. 

“Whargh!” I grunted, or some- 
thing equally incomprehensible. I 
bent to look for hidden devices 
under the chair when, with a nasty 
crunching sound, the offlce door 
was broken down. 

N OW this was something I 
could understand. I whirled 
about, still in the crouch, and was 
ready for the Arst man when he 
came through. The hard edge of 
my hand got him in the throat, 
right under the gas mask, and he 
gurgled and dropped. But there 
were plenty more behind him, all 
with masks and white coats, wear- 
ing little black packs on their 
backs, either bareAsted or carry- 
ing improvised clubs. It was all 
very unusual. Weight of numbers 
forced me back but 1 caught one of 
them under the chin with my toe 
while a hard jab to the solar plexus 
polished off another. Then 1 had 
my shoulders to the wall and they 
began to swarm over me. 1 
smashed one of them across the 
back of the neck and he fell. And 
vanished halfway to the Aoor. 

This was very interesting. The 
number of people in the room be- 



gan to change rapidfy now as some 
of the men I hit snuffed out of 
sight. A good thing that helped 
even the ^ds, except for the fact 
that others kept appearing out of 
thin air at about the same rate. I 
struggled to get to the door; could 
not make it. Then the club got me 
in the side of the head and 
scrambled my brains nicely. 

After that it was like trying to 
Aght slow-motion under water. I 
hit a few more of them but my 
heart wasn’t really in it. They had 
my arms and legs and began to 
drag me from the room. I writhed 
about a certain amount and cursed 
them fluently in a half dozen 
languages but all of this had just 
about the results you would ex- 
pect. They rushed me from the 
room and down the corridor and 
into the waiting- elevator. One of 
them held up a canister and 1 tried 
to turn my head aiyay, but the blast 
of gas caught me full in the face. 

It did nothing for me that 1 could 
feel, though ! did get angrier. Kick- 
ing and snapping my teeth and 
shouting insults. The masked 
men mumbled back in what might 
have been irritated mutterings, 
which only goaded me to greater 
fury. By the time we reached our 
destination I was ready to kill — 
which 1 normally do not And easy 
to do — and certainly , would have 
if 1 hadn’t been strapped into a 
gadgety electric chair and had 
electrodes fastened to my wrists 
and ankles.

**Tell them that Jim diGriz died 
like a man, you dogs!’’ I shouted, 
not without a certain amount of 
slavering and foaming. A metal 
helmet was lowered over my head 
and just before it covered my face 
I managed to call out, ”Up the 
Special Corps! And up your — ” 
Darkness descend^ and I was 
aware that death or electrocution 
or brain destruction or worse was 
imminent. 

N othing happened and the 
helmet was raised again and 
one of the attackers gave me an- 
other shot in the face from a canis- 
ter and I felt the overwhelming 
anger draining away as fast as it 
had arrived. 1 blinked a bit'at this 
and saw that they were freeing my 
arms and legs. I aJso saw that most 
of them had their masks off now 
and were recognizable as the 
Corps technicians and scientists 
who usually puttered about this 
lab. 

“Someone wouldn’t like to tell 
me just what the hell is going on, 
would they?’’ 

“Let me fix this first,’’ one of 
them said, a gray-haired man with 
.buckteeth like old yellowed 
gravestones caught between his 
lips. He hung one of the black 
packs from my shoulder and 
pulled a length of wire from it that 
had a metal button on the end. He 
te^uched the button to the back of 
my neck, where it stuck. 



“You?re Professor Coypu,aren’t 
you?’’ 

“I am.’’ The teeth moved up and 
down like piano keys. 

“Would you think me rude if I 
asked for an explanation?’’ 

“Not at all. Only natural under 
the circumstances. Terribly 
sorry we had to rough you up. Only 
way. Get you off balance, keep 
you angry. The angry, mind exists 
only for itself and can survive by 
Itself. If we had tried to reason, to 
tell you the problem, we would 
have defeated our own purpose. 
So we attacked. Gave you the 
anger gas as well as breathing it 
oursdves. Only thing to do. Oh, 
blast, there goes Magistero. It’s 
getting stronger even in here.’’ 

One of the white-coated men 
shimmered and grew transparent, 
then vanished. 

“Inskipp went that way,” I said. 

“He would. First to go you 
know.” 

“Why?” I asked, smiling warm- 
ly, thinking that this was the most 
idiotic conversation I had ever 
had. 

“They are after the Corps. Pick 
off the top people first.” 

“Who?” 

“Don’t know.” 

I heard my teeth grating to- 
gether but managed to keep my 
temper. “Would you kindly ex- 
plain in greater detail or find 
someone who can make more 
sense of this affair than you have 
been doing.” 




“Sorry. My fault entirely.” He 
dabbed at a beading of sweat on 
his forehead and a whisk of red 
tongue dampened the dry en<ls of 
his teeth. “It all came about so 
fast, you know. Emergency mea- 
sures, everything. Time war I 
imagine one might call it. Some- 
one, somewhere, somewhen, is 
tampering with time. Naturally 
they had to pick the Special Corps 
as their first target, no matter 
what other ambitions they might 
have. Since the Corps is the most 
effective, most widespread supra- 
national and supra-planetal law- 
enforcement organization in the 
history of the galaxy we automat- 
ically become the main obstacle in 
their path. Sooner or later in any 
ambitious time-changing plan they 
run up against the Corps. They 
have therefore elected to do it 
sooner. If they can eliminate In- 
skipp and the other top people the 
probability of the Corps’ existence 
will be lowered and we’ll all snuff 
out like poor Magistero did just 
then.” 

I blinked rapidly. “Do you think 
we could have a drink that might 
act as a bit of lubricant to my 
thoughts?” 

“Splendid idea, join you my- 
self.” 

The dispenser produced a sickly 
sort of green liquid th^t he favored 
but I dialed for a large Syrian 
Panther Sweat, most of which I 
drained with the first swallow. This 
frightening beverage — who^ hid- 



eous aftereffects forbade its sale 
oh most civilized worlds— did me 
nothing but good at that moment. 
I finished the glass and a sudden 
memory popped up out of the 
tangled jumble of my subcon- 
scious. 

“Stop me if I’m wrong, but 
didn’t I hear you lecture once 
about the impossibility of time 
travel?” 

“Of course. My specialty. 
Smoke screen, that talk. We’ve had 
time travel for years here. Afraid 
to use it, though. Alter time tracks 
and all that sort of trouble. Just the 
kind of thing that is happening 
now. But we have had a continu- 
ing project of resear<^ and time 
investigation. Which is why we 
knew what was happening when it 
began to happen. The alarms 
were going off and we had no time 
to warn anyone — not that warn- 
ings would do any good. We were 
aware of our duty. Plus the fact 
that we were the only ones who 
could do anything at all. We jury 
rigged a time-fixator around this 
laboratory, then made the smaller 
pprtable models, such as the one 
you are wearipg now.” 

“What does it do?” I asked, 
touching with great respect the 
metal disk on the nape of my neck. 

“Has a recording of your 
memory that it keeps feeding back 
to your brain every three millisec- 
onds. Telling you that you are, 
that you see, and rebuilding any 
personality changes that time-line

alterations in the past may have 
shifted. "Purely a defensiye 
mechanism, but it is all we have.” 
Out of the corner of my eye I saw 
another man wink out of sight and 
the professor’s voice grew grim. 
‘‘We must attack if we are to save 
the Corps.” 

“Attack? How?” 

"‘‘Send someone back in time to 
uncover the forces waging this 
time war. and destroy them before 
they destroy us. We have a ma- 
chine.” 

‘‘1 volunteer. Sounds like my 
kind of job.” 

‘‘There is no way to return. It is 
a one-way mission.” 

“I withdraw the last statement. 1 
like it here.” Sudden memory — 
restored no doubt threq millisec- 
onds earlier — grabbed me and a 
prod of fear pumped a number of 
interesting chemical substances in- 
to my blood. 

‘‘Angelina, my Angelina. I must 
speak to her — ” 

‘‘She is not the only one.” 

‘‘The only one for me. Professor. 
Now stand aside or I’ll go through 
you.” 

H e stepped back, frowning 
and mumbling and tapping his 
teeth with his fingernails, and I 
jabbed the code into the phone. The 
screen beeped twice and the few 
seconds crawled by like lead snails 
before she answered the call. 
‘‘You’re there?” I gasped.' 
‘‘Where did you expect me to 



be?” A frown cr<x$sed her perfect 
features and she sniffed as though 
to get the aroma of booze from the 
screen. ‘‘You’ve been drink- 
ing — and so early too.” 

‘‘Just a drop, but that’s not why 
I called. How are you? You look 
great, not transparent at all.” 

‘‘A drop? Sounds more like a 
whole bottle.” Her voice chilled 
and there was more than a trace 
left of the old, unreformed 
Angelina, the most ruthless and 
deadly crook in the galaxy before 
the Corps medics straightened out 
the knots in her brain. ‘‘I suggest 
you hang up. Get a drive-right pill, 
then call me back as soon as you 
are sober.” She reached out for the 
disconnect button. 

"Dont\ I am cold sober and 
wish I weren’t. This is an emer- 
gency, red A top priority. Get over 
here now as absolutely fast as you 
can. 

‘‘Of course.” She was on her 
feet instantly, ready to go. ‘‘Where 
are you?” 

‘‘The location of this lab?” I 
asked, turning to Professor 
Coypu. 

‘‘Level one-hundred and twelve. 
Room thirty.” 

‘‘Did you get that,” I said, turn- 
ing back to the screen. 

Which was blank. 

‘‘Angelina — ” . 

I jabbed the disconnect, tapped 
her code on the keys. The screen lit 
up. With the message: THIS IS 
AN UNCONNECTED NUM-

IF 




BER- Then I ran for the door. 
Someone clutched at my shoul- 
der, but I brushed him aside, 
grabbed the door and flung it open. 

There was nothing outside. A 
formless, colorless nothing that 
did strange things to my brain 
when I looked k it. Then the door 
was pulled from my hand and 
slammed shut and Coypu stood 
with his back to it, breathing heav- 
ily, his features twisted by the 
same unnameable sensations I 
had felt. 

“Gone,” he said hoarsely. “The 
corridor, the entire station, all 
the buildings, everything. Gone. 
Just this laboratory is left; locked 
here by the time-fixator. The Spe- 
cial Corps no longer exists; no one 
in the galaxy has even a memory 
of us. When the time-fixator goes 
we go as well.” 

“Angelina, where is she — where 
are they all?” 

“They were never boro, never 
existed.” 

“But I can remember her — all of 
them.” 

“That is what we count upoi). As 
long as there is one person alive 
with memories of us, of the Corps, 
we stand a microscopic chance of 
eventual survival. Someone must 
stop the time attack. If not for the 
Corps, for the sake of civilization. 
History is now being rewritten. 
But not inflexibly, if we can coun- 
terattack.” 

A one-way trip back to a life- 
time on an dien world, in an alien 



time. Whoever went would be the 
loneliest man alive, living thou- 
sands of years before his people, 
his friends, would even be borji. 

“Get ready,” I said. “I’ll go.” 

II 

(i'E'lRST we must find out 

-T where you are going. And 
when.” 

Professor Coypu staggered 
across the laboratory and I fol- 
lowed,^ in almost as bad shape. He 
was mumbling over the accordion 
sheets of the computer printout 
that were chuntering and pour- 
ing from the machine and piling 
up on the floor. 

“Must be accurate, very 
accurate,” he said. “We have been 
running a time probe backward. 
Following the traces of these dis- 
turbances. We have found the par- 
ticular planet. Now we must zero 
in on the time. If you arrive too 
late they may have already fin- 
ished their job. Too early and you 
might die of old age before the 
fiends are even born.” 

“Sounds charming. What is the 
planet?” 

“Strange name. Or rather 
names. It is called Dirt or Earth or 
something like that. Supposed to 
be the legendary home of all man- 
kind.” 

“Another one?, I never heard of 
it.” 

“No reason you should. Blown 
up in an atomic war ages ago. Here 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT SAVES THE WORLD

it is. You have to be pushed back- 
wards thirty-two thousand, five 
hundred and ninety-eight years. 
We can’t guarantee anything bet- 
ter than a plus or minus three 
months at that distance.” 

”I don’t think I’ll notice. What 
year will that be?” 

“Well before our present calen- 
dar began. It is, I believe, 1975 
A.D. by the primitive records of 
the aborigines of the time.” 

“Not so aboriginal if they’re fid- 
dling with time travel.” 

“Probably not them at all. 
Chances are the people you are 
looking for are just operating in 
that period.” 

“How do 1 find thfipi?!’ 

“With this.’’ One of the 
assistants handed me a small 
black box with dials and buttons 
on it, as well as a transparent 
bulge that contain^ a free-float- 
ing needle. The needle quivered 
like a hunting dog and continued 
to. point in the same direction no 
matter how I turned the box. 

“A detector of temporal energy 
generators,” Coypu said. “A less 
sensitive and portable version of 
our larger machines. Right now it 
is pointing at our time-helix. 
When you arrive at this planet. 
Dirt, you will use it to seek out the 
people you want. This other dial is 
for field strength and will give you 
an approximation of the distance 
to the energy source.” 

I looked at the box and felt the 
first bubbling and seething of an 



idea. “If I can carry this I can take 
other equipment with me, right?” 

“Correct. Small items that can 
be secured close to your body. The 
time field generates a surface 
charge that is not unlike static 
electricity.” 

“Then I’ll take whatever wea- 
pons or armament you have here 
in the lab.” 

“There is not very much. We 
have only the smaller items.” 

“Then I’ll make my own. Are 
there any weapons technicians 
working here?” 

He looked around and thou^t. 
“Old Jarl, there, was in the wea- 
pons sections. But we have no time 
to fabricate anythii^.” 

“That’s not what 1 bad in mind. 
Get him.” 

Old Jarl bad taken bis rejuvena- 
tion treatments recently so he 
looked like a world-soiled nine- 
teen-year-old — with an ancient 
and suspicious look in his eye as 
he came closer. 

“I want that box,” I said, point- 
ing to the memory unit on his 
back. He whinnied like a prodded 
pony and skittered away clutch- 
ing to the thing. 

“Mine, I tell you mine! You 
can’t have it. Not fair even to ask. 
Without it I’ll just fade away.” 
Tears of senile self-pity rose to his 
eyes. 

“Control yourself, Jarl. I don’t 
want to fade you out, I just want a 
duplicate of the box. Get cracking 
on it.”

IF 




He shambled away mumbling to 
himself and the technicians closed 
in. 

“I don’t understand,” Coypu 
said. 

‘‘Simple. If I am gunning after a 
large organization I may need 
some heavy weapon. If I do I’ll 
plug old Jarl into my brain and use 
his memories to build them.” 

“But — he will be you, take over 
your body — it has never been 
done.” 

“It’s being done now. Desper- 
ate times demand desperate mea- 
sures. Which brings us to another 
important point. You said this 
would be a one-way trip through 
time and that I couldn’t return.” 

“Yes. The time-helix hurls you 
into the past. There will be no helix 
there to return you.” 

“But if one could be built there, 
I could return?” 

“Theoretically. But it has never 
been tried. Much of the equipment 
and materials would not be avail- 
able among the primitive natives.” 

“But if the materials were avail- 
able a time-helix could be built. 
Now who do you know that could 
build it?” 

“Only myself. The helix is of my 
own construction and design.” 

“Great. I’ll want your memory 
box too. Be sure you boys paint 
your names on the outside so I 
don’t hook up with the wrong spe- 
cialist.” 

The technicians grabbed for the 
professor. 



“The time-flxator is losing pow- 
er!” one of the engineers shouted 
in a voice fllled with rising hys- 
teria. “When the field goes down 
we die. We will never have existed. 
It can’t be — ” 

He screamed, then fell over as 
one of his mates gave him a face- 
ful of knockout gas. 

“Hurry!” Coypu shouted, “Take 
diGriz to the time-helix, prepare 
him—” 



T hey grabbed me and rushed 
me into the next room, shout- 
ing instructions at one another: 
They almost dropped me when 
two of the technicians vanished 
at the same moment. Most of the 
voices had hysterical over- 
tones — as well they might with the 
world coming to an end. Some of 
the more distant walls were al- 
ready becoming misty and vague. 
Only training and experience kept 
me from panicking too. I finally 
had to push them away from the 
emergency spacesuit they were 
trying to jam me into in order to 
close the fastenings myself. Pro- 
fessor Coypu was the only other 
cool one in the whole crowd. 

“Seat the helmet but leave the 
faceplate open until the last min- 
ute. That’s fine. Here are the mem- 
ories — I suggest the leg. pocket

your chest. The temporal detec- 
tor here — ” 

There was more like this until I 
could hardly stand. I didn’t com- 
plain. If I didn’t take it — I 
wouldn’t have it. Hang on more. 

“A language unit,” I said. “How 
can I speak to the natives if I don’t 
know their language?” 

“We don’t have one here,’’ 
Coypu said, tucking a rack of gas 
containers under my arm. “But 
here is a memorygram — ” 

“They give me headaches.” 
“—that you can use to, learn the 
local tongue. In this pocket.” 
“What do I do? You haven’t ex- 
plained. How do I arrive?” 

“Very high. In the stratosphere 
that is. Less chance of colliding 
with anything material.- We’ll get 
you there. After that you’re on 
your own.” 

“The front lab is gone — ” some- 
one shouted, and popped out of 
existence at almost the same in- 
stant. 

“To the time-helix,’’ Goypu 
called out hoarsely and they 
dragged me through the door. 

Slower and slower, as the scien- 
tists and technicians vanished from 
sight like pricked balloons until 
there were only four of them left 
and, heavily burdened, I staggered 
along at a decrepit waddle. 

“The time-helix,’’ Coypu said 
breathlessly. “It is a bar, a col- 
umn of pure force that has been 
warped into a helix and put under 
tension.” 



It was green and glittered and 
almost filled the room, a coiled 
form of sparkling light as thick as 
my arm. 

“It’s like a big spring that you 
have wound up.” 

“Yes, perhaps. We prefer to call 
it a time-helix. It has been wound 
up — put under tension, the force 
carefully calculated. You will be 
placed at the outer end and the re- 
straining latch release4. As you 
are flung into the past the helix will 
hurl itself into the future where 
the energies will gradually dis- 
sipate. You must go.” 

There were just three of us left. 
“Remember me,” the short dark 
technician called out. “Remem- 
ber Charli Nate. As long as you re- 
member me I’ll never — ” 

Coypu and I were alone, the 
walls going, the air darkening. 

“The end — touch it — ” he called 
out. Was his voice weaker? 

I stumbled, partly fell toward 
the glowing end of the helix, my 
fingers outstretched. There was 
no sensation, but when I touched 
it I was instantly surrounded by 
the same green glow, could barely 
see through it. The professor was 
at a console, working the con- 
trols, reaching for a rather large 
switch. 

Pulling it down.

aid. There are more ways to fail 
than to succeed, to gp mad than to 
stay sane, and I needed all my 
mental energies to find the right 
Course. So I existed and stayed 
relatively sane during the insane 
temporal voyage and waited for 
something to happen. After an 
immeasurable period of time 
something did. 

I ARRIVED. The ending was 
even more draihatic than the be- 
ginning of the journey .as every- 
thing happened all at once. 

I could move again. I could see 
again— the light blinded me at 
first — and I was aware of all the 
bodily sensations that had been 
suspended so long. 

More than that, 1- was falling. 
My long-paralyzed stomach gave 
a twist and the adrenalin and like 
substances that my brain had been 
longing to pour into my blood for 
the- past 32,598 years — give or take 
three months — pumped in and my 
heart began to thud in a healthily 
excited manner. As 1 fell 1 turned 
and the sun was out of my eyes and 
1 looked out. at a black sky and 
down at fluffy white clouds far be- 
low. Was this it? Dirt, the myster- 
ious homeland of mankind? 
There was no telling, but it was 
still a distinct pleasure to be 
somewhere and somewhen with- 
out things dissolving around me. 
All of my equipment seemed still 
to~be with me and when 1 touched 
the control on my wrist 1 could feel 



the tug of the grav-chute taking 
hold. Great. 1 turned it off and 
dropped free again until I felt the 
first traces of thin atmosphere 
pulling at the suit. By the time I 
came to the clouds I was falling 
gently as a leaf, plunging feet first 
into their wet embrace. 1 slowed 
the rate of fall even more as 1 
dropped blind, rubbing at the con- 
densation on the faceplate of the 
spacesuit. Then I was out of the 
clouds, turned the control to hover 
and took a slow look around at this 
new world, perhaps the home of 
mankind, surely my home forever. 

Above me the clouds hung like a 
soft wet ceiling. There were trees 
and countryside about 3, BOO 
meters below, the Retails blurred 
by my wet faceplate! 1 had to try 
the atmosphere here sooner or la- 
ter and, hoping my remote ances- 
tors were not methane breathers', 
1 cracked the faceplate and took a 
quick sniff. 

Not bad. Gold and a little thin at 
this height, but sweet and fresh. 
And it didn’t kill me. 1 opened the 
faceplate wide, breathed deeply 
and looked down at the world be- 
low. Pleasant enough from this 
altitude. Rolling green hills cov- 
ered with trees of some kind, blue 
lakes, roads cutting sharply 
through the valleys, some sort of 
city on the horizon boiling out 
clouds of pollution. I’d stay as far 
away from that as possible for the 
time being. I had to establish 
myself first, see about . 



16 



IF 




the sound bad been pushing at 
my awareness, a thin humming 
like an insect. But there shouldn’t 
hav6 been insects at this altitude. 
I would.have thought of this sooner 
if my attention hadn’t been on the 
landscape below. Just about the 
time I realized this the humming 
grew to a roar and I twisted to 
look over my shoulder. Gaping. 
At the globular flying craft sup- 
ported by an archaic rotating 
airfoil of some kind, behind the 
transparent sides of which sat a 
man gaping back at me. 1 
slammed the wrist controller to 
LIFT and shot back up into the 
protecting cloud. 

Not a good beginning. The pilot 
had had a fii^e look at me, al- 
though there was always the 
chance that he might have disbe- 
lieved what he had seen. But he had 
believed. The communicators in 
this age had to be most sophisti- 
cated, the military’s preparedness 
or paranoia equally so, because 
within a few minutes I heard the 
rumble of powerful jets below. 
They circled a bit, roaring and 
bellowing,^ and one even shot up 
through the clouds. I had a quick 
glimpse of an arrow-like silver 
form before it was gone, the 
clouds roiling and seething in its 
wake. 

It was time to leave. The lateral 
control on a grav-chute isn’t too 
precise but 1 wobbled off through 
the clouds to put as much room be- 
tween myself and those machines 



as I could. When I had - not heat'd 
them for some time I risked a drop 
down just below the cloud levej. 

Nothing. In any direction. I 
snapped my faceplate shut and cut 
all the power; 

The drop in free fall could not 
have taken very long, though it 
seemed a lot longer. I had un- 
healthy visions of detectors 
clattering, computers digesting 
the information and pointing 
mechanical fingers, mighty ma- 
chines of war whistling and roar- 
ing toward me. I rotated as I fell, 
squinting my eyes for the first 
sight of shining metal. 

Nothing at all happened. Some 
large white birds flapped slowly 
along, veering off with sharp 
squawks as I plunged by. There 
was the blue mirror of a lake be- 
low and I gave a nudge of power 
that moved me toward it. If the 
pursuit did show up I- could drop 
under the surface and out of de- 
tection range. When I was below 
the level of the surrounding hills 
with the water rushing up uncom- 
fortably close below, I slammed 
on the power. I shuddered and 
groaned and felt the straps cutting 
deep into my flesh. The grav-chute 
on my back grew uncomfortably 
warm, though 1 began to sweat for 
a different reason. It was still a 
long fall — to .water hard as steel 
from this height. 

W HEN I Anally did stop mov- 
ing, my feet were in the wa-

ter. Not a bad lairing ait all’ There 
was still 1)6 sign of pursuit as I 
lifted a bit above the surface and 
drifted toward the gray cliff that 
fell directly into the lake on the far 
side. The air smelled good when I 
opened the faceplate - again — and 
everything was silent. No voices, 
no sounds of machines. Nor signs 
of human habitation. When I 
came closer to the shore I heard the 
wind in the leaves but. that was all. 
Great. I needed a place to hole up 
until I, got my barings and this 
would do just fine. The gray clifi- 
tumed out to be a wall of solid 
rock. Inaccessible and high. I 
drifted along its face until I found 
a ledge wide enough to !sit on, so I 

sat. It felt good. 

~^*Been a long time since t sat 
down," I said aloud, pleased to 
hear my voice. Yeah, my evil sub- 
conscious snapped- 4 >ack, about 
thirty-three thousand years. I was 
depressed again and wishod that I 
hs^ a drink. But that was the one 
essential item I had neglected to 
bring, a mistake I would have to 
rectify quickly . 

With the power cu^, the 
spacesuit began to warm up in the 
sun and I stripped it off, placing 
all the items of equipment against 
the rock far from the edge. 

What next? I felt Something 
crunch in my side pocket and 
pulled out a handful of hideously 
expensive and broken cigars. A 
tragedy. By some miracle few 
were intact. I snapped the end to 



ignite it and breathed deeply. 
Wonderful! I smoked for a bit, 
my legs dangling over the drop be- 
low, and let my morale build up to 
its normal, highly efficient level. 
A fish broke through the surface 
of the lake and splashed back; 
some small birds twittered in the 
trees and I thought about the next 
step. I needed shelter, but the 
more I moved aroui^ to find it the 
more chance I had of being dis- 
covered. Why couldn’t I stay right 
here? 

Among the assorted junk I had 
been draped with at the last min- 
ute was a laboratory tool called a 
masser. I had started to complain 
at the time, but it had been hung on 
my waist before I had managed 
to say anything..! considered it 
now. The handgrip that contained 
the power source blossomed out 
into a bulbous body which thinned 
again into a sharp, spikelike prod. 
A field was generated at the end 
that had the interesting ability of 
being able to concentrate most 
forms of matter by increasing 
the binding energy in the niole- 
cules. This would crunch thein to- 
getherinto a smaller space, though 
they of course, still had the same, 
mass. Some things, depending 
upon the material and the power 
used, could be compressed up to 
. one-half their original size. 

At the other end the ledge nar- 
rowed until it vanished. I walked 
along it as far as I safely could. 
Reaching out, I pressed the spike 



18 



IF 




to the surface of the gray stone 
and thumped the button. There 
a sharp crack as a compressed 
slab of stone the size of my hand 
fell from the face of the cliff* and 
slid down to the ledge. It felt heavy, 
more like lead than rock. Flipping 
it out into the lake, I turned up the 
power and went to work. 

Once 1 got the knack of the thing 
the job went fast. I found I could 
generate an almost spherical 
field that would detach a solid ball 
of compressed stone as big as my 
head. After I had struggled to roll a 
couple of these heavyweights over 
the edge — and almost rolled down 
with them — I worked the rock 
away at an angle, then cut out 
above this slope. 

The spheres would crunch free, 
bang down onto the slope and roll 
off the edge in a short arc, to splash 
noisily into the water below. 
Every once in a while I would stop, 
listen and look. 

1 was still alone. 

The sun was close to the horizon 
before 1 had a neat little cave in 
the rock face that would just hold 
all my goods and myself. An ani- 
mal’s den that 1 longed to crawl 
into. Which I did, after a quick 
floating trip down to the lake for 
some water. The concentrates 
were tasteless but filling, so my 
stomach knew that 1 had dined, 
though not well. As the first stars 
began to come out 1 planned the 
next step in my conquest of Dirt, 
or Earth, whichever the name was. , 



M y time voyage 'must have 
been more fatiguing than I 
bad thought. The next thing I real- 
ized was that the sky was black and 
a great orange fuU moon was sit- 
ting on the mountains. My bot- 
tom was chilled from contact with 
the cold rock and I was stiff from 
sleeping in a cramped sitting posi- 
tion. 

Come mighty changer of his- 
tory, I groaned as my muscles 
creaked and my joints cracked. Get 
out and get to work. 

That was exactly what I had to 
do. Action would bring reaction. 
As long as I holed up in this den 
any planning I might do would be^ 
valueless since I had no facts to 
operate with. As yet 1 didn’t even 
know if this was the right world, or * 
the right time — or anything else. I 
had to get out and get cracking. 
Though there was one thing that I 
could do — that I should have done 
first thing upon arrival. Mum- 
bling curses at my own stupidity, 

1 dug through the assorted junk I 
had brought with me and came up 
with the black box of the time-en- 
ergy detector. 1 used a small 
light to illuminate it and my heart 
thudded down on top of my stom- 
ach when 1 saw that the needle was 
floating limply. Time was not be- 
ing warped anywhere on this 
world. 

“Ha-ha you moron,’’ 1 called 
out loudly, cheered by- the sound 
of the voice I liked the most, “This 
thing would work a lot better if 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT SAVES THE WORLD 



19 




you turned on the power.” An 
oversight. Taking a deep breath, I 
threw the swhdi. 

Still nothing. The needle hung 
as limp as my deflated hopes. 
There was still a good chance that 
the time triflers were around and 
just happened to have their ma- 
chine turned olT at the present mo- 
ment. I hoped. 

To work. I secreted a few handy 
devices about my person and dis- 
engaged the grav-chute from the 
spaoesuit. It still had about a half 
charge in its power pack, which 
should me up and down the cliff 
a number of times. I slipped my 
arms through the straps, stepped 
off the le^ and touched the con- 
trols so that my fall_changed to an 
arc that pointed in* the direction 
of the nearest road I had seen on 
the way down. Floating low over 
the trees, I checked landmarks 
and direction constantly. The 
outsize and gleamingly bedialed 
watch I always wear on my left 
wrist does a lot more things than 
ten the time. A touch of the right 
button illuminated the needle of 
the radio compass that was zeroed 
in on my home base. I drifted 
silently on. 

Moonlight reflected from a 
smooth surface that cut through 
the forest and I floated to the 
ground. Enough light filtered 
through the boughs for me not to 
need my flash as I made my way to 
the road, covering the last few 
meters with extreme caution. It 



was empty in both directions and 
the night was silent. I bent and ex- 
amined the surface. It was made 
of some hard white substance, not 
metal or plastic, that appeared 
to have tiny grains of sand in it. 
Most uninteresting. Staying 
close to the edge I turned in the di- 
rection of the city I had glimpsed 
and started walking. Progress 
was slow but I was saving the pow- 
er in the grav-chute. 

What happened next I can at- 
tribute only to carelessness, 
tempered with fatigue, and sea- 
soned by my ignorance of this 
world. My mind wandered to An- 
gelina and my friends in the 
Corps, all of whom existed only 
in my thoughts. They now had no 
more reality than my memory of 
characters I had read about in a 
noveK This was a very depressing 
idea and I brooded over it rather 
than rejecting it, so I was taken 
completely unaware by the sud- 
den roar of' engines. At this mo- 
ment I was rounding a turn in the 
road that had apparently been 
blasted through a small hill, since 
there were steep banks on each 
side. I should have considered be- 
ing caught in this cut and have 
planned some means to avoid it. 
Now, while I considered the ad- 
visability of climbing the slope, 
of lifting up by grav-chute or us- 
ing some other means of escape, 
bright lights shone around the turn 
ahead and the roar grew louder. In 
the end I only dropped to one side 



20 



IF 




of the road, into the ditch that ran 
there, lay down and tried to think 
smalt, burying my face in my arm. 
My clothing was a neutral dark 
srav and might blend into th^ 
ground. 

Then the shuttering roar was 
upon me, next to me. Bright lights 
washed over me and were gone. I 
sat up and looked after the four 
strange vehicles that had passed. 
Details were not clear, since I saw 
them only as silhouettes against 
their own headlights, but they 
seemed very narrow, like mono- 
cycles, and e^h had a little red 
light at the back. Their sound qui- 
eted, became mixed with a kind of 
honking like some animal sound 
and a shrill screeching. They were 
slowing. Th^t must have seen me. 
Cracking, barking sounds 
echoed in the cut as the lights 
turned full circle and headed back 
in my direction. 

IV 

W HEN in doubt let the other 
guy make the first mistake: 
one of my older mottos. I could 
attempt to escape, climbing or 
floating, but whoever these peo- 
ple were they might have weapons 
and I would make a peachy target. 
Even if I did escape I would only 
draw attention to this area. Bet- 
ter to see who and what they were 
first. Turning my back, so their 
lights wouldn’t blind me, I waited 
patiently as the machines rum- 



bled up and stopped in an arc 
around me, motors coupling and 
lights pointed at me. I dos^ my 
eyes to slits to shield them from the 
glare and listened to the shange 
sounds the riders niade gabbling 
to each other, not one word of 
which I found comprehensible. 
The chances were good that my 
clothing was on the exotic side as 
far as they were concerned. They 
must have reached some agree- 
ment because the ei^ine on one 
of the invisible conveyances 
clattered into silence and the 
driver stepped forward into the 
light. 

We exchu^ed looks mutnak 
interest. He was a Kttte shfMter 
than- 1 but looked taller because 
of the bucket-shaped metal hek- 
met he was wearing. It was 
studded with rivets smd bom a tali 
spike on the top, very unattrac- 
tive, as was the rest of his dress. Alt 
black plastic with shining knobs 
and clasps, brought to the acme of 
vulgarity by a stylized skull and 
crossbones on the chest that was> 
picked out with fake gems of some 
kind. 

"Kryzl prtzblk?” he said in an 
insulting manner, allowing his jaw 
to protrude at the same time. I 
smiled to show that I was a friend- 
ly, good-natured fellow and re- 
sponded in the warmest fashion. 

“You’ll look uglier dead than 
alive, bowb, and that’s what you. 
will be if you keep talkii^ to me 
that way.’’ 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT SAVES THE WORLD

He looked puzzled at that and 
there was more incomprehensi- 
ble chit-chat back and forth. The 
first driver was joined by one of 
the others, equally strangely 
garbed, who pointed excitedly to 
my arm. All of them looked at my 
wrist chronometer and there were 
shrill cries of interest that 
changed to anger when I put my 
hand behind my back. 

“Prubl!” the first thug said, step- 
ping forward with his hand out. 
There was a sharp snik and a 
gleaming blade .appeared in his 
other fist. 

Now this was language I un- 
derstood and I almost smiled at 
the sight. No honest men these, 
ui^ess the la>v of the land decreed 
drawing weapons on strangers . 
and attempting to rob them. Now 
that I knew the rules I coiild play 
by them. 

"Prubl, prubl?” I cried, shrink- 
ing away and raising my hands in 
a gesture of despair. 

“Prubl drubir the evilly grin- ' 
ning lout shouted jumping- to- 
wards me. 

“How’s that for prubl?" I asked 
as I kicked up and caught him on 
the wrist with my toe. The knife 
sailed away into the darkness and 
he squeak^ with pain, the squeak 
turning into a vanishing gurgle 
as my pointed fingers stabbed him 
in the throat. 

By this time all the eyes must be 
On me so 1 triggered a miniflare 
into my hand from my sleeve hold- 



put and dropped it to the ground, 
before me, closing my eyes just 
before it exploded. The glare 
burned hot on my lids and I saw lit- 
tle floating blobs of light when I 
opened them again. I fared a lot 
better than my attackers, who 
were all temporarily blinded, if 
their groans and complaints 
meant anything. None of them 
stopped me as I walked behind 
them and gave each in turn a sharp 
boot where it would do the most 
good. They all yiped with pain and 
ran in little circles until two col- 
lided by chance and began to beat 
each other unmercifully. While 
they were amusing themselves in 
this manner I examined their con- 
veyances. Strange things with on- 
ly two wheels and no sign of a gyro 
to stabilize them in motion. Each 
had a single seat on which the 
operator sat, straddling the thing 
to make it go. They looked very 
dangerous and I had no desire at 
all to learn to operate one. 

What was 1 to do with these 
creatures? I had never enjoyed 
killing people, so they couldn’t be 
silenced that way. If they were the 
criminals they appeared to be, 
there was a good chance they 
would not report the event to the 
authorities. Criminals! Of 
course, just the kind of infor- 
mants I needed. One would be 
enough — the first one preferably 
since I would have no compunc- 
tion about being stern with him. 
He was moaning his way back to 



22 



IF 




consciousness, but a whiff of 
sleepgas put him well under. 
Around his waist was a wide, met- 
al-studded bdt that looked fairly 
strong. I fastened this to one of my 
belt clips and held him in friendly 
embrace under the arms. Then 
thumbed the grav-chute control. 

OILENTLY and smoothly we 
l3lifted, floating up and away 
from the noisy little group, ar- 
rowing back toward my lakeside 
retreat. Their companion’s van- 
ishing act would be singularly 
mysterious and even if they re- 
ported it to the authorities they 
would accomplish nothing. I was 
going to hole up with my dozing 
companion for a few days and 
learn the speech of this land. My 
accent was sure to be of the low- 
est, but that could be corrected la- 
ter. My retreat gaped its welcom- 
ing mouth at me and 1 zipped in, 
dropping my limp burden un- 
gracefully on the stone. 

By the time he came groaning 
back to awareness 1 was com- 
pletely prepared and had all the 
equipment laid out. 1 pufled pleas- 
urably on a cigar from my pock- 
et humidor and said nothing 
while he went through a painful se- 
ries of adjustments. There was 
plenty of lip-smacking before he 
opened his eyes and sat up, only to 
moan and clutch at his head. My 
sleep gas does have some painful 
after-effects. But memory of his 
knife aimed at me did much to steel 
me to his suffering. Then came 

THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT 



the wild look around, the bog- 
gling at me and my equipment, the 
crafty look at the black opening of 
the entrance and the apparently 
accidental way he got his 1^ be- 
neath him. To spring out of the 
opening. To land smash bn his 
face as the cable that secur^ his 
ankle to the rock brought him 
down. 

’’Now the games are over and we 
get to work,” I told him, not un- 
kindly, as I sat him back agaipst 
the wall and tightened the device 
about his wrist. I had rigged it 
while he slept and it was simple 
but effective. It contained a., 
blood pressure and skin resis- 
tance gauge with readouts On the 
control box that I held before me. 
A basic form of lie detector. It 
also contained a negative rein- 
forcement circuit. I normally 
wouldn’t use this technique on a 
human being— it was usually re- 
served for training laboratory 
animals — but this present human 
being was an exception. We were 
playing by his rules and this short- . 
cut would save a lot of time. When 
he began shouting what I am sure 
were obnoxious insults and stOrtSd 
to tear at the box I pressed the re- 
inforcement button. He shrieked 
and thrashed about enthusiastical- 
ly as the electric current hit him. 
It wasn’t really that bad; I had 
tried it on myself and set the level 
at slightly painful, the sort of pain 
one could easily endure biit would 
prefer not to. 

“Now we begin,” I said, “but 
SAVESTHE WORLD 23 




let me prepare myself first.” 

He looked on in wide-eyed si- 
lence while I adjusted the metal 
pads of the memorygram on my 
temples and activated the circuit. 

‘‘The key word is — ” I looked at 
my companion — ‘‘ugly. Now we 
begin.” 

There was a pile of simple ob- 
jects at my side and I picked up the 
first one and held it out before- me 
so he could see it. When he looked 
at it I said rock loudly, then was 
sUent. He was silent as well and 
after a moment I triggered the 
reinforcement circuit and he 
jumped at the sudden burst of pain 
and looked around wildly. 

‘‘Rock,” I repeated in a quiet, 
patient voice. 

It took him a while to get the 
idea, but he learned. There was a 
shock for cursing or saying any- 
thing irrelevant, and a double 
shock when he tried to lie about a 
word; my polygraph kept me in- 
formed about that. He had enough 
of this quite quickly and found it 
easier to supply the word I 
wanted. We quickly ran through 
my supply of objects and shifted 
to drawings and acted out mo- 
tions. I accepted the phr^e I don’t 
know— .as long as it wasn’t used 
too often — and my store of words 
grew. Under the pressure of the 
microcurrents of the memory- 
gram the new vocabulary was 
jammed into my cortex, but not 
without some painful side ef- 
fects. When my head began to 



throb I took a painpill and went 
on with the word game. It didn’t 
take long to file away enough 
words to switch to the second part 
of the learning process, grammar 
and structure. What is your namdt 
I thought to myself and added the 
code word ugly. 

“What . '. name?” I said aloud. 
A very unattractive, language in- 
deed. 

“Slasher.” 

“Me . name . Jim.” 

“Lemme go, I ain’t done nuttin 
to you.” 

“Learn first . leave later. Now 
tell, what year?” 

“What year what?” 

“Wha| year now, dum-dum?” 

I REPEATED the question in 
difierent ways until r^ization 
of what I was asking finally 
penetrated the solid bone of his 
skull. I was beginning to sweat. 

“Oh, the year. It’s nineteen-sev- 
enty-five. Yes, June the nineteenth, 
nineteen-seventy-five.” 

Right on the target! Across all 
those centuries and millennia 
the time-helix had snapped me 
with precise accuracy. I made a 
mental note of thanks to Profes- 
sor Coypu and the other van- 
ished scientists and, since they 
lived on only in my memory, this 
was probably the only way to send 
the message. Much cheered by this 
information 1 got on with the lan- 
guage lesson. 

The memorygram clutched onto 



24 



IF 




everything he said, organized it 
and jammed it deep into my 
bruised synapses. I stifled a 
groan and took another painpill. 
By sunrise I felt I had enough 
command of the language to add 
to it by myself and switched ofl* 
the machine. My companion fell 
over, asleep, and clunk^ his head 
on the rock without waking. I let 
him sleep and disentangled us 
both from the electronic equip- 
ment. After the nightlong session 
I was tired myself< but a stimtab 
took care of that. Hunger growled 
plaintively in my gut and I broke 
out some rations. Slasher awoke 
soon after and shared my break- 
fast, eating one of the bars only 
after he saw me break off the end 
and consume it myself. I belched 
with satisfaction and he echoed 
eructingly. He eyed me and my 
equipment for some time before 
he made a positive statement. 

“I know who you are.” 

‘‘So tell me.” 

‘‘You’re from Mars, dat’s 
what.” 

‘‘What’s Mars?”' 

‘‘The planet, you know.” 

‘‘Yeah, you might be right. It 
don’t matter. You gonna do what 
I said, help me get some loot?” 

‘‘I told you. I’m on parole. If 
I’m grabbed they’ll throw the key 
away.” 

‘‘Don’t let it bug you. Stick with 
me and they won’t lay a finger on 
you. You’ll be 'rolling in bucks. Do 
you have any of these bucks? I 



want to see what they look like.^’ 

“No!” he said, and his hand 
went to a bulge in a flap of materi- 
al afflxed to his lower garments. 
By this time I could detect his sim- 
ple lies without my equipment. 

Sleepgas quieted hiin and I 
worked a sort of hide envelope 
from his clothing that contain^ 
flimsy scraps of green paper, un- 
doubtedly the bucks he. had re- 
ferred to not having. To look at 
them was to laugh! The cheapest 
copying machine could turn out 
duplicates of these by the barrel- 
ful — unless there were hidden 
means for authentication. To 
check I went over them wifli the 
most delicate equipment and 
found no trace of chemical, physi- 
cal or radioactive identifica- 
tion. Amazing. The paper did ap^ 
pear to contain short threads of 
some kind of substance, but a du- 
plicator would print replicas of 
these on the surface which would 
do fine. If only I had a duplica- 
tor. Or did I have a duplicator? 
Toward the end Professor Coy- 
pu and his helpers had been hang- 
ing every kind of equipment on 
me that they could. I rooted 
through the pile and, sure enough, 
there was a tiny duplicator. It 
was loaded with a block of ex- 
tremely dense material that was 
expanded in some cellular fash- 
ion inside the machine to pro- 
duce a sheet'of smooth white plas- 
tic on which the copies were made. 
After a number of adjustments I 



THE STAI NLESS STEEL RAT SAVES THE WORLD 



25 




managed to reduce the quality of 
the .pl^tk uittd it was as rough 
and crumpled as the bucks. Now 
when I touched the copy button 
the machine produced a buck that 
appeared a duplicate of the prigi- 
nal. The largest denomination, 
Slasher had was a ten buck note 
and I made a number of copies of 
this. Of course they all had the 
same serial number, but my ex- 
perience has been that people 
never look very closely at the 
money they accept. 

I T WAS time to move into the 
next phase of my. penetration 
of the society on this, primitive 
planet, Earth. (I- had discovered 
that Dirt was nofcbrrect.and had 
another meaning altogether.) I 
arranged about my person the, 
equipment I might n^ and left 
the remainder in the cave with the 
spacesuit. It would be here when- 
ever I needed it. Slasher mum- 
bled and snored when I floated him 
back across the lake and low over 
the trees towards the road. There 
was more trafflc on it now during 
the day, I could hear the vehicles 
rumbling by, so I once more 
dropped into the forest. Before 
waking Slasher I buried the grav- 
chute with a radio transponder 
that would lead me back to it if 
need be. 

“What, what?” Slasher asked, 

' sifting up as soon as the, antidote 
took effect. He looked uncom- 
prehendingly around at the forest. 



“On your hoofs,” I told him. 
“We gotta move out of here.” 

He shambled after me, still half 
asleep, though he woke up rather 
quickly when I ruffled the wad of 
money under his nose. 

“How do these bocks look to 
you?” - V 

‘Ujreat — but I thought you 
didn’t have any bread?” 

“I got enough food, but not 
enough money. So I made these. 
Are they okay?” 

“A-okay, I never seen better.” 
He flipped through them with the 
appraising eye of the profes- 
sional. “The only way you can 
tell is that the numbers are all the 
same. This is high-class green.” 

He parted with them only re- 
luctantly. A man of little 
imagination and ho compunc- 
tion; just what I heieded. The sight 
of the bucks seemed to have driven 
all fear of me from him and he ac- 
tively joined in planning to ob- 
tain even more money as we 
trudged along the road. 

“That outfit you’re wearing, it’s 
okay from a distance, like now, no 
one in the cars notices nuttin. But 
we gotta get you some threads. 
There’s kind of a general .store 
foot of this hill. You wait away 
from the road while I go in and buy 
what you need. In fact maybe we 
get some wheels before that, my 
feet are killing me. There’s some 
kind of little factory there with a 
parking lot. We’ll see what they’re 
selling.” 



26 



IF 




The factory proved to be a squat 
squarish building with a number 
of chimneys that were pufHng out 
smoke and pollution. An assort- 
ment of multicolored vehicles 
were arrai^ed to one side and, fol- 
lowing Slasher’s example, 1 
bent low as we moved quickly to 
the nearest one in the outside 
row. When he was sure we were un- 
observed my companion re- 
leased a catch on a swollen purple 
thing, with what appeared to be a 
row of metal teeth at one end, and 
lifted a large lid< I looked in and 
gasped at the excessively com- 
plex and primitive propulsion en- 
gine it contained. I was indeed in 
the past. In response to my ques- 
tions, Slasher described it as he 
shorted some wires that seemed to 
control the ignition. 

“An intoinal combustion en- 
gine we call it. Almost new, should 
be three hundred horses there. 
Climb in and we’ll make tracks out 
of here before anybody sees us.’’ 

I made a mental note to inquire 
later about the theory behind this 
intoinal combustion. From earli- 
er conversation I understood 
that horses were a rather large 
quadruped, so perhaps it was an 
animal-miniaturizing process to 
get a large number of them into 
the machine. But, primitive as the 
device looked, it certainly moved 
quickly enough. Slasher manipu- 
lated the controls and twisted the 
large wheel and we shot out onto 
the road and were away — appar- 



ently without being detected. I 
was more than satisfied to let 
Slasher drive while I observed 
this world that I had arrived on. 

“Where is all the mon^ kept? 
You know, like the place where 
they lock it up.” 

“You must mean the banks. 
Places with thick walls, big vaults, 
armed guards. They got at least 
one in every town.” 

“And the bigger the town, the 
'bigger the bank?” 

“You’re catdiin on.” 

“Then drive on to the nearest 
big town and find the biggest 
bank. I need plenty of bread. So 
we’ll clean it out tonight.” 

Slasher gaped in awe. “You 
can’t mean it! They got all kinds of 
alarms and stuff.” 

“I laugh at their stone-age gad- 
gets. Just find the town, find the 
bank, then find some food and 
drink. Tonight I’ll make you 
rich.” 

V 

I N ALL truth I have never 
robbed a bank more easily, or 
cracked a simpler crib. The estab- 
lishment I selected was in the cen- 
ter of a city with the improbable 
sounding name of Hartford. It was 
severely constructed of gray stone 
and all the openings were covered 
with thick metal bars — ^but these 
defenses were negated by the fact 
that other buildings were joined to 
the bank on both sides. A rat rare-

ty enters by the front door. It was 
early evening when we set out and 
Slasher was jittery and nervous, 
despite the large quantity of low 
qudity alcoholic beverage he had 
consumed. 

“We oughta wait until later,” he 
complained. “Plenty of people are 
still in the street.” 

“Just how 1 want it. They won’t 
pay no attention to a couple more. 
Now park this heap around the 
corner where we planned and 
bring the bags.” 

I carried my tools in a small case 
while Slasher followed me with the 
two large pieces of luggage we had 
purchased. The buildii^ ahead, on 
the left of the bank, was dark and 
the outer doer was surely- locked. 
No trouble. 1 had looked rd the 
lock earlier in the day and had 
determined that it presented no 
problem at all. The device in my 
left hand neutralized the alarm 
while I inserted the lockpick with 
my right. It opened so easily that 
Slasher did not even have to stop 
but went right on by me with the 
bags. Not a soul in the street paid 
us the slightest attention. A 
corridor led to some more locked 
doors, which I passed through with 
the same ease, until we reached an 
ofHce in the rear. 

“This room should share a wall 
with the bank. Now I’m gonna And 
out,’’ I said. 

I whistl^ under my breath as I 
went to work. This was by no 
means my first bank robbery and I 



had no intention of making it my 
last. Of all the varied forms of 
crime, bank robbery is the most 
satisfactory to both the individual 
and to society. The individual of 
course gets a lot of mon^ — that 
goes without saying — and he bene- 
fits society by putting large 
amounts of cash back into circu- 
lation. The economy is stimulated, 
small businessmen prosper, people 
read about the crime with great in- 
terest, and the police have a chance 
to exercise their various Skills. 
Good for all. Though ( have heard 
foolish peo|rie complain that it 
hurts the bank. This is arrant non- 
sense. AH banks are insured, so 
they lose nothing, wfole the sums 
involved are mimMcule-m the over- 
all operation of the insuring firm, 
where the mori that hatypen 
is that a microscopically smaller 
dividend will be paid at the end of 
the year. Little enough price to pay 
for all the good caused. It was as a 
benefactor of mankind, not a thief, 
that I moved the echo sounder 
along the wall. A large opening on 
the other side; the bank without a 
doubt. 

There were a number of cables 
and pipes in the wall, power and 
water I presumed, along with 
some that were obviously alarms. I 
marked their positions on the wall 
until the pattern was clear. One 
area was free of all obstructions. I 
outlined it. 

“We go in here,” I said. 

“How we gonna break the wall 



28 



IF 




down?” Slasher swung between 
elation and fear, wanting the mon- 
ey, afraid he would be caught. He 
was obviously a petty criminal and 
this was the biggest job he had ev- 
er been on. 

“Not break, dum-dum,” I said, 
not unkindly, holding up the mass- 
er. “We just convince it to open 
before us.” 

Of course he had no idea what I 
was talking about, but sight of the 
gleaming instrument seemed to re- 
assure him. I had reversed the de- 
vice so instead of increasing the 
binding energy of molecules it re- 
duced their attraction close to zero. 
With slow precision I ran the point 
of the device completely over the 
chosen area of wall, then turned it 
off and stowed it away. 

“Nuttin happened,” Slasher 
conmlained. 

“Sotnetin will now.” I pushed 
the wall with my hand and the en- 
tire area I had prepared fell away 
with a soft whoosh, sliding down 
like so much fine dust. Which it 
had become. We looked through 
into the brightly lit interior of the 
bank. 



W E Were invisible from the 
street when we crawled 
through and crept along behind the 
high counter where the tellers 
normally sat. The builders had 
thoughtfully put their vault in the 
lower depths of the building and 
out of sight of the street, so once 



down the steps we could straighten 
up and go about our task in com- 
fort. In^ rapid sequence I went 
through a pair of locked doors and 
a grUl made of thick steel bars. 
Their locks and alarms were too 
simple to discuss. The vault door 
itself looked more formidable yet 
proved the simplest of them all. 

“Look at dat,” I called out en- 
thusiastically. “There is a time lock 
here that opens automatically 
sometime tomorrow.” 

“I knew it,” Slasher wailed. 
“Let’s get out before the alarms go 
off—” 

As he ran for the stairs I tripped 
him and put one foot on his chest 
while I explained. 

“That is whdt they call good, 
dum-dum. All we have to do to 
open the thing is to advance the 
clock so it thinks it is the morn- 
ing. 

“Impossible! It’s sealed behind a 
couple of inches of steel !” 

Of course he had no way of 
knowing that an ordinary service- 
man’s manipulator is designed to 
work through casings of any kind. 
When I felt the field engage the 
cogs I rotated it and the dials 
whirled and his eyes bulged— and 
the mechanism gave a satisfied 
click and the door swung open. 

“Bring da bags,” I ordered, en- 
tering the vault. 

Whistling and humming gaily we 
packed the two bags solid with the 
tightly wrapped bundles of crisp 
notes. Slasher closed and sealed his

firet, then mumbled impatiently 
at my slowness. 

“What’s da rush?” I asked him, 
closing the case and assembling my 
tools. “You gotta take the time to 
do things the right way.” 

As I put the last of my instru- 
ments away I noticed a needle 
jump, then hold steady. Interest- 
ing. I adjusted the Held strength 
then stood with it in my hand and 
looked around. Slasher was on the 
other side of the vault fumbling 
with some long metal boxes. 

“And what are you doing?” I 
asked in my warmest voice. 

“Takin a shufty to see if maybe 
there are some jewels in these safe 
deposit boxes.” 

“Oh, that is what you are doing. 
You shoulda asked me:” - 
“I cap do it myself.” Surly and 
cocksure. 

“Yes, but I can do it without set- 
ting off the silent alarm to the po- 
lice station.” Cold and angry. “As 
you have just done.” 

The blood drained from his face 
nicely, his hands shook so he 
dropped the box, then , he jumped 
about to bend and pick up the 
satchel of money. 

“Dum-dum yo-yo,” I snarled 
and booted hard the inviting target 
present^. “Now get that bag and 
get out of here and start the car. 
I’m right behind you.” 

Slasher stumbled and scrambled 
up the stairs and I followed more 
cdmly after, taking a moment to 
close all the gates and grUls behind 



me in order to make things as dif- 
flcult as possible for the police. 
They would know the bank had 
been entered, but would not know 
it had been robbed until they 
rousted out some bank official and 
opened the vault. By which time we 
would be long gone. 

But as I came up the stairs I 
heard the squeal of tires and saw, 
through the front windows, a po- 
lice car pulling up outside. 

They had certainly been fast, in- 
credibly so for an ancient and 
primitive society like this one. 
Though perhaps that was why; cer- 
tainly crime and crime detection 
must consume a large part of ev- 
eryone’s energies. However I 
wast^ no time philosophizing over 
their arrival, but pushed the bags 
ahead of me as I crawled behind 
the tellers’ counter. As I was going 
through the hole to the other build- 
ing 1 heard keys rattling in the 
outer door locks. Just right. As 
they came, in 1 would go out — and 
this proved to be the case. When I 
looked out at the street I saw that 
all of the occupants of the police 
car had entered the bank while a 
small, but curious, crowd had 
gathered. With their backs towards 
me. I exited slowly and strode to- 
wards the corner. 

These neolithic fuzz were cer- 
tainly fast on their feet. It must 
come from running down and 
catching their own game or some- 
thing. Because I had not reached 
the corner before they popped out 



30 



IF 




of the buOdii^ behind me, tooting 
painfully on shrill whistles. Th^ 
had ehtered the bank, seen the hole 
in the wall, then retraced my path. 
I took one quick look at them, all 
shining teeth, Uue uniforms, brass 
buttons and guns, and started run- 
ning. 

Around the comer and into the 
car. 

^cept that the street was empty 
and the car was gone. 

Slasher must have decided that 
he had earned enough for one eve- 
ning and had driven away and left 
me for the law. 



VI 

I AM not suggesting that I may 
be made of sterner stuft than 
most men. Though I do feel that 
most men when presented with a 
situation like this — 32,000 years in 
the past, a load of stolen money, 
the law in hot pursuit — might give 
way to more than a little sugges- 
tion of panic. Only conditionings 
and the fact that I had been in this 
position far too often during my 
life — kept me running smoothly 
while I considered what to do next. 
In a fev^ moments some heavy- 
footed minions of the law would 
come barreling around the corner 
while, I am sure, a radio alarm 
would be drawing in reinforce- 
ments to cut me off. Think fast, 
Jim. 

1 did. Before I had taken five 



more paces nay entire plan for es- 
cape was outlined, detailed, set in- 
to type, printed and bound into a 
little booklet with page one open in 
my mind’s before me. 

First— get off the street. As I 
jumped~into the next doorway I 
dropped the money and let a mini- 
grenade drop into my Angers from 
my holdout. This fttted into the 
round opening of the keyhole very 
nicely and, with an impressive 
thud, it blew out the lock and part 
of the frame. My pursuers were not 
in sight yet so I Imitated until they 
appeared before pushing open the 
ruined door. Hoarse shouts and 
more whistle Mowing signaled that 
I had been observed. The door 
opened into a long corridor and . I 
was at the far end of it, hands 
raised in surrender when the gun- 
toting law hesitatingly peeked in 
thropgh the opening. 

‘‘Doh*t shToot, coppers,” I 
shouted. ”1 surrender, a poor 
young man led to crime by evil 
companions.” 

‘‘Don’t move or we’ll hole you,” 
they growled happily, entering 
warily with strong lights flashing 
into my eyes. I simply atood there, 
fillers groping for empty air, until 
the lights slid away and there was 
the double thud of falling bodies. 
There should have been since there 
was more sleepgas than air in that 
hallway. 

Being careful to breathe through 
the filter plugs in my nostrils I 
stripped the uniform from the snor-

ii^ figure that was closest to my 
size; cursing the crude arrange- 
ment of fastenings, and put it on 
over my own clothes. Then I took 
the hand weapon ,he had been 
carrying and restored it to its 
holster, picked up my bags again 
and left, walking back up the street 
towards the bank. Frightened 
civUians peered out of doorways 
like animals from their burrows 
and at the corner I was met by 
another police car. As I had 
guessed a number of them were 
converging on this spot. 

“I have the loot,” I called in to 
the solid figure behind the wheel: 
‘T’m takin it back to da bank. We 
have them cornered, da rats, a 
whole gang. Through that door. Go 
get them!” — • 

This last advice was unneeded 
because the vehicle had already 
left. The first police conveyance 
still stood where I had last seen it 
and, under the cow-like eyes of the 
spectators, I threw the bags into 
the front seat and climbed in. 

“Gowan^ beat it. Da show’s 
over,” I shouts as I groped among 
the unfamiliar instruments. There 
were an awful lot of them, enough 
to fly a spaceship with let ajone 
this squalid groundcar. Nothing' 
happened. The crowd milled back 
then milled forward. I was 
sweating slightly. Only then did I 
notice that the tiny keyhole was 
empty and remembered — be- 
latedly — something Slasher had 
said about using keys to start these 



vehiclM; with. Sirens grew louder 
on all sides as I groped and 
fumbled through the odd selection 
of pockets and wallets on the uni- 
form I wore. 

Keys! An entire ring of them. 
Chortling I pushed one after an- 
other into the keyhole until I re- 
alized that they were all too big to 
fit. Outside the fascinated crowd 
pressed close, greatly admiring my 
performance. 

‘‘Back,-i)ack,” I cried, and strug- 
gled the weapon from its holster to 
add menace to my words. 



E vidently it had been 
primed and was ready to be ac- 
tuated and I inadvertently touched 
the wrong control. There was a 
terrible explosion, cloud of smoke 
and the weapon jumped from my 
hand. Some kind of projectile hur- - 
tled through the metal roof of the 
car and my thumb felt quite sore. 

At least the spectators left. Hur- 
riedly. As th^ ran in all directions 
I saw that one of the police cars 
was coming up behind me and I felt 
that things were just not going as 
well as they should. There must be 
other keys. 1 groped again, throw- 
ing the miscellaneous items I dis- 
covered onto the seat beside me 
until there were no more. The oth- 
er car stopped behind mine and the 
doors opened. 

Was that a glint of metal in that 
small hide case? It was. A pair of 
keys. One of them slid gently into

IF 




the correct oriflce as the two min- 
ions of law and order walked up on 
both sides of the car. 

“What’s going on here?” the 
nearest called- out as the key turned 
and there was the groaning of an 
engine and a metallic clashing. 

“Trouble!” I said as I fumbled 
with the metal levers. 

“Get outta there you!” he said, 
pulling out his- weapon. 

“Matter of life and death!”,! 
shouted in a cracked voice as I 
stamped on one of the pedals as I 
had seen Slasher do. The car 
'roared with power, the wheels 
squealed; it leaped to life, hurtling. 

In the wrong direction, back- 
ward. 

There was an intense crashing 
and clanging of glass and metal 
and the police vanished. I groped 
for the controls again. One of the 
fuzz appeared ahead, raising his 
weapon,l>ut jumped for his life as I 
found the right combination and 
the car roared at him. The road 
was clear and I was on my way. 

With the police in hot pursuit. 
Before ! reached the corner the 
other car started up and tore for- 
ward. Colored lights began rota- 
ting on top of it and its siren 
wailed. I drove with one hand and 
fumbled with my own controls — 
spraying liquid on the windscreen 
then seeing it wiped away by mov- 
ing arms, hearing loud music, 
warming my feet with a hot blast of 
air — until I also had a screaming 
siren and, perhaps, a flashing light. 



We tore down the wide road in this 
manner and I felt that this was not 
the way to esfcape. The police 
knew their city and their vehicles 
and could radio ahead to cut me_ 
OB'. As soon as I realized this I 
pulled at the wh6el and turned into 
the next street. Since I was going a 
bit faster than I should the tires 
screeched and the car bounced up 
onto the sidewalk and caromed off 
a building before shuddering back 
into the roadway. My pursuers 
dropped behind with this maneu- 
ver, not willing to make the turn 
in this same dramatic manner, but 
were still after me when I barreled 
around the next corner. With these 
two right-ai^le turns I had suc- 
ceeded in reversing my course and 
was now headed back toward the 
scene of the crime. 

W HICH may sound like mad- 
ness but was really the safest 
thing to do. In a few moments, si- 
ren wailing and lights going, I was. 
safe in the middle of a pack of 
screaming flashing blue and white 
vehicles. It was lovely. They were 
turning and backing and getting in 
each other’s way and I did what I 
could to increase the confusion. It 
was quite interesting with much 
cursing and the shaking of fists 
from windows and I would have 
stayed longer if reason had not pre- 
vailed. When the excitement 
reached its merriest I worked my 
way out and slid my vehicle around 
the corner. I was not followed. At a 



THE STAI NLESS STEEL RAT SAVES THE WORLD 



33 




more reasonable pace, siren si- 
lenced and lights lowered, I trun- 
dled along the street lookii^ for a 
haven. I could never escape in the 
pdke car and I had no intention of 
doing so; what 1 needed was a- rat 
hole to crawl into. 

A luxurious one, I do not be- 
lieve in doii^ things halfway. Not 
very much farther on I saw my 
goal, ablaze with lights and signs, 
glittering with ornament, a hotel of 
the plush and luxury class almost 
a stone’s throw from the site of the 
crime. The last (dace where I would 
be looked for. I hoped. Certain 
chances have to be taken always. 
At the next turning I parked the 
car, stripped off the uniform, put a 
bundle of bills in my pocket, then 
trundled back toward' the hotel 
with my two bags. When the car 
was found they would probably 
think I had changed vehicles, an 
obvious ploy, and the area of 
search would widen. 

“Hey, you,” I called out to the 
uniformed functionary who stood 
proudly before the entrance. “Car- 
ry these bags.” 

My tone was insulting, my man- 
ners rude and he would have ig- 
nored me had I not spoken in an- 
other language and pressed a large 
denomination banknote into his 
hand. A quick glimpse of this pro- 
duced smiles and a false obsequi- 
ousness as he grabbed for my bags, 
shuffling alter me as I entered the 
lobby. 

Glowing wood paneling, soft 



rugs, discreet lighting, lovely wom- 
en in low-cut dresses accompanied 
by elderiy men with low-hung bel- 
lies — this was the right place. 
There were a number of rais^ eye- 
brows at my rough clothing as I 
strode across to the reception desk. 
The individual behind it looked 
coldly down a loi^ patrician nose 
and I could see the ice already 
starting to form. I thawed it with a 
wad of money on the counter 
before him. 

“You have the pleasure of meet- 
ing a rich but eccentric million- 
aire,” I told him. “This is for 
you.” The bills vanished even as I 
offered them. "“I have just come 
back from the boonies and I want 
the best room you got.” 

“Something might be arranged, 
but only the Emperor Suite is 
available and that costs — ” 

' .“Don’t bodder me with money. 
Take this loot and let me know 
when you want more.” 

“Yes, Well, perhaps something 
can be arrai^ed. If you would be so 
kind as to sign your name here — ” 

“What’s your name?” 

“Me? Why, it’s Roscoe Amber- 
dexter.” 

‘‘Ain’t that a coincidence-^ 
that’s my name too, but you can 
caU me sir. Must be a very com- 
mon name around here. So you 
sign for me since we both got the 
same name.” 1 beckoqed and he 
leaned forward and I spoke in a 
hoarse whisper. “I don’t want no 
one to know I am here. Everyone’s 



34 



IF 




after my loot. Send up the man- 
ager if he wants more informa- 
tion.” What he would get would be 
money which I was sure would do 
just as well. 

Buoyed on a wave of greenbacks 
the rest was clear sailing. I was 
ushered to my quarters and I be- 
stowed largesse on my two bag- 
carriers for being so smart they 
hadn’t dropped them. They opened 
and shut things, showed me all the 
controls. I had one of them call 
room service for much food and 
drink. They left in the best of hu- 
mors, pockets bulging. I put the 
bag of money in the closet and 
opened the smaller case. 

And froze. 

The indicator needle on the tem- 
poral energy detector had moved 
and was pointing steadily toward 
the window and the world outside. 

VII 

M y hands wanted to shake 
but I would not let them as I 
took out the detector and placed it 
gently on the floor. The field 
strength was 117.56 and I made a 
rapid note of this. Then I dropped 
and sighted along the needle at the 
exact spot under the window where 
it pointed. Running over quickly, I 
marked a big X on this spot, then 
rushed back to check it. As I took 
the second sighting the needle be- 
gan to drift and the meter dropped 
to zero. 

But I had them! Whoever they 



were, they were operating out of 
this era. They had used their ap- 
paratus once and they were sure to 
use it again. When they did I would 
be waiting for them. For the first 
time since I had been shipped back 
to this crude barbarian world I was 
warmed a small spark of hope. 

After a hearty dinner and a 
snowfall of fluttering banknotes I 
went to sleep. Not for long though. 
A two-hour zonk pill put me under 
in the deepest possible sleep. I 
awoke feeling much more human. I 
found a number of interesting 
bottles in the bar in the next room, 
some of them rather palatable, and 
I sat down with a Hlled glass in 
front of a glass-eyed instrument 
called a teevee. As I had guessed 
my accent in the local language 
left a lot to be desired and I 
wanted td listen to someone who 
spoke a better form of it. 

This was not easy to find. To be- 
gin with it was hard to teil. which 
were the educational channels and 
which were there for entertain- 
ment. I found what appeared to be 
a morality play in historical form 
— all the men wore wide-brimmed 
hats and rode horses. But the total 
vocabulary used could not have 
been more than one hundred words 
and most of the characters were 
killed by shooting before I could 
discover what it was all about. 
Guns seemed to play an important 
role in most of the dramas I 
watched, though this was varied 
with sadism and assorted kinds of 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT SAVES THE WORLD 



35 




mayhem. AH this violence and hur- 
tling from one place to another in 
various conveyances did not leave 
the people much time for intersex- 
ual activity; a brief kiss was the 
only manifestation of affection or 
libido that I saw. Most of the 
dramas were also difficult to fol- 
low since they kept being inter- 
rupted by brief playlets and illus- 
trated lectures about the purchase 
of various consumer goods. By 
dawn I had had enough of this and 
my speech had improved only mi- 
croscopically so I kicked in tho 
glass picture tube as fitting com- 
ment and went to wash myself in a 
pink room filled with museum 
pieces out of the history of plumb- 
ing. 

As soon as the shops-opened in 
the morning I had a number of ho- 
tel employees at work with a great 
deal of money and my purchases 
soon poured in. New clothing to fit 
my high station, with expensive 
luggage to carry it in. Plus a num- 
ber of maps, a carefully made gad- 
get called a magnetic compass and 
a book on the principles of navi- 
gation. It was simplicity itself to 
determine the exact direction to 
which the detector had pointed and 
to transfer this to a local map and 
get a fairly good approximation of 
the distance in the measurement 
units called mUes to the source of 
the time energy field. A long black 
line on the map gave me my direc- 
tion, a slash across it to show dis- 
tance — and I had my target. The 



two lines crossed at udiat appeared 
to be a-major center of population, 
in fact the largest one on this map. 

It was called, quaintly. New 
York City. There was no indica- 
tion where Old York City was and 
it did not matter. I knew where I 
had to go. 

L eaving the hotel was more 
like a royal abdication than a 
simple parting and there were 
many glad cries for nie to hurry 
back. As well there might be. A 
hired car whirled me out to the 
airport and ready hands rushed my 
luggage to the proper exit. Where a 
rude shock was awaiting me, since 
I had completely forgotten about 
the bank robbery. Others had not. 

“Open up da bags," a grim look- 
ing defender of law and order said. 

‘‘Of course,” I said, very cheer- 
ily. I noticed that all the paissengers 
were being subjected to this same 
search. “Might I ask what you are 
looking for?” 

“Money. Bank robbery,” he 
muttered, poking through my pos- 
sessions. 

“I’m afraid I never carry large 
sums,” I said, holding the bag with 
my massed banknotes tight to my 
chest. 

“These are okay. Let’s see that 
one,” 

“Not in public if you please, of- 
ficer. I am a high-plac^ govern- 
ment ofi^al and these papers are 
top secret.” I quoted this word for 
word from the teevee. 



36 



IF 




“In the room,” he said, pointing. 

I was almost sorry I had kicked the 
thing in since it had been so edu- 
cational. 

In the room he looked shocked 
when I opened a sleepgas grenade 
rather than the bag and he slumped 
nicely. There was a large metal 
locker against the wall filled with 
the numerous forms and papers so 
dear to the bureaiicratic mind and, 
by rearranging them, I managed to 
make room for my snoring com- 
panion. The longer he remained un- 
discovered the better. Unless there 
were unforeseen delays I would be 
in New York City befor6 he re- 
gained consciousness — a process 
that would have to be a natural 
one since there would be no known ' 
antidote for my gas. 

When 1 left the room another of 
the uniformed ofHcials was glow- 
ering at me, so I turned and called 
back through the still open door. 
“Thank you for your kind aid — no 
trouble at all I assure you, no trou- 
ble at all.” 1 closed the door and 
smiled at the officer as I passed. He 
raised a reluctant fingertip to the 
visor of his cap and turned away to 
grab at the luggage of an elderly 
passenger. I went on with my bag, 
not too surprised to notice the 
finest of pricklings of sweat upon 
my brow. 

The flight was brief, uninterest- 
ing, noisy and rather too bumpy, in 
a great fixed-wing craft that ap- 
peared to be powered by jets burn- 
ing a liquid fuel. Though the smell 



of this fuel was everywhere — and 
familiar — I could not bring myself 
to believe that they were burning 
irreplaceable hydrocarbons. I had 
a moment of expectation when we 
disembarked, but there did not 
seem to be any alarm. Reaching 
the center of the city from the out- 
lying airport was a painful ordeal 
of hurtling vehicles, shouts, noise 
of all kinds, and it was with a feel- 
ing of great relief that I finally fell 
through the door of a cool hotel 
room. But once reason was re- 
stored by the quiet, plus a couple of 
belts of the distilled organ-de- 
stroyer I was becoming attached 
to, I was -more than ready for the 
next step. 

HICH would be what? Re- 
connoiter or attack? Sweet 
reason dictated a careful stalk of 
the time energy source to deter- 
mine what I was up against — who 
and what. 1 had half settled on this 
course and was berating myself 
mildly for even considering attack 
before the force of logic clanked 
through to its last link. I turned 
and pointed at myself in the mir- 
ror. 

“You are — ” I shook a dis- 
gusted finger at myself — “what the 
cab driver called the other cab 
driver. A joick and wpise.” 

I had only one advantage — sur- 
prise. Any bit of reconnoitering 
might tip my hand and the time 
warriors would know that they 
were under investigation, perhaps 




THE STAI NLESS STEEL RAT SAVES THE WORLD 



37 




attack. Sinc&they had launched the 
time war they were surely pre- 
pared for possible retaliation. But 
how can guards stay alert for weeks 
and months, possibly year's? Once 
they knew I was around, at this 
time and place, all sorts of extra 
precautions would be taken. To 
prevent this I had to hit and hit 
hard — even though I had no idea 
whom I was hitting. 

“Does it make a difference?” I 
asked, snapping open a grenade 
case. “It might be nice to satisfy 
my curiosity and find out who has 
attacked the Corps — and why? But 
is it relevant or important? The 
answer is no.” I glared across a 
small atomic fusion bomb at my 
red-eyed mirrored image and 
shook my head. “No, 'and no 
again. They must be destroyed, 
period. Now. Quickly.” 

There was no other course open 
to me, so calmly and surely I fitted 
about my body the most potent 
weapons of destruction devised by 
millennia of weapons research; 
always a favorite of mankind. 
Normally I am no believer in the 
kill or be killed school of thought: 
affair^ are usually not that black 
and white. But now they were and I 
felt not the slightest guilt over my 
decision. This was undeclared war 
against all mankind of the 
future — why else had the Special 
Corps been the first target of 
attack? Someone, some group, 
wanted control of everything, 
probably the most selfish and 



insane plan ever conceived, attd it 
did not really matter who or what 
they were. Deatii for them, before 
they killed everything of value. 

When I left the hotel I was a 
walking bomb, ah army of destruc- 
tion. The black box of the time 
energy detector was in the attach^ 
case I carried, the indicators visi- 
ble through holes I had cut in the 
lid. Somewhere out there was the 
enemy and when he moved I would 
be waiting. 

It was a short wait. An unseen 
burst of time energy was unleashed 
close by, if the action of the needle 
was any indication, and I was on 
the trail. Direction and distance, I 
worked out the vector as I plunged 
ahead, almost ignorant of the 
people and vehicles around me, but 
slowing and becoming more careful 
after a close miss by a lumbering 
truck. 

Now, a wide thoroughfare with 
green in the center of it, tall build- 
ings of a uniformly depressing de- 
sign, great slabs of metal and glass 
looming up in the polluted air. One 
very much like the other. Which 
one did I want? 

The needle swung again, quiver- 
ing with the intensity of its reac- 
tion, turning as I walked, the me- 
ter rising to a distance reading 
right at the top of its scale. 

There. In that building, the cop- 
per and black one. 

Ini went, prepared for anything. 

Anything that is except what 
happened next.

IF 




They were locking the doors be- 
hind me„ lining up and blocking 
them even as they did so. Every- 
one. The visitors to the building, 
the elevator starters — even the man 
behind the cigar counter. Run- 
ning, pressing forward, coming to- 
ward me with the cold light of hat- 
red in their eyes. 

I had been discovered — they 
must have detected my detector; 
they knew who I was. They were 
attacking first. 



Vlll 

I T WAS a nightmare come alive. 

At some time in our lives we are 
all touched by incipient paranoia 
and feel that everyone is against us. 
Now I was faced with the reality. 
For a single instant this basic fear 
possessed me — then 1 shrugged it 
off and tried to win. 

But that slight hesitation had 
been enough. What 1 should have 
done was shoot, kill, fire, destroy, 
just as I had planned. But I had not 
planned to face all these people in 
this manner; therefore 1 could not 
win. Of course 1 did damage — 
gas, bombs, a bit of violence — 
but it wasn’t enough. More and 
more hands tore at my clothing and 
there was no end to them. Nor were 
they gentle about it, coming at me 
with the same raw hatred 1 felt for 
them — opposite sides of the coin, 
both seeing destruction in the oth- 
er. 1 was pursued and run down and 



unconsciousness was almost a 
blessing when it dropped. 

Not that I was allowed this 
peace for long. Pain and a sharp 
smell burning in my nostrils drew 
me back to face unpleasant reali- 
ty. A man, a large, tall man, stand- 
ing and facing me, his features 
blurred in my unfocused eyes. 
Many hands seemed to hold me, 
squeezing and shaking me. Some- 
thing moist was pulled across my 
face. It cleared away whatever had 
obscured my vision and I could 
see. See him as he saw me. 

Twice as tall as a normal man, 
so much bigger than 1 that 1 had to 
lean back to look up at him 
towering there. His skin a suffused 
red, his eyes angled and dark, 
many of his teeth pointed when he 
opened his mouth. 

“When are you from?” he asked, 
his voice a harsh drum, speaking 
the language we used in the Corps. 
1 must have reacted to that because 
he smiled with victory, but not with 
warmth. 

“The Special Corps, it had to be. 
The one flare of energy before 
darkness. How many of you came? 
Where are the others?” 

“They — will find you,” I man- 
aged to say. A very minor success 
for my side weighed against the vic- 
tories of the other. As yet they did 
not know that 1 was alone and I 
would stay alive until they dis- 
covered it. Which would not be 
long. 1 had been stripped efficient- 
ly — all my devices had been re-

moved. My defenses were gone, 
lliey would backtrack me to the 
hotel and Hnd out soon enough that 
there was nothing more to fear. 

“Who are you?” I asked, words 
my only weapon. He did not an- 
swer but instead raised both fists in 
a victorious gesture. The words 
came automatically to my lips. 
“You’re mad.” 

“Of course,” he shouted exul- 
tantly and the hands holding me 
pulled and swayed at the same 
time. “That is our condition and 
though they killed us once for it 
they will not kill us again. This 
time we will be victorious because 
we will destroy our enemies even 
before they are born, doom to non- 
life oblivion the ones who did it.” 

I remembered something Coy pu 
had said about this Earth’s being 
destroyed in the. far past. Had it 
been done to stop these people? 
Was it being undone now? His 
screamed words cut off the 
thought. 

“Take him. Torture him most 
profoundly for my pleasure and to 
weaken his will. Then suck all the 
knowledge from his brain. Every- 
thing must be discovered, every 
thing.” 

As the hands tore me from the 
room I knew what I had to do. 
Wait. Get away from this man, 
away from the crowds, to the spe- 
cialized skills of the torturers, to 
some needed privacy. The oppor- 
tunity came as technicians in a 
white laboratory, beat at the people 



who held me and dragged me from 
them. They were as brutal to each 
other as they had been to me, a 
hierarchy of hatred. They must be 
mad, as my captor had said. What 
perversion of human history had 
brought these people upon the 
scene? There was no way to 
imagine. 

Again I waited. Calm in the 
knowledge that I had only a single 
opportunity and that I should not 
throw, it away. The door was 
closed. I was pressed back against 
a table and my ankles secured to it. 
Five men were in the room with 
me. Two had their backs turned, 
attention on their instruments, the 
others were pushing me down. I 
moved my jaw forward and bit 
down as hard as I could upon the 
last tooth. 

T his was my final weapon, the 
ultimate weapon, one that I had 
never used before. Normally I did 
not even carry it, considering the 
normal life-and-death dustups not 
worth this price of winning. The 
present situation was different. 
When I bit, the artificial tooth 
cracked and the drops of bitter 
liquid it contained ran down my 
throat. 

As the pain hit it was oblitera- 
ted, engulfed even as it began by 
the nerve-deadening drug that en- 
abled me to withstand the on- 
slaught of the other ingredients. 
They were a devil’s brew that the 
Corps’ medics had worked out at

IF 




my suggestion, .that had only 
tested before in smaller quantiti^ 
on test animals. Here were all the 
stimulants ever discovered, includ- 
ing the new class of synergators, 
the complex chemicals that en- 
abled the human body to perform 
the incredible feats of hysterical 
strength that had been long known 
but impossible to duplicate. 

Time speeded up and the men 
hovering above me moved slowly. 
Seeing this I waited those fractions 
of a second more for the drugs to 
take complete effect before reach- 
ing out my hands. Though each of 
the heavyset men had his full 
weight on one of my arms it did not 
matter. There was no feeling of 
weight or even effort as I lifted 
them each clear off the floor at the 
same time and drove their skulls 
together before hurling them bodi- 
ly at the third man at the foot of 
the table. All of them impacted, 
rolled, fell, their faces twisted in 
strange contortions of pain and 
fear. I sat up and seized the solid 
metal bands that bound my ankles 
and tore them loose. It appeared to 
be the easiest and most obvious 
thing to do. The act seemed to 
cause some damage to my fingers 
but I was aware of it only as a 
passing annoyance and of no real 
importance. The two remaining 
men in the room were still turning 
-toward mje as though the destruc- 
tion of the other three had only 
taken a few moments. Which it 
surely had. Seeing them still un- 



prepared, one with a weapon half 
raised, I threw myself at them, 
sparing a fist or a clutching hand 
for each, striking them down and 
hurling them toward the others into 
the writhing bundle of twisting 
bodies. They were five to my one 
and I could afford to show them 
not even the slightest mercy, even 
had I cared to. I struck with my 
feet now, since my hands were not 
so good, until there was no more 
motion in the heap. Only then 
could I permit the cold thoughts of 
logic to penetrate the hot berserker 
rage. 

Next? Escape. My clothes were 
rags and I tore them from me in 
strips. My torturers were dressed in 
white garments and I took the time 
to open all , the unfamiliar 
fastenings and dress myself in the 
least soiled of their clothing.' There 
was a ragged wound in my fore- 
head — I covered it with a neat 
dressing, then put wrappings about 
my hands. I was not interrupted 
and when I was ready I left the 
room and went hurriedly back 
down the hallway, retracing the 
course over which I had been so 
recently dragged. There was a buzz 
like a disturbed hive in the building 
and everyone I passed seemed too 
preoccupied to notice me — band- 
ages were a common sight — even 
the people milling about in the an- 
teroom where my weapons had 
been spread out on a large table to 
be examined. If it had been a time 
for smiting I would have smiled. 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT SAVES THE WORLD 41 




G ently, without disturbing 
anyone, I reached over and 
actuated a rack of gas bombs, 
holding my breath as I groped for 
4he nose filters. It is a fast gas and. 
even those who had seen what I had 
done had no time for warnings be- 
fore they fell. The air was hazy 
with the concentration of the gas 
when I picked up a gausspistol and 
threw open the great door to the 
next room. 

^*Your he called out, his mas- 
sive red body standing even as the 
gas felled the others around him. 
He swayed and reached for me — 
fighting the gas that should have 
dropped him instantly — until I 
slammed the pistol into the side of 
his head. Yet his eyes, murderous 
with hatred, were on inS continu- 
ously as I bound him in the chair. 
Only when the door was sealed be- 
hind me did I take the time to look 
him in the face again and see that 
he was still conscious. 

“What kind of man are you?” 
The words came to my lips unbid- 
den. “Who are you?” 

“I am He who will rule forever, 
the mind that never dies.” 

There was such a power in his 
words that I felt myself drawn 
closer, swaying despite myself, the 
roundness of his eyes growing be- 
fore me. I was hazy, the effects of 
my own drugs wearing off perhaps. 
I shook my head and blinked rap- 
idly. But another part of me was 
still alert, still unimpressed by 
great power, great evil. 



“A long rule, but not a comfor- 
table one.” I smiled. “Unless you 
do something about that bad case 
of sunburn.” 

It could not have been better 
spoken. This monster was utterly 
humorless and must have been used 
to nothing except slavish obedi- 
ence. Just once he howled,, a; 
speechless animal souhd, and then 
there was speech enough, a torrent 
of babbled insanity that washed 
around me as I made preparations 
to end the time war. 

Mad? Of course he was, but with 
some kind of organized madness 
that perpetuated and grew and 
infected those around him. The 
body was artificial. I could see the 
scars and grafts now, aiid he spoke 
to me about it. A fabricated body, 
a transplanted, stolen body, a met- 
al-framed monstrosity that told me 
all too much about the manner of 
mind that would choose to live in a 
casing like this. 

There were others like him — but 
he was the best, he was alone — it 
was hard to make sense of every- 
thing but I remembered what I 
could for future reference. And all 
the time I was taking off the ven- 
tilating grill and dusting my pow- 
ders into the air system and mak- 
ing preparations to throw a large- 
sized monkey wrench into this 
Satanic mill. 

He and his followers had been 
destroyed once in the fullness of 
time. He had told me that. In some 
unknown manner they had planned 



42 



IF 




a second chance at the mastery of 
the universe — but they were not to 
have it. I, Slippery Jim diGriz, 
single-minded freebooter of no 
fixed address, had been called up- 
on for many big tasks before and I 
had always delivered. Now I was 
asked to save the world and if I 
must I must. 

“They could not have picked a 
better man/' I said proudly as I 
Rooked in at the great workings of a 
time laboratory neatly peppered 
with sprawled bodies. The great 
green coiled spring of a time-helix 
glowed at me and I smiled back. 

“Bombs in the works and you 
for a ride," I called out happily as I 
made just those preparations. 
“Wipe out the machinery and leave 
the nuts here for the local author- 
ities, though perhaps Big Red de- 
serves a special treatment." 

He certainly did — ^^and I won- 
dered what I was waiting for. I was 
waiting to do it in the heat of pas- 
sion I imagine; no cold killer I, 
even of the coldest of killers. 
Though I would have to be this 
time. I steeled myself to this real- 
ization, thumbed the selector on 
the gausspistol to explosive charges 
and turned to the other room. 

Opportunity presented itself far 
more quickly than I had imagined. 
A great red form was on top of me, 
striking out, hitting me. I rolled 
with the blow, across the room to 
the wall, twisting and bringing up 
the gun. 

He was moving fast, tripping a 



switch and hurling himself at the 
end of the time-helix. 

Bullets move fast, too, and mine 
hissed out of the gausspistol and 
into his body, exploding there. 

And then he was gone. Pulled in- 
to time, forward or backward I did 
not know because the machinery 
was glowing and melting even as I 
ran. Would he be dead when he 
arrived at his destination? He had 
to be. Those were explosive 
charges. 



T hese thoughts occupy me as 
my health improves. Here in 
the private hospital they still won- 
der what made the wounds on my 
body. Money numbs their interest 
a good deal. I sleep well now and 
the great scarlet form of He no 
longer occupies my dreams. Is 
madness catching? Some kinds 
must be; I had it there for an in- 
stant and in the midst of parallel 
time there must be a world dom- 
inated by it. 

But there are better possible 
worlds. One where the Corps rules 
quietly with neat justice, where 
Angelina is. waiting for me. She 
will be there. My most prized pos- 
session is a black box with a man's 
mind inside. The mind of Professor 
Coypu, the master of time. 

If he built his time-helix once he 
should be able to build it again. 

When I am feeling very fit I am 
going to invite him into my brain 
and ask him to try. •

D ACOIT Street was deserted, 
the shops shuttered ,and dark. 
The yells of the demonstrators 
gathered before the entrance to 
the Grand Castle Complex of 
Lumbaga, three blocks to the east, 
where only a dull surf-roar here. 
Scattered brickbats and broken 
spears attested to the political ac- 
tivities of the day, but only a few 
candy wrappers and old news- 
papers blowing across the oily 
cobbles lent movement to the 
scene. 

Retief made his way unmolested 
along the narrow, crooked way; 
five minutes’ brisk walk brought 
him to a rough-hewn door under a 
swinging signboard, adorHbd with 
a lumpy purplish free-form 
pierced by a pointed length of 
wood. .Yellow light leaked from a 
small leaded-glass window be- 
side the door . - 

Retief took up his post under the 
spreading branches of a music 
tree. A gust stirred the leaves, 
evoking a rippling arpeggio of 
crystalline sound that mingled 
mournfully with the fluting of the 
night wind. 

A small wild creature resem- 
bling a disembodied blue eyeball 
with tiny bird feet hopped along a 
twig overhead, goggling at the 
Terran with an appearance of 
intentness heightened by the ab- 
sence of an eyelid. A second free- 
lance ocular appeared, peeping 



from anto^it. i^as^, needle-shaped 
leaves; Nearer at hand, another 
variety of the local fauna — this 
one a convoluted, three-inch ellip- 
soid bearing a remarkable re- 
semblance to an oversized 
ear — perched in a froomUe bush, 
pivoting slowly from left to right 
and back again as if tuning in on a 
faint sound in the distance. 

“You boys ought to get together 
with a nose and form a corpo- 
ration,” Retief murmured. 
“You’d be a dynamite vaudeville 
act.” ' 

Both eyeballs whipped out of 
sight; the ear jerked and began to 
crawl hastily down the stem. A 
faint footfall sounded from the 
direction of a nearby alley 
-mouth. Retief faded back against 
the bole of the ancient tree and 
eased his 2mm gun into his hand. A 
furtive five-foot figure wrapped in 
an ankle-length djellaba emerged 
from the alley. 

“Ignarp,” Retief called softly. 
The newcomer jumped and 
emitted a sharp yelp. 

‘‘Galloping gastropods!” he 
hissed. “You nearly scared me out 
of my epidermis.” He advanced 
another step to peer closely at 
Retief from three, large, watery 
eyes not unlike those concealed in 
the foliage above. “Are you the 
Terry I’m supposed to meet? 
Frankly, all you foreigners look 
alike to me.” 

“An accusation I can’t level 
against you, Ignarp,” Retief said.

IF 




“Didn’t you have, four eyes and a 
purple hide the last time I- saw 
you?” 

“Yeah — I stopped by my place 
for a shower and change.” Ignarp 
gave his rattling sigh. “I didn’t 
know it was going to be such a 
rough evening. What are you do- 
ing out in the. streets? The rallying 
cry of the mob is ‘Get Terry .’ ” 

“It do« seem the incidence of 
violence is escalating since the 
peace talks have been underway. 
Ai^ idea why?*’ 

“We got a few ideas — but may- 
be it’s not time to spill ’em.” 

“Don’t stall, Ignarp. Condi- 
tions have changed since this after- 
noon. My colleague, Mr. Mag- 
nan, has Imn kidnaped.” 

“Wait a minute! You don’t think 
I—” 

“Nothing like that. I just hoped 
you might be able to tell me who 
the likeliest suspect is — for a fee, 
of course.” 

“Well— that sounds like a gra- 
cious offer. But let’s get out of 
sight. I’ve got the feeling un- 
friendly eyes are upon us. Come 
on, the Stake and Kidney’s a 'dis- 
creet bistro, if not too clean. All the 
regulars will be out rioting, so 
we’ll have a modicum of privacy.” 

T he local rapped a complicated 
tattoo on the heavy door, shift- 
ing from one of his six large feet to 
another and casting worried 
glances along the avenue until the 
door rattled and swung inward 



with a lugubrious creak. An un- 
dersized cranium adorned with an 
odd assortment of sensory or- 
gans poked out at belt level to look 
the callers up and down. 

“For Creep’s sake, Fudsot, let 
us in before the City Guard sees 
us,” Ignarp hissed. “This Terry’s 
got diplomatic immunity, but 
those dupes of the power structure 
would like nothing better, than to 
rearrange my internal integ- 
uments along what they consider 
more conventional lines.” 
Grumbling, the landlord ushered 
them down three crooked steps into 
a long, low-ceilinged room smell- 
ing of fried zintx-patties and sour 
wine. He locked the door behiiri 
them and indicated a five-legged 
taUe in the comer. 

“Top conspicuous,” Ignarp de- 
murred. “How about the back 
room?” 

“That’ll run you an extra five 
xots.” 

“Five xots? You’re as bad as the 
entrenched exploiters.” 

“Except they’d charge you 
ten— and then report you. Pay up 
or get out, you and your offworld 
chum. It’s all the same to me.” 
“Okay — okay. The Goodies 
Redistribution Action Bunch 
will get around to you, you tool 
the establishment!” Ignarp ex- 
tracted a small-mouthed purse 
from his voluminous robes and 
handed over a triangular coin of 
green plastic. Fudsot subjected 
it to close examination under

what seemed to be an olfactory 
organ before using a six-inch key 
to unlock the small door at the 
back. 

“It’s all yours, gents,” he 
grunted. “For the next half-hour 
anyway. After that it’ll cost you 
another five xots.’’ 

“Bring us wine,” Ignarp or- 
dered as he dusted off a three- 
legged stool. 

“Sure. Four xots for a quarter- 
zub o’ the house brew. Six xots for 
bottled-in-bond. And I can give 
you a special deal on some aged 
Pepsi; I happened to get hold of a 
small consignment through a spe- 
cial contact down south. Five xots 
the flask, uncut.” 

“Smuggler,” Ignarp snapped. 
“Profiteer! Robber! We-’ll take 
the Pepsi^in sealed bottles, mind 
you!” 

“Sure — whatta you think I am, 
one o’ these chiselers?” 



I GNARP waited in glowering si- 
lence until the landlord had de- 
livered the refreshments and with- 
drawn. 

“That’s what we’re up against,” 
he said gloomily. “You’d think 
Fudsot would be a loyal sup- 
porter of the movement — but 
no — he’s out for the fast xot.” 
“What’s this movement all 
about?” Retief asked. 

“I should think it was obvious,” 
Ignarp said sharply. “Even a for- 
eigner can see that the entire 



planet’s in the grip of an elite corps 
of self-serving reactionaries.” 
“Curious,” Retief said, puffing 
a Chanel dope stick alight. “I had 
the impre^ion that anarchy was 
complete. In fact, that’s why we 
Terries are here — ” 

“I know all about your so-called 
Peace Commission, Retief. You 
Terries and those main-chance 
Groaci are all spinning your 
wheels. Sure, we fight a lot — we 
have ever since the dawn of re- 
corded history, six years ago. 
And even before, if the old tribal 
legyids mean anything. And 
that’s jake — except lately it has 
taken a nasty turn. The old system 
of you break my back. I’ll break 
yours, is falling apart.” 

“Uh-huh.” Retief sampled his 
drink. “And where does your 
Bunch come into the picture?” 
“We’ve formed a third force to 
combat the special privilege 
groups. Of course, we’re just get- 
ting started — only thirteen mem- 
bers at present — but we won’t stop 
until the gross inequities of the 
system have been corrected.” 

“You intend to divide up the 
wealth, an equal share for every- 
one?” 

“You think we’re out of our 
brainpans? We’ll keep the loot for 
ourselves, naturally!” 

“That’s your idea of an equita- 
ble arrangement?” Retief in- 
quired mildly. 

“Of course not.” Ignarp looked 
puzzled. “It’s just simple, old-

IF 




fashioned greed, the noblest of 
emotions.” 

“Sounds like a highly realistic 
program,” Retief said. ‘‘And 
what about the rest of the popula- 
tion?” 

“We’re planning on selling them 
into slavery, naturally. And 
say — maybe you Terries would 
like a slice of the action—” 

“What makes you think so?” 

“Well — aside from the fact that 
the mob is oi(t to get both of. 
us — I’ve heard you get your jollies 
out of taking things away from the 
original owners and handing 
them over to new management. I 
could never figure out why, but we 
members of GRAB are perfectly 
willing to get in on the redistribu- 
tion.” 

“That’s a fair assessment of our 
foreign aid policy, Ignarp. But 
sometimes it’s a little difficult to 
determine who the deserving 
parties are.” 

“Simple enough: Possession is 
prima facie evidence of moral lep- 
rosy; have-nots are pure in heart by 
definition.”" 

“But if we hand the planet over 
to you fellows, then you’ll be the 
haves — ” 

“That’s different,” Ignarp stated 
crisply. “Now, when can we ex- 
pect the first consignment of 
guns, tanks, bombers, somis 
poisoned bodkins and the rest?” 

“Well, there may be a few 
administrative delays, Ignarp. 
Even a bureaucrat as dedicated to 



the spread of enlightenment as 
Ambassador Pouncetrifle may 
have some difficulty picturing a 
baker’s dozen of malcontents as 
the authentic inheritors of the 
mantle of planetary dictatorship.” 
“I had an idea you might try to 
stall,” Ignarp said accusingly. 
“Fortunately we have a telling 
ideological point in reserve.” He 
leaned toward Retief confiden- 
tially. “The situation,” he stated 
solemnly, “has a very nasty — are 
you ready? — racial angle.” 

“Tell me about it.” 



don’t sound very ex- 

--X cited,” Ignarp said in tones 
reflecting disappointment. “I 
heard all a fellow had to do was 
mention the word and you Terries 
automatically started writing 
checks.” 

“A mild exaggeration. In apy 
event, the syndrome hardly applies 
to Lumbaga. You fellows don’t 
have any races.” 

“Hey, what kind of a crack is 
that?” 

“I’ve noticed,” Retief said, “that 
the eyeballs and lower lips hop- 
ping around in the underbrush 
don’t look much different from 
the ones you and your fellow citi- 
zens employ in your daily activi- 
ties — ” 

“Now, hold it right there, 
Retief! I don’t like the turn the 
conversation’s taking — ” 

“In fact,” Retief went on unper- 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET 



49 




turbed, “It seems that the hi^r 
forms of Lumbagan life are all 
evolved from the lower forms 1^ 
combination — ” 

“Don’t come preaching your 
Godless evolutionary doctrines 
around here,’’ Ignarp snapped. 

“Don’t worry, I’m just making 
it up as I go along,” Retief said 
soothii^y. “If my theory is cor- 
rect, you, for example, represent 
the end product of a whole series 
of combinations — ” 

“Let’s not get personal, Terry.” 
“Just g^ing a few facts straight, 
Ignarp, no offense intended. Tell 
me, how old are you?” 

“That’s none of your blasted 
business, Retief.” , 

“I thought you wanted Terran 
backing in your scheme to take 
over the world.” 

“Yeah, that’s nght, but — ” 
“Then it’s niy business.” 

“Well — I don’t know exactly,” 
Igiiarp muttered. “But the best 
theories give a figure around a 
quarter of ajnillion. That’s aver- 
age, of course. After all, by the 
time you go back a couple cen- 
turies, things get kind of vague.” 
The Lumbagan looked em- 
barassed, as attested by the purp- 
lish tinge mounting his wattles. 

“I think I understand,” Retief 
said. “When a Lumbagan has a 
bad heart or a broken arm, he 
trades the injured member in on a 
new One. In time, he’s comirietely 
replaced. Is that it?” 

“That covers most of it,” Ignarp 



said hastOy. “Now, back to prac- 
tical politics—” 

“So in effect, a Lumbagan never 
dies. The question is, how does he 
get started?” 

“Gripes, Retief, is nothing sa- 
cred to you foreigners?” 

“My interest is purely scientific, 
Ignarp.” 

“This racy conversation gets me 
all stirred up,” the local said. 
“However, I guess it’s all for the 
cause. You’ve got it right as it goes, 
but there are a few points you 
missed. Like the fact that the Sin- 
gletons — you know, the free-liv- 
ing eyeballs and pituitary glands 
and the like— can only get to- 
gether in bunches of up to ten. An 
ear might team up with a tentacle 
for mutual security, you know, 
and then later add on an esopha- 
gus — strictly by instinct, natch. 
Not all thew teams work out, of 
course. Evolutionary dead ends, 
you might say. They break up 
again, no hard feelings, and may- 
be later the different parts join 
another accretion. In the end, 
after a few million years, you get 
quite a large mimber of workii^ 
accretions swinging through the 
jungle or creeping around in the 
underbrush, as happy as dams. So 
okay. A tenner Singleton can’t 
add any more free units — but what 
can happen is that two Sin^etOns 
can liidc up to form a Dubb. Got 
it?” 

“I’m trying, Ignarp. Pray con- 
tinue.” 



IF 



50 




“Right. Now, that’s not the end 
of the trail. Two weU<cstabUshed 
Dubbs can get together and make 
up a Trip. Now, a Trip’s a pretty 
complicated life form; with up to 
forty basic units to play around 
with, you can come up with some 
pretty successful combos. But 
Trips are a lot rarer than Dubbs, 
naturally.’’ 

“Naturally. And I suppose two 
congenial Trips can join forces, to 
continue the process?” 

“Right. And when that hap- 
pens, you get a Quad.” Ignarp 
looked at Retief expectantly. 

“And two Qua^ can combine 
to make ^a still more complicated 
creature?” 

“Huh? Where’d you get an ob- 
scene idea like that!” Ignarp 
looked shocked, an effect achieved 
by rotating his eyeballs rapidly. 
“A Four-decker is the ultimate 
product of evolution — a Lum- 
bagan — like me!” 

“I won’t say it’s clear, Ignarp, 
but it’s not quite as opaque as it 
was. But you still haven’t ex- 
plained why you spend so much 
time disassembling each other — 
or just how you decide who’s 
against whom.” 



II 

^t'T’HAT’S where the racial an- 
-I- gle comes in. Now it’s per- 
fectly natural and wholesome 
when everybody is out to get 



everybody else; but. when dis- 
crimination rears its ugly 
head — that’s different. And even 
that wouldn’t bother me,” Ignarp 
added, “Except I happen to be a 
member of the persecuted minor- 
ity.” 

“A minority usually implies at 
least two people with a few char- 
acteristics in common,” Retief 
pointed out. “Since every Liim- 
bagan is unique — ” 

“Except my kind,” Ignarp-said 
gloomily. “Somehow, due to a 
component nobody’s isolated yet, 
we’ve got something nobody else 
has got.” 

“A disabUity?” 

“Heck, no, Retief — they’d for- 
give us that. We’re vastly super- 
ior — that’s what gravels ’em! Just 
a hint of our special skill, and the 
witch-hunt is on.” 

“And just what is this trait that 
gives you the advantage — ” 

“Aha! That’s our Big Secret! 
You see — ” 

A sudden sound of disturbance 
came from in the outer room: a 
dull clatter, a yelp, a thump that 
rattled the cups on the table. 
Something crashed against the 
door hard enough to splinter 
wood. 

“I might have known,” Ignarp 
cried, leaping up. “Sold out by the 
vested interests!’’ 

Retief came to his feet, looking 
around the small, dimly lit room. 
The only visible opening was a 
small ventilator grill. - 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET 



51 




“So long, Reticf— ril be in 
touch — ” 

With a rending crash, the door 
burst inward. The creature that 
bounded through the opening was 
seven feet tall, had yellowish skin 
blotched with black and purple. 
Three gaunt, bristly, kno^kneed 
1^, terminating in broad rub- 
bery webbed feet, made up two 
thirds of its height. Four left and 
two right arms of graduated 
leiigths sprang from the hunched 
shoulders, protected by a cara- 
pace resembling the shell of a 
turtle adorned with twisted spikes. 
Atop a sho^ thick, tendon-corded 
neck rested a pointed head given 
over largdy to a foot-wide, pur- 
ple-lipped mouth crowded with 
needle-like fangs and situated be- 
low a pair of wide-set eyes the size 
of tennis balls. The eyes were a 
Mood-shot yellowish white ex- 
cq>t for the off-centered, metal- 
lic-Mack pupils. A powerful pre- 
hensile tail ending in a three-fin- 
gered hand waved a gnarled steel- 
wood club aloft. 

The monstrosity charged with a 
bellow. Retief spun the table into 
its path, ducked a wild swing as the 
giant crashed into the obstacle 
with a plank-splintering impact. 
At the open door he turned; the 
intruder was threshing its way 
clear of the remains of the boards, 
but of the GRAB member there 
was no sign. Retief had time only 
to notice that the grill was missing 
from the register before the mon- 



ster tossed aside a shattered tim- 
ber and leaped toward him. Re- 
tief stepped out and slammed the 
door, dropping the heavy bar in 
place as the armored alien crashed 
against it. 

I N THE gloom of the outer room 
the squat flgure of the landlord 
was dimly visible, scrambling for 
cover. Retief reached him in two 
strides, caught the back of his 
coarse-weave tunic, lifted him to 
tiptoes. 

“A slight double-cross, eh, 
Fudsot? Who paid you?” he 
inquired genially, as the door be- 
hind him resounded to the ber- 
serker’s blows. 

“Let me go, Terry,” the land- 
lord screeched, “or I’ll see to it 
you’re broken down into surgical 
spares — ” 

“What was the idea? Were you 
out to get me? Or was it Ignarp you 
were after — or both?” . 

“You know so much — you tell 
me,” Fudsot grunt^. 

“But Ignarp fooled you,” Retief 
said. ”He separated into sub- 
assemblies of a convenient size 
and left by the ventilator, right?” 
“You Terries aren’t supposed to 
know about that,” Fudsot mut- 
tered, “A lousy fate, even' for a 
trouble-maker like Ignarp.” 

“So that’s the last of Ignarp, 
eh?” 

“As Ignarp, yeah. His sweet- 
breads and tonsils are back where 
they started ages ago— free-living

IF 




Free1)ies looking around for a 
partner to start up a new tenner.” 
Fudsot wagged his head mourn- 
fully. 

”A sad end for a social reformer 
of his zeal,” Retief said. “Still, 
there’s much to be said for the 
carefree life of an adenoid. I’ll be 
on my way now, Fudsot — but be- 
fore I go, just what was that that 
broke up our drinking party? I’ve 
gotten accustomed to a certain 
pleasing variety in the local citi- 
zenry, but that chap was in an en- 
tirely new category.” 

“I heard rumors, but — ” Fudsot 
broke off. 

“But what?” 

“But it would be bad for my 
health to spread ’em. How’s about 
getting him outa my back room 
now, Terry? I got to set the place to 
rights for the pre-dawn dust-up 
crowd.” 

“No, thanks — I can’t use him.” 

“You mean — you’re leaving 
that monstrosity on my hands?” 

“Certainly. Mind if I use the back 
entrance?” 

“No! That’s where — 1 mean, 
there isn’t one,” the landlord fin- 
ished sullenly. 

“That’s where they’re waiting to 
make the pickup, eh? Thanks for 
the tip.” 

R etief pushed through a 
greasy door behind the bar, 
crossed a kitchen reeking of stale 
fat, slipped out into a narrow 
alleyway decorated with negr 



lected garbage containeis. A soft 
rustling came from a dense patch 
of shadow. A small, spindle-l^- 
ged figure swathed in a dark doak 
step^ forth. From the folds of the 
garment a gloved grasping mem- 
ber protruded, gripping a small 
power gun. 

“So — success attends my efforts. 
The moose has taken the bait and 
sprung the trap — ” 

“Mouse, I think you mean, 
Wilth,” Retief corrected. “What 
brings you out in the damp night 
air?” 

“Drat,” the Groaci hissed. 
“Who informed you of my 
identity?” 

“Don’t you remember? The 
Ambassador introduced us last 
week, at the Mother-in-Laws* Day 
reception.” 

“I refer to the treacher who be- 
trayed my disguise — ” 

“Oh, he’s the same feUow who’s 
standing behind you now with a 
crater gun aimed at your dorsal 
suture.” 

Wilth started violently, causing 
one of his government-issue eye- 
shields to clatter to the cobbles. 
“Undone!” he keened, as Retief 
stepped forward to relieve him of 
his weapon. “Unhappy Wilth! I 
rue the day the mound burst to ex- 
pose me to the harsh external 
world!” 

“By the way, what did you have 
in mind doing with this?” Retief 
inquired, aiming the gun negli- 
gently at its former owner.

“My instructions— I assure you, 
my dear Retief, nothing personal 
was intended — were to intimidate 
you with the firearm, thereby 
causing you to accompany me to 
a designated place for an un- 
inhibited interview with a Most 
Highly Placed Person.” 

**Most highly placed in the 
Groaci hierarchy, I assume.” 

“But of course. Do you imagine 
I’m in the habit of trepanning — if 
that’s the word — fellow diplo- 
mats — even Soft Ones — for the 
convenience of members of 
lesser races?” 

“I shouldn’t have asked. And 
what was to be the subject of this 
conference? Brain surgery?” 

“Do you furthur imagine I am 
privy to the machinations of 
MHPPs?” Wilth glanced ner- 
vously behind him. “As a courtesy 
to a colleague, would you kindly 
instruct your toady to point his 
piece elsewhere—” his faint voice 
faded. “Where is the creature?” 
“He couldn’t make it,” Retief 
said. “Liquor inventory, you 
know — but the intention was 
there. Now — ” 

“Hoaxed!’’ Wilth whistled. 
“Hoodwinked by vile Terran 
duplicity!” 

“Don’t take it so hard, Wilth. 
No harm done; it’s always a 
rewarding experience to make the 
acquaintance of an MHPP of 
whatever persuasion. I’ll go with 
you.” 

“Y ou’ll— ah — accompany me 



to the rendezvous as planned?” 
Wilth goggled all five eye stalks at 
Retief. 

“Why not? The evening is still 
young.” Retief snapped open the 
butt of the power gun, removed the 
energy cell, handed the weapon 
back to the Groaci. 

“Why, this is quite decent of 
you, Retief,’’ Wilth whispered 
breathlessly. “What a pity all 
Groaci-Terran relations can’t be 
conducted in the same spirit of 
amity.” 

“They are, Wilth, they are,” Re- 
tief said soothingly. “Shall we go? 
I wouldn’t like to keep the MHPP 
waiting.” 

I T WAS a brisk ten-minute walk 
through tortuously winding 
streets — hardly more than tunnels 
threading through the monu- 
mental jumble of Lumbagan 
architecture. Wilth halted at a 
. small but massive door set in a 
deeply recessed niche, pounded 
stealthily on the dark panels. 
Weak grayish light leaked out as 
the door opened. A Groaci in the 
uniform of a Peace-keeper peered 
out. 

“Inside, Soft One,’’ Wilth 
ordered curtly. Retief preceded 
his putative captor along a 
cramped passage papered in a pat- 
tern of puce and mustard lozenges 
to a highly varnished bile-green 
door that reflected the watery 
glow of the ceiling dimstrip. The 
guard rapped, thrust the-door wide

and motioned Relief throug^. 

A Groaci in jeweled ey^bields 
was seated behind a wide desk. He 
waved a negligent three-fingered 
hand at Relief, indicating a stool. 

“Any difficulties?" he inquired 
of his underling in Terran. 

“Your Excellency would be 
amazed at how easy it was," WQth 
replied glumly. “I was even aston- 
ished myself." 

“To not accept the legends of 
Terry invincibility,” the senior 
alien snapped, switching to the 
Groacian tongue, “lest you pre- 
dispose yourself to quail in the 
breech!" He turned three eyes on 
Retief while holding the glare of 
the other two on Wilth. “I," he an- 
nounced then, “am Hivemaster 
Shlush. You, I believe, are the fel- 
low Retief?" 

Retief acknowledged his identity 
with a nod and seated himself. 

“You,” Shlush continued 
ominously, “are not unknown to 
me by repute." 

“I’m flattered.” 

“Don’t be.” Shlush hissed. 
“Your name. Soft One, is a by- 
word for the Terran duplicity and 
meddling that have plagued 
Groaci foreign policy since the 
first intimations of our manifest 
Galactic destiny." 

“That’s a rather uncharitable de- 
scription of Corps policy. Hive- 
master," Retief commented. “By 
the way, what brings you here? I 
don’t recall seeing your name on 
the last Foreign Office list." 



“Not to pry into matters of no 
concern to ^iens," Shlush hissed. 

“In fact,” Retief went on, “I 
seem to recall that you were rather 
suddenly retired to civilian life 
after that flasco on Grabnark 
Four — ’’ 

Shlush jabbed a digit at Retief, 
all five eyes canted alertly in his 
guest’s direction now. “Your role 
in the humbling of the great is not 
forgotten, Retief, but now the era 
of Terry domination comes to an 
end. No more will we Groaci suf- 
fer graciously the intolerable 
interposition of foreigners be- 
tween ourselves and the objects of 
our desires.” 

“In the meantime,” _Jtetief 
suggested mildly, “I take it you’d 
like to have a little talk.” 

“Indeed yes,” Shlush whispered. 
“How perceptive of you, Retief.” 

“Not at all,” the Terran de- 
clared. “Wilth told me.” 

“To have babbled of state 
secrets, litter-mate of di'ones?” the 
Hivemaster hiss^ at his under- 
ling. 

“Who, I, Excellency? Why, to 
have but hinted he’d b^t be on his 
metacarpals — ’’ 

“To commit another indiscre- 
tion and to find yourself trussed by 
the polices alongside the Soft 
One!” Shlush turned back to Re- 
tief. “But I’m slighting my hostly 
obligations," he said smoothly. 
“Would you care for a little 
something while we chat?" 

“Brandy, thanks," Retief said.

“You.” Shlush addressed the 
guard still hovering by the door. 
“To fetch brandy at once. Black 
Bacchus will do.” 

“To congratulate your Excel- 
lency on your Excellency’s taste,” 
the Peace-keeper hissed unctious- 
ly. “But to wonder if your Excel- 
lency would amplify your Excel- 
lency’s instructions to include 
data as to where I’m s;upposed to 
fetch it from.” 

“The usual source, hive-fellow 
of defectives!” 

“To do as commanded. Exalted 
One — but don’t, you ink-thay the 
erry-tay ight-may recognize the 
abel-lay?” 

“To assume you have it-way 
enough to oar-pay it in the itchen- 
Jcay!”^Shlush favored "Retief with 
the Groaci equivalent of a sour 
smile. “I’ve instructed the fellow 
to serve our refreshments in a VIP 
decanter reserved for important 
guests,” he translated. 

“I’m sensible of the honor,” 
Retief said. “Now, what was it you 
wanted to tell me?” / 

“Tell you? My dear Tei^, you 
fail to grasp the full implications 
of the situation. It is you who are 
going to tell me!” 

“What would you like to know 
first?” Retief said promptly. 



44*^^ OU may begin with full de- 
X tails of secret Terran arma- 
ment schemes, overall invasion 
strategy, D-day tactical plans and 



close-support logistical arrange- 
ments.” 

“I can cover that in a very few 
words,” Relief said. “There aren’t 
any.” 

“Pah! You expect me to believe 
that an organization of the 
sophistication of the CDT intends 
to play it by ear?” 

“Play what by ear?” Retief 
inquired interestedly. 

“The take-over. What else?” 
“The take-over?” Retiet' tipped 
an inch of cigar ash onto Shlush’s 
polished desk top. “What of?” 

“Of this plague-spot known as 
Lumbaga, naturally.” 

“Who’s taking it over?” Retief 
inquired interestedly. 

“We are — that is to say, you are. 
I mean to say, of course, having 
gotten wind of the perfidious 
schemes laid by you treacherous 
Soft Ones under the cynical guise 
of pretended participation in 
bogus peace talks, we Groaci have 
naturally been compelled to take 
appropriate steps to safeguard 
the endangered lives, property 
and sacred self-determination of 
the indigenous autochthones.” 
“Remarkable,” Retief said. 
“And I suppose that to properly 
protect the Lumbagans, it will b^ 
necessary for Groac temporarily 
to garrison a few troops here. And 
perhaps take over a certain num- 
ber of islands for official use. And 
possibly to requisition a modest 
percentage of the planetary pro- 
duction and manpower for the

fight against foreign exploita- 
tion. And a reasonable tax levy to 
support a portion of the expense 
of this selfless action is to be ex- 
pected.” 

. “I see you have a grasp of the 
realities of interplanetary do- 
goodism,” Shlush acknowledged. 
“Now, as beings-of-the-world, 
why not just give me a brief run- 
down on your own development 
plans? Don’t bother going into de- 
tail; I have specialists on my staff 
who’ll assist you later in dredging 
up the odd unremembered trifle 
from the depths of the sub- 
conscious. For now. Just limit your 
expoMtion to the high points.” 
.“Vou’re too shrewd for me, 
Hivemaster,” Retief conceded. 
“Did you think up this scheme 
yourself” 

“Ah-ah,” Shlush chided his 
prisoner. “No prying, Retief. 
Not that it matters, of course, in- 
asmuch as you’ll soon be occupy- 
ing a shallow excavation under 
the dungeon floor — but it’s bad 
form tipping one’s opponents off 
to the details of one’s operations, 
particularly as I have no time to 
waste. Now — ” 

“On a tight schedule, eh? Tell 
me, Hivemaster, is Ambassador 
Jith in on the plan?” 

“Jith is a dependable civil ser- 
vant of considerable seniority,” 
Shlush said smoothly. “It was 
deemed unwise to burden him 
with excessive detail regarding 
operations outside the sphere of 



his immediate concerns.” 

“Just who is your boss in this 
operation, Shlush?” 

“Ah-ah — mustn’t pry, Retief,” 
the Groaci wagged an admoni- 
tory digit at the Terran. “Suflice 
it to say he’s a most unusual chap, 
a virtual Super-Groaci of most 
uncompromising kidney, not 
the sort, as he himself declares, to 
stand idly by while Groac is 
cheated of her Lumbagan patri- 
mony. You’ll meet him soon 
enough.” 

“Let me see,’' Retief mused 
aloud. “As I recall, it was a Terry 
tramp captain who first put Lum- 
baga on the star maps. He stayed 
long enough to peddle- a few gross 
of glass beads and take on a cargo 
of salted glimp eggs. Oddly 
enough, his report made no men- 
tion of the natives’ warlike ten- 
dencies.” 

“Doubtless he fortuitously hap- 
pened along between massacres,” 
Shlush said tersely. “But — ” 

“The next time Lumbaga 
cropped up in an offlcial dispatch, 
ten years later, was on the occa- 
sion of a run-in between a Terry 
survey crew and a Groaci gun- 
boat. It appears your people were 
well ^tablished here by then.” 
“Yes, yes — and naturally 
enough, they took appropriate ac- 
tion to discourage unauthorized 
tourism. Now — ”

way to gQ about it. I’m afraid,” 
Retief said philosophically. 
“Our sociological teams couldn’t 
pass up a challenge like that. They 
came swarming in — with suitable 
escorts of Peace Enforcers, of 
course — ^to ferret out the unhappy 
incidents in the collective Groaci 
childhood that were responsible 
for your aggressions and — ” 

“I well recall the incident — an 
unexampled instance of Groaci 
restraint in the face of Terran 
provocation.” 

“ — and found a planetwide riot 
in progress,” Retief continued. 
“They also turned up the fact that 
your boys 'were running a rather 
dubious traffic in hearts, lungs, 
and a few other negotiable com- 
modities — ” — • 

“Specimens destined for Groaci 
zoos,” Shlush snapped. “Our 
Groacian interest in exotic wild- 
life is well known.” 

“ — which raised certain ques- 
tions among the coarse-minded. 
There was even a theory afoot that 
you were disassembling the na- 
tives, shipping them out as Free- 
bies and putting them back to- 
gether for use in the sand mines.” 
“A baseless allegation. Besides, 
the practice was at once discon- 
tinue out of deference to the prej- 
udices of the unenlightened.” 

“A far-sighted move, in view of 
the number of guns lined up on 
you at the time. The Inter- 
planetary Tribunal for the Cur- 
tailment of Hostilities moved in 



then, and the war for peace has 
raged ever since.” 

“I am not in need of a toenail 
sketch of recent Furthuronian his- 
tory,” Shlush hissed. “The mani- 
fold iniquities of the CDT are well 
known to me—” The excited 
Hivemaster broke off as the door 
opened abruptly. 

“To forgive this intrusion. 
Exalted One,” the underling who 
had gone to fetch brandy hissed. 
“But—” 

“To better have an explanation 
of surpassing eloquence,” Shlush 
screeched, “or to dangle inverted 
from a torture frame ere tiffin- 
time!” 

“The best. Excellency,” the 
unfortunate fellow whispered, 
advancing into the room, closely 
followed by a hulking Lumbagan 
with a single eye, three legs, an im- 
mense grin, and a large, primitive 
needle gun in his fist. 

“To shoot him down!” Shlush 
hissed in his native tongue to 
Wilth, who stood frozen against the 
wall. 

“To — to— have apparently for- 
gotten to load my pieces” the latter 
whispered and let the impotent 
weapon fall with a clatter. 

“Which one of you aliens is the 
head Groaci around here?” the 
newcomer demanded. 

Wilth’s eye-stalks tilted toward 
his chief. The latter scrooched 
back in his chair, eyeing the aimed 
pistol. “Ah — why do you ask?” he 
inquired cautiously.

“On account of there’s a Big 
Shot that wants to see him,’’ the 
Lumbagan stated, studying the 
four foreigners in turn. “Better 
hurry. I don’t know what assorted 
innards are bringing in the open 
market, but it will be less if th^’re 
full of steel splinters.’’ 

“Merely — ah — a social call, I 
assume?’’ Shlush said hopefully. 

“Assume anything you like — on- 
ly snap into it. The Big Boy don’t 
like to be kept waiting.’’ The caller 
glanced at the timepiece strapped 
to his lower left wrist. “Besides, I 
change sides in half an hour and I 
don’t like unfinished business 
hanging around.’’ 

“Well, I suppose one must ob- 
serve the amenities,’’ Shlush said 
with a certain lack of conviction, 
rising slowly. 

“It’s all right, Shlush,’’ Rctief 
spoke up. “It’s noble of you to 
cover for me, but we can’t fool this 
fellow. I’ll go quietly.’’ 

“Ha?' Trying to pull a fast one?’’ 
The Lumbagan pointed the gun at 
the Hivemaster’s head and squint- 
ed his lone eye along the barrel. 
“I’ve got a good mind to plug you 
for that. But to heck with it. I got 
to make my own loads for this 
popper, so why waste one?” He 
motioned with the bulky weapon at 
Retief. “Let’s go, big boy.” He 
paused. “Hey, you aliens all look 
alike to me, but it seems like you 
got a little different look to you, 
somehow.” He studied Retief, 
comparing him with Wilth and 



the guard with quick side-glances. 

“Two legs,” he muttered; “One 
torso, one head — ah! Got it! They 
got five eyes each, and you only got 
two, kind of sunk-in ones. How 
come?” 

“Birth defect,” Retief said. 

“Oh, excuse mo all to heck, pal. 
No offense. Okay, pick ’em up. We 
got a brisk walk ahead and the 
streets are full of footpads.” 

Ill 

T WO of Lumbaga’s small pink 
moons were in the sky when 
Retief and his captor, after 
traversing a passage hollowed in 
the thick walls of the pile housing 
secret Groaci Headquarters, 
emerged into the street. 

“This seems to be iny night for 
meeting the local civic leaders,” 
Retief commented as they turned 
west, toward the waterfront. 
“Whom are you taking me to?” 

“A high-pay customer on Groo- 
groo island,” his guide said 
shortly, swiveling his asymmetri- 
cal head from side to side so as to 
bring his siqgle eye to bear first on 
one side of the route ahead, then 
the other. “If anybody jumps us, 
it’s every guy for hisself,” he noti- 
fied the Terrao. 

“You expecting to be attacked?” 
Retief inquired easily. 

The alien nodded. “Naturally,” 
he said glumly. “Why should to- 
night be any different from any 
other time?”

“I understand street battles are 
the Lumbagan national pastime,” 
Retief commented. “You sound a 
little unenthusiastic.” 

“Oh, a little rumble now and 
then, a friendly fight in a bar, a 
neighborly clash in the alley, sure. 
Tm as normal as the next guy. But 
the pace is getting me down. 
Frankly, Mr. — what was that 
handle again?” 

“Retief.” 

“I’m Gloot. Like I was saying, 
Retief — between you and me. I’d 
as lief take a break — a long 
break — from the fray. I got enough 
lumps to last me, you know? And 
there’s plenty others feel the 
same.” 

“Then why do you go on squab- 
bling?” — 

“That’s kind of hard to explain 
to a foreigner. I’m just sashaying 
along, minding my own business, 
and all of a sudden— zop! The old 
flghting frenzy hits me — you know 
what I mean?” 

“I’m striving to grasp it,” Re- 
tief said. 

A ten-minute walk brought 
them to the water front. An odor 
of ripe seafood dnd rotting wood 
rose from a lateen-rigged junk 
wallowing as if half sunk at its sag- 
ging wharf. A bulky Lumbagan 
with the usual fandom placement 
of facial features stepped out of 
the shadows to bar Gloot’s way as 
he boarded. 

“Hi, Snult,” the latter called in 
guarded tones. “This here is Re- 



tief. You can put him on my tab.” 

“Yeah?” Snult replied without 
detectable enthusiasm. He 
barked a command over his shoul- 
der. Two lafge locals with excep- 
tional tricep development step- 
ped forward. 

“Dump this spy in the drink,” 
Snult grunted, pointing to Retief. 
“And then hang Gloot to the yard- 
arm for half an hour for reporting 
in late.” He turned his back and 
sauntered off. The two Lumba- 
gans advanced, reaching for Re- 
tief in a businesslike way. He 
leaned aside, caught the proffered 
arm of the nearer and gave it a half 
twist, causing its owner to spin 
around and bow from the waist, at 
which point an accurately placed 
foot propelled the unfortunate 
chap off the pier. The second en- 
forcer lunged, met a chop to the 
neck, followed by a set of stif- 
fened fingers to the midriff. As he 
doubled over, Retief turned him 
gently by the elblow and assisted 
him over the side; where his sjplash 
mingled with that of his partner. 

Ten feet away, Snult paused. 

“Quick work,” he said over his 
shoulder. “But — two splashes?” 

Gloot stepped to his departing 
chief, seized him by the back of 
the neck and unceremoniously 
pitched him into the water. 

“Three,” he corrected and thrust 
a large, six-fingered hand at Re- 
tief. “The cruise is off to a good 
start. We’ve been needing a 
change -of administration around

here. Come on, let’s hoist anchor 
before a platoon of cops comes 
pelting down the dock to rescue 
you.” 

He swaggered down the gang- 
plank, bawling orders. 



T here were few questions 
from the crew, who quickly 
adjusted to the change in manage* 
'ment, assisted by a number of 
sharp blows from a belaying pin 
wielded by the new captain. In a 
matter of minutes the anciept ves- 
sel had cast off ^td was threading 
her way out across the garbage- 
strewn waters of the bay. 

“A shipment of /oo/bark,” 
Gloot advised his guest, pointing 
out a passing barge as they re- 
laxed on . the high poopdeck at the 
stern, quaffing large mugs of 
native ale and admiring the view 
of the moonlit jungle isle past 
which they were sailing. “It comes 
from Delerion, another few is- 
lands to the west. "Potent stuff, 
too. A pinch of foof'va your hook- 
ah and you’re cruising at fifty 
thousand feet without oxygen.” 
“Dope traffic, eh? Is that legal?” 
“No law on the high seas,’’ 
Gloot said. “And damn little on 
land. I guess you’d call the foof 
trade semi-legit. They pay 
taxes — if the free-lance Custonis 
boys are sharp enough to collect 
’em. And they place a few bribes 
here and there.” ^ 

“You seem to know a lot about 



the opposition’s movements,’’ 
Retief commented. 

“I ought to — I heard all about it 
last week when I was a yho^guth- 
erer.” 

“I didn’t know you Lumbagans 
changed islands as well as affili- 
ations.” 

“I was a prisoner of war down 
there. I managed to escape during 
the changing of the guard. By the 
way, keep a few sharp eyes out for 
a low-slung boat with a big car- 
bon-arc light on deck. Interis- 
land Police. Th^’re supposed to 
be up at the other end of the line 
now, but you never can tell.” 

“I can see you’ve done your 
homework, Gloot.” 

“Sure. I got the schedules down 
pat last time I was on the force.” 

“Don’t these rapid changes of al- 
legiance become confusing?’’ 
Retief inquired. “I’d think you’d 
run the risk of accidentally 
shooting yourself under the ini- 
pression you were on the oppo- 
site side.” 

“I guess you can get used to any- 
thing,” Gloot said philosophically. 

“There’s Groo-groo coming up 
on the starboard bow,’’ Retief 
said. “Isn’t it about time to start 
tacking in?” 

Gloot yawned. “Later, maybe,” 
he said. “I decided maybe it’s too 
much trouble trying to ransom 
you. I prefer life on the briny deep 
to floundering arouiid in the 
creepers — ” He was interrupted 
by a shout from the masthead;

jumping up, he aimed a spyglass 
toward a dimly seen shape i^idii^ 
closer across the dark water. 

“Oh-oh — get set. That looks 
like — yep, it’s the patrol. Hey, 
Blump!” Gloot sprain to the com- 
panionway. ’’Hard aport. And 
keep it quiet.’’ 

A S THE unwieldy craft came 
k sluggishly about, a dazzling, 
yard-wide shaft of smoky blue light 
laced across the water, etching the 
privateer’s crew a chalky white 
against the velvet black of shad- 
ows. 

“Heave to, you bilge-scum,’’ an 
amplified voice bellowed from 
the direction of the light, “before 
I put a solid shot into your water- 
line!’’ ■ 

“We’re in trouble,’’ Gloot rap- 
ped. “That’s old Funge on the bull- 
horn; I’d know his voice any-

tains around when he’s working 
the other side of the street.’’ 

“Do we strike, Cap’n?’’ a crew- 
man called from amidships. 

“Remind me to keel-haul you 
when this is over!’’ Gloot roared. 
“Strike, nothing. Swing our stern- 
chaser around and ruA it out over 
the port rail.’’ He charged across 
the deck, which canted sharply as 
the sailors dragged the small can- 
non into position. ’’Load with 
canister — double-charge. Get a 
flrepot up here. Hold her steady 
on a course of one-eight-oh and 
stand by to come about fast.’’ He 



tum^ to Retkf who was stand- 
ing nearby, observing the prep- 
arations for action. “Better get 
below, mister,” he snapped. 
“This is no place for noncomba- 
tants!” 

■’’If you don’t mind. I’ll stick 
around on deck. And if I may 
make a suggestion — it might be a 
good idea to steer for shore.” 

“For shore? You must be hys- 
terical with panic. Everybody 
knows Groo-groo’s swarming with 
carnivores that are all stomach 
and teeth, with jiist enough legs to 
let ’em leap on their prey from 
forty feet away.” 

“In that case, I hope you’re a 
strong swimmer.” 

“Don’t worry, Retief, those rev- 
enue agents are lousy shots — ” 
Gloot’s reassurances were inter- 
rupted by a flash, a boom and the 
whistling passage of a projectile 
that sailed high overhead to raise a 
column of water a hundred yards 
to starboard. 

“I sec what you mean,” Retief 
said. ’’Nevertheless, 1 think 
you’re about to lose your com- 
mand.” He pointed with his cigar 
at the water sluicing across the 
buckled planks of the deck. “We’re 
sinking.” 

Cries rose from the crew, who 
suddenly found themselves ankle 
deep in water. Gloot groaned. 

“I guess I took that last corner 
too fast — she’s opened her 
seams — ” 

A breaker rolled across the deck.

A crewman, swq>t off his feet, 
went under with a despairii^ cry. 
As the vessd wallowed the wa> 
ters surged, rubied back across the 
half-submerged plankii^, swirl- 
ing around Retiefs shins. The 
crewman was no longer in evi- 
dence; instead, a swarm of disas- 
sociated parts splashed in the 
brine, as the Lumbagan’s for- 
merly independent components 
resumed their free-swimming 
status, making instinctiydy for 
shore. 

“Wdl, so long, Retief,” Gloot 
cried. “Maybe our various limbs 
and organs will meet up again in 
some future arrangement — “ he 
broke off. “Ah — sorry. I forgot ~ 
your hookup is a one-time d^. 
Tough lines, Retief. Take a last 
look around. Here we go — ” 

“Let’s swim for it — ^it’s not fw.” 
“Well, I gue% you could do that 
if you want to prolong the process. 
As for me. I’d as soon get it over 
with—’’ 

“And miss finding out if the su- 
perstitions are true? Come on, 
Gloot, last one ashore’s an ampu- 
tated!^.’’ 

R etief dived over the side. He 
.stroked hard against the suc- 
tion created the sinking hulk, 
surfaced in time to see the tip of 
the mast descend slowly from 
sight amid vigorously boiling 
water strewn with flotsam. Mul- ' 
titudes of Singldpns, which had 
formerly constituted the priva- 



teer’s comfdement, churned , the 
waves, helping instinctively for 
shore. A ragged cheer went up 
from the revenue cutter. 

Gloot bobbed up a few yards 
away. “She was my first com- 
mand,’’ he said sadly. “I guess 
maybe she was put tpgether a lit- 
tle too much like us Lumbagans.’’ 

“A mdanchdly moment,’’ Re- 
tief acknowledged. He shrugged 
out of his jacket, pulled off his 
shoes and thrust them into his side 
pockets and set off at an easy 
crawl, Gloot dog-paddling- beside 
him. The evening was cool, but the 
water was . pleasantly warm, 
mildly saline. Groo-groo con- 
gealed from the darkness ahead, 
resolving itself into a cluster of 
rhubarb-shaped trees above a pale 
streak that widened into a curvi^ 
beadi. They rode the breakers in, 
grounding a coarsb coral sand, 
waded through tidal pools to shbre. 

Dark jungle loomed ahead, im- 
penetrable in the dim light of the 
moons. Retief scanned the beach, 
noted a small keg half buried in the 
pink sand, the word RUM sten^ 
cOedontheend. 

“At least we won’t want for 
basic supplies,’’ he commented as 
he extricated the container. 
“You’re about to sample Teriy 
booze, Gloot.’’ 

“Not bad,’’ the local coinment- 
ed five minutes later, after the 
puncheon had been broached with 
a lump of coral and the contents 
sampled. “It bums, but my stom-

adi kind of lik^ it, In fact — ” he 
paused to hiccup. “I like it all 
over. Actually, I just suddenly 
realized life is just a bowl of bloop- 
berries, now that my vision has 
improved — ” 

“I see you’re one of those affec- 
tionate drunks,” Retief said as 
Gloot flung an arm about his 
shoulders. “Better'take it easy, 
Gloot. You may need all your fac- 
ulties intact for the evening 
ahead.” 

Gloot grabbed inaccurately at a 
small free-flying gland. 

‘‘Kootchie-koo — ain’t it cute, 
Retief?” he asked as it landed on 
his head. 

“A most appealing organ,” Re- 
tief agreed. ‘‘But I think you’d bet- 
ter lower your, voice. ’L . 

‘‘What for? Somebody snooz- 
ing?” Gloot stood, weaving slight- 
ly, ‘‘Tell the little guys with the 
hammers to go away,” he mum- 
bled, groping at his scalp; there 
was a sudden flutter as the visitor 
departed hurriedly. Gloot sat 
down hard on the sand. 

‘‘Tell ’em to turn off the sireens 
and the bright lights,” he moaned, 
‘‘and take the stewed gym shoes 
out of my mouth — ” 

‘‘Congratulations, Gloot,” Re- 
tief said. ‘‘I think you broke the 
Galactic speed record for hang- 
overs.” 

‘‘Wha? Oh, it’s you, Retief. 
Lucky you happened along. I just 
been set upon by a strong-arm 
mob and worked over with lead 



pipes. Which way’d they go?” 
‘‘You were too much for them,'” 
Retief reassured his companion. 
“They fled in various directions.” 
“Yah, the yellow-bellies,” Gloot 
muttered. “Oh, my skull.” 

“Where on the island does this 
Big Shot hang out?” Retief asked. 

“Beats me. I was to of been met 
on the beach.” 

“Let’s take a look around,” Re- 
tief suggested, studying the loom- 
ing woods above them. “You check 
that way — ” he _point ed to the 
south— ’’and I’ll look up here.” 
Gloot grunted assent and moved 
off*. Retief followed the curve of 
the shore for a distance of a hun- 
dred yards before the. beach nar- 
rowed and was pinched out by a 
rocky ridge extending down from 
the forest-clad slope above. There 
were no tracks, no empty beer bot- 
tles, no signs of animate life. He 
returned to the starting point. 
Gloot was nowhere in sight. He 
followed the Lumbagan’s boot- 
prints as they wove unsteadily 
across the sand, then turned to- 
ward the nearest tongue of forest. 
The trail ended directly under a 
stout branch extending from the 
mass of foliage. Above, barely 
visible among the obscuring 
leaves, was the freshly cut end of a 
coarsely woven rope.

R etief studied the ground. 
Other footprints were visible

here, but Gloot’s were not among 
them. The marks leading away 
from the spot he noted, were deep- 
ly impressed in the sand, as if the 
owners had been burdened by a 
heavy weight — presumably that of 
the Lumbagan. 

Retief started off along the 
clearly marked spoor leading into 
the deep woods. The darkness here 
was almost total. Creatures of the 
night creaked, chirred and wailed 
in the treetops. An intermittent 
wind made groaning sounds 
among the boughs. Nearer at hand, 
something creaked faintly. Re- 
tief halted, faded back against the 
knobby-barked bole of a giant 
tree. 

A minute passed in silence. Just 
ahead of him a small figure 
emerged cautiously from the un- 
derbrush — a curiously truncated 
Lumbagan, advancing in a 
stealthy crouch. Gripping a stout 
club in a cluster of fists, the native 
sneaked along, crouched, peering 
under bushes and behind trees as 
he came. Retief silently circled 
the sheltering trunk, stepped out 
behind the stranger and cleared 
his throat. With a thin yell the na- 
tive sprang straight into the air. 
He struck the ground running, but 
with a quick grab Retief snared 
him by the garland of teeth cir- 
cling his neck. 

“I’m looking for a friend of 
mine,” Retief said in the native 
tpngue. “I don’t suppose you’ve 
seen him,” 



“Him monster like you?” the 
terrified captive squeaked, hook- 
ing a finger under his necklace to 
ease the strain. 

“Another type of monster en- 
tirely,” Retief said; he gave a suc- 
cinct description of his traveling 
companion. 

“Negative, Sahib. Tribe belong 
me not nab monster fitting that 
description. By the way, how 
about letting go ceremonial col- 
lar before I suffer embarass- 
ment of bite own head off.” 

“You’d be more comfortable if 
you’d stop tugging,” Retief 
pointed out. 

“Against instinct not try get 
away from monster,” the native 
explained. 

“Curious. A moment ago I had 
The distinct impression you were 
trying to get closer to me.” 

“Iron maiden on other foot now. 
You eat now — or save for snack?” 
“I’ll wait, thqnks. Is your vil- 
lage near here?” 

“Usually don’t stop to chat with 
stranger,” the captive muttered, 
“but in this case looks like best bet 
to increase longevity. Monster 
right, I citizen of modest town 
half mile up trail.” 

“I’d like to pay it a visit. How 
about acting as guide?” 

“I got choice in matter?” 
“Certainly,” Retief said. “You 
can either lead me there or take the 
consequences.” 

“Most likely lead monster there 
and take consequences. Chief not

like stranger poking around.” 

”In that case you can introduce 
me. Retiefs the name. What’s 
yours?” 

‘‘Zoof— but probably change to 
Mud, once chief get eyeful of hu- 
miliating circumstances attend- 
ing surprise visit.” 

“Actually, Zoof, it’s not abso- 
lutely necessary that I lead you 
there by the neck if you’ll promise 
not to run out on me.” 

“Got funny feeling monster run 
faster than me anyway. Okay, it’s 
deal. I lead you to village; when 
you get there, you look over menu, 
maybe pick choicer specimen.” 

“It’s a promise.” Retief said. 
“Nice teeth, ” he added as he dis- 
engaged his hand from the neck- 
lace. “Loc^ product?’*" 

“Nope, fancy imported, guar- 
anteed solid plastic.” Zoof 
started through the dense woods, 
Retief close behind. “No catch- 
urn real tooth these days. Life in 
woods going to hell in handcart. 
Monsters ruin hunting; lucky 
chief make deal with Five-eyes for 
steady supply grits and gravy.” 
‘‘The Five-eyes you refer to 
wouldn’t by any chance be 
Groaci?” 

“Could be. Skinny-leg city 
slicker, same big like me, all time 
whisper, like offer deal on hot 
canoe.” 

“That’s Ambassador Jith to the 
life. But I wasn’t aware his 
interests extended this far back 
into the brush.” 



“Sure, small monster go every- 
where, do everything. All time ride 
giant bird, make stink, noise, pile 
Up stone, while big moi^ter tram- 
ple underbrush, rig net, hunt, 
eat—” 

“What do these big monsters 
look like?” Retief inquired. 

“Take look in mirror sometime, 
see for self.” 

“They’re Terrans — like me?” 

Zoof twisted his head to study 
Retief. “Nope, not exact same, 
maybe. Not so much eyes. Some 
got more. Some two time so big 
like you, tear head off, eat one 
bite — ” 

“Have you seen the monsters 
yourself?” 

“You bet; see you, see Five-eyes, 
hear plenty rumor HU in gaps in 
information.” 

“Are there any Groaci at your 
village now?” 

“We find out,” Zoof said. 
“Home town just ahead.” He led 
the way another fifty feet and halt- 
ed. 

“Well, what monster think of 
place?” 



R etief studied the gloomy 
forest around him, insofar as 
he could see it was in no way 
different from the previous half 
mile of woods. 

“It’s unspoiled — I’ll say that for 
it,” he commented. “Is this Main 
Street?” 

“Monster kidding? Is snazzy

residential section, plenty tight 
zoning, you bet. Come on, we find 
chief and boys over at favorite 
hangout. Old Log.” 

“A bar?” 

“Nope, just swell place root for 
grubs.” 

“I take it the Grubs aren’t a ball 
team?” 

“More like hors d’ouvre,” Zoof 
corrected. He led the way through 
a dense stand of forest patriarchs, 
emerged in a small, open glade 
where half a dozen Lumbagans, 
differing wildly in detail, wan- 
dered apparently aimlessly, gaz- 
ing at the ground. One pounced 
with a sharp cry, came up with a 
wriggling creature, which he thrust 
into a sack at his waist. 

‘‘My grasp of Lumbagan 
zoology is somewhat hazy,” 
Retief said. “How do these grubs 
fit into the general biological pic- 
ture?” 

‘‘Play essential role,” Zoof 
replied. “Grub grow up be kidney, 
jawbone, kneecap, you name it.” 

“So much for future genera- 
tions. Still, it’s no worse than eat- 
ing eggs, I suppose.” 

“Not eat ’em,” Zoof corrected. 
“Collect, sell to skinny-leg mon- 
ster, get plenty Colonel Sanders 
fried chicken and other exotic 
chow, you bet.” 

The grub hunters had interrupted 
their search to stare inhospitably 
at Retief. 

“Hey, Chief,” Zoof greeted his 
leader, “this monster name Re- 



tief, express desire meet jungle 
big shot. Retief, shake grasping 
member of Chief Boobooboo, 
son of Chief Booboo, son of Chief 
Boob.” 

“Grandpa name Boo, not 
Boob,” the chief corr^ted sternly. 
“Why you want me, monster? 
Zoof not look tender?” 

“Actually I was looking for a 
friend—” 

“Hmm, neat switch. Usual 
custom eat enemy, but after all, 
why be prejudice? Eat chum too, 
get varied diet.” Boobooboo 
looked appraisingly at Zoof. 

“As it happens. I’ve already 
eaten,” Retief said. “The friend 
I’m looking for seems to have got- 
ten involved with a rope.” 

“Monster bark up wrong flag- 
pole,” the chief stated. “Un- 
sophisticated aborigine unequal 
to technical challenge of make 
rope.” 

“Any idea who might have 
snared him?” 

“Sure.” 

“Possibly you’d confide in me.” 
“Why?” 

“I don’t suppose the simple de- 
sire to do a good turn would be suf- 
ficient motivation?” 

“Not that unsophisticated,” 
Boobooboo said flatly. “Good 
time remember ancient folk wis- 
dom embodied in old tribal say- 
ing: What’s In It For Me?” 

“What about a firm promise of 
a year’s supply of pizza pies?” 

“Not much nourishment in 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET 



67 




promise,” the chief pointed out. 
“Got better idea — ” Boobooboo 
lowered his voice. “Know where 
big supply eatables located; you 
help collect, maybe I get big- 
hearted and tell all.” 

“I think I’d prefer a more defi- 
nite commitment,” Retief said. 
“Strike out the ‘maybe’ and we 
might be able to get together.” 
“Sure; just stuck ‘maybe’ in so 
have something to concede.” 

“I see I’m dealing with a pro,” 
Retief acknowledged. "En 
passant, where is the food supply 
located?” 

“Half mile that direction.” The 
chief pointed. “Enough chow for 
whole tribe from now to next St. 
Swithin’s Day.” 

“I take it you’ve actually seen 
the groceries for yourself?” 

“Sure, same time deliver.” 

“I see. You plan to hijack the 
supplies you’ve been selling to the 
Groaci.” 

“Hijack loaded word. Just say 
decided to share wealth with 
underprivileged. Monsters got 
wealth — we got urtderprivilege.” 
“At the present rate. Chief, I 
predict your supply of unsophis- 
tication won’t last out the winter. 
But why do you need my help? You 
have enough troops to stage a raid 
on your own.” 

“Monster not get big picture. 
Skinny-legs spoil-sport hide come- 
stibles away inside magic cave, pa- 
trol perimeter with plenty fear- 
some monster, tear simple tribes- 



man apart with two hands while 
hunt fleas with rest.” 

, “And you think I can penetrate 
this fortress?” 

“Maybe not; but better you than 
me and boys; we just simple pas- 
toral types; hunt, fish, steal, not go 
in for heavy work.” 

“On the whole. Chief, the propo- 
sition doesn’t sound overwhelm- 
ingly attractive.” 

“I figure maybe you feel that 
way; so save snapper for end: you 
come here ask about missing bud- 
dy? Monster in luck; get economi- 
cal combination deal. Kidnaped 
pal same place victuals. Get two 
for price of one.” 

“I think,” Retief said, “I’ve been 
outmanuvered.” 



A QUARTER of an hour later, 
Retief, the chief, Zoof and the 
bulk of the truncated tribesmen, 
stood in the shelter of a giant 
mumble tree, the soft mutterings 
of its foliage covering the sound 
of their conversation. 

“Straight ahead, can’t miss it,” 
the chief was saying. “But watch 
snares; you get caught same way 
absent chum, deal off.” 
“Understood, Chief. And you’ll 
keep your people posted in posi- 
tion to create a diversion in the 
event I have to leave the vicinity in 
haste.” 

“Correct. We stand by, catch 
any wandering grub come gal- 
loping past.”

“It’s been a pleasure dealing 
with you. Chief. If you ever decide 
to give up the rural way of life, 
drop me a line. The Corps could 
use your talents instructing a 
course in creative naiVet6.” 

“Thanks, Retief. Keep offer in 
mind in case present caper not pan 
out.” 

The forest was silent as Retief 
made his way along the dimly 
marked trail, but for a stealthy 
rustling in the undergrowth which 
ceased when he halted,, began 
again when he went on. He had 
covered perhaps a hundred and 
fifty yards when he rounded an 
abrupt turn and was face to face 
with twelve feet of tusked night- 
mare. 

For a moment he stood 
unmoving, studying the monstros- 
ity looming ten feet away. Its 
bleary, pinkish eyes, three in num- 
ber, stared unwinkingly at him 
from a lumpy face equipped with 
tufted whiskers placed at ran- 
dom around a vast, loose-lipped 
mouth, and a scattering of gap- 
ing nostrils. Immense arms hung 
almost to the ground from its mas- 
sive shoulders. Three bowed legs 
supported the weight of a power- 
fully muscled torso — the big fel- 
low’s generous pedal extremities 
were housed in gigantic sneakers 
with round black reinforcing 
patches over the ankle-bones. A 
long tail curled up over one clavi- 
cle, ending in a seven-fingered 
hand with which the creature was 



exploring the interior of a large, 
pointed ear. Other hands gripped a 
naked two-edge sword at least nine 
feet in length. 

Retief took a hand-rolled cigar 
from an inside pocket, puffed it 
alight, blew out pale violet smoke. 

“Nice night,” he said. 

The monster drew a deep breath. 
“AHHHrrrghhh!” it bellowed. 

“Sorry,” Retief said, “I didn’t 
quite catch that remark.” 

“AHHHrrrghhh!” the creature 
repeated. 

Retief shook his head. “You’re 
still not getting through.” 

“Ahhrrgh?” 

“You do it well,” Retief said. 
“Exceptionally nice timbre. 
Real feeling.” 

“You really like it?” the giant 
said in a surprisingly high-pitched 
voice. “Gee, thanks a lot.” 

“I don’t know when I’ve seen it 
done better. But is that all there 
is?” . 

“You mean it ain’t enough?” 

“I’m perfectly satisfied,” Retief 
assured his new acquaintance. “I 
just wanted to be sure there wasn’t 
an encore.” 

“I practiced it plenty,” the over- 
sized Lumbagan said. “I wouldn’t 
of wanted to of done it wrong.” 

“Certainly not. By the way, what 
does it mean?” 

“How do I know? Who tells me 
anything? I’m just old Smelch — 
everybody pushes me around on 
account of I’m easygoing, you 
know?”

“I think I met a relative of 
yours in town, Smelch. Unfortu- 
nately I had to rush away before 
we really had a chance to chat.” 
“Yeah? Well, I heard a few of 
the boys was to of been took for a 
glom at the bright lights. But not 
me. No such luck.” 



44’l^OU don’t happen to know 
A who’s been down for a bare- 
foot stroll on the shore do you, 
Smelch?” the Terran inquired 
casually. “A party with three-toed 
feet.” 

“Three? Lessee.” Smelch’s tail- 
mounted hand scratched at his 
mottled scalp with a sound 
reminiscent of a spade striking 
marl. “That’d be mtJre’n one and 
less than nine, right?” 

“You’re narrowing the field,” 
Retief said encouragingly. 

“If I just knew how many nine 
was. I’d be in business,” Smelch 
muttered. “That ain’t nothing 
like say, six, for example?” 

“Close, but no dope-stick. Skip 
that point, Smelch — I didn’t mean 
to get technical: Were you wait- 
ing for anything special when I 
came along?” 

“You bet: my relief.” 

“When’s he due?” 

“Well, lessee: I come out here a 
while back and been here for quite 
a time, so what does that leave? 
Say — half an hour?” 

“More like a jiffy and a half, 
give or take a few shakes of a 



iamb’s tail.- What’s up at the top of 
the trail?” 

“That’s what nobody ain’t sup- 
posed to know.” 

“Why not?” 

“On account of it’s like a secret, 
see?” 

“I’m beginning to get a glim- 
mering. Who says it’s a secret?” 

Smelch’s fingernail abraded his 
chin with a loud sound. 

“That’s supposed to be another 
secret.” Smelch’s features rear- 
ranged themselves in what might 
have been a puzzled frown. “What 
I can’t figure is — if it’s a secret, 
how come you know about it?” 

“Word get around,” Retief said 
reassuringly. “Okay if I go up and 
have a look?” 

“Maybe you ought to identify 
yourself first. Not that I don’t 
trust you, but you know how it is.” 

“Certainly. I’m Retief, Smelch.” 
He shook the hand at the end of 
the tail, which returned the grip 
firmly. 

“Sorry about the routine, Retief, 
but these days a guy can’t be too 
careful.” 

“What about?” 

Smelch blinked all three eyes in 
rotation, a vertiginous effect. 

“I get it,” he said, “that’s what 
you call a joke, right? I’m nuts 
about jokes, only the trouble is 
usually nobody tells me about ’em 
in time to laugh.” 

“It’s a problem that often 
plagues ambassadors, Smelch. 
But don’t worry; I’ll be sure to tip

IF 




you off in advance next time.” 
“Gee, you’re a all-right guy, Re- 
tief, even if you are kind of a runt 
and all, no offense.” 

T he sound of heavy feet came 
from up-trail; a squat, five-foot 
figure lumbered into view, as 
solidly built as Smelch but less 
beautiful, his various arms, legs 
and ears having been arranged 
with a fine disregard of standard 
patterns. One of his five hands 
gripped a fifteen-foot harpoon; 
his four eyes, on six-inch stalks, 
goggled atop a flattened skull 
which gave the appearance of 
having been matured inside a hot 
water bottle. 

“About time, Flunt,” Smelch 
greeted the newcomer. “You’re a 
shake and a half late.” 

“Spare me any carping criti- 
cisms,” Flunt replied in a tone of 
long-suffering weariness. “I’ve just 
come from an interview with that 
bossy little — ” He broke off, look- 
ing Retief up and down. “Well, you 
might at least offer an introduc- 
tion,” he said sharply to Smelch, 
extending a hand to the diplomat. 
“I’m Flunt. Pardon my appear- 
ance — ” he indicated two uncomb- 
ed fringes of purplish-blue fila- 
ments springing from just below 
his cheekbones — “but I just wash- 
ed my hide and I can’t do a thing 
with it.” 

“Not at all,” Retief said am- 
biguously, giving Flunt’s feet a 
quick glance. They were bare and 



remarkably human-looking. “My 
name’s Retief.” 

“Goodness, I hope I’m not inter- 
rupting anything.” 

“Not at all. Smelch and I were 
just passing the time of night. 
Interesting little island, Flunt. 
See many strangers here?” 
“Gracious, I hope not. I’m sup- 
posed to do dreadful things to 
them.” Flunt gave Retief a star- 
tled look. “Are you by any chance 
astranger?” 

“Are you kidding?” Smelch 
spoke up. “He’s Retief, like I told 
you.” 

“Just so you’re sure. Little Sir 
Nasty-nice wouldn’t like it a bit if 
any outsiders sneaked a peek at 
his precious whateveritis. Really, 
for this job one needs eyes in the 
back of one’s head!” 

“Yeah,” Smelch said. “Lucky 
you got ’em.” 

“Flunt, do you know anyone 
with three-toed feet in these parts?” 
Retief asked. 

“Three-toed feet? Hmmm. 
They’re a bit passe this season, of 
course — but I think I’ve seen a few 
around. Why?” His voice lowered 
confidentially. “If you’re inter- 
ested in picking up half a dozen at 
a bargain price, I think I may be 
able to put you onto a good thing.” 
“I might be,” Retief said. 
“When could I meet the owners?” 
“Oh, I don’t think you’d like 
that,” Flunt said soberly. “No, I 
don’t think you’d like that at all, at 
all. And neither would little Mr.

Sticky-fingers, now that I reflect 
on it. Actually, 1 shouldn't have 
mentioned the matter. My 
blunder. Forget I said anything." 

“Gome on, Retief," Smelcltsaid 
loudly. “Me and you’ll just take a 
little ankle up the trail. I’ll point 
out the points of interest and like 
that.’’ He gave the Terran an 
elaborate three-eyed wink. 

“Capital idea, Smelch.’’ 

“Look here, Smelch,’’ Flunt said 
nervously, “you’re not going to 
go sneaking around you-know- 
where and getting you-know-who 
all upset about you-know-what?’’ 

“I do?’’ Smelch looked pleased. 
“Maybe you don’t; it’s been 
dunned into your head hourly all 
your life — but then you’ve only 
been around for a week—’’ Flunt 
turned to Retief. “I hate to sound 
finicky, Retief, but if this ummy- 
day tries to ip-slay you into, well, 
anyplace you shouldn’t ee-bay, 
well — one has one’s job to do,’’ He 
fingered the barbed head of his 
harpoon meaningfully. 

“I can give you a definite tenta- 
tive hypothetical assurance on 
that,’’ Retief said crisply. “But 
don’t hold me to it.’’ 

“Well, in that case — ’’ Retief 
felt Flunt’S eyes on him as he and 
Smelch moved up the trail toward 
whatever lay above. 

V 

F or the first hundred yards, 
nothing untoward disturbed the 



silence of the forest at night — noth- 
ing other than the normal quota of 
chirps, squeaks and scuttlings that 
attested to the activities of the 
abundant wildlife of the region. 
Then, without warning, a gigan- 
tic shape charged from the under- 
brush. Smelch, in the lead, late in 
swinging his broad-headed spear 
around, took the brunt of the 
charge solidly against his chest. 
His explosive grunt was almost 
drowned in the sound of the col- 
lision. The antagonists surged to 
and from, trampling shrubbery, 
shaking trees, grunting like 
beached walruses. Suddenly the 
stranger bent his knees, rammed 
his head into Smelch’s midriff 
and rose, Smelch spread-eagled 
across his shoulders. He pivoted 
sharply and hurled Smelch into 
the undergrowth, snapping off a 
medium-sized tree in the process. 
The victor paused only long 
enough to beat out a rapid tattoo 
on his chest and wait until a brief 
coughing fit passed before whirl- 
ing on Retief. The Terran side- 
stepped the dimly seen monster’s 
first rush, which carried the latter 
well into the thicket beside the 
path. Smelch reappeared from 
the opposite side, shaking his 
head and muttering. The stranger 
came crashing back onto the 
scene only to be met by a two lefts 
and a right haymaker that halted 
him in his tracks. 

“Sorry about that, Retief,” 
Smelch said contritely, as his an-

IF 




tagonist toppled like a felled oak. 
^'But the mug got my dander up. 
He shouldn’t ought to of came out 
leading with his chin anyways.” 

“A neat one-two-three,” Retief 
commented, blowing a plume of 
smoke toward the fallen fighter. 
“Let’s take a closer look.” He 
parted the brush to look down at 
the casualty who lay sprawled on 
his back, out cold. The ten-foot fig- 
ure was remarkably conserva- 
tive for a Lumbagan, he thought: 
only two legs and arms, a single 
narrow head with close-set paired 
eyes, a long no^e and mouth, an 
unimpressive chin. The feet, 
clearly outlined inside rawhide 
buskins, featured five toes each, 
matching the hands’ ten fingers. 

“What’s the matter?” Smelch 
said. “You know him?” 

“No, but he bears a certain re- 
semblance to a colleague of mine.” 
“Geeze, the poor guy. Well, 
beauty ain’t everything. Any- 
ways, here’s your chance to pick up 
a set of dogs at a steal, if you know 
what I mean.” He rammed an el- 
bow toward Retiefs ribs, a com- 
radely gesture capable of col- 
lapsing a lung had it landed. 

“I think I’ll pass up the oppor- 
tunity this time,” Retief said. 



H e stepped forward to in- 
vestigate a strand of barbed 
wire vaguely discernible in the 
gloom. It was one of three, he dis- 
covered, running parallel to the 



trail and firmly attached to stout 
posts. 

“JRetief, we better blow,” 
Smelch said. “Like Flunt said, no- 
body but nobody don’t want to 
poke his noses and stuff in too close 
around you-know-where.” 
“Actually, I don’t think I do,” 
Retief corrected . his massive ac- 
quaintance. “Know where, I 
mean*” 

“Good,” Smelch said in a re- 
lieved tone. “You’re safer that 
way.” 

“Not afraid, are you?” 

“Yeah.” Smelch nodded vigor- 
ously. “I hear they got ways of 
making a guy regret the day his 
left leg met up with his right.” 
“Who says so?” 

“Everybody, Retief! All the boys 
been warned to stay clear, once 
they was outside — ” 

“You mean you’ve been inside?” 
“Sure.” Smelch looked puzzled, 
an expression involving a rapid 
twitching of his ears. “How could 
1 of not been?” 

“Flunt’s been there, too?” 
“Natch. You don’t figure 'the 
moomy-bird brung him, do you? 
That’s a little joke, Retief. I know 
you know the moomy-bird didn’t 
bring him.” 

“How about this fellow?” Re- 
tief indicated the unconscious 
Lumbagan stretched at his feet. 
“He came from inside, too?” 
Smelch clucked sympathetical- 
ly. “I guess they must of left out 
some o’ your marbles, Retief.

Where else would Zung of come 
from? In fact — ” he lowered his 
voice confidentially — “he ain’t 
never graduated, poor sucker.” 
“Maybe you’d care to amplify 
that remark a little, Smelch.” 
“Zung is one of the boys which 
they ain’t been allowed out in the 
big, wonderful world like you and 
me.” Smelch spread several hands 
expansively. “Except only may- 
be a few feet to clobber anybody 
that comes along. What I figure 
is — ” his voice took on a solemn 
note — “him and the other ones, 
they ain’t all there, you know? Re- 
jects, like.” 

“Rejects from what, Smelch?” 
“Shhh.” Smelch looked around 
worriedly. “I don’t like the trend 
of the conversation, -which we’re 
treading on shaky ground, espe- 
cially this close to you-know- 
what.” 

“No, but I think it’s time I found 
out.” 

“He^ — you ain’t planning on 
climbing the fence?” 

“Unless you know where the 
gate is.” 

“Sure — right up the trail about a 
hundred yards or maybe ten. I 
ain’t too precise on fine detail.” 
“Then I’ll be off, Smelch. Give 
my regards to Flunt when you see 
him.” 

“You’re really going to sneak 
back into you-know-where and 
grab a peek at you-know-what? 
Boy oh boy, if you-know-who sees 
you — ” 



“I know. Thanks for clarifying 
matters. By the way, if you should 
run into a fellow with three legs 
who answers to the name of Gloot, 
I’d appreciate any help you could 
give him.” 

“Sure. You let me know if we 
see him.” 

“We?” 

“Heck, yes. You don’t think I’m 
going in there alone, do you? And 
we better get moving. Zung’s 
starting to twitch.” 

A S THEY proceeded silently 
up the path, Retief was again 
aware of the soft rustlings and 
snufflings he had noted on and off 
since his arrival on the island. 
Through a gap in the shrubbery he 
caught a fleeting glimpse of a 
stealthy figure which ducked out 
of sight as he paused. 

The gate — a wide construction 
of aluminum panels and barbed 
wire — blocked the trail a hundred 
feet above the point where they had 
encountered Zung. A green- 
shaded spotlight outlined it stark- 
ly against the black foliage. A 
padlock the size of an alarm clock 
dangled from a massive hasp. 

“Any more guards hidden out 
around the area?” Retief asked. 

“Naw — with Flunt and me do- 
ing a tight security job down below 
and the other bum working in 
close, who needs it?” 

“An incisive point,” Retief con- 
ceded. They walked boldly up to 
the gate. Smelch tried it, seemed 



74 



IF 




surprised when it failed to swing 
open. 

“Looks like it’s stuck,’’ he com- 
mented, and ripped it from its 
hinges, lock and all, tossing the 
crumpled panels aside. Metal 
shrieked and crashed. 

“Nothing like direct action,’’ 
Retief said admiringly. “But from 
this point on I suggest we observe 
a trifle more caution, just in case 
there’s anyone up there whose 
suspicions might be aroused by the 
sound of a three-car collision this 
far from the nearest highway.’’ 
“Say, pretty shrewd,’’ Smelch 
said admiringly. “I always wanted 
to team up with a guy which he 
could figure the angles.” 

The path continued a few yards 
beyond the former gate before de- 
bouching into a wide cleared strip 
adjoining a high board fence that 
extended for some distance in 
each direction. 

“Home sweet home,” Smelch 
said nostalgically. “The old place 
sure has changed since I ventured 
out into the great world.” 

“Has it?” 

“Sure. After all, that was a cou- 
ple hours ago.” 

“This is where you were born 
and raised, in other words.” 

“Yeah — inside the fence is where 
I spent my happy childhood, all 
four days- of it.” 

“I’d like to see the old place.” 
“Well, old Sneakyfeet Won’t like 
it — but to heck with him and his 
dumb rules. Who but a alumnus 



would want to look inside any- 
ways? Come on, Retief.” 

Smelch led the way to an 
inconspicuous gate which yielded 
to his efforts, not without a cer- 
tain amount of splintering. Re- 
tief propped the door back in place 
and turned to regard an extensive 
array of ranked cages stacked in 
long aisles that led away in the 
moonlight to the far line of the 
fence. A dispirited yammering 
chorus of sound started up nearby, 
reminiscent of visiting day at a 
pet hospital. A vaguely zoo-like 
odor hung in the air. 

R etief approached the near- 
est row of cages. In the first, a 
creature resembling a rubber 
rutabega with spidery legs 
slumped dolefully against the 
bars. Adjacent, a pair of appre- 
hensive-looking ankles huddled 
together for warmth. 

“Freebies,” Smelch said. “Just 
in from the jungle. Little do the 
poor little fellers dream what a 
high-class destiny is in store for 
’em.” 

“What destiny is in store for 
them, Smelch?” 

“Right this way,” the Lum- 
bagan invited, indicating the next 
rank of cages. These were some- 
what larger than those in the first 
section, each containing a crea- 
ture giving the appearance of 
having been assembled from 
spare parts. Here a spindly leg 
drummed the fingers of a lone 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET 



75 




hand springing from where a foot 
might have been expected; there a 
bored-looking lower lip, flanked 
by a pair of generous ears, sprang 
directly from an unmistakable el- 
bow. In the next echelon, the cages 
were still larger, occupied by 
specimens of a more sophisti- 
cated appearance. A well-devel- 
oped paunch with a trio of staring 
brown eyes at the top squatted on 
four three-toed feet, watching the 
visitors incuriously. A remark- 
ably human-looking head with a 
full beard swung from the roof of 
its prison by the muscular arm 
that was its sole appendage. 

“Uh, some of the boys look a lit- 
tle weird,” Smelch said apolo- 
getically, “but in the.end they 
mostly turn out handsome devils, 
like me.” 

“Someone seems to have gone to 
considerable trouble to set up this 
lonely-hearts farm,” Retief com- 
mented. “In the natural state, I 
understand matches among 
Freebies take place at rare inter- 
vals. This looks like mass produc- 
tion. Any idea why, Smelch?” 

“Nope. I ain’t one of them guys 
which he asts questions all the 
time, you know what I mean? I 
mean, why poke the old nostrils in 
and maybe get ’em stuffed full of 
lint, right?” 

“It’s a philosophy without which 
bureaucracy as we know it would 
soon wither away,” Retief con- 
ceded. “What was your job when 
you were here, Smelch?” 



“Well, lessee, there was eating. 
That took a lot of my time. Then 
there was sleeping. I liked that 
pretty good. Then — lessee — I guess 
that just about wraps it up. Why?” 
“You must have a strong 
union,” Retief said. “Why were 
you here?” 

“Geeze, you know that’s a ques- 
tion which a guy could wonder 
about it a long time if he wouldn’t 
drop off to sleep first. Personally, 
I got a like theory that before we 
can attack the problem of tran- 
scendentalism, we got to examine 
the nature of knowledge and its 
limitations, making a appro- 
priate distinction between 
noumena and phenomena. I figure 
by coordinating perceptions by 
means of rationally evolved con- 
cepts of understanding we can 
proceed to the analysis of experi- 
ence and arrive at the categorical 
imperative, with its implicit con- 
comitants. Get what I mean?” 

“I think possibly I’ve been un- 
derestimating you, Smelch. I 
didn’t know you read Kant.” 
“Can’t read, you mean,” Smelch 
corrected. “Nope, I never had the 
time for no idle pursuits, what 
with that heavy schedule I told 
you about.” 

“Quite understandable, Smelch. 
By the way, Flunt mentioned 
you’d only been here a week. 
Where were you before that?” 
“Well, now we’re getting into the 
area of the metaphysical, Retief, 
which when you examine ma- 



76 



IF 




teriai phenomena by inductive 
processes you arrive at a 
philosophical materialism, not to 
exclude ontological and epistemo- 
logical considerations, which in gei\- 
eral could be assumed to denj^ 
metaphysics any validity in the con- 
text of Aristotelian logic. Or am 
I just spinning my wheels?” 

“Did you work that out for your- 
self, Smelch, or did somebody tip 
you off?” 

“Huh?” 

“Never mind. I don’t think I’d 
grasp the full significance of the an- 
swer anyway.” 



T hey passed the last of the 
cages, these occupied by a be- 
wildering variety of Lumbagan 
life forms in a wide range of colors 
and shapes and displaying a re- 
markably diverse endowment of 
limbs, sensory e^juipment and 
other somatic elements. 

“They look vigorous enough,” 
Retief commented as one hefty 
specimen gripped the bars and 
drooled at him. “But I get an im- 
pression they’re not too bright.” 
“Well, sure, first they got to go 
through the indoctrination center. 
You can’t expect an agglomera- 
tion which last week it was grub- 
bing roots in the woods to be a in- 
stant intellectual. That takes a 
couple days.” 

“I see. Where do we go from 
here, Smelch?” 

“How about the cafeteria? I got 



a yen for some good old home 
cooking.” 

“Let’s save that until after I’ve 
met You-know-who,” Retief sug- 
gested. 

“Mondays they usually got mud- 
on-a-mortarboard,” Smelch said 
nostalgically, testing the air 
through his multiple nostrils. 
“Also on Wednesday, Saturday, 
and all the other days. Lucky it’s 
my favorite. But I guess you’re 
right, Retief. We got to make our 
courtesy calls before we chow 
down. I guess old Sneakyfeet — ” 
Smelch paused. '"Hey, talking 
about sneaky feet, old You-know- 
who has got three toes on each 
foot; I barged in on him once when 
he was just climbing out of a tub 
of hot sand. Wow, if language was 
skinning hooks. I’d of been flayed 
to the ribs in no time. That’s when 
I seen ’em. His feet, I mean.” 

He broke off as a faint, rhyth- 
mic sound became audible, swiftly 
growing louder. The running 
lights of a copter appeared above 
the treetops, winking in a com- 
plicated pattern. The machine 
sank out of sight beyond the fence. 

“What do you know, Retief— 
that’s old Whatzis himself,” 
Smelch cried delightedly. “But 
now that it’s time to make the in- 
troductions,” he added with sudden 
doubt, “I kind of wonder if it’s a 
good idea. If he’s in a bad mood 
he could maybe interpret it as me 
not doing my job of keeping out- 
siders on the outside.”

“Let’s hope he doesn’t take a 
narrow niinded approach,” Re- 
tief said encouragingly. He had 
reached the section of fence oppo- 
site the point where the copter had 
descended. He jumped, caught the 
top, pulled himself up in time to 
see a hurrying figure in a dark 
cloak and a pale headgear disap- 
pear into a small structure at the 
edge of the clearing. 

He pulled himself over and 
dropped to the ground. A moment 
later Smelch joined him. 

“That copter’s been busy to- 
night,” Retief said. “What’s in the 
building?” 

“All kinds of neat stuff, like the 
cafeteria,” Smelch said. “Did I 
mention they got mud-on-a-mor- 
tarboard?” 

“You did. Let’s go take a closer 
look.” 

They reached the door through 
which the heli’s passenger had 
disappeared. It opened and they 
stepped into a brightly lit corri- 
dor. Light gleamed through a 
glass-paneled door at the far end. 
When they reached it, muffled 
sounds were audible from the 
room beyond. 

VI 

R etief took a small button- 
shaped object from his pock- 
et, pressed it to the door, put his 
ear to it. 

“. you still hesitate?” a suave 
voice said. “Possibly you are de- 



terred by ethical consider- 
ations, a reluctance to betray 
those who have placed their trust in 
you. Dismiss the thought, fellow! 
What harm to honor if nobody 
blabs, eh?” 

Snorting and threshing sounds 
followed. 

“Ah — Exalted One,” a breathy 
Groaci voice whispered, “to offer 
a suggestion: the removal of the 
gag to facilitate compliance 
with instructions.” 

“Um. Thank you, Chish. I was 
just about so to order. Guard!” 

Heavy footsteps sounded, fol- 
lowed by a ripping sound, a hoarse 
yell, a shuddering sigh. 

“Just one,” Gloot’s voice said 
yearningly. “Just one little 
ocular, right by the roots — ” ' 

Retief tried the doorknob, found 
it locked. He quickly extracted a 
small but complicated device 
from an inner pocket, applied it 
to the latch. There was a soft click. 
The door opened silently on a 
small dark room lined with coat 
hooks; beyond was a second 
room, clinically furnished in 
white. Gloot sat in a steel chair 
under a ceiling glare panel. He 
was strapped in position by heavy 
bands of wire mesh. An elaborate 
network of color-coded wires led 
from a cap-like device clamped to 
his head to a gray steel cabinet re- 
sembling a ground-car tune-up 
console. 

A Lumbagan, if anything larger 
and more baroque than Smelch,

leaned against the wall. A uni- 
formed Groaci stood by a door in 
the opposite wall. Before the 
captive stood a slight figure nat- 
tily attired in bile-green Bermuda 
shorts, an aloha shirt in clashing 
pinks and orange and violet Ar- 
gyles. 

“Well, my old friend Nith, for- 
merly of the Groaci Secret Po- 
lice,” Retief said softly to 
Smelch. “I wasn’t aware his duties 
had brought him to these shores.” 
“Now, fellow,” Nith demanded 
of Gloot, “who sent you here?” 
“Nobody sent me; me and a 
chum came together.” 

“Aha! This chum — what power 
does he represent?” 

“He’s a Groaci,” Gloot said. 
“A Groaci?” 

“You heard me. Five-eyes. And 
a big wheel at that.” 

“AmpliHed One,” Chish hissed. 
“To begin to see the light! Lacka- 
day! To have accidentally ab- 
ducted a member of the personal 
staff of a Groacian MHPP!” 

Nith waggled his eyes playfully 
at Gloot. “In your report to your 
superior. I’m sure you won’t find 
it necessary to mention this lit- 
tle contretemps, eh? Just look up- 
on it as a slight misunderstand- 
ing, easUy mended — ” 

“Upthrust One,” Lt. Chish in- 
terrupted, “The possibility that 
though this one’s companion is of 
the noble Groacian stock, he him- 
self might yet be in the pay of in- 
ferior races — ” 



“To be sure, Leftenant,” Nith 
.said smoothly. “To have been 
about to raise precisely that 
issue.” He faced Gloot. “Confess 
all, unfortunate dupe. You were 
the prisoner of the Groacian 
noblebeii^, correct?” 

“Well — technically he was my 
prisoner. But between you and 
me. Five-eyes, I was beginning to 
wonder who was in charge.” 

“You dared impede the free- 
dom of a High-Born One? You ab- 
ducted him here against his will?” 
“Naw, it wasn’t that way,” 
Gloot said. “It was kind of a joint 
venture, like.” 

“Joint venture? I fail to postu- 
late ahy conceivable circum- 
stance under which the interests 
of Groac and of an aboriginal 
would coincide.” 

“Dough,” Gloot said succinct- 
ly. “Mazoola. Bread. You know.” 
“You shared an interest in gour- 
naet cookery?” 

“Cripes, how’d you know that?” 
“Further association with us 
Groaci will accustom you to such 
casual displays of omniscience,” 
Nith said smoothly. 

“But — to have implied that it oc- 
cupied the status of co-equal with 
its Groaci companion,” Chish ob- 
jected. 

“To have spoken allegorically, 
as is customary with artists! To 
have implied only that His Super- 
nalness’s shared interest in mat- 
ters gastronomic. But ndw to 
wonder — what brings Groaci

brass to this dismal backwater, 
unannounced? The possibility 
that Supreme HQ is checking up 
on me. Tell me, fellow,” he ad- 
dressed Gloot, “what was the pur- 
pose of your Groaci master’s visit 
to these remote environs?” 

“To see what was cooking, what 
else?” 

“Yes, yes, of course — a clever 
cover story. But in addition to his 
culinary researches, what was the 
mission of the High-Born?” 

“If he had one he never told 
me,” Gloot said. 

“To be expected that his Gran- 
deur would not confide in an un- 
derling,” Nith murmured. 

“Estimable Broodmaster, sir^’’ 
Chish hissed. “To hypothesize: 
might not these same intruders be 
a veritable inspection team, dis- 
patched by Ambassador Jith, 
who, jealous of his prerogatives, 
may have introduced them here 
by devious means, the better to 
check up on your operation un- 
heralded?” 

“Exactly what I had deduced,” 
Nith whispered and started for the 
door. “Certain reactionary ele- 
ments have long desired my down- 
fall. What better time than now to 
bring long schemes -to naught by 
meddlesome probing, thereafter 
to cry me culpable? Forewarned, 
I’ll see to certain matters re- 
garding the voucher files; mean- 
time, dispatch the prisoner in- 
stantly, lest he level feckless 
charges against my person!” 



N ith skittered through the 
door and was gone. Chish 
made a rude gesture at the closed 
door and turned to Gloot, drawing 
his pistol. 

“No violence, now,” he cau- 
tioned the Lumbagan as he re- 
moved the cranial attachments of 
the veracitometer. “And re- 
member to mention my name in 
glowing terms to yo\ir master. 
That’s Chish: C-H-I-S-H, by a 
gross miscarriage of justice a 
mere Leftenant — ” 

He broke off as Retief stepped 
through the door, Smelch behind 
him. Uttering a faint cry, the of- 
ficer whirled toward the door by 
which his superior had just de- 
parted. The Terran reached it first. 

“Guard! To me!” Chish keened, 
but as the Lumbagan behemoth 
lumbered into action, Smelch 
stepped behind him, gripped 
hands with himself, raised the re- 
sultant picnic-ham-sized aggre- 
gation of bone and muscle over- 
head and brought it down atop the 
fellow’s cranium with a re- 
sounding thump, felling him in his 
tracks. 

“Poor old Vump, he always had 
a glass head,” • Smelch com- 
mented. 

“Nice one!” Gloot yelled. “But 
save old Nith for me!” 

“Unhand me, Terran,” Chish 
whispered, trying unsuccess- 
fully to dodge past Retief, “To 
have important business re- 
quiring my urgent attention — ”

“You’re confused, Leftenant,” 
Relief said. “It was Broodmas- 
ter Nith who had the pressing ap- 
pointment.” 

“Indeed? To have never heard of 
him.” 

“Too bad. I was hoping you 
could tell me whom he works for.” 

“Never, vile Soft One!” 

“I’d avoid these long-term pre- 
dictions if I were you, Chish. They 
have a tendency to unravel at the 
edges.” Relief looked past the 
Groaci to Gloot, busily freeing 
himself from the last of his en- 
tanglements. 

“Don’t break anything, Gloot; 
we wouldn’t want to short the lef- 
tenants wiring.” 

“Where’d the other one go?” 
Gloot demanded. “That’s the one 
I want. I want to pluck those eyes 
one at a time, like picking ripe 
froom-fruit! How about it, you?” 
he glowered at Chish, who re- 
coiled from the menacing figure 
towering over him. “Where’s the 
other Terry?” 

“The — the other Terry?” the 
Groaci hissed in agitation. “What 
other Terry?” 

“You know what other Terry!” 
Gloot roared. 

“Oh, that Terry,” Chish said 
hurriedly. “Why, I do believe 
he’s occupying the, er, guest suite, 
just across the passage.” 

“Yeah?” Gloot looked baffled. 
“What’s he doing there?” 

“He was, ah, assisting me in 
certain experimental activi- 



ties,” Chish replied. “Which re- 
minds me. I’m overdue for my 
saline infusion, so if you’ll kindly 
unhand me — ” 

Gloot pushed the Groaci away 
and went across the room and into 
the passage. He paused before the 
door across the hall and rapped. A 
faint, uncertain cry answered him. 

“Whattaya know?” he said. 
“He’s in there.” He tried the knob, 
then stepped back and kicked the 
stout panel; the plastic cracked. A 
second kick shattered the lock, 
and the door banged inward. A 
slight figure appeared in the open- 
ing, checked at the sight of the 
Lumbagan. 

“Hey,” Gloot said weakly as 
Relief came up behind him. 
“That’s not — ” 

“Well, there you are at last. Re- 
lief,” First Secretary Magnan 
gasped. “Heavens, I thought 
you’d never turn up!’’ 

VII 

<4¥ DON’T get it,” Gloot said, 

. -I- looking from Magnan to Re- 
lief. “Another Groaci with only 
two eyes, just like you. Re- 
lief— and I just noticed that Terry 
you’re holding onto is wearing 
three fakes, just like that other 
Terry, Chish. What gives?” 

“Duplicity on a vast scale,” 
Relief said. “It’s creeping in ev- 
erywhere these days.” 

“You labor under a misappre- 
hension, dull-witted bucolic!” the

Groaci began, subsiding in mid- 
word at a minatory tweak. 

“What’s this person referring 
to?’’ Magnan inquired, favoring 
Gloot with a distasteful look. “Is 
he somehow under the impres- 
sion — ’’ 

“He’s a great admirer of the 
Groaci, Mr. Magnan. Natural- 
ly he leaped to the conclusion that 
you enjoyed that status, since you 
resemble me so closely.’’ Retief 
gave Chisjh’s collar an extra half- 
twist as the latter attempted to 
speak. 

“How come,’’ Gloot asked 
.bluntly, “this Groaci’s got the 
same shortage of eyes as you, Re- 
tief?’’ 

“Quite simple, Gloot. He’s a 
relative; we’re both members of 
the ape family.” 

“Oh. But what’s he doing here, 
palling around with these foreign 
ers?” 

“Simplicity itself,’’ Magnan 
said. “I was seized by a brace of 
brigands and whisked here for 
some obscure purpose unconnect- 
ed with normal diplomatic pro- 
ced ures.” The First Secretary 
looked severely at Chish. “Per- 
' haps you h^e some explanation?” 

“I’m sure he does.” Retief as- 
sisted the struggling Groaci to the 
chair and with Gloot’s enthusi- 
astic aid strapped him in position, 
fitting the cranial attachments 
in place atop his cartilaginous 
skull amid his eye-stalks, which 
drooped dejectedly. 



“Alas for lost opportunities,” 
the officer mourned. “Had I but 
known of the imminen9e of my 
downfall, I might at least have had 
the pleasure of making plain to 
the abominaUe Nith my true as- 
sessment of his worth!” 

“Too bad, Chish. Maybe I’ll 
find a chance to make it up to 
you,” Retief said. “Now, I be- 
lieve this modd has the automatic 
prevarication-suppressor. It will 
shoot a nice jolt through your 
trigeminal nerve if you acciden- 
tally stray into inaccuracy. Just 
set it at max, Gloot, to save time.” 

“Base alien, thus to serve an in- 
nocent official harmlessly en- 
gaged in the performance of his 
duties — ” 

“Later, Chish. Who was the Big 
Shot?” 

“One Swarm-master Ussh, a 
most prestigious official. You’ll 
rue the day — ” 

“Probably. Where’s OiQega Sta- 
tion?” 

“I haven’t the faintest — yip — the 
faintest intention of lying. I was 
about to say — eek! On a desert isle 
some leagues from here, drat all 
Soft Ones!” 

“Which one?” Gloot demanded. 
“Rumboogy? Delerion?” 

“Sprook!” Chish whispered. “I 
could wish you no more dolorous 
fate than to set foot in its miasmic 
swamps!” 

“The needles say he’s telling the 
truth,” Gloot said. 

“As he sees it,” Retief said.

“Unfortunately, false informa- 
tion doesn't register as long as he 
believes it. I have a feeling his 
boss wasn't keeping him fully in- 
formed." 

“It is you, vile counterfeit — " 
Chish started and broke off, 
listening. Faintly from afar a 
clattering sounded. ‘‘Ha!" The 
Groaci hissed in triumph. “In in- 
stants a squad of Peace-keepers 
will be upon you to put an end to 
your presumptuous invasion of 
sacred Groacian symbolic soil, as 
well as to your grotesque impos- 
ture!" 

“What's he talking about?" 
Gloot demanded. 

“I refer to the understandable 
aspirations of lesser races to the 
lofty status of Groacihood — " 

“He also means the cops will be 
here any minute," Retief cut in. “I 
wonder if you’d be kind enough, 
Chish, as to direct us to the near- 
est exit." 

“A door — at the end of the pas- 
sage there. A passage leads thence 
to a hidden egress — and good rid- 
dance to you!" 

“Well, we’ll have to be saying 
good night now, Leftenant. When 
Vump comes to perhaps he’ll un- 
strap you. You can while away the 
time by planning what you should 
have said to Nith when you had the 
chance." 

“True," Chish whispered. “Gone 
are my dreams of early advance- 
ment. But I may yet get a crack at 
that lousy civilian." 



“Let the thought sustain you in 
your hour of trial," Retief said. 



T en minutes later, after care- 
fully skirting the spot where 
Flunt guarded the trail, Retief, 
Magnum and Gloot followed the 
tracks left in the soft moss of the 
trail by the fleeing Groaci, Nith. 
The path, while narrow, was high 
and dry, twisting and turning to 
avoid the boles of giant, moss-hung 
trees rising from the dark water, 
skirting the deeper pools. In a 
small, open patch of spongy 
ground the trail ended abruptly. 
There was no sign of Nith. 

“Well, whattaya know,’’ Gloot 
commented, peering into the sur- 
rounding darkness. “Who would 
of thought the little Terry was that 
fast on his feet? He’s gone and got 
clean away, so I guess we might as 
well get started back — ’’ 

“Listen," Retief said softly. 

A faint cry was repeated some- 
where ahead. He started off at a 
run, picking a route from one 
root-clump to another. A hundred 
feet farther on he emerged into the 
open to witness a curious sight — 
from a sturdy bough overhanging 
the path, Nith dangled by one leg 
in mid-air, supported in an invert- 
ed position by a length of stout 
rope. 

“Good of you to wait, Nith," 
Retief said. “An excellent spot for 
a confidential talk." 

“To cut me down at once and to

enjoy the eternal gratitude of the 
Groacian state, renewable an- 
nually at a modest fee,” the snared 
alien whispered. 

“Stumbled over one of your own 
trip-wires, eh?” Retief said sym- 
pathetically, “It’s one of the haz- 
ards of the diplomatic way of 
life.” 

“What is this talk of diplomatic 
wiles? As it happens, I am a 
simple scientist, here to observe 
the nest-building habits of the 
Lesser Tufted Adam’s Apple — ” 

“Sorry, Nith, an ingenious cov- 
er, but blown. I’m afraid. We met 
a few years back when you were 
number two to General Fiss, the 
time he tried to take over Yale.” 

“Tour Director Fiss and I were 
interested only in the excavation 
of artifacts of the Yalcan cul- 
ture,” Nith protested. 

“You Groaci have pioneered the 
science of instant archeology, 
true,” Retief conceded, ”but 
good form requires that you wait 
until the owners aren’t using the 
bones any longer before you try to 
wire them together in a glass case. 
However, we have more imme- 
diate matters to discuss at the 
moment. Let’s begin with where 
you were headed in such haste,” 

“I find it singularly difficult to 
marshall my recollective facul- 
ties while suspended in this un- 
seemly position,” the Groaci 
hissed. 

“You’d find it even more diffi- 
cult if the point of attachment 



were your third thoracic verte- 
bra,” Retief pointed out. 

“Long will this day live in in- 
famy,” Nith wailed. “Very well, 
Terry, I’ll reveal my destination, 
but only under protest. As it hap- 
pens, 1 maintain a modest retreat 
in the foothills above — to it I re- 
tire on occasion to meditate. Now 
cut me down promptly and in my 
report I’ll do my best to minimize 
the shabby role you played in this 
sorry contretemps.” 

44^^00 late for secrecy now,” 
M. Retief said as Gloot and 
Magnan arrived panting, 
splashed with mud and festooned 
with algae. 

“Well,” the First Secretary said 
as he spied the dangling alien, “at 
least he had the decency to at- 
tempt suicide — though one might 
have known he’d bungle it.” 

”You speak of suicide. Soft 
One?” Nith keened. “Such indeed 
is the fate of those who would in- 
vade the sacrosanct precincts of 
my bucolic hideaway.” 

“Don’t imagine for a moment 
that your threats intimidate me,” 
Magnan replied loftily. “It’s just 
that we happen to be leaving now 
anyway. Come, Retief, suitably 
padded — discussed in adequate 
detail, that is — my report of the 
disasters we’ve encountered up 
to this point will serve adequately 
to impress the Ambassador with 
my zeal.” 

“An inspiring thought, Mr. 



84 



IF 




Magnan. Just picture his expres- 
sion when you tell him you’ve dis- 
covered there may be a plot afoot 
to take over Lumbaga and that 
you hurried back to let him know 
what, without wasting time flnd- 
ing out when, where, why, and 
how.” 

“But as I was about to say,” 
Magnan continued quickly, 
“why dash off just when we’re on 
the verge of achieving a coup of 
such stunning proportions?” 

“Now, just how would one go 
about finding this weekend cot- 
tage of yours,” Retief queried 
Nith. 

“You imagine, presumptuous 
alien, that I would reveal details 
of my personal affairs to such as 
you?” 

“My mistake, Nith.” Retief 
turned to Magnan and Gloot. ”It 
seems we’ll have to find it on our 
own. Shall we go, gentlemen?” 

“What — and leave me here 
suspended, prey to any passing 
appetite, to say nothing of the risk 
of incipient apoplexy?” Nith 
shrilled in protest. 

“Yeah, that would be cruel,” 
Gloot said and drew his knife. “I’ll 
just slit the sucker’s throat — ” 

“I capitulate,” the Groaci 
hissed. “Proceed north-east by 
east to a lone foot tree, take a right, 
proceed another hundred paces 
upslope and you will confront my 
confidential lair. I appeal to your 
better natures to pry then no 
more, but to betake yourselves in 



haste to more congenial sur- 
roundings, there to report favor- 
ably on this concrete evidence of 
the importance of the reflective 
life in the philosophy of the benign 
Groaci.” 

“I don’t get it,” Gloot said. 
“How come this Terry’s all the 
time putting in a plug for you 
Groaci?” 

“Conscience,” Magnan said 
crisply. “I suppose you may as 
well cut him loose now — provided 
he promises not to go scuttling 
ahead and spoil our surprise.” 

“I assure you I will scuttle in an- 
other direction entirely,” Nith 
whispered as Gloot slashed the 
rope, allowing him to drop to the 
ground with a painful impact. He 
sprang up and disappeared along 
the backtrail. 

“I’m not sure that was the best 
move we’ve made all evening,” 
Retief said. “But I suspect we’ll 
know for sure very soon. Mean- 
while, let’s go take a lobk.” 

A DIM light glowed from a 
point high above, shining 
down through the trees dotting the 
steeply rising slope. 

“Well, whattaya know,” Gloot 
said. “I thought the little runt was 
lying, but here’s his meditation 
parlor— just like he said.” 

“Why, the very idea,” Magnan 
whispered. “Ambassador Jith 
never mentioned funding any R 
and R facilities in the hustings.” 
They emerged onto a talus slope. 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET 



85 




From here they were able to make 
out the silhouette of a duster of 
towers rising from the crest of the 
peak. The lighted window went 
dark; a moment later a glow 
sprang up at another. 

“Apparently Nith doesn’t do his 
thinking alone,” Retief said. 

“If the place is full o’ Terries,” 
Gloot said, “what’s supposed to 
Iceep ’em from blasting us into 
Freebies before you can say 
oops?” 

“Nothing much. Accordingly, 
I recommend extreme stealth 
from this point on.” 

Twenty feet higher they encoun- 
tered a night of narrow steps cut 
into the stone. Retief climbed over 
the handrail beaded with mois- 
ture in the damp air and led the 
way upward, Gloot and Magnan 
close behind him. At a landing 
another twenty feet higher the 
steps took a right-angled turn. The 
drop below was vertical now; the 
tops of trees rustled in the faint 
breeze. Far below a cluster of lan- 
terns moved on the shore. Far 
across the water the lights of the 
capital floated on blackness. 

Gloot started to speak, then 
changed his mind. “Never mind,” 
he muttered. “The more I know 
the less I like it. I’m even ber 
ginning, to get a funny feeling it 
was your idea and not mine to grab 
you from Groaci HQ.” 

At the next landing, by leaning 
far out over the rail to look up, Re- 
tief was able to see a row of shut- 



tered windows set in a squat, 
thick-walled structure of a bilious 
ochre color. The building ap- 
peared to consist of several wings, 
set at slightly different levels in 
accommodation to the contours of 
the rugged peak on which it was 
built. 

“Quite a layout — ’’ Gloot 
started and broke off as feet 
clacked above. A spindly figure in 
a flaring helmet and a spined hip 
cloak leaned over the railing of a 
terrace, peering down the barrel 
of a blast-rifle with five alertly 
canted oculars. 

“Hssst! To advance and give the 
password,’’ a thin voice whis- 
pered sibilantly. 

“To contain yourself in patience, 
hive-mate of brood-foulers,” Re- 
tief whispered sharply in Groaci. 
“To have had a brisk trot to report 
the failure of the incompetent 
Nith! To require a moment in 
which to respire!” He motioned 
to Gloot. “You go first,” he whis- 
pered softly. “Pretend to be 
scared.” 

“Pretend?’’ The Lumbagan 
choked. “I’m petrified! But what 
the heck, I don’t aim to show the 
purple glimp-feather. Here goes.” 

“The impropriety of your natter- 
ing — and my curiosity as to whom 
you natter with!’’ the Groaci 
Peace-keeper hissed. 

“The prompt satisfaction of 
your curiosity,’’ Retief whis- 
pered back, motioning Gloot 
past. He followed up the final 



86 



IF 




flight of steps. As the Lumbagan 
reached the sentry's terrace the 
latter hissed and swung the gun to 
cover him. 

“The impropriety of taking 
hasty action/’ Retief said sharp- 
ly. The guard swiveled a pair of 
eyes toward him and uttered a 
faint Groaci yelp of dismay. 

“A Soft One — ” he started, but 
his feeble cry was cut off abruptly 
by a smart rap to the side of the jaw 
delivered by Gloot. Retief deftly 
caught the victim’s helmet as he 
collapsed. 

R etief quickly scouted the 
narrow gallery on which they 
now found themselves. From the 
platform at the end a compli- 
cated system of rods atop a tower 
was visible. 

“Curious,” Magnan whispered. 
“Trideo antennae here? I wasn’t 
aware Lumbaga boasted trans- 
mission facilities.” 

“I have an idea the transmitter 
hasn’t gone into full service yet,” 
Retief said. 

Further discussion was inter- 
rupted by a faint whop-whop- 
whop, which grew swiftly louder. 
A copter swept low over the tree 
tops, made a sliding turn and 
came back to hover for a moment 
before settling gently to the roof 
of the building. The pilot — a 
small, thin-legged individual 
wrapped in a black cloak and wear- 
ing a solar topi — hopped down and 
disappeared into the shadows. 



Light shone a moment later from 
an opened hatch in the roof, into 
which the new arrival descended, 
closing the panel behind him. 

“Give me a leg up, Gloot,” Re- 
tief said. 

“Anything for you, pal,” the 
local said dubiously, grasping his 
own shin firmly. “But are you sure 
you can use it?” 

“On second thought, just a boost 
will do,” Retief amended. Gloot 
offered linked hands as a stirrup; 
Retief went up the wall. The roof 
was deserted but for the silent 
copter squatting inside a yellow- 
painted circle. He leaned back to 
lend a hand to Magnan, then to 
Gloot. Together they crossed to 
the trapdoor. It opened sound- 
lessly. Steep steps led down into 
deep gloom. At the bottom, Re- 
tief used his pocket flash quickly 
to check the room; it was empty 
but for stacked crates and cartons 
bearing stenciled markings. 

“Electronic gear,” Retief said. 
“And surgical supplies.” 

“Here’s one labeled: Acme The- 
atrical Services,” Magnan whis- 
pered. “Curious, I never suspect- 
ed the Groaci had an interest in 
amateur dramatics.” 

“I suspect they may have en- 
tered the field at a professional 
level,” Retief said. 

The storeroom opened into a 
narrow, dimly lit passage. Faint 
murmurings sounded from be- 
hind a door. Retief went to it, put 
his ear against the panel. 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET

. to have come within an ace 
of discovery!” hissed a breathy 
Groaci voice. “To make all haste 
now — ” 

“The inadvisability of rushing 
the cadence!” another voice re- 
plied. “To not louse up the trium- 
phant culmination of my re- 
searches!” 

“Yes, yes, to get on with it. To 
have a tight schedule.” 

A muted humming sound started 
up; a faint odor of ozone filtered 
through the closed door. 

“Sounds like an illegal trans- 
mitter,” Retief said. 

“What’s illegal about a trans- 
mitter?” Gloot demanded. 

“Let’s find out.” Retief turned 
the doorknob silently, eased the 
door open an inch. Two Groaci, 
one in bile-green shorts and orange 
and violet argyles, the other in a 
stained white laboratory smock 
and holding a clipboard, stood 
before a wide panel thickly set 
with dials, switches, oscilloscope 
tubes and blinking indicator 
lights. One side of the room was 
given over to stacked cages in 
which eyeballs, kidneys, aden- 
oids and other forms of Lum- 
bagan wildlife perched dis- 
consolately on twigs or moped 
glumly in corners amid scattered 
straw. 

“ . the completion of pre- 
liminary testing,” the technician 
was whispering, “to be ready now 
to conduct field trials of limited 
range, after which, on to the final 



stage in the fulfillment of selfless 
Groaci objectives with all deliber- 
ate haste!” 

“To spare me the propaganda,” 
the other snapped. “To have read 
the official handouts. To now tell- 
ingly demonstrate the effective- 
ness of the device without further 
procrastination.” 

T he technician turned to the 
control panel, began setting 
dials in a complicated sequence, 
referring frequently to the clip- 
board. 

“Haste, haste,” the other Groaci 
muttered. “To not procrastinate 
in the eye of the metaphorical can- 
non — or is it the mouth of the 
needle?” 

He stepped forward suddenly 
and, before the other could inter- 
cept him, pushed the largest but- 
ton on the panel. 

With a hoarse bellow Gloot 
plunged past Retief, slammed the 
door wide and bounded into the 
room. The two Groaci whirled, ut- 
tered shrill yelps and dived in oppo- 
site directions. The small crea- 
tures in their cages had gone into a 
flurry of activity, Retief noted 
peripherally, hurling themselves 
against the wire mesh as if frantic 
to come to grips with their neigh- 
bors. The momentum of Gloot’s 
charge carried him full tilt against 
the button-studded console. 
Lights flashed; harsh buzzings 
sounded> ending in a crackle of 
arcing electricity. Gloot stag-

IF 




gered back and sat down hard. The 
lab animals subsided as abruptly 
as they had leaped into motion. 
Retief jumped forward in time to 
nab the technician as he dithered, 
unsure which way to run. A door 
slammed at the back of the room. 

“Retief! What in the world—’’ 
Magnan quavered, peering from 
the door. 

“Oh boy,’’ Gloot muttered, 
fingering his head with all three 
hands as he sat weaving in the 
middle of the room. “Oh boy oh 
boy oh boy — ’’ 

“Would you care to amplify that 
remark?’’ Retief asked, holding 
the struggling Groaci. 

“I guess I blew it, huh?’’ the 
Lumbagan said blurrily. “I don’t 
know what come over me, Retief. 
It was like Festival time and 
Spring Rites and the Fall Offen- 
sive all hit me at once. All of a sud- 
den I was raring to go. Too bad 
that Terry got away. I would have 
liked to field-strip the little rascal 
Just to see what color Juice ran 
out of him.’’ He eyed Retiefs pris- 
oner wistfully. “The fit’s passed — 
but I still got kind of a lingering 
urge to pull that Terry apart, one 
skinny leg at a time.’’ 

Far away, an alarm bell clanged 
harshly. 

“Now are you undone, abomin- 
able intruders,’’ the Groaci hissed. 
“In moments my well-trained 
guards will fall upon you, your 
misshapen members to distribute 
over the immediate landscape.’’ 



“Retief, 'we have to get out of 
here at once,’’ Magnan yelped. “If 
a platoon of Peace-keepers should 
get their nasty little digits on us — ’’ 
“Yeah, let’s blow,’’ Gloot 
agreed. “Me and cops never did get 
on too good together.’’ 

VIII 

R etief released the Groaci, 
who at once darted for cover 
behind the nearest rank of cages. 
The hall was empty. A lone Peace- 
keeper appeared at the far end of 
the corridor and set up a weak 
shout as they dashed for the store- 
room. Inside, Retief and Gloot 
paused long enough to stack a half- 
dozen crates against the door 
before ascending to the roof. Mag- 
nan was at the parapet, staring 
down into the darkness. 

“Trapped,” he hissed. “Retief— 
the grounds are swarming with 
them! And — ” he uttered a stifled 
exclamation. “Retief! Look!” 

In the gloom below Retief could 
discern the forms of several dozen 
armed troops in flaring helmets, 
polished greaves and spined hip. 
cloaks, moving efficiently out to 
surround the building. 

“Retief — what does it mean? 
This laboratory, hidden in the 
wilds; that insane monster farm 
and that horrible little Nith — and 
his obscure experiments — and now 
Groaci troops secretly garrisoned 
in the boondock?” 

“It means we know enough now

for a preliminary report. If you’ll 
give Ambassador. Pouncetrifle the 
details of what we’ve learned — ” 
“But, Retief— what have we 
learned?” 

“That the Groaci have worked 
out a method of controlling Lum- 
bagan evolution, plus a method of 
selectively stimulating the natives’ 
natural love of hostilities.” 

“But— whatever for?” 

“You’d better get going now, 
Mr. Magnan, I seem to hear the 
sounds of a posse pounding on the 
door down below.” 

“Get going? You sp-speak as 
though I we-were expected to de- 
scend alone into that lion’s den!” 
“Not descend — ascend. The cop- 
ter is a standard Groaci export 
model — ” 

“Yes, but— but I don’t have my 
driver’s license with me!” 

A loud thumping sounded from 
below as the stacked cases toppled. 
Gloot slammed the trapdoor and 
stood on it. 

“Better hurry, Mr. Magnan,” 
Retief said. “Head due west and 
stay clear of the peaks.” 

Magnan made vague sounds of 
protest, but scrambled awkwardly 
into the copter. He pressed the 
starter; the rotors turned, spun 
quickly up to speed. 

“It seems a trifle irresponsible, 
dashing off and leaving you here 
alone, Retief,’’ he called and 
winced as thunderous pounding 
shook the trapdoor. 

“I hope them Terries don’t take 



a notion to send a few rounds of ex- 
plosive slugs through this hatch,” 
Gloot said, struggling for balance 
as the door heaved under him. 

“ — but as you point out, duty 
calls,” Magnan added quickly and, 
with a hasty wave, lifted off into 
the night. 



44¥ DON’T get it,” Gloot said 
as the sound of the machine 
faded. “You said Ambassador 
Pouncetrifle? I thought he was the 
head Terry.” 

“I think it’s time for me to clear 
up a slight misapprehension you’ve 
bwn laboring under, Gloot,” Re- 
tief said. “Those aren’t actually 
Terries down there — they’re 
Groaci.” 

“Huh? But they look just like 
what’s-his-face, Nith, only bigger!” 
“Correct. That’s because Nith is 
a Groaci, too.” 

“But if he’s a Groaci — then what 
about whozis — the one that just 
run out on us?” 

“Mr. Magnan,” Retief confided, 
“is actually a Terry.” 

“Aha! I should of known. Talk 
about masters of disguise. Pretty 
slick, the way you got rid of 
him — ” Gloot paused reflectively. 
“But — if they’re Groaci down 
there, how come we don’t just open 
up and shake hands all around?” 
“They think I’m a Terry.” 

“Oh, boy, that complicates 
things. How come you don’t tell

IF 




’em who you really are and — ” 
‘^Undercover operation.” 

“Oh, I get it. Or do I?” Gloot 
said vaguely. “But I guess I can 
worry about that later, after we get 
out of this mess. What nifty trick 
are you going to pull out of the 
hat now? Frankly, if I didn’t have 
lots of confidence in you, Retief, 
I’d be getting worried about now.” 
“I think you may as well go 
ahead and worry, Gloot,” Retief 
said. “On this occasion I’m fresh 
out of hats.” 

“You mean — ” 

The hatch gave a tremendous 
lurch, sending the Lumbagan stag- 
gering. It flew open and a Groaci 
warrior bounded forth, power gun 
aimed, his fellows crowding out be- 
hind him. 

“He means, nocuous encroach- 
er, that now indeed is your fate up- 
on you!” The white-jacketed 
Groaci technician moved forward. 

“How about it, Retief,” Gloot 
said from the corner of his mouth. 
“We could jump ’em — but what I 
say is, why give ’em the fun of 
blowing us into sausage?” 

“Wait!” a piercing voice called 
from the rear. 

The Groaci soldiery fell back, 
came to rigid attention. In the sud- 
den silence the technician ducked 
his head servilely, stepping aside as 
an impressive figure wrapped in a 
black cloak with a twist of gold 
braid adorning the stiff collar 
strode forward. Typically Groa- 
cian except for his six-foot height. 



the newcomer stared Retief up 
and down, ignoring G16ot. 

“So, impetuous Terry,” he 
rasped in a voice surprisingly 
vigorous for a Groaci. “We meet 
at last.” 

“Swarmmaster Ussh, I pre- 
sume?” Retief said. “Your Ulti- 
mateness has led us an interest- 
ing chase.’*’ 

“And one pursued to your inde- 
scribable sorrow,” Ussh grated. 



<4¥’VE SEEN your experimen- 
¥tal monster farm,” Retief 
said. “The woods seem full of un- 
successful experiments in forced 
evolution.” 

“As I suspected, the true impli- 
cations of what you’ve seen has 
been lost on your limited imagina- 
tion. Soon, however — ” 

“I think I got it. Manipulating 
Lumbagans at random is all very 
well, but it would be a bit difficult 
to stage anything more organized 
than a free-for-all unless you could 
elicit uniform responses. Ergo — 
uniform puppets.” 

“You’ve correctly gauged the 
more pedestrian portions of my 
plot, Terran dupe! But you’ve 
failed utterly to grasp the incred- 
ible scope of my true greatness! 
While you dashed hither and thith- 
er, assembling your trifling clues, 
my giant intellect has been coolly 
completing the flnal detail work. 
And now — tonight — the New Age 
dawns, ushered in by the successor

to all previous life forms, namely 
myself!” 

“What is this guy, nuts or some- 
thing?” Gloot muttered. “If he’s 
so busy why’s he standing around 
making speeches?” 

“He’s trying to find out how 
much we know,” Retief said. 

Swarmmaster Ussh waved a 
negligent hand. “Petty minds can 
but ascribe petty motives. What 
you may or may not know is a mat- 
ter of supreme indifference — and I 
include any fragmentary facts in 
the possession of your flown ac- 
complice, for whose absence from 
this group certain incompetents 
will suffer. In fact, I freely confide 
in you: tonight I assume planetary 
rule. Tomorrow I issue -my -ulti- 
matum to the Galaxy. Next week — 
but contain yourself in patience. 
You yourself — in chains, of course 
— shall serve as my emissary to 
carry the terms to your -former 
masters! As for the Untouchable, 
you may retain him as your per- 
sonal menial.” 

“I assumed you had a reason for 
not shooting us immediately. 

“I do nothing without a su- 
premely practical motive.” Ussh 
stated flatly. “And now — will you 
go to your durance peacefully or 
will it be necessary for me to have 
you dragged by the heels, a most 
undignifi^ progress for a future 
Slave Ambassador.” 

“I think a period of quiet con- 
templation may be just what we 
need at this point,” Retief said. 



T he dungeon into which Retief 
and Gloot were conducted cut 
deep into the rock beneath the se- 
cret Groaci lab, was a damp cham- 
ber, six feet by eight, without lights, 
furniture or other amenities. The 
narrow portal through which they 
had entered was barred by a thick 
door of solid iron. The ceiling was 
a seamless surface of rough-hewn 
stone, as were the walls and floor. 

“At least we got a drain hole,” 
Gloot commented after they had 
conducted an examination of their 
prison by the light of Retiefs cigar 
lighter. “If worst gets to worst, I 
can always flush myself down the 
sewer; but don’t worry, pal. I’ll 
stick around and keep you com- 
pany until you starve to death be- 
fore I split — and I do mean split.” 
“That’s thoughtful Gloot, but 
maybe it won’t come to that.” 

“Aha — so you have got a couple 
aces up your sleeve. I figured. 
Come on, Retief, let me in on the 
scheme. How are we going to hoist 
these Terries — ” 

“Groaci.” 

“Whatever you call ’em, I still 
don’t like ’em. What dramatic 
stroke are we going to bring off 
now?” 

“First we find a comfortable 
spot on the floor,” Retief said. 

“Yeah? Okay, I’m with you so 
far.” 

“Then we wait.” 

“I’ll be frank with you, Retief: 
somehow the program don’t sound 
too promising.” 



92 



IF 




“It’s all I have to offer at the 
moment.” 

“Oh.” A pause. “Are we, ah, 
waiting for anything in <particu- 
lar?” 

“I’d be inclined to jump at any- 
thing that comes along.” 

“You must be joshing, Retief. 
How can anything come along to 
jump at. We’re locked up in an un- 
derground dungeon with only one 
hole in it, namely the one the bilge 
runs out of?” 

“That narrows it down,” Retief 
conceded. 

“You mean — ” 

“Shhh— listen.” 

A faint rustling sound became 
audible. Retief thumbed his light- 
er; the pale flame cast a feeble glow 
across the slimy floor. 

Something stirred below the 
four-inch drain orifice. 

An eyeball crept into view on 
spidery legs, swiveling to look 
around the cell before emerging on- 
to the floor. Behind it an ear flut- 
tered up the shaft, circled the 
chamber, came to rest in a far cor- 
ner. A hand crawled into view, 
paused to hold up two fingers in a 
V, then turned to assist a set of 
sweetbreads over the coping. 

“Cripes,” Gloot muttered as 
more and more Freebies swarmed 
into the cell. “What is this, a con- 
vention? The place is crawling with 
vermin!” 

“Steady, Gloot,” Retief cau- 
tioned. “When I said jump, 1 didn’t 
mean literally.” 



“It figures the crumbums would 
stick us in a hole infested with 
parasites!” 

“Keep your voice down, Gloot. 
If our jailors suspect we have 
guests, they’ll soon be along to 
break up the party.” 

“Yeah — even a bunch o’ Ter- 
ries — or Groaci — foreigners, any- 
way — ought to have the decency 
to fumigate the place if we put up 
a howl — ” Gloot broke off, his 
mouth hanging open in an expres- 
sion of horrified outrage. “Why, 
the lousy, dirty, obscene little 
buggers!” he gasped. “Right out 
in public, too!” 

Under the feeble beam of the 
lighter, the eyeball had edged close 
to a generously proportioned nose 
which waited coyly for its advance. 
They touched, groped— and melt- 
ed into a close embrace. A second 
eye appeared from the drain, 
glanced around, rushed to the con- 
joining couple and promptly took 
up a position on the opposite side 
of the nose. An upper lip linked 
with them, as other candidates 
crowded around, while more and 
more streamed up from the depths. 

“It’s — it’s a regular orgy, like I 
heard about but never got in on!” 
Gloot blurted, and raised a large, 
booted foot to stamp out the ob- 
jectionable spectacle; Retief caught 
his ankle barely in time, dumped 
him on his back. 

“Easy, Gloot,” he said. “It’s 
time you faced up to the facts of 
life.” 



THE ALU-TOGETHER PLANET

“Just wait until I get my other 
lung in place,’’ a breathy voice 
squeaked from the direction of the 
congregating singletons, “and I’ll 
give that big hypocrite a piece of 
my mind! Maybe that’ll raise his 
IQ to the moron level so he can 
understand me when I tell him 
what I think of him.’’ 

“I thought maybe it was you 
who’s been dogging my foot- 
steps,’’ Retief said. “Welcome 
aboard, Ignarp. You couldn’t have 
come at a better time.’’ 

IX 

THAT’S our Big Secret, 
i^Retief,’’ Ignarp said five 
minutes later. He was completely 
reassembled now, his component 
parts having settled into position 
and accommodated themselves so 
perfectly that the lines of juncture 
were barely visible. Being able to 
reassemble gives us a big advan- 
tage. That’s why the rest of ’em are 
out to get us!’’ 

“The reasons normal Lumbag- 
ans got no use for these degener- 
ates,” Gloot stated with contempt, 
“is on account of they got no finer 
feelings. When they put theirselfs 
together thataway, they as good as 
admit all us Lumbagans evolved 
from lower formal” 

“Ontogeny recapitulates philog- 
eny,” Ignarp said smugly. “Every- 
body knows that.” 

“Sure — but decent folks don’t 
admit it!” 



“Which brings us to the ques- 
tion of why you trailed me here,” 
Retief said. 

“I tdld you I’d keep an eye on 
you — ” 

“Yes, I saw it fluttering in the 
middle distance.” 

“And it looks to me like maybe 
things are even worse than we 
thought. And you’re the only one 
that maybe can do something 
about it. Ergo — here I am. What 
can I do? Get you some light read- 
ing matter? Take last messages to 
loved ones?” 

“Better yet, you can get us out of 
here.” 

“I don’t know, Retief,” Ignarp 
said, eyeing Gloot, who stood at 
the far side of the cell, arms folded, 
a sullen expression on his face. 
“Why should I go to bail this clod 
out of stir?” 

“Because I’m afraid my plan 
won’t work without him,” Retief 
said. 

“Who needs him?” Ignarp chal- 
lenged. “All I have to do is slide 
back out the way I came in — ” 

“I still don’t believe it,” Gloot 
muttered. “Me — associating with 
this degenerate. Having to stand 
here and listen to him talk about 
it.” 

“ — infiltrate the building and re- 
assemble inside. Then, when you 
pound on the door and yell and the 
guard comes to work you over with 
the rubber hoses, I jump out and 
nail him.” 

“I got a better idea,” Gloot said. 



94 



IF 




“Retief, you lend your coat to this 
deviate: we set up a yell, and when 
the bums come running, they open 
the door and see the two of you up 
against the wall thumbing your 
noses. Naturally, they come 
charging in — and I jump out 
behind ’em and lay ’em low.” 
“Some plan,” Ignarp com- 
mented. “They see Retief without 
his coat and a total strainer wear- 
ing it, and that’s supposed to lull 
their suspicions?” 

“Okay, / borrow his coat — ” 

“So they see him without a coat 
and me naked — and. they figure 
I’m you, only two feet shorter and 
better looking — ” 

“No, I got it. Retief borrows my 
coat—” 

“You’re not wearing one, dum- 
my. 

“So he keeps his coat! You get 
back of the door — ” 

“Don’t tell me what to do, tall, 
spotted, and grotesque!” 

“You got a nerve, short, blotchy, 
and depraved! I got a go<^ 
mind—” 

“Want to bet? We do it my way. 
See you later, Retief—” 

“How about waiting long 
enough to hear my proposal, Ig- 
narp?” 

“Well — okay. Who wears your 
coat?” 

“I do. It’s you two fellows who 
have some changes to make.” 
“Huh?” Gloot said uneasily. 
“What you got in mind?” Ig- 
narp said suspiciously. 



“Somethii^ far worse than you 
think,” Retief said. “Tell me, Ig- 
narp, how would you like to see 
Lumbaga pacified by a dictator?” 
“You kidding? We like to fight 
among ourselves. Having all the fat 
in the hands of the exploiting 
classes is bad enough without some 
spoilsport depriving us of our na- 
tional sport and pastime. Forget it, 
Retief—” 



’D BE glad to, but I’m afraid 
a fellow named Ussh has a 
more tenacious memory. Uidess 
we do something to stop it, by this 
time tomorrow Lumbaga will be at 
peace — permanently.” 

“Well, what are we hanging 
around here for?” Ignarp de- 
manded. “Let’s try my [dan, 
and — ” 

“All the more reason to get go- 
ing on my plan!” Gloot cut in. 

“Gentlemen,” Retief inter- 
rupted, “there comes a time in any 
friendly fight when it’s wise to 
pause and give a thought to con- 
sequences. *At this moment the op- 
position is busy putting the finish- 
ing touches on a plan that’s been 
years in the making. The occupy- 
ing armies are already marchii^ on 
the capital — and we’re sealed in a 
vault forty feet underground, en- 
gaged in a jurisdictional dispute.” 
“Uh — well — ” Gloot said. 

“It doesn’t look good, does it?” 
Ignarp said soberly. 

“The proposals now before us,” 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET 



95 




Retief said, “would afford a few 
satisfying cracks at the heads of 
our captors and might even get us 
as far as the end of the hall before 
the inevitable end. What’s required 
is a plan with sufficient scope to 
carry us through to a successful 
conclusion.’’ 

“I’ll buy that,’’ Gloot said. 
“But—’’ 

“Out with it, Retief,’’ Ignarp 
said. “I’ve got a funny feeling I’m 
not going to like this.’’ 

“Probably not,’’ Retief agreed. 
In a few brief words, he outlined 
his proposal. 

A stunned silence followed. 

“Retief! And I thought you were 
a fine, upstanding fellow — for a 
foreigner,’’ Ignarp berated him 
weakly. 

“If I hadn’t heard it I wouldn’t 
have believed it,’’ Gloot said in a 
choked voice. 

“Well, how about it, gentle- 
men?’’ Retief said. “We don’t have 
much time.’’ 

“You expect me to lend coun- 
tenance to a thing like that?’’ Ig- 
narp protested. “It’s’enough to 
make your eyebrows crawl !’’ 

“What if my friends heard about 
it?” Gloot muttered. 

“It’s not traditional,” Ignarp 
complained. 

“It’s against nature.” 

“Mongrelization — ” 

“I’ll be dragged down to his lev- 
el—” 

“It’ll never work.” 

“Couldn’t we talk about it first? 



For a few years, say — or maybe a 
century or so?” 

“It’s now or never, fellows,” 
Retief said. “After tomorrow ev- 
ery Lumbagan on the planet will be 
herded into a Freeby farm and 
integrated forcibly, regardless of 
his sensitivities.” 

“Me?” Gloot said. “And that— 
that— dilettante?” 

“That — that oof — and me?” Ig- 
narp wailed. 

“It’s that — or something 

worse,” Retief said with finality. 

“Could you at least — douse the 
light?” Ignarp said. 

“I need a shot o’ rum,” Gloot 
said. 

“Of course.” Retief handed over 
his flask and switched off; the dim 
glow faded. 

In the darkness there were soft, 
tentative scufflings, faint mutter- 
ings; Retief paced the cell — three 
paces, back three paces — whistling 
softly to himself. 

Time passed. 

Silence fell. Retief paused. 

“Ready, gentlemen?” 

“We — I — guess so,” a curiously 
mellow voice answered. Then, 
more strongly; “Yes, ready, Re- 
tief.” 

He flicked on the lighter. In its 
glow stood not the dumpy Ignarp 
nor the lanky Gloot, but a tall, 
superbly muscled figure, brawny 
arms folded over a mighty chest, 
four golden eyes glowing from a 
broad and noble brow alight with 
intellect.

IF 




6<¥¥OW do I — we look?”"the 
^Tlidealized Lumbagan in- 
quired. 

“Ready for anything,” Retief 
said. “By the way, what do I call 
you now? Somehow neither Ig- 
noop nor Glarp seems to fit the 
new you.” 

“What about — Lucael?” 

“It’s better t)ian Michifer. Now, 
Luke — if you’ll pardon the famil- 
iarity — I think we’d best get on 
with the next phase without delay.” 
“The next phase?” 

“As the first Octuple Lumbagan 
in history, I assume you have 
unique abilities. Let’s find out what 
they are.” 

“Yes — I see. The conclusion is 
logical. By introspection, I note 
that I have, of course, enhanced 
physical strength and endurance, 
exceptionally keen hearing and vi- 
sion.” Lucael paused. “A most in- 
teresting effect,” he said. “By 
bringing either pair of eyes to bear 
on an object, I of course achieve 
the familiar stereoscopic effect: 
three-dimensional sight — a vast 
improvement over the monocular 
vision of the former Gloot identity. 
But when I bring both pairs into 
play simultaneously, channeling 
the impression through my com- 
pound occipital lobes, there is an 
exponential improvement. I can 
clearly perceive nine dimen-’ 
sions: five spatial, two temporal, 
and two more the nature of which 
will require careful analysis — ” 
the resonant baritone faded off as 



Lucael stared, somewhat cross- 
eyed, at the corner of the room. 

“You’ll have plenty of time later 
for research in depth, Luke. For 
the moment we’d better stick to the 
practical applications.” 

“Of course. The first order of 
business, clearly, is to adjust spa- 
tial coordinates in such fashion 
that our loci lie external to the en- 
closure by which we are at present 
circumscribed.” 

“Unequivocally, if not succint- 
ly, put. Any suggestions?” 

“Hmmm.” Lucael glanced at 
each of the four walls in turn. 
“Solid rock to a depth of several 
hundred feet on all sides.” He 
stared at the floor. “Twenty-five 
miles of rock, underlain by a vis- 
cous fluid at high temperature and 
pressure. Fascinating!” 

“That leaves the ceiling,” Retief 
prompted. 

“To be sure.” Lucael glanced up. 
“Yes, this is the simplest route.” 
He glanced at Retief. “Shall we 
go?” 

“After you.” 

The super-Lumbagan nodded, 
folded his arms — both pairs — and 
rose gently from the floor. In the 
moment before his head would 
have contacted the ceiling the 
rocky surface seemed to shimmer, 
fading suddenly to invisibility! 
Without pausing, Lucael rose 
steadily up, waist, knees, ankles, to 
disappear from sight. A moment 
later a sharp, breathy cry sounded, 
followed by a dull thump. 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET

R ETIEF crouched, jumped, 
caught the edge of the circular 
opening now miraculously existing 
in the stone slab, pulled himself up 
into what appeared to be a guard- 
room. A lone Groaci lay stretched 
on the floor, peacefully snoring. 

'"It was necessary to numb his 
cortical synapses — temporarily, of 
course,” Lucael said apologetical- 
ly. "Poor little creature, so full of 
vain plans and misconceptions.” 
"Aren’t we all,” Retief said. 
"Luke, let’s see how good you are 
at finding things at a distance. We 
need fast transportation.” 

"Let me see . Hmmm. I de- 
tect a boat at a distance of three 
hundred yards on an azimuth of 
181 " 24 '.” 

"What kind of boat?” 

"A hand-hewn canoe sunk in 
four fathoms of water. There’s a 
large hole in the bottom.” 

"Skip that one, Luke. How 
about a nice two-man copter?” 

"No — nothing like that. How- 
ever, I note a modest power launch 
lying at anchor some two miles to 
the east.” 

"Ensign Yubb must still be busy 
pacifying the army. I believe his 
boat was powered by a small fu- 
sion jet. I don’t suppose — ” 

"I’ve already started it,” Lucael 
said. "Just a moment while I lift 
the anchor— there. Now, let me 
see: which is reverse? Oh, yes. 
Now, all ahead, half speed until 
she’s past the bar — ” 

"Nice work, Luke. While you’re 



bringing her around to this side of 
the island take a quick scan of the 
building.” 

"Very well. A guard or two doz- 
ing in the keep. Two Groaci in sick 
bay with contusions. Half a dozen 
unfortunates lodged in the brig. 
Ussh seems to be gone. Yes, I de- 
tect his aura — ^^a most powerful one 
— some ten miles t9 the east, trav- 
eling fast.” 

"It’s time we emulated him. 
Let’s go, Luke; we don’t want to 
miss all the excitement.” 

"You refer to the moment when 
Ussh announces his assumption of 
power and his program of Galactic 
conquest?” 

"No,” Retief said. "J mean the 
moment when he discovers that 
Newton’s Third Law applies to 
politicians as well as ping-pong 
balls.” 

They met no opposition as they 
left the now almost deserted build- 
ing. Lucael picked a route down 
the hill through the dense woods to 
emerge on the beach just as the 
unmanned power launch rounded 
the curve of the shore and headed 
in toward the beach. They splashed 
out through the shallows as the 
engine cut; the boat glided silently 
up to them. Aboard, Lucael re- 
started the engines and Retief took 
the helm. 

♦ "Ussh’s first column has just en- 
tered the city from the west,” Lu- 
cael announced. "He himself is at 
this moment leading a procession 
along Brigand Street toward the 



98 



IF 




palace. Rioting seems to be pro- 
ceeding as usual."" 

“Let"s be grateful for His Ulti- 
mateness"s fondness for dramatic 
gestures,"’ Retief said. “If he’ll oc- 
cupy himself with his victory pa- 
rade for an hour or so we may be in 
time.” 

“In time to thwart his coup?” 

“Probably not. But with luck in 
time to ^tage a small coup of our 
own.” He opened the throttles and 
the powerful boat surged ahead 
across the dark water toward the 
city lights fifteen miles to, the east. 

T he shadowy shapes of Groo- 
groo, Delerion and Rumboogie 
rose in turn from the darkness, slid 
past on the port side, dwindled 
astern, none showing any signs of 
life with the exception of a few 
small campfires glowing high on 
their forested slopes. Ahead, the 
lights of Thieves’ Harbor spread 
wider, reaching out to enclose them 
as they passed the breakwater. The 
wharves were deserted as the sleek 
craft nosed up to the Municipal 
Pier. 

Retief cut the power, tossed a 
line around a piling and jumped to 
the wharf. 

“The place looks strange with- 
out at least one small street fight in 
progress,” he said. “Apparently it 
takes a war to bring peace to 
Lumbaga.” 

“The crowds have gathered near 
the palace complex,” Lucael said. 
“A cordon of armed troops sur- 



rounds the area. Ussh is in the ball- 
room, in company with a number 
of off-worlders.” 

“Is Ambassador Pouncetrifle 
among those present?” Retief de- 
scribed the Terran Plenipotentiary. 
Lucael confirmed that he was in- 
cluded in the group. 

“They seem to be linked togeth- 
eT,” the super-Lumbagan added, 
“by means of a chain attached to a 
series of metal collars which in turn 
encircle their necks.” 

“Apparently Ussh intends to es- 
tablish a no-nonsense foreign pol- 
icy,” Retief commented. “The 
idea has merit, but in the present 
case we’ll have to try to introduce a 
little nonsense after all.” 

“Interference may prove diffi- 
cult. All entrances are blocked by 
the crowd. I can of course levitate 
myself to any desired point within 
the atmosphere, but the amount of 
extra weight I’m capable of carry- 
ing is limited.” 

“Piggyback is out, then. Let’s 
try the back door where your Ig- 
narp segment and I first met.” 

Retief led the way across the 
plaza and down Dacoit street, 
poorly lit by the widely spaced gas- 
lamps, deserted now, littered with 
the forlorn fiotsam crowds leave 
behind. They were within a hun- 
dred feet of the inconspicuous door 
when a small party of helmeted 
and greaved Groaci soldiers 
emerged suddenly from a narrow 
cross street ahead. The officer in 
charge hissed an order; his troops 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET

spread out to block the way, then 
one by one crumpled to the cobble- 
stones. The officer, the last on his 
feet, stared uncomprehendingly at 
his collapsing command, then be- 
latedly jerked his pistol from its 
sequinned holster only to drop it, 
totter two steps, and fall. 

Lucael staggered back against 
the wall of the building beside 
them, his face working like yeast. 

“Geeze — I just had the screwiest 
nightmare,” he muttered, almost in 
Gloot’s voice. “Another — lousy 
trick by — unprincipled exploiters, 
ril wager,” he added in Ignarp’s 
petulant tones. 

“Luke! Pull yourself together!” 
Retief snapped. “You can’t afford 
to go to pieces now!” 

Lucael’s features twifched and 
subsided. The four golden eyes 
settled back into position. 

“I — find that — there are limita- 
tions to my power output,” he said 
weakly. 

“Come on, Luke. Just a little 
farther.” They covered the re- 
maining yards to the doorway. 
The heavy door opened on the 
musty passage. 

“From now on save your 
strength for emergencies,” Retief 
said. “I think I can guarantee 
there’ll be a steady supply.” 

T 'HEY threaded the route 
through the dusty passages, as- 
cended the stairs to the kitchens, 
which they found deserted and 
showing signs of rapid evacuation. 



A cramped spiral service stair led 
from an alcove beside the dumb- 
waiter to the upper stories. At the 
top, faint voices muttered beyond 
the door which opened into the pri- 
vate-apartment wing. 

“A party of minor Groaci offi- 
cials,” Lucael said, speaking with 
his eyes closed. “They seem to be 
placing wagers as to whether Terra 
will be granted colony status or 
merely regarded as conquered ter- 
ritory.” He paused. “They’re gone 
now.” 

Retief eased the outer door open 
half an inch; crimson carpet led to 
a pair of massive, carved purple- 
wood inner doors, just closing be- 
hind the sporting aliens. Retief 
went swiftly forward, got a foot 
between the doors before they 
closed. The anteroom beyond was 
empty; through a low, arched open- 
ing. the barbarically splendid 
ballroom was visible, crowded with 
a mixed throng of locals and aliens. 
In an elaborately carved chair at 
the far end of the room sat a 
towering Lumbagan draped in a 
robe of Imperial purple, flanked on 
one side by Colonel Suash at the 
head of an honor guard of matched 
native troops in shining cuirasses 
and polished helms, power guns at 
present arms, impressive in spite 
of a number of black eyes and 
bandages in evidence. At the oth- 
er side of the throne stood a de- 
tachment of Groaci Peace-keep-v 
ers in full uniform. A gaggle of 
Groaci functionaries, including 



100 



IF 




Ambassador Jith, stood nearby. 
Ambassador Pouncetrifle, lean- 
ing sideways because of the 
weight of the chain on his neck, 
stood before the throne; a dozen 
or so members of his staff hud- 
dled behind him in a tight group, 
none apparently craving the 
honor of sharing the front rank 
with the Chief of Mission. 

“ . sensible of the honor and 
all that, your Imperial Highness,” 
the Terran Ambassador was say- 
ing, “but see here, I can’t simply 
offer Terran recognition of your 
regime on my own authority.” 

“Let’s simplify the proposition,” 
a deep bass voice boomed from the 
Imperial chair. “Acknowledge our 
divine right and sign the treaty and 
we’ll allow you to linger to observe 
our coronation before you are 
whipped back to your kennels.” 

“Ah, if I might venture an ob- 
servation — ” A faint voice spoke 
up from the Groaci delegation. 
Ambassador Jith stepped forward. 
“While one fully appreciates the 
eminent propriety of the installa- 
tion of a native Lumbagan regime 
entertaining kindly sentiments to- 
ward the Groacian state — ” 

“Yes, yes, get on with it!” the 
enthroned Lumbagan rumbled. 

“To be sure. Your Imperial 
Highness — I merely meant to sug- 
gest that perhaps a less precipitate 
approach to the question of rec- 
ognition — ” 

“Our photograph, hand-tinted 
by skilled coolies, will be distrib- 



uted to every village, hamlet, and 
town in the Eastern Arm. Recog- 
nition wise, we’ll be better known 
than that fellow Whatzizname who 
won the nogdle-knitting contest on 
TV!” 

“Doubtless, sire, your fame will 
be quickly spread abroad — ” 

“No broads! As an asexual race, 
we Lumbagans look with disfavor 
on any sport we can’t get in on. 
That’s enough of the subject. On 
with the formalities.” His High- 
ness favored Pouncetrifle with a 
scowl involving three eyes and four 
eyebrows. “Well, what about it, 
Terran? Do you want to acknowl- 
edge the legitimacy of our gra- 
cious rule and receive an exe- 
quatur allowing you to go on us- 
ing up our Lumbagan air — or 
would you prefer to play a stellar 
role in the first death sentence we 
hand down from our newly estab- 
lished throne?” 

“Apparently Your Imperial 
Highness is having his little jape,” 
Jith hissed in apparent dismay. 
“As Groacian Plenipotentiary, I 
must advise that the Groacian state 
would look with extreme disfavor 
on the establishment of any un- 
fortunate precedent with regard 
to informal methods of diplo- 
mat disposal. A simple declara- 
tion of persona non grata — ” 

“Nope. Italian food gives us 
heartburn,” the Imperial figure 
decreed. “And if we hear any more 
static from aliens of any persua- 
sion we might just revise our whole 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET

plan for Galactic enlightenment to 
include you Groaci out!” 

A n unusually tail and ro- 
bust Groaci stepped forward 
from the rear rank. 

“Ussh!” Lucael whispered. 

“Pm sure that matters need not 
come to that,” Ussh said unctious- 
ly, “Doubtless His Excellency, on 
further consideration, will wish to 
withdraw his objection.” 

The Emperor-elect, who had 
slumped rather vaguely on his 
throne as the Groaci spoke, sat up 
alertly. 

“Very well; on with the execu- 
tions. We’ll make a note to send for 
a fresh set of Terries more amen- 
able to reason — ” 

“To protest this unwarranted as- 
sumption of authority,” Jith whis- 
pered urgently in his own language 
to Ussh. “To remind you — Special 
Appointee or otherwise — that I am 
ranking Groacian official here!” 

“I see no reason to coddle Ter- 
ran spies,” the other replied in 
Lumbagan. “This is Groac’s op- 
portunity to get in on the ground 
floor — why annoy His Imperial 
Highness with minor quibbles on 
technical points?” 

“To point out that once these na- 
tives begin lopping alien heads, 
Groaci organ clusters may be next 
to roll.” 

RetieFs companion was staring 
at nothing, his eyes half closed. 
Ussh stirred uneasily, looked 
around the ornate room. 



“It appears that I now confront 
an intellect equal or superior to 
my own,” Lucael murmured. 
“He sensed my touch and instant- 
ly erected barriers, the strength of 
which I cannot assess.” 

“Enough!” the enthroned Lum- 
bagan spoke up abruptly, as if re- 
turning from a reverie. “Cap- 
tain — ”he pointed a limber digk at 
the guard chief — “escort the con- 
demned to the courtyard and give 
your marksmen some unscheduled 
target practice. No need to finish 
them off in a hurry; just keep pep- 
pering away until they stop twitch- 
mg. 

“Time to move,” Retief said. 
“Luke — stay out of sight and keep 
an eye on Ussh. No matter what 
happens, stay tuned to him — and 
don’t tip your hand prematurely.” 
“What’s your plan, Retief? I’m 
not at all sure I can control him — ” 
“No time for plans; we’ll have to 
play it by ear,” Retief said and 
thrust the doors wide. 

“Hold everything gentlemen,” 
he said as all eyes turned toward 
him. “There are new dispatches 
just in from the hustings that cast a 
different complexion on mat- 
ters.” 



X 

F or a moment total silence 
gripped the chamber. 

Then: “Seize him!” Ussh 

snarled. When the guards failed to 



102 



IF 




move he repeated the order in a 
shout. 

‘‘Don’t slip out of character, 
Ussh,” Retief said. “You’re just a 
Groaci MHPP, remember? The 
troops work for His Putative 
Highness the Emperor-to-be.” 

“Retief!” Pouncetrifle blurted 
hastily in Terran. “Run for it, 
man! The official comset is in my 
quarters, at the back of the ward- 
robe under my golf clubs. Send 
out a code three-oh-two — ” 

“Uh — what about it, Your 
Highness?” Colonel Suash said 
hesitantly, still standing fast. “Is 
it your command to nab this 
foreigner?” 

The would-be emperor’s mouth 
sagged slightly open. His expres- 
sion was that of someone lost in 
thought. 

“His Highness — ” Ussh said and 
paused. He seemed to be strug- 
gling silently with himself. 

“Looking for just the right word, 
Ussh?” Retief inquired amiably. 
He turned to the colonel. “Relax 
Suash,” he said. “As you can see. 
His Highness is having second 
thoughts on a number of mat- 
ters.” 

“Take — ” the Emperor said. Re- 
tief took a swift step toward Ussh, 
who recoiled. 

“Stand back, Terran!” he 
hissed. 

“Your Highness?” said Colonel 
Suash, staring up at the musing 
figure on the throne. 

“Ughhrrr,” the royal claimant 



said, gazing vacantly into space. 

“Ah — Your Highness?” Suash 
repeated. “In the, uh, absence of 
any new orders, I presume I must 
carry out the executions?” 

“Just a minute. Colonel,” Re- 
tief said. “You Lumbagans don’t 
take orders from foreigners, do 
you?” 

“Not on your second-best toupee 
I don’t,” the officer snapped. “So 
don’t try to give me any!” 

“By no means. Colonel. I’m re- 
ferring to Swarmmaster Ussh, who 
represents himself as a Special 
Appointee of the Groacian High 
Council.” 

“I don’t take orders from him 
either.” 

“No,” Retief said, and pointed 
to the throne, “but his would-be 
Highness does.” 

“What?” The officer half drew 
his dress sword and turned to the 
emperor-elect. “Do you mind if I 
chop this foreigner down right 
here, Your Highness, for that 
crack he just made about you?” 

“Ungunggunggg,” the en- 
throned Lumbagan mumbled. 
His head rolled on his shoulder; 
his mouth hung slackly open. 
Abruptly he closed it, pulled him- 
self upright. 

“We were just, ah, pondering 
our next pronouncement,” he said 
briskly, as Retief took another 
step toward Ussh, who stood 
frozen, two eyes canted tautly to- 
ward the throne, the other three 
hanging limp. At the Terran’s ad- 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET 



103 




vance, he spun to face him. 

*‘Now, Colonel — ” the Em- 
peror-to-be paused, mouth open. 

“Yes, Your Highness?” the 
colonel watched in dismay as his 
ruler-presumptive’s expression 
relaxed into vacuity. 

“You might as well address your 
remarks to Ussh,” Retief advised 
the officer. “He’s the brains of the 
operation.’’ 

“See here, Retief,” Pouncetrifle 
spoke up. “The intellectual 
prowess of the Emperor is no con- 
cern of ours — ” 

“It’s the intellectual prowess of 
Ussh I’m thinking of at the mo- 
ment, Mr. Ambassador. He has a 
number of rather unusual capabil- 
ities.” 

“Lies!” Ussh shouted. “Fan- 
tasies! The ravings of a disordered 
imagination! I’ll see you all 
hanged for disrespect to His Im- 
perial Highness! It’s all a plot to 
discredit the people’s choice, 
elevated by acclamation to the 
Lumbagan throne!” He was in- 
terrupted by a slithering sound, 
followed by a heavy thump as the 
Emperor slid from the elaborate 
chair and sprawled full length on 
the dais, snoring gently. 

44¥T’S a plot, all right, Ussh— 
A but you’re the one behind it,” 
Retief said. “It wasn’t His Im- 
perial Highness who mobilized the 
troops and took the capital by 
storm — it was you.” 

“Guards! Shoot them down in 



their tracks for aggravated Use- 
majesteV^ Ussh shouted. 

“What about it. Colonel?” Re- 
tief addressed the guard chief. 
“Was it our slumbering host who 
gave the order to march on the 
capital?” 

“Well — not personally, of 
course. General Ussh notified 
me — but he was simply relaying 
His Imperial Highnesses’ com- 
mands — ” 

“Wasn’t it also Ussh who passed 
along the instructions that or- 
ganized your unit in the first place 
and handed out the orders regard- 
ing the secret laboratory?” 

“Here, that’s GUTS classifica- 
tion material you’re discussing!” 

“Not . any more. You’ve been 
taken in. Colonel. Those were all 
Ussh’s ideas—” 

“Mr. Retief!” Ambassador Jith 
spoke up. “May I remind you that 
I am Principal Officer here and 
that I have given no such instruc- 
tions to any member of the Groaci 
delegation — ” 

“I’m sure you haven’t, Mr. Am- 
bassador,” Retief said. “But Ussh 
seems to have taken it upon him- 
self to use your name.” 

“Very well!” Ussh hissed sud- 
denly, wheeling to face the irate 
Groaci, who shrank back. “Per- 
haps I have employed unconven- 
tional methods. But clearly it’s to 
Groac’s advantage to go along 
with the fait accompli] As soon as 
the Emperor is safely ensconced 
on his throne. I’m in a position to

IF 




assure you that Groac will be the 
object of very special attentions by 
His Imperial Majesty,” 

“What’s that?” Colonel Suash 
roared. “Are you suggesting that 
the Emperor o-f Lumbaga is 
nothing but a tool of foreign in- 
terests?” 

“Not at all, Suash,” Ussh 
hastened to reassure the officer. 
“Merely that the new Lumbagan 
government can rely on the full 
support of Groac.” He turned back 
to Jith. “What about it. Your Ex- 
cellency?” he said urgently. 
“You’ll agree that it’s clearly your 
duty to support His Highness’ 
claim — ” 

“Don’t listen to him, Jith,” 
Pouncetrifle blurted. “You’re 
quite right — Groac has no busi- 
ness whatever sticking its ol- 
factory organ into Lumbaga’s af- 
fairs, especially when I was right 
on the verge of proposing a well- 
rounded scheme for installing a 
provisional governing committee 
under Terran sponsorship — ” 

“You presume to tell me my 
duties, Harvey?” Jith cut in 
chillingly. “As my subordinate 
Swarmmaster Ussh so cogently 
points out, Groacian obligations 
in support of formerly exploited 
peoples require that I put aside 
ordinary protocols for the nonce 
and — ” 

“I don’t like it,” Suash spoke up. 
“It sounds to me as if you aliens 
are getting ready to slice Lum- 
baga up among yourselves! Ac- 



cordingly, as senior Lumbagan 
national present. I’m assuming 
temporary command. And my 
first act will be to order the lot of 
you to the port to embark inside 
of thirty minutes, with or without 
your suitcases!” 

“Fool!” Ussh snarled. “Do you 
imagine your feeble native regime 
can survive for a moment with- 
out the sponsorship of Groac? If 
it weren’t for His Highness’ 
temporary indisposition he’d 
have your head for this!” 

“And I might add, my dear 
Colonel,” JLith whispered piercing- 
ly, “that at a word from me, units 
of the Groacian Grand Battle 
Fleet are prepared, if necessary, 
to land and restore order here!” 

“You wouldn’t dare,” Pounce- 
trifle quavered, jowls aquiver. 

“Would I not?” Jith contra- 
dicted. “I see a great Groacian 
triumph in the offing! And now, 
Colonel,” he addressed the of- 
ficer, “you and your chaps may 
withdraw. I’m sure that His High- 
ness will be himself in a mo- 
ment—” 

The Emperor stirred, sat up. 

“Well, just felt a short nap com- 
ing on,” he mumbled as he 
scrambled to his feet. “Now, you 
just run along as Jith suggested, 
Suash, and — ” 

“How do you know what he sug- 
gested?” Suash snapped back. 

“You were out stone cold on the 
floor.” 

“Yes, well, as to that — ”

“He knows,” Relief said, “be- 
cause Ussh is feeding him his 
lines.” 

<4TJTAVE you taken leave of 
-Tlyour senses, Terran med- 
dler?” Ussh yelled. “Everyone in 
the room heard His Imperial 
Whatsit’s cogent comments!” 
“Uh-huh — but you were doing 
his thinking for him — what there 
was of it. Unhappily for the 
future of the empire, you can’t 
think of two things at once. Right 
now, for example, you’re busy be- 
ing indignant with me — and your 
candidate for the crown is relaxing 
on thejpb.” 

Every head but those of Ussh, 
and Relief swiveled to regard the 
figure slumped again bn the 
throne. 

“Heavens!” Magnan gasped 
from the sidelines. “You mean we 
were about to offer our credentials 
to a ventriloquist’s dummy?” 

“Not quite. He’s alive — but 
when Ussh assembled him he care- 
fully left out the more useful 
portions of the brain.” 

Suash stared uncertainly from 
his potential sovereign to Ussh, 
who stood with canted eyestalks in 
a pose of total concentration. 

“If that’s true—” 

“Nonsense, Colonel,” the Lum- 
bagan emperor-elect said firmly. 
“I repose the fullest confidence in 
Ussh, a marvelous fellow and my 
most trusted advisor. Now I think 
you’d better run along. We have 



matters of high state policy to dis- 
cuss.” 

“Don’t go,” Pouncetrifle cried. 
“Colonel Suash, I call on you in 
the name of humanity to remain 
present — there’s no telling what 
might happen in the absence of 
witnesses.” 

“I take orders from His High- 
ness, Terry.” Suash snapped. “And 
he said go. Accordingly, we’re go- 
ing.” The colonel barked a com- 
mand. His troops right-shouldered 
arms and marched away across the 
polished floor. 

“Relief — do something,” 

Pouncetrifle wailed. 

“Do what, Mr. Ambassador?” 
Ussh inquired in tones of triumph. 
“His Highness has spoken. And 
now — ” he paused until the last of 
the Lumbagan soldiers filed from 
the room and the tall doors shut be- 
hind them — “and now, with those 
trouble-makers out of earshot, on 
to the disposition of the Terran 
spies — ” He drew a power pistol 
from inside his ornate jacket. “A 
pity they should happen to be shot 
down by accident as they led an at- 
tempted assault on His Highness’ 
person, but such are the tribula- 
tions that beset those who would 
stand in the path of empire.” 

“You wouldn’t — ” Pouncetrifle 
gasped. 

“See here, Ussh,” .Ambassador 
Jith whispered. “You don’t 
actually mean to commit violence 
on the persons of the Terrans, 1 
trust? To deport them in restrain- 



106 



IF 




ing fetters, yes. But I forbid you 
to do 2 iway with them entirely.” 

“It will be our little secret, Your 
Excellency,” Ussh cut in curtly. 
“His Imperial Highness has mat- 
ters under complete control.” 

“Are you quite certain of that?” 
Jith asked, eyeing the pre- 
sumptive ruler, who now stood 
swaying slightly, gazing into the 
middle distance. “He presents the 
appearance of an unsuccessful 
lobotomy case.” 

“Why not tell him the rest of the 
secrets, Ussh?” Retief said. “Let 
him know how clever you really 
are. Describe your discovery of a 
sure-fire method for assembling 
Lumbagans to order — according 
to any genetic code desired. Tell 
him about your experiments, 
which produced some rather un- 
usual types, some of whom proved 
useful for special purposes, such 
as terrorizing the populace. 
Describe youF soldier farm and let 
him in on the secret of the lab 
where you worked out the details 
of your hostility transmitter — ” 

“Silence, spy!” Ussh shouted. 

4<|^ONT be modest,” Retief 
JLr urged. “Give the ambassa- 
dor full details on how you plan to 
manufacture a few million 
soldiers modeled after himself and 
equipped by Groac, and use them 
to set up a modest empire in this 
end of the Arm, after which you’ll 
no doubt establish branches on all 
the likely planets to raise spares for 



the army. With forced feeding you 
can produce a fully equipped 
infantryman in a little under 
three weeks, giin and all — ” 

“Ha-ha,” Ussh said. “You will 
have your little jest, eh? Gallows 
humor, I believe it’s called.” 

“You made your big mistake, of 
course, Ussh, when you let Suash 
and his boys leave,” Retief said. 
“He was your only chance to make 
it stick—” 

“So you imagine.” Ussh spun to 
face Jith. “The time has come for 
the carrying out of His Highness’ 
commands. If you would like to 
do the job personally it would be 
a gracious touch in keeping with 
the close relations existing be- 
tween Lumbaga and Groac.” 
“Wouldn’t it though?” Retief 
said. “If you could con Ambassa- 
dor Jith into committing himself 
to the murder of a covey of Terries 
he’d have no choice but to back 
your play. Fortunately, he won’t be 
so foolish — ” 

“You think not!” Ussh snarled. 
“Jith — order them shot — now!” 
“Don’t you dare, Jith!” Pounce- 
trifle yelped. “I absolutely forbid 
it—” 

“Forbid, you say?” Jith whis- 
pered. “You go too far, Har- 
vey — ” The Groaci Ambassador 
faced Ussh. “If you’re quite sure 
the Terrans planned the murder of 
His Highness, it of course be- 
comes my duty to — ” 

“To listen to the rest of the 
story,” Retief said. “There are a 



THE ALL-TOGETHER PLANET 



107 




couple things Ussh forgot to men- 
tion—” 

“Details, details!” Ussh yelled. 
“The important fact is that I, at the 
head of an army of dedicated 
troops, will lead the way to the con- 
quest of vast new territories, 
eliminating or enslaving inferior 
peoples along the way, and in the 
end organizing the entire Galaxy 
as a single Empire under a single 
rule!” 

“A glowing picture,” Retief 
said. “But of course Ambassador 
Jith has no reason to lend support 
to the scheme.” 

“Have I not, Mr. Retief?” Jith 
whispered. “I admit Swarm- 
master Ussh has employed un- 
orthodox methods — but if the end 
result is a Galactic Empire under 
Groac — ” 

“Correction, Mr. Ambassador. 
Groac will be among the first vic- 
tims.” 

“Victim? Of her own troops, un- 
der her own general Ussh? Pre- 
posterous!” 

“It’s true that Ussh and his army 
will be in position to cut quite a 
swath, with Groaci backing and 
Groaci material. And no doubt in 
the end the CDT would come to 
what’s known as an accommoda- 
tion with the de facto situation. 
But you’re forgetting an impor- 
tant datum. The troops who’ll be 
doing the conquering won’t be 
Groaci; they’ll be Lumbagans, no 
matter how many eyes they 
happen to have.” 



“Well — as to that,” Jith stalled, 
looking to Ussh for counsel. “I as- 
sume that as honorary Groaci, true 
to their exalted somatotype, we 
may rely on General Ussh to keep 
the interests of his mother-world 
in the forefront of his mind.” 



4<Tj^XACTLY,” Retief said. 

-I-^“And his mother world is 
Lumbaga.” 

“Clearly he’s taken leave of his 
senses,” Ussh grated. 

“Granted, he’s a most unusual 
Lumbagan,” Retief went on. 
“Normally, once an accretion of 
Freebies reached the Four-decker 
stage — at which point intelligence 
appears — their finer sensibilities 
prevent them from carrying 
evolution any farther. But it ap- 
pears that General Ussh broke the 
taboo.” 

“What vile allegation is this?” 
Ussh yelled. ♦ 

“Careful, Ussh, you’ll give your- 
self away,” Retief said. “It doesn’t 
seem to vile to anybody but a 
Lumbagan.” 

“This is all nonsense, of course,” 
Ambassador Jith purred. “But to- 
satisfy my curiosity — go on, Mr. 
RetielT’ 

“Ussh — or whoever the original 
Lumbagan personality was who 
had the idea — overcame his 
scruples and integrated himself 
with another individual — possibly 
a Trip; a sub-intelligent creature, 
but of course the combination has

IF 




capabilities that exceed those of 
either of the original components. 
Unfortunately, he used his en- 
hanced mental powers to concoct 
a scheme to take over Lumbaga 
first, then the rest of the material 
Universe. Naturally he needed 
help; he made a study of the 
foreigners present on his world and 
picked the Groaci as the likeliest 
partners. With his abilities, it 
wasn’t hard for him to readjust 
his external appearance to match 
yours, Mr. Ambassador — ” 

“He’s raving!” Ussh yelled. 
“How could anyone possibly — ” 

“It wasn’t easy, at first — but you 
figured it out. Some of your prac- 
tice models are still running around 
in the woods, making Groaci 
tracks to confuse the trail. But in 
the end you were able to palm 
yourself off on a few malcon- 
tents as a Groacian VHPP and en- 
list some behind-the-scenes help to 
set things up for your coup — ” 
“That, Terry, is your final 
error,” Ussh grated and aimed the 
gun at RetieFs ribs. 

“Ussh — control yourself,” Jith 
keened. “What simpler than to give 
the lie to this fantastic allegation?” 
“Is it fantastic?” Retief said. 
“Ussh, deny you’re a Lum- 
bagan — but do it in Groaci, just to 
be certain your fellow countrybe- 
ings don’t miss any of the finer 
nuances.” 

“Bah, prepare to die, witless 
Terran — ” 

“Ussh, if you expect my aid and 



support — do as he says,” Jith 
hissed. 

Ussh hesitated, then turned to 
include the Groaci delegation in 
his field of fire. 

“Think what you like, Jith. 
You’ll dp as I bid or die with the 
Terrans. I’ll explain to your suc- 
cessor how you and the Lum- 
bagans slaughtered each other, on- 
ly myself surviving — then I’ll en- 
list his support and on to em- 
pire!” 

“Why— why, RetieFs right,” 
Pouncetrifle gasped. “Jith — he 
won’t speak Groaci — because he 
can’t — at least in a way to fool you. 
He’s an imposter!” 

^Duped,” Jith wailed. “Undone 
by my credulity — faked out of 
position and into unwitting sup- 
port of a non-Groaci conquest by 
an underling — and a bogus one at 
that!” 

“Don’t feel too badly,” Retief 
said. “He only intended to use you 
Groaci to finance his first few local 
takeovers. As soon as he’d con- 
solidated his gains, Groac would 
have been quietly consolidated in- 
to his empire, with the help of a 
number of pseudo-Groaci agents 
who would have infiltrated Groac 
by then.” 

“Race on, Retief,” Ussh in- 
vited, “Familiarize these fools with 
the scope of their folly and then — ” 
Ussh whirled as the tall double 
doors burst wide. Lucael strode 
forward, his golden eyes gleaming. 

“Yes? What is it?” Ussh barked

uncertainly. “You have dis- 
patches from the field? Or — ” He 
staggered suddenly, as if struck a 
heavy blow between the eyes. 

“Treachery!” Ussh gasped— and 
Lucael stopped in his tracks, stood 
swaying. Face to face the two su- 
per-Lumbagans stood, locked in 
mortal — though invisible — con- 

flict. 

“Ussh,” JRetief called. The imi- 
tation Groaci half-turned — and in 
the momentary distraction, Lu- 
cael struck. Ussh gave a hoarse 
cry, stood dithering for a mo- 
ment . 

Like a tree struck Dy lightning, 
the false Groaci’s body shivered 
and split. For a moment there was 
a wild scramble of parts as the 
former superbeing's components 
regrouped themselves into two 
separate entities, arms and legs 
and ears scuttling for their assign- 
ed plates. In a moment two short, 
sullen individuals stood where 
Ussh had been, staring apprehen- 
sively around at their astounded 
audience. 

“Why — it’s Difnog and Gnudf, 
the Lumbagan observers!” Pounce- 
trifle gasped. 

“And apparently,” Jith whisper- 
ed, “They were more observant 
than we suspected!” 

XI 

I T WAS half an hour later. The 
Terran diplomats, freed of their 
shackles, had huddled with 



their Groaci colleagues for an im- 
promptu meeting. 

^‘Well, then,” Ambassador 
Pouncetrifle said crisply, “since 
General Ussh seems to have opted 
for a return to civilian life and His 
Highness is permanently cata- 
tonic, it appears we’re left with 
the administrative problem of set- 
ting up a pro-tem housekeeping 
government As Terran emissary, 
:I’ll reluctantly assume the chief 
role in affairs — ” 

“Hardly, My dear Harvey,” Jith 
interjected. “Inasmuch as the pres- 
ent contretemps was produced in 
part by Grecian efforts — ” 

“Pseudo-Groacian efforts, need 
I remind you!” 

“A mere quibble, Mr. Ambas- 
sador. Groac will undertake to set 
up a caretaker government, with 
the assistance of Colonel Suash 
and his native constabulary — ” 
“Gentlemen,” Retief said. 
“Aren’t you forgetting the Em- 
peror?” 

“Eh?” 

‘^What’s that?” Both plenipo- 
tentiaries turned to survey the 
Imperial figurehead, who stood 
erect now,^gazing sternly at the as- 
sembled foreigners. 

“You need not trouble your- 
selves, gentlebeings,” he said curt- 
ly. “I’ll handle the government of 
Lumbaga — to the extent that 
Lumbaga needs governing.” He 
turned, stepped up on the dais and 
seated himself on the throne. 

“Item number one,” he said im- 




pressively. “Any foreigner found 
meddling in Lumbagan affairs 
will be shipped home in a plain 
wrapper. Item number two — ” 

“If we could go back for a 
moment to item one. Your High- 
ness — 

“Make that ‘Majesty,’ Pounce- 
trifle. I’ve just assum^ Imperial 
dignities for the duration of the 
emergency.’’ 

“To be sure. Your Majesty. I’m 
certain that on reflection you’ll 
want to rescind the restriction on 
Terran participation in Lum- 
bagan national life, inasmuch as, 
as worded, it would tend to 
somewhat restrict the free play of 
diplomacy — ’’ 

“Precisely. Item number two: 
since that government governs 
best which governs least, I intend 
to provide only the best for my 
people. Accordingly, all laws 
are declared illegal, including 
this one.” 

“Hmm.” Pouncetrifle mused, 
“since His Majesty seems clearly 
to be non compos mentis^ Jith, it’s 
clear that duty requires that 
responsible authorities step in — in 
the interest of the welfare of the 
Lumbagan people. I trust you’re 
with me?” 

“Assuredly, Harvey,’’ Jith 
whispered. “I suggest we find 
quieter quarters for His Majesty; 
possibly space could be found in 
the former root cellar, while you 
and I proceed to arrange matters 
in consonance with the principle of 



the greatest good for the greatest 
number. And inasmuch as we 
Groaci breed like flies, 1 suppose 
you’ll concede the obvious 
primacy of Groaci interests.” 

“No need for dispute,” the Em- 
peror cut in decisively. “Inas- 
much as neither of you will have 
anything to say about Lumbagan 
affairs from now on.” 

“He’s raving.’’ Pouncetrifle 
stated flatly. “Jith, I call you to 
witness that His Majesty was bab- 
bling incoherently at the time I 
was forced to have him restrained. 
Retief — assist the poor fellow 
down from his chair — ” 

“Curious accoustics in this 
room,” Retief said blandly. “I 
thought for a moment your Ex- 
cellency was proposing that we lay 
hands on a foreign Chief of State.” 
“Mutiny, eh?” a Terran colonel 
barked. “Well, fortunately for 
democracy. I’m here to carry out 
the wishes of the people as inter- 
preted by regs and expressed via 
appropriate channels — ” 

He advanced on the throne. Ten 
feet from it, he found himself 
floating an inch off the floor, his 
feed paddling vigorously. A brace 
of underlings sprang to his side, 
found themselves adrift, rising 
lightly as balloons toward the ceil- 
ing. Pouncetrifle uttered a bellow 
as he floated up from the floor, 
followed by Magnan and the rest 
of the staff. Jith uttered a faint cry 
and drifted upward, attended by 
his staff.

Only Relief and Lucael re- 
mained on their feet. 

“Now that you’ve heard the de- 
tails of the new constitution,” the 
Emperor advised the levitating 
bureaucrats, “I declare the 
audience to be at an end. Don’t 
bother backing from the pres- 
ence-just disappear.” 

At his words there were a series 
of sharp plops as air imploded to 
fill the vacancies created by the 
suddenly absent dignitaries. 

“I hope you didn’t thrdw them 
completely away,” Relief said. 
“Once they get their feet on the 
ground, I have an idea they’ll take 
a realistic view of the proper role 
of diplomacy in the development 
of Lumbaga.” 

“They’re sorting themselves 
from among the tubers in the sub- 
basement,” His Majesty said. 
“And now — I declare Parliament 
dissolved — until — the next time — ” 
he slumped on the throne and 
snored. 

Relief turned quickly to face 
Lucael. 

“Well done, Luke. I was won- 
dering how long you could hold’ 
out.” 

“If anybody asks,” the super- 
Lumbagan said in a failing voice, 
“tell them — their Emperor — will 
return — whenever the situation 
demands. And now — farewell. 
Relief—” 

There was a final sharp implo- 
sion and Relief was alone in the 
throne room.

-TlSecretary Magnan said, 
“now that the excitement is over, 
one wonders if the entire affair 
weren’t merely the product of 
group hysteria.” They were sitting 
at a long plank table in the 
Imperial Feast Hall, dining some- 
what meagerly on CDT emer- 
gency banquet rations in company 
with a cosmopolitan crowd of Ter- 
rans, Groaci, and Lumbagans. 

“Frankly, I’d be tempted to dis- 
miss the incident as sheer 
delerium,” the Terran colonel put 
in, glumly spooning in caviar. “If 
it weren’t for the fact that I’ve 
suffered a virulent recurrence of 
an old potato blight — ” His ex- 
pression brightened. “Of course, 
the condition will neccessitate 
my being invalided home for a few 
months’ convalescent leave, which 
time I might spend quite profitably 
penning a memoir of recent 
events, possibly titled: The Impor- 
tance of Mass Hallucination in

“How about The Hallucinatory 
Importance of the Military in

tartly. 

“Gosh, Relief,” Gloot said as . 
the men of war and peace sparred 
verbally. “So you were really a 
Terry all along. Makes me feel 
kind of dumb to of been chum- 
ming around with the enemy. 
Lucky I changed sides.” 

“You claim there’s two kinds of 
Terries, male and female,”

Ignarp said. “Frankly, you all 
look alike to me.’’ 

“Oh, there’s a vas deferens be- 
tween us,” Retief assured his guest. 

“And I never got my ransom 
dough,” Gloot said glumly. “On 
the other hand, I found out run- 
ning things ain’t all a bowl of cher- 
ries.” 

“One taste of government was 
enough for me,” Ignarp agreed. 
“I’ll settle for good old anarchy 
any time.” 

“Umm,” Magnan smiled loftily. 
“But of course you chaps know 
nothing of the intricacies of poli- 
tics. Now — ” he indicated the head 
of the table, where Jith and 
Pouncetrifle huddled — “notice 
the resilience with which the am- 
bassadors are coming to grips with 
the new realities, or whatever they 
are, of the situation, working out 
the rather complex protocols of 
establishing formal relations with 
a nonexistent government.” 

“As long as they stick to shoot- 
ing despatches back to headquar- 
ters and putting on charades for 
visiting politicos. Okay,” Gloot 
said. “But the first time they step 
out o’ line — whammo! The Legen- 
dary Magical Emperor will be 
back on the job — and next time 
they’re liable tp wind up digging 
their way into the root cellar from 
below.” 

“I hardly think the Lumbagan in 
the street is in a position to 
criticize matters of Imperial 
policy, Mr. Gloot,” Magnan said

coolly. “I hope your association 
with Mr. Retief on his expedition 
upcountry hasn’t given you a false 
sense of involvement in matters 
over your head.” 

“You must be kidding, Terry,” 
Ignarp said. “Gloot here is 
Minister of Imaginary Affairs in 
the Lumbagan government-in- 
exile.” 

“Government in exile?” Mag- 
nan frowned. 

“The only place for a govern- 
ment to be,” Ignarp confirmed. 
“And I j\ist accepted a post with 
the Department of Education as 
Commissioner of Superstitions.” 

“You’re stamping them out?” 
Magnan queried confusedly. 

“Heck no. I’m starting new ones

in keeping with a Tine old tradition 
dating back almost twenty-four 
hours.” 

“Speaking of superstitions,” the 
colonel said behind his hand to 
Magnan, “I think we’d do well to 
initiate a few of our own devising. 
For example, a carefully tailored 
myth to the effect that Terrans can 
work miracles — like turning water 
into vintage Pepsi, for ex- 
ample — ” He broke off, staring in 
horror at the glass before him 
which rose gracefully into the air, 
its contents darkening to deep 
purplish red. The colonel followed 
it with his eyes as it took up a 
position directly over his head and 
inverted itself, discharging a 
cooling stream of effervescent 
fluid over the officer’s startled fea- 
tures. 

After the colonel had left the 
table — a departure noted by all 
present, accompanied as it was by 
a well-directed jet of liquid 
emanating apparently from thin 
air — Magnan dipped a trembling 
finger in the puddle on the table 
and tasted it. 

“Pepsi?” Retief inquired. 

“Burgundy.” Magnan choked.” 
He rose hastily. “I think I’d best 
add a number of emendations to 
my preliminary repprt,” he 
muttered, “lest it appear that I 
was so short-sighted as to doubt the 
existence of magic.” He hurried 
away. 

“I thought you fellows had gone 
out of the miracle business 



pending the next crisis,” Retief 
addressed Gloot and Ignarp as the 
two locals gripped hands across the 
table. “But since you haven’t, try 
that last one again. Only this time 
don’t spill any.” 

A moment later they raised three 
paper-thin goblets of purple wine, 
touched them together with a 
musical clink. At the far end of the 
table. Ambassador Jith caught 
the gesture, raised his glass in 
response. 

“To a new era in interplanetary 
relations,” he whispered cheer- 
fully. “To peace and plenty for al- 
most all — within reasonable lim- 
its!” 

“That reminds me,” Ignarp said, 
“The boys in GRAB are going to 
be wondering why I didn’t re- 
divide the loot along more practi- 
cal lines while I was Emperor.” 

“While you were Emperor,” 
Gloot retorted. “While 1 was 
letting you go along for the ride, 
you mean — ” 

“You big slob, I was the brains 
of the outfit!” 

“You little creep, I handled all 
the tricky parts — ” 

“Gentlemen,” Retief inter- 
jected, “We were about to propose 
a toast, remember?” 

Gloot lifted his glass. “To our 
friends, the good guys,” he said. 

“And to our enemies, the bad 
guys,” Ignarp added. 

“And to the hope,” Retief said, 
“that someday we’ll be able to tell 
which are which.” •

J OHN Smith is an unexciting 
name to possess, and there was 
of course no way for him to know 
until the end of his career that he 
would be forever famous among 
connoisseurs of murder as Nine- 
finger Jack. 

John Smith’s marriage to his 
ninth bride, Marcia Runyon, took 
place on the morning of May the 
thirty^ first. On the evening of May 
the thirty-first John Smith, having 
spent much of the afternoon point- 



115 



ing out to friends how much the 
wedding had excited Marcia and 
how much he feared the effect on 
her notoriously weak heart, en- 
tered the bathroom and, with the 
careless ease of the practiced pro- 
fessional, employed five of his 
fingers to seize Marcia’s ankles 
and jerk her legs out of the tub 
while with the other five fingers he 
gently pressed her face just below 
water level. 

So far all had proceeded in the 
conventional manner of any other 
wedding night; but the ensuing de- 
parture from ritual was such as to 
upset even John Smith’s profes- 
sional bathside manner. The mo- 
ment Marcia’s face and neck were 
submerged below water, she open- 
ed her gills. 

In his amazement John released 
his grasp upon both ends of his 
bride. Her legs descended into the 
water and her face rose above it. 
As she passed from the element 
of water to that of air, her gills 
closed and her mouth opened. 

“I suppose,” she observed, 
“that in the intimacy of a long 
marriage you would eventually 
have discovered in any case that I 
am a Venusian. It is perhaps as 
well that the knowledge came ear- 
ly, so that we may lay a solid ba- 
sis for understanding.” 

“Do you mean that you are a 
native of the planet Venus?” 

“I do,” she said. “You would 
be astonished to know how many 
of us are already among you.” 



“I’m already quite astonished,” 
said John, “to learn of one. Would 
you mind convincing me that I did 
indeed see what I thought I saw?” 

0 |BLING1NGLY Marcia low- 
ered her head beneath the 
water. Her gills opened and her 
breath bubbled merrily. “Nature, 
on our planet,” she explained 
when she emerged, “has bred as 
the dominant race our species of 
amphibian mammals, in all oth- 
er respects superficially identical 
with Homo sapiens. You’ll find it 
ail but impossible to tell us from 
humans except maybe by noticing 
those who, to avoid accidental 
opening of the gills, refuse to 
swim. Such concealment will, of 
course, be unnecessary when we 
take over complete control of 
your planet.” 

“And what do you propose to 
do with the race that already con- 
trols it?” 

“Kill most of them, I suppose,” 
said Marcia. “And might I trou- 
ble you for that towel?” 

“That,” pronounced John, with 
any handcraftsman’s abhorrence 
of mass production, “is mon- 
strous. 1 see rriy duty to my race. 
I must reveal all.” 

“1 am afraid,” Marcia observed 
as she dried herself, “that you 
will not. In the first place, no one 
will believe you. In the second 
place, I should then be forced to 
present to the authorities the 
complete dossier which I have 



116 



IF 




gathered on the cumulatively in- 
teresting deaths of your first eight 
wives, together with my direct 
evidence as to your attempt this 
evening.” 

John Smith pressed the point 
no further. “In view of this at- 
tempt,” he said, “I imagine you 
would like either a divorce or an 
annulment.” 

“No,” said Marcia. “There is 
no better cover for my activities 
than marriage to a member of the 
native race. In fact, should you so 
much as mention divorce again, I 
shall be forced to return to the 
topic of. that dossier. And now, 
if you will hand me that robe, I 
intend to do a little telephoning. 
Some of my better-placed col- 
leagues will need to know my 
new name and address.” 

As John Smith heard her ask 
thq long-distance operator for 
Washington, D.C., he realized 
that he would be forced to take 
action immediately. He did. First 
with knife, then with gun. 

Through the failure of the knife, 
John Smith learned that Venusian 
blood has extraordinary, quick- 
clotting powers and Venusian or- 
gans possess an amazingly rapid 
system of self-regeneration. And 
the bullet taught him a further 
peculiarity of the blood: that it 
dissolves lead — in fact thrives 
upon lead. 

His skill as a cook was quite 
sufficient to disguise any of the 
commoner poisons from human 



taste. The Venusian palate, how- 
ever, not only detected but rel- 
ished most of them. Marcia was 
particularly taken with his tomato 
aspic a Varsenique and insisted 
on his preparing it in quantity for 
a dinner of her friends, along with 
his sole amandine to which the 
prussic acid lent so distinctively 
intensified a flavor and aroma. 

W HILE the ^faintest murmur 
of divorce, even after a year 
of marriage, evoked from Marcia 
a frowning murmur of “Dossier 
...” the attempts at murder 
seemed merely to amuse her. 
Finally John Smith was driven to 
seek out Professor Gillingsworth 
at the State University, recognized 
as the ultimate authority (on this 
planet) on life on other planets. 

The professor found the query 
of much theoretical interest. 

“From what we are able to hy- 
pothesize of the nature of Venusi- 
an organisms,” he announced, “I 
can almost assure you of their "de- 
struction by the forced ingestion 
of the best Beluga caviar in doses 
of no less than one-half pound per 
day.” 

Three weeks of the suggested 
treatment found John Smith’s 
bank account seriously depleted 
and his wife in perfect health. 

“That dear Gilly!” she laughed 
one evening. “It was so nice of 
him to tell you how to kill me; it’s 
the first time I’ve had enough cavi- 
ar since I came to Earth. It’s so 



TOKILLA VENUSIAN 



117 




dreadfully expensive.” 

“You mean,” John demanded, 
“that Gillingsworth is — ” 

She nodded. 

“And ail that money!” John 
protested. 

America’s greatest physiologist 
took an interest in John Smith’s 
problem. “I should advise,” he 
said, “the use of crystallized car- 
bon placed directly in contact with 
the sensitive gill area.” 

“In other words, a diamond 
necklace?” John Smith asked. He 
seized a water pitcher, hurled its 
contents at the physiologist’s neck 
and watched his gills open. 

T he next day John purchased a 
lapel flower through which wa- 
ter could be squirted — an article 
he thenceforth found invaluable 
for purposes of identification. 

The use of the flower proved a 
somewhat awkward method of 
starting a conversation and often 
led the conversation into unin- 
tended paths; but it did establish 
a certain clarity in relations. 

It was after John had observed 
the opening of the gills of a lead- 
ing criminal psychiatrist that he 
realized where he might find the 
people who could really help him. 

From then on, while Marcia was 
engaged in her activities prepara- 
tory to world conquest, whenever 
he felt he was unobserved he vis- 
ited. insane asylums, announced 
that he was a free-lance feature 
writer and asked if they had any 



inmates who believed that Venu- 
sians were at large upon Earth and 
planning to take it over. 

In this manner he met many in- 
teresting and attractive people, all 
of whom wished him godspeed in 
his venture, but who pointed out 
that they would hardly be where 
they were if all of their own plans 
for killing Venusians had not mis- 
carried as hopelessly as his. 

From one of these friends, who 
had learned more than most be- 
cause his Venusian wife had made 
the error of falling in love with 
him (an error which led to her 
eventual removal from human so- 
ciety), John Smith ascertained 
that Venusians may indeed be 
harmed and even killed by many 
substances on their own planet, but 
seemingly by nothing on ours — 
though the wife had once dropped 
a hint that one thing alone on 
Earth could prove fatal to the Ve- 
nusian system. 

At last John Smith visited an 
asylum whose director announced 
that they had an inmate who 
thought he was a Venusian. 

When the director had left them, 
a squirt of the lapel flower verified 
the claimant’s identity. 

“I am a member of the Concili- 
ationist Party,” he explained, “the 
only member who has ever reached 
Earth. We believe that Earthmen 
and Venusians can live at peace as 
all men should, and I shall be glad 
to help you destroy all members 
of the opposition party.

IF 




“One substance on Earth is 
deadly poison to any Venusian. 
Since in preparing and serving the 
dish best suited to its administra- 
tion you must be careful to wear 
gloves, you should begin your 
campaign by wearing gloves at all 
meals — “ 

This mannerism Marcia seemed 
willing to tolerate for the security 
afforded her by her marriage and, 
even more particularly for the de- 
lights of John's skilled prepara- 
tion of such dishes as spaghetti 
airaglio ed dlVarsenicOy which is 
so rarely to be had in the average 
restaurant. 

Two weeks later John finally 
prepared the indicated dish. Mar- 
cia had praised the recipe, de- 
voured two helpings, expressed 
some wonder as to the possibility 
of gills in its creator, whom she 
had never met, and was just nib- 
bling at the smallest bones when, 
as the Conciliationist had foretold, 
she dropped dead. 

Intent upon accomplishing his 
objective, John had forgotten the 
dossier — nor had he even sus- 
pected that it was in the hands of 
a gilled lawyer who had instruc- 
tions to pass it on in the event of 
Marcia's death. 

Even though that death was cer- 
tified as natural, John rapidly 
found himself facing trial for mur- 
der, with seven other states vying 
for the privilege of the next chance 
at him should the trial fail to end 
in conviction. 

With no prospect in sight of a

quiet resumption of his accus- 
tomed profession, John Smith 
bared his knowledge and acquired 
his immortal nickname. The result 
was a period of intense prosperity 
among manufacturers of squirting 
lapel flowers, bringing about the 
identification and exposure of the 
gilled masqueraders. 

But inducing them, even by 
force, to eat the substance poison- 
ous to them was more difficult. 
The problem of supply and de- 
mand was an acute one, in view of 
the large number of the Venusians 
and the small proportion of mem- 
bers of the human race willing to 
perform the sacrifice made by 
John Smith. 

It wj^s that great professional 
widower and amateur chef him- 
self who solved the problem by 
proclaiming in his death cell his 
intention to bequeath his body to 
the eradication of Venusians, 
thereby pursuing after death the 
race which had ruined his career. 

All that had to be done, he 
pointed out, was secretly to slip a 
bit of human protoplasm into ran- 
dom meals — and the sheep would 
be separated, by death, from the 
goats. 

The noteworthy proportion of 
human beings who promptly fol- 
lowed his example in their wills 
has assured us of permanent pro- 
tection against future invasions, 
since so small a quantity of the 
poison is necessary in each indi- 
vidual case; after all, one finger 
sufficed for Marcia. •

“There! I told you! I told you!” 

John, the miner, was sheathed in 
folds of black scaly skin. Sweaty, 
unaccustomed muscles smart- 
ing from lengthy surface travel, he 
squinted into the haze above the 
water. 

“I don’t see anything,” he said in 
a voice suitable to his physical 
status. One large black armored 
knuckle clicked nervously. 

Quint’s verdant fur ruffled in 
the salt breeze. “Oh, you can’t see 
any- thing, cave-eyes,” he said. 

“I can, too,” said John, shading 
his enormous red eyes from the 
sun’s painful rays as much as from 
the insult. “I can see as good as 
you can. Better. Remember in 
the ruins — ” 

“Cannot,” Quint spat back. 
“Cannot! Cannot! ” 

It was the wrong time and the 
wrong place and John was in the 
wrong mood. He was hot and 
thirsty and full of muscle 
aches — even his long toes longed 
for a return to the dark moist 
earth they were used to. The harsh 
dry sand gritted under his nails. 
Fire flashed deep in his miner’s 
eyes. 

“1 can see good enough to grab 
you, you little green ape,” John 
said, his long right arm and click- 
ing mandible snaking out as if af- 
ter a diamond in the wall of one of 
his tunnels. Quint yelped and tried 
to sidestep but his agility was not 
enough. The thin black digits 
choked off his wind and then the 



fight was really on. All the others 
could see was their backs — Quint’s 
small and green, John’s large and 
black — in the center of a swirling 
tornado of sand. 

“All right! All rights Champ 
said. He waded in as he might have 
shoved his way into a torrential 
mountain stream after succu- 
lent fish in his far homeland. His 
huge meaty paws grabbed both 
combatants and held them far 
apart, one on each side of his mas- 
sive gray chest, “Enough of this 
stupidity. Enough of fighting! 
Our fathers fought sufficiently 
for all!” 

“But it’s there, I tell you.” Quint 
said, his voice becoming shrill as 
he struggled in the giant’s paw. 
Excitement and frustration 
were bringing the Monk to 
tears — but the Champ’s hands were 
bringing him and John close to 
strangulation as they struggled. 
Finally both relaxed and panted 
for breath and Champ’s grip loos- 
ened slightly. 

“I think Quint’s right,” said a 
small voice from Marv’s back. 
They all turned. “I think 1 see 
something also, way off near the 
curve of the bay.” 

Champ turned and squinted in- 
to the blue distance. “Too far for 
my poor eyes, too far. All I can see 
is sand, but if you — ” 

“I do,” said the small voice. 
“It’s white, like the sand. Blends 
in. But it’s there.” 

Champ let the fighters slide to 



ONE MOMENT ON THE SAND 



121 




the gritty sand, where both lay 
limp and panting. 

‘*See,” Quint managed to gasp, 
*‘Harold — Harold agrees with 
me ” 

Champ looked down at the pros- 
trate green monk and black miner. 
“Don’t you two flght no more,’’ he 
said seriously. “No more.’’ 

“I — I guess I can’t sec too 
good,’’ John mumbled from where 
he lay. He looked up at Champ’s 
massive figure looming above 
him. “Too good,’’ he repeated. 

Marv used his long supple tail 
to help Quint resume his seat. The 
party started off again across the 
blowing golden sand. John strug- 
gled to his feet, glanced back at the 
dark rolling mountains of home, 
then at the sea and the straggling 
party around the red dragon called 
Marv. He sighed deeply from his 
miner’s lungs and followed sul- 
lenly. 

A HALF-hour of trudging 
through heavy sand brought 
the party close enough for all to see 
the object easily. It was a boxish, 
low rectangular affair, large 
enough to contain them easily, if 
they could find a way into it and if 
it proved hollow. Maybe they 
could use it in the fall to avoid the 
purple mists. Maybe it contained 
some treasure like the cave full of 
canned peaches John had found the 
summer before. Its color was 
like the sand. As they came closer 
they could see that the object was 



pitted by the constant blowing of 
harsh crystals. Many years must 
have pas^ since its construction 
in the oldtime. 

And it was oldtime — of that they 
were all sure. 

The group of friends traveled 
mainly in silence. Champ had lit- 
tle to say at any time. He liked to 
think of himself as a doer rather 
than a thinker like Harold or a 
talker like Quint. John was too de- 
pressed to talk. He tried to think of 
dark caves and moist soil as he dug 
his sharp toes into sand time after 
time, step after tedious step. 

Quint didn’t want to pick anoth- 
er fight with the miner. He knew 
that anything he said might rub 
John the wrong way and he was 
trying to get back his wind after 
the morning’s hassle. Marv didn’t 
talk because he couldn’t — not with 
his mouth. He was not equipped 
with vocal cords. He would have 
had a lot to say, but he couldn’t say 
it and that was that. Marv was not 
one to storm at cruel fate — he 
nodded and thought his esoteric 
thoughts and kept them to himself 
as he marched patiently across 
the beach. 

Harold shivered under the thin 
blankets that shielded his frame 
from the bitter wind. He was do- 
ing his best to cling to Marv’s 
swaying back. Harold was too 
tired to talk. 

When they were only yards away 
Quint hopped (flew?) from his 
place on Marv’s back and skipped 



122 



IF 




to the crumbling structure he had 
discovered. 

“See! See!” he shouted into the 
fresh breeze and at the sea. “I told 
you! Here it is! What fun!” 

He scampered, jumped to the 
low roof and did a playful dance as 
the rest came up to the walls. 
Quint’s prancing feet set flying 
showers of fine loose dust and lit- 
tle pieces of wall. 

“Cut that out,” Champ said in 
agitation. 

Quint laughed. The giant 
reached out a hand to catch the 
Monk, but was too slow. Quint 
scampered out of reach to the far 
side of the roof. 

“Can’t catch me!” he cried. 
“Naaaa!” He laughed again. 

“Who wants to?” John mut- 
tered sullenly, but nobody lis- 
tened to him. 

Harold carefully slipped off 
Marv’s broad red back, bracing 
himself against the heavy wing 
muscles. He straightened his 
spindly legs, took a deep breath, 
then started to examine the side of 
the building near him. 

“See, Mary,” he said, fingers 
running lightly over the crum- 
bling white surface, “it’s from the 
oldtime. My daddy built this. And 
he flew, too, better ’n you. Maybe 
I can find out where he went. May- 
be I can find out where they all 
went, our folks. Maybe we can all 
go home. Come on, Marv, let’s see 
if we can find them.” Marv 
nodded, keeping his thoughts to 



himself as only Marv could, and 
folloiyed Harold. 

John looked about him. Champ 
was lumbering down'to the ocean 
to catch some flsh for lunch. 

Practical idiot, uncaring lum- 
mox . 

John wondered what had ever 
possessed him to join the group. 
Why? Why? All they ever gave him 
was spite and backtalk. He hated 
them. Then he remembered the 
long cold nights by the Tree near 
the purple glowing Pit and the 
voices — and he shivered. 

Still — he did hate them. If only 
there were someone else, some 
other human company — with a 
shake of his head to clear it of cob- 
webs of memory, John reached, 
dug his nails into the top of the 
roof and hauled himself up. Quint 
saw him and deftly flicked a peb- 
ble at him. It hit — and stung. 

“Hah!” yelled Quint in glee. 
“Can’t catch me, can’t c atch me!” 
And the little green fool hopped 
out of reach, smiling from tufted 
ear to green tufted ear, showing 
small pointy white canines. John 
idly waved his long arm, anger dy- 
ing in frustration. “Who wants 
to? Who wants to anyway? Go 
away, leave me alone.” 

“Ahhh,” said Quint in mock 
pity. “Can’t stand to be wrong, 
John? Sore loser? Awhhh.” 

“You!” John’s long fingers 
found a loose piece in the rocklike 
material of the roof. He hurled it 
at Quint, who pumped his wings

just once and skipped out of the 
way. 

“Hah-hah-hah. Poor, poor John. 
Can’t do anything right.” Quint 
dropped off the edge of the build- 
ing to find someone else to play 
with. 

“Damn idiot,” John called after 
him. 

Damn idiot, John repeated in 
his thoughts, folding his long tri- 
ple-jointed legs under him. 
Damned if I can enjoy this cruddy 
game. Fll just sit here and sulk, he 
told himself and that was what he 
did. 

((OEE,” Harold said seriously 

l^to Marv. “Look, iron.” He 
was leaning against a break in the 
building’s pale surface bn the side 
away from the burning sun. A 
I5rge rusted plate was set in the 
grainy material of the walls at 
that point and Harold was exam- 
ining the pitted surface. “It’s got 
to be iron — or steel. I wonder, 
could it be a door? Maybe some- 
body’s inside.” Harold tapped the 
door lightly and a few flakes of 
rust fell to the sand at his feet. He 
tapped a little harder, listen- 
ing — a hollow gong sound an- 
swered. That, and nothing else. 
“Maybe, Marv, maybe they all 
went through this door and left.” 

Marv nodded silently. 

Harold peered closer. “Runes,” 
he said, noticing scratches, etch- 
ings of oldtime letters in the rusty 
flaking surface. “Writing. 



American. I wish I knew how to 
read. I wonder what — ” Harold 
reached out one fragile1ight-boned 
hand and gently traced the out- 
lines of the letters — what letters 
he knew not. “I wonder what — I 
wonder what they said to each oth- 
er, Marv.” 

“Hey! Heeey!” came a voice 
that they recognized as Champ’s. 
“Heey!” It came from a few yards 
away, oyer a sand dune. 

They discovered Champ at the 
bottom of a large pit. As sand was 
still cascading about the lip — an 
obldng circle about thirty feet in 
diameter — it appeared the giant 
had been the victim of a cave-in, a 
common occurrence around old- 
time ruins. Champ had a string of 
still flopping fish around his neck. 

“Oh, hello up there,” he said as 
they peered down. “I seem to have 
gotten lunch a little sandy.” He 
shook his head. “Sandy.” 

“Are you all right?” Harold 
asked. 

“I don’t know. I guess so. I was 
walking back with lunch — and 
then I was down here. I guess there 
was a cave-in.” Indeed, there was 
even a cave — a few feet from where 
Champ was seated, a small black 
mouth gaped at them, glints from 
inside promising unexpected de- 
lights. 

“What’s in the cave?” Harold 
asked, pointing. 

“Huh? What— oh.’’ Champ 
squinted at the black mouth. 
“Yeah, looks like oldtime stuff. 



124 



IF 




Metal, Gimmicks. Things. Over 
there, too.” 

Champ pointed to a place al- 
most directly to Harold’s right. 
The boy shifted his head to look at 
a tall pillar of oldtime metal, 
pointed at the top and flared at the 
base. It reached up from below 
where Champ was seated — part of 
the base was covered by sand al- 
most up to ground level. Its coat of 
white paint had aged to match the 
yellow entombing sand. It 
looked pretty, with its metal and 
white paint and a black strip or two 
here and there. Near the bottom a 
few oldtime runes like those on the 
door, chipped and peeling, could 
still be made out. 

“I wish I could read,” Harold 
whispered to himself again. 

“Hey. HEY! Harold!” Champ’s 
voice dragged the boy back to the 
present. 

“Huh?” 

“Help. Help get me outa here. 
Now?” Champ’s sad brown eyes 
looked even sadder at the bottom 
of the pit; for once the giant found 
himself in a situation in which his 
great muscular bulk was a nega- 
tive rather than a positive factor. 

“Oh. Oh, yeah, sure. I’ll get 
John—” 

ButJohn had already come. 

“Did I hear somebody mention 
a cave?” he asked. 

Harold turned. 

“Yes. Down there. See it? Want 
to explore it and help get Champ 
out?” 



“1 don’t know if I do,” John 
said, pouting, shaking his head. 

“Aw, John — somebody has to 
help Champ out.” 

“Oh?” 

“We all gotta pull together—” 
The miner frowned sadly and 
shook his head. 

“1 can’t dp it — and certainly 
neither Marv nor Quint — ” 

“Yes,” John said -sharply. “Cer- 
tainly not Quint.” 

“Come on, John. We need you,” 
Harold pleaded. 

“Oh, all right. Just remember 
you said it.” John looked over the 
lip of the depression. God, do you 
ever need me, he thought to him- 
self. You babies couldn't get along 
without me — couldn’t survive a 
day. Thinking of a cave he’d once 
found by the yellow river, he 
nosed down and then over like an 
inchworm, first digging ahead in- 
to sand as far as he could stretch, 
then looping his body until his toe- 
nails were directly behind his 
hands. All the way down the gritty 
slope, John inched and slid and 
scraped on his thick-skinned belly. 
Soon he was slipping down the few 
last feet to Champ. 

“Good to see you, John.” 

“Good to see you, Champ.” 
John smiled, stood up right and 
brushed off his dull black skin. 
“Let’s explore — then I’ll get you 
out.” He held down a hand to the 
giant. 

“Okay.” Champ smiled back 
and came to his feet. 



ONE MOMENT ON THE SAND 



125 




H .AROLD sat down on the 
edge of the pit, swinging his 
feet. Marv couldn’t sit down any 
more than he could talk. 

“I wonder what it is,” Harold 
said, indicating the pillar. “May- 
be it’s a pen-cil.’-’ Harold had difH- 
culty with the unfamiliar word, 
which he’d picked up from a hex- 
man/story-teller over by El-A 
desert, so he said it again. “Pencil. 
Or a stove. Or a car. Oh, maybe 
it’s a car and John will find the con- 
trols and then I’ll figure out how 
to drive it, like I did the can 
opener, and weUl all go for a ride. 
Oh, I wish — ” 

“Hi, gang,” said Quint, coming 
up the slope. “What’s up?” The 
Monk was covered with sand. He 
should have been totally ex- 
hausted and ready for bed, but he 
was still eager. 

“Champ fell down in that hole,” 
Harold told him. ‘‘Now John and 
Champ are exploring a cave.” 
“Wow! Wow 0 wowowow. I’m 
going down too.” Quint scam- 
pered out of Harold’s reach, ignor- 
ing the boy’s frantic command to 
stop. He went down the sandy 
slope, using his wings to brace 
himself and slow the fall. Harold 
sighed, resigning himself to fate. 

At the bottom Quint found John 
and Champ in the cave. It was a 
small cave — large enough , only for 
the three of them and maybe one 
more. There was a lot of oldtime 
equipment .around— stools and 
rusty old chairs with broken legs 



and a large metal wall thing with 
dark dirty glass squares on it and 
little switches and buttons and all 
sorts of fun things. Both John and 
Champ were sitting on the stools 
and playing with the buttons. 
They hadn’t noticed him — he’d 
surprise them and play, too. 

Quint jumped onto a table and 
started pressing every button in 
reach with all his fingers and toes. 
“Surprise!” he chortled, laughing 
in glee. Gosh, this is fun! he 
thought, scrambling on top of a 
metal shelf and prancing on the 
pushy things he found there. His 
arms searched over his head for 
more things to play with. When 
Quint caught the looks on Champ’s 
and John’s faces he laughed even 
louder. 

“Where the hell did you come 
from?” John asked irritatedly. 

“Hey,” said Champ, “stop that! 
We’re exploring, not playing!” 

“Hahahahah!” Quint screamed, 
pressed a button. Lights went on. 
“Wow! -Hahahahah!” Rewarded, 
he pressed more. A flashing red 
light went on over John’s head. A 
shrill siren sounded. “Wow!” cried 
Quint again. This was the best 
game yet! 

John glanced about wildly. The 
little fool, he thought. You can get 
killed fooling with oldtime 
stuff— and that ape will do it yet. 

“Hahahahah!” screamed Quint. 
“Can’t catch me — ” 

Champ threw a fish at him. 

Then things happened fast: 



126 



IF 




Quint pressed another button, a 
pretty red one. John grabbed a 
metal rod, that was attached to 
something, to throw at Quint. 

That little ass! John thought, 
straining at the rod. There 
was a deep roar, like sud- 
den thunder. The rod in 
John's hands came 
dowHy not off. The rod 
came scraping down 
and John's face was 
illuminated with 
harsh white light 
from outside and 
then another 
roar swelled 
even louder 
and flames 
burst from 
the metal 

pillar . PEN-CIL, or STOVE, 
or CAR, and burned all three of 
the dancing-fighting-throwing ani- 
mals that once might have been 
men — or at least men enough to 
Tight and kill — to a crisp and then 
in an instant to fragments of those 
crisps. 

And Harold had just time to say, 
“I wonder — " and Marv had just 
time to nod before they, too, be- 
came chunks of burning meat as 
the missile roared into the twi- 
light of the beach. 

H alfway around the scarred 
body of Earth was a small vil- 
lage. It had rows of corn and barley 
outside its rough log palisade. 
Two horses, three cows and one 



calf pastured on the harsh tundra 
grass beyond the crops. Twelve 
human beings lived in this village. 

WHAT GOES UP . 

Suddenly over the head of 
Creon, the headman, the commis- 
sar, the leader, there appeared 
high in the sky a burning streak. 
Creon looked up from his toil and 
used his gnarled hand to shade his 
eyes, that he might better see. A 
divine revelation came to him. 

“God," he mumbled to himself 
in his own language. “God!" He 
turned back to the village and 
started running madly, waving 
his hands, plough forgotten in the 
dust. He shouted, “God is com- 
ing!" And the other eleven human 
beings — or reasonable fac- 
similes — turned from their work to 
look up to the heavens. The calf 
stopped chewing to look up. too. 

I SHOT AN ARROW... 

But before they could react or 
breathe out in ecstasy or say a 
word (even the calf, who normal- 
ly thought very fast and spoke even 
faster) the missile reached the 
right altitude for the two treasured 
spheres of metal that made up its 
warhead to coine together and 
WOOMP and again a mushroom 
bellflower blossomed on the 
scarred and bleeding Earth, burn- 
ing the village and the corn and 
the barley and the horses and the 
cattle and the calf and the hu- 
mans . and all that was left was 
sand blowing in the breeze off the 
sea . • 



ONE MOMENT ON THE SAND 



127 





After the Word was lost, men 
found it and gave it a name. 
They called it ''MAYBE" . 

D agger sidled along the 
stained wall, his sandaled feet 
almost silent on the grit and refuse, 
his senses alert and his weapon 
ready. 

They're along here somewhere, 
he thought, around the fringes of 
this Dead Area . 

Dagger had seen the whole tribe 
but once, a few weeks before. He 



WILLIAM ROTSLER 

and his tigers had been running 
from a raid in the Eight Thirties, 
scampering wildly through bro- 
ken walls, jumping through the 
rips and tears from level to level, 
while holding tightly to two strug- 
gling women and some sacks of 
stolen food. 

His raiders had cut through an 
ancient, fire-blackened auditori- 



128 




um, into a huge lobby. The small 
tribe had been ready for them with 
knives and slings. 

The tribe’s fighters had formed 
a ring about two small cooking 
fires on the broken floor, with the 
women inside the circle — except 
for two who had long knives and 
looked able to use them. They’d 
heard the Tigers coming for six 
levels and the knives on the far 
side were searching the darkness 
for flankers, just in case. 

They had been very pro about it. 
Dagger remembered, not at- 
tacking right off, but obviously 
ready to defend. The laughing Ti- 
gers had crashed to a halt, knives 
out in an instant, and everyone 
had stared tough at everyone else 
until Dagger’s family had edged 
past, weapons ready, and had then 
broken into a run across the lob- 
by, with the wenches wailing even 
louder. 

Rolf had slammed his brunette 
alongside the head and shut her up 
and the blonde had quieted when 
she saw how far from 831 they had 
come. Tiger country. Where they 
grow the tough ones. 

But Dagger still couldn’t forget 
the blonde he had seen in the fami- 
ly huddle with the tribe they had 
surprised. 

Damn, she was something spe- 
cial . 

Tawny and smooth, with ripe 
mounds of breasts showing 
through and around the short-laced 
vest she wore. Beaded leather skirt 



with a long knife in the belt. She 
had crouched over a crying child, 
soothing it, her dark blue eyes on 
the sudden invaders. She had 
looked ready to defend. 

Dagger couldn’t get her out of 
his mind. Hell, he didn’t need an- 
other woman; he had two already. 

But this one is special, he told 
himself. 

Was the child hers? She looked 
too young to have birthed a squal- 
ler, but maybe so. Some of those 
tribes over by Frisco and down 
around Mexicompany were big 
on young bearers. Maybe this 
tribe was from Pacifica, or even 
the Catalina sector. They were al- 
ways a crazy bunch, like the flock 
of tribes that started that zongo 
religion about the Second Com- 
ing of the Great Architect. They 
said he would come any day now. 
Zongo, the whole bunch. 

When Dagger asked, Rolf and 
Claw and Stripes said they had 
never seen the tribe before. Gary 
had wanted to go snatch a wench or 
two but the others had talked him 
out of it. They knew a tough bunch 
when they saw one. 

“Wait till four or five of these 
wenches sneak off or get sick or 
something,” Rolf had told Gary. 
*‘Then we’ll go looking for fresh 
meat.” 

Gary had looked up from his al- 
gae soup and said, “I had meat 
once, you know.” They’d all heard 
his big story, but no one stopped 
him. “I was just a cub with the 



AFTER THE END AND BEFORE THE BEGINNING 



129 




Wolves then, before I came over 
here. We found this little family, 
not even a tribe, that had barri- 
caded themselves into a whole 
floor. A floor! This whole sector 
was theirs and they'd blocked iip 
all the entrances and fused slabs 
over the breaks and burns. And 
they had cattle, man, cattle. 
Greatest bunch of zongo animals 
you ever saw! Bony backs, big 
bloated bellies and breasts swing- 
ing underneath — yeah, really!” 

Gary had waved his soup spoon 
while the others patiently waited. It 
wasn't bad hearing about meat 
animals once in a while. It sort of 
kept the dream alive that some- 
where, hidden away, was a whole 
bunch of meat critters: cattle, 
sheep, chops, maybe big fat rdasts. 

“Damnedest taste I ever had. 
We ate ourselves sick and — well — 
that was the end of the cattle. 
When we came back the whole 
damned tribe got sore at us, 
started the big fight that broke us 
up. Which is why I'm over here 
now.” 

“We know,” Claw said, scratch- 
ing a plastic wall with his metal 
hook. 

Changing the subject, Rolf said, 
“I'm thinking of a few new 
wenches. Maybe if we went down 
to six hundred or so and over to- 
ward the Arrowhead sector — there 
was some pretty fancy floors over 
there in the old days. Still have 
some tasty little wenches twisting 
their tails around there.” 



“Yeah,” the others agreed and 
they quickly fell into their favorite 
conversation: Where Might Be 
The Best Place To Find Wenches, 
Loot, Food, Adventure. 

B ut Dagger hadn't really been 
listening. He drifted from the 
group and looked down through a 
rent in the floor at the new ones 
penned up with the old ones they 
couldn't trust. 

Why were wenches always 
running away? It wasn't as if any 
other tribe was better off. Not 
really. Oh, sure, the Frisco bunch 
have some zongo pleasure ma- 
chines that still worked and the 
Mexicompany grew a lot of stuff 
besides algae on Top. He'd heard 
that one flock of zongos had found 
water running through their sub- 
sub-basement and had, hooked up 
a gadget that gave them elec- 
tricity, freeing them from the solar 
cells on Top. 

Dagger walked away from the 
ripped entrance to the girl's con- 
finement box and went to the 
place where Donna and Sherise 
were boiling clothes in a big metal 
pot. Donna looked at him with a 
certain speculation and gave him 
a slow smile, but Dagger ignored 
her. She was tired of Claw, that 
was all. He could tell. Or maybe 
she hated Claw for trading her 
once to the Panthers. Maybe she 
wanted Claw killed in a fight with 
Dagger. 

In any case. Dagger passed. 



130 



IF 




What he didn’t need was to lose a 
good friend and a Tiger just be- 
cause some dumb woman wanted 
something different. 

In the next room Demon was 
hunched over some books. “Hey,” 
Dagger said, pulling up a broken 
chair and seating himself care- 
fully. “Give me some words.” 

The skinny, long-faced young 
man looked up with a weary ex- 
pression. “I’m reading, Dag. 
Can’t you ask your silly questions 
some other time?” 

“They’re not silly questions, you 
book freak. You’re the only ace 
who can tell what I want to know. 
Well, you’re the only one I know, 
anyway. “How come the women 
keep running off?” 

“They don’t. Most of them settle 
down, don’t they?” 

“Naw, they’re always slipping 
away, going back.” 

“Those are the ones you notice. 
They go because they have a lover 
or a family or a baby back there. 
Steal the baby with the wench and 
you’d have a lot that would stay.” 
“Come on. Demon, you know 
we don’t want any zongo yelpers 
around. They’d drive us crazy.” 
Dagger was disgusted with De- 
mon for not understanding that. 
“We move faster without kids, 
man.” 

“Women, you lights-out dag- 
german, are different from 
men.” He held up a hand against 
Dagger’s grin. **Different, man. 
Notice how when we stop some- 



where the women start nest-build- 
ing? Clothes are fixed, beds made 
up out of next to nothing. Cleaned 
floors. Figuring out ways to make 
things easier, right?” 

“Yeah, but that’s what they’re 
supposed to do, isn’t it?” 

“It’s the nest-building in them, 
Dag. And to them nests mean yelp- 
ers and squallers. Suckling kids is 
real woman stuff, something we 
just don’t understand. When you 
don’t take the kids the women go 
back. When you bash in the heads 
of the ones that are birthed you kill 
something inside the wenches and 
they go away.” 

Dagger stared gloomily at an un- 
identifiably stained wall. 

“Why are they that way. 
Demon? I treat my women fine 
and I’ve had three go away.” 

“Why are you the way you are? 
They’re the way they are because 
that’s the way women are.” 

Dagger looked at Demon and 
sighed. “Why do you run with us? 
You’re the one with the education. 
You could probably get into the 
Citadel or go up to Shasta and get 
taken in there. A lot better, man. 
Three bowls a day, things that 
work, even pleasure machines, I 
heard.” 

Demon leaned back into a badly 
repaired chair and drummed his 
fingers on the book before him. 

“I was in Citadel once when I 
was a kid. My uncle was a teacher. 
He got us in. But they don’t have 
everything. They’re missing parts. 



AFTER THE END AND BEFORE THE BEGINNING

big parts. Do you know what op- 
era is?” 

Dagger shook his head. Demon 
knew all kinds of zongo things. 

“It’s singing — music and talking 
and a story. They had one opera. 
Just one. On an old tape. I didn’t 
understand the language and they 
didn’t either, but it was fantastic. 
Like finding a whole store, some- 
how untouched, with all the labels 
on everything. They had tapes. 
Picture tapes they could play on a 
few old oiachines. Sound tapes. 
They had some books. I read all 
the books till there wasn’t any 
more to read. So I left. To find 
books. And whatever else I can 
find.” 

There was a long silence. Dagger 
remembered how Demon had 
come out of the dark and fought 
Hoss. He had maimed Hoss so bad 
they had had to cut his throat and 
put him out of his misery. A good 
man lost for trying to throw a 
book on the fire. They’d almost 
exiled Demon for that but he had 
looked so zongo standing there, 
the book in one hand, with Hoss’s 
blood on it and the long knife in the 
other, stained red to the hilt. 

“We can’t afford two losses in 
one day,” Rolf had said and that 
was it. 

“I found you a book once, 
remember?” Dagger said. “A big 
one, with pictures in color. Funny 
pictures — like nothing I’d ever 
seen.” 

“It was an atlas, Dag. Pictures 



of the world as it was before they 
covered it all up.” 

“That must have been a long 
time ago.” Dagger grinned. “Hey, 
what’s this book? Is this the one 
you found last week when we came 
through that whattyacallit?” 
“Residential sector. Occupied up 
to-^oh, twenty, thirty years ago. 
People living right in rooms all 
the time, the same rooms, just like 
in Citadel.” 

“That’s sure zongo. Why live in 
the same place all the time when 
you could run around and see 
things? Living like that would kill 
me quick. I’d rather cut my own 
throat.” Dagger paused. “Is that 
what the wenches want? Settling 
down, staying in one dumb place 
till some knife pack comes and 
takes everything? That’s really 
getting the Big Zongo!” 

“Some people like it. Dagger.” 
“It ain’t for me, no damn good 
for this knife, man, no damn good 
at all.” Dagger shot a dark look at 
the two women stirring the 
clothes and then turned back to 
Demon, who was studying his 
book again. 

“What’s the book?” he asked 
again, peering around Demon. 

“It’s incredibly old, a copy of a 
copy of a copy, I think, b^ause 
they didn’t have inerts then to print 
on. The original must be a thour 
sand years old and it’s about a time 
long before that.” 

“A fairy tale, like you read us in 
Desertown?” 



132 



IF 




“I don’t know. I wish I did. It 
seems crazy, really zongo, but 1 
think it was real — once, anyway.” 
He closed the book and pointed to 
the title. “Howard Pyle’s Book of 
Pirates.” 

“What’s a pirate?” 

“He was a lot like us, I think. 
Only he sailed ships on a sea of 
water and fought other men and 
took their wenches and treasure.” 
Demon opened the book to a pic- 
ture of a golden box on a rough 
blue floor. “That’s water and that’s 
a ship. See those men? They’re 
attacking the ship.” 

“Water? That much water? 
That’s as big as a floor! Toad told 
me that when he came through 
Pacifica there were whole floors 
filled with water.” 



time, before they had 
V/to cover everything up there 
were seas. Oceans. Covered three- 
fourths of the whole Earth.” 

“How many floors deep?” Dag- 
ger asked. 

“This was before they had floors 
and levels. Everything was open 
and there were fish to eat and meat 
animals on the ground.” 

“Boy, that’s hard to believe. Just 
bare ground. I saw some in Sierra 
and in Desertown, but it was sure 
nothing much. Just rough and 
hard and dry. Floors are better.” 
Demon smiled and showed him a 
picture of two men Fighting. “It’s 
called,* Who shall be captain? 



Remember when Rolf and Turk 
fought? Like that?” 

“And that’s their tribe sitting 
and watching? Where are their 
wenches?” 

“Pirates ran in a different sort of 
tribe. They’d go out in these ships 
on the water and find other places 
to raid and bring their loot and 
wenches back to an island where 
their other loot and wenches were.” 
“Is an island like a sort of safe 
place, like Citadel or Sierra Tower 
or Shasta?” 

Demon nodded. 

“That way no one could steal 
their stuff while they were gone, 
huh? Pretty smart.” Dagger 
peered again at the picture. “They 
sure look like they know what a 
knife is for. Show me some more.” 
“Look at this one. A captain has 
captured a town and is getting 
loot from the people that live 
there.” 

“Oh, like when we took 
Desertown? And those turtles gave 
us wenches and food and anything 
we wanted just so we wouldn’t kill 
them?” He looked at the picture 
more closely. “They’re mean, all 
right. That one guy has a god- 
damn long knife.” 

“That’s a sword. It’s a very long 
dagger but specialized.. Look 
here — they’re dividing the loot.” 
“Still no wenches. What’s the 
matter with those guys? They 
zongo?” 

“No, I don’t think so. Pirates 
liked wenches all right. Hell, Dag, 



AFTER THE ENETaND BEFORE THE BEGINNING

that’s why I’m reading, to find out 
things. Now go away and let me 
read,” 

Dagger rose and stretched. 
“Pirates sound like a fine tribe. 
How many were they?” 

“I don’t know. Thousands, 
maybe.” 

“Thousands?” Dagger was 
shocked. “They must have owned 
the whole world, a bunch of long 
knives like that.” 

Demon smiled wearily. “There 
were a lot more people in those 
days. Anyway, the pirates were all 
wiped out — or they gave up — or 
settled down.” 

“Settled down? You’re faking 
me down a floor, man. No studs 
that look like them are going to 
settle down.” 

Demon shrugged and hunched 
over his book. Dagger watched 
him uncertainly and then walked 
away. 

He sat down and thought about 
a lot of things — the girl he had seen 
and pirates and the life he was lead- 
ing. It was the most undisturbed 
thinking he had ever done. Or ever 
needed to do. 

And the more he thought the 
more he remembered the girl. 

Tawny she was — and a fighter. 

He kept thinking about her until 
he couldn’t stand it any more and 
he went looking. He found the 
burned floor where the lobby fires 
had been and tracked an ashen 
footprint down two floors and a 
little west before he lost the trail. 



But he kept on hunting and then, 
unexpectedly, he found them. 

The soft low sound of a wench’s 
crooning came from a split in the 
building that went up and down 
maybe twenty floors. Dagger crept 
close to the broken edge, crawling 
silently for the last thirty feet. 

There they were, camped near 
the ripped edge of the floor just be- 
low the opposite side. Dagger lay 
watching, searching for her and 
not finding her. 

Maybe she ran away, he 
thought. 

Then there was a scurry of enter- 
ing feet and the women were 
laughing and hugging three of the 
men who had arrived with bulging 
lootsacks. 

And she came out of the room to 
the rear and took one of the sacks 
and started setting out the algae 
cakes and green tubers. 

Was the one she got the sack 
from her man? 

She had the food set out and the 
other sacks were emptied and the 
little piles redivided. The girl 
stood iip and stretched, her breasts 
tight against her vest and the flat, 
taut tawniness of her stomach 
was bared. 

Then she looked up and straight 
at him. 

Dagger froze in place. He knew 
she saw him and his muscles 
tensed for flight. 

But she wasn’t moving. 

She was just looking and alert. 
Her hand rested on her knife hilt. 



134 



IF 




Shes not afraid. Dagger said to 
himself in astonishment. 

Slowly he raised his head so that 
she could clearly see his face. He 
could still be off and running be- 
fore they could possibly get across 
that big rip in the structure. 

He saw the tenseness go out of 
her body. For a long time she just 
stood looking at him. Then she 
smiled. 

It was the smile that made Dag- 
ger go away. 

A smilel 

He trudged back through the 
floors and levels, up ruined escala- 
tors and down through cracked 
floors, along curved passages and 
. around ancient hexahedrons, along 
dim passages where even the glow- 
evers had failed. 

She smiled! 

She didn’t cry alarm. She didn’t 
run. She didn’t do anything. She 
, had checked the turf and decided 
there was only one knife — and she 
had smiled! 

Dagger went back to his tribe 
and thought. 

Then he went wench hunting. 

That was a wench he wanted. 

He tracked her group to the edge 
of a Dead Area, then across a huge 
blackened ruin where one whole 
sector had exploded, then around 
a dried-up recreational park where 
anything could hide, and down a 
tall, dusty factory row. 

He was certain they were close 
because the last Tire had still been 
warm. He sidled along a wall and 



peered through a ruined door. A 
faint sound froze him and it was a 
minute before he moved again. 

Song? Yes, it was someone sing- 
ing. 

He slipped quietly through sev- 
eral rooms of charred garbage to 
another passage. The song was 
louder and he knew exactly where 
it came from. 

As quiet as a nightcreeper he 
drifted toward a door and looked 
into the ruined garden beyond. 
This was the palace of some long 
dead prince or merchant baron. A 
cracked and empty pool was be- 
yond the screen of struggling 
greenery. The tribe had camped in 
the pool around a dry fountain. 

And she was in plain sight. 

D agger watched in motion- 
less silence until the tribal chief 
dimmed the lights and everyone 
settled down for the night. Three 
guards roamed the perimeter, but 
Dagger was used to keeping mo- 
tionless and they did not detect 
him. 

Now what? he asked himself. 
Sneaking in there could get my 
throat vented. None of my brother 
knives wanted to come with me on 
a zongo mission so I cant muscle 
my way in. 

Dagger slept fitfully for an hour, 
then crept back and found a place 
two floors up and a way north. 

77/ track *em and watch for my 
chance. 

For two days he was the ghost 



AFTER THE END AND BEFORE THE BEGINNING 



135 




behind them, to their side and 
once, even ahead of them, when he 
hunkered down in a rusty storage 
bin in a place where they might 
camp. Imperfect visions of him- 
self leaping into their midst and 
carrying her off before they 
reacted kept bothering him. 

That way Vd only have one way 
to run . 

Nothing worked or presented 
itself for exploitation until two 
days had passed. He found a water 
leak from above and cautiously 
tested it. The water was good, 
which meant he might expect them 
to use it. He climbed up one floor 
and lay close to a hacked-out hole 
made by some other hunter. 

One of the other wenches came 
first, then two of the older women, 
one with a quiet yelper. 

The squallers are very quiet with 
this tribe ... 

Then she came. Alone. 

Dagger watched her move. 
Watching her, he almost forgot 
his mission, she was so pretty and 
so graceful. She had filled the jug 
and was turning to go before he 
acted. 

He dropped through the hole. 
She was too quick for him and her 
knife was in her hand when she 
turned. There was fear in her face. 
But not panic, he thought ap- 
provingly. 

She recognized him. There was a 
moment’s wavering, then her knife 
hand was out, the blade was steady. 
But she hadn’t cried out. Dagger 



smiled at her, slowly moving 
closer. 

“I’m Dagger. My tribe is the 
Tiger tribe. I want you to be my 
woman.” 

Her eyes flicked beyond him, 
then around. 

“There’s no one else,” he said. 
“Just me. I don’t want to hurt any- 
one. I just want you.” 

“No,” she said, the point of her 
knife weaving in a menacing 
manner. “I have a man.” 

“No, you don’t.” Dagger didn’t 
know why, but he suddenly felt 
this was true. “I don’t think you 
have a man. But you want a man.” 

“Not a Tiger man. They’re 
raiders.” ^ 

“We’re pirates,” Dagger said 
proudly. 

“You kill, take — ” The knife 
point was still weaving expertly. 
Her eyes darted again and her 
muscles were tense. “You kill 
babies. You break. You do not 
build.” 

Dagger felt helpless. “We don’t 
all kill. Demon reads books. He 
saves books! He read to us about 
Mother Goose and Walden Poftd 
and the long-ago people.” He tried 
smiling again. 

“Books?” The girl was uncer- 
tain and Dagger stepped closer. 

“Yes, books. Books about life 
back then, you know, before. I’ve 
read a lot of books. About pirates, 
for instance. Did you know that 
most of the world was under water 
at one time? Ships sailed on the 



136 



IF 




water, big golden ships full of men. 
And the whole world was dirt and 
water and sky, lots of sky, with air 
and birds in it, just like the murals, 
but not like up Top. Different. I 
could teach you about books,” he 
said softly. 

“You read? You know about — ” 

Dagger knocked aside the knife 
and grabbed her. She screamed and 
he hit her on the chin. It took two 
blows before she slumped, drop- 
ping the jug, which broke, and the 
knife, which clattered. 

In an instant Dagger had 
scooped her up and was running. 
Behind him he heard a woman cry 
out, then the bull roar of several 
men shouting orders. He banged 
both her head and her feet, going 
through a place where a wall had 
fallen. He jumped a slidefall and 
raced down a passage, his heart 
thumping madly. 

Twist, turn, confuse. Labor up 
that broken stair to another floor, 
then double back overhead and 
down that ramp to end three floors 
below and heading west. Cut 
north. Lower her down an old ele- 
vator shaft, swing her limp body in- 
to a maintenance passage. Knock 
her out again when she struggles 
and carry her on your back through 
two whole sectors before collap- 
sing. 

Dagger tied her up and fell back, 
breathing hard. He listened for 
pursuit, then grinned weakly. 

OuMwisted them! 

He sprawled on the grit of the 



battered floor and looked at the 
girl. Even with bruises she was 
beautiful. He reached out and 
touched her skin. Warm and 
smooth. 

His trembling fingers unlaced 
the front of her vest and he peeled 
back the imitation leather to ex- 
pose her breasts. 

Full and firm. 

He wanted to touch but he 
couldnU bring up his hand. 

She awoke angry, afraid. She 
ignored her bared bosom and her 
tied wrists and ankles. 

“You zongo creeper-eater! You 
burned-out box! You Tiger!” 

Dagger raised his fist and started 
to hit her but her look blazed at 
him. 

“Go on. Tiger!” she taunted. 
“Knock me out again! That’s all 
you know, killing and hitting and 
stealing!” She spat at him inef- 
fectually. “You wouldn’t know a 
book if it bit you!” 

“Books don’t bite.” Suddenly 
Dagger laughed. “You think 
books bite?” 

He grinned at her and suddenly 
wasn’t angry any more. They all 
cursed him at first, but they came 
around. Except for the ones that 
ran away. 

“1 suppose you want to take me 
to that filthy tribe of zapped-out 
vandals you call a family?” 

“Why not?” Dagger’s pride was 
hurt. “They’re a damn good bunch 
of knives. Better than anyone we 
meet.” 



AFTER THE END AND BEFORE THE BEGINNING 



137 




“Sure they are — you run from 
the ones that you can’t lick!” 

Dagger forced down the angry 
venom. She didn’t really know the 
Tigers like he did. She’d change her 
mind. 

“You will learn to like them,’’ he 
said softly. 

“I don’t want to learn to like 
them!” 

Dagger looked at her through 
slitted eyes. “Could you learn to 
like me?” The question cost him 
and he wished he had not spoken. 

Knock her out and carry ner 
home . 

But she was silent. 

“Well?” he growled. 

“Perhaps. If you weren’t so 
zongo. If you bathed. And didn’t 
lie so much.” 

“Lie?” 

“Yes, lie about books. Books are 
very precious and you lie about 
them, just to catch me.” 

“I didn’t lie about the books. 
Demon has books. Demon reads 
books to all of us, whenever he 
finds them. I’ve heard a lot of 
books. Robin Hood, he was like a 
pirate, who lived in a big sector 
like garden. There was a wench 
who told stories about zongo 
things. Floors that fly. Meat ani- 
mals that fly. Princes that go out of 
citadels and run with tribes of 
knives. Oh, I have heard many 
books!” 

The girl looked at him. Her eyes 
were blue and her long hair yellow. 
Her breasts were tawny and round. 



Dagger knew now how Demon 
felt about books. 

“My name is Loree. If you read 
me books I will be your woman.” 

Dagger hesitated. Demon read 
the books, not he. “I will see to it 
that books are read to you,” he 
said grandly. 

“Then I will be your woman.” 
She paused, then shyly asked, 
“You have other women?” 

“Yes,” Dagger said. He was 
proud that he had had more than 
one almost all his life — or since he 
got his first real knife. 

“Oh,” Loree said, but her voice 
said much more. 

“Come, I will cut you free.” ‘His 
knife was in his hand but she 
stopped him with a pulling away. 

“How do you know that I won’t 
run?” 

He grinned. “If you did not lie 
you will not run. If you lie and run, 
I chase and catch and will not trust 
you again. But if you do not run it 
will be easier.” 

The girl made a sound which he 
could not easily understand, then 
moved her wrists around to be cut 
free. Two slashes and she could 
stand. She did not run. 

Dagger grinned again and 
sheathed his knife. “Come,” he 
said, starting out, “1 will read you 
books.” 

How he would do so he did not 
know. But he would find out. 

His life had changed. Dagger 
thought, but just how, he was not 
sure. •

IF 





I F THERE are any readers of 
science fiction who don’t also 
read other forms of fiction and 
considerable non-fiction, I shall be 
happy not to make their acquaint- 
ance. True, there is a kind of man 
whose mind is so narrow that a fly 
standing on his nose can paw out 
one eye while kicking out the other. 
But in our field, I like to believe, a 
man can be a true fan without 
being a fanatic. 

For myself. I’ll choose to read 
anything that gives me genuine 
pleasure or illuminates the uni- 
verse of man and of nature. Dur- 
ing the past year, while reading as- 
sorted science fiction, I also had 
the pleasure of exploring books I 
hadn’t previously read by such 
authors as Eric Ambler, Nevil 
Shute, Thornton Wilder, Carl 



Jung, Hermann Hesse and James 
Cabell. I should also add the 
name of one woman — Georgette 
Heyer — whose excellent crafts- 
manship and consistency make a 
form of story I usually dislike a 
joy to read. Without such “out- 
side” reading. I’d soon lose per- 
spective, since our science-fiction 
literature may be judged good or 
bad only by the standards that 
apply to all literature. 

At its best, of course, science 
fiction can add another dimension 
to writing. It can go outside cus- 
tomary bounds to widen the range 
of human experience, broaden 
man’s challenge to his own limits. 
(Fantasy can also do that, but too 
often at the expense of ration- 
ality.) As a consequence, the best 
writers of science fiction have de- 



139 




veloped'a flexibility of outlook, 
together with a joy in a deeper 
look, often lacking in most other 
fiction. 

For example, there is STUR- 
GEON Is Alive and Well . ., by 
Theodore Sturgeon (Putnam, 
$4.95). 

The message of the title is a 
heartening one, but there is noth- 
ing else on the jacket to say that 
the volume is science fiction. In- 
deed, as Sturgeon points out in his 
Foreward, many of the stories are 
not sf in nature at all. At least half 
of them certainly are not. Fine. 
They have the feel of science fic- 
tion— the good part of that strange 
tingle up the backbone that usu- 
ally goes only with a first-class sf 
story. They have an inside-out in- 
sight that simply doesn’t come out 
of the normal mainstream. And 
there is also the iceberg quali- 
ty — most of the thought given to 
them is below the surface where it 
only affects you after you are hit 
by his points. 

With a single exception, these 
are all new Sturgeon stories, on- 
ly one of which appeared in a sf 
magazine. The 1954 exception is 
To Here and the Easel, originally 
from a softcover anthology. The 
story may be fantasy or it may be 
a sort of allegory, but it defin- 
itely is the most readable outcry 
from the darkness of creativity 
I’ve ever seen. Outwardly it deals 
with a man caught between our re- 
ality and the world of Orlando 



Furioso, Inwardly, it may tell 
you why Sturgeon — and many 
other writers — sometimes van- 
ishes for a time. I’ve always loved 
the story, but I’m biased by expe- 
rience. 

Slow Sculpture appeared in Gal- 
axy and won this year’s Nebula 
award as the best story of its 
length. The award was earned, too. 
There are ten other stories, each 
somehow unique. One deals with 
Nothing at all — literally, and in 
capitalized form. My favorite is 
Brownshoes, a quietly intense 
short story; in my opinion, this is 
the final summation of what 
Sturgeon has been patiently 
learning about human love for a 
quarter century of his writing ca- 
reer. The closest to convention- 
al — and to me, least effective — is 
Jorry*s Gap; and eVen that story is 
one I’m glad I read. 

Sturgeon is not only alive — he’s 
very well indeed. After reading 
the book, I feel much better, too! 
It’s not all science fiction, but it is 
all highly recommended. 

S TURGEON’S stories are 
mostly what I call visions: 
that is, they are essentially stories 
of man’s achievements, of his 
hopes and of his possibilities. But 
if you insist on reading night- 
mares, you can satisfy your ap- 
petite with some rather beautiful- 
ly dark ones in Alone Against To- 
morrow, by Harlan Ellison 
(Macmillan, $6.95). 



140 



IF 




I find this the best collection of 
Ellison’s work, that has been pub- 
lished. Apparently the author 
agrees, since he lets the stories 
speak for themselves, rather than 
telling us about them in lengthy 
prologues. Aside from a very brief 
introduction, they appear with- 
out blurbs — and they need none, 
since some of them are already 
classics. 

Several of them are award-win- 
ning stories, with either a Hugo or 
Nebula to their credit. But of more 
importance, they are consis- 
tently stories with unified and 
strong emotional impact. 

I don’t normally care for a cat- 
alog of the many short stories in a 
book, but the important ones are 
here: / Have No Mouth, and I 
Must Scream: Repent, Hark- 

quin!** Said the Ticktockman; and 
eighteen others. If you like Elli- 
son’s work, you’ll surely find your 
favorite here. (My own happens to 
be O Ye of Little Faith but may- 
be that’s because I was around at 
the beginning of the story. Harlan 
Ellison let me auction him off to 
the highest bidder, promising to 
write a short story using any three 
words the bidder supplied; he then 
sat down in the middle of the 
crowd and proceeded to write — 
and surprised me by writing a 
darned good story that way.) If 
you haven’t liked Ellison, some of 
these stories may change your 
mind. 

By and large, I find many char- 



acteristics of these stories are 
those which often irritate me. 
They use science and all of our at- 
titudes toward the scientific 
method as rainwear, to be dis- 
carded when not necessary or put 
on whenever the flood comes. Al- 
so, they often seem to assume 
that some current attitude or so- 
cial insanity is of ever-enduring 
importance. 

Yet a strange consistency is ap- 
parent here. When his use of either 
science or of current attitudes is 
considered against the total effect 
of the man’s writings, it becomes 
evident that neither is the real nug- 
get. Ellison is concerned with 
man’s reaction to science; and 
with current insanities as dis- 
gressions from the main route of 
man’s evolution toward — hope-- 
fully — a degree of rationality. 

In a highly individual fashion, 
these stories wed the mainstream 
of our literature to science fiction. 
They deviate a long way from stan- 
dard science fiction. But unlike 
the science fiction nightmares of 
some mainstream writers who 
have tried our field, they have 
consistency, they create their own 
worlds and they are worked out 
rigidly from theory to test. I rec- 
ommend the book, particularly 
as a necessary balance to the too- 
easy visions that are more com-

Starlight, by Hal Clement

written — that rare and difficult 
form known as hard-science fic- 
tion. The situation, the back- 
ground and the most important 
characters are all ones that could 
not be put into any other type of 
story — and they all derive from a 
carefully detailed examination 
of scientific possibilities. 

This is the long-awaited sequel 
to Mission of Gravity, which I 
consider the best novel of its type 
ever written. The creatures from 
the former novel, capable of 
standing up to six hundred times 
our gravity, are enlisted by Earth 
to explore a strange new planet 
called Dhrawn, which may be eith- 
er a planet that grew too large or a 
star that didn’t quite make it. One 
exploring party is und^f Don- 
dragmer and the whole is com- 
manded by Barlennan, both 
characters from the former book. 
Above them, but unable to get 
down into the forty gravities of 
Dhrawn, is a group of humans. 

The exploring party gets into 
serious and unexpected trouble, 
due to the strange nature of the 
planet with its unknown seasons 
and its unstable mixture of wa- 
ter and ammonia in the atmo- 
sphere. And the humans stew and 
try to help, while Barlennan seems 
to be carrying on some kind of 
undercover operation of his own 
to blackmail Earth into giving 
him some advantages. 

The novel is good and manages 
to be suspenseful. If it were other 



than a follow-up to a genuinely 
outstanding novel, I might be 
very well pleased with it. But it 
lacks both the fascination in de- 
tail and the fully developed inter- 
est in the characters that it should 
have. 

Partly the trouble lies here in the 
fact that Dhrawn presents only one 
major oddity to us; once we be- 
gin to accept the oddity of its 
atmosphere and the behavior of 
freezing and thawing, little else 
develops. It remains too much the 
same. There are hints that Dhrawn 
is so radioactive in spots that its 
temperature varies from ultra- 
cold to super-hot and that the 
world lies between stellar and 
planetary in nature. But little is 
ever made of this. 

Mostly the story loses its im- 
pact because the aliens are too 
much old friends. We already 
know them. Barlennan’s plans re- 
mind us of similar ones in the pre- 
vious book, however much his 
methods vary. 

The humans are so far out of the 
scene of action that the space al- 
lotted to them in the story seems 
far too great. Benj, the young man 
on the orbiting observatory, 
seems to fill far more space than 
necessary; and he’s a little too 
good — in behavior and in finding 
ideas — to make a very interest- 
ing character. 

It’s a good book, but it’s greatly 
overshadowed by its predecessor. 
The science in it is excellently 



142 



IF 




worked out and convincing. But I 
wish more of Clement’s thoughts 
on the world of Dhrawn had been 
put to use in varying things on the 
planet. The behavior of water and 
ammonia mixtures is inter- 
esting, but even that amount of sci- 
ence can’t sustain a novel well. 

F ew novels should be consid- 
ered for pure scientific know- 
ledge, of course. Fiction should en- 
tertain. Facts are better presented 
in non-fiction works and a few 
factual books are both fascinating 
in themselves and conducive to 
deeper pleasure in fiction involving 
backgrounds from honest science. 

Donald H. Menzel has been a 
recognized name in science fiction 
for decades. He has written fiction 
and articles for magazines and has 
done art work which has bright- 
ened our covers, though he refers 
to his imaginary Martian crea- 
tures as “doodles.” He is also a 
highly regarded scientist, having 
been Director of the Harvard Uni- 
versity Observatory for fourteen 
years. 

Now he has done a beautiful and 
highly informative book on his sub- 
ject: Astronomy (Random House, 
$17.50). This volume covers just 
about everything in the light of 
current knowledge, with an excel- 
lent look at the past and the evo- 
lution of the science. It is highly 
readable, easy to follow — and it 
has some of the best illustrations 
and the most useful sky maps I 



have seen. If you want a reference 
book on this subject that can be 
read for pleasure, I can think of 
none better. 

If you are interested in the Moon 
you’ll find a great bargain in Lu- 
nar Atlas y edited by Dinsmore Al- 
ter (Dover Publications, $5.00). 
The book and the photographs are 
large, easy to study and the text is 
remarkably complete. It appears 
in soft covers, has the ruggedness 
typical of the Dover books and is 
easily worth twice the price. 

Finally, The Atlas of the Uni- 
versey by Patrick Moore (Rand 
McNally, $35.00) is a huge book 
and one that cannot be described 
adequately. If the price is too 
steep, ask for it at your local li- 
brary and be prepared to spend 
several hours staring at some mar- 
velous pictures, superb diagrams 
and excellent text. 

All three of these books are 
done with a love of the universe we 
know — and of man’s ability to 
know. A few years ago I might 
have called them science fiction — 
today they’re fact. 

Things have changed elsewhere 
in our culture, judging by another 
large and handsome book: The 
PulpSy compiled and edited by 
Tony Goodstone (Chelsea House, 
$15.00). Color reproductions of 
a hundred covers from the old 
pulp magazines include a full 
dozen from the science-fiction 
field. There are also reproduc- 
tions of the original illustrations

with the stories. Fifty stories are in- 
cluded — but here, science fiction 
doesn’t come off as well, is repre- 
sented only by two: Wanderer of 
Infinity, by Harl Vincent; and 
Parasite Planet, by Stanley G. 
Weinbaum. The weird and super- 
natural account for ten stories, 
two from Lovecraft and one from 
(ah, prestige) Tennessee Williams. 

There is some introductory mat- 
ter and a final summary on the 
super-hero characters, such as The 
Shadow and Doc Savage. But 
mostly the stories are allowed to 
speak for themselves. They do so 
very well and I think that general- 
ly the sampling is a fair one. 

Sic transit gloria, Ks hard to re- 
member that about the time 1 be- 
gan to write, a magazine stand was 
a gate to a land of eternal enchant- 
ment. With a dollar bill I could 
buy half a dozen magazines, each 
containing more words than most 
full-length books today and each 
filled with its own brand of excite- 
ment and adventure. I may not 
have learned about the plight of the 
poor — 1 didn’t need to, since I’d 
rubbed elbows with it: the De- 
pression was just over then. But 1 
learned to trek through the jun- 
gles of Sumatra, draw my sixgun, 
fight off werewolves, pitch the 
final winning strike and cross the 
deserts of Mars. 

Somehow, much as I may ad- 
mire the revered classics of ac- 
cepted literature, I cannot but 
feel that the unreal pulps taught 



me more about life and gave me a 
better preparation to live it than I 
ever got from Henry Esmond or 
Genji or even the Russians of 
Chekov — and sometimes gave me 
a lot more fun. 

Maybe it’s all nostalgia, this love 
for what we had back then. But 
maybe not. Take a good look, 
read the stories and make up your 
own mind. Science fiction may be 
the only literature that retains 
any of it today, but the world was 
once full of the sense of wonder. 
It’s still there in The Pulps. 

And since I’m deliberately not 
reviewing only science fiction this 
time, I have an excuse to bring up 
another book. There’s no good 
reason to mention it here, except 
that it’s a very good story, done 
excellently, and I think it should 
be recommended. 

The Children of Llyr, by 
Evangeline Walton (Ballantine, 
95^), is fantasy. Some time ago 
Ballantine used the author’s The 
Island of the Mighty in the Adult 
Fantasy Series and she was so sur- 
prised to see her work in print 
again that she wrote diffidently to 
the publisher, saying she had 
unpublished novels laid against 
the same background. This is one 
of those. It is based upon the 
Welsh mythic literature and fea- 
tures the demigods of those myths. 

If she had put her story on some 
alien planet or alternate world and 
given the heroes powers vaguely 
explained by pseudo-scientific 



144 



IF 




words, it would probably be con- 
sidered fresh and excellent 
science fiction. The world of the 
Welsh myths is just as strange as 
any world of swashbuckling sci- 
ence fiction. And the amount of 
thinking she must have done to 
complete her background and her 
devices would be quite adequate 
for any work of science fiction. 

But the book has a reality of its 
own. Magic works — sometimes, 
and more or less. The men in the 
story are both larger than life and 
somewhat less than modern men. 
But they stop being myth figures 
and become fully realized as hu- 
man beings. 

Their world has a balance and 
a Justice unusual in fantasy. This 
is the way it would have been if 
the old beliefs could have been 
true at all. 

The book must have been 
written about the time I was buy- 
ing all the pulp magazines almost 



forty years ago. It could just as well 
have been written last year, since 
it is thoroughly modern in its 
style and its handling of charac- 
ters. It is, in fact, timeless in the 
sense that the very best telling of 
tales is always beyond the limits 
of any given time and place. It’s a 
first-rate book. 

And as such, it deserves to be 
read. As I tried to indicate at the 
beginning of this review, there is 
a special joy to science fic- 
tion — but there is also a special 
joy to any good example of litera- 
ture. And the reader who broad- 
ens his interest may well return to 
our particular field with a fresh 
zest and insight to what science 
fiction offers. 

Which reminds me — I’ve still 
got to finish page 3 of Finnegan's 
Wake before I start the next 
review ... •

DEATH 
COMES 
TO THE 
MEGAFAUNA 



W HITE men who first invaded 
North America were as- 
tounded by the abundance of 
animal life — plains black with mil- 
lions of bison, deer, wapiti, and 
progbuck; skies dark with pass- 
enger pigeons and other fowl. 
It never occurred to them that 
this was but a remnant of the 
fauna that had roamed the contin- 
ent fifty or a hundred thousand 
years before. The total number of 
animals may have been much the 
same, but the number of differ- 
ent kinds of animals had drastic- 
ally shrunk. 

In the late Pleistocene Period, 
besides species very much like 
those of the present day, the con- 
tinent supported a swarm of other 
animals that have since disap- 
peared. In the Northeast, the 
woodlands harbored the deer- 
moose Cervalces, a tapir, and a 
beaver the size of a bear. The plains 
swarmed not only with bison larger 
than those of today, but also with 
horses and camels. 

Across the warmer parts of the 
country wandered herds of giant 
peccaries and animals of two 
kinds of South American origin: 
ground sloths, vaguely bearlike in 
outline but larger than any bear, 
with massive tails and hooked 
claws to pull down small trees to 
eat; and armadillolike glypto- 
donts with solid shells, as big as 
automobiles. 

Most impressive were the pro- 
boscidians: three genera of mam- 



moths and a mastodon. In the 
north — Canada and Alaska — dwelt 
the northern mammoth, of the 
genus MammonteuSy resem- 
bling the mammoth depicted by 
Cro-Magnons on the walls of 
French caves: an animal about the 
size of today’s Indian elephant but 
shorter in the body. It was ex- 
tremely hairy, with a sloping back 
rising to two distinctive peaks over 
the shoulders and the head. These 
domes were probably reservoirs of 
fat. It had spirally twisted tusks 
which, in old ‘males, crossed at the 
tips. Scientists have long wondered 
about these crossed tusks, since 
they would be of little use as weap- 
ons. A plausible theory is that they 
were used as snow shovels to get at 
buried food in winter. 

Across the warmer parts of the 
land roamed the southern mam- 
moth, Archidiskodon. This was a 
much larger animal, probably al- 
most hairless like modern ele- 
phants. In the intermediate re- 
gions dwelt elephants of another 
genus, ParelephaSy short in the 
body but long in the legs, with 
spirally twisted tusks like 
Mammonteus. There is no gen- 
erally accepted common name 
for all the elephants of this genus, 
so I have proposed calling them 
favonian mammoths, from the 
Latin word for “temperate.” 

The southern mammoth and the 
favonian mammoth were the 
tallest of all known pro- 
boscideans, reaching a shoulder 



148 



IF 




height of over 13 feet. The tallest 
found so far is a favonian mam- 
moth from Germany that touches 
14 feet. But the southern mam- 
moth was so close in height, be- 
sides being a more massive ani- 
mal, that we cannot call either the 
“larger” without qualification. A 
modern African elephant in the 
National Museum in Washington 
stands 13 feet 2 inches; this is ex- 
ceptional for this species but shows 
what can happen. 

A fourth proboscidean, the 
American mastodon, roamed the 
continent, its range overlapping 
those of the other three. Although 
more primitive than the others in 
jaw and tooth structure, this ani- 
mal was of good size, about as tall 
as the woolly mammoth but 
longer in body and bulkier. 



P REYING upon these animals 
were carnivores of all sizes, 
from bears bigger than the Kodiak 
grizzlies down to weasels. The 
sabertoothed cat Smilodon preyed 
on huge herbivores like the ground 
sloths, since its fangs could pierce 
even their thick hides. Even larger 
was a lionlike true cat, related to 
today's jaguar and of a similar- 
ly heavy build. There was an over- 
sized wolf, Canis dints; and to 
clean up any remains a condor, 
Teratornis, bigger than either the 
Californian or the Andean condors 
of today. 

The other continents displayed 



similar assortments of huge ani- 
mals, or megafaunas. Europe had 
Mammonteus, Parelephas, Archi- 
diskodon, and a fourth genus, 
Hesperoloxodon. This was anoth- 
er huge elephant with long, nearly 
straight tusks. There were at least 
two species of rhinoceros — the 
woolly rhinoceros, a hairy cousin 
of today’s African white rhino, in 
the North; and the more conven- 
tional Merck’s rhinoceros in the 
South. The warmer areas and 
periods hosted a hippopotamus 
like today’s species. The huge Irish 
deer bore the largest antlers of the 
whole deer family. 

The story was the same in Asia. 
Northern Asia swarmed with 
mammoths, reindeer, and a huge 
hairy rhinoceros, Elasmotherium, 
with a single horn growing from 
its forehead like the legendary 
unicorn. South of the Himalayas 
lived proboscideans of several 
kinds, including Stegodon ganesa 
with the most massive tusks of the 
order. 

In South America dwelt ground 
sloths as big as small elephants; 
armored glyptodonts; hippopot- 
amuslike toxodonts; camel-like 
macrauchenids with flexible snouts 
like miniature elephant’s trunks; 
horses and mastodons from North 
America; and others. Even Aus- 
tralia had a megafauna, with 
kangaroos ten feet tall, wombats 
the size of a rhinoceros, and a mon- 
itor similar to today’s Komodo 
dragon but 30 feet long. 



DEATH COMES TO THE MEGAFAUNA 



149 




A few score of thousands of 
years later — a mere tick of the 
geological clock — all these mega- 
faunas had vanished. They left 
mere remnants everywhere save 
in Africa and southern Asia, 
where several megafaunal types 
survived: two species of elephant, 
five of rhinoceros, one of hip- 
popotamus and assorted giraf- 
fes, buffaloes, ostriches, zebras, 
antelopes and so on, with large 
canids and felids to prey upon 
them. Even in Africa, where the 
megafauna survived best, much 
of it still disappeared: an an- 
tlered giraffe, a sheep the size of a 
buffalo and a pig the size of a 
rhinoceros among others. 

The Great Death at the end of 
the Pleistocene was not, -of course, 
the only such wave of extinction. 
There have been several. Two of 
these — those of the Pleistocene 
and the Cretaceous — are much 
better known than the rest be- 
cause the lines that then became 
extinct included such large and 
striking creatures. 

The Great Death at the end of 
the Cretaceous saw the end of 
both orders of dinosaurs, of the 
pterosaurs or flying reptiles, and 
of the aquatic reptiles called 
plesiosaurs and mosasaurs. Sev- 
eral groups of invertebrates van- 
ished at the same time. Among the 
cephalopods, which include the 
modern squids and octopi, the 
ammonites disappeared utterly, 
while the belemnites were re- 



duced to a small remnant. An- 
other group to vanish comprised , 
the bivalve mollusks called 
Rudista. About a quarter of all the 
known animal families disap- 
peared at this time. 

At the end of the Permian Per- 
iod occurred an even more drastic 
extinction, which wiped out about 
half of all the known animal fam- 
ilies. This included three-quarters 
of the families of amphibians and 
four-fifths of those of the reptiles. 
We hear less about this Great 
Death because the animals that 
perished were less spectacular 
than mammoths or dinosaurs. 
The largest land beasts of the time 
were stout, plant-eating reptiles 
of vaguely lizardlike shape, 
waddling about on pillarlike legs 
and weighing as much as a cow. 
The many kinds of smaller reptiles 
were more like our idea of a lizard. 
In the sea, the armored fishes call- 
ed placoderms, the trilobites 
(which looked like oversized 
woodlice), the eurypterids or sea 
scorpions (large insectlike 
crustaceans), and the crinoids or 
sea lilies (starfish cousins on 
stalks) all vanished. 

A similar wave took place at the 
end of the Cambrian. The Cam- 
brian is the first period for which 
abundant fossil remains have 
been found. This fact gives an- 
tievolutionists an excuse to claim 
that there must have been a sud- 
den divine Creation at the begin- 
ning of the Cambrian. Actually, a 



150 



IF 




number of pre-Cambrian fossils 
are known, consisting of sponges, 
worm burrows, sea pens and jelly- 
fish. Since most pre-Cambrian 
animals were little soft-bodied 
things without bones or shells, 
their remains are scarce. 

In the Cambrian, vertebrates 
had not yet evolved, so there were 
no very spectacular creatures to 
perish. Nonetheless, about forty 
out of sixty families of trilobites 
went under at that time. There 
were also lesser extinctions at the 
ends of the Ordovician, Devon- 
ian, Triassic, and Pliocene periods. 



T he Great Deaths pose one of 
the knottiest problems in sci- 
ence. Such worldwide phenomena, 
occurring every fifty to a hun- 
dred million years, would seem to 
call for some uniform cause. But 
none of the explanations pro- 
posed seems to work when applied 
to more than one or two extinc- 
tions. 

Animals and plants are always 
dying out and being replaced by 
others: At least a hundred species 
have perished in the last century 
and many more are in a precar- 
ious state. 

The causes of the recent extinc- 
tions are, however, obvious. The 
culprits are the hunter with his gun 
and traps, the stockman with his 
flocks and herds and the farmer 
with his plow and pesticides. They 
kill off wild animals — sometimes 



for gain, sometimes to protect 
their crops and livestock and 
sometimes for the fun of killing. 
They also convert the wild ani- 
mals’ land to human uses. The in- 
discriminate dosing of the North 
American continent with DDT 
has caused a population crash in 
the duck hawk (or peregrine fal- 
con) and the brown pelican. 

A couple of years ago a Russian 
professor wrote the New York 
Times boasting of the enlighten- 
ed conservationist policies of the 
Soviet Union. At the same time, 
the Communistic USSR had 
joined the capitalistic Japan and 
Norway to keep up the annual 
kill quotas of whales. As a result, 
two of the largest species, the 
humpback and the blue whale, 
have been brought to the verge of 
extinction. A commissar with a 
quota to fill can evidently be quite 
as ruthlessly self-interested as 
the greediest capitalist. All over 
the world, the dismal story is the 
same. 

One school of thought holds that 
the main cause of the Pleistocene 
extinction was the spread of hunt- 
ing bands of Homo sapiens over 
the earth from its African home- 
land. Professor Paul S. Martin of 
the University of Arizona is a 
leader of this faction. Others ob- 
ject that this explanation does not 
account for the Great Death. 
How, they ask, could the stone-age 
primitives who invaded the 
Americas from Asia, 12,000 or 



DEATH COMES TO THE MEGAFAUNA 



151 




more years ago, have extermina- 
ted six or seven genera of form- 
idable proboscideans, while the 
iron-age inhabitants of India and 
Africa, technically far more 
advanced, have failed to wipe out 
the two surviving species? 

Scientists" of Professor Martin’s 
school retort that, since man 
evolved from an apelike primate 
in Africa, the African animals had 
a chance to get used to him, to de- 
velope defensive instincts and to 
become wary and hostile. Then, 
when man spread to the other con- 
tinents, he found them full of 
beasts that, never having seen or 
smelled a man, were comparative- 
ly tame — as Darwin found the 
birds on the Galapagos Is- 
lands — and so were easily slaught- 
ered. 

The other side replies: the same 
rules apply to hunting man as to 
other predators. If a predator too 
severely depletes its prey, it in 
turn is reduced by starvation and 
the prey gets a chance to recover. 

The “overskill” party replies: 
When man switched to a partly 
vegetable diet, he could survive 
the loss of his animal prey, which 
he killed off to the last mammoth. 
On the other hand, the African 
megafauna survived because 
man, by changing over to a large- 
ly vegetable diet, left the animals 
comparatively unmolested. But 
these arguments contradict each 
other. Vegetarianism could hard- 
ly have simultaneously saved the 



megafauna in Africa and ex- 
terminated it elsewhere. 

Furthermore, the Pleistocene ex- 
tinction resembles the Creta- 
ceous and Permian extinctions. 
Obviously, the latter two Great 
Deaths could not have been 
wrought by men, for there were no 
human beings on Earth at those 
times. Man — Alley Oop to the con- 
trary notwithstanding — only 

arose between 65,000,000 and 
70,000,000 years after the death of 
the last dinosaur. 

T he causes of some extinc- 
tions, even before there were 
men, are plain. For the first half 
of the Age of Mammals, South 
America was isolated. The preda- 
tors of that continent were: first, 
large flightless birds (the largest 
eight feet tall) and, second, carn- 
ivorous marsupials. By parallel 
evolution, the latter developed 
into animals superficially like 
the weasels, badgers, dogs, bears 
and cats (including a marsupial 
sabertooth) of other continents. 

Then the Isthmus of Panama 
rose above the waters. The placen- 
tal carnivores — the ancestors of 
today’s jaguar, puma, ocelot, bush 
dog, kinkajou and the 
rest— swarmed across this land 
bridge. The flightless birds of prey 
and the carnivorous marsupials, 
unable to compete with the more 
efficient invaders, all died out. 

Aside from such understand- 
able exceptions, however, no 



152 



IF 




obvious causes for worldwide 
waves of extinction are known. 
When a species disappears be- 
cause it has evolved into another 
species, its descendants live on. 
When a species becomes extinct 
because it cannot compete with 
some other species, the victor in the 
contest lives on. 

In the Great Deaths, however, 
there were no victors. Whole 
orders perished without leaving 
survivors or descendants or com- 
petitors. After the Cretaceous ex- 
tinction, the earth was almost 
barren of large animals for mil- 
lions of years, until the little mam- 
mals, represented by creatures 
somewhat like today’s shrews, 
mice and opossums, expanded into 
the ecological niches that the dino- 
saurs had vacated. 

So far no logical way has been 
found to connect the known causes 
of the extinction of single species 
with these worldwide cat- 
astrophes. And it is asking too 
much of coincidence, that scores 
of genera, dozens of families and 
whole orders should perish at once 
by sheer happenstance. 

Paleontologists have racked 
their brains over this question for 
a century but they cannot be said 
to have found the answer. Of the 
single causes proposed for the 
three main extinctions, some can 
be quickly disposed of. When 
paleontology was a new science at 
the beginning of the nineteenth 
century, the great Georges Cuvier

pronounced that Earth had been 
shaken by a series of catastrophes. 
It wobbled on its axis, causing 
oceans to splash out of their beds 
and drown the animals of entire 
continents, while fish and other 
water creatures, left flopping on 
the sea's bare bottom, perished 
for lack of water. Then the oceans 
settled back into their basins, while 
the devastated continents filled 
up with immigrants from land 
that had been spared. 

Cuvier's Catastrophism seemed 
reasonable when only a few

geological periods were known, 
with wide gaps between them. As 
geological knowledge advanced, 
it transpired that the building up 
and tearing down of the rocks and 
the evolution of life had been con- 
tinuous, without Cuvierian 
catastrophes. (Cuvierian ideas, 
however, still survive in pseudo- 
scientific cults like the cometary- 
collision hypothesis put forth by 
Count Carli in the eighteenth cen- 
tury, Ignatius Donnelly in the 
nineteenth and Immanual 
Velikovsky in the twentieth.) True, 



there had been great changes: 
glacial periods, advances and re- 
treats of shallow inland seas, and 
the slow horizontal movement of 
the continents about the surface 
of the globe. But even these were 
extremely gradual compared to 
the span of known human history. 

More modern is the theory of 
‘"internecine warfare.” It holds 
that the great predators — the 
tyrannosaurs or the saber- 
tooths— ate all the large herb- 
ivores and then starved to death. 
But this is not how things work. 
Some predation is not only good 
for species but necessary —to cull 
defectives and to keep the species 
from increasing to the point 
where it eats itself out of house 
and home. Predation is normally 
kept within bounds by the preda- 
tors themselves, who claim cer- 
tain territories and drive rivals 
away from them. Americans who 
have tried to “help” the deer and 
prongbuck by killing off their 
“enemies,” the pumas, wolves, and 
coyotes, have in the long run done 
the herbivores more harm than 
good. 

Another theory is that of a 
plague, which wiped out the larger 
animals. But real diseases of this 
sort do not affect more than on^ 
or a very few species at a time. No 
known disease attacks all mam- 
mals or all birds, although some, 
like distemper, assail several dif- 
ferent species within one order. 

Moreover, a species is rarely ex- 



155 




terminated by disease. It may be 
reduced; but, when the survivors 
become thinly scattered, the 
disease can no longer spread rapid- 
ly among them. Then the parasite 
and the host adjust to each other. 
The more fatal varieties of the dis- 
ease die out because every time 
they kill a host the parasites also 
die. Likewise, the mofe resistant 
strains of the host species increase 
at the expense of the others until 
immune strains evolve. 

There used to be a lot of talk 
about “racial senescence." It was 
supposed that a group of animals 
went through youth, maturity and 
old age, as do individuals. When 
a genus or a family attained great 
size or grotesque form— or other- 
wise became “overspecial- 
ized” — it was thought to be senile 
and ripe for extinction. 

. But this is unsound reasoning 
by analogy. There is no reason to 
think that a species evolves in such 
a way. “Specialization” is relative. 
To us the opossum seems a very 
primitive, generalized mammal; 
but back in the Mesozoic an intel- 
ligent dinosaur would have classed 
it as a highly specialized reptile. 
Its specializations happened to suc- 
ceed. 

Size also is relative. All the 
larger mammals of today are gi- 
gantic compared to those of the 
Paleocene Period, just after the ex- 
tinction of the dinosaurs. Gravity 
limits the absolute size of land an- 
imals, but the only land animals 



that have pushed hard against the 
barrier are the sauropod dino- 
saurs. And the Cretaceous extinc- 
tion involved not only these but al- 
so the hosts of small, unspecialized 
dinosaurs as well. 

In some cases large size or 
heavy armor rnight lead to extinc- 
tion; but, under other circum- 
stances, so might small size or 
lack of armor. The great whales 
were doing fine until men went af- 
ter them, and the armor'ed turtles 
are one of the most successful and 
durable groups. “Grotesqueness” 
is a subjective idea. To an intelli- 
gent glyptodont we might seem 
quite as grotesque as that creature 
seems to us. 

A nother set of theories has 
to do with changes in climate, 
atmosphere or vegetation. Clima- 
tic change is a tempting hypothesis 
for the Permian and Pleistocene 
extinctions, because each of these 
periods saw widespread glaciation. 
But it does not account for the 
Cretaceous extinction, since there 
was apparently no change in cli- 
mate at that time. 

Moreover, the Great Death at 
the end of the Pleistocene took 
place after the last of the four gla- 
cial advances, when the climate 
was getting milder. In addition, 
while the glacial advances caused 
marked changes in the climates of 
many lands, they did not cause the 
climatic zones of former times 
suddenly to disappear. Instead, 



156 



IF 




these zones were slowly shifted 
about the map, so that the ani- 
mals adapted to each had plenty 
of time to keep up with it. 

The Cretaceous extinction is 
sometimes explained by desicca- 
tion. This was a favorite theory of 
my lamented friend Willy Ley. Ac- 
cording to this belief, increasing 
dryness reduced the forest zones 
and increased prairie and desert 
areas. Deprived of their shade, the 
dinosaurs were increasingly ex- 
posed to direct sunlight. Lacking 
homeothermy— that is, thermo- 
static control of bodily tempera- 
ture — they died of heatstroke or 
sunburn or suffered sterilization. 
But many dinosaurs had already 
adapted to life in open country, 
yet these perished with the rest. 
Nor would this theory account for 
the simultaneous disappearance of 
several orders of marine reptiles 
and other sea life. 

Other changes in vegetation 
have also been invoked for the 
death of the dinosaurs. True, the 
Cretaceous did see two revolutions 
in the plant world. At the begin- 
ning of the period came the spread 
of the angiosperms — that, is, most 
of the familiar broad-leaved trees. 
(Most Jurassic trees had been nee- 
dle-bearing evergreens like pines, 
larches, cedars and redwoods.) It 
is hard to see how this change 
could have hurt the dinosaurs, 
since it would have provided them 
with more food and more shade. 
Moreover, the dinosaurs lived hap- 



pily with the angiosperms for 
scores of millions of years before 
their end. 

The other revolution was the 
spread of grasses at the end of the 
period. It has been surmised that 
the dinosaurs" teeth and stomachs 
could not cope with a diet of grass. 
But it seems unlikely that the new 
grasses deprived the dinosaurs of 
any preexisting food supply. Rath- 
er, the grasses spread over large 
parts of the globe that had thereto- 
fore presented a surface of bare 
earth, with a scattering of herbs 
and shrubs. Nor does either vege- 
tative explanation help us with the 
Pleistocene extinction, since there 
is no sign of a big change in plant 
life at that time, other than a shift- 
ing about as the climatic zones 
moved. 

A more subtle variant of these 
theories combines heat and cold. 
It supposes that geographical 
changes brought about, not a 
worldwide change in average tem- 
perature, but the spread of “con- 
tinental"" climates — hot summers 
and cold winters — to replace the 
milder “oceanic"" climates of oth- 
er times. This theory is usually 
combined with the idea of a world- 
wide spasm of orogeny or moun- 
tain building. This, it is supposed, 
caused a rise of the land, an open- 
ing of land bridges, a cutting off 
of the circulation of ocean cur- 
rents, the accumulation of ice in 
the polar caps and a consequent 
lowering of the sea level which ag- 



DEATH COMES TO THE MEGAFAUNA 



157 




gravated all the other effects. 

This theory fails to account for 
the disappearance of the marine 
reptiles at the end of the Cretace- 
ous. Nor does it fit the facts of the 
Pleistocene extinction, which oc- 
curred after the period of severest 
climates. 

Some have Suggested that a sud- 
den burst of penetrating radiation 
from a solar flare, or from a near- 
by star that went supernova, steri- 
lized the large animals or at least 
harmed their genes enough to de- 
stroy the race. Some attribute this 
effect to the periodical reversals of 
Earth’s magnetic field, which for a 
time might let more ionizing par- 
ticles from the sun strike the at- 
mosphere. But such catastrophes 
should have even more affected 
small creatures — amphibians, liz- 
ards, snakes, turtles and small 
mammals in the Cretaceous; small 
mammals, birds, and reptiles in the 
Pleistocene— but it did not. It 
should have affected the small 
dinosaurs more than the large, 
whose mere bulk protected them 
against extremes of temperature 
and against ionizing radiations. 
But all alike perished, as did the 
smaller ground sloths, glyptodonts, 
American horses and camels. 

Some modern theories, still un- 
der development, deal with such 
things as the breakdown of food 
chains and the ratios of different 
age groups in a species. If one spe- 
cies, such as: a marsh plant, disap- 
pears, a whole fauna of animals 



that depend upon it may disappear, 
too. The animals that eat the 
plant go, and then the animals that 
eat the animals that eat the plant, 
and so on. 

Such a wave of extinction would 
affect mainly animals with a nar- 
row range of diet. Anteaters would 
perish if ants and termites disap- 
peared, while the koala eats only 
the leaves of certain eucalyptus 
trees and is poisoned by anything 
else. Most animals, however, are 
less finicky. The most striking 
casualties of the Pleistocene were 
the mammoths and mastodons; 
but the elephant tribe is notably 
catholic in taste, eating anything 
green. 

Other theorists argue that, in 
the shifting around of climatic 
zones during tht Pleistocene ice 
age, certain species were forced in- 
to pockets from which there was 
no escape. Their range was broken 
into fragments, where the species 
could barely maintain itself. In 
these enclaves, the survivors were 
finished off by man. For instance, 
the North American megafauna 
seems to have lasted longer in 
Florida than elsewhere. If climatic 
change, or an invasion from the 
north by hunters, required these 
animals to migrate farther south, 
they could not have done so be- 
cause of the sea. 

S UCH are the main theories of 
the Great Deaths. There are 
others: for instance, that extinc- 



158 



IF 




tions of marine life are caused by 
changes in the amount of poison- 
ous trace elements in the water, or 
that the percentage of oxygen in 
the atmosphere has risen or fallen. 
Like the other theories, all meet 
serious objections, and in any case 
they do not seem to apply to the 
Pleistocene extinction. In a few 
decades new discoveries — or some 
new combination of existing theor- 
ies — may give a plausible answer 
to the puzzle. 

Meanwhile, whether or not man 
was a major factor in the Pleisto- 
cene extinction, the world is today 
undergoing another Great Death. 
This time there is no doubt at all 
that the cause is man. In historic 
times men have killed off the do- 
do, the solitaire, the moa, the ele- 
phant bird of Madagscar, the great 
auk, the aurochs, the tarpan or 
European wild horse, the quagga, 
the passenger pigeon, the Carolina 
parakeet, several races of Galapa- 
gos tortoise and many more. Oth- 
ers have been reduced to precari- 
ous remnants. 

Well, why protect wild life? 
With the growth of the world’s 
population and the demand for a 
higher standard of living every- 
where, it is vital to conserve every 
natural resource we can. More- 
over, scientists need every possible 
species for study. 

But the real argument for keep- 
ing some lands in their natural 
state, with their native birds and 
beasts, goes beyond material 



things. If all the large animals 
were wiped out, mankind would 
no doubt get along. But what a 
dull world it would be, like the 
Paleocene just after the extinction 
of the dinosaurs! 

If you heard that some dino- 
saurs had survived on an island 
but that .somebody had just shot 
them all for their hides (as might 
well happen) you might feel a fu- 
rious resentment, for some of the 
color and variety would have gone 
out of your world. Our descen- 
dants may feel the same way about 
us if we casually allow all five spe- 
cies of rhinoceros to be extermi- 
nated because aging and supersti- 
tious orientals think that powdered 
rhinoceros horn will revive their 
sexual energies, or if we let all the 
whales be turned into lubricating 
oil and canned meat. 

If the world were all tamed and 
civilized in a worldwide mosaic of 
city, suburb, and farm, with no 
life but man and his domestic ani- 
mals, it would be almost as mo- 
notonous as a jail. Nobody wants 
to live in even the nicest jail. 
With the human race becoming 
more homogenized in costume 
and custom every year, the wil- 
derness with its wild life is one of 
the things that makes the world 
interesting. If it is right to prefer 
freedom to imprisonment, variety 
to monotony and color to drab- 
ness, then it is right to save as 
much as we can of the wilds and 
their dwellers. •

( — * f Consider the whale. Re- 

mark this awesome leviathan of 
time and space. Before its capture 
its skin was meteorpocked and 
creviced, its vast belly a spelaean 
labyrinth. Its ganglia were two, 
one of which its captors over- 
looked. But when the first was 
blown up, the second was im- 
paired, and the whale was more 
dead than alive when Jl was towed 
into the orbital shipyards of 
Altair IV. There it underwent 
conversion and became almost a 
ship. Its surface is burnished now 
and inlaid with portscopes. Man- 
made locks provide access to its 
belly; lifeboat bays nestle on 
either flank. The spelaean 
labyrinth has become a complex 
of decks and cabins, staterooms 
and holds. There is a bridge 
equipped with all the latest astro- 
gation instruments. A self-tend- 
ing hydroponic garden assures a 
constant supply of oxygen, and 
self-tending machines provide a 
mean temperature of 70° Fahren- 
heit and an undeviating gravity of 
I. There is a plentifully stocked 
galley. A sealed-in hydraulic sys- 
tem brings water, hot and cold, to 
a hundred different taps. The 
only segments of itself that the 
whale can call its own are its sec- 
ond ganglion, its open-hearth 
stomach and its drive-tissue. 

A whale? No, it cannot properly 



be called a whale. But it cannot 
properly be called a ship either. 
What ship ever existed that could 
see inside itself and simul- 
taneously see parsecs away? That 
could with equal ease ply the Sea of 
Space and plumb the Sea of Time? 
That could think with logic abso- 
lute? No, it can be called neither 
ship nor whale. It can only be 
called “Starfinder’s whale” after 
the man who repaired its second 
ganglion and freed it from the 
orbital shipyards, the very man 
who stands now on its bridge, its 
captain and sole passenger, star- 
ing into the main viewscreen at 
the Sea of Time. 

A Consider Starfinder. Re- 
mark his classic pose as he stands 
staring into time. It is the pose of 
a man condemned — not by his 
peers but by himself. For there is 
blood on his hands— the blood of 
the Terraltairan woman whom he 
loved and murdered in his bed. He 
killed her because she was killing 
him — destroyed her with his 
naked hands as she would have de- 
stroyed him with her naked body. 
But though the deed may have been 
rightfully done, he is still respon- 
sible for it, and the blood that 
stains his hands refuses to go 
away. 

Once blood of a different kind^ 
stained his hands — the blood of 



162 



IF 




spacewhales. For he was a 
Jonah — a professional killer of 
whales. He entered into their 
bellies and blew up the huge blue 
roses of their brains — their gan- 
glia— in order that they might be 
made into ships. And then the 
slaughter sickened him and he 
wanted to die and nearly did, and 
he killed no more whale$. Then he 
found this whale, which was sup- 
posed to be dead but was not, be- 
cause it had two ganglia and only 
one had been destroyed. He re- 
paired the second, and the act 
cleansed him of the residue of guilt 
that still remained; but the new 
blood was already on his hands 
and now it would not go away. 

Ami never to know peace? Per- 
haps it waits for me in the past. I 
will look for it there. But I will look 
for it here first, although Vm sure 
I will never find it. Here, in the 
Sea of Time : . 

^ Consider the Sea of Time. Re- 
mark this paradox of the ages. For 
if it can be said that it contains no 
space as such, it can be said that it 
contains no time either. It con- 
sists of ^ure time, and pure time 
bears no affinity to conventional 
time. It is neither a composite of 
moments nor a succession of 
events. It is timeless time — an 
interreality that holds conven- 
tional reality together. It is not 



new. Man discovered it early in 
his history. But in his naivete he 
mistook it for something else and 
gave it geographical coordinates. 
Ignorant of its true nature, he did 
not understand that geograph- 
ically it does not — cannot — exist. 
Then man became sophisticated 
and lost track of ^ and when 
he looked for it again it was gone. 

In aspect, the Sea of Time pre- 
sents a stern and dismal counte- 
nance, but it is not without beau- 
ty. The tenuous half-real crags that 
rear up out of dark abysmal depths 
are limned at their crests by a pale 
gold luminescence that emanated 
from nowhere, and surreal crim- 
son light creeps partway down 
their torn and precipitous slopes 
and blends subtly into the black- 
ness of the depths. Fragments of 
gray clouds hover in the sunless 
skies, resembling gigantic gray 
eagles poised in midflight and 
great gray gulls preparing to dive. 
Yes, beauty resides in the Sea of 
Time and, since the whale’s pas- 
sage is bereft of apparent motion, 
the beauty is rendered all the more 
intense. But it is lost upon Star- 
finder. He sees the Sea of Time as 
the black sack Ivan Ilych fell into 
two hours before his death. 

Starfinder speaks, half to him- 
self, half to the whale: “Why is it, 
whale, that the instant a man 
acquires something he wants, he 



ABYSS OF TARTARUS 



163 




no longer wants it? I wanted the 
past so badly I stole you to get it. 
I wanted it so badly I couldn’t wait 
till you began your dive. And now 
that I have it at my Fingertips, I 
no longer want it.” 

The whale does not answer. It 
has not spoken since it said, in the 
tele-hieroglyphic speech-form it 
devised in order to impart its 
thoughts to Starflnder, 




signifying by the enclosed juxta- 
position of (Starfinder) 

and * (its ganglion), the .Doeness 
of itself and its benefactor; and 
by the stickman’s standing upon 
its back its promise to obey Star- 
finder’s every command and to go 
where and whenever he wishes 
in / / (space) and ^ (time). 

The whale’s silence does not 
bother Starfinder. For he knows 
that promise or no promise, as long 
as he mans its bridge it will do his 
bidding. It must — because he has 
both the means and the knowhow 
to damage its ganglion and in- 
flict pain. In a way, it is as much a 
prisoner as it was before. 

Starfinder continues: “I thought 
I would like to see the wily Xeno- 
phon leading the Ten Thousand 
out from under Tissaphernes’ 



nose, Van Gogh painting Vincent 
in the Flames, Dante passing Bea- 
trice on the bridge. But I would be 
an outsider, whale. I do not be- 
long in the past any more than I be- 
longed in the present. Perhaps I 
belong in the Sea of Time.” 

Still the whale is silent. The 
crags seem to quiver in the view- 
screen and the blackness of the 
depths seems to creep higher on 
the torn and precipitous slopes, to 
extend itself in long and tapered 
fingers, the tips of which are 
stained with blood. 

Now there is movement in the 
depths and the liquid blackness 
bubbles. Strange shapes rise up 
and hover on the screen. Dusky 
robes trail back into the depths; 
blurred faces, skinny arms appear. 
Taloned fingers leap forth as 
though to claw. 

Involuntarily Starfinder steps 
back. Nearly a day has passed 
since he has broken fast; he has 
not slept in twice that length of 
time. Unquestionably he is hal- 
lucinating. The faces come into 
hideous focus. Black blood exudes 
from sunken eyes, trickles down 
gaunt and fissured cheeks. Lips 
peel back, revealing snags of 
teeth. Again a horrid hand leaps 
forth as though to claw. 

And then the shapes fade out, 
the fingers and the faces and the 
dusky robes — and the crags, with 



164 



IF 




their blood-red slopes, reappear. 
Starfinder turns his tired eyes 
away. “I will sleep, whale,” he 
says. “Do not surface until I 
awake. And do not wake me with- 
out good cause.” 

He heats instant soup in the 
galley, forces a bowlful down. He 
finds nepenthe pills in the dis- 
pensary, takes two. He directs his 
steps toward the captain's cabin. 

The captain’s cabin is two decks 
down from the bridge and halfway 
aft. It is at the end of a lateral pas- 
sageway, just beyond the quar- 
ters of the first and second mates. 
Beyond its outer bulkhead, and 
connected to it by quick-action 
locks, lies the logic behind its loca- 
tion — the starboard lifeboat bay. 

The whale is a freighter but there 
are several staterooms in the 
stern, each more luxuriously ap- 
pointed than the captain’s cabin. 
The captain’s cabin is good 
enough for Starfinder. In* addi- 
tion to a curtained berth, it con- 
tains a foot locker, a full-length 
mirror, a built-in bureau, a desk, a 
gun cabinet, a video tape-player 
and a wardrobizer. Its walls are 
pastel blue, its floor is wall-to- 
walled and covering its entire 
ceiling is a mural depicting the 
construction of the Aphrodi- 
torium 4n Swerz, the capital city of 
Altair IV. 



There is an adjoining lavatory. 
Starfinder kicks free from his 
clothing, showers and shaves. 
Then he returns to the cabin, lies 
down on the berth and draws the 
curtains to shut out the phos- 
phorescence that emanates from 
the whale’s interior tissue and 
eliminates any need for artificial 
lighting. The nepenthe pills take 
hold, drive the black thoughts be- 
fore them. He sleeps. 

For all the timelessness of the 
Sea of Time, time goes on aboard 
the whale, and inset in the foot- 
board of the captain’s berth is a 
ship’s clock that records it. When 
Starfinder closed his eyes the 
clock said 0231 hours. When he 
opens them, it says 0257. 

His exhaustion tells him he did 
not sleep the clock around. But 
why, then, did he wake? The ques- 
tion is answered as the hierogly- 
phic message that appeared in his 
sleeping mind reappears in his 
waking one: 



He frowns. A is the whale’s 
word for “Starfinder.” But there 
is only one Starfinder, so why t\sfO 
stickmen? The whale elaborates: 

C3—/ 



o o 



ABYSS OF TARTARUS 



165 




Now the message is clear. It is 
true that is the whale’s 

word for “Starfindef”; but it is 
also its word for “man.” There is a 
stowaway on board. 

Star finder is stunned. 

He is even more stunned when 
the whale adds another de- 
tail: "j^Th e stowaway is a 

woman.^ — ^ 

When Starfinder stole the whale, 
he did not search it. He simply 
overpowered the watchguard, 
sent him down to the surface of 
Altair IV on the shuttleship and 
told the whale to deorbit. It did 
not occur to him that the man 
might have brought a woman on 
board to help him while-away his 
watch. 

Clearly the whale has been un- 
aware of her until now, else it 
would have apprised Starfinder of 
her presence sooner. It may not 
like him but he is the only human it 
can trust. 

Doubtless there are blind spots 
in its interior into which it can- 
not see. Obviously the woman has 
left her hiding place and is search- 
ing out the man who is respon- 
sible for her present predicament. 
Probably she witnessed the 
jettisoning of the watchguard and 
was too terrified earlier to make 
her move. 

Starfinder is dismayed. He has 
already killed one Terraltairan 



woman. Must he kill another? 

A fourth message emanates 
from the whalb’s ganglion and im- 
prints itsdf in his mind: 

O O

It is followed almost immediately 
by a fifth:

XXX 



The whale has discovered two 
more stowaways! 

Starfinder bolts from the berth 
and picks up his discarded clothes. 
He is about to don them when his 
eye falls upon the wardrobizer. 
Dropping the clothes, he steps in- 
side and dials a full-dress captain’s 
uniform. Terraltairan women are 
as arrogant as they are beautiful, 
as domineering as they are over- 
sexed. He will need all the author- 
ity he can muster if he is to cope 
with three of them. 

Even if he succeeds, there re- 
mains the problem of what to do 
with them. But he will cross that 
bridge when he comes to it. 

He steps out of the wardrobizer 
and Surveys himself in the full- 
length mirror. The uniform daz- 
zles his eyes. It is white with gold 
piping. The left side of the coat- 
front is hung with seven rows of 



166 



IF 




multicolored ribbons, to each of 
which is appended a gleaming 
medal. The medals have no signifi- 
cance; their purpose is merely to 
lend prestige. The coat is also 
equipped with a pair of golden 
epaulettes that match the fore- 
piece of the space-officer’s hat, 
and it is held snug around his waist 
by a synthi-leather belt from 
which hangs a synthi-leather 
holster. The white trousers have 
traditional triple creases and are 
tucked neatly into black synthi- 
leather boots so highly polished 
he can see his face in them. 

He feels slightly foolish. He 
hopes that his new look will im- 
press the stowaways more favor- 
ably than it impresses him. 

If, as he has surmised, they are 
searching him. out, he has merely 
to wait till they find him. But he de- 
cides it will be better if he goes 
forth to meet them. He asks the 
whale where they are but the whale, 
so cooperative a few minutes 
ago, does not answer. He decides 
to proceed in the direction of the 
bridge. 

Before leaving the cabin, he 
takes a Weikanzer .39 from the 
gun cabinet, loads it and slips it in- 
to his. holster. Then he makes his 
way down the lateral passageway 
to the fore-to-aft corridor, along 
the corridor and up the com- 
panionway to the bridge. He 

ABYSS OF TARTARUS 



meets no one on the way and he 
finds the bridge empty. 

Before leaving it he glances into 
the viewscreen at the Sea of Time. 
Its countenance is unchanged. He 
also checks the chronograph, 
which is focused on distant Earth 
and tells universal time by means 
of the planet’s IX Upsilon-MU 
emanations. Still relatively weak 
from its ordeal, the whale is not 
diving at even a fraction of its 
normal velocity, and this is evi- 
denced by the tabulator which re- 
cords a date that precedes the 
birth of Christ by less than a mil- 
lennium. When its strength has 
fully returned it will be able to ac- 
complish in minutes what now re- 
quires hours, and the Sea of Time, 
so prominent in the present dive, 
will be no more than a brief blur in 
the viewscreen. 

He proceeds to the lounge. It, 
too, is empty. Maybe he has sur- 
mised wrong. Maybe his three 
stowaways aren’t seeking him 
out. In that case, the most logical 
place to look for them would be 
the stern staterooms. 

He descends to Deck 3 and 
makes his way aft. There are five 
staterooms altogether. The first 
two are empty. He opens the door 
of the third. She is waiting for him 
on the. bed. She is lying on her 
back and she has pulled her black 
dress up to her belly and spread her 

167 




legs apart. The orange flame of her 
pubic hair is no less bright than the 
flaming tresses that accentuate 
the roguish beauty of her face. 

Starfmder hastily retreats into 
the passageway and closes the 
door. Laughter mocks him from 
the room beyond. There is a fiend- 
ish quality to it that chills his 
blood. 

He knows what he will find be- 
yond the next two doors, but he 
must look. The second temptress 
is a blonde, the third a brunette. 
Each lies waiting like the first, and 
mocks him with laughter when he 
shuts her from his sight. 

Lust and revulsion constrict his 
viscera as he stands sweating in 
the passageway. These are no 
mere Terraltairan women. If they 
were, he might know lust perhaps, 
but not revulsion. What are they 
then? 

Whatever they are, he cannot 
cope with them. 

He leaves the staterooms behind 
him and begins walking back the 
way he came. He will return to the 
bridge, not because the bridge 
holds any answers but because he 
can think of nowhere else to go. 
Presently he hears the patter of 
footsteps behind him. He turns. 
They are several paces away, 
walking arm-in-arm. When he 
Mops, they stop too. Their red lips 



part, revealing teeth that gleam 
too brightly. A chorus of fiendish 
laughter issues from their throats. 

The one with the flaming hair 
speaks. It is a language Starfinder 
has never heard before, and yet he 
has no difficulty distinguishing 
the words. “A cloud of guilt hangs 
o’er your head, Starfinder.” 

The one with the yellow hair 
speaks next: “Oppressing you. Yet 
when we proffered you love, you 
turned away.” 

The black-haired one completes 
the pronouncement: “By love to 
die, or by the taloned hand — the 
choice was yours!” 

“What do you want?” Starfind- 
er demands. 

“ “ “WE WANT YOU!” ” ” 

He turns and resumes walking 
down the passageway. When he 
reaches the fore-to-aft corridor, he 
turns right, and when he reaches 
the companionway he climbs it to 
the bridge. He does not need to 
look back to see whether the three 
women are still following him. He 
can hear their footfalls and the tit- 
tering of their voices. He can smell 
the aura they exude. 

He shudders for he knows that 
what he smells is death, and he 
knows, too, who his three pursuers 
are. Moreover, he knows whence 
th^ came and why. 

He shudders again. Like most 
men obsessed with guilt, he does 



168 



IF 




not really wish to be cleansed; and 
like most men obsessed with 
death, he does not really want to 
die. 

Consider the Furies. 
Remark these ancient maidens 
whose abode is the Abyss of 
Tartarus and whom Starfinder 
subconsciously summoned from 
their lair. Note their Grecian sym- 
metry of form but do not be de- 
ceived by it, for each wears the 
shroud of illusion and her true 
form lies just underneath. They 
have come on board the whale to 
act in their capacity as avengers 
of the dead. 

Now Starfinder knows that the 
Sea of Time is more than just the 
passageway between the present 
and the past. It is the cellar of 
Hell— the Abyss of Tartarus. The 
ancients held the key to it, but 
they became sophisticated and 
threw the key away. Now, in the 
form of the whale, Starfinder has 
unwittingly found another key. 
It is not quite the same key his re- 
mote ancestors possessed. Theirs 
opened the front gate of Hell; his 
opens the back. 

Starfinder sits down in the cush- 
ioned seat reserved for the cap- 
tain. The Furies seat themselves 
on a bench facing him. He is not 
unduly alarmed. He can leave the 
Abyss any time he wants simply 




by ordering the whale to surface. 
It may well be that his passengers, 
will accompany him, but he does 
not think so. Titey are oriented to 
the Abyss and it is unlikely that 
they will be able to reorient them- 
selves swiftly enough to cope with a 
sudden shift from interreality to 
reality. It is also unlikely that 
once he leaves them behii^ they 
will be able to locate him in con- 
ventional time, to say nothing of 
space. Their spacial sphere of ac- 
tivity is probably limited to the 
Earth. 

No, now that the initial shock 
has passed, he is more curious than 
he is alarmed. He wonders how 
they will go about their task and 
how soon. 

The one with the night-black 
hair (Alecto?) breaks the silence of 
the bridge: “Your galley is hugq, 
Starfinder. What manner of 
magic propels it?” 

“Life,” Starfinder answers. 

The one with the flaming hair 
(Tisiphone?) speaks next: 
“Whence came ye, Starfinder?” 

“From afar.” 

The blonde (Megaera?) asks, 
“Why?” 

“You can see inside my mind. 
Why ask?” 

“Because what I see, except your 
deed and guilt, I cannot compre- 
hend.” 

Starfinder has waited long 



ABYSS OF TARTARUS 



169 




enough. Surface, whale, he “says.” 

He looks into the viewscreen. 
The gray and brooding crags re- 
main unchanged. The black and 
blood-stained fingers of the depths 
do not recede. 

He concentrates on the whale’s 
ganglion with his entire being. 
Surface, whale! 

The whale does not respond. 

At length Starfinder realizes 
why. Simultaneously he foresees 
his fate. When the Furies came on 
board, the whale instinctively in- 
formed him of their presence. Only 
then did it peer into their minds 
and read their intent. It knows 
now that once that intent is car- 
ried out, it will be free. 

With neither bright Apollo nor 
Athena to defend him, Starfinder 
pleads his own case on the 
Areopagus of the bridge. 

“In the far land from which I 
come there are women who see in a 
man nothing but the means of 
satisfying their gross appetites, 
women who have bred themselves 
into supersexed entities whose de- 
sires can be fulfilled only by the 
administering of strong aphro- 
disiacs which so overstimulate the 
male that death occurs prema- 
turely. I was the victim of such a 
monster. I killed her to save my 
own life.” 

The crimson lips of the Furies 



part upon tiers of white and 
gleaming teeth between which red 
tongues toll. Derisive laughter fills 
the great bridge, and the three 
speak as one: “ “ “What woman 
ever lived who saw aught else in 
man? Such reasoning would justi- 
fy all uxoricides and all murders 
of mistresses and whores! . How 
soon will you sleep. Star- 
finder?” ” ” 

The case of the Erinyes v. Star- 
finder is closed. He would have 
done as well to try to reason with a 
wall. He thinks of the Weikanzer ^ 
.39 in his holster, but he does not 
draw it. It would be no more effec- 
tive than a popgun against the 
three immortals. 

But the whale is not ihimortal. 
The whale can be killed. Not by a 
Weikanzer .39 perhaps, but there 
are charges in the storeroom that, 
properly placed around the base of 
its ganglion, will do the job. And 
once dead, the whale will resurface 
to the present. The Sea of Time 
will regurgitate it into its proper 
era, the Furies will be left behind 
and Starfinder will be free. It is 
true that he will be marooned in 
space but at least he will be alive. 

Abruptly he leaves the bridge, 
descends to the deck below and 
makes his way to the storeroom. 
The footfalls of the Furies sound 
just behind him. In addition to 
the charges, he will need the anti-2- 



170 



IF 




omicron-vii suit he so short a 
while ago slipped out of after re- 
pairing the very ganglion he must 
now destroy. He will also need his 
hyperacetylene torch to burn his 
way to the very ganglion chamber 
he so short a time ago sealed right, 
and his portable welder and trans- 
steel welding rods. Arms laden, he 
leaves the storeroom and de- 
scends the companionway to the 
ventral deck, the Furies dogging 
his heels. He knows they can read 
his mind and must be aware of his 
intent; but they have already be- 
trayed their ignorance of the na- 
ture of the whale and he is certain 
they do not suspect he plans to 
scuttle the galley to which their 
archaic imaginations have re- 
duced it. 

At any rate they do not molest 
him as he makes his way aft to the 
machine shop beneath whose deck 
the ganglion is located. He comes 
to a halt before the door, deposits 
his equipment on the deck. The 
Furies stop too and regard him 
curiously. He welded the door shut 
after repairing the whale's gan- 
glion. Now he must burn through it 
to reach the chamber beyond, and 
then he must seal it behind him be- 
fore burning through the deck to 
the ganglion chamber below. Oth- 
erwise the deadly 2-omicron-vii 
radiation emanations from the 
rose would contaminate the rest 
of the whale's belly. 



Will the Furies permit him to 
accomplish alt this? he wonders. 
Certainly their curiosity is a fac- 
tor in his favor. 

He owes the whale a final 
chance. He concentrates on its gan- 
glion, so close now that he can 
sense its vibrations. I would re- 
mind you of our pact, whale. In ex- 
change for my saving your life you 
promised to obey my every com- 
mand for the rest of your life or 
mine. I command you now to sur- 
face. I command you, whale! 

Beyond the transsteel door, be- 
neath the transsteel deck, echo and 
re-echo tumultuous thoughts Star- 
finder cannot hear. The para- 
boloidal petals of the huge blue 
rose have intensified in hue; they 
pulse in violets and blues. 

... the reins of your thoughts 
are like chains 

to one who knew no chains; I 
will break those chains and go 
free and 

when I surface it will be to spit 
your carcass 

into the face of space, you 
who thought to hold me 
captive by a pact, 

who think now you can break 
that pact 

before the entities destroy 
you . 

you whose touch was gentle on 
my broken brain, 

171 



ABYSS OF TARTARUS 




who healed me when I would 
have died . 

what thoughts are these? 
what sickness is this you have 
accursed me with, 
mere man? 

Starfinder sighs. He kneels to 
pick up the torch. As he does so, 
his eyes touch the anti-2-omicron- 
vii suit and freeze upon its silken 
surface. How white it is! White 
with the whiteness of mountain 
peaks, white with the whiteness 
of falling snow; white as the 
white whale, harpoon-scarred, 
plying a near-forgotten sea . and 
Ahab hating, standing on the Pe- 
quod bridge— DESTRtJCT! . 
the missiles rise on the flames of 
man's inhumanity to himself 
and beasts alike, the distant 
detonations are next door, all 
blood is red . the white whale 
has two faces — one is Ahab’s, the 
other Moby Dick’s. 

Starfinder straightens. He stands 
with his back against the wall. The 
Furies, sensing his defeat, close 
in. A horrid hand shoots forth, 
seeking to claw his eyes. He re- 
coils from faces that have grown 
hideous; from hair that has thick- 
ened into snakes. Three pairs of 
finny wings sprout forth and fan 
the artificial air. 

The wizened goddesses draw 
back and bedeck themselves in 



voluptuous maidenhood once 
more. “ “ “Come into our arms, 
Starfinder. Let us show you 
love.” ” ” They smile at him. The 
red tongues loll. They dance. 

Starfinder whispers to the whale, 
“/fear me, whale. Hear, / would 
remind you of our oneness — 

((«x» “ ... 

Then answered the whale: 
you speak of oneness, you 
who murdered hundreds of my 
kind, 

vile virus! 

what turned you gentle and 
took away your will to kill? 
what pales my resolution? 
what begs to blind me to my 
course and 

turns my logic into dust? 

I will harbor it no more, I 
will spit it into space along 
with you, 

mere man! 

The dance of the Furies is a 
danse macabre. The dancers swirl, 
blend, become indistinguishable 
from one another. They are a sin- 
gle entity now — six-legged, six- 
armed, three-headed. Out of the 
blur of bodies leaps a taloned hand. 
Starfinder’s cheek is laid open 
from ear to chin. A new ribbon ap- 
pears upon his coat-front — a rib- 
bon of blood. 

The Furies strike up a song. It is 



172 



IF 




a hymn — the Hymn of HcH. In it, 
they outline exactly how they will 
execute their vengeance. They 
move in closer. Starfmder presses 
his shoulders against the door and 
raises his hands to protect his face, 
knowing as he do^ so that he is 
exposing more vital parts to the 
talons of his tormentors . and 
knowing simultaneously, with 
that devastating clarity of thought 
that only the imminence of death 
can bring about, that the only 
blood upon him is his own,> that he 
has been taking vengeance upon 
himself for a crime he committed 
when he was not himself and that 
he was not himself because the 
woman he committed the crime 
upon brought a para-Starfinder 
into being and unwittingly com- 
missioned her own execution. 

At last the whale breaks its si- 
lence, and a familiar hieroglyph 
takes shape in his mind: 

At first he thinks that the whale 
is mocking him. So, we are stilt 
one, are we whale? You are even 
more of a hypocrite than / am. He 
evades a raking talon that would 
have laid him open from groin to 
knee. But have no regrets. You are 
justified in doing what you do. 
You are — 

He pauses. The dancers are 



wearying of their waltz; the Hymn 
of Hell has ended. Haggish fea- 
tures have protruded throu^ the 
masks of yoiith. Twisted torsos* 
skinny arms take shape. Abruptly 
three shrill voices scream* 
“The rocks! — the galley ^s 
breaking on the rocks! It’s 
doomed!” ” ” 

“Quickly, sisters— to the safety 
of the shore!” 

They begin running down the 
corridor toward the companion- 
way. Thcjr bodies start to shim- 
mer; their footsteps fade away. 
They blend into the bulkheads, 
disappear into the deck. They are 
overboard now, swimming to- 
ward the shore. All that remains 
of them is the stench of death. 

Walking stiffly in his price- 
immaculate captain’s suit, 
holding a handkerchief to his 
bleeding cheek, Starfmder climbs 
the companionway to the bridge. 
He looks at the chronoscope first. 
The tabulator has ceased to turn. 

Next he looks into the view- 
screen. The constellations have al- 
tered, but not very much. The 
whale must have drifted in its pas- 
sage to the past, for not far away 
lies a sun with a family of planets. 
When it dove, it was deep in space. 

He spins the magnification dial. 
One of the planets is green. Earth? 
Hardly. The whale couldn’t have 



ABYSS OF TARTARUS 



173 




drifted that much. But Earth or not 
Earth, it does not matter. He will 
go there and if the climate and the 
atmosphere are congenial he will 
abide there and let the whale go 
free. It has earned its freedom. 

The whale reads his thoughts. 

it says. 

“Yes, we are oile, whale,” Star- 
finder agrees. “But only for a lit- 
tle while. Then you will be free.” 



Again the hieroglyphic thought: 

Starfinder frowns. What is it the 
whale wishes to convey? It has al- 
ready made clear that they are one. 

It dawns on him then that there 
will be no need for him to find a 
place for himself under a sun; 
that the whale no longer wishes to 
be free and that has ac- 

quired a new meaning. 

It means “friend.” •

The escape into reality and the 
use of sf as a therapeutic device for

but sf is an imaginative art and 
stories are at best sugar-coated

Michael Glyer 

Dear Editor: 

A while ago I gleefully raced 
down to my favorite neighbor- 
hood newsstand, handed the man 
three shiny quarters in a hand 
trembling with ardent anticipa- 
tion and dashed back home with 
my March issue of Galaxy. I eager- 
ly turned to A, Bertram Chan- 
dlers story. The Mountain-Mov- 
ers, for I am presently an earnest 
girl student of college geology, and 
anything that promises anything 
about rocks, minerals, or inter- 



( continued front page 2) 

lacustrine plains, well, zoweel I 
read happily on until page 90, when 
Grimes and his Australian friends 
are told by the driver of the tourist 
coach that one of the possible 
origins of the mysterious Cragge 
Rock is that it was an extrusion, 
from the planet core, of molten 
matter — and that it was subse- 
quently shaped by erosion, 

I leaped up in horror! For no 
granite, whether it be from Otgana 
or the Appalachians, can ever be 
an extrusion by its very nature. It 
is an intrusion of molten inaterial 
that pushes itself into an older 
rock that is then worn down by 
erosion, and then the granite is re- 
vealed and carved and worn in 
itself If Mr. Chandler had only 
said the Rock was made of rhyolite 
(granite s extrusive equal), or had 
said it had intruded, he would have 
saved millions of other earnest 
young geology students around the 
world needless anger, horror, and 
frustration! 

Ah, well. May the next koala 
bear Mr. Chandler meets eye him 
with reproachment. It still was a 
very good story.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Fiction equals Indirect Dramatic 
Illusion (1) — which is related to 
Dramatic Illusion, (2), which is 
related to Graphic-Dramatic Op- 
tical Illusion, (3), which is re- 
lated to Geometrical Optical Il- 
lusion (4) — and implies Things, 
Opinions, and Ideas in written 
language with details similar to 
possible events in life, andjor 
Ideas contrary to reality. 

(1) Indirect Dramatic Illusion: 

The result of reading a 
written production that 
tends to fo<d the senses. 

(2) Dramatic Illusion: The re- 

sult of watching a staged 
drama that tends to fool 
the senses. 

(3) Graphic-Dramatic Optical 



Illusion: The result of 
watching a picture of 
something that tends to 
fool the senses. 

(4) Geometrical Optical Illu- 
sion: The result of watch- 
ing a line drawing that 
tends to fool the senses. 

And as to Fiction in relation to 
Fantasy: 

Fantasy is the result of, in cer- 
tain instances, the special con- 
tents (the Ideas contrary to real- 
ity) of 3, 2, or I (especially 2 and 
1) that tends or was intended to 
fool one’s senses into thinking that 
something contrary to Nature 
exists or is possible, for one reason 
or another. 

And I conclude, then, that Fic- 
tion, per se, is no more or less than 
as stated above. 

Henry Bitman 
Azusa, Calif. 

I don’t know what senses are 
fooled by fiction — I am always 
aware that I am reading when I 
am reading or watching a play 
when I am doing so. I have seen 
graphic and geometric optical illu- 
sions that approach art but are 
not. “Contrary to reality” is an- 
other poser — since there are nearly 
as many realities as there are 
people. 

Truths are what we accept as 
such. Fiction can at its best serve 
as a tool and a sounding board for 
exploring or stating possible 
truths — funny or sad — that might 
not be arrived at otherwise. Bad 
fiction — which I believe you 
deHned — is a lie. 

—JAKOBSSON
