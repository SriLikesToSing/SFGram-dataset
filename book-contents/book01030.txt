AND HE SEZ 



S OME months ago, I had a 
very disgruntled letter from a 
reader. Not knowing what was 
eating him and unable to grab 
hold of any answerable complaint 
— and, of course, wanting to 
pacify him — I wrote thusly: 
“Dear Mr. Blank: Your tone 
is a lot sharper than your criti- 
cism . .” 

At which point, I halted, im- 
mensely pleased with myself. For 
a long while, I’ve been an ad- 
mirer of a postcard sent out by 
a Menken with the same initials 
as mine, reading: 

“Dear Sir or Madam: You 
may be right.” 

Menken used this stopper 
whenever he received a blistering 
letter, which evidently was often, 
and I liked it because it left abso- 
lutely no room for retort. 

But I like mine better, being 
an inordinate lover of shrewd 
squelches — especially my own. 

One of my favorites was com- 
mitted by Cardinal Newman, a 
Catholic wit who made G. K. 
Chesterton sound merely preco- 
cious. Newman was coming from 
a religious convention of some 
kind and was lucky enough to 
snag a cab in the London rain. 
A minister asked if Newman 
minded his coming along because 
the odds on getting another cab 

2 



were small. Newman, of course, 
agreed. 

As they settled back, the minis- 
ter said lightly, “It’s only right 
that we should share a taxi. After 
all, we both serve God.” 

“Yes,” said Newman. “You in 
your way and I in His.” 

Another splendid English 
squelcher was the Rev. Sidney 
Smith. He was properly scolded 
by a friend who said: 

“That damnable sense of 
humor of yours is what keeps 
you from getting a church you 
can make a decent living from. 
Why can’t you be like your 
brother? He’s sober and industri- 
ous. He takes things seriously and 
look at him — a success instead 
of a jocular failure like you!” 
“True,” Smith admitted sadly. 
“My brother has risen because of 
his gravity and I have been held 
down by my levity.” 

Smith was an energetic letter- 
writer and so could have claimed 
repartee when the reply may 
actually have occurred to him 
days later. But that’s not true of 
a retort Disraeli made within 
seconds — — there are records of 
Parliament that give all the 
necessary proof. 

Gladstone, you know, was a 
bitter enemy of Disraeli and con- 
cluded a slashing attack with: 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Mark my words! This scoundrel 
will either die on the scaffold or 
of a loathsome disease!” 

Disraeli got to his feet and 
said quietly, “That depends, sir, 
on whether I embrace your prin- 
ciples or your mistress.” 

Like Smith, a neglected genius 
is Oliver Hereford — he’s so 
neglected that I’m not even sure 
if I’ve spelled his last name right 
— whose comment that “My 
wife has a whim of iron” has been 
appropriated by non-wits whose 
only right to fame is a good 
memory. 

Hereford went to see an exhi- 
bition of what may generously be 
called art by Maxfield Parrish. 
The irony here is that Parrish, 
who probably would have used 
syrup instead of paint if that had 
been possible, is listed in diction- 
aries while Hereford is not. 

Hereford paused in front of a 
painting of a typical Parrish 
young man, studied it a moment 
and sighed: “How touching! A 
youth blossoming into woman- 
hood!” 

Those, as you can see, are bit- 
ing remarks. But there are others 
that do the same job without the 
sting. For example, I was in 
artillery training at Fort Bragg, 
in North Carolina, and my pla- 
toon had marched to the howitzer 
site, where another platoon was 
taking a break before going on 
to its next course. I was aghast 



to see the sergeant, a typical 
harsh-barking type, showing his 
men how to play hopscotch and 
jacks. Naturally, I asked how 
come. 

He looked at me coldly and 
snapped, “If kids can play soldier, 
why can’t soldiers play kid?” 
Maybe you can think of a 
counter-squelch. I couldn’t. 

But there is another I thought 
up that I’m proud of. I just wish 
Descartes could hear it, for it’s 
my rebuttal to his “Cogito ergo 
sum” — “I think, therefore I am.” 
My version is “Cogito sum ergo 
sum — cogito,” which translates, 
preferably if given a Mexican 
accent, as “I think I am, there- 
fore I am — I theenk.” 

Now, to give all this an appro- 
priate flavor of science fiction, I 
should make at least a stab at 
extrapolating. The truth is that I 
don’t feel much like doing so; 
they’re good enough to stand on 
their own — with the possible 
exception of my conversation 
stoppers. 

Well, not entirely without a 
sort of wistful personal extrapo- 
lation. There will be some cork- 
ing squelches in the future and I 
just wish I had a record of them 
in advance. Or do you suspect 
that movies and TV will reduce 
repartee to a bleak “Oh, yeah?” 
If they do, posterity can have 
the future!

The Mapmakers 

By FREDERIK POHL 



Before any ship could span light-years in a 




single jump, hyperspace had to be charted— 
though Man was blind in that awesome chaos! 



Illustrated by ASHMAN

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





I T was one of those crazy, 
chance - in - a - million acci- 
dents. A particle of meteoric 
matter slammed into Starship 
Terra II in hyperspace. It was 
only a small particle, but it pene- 
trated three bulkheads, injuring 
Lieutenant Groden and destroy- 
ing the Celestial Atlas. It couldn’t 
happen in a hundred years — but 
it had happened. 

That was the end of the road 
for Starship Terra II. The dam- 
age-control parties patched the 
bulkheads easily enough. But the 
Atlas — the only record on board 
of the incomprehensible Rieman- 
nian configurations of hyperspace 
— was a total loss. 

The Captain gave orders for 
Spohn, the Celestial Atlas, to be 
buried in space and called an 
emergency officer’s meeting in the 
wardroom. 

Terra II was in normal space 
and free fall. A trace of smoky 
kerosene odor still hung in the 
wardroom, but there was none of 
the queasy unrecognizable slip- 
ping motion of the hyperspace 
“jump,” and the Captain had or- 
dered the ship spun to give them 
a touch of simulated gravity. The 
officers were managing to look 
alert and responsive as they faced 
their skipper. 

t|tHE Captain was a hard- 
muscled, hard - eyed career 
naval officer, and by definition

an ambitious man — else he would 
hardly have asked for the com- 
mand of a charting flight. He 
walked briskly in from his own 
quarters, neither hurrying nor 
slow. He would walk at that 
same pace to receive his admiral’s 
stars when that day came, or to 
his* execution, if it ever came to 
that. 

He assumed his place at the 
head of the table and took the 
precise ten seconds his martinet 
mind allotted him for looking 
around the wardroom. Then he 
said, “We’re in trouble.” 

The men in the wardroom 
hitched their hips a quarter inch 
closer to the ward table. 

The Captain nodded and said 
it again, “We’re in the soup, and 
we’re a long way from home, and 
nobody is going to come to get 
us out of it. We’ll have to do it 
ourselves, if we can. Ciccarelli’s 
trying to get us a fix, but I can 
tell you right now, we’re not close 
to Sol. There isn’t a constellation 
in the sky that you or I or any- 
body else ever saw before. We 
might be a hundred light-years 
from home, we might be ten 
thousand.” 

The Exec cleared his throat. 
“Sir, what about our records?” 
“What records? They went 
with the Atlas, Hal. We can’t 
retrace our way to Earth.” 

“No, sir, that’s not what I 
mean. I understand that. But our 



charting records from Earth to 
here, we still have those. They 
won’t do us any good, because 
we can’t follow them backward 
— hyperspace doesn’t work that 
way. But Earth needs them.” 

“Sure. What can we do about 
it? If we could get them back, 
we could get back ourselves. The 
whole trouble — Yes? What is it, 
Lorch?” 

Ensign Lorch saluted from the 
door of the wardroom. “Spohn’s 
body, sir,” he rapped out. “It’s 
ready for burial now. Would the 
Captain like to conduct the serv- 
ices?” 

“The Captain will. What about 
Groden?” 

Lorch said, “He isn’t good, sir. 
He’s unconscious and his head is 
bandaged up. The surgeon thinks 
it’s bad. But we won’t know for 
sure for at least a couple of 
hours.” 

The Captain nodded, and 
Lorch quickly took his seat. He 
was the youngest officer on Terra 
II in years, six months out of 
the Academy and still unable to 
vote. He listened to the discus- 
sion of ways and means with 
deference masking a keen feeling 
of excitement. The adventure of 
the unknown star lanes! That 
was why Lorch had signed up in 
the charting service, and he was 
getting it. 

Perhaps more, even, than he 
had bargained for.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rriHE trouble with Terra II was 
-*• that she was playing a cosmic 
game of blind-man’s-buff. Jump- 
ing into hyperspace was like 
leaping through a shadow, blind- 
folded; there was no way of 
knowing in advance what lay on 
the other side. 

The first hyperspace rocket 
had taught a few lessons, ex- 
pensively learned. On its first 
jump into hyperspace, Terra I 
had been “out” for. just under 
one second — just time enough, 
that is, for the jump generators 
to swing the ship into and out of 
the Riemannian n-dimensional 
composite that they called hyper- 
space for lack of a better term. 

And it had taken Terra I near- 
ly a year to limp back home, in 
normal space all the way, its 
generators a smoldering ruin. 
Back still again to the drawing 
boards ! 

But it was no one’s fault. Who 
could have foreseen that any 
electric current, however faint, 
would so warp the field as to 
blow up the generators? The les- 
son was plain: 

No electrical equipment in use 
during a jump. 

So Terra I , rebuilt, re-equipped 
and with a new crew, tried again. 
And this time there were no 
power failures. The only failure, 
this time, was the human ele- 
ment. 

Because in hyperspace, the 

THE MAPMAKERS 



Universe was a crazy-quilt of 
screaming patterns and shimmer- 
ing lights, no more like the or- 
dered normal-space pattern of 
stars than the view through a 
kaleidoscope is like the colored 
shreds of paper at its focus. 

So the Celestial Atlas was 
added to the complement of a 
hyperspace rocket’s crew. And 
Terra I was rebuilt, and Terra II 
and Terra III and Terra IV came 
off the ways. And Earth cast its 
bait into the turgid depths of 
hyperspace again and again. 

The crews of the charting serv- 
ice were all volunteers, all rigidly 
screened. The ten officers that 
made up the wardroom of Terra 
II were as brilliant and able a 
group as ever assembled, but the 
emergency officers’ meeting was 
a failure, all the same. 

There just wasn’t any way 
back. 

“We’re the trail-blazers,” rum- 
bled the Captain. “If we had a 
duplicate Celestial Atlas — but we 
don’t. Well, that’s something for 
the next ship to bear in mind, if 
we ever get back to tell them 
about it.” 

E NSIGN Lorch said tentative- 
ly, “Sir, don’t we have one?” 
The Captain rasped, “Of course 
not, man! I just finished saying 
we didn’t. You should know 
that.” 

“Yes, sir. But that’s not exact- 

7 



ly what I meant. We have a 
Library and, as I understand it, 
the Library is basically the same 
as the Atlas — a trained total- 
recall observer. Doesn’t any of 
the information in the Library 
duplicate the Atlas?” 

“Now that,” said the Captain 
after a pause, “is worth thinking 
about. What about it, Hal?” 
The Exec said, “Worth a try, 
Captain.” 

“Right. Yoel, get her up here.” 
Lieutenant Yoel saluted and 
spoke into the communications 
tube. The Captain went on re- 
flectively. “Probably won’t work, 
of course, but we’ll try anything. 
Anybody else got a suggestion?” 
“Dead reckoning, sir?” Yoel 
suggested. “I know we’ve got the 
record of our fixes so far; can we 
try just backtracking?” 

“Won’t work,” the Captain 
said positively. “If we could be 
absolutely exact, maybe. But 
without an Atlas we can’t be. 
And a centimeter’s divergence at 
the beginning of a run might put 
us a thousand kilometers off at 
the end. A thousand kilometers 
in hyperspace — heaven knows 
what that might come to in nor- 
mal space. Anything from a mil- 
lion light-years down. 

“I couldn’t do it, Yoel. Even 
Groden couldn’t do it with his 
eyes, and he’s the best ship- 
handler on board. And I don’t 
think he’s going to have his eyes, 



anyway, at least not for a long 
time. Maybe forever, if we don’t 
get back to the eye banks on 
Earth. Without the Atlas, we’re 
as blind as Groden.” 

The speaking tube interrupted 
and rescued Yoel. It whistled 
thinly: “Recorder Mate Eklund 
reporting to the wardroom.” 

“Send her in,” said the Exec, 
and the Library, Nancy Eklund, 
RM2c, marched smartly in to the 
meeting. 

TT wasn’t going to work; the 
Captain knew it in the first 
few words. They spent an hour 
sweating the Library of all of her 
relevant data, but it was wasted 
effort. 

The Captain thought wistfully 
of Recorder Mate Spohn, the 
lost Celestial Atlas. With him on 
the bridge, hyperspace naviga- 
tion had been — well, not easy, 
but possible. For Spohn was 
trained in the techniques of total 
recall. The shifting, multicolored 
values of Riemannian space 
formed totals in his mind, so that 
he could actually navigate by 
means of a process of mental 
analysis and synthesis so rapid 
and complex that it became a 
sort of gestalt. 

Of course, a twelve-stage elec- 
tronic computer could have done 
the same thing, just as quickly. 
But Terra II had its limitations, 
and one of the limitations was 



8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that no electronic equipment 
could be operated in a jump — 
just when the computer would 
most be needed. So the designers 
came up with what was, after all, 
a fairly well tested method of fil- 
ing information — the human 
brain. By the techniques of 
hypnotic conditioning all of the 
brain opened up to subconscious 
storing. 

Recorder Mate Spohn, trance- 
like on the bridge, had no con- 
scious knowledge of what was 
going on as, machinelike, he 
scanned the Riemannian con- 
figurations and rapped out 
courses and speeds; but his sub- 
conscious never erred. With its 
countless cells and infinite link- 
ages, the brain was a tank that 
all the world’s knowledge could 
hardly fill — just about big 
enough, in fact, to cope with the 
task of recognizing the meaning 
of hyperspace configurations. 

And the process worked so well 
that the delighted designers add- 
ed another Recorder Mate to the 
personnel tables — the Library — 
which enabled them to dispense 
with the dead weight of books as 
well. 

The entire wardroom, in order 
of rank, shot questions at their 
Library, and her disciplined mind 
dutifully plucked out answers. 

But most of them she never 
knew. For Terra II was a chart- 
ing ship, and though the Atlas 

THE MAPMAKERS 



had, as a matter of routine, 
transcribed his calibrations into 
the ship’s log — and thence into 
the Library — all that Nancy Ek- 
lund knew was how Terra II had 
reached its checkpoints in space. 
Hyperspace was a tricky busi- 
ness; backtracking was danger- 
ous. 

When Terra II got back — if 
T err a II got back — those who 
came after them would have 
complete calibrations for a round 
trip. But they did not. Their task 
was as difficult and dangerous, 
in its way, as Columbus’ caravels. 
Except that Columbus had only 
one great fear; falling off the edge 
of the Earth. 

Lucky Columbus. The tech- 
nology that had produced Terra 
II had brought plenty of new 
fears. 

rpHREE shells “up” — toward 
the ship’s center — a surgeon’s 
mate named Conboy was pulling 
the fourth needle out of the arm 
of Lieutenant Groden. The big 
navigator should have been out 
cold, but he was tossing and 
mumbling, his head thrashing 
from side to side in its thick 
wrappings of bandage. 

Tough guy, thought Conboy 
critically, counting up the am- 
poules of opiate the blinded of- 
ficer had taken. They were all 
tough guys, anyway, from the 
Skipper on down. But the little 

9 



pipettes brought them down to 
size and Conboy, though only an 
inch over five feet tall and the 
frailest on board, was the man 
who drove in the pipettes. 

“He’s under, Mr. Broderick,” 
he reported to the ship’s surgeon, 
who nodded. 

“Keep it so,” the officer or- 
dered. “If anything comes up, 
I’ll be in the wardroom.” The 
Captain would be wanting to 
hear about Groden’s condition, 
and Broderick wanted very much 
to hear what the emergency 
meeting had to say about the 
condition of Terra II in general. 

This was fine with Conboy, 
who had a similar concern of his 
own. As soon as Commander 
Broderick was out of sight, Con- 
boy took a last look at Groden 
and, reassured that the navigator 
would be out of trouble for at 
least half an hour, hurried to the 
next cabin to pry what informa- 
tion he could out of the chart 
room. 

A Spaceman-First named Cor- 
iell was methodically taking op- 
tical measurement on all the stars 
of second magnitude or brighter. 
Conboy looked uncomprehend- 
ingly at the entries on the charts. 
“Got anything?” he asked. 

Coriell spat disgustedly. “Got 
trouble. See that little fellow 
down there, between the two real 
bright ones? That might be 
Canopus. The rough lines check; 



Mr. Ciccarelli’s going to have to 
run a spectrum on it, when he 
gets through with the meeting.” 
Conboy looked sourly at the 
indicated star. It was brighter 
than the average, but far less 
bright than the two that flanked 
it. “Canopus, huh?” he repeated. 
“Suppose it is, Coriell. How far 
from Earth does that put us?” 
Coriell shrugged. ‘What am I, 
a navigator? How’s Groden, by 
the way?” 

“He’ll live. Suppose it is, 
Coriell?” 

“Well — ” Coriell thought for a 
moment. “Depends. If we’re on 
the same side of it as Earth, 
might not be far at all. If we’re 
on the other side — well, Canopus 
is six hundred and fifty light- 
years from Sol.” 

Conboy looked again, longing- 
ly. “Well, thanks,” he said, and 
went back to his patient. 

That was the trouble with 
hyperspace travel, he thought. 
You go in at one point, you 
rocket around until you think it’s 
time to come out, and there you 
are. Where is “there”? Why, 
that’s the surprise that’s in store 
for you, because you never know 
until you get there. 

And sometimes not even then. 

O N the bridge, everything was 
Condition Able. Ensign 
Lorch, booted early out of the 
meeting because he was due to 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



relieve as Junior OOD, signed in 
and made his tour of the ship. 
The damage control parties 
belowdecks were all through with 
the necessary repairs, and keep- 
ing themselves busy with such 
cosmetic tasks as fairing down 
the beads left by the first emer- 
gency welds. It was hot down 
there. 

Lorch conscientiously whistled 
up the bridge on the speaking 
tube and ordered them to start 
the fans and valve enough gas 
into the expansion locks to make 
up for the heat rise. The crew 
quarters were shipshape, even the 
women’s section; the jet cham- 
bers were at stand-by, with the 
jetroom hands busy at their usual 
stand-by task of thumping the 
tubes for possible hidden cracks. 
The working parties were finish- 
ing up the job of restowing the 
cargo that had to be shifted when 
the meteorite hit. 

Lorch signed in the log, and 
paused thoughtfully over the 
spaces for entries of course and 
position. The helmsman was 
smartly at attention at the main 
board, though there was nothing 
for him to do since all jets were 
capped. Lorch glanced at him 
reprovingly, but the helmsman 
was conspicuously correct in his 
behavior. 

It made a problem; Lorch de- 
tested the thought of writing in 
“unknown,” but it certainly 

THE MAPMAKERS 



would be exceeding his authority 
to call the chart room without 
the permission of Lieutenant 
Yoel, his shift commander. Not, 
thought Lorch a trifle rebellious- 
ly, that Yoel was likely to object 
very strongly. 

Yoel was a drafted mathema- 
tician, not a ship-handler. He 
knew very nearly all there was to 
know about geodesic theory and 
the complex equations that lay 
behind the “jump” generators 
and their odd nucleophoretic 
drive. But he was far from a 
model officer, so little conscious 
of the fundamental law of 
R.H.I.P. that he was capable of 
presuming to advise the Captain 
on ship-handling — the scene in 
the wardroom had proved that. 

T ORCH had just about decided 
to call down to the chart 
room when Yoel appeared, sig- 
naling that the meeting was over, 
and Lorch deftly dropped the 
problem in his superior’s lap. 
“Ship on Condition Able,” he re- 
ported briskly. “No maneuver- 
ing during watch; no change in 
operating status during watch. I 
have made no entry for course 
and position, sir. Thought you 
might like to.” 

“I wouldn’t,” Yoel said sourly. 
“Put down ‘unknown.’ Write it 
in big letters.” 

“As bad as that, sir?” 

“As bad as that.” Yoel turned 

11 



his back on his junior and meth- 
odically scanned the segment of 
sky outside the port. It was in 
constant spinning motion, flash- 
ing past the field of vision as 
Terra II whirled on its axis to 
give the crew something ap- 
proaching gravity. 

Lorch cleared his throat. “You 
got nothing out of Eklund, sir?” 
“Oh, sure. We got the absolute 
magnitudes and stellar distances 
of half the stars in the Galaxy.” 
Yoel turned from the port and 
shook his head. “We got a short 
course in Riemannian geometry 
and an outline of the geodesics 
of n-dimensional space. But we 
didn’t get a road map.” He 
glanced at the thermometer on 
the wall and said vaguely, “I 
thought I heard — ” 

He stood up straight. “Mister 
Lorch!” he exploded. “I wasn’t 
hearing things! You were bleed- 
ing air into the expansion locks!” 
“Why, yes, sir. To cool the 
ship,” Lorch explained. “The 
welding torches were — ” 

“Blast the welding torches, 
mister! Did it ever occur to you 
we’re a long way from home?” 
“Yes, sir, but—” 

“But you’re an idiot! But! You 
valve air off as though we had a 
whole world of it. Did it ever 
occur to you that we might be 
in space a long time? Did you 
stop to think that we might run 
out of air?” 



Lorch stared at him wordless. 
For a frozen moment he thought 
his superior had gone mad. 
Spaceships? Spaceships ran from 
point to point. In n-dimensional 
hyperspace, no point was far 
from any other — an hour’s travel, 
perhaps a day’s. Terra II was 
crammed to the gunwales with 
air, by the standards of the serv- 
ice. Run out of air?

E ASY, Sam.” The voice came 
floating up at Groden out of 
blackness. Something was wrong, 
and he was lying down; he grunt- 
ed and started to get up. 

A hand stopped him. The voice 
said, “Easy.” He fell back, and 
felt nothing as he fell. His whole 
body was numbed, only a faint 
tingling sensation where it touch- 
ed what he was lying on. Drug- 
ged, he thought. The voice said, 
“Sam, don’t try to open your 
eyes. Can you hear me?” 

It was like making a statue 

speak, but he got the word out, 
“Yes.” 

“Good. You’ve been hurt. A 

meteorite hit while we were in 

hyperspace. Got the Atlas, and 
something got you right across 
the eyes — drops of molten metal, 
by the scars. You’re — you’re 
blind, Sam. At least for now.” 
“Yes,” he said, after a mo- 
ment. There was a very special 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sort of tingling around the eyes. 

“Maybe we can fix you up 
when we get back to Earth. But 
we’re lost, Sam.” 

Lost? Groden pondered that. 
Lost. It didn’t make sense. Of 
course, if the Atlas was dead — 
But still, how could they be lost? 
He strained to hear what the 
voice was saying; but it had gone 
on to something else. 

Soothingly. “Now, Sam, this i§ 
going to hurt. We’ve got to 
change the dressings.” Business 
of tingling, and more tingling of 
a different sort, but not anything 
that Groden could call painful. 
And then, suddenly and surpris- 
ingly, it hurt very much. He 
tried to speak, but the voice said, 
“Easy, Sam. It will only take a 
minute.” Silence and pain. “Now, 
I want you to tell me if you can 
see anything at all, Sam. Any 
light? Even a flicker when I pass 
the light over your face?” 

Light? Groden stared into the 
painful blackness. There was 
nothing, nothing at all, neither 
light nor flicker nor motion. He 
said through the lips that were 
still tingling marble, “No.” 

The voice was disappointed. 
“All right, Sam. I’ll stop the pain 
in a minute.” Another voice 
farther away was saying some- 
thing about getting stowed away 
for the jump and the voice that 
had talked to Groden said im- 
patiently, “Just a minute.” 



Groden licked the marble lips 
and tried to say, “What did you 
mean, lost? What’s the matter?” 
But it came out a blur. The voice 
said something short and insin- 
cerely reassuring, and then there 
was a special pricking tingle in 
his arm, and even the voices were 
dark. 

“CECURE,” ordered the Cap- 
tain, and the Exec relayed 
the word through the speaking 
tubes: “Secure!” One by one the 
sections reported in on their tubes 
— All secure. 

The Captain had taken the 
conn himself, and he had the 
bridge on the jump. Lieutenant 
Yoel was backing up the helms- 
man, the navigator Ciccarelli was 
staring dubiously at the whirling 
stars, Ensign Lorch was hustling 
along the light-up detail, as they, 
with painstaking slowness, ad- 
justed the hollow wicks in the 
running lamps. The odor of kero- 
sene filled the bridge. 

“All secure, sir,” the Exec re- 
ported. 

The Captain said curtly, “Kill 
the spin.” The Exec gave the or- 
der to the jetroom; there was a 
distant barking rattle, and the 
bridge complement, like standing 
wheat in gusty wind, staggered 
and caught itself. The spinning 
stars outside jerked unevenly to 
a stop as the ship steadied on its 
axis.

Lorch cast a quick look around. 
The chronometers were wound 
and synchronized; the kerosene 
lamps burning brightly. He 
saluted the Exec and reported all 
clear. The Exec nodded gravely 
and passed the word on to the 
Captain — all of a yard away. 

The Captain said, “Take us 
up, Hal.” 

“Yes, sir. Number One circuits 
open!” 

The watch officer relayed into 
the speaking tube: “Number One 
circuits open!” There was a 
flicker, and abruptly all of the 
fluorescent lights were out. Only 
the kerosene lamps illuminated 
the bridge, or any of the ship. 

“Number Two open,” said the 
Exec. 

“Open Number Two!” Yoel 
echoed into the tube. From all 
over the ship the distant drone 
of motors, fans and refrigerators 
and boosters and burners deep- 
ened and died. 

“Main circuit breakers open.” 
That was only a precaution. 
Every electric current in the ship 
had ceased to flow; but in the 
off-chance that something, some- 
where, still was drawing juice, 
the mains themselves were open- 
ed. Terra I had taught that les- 
son very well; electronic flow and 
the hyperspace field did not mix. 

The Exec, looking a little gray, 
said, “Stand by to jump.” 

“Stand by!” Yoel sang into the 




14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



generator-room tube. The far- 
away moan of the nucleophoretic 
generators shook everyone in the 
ship; even on the bridge, they 
could feel their subsonic grind 
and hear the rumble of the Diesels 
that drove them. 

The Exec was rapidly scanning 
his panel of instruments, his lips 
moving. Everyone on the bridge 
could see his lips move, and knew 
what he was doing; making sure 
he had the readings memorized. 
Once in hyperspace, it would not 
be precisely impossible for him 
to read them, but it wouldn’t be 
reliable. 

At the feeler chart table where 
the Celestial Atlas should have 
been standing, Recorder Mate 
Nancy Eklund stood with her 
fingers on the pits and ridges that 
represented the coded course 
analyses. Like the Exec, she was 
doing her best to memorize them, 
in the last moments before vision 
became unreliable and instru- 
ments began to lie; it was her 
last chance to see them as a 
whole. 

The Exec had its eyes on the 
big chronometer. As the second 
hand touched straight-up, he 
said, “Jump!” 

Far away, the Diesels com- 
plained, as the generators clutch- 
ed in. The ship shimmered and 
glowed. A high, thin beep sound- 
ed from nowhere. Outside the 
crystal port the universe of stars 



flickered and whirled into new 
and fantastic shapes. 

And, half the ship away in the 
sick bay, Lieutenant Groden 
screamed shrilly. 

"CONSIGN Lorch tried shutting 
his eyes, but the flaming pin- 
wheels had left scars of blank- 
ness on the visual purple of his 
retina. He blinked to clear away 
the darting after-images. When 
he opened them again, the images 
were gone, and lashing serpen- 
tines of light peered ferociously 
in the port. The writhing snakes 
squirmed away and the planet 
Earth lay before him, green and 
inviting. 

It was only an illusion, but it 
was an illusion the whole bridge 
saw at once. Lorch looked away 
and heard the voice of Nancy 
Eklund, droning her course co- 
ordinates to be repeated by the 
Exec. 

Illusion, illusion — only the 
voices were real. It had to do, 
Lorch thought fuzzily through 
the wonder, with light speeds and 
partial radiation vectors and null- 
polarity; but the words meant 
nothing when the reality was be- 
fore his eyes. 

“C” became infinite and finite 
at once, creepingly slow and im- 
measurably fast. Light trapped 
on the outer surface of the port 
crept through to them at last, 
movement appeared fast or slow

or reversed, or irrelevant to its 
real components. 

He could see the Captain, stolid 
and transfixed like a bronze man 
— but was he? Or was that mo- 
tionless metal figure really leap- 
ing about the bridge, and what 
Lorch’s eyes beheld only the im- 
age of a split-second, captured 
and pinned? He could see the nav- 
igator, Ciccarelli, floating dream- 
ily a yard above the floor; that 
was illusion and symbol, for the 
little magnets in their shoes made 
it impossible. But what reality, 
translated, did it represent? 

Light and electrons. In hyper- 
space, they lied. 

“Number Six, Number Ten,” 
droned the Exec, echoing the Li- 
brary. “Full reverse.” The voices 
did not lie; the grosser physical 
phenomena were immune to the 
distortion of Riemann’s continu- 
um. What they heard was what 
was there to hear. What Nancy 
Eklund felt with her fingers was 
real. Lorch saw, or seemed to see, 
that the Exec had his finger on 
the pulse in his own wrist, tim- 
ing their jets-on periods by his 
heartbeat. 

The spring-driven chronometer 
across the bridge was clearly vis- 
ible and undoubtedly telling the 
correct time. But the light that 
carried its message might lie, and 
the fingers that touched his pulse 
would not. “Off jets!” droned the 
Exec. 

THE MAPMAKERS 



TTTHEY hung there. This was 
-*■ what Ciccarelli and the Exec 
and the Old Man had worked out 
— lacking the Atlas, lacking Gro- 
den — working only from their 
memories of the course that had 
brought them into the meteorite’s 
orbit and the sketchy notes the 
Captain himself had made. 

If they had remembered every- 
thing with the eidetic recollec- 
tion of Eklund or the Atlas; if 
they had every component cor- 
rect, and could stay on course 
for the proper period before halt- 
ing their flight; they might — 
might — come out where they had 
started, and from there easily 
find their way home. 

There was motion and activity 
on the bridge while they waited; 
and Lorch observed that Cicca- 
relli had kicked loose his shoes 
to float high enough off the steel 
floor to touch the hands of the 
chronometer. If he was floating 
now, thought Lorch, it was no 
•lie of the light. And was what he 
had seen a moment before the 
image of now, received before it 
was sent? 

They waited, and asked them- 
selves such demented questions, 
while Terra II described the com- 
plex curve that passed for a Rie- 
mannian straight line, and the 
Exec thoughtfully counted his 
heartbeats. 

Then: “Full jets, One, Four, 
Five Main,” snapped the Exec. 

17 



The ship bucked and shuddered. 

And then it was over, and they 
came “down” out of hyperspace, 
down into the normal space-time 
frame that held their own sun 
and their own planet. They had 
backtracked, as near as could be, 
every component of their course. 
And they had come out. 

They stared wordlessly at the 
stars, until the Captain said brisk- 
ly, “Belay that. Take a fix, Mr. 
Ciccarelli!” And down in the sick- 
bay, little Conboy, able once more 
to trust his vision, was rapidly as- 
sembling a hypodermic. But as 
he turned to his patient, he saw 
that it wasn’t necessary; Groden, 
who had been mumbling and cry- 
ing out throughout the jump in- 
to hyperspace, was out cold again. 

ICCARELLI put down his 
abacus. 

“No position, sir,” he said 
throatily to the Captain. “We’ve 
checked everything down to third 
magnitude.” 

The Old Man’s chin went up a 
degree of arc, but that was all. 
“All right,” he said. “Keep go- 
ing.” 

“We’ll try, sir,” Ciccarelli prom- 
ised. “I’ll get right to work on 
the faint ones.” 

The Captain nodded and 
walked delicately, almost minc- 
ingly in the light spin-gravity, 
away. Commander Broderick 
from the surgeon’s office down the 



corridor replaced him. He was 
staring after the Captain, as he 
came into the navigation room. 

“If I were the Old Man,” he 
said thoughtfully, “I would still 
be here.” 

“Maybe that’s why you aren’t 
the Old Man.” Ciccarelli wearily 
leaned over his crewman’s shoul- 
der to scan the rough log. 

“Maybe,” Broderick agreed. 
“Still, what’s he going to do back 
on the bridge? Go through this 
same routine again? Make an- 
other jump and see where we 
come out? Might work, I don’t 
deny it. Given infinite time and 
infinite fuel and a couple of other 
infinites, sooner or later we’d 
come out right spang in the mid- 
dle of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.” 
“Tell him your troubles,” Cic- 
carelli said shortly. “How’s Gro- 
den?” 

“He’ll live. If any of us do.” 
“That,” said Ciccarelli, pick- 
ing up the completed sheaf of 
observations from his crewman, 
“is a pretty long shot, Doc.” 

The Captain, in his own mind, 
would have agreed with Cicca- 
relli. He walked soberly, unswerv- 
ingly, down the galleyways to- 
ward the bridge, ticking off the 
posibilities with a part of his 
brain while the big, deep area that 
might been labeled “officer’s 
country” was making careful 
note of the ship’s condition. 

The fuel and food reserves

would outlast the air; and Brod- 
erick’s sick-bay was an Asiatic 
mess. Lacking the Atlas’s data 
and Groden’s skill on the bridge, 
it would take a miracle to get 
them home; and Spaceman-Sec- 
ond Kerkam was out of uniform. 

The enlisted women’s quarters 
needed floor-polishing; and the 
mind of no three-dimensional ani- 
mal could, by definition, grasp 
the geodesics of Riemannian 
space. It was a matter of trial 
and error and record, and all 
you could hope to do was retrace 
a course once you had found one 
that brought you somewhere 
worth being. It was, he reflected 
with mild distaste, a shoddy way 
to run a spaceship. 

R ecorder Mate Ekiund, 

having ducked into the en- 
listed women’s area scant yards 
ahead of the Captain, sighed to 
her bunkmate, “Thank heaven! 
I thought he was coming in here!” 
“Did you have a rough time 
on the bridge?” her bunkmate 
asked sympathetically. 

“No, not that. But he’s a fish, 
Julia. He was just standing there, 
not looking scared or anything, 
and all the time we were going 
straight to — straight to goodness 
knows where. He doesn’t know 
what to do,” she added bitterly. 
“None of them do.” 

“You think we’re lost?” 

“Think it? Honey, I know it.” 



She sat down and complained, 
“I’ve got a headache.” 

“I wouldn’t be surprised,” her 
bunkmate said warmly. “Here, 
let me get you a cup of tea.” 
Nancy Ekiund said doubtfully, 
“Do you think you should? Ev- 
ery time you boil water, it’s just 
that much more heat. And — ” 
“Now let me worry about that,” 
said Julia. “You’re a pretty im- 
portant person on this ship, and 
you’ve got to keep yourself in 
good shape.” 

The Library let herself be per- 
suaded easily enough, though she 
had an idea that her bunkmate 
had an ulterior motive or two. 
But she did have a headache and 
she was tired. 

And it was true that on the 
bridge during a jump, she was 
about the most important per- 
son aboard. 

It was a duty that Nancy 
hated, though, important or not. 
She thanked her lucky stars that 
most of the time she was in a 
trance state and not able to ob- 
serve, for instance, what the dis- 
tortions of hyperspace were doing 
to her own personal appearance. 
But it was finicking, wearing 
work, even in a trance state. Some 
of it was bound to seep through 
to the conscious level, however 
distorted, and she had been hav- 
ing dreams about hyperspace 
courses, fixes and triangulation 
points.

Julia came back with the tea 
and Nancy Eklund said, “I’m 
sorry to be always complaining. 
Heaven knows it’s no worse than 
we had a right to expect. We 
knew this was dangerous when 
we signed up for it.” 

“But we didn’t know we’d 
sweat ourselves to death, Nancy! 
We didn’t expect this eternal 
should-I-light-the-lights, should- 
I-boil-some-coffee. Honestly, I 
don’t mind dying half as much as 
I mind being nibbled to death by 
one little annoyance after anoth- 
er!” She glanced speculatively at 
the other girl, and in a different 
tone said, “I guess you’re pretty 
tired—” 

Nancy Eklund 1 sat up and 
stared at her. “Julia! You can’t 
want me to go on with that hor- 
rible story.” 

“Not if you don’t feel up to 
it,” her bunkmate said humbly. 
“But it passes the time — if you 
aren’t too hoarse.” 

“Well, no.” Nancy took a sip 
of tea. “I was receiving, not put- 
ting out,” she said professionally. 
“I suppose if you really want — ” 
“Index!” said Julia triumphant- 
ly, not waiting for her to change 
her mind. As Nancy Eklund, at 
the cue word, slumped into the 
trance state, Julia caught the 
cup of tea before it spilled. “Fic- 
tion!” she said, and went on to 
give the author’s name, the title 
and the chapter of the mystery 



she had been “reading.” She set- 
tled back happily as the Library 
took up the story again. 

It wasn’t, Julia told herself, 
as if it really mattered. After 
all, there wasn’t anything for 
Nancy or anyone else to do, un- 
til the geniuses in navigation and 
computation had figured out 
where they were. And that would 
probably take days. 

T>UT she was wrong. In the 
-■-'wardroom, Commander Brod- 
erick was brooding over a bowl 
of coffee, half watching a bridge 
game, when Ciccarelli walked in. 
He looked tired; he didn’t even 
wait for anyone to ask; he vol- 
unteered, “Yeah, yeah, we have 
a position. It isn’t good.” 

“Pretty far?” one of the card 
players asked wistfully. 

Ciccarelli nodded, unsmiling. 
“Pretty far. We got our fix by 
triangulating on extra-galactic 
nebulae, which will give you an 
idea. I make it — ” he glanced at 
them under his eyebrows — “bet- 
ter than fifteen thousand light- 
years from Sol.” 

Ensign Lorch picked up the 
cards and began to deal them au- 
tomatically; there wasn’t any- 
thing much else to do. But his 
mind was not very completely on 
bridge. 

Fifteen thousand light-years 
from Sol. 

In hyperspace, he thought, it 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



might have been a voyage only 
of minutes. Outside of the three 
dimensions in which humans live 
their normal lives, distances are 
a matter of cosmic whim. Alde- 
baran and Betelgeuse, in hyper- 
space, may almost touch; Luna 
and the Earth may be infinities 
apart. 

Lorch, staring unseeing at his 
cards, licked his lips. They had 
cruised around in hyperspace for 
a few hours of actual “jump” 
time before the meteorite had 
struck. And they had found them- 
selves perhaps a thousand light- 
years from Earth, perhaps less. 
They had backtracked moment 
for moment, as well as they could 
figure, the same course — and their 
new position was a dozen times 
as far. 

That was the nature of hyper- 
space. Line A-B in Newton’s uni- 
verse might be more than line 
A-B in Riemann’s, or it might 
be less, but it was never the same. 
And the distances, Lorch thought 
cloudily, might not even be com- 
mutative; A-B plus B-C might 
not be, probably was not, the 
same as B-C plus A-B. That was 
why the Atlas, with his infinite 
stored checkpoints and positions, 
had a place on the bridge . 

“Bid, for God’s sake,” someone 
was saying impatiently. 

Lorch shook himself. “I’m sor- 
ry,” he said, focusing on his cards. 
“Say, isn’t it getting hot?” 



Nobody answered. 

They wouldn’t, thought Com- 
mander Broderick, lowering into 
his bowl of cold coffee. Hot? Sure 
it’s getting hot. Not starvation, 
not thirst, not suffocation — heat. 
That was the spaceman’s enemy, 
that was what would kill them all. 

1? VERY time one of the crew 
drew a breath, carbon in his 
body oxidized and gave off heat. 
Every time the rocket jets blasted, 
heat seeped from the tubes into 
the frame of the ship. Every 
time the Diesels that drove the 
nucleophoretic generators cough- 
ed and spun, or the cooks fried an 
egg, or a spaceman lit a cigarette, 
there was heat. 

Take a hot poker, Broderick 
suggested meditatively to himself. 
You can watch it glow red and 
lose heat that way — that is ra- 
diation. You can wave it in the 
air and let the breeze carry the 
heat away — that is convection. 
Or you can quench it in a bucket 
of oil — and that is conduction. 
And those are the only ways there 
are, in Newton’s space or Rie- 
mann’s, of taking heat from one 
body and giving it to another. 
And in vacuum, the latter two 
did not operate, for lack of mat- 
ter to operate with. 

Radiation, thought Broderick, 
radiation would work. A pity 
we’re not red hot. 

If they had been at a tempera- 



THE MAPMAKERS

ture of a thousand degrees, they 
would have cooled quite rapidly. 
But at a temperature of perhaps 
25° Centigrade, average through 
Terra II’s hull, radiation was 
minute. The loss through radia- 
tion was more, much more, than 
made up through internal heat 
sources, and so the heat of the 
ship, hour by hour, climbed. 

It had been a long time, Brod- 
erick remembered, since he had 
heard the hiss of expanding air. 
That was how one coped with 
heat. From the pressurized parts 
of the ship, valve off air, the ex- 
pansion cools, the cooling takes 
heat from the rest of the ship. 
Replace the air from the high- 
pressure tanks, and there’s more 
than enough air in the tanks for 
any imaginable hyperspace voy- 
age, since none can conceivably 
last more than a few weeks — and 
that’s that. 

“Sir,” a voice said, and Brod- 
erick realized that the voice had 
said it before. It was a messenger, 
saluting respectfully. 

“What is it?” he growled. 

“Surgeon Mate Conboy,” the 
messenger recited crisply, “asks 
if you can step down to the sick- 
bay. Lieutenant Groden is cut- 
ting up.” 

“All right, all right,” said 
Broderick, and waved the mes- 
senger away. Groden, he thought, 
what’s the use of worrying about 
Groden? He’ll cook as well as 



any of us, on this handsomely 
adventurous hyperspace cruise 
that cannot conceivably last more 
than a few weeks. 

“You trumped my trick!” 
howled Ensign Lorch’s partner 
as the surgeon was leaving. Lorch 
blinked and stared. 

“Sorry,” he said automatically, 
then bent and looked closer. “I’ve 
only got two cards,” he said. 
“Why does the dummy still have 
five?” 

Ill

took it as a joke. She looked 
at herself in the mirror and told 
her friend Julia, “I think it’s quite 
nice. I don’t see why we don’t 
do it all the time.” 

“You’ve got the figure for it,” 
Julia said glumly, comparing her 
own dumpy silhouette with the 
other girl’s. These issue-bathing 
suits weren’t particularly flatter- 
ing either, she told herself re- 
sentfully, knowing in her heart 
that the fabric had never been 
loomed to flatter her figure the 
way it did Nancy Eklund’s. 
“Bathing suits,” she said irritat- 
edly. “Oh, why did I ever sign 
on for this?” 

Recorder Mate Ekiund patted 
her arm and jauntily stepped out 
into the corridor. The male mem- 
bers of the crew were wearing 
trunks by now, too. She felt more 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



as though she were at some rath- 
er crowded beach than aboard 
Terra II. Except that it was so 
hot. 

Not only had the uniform of 
the day been changed to the bare 
minimum, but there had been 
other changes in the ship’s rou- 
tine. No more spinning the ship 
for gravity, for instance. The mag- 
netic-soled shoes were issued for 
everyone now, because spinning 
the ship took rocket power, and 
rocket power meant more heat 
that they couldn’t get rid of. The 
magnet shoes were all right, but 
it did take a certain amount of 
concentration to remember heel- 
and-toe-and-lean, heel-and-toe- 
and-lean, in a sort of bent-over 
half trot like the one that Groucho 
Marx had once, long before Nan- 
cy’s time, made famous. 

She loped crouching into the 
Captain’s quarters, saluted and 
took her place. It was getting a 
little wearisome, she thought de- 
tachedly. Everything anybody 
said, it seemed, they wanted 
recorded in her brain, and nobody 
ever seemed to take a breath with- 
out demanding some part of the 
stored knowledge recited back 
to hipi. Still, when she was re- 
cording she was, in effect, asleep; 
she woke up slightly refreshed, 
though there were some confus- 
ing dreams. 

She wondered absently, for a 
moment, just what she did know. 



in the part of her mind where 
the records were kept, the part 
that was available only to out- 
siders on presentation of the cue 
words, and never to her. 

But by then the other officers 
had arrived, and the Captain 
snapped, "Records,” and she 
slumped back. Not quite all the 
way back — just enough so that 
the natural tensions in the great 
muscles of the back and thighs 
reached a point of equilibrium — 
and, in the non-gravity of the 
still ship, her sleeping body, 
moored by the magnets at the 
feet, floated like Mahomet’s Tomb 
above the chair. 

Ensign Lorch felt the Captain’s 
eyes on him and hastily looked 
away from the Library. Good- 
looking kid, though, he thought; 
this strip-down business had its 
advantages. Too bad the other 
women in the crew weren’t more 
like her. 

T HE meeting lasted an hour 
by the chronometer, as had 
each meeting of each of the pre- 
vious eleven days. And it accom- 
plished as much as its eleven 
predecessors. 

“Summing up, then,” the Cap- 
tain said savagely. “One, we can’t 
jump home because we don’t 
know the way; two, we can’t jet 
home through normal space be- 
cause we don’t have the fuel or 
air; three, we can’t stay where we

are because we’ll roast. Is that 
it?” 

The Exec said, “That’s it, sir. 
We might set down on another 
planet, though.” 

“A planet nearby?” The Cap- 
tain thought that over. “What 
about it, Ciccarelli?” 

The navigator shrugged. “If we 
can find one, sir. I’d say the 
chances were poor. We’ve got 
very little in the way of fuel re- 
serve. Every jump uses up a lit- 
tle, and — well, if we come out 
of a jump within, let’s say, a 
tenth of a light-year of a habit- 
able planet, pretty nearly at rel- 
ative rest to it, we might be able 
to make it. We’ve got maybe one 
chance in a thousand of that.” 
Commander Broderick said, 
“Sir, this is just a wild notion, 
but suppose we did one of those 
things they’re always doing in 
the movies, you know? Freeze the 
whole ship’s crew in suspended 
animation. I believe I could man- 
age something like that out of 
the medical supplies, if we could 
only bring the temperature low 
enough — ” 

“That’s just what we can’t do,” 
said the Captain. 

“Yes, sir,” Broderick agreed. 
“But if we did that, we could 
valve off a lot of air — maybe 
enough to cool the ship. Nobody 
would be breathing, you see. And 
we could rig up some sort of 
alarm for when we got there. 



Wouldn’t matter if it was years 
— even centuries; there would be 
a vacuum, and no specimen de- 
terioration — I mean, nothing hap- 
pening to us.” 

Ciccarelli said mulishly, “Im- 
possible. It’s the question of rel- 
ative rest again. We haven’t got 
enough fuel to mess around. Sup- 
pose we found Sol, and pointed 
right for it. By the time we got 
there, where would it be? And 
how fast would it be going, in 
what direction? Maybe you can 
tell. I can’t.” 

T> RODERICK crouched discon- 
solately back into his sick- 
bay, and the enlisted man he’d 
left behind looked up in relief. 
“It’s Groden, sir,” he said at 
once. “He’s been acting up.” 

Ensign Lorch, behind Broder- 
ick, hesitated in the doorway. 
“Acting up?” demanded Broder- 
ick. 

“Yes, sir. I gave him another 
needle, but it didn’t take effect. I 
guess it was delirium, sir. Took 
three ampoules — ” 

The voices trailed off as they 
went inside. Lorch made himself 
comfortable — not an easy job in 
non-gravity, that is if you . were 
a commissioned officer and con- 
cerned about smart appearance. 

The two medics were gone for 
a long time, and when Com- 
mander Broderick came out again 
he looked worried. “Sorry, Lorch,” 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he apologized. He felt the pres- 
sure-pot of coffee on the little 
stove and made a face. “Want 
some?” 

Lorch shook his head. “Too 
much trouble to drink.” 

“Don’t blame you.” But Brod- 
erick carefully coaxed a couple 
of ounces of the stuff into a trans- 
parent plastic bulb, teased sugar 
and cream in after it, spun the 
bulb with his thumb over the 
opening to stir it, took a sip. “I 
don’t like it,” he brooded over 
his coffee. “Groden’s working up 
real damage, the kind I can’t 
handle.” 

Lorch asked curiously, “What 
kind is that?” 

“Inside his head. I had to tell 
him that his sight was gone, un- 
less we can get to an eye bank 
within ten days. The optic nerves, 
Lorch — you can patch in an eye, 
but once the nerve has degener- 
ated you can’t replace it. And 
he took it hard.” 

“Yelled and cut up?” 

“Worse than that,” said Brod- 
erick. “He didn’t say a word. 
Now, I know that man’s in pain; 
the scars around his eyes are 
pretty bad. I gave him a couple 
of pills to knock out the nerve 
centers, but Conboy found them 
under his pillow. He wouldn’t 
take them, and he wouldn’t make 
a sound — until he fell asleep, and 
then he damn near woke up the 
ship. Conboy must have given 



him fifty ampoules by now — too 
much of the stuff. But we can’t 
have him screaming. He’s pun- 
ishing himself, Lorch.” 

“For what?” 

“Who knows for what? If I 
could put him through an E.E.S., 
I might be able to find out. But 
how can you run an electroen- 
cephaloscope on a tub like this? 
I’m lucky they let me have an 
X-ray.” 

Lorch said, perhaps a touch 
too drily, “What did doctors do 
before they had those gadgets? 
Shoot the patients?” 

It made Broderick look at him 
thoughtfully. “No,” he said after 
a second. “Of course not. With 
luck, I could run a verbal anal- 
ysis on him, and I might pick 
some of the key stuff out of the 
sludge in, oh, four or five months. 
That’s what they did before they 
had the E.E.S. And now let’s get 
busy, mister.” 

The two of them worked over 
an inventory of Broderick’s medi- 
cine chest, because even though 
the idea of putting the whole 
ship’s crew in suspended anima- 
tion was ridiculous and impos- 
sible and contra-regs besides — 
what else was there? 

And it kept getting hotter. 

VEN Groden felt it. 

He called reasonably to who- 
ever was near, “Please do what 
I ask. Put things back the way 




THE MAPMAKERS

they were, please. Please do it!” 
He said it many times, many 
different ways. But his tongue 
was fat black velvet and his 
mouth an enormous cave ; he 
couldn’t feel the words, couldn’t 
feel his tongue against his cheeks 
or teeth. That was the needles 
they kept sticking him with, he 
told himself. “Please,” he said, 
“no more needles.” 

But he wasn’t getting through. 

Groden relaxed. He forced him- 
self to relax, and it wasn’t easy. 
His body was all wrong; it hurt 
in places, and felt nothing in 
places, and — were those feelings 
at his waist and shoulders and 
legs the touch of restraining belts? 
He couldn’t tell. 

He was lying on his back, he 
was pretty sure. At least, the 
voices seemed to come from 
points in the plane of his body, 
as well as he could locate them. 
But if he was lying on his back, 
he asked himself, why didn’t he 
feel pressure on his back? Or 
pressure anywhere? Could the 
ship be in free-fall — all this 
length of time? Impossible, he 
told himself. 

He went back to relaxing. 

The thing was to keep from 
panic. If you were physically 
relaxed, you couldn’t panic. That 
was what they had taught at the 
Academy, and it was true. Only 
they hadn’t taught the converse, 
he thought bitterly; they hadn’t 



said that when you were in panic 
it was impossible to relax. 

No. That’s not the way to go 
about it, he told himself. Relax. 
Occupy your mind with — with — 
well, occupy your mind with 
something. Take inventory, for 
instance. 

One, it’s hot. There was no 
doubt of that. 

Two, something was pressing 
against his body at various points. 
It felt like restraining belts. 

Three, voices came and talked 
to him. Damned dirty lying 
voices that — He caught himself 
just in time. 

Four, he said to himself, four, 
somebody keeps sticking needles 
into me. 

It was the needles, he thought 
wretchedly, that made everything 
else so bad. Maybe the needles 
caused everything else. With crav- 
en hope he told himself : Sure, the 
needles; they’re sticking me full 
of drugs; naturally I’m having 
delusions. Who wouldn’t? I’m 
lucky if I don’t turn into a hop- 
head if I get out of this — 

When I get out of this, he cor- 
rected himself, whimpering. 

He wondered whether he was 
crying. 

Of course, if those lying voices 
were, by some chance, not lying, 
then he couldn’t be crying. Be- 
cause he wouldn’t have any eyes 
to cry with. And, he told himself 
reasonably, there wasn’t much 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



doubt that the voices were plaus- 
ible. He had been injured some- 
where around his eyes; he had 
felt the pain, and it was too in- 
tense and specific to be unreal. 
That was in the old days — how 
long ago they were, he could not 
begin to imagine — when there had 
been only a few needles now and 
then, and even if he did have a 
little trouble moving and talking, 
he was still in perfect posses- 
sion of his faculties. 

All right, he thought. So I 
was injured around the eyes. 

But the rest — that was a 

damned lie. He had even believed 
if for a while — when the Brod- 
erick-voice said, with hypocriti- 
cal sympathy, that he wouldn’t 
be able to see anything, ever, un- 
less they got him new corpse’s 
eyes out of an eye bank on Earth. 
It had been a blow, but he be- 
lieved it. Until, he reminded him- 
self triumphantly, he had seen! 
Seen as clearly as he knew the 
voices were lying, that was when 
he began to suspect the existence 
of the whole horrible senseless 
plot. 

“No!” he screamed. “Please, 
please — no!” But they couldn’t 
be hearing him, because they were 
going right on with another 
needle; he could feel it. Furiously 
he fought to pull back the alien 
arm, make the marble lips move, 
the black velvet tongue speak, 
“Please—" 

THE MAPMAKERS 



AN the bridge, the Captain was 
” staring fixedly at the alien 
stars. It was a measure of his 
state of mind that he was on the 
bridge at all, at a time when the 
ship was going nowhere and there 
was nothing to be done beyond 
the routine. 

He leaned forward in his chair, 
jerking free the little magnets 
sewn into the waist of his trunks, 
and walked heel-and-toe across 
the bridge. The little Recorder 
Mate, Eklund or whatever her 
name was, was standing humbly 
in a corner, waiting for him to 
tell her why he had sent for her. 
But, the Captain confessed to 
himself, the trouble was he didn’t 
exactly know why himself. And, 
after all, why should he? It was 
so damned hot — 

Belay that kind of talk, he told 
himself. He said: “Eklund! In- 
dex.” The girl’s eyes closed like 
the snapping of a shutter. 

“Take over,” the Captain or- 
dered the Exec. “Run her through 
the Riemannian configurations 
again. We’ll get every bit of dope 
she has.” And they would, he 
knew. Because they had already. 

And none of it helped. 

IV 

TT was a good thing, Ensign 
-*■ Lorch told himself, sweating, 
that spaceships were not painted. 
Otherwise he would surely have 

27 



been set to commanding a crew 
chipping paint. 

Terra II being welded of un- 
painted metal, the color a part 
of the alloy itself, his crew was 
defluffing the filter traps in the 
air circulators. It was a job for 
idiots, planned by morons; it 
took six men five hours to dis- 
assemble the air trunks and the 
junction boxes, five minutes to 
blow out the collected fluff on the 
static accumulators, five hours to 
put them back together again. 
There was an alternative method, 
which involved burning them 
clean with a high-voltage arc; 
that took one man slightly under 
three seconds. But that, the Exec 
had decreed, meant heat. 

And heat was the enemy. 

Of course, there was still a 
third alternative, which was to 
leave the fluff in the filter traps 
undisturbed. This would have 
generated no heat at all. But it 
also would have taken no time and 
occupied no personnel, which 
were decisive counts against it 
in the eyes of the Exec. A little 
fluff in the filters would make no 
conceivable difference to the op- 
eration of the ship, but idle men 
might make a very great differ- 
ence indeed. 

“Hurry it up,” growled Ensign 
Lorch. The men didn’t even look 
at him. Lorch looked around him 
self-consciously. As an officer, he 
had made inspection tours in the 



enlisted women’s quarters before, 
but he couldn’t help feeling out 
of place and slightly apprehen- 
sive. 

That girl, the Recorder Mate — 
Eklund was her name — was dron- 
ing all the parts of Cyrano de 
Bergerac to an audience in the 
far end of the lounge, and parts 
of Cyrano’s farewell to Roxanne 
kept mixing in with Lorch’s 
thoughts. 

It didn’t matter; he wasn’t 
thinking to any purpose, anyhow. 
Neither he nor anyone else on 
Terra II, he told himself bitterly. 
Fifteen thousand light-years. The 
light that came to them from 
Sol — how weak and faint! — had 
been bright summer sunlight 
beating down on the skin tents of 
Neolithic Man creeping north- 
ward after the retreating ice. And 
the light from the nearest stars 
beyond Terra IT s skin, contrari- 
wise, would fall on an Earth in- 
conceivably advanced, a planet of 
mental Titans . 

“Mister Lorch,” someone was 
repeating plaintively. 

The ensign shook himself and 
focused on the spaceman waver- 
ing before him. “Eh?” 

“We’re done,” the man repeat- 
ed. “It’s all put together again. 
The filter traps,” he explained. 

“Oh,” said Ensign Lorch. He 
glanced self-consciously at the 
women at the far end of the 
lounge, but they were absorbed 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in Rostand’s love story. There was 
a murmur of gossip from them — 
“so all at once I knew there was 
somebody looking at me. Well, 
I called the duty officer and we 
searched, but — ” 

Ensign Lorch cleared his throat. 
“Well done,” he said absently. 
“Dismissed.” He turned his back 
on the detail and propelled him- 
self down the passageway toward 
the sickbay. 

TF he went back to the bridge, 
*■ the Old Man would find work 
for him; if he went to the ward- 
room, the Exec would find an 
excuse to send him to the Old 
Man. And his own quarters were 
horribly, stifling hot. 

He accosted the Ship’s Surgeon 
and demanded, “How long are 
we expected to live in this heat?” 
Commander Broderick said ir- 
ritably, “How should I know? 
You don’t die of the heat, that’s 
sure. There are other things that 
will come first — suffocation, 
thirst, maybe even starvation.” 
Lorch looked thoughtful at 
the medical officer. Red-eyed, his 
face lined with worry and weari- 
ness, Broderick was showing 
strain. Through his scanty shorts, 
you could see the fishbelly white- 
ness of his skin; it was old man’s 
skin, and Broderick, for all of 
his passing the annual fitness ex- 
am, was getting on toward being 
an old man. 



Lorch said more gently, “I 
guess you’re getting a rough 
time all around.” 

“Good Lord, am I!” the sur- 
geon snapped. “Half the ship’s 
complement has been in here to- 
day — little fiddling things like 
prickly heat and dizzy spells. 
Dizzy spells! How the devil can 
anyone not have dizzy spells? 
The women’s quarters have prac- 
tically a regular courier service. 
If it isn’t anti-perspirants, it’s 
salt tablets; if it isn’t salt tab- 
lets, it’s alcohol from the ship’s 
store for rubdowns.” He passed 
his hand shakily over his eyes. 
“Then,” he said, “to top it all 
off, there’s him.” He pointed to 
the inner chamber of the sick- 
bay. Lorch, listening, could hear 
the blinded Groden’s rasping 
breath. 

There was a shrill whistle from 
the speaking tube, then, tinnily, 
a voice from the bridge. “Com- 
mander Broderick! Captain re- 
quests you report to the bridge 
at once.” 

The Surgeon blinked and 
swore. “How the devil am I sup- 
posed to do that?” he demanded. 
“Two of my crewmen are out 
with heat prostration, and the 
other two were working all night. 
All right, I go up to the bridge. 
Suppose there’s some trouble? 
Suppose Groden starts acting up 
again?” He stared irresolutely at 
the speaking tube. 



THE MAPMAKERS

Lorch said thoughtfully, “Say, 
Commander, could I keep an eye 
on him for you?” 

It was a fine idea. Broderick 
took off for the bridge and Lorch, 
hastily briefed on the simple 
task of sticking a new needle in 
Groden’s arm if he showed any 
signs of trouble, bade him a care- 
ful good-by and waited until he 
was well out of sight before, whis- 
tling, he knelt before the Cabinet 
of emergency medical supplies. 

Broderick had given him an 
idea. And, he told himself bliss- 
fully, moments later, it had been 
a good one. Alcohol rub! Now why 
hadn’t he thought of that him- 
self? 

He hardly noticed that Gro- 
den’s heavy breathing had 
changed pitch and character. It 
almost formed words now. 

O N the bridge, the Captain was 
briefing the ship’s officers — 
all but Groden, in the sickbay, 
and Lorch, who, the Captain had 
agreed, was easily enough spared 
to watch after Groden — on what 
in his mind he called Project 
Desperation. It didn’t take much 
briefing, because it was the only 
thing left for them to do and 
every man on the ship knew it. 

“We have,” the Captain said 
precisely, “margin for just under 
forty minutes of rocket blast at 
standard thrust. That will bring 
our overall temperature up to 



60 °, give or take a degree, accord- 
ing to Engineering’s best guess. 
And that’s the maximum the hu- 
man body can stand — that’s right, 
Broderick?” 

The Surgeon quickly trans- 
lated into the Fahrenheit scale; 
a hundred and forty degrees or 
so. 

“That’s right, sir,” he said. “If 
we can stand that much,” he 
added reluctantly after a mo- 
ment. “It hits that on Earth in a 
couple of places — around the 
Dead Sea, Aden, places like that. 
But it isn’t sustained heat; it 
drops considerably after dark.” 

The Captain nodded somberly. 
“We’ll hope,” he said, “that we’ll 
find ourselves out of this before 
we hit sixty degrees. If we don’t 
— well, at least we won’t starve or 
suffocate. You understand, gentle- 
men, that the odds are against us. 
I suggested to Lieutenant Cicca- 
relli that it was a million-to-one 
shot. He said I was an optimist. 
But one chance in a million, or a 
billion, or whatever the number 
may be, is better than no chance 
at all. Do you all agree?” 

There was no answer. The Cap- 
tain went on, “Before we jump, 
I presume no one has a better 
idea?” No one had. “Thank you. 
Then, gentlemen, if you will as- 
sume your stations, we’ll get 
down to business. Stand by to 
jump.” 

The Captain took his place with 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



an air of benign detachment. It 
wasn’t a Captain’s job to take 
the conn of a ship in a perfectly 
routine maneuver. He watched 
approvingly as the Exec put the 
ship on alert, then on stand-by, 
then went through the checklist 
that culminated in the “jump” 
into hyperspace. 

The Captain was a model of 
placid, observant command of- 
ficership, but behind the placid 
face, the agitated mind was churn- 
ing out awful calculations. 

Consider the Galaxy, he was 
thinking to himself; a hundred 
thousand light-years broad, per- 
haps forty thousand through its 
axis. Call it a lens-shaped figure 
with a volume of three hundred 
trillion light-years. Say that their 
cruising radius, in normal space, 
was within a volume of one light- 
year ; that meant that the chances 
of their coming out, by accident, 
within cruising distance of Earth 
was — not one in a million, or 
one in a hundred million, or one 
in a billion . 

It was one chance in three hun- 
dred trillion. 

The Captain juggled the num- 
bers comfortably enough in his 
mind. They were absolutely 
meaningless, far too big to be 
comprehended or feared. 

THHERE it was, the beautiful 
Master Pattern. 

Groden lay tense and fearful, 



seeing it. It had been a long 
time since the last needle; by the 
only clock he owned, his heart- 
beat, it had been more than two 
hours since he discovered that he 
could move his lips and his fin- 
gers again. He had feverishly 
wondered why; and had dared 
not speak or move after the first 
trials for fear of bringing the 
needle again. But now he knew. 

There was the Master Pattern. 
He scanned it slowly in every 
part. There was the giant star- 
cluster of Hercules; and there 
the bridge of Terra II; there was 
the fat red disc of Betelgeuse; 
and there the shower room of the 
enlisted women’s quarters. He 
took in the ordered ranks of the 
constellations as easily as he 
noted that Broderick was gone 
from the sickbay, and in his place 
the young ensign, Lorch, was 
clinging with harried expression 
to a stanchion. They were in hy- 
perspace. Broderick was on the 
bridge. Lorch had been left in 
charge, and it had not occurred 
to him, since his patient had been 
so carefully quiet, to administer 
another needle. 

Groden carefully moved his 
hands, and found that they would 
do what he wanted. He was get- 
ting the hang of — well, it was not 
seeing, exactly, he confessed to 
himself. It was like being alone 
on a starless night, in the middle 
of a dark wood. It took time to

get used to the darkness, but by 
and by shapes would begin to 
make themselves known. 

It was not the same thing; this 
was no mere matter of the ex- 
panding pupil of the eye; but the 
effect was something the same. 
But explain it or not, he was be- 
coming able to use it; each time 
the beautiful vision was more 
complete, and therefore more 
beautiful. 



He found the straps that bound 
him, and unbuckled them. 

On the bridge, he “saw,” the 
jump at random was nearing its 
end. It would be only a matter 
of minutes before they were back 
in normal space, and he was blind 4 
again. 

In the outer room of the sick- 
bay, Ensign Lorch was staring 
dismally at the hallucinations of 
hyperspace. It was almost cer- 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tain, thought Groden to himself, 
that if Lorch was so fortunate 
as to see him at all, he would 
pass off the sight as another of 
the lies light told. The important 
thing was sound; he must not 
make a noise. 

He crept through the door, 
carefully holding to the guide 
rails. Broderick had been right 
about one thing, though, he ad- 
mitted — the pain. The wreck of 



his eyes no longer seemed as 
important, with the wonderful 
things hyperspace’s cloudless per- 
ception brought to him, but the 
shattered bone and tissue and 
nerve ends hurt. 

Algol’s dark primary occluded 
the radiant star for a second and 
confused him; they were moving 
faster than he had thought. He 
hastily scanned the Master Plan 
again, fearful for a second. But 



THE MAPMAKERS 



33 



there was Sol and its family of 
planets, and there was Earth. 
Terra II might be lost, but Lieu- 
tenant Groden was not, and if 
only he could get to the bridge. 

He scanned the bridge. It was 
later than he thought. He felt 
the vibrations in the floor as he 
realized that the jump was at an 
end. Panicked, he hesitated. 

Blackness again, and no more 
stars. 

He stood there, incredibly de-' 
solate, and the pain was sudden- 
ly more than he could bear. 

And from behind him he heard 
a startled yell, Lorch’s voice: 
“Hey, Groden! Come back here! 
What the devil are you doing out 
in the passage?’'’ 

It was the last straw. Groden 
had no tear ducts left with which 
to weep, but he did the best he 
could. 

TJRODERICK worked over the 
girl, Eklund, for a moment, 
and brought her to. She stared 
at him uncomprehendingly for a 
moment, but she was all right. As 
all right, he thought, as anyone 
on Terra II had any chance to 
be. 

“Plain heat prostration,” he 
reported to the Captain. “It’s 
been a pretty rough job for her, 
trying to keep on top of all this.” 

The Captain nodded unemo- 
tionally. “Well, Ciccarelli?” he 
demanded. 



The Navigator ran his hands 
through his hair. “No position, 
sir,” he said despondently. “May- 
be if I ran down the third and 
fourth magnitude stars — ” 

“Don’t bother,” the Captain 
said. “If we aren’t within a light- 
year of Sol, we’re too far to do us 
any good. At your convenience, 
gentlemen, we’ll take another 
jump.” 

The Exec nodded wearily and 
opened his mouth to give the 
order, but Broderick protested, 
“Sir, we’ll all be falling over if 
we don’t take a break. The tem- 
perature’s past forty-five now. 
The only way to handle it is fre- 
quent rests and plenty of liquids.” 
“Ten minutes be enough?” 

The surgeon hesitated. Then 
he shrugged. “Why not? No sense 
worrying about long-term effects 
just now, is there?” 

“There is not,” said the Cap- 
tain. “Make it so,” he ordered 
the Exec. 

The Captain half-closed his 
eyes, fanning himself mechani- 
cally. When the runner from the 
wardroom brought him his plas- 
tic globe of fruit juices he ac- 
cepted it and began to sip, but 
he wasn’t paying very much at- 
tention. He had the figures on 
the tip of his tongue: The first 
blind jump in Project Despera- 
tion had cost them sixteen min- 
utes of rocket time. He could be 
a little more conservative with 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the next one — maybe use only 
ten minutes. That way he could 
squeeze out at least one more 
full-length, or nearly full-length, 
jump; and then one last truly 
desperate try, not more than a 
minute or two. And if that didn’t 
work, they were cooked. 

Literally, he told himself wry- 
ly- 

In fact, he continued, counting 
up the entries in red ink on their 
ledger, they were just about out 
of luck now. For even if their 
next jump took them within cruis- 
ing distance of Earth, there was 
still the time factor to be con- 
sidered. They had left only 
twenty-four minutes of jet time 
before Terra II’ s hull tempera- 
ture passed the critical sixty- 
degree mark. 

True, he had maintained some 
slight reserve in that not all their 
expansible gas had been used. 
There remained a certain amount 
in the compressed tanks. And 
even beyond that, it would be 
possible to valve off some of the 
ship’s ambient air itself, dropping 
the pressure to, say, ten pounds 
to the square inch or even less. 

That might give them maneu- 
vering time in normal space — 
provided they were God-blessed 
enough to come out of one of the 
three remaining jumps within 
range of Earth, provided all the 
angels of heaven were helping 
them. 



Which, it was clear, he told 
himself, they weren’t. 

“Sir,” said Commander Bro- 
derick’s voice, “I think you can 
proceed now.” 

The Captain opened his eyes. 
“Thank you,” he said gravely 
and nodded to the Exec. It was a 
quick job by now. The kerosene 
lamps were already lit, the main 
electric circuits already cut; it 
was only a matter of double- 
checking and of getting the 
nucleophoretic generators up to 
speed. 

The Captain observed the rou- 
tine attentively. It did not matter 
that the fitness reports for which 
he was taking mental notes might 
never be written. It was a Cap- 
tain’s job to make his evalua- 
tions all the same. 

“Stand by to jump!” called the 
Exec, and the talker repeated it 
into the tubes. Down in the gen- 
erator room, the jumpmen lis- 
tened for the command, It came; 
they heaved on the enormous 
manual clutches. 

And Terra II slipped into 
Riemannian space once more. 

T HE stars whirled before the 
Captain’s eyes and became 
geometrical figures in prismatic 
colors. The slight, worn figure of 
the Library, the girl named Ek- 
lund, ballooned and wavered and 
seemed to float around the 
bridge. The Captain looked on 



THE MAPMAKERS

with composure; he was used to 
the illusions of hyperspace. Even 
— almost — he understood them. 
From the girl’s vast stored knowl- 
edge, he had learned of the con- 
nection between electric poten- 
tial and the three-dimensional 
matrix. 

Light and electrons: In hyper- 
space, they lied. 

Matter was still matter, he 
thought; the strange lights beyond 
the viewing pane were stars. And 
the subtler flow within his body 
was dependable enough, for he 
could hear as reliably as ever 
and if he touched something hot, 
the nerve ends would scream 
Burn! to his brain. But the mes- 
senger between the stars and the 
brain — the photons and electrons 
that conveyed the image — were 
aberrants; they followed curious 
Riemannian courses, and no 
brain bound by the strictures of 
three dimensions could sort them 
out. 

Just as now, thought the Cap- 
tain with detached amusement, 
I seem to be seeing old Groden 
here on the bridge. Ridiculous, 
but as plain as life. If I didn’t 
know he was asleep in the sick- 
bay, I’d swear it was he. 

“Captain! Captain!” Ensign 
Lorch’s voice penetrated over the 
metronome - cadenced commands 
of the Exec and the bustling 
noises of the bridge. 

The Captain stared wondering- 



ly at the phantasms of light. “En- 
sign Lorch?” he demanded. 
“But—” 

“Yes, sir! I’m really here and 
so is Groden.” Lorch’s voice went 
on as the Captain peered into the 
chaos of shifting images. Lorch 
himself wasn’t visible — unless 
that sea-green inverted monstro- 
sity with a head of fire was Lorch. 
But the voice was Lorch’s voice, 
and the figure of Groden, com- 
plete with the white wrappings 
over the eyes, was shadowy but 
real. And the voices were saying 
— astonishing things. 

“You mean,” said the Captain 
at last, “that Groden can pilot us 
home?” 

“That,” said Groden, in the 
first confident voice he had been 
able to use in days, “is just what 
he means.” 

V 

B LIND man’s buff. And what 
better player can there be 
than a blind man? 

Lieutenant Groden, eyeless and 
far-seeing, stood by the Exec’s 
left hand and clipped out courses 
and directions. The Exec mar- 
veled, and stared unbelievingly 
at the fantastic patterns outside 
the bridge, and followed orders. 

And presently Groden gave the 
order to stop all jets and drop 
back into normal space. In a 
moment, he was blind again — 



36

and the rest of the bridge com- 
plement found themselves star- 
ing at a reddish sun with a family 
of five planets, two of them 
Earthlike and green. 

“That’s not Sol!” barked the 
Captain. 

“No,” said Groden wearily, 
“but it’s a place to land and cool 
the ship and replenish our air. 
You ran us close to the danger 
line, Captain.” 

Terra II came whistling down 
onto a broad, sandy plain, and 
lay quiet, its jet tubes smoking, 
while the Planetology section put 
out its feelers and reported: 

“Temperature, pressure, at- 
mospheric analysis and radiation 
spectrum — all Earth normal. No 
poisons or biotic agents apparent 
on gross examination.” 

“There won’t be any on closer 
examination either,” said Groden. 
“This planet’s clean, Captain.” 
He stood hanging on to a stanch- 
ion, pressed down by the gravity 
of the world he had found for 
them. 

The Captain looked at him 
thoughtfully for a moment, but 
there were more important things 
to attend to. 

“Bleed in two pounds,” order- 
ed the Captain and the Duty Of- 
ficer saluted and issued orders 
into the speaking tube. 

They had run close to the dan- 
ger line, indeed; the ambient 
pressure inside Terra II’ s hull 



had been bled down to a scant 
ten pounds, in order to use as 
much cooling effect from releas- 
ing gas as possible. Whether it 
was clean or not, no man could 
step out onto the surface of the 
new planet until the pressures 
had been brought back to normal. 

They stood at the view panel 
looking out on the world. They 
were near its equator, but the 
temperature was cool by Earth 
standards. Before them was a 
broad, gentle sea; behind them, a 
rim of green-clad hills. 

The Captain made ready to 
send his first landing party onto 
a new and livable planet. 

* I ’'HE scouting parties were back 
and the Captain, for once, 
was smiling. “Wonderful!” he 
exulted. “A perfect planet for 
colonization — and we owe it all 
to you, Groden.” 

“That’s right,” said Groden. 
He was lying down on a ward- 
room bench — Broderick’s orders. 
Broderick had wanted to put him 
under sedation again, in fact, but 
that had brought Groden too 
close to mutiny. 

The Captain glanced at his 
Navigator. The swathed band- 
ages hid Groden’s expression, and 
after a moment the Captain de- 
cided to overlook the remark. 

He went on, “It’s a medal for 
you. You deserve it. Groden.” 
“He’ll need it, sir,” said Com- 



THE MAPMAKERS

mander Broderick. “There won’t 
be any new eyes for Lieutenant 
Groden.” He looked old and sick 
and defeated. “The optic nerves 
are too far gone. New eyes 
wouldn’t help now; there’s noth- 
ing that would help. He’ll never 
have eyes again.” 

“Sure,” said Groden casually. 
“I knew it before I brought you 
here, Captain.” 

The Captain frowned uncom- 
prehendingly, but Broderick 
caught the meaning in an instant. 
“You mean you could have 
brought us back to Earth?” he 
demanded. 

“In two jumps,” Groden told 
him easily. 

“Then why didn’t you?” snap- 
ped the Captain. “I have a re- 
sponsibility to my crew — I can’t 
let a man go blind because of 
phony heroics!” 

Groden swung him feet down, 
sat up. “Who’s a hero? I just 
didn’t want to trade what I have 
now for what I used to have, 
that’s all.” 

“Meaning what?” asked Bro- 
derick. 

“It’s more than seeing. Want 
to know how many Sol-type sys- 
tems there are within five thou- 
sand light-years of here? I can 
tell you. Want to know what the 
Universe looks like in hyper- 
space? I can tell you that, too, 
only I can’t describe it. It makes 
sense, Captain! The whole thing 



is as orderly and chartable as 
our own space. And I could see 
it, all of it. And you offer me 
eyes/” 

“But why don’t I see it, Gro- 
den?” the Captain puzzledly 
wanted to know. “Surely we’ve 
all closed our eyes for a moment 
in hyperspace — why didn’t we see 
it then?” 

“Sleep and death are alike, but 
they’re not the same. Neither is 
closing your eyes and being blind. 
I’m blind in normal space ; you’re 
blind in hyperspace — that isn’t 
much of an answer, but the 
medics will work it out.” 

The Surgeon looked piercingly 
at Groden’s bandaged face. 
“Then the odds are that any blind 
person can see in hyperspace?” 
“I think so,” Groden agreed. 
“In fact, I’m practically certain.” 
“Then,” said the Captain, “it’s 
our duty to return to Earth and 
let them know. They can equip 
each mapmaking ship with a blind 
person.” 

Groden gave his head a shake. 
“Plenty of time for that. Skip- 
per. We have a quadrant of 
hyperspace to chart. With me on 
hand to ‘see’ during the jumps, 
we’ll finish up fast. Then we can 
go back and tell them. But I 
think we should get on with the 
job we’ve been assigned.” 

“Right,” said the Captain after 
a pause. “We’ll bring the ship to 
stand-by for takeoff.”

f I iHE rockets thundered and 
Terra II split the atmosphere 
on its way to deeper space. 

As soon as they were clear, the 
ship readied for the jump and 
the Captain said, “Good luck, 
Groden. It’s all yours — give us 
our course.” 

Groden felt the quiver of the 
generators, far below, and at once 
the Universe lay spread before 
him. 

No more darkness, no blind 
fumblings. An end to basket- 
weaving and the dreary time- 
passing fingering of Braille for 
Earth’s incurable blind. They 



would be the eyes of the proud 
new hyperspace fleet that was yet 
to come! 

“It’s all yours, Groden,” the 
Captain repeated. 

Groden cleared his throat, is- 
sued his course vectors. 

Captain, you don’t know how 
right you are, he thought. Only 
it won’t be just mine — it’ll be the 
blind leading the sighted! 

Now there, he chuckled, was a 
switch. But he’d have to wait 
until he was back on Earth, 
among the blind, for it to be ap- 
preciated.

SPOKEN FOR 



He was lost — anyone could see 
that — but she had no idea how 
entirely lost he was nor why! 

By WILLIAM MORRISON 

Illustrated by EMSH 



H ALF of Jupiter’s great 
disk and most of the 
other moons were below 
the horizon when the man step- 
ped out of the plane and changed 
her life. As far as Carol Marsh 
was concerned, he was ordinary 
enough in appearance. And she 
wasn’t ordinarily attracted to or- 
dinary men. 

He was slightly over medium 
height, his features were not quite 
regular, and he had a deep tan 
over what had started out as a 
sunburn, so that she decided he 
had misjudged the strength of 
the sun on some planet with a 
thin atmosphere. 

She frowned as she watched 

40 



him look around. She was an- 
noyed by the fact that it took 
him almost a minute to get his 
bearings and realize that she was 
first, a human being and second, 
a girl well worth a man’s atten- 
tion. 

Even the troubled expression 
in his eyes was something she 
held against him. A man shouldn’t 
look troubled. A man should be 
confident, self-assured in a man- 
ner that also assured the girl he 
spoke to. She remembered that 
back on Earth John Burr had 
been completely self-assured. 

It was startling to realize that 
it was with this newcomer, whose 
appearance she had every reason 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to dislike, that she had fallen 
suddenly and completely in love, 
as suddenly and completely as if 
she had fallen off a cliff. 

“I’m looking for some people,” 
he said. “But I suppose — ” His 
very voice was ill at ease, and 
that was something else she 
should have held against him. 
And against herself. She had al- 
ways resented men whose voices 
betrayed their lack of confidence. 
“I suppose it’s no use,” he went 
on. “I’d recognize the house.” 

“Who are the people you’re 
looking for?” 

He took out a wallet, and from 
it drew a stereo picture. Two 
children, a boy and a girl, were 
standing with a smiling young 
woman in front of a sturdy, old- 
fashioned plastic house. Their 
clothes were out of fashion by a 
year or so, but that depended on 
where you were. Mars, for in- 
stance, was always three years 
behind Earth. Here on Gany- 
mede, on the other hand, you 
might even be ahead of Earth in 
some respects. 

A S CAROL’S eyes lifted to his, 
she saw him staring at the 
picture with such longing that 
she at once knew herself for a 
fool. They’re his wife and chil- 
dren, she thought. He’s trying io 
find them. And I had to fall in 
love with him at first sight. 



His eyes were on her now, and 
she said, “I’m sorry, I’ve never 
seen them.” 

“Have you lived around here 
long?” 

“Five years.” 

“Then this can’t be the place.” 
He stood there irresolutely and 
started to turn slowly away with- 
out even a word of thanks to her. 

“My father may have heard 
about them,” said Carol, know- 
ing herself for a fool again. 

Past experience, she told her- 
self ruefully, had taught her noth- 
ing. The thing to do was to let 
him go and forget him as quickly 
as possible, before she learned 
anything about him, before her 
feeling for him could become 
anything more than an irrational, 
momentary impulse. The strong- 
er the bonds of knowledge and 
interest between them, the more 
painful they would be to break. 
And the breaking was inevitable. 

The house where she and her 
father lived was a simple dome- 
shaped building, its walls and 
furniture both made of a silicon 
plastic whose raw materials had 
come from the ground on which 
it stood. There were rugs and 
draperies of a slightly different 
composition, woven on the all- 
purpose Household Helper that 
her father had bought before 
leaving Earth. They lived com- 
fortably enough, she thought, as 



SPOKEN FOR

she led the man in. 

But he hardly noticed the 
house or anything in it. When 
they reached the library and her 
father looked up from the book 
he was reading, only then did 
the man display interest. The 
book was a favorite of her fath- 
er’s and it made him unhappy to 
cut his reading short. 

Nevertheless, he turned off the 
projector, stood up, and said, 
“Yes, Carol?” 

“This man is looking for some 
— some friends of his, Dad. I 
thought you might be able to 
help him.” 

She held out the picture and, 
to her relief, her father stared at 
that instead of at her. Sometimes 
he was a little too shrewd; if she 
was making a fool of herself, 
there was no need for him to 
know it. He could be a sardonic 
man and he did not suffer fools 
gladly, even in his own family. 
He was of the opinion that she 
had used up her quota of foolish- 
ness with John Burr. 

He was shaking his head. 
“Sorry, I’ve never seen them. Are 
you sure they live around here?” 

“No,” said the man. “I’m not 
sure. I’m not sure of anything, 
except that they’re my wife and 
kids. And I’ve got to find them.” 

“Have you checked at the Dis- 
trict Office?” 

“I did that first. They couldn’t 



help me, but they said their rec- 
ords weren’t complete yet.” 
“They’re complete enough, I 
should think. Maybe they don’t 
list every prospector who wan- 
ders around without settling 
down, but they wouldn’t be likely 
to miss a woman and two chil- 
dren. I’m afraid that you’re 
wasting your time looking on 
Ganymede.” 

The man’s face clouded. “It 
isn’t a waste of my time,” he said. 
“I’ve got nothing else to do with 
it. And I have to find them. They 
need me.” 

"JV/TR. MARSH looked away 
from the man to his daugh- 
ter, and Carol was a little slow 
in avoiding his eyes. “I see,” he 
said, and she had an idea of 
what he meant by that. He saw 
too much. 

If he knew, there was nothing 
she could do about it. She said, 
“Perhaps Mr. — ” 

She paused, and the man said 
dully, “Callendar.” 

“Perhaps if Mr. Callendar 
would have dinner with us and 
tell us a little more, we’d be bet- 
ter able to help.” 

“Not a bad idea, Carol. We 
should know a little more.” 

Carol selected a dinner and 
pressed the button that would 
start its preparation. 

Her father said casually, “You 



SPOKEN FOR 



43 



are a stranger to Ganymede, 
aren’t you, Mr. Callendar?” 

“I’m not sure of that,” said the 
man. 

Her father’s eyebrows went up. 

Carol said, “But you do come 
from one of Jupiter’s moons?” 

“I can’t remember which one. 
There are a lot of things that my 
memory’s hazy about. I can’t 
even recall the name of the com- 
pany I worked for as an engi- 
neer.” 

“That may not be so strange. 
I find difficulty remembering the 
school where I taught on Earth. 
P.S. 654, wasn’t it, Dad?” 

“P.S. 634,” Mr. Marsh correct- 
ed briefly. 

“You see?” she said. “Do you 
remember your wife’s name? And 
the names of your children?” 

“I wouldn’t forget them,” he 
said. “My wife’s name was 
Mona.” He stared at the wall for 
a moment, his face without ex- 
pression. “I can still see the way 
she looked when I left to undergo 
treatment. Paul was — let’s see, 
he must be about nine, maybe 
ten, by this time. And Wilma 
must be six or seven. I remember 
how scared she was that time she 
found a harmless little phytopod. 
She thought it was going to bite 
her.” 

“Phytopod?” said Carol. “We 
don’t have them around here. 
What do they look like?” 



“They’re small and furry, and 
have two feet that look like roots. 
When they stand still you’re like- 
ly to mistake them for plants.” 

“You do recall some things,” 
said Carol. 

“The little things that don’t 
tell me where to look. I remem- 
ber the time we went on a picnic 
— I don’t recall how many moons 
there were in the sky — and the 
ground began to shake. It didn’t 
do any damage, but Wilma was 
terrified. Paul took it in his stride, 
though.” 

“There aren’t any earthquakes 
on Ganymede,” said her father. 
“If your memory of that incident 
is correct, you’re looking in the 
wrong place.” 

“I suppose so,” he said. “But 
what’s the right place?” 

“Perhaps if you thought of a 
few more incidents, we might fig- 
ure it out. It’s the little things 
you don’t forget that can be most 
helpful.” 

W HAT nonsense, thought 
Carol, although she kept the 
thought to herself. The little 
things can be most harmful. They 
keep the pain, and the memory 
of pain, alive and vivid. She re- 
membered little things about 
John all too well — the careless 
way he wore his clothes, and the 
way he combed his hair, the 
cigarettes he smoked, and the 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



foods he liked to eat. And the 
stupid way she had let herself 
fall in love with him. 

She hadn’t even had the excuse 
of its happening suddenly, as it 
had happened now. She had be- 
gun to love John as she had come 
to know him, disregarding all the 
evidence of his selfishness, of his 
genuine inability to care for any 
one else than John Burr. 

Unaware of what was going on 
in her mind, Callendar was say- 
ing, with somewhat more anima- 
tion than he had previously 
shown, “I think you’re right, Mr. 
Marsh. I’ve kept my troubles too 
much to myself. Maybe you can’t 
actually do anything for me, but 
it wouldn’t hurt me to talk. I 
should have done my talking long 
ago. When they found me.” 

“Where did they find you?” 
asked her father. “And what did 
you mean before, when you said 
you’re not sure of anything?” 

“They picked me up in a life- 
boat, drifting some place between 
Mars and Jupiter. The motor was 
off, but the power pile was work- 
ing, and the air-purifying equip- 
ment was on. I was apparently 
hibernating. I might have been 
that way for six months or a 
year.” 

“And you don’t remember — ■” 
said Carol. 

“There’s plenty I don’t remem- 
ber, but as I’ve said, my memory 



isn’t a complete blank. My wife 
and I and the kids had settled 
down in a new colony — exactly 
where it was is one of the things 
I forget. I believe now that it 
wasn’t Ganymede. Maybe it was 
some other moon of Jupiter’s. 

“Anyway, I seem to recall hav- 
ing some trouble with my health, 
and being taken onto an inter- 
planetary hospital ship for treat- 
ment — L-treatment, they called 
it. That’s where they put me to 
sleep. What happened after that, 
I can only guess. The ship must 
have been involved in some acci- 
dent. I must have been trans- 
ferred to the lifeboat.” 

“Alone?” asked Carol’s father. 
“No. There were two other pa- 
tients with me. They were found 
dead. I was the only one left 
alive. The bodies of the crew 
members who transferred us 
weren’t found at all. They might 
have gone back for more patients 
and then been unable to get away 
again.” 

“Who found your lifeboat?” 
“The crew of a freighter, who 
spotted it drifting across a space 
lane. They took me on board and 
revived me. But they were in a 
hurry and didn’t have much time 
to stay and investigate.” 

R. MARSH was thoughtful 
and silent. 

Carol asked, “Weren’t there 




SPOKEN FOR 



45 



any records in the lifeboat?” 
“Nobody thought of that, at 
least not in the beginning. At 
first, when I regained conscious- 
ness, my mind was almost a com- 
plete blank. Then I began to re- 
member things, but not enough. 
I couldn’t recall where the colony 
had been, and after I had recov- 
ered enough to be able to get 
around, I began looking for my 
wife and children. I haven’t come 
across a trace of them, although 
I’ve been on many worlds.” 

The food had long been ready 
and waiting. Until now, no one 
had thought of getting it. He 
stared as if through the wall and 
Carol, after she had set the dishes 
before him, had to remind him 
of their presence. When he did 
eat, it was automatically, with- 
out enjoyment. 

Afterward, her father surprised 
Carol by saying, “Why not stay 
with us overnight, Mr. Callendar? 
We have an extra room, and to- 
morrow I may be able to give 
you a little helpful information.” 
The man’s eyes came alive. 
“You’re serious? You think that 
from what I told you, you’ll be 
able to guess where I came 
from?” 

“I used the word ‘might.’ Don’t 
get your hopes up too much.” 

His face fell again. “Thanks 
for warning me,” he said in a flat 
tone. 



When, later on, he had gone to 
his room, Carol said, “Dad, do 
you really think you can help 
him?” 

“That depends on your idea of 
help. Why are you so interested 
in him? Perhaps you’re falling in 
love with him, Carol?” 

“I think so.” 

“Under the circumstances, 
that’s completely idiotic. Would 
there be any sense in asking why 
you fell in love with him?” 

“Well, he looked so lost! I 
guess it’s maternal — ” 

“As genuine a case of the grand 
passion as I’ve ever encountered,” 
he said drily. “Almost as genuine 
as your previous experience.” 
Carol flushed. “He isn’t like 
John.” 

UT^ORTUNATELY, you are 
right. Burr was essentially 
a selfish baby. I can’t imagine 
him spending his life looking for 
a wife and children he had lost. In 
future, Carol, if you must fall in 
love at all, do it suddenly. You 
choose much better that way.” 
“Yes, I know,” she said. “Ex- 
cept for the fact that the wife 
and children may interfere. But 
don’t worry, Dad. This time I’m 
not quitting my job and moving 
several million miles away to try 
to forget.” 

“There’ll be no need for that.” 
His face took on a troubled ex-

pression. “You’ll have to face 
your problem right here.” 

66V OU haven’t answered my 
question,” said Carol. “Do 
you really think you can help 
him?” 

“That isn’t an easy one to an- 
swer. We’ll have to prepare him 
for a shock, Carol. A first-class 
shock.- That’s why I wanted to be 
sure you were in love with him. 
It may make things easier for 
him to stand.” 

“What things?” 

Her father hesitated. “Have 
you ever heard of this L-treat- 
ment he mentioned?” 

She shook her head. 

“I thought not. Carol,” he said, 
and his voice was unexpectedly 
full of compassion, “you’re going 
to have a very sick man on your 
hands. It won’t be pleasant for 
either you or me, and it’s going 
to be horrible for him. But it 
must be gone through. He must 
be told.” 

“For heaven’s sake, what is it?” 

“The L in L-treatment,” he 
said slowly, “stands for longevity. 
That was what he was treated 
for. But you see now why it was 
found to be dangerous and dis- 
continued. The reason you never 
heard of it is that it was devel- 
oped and discarded two hundred 
years ago. Callendar wasn’t adrift 



in space for a year or two, as he 
thinks. He was adrift for two cen- 
turies.” 

“No! Oh, no!” 

“That’s why the clothes in 
those pictures seemed odd. 
They’ve been in style and out 
again half a dozen times, with 
slight changes each time. That is 
why, furthermore, he can’t find 
his wife and children on any of 
Jupiter’s moons. The moons were 
first colonized ninety years ago.” 
“But he says — ” 

“He’ll never see his wife and 
children again. They’ve lived 
their lives and died and been 
buried in the past. He should 
have died with them in his own 
time and not lived into ours.” 
“No,” said Carol, “or I’d never 
have known him.” 

She was white and trembling, 
and her father pulled her to him 
and let her head rest on his 
shoulder. 

Mr. Marsh said, “Perhaps 
you’re right. I don’t know. Any- 
way, he’ll have to be told. And 
for your sake, I’d better do the 
telling.” 

Carol was silent, and they both 
thought of the sleeping man who 
didn’t know that his old life had 
ended and that a new life was to 
begin so painfully in the morn- 
ing.

Property 




of Venus 



By L. SPRAGUE DE CAMP 

Naturally, botanical specimens from another 
planet couldn't possibly be like Earth's . 
but there should be a limit to differences! 



Illustrated by HUNTER 




T HE SOUND of three men 
in loud discussion of plant- 
ing-plans drew the man 
from Venus. This was at Mrs. 
Hort’s neighborhood party on a 
fine May weekend. The for- 
sythia’s golden rain had ended; 



the magnolias had littered the 
lawns with their petals; the 
azaleas blazed in orange and pur- 
ple and the dogwoods in pink 
and white. 

Carl Vanderhoff, on his second 
bottle of beer and fourth hot-dog 
sandwich, said: . I can’t bother 

much with annuals this year. I 
shall have to do some surgery 
on that cracked Japanese maple 
. .” He was medium-sized and a 
little gray, and taught French 
Lit at Penn. 

Sydney Devore, the oldest of 
the three, lit his pipe and said: 
“. I’ve got three new kinds of 
cactus, and as soon as I get them

unpotted. He led a retired life 
as a consulting engineer. 

Bill Converse, burly and ruddy, 
waved his fourth beer-bottle and 
said: “. if there’s any screwy 
plant in the world, trust Sydney 
to plant it . .” He was vice-presi- 
dent of the Keystone-Fidelity In- 
surance Company. 

Several of those at the party 
had objected to Devore’s uncon- 
ventional planting, such as his 
setting out assorted species of 
cactus. Vanderhoff had supposed 
that cactus would not thrive in 
the dank of a Philadelphian sub- 
urb, but these did as a result of 
Devore’s care in keeping weeds 
and grass away from them and 
potting them through the winter. 
As Vanderhoff’s own wife had 
said, Devore lived alone without 
a wife to keep him within the 
bounds of convention, but why 
couldn’t he plant decent iris, 
phlox and chrysanthemums like 
everybody else? 

The cactus made his lot stand 
out like a sore thumb. 

B EFORE Converse could say 
more about this eccentricity, 
Mrs. Hoyt’s brother, the space- 
man, sauntered over. His uniform, 
unless one looked closely, was 
like that of a chief petty officer 
of the United States Navy. Van- 
derhofT understood that Grant 
Oakley was in fact some sort of 
chief mechanic on the Goddard. 

50 



Carl Vanderhoff braced himself 
to look interested in Venerian 
matters, though the flight of the 
Goddard had been so overpubli- 
cized, and he had already seen, 
heard and read so much about it 
through the normal channels of 
information, that he was getting 
bored with it. 

“You fellas like to plant 
things?” said Grant Oakley with 
a noncommittal smile; a compact, 
competent-looking little man with 
bad teeth. 

“Wait till my roses come out,” 
boomed Converse. “I’ve got . 

“I’m trying out this new bug- 
killer, R-47,” said Vanderhoff. 
“It’s said to really lick the Jap- 
anese beetles . .” 

“Come over to my place after 
this breaks up,” said Devore, 
“and I’ll show you my South 
American . .” 

As they all spoke at once, Oak- 
ley stared with a vague smile un- 
til they ran down. Then he said: 
“How’d you like to plant some- 
thing from Venus?” 

“Oh, boy!” exclaimed Devore. 
“If I only could!” 

“Hm,” said Vanderhoff. “Per- 
haps.” 

“People would think I was 
nuts,” said Oakley. “I suppose a 
plant from Venus would come 
crawling into your house at night 
like some kind of octopus?” 

“No, nothing like that,” said 
Oakley. “The plants of Venus are 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



higher developed than ours, but 
they don’t run after you. What 
would it be worth to you to plant 
them?” 

Devore frowned. “You mean 
you have some?” 

Oakley smiled, dipped a hand 
into a coat pocket and brought 
it out. He opened it just enough 
to show a small fistful of seeds 
ranging in size from that of an 
apple seed to that of a lima bean. 

“Now,” he said, “supposing 
these were seeds from Venus — 
I’m not saying they are, under- 
stand — what would they be 
worth to you?” 

Vanderhoff said: “That would 
depend on what they grew up to.” 
Devore said: “I thought the 
Department of Agriculture had a 
regulation — ” 

“Who said anything about the 
Department of Agriculture?” 
asked Oakley. “I haven’t said 
these were from Venus. But sup- 
posing they were, what would 
you do about it?” 

Devore said: “Well, I suppose 
I ought — no, to hell with that. 
I want some. But I couldn’t pay 
you anything like the transporta- 
tion cost.” 

“The same for me,” said Van- 
derhoff. “How about you, Bill?” 
Converse rubbed his chin. 
‘We-ell — if you two take some, 
I guess I will, too. But none of us 
are rich, Mr. Oakley.” 

Oakley shrugged an eyebrow. 



“Neither am I. I brought these 
because I’ve got to have some 
quick money. How would ten 
bucks a seed strike you?” 

"T^EVORE whistled. “Suppose 
you tell us what they are 
first.” 

“You’ll read all about it when 
the Department of Agriculture 
gets out a bulletin. But these little 
black fellas are the singing shrub. 
The medium-sized — ” 

“What does the singing shrub 
do?” asked Vanderhoff. 

“It sings. The blue ones are 
the bulldog bush. You under- 
stand, these are just the names 
the fellas on the expedition called 
them. The scientists gave ’em 
Latin names, but you’ll have to 
read those in the Department of 
Agriculture Bulletin.” 

“How about the big red ones?” 
said Converse. 

“That’s the tree of Eden. It has 
the best-tasting fruit ever. Harm- 
less, too. We ate lots of it. It 
seemed to make everybody happy 
and grateful. Some called it the 
stein plant on account of it grows 
a thing shaped like a pitcher or 
more like an old German beer 
stein.” 

“What does the bulldog bush 
do?” said Devore. 

“It tries to bite, like one of 
those fly-catching plants on Earth, 
only bigger. I wouldn’t say to 
plant it if you’ve got small babies. 



PROPERTY OF VENUS 



51 



It may bite hard enough to hurt.” 
“How about growing up and 
biting our heads off?” Converse 
wanted to know. 

“It only grows so high, and the 
snappers about like so.” Oakley 
described with his hands a biting 
organ the size of a pair of human 
hands. “And it’s not that strong. 
Now how about it? Shall we have 
a little auction?” 

There ensued a long low argu- 
ment. More beer was drunk and 
hot-dogs eaten. The Sun went 
down; the neighborhood’s bat 
came out and flew in circles over 
Mrs. Hort’s party. At last the 



three householders each agreed 
to pay Grant Oakley fifty dollars, 
for which Converse should get 
the tree of Eden seeds, Vander- 
hoff all the bulldog bush seeds 
and Devore all the singing shrub 
seeds. 

They had disputed whether 
each of them should try to raise 
specimens of all three species, 
but concluded that a single extra- 
terrestrial species apiece would 
be enough to handle. VanderhofT 
would have preferred either the 
tree of Eden or the singing shrub, 
but his gardening friends put in 
their claims for these before he

saw her first and said: “Hello, 
gorgeous!” with the lupine ex- 
pression he assumed in address- 
ing his neighbors’ wives. 

Penny Vanderhoff simpered at 
him and said to her husband: 
“Carl, we really have to go. That 
sitter said she’d only stay till 
seven.” 

Vanderhoff slipped his seeds 
into his pocket and went along. 

“What were you talking with 
Mr. Oakley about?” said Penny 
Vanderhoff. “Venus?” 

“He was telling us about the 
plants there,” said Vanderhoff. 

He did not speak of his Vener- 



had a chance to and pressed them 
with such vigor that he gave 
way. 



66T1RING ’em in before frost,”

haven’t grown too big, that is. 
These came from the polar re- 
gions of Venus. Those are the 
only parts of the planet that 
aren’t so hot a man has to wear 
a protective suit. It’s about like 
the equator on Earth. So the 
plants won’t stand cold.” 

The seeds and money changed 
hands as Carl Vanderhoff’s wife 
Penelope came up. Bill Converse

ian seeds because this would have 
started an argument. Penny 
would have scolded him for be- 
ing eccentric, “just like that crazy 
Sydney Devore. I don’t know 
what you see in that man . .” 

In moments of fantasy, Carl 
Vanderhoff liked to imagine him- 
self an ancient patriarch, sitting 
in a tent with a towel over his 
head, combing his beard and 
ordering his wives, children and 
goats around. In practice, he 
never got anywhere near this en- 
vied state, as his wife and chil- 
dren could and often did outshout 
him in familial arguments. 

Although he was willing to co- 
erce his children by force, Penny 
always stood up for them, hav- 
ing been indoctrinated with the 
extreme educational progressiv- 
ism of the followers of Dewey 
and Watson. And in these days of 
easy divorce, there was no ques- 
tion of using force on one’s wife. 

Penny was not as gorgeous as 
Converse made her out with his 
leering compliments, being short 
and rather squarish of build, 
though still fairly pretty in a 
round-faced floral way. But that 
wasn’t the point. He longed to be 
the power in the household and 
he didn’t stand a chance. 

N EXT morning at breakfast, 
Vanderhoff put on his firmest 
face and said: “I shall plant some 
new things today. There will be 

54 



wire guards around them and 
anyone who steps on one gets the 
derri'ere beat off him. Je suis tout 
a fait serieux.” 

There was a condescending 
chorus of affirmative grunts and 
vocables filtered through corn 
flakes. 

“And, Dan,” continued Vander- 
hoff, “you left your baseball 
equipment all over the floor 
again. Either you clean it up or 
there’ll be no allowance.” 

After breakfast, Vanderhoff 
went out to plant his seeds. The 
neighborhood was waking into its 
usual Sunday-morning racket. 
The roar of power mowers was 
joined by the screech of the 
power saw in Mr. Hort’s base- 
ment and the chatter of Mr. Zan- 
ziger’s electric hedge trimmer. 
Mr. O’Ryan, hammering some- 
thing in his garage, furnished the 
percussion effect. 

Carl Vanderhoff walked about, 
wondering where to plant. If the 
bushes really bit, it would not do 
to plant them near the walks; 
they might grab guests or men 
delivering things. 

He had had a qualm about 
accepting the seeds for fear they 
would endanger his children. But 
since his youngest, Peter, was 
four and active, he thought he 
was not running much risk, espe- 
cially if he put up a guard heavy 
enough to keep plant and young- 
ster apart. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Besides, if Peter did get nip- 
ped, it would teach him to obey 
orders. 

Vanderhoff decided to plant 
the seeds outside his picture win- 
dow, in place of a mass of old 
jonquils that had practically 
ceased to flower and that he had 
been thinking of throwing away. 

He put on his rubbers, got out 
shovel and garden cart and went 
to work. When the jonquils were 
out of the way, he dug a hole for 
each of the six seeds, filled it with 
a mixture of mushroom soil and 
fertilizer, trod the earth hard, and 
finished off the surface with a 
slight bowl-shaped depression to 
catch the water. 

He watered the six places, 
stuck a flat stake beside each 
site with a notation, and put 
cylindrical wire guards over the 
spots. 

T HREE weeks after Vander- 
hoff had planted his seeds, 
five little yellow shoots appeared. 
Vanderhoff naturally did not 
know that the sixth had just 
germinated when a beetle grub, 
inching its sluggish way through 
the soft earth, had come upon it 
and devoured it. 

Vanderhoff diligently watered 
his plants. The clouds of Venus 
had turned out to be ordinary 
clouds of water droplets, not of 
formaldehyde as had been feared, 
and the surface of the planet was 



quite as rainy as fictional specu- 
lators had portrayed it. 

At the next session at Sydney 
Devore’s house, Vanderhoff asked 
Devore and Converse how their 
Venerian plants were coming 
along. Devore, who not only lived 
alone but further fractured con- 
vention by never speaking about 
his past or personal affairs, had 
a habit of throwing small penny- 
ante poker parties for the men of 
the neighborhood. Vanderhoff 
was the most regular guest. As a 
thinking man, he found Devore’s 
company congenial. Converse was 
the next most regular, not be- 
cause he was a thinking man, but 
to get away from his wife. Very 
little poker was played, for they 
found more pleasure in drinking 
and talking. 

Converse answered: “Only one 
of my three seeds sprouted, but 
the thing’s a foot high already. 
Take a look next time you go by 
my place, Professor.” Converse 
always called Vanderhoff “Pro- 
fessor” with a kind of annoying 
tolerance, as if being a professor 
were a disgrace or at least an 
embarrassing state to admit and 
he was big enough to disregard it. 

“How about yours, Syd?” asked 
Vanderhoff. 

“They all came up, but I can’t 
tell what they’ll look like. I plant- 
ed them down both sides of my 
front walk.” 

“You mean those little pink 



PROPERTY OF VENUS 



55 



things we passed on the way in?” 
“Yes. I moved the cactus to 
make room for them.” 

T HE azaleas went. The iris 
came and went. The peonies 
bloomed briefly and the tiger 
lilies for a longer time. Vander- 
hoffs bulldog bushes grew with 
extraterrestrial speed until, one 
Saturday, Penny said: “Carl, 

what on Earth are those things? 
They look like a Venus’ fly-trap, 
but they’re such a funny color 
and so big.” 

“Those are the plants I bought 
from Oakley.” 

“Who? Oh, you mean Mrs. 
Hort’s brother, who went to 
Venus. Are those Venus plants, 
then?” 

“That’s what he said. Tell the 
children not to poke their fingers 
at them or they’ll get bitten.” 
“Why, Carl, I won’t have such 
dangerous plants on the place!” 
“We’re going to have these. No- 
body’ll get hurt if he does as he’s 
told. I’m going to put heavier 
guards around the plants and if 
they get out of hand, I’ll cut 
them down.” 

“What’s that?” said Penny, 
turning her head. There was a 
sound like songbirds. “It’s funny, 
but it always sounds as if a lot of 
birds were singing at Devore’s 
place, even when you can’t see 
any.” 



“That must be his Venerian 
plants,” said Vanderhoff. 

“Well, I should think you could 
at least have taken the singing 
plants and given him the biting 
ones. It would have been more 
appropriate, if you must have 
these weird things. Why don’t you 
do like other people, instead of 
always trying to be smart and 
different?” 

“If you start that again, I’ll 
grow a beard and wear a beret. 
Then you’ll really have some- 
thing to complain of.” 

Penny went off in a huff, leav- 
ing Vanderhoff to work on his 
plants. He had long tried, with 
some success, to impress his fam- 
ily with the belief that, though a 
mild man in most respects, he 
was inflexible about his plants 
and terri le in his wrath if one 
was hurt. 

When he had finished garden- 
ing, Vanderhoff walked down the 
street to Devore’s house, from 
which the birdsongs issued. He 
found Devore squatting before 
one of the little pink bushes that 
had grown from his Venerian 
seeds. At the apex of each shrub 
grew a brown, convoluted struc- 
ture something like a flower; be- 
neath it, the stem swelled out in- 
to a bladderlike bag. 

As he looked more closely, 
Vanderhoff saw that these struc- 
tures were making the birdsongs. 



56 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The bladders swelled and shrank 
while the “flowers” on top quiv- 
ered and contracted. 

64%V7"HAT are you doing, Syd?” 
▼ V asked Vanderhoff. 
“Teaching these to say ‘good 
morning.’ ” 

“They can be taught?” 

“Within limits. They’re imita- 
tive, which is why they’ve been 
copying the local birds.” 

“How do you train them?” 
Devore held up a can of X- 
53-D, the latest super-fertilizer. 
“They love this and I give ’em 
a spoonful when they say some- 
thing right. An article in the Bo- 
tanical Gazette says they use 
these songs the way our flowers 
use color and perfumes, to attract 
Venerian flying things for pol- 
lenization.” Devore addressed the 
plant. “Good-morning, Mr. De- 
vore.” 

“G’morning, Mis’ Dwore.” 
“Good plant!” said Devore. He 
sprinkled a spoonful of X-53-D 
around the base of the bush and 
wetted it down with his watering 
can. “Reward of merit.” 

“I suppose you’d call that 
speaking with a Venerian accent,” 
said Vanderhoff. “I must make a 
phonetic transcription of it some 
time. How do they know you 
from anybody else?” 

Devore shrugged. “Sound or 
smell, I suppose. They don’t have 
any eyes, of course. Are your 



bushes doing any biting yet?” 
“They try to. Each pair of jaws 
has a sort of antenna sticking up 
above it, like a radar antenna. 
That seems to be how they sight 
on their prey.” 

“Can they draw blood?” 

“I don’t know. One got my 
finger the other day; quite a 
pinch, but it didn’t break the 
skin.” 

“What do you feed them?” 
asked Devore. 

“They seem to like tuna-fish 
best. Steak and ham they find 
indigestible.” 

“Hi, Professor!” came the loud 
voice of Bill Converse. “Hello, 
Syd. How’s your crab-grass this 
morning?” 

“It’s beginning to show up as 
usual,” said Devore. “How’s your 
bouncing betty?” For Converse, 
despite his noise about his expert 
gardening, had never eradicated 
all the soapwort or bouncing 
betty with which his flowerbeds 
had been overrun when he bought 
his house. 

“You needn’t kid me,” said 
Converse. “After all, bouncing 
betty does have a flower.” 

“Yeah,” said Devore. “That 
miserable weed. You’re just lazy.” 
He lowered his voice. “How’s the 
tree of Eden doing?” 

Converse rolled his eyes. “It’s 
as tall as I am. C’mon over and 
look at it.” 



PROPERTY OF VENUS 



57 



T HE tree of Eden, over six 
feet high, was a plant of curi- 
ous shape. A stubby trunk, about 
three feet tall and four or five 
inches thick, ended abruptly in 
an organ that hung down in front 
of the trunk and, spraying up and 
out behind it, a fan of slender 
stems of finger-thickness, each 
bearing a double row of small 
orange leaves. 

Vanderhoff had a fleeting im- 
pression of a sort of vegetable 
peacock with its tail spread. The 
organ in front had a pitcher- 
shape, rather like that of a ter- 
restrial pitcher-plant, only larger, 
complete with lid. This vessel 
was now as big as a bucket. The 
lid was grown fast to the top of 
the vessel so it could not be 
raised. 

“The funniest thing,” said Con- 
verse in the same low voice, “is 
not only how fast it grows, but 
that it has such hard wood. Norm- 
ally you expect anything that 
grows that fast to be soft and 
porous.” 

He bent down one of the stems 
for the others to feel. It did seem 
to be made of strong hard wood. 

Vanderhoff said: “Maybe these 
little berries are going to be that 
wonderful fruit Oakley told us 
about.” 

“Uh-huh,” said Converse. “At 
this rate, they ought to be ready 
to eat by September.” 

Devore said: “Let me suggest 



that you fence the tree off, or the 
kids will have eaten all the fruits 
before we old dodderers get a 
chance at them.” 

“Good idea, pal,” agreed Con- 
verse. “Tell you what — when 
they’re ripe, I’ll throw a neigh- 
borhood party and we’ll all eat 
them.” 

W ILLIAM Converse did fence 
off his tree, which continued 
to grow like Jack’s beanstalk. The 
neighborhood’s beds of phlox 
came out in crimson and white. 
Vanderhoff’s bulldog bushes grew 
larger and more voracious. Penny 
Vanderhoff got a gashed finger 
feeding one and had a row with 
her husband about getting rid of 
them. 

Curiously, neither the bulldog 
bushes nor the tree of Eden 
aroused comment. Vanderhoff’s 
picture window was at right 
angles to the street, and the 
bushes, planted beneath this win- 
dow, could not be seen from the 
street. Vanderhoff had threatened 
his children with dire penalties if 
they told outsiders about his mar- 
velous plants, and apparently 
they had obeyed him. 

The tree of Eden was in plain 
sight, but, while its strange shape 
caused many to ask Converse 
about it, they accepted his casual 
word that “Oh, that’s just a South 
African stein plant.” 

Sydney Devore’s, however, 



58 



6ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



could not be overlooked. First his 
singing shrubs twittered in imita- 
tion of the birds they heard. One, 
in fact, took to hooting like a 
screech owl, except that the plant 
hooted all day instead of at night 
like a well-regulated owl. 

Then Devore taught them to 
greet him with “Good morning, 
Mr. Devore” as he came down 
his walk. When his neighbors 
asked him what was happening, 
he made jocular or enigmatic re- 
marks, such as asserting that he 
had wired the plants for sound. 
But the plants’ behavior was so 
egregious that the explanations 
were not believed. As the plants 
grew, their tonal range and in- 
telligibility increased. 

Devore taught them a more 
elaborate repertory. He hopped 
up the morning greeting from a 
mere “Good morning, Mr. De- 
vore!” to such phrases as “All 
hail, Your Imperial Highness!” 

W HEN their greetings were as 
magniloquent as the most 
egotistical paranoid could desire, 
Devore started teaching the bush- 
es to sing Clementine. He had 
trouble getting them to sing in 
unison, but he persevered. Eve- 
ning after evening, the neighbor- 
hood gathered to see Devore 
striding up and down his walk, 
tapping a little Indian drum and 
exhorting his plants. 

“Just wait,” said Penny Van- 



derhoff to her husband. “Any day 
now, a swarm of F.B.I. men and 
newspaper reporters will come 
down on us. They’ll take you 
three to jail and the reporters 
will write stories that’ll cost you 
your job.” 

But that was thfe summer so 
much happened — the near-war 
between India and China over 
Nepal, the death of President 
Tringstad in an airplane crash, 
and the return of the Bergerac 
from Mars — that the newspapers 
had their attention elsewhere. 

At any rate, the mums and 
gladioli were out and nothing had 
yet befallen when Bill Converse, 
after tasting a fruit of his tree of 
Eden, pronounced it ripe and in- 
vited the neighborhood to a Sat- 
urday evening party to eat the 
whole crop. 

This was the weekend after 
Labor Day. On this weekend, the 
International Council of Lan- 
guage Teachers’ Associations met 
in New York City. Carl Vander- 
hoff went to New York as a dele- 
gate, intending to return Sunday 
evening. 

It also happened that Bill Con- 
verse read in Popular Gardening 
an article about Venerian plants 
in general and the tree of Eden 
in particular. Enough of these 
plants had now been grown by 
the Northern Regional Research 
Laboratory of the Department of

allow some conclusions about 
them. But Converse, who glanced 
more and more through his own 
windows toward the Vanderhoffs’ 
house, said nothing about this 
even to his gardening friends, 
Devore and Vanderhoff. 

T HE day of the Converse party, 
Penelope Vanderhoff tele- 
phoned Mrs. Converse. “Mary? 
I’m so sorry, but I can’t come to 
your party this afternoon.” 

“Oh,” said Mary Converse, 
“isn’t that too bad?” 

“My sitter has stood me up and 
Carl’s away, so I have to stay 
home,” Penny explained. 

“Aren’t they old enough to be 
left?” 

“Well, Dan is eight and Elea- 
nor six, but if you leave them 
alone they fight, scream, chase 
each other, break windows, upset 
furniture and make a shambles 
of the place. I can’t imagine why 
— I’ve always let them do as 
they pleased, like it says in the 
book — but that’s how it is. So 
I’ll have to pass it up.” 

When Mary Converse told her 
husband, he said: “Oh. Too bad. 
I’ll take her some of the fruit.” 
“It’ll be all right if that’s all 
you do over there,” said Mary 
Converse. 

“Damn it!” shouted Converse. 
“I don’t see why I put up with 
your groundless suspicions!” 

The refreshments at the Con- 



verse party consisted of martinis 
and tree of Eden fruits. The 
guests picked the fruits directly 
from the tree, from which Con- 
verse had removed the fence. The 
fruits looked like plums, but 
proved to be without pits. They 
gave out a delicious, enticing 
smell that had the guests drooling 
by the time they received their 
portions. The taste caused gasps, 
cries, closed eyes. 

The tree now towered twelve 
feet tall, while the pitcherlike 
organ in front was as large as a 
laundry hamper. The lid of the 
organ had come loose from the 
rest, except for a hingelike con- 
nection in the back. The edges 
of the lid curled up a little, so 
one could look down into the 
empty body of the pitcher. 

The spray of slender stems 
bore hundreds of fruits. Any less- 
er number would have been 
quickly consumed. The guests 
hardly bothered with their cock- 
tails in their rush to gorge them- 
selves on Venerian fruits. When 
the lower branches of the fan 
had been stripped, Bill Converse, 
his face red from martinis, lugged 
a stepladder from his garage and 
climbed it to hand down more 
fruit. 

Converse did not eat any him- 
self. When a lull in the demand 
allowed him, he took a small 
paper bag from his pocket, un- 
folded it and dropped a dozen of 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the fruits into it. Then he quietly 
came down from the ladder and 
walked away from the party to- 
ward the Vanderhoff house. 

There he rang the doorbell. 
Penelope came. Converse said: 
“Here’s some fruit, Penny.” 

“Oh, thank you,” she said. 
“Won’t you come in?” 

“Sure. Maybe you’d like to put 
those on a plate and eat ’em 
now.” 

Penelope got out a plate, 
dumped the fruits out on it and 
ate one. “My, these are delicious. 
I’ve never tasted anything like 
them. Won’t you have one?” 
“Thanks,” said Converse, “but 
I’ve had all I can hold.” 

B ACK at the Converse party, 
guests, stuffed with fruit, were 
sitting and standing about lethar- 
gically, wiping the juice of the 
fruits off their hands and sipping 
martinis. The only fruit yet un- 
eaten were a few on the highest 
parts of the tree, which could not 
be reached by the stepladder. 

Two men walked slowly up the 
walk, peering about. One was 
lean and hatchet-faced; the other 
short and stout with thick-lensed 
glasses. While all the male guests 
were in sport-shirts, the newcom- 
ers wore coats. 

The shorter one said: “There’s 
the house and that’s one of the 
plants.” 

The two drifted quietly up to 



the crowd around the tree of 
Eden and the taller asked Mr. 
Zanziger: “Excuse me, but which 
is Mr. Converse?” 

Zanziger answered: “Bill isn’t 
here just now. He went over to 
the Vanderhoff house.” 

“Are Mr. Vanderhoff or Mr. 
Devore here?” 

“Mr. Vanderhoff isn’t, but I 
think Mr. Devore — yeah, that’s 
him.” Zanziger pointed to the 
square-jawed, gray-haired figure 
with the pipe. 

Mary Converse said: “I’m Mrs. 
Converse. What can I do for 
you?” 

The hatchet-faced man said: 
“I have here a warrant for your 
husband’s arrest. Also for Mr. 
Vanderhoff and Mr. Devore. Here 
are my credentials.” The man 
produced the badge of a United 
States deputy marshal, and add- 
ed: “My name is Jacobson, and 
this is H. Breckenridge Bing of 
the Department of Agriculture. 
Where — ” 

Devore stepped up. “Did some- 
body say I was wanted?” 

“I’m sorry to say you are,” 
said Jacobson, producing more 
papers from his inside coat pock- 
et “Here’s the warrant for your 
arrest on the charge of buying 
articles whose importation is for- 
bidden by the Plant Import Con- 
trol Act of 1963, as amended 
1989. Now if — ” 

“Why, I don’t know what 



PROPERTY OF VENUS 



61 



you’re talking about,” said De- 
vore with an exaggerated expres- 
sion of innocent astonishment. 

“Ahem,” said the short stout 
man. “He means that Amphorius 
tentatius — ” Bing indicated the 
tree of Eden — “as well as sev- 
eral specimens of Faucifrons 
mordax and Cantodumus mimi- 
c us. Our investigations show — ” 
Devore broke in. “Are you the 
H. Breckenridge Bing who wrote 
in the Botanical Gazette on the 
reclassification of the Pterido- 
phyta in the light of recent paleo- 
botanical evidence?” 

“Why — uh — yes.” 

Devore shook the man’s hand. 
“That was a swell piece, but I 
never thought I’d be arrested by 
the author.” 

“Well — er — I assure you I 
would have preferred not to be a 
party to your arrest, but they 
sent me along to identify the 
contraband plants.” 

J ACOBSON said: “If you’ll 

show me where Mr. Converse 
and Mr. Vanderhoff are. I’ll run 
you down to the Federal Build- 
ing in my car and you’ll be out 
on bail in a few minutes.” 

“What will they do to Mr. Con- 
verse and the others?” asked 
Mary Converse. 

“Probably just a fine,” said 
Jacobson. 

“Oh,” said Mary Converse in 
a disappointed tone. 

62 



The deputy marshal continued: 
“It depends partly on whether 
they’re cooperative witnesses in 
the prosecution of Grant Oakley, 
who sold them the seeds. He’s 
the one who we’ll really throw 
the book at. He’s under arrest 
now.” 

“My brother in jail!” cried 
Mrs. Hort, but nobody heeded 
her. 

Devore asked: “I suppose the 
Department of Agriculture will 
send a truck around to gather up 
our Venerian plants?” 

Bing’s eyes blinked behind 
their spectacles. “That’s right. It’s 
bad enough to bring in an exotic 
plant from some place on Earth 
when its properties aren’t fully 
known, and a hundred times more 
risky to bring in one from an- 
other planet. You never know 
what might happen. It — uh — 
might spread all over, like the 
prickly-pear cactus in Australia. 
Or it might have a disease that 
would get loose and wipe out the 
wheat crop.” 

“Um,” said Devore. “I hadn’t 
thought of that.” 

“Come on, Breck,” said Jacob- 
son. “Show me the Vanderhoff 
house.” 

A guest named Dietz, who had 
had several martinis too many, 
muttered: “Don’t worry, you 

beautiful plant, we won’t let these 
guys take you away from us.” 

H. Breckenridge Bing con- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tinued: “Now this Amphorius, for 
instance, has a strange property. 
I suppose you know that the bio- 
chemistry of the higher Venerian 
organisms turned out to be al- 
most the same as that of terres- 
trial vertebrates?” 

Devore nodded vigorously; the 
other hearers in more tentative 
fashion. 

“Well, you remember that in 
the 1970s, Petchnikov isolated 
gratisone, the gratitude hormone, 
which is secreted by the pineal 
gland. It occurs in such minute 
amounts that it had been over- 
looked, but it controls animal be- 
havior somewhat as prolactin 
stimulates mother-love. It’s one 
of the things that makes com- 
munity and family life possible. 
Now the fruit of Amphorius con- 
tains significant amounts of grati- 
sone, or a substance almost iden- 
tical with it. The result is that 
anybody who eats an Amphorius 
fruit is soon seized by an irre- 
sistible desire to please the thing 
or person from whom the fruit 
was received. If you eat it off the 
tree, you want to please the tree.” 

4WTTEY, Breck!” said Jacobson, 

A 1 tugging at Bing’s sleeve. 
H. Breckenridge Bing was no 
man to relinquish an audience 
for anything less than a convul- 
sion of nature. He continued: 
“Now Amphorius is a carnivorous 
plant, like Faucitrons, but instead 



of snatching its prey, it persuades 
the prey to feed itself to the 
plant. Small vertebrates who eat 
the fruit climb into the amphora 
— ” Bing indicated the steinlike 
structure — “and are digested. 
The highest form of Venerian 
life, the yellow gibbon-like Sauro- 
pithecus xanthoderma, is too in- 
telligent to thrust itself into the 
amphora. Instead, the tribe seizes 
the weakest member as a sacrifice 
to the plant and thrusts him into 
the vessel. 

“If, on the other hand, you 
receive the fruit from another 
person, you — ” 

“My gosh!” cried Mary Con- 
verse. “That no-good husband of 
mine took a bag of the things 
over to Penny Vanderhoff! Three 
guesses what he’s up to!” 

Dietz, the drunken guest, said: 
“And that’s what we ought to do 
to Mr. Bing and Mr. Jacobson 
here. Nothing’s too good for our 
tree, not even a Federal dick.” 
Bing gave a forced smile. “I 
don’t think human beings would 
go to the extremes of the Ven- 
erian lizard-monkey — ” 

“Oh, wouldn’t we?” said an- 
other guest. “Tear up our plant 
and take it away, will you?” 

“Now look here — ” said Jacob- 
son. 

“Into the jug with them!” 
yelled a guest, and the cry was 
taken up. The circle began to 
close in on the Federal men, who 



PROPERTY OF VENUS 



63 



backed hastily toward the street. 

Deputy Marshal Jacobson 
drew a pistol from under his arm- 
pit, saying: “You’re all under 

ar — ” 

Standing on his right was 
young John S.- Mosely, expected 
to be Penn’s star halfback during 
the coming football season. Mose- 
ley let fly a kick that sent the 
pistol thirty feet into the air, to 
fall among Converse’s pachy- 
sandra. 

The guests closed in, clutching. 

There was a crash of glass from 
the Vanderhoff house, but nobody 
heard it. 

/"’ARL Vanderhoff returned 
^ home Saturday evening in- 
stead of Sunday as he had 
planned. He delivered his paper 
Saturday morning; he saw every- 
body he really wanted to see by 
the end of Saturday’s lunch; he 
discovered that the meetings and 
papers scheduled for Sunday 
were of little interest; finally, 
Professor Junius White of the 
University of Virginia offered 
him a lift home if he would leave 
Saturday afternoon. 

The thought of saving both 
train fare and a night’s hotel bill, 
and of getting home in time for 
the tail-end of the Converse 
party, decided Vanderhoff to 
leave early. 

He walked the half-block from 
where he was dropped by White, 

64 



who had declined an invitation to 
stop in. He marched up to his 
front door, entered and dropped 
the briefcase containing his notes, 
pajamas and other equipment for 
the Conference. He almost 
tripped over young Daniel’s light- 
weight baseball bat, clucked with 
annoyance, leaned the bat against 
the corner, and made a mental 
note to fine Daniel. 

Then he filled his lungs to 
shout: “Hello, family!” but closed 
his mouth and let his breath out 
as muffled sounds of human 
activity came from the living 
room. 

Frowning, Vanderhoff took 
three steps to the threshold. On 
the sofa, his wife sat in hot, amor- 
ous embrace with his neighbor 
Converse. 

Converse looked up at the 
slight sound of Vanderhoff’s en- 
trance. Vanderhoff stared blank- 
ly. Then the habits of a lifetime 
started to curl his lips into a 
cordial smile of greeting, while 
at the same time a rising fury 
distorted this automatic smile in- 
to something else — an expres- 
sion at which Converse looked 
with visible horror. 

Vanderhoff took a step for- 
ward. Converse, though he out- 
weighed the professor of French 
Literature by twenty pounds, tore 
himself loose from Penelope, 
looked furtively around, and 
crashed through the window. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



There was a scrambling in the 
shrubbery outside. At the same 
instant, from the other direction 
came the cries and footfalls of a 
crowd pursuing something along 
the street, but Vanderhoff’s atten- 
tion was drawn by a loud cry 
from beyond the window, fol- 
lowed by the yell: “Ow! Help! 
It’s got me!” 

Vanderhoff hurried to the win- 
dow. 

Converse had fallen among the 
bulldog bushes, which had in- 
stantly seized him. Two of the 
jaws had grips on each of his 
legs, or at least on the trousers 
that clothed them, while a fifth 
held a fold of his sport-shirt. 

Converse, on hands and knees, 
had crawled as far out of the 
clump as he could and was trying 
to get farther, while the other 
jaws of the bushes lunged and 
snapped at him like the heads of 
snakes. 

He had knocked over a couple 
of the wire guards that Vander- 
hoff had set up in front of the 
bushes. His right hand had blood 
on it, apparently from a cut sus- 
tained when he broke the window. 
Fragments of glass, reflecting 
the golden sunset, gleamed on 
the frantically trampled ground 
among the bushes. 

T/ r ANDERHOFF stood with 
* pursed lips, contemplating 
various kinds of assault. If he 



merely used his fists, Converse 
would grab him and probably 
give him a worse beating than 
he inflicted. Then he remembered 
Dan’s bat. He strode into the hall, 
picked up the bat, went out the 
back door, and came around to 
where Converse sprawled in the 
grip of the bushes. 

“Hey!” cried Converse. “Don’t 
do that, Carl! Let’s be civilized 
about this! I didn’t mean any 
harm! I was just — ” 

The sound of a blunt instru- 
ment on a human skull ended his 
explanation. Converse yelped and 
moaned, but could not crawl back 
among the bushes lest worse be- 
fall him. 

As Vanderhoff stepped back, 
sounds from the street attracted 
his attention. He hurried around 
the corner of his house and saw 
a strange procession winding to- 
ward the Converse home. 

First came Sydney Devore, 
beating his Indian drum. Then 
came four neighbors, each hold- 
ing one limb of a short, fat man 
who struggled. Then came the 
other neighbors, male and female, 
moving in a fashion that re- 
sembled one of the more athletic 
Latin-American dances. 

As the line passed Devore’s 
place, his singing shrubs burst 
into Clementine. 

Vanderhoff found these sights 
and sounds so strange that, fore- 
going further revenge for the mo- 



PROPERTY OF VENUS 



65 




ment, he followed the procession 
with the bat on his shoulder. 

The marchers danced up to 
the Converse house. One guest 
raised the lid of the pitcher of the 
tree of Eden, while the four who 
held the little man prepared to 
thrust him in. 

VanderhofT caught up with the 
head of the procession and asked 
Devore: “Hey, Sydney, what’s 
going on? Are you all crazy?” 

“No-o, we’re just going to re- 
ward the tree for its lovely fruit.” 

“You mean they’re going to 
sacrifice this man? Who is he, 
anyway?” 

Devore explained about H. 
Breckenridge Bing. “The other 
one got away. He could run 
faster.” 

“But what’ll happen to this 
one?” 

Devore shrugged. “He’ll be di- 
gested, I suppose. Serves him 
right. It should stimulate the tree 
no end.” 

“You’re insane,” said Vander 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



\ 




hoff, and pushed his way through 
the crowd to the tree. 

The four stalwarts had finally 
inserted Bing into the amphora, 
despite his struggles and the 
tightness of the fit. Muffled cries 
came from inside. Bing’s fingers 
could be seen curled over the 
edge of the pitcher as he tried to 
force his way out, but the plant 
now held down the lid by its own 
mechanisms. The amphora re- 
mained closed, though it bulged 
this way and that as Bing kicked 
and butted. 

ET away!” said Vanderhoff, 
shoving the Converses’ 
guests aside and grasping the 
edge of the lid. 

“Wait, you can’t do that!” Dietz 
cried, seizing Vanderhoff’s arm. 
“Leave our plant alone or we’ll 
feed you to it, too!” 

Vanderhoff resignedly hit Dietz 
over the head with his bat. As 
Dietz staggered back, holding his 
head, several other guests rushed 
at Vanderhoff. He waded in with 
the bat, cracking arms, heads, and 
knuckles with such verve that the 
attackers fell back, leaving the 
football-playing Moseley uncon- 
scious on the lawn. 

Vanderhoff then returned to 
the tree of Eden, keeping an eye 
cocked for another rush. When 
heaving on the lid had no effect, 
he struck the amphora with his 
bat. This induced a yell of an- 



PROPERTY OF VENUS 



67 



guish from inside, but did not 
loosen the plant’s hold. 

Then Vanderhoff got out his 
pocket-knife and attacked the 
hinge of the stein-lid. He drew it 
across the grain again and again. 
After he had sawed half an inch 
into the structure, he found he 
had weakened the hinge enough 
so that he could raise the lid. 

Bing climbed out. His glasses 
were gone and his scanty hair 
was awry. His skin was covered 
with red spots and his clothes 
were stained by the tree’s diges- 
tive juices. 

He peered nearsightedly at 
Vanderhoff. “Did you get me out? 
Thanks. As for the rest of you — ” 

Mary Converse shook her head 
and said: “I don’t know what 
could have got into us, Mr. Bing. 
I’d never do such a dreadful 
thing.” 

“Gratisone got into you, that’s 
what,” said Bing. “Now you see 
why we can’t let just anybody 
plant extraterrestrial plants.” 

The others, too, seemed to be 



coming out of their madness. Mr. 
Hort said: “You must let us pay 
to have your suit cleaned.” 

Dietz said: “We’d better buy 
him a new suit. The plant’s diges- 
tive juices will eat that one full 
of holes.” 

It was finally agreed that Mr. 
O’Ryan should act as banker for 
the neighborhood and assess them 
whatever was needed to repay 
the damages sustained by Bing. 
Just as this agreement was 
reached, one of the township’s 
patrol cars drew up. Out got 
Deputy Marshal Jacobson and 
the two local policemen. 

Jacobson growled: “You’re all 
under arrest for forcibly intimi- 
dating a United States officer!” 

“They couldn’t help it, Jake,” 
said Bing. “It was the fruit. I’m 
not going to press any com- 
plaints.” 

“Why not?” demanded Jacob- 
son. 

“Well, Mr. Devore said he 
liked my article. I didn’t know 
anybody had even read it.”

/^ARL Vanderhoff returned 
home late that evening, after 
he and Devore had departed in 
Jacobson’s official car and Con- 
verse, released from the bulldog 
bush, in an ambulance. 

He told his wife: “They let me 
sign my own bond. It seems I’m 
something of a hero for rescuing 
that little botanist, so I shall be 
let off easily. And Bill never said 
a word about me; he just let 
them think it was the bushes that 
beat him into a pulp. He’d better! 
And now what have you to say?” 
“I — I don’t know how to ex- 
plain — I must have gone out of 
my head — I never loved any- 
body but you — ” 

“That’s all right,” said Vander- 



hoff, and told her about gratisone. 
“Now that that’s over, send those 
kids in here. Dan is going to be 
penalized for leaving his bat on 
the floor, and the whole outfit 
will be run on orderly lines from 
now on. No backtalk, either.” 

“Yes, dear,” said Penelope. 

“And if I feel like growing a 
beard tomorrow, I’ll grow one.” 
VanderhofFs picture of himself as 
an ancient patriarch, sitting in his 
tent and ordering his wives, chil- 
dren and goats around, might not 
last. The family would probably 
wear him back down to his nor- 
mal mild self.

THE ORBITAL (Unmanned) 
SATELLITE VEHICLE 

T HE TIME has come when 
humanity is capable of 
throwing its first artificial 
satellite into the sky, and our 
cpver shows Mel Hunter’s idea 
of how it might be done. It is a 
rather startling idea, combining 
some elements one would not 
normally combine that way. But 
there is at least one good reason 
for this combination, though it 
may not be a decisive reason. 
However, before I go into this 
with some more detail, the prob- 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




lem itself needs some explaining 
and clarifying. 

As I told some time ago in an- 
other column in Galaxy, the 
idea of the artificial satellite grew 
slowly, even though its total age 
is not much over a generation. 

When Prof. Hermann Oberth 
first published his rocket theory 
in 1923 and 1925, he mentioned 
that it might be worthwhile to 
put a manned rocketship in an 
orbit around Earth in order to 
pursue a few interesting research 
projects. He went on to say that 
a very large rocketship might be 
left in such an orbit while the 
pilot returned to the ground by 
means of a smaller landing rock- 
et* It was on the basis of this 
suggestion that the concept of the 
manned space station was devel- 
oped through the years, culminat- 
ing in Wernher von Braun’s space 
station project, which was pub- 
lished for the first time several 
years ago. 

I NTERESTINGLY enough, no- 
body, for a long time, thought 
of an unmanned satellite. Other- 
wise the rocket pioneers had 
rather definite ideas on how “the 
art” would progress. It would be- 
gin with small liquid fuel rockets 
of which nothing was expected 
except that they functioned at all. 

Once one had functioning 
liquid fuel rockets, one could 
study them for improvements and 



one would, in time, arrive at the 
first useful item: the instrument- 
carrying high-altitude research 
rocket. The high-altitude rocket, 
in turn, would be the foundation 
for the long-range rocket (either 
as a military weapon or a mail 
carrier or both) and then, when 
the long-range rocket had grown 
big enough, it would turn into a 
piloted rocketship which could 
rise beyond the atmosphere and, 
if desired, take up an orbit around 
Earth. 

These phophecies of thirty 
years ago have not only largely 
come true — they even came 
true in just about the manner 
and the order foreseen. The item 
missing in the early forecasts was, 
as has been mentioned, the un- 
manned satellite. I can, in retro- 
spect, think of a few reasons why 
nobody thought of it. 

At the time when Oberth and 
others talked about high-altitude 
research rockets, the idea was 
still that the rocket and its in- 
struments would return to the 
ground by means of a parachute, 
or by separate parachutes if this 
should turn out to be more prac- 
ticable. Then the instruments 
would be picked up and their 
records examined. In reality — 
even though some of the smaller 
types of liquid fuel rockets have 
been recovered by parachute in 
the meantime — this is not the 
method generally followed. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



71 



During the time needed by the 
liquid fuel rockets to grow to the 
necessary size to become high- 
altitude research rockets, another 
technique grew up, too, the one 
now called “telemetering.” In 
principle, it consists of hooking 
up the instruments with an auto- 
matic radio transmitter so that 
the instrument readings are 
broadcast and received and re- 
corded on the ground while the 
rocket is still climbing. 

Without such telemetering, an 
unmanned artificial satellite 
would have seemed useless. What 
would have been the use of 
throwing a package of instru- 
ments into an orbit around Earth 
if the only way of recovery 
would have been by manned 
rocketship? If you had to build 
a manned rocketship for this pur- 
pose, it was far more logical to 
expect the manned ship to take 
the readings in the first place. 

B UT now we do have tele- 
metering and that changes 
the whole picture. A package of 
instruments circling Earth could 
report to what extent it was 
warmed by the Sun and how 
much (and how fast) it would 
cool off when in the shadow of 
Earth. Such a package could 
count the number of cosmic rays 
encountered and report it to the 
ground station. It could count, 
and report, the number of impacts 

72 



of cosmic dust particles and one 
could even go so far as to divide 
the outer skin into a number of 
“reporting areas” so that one 
could get a good idea of the dis- 
tribution of cosmic dust impacts. 

It has also been suggested to 
make a small pressurized cabin 
with an experimental animal in 
it a part of the instrument pack- 
age, for the behavior and reac- 
tions of the animal over a period 
of several days of apparent 
weightlessness would be very 
worth while knowing. (At the 
end of the observation period, 
the animal could be killed in- 
stantly and painlessly by having 
a timing device release hydro- 
cyanic acid into the compart- 
ment.) 

In addition to these general 
problems, an artificial satellite 
could be used with probable suc- 
cess to attack a few special prob- 
lems. If the artificial satellite did 
not circle Earth over its equator, 
but had been placed into an orbit 
cutting across at a slant, its whole 
orbit would slowly be turned 
around. This is technically known 
as the progression of the nodes 
and the rate of this progression 
would furnish us with rather pre- 
cise information about the volume 
of Earth’s equatorial bulge. 

An artificial satellite placed in- 
to an orbit which leads over both 
magnetic poles could be specially 
equipped to tell us more about 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Earth’s magnetic field. Inciden- 
tally, it would also provide a 
great deal of useful knowledge 
about the cosmic rays and their 
distribution in Earth’s magnetic 
field. 

If we had one artificial satellite 
moving at a certain height over 
the equator and equipped to re- 
port cosmic dust particle impact, 
and another artificial satellite, 
equipped in the same way but 
moving in an orbit which passes 
over both geographical poles, we 
would quickly find out whether 
there is a higher accumulation 
of cosmic dust over the equator 
(or in the plane of the ecliptic), 
which is a theoretical possibility. 

Another and rather obvious 
job for an artificial satellite 
would be to demonstrate how 
much drag is caused at a given 
height by the ait molecules — 
one can’t very well call it atmos- 
phere — still present. Right now, 
you won’t find anybody who’ll be 
willing to give definite figures for 
residual drag at, say, 180 miles. 
But you’ll find a large number of 
people who would part with a 
month’s pay, if necessary, to find 
out. 

The method of finding out 
would be simplicity itself — put 
an artificial satellite into an orbit 
180 miles above the ground and 
watch it carefully. Residual drag 
will make its orbit shrink — and 
cause it to burn up in the atmos- 



phere like a meteorite in the 
end — and the rate of shrinkage 
will provide the figure for the 
drag. Of course, once this has 
been solved for the 180 miles 
mentioned, the experiment might 
be repeated for 250 or 300 miles. 
The goal is still the manned space 
station and engineers want to be 
very sure that there is no obser- 
vable residual drag at the height 
where that is going to be built. 

TF YOU have followed carefully, 
you’ll have noticed that quite 
a number of the problems to be 
solved do not require reporting 
instruments. In various cases, the 
answer can be found by observa- 
tion of the orbit assumed by the 
satellite; the instrumentation 
would report on something else. 
This means that the first artificial 
satellite — or possibly the first 
two or three — do not need to 
be instrumented. Their very exist- 
ence would do the job. 

Hence the fairly recent con- 
cept of the un-instrumented arti- 
ficial satellite. We would learn 
something (something, I wish to 
stress, that cannot be learned any 
other way) if we merely threw 
a bale of cotton into an orbit 
around Earth. Obviously such a 
“bale of cotton” would be cheaper 
by far than a complicated instru- 
ment package and in all proba- 
bility it will cost less fuel to 
throw it into an orbit.

All that is really required of 
the first one is that it can be 
observed from the ground visu- 
ally and photographically and 
that it will give a radar echo. 

How large would it have to be 
for this purpose? 

I know from lecture experience 
that the size thought to be neces- 
sary for observation is always 
wildly overestimated. Recently a 
reader sent me a newspaper clip- 
ping about an amateur astrono- 
mer who said that he believed 
that he had discovered a second 
moon of Earth. The clipping went 
on to tell that the distance esti- 
mated was 400 miles above the 
ground and that the amateur 
astronomer stated that it was 
quite small, “possibly less than a 
hundred feet in diameter.” I have 
put this sentence in quotation 
marks because it is not clear 
from the article whether this was 
a verbatim quote or a remark by 
the newspaper reporter himself. 

The answer to the whole story 
is that a second moon of Earth, 
moving at a distance of 400 miles 
and about 100 feet in diameter, 
would have been discovered a 
long time ago because under 
favorable conditions, at dawn and 
at dusk, it would be a naked-eye 
object which might be faint but 
would be conspicuous because of 
its visible movement. 

What is really possible with 
modern instrumentation (and 

74 



you don’t have to think of the 
200-inch reflector or the 48-inch 
Schmidt camera) has recently 
been told by Clyde Tombaugh, 
who is hunting for moonlets of 
Earth. He could detect a V-2 
rocket at the distance of the 
Moon (240,000 miles) or a tennis 
ball at a distance of 1000 miles, 
provided only that both were 
painted white. This refers to 
photographic rather than visual 
detection, but it shows what can 
be done. It also shows that the 
un-instrumented artificial satellite 
would not have to be very large. 

O NE suggestion made is to use 
an inelastic plastic balloon, 
white in color and radar-reflec- 
tive and pack it into the nose of 
a rocket. The nose compartment 
would be in sections, held to- 
gether by explosive bolts so that 
it can be made to fall part either 
by means of a timing device or 
by radio command from the 
ground. 

The same timing device would 
open the valve of a tiny pressure 
cartridge inflating the balloon. 
Since the outside pressure is zero, 
the pressure required for inflating 
the balloon is very small; an 
ounce per square inch would be 
fully sufficient. Because of the 
lack of pressure from the outside, 
this balloon would keep its shape 
even if punctured by a meteorite, 
which is why I stated that it 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



should be an inelastic balloon 
that is not stretched during infla- 
tion but is inflated merely to 
establish its shape. 

Another suggestion for a very 
simple un-instrumented artificial 
satellite is to carry a pressure 
cartridge containing a plastic 
foam, similar to the aerosol shav- 
ing cream bombs. Here nothing 
is needed but a timing device 
operating the valve at the right 
time, after the rocket has settled 
in the orbit. The total weight of 
such an un-instrumented satellite 
would be ridiculously small, six 
or eight pounds, but the bubble 
would be large enough for easy 
observation with small instru- 
ments, for radar echoes and even 
for naked-eye visibility at dawn 
or dusk, when the observer is 
still (or already) in the shadow 
of Earth but the artificial satellite 
is still in sunlight. 

Now let us see how difficult it 
would be to get it into space. The 
so-called circular velocity for 
Earth, the velocity with which a 
body must move to stay always 
at the same distance from the 
ground, is given by the square 
root of g(r -)- h) where g means 
gravity, as usual, r means the 
radius of Earth and h refers to 
the distance above the ground. If 
h is zero, the value for the circu- 
lar velocity is 4.943 miles per 
second. That is the speed a satel- 
lite would have if it were racing 



around Earth at ten feet above 
sea level. 

Obviously this cannot be done 
because of air resistance. At a 
distance of 1000 miles, the neces- 
sary speed is 4.4 miles per second; 
a quarter of a million miles away, 
it is only 0.64 miles per second. 

But these figures are deceptive 
in a certain way. True, the farther 
the satellite is from Earth, the 
smaller its orbital velocity, but 
that does not mean that it would 
be easier to establish a satellite 
at 10,000 miles than at 500 miles. 
It needs extra fuel to lift it to 
that distance, so the cheapest 
satellite, in terms of fuel expendi- 
ture, is the one closest to Earth 
that the presence of the atmos- 
phere will permit. 

T ET us say, for the sake of 
round figures, that the artifi- 
cial satellite will require an or- 
bital velocity of 4.5 miles per 
second. The rocket must be capa- 
ble of attaining this velocity, 
parallel to the ground. And in 
the process of attaining this velo- 
city, it must climb out of the 
atmosphere against Earth’s gravi- 
ty and against atmospheric drag 
for part of the way. 

If the rocket climbed on a near- 
vertical path all the way, it would, 
of course, traverse the atmos- 
phere along the shortest route, 
but its “heading” would be wrong. 
The solution is the one which has 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



75 



been in use for a long time for 
long-range rockets: vertical take- 
off and a vertical, or very nearly 
so, path for the first eight or ten 
miles. Then a gradual tilt in the 
proper direction, assuming shal- 
lower and shallower angles to the 
horizontal. For long-range rock- 
ets, the tilt is usually stopped 
when the angle is near 45°, since 
this results in the longest range 
for a given velocity. For estab- 
lishing an artificial satellite, the 
angle would be still shallower. 

Of course it cannot be a single 
rocket. If we wanted a single 
rocket to go into such an orbit, 
it would need so much fuel that 
it would have to have a mass- 
ratio of about 40:1, which means 
that its takeoff weight should be 
40 times as high as the weight of 
what finally gets into space. Such 
a rocket obviously cannot be 
built. The answer is the step prin- 
ciple, a rocket carrying another 
rocket as its payload, and the 
payload of the second rocket be- 
ing a third rocket. That way, you 
get rid of unnecessary dead 
weight just about as soon as it 
can be done. 

Now the general rule for the 
velocity a rocket will attain is 
that the velocity of the rocket 
becomes equal to the exhaust 
velocity if the mass-ratio is equal 
to 2.72. This, however, does not 
include the fuel that is expended 
in fighting gravity and that re- 

76 



quired to overcome air resistance. 
An extra allowance has to be 
made for that. 

If we assume that our fuel will 
produce an exhaust velocity of 
1.5 miles per second — a little 
high for present-day fuels, but I 
am not advocating a special de- 
sign, only to demonstrate the 
principle — such a mass-ratio of 
2.72 : 1 would produce a rocket 
velocity of 1.5 miles per second. 
If we take the mass-ratio a bit 
higher, namely 3.5:1, the rocket 
velocity would be 5/4 of the ex- 
haust velocity or 1.87 miles per 
second. Since the establishment 
of the artificial satellite needs 4.5 
miles per second plus allowance 
for the climb and some air resist- 
ance, and since 3 times 1.87 is 
5.61, the rocket needed for the 
job would be a three-stage rocket. 

W E’LL run quickly through a 
rough weight calculation for 
the whole. If the payload weighs 
8 pounds and the empty rocket 
of Stage III weighs 60 pounds, 
the third stage would need 170 
pounds of fuel, so that its total 
weight would be 238 pounds. This 
is the “payload” for the second 
stage, which we’ll assume to 
weigh 812 pounds empty. It 
would need 2625 pounds of fuel, 
so that the “payload” for the first 
stage would work out to 3675 
pounds. If the empty rocket of 
the first stage weighs 6125 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



pounds, the fuel for the first stage 
would be 24,500 pounds, so that 
the total takeoff weight for the 
whole three-stage job would be 
34,300 pounds or about 15 V 2 
tons. That wouldn’t be much big- 
ger than the 12-ton V-2. 

But a rocket engineer entrust- 
ed with the job of designing a 
three-stage rocket for an unin- 
strumented artificial satellite 
would not start from scratch in 
this manner. He would look 
around for existing rockets which 
could be fitted into a three-stage 
assembly with only minor modi- 
fications. 

When the two-stage rockets of 
Project Bumper were designed, 
two existing and then available 
types were used: V-2s for the 
first stages and WAC Corporals 
for the second stages (even 
though everybody, including the 
designer, of course, knew that a 
specially developed second stage 
would produce much better re- 
sults). For the satellite-carrying 
three-stager, the engineer might 
hope for three different available 
rockets which, in combination, 
would produce the required ulti- 
mate velocity. Naturally, it may 
happen that he has to settle for 
two and design a stage between 
them to do the job. 

An interesting example of such 
thinking, with an additional idea 
thrown in, was a paper read at 
the Ninth Annual Meeting of the 



American Rocket Society in De- 
cember, 1954. During the past 
few years, Dr. Van Allen had 
obtained very satisfactory results 
by launching the solid-fuel “Dea- 
con” rockets from high-flying 
plastic balloons. Because the bal- 
loon carried the rocket to regions 
where air resistance has become 
almost negligible, the rockets 
operated under near-ideal condi- 
tions : they could move under 
high accelerations. 

The two authors of the paper 
(K. Stehling of Bell Aircraft Co. 
and R. M. Missert of the Univer- 
sity of Iowa) advocated the 
launching of the artificial satel- 
lite by means of a balloon-borne 
rocket. Their first stage was to 
consist of four solid-fuel booster 
units with a total weight of 12,000 
pounds. The second stage was to 
be a 1300 pound liquid fuel 
rocket and the third stage a 200 
pound liquid fuel rocket with a 
thrust of 2000 pounds and a pay- 
load (satellite) of 30 pounds. 

All these figures sound “reason- 
able” in the sense that rockets of 
about these specifications are 
likely to exist. The solid-fuel 
boosters resemble a British type 
which has been discussed in avia- 
tion magazines, the second stage 
corresponds approximately to the 
Aerobee rocket and the third 
stage might be built around a 
liquid fuel booster.

T O SUBSTITUTE a fast jet 
plane for the balloon would 
have a number of advantages. 
The jet plane probably could not 
carry the rocket to quite the 
height reached by a plastic bal- 
loon, but it could go high enough 
so that more than half of the 
total mass of the atmosphere 
would be below the rocket. 

To make up for the compara- 
tive lack of height, the jet plane 
would provide an initial velocity 
of V 4 mile per second. If it flew 
in an easterly direction near the 
equator, Earth’s rotation would 
have added another Vi mile per 
second before the plane even took 
off. This would leave slightly 
more than 4 miles per second to 
be added by the rocket assembly, 
which might be done even by a 
two-stage rocket, especially since 
the plane would provide direction 
and elevation (by pulling out of 
* a shallow dive) so that the guid- 
ance equipment of the rocket 
could be kept to a minimum. All 
it would have to do is to go where 
aimed. 

Again, somebody toying with 
this possibility would have to look 
around for two suitable rockets 
plus a suitable jet plane. But 
whether air-launched or ground- 
launched, the combination of 
rockets required to throw a small 
uninstrumented satellite into an 
orbit should be achievable in the 
near future.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Just what is the internal con- 
stitution of Jupiter? In the book 
“Earth, Moon and Planets” by 
Fred L. Whipple, Jupiter is shown 
as consisting of a metallic core 
overlaid by a thick shell of ice 
and a deep hydrogen atmosphere. 
The diameter of the metallic core 
is shown to be about half the 
total diameter. In a more recent 
book by George Gamow, the 
same scheme is followed, but the 
metallic core is at best 10 per 
cent of the total diameter. Which 
one is right? 

Charles B. Hoffmeister 
Montclair, New Jersey 

To answer the last sentence 
first: I don’t know which is 
right and if anybody else does, 
he has kept quiet so far. Natur- 
ally we don’t know the internal 
constitution of Jupiter; these 
are various “educated guesses” 
to make the mass come out 
right for the observed dimen- 
sions and to account, simultane- 
ously, for the measured tem- 
peratures. 

In a still more recent book, 
Robert S. Richardson’s Explor- 
ing Mars, you can find a cross 
section of Jupiter according to 
the ideas of W . H. Ramsay of 
Manchester University, Eng- 
land. Professor Ramsay’s fun- 
damental proposition is that 
Jupiter consists mostly of hy- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



clrogen, all oilier elements be- 
ing present in such small 
amounts (comparatively speak- 
ing) that they can he regarded 
as mere impurities of the hy- 
drogen. In this concept, the 
surface of the planet consists 
of colil gases in violent motion, 
which is what we see in the 
telescope. 

The pressure below this sur- 
face builds up rapidly and at 
a depth of, say, 500 miles, the 
planet’s crust would consist 
mostly of solid hydrogen. At a 
depth of 2000 miles, the solid 
hydrogen is calculated to be 
under a pressure of 200,000 
atmospheres. At a depth of 
5000 miles, the pressure would 
approach 800,000 atmospheres. 

The solid hydrogen would 
have a density of 0.3 of that of 
w T ater at 2000 miles and of 0.4 
at 5000 miles. At a pressure of 
800,000 atmospheres, solid hy- 
drogen changes to metallic hy- 
drogen, which is far more com- 
pressible than solid hydrogen. 

Ramsay’s picture of Jupiter 
then consists of a solid hydro- 
gen shell 5500 miles thick cov- 
ering a sphere of metallic 
hydrogen 75,800 miles in di- 
ameter. Tin- density of the solid 
hydrogen is supposed to lie 
between 0.3 and 0.4; the den- 
sity of the metallic hydrogen is 
calculated as being 0.9 near the 
surface of the metallic hydro- 



gen sphere and 3.7 at its center. 

This, too, makes the overall 
density come out correctly, but 
whether this picture corre- 
sponds to reality is something 
that oidy future research can 
tell. 

What is the escape velocity 
for each planet of the Solar Sys- 
tem and how is it found? 

Earl Dawney 
Route No. 2 
Gadsden, Alabama 

The escape velocities of the 
various planets, expressed in 
miles per second and rounded 
off to the nearest l/10th of a 
mile, are as follows: 



Mercury 


2.2 


Venus 


6.3 


Earth 


7.0 


Mars 


3.1 


Jupiter 


37.0 


Saturn 


22.0 


Uranus 


13.0 


Neptune 


14.0 


Pluto 


6.0 


Moon 


1.5 



In order to find the escape 
velocity for any planet, it is 
necessary to know its surface 
gravity. The escape velocity 
corresponds to the impact velo- 
city of a body which fell to the 
planet from infinity; this hap- 
pens to be equal to a fall 
through a field of constant sur-

face gravity for the distance of 
one planet radius. The formula 
is the square root of 2 g multi- 
plied by the planet radius; the 
“g” refers to the surface gravity 
of the planet.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



DEADHEAD 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

All deadheads naturally came 
to Mars without tickets — but 
this one was just the ticket! 



1 DROVE down to Marsport 
a few hours after the Earth 
ship landed. There were dia- 
mond-tip drills on board, which 
I had had on requisition for over 
a year. I wanted to claim them 
before someone took them. That’s 
not to imply that anyone would 
steal anything; we’re all gentle- 
men and scientists here on Mars. 
But things are hard to get, and 
theft-by-priority is the way a gen- 
tleman-scientist steals what he 
needs. 

I loaded my drills into the jeep 
just as Carson from Mining drove 
up waving a Most Urgent Top 
Crash Priority. Luckily, I had 



had the good sense to secure a 
topmost priority from Director 
Burke. Carson was so pleasant 
about it that I gave him three 
drills. 

He chugged away on his scoot- 
er, over the red sands of Mars 
that look so good in color photog- 
raphy, but gum up engines so 
completely. 

I walked over to the Earth 
ship, not because I give a damn 
about spaceships, but just to look 
at something different. 

Then I saw the deadhead. 

He was standing near the 
spaceship, his eyes as big as 
saucers, looking at the red sand,

DEADHEAD

the scorched landing pits, the 
five buildings of Marsport. The 
expression on his face said, 
“Mars! Gee!” 

I groaned inwardly. I had more 
work that day than I could ac- 
complish in a month. But the 
deadhead was my problem. Di- 
rector Burke, in a moment of un- 
usual whimsy, had said to me, 
“Tully, you have a way with 
people. You understand them. 
They like you. Therefore I am 
appointing you Mars Security 
Chief.” 

Which meant I was in charge 
of deadheads. 

T HIS particular one was about 
twenty years old. He was 
over six feet tall, with perhaps a 
hundred some very odd pounds 
of ill-nourished meat on his bones. 
His nose was turning a bright 
red in our healthy Martian cli- 
mate. He had big, clumsy-look- 
ing hands, big feet, and he was 
gasping like a fish out of water 
in our healthy Martian atmos- 
phere. Naturally, he didn’t have 
a respirator. Deadheads never do. 

I walked up to him and said, 
“Well, how do you like it here?” 
“Gol-/ee!” he said. 

“Quite a feeling, isn’t it?” I 
asked him. “Actually standing on 
a real honest-to-John alien plan- 
et.” 

“I’ll say it is!” the deadhead 



gasped. He was turning a faint 
blue from oxygen starvation, all 
except the tip of his nose. I de- 
cided to let him suffer a little 
longer. 

“So you stowed away on that 
freighter,” I said. “You rode dead- 
head to wonderful, enchanting, 
exotic Mars.” 

“Well, I don’t think you could 
call me a stowaway,” he said, 
fighting for breath. “I sorta — 
sorta — ” 

“Sorta bribed the captain,” I 
finished for him. By this time, he 
was weaving unsteadily on his 
long, skinny legs. I pulled out my 
spare respirator and clapped it 
over his nose. 

“Come on, deadhead,” I said. 
“I’ll get you something to eat. 
Then you and I are going to have 
a serious talk.” 

I held his arm on the way to 
the mess hall, because he was 
goggling so hard he would have 
fallen over something and broken 
it. Inside, I boosted the atmos- 
phere and warmed some pork 
and beans for him. 

He wolfed them down, leaned 
back in the chair and grinned 
ear from ear. “My name’s Johnny 
Franklin,” he said. “Mars! I can’t 
believe I’m really here.” 

That’s what all the deadheads 
say, those who survive the trip. 
There are about ten attempts a 
year, but only one or two make 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



it alive. They’re such idiots, most 
of them. A deadhead manages to 
sneak on board a freighter, in 
spite of all the security checks. 

The ship takes off at about 
twenty Gs and, without special 
protection, the deadhead is 
crushed flat. If he survives that, 
radiation gets him. Or he’s as- 
phyxiated in the airless hold, be- 
fore ha can reach the pilot’s com- 
partment. 

We’ve got a special graveyard 
here, just for deadheads. 

But a few of them pull through, 
and they walk onto Mars with 
big hopes and stars in their eyes. 

I’m the guy who has to disillu- 
sion them. 

it TUST what did you come to 

J Mars for?” I asked. 

“I’ll tell you,” Franklin said. 
“On Earth you gotta do just like 
everybody else does. You gotta 
think like everybody else and act 
like everybody else or they lock 
you up.” 

I nodded. Earth was stable 
now, for the first time in the his- 
tory of mankind. World peace, 
world government, world pros- 
perity. The authorities wanted to 
keep it that way. I think they go 
too far in the suppression of even 
harmless individualism, but who 
am I to say? Things will prob- 
ably relax in a hundred years or 
so, but that’s not good enough 



for a deadhead living now. 

“So you felt the need of new 
horizons,” I said. 

“Yes, sir,” Franklin said. “I 
hope this doesn’t sound too corny 
to you, sir, but I want to be a 
pioneer. I don’t care how hard it 
is. I’ll work! You’ll see, just let 
me stay, please, sir! I’ll work so 
hard — ” 

“Doing what?” I asked. 

“Huh?” He looked startled for 
a moment. Then he said, “I’ll do 
anything.” 

“But what can you do? We 
could use a good inorganic chem- 
ist, of course. Do your skills hap- 
pen to run along that line?” 

“No, sir,” the deadhead said. 

I didn’t enjoy doing this, but 
it was important to impress the 
grim and unpalatable truth upon 
deadheads. “So your field isn’t 
chemistry,” I mused. “Might have 
a spot for a top-notch geologist. 
Or possibly a statistician.” 

“I’m afraid — ” 

“Tell me, Franklin, have you 
got your Ph.d.?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Doctorate? Masters? Have 
you even got a B.S.?” 

“No, sir,” Franklin said miser- 
ably. “I never even finished high 
school.” 

“Then just what do you think 
you can do here?” I asked. 

“Well, sir,” Franklin said. “I 
read where the Project is scat-

tered all over Mars. I thought I 
could be maybe a messenger, 
sorta. And I can also do carpen- 
try, and some plumbing and — 
there must be something I can 
do here.” 

I poured Franklin another cup 
of coffee and he looked at me, 
his big eyes pleading. The dead- 
heads always look like that when 
we reach this point. They think 
that Mars is like Alaska in the 
’70s, or Antartica in 2000; a fron- 
tier for brave, determined men. 
But Mars isn’t a frontier. It’s a 
dead end. 

“Franklin,” I said, “did you 
know that Mars Project is not 
self-supporting, and may never 
be? Did you know that it costs 
the project about fifty thousand 
dollars a year to maintain a man 
here? Do you figure you’re worth 
a salary of fifty thousand a year?” 
“I won’t eat much,” Franklin 
said. “And once I get the hang 
of things I’ll — ” 

“And," I broke ii\, “were you 
also aware that there isn’t a man 
on Mars who doesn’t hold at 
least the title of Doctor?” 

“I didn’t know that,” Franklin 
whispered. 

D eadheads never do. i 

have to tell them. So I told 
Franklin that scientists do the 
plumbing, carpentry, messenger 
work, the cooking, cleaning and 

84 



repairing, all in their spare time. 
Not well, perhaps, but it gets 
done. 

The fact is: There is no un- 
skilled labor on Mars. We just 
can’t afford it. 

I thought he’d burst into tears, 
but he managed to control him- 
self. 

He stared wistfully around 
the room, looking at everything 
in our crummy little mess hall. 
You see, it was all Martian. 

“Come on,” I said, standing up. 
“I’ll find a bed for you. Tomor- 
row we’ll arrange your passage 
back to Earth. Don’t feel so bad. 
At least you’ve seen Mars.” 

“Yes, sir.” The deadhead stood 
up wearily. “But, sir, I am not 
going back to Earth.” 

I didn’t argue with him. A lot 
of deadheads talk big. How was 
I to know what this one had in 
his mind? 

After settling Franklin, I re- 
turned to my lab and did a few 
hours work that absolutely had 
to be done. Then I fell into bed 
exhausted. 

The next morning, I went to 
wake Franklin. He wasn’t in his 
bed. Immediately I thought of 
the possibility of sabotage. Who 
knows what a thwarted pioneer 
will do? Pull some rods out of 
the pile, perhaps, or set off the 
fuel dump. I scurried around the 
camp looking frantically, and fin-

ally found him at the half-built 
spec lab. 

The spec lab was necessarily a 
spare-time project with us. When- 
ever anyone had an extra half 
hour, he mortared a few bricks, 
sawed out a table-top, or screwed 
hinges on a door. No one could 
be spared from his work long 
enough to really put the thing 
together. 

Franklin had accomplished 
more in a few hours than most 
of us had in a few months. He 
was a good carpenter, all right, 
and he worked as though all the 
furies' of hell were pursuing him. 

“Franklin!” I shouted. 

“Yes, sir.” He hurried over to 
me. “Just wanted to do some- 
thing for my keep, Mr. Tully. 
Give me a few more hours and 
I’ll have a roof on her. And if no 
one’s using those pipe lengths 
over there, I could maybe finish 
the plumbing by tomorrow.” 

Franklin was a good man, all 
right. He was just the sort Mars 
needed. By all the rules of human 
decency and justice I should have 
patted him on the shoulder and 
said, “Boy, book-learning isn’t 
everything. You can stay. We 
need you.” 

1 REALLY wanted to say just 
that. But I couldn’t. There are 
no success stories on Mars. No 
deadhead makes good. We scien- 

86 



tists can manage the carpentry 
and plumbing, poor though the 
results may be. And we just can’t 
afford duplication of skills. 

“Will you please stop making 
this hard for me, Franklin? I’m a 
soft-hearted slob. You’ve con- 
vinced me. But all I can do is 
enforce the rules. You must go 
back.” 

“I can’t go back.” Franklin 
said very softly. 

“Huh?” 

“They’ll lock me up if I go 
back,” Franklin said. 

“All right, tell me about it,” I 
groaned. “But please make it 
quick.” 

“Yes, sir. Like I told you,” 
Franklin said. “On Earth, you 
gotta do like everybody else, and 
think like everybody else. Well, 
that was fine for a while. But 
then I discovered The Truth.” 

“You what?” 

“I discovered The Truth,” 
Franklin said proudly. “I found 
it by accident, but it was really 
very simple. It was so simple, I 
taught it to my sister, and if she 
could learn it, anyone could. 
Then I tried to teach it to every- 
body.” 

“Go on,” I said. 

“Well, everybody got very an- 
gry. They told me I was crazy, 
I should shut up. But I couldn’t 
shut up, Mr. Tully, because it 
was The Truth. So when they 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



went to lock me up, I came to 
Mars.” 

Oh, great, I thought. Franklin 
was just what we needed on 
Mars. A good, old-fashioned re- 
ligious fanatic to preach to us 
hardened scientists. And he was 
just what the doctor ordered for 
me. Now, after sending him back 
to Earth — to prison — I could 
suffer guilt feelings the rest of my 
life. 

“And that isn’t all,” Franklin 
said. 

“You mean there’s more to this 
pathetic tale?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Go on,” I said with a sigh. 

“They’re after my sister, too,” 
Franklin said. “You see, after she 
saw The Truth, she was as eager 
to teach it as me. It’s The Truth, 
you know. So now she has to hide, 
until — until — ” He wiped his 
nose and gulped miserably. “I 
thought I could show you how 
good I’d be or Mars, and then 
my sister could join me and — ” 

“Stop!” I said. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“I don’t want to hear any 
more,” I told him. “I’ve already 
listened to you too much.” 

“Would you like me to tell you 
The Truth?” Franklin asked 
eagerly. “I could explain — ” 

“Not another word.” I barked. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Franklin, there is nothing, ab- 



solutely nothing I can do for you. 
You haven’t got the qualifica- 
tions. I haven’t the authority to 
allow you to stay. But I will do 
the only thing I can do. I’ll speak 
to the Director about you.” 

“Gee! Thanks a lot, Mr. Tully. 
Would you explain to him that I 
haven’t really recovered from 
that trip yet? Once I get my 
strength back, I’ll show you — ” 
“Sure, sure,” I said, and hur- 
ried off. 

T HE Director stared at me as 
though I had slipped my 
regulator. “But Tully,” he said, 
“you know the rules.” 

“Sure,” I said. “But he really 
would be useful. And I hate to 
ship him back to the police.” 

“It costs fifty thousand dollars 
a year to maintain a man on 
Mars,” the Director said. “Do you 
think he’s worth a salary of — ” 
“I know, I know,” I said. “But 
he’s such a pathetic case, and he’s 
so eager, and we could use — ” 
“All deadheads are pathetic,” 
the Director said. 

“Yeah. After all, they’re in- 
ferior human beings, not like us 
scientists. So back he goes.” 
“Ed,” the Director spoke quiet- 
ly. “I can see resentment build- 
ing between us over this. There- 
fore I’m going to leave it up to 
you. You know that there are 
close to ten thousand applications

a year for a berth in Mars Pro- 
ject. We turn back better men 
than ourselves. Kids in the uni- 
versities study for years to fill a 
specific place here, and then find 
the position already taken. Con- 
sidering all that, do you honestly 
feel that Franklin should stay?” 

“I — I — oh, damnit, no, if 
you put it that way.” I was still 
angry. 

“Is there any other way to put 
it?” the Director asked. 

“Of course not.” 

“It’s a sad situation when many 
are called but few are chosen,” 
the Director mused. “There’s a 
need for a new frontier. I’d like 
to open Mars wide open for col- 
onization. And someday we will. 
But not until we’re self-support- 
ing.” 

“Right,” I said. “I’ll arrange for 
the deadhead’s return.” 

F RANKLIN was working on 
the roof of the spec lab when 
I returned, and he had only to 
look at my face to know what the 
answer was. 

I climbed in my jeep and drove 
to Marsport. I had quite a few 
harsh words to say to the captain 
of the space freighter who had 
allowed Franklin on board. Too 
much of that stuff goes on. This 
joker was going to carry Frank- 
lin back to Earth. 

The freighter was in the blast 



pit, its nose pointing skyward. 
Clarkson, our atomics man, was 
readying it for takeoff. 

“Where’s the captain of this 
heap?” I asked. 

“No captain,” Clarkson said. 
“This is a drone model. Radio- 
controlled.” 

My stomach started to do slow 
flip-flops. “No captain?” 

“Nope.” 

“Any crew?” 

“Not on a drone,” Clarkson 
said. “You know that, Tully.” 

“In that case,” I said brightly, 
“there’s no oxygen on board.” 

“Of course not!” 

“And no radiation shielding.” 
“That’s right.” Clarkson stared 
at me. 

“And no insulation.” 

“Just enough to keep the hull 
from melting.” 

“I suppose it took off at top 
acceleration. Thirty-five or so 
Gs.” 

“Sure,” Clarkson said. “That’s 
the economical way, if you have- 
n’t got humans on board. What’s 
eating you?” 

I didn’t answer him. I just 
walked to the jeep and roared 
back to the spec lab. My stomach 
was no longer doing flip-flops. It 
was spinning like a top. 

A human couldn’t have lived 
through that trip. Not a chance. 
Not a chance in ten billion. It 
was a physical impossibility.

W HEN I reached the lab, 
Franklin had completed the 
roof and was on the ground, con- 
necting pipes. It was lunchtime, 
and several of the men from Min- 
ing were helping him. 

“Franklin,” I said. 

“Yes, sir?” 

I took a deep breath. “Frank- 
lin, did you come here on that 
freighter?” 

“No, sir,” he said. “I tried to 
tell you that I didn’t bribe no 
captain, but you wouldn’t — ” 

“In that case,” I spoke very 
slowly, “how did you get here?” 
“By using The Truth!” 

“Could you show me?” 
Franklin considered for a mo- 
ment. “The trip tired me out 
something awful, Mr. Tully,” he 
said, “but I guess I could.” 

And he disappeared. 

I stood there, blinking. Then 
one of the Mining men pointed 
overhead. There was Franklin, 
hovering at about three hundred 
feet. 

In another moment, he was 
standing beside me again, his 
nose pinched and red from the 
cold. 

It looked like instantaneous 
transfer. Oh, brother. 

“Is that The Truth?” I asked. 
“Yes, sir,” Franklin said. “It’s 
a different way of looking at 
things. Once you see it — really 
see it — you can do all sorts of 



things. But they called it a — a 
hallucination on Earth, and they 
said I had to stop hypnotizing 
people and — ■” 

“You can teach this?” I asked. 

“Sure,” Franklin said. “It may 
take a little time, though.” 

“That’s all right. I guess we 
can afford a little time. Yessiree, 
I guess we sure can. Yessiree, a 
little time spent on The Truth 
might be well spent — ” 

I don’t know how much longer 
I would have gone on babbling, 
but Franklin broke in eagerly. 

“Mr. Tully, does that mean I 
can stay?” 

“You can stay, Franklin. As a 
matter of fact, if you try to leave, 
I’ll shoot you.” 

“Oh, thank you, sir! And how 
about my sister? Can she come?” 

“Oh, yes, most certainly,” I 
said. “Your sister can come. Any 
time she — ” 

I heard a startled shriek from 
the Mining men. The hairs on 
the back of my neck stood on 
end, and I turned very slowly. 

There stood a girl, a tall, skin- 
ny girl with eyes as big as sau- 
cers. She stared around like 
a sleepwalker and murmured, 
“Mars! Gol-/ee/” 

Then she turned to me and 
blushed. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” she said. “I — 
I was listening in.”

to his usual standard: a vivid, 
galloping melodrama based on 
his favorite theme of alternate 
worlds. In this one, tyrants from 
the “other” world penetrate ours 
and, by means of a typically Lein-

example of the you-can’t-put-it- 
down school. 

THE VISIONARY NOVELS 
OF GEORGE MACDONALD: 
LILITH and PHANTASTES. 
Edited by Anne Fremantle. Noon- 
day Press, $5.00 

T IMAGINATIVE classics, so- 

called, are only too often dis- 
appointing in their leadenness of 
style and their dated outlook. 
This cannot be said of either of 
these quite remarkably contem- 
porary theological fantasies, 
which were published in the 
Nineteenth Century. 

Lilith in particular is a fascin- 
ating item for a science fiction 
audience; along with its symbol- 
ism and its moral allegorizing 
comes an astonishing amount of 
“machinery” which antedates 
many of our most cherished sci- 
ence-fictional techniques by over 
half a century. 

The modus operand i of this 
story is based on (Murray Lein- 
ster, hold your breath!) the con- 
cept of a parallel world, into 



which one can enter through 
“glowing portals” or — believe it 
or not — correctly polarized mir- 
rors ! 

For an 1890 parson who, in 
addition, was a good friend of 
Lewis Carroll (who never used 
any polarization to get Alice 
through her looking glass!), the 
science fiction “realism”' is almost 
incredible. 

Furthermore, the book is writ- 
ten with excellent taste and clar- 
ity of style. The reader will, I 
suppose, be as bewildered as I by 
some of the author’s short-hand 
metaphysics, the cryptic nature 
of some of his events — but even 
so, this combination of Pilgrim’s 
Progress (a great fairy tale!), 
Alice in Wonderland, and the 
work of C. S. Lewis (Perelandria, 
etc.), is a fascinating piece of 
work. Lewis, incidentally, has 
stated that MacDonald had a 
decisive influence on his own 
writing. 

Phantastes is almost as good, 
though, being much earlier in 
composition, it does not have 
quite the maturity of vision and 
sureness of hand that Lilith has. 
It is also nowhere near as aston- 
ishing a prevision of modern sci- 
ence fiction as is the later book. 

But neither is of merely anti- 
quarian interest. They really hold 
your attention. MacDonald is a 
genuine discovery and very defi- 
nitely worth your time.

THE MAKER OF MOONS 
by Robert W. Chambers. Shroud 
Publishers, $1.00 

T HIS seems to be a month for 
antiques. The present novelet 
was written by the author of The 
King in Yellow (which I have 
always found offensively dull) 
back in 1895. This one is NOT 
dull! As a fantasy mood piece it’s 
excellent, though as science fic- 
tion it’s silly. 

The tale tells of a Chinese 
gold-making sorcerer transplant- 
ed to an estate in, say, rural New 
York, where gentlemen farmer 
hunting is a way of life. The Ori- 
ental fakir tries to undermine our 
economy with fairy gold. The 
story is told with such verisimili- 
tude that, even though you know 
all along that it is as phony as a 
7-cent piece, it really grabs you 
up and carries you along. 

THE BODY SNATCHERS by 
Jack Finney. Dell Books, 25c 

T HERE is absolutely nothing 
wrong with this novel, which 
was first serialized in Collier’s, 
except that it has been done 
again and again and again. Too 
many s-f novels lack outstanding 
originality, but this one lacks it 
to an outstanding degree. 

Of course it is competently 
written (Finney is always an au- 
thentic stylist) and swiftly paced. 

9 * 



The plot revolves around a small 
town in California where people 
seem to be being “taken over” by 
some sort of — well, thing. It 
reminds me a bit of Heinlein’s 
Puppet Masters, though without 
any of his oomph. But it’s worth 
25c. 

A MAN OBSESSED by Alan 
E. Nourse; THE LAST PLANET 
(Star Rangers) by Andre Norton. 
Ace Books, 25c 

fy'OURSE’S original novel, al- 

’ though overwritten, overlong 
for the material, and a bit aim- 
less in plot, is still worth your 
attention, if only for the mood of 
terror it evokes. Dr. Nourse, ex- 
pert in the ways of psychiatry, 
has turned out a thriller of a mad 
world in which the madness is 
based on the damage that can be 
done by men possessed of extra- 
sensory perception gene-linked 
with insanity. At moments, the 
book can really pull you through 
knotholes. 

The Norton tale, originally 
published as a juvenile, is still 
good, simple, uncomplicated sci- 
ence fiction. 

FEW WERE LEFT by Harold 
Rein. John Day, $3.50 

IVfOST first novels show their

this is no exception. The whole 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



story takes place in one of New 
York’s subways, in which a hand- 
ful of survivors of some holocaust 
(probably atomic) struggle in 
separate groups down the pitch- 
black underground and finally, 
when all are together, defeat an 
attempt by a ten-cent tyrant to 
run their lives for them. 

It’s a graphic job of description 
and some of the characters are 
eloquently presented; but the 
doomful earnestness gets so bad- 
ly in the way that you are likely 
to end up being bored.

T regret to report that this col-

that should have been left un- 
turned. The ideas no longer have 
any originality and the style is 
an almost perfect example of the 
early days of science fiction. 

I would have been happy if I 
could have made a better report 
about the work of a man who

UNDERSEA QUEST by Fred-

Gnome Press, $2.50 

T HE story, which deals with 
undersea uranium mining, is 
well plotted, well written, full of 
exciting incidents and rich imagi- 
nation — all one would ask of a 
satisfying juvenile. And yet I’m 
unhappy with it. Why? And do I 
have the right to impose adult 
moral standards on a book for 
youngsters? 

As a grownup who likes the 
feel of freedom, I detest the petri- 
fying process that military acad- 
emies put children through. It 
produces stiff spines, sure, but 
equally rigid minds. This book 
has that kind of us-against-the- 
world attitude. 

On the other hand, kids view 
everything in black and white, 
yay for our side, etc. Which leaves 
me unhappily aware that primi- 
tivism is a necessary precondi- 
tion to civilization.

The Amateurs 



By ALAN COGAN 

Illustrated by DIEHL 



The ultimate show demanded the 
ultimate in showmanship — now if 
only Mr. Sims could measure up! 



T O MR. SIMS, it seemed 
as though they had walked 
along a hundred corridors, 
and as he followed Mr. Hoode, 
he felt as though he were taking 
the last walk to the gallows or 
the electric chair. When the di- 
rector finally led him outside, Mr. 
Sims realized with a slight twinge 
of fear that he hadn’t really ex- 
pected to see daylight again. 

They were in the rich, rolling 
parkland at the rear of the palace 
and walking across the immacu- 
late turf where colored fountains 
frolicked and shimmered in the 
sun. Lilting music floated out 
from a dozen hidden sources. The 



two men sat down on a seat fac- 
ing the palace with its towering 
columns and vast marble steps. 

“It’s a very nice place,” Mr. 
Sims commented, remembering 
that he hadn’t said a word for at 
least five minutes. 

“I suppose it’s all right,” Arthur 
Hoode agreed, his thin nostrils 
twitching condescendingly. He 
was a small, sleek man with a 
habit of emphasizing his words 
with airy gestures of his slim 
hands. “That section of the palace 
is the part I consider most unin- 
teresting. After all, there’s noth- 
ing but row upon row of stuffy 
little rooms where people come 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to die. And they take a long time 
doing it, too!” 

Mr. Sims winced noticeably. 

“You’ll forgive me if I don’t 
appear overly sanctimonious 
about death,” Mr. Hoode said, 
smiling. “It’s just that the other 
directors and myself decided we 
must take a realistic view of the 
situation. A place like this could 
become pretty morbid, you know, 
and there’s actually no reason 
why a guest’s last hours here 
shouldn’t be pleasant and satisfy- 
ing.” 

"OLEASANT and satisfying — 
the key words when you 
spoke of Sunnylands Palace, Mr. 
Sims thought grimly. Everyone 
used them — when not going 
there. 

The words gave him a hol- 
low, frightened feeling inside, per- 
haps because they made him re- 
member the first time he had 
heard them used. 

“It’s a pleasant place and quite 
satisfying,” Dr. Van Stoke had 
said. “There’s no need to think of 
it as some kind of torture camp.” 

“But why should I go there at 
all?” Mr. Sims had asked. “I don’t 
want to die. I’m only fifty-six and 
I’ve got nine more years left.” 

“Try and understand I’m doing 
you a good turn,” the doctor had 
said. “You’ve lived fifty-six good 
years; in your condition, the last 
nine won’t be so good. You’ll have 



pains, attacks, you won’t be able 
to do anything strenuous. You’ll 
hate to live under those condi- 
tions.” 

“I could always give it a try,” 
Mr. Sims had protested. 

Dr. Van Stoke had frowned 
bleakly over the tops of his 
glasses. “I know I’m a friend and 
family doctor,” the frown had 
said, “but I’m also District 
Referee under the Euthanasian 
Legislation and you are becom- 
ing a burden to society. So don’t 
make my job any more difficult.” 

He had signed his name at the 
bottom of the form. 

And Mr. Sims had had a hol- 
low, anxious feeling ever since. 

“There’s one thing I haven’t 
found out yet,” he said to Mr. 
Hoode. “Is it in order for me to 
ask how and when I can expect 
to die?” 

“Certainly,” Mr. Hoode said. 
“It’s the reason I brought you 
here to talk. Y ou see, anyone 
sent here under the Legislation 
is given a completely free choice 
as to the manner of his departure. 
Most people, although they real- 
ize this, show a distressing lack 
of imagination when the time 
comes. They seem unable to 
think beyond the ordinary 
methods of taking a pill, or a 
needle, or a poisoned cocktail.” 

“I can’t say I’d thought about 
it, either,” Mr. Sims admitted. 

“We have a service to assist

you,” said the director. “We of 
the Sunnylands staff have dis- 
covered what you might call a 
Philosophy of Dying. For in- 
stance, if a man lives an active 
life, there’s no reason why he 
should be subjected to a sneak- 
ing prick of a needle in his sleep 
just because he reaches the age 
of sixty-five. We discovered that 
a few people objected strongly to 
such methods. There are some 
people who would prefer to die 
fighting. We had a couple who 
chose the firing squad, for in- 
stance. Another desired the 
guillotine and nothing would 
satisfy him but a ride to his fate 
in a real tumbril. Because of 
these — ah — pioneers, our ad- 
visory bureau has been set up.” 

“You mean you obliged them 
. with a guillotine and every- 
thing?” Mr. Sims asked. 

“Certainly, though most choose 
the sneaking, cowardly way out. 
As far as I am concerned, they 
died as they lived — ignomin- 
ously! It’s depressing. We have 
the best accommodation, food, 
entertainment, everything the 
guest requires during his three 
days here; then they go ahead 
and die their miserable deaths. 
Somehow it makes all the luxury 
seem like pink sugar frosting 
around a rotten cake. That’s why 
we’re always happy to find a 
guest with the proper spirit.” Mr. 
Hoode said. 



M R. SIMS listened in silence 
to the sales talk, wondering 
absent-mindedly what the direc- 
tor’s personal interest was in 
other people’s death. 

“I took the liberty of looking 
up your record,” Mr. Hoode con- 
tinued. “I picked you out for a 
personal talk because I see you 
led an interesting life.” He paused 
in recollection with a theatrically 
thoughtful finger pressed to his 
chin, his eyes gazing skyward. 
“You made a small fortune in 
oil in Central America before you 
were twenty. That was followed 
by more success in hemelium 
mining in Northern Canada. An 
excellent Third World War 
record, too. Founder of Trans- 
continental Rocket Lines. Co- 
builder of the Venus rocket. Oh, 
and a dozen other things. Quite 
a career!” 

Mr. Sims brightened a little. 
He smiled modestly. 

“Too bad you had to come 
here at fifty-six,” Mr. Hoode re- 
marked. “Heaven knows what 
you might have done with those 
last nine years. Heart trouble, 
wasn’t it?” 

“So I’ve been told,” Mr. Sims 
said, slipping back into his for- 
mer glum mood. He still did not 
believe he was a sick man, but 
perhaps this was because things 
had moved too fast and he had 
not been given enough time to 
get used to the idea. 



THE AMATEURS

“It’s a serious cardiac condi- 
tion,” Dr. Van Stoke had told 
him at the annual examination, 
“due to an over-active life. I’ll 
have to recommend you for Sun- 
nylands.” 

And that had been the first 
mention of the subject. 

“But I never had heart trouble 
in my life!” 

“The graphs show the condi- 
tion clearly. There’s nothing any- 
one can do to remedy it. I’ll have 
to submit your name.” 

He had protested — threat- 
ened — pleaded. 

“Overpopulation! Elimination 
of needless suffering! Burden to 
society! Duty to humanity!” The 
cliches had tripped glibly off the 
doctor’s tongue as he signed the 
form. “Will you please send in 
a member of the family? I’ll give 
him the final instructions. Save 
you the trouble of worrying over 
little details during the final 
weeks.” 

Since then, things had moved 
more swiftly behind the scenes 
and he had had to do nothing 
except prepare himself — or 
adopt a realistic attitude, as Mr. 
Hoode would have described it. 
But he had lived too much to 
allow him to get used to the idea 
of dying in two short weeks. He 
hadn’t even started to get realis- 
tic about it, which was probably 
why he could sit talking so calm- 
ly about death at that moment. 

98 



66 W E COULD give your life 
W a climax,” the director 
was saying. “A man like you 
shouldn’t just fade away in one 
of those little cubicles.” He 
waved a hand in the direction of 
the shaded windows at the rear 
of the palace. “You should die 
magnificently!” 

“Magnificently?” Mr. Sims re- 
peated. “What did you have in 
mind?” 

“It’s what you have in mind 
that counts. I can offer you a lot 
of advice, but the final choice is 
yours. For instance, a large num- 
ber of men like to die in some sort 
of combat, with guns or swords, 
or even with animals. We had 
one man who fought a tiger. An- 
other fulfilled a life-long ambi- 
tion to play the role of bullfighter. 
Perhaps I should explain that the 
government allows each guest a 
generous sum of money to pay 
for his departure. As most people 
do not use one hundredth of this 
sum, we have a rather large fund 
at the disposal of those who want 
to use it. 

“The bullfighter was a good 
example,” he went on. “We had 
a large ring built for him. He was 
given horses, uniforms, picadores, 
and a bull specially imported 
from ‘ Spain. It was a wonderful 
afternoon.” He paused in con- 
templation of the memory, while 
Mr. Sims looked on, tactfully re- 
fraining from asking the outcome. 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Another time, we had a group 
of old soldiers who wanted to die 
in battle,” Mr. Hoode added. “We 
built them an old-fashioned con- 
crete blockhouse, then gave them 
authentic uniforms, machine-guns, 
grenades and rifles, and had one 
group attacking and the other de- 
fending.” 

“Did they actually volunteer 
for that?” Mr. Sims asked. 

“Of course, and I’ll swear they 
enjoyed every minute of it. Right 
down to the last man. As a matter 
of fact, we’re planning the same 
thing on a larger scale with a re- 
enactment of Custer’s Last Stand 
to be held in 2013. One of the 
men in Research is working full 
time on that project. So far, we 
have a tentative list of 138 names. 
It’ll be held in the park over 
there.” He waved gaily in the 
direction of the quiet meadow 
which would one day become an- 
other Little Big Horn. 

Mr. Sims moved along the seat 
slightly, as though his companion 
had started to smell. It was as if, 
for the first time, he had noticed 
the glazed, visionary look in Mr. 
Hoode’s eye. The director, he 
realized, would be capable of re- 
enacting Hiroshima if given the 
required number of volunteers. 

“I’ll have to leave you, I’m 
afraid,” said Mr. Hoode, standing 
up. “But if you’d like to think 
the matter over some more, I can 
offer you a fine selection of books 



to read about famous deaths, 
duels, acts of heroism and such 
throughout history.” 

“It’s an interesting notion,” Mr. 
Sims said. “I’ll think about it.” 

"jl/I’R. SIMS tried to avoid the 
director all that day and all 
the following morning. He tried 
hard to convince himself that 
this was because he disliked the 
other’s bloodthirsty tendencies, 
although he knew the truth was 
that his choice of departure was 
a cowardly one. Nevertheless, he 
argued with himself, it was his 
choice, his death, and his mind 
was made up. Besides, he felt 
lonely and this might be an op- 
portunity to see the family again, 
even though they probably 
wouldn’t like it. 

It was the director who finally 
located Mr. Sims. “Are you en- 
joying your stay here?” he asked 
heartily. Mr. Sims winced as 
though the cold hand of death 
itself had slapped him on the 
back. 

“Have you come to any deci- 
sion yet?” 

Mr. Sims nodded. “Yes, I 
looked at the book last night and 
decided on Socrates. Just a sim- 
ple cup of hemlock.” 

A slight frown shadowed the 
director’s features. Was it con- 
tempt, Mr. Sims wondered, or 
disappointment because he had 
failed in his attempts to make 



THE AMATEURS

poisoning seem a socially inferior 
way of dying? Nothing glamor- 
ous about such a departure, he 
realized. No disdainful refusal of 
the blindfold when gazing brave- 
ly into the leveled muzzles of the 
firing squad. No bullfight, armed 
combat, duel or ferocious carni- 
vores. 

The director shrugged. “Well, 
it’s tranquil and dignified, I sup- 
pose,” he conceded finally. Then 
the practical streak in his nature 
came to the forefront and his 
mind ran quickly over the possi- 
bilities. “If I remember correctly, 
Socrates died in the company of 
a number of good friends. They 
discussed philosophy.” 

“I’ll have my family instead. 
I’ve no idea what we’ll talk about. 
Their names are on this list.” 

“It’s irregular — ” 

“Nevertheless, I want them 
here.” 

“All right,” said Mr. Hoode, 
disappointed. “I’ll send for them 
today. I’ll also see the lab about 
some hemlock and something au- 
thentic to hold it in — an 
amphora or whatever the Greeks 
used. By the way, I’m not too 
well acquainted with Socrates. 
Are there any unusual details?” 
“If there are, forget them,” Mr. 
Sims said. “The family and the 
hemlock will be sufficient.” 

Mr. Hoode sniffed peevishly. 
“As you wish. Be ready tomor- 
row.” 



T HE rough woven garment was 
a concession to Mr. Hoode, 
who said it was Grecian, and Mr. 
Sims wore it to make up for any 
annoyance he may have caused 
the director. It was rather itchy 
and much too warm, he thought, 
as he waited by the fountain at 
the far end of the park. The hem- 
lock was in a bronze goblet on 
the parapet beside him. The fam- 
ily would be here soon. He won- 
dered how they would feel about 
being dragged way out here. 

They arrived a half hour later: 
Cousin Nat, his two nephews, 
George and Alec, their wives, and 
George’s five-year-old, Mike. Mr. 
Hoode was also with them, but 
he left the party as soon as he 
had shown them where Mr. Sims 
was waiting. 

The meeting was restrained. 
Clearly they were not happy 
about making the trip. There 
were no smiles of greeting; only 
young Mike showed any distinct 
interest. He sat down at Mr. Sims’ 
feet, playing havoc with the lawn 
with a toy dagger. 

“Where’s the poison, Grand- 
pa?” he asked eagerly. 

Mr. Sims lifted the boy up on 
to his knee and rumpled his hair 
playfully in a feeble attempt to 
ease the tension. The others stood 
around silently watching. No one 
made any move to sit down. It 
was their way of telling him they 
hoped they wouldn’t have to wait 



too 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



too long. Mr. Sims suddenly 
wished he were in one of the quiet 
rooms of the palace, alone. 

Cousin Nat was the first one to 
break the awkward silence. “Who 
in hell was that madman who 
brought us over here?” 

“That’s Mr. Hoode, the direc- 
tor,” Mr. Sims explained. “He’s 
quite an artist in his way.” 

“He’s insane!” Nat said flatly. 
“All the way over, he talked about 
nothing but dying. Told us we 
could come here and die any way 
we wanted. If any of us wanted 
to go out like Early Christians, 
he would be only too happy to 
set up an arena for us. He even 
asked me if I wanted to put my 
name down for a rehash of Cus- 
ter’s Last Stand for 2013. With 
real bullets!” He passed his hand 
nervously through his thinning 
hair. “For God’s sake, he must 
think I want to get scalped!” 
“Didn’t Dr. Van Stoke come 
with you?” Mr. Sims asked. “I 
wanted him to see the place he 
sends everyone.” 

“He went on an ocean cruise,” 
young Mike said. 

“Dr. Van Stoke? You mean he 
left his practice?” 

“Yeah,” the little boy answered. 
“Another doctor took his place.” 
Mr. Sims turned to the others 
for corroboration. “Is that right? 
I didn’t think Van Stoke was a 
rich man. He was only around 
forty.” 



“He went with the money 
Uncle Nat gave him,” the boy 

said. 

“That’ll be enough, Michael,” 
Nat ordered sternly. 

Tt/TR. SIMS laughed. “You’re 
mistaken, Mike. Uncle Nat 
wouldn’t give the doctor any 
money. He hasn’t even got 
enough for himself.” 

“But he quit his job yester- 
day,” said the boy. 

Nat’s voice cut in sharply. 
“That’s enough from you. You 
know what they say about little 
boys.” 

Mr. Sims looked steadily at 
Nat as though seeing him for the 
first time. His cousin gazed back, 
half-sullen, half-defiant. 

“It certainly didn’t take you 
long to get your hands on the 
money,” Mr. Sims said. “It looks 
as if I can’t die soon enough. But 
I still don’t see where Dr. Van 
Stoke comes into — ” 

Then suddenly there was no 
need to ask. The answer was clear 
on Nat’s tight, sullen face. 

Mr. Sims turned to the others 
for help and froze as identical 
expressions stared back coldly 
from each of them, piercing him 
with their long-hidden envy of 
his success, their pent-up hatred 
of their dependence on him. 

A choking, frightened sound 
came from deep in Mr. Sims’ 
throat. “For God’s sake! How 



THE AMATEURS

much did you pay him to put me 
away?” 

He jumped quickly off the 
parapet, knocking the little boy 
to the ground, and hurled the 
hemlock into the fountain. He 
pushed his way past them and 
started to run. Then the woven 
garment twisted about his legs. 
He tried to lift it clear, but his 
foot caught in the hem and he 
stumbled. 

Nat was the first to move. He 
picked up the little toy dagger 
and fell on the struggling man. 
Without hesitating, he plunged 
the knife between Mr. Sims’ 
shoulder blades and held it till 
the older man was still. Then he 
stabbed again, without malice, 
without any emotion . again 
and again. The blade made an 
odd ripping sound each time it 
pierced the woven robe. 

All of them looked away. One 
of the women leaned over the 
parapet, sick. 

W/"HEN he was finally done, 
" Nat stood up and cleaned 
the knife on the grass and then 
motioned them all back toward 
the palace. 

Mr. Hoode met them as they 
walked through the foyer. “Ah, 
Socrates’ friends!” he said to Nat, 
who was dabbing at the front of 
his coat with a piece of tissue. 
“Was everything in order?” 

“There was a slight change of 



plan,” Nat said. “He decided at 
the last moment to make it Julius 
Caesar.” He held the knife up in 
explanation. 

“Julius Caesar! But — ” 

But they were gone, filing out 
through the front door, the 
women sobbing in their handker- 
chiefs. No one looked back. 

The door hissed quietly shut. 
Mr. Hoode started at the sound 
and then walked slowly into his 
office, seized by,a cold, limp rage. 
From his window, he could see 
them going down the driveway. 

“Amateurs,” he spat after them 
with deep disgust. “Damned, 
lousy, unimaginative amateurs!”

PREFERRED RISK 

PART 2 OF A 4-PART SERIAL 

By EDSON McCANN 

The world, completely insured, was better off than ever before, 
yet why had there been a little war? Why was Rena uninsurable? 
Why were the vaults huge enough to hold the entire human race?

romantic, war-ravaged Naples, on 
an errand of high adventure in 
the service of — 

The Company, the giant com- 
bine of insurance corporations 
which protects the world by in- 
suring every one of its activities. 
It is the finest work of mankind; 
the Company has once and for 
all called a halt to war, poverty, 
disease and danger, by the most 
modern application of actuarial 
methods. Everyone knows this to 
be true, but I find that in Naples 
there are persons superstition- 
ridden enough to doubt it. Among 
them is a girl — 

Rena, who thinks there is 
something sinister in the fact that 
Naples has just passed through 
a war - — without recognizing how 
tiny it was — and that she and 
her father are in want because 
they are uninsurables, who hints 
that my wife died of a prevent- 
able disease, which is nonsense, of 
course, because — 

Marianna, my wife, had been 
terrified of the vaults and had 
chosen to risk being one of the 
very few malignancy cases that 
don’t respond to treatment. And 
she’d died unnecessarily because 
she had been one of the few. 

Luigi Zorchi confuses and 
alarms me even more than Rena, 
however. He makes a career of 
collecting on accident claims. 
There is nothing fraudulent in 
his accidents — when he receives 

106 



damages for a lost limb, the limb 
is actually lost — but he possess- 
es the capacity of regrowing sev- 
ered members or organs to the 
same degree that a salamander 
has! Worse still, I am dismayed 
by the insistence of Zorchi and 
Rena that the Company is cor- 
rupt and cynical. 

The Clinics are their particu- 
lar target. These are the vaults 
for suspended animation, where 
persons suffering from incurable 
diseases are kept until such time 
as medical science can cure them, 
or to allow radiation and such 
to go below the danger point. 
How could so humane a project 
possibly be considered evil? 

Gogarty, the Regional Direc- 
tor of the Company, is a problem. 
The Company shouldn’t tolerate 
anyone so given to comfort and 
luxury instead of service. Why 
does it? 

Hammond, the Caserta area 
Sub-director, seems better disci- 
plined at first, but disappears 
from my side under odd circum- 
stances. But just when my confu- 
sion is at its worst, good news 
comes in the form of — 

Underwriter Defoe, a high 
executive of the Company and 
my late wife’s distant relative, 
who got me into Cadet School in 
the first place. I hurry to meet 
him at the Clinic, hoping he will 
straighten me out. But what he 
has to tell me instead is blunt 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and shocking: Hammond’s disap- 
pearance was due to murder! 

V 

H AMMOND dead! He had had 
his faults, but he was an 
officer of the Company and a man 
I had met. Dead! 

I asked, “How? What hap- 
pened?” 

“Perhaps you can tell me that, 
Thomas,” said Defoe. 

I sat startledly erect, shocked 
by the significance of the words. 
I said hotly, “Damn it, Mr. Defoe, 
you know I had nothing to do 
with this! I’ve been all over the 
whole thing with you and I 
thought you were on my side! 
Just because I said a lot of crazy 
things after Marianna died 
doesn’t mean I’m anti-Company 
— and it certainly doesn’t mean 
I’d commit murder. If you think 
that, then why the devil did you 
put me in cadet school?” 

Defoe merely raised his hand 
by bending the wrist slightly; it 
was enough to stop me, though. 
“Gently, Thomas. I don’t think 
you did it — that much should 
be obvious. And I put you in 
cadet school because I had work 
for you.” 

“But you said I knew some- 
thing I was holding back.” 

Defoe waggled the hand re- 
provingly. “I said you might be 
able to tell me who killed Ham- 



mond. And so you might — but 
not yet. I count heavily on you 
for help in this area, Thomas. 
There are two urgent tasks to be 
done. Hammond’s death — ” he 
paused and shrugged, and the 
shrug was all of Hammond’s epi- 
taph — “is only an incident in a 
larger pattern; we need to work 
out the pattern itself.” 

He glanced again at the typed 
list Susan had handed him. “I 
find that I can stay in the Naples 
area for only a short time; the 
two tasks must be done before I 
leave. I shall handle one myself. 
The other I intend to delegate 
to you. 

“First we have the unfortunate 
situation in regard to the state of 
public morale. Unfortunate? Per- 
haps I should say disgraceful. 
There is quite obviously a nu- 
cleus of troublemakers at work, 
Thomas, and Gogarty has not 
had the wit to find them and take 
the appropriate steps. Someone 
else must. Second, this Zorchi is 
an unnecessary annoyance. I do 
not propose to let the Company 
be annoyed, Thomas. Which as- 
signment would you prefer?” 

I said hesitantly, “I don’t know 
if Mr. Gogarty would like me 
to — ” 

“Gogarty is an ass! If he had 
not blundered incessantly since 
he took over the district, I should 
not have had to drop important 
work to come here.” 



PREFERRED RISK 



107 



I thought for a second. Digging 
out an undercover ring of trouble- 
makers didn’t sound particularly 
easy. On the other hand, I had 
already tried my luck with 
Zorchi. 

“Perhaps you’d better try 
Zorchi,” I said. 

“Try?” Defoe allowed himself 
to look surprised. “As you wish. 
I think you will learn something 
from watching me handle it, 
Thomas. Shall we join Signore 
Zorchi now?” 

“He’s here?” 

Defoe said impatiently, “Of 
course, Thomas. Come along.” 

^ ORCHI’S secretary was there, 
too. He was in a small ante- 
room, sitting on a hard wooden 
chair; as we passed him, I saw 
the hostility in his eyes. He didn’t 
say a word. 

Beyond him, in an examination 
room, was Zorchi, slim, naked and 
hideous, sitting on the edge of a 
surgical cot and trying not to 
look ill at ease. He had been 
shaved from head to knee stumps. 
Esthetically, at least, it had been 
a mistake. I never saw such a 
collection of skin eruptions on a 
human. 

He burst out, faster than my 
language-school Italian could fol- 
low, in a stream of argument and 
abuse. Defoe listened icily for a 
moment, then shut him up in 
Italian as good as his own. “An- 

108 



swer questions; otherwise keep 
quiet. I will not warn you again.” 

I don’t know if even Defoe 
could have stopped Zorchi under 
normal conditions. But there is 
something about being naked in 
the presence of fully dressed op- 
ponents that saps the will; and 
I guessed, too, that the shaving 
had mhde Zorchi feel nakeder 
than ever before in his life. I 
could see why he’d worn a beard 
and I wished he still had it. 

“Dr. Lawton,” said Defoe, 
“have you completed your exami- 
nation of the insured?” 

A youngish medical officer of 
the Company said, “Yes, sir. I 
have the slides and reports right 
here; they just came up from the 
laboratory.” He handed a stapled 
collection of photographic prints 
and papers to Defoe, who took 
his own good time to examine 
them while the rest of us stood 
and waited. 

Defoe finally put the papers 
down and nodded. “In a word, 
this bears out our previous dis- 
cussion.” 

Lawton nodded. “If you will 
observe his legs, you will see that 
the skin healing is complete; al- 
ready a blastema has formed 
and — ” 

“I know,” Defoe said impatient- 
ly. “Signore Zorchi, I regret to 
say that I have bad news for 
you.” 

Zorchi waved his hand defiant-

ly. “You are the bad news.” 

Defoe ignored him. “You have 
a grave systemic imbalance. 
There is great danger of serious 
ill effects.” 

“To what?” snarled Zorchi. 
“The Company’s bank account?” 
“No, Zorchi. To your life.” De- 
foe shook his head. “There are 
indications of malignancy.” 

“Malignancy?” Zorchi looked 
startled. “What kind? Do you 
mean cancer?” 

“Exactly.” Defoe patted his 
papers. “You see, Zorchi, healthy 
human flesh does not grow like 
a salamander’s tail.” 

T HE phone rang; impeccable 
in everything, Defoe waited 
while Dr. Lawton nervously an- 
swered it. Lawton said a few 
short words, listened for a mo- 
ment and hung up, looking 
worried. 

He said: “The crowd outside 
is getting rather large. That was 
the expediter-captain from the 
main gate. He says — ” 

“I presume he has standing 
orders,” Defoe said. “We need not 
concern ourselves with that, need 
we?” 

“Well — ” The doctor looked 
unhappy. 

“Now, Zorchi,” Defoe went on, 
dismissing Lawton utterly, “do 
you enjoy life?” 

“I despise it!” Zorchi spat to 
emphasize how much. 



“But you cling to it. You would 
not like to die, would you? Worse 
still, you would not care to live 
indefinitely with carcinoma eat- 
ing you piece by piece.” 

Zorchi just glowered suspi- 
ciously. 

“Perhaps we can cure you, 
however,” Defoe went on reflec- 
tively. “It is by no means certain. 
I don’t want to raise false hopes. 
But there is the possibility — ” 
“The possibility that you will 
cure me of collecting on my poli- 
cies, eh?” Zorchi demanded bel- 
ligerently. “You are crazy, Defoe. 
Never!” 

Defoe looked at him for a 
thoughtful moment. To Lawton, 
he said: “Have you this man’s 
claim warranty? It has the usual 
application for medical treat- 
ment, I presume?” He nodded as 
Lawton confirmed it. “You see, 
Mr. Zorchi? As a matter of rou- 
tine, no claim can be paid unless 
the policyholder submits to our 
medical care. You signed the 
usual form, so — ” 

“One moment! You people 
never put me through this be- 
fore! Did you change the con- 
tract on me?” 

“No, Signore Zorchi. The same 
contract, but this time we will 
enforce it. I think I should warn 
you of something, though.” 

He riffled through the papers 
and found a photographic print 
to show Zorchi. “This picture

isn’t you, Signore. It is a picture 
of a newt. The doctor will explain 
it to you.” 

The print was an eight-by-ten 
glossy of a little lizard with 
something odd about its legs. 
Puzzled, Zorchi held it as though 
the lizard were alive and veno- 
mous. But as the doctor spoke, the 
puzzlement turned into horror 
and fury. 

“What Mr. Defoe means,” said 
Lawton, “is that totipotency — 
that is, the ability to regenerate 
lost tissues, as you can, even 
when entire members are in- 
volved — is full of unanswered 
riddles. We have found, for in- 
stance, that X-ray treatment on 
your leg helps a new leg to form 
rapidly, just as it does on the 
leg of the salamanders. The radi- 
ation appears to stimulate the 
formation of the blastema, which 
- — well, never mind the technical 
part. It speeds things up.” 

His eyes gleamed with scien- 
tific interest. “But we tried the 
experiment of irradiating limbs 
that had not been severed. It 
worked the same way, oddly 
enough. New limbs were generat- 
ed even though the old ones were 
still there. That’s why the sala- 
mander in the photo has four 
hands on one of its limbs — nine 
legs altogether, counting that 
half-formed one just beside the 
tail. Curious-looking little beast, 
isn’t it?” 



D EFOE cleared his throat. “I 
only mention, Signore, that 
the standard treatment for malig- 
nancy is X-radiation.” 

Zorchi’s eyes flamed — rage 
battling it out with terror. He 
said shrilly, “But you can’t make 
a laboratory animal out of me! 
I’m a policyholder!” 

“Nature did it, Signore Zorchi, 
not us,” Defoe said. 

Zorchi’s eyes rolled up in his 
head and closed; for a moment, 
I thought he had fainted and 
leaped forward to catch him rath- 
er than let his legless body crash 
to the floor. But he hadn’t fainted. 
He was muttering, half aloud, 
sick with fear, “For the love of 
Mary, Defoe! Please, please, I 
beg you! Please!” 

It was too much for me. I said, 
shaking with rage, “Mr. Defoe, 
you can’t force this man to under- 
go experimental radiation that 
might make a monster out of 
him! I insist that you reconsider!” 
Defoe threw his head back. 
“What, Thomas?” he snapped. 

I said firmly, “He has no one 
here to advise him — I’ll take 
the job. Zorchi, listen to me! 
You’ve signed the treatment ap- 
plication and he’s right enough 
about that — you can’t get out 
of it. But you don’t have to take 
this treatment! Every policy- 
holder has the right to refuse any 
new and unguaranteed course of 
treatment, no matter what the

circumstances. All you’ve got to 
do is agree to go into suspension 
in the va — in the clinic here, 
pending such time as your condi- 
tion can be infallibly cured. Do 
it, man! Don’t let them make you 
a freak — demand suspension! 
What have you got to lose?” 

I never saw a man go so to 
pieces as Zorchi, when he realized 
how nearly Defoe had trapped 
him into becoming a guinea pig. 
Whimpering thanks to me, he 
hastily signed the optional agree- 
ment for suspended animation 
and, as quickly as I could, I left 
him there. 

Defoe followed me. We passed 
the secretary in the anteroom 
while Dr. Lawton was explaining 
the circumstances to him; the 
man was stricken with astonish- 
ment, almost too paralyzed to 
sign the witnessing form Defoe 
had insisted on. I knew the form 
well — I had been about to sign 
one for Marianna when, at the 
last moment, she decided against 
the vaults in favor of the experi- 
mental therapy that hadn’t 
worked. 

Outside in the hall, Defoe 
stopped and confronted me. I 
braced myself for the blast to end 
all blasts. 

I could hardly believe my eyes. 
The great stone face was smiling! 

“Thomas,” he said inexplicably, 
“that was masterful. I couldn’t 
have done better myself.” 



W E walked silently through 
the huge central waiting 
room of the clinic. 

There should have been scores 
of relatives of suspendees milling 
around, seeking information — 
there was, I knew, still a steady 
shipment of suspendees coming 
in from the local hospitals; I had 
seen it myself. But there were 
hardly more than a dozen or so 
persons in sight, with a single 
clerk checking their forms and 
answering their questions. 

It was too quiet. Defoe thought 
so, too; I saw his frown. 

Now that I had had a few 
moments to catch my breath, I 
realized that I had seen a master 
judoist at work. It was all out 
of the textbooks — as a fledgling 
Claims Adjuster, I had had the 
basic courses in handling difficult 
cases — but not one man in a 
million could apply textbook rules 
as skillfully and successfully as 
Defoe did with Zorchi. 

Push a man hard and he will 
lunge back; push hirn hard 
enough and persistently enough, 
and he will lunge back farther 
than his vision carries him, right 
to the position you planned for 
him in the first place. And I, of 
course, had been only a tool in 
Defoe’s hand; by interceding for 
Zorchi, I had tricked the man 
into the surrender Defoe wanted. 



PREFERRED RISK 



111 



And he had complimented me 
for it! 

I couldn’t help wondering, 
though, whether the compliment 
Defoe gave me was part of some 
still subtler scheme . 

Defoe nodded curtly to the ex- 
pediter-captain at the door, who 
saluted and pressed the teleswitch 
that summoned Defoe’s limou- 
sine. 

TTkEFOE turned to me. “I have 
business in Rome and must 
leave at once. You will have to 
certify Zorchi’s suspension this 
afternoon; since I won’t be here, 
you’ll have to come back to the 
clinic for it. After that, Thomas, 
you can begin your assignment.” 
I said uncertainly, “What — 
where shall I begin?” 

One eyebrow lifted a trifle. 
“Where? Wherever you think 
proper, Thomas. Or must I handle 
this myself?” 

The proper answer, and the 
one I longed to make, was “Yes.” 
Instead I said, “Not at all, Mr. 
Defoe. It’s only that I didn’t even 
know there was an undercover 
group until you told me about it 
a few moments ago; I don’t know 
exactly where to start. Gogarty 
never mentioned — ” 

“Gogarty,” he cut in, “is very 
likely to be relieved as District 
Administrator before long. I 
should like to replace him with 
someone already on the scene — ” 



he glanced at me to be sure I 
understood — “provided, that is, 
that I can find someone of proven 
competence. Someone who has 
the ability to handle this situa- 
tion without the necessity of my 
personal intervention.” 

The limousine arrived then, 
with an armed expediter riding 
beside the chauffeur. Defoe al- 
lowed me to open the door for 
him and follow him in. 

“Do you understand me?” he 
asked as the driver started off. 

“I think so,” I said. 

“Good. I do not suppose that 
Gogarty has given you any in- 
formation about the malcontents 
in this area.” 

“No.” 

“It may be for the best; his in- 
formation is clearly not good.” 
Defoe stared broodingly out the 
window at the silent groups of 
men and women on the grass be- 
fore the clinic. “Your information 
is there,” he said as they passed 
out of sight. “Learn what you 
can. Act when you know enough. 
And, Thomas — ” 

“Yes?” 

“Have you given thought to 
your future?” 

I shifted uncomfortably. “Well, 
I’ve only been a Claims Adjuster 
a little while, you know. I sup- 
pose that perhaps I might eventu- 
ally get promoted, even become a 
District Administrator — ”

He looked at me impersonally. 
“Dream higher,” he advised. 

I stood w£» tc hmg after Defoe’s 
limousine, from the marquee of 
the hotel where he had left me to 
take a roo m and freshen up. 
Dream higher. He had the gift 
of intoxicati° n - 

Higher than a District Ad- 
ministrator! It could mean only 
— the Hom e Office. 

Well, it was not impossible, 
after all. Th e Home Office jobs 
had to go to someone; the super- 
men who held them now — the 
Defoes and the Carmodys and 
the dozen or more others who 
headed up departments or filled 
seats on the Council of Under- 
writers — couldn’t live forever. 
And the jobs had to be filled by 
someone. 

Why not fne? Only one reason, 
really. I wa s n °t a career man. 
I hadn’t had the early academy 
training froP adolescence on; I 
had come t° the service of the 
Company it?elf relatively late in 
life. The calendar legislated 
against me. 

Of course, I thought to myself, 
I was in a pretty good position, 
in a way, be cause of Defoe’s evi- 
dent interest in me. With him 
helping and counseling me, it 
might be easier. 

I thought that and then I 
stopped myself, shocked. I was 
thinking in terms of personal pre- 



ferment. That was not the Com- 
pany way! If I had learned any- 
thing in my training, I had 
learned that Advancement was 
on merit alone. 

Advancement had to be on 
merit alone . else the Company 
became an oligarchy, deadly and 

self-perpetuating. 

Shaken, I sat in the dingy little 
hotel room that was the best the 
town of Anzio had for me and 
opened my little Black Book. I 
thumbed through the fine-printed 
pages of actuarial tables and 
turned to the words of Millen 
Carmody, Chief Underwriter, in 
the preface. They were the words 
that had been read to me and the 
others at our graduation at the 
Home Office, according to the 
tradition: 

Remember always that the 
Company serves humanity, not 
the reverse. The Company’s work 
is the world’s work- The Com- 
pany can end, forever, the men- 
ace of war and devastation; but 
it must not substitute a tyranny 
of its own. Corruption breeds ty- 
rants. Corruption has no place in 
the Company. 

They were glorious words. I read 
them over again, and stared at 
the portrait of Underwriter Car- 
mody that was the frontispiece of 
the handbook. It was a face to 
inspire trust — wise and human, 
grave, but with warmth in the 



PREFERRED RISK 



113 



wide-spaced eyes. 

Millen Carmody was not a man 
you could doubt. As long as men 
like him ran the Company — 
and he was the boss of them all, 
the Chief Underwriter, the high- 
est position the Company had to 
offer — there could be no ques- 
tion of favoritism or corruption. 

A FTER eating, I shaved, 
cleaned up a little and went 
back to the clinic. 

There was trouble in the air, 
no question of it. More expediters 
were in view, scattered around 
the entrance, a dozen, cautious 
yards away from the nearest 
knots of civilians. Cars with no 
official company markings, but 
with armor-glass so thick that it 
seemed yellow, were parked at 
the corners. And people were 
everywhere. 

People who were quiet. Too 
quiet. There were some women 
— but not enough to make the 
proportion right. And there were 
no children. 

I could almost feel the thrust 
of their eyes as I entered the 
clinic. 

Inside, the aura of strain was 
even denser. If anything, the 
place looked more normal than 
it had earlier; there were more 
people. The huge waiting room 
was packed and a dozen sweating 
clerks were interviewing long 
lines of persons. But here, as out- 

114 



side, the feeling was wrong; the 
crowds weren’t noisy enough; 
they lacked the nervous boister- 
ousness they should have had. 

Dr. Lawton looked worried. He 
greeted me and showed me to a 
small room near the elevators. 
There was a cocoon of milky 
plastic on a wheeled table; I 
looked closer, and inside the co- 
coon, recognizable through the 
clear plastic over the face, was 
the waxlike body of Luigi Zorchi. 
The eyes were closed and he 
was completely still. I would have 
thought him dead if I had not 
known he was under the influ- 
ence of the drugs used in the 
suspension of life in the vaults. 

I said: “Am I supposed to 
identify him or something?” 

“We know who he is,” Lawton 
snorted. “Sign the commitment, 
that’s all.” 

I signed the form he handed 
me, attesting that Luigi Zorchi, 
serial number such-and-such, had 
requested and was being granted 
immobilization and suspension in 
lieu of cash medical benefits. 
They rolled the stretcher-cart 
away, with its thick foam-plastic 
sack containing the inanimate 
Zorchi. 

“Anything else?” I asked. 

Lawton shook his head mood- 
ily. “Nothing you can help with. 
I told Defoe this was going to 
happen!” 

“What?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He glared at me. “Man, didn’t 
you just come in through the 
main entrance? Didn’t you see 
that mob?” 

“Well, I wouldn’t call it a mob,” 
I began. 

“You wouldn’t now,” he broke 
in. “But you will soon enough. 
They’re working themselves up. 
Or maybe they’re waiting for 
something. But it means trouble, 
I promise, and I warned Defoe 
about it. And he just stared at 
me as if I was some kind of de- 
generate.” 

I SAID sharply, “What are you 
afraid of? Right outside, you’ve 
got enough expediters to fight a 
war.” 

“Afraid? Me?” He looked in- 
sulted. “Do you think I’m worried 
about my own skin, Wills? No, 
sir. But do you realize that we 
have suspendees here who need 
protection? Eighty thousand of 
them. A mob like that — ” 

“Eighty thousand?” I stared at 
him. The war had lasted only a 
few weeks! 

“Eighty thousand. A little more, 
if anything. And every one of 
them is a ward of the Company 
as long as he’s suspended. Just 
think of the damage suits, Wills.” 
I said, still marveling at the 
enormous number of casualties 
out of that little war, “Surely the 
suspendees are safe here, aren’t 
they?” 



“Not against mobs. The vaults 
can handle anything that might 
happen in the way of disaster. I 
don’t think an H-bomb right 
smack on top of them would dis- 
turb more than the top two or 
three decks at most. But you 
never know what mobs will do. If 
they once get in here — And 
Defoe wouldn’t listen to me!” 

As I went back into the hall, 
passing the main entrance, the 
explosion burst. 

I stared out over the heads of 
the dreadfully silent throng in 
the entrance hall, looking toward 
the glass doors, as was everyone 
else inside. Beyond the doors, an 
arc of expediters was retreating 
toward us; they paused, fired a 
round of gas-shells over the heads 
of the mob outside, and retreated 
again. 

Then the mob was on them, in 
a burst of screaming fury. Hidden 
gas guns appeared, and clubs, and 
curious things that looked like 
slingshots. The crowd broke for 
the entrance. The line of expe- 
diters wavered but held. There 
was a tangle of hand-to-hand 
fights, each one a vicious struggle. 
But the expediters were profes- 
sionals; outnumbered forty to one, 
they savagely chopped down their 
attackers with their hands, their 
feet and the stocks of their guns. 
The crowd hesitated. No shot had 
yet been fired, except toward the 
sky.

The air whined and shook. 
From low on the horizon, a 
needle-nosed jet thundered in. A 
plane! Aircraft never flew in the 
restricted area over the Com- 
pany’s major installations. Air- 
craft didn’t barrel in at treetop 
height, fast and low, without a 
hint of the recognition numbers 
every aircraft had to carry. 

From its belly sluiced a silvery 
milt of explosives as it came in 
over the heads of the mob, peeled 
off and up and away, then circled 
out toward the sea for another 
approach. A hail of tiny blasts 
rattled in the clear space between 
the line of expediters and the 
entrance. The big doors shook 
and cracked. 

T HE expediters stared white- 
faced at the ship. And the 
crowd began firing. An illegal 
hard-pellet gun peppered the 
glass of the doors with pock- 
marks. The guarding line of ex- 
pediters was simply overrun. 

Inside the waiting room, where 
I stood frozen, hell broke out. The 
detachment of expediters, super- 
vising the hundreds inside leaped 
for the doors to fight back the 
surging mob. But the mob inside 
the doors, the long orderly lines 
before the interviewing clerks, 
now split into a hundred scream- 
ing, milling centers of panic. 
Some rushed toward the doors; 
some broke for the halls of the 

116 



vaults themselves. I couldn’t see 
what was going on outside any 
more. I was swamped in a rush 
of women panicked out of their 
senses. 

Panic was like a plague. I saw 
doctors and orderlies struggling 
against the tide, a few scattered 
expediters battling to turn back 
the terrified rush. But I was swept 
along ahead of them all, barely 
able to keep my feet. An expe- 
diter fell a yard from me. I caught 
up his gun and began striking out. 
For this was what Lawton had 
feared — the mob loose in the 
vaults! 




I raced down a side corridor, 
around a corner, to the banked 
elevators that led to the deeps of 
the clinic. There was fighting 
there, but the elevator doors were 
closed. Someone had had the wit 
to lock them against the mob. 
But there were stairs; I saw an 
emergency door only a few yards 
away. I hesitated only long 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



enough to convince myself, 
through the fear, that my duty 
was to the Company and to the 
protection of its helpless wards 
below. I bolted through the door 
and slammed it behind me, spun 
the levers over and locked it. In 
a moment, I was running down a 
long ramp toward the cool im- 
mensities of the vaults. 

If Lawton had not mentioned 
the possible consequences of vio- 
lence to the suspendees, I sup- 
pose I would have worried only 
about my own skin. But here I 
was. I stared around, trying to get 
my bearings. I was in a sort of 



plexus of hallways, an open area 
with doors on all sides leading off 
to the vaults. I was alone; the 
noise from above and outside was 
cut off completely. 

No, I was not alone! I heard 
running footsteps, light and quick, 
from another ramp. I turned in 
time to see a figure speed down 
it, pause only a second at its base, 
and disappear into one of the 
vaults. It was a woman, but not 
a woman in nurse’s uniform. Her 
back had been to me, yet I could 
see that one hand held a gas gun, 
the other something glittering 
and small. 




PREFERRED RISK 



117 




I followed, not quite believing 
what I had seen. For I had 
caught only a glimpse of her face, 
far off and from a bad angle — 
but I was as sure as ever I could 
be that it was Rena dell’Angelai 

CHE didn’t look back. She was 
^ hurrying against time, hurry- 
ing toward a destination that ob- 
sessed her thoughts. I followed 
quietly enough, but I think I 
might have thundered like an 
elephant herd and still been un- 
heard. 

We passed a strange double- 
walled door with a warning of 
some sort lettered on it in red; 
then she swung into a side corri- 
dor where the passage was just 
wide enough for one. On either 
side were empty tiers of shelves 
waiting for suspendees. I speeded 
up to reach the corner before she 
could disappear. 

But she wasn’t hurrying now. 
She had come to a bay of shelves 
where a hundred or so bodies lay 
wrapped in their plastic sacks, 
each to his own shelf. Dropping 
to her knees, she began checking 
the tags on the cocoons at the 
lowest level. 

She whispered something sharp 
and imploring. Then, straighten- 
ing abruptly, she dropped the gas 
gun and took up the glittering 
thing in her other hand. Now I 
could see that it was a hypo- 
dermic kit in a crystal case. From 

118 



it she took a little flask of pur- 
plish liquid and, fingers shaking, 
shoved the needle of the hypo- 
dermic into the plastic stopper of 
the vial. 

Moving closer, I said: “It won’t 
work, Rena.” 

She jumped and swung to face 
me, holding the hypodermic like 
a stiletto. Seeing my face, she 
gasped and wavered. 

I stepped by her and looked 
down at the tag on the cocooned 
figure. Benedetto dell’ Angela, Na- 
poli, it said, and then the long 
string of serial numbers that iden- 
tified him. 

It was what I had guessed. 

“It won’t work,” I repeated. “Be 
smart about this, Rena. You 
can’t revive him without killing 
him.” 

Rena half-closed her eyes. She 
whispered, “Would death be 
worse than this?” 

I hadn’t expected this sort of 
superstitious nonsense from her. 
I started to answer, but she had 
me off guard. In a flash, she raked 
the glittering needle toward my 
face and, as I stumbled back in- 
voluntarily, her other hand 
lunged for the gas gun I had 
thrust into my belt. 

Only luck saved me. Not being 
in a holster, the gun’s front sight 
caught and I had the moment I 
needed to cuff her away. She 
gasped and spun up against the 
tiers of shelves. The filled hypo- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dermic shattered against the floor, 
spilling the contents into a purple, 
gleaming pool of fluorescence. 

¥3 ENA took a deep breath and 
stood erect. There were tears 
in her eyes again. 

She said in a detached voice: 
“Well done, Mr. Wills.” 

“Are you crazy?” I crackled. 
“This is your father. Do you want 
to kill him? It takes a doctor to 
revive him. You’re an educated 
woman, Rena, not a witch-ridden 
peasant! You know better than 
this!” 

She laughed — a cold laugh. 
“Educated! A peasant woman 
would have kicked you to death 
and succeeded. I’m educated, all 
right! Two hundred men, a plane, 
twenty women risking themselves 
up there to get me through the 
door. All our plans — and I can’t 
remember a way to kill you in 
time. I’m too educated to hate 
you, Claims Adjuster Wills!” She 
choked on the words. Then she 
shook her head dully. “Go ahead, 
turn me in and get it over with.” 

I took a deep breath. Turn her 
in? I hadn’t thought that far 
ahead. True, that was the obvious 
thing to do; she had confessed 
that the whole riot outside' was 
a diversion to get her down in 
the vaults, and anyone who could 
summon up that sort of organized 
anti-Company violence was some- 
one who automatically became 



my natural enemy. 

But perhaps I was too educated 
and too soft as well.. There had 
been tears on her face, over her 
father’s body. I could not remem- 
ber having heard that conspira- 
tors cried. 

And I sympathized a little. I 
had known what it was like to 
weep over the body of someone 
I loved. Despite our difficulties, 
despite everything, I would have 
done anything in the world to 
bring Marianna back to life. I 
couldn’t. Rena — she believed 
— could revive her father. 

I didn’t want to turn her in. 

I shouldn’t turn her in. It was 
my duty not to turn her in, for 
hadn’t Defoe himself ordered me 
to investigate the dissident move- 
ment of which she was clearly a 
part? Wouldn’t it be easier for 
me to win her confidence, and 
trick her into revealing its secrets, 
than to have her arrested? 

The answer, in all truth, was 
No. She was not a trickable girl, 
I was sure. But it was, at least, a 
rationale, and I clung to it. 

I COUGHED and said: “Rena, 
will you make a bargain?” 

She stared drearily. “Bargain?” 
“I have a room at the Umberto. 
If I get you out of here, will you 
go to my room and wait for me 
there?” 

Her eyes narrowed sharply for 
a second. She parted her lips to

say something, but only nodded. 

“Your word, Rena? I don’t 
want to turn you in.” 

She looked helplessly at the 
purple spilled pool on the floor, 
and wistfully at the sack that held 
her father. Then she said, “My 
word on it. But you’re a fool, 
Tom!” 

“I know it!” I admitted. 

I hurried her back up the ramp, 
back toward the violence upstairs. 
If it was over, I would have to 
talk her out of the clinic, some- 
how cover up the fact that she 
had been in the vaults. If it was 
still going on, though — 

It was. 

We blended ourselves with the 
shouting, rioting knots. I dragged 
her into the main waiting room, 
saw her thrust through the doors. 
Things were quieting even then. 
And I saw two women hastening 
toward her through the fight, and 
I do not think it was a coin- 
cidence that the steam went out 
of the rioters almost at once. 

I stayed at the clinic until 
everything was peaceful again, 
though it was hours. 

I wasn’t fooling myself. I didn’t 
have a shred of real reason for 
not having her arrested. If she 
had information to give, I was 
not the type to trick it out of her 
— even if she really was waiting 
at the Umberto, which was, in it- 
self, not likely. If I had turned 
her in, Defoe would have had 

120 



the information out of her in 
moments; but not I. 

She was an enemy of the Com- 
pany. 

And I was unable to betray 
her. 

VII 

D R. LAWTON, who seemed to 
be Chief Medical Officer for 
Anzio Clinic, said grimly: “This 
wasn’t an accident. It was 
planned. The question is, why?” 
The expediters had finished 
driving the rioters out of the 
clinic itself, and gas guns were 
rapidly dispersing the few left 
outside the entrance. At least 
thirty unconscious forms were 
scattered around — and one or 
two that were worse than uncon- 
scious. 

I said, “Maybe they were hop- 
ing to loot the clinic.” It wasn’t 
a very good lie. But then, I hadn’t 
had much practice in telling lies 
to an officer of the Company. 

Lawton pursed his lips and ig- 
nored the suggestion. “Tell me 
something, Wills. What were you 
doing down below?” 

I said quickly, “Below? You 
mean a half an hour ago?” 

“That’s what I mean.” He was 
gentle, but — well, not exactly 
suspicious. Curious. 

I improvised: “I — I thought 
I saw someone running down 
there. One of the rioters. So I 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



chased after her — after him,” I 
corrected, swallowing the word 
just barely in time. 

He nodded. “Find anything?” 

It was a tough question. Had I 
been seen going in or coming out? 
If it was coming out — Rena had 
been with me. 

I took what we called a “calcu- 
lated risk” — that is, I got a firm 
grip on my courage and told a 
big fat and possibly detectable 
lie. I said, “Nobody that I could 
find. But I still think I heard 
something. The trouble is, I don’t 
know the vaults very well. I was 
afraid I’d get lost.” 

Apparently it was on the way 
in that I had been spotted, for 
Lawton said thoughtfully, “Let’s 
take a look.” 

We took a couple of battered 
expediters with us — I didn’t re- 
gard them as exactly necessary, 
but I couldn’t see how I could 
tell Lawton that. The elevators 
were working again, so we came 
out in a slightly different part of 
the vaults than I had seen be- 
fore; it was not entirely acting 
on my part when I peered 
around. 

Lawton accepted my statement 
that I wasn’t quite sure where I 
had heard the noises, without 
argument. He accepted it all too 
easily; he sent the expediters 
scouring the corridors at random. 

And, of course, one of them 
found the pool of spilled fluores- 



cence from the hypodermic 
needle I had knocked out of 
Rena’s hand. 

W E STOOD there peering at 
the smear of purplish color, 
the shattered hypodermic, Rena’s 
gas gun. 

Lawton mused, “Looks like 
someone’s trying to wake up 
some of our sleepers. That’s our 
standard antilytic, if I’m not mis- 
taken.” He scanned the shelves. 
“Nobody missing around here. 
Take a look in the next few sec- 
tions of the tiers.” 

The expediters saluted and 
left. 

“They won’t find anyone miss- 
ing,” Lawton predicted. “And 
that means we have to take a 
physical inventory of the whole 
damn clinic. Over eighty thou- 
sand suspendees to check.” He 
made a disgusted noise. 

I said, “Maybe they were 
scared off before they finished.” 
“Maybe. Maybe not. We’ll 
have to check, that’s all.” 

“Are you sure that stuff is to 
revive the suspendees?” I per- 
sisted. “Couldn’t it just have been 
someone wandering down here 
by mistake during the commo- 
tion and — ” 

“And carrying a hypodermic 
needle by mistake, and armed 
with a gas gun by mistake. Sure, 
Wills.” 

The expediters returned and

Lawton looked at them sourly. 

They shook their heads. He 
shrugged. “Tell you what, Wills,” 
he said. “Let’s go back to the 
office and — ” 

He stopped, peering down the 
corridor. The last of our expe- 
diters was coming toward us — 
not alone. 

“Well, what do you know!” 
said Lawton. “Wills, it looks like 
he’s got your fugitive!” 

The expediter was dragging a 
small writhing figure behind him; 
we could hear whines and plead- 
ing. For a heart-stopping second, 
I thought it was Rena, against 
all logic. 

But it wasn’t. It was a quavery 
ancient, a bleary-eyed wreck of 
a man, long past retirement age, 
shabbily dressed and obviously 
the sort who cut his pension poli- 
cies to the barest minimum — 
and then whined when his old 
age was poverty-stricken. 

Lawton asked me: “This the 
man?” 

“I — I couldn’t recognize him,” 
I said. 

T AWTON turned to the weep- 
-^ing old man. “Who were you 
after?” he demanded. All he got 
was sobbing pleas to let him go; 
all he was likely to get was more 
of the same. The man was in 
pure panic. 

We got him up to one of the 
receiving offices on the upper 

122 



level, half carried by the expe- 
diters. Lawton questioned him 
mercilessly for half an hour be- 
fore giving up. The man was by 
then incapable of speech. 

He had said, as nearly as we 
could figure it out, only that he 
was sorry he had gone into the 
forbidden place, he didn’t mean 
to go into the forbidden place, he 
had been sleeping in the shadow 
of the forbidden place when fight- 
ing began and he fled inside. 

It was perfectly apparent to 
me that he was telling the truth 
— and, more, that any diversion- 
ary riot designed to get him in- 
side with a hypodermic and gas 
gun would have been planned by 
maniacs, for I doubted he could 
have found the trigger of the gun. 
But Lawton seemed to think he 
was lying. 

It was growing late. Lawton 
offered to drive me to my hotel, 
leaving the man in the custody 
of the expediters. On the way, 
out of curiosity, I asked: “Sup- 
pose he had succeeded? Can you 
revive a suspendee as easily as 
that, just by sticking a needle in 
his arm?” 

Lawton grunted. “Pretty near, 
that and artificial respiration. One 
case in a hundred might need 
something else — heart massage 
or an incubator, for instance. But 
most of the time an antilytic shot 
is enough.” 

Then Rena had not been as 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mad as I thought. 

I said: “And do you think that 
old man could have accomplished 
anything?” 

Lawton looked at me curiously. 
“Maybe.” 

“Who do you suppose he was 
after?” 

Lawton said off-handedly. “He 
was right near Bay 100, wasn’t 
he?,” 

“Bay 100?” Something struck 
a chord; I remembered following 
Rena down the corridor, passing 
a door that was odd in some way. 
Was the number 100 on that 
door? “Is that the one that’s 
locked off, with the sign on it 
that says anybody who goes in 
is asking for trouble?” 

“That’s the one. Though,” he 
added, “nobody is going to get in. 
That door is triple-plate armor; 
the lock opens only to the per- 
sonal fingerprint pattern of Defoe 
and two or three others.” 

“What’s inside it that’s so im- 
portant?” 

He said coldly, “How would I 
know? I can’t open the door.” 
And that was the end of the con- 
versation. I knew he was lying. 

1 HAD changed my bet with 
myself on the way. I won it. 
Rena was in the room waiting 
for me. She was sound asleep, 
stretched out on the bed. She 
looked as sober-faced and intent 
in her sleep as a little girl — a 



look I had noticed in Marianna’s 
sleeping face once. 

It was astonishing how little I 
thought about Marianna any 
more. 

I considered very carefully be- 
fore I rang for a bellboy, but it 
seemed wisest to let her sleep and 
take my chances with the house 
detective, if any. There was none, 
it turned out. In fact, the bellboy 
hardly noticed her — whether 
out of indifference or because he 
was well aware that I had signed 
for the room with an official 
travel-credit card of the Com- 
pany, it didn’t much matter. He 
succeeded in conveying, without 
saying a word, that the Blue Sky 
was the limit. 

I ordered dinner, waving away 
the menu and telling him to let 
the chef decide. The chef decided 
well. Among other things, there 
was a bottle of champagne in a 
bucket of ice. 

Rena woke up slowly at first, 
and then popped to a sitting posi- 
tion, eyes wide. I said quickly, 
“Everything’s all right. No one 
saw you at the clinic.” 

She blinked once. In a soft 
voice, she said, “Thank you.” She 
sighed a very small sigh and 
slipped off the bed. 

I realized as Rena was wash- 
ing up, comparisons were always 
odious, but — Well, if a strange 
man had found Marianna with 
her dress hitched halfway up her 



PREFERRED RISK 



123 



thigh, asleep on his bed, he’d have 
been in for something. What the 
“something” would be might de- 
pend on circumstances; it might 
be a raging order to knock be- 
fore he came in, it might only be 
a storm of blushes and a couple 
of hours of meticulously prissy 
behavior. But she wouldn’t just 
let it slide. And Rena, by simply 
disregarding it, was as modest as 
any girl could be. 

After all, I told myself, warm- 
ing to the subject, it wasn’t as if 
I were some excitable adolescent. 
I could see a lovely girl’s legs 
without getting all stirred up. For 
that matter, I hardly even no- 
ticed them, come to think of it. 
And if I did notice them, it was 
certainly nothing of any import- 
ance; I had dismissed it casually, 
practically forgotten it, in fact. 

She came back and said cheer- 
fully, “I’m hungry!” And so, I 
realized, was I. 

We started to eat without 
much discussion, except for the 
necessary talk of the table. I felt 
very much at ease sitting across 
from her, in spite of the fact that 
she had placed herself in opposi- 
tion to the Company. I felt re- 
laxed and comfortable; nothing 
bothered me. Certainly, I went on 
in my mind, I was as free and 
easy with her as with any man; 
it didn’t matter that she was an 
attractive girl at all. I wasn’t 
thinking of her in that way, only 

124 



as someone who needed some 
help. 

I came to. She was looking at 
me with friendly curiosity. She 
said, “Is that an American idiom, 
Tom, when you said, ‘Please pass 
the legs’?” 

W E DIDN’T open the cham- 
pagne: it didn’t seem quite 
appropriate. We had not dis- 
cussed anything of importance 
while we were eating, except that 
I had told her about the old man; 
she evidently knew nothing about 
him. She was concerned, but I 
assured her he was safe with the 
Company — what did she think 
they were, barbarians? She didn’t 
answer. 

But after dinner, with our cof- 
fee, I said: “Now let’s get down 
to business. What were you doing 
in the clinic?” 

“I was trying to rescue my 
father,” she said. 

“Rescue, Rena? Rescue from 
what?” 

“Tom, please. You believe in 
the Company, do you not?” 

“Of course!” 

“And I do not. We shall never 
agree. I am grateful to you for 
not turning me in, and I think 
perhaps I know what it cost you 
to do it. But that is all, Tom.” 
“But the Company — ” 

“When you speak of the Com- 
pany, what is it you see? Some- 
thing shining and wonderful? It 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



is not that way with me; what I 
see is — rows of my friends, 
frozen in the vaults or the expe- 
diters and that poor old man you 
caught.” 

There was no reasoning with 
her. She had fixed in her mind 
that all the suspendees were the 
victims of some sinister brutality. 
Of course, it wasn’t like that at 
all. 

Suspension wasn’t death; 
everyone knew that. In fact, it 
was the antithesis of death. It 
saved lives by taking the maimed 
and sick and putting them merci- 
fully to sleep, until they could be 
repaired. 

True, their bodies grew cold, 
the lungs stopped pumping, the 
heart stopped throbbing; true, no 
doctor could tell, on sight, 
whether a suspendee was “alive” 
or “dead.” The life processes were 
not entirely halted, but they were 
slowed enormously — enough so 
that chemical diffusion in the 
jellylike blood carried all the 
oxygen the body needed. But 
there was a difference: The dead 
were dead, whereas the sus- 
pendees could be brought back 
to life at any moment the Com- 
pany chose. 

But I couldn’t make her see 
that. I couldn’t even console her 
by reminding her that the old 
man was a mere Class E. For 
so was she. 

I urged reasonably: “Rena, you 



think something is going on under 
the surface. Tell me about it. 
Why do you think your father 
was put in suspension?” 

“To keep him out of the way. 
Because the Company is afraid 
of him.” 

I played a trump card: “Sup- 
pose I told you the real reason 
he’s in the vaults.” 

S HE was hit by that, I could 
tell. She was staring at me 
with wonder in her eyes. 

“You don’t have to speculate 
about it, Rena. I looked up his 
record, you see.” 

“You — you — ” 

I nodded. “It’s right there in 
black and white. They’re trying 
to save his life. He has radiation 
poisoning. He was a war casualty. 
It’s standard medical practice in 
cases like his to put them in sus- 
pension for a while, until the 
level of radioactivity dies down 
and they can safely be revived. 
Now what do you say?” 

She merely stared at me. 

I pressed on persuasively: 
“Rena, I don’t mean to call your 
beliefs superstitions or anything 
like that. Please understand me. 
You have your own cultural heri- 
tage and — well, I know that it 
looks as though he is some kind 
of ‘undead,’ or however you put 
it, in your folk stories. I know 
there are legends of vampires and 
zombies and so on, but — ” 



PREFERRED RISK 



125 



She was actually laughing. 
“You’re thinking of Central 
Europe, Tom, not Naples. And 
anyway — ” she was laughing 
only with her eyes now — “I do 
not believe that the legends say 
that vampires are produced by 
intravenous injections of chlor- 
promazine and pethidine in a 
lytic solution — which is, I be- 
lieve, the current technique at the 
clinics.” 

I flared peevishly: “Damn it, 
don’t you want him saved?” 

The laughter was gone. She 
gently touched my hand. “I’m 
sorry. I don’t mean to be a shrew 
and that remark wasn’t kind. 
Must we discuss it?” 

“Yes!” 

“Very well.” She faced me, chin 
out and fierce. “My father does 
not have radiation poisoning, 
Tom.” 

“He does.” 

“He does not! He is a prisoner, 
not a patient. He loved Naples. 
That’s why he was put to sleep 

— for fifty years, or a hundred, 
until everything he knew and 
loved grows away from him and 
nobody cares what he has to say 
any more. They won’t kill him 

— they don’t have to! They just 
want him out of the way, because 
he sees the Company for what it 
is.” 

“And what is that?” 

“Tyranny, Tom,” she said 
quietly. 

126 



1 BURST out, “Rena, that’s silly! 

The Company is the hope of 
the world. If you talk like that, 
you’ll be in trouble. That’s dan- 
gerous thinking, young lady. It 
attacks the foundations of our 
whole society!” 

“Good! I was hoping it would!” 
We were shouting at each other 
like children. I took time to re- 
member one of the priceless rules 
out of the Adjusters’ Handbook: 
Never lose your temper; think 
before you speak. We glared at 
each other in furious silence for 
a moment before I forced myself 
to simmer down. 

Only then did I remember that 
I needed to know something she 
might be able to tell me. Organi- 
zation, Defoe had said — an 
organization that opposed the 
Company, that was behind Ham- 
mond’s death and the riot at the 
clinic and more, much more. 

“Rena, why did your friends 
kill Hammond?” 

Her poise was shaken. “Who?” 
she asked. 

“Hammond. In Caserta. By a 
gang of anti-Company hoodlums.” 
Her eyes flashed, but she only 
said: “I know nothing of any 
killings.” 

“Yet you admit you belong to 
a subversive group?” 

“I admit nothing,” she said 
shortly. 

“But you do. I know you do. 
You said as much to me, when 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you were prevented from reviv- 
ing your father.” 

She shrugged. 

I went on: “Why did you call 
me at the office, Rena? Was it to 
get me to help you work against 
the Company?” 

She looked at me for a long 
moment. Then she said: “It was. 
And would you like to know why 
I picked you?” 

“Well, I suppose — ” 

“Don’t suppose, Tom.” Her nos- 
trils were white. She said coldly: 
“You seemed like a very good 
bet, as far as we could tell. I will 
tell you something you don’t 
know. There is a memorandum 
regarding you in the office of the 
Chief of Expediters in Naples. I 
do not choose to tell you how I 
know of it, but even your Mr. 
Gogarty doesn’t know it exists. 
It is private and secret, and it 
says of you, ‘Loyalty doubtful. 
Believed in contact with under- 
ground movement. Keep under 
close but secret surveillance’.” 

I '' HAT one rocked me, I admit. 

- “But that’s all wrong!” I fin- 
ally burst out. “I admit I went 
through a bad time after Mari- 
anna died, but — ” 

She was smiling, though still 
angry. “Are you apologizing to 
me?” 

“No, but — ” I stopped. That 
was a matter to be taken up 
with Defoe, I told myself, and I 



was beginning to feel a little 
angry, too. 

“All right,” I said. “There’s 
been a mistake; I’ll see that it’s 
straightened out. But even if it 
was true, did you think I was 
the kind of man to join a bunch 
of murderers?” 

“We are not murderers!” 
“Hammond’s body says differ- 
ent.” 

“We had nothing to do with 
that, Tom!” 

“Your friend Slovetski did.” It 
was a shot in the dark. It missed 
by a mile. 

She said loftily: “If he is such 
a killer, how did you escape? 
When I had my interview with 
you, and it became apparent that 
the expediters were less than ac- 
curate, the information came a 
little late. You could easily have 
given us trouble — Slovetski was 
in the next room. Why didn’t he 
shoot you dead?” 

“Maybe he didn’t want to be 
bothered with my body.” 

“And maybe you are all wrong 
about us!” 

“No! If you’re against the Com- 
pany, I can’t be wrong. The Com- 
pany is the greatest blessing the 
world has ever known — it’s 
made the world a paradise!” 

“It has?” She made a snorting 
sound. “How?” 

“By bringing countless bless- 
ings to all of us. Countless!” 

She was shaking with the effort 



PREFERRED RISK 



127 



of controlling her temper. “Name 
one!” 

I swore in exasperation. “All 
right,” I said. “It ended war.” 

She nodded — not a nod of 
agreement, but because she had 
expected that answer. “Right out 
of the textbooks and propaganda 
pieces, Tom. Tell me, why is my 
father in the vaults?” 

“Because he has radiation poi- 
soning!” 

“And how did he get this radia- 
tion poisoning?” 

“How?” I blinked at her. “You 
know how, Rena. In the war be- 
tween Naples and — the war — ” 

"O ENA said remorselessly, 
AY “That’s right, Tom, the war. 
The war that couldn’t have exist- 
ed, because the Company ended 
war — everybody knows that. 
Ah, Tom! For God, tell me, why 
is the world blind? Everyone be- 
lieves, no one questions. The 
Company ended war — it says 
so itself. And the blind world 
never sees the little wars that 
rage, all the time, one upon the 
heels of another. The Company 
has ended disease. But how many 
deaths are there? The Company 
has abolished poverty. But am I 
living in riches, Tom? Was the 
old man who ran into the vaults?” 
I stammered, “But — but, 
Rena, the statistical charts show 
very clearly — ” 

“No, Tom,” she said, gentle 



again. “The statistical charts show 
less war, not no war. They show 
less disease.” 

She rubbed her eyes wearily 
— and even then I thought: 
Marianna wouldn’t have dared; 
it would have smeared her mas- 
cara. 

“The trouble with you, Tom, 
is that you’re an American. You 
don’t know how it is in the world, 
only in America. You don’t know 
what it was like after the Short 
War, when America won and the 
flying squads of Senators came 
over and the governments that 
were left agreed to defederate. 
You’re used to a big and united 
country, not little city-states. You 
don’t have thousands of years of 
intrigue and tyranny and plot be- 
hind you, so you close your eyes 
and plunge ahead, and if the 
charts show things are getting a 
little better, you think they are 
perfect.” 

She shook her head. “But not 
us, Tom. We can’t afford that. We 
walk with eyes that dart about, 
seeking danger. Sometimes we see 
ghosts, but sometimes we see real 
menace. You look at the charts 
and you see that there are fewer 
wars than before. We — we look 
at the charts and we see our fath- 
ers and brothers dead in a little 
war that hardly makes a ripple 
on the graph. You don’t even see 
them, Tom. You don’t even see 
the disease cases that don’t get 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cured — because the techniques 
are ‘still experimental,’ they say. 
You don’t — Tom! What is it?” 

I suppose I showed the pain of 
remembrance. I said with an ef- 
fort, “Sorry, Rena. You made me 
think of something. Please go on.” 
“That’s all of it, Tom. You in 
America can’t be blamed. The 
big lie — the lie so preposterous 
that it cannot be questioned, the 
thing that proves itself because 
it is so unbelievable that no one 
would say it if it weren’t true — 
is not an American invention. It 
is European, Tom. You aren’t 
inoculated against it. We are.” 

1 TOOK a deep breath. “What 
about your father, Rena? Do 
you really think the Company is 
out to get him?” 

She looked at me searchingly, 
then looked hopelessly away. 
“Not as you mean it, Tom,” she 
said at last. “No, I am no para- 
noid. I think he is — incon- 
venient. I think the Company 
finds him less trouble in the deep- 
freeze than he would be walking 
around.” 

“But don’t you agree that he 
needs treatment?” 

“For what? For the radiation 
poisoning that he got from the 
atomic explosion he was nowhere 
near, Tom? Remember, he is my 
father! I was with him in the war 
— and he never stirred a kilo- 
meter from our home. You’ve 



been there, the big house where 
my aunt Luisa now lives. Did 
you see bomb craters there?” 
“That’s a lie!” I had to confess 
it to myself: Rena was beginning 
to mean something to me. But 
there were emotional buttons that 
even she couldn’t push. If she 
had been a man, any man, I 
would have had my fist in her 
face before she had said that 
much; treason against the Com- 
pany was more than I could take. 
“You can’t convince me that the 
Company deliberately falsifies 
records. Don’t forget, Rena, I’m 
an executive of the Company! 
Nothing like that could go on!” 
Her eyes flared, but her lips 
were rebelliously silent. 

I said furiously: “I’ll hear no 
more of that. Theoretical discus- 
sions are all right; I’m as broad- 
minded as the next man. But 
when you accuse the Company 
of outright fraud, you — well, 
you’re mistaken.” 

We glowered at each other for 
a long moment. My eyes fell first. 

I said sourly, “I’m sorry if I 
called you a liar. I — I didn’t 
mean to be offensive.” 

“Nor I, Tom.” she hesitated. 
“Will you remember that I asked 
you not to make me discuss it?” 
She stood up. “Thank you very 
much for a dinner. And for listen- 
ing. And most of all, for giving 
me another chance to rescue my 
father.”

I looked at my watch auto- 
matically — and incredulously. 
“It’s late, Rena. Have you a place 
to stay?” 

She shrugged. “N — yes, of 
course, Tom. Don’t worry about 
me; I’ll be all right.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“Very sure.” 

H ER manner was completely 
confident — so much so that 
I knew it for an act. 

I said: “Please, Rena, you’ve 
been through a tough time and I 
don’t want you wandering around. 
You can’t get back to Naples to- 
night.” 

“I know.” 

“Well?” 

“Well what, Tom?” she said. 
“I won’t lie to you — I haven’t 
a place to go to here. I would 
have had, this afternoon, if I had 
succeeded. But by now, every- 
thing has changed. They — that 
is, my friends will assume that I 
have been captured by the Com- 
pany. They won’t be where I 
could find them, Tom. Say they 
are silly if you wish. But they 
will fear that the Company might 
— request me to give their 
names.” 

I said crisply, “Stay here, Rena. 
No — listen to me. You stay 
here. I’ll get another room.” 
“Thank you, Tom, but you 
can’t. There isn’t a room in Anzio; 
there are families of suspendees

sleeping in the grass tonight.” 

“I can sleep in the grass if I 
have to.” 

She shook her head. “Thank 
you,” she repeated. 

I stood between her and the 
door. “Then we’ll both stay here. 
I’ll sleep on the couch. You can 
have the bed.” I hesitated, then 
added, “You can trust me, Rena.” 
She looked at me gravely for 
a moment. Then she smiled. “I’m 
sure I can, Tom. I appreciate 
your offer. I accept.” 

1 AM built too long for a hotel- 
room couch, particularly a 
room in a Mediterranean coastal 
fleabag. I lay staring into the 
white Italian night; the Moon 
brightened the clouds outside the 
window, and the room was clearly 
enough illuminated to show me 
the bed and the slight, motion- 
less form in it. Rena was not a 
restless sleeper, I thought. Nor 
did she snore. 

Rena was a most self-possessed 
girl, in fact. She had overruled 
me when I tried to keep the bell- 
boy from clearing away the din- 
ner service. “Do you think no 
other Company man ever had a 
girl in his room?” she innocently 
asked. She borrowed a pair of 
the new pajamas Defoe’s thought- 
ful expediters had bought and 
put in the bureau. But I hadn’t 
expected that, while the bellboy 
was clearing away, she would be

softly singing to herself in the 
bath. 

He had seemed not even to 
hear. 

He had also leaped to conclu- 
sions — not that it was much of 
a leap, I suppose. But he had con- 
spicuously not removed the bottle 
of champagne and its silver 
bucket of melting ice. 

It felt good, being in the same 
room with Rena. 

I shifted again, hunching up 
my torso to give my legs a chance 
to stretch out. I looked anxiously 
to see if the movement had dis- 
turbed her. 

There is a story about an ani- 
mal experimenter who left a 
chimpanzee in an empty room. 
He closed the door on the ape 
and bent to look through the key- 
hole, to see what the animal 
would do. But all he saw was an 
eye — because the chimp was 
just as curious about the experi- 
menter. 

In the half-light, I saw a 
sparkle of moonlight in Rena’s 
eye; she was watching me. She 
half-giggled, a smothered sound. 

“You ought to be asleep,” I 
accused. 

“And you, Tom.” 

I obediently closed my eyes, 
but I didn’t stop seeing her. 

If only she weren’t a fanatic. 

And if she had to be a fanatic, 
why did she have to be the one 
kind that was my natural enemy, 



a member of the group of irre- 
sponsible troublemakers that De- 
foe had ordered me to “handle”? 

What, I wondered, did he mean 
by “handle”? Did it include chlor- 
promazine in a lytic solution and 
a plastic cocoon? 

I put that thought out of my 
mind; there was no chance what- 
ever that her crazy belief, that 
the Company was using suspen- 
sion as a retaliatory measure, was 
correct. But thinking of Defoe 
made me think of my work. After 
all, I told myself, Rena was more 
than a person. She was a key that 
could unlock the whole riddle. 
She had the answers — if there 
was a movement of any size, she 
would know its structure. 

I thought for a moment and 
withdrew the “if.” She had ad- 
mitted the riot of that afternoon 
was planned. It had to be a tightly 
organized group. 

And she had to have the key. 

A T LAST, I had been getting 
slightly drowsy, but suddenly 
I was wide awake. 

There were two possibilities. I 
faced the first of them shakily — 
she might be right. Everything 
within me revolted against the 
notion, but I accepted it as a theo- 
retical possibility. If so, I would, 
of course, have to revise some 
basic notions. 

On the other hand, she might 
be wrong. I was certain she was 



PREFERRED RISK 



131 




132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



wrong. But I was equally certain 
she was no raddled malcontent 
and if she was wrong, and I could 
prove it to her, she herself might 
make some revisions. 

Propped on one elbow, I peered 
at her. “Rena?” I whispered ques- 
tioningly. 

She stirred. “Yes, Tom?” 

“If you’re not asleep, can we 
take a couple more minutes to 
talk?” 

“Of course.” I sat up and 
reached for the light switch, but 
she said, “Must we have the 
lights? The Moon is very bright.” 
“Sure.” I sat on the edge of the 
couch and reached for a cigarette. 
“Can I offer you a deal, Rena?” 
“What sort of deal?” 

“A horsetrade. You think the 
Company is corrupt and your 
father is not a casualty, right?” 
“Correct, Tom.” 

“And I think the Company is 
not corrupt and your father has 
radiation poisoning. One of us 
has to be wrong, right?” 

“Correct, Tom.” 

“Let’s find out. There are ways 
of testing for radiation-sickness. 
I’ll go into the clinic in the morn- 
ing and get the answer.” 

She also lifted up on one elbow, 
peering at me, her long hair 
braided down her back. “Will 
you?” 

“Sure. And we’ll make bets on 
it, Rena. If you are wrong — if 
your father has radiation poison- 



ing — I want you to tell me 
everything there is to tell about 
the riot today and the people be- 
hind it. If I’m wrong — ” I swal- 
lowed — “if I’m wrong, I’ll get 
your father out of there for you. 
Somehow. I promise it, Rena.” 
There was absolute silence for 
a long time. Then she swung out 
of the bed and hurried over to 
me, her hands on mine. She 
looked at me and again I saw 
tears. “Will you do that, Tom?” 
she asked, hardly audible. 

“Why, sure,” I said awkwardly. 
“But you have to promise — ” 

“I promise!” 

She was staring at me, at arm’s 
length. And then something hap- 
pened. She wasn’t staring and she 
wasn’t at arm’s length. 

Kissing her was like tasting 
candied violets; and the Moon 
made her lovelier than anything 
human; and the bellboy had not 
been so presumptuous, after all, 
when he left us the champagne. 

VIII 

TAR. LAWTON was “away from 
his desk” the next morning. 
That was all to the good. I was 
not a hardened enough conspira- 
tor to seek out chances to make 
mistakes, and although I had a 
perfectly good excuse for wanting 
to go down into the vaults again, 
I wasn’t anxious to have to use it. 
The expediter-officer in charge, 



PREFERRED RISK 



133 



though, didn’t even ask for rea- 
sons. He furnished me with what 
I wanted — a map of the vaults 
and a radiation-counter — and 
turned me loose. 

Looking at the map, I was 
astonished at the size of this sub- 
terranean pyramid. Lawton had 
said we had eighty-odd thousand 
sleepers filed away and that had 
surprised me, but by the chart I 
held in my hand, there was space 
for perhaps ten times that many. 
It was beyond belief that so much 
space was really needed, I 
thought — unless there was some 
truth to Rena’s belief that the 
Company used the clinics for 
prisons. 

I applied myself to the map. 

And, naturally, I read it wrong. 
It was very simple; I merely went 
to the wrong level, that was all. 

It looked wrong as soon as I 
stepped out of the elevator. An 
elderly, officious civilian with a 
British accent barred my way. 
“You aren’t one of us, are you?” 

I said, “I doubt it.” 

“Then would you mind?” he 
asked politely, and indicated a 
spot on the side of the hall. Per- 
haps I was suggestible, but I 
obeyed his request without ques- 
tion. It was just as well, because 
a sort of procession rounded a 
bend and came down the corri- 
dor. There was a wheeled stretch- 
er, with three elderly civilians 
puttering around it, and a bored 

134 



medic following with a jar of 
something held aloft, feeding 
through a thin plastic tube into 
the arm of the man on the stretch- 
er, as well as half a dozen others 
of more nondescript types. 

The man who had stopped me 
nearly ran to meet the stretcher. 
He stared into the waxy face and 
whispered, “It’s he! Oh, absolute- 
ly, it is he!” 

I looked and the face was odd- 
ly familiar. It reminded me of my 
childhood; it had a link with 
school days and the excitement 
of turning twelve. By the way 
the four old men were carrying 
on, however, it meant more than 
that to them. It meant, if not the 
Second Coming, at least some- 
thing close to it. 

By then I had figured out that 
this was that rare event in the 
day of a clinic — a revival. I had 
never seen one. I suppose I could 
have got out of the way and gone 
about my conspiratorial business, 
and it is no credit to me as a con- 
spirator that I did not. But I was 
fascinated. 

Too fascinated to wonder why 
revivals were so rare. 

T HE medic looked at his watch 
and, with careless efficiency, 
plucked the tube out of the waxy 
man’s arm. 

“Two minutes,” he said to one 
of the civilians. “Then he’ll be as 
good as he ever was. You’ve got 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his clothes and release papers?” 
“Oh, definitely,” said the ci- 
vilian, beaming. 

“Okay. And you understand 
that the Company takes no re- 
sponsibility beyond the policy 
covering? After all, he was one 
of the first men suspended. We 
think we can give him another 
year or so — which is a year more 
than he would have had, at that 
— but he’s not what you’d call 
a Grade A risk.” 

“Certainly,” agreed the civilian. 
“Can we talk to him now?” 

“As soon as he opens his eyes.” 
The civilian bent over the man, 
who no longer looked waxy. His 
face was now a mottled gray and 
his eyelids were flickering. He 
had begun to breathe heavily and 
irregularly, and he was mumbling 
something I couldn’t understand. 
The civilian whispered in his ear 
and the revived man opened his 
eyes and looked at him. 

It was like seeing the dead 
come to life. It was exactly that, 
in fact; twenty minutes before, 
no chemical test, no stethoscope 
or probing thumb in the eye 
socket could have detected the 
faint living glow in the almost- 
dead cells. And yet — now he 
looked, he breathed, he spoke. 

“I made it,” were his first un- 
derstandable words. 

“Indeed you did!” crowed the 
civilian in charge, while all of the 
others murmured happily to each 



other. “Sir, it is my pleasure to 
welcome you back to us. You are 
in Anzio, Italy. And I am Thomas 
Welbourne, at your service.” 

The faint eyes sparkled. Dead, 
near-dead or merely decrepit, this 
was a man who wanted to enjoy 
life. Minutes out of the tomb, he 
said: “No! Not young Tommy 
Welbourne!” 

“His grandson, sir,” said the 
civilian. 

I had it just then — that face 
had watched me through a whole 
year of school. It had been in a 
frame at the front of the room, 
with half a dozen other faces. It 
had a name under it, which, try 
as I might, I couldn’t recall; but 
the face was there all the same. 
It was an easy one to keep in 
mind — strong though sunken, 
ancient but very much alive. 

He was saying, in a voice as 
confident as any youth’s, “Ah, 
Tommy, I’ve lived to see it! Tell 
me, have you been to Mars? 
What is on the other side of the 
Moon? And the Russians — what 
are the Russians up to these 
days?” 

The civilian coughed and tried 
to interrupt, but the figure on the 
stretcher went on heedlessly: “All 
those years gone — what wonders 
must we have, A tunnel under the 
Atlantic, I’ll wager! And ships 
that fly a hundred times the speed 
of sound. Tell me, Tommy Wel- 



PREFERRED RISK 



135 



bourne! Don’t keep an old man 
waiting!” 

T HE civilian said reluctantly, 
but patiently, “Perhaps it will 
take a little explaining, sir. You 
see, there have been changes — ” 
“I know it, boy! That’s what 
I’m asking you!” 

“Well, not that sort of changes, 
sir. We’ve learned new virtues 
since your time — patience and 
stability, things of that sort. You 
see — ” 

The interesting part was over 
and the glances of the others in 
the party reminded me that I 
didn’t belong here. I stole off, but 
not before the man on the stretch- 
er noticed me and made a sort of 
clumsy two-fingered salute of 
hail and farewell as I left. It was 
exactly like the gesture in his 
picture on that schoolroom wall, 
up next to the presidents and the 
greatest of kings. 

I found a staircase and climbed 
to another level of the boxlike 
clinic. 

The local peasants called the 
vaults “coolers” or “ice cubes.” I 
suppose the reason had something 
to do with the fact that they were 
cool and rectangular, on the 
whole — perhaps because, like 
icebergs, the great bulk of the 
vaults was below the surface. But 
whatever you called them, they 
were huge. And the clinic at 
Anzio was only one out of hun- 

136 



dreds scattered all over the world. 

It was all a matter of view- 
point. To me, the clinics were 
emblems of the Company’s con- 
cern for the world. In any imagin- 
able disaster — even if some fan- 
tastic plague struck the entire 
race at once — the affected popu- 
lation could be neatly and' effec- 
tively preserved until medicine 
could catch up with their cures. 

To Rena, they were prisons 
big enough to hold the human 
race. 

It was time to find out which 
of us was right. I hurried through 
the corridors, between the tiers 
of sleepers, almost touching them 
on both sides. I saw the faint 
purplish gleam where Rena had 
spilled the fluid, and knelt beside 
the cocoon that held her father. 

The UV sterilizers overhead 
made everything look ghastly 
violet, but in any light, the waxy 
face under the plastic would have 
looked dead as death itself. I 
couldn’t blame Rena for weeping. 

I took out the little radiation 
counter and looked at it awk- 
wardly. There was nothing com- 
plicated about the device — 
fortunately, because I had had 
little experience with them. It 
was a cylinder with a flaring 
snout at one end, a calibrated 
gauge at the side, marked in 
micro-roentgens. The little needle 
flickered in the green area of the 
dial. I held it to myself and the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




reading didn’t change. I pointed 
it up and pointed it down; it 
didn’t change. 

I held it to the radiation-seared 
body of Benedetto dell’ Angela. 

And it didn’t change. 

Radiation-seared? Not unless 
the instrument lied! If dell’Angela 
had ever in his life been within 
the disaster radius of an atomic 
explosion, it had been so long be- 
fore that every trace of radio- 
active byproduct was gone! 

Rena was right! 



I WORKED like a machine, 
hardly thinking. I stood up and 
hurriedly touched the ion-tasting 
snout of the counter to the body 
on the shelf above Benedetto, the 
one above that, a dozen chosen 
at random up and down the aisle. 

Two of them sent the needle 
surging clear off the scale; three 
were as untainted by radioac- 
tivity as Benedetto himself. A 
few others gave readings from 
“mild” to “lethal” — but all in 
the danger area. 

Most were as untainted by 
radiation as Benedetto himself. 

It was possible, I told myself 
frantically, that there were mys- 
teries here I did not understand. 
Perhaps after a few months or a 
year, the radiation level would 
drop, so that the victim was still 
in deadly danger while the 



PREFERRED RISK 



137 



emitted radiation of his body was 
too slight to affect the counter. 
I didn’t see how, but it was worth 
a thought. Anything was worth a 
thought that promised another 
explanation to this than the one 
Rena had given! 

There had been, I remembered, 
a score or more of new sus- 
pendees in the main receiving 
vault at the juncture of the corri- 
dors. I hurried back to it. Here 
were fresh cases, bound to show 
on the gauge. 

I leaned over the nearest one, 
first checking to make sure its 
identification tag was the cross- 
hatched red one that marked 
“radiation.” I brought the counter 
close to the shriveled face — 

But I didn’t read the dial, not 
at first. I didn’t have to. For i 
recognized that face. I had seen 
it, contorted in terror, mumbling 
frantic pleas for mercy, weeping 
and howling, on the old Class E 
uninsurable the expediters had 
found hiding in the vaults. 

He had no radiation poisoning 
. unless a bomb had exploded 
in these very vaults in the past 
twelve hours. 

It wasn’t pleasant to stand 
there and stare around the vaults 
that were designed for the single 
purpose of saving human life — 
and to wonder how many of the 
eighty thousand souls it held 
were also prisoners. 

And it wasn’t even tolerable to 

133 



think the thought that followed. 
If the Company was corrupt, and 
I had worked to do the Com- 
pany’s business, how much of this 
guilt was mine? 

The Company, I had said and 
thought and tried to force others 
to agree, was the hope of humani- 
ty — the force that had perma- 
nently ended war (almost), 
driven out disease (nearly), de- 
stroyed the threat to any human 
of hunger or homelessness (in 
spite of the starving old man who 
slept in the shadow of the crypt, 
and others like him). 

B UT I had to face the facts 
that controverted the Big Lie. 
If war was ended, what about 
Naples and Sicily, and Prague 
and Vienna, and all the squabbles 
in the Far East? If there was no 
danger from disease, why had 
Marianna died? 

Rena had said that if there 
was no danger of disaster, no one 
would have paid their premiums. 
Obviously the Company could 
not have wanted that, but why 
had I never seen it before? Sam- 
ple wars, sample deaths — the 
Company needed them. And no 
one, least of all me, fretted about 
how the samples felt about it. 

Well, that was behind me. I’d 
made a bet with Rena, and I’d 
lost, and I had to pay off. 

I opened the cased hypodermic 
kit Rena had given me and exam- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ined it uncomfortably. I had 
never used the old-fashioned sort 
of needle hypodermic; I knew a 
little something about the high- 
pressure spray type that forced 
its contents into the skin without 
leaving a mark, but I was very 
far from sure that I could man- 
age this one without doing some- 
thing wrong. Besides, there wasn’t 
much of the fluid left, only the 
few drops left in the bottom of 
the bottle after Rena had loaded 
the needle that had been smashed. 

I hurried back along the corri- 
dor toward Benedetto dell’Angela. 
I neared again the red-labeled 
door marked Bay 100, glanced 
at it in passing — and stopped. 

This was the door that only a 
handful of people could open. It 
was labeled in five languages: 
“Entrance Strictly Prohibited. Ex- 
perimental Section.” 

Why was it standing ajar? 

And I heard a faint whisper of 
a moan: “Aiutemi, aiutemi.” 

Someone inside was calling for 
help! 

If I had been a hardened con- 
spirator, I would never have 
stopped to investigate. But, of 
course, I wasn’t. I pushed the door 
aside, against resistance, and 
peered in. 

And that was my third major 
shock in the past quarter of an 
hour, because, writhing feebly 
just inside the door, staring up at 
me with an expression of pain 



and anger, was Luigi Zorchi. 

He propped himself up on his 
hands, the rags of his plastic co- 
coon dangling from his shoulders. 

“Oho,” he said faintly. “The 
apprentice assassin again.” 

I found water for him at a 
bubble-fountain by the ramp; he 
drank at least a quart before I 
made him stop. Then he lay back, 
panting, staring at me. Except for 
the shreds of plastic and the 
bandages around the stumps of 
his legs, he was nude, like all the 
other suspendees inside their 
sacks. The luxuriant hair had al- 
ready begun to grow back. 

H E LICKED his lips. More 
vigorous now, he snarled: 
“The plan fails, does it not? You 
think you have Zorchi out of the 
way, but he will not stay there.” 

I said, “Zorchi, I’m sorry about 
all this I — I know more now 
than I did yesterday.” 

He gaped. “Yesterday? Only 
yesterday?” He shook his head. 
“I would have thought a month, 
at the least. I have been crawling, 
assassin. Crawling for days, I 
thought.” He tried to shrug — 
not easy, because he was leaning 
on his elbows. “Very well, Weels. 
You may take me back to finish 
the job now. Sticking me with a 
needle and putting me on ice will 
not work. Perhaps you should 
kill me outright.” 

“Listen, Zorchi, I said I was 



PREFERRED RISK 



139 



sorry. Let’s let it go at that for 
a moment. I — I admit you 
shouldn’t be here. The question 
is, how do you come to be 
awake?” 

“How not? I am Zorchi, Weels. 
Cut me and I heal; poison me and 
I cure myself.” He spat furiously. 
“Starve me, however, and I no 
doubt will die, and it is true that 
you have come very near to starv- 
ing me down here.” He glowered 
at the shelves of cocooned bodies 
in the locked bay. “A pity, with 
all this pork and beef on the rack, 
waiting for me, but I find I am 
not a monster, Weels. It is a 
weakness; I do not suppose it 
would stop any Company man 
for a moment.” 

“Look, Zorchi,” I begged, “take 
my word for it — I want to help 
you. You might as well believe 
me, you know. You can’t be any 
worse off than you are.” 

He stared at me sullenly for a 
moment. Then, “True enough,” he 
admitted. “What then, Weels?” 

I said hesitantly, “Well, I’d like 
to get you out of here. .” 

“Oh, yes. I would like that, too. 
How shall we do it?” 

I rubbed the back of my neck 
thoughtfully, staring at him. I 
had had a sort of half-baked, part- 
ly worked out plan for rescuing 
Benedetto. Wake him up with 
the needle; find a medical order- 
ly’s whites somewhere; dress him; 
and walk him out. 



It wasn’t the best of all possible 
plans, but I had rank enough, 
particularly with Defoe off in 
Rome, to take a few liberties or 
stop questions if it became neces- 
sary. And besides, I hadn’t really 
thought I’d have to do it. I had 
fully expected — as recently as 
half an hour ago! — that I would 
find Benedetto raddled with 
gamma rays, a certainty for death 
if revived before the half-life 
period of the radioelements in his 
body had brought the level down 
to safety. 

T HAT plan might work for 
Benedetto. But Zorchi, to 
mention only one possible obsta- 
cle, couldn’t walk. And Benedetto, 
once I took off his beard with the 
razor Rena had insisted I bring 
for that purpose, would not be 
likely to be recognized by any- 
one. 

Zorchi, on the other hand, was 
very nearly unforgettable. 

I said honestly, “I don’t know.” 
He nodded. “Nor do I, Weels. 
Take me then to your Defoe.” 
His face wrinkled in an expres- 
sion of fury and fear. “Die I can, 
if I must, but I do not wish to 
starve. It is good to be able to 
grow a leg, but do you under- 
stand that the leg must come 
from somewhere? I cannot make 
it out of air, Weels — I must eat. 
When I am in my home at 
Naples, I eat five, six, eight times 



140

a day; it is the way my body 
must have it. So if Defoe wishes 
to kill me, we will let him, but 
I must leave here now.” 

I shook my head. “Please un- 
derstand me, Zorchi — I can’t 
even do that for you. I can’t have 
anybody asking me what I was 
doing down in this level.” I hesi- 
tated only briefly; then, realizing 
that I was already in so deeply 
that secrecy no longer mattered, 
I told him about Benedetto dell’- 
Angela, and the riot that failed, 
and my promise. 

His reaction was incredulity. 
“You did not know, Weels? The 
arms and legs of the Company 
do not know what thoughts pass 
through its brain? Truly, the 
Company is a wonderful thing! 
Even the peasants know this 
much — the Company will do 
anything it must.” 

“I admit I never guessed. Now 
what?” 

“That is up to you, Weels. If 
you try to take the two of us out, 
it endangers you. It is for you to 
decide.” 

So, of course, I could decide 
only one way. 

I hid the hypodermic behind 
one of the bodies in Bay 100; it 
was no longer useful to me. I 
persuaded Zorchi to lie quietly 
in one of the tiers near Benedetto, 
slammed the heavy door to Bay 
100, and heard the locks snap. 
That was the crossing of the 



Rubicon. You could open that 
door easily enough from inside 
— that was to protect any per- 
sonnel who might be caught in 
there. But only Defoe and a 
couple of others could open it 
from without, and the hypo- 
dermic was now as far out of 
reach as the Moon. 

I opened Benedetto dell’An- 
gela’s face mask and shaved him, 
then sealed it again. I found an- 
other suspendee of about the 
same build, made sure the man 
was not radioactive, and trans- 
ferred them. I switched tags: 
Benedetto dell’Angela was now 
Elio Barletteria. Then I walked 
unsteadily to the ramp, picked 
up the intercom and ordered the 
medical officer in charge to come 
down. 

I T WAS not Dr. Lawton who 
came, fortunately, but one of 
his helpers who had seen me be- 
fore. I pointed to the pseudo- 
Barletteria. “I want this man re- 
vived.” 

He sputtered, “You — you 
can’t just take a suspendee out of 
his trance, Mr. Wills. It’s a viola- 
tion of medical ethics! These men 
are sick. They — ” 

“They’ll be sicker still if we 
don’t get some information from 
this one,” I said grimly. “Are you 
going to obey Mr. Defoe’s orders 
or not?” 

He sputtered some more, but

he gave in. His orderlies took 
Benedetto to the receiving sta- 
tion at the foot of the vault; one 
of them stood by while the doctor 
worriedly went through his rou- 
tine. I sat and smoked, watching 
the procedure. 

It was simple enough. One in- 
jection, a little chafing of the 
hands and feet by the bored 
orderly while the doctor glowered 
and I stonily refused to answer 
his questions, and a lot of wait- 
ing. And then the “casualty” 
stirred and moaned. 

All the stand-by apparatus was 
there — the oxygen tent and the 
pulmotor and the heart stimula- 
tor and so on. But none of it was 
needed. 

I said: “Fine, Doctor. Now 

send the orderly to have an ambu- 
lance standing by at the main 
entrance, and make out an exit 
pass for this casualty.” 

“No!” the doctor shouted. “This 
is against every rule, Mr. Wills. 
I insist on calling Dr. Lawton — ” 

“By all means,” I said. “But 
there isn’t much time. Make out 
the pass and get the ambulance, 
and we’ll clear it with Dr. Law- 
ton on the way out.” He was all 
ready to say no again when I 
added: “This is by direct order 
of Mr. Defoe. Are you question- 
ing his orders?” 

He wasn’t — not as long as I 
was going to clear it with Dr. 
Lawton. He did as I asked. One 

142 



of the advantages of the Com- 
pany’s rigid regulations was that 
it was hard to enforce strict se- 
curity on its personnel. If you 
didn’t tell the staff that they were 
working for something needing 
covering up, you couldn’t expect 
them to be constantly on guard. 

When the orderly was gone 
and the doctor had scrawled out 
the pass, I said cordially, “Thank 
you, Doctor. Now would you like 
to know what all the fuss was 
about?” 

“I certainly would,” he snap- 
ped. “If you think — ■” 

“I’m sorry,” I apologized. 
“Come over here and take a look 
at this man.” 

T JUGGLED the radiation coun- 
■*- ter in my hand as he stalked 
over. “Take a look at his eyes,” 
I invited. 

“Are you trying to tell me that 
this is a dangerously radioactive 
case? I warn you, Mr. Wills — ” 
“No, no,” I said. “See for your- 
self. Look at the right eye, just 
beside the nose.” 

He bent over the awakening 
body, searchingly. 

I clonked him with the radia- 
tion counter on the back of the 
head. They must have retired 
that particular counter from ser- 
vice after that; it wasn’t likely to 
be very accurate any more. 

The orderly found me bending 
over the doctor’s body and call- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing for help. He bent, too, and 
he got the same treatment. Bene- 
detto by then was awake; he lis- 
tened to me and didn’t ask ques- 
tions. The blessings of dealing 
with conspirators — it was not 
necessary to explain things more 
than once. 

And so, with a correctly uni- 
formed orderly, who happened to 
be Benedetto dell’ Angela, pushing 
the stretcher, and with myself 
displaying a properly made out 
pass to the expediter at the door, 
we rolled the sham-unconscious 
body of Luigi Zorchi out to a 
waiting ambulance. 

I felt my pulse hammering as 
we passed the expediter at the 
door. I had thrown my coat over 
the place where legs should have 
been on “Barletteria,” and Bene- 
detto’s old plastic cocoon, into 
which we had squeezed Zorchi, 
concealed most of him. 

1 NEEDN’T have worried. The 
expediter not only wasn’t sus- 
picious, he wasn’t even interested. 

Benedetto and I lifted Zorchi 
into the ambulance. Benedetto 
climbed in after him and closed 
the doors, and I went to the front. 
“You’re dismissed,” I told the 
driver. “I’ll drive.” 

As soon as we were out of sight 
of the clinic, I found a phone, got 



Rena at the hotel, told her to 
meet me under the marquee. In 
five minutes, she was beside me 
and we were heading for the 
roads to the north. 

“You win,” I told her. “Your 
father’s in back — along with 
somebody else. Now what? Do 
we just try to get lost in the hills 
somewhere?” 

“No, Tom,” she said breathless- 
ly. “I — I have made arrange- 
ments.” She giggled. “I walked 
around the square and around, 
until someone came up to me. 
You do not know how many gen- 
tlemen came before that! But 
then one of my — friends showed 
up, to see if I was all right, and 
I arranged it. We go up the Rome 
highway two miles and there will 
be a truck.” 

“Fine,” I said, stepping on the 
gas. “Now do you want to climb 
back and tell your father — ” 

I stopped in the middle of the 
word. Rena peered at me. “Tom,” 
she asked anxiously, “is some- 
thing wrong?” 

I swallowed, staring after a dis- 
appearing limousine in the rear- 
view mirror. “I — — hope not,” I 
said. “But your friends had better 
be there, because we don’t have 
much time. I saw Defoe in the 
back of that limousine.”
