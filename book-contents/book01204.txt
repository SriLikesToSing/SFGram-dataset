EXILES TO GLORY, J.E. Pournelle 4 

Grow or die! This implacable law of nature 
Is as true for social organisms as it is for 
biological ones. Could it be that those who 
tell us “think small," “use less,” “do 
without," — “don't grow” — are the instru- 
ments of the death-wish element of the 
human psyche?

All he wanted was a 
quiet life; Achilles’ 
choice was not for Kevin 
Senecal — but it was not 
for him to choose .... 



For Dan Alderson, the sane 
genius . 

First he heard the click of the 
switchblade. Then the whining, feral 
voice. “Hey man, gimme money!” 
There were four of them in his 
path: two slouching against the wall, 
two erect and staring. Westwood 
was deserted. The UCLA campus 
beyond showed lights, but it might 
have been in another city for all the 
good it did him. Kevin tasted sour 
bile, felt the sharp knot of fear in 
his stomach. They moved closer. 

“Come on, hand it over, you 
sumbich.” The spokesman’s blade 
moved in intricate, blurringly fast 
l>asses inches from Kevin’s face. It 
gleamed dully despite the power- 
saving partial blackout in the city. 
Ihc blade’s wielder laughed as 
Kevin cringed away. 

Kevin was a well-muscled six- 
looter, had played football for 
UCLA and made his letter in his 
|unior year before the pressure of 
Studies made him drop from the 



team; he was certain he was more 
than a match for any of them — for 
any two — but the knife seemed hun- 
gry for his eyes, and he felt only 
fear and shame. His legs wouldn’t 
move. He reached into his pocket 
and took out his wallet. 

“Watch,” the mugger said. 
“Take it off.” The whining voice 
was filled with contempt and sadis- 
tic power-lust. Kevin felt it wash 
over him, and felt contempt for 
himself. “Turn out all your pockets. 
Deucey, rub him over." 

Another of the young gang- 
sters — they couldn’t, Kevin thought, 
be more than sixteen — came 
up behind him and rubbed his hands 
over Kevin’s clothes. The hands 
moved insultingly, paused in insult- 
ing places, then reached into his 
pockets and took out his lighter. 
“Aw, he's got cigarettes,” Deucey 
said. 

“Good for you, mother,” the 
spokesman said. “We cut you if 
you don’t have cigarettes. Cut you 
good. Now we miss the fun. Get in 
there.” The knife jerked to indicate 
a dark alleyway. 

Kevin was beyond terror. He had 
never experienced the feeling be- 
fore, but he recognized it now, like 
something known previously from a 
faded photograph. They pushed him 
off the street and away from his last 
hope of rescue. The street lights 
dimmed even more just as they en- 
tered the alley; it was almost pitch 
black in the stinking passageway 
between buildings. His foot kicked 



EXILES TO GLORY

something, trash or a dead cat, and 
insanely he thought of the city gar- 
bage strike — would anyone find him 
for weeks? He was certain the 
gangsters were going to kill him, 
and kept worrying about that: would 
the strike end in time for them to 
find his body? 

Suddenly he was surrounded by 
the smell of naptha, strong enough 
to overpower the smells of urine and 
decay in the alley. He felt a chill on 
scalp and shoulders. Lighter fluid. 
They were going to bum him alive! 

Desperation drove him forward, 
away from his captors for a mo- 
ment. The knife had terrified him, 
but the threat of becoming a living 
torch did something else. He was no 
less afraid — more so if that were 
possible — but now there was rage 
and hatred as well. He cast about 
for a weapon, anything to defend 
himself. He was certain he was go- 
ing to die, but now he wanted to 
take them with him, to end this 
humiliation and show them he was a 
man — 

His hand struck a garbage can. It 
had a lid, and he seized that by the 
handle. Years before, when he was 
only seventeen — it was only five 
years ago, but at this moment it felt 
like two lifetimes — he had partici- 
pated in a tournament held by the 
Society for Creative Anachronism. 
The SCA fighters used wooden 
swords, but their armor and other 
equipment had been real. He’d been 
fascinated by the use of shields as 
weapons. A hand grabbed his hair, 



and despair gave him strength of a 
different order than when he’d 
fought in the SCA tournament. 

He swung the lid blindly, felt it 
clash, then swung it backhand 
against the spokesman’s face. He 
felt bone crunch, and shouted his 
triumph. 

As the first gangster screamed 
Kevin used the shield to deflect 
another half-seen knife attack, then 
again blindly swung the lid back- 
hand with all his strength. He 
couldn’t see anything, but he could 
feel when he connected, and he 
wanted to hurt them. He hated them 
with all his soul, and he wanted 
them to feel as humiliated as he had 
felt. He struck out again and again, 
felt the improvised shield strike 
home at least once more. Then he 
was past them and in the street. 

The sight of freedom ahead rob- 
bed him of his rage; he turned and 
ran. Two of them followed him for 
a block, but they didn’t have the 
wind to keep up. 

He ran on and on, long after he 
could no longer hear their heel-beats 
behind him. 

★ ★ ★ 

The Los Angeles policeman 
showing his badge at Kevin’s door 
was big and burly, and looked as if 
he ought to be in uniform instead of 
neat civilian tunic and trousers. Ke- 
vin’s landlady stood disapprovingly 
behind him in the hall. 

“Detective Sergeant Mason,’’ the 



6 



GALAXY 




policeman said. “May I come in?” 

Kevin couldn’t think of anything 
he had done. He was exhausted 
from standing in lines for his food 
ration stamps, and he wanted to 
send the policeman away, but he 
was afraid that his landlady would 
believe he was in trouble with the 
law. Mrs. Jeffries was a good friend 
to her student tenants. She would let 
them be late with the rent, but she 
didn’t want police trouble in her 
rooming house. “What’s it about?” 
Kevin asked. His voice sounded 
much more calm than he felt. 

“This yours?” The policeman 
held up a wallet. 

“Uh— ” 

“It’s got your ID in it,” the de- 
tective said. “I'm returning it. No 
big deal. Want to talk about how 
you lost it.” 

“Yes, sure, it’s mine,” Kevin 
said. He felt relief, and saw that 
Mrs. Jeffries had lost her worried 
look. Kevin winked at her and got a 
slight smile in return before she left 
and the policeman came in. 

The room wasn’t very large. 
There was a couch that could make 
into a bed, but it was long enough 
for Kevin to sleep on without un- 
folding it, and he never opened it. 
The walls were lined with book- 
shelves. Over the years the many 
students who’d lived there had 
added to the shelving until there 
wasn’t a bare wall. There were two 
desks and a table that came from the 
Salvation Army Thrift Store. At the 
opposite end from the entrance was 



an opening onto an alcove where a 
stove, refrigerator and cat litter box 
filled what would not have been a 
very large closet. The room smelled 
of food and cats. The desks were 
littered with papers, pocket calcu- 
lator, library reader- screen, opened 
books, drafting tools, and junk 
mail. 

“Reminds me of my student 
days,” Sergeant Mason said. “1 
stayed down the street in a room 
Just like this. What class are you?” 

“Senior. I think.” 

“Kevin Senecal,” Mason said. 
“Senecal. Unusual name. Don’t 
think I ever heard it before.” 

“It’s Norman French. We think it 
used to be Seneschale,” Kevin told 
him. “That’d be Stewart in English 
— you know, meant Steward.” He 
wondered why he was so nerv- 
ous with this policeman. The cop 
had brought back his wallet, and 
Kevin hadn’t done anything to be 
afraid of. But the policeman’s man- 
ner was unusual, cagey, as if he 
were trying to think of the right way 
to say something unpleasant. He 
didn’t think the policeman would 
have come alone if he’d intended to 
make an arrest, but why was he 
acting this way? 

Kevin had never had much con- 
tact with police: in the neighborhood 
where he grew up police were to be 
avoided. Cops didn’t have much re- 
spect for people on welfare and un- 
employment. When Greg Tolland’s 
People’s Alliance won the White 
House and Congress that had 



EXILES TO GLORY 



7 




changed for a while, but then Tol- 
land was hounded by the press and 
the Alliance was smeared and things 
went back to politics as usual and — 

His reverie was interrupted by the 
policeman. “Here.” Mason tossed 
him the wallet. “Put it away. Offi- 
cially, I never saw it.” 

“Uh?” 

“Look, Kevin — you don’t mind if 
I call you Kevin? We took this off 
some bad people last night. Guy 
carrying it had a broken jaw. His 
buddies were trying to get him to a 
doctor. ’ ’ 

“You caught the bastards! Good 
work,” Kevin said. He looked at 
the policeman with new respect. His 
mother, who had once had a better 
life, had always told him the police 
were all right. “But isn’t the wallet 
evidence?” 

“You don’t want to prosecute.” 

“But—” 

“No.” The policeman was very 
firm. “Look, those guys belong to 
the Green Fence gang. If you iden- 
tify them, you won’t live until the 
trial. Actually you’re probably in 
trouble anyway; they wouldn’t have 
kept the wallet if they didn’t have 
something in mind. Usually they 
just take out the money, put the 
credit cards into an envelope and 
mail them to friends — and dump the 
wallet so there’s no evidence if we 
shake them down. They kept yours. 
I don’t have to be very smart to 
guess why. You did a good job on 
the guy with the broken jaw. And a 
better job on the other one.” 



The policeman was looking care- 
fully at Kevin’s face. Kevin didn’t 
care. He was glad that he’d hurt 
those bastards. 

Whatever the policeman saw 
seemed to please him. “You didn’t 
know, did you?" the cop asked. 
‘You killed one of them. That gar- 
bage can lid caught him just at the 
base of the skull. Clean and neat.” 
“Jeez — ” Kevin felt a rush of 
shock, fear, and anger. “I never 
meant to kill anyone! Am I in trou- 
ble for that?” 

“You would be if we knew who’d 
done it. But of course we don’t. 
Never found anything at all. They 
must have ditched the wallet.” 

It took Kevin a moment to catch 
on. “But—” 

“But nothing,” Mason said. 
“We got ourselves a new DA, a 
real People’s Alliance type, and 
we’ve got judges who don’t approve 
of ‘deadly force.’ Somebody killed 
a juvenile last night, and you don’t 
kill juvies in this town. That’s bad 
news.” 

“But they were trying to kill me! 
They poured lighter fluid on me, to 
set me on fire!” 

“Can you prove that?” 

“How the hell could I prove — ” 
“Exactly,” the policeman said. 
“You can’t. And we can’t do one 
damned thing for you, Kevin. If we 
give you protection the DA will 
want to know why, and we can’t 
tell him or he’ll have you up for 
manslaughter of a juvie. It gets 
worse. The Green Fence will be

GALAXY 




looking for you. If you’re smart 
they won’t find you.” 

“You’re telling me I ought to run 
because some muggers tried to kill 
me and I defended myself?” Ke- 
vin’s face showed anger. His fists 
clenched and he felt the blood ris- 
ing— 

“Nope.” The detective’s calm 
was maddening. “Remember, I 
don’t even know who you are. I’m 
just returning some property I found 
while I was off duty. Which, by the 
way, I am now. You got any beer 
in that ’frig?” 

“Sure.” Kevin went to the re- 
frigerator. Snowdrop, his white kit- 
ten, was sitting guard on top of it. 
She mewed hopefully when Kevin 
opened the door, then looked re- 
signed when no cat food or milk came 
out. 

Mason popped the top of the beer 
bulb and made a face at it. “I liked 
this stuff in bottles or cans. Now we 
got biodegradable cardboard, and it 
don’t taste the same.” He drank it 
anyway, a long healthy glug. “Can 
you change apartments?” 

“I’m a month behind here. 
There’s no way I could get the 
money for a new place.” 

“Probably wouldn’t help anyway. 
They’d follow you when you 
moved. What are your plans?” 
“Well, I graduate this term ...” 
“You might last that long. Want 
some advice? Keep out of dark 
places. Don’t have a routine. Come 
home at different times, and don’t 
(‘at in the same place every day. 



Keep the shades down and keep 
your shadow off the shade. Lock up 
good when you go out. Get a better 
lock. Get two locks. And stay with 
people you know.” Mason drank 
again. His lips tightened as he set 
the bulb on the couch arm. “Kevin, 
do you think I like this? I’m a cop. 
My job is protecting people. And 
I’m telling you that I can’t protect 
you, that the bastards in City Hall 
won’t let me. I don’t like that 
much, but you tell me — what should 
I do?” 

“I don’t know,” Kevin said. 

“Yeah. Well, if you think of 
something, let me know.” 

It seemed appropriate that the 
lights dimmed just then. The 
windmills weren’t getting enough 
power, and it took a while to get 
generators fired up. 

★ ★ ★ 

Long after the policeman left Ke- 
vin sat at his desk staring at a book. 
He read the same page three times, 
but none of it registered. He was 
afraid. His books said he lived in a 
post- industrial society and described 
the benefits in glowing words, but 
the police couldn’t help him. 

Out there somewhere was a gang 
of nameless children — the DA 
would call them children, and Kevin 
a child-murderer — and those chil- 
dren would kill him if they could, 
and the police were helpless. The 
United States of America in all its 
awful majesty was no use at all. 



rXILES TO GLORY

The police could give out tickets 
and harass taxpayer demonstrations 
but they couldn’t protect Kevin’s 
life. 

His life had been settled and or- 
derly, completely planned. He 
would get his degree and go to work 
for one of the big international cor- 
porations, perhaps even go out to 
one of the near-Earth space indus- 
tries if he could get a post. Junior 
engineers weren’t paid very well, 
because nearly everyone graduated 
from state universities and had some 
kind of “professional” job — or 
didn’t work at all — but when he got 
his degree Kevin would be eligible 
to join a strong union, and the union 
would keep the pay raises coming. 
Kevin looked forward to marriage, a 
house, a car, perhaps a camper and 
a small boat. 

When he told his friends they 
usually laughed and said it sounded 
dull, but Kevin didn’t mind. Dull 
was fine, as long as it was secure. 
After the years of living with his 
mother and his brother on welfare 
checks and food stamps, split pea 
soup, chicken once a week when 
they were lucky, patched clothes 
and shoes bought from the Salvation 
Arniy, dull-but-secure was attrac- 
tive. Dull meant buying food in pri- 
vate stores instead of standing in 
long lines at the cooperatives. Dull 
meant living in a neighborhood 
where the police were polite and re- 
spectful. Dull meant all the things 
Kevin had never had and always 
wanted. 



And his dream of dull security 
was vanishing with the memory of a 
garbage can lid smacking into hu- 
man bone. 

The book stared back at him. 
“The most crucial questions that 
will be faced by every post-indus- 
trial society will deal with education, 
talent, and science policy. The rapid 
expansion of a professional and 
technical class, and the increased 
dependence of the society on scien- 
tific manpower, suggest a new and 
absolutely unique dimension in so- 
cial affairs: i.e., that the economic 
growth rate of a post-industrial soci- 
ety will be less dependent on money 
capital than on ‘human capital.' 

The words blurred and the idea 
was silly to begin with. The most 
crucial question was: how would 
Kevin Senecal stay alive long 
enough to graduate and get his un- 
ion card so that he could find a job? 

★ ★ ★ 

The letter had been generated by 
a computer. It had his name spelled 
‘Senegal,’ but the student ID 
number was correct. It was for him. 

It told him that two summer clas- 
ses he’d taken at California State 
University, Northridge, were not 
recognized as transferable for credit 
to UCLA. “As these classes are 
prerequisite to other classes re- 
quired for graduation (see schedule 
4 below) you may not hold credit in 
the classes named in schedule 4, 
and thus you have not completed the 



10 



GALAXY 




requirements for graduation. Your 
application for graduation is denied, 
and your present class status is sec- 
ond-year, commonly called soph- 
omore. Upon completion of the re- 
quired prerequisites and, following 
that completion, your successful 
completion of the courses noted in 
schedule 4 (see below) you may 
again make application for gradua- 
tion.” 

He read it three times. It said the 
same thing each time. Instead of 
graduating in two months, he had 
two more years of school. He crum- 
pled the letter in rage, but then 
carefully smoothed it out. These 
things happened. It was futile to get 
excited. Computers often made 
mistakes. He telephoned the UCLA 
Appointment Exchange and regis- 
tered a request to see his advisor. 

They could give him one in two 
weeks. He raged silently at the 
phone, but there was no point in 
being angry with a computer. It 
could only understand a very limited 
vocabulary. After he hung up, he 
felt ashamed for being so angry. It 
shouldn’t be surprising that it would 
lake a while to see his advisor. 
There were over 100,000 students at 
UCLA. It took time to arrange for a 
human interview. 



II 

He took the policeman’s advice; 
varied his schedule, stayed off 
streets at night, and always locked 



his doors. His friends didn’t notice. 
He’d always been something of a 
loner and a bit of a bookworm since 
he dropped out of the football 
squad, so there was no one to miss 
him. The girl he’d been dating had 
found someone else two days before 
the muggers had caught him, and 
except for Wiley Ralston no one 
would care. 

Wiley was a student one year 
ahead of Kevin, staying on after 
graduation to specialize in space in- 
dustry technology. Engineering stu- 
dents were never popular on cam- 
pus, and those going to space were 
hated. The One Earth Society, and 
other anti-technology groups, pick- 
eted the engineering building 
nearly everyday. Their lunch-time 
demonstrations seldom got out of 
hand, and Kevin had become ac- 
customed to their shouted insults 
whenever he went in or came out of 
his classrooms. Now, though, they 
began to get on his nerves. When 
they ritually shouted “murderer!” at 
him, he remembered the crunch of 
bone that he’d felt that night in the 
alley. 

“Hey, don’t let those nuts shake 
you,” Wiley said as they walked 
past the demonstrators. 

“Aw, they don’t,” Kevin said. 
They hurried toward the cafeteria. 
There was a long line waiting. “Not 
really, anyway.” 

“You ever really listen to them?” 
Wiley asked. 

“Once,” Kevin said. “Didn’t 
make much sense to me. They kept 



EXILES TO GLORY 



11 




telling me we’re wasting all that 
money in space when there’s so 
much needed here, and I know bet- 
ter. Without space technology we’d 
be a lot worse off than we are now. 
What goes to space wouldn’t help 
anyway. It’s just not enough.” 

Wiley nodded, then waved at the 
line ahead of them. “Yeah, except 
sometimes 1 wonder.” 

“You?” 

Wiley Ralston laughed. “Not 
very often. Just sometimes. Like 
this. Why ’re so many people lined 
up for lunch? Because you get a 
free lunch on vour student ID card. 
Which is why most of these turkeys 
are students to begin with.” 

Kevin didn’t say anything. It was 
one reason he’d decided to go to 
college. The state university was 
free, and the food at the UCLA 
cafeteria was better than anything 
his mother had ever been able to 
afford on straight welfare. 

“Better to be a student and eat 
than be unemployed,” Wiley said. 
“And hell, it’s all this technology 
that keeps people unemployed. 
That’s the way they see it, any- 
way.” 

“You know better,” Kevin said. 
“What’s important is production. 
High production means a lot to go 
around, and — ” He stopped, be- 
cause Wiley was laughing at him. 

“Gotcha,” his friend said. He 
tossed back a shock of unruly red 
hair and grinned broadly. “You 
know the trouble with you, old 
buddy? You care. These jokers say 



the world’s got to learn to use low 
technology, be kind to the Earth, 
live with the land, or our 
great-grandchildren will have green 
tentacles or something — ” 

“They never — ” 

“And you really worry about 
whether they’re right or not,” Wiley 
finished. 

“But they aren’t, and I can prove 
it — ” 

“So-friggin-what ?” Wiley Ralston 
demanded. “Look, Kev, maybe 
they’re right. Look around you. 
Food lines in the US of A. Want 
in the middle of plenty. And that’s 
here! All over the world people 
are breeding like mad, nobody’s 
got enough of anything, and hell, 
maybe all this space effort will 
be the last straw, the push that 
makes the donkey lie down and die. 
So what? You say space will save 
the Earth, they say it will kill us, 
and I say — somebody’s going to get 
rich out there, and that somebody is 
going to be Wiley Ralston. I’ll get 
mine, and if they’re so stupid they’d 
rather put on demonstrations than 
get in on a good thing, that’s their 
lookout.” 

But Wiley had spoken too loudly, 
and others overheard. An alter- 
nate technology group came up to 
argue. A Zero-Growth group joined 
in, then some fanatics from the One 
Earth Society. If the various pro- 
testors hadn’t got to arguing among 
themselves the scene might have 
gotten ugly; as it was, Kevin missed 
his lunch.

Even so, he preferred to be in 
crowds. Most of the anti-technology 
students wouldn’t actually harm 
him. None wanted to kill him. Bet- 
ter them than the Green Fence.

His advisor was a prim, rather 
prissy-looking woman in her thir- 
ties. She reminded Kevin of a sen- 
tence in his sociology book. “The 
post-industrial society is organized 
around knowledge, and this gives 
rise to new social relationships and 
new structures which have to be or- 
ganized politically.’’ Ms. Rasmus- 
sen was the embodiment of that: she 
had knowledge, or was supposed to 
have, and that gave her power. 

As he faced her, Kevin thought 
that was a bunch of horse puckey. 
She had a job that gave her power, 
and she liked that a lot. 

‘‘What seems to be the trouble?’’ 
she asked. She shoved a form to- 
ward him. His student ID card em- 
bossed his name and ID number on 
the form, but he had to fill in the 
address by hand. She waited until 
he was finished before she picked 
up the computer letter Kevin had 
handed her in response to her 
(jiiestion. 

She read it through twice. “This 
seems to be in order,’’ she said. 

Kevin wanted to scream at her, 
hut he held his temper. Years of 
watching his mother manipulate the 
welfare workers had given him both 
patience and technique. “Please 



ma’am,’’ he said. He felt sick say- 
ing it, but forced himself to keep his 
tone respectful. “This costs me two 
years of my life. It isn’t fair, 
ma’am. I worked hard, and they tell 
me I’m still not through. Please, 
can’t you do something?’’ 

She punched buttons on her con- 
sole. “I’ll need your ID card,’’ she 
said. She inserted the plastic into 
the machine. Records flowed across 
the screen. She peered at it, adjust- 
ing her glasses with fussy little 
movements, smiling thinly, a 
superior smile, the smile of those 
with power. “It’s all in order,’’ she 
said, “just as the letter tells you. 
You took the courses without the 
proper prerequisites, and so of 
course you’re not entitled to credit 
for them.’’ 

“But, ma’am, I had the prere- 
quisites,’’ Kevin whined. He tried 
to keep his voice pleading, showing 
that he appreciated all that Ms. 
Rasmussen was doing for him. The 
effort made him tense. He hated 
himself, and suddenly realized that 
this was the way he’d felt when the 
muggers had him: helpless and vio- 
lated. And he felt that way a lot, 
lately. 

“You did not have prerequisites 
as recognized by this university,’’ 
Miss Rasmussen said. “I'm sorry, 
but I can’t help you.’’ She sounded 
pleased. She began marking the 
form; it would be turned in to re- 
cord that she’d had another inter- 
view. The accounting machines 
needed the completed form to justify 



EXILES TO GLORY

her job to the Regents. So many 
interviews completed, requiring so 
many person-hours, requiring an 
adjustment and increase in salaries 
and personnel for the counseling de- 
partment; in these days of un- 
employment it was necessary to 
keep one’s forms in order. 

“But,” Kevin stammered. He 
almost lost control of his voice, but 
regained it with effort, and con- 
tinued to keep a respectful tone. “I 
got A’s in those courses,” Kevin 
said. “A’s at Northridge, B’s in the 
courses here. What difference does 
it make if I had the prerequisites if 
1 got B’s here? Prerequisites are 
supposed to keep you out of work 
you can’t handle, but it’s obvious 
that I can handle the work, because 
I did. Please, ma’am, can’t you do 
something to help me?” 

She held her head high and her 
look of sympathy was patently arti- 
ficial. “We have to go by the 
rules,” Ms. Rasmussen said. “There 
was a mistake. You should never 
have been admitted to the courses 
here without proper prerequisites. 
Now, officially, you have never 
taken those courses at all. You’ll 
have to go meet the prerequisite 
requirements, then take the courses 
over again. I’m very sorry.” 
She wasn’t. 

“But that’s two years of my 
life!” Kevin said. He wasn’t def- 
erential now. “You can’t do that to 
me!” 

Patiently Ms. Rasmussen punched 
in more numbers. A blur of fine 



print filled the screen. “Look,” she 
said. “Here are the rules. You may 
read them for yourself — ” 

If I plead, Kevin thought. If I 
plead, I may, just may, get her to 
help. She wants to feel important, 
and I can help her. Just say the right 
words. 

But the feeling of self-contempt 
was too strong. His control broke 
like an exploded dam. “Damn you 
to hell!” he shouted. 

“You will not swear at me.” Ms. 
Rasmussen stood. “Get out of here. 
Instantly. I will not have students 
shouting at me. I do not have to put 
up with that. If you don’t leave I 
will call the Campus Police.” 

Police. He didn’t want trouble 
with the police. Kevin stood. “I’m 
very sorry,” he said. “I should not 
have lost my temper — ” 

“Go.” Now that she was in con- 
trol, Ms. Rasmussen felt much bet- 
ter. “Go now.” 

“Yes,” Kevin said. He turned. 
“Wait.” The counselor kept him 
standing for a long moment. Her 
smile, a thin wintry smile that 
showed the tiniest thin line of white 
teeth, played at her lips. “You for- 
got your ID card. That’s very im- 
portant, you will need it. Here.” 
She laid it on the desk, although it 
would have been easier to hand it to 
him. 

Kevin took the card and left. As 
he went out, Ms. Rasmussen was 
marking the time onto still another 
form. The form title was “Inter- 
views Successfully Completed.”

★ ★ ★ 

He walked home glumly, not 
knowing what to do. There was a 
Zero-Growth Movement rally on 
campus, and students were shouting. 
An alternate technology group 
was arguing with the Z-G’s, 
screaming that all technology wasn't 
bad, only the big industries. 
Another group of Social Technocrats 
appeared to argue for high technol- 
ogy owned by the people. The 
C'ampus Police stood by inter- 
estedly. 

He walked in fury, not knowing 
whether to be angry with himself for 
losing his temper when he might 
have talked Ms. Rasmussen into 
doing something for him, or for not 
telling her exactly what he thought 
of her and her useless bureaucratic 
job; whether to be ashamed for not 
getting the results he wanted, or for 
trying when trying meant pretending 
respect for the Rasmussens of this 
world. 

When he reached the top of the 
stairs he wasn’t surprised to see the 
door to his room standing open. 
Mrs. Jeffries often brought food to 
the students’ rooms and put it in 
their ’frigs. She said she cooked too 
much, but she did it often. Kevin 
went in without thinking. 

The room was empty. All his 
hooks had been tumbled from the 
shelves onto the floor. His cal- 
t iilator was a heap of rubble in the 
center of the floor. The refrigerator 
d(H)r stood open, and everything that 



had been in it was poured into a 
hideous soup over his books. 

When he went into the bathroom 
he found Snowdrop drowned in the 
toilet.

“Dr. Farrington?’’ 

“Yes, Kevin?’’ 

“Can I see you for a moment, 
sir? I need help.’’ 

“Sure.’’ Professor Farrington’s 
grin was reassuring. Of all Kevin’s 
professors, Farrington was the only 
one who seemed actually interested 
in the students. He was a bulky 
man, heavy set and going to fat; 
forty years before he’d been a foot- 
ball star, but he had little time for 
physical activities now. 

His classes were interesting. He 
taught what was in the books but he 
often spoke of other things as well, 
of a world remade by technology 
and engineering, of man’s future. 
“We’re in a bad phase right now,’’ 
Farrington said many times, “but 
that won't last. These things come 
in waves. Right now the social 
theorists are on top, and they don’t 
trust people. It won’t last. You’ll all 
live to see a new era, an era of 
freedom and individual respon- 
sibilities, and I want you to be 
ready for it.’’ 

He waved Kevin toward his office 
and followed along the hall. His 
steps were slow; Farrington seemed 
always physically tired, but he 



EXILES TO GLORY

spoke with an animation that denied 
it. They went into the office, a large 
room lined with books, drafting ta- 
ble beneath the windows, a large 
read-out screen on the battered wood 
desk. “Have a seat,” Farrington 
said. “Now, what can I do for 
you?” 

Kevin showed him the computer 
letter and described his interview 
with Ms. Rasmussen. “And I can’t 
afford two more years,” he con- 
cluded. “It’s just not fair.” 

“No, probably not. Fair play isn’t 
the strongest point of our regulated 
welfare state. Rules and order, 
that’s our goal. Let me have your 
ID card, I need to look up your re- 
cords.” 

Kevin handed it over. “Two 
years because a computer says so. 
That doesn’t make sense.” 

“Makes more than you think.” 
Farrington inserted the ID card into 
a slot in the desk console. He began 
punching in numbers. “When you 
admit everyone who wants to go to 
college, and you’re not allowed to 
flunk anybody out, you have to 
have some way to keep from getting 
hip-deep in idiots-with-degrees,” 
Farrington said. “Too bad it hap- 
pened to the engineering school too. 
I remember when this kind of horse 
puckey was reserved for the Sociol- 
ogy and Education Departments. 
And law schools, of course.” 

“But can’t you do something?” 

Farrington studied the read-outs. 
“Probably not. Used to be the pro- 
fessors had some authority here, but 



not for a long time now. Rules are 
rules — ’ ’ 

“Not you too!” 

“Easy. Doesn’t do any good to 
get excited. Least not here, not with 
me. Kevin, I can understand why 
you young people get frustrated. If 
things like this had happened to me 
when I was your age I’d have been 
scheming on how to bring the whole 
mess down in blood. I don’t sup- 
pose your generation even talks like 
that.” 

Kevin said nothing. Farrington 
was right. A couple of times Kevin 
had complained about some rule or 
another, tried to get a student pro- 
test together, and his classmates had 
thought he was crazy. The only stu- 
dent demonstrations to get involved 
in were those sponsored by one of 
the recognized outfits. Demonstrat- 
ing for the right causes was a key to 
a good job after graduation. Making 
trouble was a way to welfare. 

“1 can’t give you a degree by 
waving my hand,” Farrington said. 
“But we can diddle the system a 
bit. You stay on. I’ll see that you 
get admitted to graduate courses. 
You can enroll in these junk courses 
they want you to take again, but 
you won’t have to go to class. Just 
show up on exam day. When 
you’ve touched all the bases you’ll 
get your degree and have two years 
of advanced study to go with it. Get 
you a better job.” 

“It sounds good,” Kevin said. 
“But I can’t do it — ” 

“I wasn’t through,” Farrington

said. “Lx)ok, Tve got some buddies 
out at Systems Development Cor- 
poration. I can get you on part-time 
as a draftsman at SDC. Get you 
some experience programming, 
Iceding problems into the computer, 
lhat sort of thing. Won’t pay too 
had, and you’ll have job experience 
m your resume. Ought to about 
make up for the time this stupid 
system is costing you.” 

''But I still can’t,” Kevin said. 

Td love to. What you’re offering 
IS better than — Dr. Farrington, it 
would be great, and I really thank 
you, but I can’t stay in Los 
Angeles.” 

Farrington frowned. “Why not?” 

Kevin told him. “I might have 
I bought it wasn’t serious, but when 
I found Snowdrop in the toilet — ” 
lie couldn’t finish. The memory of 
wel fur was in his nostrils. 

Farrington’s lips tightened. “You 
know, a few years ago — I guess it 
was longer than that. Back about 
F)S(). I knew a guy named Turk. 
Sold custom car parts. One of those 
damned street gangs decided Turk 
i)ught to kick in to them. Pay pro- 
leelion. 

"The cops couldn’t do anything: 
imlges didn’t believe in Juvenile 
eriminals. ‘No such thing as a bad 
ehild,’ all that crap. One day Turk 
c ame home and found his dog puk- 
ing blood all over the carpet. Seems 
someone had fed it meat filled with 
)’ round glass. So Turk went hunting. 
Me look a shotgun over to the gang 
lu adquarters and blew hell out of 



the place. Then he cruised around 
the city looking for their cars and 
blew off four or five. You know, 
old Turk lived another two, three 
years, finally died of a very natural 
heart attack. I understand that gang 
still goes out to the cemetery every 
month to be sure Turk’s still under 
ground.” 

“I couldn’t do that!” There was 
horror in Kevin’s voice. 

“No, I don’t reckon you could. 
Mind if I look up your psych re- 
cords?” 

“No, sir.” 

Farrington played with the con- 
sole keys. A series of graphs came 
onto the screen. “Know what these 
mean?” 

“No. They wouldn’t let me take 
any advanced psych courses. I don’t 
know why.” 

“I do,” Farrington said. He 
pointed to a series of dips and val- 
leys on one of the graphs. “Those 
little wiggles right there. Unstable. 
Potential for violence. You got a hot 
temper?” 

“Sometimes. I try to control it,” 
Kevin said. 

“Yeah. You’ve got some other 
problems too. Kind of a misfit, 
aren’t you?” 

“No!” Kevin almost shouted it. 
“I get along!” 

“Have many friends?” 

“Yes — well, I don’t have time to 
make many friends. But I get 
along.” 

“Sure,” Farrington said. “But I 
expect you have to work on that in-

dividualist streak. I see they had 
you in for intensive counseling for a 
couple of years. Help any?” 

“Sure. Sensitivity training is im- 
portant, particularly for those who 
hope to be promoted into managerial 
positions — ” 

“You don’t need to quote the 
goddam course prospectus to me,” 
Farrington said. He leaned back in 
his big chair. “Kevin, when I was 
your age, an engineer built things. 
Took responsibilities. They’d give 
us a project and by God we’d get it 
done. Build a bridge. Design 
something. Start with paper and 
ideas and see it through until it 
worked. Nowadays they put you in 
a room full of people just like your- 
self, and you feed numbers into a 
computer. Somebody checks all 
your work, somebody else origi- 
nated it, and a third type will super- 
vise the hardware — do you think 
you’ll like that?” 

“No,” Kevin admitted. “But 
what can I do?” 

Farrington shrugged. “Not much. 
Not here, anyway.” 

“I mean,” Kevin said, “the sys- 
tem’s so set up that no one person 
can ruin things for everybody. Isn’t 
that the way it’s supposed to 
work?” 

“Sure. How it’s supposed to 
work.” Farrington fingered the 
computer letter that lay on his desk, 
then looked back at the console. He 
seemed to be debating with himself. 
“Senecal, I’m going to tell you 
something that I don’t want you to 



repeat. You say I told you this, and 
I’ll deny it.” 

“Sir? I can — I don’t have to tell 
people everything I know.” 

“No, I don’t expect you do,” 
Farrington said. “Look, that com- 
puter letter was no accident. The 
psych people have decided you’re 
not ready to graduate. If they hadn’t 
found problems with your prere- 
quisites they’d have come up with 
something else.” 

“But— why?” 

“You’re not mature enough. Not 
group-adjusted. See those little code 
numbers? That’s the clue.” 

Kevin leaned over the desk and 
looked at the read-out screen. The 
numbers meant nothing to him. “I 
don’t think those were on the print- 
outs I got,” Kevin said. “I sent for 
my records. Don’t they have to tell 
us everything in them? I thought 
there was a law — ” 

“Oh, there are laws and laws,” 
Farrington said. “One law says that 
if properly qualified human-re- 
sources specialists determine that 
giving a subject information would 
be damaging to the subject, the in- 
formation can be withheld. There 
are some others, too. I’m not even 
supposed to be able to get this, not 
even with your ID card, but — well, 
a couple of my old students de- 
signed the computer security sys- 
tem. Anyway. The Psych boys have 
decided you ought to stay on as a 
student a couple more years. Then 
they’ll decide if your new profile is 
good enough to let you have a de-

;»rcc. My guess is that it’ll still be 
no,’ and it won’t matter if you stay 
on as an undergraduate until you’re 
ninety.” 

‘‘But what can I do?” Kevin de- 
manded. 

“1 don’t know. One of the unions 
might help you, but you can’t join 
a good union without a degree. Got 
any pull? Political friends? Ever 
worked campaigns?” 

“No.” 

“Then I can’t think of anything. I 
wish I could help. I really do.” 
l arrington opened his desk drawer 
and took out a printed brochure. 

' There’s one thing. This outfit’s 
looking for good general systems 
engineers, and they don’t care about 
degrees. They want ability, and I 
ihink you’ve got signs of that. You 
did a good paper for me last term. 
I'll recommend you, if you like.” 
He scaled the brochure across the 
<lesk. 

The illustration on the front 
leaped out at him; space as black as 
night; the Milky Way a sparkling 
waterfall of stars. Against the 
hackdrop hung a small rock. Men 
Moated in the foreground. A large 
mirror focussed solar energy onto 
I he asteroid, boiling out metals. 

“The Daedalus Corporation,” 
Kevin said. “That’s a deep-space 
outfit.” 

Farrington nodded. “One of 
I hem. And they’re hungry. Want me 
lo talk to them for you?” 

Kevin knew there were companies 
o|)erating in the Asteroid Belt, but 



he’d never thought of working for 
one of them. When he thought of 
going to space it was always in 
terms of one of the near-Earth or- 
biting factories, or possibly to the 
Hansen-MacKenzie base on the 
Moon. There was real money to be 
made in the industrial satellite fac- 
tories — and you could come home 
to spend it. 

“Nobody ever comes back from 
the Belt,” Kevin said. 

“Not many have, yet,” Far- 
rington agreed. “But maybe they 
don’t want to come home. They’re 
doing something real out there in 
the Belt, Kevin. Something impor- 
tant for the whole human race, and 
it’s not done with acres of engineers 
sitting in bullpens. They’re going to 
build a whole new civilization out 
there — and maybe save this one in 
the bargain. If I were your age I 
wouldn’t hesitate a minute.” 

For a moment the intensity of 
Farrington’s tone, the professor’s 
sincerity and wistful expression, 
made it sound attractive. Kevin 
thought again. He knew almost no- 
thing about the Belt. There were 
stories. That they’d found fabu- 
lously rich sources of metals, mil- 
lions of tons of nearly pure iron and 
nickel and copper, with solar energy 
to run the refineries. “But they’ve 
never brought anything back,” Ke- 
vin said aloud. 

“No. And if they don’t pretty 
soon things will be bad for the as- 
teroid industries,” Farrington said. 
“But that’s just the point. They 



TXILES TO GLORY 



19 




need people out there. People who’ll 
work — ’ ’ 

“How can they bring enough 
metal back to Earth to matter? The 
asteroids are a long way out.” 
“There are ways,” Farrington 
said. 

“I just don’t know — ” 

“Yes.” Farrington sighed. “I 
know. You’ve been brought up to 
think somebody will take care of 
you. Social Security, National 
Health Plan, Federal Burial Insur- 
ance. Family Assistance, Food 
Stamps, Welfare. Union representa- 
tives to speak for you. And I'm 
talking about a place where it’s all 
up to you, where you take care of 
yourself because nobody’s going to 
do it for you. I guess that can be 
scary to modern kids. You don’t 
like the idea, do you?” 

“It’s not that,” Kevin said. “But 
I never really thought about the 
Belt. It’s not what I had in mind for 
myself — I’m sorry.” 

“Nothing to be sorry about. It’s 
an alien way of life. For you. Me, I 
wish 1 was young enough to go. 
Enough of that. Kevin, I’ll think 
about your problem. Maybe we can 
come up with something. Now, if 
you’ll excuse me. I’ve got to pre- 
pare for my next class.” 

“Yes, sir. Thank you.” 

“Nothing to thank me for. I wish 
I could have been some help. Nice 
seeing you. Drop in again — I mean 
that. Come see me again in a couple 
of days. Maybe I’ll have thought of 
something.” 



“Thank you. I will.” But you 
probably won’t have thought of 
anything, Kevin thought as he left 
the office. 

Alfred Farrington continued to 
stare at the computer read-out screen. 
He took out a thin black notebook 
and copied some of the data into it, 
then frowned and selected a name 
on a roller index attached to the in- 
put console. He pushed a button and 
the phone dialed itself. It rang 
twice. 

“Yeah?” The phone showed a fat 
man about Farrington’s age. 

“Alf. How are you, Ben?” 

“Fine, except for recruiting — ” 
“Yes. I thought 1 had you a good 
prospect, but he may not work out. 
Then again, he may.” 

“Something special about this 
one: 

“Good prospect. No family ties, 
nobody’s going to worry about him, 
nothing here for him to spend 
money on. Engineering student. 
And a pretty good one compared to 
the lot we get now.” 

“Umm. The ship’s leaving pretty 
soon. Think you can get him 
aboard? We’re short on engineering 
talent. I’ve been thinking maybe we 
ought to ask Paul to send out a 
couple of the Order — ” 

“Possibly. I hope it doesn’t come 
to that. I doubt if he’d do it,” Far- 
rington said. “We’ve few enough in 
the Fellowship. Better to hire some 
talent — ’ ’ 

“If we can. One way or another 
we’ve got to get moving now, or the 



20

whole thing’s going to come apart. 
How good is this prospect?” 

“Potentially quite good. And no 
family. No one will worry about 
where he’s gone or when he’s 
coming back.” 

“Good.” 

“Of course his motivation’s all 
wrong,” Farrington said thought- 
fully. 

“To hell with motivation,” Ben 
said. “Get him aboard. We'll moti- 
vate him. And if we can’t, well, we 
can still get some use out of him.” 

“Yes. Well, I’ll send you his re- 
cords. If you like him, let me know, 
riiere may be more pressures I can 
put on him. Now what about those 
others I sent over?” 

They talked for a long time. 

★ ★ ★ 

The new locks to Kevin’s room 
hadn’t been disturbed. The door 
hadn’t been opened. It hadn’t had to 
be. 

Kevin’s black tomcat was nailed 
to the door. The cat mewed pite- 
ously. Kevin gulped hard and 
examined the wounds. He knew 
what had to be done, and after a 
moment he did it. Then he sat on 
the floor with tears streaming from 
his eyes. 

After a while he heard steps be- 
hind him. Sergeant Mason came 
into the upstairs hallway. 

“Your landlady called,” the 
policeman said. “The desk man 
passed it on to me.” He looked at 



the still body nailed to the door. 
“You got your keys?” 

“Yes—” 

“Go inside. Carefully. Here, let 
me open that. You get back over 
there.” Mason used the keys, stood 
back and kicked the door open. The 
room hadn’t been disturbed. “I’d 
say it’s all right,” Mason said. 
“They don’t usually do anything fi- 
nal after a warning like — like that. 
Not for a couple of days. Go get 
your face cleaned up, son. Go on, 
get.” 

Kevin went to the washroom. 
When he came back the body was 
gone. Sergeant Mason was sponging 
off the dark spots on the door. 

“That’s not evidence either, I 
suppose,” Kevin said. His voice 
held bitterness. 

“Evidence? Sure it’s evidence. 
Of childish pranks. Cruel, of 
course, but deprived children often 
express aggression in cruelty. It’s 
relatively harmless. We must weigh 
the importance of human life against 
that of an animal, and of course 
there can be only one deci- 
sion — look, kid. I’m not saying 
what I believe. I’m just quoting.” 

“Children! They’re no better than 
animals! Bad animals.” 

“Sure. You know that. I know it. 
But make the DA and the judges 
believe it — Look, son, the judges 
are picked by the lawyers, and the 
lawyers get paid by the government 
to defend these deprived kids. The 
lawyers all live in closed com- 
munities with rent-a-cops. So do the

pets. It's the way things are. You

around, and you can forget all 



The policeman’s face went hard. 
“Look, 1 don’t like it either. I can 
give you some protection, but 
we've only got so many police. 
And the Green Fence is never going 
to forget that you killed one of 
theirs. They’ll remember a long 
time. A long time, Kevin.’’ 

“But this is insane!’’ Kevin sat 
on the couch and looked at the 
familiar books — stained and dam- 
aged now — on all the walls. The 
world no longer made any sense. 
“You’re telling me this gang is 
more powerful than the govern- 
ment!’’ 

Mason shrugged. “Maybe. What 
do you want us to do? Go lean on 
those kids? Rig up evidence? 
Senecal, I’ve got nineteen years in. 
I can retire in another year. You got 
any idea what happens to cops who 
bend the rules that way? The Public 
Defender and the Civil Liberties 
Union and all the others would have 
my head on a platter! Sure, there’s 
lots of us would like to get those 
scumbags off the streets any way we 
can. But we’ve learned better, 
Senecal. They got Lieutenant 
Mogowa for tampering with evi- 
dence and they sent him to prison. 
He lived about a week. Not me, 
son. Not me. I got a wife and three 



kids — and none of ’em cops, 
either.’’ 

“So you’ll wait until they kill 
me — 

“And then maybe I can nail ’em 
for it. And if I do they’ll be on the 
streets in a year. Yeah. That’s the 
way it is, Senecal. Got any more 
beer?’’ 

“Yes, but you’ll have to excuse 
me. I’ve got to go make a telephone 
call. Maybe I can catch Dr. Far- 
rington in his office.”

Kevin had never seen so many 
forms and tests. There were dozens 
of them, and they asked him for 
information that no sane person 
would know. Finally he threw down 
his pencil. “This is ridiculous!” he 
shouted. 

Three other job applicants who 
were still working looked up in an- 
noyance, then went back to their 
tests. The test monitor, a pretty girl 
in short skirts, frowned. “You must 
complete your tests — ” 

“I will be damned if 1 will,” 
Kevin said. He stalked out of the 
room as the girl pleaded with him to 
go back and finish. 

That blows that, Kevin thought. 
Damnation. 1 thought a deep- 
space-operations outfit would — 

“Congratulations, Senecal. Come 
with me, please.” An elderly fat 
man barred his path. “Come on, 
we’re running low on time,” the 



22 



GAUXY 




man said. His voice was filled with 
authority. 

Kevin wanted to tell him to stuff 
it, but he had nothing to lose. He 
followed the man through twisting 
hallways, then into an elevator. The 
man didn’t speak until they got off 
at the top floor of the Santa Monica 
office building. 

Downstairs the building had been 
coldly professional: new, expensive, 
and utterly without warmth. Up here 
it was completely different. The 
carpets were old but comfortable. 
Holos of space mining operations 
hung along the walls. People were 
dressed casually, and worked in 
small groups, or alone, and some 
sat in their offices with their feet on 
the desk and eyes directed to the 
ceiling. One man was making a pa- 
|x^r airplane. 

They went to the end of the hall 
and into an office. It too was com- 
fortably furnished, and reminded 
Kevin of Professor Farrington’s 
room. 

“I’m Ben Simington,” the fat 
man said. “Have a seat.” 

The chairs were comfortable. 

“Want a drink? Scotch. Yes. 1 
recommend scotch whiskey, a dou- 
ble.” 

Simington went to a wall panel, 
touched it, and let it swing open. 
An elaborate wet bar was behind it. 
He took out glasses carved with 
strange creatures and poured, then 
handed one to Kevin. The figure on 
Kevin’s glass was a phoenix. 
‘‘Cheers,” Simington said. 



Kevin lifted the glass and sipped. 
The whiskey was smooth, much 
better than any scotch he'd ever had 
before. 

“Confused?” Simington asked. 

“Yes.” 

“Think about it.” 

Kevin did. What data had he? 
The contrast between the lower floor 
of the Daedalus building, coldly 
professional, like hundreds of others 
all over the city, and the relaxed at- 
titudes of the people on this 
floor — all of them obviously high- 
ranking executives even if they 
didn’t act like it — was indeed con- 
fusing. This office, plain, but with 
very expensive carpets and pictures 
and electronic equipment — Kevin 
realized that he had, in all his life 
put together, never spent as much 
money as this office must have cost, 
yet the impression was of comfort 
and utility, not ostentation. 

Then there were the tests. Medi- 
cal exams, of course, then the 
others. The first ones had been sen- 
sible, related to systems engineer- 
ing, digging deep into his knowl- 
edge. Others were obviously 
psychological tests, and all big 
companies used those. But after 
that — those forms, which asked for 
things like grandmother’s age at 
death, great-grandfather’s occupa- 
tion, every address at which he had 
ever lived. They’d made no sense, 
and they got worse as he went 
along. Why? What would the 
Daedalus Corporation want with 
such information? 



EXILES TO GLORY

Nothing. They couldn’t want it. 
So why ask for it? 

“You expected me to give up on 
those tests,” Kevin said. 

“Let’s say we hoped you would. 
But not too soon. Part of the test 
score is the time it takes for the 
applicants to tell us to go to hell. 
Quit too soon, we don’t need you. 
Not enough motivation. Keep on 
after it’s too obvious the things are 
useless, and — well, you came off 
pretty good.” 

“But—” 

“Many of the chaps down there 
still wading through will get jobs,” 
the fat man said. “We need paper 
shufflers too. But we wouldn’t send 
them out to the Belt. I take it you 
do still want the Job.” 

“Yes.” Kevin's voice was un- 
necessarily strong. He realized that, 
but didn’t explain. 

“Why?” Ben Simington prompt- 
ed. 

“Because there’s got to be 
something better than — ” He didn’t 
know how to finish. Better than 
here, where teenaged gangsters tor- 
tured cats and threatened people and 
the courts protected them. Better 
than a world where there were reg- 
ulations upon regulations, where 
every detail of your working life was 
supervised by Federal inspectors and 
union officials, where you could gel 
into trouble for working too hard, 
where they told you that all the reg- 
ulation was the price of a stable 
world economy and then they 
couldn’t protect you from street 



gangsters. Better than — “Better 
than always having forms to fill out 
and people who think the forms are 
important,” he said. 

Simington nodded. “Good. We 
need people who want their work to 
make sense. But don’t get the idea 
that it always will, Kevin. Some- 
times there’s things to be done 
whether they make .sen.se or not. 
Still, you won’t find loo much 
monkey motion out where you'll be 
going. You’ll have to take eare of 
yourself, but you won’t mind that. 
Wish 1 could go along Drink up.” 

Kevin took another healthy sip of 
excellent whiskey It went down 
sm(K)thly and warmed him from the 
inside out that and the fat man’s 
camaraderie. Ih* liki*d the leeling. 
Kevin was intelligent enough to 
know it was all deliberate, that it 
was all planned to make him feel 
welcome, hut he liketl that too. 
fhe se people wanted him, and they 
cared about how he lelt 

riiey tiilked loi an hour. The fat 
man hniked at Kevin’s test scores, 
his medii al levoids. Ins file from

said.

sighed. “You’d think I’d have 
thousands of volunteers,” he said. 
“And I do, but not qualified people. 
The Belt’s not the same as a quick 
tour in orbit. Don’t kid yourself that 
it is. They’re spread thin out there. 
A couple of thousand people, 
mostly on Ceres, spread across 
billions of cubic miles. It’s no pic- 
nic, Kevin.” 

“No.” He hadn’t expected a pic- 
nic. He thought about the vast emp- 
tiness of the Belt. It wasn’t a place 
he’d go by choice — but what 

choices had he? There were plenty 
of volunteers for the factories orbit- 
ing Earth, and what use would Ke- 
vin Senecal be to one of them? Of- 
ficially he was neither engineer nor 
good millhand. He was nothing. It 
wouldn’t be that way in the Belt, 
and that was something to think 
about. 

"Wayfarer leaves in four days,” 
Simington said. “Can you be in 
her?” 

“Four days! Mr. Simington, I 
don’t really know anything about 
space industries, and I can’t learn in 
four days!” 

“We don’t expect you to. Trip 
out takes nine months. You’ll learn 
more about space operations than 
you really want to know. Nothing 
else to do aboard ship. There’ll be a 
reader and plenty of tapes. Ship’s 
crew drills you in equipment, 
p-suits, getting around outside. 
You’ll learn to live in low gravity or 
you won’t live at all. I’m not wor- 
ried about what you’ll know when 



you get to Ceres. It’s whether you’ll 
stick it out that bothers me.” 

“I generally fmish what I start,” 
Kevin said. 

“Yep. One reason I’m talking to 
you is because your coach told me 
how you finished a game with two 
broken ribs. Didn’t play too well, 
but you finished." 

“That was in high school.” Just 
how far back had Daedalus gone in 
checking his background? But it 
made sense: he was going to cost 
them a lot of money. “I still don't 
understand why you want me,” Ke- 
vin said. 

Simington shrugged. “Who do 
we send out, Kevin? Not super- 
heroes trained for one mission; 
most of the astronauts came apart 
when their tour was over. Senior 
engineers? Why would they go? 
They’re doing all right here. No, 
we’ve found our best people are 
misfits who don’t like our modem 
welfare state. If they’ve got some 
other reason to get them headed for 
the Beit, that’s fine; but it's what 
they do when they get there that 
counts.” The fat man looked down 
at the data sheets on his desk. 
“Look, I don’t believe in a lot of 
this psych garbage, but some of it’s 
useful. In some ways I may know 
you better than you know yourself. ’ ’ 

There wasn’t anything Kevin 
could say to that. 

“Contract’s for five years,” 
Simington said. “But we don’t re- 
ally make a lot of profit on five 
years. We need people who’ll go

the course.” He went back to 
studying the read-outs. 

Kevin suddenly wanted very 
badly to go. Partly it was a com- 
petitive urge. He didn’t want to be 
told he wasn’t good enough. But 
there was more, too. Out there he 
might find a meaningful job and a 
chance to do something important. 

Earth was running out of metals, 
of oil, of coal, of everything. The 
anti-technology organizations had 
halted nuclear power development 
and Eco-freak rioters had smashed 
the space-power antenna outside 
Bakersfield — and investment money 
to build another couldn’t be found. 
Population was rising and food pro- 
duction wasn’t. There were already 
famines in parts of the world, and 
the pinch was felt everywhere, even 
in the United States. And the 
lawyers continued to gum up ev- 
erything — in the courts, permit 
hearings, environmental impact state- 
ments. 

The One Earth Society said the 
answer was to eliminate technology, 
space industries, everything that 
wasn’t “natural.” The costs would 
be terrible: millions, billions dead, 
but there was nothing else. Earth 
must abide, and she could not sup- 
port a plague of mankind, an 
epidemic of humanity. 

Kevin remembered Professor Far- 
rington’s lecture on that. “Maybe 
they’re right,” Farrington had said. 
“Maybe. But it’s for damn sure if 
there’s an alternative this is the time 
to take it. We can get off the Earth 



and live in the solar svstem. Not on 
one planet, but on nine of them, 
nine planets, thirty-five moons, and 
a million asteroids. Right now we 
can go. If we wait a few years, 
things will be so desperate down 
here we’ll never make it. This is the 
first and last opportunity for man- 
kind to be something more than a 
carnivorous ape crawling on the sur- 
face of one insignificant planet.” 
Kevin, remembering, nodded to 
himself. “I want to go,” he said. 
“And I can make it in four days.” 
Simington said nothing for a long 
time. Kevin held his breath. Finally 
the fat man spoke. “Okay. I can 
offer you a starting salary of four- 
teen thousand Swiss francs a year. 
Five-year contract.” 

Kevin made rapid mental calcula- 
tions. About a hundred and fifty 
thousand US dollars a year. It 
wasn’t as high as he’d expected; not 
that high at all in these days of in- 
flation and ultra-taxation. Engineers 
on Earth made more. Engineers in 
orbital factories made a lot more. 
But — it was more than he could get 
without degrees and a strong union. 

“It’s more than you think,” 
Simington was saying. “We pay 
half that in francs in the Belt, the 
other half into your account in 
Zurich. We’ll set that up for you. 
No point in letting Uncle Sugar get 
his hands on your money. If you 
don’t have too much junk shipped 
out from Earth, you can save your 
return passage in about four years.” 
“And if I don’t save?” 



26 



GALAXY 




Simington shrugged. “Your prob- 
lem. We pay your way out. If you 
stay ten years with us, we pay your 
way back in. Don’t worry about 
it. Even if you can’t cut it for us, 
you won’t be out of a job. There’s 
a lot more jobs than people in 
the Belt. You won't starve.’’ 

‘T suppose not — ” 

“And we give you a sign-up 
bonus,” Simington said. “Thirty- 
five thousand bucks. You can use 
that to clean up any Earth-side 
problems. WeTl also provide you 
with a basic outfit.” 

“Sounds good,” Kevin said. 

“It is good. We take care of our 
people. Notice I haven’t said any- 
thing about owing us for passage 
and bounty. Some outfits pay 
higher, but their people owe for 
passage out. Some never do save it 
back. We don’t work that way.” 
Sure, Kevin thought. But you’re 
out to make a profit like the others. 

Profit. Most of his professors had 
acted as if profits were nasty. Only 
Farrington seemed to think differ- 
ently. And Wiley Ralston, of 
course. Not that the professors had 
any control; international firms sur- 
vived despite the intellectuals’ con- 
tempt. The welfare state could tax 
US corporations practically out of 
existence, but they couldn’t get their 
hands on the internationals, or the 
space operations firms. 

“What kind of work?” Kevin 
asked. 

Simington’s grin was wide. “Ev- 
erything! Mining operations, living 



quarters, refinery design, ships and 
transport, agriculture — it all needs 
doing. Terrific opportunity.” 

If it’s that great, why do you 
need me? Kevin wondered. But it 
sounded exciting, and besides, what 
other choice did he have? “I’ll take 
it.” 

Simington nodded. “Report here, 
ready to leave, in two days.” 

★ ★ ★ 

They flew him down to the Baja 
California spaceport in a windowless 
transport. He crouched with his gear 
among empty cargo containers and 
tried not to think of what was com- 
ing next. There was only one other 
passenger, a man more than twice 
Kevin’s age, shorter by five inches 
but weighing almost as much as 
Kevin did — built like a lineman 
rather than a half back. He had dark 
hair and brown eyes, and a fine 
network of thin red lines around his 
mouth and across the bridge of his 
nose. He drank heavily from a hip 
flask. 

“Drink?” he asked. 

“No, thanks.” 

The man shrugged. “Headed for 
WayfarerT" When Kevin nodded 
the man’s grin broadened. He put 
out his hand. “Me, too. Bill 
Dykes.” 

Kevin took the offered hand. 
Dykes’s grip was firm. “Kevin 
Senecal.” He waited for Dykes to 
comment on the name, but he 
didn’t. 



EXILES TO GLORY

“Sure you don't want that drink? 
You look nervous.” 

“No, Vm not nervous,” Kevin 
said. “Wish they had windows back 
here. Td like to see Baja.” 

“Not much to see,” Dykes said. 
“Railroads, power lines, highways, 
looks Just like anyplace else now. 
Not like it was a few years ago 
when there wasn’t but one road 
down here. Damndest thing. Of all 
the places in the world to put a 
spaceport. I’d have thought Baja 
would be the last.” 

The airplane engines thrummed 
on. Kevin was glad of someone to 
talk with. It took his mind off what 
was to come. Deep space, the 
Belt — but more terrifying was the 
way he'd get out there. “Good lo- 
cation,” Kevin said. “Further south 
than Canaveral, so there’s more 
eastward velocity. Takes less energy 
to get the pods in orbit. And it’s on 
the ecliptic. Anything launched from 
there has an easier time of it getting 
to the Belt — ” Kevin stopped, be- 
cause he could see he was boring 
his companion. “Sorry. You know 
all this.” 

“Some,” Dykes admitted. 
“You’ve been up before?” 

Dykes nodded. “Orbital factories. 
Three years in the General Motors 
satellite. Didn’t want to join up for 
another hitch. Took my pay back to 
Earth . ’ ’ 

“But — you must have saved a 
lot—” 

“Sure, but the IRS got most of 
it.” Dykes took another drink. 



“And I couldn't get a dirt side job. 
My union’s full of One Earthers. 
They say space technology takes 
jobs away from people on Earth. 
Sweet Lord, they fixed up an initia- 
tion fee that would've wiped me 
out! Tried working without a union, 
but you know how that is. Got beat 
up about as many times as I had a 
day’s work.” 

Dykes didn’t seem broken up 
about his problems. He smiled cheer- 
fully and took another drink, a long 
one this time. “So I took what was 
left of my savings and headed for 
the Moon.” 

“Oh.” The Moon might be a 
good place to work. “Hansen col- 
ony?” Kevin asked. 

“Naw, couldn’t get on there. If 
MacKenzie and Hansen had been 
hiring. I’d probably still be up. No 
mickey mouse crap with Hansen, 
they tell me. Just hard work. Naw, I 
tried a little prospecting, a little 
mining. Luna’s no good. Regula- 
tions, bureaucrats, lawyers, taxes 
— hell, it's no different from Earth. 
No chance to get anywhere.” 

“So you’re going to the Belt?” 
“Sure. So’ re you. What in hell 
are you so nervous about?” 

Kevin laughed. “Didn’t know it 
showed that much. I — have you 
been up in a laser pod before?” 
“Yeah. Four times. Lived 
through all but the second one.” 
“Huh?” 

“That one killed me.” Dykes 
held his serious expression for a 
moment, then grinned. “Look, 



28 



GALAXY 




there’s nothing to worry about.” 

“Sure,” Kevin said. “Sure. Say, 
if you don’t mind. I’ll have a drink 
after all.” 

★ ★ ★ 

The plane set down in morning 
tropical heat. There was no wind. 
The airfield was located near the 
launching facility, but a large con- 
crete terminal building blocked their 
view of the laser field beyond. They 
watched their baggage loaded onto a 
cart, then went into the terminal. 

There were few formalities. Ke- 
vin showed his ticket and was 
checked off a list. “First time up?” 
the clerk asked. When Kevin ad- 
mitted it, he was sent down a long 
stairway. 

“See you,” Dykes called. 

The passage led to a waiting 
room. There were a dozen other 
people there, mostly men older than 
he was, but a few women, and one 
family with two children. There was 
also a remarkably pretty girl. Kevin 
icntatively smiled at her, but she 
didn't respond, so he took out a 
book and began reading. 

Presently a man in white coveralls 
came in and waited for their atten- 
tion. He didn’t say anything, just 
stood there until they were all 
looking at him. He looked at the 
two children and shuddered. 

“Anybody here can’t follow in- 
structions? I mean follow ’em to the 
letter?” he asked. “If so, speak up 
and save the Company some money. 



Save your lives, for that matter. 
You can get killed doing something 
stupid.” 

There was still no response. He 
shrugged. ‘M'm Hal Winstein, and 
I’m supposed to tell you ground- 
hogs how to eel from here to the 
orbit station alive. After that you’re 
.somebody else's worry. 

“You all have pressure suits and 
helmets that ftt? You should have 
turned them in for inspection. 
Everybody do that?” 

There were murmurs, but no one 
said anything. 

“Okay. Next. Anybody seriously 
suffer from claustrophobia? Course 
not, you wouldn’t be here, but I’m 
supposed to ask. Now here’s the 
drill. You’ll go get your suits on 
and eet checked out. Check-out in- 
eludes vacuum test to be sure your 
equipment works. When the techs 
are happy with your gear, you’ll go 
to the loading area and climb into a 
capsule. 

“The capsules hold two hundred 
kilos each. That’s approximately 
two people and their gear. We strap 
you in the webbing and you’ll be 
there a while. Eventually the cap- 
sules move to the launch area, 
you’ll hear a warning, and off you’ll 
go at three gravities. 

“Three gees isn’t all that much if 
you’re lying flat in the webbing. It 
goes on for a lot longer than you 
think it will, so don’t get worried. 
When it stops you’ll be in orbit. No 
weight.” 

“Free fall,” Kevin muttered. He 



EXILES TO GLORY 



29 




wondered how he’d feel. People 
often got sick in space. 

“That’s the only tricky part,’’ 
Winstein said. “You’ll feel like 
you’re falling forever. Don’t panic 
and don’t unstrap. Capsules with 
kids aboard will be taken into the 
orbiter airlock and opened there. 
The rest of you’ll have to get to the 
orbiter through vacuum. There’s 
only two important things to re- 
member: do exactly what the crew- 
man who comes for you says you 
should do, and never get completely 
unfastened. You’ll have two safety 
lines. Be sure one is attached to 
something before you unclip the 
other. The crew will get you into 
the airlock if you cooperate. If you 
don’t, you could get ver>' dead. Un- 
derstood?’’ 

“I think I will walk,’’ the family 
man said. The others didn’t laugh. 

“Don’t want to scare you,’’ 
Winstein said. “But you do want to 
take this serious. Any questions?’’ 

There weren’t many. Everyone 
there was a potential colonist or 
would work in one of the satellite 
factories. Laser launching was a lot 
cheaper than tickets on the shuttle, 
but the Hansen Company didn’t 
particularly encourage passenger 
traffic on the laser system: they 
made bigger profits on freight. Fi- 
nally Kevin raised his hand. 

“Yeah?’’ Winstein said. 

“Can we watch the launches? 
I’ve never seen one.” 

Winstein looked at his watch. “If 
you get through suit check fast, you 



can watch cargo go up for a few 
minutes. Then you’ll have to get 
below and load on. Okay, through 
this door to the changing rooms. 
Find your own gear and get it on.” 

“What do we do with our 
clothes?” one man asked. 

Winstein shrugged. “Carry ’em 
along if you don’t go over the mass 
marked on your ticket. Or ship ’em 
to somebody. Or leave ’em here and 
we’ll give ’em to local charities. 
Suit yourself. By the way — I don’t 
advise anybody to fudge on total 
weight. You wouldn’t really want us 
to think you mass less than you do. 
And we can’t afford to lose the cap- 
sules.” 



V 

There was very little privacy in 
the changing room. Only a long 
screen separated men from women. 
The only facilities were a long 
bench and table on either side of the 
screen . 

Kevin collected his pressure suit 
from the Hansen Company inspector 
who’d checked it out. “Nice gear,” 
the technician said as he handed it 
over. “David Clarke makes the 
best, in my book.” 

One more datum to file away, 
Kevin thought. Daedalus Corpora- 
tion didn’t stint on equipment. 
They’d given him the best. He had 
his suit, and helmet, with radios and 
tool belts; a programmable pocket 
computer, the latest model he knew

GALAXY 




of, complete with a plug-in mem- 
ory-reference unit that contained, 
along with much other data, just 
about every formula and table in the 
big Chemical Rubber Handbook; a 
lightweight Fiberglas suitcase, re- 
ally more like a pressure-tight port- 
able footlocker. It was all first class 
and it made him feel that he was 
important to the company. 

The pressure suit went on like a 
diver’s wet suit, and looked like one 
only not so thick. It fit very closely; 
he had to use talcum powder to get 
into it. Gloves dogged onto the ends 
of the sleeves, and a seal set firmly 
around his neck. He slipped into the 
boots, hung the small equipment 
bag over his shoulder, and reported 
back to the technicians. 

They pulled and pinched, looking 
for loose spots. They didn’t find any 
in Kevin’s, but the next to come up 
was the girl he’d seen before, and 
after a moment they handed her a 
lump of what looked like clay. 
“Shove that under your breasts,” 
the technician said. “Yeah, right 
there. Don’t leave any gaps.” 

“But — ” She was obviously em- 
barrassed. 

“Lady, you’re going into vac- 
uum,” the man explained. “Your 
innards will be pressured to about 
seven pounds by the air in your 
helmet. Outside is nothing. Your 
skin won’t hold that. The suit will, 
but you’ve got to be flat against the 
suit, otherwise yoiHl swell up to fill 
any empty spaces. It won’t do a lot 
of good for your figure. 



“Oh. Thank you,” she said. She 
turned av/vr and used the clav as 
she'd been told. 

The technician looked at Kevin 
and shook his head. “Don’t get 
many small-tovvn chicks here. Okay, 
sport, on with your helmet. See it’s 
dogged right. Don’t like to lose pas- 
sengers in the test chamber.” 

The helmet fit snugly onto the 
neck seal. The technician checked 
the locking mechanism and seemed 
satisfied. “Okay, you and blondie 
there, into the next room and 
through the airlock.” He raised his 
voice. “Sending in the first two, 
Charlie.” 

“Right. Come on, come on, we 
got a full schedule today.” 

Kevin and the girl went through 
the door and were motioned to 
another, this one steel with a large 
locking wheel. Through that was a 
large chamber. There was a man in 
a pressure suit inside it. He 
motioned to hoses on the bulkhead. 
“Connect up to those.” 

They did, and the man checked 
the fittings. “Okay,” he said. 
“We’ll pump out this chamber. As 
we do, there’ll come pressure into 
your helmets through those hoses. 
When the outside pressure’s gone, 
you’re going to be uncomfortable 
for a while. Any gas in your system 
will expand until you’ll feel like a 
balloon. Don’t be too damned polite 
to get rid of it, or you’ll be sorry. If 
you feel really uncomfortable, or 
your ears hurt real bad, or you can’t 
breathe, hit one of those panic but- 



EXILES TO GLORY 



31 




tons next to you there. Otherwise, 
don’t do anything at all. Under- 
stood?” 

“Yes,” the girl said. Kevin nod- 
ded. 

“Right.” Charlie turned to his 
control panel and pressed buttons. 
The outside door had already been 
closed and sealed while he was 
talking. 

Kevin felt the pressure drop. His 
ears clogged for a moment and he 
swallowed frantically until they 
popped and were clear. The pressure 
continued to fall and he felt his in- 
sides swelling as Charlie had said 
they would. 

“OKAY.” Charlie’s voice was 
loud in his headset. “I’ve got your 
pressures here. Everything looks 
right to me. Any problems?” 

“No,” the girl’s voice said. 

“Good. Now comes the hard 
part. The worst thing that can hap- 
pen to you is to run low on oxygen. 
You won’t know it’s happening. So, 
I’m gonna cut down on your oxygen 
supply to let you get used to what 
anoxia feels like. While I’m doing it 
I want you to write your name on 
that pad there in front of you. Every 
time I say ‘write,’ you write your 
name until I say to stop. Okay?” 

“Yes,” the girl’s voice said in 
his headset. 

“Sure,” Kevin said. 

“You, mister, I asked if it was 
understood,” Charlie said. 

“Oh.” Kevin turned on his mi- 
crophone. “Sorry. Understood.” 

“Okay. Here we go. Write.” 



It was no problem. He wrote 
carefully, then glanced over at the 
girl. ‘Ellen MacMillan.’ Her hand- 
writing was neat and precise, unlike 
his own heavy scrawl. 

“Write,” Charlie said, and they 
did it again. 

It seemed a silly game. Kevin felt 
an urgent impulse to laugh. Why? 
part of his mind wondered. But it 
didn’t matter, of course he wanted 
to laugh, this was silly — 

“Write.” 

His hand didn’t work properly, 
but it was all right, he was tired of 
this silly game. He glanced over at 
Ellen’s paper. Her neat hand had 
written ‘Coca-cola.’ 

‘Scotch and soda,’ Kevin wrote. 

“Write.” 

‘Will you have dinner with me?’ 
he tried to write, but it didn’t come 
out that way. He couldn’t read it. 
Oh, well. Ellen looked at him and 
giggled. He responded, and they 
laughed together. 

“Hey, you’re beautiful,” Kevin 
shouted. 

She laughed harder. Why was she 
laughing? Kevin wondered. It was 
true enough. Well, maybe not 
beautiful. But she was nice, a really 
pretty girl, blonde curls cut off short 
but still long enough to curl. He 
stared at her pressure suit, trying to 
see where her breasts left off and 
the clay began. She saw what he 
was doing and patted the spot, 
giggling again. 

“Write your names. It is very 
important that you write your 



32 



GALAXY 




names. If you do not write your 
names legibly you will not be per- 
mitted to go up today,” Charlie 
said. His voice was very stem, and 
that was funny too. 

Only, part of his mind said, it 
wasn’t funny. He tried very hard, 
but all he could produce was a 
scrawl. Ought to be good enough, 
though, he thought. They can read 
that — 

His head began to clear suddenly, 
and he looked at the paper in front 
of him. It was awful. He wanted to 
cry — 

He felt the chamber pressure ris- 
ing. It became very warm in the 
capsule. 

“Okay,” Charlie said. “When I 
give the signal, disconnect from the 
hoses and go out the far door. Take 
those papers with you, and don’t 
forget what you’ve learned. Anoxia 
sneaks up on you. You think you’re 
doing all right, even when you’re 
acting like a stupid drunk. If you 
remember that, you can function 
longer. Not a lot longer, but a little 
longer anyway.” 

★ ★ ★ 

The next stop was another supply 
counter, where he picked up his re- 
flective coveralls and tool belt. 
When he put them on over his pres- 
sure suit, and slung the tool belt 
around his waist, Kevin felt like a 
spacer. He knew better. There was a 
lot to learn, and he wouldn’t even 
get started learning it until he was 



aboard Wayfarer', but the tool kit 
and professional equipment was at 
least a start. He asked directions to 
the observation balcony and was 
shown a stairway. 

The balcony was empty. It gave a 
view of the wide valley on the other 
side of the terminal building from 
the airfield. The upper parts of the 
valley sides were covered with the 
tall cardones cactus plants, giants 
twenty feet tall and more, looking 
like cartoons of the desert cactus. 
There were even vultures perched in 
the cactus. Below, on the valley 
floor, were the lasers. 

At first it looked like a field of 
mirrors. Over a hundred lasers were 
scattered across the brown Baja de- 
sert sand. Each sent its output into a 
mirror. The mirrors were all ar- 
ranged so that they reflected onto 
one very large mirror nearly a 
kilometer beyond the balcony. 

A rail track ran onto a platform 
above the final mirror. Squat cap- 
sules, like enormously swollen ar- 
tillery shells, sat on cars on the 
track, a long line of them waiting 
for launch. As he watched, one of 
the capsules was wheeled along the 
track until it stopped over the 
launching mirror. 

The field became a blaze of 
blue-green light as the lasers went 
on. Somewhere nearby, Kevin 
knew, were two large nuclear power 
plants. They poured their entire out- 
put into the lasers below him, 
enough electricity to power a city, 
all turned into laser light. The mir- 



EXILES TO GLORY 



33 




rors pivoted slightly so that all their 
energy went to the one large mirror 
at the end of the field. 

The capsule rose, suddenly and 
silently, as if pushed into the sky by 
a rapidly growing giant blue-green 
beanstalk. It vanished in seconds, 
but the laser beam continued to fol- 
low it, moving from vertical to an 
angle toward the east. Finally all the 
lasers went out together. 

“My God,“ Kevin said aloud. 
“Fm going up like thatT" 

He heard a laugh behind him and 
turned quickly to see the girl who’d 
been in the altitude chamber with 
him. She smiled as he looked at 
her. “Yes, we are,“ she said. 
“Scared?” 

“Damn betcha.” 

“Me too. I wish Td taken the 
shuttle.” 

Another capsule was in position, 
and rose silently from the platform, 
vanishing into the clear blue sky, 
followed by the silent beam of in- 
tense light. If he listened carefully 
Kevin thought he could hear the 
hum of the beam. It was pulsed at 
something like two hundred times a 
second. 

The laser system worked like a 
ram jet. Under each capsule was a 
bell-shaped chamber, open at the 
bottom. The laser energy entered the 
chamber and heated the air inside. 
The air rushed out, pushing the cap- 
sule upward. Then the beam was 
turned off just long enough for more 
air to get into the chamber, to be 
heated by the next pulse of the beam. 



“Tm still not sure I believe it 
works,” Kevin said. “It looks like 
black magic.” 

“Green magic,” Ellen said. 

There was a long pause in the 
launching sequence, then a train- 
load of capsules came out. Each 
capsule was accompanied by 
an armed guard. Four Mexican 
Army tanks rolled alongside the 
train. 

“Ye gods, that must be a valu- 
able cargo,” Kevin said. He looked 
quickly at Ellen when she didn’t 
answer. She was watching them 
with a look of satisfaction. “Do you 
know what’s in them?” Kevin 
asked. 

“No, do you?” 

“I thought you were watching as 
if you did. No, I haven’t a clue.” 

“As you said, it must be valu- 
able.” She continued to stare until 
all the capsules were launched, and 
the guards and tanks rolled away. 
Then she looked at her watch. 
“Maybe we ought to be getting 
down — ” 

“Yes. Hate to miss the ship. 
Where are you headed?” 

Wayfarer. Das Wanderer/' 

Kevin had thought she would be 
going up to one of the orbital fac- 
tories. “All the way to Ceres? 
Alone?” 

“Yes, why not?” 

Kevin shrugged. “No reason.” 

“Except that you don’t approve 
of women going to the Belt,” she 
said. “That’s man’s work. I sup- 
pose you want restrictive laws for 



34 



GALAXY 




space, too. ‘One job per family’ out 
in the Belt as well as here on 
Earth.” There was anger in her 
voice. ‘‘Well, you had that in the 
United States, still do really, but 
you won’t get it in space, and I’m 
going whether you approve or not.” 
She turned and stalked down the 
stairwell. 

“Hey,” Kevin called. “Hey, I 
didn’t mean anything. I’m sorry — ” 

She didn’t turn. To hell with her, 
Kevin thought. He slowed down, 
wondering what to do next. 

“Kev! Hey, buddy,” someone 
called. 

Kevin turned. It was Wiley 
Ralston. “Wiley! Hey, are you go- 
ing up this round?” Wiley had left 
Los Angeles two weeks before to 
find a job in deep space. Kevin 
wasn’t that surprised to see him. 

“Sure, I’m in the afternoon 
wave. Ride up with me?” 

“Can’t,” Kevin said. “I’m going 
right now — hey, where are you go- 
ing?” 

“Got some things to arrange,” 
Wiley said. 

“You going in WayfarerT' 

“Right — you too?” Wiley was 
hurrying away, and his manner indi- 
cated that he didn’t want to be fol- 
lowed. “You’re going up right 
now? Not in the first capsule, 
though — ” 

“Sure, get it over with,” Kevin 
said. He had to shout now; Wiley 
was moving away fast. 

“Not the first,” Wiley said. “Get 
on the last one — ” 



“Why?” 

“Can’t stop to talk, old chum. 
I’ve really got to scoot. See you 
aboard Wayfarer He vanished into 
a door marked authorized per- 
sonnel ONLY, leaving Kevin 
standing in the middle of the empty 
corridor. 

Damn, Kevin thought. He walked 
slowly to the capsule loading area. 
If I wait, he thought. I’ll be scared 
out of my wits before it happens. 
He knew the laser launching system 
was safe, but that didn’t stop the 
butterflies in his stomach. 

May as well get it over with, he 
thought. He collected his helmet 
from the technicians. 

There was one couple, and Ellen 
MacMillan, in the loading area. 

“Who's first?” the technician 
asked. 

“We are,” the couple said. 

“Right. Let’s see you get into 
your hats and seal up.” When they 
had their helmets dogged down the 
technician attached a pressure gauge 
to the man, looked worried, and 
said, “Go back and get a recheck 
on this.” 

“Something wrong?” 

“Probably not, but I like to be 
careful. Okay, you’re downchecked. 
Next.” He jerked a thumb at Ke- 
vin, then at Ellen MacMillan. “You 
two. Get your heads on and let’s 
hook up air bottles. Come on, we 
haven’t got all day. Orbits don’t 
wait.” 

When they had donned helmets 
and air tanks the technician checked 



EXILES TO GLORY 



35 




his gauges again. “Looks good,” 
he said, and sent them through a 
door. Kevin hurried along, trying 
not to think of the ride ahead. No 
worse than a roller coaster, he kept 
telling himself. 

The launching pods were waiting. 
They seemed much larger than the 
ones he’d seen being launched, but 
even so the capsule was too small. 
It looked like a bell-shaped steel 
coffin. Ellen was already inside, 
strapping herself into a nylon-web- 
bing couch. Kevin got in and lay on 
the other couch. 

“Hear me all right?” a voice 
asked. 

“Yes.” They both answered at 
once, speaking a little too loudly, a 
little too confidently. Kevin turned 
toward Ellen to see that she was 
looking at him. They grinned faintly 
at each other. 

“Fine. Now you wait a while,” 
the tech’s voice said. “Then you 
go. There's nothing tricky about any 
of this. You’re hooked into the cap- 
sule air supply. When you make or- 
bit you wait until a crewman comes 
and opens the can. Then — and not 
before — you pull that big lever 
above you. It disconnects you from 
the capsule system and you’ll be on 
your own air tanks. You got two 
hours of air in the capsule and 
pother hour in your tanks. Okay, 
I’m closin’ you in. Bon voyage.” 

The capsule door closed. They 
watched the inside wheel turn as it 
was dogged shut. It already seemed 
close and cramped in the pod. Like 



a big steel coffin built for two, Ke- 
vin thought. He pushed the thought 
aside. 

“We’re moving,” Ellen said. 

There wasn’t much sense of mo- 
tion, but she was right. The capsule 
was moving along the track. Kevin 
tried to visualize its progress as it 
went inexorably toward the launch 
area. “Wonder how the kids will 
make out?” 

“Better than us, I expect. At least 
we don’t have to do anything — ” 

“I wish we did,” Kevin said. 
“Better than just waiting for them.” 

“Sure—” 

The warning tones sounded, then 
gravity seized them. They were 
pressed hard into the seat webbing. 

Three gravities isn’t all that bad; 
a little like being on a water bed 
with another mattress on top of you 
and two people piled onto that. It 
was possible to breathe, but not to 
talk. The acceleration went on and 
on. 

I’m really going, Kevin thought. 
I’ve left Earth, and 1 won’t be back 
for a long time. 

★ ★ ★ 

Eventually the weight diminished, 
then was gone entirely. There was a 
sensation of falling, endless falling. 

“I wonder if we made it,” Ellen 
said. Her voice was artificially 
calm. 

“Well, this is free fall—” 

“Which we would feel whether 
or not we have enough velocity to 



36 



GALAXY 





EXILES TO GLORY 



37 





make orbit,” Ellen said. “And we 
won’t know for about half an 
hour.” 

“By then the crew people will be 
here.” I hope, Kevin thought. 

There was nothing to do. There 
ought to be some kind of instniment 
to tell them they were in orbit. Ke- 
vin thought about that. How could 
you design one? No air, of course; 
couldn’t measure velocity by air 
speed. An accelerometer hooked 
into the capsule; add up all the ac- 
celerations and you’d have velocity. 
A micro-computer to decide whether 
that was the proper velocity for the 
job. Sure, it could be 'done. Why 
hadn’t they done it? Another ex- 
pense for an already expensive busi- 
ness. 

“I’d think someone would have 
spoken to us by now,” Ellen said. 
She moved her arm up so that she 
could see her watch. “Only five 
minutes. Seems longer.” 

“Sure does. Uh — by the way, my 
name is Kevin.” 

“I know. I saw it on your paper. 
In the chamber. You read mine, 
too. We were pretty silly, weren’t 
we?” 

“Yeah. What outfit are you 
with?” 

“None. I’m paying my own 
way,” she said. 

Good Lord. She had to be fabu- 
lously wealthy. He looked at her suit 
and other gear. First class, but no 
frills. 

“How come you’re taking the 
hard way up instead of the shuttle?” 

38 



“I couldn’t afford a shuttle tic- 
ket.” 

That didn’t make sense. “But you 
can afford a ticket to Ceres. Why 
are you going there?” 

“It seemed like a good idea at the 
time,” she said. Then she giggled. 
“I’m not too bad at engineering, 
Kevin, even if you don’t approve of 
women in your business — ” 

“I never said — ” 

“And I didn't like the offers I got 
from the orbital factories. Or the 
Luna companies either. So I took 
what I could scrape up and bought a 
ticket. There wasn’t much to 
spare.” 

“Out to make your fortune 
pioneering,” Kevin said. 

“That’s right. There’ll be good 
Jobs for me. For anyone who can do 
the work. I see you don’t approve.” 

“Sure I approve. It Just seems 
like a long way to go — ” 

“You’re going,” she pointed out. 
“Why can’t I?” 

Kevin didn’t answer. It Just didn’t 
seem right. And you’re a male 
chauvinist pig, he told himself. You 
hate to see a pretty girl working at 
something besides being a pretty 
girl. 

Only that’s not true. Dammit it’s 
going to be rough out there, and — 

And, he thought, I've got about 
three million years of evolution that 
says women and children shouldn’t 
get into tough situations. The world 
is no longer a place where we live in 
caves and go hunt tigers, and our 
instincts are all fouled up, but we We 



GALAXY 




got them. 

Of course it was pretty rough for 
unmarried women in the United 
States anyway. The feminist move- 
ment had gotten legal equality for 
women — for a while. But then came 
the Equity scandals, and the Great 
Recession, and rising unemploy- 
ment. 

The unions put on the pressure, 
and Congress came up with the 
‘One Job Per Family* law. The 
courts threw it out, but Congress 
passed it again, and its status was 
still undecided. And women weren’t 
welcome in most unions whatever 
the courts said, not with so many 
men out of work. 

And maybe, Kevin thought, 
maybe the whole idea is wrong, but 
there are plenty of women — married 
women — who approve the job re- 
strictions and reserved occupations. 

“It seemed a long time from 
when they launched the cargo to 
when they sent us up,” Kevin said. 
“How can both batches get to the 
same satellite?” 

“They can’t. The cargo went di- 
rectly to Wayfarer. We go to the 
orbital station,” Ellen said. She 
frowned. “I make it twenty minutes 
since we were launched. Doesn’t 
that seem like an excessively long 
time? We ought to have heard from 
someone.” 

“It does seem a while. Let’s try 
calling out.” He reached up to the 
radio panel above. There was a 
small card of instruction attached 
on its face. The first said, “for 



EMERGENCY USE ONLY” in five lan- 
guages. “Is this an emergency?” 

Ellen looked thoughtful. “I don’t 
know — I’d hate to cause trouble, but 
I am getting a bit worried.” 

“Me too. To hell with them.” He 
switched on the radio. Then he 
cursed. “There’s no pilot light,” he 
said. “Burned out — or does the set 
work?” There was only one way to 
find out. There was a jack on the 
face of the panel, and he plugged 
his mike into it. “Hey out there 
— anybody listening? This is Cap- 
sule — uh — nine-eight-four, hopefully 
in orbit. Anyone? Over.” 

“There isn’t even static,” Ellen 
said. “The receiver’s not working. I 
doubt if the transmitter is working 
either.” 

Kevin looked at her with curious- 
ity. She didn’t seem scared. Or sur- 
prised, either. “What do we do?” 

“You can try the transmitter 
again.” 

“Sure. Mayday. Mayday. This is 
Capsule nine-eight-four. Mayday, 
Mayday. Over.” Again he heard 
nothing. How long would it take for 
one of the crewmen to get to them, 
if the transmitter worked but the re- 
ceiver didn’t? “Mayday, Mayday, 
Mayday. This is Capsule nine- 
eight-four. Our receiver is not 
working. We cannot hear your re- 
ply. Please come help us. May- 
day.” 

Ellen began unfastening her seat 
straps. Kevin watched with a frown. 
Thev’d been told not to do that. Of 
course they’d also been told some- 



EXILES TO GLORY 



39 




one would come get them. He felt a 
knot of fear in his stomach. Trapped 
in an orbiting steel coffin. The sen- 
sation of falling was overwhelming 
now. In a moment he’d panic if he 
couldn’t do something constructive. 
But what? “MAYDAY. MAYDAY. 
SOMEBODY COME HELP US! ” 

“I don’t think that’s going to do 
much good,” Ellen said. She in- 
spected the emergency set. “I don’t 
see anything obviously wrong. 
Should we take the cover off and 
look?” 

Kevin doubted that would be any 
use. Integrated circuit chips all look 
alike; how could you tell if some- 
thing was wrong with one of them? 
He began unfastening his own 
straps. When they were loose, he 
floated away from the acceleration 
couch. It was a strange sensation. 
He’d seen people in free fall on TV 
often enough, and had looked for- 
ward to experiencing it, to being 
able to swim in the air, but now all 
he wanted was to get back to having 
weight again. 

“We have suit radios,” Ellen 
said. “Is yours powered?” 

“Yes. Fresh batteries, and it was 
checked out yesterday — Hey! If we 
get outside this thing, we might be 
able to raise somebody with it.” 
“We’ll have to disconnect from 
the capsule air supply before we can 
open the hatch,” Ellen said. “If the 
hatch will open at all — ” 

“Why shouldn’t it?” 

She shrugged. The motion set her 
twisting slightly, and she caromed 

40 



into him in the confined space. 
They both grabbed handholds. 

“We have to do something,” 
Kevin said. “Let’s open the hatch.” 
He reached for the big emergency 
disconnect handle. 

“Wait. Fasten your safety line to 
something.” 

“Oh. Right.” He clipped the line 
to one of the couch pipeframes. 
“Ready?” 

“As I’ll ever be. Go ahead.” 

He turned the red handle. It 
didn't turn; he did. Kevin cursed 
and got his feet planted against the 
couch, braced, and turned the 
handle again. It moved, slowly at 
first, then swung over. The ship’s 
air hoses popped loose from their 
connections on their backpacks. 
They were now living on their air 
tanks. 

“There’s still pressure in here,” 
Ellen said. 

“Damn.” She was right. The 
emergency disconnect was supposed 
to vent all the air from the capsule. 
The capsule hatch wouldn’t open 
until the air was gone. There ’d be 
no point in pulling on it; at seven 
pounds a square inch, hundreds of 
tons of air pressure held that hatch 
closed. 

They couldn’t open the hatch, and 
then had less than an hour of air. 



VI 

“I never thought they’d do it this 
way,” Ellen said. 



GALAXY 




“Huh? Who’d do what this 
way?” Kevin asked. 

“Nothing. We’ve got to bleed the 
pressure out of this capsule. Try to 
find the relief valve.” She began 
searching her side of the capsule. 

“This looks like it,” Kevin said. 
There was a valve with a large han- 
dle. Remembering what happened 
the last time he’d tried to turn 
something in free fall, he braced 
himself before he twisted the 
handle. 

It spun without effort. The handle 
wasn’t splined to the valve stem. 
‘Jesus Christ,” he muttered. Ellen 
pulled herself over to watch as he 
futilely turned the handle. “No 
go,” he announced. He was sur- 
prised at how calm he sounded. 

“Your tool kit,” Ellen said. 
“What’s in it?” 

Kevin didn’t really know. He’d 
taken some of the items out to look 
them over, but that was something 
else he was supposed to learn about 
on the way out to the Belt, and 
there ’d been so little time to pre- 
pare. He took the leather tool pack 
off his belt and opened it. 

“There’s a power head,” he said. 
“I remember that. And drill bits. 
But is it enough to get through the 
capsule walls?” 

“You won’t know until you try,” 
Ellen said. 

He took out the power head and 
inspected it. Then he searched 
through the loops of the tool pack 
until he found the drill chuck. It 
wasn’t obvious how that attached to 



the power unit, but he worked 
carefully to be sure he didn’t bend 
or break anything, and eventually it 
snapped into place. He pulled the 
trigger experimentally. The whine of 
the motor was delightful music. 

“Now for the bit. About six mil- 
limeters? Looks about right.” He 
squinted in the dim capsule light, 
trying to read the tiny words on the 
shank of the bit. He couldn’t make 
them out. He hoped all the bits were 
intended for drilling metal. At least 
they were sharp and new. 

He put the bit in the chuck and 
tightened it, then looked for a place 
to drill, choosing a spot between 
two braces. “I wonder how thick 
these things are.” 

“No thicker than they have to 
be,” Ellen said. 

“True.” The less structural 
weight, the more payload. “Here 
goes.” He pressed the bit against 
the metal surface and turned on the 
drill. It whirred reassuringly, and 
the bit threw up tiny bright chips 
that floated in the compartment, 
dancing about when stirred by air 
currents kicked up by Kevin’s 
movements. 

“It’s working,” Ellen said. For 
the first time there was excitement 
in her voice. “It really is.” 

He continued to drill, trying not 
to think about why he was drilling 
and where he was. That was no 
good, so he tried to think about 
something else. Why was Ellen so 
calm? And why hadn’t she been 
surprised?

The bit seemed to have gone 
awfully deep. Wouldn’t it ever get 
through? But, even as he wondered, 
it jerked and pushed all the way to 
the chuck. Air whistled out past it. 
Kevin reversed the drill and with- 
drew it. 

“Might take a long time to empty 
the capsule through that hole,” Ke- 
vin said. “I’ll do another hole, this 
time with a larger bit.’’ 

The second hole seemed to go 
easier. Now they could definitely 
feel the pressure dropping. He felt 
the familiar push of the neck seal as 
his air tanks pressurized his helmet 
in compensation. Then he glanced at 
his watch. 

Fifteen minutes. They’d used a 
quarter of their air time in drilling 
the holes, and there was nothing 
they could do but wait. 

★ ★ ★ 

“I have it,’’ Ellen said. She 
turned the steel dogging wheel on 
the hatch. It seemed to turn easily, 
and the hatch opened inward. 

Sunlight poured into the capsule. 
Kevin wondered how long that 
would last. They had to be in orbit, 
a very low orbit at that; it wouldn’t 
be long before they were on Earth’s 
night side. After making sure his 
safety line was still attached he slip- 
ped the pawl on the reel and worked 
his way out of the capsule. The 
sight was so glorious that for a mo- 
ment he didn’t move. 

Earth was below, an enormous 



disc shrouded in wispy white 
clouds. They were above the Atlan- 
tic, and could see islands, and far at 
the horizon the west coast of Africa. 
It looked rather like an enormous 
circular map — they weren’t high 
enough to see Earth as a sphere. 

All around him — there was no 
“above’’ or “below” — there were 
capsules very close by. In the dis- 
tance he saw what seemed to be a 
much larger structure that looked 
like a floating junk pile, without 
shape or form: a series of wheels 
and cylinders and shapes of no de- 
scription at all held together by gir- 
ders and cables. It had bright flash- 
ing lights. Kevin estimated it at 
about a mile away, although he 
found it was very hard to judge either 
its size or distance. 

One of the channels of his suit 
radio was marked in red letters, for 
emergencies. Kevin turned to it, 
tongued the mike. “Mayday. May- 
day, Mayday, this is Cap- 
sule — dammit!” 

Ellen came beside him and put 
her helmet next to his. “Nine-eight- 
four.” 

“Mayday. This is Capsule 
nine-eight-four. Mayday! Dammit, 
where are you?” 

“Maybe they aren’t listening,” 
Ellen said. 

Her voice was the only thing he 
heard in his phones, and given that 
she was right next to him it didn’t 
sound ver>' loud at all; Kevin won- 
dered if the batteries in his set were 
getting weak. But they couldn’t be!

GALAXY 




They were new, the whole rig was 
new. 

“Kevin, look! This is the only 
personnel capsule in this area. The 
others are all cargo.” 

She was right. There were plenty 
of capsules around, some only a few 
yards away, but the others were 
stubbier than theirs, and in contrast 
to the red-white checkerboard pat- 
tern on their own pod, these were 
yellow. Somehow they’d been 
launched into the cargo-pod recov- 
ei 7 area. “Where are the others 
who came up with us?” Kevin de- 
manded. 

“Probably on the other side of 
the base station,” Ellen said. 
“Where the crewmen are. No one 
will come over here until they have 
all the other passengers inside.” 

“But they damned well ought to 
know they’re one pod and two 
people short,” Kevin said angrily. 
“Now what? Mayday, dammit.” 
They were conversing on the 
emergency channel. They shouldn’t 
be doing that. Kevin laughed. 

“What?” 

“Hoping some communications 
monitor overhears us and comes out 
to slap us with a violation ticket.” 
The joke seemed a little flat. He 
glanced at his watch. A little over 
half an hour of air. This was ab- 
surd! They were no more than a 
mile from the station — well, maybe 
two, Kevin thought; distances were 
hard to judge — and there wasn’t any 
way they could get over there. 
Neither of them had a reaction pistol 



or a backpack jet. You can i swim 
in space: no air — nothing to push 
against! Kevin thought, sternly 
repressing an impulse to laugh 
hysterically. So what do we do? 
Have to do something! 

“There are a lot of those capsules 
around here,” Ellen said. “They 
seem to get pretty close to the sta- 
tion — ” 

Yes! Certainly they could get 
closer to the station. The nearest 
capsule in the right direction wasn’t 
more than fifty meters off, possibly 
closer. It should be easy to jump 
that in free fall. 

But if they missed, they’d drift 
forever. 

He looked down at the reel on his 
safety line. Ninety meters. More 
than enough. “Look,” he said 
“I’m going to stay hooked on here 
and jump for that other capsule. If 1 
hit, connect yourself to my line and 
I'll puli you over. Then we’ll see 
about going on to the next one.” He 
released the brake on his safety line 
reel. 

She looked thoughtful for a mo- 
ment, then nodded. “All right.” 

Kevin braced himself for the 
jump. No danger, not really. If he 
missed, she could pull him back. He 
crouched, got a hand-hold on the 
edge of the capsule hatch so he 
could get strain in his legs, and 
jumped. 

He tumbled. Stars whirled above 
him, then Earth, the base station, 
Ellen, then more stars. He must 
have pushed harder with one leg 



EXILES TO GLORY

than the other. He twisted to get a 
look at where he was going. The 
capsule he’d jumped for was a lot 
closer, moving up fast. He twisted 
again, instinctively spreading his 
arms and legs as wide as possible to 
slow his rotation. 

His hand Just brushed the capsule. 
He grabbed frantically and got hold 
of something. It almost yanked his 
arm off. 

Have to remember that, he told 
himself: jump as hard as you can 
and you’ll hit with the same force. 
“Okay, I’m aboard,’’ he said. He 
clipped the other safety line to the 
protruding ring on the capsule. 
“Unsnap my other line and hang 
on — I’ll pull you over.*’ 

“Right,” she said. “Okay, I’m 
ready . ’ ’ 

Kevin pulled gently. The tempta- 
tion was to keep on pulling, but that 
wouldn’t do: she’d just build up 
speed until she was moving too fast, 
maybe fast enough to get hurt. He 
let the line wind back onto its reel. 

She turned just before she reached 
him and landed exactly feet first. 
She seemed pleased with herself 
“Daddy made me study gymnas- 
tics,” she said. “Always hated it, 
but now I’m glad I practiced.” 

“Yeah.” Kevin pointed to 
another capsule, this one only 
twenty -five meters from their pre- 
sent position. “That one’s a piece 
of cake. Here I go.” He jumped, 
this time on center, and checked 
himself against his new perch. 

It took time, but they were able 



to continue the process until they 
were only five hundred meters or so 
from the base. Then they ran out of 
capsules. Kevin prepared himself 
mentally for that final leap, one that 
he knew all too well would probably 
send him past the station, falling 
forever. Better do it now — or 
he might not be able to do it at all. 
But wait — the station seemed 
enormous now; it had been farther 
away than he'd thought. He remem- 
bered that suit radios were delib- 
erately under powered so they 
wouldn’t carry' too far; otherwise all 
of space would be filled with chat- 
ter. But the emergency frequency? 
And they were a lot closer than the 
last time he'd tried. “Hell, it’s 
worth a try. Mayday. Mayday, 
dammit!” 

“Hello Mayday, identify your- 
self” 

“By God!” he shouted. “We 
made it. Hello. We were passengers 
aboard capsule nine-eight-four. Air 
supply is going fast. We're on the 
leading side of the station, among 
the cargo capsules. Don’t know 
which one. We abandoned the per- 
sonnel pod and started hopping from 
cargo-pod to cargo-pod, trying to 
get to the base. I’d say we're about 
half a kilometer out.” 

“Nine-eight-four, can you make a 
light?” the voice asked. “I’ll have a 
scooter out there in a moment. If 
you can show a light it will be 
easier to find you.” 

Kevin waved his flash. Down 
below he could see the sunset line 



44 



GALAXY 




stretching across East Africa. “Bet- 
ter hurry,” he said. “We have 
about ten minutes of air left.” 

“No sweat. Be with you 
shortly.” 

★ ★ ★ 

“But how did it happen?” Kevin 
demanded. 

The crewman shrugged. “1 really 
don’t know. There must have been a 
monumental foul-up down at ground 
control. Never happened before.” 

Foul-up at ground control. Sure, 
he thought. But why wasn’t the 
capsule radio working? Or the 
emergency disconnect? Or even the 
manual pressure-bleed? It seemed 
like a lot of coincidences. It seemed 
like somebody was trying to kill 
him. 

But that, he was sure, was silly. 
He couldn’t think of anyone else 
who’d give a damn if he lived or 
died — and the Green Fence gang 
sure as hell couldn’t reach out into 
space. 

“I would appreciate it if you’d 
look into it,” Ellen said. She 
seemed very calm. A lot calmer 
than Kevin was. 

“Sure,” the crewman said. 
“Luckily, no harm done. We’ve 
just time to send someone out for 
your gear and get you aboard the 
scooter for Wayfarer. Come this 
way, please.” 

“But—” 

“Kevin,” Ellen said. “If we 
raise a fuss they’ll have to investi- 



gate. We’ll have to stay here. And 
Wayfarer won’t wait. I didn’t spend 
ten thousand francs for a ticket Just 
to miss the ship.” 

“All right.” He let the crewman 
lead him through the base. They 
were both being damned nonchalant 
about something that had almost 
killed them. Maybe this was the way 
it’s done in space, he thought. It 
doesn’t take much to kill you out 
here so nobody’s impressed with 
close calls. 

The crewman stayed to the outer 
rim. The station rotated to give arti- 
ficial gravity, about forty percent of 
Earth’s. Kevin was surprised to find 
that it was hard to tell Just how 
much gravity he felt. After that time 
in no-weight, any gravity felt good. 

The deck curved up in front and 
behind them, but it always felt 
level. It was a strange experience to 
be walking on a curve. The walls of 
the station seemed to be made of 
some kind of rubberized cloth with 
a metallic thread in it. They didn’t 
feel hard to the touch, not like steel. 

They went through several air- 
locks and came finally to one that 
led outside. The crewman unsnap- 
ped four new air bottles from a 
rack. Kevin started to pul his two 
into his backpack. 

“Suggestion,” the crewman said. 

“Yes?” 

He pointed to an air gauge on the 
rack of bottles. “It’s a good idea 
always to check and see if they’re 
full.” He reached into his own belt 
pouch and came up with a gauge. 



EXILES TO GLORY 



45 




“Me, I don’t even trust the airmas- 
ter’s gauge. Use my own.” 

Kevin found one in his tool kit. 
Just for luck he checked one bottle 
with all three gauges, his own, the 
airmaster’s and the crewman’s. He 
got the same reading each time. El- 
len followed his example. 

“Now you’re thinking. Okay, 
close up helmets and into the air- 
lock.” 

★ ★ ★ 

The “scooter” was no more than 
an open framework with a long line 
of saddles and a rudime"htar}' control 
system at its front. The passengers 
sat astride fuel tanks, and baggage 
was strapped underneath. The other 
passengers for Wayfarer were al- 
ready aboard. Somebody waved at 
Kevin, and he recognized Bill 
Dykes. Ellen and Kevin got the last 
seats aft, the only two left. They 
strapped in, and about then a smal- 
ler scooter came up with the bag- 
gage from their capsule. It was 
lashed aboard, and the pilot hit the 
throttles. 

The motion was very gentle, 
hardly any acceleration at all. The 
view was marvelous. There was 
Earth below, night with brilliant 
points and squares of city lights. 
Everywhere else were stars, count- 
less stars, endless stars, an endless 
fall of stars in the Milky Way, bril- 
liant stars, with bright colors. 

They moved through a clutter of 
space-launch capsules and crewmen 

46 



with lights unloading them. Kevin 
looked at his watch. Ellen, behind 
him, noticed the gesture. By now 
they would have both been dead. 
She nodded at him then pointed to a 
channel on her radio. Kevin 
switched to it and turned on his set. 

“I’ve never been up before,” she 
said. “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” 

“Yes.” They were coming to the 
daylight line on Earth below. It ran 
through the Pacific. Behind them 
were the bright spots that were cities 
crowded with their millions of 
people. Ahead and below was blue 
water, fleecy clouds and a distant 
line that might have been more 
clouds, or maybe California. To the 
north was a tight spiral of clouds. 

“Typhoon,” Ellen said. She 
stared frankly at it. She seemed on 
edge, but the way a tourist is ex- 
cited at seeing new and wondrous 
sights, not afraid. If she can do it, 
so can I, Kevin thought. He was 
more shaken than he cared to admit. 

Then there was more industrial 
activity around them. They were 
moving into full daylight, and Kevin 
was surprised to see how far they’d 
come from the base station in such a 
short time. Up ahead was a mirror 
larger than a football field. It just 
hung there in space. It focussed 
sunlight onto a rock somewhat 
larger than a house. Other big rocks 
nearby anchored what looked like 
big flat metal plates. Something — he 
supposed metal — boiled off the 
target rock and condensed onto the 
plates. 



GALAXY 




After that they saw a cage that 
looked as if it were made of ordi- 
nary chicken \yire. It was big, half a 
kilometer in diameter, and it was 
filled with launching pods, tanks of 
all sizes, rocks, spare scooters, 
what looked like big garbage cans, 
plastic bags — anything that wasn’t 
in use at the moment. It kept things 
from drifting away. 

They went past other marvels, 
and eventually Wayfarer came into 
sight. The scooter pilot pointed it 
out to them. “Your home for a 
while,” he said. 

Their first impression was of a 
bundle of huge cigars. Those were 
the big fuel tanks almost a hundred 
meters long. They were so large that 
they dwarfed the rest of the ship, 
and ran the entire length of midsec- 
tion. Behind the “cigars” was a 
solid ring that held three rocket 
motors. Then at the end of a spine 
as long as the main body of the ship 
was the nuclear reactor and another 
rocket motor. 

This was the real drive. The three 
cihemical rockets were only for 
steering and close maneuvering. 
Wayfarer's power came from her 
atomic pile. The cigar-shaped tanks 
lield hydrogen, which was pumped 
back to the reactor where it was 
heated up and spewed out through 
the rear nozzle. A ring of heavy 
shielding just forward of the reactor 
kept the pile’s radiation from getting 
to the crew compartment. The rest 
of the pile wasn’t shielded at all. 

Despite the large size of the ship, 



the crew and cargo sections seemed 
quite small. There were some 
structures reaching back from the 
forward ring where the control room 
was. Two of those were passenger 
quarters. The other was another 
nuclear power unit to make elec- 
tricty to run the environmental con- 
trol equipment, furnish light for the 
plants, power to reprocess air, and 
all the other things the ship and pas- 
sengers and crew would need. There 
was a big telescope and a number of 
radar antennae on the forward sec- 
tion. 

The scooter pilot was careful not 
to get near the reactor in the ship’s 
“stinger.” He brought them in to 
the bow. The outer door of an air- 
lock stood invitingly open. A crew- 
man brought a cable over and at- 
tached it to the scooter, and then 
hauled the scooter in close. Then 
the passengers began the trip from 
their saddles into the airlock, 
crawling across the cable like so 
many spiders. 

When it came his turn Kevin 
judged the distance and decided to 
jump. He had just crouched when 
the pilot grabbed him. “Hey, no!” 
the pilot shouted. “Not your first 
time in space!” 

Kevin shrugged and grinned into 
his helmet. Probably he’d have to 
take extra-vehicular-activity training 
while on Wayfarer. As if he hadn’t 
learned the hard way how to jump 
around in free fall . 

He crawled across the cable be- 
hind the others.

Home at last, he thought. For 
nine months. A long time. 

VII 

The ship had been designed for 
sixty passengers. She carried twice 
that number plus eight crew. Most 
of the passengers were already 
aboard; Wayfarer was crowded. No 
more than half the passengers had 
ever been into space before, and 
everyone drifted through the ship in 
total confusion. 

The internal space was con- 
structed in a series of circular decks. 
Each deck had an eight-foot hole in 
its center, so that from the forward 
end, just aft of the separately en- 
closed control cabin, Kevin could 
look all the way aft to the stern bulk- 
head. Although there was a long 
and rather flimsy-appearing steel 
ladder stretching from aft to forward 
bulkhead, no one used it. Passen- 
gers and crew dived from deck to 
deck in the null-gravity conditions 
of orbit. Most of the passengers 
weren’t very good at it yet. 

A harried crewman in red 
coveralls punched Kevin’s name 
into a console. “F-12,” he said. 

“If that’s supposed to mean 
something, it doesn’t,” Kevin said. 

“F deck,” the crewman said. “A 
deck is the bridge. B is the ward- 
room. C, D, and E are the three 
aft of that. E happens to be recrea- 
tion and environmental control. 
Yours is the one beyond that. 



They’re marked.” Someone else 
had come up and the crewman 
turned away. “You’ll find it,” he 
said over his shoulder. 

Kevin shrugged. It was a mistake, 
because it caused him to drift away 
from his handhold. He grabbed 
frantically at a protruding handle 
— the ship had plenty of those 
— and when he was stable, 
launched himself down through the 
central well. He got past C and D 
decks before he had to catch some- 
thing and try again. Since he was 
carrying his bulky Fiberglas travel 
case with all his luggage, he felt he 
had a right to be proud of his first 
efforts. 

Finally he reached F deck, which 
he found to be sectioned into 
slice-of-pie compartments arranged 
in a ring around the central well, 
fifteen of them in all. He found the 
one marked “12” and went in. 

His “stateroom” was partitioned 
off with a flexible, bright blue 
material that Kevin thought was 
probably nylon. The door was of the 
same stuff and tied off with strings. 
It didn’t provide much privacy. 

Inside the cramped quarters were 
facilities for two people. There were 
no bunks, but two blanket rolls 
strapped against the bulkhead indi- 
cated the sleeping arrangements. It 
made sense, Kevin thought. You 
didn’t need soft mattresses in space. 
“Sleeping on a cloud” was literally 
true here. You needed straps to keep 
you from drifting away, but that 
was all. 



48 



GALAXY 




One viewscreen with control con- 
sole, a small worktable, and two 
lockers about the size of large brief- 
cases completed the furnishings. 
The cabin wasn’t an encouraging 
sight. Kevin wondered what he 
should do with his gear. His 
Fiberglas travel case was stuffed 
with things he’d been told he’d 
probably need for the trip; another 
larger case had been stowed some- 
where by the crew and was inacces- 
sible. He wandered out into the cen- 
tral area of F deck, and found that 
in other staterooms people were 
lashing their travel cases to the 
bulkheads. Kevin went back and did 
the same. 

He wondered who his cabinmate 
would be. No one had asked him if 
he had any preferences. The only 
person he knew aboard Wayfarer 
was Ellen, and she wasn’t likely to 
accept an offer to share quarters. 
While he was trying to convince 
himself that it couldn’t hurt to ask, 
a middle-aged bearded man, quite 
heavyset, came in carrying two 
large travel cases. He looked up at 
Kevin apologetically. 

“They told me to bunk here,’’ he 
said. He blinked rapidly and looked 
around the small room. “It isn’t 
very large, is it? I’m Jacob Norse- 
dal.” His voice wasn’t very deep to 
begin with, and the low air pressure 
in the ship made it sound squeaky. 

Kevin introduced himself. He 
tried to shake hands with Norsedal, 
but again got separated from his 
handhold and drifted across the ca- 



bin. Norsedal looked thoughtful, 
then, holding a wire conduit that ran 
through their stateroom, reached out 
and very gently pushed against Ke- 
vin. Kevin drifted to the bulkhead 
where he got himself back into con- 
trol. Norsedal looked pleased. 

The incident reminded Kevin that 
he was in free fall, and his stomach 
didn’t like it much. He gulped hard. 
“I’ll be glad when we’re under 
way,’' he said. “It won’t last long, 
but it will be nice to have some 
weight again. Even for a day or 
so.’’ 

Norsedal frowned and rolled his 
eyes upward for a moment. “Not 
that long. I’m afraid,’’ he said. 
“Let’s see, total velocity change of 
about five kilometers a second, at a 
tenth of a gravity acceleration — five 
thousand seconds.’' He took a poc- 
ket computer off his belt and 
punched numbers. “An hour and a 
half. Then we're back in zero-grav- 
ity.’’ He restored the computer to its 
pouch. It was secured to it with a 
short elastic thong, as was every- 
thing else Norsedal carried. 

Kevin was fascinated with the 
man. He went about everything 
methodically. First he strapped 
down his travel cases. Then he 
opened one. A geyser of clothing, 
papers, pencils, another and far 
more elaborate computer than the 
one he wore on his belt, chewing 
gum, bulbs of soft drinks, more 
clothing, a dozen magnetic-strip 
programs for his computer, and 
other small objects floated up into 



EXILES TO GLORY 



49 




the room. They dispersed in the 
compartment. 

“Oh, my," Norsedal said. He 
looked thoughtful. His hand snared 
the computer as it drifted by. Then 
he reached into the travel case again 
and got a shirt. "If you’ll help me 
with this — ’’ 

Together they used the shirt like a 
seine to net all the gear. Norsedal 
produced a laundry bag to hold ev- 
erything. Then he fished around in 
the travel case, more carefully this 
time, until he had a pleased expres- 
sion. He came up with a small ny- 
lon-covered package that contained 
several rolls of Velcro, a pair of 
scissors, and a squeeze-tube of 
quick-drying glue. He began gluing 
Velcro hooks into his travel case 
and his locker. "I should have done 
this back on Earth," he said. His 
voice was almost perpetually 
apologetic. "But it wasn’t certain 
I'd be coming, and they didn’t give 
me the cases until just before I 
left." 

Kevin watched interestedly. When 
the lockers were entirely lined with 
glued-on Velcro hooks, Norsedal 
carefully began work with the fuzzy 
Velcro, attaching strips to all his 
personal gear. Calculator, pencil 
case, notebook, tape recorder — 

"That’s a great idea," Kevin 
said. 

"Want some? I brought plenty." 

"Thanks, yes." Mostly Kevin 
was interested in the other man. He 
didn’t seem like anyone Kevin 
would have thought would go to 



space. Norsedal was clearly over- 
weight, very visibly so. He sniffed 
as if suffering from a sinus condi- 
tion, and one of the objects Kevin 
had caught for him was a kit con- 
taining a hypodermic needle and 
bottles of what must have been 
room-temperature insulin. Although 
it was obvious that Norsedal had 
thought a lot about life in 
zero-gravity conditions and tried to 
make preparations, it was also obvi- 
ous that he’d never been in space 
before. He had trouble keeping him- 
self anchored while he worked. 

"Who’re you with?" Kevin 
asked. He had to talk much louder 
than he was used to; the low air 
pressure didn’t carry sound very 
well. Although there were people in 
the compartments on either side and 
the partition was only thin nylon, 
they couldn’t understand the conver- 
sations in the next cabins. 

"Interplanet. ’’ Norsedal con- 
tinued working with glue and Vel- 
cro. The glue smell was strong, but 
not excessively so. "I hope the air 
system doesn’t have trouble with 
this," Norsedal said. "I suppose I 
should have brought water-soluble 
glue. But I wanted it to dry quickly. 
Maybe we should ask someone — ’’ 

"I wouldn’t worry about it," Ke- 
vin said. Interplanet, he thought. 
That was the Zurich-based interna- 
tional consortium that maintained 
one of the two bases on Ceres. Ke- 
vin couldn’t picture Jacob Norsedal 
as a miner or prospector and he 
certainly wasn’t any kind of con- 



50 



GALAXY 




struction worker. “What will you be 
doing on Ceres?” 

“Computer programming. And 
cxp>eriments with the computer sys- 
tem,” Norsedal said. “Storekeep- 
ing — I’m supposed to set up an 
inventory control system for 
them. And work time-effectiveness 
studies. Anything that needs doing 
with computers.” He seemed very 
happy about the idea. 

“I — ” Kevin hesitated. He didn’t 
want to offend the man. Presumably 
there would be an opportunity to 
swap cabinmates once the ship was 
under way, but in any event there 
was certainly no sense in getting 
into an argument with someone 
you’d have to live with for months. 
His curiosity got the better of him. 
‘‘You don’t seem like a spaceman ” 

Norsedal smiled through his 
beard. “No. That’s what the com- 
pany said when I applied. It took 
me a long time to convince them. 
But look at it this wav. A ten-vear 
supply of insulin doesn’t weigh very 
much. Nor does it matter if I’m 
overweight, not in Ceres’ gravity, or 
in none at all. And I had one very 
good argument: I wanted to go and I 
can do the work.” He began stow- 
ing his gear as he glued fuzz onto 
it. Decks of magnetic-backed cards. 
Three wargaming books. When he 
came to 4hose he looked thought- 
fully at the reader screen. 

“I think I can tie that into my 
computer,” Norsedal said. “We can 
use it for a display. Are you in- 
terested in wargames?” 



Kevin had never thought about it. 
“After a few months in space I ex- 
pect I’ll be interested in any- 
thing—” 

Norsedal grinned. “That’s what I 
thought. We’ll teach this thing to 
play Star Trek.” He reached out to 
the screen and touched it, petting it 
like a dog: nice screen. Pat, pat. 

★ ★ ★ 

They had two days aboard Way- 
farer before the final boost toward 
Ceres. Kevin thought it would have 
been fun if there hadn’t been so 
many people crowded aboard. He 
learned to eat in free fall, although 
he still managed to get a lot of the 
food into the intake grid of the air 
recirculation system: the only way 
to spoon food from plastic bags to 
mouth was in one smooth motion, 
never stopping. If he halted the 
spoon on its way, the food kept 
going to splatter against his face or 
shoot over his shoulder. 

He also learned to do tumbling in 
zero-gravity. One of the other pas- 
sengers organized a pool: the winner 
would be the first passenger to go in 
a single leap from A deck all the 
way to the aft bulkhead. No one 
looked like winning it just yet; four 
decks was the record. It was Ke- 
vin’s turn to try when Captain 
Greiner ordered all the passengers 
back to their cabins for boost. 

Weight felt strange. The ship 
boosted at about ten percent of 
Earth’s gravity, but Kevin found 



EXILES TO GLORY 



51 




that quite enough. All over the ship 
loosed objects fell to the decks. 

“Last chance,” Jacob Norsedal 
said. “Until halfway there. Any- 
thing lost after this boost is done 
will either go to the air intake grid, 
or it won’t show up at all.” 

Ninety minutes later the accelera- 
tion ended. Wayfarer was now in a 
long elliptical orbit that would cross 
the orbit of Ceres. Left to itself, the 
ship would go on past, more than 
halfway to Jupiter, before the Sun’s 
gravity would finally turn it back to 
complete the ellipse and return it to 
its starting point. In order to land 
on Ceres, the ship would have to 
boost again when it got out to the 
orbit of the asteroid. 

There would also be minor 
course-correction maneuvers during 
the trip, but except for those the 
ship’s nuclear-pile engine wouldn’t 
be started up until they arrived at 
Ceres’s orbit. Then the ship would 
accelerate to catch up with the as- 
teroid. That wouldn’t happen for 
nine months. 

Nine months was a long time 
Kevin had thought, but he was sur- 
prised at how quickly time passed. 
With only ten crewmen aboard, the 
passengers had to take turns work- 
ing ship maintenance systems. Ke- 
vin was assigned to life support, 
with the job of cleaning out the 
sewage-processor. It wasn’t his 
favorite work, but he learned a lot 
about the algae tanks and chemical 
processors that took human wastes, 
including exhaled carbon dioxide, 



and turned them into oxygen and 
food. 

There were also large leafy 
plants: lettuce, spinach, even 

watermelons and pumpkins. These 
vegetables furnished variety in their 
food, but were not really important 
to the ship’s ecology. It takes a lot 
of surface area to absorb sunlight 
enough to convert a hundred 
people’s wastes, and the larger the 
plants the less surface they had for 
the mass they took up. Algae are 
not as pretty as strawberry plants, 
but they are highly efficient. 

The heart of the system was a 
series of large transparent tanks fil- 
led with green water and tropical 
fish. Once Wayfarer was under way 
the crew erected large mirrors out- 
side the hull. The mirrors collected 
sunlight and focussed it through 
plexi-glass viewports onto the algae 
tanks. A ventilation system brought 
the ship's air into the tanks as a 
stream of bubbles. Other pumping 
systems collected sewage and forced 
it into chemical processors; the out- 
put was treated sewage that went to 
the algae tanks as fertilizer. 

Kevin called it the “green slime 
works” and was always suspicious 
of the food served aboard Wayfarer; 
harvesting and food processing was 
somebody else’s job, and Kevin 
didn’t want to know the details. He 
knew that the algae became high- 
protein flour somehwere along the 
line — but he also knew what the 
algae tanks took in. The thought 
wasn’t particularly appetizing. 



52 



GALAXY 




He got to know most of his fel- 
low passengers. Ellen was roomed 
with two other women in a slightly 
larger cabin on L Deck, not far 
from the stern. Wiley Ralston was 
one deck above her. So was Bill 
Dykes, the miner/prospector Kevin 
had met on the plane to Baja. Kevin 
met a number of others as well; he 
had a very popular roommate. 

Jacob Norsedal was madly teach- 
ing his personal computer to play 
Star Trek, Galactic Empire, Water- 
loo, Alexander the Great, Diplo- 
macy, and any other game people 
wanted to indulge in. He had also 
invented a three-dimensional in- 
terstellar war game with a dozen 
mutually opposing sides and that 
seemed destined to be intermina- 
ble — the players needed a computer 
just to tell them their options. Nor- 
sedal didn’t play games himself, but 
he loved being referee, and his 
quarters tended to be a meet- 
ing place for those with nothing to 
do. 

Kevin, to his sorrow', wasn’t in- 
cluded in that category. On his sec- 
ond day after boost a large man 
came to the stateroom. “Kevin 
Senecal?” he demanded. 

“Me,” Kevin admitted. 

“George Lange. Senior Daedalus 
employee aboard. I guess I’m your 
boss.’’ Lange held out a stack of 
casettes. “You’re supposed to study 
these.’’ 

Kevin eyed them warily. “That’s 
a lot of reading — ’’ 

“It’s just a start,’’ Lange said. 



“I’ve got a lot more for you. 
You’re expected to learn something 
on this trip.’’ He glared at Norse- 
dal’s computer, which was marching 
armies across the reader screen. 
“There’s work waiting out in the 
Belt.’’ 

“And we’ve got months,'' Wiley 
Ralston said. He came into the 
stateroom. With four people inside 
it was crowded, but not badly: 
Ralston and Norsedal took places 
near where the ceiling would have 
been if there had been a floor and 
celling; with no gravity, there was 
no up or down and any part of the 
room was as comfortable as any 
other. 

“There’s months' worth of 
learning to be done,’’ Lange 
growled. “Look, this ship is it. 
Either we make some profits out of 
the Belt, or there won’t be more 
ships going. Not even the big com- 
panies can keep up this investment 
without some return. So at least 
you, Senecal. will get to work 
learning what you ought to — ’’ 

Later Kevin found he had tapes 
on general space operations, mining, 
prospecting, environmental control 
systems, composition of asteroids, 
orbital mechanics — 

Norsedal helped him study. He 
claimed to be interested, but Kevin 
thought Norsedal had probably 
learned everything on the tapes and 
was too polite to admit it. Certainly 
he was a good coach. Anything that 
could be done with a computer par- 
ticularly interested him, and he 



EXILES TO GLORS 



53 




showed Kevin how to do simple 
programs to solve most of the 
problems on the tapes. Slowly 
Kevin found himself learning what 
he had to know, even though it left 
him very little time for social life. 
His studies tended to keep him 
busy, so that he conversed mainly 
with Norsedal. 

Three weeks out Kevin finished 
the first stack of tapes. ‘T suppose 
he'll have more,” he said. 

Norsedal was sitting yoga-fashion 
on nothing. He looked like a 
bearded Buddha. ‘‘Probably.” 

‘‘So I don’t tell him I’m done,” 
Kevin said. He waved at the stack 
of tapes. “Gripes, according to that 
stuff we’ve licked all the problems, 
but every time I see Lange he gives 
me this bit about how desperate ev- 
erything is, and how much work 
there is to do — ” He stopped be- 
cause Norsedal wasn’t amused and 
it showed. “Are things that bad? 1 
thought we knew how to live in 
space — " 

“We do,” Jacob said. “Techni- 
cal capabilities exceed requirements 
by an order of magnitude. But 
Lange is right all the same. The 
space colonies aren’t self-sufficient, 
and there aren’t many ships. The 
Luna people want more Earth car- 
goes, the O’Neill Colony people 
want the ships, and the big com- 
panies can’t afford to keep sending 
ships out to the Belt unless they get 
something back. I wouldn’t be sur- 
prised if this were the last ship from 
Earth until the Ceres refineries 



prove they can make a profit." 

“You mean it’s really up to us?” 
Kevin asked. 

Norsedal was very serious. “It 
might be. It’s worse than that, re- 
ally. Earth is so near the edge that if 
this attempt doesn’t make it we may 
never be able to afford asteroid col- 
onies again.’* 

It was a sobering thought. Kevin 
looked at the pile of tapes. “I guess 
I’d better tell Lange I’m ready to 
get back to work.” 

VIII 

With 130 people packed into 
quarters that would have been 
cramped for half that number it was 
inevitable that the passengers would 
get on each other’s nerves. Kevin 
was surprised at just how few fights 
developed. There were plenty of 
quarrels and screaming matches, but 
not many blows. The worst part of 
it was the almost complete lack of 
privacy aboard Wayfarer. 

For the first weeks this was no 
great problem for Kevin: there was 
too much to do. He had tapes to 
study, Norsedal 's wargames, extra- 
vehicular activity practice under 
supervision of the crew, mainte- 
nance duties and other ship’s work 
that was rotated among the passen- 
gers — and just plain getting used 
to living in zero-gravity. 

He spent hours playing with 
liquids: squirt a dollop of colored 
water from a syringe, and it im- 



54 



GALAXY 




mediately became a sphere like a 
miniature planet. Inject an air bubble 
into it with a syringe and it assumed 
a new shape. Blow on it gently to 
get it rotating and it became a donut 
of water hanging in space. 

There were rivers of stars to see 
outside any viewport. He had to 
learn the constellations all over 
again; there were just too many stars 
to let him recognize the old familiar 
patterns as seen from Earth, so 
many stars that in a darkened room 
you could almost read by starlight. 
But during EVA practice, perched 
above the ship’s telescope tower 
with nothing ahead or above, he felt 
as if he were suspended motionless 
in space, a part of the universe. Ke- 
vin was always sad when his time 
was up and another passenger took 
his place. He eagerly looked for- 
ward to his practice sessions outside 
the ship, and wondered whether, 
when he reached the Belt and he 
would be outside for many hours at 
a time, he would ever get used to 
the wonder and grandeur of space. 
He hoped he would not. 

As weeks went by, though, he 
found the lack of privacy becoming 
more irritating. There were 30 wo- 
men among the 1 20 passengers 
aboard Wayfarer. Half of those were 
married and most of the remainder 
had formed quasi-permanent attach- 
ments. None of this bothered Kevin, 
since Ellen MacMillan remained at 
large and seemed to enjoy his com- 
pany; but he could never be alone 
with her, and that was annoying. 



Eventually the problem solved it- 
self: they were assigned to environ- 
ment systems maintenance during 
the same shift. Dismantling and 
cleaning sewer pipes wasn’t his idea 
of a romantic setting, but it did have 
the advantage that no one else was 
interested in being in the same com- 
partment while they worked. And 
Felipe Camel, the ship’s Chief En- 
gineer, was happy enough to leave 
the work to qualified passengers 
once he’d checked them out; and 
Ellen was as competent and con- 
scientious as he. 

The work was not demanding, 
merely messy and difficult; they had 
plenty of time to talk. For some 
reason Ellen seemed genuinely in- 
terested in Kevin and kept drawing 
him out. She was easy to talk to, 
and he found himself telling her 
about his early life, abut school, 
and why he had come to space. Al- 
though he was usually somewhat 
shy with girls it was easy to be 
friends with Ellen. 

“1 think I’ve told you everything 
there is to know about me,” he said 
finally. “And I don't know anything 
about you. You never talk about 
yourself — ” 

“Nothing to talk about.” She 
squinted up at him and made a face. 
During the week they’d worked to- 
gether they’d developed a system of 
signals. This one meant that she had 
sweat in her eyes and filth on her 
hands. 

Kevin took a clean tissue and 
wiped her face. “Thanks.” She 



EXILES TO GLORY 



55 




went back to reaming out the plastic 
pipe. 

“Come on,” Kevin said. “You’ve 
made me do all the talking.” 

“There really isn’t anything to 
tell,” Ellen said. “I don’t have any 
relatives. I was raised in an orphan- 
age—’ ’ 

“I didn't think they still had 
those,” Kevin said. “Foster parents 
and — ” 

Ellen shuddered. “I was through 
several of those foster homes. Hor- 
rible way to live. Kevin, did you 
ever hear of the Futurian Founda- 
tion?” 

“No.” 

“I guess not too many have. It’s 
an organization that’s interested in 
where — ” She laughed. “It sounds 
silly if you’re not a part of it.” 

“No, please. Tell me.” 

“Well, we’re trying to look at 
where mankind is going,” Ellen 
said defiantly. “Governments look 
ahead as far as the next election. 
The big corporations can look a lit- 
tle farther, sometimes as far as ten 
years. And nobody worries about 
what’s going to happen after that. 
Nobody except us. We try to look 
hundreds, even thousands of years 
ahead.” 

“And you’re a member of 
that—” 

“Sort of. They raised me. When 
I was fifteen they bought me from 
the foster parents I was with — ’ ’ 

“Bought you? Sounds like slav- 
ery.” 

She shrugged, a tiny wriggling 



motion; they had all learned new 
gestures for use in zero-gravity. She 
shifted her location, wedging one 
foot under a pipe clamp so that she 
could use both hands for the job she 
was doing. 

“In a way it is,” she said, “The 
state pays the foster parents to raise 
orphans. It’s profitable work. 
They’re paid by the number of kids 
in their home, so the foster parents 
don’t want to let anyone go. The 
social welfare people don’t want to 
let you go either — if they don’t 
have orphans to take care of, they 
can’t justify their jobs. So the Futu- 
rians had to pay off the foster par- 
ents, some lawyers, and two social 
workers. I’m glad they did.” 

Kevin looked puzzled. Ellen 
laughed. “Nothing mysterious about 
it. They have a testing program to 
catch the right people young and get 
them thinking about the future in- 
stead of themselves. That’s all there 
is to it. I’ve been brought up to be 
satisfied with enough to live on, not 
to want anything more except my 
work — so I’ve got everything I 
want.” 

“And you think that’s not in- 
teresting?” Kevin said. “You seem 
to have found the secret of the 
ages.” 

She laughed again. It was a 
pleasant sound, even muted as it 
was by the low air pressure. “We 
don’t keep all our recruits, you 
know. Most of the kids we bring up 
go off to normal lives. Only a few 
of us join the Fellowship.” 



56 



GALAXY 




“But you did?” She nodded. “I 
suppose that’s like a priesthood,” 
Kevin said. 

His voice had betrayed his 
thoughts, and she laughed again. 
'‘Not really. We’re not celibate, you 
know! Although sometimes you act 
as if you think I am — ” 

“Hey, wait a minute, that’s not 
fair,” Kevin protested. 

She was laughing again. “The 
way conditions are on this ship we 
both might as well be monks 
— either that or adopt the at- 
titude of monkeys in a zoo, and I’m 
afraid I haven’t got to that point yet. 
There. That’s done. You tighten up 
the connections while I clean up.” 
She looked down at her hands. 
‘‘Yuk.” 

Kevin pushed away from the bulk- 
head and expertly floated over to 
the pipe assembly. He was proud of 
his hard-won ability to work in null- 
gravity conditions. He got one foot 
wedged into the pipe retainer and 
braced the other against a wire 
channel, leaving both hands free, 
and applied a big wrench to the 
pipes. The fittings turned hard, and 
everything took at least twice as 
long to do in zero-gravity as it 
would have on Earth. Finally he had 
it done. “You can turn on the pres- 
sure.” 

The system worked again, with 
no leaks, and Kevin nodded in 
satisfaction. 

“Now. We’re alone, and this is 
done, and — ” He reached for her. 
She didn’t resist.

“I think we’d better stop,” she 
said, after a while. 

“Why?” 

“Because this isn’t a very private 
place, and I am not a monkey in a 
zoo. The Leones may not mind 
putting on demonstrations for the 
other passengers, but I do — ” 
“Nobody ever comes here.” 

“Yes they do.” She pushed away 
from him and caught a look at her 
reflection in one of the big plexi- 
glass algae tanks. ‘T’m a mess. 



“You're not." 

“Thank you. But I am. So are 
you, for that matter. Our faces are 
all swollen up, our lips are chapped, 
and we’re getting pimples.” 

“All true but all irrelevent,'’ Ke- 
vin said. “We knew that would 
happen before we signed up for a 
long trick in zero-gravity.” 

“But 1 didn’t think I’d look this 
awful.” 

“You look all right to me.” He 
did a double somersault from his 
bulkhead and landed just next to 
her. He grinned and reached for her 
again. 

“Kevin, please ...” Finally, she 
pushed away again. “Please. That's 
enough.” 

“Not for me — ” 

“Not for me either, but it’s still 
all we’re going to do,” she said. 
“And don’t look like a hurt little 
boy. Kevin, I like you. That’s just 
the trouble. If we — this wouldn’t be 
just a shipboard romance. Kevin, I 
can’t afford emotional involvements. 



We’ve both got too much to do 
when we get to Ceres.” 

“So we have work to do. There’s 
more to life than work — ” 

“Sometimes. Kevin, once we get 
to Ceres we may never see each 
other again. It’s not fair to either of 
us to — to get too attached to each 
other.” 

“I’ll take my chances.” 

“You say that now because I’m 
the only girl available. You 
wouldn’t if — if you knew what 
you'd be getting into. I’m not 
somebody you ought to know, Ke- 
vin. I shouldn’t have teased you. 
I’m sorry. 1 get lonely too, and I 
forgot that we’ll never just be two 
people — ” 

“What?” Kevin frowned. There 
was a strange expression on Ellen’s 
face, a strange look in her eyes, and 
he didn’t understand. 

“There’s so much you can’t 
know,” Ellen said. “Kevin, we’re 
friends. Let’s leave it at that.” She 
turned away to stare at pressure and 
flow gauges. “I think we’ve got this 
working again, and I’ve got some 
writing to do.” She left the com- 
partment hurriedly. 

Kevin wanted to follow her, but 
she moved too quickly, and there 
were people in the corridors outside. 
He came back to stare into the algae 
tanks. 

Tropical fish swam through the 
thick plant growth. They had ad- 
justed to lack of gravity and 
oriented themselves as if the light 
source were *‘up." They no longer 



58 



GALAXY 




seemed confused — but Kevin was, 
and he didn’t like it. 

“She said she liked me,” he 
muttered to the fish. “And it’s a 
long way to Ceres.” He could 
comfort himself with that. It was a 
long way to Ceres . 

A week later they were both 
transferred to other ship’s duties, 
not together. Kevin saw her quite 
often, but never alone. 

Kevin’s new assignment was on 
the bridge. His partner was Wiley 
Ralston, and Kevin found himself 
telling his friend about his problems 
with Ellen. 

Ralston laughed. “Persistence, 
old buddy. Persistence and propin- 
quity. Girls aren’t any different 
from guys. They get homy too. 
Give it time.” 

“There doesn’t seem to be a lot 
else to do,” Kevin said. 

“Yeah. Well, you’ll have more 
of ’em to go after when we get to 
the Belt.” 

True enough, Kevin thought. But 
he wasn’t sure that was what he 
wanted. He wasn’t sure what love 
was, or whether he believed in it, 
but he kept wishing Ellen were 
around so he could tell her things 
he’d just thought of, and made 
excuses to go find her. 

Eventually they were back in the 
farms and alone; and this time when 
he kissed her she didn’t run away. 
A long time later, when they could 
speak again, she said, very seri- 
ously, “Kevin, we don’t talk about 
love or the future. We’re together 



while we’re on the ship. Nothing 
permanent; nothing lasts after we 
reach the Belt.” 

“Sure,” he said; but he didn't 
believe her. 

★ ★ ★ 

Kevin and Wiley Ralston had 
been assigned to the bridge again 
when the halfway course correction 
came. Captain Greiner was very 
casual about it. First he slaved the 
computer to the high-gain antenna, 
then took position and velocity 
readings from both Earth and Ceres. 
Finally he pointed the main tele- 
scope to the bright star Vega. 

The ship’s computer digested the 
information for a minute. Then it 
flashed ready lights. 

“And this does it,” Greiner said. 
He threw switches giving control of 
the ship to the computer. 

A recorded voice sounded. “Now 
hear this. Stand by for thirty sec- 
onds of very low gravity. Low 
thrust for thirty seconds, commenc- 
ing in one minute. Fifty-nine. Fifty- 
eight . .” 

“Almost as if the ship didn't 
need me at all,” Captain Greiner 
said. “If it weren’t for the mainte- 
nance, it wouldn’t.” 

“But you can operate without the 
computer, while it can’t work with- 
out you,” Kevin said. 

Greiner laughed. “Not hardly. 
Everything’s got to be too precise. 
If we had plenty of fuel, sure, 1 
could navigate by hand calculations; 



EXILES TO GLORY 



59 




but not the way we’re cutting it.” 

“So even out here the machine 
replaces man,” Wiley Ralston said. 
“Well, the damned machines can’t 
do everything for us. Some things 
still need people. Though I wonder 
just how long — ” 

Kevin looked at him quizzically. 
Wiley grinned. “Just so long as 
they need us a few more years,” 
Ralston said. “Long enough to get 
rich. Then they can run the whole 
damned universe by computer.” 

The countdown ended, and they 
felt weight again. Not very much 
weight, about one percent of Earth’s 
gravity: but it felt strange to have 
a permanent ”up” and “down” 
again. Kevin had found that he 
could orient himself to think of any 
direction “above” his head as “up” 
in zero-gravity: since he was facing 
forward, he suddenly found himself 
lying on his back instead of stand- 
ing. He found later that everyone in 
the ship had had the same problem. 

“Ceres has gravity,” Jacob Nor- 
scdal said after dinner. “Let’s see, 
about forty centimeters a second — 
four percent Earth gravity.” 

“Just enough so you can’t jump 
off,” Ellen said. 

“A lot more than that,” Norsedal 
said. His voice was apologetic but 
firm. He was apologetic for disagree- 
ing; but he was never uncertain 
about his facts. He took his belt cal- 
culator, the small one he always 
carried, and punched in numbers. 
“You couldn’t jump more than 
about 125 feet straight up,” he said. 



“Of course, you’d take a while 
coming down.” Click-click. “Not 
so long, thirteen seconds. Half a 
minute for the round trip, up and 
back down again. Of course I’ve 
left out the mass of your suit and 
tanks. I could run it with those — ” 

“Never mind,” Ellen laughed. 
She, like everyone in the ship, had 
found that if you asked Norsedal a 
question you often learned more 
than you wanted to know. “It’s 
going to take getting used to all 
over again,” she said. “Having 
things fall instead of just drifting 
around the way they do here. And 
Eve gotten used to sleeping in 
zero-era V it V. ” 

^ m/ 

They sat at the entrance to Kevin 
and Jacob’s stateroom. One of the 
inevitable tumbling contests was 
going through the central well of the 
ship. Bill Dykes, the miner Kevin 
had met on the airplane to Baja, 
spun past doing somersaults and 
counting loudly. “Ninety-seven!” 
he announced with a grin as he 
w^ent past. He was still centered in 
the opening, and it looked likely 
that he’d get all the way to the stem 
bulkhead. That was no longer un- 
usual: the contest had been won 
weeks before, and now the passen- 
gers were trying to set a record for 
the number of somersaults before 
touching walls or decks. 

“Damn!” Hal Leone was in Ke- 
vin’s stateroom playing a Stella war- 
game with his wife Jeannine. The 
game used ballistic calculations, and 
Hal had managed to get his ship 



60 



GALAXY 




into an unrecoverable situation: no 
matter what he did, it was going to 
crash into a' star. His wife chuckled. 
What made it embarrassing was that 
Hal was a mathematician and his 
wife a physician — but she always 
won. 

Others gathered on F deck. It was 
almost time for another session of 
Norsedal’s monster twelve-sided 
game, and the players were assembling. 
Someone produced a bottle of vodka 
vacuum-distilled from green slime. 
Despite its evil source it had no un- 
usual taste at all. The bottle passed 
around. There was more activity in 
the well: a twirling contest, men and 
women pirouetting in midair. Then 
Bill Dykes came tumbling back to- 
ward the bow, followed closely by 
his cabinmate and partner, Carl 
Lundgren. They were counting 
loudly. 

“Happy hour,” Ellen said. 

Suddenly another man leaped 
across the opening. He collided 
heavily with Carl Lundgren. 

“Look where you’re going!” 
Lundgren shouted. 

“Shove it,” the other man said. 
Kevin recognized him: Frank Sales, 
a loner with a foul temper. Sales 
was going out to work as a miner. 
He was a short, almost dwarfish 
man, who compensated for his small 
stature with a constant program of 
exercises. All the passengers were 
supposed to take their turn with the 
exercise machines, but Sales was 
the only one who took extra time on 
them as a matter of course. 



“Goddamit, I was headed for a 
record,” Lundgren said. “What’d 
you want to do that for?” 

Sales grunted and turned away. 

“I asked you a question!” 
Lundgren shouted. “Come back 
here.” 

“Hey, buddy,” Bill Dykes said, 
grabbing Lundgren ’s arm, “Drop it. 
He ain’t worth it.” 

Lundgren shook Dykes off. 
“Keep out of this, Bill. That 
sawed-off little bastard never looks 
where he’s going. Who the hell 
does he think he is?” 

“Are you talking about me?” 
Sales grasped a stanchion and turned 
back toward Lundgren. “Are you?” 
“Damn right, you little creep.” 
“Hey — ” Dykes protested, but it 
was too late. Sales dived toward 
Carl Lundgren and knocked him 
from his perch against the edge of F 
Deck. The two men became a tangle 
of arms and legs tumbling in the 
central well. Lundgren caught Sales 
by the hair and pulled; the result 
was that both tumbled out of con- 
trol. 

Others moved to try to separate 
them, but only added to the tangle. 
Someone began to laugh and others 
joined. Ellen giggled. Then Sales's 
hand moved to his tool belt. 

“Look out, Carl, the little bas- 
tard’s got a knife!” Dykes shouted. 

Lundgren turned frantically to- 
ward Sales. One of the others trying 
to separate them grabbed at 
Lundgren, missed, and caused him 
to spin violently again. Three other

passengers dove toward the fighting 
men, and there was another wild 
tangle of bodies. Then bright blood 
spurted out to hang in large droplets 
in the air. It was impossibly red, 
tiny red planets hanging in space. 

Someone screamed, more passen- 
gers and a crewman appeared to 
separate the fighters. When the two 
were pulled apart they saw that Carl 
Lundgren spurted blood in rythmic 
pulses from a slash across his 
throat. 

“You’ve killed my partner!” 
Dykes roared. He started for Sales, 
but other passengers held him. 

“He came for me!” Sales 
shouted. “You saw it, he ran right 
into me, 1 never meant to hurt 
him.” 

There was a babble of voices. 
“Get him to sick bay!” “Hold on 
to that murdering son of a bitch!” 
“Jeez, little buddy, you’re going to 
be all right, you gotta be — ” “Get a 
doctor!” 

Jeannine Leone came out of Ke- 
vin’s cabin and dove to the group 
holding Lundgren. Her hands 
worked frantically at the wound. “I 
can’t get a grip,” she said. “You, 
hold him against the deck. One of 
you hold onto my feet. Not like 
that! Hold me steady, I have to get 
pressure on this — ” 

Blood continued to stream into 
the ship. Bright crimson spheres 
floated toward the air intake grid. 
“We need weight,” Jeannine 
shouted. “Send for the Captain — ” 

“I’m here,” Greiner said. 



“We need weight. Not much, just 
enough to let me do steady work. 
Can you give us acceleration?” 

“No,” Greiner said. “Can’t do 
it.” 

“But he’ll die—” 

“I hope not, but we can’t do it!” 
The Captain’s face was grim. “If 
we accelerate now we won’t get to 
Ceres at all.” 

Jeannine continued working, but 
finally she straightened and shook 
her head. “Too late,” she said. 
“He’s dead. I don’t know if I could 
have done anything even if we had 
gravity.” She turned to Bill Dykes. 

1 m sorry — 

“Not your fault,” the miner said. 
He looked at his partner’s body, 
then at Frank Sales. “Now we got a 
murderer to deal with. I say we put 
him outside now and get it over 
with.” 



IX 

“Trial! We gotta have a trial,” 
someone shouted. The Captain 
agreed. Eventually it was settled. 
Of course everyone wanted to watch. 

There was no place aboard Way- 
farer large enough to assemble the 
entire ship’s company. The ward- 
room deck could hold about half of 
them, with people perched around 
the walls and hanging onto the deck 
above. The rest had to scatter 
through the central well. Since it 
wasn’t possible to understand what 
was said from more than ten feet 



62 



GALAXY 




away Captain Greiner had everyone 
put on their helmets and tune to a 
common channel. Eventually ev- 
eryone was settled, some scattered 
all through the ship, others on the 
wardroom deck. It was not an or- 
derly meeting. 

‘‘There are few precedents,” 
Captain Greiner said, “but this isn’t 
the first murder in space. I am not 
sure the previous cases apply, how- 
ever. In the first space murder the 
satellite commander tried the case 
himself, and himself executed the 
murderer. Although the comman- 
der — it was Aeneas MacKenzie, by 
the way — offered to employ the en- 
tire satellite crew as jury, there were 
complications including threats 
against the families of crew mem- 
bers, and MacKenzie ended by act- 
ing alone. 

“However, in that case there was 
no doubt about the guilt of the mur- 
derer, or that the crime was pre- 
meditated: the murder was part of a 
scheme to sabotage the satellite. 
Few have questioned the justice of 
MacKenzie ’s actions.” 

Kevin felt Ellen shudder. 

“What’s the matter?” he asked. 

“Nothing,” she said; but her 
voice was low and tightly control- 
led. 

“This is farcical,” someone 
shouted. Kevin couldn’t tell who it 
was; the voice came through his 
headphones. “You can’t even es- 
tablish that there’s been a murder, 
and there is no impartial jury. 
Everyone here is prejudiced.” 



“Who the hell is that?” Bill 
Dykes thundered. “Not been a mur- 
der? My partner's dead, and this 
bastard did it, and what’s there to 
talk about? Put him outside and get 
it over with!” 

Someone else shouted, “I got no 
use for Sales, but we have to let 
him tell his story — ” 

“Sure,” Dykes said. “We listen 
to him, then we put him outside!” 

Everyone began to talk at once. 
“It was a goddam accident — ” 
“What the hell, fair fight—” 
“Damn murderin' bastard never was 
any use — ” 

“Silence,” Greiner said. His 
voice carried authority. “We are 
holding this meeting to determine 
what we shall do. It will not be- 
come a shouting match.” 

“There’s plenty of precedent 
from sailing ship days,” someone 
said. “You can do anything you 
think best for the welfare of the 
ship.” 

“I am aware of that,” Captain 
Greiner said. “As most of you 
know, I am an engineer and aircraft 
pilot by training. I do not come 
from a navy tradition and 1 must say 
I am reluctant to assume supreme 
authority — ' ’ 

“You have to,” someone 
shouted. 

“But if that is what is needed, I 
will do so,” Greiner finished. 

Someone jumped up through the 
well to land in front of Captain 
Greiner. “I’m Martin Pacifico,” 
he said. “I’m a lawyer.” 



EXILES TO GLORY 



63 




There was a chorus of boos and 
hisses. “Who needs himT' Bill 
Dykes shouted. 

It didn’t seem to bother Pacifico. 
“Captain Greiner, the essence of a 
fair trial is an impartial jury. Obvi- 
ously there is no possibility of such 
here. Even if there had been — and 
most of the passengers were witnes- 
ses to the alleged crime and thus 
were already not competent as 
Jurors — your insistence on discus- 
sing this matter before the entire 
ship’s company has contaminated all 
possible veniremen — ’’ 

“Oh, shut up!’’ Dykes yelled. 
“Captain, get that yo-yo out of 
here. My partner’s dead, and dam- 
mit — ’’ 

“Enough,’’ Captain Greiner said. 
“Mr. Pacifico, are you suggesting 
we wait until we reach Ceres to 
hold the trial?’’ 

“That won’t do either,’’ Pacifico 
said. “Ceres has no jurisdiction — 

“So we must wait until Sales is 
returned to Earth?” Greiner asked. 
“Which could be ten years, or 
could be never — ” 

“Shut that goddam lawyer up,” 
Dykes yelled. There were other 
shouts of agreement. 

“May I speak?” 

Kevin didn’t recognize the new- 
comer, but Greiner evidently did. 
“Yes, Mr. Harwitt?” the Captain 
said. 

“Harwitt?” Kevin asked. 

“The Westinghouse supervisor,” 
Ellen said. They spoke without us- 
ing their microphones. 



“Captain,” Joe Harwitt said. 
“My company has an interest in this 
matter. Lundgren had signed up to 
work for us in the Ceres refinery 
and we paid for his passage. But 
now we have no one to do his 
work. I think that Sales owes us 
restitution. ” 

“That is a civil matter,” Pacifico 
said. “Not under consideration here. 
I would be glad to represent you, 
though — ” 

“Oh, shut up,” Harwitt said. “I 
don’t want money damages ten 
years from now, 1 want a refinery 
worker! It is too late to bring some- 
one else out to take his place, but 
we can get some use out of Sales. 
He will have to do.” 

“I say, wait a moment — ” 

Captain Greiner seemed resigned. 
“Yes, Dr. Vaagts. I expected to 
hear from you sooner or later.” 
“Sales is signed up with Rhein- 
mettal,” Vaagts said, “and we will 
need him. You can't take him for 
Westinghouse — ” 

“Does Rheinmettal stand respon- 
sible for his actions?” Harwitt de- 
manded. “You brought him here.” 
“Don’t be ridiculous.” 

“I’m not being ridiculous. Some- 
body's got to compensate Westing- 
house for the loss of our worker. I 
say we have a right to Sales as re- 
placement for Lundgren.” 

“But he would be of little use to 
you,” Vaagts said. “You admit he 
is untrained for refinery work. But 
he has a good record in deep mining 
operations, and we can use him. 



64 



GALAXY 




Suppose, Joseph, that we keep him 
working for us, and compensate you 
for Lundgren’s passage with funds 
withheld from his pay?” 

“Rather have a worker than 
money,” Harwitt said. “But I sup- 
pose we could make a deal. You’d 
have to pay interest, of course.” 

“I think that can be agreed,” 
Vaagts said. 

“You are speaking of slavery!” 
Pacifico shouted. 

“Damn it, what about my dead 
partner?” Dykes demanded. “And 
his family back on Earth?” 

“Ah,” Vaagts said. “1 suppose 
restitution to Lundgren’s family is in 
order as well — we will divide 
Sales’s pay between Westinghouse 
and Lundgren’s family — ” 

“Slavery',” Pacifico said again. 
“You can’t do this to me,” Sales 
shouted. 

Everyone began talking at once. 
“Civil rights — ” “Screw his 
rights — ” 

“Put the bastard outside and get 
it over with,” Dykes said again. He 
didn’t sound so positive now. 
“Only — maybe it’s not so bad, 
making him pay — ” 

“We still have not established 
Mr. Sales’s legal obligation to any- 
one , Pacifico said. 

“Captain, may 1 respectfully re- 
quest,” Dr. Vaagts said, “that if 
that extremely unpleasant lawyer 
person does not keep silent so that 
interested parties can come to 
agreement, we put hi?n outside — ” 
“And who’d pay Interplanet 



compensation for losing Pacifico?” 
someone asked. 

“Take up a collection?” another 
voice added hopefully. 

“Let us first determine who are 
the interested parties,” Captain 
Greiner said. “First, of course, Mr. 
Sales himself.” 

“Glad you jokers realize I’m still 
here,” Sales said. 

“Shut up,” Dykes yelled. 

“Second,” Captain Greiner con- 
tinued, “the relatives and friends of 
Mr. Lundgren. Certainly they must 
have a voice in any settlement. 
Third, the two companies: Rhein- 
mettal, which employs Sales and 
has paid for his passage; and West- 
inghouse, which has lost the ser- 
vices of Mr. Lundgren. Are there 
any others?” 

“Justice!” Pacifico said loudly. 

“If all interested parties are 
satisfied then justice has probably 
been served,” Greiner said. “Now: 
Mr. Dykes, what do you propose?” 

“Put him out — only I’ll say this. 
If Carol Lundgren and the kids can 
get something out of this, that’d be 
better. Won’t do them any good if 
we space this little creep.” 

“So. And we have heard the 
proposals of the interested firms,” 
Greiner said. “It now remains to 
hear from Mr. Sales himself. Sales, 
you are charged with murder. How 
do you plead?” 

“It was a goddam accident — ” 

“We can, if you like, call witnes- 
ses and determine just what hap- 
pened,” Greiner said. “But I think

we already know. There was an ar- 
gument. You began a fight. You 
were losing it, and for whatever 
reason you drew a weapon which 
you used to menace Mr. Lundgren. 
Do you disagree so far?” 

“Well — I just wanted to make 
him stop heatin’ on me,” Sales 
said. “I didn’t intend to hurt him! 
You all saw it, somebody pushed 
him, he fell into my knife. I didn't 
go after him.” 

“1 do not dispute that,” Greiner 
said. “Does anyone?'’ 

There were murmurs, but no one 
spoke up. 

'“About the way 1 saw it,” Kevin 
said. Ellen nodded. 

“The fact remains that you drew 
the weapon and menaced Mr. 
Lundgren with it, and thus you are 
the responsible party. You also be- 
gan the fight.” 

“He provoked me — ” 

“But you struck the first blow.” 
“Fair fight’s no murder,” some- 
one said. 

“Perhaps,'’ Greiner said. “But 
this was hardly a fair fight, with one 
party armed and the other not 
warned. 1 do not say what I would 
do if there were a formal duel 
aboard my ship, but I do say this 
was not a fair fight as 1 understand 
it. Have we established the facts to 
everyone’s satisfaction?” 

“This is terrible procedure,” 
Pacifico shouted. 

Greiner ignored him. “Then, Mr. 
Sales, you are certainly guilty of 



manslaughter. Do you dispute 
that?” 

“He provoked me,” Sales in- 
sisted. 

“And you are accordingly found 
guilty of that charge,” Greiner said. 
“We have no jail facilities aboard 
this ship, and it is not my job to 
provide punishment in any event. I 
sentence you to forfeiture of all pay 
and allowances for five years. You 
will continue to be employed by 
Rheinmettal, which will take suffi- 
cient measures to prevent your in- 
juring anyone else, and your pay will 
be divided equally between the 
family of your victim and the com- 
pany which employed him. So or- 
dered. First Officer, write it into the 
log and I’ll sign it. Dr. Vaagts, I 
deliver this man into your care. The 
ship’s company is dismissed. 

★ ★ ★ 

The rest of the trip to Ceres was 
uneventful — until the last day. 

Kevin had once again been as- 
signed to bridge duties, which con- 
sisted mostly of keeping the Captain 
and First Officer company, and 
making coffee in free fall — not the 
easiest job Kevin had ever done. 

The last phase of the voyage was 
to be an acceleration lasting nearly 
three hours. Wayfarer was in a long 
elliptical orbit that crossed that of 
Ceres; in order to land on the as- 
teroid it would be necessary to both 
change the ship’s direction and to 
catch up with the tiny planet. The 



66 



GALAXY 




process began hours before the 
bum, with Wayfarer s electronic 
gear getting a precise position and 
velocity fix. The ship had to be lo- 
cated precisely, with relation to 
Ceres. 

Captain Greiner programmed the 
radar antenna to seek out the beacon 
signal from Ceres. “Here goes,” he 
said. He pressed the keys to initiate 
the position fix, then reached for a 
squeeze-bottle of hot coffee. He 
squirted coffee into his mouth, 
swallowed, and looked back at the 
control board. Then he frowned. 
“What the devil?” 

“Sir?” First Officer Leslie 
Seymour floated over to the Cap- 
tain’s station. 

“I’m not getting anything,” 
Greiner said. “Nothing at all.” 
“That’s odd,” Seymour said. 
“It’s as if the antenna wasn’t work- 
ing. Maybe I’d better have a 
look—” 

“Maybe you had. Mister.” 
Seymour was already wearing his 
pressure suit. He reached for his 
helmet. 

“shutdown, warning, com- 
puter SHUTDOWN,” the computer 
announced. 

“The hell you say!” Greiner 
muttered. He turned to the ship’s 
computer and examined displays. 
“Damn! Leslie, it says it has a 
power interrupt!” 

“Jeez. Antenna not working and 
now the computer’s going out — ” 
“Check out the antenna,” 
Greiner ordered. He lifted his inter- 



com microphone. “Chief Engineer! 
Mister Camel, get up here on the 
double. Something’s happened to 
the computer. Leslie, on your way, 
now.” 

“Yes, sir.” Seymour left the 
bridge, headed for the main airlock. 

“What’s happening. Captain?” 
Kevin asked. “Is there something 
wrong with the computer?” 

“Damned wrong,” Greiner said. 
“And we can’t possibly make ren- 
dezvous with Ceres without it — 
there you are, Felipe. Look at this 
thing!” 

Felipe Carjiel looked at the shut- 
down message, then opened a panel 
and stared at dials. “It says that 
regulated power’s been cut off, 
Skipper,” he said. 

“Regulated power? Where the 
hell’s that power supply?” 

“Back aft,” Camel said. “It’s 
never given any trouble before.” 

“Better go have a look,” Greiner 
said. 

“Rojj.” Camel turned to leave 
the bridge. 

“And have a look at the seals on 
the cargo hold,” Greiner said 
thoughtfully. 

The engineer looked back quick- 
ly. There was astonishment and 
worry in his voice. “Sir, you don’t 
think—” 

“Mister, I don’t know what to 
think. Just check things out.” 

“Aye aye, sir.” Camel left hur- 
riedly. 

“Sir?” Kevin asked. “I thought 
we got power from the reactor.” 



EXILES TO GLORY 



67 




“We do,” Greiner said. “And 
there's no problem with the main 
power system. You can see that — 
the ventilation system’s working, 
the lights are on. Nothing wrong 
there. But the brain here eats a very 
precise diet. It wants 400 cycle 
power, and that doesn’t mean 399.9 
either. If the brain's not getting 
what it wants, it shuts down to 
avoid damage to itself.” Greiner 
frowned. “In fact, I wonder if it’s 
not reporting antenna problems 
when all that’s wrong is the power 
supply? We’ll find out.” Greiner 
didn’t seem very worried. 

It didn’t seem serious, and Kevin 
went back to making more coffee. 
After all, they had ten hours before 
they started the engine. Besides — he 
could see Ceres in the ship’s main 
telescope. He had watched it grow' 
from a point to a recognizable ob- 
ject, no details but definitely a disc. 
They could aim for it and blast — 

First Officer Seymour came back 
onto the bridge. “The antenna’s 
gone. Skipper.” 

“Gone?” 

“Clean gone. Like it was sawed 
off, or maybe blasted off with a 
couple of turns of prima-cord. 
Gone, anyway.” 

“Bat puckey. It can’t be gone,” 
Greiner said. “Blasted off? Sabo- 
tage?” 

“Looks like it to me,” Seymour 
said. 

“Hmm. Well, we can still navi- 
gate with the telescope. If we get 
the computer running again,” 



Greiner said. “But if — you really 
think it was sabotage, Leslie?” 

“Yes, sir. What else could it 
be?” 

They waited in silence. Finally 
Kevin asked, “If the computer's re- 
ally out, what happens?” 

“We don’t get to Ceres,” 
Greiner said. His voice was grim. 

“Three years to home,” Seymour 
added. “If we’re lucky we can cut 
some off that, but not a lot. Think 
this tub will keep us alive for three 
more years. Skipper?” 

“It might. With a lot of work,” 
Greiner said. He looked thoughtful. 
“Present orbit takes us out to better 
than three and a half AU before we 
head back toward Earth. Less than 
ten percent of the sunlight we get 
down near Earth. It’d be close for a 
while. Not much light for the ship’s 
farm.” 

“But — 1 can see Ceres,” Kevin 
protested. 

Greiner laughed without humor. 
“Sure. But how much do I burn 
aimed in what direction? Kevin, 
we’ve got Just enough fuel aboard 
to set us down on Ceres. Nothing to 
spare for mistakes. Without the 
ship’s computer we could never do 
it—” 

“Can we get back to Earth with- 
out the computer?” Kevin asked. 

“No. But that’s not the problem. 
It’s only the power supply. If we 
have to we can build another. We 
can build another antenna, too — 
ah.” He stopped as Felipe Camel 
came back into the bridge compart-

ment. “Well?" Greiner demanded 
impatiently. 

“Cargo seals are all intact,” 
Camel said. “I put Phelps on watch 
down there, just in case — " 

“Phelps alone?" 

“No, I asked three passengers, 
random selection, to stand watch 
with him." 

“Good," Greiner said. “And the 
power system?" 

“Blown to hell," Camel said. 
“Somebody put about fifty grams 
of plastique into the system. Messed 
it up good." 

“And the spare is gone," Greiner 
said quietly. 

“Might as well be. Been taken 
apart into little bits." 

“How long to rebuild?" Greiner 
demanded. His tone indicated that 
he already knew the answer. 

“Days," Camel said. “Three or 
four days anyway." 

“By which time we’ll be long 
past Ceres and headed out to 
nowhere," Greiner said. “Interest- 
ing. Someone put a lot of thought 
into this. He's sabotaged the exact 
two systems to keep us from land- 
ing on Ceres without actually crip- 
pling the ship." 

Greiner’s calm broke at last. 

That son of a bitch! He’s done it! 
I cant't put the cargo on Ceres — " 
he shouted. 

“And there may never be another 
ship out here again," Felipe Camel 
finished for him. “Somebody's just 
damned near killed the whole as- 
teroid mining business."

“There must be something we 
can do." First Officer Seymour 
pounded his fist into his palm. 
“Raise Earth and have them run off 
the problem in Zurich — ’’ 

“Without the high-gain an- 
tenna?" Felipe Camel laughed. “We 
can’t raise Earth without that an- 
tenna." 

“Ceres, then," Seymour said. 
“They’ve got a big computer — ’’ 

“And no programs," Captain 
Greiner said. “And once again, 
without the antenna, we can’t rely 
on comnlunications with them. 
We’ll try, but I’ve no confidence." 
Greiner looked at the last print-outs 
from the ship’s computer. Way- 
farer's last known poasition was 
one hundred thousand kilometers 
from Ceres. The ship’s orbit crossed 
that of the asteroid at a sharp angle; 
Wayfarer would have to change di- 
rection, then catch up; in practice 
that meant a smooth curve stretch- 
ing from Wayfarer's present course 
to the asteroid's orbit, with a slight 
change of orbit plane as well — and 
Ceres moves at eighteen kilometers 
each second. 

The problem was not merely to 
get to Ceres, but to arrive with 
exactly the same velocity as the as- 
teroid, and going in exactly the 
same direction. The navigation 
would be only slightly less compli- 
cated than hitting a BB in flight 
with another BB fired by a gunner 
who had bad eyesight. An error of a 



EXILES TO GLORY 



69 




tenth of a kilometer per second 
would put the ship impossibly far 
away from its target. 

“Leslie, try raising Ceres,” 
Captain Greiner said. “Let’s see if 
they have advice.” 

First Officer Seymour floated to 
the communications set and an- 
chored himself to the stool. He 
lifted the microphone and began 
calling. 

“What I want to know is who,'' 
Greiner said. “Damned clever chap, 
whoever it was. This was well 
planned. We keep our fuel, drift on 
in our ellipse, and eventually return 
to Earth. Stops us without commit- 
ting suicide.” 

“But why?” Kevin asked. 

Greiner shook his head. “Who’d 
benefit from this? Too many to 
count. The African mining outfits 
don’t want competition from as- 
teroid mines. Anti-technology 
people want to stop space explora- 
tion altogether — ” 

“Lunar mining outfits,” Felipe 
Camel cut in. “Or even the O’Neill 
colony people — they’ve been mak- 
ing noises about what a waste Belt 
operations are — ” 

“Skipper, I’ve got them, but they 
can’t understand me,” Leslie 
Seymour said. “OUR COMPUTER 
IS OUT,” he shouted, then looked 
sheepish, “They just don’t read 
us.” 

“Maybe when we get closer — ” 
Kevin said. 

“By then it will be too late,” 
Greiner said. He stared at Kevin.

“You look like a man with an idea. 
Have you thought of something?” 
“Possibly. Captain, I know 
somebody who can compute the 
burn for us.” 

“Who? And how—” 

“My cabinmate, Jacob Norse- 
dal.” 

“Norsedal,” Greiner said. “He’s 
been up here a number of times. 
Very interested in our ship’s brain. 
Yes, I’d say he knows computers, 
but this isn’t a computer problem, 
Kevin. We cannot rebuild that 
power supply in the few hours we 
have left, and we don’t need a pro- 
gram, we need a computer — ” 

“Yes, sir, but he’s got his own,” 
Kevin said. 

“I’ve seen it,” Greiner said. 
“Kevin, he can’t possibly do this 
calculation with that little belt 
model he carries — ” 

“I wouldn’t bet on that,” Kevin 
said. “But he doesn’t have to. He’s 
got a much bigger one in our cabin. 
Uses it for wargames. Recreation 
stuff. And he’s been keeping track 
of Wayfarer. He calculated the mid- 
course correction you made, and 
said something about it being off, 
but not much — ” 

Grenier looked thoughtful. “Feli- 
pe, go ask Mr. Norsedal to come 
to the bridge. And ask him to 
bring that extra brain with him.” 
“Right,” Camel said. 

“And you needn’t tell the 
passengers about our problem,” 
Greiner added. He waited until the 
engineer had left the control cabin.

“Now. Kevin, how sure are you 
that Mr. Norsedal isn’t the one who 
bollixed our system to begin with? I 
wonder who else could have 
thought of this method?’’ 

“You’d think that was funny if 
you knew Jacob,’’ Kevin said. 
“He’s a space fanatic. Also a com- 
puter fanatic — he likes them more 
than he likes people. He’d never 
harm one.’’ 

“I point out to you that this one 
hasn’t been harmed,’’ Greiner said. 
“And I grant you it’s not likely, but 
it’s certainly possible that someone 
who seems to be a space fanatic 
could be one of the anti-technology 
people. They do study technological 
systems, you know.’’ 

“Possibly, but Jacob isn’t against 
technology,’’ Kevin insisted. 

“I hope you’re right.’’ 

■A" ★ ★ 

When Camel returned with Nor- 
sedal, Captain Greiner explained the 
problem. “Senecal here thinks you 
can do something,’’ Greiner said. 

“How much time do we have?” 
Norsedal asked. 

“The burn was scheduled to take 
place in four hours.” Grenier an- 
swered. 

“Not much time.” Norsedal 
looked thoughtful. 

“No. Well, it was just a possibil- 
ity. I didn’t really believe in — ” 

“But 1 think we can do some- 
thing,” Norsedal said. He went 
over to the chart table and placed an 



attache case on it, using the table 
straps to hold it in place. He an- 
chored himself to the stool at the 
table, then opened the case and pat- 
ted the computer inside. “Nice 
computer. Fortunately, I already 
have some of the programs we’ll 
need. Now let’s see — ” 

Jacob opened another compart- 
ment and took out paper. “Captain, 

I can program the course, but I 
can’t possibly patch my computer 
into the ship’s drive system — ” 

“No sweat,” Felipe Camel inter- 
jected. “We’ve got a lot of little 
special-purpose computers for that. 
One is slaved to the gyro system 
and controls the engine thrust. You 
tell the ship where to go and I’ll see 
that she goes there.” 

“Good. I thought so,” Norsedal 
said. “If you didn’t have a lot of 
smaller computers dedicated to spe- 
cial purposes, the air system 
wouldn’t work — ” He began to 
work furiously. Pencils and paper 
floated away from him, to be re- 
trieved by one of the others. He 
drank coffee constantly. 

An hour went by. Then another. 
Finally Norsedal began punching 
input buttons. 

“Done?” Captain Greiner asked. 
“1 have the basic program. Now 
we have to get it checked out and 
running,” Norsedal said. He con- 
tinued to type inputs. “Now we’ll 
just try — ” 

He pressed buttons. There was a 
moment of silence, then the read- 
out screen filled with numbers. 



EXILES TO GLORY

“Stopped on an input error,” Nor- 
sedal muttered. “That’s simple 
enough.” He typed for a moment, 
then looked up. “Captain, have you 
decided you will fly this course 
once I have it?” 

“I’m still thinking about that,” 
Greiner said. “No point in making 
decisions unless there’s something 
to decide. Do you think you’ll have 
it?” 

“Probably.” Norsedal didn’t look 
up from his console. He muttered, 
sometimes to himself, sometimes to 
the computer. “Nice computer, tell 
me what I did wrong this 
time ...” 

“I don’t like this much,” Leslie 
Seymour said. 

“Nor I,” Greiner said. “But you 
know what happens if we do not de- 
liver this cargo.” 

“Yes. I suppose we have to try.” 
Seymour went to the main tele- 
scope. “At least we can get decent 
bearings,” he said. “There’s Ceres, 
nice and clear — ” 

“I hope so,” Norsedal said. “I 
had to compute the course as a 
function of the position of Ceres 
relative to Vega. We’ll need con- 
stant sightings on both.” 

“We can get them,” Seymour 
said. “Captain, maybe it wouldn’t 
be a bad idea to protect the main 
telescope. Before that son of a bitch 
gets to it — ” 

“Good thinking,” Captain Greiner 
said. “In fact, we ought to locate 
all the passengers and crew and 
set them to watching each other 



before there’s more sabotage. I 
should have thought of that earli- 
er.” Greiner was apologetic. “I 
was never a ship captain, merely an 
astronaut with the European Space 
Program. Not the best training for 
what we’re faced with. Leslie, see 
to it, will you?” 

“Right, Skipper. Senecal, come 
with me, please. I want you to go 
outside and watch the telescope 
until we’re certain that everyone is 
accounted for.” 

“Not alone,” Greiner said. “Not 
that we don’t trust you, Kevin — but 
who can we trust?” 

“I understand,” Kevin said. 
“May I use your intercom?” 

“What for?” 

“To call a friend.” He went to 
the intercom panel and dialled a 
stateroom number. “Ellen, they’ve 
asked me to do an EVA. Will you 
come with me?” 

“Who did you call?” Greiner 
asked. 

“Ellen MacMillan. We’ve worked 
together on other jobs in this 
ship, and I know she can take care 
of herself outside.” 

“I heard about your difficulty 
getting to Wayfarer , Greiner said. 
“Yes. I’d think MacMillan would 
be a good partner. Certainly we 
could trust her.” 

“But Skipper,” Leslie Seymour 
protested. “We can’t let her go 
outside — ” 

“Now that she’s said she will, 
have you any way you can think of 
to stop her?” Greiner demanded. 



72 



GALAXY 




And what is this all about, Kevin 
wondered. He had no time to ask. 

Seymour sighed. “No. I don’t 
suppose I can,’’ he said. “I guess 
she’ll do nicely. Let’s go find her.’’ 
He opened the companionway door. 

There were three people waiting 

outside in the main corridor. One 
came in quickly, pushing past 
Seymour. 

“Mr. Pacifico, what the devil are 
you doing on my bridge?’’ Captain 
Greiner demanded. 

“I represent the passengers,’’ 
Pacifico said. His voice, already 
garbled by the lower atmospheric 
pressure in the ship, sounded shrill 
and petulant. “We’ve been told that 
the main computer is out, and 
you’re going to chance a landing on 
Ceres anyway.’’ 

“Who told you?’’ Felipe Camel 
demanded. 

“It’s all over the ship,’’ Pacifico 
said. He turned to the others who 
had come in with him. “Isn’t it?’’ 

“That happens to be the case,’’ 
Dr. Vaagts said. 

“I hadn’t expected you to pro- 
test,’’ Greiner said. 

“Nor am I protesting,’’ Vaagts 
said. “I merely wanted to know 
what is happening. Mr. Pacifico 
certainly doesn’t represent me, or 
Rheinmettal.’’ 

“So who do you represent, 
Pacifico?’’ Camel asked. 

“Most of the passengers. We 
demand that we be consulted before 
you undertake a dangerous ma- 
neuver like this. Isn’t it true that if 



you do nothing we’ll go back to 
Earth, but if you try for Ceres and 
miss we’ll have no fuel left? We’ll 
all be dead?’’ 

“True enough,’’ Greiner said. 
“And what confidence do you 
have in — you’ve got him doing it? 
The wargamer? Captain, you can’t 
do this. You must take a vote — ’’ 
“Vote hell. Leslie, you and 
Senecal were going out to locate all 
the ship’s company.’’ 

“Right, Skipper,’’ Seymour said. 
“And you, Pacifico, get off my 
bridge. Now. Or I’ll have you 
thrown off.’’ 

“We have rights — ’’ 

“Leslie, heave him out.’’ 

“With pleasure. Captain.’’ First 
Officer Seymour launched himself 
toward the lawyer. 

“I’m leaving,’’ Pacifico said. 
“But you haven’t heard the last of 
this, Greiner. You are not a king, 
and this isn’t the Eighteenth 
Century — ’’ He went out quickly as 
Seymour prepared to take hold of 
him. 

Kevin found Ellen in her cabin. 
He explained what had happened. 
“Finish getting into your suit,’’ he 
told her. “We’re supposed to go 
outside and look after the main tele- 
scope.’’ 

“Sure. You wait out in the cor- 
ridor.’’ 

“Sure you don’t need any help?’’ 
“Thank you, no.’’ 

When they reached the airlock, 
Seymour had got most of the 
passengers together in the central 



EXILES TO GLORY

well. A crewman guarded the air- 
lock. Kevin and Ellen checked their 
air supplies, then went out as 
Seymour was calling the roll of the 
ship’s company. 

★ ★ ★ 

Wayfarer had two airlocks. One 
was right in the bows, a large dock- 
ing port that allowed smaller space 
capsules to link up with the ship, 
and could also be used to link with 
an airtight corridor connecting the 
ship with the Ceres spaceport, or 
even with another ship. The other 
was a smaller personnel lock on the 
side of the hull just aft of the bows. 
Kevin and Ellen went out that way. 
There was a small ladder leading 
forward. 

With no gravity they had to be 
careful not to drift away from the 
ship. It would be easy to jump en- 
tirely away from Wayfarer. Al- 
though they couldn’t fall off — they 
were moving at the same velocity as 
Wayfarer, and would until the 
ship’s engines were started up — if 
anyone became separated from the 
ship he would drift away forever, 
moving slowly out into space. 

They climbed carefully to the 
forward end of the ship and rounded 
it. Now there was nothing ahead of 
them at all. Wayfarer floated among 
a river of stars, bright starlight and 
the black shadows of space, and 
there was no sense of motion at all. 
They hung in glory. The sun was 
behind the ship so that they were 



both in deep shadow, with just 
enough starlight so they could see 
each other. Their flashlights made 
small pools of light on the ship’s 
dark hull. 

‘"Magnificent,” Kevin mur- 
mured. ”1 could stay here for the 
rest of the trip.” 

Ellen floated over to him and si- 
lently touched his gloved hand. It 
wasn’t a moment for talking. They 
found places to anchor themselves 
and waited in silence. The bin tele- 
scope was a few meters away. It 
moved slightly as Captain Greiner 
took sights. 

Kevin searched for constellations 
among the stars. He could make out 
only a few of the traditional ones; 
there were too many stars, millions 
more than the ancient Babylonians 
who had named the constellations 
had ever been able to see. 

“Now that our eyes are adjusted, 
we'd best have a look at the tele- 
scope,” Ellen said. 

“Right.” They moved across the 
blunt bow of the spaceship. There 
were convenient handholds at inter- 
vals. Wayfarer would never enter an 
atmosphere and had no need for 
streamlining. 

The telescope was large, over a 
foot in diameter, with flexible seals 
that let it pass through the ship’s 
hull and into the control bridge. 
They moved next to it and 
examined it with their flashlights. 

“That doesn’t belong there.” 
Ellen sounded very calm and not 
surprised. Her light indicated some-

thing about the size and shape of a 
coffee can. It was taped to the tele- 
scope barrel. 

“It may go off anyway. When 
you move it,” Kevin said. “Get 
away from it — ” 

“This is my job,” she said. 
“Move back. Farther.” 

“No. You move — ” 

“I told you, it’s my job. Now 
move or don’t, I’m going to take 
this thing off.” 

Kevin felt like an idiot. He was 
afraid of the bomb, and he was also 
unwilling to move away to safety 
while Ellen worked on it. 

“Idiot, somebody’s got to tell 
them what happened,” Ellen said. 
“If it goes off. So get away from 
here — ” 

“No.” 

“Stubborn idiot.” 

“No worse than you are — ” 
“True. There. I have it.” She 
held up the can. “It didn't explode 
yet.” She crawled toward the side 
of the ship, then got a firm grip on 
the handhold with her left hand. 
With her right she threw the can 
outward, away from the ship. They 
watched it dwindle and vanish into 
space. “Maybe it was old coffee 
grounds,” she said. 

“Maybe.” Kevin found that he’d 
been holding his breath. “Ellen — 
what did you mean, it’s your job?” 
“I shouldn’t have said that. I was 
scared. Kevin, please — forget that I 
said that. ” 

“Sure,” he said. But he knew he 
wouldn’t. 



“Outside party, this is Sey- 
mour.” The First Officer’s voice 
was loud in Kevin's helmet phones. 
It seemed a grating irritation 
in the silent grandeur of space. 

“We’re here,” Ellen answered. 
“We found a bomb — or something 
that looked like one — attached to 
the telescope.” 

“But when was it put there?” 
Seymour demanded. “I looked at 
the telescope when I checked the 
high gain antenna. I’m sure I would 
have seen anything — ” 

“I don’t know, but it was there,” 
Kevin said. “Ellen threw it off the 
ship about two minutes ago. It will 
be a kilometer away by now.” 

“More like a couple of hundred 
meters,” Ellen said. “It’s difficult 
to throw anything very hard. But 
I’m sure it’s far enough.” 

“Good. That’s not what 1 called 
you about,” Seymour said. “There 
are two passengers missing.” 

“Who?” Kevin asked. 

“George Lange and that Pacifico 
person. ” 

“George?” Ellen was incredu- 
lous. “He couldn’t possibly have 
had anything to do with sabotaging 
the ship.” 

“He’s my boss,” Kevin said. 
“Always trying to get me to work. 
Ellen’s right, he’s not the saboteur. 
Pacifico — well, he’s another mat- 
ter.” 

“I think you ought to have a look 
around,” Seymour said. “But don’t 



EXILES TO GLORY

take long. We start the engines in 
ten minutes, and you’ll have to be 
inside before that.” 

“We’ll go in just before the 
burn,” Ellen said. “Until then — 
somebody put that bomb on the 
telescope. We’ll watch.” 

“Right. Out,” Seymour said. 
Ellen moved closer to Kevin. 
“Turn off your radio,” she said. 
When he did, she put her helmet 
against his. “Do you have any kind 
of weapon?” 

“Only the knife in my tool kit.” 
“I wish we had a pistol.” 

“But — there aren’t any pistols 
aboard, no guns at all.” 

“How do you know?” she de- 
manded. “Kevin, I’m worried.” 
“About Pacifico? He's a 
pipsqueak — ” 

“He seems to be. But if Lange is 
missing, someone killed him. He 
wouldn’t have any reason to hide. 
He must have caught the saboteurs 
in the act, and they killed him.” 
Kevin tried to remember what lit- 
tle he knew about Lange. It wasn’t 
much. He'd brought Kevin the tapes 
and made him study them, and he'd 
talked in a general way about the 
work Deadalus Corporation would 
be doing on Ceres. Nothing defi- 
nite. “How can you be so sure it 
wasn’t Lange who planted the 
bomb?” Kevin demanded. 

“I’m sure. Kevin, I think we 
should separate. You go watch the 
port side. I'll watch the starboard. 
Burn is ten minutes from now. We 
have to keep anyone from getting 



up here during the next five min- 
utes. Then we’ll be safe; and we’ll 
be able to put the cargo down on 
Ceres — ” 

She started to move away, but 
Kevin caught her and pulled her 
back until he could put his helmet 
against hers. “Be careful,” he said. 

“Sure.’' 

And, he wondered as he crawled 
toward the port side of the ship, 
what the hell is that cargo? Captain 
Greiner talked about it. So does El- 
len. Everyone seems to know but 
me . there had been one series 
of launch capsules that had been 
guarded by company police and 
Mexican Army tanks. What could 
be that valuable? 

He reached the edge and looked 
along the ship, past the hydrogen 
tanks to the big ring at the end of 
the ship. Nothing moved. He won- 
dered if he should show a light. If 
someone really wanted to cripple 
Wayfarer, it would only take 
puncturing a couple of those tanks. 

But that would completely cripple 
the ship. It would be suicide for the 
saboteur, and so far whoever was 
doing this had been careful not to 
really damage Wayfarer, just put 
the ship out of operation for a few' 
hours until it would be too late to 
get to Ceres. 

If he could reach the telescope, 
though, he could still keep them 
from landing. 

Lange. Could it have been 
George Lange? How likely that 
Pacifico could knock out the an- 



76 



GALAXY 




tenna and computer power supply? 
Or kill Lange? Pacifico wasn't 
much larger than Ellen, while 
Lange was bigger than Kevin. Not 
that that meant anything — being 
large was no real advantage in free 
fall. It just meant long legs to bump 
into things. But Kevin doubted that 
Pacifico knew enough about the 
ship to have been the saboteur — 

He glanced at his watch. Five 
minutes to burn: time to be getting 
inside. Even as he thought it, 
Seymour's voice came into his 
headset. “That ought to do it," the 
First Officer said. “Best get into 
the airlock. We’re going to start 
rotating ship for the burn." 

“Right. Ellen—" 

“Kev, there's somebody out here 
with us!'' Ellen shouted. “1 saw 
him move. Just then. He’s down by 
the tanks." 

“Good Lord." Seymour sounded 
worried. “But we’ve got to start 
maneuvers. We can’t stop now — the 
burn must be exactly on time — 
exactly!" 

“I know," Ellen said quietly. 
“I’m going after him. Kevin, get 
inside." 

“Don’t be silly." He clawed his 
way over the bow of the ship as she 
vanished around the far side. 

“Hang on," Seymour ordered. 
“In one minute and . three sec- 
onds we start turning ship. We have 
to." 

“Right," Kevin answered. “El- 
len. What’s happening?" 

There was no answer. He reached 



the place where he'd last seen her 
and looked aft down the length of 
the ship. There was a flash of light 
from down there somewhere. He 
went over, pulling himself along the 
ladder, trying to make sure he was 
always holding it. 

“If you start the engines I'll 
puncture the tanks!" came a high- 
pitched voice. Pacifico's. He 
sounded determined. Afraid but de- 
termined. “I'll do it!" the lawyer 
shouted. 

“But — why do you want to keep 
us from getting to Ceres?" Seymour 
asked. 

“I don't care about that," 
F\icifico said. “I want to go to 
Ceres. But you won’t get us there! 
You can't navigate this ship with a 
suitcase computer; you’ve no right 
to risk our lives that way!’' 

“If you puncture the tanks you'll 
kill all of us including yourself," 
Kevin said. 

“No I won’t. We don’t need all 
the fuel to get back to Earth. Stay 
away from me! I’ll do it — ’’ 

“We’re turning," Seymour said. 

The ship moved slightly as at- 
titude Jets fired. It rotated slowly. 
Kevin didn’t find it hard to hang 
on, and then the counter-jets fired 
to stop the turn. The ship was now 
heading almost exactly away from 
Ceres. 

Kevin reached the tankage com- 
plex. It was dark among the long 
hydrogen tanks. “Ellen," he called. 

“I see you," she said. “I think 
he’s straight ahead of you." 



EXILES TO GLORY 



77 




“Get away from me,” Pacifico 
screamed. “I’ll do it, I swear I 
will!” 

Kevin moved further into the 
tankage complex. Pacifico’ s voice 
came from nowhere and every- 
where; it was wierd, hearing him 
but being unable to locate him by 
sound. Kevin wondered if the 
lawyer had seen him. He saw no 
one. Not Ellen, not Pacifico. “You 
idiot, all the tanks are connected to- 
gether,’’ Kevin said. “If you 
puncture one of them, you’ll let all 
the fuel escape. ” 

“I don’t believe that,’’ Pacifico 
said. “It wouldn’t make sense as a 
design. Meteoroids — ’’ 

“I’m afraid what Senecal is tell- 
ing you is the truth,’’ Seymour’s 
voice interjected. “The tanks don’t 
connect normally, but when we 
make preparation for using the main 
engines we have to interconnect 
them. Otherwise the fuel would be 
burned out of one tank at a time 
and we’d get off balance.’’ 

That makes sense, Kevin thought. 
I wonder if it’s true? The important 
thing is to get Pacifico talking and 
keep him occupied until we find 
him. And then what? Kevin fin- 
gered the knife in his pouch. That 
seemed drastic — 

“Kev! I’ve got him! Aft of where 
you are and around clockwise sixty 
degrees!’’ Ellen’s voice came in 
panting gasps. 

Kevin moved in the direction 
she’d indicated. He saw Ellen and 
the lawyer struggling like clumsy 



wrestlers, their bulky suits prevent- 
ing either of them from getting a 
decisive hold. 

“One minute to burn,’’ Seymour 
said. “Can you get into the air- 
lock?’’ 

“ ’Fraid not,’’ Ellen said. 
“Maybe we’ll be all right here 
among the tanks — ” Her voice rose. 
“Kevin!’’ she shouted in terror. 

Both of them had moved away 
from the ship. Somehow they’d 
both lost their holds on the ship 
while trying to fight each other, and 
now they drifted free, a few feet 
away, unable to get back. 

“My God! Help!’’ Pacifico 
screamed. 

“Burn in forty seconds,’’ 
Seymour said. 

“You can’t!” Pacifico screamed. 
“It’s inhuman! You’ll kill us!” 

“Can’t delay,” Seymour said. 

And he means that, Kevin 
thought. Not that Ellen would want 
him to delay. The Belt operation 
means too much to her. It’s up to 
me, now. He dove forward, through 
the tankage. His months of practice 
in somersaulting through the ship let 
him get through the tanks in a clean 
arc. 

He caught the ladder at the last 
possible moment, and reached out 
toward Ellen. “Grab hold!” he 
called. 

She reached for him, missed by 
inches. He stretched but couldn’t 
catch her. 

“Ten seconds,’’ Seymour an- 
nounced. 



78 



GALAXY 





“We're drifting free of the 
ship!” Pacifico screamed. “You 
can't do this, you can’t — " 

Kevin grabbed the safety line on 
his belt and hooked it to the ladder, 
then, letting the reel run free, leaped 
out toward Ellen. He grabbed her 
with both hands, then jjrunted with 
relief. 

“You damn fool," she said. 
“You'll kill yourself—'' 

“Three. Two. One. Ignite," 
Seymour said. 

The ship’s engines started. There 
was no sound and no flame. Hydro- 
gen was pumped from the tanks and 
into the nuclear pile on its sting at 
the end of the ship. The nuclear 
reactor heated the hydrogen and 
forced it back through nozzles. The 



ship drove forward at a tenth of a 
gravity. 

Kevin felt Ellen as a sudden dead 
weight. He threw in the stop on his 
belt reel, and they dangled from the 
ladder, with nothing holding them 
but the thin nylon line. Pacifico, 
still screaming, vanished behind as 
the ship drove forward. 

As the ship moved, suddenly they 
and the safety line formed a 
pendulum. They felt the accelera- 
tion as they would a tenth of 
Earth's gravity as centrifugal force 
moved them until they swung back 
and forth in a small arc directly be- 
neath the ladder. Kevin painfully 
reached up, still holding Ellen’s 
hand with his. She wasn’t heavy, 
only a tenth of what her weight 



EXILES TO GLORY 



79 




would have been on Earth, but 
Kevin wasn’t used to any gravity. 
He held tightly, irrationally afraid 
that the thin nylon line wouldn’t 
hold their combined weight of fifty 
pounds. He couldn’t quite reach the 
ladder. 

“Help! You can’t leave me here 
to die in space! Help!” Pacifico 
screamed in terror. The ship moved 
inexorably away from him. Within 
thirty seconds he would be nearly 
half a kilometer behind, doomed to 
the loneliest death possible, alone in 
a river of stars and the emptiness of 
space. 

“Can you let me down a little 
further?” Ellen asked. “1 can al- 
most reach one of the fuel pipes — ” 

“No hands,” Kevin said. 
“I’ve—” 

“Here. I’ve got you,” Ellen said. 
“Now let us down a meter or so.” 

“How can you be so damned 
calm?” Kevin snarled. 

He let go of her with one hand 
and reached the ratchet control on 
his belt line. He let the safety line 
run free for a second, then locked it 
again. They both fell toward the aft 
end of the ship, then were brought 
up short by the line. The thin nylon 
held easily. 

“There. I’ve got it,” Ellen said. 
“I’ve got my safety line clipped to 
the pipe support. Here — let out 
more of your line, and i’ll pull you 
over.” 

Kevin did as he was told. Sec- 
onds later he had a purchase on one 
of the fuel pipes. He looked 



up — the forward end of the ship 
was up now, and that was strange, 
to have a definite up and down. The 
pipe supports formed a ladder of 
sorts. It wouldn’t be hard to climb 
back to the regular ladder. 

“I guess we’re safe,” Kevin 
said. 

“Thank God,” Seymour said. 
“You’re sure?” 

“Yes,” Kevin said. 

They could still hear Pacifico’s 
screams. His signal was growing 
weaker as he fell farther and farther 
behind. 

“Pacifico,” Ellen called. “Who 
hired you to sabotage the ship?” 

“1 didn’t do it,” Pacifico’s voice 
said. “You’ve got to come back for 
me! It’s not too late, 1 can see you, 
please, my God. Please, please 
come back for me, I didn’t do it, I 
only wanted to stop this mad — ” 

His voice faded in and out now. 
“Come back. Please come back, 
you can find me, please ...” 

Kevin felt Ellen shudder beside 
him. He put his arm across her 
shoulders and felt her trembling. 
“It’s all right,” he said. “We’re all 
right now — ” 

She didn’t answer. After a while 
she pointed up toward the ladder. 
They began to climb. It seemed to 
take forever to reach the airlock. 
They thought they heard the 
lawyer’s screams, ever fainter, the 
whole time.'

SOME FUTURES 



^^ITH INCREASING FREQUENCY I 
am being asked to lecture at various 
colleges and universities. My mes- 
sage is generally the same: that we 
don’t have to die; that the Club of 
Rome is deluded; that this genera- 
tion can, if we will, make advances 
at least as significant as the control 
of fire, the discovery of the wheel, 
the domestication of animals, yea, 
the invention of agriculture. We 
have only to make the decision, and 
a few sacrifices. The technology 
exists. 

When 1 am done I find a curious 
and almost universal response. First, 
the audience is somewhat over- 
whelmed, which doesn’t surprise me 
because I have developed a lot of 
data and, bluntly. I’m pretty good at 
presenting it. Next, 1 find the mes- 
sage welcome, and few members of 
the audience want to argue. Again 
not surprising: why would anyone, 
particularly the young, want to be- 
lieve anything else? But third, what 
was once a surprise but happens so 
frequently it no longer is: “Where 
have you been? Why has no one 
else told us this? All we hear is that 



Earth is polluted, technology can’t 
save us and is evil to boot, we’re 
running out of resources, there’s 
Only One Earth ...” 

That response doesn’t come only 
from students. At a major south- 
western research institution I got the 
same response when 1 spoke to the 
technical staff. Presumably each of 
the engineers had his own opinions, 
not too different from mine; but the 
prevailing climate of opinion led 
each to believe the others thought 
we were doomed. At the universities 
the students find the faculty mem- 
bers, if they comment on the future 
at all, crying doom. 

So I shuttle back and forth across 
the country, to this institution and 
that, trying desperately to tell 
America's youth that they have a 
future. But do they? 

Because of course 1 cannot tell 
what the future will be. 1 know what 
it can be: a world of plenty, a world 
of “Survival With Style” {Galaxy, 
March, 1976), a world in which the 
United States is wealthy but is not 
merely an island of wealth in a vast 
sea of misery; a world in which 



ASFO: SOME FUTURES 



81 



everyone has more than enough to 
eat and, if they want it, a standard 
of living at least as good as what we 
enjoyed in the 50’s; but that’s only 
what it can be. 

We might go another way. Our 
grandchildren may curse our mem- 
ories. There are times when I am 
convinced that my world will never 
be. 

But what could happen to us? We 
have the technology. There is no 
“energy crisis’’ in any meaningful 
sense — that is, we know how to 
produce the energy we need to sus- 
tain our high-technology society un- 
til such time as we can develop 
eternal sources. We know how to get 
to space, and we could, if we had 
to, begin right now the development 
of capabilities for mining the Moon 
and the asteroid belt. The world al- 
ready grows more than enough food 
to support its population (although 
the distribution system is terrible, 
and insects, rodents, bacilli, fungi, 
and other pests eat more of our 
crops than ever we do, particularly 
in the “developing’’ nations). We 
can survive, and with style; why 
might we not? 

Well, to begin with, there are the 
last two horsemen. War is hardly 
impossible. True, there are signs 
that many rational planners in the 
Soviet Union realize that their own 
development — yea, and survival 
— depends on not conquering the 
West; that the West is more valu- 
able as a trading partner than ever it 
would be as part of an empire man- 



aged as badly as the Soviet Empire 
now is. True, but not decisive. 
There are dinosaurs in the Soviet 
Union, real communists whose 
moral position is intolerable if ever 
they abandon marxism. For an anal- 
ogy: could an Inquisition priest ever 
have admitted even the possibility 
that his religion was not true? Could 
he have lived with himself if ever 
he did? 

And the Soviet Union continues 
to build and develop weapons long 
after any discoverable defensive 
need. Recall the theory? U.S. 
weapons development stimulated the 
Soviets; once we called a halt, and 
they achieved parity, they would see 
the wastefulness of it all — after all, 
weapons cost them far more than us 
(in terms of respective Gross Na- 
tional Products), and they need the 
resources for development far more 
than we do — and they would cease 
this insane arms race. 

So we stopped, and they achieved 
parity, and they achieved superior- 
ity, and they seem headed for 
supremacy, and they halt not, 
neither do they slow; indeed, their 
rate of arms procurement tends 
rather to increase. No, war is no 
impossibility. 

Then there are the fears of cogent 
men like Roberto Vacca, whose 
book The Coming Dark Age cannot 
be ignored. Vacca points out the in- 
creasing complexity of our modern 
civilization, its increasing depen- 
dence on centralized planning and 
control, the interdependence of all 



82 



GALAXY 




parts on each other, the far-reaching 
consequences of seemingly trivial 
errors — recall the power failure in 
the Northeast caused by one 
generator going and kicking out all 
the others? If the margins get thin 
enough, and Vacca believes they 
will, collapse of our civilization 
could be much quicker, and much 
more thorough, than might be sup- 
posed. 

After all, no country is more than 
three meals from bread riots; and 
rioters have been known to act as if 
they believed the best way to feed 
themselves is to bum the bakeries. 
Urban firestorms are hardly impos- 
sible, and the water supply and 
fire fighting systems are vulnerable. 
You might or might not be surprised 
to know just how easily such sys- 
tems could be knocked out, by acci- 
dent or by design. 

Imagine the colossal traffic Jams 
if the traffic signals ceased working. 
Couple that with snowfall and ice. 
Barges frozen in mid-stream, unable 
to supply coal-powered electric 
plants; coal yards frozen solid; in- 
sufficient electricity to operate the 
pipelines, thus cutting off oil and 
gas; railroads not working; people 
freezing in the dark; trucks not 
working (it takes electricity to get 
the gasoline out of our environmen- 
tally-protected tanks in filling sta- 
tions); goods not moving — but you 
need not imagine it, because it hap- 
pened to some of you, briefly, and 
on a smaller scale. Fortunately the 
nuclear p)ower plants continued to 



operate, and the Great Freeze of ’76 
was essentially local; but it takes no 
great imagination to envision a 
much wider- spread catastrophe, and 
to couple it with deliberate action 
by, say, the authors of The Anar- 
chist's Cookbook, to see how easily 
the nation could be crippleu. 

Temporarily: for now. We have 
vast resources, surpluses, and a re- 
siduum of collective loyalty and 
humanitarianism. Neither of those 
conditions need prevail. Taxes can 
end both, and there are signs they 
are working to that goal as I write 
this. 

But I don’t imagine “the col- 
lapse,” the “knockout blow” that 
Vacca foresees as happening this 
year or next. So far we have a great 
deal of survival-surplus in our sys- 
tem, and it would take no miracles 
to insure against the knockout; but 
the trend is in the other direction. 

Consider. One of the most popu- 
lar political figures in the nation is 
Governor Jerry Brown, who explic- 
itly adopts the “Small Is Beauti- 
ful,” “Only One Earth” philosophy 
of the Appropriate Technology 
movement. But surely, Poumelle, 
the Appropriate Technology move- 
ment is the best insurance against 
the knockout? Making people self- 
sufficient, in small groups, building 
communes, reducing the dependency 
on the system — 

If you believe that you’ll believe 
anything. Leaving out whether it’s 
possible, either physically or politi- 
cally, to insure against disaster by 



ASFO: SOME FUTURES 



83 




inducing large numbers of people to 
be “self-sufficient” (at a convention 
sometime ask Poul Anderson how 
he damned near starved as a kid 
trying to make a living out of a 
forty-acre farm, and ask yourself 
how many forty-acre farms there are 
compared to the number of people 
living in cities), if the Appropriate 
Technology movements succeed, my 
world will vanish because they want 
it to vanish. One of their goals is to 
suppress the kind of technology and 
development I want. They like 
“labor-intensive” industry, as wit- 
ness any of their demonstrations (I 
mentioned last month the Appro- 
priate Technology display of the 
bicycle-pedal-powered mill for grind- 
ing one's wheat to make one's 
bread). 

In fact, we need not envision 
either war or Vacca’s knockout to 
imagine a world in which my vision 
of man’s vast future remains the 
ravings of a science fiction writer. 
Merely continue as we are now: in- 
novative technology discouraged by 
taxes, environmental impact state- 
ments, reports, lawsuits, commis- 
sion hearings, delays, delays, de- 
lays; space research not carried out, 
never officially abandoned but de- 
layed, stretched-out, budgets cut and 
work confined to studies without 
hardware; “solving” the energy 
crisis by conservation, with fusion 
research cut to the bone and 
beyond, continued at level-of-effort 
but never to a practical reactor; fis- 
sion plants never officially banned. 



but no provision made for waste 
disposal or storage so that no new 
plants are built and the operating 
plants slowly are phased out; riots at 
nuclear plant construction sites; 
legal hearings, lawyers, lawyers, 
lawyers . 

Can you not imagine the dream 
being lost? Can you not imagine the 
nation slowly learning to “do with- 
out,” making ‘ 'Smaller is Better” 
the national slogan, fussing over in- 
sulating attics and devoting all our 
attention to windmills; production 
falling, standards of living falling, 
until one day we discover the in- 
vestments needed to go to space 
would be truly costly, would require 
cuts in essentials like food — 

A world slowly settling into 
satisfaction with less, until there are 
no resources to invest in That Buck 
Rogers Stuff? 

I can imagine that. 

I even see trends in that direction. 
Mr. Carter has said no to plu- 
tonium, a decision we could live 
with; and followed that with an 
energy message that in a full hour 
had not one reference to the word 
“fusion,” while out at Livermore 
and Los Alamos they are laying off 
people whose entire professional 
lives have been spent in fusion re- 
search. Our President has told us we 
will have to make sacrifices, but he 
has given us nothing to sacrifice for. 
We shall insulate our attics, but 
mostly we shall use the energy crisis 
as a means for redistributing income 
and increasing taxes and increasing 



84 



GALAXY 




the bureaucracy. (And we shall 
penalize hell out of those who, like 
myself and Poul Anderson, long ago 
insulated and learned to keep our 
automobiles in tune . .) 

Where is the innovation? The im- 
agination? I expected a lot more 
from the President’s energy mes- 
sage. I expected at the very least a 
massive research campaign: a Man- 
hattan Project in agricultural re- 
search to develop plants capable of 
harnessing larger fractions of the 
solar energy falling on them; 
another to develop means for ex- 
tracting energy and fertilizer from 
our sewage and trash; a specific 
plan to insure the safety of nuclear 
power plants while also assuring in- 
vestors that the plants will be built, 
will not be unreasonably delayed by 
perpetual hearings and court chal- 
lenges; perhaps a promise of res- 
toration of some of the funds for fu- 
sion research; more funding for the 
ocean thermal energy system; some- 
thing for the “slow” breeder, which 
uses the uranium-thorium cycle 
and doesn't produce any pluto- 
nium and can't be used to make 
bombs or terror weapons; some- 
thing. Perhaps not all of the above, 
but something. 

Instead we were promised an in- 
come-levelling tax system and told 
to tighten our belts while insulating 
our attics. Make do. Expect less. 
The “spree” is over. There’s only 
one Earth . 

Now look: conservation is not 
going to get us to space. At best 



conservation can save us about half 
what is used for space heating: a 
few years’ growth increase. There’s 
nothing wrong with that, but there’s 
not much right about it either. I hate 
to say this, but the only problem 
with waste is that it’s costly. Sup- 
pose, just suppose for a moment, 
that we suddenly discovered a mil- 
lion years’ worth of fossil fuels. 
Better yet, suppose, just suppose, 
that we really had workable solar- 
power systems of great efficiency 
such that they could supply us 
with all the power we ever 
wanted at trivial costs. Would it be 
worthwhile insulating the attic? 
Obviously not, unless it could be 
shown that an uninsulated attic was 
somehow harmful to the rest of us. 
There’s nothing good per se about 
conservation, and nothing bad per 
se about throwaway cigarette light- 
ers or Cadillacs. It happens that at 
the moment we may not be able to 
afford them and perhaps we’d best 
do without: but surely not-hav- 

ing-Cadillacs is a negative, not 
positive goal? Surely not the only 
possible goal? 

But aren't we going after solar 
power? And won’t that ultimately 
solve all problems? Yes, to both; 
but we won’t get it in lime 
. sorry: we may not get it in 
time. Solar power is risky and ex- 
pensive technology. It is inevitable 
that some form of it will eventually 
power the Earth, but that may take 
far longer than Mr. Carter seems to 
believe.

Freeman Dyson: “In the very 
long run we must have energy that 
is clean and perpetual. We shall 
have solar power. In the long run 
we must have energy that is obtain- 
able and available in large quan- 
tities. We shall have fusion. In the 
near term we must have energy that 
is now available. We have fission 
power. For the present we must 
have energy that is cheap, con- 
venient, and easily obtained. We have 
coal, oil, and natural gas. Nature 
has been kinder to us than we had 
any right to expect.” 

I wish I were that confident; but I 
am not. 

The trends, in my judgment, do 
not augur well for our getting to the 
long run; and trying to skip the near 
term and long run and jump directly 
to the very long run is comparable, 
in my judgment, to Congress order- 
ing Goddard to send a ship to the 
Moon by 1935 or give up those 
crazy rockets. 

It could happen: we could spiral 
down until we have so few surplus 
resources that Roberto Vacca’s 
knockout becomes possible; to a 
point where we have little, and 
many seethe with discontent, and 
suddenly it all explodes in riots, or 
war, or chaos; and when we recover 
from that (some of us) we will find 
that the business of living takes all 
our talents and energies; and our 
grandchildren will curse our mem- 
ories. 

★ ★ ★ 



It doesn’t have to be that way. 
Here is another future. 

First, war. Consider the following 
sequence of events. DeGaulle gives 
China the atom bomb, and when 
asked why says he has done nothing 
that Richelieu didn’t do: when 

threatened with a European enemy, 
aid the Turks (or some other Asian). 
The Soviets begin a new Berlin 
Crisis. The Chinese attack a small 
Soviet island at Ussuri. The Soviets 
back down on Berlin and begin 

moving troops in massive numbers 
toward their eastern frontier. After 

three weeks of buildup they retake 

the island. The Chinese glare at 
them across the river. 

Marshall Gretchko goes to dip- 
lomatic parties and makes dark 
hints. In ten days there may be 
nuclear war. He hopes the West will 
understand. The West makes no re- 
sponse at all. 

The Soviets discover their nuclear 
weapons are very dirty: following 
atomic war with China most of the 
population of Japan may die from 
the fallout. In the U.S. knowledge- 
able people get out their Bendix 
fallout radiometers and dosimeters 
and buy new batteries for them and 
make a few other preparations. 

More Soviet troops move to the 
East, a massive deployment until 
over a hundred divisions are on the 
Chinese border. 

Henry Kissinger takes satellite 
photographs of the Soviet deploy- 
ment to China. Ping-pong teams be- 
gin moving back and forth. Lin 



86 



GALAXY 




Piao, the most dangerous man in 
China, dies in mysterious cir- 
cumstances that may never be 
known to westerners. 

Nixon goes to China. 

It all happened, in that sequence. 
Add this: a "few years later the 
Soviets declassified their fusion re- 
search and brought the bag over 
here in the hopes that we could 
make use of it. (We immediately 
classified what they gave us, putting 
a blanket over the blackboard.) 
Soviet experts privately say their 
need for fusion energy is great; they 
have a lot of development to do. 
They also build a fast breeder fis- 
sion reactor based on US technology 
(we have yet to build one, of 
course). 

Suggestive of what? This much: 
that at least some officials in the 
Soviet Union are now convinced 
that the stniggle with nature has a 
higher payoff potential than con- 
quest; that they couldn’t run China 
when they had it, and can't now; 
that if their system were introduced 
into western Europe (Hungarian 
joke: “The Soviets have crossed a 
cow with a giraffe to produce a 
marvelous animal that feeds in 
Budapest and is milked in Mos- 
cow”) European production would 
not only fall, but the Soviet 
economy would be worse off. 

Give it a couple of generations 
and possibly, just possibly, the di- 
nosaurs will die. It will take skillful 
diplomacy by the West, but it’s pos- 
sible. If we can discourage the di- 



nosaurs until the technicians are in 
control of the Soviet Union, then we 
will have peace. My private opinion 
is that the best way to discourage 
the dinosaurs is to remain so strong 
that they can have no expectation of 
winning — Cato’s advice. “If you 
would have peace, prepare thou then 
for war.” I realize that is not uni- 
versally accepted among the ruling 
elite in the U.S., nor even among 
Galaxy readers. 

But assume the dinosaurs are 
contained, and the trends toward 
cooperation continue. One threat 
contained, anyway. 

Next, the energy crisis. Is Carter 
playing a devious game indeed? To- 
day’s headlines say that there will 
be no special breaks for California: 
we, too, must cease to burn oil 
and natural gas for electricity, despite 
the fact that we cant meet our 
air-quality needs with coal; which 
means that California has no choice 
but to go nuclear (which the people 
of the state, by overwhelming 
majority, opted for in every referen- 
dum ever held here); which means 
that Congress must remove many of 
the legal barriers to getting nuclear 
plants licensed; which means that 
power utilities all over the country 
will again seriously consider the 
nuclear option. Could Carter intend 
that? 

I haven't the foggiest; but it’s one 
scenario that takes us past the 
energy crisis. Then, too, not 
everyone in Congress is a congenital 
moron; there must be someone in 



ASFO: SOME FUTURES

Washington who understands that 
railroads are several times more ef- 
ficient per ton-mile of goods moved 
than trucks (First Law efficiency) 
and that if we (1) deregulated the 
railroads, and (2) charged trucking 
firms the real costs of operation in- 
cluding maintenance of the high- 
ways and a portion of the invest- 
ments sunk into them, we would 
save more petroleum than we could 
save by insulating every attic in the 
nation to a depth of three feet . 

And what the hell, maybe the 
Western States’ senators will get part 
of the fusion research budget re- 
stored. After all. Carter backed 
down on cancelling all those water- 
ways plans, particularly in the states 
like Lousiana whose senators sit on 
powerful committees; and it’s even 
possible ihat someone will ap- 
preciate the need for the research 
without regard to electoral politics. 
Isn’t it? But as I write this they’re 
laying off engineers at Los Alamos. 

Suppose, though, that we get fu- 
sion research so that by 2000 we 
have working reactors. 

Meanwhile, the ocean thermal 
systems I like: at the moment 

they’re getting paper-study money 
only, and although it’s widely an- 
nounced that a demonstration plant 
will be built by 1985 the fact is that 
nothing beyond paper has been 
funded; but suppose the money 
comes to bend tin and cut metal, 
and that a plant is built. It won’t be 
commercial, but from it we should 
learn how to make commercially vi- 



able plants; and we can build re- 
search stations, as described in my 
story “Extreme Prejudice’’ (re- 
printed in my collection High Jus- 
tice, available from Pocket Books). 

Next, let us suppose that either 
through political pressure from such 
groups as the National Space Insti- 
tute (dues $15 a year, $9 for stu- 
dents, 1911 Fort Myer Drive, Ar- 
lington, VA 22209) and the senators 
from California, or through genuine 
insight by our masters, the Shuttle 
program is continued and Enterprise 
actually goes to space; that commer- 
cial firms are given the opportunity 
to rent time in orbit at reasonable 
rates. Profits flow. 

Finally, suppose that either 
through direct government action, or 
through reduced taxes to allow ac- 
cumulation of research and invest- 
ment funds in the private sector, we 
get decent biological technology: 
plants that double their efficiency 
in converting sunlight to usable 
energy. The computer business, al- 
ready leaping ahead, does its thing. 
We inject some rationality into the 
transport system. People are led to 
expect more, not less, and are told 
that if they work a bit harder they 
can have it. 

It’s a possible future. Isn’t it? If 
it’s not, don’t tell me; because I 
want to believe that I have a chnace; 
that I may live to see that world I 
describe in my lectures; that before I 
die I can say, “My generation gave 
mankind the planets and the stars; 
and I was part of it.’’ ★

Nobody likes to be ig 
nored! 



Gideon’s meaix)w was deserted. 
The last paying tourist to set foot on 
the rolling, low-mown grass had left 
in disillusionment some months be- 
fore and now only the crows re- 
mained to play at being ravens. 
They glided darkly from the sur- 
rounding woodland, silent and 
wheeling, sweeping effortless arcs 
across the lea toward the rise in its 
center. They paid little attention to 
the distant clouds glowering in 
shades of grey, ignored the white 
picket fence that surrounded, and 
marked, the knoll. They landed, 
pecked, rose again to the beat of the 
wind. Silent. Ominous. Driving 
farther into the Maryland hills, away 
from the twilight that reminded 
spring of winter. 

But before they went, four men 
stepped out of the trees and paused 
on the edge of the broad open 
space. The tallest and eldest of the 
four glared at the birds, and his 
hands suddenly clenched tightly at 
his sides. His chest swelled, his 
eyes narrowed, and it was a long 
and anxious moment before he 
calmed. 



“Now that is a hell of a view,’’ 
Colonel Feirday said, sneezing into 
an olive drab handkerchief Major 
Simmons shoved into his face. 

“Bless you,’’ the major said, and 
handed the soiled cloth to Captain 
Hawkesworth. 

“There aren’t many places like 
this left anymore,” the captain said. 
“Too much civilization, as the man 
said. Not enough trees. Why, I had 
a dog once — ” 

“As did we all,” General Titus 
Jenkins said, stepping away from 
the others to gaze at the knoll. “As 
did we all. One way or another.” 

The three officers glanced at one 
another, concern for their leader and 
the weather sobering their initial 
holiday spirits. Finally, after re- 
ceiving a few surreptitiously com- 
manding nudges, the captain sidled 
next to the general and cleared his 
throat with a convincing cough. 

“Sir,” he said, almost reverently, 
“you don’t have to do this, you 
know'. What I mean is, we all 
realize what Gideon’s Meadow 
means to you, and we don’t wish to 
intrude on memories so obviously 
painful.” 

“We could have had the stars,” 
the general said. “Right here in this 
damned cow pasture we could have 
had the stars.” 

“And Cynthia,” the major whis- 
pered. 

“Yes,” the colonel said, sniffing. 
“And Cynthia.” 

“Cynthia,” the general said with

problem, and my . loss. But 
mankind, gentlemen, could have 
had the stars!” 

” Perhaps another time,” the 
colonel said pragmatically. 

“Our children, maybe,” said the 
major. “All is not lost, sir. You’ve 
said so yourself many times. All is 
not lost.” 

General Jenkins said nothing. 
From what he heard from his staff, 
he wasn’t at all sure Simmons 
was in any position to spawn, and 
he knew for a fact that Feirday’s 
wife had vanished with a Quarter- 
master Brigadier not two years ago. 
The rumors that she had been 
soft-soaped by promises of riches 
did not sway him. No, neither the 
colonel nor the major would ever 
produce progeny — but the thoughts 
were what counted, sincere and de- 
termined; and if he had anything to 
say about it (despite the National 
Security and Reclamation Act), the 
world would long and damned well 
remember what it had lost, perhaps 
permanently, a decade before. But 
only, he reminded himself, perhaps. 
He shook himself, and then, sup- 
ported by the captain’s arm, ad- 
vanced across the meadow toward 
the white picket fence. 

“Where shall I begin?” he 
mused. “So many things, so many 
dates.” 

“The spaceship,” the coloiiel 
prompted. 

“Cynthia,” the major suggested, 
coughed, and changed it to “the 
music.” 



The captain tripped over a 
molehill, and the general held him 
until he regained his balance. 

“The President,” he said firmly. 
“I recall vividly it was the President 
who called me that morning. He 
was rather agitated. Blathered 
something about trespass and viola- 
tions and matter of that nature. I as- 
sured him my subordinates could 
handle such routine nonsense, but 
he insisted on having me or no one 
at all. I could see from the vione 
screen that he was still in his 
pyjamas. Little furry creatures run- 
ning over his chest. I knew then he 
was bloody angry. He never lets 
anyone see his pyjamas. And he 
kept insisting I had to handle the 
situation for him.” 

“Foresight,” the colonel said, 
searching the grass for signs of 
cows. 

“Prescience,” the major submit- 
ted as he watched gloomily while 
his spitshine faded. 

“Luck,” the general said. “I was 
between sensitive assignments and 
free of command. 1 agreed, of 
course, even though it was a miser- 
ably hot day, humid and all that. It 
was a Saturday in June and my old 
Fleetwood Turbine was acting up 
something fierce, so I had to suffer 
a ride in one of those blowhard 
hoverthings. Dreadfully dusty, if I 
recall, but damned smooth no matter 
what the road was like. We, my 
aides and I, arrived precisely here 
just before noon. In fact, we took 
the same trail — if you can call it

that — that you and I did today. 

“And there it was, gentlemen. 
Bold as brass and twice as bright. 
An incredibly beautiful machine, 
and completely incongruous in this 
bucolic setting. A party of advance 
chipmunks was trying to establish 
relations, as I recall. Suspected it 
was one hell of a nut, no doubt.” 

He laughed wheezily, and the 
others joined him until he shook his 
head sharply and they stopped as if 
choked. He grinned and covered it 
with a thin-fmgered hand. Then he 
reached down to pluck a lonely 
daisy, spinning the crown until the 
petals blurred. 

“It was approximately eighty-six 
meters in diameter, shaped very 
much like a slightly flattened egg. 
There were no ports that I could 
see, no exits; it rested solidly on its 
base. Unless, of course, it had 
landed upside down — but we natur- 
ally had no way of telling. A for- 
bidding sight, ni grant you, but in- 
triguing nevertheless. The local 
police had at least had the profes- 
sionalism to post a guard to keep 
snoopers away, and I immediately 
ordered them replaced with military 
observers. Once the pictures were 
taken, wc .set up a headquarters tent 
over there by that gopher hole. 
Comlinks, staff, decanters of brac- 
ers .. rugged, but comfortable. 

“Our initial speculations centered 
around our friends and co-existers, 
believing it entirely possible that one 
of their aircraft was missing on a 
routine espionage flight. No luck 



there, however. After we had 
checked through our own files in the 
basement, we concluded that what 
we had almost in our hands was the 
first tangible proof that there was, 
in fact, interstellar flight. And after 
we’d double-checked our Lunar 
radar scans, I no longer doubted.” 

“History had been made,” the 
colonel said. 

“But what about Cynthia?” the 
captain asked. 

“Well, I don’t blame you for 
doubting,” the major said loudly. 

“I never doubted,” the general 
corrected himself. 

“1 told you he didn’t,” the 
colonel said, and rested a hand gin- 
gerly on the fence, leaning forward 
as if his staring would bring back 
the scene that morning. 

“First crack,” the general con- 
tinued, “went to the scientist types 
who worked night and day for 
weeks to breach that devil’s univer- 
sal secrets. They had conferences 
and symposia, workshops and 
brainstorms, used up more time on 
the computers than France did on 
the Germans. Weeks. 

“But that thing, that alien 
machine, did nothing to aid us. It 
just squatted there. 

“It was exceedingly, damnably, 
frustrating, gentlemen. We tried 
bombarding it with every known 
radio wave in the spectrum, then 
twiddled the dials to mix things up a 
bit in case we were missing a bet. 
We rapped on it, used lasers to bum 
it, chisels to chip it, acids to eat it. 



92 



GALAXY 




Nothing. Why, right over there by 
that willow is the exact spot where 
Dr. Poltcr set up his ten-meter 
screen to flash pictures at it, in case 
someone was w atching. Mathematical 
equations, celestial maps, formulae, 
anything af all to get a rise out of 
that sneaky, secretive thing. But 
none of it worked. There was no re- 
sponse, none at all, and a few of the 
boys were literally tearing out their 
hair in desperation. Frankly, we 
didn’t have a clue as to why the hell 
they were here at all!” 

“Invasion, of course,” the 
colonel said. 

“Cultural shock,” the major 
judged. 

Captain Hawkesworth’s uncle, 
attached to a defunct CBR unit at 
the time, had suggested to the press 
that the Army and the Government 
combine forces to set up a turnstile 
and souvenier booth, and sell tickets. 
With a few artful spotlights and a 
shill or two, he’d said, we could 
ease the imbalance of payments, 
then sell the thing to the movies on 
an option/cost basis. Though his 
enthusiasm for the capitalistic pro- 
cess was applauded in Congress, he 
was quietly transferred to a base in 
Idaho where he died ten months la- 
ter of starch inhalation. 

Hawkesworth, therefore, said 
nothing. 

“Invasion, cultural shock, xeno- 
phobia,” the general listed. “We 
considered all of these and more. 
But what use were speculations 
when there was nothing we could do 



to breach the walls of silence that 
encircled that spectral device? Fi- 
nally, five months after its discov- 
ery, the President instructed me to 
forsake the normal paths of discus- 
sion and experimentation and get 
some kind of response from that 
goddamned thing. I agreed readily. 
It was but my duty, and I hated re- 
calcitrant and alien problems. 

“So 1 began to read, widely and 
wildly, immersing myself in 
psychologies and anthropologies. I 
spent hours alone here just thinking, 
wandering, wondering how in hell 
you talked to a piece of egg-shaped 
metal. I conferred with astronomers 
and astrologists, writers and artists, 
and all I could come up with was 
that we had a problem. Great. A 
bloody damned spaceship in the 
middle of this meadow, and the 
greatest minds in the world could 
only tell me we had a problem. 

“But, gentlemen, I was deter- 
mined. Steadfast. And finally, by 
the following July, I was ready. 
Yes, I know it sounds immodest, 
but I was truly ready, as ready as I 
and the world would ever be to 
storm that mighty citadel. Dramatic? 
Perhaps. Only time would tell.” 

A sudden gust of wind made him 
squint, turn his head back to the 
woods he’d just left. When the air 
calmed, he motioned to the others 
and they sat on the ground, their 
backs to the knoll. Clouds hovered. 
The colonel reached into a breast 
pocket and pulled out a vari-colored 
slick brochure his command had 



GENTLE RAPPING 



93 




prepared when the Secretary of De- 
fense ordered mobilization of op- 
portunity — if the aliens wouldn’t 
talk, we might as well sell tickets. 

The general saw the brochure 
being passed to the captain. He 
frowned. 

“Hawkes worth has been through 
a lot, too, sir,” the colonel said 
timidly. “His uncle . well, sir, I 
thought he’d like to have a sou- 
venier. Just so he’ll know his family 
was vindicated.” 

“Ah yes,” the general said, and 
smiled at the younger man. “I re- 
member your uncle, Hawkesworth. 
He saved my life once. On the 
Moon. A good man. A little heavy, 
but a good man.” 

“Thank you, sir,” the captain 
whispered, and brushed a hand 
across his eyes. 

Then, over the distant hills, a 
cannonade. The wind grew colder. 

“There were four of us,” the 
general said in a somber voice. 
“Vic Jennings, Jake Holmes, my- 
self, and . Major Duncan.” 

“Cynthia,” the colonel breathed, 
and sneezed. 

“Careful, sir,” the major said. 

“Sir, please ...” the captain 
said worriedly. 

“It’s all right,” the general said, 
swallowing gamely. “The Major 
and 1 were comrades- in-arms, as 
well as close friends. A slight wom- 
an she was, not as much meat as I 
would have liked, but nevertheless a 
proud and strong person. We talked 
quite a bit, dear Cynthia and I, as 



we walked about the spaceship, 
prodding and probing until our 
brains grew weary. We used the 
night for cover, of course, and very 
often would lie on the grass with 
chins in hand, simply staring at that 
hulking beast. I once suggested, in 
an entirely professional manner, of 
course, that she tear off her uniform 
in the appliance of her duty and en- 
tice the aliens out with a bit of tan- 
talization. I remember ... I re- 
member how she laughed — the cruel 
would say she brayed — and called 
my bluff. It was an intriguing sight, 
gentlemen, that WAC major pranc- 
ing about quite literally out of uni- 
form. But to no avail, no avail.” 
His eyes lost their focus, then, and 
the captain looked to the others, who 
only shook their heads solemnly and 
crossed their legs to wait for more. 
“No avail, as I said. A game girl 
she was and knew where her duty, 
er, lay. And so it was that come the 
next dawn we assembled the rest of 
the team, leaving frivolity behind, 
and throughout that long winter we 
worked our bloody asses off until 
we were ready to strangle each 
other. If it hadn’t been for 
Cynth — Major Duncan, our sanity 
would not have lasted beyond the 
first week. 

“We argued, we fought, stalked 
out and came back. And then we 
were ready, as ready as we would 
ever be. Auspicious. It was the 
Fourth of July. Cynthia’s birthday. 
The area here was cleared com- 
pletely, and at first light we moved 



94 



GALAXY 




to the treeline. The spacecraft was 
alone, glinting feverishly in the 
dawn’s early light. We smiled, then, 
because a crow sat atop it preening, 
and 1 whispered to the others that 
we had ourselves a sign, an augury, 
feathers for our caps. We were dres- 
sed in the latest camouflage garb, 
with packs on our shoulders. And 
Jake carried the laser — we were 
taking no chances that day, no 
chances at all. 

“Yet, we had our orders, and 
sensible ones they were: don’t start 
anything the world couldn’t handle. 

“At a nod from me we positioned 
ourselves at the four major points of 
the compass, ten meters distant from 
the ship, connected tenuously by a 
comlink pinned to our lapels. The 
plan called for vocal bombardments 
beginning precisely at 0622, moving 
on to physical assaults fourteen 
minutes later, and concluding with 
visual tactics at exactly 0700. By 
that time, gentlemen, we would 
have exhausted our first line of 
offense. Next would come the final 
solution.’’ 

“Brilliant,” said Feirday, squirm- 
ing. 

“I love it,” the major said, 
watching the approaching storm. 

“But it was fated otherwise, 
wasn’t it, sir?” the captain dared, 
and was kicked in the ankle by the 
anxious major. 

The general nodded and began 
plucking petals from his daisy. 
“Fate it was, Hawkes worth, or 
perhaps the sheer perversity of the 



universe. At any rate, at the ap- 
pointed time Jennings, with the aid 
of a clever adaptation of a larynx 
modulator, commenced the Gettys- 
burg Address; Cynthia whipped out 
her subtonic jew’s harp and played 
her way down the Ohio; Holmes 
gloomed through Dostoevski; and 
I . well, as my Air Force in- 
feriors would have it, I winged it. 
Having no special artistic skills to 
draw on, I had planned to whistle, 
but when a soldier ant found clever 
access to my shin, I just cursed a 
lot — a good trooper always knows 
when to be flexible, you understand. 

“The physical assault commenced 
all too soon for my wearied nerves, 
yet we moved right into it without a 
hitch. That alien bastard knew his 
stuff, however, and once again we 
were stymied. Holmes’ laser made 
attractive but short-lived designs; 
Jennings’ fast-ball rocks merely 
bounced to the ground like bloated 
pebbles; Cynthia’s finely-tuned darts 
were blunted, and my faithful au- 
tomatic simply grew too hot to 
handle. It was, as some bald king 
once said, a puzzlement. But we 
were not daunted, nor were we de- 
terred. Instantly we launched into 
Phase Three: I skipped over to Jen- 
nings who cartwheeled magnifi- 
cently to Cynthia who backpedaled 
skillfully to Holmes who delicately 
but manfully pirouetted to me. And 
round and round we went until the 
appointed 0700.” 

“Nice try,” Feirday said, 
squashing a spider. 



GENTLE RAPPING 



95 




“It was, it was. And the thinking 
was truly elementary. And, I con- 
fess for the first time, mostly a prod- 
uct of Cynthia’s willing to gambol. 
It was so obvious that we all, save 
for her, had overlooked it: if what 
we had was an actual alien thing, 
then all the knowledge in the world 
would not be able to penetrate that 
‘saucer.’ After all, if we couldn’t 
understand our own passions and 
prejudices, our own kind com- 
pletely, how the devil could we 
honestly expect to understand 
something we couldn’t even under- 
stand? Clever though the scientists 
and other Services might have been, 
they knew too much — and by 
knowing, knew nothing. Thus, she 
reasoned, we must not act intelli- 
gently at all, but rather in a random 
fashion most amenable to confusion. 
Confusion would confound. Con- 
foundedness would produce curios- 
ity, and curiosity, as we all know, 
leads to discovery. 

“It hasn’t been told until today, 
my friends, but I actually had very 
little hope for the initial phases of 
our assault. 1 considered it more of 
a warm-up, a batting of the plank 
over the Jackass’s head. So to 
speak. And no disrespect. We were 
merely readying ourselves for the 
main attraction.’’ 

“Which was?’’ the major asked, 
holding up a palm to test for rain. 

“Nothing.’’ 

They applauded. 

“That’s right, gentlemen. Noth- 
ing. Nothing at all. Look at it this 

96 



way, if you will: we’d been sur- 
rounding and pounding on that 
miserable chunk of space garbage 
for over a year. People crawling all 
over it, talking to it, praying over it, 
selling tickets to it. Constant pur- 
poseful activity. But purposeful only 
to us! Suppose the devils inside 
could not make heads or tails of it? 
Suppose they were scratching their 
collective crania and thinking they 
had landed in Nebraska or some- 
thing? This, they might well have 
been thinking, is what we traveled 
X number of light-years for? 

“So. The four of us stood there. 
Simply stood there at attention. As 
if The Man himself was coming to 
inspect us from pate to toenails. 

“Noon came and went. Midafter- 
noon, and the sun was brutishly hot. 
Various insects feasted on our faces’ 
salt deposits. I amused myself by 
reciting the Manual of Arms, kept 
my vision clear by staring at that 
crow still on the saucer. A breeze 
succored us momentarily. A robin 
considered nesting on Cynthia. And 
as night began to fall, dew formed 
on our epaulets. 

“Even then my knees weren’t 
what they used to be, 1 can assure 
you; I was proud of myself at that 
moment when the moon came over 
the mountains. Damned proud! The 
tiny tubes snaking from my pack 
into my mouth provided me with 
suitable nourishment, the other tubes 
trailing behind me provided ad- 
equate egress, and only an occa- 
sional passing wind broke through 



GALAXY 




the meadow’s silence. And through 
all this, I was proud because I knew 
we would win! We were about to 
make first contact with the first 
naturally intelligent race our kind 
had ever come across. Why they 
picked our nation we may never 
know. The luck of the draw, atmos- 
pheric conditions, density of popu- 
lation centers . who knows? But 
they were here! 

He stood suddenly, throwing the 
others off-balance. Quickly, they 
scrambled to their feet and followed 
as the general swung his legs over 
the low fence and strode to the top 
of the knoll. The colonel, sensing 
something dramatic, held the others 
back, and they waited, watching as 
the general solemnly paced the area 
once occupied by an alien craft. A 
moment later he snapped a finger to 
his thin mustache and doffed his 
hat, tucking it under his left arm 
and folding his hands before him. 

“It was here, gentlemen, where I 
now stand. And it was here that 
we . .no, that I, and I alone, lost 
the battle, and my WAC Cynthia.” 

The colonel bowed his head. 

The major repressed a sigh. 

The captain sniffed once and 
stared at the imposing frail figure 
elegantly backlighted by the thun- 
derheads massing above them. The 
ever- rising wind tore at the general’s 
greying hair, whipped at the tails of 
his uniform tunic. 

“We had specially prepared 
braces,” he said, his voice lifting to 
be heard over the gathering storm. 



“They supported our legs when the 
going got rough. I had been in 
many a parade ground ceremony 
before, but nothing like this had 
ever tested me so.” 

He swallowed and licked at his 
lips. “I remember it all too well. It 
was coming on four when suddenly 
a persistent tapping flickered across 
the meadow. At first I thought it 
was my stomach protesting its fluid 
diet, but when 1 felt the ground 
trembling ever-so-Iightly beneath 
my feet 1 knew . / knew we had 
done it! We had confounded the 
stellar denizens, had spurred their 
appetites for the accumulation of 
our knowledge. Somewhere within 
that slip of a ship a gear was re- 
volving, a widget sprocketing, a 
footstep (or whatever) pounding. 
Soon, I thought, a door would open 
and the planet would be united in 
frenzied celebration of cosmic con- 
nection finally achieved. 

“The tapping grew louder. 

“I grew impatient. And there’s 
no getting around it now, gentle- 
men: it was I who blew the fuse on 
your celestial light. 

“Me, and that goddamned crow. 

“A small aperture opened directly 
in front of me, about five meters 
above the outer rim of the ship. At 
first I thought it was a trick of the 
dawn’s dim light; but soon enough it 
opened to form what I guessed was 
what they used for a door. Rigid, 
old man, I told myself; stay rigid 
until the time is right. And I did. 
Chin up, chest out, tubes quiet. I

dearly wanted to shout for joy, for 
delirium, for ecstasy, but my train- 
ing reined me in. Instead, I 
watched, judged, waited and was 
ready to make the first move as 
befitted my rank toward the 
. the . 

“Courage, sir,” the colonel 
whispered. 

“Courage,” the major echoed. 

“Give ’em hell, Harry,” the 
captain said, and shrugged when the 
others glared at him. 

The general slowly unfolded his 
hands. 

“Most of all,” he said at last, as 
lightning ozoned the air, “I wanted 
to have Cynthia with me, by me, to 
hear her gasps of delight as she was 
proved right. I . I . .” 

“Easy, sir,” they muttered in 
unison. 

“It flew directly in front of my 
eyes, obscuring that historic moment 
but for an instant; but so angry was 
1 that I flicked my eyes to follow its 
flight, flicked them back quickly 
when it soared overhead, returned 
and perched on my shoulder. Not to 
worry, Titus, I ordered myself; be 
as a rock or, in this case, a redwood 
limb. But that bird began croaking 
and picking at its tail feathers. 1 
couldn’t help it, gentlemen. When it 
twisted its head about, one wing 
brushed over my face. 

“No matter what is said a 
hundred years from now, there’s no 
other explanation for it. 

“I sneezed. 

“Instantly, the tapping became a 



rumbling, a grumbling that grew to 
a crescendo, and an interstellar light 
flared forth from that ship’s alien 
maw. I wanted to step away, but 
my braces had locked. Locked, 
dammit, and I was beginning to tilt. 
Slowly, inexorably, tilting back- 
ward until gravity defeated me and 
1 was lying helpless on my back. 
Staring at the sky. At the spaceship 
rising rapidly toward the clouds. 
Not the smoothest take-off I’d ever 
seen — nothing to cheer about, any- 
way — but when I twisted my head 
around, my heart soared into my 
throat. I was alone. Jennings, 
Holmes . even my darling Cyn- 
thia ... all gone.” 

Lightning flashed then, and the 
sky shattered in thunder. 

“They were up there,” the gen- 
eral said, pointing skyward. “Taken 
by the aliens and spirited into space. 
And I ... I was a failure. Left be- 
hind to explain to the world why I 
was grounded by a goddamned 
crow.” 

He walked down the knoll and 
climbed over the fence. The others 
trailed behind him, and they said 
nothing until they had reached the 
treeline. 

“They said you sacrificed your 
own chances for glory,” the colonel 
offered. 

“I heard the speeches; they 
praised your unselfishness,” the 
major said softly. 

“It was a brilliant plan,” Haw- 
kesworth said. “It was brilliant, and 
it worked, sir. And you have cer-

tainly given your lovely Major Dun- 
can her due. Tm sure, sir, that your 
subsequent meditations have discov- 
ered that the poet had a word for 
it, a word of solace for you.” 
“Right,” the colonel said briskly. 
“Tintinnabulation, wasn’t it?” 
“Ulalume,” the major corrected. 
The general shrugged and gazed 
back at Gideon’s Meadow. 

“She’ll returi>,” he said finally. 
“And they will, too. They’ll bring 
with them knowledge for us. 
Something, I don’t know what, to 
free us from the plagues that beset 
our children. I shan’t ... I shan’t 
be here to see it, I expect. But I 
think you will. Captain. Damn me if 
I know why, but I think you’ll be 
around when the aliens bring my 



Cynthia back. 

“But meanwhile, for the record, 
it’s sufficient to know that we are 
not the only ones stranded in the 
universe: I have that much at least 
to comfort myself with when I re- 
member. That, and a slightly used 
oak leaf.” 

He turned abruptly and stalked 
into the woods. Stopped. Made a 
smart about-face and smiled ruefully 
at his men. 

“Sir?” the colonel said. 

“You have something to add?” 
the major said. 

“Captain,” the general said, 
“you’re a qualified Ranger, are you 
not? Do you think you could get us 
all back to the highway? My map’s 
in the car. I think I’m lost.” ★

Clem Bunker walked up the 
empty ditch to the cutoff. 

The EPA man was waiting by the 
headgate. Sheriff Scatt was standing 
next to the government agent. The 
EPA agent was holding up a lock 



with a government seal. The lock 
had been cut. 

“Mr. Bunker, do you know any- 
thing about this defacement of 
government property?” 

“It does look defaced,” admitted 
Clem. 

Agent Weisil sighed. “Mr. 
Bunker, EPA has determined that 
further irrigation of your land will 
increase the salinity of the run-off 
past the permissible return level. 
You were informed of this. You 
appealed, and the appeal was de- 
nied. Congress passed the law, and 
you were in violation of that law.” 
“Takes water to grow beets,” 
noted Clem. “Congress can’t pass 
laws to stop that.” 

“Mr. Bunker, since you have 
persisted in diverting water il- 
legally — ” 

“Wasn’t illegal,” interrupted 
Clem. “Family's owned the water 
rights for over a hundred years.” 
“Since you diverted water in vio- 
lation of the Clean Water Act 
Amendments, EPA obtained a court 
order to prohibit further diversion.” 
Agent Weisil held up the severed 
lock. “But you seem to have taken 
the law into your own hands. If you 
persist, I will be forced to have the 
Sheriff enforce the restraining order 
I have obtained, which will result in 
your — ” 

“Okay, okay. I won’t add my 
teensy bit of run-off salt. How am 1 
supposed to grow beets?” 

“Perhaps you ought to take that 
up with your Congressman, since

Congress passed the law,” sug- 
gested the EPA agent. 

“Maybe I will,” said Clem. 
“Maybe I will.” 

The farmer turned to the lawman. 
“Zack, who’s our Congressman?” 

“Spielman,” spat the Sheriff. 

Bunker leaned back against the 
old cottonwood and watched the 
EPA agent lock the headgate shut 
with another shiny government 
lock. He looked down the length of 
the empty ditch and at the beet tops 
drying in the sun. 

“Maybe I will,” he muttered. 
“Spielman.”

The afternoon sun lightened the 
dim room. 

“Corey, you can’t do it. It’s 
political suicide.” A1 Gaston rubbed 
his hands together. 

“What am I supposed to do, Al? 
Lx)se?” Corey looked at his cam- 
paign manager. “Spielman and I 
get the same 'amount of money from 
the EEC. Except he’s been mailing 
a newsletter a week to the entire 
district for the past ten years. You 
know what that costs just in post- 
age? One hundred thousand dollars 
a year! And the taxpayers pick it 
up.” 

“Corey. .he hasn’t sent any 
during the campaign.” 

“Oh. .1 forgot. For five weeks 
every other year he stops.” 

“Bitterness won’t beat Spiel- 
man,” protested Gaston.

“Al, it’s three weeks before the 
general election. The polls say that 
eighty-eight percent of the voters 
have made up their mind, and I’m 
going to lose by twenty percent. 
That’s what I’ve gotten from our in- 
tensive, gentlemanly campaign. If I 
keep it up, I can increase the mar- 
gin of defeat to twenty-five percent.” 

Gaston picked up a print-out and 
waved it in Corey’s face. “Now 
you listen to me. You know why no 
one wages a personal campaign any 
more? Because they lose! In the last 
ten years, not one personal cam- 
paign, not one muckraking, sling- 
it-at-the-incumbent challenger has 
won!” He threw the computer 
statistics on the desk. 

“Al, I don’t care. There’s no 
way I can win doing what we’re do- 
ing. I’m going to make sure every 
voter in the Sixth District knows ev- 
erything about Joe Spielman, every 
rotten vote, every promise. .every- 
thing!” 

“Corey, Spielman ’s not a bum. 
He’s honest. He’s never done any- 
thing illegal.” 

“Is promising one thing and vot- 
ing the opposite honest? Is saying 
you believe in freedom and enacting 
more and more regulations honest?” 
Corey stopped and looked out the 
dingy window at the setting sun. He 
could hear the volunteers in the next 
room stuffing and sealing the end- 
less mailings. 

“Corey, Corey. .you’re crazy. 
You’re mad.” 

“Damned right I’m mad. I’m

mad. I’m sick and tired of Spielman 
conning the people, and I’m sick 
and tired of a izovernment elected 
by less and less of the people. What 
was it? Thirty percent voted in the 
last Presidential election?” He 
leaned against the desk, resting his 
hand on the vidfax. 

Gaston put his hands on his hips 
and stared at the candidate. “So 
don’t blame me. ’’ 

Corey looked back. Then he 
grinned. Finally he laughed. 
“Hell. .we’re all to blame. But 
we’re going to have some fun for 
the rest of the campaign.’’

The car was cold. Plaudder strap- 
ped himself in, turned the ignition 
switch on. Then he watched the 
Comp-Meter light up. It flashed 
four digits. Plaudder responded by 
tapping four keys. The Comp-Meter 
flashed green. 

Plaudder turned the key. The en- 
gine turned over, but did not catch. 
Plaudder kept the key turned. 

The engine coughed once and re- 
sumed its dry cranking. 

The environmental interlock cut 
in and turned off the electrical sys- 
tem. Plaudder looked slowly from 
the ignition switch to the dashboard 
instruments, still holding the key in 
the start position. The purple 
“ENV” light was lit. 

“Oh hell,’’ muttered Plaudder. 

He turned off the ignition switch 
and rebelted the seatbelts. He didn’t 



want to try another start with the 
belt buzzer sounding in his ears. He 
counted slowly to twenty. 

Then he turned the ignition 
switch again and waited for the 
Comp-Meter sequence. He repeated 
the four digits the box flashed at 
him. The green light came on. He 
turned the key and held it. 

The engine began to crank. It 
coughed twice before the “ENV’’ 
light blinked on the dashboard and 
the power to the electrical system 
was cut. 

Plaudder turned off the ignition, 
rebelted himself, counted to twenty, 
reproved his mental competency 
with the Comp-Meter, and tried to 
start the car again. 

The car’s attempts to catch were 
cut short by the environmental 
monitor. 

“God damn it!’’ 

Still. .the car sounded almost 
ready to start, if only that environ- 
mental monster would let it. 

Plaudder switched the ignition 
off, unfastened and refastened the 
seatbelts, and waited for the 
Comp-Meter. He jabbed out the 
numbers hurriedly. The Comp- 
Meter glared red and turned off the 
electrical system. 

“Damn you, you rotten hunk of 
tin!” 

Plaudder took three deep breaths, 
unfastened the seatbelts, and got out 
of the car. 

Maybe he should have gotten an 
electroscooter. Diane would have. 

His breath was white, even in the 



CAME THE REVOLUTION

shelter of the carport. He looked up 
toward Wisteria where the Express 
Bus was due in fifteen minutes. The 
streets were still icy. Five or six 
people were walking up the hill 
with tentative steps, heading toward 
the bus stop. Most of the newer 
cars were parked in the street, or in 
driveways. 

“That should be enough,” grum- 
bled Plaudder. He got back in the 
car, fastened the seatbelts, and 
turned the ignition switch. The 
Comp-Meter pulsed its four random 
numbers on the display screen. 
Plaudder repeated them on the small 
keyboard. .deliberately. 

The Comp-Meter momentarily 
flashed amber, then settled into a 
green approval. 

“You’d better, you damn number 
box,” cursed Plaudder. His toes 
were getting numb. 

He turned the key. The engine 
turned over. It coughed half a dozen 
times before it slowed. It stopped 
abruptly as the purple “ENV” light 
flashed on the dashboard. 

“You miserable bastard!” 
screamed Plaudder as he hammered 
his fist on the horn button. 

He peered out the frosted side 
window. He sighed. He gave the 
inert horn one last thump and 
picked up his lunchcase. He 
climbed out and slammed the car 
door. 

He began the cold walk up the 
hill to the Express Bus stop.

Jim Westnor stared at the inspec- 
tor. 

“That’s right,” repeated the 
man. “This railing has to go. The 
carcasses will rub against it. That’s 
contamination.” 

“But we installed the railing be- 
cause the ESA inspector required 
it.” 

“Look,” responded the Ag In- 
spector. “I don’t care what the 
Federal Safety Inspector said. If this 
railing doesn’t go, you don’t ship 
meat. I’ll be back tomorrow.” 

Westnor stalked into the plant, 
straight for his office. He sat down 
at the desk and tapped out a number 
on the vidfax. 

“FSA, Mr. Hoagwast’s office,” 
whined the strained blond recep- 
tionist. He had his hair in the elabo- 
rate neo-Roman style. 

“Jim Westnor, Westside Meat 
Packing. I’d like to talk to Mr. 
Hoagwast.” 

“Just a moment, sir.” 

Westnor tapped his fingers on the 
desk and stared at the FSA logo on 
the screen. The logo faded into the 
image of a thin, graying man. 

“Hoagwast here.” 

“I’m Jim Westnor of Westside 
Meat Packing. Last week you gave 
us a citation for failing to have a 
safety railing on our loading dock.” 

“What’s the problem? As I re- 
call, you had it installed when I 
made my follow-up check yester- 
day.” 

“Today we got inspected by the 
USDA meat inspector. He says that 



104 



GALAXY 




the Department of Agriculture regs 
prohibit railings. We’re supposed to 
take it down.” 

Hoagwast shook his head slowly. 
”1 can certainly sympathize with 
your problem, Mr. Westside. But I 
don’t have any latitude. The regula- 
tions say that you must have a 
safety railing. I can’t make an ex- 
ception just for Westnor Meat Pack- 
ing. The regulations say that I must 
issue a notice of unsafe procedures 
if you do not have a safety 
railing — ” 

“And that closes me down,” in- 
terrupted Westnor. “But if I don’t 
remove the damned railing, the 
USDA closes me down as unsani- 
tary. No matter what I do, it’s il- 
legal.” 

“I can certainly understand your 
confusion, Mr. Westland, but the 
way Congress wrote the law was 
very explicit, and I don’t have any 
choice.” 

Westnor snapped off the vidfax 
and sat at his desk, still tapping his 
fingers. 

Finally he tapped out another 
number. 

“Gus, can you modify that safety 
railing on the dock so it looks per- 
manent, but so it can be taken down 
in about a minute?” 

“Sure, boss, but why?” 

“Because the damned Congress 
and the damned bureaucrats have 
said it’s got to be both up and down 
at the same time. That’s why.” 

Westnor began to sift through the 
papers on his desk.

Corey pulled off his gloves and 
twisted them in his hands. The Oc- 
tober wind was cold, especially in 
the open lot outside the stadium. 

People were starting to drive up 
and get out of their cars and scoot- 
ers. Corey put the gloves in his 
pocket and picked up a thin stack of 
his fliers. 

“Hello, I’m Corey Grademan. 
I’m running for Congress.” Corey 
handed the woman a flier. “I’d sure 
appreciate it if you’d read this and 
vote for me.” 

The woman smiled pleasantly. 
“Well, I’ll read your brochure, but 
I can tell you. I’m going to vote for 
Joe Spielman.” 

“What can I do to change your 
mind?” 

“Probably nothing. If Joe can’t 
change things in Washington after 
all the years he’s tried, I don’t see 
how you can.” 

Corey watched her drop his leaf- 
let in the nearest trash barrel.

The balding professor pointed to 
the blackboard. 

“I realize this is old-fashioned. I 
could flash cue cards or slides in 
multicolor, but in my old-fashioned 
way, I am about to make an old- 
fashioned point. Mr. Wheeler 
. .yes, you, 1 would appreciate it 
greatly if you would stay awake 
long enough to hear me out.”

He took the long pointer and jab- 
bed it at the letters chalked on the 
board. On one side were three large 
F’s, on the other side, three large 
B’s. 

“Any government in history has 
been selected, if you will, by the 
three F’s, or if you prefer. .the 
three B’s.’’ 

The professor smiled. 

“Most of you haven’t the faintest 
idea what I’m talking about. But let 
us proceed. The three F’s stand for 
Fraud, Force, and Franchise.’’ 

He turned back toward the class. 

“Mr. Wheeler, I’ll ask you 
first. .so you can drop off. What 
do I mean by Fraud, Force, and 
Franchise?’’ 

Wheeler looked blank. He stam- 
mered, “Well, eh. .1 guess, 
maybe some governments are cor- 
rupt, and some are run by 
force. .’’ 

“Not bad. .but government by 
fraud may not be corrupt, depend- 
ing on the definitions. Mr. Bryan,’’ 
asked the professor, “what about 
Franchise?’’ 

“Some sort of privilege. .only 
some folks get to make up govern- 
ment?’’ 

“With your name, Mr. William 
Bryan, I would have expected 
better.” 

The professor returned to the 
podium. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, the first 
and most important definition of 
Franchise is the right of suffrage, 
the right to vote. Now,” and the 



professor gestured around the hall, 
“when less than thirty percent of 
the adult population votes, is the 
question of Franchise more or less 
important? Why?” 

He smiled again. 

“I’m going to let you think about 
that question. You may have it on 
an exam. You may not.” 

He Jabbed the pointer at the three 
B’s. 

“If you prefer B’s, then cite 
Bribery, Bullets, and Ballots. In our 
history, the use of bullets, except 
during the Civil War, has been 
restricted and minimal compared to 
most other governments. On the 
other hand. Bribery, Fraud, if you 
will, has played a far more perva- 
sive role than the most cynical of 
you realize. 

“Laidwin, answer this. Is it 
Bribery for non-partisan political 
groups to use their rightful and legal 
methods of changing public opinion 
to influence the course of legislation 
and to create rules and regulations 
of which the majority does not ap- 
prove?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Laidwin, you’re a fine young 
man. You’re legally correct. Are 
you morally correct? And more im- 
portant, are you politically correct? 
No. .1 don’t want an answer now. 

“I will leave you all with one 
more question. What happens to a 
society where a minority , or a series 
of minorities, uses its influence to 
Bribe changes in the societal 
framework which will not and can-

not be accepted by the majority?” 

The professor nodded his head at 
the class. “Good day, ladies and 
gentlemen.” 

Corey looked around the crowd, 
cleared his throat. 

“Friends,” started Corey, “all 
the political books say that you 
can’t win an election by getting per- 
sonal. All the books say you must 
be nice to your opponent. .even if 
he or she is the biggest hypocrite in 
Congress. All the books say you 
have to come up with a positive ap- 
proach. 

“I’m telling you here tonight that 
I’m throwing the books away. I’ve 
spent the last year walking through 
the Sixth District, listening to you, 
and to people like you. 

“What have you said? You’re fed 
up with more and more rules, more 
and more government studies that 
say nothing, more and more taxes. 

“You’re tired of products that 
don’t work. You can’t find doctors. 
You can’t find mechanics. Your 
kids aren’t learning. 

“Who’s to blame? 

“Why, Honest Joe Spielman’s to 
blame. That’s who! Here’s why. 

“Honest Joe Spielman voted for 
more controls on your car. All those 
monitors and gadgets? That’s right. 
Honest Joe Spielman voted for 
them. 

“Honest Joe Spielman voted for 
all those rules that mean your kids 



can’t get Jobs. With a ten-dollar 
minimum wage, who’s going to hire 
an eighteen-year-old? Honest Joe 
forgot about that. Ask him about his 
vote on H.R. 5377. Write him; call 
him; ask him.” 

Corey looked out across the 
crowd, pausing. “Now my cam- 
paign manager says I’m going to 
lose if I make this speech. He says 
you don't care. He says all you 
want is more, more, more. 

“But I think the American people 
have had enough of empty prom- 
ises. Every time the Congress acts, 
it costs you. Five thousand dollars 
every time a politician introduces a 
bill. Twenty thousand dollars a sec- 
ond Just to keep Washington run- 
ning! 

“Thafs bad enough. But when 
you can’t start your car on a cold 
morning because of pollution con- 
trol devices, when you can’t heat 
your home two days a week be- 
cause of fuel controls, when your 
kids can’t get Jobs because they 
don’t have experience — and they 
can’t get experience because of all 
the regulations. .then it’s time to 
yell STOP! 

“How do you stop government? 
You stop the people who made the 
laws. You stop the Honest Joe 
Spielmans who promised every- 
thing and gave you nothing but 
more rules and taxes. 

“Maybe you do want more, but 
the only way you’ll get more is if 
the government gets less. Less regu- 
lations, less taxes. 



CAME THE REVOLUTION

“And maybe Tm wrong. Maybe 
you don’t care. But I think you do. 
I think you care enough to vote for 
me. A vote for Corey Grademan is 
a vote against Joe Spielman. A vote 
for Corey Grademan is a vote 
against government. You’ve said 
you want less government. Vote for 
less government! Vote for me. 

“Thank you.’’ 

Corey stepped back from the mi- 
crophone. The applause was scat- 
tered, less than modest. 

* it -k 

“And now the incumbent Con- 
gressman, Joe Spielman.’’ 

Spielman got a standing ovation. 

In the back of the armory, a 
Dixieland group struck up Spiel- 
man’s theme, “He’s Our Guy!’’ Large 
green and white “Our Guy’’ posters 
bounced above the crowd. Dozens 
of balloons soared into darkness 
above the girders. 

“My friends, it’s great to be 
back,’’ began Spielman. “And al- 
though Mr. Grademan and I have a 
number of differences, we ob- 
viously share the same concerns, 
particularly about the need for more 
jobs and less government interfer- 
ence. 

“No able-bodied American should 
be without a job. No young Ameri- 
can should wander the streets with 
a diploma looking for work. No 
American should have to depend 
on welfare for his daily bread. 

“No American should have to 



drive an unsafe car; no American 
should die of cancer because of pol- 
luted air and water. ...” 

Spielman flashed his charming 
smile and held up his hands to quiet 
and acknowledge the thundering 
applause.

“Ah, yes, Dr. Wilhouse. I’m 
George Hasled. I was impressed 
with your presentation.’’ 

Edmund Wilhouse, Ph.D., Phi 
Beta Kappa, Norton Fellow, stood 
up to meet the Chairman of the 
Political Science Department of 
West Bayview State College. 

“I’m the one who’s honored. 
Professor Hasled.’’ 

Wilhouse found himself ushered 
into a small neat office lined with 
bookshelves. Most of the shelves 
were empty. A few droopy plants 
and a handful of books were scat- 
tered about. 

The Professor plumped himself 
down behind the desk into an old 
wooden swivel chair. He took a 
cigar from the desk humidor and 
tapped it gently on the desk top. 

“Rather than beat around the 
bush, Wilhouse, I’d rather lay it on 
the line. First, you’re the best black 
candidate I’ve seen in a decade, 
maybe longer. Second, you come 
highly recommended — ’’ 

“But you aren’t going to offer 
me the job.’’ 

“That’s correct. Not because I 
don’t want to, but because I can’t.’’

lars,” added Wilhouse drily. 

“That does have a definite ef- 
fect,” added Professor Hasled. 

“What about the other candi- 
dates?” prompted Wilhouse. “Td 
like to know what I’m up against.” 

“You’re number three. Number 
one has never had a grade less than 
an A since the fourth grade, is a 
Rhodes Scholar, has had three 
books published, one of which 
made the best-seller list for non- 
fiction, and was rated the best 
teacher of the century at Palmdale 
Junior College. He also has other 
credentials, such as being a former 
all-American soccer player and hav- 
ing a number of off-Broadway act- 
ing credits. Why he even wants the 
job beats me.” 



“The Supreme Court rulings?” 
“That’s right. According to the 
College’s legal department, I must 
offer the job to the best candidate, 
regardless of race, color, creed, sex, 
or age. .as determined by objec- 
tive standards. 

“As you know,” the Chairman 
went on, lighting the cigar, “this 
will be the first vacancy in the De- 
partment in five years. I do not ex- 
pect another, barring accidents, for 
at least three more years. With the 
decline in school enrollments and 
the emphasis on more, shall we say, 
functional curricula, there’s little 
demand for Political Economy as a 
major any longer.” 

“Particularly when each year of 
college costs thirty thousand dol-

Wilhouse couldn’t help shaking 
his head sympathetically. 

Hasled looked at the young 
black. “You know. .it’s crazy. I 
never thought I’d be turning down a 
Norton Fellow with a Ph.D., a Phi 
Beta Kappa as well. .not for a job 
that offers as little as this. You 
know. .I’ve taken a look at your 
background, Wilhouse. You have a 
good stat base and the brains to 
succeed in either government or 
business. Why don’t you try it? 
This place is a madhouse. Old pro- 
fessors hanging on to tenure, with 
no place to go, almost no one to 
teach to. I’m the best of the 
worst.’’ 

He took another puff on the 
cigar. “You know. .we never 
applied our own disciplines to our- 
selves. .and no one else took us 
seriously.’’ 

The professor stood up. “I wish I 
could offer you the Job. Lord 
knows, you deserve it more than the 
rest of us here, but I’m not ready to 
leave and not gutsy enough to strike 
out again.’’ 

Wilhouse walked out of the dingy 
building, slowly, hands in his pock- 
ets.

“And now, without further intro- 
duction, Corey Grademan.’’ 

Corey stood and moved three 
chairs to the left to take the ros- 
trum. 

“Most of you are small busi- 



nesspeople. You’re busy individu- 
als, and you know a lot about your 
businesses, and how hard the 
government can make it on you.’’ 

Corey surveyed the tables, saw 
the quiet nods. 

“Now. .conventional wisdom 
would demand that I rail against 
Washington and bureaucrats espe- 
cially. I won’t. 

“I’ll just say this. Every single 
bureaucratic power has been given 
by Congress to the bureaucrats. 
That’s why I’m running against 
Honest Joe Spielman. Honest Joe 
has voted for virtually every piece 
of legislation to create more regula- 
tions. 

“For example, he voted for the 
Federal Safety Act. In case you 
don’t remember, that’s the follow- 
on to OSH A. FSA gave the federal 
government the right to close down 
every business in America without a 
warrant. 

“Honest Joe Spielman also voted 
for the Consumer Protection Act. 
And in case you don’t re- 
call. .that’s the one that says you 
have to refund the customer’s 
money no matter what he did to the 
product or how he misused it. 

“That’s all I have to say. Honest 
Joe says he’s for you. He’s never 
really voted for you, but he’s for 
you. I don’t think he is. And that’s 
why I’m running and why I want 
your vote. Thank you.’’ 

Corey saw the stunned look on a 
few faces. Only a few gave approv- 
ing nods. No applause.

Plaudder slipped twice on his 
way home from the bus stop. His 
elbow still tingled as he opened the

“So Spielman voted for the air-

Plaudder looked at the picture of 
Diane on the mantle. Two years 
ago, but it seemed like yesterday. 

He went to the refrigerator and 
pulled out a beer. 

“So Spielman voted for the air-

Plaudder looked at Diane’s pic- 



ture again. Then he began to sip the 
beer.

Corey looked around the fair- 
grounds. His vinyl boots were cov- 
ered with mud. He was still smiling 
as he passed out literature to pass- 
ing farmers. 

He handed a brochure to a 
wrinkled man. The man looked at 
it, tossed it onto the mud, and 
stared at Corey. 

“Why you running against Hon- 
est Joe? He’s always been a friend 
of the farmers.’’ 

“That’s what he tells you,” an- 
swered Corey. Several other men 
moved closer. 

Corey jabbed a finger at the 
farmer, who stepped back. 

“You say Honest Joe Spielman’s 
your friend. Honest Joe Spielman 
voted to impose the export bans on 
soybeans and wheat. Did that help 
you?” 

Corey pointed at another farmer. 

“Honest Joe Spielman voted to 
increase the powers of the EPA to 
shut off irrigation if the EPA says 
so. How many farmers does that 
help?” 

Several couples joined the audi- 
ence. 

“Honest Joe Spielman says he’s 
against gun control. But Honest Joe 
Spielman voted to restrict gun own- 
ership.” 

Corey surveyed the ten or twelve 
onlookers before continuing.

“All of you. .I’d like to ask 
you a question. If Joe Spielman 
votes against you so much, why do 
you vote for him?” 

“Cause he’s a friend of the 
farmer. He voted for price sup- 
ports,” responded a man near the 
back of the crowd. 

“You wouldn’t need them if the 
government weren’t controlling the 
export market and cutting back irri- 
gation and sending safety inspectors 
out on every farm in the country.” 
Corey stopped. The group was drift- 
ing away, all except one man. 

“Young feller, name’s Clem 
Bunker. What you said about 
Spielman’s votes true?” 

“Yes, Mr. Bunker, that’s the 
way he voted. If you want, I can 
even dig up the bill numbers and 
the dates.” 

“Don’t need that. You have 
them. .that’s fine.” Bunker looked 
at the candidate. “Son, you’re 
not going to win.” The man 
pointed at the backs of the departing 
formers. “They think they’re fine 
so long as Uncle Sam shells out the 
subsidies. But keep on preaching. 
Some of us are listening.”

headed toward the livestock ring.

Wilhouse flipped from viewer 
channel to viewer channel. He 
ended up facing Corey Grademan. 

“Honest Joe Spielman has op- 
posed good education by supporting

the mandatory tenure clause of the 
teachers’ union. No matter how old, 
or how incompetent, a teacher 
keeps a job forever. Does your 
child get the best teacher? Of course 
not, but Honest Joe Spielman 
doesn’t care about that. .” 

Edmund Wilhouse turned off the 
viewer. 

“So Spielman supports manda- 
tory tenure,” he murmured as he 
went back to the tedious business of 
checking university addresses. 

“That hypocritical son of a 
bitch.”

Plaudder knew the two by the

“Hey, Bob.” 

“Morning, Sam, Jim.” 

“Hey, Bob, you missed Spiel- 
man. He Just came through here. 
Man, he’s one sharp politi- 
cian. .even remembered how 
Gladys worked in his campaign four 
years ago.” 

“Handshaking isn’t everything,” 
muttered Plaudder. 

“What’s got into you. Bob?” 

“Spielman voted for air-bags.” 
Plaudder turned and headed back to 
the machine shop. 

Let them talk, about the freak ac- 
cident, about Diane, about the 
faulty air-bag in the other car. Let 
them talk. Spielman voted for air- 
bags. 

He began to set the jigs.

Clem Bunker pulled the rifle 
from the mount in the pickup cab, 
loaded it carefufly, and checked the 
safety. 

He closed the pickup door and, 
still carrying the rifle, began to 
walk toward the barbecue on the 
other side of the fairgrounds. After 
a time, he stepped into the empty 
exhibition building and went to the 
far side. Through the open slats he 
could see Spielman mingling with 
the crowd. 

Bunker steadied the rifle on the 
ledge, picked up Spielman in the 
sights. He held the politician in the 
sights for a long time. Then he 
sighed and put down the gun. He 
slid the safety on and walked back 
to the pickup. 

“I couldn’t even shoot a damned 
skunk,” he muttered as he replaced 
the gun in the cab mount.

Jim Westnor picked up the mail. 
It had fallen on the hall floor when 
the mailperson had shoved it 
through the slot. 

He leafed through the stack. The 
repair bill for the wall viewer, an 
advertising card from a new men’s 
store specializing in the gay look, a 
campaign brochure. 

Westnor looked at the date on his 
watch. He could go vote. 

CAME THE REVOLUTION 



He dropped the mail on the table, 
all except the flier. He read the 
cover as he went out into the 
apartment hallway.

Grademan. .he was the young 
fellow who talked to the Small

Westnor scanned the pamphlet as 
he walked back down to the garage. 

So Honest Joe Spielman was one 
of the originators of FSA? So Hon- 
est Joe Spielman opposed a lower 
minimum wage for teenagers? That 
might have helped Ted, given him a 
chance. If he’d had a chance at a 
job. .Westnor crumpled the flier 
and jammed it into his pocket. 

He marched across the garage to 
the electro scooter and yanked open 
the door. Westnor threw himself 
into the seat and slammed the door.

Plaudder picked up Diane’s pis- 
tol. She'd always kept it in the bed- 
side table. He’d moved as little as 
possible. 

Plaudder took out the box of 
shells, methodically loaded the gun, 
and set it on the bed, the barrel 
pointing at the headboard. He put 
the shell box back in his top dresser 
drawer. Then he checked the safety 
again and eased the gun into the 
deep overcoat pocket. 

He looked in the full-length mir- 
ror for a long moment before going 
out the bedroom door.

Westnor opened the apartment 
door. Betsy was still watching the 
early national returns on the wall 
viewer. Her drink was sitting on the 
table, untouched. He slipped open 
the closet door and hung the heavy 
coat on a hook. 

“Jim, that didn’t take long.” 

“No. .1 just ran down to the 
Quik ’N Go. They’ve got soda 
there.” He gestured to the wall 
screen. “Anything interesting yet?” 

“No. I was surprised to learn you 
voted. You never do. And now 
you’re asking me about the election 
returns. ” 

He grinned weakly. “I’m sort of 
surprised myself. But I had to make 
some sort of gesture after I found 
out. .oh, never mind. .long 
story.” 

He went into the small kitchen 
and poured a triple scotch with a 



dash of soda, then came back into 
the living room and sat down in the 
easirocker next to hers. 

“You've been running all over 
tonight, Jim. It's not good for you. 
First, you run out and vote. Then 
you come back and throw dinner 
together. Then you run out to the 
store, and now you’ve poured your- 
self a triple to relax. Now will you 
stay put and simmer down?” 

He sighed. “Yep. Yep. For a 
few minutes, anyway. How was 
work?” 

“Fine. .” Betsy held up her 
hand and pointed to the screen. 

“We’re going to turn you over to 
our affiliated stations for fifteen 
minutes of local returns. We’ll be 
back at ten.” 

The viewer screen beeped several 
times, flashed red, and turned gray. 
Then a please stand by appeared. 

“We seem to have lost the 
picture, but we have an urgent 
bulletin from Spielman Head- 
quarters. George Kortine is there. 
George, we’ve lost the video. Can 
you hear us?” 

Westnor leaned forward in the 
easirocker. 

“Yes, Cathy, I can hear you. It’s 
a madhouse here! Joe Spielman has 
been shot! Joe Spielman, just re- 
elected to his sixth term, has been 
shot by an unknown assailant. We 
don’t know much, but apparently a 
man walked up to Spielman to offer 
congratulations and shot the Con- 
gressman several times with a con- 
cealed weapon.

“I repeat, Joe Spielman has been 
shot. We had just predicted his vic- 
tory not fifteen minutes ago.” 

The picture swirled into focus on 
a thin black man, then shifted to 
show several police holding a crowd 
back from a prone figure. A woman 
and several men were kneeling 
around the body. The woman, the 
doctor, was working on Spielman. 

“In the confusion the suspect es- 
caped. No one we’ve talked to even 
saw the man.” 

The picture shifted back to the 
black reporter. 

“This is George Kortine at 
Spielman Headquarters. That’s all 
we have for now.” 

Betsy turned to her husband. 
“Isn’t that near here? That must 
have been why there were so many 
sirens Just before you got back.” 

“There’s some sort of political 
office in the building next door,” 
began Westnor. “Do you think 
that’s Spielman’s place?” 

Betsy looked at him, then turned 
back to the screen. 

Westnor got up and went into the 
front hall. Betsy was still glued to 
the screen. He opened the closet 
and eased the gun out of the coat 
pocket. He moved into the bedroom 
and sat down on the bed. He 
emptied the six unfired shells from 
the chambers and put them back in 
the box. 

Then Westnor put the gun back 
in the drawer. He shook his head. 
He looked up. 

Betsy was standing in the door. 



“Jim?” 

“No. Didn’t have to.” 

He got up slowly and walked 
back to the living room to watch the 
rest of the returns. Betsy sat down 
next to him.

Quinn Dolbert was studying the 
tables Brown Glorian had sent up 
from Research when the desk vidfax 
buzzed. He tapped the acknowl- 
edgment stud. 

“Dolbert.” He looked in the 
screen to see Sarah Yee, the 
Senior Editor, impatiently gesturing 
with her pencil. 

“Quinn, you’re doing the statisti- 
cal wrap-up on the elections?” she 
asked. 

“Yes.” 

“Hand it over to Dorsey Jones.” 

“Right now?” 

“Now.” Sarah stuck the pencil 
over one ear. “You know that five 
incumbent members of Congress 
were shot during the campaign?” 

“Right, but Pressing is expected 
to recover.” 

“No quibbling, Quinn. Since 
when have even four members of 
Congress been killed in the same 
campaign?” 

“I’d guess never.’’ 

“You guess right. I want you to 
find out why.” 

Quinn was left staring at an 
empty screen.

The balding professor looked at 
the sleepy class in front of him. 

“I realize that eight o’clock is a 
preposterous hour for an exam, but 
political science is not a course fa- 
vored by a more functionally 
minded administration. .so we are 
gathered together at this rather inaus- 
picious hour.” 

The professor held up a small 
blue notebook. 

“This is a blue book. I believe I 
am the last professor still requiring 
written exams. You will inscribe 
your immortal responses to the 
questions I am about to place 
on the blackboard in these tidy 
pamphlets. You may use pencil, 
ink, or suitable substitutes." 

Deal Wheeler shook his head as 
he watched the professor chalk up 
the three questions. 

1. IS A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOC- 
RACY ELECTED BY 51% OF 
30% OF THE ELIGIBLE VOTERS 
PROPERLY CLASSED AS EITHER 
REPRESENTATIVE OR A DEMOC- 
RACY? 

2. PROFILE THE MOST SUCCESS- 
FUL TYPE OF ELECTIVE 
POLITICIAN FOR THE CURRENT 
SYSTEM, CONSIDERING THE 
BASIS OF GOVERNMENT. 

3. PREDICT THE MOST LIKELY 
OUTCOME OF SUCH A SYSTEM 
IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS, IN 
YOUR OPINION. 



“I will see you all in two 
hours.” The professor smiled and 
left.

Quinn looked at the sheets. Fi- 
nally he tapped out Sarah Yee’s 
number. He waited for her image to 
focus on the vidfax screen. 

“I’ve got it.” 

“The story on the killings?” 

“Same, same,” Quinn answered. 
“Is there anyone in your office?” 

A look of annoyance crossed her 
face. 

“Is there anyone in your office?” 
he repeated. 

“Does it matter, Mr. Dolbert?” 

“Yes.” 

“If you insist, then.” The 
screen went gray for several min- 
utes. 

“All right. Let’s have your secret 
message.” 

“Sarah. .first, let me say I 
don’t believe it. Second. .1 do be- 
lieve it. And third. .I’m against 
running it.” 

“Quinn, what the hell are you 
trying to say?” 

He cleared his throat. “Last elec- 
tion, about ten incumbents were 
roughed up at some time during 
their campaigns. All ten won easily. 
Remember that. This election, there 
were three cases of assault on in- 
cumbents, plus the five shootings.” 

“And?” prompted Sarah. 

“There’s only one thing in com- 
mon,” he continued. “In this elec-

tion only five challengers personally 
attacked the record of the incum- 
bents.” 

”Quinn, you’re putting me on.” 
”Okay. Let me put it another 
way. Five challengers threw all the 
dirt they could at the incum- 
bents. .from party-line votes, 
hypocrisy, conflicts on their voting 
record. .whatever. Here’s what’s 
even more interesting. All five were 
re-elected easily, even though three 
were dead before the election. Pres- 
sing was hospitalized, and Spielman 
was killed election night.” 

“Wait a minute! Are you telling 
me that only the incumbents who 
had mud-slinging opponents were 
assaulted?” 

“That’s right. Remember the ten 
assaults last election? As far as I can 
check, those ten incumbents also 
ran against mud-slingers. Now, I 
don’t mean grubby dirt. .1 mean 
that the challengers had good solid 
facts that hurt the incumbents, or 
caught them in their own words.” 
“Skip that. What about the three 
cases of assault this election?” 
Sarah’s face was intent. 

Quinn shrugged. “Far as I can 
figure, challengers couldn’t quite 
link the incumbents to the problems. 
Tried, but couldn’t make the case.” 
“Quinn, that’s the most prepos- 
terous story I’ve ever heard. Why, 
you almost sucked me into it.” 
Sarah Yee laughed. 

Quinn Dolbert laughed.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it 
again: I’ve always been a rather 
backward lad. 

And I mean that (in this case) lit- 
erally. As a child, riding in my par-

the back window, fascinated by 
where I’d been. I like to re-read old 
diaries. When I got married to 
Jeanne, we had the whole damn 
ceremony videotaped (an outdoor 
triple-wedding in the north forty) 
and had an instant-replay in the

As near as I can figure, by the 
time this sees print, the 1977 Hugo 
Awards should- already be history, 
or nearly so, and damned if I’ll try 
to predict the results. Let somebody 
else stick their neck out. (You did 
vote, didn’t }?bu? You don’t want 
your favorite writers to starve? Be- 
lieve me, in this racket they will 
without your support.) But perhaps 
now might be a good time to look at 
some major events in sf that took 
place in 1976, but will not be re- 
flected in the Hugos. 

There is, for example, no cate- 
gory for Best New Magazine. 1976 
saw the birthing of five new 
magazines in the genre (I’m talking 
prozines here — Harry Warner alone 
knows how many new fanzines were 
spawned!), which is probably a rec- 
ord and certainly four more than 
there’ve been in a mort of years. 
(Yes, I know one of them didn’t 
appear until early '77 — but it was 
birthed in ’76.) 

Isaac Asinwv\s SF Magazine doesn’t 
look too bad, but 1 hate the lay- 
out and the format and see no 
Justification for the use of Isaac’s 
name or picture: his opening 

‘‘editorial” was the slickest dis- 
claimer since the back of the West- 
ern Union form. Furthermore, I was 
offended that a good half of the 
hundreds of classified ads were from 
practitioners of the classic “earn 
money stuffing envelopes” mail 
fraud — pyramid schemes gimme the 
pip: their perpetrators are germs 
who can only exist in an environ- 



ment of decay. But the stories 
weren't bad, and Charlie Brown does a 
good Job with the total Minireview 
format. Galileo is remarkably im- 
proved in its second number, and 
may make it yet — if their demented 
three-part payment schedule doesn’t 
ruin them. They’re still not up 
to the quality-level at which Ver- 
tex folded a few years ago — but 
then they haven’t got near Ver- 
tex's budget. And I really enjoy 
A. A. Whyte’s “pre-reviews” — they’re 
something I always wished I could 
do in this column, and can’t. Un- 
earth, the magazine specifically for 
previously unpublished writers, has 
Kiss Of Death written all over it and 
will almost certainly be belly-up by 
the time you read this. Cosmos, on 
the other hand, should by now be 
firmly established, if not wildly suc- 
cessful — its first number, the only 
one out as I write, is the most ex- 
citing debut issue I’ve ever seen. I

Baen came to Galaxy (did I happen 
to mention that I got a raise this 
month?), and I’ve entered a 
two-year subscription. 

I’ve saved Ariel for last (and- 
given its ordering-info in this col- 
umn’s heading) because it’s the only 
one I haven’t seen advertised heav- 
ily in the sf marketplace, the only 
one you can’t almost certainly locate 
without effort. Apparently they 
spent more on quality than on hype, 
which alone calls for applause. A 
quarterly devoted to fantasy and 
fantasy art (including comics), Ariel 
is outsize (9 X 12), printed on better 
paper than Cosmos, glue-bound 
rather than stapled, and goes for six 
skins. It comes from Momingstar 
Press (PO Box 6011, Leawood, Kan- 
sas 66206), the same outfit that 
brought you the incredible Robert 
Howard/Richard Corben pictorial 
novel Bloodstar (an artifact worth 
its weight in diamonds), and the 
first issue of Ariel features a daz- 
zling color Corben cover, the first 
section of Corben’s “Den” in color, 
and an excerpt from Bloodstar 
which doesn’t begin to do it justice. 
It also has Part 1 of a rare extended 
interview with Frank Frazetta; a 
color Frazetta back cover (a blowup 
from “The Frost Giants”); a 
thoughtful and profusely illustrated 
article on his work by Margaret 
Wilson-Cline; two Robert Howard 
poems; an illustrated interview with 
Bume Hogarth on the occasion 
of his final Tarzan assignment; and 
a fascinating article on the 



psychological evolution of Batman 
(and, therefore, of Bruce Wayne 
— and, in a sense, of thee and 
me) from 1939 to the present, also 
illustrated (everything in here is 
illustrated). There are also two re- 
markably silly articles on The 
Parallels Between Frank Frazetta 
and Marlon Brando and on Conan 
As Existentialist, and two stories. I 
liked one — a tall tale by Paul 
Boles — and can’t comment on the 
other because 1 simply can’t read 
that kind of story: I’m colorblind in 
that range. 

A remarkable magazine, as wel- 
come to fantasy lovers as Cosmos 
will be to science-fiction fans, and 
worth the high price.

Sf also gained not one but two 
new record companies in 1976 (al- 
though, as with the above 
magazines, some of the new product 
didn’t hit the market until early 
’77), which is another 
ahem . record. 

There was only one other, far’s 
I know, a remarkably dull one cal- 
led Caedmon, which is one of the 
largest spoken-word companies in 
the world and threw in a few 
Asimov and Bradbury readings in an 
attempt to the eclectic. It will cer- 
tainly be dwarfed — in this genre, 
anyway — by Alternate Worlds Re- 
cordings (148 East 70 St., New 
York NY 10021), which exploded 
with nearly a dozen releases in its

first year of existence. I’ve already 
reviewed half of them, each a 
[x^ach, and there’s a bunch more 
here on my desk. I’m sorry to say 
that, for me, AWR has lost its 
no-hitter. " 

Not that these aren’t excellent re- 
cordings — as such they are superb. 
But if AWR recorded only works 
and writers that / like, they’d have 
to ignore an awful lot of extremely 
popular sf (the way I do). 

Take Brian Aldiss’s Frankenstein 
Unbound, for instance. It’s a de- 
parture from AWR’s usual format: a 
dramatization starring the author 
rather than a straight reading by 
same. It comprises an abridgment 
of Tom Vernon’s four-and- 
a-half-hour BBC dramatization 
(which was broadcast in London 
in 1974) with connecting narration 
by Aldiss — and again, as such 
it’s clearly superior to most BBC 
radio drama. This means it’s almost 
bearable in spots. But the story it- 
self is one which I find both tedious 
and pointless, a labor-of-love retell- 
ing of Frankenstein which in my 
opinion adds nothing significant to 
the original. The “parallel worlds’’ 
or “shifting reality levels’’ cliche is 
employed, apparently for the dual 
purpose of a) placing on the scene 
(presumably for contrast) a 20th- 
century man who never for a 
second sounds remotely like a 
20th-century man except in the data 
he possesses, and b) allowing Al- 
diss, who plays the protagonist, to 
vicariously seduce Mary Shel- 



ley — which, since Aldiss’s Billion 
Year Spree nominated her for The 
Mother of SF, has an Oedipal con- 
notation that I find entirely too 
cutesy. The style is authentic — that 
is, a hundred years out of 
date — loaded with melodrama and 
circumlocution and cornball dying 
speeches in which the last rattling 
breath serves to launch six to ten 
thousand words. The abridgment 
job certainly doesn’t help, but 1 
have a feeling that the four-and- 
a-half-hour original was Just 
as formless, hammy and histori- 
cally interesting. On the other hand, 
you might love it. 

it it it 

Likewise Joanna Russ Interpret- 
ing Her Stories turned me off — as 
her cover-copy Jubilantly predicted 
it would. Unhappily, the title is a 
misnomer: she does not interpret her 
stories; she only reads them aloud. 

Oh, side one is Just fine: “When 
It Changed’’ is a damned fine story 
and deserved its award, and Russ’s 
reading adds some depth and some 
clarity. But the going gets muddy 
on side two: on a good stereo you’ll 
hear the axe grinding in the 
background, and sometimes in the 
foreground. Feminism of the 
Sneering Sophomore school: people 
who dance around in front of me 
with their dukes held high make me 
either edgy or amused depending on 
my mood, and in neither case am I 
moved to subsidize ’em. The last

if you don’t listen to me, I'll break 
your neck.” (Honest to God.) If 
that’s the choice, perhaps I should 
bring a bodyguard to the next 
Worldcon. 

★ ★ ★ 

On the other hand, Ursula K. 
LeGuin’s album. The Ones Who 
Walk Away From Ornelas, is a 
genuine masterpiece, perhaps the 
best in the AWR catalogue. LeGuin 
has a wonderful reading voice, as 
full of warmth and subtlety as her 
stories, and the selection here is 
splendid. 

I’ve publicly bitched about 
“Omelet” on the grounds that it 
won a short story award and is 
clearly not a short story. It is a par- 
able, and I guess now is the time to 
state publicly that it’s a damned 
good one. It comes alive on record; 
in fact I believe this may be its 
natural medium. I know I enjoyed 
hearing it more than I did reading it. 

On the flip we have the Orgota 
Creation Myth from The Left Hand 
of Darkness, also a parable, also 
Just peachy in this medium — and a 
marvelous and poignant short story 
called “The Direction of the 
Road.” It is told in the first person 
by an oak tree, and it contains 
some of the most memorable lines 
in my experience, and it is remarka- 
ble in every way — I never spent a 
more enjoyable twenty minutes 
(well, maybe that’s going a bit too 



far . ). Sf is supposed to give us 
different viewpoints, and this is one 
of the most fascinating I’ve seen 
yet. 

Although Pohl’s Law states that 
nothing is so good that someone 
somewhere won’t hate it, 1 can 
hardly imagine anyone failing to 
enjoy this delightful album. Oh, and 
the George Barr cover is lovely.

That covers AWR up to as close 
as the present as this column can get 
you. Now for the second new sf re- 
cord company I mentioned: Analog. 

Yep — Analog (350 Madison Ave., 
New York, NY 10017) has en- 
tered the record biz, and with a 
damned impressive debut disc. 
Nightfall (like Frankenfurter On- 
Bun) is a dramatization of Isaac 
Asimov’s world-famous classic story 
about Lagash, the triple-sun world 
where the stars only come out every 
2,050 years. As a dramatization it 
is superior to Unbound — about 
medium CBC quality (that means 
twice as good as anything you’re li- 
able to hear on stateside radio). 
Scripter and producer James H.B. 
Cutting has done an admirable job 
of adapting the 1941 classic to a 
sonofabitch of a medium (have you 
ever tried to adapt a story to radio? 
/ have, and 1 admired Cutting’s suc- 
cess). 

Furthermore, you get a fifteen- 
minute rap at the end, between the 
Good Doctor (he’s not listed with

(he A.M.A., so he may really be a 
good doctor) and a certain magazine 
editor who shall remain nameless 
iiniil 1 review his latest book a 
eouple of paragraphs from now. The 
said rap includes background anec- 
dt)(es on the story and its reception 
over the years which are informative 
and hilarious, as well as Isaac’s 
eomments on the production itself. 
Altogether a fine recording of one 
of the most popular stories in all sf. 

Rumor hath it that the next re- 
Uasc from Analog will be a 
dramatization of one of Gordy 
Dickson’s Dorsai stories, and will 
include Gordy himself singing Dor- 
sai songs and playing his guitar. 
I've sat up until six a.m., times 
when it was really drunk out, to 
hear that latter — I look forward to 
the record. Analog Records, by the 
way, are, like AWR’s, $6.95 the 
hit.

What else happened in sf in 1976? 
Well, the first concerted attempt 
(n mass-produce sf peanuts failed. 

I oscr . pardon me . Laser 
hooks went where all lasers go 
when somebody takes the ruby 
away. Harlequin, the Toronto com- 
pany that has been mass-producing 
( iothic peanuts so effectively for so 
long, pulled its rubies out after a 
little less than a year, insisting 
meanwhile to the press that sales 
had been entirely satisfactory. In 
tact, so much Kiss Of Death hov- 
i red over the project from its in- 



ception that they never dared send 
me, or Lester del Rey, or any major 
sf reviewer, review copies. Despite 
two letters and a long-distance call 
to Toronto before the first Lasers 
were released, I got my first review 
copies on the very day I read in 
Locus that Laser was dead. They’ve 
been arriving regularly ever since, 
each accompanied by a comput- 
erized bill for “NIL,” and my 
Ashley Automatic woodbuming 
stove is starting to fill up with 
staples. It is impossible to believe 
that anyone connected with the proj- 
ect knew anything whatever about 
sf. Ah well — maybe now Kelly 
Freas’ll get back to work. And 
maybe (please God) publishers will 
stop listening to Roger El wood. 

Sf peanuts sold OK on TV, of 
course — peanuts is what they want 
there. As I write, Space 1999 
(marked down, as they say, from 
2001) is doing quite well, renewed 
for another quarter-mil-per-episode 
season, minus its only real actor and 
plus the first dea ex machina I’m 
aware of. (They no longer have to 
put Novocaine in Barbara Bain’s 
face cream — constant exposure to 
electromagnetic-type radiation has 
taken its toll, and now she just 
naturally looks that way. I would 
too.) If Holmes & YoYo had sur- 
vived, I’d now be contemplating 
some pun about SheerLuck Holmes 
(Wats-on tonight, dear?); but mer- 
cifully the thing is dead. May it rest 
in pieces. 

There were two gigantic peanuts

in sf movies in 1976, and I prefer 
not to discuss them, thank you. 

And in 1976, they filled in the 
last blank in Edgar Pangborn’s biog. 
The blank right after, “Born, 
1909 ...” 

On the off-chance that you have 
never read this column before, I will 
add only that Edgar was one of the 
three finest science-fiction writers 
that ever lived, and that we as a 
species should be proud to have 
produced him. The creator of Davy, 
A Mirror For Observers, The 
Judgment of Eve, Company of 
Glory, “Angefs Egg” and “Harper 
Conan and Singer David” will write 
no more, and that is an event of 
significance to the whole world 
— not just our little ghetto corner 
of it. 

Also taken from us were Thomas 
Burnett Swann, Fritz Lang, Mary 
Gnaedinger and Daniel Galouye.

So much for 1976 In Review. 
Now let’s take a giant step back- 
ward: as the Firesign Theater says, 
“Forward, into the past.” 

Last month I did a lot of shouting 
about Cyril Kornbluth, and just as 
that column went into the mail, I got 
a couple of reprints of collaborations 
between Kornbluth and Fred Pohl. I 
found one more in the stackon- 
thedesk, and decided to tell you 
about ’em. 

Because in case you didn’t know, 
the Pohl-Kornbluth collaboration 
was the finest in sf history. 



(I haven’t seen a reissue of The 
Space Merchants yet, and I haven’t 
read it in ten years, but it is one of 
the most famous works in the field. 
I’ll review it if and when it arrives. 
Meanwhile I seem to have every- 
thing else the pair ever wrote — at 
least in book-length. They sent me a 
P&K story-collection too . but I 
lost it at Boskone.) 

Fred’s and Cyril’s work together 
in the early 50s was certainly not 
the first satiric sf ever done — but it in- 
spired an explosion of that kind 
of sf, which is still around today in 
the works of John Boyd and Ron 
Goulart (to give the opposite ends 
of a spectrum). P&K didn’t invent 
the notion of extrapolating-/;c- 
yond - the - point - of - absurdity — 
but they gave it a quantum jump in 
sophistication, in relevance, hooked 
it into an enormously more subtle 
social consciousness — and gave it a 
bite like an angry chainsaw. And 
they invariably refused the tempta- 
tion to bake a nutmeg cake: in 
every single instance the satire is 
incidental, merely the setting in 
which a valid story with a non- 
satiric theme takes place. 

Search the Sky, the first of these, 
is a wildly inventive and achingly 
funny book. Characteristically, it 
demands a helluva lot of suspension 
of disbelief — the tongue must be 
imbedded in the cheek — but the in- 
ternal logic is unassailable. 

The setting is a far future in 
which mankind has established itself 
on a few dozen worlds or so, with- 



124 



GALAXY 




out any kind of FTL drive. Con- 
sequently exchange between these 
worlds is a seldom thing, with 
worse time-lags than this column, 
and warfare is a thing of the past. 
P&K apply simple genetics to the 
picture and end up concluding that 
there are things beside which the 
threat of warfare is a preferred op- 
tion. In part, the thesis is an exten- 
sion of the premise Cyril originally 
used in his classic masterpiece, “The 
Marching Morons,” but extended 
through many centuries to show that 
even the stars can’t save us, without 
ITL. 

And the book is funny as hell 
throughout. The hero is a marvelous 
chump, an earnest young man who 
yearns to be a Hero and does his 
best and works it all out logically 
and decisively and keeps ending up 
hip-deep in shit. The heroine, cer- 
tain to goad radical feminists into 
apoplexy, is a dizzy, dithering cup- 
cake who does everything backass- 
wards and keeps coming up covered 
in diamonds — which drives him up a 
wall. Their careening progress a- 
cross the galaxy (on an FTL ship that 
she jiggered with a hairpin) is a 
/oo-parade of zaniness — yet in the 
end it is his logic that literally saves 
the human race, once he’s gotten 
over a bad case of Frozen Post- 
ulates. 

A satisfying book, meticulously 
logical, darkly satiric and consist- 
ently hilarious. 

★ ★ ★ 



Gladiator-At-Law, published a 
year later, is a chillingly funny 
book — so many of its most dismal 
projections are now “topical,” the 
satire strikes too close for comfort. 
We have a world in which only 
those whose services are valued by 
the great multinational corporations 
get to live in decent housing (“bub- 
ble-homes”), while the majority 
have to live in the miserable decay- 
ing jungles that our slapped-to- 
gether-of-inferior-materials suburbs 
will surely become; a world in 
which the rich are much richer and 
the poor much poorer, in which 
both groups take their amusement 
from public gladiatorial circuses 
which amount to stupendous blood- 
baths. 

This book, too, is funny, but the 
humor is subtler than in Sky\ 
sharper, more underplayed, never 
quite becoming slapstick. It barely 
blunts the edge of some very real 
anger, anger aimed at the mentality 
that is destroying us: the pro- 

fit-at-all-costs syndrome. P&K per- 
sonify this in two of the evilest 
villains I’ve ever come across, the 
Struldbrugs, and lead another ear- 
nestly-inept protagonist into a 
death-struggle with them, fought 
through the stockmarket and the 
sacred halls of corporate law. He 
succeeds only with the help of some 
extraordinarily vivid and believable 
supporting characters, and many 
deft subplots are ironed out with 
seemingly effortless elegance. This 
is one of the pair’s best efforts, sec-

ond only to Space Merchants in 
maturity and depth of ironic insight. 

★ ★ ★ 

Wolfbane is an entirely different 
kind of book, something of a de- 
parture for P&K. For one thing, it is 
not remotely funny, never tries to 
be. For another, it does not use a 
straight-line extrapolation of things- 
known: it posits major alteration 
of human destiny by alien inter- 
vention. No satiric slices are taken, 
save those that no story involv- 
ing humans can avoid. 

Briefly, Wolfbane takes place 
years after all humanity has been 
conquered and enslaved by mysteri- 
ous aliens, who have manifested 
themselves as two enormous black 
pyramids, one on the Moon and one 
squatting on Mount Everest. The 
pyramids harvest people. What’s left 
of mankind is divided into two 
groups, the Citizens and the 
Wolves. The former Just about wor- 
ship the pyramids; the latter plot 
hopelessly against them. 

Eventually, of course, the times 
produce a hero who combines 
enough elements of Citizen and 
Wolf to allow for a solution. Un- 
fortunately, he is very nearly the 
only human character who achieves 
realness — the others tend to be a 
bit one-dimensional. But the eight- 
brained Snowflake really comes 
across — and there’s a wealth of 
carefully-detailed plotting, some 
rigorous thought, and a satisfying 
climax. 



Truth to tell, I can’t get a firm 
handle on exactly why I liked this 
one so much. When I analyze it, it 
comes out just “okay” — but there’s 
something about it. Maybe it’s just 
that it was P&K’s last collabora- 
tion — damn near the last thing Cyril 
ever wrote. Or maybe I just like the 
central image of a gigantic alien 
brain contracting cancer. 

I dunno. “Something in the way 
it moves ...” 

Speaking of Kornbluth & Pohl, 
this month 1 had the good fortune to 
meet a lady who knew/knows them 
both quite well (she twice 
collaborated with the former and 
once married the latter). Judith 
Merril was GoH at Halycon I, the 
first Nova Scotia sf convention (or- 
ganized by Prof. Dorothy Broderick 
and sponsored by the Dalhousie U. 
School of Library Service — to 
whom thanks for a helluva good 
time), and she left a deep and last- 
ing impression on me. She was also 
good enough to give me a copy of 
The Best of Judith Merril, which is 
certainly more than the publishers 
bothered to do, and I’m almost as 
grateful for that as I was for the 
chance to meet Judy in the first 
place. 

If I had had this book on hand a 
few months ago when I did my 
all- women column, it would clearly 
have been Best-Of-Show. As it is, 
it’s pick-of-the- month, at the very 
least. 95% on the Spidermeter

couldn't make head nor tail of; 
more than offset by big bonuses for 
“Daughters of Earth," “Dead 
Center," and “Stormy Weather,"

poem, “Auction Pit," which I did

momentarily, that you’re sitting 
with a book in your hands, squint- 
ing at funny black squiggles on its 
pages. When you come across sev- 
eral such in one book, it’s an event. 

The collection includes “That 
Only A Mother," one of the best 
first-stories in sf, and a first-rate in- 
troduction by Virginia Kidd, and it 
doesn’t come within light-years of 
the feminine chauvinism the cover 
and blurbs try to impute to it, and 1 
recommend it highly.

What the hell is a juvenile novel? 
Why do we sneer at them? What 
distinguishes one from an adult 
novel? 

There are some obvious distinc- 
tions. The author is not permitted to 
confuse the reader with stylistic 
mahooha and multilevel allegories 
and shifting reality-levels . gee, 
that sounds kind of refreshing. The 
author is not permitted to bore the 
reader or attempt to gross him 
out . gosh, that sounds okay too. 



The author is not permitted to wan- 
der aimlessly: an identifiable-with 
protagonist must undergo some 
rigorous trial and emerge a larger 
person — you know, that challenge- 
and-response stuff that low-brow 
writers keep trying to tell us that 
Life is all about. That doesn’t 
turn me off either. 

Heinlein once said the best way 
to write a juvenile sf novel is to 
take a youthful protagonist, write 
the best damned novel you can 
around him or her, and then cut the 
sex. 

Well nowadays, by golly, you 
don’t even have to cut the sex — 
unless it’s grotesque, exploitive or 
overtly S&M flavored — and I can 
live with those restrictions too; I’m 
bored with Delany’s black-leather- 
jackets-and-smelly-armpits stuff. 

So I thoroughly enjoyed Ben 
Bova’s new juvenile. City of Dark- 
ness. It reminds me sharply of 
Heinleio’s “Coventry" — save that 
the Coventry here is a place called 
New York City. They only open it 
to the general public in the summer, 
and lock it up again on Labor 
Day — but one young lad, through 
misadventure, gets locked in for the 
winter, and finds that the city is far 
from uninhabited. Surviving that 
winter turns him into a man — and 
into a more responsible citizen of 
the Outside, too. He finds love, and 
the pain of its loss, and deadly 
danger, and useful work for his 
hands and brain, and I had a good 
time following along.

There’ re also some very real 
characters, some competent plotting, 
a carefully painted background and 
an extremely together black youth 
gang, all set in the ruins of the city 
that science-fiction writers most love 
to destroy (see my own Telempath, 
$7.95 from Berkley). 

So young readers get to read this 
stuff — and I have to wade through 
Sodsack In the Furnace and 
Dullgrinl Me for a second child- 
hood.

Who's Who In SF isn’t a bad 
idea — but it seems to me a poor job 
of execution. Capsule bios of famous 
folk in sf can be handy — 1 
can use ’em here in this column. 
But there’s not enough in this volume 
to help me. Example: I saw a 
blurb-quote from “H.H. Holmes” 
on the back of Woljbane, and it 
rang a bell, so I looked him up in 
Who's Who. Nothing. Okay, so they 
don’t list pseudonyms. Only they 
do: the next day I stumbled over 
“Holmes” listed under his other 
pseudonym, “Anthony Boucher” 
(real name: William White). Okay, 
so they list by best-known 
name — so why is Vargo Statten 
(British author of over 50 books) 
listed only under his real name, 
John Russell Fearn? Only one of 
Cyril Kornbluth’s pseudonyms is giv- 
en in his entry, and that one 
(“Cyril Judd”) is incorrectly iden- 
tified as one that he used with Pohl. 

Enough on pseudonyms. How 



about other data? Well, the bio stuff 
rarely gets deeper than birth date, 
and when it does, it’s often mis- 
leading. The graphic is always 
incomplete — which I understand, as 
a complete Asimov biblio alone 
would triple the size of the book. 
But even the representative selection 
is sloppy: compiler Brian Ash seems 
to be unaware that Edgar Pangbom 
once wrote a book called Davy. 
Also, most entries are objec- 
tive — but where Ash has prejudices 
(as with Heinlein), he feels free to 
shovel ’em in there — an abuse in his 
position. 

And although the book claims to 
be current to the end of 1976, there 
are no entries for James Baen (al- 
though Bova and Ferman and even 
Ted White are cited), Jerry Pour- 
nelle (although his collabs with Ni- 
ven are faithfully listed — under 
Larry's name), or Yours Truly. 
Startingly, there is an entry for Dick 
Geis — but not for Alter (nor for 
Charlie Brown or Andy Porter or 
Mike Glicksohn or ai other 
big-name fan whatsoever) — and 
nowhere does the Geis entry suggest 
that he works for a prozine. 

Any man who undertakes to com- 
pile a Who’s Who of sf in total ig- 
norance of the existence of the sec- 
ond largest-selling prozine in the 
world is leading with his chin, and 
I’m here to punch it squarely. The 
one thing a reference work must not 
be is confused, and that’s the single 
overriding characteristic of Who's 
Who In SF.

Weird Tales is exactly what the 
title implies: facsimile reproductions 
(hilarious ads and all) of selected 
excerpts from Weird Tales, the 
magazine of horror and fantasy fic- 
tion whose originals command such 
breath-taking prices at Worldcon 
huckster rooms these days. Taken 
from all throughout WT's 31 -year 
lifespan (1923-1954), these selec- 
tions — by folks like Howard, 
Lovecraft, Derleth, C.A. Smith, 
Quinn, Kuttner, Wellman, Leiber, 
Bloch, Bradbury, Sturgeon and E.F. 
Russell — are a pure delight, exactly 
like flipping through a complete 
collection of the magazine (which 
would cost more than the Kennedy 
hit did) (the first one, I mean). 
There are several excellent Finlay 
illos — the only place where facsimile 
format hurts (pulp paper was a poor 
medium for Finlay’s genius) — and 
even a few facsimile readers’ letters. 
Dammit, I don’t even like this kind 
of story, and I had a ball reading 
through this book. I compute the 
price (converting pounds to dollars 
and adding the standard 20%) at 
about $6.75, cheaper than many 
hardback anthos half the size. 

This is the second Peter Haining

and ended up loving (the first was 
The Ancient Mysteries Reader — see 
Sept. ’76 Galaxy “Bookshelf” — ) 
keep it up, sir, keep it up. 

Oh yeah: Neville Spearman (Jer-

tho, also has a buncha Arkham 
House titles on its list, at about 
$3-6 apiece. Their address is P.O. 
Box 75, Normandy House, St. 
Helier, Jersey, Channel Isles. 

I’m not supposed to cover 
Some oj Your Blood here because it’s 
not sf, but what the hell? It’s by 
Sturgeon, and my only objection to 
it is its lack of a resolution. A grip- 
ping character study in abnormal 
psychology, and some fine writ- 
ing — you may never order a Bloody 
Mary again. Go get it. (But you 
might not find it in the sf section.) 

Looking back, I see that most 
of this column has to do with sf in 
the past: 1976 In Review, and then 
a buncha reprints and historical 
stuff. I’d like to leave you with some- 
thing looking more toward the fu- 
ture — it seems fitting in an sf 
magazine — and fortunately just be- 
fore I began this paragraph the 
phone rang and Baen gave me my 
trailer. 

It seems that editors do so make 
good authors: for on March 9 of 
this year James Patrick Baen and 
Madeleine Louise Gleich co- 
authored a terrific six-pound 
thirteen-and-a-half-ounce short story 
called “Jessica Rachel,” which 
shows great promise of growing, in 
serialized pages, into a damned fine 
novel someday. At this point I’m 
grinning so big I’m chewing on my 
earlobes, and that’s as good an ex- 
cuse as any to shut up.

Colonel howe sat in the lander 
for 187 hours and refused to go 
EVA. Mission Control tried every 
argument and threat but he just 
wouldn’t budge. In the end they had 
to initiate an updated liftoff se- 
quence. They flew him back from 
Mars and put him in the hospital. 

He’s still there.

In the three years that have fol- 
lowed no attempt has been made to 
put another man on Mars. Colonel 
Howe recovered sufficiently in a 
few months to tell them what (he 
thought) happened out there. 

They concluded he possessed a 
sexual fixation on the Earth and had 
suffered an intense paroxysm of 
loneliness when he stayed away so 
long. 

They tried to reason with him, 
but he was perfectly reasonable. 

They tried aversion conditioning, 
but the fixation was too deep-seated. 

They did some wider testing and 
found the fixation was not peculiar 



to Major Howe. (It was in fact uni- 
versal in men and women.) 

They tried some new techniques 
on him but they started something 
that couldn't be controlled and in 
the end they lost him. 

Lieutenant Howe lay comatose in 
a hospital bed (losing weight almost 
as quickly as rank) and was con- 
veniently forgotten. 

He’s still there.

man’s office and said: ,“I want you 
to find my husband.” 

“So do I,” said Newman. “Five 
bills a day plus squawking.” 

“You may not have to squawk 
him.” 

“Why not?” Newman frowned. 
Squawktracing was expensive. Who 
could live on five bills alone? “You 
know where he is?” 

“I think so.” She was looking 
around for a place to sit down. 

“Just a minute.” Newman 
opened a drawer she couldn’t see 
into and stared thoughtfully at a 
pile of notices (Repos, Get-Outs, 
Pay-Mes, F-Os) and assorted busted 
hardware (a singed squawk insert- 
er, a deflated, battery-corroded 
SONOzap). The drawer smelled 
sour and depressing. He slammed it 
shut. “My calendar is full tomorrow 
and for the rest of the week. ...” 
“Damn it!” 

“ ’Zokay, baby. We’ll go now.” 
“Thank you.” 

Newman shrugged. “Get happy.”

It was a military hospital in the 
hills above Glendale. 

“You sure he’s in there?” 

“I think so,” she said. “I got a 
garbled phone call.” 

Newman thought that over. Dig- 
ging into Government stuff was 
borderline crazy. (And figure five 
bills and no squawking.) He shook 
his head. 



Iona looked at him. “He’s not in 
the service.” 

“It’s not who he is that bothers 
me. It’s who’s got him that hurts.” 
Newman gunned his engine to keep 
it alive (leaky carburetor). The car 
was just another cross to pack 
— primer black ’72 Camaro with 
APC blowers cleverly blocked 
off. 

Newman vented some evil-smell- 
ing salami gas, then sighed. 

“Listen (’scuse me). Miss 
Grayson, this Government thing’s 
got me going.’' 

She flashed a grin of pure hatred. 
“Ten bills a day.” 

“Yeah, I know, but — ” 

“Shut off that engine!” 

Newman turned suddenly to look 
out the side window, then burped 
painfully at the black-suited cop. 

“Ahhh. .”

Seven days ago Grayson had 
twisted his ankle climbing off an 
E-bus and limped up the boulevard 
in broad stinging daylight. He was 
still too steamed to be careful, too 
brought down to realize they’d be 
looking for him. 

He thought about calling Iona (in 
Houston), but he wasn’t ready to 
talk. 

He stepped painfully over a nod- 
ding feeb, then turned back for a 
closer look. The smiling feeb took 
no notice.

Grayson looked up and saw the

The cop reached through the win- 
dow and pointed at the ignition. 
Newman gunned the engine and put 
his slimy hands in his lap. 

“What?” 

“SHUT IT DOWN!” 

“Oh.” Newman turned the igni- 
tion key. The engine rolled and 
sputtered for ten or fifteen seconds, 
then ceased. The car stopped rock- 
ing. A miasma of half-burnt hydro- 
carbons rose up and drifted away. 

The cop said, “What year’s this 
car?” 

“Seventy-eight?” 

“It’s a seventy-two,” the cop 
said. 

“Yeah, well sure,” Newman 
said. “That’s what I, uh, said . .” 
He could feel the sweat oozing down 
his sides. “Didn’t I . .?” 

The cop consulted a small plastic 
card. Sweat rolled down his grimy 
face and dripped on the card. He 
grunted and smeared the sweat with 
a gloved thumb. “Follow me in 
your vehicle.” 

Newman looked apprehensively at 
Iona Grayson. She was scared, but 
trying hard not to show it. 

Newman turned back: “Where 
are you taking. ?” 

But the cop was gone from the 



window. In a moment he pulled out 
in front of the Camaro and 
motioned. Newman started his en- 
gine and they pulled away from the 
curb. 

“He never even looked at me,” 
Iona whispered. “Do you think he 
knows who — ?” 

“I don’t know!” Newman snap- 
ped. “Let me think!” 

Maybe they were already 
squawking him. Or her. More likely 
her. Didn’t he screen himself care- 
fully every morning? 

Well, nearly every morning. 

His sour stomach rolled and flut- 
tered. 

Damn this Government business!

One week ago Grayson (husband 
oO had limped into a vibrating 
(crunch rock) Headshop on Ventura 
Boulevard and demanded to Get 
Happy. They smiled at him and 
checked his credit and made him 
comfortable in a back room with 
nine other initiates. 

Everybody in the room suddenly 
became very nervous. Grayson 
made ten; the group was filled; the 
session would now begin. The doors 
were locked, and outside in the 
Headshop warning lights blinked 
(and were ignored). 

The Get Happy technician 
(minister) came in and smiled pro- 
fessionally throughout a short dis- 
claimer speech. Get Happy was a 



GET HAPPY

great boon to man-and-woman-kind. 
The discovery of Get Happy was the 
most significant event in the history 
of the world. Get Happy training 
was the only sane path to take in an 
insane world. Get Happy would 
solve ALL your problems. Get 
Happy was IT. (Get Happy tm was 
not responsible for monetary or 
emotional loss or damage.) 

“Tm sure you’re all eager to be- 
gin training,” the minister (techni- 
cian) said. He paused dramatically. 
“Let’s . Get Happy!”

FUSED TO COMMENT DIRECTLY ON

STATEMENT, SAYING ONLY THAT 
THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION IS 
STILL UNDERWAY.

When Newman saw the crusher, 
he knew what it was all about. They 
hadn’t recognized Iona Grayson. 
They had recognized his ’72 Cam- 
aro. 

The cop led him right up beside 
the waiting crusher and stopped. 

Newman got out and motioned to 
Iona to do the same. 

“You wouldn’t like it,” he told 
her. 

The cop spoke briefly to a dusty 
worker, then he scribbled on a card, 
handed it over, and took off. The 
worker spat and strode over to 
Newman. 

“Sign here.” 

Newman gloomily fixed his chop 
to the card. 

The worker glanced inside the 
car, then said, “Anything you want 
outta the trunk?” 

Newman thought about that. Noth- 
ing legal, anyway. He said, 
“No.” 

The worker raised her hand and 
waved. A moment later a claw 
seized the Camaro and flung it into 
the crusher. Newman turned away 
as the metal screamed and popped. 

They allowed him fifty bucks on 
the metal, then fined him fifty for 
driving an obsolete.

Newman led Iona out of the yard 
and stood by her till the cab came. 
“Tm going back to the office,” he 
said. 

“What about my husband?” 

“I won’t charge you for the car,” 
he said, smiling sickly. “That 
couldn’t be helped.”

Four days ago Grayson had 
graduated from Get Happy training 
and could apply the technique with- 
out the anaEEG paraphernalia 
hooked up. He had his constructs in 
place, his image builders operating 
well enough (without augmentation) 
to find the GH pulse and sync it. He 
was even experimenting with a 
heterodyned pattern for increased 
pressure. He was advanced. He 
could turn a corner and Get Happy 
at a moment’s notice. The thought 
was thrilling and dangerous and de- 
licious. 

He turned a corner and Got 
Happy.

Two days ago Grayson (husband 
of Iona) was apprehended by Garks 
and removed to an undisclosed lo- 
cation in Southern California. The 
man had Got (too) Happy. 

16 

Newman highstepped through the 
lobby of his building. The floor was 
crowded with refuse and sweaty 
feebs on the nod. Get Happy. 

There was somebody in his of- 
fice. A big guy. 

“Help you?” the man said, 
looking up from Newman’s desk. 

“Yeah. You busy?” 

The man was going through the 
drawers. He threw a pile of 
Get-It-Up notices on the desk, 
scraped around in the drawer for 
more, then looked at Newman and 
grinned. 

“You’re Newman." 

“That cheap son of a bitch?” 
Newman said, (pretty much) grin- 
ning back. “Not likely.” 



GET HAPPY 



135 




“Know him?” 

“Well enough to know he’ll 
never show his ass around here.” 

“Yeah?” 

“He’s running scared.” 

The big man said, “He ought to 
be.” 

Newman nodded at the desk. 
“Find anything?” 

“Nothing that works.” The big 
man leaned back and put his feet 
up. 

Newman stepped a little closer 
and shoved his hands in his pockets. 
“Suppose we both stay here and 
wait for him?” 

“Suppose 1 wait for him alone.” 

Newman made himself count 
slowly to five. 

“All right. Have it your way.” 
He turned to go. 

“By the way, Newman ...” 

“Yeah?” Newman burped and 
gagged on acid. “I mean, ‘What 
you call me?’ ” The acid was trying 
to digest his throat raw. He coughed 
and swallowed. 

“Newman,” the big man said, 
smiling horribly. “We need one 
thousand bucks by tomorrow morn- 
ing. After that another thousand ev- 
ery other day until you’re clear with 
us.” 

“Well, sure, I . .” His mouth 
was too dry to swallow; the acid 
went on burning its way through his 
neck. 

“And don’t look for me. If they 
have to send me to you again, 1 pull 
your spine out.” 

“Fair enough.” 



17 

Iona Grayson was back in the 
shimmering parking lot of the hos- 
pital and staring at the enormous 
concrete cube as if it were about to 
split wide open and reveal her hus- 
band tangled in its web. She 
click-clacked resolutely to the en- 
trance bunker. 

Someone grabbed her from be- 
hind and spun her around. 

“I’m back,” Newman said, 
panting from his run across the lot. 
He swallowed some spit, then ad- 
ded, “For twelve bills a day.” 
“No.” 

“All right, ten, like you said.” 
“No.” 

“Eight, then!” 

“No.” 

Newman cleared his throat and 

swallowed with determination. “My 
standard fee is five bills plus 

squawking.” 

“No,” she said. “I’ve decided to 
do it without you.” 

“C‘mon,” he whined, “Jesus 

Christ. FOUR!” 

She stared at him, rather too 

amused. “Three.” 

Newman bit his tongue. “You 
have no idea what you’re getting 
into here!” 

“Three.” 

“Government business is no 
swapmeet!” 

“Three.” 

“Damn it, lady, I got ferocious 
overhead!” 

“Two.” 



136

“Three’s fine!” 

“All right.” 

“Plus squawking.” 

She shook her head. “No need 
for that. I kndw he’s in there.” 
“Great.” 



18 

Yesterday Grayson was running 
his Get Happy pulse pellmell 
through a tortuous mine field of 
Government blocks and clangers. It 
was hard work, but the goal was 
right, so he persevered ten hours (he 
had nothing but time) until the pulse 
hit home and BFPC was achieved. 

Then as suddenly as he’d got 
through, he made voluntary 
breakoff. He’d touched on a PC link 
out of the past and suddenly her im- 
age filled his mind — IONA. 

Grayson lay in the hospital bed 
and blinked at the soft-lit ceiling. 
His body was gripped hard in a 
muscle field (the intensity of which 
was in negative FB to his alpha 
density; the more restless he got, 
the tighter the field held him). 

When he came out of Get Happy, 
his body shook and jumped against 
the muscle field and he almost 
reached alarm status. He instantly 
generated calming pulses. 

In five minutes his restored alpha 
waves eased the muscle tenser to the 
point where he could move around a 
little on the bed. Very carefully he 
inched his body toward the bedta- 
ble. Soon he was close enough, but 



growing excitement made it hard to 
maintain alpha control. 

He suddenly bucked his head and 
knocked a plastic water container 
over the back to the table. The wa- 
ter dumped out (ffzzz) into the 
electrical junction. 

The lights were out a full second. 

When they came back on, he was 
standing by the door. Wires and 
tubes dangled from his body. He ig- 
nored them and cracked the door for 
a peep into the hall. 

Ah, good.

Room 999 was the tomb for a 



GET HAPPY 



137 




living corpse. Wires relayed the 
corpse’s body-function data to a 
machine nobody bothered to look at 
anymore. Tubes delivered food and 
drew off the result. The corpse 
breathed. 



21 

After Grayson made his cryptic 
call to Iona (he had to wait sixteen 
hours for a safe phone), he crept 
through the nighttime building. He 
knew it would be impossible to get 
out on his own. He would have to 
remain free within the hospital until 
help arrived. He came to a door. 

Room 999. 

He couldn’t have picked a better 
place. Nobody ever came in here. A 
lot of people working at the hospital 
didn’t even know there was a Room 
999. 

Grayson peeked inside, then came 
in fast and closed the door. He was 
still the wired medusa. 

He tipped (bare) toed to the bed 
and beheld the living corpse. 

“My God,” he said. “It’s Colonel 
Howe.” 

22 

“Here’s how we'll work it,” 
Newman said. 

They sat in the parking lot in her 
rented car (’88 Mustang Square 
Deal). It was sweltering in there. 

“You go in and ask to see your 
husband.” 



“I need to pay you for that?” 

“Just do what I tell you!” 

23 

Early this morning Grayson en- 
camped in Room 999. He found 
some couplers and plugged himself 
into Howe’s feed line. 

At first it worried him. He needed 
nourishment, but was afraid to wan- 
der the halls to look for it. He was 
already rigged for intravenous, so 
that seemed natural enough. 

But he was worried they might 
notice the increased flow. For a 
moment he considered unplugging 
Howe and taking it all. 

But Howe was a national hero. 
(More like a national treasure these 
days, an object to be filed away and 
viewed rarely — nice to have around 
when you got curious.) 

But more than a public hero, 
Howe was Grayson’s personal idol. 

There was no way he could sim- 
ply unplug the man. 

(Later on he realized if they were 
watching Howe close enough to see 
an increased input flow, they’d 
probably also have noticed if his 
output slacked.) 

So Grayson plugged in the 
Y-connection and settled down on 
the floor by the head of the bed. 
From here he could quickly slide 
under the bed should someone (in 
whatever state of confusion) ap- 
proach Room 999. 

An hour later he noticed the audio 



138 



GALAXY 




jack and selector lying unused on 
Howe’s bedtable. Grayson was still 
equipped with earphones, so he 
plugged in and ran through the 
selection. 

There were three channels of 
anti-Get Happy pap, twenty-two 
television sound lines, three hospital 
intercom nets, a pair of music 
programs (classipop and crunch), 
and the news. 

Grayson sampled them all for a 
while, then settled on the news.

‘T want to see my husband. My 
name is Iona Grayson.” 

She stood alone before the desk 
in the entrance bunker. The recep- 
tionist smiled sweetly. “What name, 
please?” 

“David Randall Grayson.” 

“I’ll just see.” The receptionist 
turned to a file output screen and 



typed (blue fingernails clicking) on 
the keyboard. 

Iona stood stiffly, breathing 
loudly. Her heart pounded unbear- 
ably, and the receptionist’s perfume 
was making her sick. 

The receptionist eyeballed the 
pulsing screen, then turned and 
smiled. “I’m dreadfully sorry,” he 
said, “but we have no David Ran- 
dall Grayson on our lists.” 

Iona took a deep breath and 
forced her voice up ten ob’s: “I 
know he’s here!” (She swallowed 
hard, her mouth horribly dry.) 

The receptionist smiled, mur- 
mured, “I’m terribly sorry, Mrs. 
Grayson,” and nudged a concealed 
button with his knee. 

“You damned liar!” Iona 
screamed. 

Doors sprung open on opposite 
sides of the bunker. A guard raced 
through one, Newman the other, 
both on a collision course intersect- 
ing at Iona. 

26 

Grayson crouched beside the 
sacred bed and listened to the news. 
From time to time his mind wan- 
dered into near-feeb status and he 
retreated with a jolt. The third time 
it happened he began to wonder if 
he was losing control. 

Then he saw how casually he re- 
garded that horrible possibility, and 
he was really scared ... for a 
while.

“I want my goddamned hus- 

bandry 

The guard said, “Please — “ 
Newman jabbed the distracted re- 
ceptionist and flashed a plastic card 
in his face for about three mi- 
croseconds. “Name’s Blahblahblah, 
Air Force audio-visual. ’’ 

“Calm down,” the guard told 
Iona. 

“Excuse me?’’ The receptionist 
turned to ogle Newman. 

“Outta Norton Air Force Base?’’ 
“He’s here, 1 know it!’’ 

“Can I help?’’ 

“Don’t touch me!’’ 

“We need update footage on as- 
tronaut Howe.’’ 

“You’ll have to leave.’’ 

“Howe?” 

“For the archives, ya know?” 

“/ know he\s hereVy 
“I don’t know . .’’ 

“1 cleared it with Hospital PR 
before — ’ ’ 

“Lady, please — ’’ 

“My instructions — ’’ 

Iona began to scream. 

""Cmon, man,’’ Newman insisted. 

“Get some other guys,’’ the 
guard said. 

Iona sat down on the floor, 
screaming louder and louder. 

The receptionist turned to reach 
other hidden alarm buttons. Newman 
jabbed him repeatedly on the shoul- 
der till he snapped, “Room 999!’’ 
“Thanks.’’ 

The guard struggled with Iona, 



trying to dose her with a muscle re- 
laxant. Newman winked at her as he 
passed on his way to the elevators. 
The last thing he saw was two more 
men rushing out of the door across 
the way .... 

The elevator doors rattled to- 
gether. Up he went.

Newman stepped out on the ninth 
lloor and looked down the hall in 
both directions. 

The entire floor seemed deserted. 
No Muzak. He noticed the hall was 
not so thickly divided with doors as 
a normally populated hospital floor. 

He checked a few numbers, then 
headed down the longest corridor, 
toward what he figured had to be 
the final door. 

As long as he was up here he 
might as well get a look at Howe. 
He was halfway there when he 
heard the sound. 

Somebody was coming up fast 
behind him. 

Newman kept moving.

Newman stood in front of Room 
999 . 

“Here we are, sir,” the PR man 
said. 

Newman nodded glumly. His 
plan — to wander “helplessly” about 
and search for Grayson — was badly 



GET HAPPY 



141 




snagged by the hospital’s unex- 
pected efficiency. 

After fooling around with Howe a 
bit (he was somewhat surprised 
there really was a Colonel Howe), 
maybe he could lose the PR creep 
in the men’s room and continue his 
search. 

“Are you ready?’’ the man said. 
“I warn you, Howe is a bit of a 
shock to look at. And I’m sure he’s 
deteriorated even more in the year 
since I’ve last seen him.’’ 

Newman nodded. “Fine. Let’s go 
inside.’’

Grayson saw shadows under the 
door in the hall and quickly discon- 
nected from the audio box. He was 
slithering under the bed when the 
door opened and two nurses 
squeaked in. 

“There you are,’’ one said. 

The other smiled and tapped the 
alarm plaque on the wall. 



38 

“There he is,’’ the PR man 
crowed (sort of). 

“Colonel — excuse me — Lieu- 
tenant Howe: the only man to land 
on Mars." 

Newman looked at the thin figure 
on the bed. The resemblance was 
there, the thin nose and sharply 
rounded chin, but much of the flesh 
had melted away. The flattened 



142 



GALAXY 




chest stirred slowly in shallow, 
measured breaths. 

“When will your men — T' 

“What?" Newman said, hiding 
his confusion. 

“Your film!" crew," the PR man 
said. “When will they be — ?" 

“They’re, uh, riding in from San 
Berdoo." 

“Oh.” 

“Maybe another hour ...” 

“Of course if — ” 

“What’s he doing now?” New- 
man asked. 

Howe had opened his wide 
mouth. Now he burped loudly. 

“Does he do that often?” 

The PR man looked uncomforta- 
ble. “I’ll check.” 

He glanced quickly about the 
room, then said, “I’ll just go out in 
the hall and phone down for a 
nurse.” 

Newman watched him leave the 
room, then inched up beside Howe 
and inspected him with curiosity. 

The mouth gaped open again and 
Newman touched Howe on the chin. 

“Ahhhh ...” said Howe. 



39 

Half an hour ago they hauled 
Grayson out of Room 999 and 
downstairs to a room equipped for 
autosquawking. They didn’t want to 
lose track of him again. They didn’t 
bother to re-establish anti-Get Happy 
therapy — he seemed to be in control 
for the time being. 



But not for long. 

After they left him alone Grayson 
lost little time in finding his PC 
with a Get Happy pulse. Once again 
he Jumped out with a tactile image 
of Iona. Tears welled in his eyes. 

40 

They dragged her limp body to- 
ward the door and nearly had her 
out of the bunker when a supervisor 
happened by and demanded to know 
what they were doing to the poor 
woman. 

They told him. 

The supervisor was not happy. 
“Chrissake, you can’t just dump her 
back in her car after Flabbing her.” 

The guards shrugged. 

The supervisor frowned. “Take 
her up to the lounge and let her 
sleep it off.” 

The guards nodded sullenly and 
hauled her to the elevator. 



41 

“Ahhh,” Howe said again, and 
licked his lips. 

“Colonel Howe!” Newman said, 
grinning. “Ten/iwa/?!” 

Howe opened his eyes and 
blinked. 

Newman whispered, “Jesus 
Christ.” 

Howe sighed long and loud, 
swallowed twice, and said, “Well, 
that’s that.” 



GET HAPPY 



143 




42 

Iona woke up on a cold plastic 
couch in an empty room. She stood 
up and walked shakily to the door. 

Fifty feet down the hall she found 
a terminal and typed the question. 
The screen flashed the answer with- 
out hesitation: *614 

Iona took the elevator to the sixth 
floor. 



43 

Grayson couldn’t move his hands 
to wipe the tears from his eyes. Af- 
ter a while they dried on his cheeks. 

He felt a strong urge to Get 
Happy but he suppressed it with all 
his strength. He had to remain alert 
in case help wandered in. Help . 

Damn it, he mouthed. 

It was hopeless . 

But he would fight, damn it, he 
would fi — 

GET HAPPY 

The order came from deep inside 
and it was more than an order — it 
was a fact. 

His subconscious, doubly frus- 
trated the last few days, searched till 
it found its own Get Happy pulse. 

Grayson’s body shuddered into 
BFPC with a vengeance. Enormous 
waves of pure pleasure thundered 
through his system, an irresistibly 
sweet flood of ecstatic energy that 



washed out all blocks and doubts. 

He was not bitter that he’d lost. 

He was not even appalled by the 
realization he was out of control. He 
rejoiced openly that the dam had fi- 
nally broken. Isn’t this what he had 
really craved all along? Isn’t this 
what makes life worth living? Isn’t 
this all there is? 

He was purely, overwhelmingly, 
incontrovertibly happy. 

And the best part — he knew it 
would last forever!

GALAXY 




On a normal MONDAY moming, 
ships docked in Houston, New 
York, Oakland, New Orleans. Bar- 
bers raised the blinds in Pittsburgh. 
Wives woke already tired. The trees 
of Aspen felt an unusual stillness in 
the air. 

In the White House, Captain 
Michael James of the Office of Sci- 
ence and Technology poured him- 
self a second huge cup of black cof- 
fee, gave it three spoons of sugar 
and started flipping through the 
mail. It was James’ second tour; he 
had been a White House Fellow the 
first time through, then a stint at the 
Pentagon, over to Rand, then back 
in with the new Administration two 
years ago. There was a letter with 
no stamp and no return address. 

In California, Inspector Bob Tan- 
ner stepped out of the Customs shed 
of Oakland’s vast Seventh Street 
Terminal with his first cup of cof- 
fee, squinting in the morning light 
that poured across what could have 
been miles of asphalt. The terminal 
had the dimensions of an aero- 
drome. Everything was outsize — the 
cargo sheds, the towering cranes 
that could turn a ship around in 
eight hours. The containerships 
themselves were monstrous, the 
forty-foot containers stacked high 
on their decks like fish tins in a 
market. Tanner was a short man, 
muscular, maybe a little too muscu- 
lar for the neat blue Customs suit, 
his face broad and pink, his thin 
hair neatly combed over his pate. 
He felt the top of his head gingerly. 



Time to get to work. It would be a 
busy day — a Monday, and two guys 
out sick. At the far end of the as- 
phalt he could see an ancient black 
Victory ship moving slowly into 
place, its sides streaked with rust, 
containers piled precariously on the 
tiny decks. The bow said, “dar.” 
Captain James was at his desk. 
He looked at the note, his heavy 
brows pulled together in thought. A 
tipsy woman at a party had told him 
once that he was so thin and his 
eyes were so big that he looked like 
a praying mantis. Well. He took 
another long swallow of coffee. The 
note said: 

Dear Captain James: 

Please inform the President 
that he is to surrender the coun- 
try by 9 p.M. EST Tuesday. If 
he fails to do so, the country will 
be in great danger. 

It was neatly typed on white 
bond, no letterhead, no signature. 
No stamp. No return address. Why 
would anyone send a note like that 
to me? he wondered. He shoved it 
in an interoffice envelope, marked 
the envelope “Secret Service’’ and 
dropped it in the “out-message’’ 
box. Some nut. 

“Break that seal, would you? 
Let’s have a look inside.’’ Inspector 
Tanner looked over the “dar’’ 
manifest. Mostly frozen goods. 
Shrimp. Container after cold con- 
tainer was coming off the creak- 
ing old ship and being mated di- 
rectly with the rigs that would carry 
them inland. Panamanian registry.

Norwegian crew. Modified, God 
knows how, for refrigerated con- 
tainers, “reefers.” Stops all over 
East Asia. The driver swung the 
container’s "doors open. Boxes, floor 
to ceiling, markings in Chinese and 
English. Tanner pulled out a knife 
and swung himself up beside the 
boxes. Quickly he cut a hole in one 
box and slit the plastic bag inside. 
A half-dozen tiny pink shrimp fell 
out. He produced a flashlight and, 
hoisting himself precariously on one 
toehold, peered over the top of the 
stack. The boxes faded uniformly 
into blackness. They filled the 
whole truck. He slapped his meaty 
hand on some of the boxes within 
reach to see if any were hollow. He 
got down carefully, puffing. 

“You want to check the side?” 
asked the driver, a young, rangy 
sort in cowboy boots, jeans and an 
immaculate T-shirt. 

Tanner glanced at the waiting line 
of trucks. “Nah. Take it out. Go 
ahead,” he said, signing the Cus- 
toms release and gate pass. He 
looked through the remaining 
forms. The top six, at least, were 
shrimp, each one to a different 
place. Behind him the jockey was 
slamming the door to, securing 
latches, thunking the tires, whistling 
a tune that was wild and insupport- 
ably sad. 

★ ★ ★ 

Time to beat it. Captain James 
swung his jacket on, adjusted his tie 



in the mirror. He’d had the uniform 
altered for his thin figure. Praying 
mantis. The phone rang. He 
snorted, and took one more look in 
profile as the phone rang again. 

It was Belk, in the Secret Serv- 
ice. 

“Good, glad I caught you,” said 
Belk, his voice thin on the wire. 
James could imagine Belk standing, 
leaning on his desk, not drumming 
his fingers while he talked. All 
those guys in the S.S. made him 
nervous. They were as cool as 
cheetahs, no nervous habits, quiet, 
never tired. 

“Glad I caught you. Got just one 
question for you before you slip 
out.” 

“Yeah?” 

“Yeah, that threat, or whatever it 
was, that you sent over. How’d it 
come in? There’s no stamp on it.” 
“I know. But it was in with the 
regular mail.” 

“In the mail bag?” 

“I guess so. It was just on my 
desk.” 

Belk didn’t answer. James 
couldn’t hear him breathe. 

“With the other mail.” 
“Uh-huh.” Another silence. 
Maybe he was writing. “Uh-huh. 
Okay. Appreciate it.” 

“Anything happening? You guys 
have any idea why someone would 
send a note like that to me?” 

“No. No. This is all routine. 
Thanks.” And he clicked off. 

James put the phone down 
slowly, looking at the door.

“Where you headed, Dan?” 

The young trucker looked up 
from his coffee and his face broke 
into a grin. “Spark! I didn’t see 
you.” 

The waitress smiled back. “Just 
came on. I work nights now.” Her 
plastic name tag said, “Jane,” but 
she smiled when the truckers called 
her “Spark.” She was their friend. 
“Where you headed?” 

“The usual. Salt Lake. Whole 
thing’s full of frozen shrimp.” 
“Shrimp?” She peered out the 
window at Dan’s big White 
Freightliner parked under the lights. 

“How’s things in Winnemucca? 
Gettin’ lonely yet?” 

“Oh, gettin.’ ” She wiped the 
counter. “Why, you got plans?” 
“Oh,” he said, grinning into his 
cup, “not big ones.” 

★ ★ ★ 

The next evening the phone rang 
in Captain James’ apartment. He 
put down the article on bioglass he 
had been reading over the remains 
of dinner and looked at his watch: 
9:37. The phone rang again before 
he got to it. 

It was Ashe, one of the Presi- 
dent’s men. Ashe had a high, cut- 
ting voice and a reputation as a 
political thinker of considerable sub- 
tlety. 

“The Boss wants to talk to you.” 
“Now?” 

150 



“Soon as you can get down 
here.” 

“What’s up?” 

“Wouldn’t tell you if I could. 
We’ll be in the BOB. Right?” 

“O.K.” 

★ ★ ★ 

A Mack with a reefer from New 
Orleans rolled through Sweetwater, 
Tennessee. In Albuquerque a night 
receiver at an SP warehouse signed 
a receipt for a reefer from Galves- 
ton. In Limon, Colorado, a baby 
whimpered in its sleep while its 
mother and father fought in the next 
room. The father began to feel des- 
perate and alone; he felt everything 
that he thought he was begin to 
wash away. 

★ ★ ★ 

Captain James was not a politi- 
cian. He never felt hungry enough. 
But he felt a connoisseur’s apprecia- 
tion for the arcane machinations of 
power. His was a technical mind, 
and political interplay carried for 
him the same floral beauty as, say, 
the brief lives of quarks or the 
barely imaginable turmoils of black 
holes in space. It was this apprecia- 
tion that had brought him back to 
the White House and that brought 
his senses keenly to life as he step- 
ped into the comfortable working 
office of the President in the Execu- 
tive Office Building. 

The President was leaning against 

GALAXY 




the desk. “Captain James,” he 
said, smiling warmly. “Sit down. I 
believe you know Bob Ashe. And 
John Tines.” Ashe was small and 
dark, had a face like a hatchet, a 
surprisingly slovenly man. Tines, 
the Press Secretary, had cut his 
teeth covering the movements of the 
Sixties for the Times', he was a 
large, round man, with a full, 
brown moustache. “We have a 
quick decision to make,” the Presi- 
dent went on. “We need the best 
kind of technical information and 
advice, but we don’t have time to 
go to the departments. Besides, we 
can’t afford a leak. Since you are 
highly recommended, both as a 
technical mind, and as an honest 
and,” he paused, ''loyal member of 
the team, we asked you down. We 
need those qualities right now.” 

James sat down, a little over- 
come. The President’s reputation for 
personal charm did little to blunt the 
effect of an actual meeting. 
“What’s happened?” he asked. 

Ashe said, “Let me ask you a 
few factual questions, Mike. What’s 
happening at Wharton, Illinois?” 

“Wharton, Illinois?” The dis- 
connectedness of the question was 
breathtaking. “Wharton? Nothing 
that I know of. A lot of farms. I 
remember there’s a silage concern. 
And a trucking warehouse on the 
edge of town. Why?” 

“Pentagon have anything there?” 

“No.” 

“No hard sites, armories, depots, 
Minutemen?” 



“Rand have anything? Is there 
anything scientific out there at all? 
Labs, reactors, anything?” 

“No. Why?” 

“How sure are you?” 

“Positive.” 

Ashe lapsed into silence, staring 
at his fingertips. The President said, 
“There was an explosion there 
about an hour ago. A nuclear explo- 
sion of some kind.” 

“A nuclear explosion?” echoed 
James. “How big?” 

“Not big the way those things 
go, I guess,” said Ashe. “Leveled 
half the town, maybe all of it. But 
it was a small town. We’ve got 
maybe a hundred or so dead out 
there.” 

“The main thing is, it was nu- 
clear, and the word’s getting around. 
We’ve got to put out some kind of 
statement soon. And we haven’t the 
foggiest where the thing came 
from.” 

“Well, we have some guesses,” 
said Ashe, ticking them off on his 
fingers. “Look, it’s either ours or 
someone else’s. It can’t be someone 
else’s. You couldn’t even sneak a 
cruise missile all the way in to 
Wharton, Illinois, without someone 
at least hearing the thing. Let alone 
a bomber or an ICBM. Besides, 
who would want to bomb Wharton, 
Illinois? So it must be ours. And 
since there’s nothing there, reactors 
or hard sites or anything like that, it 
must have been something being 
moved through Wharton. So like I 



COMING HOME

said before, it was probably a freak 
accident involving the transportation 
of a low-yield fission warhead.” 

“Should we put that out, then, 
sir?” asked Tines. “People are 
going to get real nasty. We should 
put out something soon.” 

“Hold on,” said James. “Sir, 
you said an hour ago? That would 
be 9:40?” 

“Well. .” The President picked 
up a cable. “No. It was 9:07 our 
time, 8:07 local. Why? Does that 
mean something to you?” 

“Maybe, maybe not. But I think 
you ought to talk to Belk in the Se- 
cret Service.” 

“Why?” asked Ashe. 

“He has a note that I received 
today from some nut, demanding 
that you surrender the country by 9 
p.M. or something drastic would 
happen.” 

The President smiled. Ashe 
grinned and asked, “Did they 
threaten to blow up Wharton, Il- 
linois? They really had us by the 
short hairs.” 

Tines said, “Sounds like a coin- 
cidence to me. They get these notes 
all the time. This one just happened 
to name a time that coincided with 
a freak accident. People don’t just 
make atomic weapons in their back- 
yards. ” 

The room was quiet for a mo- 
ment before Ashe spoke. “Maybe. 
There’s just one little thing. You 
say the letter was addressed to 
you?” 

James said, “Yes.” 



“Why?” 

“Why?” 

“Why was it addressed to you 
and not to the Boss, like most of 
those crank notes are? There’s a 
connection that is escaping me.” 
“Well,” said the President 
quietly, “since Captain James is our 
technical man, maybe whoever sent 
the note felt that he would have 
technical knowledge that would 
somehow authenticate the note. 
What do you think. Captain? Does 
the idea suggest anything to you?” 
“Well, the note didn’t say what 
would happen if we didn’t surren- 
der. But if the note is connected in 
some way to this explosion, I can 
tell you that some of your assump- 
tions are pretty shaky.” 

“How’s that?” said Ashe. 

“Well, you wouldn’t necessarily 
need a bomber or a missile to get a 
low-yield fission device to the mid- 
dle of Illinois.” 

“Oh? How would you get it 
there?” asked Ashe. “Assuming 
you had one.” 

“Carry it. Or put it on 
Greyhound.” 

“What?” cried Tines. 

“Come on now,” said Ashe, 
“we’re talking about an atom 
bomb.” 

“Right,” said James, his blood 
suddenly pumping audibly. “The 
critical mass for plutonium is about 
thirty-four pounds. With shielding, 
control mechanisms and all, the 
smallest atom bomb might weigh 
less than seventy-five pounds.” 



152 



GALAXY 




“Jesus!” exclaimed Ashe. “And 
with that you could blow up what? 
A city?” 

“No. A football stadium. A few 
hundred pounds more could do in a 
city.” 

Tines asked, “So how could they 
get it in the country?” 

“I frankly don’t know. But 
things larger than that are smuggled 
into the country all the time. And it 
could be brought in pieces.” 

“With this much at stake, I’m 
sure people can be quite clever,” 
said Ashe. “It makes me think of 
Prohibition.” 

“It wouldn’t even have to be 
from overseas,” said James. “This 
could be ‘home-brew.’ The theory 
of fission is well understood, and 
the construction problems are not 
insurmountable. In fact, four years 
ago a graduate student in Syracuse 
did build one in his backyard. It 
was a complete, working model. 
All it lacked was the plutonium.” 

The President walked behind the 
desk and sat down. “All right. So 
if some psychotic, or the Syndicate, 
or somebody, wanted to build a 
bomb, or wanted to hire someone to 
build one, it wouldn’t be a big 
problem. But where would they get 
the plutonium?” 

“I’m just guessing still, sir, but, 
not counting foreign sources that 
might be perfectly willing, for their 
own reasons, to smuggle some in to 
them, there are lots of places to get 
it within our own system. We lose 
enough each year, just in industrial 



transportation of the stuff, to make 
it feasible.” 

“Lose? How much do we lose?” 
The President’s voice had an edge 
on it. “How do we lose it?” 

“I don’t know, sir. Those guys 
over at the NRC are pretty shy on 
this point, and I’m not sure even 
they know how much. But the 
amount that is lost in the shuffle 
every year is quite sufficient to pro- 
vide for a project like this. You 
may remember a memo on nuclear 
security that I sent you in March. 
The amount of material that we ship 
from government plants to both 
foreign and domestic reactors and 
labs is simply enormous.” 

“Mike, this is very important. Is 
the amount lost sufficient for more 
than one device?” 

“Yes, sir. Besides, sir, that’s 
only one source. You may recall the 
memo mentioned as well the appall- 
ing security at our overseas 
stockpiles of tactical weapons. I 
mentioned one place, for instance, 
where nuclear howitzer shells, only 
eight inches wide and a few feet 
long, were stacked in the Embassy 
basement next to the wine! There 
was a guard, a local, but he had 
been hired that day. I had hoped 
that you had read the memo, sir. I 
thought it important at the time.” 
“So what you’re saying,” said 
the President, “is that we can’t 
necessarily know whose it is, where 
it came from, or whether there are 
more to come?” He sounded very 
tired. 



COMING HOME 



153 




“That’s about it, sir.’’ 

Tines said, “We do need some- 
thing to put out.’’ When no one 
spoke he added, “Maybe in the ab- 
sence of any clearer idea, we should 
just put out the military-accident 
theory, but with noncommital 
wording.’’ 

Still no one responded. Tines 
said, “Sir?’’ 

The President said, “Maybe we’ll 
have to. What do you think. Bob?’’ 
Ashe tapped his knuckles on the 
coffee table and said, “Okay, 
we’ve got to do something. But 
I’m not sure that’s it. We’ve got to 
keep our eye on the election; it’s 
only a few weeks off.’’ Ashe 
looked at James and shook his 
head. “You handed us a big one. 
Boss, you’re Commander-In-Chief, 
so we can’t say it’s a military acci- 
dent. It would make us look sloppy, 
incompetent, cost us votes. And we 
sure as hell can’t let people think it 
was a foreign military action of any 
sort. That would be even worse.’’ 
“What’s your idea?” asked the 
President. 

“What makes you think I have 
one?” 

“You do. Out with it.” 

Ashe laughed. “Maybe I’ve got a 
little lick of an idea. Look, we 
don’t have much information. So 
we’d better stick with the info we 
do have and come up with some- 
thing that will cover all bases, 
something we at least know we 
won’t have to take back.” He 
paused, tapping the table. “You 

154 



remember what happened to Nixon 
in the 1970 Congressional elections? 
I’ll bet you remember this one, 
John. Two nights before the polls 
opened, he was in San Jose. There 
were demonstrators, some name- 
calling, and someone supposedly 
threw a rock at him. That could 
have looked very bad. That could 
have been a demonstration that the 
Republicans were unpopular, that 
they couldn’t hold the country to- 
gether, that people wanted a 
change. But the next night he 
showed up in Phoenix with Barry 
Gold water at his side, and he gave 
a hell of a speech. It was a flag- 
waver. It played up the incident 
big, blamed it on the radicals, the 
forces of disunity, all those opposed 
to his Presidency. Of course, that 
included the Democrats. And he 
held out the Republican Party as 
one champion of law and order 
against such outrages. You re- 
member that speech. It was carried 
nationwide and coordinated with a 
blitz of full-page ads in all the big 
papers. It all worked so well some 
people later thought he might have 
hired the rock-thrower himself.” 

“And it worked?” asked the 
President. 

“Seemed to. They did better than 
they were supposed to.” 

The President spread his fingers 
on the desk top. “Is that what you 
suggest?” 

“Something like it.” Ashe was 
leaning forward now, creating the 
scene with vivid gestures. “Draw 



GALAXY 




up the wagons. Declare an 
emergency. Alert all reserve units. 
Fly the 82nd Airborne into Illinois. 
Big show. Lots of noise and press. 
Make a speech on the networks to 
calm the voters. Outline the steps 
being taken. Say that you cannot 
reveal what the investigation has 
uncovered, then hint at a radical 
threat, an attempt to subvert the 
Constitution and bring anarchy to 
America. Paint a dark picture and 
ask the people to give you the back- 
ing you need in this crisis. The tim- 
ing of all this is very important. We 
have to prolong the crisis atmos- 
phere, if it is to have its greatest ef- 
fect, until the election. We’ll find 
some rabbit to pull out of a hat the 
night before.” 

There was a silence. 

The President asked, “What if 
this gets worse? What if there are 
more bombs?” 

“If there are more bombs? If you 
make that speech, more bombs 
would just play into our hands, get 
the people more excited and afraid, 
make them look to you for a show 
of leadership.” 

“Okay, what if we make all this 
noise and nothing happens? No 
more bombs?” 

“Then the night before the elec- 
tion, when we’re sure there aren’t 
going to be any more, you’ll make 
one more speech in which you 
manage to take credit for the fact 
that the Administration’s swift ac- 
tion stopped the wave of terrorism. 
It’ll all work out, either way.” 



A wry smile tugged at the corners 
of the President’s mouth. “Okay. 
I’ll do a Dick Nixon imitation. 
What was that thing that Kennedy 
quoted about riding the back of the 
tiger? You end up inside? Well, 
we’ll ride just this one tiger. Make 
a draft. Get it to me soon. John, 
you can tell them we’ll have a pre- 
liminary statement at 1 a.m. And 
ask the networks for air time at 
eight tomorrow. Mike, thanks for 
coming.” He came around the desk 
to give James a warm handshake. 
“If you get another note, bring it to 
me.” He was smiling.

After a bad night, a missed

his sweet coffee from its huge mug 
and let his mind go blank from the 
rest of the world. It was restful. 

When the mail came he went on

struck him — there might be another 
note! 

And there was. 

Just like before, there was no 
stamp or return address. He tore it 
open. 

“A coastal town will be next. 
You have until 9 p.m. EST.” 

No signature. James picked up 
the phone. “This is Captain James.

important.’’ His voice went thin and 
reedy on the last words. 

« « 

The country was wound up. At 
Dan’s, on the south side of Colum- 
bus, Missouri, Dan dried his hands 
for the umpteenth time and watched 
his customers. People weren’t ready 
to shake and beg, run for the hills, 
hit the button. But they were drink- 
ing slowly, with something like de- 
termination. They were tired. After 
all, Wharton was simply too much. 
Just before seven, some more 
neighborhood people came in. Dan 
turned up the T.V. First there was 
Roger Mudd, then there was the 
President. He spoke very seriously, 
but in a warm, brave way that in- 
cluded them all, made them feel a 
little warmer and braver themselves. 
He reassured them about the pro- 
gress of the investigation at Wharton. 
He announced that he had activated 
the National Guard in all twenty- 
three maritime states as a demon- 
stration of the Administration’s 
willingness to deal directly with 



radical scare tactics. He urged them to 
give him a Congress that would help 
him stand up for the country, one 
that wouldn’t cave in to extremism. 

It was a good speech. People 
perked up a lot afterward. Dan liked 
that.

Captain James woke. Ashe was 
shaking him. James remembered 
where he was: he had stayed at 
work in case anything happened, 
but he must have dozed off on a 
couch. Ashe was pale. “Wake up, 
boy,’’ he said. “Crescent City, 
California, is no longer with us.’’ 

* ir * 

That was on the wires, and the 
people who heard about it when the 
T.V. programs were interrupted 
went and told the others. There was 
a numb feeling, and the mouth of 
America went dry. There was no 
communication coming out of the 
area, and the Air Force had rapidly 
sealed off the area, so the commen- 
tators went on about what Crescent 
City had been like, how big it had 
been, how the first reports had 
come in from Eureka and Coos 
Bay. Now and then they switched 
to the White House lawn, where 
another reporter would tell the cam- 
era of the important men who had 
been arriving, and how they had 
looked and acted. Many people left 
their televisions and went for walks.

not going anywhere, but unable to 
stay home. The streets were full of 
people who walked and did not 
shout. 

Through the , night the Presi- 
dent’s men talked. There were the 
figures from the Air Force, the es- 
timate pegged at a 10-K fission de- 
vice, still small and crude by 
strategic standards, but much larger 
than the Illinois device. The Air 
Force estimate of the dead started at 
five thousand. It rose to fifty-five 
hundred, then abruptly to seven 
thousand. The town was completely 
gone. At midnight Captain James 
had found a third note on his door. 
It was simply a list of cities: ‘M. 
New York, 2. Chicago, 3. San 
Francisco. .” and so on through 
“14. New Orleans. Pick one.” It 
was typed the same way, on the 
same kind of paper. 

So that was the argument. Penta- 
gon brass showed up. Senators. 
Everybody had a plan. Was the note 
a bluff? Could they plant an even 
bigger one right in the middle of 
Harlem or Chinatown? How many 
dead would that mean? Seventy 
thousand? A quarter million? Maybe 
it was a bluff, maybe they only had 
the two that they had already used. 
They couldn’t blow up a whole 
city. Who the hell were they, any- 
way? Look, we’d just have to risk 
it. A country that had gone through 
so much to preserve its way of life 
couldn’t give in to a couple of ter- 
rorist bombs. We’ve got to stand up 
to them. The President himself was 



the quietest. Just listening, his 
mouth twisted by some impact, his 
eyes burning with a strange light. It 
was Ashe, the Machiavellian cal- 
culator, who finally said the obvi- 
ous: “Boss, we’re sunk. Look, 
maybe it’s a bluff. But we can’t bet 
maybe a quarter million people on 
it. If we surrender, at least the 
enemy will show themselves and 
then we can do something. But we 
can’t just dare them to prove that 
they have a third one. Besides, if 
they do have a third one, are we 
going to bet again that there isn’t a 
fourth one?” 

★ ★ ★ 

At six A.M. (three a.m. in 
California) the nation was already 
glued to the blue-gray light of its 
screens when the President, broken 
and struggling, invited the con- 
querors, whoever they were, to 
come and take what they wanted. 
All National Guard units in place 
were to remain there. The other 
twenty-seven states were requested 
to deploy their Guards to maintain 
order in the next twenty-four hours 
and to assist local authorities in 
dealing with the rioting and looting 
already taking place in some cities. 
In Naples, Florida, a one-time 
vaudevillian shook her small fist at 
the screen and cursed, over and 
over, until her white curls shook and 
she dissolved in tears. A warehouse 
guard in Albuquerque sat outside in 
the crisp dark with his transistor

radio, watching the first light of 
false dawn spread into the deep 
shell of stars. 



★ ★ ★ 



So they waited on the White 
House lawn, T.V. crews and all the 
rest, waiting in an odd silence, the 
President, the Secretary of State, 
Ashe. Everybody. There were huge 
crowds outside the iron fence, 
standing in the same immense si- 
lence. James could see the crowds 
stretching for blocks in the haze. 
Everyone was wilted in the unsea- 
sonal sun, and the damp morning of 
Washington rose around them as 
they shaded their eyes and searched 
the sky. White House communica- 



tions had established radio contact, 
then Andrews had picked it up on 
radar. A lone helicopter. It had one 
message: all the bombs were still in 
place. If anything went wrong, they 
would go off independently 
whenever their clocks ran out. So 
the President had ordered the 
sharpshooters to hold their fire, no 
matter what. 



★ ★ ★ 



It was a dot that one person saw, 
then another. It grew swiftly, com- 
ing in from the southeast. Before 
long it was clear that it was a big 
ship. It looked to James now like a 
Navy CH-53, but it was painted red, 
white and blue, stars and stripes. It 
dropped rapidly, slowed, then set- 
tled deftly onto the lawn. White 
House guards rolled out a red carpet 
under the still-turning blades. 
People held their hats, the whine of 
the turbine settled and lost pitch. 
Guards rolled steps up to the 
strange craft just as the main hatch 
swung open and a man stepped out 
on the steps, smiling, waving, his 
fingers spread in V’s. James was 
startled by the familiar figure. He 
looked at the President. The Presi- 
dent’s face was unreadable, filled 
with tears, wrenched into horrible 
expressions. The rotor blades had 
stopped. The new Leader strode 
confidently down the steps and 
walked toward the President. His 
trip from California did not seem to 
have tired him. ★

How the Science Fiction Book Club Works: 



Cut along 
line and 
mail — 
no postage 
necessary! 



When your application for membership is 
accepted, you’ll receive your introductory 
package of four books for just 100, plus 
shipping and handling. You may examine 
them in your home, and if not completely 
satisfied, return them within ten days — 
membership will be cancelled and you’ll 
owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), 
we’ll send you the Club’s bulletin, Things 
to Come, describing the 2 coming Selec- 
tions and a variety of Alternate choices. 
If you want both Selections, you need do 
nothing; they’ll be shipped automatically. 
If you don’t want a Selection, or prefer 
an Alternate, or no book at all, just fill 
out the convenient form always provided, 
and return it to us by the date specified. 
We try to allow you at least ten days for 
making your decision. If you do not re- 
ceive the form in time to respond within 
10 days, and receive an unwanted Selec- 
tion, you may return it at our expense. 

As a member you need take only 4 Selec- 
tions or Alternates during the coming 
year. You may resign any time thereafter, 
or remain a member as long as you wish. 
At least one of the two Selections each 
month is only $1.98 plus shipping and 
handling. Other extra-value Selections are 
slightly higher but always much less than
