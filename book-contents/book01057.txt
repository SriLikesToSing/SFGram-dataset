GENIACS FOR A SONG! 

Other people may need enormous machines at great expense to 
compose music but our GENIACS do the job for only $19.95. 



The special booklet of Instructions was developed by a cus- 
tomer (only 16 years old at the time) who learned to design 
computers from the GENIAC he bought. If you feel like 
singing a new tune while the mid-summer madness is on 
you, rush us an order for a GENIAC. 

GENIAC the Electric Brain Construction Kit is a com- 
plete course (Beven books and manuals) plus all the parts 
(over 400 components and pieces of equipment including a 
display rack, special switches, etc.) for making forty diJTer- 
erent computing, reasoning, music composing and game- 
playing machines. 

Already in use by hundreds of schools, colleges, profes- 
sional scientists, amateurs and students GENIAC teaches 
you thow to build simple computers from scratch — gives you 
all the parts and know-how with wiring diagrams and step- 
by-step instructions. When you have completed all the ex- 
periments in our manuals, and studied the texts you can 
actually design new machines. 

GENIACS are easy to build, require no soldering, oper- 
ate on a flashlight battery and when you are finished with 
those in the manual you can build your own (we have a 
contest, too, for the best designs). 




Geniae set up to solve problem in 
space ship engineering.

HYPERSPEED READING 

... for me this meant increasing my reading speed 
from 600 to 1800 words per minute, enough to finish a 
hovel in half an hour, to triple the number of technical 
journals and reports I read. Much to my surprise my 
comprehension went up and studying became easier as 
1 enjoyed reading more. 

I went from normal reading speed to hyperspeed 
reading in thirty hours of intensive reading practice at 
a leading reading clinic, and immediately thought how 
wonderful it would be for people who don’t have the 
time or opportunity to take such improvement work to 
do it at home, for several hours a day. 

Ever since then I have gathered materials which are 
proven, widely used and time-tested in clinics, schools 



and reading centers but are adaptable to use by adults 
working at home without supervision. You will imme- 
diately increase your reading speed with them if your 
reading habits are correct but can be accelerated, with 
practice. 

If you have reading difficulties they will be brought 
out in the diagnostic reading test we include and will 
analyze with recommendations at no extra cost to you. 

The kit includes a reading rate accelerator with cards, 
two books of practice materials with technical exercises 
that test reading speed and comprehension, and a book- 
let on hyperspeed reading. 

Price of kit including reading rate accelerator, basic 
manual, technical reading manual, and discussion of 
hyperspeed reading plus diagnostic reading test with 
analysis. Kit Rl $24.00 poatpaid

CALL TO ARMS 



D SCHUYLER Miller, book- 
• reviewer and author, recent- 
ly fired this (abridged) broadside 
letter : 

“I want a crusade. 

“I’m basing this call on two 
axioms and an opinion: 

“A. Unless science fiction maga- 
zines are published, we can’t sell 
to them. 

“B. Unless the magazines are 
sold, they won’t be published. 

“C. From where I sit, the dis- 
tributors are not even trying to 
sell the three top-flight magazines, 
and the same is increasingly true 
of all the rest. 

“None of this makes any kind of 
sense to me, economically. I don’t 
know how distributors make a liv- 
ing if they don’t bother to dis- 
tribute. If you ask the distributors 
why they don’t put the new maga- 
zines on sale, they’ll blandly deny 
that they don’t. 

“The only answer is some sys- 
tematic fact-finding so we’ll have 
some concrete data for the pub- 
lishers.” 

Miller then reports in detail the 
results of some strolling around 

6 



town trying to buy his favorite 
magazines. As a reader, he was 
frustrated and angered. As a writer, 
he was appalled by a degree of in- 
efficiency that in any other busi- 
ness would be rewarded by thor- 
oughly deserved bankruptcy. 

In case you’re puzzled by the 
setup, or wonder why publishers 
seem to tolerate an intolerable 
situation, here’s the way it works: 

Very few publishers have distri- 
bution departments. (Because of 
the cost of road crews to cover al- 
most 100,000 stands, even the big- 
est have to spread expenses by dis- 
tributing for other houses.) Self- 
distributing or distributing through 
someone else, it makes little dif- 
ference— the number of echelons 
resembles terraced mountain rice- 
paddies. 

The distributors work through 
wholesalers, who cover territories 
either on their own or through 
smaller local wholesalers; the 
wholesalers have salesmen and/or 
truck drivers who double as sales- 
men; and so forth down the line 
to the newsstand owner, who can 
make a good thing of carrying 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



magazines by having attractive dis- 
plays, noting which ones the cus- 
tomers want, or the opposite, con- 
sidering the whole thing a nuisance 
accommodation. 

Miller gives an example of this 
kind of myopia by quoting a book- 
store/card shop owner as saying 
that “no downtown store can af- 
ford to waste shelf room on maga- 
zines because the margin is so 
small.” The margin is actually a 
very handsome one, especially if 
you consider that the whole opera- 
tion is on a consignment basis— the 
dealer pays only for copies sold. 
And unless this gent has a phe- 
nomenal business, I’d bet that 
many city stores, by doing a real 
job with their stock, net more on 
magazine sales alone than he 
grosses on all he carries. 

Miller says he heard from a 
wholesaler that “it cost them less 
in bookkeeping to put all the 
copies they got of a given issue in 
one or two places, instead of try- 
ing to distribute to all outlets.” The 
wholesaler also admitted that, 
when they were rushed, they would 
distribute the total shipment in 
one town and not bother to bring 
any to the next town at all. 

“Somewhere, the economics of 
the situation have gone screwy. 
The proprietors who do care what 
they get, and what their regular 
customers want, get no satisfac- 
tion from the wholesaler. I can’t 
understand the logic of what is 



happening. When I can’t get As- 
tounding, Galaxy and F&SF, 
month after month, something is 
very wrong.” 

And so Miller calls for a crusade 
of readers and writers to clean up 
the distribution mess. It was bad 
enough when he issued his procla- 
mation. It’s worse now as a result 
of American News Company’s — 
no, you can’t say demise. For gen- 
erations, this mindless behemoth 
dominated magazine distribution 
by sheer bulk alone; like the dino- 
saurs, rather than dying, it became 
extinct. In the long run, this will 
be a boon— distribution is bound 
to get more active, intelligent and 
alert. 

But that long run may prove 
too long for publishers of science 
fiction, without the help of readers 
and writers. 

What does a letter like Miller’s 
accomplish? We turned it over to 
our distributor — and enough copies 
of Galaxy are being sent into the 
area to insure that nobody will 
have to hunt for one. 

With your help, the same could 
be true of your town. And you 
would, at the same time, enable 
us to go on publishing top-level 
material, which we couldn’t afford 
if sales went down. We want to 
know how we are doing where you 
live— but we’ll also pass on infor- 
mation relating to other maga- 
zines.

CALI TO ARMS

Morning After 



By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



Illustrated by BOWMAN 




S LOWLY and unwillingly, 
Piersen recovered con- 
sciousness. He lay on his 
back, eyes tightly closed, trying 
to postpone the inevitable awak- 
ening. But consciousness re- 
turned and brought sensation 

8 



with it. Needles of pain stabbed 
at his eyeballs and the base of 
his skull began to pound like a 
giant heart. His joints seemed to 
be on fire and his stomach was 
a deep well of nausea. 

It was no relief for him to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



What was he doing here? Would he live or die? 

For the answers to these and other questions , 
Piersen had to keep tuning in on a hangover! 




realize that he was suffering 
from the absolute king and em- 
peror of all hangovers. 

Piersen had considerable 
knowledge of hangovers. He had 
experienced most of them in his 
time— the alcohol jitters, the mi- 



niscarette depressions, the triple 
skliti nerve ache. But this hang- 
over felt like a combination and 
intensification of them all, with 
heroin withdrawal symptoms 
thrown in for good measure. 

What had he been drinking 



MORNING AFTER 



9 



last night? And where? He tried 
to remember, but last night, like 
so many nights in his life, was a 
featureless blur. He would have 
to reconstruct it, as usual, piece 
by piece. 

Well, he decided, it was time 
to do the manly thing. Time to 
open his eyes, get out of bed and 
walk bravely to the medicine 
chest. A hypo of di-chloral right 
down the main line ought to 
bring him around. 

T)IERSEN opened his eyes and 
started to get out of bed. 
Then he realized that he wasn’t 
in bed. 

He was lying in tall grass, with 
a glaring white sky overhead and 
the odor of decaying vegetation 
in his nostrils. 

He groaned and closed his eyes 
again. This was too much. He 
must have been really boiled last 
night, potted, fried, roasted and 
done to a turn. Hadn’t even made 
it home. Apparently he had 
passed out in Central Park. Now 
he’d have to hail a flit and hold 
himself together until he could 
reach his apartment. 

With a mighty effort, he 
opened his eyes and stood up. 

He was standing in tall grass. 
Surrounding him, as far as he 
could see, were giant orange- 
boled trees. The trees were in- 
terlaced with purple and green 
vines, some as thick as his body. 

10 



Around the trees, impenetrably 
dense, was a riotous jungle of 
ferns, shrubs, evil yellow orchids, 
black creepers, and many un- 
identifiable plants of ominous 
shape and hue. Through this 
dense jungle, he could hear the 
chitter and squeak of small ani- 
mals and a distant grating roar 
from some larger beast. 

“This is not Central Park,” 
Piersen informed himself. 

He looked around, shielding 
his eyes from the glaring sun- 
less sky. 

“I don’t even think it’s Earth,” 
he said. 

He was astonished and de- 
lighted with his calmness. Grave- 
ly, he sat down in the tall grass 
and proceeded to review his situ- 
ation. 

His name was Walter Hill 
Piersen. He was 32 years old, a 
resident of New York City. He 
was a fully accredited voter, re- 
spectably unemployed, moderate- 
ly well off. Last night, he had left 
his apartment at seven-fifteen, 
with the intention of partying. It 
must have been quite an evening. 

Yes, quite an evening, Pier- 
sen told himself. At some time 
during it, he seemed to have 
blacked out. But instead of com- 
ing to in bed, or even in Central 
Park, he had awakened in a thick 
and smelly jungle. Furthermore, 
he felt certain that this jungle 
was not on Earth. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



That summed it up rather well, 
Piersen told himself. He looked 
around at the vast orange trees, 
the purple and green vines which 
interwove them, the harsh white 
sunlight streaming through. And, 
finally, the reality of it all filtered 
through his befogged mind. 

He shrieked in terror, buried 
his head in his arms and passed 
out. 

r | ’HE next time he recovered 
•i- consciousness, most of his 
hangover had gone, leaving be- 
hind only a, taste in his mouth 
and a general state of debility. 
Then and there, Piersen decided 
it was time he went on the wagon 
- past time, when he started hav- 
ing hallucinations about orange- 
colored trees and purple vines 
in an alien jungle. 

Cold sober now, he opened his 
eyes and saw that he was in an 
alien jungle. 

“All right!” he shouted. “What’s 
this all about?” 

There was no immediate an- 
swer. Then, from the surround- 
ing trees, a vast chattering of un- 
seen animal life began, and slow- 
ly subsided. 

Shakily, Piersen stood up and 
leaned against a tree. He had 
reacted all he could to the situa- 
tion; there was no more aston- 
ishment left in him. So he was 
in a jungle. All right— then what 
was he doing there? 



No answer sprang to mind. Ob- 
viously, he told himself, some- 
thing unusual must have hap- 
pened last night. But what? Pain- 
fully, he tried to reconstruct the 
events of the evening. 

He had left his apartment at 
seven-fifteen and gone to . 

He whirled. Something was 
coming toward him, moving soft- 
ly through the underbrush. Pier- 
sen waited, his heart hammering. 
It came nearer, moving cautious- 
ly, sniffing and moaning faintly. 
Then the underbrush parted and 
the creature came out into the 
open. 

It was about ten feet long, a 
streamlined blue-black animal 
shaped like a torpedo or a shark, 
moving toward him on four sets 
of thick, stubby legs. It seemed 
to have no external eyes or ears, 
but long antennae vibrated from 
its sloping forehead. When it 
opened its long, undershot jaw, 
Piersen saw rows of yellow teeth. 

Moaning softly to itself, the 
creature advanced upon him. 

Although he had never seen 
nor dreamed of a beast like this, 
Piersen didn’t pause to question 
its validity. He turned and 
sprinted into the jungle. For fif- 
teen minutes, he raced through 
the underbrush. Then, complete- 
ly winded, he was forced to stop. 

Far behind him, he could hear 
the blue-black creature moaning 
as it followed. 



MORNING AFTER 



11 



Piersen started again, walking 
now. Judging by the creature’s 
moans, it couldn’t move very 
rapidly. He was able to main- 
tain his distance at a walk. But 
what would happen when he 
stopped? What were its inten- 
tions toward him? And could it 
climb trees? 

He decided not to think about 
it at present. 

The first question, the key to 
all other questions, was: What 
was he doing here? What hap- 
pened to him last night? 

He concentrated. 

TTE had left his apartment at 
seven-fifteen and gone for a 
walk. The New York climatolo- 
gist had, by popular demand, pro- 
duced a pleasant misty evening 
with a fertile hint of rain, which, 
of course, would never fall on the 
city proper. It made for pleasant 
walking. 

He strolled down Fifth 
Avenue, window shopping, and 
making note of the Free Days 
offered by the stores. Baimler’s 
Department Store, he noticed, 
was having a Free Day next 
Wednesday, from six to nine a.m. 
He really should get a special 
pass from his alderman. Even 
with it, he would have to wake 
up early and stand in the pref- 
erential line. But it was better 
than paying. 

In half an hour, he was com- 



fortably hungry. There were 
several good commercial restau- 
rants nearby, but he seemed to 
be without funds. So he turned 
down 54th Street, to the Coutray 
Free Restaurant. 

At the door, he showed his 
voting card and his special pass, 
signed by Coutray’s third assist- 
ant secretary, and was allowed 
in. He ordered a plain filet 
mignon dinner and drank a mild 
red wine with it, since no stronger 
beverages were served there. His 
waiter brought him the evening 
newspaper. Piersen scanned the 
listings for free entertainment, 
but found nothing to his liking. 

As he was leaving, the manager 
of the restaurant hurried up to 
him. 

“Beg pardon, sir,” the manager 
said. “Was everything satisfac- 
tory, sir?” 

“The service was slow,” said 
Piersen. “The filet, although 
edible, was not of truly prime 
quality. The wine was passable.” 

“Yes, sir— thank you, sir— our 
apologies, sir,” the manager said, 
jotting down Piersen’s comments 
in a little notebook. “We’ll try 
to improve, sir. Your dinner came 
to you courtesy of the Honorable 
Blake Coutray, Water Commis- 
sioner for New York. Mr. 
Coutray is standing for re-elec- 
tion on November 22. Row J-3 
in your voting booth. We humbly 
solicit your vote, sir.”

“We’ll see,” said Piersen, and 
left the restaurant. 

In the street, he helped him- 
self to a souvenir pack of ciga- 
rettes which a record-playing dis- 
pensing machine was distributing 
for Elmer Baine, a minor Brook- 
lyn politician. He strolled again 
along Fifth Avenue, thinking 
about Blake Coutray. 

T IKE any accredited citizen, 
Piersen valued his vote high- 
ly and bestowed it only after 
mature consideration. He, like 
all voters, considered a candi- 
date’s qualifications carefully be- 
fore voting for or against him. 

In Coutray’s favor was the 
fact that he had maintained a 
good restaurant for nearly a year. 
But what else had he done? 
Where was that free amusement 
center he had promised, and the 
jazz concerts? 

Shortage of .public funds was 
not a valid excuse. 

Would a new man do more? 
Or should Coutray be given an- 
other term? These were not ques- 
tions to be decided out of hand, 
Piersen thought. And now was 
not the time for serious think- 
ing. Nights were made for pleas- 
ure, intoxication, laughter. 

What should he do this even- 
ing? He had seen most of the 
free shows. Sporting events didn’t 
interest him particularly. There 
were several parties going, but 



they didn’t sound very amusing v 
He could find available girls at 
the Mayor’s Open House, but 
Piersen’s appetites had been wan- 
ing of late. 

So he could get drunk, which 
was the surest escape from an 
evening’s boredom. What would 
it be? Miniscarette? A contact 
intoxicant? Skliti? 

“Hey, Walt!” 

He turned. Billie Benz was 
walking toward him, grinning 
broadly, half roasted already. 

“Hey, there, Walt boy!” Benz 
said. “You got anything on to- 
night?” 

“Nothing much,” Piersen asked. 
“Why?” 

“A new kick’s opening. Fine, 
brilliant, lively new kick. Care 
to try?” 

Piersen frowned. He didn’t like 
Benz. The big, loud, red-faced 
man was a thoroughgoing shirker, 
a completely worthless human. 
The fact that he held no job 
didn’t bother Piersen. Hardly 
anyone worked any more. Why 
work if you can vote? But Benz 
was too lazy even to vote. And 
that, Piersen felt, was too much. 
Voting was the obligation and 
livelihood of every citizen. 

Still, Benz had an uncanny 
knack for finding new kicks be- 
fore anyone else. 

Piersen hesitated, then asked, 
“Is it free?” 

“Freer than soup,” Benz said,

unoriginal as always. 

“What’s it all about?” 

“Well, friend, come along and 
let me tell you . 

OIERSEN mopped perspira- 
*- tion from his face. The 
jungle had become deathly still. 
He could no longer hear the blue- 
black animal moaning in the 
underbrush behind him. Perhaps 
it had given up the chase. 

His evening clothes were 
ripped to shreds. Piersen stripped 
off the jacket and unbuttoned his 
shirt to the waist. The sun, hid- 
den somewhere behind the dead- 
white sky, glared down. He was 
drenched in perspiration and his 
throat was parched. He would 
have to have water soon. 

His situation was becoming 
perilous. But Piersen refused to 
think about it now. He had to 
know why he was here before he 
could plan a way out. 

What fine, brilliant new kick 
had he gone to with Billie Benz? 

He leaned against a tree and 
shut his eyes. Slowly the memory 
began to form in his mind. They 
had walked east on 62nd Street 
and then— 

He heard the underbrush 
tremble and looked up quickly. 
The blue-black creature crept 
silently out. Its long antennae 
quivered, then homed on him. In- 
stantly the creature gathered 
itself and sprang. 

14 



Reacting instinctively, Piersen 
jumped out of the way. The 
creature, claws extended, missed 
him, whirled and leaped again. 
Off balance, Piersen couldn’t 
dodge in time. He threw out 
both arms and the shark-shaped 
animal crashed into him. 

The impact slammed Piersen 
against a tree. Desperately, he 
clung to the beast’s broad throat, 
straining to keep the snapping 
jaws from his face. He tightened 
his grip, trying to choke it, but 
there wasn’t enough strength in 
his fingers. 

The creature twisted and 
writhed, its paws clawing up the 
ground. Piersen’s arms began to 
bend under the strain. The snap- 
ping jaws came within an inch 
of his face. A long black-specked 
tongue licked out— 

In sheer revulsion, Piersen 
hurled the moaning creature from 
him. Before it could recover, he 
seized two vines and pulled him- 
self into a tree. Driven by sheer 
panic, he scrambled up the slip- 
pery trunk from branch to 
branch. Thirty feet above the 
ground, he looked down. 

The blue-black thing was com- 
ing up after him, climbing as 
though trees were its natural 
habitat. 

Piersen went on, his whole 
body beginning to shake from the 
strain. The trunk was thinning 
out now and there were only a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



few branches left to which he 
could cling. As he approached the 
top, fifty feet above the ground, 
the whole tree began to sway 
beneath his weight. 

He looked down and saw the 
creature ten feet below him and 
still coming. Piersen groaned, 
afraid he could climb no further. 
But fright put strength into his 
body. He scrambled to the last 
large branch, took a firm grip 
and drew back both legs. As the 
beast approached, he lashed out 
with both feet. 

He caught it full in the body. 
Its claws tore out of the bark 
with a loud rasping sound. The 
creature fell, screaming, crash- 
ing through the overhanging 
branches, and finally hitting the 
ground with a squashy thud. 

Then there was silence. 

The creature was probably 
dead, Piersen thought. But he 
was not going down to investi- 
gate. No power on Earth— or any 
other planet in the Galaxy— 
would induce him to descend wil- 
lingly from his tree. He was go- 
ing to stay right where he was 
until he was damned good and 
ready to come down. 

He slid down a few feet until 
he came to a large forked branch. 
Here he was able to make a se- 
cure perch for himself. When 
he was settled, he realized how 
close to collapse he was. Last 
night’s binge had drained him; 



today’s exertions had squeezed 
him dry. 

If anything larger than a squir- 
rel attacked him now, he was 
finished. 

He settled his leaden limbs 
against the tree, closed his eyes 
and went on with his reconstruc- 
tion of last night’s events. 

66WTELL, friend,” Billie Benz 
’ ' had said, “come along and 
let me tell' you. Better still, let 
me show you.” 

They walked east on 52nd 
Street, while the deep blue twi- 
light darkened into night. Man- 
hattan’s lights came on, stars ap- 
peared on the horizon, and a cres- 
cent moon glowed through thin 
haze. 

“Where are we going?” Pier- 
sen asked. 

“Right hyar, podner,” Benz 
said. 

They were in front of a small 
brownstone building. A discreet 
brass sign on the door read NAR- 
COLICS. 

“New free drug parlor,” said 
Benz. “It was opened just this 
evening by Thomas Moriarty, 
the Reform Candidate for 
Mayor. No one’s heard about it 
yet.” 

“Fine!” Piersen said. 

There were plenty of free ac- 
tivities in the city. The only prob- 
lem was getting to them before 
the crowds collected, because al- 



MORNING AFTER 



15 



most everyone was in search of 
pleasure and change. 

Many years back, the Central 
Eugenics Committee of the Unit- 
ed World Government had stabi- 
lized the world population at a 
sensible figure. Not in a thousand 
years had there been so few peo- 
ple on Earth and never had they 
been so well cared for. Under- 
sea ecology, hydroponics and full 
utilization of the surface lands 
made food and clothing abun- 
dantly available — overavailable, 
in fact. Lodgings for a small, 
stable population was no prob- 
lem, with automatic building 
methods and a surplus of ma- 
terials. Even luxury goods were 
no luxury. 

It was a safe, stable, static cul- 
ture. Those few who researched, 
produced and kept the machines 
running received generous com- 
pensation. But most people just 
didn’t bother working. There 
was no need and no incentive. 

There were some ambitious 
men, of course, driven to acquire 
wealth, position, power. They 
went into politics. They solicited 
votes by feeding, clothing and 
entertaining the populace of their 
districts, out of abundant public 
funds. And they cursed the fickle 
voters for switching to more im- 
pressive promise-makers. 

It was a utopia of sorts. Pov- 
erty was forgotten, wars were 
long gone and everyone had the 

16 



guarantee of a long, easy life. 

It must have been sheer hu- 
man ingratitude that made the 
suicide rate so shockingly high. 

DENZ showed his passes to 
the door, which opened at 
once. They walked down a cor- 
ridor to a large, comfortably fur- 
nished living room. Three men 
and one woman, early birds who 
had heard of the new opening, 
were slumped comfortably on 
couches, smoking pale green 
cigarettes. There was a pleasant- 
ly unpleasant pungent odor in the 
air. 

An attendant came forward 
and led them to a vacant divan. 
“Make yourselves right at home, 
gentlemen,” he said. “Light up a 
narcolic and let your troubles 
drift away.” 

He handed them each a pack 
of pale green cigarettes. 

“What’s in this stuff?” Piersen 
asked. 

“Narcolic cigarettes,” the at- 
tendant told them, “are a choice 
mixture of Turkish and Virginian 
tobaccos, with a carefully meas- 
ured amount of narcola, an in- 
toxicant plant which grows in 
Venus’s eauatorial belt.” 

“Venus?” Benz asked. “I didn’t 
know we’d reached Venus.” 

“Four years ago, sir,” the at- 
tendant said. “The Yale Expedi- 
tion made the first landing and 
set up a base.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



‘I think I read something 
about that,” said Piersen. “Or saw 
it in a newsreel. Venus. Crude, 
jungly sort of place, isn’t it?” 

“Quite crude,” the attendant 
said. 

“I thought so,” said Piersen. 
“Hard to keep up with every- 
thing. Is this narcola habit-form- 
ing?” 

“Not at all, sir,” the attendant 
reassured him. “Narcola has the 
effect alcohol should have, but 
rarely does— great lift, sensations 
of well-being, slow taper, no 
hangover. It comes to you cour- 
tesy of Thomas Moriarty, the 
Reform Candidate for Mayor. 
Row A-2 in your voting booths, 
gentlemen. We humbly solicit 
your votes.” 

Both men nodded and lighted 
up. 

Piersen began to feel the ef- 
fects almost at once. His first 
cigarette left him relaxed, dis- 
embodied, with a strong premo- 
nition of pleasure to come. His 
second enhanced these effects 
and produced others. His senses 
were marvelously sharpened. The 
world seemed a delightful place, 
a place of hope and wonder. And 
he himself became a vital and 
necessary part of it. 

Benz nudged him in the ribs. 
“Pretty good, huh?” 

“Damned fine,” said Piersen. 
“This Moriarty must be a good 
man. World needs good men.” 



“Right,” agreed Benz. “Needs 
smart men.” 

“Courageous, bold, far-sighted 
men,” Piersen went on emphati- 
cally. “Men like us, buddy, to 
mold the future and — ” He 
stopped abruptly. 

“Whatsa matter?” Benz asked. 

Piersen didn’t answer. By a 
fluke known to all drunkards, the 
narcotic had suddenly reversed 
its effect. He had been feeling 
godlike. Now, with an inebriate’s 
clarity, he saw himself as he was. 

He was Walter Hill Piersen, 
32, unmarried, unemployed, un- 
wanted. He had taken a job when 
he was eighteen, to please his 
parents. But he had given it up 
after a week, because it bored 
him and interfered with his sleep. 
He had considered marriage 
once, but the responsibilities of 
a wife and family appalled him. 
He was almost thirty-three, thin, 
flabby-muscled and pallid. He 
had never done anything of the 
slightest importance to himself or 
to anyone else, and he never 
would. 

“Tell your buddy all about it, 
buddy,” Benz said. 

“Wanna do great things,” Pier- 
sen mumbled, dragging on the 
cigarette. 

“You do, pal?” 

“Damn right! Wanna be ad- 
venturer!” 

“Why didn’t you say so? I’ll fix 
it up for you!” Benz jumped up 



MORNING AFTER

and tugged at Piersen’s arm. 
“Come on!” 

“You’ll what?” Piersen tried 
to push Benz away. He just 
wanted to sit and feel terrible. 
But Benz yanked him to his feet. 

“I know what you need, pal,” 
Benz said. “Adventure, excite- 
ment! Well, I know the place 
for it!” 

Piersen frowned thoughtfully, 
swaying on his feet. “Lean close,” 
he said to Benz. “Gotta whisper.” 

Benz leaned over. Piersen 
whispered, “Want adventure— but 
don’t wanna get hurt. Get it?” 

“Got it,” Benz assured him. 
“Know just what you want. Let’s 
go! Adventure lies ahead! Safe 
adventure!” 

Arm in arm, clutching their 
packs of narcolics, they staggered 
out of the Reform Candidate’s 
drug parlor. 

A BREEZE had come up, 
swaying the tree in which 
Piersen clung. It blew across his 
hot, damp body, suddenly chill- 
ing him. His teeth began to chat- 
ter and his arms ached from 
gripping the smooth branch. His 
parched throat felt as though it 
were clogged with fine, hot sand. 

The thirst was more than he 
could stand. If necessary, he’d 
face a dozen blue-black creatures 
now for a drink of water. 

Slowly he started down the 
tree, shelving his dim memories 



of last night. He had to know 
what happened, but first he 
needed water. 

At the base of the tree, he saw 
the blue-black creature, its back 
broken, sprawled motionless 
upon the ground. He passed it 
and pushed into the jungle. 

He trudged forward, for hours 
or days, losing all track of time 
under the glaring, unchanging 
white sky. The brush tore at his 
clothing and birds screamed 
warning signals as he plunged on. 
He ignored everything, glassy- 
eyed and rubber-legged. He fell, 
picked himself up and went on, 
fell again, and again. Like a ro- 
bot, he continued until he stum- 
bled upon a thin, muddy brown 
stream. 

With no thought to the dan- 
gerous bacteria it might contain, 
Piersen sprawled on his face and 
drank. 

After a while, he rested and 
surveyed his surroundings. Close 
around him were the walls of 
the jungle— bright, dense, alien. 
The sky above was glaring white, 
no lighter or darker than be- 
fore. And small, unseen life 
chirped and squeaked in the un- 
derbrush. 

This was a very lonely place, 
Piersen decided, and a very dan- 
gerous one. He wanted out. 

But which way was out? Were 
there any cities here, any peo- 
ple? And if so, how would he 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ever find them in this direction- 
less wasteland? 

And what was he doing here? 

He rubbed his unshaven jaw 
and tried to remember. Last 
night seemed a million years ago 
and a totally different life. New 
York was like a city in a dream. 
For him, the only truth was this 
jungle, and the hunger gnawing 
at his belly, and the strange hum- 
ming that had just begun. 

He looked around, trying to 
locate the source of the sound. 
It seemed to come from all sides, 
from nowhere and everywhere. 
Piersen doubled his fists and 
stared until his eyes hurt, try- 
ing to catch sight of the new 
menace. 

Then, close to him, a brilliant 
green shrub moved. Piersen 
leaped away from it, trembling 
violently. The shrub shook all 
over and its thin hooked leaves 
produced a humming sound. 

Then- 

The shrub looked at him. 

It had no eyes. But Piersen 
could feel the shrub become 
aware of him, focus on him, come 
to a decision about him. The 
shrub hummed louder. Its 
branches stretched toward him, 
touched the ground, rooted, sent 
out searching tendrils which 
grew, rooted and sent out new 
tendrils. 

The plant was growing toward 
him, moving at the speed of a 



man walking slowly. 

Piersen stared at the sharp, 
glittering hooked leaves reaching 
toward him. He couldn’t believe 
it, yet he had to believe it. 

And then he remembered the 
rest of what had happened last 
night. 

^CTIYAR we be, podner,” Benz 
said, turning into a bright- 
ly lighted building on Madison 
Avenue. He ushered Piersen into 
the elevator. They rode to the 
twenty-third floor and stepped 
into a large, bright reception 
room. 

A discreet sign on one wall 
read adventures unlimited. 

“I’ve heard about this place,” 
Piersen said, dragging deeply on 
a narcolic cigarette. “It’s sup- 
posed to be expensive.” 

“Don’t worry about that,” Benz 
told him. 

A blonde receptionist took 
their names and led them to the 
private office of Dr. Srinagar 
Jones, Action Consultant. 

“Good evening, gentlemen,” 
said Jones. 

He was slight, thin and wore 
heavy glasses. Piersen found it 
hard to restrain a giggle. This 
was an Action Consultant? 

“So you gentlemen desire ad- 
venture?” Jones inquired pleas- 
antly. 

“He wants adventure,” said 
Benz. “I’m just a friend of his.” 



MORNING AFTER 



19 



“Of course. Now, then, sir,” 
Jones said, turning to Piersen, 
“what kind of adventure did you 
have in mind?” 

“Outdoor adventure,” Piersen 
replied, a trifle thickly, but with 
absolute confidence. 

“We have just the thing,” Jones 
said. “Usually there is a fee. But 
tonight all adventures are free, 
courtesy of President Main. Row 
C-l in your voting booth. Come 
this way, sir.” 

“Hold on. I don’t want to get 
killed, you know. Is this adven- 
ture safe?” 

“Perfectly safe. No other kind 
of adventure would be tolerated 
in this day and age. Here’s how 
it works. You relax comfortably 
on a bed in our Explorer’s Room 
and receive a painless injection. 
This causes immediate loss of 
consciousness. Then, through a 
judicious application of auditory, 
tactile and other stimuli, we pro- 
duce an adventure in your mind.” 

“Like a dream?” Piersen 
asked. 

“That would be the best analo- 
gy. This dream adventure is ab- 
solutely realistic in content. You 
experience actual pain, actual 
emotions. There’s no way you 
can tell it from the real thing. 
Except, of course, that it is a 
dream and therefore perfectly 
safe.” 

“What happens if I’m killed in 
the adventure?” 

20 



“It’s the same as dreaming 
that you’re killed. You wake up, 
that’s all. But while you’re in this 
ultra-realistic, vividly colored 
dream, you have free will and 
conscious power over your dream 
movements.” 

“Do I know all this while I’m 
having the adventure?” 

“Absolutely. While in the 
dream, you have full knowledge 
of its dream status.” 

“Then lead on!” Piersen 
shouted. “On with the dream!” 

r T'HE bright green shrub grew 
slowly toward him. Piersen 
burst into laughter. A dream! Of 
course, it was all a dream! 
Nothing could harm him. The 
menacing shrub was a figment of 
his imagination, like the blue- 
black animal. Even if the beast’s 
jaws had closed on his throat, 
he would not have been killed. 

He would simply have awak- 
ened in the Explorer’s Room of 
Adventures Unlimited. 

It all seemed ridiculous now. 
Why hadn’t he realized all this 
earlier? That blue-black thing 
was obviously a dream creation. 
And the bright green shrub was 
preposterous. It was all rather 
silly and unbelievable, once you 
really thought about it. 

In a loud voice, Piersen said, 
“All right. You can wake me up 
now.” 

Nothing happened. Then he re- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



membered that you couldn’t 
awaken simply by requesting it. 
That would invalidate the sense 
of adventure and destroy the 
therapeutic effects of excitement 
and fear upon a jaded nervous 
system. 

He remembered now. The only 
way you could leave an adven- 
ture was by winning through all 
obstacles. Or by being killed. 

The shrub had almost reached 
his feet. Piersen watched it, mar- 
veling at its realistic appearance. 

It fastened one of its hooked 
leaves into the leather of his shoe. 
Piersen grinned, proud of the way 
he was mastering his fear and re- 
vulsion. He merely had to re- 
member that the thing couldn’t 
hurt him. 

But how, he asked himself, 
could a person have a realistic 
adventure if he knew all the time 
that it wasn’t real? Surely Adven- 
tures Unlimited must have con- 
sidered that. 

Then he remembered the last 
thing Jones told him. 

He had been lying on the 
white cot and Jones was bending 
over him, hypodermic needle 
ready. Piersen had asked, “Look, 
pal, how can I have an adventure 
if I know it’s not real?” 

“That has been taken care of,” 
Jones had said. “You see, sir, 
some of our clients undergo real 
adventures.” 

“Huh?” 



“Real, actual, physical adven- 
tures. One client out of many re- 
ceives the knockout injection, but 
no further stimulus. He is placed 
aboard a spaceship and taken to 
Venus. There he revives and ex- 
periences in fact what the others 
undergo in fantasy. If he wins 
through, he lives.” 

“And if not?” 

Jones had shrugged his shoul- 
ders, waiting patiently, the hypo- 
dermic poised. 

“That’s inhuman!” Piersen had 
cried. 

“We disagree. Consider, Mr. 
Piersen, the need for adventure 
in the world today. Danger is 
necessary, to offset a certain 
weakening of human fiber which 
easy times has brought to the 
race. These fantasy adventures 
present danger in its safest and 
most palatable form. But they 
would lose all value if the person 
undergoing them did not take 
them seriously. The adventurer 
must have the possibility, no mat- 
ter how remote, that he is truly 
engaging in a life and death 
struggle.” 

“But the ones who really go 
to Venus—” 

“An insignificant percentage,” 
Jones reassured him. “Less than 
one in ten thousand. Simply to 
enhance the possibility of dan- 
ger for the others.” 

“But is it legal?” Piersen had 
persisted. 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Quite legal. On a total per- 
centage basis, you run a greater 
risk drinking miniscarette or 
smoking narcolics.” 

“Well,” said Piersen, “I’m not 
sure I want—” 

The hypodermic bit suddenly 
into his arm. 

“Everything will be all right,” 
Jones said soothingly. “Just re- 
lax, Mr. Piersen . .” 

That was his last memory be- 
fore awakening in the jungle. 

DY now, the green shrub had 
* " reached Piersen’s ankle. A 
slender hooked leaf slid, very 
slowly, very gently, into his flesh. 
All he felt was the faintest tick- 
ling sensation. After a moment, 
the leaf turned a dull red. 

A blood-sucking plant, Piersen 
thought with some amusement. 

The whole adventure suddenly 
palled on him. It had been a silly 
drunken idea in the first place. 
Enough was enough. He wanted 
out of this, and immediately. 

The shrub edged closer and 
slid two more hooked leaves into 
Piersen’s leg. The entire plant 
was beginning to turn a muddy 
red-brown. 

Piersen wanted to go back to 
New York, to parties, free food, 
free entertainment and a lot of 
sleep. If he destroyed this 
menace, another would spring up. 
This might go on for days or 
weeks. 



The quickest way home was to 
let the shrub kill him. Then he 
could simply wake up. 

His strength was beginning to 
ebb. He sat down, noticing that 
several more shrubs were grow- 
ing toward him, attracted by the 
scent of blood. 

“It can’t be real,” he said out 
loud. “Who ever heard of a blood- 
sucking plant, even on Venus?” 

High above him were great, 
black-winged birds, soaring pa- 
tiently, waiting for their chance 
at the corpse. 

Could this be real? 

The odds, he reminded him- 
self, were ten thousand to one 
that it was a dream. Only a 
dream. A vivid, realistic dream. 
But a dream, nevertheless. 

Still, suppose it was real? 

He was growing dizzy and 
weak from loss of blood. He 
thought, I want to go home. The 
way home is to die. The chance 
of actual death is so small, so 
infinitesimal . 

The truth burst upon him. In 
this age, no one would dare risk 
the life of a voter. Adventures 
Unlimited couldn’t really put a 
man in jeopardy! 

Jones had told him about that 
one in ten thousand merely to 
add a sense of reality to the fan- 
tasy adventure! 

That had to be the truth. He 
lay back, closed his eyes and pre- 
pared to die. 



MORNING AFTER 



23 



While he was dying, thoughts 
stirred in his mind, old dreams 
and fears and hopes. He remem- 
bered the one job he had held 
and his mingled pleasure and re- 
gret at leaving it. He thought of 
his obtuse, hard-working parents, 
unwilling to accept the rewards 
of civilization without, as they 
put it, earning them. He thought, 
harder than ever before in his 
life, and he came into contact 
with a Piersen whose existence 
he had never suspected. 

nPHE other Piersen was a very 
uncomplicated creature. He 
simply wanted to live. He was de- 
termined to live. This Piersen 
refused to die under any circum- 
stances— even imaginary. 

The two Piersens, one moti- 
vated by pride, the other by de- 
sire for survival, struggled briefly, 
while strength ebbed out of their 
body. Then they resolved the' 
conflict upon mutually satisfac- 
tory terms. 

“That damned Jones thinks 
I’ll die,” Piersen said. “Die in 
order to wake up. Well, I’ll be 
damned if I’ll give him the satis- 
faction!” 

It was the only way he could 
accept his own desire to live. 

Frighteningly weak, he strug- 
gled to his feet and tried to pull 
the bloodsucking plant loose. It 
wouldn’t release its grip. With a 
shout of rage, Piersen reached 

24 



down and wrenched with all his 
strength. The hooks slashed his 
legs as they pulled free, and other 
hooks slid into his right arm. 

But his legs were free now. He 
kicked aside two more plants and 
lurched into the jungle, with the 
green shrub growing up his arm. 

Piersen stumbled along until 
he was far from the other plants. 
Then he tried to yank the last 
shrub from his arm. 

The shrub caught both his 
arms, imprisoning them. Sobbing 
with anger and pain, Piersen 
swung his arms high and 
slammed them against the trunk 
of a tree. 

The hooks loosened. Again he 
slammed his arms against the 
tree, shutting his eyes to the pain. 
Again and again, until the shrub 
released. 

Instantly, Piersen began stag- 
gering on again. 

But he had delayed his life- 
struggle too long. He was stream- 
ing blood from a hundred slashes 
and the scent was like an alarm 
bell through the jungle. Over- 
head, something swift and black 
descended. Piersen threw him- 
self down and the shape passed 
over him with a flurry of beating 
wings, shrilling angrily. 

He rolled to his feet and tried 
to find protection in a thorny 
bush. A great, black-winged bird 
with a crimson breast dived 
again. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



This time, sharp claws caught 
him in the shoulder and flung 
him down. The bird landed on 
his chest with a wild beating 
of wings. It pecked at his eyes, 
missed, pecked again. 

Piersen lashed out. His fist 
caught the bird full in the throat, 
knocking it over. 

He scrambled into the thorn 
bush on all fours. The bird cir- 
cled, shrilling, trying to find a 
way in. Piersen moved deeper 
into the thicket toward safety. 

Then he heard a low moan be- 
side him. 

He had waited too long. The 
jungle had marked him for death 
and would never let him go. Be- 
side him was a long, blue-black, 
shark-shaped creature, slightly 
smaller than the first he had en- 
countered, creeping quickly and 
easily toward him through the 
thorn thicket. 

Caught between a shrieking 
death in the air and a moaning 
death on the ground, Piersen 
came to his feet. He shouted his 
fear, anger and defiance. And 
without hesitation, he flung him- 
self at the blue-black beast. 

The great jaws slashed. Pier- 
sen lay motionless. With his last 
vestige of consciousness, he saw 
the jaws widen for the death- 
stroke. 

Can it be real, Piersen won- 
dered, in sudden fear, just before 
he blanked out. 



TV7HEN he recovered con- 

” sciousness, he was lying on 
a white cot, in a white, softly 
lighted room. Slowly his head 
cleared and he remembered— his 
death. 

Quite an adventure, he 
thought. Must tell the boys. But 
first a drink. Maybe ten drinks 
and a little entertainment. 

He turned his head. A girl in 
white, who had been sitting in a 
chair beside his bed, rose and 
bent over him. 

“How do you feel, Mr. Pier- 
sen?” she asked. 

“Fair,” Piersen said. “Where’s 
Jones?” 

“Jones?” 

“Srinagar Jones. He runs this 
place.” 

“You must be mistaken, sir,” 
the girl told him. “Dr. Baintree 
runs our colony.” 

“Your what?” Piersen shouted. 

A man came into the room. 
“That will be all, Nurse,” he said. 
He turned to Piersen. “Welcome 
to Venus, Mr. Piersen. I’m Dr. 
Baintree, Director of Camp Five.” 

Piersen stared unbelievingly at 
the tall, bearded man. He strug- 
gled out of bed and would have 
fallen if Baintree hadn’t steadied 
him. 

He was amazed to find most 
of his body wrapped in bandages. 

“It was real?” he asked. 

Baintree helped him to the 
window. Piersen looked out on 



MORNING AFTER 



25 



cleared land, fences and the dis- 
tant green edge of the jungle. 

“One out of ten thousand!” 
Piersen said bitterly. “Of all the 
damned luck! I could have been 
killed!” 

“You nearly were,” said Bain- 
tree. “But your coming here 
wasn’t a matter of luck or satis- 
fies.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Mr. Piersen, let me put it 
this way. Life is easy on Earth. 
The problems of human exist- 
ence have been solved — but 
solved, I fear, to the detriment of 
the race. Earth stagnates. The 
birth rate continues to fall, the 
suicide rate goes up. New fron- 



tiers are opening in space, but 
hardly anyone is interested in 
going to them. Still, the frontiers 
must be manned, if the race is to 
survive.” 

“I have heard that exact 
speech,” Piersen said, “in the 
newsreels, on the solido, in the 
papers—” 

“It didn’t seem to impress 
you.” 

“I don’t believe it.” 

“It’s true,” Baintree assured 
him, “whether you believe it or 
not.” 

WV" OU’RE a fanatic,” Piersen 
said. “I’m not going to 
argue with you. Suppose it is 




26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



true— where do I fit in?” 

“We are desperately under- 
manned,” said Baintree. “We’ve 
offered every inducement, tried 
every possible method of recruit- 
ment. But no one wants to leave 
Earth.” 

“Naturally. So?” 

“This is the only method that 
works. Adventures Unlimited is 
run by us. Likely candidates are 
transported here and left in the 
jungle. We watch to see how they 
make out. It provides an excel- 
lent testing ground— for the indi- 
vidual as well as for us.” 

“What would have happened,” 
Piersen asked, “if I hadn’t fought 
back against the shrubs?” 




Baintree shrugged his shoul- 
ders. 

“And so you recruited me,” 
Piersen said. “You ran me 
through your obstacle course, and 
I fought like a good little man, 
and you saved me just in the 
nick of time. Now I’m supposed 
to be flattered that you picked 
me, huh? Now I’m supposed to 
suddenly realize I’m a rough, 
tough outdoor man? Now I’m 
supposed to be filled with a 
courageous far-sighted pioneer- 
ing spirit?” 

Baintree watched him steadily. 

“And now I’m supposed to 
sign up as a pioneer? Baintree, 
you must think I’m nuts or some-

thing. Do you honestly think I’m 
going to give up a very pleasant 
existence on Earth so I can grub 
around on a farm or hack 
through a jungle on Venus? To 
hell with you, Baintree, and to 
hell with your whole salvation 
program.” 

“I quite understand how you 
feel,” Baintree answered. “Our 
methods are somewhat arbitrary, 
but the situation requires it. 
When you’ve calmed down—” 
“I’m perfectly calm now!” Pier- 
sen screamed. “Don’t give me any 
more sermons about saving the 
world! I want to go home to a 
nice comfortable pleasure pal- 
ace.” 

“You can leave on this even- 
ing’s flight,” Baintree said. 
“What? Just like that?” 

“Just like that.” 

“I don’t get it,” said Piersen. 
“Are you trying psychology on 
me? It won’t work — I’m going 
home. I don’t see why any of 
your kidnap victims stay here.” 
“They don’t,” Baintree said. 
“What?” 

“Occasionally, one decides to 
stay. But for the most part, they 
react like you. They do not dis- 
cover a sudden deep love for 
the soil, an overwhelming urge 
to conquer a new planet. That’s 
storybook stuff. They want to 
go home. But they often agree to 
help us on Earth.” 

“How?” 



“By becoming recruiters,” 
Baintree said. “It’s fun, really. 
You eat and drink and enjoy 
yourself, the same as ever. And 
when you find a likely looking 
candidate, you talk him into tak- 
ing a dream adventure with Ad- 
ventures Unlimited — exactly as 
Benz did with you.” 

"piERSEN looked startled. 

“Benz? That worthless bum 
is a recruiter?” 

“Certainly. Did you think re- 
cruiters were starry-eyed ideal- 
ists? They’re people like you, 
Piersen, who enjoy having a good 
time, enjoy being on the inside 
of things, and perhaps even en- 
joy doing some good for the hu- 
man race, as long as it’s no 
trouble to them. I think you’d 
like the work.” 

“I might try it for a while,” 
Piersen said. “For a kick.” 

“That’s all we ask,” said Bain- 
tree. 

“But how do you get new 
colonists?” 

“Well, that’s a funny thing. 
After a few years, many of our 
recruiters get curious about 
what’s happening here. And they 
return.” 

“Well,” Piersen said, “I’ll try 
this recruiting kick for a while. 
But only for a while, as long as 
I feel like it.” 

“Of course,” said Baintree. 
“Come, you’d better get packed.”

“And don’t count on me com- 
ing back. I’m a city boy. I like 
my comfort. The salvation racket 
is strictly for the eager types.” 

“Of course. By the way, you 
did very well in the jungle.” 

“I did?” 

Baintree nodded gravely. 
Piersen stayed at the window, 
staring at the fields, the build- 
ings, the fences and the distant 



edge of the jungle which he had 
fought and nearly overcome. 

“We’d better leave,” said Bain- 
tree. 

“Eh? All right, I’m coming,” 
Piersen said. 

He turned slowly from the 
window with a faint trace of ir- 
ritation that he tried to and couldn’t 
identify.

FORECAST 

NEXT MONTH brings back Isaac Asimov, very much alive 
and kicking up a legal hurricane in Galley Slave , a stormy 
novelet that also returns one of the most famous fiction charac- 
ters to literary life. A fictive resurrection indeed— but a lethal 
one. For the Three Laws of Positronic Robots make it impossible 
to kill a human, but there is a loophole . murdering a man 
after his death! 

Clifford D. Simak also drops in for a visit, bringing a hand- 
some present, a novelet called Carbon Copy. Being a scrupulous 
real estate agent and a devout angler, Homer Jackson knows a 
clean sale from a fish story— but this is one time he gets really 
hooked! The fact that his catcher wears shoes on the wrong feet 
is upsetting enough; from that point on, though, things add up to 
more and more money and less and less sense! 

Along with probably another novelet and short stories and 
our regular features, Willy Ley takes us downstairs for an eye- 
popping inspection of The Spaceship in the Basement! Sounds 
to you like the gag about the man who built a boat in the cellar 
and then couldn't get it out? All right, smile now— you won't 
when you discover that the basement spaceship exists at this 
very moment, who built it and why— and that getting it out of 
the basement is the least of all the problems it has to face! 



MORNING AFTER

YOU 

WERE RIGHT, 
JOE 

By j. t. McIntosh 



You had it taped all the way, 
pal— but how come you didn't 
say this would happen to me? 



Illustrated by DICK 



I CAN’T be sure you’re getting 
this, Joe, but you’ve been 
right about so many of the 
other things, I guess you’re very 
likely right about that, too. 

You remember you figured that 
I wouldn’t just materialize naked 
in the middle of a city street. You 
said I’d be a genuine human be- 
ing of the time, correctly dressed 
and with some kind of personal 
history. But you warned me — 



FRANCIS 



and I appreciate this, Joe; you 
didn’t have to warn me, but you 
did it — you warned me that 
there was no telling I’d be like 
me. 

I may as well admit now I 
wasn’t happy about that. I never 
was much to look at and there 
wasn’t any danger of my becom- 
ing the heavyweight champion 
of the world. But I’d got used to 
being the way I was, and I didn’t 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



altogether like the idea of seeing 
a stranger’s face every time I 
looked in the mirror. 

If I’d known what I was going 
to be like, I’d never have done 
it. I’m sorry, Joe, but even for 
you I couldn’t have faced it. Now 
that I’m here, though, I’ll just 
have to make the best of it. 

You were right, Joe, all along 
the line. Nobody ran screaming 
when I got here and I haven’t 
been arrested. I was fitted into a 
spot that was made for me, 
dressed in the right clothes, able 
to speak the right language. I’ve 
got a name. And just as you said, 
I’m different. Different? That’s 
like saying Gina Lollobrigida isn’t 
like Aunt Phoebe! 

When I first got here, I looked 
around, of course. I saw people 
walking about and colored build- 
ings with hardly any straight 
lines in them. It took no more 
than a glance to show me this 
was a pretty advanced civiliza- 
tion, many centuries ahead of 
our time. 

Before I did any more looking 
around, I did the second obvious 
thing. I looked down at what I 
could see of me. 

I nearly jumped out of my 
skin, Joe. You know those ads: 
You, too, can have a body like 
mine? Well, that was me — 
golden tan, rippling muscles, 
chest a mile wide. Yeah, me Tar- 
zan. I wore very short, tight 

YOU WERE RIGHT, JOE 



trunks and shoes, that was all, 
and believe me, I was scared 
stiff of myself. 

W ELL, you warned me, Joe. 

Funny, I was prepared to 
find myself very young. I even 
took the risk of finding myself 
very old. But I never saw myself 
as Superman. I can’t seem to get 
used to the idea at all. 

It wasn’t that everybody around 
here was like this. Far from it. 
They all seemed young and fit 
and good-looking, but not big 
and not strong. I could see right 
away by the attention I got that 
I was something special. 

And it scared the life out of 
me. Some people wouldn’t mind 
finding themselves looking like a 
Greek god. Me, I’m not the type. 
I’ve spent my life not being no- 
ticed — you know that, Joe — 
and I wasn’t cut out to be a 
symbol of manhood. I don’t think 
I’ll ever get used to it. 

Anyway, Joe, apart from this, 
everything seems to be all right. 
And I’d like to say right away 
that I think it’s safe for you to 
come along, too, if you want to. 
You never said you were sending 
me as a guinea pig, to see whether 
it was safe to go yourself, but 
I’m not completely dumb. I was 
ready to take the gamble just 
the same. 

If you come, you’ll probably 
also find yourself a gorgeous hunk 

31 



of man. You’ll be able to figure 
it out better than me, but I guess 
maybe it’s because the world we 
live in makes us tougher than 
the people living in this world 
have to be. When we show up 
here, we come out a lot bigger 
and stronger than we ever 
dreamed we were. 

Well, maybe you won’t mind 
being Superman, Joe. Come to 
think of it, I guess it’ll suit you 
fine. 

It’s difficult to explain what I 
know and don’t know about this 
world. My name’s Elan Rock, by 
the way. I know that. I know the 
language, and though I haven’t 
used it yet, I’m sure that when I 
do it’ll come out just right. I 
know how to open doors and 
operate what they use instead of 
phones here and what to say in- 
stead of “Good morning” and 
how to do what they call read- 
ing and where I can get their idea 
of a drink. 

I know everything like that. 
But what kind of society this is 
and how it’s governed and what 
year it is and why there are no 
square buildings and why every- 
body walks instead of using cars, 
I don’t know. 

Now I’ll have to break off for 
a while, Joe. When I’m used to 
this, I’ll be able to talk to you 
no matter what I’m doing. Mean- 
time, I don’t want to make any 
big mistakes in my first few 

32 



minutes here in the future. 

I’ll call you again soon. 

T KNOW a lot more now, Joe. 

I’ve seen myself in a mirror 
and it’s just as I thought, only 
worse. I’ve got the face of Apollo 
to go with the figure of Charles 
Atlas. I’d tell you more about 
how I look, but you wouldn’t 
believe it. 

The way I figure it, I couldn’t 
just jump into the future and be 
somebody who’d never existed 
before. Elan Rock had to half- 
exist for twenty-five years so that 
I could come shooting up from 
the Dark Ages and be him. 

I think you said something 
like that once, Joe, only I couldn’t 
digest all you were telling me in 
such a short time before I got 
started. 

You were right, too, about my 
reaching a place which was just 
within my limit of comprehen- 
sion, a place just short of an 
environment that would make me 
go crazy. 

And yet it’s a lot simpler than 
ours. I know the whole code of 
laws, for example. I happened to 
see them a few minutes ago, over 
the door of what passes here for 
a Department of Justice. Trans- 
lated, they go something like this: 

You mustn’t annoy other peo- 
ple. And it you’re other people, 
you mustn’t allow yourself to be 
annoyed too easily. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




YOU WERE RIGHT, JOE 



33 



That’s all there is to it. That 
code is taken to cover murder 
and stealing and other things 
like that which most people 
would agree are crimes. You can 
kill yourself if you like — that’s 
no crime. The only sex crimes 
are acts that would break one 
of these two laws. And notice 
that it’s a crime to be annoyed 
too easily. 

You know, I got a respect for 
these people when I realized 
these were the only laws they 
needed. It wouldn’t be any good 
trying to run out society under 
a pair of laws like that. Herb 
Jones would prove in court that 
he was annoyed by long under- 
wear hanging out in Homer 
Smith’s back yard. And a smart 
lawyer would prove that Herb 
Jones hadn’t been too easily an- 
noyed. So, according to the law, 
Herb Jones would get heavy 
damages. 

You can give people a tre- 
mendous amount of freedom if 
you know they won’t abuse it. 
That’s how things must be here. 

I was just beginning to get 
used to the idea of being Apollo 
when I hit snag number two. 

I’m trying to suspend judgment 
about this, Joe. Naturally, morals 
differ in different societies. All 
the same, it gave me my second 
shock when a little dark girl, 
pretty as anything, took my hand 
and — well, gave me to under- 
34 



stand that she expected me to 
go up to her apartment and make 
love to her. 

I smiled and shook my head, 
and she was obviously surprised 
and hurt, but what could I do? 
It’s bad enough suddenly becom- 
ing a beefcake king without being 
in a place where sex is so free 
and open that — hell, you remem- 
ber how I used to get all red and 
stutter when I had to talk to a 
girl! 

It was only after the little 
brunette had gone on, her lovely 
straight back a living exclamation 
point, that I realized I could 
have politely thanked her and 
explained that I kept getting such 
propositions and a man can 
spread himself only so far and — 
you know what I mean. 

I’ll try that next time. I’m 
uneasily convinced that there’s 
going to be a next time, maybe in 
five minutes. When it happens, 
I’ll . 

S ORRY I broke off like that, 
Joe. 

Before we go any further, we’d 
better have an understanding 
about the power over me that 
you say you have. You told me 
that if you didn’t hear from me, 
if I held out on you, you could 
do something and I’d die. Frankly, 
I don’t believe it, Joe. I think you 
said that just to keep me in line. 

I don’t think you can do any- 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thing to me now any more than 
you can talk to me. You ex- 
plained why I could communicate 
with you and why you couldn’t 
communicate with me. I didn’t 
understand what you said, but 
you were very convincing, any- 
way. 

You weren’t very convincing, 
though, when you said you could 
still control me while I’m here 
and you’re still there. Didn’t you 
know, Joe, that people can some- 
times tell the truth from a lie, 
even when they don’t understand 
either of them? 

But all the same, Joe, I’m not 
running out on you. I’m going to 
keep reporting to you honestly 
what’s going on. 

Only if I’m wrong and you can 
reach clear up to here, Lord 
knows how many hundred years 
in the future, don’t put the bite 
on me simply because I cut off 
for a few minutes. I may have a 
good reason. 

Like just then. You can’t blame 
me for cutting off that way. 
Something so screwy just hap- 
pened that, for a moment, I 
thought the time-jump had 
driven me nuts. 

Along the street came a half 
dozen savages in animal skins. I 
looked at the other people around 
for my cue. They seemed sur- 
prised but not frightened. So I 
guessed it was just an act, some 
stunt or other, maybe part of a 
YOU WERE RIGHT, JOE 



parade, and tried to look sur- 
prised but not frightened, like 
everybody else. 

It was the savages who were 
frightened. They were yelling and 
running and glancing behind 
them. One carrying a stone club 
stopped in front of a woman a 
few yards from me, said some- 
thing and raised his club. 

Sooner or later, I had to find 
out if I was as strong as I looked. 
I stepped in and let the caveman 
have it on the chin. At the last 
second I realized that if I gave 
him all I had, I’d probably break 
his neck, so I pulled the punch. 

What do you know, Joe — I 
knocked a caveman twenty-five 
yards! It must have been all of 
that before he stopped staggering 
back and went down. He was 
plenty tough, because even after 
that, he wasn’t out. 

On the other hand, neither he 
nor his companions seemed to 
have any urge to come at me 
with their stone clubs. 

“Oh, you wonderful man!” said 
the girl I’d saved from a fatal 
headache. I’d give her a better 
line if I could, but that’s the only 
way I can translate it without the 
various suggestions which accom- 
panied it. 

/"kTHER people in the street 
were hurrying over. The sav- 
ages exchanged quick glances, 
turned tail and ran. The man I’d 



35 



floored was last in line for a 
while, but before they disap- 
peared from sight, he had pushed 
past the others and was in front 
again. That’s leadership for you. 

I shrugged and walked on, pre- 
tending this sort of thing hap- 
pened every day. Nobody stopped 
me, though there was excited 
conversation behind me. I didn’t 
look back. 

I don’t know what that incident 
was all about. I’d have stopped 
and talked about it, only I didn’t 
dare. 

Maybe not everybody is as 
civilized as the people in this city. 
There’s no law that children 
should go to school, for instance, 
so maybe the morons and drones 
of this community go outside and 
live as savages. Maybe there are 
people who don’t believe in civ- 
ilization. Maybe . 

Your guess is as good as mine, 
Joe. Probably better. 

There’s a park beside me now, 
and I’d go inside and stop to 
consider things, if not for one 
thing. 

It seems very likely to me that 
if girls make advances in the 
open street here, the parks must 
really be something for shy young 
guys like me. Flustering, to say 
the least. 

I’ve got a lot of things to 
find out, and sooner or later I’ve 
got to take the risk of talking to 
people. The trouble is, how can I 
36 



be natural when I feel as un- 
natural as a kitten laying eggs? 
Can I go up to the first pretty 
girl I see and say, “Take my 
hand, I’m a stranger in paradise”? 

I can’t. She would. 

Nevertheless, I’ll have to talk 
to somebody the first time I see 
an opportunity. 

There must be some kind of 
festival going on. Here’s another 
procession — about twenty peo- 
ple, coming along the side of the 
park. I can’t make out what 
they’re supposed to be, but they’re 
quite a sight. Like how Holly- 
wood in our time would repre- 
sent the people of the future. The 
women in brass bikinis and the 
men carrying enormous rayguns. 
And all as clean as if they’d been 
washed in the newest detergent. 
They look a bit puzzled. Maybe 
they’ve lost their way. 

I’m slipping into the park in 
case they ask me. If I keep mov- 
ing, the local talent won’t get a 
chance to take a good look at 
me and decide I’m just what they 
always wanted. 

Looks like I was right about 
the parks. It shouldn’t be so un- 
expected, I guess. It was in our 
time that necking in public came 
in. This is only a step further. 

Now what in hell’s this? 

TT> ELI EVE it or not, Joe, I just 
killed a saber-toothed tiger! 

I know that’s hard to swallow, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Joe. There were three of them, 
worse than anything you ever 
saw in a book or movie. They 
weren’t really saber-toothed tigers 
—they were something there isn’t 
a name for. Perhaps nobody yet 
dug up a skeleton of one of these 
things. 

There were these three tigers 
and half a dozen couples and me 
within thirty yards or so. I didn’t 
have much time to take a good 
squint at the beasts. The biggest 
of them came at me. I guess he 
figured that once I was out of the 
way, the other twelve packed 
lunches could be picked up with- 
out any argument. He was right 
at that. 

I’m not boasting, Joe— I stood 
where I was because I was too 
scared to run. I told you I’m big, 
but not compared with a saber- 
toothed tiger. 

He leaped at me, and I re- 
membered how Tarzan used to 
throw himself on tigers’ backs and 
get a half-Nelson grip on them. 
It didn’t seem too practical, how- 
ever. 

I dodged the first rush. Some- 
body threw a knife at the tiger 
and nearly hit me. I got hold of 
it and faced the beast again. I 
didn’t think for a moment that I 
was going to be able to do any- 
thing with the knife, which was 
a little folding one with a three- 
inch blade, but when you’re prac- 
tically naked and have to defend 
YOU WERE RIGHT, JOE 



yourself against a wild animal, 
you use a wooden sword if that’s 
the only thing available. 

The other specimens held off, 
waiting to see what happened. 
All the women were screaming, 
which helped, I guess. These crea- 
tures didn’t seem to know any 
more about human beings than 
human beings knew about them. 

The next time the tiger came 
at me, I ripped his side open as 
he passed, and from the roars he 
let loose, I began to think for 
the first time that maybe I would 
be alive in five minutes’ time, 
after all. 

It was that knife. I don’t know 
yet whether it was just sharp or 
if it had some other quality about 
it, but it cut through the beast’s 
flesh like water. And though a 
two-inch-deep cut all along his 
side didn’t by any means put 
him out of action, he didn’t like it. 

Why I had a chance, Joe, was 
because the poor ugly tiger, with 
all his strength, didn’t have re- 
action-time worth a damn. I could 
run around him like a speedboat 
circling a scow. Talk about tele- 
graphing punches— this creature 
didn’t telegraph them, he sent 
long letters about them by pony 
express. 

I slashed the tendons about his 
neck and it was no more dan- 
gerous than crossing a busy street 
at midday — less, probably. He 
struggled a lot and he took a 



37 



long time to die, but in the end 
he did die. 

I turned to the other tigers. 
They had seen what had hap- 
pened, however, and showed un- 
expected intelligence by running 
as hard as they could go for a 
clump of trees two hundred yards 
away. The beasts disappeared 
among them and no one was 
sorry. 

The six couples who were still 
around rushed up to congratulate 
me, pat me on the back and say 
I was wonderful. Two of the girls 
kissed me, and their escorts (I 
guess that’s the word) didn’t seem 
to mind. I didn’t mind too much 
myself. In time, I think I could 
get used to this world. 

But not to the sudden appear- 
ance of three unfriendly prehis- 
toric monsters. 

YWTE got out of the park with- 
out wasting any time about 
it, just in case what had hap- 
pened before might happen again. 

I found myself walking with a 
man and girl who talked so easily 
that I couldn’t let the chance 
slip. There’s no reserve among 
these people, Joe, and if they’re 
surprised at the things you ask, 
they hide it politely. 

It seemed that the arrival of 
the three tigers in the park had 
been as big a shock to them as it 
was to me. They weren’t used 
to things like that. None of them 
38 



showed any desire to become 
used to them, either. 

So the sudden arrival of three 
prehistoric monsters wasn’t a nor- 
mal hazard of living in this world. 

The couple I talked to had 
been as frightened as the rest, 
but they got over it pretty quick- 
ly. They’re not nervous, these 
people. Put them in danger and 
they’re frightened; remove the 
danger and they shrug and say 
they’re glad that’s over. 

Maybe that means there isn’t 
much mental illness about. So 
why the savages? 

These two people were soon 
willing to talk about anything at 
all, and a casual remark by the 
girl about my being alone gave 
me a chance to find out about 
the sex setup here. 

Seems what they’ve done is 
separate love and sex. If you 
want someone, you don’t have to 
pretend to yourself and her and 
everybody else that you’re in love 
with her. On the other hand, if 
you’re in love with a girl, you 
aren’t necessarily limited to her 
and her only. 

It’s not so very different from 
things in our time, except they 
don’t kid themselves and each 
other about it here. There’s still 
love and there’s still marriage, 
of course, but whether you’re in 
love or not, or married or not, the 
usual thing is to have a fairly full 
sex life. Unless you don’t want to. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



And all I have to do if I want 
to be left alone — which I do, at 
least meantime — is wear a silver 
bracelet on my right arm. Which 
I’m now doing. One of my new 
friends gave it to me. 

I didn’t stay with the people 
I’d met in the park; I slipped 
away from them as soon as I 
could. It seems to me the best 
way of gaining information is get- 
ting a little at a time from dif- 
ferent people. That way I won’t 
reveal the full extent of my ignor- 
ance to anybody, just little bits 
of it. 

I’m out of the park now and 
back on the main streets. There 
-shouldn’t be any saber-toothed 
tigers roaming around loose out 
here. 

These don’t look like main 
streets. I haven’t seen a car or 
plane or truck or bicycle or wheel- 
barrow. Everything that moves 
on wheels does so in special un- 
derground lanes. 

That’s the solution to the traf- 
fic problem — no traffic, no prob- 
lem. 

I don’t precisely know how you 
get to the underground lanes. 
That, however, is a question 
which can wait. 

Already I’m getting used to the 
style of architecture. I think I 
like it. 

Smooth curves have always 
been more beautiful than straight 
lines. We built in stone and in 



straight lines because we didn’t, 
know any better. 

Here most of the material is 
plastic of some kind — buildings, 
windows, pavement, everything. A 
moment ago, I bent to feel the 
pavement when no one was look- 
ing. It’s perfectly smooth, un- 
blemished, something between 
stone and rubber, but it’s too soft 
for stone and too hard for rub- 
ber. It’s obviously molded and it 
wears well. I couldn’t leave any 
marks on it with my fingernail, 
though it gave when I pressed it. 

In the streets, there’s nothing 
but people walking. People not in 
any hurry, all very young-looking 
(maybe the older people use the 
public transportation). Friendly 
people, happy people. 

I know what you’re thinking, 
Joe— there must be a catch some- 
where. 

All I know is, so far I haven’t 
seen it. Unless it’s the saber- 
toothed tigers. 

'T' HIS is getting beyond a joke. 

The caveman didn’t give me 
much trouble, I dodged the men 
with the rayguns and the prehis- 
toric monsters, and I managed to 
handle the saber-toothed tigers. 
But if this sort of thing goes on 
much longer, communication from 
me is going to stop very sud- 
denly. 

You won’t like that, Joe, be- 
cause you’ll never know what 



YOU WERE RIGHT, JOE 



39 



happened to me. I won’t like it 
myself. I like this place, except 
the hazards. I’d like to stay in it. 

All in one piece, though. 

This time it was men in red 
coats with the most primitive- 
looking muskets I ever saw. They 
were firing them, too. I didn’t see 
anybody hit, but that doesn’t 
mean these men weren’t shooting 
to kill. The guns they were using 
didn’t seem to be accurate to 
much closer than ninety degrees, 
which was just as well. 

Perhaps somebody mopped 
them up. I didn’t wait to see. 
Neither did anyone else. We 
didn’t exactly stampede in panic, 
but we didn’t waste any time get- 
ting out of range of those muskets. 

This wasn’t part of any game, 
Joe. I’m beginning to get ideas 
about this. 

Suppose they do time experi- 
ments here. Suppose there’s a sort 
of cowcatcher to brush off people 
and things who wander across the 
track. Or suppose there’s a sort 
of time magnetism which pulls 
all time travelers in here. 

How the saber-toothed tigers 
and the savages with stone clubs 
could be time travelers, I don’t 
know, but any theory’s better than 
none. 

Only how come I landed up 
just as you said I would, a duly 
accepted member of this world, 
dressed in the right clothes and 
twice the man I was before, while 

40 



all the others appear exactly as 
they were in their own time? 

I guess you’ve got an answer, 
Joe, as usual. Wish you could 
pass it on to me. 

Here’s something else. About a 
dozen people, men and women, in 
ball dress. Seventeenth century, I 
guess. They’re blinking and 
staring around. 

Gosh, I thought we invented 
the lowcut dress. The dress that 
redhead’s wearing wouldn’t get 
past the Hays Office if it was 
three inches higher. No, that’s an 
exaggeration. It wouldn’t get past 
the Hays Office if it was four 
inches higher. 

’V7" OU probably got some of that, 
1 Joe. 

It was awkward. These refugees 
from the seventeenth century 
picked me to talk to. The red- 
head came straight to me. Her 
manner was prim and correct, 
which showed she was a lady, but 
her eyes were no lady’s. They 
were even more inviting than 
curious. 

I treated her like a sister. 

The trouble was, I could un- 
derstand what these people were 
saying and no one else who was 
around could. I found it hard to 
make up my mind whether to 
pretend not to understand them 
or not. 

I guessed from the way they 
blinked and shaded their eyes 

GAIA XY SCIENCE FICTION 



that it had been night where they 
came from. As a matter of fact, 
they’d been at a ball. 

Naturally they wanted to know 
what it was all about. Before I’d 
really made up my mind whether 
to admit I could understand them 
or not, I found myself answering 
their questions. 

Since this group, unlike the 
redcoats, was obviously puzzled 
rather than hostile, they were 
soon in the center of an excited 
crowd, chattering away but un- 
able to understand a word. 

I kept saying a word or two 
to the people beside me as well 
as talking to the strangers, to 
make it clear which side I was 
on. People offered me suggestions 
about what to tell the visitors and 
I did as they said. No one seemed 
much surprised that only I could 
talk to them. Everybody assumed, 
I guess, that I was a history stu- 
dent or something. 

This went on for about ten 
minutes. Then the strangers 
winked out like a light and we 
were left staring stupidly at each 
other. 

I didn’t draw attention to my- 
self this time by being the first 
to go on my way. But when it 
was clear that nobody suspected 
I knew any more about the in- 
cident than they did, I made my 
escape as soon as I decently could. 

One side issue I’d like to men- 
tion is this, Joe. Humanity really 
YOU WERE RIGHT, JOE 



is on the upgrade. Looking at 
these people from the seventeenth 
century and comparing them with 
the people here, I couldn’t doubt 
that there had been a big advance 
in intelligence, looks, poise and 
everything else that counts. It 
was like seeing a mongrel beside 
a pedigree pup. 

Even the redhead, who obvi- 
ously regarded herself as a 
beauty, was nothing special com- 
pared with any girl in the crowd. 

I’d hardly got away from that 
when, in the very next street, I 
saw a bullfight, of all things. At 
first the bull and the matador 
didn’t seem to be aware that 
things weren’t what they’d been 
a few minutes before. 

Then the matador looked up 
and stared, petrified. The bull 
nearly got him. He turned just in 
time, but his mind was no longer 
on the job. I don’t blame him. 

The bull and the matador didn’t 
last as long as the visitors from the 
seventeenth century. They 
couldn’t have been here more than 
a couple of minutes. 

I hope all these people got 
back where they came from. I 
liked that redhead, despite her 
gap teeth. I didn’t care for the 
matador and the bull, but I don’t 
wish them any harm. 

J OE, I don’t know how to say 
this. 

I’ve been picked up. It wasn’t 



41 



an arrest — they made that clear 
from the start. In fact, they’re 
very interested in me and it looks 
as if I’m going to have a great 
time here as the Hercules from 
the Past. 

There were three men and two 
women, and they apologized for 
interfering with my liberty. Seems 
I have the same rights as every- 
body else here. 

But there was desperate ur- 
gency, they said. They promised 
to explain everything later. Mean- 
while, they had to insist on tak- 
ing me somewhere in a hurry. 

They knew my name and all 
about me. They even knew I 
wasn’t the same as I’d been in 
my own time, because though 
nothing like this has ever hap- 
pened, once it had happened it 
took them less than half an hour 
to figure out exactly what had 
happened. 

Joe, I feel like a heel. But 
they told me to tell you this. 
They told me they felt worse 
about it than I do. 

You see, if I’d simply landed 
up here and made no attempt to 
get in touch with you, they might 
never have known what had hap- 
pened. But this link with you is 
the thing that’s caused all the 
trouble. 



We’re holding open a hole in 
time, Joe. And as long as it’s 
open, anything, anywhere, any- 
time, can fall right through the 
hole. 

They told me there’s a sort of 
dimensional elastic stretched all 
through time because of you and 
me. They can’t leave it like that 
any longer. It could pull time 
itself apart. 

Joe, you always said it was up 
to everybody to look out for him- 
self. That’s what they’re doing, 
so you were right about that, too. 

I mean you’ve been right about 
so many things that I got them 
to let me explain what will hap- 
pen so you’ll have a chance to 
figure a way out. 

You see, they’re cutting the 
elastic, Joe. And you know what’s 
going to happen? They say I’ll 
be all right because I’m here and 
they’re going to cut it on my 
side. 

But when it comes shooting 
back through time, it’s going to 
pack one hell of a wallop. 

You’ve got a few minutes to 
work it out. You can do it, Joe. 
After all, look how often you 
were right. 

Good luck, Joe — and take care 
of yourself.

BY WILLY LEY 



ON WITH THE 
DODO HUNT! 

A BOUT 130 miles of open 
sea separate the two 
islands of Mauritius and 
Reunion. This is not a long dis- 
tance for birds with a reasonable 
power of flight and it is only logi- 
cal that many birds are common 
to both islands and even to Mada- 
gascar. For a flightless bird, how- 
ever, 130 miles of open sea might

43 



as well be 3,000 miles — it could 
no more cross the one than the 
other. Hence it is obvious that 
the Mauritius dodo, of which 
Peter Mundy said specifically 
that it “can neither flye nor 
swimm,” could not cross over to 
Reunion. Nor could a flightless 
bird of Reunion cross over to 
Mauritius. 

Logically, then, if there also 
was a dodo on Reunion, it could 
not be expected to be the same 
as the dodo of Mauritius. Similar, 
yes, but only that. Their ances- 
tors, presumably still capable of 
flight when they somehow got to 
the Mascarene islands, were no 
doubt the same. But even a short 
separation, as geologists speak of 
time, would produce very notice- 
able differences. 

Well, there was a dodo on Re- 
union and it did differ from the 
Mauritius dodo, but for more than 
a hundred years, naturalists did 
their best to overlook this differ- 
ence. Yet the very first witness 
pointed it out. He was an English- 
man by the name of J. Tatton 
who, in 1625, published an ac- 
count of a voyage made a dozen 
years earlier under Captain 
Castleton. 

Reporting on Reunion, he 
wrote: “There is a store of Land- 
fowl, both small and great, plentie 
of Doves, great Parrats, and such 
like; and a great fowl of the 
bigness of a Turkie, very fat, and 

44 



so short-winged that they cannot 
flie, being white, and in a manner 
tame; and so are all other fowles, 
as having not been troubled or 
feared with shot.” 

The only other witness who 
saw the Reunion dodo on the 
island and wrote about it was the 
Dutch traveler Willem Ijsbrants- 
zoon Bontekoe van Hoorn. He 
spent three weeks there in 1619, 
and not only described what is 
unmistakably a dodo, but even 
referred to it as a Dad-eersen. Un- 
fortunately, he did not say any- 
thing about its color. 

T ATER researchers, though, 
kept coming across pictures 
which did not jibe with the other 
dodo pictures. Not only was the 
plumage white with yellow wing 
feathers, but they were different 
in other respects, too. The feet 
were more slender, the tail was 
different and so was the bill. 

Now it is true that there are 
sketches of the Mauritius dodo 
in which the bill looks different, 
the reason being that the moult- 
ing dodo also shed the sheath 
of the bill. But these white dodos 
seemed to have their sheath in 
place. The pictures are all by 
just two artists, Pieter Holsteyn 
(around 1640) and Pieter 
Withoos (around 1685). Since it 
is most unlikely that a full-grown 
specimen would live for forty-five 
years in captivity, this indicates 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Fig. 1: Sketch of the White Dodo of Reunion, by Pieter Holsteyn, early seventeenth century 



that two specimens of the white 
dodo reached Europe. 

The older naturalists failed to 
draw a clear distinction and even 
H. E. Strickland, in his monumen- 
tal work on the dodo (1848), did 
not do so. 

The white dodo was introduced 
to science as a distinct species 
as late as 1907, when the Hon. 
W. Rothschild published his work 
Extinct Birds. (It had the sub- 
title: “An attempt to unite in one 
Volume a short Account of those 
Birds which have become extinct 
in historical Times, etc.,” but the 
short account turned out to be 
in folio with no less than 45 color 



plates.) The scientific name pro- 
posed for it was Didus borboni- 
cus. In 1937, Dr. Hachisuka 
changed the scientific name (for 
various reasons that do not in- 
terest us here) to Victoriornis 
imperialis. 

Probably because Reunion is 
more mountainous than Mauri- 
tius, the white dodo lived longer 
than the gray dodo. There is a 
report that Mahe de la Bourdon- 
nais, when he was governor of 
both islands, sent one to France. 
There is no record from the 
other end — we don’t know 
whether it got to France or not 
— but Mahe de la Bourdonnais 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



45 



was governor from 1735-1746, 
long after the Mauritius dodo was 
extinct. 

The Reunion dodo fails to be 
present for the first time in a 
survey made in 1801. It must 
have succumbed to dogs, rats and 
pigs during the latter half of the 
eighteenth century. That there 
was still something else to be 
said about Reunion was not even 
suspected until recently. But this 
additional mystery can best be 
explained with a detour to the 
third of the Mascarene islands, 
Rodriguez. 

As has been told in the pre- 
ceding issue, the island was first 
reached by the Portuguese Diogo 
Fernandes Pereira in 1507. It 
took almost two centuries until 
settlers got there, and even these 
went to Rodriguez only as a 
second choice. 

They were French Huguenots 
who were supposed to go to Re- 
union from Holland. It was a 
small group of only eleven men. 
Their chosen leader was a man 
a few years past fifty at the time 
whose name was Francois Leguat. 
His younger brother was also in 
the group. 

TP HE Dutch ship, with the 
-*• French Protestants aboard, 
left Holland on September 4, 
1690, and arrived at Reunion on 
April 3 of the following year. 
What happened then is not quite 

46 



clear, but it seems that it had 
been believed in Holland that 
the French had abandoned the 
island. When the ship’s captain 
realized that they had not, he did 
not land but set course for Rod- 
riguez, where the French stayed 
for about two years. Then they 
built a boat and sailed for Mauri- 
tius. 

A weird and senseless odyssey 
was the result of this act. About 
half a year after they had landed, 
they were discovered by the 
governor who, after a few months 
of deliberation, banished them to 
a small rocky island offshore. 
There they were kept prisoners 
for three years and then shipped, 
still as prisoners, to Batavia. A 
year later, they were released and 
sent back to Holland as free men, 
where they arrived in June, 1698. 

Francois Leguat did not stay 
long, but went to England, where 
he rewrote the journal he had 
kept all along for publication. 
In 1708, both Leguat’s French 
original and an English transla- 
tion appeared. 

Other voyagers had said before 
Leguat that there were “dodos” 
on Rodriguez, but Leguat was the 
first man who had lived there for 
any length of time. Moreover, 
Leguat could draw. He provided 
illustrations for his book and 
there can be little doubt that he 
had made the sketches on the 
spot, because some of them are 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Fig. 2: The Solitaire of Rodriguez, as pic- 
tured in Francois Leguat's book of 
1708. Drawing probably by Leguat 
himself 

rather complicated maps and 
plans. 

“Of all the Birds in the Island,” 
the English edition read, “the 
most remarkable is that which 
goes by the name of Solitary, 
tho’ there are abundance of them. 
The Feathers of the Males are 
of a brown grey Colour: the Feet 
and Beak are like a Turkey’s, but 
a little more crooked. They have 
scarce any Tail, but their Hind- 
part covered with Feathers is 
roundish, like the Crupper of a 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Horse; they are taller than Tur- 
keys . The Bone of. their Wing 
grows greater towards the Ex- 
tremity, and forms a little round 
Mass under the Feathers, as big 
as a Musket Ball. That and its 
Beak are the chief Defence of 
this Bird. ’Tis very hard to catch 
it in the Woods, but easie in open 
Places, because we run faster 
than they . Some of the Males 
weigh forty-five Pounds.” 

L EGUAT reported that the 
males were brown in color, 
the females either brown “or fair, 
the colour of blonde hair”; most 
likely the brown ones were older 
females. He also mentioned that 
the females had a “head-band, 
like the head-band of Widows, 
high upon their Beak,” and that 
lighter feathers on their chest 
formed an outline like the bosom 
of a woman. Leguat’s drawing, 
therefore, is that of a female, 
since the males lacked these char- 
acteristics. 

There is no other drawing of 
a solitary besides Leguat’s. How- 
ever, just as in the case of the 
Mauritius dodo, remains of the 
solitary have been excavated on 
Rodriguez, so that a few nearly 
complete skeletons could be con- 
structed. 

Again the story has a few 
wrinkles which were added later. 

In 1761, one of the famous 
transits of the planet Venus 

47 



across the face of the Sun was 
due to take place and Rodriguez 
happened to be in such a geo- 
graphical position that a fine ob- 
servation of the transit could be 
made from there. The man to go 
to Rodriguez for this purpose was 
Abbe Pingre. In addition to doing 
the astronomical job for which 
he had taken the trip, Abbe 
Pingre reported that the solitaries 
were still around. He is the last 
man to have seen them. 

Some five years later, Pingre’s 
colleague and compatriot Le 
Monnier decided that the expedi- 
tion should be honored in some 
manner. He had discovered a 
number of small stars in the space 
between the constellations Libra, 
Scorpio and Draco which could 
be put together into a new con- 
stellation. He was going to call it 
Solitarius to honor Pingre, Rod- 
riguez and the transit of Venus 
expedition. 

But he needed a picture of the 
solitary, and since his compatriot 
Brisson had recently published 
an enormous book on birds, he 
felt sure that it would be in 
there. Looking through the en- 
tries, he found a solitaire listed 
and copied the picture onto his 
star map. I don’t know whether 
Le Monnier ever learned that 
the picture he used was that of 
Turdus solitarius, the solitary 
thrush! 

The other wrinkle is tied up

with the name of Geoffroy Atkin-

ature who has written several 
books with titles like “The

Literature before 1700,” “The

Literature, 1700 to 1720” and so 
forth. Personally, I failed to be en- 
chanted by them; they are solid 
work, but I had the impression 
that Atkinson knew literature and 
nothing else. 

Now I learn from Hachisuka 
that Atkinson, in 1921, went over- 
board with his interest in extra- 
ordinary voyages and declared 
that Leguat never traveled! He 
could “trace” every item in Le-

guat’s journal to its “sources.” 
The account of the Cape of Good 
Hope came from this book, the 
sea turtles from that book, the 
story of his imprisonment from 
still another book, the building 
of a boat from somebody else’s 
memoirs. 

biologist who read this 
began to wonder. Leguat had 
said things about the anatomy of 
the solitary which were correct, 
as the skeletons proved, but which 
could not be found in any other 
book. 

While the biologist was still 
brooding over the article, two 
French librarians very politely 
requested that Atkinson answer 
a few simple questions, to wit: 

If Leguat had never rounded 
the Cape of Good Hope, why do 
the archives of Cape Town tell 
about the ship, its arrival, depar- 
ture and so forth, all with the 
same dates as given by Leguat? 
Then, if Leguat never saw Rod- 
riguez, why does the earliest map 
of the island (other than Leguat’s 
own) name a few places after 
him? Why are there official re- 
ports from Mauritius telling of 
the arrival, imprisonment and de- 
portation of refugees from Rod- 
riguez? And, finally, why is there 
correspondence with the fleet 
commander about the trip to and 
return from Batavia? 

Well, Atkinson did accomplish

one thing. Before him, nobody 
had doubted the authenticity of 
Leguat’s journal. Now we are sure 
that it cannot be doubted. 

It remains to tell the scientific 
name of Leguat’s solitary. It is 
Pezophaps solitarius. The first of 
these two names is put together 
from two Greek words: pezos, 
which means “pedestrian,” and 
phaps, which means “pigeon.” 

Some readers who know some- 
thing about the dodo’s story may 
have wondered why I did not 
quote some of the well-known 
source material about the sub- 
ject. For example, Sir Hamon 
L’Estrange’s account in his 
memoirs: 

About 1638, as I walked London 
streets, I saw the picture of a 
strange fowle hong out upon a cloth 
and myselfe with one or two more 
then in company went in to see it. 
It was kept in a chamber, and was 
a great fowle somewhat bigger than 
the largest Turky Cock, and so 
legged and footed, but stouter and 
thicker and of a more erect shape, 
coloured before like the breast of 
a young cock fesan, and on the back 
of dunn or dearc colour. The keeper 
called it a Dodo, and in the ende of 
a chymney in the chamber there 
lay a heape of large pebble stones, 
whereof hee gave it many in our 
sight, some as big as nutmegs and 
the keeper told us that she eats 
them (conducing to digestion), and 
though I remember not how far the 
keeper was questioned therein, yet 
I am confident that afterwards shee 
cast them all again. 



IVT ^ rea son for not bringing 
-L’-®- this up earlier is that this 
statement almost certainly does 
not refer to the dodo, even though 
the keeper called the bird by that 
name. The coloration does not fit 
the gray Mauritius dodo and cer- 
tainly not the white Reunion 
dodo. Nor does the “more erect 
shape” as compared to the turkey. 

As Dr. Hachisuka points out 
emphatically, this is a description 
of a bird of the type of the soli- 
tary, not of the dodo type. It must 
have been the use of the name 
dodo which made earlier re- 
searchers accept Sir Hamon’s ac- 
count as one of the dodo and to 
surmise that this was the speci- 
men which later was in Trade- 
scant’s Museum and finally thrown 
away. 

There have always been some 
descriptions of a bird from Re- 
union which did not quite “fit.” 

There was the narrative of a 
Frenchman named Carre who 
went to Reunion in 1668: “I saw 
a kind of bird in this place which 
I have not found elsewhere: it 
is that which the inhabitants call 
the Oiseau Solitaire, for, to be 
sure, it loves solitude and only 
frequents the most secluded 
places; one never sees two or 
more together; it is always alone. 
It is not unlike a turkey, if it 
did not have longer legs.” 

Another very similar descrip- 
tion came from the Sieur DuBois 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



50 



who arrived in Reunion in 1669. 
He listed the birds he saw, and 
when he came to Solitaires, he 
stated: “These birds are so called 
because they always go alone. They 
are as big as a large goose and 
have white plumage with the tips 
of the wings and tail black. The 
tail feathers are like those of an 
ostrich, they have a long neck, 
and the beak is like that of the 
Woodcock, but larger; the legs 
and feet are like those of a 
turkey.” 

Carre’s and especially DuBois’ 
statements led Strickland to sus- 
pect that maybe Reunion had 
both a dodo and a solitary. 

Rothschild, after weighing all 
the evidence, also said that there 
must have been two different 
birds on Reunion, either two kinds 
of dodos which were quite far 
apart in appearance, or else one 
dodo and one solitary resembling 
the Rodriguez type. 

A. C. Oudemans, ten years after 
Rothschild, took the position that 
all this was a mistake. The men 
who reported on them probably 
were not too observant as regards 
the moulting stages of the birds. 
Oudemans’ main argument is 
that nobody described both birds, 
so to speak, side by side. 

This is admittedly sad, yet it 
so happens that nobody did. But 
if you read what reports there 
are, you get the impression that 
the bird called solitaire seems to 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



have been quite numerous, while 
the white dodo obviously was not. 
Moreover, Reunion is large 
enough so that the two birds 
could have had different habitats. 

Somewhat ironically, Prof. 
Oudemans himself produced evi- 
dence for a solitary in addition 
to the one on Rodriguez. 

During the First World War, 
Prof. Oudemans, vacationing with 
his wife, looked at the gable stone 
of a house in Veere, on the island 
of Walcheren. The stone said that 
the bird pictured was an ostrich. 
It also clearly gave the date: 
1561. Oudemans did not need 
long to see that the bird, what- 
ever it was, was not an ostrich. 
But it could be a dodo. If so, this 
was the earliest dodo picture on 
record. 

The picture is reproduced here. 
Prof. Oudemans sent me a print 
in 1936 when we had correspon- 
dence mostly about the Loch 
Ness animal. 

I T must be a gaunt dodo, Oude- 
mans felt, for it certainly could 
not be a Rodriguez solitary. Le- 
guat had been very specific about 
its being tailless with a round 
feather-covered rear end. Look at 
the tail feathers, Oudemans wrote. 
Almost like those of an Airikaan- 
sch struys (African ostrich) or 
like those of a dodo. 

Well, the answer is that it was 
not a Rodriguez solitary but a 

51 



Reunion solitary (now called 
Ornithaptera solitaria) and the 
tail feathers, so prominent on the 
old Dutch gable stone, are just 
as prominent in the so-called 
dodo of Florence, one of the pic- 
tures discovered by Dr. S. Killer- 
mann. This picture is now taken 
to portray a male Reunion, while 
another picture, also discovered 
by Killermann, shows a female. 
Comparing this picture with the 
one of a Rodriguez female by Le- 
guat, one can see how the two 
birds resembled each other and 
in what respects they differed. 

There is one more picture of 
the same bird (not reproduced 
here) which is now at McGill 
University in Montreal. It is of 
Italian origin, being picture no. 
29 in the so-called “Feather Book” 
made by Dionisio Minaggio in 
Milan in 1618. It consists of 156 
large pictures with birds, prac- 
tically all of them hunting scenes. 

The interesting point is that 
the birds are never painted. The 
real beaks, feet and feathers of 
birds have been used. Unhappily, 
the picture of the Reunion soli- 
tary is “faked.” That is to say 
that legs and beak have been 
painted and that the feathers 
used for the body are those of. 
other birds. But it is undoubtedly 
the same bird as a dodo of 
Florence. 

That attempts to ship Reunion 
solitaries to Europe were made 

52 



is stated by Carre, who says that 
two of them were caught to be 
sent to the king (of France) but 
aboard ship they died of “melan- 
choly.” In a few other cases, ship- 
ment must have been successful. 
The 1561 stone masonry in 
Holland must have had a model. 
One male must have arrived in 
Italy around 1618. We do know 
that there was one on exhibit 
in London around 1638 and there 
is evidence that a female got to 
Vienna in or about 1657. 

HP HE story has a postscript 
called the dodo of Nazareth 
or, more learnedly, Didus naza- 
renus. 

I thought the case had been 
nicely cleared up by Iosif Kris- 
tianovitch Hamel of the Russian 
Imperial Academy of Science in 
St. Petersburg, which published 
a fairly long study in its Bulletin 
of the Physical-Mathematical 
Section in 1848. 

Professor Hamel, after reading 
all the sources, had found a con- 
vincing piece of evidence. You 
remember from last month’s 
column that the Dutch called 
the dodos Walghvogels or “naus- 
eating birds” because their taste 
was so atrocious. (One of them 
declared firmly that the dodo was 
for wonder, not for food.) The 
French had translated Walgh- 
vogels correctly into oiseaux de 
nausee. But one Francois Cauche, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



who spent two weeks on Mauri- 
tius in 1638, wrote about the 
dodos nous les appellions oiseaux 
de Nazaret. 

Cauche probably did not try 
to taste dodo and did not see why 
the birds should be nauseating, 
so he thought that the word 
nausee was actually Nazaret, 
which sounds somewhat similar 
in French. And there was a place 
called Nazareth nearby on a nau- 
tical chart. There still is, but it is 
now labeled a “bank” while on 
earlier charts there is an island 
by that name. Professor Hamel 
thought this was a simple mis- 
take. 

He may be right. But when 
Prof. Oudemans checked old 
charts systematically, he found 
a few in which the name of Naza- 
reth is not placed next to an 
island where we know that there 
is no island, but near the exist- 
ing, if tiny, island which on mod- 
ern charts appears as He Trome- 
lin. 

Nobody knows much about lie 
Tromelin. It cannot be of any 
importance because the latest edi- 



tion of the Admiralty Charts 
states that its position may be 
five miles off on the map. If it 
were of any importance, this 
would surely have been ascer- 
tained by now. Maybe the map- 
makers who produced the old 
charts seen by Oudemans simply 
lettered Nazareth next to it be- 
cause there was supposed to be 
such a place and it was the only 
island left in the whole area, the 
other suspected islands having 
turned into banks and shoals. 

But Oudemans said that Didus 
nazarenus cannot be dismissed 
completely until lie Tromelin has 
been carefully investigated. Not 
that he expected to find live 
dodos of any kind; he meant sub- 
fossil remains like those found 
on Mauritius and on Rodriguez. 

In principle, Oudemans is na- 
turally correct; as long as there is 
an uninvestigated lead left, the 
book should not be closed. 

No such investigation has taken 
place. But until it is and the facts 
prove otherwise, I prefer to accept 
Prof. Hamel’s explanation.

CONCLUSION OF A 2-FART SERIAL 



By FREDERIK POHL and C. M. KORNBLUTH 
Illustrated by WOOD 



There was a chink in the invulnerability of 
the Pyramids — whoever harvests whatever is 
ripe is bound to pick something poisonous — 
but was a Son of the Wolf poisonous enough?

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



SYNOPSIS 




G LENN Tropile looked like 
any other Citizen in 
Earth’s tiny, tattered pop- 
ulation, but there was a difference. 
Where Citizens made the best of 
things, Tropile fought. Where Citi- 
zens accommodated their small, 
restricted lives to a starvation diet 
and an utter abandonment of hope, 
Tropile struggled— and won. It was 
Tropile’s nature to win, always. 
For Tropile was what the beaten 
remnants of humanity termed: A 
Son of the Wolf. 

Roget Germyn, on the other 
hand, was a most proper Citizen 
in every way. He was skilled in 
the Five Gestures and the art of 
Conversation in Rhymed Couplets; 
he never said “no,” for saying “no” 
was crude and might hurt some- 
one’s feelings; his table manners 
were exquisite; and he would 
never, never take advantage of an- 
other human being. 

Also, like every other Citizen on 
Earth, he was slowly starving to 
death. For Earth was no longer the 
comfortable, warm planet that had 
spun around old Sol for millions 
or billions of years. It had been 
stolen, raped and looted by the 
curious beings from outer space 
that the surviving humans knew 
only as— 

The Pyramids, owners of a 
wild extrastellar planet that had 
come into the Solar System and, 



WOLFBANE 



55 



without fuss or struggle, neatly 
lifted old Earth from its orbit and 
drawn it away. Why? Humans 
didn’t know. How? Humans had 
no idea. 

All that any man knew about 
the Pyramids was, first, that there 
was a single Pyramid on Earth, 
perched silent and motionless atop 
Mount Everest; second, that with- 
out the Pyramids to rekindle an 
artificial sun in the skies every five 
years, humanity would freeze and 
die— as it was very near to doing 
anyhow; third, that every once in 
a while a Citizen, properly Medi- 
tating in the ecstasy of concen- 
tration which was every Citizen’s 
desire, would disappear — would 
be Translated, as they called it. 
That was all they knew, nothing 
more. 

r I 'HEY didn’t, for example, 
know that, to the Pyramids, 
Earth was nothing more than a 
sort of floating wristwatch mine, 
from which at certain times Com- 
ponents could be harvested— hu- 
man Components, living men and 
women, whose brains could be 
linked into the Pyramids’ planet- 
sized computers. 

But vanquished Earth was not 
quite dead; Glenn Tropile was not 
alone. Condemned as a Wolf, 
threatened with the form of execu- 
tion called The Donation of the 
Spinal Tap, Tropile made his es- 
cape— and was picked up by an- 

56 



other Wolf in the wilderness. 

Haendl was his name. He was 
not a Citizen; there was no proper 
courtesy in his manner, no submis- 
sive resignation to hunger and 
cold. Haendl believed in fighting ! 
Nor was he alone; there was a 
community of Wolves in the ruin 
of old Princeton University. There 
they had laboriously reconstructed 
weapons— guns, tanks, even air- 
craft. From there, they planned to 
retake the Earth from its alien 
masters, the Pyramids. 

But— could they? 

A mightier, richer Earth had 
thrown every weapon it owned 
against the Pyramids when first 
they came. And the result was 
nothing. 

It was as though the weapons 
of Man had not existed. 

The Pyramids not only were not 
harmed; they didn’t seem to know 
that the weapons were being used. 
Tanks, guns, planes— even a hydro- 
gen bomb had spent itself useless- 
ly against the Pyramids! 

Troubled, Tropile sat alone, 
wondering, worrying. He began to 
fall into a mood of single-minded 
concentration, began to Meditate, 
began to think upon the meta- 
physical questions that were every 
proper Citizen’s first concern . 

A Component was harvested. 
Glenn Tropile was Translated — 
swept up and out to the alien 
planet that was the home of the 
Pyramids themselves.

¥TAENDL plodded angrily 
through the high grass toward 
the dull throb of the diesel. 

Maybe it had been a mistake 
to take this Glenn Tropile into 
the colony. He was more Citizen 
than Wolf— no, cancel that, Haendl 
thought; he was more Wolf than 
Citizen. But the Wolf in him was 
tainted with sheep’s blood. He 
competed like a Wolf, but in spite 
of everything, he refused to give 
up some of his sheep’s ways. Medi- 
tation. He had been cautioned 
against that. But had he given it 
up? 

He had not. 

If it had been entirely up to 
Haendl, Glenn Tropile would have 
found himself back among the 
sheep or dead. Fortunately for 
Tropile, it was not entirely up to 
Haendl. The community of Wolves 
was by no means a democracy, 
but the leader had a certain 
responsibility to his constituents, 
and the responsibility was this: He 
couldn’t afford to be wrong. Like 
the Old Gray Wolf who protected 
Mowgli, he had to defend his ac- 
tions against attack; if he failed 
to defend, the pack would pull 
him down. 

And Innison thought they 
needed Tropile— not in spite of 
the taint of the Citizen that he 
bore, but because of it. 

Haendl bawled: “Tropile! Tro- 



pile, where are you?” There was 
only the wind and the thrum of 
the diesel. It was enormously ir- 
ritating. Haendl had other things 
to do than to chase after Glenn 
Tropile. And where was he? There 
was the diesel, idling wastfully; 
there the end of the patterned fur- 
rows Tropile had plowed. There 
a small fire, burning— 

And there was Tropile. 

Haendl stopped, frozen, his 
mouth opened, about to yell Tro- 
pile’s name. 

It was Tropile, all right, staring 
with concentrated, oyster-eyed 
gaze at the fire and the little pot 
of water it boiled. Staring. Medi- 
tating. And over his head, like 
flawed glass in a pane, was the 
thing Haendl feared most of all 
things on Earth. It was an Eye. 

Tropile was on the very verge 
of being Translated . what- 
ever that was. 

Time, maybe, to find out what 
that was! Haendl ducked back 
into the shelter of the high grass, 
knelt, plucked his radio communi- 
cator from his pocket, urgently 
called. 

“Innison! Innison, will some- 
body, for God’s sake, put Innison 
on!” 

Seconds passed. Voices an- 
swered. Then there was Innison. 

“Innison, listen! You wanted to 
catch Tropile in the act of Medi- 
tation? All right, you’ve got him. 
The old wheat field, south end,

under the elms around the creek. 
Get here fast, Innison— there’s an 
Eye forming above him!” 

Luck! Lucky that they were 
ready for this, and only by luck, 
because it was the helicopter that 
Innison had patiently assembled 
for the attack on Everest that was 
ready now, loaded with instru- 
ments, planned to weigh and meas- 
ure the aura around the Pyramid 
—now at hand when they needed 
it. 

That was luck, but there was 
driving hurry involved, too; it was 
only a matter of minutes before 
Haendl heard the wobbling drone 
of the copter, saw the vanes flut- 
tering low over the hedges, drop- 
ping to earth behind the elms. 

Haendl raised himself cautious- 
ly and peered. Yes, Tropile was 
still there, and the Eye still above 
him! But the noise of the helicop- 
ter had frayed the spell. Tropile 
stirred. The Eye wavered and 
shook — 

But did not vanish. 

Thanking what passed for his 
God, Haendl scuttled circuitously 
around the elms and joined In- 
nison at the copter. Innison was 
furiously closing switches and 
pointing lenses. 

They saw Tropile sitting there, 
the Eye growing larger and closer 
over his head. They had time- 
plenty of time; oh, nearly a minute 
of time. They brought to bear on 
the silent and unknowing form of 

58 



Glenn Tropile every instrument 
that the copter carried. They were 
waiting for Tropile to disappear— 
He did. 

TNNISON and Haendl hunched 
at the thunderclap as air 
rushed in to replace him. 

“We’ve got what you wanted,” 
Haendl said harshly. “Let’s read 
some instruments.” 

Throughout the Translation, 
high-tensile magnetic tape on a 
madly spinning drum had been 
hurtling under twenty-four record- 
ing heads at a hundred feet a sec- 
ond. Output to the recording heads 
had been from every kind of meas- 
uring device they had been able 
to conceive and build, all loaded 
on the helicopter for use on 
Mount Everest— all now pointed 
directly at Glenn Tropile. 

They had, for the instant of 
Translation, readings from one 
microsecond to the next on the 
varying electric, gravitational, mag- 
netic, radiant and molecular-state 
conditions in his vicinity. 

They got back to Innison’s 
workshop, and the laboratory in- 
side it, in less than a minute; but 
it took hours of playing back the 
magnetic pulses into machines that 
turned them into scribed curves 
on coordinate paper before Inni- 
son had anything resembling an 
answer. 

He said: “No mystery. I mean 
no mystery except the speed. Want 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to know what happened to Tro- 
pile?” 

“I do,” said Raendl. 

“A pencil of electrostatic force 
maintained by a pinch effect 
bounced down the approximate 
azimuth of Everest— God knows 
how they handled the elevation— 
and charged him and the area 
positive. A big charge, clear off the 
scale. They parted company. He 
was bounced straight up. A meter 
off the ground, a correcting vec- 
tor was applied. When last seen, 
he was headed fast in the direc- 
tion of the Pyramids’ binary— fast! 
So fast that I would guess he’ll get 
there alive. It takes an appreciable 
time, a good part of a second, for 
his protein to coagulate enough to 
make him sick and then kill him. 
If the Pyramids strip the charges 
off him immediately on arrival, as 
I should think they will, he’ll live.” 

“Friction—” 

“Be damned to friction,” Inni- 
son said calmly. “He carried a 
packet of air with him and there 
was no friction. How? I don’t 
know. How are they going to keep 
him alive in space, without the 
charges that hold air? I don’t 
know. If they don’t maintain the 
charges, can they beat the speed of 
light? I don’t know. I can tell you 
what happened. I can’t tell you 
how.” 

Haendl stood up thoughtfully. 
“It’s something,” he said grudging- 
ly. 



“It’s more than we’ve ever had 
—a complete reading at the in- 
stant of Translation!” 

“We’ll get more,” Haendl prom- 
ised. “Innison, now that you know 
what to look for, go on looking for 
it. Keep every possible detection 
device monitored twenty-four 
hours a day. Turn on everything 
you’ve got that’ll find a sign of 
imposed modulation. At any sign 
—or at anybody’s hunch that there 
might be a sign— I’m to be called. 
If I’m eating. If I’m sleeping. If 
I’m enjoying with a woman. Call 
me, you hear? Maybe you were 
right about Tropile; maybe he did 
have some use. He might give the 
Pyramids a bellyache.” 

Innison, flipping the magnetic 
tape drum to rewind, said thought- 
fully: “It’s too bad they’ve got 
him. We could have used some 
more readings.” 

“Too bad?” Haendl laughed 
sharply. “This time they’ve got 
themselves a Wolf.” 

nPHE Pyramids did have a Wolf 
—a fact which did not matter 
in the least to them. 

It is not possible to know what 
“mattered” to a Pyramid except 
by inference. But it is possible to 
know that they had no way of tell- 
ing Wolf from Citizen. 

The planet which was their 
home — Earth’s old Moon — was 
small, dark, atmosphereless and 
waterless. It was completely built 



WOLFBANE 



59 



over, much of it with its propul- 
sion devices. 

In the old days, when technolo- 
gy had followed war, luxury, gov- 
ernment and leisure, the Pyramids’ 
sun had run out of steam; and at 
about the same time, they had 
run out of the Components they 
imported from a neighboring 
planet. They used the last of their 
Components to implement their 
stolid metaphysic of hauling and 
pushing. They pushed their planet. 

They knew where to push it. 

Each Pyramid as it stood was 
a radio-astronomy observatory, 
powerful and accurate beyond the 
wildest dreams of Earthly radio- 
astronomers. From this start, they 
built instruments to aid their 
naked senses. They went into a 
kind of hibernation, reducing their 
activity to a bare trickle except for 
a small “crew” and headed for 
Earth. They had every reason to 
believe they would find more Com- 
ponents there, and they did. 

Tropile was one of them. The 
only thing which set him apart 
from the others was that he was 
the most recent to be stockpiled. 

The religion, or vice, or philoso- 
phy he practiced made it possible 
for him to be a Component. Medi- 
tation derived from Zen Buddhism 
was a windfall for the Pyramids, 
though, of course, they had no idea 
at all of what lay behind it and 
did not “care.” They knew only 
that, at certain times, certain po- 

60 



tential Components became Com- 
ponents which were no longer 
merely potential— which were, in 
fact, ripe for harvesting. 

It was useful to them that the 
minds they cropped were utterly 
blank. It saved the trouble of 
blanking them. 

Tropile had been harvested at 
the moment his inhibiting con- 
scious mind had been cleared, for 
the Pyramids were not interested 
in him as an entity capable of 
will and conception. They used 
only the raw capacity of the hu- 
man brain and its perceptors. 

They used Rashevsky’s Num- 
ber, the gigantic, far more than 
astronomical expression that de- 
noted the number of switching 
operations performable within the 
human brain. They used “subcep- 
tion,” the phenomenon by which 
the reasoning mind, uninhibited 
by consciousness, reacts directly 
to stimuli— shortcutting the cere- 
bral censor, avoiding the weighing 
of shall-I-or-shan’t-I that precedes 
every conscious act. 

The harvested minds were — 
Components. 

It is not desirable that your bed- 
room wall switch have a mind of 
its own; if you turn the lights on, 
you want them on. So it was with 
the Pyramids. 

A Component was needed in 
the industrial complex which trans- 
formed catabolism products into 
anabolism products. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



'W7ITH long experience gained 
since their planetfall, Pyra- 
mids received the tabula rasa that 
was Glenn Tropile. He arrived in 
one piece, wearing a blanket of 
air. Quick-frozen mentally at the 
moment of inert blankness his 
Meditation had granted him— the 
psychic drunkard’s coma— he was 
cushioned on repellent charges as 
he plummeted down, and instant- 
ly stripped of surplus electrostatic 
charge. 

At this point, he was still hu- 
man; only asleep. 

He remained “asleep.” Annular 
fields they used for lifting and low- 
ering seized him and moved him 
into a snug tank of nutrient fluid. 
There were many such tanks, 
ready and waiting. 

The tanks themselves could be 
moved, and the one containing 
Glenn Tropile did move, to a 
metabolism complex where there 
were many other tanks, all occu- 
pied. This was a warm room— the 
Pyramids had wasted no energy 
on such foppish comforts in the 
first “room.” In this room, Glenn 
Tropile gradually resumed the ap- 
pearance of life. His heart once 
again began to beat. Faint stir- 
rings were visible in his chest as 
his habit-numbed lungs attempted 
to breathe. Gradually the stirrings 
slowed and stopped. There was no 
need for that foppish comfort, 
either; the nutrient fluid supplied 
all. 



Tropile was “wired into circuit.” 

The only literal wiring, at first, 
was a temporary one— a fine elec- 
trode aseptically introduced into 
the great nerve that leads to the 
rhinencephalon— the “small brain,” 
the area of the brain which con- 
tains the pleasure centers that mo- 
tivate human behavior. 

More than a thousand Com- 
ponents had been spoiled and dis- 
carded before the Pyramids had 
located the pleasure centers so 
exactly. 

While the Component, Tropile, 
was being “programmed,” the wire 
rewarded him with minute pulses 
that made his body glow with 
animal satisfaction when he func- 
tioned correctly. That was all there 
was to it. After a time, the wire 
was withdrawn, but by then Tro- 
pile had “learned” his entire task. 
Conditioned reflexes had been es- 
tablished. They could be counted 
on for the long and useful life of 
the Component. 

That life might be very long in- 
deed; in the nutrient tank beside 
Tropile’s, as it happened, lay a 
Component with eight legs and a 
chitinous fringe around its eyes. 
It had lain in such a tank for more 
than a hundred and twenty-five 
thousand Terrestrial years. 

T HE Component was placed in 
operation. It opened its eyes 
and saw things. The sensory nerves 
of its limbs felt things. The muscles 



WOLFBANE 



61 



of its hands and toes operated 
things. 

Where was Glenn Tropile? 

He was there, all of him, but a 
zombie-Tropile. Bereft of will, 
emptied of memories. He was a 
machine and part of a huger ma- 
chine. His sex was the sex of a 
photoelectric cell; his politics were 
those of a transistor; his ambition 
that of a mercury switch. He didn’t 
know anything about sex, or fear, 
or hope. He only knew two 
things: Input and Output. 

Input to him was a display of 
small lights on a board before his 
vacant face; and also the modula- 
tion of a loudspeaker’s liquid-borne 
hum in each ear. 

Output from him was the danc- 
ing manipulation of certain but- 
tons and keys, prompted by 
changes in Input and by nothing 
else. 

Between Input and Output, he 
lay in the tank, a human Black 
Box which was capable of Rashev- 
sky’s Number of switchings, and 
of nothing else. 

He had been programmed to ac- 
complish a specific task— to shep- 
herd a chemical called 3, 7, 12- 
trihydroxycholanic acid, present in 
the catabolic product of the Pyra- 
mids, through a succession of more 
than five hundred separate opera- 
tions until it emerged as the chemi- 
cal, which the Pyramids were able 
to metabolize, called Protoporphin 
IX. 

62 



He was not the only Component 
operating in this task; there were 
several, each with its own program. 

The acid accumulated in great 
tanks a mile from him. He knew 
its concentration, heat and pres- 
sure; he knew of all the impurities 
which would affect subsequent re- 
actions. His fingers tapped, giving 
binary-coded signals to sluice gates 
to open for so many seconds and 
then to close; for such an amount 
of solvent at such a temperature 
to flow in; for the agitators to agi- 
tate for just so long at just such a 
force. And if a trouble signal dis- 
turbed any one of the 517 major 
and minor operations, he— it?— 
was set to decide among alterna- 
tives : 

— scrap the batch in view of 
flow conditions along the line? 

— isolate and bypass the batch 
through a standby loop? 

— immediate action to correct 
the malfunction? 

Without inhibiting intelligence, 
without the trammels of humanity 
on him, the intricate display board 
and the complex modulations of 
the two sound signals could be in- 
stantly taken in, evaluated and 
given their share in the decision. 

Was it— he?— still alive? 

The question has no meaning. 
It was working. It was an excellent 
machine, in fact, and the Pyramids 
cared for it well. Its only con- 
sciousness, apart from the reflexive 
responses that were its program, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was— well, call it “the sound of 
one hand alone.” Which is to say 
zero, mindlessness, Samadhi, stu- 
por. 

It continued to function for 
some time— until the required sup- 
ply of Protoporphin IX had been 
exceeded by a sufficient factor of 
safety to make further processing 
unnecessary — that is, for some 
minutes or months. During that 
time, it was Happy. (It had been 
programmed to be Happy when 
there were no uncorrected mal- 
functions of the process.) At the 
end of that time, it shut itself off, 
sent out a signal that the task was 
completed, then it was laid aside 
in the analogue of a deep-freeze, 
to be reprogrammed when another 
Component was needed. 

It was totally immaterial to the 
Pyramids that this particular Com- 
ponent had not been stamped from 
Citizen but from Wolf. 

IX 

D OGET Germyn, of Wheeling 
-* *- a Citizen, contemplated his 
wife with growing concern. 

Possibly the events of the past 
few days had unhinged her reason, 
but he was nearly sure that she 
had eaten a portion of the evening 
meal secretly, in the serving room, 
before calling him to the table. 

He felt positive that it was only 
a temporary aberration; she was, 
after all, a Citizeness, with all that 



that implied. A— a creature— like 
that Gala Tropile, for example— 
someone like that might steal 
extra portions with craft and guile. 
You couldn’t live with a Wolf for 
years and not have some of it rub 
off on you. But not Citizeness 
Germyn. 

There was a light, thrice-re- 
peated tap on the door. 

Speak of the devil, thought 
Roget Germyn most appropriate- 
ly; for it was that same Gala Tro- 
pile. She entered, her head down- 
cast, looking worn and— well, pretty. 

He began formally: “I give you 
greeting, Citi— ” 

“They’re here!” she interrupted 
in desperate haste. Germyn 
blinked. “Please,” she begged, 
“can’t you do something? They’re 
Wolves!” 

Citizeness Germyn emitted a 
muted shriek. 

“You may leave, Citizeness,” 
Germyn told her shortly, already 
forming in his mind the words of 
gentle reproof he would later use. 
“Now what is all this talk of 
Wolves?” 

Gala Tropile distractedly sat in 
the chair her hostess had vacated. 
“We were running away,” she 
babbled. “Glenn— he was Wolf, you 
see, and he made me leave with 
him, after the House of the Five 
Regulations. We were a day’s 
long march from Wheeling and 
we stopped to rest. And there was 
an aircraft, Citizen!” 



WOLFBANE 



63 



“An aircraft!” Citizen Germyn 
allowed himself a frown. “Citizen- 
ess, it is not well to invent things 
which are not so.” 

“I saw it, Citizen! There were 
men in it. One of them is here 
again! He came looking for me 
with another man and I barely es- 
caped him. I’m afraid!” 

“There is no cause for fear, only 
an opportunity to appreciate,” Citi- 
zen Germyn said mechanically— 
it was what one told one’s chil- 
dren. 

But within himself, he was find- 
ing it very hard to remain calm. 
That word Wolf— it was a destroy- 
er of calm, an incitement to panic 
and hatred! He remembered Tro- 
pile well, and there was Wolf, to 
be sure. The mere fact that Citi- 
zen Germyn had doubted his 
Wolfishness at first was powerful 
cause to be doubly convinced of 
it now; he had postponed the day 
of reckoning for an enemy of all 
the world, and there was enough 
secret guilt in his recollection to 
set his own heart thumping. 

“Tell me exactly what hap- 
pened,” said Citizen Germyn, in 
words that the stress of emotion 
had already made far less than 
graceful. 

Obediently, Gala Tropile said: 
“I was returning to my home after 
the evening meal and Citizeness 
Puffin— she took me in after Citi- 
zen Tropile — after my husband 
was—” 

64 



“I understand. You made your 
home with her.” 

“Yes. She told me that two men 
had come to see me. They spoke 
badly, she said, and I was alarmed. 
I peered through a window of my 
home and they were there. One 
had been in the aircraft I saw! 
And they flew away with my hus- 
band.” 

“It is a matter of seriousness,” 
Citizen Germyn admitted doubt- 
fully. “So then you came here to 
me?” 

“Yes, but they saw me, Citi- 
zen! And I think they followed. 
You must protect me— I have no 
one else!” 

“If they be Wolf,” Germyn said 
calmly, “we will raise hue and cry 
against them. Now will the Citi- 
zeness remain here? I go forth to 
see these men.” 

There was a graceless hammer- 
ing on the door. 

“Too late!” cried Gala Tropile 
in panic. “They are here!” 

/^ITIZEN Germyn went through 
^ the ritual of greeting, of depre 
eating the ugliness and poverty of 
his home, of offering every! hing 
he owned to his visitors; it was the 
way to greet a stranger. 

The two men lacked both com 
tesy and wit, but they did make 
an attempt to comply with the 
minimal formal customs of intro- 
duction. He had to give them 
credit for that; and yet it was al- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



most more alarming than if they 
had blustered and yelled. 

For he knew one of these men. 

He dredged the name out of 
his memory. It was Haendl. The 
same man had appeared in Wheel- 
ing the day Glenn Tropile had 
been scheduled to make the Do- 
nation of the Spinal Tap— and had 
broken free and escaped. He had 
inquired about Tropile of a good 
many people, Citizen Germyn in- 
cluded, and even at that time, in 
the excitement of an Amok, a 
Wolf-finding and a Translation in 
a single day, Germyn had won- 
dered at Haendl’s lack of breed- 
ing and airs. 

Now he wondered no longer. 

But the man made no overt act 
and Citizen Germyn postponed 
the raising of the hue and cry. It 
was not a thing to be done lightly. 

“Gala Tropile is in this house,” 
the man with Haendl said bluntly. 

Citizen Germyn managed a 
Quirked Smile. 

“We want to see her, Germyn. 
It’s about her husband. He— uh— 
he was with us for a while and 
something happened.” 

“Ah, yes. The Wolf.” 

The man flushed and looked at 
Haendl. Haendl said loudly: “The 
Wolf. Sure he’s a Wolf. But he’s 
gone now, so you don’t have to 
worry about that.” 

“Gone?” 

“Not just him, but four or five 
of us. There was a man named 



Innison and he’s gone, too. We * 
need help, Germyn. Something 
about Tropile— God knows how it 
is, but he started something. We 
want to talk to his wife and find 
out what we can about him. So 
will you get her out of the back 
room where she’s hiding and bring 
her here, please?” 

Citizen Germyn quivered. He 
bent over the ID bracelet that 
once had belonged to the one PFC 
Joe Hartman, fingering it to hide 
his thoughts. 

He said at last: “Perhaps you 
are right. Perhaps the Citizeness 
is with my wife. If this be so, 
would it not be possible that she 
is fearful of those who once were 
with her husband?” 

TTAENDL laughed sourly. “She 
isn’t any more fearful than 
we are, Germyn. I told you about 
this man Innison who disappeared. 
He was a Son of the Wolf, you 
understand me? For that matter—” 
He glanced at his companion, 
licked his lips and changed his 
mind about what he had been go- 
ing to say next. “He was a Wolf. 
Do you ever remember hearing of 
a Wolf being Translated before?” 

“Translated?” Germyn dropped 
the ID bracelet. “But that’s im- 
possible!” he cried, forgetting his 
manners completely. “Oh, no! 
Translation comes only to those 
who attain the moment of supreme 
detachment, you can be sure of 



WOLFBANE 



65 



that. I know! I’ve seen it with my 
own eyes. No Wolf could pos- 
silly— ” 

“At least five Wolves did,” 
Haendl said grimly. “Now you see 
what the trouble is? Tropile was 
Translated — I saw that with my 
own eyes. The next day, Innison. 
Within a week, two or three others. 
So we came down here, Germyn, 
not because we like you people, 
not because we enjoy it, but be- 
cause we’re scared. 

“What we want is to talk to 
Tropile’s wife— you, too, I guess; 
we want to talk to anybody who 
ever knew him. We want to find 
out everything there is to find out 
about Tropile and see if we can 
make any sense of the answers. 
Because maybe Translation is the 
supreme objective of life to you 
people, Germyn, but to us it’s just 
one more way of dying. And we 
don’t want to die.” 

Citizen Germyn bent to pick up 
his cherished identification brace- 
let and dropped it absently on a 
table. There was very much on 
his mind. 

He said at last: “That is strange. 
Shall I tell you another strange 
thing?” 

Haendl, looking angry and baf- 
fled, nodded. 

Germyn said: “There has been 
no Translation here since the day 
the Wolf, Tropile, escaped. But 
there have been Eyes. I have seen 
them myself. It—” He hesitated, 

66 



shrugged. “It has been disturbing. 
Some of our finest Citizens have 
ceased to Meditate; they have 
been worrying. So many Eyes and. 
nobody taken! It is outside of all 
of our experience, and our customs 
have suffered. Politeness is dwin- 
dling among us. Even in my own 
household—” 

He coughed and went on: “No 
matter. But these Eyes have come 
into every home; they have peered 
about, peered about, and no one 
has been taken. Why? Is it some- 
thing to do with the Translation 
of Wolves?” He stared hopeless- 
ly at his visitors. “All I know is 
that it is very strange and there- 
fore I am worried.” 

“Then take us to Gala Tropile,” 
said Haendl. “Let’s see what we 
can find out!” 

Citizen Germyn bowed. He 
cleared his throat and raised his 
voice just sufficiently to carry from 
one room to another. “Citizeness!” 
he called. 

There was a pause and then his 
wife appeared in the doorway, 
looking ruffled and ill at ease with 
her guest. 

“Will you ask if Citizeness Tro- 
pile will join us here?” he re- 
quested. 

His wife nodded. “She is resting. 
I will call her.” 

They called her and questioned 
her for some time. 

She told them nothing. 

She had nothing to tell. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



X 

/"iN Earth’s binary, Glenn Tro- 
pile had been reprogrammed 
for a new task. 

The problem was navigation. 
Earth had been a disappointment 
to the Pyramids; it was necessary 
to move rapidly to a more reward- 
ing planet. 

The Pyramids had taken Earth 
out past Pluto’s orbit with a simple 
shove, slow and massive. It had 
been enough merely to approxi- 
mate the direction in which they 
would want to go. There would be 
plenty of time for refinements of 
course later. 

But now the time for refine- 
ments had come, earlier than they 
might have expected. They had 
now time to travel, they knew 
where to— a star cluster reason- 
ably sure to be rich in Componen- 
tiferous planets. It was inherent in 
the nature of Component mines 
that eventually they always played 
out. 

There were always more mines, 
though. If that had not been so, 
it would have been necessary, per- 
haps, to stock-breed Components 
against future needs. But it was 
easier to work the vein out and 
move on. 

Now the course had to be com- 
puted. There were such variables 
to be considered as: motion of the 
star cluster; acceleration of the 
binary-planet system; gravitational 



influence of every astronomical ob- 
ject in the island universe, with- 
out exception. 

Precise computation on this 
basis was obviously not practical. 
That was not an answer to the 
problem, since the time required 
would approach eternity as one of 
its parameters. 

It was possible to simplify the 
problem. Only the astronomical 
bodies which were relatively near- 
by need be treated as individuals. 
Farther away, the Pyramids be- 
gan to group them in small 
bunches, still farther in large 
bunches, on to the point where 
the farthest — and the most nu- 
merous-bodies were lumped to- 
gether as a vague gravitational 
“noise” whose average intensity 
alone it was required to know and 
to enter as a datum. 

And still no single Component 
could handle even its own share 
of the problem, were the “com- 
puter” they formed to be kept 
within the range of permissible 
size. 

It was for this that the Com- 
ponent which had once been Tro- 
pile was taken out of storage. 

This was all old stuff to the 
Pyramids; they knew how to 
handle it. They broke the problem 
down to its essentials, separated 
even those into many parts. There 
was, for example, the subsection 
of one certain aspect of the logis- 
tical problem which involved lo- 



WOLFBANE 



67 



eating and procuring additional 
Components to handle the load. 

Even that tiny specialization 
was too much for a single Com- 
ponent, but fortunately the Pyra- 
mids had resources to bring to 
bear. The procedure in such cases 
was to hitch several Components 
together. 

This was done. 

When the Pyramids finished 
their neuro-surgery, there floated 
in an oversized nutrient tank a 
thing like a great sea-anemone. 
It was composed of eight Com- 
ponents— all human, as it happened 
—arranged in a circle, facing in- 
ward, joined temple to temple, 
brain to brain. 

At their feet, where sixteen eyes 
could see it, was the display board 
to feed them their Input. Sixteen 
hands each grasped a molded 
switch to handle their binary-coded 
Output. There would be no storage 
of the Output outside of the eight- 
Component complex itself; it went 
as control signals to the electro- 
static generators, funneled through 
the single Pyramid on Mount 
Everest, which handled the task 
of Component-procurement. 

That is, of Translation. 

The programming was slow and 
thorough. Perhaps the Pyramid 
which finally activated the octuple 
unit and went away was pleased 
with itself, not knowing that one 
of its Components was Glenn Tro- 
pile. 

68 



N IRVANA. (It pervaded all; 

there was nothing outside of 
it.) 

Nirvana. (Glenn Tropile floated 
in it as in the amniotic fluid around 
him.) 

Nirvana. (The sound of one 
hand . Floating oneness.) 
There was an intrusion. 
Perfection is completed; by add- 
ing to it, it is destroyed. Duality 
struck like a thunderbolt. Oneness 
shattered. 

For Glenn Tropile, it seemed as 
though his wife were screaming 
at him to wake up. He tried to. 

It was curiously difficult and 
painful. Timeless poignant sadness, 
five years of sorrow over a lost 
love compressed into a microsec- 
ond. It was always so, Tropile 
thought drowsily, awakening. It 
never lasts. What’s the use of wor- 
rying over what always hap- 
pens . 

Sudden shock and horror rocked 
him. 

This was no ordinary awaken- 
ing— no ordinary thing at all- 
nothing was as it ever had been 
before! 

Tropile opened his mouth and 
screamed— or thought he did. But 
there was only a hoarse, faint flut- 
ter in his eardrums. 

It was a moment when sanity 
might have gone. But there was 
one curious, mundane fact that 
saved him. He was holding some- 
thing in his hands. He found that 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he could look at it, and it was a 
switch. A molded switch, mounted 
on a board, and he was holding one 
in each hand. 

It was little to cling to, but it 
at least was real. If his hands could 
be holding something, then there 
must be some reality somewhere. 

Tropile closed his eyes and 
managed to open them again. Yes, 
there was reality, too. He closed 
his eyes and light stopped. He 
opened them and light returned. 

Then perhaps he was not dead, 
as he had thought. 

Carefully, stumbling— his mind 
his only usable tool— he tried to 
make an estimate of his surround- 
ings. 

He could hardly believe what 
he found. 

Item: he could scarcely move. 
Somehow he was bound by his 
feet and his head. How? He 
couldn’t tell. 

Item: he was bent over and he 
couldn’t straighten. Why? Again 
he couldn’t tell, but it was a fact. 
The great erecting muscles of his 
back answered his command, but 
his body would not move. 

Item: his eyes saw, but only in 
a small area. 

He couldn’t move his head, 
either. Still, he could see a few 
things. The switch in his hand, his 
feet, a sort of display of lights on 
a strangely circular board. 

The lights flickered and changed 
their pattern. 



YfTlTHOUT thinking, he moved 
a switch. Why? Because it 
was right to move that switch. 
When a certain light flared green, 
a certain switch had to be thrown. 
Why? Well, when a certain light 
flared green, a certain switch— 

He abandoned that problem. 
Never mind why; what the devil 
was going on? 

Glenn Tropile squinted about 
him like a mollusc peering out of 
its shell. There was another fact, 
the oddness of the seeing. What 
makes it look so queer, he asked 
himself. 

He found an answer, but it re- 
quired some time to take it in. 
He was seeing in a strange per- 
spective. One looks out of two 
eyes. Close one eye and the world 
is flat. Open it again and there is 
a stereoscopic double; the salien- 
cies of the picture leap forward, 
the background retreats. 

So with the lights on the board 
—no, not exactly; but something 
like that, he thought. It was as 
though— he squinted and strained 
—well, as though he had never real- 
ly seen before. As though for all 
his life he had had only one eye, 
and now he had strangely been 
given two. 

His visual perception of the 
board was total. He could see all 
of it at once. It had no “front” or 
“back.” It was in the round. The 
natural thinking of it was without 
orientation. He engulfed and com- 



WOLFBANE 



69 



prehended it as a unit. It had no 
secrets of shadow or silhouette. 

I think, Tropile mouthed slow- 
ly to himself, that I’m going crazy. 

But that was no explanation, 
either. Mere insanity didn’t ac- 
count for what he saw. 

Then, he asked himself, was he 
in a state that was beyond Nir- 
vana? He remembered, with- an 
odd flash of guilt, that he had been 
Meditating, watching the stages 
of boiling water. All right, per- 
haps he had been Translated. But 
what was this, then? Were the 
Meditators wrong in teaching that 
Nirvana was the end— and yet 
righter than the Wolves, who dis- 
missed Meditation as a phe- 
nomenon wholly inside the skull 
and refused to discuss Translation 
at all? 

That was a question for which 
he could find nothing approaching 
an answer. He turned away from 
it and looked at his hands. 

He could see them, too, in the 
round, he noted. He could see 
every wrinkle and pore in all six- 
teen of them . 

Sixteen hands! 

' I ' HAT was the other moment 
when sanity might have gone. 
He closed his eyes. (Sixteen eyes! 
No wonder the total perception!) 
And, after a while, he opened them 
again. 

The hands, were there. All six- 
teen of them. 



Cautiously, Tropile selected a 
finger that seemed familiar in 
his memory. After a moment’s 
thought, he flexed it. It bent. He 
selected another. Another— on a 
different hand this time. 

He could use any or all of the 
sixteen hands. They were all his, 
all sixteen of them. 

I appear, thought Tropile crazi- 
ly, to be a sort of eight-branched 
snowflake. Each of my branches 
is a human body. 

He stirred, and added another 
datum: I appear also to be in a 
tank of fluid and yet I do not 
drown. 

There were certain deductions 
to be made from that. Either 
someone — the Pyramids? — had 
done something to his lungs, or 
else the fluid was as good an oxy- 
genating medium as air. Or both. 

Suddenly a burst of data-lights 
twinkled on the board below him. 
Instantly and involuntarily, his 
sixteen hands began working the 
switches, transmitting complex di- 
rections in a lightninglike stream of 
on-off clicks. 

Tropile relaxed and let it hap- 
pen. He had no choice; the power 
that made it right to respond to 
the board made it impossible for 
his brain to concentrate while the 
response was going on. Perhaps, he 
thought drowsily, he would never 
have awakened at all if it had 
not been for the long period with 
no lights .

But he was awake. And his con- 
sciousness began to explore as the 
task ended. 

He had had an opportunity to 
understand something of what was 
happening. He understood that he 
was now a part of something larger 
than himself, beyond doubt some- 
thing which served and belonged 
to the Pyramids. His single brain 
not being large enough for the 
job, seven others had been hooked 
in with it. 

But where were their personali- 
ties? 

Gone, he supposed; presumably 
they had been Citizens. Sons of 
the Wolf did not Meditate and 
therefore were not Translated— ex- 
cept for himself, he corrected wry- 
ly, remembering the Meditation on 
Rainclouds that had led him to— 

No, wait! 

Not Rainclouds but Water! 

HPROPILE caught hold of him- 
self and forced his mind to re- 
trace that thought. He remem- 
bered the Raincloud Meditation. 
It had been prompted by a par- 
ticularly noble cumulus of the An- 
cient Ship type. 

And this was odd. Tropile had 
never been deeply interested in 
Rainclouds, had never known even 
the secondary classifications of 
Raincloud types. And he knew 
that the Ancient Ship was of the 
fourth order of categories. 

It was a false memory. 



It was not his. , 

Therefore, logically, it was 
someone else’s memory; and being 
available to his own mind, as the 
fourteen other hands and eyes 
were available, it must belong to 
—another branch of the snowflake. 

He turned his eyes down and 
tried to see which of the branches 
was his old body. He found it 
quickly, with growing excitement. 
There was the left great toe of 
his body. He had injured it in 
boyhood and there was no mistak- 
ing the way it was bent. Good! It 
was reassuring. 

He tried to feel the one particu- 
lar body that led to that familiar 
toe. 

He succeeded, though not easily. 
After a time, he became more 
aware of that body— somewhat as 
conscious” or “heart conscious.” 
a neurotic may become “stomach 
But this was no neurosis; it was 
an intentional exploration. 

Since that worked, with some 
uneasiness he transferred his at- 
tention to another pair of feet and 
“thought” his way up from them. 

It was embarrassing. 

For the first time in his life, 
he knew what it felt like to have 
breasts. For the first time in his 
life, he knew what it was like to 
have one’s internal organs quite 
differently shaped and arranged, 
buttressed and stressed by dif- 
ferent muscles. The very faint 
background feel of man’s internal 



WOLFBANE 



71 



arrangements, never questioned 
unless something goes wrong with 
them and they start to hurt, was 
not at all like the faint background 
feel that a woman has inside her. 

And when he concentrated on 
that feel, it was no faint back- 
ground to him. It was surprising 
and upsetting. 

He withdrew his attention— hop- 
ing that he would be able to. 
Gratefully, he became conscious of 
his own body again. He was still 
himself if he chose to be. 

Were the other seven still them- 
selves? 

He reached into his mind— all of 
it, all eight separate intelligences 
that were combined within him. 

“Is anybody there?” he de- 
manded. 

No answer— or nothing he could 
recognize as an answer. He drove 
harder and there still was none. 
It was annoying. He resented it 
as bitterly, he remembered, as in 
the old days when he had first 
been learning the subtleties of Ruin 
Appreciation. There had been a 
Ruin Master, his name forgotten, 
who had been sometimes less than 
courteous, had driven hard— 

Another false memory! 

He withdrew and weighed it. 
Perhaps, he thought, that was a 
part of the answer. These people, 
these other seven, would not be 
driven. The attempt to call them 
back to consciousness would have 
to be delicate. When he drove 

72 



hard, it was painful — he remem- 
bered the instant violent agony of 
his own awakening — and they re- 
acted with anguish. 

1VT ORE gently, alert for vagrant 
“memories,” he combed the 
depths of the eightfold mind within 
him, reaching into the sleeping por- 
tions, touching, handling, sifting 
and associating, sorting. This mem- 
ory of an old knife wound from 
an Amok— that was not the Rain- 
cloud woman; it was a man, very 
aged. This faint recollection of a 
childhood fear of drowning— was 
that she? It was; it fitted with this 
other recollection, the long detour 
on the road south toward the sun, 
around a river. 

The Raincloud woman was the 
first to round out in his mind, and 
the first he communicated with. 
He was not surprised to find that, 
early in her life, she had feared 
that she might be Wolf. 

He reached out for her. It was 
almost magic— knowing the “secret 
name” of a person, so that then he 
was yours to command. But the 
“secret name” was more than that. 
It was the gestalt of the person. 
It was the sum of all data and ex- 
perience, never available to an- 
other person— until now. 

With her memories arranged at 
last in his own mind, he thouhgt 
persuasively: “Citizeness Alla Na- 
rova, will you awaken and speak 
with me?” 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



No answer — only a vague, 
troubled stirring. 

Gently he persisted: “I know 
you well, Alla Narova. You some- 
times thought you might be a 
Daughter of the Wolf, but never 
really believed it because you 
knew you loved your husband— 
and thought Wolves did not love, 
you loved Rainclouds, too. It was 
when you stood at Beachy Head 
and saw a great cumulus that you 
went into Meditation—” 

And on and on, many times, 
coaxingly. Even so, it was not easy; 
but at last he began to reach her. 
Slowly she began to surface. 
Thoughts faintly sounded in his 
mind, like echoes at first, his own 
thoughts bouncing back at him, 
a sort of mental nod of agree- 
ment: “Yes, that is so.” Then- 
terror. With a shaking fear, a hys- 
terical rush, Citizeness Alla Na- 
rova came violently up to full con- 
sciousness and to panic. 

She was soundlessly screaming. 
The whole eight-branched figure 
quivered and twisted in its nutrient 
bath. 

The terrible storm raged in Tro- 
pile’s own mind as fully as in hers 
—but he had the advantage of 
knowing what it was. He helped 
her. He fought it for the two of 
them . soothing, explaining, 
calming. 

At last her branch of the snow- 
flake-body retreated, sobbing for a 
spell. The storm was over. 



He talked to her in his mind 
and she “listened.” She was in- 
credulous, but there was no choice 
for her; she had to believe. 

Exhausted and passive, she 
asked finally: “What can we do? 
I wish I were dead!” 

He told her: “You were never 
a coward before. Remember, Alla 
Narova, I know you as nobody has 
ever known another human being 
before. That’s the way you will 
know me. As for what we can do 
—we must begin by waking the 
others, if we can.” 

“If not?” 

“If not,” Tropile replied grim- 
ly, “then we will think of some- 
thing else.” 

She was of tough stuff, he 
thought admiringly. When she had 
rested and absorbed things, her 
spirit was almost that of a Wolf; 
she had very nearly been right 
about herself. 

Together they explored their 
twinned members. They found 
through them exactly what task 
was theirs to do. They found how 
the electrostatic harvesting scythe 
of the Pyramids was controlled, 
by and through them. They found 
what limitations there were and 
what freedoms they owned. They 
reached into the other petals of 
the snowflake, reached past the 
linked Components into the whole 
complex of electrostatic field gen- 
erators and propulsion machinery, 
reached even past that into —

Into the great single function of 
the Pyramids that lay beyond. 

XI 

TT AENDL was on the ragged 
edge of breakdown, which 
was something new in his life. 

It was full hot summer and the 
hidden colony of Wolves in Prince- 
ton should have been full of energy 
and life. The crops were growing 
on all the fields nearby; the 
drained storehouses were being re- 
plenished. 

The aircraft that had been so 
painfully rebuilt and fitted for the 
assault on Mount Everest were 
standing by, ready to be manned 
and to take off. 

And nothing, absolutely nothing, 
was going right. 

It looked as though there would 
be no expedition to Everest. Four 
times now, Haendl had gathered 
his forces and been all ready. Four 
times, a key man of the expedition 
had— vanished. 

Wolves didn’t vanish! 

And yet more than a score of 
them had. First Tropile— then In- 
nison— then two dozen more, by 
ones and twos. No one was im- 
mune. Take Innison, for example. 
There was a man who was Wolf 
through and through. He was a 
doer, not a thinker; his skills were 
the skills of an artisan, a tinkerer, 
a jackleg mechanic. How could a 
man like that succumb to the pal- 

74 



lid lure of Meditation? 

But undeniably he had. 

It had reached a point where 
Haendl himself was red-eyed and 
jumpy. He had set curious alarms 
for himself — had enlisted the help 
of others of the colony to avert 
the danger of Translation from 
himself. 

When he went to bed at night, a 
lieutenant sat next to his bed, 
watchfully alert lest Haendl, in 
that moment of reverie before 
sleep, fell into Meditation and 
himself be Translated. There was 
no hour of the day when Haendl 
permitted himself to be alone; and 
his companions, or guards, were 
ordered to shake him awake, as 
violently as need be, at the first 
hint of an abstracted look in the 
eyes or a reflective cast of the 
features. 

As time went on, Haendl’s self- 
imposed regime of constant alert- 
ness began to cost him heavily in 
lost rest and sleep. And the con- 
sequences of that were— more and 
more occasions when the body- 
guards shook him awake; less and 
less rest. 

He was very close to breakdown 
indeed. 

On a hot, wet morning a few 
days after his useless expedition to 
see Citizen Germyn in Wheeling, 
Haendl ate a tasteless breakfast 
and, reeling with fatigue, set out 
on a tour of inspection of Prince- 
ton. Warm rain dripped from low 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



clouds, but that was merely one 
more annoyance to Haendl. He 
hardly noticed it. 

There were upward of a thou- 
sand Wolves in the Community 
and there were signs of worry on 
the face of every one of them. 
Haendl was not the only man in 
Princeton who had begun laying 
traps for himself as a result of 
the unprecedented disappearances; 
he was not the only one who was 
short of sleep. When one member 
in forty disappears, the morale of 
the whole community receives a 
shattering blow. 

To Haendl, it was clear, look- 
ing into the faces of his com- 
patriots, that not only was it go- 
ing to be nearly impossible to 
mount the planned assault on the 
Pyramid on Everest this year, it 
was going to be unbearably diffi- 
cult merely to keep the community 
going. 

The whole Wolf pack was on 
the verge of panic. 

r 1 1 HERE was a confused shout- 
ing behind Haendl. Groggily 
he turned and looked; half a dozen 
Wolves were yelling and pointing 
at something in the wet, muggy 
air. 

It was an Eye, hanging silent 
and featureless over the center of 
the street. 

Haendl took a deep breath and 
mustered command of himself. 
“Frampton!” he ordered one of his 



lieutenants. “Get the helicopter 
with the instruments here. We’ll 
take some more readings.” 

Frampton opened his mouth, 
then looked more closely at 
Haendl and, instead, began to talk 
on his pocket radio. Haendl knew 
what was in the man’s mind— it 
was in his own, too. 

What was the use of more read- 
ings? From the time of Tropile’s 
Translation on, they had had a 
superfluity of instrument readings 
on the forces and auras that sur- 
rounded the Eyes— yes, and on 
Translations themselves, too. Be- 
fore Tropile, there had never been 
an Eye seen in Princeton, much 
less an actual Translation. But 
things were different now. Every- 
thing was different. Eyes roamed 
restlessly around day and night. 

Some of the men nearest the 
Eye were picking up rocks and 
throwing them at the bobbing vor- 
tex in the air. Haendl started to 
yell at them to stop, then changed 
his mind. The Eye didn’t seem to 
be affected— as he watched, one of 
the men scored a direct hit with 
a cobblestone. The stone went 
right through the Eye, without 
sound or effect; why not let them 
work off some of their fears in 
direct action? 

There was a fluttering of vanes 
and the copter with the instru- 
ments mounted on it came down 
in the middle of the street, be- 
tween Haendl and the Eye. 



WOLFBANE 



75 



It was all very rapid from then 
on. 

The Eye swooped toward 
Haendl. He couldn’t help it; he 
ducked. That was useless, but it 
was also unnecessary, for he saw 
in a second that it was only part- 
ly the motion of the Eye toward 
him that made it loom larger; it 
was also that the Eye itself was 
growing. 

An Eye was perhaps the size of 
a football, as near as anyone could 
judge. This one got bigger, bigger. 
It was the size of a roc’s egg, the 
size of a whale’s blunt head. It 
stopped and hovered over the heli- 
copter, while the man inside fran- 
tically pointed lenses and meters— 

Thundercrash. 

Not a man this time— Transla- 
tion had gone beyond men. The 
whole helicopter vanished, man, 
instruments, spinning vanes and 
all. 

Haendl picked himself up, 
sweating, shocked beyond sleepi- 
ness. 

The young man named Framp- 
ton said fearfully: “Haendl, what 
do we do now?” 

“Do?” Haendl stared at him ab- 
sently. “Why, kill ourselves, I 
guess.” 

He nodded soberly, as though 
he had at last attained the solu- 
tion of a difficult problem. Then 
he sighed. 

“Well, one thing before that,” he 
said. “I’m going to Wheeling. We 

76 



Wolves are licked; maybe the Citi- 
zens can help us now.” 

T) OGET Germyn, of Wheeling, 
a Citizen, received the mes- 
sage in the chambers that served 
him as a place of business. He had 
a visitor waiting for him at home. 

Germyn was still Citizen and he 
could not quickly break off the 
pleasant and interminable discus- 
sion he was having with a pros- 
pective client over a potential busi- 
ness arrangement. He apologized 
for the interruption caused by the 
message the conventional five 
times, listened while his guest ex- 
plained once more the plan he had 
come to propose in full, then 
turned his cupped hands toward 
himself in the gesture of Denial of 
Adequacy. It was the closest he 
could come to saying no. 

On the other side of the desk, 
the Citizen who had come to pro- 
pose an investment scheme imme- 
diately changed the subject by in- 
viting Germyn and his Citizeness 
to a Sirius Viewing, the invitation 
in the form of rhymed couplets. 
He had wanted to transact his 
business very much, but he 
couldn’t insist. 

Germyn got out of the invita- 
tion by a Conditional Acceptance 
in proper form, and the man left, 
delayed only slightly by the Four 
Urgings to Stay. Almost imme- 
diately, Germyn dismissed his 
clerk and closed his office for the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



day by tying a triple knot in a 
length of red cord across the open 
door. 

When he got to his home, he 
found, as he had suspected, that 
the visitor was Haendl. 

There was much doubt in Citi- 
zen Germyn’s mind about Haendl. 
The man had nearly admitted to 
being Wolf, and how could a citi- 
zen overlook that? But in the ex- 
citement of Gala Tropile’s Trans- 
lation, there had been no hue and 
cry. Germyn had permitted the 
man to leave. And now? 

He reserved judgment. He 
found Haendl distastefully sipping 
tea in the living room and attempt- 
ing to keep up a formal conversa- 
tion with Citizeness Germyn. He 
rescued him, took him aside, closed 
a door— and waited. 

He was astonished at the change 
in the man. Before, Haendl had 
been bouncy, aggressive, quick- 
moving— the very qualities least 
desired in a Citizen, the mark of 
the Son of the Wolf. Now he was 
none of these things, but he looked 
no more like a Citizen for all that; 
he has haggard, tense. 

He said, with an absolute mini- 
mum of protocol: “Germyn, the 
last time I saw you, there was a 
Translation. Gala Tropile, remem- 
ber?” 

“I remember,” Citizen Germyn 
said. Remember! It had hardly left 
his thoughts. 

“And you told me there had 



been others. Are they still gqjng 
on?” 

^ ERMYN said: “There have 
been others.” He was trying to 
speak directly, to match this man 
Haendl’s speed and forcefulness. 
It was hardly good manners, but it 
had occurred to Citizen Germyn 
that there were times when man- 
ners, after all, were not the most 
important thing in the world. 
“There were two in the past few 
days. One was a woman— Citizen- 
ess Baird; her husband’s a teacher. 
She was Viewing Through Glass 
with four or five other women at 
the time. She just— disappeared. 
She was looking through a green 
prism at the time, if that helps.” 
“I don’t know if it helps or not. 
Who was the other one?” 

Germyn shrugged. “A man 
named Harmane. No one saw it. 
But they heard the thunderclap, 
or something like a thunderclap, 
and he was missing.” He thought 
for a moment. “It is a little un- 
usual, I suppose. Two in a week—” 
Haendl said roughly: “Listen, 
Germyn. It isn’t just two. In the 
past thirty days, within the area 
around here and in one other 
place, there have been at least fif- 
ty. In two places, do you under- 
stand? Here and in Princeton. The 
rest of the world— nothing much; 
a few Translations here and there. 
But just in these two communi- 
ties, fifty. Does that make sense?” 



WOLFBANE 



77 



Citizen Germyn thought. “—No.” 
“No. And I’ll tell you some- 
thing else. Three of the— well, vic- 
tims have been children under the 
age of five. One was too young to 
walk. And the most recent Trans- 
lation wasn’t a person at all. It was 
a helicopter. Now figure that out, 
Germyn. What’s the explanation 
for Translations?” 

Germyn was gaping. “Why— you 
Meditate, you know. On Connec- 
tivity. The idea is that once you’ve 
grasped the Essential Connectivity 
of All Things, you become One 
with the Cosmic Whole. But I 
don’t see how a baby or a ma- 
chine—” 

“No, of course you don’t. Re- 
member Glenn Tropile?” 
“Naturally.” 

“He’s the link,” Haendl said 
grimly. “When he got Translated, 
we thought it was a big help, be- 
cause he had the consideration to 
do it right under our eyes. We got 
enough readings to give us a clue 
as to what, physically speaking, 
Translation is all about. That was 
the first real clue and we thought 
he’d done us a favor. Now I’m not 
so sure.” 

He leaned forward. “Every per- 
son I know of who was Trans- 
lated was someone Tropile knew. 
The three kids were in his class 
at the nursery school— we put him 
there for a while to keep him busy, 
when he first came to us. Two of 
the men he bunked with are gone; 

78 



the mess boy who served him is 
gone; his wife is gone. Meditation? 
No, Germyn. I know most of those 
people. Not a damned one of them 
would have spent a moment Medi- 
tating on Connectivity to save his 
life. And what do you make of 
that?” 

C WALLOWING hard, Germyn 
^ said: “I just remembered. 

That man Harmane— ” 

“What about him?” 

“The one who was Translated 
last week. He also knew Tropile. 
He was the Keeper of the House 
of the Five Regulations when Tro- 
pile was there.” 

“You see? And I’ll bet the wo- 
man knew Tropile, too.” Haendl 
got up fretfully, pacing around. 
“Here’s the thing, Germyn. I’m 
licked. You know what I am, don’t 
you?” 

Germyn said levelly: “I believe 
you to be Wolf.” 

“You believe right. That doesn’t 
matter any more. You don’t like 
Wolves. Well, I don’t like you. But 
this thing is too big for me to 
care about that any more. Tro- 
pile has started something hap- 
pening, and what the end of it is 
going to be, I can’t tell. But I 
know this: We’re not safe, either 
of us. Maybe you still think Trans- 
lation is a fulfillment. I don’t; it 
scares me. But it’s going to hap- 
pen to me— and to you. It’s going 
to happen to everybody who ever 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



had anything to do with Glenn 
Tropile, unless we can somehow 
stop it— and I don’t know how. 
Will you help me?” 

Germyn, trying not to tremble 
when all his buried fears screamed 
Wolf!, said honestly: “I’ll I’ll have 
to sleep on it.” 

Haendl looked at him for a mo- 
ment. Then he shrugged. Almost 
to himself, he said: “Maybe it 
doesn’t matter. Maybe we can’t do 
anything about it anyhow. All 
right. I’ll come back in the morn- 
ing, and if you’ve made up your 
mind to help, we’ll start trying to 
make plans. And if you’ve made 
up your mind the other way— well, 
I guess I’ll have to fight off a 
few Citizens. Not that I mind 
that.” 

Germyn stood up and bowed. 
He began the ritual Four Urgings. 

“Spare me that,” Haendl 
growled. “Meanwhile, Germyn, if I 
were you, I wouldn’t make any 
long-range plans. You may not 
be here to carry them out.” 
Germyn asked thoughtfully : 
“And if you were you?” 

“I’m not making any,” Haendl 
said grimly. 

/CITIZEN Germyn, feeling ut- 
'-^terly tainted with the scent of 
the Wolf in his home, tossed in 
his bed, sleepless. His eyes were 
wide open, staring at the dark 
ceiling. He could hear his wife’s 
decorous breathing from the foot 



of the bed— soft and regular, it* 
should have been lulling him to 
sleep. 

It was not. Sleep was very far 
away. 

Germyn was a brave enough 
man, as courage is measured 
among Citizens. That is to say, 
he had never been afraid, though 
it was true that there had been 
very little occasion. But he was 
afraid now. He didn’t want to be 
Translated. 

The Wolf, Haendl, had put his 
finger on it: Perhaps you still 
think Translation is a fulfillment. 
Translation —the reward of Medi- 
tation, the gift bestowed on only a 
handful of gloriously transfigured 
persons. That was one thing. But 
the sort of Translation that was 
now involved was nothing like 
that— not if it happened to chil- 
dren; not if it happened to Gala 
Tropile; not if it happened to a 
machine. 

And Glenn Tropile was in- 
volved in it. 

Germyn turned restlessly. 

If people who knew Glenn Tro- 
pile were likely to be Translated, 
and people who Meditated on 
Connectivity were likely to be 
Translated, then people who knew 
Glenn Tropile and didn’t want to 
be Translated had better not 
Meditate on Connectivity. 

It was very difficult to not think 
of Connectivity. 

Endlessly he calculated sums in 



WOLFBANE 



79 



arithmetic in his mind, recited the 
Five Regulations, composed Greet- 
ing Poems and Verses on View- 
ing. And endlessly he kept com- 
ing back to Tropile, to Transla- 
tion, to Connectivity. He didn’t 
want to be Translated. But still 
the thought had a certain lure. 
What was it like? Did it hurt? 

Well, probably not, he specu- 
lated. It was very fast, according 
to Haendl’s report— if you could 
believe what an admitted Son of 
the Wolf reported. But Germyn 
had to. 

Well, if it was fast — at that 
kind of speed, he thought, perhaps 
you would die instantly. Maybe 
Tropile was dead. Was that pos- 
sible? No, it didn’t seem so; after 
all, there was the fact of the con- 
nection between Tropile and so 
many of the recently Translated. 
What was the connection there? 
Or, generalizing, what connections 
were involved in— 

He rescued himself from the 
dread word and summoned up the 
first image that came to mind. It 
happened to be Tropile’s wife— 
Gala Tropile, who had disappeared 
herself, in this very room. 

Gala Tropile. He stuck close to 
the thought of her, a little pleased 
with himself. That was the trick 
of not thinking of Connectivity— 
to think so hard and fully of some- 
thing else as to leave no room in 
the mind for the unwanted 
thought. He pictured every line 

80 



of her face, every wave of her 
stringy hair . 

It was very easy that way. He 
was pleased. 

XII 

/~’|N Mount Everest, the sullen 
stream of off-and-on re- 
sponses that was “mind” to the 
Pyramid had taken note of a new 
input signal. 

It was not a critical mind. Its 
only curiosity was a restless urge 
to shove-and-haul, and there was 
no shove-and-haul about what to 
it was perhaps the analogue of a 
man’s hunger pang. The input 
signal said: Do thus. It obeyed. 

Call it craving for a new flavor. 
Where once it had patiently waited 
for the state that Citizens knew 
as Meditation on Connectivity, 
and the Pyramid itself perhaps 
knew as a stage of ripeness in the 
fruits of its wristwatch mine, now 
it wanted a different taste. Unripe? 
Overripe? At any rate, different. 

Accordingly, the high-frequency 
wheep, wheep changed in tempo 
and in key, and the bouncing 
echoes changed and . there was 
a ripe one to be plucked. (It’s 
name was Innison.) And there 
another. (Gala Tropile.) And an- 
other, another— oh, many others— 
a babe from Tropile’s nursery 
school and the Wheeling jailer and 
a woman Tropile once had coveted 
on the street. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Once the ruddy starch-to-sugar 
mark of ripeness had been what 
human beings called Meditation on 
Connectivity and the Pyramids 
knew as a convenient blankness. 
Now the sign was a sort of em- 
pathy with the Component named 
Tropile. It didn’t matter to the 
Pyramid on Mount Everest. It 
swung its electrostatic scythe and 
the— call them Tropiletropes— were 
harvested. 

It did not occur to the Pyramid 
on Mount Everest that a Com- 
ponent might be directing its ac- 
tions. How could it? 

Perhaps the Pyramid on Mount 
Everest wondered, if it knew how 
to wonder, when it noticed that 
different criteria were involved in 
selecting components these days. 
(If it knew how to “notice.” Sure- 
ly even a Pyramid might wonder 
when, without warning or explana- 
tion, its orders were changed— not 
merely to harvest a different sort 
of Component, but to drag along 
with the flesh-and-blood needful 
parts a clanking assortment of ma- 
chinery and metal, as began to 
happen. Machines? Why would 
the Pyramids need to Translate 
machines? 

But why, on the other hand, 
would a Pyramid bother to ques- 
tion a directive, even if it were 
able to? 

In any case, it didn’t. It swung 
its scythe and gathered in what 
it was caused to gather in. 



Men sometimes eat green fruit 
and come to regret it. Was it the 
same with Pyramids? 

A ND Citizen Germyn fell into 
the unsuspected trap. Avoid- 
ing Connectivity, he thought of 
Glenn Tropile— and the unfelt h-f 
pulses found him out. 

He didn’t see the Eye that 
formed above him. He didn’t feel 
the gathering of forces that formed 
his trap. He didn’t know that he 
was seized, charged, catapulted 
through space, caught, halted and 
drained. It happened too fast. 

One moment he was in his bed; 
the next moment he was— else- 
where. There wasn’t anything in 
between. 

It had happened to hundreds 
of thousands of Components be- 
fore him, but, for Citizen Germyn, 
what happened was in some ways 
different. He was not embalmed in 
nutrient fluid, formed and pro- 
grammed to take his part in the 
Pyramid-structure, for he had not 
been selected by the Pyramid but 
by that single wild Component, 
Tropile. He arrived conscious, 
awake and able to move. 

He stood up in a red-lit cham- 
ber. Vast thundering crashes of 
metal buffeted his ears. Heat 
sprang little founts of perspiration 
on his skin. 

It was too much, too much to 
take in at once. Oily-skinned mad- 
men, naked, were capering and 



WOLFBANE 



81 



shouting at him. It took him a mo- 
ment to realize that they were 
not devils; this was not Hell; he 
was not dead. 

“This way!” they were bawling 
at him. “Come on, hurry it up!” 

He reeled, following their di- 
rections, across an unpleasantly 
warm floor, staggering and falling 
—the binary planet was a quarter 
denser than Earth— until he got his 
balance. 

The capering madmen led him 
through a door— or sphincter or 
trap; it was not like anything he 
had ever seen. But it was a portal 
of a sort, and on the other side 
of it was something closer to 
sanity. It was another room, and 
though the light was still red, it 
was a paler, calmer red and the 
thundering ironmongery was a wall 
away. The madmen were naked, 
yes, but they were not mad. The 
oil on their skins was only the 
sheen of sweat. 

“Where— where am I? he gasped. 

Two voices, perhaps three or 
four, were all talking at once. He 
could make no sense of it. Citizen 
Germyn looked about him. He was 
in a sort of chamber that formed 
a part of a machine that existed 
for the unknown purposes of the 
Pyramids on the binary planet. 
And he was alive— and not even 
alone. 

He had crossed more than a mil- 
lion miles of space without feeling 
a thing. But when what the naked 

82 



men were saying began to pene- 
trate, the walls lurhced around him. 

It was true; he had been Trans- 
lated. 

He looked dazedly down at his 
own bare body, and around at the 
room, and then he realized they 
were still talking : “—when you get 
your bearings. Feel all right now? 
Come on, Citizen, snap out of it!” 

Germyn blinked. 

Another voice said peevishly: 
“Tropile’s got to find some other 
place to bring them in. That 
foundry isn’t meant for human be- 
ings. Look at the shape this one is 
in! Some time somebody’s going 
to come in and we won’t spot him 
in time and— pfut!” 

The first voice said: “Can’t be 
helped. Hey! Are you all right?” 

Citizen Germyn looked at the 
naked man in front of him and 
took a deep breath of hot, sour 
air. “Of course I’m all right,” he 
said. 

The naked man was Haendl. 

' I ''HE Tropile-petal “said” to the 
Alla Narova-petal: “Got an- 
other one! It’s Citizen Germyn!” 
The petal fluttered feebly in 
soundless laughter. 

The Alla Narova-petal “said”: 
“Glenn, come back! The whole 
propulsion-pneuma just went out 
of circuit!” 

Tropile pulled his attention 
away from his human acquisitions 
in the chamber off the foundry 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and allowed himself to fuse with 
the woman-personality. Together 
they reached out and explored 
along the pathways they had la- 
boriously traced. The propulsion- 
pneuma was the complex of navi- 
gation-computers, drive generators, 
course-vectoring units that their 
own unit had been originally part 
of —until Glenn Tropile, by waking 
its Components, had managed to 
divert it for purposes of his own. 
The two of them reached out into 
it- 

Dead end. 

It was out of circuit, as Alla 
Narova had said. One whole limb 
of their body— their new, jointly 
tenanted body, that spanned a 
whole planet and reached across 
space to Earth— had been lopped 
off. Quick, quick, they separated, 
traced separate paths. They came 
together again: Still dead end. 

The dyad that was Tropile and 
the woman reached out to touch 
the others in the snowflake and 
communicated— not in words, not 
in anything as slow and as opaque 
as words: The Pyramids have 

lopped off another circuit. The 
compound personality of the 
snowflake considered its course of 
action, reached its decision, acted. 
Quick, quick, three of the other 
members of the snowflake darted 
out of the collective unit and went 
about isolating and tracing the 
exact area that had been affected. 

Tropile: “We expected this. 



They couldn’t help noticing sooner 
or later that something was going 
wrong.” 

Alla Narova: “But, Glenn, sup- 
pose they cut us out of circuit? 
We’re stuck here. We can’t move. 
We can’t get out of the tanks. If 
they know that we are the source 
of their trouble—” 

Tropile: “Let them know! 

That’s what we’ve got the others 
here for!” He was cocky now, self- 
assured, fighting. For the first time 
in his life, he was free to fight— 
to let his Wolf blood strive to the 
utmost— and he knew what he was 
fighting for. This wasn’t a matter 
of Haendl’s pitiful tanks and car- 
bines against the invulnerable 
Pyramids; this was the invulnera- 
bility of the whole Pyramid sys- 
tem turned against the Pyramids! 

It was a warning, the fact that 
the Pyramids had become alert 
to danger, had begun cutting sec- 
tions of their planetary communi- 
cations system out of the main cir- 
cuit. But as a warning, it didn’t 
frighten Tropile; it only spurred 
him to action. 

Quick, quick, he and the woman- 
personality dissolved, sped away. 
Figuratively they sought out the 
most restive Components they 
could find, shook them by the 
shoulder, tried to wake them. Ac- 
tually— well, what is “actually?” 
The physical fact was surely that 
they didn’t move at all, for they 
were bound to their tank and to

the surgical joinings, each to each, 
at their temples. No crawling 
child in a playpen was more help- 
lessly confined than Tropile and 
Alla Narova and the others. 

And yet no human being had 
ever been more free. 

D EGARD that imbecile servant 
of Everyman, the thermostat. 

He runs the furnace in Every- 
man’s house, he measures the done- 
ness of Everyman’s breakfast 
toast, he valves the cooling fluid 
through the radiator of Every- 
man’s car. If Everyman’s house 
stays too hot or too cold, the man 
swears at the lackwit switch and 
maybe buys a new one to plug 
in. But he never, never thinks that 
his thermostat might be plotting 
against him. 

Thermostat : Man = Man : 
Pyramid. Only that and nothing 
more. It was not in the nature of 
a Pyramid to think that its Com- 
ponents, once installed, could re- 
program themselves. No Compo- 
nent ever had. (But before Glenn 
Tropile, no Component had been 
Wolf.) 

When Tropile found himself, he 
found others. They were men and 
women, real persons with gonads 
and dreams. They had been caught 
at the moment of blankness— yes; 
and frozen into that shape, true. 
But they were palimpsest person- 
alities on which the Pyramids had 
programmed their duties. Under- 

86 



neath the Pyramids’ cabalistic 
scrawl, the men and women still 
remained. They had only to be 
reached. 

Tropile and Alla Narova 
reached them— one at a time, then 
by scores. The Pyramids made 
that possible. The network of com- 
munication that they had created 
for their own purposes encom- 
passed every cell of the race and 
all its works. Tropile reached out 
from his floating snowflake and 
went where he wished— anywhere 
within the binary planet; to the 
brooding Pyramid on Earth; 
through the Eyes, wherever he 
chose on Earth’s surface. 

Physically, he was scarcely able 
to move a muscle. But, oh, the 
soaring range of his mind and 
vision! 

C ITIZEN Germyn was past 
shock, but just the same it 
was uncomfortable to be in a 
room with several dozen other per- 
sons, all of them naked. Uncom- 
fortable. Once it would have been 
brain-shattering. For a Citizen to 
see his own Citizeness unclothed 
was gross lechery. To be part of 
a mixed and bare-skinned group 
was unthinkable. Or had been. 
Now it only made him uneasy. 

He said numbly to Haendl: 
“Citizen, I pray you tell me what 
sort of place this is.” 

“Later,” said Haendl gruffly, 
and led him out of the way. “Stay 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



put,” he advised. “We’re busy.” 

And that was true. Something 
was going on, but Citizen Germyn 
couldn’t make out exactly what 
it was. The naked people were 
worrying out a distribution of 
some sort of supplies. There were 
tools and there were also what 
looked to Citizen Germyn’s un- 
sophisticated eyes very much like 
guns. Guns? It was foolishness to 
think they were guns, Citizen Ger- 
myn told himself strongly. Nobody 
had guns. He touched the floor 
with an exploratory hand. It was 
warm and it shook with a name- 
less distant vibration. He shud- 
dered. 

Haendl came back; yes, they 
were guns. Haendl was carrying 
one. 

“Ours!” he crowed. “That Tro- 
pile must’ve looted our armory at 
Princeton. By the looks of what’s 
here, I doubt if he left a single 
round of ammunition. What the 
hell, they’re more use here!” 

“But what are we going to do 
with guns?” 

Haendl looked at him with 
savage amusement. “Shoot.” 

Citizen Germyn said: “Please, 
Citizen. Tell me what this is all 
about.” 

Haendl sat down next to him 
on the warm, quivering floor and 
began fitting cartridges into a clip. 

“We’re fighting,” he explained 
gleefully. “Tropile did it all. 
You’ve been shanghaied and so 



have all the rest of us. Tropile’s 
alive! He’s part of the Pyramid 
communications network — don’t 
ask me how. But he’s there and he 
has been hauling men and weapons 
and God knows what all up from 
Earth— you’re on the binary planet 
now, you know— and we’re going 
to bust things up so the Pyramids 
will never be able to put them 
back together again. Understand? 
Well, it doesn’t matter if you 
don’t. All you have to understand 
is that when I tell you to shoot 
this gun, you shoot.” 

Numbly, Citizen Germyn took 
the unfamiliar stock and barrel 
into his hands. Muscles he had 
forgotten he owned straightened 
the limp curve of his back, squared 
his shoulders and thrust out his 
chest. 

It had been many generations 
since any of Citizen Germyn’s peo- 
ple had known the feeling of be- 
ing an Armed Man. 

A naked woman with wild hair 
and a full, soft figure came toward 
them, jiggling in a way that 
agonized Citizen Germyn. He 
dropped his eyes to his gun and 
kept them there. 

She cried: “Orders from Tro- 
pile! We’ve got to form a party and 
blow something up.” 

Haendl demanded: “Such as 
what?” 

“I don’t know what. I only know 
where. We’ve got a guide. And 
Tropile particularly asked for you, 



WOLFBANE 



87 



Haendl. He said you’d enjoy it.” 

And enjoy it Haendl did — an- 
ticipation was all over his face. 

TP HEY formed a party of a 
dozen. They armed themselves 
with the guns Tropile had levitated 
from the bulging warehouse at 
Princeton. They supplied them- 
selves with gray metal cans of 
something that Haendl said were 
explosives, and with fuses and 
detonators to match, and they set 
off— with their guide. 

A guide! It was a shambling, 
fearsome monster! 

When Citizen Germyn saw it, 
he had to fight an almost irresist- 
ible temptation to be ill. Even the 
bare skins about him no longer 
mattered; this new horror can- 
celed them out. 

“What — What — ” he strangled, 
pointing. 

Haendl laughed raucously. 
“That’s Joey.” 

“What’s Joey?” 

“He works for us,” said Haendl, 
grinning. 

Joey was neither human nor 
beast; it was not Pyramid; it was 
nothing Citizen Germyn had ever 
seen or imagined before. It 
crouched on many-jointed limbs, 
and even so was twice the height 
of a man. Its ropy arms and legs 
were covered with fine chitinous 
spines, laid on as close as hairs 
in a pelt, and sharp as thorns. 
There was a layer of chitin around 

88 



its reddish eyes. What was more 
horrible than all, it spoke. 

It said squeakily: “You all 

ready? Come on, snap it up! The 
Pyramids have got something big 
building up and we’ve got to 
squash it.” 

Citizen Germyn whispered fever- 
ishly to Haendl: “That voice! It 
sounds odd, yes— but isn’t it Tro- 
pile’s voice?” 

“Sure it is! That’s what old Joey 
is good for,” said Haendl. “Tropile 
says he’s telepathic, whatever that 
is. Makes it handy for us.” 

And it did. Telepathy was the 
alien’s very special use to Glenn 
Tropile, for what Joey was in fact 
was another Component, from a 
previous wristwatch mine. Joey’s 
planet had once circled a star 
never visible from Earth; his home 
air was thin and his home sunlight 
was weak, and in consequence his 
race had developed a species of 
telepathy for communicating at 
long range. This was handy for the 
Pyramids, because it simplified the 
wiring. And it was equally handy 
for Glenn Tropile, once he man- 
aged to wake the creature— with its 
permission, he could use its body 
as a sort of walkie-talkie in direct- 
ing the tactics of his shanghaied 
army. 

That permission was very readi- 
ly given. Joey remembered what 
the Pyramids had done to its own 
planet. 

“Come on!” ordered Joey in 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Tropile’s filtered voice, and they 
hastened through a straight and 
achingly cramped tunnel in single 
file, toward what Tropile had said 
was their target. 

They had nearly reached it 
when, abruptly, there was a thun- 
dering of explosions ahead. 

The party stopped, looked at 
each other, and got ready to move 
on more slowly. 

At last it had started. The Pyra- 
mids were beginning to fight back. 

XIII 

i^ITIZENESS Roget Germyn, 
^ widow, woke from sleep like 
a well-mannered cat on the nar- 
row lower third of the bed that 
her training had taught her to 
occupy, though it had been some 
days since her husband’s Transla- 
tion had emptied the Citizen’s two- 
thirds permanently. 

Someone had tapped gently on 
her door. 

“I am awake,” she called, in a 
voice just sufficient to carry. 

A quiet voice said: “Citizeness, 
there is exceptional opportunity to 
Appreciate this morning. Come 
see, if you will. And I ask forgive- 
ness for waking you.” 

She recognized the voice; it was 
the wife of one of her neighbors. 
The Citizeness made the appro- 
priate reply, combining forgiveness 
and gratitude. 

She dressed rapidly, but with 



appropriate pauses for reflection 
and calm, and stepped out into the 
street. 

It was not yet daylight. Over- 
head, great sheets of soundless 
lightnings flared. 

Inside Citizeness Germyn long- 
unfelt emotions stirred. There was 
something that was very like ter- 
ror, and something that was akin 
to love. This was a generation that 
had never seen the aurora, for 
the ricocheting electron beams that 
cause it could not span the in- 
creasing distance between the or- 
phaned Earth and its primary, Old 
Sol, and the small rekindled suns 
the Pyramids made were far too 
puny. 

Under the sleeting aurora, small 
knots of Citizens stood about the 
streets, their faces turned up to 
the sky and illuminated by the 
distant light. It was truly an ex- 
ceptional opportunity to Appreci- 
ate and they were all making the 
most of it. 

Conscientiously, Citizeness Ger- 
myn sought out another viewer 
with whom to exchange comments 
on the spectacle above. “It is more 
bright than meteors,” she said ju- 
diciously, “and lovelier than the 
freshly kindled Sun.” 

“Sure,” said the woman. Citi- 
zeness Germyn, jolted, looked 
more closely. It was the Tropile 
woman — Gala? Was that her 
name? And what sort of name was 
that? But it fitted her well; she 



WOLFBANE 



89 



was the one who had been wife 
to Wolf and, more likely than not, 
part Wolf herself. 

Still, the case was not proved. 
Citizeness Germyn said honestly: 
“I have never seen a sight to com- 
pare with this in all my life.” 

Gala Tropile said indifferently: 
“Yeah. Funny things are happen- 
ing all the time these days, have 
you noticed? Ever since Glenn 
turned out to be—” She stopped. 

Citizeness Germyn rapidly diag- 
nosed her embarrassment and 
acted to cover it up. “That is so. 
I have seen Eyes a hundred times 
and yet has there been a Transla- 
tion with the Eyes? No. But there 
have been Translations. It is 
queer.” 

“I suppose so,” Gala Tropile 
said, looking upward at the dis- 
play. She sighed. 

Over their heads, a formed Eye 
was drifting slowly about, but 
neither of the women noticed it. 
The shifting lights in the sky ob- 
scured it. 

“I wonder what causes that 
stuff,” Gala Tropile said idly. 

Citizeness Germyn made no at- 
tempt to answer. It was not the 
sort of question that would nor- 
mally have occurred to her and 
therefore not a sort to which she 
could reply. 

Moreover, it was not the ques- 
tion closest to Gala Tropile’s 
heart at that moment— nor, for 
that matter, the question closest to 

90 



Citizeness Germyn’s. The question 
that underlay the thoughts of both 
was: I wonder what happened to 
my husband. 

It was strange, but true, that 
the answers to all their questions 
were very nearly the same. 

>T»HE Alla-Narova mind said 
sharply: “Glenn, come back!” 

Tropile withdrew from scan- 
ning the distant dark street. He 
laughed soundlessly. “I was watch- 
ing my wife. God, we’re giving 
them fits down there! The Pyra- 
mids must be churning things up, 
too— the sky is full of auroral dis- 
plays. Looks like there’s plenty 
of h-f bouncing around the atmos- 
phere.” 

“Pay attention!” the Alla-Na- 
rova mind commanded. 

“All right.” Obediently, Tropile 
returned to the war he was waging. 

It was a strange conflict, 
strangely fought. Tropile’s mind 
searched the abysses and tunnels 
of the Pyramid planet, and what 
he sensed or saw was immediately 
communicated to all of the awak- 
ened Components who were his 
allies. 

It was a godlike position. Was 
he sane? There was no knowing. 
Sanity no longer meant anything 
to Tropile. He was beyond such 
human affairs as lunacy or its re- 
verse. An insane man is one who 
is out of joint with his environ- 
ment. Tropile was himself his 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



environment. His mind encom- 
passed two planets and the space 
between. He saw with a thousand 
eyes. He worked with a thousand 
hands. 

And he struck mighty blows. 

The weakness of a network that 
reaches everywhere is that it is 
everywhere vulnerable. If a tele- 
type repeater in Omaha garbles a 
single digit, printing units in At- 
lanta and Bangor will type out 
errors. Tropile, by striking at the 
Pyramids’ net at a thousand points, 
garbled their communications and 
made them nearly useless. More, 
he took the Pyramid network for 
his own. The Tropile-pulse sped 
through the neurone guides of the 
Pyramid net, and what it encoun- 
tered it mastered, and what it mas- 
tered it changed. 

The Pyramids discovered that 
they had been attacked. 

Frantically (if they felt fren- 
zy), the Pyramids replaced Com- 
ponents; the Tropile-pulse woke 
the new ones. Unbelievingly (did 
they know how to “believe”?), the 
Pyramids isolated contaminated 
circuits; the Tropile-pulse by- 
passed them. 

Desperately (or joyously or 
uffishly— one term fits exactly as 
well as another), the Pyramids re- 
turned to shove-and-haul, and 
there was much destruction, and 
some Components died. 

But by then, the Components 
had reprogrammed themselves. 



' 1 1 HE first job had been the mat- 
ter of finding hands for the 
Tropile-brain to work with. Bring 
hands in, then! Tropile com- 
manded the Pyramids’ network 
and obediently it was done. The 
Translation mechanism, the elec- 
trostatic scythe that had harvested 
so many crops from the wristwatch 
mines, suffered a change and went 
to work not for the pickers but 
for the fruit. 

The essential change in the 
operation of that particular pneu- 
ma had been simple; first, to “har- 
vest” or “Translate” the men and 
women Tropile wanted as fighters 
instead of the meditative Citizen 
kind. Second, to divert the new ar- 
rivals to where they would not go 
straight to deep-freeze. It hap- 
pened that the only alternate space 
Tropile could find was a sort of 
foundry that was nearly Hell, but 
that was only a detail. The im- 
portant thing was that new helpers 
were arriving, with minds of their 
own and the capacity to move and 
act. 

Then Tropile needed to com- 
municate with them. He found the 
alien, ropy-limbed Component 
whose name vaguely approached 
“Joey.” Joey’s limited sense of 
telepathy was needed and so, with 
enormous difficulty, Tropile and 
Alla Narova, combined, managed 
to reach and wake it. 

And so he had an army, cap- 
tured humans for troops, an awak- 



WOLFBANE 



91 



ened Joey for liaison. 

Tropile was lord of two worlds. 
Not only the Pyramids were un- 
der his thumb, but his own fellow 
humans whom he had drafted into 
his service. They ate when a cap- 
tured circuit he controlled fed syn- 
thetic mush into troughs for them. 
They breathed because a captured 
circuit he directed created air. 
They would return to Earth when 
—and only when— a captured cir- 
cuit he operated sent them home. 

Sane? 

By what standards? 

And what difference did it 
make? 

XIV 

YV7TTH a series of grinding 
’’ shocks, like an enormous 
earthquake-fault relieving a strain, 
the Pyramids began to fight back. 

“Tropile!” the Alla-Narova mind 
called urgently. 

Tropile flashed to the trouble 
spot. Through eyes that were not 
his own, Tropile scanned the 
honeycombed world of the Pyra- 
mids. There was an area where 
huge and ancient vehicles lay cov- 
ered with the slow dust of cen- 
turies, and the vehicles were be- 
ginning to move. 

Caterpillar-treaded hauling ma- 
chines were loading themselves 
with what Tropile judged were 
quickly synthesized explosives. Al- 
most forgotten wheeled vehicles 

92 



were creeping mindlessly out of 
nearly abandoned storage sections 
and lumbering painfully along the 
tunnels of the planet. 

“Coming toward us,” Tropile 
diagnosed dispassionately. 

Alla Narova queried: “They 

mean to fight?” 

“Of course. You see if you can 
penetrate the circuit that controls 
them. I—” already he was flashing 
away— “I’ll get to the boys through 
Joey.” 

It was queer, looking through 
the eyes of the alien they called 
Joey; colors were all wrong, per- 
spective was flat. But he could see, 
though cloudily. He saw Haendl 
joyously fitting a bayonet— a bay- 
onet !— to a rifle; he saw Citizen 
Germyn, naked but square-shoul- 
dered, puffing valiantly along in 
the rear. 

Tropile said through the strange 
vocal cords that belonged to the 
alien: “You’ll have to hurry.” 

(Strange to speak in words again!) 
“The Pyramids are heading toward 
the chambers where the Compo- 
nents are kept. I think they mean 
to kill us.” 

He flashed away, located the 
area, flashed back. “You’ll have 
to go without me— I mean without 
Joey-me. The only way I see to 
get there is through a narrow little 
ventilation tunnel — I guess venti- 
lation is what it was for.” 

Quickly (but against the famil- 
iar race of thought, it seemed 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



agonizingly slow) he laid out the 
route for them and left; it was up 
to them. Watching from a dozen 
viewpoints at once, he saw the slow 
creep of the Pyramids’ machines 
and the slower intersecting march 
of his little army. He studied the 
alternate cross routes and con- 
trived to block some of them by 
interfering with the control-circuits 
of the emergency doors and por- 
tals. 

But there were some circuits he 
could not control. The Pyramids 
had withdrawn whole sections of 
their net and areas of the planet 
were now hidden from him 
entirely. Sections of the vast 
maintenance - propulsion -manufac- 
turing complex were no longer 
subject to his interference or con- 
trol. 

TT would be, Tropile thought 
dispassionately, a rather close 
thing. The chances were perhaps 
six out of ten that his hastily as- 
sembled task force would be able 
to intercept the convoy of auto- 
matic machines before it could 
reach the racks of nutrient tanks. 

And if they were not in time? 

Tropile almost laughed out 
loud, if that had been possible. 
Why, then, his body would be de- 
stroyed! How trivial a thing to 
worry about! He began to forget 
he owned a body; surely it was 
someone else’s bone and tissue that 
lay floating in the eight-branched 



snowflake. He knew that this was 
not so. He knew that if his body 
were killed, he would die. And 
yet there was no sense of fear, no 
personal involvement. It was an 
interesting problem in scheduling 
and nothing more. 

Would the human fighters get 
there in time? 

Perhaps the automatic machines 
had senses, for as the first of the 
humans burst into the tunnel they 
were using, a few hundred yards 
ahead of the lead load-carrier, the 
machines shuddered to a stop. 
Pause for a second; then, labori- 
ously, they began to back toward 
the nearest of the side passages 
that Tropile had been unable to 
block. He scanned it hurriedly. 
Good, good! The circuits surround- 
ing the passage proper were out 
of his reach, but it led to another 
passage, an abandoned pipeline 
of sorts, it seemed to be. And 
that he could reach . 

Patiently (how slowly the ma- 
chines crept along!) he waited un- 
til one of the Pyramids’ machines 
bearing explosives passed through 
an enormous valve in the line— 
and then the valve was thrown. 

The explosion triggered every 
vehicle in the line. The damage 
was complete. 

Scratch one threat from the 
Pyramids— 

And almost at once, there was 
another urgent call from Alla Na- 
rova: “Tropile, quickly!” 



WOLFBANE

HPHE Pyramids were the 
■*- mightiest race of warriors the 
Universe had ever known. They 
were invulnerable and unconquer- 
able, except from within. Like 
Alexander the Great, they had met 
every enemy and whipped them 
all. And, like dying Alexander, 
they writhed and raged against 
the tiny, unseen bacillus within 
themselves. 

Blindly, almost suicidally, the 
Pyramids returned to their ancient 
principle of shove-and-haul. 

The geography of the binary 
planet was like a hive of bees, 
nearly featureless on the surface, 
but internally a congeries of tun- 
nels, chambers, warrens, rooms, 
tubes and amphitheaters. Machin- 
ery and metal Components were 
everywhere thick under the 
planet’s crust. The more delicate 
and more useful Components of 
flesh and blood were, to a degree, 
concentrated in a few areas . 

And one of those areas had dis- 
appeared. 

Tropile, battering futilely with 
his mind at the periphery of the 
vanished area, cried sharply to 
Alla Narova and the others: “It 
looks as though they’ve broken a 
piece right out of the planet! 
Everything stops here— there’s a 
physical gap which I can’t cross. 
Hurry, one of you— what was this 
section for?” 

“Propulsion.” 

“I see.” Tropile hesitated, con-

fused for the first time since his 
awakening. “Wait.” 

He retreated to the snowflake 
and communed with the other 
eight-branched members, now be- 
come something that resembled 
his general staff. He told them— 
most of them already knew, but 
the telling took so little time that 
it was simpler to go through it 
from beginning to end: 

“The Pyramids attempted to 
cut the propulsion-pneuma out of 
circuit some seconds or days ago 
and were unsuccessful; we awak- 
ened additional Components and 
were able to maintain contact with 
it. They have now apparently cut 
it loose from the planet itself. I 
do not think it is far, but there is 
a physical space between.” 

“The importance of the propul- 
sion-pneuma is this: It controls 
the master generators of electro- 
static force, which are used both 
to move this planet and ours, and 
to perform the act of Translation. 
If the Pyramids control it, they 
may be able to take us out of cir- 
cuit, perhaps back to Earth, per- 
haps throwing us into space, where 
we will die. The question for de- 
cision: How can we counteract 
this move?” 

A RUSH of voices all spoke at 
once; it was no trick for Tro- 
pile and the others to sort them 
out and follow the arguments of 
each, but it cannot be reproduced. 

96 



At last, one said: “There is a 
way. I will do it.” 

It was Alla Narova. 

“What is the way?” Tropile de- 
manded, curiously alarmed. 

“I shall go with them, trace the 
areas the Pyramids are attempting 
to isolate, place my entire self—” 
by this she meant her “concentra- 
tion,” her “psyche,” that part of all 
of them which flashed along the 
neurone guides unhampered by 
flesh or distance—” in the most 
likely point they will next cut 
loose. And then I shall cause the 
propulsion units on the severed 
sections to force them back into 
circuit.” 

Tropile objected: “But you 

don’t know what will happen! We 
have never been cut off from our 
physical bodies, Alla Narova. It 
may be death. It may not be pos- 
sible at all. You don’t know!” 

Alla Narova thought a smile and 
a farewell. She said: “No, I do 
not.” And then, “Good-by, Tro- 
pile.” 

She had gone. 

Furiously, Tropile hurled him- 
self after her, but she was quick 
as he, too quick to catch; she was 
gone. Foolishness, foolishness! he 
shouted silently. How could she do 
an insane, chancy thing like this? 

And yet what else was there to 
do? They were all ignorant babes, 
temporarily successful because 
there had been no defense against 
them, for who expects babes to rise 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



up in rebellion? They didn’t know. 
For all they could guess or 
imagine, the Pyramids had an ef- 
fective counter for any move they 
might make. Temporary success 
meant nothing. It was the final 
decision that counted, when either 
the Pyramids were vanquished or 
the men, and what steps were 
needed to make that decision favor 
the men were anyone’s guess— 
Alla Narova’s was as good as his. 

Tropile could only watch and 
wait. 

Through a great many view- 
points and observers, he was able 
to see roughly what happened. 

T HERE was a section of the 
planet next the severed chunk 
where the mind and senses of Al- 
la Narova lay coiled for a moment 
—and were gone. For what it had 
accomplished, her purpose suc- 
ceeded. She had been taken. She 
was out of circuit. 

The overwhelming conscious- 
ness of loss that flooded through 
Glenn Tropile was something out- 
side of all his experience. 

Next to him in the snowflake, 
the body which he had learned to 
think of as the body of Alla Na- 
rova twisted sharply as though 
waking from a dream— and lay 
flaccid, floating in the fluid. 

“Alla Narova! Alla Narova!” 
There was no answer. 

A voice came piercingly: “Tro- 
pile! Here now, quickly!” 



Good-by, Alla Narova! He 
flashed away to see what the other 
voice had found. Great mindless 
boulders were chipping away from 
the crust of the binary planet and 
whirling like midges in the void 
around it. 

“What is it?” cried one of the 
others. 

Tropile had no answer. It was 
the Pyramids, clearly. Were they 
attempting to demolish their own 
planet? Were they digging away at 
the crust to uncover the maggot’s- 
nest of awakened Components be- 
neath? 

“The air!” cried Tropile sharply, 
and knew it was true. What the 
Pyramids were up to was a simple 
delousing operation. If you could 
destroy their own machinery for 
maintaining air and pressure and 
temperature, they would destroy 
all living things within — including 
Haendl and Citizen Germyn and 
thus, in the final analysis, includ- 
ing the bodies of Tropile and his 
awakened fellows. For without the 
mobile troops to defend their help- 
less cocoons against the machines 
of the Pyramids, the limp bodies 
could be destroyed as easily as a 
larva under a farmer’s heel. 

So Alla Narova had failed. 

Alone against the Pyramids, she 
had been unable to bring the re- 
captured sections back into the cir- 
cuit that Tropile’s Components 
now dominated. It was the end 
of hope; but it was not the fear 



WOLFBANE 



97 



of defeat and damnation for the 
Earth that paralyzed Tropile. It 
was Alla Narova, gone from him 
forever. 

The Pyramids were too strong. 

And yet, he thought, quicken- 
ing, they had been too strong be- 
fore and still a weak spot had been 
found! 

“Think,” he ordered himself 
desperately. 

And then again: “Think!” Com- 
ponents stirred restlessly around 
him, questioning. “Think!” he 
cried mightily. “All of you, think! 
Think of your lives and hopes! 

“Think! 

“Hope! 

“Worry! 

“Dream!” 

The Components were reaching 
toward him now, wonderingly. He 
commanded them violently: “Do 
it— concentrate, wish, think! Let 
your minds run free and think of 
Earth, pleasant grass and warm 
sun! Think of loving and sweat 
and heartbreak! Think of death 
and birth! Think, for the love of 
heaven, think!" 

And the answer was not in 
sound, but it was deafening. 

IN the cut-off sections, Alla Na- 

rova’s soaring mind lay trapped. 
It had not been enough; she could 
not force her will against the dull 
inflexibility of the Pyramids . 

Until that inflexible will began 
to waver. 

98 



There was a leakage of thought. 

It maddened and baffled the 
Pyramids. The whole neuronic 
network was resounding to a bab- 
ble of thoughts and emotions that, 
to a Pyramid, were utterly de- 
mented! The rousing Component 
minds throbbed with urge and 
emotion that were new to Pyramid 
experience. What could a Pyra- 
mid make of a human’s sex drive? 
Or of the ropy-armed aliens’ pas- 
sionate deification of the Egg? 
What of hunger and thirst and the 
blazing Wolf-need for odds and 
advantage that streamed out of 
such as Tropile? 

They wavered, unsure. Their 
reactions were slow and very 
confused. 

For Alla Narova succeeded in 
her purpose. She was able to reach 
out across the space and barrier to 
Tropile and the propulsion-pneu- 
ma was back in circuit. The sec- 
tion that controlled the master 
generators of the electronic scythe 
lay under his hands. 

“Now!” he cried, and all of the 
Components reached out to grasp 
and move. 

“Now!” And the central control 
was theirs; the full flood of power 
from the generators was at their 
command. 

“Now! Now! Now!” And they 
reached out, with a fat pencil of 
electrostatic force and caught the 
sluggish, brooding Pyramid on 
Mount Everest. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It had squatted there without 
motion for more than two cen- 
turies. Now it quivered and seemed 
to draw back, but the probing pen- 
cil caught it, and whirled it, and 
hurled it up and out of Earth, 
into the tiny artificial sun. 

It struck with a flare of blue- 
white light. 

“One gone!” gloated Tropile. 
“Alla Narova, are you there?” 

“Still here,” she called from a 
great distance. “Again?” 

“Again!” 

They reached for the Pyramids 
and found them, wherever they 
were. Some lay close to the sur- 
face of the binary planet, and 
some were hundreds of miles with- 
in, and a few, more desperate than 
the others or merely assigned to 
the task, they discovered at the 
very portal of the single space- 
ship of the Pyramids. 

But wherever they were and 
whatever they chose to do, each 
one of them was found and seized. 
They came wriggling and shak- 
ing, like trout on an angler’s line. 
They came bursting through layer 
on layer of impenetrable metal 
that, nevertheless, they penetrated. 
They came by the dozens and 
scores, and at last by the thou- 
sands; but they came. 

There were more and more 
flares of blue-white light on the 
tiny sun— so many that Tropile 
found himself scouring the planet 
in a desperate search for one sur- 



viving Pyramid— not to destroy as 
an enemy, but to keep for a speci- 
men. 

But he searched in vain. 

The Pyramids were destroyed, 
gone. There was not one left. The 
Earth lay open and free under its 
tiny sun for the first time in cen- 
turies. 

It had been a strange war, but 
a short one. 

And it was over. 

XIV 

r TTROPILE swam up out of ham- 
•*- mering blackness into daylight 
and pain. 

It hurt. He was being born 
again— coming back to life— and it 
had all the agonies of parturition, 
except that they were visited upon 
the creature being born, himself. 
There were crushing blows at his 
temples that pounded and pained 
like no other ache he had ever 
felt. He moaned raspingly. 

Someone moved blurrily over 
his shut eyes. He felt something 
sting sharply at the base of his 
brain. Then it tingled, warming 
his scalp, comforting it, numbing 
it. Pain went slowly away. 

He opened his eyes. 

Four masked torturers were 
leaning over him. He stared, not 
understanding; but the eyes were 
not torturers’ eyes, and in a mo- 
ment the masks came off. Surgical 
masks— and the faces beneath the 



WOLFBANE 



99 



masks were human faces. 

Surgeons and nurses. 

He blinked at them and said 
groggily: “Where am we?” And 
then he remembered. 

He was back on Earth; he was 
merely human again. 

Someone came bustling into the 
room and he knew without look- 
ing that it was Haendl. 

“We beat them, Tropile!” 
Haendl cried. “No, cancel that. 
You beat them. We’ve destroyed 
every Pyramid there was, and a 
nice hot fire they’re making up 
there on the sun, eh? Beautiful 
work, Tropile. Beautiful! You’re a 
credit to the name of Wolf!” 

The surgeons stirred uneasily, 
but apparently, Tropile thought, 
there had been changes, for they 
did no more than that. 

Tropile touched his temples fret- 
fully and his fingers rested on 
gauze bandages. It was true: he 
was out of circuit. The long reach 
of his awareness was cut short at 
his skull; there was no more of the 
infinite sweep and grasp he had 
known as part of the snowflake in 
the nutrient fluid. 

“Too bad,” he whispered hope- 
lessly. 

“What?” Haendl frowned. The 
nurse next to him whispered some- 
thing and he nodded. “Oh, I see. 
You’re still a little groggy, right? 
Well, that’s not hard to under- 
stand— they tell me it was a tricky 
job 6f surgery, separating you from 

100 



that gunk the Pyramids had wired 
into your head.” 

“Yes,” said Tropile, and closed 
his ears, though Haendl went on 
talking. After a while, Tropile 
pushed himself up and swung his 
legs over the side of the operating 
table. He was naked. Once that 
would have bothered him enor- 
mously, but now it didn’t seem to 
matter. 

“Find me some clothes, will 
you?” he asked. “I’m back. I might 
as well start getting used to it.” 

LENN Tropile found that he 
was a returning hero, attract- 
ing a curious sort of hero-worship 
wherever he went. It was not, he 
thought after careful analysis, 
exactly what he might have ex- 
pected. For instance, a man who 
went out and killed a dragon in 
the old days was received with 
great gratitude and rejoicing, and 
if there was a prince’s daughter 
around, he married her. Fair 
enough, after all. And Tropile had 
slain a foe more potent than any 
number of dragons. 

But he tested the attention he 
received and found no gratitude in 
it. It was odd. 

What it was like most of all, 
he thought, was the sort of at- 
tention a reigning baseball cham- 
pion might get— in a country where 
cricket was the national game. He 
had done something which, every- 
body agreed, was an astonishing 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



feat, but about which nobody 
Seemed to care. Indeed, there was 
an area of accusation in some of 
the attention he got. 

Item: nearly ninety thousand 
erstwhile Components had now 
been brought back to ambient life, 
most of them with their families 
long dead, all of them a certain 
drain on the limited resources of 
the planet. And what was Glenn 
Tropile going to do about it? 

Item: the old distinctions be- 
tween Citizen and Wolf no longer 
made much sense now that so 
many Componentized Citizens had 
fought shoulder to shoulder with 
Componentized Sons of the Wolf. 
But didn’t Glenn Tropile think he 
had gone a little too far there? 

And item — looking pretty far 
ahead, of course, but still— well, 
just what was Glenn Tropile go- 
ing to do about providing a new 
sun for Earth, when the old one 
wore out and there would be no 
Pyramids to tend the fire? 

He sought refuge with some- 
one who would understand him. 
That, he was pleased to realize, 
was easy. He had come to know 
several persons extremely well. 
Loneliness, the tortured loneliness 
of his youth, was permanently be- 
hind him, definitely. 

For example, he could seek out 
Haendl, who would understand 
everything very well. 

Haendl said: “It is a bit of a 
letdown, I suppose. Well, hell with 



it; that’s life.” He laughed grimly. 
“Now that we’ve got rid of the 
Pyramids, there’s plenty of other 
work to be done. Man, we can 
breathe now! We can plan ahead! 
This planet has maundered along 
in its stupid, rutted, bogged-down 
course too many years already, eh? 
It’s time we took over! And we’ll 
be doing it, I promise you. You 
know, Tropile—” he sniggered— “I 
only regret one thing.” 

“What’s that?” Tropile asked 
cautiously. 

“All those weapons, out of reach! 
Oh, I’m not blaming you. But you 
can see what a lot of trouble it’s 
going to be now, stocking up all 
over again— and there isn’t much 
we can do about bringing order to 
this tired old world, is there, until 
we’ve got the guns to do it with 
again?” 

Tropile left him much sooner 
than he had planned. 

Z”' 1 ITIZEN Germyn, then? The 
man had fought well, if 
nothing else. Tropile went to find 
him and, for a moment at least, 
it was very good. Germyn said: 
“I’ve been doing a lot of think- 
ing, Tropile. I’m glad you’re here.” 
He sent his wife for refreshments, 
and decorously she brought them 
in, waited for exactly one minute, 
and then absented herself. 

Tropile burst into speech as 
soon as she left. “I’m beginning to 
realize what has happened to the 



WOLFBANE 



101 



human race, Germyn. I don’t mean 
just now, when we licked the 
Pyramids and so on. No, I mean 
hundreds of years ago, what hap- 
pened when the Pyramids arrived, 
and what has been happening 
since. Did you ever hear of In- 
dians, Germyn?” 

Germyn frowned minutely and 
shrugged. 

“They were, oh, hundreds and 
hundreds of years ago. They were 
a different color and not very civ- 
ilized — of course, nobody was 
then. But the Indians were no- 
mads, herdsmen, hunters— like that. 
And the white people came from 
Europe and wanted this country 
for themselves. So they took it. 
And do you know something? I 
don’t think the Indians ever knew 
what hit them.” 

“They didn’t know about land 
grants and claiming territory for 
the crown and church missions 
and expanding populations. They 
didn’t have those things. It’s true 
that they learned pretty well, by 
and by — at least they learned 
things like guns and horses and 
firewater; they didn’t have those 
things, either, but they could see 
some sense to them, you know. But 
I really don’t think the Indians 
ever knew exactly what the Euro- 
peans were up to, until it was too 
late to matter. 

“And it was the same with us 
and the Pyramids, only more so. 
What the devil did they want? I 

102 



mean, yes, we found out what they 
did with the Translated people. 
But what were they up to? What 
did they think? Did they think? 
You know, I’ve got a kind of a 
crazy idea— maybe it’s not crazy, 
maybe it’s the truth. Anyway, I’ve 
been thinking. Suppose even the 
Pyramids weren’t the Pyramids? 
We never talked to one of them. 
We never gave it a Rorschach or 
tested its knee jerks. We licked 
them, but we don’t know anything 
about them. We don’t even know 
if they were the guys that started 
the whole bloody thing, or if they 
were just sort of super-sized Com- 
ponents themselves. Do we? 

“And meanwhile, here’s the hu- 
man race, up against something 
that it not only can’t understand, 
same as the Indians couldn’t the 
whites, but that it can’t begin to 
make a guess about. At least the 
Indians had a clue now and then, 
you know— I mean they’d see the 
sailors off the great white devil 
ship making a beeline for the In- 
dian women and so on, and they’d 
begin to understand there was 
something in common. But we 
didn’t have that much. 

“So what did we do? Why, we 
did like the reservation Indians. 
We turned inward. We got loaded 
on firewater— Meditation— and we 
closed our minds to the possibility 
of ever expanding again. And there 
we were, all tied up in our own 
knots. Most of the race rebelled 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



against action, because it had 
proven useless— Citizens. A few 
of the race rebelled against that, 
because it was not only useless but 
deliberately useless— Wolves. But 
they’re the same kind of people. 
You’ve seen that for yourself, 
right? And—” 

Tropile stopped, suddenly aware 
that Citizen Germyn was looking 
tepidly pained. 

“What’s the matter?” Tropile 
demanded harshly. 

Citizen Germyn gave him the 
faint deprecatory Quirked Smile. 
“I know you thought you were a 
Wolf, but— I told you I’ve been 
thinking a lot, and that’s what I 
was thinking about. Truly, Citizen, 
you do yourself no good by pre- 
tending that you really thought 
you were Wolf. Clearly you were 
not; the rest of us might have been 
fooled, but certainly you couldn’t 
fool yourself. 

“Now here’s what I think you 
ought to do. When I found you 
were coming, I asked several 
rather well-known Citizens to come 
here later this evening. There won’t 
be any embarrassment. I only 
want you to talk to them and set 
the record straight, so that this 
terrible blemish will no longer be 
held against you. Times change 
and perhaps a certain latitude is 
advisable now, but certainly you 
don’t want—” 

Tropile also left Citizen Germyn 
sooner than he had expected to. 



T HERE remained Alla Narova, 
but, queerly, she was not to 
be found. 

Instantly it became clear to 
Tropile that it was she above all 
whom he needed to talk to. He re- 
membered the shared beauty of 
their plunging drive through the 
neurone-guides of the Pyramids, 
the linked and inextricable flow 
of their thoughts and of their most 
hidden feelings. 

She could not be very far, he 
thought numbly, cursing the blind- 
ness of his human eyes, the nar- 
rowness of his human senses. Time 
was when two worlds could not 
have hidden her from him; but that 
time was gone. He walked from 
place to place with the angry re- 
sentful tread of one used to rid- 
ing— no, to flying, or faster than 
flying. He asked after her. He 
searched. 

And at last he found — not her. 
A note. At one of the stations 
where the re-awakened Compo- 
nents were funneled back into hu- 
man affairs, there was a letter wait- 
ing for him: 

I’m sure you will look lor me. 
Please don’t. You thought that 
there were no secrets between us, 
but there was one. 

When I was Translated, I was 
sixty-one years old. Two years be- 
fore that, I was caught in a col- 
lapsing building; my legs are use- 
less, and I had grown quite fat. 



WOLFBANE 



103 



I do not want you to see me fat 
and old. 

Alla Narova. 

And that was that, and at last 
Glenn Tropile turned to the last 
person of all those on his list who 
had known him well. Her name 
was Gala Tropile. 

Q HE had got thinner, he ob- 
^ served. They sat together 
quietly and there was considerable 
awkwardness, but then he noticed 
that she was weeping. Comforting 
her ended the awkwardness and 
he found that he was talking: 

“It was like being a god, Gala! 
I swear, there’s no feeling like it. 
I mean it’s like — well, maybe if 
you’d just had a baby, and in- 
vented fire, and moved a moun- 
tain, and transmuted lead into gold 
—maybe if you’d done all of those 
things, then you might have some 
idea. But I was everywhere at 
once, Gala, and I could do any- 
thing! I fought a whole world of 
Pyramids, do you realize that? Me! 
And now I come back to—” 

He stopped her in time; 
it seemed she was about to weep 
again. 

He went on: “No, Gala, don’t 
misunderstand, I don’t hold any- 
thing against you. You were right 
to leave me in the field. What did 
I have to offer you? Or myself, 
for that matter? And I don’t know 
that I have anything now, but—”

He slammed his fist against the 
table. “They talk about putting 
the Earth back in its orbit! Why? 
And how? My God, Gala, we 
don’t know where we are. Maybe 
we could tinker up the gadgets 
the Pyramids used and turn our 
course backward— but do you know 
what Old Sol looks like? I don’t. 
I never saw it. 

“And neither did you or any- 
one else alive. 

“It was like being a god— 

“And they talk about going back 
to things as they were— 

“I’m sick of that kind of think- 
ing! Wolves or Citizens, they’re 
dead on their feet and don’t know 
it. I suppose they’ll snap out of it 
in time, but I can’t wait. I won’t 
live that long. 

“Unless-” 

He paused and looked at her, 
confused. 

Gala Tropile met her husband’s 
eyes. 

“Unless what, Glenn?” 

He shrugged and turned away. 

“Unless you go back, you mean.” 
He stared at her; she nodded. 
“You want to go back,” she said, 
without stress. “You don’t want 
to stay here with me, do you? You 
want to go back into that tub of 
soup again and float like a baby. 
You don’t want to have babies— 
you want to be one.” 

“Gala, you don’t understand. We 
can own the Universe. I mean 
mankind can. And I can do it. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Why not? There’s nothing for 
me—” 

“That’s right, Glenn. There’s 
nothing for you here. Not any 
more.” 

He opened his mouth to speak, 
looked at her, spread his hands 
helplessly. He didn’t look back as 
he walked out the door, but he 
knew that his back was turned not 
only on the woman who happened 
to be his wife, but on mankind 
and all of the flesh. 

T T was night outside, and warm. 

Tropile stood in the old street 
surrounded by the low, battered 
houses— and he could make them 
new and grand! He looked up at 
the stars that swung in constella- 
tions too new and changeable to 
have names. There was the Uni- 
verse. 

Words were no good; there was 
no explaining things in words. 
Naturally he couldn’t make Gala 
or anyone else understand, for 
flesh couldn’t grasp the realities 
of mind and spirit that were liber- 
ated from flesh. Babies! A home! 



And the whole grubby animal 
business of eating and drinking 
and sleeping! How could anyone 
ask to stay in the mire when the 
stars challenged overhead? 

He walked slowly down the 
street, alone in the night, an ap- 
prentice godling renouncing mor- 
tality. There was nothing here for 
him, so why this sense of loss? 

Duty said (or was it Pride?): 
“Someone must give up the flesh 
to control Earth’s orbit and 
weather— why not you?” 

Flesh said (or was it his soul— 
whatever that was? ) : “But you 
will be alone.” 

He stopped, and for a moment 
he was poised between destiny and 
the dust . 

Until he became aware of foot- 
steps behind him, running, and 
Gala’s voice: “Wait! Wait, Glenn! 
I want to go with you!” 

And he turned and waited, but 
only until she caught up, and then 
he went on. 

But not — forever and always 
again — not alone.

FLANNEL 

ARMOR 

By FINN O'DONNEVAN 



Would knights have been still 
more bold in days of old ... if 
they'd had transistor amulets? 



T HE means which Thomas 
Hanley selected to meet 
the girl who later became 
his wife is worthy of note, par- 
ticularly by anthropologists, so- 
ciologists and students of the bi- 
zarre. It serves, in its humble 
way, as an example of one of the 
more obscure mating customs of 



the late 20th century. And since 
this custom had an impact upon 
modern American industry, Han- 
ley’s story has considerable im- 
portance. 

Thomas Hanley was a tall, slim 
young man, conservative in his 
tastes, moderate in his vices, and 
modest to a fault. His conversa- 



lllustrated by DILLON

tion with either sex was perfect- 
ly proper, even to the point of 
employing the verbal improprie- 
ties suitable to his age and sta- 
tion. He owned several gray 
flannel suits and many slim neck- 
ties with regimental stripes. You 
might think you could pick him 
out of a crowd because of his 
horn-rimmed glasses, but you 
would be wrong. That wasn’t 
Hanley. Hanley was the other 
one. 

Who would believe that, be- 
neath this meek, self-effacing, in- 
dustrious, conforming exterior 
beat a wildly romantic heart? 
Sadly enough, anyone would, for 
the disguise fooled only the dis- 
guised. 

Young men like Hanley, in 
their gray flannel armor and horn- 
rimmed visors, are today’s 
knights of chivalry. Millions of 
them roam the streets of our 
great cities, their footsteps firm 
and hurried, eyes front, voices 
lowered, dressed to the point of 
invisibility. Like actors or be- 
witched men, they live their 
somber live', While within them 
the flame of romance burns and 
will not die. 

Hanley daydreamed continual- 
ly and predictably of the swish 
and thud of swinging cutlasses, of 
great ships driving toward the 
sun under a press of sail, of a 
maiden’s eyes, dark and infinite- 
ly sad, peering at him from be- 



hind a gossamer veil. And, pre- 
dictably still, he dreamed of more 
modern forms of romance. 

But romance is a commodity 
difficult to come by in the great 
cities. This fact was recognized 
only recently by our more enter- 
prising businessmen. And one 
night, Hanley received a visit from 
an unusual sort of salesman. 

TTANLEY had returned to his 
one-room apartment after a 
harried Friday at the office. He 
loosened his tie and contem- 
plated, with a certain melancholy, 
the long weekend ahead. He 
didn’t want to watch the boxing 
on television and he had seen 
all the neighborhood movies. 
Worst of all, the girls he knew 
were uninteresting and his 
chances for meeting others were 
practically nil. 

He sat in his armchair as the 
deep blue twilight spread over 
Manhattan, and speculated on 
where he might find an interest- 
ing girl, and what he would say 
if he found one, and — 

His doorbell rang. 

As a rule, only peddlers or 
solicitors for the Firemen’s Fund 
called on him unannounced. But 
tonight he could welcome even 
the momentary pleasure of turn- 
ing down a peddler. So he opened 
the door and saw a short, dap- 
per, flashily dressed little man 
beaming at him.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Good evening, Mr. Hanley,” 
the little man said briskly. “I’m 
Joe Morris, a representative of 
the New York Romance Service, 
with its main office in the Em- 
pire State Building and branches 
in all the boroughs, Westchester 
and New Jersey. We’re out to 
serve lonely people, Mr. Hanley, 
and that means you. Don’t deny 
it! Why else would you be sit- 
ting home on a Friday night? 
You’re lonely and it’s our busi- 
ness and our pleasure to serve 
you. A bright, sensitive, good- 
looking young fellow like your- 
self needs girls, nice girls, pleas- 
ant, pretty, understanding girls—” 

“Hold on,” Hanley said stern- 
ly. “If you run some sort of a 
fancy call girl bureau — ” 

He stopped, for Joe Morris had 
turned livid. The salesman’s 
throat swelled with anger and 
he turned and started to leave. 

“Wait!” said Hanley. “I’m 
sorry.” 

“I’ll have you know, sir, I’m a 
family man,” Joe Morris said 
stiffly. “I have a wife and three 
children in the Bronx. If you 
think for a minute I’d associate 
myself with anything under- 
handed — ” 

“I’m really sorry.” Hanley 
ushered Morris in and gave him 
the armchair. 

Mr. Morris immediately re- 
gained his brisk and jovial man- 
ner. 



“No, Mr. Hanley,” he said, 
“the young ladies I refer to are 
not — ah — professionals. They are 
sweet, normal, romantically in- 
clined young girls. But they are 
lonely. There are many lonely 
girls in our city, Mr. Hanley.” 

COMEHOW, Hanley had 
^ thought the condition ap- 
plied only to men. “Are there?” 
he asked. 

“There are. The purpose of 
the New York Romance Service,” 
said Morris, “is to bring young 
people together under suitable 
circumstances.” 

“Hmm,” Hanley said. “I take 
it then you run a sort of— if you’ll 
pardon the expression — a sort of 
Friendship Club?” 

“Not at all! Nothing like it! 
My dear Mr. Hanley, have you 
ever attended a Friendship 
Club?” 

Hanley shook his head. 

“You should, sir,” said Morris. 
“Then you could really appre- 
ciate our Service. Friendship 
Clubs! Picture, if you will, a bar- 
ren hall, one flight up in the 
cheaper Broadway area. At one 
end, five musicians in frayed 
tuxedos play, with a dreary lack 
of enthusiasm, the jittery songs 
of the day. Their thin music 
echoes disconsolately through the 
hall and blends with the screech 
of traffic outside. There is a row 
of chairs on either side of the 



GRAY FLANNEL ARMOR 



109 



hall, men on one side, women on 
the other. All are acutely em- 
barrassed by their presence there. 

“They cling to a wretched non- 
chalance, nervously chain-smok- 
ing cigarettes and stamping out 
the butts on the floor. From time 
to time, some unfortunate gets 
up his courage to ask for a dance 
and, stiffly, he moves his partner 
around the floor, under the lewd 
and cynical eyes of the rest. The 
master of ceremonies, an over- 
stuffed idiot with a fixed and 
ghastly smile, hurries around, 
trying to inject some life into the 
corpse of the evening. But to no 
avail.” 

Morris paused for breath. 
“That is the anachronism known 
as the Friendship Club — a 
strained, nervous, distasteful in- 
stitution better suited to Vic- 
torian times than to our own. At 
the New York Romance Service, 
we have done what should have 
been done years ago. We have 
applied scientific precision and 
technological know-how to a 
thorough study of the factors es- 
sential to a successful meeting 
between the sexes.” 

“What are those factors?” Han- 
ley inquired. 

“The most vital ones,” said 
Morris, “are spontaneity and a 
sense of fatedness.” 

“Spontaneity and fate seem to 
be contradictory terms,” Hanley 
pointed out. 

no 



“Of course. Romance, by its 
very nature, must be composed of 
contradictory elements. We have 
graphs to prove it.” 

“Then you sell romance?” Han- 
ley asked dubiously. 

“The very article! The pure 
and pristine substance itself! Not 
sex, which is available to every- 
one. Not love — no way of guar- 
anteeing permanency and there- 
fore commercially impracticable. 
We sell romance, Mr. Hanley, the 
missing ingredient in modern so- 
ciety, the spice of life, the vision 
of all the ages!” 

“That’s very interesting,” Han- 
ley said. But he questioned the 
validity of Morris’s claims. The 
man might be a charlatan or he 
might be a visionary. Whatever 
he was, Hanley doubted whether 
he could sell romance. Not the 
real thing. Not the dark and fit- 
ful visions which haunted Han- 
ley’s days and nights. 

TIE stood up. “Thank you, Mr. 

Morris. I’ll think over what 
you’ve said. Right now, I’m in 
rather a rush, so if you wouldn’t 
mind — ” 

“But, sir! Surely you can’t af- 
ford to pass up romance!" 

“Sorry, but - ” 

“Try our system for a few days, 
absolutely free of charge,” Mr. 
Morris said. “Here, put this in 
your lapel.” He handed Hanley 
something that looked like a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



small transistor radio with a tiny 
video eye. 

“What’s this?” Hanley asked. 

“A small transistor radio with 
a tiny video eye.” 

“What does it do?” 

“You’ll see. Just give it a try. 
We’re the country’s biggest firm 
specializing in romance, Mr. Han- 
ley. We aim to stay that way by 
continuing to fill the needs of 
millions of sensitive young Amer- 
ican men and women. Remember 
—romances sponsored by our firm 
are fated, spontaneous, esthetical- 
ly satisfying, physically delight- 
ful and morally justifiable.” 

And with that, Joe Morris 
shook Hanley’s hand and left. 

Hanley turned the tiny transis- 
tor radio in his hand. It had no 
buttons or dials. He fastened it 
to the lapel of his jacket. Nothing 
happened. 

He shrugged his shoulders, 
tightened his tie and went out 
for a walk. 

It was a clear, cool night. Like 
most nights in Hanley’s life, it 
was a perfect time for romance. 
Around him lay the city, infinite 
in its possibilities and rich in 
promise. But the city was devoid 
of fulfillment. He had walked 
these streets a thousand nights, 
with firm step, eyes front, ready 
for anything. And nothing had 
ever happened. 

He passed apartment buildings 
and thought of the women be- 



hind the high, blank windows, 
looking down, seeing a lonely * 
walker on the dark streets and 
wondering about him, thinking . 

“Nice to be on the roof of a 
building,” a voice said. “To look 
down on the city.” 

Hanley stopped short and 
whirled around. He was complete- 
ly alone. It took him a moment 
to realize that the voice had come 
from the tiny transistor radio. 

“What?” Hanley asked. 

The radio was silent. 

Look down on the city, Han- 
ley mused. The radio was sug- 
gesting he look down on the city. 
Yes, he thought, it would be nice. 

“Why not?” Hanley asked him- 
self, and turned toward a build- 
ing. 

“Not that one,” the radio whis- 
pered. 

Hanley obediently passed by 
the building and stopped in front 
of the next. 

“This one?” he queried. 

The radio didn’t answer. But 
Hanley caught the barest hint 
of an approving little grunt. 

Well, he thought, you had to 
hand it to the Romance Service. 
They seemed to know what they 
were doing. His movements were 
as nearly spontaneous as any 
guided movements could be. 



F NTERING the building, Han- 
ley stepped into the self- 
service elevator and punched for 



GRAY FLANNEL ARMOR 



111 



the top floor. From there, he 
climbed a short flight of stairs to 
the roof. Once outside, he began 
walking toward the west side of 
the building. 

“Other side,” whispered the 
radio. 

Hanley turned and walked to 
the other side. There he looked 
out over the city, at the orderly 
rows of street lights, white and 
faintly haloed. Dotted here and 
there were the reds and greens 
of traffic lights, and the occasional 
colored blotch of an electric sign. 
His city stretched before him, in- 
finite in its possibilities, rich in 
promise, devoid of fulfillment. 

Suddenly he became aware of 
another person on the roof, star- 
ing raptly at the spectacle of 
lights. 

“Excuse me,” said Hanley. 
“Didn’t mean to intrude.” 

“You didn’t,” the person said, 
and Hanley realized he was talk- 
ing to a woman. 

We are strangers, Hanley 
thought. A man and a woman 
who meet by accident — or fate — 
on a dark rooftop overlooking the 
city. He wondered how many 
dreams the Romance Service had 
analyzed, how many visions they 
had tabulated, to produce some- 
thing as perfect as this. 

Glancing at the girl, he saw 
that she was young and lovely. 
Despite her outward composure, 
he sensed how the rightness of 

112 



this meeting, the place, the time, 
the mood stirred her as it did 
him. 

He thought furiously, but could 
find nothing to say. No words 
came to him and the moment was 
drifting away. 

“The lights,” prompted his 
radio. 

“The lights are beautiful,” said 
Hanley, feeling foolish. 

“Yes,” murmured the girl. 
“Like a great carpet of stars, or 
spearpoints in the gloom.” 

“Like sentinels,” said Hanley, 
“keeping eternal vigil in the 
night.” He wasn’t sure if the idea 
was his or if he was parroting 
a barely perceptible voice from 
the radio. 

“I often come here,” said the 
girl. 

“I never come here,” Hanley 
said. 

“But tonight . .” 

“Tonight I had to come. I knew 
I would find you.” 

Hanley felt that the Romance 
Service needed a better script 
writer. Such dialogue, in broad 
daylight, would be ridiculous. But 
now, on a high rooftop overlook- 
ing the city, with lights flashing 
below and the stars very close 
overhead, it was the most natural 
conversation in the world. 

“I do not encourage strangers,” 
said the girl, taking a step toward 
him. “But - ” 

“I am no stranger,” Hanley 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



said, moving toward her. 

The girl’s pale blonde hair 
glinted with starlight. Her lips 
parted. She looked at him, her 
features transfigured by the mood, 
the atmosphere and the soft, flat- 
tering light. 

They stood face to face and 
Hanley could smell her faint per- 
fume and the fragrance of her 
hair. His knees became weak and 
confusion reigned within him. 

“Take her in your arms,” the 
radio whispered. 

Automatonlike, Hanley held 
out his arms. The girl entered 
them with a little sigh. They 
kissed — simply, naturally, inevit- 
ably, and with a mounting and 
predictable passion. 

Then Hanley noticed the tiny 
jeweled transistor radio on the 
girl’s lapel. In spite of it, he had 
to admit that the meeting was 
not only spontaneous and fate- 
ful, but enormously pleasant as 
well. 

rjAWN was touching the sky- 
scrapers when Hanley re- 
turned to his apartment and 
tumbled, exhausted, into bed. He 
slept all day and awoke toward 
evening, ravenously hungry. He 
ate dinner in a neighborhood bar 
and considered the events of the 
previous night. 

It had been wild, perfect and 
wonderful, all of it — the meet- 
ing on the roof and, later, her 

GRAY FLANNEL ARMOR 



warm and darkened apartment; 
and at last his departure at dawn, 
with her drowsy kiss still warm 
on his mouth. But despite all 
this, Hanley was disturbed. 

He couldn’t help feeling a little 
odd about a romantic meeting set 
up and sponsored by transistor 
radios, which cued lovers into 
the proper spontaneous yet fated 
responses. It was undoubtedly 
clever but something about it 
seemed wrong. 

He visualized a million young 
men in gray flannel suits and 
striped regimental ties, roaming 
the streets of the city in response 
to the barely heard commands of 
a million tiny radios. He pictured 
the radio operators at their cen- 
tral two-way videophone switch- 
board-earnest, hard-working peo- 
ple, doing their night’s work at 
romance, then buying a news- 
paper and taking a subway home 
to the husband or wife and kids. 

This was distasteful. But he 
had to admit that it was better 
than no romance at all. These 
were modern times. Even ro- 
mance had to be put on a sound 
organizational basis or get lost 
in the shuffle. 

Besides, Hanley thought, was 
it really so strange? In medieval 
times, a witch gave a knight a 
charm, which led him to an en- 
chanted lady. Today, a salesman 
gave a man a transistor radio, 
which did the same thing and 

113 



probably a lot faster. 

Quite possibly, he thought, 
there has never been a truly spon- 
taneous and fated romance. Per- 
haps the thing always requires 
a middleman. 

Hanley cast further thoughts 
out of his mind. He paid for his 
dinner and went out for a walk. 

HP HIS time, his firm and hur- 
-*■ ried steps led him into a 
poorer section of the city. Here 
garbage cans lined the sidewalks, 
and from the dirty tenement win- 
dows came the sound of a melan- 
choly clarinet, and the shrill 
voices of women raised in argu- 
ment. A cat, striped and agate- 
eyed, peered at him from an al- 
leyway and darted out of sight. 

Hanley shivered, stopped, and 
decided to return to his own part 
of the city. 

“Why not walk on?” the radio 
urged him, speaking very softly, 
like a voice in his head. 

Hanley shivered again and 
walked on. 

The streets were deserted now 
and silent as a tomb. Hanley hur- 
ried past gigantic windowless 
warehouses and shuttered stores. 
Some adventures, it seemed to 
him, were not worth the taking. 
This was hardly a suitable locale 
for romance. Maybe he should 
ignore the radio and return to 
the bright, well-ordered world 
he knew — 

114 



He heard a sound of scuffling 
feet. Glancing down a narrow al- 
ley, he saw three wrestling figures. 
Two were men and the third, try- 
ing to break free, was a girl. 

Hanley’s reaction was instan- 
taneous. He tensed to sprint away 
and find a policeman, preferably 
two or three. But the radio 
stopped him. 

“You can handle them,” the 
radio said. 

Like hell I can, Hanley 
thought. The newspapers were 
full of stories about men who 
thought they could handle mug- 
gers. They usually had plenty of 
time to brood over their fistic 
shortcomings in a hospital. 

But the radio urged him on. 
And touched by a sense of des- 
tiny, moved by the girl’s plaintive 
cries, Hanley removed his horn- 
rimmed glasses, put them in their 
case, put the case into a hip 
pocket, and plunged into the 
black maw of the alley. 

He ran full into a garbage can, 
knocked it over and reached the 
struggling group. The muggers 
hadn’t noticed him yet. Hanley 
seized one by the shoulder, 
turned him and lashed out with 
his right fist. The man staggered 
back against the wall. His friend 
released the girl and went for 
Hanley, who struck out with both 
hands and his right foot. 

The man went down, grum- 
bling, “Take it easy, buddy.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Hanley turned back to the first 
mugger, who came at him like 
a wildcat. Surprisingly, the man’s 
entire fusillade of blows missed 
and Hanley knocked him down 
with a single well-placed left. 

The two men scrambled to 
their feet and fled. As they ran, 
Hanley could hear one complain 
to the other, “Ain’t this a hell of 
a way to make a living?” 

Ignoring this break in the 
script, Hanley turned to the girl. 

She leaned against him for sup- 
port. “You came,” she breathed. 

“I had to,” said Hanley, in 
response to a barely audible radio 
voice. 

“I know,” she murmured. 

Hanley saw that she was young 
and lovely. Her black hair glinted 
with lamplight. Her lips parted. 
She looked at him, her features 
transfigured by the mood, the 
atmosphere and the soft, flatter- 
ing light. 

This time, Hanley needed no 
command from the tiny radio to 
take her into his arms. He was 
learning the form and content of 
the romantic adventure and the 
proper manner of conducting a 
spontaneous yet fated affair. 

They departed at once for her 
apartment. And as they walked, 
Hanley noticed a large jewel glit- 
tering in her black hair. 

It wasn’t until much later that 
he realized it was a tiny, artful- 
ly disguised transistor radio. 

CRAY FLANNEL ARMOR 



N EXT evening, Hanley was out 
again, walking the streets 
and trying to quiet a small voice 
of dissatisfaction within him. It 
had been a perfect night, he re- 
minded himself, a night of ten- 
der shadows, soft hair brushing 
his eyes and tears warm upon 
his shoulder. And yet . 

The sad fact remained that 
this girl hadn’t been his type, 
any more than the first girl had 
been. You simply can’t throw 
strangers together at random and 
expect the fiery, quick romance 
to turn into love. Love has its 
own rules and enforces them 
rigidly. 

So Hanley walked, and the 
conviction grew within him that 
tonight he was going to find love. 
For tonight the horned moon 
hung low over the city and a 
southern breeze carried the 
mingled scent of spice and nos- 
talgia. 

Aimlessly he wandered, for his 
transistor radio was silent. No 
command brought him to the lit- 
tle park at the river’s edge and 
no secret voice urged him to ap- 
proach the solitary girl standing 
there. 

He stood near her and con- 
templated the scene. To his left 
was a great bridge, its girders 
faint and spidery in the dark- 
ness. The river’s oily black water 
slid past, ceaselessly twisting and 
turning. A tug hooted and another 

115 



replied, wailing like ghosts lost 
in the night. 

His radio gave him no hint. 
So Hanley said, “Nice night.” 

“Maybe,” said the girl, not 
turning. “Maybe not.” 

“The beauty is there,” Hanley 
said, “if you care to see it.” 

“What a strange thing to 
say . .” 

“Is it?” Hanley asked, taking 
a step toward her. “Is it really 
strange? Is it strange that I’m 
here? And that you are here?” 

“Perhaps not,” the girl said, 
turning at last and looking into 
Hanley’s face. 

She was young and lovely. Her 
bronze hair glinted with moon- 
light and her features were trans- 
figured by the mood, the atmos- 
phere and the soft, flattering 
light. 

Her lips parted in wonder. 

And then Hanley knew. 

T^HIS adventure was truly 
fated and spontaneous! The 
radio had not guided him to this 
place, had not whispered cues 
and responses for him to mur- 
mur. And looking at the girl, Han- 
ley could see no tiny transistor 
radio on her blouse or in her hair. 

He had met his love, without 
assistance from the New York 
Romance Service! At last, his 
dark and fitful visions were com- 
ing true. 

He held out his arms. With the 



faintest sigh, she came into them. 
They kissed, while the lights of 
the city flashed and mingled with 
the stars overhead, and the cres- 
cent moon dipped in the sky, and 
foghorns hooted mournful mes- 
sages across the oily black river. 

Breathlessly, the girl stepped 
back. “Do you like me?” she 
asked. 

“Like you!” exclaimed Hanley. 
“Let me tell you — ” 

“I’m so glad,” said the girl, “be- 
cause I am your Free Introduc- 
tory Romance, given as a sample 
by Greater Romance Industries, 
with home offices in Newark, New 
Jersey. Only our firm offers ro- 
mances which are truly spon- 
taneous and fated. Due to our 
technological researches, we are 
able to dispense with such clumsy 
apparatus as transistor radios, 
which lend an air of rigidity and 
control where no control should 
be apparent. We are happy to 
have been able to please you 
with this sample romance. 

“But remember — this is only 
a sample, a taste, of what Greater 
Romance Industries, with branch 
offices all over the world, can 
offer you. In this brochure, sir, 
several plans are outlined. You 
might be interested in the Ro- 
mance in Many Lands package,

imagination, perhaps the piquant

age is for you. Then there is the

regular City Plan and — ” 

She slipped a brightly illus- 
trated pamphlet into Hanley’s 
hand. Hanley stared at it, then 
at her. His fingers opened and 
the brochure fluttered to the 
ground. 

“Sir! I trust we haven’t of- 
fended you!” the girl cried. 
“These businesslike aspects of 
romance are necessary, but quick- 
ly over. Then everything is pure- 
ly spontaneous and fateful. You 
receive your bill each month in 
a plain, unmarked envelope 
and — ” 

But Hanley had turned from 
her and was running down the 
street. As he ran, he plucked the 
tiny transistor radio from his 
lapel and hurled it into a gutter. 

T^URTHER attempts at sales- 
■P* manship were wasted on 
Hanley. He telephoned an aunt 
of his, who immediately and with 
twittering excitement arranged a 
date for him with a daughter of 
one of her oldest friends. They 
met in his aunt’s overdecorated 
parlor and talked in halting sen- 
tences for three hours, about the 
weather, college, business, poli- 
tics, and friends they might have 
in common. And Hanley’s beam- 
ing aunt hurried in and out of 



the brightly lighted room, serv- 
ing coffee and homemade cake. 

Something about this stiff, for- 
mal, anachronistic setup must 
have been peculiarly right for the 
two young people. They pro- 
gressed to regular dates and were 
married after a courtship of three 
months. 

It is interesting to note that 
Hanley was among the last to 
find a wife in the old, unsure, 
quaint, haphazard, unindustrial- 
ized fashion. For the Service 
Companies saw at once the com- 
mercial potentialities of Hanley’s 
Mode, graphed the effects of em- 
barrassment upon the psyche, 
and even assessed the role of the 
Aunt in American Courtship. 

And now one of the Companies’ 
regular and most valued services 
is to provide bonded aunts for 
young men to call up, to provide 
these hunts with shy and embar- 
rassed young girls, and to pro- 
duce a proper milieu for all this 
in the form of a bright, over- 
decorated parlor, an uncomfort- 
able couch, and an eager old lady 
bustling back and forth at meticu- 
lously unexpected intervals with 
coffee and homemade cake. 

The suspense, they say, be- 
comes almost overpowering.

HIS MONKEY WIFE by John 
Collier. Doubleday & Co., Inc., 
N. Y. $3.75 

HP HOUGH it starts out seeming- 
-*■ ly as a gag, Collier’s first novel 
takes on more and more a straight 
face until, at the denouement, the 
reader is quasi-or possibly queasy- 
convinced that Collier is speaking 
his true mind. In any event, we 
owe a debt to Doubleday for bring- 
ing back this book, first published 
in 1931. 

An English missionary, accret- 
ing a dowry in the African jungle 

118 



for his reluctant bride-to-be back 
home, has adopted a female chim- 
panzee as pet, not knowing that 
she is most extraordinary. She has 
taught herself to read, but her at- 
tempt to learn writing in her mas- 
ter’s native school led to a trau- 
matic experience from which her 
self-confidence never recovered. 

Returning to civilization after 
five years to prepare for his com- 
ing nuptials, her master takes her 
with him. Unfortunately, she has 
fallen in love with him and has 
correctly estimated the falsity of 
his beloved’s affection. It isn’t for

human rival. Just see for yourself! 

THE HUNGER AND OTHER 
STORIES by Charles Beaumont. 
G. P. Putnam’s Sons, N. Y., $3.50 

T>EAUMONT is one of the ris- 
ing stars in the newer group of 
solid talents. In this, his first col- 
lection, only “The Crooked Man” 
is S-F, the rest fantasy or straight 
fiction. “Black Country” is a tower- 
ing horror story of a Negro jazz 
ensemble. There are several other 
striking yarns— “Miss Gentilbelle” 
and “Last Night The Rain” are a 
couple that you won’t soon forget. 

EASTER ISLAND by Alfred 
Metraux. Oxford University Press, 
N. Y., $5.00 

T TNFORTUNATELY for an 
entire school of writers, most 
authorities are now in agreement 
that the famous monoliths of 
Easter Island are not relics of the 
inundation of the lost continent, 
Mu. There is disagreement as to 
who did erect the monuments, but 
virtually none concerning their 
proper age, which is measured in 
mere hundreds of years. 

Dr. Metraux, an anthropologist, 
spent a half year on the island 
with the intent of proving that the 
ancestors of the present inhabitants 
were the mysterious sculptors. This 
he did to his own and, possibly, 



your satisfaction. To him, the 
amazing thing is that such a tiny, 
poverty-stricken community could 
build monuments worthy of a great 
and wealthy nation. 

SOMETIME, NEVER by Wil- 
liam Golding, John Wyndham, 
Mervyn Peake. Ballantine Books, 
N. Y„ $2.00 

T HIS group of novellas by three 
topflight English authors is as 
exciting as a letter from the future. 

Golding is the author of last 
year’s marvelously off-trail novel, 
Lord of the Flies. His story of the 
past, “Envoy Extraordinary,” is a 
glittering writing job concerning a 
barbaric genius and the inventions 
he offers to a cagy old Caesar. The 
Emperor, a wise ruler holding 
power tenaciously through wile 
rather than force, can see the ad- 
vantages, but also, shrewd man, 
the disadvantages. Which makes 
an amusing story of power poli- 
tics, subtle counter-measures and 
a surprise ending. 

Wyndham’s “Consider Her 
Ways” is a well-done variation of 
the old human-hive, queen-bee 
yarn in which males have become 
extinct. A workmanlike job, but 
without the smashing impact of 
the Golding or “Boy in Darkness” 
by Mervyn Peake. 

The latter is a nightmarish story 
of such unique quality that I find 
it hard to believe that no American

COLONIAL SURVEY by Mur- 
ray Leinster. Gnome Press, Inc., 
N. Y., $3.00 

rpUE years may pass and the 
-®- names of the S-F greats may 
change, but Leinster, bless him, 
makes like Ol’ Man Ribber. His 
current “novel,” a somewhat dis- 
jointed collection of four separate 
tales with common hero from ASF, 
is the gadget story raised to new 
heights. 

Basically, this is the type of 
yarn that flourished during the 
First Decade. Leinster’s flesh-and- 
blood humans make an interesting 
contrast to, for instance, Arcot, 
Wade and Morey, three of the 
greatest gadgeteers. Leinster pulls 
his miracles out of a hat labeled 
Deus ex perspiration and makes 
them completely credible. First 
rate. 

THE 27th DAY by John Mant- 
ley. E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc., N. Y ., 
$3.50 

r | 'HE premise of this book makes 
difficult swallowing. As in 
Clarke’s Childhood’s End, we are 
contacted by an infinitely superior 
race. However, their function is 
not nursemaid but sowers of de- 
structive seed. Their home sun is 

120 



going Nova momentarily, but ow- 
ing to their ethical standards, they 
cannot arbitrarily expropriate an 
inhabited planet. They have se- 
lected five persons of different na- 
tionalities, snatched them to their 
craft and presented each with a 
kit containing golden pellets of 
enormous destructive potential. If 
Earth has not destroyed two- 
thirds of its population in 27 days 
(note title), the Invaders will 
leave. The kits are attuned to the 
minds of their bearers and cannot 
be opened by others. 

The five — American, English 
girl, Chinese ditto, Russian soldier 
and German scientist— make a mu- 
tual pact not to disclose the secret 
of their kits. Things, of course, are 
not that simple. After all, this is 
a yarn about Super-Dupers. 

QUEST FOR A CONTINENT 
by Walter Sullivan. McGraw-Hill, 
N. Y., Toronto, London, $5,50 

D ECAUSE of Admiral Byrd’s 
death this past March and 
the imminent Geophysical Year, 
Antarctica is right up there in gen- 
eral interest. For those who would 
like to bone up on the frigid con- 
tinent’s history, Sullivan’s book is 
as good an encyclopedia as can be 
found. In important addition, it 
reads like a novel. 

The author has humanized the 
gigantic mass of cold data to the 
point that his reader is right there 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



when the helpless Oates of Scott’s 
doomed expedition, hands and feet 
frozen, sacrificed himself with the 
words, “I am just going outside 
and may be some time.” Or the 
heart-rending final entries of Rob- 
ert Scott: “It seems a pity, but I 
do not think I can write more.” 

You may manage to tear your- 
self away from Sullivan’s book, 
but not easily. 

HOW LIFE BEGAN by Irving 
Adler. The John Day Co., N. Y., 
$2.95 

A SIDE from the cosmic ques- 
tion of the origin of the Uni- 
verse itself, perhaps the most fun- 
damental problem Man has faced 
has been that of his own origin. 
That, of course, is of a piece with 
the problem of the source of Life 
itself. Adler’s book is a step-by- 
step demonstration of how simple 
molecules can become complex, 
like the protein molecules, the 
smallest known being as heavy as 
13,000 hydrogen atoms and the 
largest known as heavy as some 
10,000,000 hydrogen atoms. 

The basic secret of life is the 
ability of the carbon atom to com- 
bine with other elements. The 



reader, who needs no special 
knowledge to enjoy this text, will 
be astounded to learn that, ac- 
cording to Adler, life on this planet 
was inevitable!

By JIM HARMON 



The man worth while couldn't be allowed to 
smile ... if he ever laughed at himself, the 
entire ship and crew were as good as dead! 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 




122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




I F THERE is anything I am 
afraid of, and there probably 
is, it is having a rookie Ac- 
cident Prone, half-starved from 
the unemployment lines, aboard 
my spaceship. They are always 
so anxious to please. They re- 
member what it is like to live in 



a rathole behind an apartment 
house furnace eating day-old 
bread and wilted vegetables, 
which doesn’t compare favorably 
to the Admiralty-style state- 
rooms and steak and caviar they 
draw down in the Exploration 
Service. 



BREAK A LEG 



123 




You may wonder why anybody 
should make things so pleasant 
for a grownup who can’t walk a 
city block without tripping over 
his own feet and who has a very 
low life expectancy on Earth due 
to the automobiles they are con- 
stantly stepping in front of and 
the live wires they are fond of 
picking up so the street won’t 
be littered. 

The Admiralty, however, is a 
very thorough group of men. Be- 
fore they open a planet to coloni- 
zation or even fraternization, they 
insist on knowing just what they 
are up against. 

Accident Prones can find out 
what is wrong with a planet as 
easily as falling off a log, which 
they will if there is one lonely 
tree on the whole world. A single 
pit of quicksand on a veritable 
Eden of a planet and a Prone 
will be knee-deep in it within an 
hour of blastdown. If an alien 
race will smile patronizingly on 
your heroic attempts at geno- 
cide, but be offended into a mur- 
derous religious frenzy if you 
blow your nose, you can take the 
long end of the odds that the 
Prone will almost immediately 
catch a cold. 

All of this is properly recorded 
for the next expedition in the Ad- 
miralty files, and if it’s any con- 
solation, high officials and screen 
stars often visit you in the hos- 
pital. 

124 



C HARLIE Baxter was like all 
of the other Prones, only 
worse. Moran III was sort of an 
unofficial test for him and he 
wanted to make good. We had 
blasted down in the black of night 
and were waiting for daylight to 
begin our re-survey of the planet. 
It was Charlie’s first assignment, 
so we had an easy one — just see- 
ing if anything new had devel- 
oped in the last fifty years. 

Baxter’s guard was doubled as 
soon as we set down, of course, 
and that made him fidgety. He 
had heard all the stories about 
how high the casualty rate was 
with Prones aboard spaceships 
and now he was beginning to get 
nervous. 

Actually Charlie was safer in 
space than he would be back on 
Earth with all those cars and 
people. We could have told him 
how the Service practically never 
lost a Prone— they were too valu- 
able and rare to lose — but we 
did not want him to stop worry- 
ing. The precautions we took to 
safeguard him, the armed men 
who went with him everywhere, 
the Accident Prone First Aid Kit 
with spare parts for him, blood, 
eyes, bone, nerves, arms, legs, 
and so forth, only emphasized to 
him the danger, not the rigidly 
secured safety. 

We like it that way. 

No one knows what causes an 
accident prone. The big insurance 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



companies on Earth discovered 
them when they found out in the 
last part of the nineteenth cen- 
tury that ninety per cent of the 
accidents were happening to a 
few per cent of the people. They 
soon found out that these people 
were not malingering or trying to 
defraud anybody; they simply 
had accidents. 

I suppose everything from psy- 
chology to extra-sensory percep- 
tion has been used to explain or 
explain away prones. I have my 
own ideas. I think an accident 
prone is simply a super-genius 
with a super-doubt of himself. 

I believe accident prones have 
a better system of calculation 
than a cybernetic machine. They 
can take everything into consid- 
eration — the humidity, their 
blood sugar, the expression on the 
other guy’s face — and somewhere 
in the corners and attic of their 
brain they infallibly make the 
right choice in any given situa- 
tion. Then, because they are in- 
capable of trusting themselves, 
they do exactly the opposite. 

I felt a little sorry for Charlie 
Baxter, but I was Captain of the 
Hilliard and my job was to keep 
him worried and trying. The 
worst thing that can happen is 
for a Prone to give up and let 
himself sink into the fate of be- 
ing a Prone. He will wear the rut 
right down into a tomb. 

Accident Prones have to stay 



worried and thinking, trying to 
break out of the jinx that traps 

them. Usually they come to dis- 
cover this themselves, but by 

then, if they are real professionals 
with a career in the Service, they 
have framed the right attitude 
and they keep it. 

TJAXTER was a novice and 
very much of an amateur 
at the game. He didn’t like the 
scoring system, but he was at- 
tached to the equipment and 
didn’t want to lose it. 

His clumsiness back on Earth 
had cost him every decent job 
he ever had. He had come all 
the way down the line until he 
was rated eligible only for the 
position of Prone aboard a space- 
ship. He had been poor — hungry, 
cold, wet, poor — and now he had 
luxury of a kind almost no one 
had in our era. He was drunk 
with it, passionately in love with 
it. It would cease to be quite so 
important after a few years of 
regular food, clean clothes and a 
solid roof to keep out the rain. 
But right now I knew he would 
come precariously close to killing 
to keep it. Or to being killed. 

He was ready to work. 

I knocked politely on his hatch 
and straightened my tunic. I have 
always admired the men who can 
look starched in a uniform. Mine 
always seemed to wrinkle as soon 
as I put them around my raw- 



BREAK A LEG 



125 



boned frame. Sometimes it is 
hard for me to keep a military 
appearance or manner. I got my 
commission during the Crisis ten 
years back, because of my work 
in the reserve unit that I created 
out of my employees in the glass 
works (glassware blown to order 
for laboratories). 

Someone said something 
through the door and I went in- 
side. 

Bronoski looked at me over 
the top of his picture tape from 
where he lay on the sofa. No 
one else was in the compartment. 

“Where is Baxter?” I asked the 
hulking guard. My eyes were on 
the sofa. My own bed pulled out 
of the wall and was considerably 
inferior to this, much less Baxter’s 
bed in the next cabin. But then 
I am only a captain. 

Bronoski swung his feet off the 
couch and stood more or less in 
what I might have taken for at- 
tention if I hadn’t known him bet- 
ter. “Sidney and Elliot escorted 
him down to the men’s room, 
Captain Jackson.” 

“You mean,” I said very quiet- 
ly, “that he isn’t in his own bath?” 
“No sir,” Bronoski said wearily. 
“He told us it was out of order.” 
I stifled the gurgle of rage that 
came into my throat and mo- 
tioned Bronoski to follow me. 
The engines on the Hilliard were 
more likely to be out of order 
than the plumbing in the Acci- 

126 



dent Prone’s suite. No effort was 
spared to insure comfort for the 
key man in the whole crew. 

One glance inside the compart- 
ment at the end of the corridor 
satisfied me. There wasn’t a thing 
wrong with the plumbing, so Bax- 
ter must have had something in 
mind. 

On a hunch of my own, I 
checked the supply lockers next 
to the airlock while Bronoski 
fired questions at my back. Three 
translator collars were missing. 
Baxter had left the spaceship 
and gone off into an alien night. 

Elliot and Sidney, the guards, 
were absolutely prohibited from 
interfering in any way with a 
Prone’s decisions. They merely 
had to follow him and give their 
lives to save his, if necessary. 

I grabbed up a translator col- 
lar and tossed one to Bronoski. 
Then, just as we were getting 
into the airlock, I remembered 
something and ran back to the 
bridge. 

The thick brown envelope I 
had left on my desk was gone. 
I had shown it to Baxter and in- 
formed him that he should study 
it when he felt so inclined. He 
has seemed bored with the idea 
then, but he had come back for the 
report before leaving the ship. 
The envelope contained the ex- 
ploration survey on Moran III 
made some fifty years before. 

I unlocked a desk drawer with 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



my thumb print and drew out a 
duplicate of the report. I didn’t 
have too much confidence in it 
and I hoped Charlie Baxter had 
less. Lots of things can change 
on a planet in fifty years, includ- 
ing its inhabitants. 

T>RONOSKI picked up Bax- 
ter’s tracks and those of the 
two guards, Elliot and Sidney, 
with ultra-violet light. They were 
cold splotches of green fire 
against the rotting black peat of 
the jungle path. The whole dark, 
tangled mess smelled of sour 
mash, an intoxicating bourbon- 
type aroma. 

I jogged along following the 
big man more by instinct than 
anything else, ruining my eyes in 
an effort to refresh my memory 
as to the contents of the survey 
report in the cheery little glow 
from my cigarette lighter. 

The lighter was beginning to 
feel hot to my fingers and I 
started to worry about radiation 
leak, although they are supposed 
to be guaranteed perfectly 
shielded. I read that before the 
last exploration party had left, 
they had made the Moranite 
natives blood brothers. Then Bro- 
noski knocked me down. 

Actually he put his hands in 
the small of my back and shoved 
politely but firmly. Just the same, 
I went face down into the moist 
dirt fast enough. 



I raised my head cautiously to 
see if Bronoski would shov§ it 
back down. He didn’t. 

I could see through the stringy, 
alcoholic grass fairly well and 
there were Baxter, Elliot and Sid- 
ney in the middle of a curious 
mob of aliens. 

Charlie Baxter had got pretty 
thin on his starvation diet back 
on Earth. He had grown a slight 
pot belly on the good food he 
drew down as Prone, but he was 
a fairly nice-looking young fel- 
low. He looked even better in 
the pale moonlight, mixed amber 
and chartreuse from the twin 
satellites, and in contrast to the 
rest of the group. 

Elliot Charterson and Sidney 
Von Elderman were more or less 
type-cast as brawny, brainless 
bodyguards. Their friends de- 
scribed them as muscle-bound 
apes, but other people sometimes 
got insulting. 

The natives were less formid- 
able. They made the slight lump 
of fat Charlie had at his waist 
look positively indecent. 

The natives were skinny. How 
skinny? Well, the only curves 
they had in their bodies were 
their bulging eyeballs. But just 
because they were thin didn’t 
mean they were pushovers. Whips 
and garrotes aren’t fat and these 
looked just as dangerous. 

Whenever I see aliens who are 
so humanoid, I remember all that 



BREAK A LEG 



127 



Sunday supplement stuff about 
the Galaxy being colonized some- 
time by one humanlike race and 
the Ten Lost Tribes and so forth. 

They didn’t give me much time 
to think about it just then. The 
natives looked unhappy — bel- 
ligerently unhappy. 

I began to shake and at the 
same time to assure myself that 
I didn’t have anything to worry 
about, that the precious Accident 
Prone would come out of it alive. 
After all, Elliot and Sidney were 
there to protect him. They had 
machine guns, flame-throwers, 
atomic grenades, and some really 
potent weapons. They could 
handle the situation. I didn’t have 
a thing to worry about. 

So why couldn’t I stop shak- 
ing? 

Maybe it was the way the na- 
tives were slowly but deliberate- 
ly forming a circle about Charlie 
and his bodyguards. 

T^HE clothing of the Moranites 
hadn’t changed much, I no- 
ticed. That was understandable. 
They had a non-mechanical civi- 
lization with scattered colonies 
that it would take a terrestrial 
season to tour by animal cart. 

An isolated culture like that 
couldn’t change many of its cus- 
toms. Then Charlie shouldn’t 
have any trouble if he stuck to 
the findings on behavior in the 
report. Naturally, that meant by 

128 



now he had discovered the fatal 
error. 

The three men were just stand- 
ing still, waiting for the aliens 
to make the first move. The na- 
tives looked just as worried as 
Charlie and his guards, but then 
that might have been their 
natural expression. 

I jumped a little when the 
natives all began to talk at once. 
The mixture of sound was fed 
to me through my translator col- 
lar while the cybernetic unit back 
on board the spaceship tried de- 
coding the words. It was too much 
of an overload and, infuriatingly, 
the sound was cut out altogether. 
I started to rip my collar off when 
the natives stopped screeching 
and a spokesman stepped for- 
ward. 

The native slumped a little 
more than the others, as if he 
were more relaxed, and his eyes 
didn’t goggle so much. He said, 
“We do not understand,” and the 
translation came through fine. 

Baxter swallowed and started 
forward to meet the alien half- 
way. His boot slipped on the wet 
scrub grass and I saw him do the 
desperate little dance to regain 
his balance that I had seen him 
make so many times; he could 
never stay on his feet. 

Before he could perform his 
usual pratfall, Sidney and Elliot 
were at his sides, supporting him 
by his thin biceps. He glared at 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



them and shrugged them off, in- 
forming them wordlessly that he 
would have regained his balance 
if they had given him half a 
chance. 

“We do not understand,” the 
native repeated. “Do you hold us 
in so much contempt as to claim 
all of us as your brothers?” 

“All beings are brothers,” Char- 
lie said. “We were made blood 
brothers by your people and my 
people several hundred of your 
years ago.” 

Charlie’s words were being 
translated into the native lan- 
guage, of course, but Bronoski’s 
collars and mine switched them 
back into Terrestrial. I’ve read 
stories where explorers wearing 
translators couldn’t understand 
each other, but that isn’t the way 
it works. If you listen closely, 
you make out the words in your 
own language underneath, and if 
you pay very close attention, you 
can find minor sematic differences 
in the original words and the 
echo translated back from a na- 
tive language. 

I was trying to catch both ver- 
sions from Charlie. I knew he 
was making a mistake and later 
I wanted to be sure I knew just 
what it was. Frankly, I would 
have used the blood-brother gam- 
bit myself. I had also read about 
it in the survey report, as I made 
a point of telling you. This just 
proves that Accident Prones 



haven’t secured the franchise on 
mistakes. The difference is that 
I would have gone about it a lot 
more cautiously. 

“Enough of this,” the native 
said sharply. “Do you claim to 
be my brother?” 

“Sure,” Charlie said. 

Dispassionately but automati- 
cally, the alien launched himself 
at the Prone’s throat. 

i^HARTERSON and Von El- 
^ derman instantly went into 
action. Elliot Charterson jumped 
to Charlie’s assistance while Sid- 
ney Von Elderman swung around 
to protect Charlie from the rest 
of the crowd. 

But the defense didn’t work. 

The other aliens didn’t try to 
get to Baxter, but when they saw 
Elliot start to interfere with the 
two writhing opponents, they 
clawed him down into the grass. 
Sidney had been set to defend the 
Prone, not his fellow guard. They 
might have been all right if he 
had pulled a few off Elliot and 
let him get to work, except his 
training told him that the life 
of a guard did not matter a 
twit, but that a Prone must be 
defended. He started toward 
Charlie Baxter and was imme- 
diately pulled down by a spare 
dozen of the mob. 

It all meant one thing to me. 
The reaction of the crowd had 
been spontaneous, not planned.

That meant that the struggle 
between Charlie and the spokes- 
man was a high order of single 
combat with which it was unholy, 
indecent and dastardly to inter- 
fere. 

I could fairly hear Bronoski’s 
steel muscles preparing for battle 
as he saw his two mammoth pals 
go down under the press of num- 
bers. A bristle-covered bullet of 
skull rose out of the grass be- 
side me and it was my turn to 
grind his face in the muck. 

I had a nice little problem to 
contend with. 

I knew the reason Baxter had 
slipped out at night to be the 
first to greet the aliens. He was 
determined to be useful and nec- 
essary without fouling things up. 
I suppose Charlie had never felt 
valuable to anyone before in his 
life, but at the same time it hurt 
him to think that he was valuable 
only because he was a misfit. 

He had decided to take a posi- 
tive approach. If he did things 
right, that would be as good proof 
of conditions as if he made the 
mistakes he was supposed to do. 
But he couldn’t lick that doubt 
of himself that had been ground 
into him since birth and there he 
was, in trouble as always. 

Now maybe Bronoski and I 
could get him out ourselves by a 
direct approach, but Charlie 
would probably lose all self-con- 
fidence and sink down into ac- 



cepting himself as an Accident 
Prone, a purely passive state. 

We couldn’t have that. We had 
to have Charlie acting and think- 
ing and therefore making mis- 
takes whose bad examples we 
could profit by. 

As I lay on my belly thinking, 
Charlie was putting up a pretty 
good fight with the stringy na- 
tive. He got in a few good 
punches, which seemed to mystify 
the native, who apparently knew 
nothing of boxing. Naturally 
Charlie then began wrestling a 
trained and deadly wrestler in- 
stead of continuing to box him. 

I grabbed Bronoski by his puf- 
fy ear and hissed some commands 
into it. He fumbled out a book of 
matches and lit one for me. By 
the tiny flicker of light, I began 
tearing apart my lighter. 

T SUPPOSE you have played 
“tickling the dragon’s tail” 
when you were a kid. I did. I 
guess all kids have. You know, 
worrying around two lumps of fis- 
sionable material and just keep- 
ing them from uniting and mak- 
ing a critical mass that will re- 
sult in an explosion or lethal 
radiation. I caught my oldest boy 
doing it one day back on Earth 
and gave him a good tanning for 
it. Actually I thought it showed 
he had a lot of grit. Every real 
boy likes to tickle the dragon’s 
tail.

Maybe I was a little old for it, 
but that’s what I was doing there 
in the Moran III jungle. 

I got the shield off my cigarette 
lighter and jerked out the dinky 
little damper rods for the pile 
and started easing the two little 
bricks toward each other with 
the point of my lead pencil. 

I heard something that re- 
sembled a death rattle come from 
Charlie’s throat as the fingers of 
the alien closed down on it and 
my hand twitched. A blooming 
light stabbed at my eyes and I 
flicked the lighter away from me. 

The explosion was a dud. 

It lit up the jungle for a radius 
of half a mile like a giant flash- 
bulb, but it exploded only about 
ten times as loud as a pistol shot. 
The mass hadn’t been slapped to- 
gether hard enough or held long 
enough to do any real damage. 

The natives weren’t fools, 
though. They got out of there 
fast. I wished I could have gone 
with them. There was undoubted- 
ly an unhealthy amount of radia- 
tion hanging around. 

“Now!” I told Bronoski. 

He ran into the clearing and 
found four bodies sprawled out: 
Charlie Baxter, his two guards 
and the native spokesman. 

Charlie and the native were 
both technically unconscious, but 
they each had a stranglehold on 
each other, with Charlie getting 
the worst of it. 



Bronoski pried the two of them 
apart. 

While he roused Sidney and 
Elliot from their punch-drunk 
state, I examined Charlie. He had 
a nasty burn on his leg and two 
toes were gone. If there was an 
explosion anywhere around, he 
was bound to be in front of it. 

He was abruptly choking and 
blinking watery eyes. 

“You did it, Charlie,” I lied. 
“You beat him fair and square.” 

i^HARLIE was in bed for the 
next few days while his 
grafted toes grew on, but he 
didn’t seem to mind. 

We knew enough not to use 
the blood-brothers approach after 
fifty years and therefore it did not 
take us long to find out why we 
shouldn’t. 

The Moran III culture was iso- 
lated in small colonies, but we 
had forgotten that a generation 
of the intelligent life-forms was 
only three Earth months. It seems 
a waste at first thought, but all 
things are relative. The Crysto- 
peds of New Lichtenstein, for in- 
stance, have a life span of twen- 
ty thousand Terrestrial years. 

With so fast a turnover in 
Moran III individuals, there was 
bound to be a lot of variables in- 
troduced, resulting in change. 

The idea that seemed to be in 
favor was the survival of the fit- 
test. Since the natives were born 



BREAK A LEG 



131 



in litters, with single births ex- 
tremely rare, this concept was 
practiced from the first. Unless 
they were particularly cunning, 
the runts of the litter did not sur- 
vive the first year and rarely 
more than one sibling ever saw 
adulthood. 

Obviously, to claim to be a 
native’s brother was to challenge 
him to a test of survival. 

My men learned to call them- 
selves Last Brother in the usual 
bragging preliminaries that pre- 
ceded every encounter. We got 
pretty good results with that ap- 
proach and learned a lot about 
the changes in customs in the 
half century. But finally one of 
the men — either Frank Peir- 
monte or Sidney Charterson, who 
both claim to be the one— thought 
of calling the crew a Family and 
right away we began hitting it off 
famously. 

The Moranites figured we 
would kill each other off all ex- 
cept maybe one, whom they could 
handle themselves. They still had 
folk legends about the previous 
visit of Earthmen and they didn’t 
trust us. 

Charlie Baxter’s original mis- 
take had supplied us with the 
Rosetta Stone we needed. 

Doctor Selby told me Charlie 
could get up finally, so I went to 
his suite and shook hands with 
him as he still lay in bed. 

I waited for the big moment 

132 



when Charlie would be on his feet 
again and we could get on with 
the re-survey of the planet. 

“Here goes,” Charlie said and 
threw back his sheet. 

He swung his legs around and 
tottered to his feet. He was a lit- 
tle weak, but he took a few steps 
and seemed to make it okay. 

Then the inevitable happened. 
He snagged the edge of one of 
the Persian carpets on the bed- 
room floor with his big toe and 
started to fall. 

Selby and I both dived for- 
ward to catch him, but instead of 
doing the arm-waving dance for 
balance that we were both used 
to, he seemed to go limp and he 
plopped on the floor like a wet 
fish. 

Immediately he jumped to his 
feet, grinning. “I finally learned 
to go limp when I take a fall, sir. 
It took a lot of practice. I imagine 
I’ll save some broken bones that 
way.” 

“Yes,” I said uneasily. “You 
have been thinking about this 
quite a lot while you lay there, 
haven’t you, Baxter?” 

“Yes, sir. I see I’ve been fight- 
ing this thing too hard. I am an 
Accident Prone and I might as 
well accept it. Why not? I seem 
to always muddle through some 
way, like out there in the jungle, 
so why should I worry or feel 
embarrassed? I know I can’t change 
it.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



¥ WAS beginning to do some 

worrying of my own. Things 
weren’t working out the way they 
should. We were supposed to see 
that Prones kept developing a 
certain amount of doomed self- 
confidence, but they couldn’t be 
allowed to believe they were in- 
fallible Prones. A Prone’s value 
lies in his active and constructive 
effort to do the right thing. If 
he merely accepts being a Prone, 
his accidents gain us nothing. We 
can’t profit from mistakes that 
come about from resignation or 
laughing off blunders or, as in this 
case, conviction that he never 
got himself into anything he 
couldn’t get himself out of. 

“Doctor Selby, would you ex- 
cuse us?” I asked. 

The medic left with a bow and 
a surly expression. I turned to 
Baxter, rather wishing Selby 
could have stayed. It was a labor 
dispute and I was used to having 
a mediator present at bargaining 
sessions at my glassworks. But 
this was a military, not a civilian, 
spaceship. 

“I have some facts of life to 
give you, Baxter,” I told him. 
“It is your duty to actively ful- 
fill your position. You have to 
make decisions and plan courses 
of action. Do you figure on just 
walking around in that jungle 
until a tree falls on you?” 

He sat down on the edge of 
the bed and examined the pat- 



tern in the carpet. “Not exactly, 
sir. But I get tired of people wait-* 
ing for me to make a fool out of 
myself. I have a natural talent 
for — for Creative Negativism. 
That’s it. And I should be able 
to exercise my talent with dig- 
nity.” 

“If you don’t actively fulfill the 
obligations of a Prone, you aren’t 
allowed the luxuries and privi- 
leges that go with the position. 
Do you think you would like to 
be without your armed guards to 
protect you every moment?” 

“I can take care of myself, sir!” 

I paused and came up with my 
best argument. “How would you 
like to live like an ordinary 
spaceman, without rare steaks 
and clean sheets? Because if 
you’re not our Accident Prone, 
you’re just another crew member, 
you know.” 

That one hurt him, but I saw 
I had put it to him as a chal- 
lenge and he must have had some 
guilt feelings about accepting all 
that luxury for being nothing 
more than he was. “I could fulfill 
the duties of an ordinary space- 
man, sir.” 

I snorted. “It takes skill and 
training, Baxter. Your papers en- 
title you to one position and one 
only anywhere — Accident Prone 
of a spaceship complement. If 
you refuse to do your duties in 
that post, you can only become a 
ward of the Galaxy.” 



BREAK A LEG 



133 



His jaw line firmed. He had 
gone through a lot to keep from 
taking such abject charity. “Isn’t 
there,” he asked in a milder tone, 
“any other position I could serve 
in on this ship, sir?” 

I studied his face a moment. 
“We had to blast off without an 
Assistant Pile Driver, j.g. It keeps 
getting harder and harder to re- 
cruit an APD, j.g. I suppose it’s 
those reports about the eventual 
fatalities due to radiation leak 
back there where they are sta- 
tioned.” 

Baxter looked back at me 
steadily. “There are a lot of ru- 
mors about the high mortality 
rate among Accident Prones in 
space, too.” 



TTE was right. We had started 
the rumors. We wanted the 
Prones alert, active and scheming 
to stay alive. More beneficial ac- 
cidents that way. Actually, most 
Prones died of old age in space, 
which is more than could be said 
of them on Earth, where they 
didn’t have the kind of protection 
the Service gives them. 

“Look here, Baxter, do you like 
your quarters on this ship?” I de- 
manded. 

“You mean this master bed- 
room, the private heated swim- 
ming pool, the tennis court, bowl- 
ing alley and all? Yes, sir, I like 
it.” 

“The Assistant Pile Driver has 
a cot near the fuel tanks.” 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




He gazed off over my left 
shoulder. “I had a bed behind 
the furnace back on Earth before 
the building I was working in 
burned down.” 

“You wouldn’t like this one any 
better than the one before.” 

“But there I would have some 
chance of advancement. I don’t 
want to be stuck in the rank of 
Accident Prone for life.” 

I stared at him in frank amaze- 
ment. “Baxter, the only rank get- 
ting higher pay or more privi- 
leges than Prone is Grand Ad- 
miral of the Services, a position 
it would take you at least fifty 
years to reach if you had the luck 
and brains to make it, which you 
haven’t.” 



“I had something more modest 
in mind, sir. Like being a cap- 
tain.” 

He surely must have known 
how I lived in comparison to him, 
so I didn’t bother to remind him. 
I said, “Have you ever seen a 
case of radiation poisoning?” 
Baxter’s jaw thrust forward. 
“It must be pretty bad — but it 
isn’t as violent as being eaten 
by floating fungi or being swal- 
lowed in an earthquake on some 
airless satelite.” 

“No,” I agreed, “it is much 
slower than any of those. It is un- 
fortunate that we don’t carry the 
necessary supplies to take care 
of Pile Drivers. Most of our medi- 
cal supplies are in the Accident 



BREAK A LEG 



135 



Prone First Aid Kit, for the ex- 
clusive use of the Prone. Have 
you ever taken a good look at 
that?” 

Baxter shivered. “Yes, I’ve seen 
it. Several drums of blood, Type 
AB, my type. A half-dozen fresh- 
frozen assorted arms and legs, 
several rows of eyes, a hundred 
square feet of graftable skin, and 
a well-stocked tank of inner or- 
gans and a double-doored bank 
of nerve lengths. Impressive.” 

I smiled. “Sort of gives you a 
feeling of confidence and secu- 
rity, doesn’t it? It would be un- 
fortunate for anyone who had a 
great many accidents to be de- 
nied the supplies in that Kit, I 
should think. Of course, it is avail- 
able only to those filling the posi- 
tion of Accident Prone and doing 
the work faithfully and accord- 
ing to orders.” 

“Yes, sir,” Charlie mumbled. 

“Selby is your personal physi- 
cian, you realize,” I drove on. 
“He takes care of the rest of us 
only if he has time left over from 
you. Why, when I was having 
my two weeks in the summer as 
an Ensign, I had to lie for half 
an hour with a crushed foot while 
the doctor sprayed- our Prone’s 
throat to guard against infection. 
Let me tell you, I was in quite a 
bit of pain.” 

Charlie’s pale eyes narrowed as 
if he had just made a sudden dis- 
covery, perhaps about the rela- 

136 



tionship between us. “You don’t 
make as much money as I do, 
do you, sir? You don’t have a 
valet? And your bed folds into 
the bulkhead?” 

I thought he was at last be- 
ginning to get it. “Yes,” I said. 

He stood sharply to attention. 
“Request transfer to position of 
Assistant Pile Driver, j.g., sir.” 

I barely halted a groan. He 
thought I resented him and was 
deliberately holding him down 
into the miserable overpaid, over- 
fed job that was beneath him and 
the talents that so fitted him for 
the job. 

“Request granted.” 

He would learn. 

He had better. 

I started to sweat in a gush. 
He had really better. 

T TOOK him into the rear of 
-*• the ship and showed him 
where he would sleep. In the oily 
gloom, he regarded the pad from 
an old acceleration couch fitted 
to two scratched and nicked alu- 
minum pipes jury-rigged between 
two squat tanks containing water 
for the atomic pile used close to 
planets where the gravitational 
field interfered with the star- 
drive. 

“Over here’s what you have to 
keep an eye on, Baxter,” I told 
him. 

We walked past the dimly 
lighted rows of towering fuel lines 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and cables. Charlie tripped over 
the hump of a deck-level cable 
housing. His knee banged against 
the deck plates and he stood with 
an effort. 

“Careful,” I said. “Now that 
you have limited medical atten- 
tion, don’t break a leg.” 

Baxter rubbed his leg thought- 
fully. “Funny. My grandfather 
used to be in show business. He 
told me that telling somebody to 
break a leg was wishing them 
good luck.” 

I cleared my throat. “It would 
seem in dubious taste, addressed 
to an accident prone. However, 
you have my best wishes. You 
realize that your salary as Prone 
of 11,000 credits a month and 
your pay of 23 credits a month 
as an APD, j.g., are suspended 
until the Admiralty rules on your 
case.” 

“Yes, sir. I realize that, sir.” 

I stopped him in front of the 
soiled red box that was the ten- 
sion gauge. “If the electrical con- 
trol of the drive somehow be- 
comes broken, the interrupted 
circuit will show on the gauge. It 
is then the duty of the APD, j.g., 
to go through the small airlock 
and maintain manual control of 
the pile while at least one of the 
control circuits is repaired. The 
job rarely has to be done, but 
when it is, it is very often fatal.” 
Baxter only nodded. “I under- 
stand.” 



I doubted that he did. 

After leaving Baxter on his 
first watch, I went to the messfiall 
and waited for him to show up. 
The men knew what to do when 
he came. 

It was rather pleasant to sit 
there savoring the odors. At times, 
they still seem more like those of 
a chemical laboratory than a 
kitchen, but I have become so 
used to associating burning starch 
products, centrifuged tannic acid, 
and melting dextrose with food 
that I am almost immune to the 
aroma of Prone food like juicy, 
sizzling steak. Almost. 

HARLIE Baxter finally came 
" •* through the hatch. He paused 
and seemed to shake off what he 
must have thought was some 
olfactory hallucination and started 
to sit down at the table with 
the rest of the men. He looked 
rather pleased. He had probably 
decided being Accident Prone 
had deprived him of much of the 
company he had every right to 
enjoy with his shipmates. 

“Get out of here!” Frank Peir- 
monte yelled, jumping up from 
the other end of the oblong table. 

“Why?” Baxter asked in as- 
tonishment. 

“Baxter,” I put in, “I’m afraid 
the men think they may catch 
radiation fever from a pile driver 
like you.” 

“Catch radiation fever?” he re- 



BREAK A LEG 



137 



peated. “Men have been exposed 
to atomics for hundred of years. 
Surely you men must know any 
poisoning in one individual can’t 
be transmitted to another like 
germs. I couldn’t absorb enough 
radiation to be dangerous to you 
in simple proximity and still be 
alive. Don’t you see that?” 

At once, all of my crew at the 
table covered their faces with 
their arms. 

“Don’t look at us!” Bronoski 
screamed, his voice knifing toward 
the higher octaves. 

Baxter gaped in a daze from 
one of us to the other. “What do 
you mean? Why shouldn’t I look 
at you?” 

“You’ve got The Eye! All pile 
drivers get it.” 

“But I have to eat,” he objected. 
“I’m hungry. Really I am.” 

I swung around and exchanged 
a few words with Tan Eck, the 
cook, at the rear hatch. I took 
a steaming tray and went across 
the compartment, averting my 
face. 

“You will have to forgive these 
superstitious spacemen,” I apolo- 
gized to Baxter. “You go right 
ahead and eat just outside the 
door. I won’t mind a bit.” 

“Thanks,” Baxter said, accept- 
ing the plate. He looked down 
at the white paste, black gum and 
cup of yellowish liquid fitted in 
the proper holes and slots, then 
up at me. “What is this stuff?” 



“You don’t have to look right 
at me!” I snapped. “It is stand- 
ard spaceman’s fare — re-recon- 
stituted carbohydrates, protein 
and hot ground roasted soya. This 
is stuff we had left over on our 
plates from lunch, all set to go 
into the converter, but Tan Eck 
reprocessed it for you. It’s what 
regulations specify for an APD, 
j-g” 

Baxter opened his mouth and 
closed it hard. “Yes, sir. Thank 
you, sir.” 

He turned smartly to leave 
and I halted him with a palm 
up. “Baxter.” 

He turned. “Yes, sir?” 

“We are moving to the other 
side of the continent to continue 
with the re-survey. I want to 
make it clear to you that you are 
absolutely forbidden to leave the 
ship. We can’t spare the guards 
for your liabilities, now that you 
have thrown away your value.” 
“Yes, sir.” 

Even at the time, I was grati- 
fied by the sudden thoughtful 
narrowing of his eyes. 

1 WASN’T surprised the next 
day when Bronoski reported 
that Charlie Baxter had taken a 
bacpac — food, soap, blankets and 
so forth — and left the Hilliard. 
He was determined to prove that 
he wasn’t merely Accident Prone 
and could get things done on 
this own. 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Charterson and Von Elder- 
man are following him?” I asked. 

Bronoski nodded his bullet- 
shaped head. “Like a hawk.” 

“The Bird can follow him like 
a hawk. I want them to follow 
him like men.” 

“They are as good at the job 
as I am,” Bronoski reassured me. 

“I think,” I said quickly, “that 
I had better go down to Commu- 
nications and follow Baxter my- 
self.” 

The Bird was an electronic 
device. It looked like a local life- 
form that was actually a flying 
mammal. Inside the thing was 
was a sensitive video camera and 
a self-propulsion unit. 

The Bird homed in on Baxter’s 
electroencephalograph waves. 

The view on the screen in 
front of the lounging chairs was 
clear but monotonous. 

Charlie made his way across 
the landscape, woods on this side 
of the continent, not jungle, with- 
out incident. He did fall down 
like a wet laundry bag every so 
often, but that, as you’d figure, 
amounted to traveling across 
country without incident. He’d 
have done the same on a smooth 
pavement. 

I had a cigarette in my mouth, 
futilely pounding my pockets for 
the lighter I didn’t have, when 
Charlie met the alien. 

There was only one native this 
time, the same thin form, but 



more lightly clothed here. I 
shifted uneasily and hoped the 
two guards were close. There 
was only one this time, but it 
was useless to suppose Charlie 
could handle him himself. 

“Greetings,” Charlie said. “I 
am Big Brother of a new Family.” 

There was no sound equip- 
ment in the Bird, but the trans- 
lator circuits in the control board 
read Baxter’s lips and produced 
their sound patterns for us. They 
would also translate the native’s 
language, but just then he wasn’t 
saying anything. 

He walked around the Prone 
leisurely, as if considering buying 
him. 

Charlie shifted the straps of 
his pack. He hadn’t been con- 
vinced of his own abilities enough 
to take along a gun or any other 
kind of weapon. He would be 
almost sure to kill himself with 
it. 

Or would he? 

I suddenly wondered if Charlie 
doubted himself enough to com- 
mit outright suicide. He had had 
plenty of close calls, yet he had 
always survived. If his goal was 
self-destruction, he surely would 
have reached it after this many 
opportunities. 

I watched the screen intently. 

Charlie thought he was alone 
there with a possibly hostile na- 
tive. All he had to do was make 
one small slip and he would be 



BREAK A LEG 



139 . 



dead. Yet, so far, he had followed 
the pattern we had used at the 
other colony exactly. 

Instantly I realized that it 
must be a mistake to follow the 
other pattern with this second 
group of aliens, if Charlie Baxter 
did it. 

A T first I couldn’t understand 
why the pattern should be 
wrong for this group if it was 
right for the first. They were 
close enough so that there must 
have been intercourse between 
them, and if customs were vio- 
lently different, there would 
probably be a state of warfare 
between them and none was 
apparent. 

I finally realized why warfare 
would be almost impossible and 
why the customs of the separated 
colonies might be extremely at 
odds. 

The colonies were three months 
apart by fastest transportation, 
which was longer than a genera- 
tion of the natives. No one could 
live long enough to reach a 
second colony, so each culture 
developed in isolation along en- 
tirely random lines. 

I felt like yelling at Charlie. 
There was literally no way of tel- 
ling how he might be offending 
and antagonizing this Moranite by 
treating him as we had learned 
to treat the others. 

The alien finally spoke. “You

are part of a — Family?” 

Charlie nodded his head. 

So did the native — he bobbed 
Charlie’s head with a rock. 

“Close in on ’em fast but 
gentle,” I radioed the guards. 

The native dragged Baxter’s 
limp body through a nearby 
thicket and into a small clearing. 
Abruptly I saw they were up 
against the base of the nearest 
mountain. A bubbling, dancing 
stream twisted through brown 
and green rock and disappeared 
into a ridge of gray slate. It re- 
appeared below the hill, steam- 
ing, obviously passing through 
an underground hot springs. 

The alien had Charlie where 
he wanted him before we could 
move. He lashed him securely 
with stringy vine and, with him 
thrown over his shoulder, ran 
up the slate, which rumbled down 
ominously behind them. He tossed 
Charlie over a wide hole at the 
top of the ridge. Slate rained 
down into the hole. If the Prone 
hadn’t snapped awake and made 
his body rigid, he would have 
tumbled into the hole at that 
moment. 

“So you wake, Familyman,” 
the native said. “How could you 
admit to being anything so im- 
moral when you were alone? You 
surely did not think you could 
eat me without help from the 
others of your evil brothers!” 

Charlie licked his lips and

moved his eyes; that was about 
all he dared move. “You — don’t 
approve of families?” 

The native drew himself up 
to his full elongated height in 
the screen. “Like all good People, 
I was properly abandoned at 
birth and I proudly say I have 
never associated with others ex- 
cept for Mating and Trading.” 

I noticed abstractly that he 
finished moving his lips long be- 
fore the translation was finished. 
He was using a very primitive 
language. I screwed the button 
nervously in my ear for Charter- 
son and Von Elderman to report. 

T HE alien looked at the rigid 
form of Baxter over the pit. 
“I suppose I should have some 
pity for you. You began your 
filthy practice too young to know 
better. But imagine! Combining 
with others of your kind to sur- 
vive — at the expense of decent 
individuals like myself. Robbing 
us, eating us. The Finger of Fire 
will come soon and will destroy 
you. I have heard Familymen 
often try to aid one another. Per- 
haps others of your kind will die 
with you!” 

He was gone long before the 
translation was finished, leaving 
Charlie Baxter arched across a 
pit that widened as the alien’s 
descent disturbed more of the 
soft shale. 

The native was out of sight. 



I realized his tribe would seon 
be extinct. The racial mind for 
the whole species seemed obsessed 
with survival by natural selec- 
tion, but his tribe had gone off 
on the tangent of individualism, 
which was fine to some extent, 
but the Service had learned that 
a race couldn’t survive without 
some degree of cooperation and 
this one’s level of mating and 
trading did not seem sufficient. 

“Captain Jackson!” Von Elder- 
man’s voice said in my ear. “We 
can’t reach him! If we start up 
that hill, the soft shale is bound 
to shift and drop him right into 
that hole.” 

“I’ll send Bronoski with a per- 
sonal flyer immediately to make 
an air pickup,” I said numbly. 

It wasn’t the guards’ fault. 
Charlie hadn’t seemed to be in 
any immediate danger and we 
don’t kill intelligent life-forms 
without damned good reason — 
the kind of reason that stands 
up in court. But he was now 
stretched over what I was fairly 
certain was an active geyser — 
“The finger of fire,” the native 
had called it, and had assured 
Charlie that it would kill him. 

I dispatched Bronoski, but that 
was all I could do. I did not know 
when the geyser would spout. 
Maybe Bronoski would make it. 
Maybe he wouldn’t. 

I magnified the view from the 
useless little Bird and studied 



BREAK A LEG 



141 



Charlie’s face in the screen. If he 
lay there doing nothing, waiting 
for a miracle to happen, he was 
— I shuddered — cooked. He had 
to make an active decision. 

If he didn’t, he was almost sure 
to die. 

But maybe that was what he 
wanted. Maybe accident prones 
really want to destroy themselves. 

It was his bid. 

Slate dropped off the rim of 
the hole into the pit and Charlie 
stiffened. More passive accep- 
tance. But maybe I wasn’t being 
fair. There wasn’t much Charlie 
could do. There wasn’t much else 
for him to do except give up. 

But I noticed his eyes moving. 
They went up to the bubbling rib- 
bon of water and down to the 
steaming stream below the ridge 
where it emerged. Charlie smiled. 
He had made a decision. 

He folded his knees and dropped 
into the hole. 

He had naturally made the 
wrong decision. Bronoski in the 
flying platform swung into posi- 
tion above the pit. 

/^HARLIE must have figured 
^ that he would be washed on 
through the hot springs and out 
into the shallow water below. He 
would be, but he would be boiled 
alive. 

Only there are mistakes and 
mistakes, and sometimes mistakes 
aren’t mistakes at all. 




The geyser exploded, higher, 
faster and harder than it ever 
had before. And Charlie, half- 
drowned and half-or-more 
scalded, popped up and landed 
in the brush twenty feet away. 

Bronoski fought for control of 
his flyer and finally made a fast 
pickup. 

Doc Selby did a pretty good 
job with the First Aid Kit. Char- 
lie’s neck and collarbone were 
broken and over fifty per cent 
of his skin had to be replaced. 
Still, it was lucky Charlie had 
that concentrated soap in his 
pack. Ever been to Earth Na- 
tional Park and seen Old Faith- 
ful? You know what happened 
— they use soap to get the geyser 
spouting when it’s off schedule. 

We haven’t told Charlie that 
it was anything but an accident 
that Bronoski was so handy. And 
we let him tell us about the 
changed customs of the natives. 
He resumed his regular position 
of Accident Prone when he saw 
realistically that he would inevi- 
tably be doing the same work and 
that he might as well get paid 
for it. 

I often wonder if it was a 
genuine mistake the way he 
dropped into the geyser. Certainly 
he would have died if it hadn’t 
been for the soap concentrates. 
If he took that into consideration, 
though, it wasn’t a mistake at all, 
but a wise choice. 



BREAK A LEG 



143 



A few days ago, when he was 
leaving my office — that is, the 
bridge — I saw Charlie slip and 
start to fall. He didn’t give up 
and go limp. He gave his old 
dance of struggling to regain his 
balance. Only this time he made 
it! 

I began sweating again. 

After all the time, effort and 
money the Service puts into ac- 
quiring and training a Prone, I 
wonder if it is possible for one to 
beat his problem and cease to be 



an Accident Prone or even an 
accident prone. 

This afternoon, I passed Charlie 
Baxter’s swimming pool and saw 
him poised on his diving board. 
I waved and rather jauntily ex- 
tended his grandfather’s wish for 
good luck: “Break a leg.” 

Charlie grinned back at me. 
“Yes, sir.” 

But he didn’t. 

It would be very reassuring if 
he would.
