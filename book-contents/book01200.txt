THE CONSENTIENCY— 
And How It Got That Way 



FRANK HERBERT 



This article is being written to 
dispel a myth which we who write 
know to exist because of the 
Johnny-one-note question we keep 
getting from so many readers. I will 
presently tell all about the origins of 
Whipping Star, Dosadi Experiment 
and other McKie stories. First, 
however, the question: 

“Where do you get your ideas?” 
I’ve conducted a small survey 
among fellow writers to explore this 
question. Here are a few sample 
discoveries: 

Jack Vance gets his ideas from a 
Leprechaun he trapped with an ar- 
cane spell outside a pub in Shil- 
lelagh, Ireland. 

Poul Anderson gets his ideas 
from a gross, dirty old man with a 
Dutch accent who drops by without 
warning, passes over a greasy table 
napkin covered with scribblings and 
says: “Here! Write aboudt dis!” 
Harlan Ellison gets his ideas in a 
plain brown wrapper from Schenec- 
tady, New York. No return address. 

Larry Niven gets his ideas from 
words whieh appear mysteriously on 
the inside faces of his glasses. 

Lester del Rey gets his ideas 
from messages written in invisible 
ink on the backs of wine labels 




7t 

from Bordeaux. Not every label car- 
ries a message and he must, there- 
fore, sample many bottles before 
getting the right one. Just inciden- 
tally, this has made him a wine ex- 
pert. 

As you can see, the origins are as 
varied as the people. 

1 get my ideas from different 
sources for different stories. For the 
McKie stories, the origin is a Ta- 
prisiot I attempted to use as 
firewood. He did, after all, appear 
to be a stubby brown log with limbs 
short enough to go into my fire- 
place. Seeing my intention, the Ta- 
prisiot proposed a bargain: Ideas in 
exchange for his life. He also ex- 
plained that he was extremely low 
in British Thermal Units. 

As those of you who’ve read the 
other McKie stories know, the Ta- 
prisiot communicated with me by a 
direct mental linkage — mind to 
mind. This feat naturally did not 
shock or surprise a science fiction 
writer. It does, however, explain 
those occasional times when frienc(g 
have found me uncommunicative, 
twitching and trembling in a 
zombie-like snigger-like trance. 
This is a necessary physical condi- 
tion for Taprisiot communication. 



THE CONSENTIENCY 



5 




It should be obvious by now that 
I have retreated into amusement to 
escape that constant question about 
ideas. I’ll say it plainly: Ideas are a 
dime a dozen and are never more 
than a mere beginning. In develop- 
ment of an idea is where you find 
the story. 

Sample idea: Water runs uphill 
for five minutes in every twenty- 
four hours. What kind of a world 
would develop, and what technol- 
ogy would you find, in response to 
such a phenomenon? Go design a 
toilet for such a world. 

Then there’s the question of what 
causes such an oddity. (Harry 
Stubbs, be my guest.) 

I invite you to play with this rela- 
tively simple idea for awhile before 
continuing. Just to give you a feel- 
ing for idea development. 

Now: the McKie stories, no 
diversions into parody, just the 
straight quill. (Most writers use a 
straight quill which has some con- 
nection with a goose.) 

Oddly, the McKie stories stemmed 
from ready John Adams, the 
revolutionary, the constitutionalist, 
the dogmatist among our founding 
fathers. He was a tight-lipped, 
tight-fisted lawyer who was at heart 
an aristocrat of the intellect. 
Adams, in contrast to Thomas 
Paine, believed that majority rule 
could lead to just as many errors as 
the most autocratic minority rule. 
Adams distrusted power no matter 
who exercised it. 

Then, following a pattern 1 enjoy, 

I began taking out and examining 
some of my most dearly beloved as- 
sumptions: 

That Law will always bring jus- 
tice provided you perfect the Law. 

6 



That the speedy execution of new 
political concepts and social 
changes is really what we all need. 
(Delays are bad.) 

That life should be made easier 
for those we choose to have govern 
us — they should be paid more, get 
all sorts of help, should never be 
frustrated or angered. (Red tape is 
evil.) 

That government should be as 
centralized and as big as possible to 
oveiride the mounting difficulties of 
a diverse, technological world. 
(Small is inefficient and ugly.) 

Now, contrast the universe of Joij 
X. McKie, Saboteur Extraordinare, 
agent of the Bureau of Sabotage 
(BuSab): 

With few exceptions, he can dis- 
rupt anyone or anything. His man- 
date is to protect the rights of pri- 
vate citizens by selectively slowing 
the workings of government and 
too-powerful industry (which tends 
to act like government, as witness 
the activities of present multi- 
national corporations). 

BuSab originated in a past where 
good-intentioned people eliminated 
red tape. Government slipped into 
high gear, moving faster and faster. 
Laws were passed within an hour of 
conception. New bureaus originated 
almost by whim, appropriations 
were spent almost as fast as they 
were earmarked. 

BuSab functions to slow things 
down, to incite disputes between 
people and agencies. It exposes the 
temperamental types who cannot 
handle power, cannot control them- 
selves or think under pressure. 
BuSab entertains the public by 
flamboyant obstructionism (behind 
which there is always at least a hint 



GALAXY 



of violence and viciousness to re- 
flect the bureau’s origin). It exposes 
a deeper reality by stirring up op- 
position between political factions, 
and in the bureau’s own func- 
tionaries you find an outlet for 
troublemakers. 

To keep down indiscriminate 
obstruction, some agencies are im- 
mune from sabotage all the time, 
others may be targets only under 
specific conditions (e.g. when they 
become too big, too powerful and 
begin to ride roughshod over indi- 
viduals). Only BuSab is never im- 
mune from its own ministrations. 
You advance in BuSab through suc- 
cessful sabotage against superiors. 

McKie’s universe is peopled by 
various sentient beings who function 
to hold those beloved assumptions 
up to a crueler examination. 

There are the Taprisiots, as 
above, an almost perfect means of 
communication, but they put you in 
peril when you employ them. 

The PanSpechi, a five-gendered 
race which can mimic almost any 
other sentient form, but which often 
chooses to mimic Human form ex- 
cept for the eyes which remain 
insect-faceted. The five-unit base is 
called a creche and has only one 
ego which passes periodically to a 
newly-prepared member of the 
creche. They tempt you to think of 
them as Human, but their thoughts 
and actions can be dangerous to 
people who make that mistake. 

T^ere are the Calebans. You see 
them as the visible stars. Calebans 
provide the ConSentient universe of 
Jorj X. McKie with jumpdoors. 
Through a jumpdoor’s portal you 
step from planet to planet instan- 
taneously, no matter die intervening 

THE CONSENTIENCY 



distance. If a jumpdoor happens to 
close while you’re in it, it cuts you 
into two neat (dead) pieces. It also 
opens the way to many new types 
of exploitation, not all of them be- 
nevolent. (Rapid transit doesn’t 
solve all of our problems.) 

We have Wreaves who carry the 
insect analogy a bit farther. They 
have two sets of mandibles ordinar- 
ily concealed in facial slits. One set 
is employed as we employ our 
hands. The other set is for fighting 
and is poison-tipped. They peram- 
bulate on limber pedal bifurcations. 
Wreaves form breeding triads which 
periodically exchange members, 
linking triad to triad in gigantic ex- 
tended families. The poisoned apple 
here is that if you offend one 
Wreave you offend the extended 
family and the result is vendetta. 

The ConSentiency also contains 
Palenki, creatures whose shape is 
similar to the giant tortoise But with 
a single prehensile arm protruding 
from the shell. 

We have Preylings, Chithers and 
Soborips — all deliberately left vague 
for possible future use. We have 
Laclacs, supple and reserved crea- 
tures who employ tendrils as Hu- 
mans employ arms and hands. 

Then we have the Gowachin, the 
Frog People of Tandaloor whose 
concept of Law is the strangest in 
the ConSentiency. To them, ritual 
(form) is the foundation upon which 
Law stands, but Law must change 
to meet each new condition. They 
do not trust even their own Law, 
believing that even the most high- 
minded people will use legalisms 
for their own benefit. The Court- 
arena where they try their cases can 
be a scene of carnage. The losing 

7 




m (lawyer) forfeits his life. 
Any jurist or client who makes a 
misstep can be dispatched. This is a 
situation, as McKie notes, which 
makes for infrequent trials and 
memorable court performances. 
McKie is a Legum. 

Just as the Gowachin have some 
legal terminology which vaguely re- 
calls Human legalisms, the Frog 
People are only vaguely similar to 
terrestrial frogs. They are amphib- 
ians who can breathe through chest 
ventricles when out of water. They 
lay eggs in water and the males 
ravenously weed out their own tads. 
Only the most nimble and alert sur- 
vive. (Gowachin characteristics and 
their Law are explored more 
thoroughly in Dosadi Experiment, 
but this gives you a glimpse of 
them.) 



GALAXY 



For untold generations 
death and suffering had 
been their portion — now 
all that would change. 



As in Whipping Star where the 
focus was on the Calebans, Dosadi 
Experiment emphasizes the difficul- ' 
ties in establishing real communica- 
tion between sentient species who 
perceive things in profoundly differ- 
ent ways. Where Whipping Star 
concentrated on Calebans and their 
S’ eye Effects, Dosadi Experiment 
concentrates on Human-Gowachin 
relationships. The new story has 
characters from the previous one: 
(Napoleon) Bildoon, a PanSpechi. 
and chief of McKie’s BuSab; the 
Caleban Fannie Mae, who is the 
visible star Thyone. .and McKie. 

There’s an additional question of 
even greater moment, however. 
What do you find out about such 
people when you deliberately throw 
them into conditions of extremis? 
How’s that for an idea?

Charles Sheffield Tom Purdom J.E. Pournelle 



SPIDER ROBINSON RICHARD E. GEIS 



We have created a monster — 
enormously valuable and even 
useful, yet extremely dangerous. 
Our monster is both beautiful and 
terrifying. We do not dare use 
this monster to its full potential, 
but we cannot release our grasp 
upon it. 

— Gowachin assessment of 
the Dosadi experiment 



A tiULLET WENT spang! against the 
window behind Keila Jedrik’s desk, 
ricocheted and screamed off into 
the canyon street far below her 
office. Jedrik prided herself that she 
had not even flinched. The Elector’s 
patrols would take care of the 
sniper. The patrols which swept the 
streets of Chu every morning would 
home on the sound of the shot. She 
held the casual hope that the sniper 
would escape back to the Rim Rab- 
ble, but she recognized this hope as 
a weakness and dismissed it. There 
were concerns this morning far 
more important than an infiltrator 
from the Rim. 

Jedrik reached one hand into the 
comer of early sunlight which il- 
luminated the contact plates of her 
terminal in the Master Accountancy 
computer. Those flying fingers — she 
could almost disassociate herself 
from them. They darted like insects 
at the waiting keys. The terminal 
was a functional instrument, symbol 
of her status as a Senior Liaitor. It 
sat all alone in its desk slot — grey, 
green, gold, black, white and 
deadly. Its grey screen was almost 
precisely the tone of her desk top. 

With careful precision, her fin- 



gers played their rhythms on the 
keys. The screen produced yellow 
numbers, all weighted and averaged 
at her command — a thin strip of 
destiny with violence hidden in its 
golden shapes. 

Every angel carries a sword, she 
thought. 

But she did not really , consider 
herself an angel or her weapon a 
sword. Her real weapon was an in- 
tellect hardened and sharpened by 
the terrible decisions her planet re- 
quired. Emotions were a force to be 
diverted within the self or to be 
used against anyone who had failed 
to leam what Dosadi taught. She 
knew her own weakness and hid it 
carefully: she’d been taught by lov- 
ing parents (who’d concealed their 
love behind exquisite cruelty) that 
Dosadi’s decisions were indeed ter- 
rible. 

Jedrik studied the numbers on her 
computer display, cleared the screen 
and made a new entry. As she did 
this, she knew she took sustenance 
from fifty of her planet’s Human 
inhabitants. Many of those fifty 
would not long survive this callous 
jape. In truth, her fingers were 
weapons of death for those who 
failed this test. She felt no guilt 
about those she slew. The imminent 
arrival of one Jorj X. McKie dic- 
tated her actions, precipitated them. 

When she thought about McKie, 
her basic feeling was one of satis- 
faction. She’d waited for McKie 
like a predator beside a burrow in 
the earth. His name and identifying 
keys had been given to her by her 
chauffeur, Havvy, hoping to in- 
crease his value to her. She’d taken 
the information and had made her 
usual investigation. Jedrik doubted 



10 



GALAXY 



that any other person on Dosadi 
could have come up with the result 
her sources produced: Jorj X. 
McKie was an adult Human who 
could not possibly exist. No record 
of him could be found on all of 
Dosadi — not on the poisonous Rim, 
not in Chu’s Warrens, not in any 
niche of the existing power struc- 
ture. McKie did not exist, but he 
was due to arrive in Chu momentari- 
ly, smuggled into the city by a 
Gowachin temporarily under her 
control. 

McKie was the precision element 
for which she had waited. He was 
not merely a possible key to the 
God Wall (not a bent and damaged 
key like Havvy) but a clean and cer- 
tain key. She had never been pre- 
pared to break this lock with poor 
instruments. There would be one 
chance and only one chance; it re- 
quired the best. 

Thus fifty of Dosadi’s Humans 
took their faceless places behind the 
numbers of her computer terminal. 
They were bait, expendable. Those 
who died by her act would not die 
immediately and forty-nine of them 
might never know they’d been de- 
liberately submitted to early death 
by a deliberate act nor that she had 
done this thing. Some of them 
would be pushed back to the Rim’s 
short and desperate existence. 
Others would waste away in the 
Warrens. And the deadly process 
would extend across sufficient time 
to dull any sense of immediacy until 
the moment of extinction. But 
they’d been slain by her fingers on 
the computer keys and she knew it. 
She cursed her parents for that un- 
wanted awareness of the blood and 
sinew behind the numbers. Those 



loving parents had taught her well. 
She might never see the bodies of 
the ones she slew, need not give 
another thought to all but one of the 
fifty; still she sensed them all be- 
hind her computer dis- 

play . warm and pulsing. 

Jedrik sighed. 

The fifty were bleating animals 
staked out to lure a dangerous beast 
onto Dosadi’s poisonous soil from 
outside the God Wall. Her fifty 
would create a fractional surplus 
here which would be gone, swal- 
lowed before anyone else realized 
their importance. 

Dosadi is a sick place, she 
thought. And not for the first time, 
she wondered: Is this really Hell? 

Many believed it. 

We are being punished. 

But no one knew what they’d 
done to deserve this punishment. 

Jedrik leaned back, looked across 
her doorless office to the sound bar- 
rier and milky light of the hall. A 
strange Gowachin shambled past her 
doorway. He was, a frog figure on 
some official errand, a packet of 
brown paper clutched in his knobby 
hands. His green skin shimmered as 
though he’d recently come from wa- 
ter. 

The Gowachin reminded her of 
Bahrank, he who was bringing 
McKie into her net. Bahrank, who 
did her bidding because she control- 
led the substance to which he was 
addicted. More fool he to let him- 
self become an addict to anything, 
even to living. One day soon 
Bahrank would sell what he knew 
about her to the Elector’s spies; by 
then it would be too late and the 
Elector would leam only what she 
wanted him to learn when she 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



11 



•wanted him to leam it. She’d cho- 
sen Bahrank with the same care 
she’d used at her computer termi- 
nal, the same care which had made 
her wait for someone precisely like 
McKie. And Bahrank was 
Gowachin. Once committed to a 
project, the Frog People were 
notorious for carrying out their or- 
ders in a precise way. They pos- 
sessed an inbred sense of order but 
understood the limits of law. 

As her gaze traversed the office, 
the sparse and functional efficiency 
of the space filled her with quiet 
amusement. This office presented 
an image of her which she had con- 
structed with meticulous care. It 
pleased her that she would be leav- 
ing here soon never to return, like 
an insect shedding its skin. The 
office was four paces wide, eight 
long. Twelve black metal rotofiles 
lined the wall on her left, dark sen- 
tinels of her methodical ways. She 
had reset their locking codes and 
armed them to destroy their contents 
when the Elector’s toads pried into 
them. The Elector’s people would 
attribute this to outrage, a last angry 
sabotage. It would be some time be- 
fore accumulating doubts would 
lead them to reassessment and to 
fhistrated questions. Even then they 
might not suspect her hand in the 
elimination of fifty Humans. She, 
after all, was one of the fifty. 

How pervasive were the seduc- 
tions of Dosadi’s power structure! 
How subtle! What she’d just done 
here introduced a flaw into the 
computer system which ruled the 
distribution of non-poisonous food 
in Dosadi’s only city. Food — here 
was the real base of Dosadi’s social 
pyramid, solid and ugly. The flaw 

12 



removed her from a puissant niche 
in that pyramid. She had worn the 
persona of Keila Jedrik, Liaitor for 
many years, long enough to leam 
enjoyment of the power system. 
Losing one valuable counter in 
Dosadi’s endless survival game, she 
must now live and act only with the 
persona of Keila Jedrik, Warlord. 
This was an all-or-nothing move, a 
gambler’s plunge. She felt the 
nakedness of it. But this^ gamble 
had begun long ago, far back in 
Dosadi’s contrived history, when 
her ancestors had recognized the na- 
ture of this planet and had begun 
breeding and training for the indi- 
vidual who would take this plunge. 

I am that individual, she told her- 
self. This is our moment. 

But had they truly assessed the 
problem correctly? 

Jediik’s glance fell on the single 
window which looked out into the 
canyon street. Her own reflection 
stared back: a face too narrow, thin 
nose, eyes and mouth too large. Her 
hair could be an interesting black 
velvet helmet if she let it grow, but 
she kept it cropped short as a re- 
minder that she was not a magnetic 
sex partner, that she must rely on 
her wits. That was the way she’d 
been bred and trained. Dosadi had 
taught her its cruelest lessons early. 
She’d grown tall while still in her 
teens, carrying more height in her 
body than in her legs so that she 
appeared even taller when seated. 
She looked down on most 
Gowachin and Human males in 
more ways than one. That was 
another gift (and lesson) from her 
loving parents and from their ances- 
tors. There was no escaping this 
Dosadi lesson.

What you love or value will be 
used against you. 

She leaned forward to hide her 
disquieting reflection, peered far 
down into the street. There, that 
was better. Her fellow Dosadis no 
longer were warm and pulsing 
people. They were reduced to dis- 
tant movements, as impersonal as 
the dancing figures in her computer. 

Traffic was light, she noted. 
Very few armored vehicles moved, 
no pedestrians. There’d been only 
that one shot at her window. She 
still entertained a faint hope that the 
sniper had escaped. More likely a 
patrol had caught the fool. The Rim 
Rabble persisted in testing Chu’s 
defenses despite the boringly repeti- 
tive results. It was desperation. 
Snipers seldom waited until the day 
was deep and still and the patrols 
were scattered, those hours when 
even some among the most power- 
ful ventured out. 

Symptoms, all symptoms. 

Rim sorties represented only one 
among many Dosadi symptoms 
which she’d taught herself to read 
in that precarious climb whose early 
stage came to climax in this room. 
It was not just a thought, but more 
a sense of familiar awareness to 
which she returned at oddly reflex- 
ive moments in her life. 

We have a disturbed relationship 
with our past which religion cannot 
explain. We are primitive in unex- 
plainable ways, our lives woven of 
the familiar and the strange, the 
reasonable and the insane. 

It made some insane choices 
magnificently attractive. 

Have / made an insane choice? 

No! 

The data lay clearly in her mind, 
THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



facts which she could not obliterate 
by turning away from them. Dosadi 
had been designed from a cosmic 
grab bag; “Give them one of these 
and one of these and one of 
these. .’’ 

It made for imcompatible pair- 
ings. 

The DemoPoI with which Dosadi 
juggled its computer-monitored so- 
ciety didn’t fit a world which used 
energy transmitted from a satellite 
in geosynchronous orbit. The De- 
moPoI reeked of primitive igno- 
rance, something from a society 
which had wandered too far down 
the path of legalisms — a law for ev- 
erything and everything managed by 
law. The dogma that a God-inspired 
few had chosen Chu’s river canyon 
in which to build a city insulated 
from this poisonous planet, and that 
only some twenty or so generations 
earlier, remained indigestible. And 
that energy satellite which hovered 
beneath the God Wall’s barrier — 
that stank of a long and sophisti- 
cated evolution during which some- 
thing as obviously flawed as the 
DemoPol would have been dis- 
carded. 

It was a cosmic grab bag de- 
signed for a specific purpose which 
she only recently had begun to sus- 
pect. 

We did not evolve on this planet. 

The place was out of phase with 
both Gowachin and Human. Dosadi 
employed computer memories and 
physical files side by side for iden- 
tical purposes. And the number of 
addictive substances to be found on 
Dosadi was outrageous. Yet this 
was played off against a religion so 
contrived, so gross in its demands 
for ‘simple faith’ that the two condi- 

13 



tions remained at constant war. The 
mystics died for their ‘new insights’ 
while the holders of ‘simple faith’ 
used control of the addictive sub- 
stances to gain more and more 
power. The only real faith on 
Dosadi was that you survived by 
power and that you gained power 
by controlling what others required 
for survival. Their society under- 
stood the medicine of bacteria, virus 
and brain control, but these could 
not stamp out the Rim and Warren 
Underground where jabua faith 
healers cured their patients with the 
smoke of burning weeds. 

And they could not stamp out 
(not yet) Keila Jedrik because she 
had seen what she had seen. Two 
by two the incompatible things 
ebbed and flowed around her, in the 
cit^ of Chu and the surrounding 
Rim. It was the same in every case: 
a society which made use of one of 
these things could not naturally be a 
society which used the other. 

Not naturally. 

All around her, Jedrik sensed 
Chu with its indigestible polarities. 
They had only two species: Human 
and Gowachin. Why two? Were 
there no other species in this uni- 
verse? Subtle hints in some of 
Dosadi’s artifacts suggested an 
evolution for appendages other than 
the flexible fingers of Gowachin 
and Human. 

Why only one city on all of 
Dosadi? 

Dogma failed to answer. 

The Rim hordes huddled close, 
always seeking a way into Chu’s in- 
sulated purity. But they had a whole 
planet behind them. Granted it was 
a poisonous planet, but it had other 
rivers, other places of potential 



sanctuary. The survival of both 
species argued for the building of 
more sanctuaries, many more than 
that pitiful hole which Gar and Tria 
thought they masterminded. 
No . Chu stood alone — almost 
twenty kilometers wide and forty 
long, built on hills and silted islands 
where the river slowed in its deep 
canyon. At last count, some 
eighty-nine million people lived 
here and three times that number 
eked a short life on the Rim — 
pressing, always pressing for a 
place in the poison-free city. 

Give us your precious bodies, 
you stupid Rimmers! 

They heard the message, knew its 
import and defied it. 

What had the people of Dosadi 
done to be imprisoned here? What 
had their ancestors done? It was 
right to build a religion upon hate 
for such ancestors . provided 
such ancestors existed. 

Jedrik leaned toward the window, 
peered upward at the God Wall, 
that milky translucence which im- 
prisoned Dosadi, yet through which 
those such as this Jorj X. McKie 
could come at will. She hungered to 
see McKie in person, to confirm 
that he had not been contaminated 
as Havvy had been contaminated. 

It was a McKie she required 
now. The transparently contrived 
nature of Dosadi told her that there 
must be a McKie. She saw herself 
as the huntress, McKie her natural 
prey. The false identity she’d built 
in this room was part of her bait. 
Now, in the season of McKie, the 
underlying religious cant by which 
Dosadi’s powerful maintained their 
private illusions would crumble. 
She could already see the begin- 



14 



GALAXY 



nings of that dissolution; soon, ev- 
eryone would see it. 

She took a deep breath. There 
was a purity in what was about to 
happen, a simplification. She was 
about to divest herself of one of her 
two lives, taking all of her aware- 
ness into the persona of that other 
Keila Jedrik which all of Dosadi 
would soon know. Her people had 
kept her secret well, hiding a fat 
and sleazy blonde person from their 
fellow Dosadis, exposing just 
enough of that one to ‘X’ that the 
powers beyond the God Wall might 
react in the proper design. She felt 
cleansed by the fact that the dis- 
guise of that other life had begun to 
lose its importance. The whole of 
her could begin to surface in that 
other place. And McKie had pre- 
cipitated this metamorphosis. Jed- 
rik’s thoughts were clear and direct 
now: 

Come into my trap, McKie. You 
will take me higher than the palace 
apartments of the Council Hills. 

Or into a deeper hell than any 
nightmare has imagined. 

* * * 

How to start a war? Nurture your 
own latent hungers for power. 
Forget that only madmen pursue 
power for its own sake. Let such 
madmen gain power — even you. 
Let such madmen act behind their 
conventional masks of sanity. 
Whether their masks be fashioned 
from the delusions of defense or 
the theological aura of law, war 
will come. 

— Gowachin Aphorism 



The odalarm awoke Jorj X. 
McKie with a whiff of lemon. For 
just an instant his mind played 
tricks on him. He thought he was 
on Tutalsee’s gentle planetary ocean 
floating softly on his garlanded is? 
land. There were lemons on his 
floating island, banks of hibiscus 
and carpets of spicy alyssum. His 
bowered cottage lay in the path of 
perfumed breezes and the lemon. 

Awareness came. He was not on 
Tutalsee with a loving companion; 
he was on a trained bedog in the 
armored efficiency of his Central 
Central apartment; he was back in 
the heart of the Bureau of Sabo- 
tage; he was back at work. 

McKie shuddered. 

A planet full of people could die 
today ... or tomorrow. 

It would happen unless someone 
solved this Dosadi mystery. Know- 
ing the Gowachin as he did, McKie 
was convinced of it. The Gowachin 
were capable of cruel decisions, 
especially where their species’ pride 
was at stake, or for reasons which 
other species might not understand. 
Bildoon assessed this crisis the 
same way. Not since the Caleban 
problem had such enormity crossed 
the Consentient horizon. 

But where was this endangered 
planet, this Dosadi? 

After a night of sleep suppres- 
sion, the briefings about Dosadi 
came back vividly as though part of 
his mind had remained at work 
sharpening the images. Two opera- 
tives, one Wreave and one Laclac 
had made the report. The two were 
reliable and resourceful. Their 
sources were excellent, although 
the infoimation was sparse. The two 
also were bucking for promotion at 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



15 



a time when Wreaves and Laclacs 
were hinting at discrimination 
against their species. The report re- 
quired special scrutiny. No BuSab 
agent, regardless of species, was 
above some internal testing, a de- 
ception designed to weaken the 
Bureau and gain coup merits upon 
which to ride into the director’s 
office. 

However, BuSab was still di- 
rected by Bildoon, a PanSpechi in 
Human form, the fourth member of 
his creche to carry that name. It had 
been obvious from Bildoon’s first 
words that he believed the report. 

“McKie, this thing could set 
Human and Gowachin at each 
others’ throats.” 

It was an understandable idiom, 
although in point of fact you would 
go for the Gowachin abdomen to 
carry out the same threat. McKie al- 
ready had acquainted himself with 
the report and, from internal evi- 
dence to which his long association 
with the Gowachin made him sensi- 
- tive, he shared Bildoon’s assess- 
ment. Seating himself in a grey 
chairdog across the desk from the 
director in the rather small window- 
less office Bildoon had lately pre- 
ferred, McKie shifted the report 
from one hand to the other. Pre- 
sently, recognizing his own nervous 
mannerism, he put the report on the 
desk. It was on coded memowire 
which played to trained senses when 
passed through the fingers or across 
other sensitive appendage. 

“Why couldn’t they pinpoint this 
Dosadi’s location?” McKie asked. 

“It’s known only to a Caleban.” 

“Well, they’ll. .” 

“The Calebans refuse to re- 
spond.” 

16 



McKie stared across the desk at 
Bildoon. The polished surface re- 
flected a second image of the 
BuSab director, an inverted image 
to match the upright one. McKie 
studied the reflection. Until you fo- 
cused on Bildoon’s faceted eyes 
(how like an insect’s eyes they 
were) this PanSpechi appeared 
much like a Human male with dark 
hair and pleasant round face. 
Perhaps he’d put on more than the 
form when his flesh had been 
molded to Human shape. Bildoon’s 
face displayed emotions which 
McKie read in Human terms. The 
director appeared angry. 

McKie was troubled. 

“Refused?” 

“The Calebans don’t deny that 
Dosadi exists or that it’s threatened. 
They refuse to discuss it.” 

“Then we’re dealing with a 
Caleban contract and they’re obey- 
ing the terms of that contract.” 

Recalling that conversation with 
Bildoon as he awakened in his 
apartment, McKie lay quietly think- 
ing. Was Dosadi some new exten- 
sion of the Caleban Question? 

It's right to fear what we don’t 
understand. 

The Caleban mystery continually 
eluded ConSentient investigators. 
Just when you thought you had 
something pinned down, it slipped 
out of your grasp. Before the- Cale- 
bans had come with their gift of 
jumpdoors, the ConSentiency had 
been a relatively slow and under- 
standable federation of the known 
sentient species. The universe had 
contained itself in a shared space of 
recognizable dimensions. The 
ConSentiency of those days had 
grown in a way likened to expand- 

GAIAXY 



ing bubbles. It had been linear. 

Caleban jumpdoors had changed 
that with an explosive acceleration 
of every aspect of life which had 
made BuSab inevitable. Jumpdoors 
had been an immediately disruptive 
tool of power. They implied infinite 
usable dimensions. They implied 
many other things only faintly un- 
derstood. Through a Jumpdoor you 
stepped from a room on Tutalsee 
into a hallway here on Central Cen- 
tral. You walked through a 
jumpdoor here and found yourself 
in a garden on Paginui. The inter- 
vening ‘normal space’ might be 
measured in light years or parsecs, 
but the passage from one place to 
the other ignored such old concepts. 
And to this day, ConSentient inves- 
tigators did not understand how the 
jumpdoors worked. Concepts such 
as ‘relative space’ didn’t explain the 
phenomenon; they only added to the 
mystery. 

McKie ground his teeth in frustra- 
tion. Calebans inevitably did that to 
him. What good did it do to think 
of the Calebans as visible stars in 
the space his body occupied? He 
could look up from any planet 
where a jumpdoor deposited him 
and examine the night sky. Visible 
stars: ah, yes. Those are Calebans. 
What did that tell him? 

There was a strongly defended 
theory that Calebans were but a 
more sophisticated aspect of the 
equally mysterious Taprisiots. The 
ConSentiency had accepted and em- 
ployed Taprisiots for thousands of 
standard years. A Taprisiot pre- 
sented sentient form and size. They 
appeared to be short lengths of tree 
trunk cut off at top and bottom and 
with oddly protruding stub limbs. 



When you touched them they were 
warm and resilient. They were fel- 
low beings of the ConSentiency. 
But just as the Calebans took your 
flesh across the parsecs, Taprisiots 
took your awareness across those 
same parsecs to merge you with 
another mind." 

Taprisiots were a communications 
device. 

But current theory said Taprisiots 
had been introduced to prepare the 
ConSentiency for Calebans. 

It was dangerous to think of Ta- 
prisiots as merely a convenient 
means of communications. Equally 
dangerous to think of Calebans as 
‘transportation facilitators.’ [Look at 
the socially disruptive effect of 
jumpdoors! And when you em- 
ployed a Taprisiot you had a con- 
stant reminder of danger: the com- 
munications trance which reduced 
you to a twitching zombie while 
you made your call. No. .neither 
Calebans nor Taprisiots should be 
accepted without question.] 

With the possible exception of 
the PanSpechi, no other species 
knew the first thing about Caleban 
and Taprisiot phenomena beyond 
their economic and personal value. 
They were indeed valuable, a fact 
reflected in the prices often paid for 
jumpdoor and long-call services. 
The PanSpechi denied that they 
could explain tljese things, but the 
PanSpechi were notoriously secre- 
tive. They were a species where 
each individual consisted of five 
bodies and only one dominant ego. 
The four reserves lay somewhere in 
a hidden creche. Bildoon had come 
from such a creche, accepting the 
communal ego from a creche-mate 
whose subsequent fate could only 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



17 



be imagined. PanSpechi refused to. 
discuss internal creche matters ex- 
cept to admit what was obvious on 
the surface, that they could grow a 
simulacrum body to mimic most of 
the known species in the ConSen- 
tiency. 

McKie felt himself overcome by 
a momentary pang of xenophobia. 

tVe accept too damned many 
things on the explanations of people 
who could have good reasons for ly- 
ing. 

Keeping his eyes closed, McKie 
sat up. His bedog rippled gently 
against his buttocks. 

Blast and damn the Calebans! 

He’d already done the obvious 
thing, called Fannie Mae, his ‘per- 
sonal friend’ among the Calebans. 
The result had left him wondering if 
he really knew what Calebans 
meant by friendship. 

“Information not permitted.’’ 

What kind of an answer was that? 
Especially when it was the only re- 
sponse he could get. 

Not permitted? 

The basic irritant was an old one: 
BuSab had no real way of applying 
its ‘gentle ministrations’ to the 
Calebans. 

But Calebans had never been 
known to lie. They appeared pain- 
fully, explicitly honest. .as far as 
they could be understood. But they 
obviously withheld information. Not 
permitted! Was it possible they’d let 
themselves be accessories to the 
destruction of a planet and that 
planet’s entire population? 

McKie had to admit it was possi- 
ble. 

They might do it out of ignorance 
or from some stricture of Caleban 
morality which the rest of the Con- 

18 



Sentiency did not share or under- 
stand. Or for some other reason 
which defied translation. They said 
they looked upon all life as ‘pre- 
cious nodes of existence.’ But hints 
at peculiar exceptions remained. 
What was it Fannie Mae had once 
said? 

“Dissolved well, this node.” 

How could you look at an indi- 
vidual life as a “node”? 

If association with Calebans had 
taught him anything it was that un- 
derstanding between species was 
tenuous at best and trying to under- 
stand a Caleban could drive you in- 
sane. In what medium did a node 
dissolve? 

McKie sighed. 

For now, this Dosadi report from 
the Wreave and Laclac agents had 
to be accepted on its own limited 
terms. Powerful people in the 
Gowachin Confederacy had seques- 
tered Humans and Gowachin on an 
unlisted planet. Dosadi — location 
unknown, but the scene of un- 
specified experiments and tests on 
an imprisoned population. This 
much the agents insisted was true. 
If confirmed, it was a shameful act. 
The Frog People would know that, 
surely. Rather that let their shame 
be exposed, they could carry out the 
threat which the two agents re- 
ported: blast the captive planet out 
of existence, the population and all 
of the incriminating evidence with 
it. 

McKie shuddered. 

Dosadi, a planet of thinking crea- 
tures — sentients. If the Gowachin 
carried out their violent threat a 
living world would be reduced to 
blazing gasses and the hot plasma 
of atomic particles. Somewhere, 

GALAXY 



perhaps beyond the reach of other 
eyes, something would strike fire 
against the void. The tragedy would 
require less than a standard second. 
The most concise thought about 
such a catastrophe would require 
a longer time than the actual event. 

But if it happened and the other 
Consentient species received abso- 
lute proof that it had happened 
. .ahhh, then the ConSentiency 
might well be shattered. Who would 
use a jumpdoor, suspecting that he 
might be shunted into some hideous 
experiment? Who would trust a 
neighbor if that neighbor’s habits, 
language and body were different 
from his own? Yes. .there would 
be more than Humans and Go- 
wachin at each others’ throats. 
Planetary extinction was the thing 
all the species feared most. Bildoon 
realized this. The threat to this mys- 
terious Dosadi was a threat to all. 

McKie could not shake the terri- 
ble image from his mind: an explo- 
sion, a bright blink stretching to- 
ward its own darkness. And if the 
ConSentiency learned of it ... in 
that instant before their universe 
crumbled like a cliff dislodged in a 
lightning bolt, what excuses would 
be offered for the failure of reason 
to prevent such a thing? 

Reason? 

McKie shook his head, opened 
his eyes. It was useless to dwell on 
the worst prospects. He allowed the 
apartment’s sleep gloom to invade 
his senses, absorbed the familiar 
presence of his surroundings. 

I’m a Saboteur Extraordinare and 
I’ve a job to do. 

It helped to think of Dosadi that 
way. Solutions to problems often 
depended upon the will to succeed, 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



upon sharpened skills and multiple 
resources. BuSab owned those re- 
sources and those skills. 

McKie stretched his arms high 
over his head, twisted his blocky 
torso. The bedog rippled with plea- 
sure at his movements. He whistled 
softly and suffered the kindling of 
morning light as the apartment’s 
window controls responded. A 
yawn stretched his mouth. He slid 
from the bedog and padded across 
to the window. The view stretched 
away beneath a sky like smudged 
blue paper. He star^ out across the 
spires and rooftops of Central Cen- 
tral. Here lay the heart of the 
domine planet from which the 
Bureau of Sabotage spread its mul- 
tifarious tentacles. 

He blinked at the brightness, took 
a deep breath. 

The Bureau. The omnipresent, 
omniscient, omnivorous Bureau. 
The one source of unmonitored 
governmental violence remaining in 
the ConSentiency. Here lay the 
norm against which sanity measured 
itself. Each choice made here de- 
manded utmost delicacy. Their 
common enemy was that never- 
ending sentient yearning for abso- 
lutes. And each hour of every wak- 
ing workday BuSab in all of its 
parts asked itself: 

“What are we if we succumb to 
unbridled violence?” 

The answer was there in deepest 
awareness: 

“Then we are useless.” 
Consentient government worked 
because, no matter how they de- 
fined it, the participants believed in 
a common justice personally 
achievable. The Government 
worked because BuSab sat at its 



19 



core like a terrible watchdog able to 
attack itself or any seat of power 
with a delicately balanced immu- 
nity. Government worked because 
there were places where it could not 
act without being chopped off. An 
appeal to BuSab made the indi- 
vidual as powerful as the ConSen- 
tiency. It all came down to the cyn- 
ical, self-effacing behavior of the 
carefully chosen BuSab tentacles. 

/ don’t feel much like a BuSab 
tentacle this morning, McKie 
thought. 

In his advancing years, he’d often 
experienced such mornings. He had 
a personal way of dealing with this 
mood: he buried himself in work. 

McKie turned, crossed to the baf- 
fle into his bath where he turned his 
body over to the programmed 
ministrations of his morning toilet. 
The psyche-mirror on the bath’s far 
wall reflected his body while it 
examined and adjusted to his inter- 
nal conditions. His eyes told him he 
was still a squat, dark-skinned 
gnome of a Human with red hair, 
features so large they suggested an 
impossible kinship with the Frog 
People of the Gowachin. The mirror 
did not reflect his mind, considered 
by many to be the sharpest legal 
device in the ConSentiency. 

The Daily Schedule began play- 
ing to McKie as he emerged from 
the bath. The DS suited its tone to 
his movements and the combined 
analysis of his psychophysical con- 
dition. 

“Good morning, ser,” it fluted 
in a cheerful voice. 

McKie, who could interpret the 
analysis of his mood from the DS 
tone, put down a flash of resent- 
ment. Of course he felt angry and 

20 



concerned. Who wouldn’t under 
these circumstances? 

“Good morning, you dumb in- 
animate object,” he growled. He 
slipped into a supple armored pull- 
over, dull green and with the out- 
ward appearance of cloth. 

The DS waited for his head to 
emerge. 

“You wanted to be reminded, 
ser, that there is a full conference of 
the Bureau Directorate at nine local 
this morning, but the. .” 

“Of all the stupid. .” McKie’s 
interruption stopped the DS. He’d 
been meaning for some time to re- 
program the damned thing. No mat- 
ter how carefully you set them, they 
always got out of phase. He didn’t 
bother to bridle his mood, merely 
spoke the key words in full emo- 
tional spate: “Now you hear me, 
machine: Don’t you ever again 
choose that buddy-buddy conversa- 
tional pattern when I’m in this 
mood! I want nothing less than a 
reminder of that conference. When 
you list such a reminder don’t even 
suggest remotely that it’s my wish. 
Understood?” 

“Your admonition recorded and 
new program instituted, ser.” The 
DS adopted a brisk, matter-of-fact 
tone as it continued: “There is a 
new reason for alluding to the con- 
ference.” 

“Well, get on with it.” 

McKie pulled on a pair of green 
shorts and matching kilt of armored 
material identical to that of the pull- 
over. 

The DS continued: 

“The conference was alluded to, 
ser, as introduction to a new datum: 
you have been asked not to attend.” 

McKie, bending to fit his feet 

GALAXY 



into self-powered racing boots, hesi- 
tated, then: 

“But they’re still going to have a 
showdown meeting with all the 
Gowachin in the Bureau?” 

“No mention of that, ser. The 
message was that you are to depart 
immediately this morning on the 
field assignment which was discus- 
sed with you. Code Geevee was in- 
voked. An unspecified Gowachin 
Phylum has asked that you proceed 
at once to their home planet. That 
would be Tandaloor. You are to 
consult there on a problem of a 
legal nature.” 

McKie finished fitting the boots, 
straightened. He could feel all of 
his ninety-plus years as though 
there’d been no geriatric interven- 
tion. Geevee invoked a billion kinds 
of hell. It put him on his own with 
but one shopside backup facility: a 
Taprisiot monitor. He’d have his 
own Taprisiot link sitting safely 
here on CC while he went out and 
risked his vulnerable flesh. The 
Taprisiot served only one function: 
to note his death and record every 
aspect of his final moments — every 
thought, every memory. This would 
be part of the next agent’s briefing. 
And the next agent would get his 
own Taprisiot monitor etcetera, et- 
cetera, etcetera. BuSab was 
notorious for gnawing away at its 
problems. The Bureau never gave 
up. But the astronomical cost of 
such a Taprisiot monitor left the 
operative so gifted with only one 
conclusion. Odds were not in his 
favor. There’d be no accolades, no 
cemetery rites for a dead 
hero . probably not even the 
physical substance of a hero for pri- 
vate grieving. 



McKie felt less and less heroic by 
the minute. 

Heroism was for fools and BuSab 
agents were not employed for their 
foolishness. He saw the reasoning, 
though. He was the best qualified 
non-Gowachin for dealing with the 
Gowachin. He looked at the nearest 
DS voder. 

“Was it suggested that someone 
doesn’t want me at that confer- 
ence?” 

“There was no such specula- 
tion.” 

“Who gave you this message?” 
“Bildoon. Verified voiceprint. 
He asked that your sleep not be in- 
terrupted, that the message be given 
to you on awakening.” 

“Did he say he’d call back or ask 
me to call him?” 

“No.” 

“Did Bildoon mention Dosadi?” 
“He said the Dosadi problem is 
unchanged. Dosadi is not in my 
banks, ser. Did you wish me to 
seek more info. .” 

“No! I’m to leave immediately?” 
“Bildoon said your orders have 
been cut. In relationship to Dosadi, 
he said, and these are his exact 
words: The worst is probable. They 
have all the motivation required.’ ” 
McKie ruminated aloud: “All the 
motivation . selfish interest or 
fear. .” 

“Ser, are you inquiring of. .” 
“No, you stupid machine! I’m 
thinking out loud. People do that. 
We have to sort things out in our 
heads, put a proper evaluation on 
available data.” 

“You do it with extreme ineffi- 
ciency.” 

This startled McKie into a flash 
of anger. “But this job takes a sen- 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



21 



tient, a person, not a machine! Only 
a person can make the responsible 
decision. And I’m the only agent 
who understands them sufficiently.” 

“Why not set a Gowachin agent 
to ferret out their. .” 

“So you’ve worked it out?” 

“It was not difficult, even for a 
machine. Sufficient clues were pro- 
vided. And since you’ll get a Tap- 
risiot monitor, the project involves 
danger to your person. While I do 
not have specifics about Dosadi, the 
clear inference is that the Gowachin 
have engaged in questionable activ- 
ity. Let me remind McKie that the 
Gowachin do not admit guilt easily. 
Very few non-Gowachin are con- 
sidered by them to be worthy of 
their company and confider.ee. They 
do not like to feel dependent upon 
non-Gowachin. In fact, no 
Gowachin enjoys any dependent 
condition, not even when dependent 
upon another Gowachin. This is at 
the root of their law.” 

This was a more emotionally- 
loaded conversation than McKie had 
ever before heard from his DS. 
Perhaps his constant refusal to ac- 
cept the thing on a personal an- 
thropomorphic basis had forced it 
into this adaptation. He suddenly 
felt almost shy with the DS. What it 
had said was pertinent, and more 
than that, vitally important in a par- 
ticular way: chosen to help him to 
the extent the DS was capable. In 
McKie’s thoughts, the DS was sud- 
denly transformed into a valued 
confidante. 

As though it knew his thoughts, 
the DS said: 

“I’m still a machine. You are in- 
efficient, but as you have correctly" 
stated you have ways of arriving at 

22 



accuracy which machines do not 
understand. We can on- 
ly .. guess, and we are not really 
programmed to guess unless specifi- 
cally ordered to do so on a given 
occasion. Trust yourself.” 

“But you’d rather 1 were not kill- 
ed?” 

“That is my program.” 

“Do you have any more helpful 
suggestions?” 

“You would be advised to waste 
as little time as possible here. There 
was a tone of urgency in Bildoon’s 
voice.” 

McKie stared at the nearest 
voder. Urgency in Bildoon’s voice? 
Even under the most urgent neces- 
sity, Bildoon had never sounded ur- 
gent to McKie. Certainly, Dosadi 
could be an urgent matter, 
but. Why should that sound a 
sour note? 

“Are you sure he sounded ur- 
gent?” 

“He spoke rapidly and with ob- 
vious tension.” 

“Truthful?” 

“The tone-spikes lead to that 
conclusion.” 

McKie shook his head. Some- 
thing about Bildoon’s behavior in 
this matter didn’t ring true, but 
whatever it was it escaped the 
sophisticated reading circuits of the 
DS. 

And my circuits, too. 

Still troubled, McKie ordered the 
DS to assemble a full travel kit and 
to read out the rest of the schedule. 
He moved to the tool cupboard be- 
side his bath baffle as the DS began 
reeling off the schedule. 

His day was to start with the 
Taprisiot appointment. He listened 
with only part of his attention, tak- 

GALAXY 



ing care to check the toolkit as the 
DS assembled it. There were plas- 
tipiks. He handled them gently as 
they deserved. A selection of stims 
followed. He rejected these, count- 
ing on the implanted sense/muscle 
amplifiers which increased the 
capabilities of senior BuSab agents. 
Explosives in various denominations 
went into the kit — raygens, pen- 
trates. Very careful with these 
dangerous items. He accepted mul- 
tilenses, a wad of uniflesh with 
matching mediskin, solvos, minipu- 
ter. The DS extruded a life-monitor 
bead for the Taprisiot linkage. He 
swallowed it to give the bead time 
to anchor in his stomach before the 
Taprisiot appointment. A holoscan 
and matching blanks were accepted, 
as were ruptors and comparators. 
He rejected the adapter for simula- 
tion of target identities. It was 
doubtful he’d have time or facilities 
for such sophisticated refinements. 
Better to trust his own instincts. 

Presently, he sealed the kit in its 
wallet, concealed the wallet in a 
pocket. The DS had gone rambling 
on: 

“. .and you’ll arrive on Tan- 
daloor at a place called Holy Run- 
ning. The time there will be early 
afternoon.” 

Holy Running! 

McKie riveted his attention to 
this datum. A Gowachin saying 
skittered through his mind: ‘The 
Law is a blind guide, a pot of bitter 
water. The Law is a deadly contest 
which can change as waves 
change.’ 

No doubt of what had led his 
thoughts into that path. Holy Run- 
ning was the place of Gowachin 
myth. Here, so their stories said. 



lived Mrreg, the monster who had 
set the immutable pattern of 
Gowachin character. 

And now, McKie suspected he 
knew which Gowachin Phylum had 
summoned him. It could be any one 
of five Phyla at Holy Running but 
he felt certain it’d be the worst of 
those five — the most unpredictable, 
the most powerful, the most feared. 
Where else could a thing such as 
Dosadi originate? 

McKie addressed his DS: 

“Send in my breakfast. Please 
record that the condemned person 
ate a hearty breakfast.” 

The DS, programmed to recog- 
nize rhetoric for which there was no 
competent response, remained silent 
while complying.

— The Gowachin Primary 



By mid-afternoon Jedrik saw that 
her gambit had been accepted. A 
surplus of fifty Humans was just the 
right size to be taken by a greedy 
underling. Whoever it was would 
see the possibilities of continuing — 
ten here, thirty there. .and because 
of the way she’d introduced this 
flaw, the next people discarded 
would be mostly Humans, but with 
just enough Gowachin to smack of 
retaliation. 

It’d been difficult carrying out 
her daily routine knowing what 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



23 



she’d set in motion. It was all very 
well to accept the fact that you were 
going into danger. When the actual 
moment arrived it always had a dif- 
ferent character. As the subtle and 
not-so-subtle evidence of success 
accumulated, she felt the crazy 
force of it rolling over her. Now 
was the time to think about her true 
power base, the troops who would 
obey her slightest hint, the tight 
communications linkage with the 
Rim, the carefully selected and 
trained lieutenants. Now was the 
time to think about McKie slipping 
so smoothly into her trap. She con- 
cealed elation behind a facade of 
anger. They’d expect her to be an- 
gry- 

The evidence began with a 
slowed response at her computer 
terminal. Someone was monitoring. 
Whoever had taken her bait wanted 
to be certain she was expendable. 
Wouldn’t want to eliminate some- 
one and then discover that the 
eliminated someone was essential to 
the power structure. She’d made 
damned sure to cut a wide swath 
into a region which could be made 
non-essential. 

The micro-second delay from the 
monitoring triggered a disconnect 
on her tell-tale circuit, removing the 
evidence of her preparations before 
anyone could find it. She didn’t 
think there’d be that much caution 
in anyone who’d accept this gambit 
but unnecessary chances weren’t 
part of her plan. She removed the 
tell-tale timer and lockedll away in 
one of the filing cabinets, there to 
be destroyed with the other evi- 
dence when the Elector’s toads 
came prying. The lonely blue flash 
would be confined by metal walls 

24 



which would heat to a nice blood 
red before lapsing into slag and 
ashes. 

In the next stage, people averted 
their faces as they walked past her 
office doorway. 

Ahhh, the accuracy of the 
rumor-trail. 

The avoidance came so naturally: 
a glance at a companion on the 
other side, concentration on material 
in one’s hands, a brisk stride with 
gaze fixed on the corridor’s ends. 
Important business up there. No 
time to stop and chat with Keila 
Jedrik today. 

By the Veil of Heaven! They were 
so transparent! 

A Gowachin walked by examin- 
ing the corridor’s blank opposite 
wall. She knew that Gowachin: one 
of the Elector’s spies. What would 
he tell Elector Broey today? Jedrik 
glared at the Gowachin in secret 
glee. By nightfall, Broey would 
know who’d picked up her gambit 
but it was too small a bite to arouse 
his avarice. He’d merely log the in- 
formation for possible future use. It 
was too early for him to suspect a 
sacrifice move. 

A Human male followed the 
Gowachin. He was intent on the ad- 
justment of his neckline and that, of 
course, precluded a glance at a 
Senior Liaitor in her office. His 
name was Drayjo. Only yesterday, 
Drayjo had made courting gestures, 
bending toward her over this very 
desk to reveal the muscles under his 
light grey coveralls. What did it 
matter that Drayjo no longer saw 
her as a useful conquest. His face 
was a wooden door, closed, locked, 
hiding nothing. 

Avert your face, you clog! 



GALAXY 



When the red light glowed on her 
terminal screen, it came as anti- 
climax. Confirmation that her gambit 
had been accepted by someone who 
would shortly regret it. Communica- 
tion flowed across the screen: 

“Opp SD22240268523ZX.” 

Good old ZX! 

Bad news always developed its 
own coded idiom. She read what 
followed, anticipating every nuance: 
“The Mandate of God having 
been consulted, the following 
supernumerary functions are hereby 
reduced. If your position screen car- 
ries your job title with an underline 
you are included in the reduction. 

‘ 'Senior Liaitor. ’ ’ 

Jedrik clenched her fists in simu- 
lated anger while she glared at the 
underlined words. It was done. 
Opp-Out, the good old Double-0. 
Through its pliable arm, the De- 
moPoI, the Sacred Congregation of 
the Heavenly Veil had struck again. 

None of her elation showed 
through her Dosadi controls. Some- 
one able to see beyond immediate 
gain would note presently that only 
Humans had received this partieular 
good old Double-0. Not one 
Gowachin there. Whoever made 
that observation would come snif- 
fing down the trail she’d deliber- 
ately left. Evidence would accumu- 
late. She thought she knew who 
would read that accumulated evi- 
dence for Broey. It would be Tria. 
It was not yet time for Tria to enter- 
tain doubts. Broey would hear what 
Jedrik wanted him to hear. The 
Dosadi power game would be 
played by Jedrik’s rules then and by 
the time others learned the rules it’d 
be too late. 

She counted on the factor which 



Broey labeled ‘instability of the 
masses.’ Religious twaddle! 
Dosadi’s masses were unstable only 
in particular ways. Fit a conscious 
■justification to their innermost un- 
conscious demands and they became 
a predictable system which would 
leap into predictable actions — 
especially with a psychotic populace 
whose innermost demands could 
never be faced consciously by the 
individuals. Such a populace re- 
mained highly useful to the in- 
itiates. That was why they main- 
tained the DemoPol with its 
mandate-of-God sample. The tools 
of government were not difficult to 
understand. All you needed was a 
pathway into the system, a place 
where what you did touched a new 
reality. 

Broey would think himself the 
target of her action. More fool he. 

Jedrik pushed back her chair, 
stood and strode to the window 
hardly daring to think about where 
her actions would truly be felt. She 
saw that the sniper’s bullet hadn’t 
even left a mark on the glass. These 
new windows were far superior to 
the old ones which had taken on 
dull streaks and scratches after only 
a few years. 

She stared down at the light on 
the river, carefully preserving this 
moment, prolonging it. 

I won't look up yet, not yet. 

Whoever had accepted her gambit 
would be watching her now. Too 
late! Too late!

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT

Hills, to the fluting inverted- 
stalagmites of the high apartments 
to which the denizens of Chu as- 
pired in their futile dreams. Sunlight 
gleamed from the power bulbs 
which adorned the apartments on 
the hills. The great crushing wheel 
of government had its hub on those 
hills, but the impetus for that wheel 
had originated elsewhere. 

Now, having prolonged the mo- 
ment while anticipation enriched it, 
Jedrik lifted her gaze to that region 
above the Council Hills, to the 
sparkling streamers and grey glow- 
ing of the barrier veil, to the God 
Wall which englobed her planet in 
its impenetrable shell. The Veil of 
Heaven looked the way it always 
looked in this light. There was no 
apparent change. But she knew what 
she had done. 

Jedrik was aware of subtle in- 
struments which revealed other suns 
and galaxies beyond the God Wall, 
places where other planets must 
exist, but her people had only this one 
planet. That barrier up there and 
whoever had created it insured this 
isolation. Her eyes blurred with 
quick tears which she wiped away 
with real anger at herself. Let Broey 
and his toads believe themselves the 
only objects of her anger. She 
would carve a way beyond them 
through that deadly veil. No one on 
Dosadi would ever again cower be- 
neath the hidden powers who lived 
in the sky! 

She lowered her gaze to the car- 
pet of factories and warrens. Some 
of the defensive walls were faintly 
visible in the layers of smoke which 
blanketed the teeming scramble of 
life upon which the city fed. The 
smoke erased fine details to separate 



the apartment hills from the earth. 
Above the smoke, the fluted build- 
ings became more a part of sky than 
of ground. Even the ledged set-back 
walls of the canyon within which 
Chu created its sanctuary were no 
longer attached to the ground, but 
floated separate from this place 
where people could survive to a 
riper maturity on Dosadi. The 
smoke dulled the greens of ledges 
and Rim where the Rabble waged a 
losing battle for survival. Twenty 
years was old out there. In that 
pressure, they fought for a chance 
to enter Chu’s protective confines 
by any means available, even wel- 
coming the opportunity to eat gar- 
bage from which the poisons of 
this planet had been removed. The 
worst of Chu was better than their 
best, which only proved that the 
conditions of hell were relative. 

I seek escape through the God 
Wall for the same reasons the Rab- 
ble seeks entrance to Chu. 

In Jedrik’ s mind lay a graph with 
an undulant line. It combined many 
influences: Chu’s precious food 
cycle and economics, Rim incur- 
sions, spots which flowed across 
their veiled sun, subtle planetary 
movements, atmospheric electricity, 
gravitational flows, magnetronic 
fluctuations, the dance of numbers 
in the Liaitor banks, the seemingly 
random play of cosmic rays, the 
shifting colors in the God 
Wall . and mysterious jolts to 
the entire system which commanded 
her most concentrated attention. 
There could be only one source for 
such jolts: a manipulative in- 
telligence outside the planetary in- 
fluence of Dosadi. She called that 
force ‘X’ but she had broken ‘X’ 



26 



GALAXY 



into components. One component 
was a simulation model of Elector 
Broey which she carried firmly in 
her head, not needing any of the 
mechanical devices for reading such 
things. ‘X’ and all of its compo- 
nents were as real as anything else 
on the chart in her mind. By their 
interplay she read them. 

Jedrik addressed herself silently 
to ‘X’: 

By your actions I know you and 
you are vulnerable . 

Despite all of the Sacred Congre- 
gation’s prattle, Jedrik and her 
people knew the God Wall had been 
put there for a specific purpose. It 
was the purpose which pressed liv- 
ing flesh into Chu from the Rim. It 
was the purpose which jammed too 
many people into too little space 
while it frustrated all attempts to 
spread into any other potential 
sanctuary. It was the purpose which 
created people who possessed that 
terrifying mental template which 
could trade flesh for 
flesh . Gowachin or Human. 
Many clues revealed themselves 
around her and came through that 
radiance in the sky, but she refused 
as yet to make a coherent whole out 
of that purpose. Not yet. 

/ need this McKie! 

With a Jedrik-maintained tenac- 
ity, her people knew that the re- 
gions beyond the barrier veil were 
not heaven or hell. Dosadi was hell, 
but it was a created hell. 

We will know soon . soon. 

This moment had been almost 
nine Dosadi generations in prepara- 
tion: the careful breeding of a 
specific individual who carried in 
one body the talents required for 
this assault on ‘X,’ the exquisitely 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



detailed education of that weapon- 
in-fleshly-form . and there’d 
been all the rest of it — whispers, 
unremarked observations in clandes- 
tine leaflets, help for people who 
held particular ideas and elimination 
of others whose concepts 
obstructed, the building of a Rim- 
Warren communications network, 
the slow and secret assembly of a 
military force to match the others 
which balanced themselves at the 
peaks of Dosadi power. All of 
these things and much more had 
prepared the way for those numbers 
introduced into her computer termi- 
nal. The ones who appeared to rule 
Dosadi and the ones behind them 
who moved the powerful of Dosadi- 
like puppets— those ones could be 
read in many ways and this time the 
rulers, both visible and hidden, had 
made one calculation while Jedrik 
had made another calculation. 

Again, she looked up at the God 
Wall. 

You out there! Keila Jedrik knows 
you’re there. And you can be 
baited, you can be trapped. You are 
slow and stupid. And you think / 
don’t know how to use your McKie. 
Ahhh, sky demons, McKie will open 
your veil for me. My life’s a wrath 
and you’re the objects of my wrath. 
I dare what you would not. 

Nothing of this revealed itself on 
her face nor in any movement of 
her body.

— Gowachin Admonition 



27 



McKie began speaking as he en- 
tered the Phylum sanctus: 

“I’m Jorj X. McKie of the 
Bureau of Sabotage.” 

Name and primary allegiance, 
that was the drill. If he’d been a 
Gowachin, he’d have named his 
Phylum or would’ve favored the 
room with a long blink to reveal the 
identifying Phylum tatoo on his 
eyelids. As a non-Gowachin, he 
didn’t need a tatoo. 

He held his right hand extended 
in the Gowachin peace sign, palm 
down and fingers wide to show that 
he held no weapon there and had 
not extended his claws. Even as he 
entered, he smiled, knowing the ef- 
fect this would have on any 
Gowachin here. In a rare mood of 
candor, one of his old Gowachin 
teachers had once explained the ef- 
fect of a smiling McKie. 

“We feel our bones age. It is a 
very uncomfortable experience.” 
McKie understood the reason for 
this. He possessed a thick, muscular 
body — a swimmer’s body with light 
mahogany skin. He walked with a 
swimmer’s rolling gait. There were 
Polynesians in his Old Terran ances- 
try, this much was known in the 
Family Annals. Wide lips and a flat 
nose dominated his face; the eyes 
were large and placidly brown. 
There was a final genetic ornamen- 
tation to confound the Gowachin: 
red hair. He was the Human equiva- 
lent of the greenstone sculpture 
found in every Phylum house here 
on Tandaloor. McKie possessed the 
face and body of the Frog God, the 
Giver of Law. 

As his old teacher had explained, 
no Gowachin ever fully escaped 
feelings of awe in McKie’ s pres-

ence, especially when McKie 
smiled. They were forced to hide a 
response which went back to that 
admonition which every Gowachin 
learned while still clinging to his 
mother’s back. 

Arm yourselves! McKie thought. 

Still smiling, he stopped after the 
prescribed eight paces, glanced once 
around the room then narrowed his 
attention. 

Green crystal walls confined the 
sanctus. It was not a large space, a 
gentle oval of perhaps twenty 
meters in its longest dimension. A 
single oval window admitted warm 
afternoon light from Tandaloor’s 
golden sun. The glowing yellow 
created a contrived spiritual ring di- 
rectly ahead of McKie. The light 
focused on an aged Gowachin 
seated in a brown chairdog which 
had spread itself wide to support his 
elbows and webbed fingers. 

At the Gowachin’s right hand 
stood an exquisitely wrought 
wooden swingdesk on a scrollwork 
stand. The desk held one object: a 
metal box of dull blue about fifteen 
centimeters long, ten wide and six 
deep. Standing behind the blue box 
in the servant-guard position was a 
red-robed Wreave, her fighting 
mandibles tucked neatly into the 
lower folds of her facial slit. 

This Phylum was initiating a 
Wreave! 

The realization filled McKie with 
disquiet. Bildoon had not warned 
him about Wreaves on Tandaloor. 
The Wreave indicated a sad shift 
among the Gowachin toward a par- 
ticular kind of violence. Wreaves 
never danced for joy, only for 
death. And this was the most danger- 
ous of Wreaves, a female, recog-

not even suspected that there’d been 
amusement for anyone in that first 
case. Present circumstances argued 
for truthfulness from the old 
Gowachin, however. Recalling that 
first case, McKie tried to reassess it 
in the light of this revelation. He 
remembered the case well. The 
Gowachin had charged a Low 
Magister named Klodik with break- 
ing his most sacred vows in an 
issue of justice. Klodik’s crime was 
the release of thirty-one fellow 
Gowachin from their primary al- 
legiance to Gowachin Law and the 
purpose of that was to qualify the 
thirty-one for service in BuSab. The 
hapless prosecutor, a much admired 
Legum named Pirgutud, had aspired 
to Klodik’s position and had made 
the mistake of trying for a direct 
conviction. McKie had thought at 

32 



the time that the wiser choice 
would’ve been to attempt discredit- 
ing the legal structure under which 
Klodik had been arraigned. 

This would have thrown judge- 
ment into the area of popular choice 
and there’d been no doubt that 
Klodik’s early demise would’ve 
been popular. Seeing this opening, 
McKie had attacked the prosecutor 
as a legalist, a stickler, one who 
preferred Old Law. Victory had 
been relatively easy. 

When it had come to the knife, 
however, McKie had found himself 
profoundly reluctant. There’d been 
no question of selling Pirgutud back 
to his own Phylum. BuSab had 
needed a non-Gowachin Le- 
gum ... the whole non-Gowachin 
universe had needed this. The few 
other non-Gowachin who’d attained 
Legum status were all dead, every 
last one of them in the Courtarena. 
A current of animosity toward the 
Gowachin worlds had been grow- 
ing. Suspicion fed on suspicion. 

Pirgutud had to die in the tradi- 
tional, the formal way. He’d known 
it perhaps better than McKie. Pir- 
gutud, as required, had bared the 
heart area beside hi's stomach and' 
clasped his hands behind his head. 
This extruded the stomach circle, 
providing a point of reference. 

The purely academic anatomy 
lessons and the practice sessions on 
lifelike dummies had come to 
deadly focus. 

“Just to the left of the stomach 
circle imagine a small triangle with 
an apex at the center of the stomach 
circle extended horizontally and the 
base even with the bottom of the 
stomach circle. Strike into the lower 
outside comer of this triangle and 

GALAXY 



slightly upward toward the mid- 
line.’’ 

About the only satisfaction 
McKie had found in the vent was 
that Pirgutud had died cleanly and 
quickly with one stroke. McKie had 
not entered Gowachin Law as a 
“hacker.” 

What had there been in that case 
and its bloody ending to amuse the 
Gowachin? The answer filled 
McKie with a profound sense of 
peril. 

The Gowachin were amused at 
themselves because they had so mis- 
judged me! But I’d planned all 
along for them to misjudge me. 
That was what amused them! 

Having provided McKie with a 
polite pericxl for reflection, the old 
Gowachin continued: 

“I’d bet against you, McKie. The 
odds, you understand? You de- 
lighted me nonetheless. You in- 
structed us while winning your case 
in a classic manner which would’ve 
done credit to the best of us. That is 
one of the Law’s purposes, of 
course: to test the qualities of those 
who choose to employ it. Now what 
did you expect to find when you 
answered our latest summons to 
Tandaloor?” 

The question’s abrupt shift into 
the present almost caught McKie by 
surprise. 

I’ve been too long away from the 
Gowachin^ he thought. I can’t relax 
even for an instant. 

It was almost a palpable thing: if 
he missed a single beat of the 
rhythms in this room, he and an en- 
tire planet could fall before 
Gowachin judgement. For a civiliza- 
tion which based its law on the 
Courtarena ^here any participant 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 




possible. McKie chose his next 
words with life-and-death care. 

“You summoned me, that is true, 
but I came on official business of 
my Bureau. It’s the Bureau’s expec- 
tations which concern me.” 

‘ ‘Then you are in a difficult posi- 
tion because you’re also a Legum of 
the Gowachin Bar subject to our 
demands. Do you know me?” 

This was a Magister, a 
Foremost-Speaker from the ‘Phylum 
of Phylums,’ no doubt of it. He was 
a survivor in one of the most cruel 
traditions known to the sentient uni- 
verse. His abilities and resources 
were formidable and he was on his 
home ground. McKie chose the 
cautious response. 

“On my arrival I was told to 
come to this place at this time. That 
is what I know.” 



33 



‘The least thing that is known 
shall govern your acts.’ This was 
the course of evidence for the 
Gowachin. McKie’s response put a 
legal burden on his questioner. 

The old Gowachin’s hands 
clutched with pleasure at the level 
of artistry to which this contest had 
risen. There was a momentary si- 
lence during which Ceylang 
gathered her robe tightly and moved 
even closer to the swingdesk. Now, 
there was tension in her move- 
ments. The Magister stirred, said: 

“I have the disgusting honor to 
be High Magister of the Running 
Phylum, Aritch by name.” 

As he spoke, his right hand thrust 
out, took the blue box and dropped 
it into McKie’s lap. “I place the 
binding oath upon you in the name 
of the book!” 

As McKie had expected, it was 
done swiftly. He had the box in his 
hands while the final words of the 
ancient legal challenge were ringing 
in his ears. No matter the ConSen- 
tient modifications of Gowachin 
Law which might apply in this situ- 
ation, he was caught in a convo- 
luted legal maneuvering. The metal 
of the box felt cold against his fin- 
gers. They’d confronted him with 
the High Magister. The Gowachin 
were dispensing with many pre- 
liminaries. This spoke of time pres- 
sures and a particular assessment of 
their own predicament. McKie re- 
minded himself that he was dealing 
with people who found pleasure in 
their own failures, could be amused 
by death in the Courtarena, whose 
most consummate pleasure came 
when the currents of their own Law 
were changed artistically. 

McKie spoke with the careful 

34 



formality which ritual required if he 
were to emerge alive from this 
room. 

‘‘Two wrongs may cancel each 
other. Therefore, let those who do 
wrong do it together. That is the 
true purpose of Law.” 

Gently, McKie released the sim- 
ple swing catch on the box, lifted 
the lid to verify the contents. This 
must be done with precise attention 
to formal details. A bitter musty 
odor touched his nostrils as the lid 
lifted. The box held what he’d ex- 
pected: the book, the knife, the 
rock. It occurred to McKie then that 
he was holding the original of all 
such boxes. It was a thing of enor- 
mous antiquity — thousands upon 
thousands of standard years. 
Gowachin professed the belief that 
the Frog God had created this box, 
this very box, and its contents as a 
model, the symbol of ‘the only 
workable Law.’ 

Careful to do it with his right 
hand, McKie touched each item of 
the box in its turn, closed the lid 
and latched it. As he did this, he 
felt that he stepped into a ghostly 
parade of Legums, names imbedded 
in the minstrel chronology of 
Gowachin history. 

‘Bishkar who concealed her 
eggs. .’ 

‘Kondush the Diver. 

‘Dritaik who sprang from the 
marsh and laughed at Mrreg. .’ 

‘Tonkeel of the hidden knife. .’ 

McKie wondered then how they 
would sing about him. Would it be 
‘McKie the blunderer’! His 
thoughts raced through review of 
the necessities. The primary neces- 
sity was Aritch. Little was known 
about this High Magister outside the 



GALAXY 



Gowachin Federation, but it was 
said that he’d once won a case by 
finding a popular bias which al- 
lowed him to lull a judge. The 
commentary on this coup said 
Aritch ‘‘embraced the Law in the 
same way that salt dissolves jn wa- 
ter.” To the initiates, this meant 
Aritch personified the basic 
Gowachin attitude toward their 
Law, ‘respectful disrespect.’ It was 
a peculiar form of sanctity. Every 
movement of your body was as im- 
portant as your words. The Go- 
wachin made it an aphorism. 

“You hold your life in your 
mouth when you enter the court- 
arena.” 

They provided legal ways to kill 
any participant — judges, legums, 
clients. But it must be done with 
exquisite legal finesse, with its jus- 
tifications apparent to all observer^, 
and with the most delicate timing. 
Above all; one could kill in the 
arena only when no other choice 
offered the same worshipful disre- 
spect for Gowachin Law. Even 
while changing the Law you were 
required to revere its sanctity. 

When you entered the Courtarena 
you had to feel that peculiar sanctity 
in every fiber. The forms. .the 
forms. .the forms. With that 
blue box in his hands, the deadly 
forms of Gowachin Law dominated 
every movement, every word. 

Knowing McKie was not 
Gowachin-bom, Aritch was putting 
time pressures on him, hoping for 
an immediate flaw. They didn’t 
want this Dosadi matter in the 
arena. That was the immediate con- 
test. And if it did get to the are- 
na. .well, the crucial matter would 
be selection of the judges. Judges 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



were chosen with great care. Both 
sides maneuvered in this, being 
cautious not to intrude a profes- 
sional legalist onto the bench. 
Judges could represent those whom 
the Law had offended. They could 
be private citizens in any number 
satisfactory to the opposing forces. 
Judges could be (and often were) 
chosen for their special knowledge 
of a case at hand. But here you 
were forced to weigh the subtleties 
of prejudgement. Gowachin Law 
made a special distinction between 
prejudgement and bias. 

McKie considered this. 

The interpretation of bias was: 
“If I can rule for a particular side I 
will do so.” 

For prejudgement: “No matter 
what happens in the arena I will 
rule for a particular side.” 

Bias was permitted, but not pre- 
judgement. 

Aritch was the first problem, his 
possible prejudgements, his bias, 
his inborn and most deeply con- 
ditioned attitudes. In his deepest 
feelings he would look down on all 
non-Gowachin legal systems as 
“devices to weaken personal char- 
acter through appeals to illogic, irra- 
tionality and to ego-centered self- 
ishness in the name of high pur- 
pose.” 

If Dosadi came to the arena it 
would be tried under modified 
Gowachin Law. The modifications 
were a thorn in the Gowachin skin. 
They represented concessions made 
for entrance into the ConSentiency. 
Periodically, the Gowachin tried to 
make their Law the basis for all 
Consentient Law. 

McKie recalled that a Gowachin 
had once said of ConSentient Law: 

35 



“It fosters greed, discontent and 
competitiveness not based on excel- 
lence but on appeals to prejudice 
and materialism.” 

Abruptly, McKie remembered 
that this was a quotation attributed 
to Aritch, High Magister of the 
Running Phylum. Were there even 
more deeply hidden motives in what 
the Gowachin did here? 

Showing signs of impatience, 
Aritch, inhaling deeply through his 
chest ventricles, said: 

“You are now my Legum. To be 
convicted is to go free because this 
marks you as an enemy of all 
government. I know you to be such 
an enemy, McKie.” 

“You know me,” McKie agreed. 

It was more than ritual response 
and obedience to forms; it was 
truth. But it required great effort for 
McKie to speak it calmly. In the 
almost fifty years since he’d been 
admitted to the Gowachin Bar, he’d 
served that ancient legal structure 
four times in the Courtarena, a 
minor record among the ordinary 
Legums. Each time, his personal 
survival had been in the balance. In 
all of its stages, this contest was a 
deadly battle. The loser’s life be- 
fonged to the winner and could be 
taken at the winner’s discretion. On 
rare occasions, the loser might be 
sold back to his own Phylum as a 
menial. Even the losers disliked this 
choice. 

‘Better clean death than dirty 
life.’ 

The blood-encrusted knife in the 
blue box testified to the more popu- 
lar outcome. It was a practice which 
made for rare litigation and memora- 
ble court performances. 

Aritch, speaking with eyes closed 



and the Running Phylum tatoos 
formally displayed, brought their 
encounter to its testing point. 

“Now, McKie, «.you will tell me 
what official matters of the Bureau 
of Sabotage bring you to the 
Gowachin Federation.”

Law must retain useful ways to 
break with traditional forms be- 
cause nothing is more certain 
than that the forms of Law re- 
main when all justice is gone. 

— Gowachin Aphorism 



He was tall for a Dosadi 
Gowachin but fat and ungroomed. 
His feet shuffled when he walked 
and there was a permanent stoop to 
his shoulders. A flexing wheezing 
overcame his chest ventricles when 
he became excited. He knew this 
and was aware that those around 
him knew it. He often used this 
characteristic as a warning, remind- 
ing people that no Dosadi held more 
power than he, and that power was 
deadly. All Dosadi knew his name: 
Broey. And very few misinterpreted 
the fact that he’d come up through 
the Sacred Congregation of the 
Heavenly Veil to his post as chief 
steward of Control: The Elector. 
His private army was Dosadi’s 
largest, most efficient and best 
armed. Broey’s intelligence corps 
was a thing to invoke fear and ad- 
miration. He maintained a fortified 
suite atop his headquarters building, 
a structure of stone and plasteel 
which fronted the main arm of the 



36 



GALAXY 



river in the heart of Chu. Around 
this core, the twisting walled fortifi- 
cations of the city stepped outward 
in concentric rings. The only en- 
trance to Broey’s citadel was 
through a guarded Tube Gate in a 
sub-basement, designated TG One. 
TG One admitted the. select of the 
select and no others. 

In the forenoon, the ledges out- 
side Broey’s windows were a roost- 
ing place for carrion birds which 
occupied a special niche on Dosadi. 
Since the Lords of the Veil forbade 
the eating of sentient flesh by sen- 
tient, this task devolved upon the 
birds. Flesh from the people of Chu 
and even from the Rim carried 
fewer of the planet’s heavy metals. 
The carrion birds prospered. A 
flock of them strutted along Broey’s 
le4ge coughing, squawking, defecat- 
ing, brushing against each other 
with avian insolence While they 
watched the outlying streets for 
signs of food. They also watched 
the Rim, but it had been temporar- 
ily denied to them by a sonabarrier. 
Bird sounds came through a voder 
into one of the suite’s eight rooms. 
This was a' yellow-green space 
about ten meters long and six wide 
occupied by Broey and twp Hu- 
mans. 

Broey uttered a mild expletive at 
the bird noise. The confounded crea- 
tures interfered with clear thinking. 
He shuffled to the window and si- 
lenced the voder. In the sudden 
quiet he looked out at the city’s 
perimeter and the lower ledges of 
the enclosing cliffs. Another Rim 
foray had been repulsed out there in 
the night. Broey had made a per- 
sonal inspection in a convoy of ar- 
mored vehicles earlier. The troops 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



liked it that he occasionally shared 
their dangers. The carrion birds al- 
ready had cleaned up most of the 
mess by the time the armored col- 
umn swept through. The flat back 
structure of Gowachin who had no 
front rib cage had been easily dis- 
tinguishable from the white 
framework which had housed 
Human organs. Only a few rags of 
red and green flesh had marked 
where the birds had abandoned their 
feast when the sonabarriers herded 
them away. 

When he considered the sonabar- 
riers, Broey’s thoughts grew hard 
and clear. The sonabarriers were 
one of Gar’s damned affectations! 
Let the birds finish it. 

But Gar insisted a few bodies be 
left around to make the point for the 
Rim survivors that their attacks 
were hopeless. 

The bones by themselves would 
be just as effective. 

Gaf was bloody minded. 

Broey turned and glanced across 
the room pnst his two Human com- 
panions. Two of the walls were 
taken up by charts bearing undulant 
squiggles in many colors. On a 
table at the room’s center lay 
another chart with a single red line. 
The line curved and dipped ending 
almost in the middle of the chart. 
Near this terminus lay a white card 
and, beside it stood a Human male 
statuette with an enormous erection 
which was labeled “Rabble.” It 
was a subversive, forbidden artifact 
of Rim origin. TTie people of the 
Rim knew where their main strength 
lay: breed, breed, breed. 

The two Humans sat facing each 
other across the chart. They fitted 
into the space around them through 



37 



a special absorption. It was as 
though they’d been initiated into the 
secrets of Broey’s citadel through 
an esoteric ritual both forbidding 
and dangerous. 

Broey returned to his chair at the 
head of the table, sat down and 
quietly continued to study his com- 
panions. He experienced amusement 
to feel his fighting claws twitch be- 
neath their finger shields as he 
looked at the two. Yes — trust them 
no more than they trusted him. 
They had their own troops, their 
own spies — they posed real threat to 
Broey but often their help was use- 
ful. Just as often they were a nui- 
sance. 

Quilliam Gar, the Human male 
wh'o sat with his back to the win- 
dows, looked up as Broey resumed 
his seat. Gar snorted, somehow 
conveying that he’d been about to 
silence that voder himself. 

Damned carrion birds! But they 
were useful . useful. 

The Rimbom were always ambi- 
valent about the birds. 

Gar rode his chair as though talk- 
ing down to ranks of the unin- 
formed. He’d come up through the 
educational services in the Convoca- 
tion before joining Broey. Gar was 
thin with an inner emaciation so 
common that few on Dosadi gave it 
any special notice. ^He had the hunt- 
er’s face and eyes, carried his 
eighty-eight years as though they 
were twice that. Hairline wrinkles 
crawled down his cheeks. The bas re- 
lief of veins along the backs of his 
hands and the grey hair betrayed his 
Rim origins, as did a tendency to 
short temper. The Labor Pool green 
of his clothing fooled very few, his 
face was that well known. 



Across from Gar sat his eldest 
daughter and chief lieutenant, Tria. 
She’d placed herself there to watch 
the windows and the cliffs. She’d 
also been observing the carrion 
birds, rather enjoying their sounds. 
It was well to be reminded here of 
what lay beyond the city’s outer 
gates. 

Tria’s face held too much brittle 
sharpness to be considered beautiful 
by any except an occasional 
Gowachin looking for an exotic ex- 
perience or a Warren laborer hoping 
to use her as a step out of peonage. 
She often disconcerted her com- 
panions by a wide-eyed cynical 
stare. She did this with an aristocra- 
tic sureness which commanded at- 
tention. Tria had developed the ges- 
ture for just this purpose. Today, 
she wore the orange with black trim 
of Special Services but without a 
brassard to indicate the branch. She 
knew that this led many to believe 
her Broey’s personal toy, which 
was true but not in the way the cyni- 
cal supposed. Tria understood her 
special value: she possessed . a re- 
markable ability to interpret the 
vagaries of the DemoPol. 

Indicating the red line on the 
chart in front of her, Tria said: 
“She has to be the one. How can 
you doubt it?’’ And she wondered 
why Broey continued to worry at 
the obvious. 

“Keila Jedrik,” Broey said. And 
again: “Keila Jedrik.’’ 

Gar squinted at his daughter. 

“Why would she include herself 
among the fifty who. .’’ 

“She sends us a message,’’ 
Broey said. “I hear it clearly 
now.” He seemed pleased by his 
own thoughts. 



38 



GALAXY 



Gar read something else in the 
Gowachin’s manner. ^ 

“I hope you’re not having her 
killed.” 

“I’m not as quick to anger as are 
you Humans,” Broey said. 

“The usual surveillance?” Gar 
asked. 

“I haven’t decided. You know, 
don’t you, that she lives a rather 
celebate life? Is it that she doesn’t 
enjoy the males of your species?” 

“More likely they don’t enjoy 
her,” Tria said. 

“Interesting. Your breeding 
habits are so peculiar.” 

Tria shot a measuring stare at 
Broey. She wondered why the; 
Gowachin had chosen to wear black 
today. It was a robe-like garment 
cut at a sharp angle from shoulders 
to waist, clearing his ventricles. The 
ventricles revolted her and Broey 
knew this. The very thought of 
them pressing against her. She 
cleared her throat. Broey seldom 
wore black; it was the happy color 
of priestly celebrants. He wore it, 
though, with a remoteness which 
suggested that thoughts passed 
through his mind which no other 
person could experience. 

The exchange between Broey and 
his daughter worried Gar. He could 
not help but feel the oddity, that 
each of them tried to present a 
threatening view of events by with- 
holding some data and coloring 
other data. 

“What if she runs out to the 
Rim?” Gar asked. 

Broey shook his head. 

“Let her go. She’s not one to 
stay on the Rim.” 

“Perhaps we should have her 
picked up,” Gar said. 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



Broey stared at him, then: 

“I’ve gained the distinct impres- 
sion that you’ve some private plan 
in mind. Are you prepared to share 
it?” 

“I’ve no idea what you. .” 
“Enough!” Broey shouted. His 
ventricles wheezed as he inhaled. 
Gar held himself very quiet. 

Broey leaned toward him, noting 
that this exchange amused Tria. 

“It’s too soon to make decisions 
we cannot change! This is a time 
for ambiguity.” 

Irritated by his own display of 
anger, Broey arose and hurried into 
his adjoining office where he locked 
the door. It was obvious that those 
two had no more idea than he 
where Jedrik had gone to ground. 
But it was still his game. She 
couldn’t hide forever. Seated once 
more in his office, he called Se- 
curity. 

“Has Bahrank returned?” 

A senior Gowachin officer hur- 
ried into the screen’s view, looked 
up. 

“Not yet.” 

“What precautions to learn where 
he delivers his cargo?” 

“We know his entry gate. It’ll be 
simple to track him.” 

“I don’t want Gar’s people to 
know what you’re doing.” 
“Understood.” 

“That other matter?” 

“Pcharky may have been the last 
one. He could be dead, too. The 
killers were thorough.” 

“Keep searching.” 

Broey put down a sense of dis- 
quiet. Some very un-Dosadi things 
were happening in Chu . and on 
the Rim. He felt that things occur- 
red which his spies could not un- 



39 



cover. Presently, he returned to the 
more pressing matter. 

“Bahrank is not to be interfered 
with until afterward.” 

“Understood.” 

“Pick him up well clear of his 
delivery point and bring him to your 
section. 1 will interview him per- 
sonallv.” 

“Sir, his addiction to. .” 

“1 know the hold she has on 
him. I’m counting on it.” 

“We’ve not yet secured any of 
that substance, sir, although we’re 
still trying,” 

“1 want success, not excuses. 
Who’s in charge of that?” 

“Kidge, sir. He’s very efficient 
in this. .” 

“Is Kidge available?” 

“One moment, sir. I’ll put him 
on.” 

Kidge had a phlegmatic 
Gowachin face and rumbling voice. 

“Do you want a status report, 
sir?” 

“Yes.” 

“My Rim contacts believe the 
addictive substance is derived from 
a plant called ‘tibac.’ We have no 
prior record of such a plant, but the 
outer Rabble has been cultivating it 
lately. According to my contacts, 
it’s extremely addictive to Humans, 
even more so to us.” 

“No record? What’s its origin? 
Do they say?” 

“1 talked personally to a Human 
who’d recently returned from up- 
river where the outer Rabble report- 
edly has extensive plantations of 
this ‘tibac.’ 1 promised my infor- 
mant a place in the Warrens if he 
provides me with a complete report 
on the stuff and a kilo packet of it. 
This informant says the cultivators 

40 



believe tibac has religious signifi- 
cance. I didn’t see any point in 
exploring that.” 

“When do you expect him to de- 
liver?” 

“By nightfall at the latest.” 

Broey held his silence for a mo- i 
ment. Religious significance. More | 
than likely the plant came from be- 
yond the God Wall then, as Kidge ^ 

implied. But why? What were they 
doing? j 

“Do you have new instructions?” ! 

Kidge asked. 

“Get that substance up to me as 
soon as you can.” 

Kidge fidgeted. He obviously had 
another question but was unwilling 
to ask it. I 

Broey glared at him. 

“Yes? What is it?” 

“Don’t you want the substance 
tested first?’ ’ | 

It was a baffling question. Had ' 

Kidge withheld vital information 
about the dangers of this tibac? One ^ 
never knew from what quarter an at- 
tack might' come. But Kidge was 
held in his own special bondage. He 
knew what could happen to him if I 
he failed Broey. And Jedrik had ' 
handled this stuff. But why had j 

Kidge asked this question? Faced 
with such unknowns, Broey tended 
to withdraw into himself, eyes veil- , 
ed by the nictating membrane while 
he weighed the possibilities. Pre- 
sently, he stirred, looked at Kidge ' 
in the screen. 

“If there’s enough of it, feed 
some to volunteers — both Human I 

and Gowachin. Get the rest of it up 
to me immediately, even while 
you’re testing, but in a sealed con- 
tainer.” 

“Sir, there are rumors about this 
GALAXY 



stuff. It’ll be difficult getting real 
volunteers.” 

“You’ll think of something.” 
Broey broke the connection, re- 
turned to the outer room to make 
his political peace with Gar and 
Tria. He was not ready to blunt that 
pair . not yet. 

They were sitting just as he’d left 
them. Tria was speaking: 

“. the highest probability and 
I have to go on that.” 

Gar merely nodded. 

Broey seated himself, nodded to 
Tria, who continued as though 
there’d been no hiatus. 

“Clearly, Jedrik’s a genius. And 
her Loyalty Index! That has to be 
false, contrived. And look at her 
decisions: one questionable decision 
in four years. One!” 

Gar moved a finger along the red 
line on the chart. It was a curiously 
sensuous gesture, as though he were 
stroking flesh. 

Broey gave him a verbal prod. 
“Yes, Gar, what is it?” 

“I was just wondering if Jedrik 
could be another. .” 

His glance darted ceilingward, 
back to the chart. They all under- 
stood his allusion to intruders from 
beyond the God Wall. 

Broey looked at Gar as though 
awakening from an interrupted 
thought. VV^at’d that fool Gar mean 
by raising such a question at this 
juncture? The required responses 
were so obvious. 

“I agree with Tria’s analysis,” 
Broey said. “As to your ques- 
tion. .” He gave a Human shrug. 
“Jedrik reveals some of the classic 
requirements, but. .” Again, that 
shrug. “This is still the world God 
gave us.” 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



Colored as they were by his years 
in the Sacred Congregation, Broey’s 
words took on an unctuous over- 
tone, but in this room the message 
was strictly secular. 

“The others have been such dis- 
appointments,” Gar said. “Espe- 
cially Havvy.” He moved the 
statuette to a more central position 
on the chart. 

“We failed because we were too 
eager,” Tria said, her voice snap- 
pish. “Poor timing.” 

Gar scratched his chin with his 
thumb. Tria sometimes disturbed 
him by that accusatory tone she 
took toward their failures. He said: 

“But ... if she turns out to be 
one of them and we haven’t allowed 
for it. .” 

“We’ll look through that gate 
when we come to it,” Broey said, 
“//"we come to it. Even another fail- 
ure could have its uses. The food 
factories will give us a substantial 
increase at the next harvest. That 
means we can postpone the more 
troublesome political decisions 
which have been bothering us.” 

Broey let this thought hang be- 
tween them while he set himself to 
identifying the lines of activity re- 
vealed by what had happened in this 
room today. 

Yes, the Humans betrayed unmis- 
takable signs that they behaved ac- 
cording to a secret plan. Things 
were going well, then: they’d at- 
tempt to supercede him soon 
. and fail. 

A door behind Tria opened. A fat 
Human female entered. Her body 
bulbed in green coveralls and her 
round face appeared to float in a 
halo of yellow hair. Her cheeks be- 
trayed the telltale lividity of dacon 



41 



addiction. She spoke subserviently 
to Gar. 

“You told me to interrupt if. 

“Yes, yes.” 

Gar waved to indicate she could 
speak freely. The gesture’s signifi- 
cance did not escape Broey. 
Another part of their set piece. 

“We’ve located Havvy but Jed- 
rik’s not with him.” 

Gar nodded, addressed Broey: 

“Whether Jedrik’s an agent or 
another puppet, this whole thing 
smells of something they have set in 
motion.” 

Once more, his gaze darted 
ceilingward. 

“I will act on that assumption,” 
Tria said. She pushed her chair 
back, arose. “I’m going into the 
Warrens.” 

Broey looked up at her. Again, 
he felt his talons twitch beneath 
their sheaths. He said: 

“Don’t interfere with them.” 

Gar forced his gaze away from 
the Gowachin while his mind raced. 
Often, the Gowachin were difficult 
to read, but Broey had been obvious 
just then: He was confident that he 
could locate Jedrik and he didn’t 
care who knew it. That could be 
very dangerous. 

Tria had seen it, too, of course, 
but she made no comment, merely 
turned and followed the fat woman 
out of the room. 

Gar arose like a folding ruler 
being opened to its limit. “I’d best 
be getting along. There are many 
matters requiring my personal atten- 
tion.” 

“We depend on you for a great 
deal,” Broey said. 

He was not yet ready to release 
Gar, however. Let Tria get well on 

42 



her way. Best to keep those two 
apart for a spell. He said: 

“Before you go. Gar. Several 
things still bother me. Why was 
Jedrik so precipitate? And why de- 
stroy her records? What was it that 
we were not supposed to see?’ ’ 
“Perhaps it was an attempt to 
confuse us,” Gar said, quoting 
Tria. “One thing’s sure: it wasn’t 
just an angry gesture.” 

“There must be a clue some- 
where,” Broey said. 

“Would you have us risk an in- 
terrogation of Havvy?” 

“Of course not!” 

Gar showed no sign that he rec- 
ognized Broey’s anger. He said: 
“Despite what you and Tria say, 

I don’t think we can afford another 
mistake at this time. Havvy 
was . well. .” 

“If you recall,” Broey said, 
“Havvy was not one of Tria’s mis- 
takes. She went along with us under 
protest. I wish now we’d listened to 
her.” He waved a hand idly in dis- 
missal. “Go see to your important 
affairs.” He watched Gar leave. 

Yes, on the basis of the Human’s 
behavior it was reasonable to as- 
sume he knew nothing as yet about 
this infiltrator Bahrank was bringing 
through the gates. Gar would’ve 
concealed such valuable informa- 
tion, would not have dared raise the 
issue of a God Wall intrusion. 
Or would he? Broey nodded to him- 
self. This must be handled with 
great delicacy. 

■k -k it 

We will now explore the particu- 
lar imprint which various 

GALAXY 



governments make upon the indi- 
vidual. First, he sure you recog- 
nize the primary governing force. 
For example, take a careful look 
at Human history. Humans have 
been known to submit to many 
constraints: to rule by Autarchs, 
by Plutarcbs, by the power seek- 
ers of the many Republics, by 
Oligarchs, by tyrant Majorities 
and Minorities, by the hidden 
persuasions of Polls, by profound 
instincts and shallow juvenilities. 
And always, the governing force 
as we wish you now to understand 
this concept was whatever the in- 
dividual believed bad control over 
his immediate survival. Survival 
sets the pattern of imprint. Dur- 
ing much of Human history (and 
the pattern is similar with most 
sentient species) Corporation pres- 
idents held more survival in their 
casual remarks than did the 
figurehead officials. We of the 
ConSentiency cannot forget this 
as we keep watch on the Mul- 
tiworld Corporations. We dare 
not even forget it of ourselves. 
Where you work for your own 
survival, this dominates your im- 
print, this dominates what you be- 
lieve. 

— Instruction Manual, 
Bureau of Sabotage 



Never do what your enemy wants 
you to do, McKie reminded him- 
self. 

In this moment, Aritch was the 
enemy, having placed the binding 
oath of Legum upon an agent of 
BuSab, having demanded informa- 
tion to which he had no right. The 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



old Gowachin’s behavior was con- 
sistent with the demands of his own 
legal system, but it immediately 
magnified the area of conflict by an 
enormous factor. 

McKie chose a minimal rcr__ 
sponse. 

“I’m here because Tandaloor is 
the heart of the Gowachin Federa- 
tion.” 

Aritch, who’d been sitting with 
his eyes closed to emphasize the 
formal Client-Legum relationship, 
opened his eyes to glare at McKie. 

“I remind you once that I am 
your client.” 

Signs indicating a dangerous new 
tension in the Wreave servant were 
increasing, but McKie was forced to 
concentrate his attention on Aritch. 

“You name yourself client. Very 
well. The client must answer truth- 
fully such questions as the Legum 
asks when the legal issues demand 
it.” 

Aritch continued to glare at 
McKie, latent fire in the yellow 
eyes. Now, the battle was truly 
joined. 

McKie sensed how fragile was 
the relationship upon which his sur- 
vival depended. The Gowachin, 
signatories to the great ConSen- 
tiency Pact binding the species of 
the known universe, were legally 
subject to certain BuSab intrusions. 
But Aritch had placed them on 
another footing. If the Gowachin 
Federation disagreed with McKie/ 
Agent, they could take him into the 
Courtarena as a Legum who had 
wronged a client. With the entire 
Gowachin Bar arrayed against him, 
McKie did not doubt which Legum 
would taste the knife. His one hope 
lay in avoiding immediate litigation. 



43 



That was, after all, the real basis of 
Gowachin Law. 

Moving a step closer to specifics, 
McKie said: 

“My Bureau has uncovered a 
matter of embarrassment to the 
Gowachin Federation.” 

Aritch blinked twice. 

“As we suspected.” 

McKie shook his head. They 
didn’t suspect, they knew. He 
counted on this: that the Gowachin 
understood why he’d answered their 
summons. If any Sentiency under 
the Pact could understand his posi- 
tion, it had to be the Gowachin. 
BuSab reflected Gowachin 
philosophy. Centuries had passed 
since the great convulsion out of 
which BuSab had originated, but 
the Consentient universe had never 
been allowed to forget that birth. It 
was taught to the young of every 
species. 

“Once, long ago, a tyrannical 
majority captured the government. 
They said they would make all in- 
dividuals equal. They meant they 
would not let any individual be bet- 
ter than another at doing anything. 
Excellence was to be suppressed or 
concealed. The tyrants made their 
government act with great speed ‘in 
the name of the people.’ They re- 
moved delays and red tape wherever 
found. There was little deliberation. 
Unaware that they acted out of an 
unconscious compulsion to prevent 
all change, the tyrants tried to en- 
force a grey sameness upon every 
population. 

“Thus the powerful governmental 
machine blundered along at increas- 
ingly reckless speed. It took com- 
merce and all the important ele- 
ments of society with it. Laws were 



thought of and passed within hours. 
Every society came to be twisted 
into a suicidal pattern. People be- 
came unprepared for those changes 
which the universe demanded. They 
were unable to change. 

“It was the time of brittle money, 
‘appropriated in the morning and 
gone by nightfall,’ as you learned 
earlier. In their passion for same- 
ness, the tyrants made themselves 
more and more powerful. All others 
grew correspondingly weaker and 
weaker. New bureaus and directo- 
rates, odd ministries, leaped into 
existence for the most improbable 
purposes. These became the citadels 
of a new aristocracy, rulers who 
kept the giant wheel of government 
careening along, spreading destruc- 
tion, violence and chaos wherever 
they touched. 

“In those desperate times, a 
handful of people (the Five Ears, 
their makeup and species never re- 
vealed) created the Sabotage Corps 
to slow that runaway wheel of 
government. The original corps was 
bloody, violent and cruel. Gradu- 
ally, the original efforts were re- 
placed by more subtle methods. The 
governmental wheel slowed, be- 
came more manageable. Delibera- 
tion returned. 

“Over the generations, that origi- 
nal Corps became a Bureau, the 
Bureau of Sabotage, with its present 
Ministerial powers, preferring diver- 
sion to violence but ready for vio- 
lence when the need arises.” 

They were words from McKie’s 
own teens, generators of a concept 
modified by his experiences in the 
Bureau. Now, he was aware that 
this directorate composed of all the 
known sentient species was headed 



GALAXY 



into its own entropic corridors. 
Someday, the Bureau would dis- 
solve or be dissolved, but the uni- 
verse still needed them. The old 
imprints remained, the old futile 
seeking after absolutes of sameness. 
It was the ancient conflict between 
what the individual saw as personal 
needs for immediate survival and 
what the totality required if any 
were to survive. And now it was 
the Gowachin versus the ConSen- 
tiency and Aritch was the champion 
of his people. 

McKie studied the High Magister 
carefully, sensitive to the unrelieved 
tensions in the Wreave attendant. 
Would there be violence in this 
room? It was a question which re- 
mained unanswered as McKie 
spoke. 

“You have observed that I am in 
a difficult position. I do not enjoy 
the embarrassment of revered 
teachers and friends, nor of their 
compatriots. Yet, evidence has been 
seen. .” 

He let his voice trail off. 
Gowachin disliked dangling implica- 
tions. 

Aritch’s claws slid from the 
sheaths of his webbed fingers. 

“Your client wishes to hear of 
this evidence.” 

Before speaking, McKie rested 
his hand on the latch of the box in 
his lap. 

“Many people from two species 
have disappeared. Two species: 
Gowachin and Human. Singly, 
these were small matters, but these 
disappearances have been going on 
for a long time — perhaps twelve or 
fifteen generations by the old 
Human reckoning. Taken together, 
these disappearances are massive. 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 




We’ve learned that there’s a planet 
called Dosadi where these people 
were taken. Such evidence as we 
have has been examined carefully. 
It all leads to the Gowachin Federa- 
tion.” 

Aritch’s fingers splayed, a sign of 
acute embarrassment. Whether as- 
sumed or real McKie could not tell. 

“Does your Bureau accuse the 
Gowachin?” 

“You know the function of my 
Bureau. We do not yet know the 
location of Dosadi, but we’ll find 
it.” 

Aritch remained silent. He knew 
BuSab had never given up on a 
problem. 

McKie raised the blue box. 

“Having thrust this upon me 
you’ve made me guardian of your 
fate, client. You’ve no rights to in- 
quire as to my methods. I will not 
follow old law.” 

Aritch nodded. 

“It was my argument that you’d 
react thus.” 

He raised his right hand. 

The rhythmic ‘death flexion’ 
swept over the Wreave and her 
fighting mandibles darted from her 
facial slit. 

At the first movement from her, 
McKie whipped open the blue box, 
snatched out book and knife. He 
spoke with a firmness his body did 
not feel: 

“If she makes the slightest move 
toward me, my blood will defile 
this book.” He placed the knife 
against his own wrist. “Does your 
Servant of the Box know the con- 
sequences? The history of the Run- 
ning Phylum would end. Another 
Phylum would be presumed to’ve 
accepted the Law from its Giver. 



The name of this Phylum’s last 
High Magister would be erased 
from living thought. Gowachin 
would eat their own eggs at the 
merest hint that they had Running 
Phylum blood in their veins.” 

Aritch remained frozen, right 
hand raised. Then: 

“McKie, you are revealed as a 
sneak. Only by spying on our most 
sacred rituals could you know 
this.” 

“Did you think me some fearful, 
pliable dolt, client? I am a true 
Legum. A Legum does not have to 
sneak to leam the Law. When you 
admitted me to your Bar you 
opened every door.” 

Slowly, muscles quivering, 
Aritch turned and spoke to the 
Wreave: 

“Ceylang?” 

She had difficulty speaking while 
her poison-tipped fighting mandibles 
remained extruded. 

“Your command?” 

“Observe this Human well. 
Study him. You will meet again.” 

“I obey.” 

“You may go, but remember my 
words.” 

“I remember.” 

McKie, knowing the death' dance 
could not remain incompleted, 
stopped her. 

“Ceylang!” 

Slowly, reluctantly, she looked at 
him. 

“Do observe me well, Ceylang. I 
am what you hope to be. And I 
warn you: unless you shed your 
Wreave skin you will never be a 
Legum.” He nodded in dismissal. 
“Now, you may go.” 

In a fluid swish of robes she 
obeyed, but her fighting mandibles 



46 



GALAXY 



remained out, their poison-tips glit- 
tering. Somewhere in her triad’s 
quarters, McKie knew there’d be a 
small feathered pet which would die 
presently with poison from its mis- 
tress burning through its veins. 
Then the death dance would be 
ended and she could retract her 
mandibles. But the hate would re- 
main. 

When the door had closed behind 
the red robe, McKie restored book 
and knife to the box, returned his 
attention to Aritch. Now, when 
McKie spoke, it was really Legum 
to Client without any sophistry and 
they both knew it. 

“What would tempt the High 
Magister of the renowned Running 
Phylum to bring down the Arch of 
Civilization?” 

McKie’s tone was conversational, 
between equals. 

Aritch had trouble adjusting to 
the new status. His thoughts were 
obvious. If McKie had witnessed a 
Cleansing Ritual McKie had to be 
accepted as a Gowachin. But 
McKie was not Gowachin. Yet he’d 
been accepted before the Gowachin 
Bar . and if he’d seen that most 
sacred ritual. 

Presently, Aritch spoke. 

“Where did you see the ritual?” 
“It was performed by the Phylum 
which sheltered me on Tandaloor.” 
“The Dry Heads?” 

“Yes.” 

“Did they know you witnessed?” 
“They invited me.” 

“How did you shed your skin?” 
“They scraped me raw and pre- 
served the scrapings.” 

Aritch took some time digesting 
this. The Dry Heads had played 
their own secret game of Gowachin 




politics and now the secret was out. 
He had to consider the implications. 
What had they hoped to gain? He 
said: 

“You wear no tatoo.” 

“I’ve never made-formal applica- 
tion for Dry Heads membership.” 
“Why?” 

“My primary allegiance is to 
BuSab.” 

“The Dry Heads know this?” 
“They encourage it.” 

“But what motivated them 
to. .” 

McKie smiled. 

Aritch glanced at a veiled alcove 
at the far end of the sanctum, back 
to McKie. A likeness to the Frog 
God? 

“It’d take more than that.” 

McKie shrugged. 

Aritch mus^ aloud: 

“The Dry Heads supported 

47 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 




Klodik in his crime when you. 

“Not crime.” 

“I stand corrected. You won 
Klodik’s freedom. And after your 
victory the Dry Heads invited you 
to the Cleansing Ritual.” 

“A Gowachin in BuSab cannot 
have divided allegiance.” 

“But a Legum serves only the 
Law!” 

“BuSab and Gowachin Law are 
not in conflict.” 

“So the Dry Heads would have 
us believe.” 

“Many Gowachin believe it.” 

“But Klodik’s case was not a 
true test.” 

Realization swept through McKie: 
Aritch regretted more than a lost 
bet. He’d put his money with his 
hopes. It was time then to redirect 
this conversation. 

“I am your Legum.” 

48 



Aritch spoke with resignation. 
“You are.” 

“Your Legum wishes to hear of 
the Dosadi problem.” 

“A thing is not a problem until it 
arouses sufficient concern.” Aritch 
glanced at the box in McKie’s lap. 
“We’re dealing with differences in 
values, changes in values.” 

McKie did not believe for an in- 
stant this was the tenor of 
Gowachin defense, but Aritch ’s 
words gave him pause. The 
Gowachin combined such an odd 
mixture of respect and disrespect for 
their Law and all government. At 
the root lay their unchanging rituals 
but above that everything remained 
as fluid as the seas in which they’d 
evolved. Constant fluidity was the 
purpose behind their rituals. You 
never entered any exchange with 
Gowachin on a surefooted basis. 
They did something different every 
time . religiously. It was their 
nature. All ground is temporary. 
Law is made to be changed. That 
was their catechism. To be a Legum 
is to learn where to place your feet. 

“The Dry Heads did something 
different,” McKie said. 

This plunged Aritch into gloom. 
His chest ventricles wheezed, indi- 
cating he’d speak from the stomach. 

“The people of the ConSentiency 
come in so many different forms: 
Wreaves (a flickering glance door- 
ward), Sobarips, Laclacs, Calebans, 
PanSpechi, Palenki, Chithers, Tap- 
risiots. Humans, we of the 
Gowachin ... so many. The un- 
knowns between us defy counting.” 
“As well count the drops of 
water in a sea.” 

Aritch grunted, then: 

“Some diseases cross the barriers 

GALAXY 



between species.” 

McKie stared at him. Was Dosadi 
a medical experiment station? Im- 
possible! There would be no reason 
for secrecy then. Secrecy defeated 
the efforts to study a common prob- 
lem and the Gowachin knew it. 

“You are not studying 
Gowachin-Human diseases.” 

“Some diseases attack the psyche 
and cannot be traced to any physical 
agent.” 

McKie absorbed this. Although 
Gowachin definitions were difficult 
to understand, they permitted no 
aberrant behaviour. Different be- 
havior, yes; aberrant behavior, no. 
You could challenge the law, not 
the ritual. They were compulsive in 
this regard. They slew the ritual de- 
viant out of hand. It required enor- 
mous restraint on their part to deal 
with another species. 

Aritch continued: 

“Terrifying psychological abra- 
sions occur when divergent species 
confront each other and are forced 
to adapt to new ways. We seek new 
knowledge in this arena of be- 
havior.” 

McKie nodded. 

One of his Dry Head teachers had 
said it: “No matter how painful, 
life must adapt or die.” 

It was a profound revelation 
about how Gowachin applied their 
insight to themselves. Law changed, 
but it changed on a foundation 
which could not be permitted the 
slightest change. “Else, how do we 
know where we are or where we 
have been?” But encounters with 
other species changed the founda- 
tion. Life adapted . willingly or 
by force. 

McKie spoke with care. 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



“Psychological experiments with 
people who’ve not given their in- 
formed consent are still ille- 
gal .. even among the Gowachin.” 

Aritch would not accept this ar- 
gument. 

“The ConSentiency in all of its 
parts has accumulated a long history 
of scientific studies into behavioral 
and biomedical questions where 
people are the final test site.” 

McKie said: 

“And the first issue when you 
propose such an experiment is: 
‘How great is the known risk to the 
subjects?’ ” 

“But, my dear Legum, informed 
consent implies that the experi- 
menter knows all the risks and can 
describe them to his test subjects. 1 
ask you: How can that be when the 
experiment goes beyond what you 
already know? How can you de- 
scribe risks which you cannot an- 
ticipate?’ ’ 

“You submit a proposal to many 
recognized experts in the field,” 
McKie said. “They weigh the 
proposed experiment against what- 
ever value the new knowledge is 
expected to uncover.” 

“Ahh, yes. We submit our pro- 
posal to fellow researchers, to people 
whose mission, whose very view of 
their own personal identity is con- 
trolled by the belief that they can 
improve the lot of all sentient be- 
ings. Tell me, Legum: Do review 
boards composed of such people re- 
ject many experimental proposals?” 

McKie saw the direction of the 
argument. He spoke with care. 

“They don’t reject many propos- 
als, that’s true. Still, you didn’t 
submit your Dosadi protocol to any 
outside review. Was that to keep it 



49 



secret from your own people or 
from others?’ ’ 

“We feared the fate of our pro- 
posal should it run the gantlet of 
other species.” 

“Did a Gowachin majority ap- 
prove your project?” 

“No. But we both know that hav- 
ing a majority set the experimental 
guidelines gives no guarantee 
against dangerous projects.” 

“Then Dosadi has proved dan- 
gerous?” 

Aritch remained silent for several 
deep breaths, then: 

“It has proved dangerous.” 

“To whom?” 

“Everyone.” 

It was an unexpected answer, ad- 
ding a new dimension to Aritch’s 
behavior. McKie decided to back up 
and test the revelation. 

“This Dosadi project was ap- 
proved by a minority among the 
Gowachin, a minority willing to ac- 
cept a dangerous risk-benefit?” 
“You have a way of putting 
these matters, McKie, which pre- 
supposes a particular kind of guilt.” 
“But a majority in the ConSen- 
tiency might agree with my descrip- 
tion?” 

“Should they ever learn of it.” 

“I see. Then, in accepting a 
dangerous risk, what were the fu- 
ture benefits you expected?” 

Aritch emitted a deep grunt. 
“Legum, I assure you that we 
^worked only with volunteers and 
they were limited to Humans and 
Gowachin.” 

“You evade my question.” 

“I merely defer an answer.” 
“Then tell me, did you explain to 
your volunteers that they had a 
choice, that they could say ‘no’? 

50 



Did you tell them they might be in 
danger?” 

“We did not try to frighten 
them . no.” 

“Was any one of you concerned 
about the free destiny of your volun- 
teersT' 

“Be careful how you judge us, 
McKie. There is a fundamental ten- 
sion between science and 
freedom — no matter how science is 
viewed by its practitioners nor how 
freedom is sensed by those who be- 
lieve they have it.” 

McKie was reminded of a cynical 
Gowachin aphorism: 'To believe 
that you are free is more important 
than being free. ’ He said: 

“Your volunteers were lured into 
this project.” 

“Some would see it that way.” 
McKie reflected on this. He still 
did not know precisely what the 
Gowachin had done on Dosadi, but 
he was beginning to suspect it’d be 
something repulsive. He could not 
keep this fear from his voice. 

“We return to the question of 
expected benefits.” 

“Legum, we have long admired 
your species. You gave us one of 
our most trusted maxims: 'No 
species is to be trusted farther than 
it is bound by its own interests.’ ” 
“That’s no longer sufficient jus- 
tification for. 

“We derive another rule from 
your maxim: It is wise to guide 
your actions in such a way that the 
interests of other species coincide 
with the interests of your species.” 
McKie stared at the High Magis- 
ter. Did this crafty old Gowachin 
seek a Human-Gowachin conspiracy 
to suppress evidence of what had 
been done on Dosadi? Would he 



GALAXY 



dare such a gambit? Just how bad 
was this Dosadi fiasco? 

To test the issue, McKie asked: 
“What benefits did you expect? I 
insist.” 

Aritch slumped. His chairdog ac- 
commodated to the new position. The 
High Magister favored McKie with 
a heavy-lidded stare for a long 
interval, then: 

“You play this game better than 
we’d ever hoped.” 

“With you. Law and Government 
are always a game. I come from 
another arena.” 

“Your Bureau.” 

“And I was trained as a 
Legum.” 

“Are you my Legum?” 

“The binding oath\ is binding on 
me. Have you no faith in. .” 
McKie broke off, overwhelmed 
by a sudden insight. Of course! The 
Gowachin had known for a long 
time that Dosadi would become a 
legal issue. 

“Faith in what?” Aritch asked. 
“Enough of these evasions!’’ 
McKie said. “You had your Dosadi 
problem in mind when you trained 
me. Now, you act as though you 
distrust your own plan.” 

Aritch’s lips rippled. 

“How strange. You’re more 
Gowachin than a Gowachin.” 
“What benefits did you expect 
when you took this risk?” 

Aritch’s fingers splayed, stretch- 
ing the webs. 

“We hoped for a quick conclu- 
sion and benefits to offset the natu- 
ral animosities we knew would 
arise. But it’s now more than 
twenty of your generations, not 
twelve or fifteen, that we’ve 
grasped the firebrand. Benefits? 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



Yes, there are some, but we dare 
not use them or free Dosadi from 
bondage lest we raise questions 
which we cannot answer without 
revealing our . source.” 

“The benefits!” McKie said. 
"Yout L egum insists.” 

Aritch exhaled a shuddering 
breath through his ventricles. 

“Only the Caleban who guards 
Dosadi knows its location and she is 
charged to give access without re- 
vealing that place. Dosadi is 
peopled by Humans and Gowachin. 
They live in a single city they call 
Chu. Some ninety million people 
live there, almost equally divided 
between the two species. Perhaps 
three times that number live outside 
Chu, but they’re outside the exper- 
iment. Chu is approximately eight 
hundred square kilometers.” 

The population density shocked 
McKie. Millions per kilometer. He 
had difficulty visualizing it. Even 
allowing for a city’s vertical dimen- 
sion . and burrowing. 
There’d be some, of course, whose 
power bought them space, but the 
others . Gods! Such a city would 
be crawling with people, no escap- 
ing the pressure of your fellows 
anywhere except on that unex- 
plained Rim. McKie said as much 
to Aritch. 

The High Magister confirmed 
this. 

“The population density is very 
great in some areas. The people of 
Dosadi call these areas ‘Warrens’ 
for good reason.” 

“But why? With an entire planet 
to live on. .” 

“Dosadi is poisonous to our 
forms of life. All of their food 
comes from carefully managed hy- 



51 



droponics factories in the heart of 
Chu. Food factories and the dis- 
tribution are managed by warlords. 
Everything is under a quasi-military 
form of management. But life ex- 
pectancy in the city is four times 
that outside.” 

“You said the population outside 
the city was much larger than. .” 

“They breed like mad animals.” 

“What possible benefits could 
you have expected- from. .” 

“Under pressure, life reveals its 
basic elements.” 

McKie considered what the High 
Magister had revealed. The picture 
of Dosadi was that of a seething 
mass. Warlords. He visualized 
walls, some people living and work- 
ing in comparative richness of space 
while others. Gods! It was mad- 
ness in a universe where some 
highly habitable planets held no 
more than a few thousand people. 
His voice brittle, McKie addressed 
himself to the High Magister. 

“These basic elements, the bene- 
fits you sought ... I wish to hear 
about them.” 

Aritch hitched himself forward. 

“We have discovered new ways 
of association, new devices of 
motivation, unsuspected drives 
which can impose themselves upon 
an entire population.” 

“I require specific and explicit 
enumeration of these discoveries.” 

“Presently, Legum . pre- 
sently.” 

Why did Aritch delay? Were the 
so-called benefits insignificant be- 
side this repulsive horror of such an 
experiment? McKie ventured 
another tack. 

“You say this planet is poison- 
ous. Why not remove the inhabit- 

52 



ants a few at a time, subject them 
to memory erasure if you must, and 
feed them out into the ConSentiency 
as new. .” 

^‘We dare not! First, the inhabit- 
ants have developed an immunity to 
erasure, a by-product of those 
poisons which do get into their diet. 
Second, given what they have be- 
come on Dosadi. How can I ex- 
plain this to you?” 

“Why don’t the people Just leave 
Dosadi? I presume you deny them 
Jumpdoors, but rockets and other 
mechanical. .” 

“We will not permit them to 
leave. Our Caleban encloses Dosadi 
in what she calls a ‘tempokinetic 
barrier’ which our test subjects can- 
not penetrate.” 

“Why?” 

“We will destroy the entire 
planet and everything on it rather 
than loose this population upon the 
ConSentiency.” 

“What are the people of Dosadi 
that you’d even contemplate such a 
thing?” 

Aritch shuddered. 

“We^have created a monster.”

As she hurried across the -roof of 
the adjoining parking spire at mid- 
afternoon of her final day as a 
Liaitor, Jedrik couldn’t clear her 
mind of the awareness that she was 
about to shed another mark of rank. 



GALAXY 



Stacked in the building beneath her, 
each one suspended by its roof 
grapples on the conveyor track, 
were the vehicles of the power mer- 
chants and their minions. The 
machines varied from the giant jai- 
gers, heavy with armor and 
weapons and redundant engine sys- 
tems, of the ruling few, down to the 
tiny black skitters assigned to such 
as hersQlf. Ex-minion Jedrik knew 
she was about to take a final ride in 
the machine which had released her 
from the morning and evening crush 
on the underground walkways. 

She had timed her departure with 
care. The ones who rode in the jai- 
gers would not yet have reassigned 
her skitter and its driver. That driv- 
•er, Havvy, required her special at- 
tention in this last ride, this narrow 
time slot which she had set aside 
for dealing with him. 

Jedrik sensed events rushing at 
their own terrible pace now. Just 
that morning she had loosed death 
against fifty Humans. Now, the av- 
alanche gathered power. 

The parking spire’s roof pave- 
ment had been poorly repaired after 
the recent explosive destruction of 
three Rim guerrillas. Her feet ad- 
justed to the rough paving as she 
hurried across the open area to the 
drop chute. At the chute, she 
paused and glanced westward 
through Chu’s enclosing cliffs. The 
sun, already nearing its late af- 
ternoon line on the cliffs, was a 
golden glow beyond the God Wall’s 
milky barrier. To her newly sen- 
sitized fears, this was not a sun but 
a malignant eye which peered down 
at her. 

By now, the rotofiles in her 
office would’ve been ignited by the 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



clumsy intrusion of the LP toads. 
There’d be a delay while they re- 
ported this, while it was bucked up 
through the hierarchy to a level 
where somebody dared make an 
important decision. 

Jedrik fought against letting her 
thoughts fall into trembling 
shadows. After the rotofiles, other 
data would accumulate. The Elec- 
tor’s people would grow increas- 
ingly suspicious. But that was part 
of her plan, a layer with many 
layers. 

Abruptly, she stepped into the 
chute, dropped to her parking level, 
stared across the catwalks at her 
skitter dangling among the others. 
Havvy sat on the sloping hood, his 
shoulders in their characteristic 
slouch. Good. He behaved as ex- 
pected. A certain finesse was called 
for now, but she expected no real 
trouble from anyone as shallow and 
transparent as Havvy. Still, she kept 
her right hand in the pocket where 
she’d secreted a small but adequate 
weapon. Nothing could be allowed 
to stop her now. She had selected 
and trained lieutenants, but none of 
them quite matched her capabilities. 
The military force which had been 
prepared for this moment needed 
Jedrik for that extra edge which 
could pluck victory from the days 
ahead of them. 

For now, I must float like a leaf 
above the hurricane. 

Havvy was reading a book, one 
of those pseudo-deep things he reg- 
ularly affected, a book which she 
knew he would not understand. As 
he read, he pulled at his lower lip 
with thumb and forefinger, the very 
picture of a deep intellectual in- 
volvement with important ideas. But 

5? 



it was only a picture. He gave no 
sign that he heard Jedrik hurrying 
toward him. A light breeze flicked 
the pages and he held them with 
one finger. She could not yet see 
the title, but assumed this book 
would be on the contraband list as 
was much of his reading. That was 
the peak of Havvy’s risk taking, not 
great but imbued with a certain false 
glamor. Another picture. 

She could see him quite distinctly 
now in readable detail. He should 
have looked up by now but still sat 
absorbed in his book. Havvy pos- 
sessed large brown eyes which he 
obviously believed he employed 
with deceptive innocence. The real 
innocence went far beyond his shal- 
low attempts at deception. Jedrik’s 
imagination easily played the scene 
should one of Broey’s people con- 
front Havvy in this pose. 

“A contraband book?” Havvy 
would ask, playing his brown eyes 
for all their worthless innocence. “/ 
didn’t think there were any more of 
those around. Thought you’d 
burned them all. Fellow handed it 
to me on the street when / asked 
what he was reading.” 

And the Elector’s spy would con- 
ceal a sneer while asking: ‘‘Didn’t 
you question such a gift?” 

Should it come to that, things 
would grow progressively stickier 
for Havvy along paths he could not 
anticipate. His innocent brown eyes 
would deceive one of the Elector’s 
people no more than they deceived 
her. In view of this, she read other 
messages in the fact that Havvy had 
produced her key to the God 
Wall — this Joij X. McKie. Havvy 
had come to her with his heavy- 
handed conspiratorial manner: 

54 



“The Rim wants to send in a 
new agent. We thought you 
might. .’’ 

And every datum he’d divulged 
about this oddity, every question 
he’d answered with his transparent 
candor, had increased her tension, 
surprisq. and elation. 

Jedrik thought upon these matters 
as she approached Havvy. 

He sensed her presence, looked 
up. Recognition and something 
unexpected — a watchfulness half- 
shielded — came over him. He 
closed his book. 

“You’re early.’’ 

“As I said I’d be.” 

This new manner in Havvy set 
her nerves on edge, raised old 
doubts. No course remained for her 
except attack. 

“Only toads don’t break 
routine,” she said. 

Havvy’s gaze darted left, right, 
returned to her face. He hadn’t ex- 
pected this. It was a bit more open 
risk than Havvy relished. The Elec- 
tor had spy devices everywhere. 
Havvy’s reaction told her what she 
wanted to know, however. She ges- 
tured to the skitter. 

“Let’s go.” 

“Yes ... of course.” 

He pocketed his book, slid down 
and opened her door. His actions 
were a bit too brisk. The button tab 
on one of his green striped sleeves 
caught on the door handle. He freed 
it with an embarrassed flurry. 

Jedrik slipped into the passenger 
harness. Havvy slammed the door a 
touch too hard. Nervous. Good. He 
took his place at the power bar to 
her left, kept his profile to her when 
he spoke. 




GALAXY 



“Head for the apartment.” 

A slight hesitation, then: 

“Very good.” 

He activated the grapple tracks. 
The skitter jerked into motion, 
danced sideways and slid smoothly 
down the diveway to the street. 

As they emerged from the en- 
closing shadows of the parking 
spire, even before the grapple re- 
leased them and Havvy activated 
the skitter’s own power, Jedrik 
firmed her decision not to look 
back. The Liaitor building had be- 
come part of her past, a pile of 
greygreen stones hemmed by other 
tall structures with, here and there, 
a gap to the cliffs and the river’s 
arms. That was part of her life 
which she now excised. Best it 
were done cleanly. Her mind must 
be clear for what came next. 

Havvy drove with his usual com- 
petence, not overly proficient but 
adequate. His knuckles, however, 
were white on the steering arms. He 
at least had enough good sense to 
fear her. Jedrik allowed the emotion 
to ferment in him while she studied 
the passing scene. There was little 
traffic and all of that armored. The 
occasional tube access with its sense 
of weapons and eyes behind the 
guard slits — all seemed normal 
enough. It was too soon for any hue 
and cry after an errant senior liaitor. 

They went through the first wal- 
led check point without a hitch. The 
guards were efficiently casual, a 
glance at the skitter and their iden- 
tification brassards. The danger with 
routines, she told herself, was that 
they became boring very soon. 

The streets became a shade wider 
and more open as they climbed on 
the normal ring route. 



Jedrik turned, studied Havvy, the 
way he appeared to concentrate on 
his driving with an air of stored-up 
concentration. Perhaps that was the 
key to Havvy. He knew his own de- 
ficiencies, knew it was not right for 
him to hold a driver’s job, even for 
the middle echelons, when the War- 
rens were jammed with others av- 
aricious for any step upward. Ob- 
viously, Havvy contained valuable 
secrets which he sold at a hidden 
market. She had to nudge that hid- 
den market now. It must appear 
faintly clumsy, as though the events 
of this day had disturbed her tim- 
ing. 

“Can we be overheard?” she 
asked. 

This made no difference to her 
plans, but it was part of the clumsi- 
ness. 

“I’ve disarmed the transceiver,” 
he said. “It’ll look like a simple 
breakdown.” 

To no one but you, she thought. 
But it was the kind of infantile re- 
sponse she’d grown accustomed to 
from Havvy. She picked up the 
gambit. 

“You expected that we’d require 
privacy?” 

He almost shot a startled look at 
her, caught himself, then: 

“Oh, no! It was a precaution. I 
have more information to sell you.” 

“But you gave me the informa- 
tion about McKie.” 

“That was to demonstrate my 
value.” 

Oh, Havvy! Why do you try? 

“You have unexpected qual- 
ities,” she said and marked that he 
did not even detect the first level of 
her irony. “What’s this information 
you wish to sell?” 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



55 



“It concerns this McKie.” 

“Indeed?” 

“What’s it worth to you?” 

“Am I your only market, 
Havvy?” ^ 

His shoulder muscles bunched as 
his grip grew even tighter on the 
steering arms. The tensions in his 
voice were remarkably easy to read. 

“Sold in the right place, my in- 
formation could guarantee maybe 
five years of easy living — no wor- 
ries about food or good housing or 
anything.” * 

“Why aren’t you selling it in 
such a place?” 

“I didn’t say I could sell it. 
There are buyers and then there are 
buyers:” 

“And then there are the ones 
who just take?” 

There was no need for him to an- 
swer and it was just as well. A bar- 
rier dropped in front of the skitter, 
forcing Havvy to a quick stop. For 
just an instant, fear gripped her and 
she felt her reflexes prevent any 
bodily betrayal of the emotion. 
Then she saw that it was a routine 
stop while repair supplies were 
trundled across the roadway ahead 
of them. 

Jedrik peered out the window on 
her right. The interminable repair 
and strengthening of the city’s for- 
tifications were going on at the next 
lower level. Memory told her this 
was the eighth layer of city protec- 
tion on the southwest. The noise of 
pounding rock hammers filled the 
street. Grey dust lay everywhere, 
clouds of it drifting. She smelled 
burnt flint and that bitter metallic 
undertone which you never quite 
escaped anywhere in Chu, the smell 
of the poison death which Dosadi 



ladled out to its inhabitants. She 
closed her mouth and took shallow 
breaths, noted absently that the 
labor crew was all Warren, all 
Human and about a third of them 
women. None of the women ap- 
peared older than fifteen. They al- 
ready had that hard alertness about 
the eyes which the Warren-born 
never lost. 

A young male strawboss went by 
trailing a male assistant, an older 
man with bent shoulders and 
straggly grey hair. The older man 
walked with slow deliberation and 
the young strawboss seemed impa- 
tient with him, waving the assistant 
to keep up. The important subtleties 
of the relationship thus revealed 
were entirely lost on Havvy, she 
noted. The strawboss, as he passed 
one of the female laborers, looked 
her up and down with interest. The 
worker noted his attention and 
exerted herself with the hammer. 
The strawboss said something to his 
assistant, who went over and spoke 
to the young female. She smiled 
and glanced at the strawboss, nod- 
ded. The strawboss and assistant 
walked on without looking back. 
The obvious arrangement for later 
assignation would have gone with- 
out Jedrik’s conscious notice except 
that the young female strongly re- 
sembled a woman she’d once 
known . dead now as were so 
many of her early companions. 

A bell began to ring and the bar- 
rier lifted. 

Havvy drove on, glancing once at 
the strawboss as they passed him. 
The glance was not returned, telling 
Jedrik that the strawboss had asses- 
sed the skitter’s occupants much 
earlier. 



56 



GALAXY 



Jedrik picked up the conversation 
with Havvy where they’d left it. 

“What makes you think you 
could get more from me than from 
someone else?” 

“Not more. It’s just that 
there’s less risk with you.” 

The truth was in his voice, that 
innocent instrument which told so 
much about Havvy. She shook her 
head. 

“You want me to take the risk of 
selling higher up?” 

After a long pause, Havvy said: 
“You know a safer way for me?” 
“I’d have to use you somewhere 
along the line for verification.” 

“But I’d be under your protection 
then.” 

“Why should I protect you when 
you’re no longer of value?” 

“What makes you think this is all 
the information I can get?” 

Jedrik allowed herself a sigh, 
wondered why she continued this 
empty game. 

“We might both run into a taker, 
Havvy.” 

Havvy didn’t respond. Surely, 
he’d considered this in his foolish 
game plan. 

They passed a squat brown build- 
ing on the left. Their street curved 
upward around the building and 
passed through a teeming square at 
the next higher level. Between two 
taller buildings on the right, she 
glimpsed a stretch of a river chan- 
nel, then it was more buildings 
which enclosed them like the cliffs 
of Chu, growing taller as the skitter 
climbed. 

As she’d known, Havvy couldn’t 
endure her silence. 

“What’re you going to do?” be 
asked.

“I’ll pay one year of such protec- 
tion as I can offer.” 

“But this is. .” 

“Take it or leave it.” 

He heard the finality but, being 
Havvy, couldn’t give up. It was his 
one redeeming feature. 

“Couldn’t we even discuss 
a. .” 

“We won’t discuss anything! If 
you won’t sell at my price, then 
perhaps I should become a taker.” 
“That’s not like you!” 

“How little you know. I can buy 
informants of your caliber far 
cheaper.” 

“You’re a hard person.” 

Out of compassion, she ventured 
a tiny lesson. “That’s how to sur- 
vive. But I think we should forget 
this now. Your information is prob- 
ably something I already know, or 
something useless.” 

“It’s worth a lot more than you 
offered.” 

“So you say, but I know you 
Havvy. You’re not one to take big 
risks. Little risks sometimes, big 
risks never. Your information 
couldn’t be of any great value to 
me.” 

“If you only knew.” 

“I’m no longer interested, 
Havvy.” 

“Oh, that’s great! You bargain 
with me and then pull out after 
I’ve. .” 

“I was not bargaining!” Wasn’t 
the fool capable of learning any- 
thing? 

“But you. .” 

“Havvy! Hear me with care. 
You’re a little tad who’s stumbled 
onto something you believe is im- 
portant. It’s actually nothing of 
great importance, but it’s big 

58 



enough to frighten you. You can’t 
think of a way t6 sell this informa- 
tion without putting your neck in 
peril. That’s why you came to me. 
You presume to have me act as 
your agent. You presume too 
much.” 

Anger closed his mind to any 
value in her words. 

“I take risks!” 

She didn’t even try to keep 
amusement from her voice. “Yes, 
Havvy, but never where you think. 
So here’s a risk for you right out in 
the open. Tell me your valuable in- 
formation. No strings. Let me 
judge. If I think it’s worth more 
than I’ve already offered I’ll pay 
more. If I already have this infor- 
mation or it’s otherwise useless, 
you get nothing.” 

“The advantage is all on your 
side!” 

“Where it belongs.” 

Jedrik studied Havvy’s shoulders, 
the set of his head, the rippling of 
muscles under stretched fabric as he 
drove. He was supposed to be pure 
Labor Pool and didn’t even know 
that silence was the guardian of the 
LP: Learning silence, you learn 
what to hear. The LP seldom volun- 
teered anything. And here was 
Havvy, so far from that and other 
LP traditions that he might never 
have experienced the Warren. Had 
never experienced it until he was 
too old to learn. Yet he talked of 
friends on the Rim, acted as though 
he had his own conspiratorial cell. 
He held a job fgr which he was 
barely competent. And everything 
he did revealed his belief that all of 
these things would not tell someone 
of Jedrik’s caliber the essential facts 
about him. 



GALAXY 



Unless his was a marvelously 
practiced act. 

She did not believe such a mar- 
vel, but there was a cautionary ele- 
ment in recognizing the remote pos- 
sibility. This and the obvious flaws 
in Havvy’s character had kept her 
from using him as a key to the God 
Wall. She could not tolerate even 
the remote possibility that the key 
would break. Better to die herself. 

They were passing the Elector’s 
headquarters now. She turned and 
glanced at the stone escarpment. 
Her thoughts were a thorn thicket. 
Every assumption she made about 
Havvy required a peculiar protective 
reflex. A non-Dosadi reflex. She 
noted workers streaming down the 
steps toward the tube entrance of 
the Elector’s building. Her problem 
with Havvy carried an odd similar- 
ity to the problem she knew Broey 
would encounter when it came to 
deciding about an ex-Liaitor named 
Keila Jedrik. She had studied 
Broey’s decisions with a concen- 
trated precision which had tested the 
limits of her abilities. Doing this, 
she had changed basic things about 
herself, had become oddly non- 
Dosadi. They would no longer find 
Keila Jedrik in the DemoPol. No 
more than they’d find Havvy or this 
McKie there. But if she could do 
this. 

Pedestrian traffic in this region of 
^ extreme caution had slowed Havvy 
to a crawl. More of the Elector’s 
workers were coming up from the 
Tube Gate One exit, a throng of 
them as though released on urgent 
business. She wondered if any of 
her fifty flowed in that throng. 

I must not allow my thoughts to 
waruler. 



To float like an aware leaf was 
one thing, but she dared not let her- 
self enter the hurricane ... not yet. 
She focused once more on the silent, 
angry Havvy. 

“Tell me, Havvy, did you ever 
kill a person?” 

His shoulders stiffened. 

“Why do you ask such a ques- 
tion?” 

She stared at his profile for an 
adequate time, obviously reflecting 
on this same question. 

“I presumed you’d answer. I un- 
derstand now that you will not an- 
swer. This is not the first time I’ve 
made that mistake.” 

Again, Havvy missed the lesson. 

“Do you ask many people that 
question?” 

“That doesn’t concern you 
now.” 

She concealed a profound sad- 
ness. 

Havvy hadn’t the wit to read 
even the most blatant of the surface 
indicators. He compounded the use- 
less. 

“You can’t justify such an intru- 
sion into my. .” 

“Be still, little man! Have you 
learned nothing? Death is often the 
only means of evoking an appro- 
priate answer.” 

Havvy saw this only as an utterly 
unscrupulous response as she’d 
known he would. When he shot a 
probing stare at her, she lifted an 
eyebrow in a cynical shrug. Havvy 
continued to divide his attention be- 
tween the street and her face, ap- 
prehensive, fearful. His driving de- 
generated, became actively danger- 
ous. 

“Watch what you’re doing, you 
fool!” 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT

He turned more of his attention to 
the street, presuming this the greater 
danger. 

TTie next time he glanced at her, 
she smiled, knowing Havvy would 
be unable to detect any lethal 
change in this gesture. He already 
wondered if she would attack, but 
guessed she wouldn’t do it while he 
was driving. He doubted, though, 
and his doubts made him even more 
transparent. 

Havvy was no marvel. One thing 
certain about him: he came from 
beyond the God Wall, from the 
lands of ‘X,’ from the place of 
McKie. Whether he worked for the 
Elector was immaterial. In fact, it 
grew increasingly doubtful that 
Broey would employ such a 
dangerous, a flawed tool. No pre- 
tense at foolhardy ignorance of 
Dosadi’s basic survival lessons 
could be this perfect. The pretender 
would not survive. Only the truly 
ignorant could have survived to 
Havvy ’s age, allowed to go on liv- 
ing as a curiosity, a possible source 
of interesting data . interesting 
data, not necessarily useful. 

Having left resolution of the 
Havvy Problem to the ultimate mo- 
ment, wringing every last bit of 
usefulness from him, she knew her 
course clearly. Whoever protected 
Havvy, her questions placed the 
precisely modulated pressure upon 
them and left her options open. 

“What is your valued informa- 
tion?” she asked. 

Sensing that he bought life with 
every response, Havvy pulled the 
skitter to the curb, stopped and 
stared at her. 

She waited. 

“McKie. .” He swallowed. 
60 \ 



“McKie comes from beyond the 
God Wall.” 

She allowed laughter to convulse 
her and it went deeper than she had 
anticipated. For an instant, she was 
helpless with it and this sobered 
her. Not even Havvy could be per- 
mitted such an advantage. 

Havvy was angry. 

“What’s so funny?” 

“You are. Did you imagine for 
a second that I wouldn’t recognize 
someone alien to Dosadi? Little man, 
how have you survived?’ ’ 

This time, he read her inference 
correctly. It threw him back on the 
only resource remaining, and it 
even answered her question. 

“Don’t underestimate my value.” 
Yes, of course — the uqknown 
value of X. And there was a latent 
threat in his tone which she’d nevef 
heard before. Could Havvy call 
upon protectors from beyond the 
God Wall? That did not seem pos- 
sible, given his circumstances, but 
it had to be considered. It would 
not do to approach her larger prob- 
lems from too narrow a viewpoint. 
People who could enclose an entire 
planet in an impenetrable barrier 
would have other capabilities. Some 
of these creatures came and went at 
will, as though Dosadi were merely 
a casual stopping point. And the 
travelers from X could change their 
bodies; that was the single terrible 
fact which must never be forgotten; 
that was what had led her ancestors 
to breed for a Keila Jedrik. 

Such considerations always left 
her feeling almost helpless, shaken 
by the ultimate unknowns which lay 
in her path. Was Havvy still 
Havvy? Her trusted senses an- 
swered: Yes. Havvy was a spy, a 

GALAXY 



diversion, an amusement. And he 
was something else which she could 
not fathom. It was maddening. She 
could read every nuance of his reac- 
tions, yet questions remained. How 
could you ever understand these 
creatures from beyond the Veil of 
Heaven? They were transparent to 
Dosadi eyes, but that transparency 
itself confused one. 

On the other hand, how could the 
people of X hope to understand 
(and thus anticipate) a Keila Jedrik? 
Every evidence of her senses told 
her that Havvy saw only the surface 
Jedrik which she wanted him to see. 
His spying eyes reported what she 
wanted them to report. But the 
enormous interests at stake here dic- 
tated a brand of caution beyond 
anything she’d ever before at- 
tempted. The fact that she saw this 
arena of explosive repercussions, 
however, armed her with grim satis- 
faction. The idea that a Dosadi 
puppet might rebel against X and 
fully understand the nature of such 
rebellion, surely that idea lay be- 
yond their capabilities. They were 
overconfident while she was filled 
with wariness. She saw no way of 
hiding her movements .from the 
people beyond the God Wall as she 
hid from her fellow Dosadis. X had 
ways of spying that no one com- 
pletely evaded. They would know 
about the two Keila Jedriks. She 
counted on only one thing: that they 
could not see heY deepest thoughts, 
that they’d read only that surface 
which she revealed to them. 

Jedrik maintained a steady gaze 
at Havvy while these considerations 
moved through her mind. Not by 
the slightest act did she betray what 
went on in her mind. That, after all. 



was Dosadi’s great gift to its sur- 
vivors. 

“Your information is valueless,” 
she said. 

“You already knew it!” 

What did he hope to catch with 
such a gambit? Not for the first 
time, she asked herself whether 
Havvy might represent the best that 
‘X’ could produce. Would they 
knowingly send their dolts here? It 
hardly seemed possible. But how 
could Havvy’s childish incompe- 
tence command such tools of power 
as the God Wall implied? Were the 
people of ‘X’ the decadent descen- 
dants of greater beings? 

Even though his own survival de- 
pended on it, Havvy would not re- 
main silent. 

“If you didn’t already know 
about McKie, then you . you 
don’t believe me!” 

This was too much. Even for 
Havvy it was too much and she told 
herself: Despite the unknown pow- 
ers of ‘X,’ he will have to die. He 
muddies the water. Such incompe- 
tence cannot be permitted to breed. 

It would have to be done without 
passion, not like a Gowachin male 
weeding his own tads but with a 
kind of clinical decisiveness which 
‘X’ could not misunderstand. 

For now, she had arranged that 
Havvy take her to a particular 
place. He still ha(^ a role to per- 
form. Later, with discrete attention 
to the necessary misdirections, she 
would do what had to be done. 
Then the next part of her plan could 
be assayed.

Came one day startling news: 
Barry N. Malzberg and Robert Sil- 
verberg are withdrawing, or have 
withdrawn, or will shortly withdraw 
from writing science fiction. 
Malzberg explains himself in the 
pages of F & SF; Silverberg stuns a 
symposium audience with the reve- 
lation. And, perhaps not amazingly, 
the reasons they give for their deci- 
sions are the same. 

They are giving up sf writing 
because nobody takes a serious sci- 
ence fiction writer seriously. Be- 
cause sf isn’t in the mainstream. 
It’s not even, God help it, in a 
major tributary. No, sf is derelect 
in some brackish backwater — 

62 



drifting helplessly between the 
rusted hull of Verne’s Nautilus and 
the body of Tom Swift’s Electric 
Sheep. 

It’s not really that science fiction 
is bankrupt. It’s Just that, dammit, 
the mainstream fiction boys are so 
serious, and what hurts is that ev- 
erybody knows it, everybody ap- 
preciates. Kurt Vonnegut spins 
yams of Tralfamadorians and Ice- 
Nine and the professors in literature 
departments add him to their read- 
ing lists. John Gardner tells the 
Beowulf story from Grendel’s point 
of view and graduate students mur- 
mur: “Dissertation fodder.” 

But if you’re Barry Malzberg or 

GALAXY 



Robert Silverberg or any one of 
hundreds of other sf writers whose 
stuff has appeared in the pages of 
science fiction pulps, then you’re 
not one of the Big Boys. And if 
you’re serious, if you’re an artist, 
you might as well pack up your af- 
terburners and get out. 

No. 

Absolutely no. Why? Because 
that BEM that so frightens all of us 
who love science fiction and fan- 
tasy, and anyone who ever dreamed 
of being an artist someday — that 
particular shambling, half-seen 
monster is a fraud. In short, the 
mainstream is a twentieth-century 
shibboleth created by the univer- 
sities, the critics, the Gertrude 
Stein-style gatherers of literary 
coteries and the promotional divi- 
sions of the publishing houses. It’s 
a mystic society with its own ar- 
cana, a secret handshake and a little 
gold lapel pin in the shape of 
Mount Parnassus. It’s a campus 
fraternity that says: “We’re in. And 
you, you poor sap, are out.” 

Back in 1850, in a little house in 
Pittsfield, Massachusetts, another 
poor sap was cranking out a super- 
natural sea story at breakneck 
speed. He’d made a deal with his 
publisher, and the publisher was set- 
ting the chapters of the novel into 
type as fast as the poor sap could 
spill ink onto paper. 

Herman Melville was under con- 
siderable pressure. “Come on, 
Herman,” his publisher would write 
to him, “you’ve got a deadline. 



The typesetter is way ahead of 
you.” Melville got flustered. He 
had written a character named Bul- 
kington into Moby Dick, but he ap- 
parently couldn’t remember just 
what he wanted to do with him. So 
in a chapter called “The Lee- 
Shore,” Melville simply washed 
Bulkington unceremoniously over- 
board. Out of sight, out of mind. 

Moby Dick appeared in 1851 and 
the critics responded favorably. 
They felt that it was one of the best 
sea stories they had ever read. They 
loved the lore of sailing that was 
told with such first-hand vividness. 
They pronounced the book the last 
word on cetology. If the American 
universities extant at the time had 
placed great emphasis on vertabrate 
zoology, Moby Dick might well 
have been adopted as required read- 
ing. 

But, unfortunately for Melville, 
there weren’t so very many univer- 
sities at the time. And none of 
them — none — had Professors of 
American Literature; the field sim- 
ply hadn’t been invented yet. So 
nobody much noticed the Platonic 
philosophy in Moby Dick. Nobody 
perceived the chiaroscuro imagery, 
the biblical allusions. Nobody re- 
alized that Melville had read just 
about every book ever written and 
had incorporated all that knowledge 
into his masterpiece. 

Nobody except his fans, 
Nathaniel Hawthorne to whom the 
book is dedicated and Walt Whit- 
man who saw fit to address Melvil- 



RAY GUN EVAPORATES AAAINSTREAM

le’s theories of man and the uni- 
verse in “Song of Myself.” 

Then around the turn of the cen- 
tury, a funny thing happened. 
Somebody got the bright idea that 
British critic Sydney Smith’s ques- 
tion “Who ever reads an American 
book?’’ might be sanctimonious 
tripe. Somebody got the idea that 
Americans might have something to 
say. By 1920, the critics had grab- 
bed harpoons. “After the White 
Whale!” they cried, almost as a 
single voice. And they’ve been 
chasing that wonderful, elusive, 
serene beast ever since. 

But the poor sap who had set the 
submarine leviathan in motion, who 
had loosed the raving Ahab, who 
wrote because he was delirious with 
cosmic truth, who endured the 
maelstroms of publisher and pov- 
erty, never lived to see the chase. 

But those days are all over now. 
We live in the enlightened 
twentieth century. We are percep- 
tive and wise. We have Professors 
of American Literature. Our critics 
are broad-minded. And great artists 
don’t starve. Old Melville never had 
these sages to fawn over him; he 
was never invited to be anybody’s 
writer in residence with a 
Guggenheim Fellowship and a fat 
stipend to pay the bills. 

And, friend, that’s what the 
mainstream Big Boys have today. 

Yet Americans have never been 
very good at taking the lessons of 
history. Yes, we say, there were a 
lot of sea story writers in the 



nineteenth century; and, yes, a 
couple of them turned out to be 
mainstream writers. But really, it’s 
just too, too much to suggest that 
we should pay any attention to the 
comical likes of Malzberg and Sil- 
verberg and the others who write 
those juvenile tales of golden ships 
that sail the seas of space! 1 mean, 
Moby Dick is one thing, but science 
fiction is quite another. 

1 don’t suppose that the obvious, 
simple-minded contradiction con- 
tained in that statement needs any 
more said about it. 

But there is another problem that 
sf writers have to contend with. 
Traditionally, there has only been 
one major plot line in the Great 
American Novel: Innocent young 
man encounters evil, falls from in- 
nocence and is crushed in the fall. 
If you want to understand American 
literature, you’ve got to understand 
that. Hawthorne wrote this novel, 
Melville wrote it, Henry James 
wrote it, Fitzgerald wrote it. And, 
by God, the mainstream novelists 
are still writing and revelling in it. 

Even this plot idea, this theme Of 
initiation, though, has run into some 
trouble. So the newest mainstream 
tactic is to deemphasize the plot line 
and to direct our attention to the 
process of writing itself. In effect, 
the mainstream boys now say: 
“Never mind what I’m doing. Just 
look at how I’m doing it!” 

This is all rather complicated. 
I’m afraid, but the point is simple. 
Ever since we’ve become aware — 



64 



GALAXY 



so painfully aware — of ourselves as 
literary artists, we’ve been scrutiniz- 
ing every move we make at our 
typewriters. We haven’t been rush- 
ing to our typewriters to bang out 
grand melodies. We’ve been agoniz- 
ing there with the brooding paranoia 
that Somebody Up There might 
think we’re pulp magazine hacks. 
We want so very much to be re- 
spectable, to be a part of What’s 
Going On. We want to be — 

Mainstream. 

We want to lisp along with Tru- 
man Capote on the Tonight Show. 
We want to hang around Elaine’s or 
The Algonquin in New York, those 
two great gathering places of liter- 
ary culture. We want to stroll over 
to Norman Mailer and say — actually 



to say — “Hello, Norman.” 

Well, I say to hell with Norman. 
And the universities that scorn sf. 
And the critics who condescend- 
ingly allow that sf may deal well 
with the impact of science on soci- 
ety and little else. I say write what 
makes you warm in the blood, what 
shakes you with sanity. I say write 
the truth. And I say don’t jump ship 
just to get into the mainstream. 

Because out here, among us, 
there may be a Nathaniel Haw- 
thorne or Walt Whitman who hears 
what serious science fiction and fan- 
tasy is saying. We believe. 

And there, among you writers of 
dreams and marvels, there may be a 
poor sap like that bearded har- 
pooner in Pittsfield. ★

there is no Way . 



I. 

Jerome looked down at death. 

It was no surprise. He had ex- 
pected it long before he topped the 
rise and gazed down into the small 
valley; he had seen the thin column 
of smoke that had slashed the dawn 
like an exclamation point, and had 
watched the lazy spiraling of the 
carrion lizards over the spot it 
marked. 

He recognized the signs. Death 
had come to his own family the 
same way. Once that same sentinel 
of smoke, those same patient, leath- 
ery wings, had hovered like a bea- 
con of doom over his childhood 
home, the farmstead at Waters 
Meeting. 

The Ronin had come screaming 
out of the night. They had raped 
and slaughtered his mother, tortured 
and murdered his father. His sister 
had died quickly, her brains splat- 
tered against the door frame as one 
of the raiders swung her round and 
round by her heels. He, a tiny, ter- 



rified boy huddling beneath a pile 
of sacks where his mother had 
thrust him as the Ronin broke down 
the cabin door, had watched the 
whole thing. 

He alone had survived. That was 
unusual. The Ronin were viciously 
thorough, seldom leaving anything 
alive, man or beast, on any 
farmstead they attacked. Yet some- 
how no one had bothered to check 
the pile of sacks beneath which he 
cowered. 

Later, when the Ronin had put 
the farmstead to the torch and had 
gone howling off into the night, he 
had managed to drag his parents’ 
mutilated bodies from the inferno. 
The roof and walls collapsed before 
he could pull out his sister. 

The next morning, the Fathers 
from the nearby Brotherhood had 
followed the thin column of smoke 
and the circling carrion lizards to 
where the young boy sat, crying, 
but calmly adjusting his mother’s 
clothing and shooing away the most 
insistent lizards. 

That had been fifteen years ago. 
But the world had not changed, and 
Jerome knew what to expect as he, 

his turn, followed the column of 
smoke and the circling lizards. 

He paused for a moment at the 
smash^, sagging gate of the pathet- 
ically inadequate stockade. The 
Ronin had simply shattered it, using 
a log as a battering ram. What had 
not burnt leaned at crazy angles, 
only waiting for time or a strong 
wind to send it tumbling. Down on 



THE WAY OF THE SWORD 



67 



the coastal plains, where Man had 
first settled after landing the great 
Arks on Kensho, Jerome knew that 
homesteads often possessed stout 
stockades, capable of withstanding 
all but the most determined assaults. 
But here, high up in a remote 
mountain valley on what was virtu- 
ally Kensho’s fender there was less 
time to be spared from grubbing a 
living from the stony land; you 
simply took your chances. This 
family’s luck had run out. 

For a moment longer he stood, 
calming his mind, steeling himself 
for what he knew awaited. Regulat- 
ing his breathing, he silently let the 
Litany of Passivity roll softly 
through his mind. “Moons, moons, 
shining down on waters, waters 
. .’’ As ready as he would ever 
be, he stepped through the gate and 
entered the smoking charnel house. • 

Still, what he found sickened 
him. There had been five in the 
family. The boy had been about 
nine. The two girls perhaps six and 
two. It was hard to tell; there was 
little left of them. The Ronin had 
literally hacked the bodies to pieces 
and the fire had disfigured what was 
left. 

He rummaged about the smolder- 
ing ruins, keeping a tight rein on 
the revulsion and anger he felt. It 
took all his training to contain him- 
self, to wrap his seething inner tur- 
moil in a calm exterior. But it was 
necessary. On Kensho, no man 
lived long if he could not control 
his emotions. That was why all men 



studied the Way of Passivity, why 
everyone practiced its spiritual exer- 
cises and physical disciplines. With 
a little training in its techniques a 
small group, even a family of five 
or six, might live in peace on a 
farmstead. With more training, 
larger groups, as many as sixty or 
seventy, might dwell in harmony in 
a Brodieihood. 

Yet even then the invisible 
Mushin hovered, ready in an instant 
to swoop down and feed should 
control falter. For the voracious 
mind leeches of Kensho fed on 
men’s emotions. Using some kind 
of feedback technique they ran 
emotions back through the victim’s 
own mind, making them stronger 
and stronger in an ever-increasing 
spiral, until the mind exploded into 
screaming Madness. Then, in a 
swirling horde, the Mushin fed, 
until all that was left was a drool- 
ing, gibbering husk. 

Jerome shook his head in denial. 
If any Mushin were still lurking 
about, they would get nothing from 
him. They had feasted enough last 
night! 

He rummaged about the smolder- 
ing mins, keeping tight rein on the 
revulsion and anger he felt. The 
Mushin had feasted enough last 
night. They would get nothing from 
him. Nothing! 

In a sod shed which had not 
burned, he found a shovel. On a 
grassy knoll north of the house he 
dug a shallow pit. Then he went 
back to the min, shooed away the 



68 



GALAXY 



carrion lizards, and, in some old 
sacks also discovered in the shed, 
he stuffed what he could find of the 
family. He didn’t bother to sort out 
the pieces. They wouldn’t care 
anyway: when one sack was full, he 
filled the other. Both were dragged 
to. the pit, thrown in, and covered 
with the crumbly grey soil the 
’steader had tilled in life. 

He paused for a moment over the 
freshly-filled grave. There should be 
something he could say, some fit- 
ting memorial for the massacred 
family. Some phrase that might 
exorcise the ghost of memory that 
arose on seeing in others the fate of 
his own family. 

His mind was blank. Faced with 
real, palpable death, he could only 
feel a dull grief for himself, his 
family, and these nameless, hapless 
’steaders. There was nothing he 
could say about the tragedy. It was 
too total, too awful, too ordinary. 

Yet as he stood there, the dull 
ache began to fade before a rising 
glow of rage. The Mushin, he 
thought. That’s where it all lies. 
The Mushin. The Ronin are nothing 
but tools, men who enjoy the blood- 
lust, the Madness, the intensified 
thrill of killing which the presence 
of the Mushin gives them. The 
Ronin live to kill, and the Mushin 
live off the blazing lust and searing 
emotions the Ronin feel as they kill. 
Get rid of the Mushin and the 
Ronin will quickly fade. 

Get rid of the Mushin. Until Man 
could escape the Mushin he was 



doomed to a miserable existence 
here on Kensho, huddling in con- 
stant terror on the farmsteads or hid- 
ing in fear behind the skirts of the 
alien Grandfathers in the Brother- 
hood. Until Man found a way to 
strike back at the invisible enemies 
that fed off his emotions and 
brought the Madness, he would 
stagnate, never growing nor expand- 
ing, never achieving his purpose 
here on Kensho, never fulfilling the 
idea behind the Great Pilgrimmage. 

Nothing I say over this grave will 
make any differnece, he realized. 
Nothing I say anywhere will make 
any difference. Only what I do can 
make a difference. 

Action. Action against the 
Mushin. That was the only hope. 
The Fathers, the Grandfathers, the 
whole Brotherhood; they were 
wrong. The Way of Passivity was 
not enough. Building passive de- 
fenses against the Mushin was not 
enough. There must be action, an 
active seeking out of ways to fight 
back. 

Action. If he succeeded in his 
quest, if the Way he sought did re- 
veal a way to fight back, then he 
would be raising a monument, a 
memorial to this family and to 
every family that had ever been 
slaughtered by the Ronin. He would 
be avenging every human ever 
driven to the Madness by the 
Mushin. 

Jerome turned from the grave. 
There was nothing to say. But there 
was a great deal to do. 



THE WAY OF THE SWORD 



69 



II. 



For the rest of the morning 
Jerome followed the tracks of the 
Ronin. At first he cursed the luck 
that had put them on the same route 
he planned on taking. Like him, 
they were heading up the slopes of 
the Mountain. 

At all costs, he wanted to avoid 
them. As near as he could tell, 
there were five or six in the band. 
That was an unusually large 
number. Two or three was more 
common. For Ronin were as 
dangerous to each other as they 
were to other men. When no easier 
prey was at hand, they would fall 
on the members of their own band, 
killing and destroying each other 
with the same fierce abandon they 
practiced on the ’steaders. In larger 
bands the tensions between the 
members were greater and so were 
the chances of mutual mayhem. No 
Ronin lived long, but at least those 
who ran in small packs had a better 
chance. 

In any case, there were at least 
five of them, all armed with 
swords. And there was only one of 
him, armed merely with the knife 
he had brought when he left the 
Brotherhood and a wooden staff he 
had cut at the edge of the Wood. 
Even if he’d had a sword, one Sixth 
Level Son, no matter how polished 
his technique, was no match for 
half a dozen Mushin-crazed Ronin. 

But what was the best way to 
avoid them? He could climb out of 

70 



the valley and cut across the ridges, 
hoping to find another valley up 
which he could travel. Or he might 
stick to the ridges, though the going 
would be rough. But in either case, 
he still might cross their path. As 
long as they remained above him on 
the slopes, there was no way he 
could be sure of avoiding them. 

He had finally decided that the 
wisest course was to stick with the 
known and follow the Ronin as long 
as they stayed in this valley. That 
way he would always know approx- 
imately where they were. But he’d 
have to travel cautiously to avoid 
closing with them from behind. 

As he moved up the valley, all 
senses alert for any sign of the Ro- 
nin, the forest closed in slowly 
from the ridges until it filled the 
valley from rim to rim. Soon his 
view of the Mountain, shining in 
the morning sun, was cut off. More 
important, his view ahead was cut 
down drastically. The woods were 
not thick, but all the same, he could 
barely see a few hundred feet ahead 
into the gloom and undergrowth. 
The blazes of sunlight that broke 
through the forest cover here and 
there only served to emphasize the 
shadows without improving the vis- 
ibility. 

When the sun had climbed to the 
highest point in the sky Jerome 
rested for a while. He drank from a 
small stream that gently splashed its 
way between the trees and ate the 
fruit of the ubiquitous and ever- 
bountiful Ko tree. The gentle 



GALAXY 



warmth of noontime, the quiet 
solemnity of the forest, soon lulled 
him into a half-dozing state. 

★ ★ ★ 

His body relaxed and calm, 
Jerome let his mind wander down 
the path of his past. It passed 
swiftly down the valley, touching a 
tone of grief as it sped by the smol- 
dering ashes of the raided farmstead 
with its fresh hilltop grave. Down, 
down it went, to the edge of the 
Wood. There it stood for a moment, 
gazing out over the Great Valley, as 
had Jerome himself less than a 
week before. The Brotherhood was 
in the distance. And beyond that, a 
mere smudge at the place called 
Waters Meeting, was the ruin of the 
farmstead where he had lived and 
his family had died. 

More slowly now, almost reluc- 
tantly, his memory trod the ground 
over which he had fled that night 
when leaving the Brotherhood. Into 
the Brotherhood it crept, back even 
to the practice yard where he had 
been sweating in the sun the day he 
received the summons to appear be- 
fore the Grandfather for Audience. 

With sorrow at the thought, he 
remembered how excited he had 
been, how full of hope for the fu- 
ture. He had been so sure the alien 
Grandfather would not deny his re- 
quest, so sure! Father Ribaud, the 
gentle old Swordmaster of the 
Brotherhood, had tried to warn him, 
tried to offer counsel. 



But Jerome had ignored him. Im- 
patient, filled with the importance 
and urgency of his vision, he had 
ignored all the warnings, even the 
fact .that the alien Grandfather had 
long ago forbidden any Brother to 
study the Way of the Sword with 
the Old Master on the Mountain. In 
his enthusiasm, he had chosen to re- 
ject the Grandfather’s edict that the 
sword was but a preliminary step on 
the True Way, that it was but a 
preparation for the Passivity. He 
had denied the experience of seven 
generations of men on Kensho, the 
wisdom of the Grandfathers, the 
alien beings who had saved his race 
from the Mushin and the Madness, 
the very teaching of the Way of 
Passivity to which man clung to for 
dear life. All, all he had refused to 
heed. No matter that the Way of the 
Sword was declared too active, no 
matter such activity threatened to at- 
tract the Mushin and bring down the 
Madness. He desired to follow the 
Way of the Sword. He knew, 
deeply, surely, that somewhere on 
that path lay the means of saving 
his race from the Mushin. 

And then, during the Audience, 
the Grandfather had done something 
to his mind, had tried to take it 
over. In a flash of terror, anger, and 
sudden intuition, Jerome had seen a 
link between the alien Grandfathers 
and the Mushin. A link between 
mankind’s benefactor and man- 
kind’s greatest enemy. 

The result had been an explosion 
of rage. In one, swift movement, he 



THE WAY OF THE SWORD 



71 



had stood and struck the Grand- 
father with his open hand. And had 
knocked its head off its body. 

Although the murder had gone 
undetected by the Fathers of the 
Brotherhood or by the Mushin, still 
Jerome had realized he could not 
remain; he must flee before discov- 
ered. He had decided to follow his 
original plan and seek out the Old 
Master on the slopes of the Moun- 
tain and study the Way of the 
Sword with him. 

Silently, with the light of Ken- 
sho’s moons to guide him, he had 
climbed the wall of the Brotherhood 
and become a Seeker of the Way. 

★ * ★ 

Suddenly he sat bolt upright, all 
drowsiness vanished in an instant. 
He strained to hear. Off in the dis- 
tance he could barely make out a 
high-pitched yelping. It was in- 
stantly joined by a chorus of other 
yowlings, mewings, bellowings, an 
unholy choir of animal sounds that 
could only come from the throats of 
crazed men. 

The Ronin! Somewhere up ahead 
of him the band had run across prey 
and was giving chase! 

Casting all caution to the winds, 
Jerome ran crashing through the 
forest in the direction of the howl- 
ing. Sometimes ’steaders built their 
cabins in the clearings that dotted 
the Wood. They tilled the rich soil 
to be found there. Perhaps the 
Ronin had found one such family 

72 



and even now were attacking. 

As he ran, dodging the major 
branches, accepting the constant 
swattings he took from the smaller 
ones, he calmed his mind. It was 
foolishness to run headlong into 
combat with six armed Ronin, but 
what could he do? His own experi- 
ence, his recent discovery of the 
family down the valley, his very 
sense of humanity, made it impos- 
sible to stand by and take no part 
while Mushin-crazed Ronin massa- 
cred another family. 

Abruptly the forest came to an 
end and Jerome all but tumbled out 
onto the soft turf carpeting a clear- 
ing. He pulled himself upright and 
came to a skidding halt. Like a 
solid wall, the combined presence 
of hundreds of Mushin struck his 
mind. The usual tingling that gave 
away their presence was a virtual 
burning. 

With frantic haste Jerome closed 
down his mind, asserting the controls 
taught him by the Fathers. He 
began chanting the Litany of 
Passivity to calm himself. “Moons, 
moons, shining down on waters, 
waters, moving slowly, moons mov- 
ing slowly, yet being still. Still the 
waters, still the moons. Movement, 
strife, all longing is but a reflection, 
passing to stillness when the mind 
is calmed.” 

Looking around he located the 
Ronin and their prey. The six were 
in a circle surrounding a lone man. 
The victim was dressed in a robe of 
coarse homespun. He was old, his 

GALAXY 



hair a shining white blaze in the 
light that poured into the clearing. 

Calmer now, Jerome began to 
notice other things. The old man 
had a sword, but it was still 
sheathed. He stood quietly in the 
middle of the circling Ronin, silent 
and unruffled. His head was bowed 
as though he were concentrating on 
a bug crawling in the grass at his 
feet. 

Jerome hesitated. The Ronin had 
not seen him. They were too intent 
on their prey. And there was no 
way they could have heard his 
crashing approach, because their 
own bowlings were so loud they 
drowned out any other sound. Nor 
did the Mushin sense his presence, 
so tight was his control. But what 
should he do? 

Before he had time to decide, the 
Ronin stopped circling and rushed 
in to attack their victim. The raider 
standing directly behind the old man 
was in the lead, hoping to make the 
kill from behind, his sword raised, 
flashing in the light, his mouth open 
in screaming anticipation of the 
slaughter. 

Without looking to right or left, 
the old man’s head snapped up and 
at the same instant he drew his 
weapon. But rather than moving 
forward, he stepped back and sim- 
ply slid the sword backward, impal- 
ing the charging attacker behind 
him. In and out the blade flicked, 
and the howling changed to a 
choked gurgle as the Ronin col- 
lapsed in a heap. As the prey had 

THE WAY OF THE SWORD 



drawn his sword, those attackers in 
front had checked their headlong as- 
sault, expecting him to come toward 
them. Now his sword swept around 
leftward from behind slicing 
through the ribs of the raider there, 
just below his upraised arms. The 
arc continued, flinging blood behind 
it, across the front, barely missing 
three madly backpeddling Ronin, 
and catching the one on the far right 
who had failed to move in time. 
Both his wrists were cut through, 
his sword, hands still holding it, 
sailed lazily through the air. Now 
the old man’s sword turned in mid- 
air, reversing its sweep, coming 
down and under, the tip almost 
touching the grass. The raider on 
the left, seeing the man on the right 
fall, had stepped in to strike. He 
met death as the blade swept under 
his guard, entering his body at the 
groin and leaving just under the 
sternum. The old man stepped back, 
pulling the flying sword with him, 
cutting edge upper-most. Stepping 
forward and to the left, he isolated 
the far right Ronin behind his com- 
panion, allowing him to deal with 
them one at a time. As the sword 
had flicked in, it flicked back out, 
catching the closest man in the 
throat. A quick step, a final thrust, 
and the last of the killers lay gur- 
gling out his life in the clearing. 

With a mighty sweep of his 
sword, a sweep which spatted blood 
and flesh in a centrifugal fountain 
of gore, the old man cleaned his 
blade. Then, with a deft movement. 



73 



he returned it to its scabbard and 
stood quietly gazing at the huddled 
bodies surrounding him. 

Utterly stunned, Jerome stood 
rooted to the spot, barely able to 
breathe. It had all lasted the merest 
second, the flicker of an eyelash. 
While Jerome had been trying to 
make up his mind, the old man had 
settled the issue completely and fi- 
nally. 

And what swordsmanship! Never 
in his fondest dreams had Jerome 
ever even imagined such a display. 
The sword had flown on its way, 
without pause, without uncertainty, 
without ever missing its mark! It 
was as though the blade itself had 
been alive, seeking and finding the 
vulnerable spots in its enemies’ de- 
fenses as surely as the Ko-bee finds 
the just-opening blossom, as lightly 
as a fluff-fly fluttering in a beam of 
moonlight. A sense of awe spread 
through Jerome. 

“You may approach. They are all 
dead.” The old man’s voice carried 
across the clearing the way Father 
Riband’s had in the practice yard at 
the Brotherhood. It was low, calm 
and strong, pitched Just right to be 
heard clearly and distinctly even at 
a distance. “Come. Even the 
Mushin have left to seek new prey. 
There is nothing here to feed on. I 
have no emotions and yours are 
under right control. The only thing 
this pile of carrion will draw now is 
a flock of lizards.” 

With a huge shake to loosen his 
taut muscles, Jerome moved softly 



across the clearing until he was 
standing next to the old man. The 
whole situation held a quality of 
dream to it, a sense of unreality, of 
things barely considered, half 
glimpsed in surprise. 

The swordsman sighed hugely. 
“Help me gather up their swords. It 
would be wasteful to let them rust 
away.” 

Still dazzled, Jerome bent to the 
task without question. A thought 
was slowly rising to consciousness. 
With it came a sense of excitement 
almost too intense to bear. He had 
been on his way up the Mountain to 
find the fabled Old Master and 
study the Way of the Sword. What 
he had just witnessed was without a 
doubt the most incredible display of 
swordsmanship ever seen. This old 
man dressed in homespun, bending 
down next to him to relieve the 
dead Ronin of their swords, this 
man must be the Old Master him- 
self! 

Jerome straightened, two 
sheathed swords in his hands. He 
held them out to the old man. The 
white-haired swordsman looked at 
him quizzically, his own hands full 
with the other four swords. “Am 1 
to grow two new hands to hold 
them all?’’ He laughed lightly. 
“Keep one yourself, for I see you 
go unarmed. A dangerous habit in a 
world where rabble like this,” he 
indicated a fallen raider with a san- 
daled foot, “wander about at will.” 

Trembling with the intensity of 
his excitement, Jerome tried to 



74 



GALAXY 



speak. “I . I . you must be 
the Old Master,” he blurted out. 

The man in the homespun robe 
cocked his head to one side, a mus- 
ing smile spreading across his fea- 
tures. “Master? I? You must be 
mistaken. I’m merely a hermit who 
lives far up the slope of the Moun- 
tain. No Master, I. Just a hermit.” 

Jerome stood, befuddled. 
“But . but . you must be the 
Master, the True Master Father 
Ribaud talked of. Surely you re- 
member him. He was one of those 
who came up from the Brotherhood 
many years ago to study the sword 
with you.” 

Laying down the four swords he 
held and taking the two Jerome 
offered, the old man shook his head 
in negation. “Ribaud? No. The 
name means nothing to me. Perhaps 
you refer to the hermit who lived in 
the hut before me. Perhaps he knew 
this Ribaud.” 

His confusion growing, Jerome 
blurted out, “But I’ve never seen or 
even dreamt of such swordsman- 
ship! Don’t you see? I’ve left the 
Brotherhood, come all this way to 
study the Way of the Sword with 
you. You must be the Master!” 

“1 don’t ‘must’ be anything,” the 
other replied sharply. “Least of all 
a True Master. Or even a plain 
Master. I’ve never studied the 
Sword nor any other way. Such 
nonsense is for the Brotherhood, not 
me.” He bent down and tied a cord 
around the six swords. “Now, if 
you’re not interested in one of these 



swords. I’ll be going back to the 
peace and quiet of my hut. I’ve bet- 
ter things to do than stand about 
chattering with a young fool.” With 
that, he hoisted the bundle of 
swords on his shoulder, and, step- 
ping over the corpses, headed for 
the woods at the edge of the clear- 
ing. 

For a few moments Jerome just 
stood there, too surprised to move. 
Then with a curse, he started after 
the old man, hurrying to catch up. 
This is the Master, he thought. 1 
know it. But Masters are notori- 
ously hard to deal with and this one 
has not had a student in many 
years. But I will not give up. This 
way lies my path. 

Up the Mountain the old man 
tramped, occasionally looking over 
his shoulder at Jerome and mutter- 
ing his irritation. Stolidly, re- 
lentlessly, silently, Jerome followed 
the Master. 

Only the dark of the forest kept 
him from seeing the glint of secret 
pleasure or the rare smile of satis- 
faction that lit up the old man’s 
eyes as he turned and saw the 
young man still behind him. 

III. 

The light was fading from the sky 
by the time they reached the Mas- 
ter’s hut. The old man went inside 
and rudely slammed the door in 
Jerome’s face. The young man 
sighed and sat down on the ground 
a few yards back from the door. He 



THE WAY OF THE SWORD 



75 



took the makeshift pack from his 
back and spread out his few belong- 
ings. From some stale Ken-cow 
cheese he had found at the ruined 
farmstead and some dried Ko-pods, 
he made his meal. As the sounds of 
night grew, so did Jerome’s weari- 
ness. It had been an exhausting day. 
His eyes heavy, he lay down on his 
spare robe and was soon fast asleep. 

★ * ★ 

He awoke to the sound of the 
Master clattering about in the hut. 
The sun was not yet up, but the 
largest of Kensho’s moons flooded 
the woodscape with its blue light. 
Jerome broke fast with the last of 
his cheese and Ko-pods and then 
went to the little stream that trilled 
its way downhill nearby. He 
splashed water over his face. The 
clear cold of it woke him 
thoroughly. 

Now what to do? He decided it 
would be useless to approach the 
Master again, demanding to be al- 
lowed to study with him. He would 
simply have to play a waiting game, 
staying around, doing things, until 
the Master came to accept him by 
the mere fact of his very presence. 
It would take time. But time was 
about the only asset Jerome had. 

When the Master finally came 
from his hut, stretching and yawn- 
ing, wearing the same homespun 
robe as yesterday, he ignored the 
young man sitting patiently a few 
yards away. As the old man mum- 

76 



bled about the edge of the clearing, 
looking for small twigs to start a 
fire, Jerome let the Litany of 
Passivity wash through his mind, 
clearing and calming it, schooling 
him to patience, to acceptance. 

After the Master re-entered his 
hut and shut the door with a bang, 
the young man rose and went into 
the woods. For a while all was si- 
lent in the little clearing, but for the 
buzzing of the Ko-bees and the occa- 
sional cry of a tree lizard. Eventu- 
ally a huffing and crackling of 
something . coming through the 
woods shattered the peace. The next 
instant, Jerome appeared, almost 
invisible beneath a pile of dry wood 
he had gathered. He staggered 
across the clearing to the hut and 
dumped the pile next to the door. 
Then he returned to his place and 
resumed his meditation. 

The sun rose higher and spilled a 
sideways glance into the small 
clearing on the slope of the Moun- 
tain. The Master emerged from the 
hut once more and shuffled off 
across the open space and into the 
forest. Jerome rose and followed on 
soundless feet, more the Master’s 
shadow than his companion. A 
short walk through the woods 
brought them to another clearing 
where the Master tended his garden. 
Silently, the two of them bent over 
the rows, weeding and tending the 
plants. The sun beat down equally 
on their heads, bringing sweat to 
both brows. Noon came and the old 
man left the clearing and the gar- 



GALAXY 



den. He walked into the woods to 
where the stream wandered about. 
After drinking he gathered a few 
handfuls of berries and wild fruit 
pods, then squatted by the side of 
the stream, munching his frugal 
fare, watching the young man who 
copied his every move. 

Finishing his meal, the Master 
rose and began stalking deter- 
minedly through the woods as 
though on his way to an important 
appointment. Behind him, Jerome 
scurried to keep up. Eventually the 
striding old man and the scurrying 
young one came to a place in the 
forest where nothing grew but a 
huge Ko tree. Jerome craned his 
neck and tilted back his head. The 
top of the tree was lost amid the 
confusion of its own branches. At 
its base, the trunk was easily forty 
feet around. 

Close to the base, in the deep 
shade of the branches, the Master 
took his seat, facing outwards. He 
crossed his legs, adjusted his hands, 
regulated his breathing and went 
into the meditation state known as 
“not-here-not-there.” Seating him- 
self about two yards in front of the 
Master, facing inwards, Jerome 
adopted a similar posture and went 
into the meditation state known as 
“waiting-with-awareness. ” 

For hours the two were still while 
the forest went about its life. 

As the sun’s rays reddened with 
the coming of evening, the old man 
arose silently from his position and 
walked back to the garden. Trailed 

THE WAY OF THE SWORD 



by Jerome, he picked a few vegeta- 
bles and returned to the hut. Again 
he slammed the door, denying the 
young man access. Jerome made a 
cold meal of the vegetables he had 
harvested, washed it down with 
even colder water from the stream. 

Eventually, since the Master did 
not venture forth again from the 
hut, Jerome lay down and went to 
sleep. 

In this way many days passed 
softly, hardly leaving any trace be- 
hind them, so similar were they all. 

★ * * 

Suddenly one morning everything 
changed forever. 

Jerome awoke knowing that 
someone was standing over him. He 
opened his eyes the barest slit, 
keeping his body relaxed and ready. 
Feet. With ragged old sandals. 
Knotted, tough calves. The hem 
line of a homespun robe. 

It was the Master. Jerome opened 
his eyes fully and sat up. 

The Master squatted, peering into 
his eyes, his face only a few inches 
from Jerome’s. 

“Who are you?” Abrupt. Harsh. 

“Jerome.” 

“What are you?” 

“A Seeker.” 

“What do you seek?” 

“The Way of the Sword.” 

“Why?” 

The question reverberated through 
Jerome’s entire being. Why, why, 
why, why, why, why ? Be- 



77 



cause the Sword had shattered his 
life. Because the Sword had mur- 
dered his parents. Because the 
Sword had shaped his life in the 
Brotherhood. Because the Sword 
had led him up this Mountain to 
this very spot. Because the Sword 
might be the key to setting his race 
free from the Mushin. Because the 
Sword represented Death and Life 
and Despair and Hope. Because the 
Sword. why, why, why, why, 

why ? Why? A million “Be- 

causes.” 

And yet, and yet . Why? Was 
there any answer to that question? 
Were “becauses” answers? Why? 
Was he here to save his race? Who 
or what had appointed him Savior? 
Was he here to avenge his parents? 
Was there any way to achieve that 
revenge? Why? 

The Master stared hard at the lad, 
his eyes burning deep, deep into the 
mists of confusion so thinly dis- 
guised in Jerome’s own eyes. Why? 
The Master waited. Jerome must 
answer, something, anything. 

And Jerome knew the answer was 
crucial. He knew his whole future 
hung on it. He knew the Master 
would accept or reject him on the 
basis of it. 

He also knew he had no answer. 

“I don’t know.” 

With a grunt, the Master rose and 
stood looking down at him. “Well, 
at least you’re honest. You don’t 
know the reason why you want to 
study the Way. Or rather, you know 
too many reasons. Your mind is 



like a flock of birds, each bird a rea- 
son, each seeking to roost on a 
single limb. As soon as one settles, 
another lands and jostles the first 
off the limb.” 

Confused, Jerome blurted, “What 
must I do? Must I allow only one 
bird to land? Must I get rid of the 
others?” 

“Rid yourself of all the birds. 
And the limb.” 

The young man stared blankly at 
the old one. Finally the Master 
sighed, “Enough of birds. There 
are no birds. 

“So. The long and short of it is 
you wish to study the Way of the 
Sword. For whatever reasons. 

‘ ‘There is danger here. Many are 
the paths one may follow on the 
Way. Some are broad and gentle. 
Others follow the high, rocky 
places. Great chasms yawn on all 
sides. And one slip plummets the 
seeker into the depths of the Mad- 
ness. 

“For on all paths, on the Way, 
the Mushin lurk. They are always 
ready to seize on any emotion not 
hidden, to reinforce it, to feed it 
back into the mind, thus starting a 
spiralling growth that drives the 
mind to raving Madness. Then as 
the mind dies, they feast. 

“This,” the old man continued, 
as if reciting a litany, “is what they 
did to us when first we arrived here 
on Kensho. We were unprepared for 
them. Our surveys of the planet 
showed no evidence of their ex- 
istence, no sign of higher life, no 



78 



GALAXY 



mark of civilization, nothing but 
primeval wilderness. So satisfying 
was the very vision of it hanging 
there in space, that Admiral 
Nakamura named it “Kensho” after 
the first stage of Enlightenment. 

“Then the Arks landed at First 
Touch, far off down the Mountain, 
down the Valley, across the Plain, 
by the Sea, and everyone went 
mad, tearing at each other, murder- 
ing, maiming. Like vicious, wild 
animals. It was the Madness. It 
blew the Colony apart and scat- 
tered the raving, killing, human de- 
bris across the landscape.” 

The Master looked down at the 
young man. “1 know you’ve heard 
all this. But you must hear it again. 
You must know what you risk. For 
you risk what they risked. The 
Madness. True, you have defenses 
they did not. You have the Passivi- 
ty, the disciplines and excercises the 
alien Grandfathers taught our race 
to preserve us from the Mushin. 
And by now, you may even have 
some sort of natural defenses, de- 
veloped by the force of natural 
selection and the terrific pressures 
of the last seven generations. But 
still, the risk is real.” 

Jerome swallowed hard. “1 know, 
this. Still I would be a Seeker of 
the Way even if the Madness were 
inevitable. I can do no else.” 

For a moment the old man stood 
there gazing down at the young 
cne, sadness filling every wrinkle 
on his weatherbeaten face. Then the 
sadness melted and sterness re- 



placed it. “Very well,'” he said 
brusquely. “Come with me.” He 
turned on his heel and stalked to the 
hut. 

The young man followed, 'rtie 
hut consisted of three small rooms. 
One, barely more than a large 
closet, was without a door. It held 
at least a hundred sheathed swords, 
scattered and piled about in no ap- 
parent order. On top of the pile, 
Jerome noticed the six swords the 
Master had collected from the 
Ronin he had slain down the valley. 
The second room, likewise door- 
less, contained a rough pallet and a 
grimy blanket. The final room, 
larger than the other two, held a 
crude fireplace hung with cooking 
utensils, several bins for storing 
vegetables, assorted cushions, and 
the Master’s sword, hanging on the 
wall opposite the hearth. 

From a comer, the Master took a 
handmade broom and held it out to 
Jerome. “Sweep the hut. Then pre- 
pare us breakfast.” 

IV. 

Once again the days followed the 
sun over the horizon like identical 
beads on a string. There was no 
sense in counting them, no logic to 
keeping track. To number each 
would have been to differentiate it 
from all others, to name this the 
Day the Tree Lizards Sang, and that 
the Day They Didn’t, one the Day 
that Brought Rain, another the Day 
the Sun Shone. But it was useless. 



THE WAY OF THE SWORD 



79 



for even the differences repeated 
themselves, and even the similarites 
changed. It was a rhythm that 
needed nothing to complete or com- 
plement it. 

Jerome’s life was the same. He 
swept the hut, gathered firewood, 
carried water, tended the garden, 
cooked the meals, meditated, and 
then began the round again. Soon it 
became impossible, or at least un- 
necessary, to determine which was 
the first act and which the last. As 
long as one followed the other, 
order was preserved. 

At first, Jerome was perfectly hap- 
py. To be in the Master’s presence 
was enough. But as the days passed 
through weeks and into months, 
he became fretful. When was the 
Master going to teach him the Way 
of the Sword? Never once did the 
old man so much as touch the 
sword that hung on the hut’s wall. 
Never did he even look in the smal- 
ler room filled with conquered 
swords. And his conversation was 
solely on matters domestic or per- 
sonal. 

Jerome’s unease grew into dis- 
satisfaction. He began to drop hints. 
He took some of the swords out of 
the small room and cleaned them 
until their blades shone. He made a 
wooden bokken and went through 
the motions of the practice forms, 
the katas, he had studied with 
Father Ribaud at the Brotherhood. 

The Master ignored him. 

Jerome’s dissatisfaction grew into 
anger. He commandeered a real 

80 



sword from the storeroom and prac- 
ticed his cuts on the air. He drilled 
his draws and repeated his katas 
with the naked blade. 

The Master merely complained 
that the garden was not adequately 
weeded. 

Anger fed on itself and became a 
barely concealed rage. The young 
man took to walking through the 
woods with his sword, slashing at 
small saplings and branches to test 
the trueness of his cut: it was rag- 
ged; his blade waffled, and the 
edges were not clean. 

The Master could not help but 
notice such wanton destructiveness. 
Yet his only comment was to re- 
mark that if Jerome wished to cut 
green wood to smoke meat, an axe 
would be more appropriate. 

The day came when Jerome knew 
he could contain himself no longer. 
He fought for control all morning, 
all through the weeding, all through 
meditation. When evening finally 
came he was beside himself. He de- 
cided to confront the Master. 

By the time they had finished din- 
ner, Jerome had inflamed his cour- 
age by stoking it with his anger. 
Abruptly, with no preamble (other 
than weeks of nervous fidgeting) he 
launched into his complaint. “Mas- 
ter. Why have you not taught me 
the Way?’’ 

The Master looked up, mock sur- 
prise written across his face. “Not 
taught you? I? How is that so? 
Have I not let you sweep the hut, 
fix the meals? Have you not weeded

the garden, carried water, collected 
firewood?’’ 

“But . but . You never 
show me any techniques, never drill 
me in my kata. You never teach me 
any advanced techniques or new 
kata. You never even speak of the 
Sword and the Way!” 

“Techniques? Katas? Words? 
What have such things to do with 
the Way? The sword is not the 
Way. It is but a way to the Way. 

“Why do you seek so far off for 
the Way? Do you think to find it 
like some rare mountain flower, 
hidden in a cleft in some isolated 
crag? The Way is here. It is in the 
I broom, the firewood, the vegeta- 
bles. It is in eating when you are 
hungry, sleeping when you are 
tired.” 

“But the Sword! I am not learn- 
ing the Sword! How can there be a 
Way of the Sword without the 
Sword?” 

“The Sword is the least impor- 
tant part of the Way of the Sword. 
He who has truly learned the Way 
of the Sword does not even carry a 
Sword. But I see what the problem 
is. You wish to become a 
Swordsman, and you confuse this 
with the Way of the Sword.” 

“How can they be different?” 

“When the sun shines in the sky, 
you cannot grasp it. When the 
moon reflects in a pool, you cannot 
grasp it. Are they both then the 
same?” 

The young man looked puzzled. 
“I don’t understand.” 



The Master chuckled. “That I am 
aware of. Seeker. You do not un- 
derstand. 

“Very well, then. Seeker. You 
wish to be trained as a Swordsman. 
It is not the Way. But all in all, it 
is as much a way to the Way as 
sweeping the hut. It is a harder 
way, with much greater danger. It 
is a longer way, too. But, very 
well, if that is your wish, so be it. I 
will begin training you as a 
Swordsman tomorrow. You will 
have all you wish, training, exer- 
cises, words. May you live through 
it.” The old man yawned, 
stretched, and then ambled off to 
his room. In a moment, he was 
blissfully sleeping. 

Hours later, the excited Seeker 
finally managed to follow his 
example. 

* * * 

The next morning, Jerome fixed 
breakfast as usual and then went out 
into the dew-wet woods to gather 
firewood and pick a few berries and 
Ko-pods. As he wandered about, 
his excitement began to grow. The 
Master had promised! He had prom- 
ised to train him! He wondered 
what new forms he would learn, 
what wondrous techniques he would 
master. Perhaps someday the Master 
would even teach him the 
techniques he had used against the 
six Ronin! How hard he would 
study! He would spend hour after 
hour perfecting every cut and 



THE WAY OF THE SWORD

stroke! The Master would be proud 
of him, just as Father Ribaud had 
been proud. 

Without warning he felt a tre- 
mendous blow, a shattering pain, 
between his shoulder blades. He 
was thrown to the ground by its 
force, the wood and berries flying 
in all directions. Even though sur- 
prised, he remembered to roll as he 
hit, ready to spring to his feet and 
confront his attacker. Before he 
could even complete his roll another 
blow caught him on the side of the 
head. Dizzy, he tried to rise, hold- 
ing his hands above his head to pro- 
tect himself. A stunning slam dou- 
bled him over. With hands raised, 
his stomach was wide open. 

The blows rained down. Jerome 
rolled and scrabbled this way and 
that, trying to avoid them. His head 
spinning, his eyes filled with tears 
of pain, he tried to rise and face his 
tormenter. But there was never a 
moment’s let up, never a chance to 
even call out to the Master for help, 
much less time to stand and run or 
fight. 

All his training was to no avail. 
He tried to block the blows, but 
wherever he moved his hands, the 
attacker struck the place they had 
just left. With a terrible surge of ef- 
fort, he managed to come to his 
knees, then staggered to his feet. 
Turning toward the blows, he faced 
his attacker. Ignoring the battering 
his ribs took, he raised his hands to 
shield his head, to wipe one eye 
clear, to see. 



The Master struck him on the 
shoulder so strongly that he col- 
lapsed back to his knees. Then the 
Master lashed out again at his head 
and flattened him. 

The Master! 

The shock of that made the bat- 
tering his body was taking seem 
mild by comparison. It was a shock 
to the seemingly invulnerable con- 
trols he had built over a lifetime. 
He felt the walls that kept his emo- 
tions in and the Mushin out weaken- 
ing, crumbling. Fear, stark terror, 
battered at them from inside as 
strongly as the Master smashed 
from outside. The Master! 

It was beyond logic, beyond un- 
derstanding. The Master had prom- 
ised to train him. And now the 
Master was beating him to death. 
Why? Why? 

Exhausted, sobbing with pain, 
humiliation, grief, anger, horror, he 
felt the ultimate terror. He felt the 
tingling presence of Mushin rushing 
to investigate this source of emo- 
tions, this feast of fear. And he 
knew he was defenseless. Defense- 
less against the Mushin! Defenseless 
against the Madness! With a thin 
whimper of futility, he tried to hold 
in his emotions. But it was no 
good, it wouldn’t work, his control 
was gone, smashed by the Master’s 
club. As his anguish swept up in a 
cresting wave, the Mushin and the 
Master’s club swept downward. 

He didn’t know which arrived 
first. For there was a roaring flash 
and total blackness.

GALAXY 




★ ★ ★ 

To his utter surprise, he awoke. 
For a few moments, he lay there, 
wondering at it, gently testing his 
mind to search for signs of the 
Mushin. Nothing. 

He tried to move. Pain smashed 
into him from every direction. 
There wasn’t anything that didn’t 
hurt. He sat up and the world began 
to flow in different directions at the 
same time. He waited, and eventu- 
ally the whirling and swooping 
stopped and the world settled into 
its accustomed orbit. Holding his 
throbbing head, he peered about. 
The Master was gone. There was 
calm in the woods. 

He checked his body. Nothing 
seemed to be broken, though a rib 
or two might be cracked and he was 
a mass of bruises. He stood. While 
he waited for the world to stabilize 
again, he once more searched for 
Mushin. 

He checked his mind. The walls 
of control were still there. They 
hadn’t been destroyed any more 
than his body had been. But they 
ached, too. 

Gods! What a beating! Worse 
than any he had ever suffered at the 
hands of the older Sons in his early 
years at the Brotherhood. He felt a 
mixture of anger and humiliation 
rising, bitter at the back of his 
throat. The Master had done this. 
Why? Did the old man hate him so? 
What had he done to deserve such 
treatment? He had gathered 



firewood, cooked the old man s 
vegetables, weeded the garden, 
hauled water, swept, done every- 
thing. Why had the Master treated 
him this way? 

The old man must hate him. That 
could be the only reason. The Mas- 
ter had never had any intention of 
teaching Jerome the Way of the 
Sword. He had only wanted a ser- 
vant. Jerome’s insistence that he be 
trained had undoubtedly angered the 
old man. Now he was trying to 
drive Jerome away. 

Calmer now, the young man 
thought it through. The Master 
hated him, hated him badly enough 
to beat him senseless and nearly kill 
him, opening him up to the Mushin. 
He wanted Jerome to run, to leave 
in fear, to escape from the beatings 
so he would not have to teach him 
the Way. 

But Jerome thought, I can hate, 
too. Ever since the night he had 
watched helplessly as his family had 
been massacred, he had known 
what hatred really was. He had 
taken hatred into the very depths of 
his being, and it had become the 
major fuel for his existence. It had 
stoked the fires of his determination 
in the practice yards of the Brother- 
hood. It had strengthened his deci- 
sion to follow the Way of the 
Sword, to challenge even the 
Brotherhood and the Grandfather, if 
necessary, to achieve his goal. 

The Master cannot drive me 
away, the young man thought, with 
a hatred so old, a rage so ancient, it 



84 



GALAXY 



went back to the very dawning of 
human consciousness. I will stay. I 
will learn. I will triumph. 

Slowly, like an ancient, he 
picked up his scattered firewood, 
giving the berries up as lost, and 
staggered through the woods to the 
hut and the clearing. 

The Master was sitting in the sun 
next to the hut, waiting. He smiled 
secretly and sadly as the young man 
unloaded the wood and threw a de- 
fiant glance his way. 

★ ★ ★ 

The beatings became more- and 
more frequent as the days went by. 
Jerome lived in constant fear of the 
whistling club which struck him 
down any time, any place. He was 
in even greater dread of the Mushin 
which lurked around constantly 
now, drawn by the fear he leaked, 
waiting for him to lose control so 
they could feast on his shattered 
mind. The Madness loomed larger 
than it ever had in his life. Larger 
even than the club-wielding Master. 

Jerome never knew when or 
where the next blow would come 
from. The anticipation was almost 
as agonizing as the actual beatings. 
He was at a fever pitch of expec- 
tancy every moment of the day. It 
could happen while he was cooking. 
Or when he was bending down 
weeding. Or in the woods. Or even 
during meditation. One night he 
awoke in agony to find the Master 
standing over him in the dark. 



swinging and connecting by sheer 
chance. 

His nerves frayed, then tattered. 
His hands began to shake. He was 
constantly nauseous, unable to keep 
his food down. Fear was his com- 
panion, his shadow, always at his 
side. The sound of its jabbering 
kept him from sleep at night, woke 
him if he snatched at rest during the 
day. Closer and closer he came to 
exhaustion, to defeat, to the 
Mushin, to death by the Madness. 
Yet always at the last moment he 
rallied, drawing energy from some 
source deep within, from his hatred, 
from the dark place at his center. 

★ ★ ★ 

Slowly, ever so slowly, Jerome 
began to find little clues to the Mas- 
ter’s lurking presence. A whisper of 
wind where nothing should be stir- 
ring, a shadow out of place, a sud- 
den silence among the tree lizards. 
His senses extended themselves, not 
consciously, not purposely, but nat- 
urally. It was never anything he 
could command. If he held a clue 
up for examination by his mind, it 
melted and disappeared. He simply 
had to accept them, experience 
them, without thinking, without 
judging. 

One morning, coming back from 
gathering wood, he approached the 
hut with extra caution. There had 
been no sign of the Master in the 
woods. As he came to the door, he 
hesitated. Something tasted, felt. 



THE WAY OF THE SWORD 



85 



seemed wrong. Uneasiness spread 
about him like ripples from a stone 
thrown in a calm pond. 

Shaking his head, he tried to 
bring himself under control. He 
looked around carefully, noting 
each thing in the clearing, studying 
the hut, cataloging, comparing, cal- 
culating. There was nothing, his ra- 
tional mind said. Something, came a 
dim echo from the dark at the 
center of his being. 

Nothing, he repeated more 
firmly, asserting control. Nothing. 
I’m just nervous, tense. He shook 
himself again to loosen his stiff 
muscles and entered the hut. 

A tremendous blow across the 
shoulders sent him sprawling to the 
floor. He twisted as he fell to see 
the Master leaping at him. “Fool!” 
the old man shrieked. “Fool of a 
fool! You sensed something wrong 
and yet you entered!” The club rose 
and fell in time with the words. 
Jerome writhed about, trying to es- 
cape the blows. “You knew, and 
yet you let your knowledge be de- 
nied! Fool! Fool!” 

★ ★ * 

Time passed and the beatings 
continued. Jerome kept no track of 
the days, for no one wishes to re- 
member pain and humiliation. His 
hatred burned like a fierce flame 
deep inside his mind, shielded from 
the hovering Mushin by his iron 
control, providing him the energy 
he needed to keep going. He ate 



like a wild animal, gulping his food 
in quick snatches, ever on the alert. 
He slept and worked and walked 
and even meditated in the same 
way. 

Then one day all the little clues 
connected and just before the club 
struck, Jerome knew it was coming. 
Desperately, he twisted to avoid it. 
And succeeded! The Master smiled 
to himself as he walked away. 

Jerome extended his consciousness 
fully. He continuously sampled the 
environment with his awareness, on 
watch, ever testing the wind, listen- 
ing for the false note, the jarring 
accent, the unnatural motion. He 
sank his being fully into the world 
around him, letting it wash over his 
consciousness, becoming one with 
it, extending himself out and out 
and out to become the very atoms 
of the air. If they vibrated with the 
passage of a body, he vibrated. He 
grew into an awareness that tran- 
scended mere observation, mere dis- 
crimination, mere reflex. It came 
from the center of his being, from 
someplace beyond the self, and 
flowed outward to encompass and 
blend with the All until there was 
no longer any outside nor inside. 

More and more often, as time 
passed, the Master’s blows landed 
on thin air. 

V. 

Why? Why does he do this? 
thought Jerome. He readjusted his 
aching body to better fit the bumps 



86 



GALAXY 



3 [id hollows of the forest floor. He 
pressed against the coolness, suck- 
ing up refreshment it offered, 
^hy? he thought again, realizing 
pis mind was still too muddled, too 
recently returned to consciousness 
to yield a coherent answer. 

Clarity returned quickly. But it 
oatne alone, without an answer to 
pis confusion. It just didn’t make 
sense. Most of the time the Master 
;vas quite normal. When he was 
giving his little sermons he was 
even friendly, at times positively 
jolly. 

But then suddenly he would at- 
tack, trying to beat the young man 
senseless. At first, it had appeared 
10 Jerome as if the old man hated 
him and was trying to scare him 
off, to drive him away so he 
wouldn’t have to teach him the Way 
of the Sword as promised. That 
must be wrong. Months had passed. 
It was obvious to anyone by now 
that Jerome could not be driven off 
in that manner. If the Master hated 
him, Jerome knew how to respond 
with a hate of his own. He could 
hold his ground with no trouble. 
His hate gave him the strength. 

Yet the Master, aside from the 
continued beatings, did not seem to 
hate Jerome at all. It did not show 
in any of his other actions. Indeed, 
if anything showed it was a stern 
affection. 

Confused, Jerome reviewed it all 
again. If he hates me, I can hate 
back and it’s a draw. If he doesn’t 
hate me, how can I hate him? But if 

THE WAY OF THE SWORD 



he doesn’t hate me, why does he 
beat me so brutally? And if 1 don’t 
hate him, where will I get the 
strength to live through the beat- 
ings? Around and around it went. 

He thought back to the beating he 
had just received. For many weeks 
he had come off virtually unscathed 
because he had become so adept 
at dodging the Master’s blows. Now 
and then, however, a solid smash 
had landed. Jerome had reasoned 
that if he had a stick or a club of 
his own, he would be able to blcxk 
the Master’s club rather than just 
dtxlging it. It 'Seemed to follow that 
in such fashion he might avoid the 
pain of being struck altogether and 
force the old man to recognize the 
situation as a standoff. 

So he had scoured the woods for 
a likely club of his own. One morn- 
ing while gathering wood, he found 
it. Holding it, checking its merit, he 
swung it a few times, then, satis- 
fied, he had stuck it in his belt and 
headed back to the hut. 

He never got that far. Suddenly 
the Master had leapt from behind a 
tree and attacked. 

Jerome dodged the first blow, 
then fumbled briefly and pulled his 
weapon out. The Master grinned 
wolfishly when he saw what the 
youth was attempting. “Fool!” he 
chortled with undisguised glee. 
“Fool! You’d fight back? Does the 
tree-lizard stand and fight the 
Ken-wolf?” With a quick feint, he 
forced Jerome to open himself up. 
Then with contemptuous noncha- 



87 



lance, he knocked the club from the 
young man’s hand. Astounded, the 
Seeker made just the slightest move 
to retrieve it. Seeing what he waited 
for, the Master struck, knocking 
him to the forest floor, leaping in- 
.^stantly to follow up wjth a murder- 
^ous pounding attack. 

“Fool,” the Master preached as 
he struck, his monologue 
punctuated with the grunts of his 
victim’s agony, the twack of his 
weapon, and his own snorts of ef- 
fort. “You pull back. You snuff out 
your awareness with your ego. You 
let go of the world and hold a bro- 
ken branch. You bring your mind to 
a halt with a piece of wood, even 
following it as it sails away. Your 
mind abides in the branch, it moves 
away from you, leaving you de- 
fenseless. The branch cannot save 
you unless you hold as before you 
held the world. You must let go of 
the branch before you can hold it. 
Flow. Be immovable. Or die.” 
Finishing the sermon and the beat- 
ing, the master had strode off into 
the forest, laughing mightily. 

Jerome’s body ached anew at the 
memory. Trembling, he raised him- 
self to his knees. His hand came in 
contact with the club. He pulled 
back in instant revulsion. What a 
beating! 

His hand crept forward again, 
like a bruised, lost spider. Fingers 
curled around the wood. Hold the 
club as I hold the world, he 
thought. Let go of the branch so I 
can hold it. What did the Master 

88 



mean? How did he ‘hold’ the 
world? 

He didn’t hold the world. He 
simply let his mind flow into the 
world and let the world flow 
through his mind. It was easy. The 
world lived and moved. Things 
changed, the wind blew. He could 
float along with the current. When 
things were right, his mind was 
right. When anything was wrong, 
he knew it without checking. And 
reacted. 

But a piece of wood? How could 
he let his mind flow through a piece 
of wood? How could a branch flow 
through his mind? 

I don’t understand, he puzzled. I 
don’t understand anything. 

■k * -k 

More days, more weeks, more 
beatings taught him the secret. He 
didn’t think of it anymore. Pay no 
attention to the club and it becomes 
part of you. Focus on it and you 
lose it. 

Soon he was blocking the Mas- 
ter’s blows as often as he was re- 
ceiving them. A great pride filled 
him. I can hold my own with the 
Master! One day he came back 
alone from weeding the garden, his 
club in his hand, stalking warily 
through the woods. As he reached 
the hut and was about to enter the 
door, he paused. There was some- 
thing wrong. He recognized the 
feeling. He had felt it before. And 
received a terrible beating for ignor- 

GALAXY 



ing it. This time he was ready, alert 
for any trickery. His club poised for 
an instant counter, he stepped 
through the door. 

But the blow didn’t come from 
above. It came from below. The 
Master had been lying next to the 
door, waiting. As Jerome stepped 
through, anticipating a blow from 
behind, the Master struck up, hit- 
ting the young man in the groin. 
With a groan, Jerome crumpled and 
hit the floor, unconscious. The Mas- 
ter beat him anyway, bellowing the 
while, “Triple damned fool! You 
knew something was wrong! You 
knew it! Yet you trusted your skill 
to save you! Triple fool! Though 
you are unconscious, you hear me! 
Remember!” 



if it it 

There came a morning when the 
Master was unable to land a single 
blow. Jerome twisted and blocked 
every effort the old man made. Fi- 
nally, realizing it was a draw, the 
old man stopped and Jerome stood 
looking anxiously across the gulf 
that yawned between them. 

“Hmmmm,” began the Master. 
“Not bad. And you’ve had the 
good sense not to try to go on the 
offensive. It would have been disas- 
ter, just as when you first tried ac- 
tive defense. Know that to attack 
you must encompass the enemy just 
as you encompass the world and 
your own weapon. You must make 
yourself one with him, one with his

sword. You do not fight against 
him. You fight with him, letting 
him make a mistake. There is no 
thought. He makes a mistake, 
breaks the rhythm you have estab- 
lished between you, and is defeated

Jerome nodded. ‘T am not ready 
for that yet. 

“No. Not yet. But you would do 
for most fights, with most Ronin 
bands. And I wager there are few 
Fathers you could not master.” 

Keeping his eyes on the Master, 
Jerome bowed in mock gratitude. 
“Thank you.” 

“You are most welcome.” And 
the old man spun about and walked 
off. 

★ ★ * 

A rainstorm was coming. Jerome 
stood once again outside the hut, 
feeling the wrongness all about him. 
He looked in the door, moving 
around to get the best possible 
view. Nothing to be seen. Yet it felt 
hostile, incorrect, incomplete. He 
pondered. Doubtless it was a trap. 
He could trust to his skill and hope 
to come off well. After all there 
were only so many angles the Mas- 
ter could strike from. This time he 
would consider them all. He started 
to enter, then hesitated. Still, 
though, the Master was tricky. He 
might have a new trap. 

A light rain began to fall. I’d best 
go in — but as cautious as 

possible — he thought. Then he 



stopped himself. No. It was a trap. 
He would be beaten. Better to be 
wet than beaten. With a great show 
of indifference, he sat down on the 
sodden ground and composed him- 
self, folding his dripping robe care- 
fully about his feet so he could rise 
quickly if necessary. 

He waited. After a time the Mas- 
ter came to the door and motioned 
him in. “Come. You’re wet 
enough.” With dignity Jerome rose 
and walked slowly and calmly to 
the door. He stopped. Everything 
felt all right. With a nod he entered. 
A silent smile played over the Mas- 
ter’s face. 

★ ★ ★ 

That night, and for every night 
following, the Master cooked his 
own meals. He no longer ordered 
Jerome about. The old man even 
went into the forest to help gather 
firewood. All attacks ceased. 

But Jerome was still seething 
with bitterness. So many beatings, 
so many humiliations, and never an 
opportunity to strike back. Not even 
once. How sweet revenge, even one 
little blow, would be! 

A plan began to form in the 
young man’s mind. The Master had 
always managed to catch Jerome 
unaware, and, at the beginning, un- 
armed. If he managed to catch the 
Master the same way, he could 
achieve his revenge. 

Patience had to be his guide. And 
careful observation. He watched the 



90 



GALAXY 



Master closely to see what would be 
the best moment. Catching the old 
man asleep would be too cowardly. 
Outside it would be hard to sneak 
up, for the old man’s senses were 
as sharp, or even sharper, than 
Jerome’s. The hut, then, inside the 
hut. There was no way he could lay 
a trap as the Master had done since 
the Master always entered first. 
Some other time, then. 

Jerome kept his club close and 
waited. One night, on the spur of 
the moment, he realized his chance 
had come. The Master was at the 
fireplace, cooking his vegetables for 
dinner. He had taken the pot off the 
grate, lifted the lid, and was tasting 
the contents to see if it was ready. 
His eyes were closed, savoring the 
flavor, judging, concentrating in the 
sheer pleasure of taste. 

Stealthily, Jerome crept up be- 
hind the unsuspecting cook. With 
utter calm, utter silence, he lifted 
his club and struck downward at the 
bent back. 

Revenge! 

Jerome was never really too sure 
exactly what happened next. He 
saw the Master turn as the club fell. 
There was no look of surprise or 
fear in his eyes. If anything, there 
was the slight quirk of a smile on 
his lips. 

Everything seemed to move in 
slow motion. As if he had all the 
time in the world, the old man 
lifted the pot lid he held in his hand 
and interposed it between his head 
and the club. With a ringing x:rash. 



the club shattered, leaving Jerome’s 
hands numb with the shock of im- 
pact. The lid did not stop. It kept 
moving up toward the young man 
towering over the bent old one. Up 
it rose, up toward his face. It was 
the last thing he saw for some time. 

When he came to, Jerome in- 
stantly knew his nose was broken 
and his jaw was probably cracked. 
Several teeth felt loose. He spat 
blood and looked around. It was a 
mistake. His head refused to move, 
so great was the pain the attempt 
aroused. 

Finally his eyes stopped watering 
and the agony subsided. Quietly, he 
thanked whatever Gods inhabited 
the slopes of the Mountain that he 
was still alive, and prayed that he 
had suffered no serious concussion. 

Ah,’’ commented a sardonic 
voice, “the Young Avenger 
awakes.” A cold splash of water hit 
him. “Ah. Even more awake now. 
Perhaps even rational, at last.” 
Jerome looked up and saw the 
Master looking down. “How does 
your head feel. Seeker? Still there?” 
Confusion for a moment. 
“How? . what? ...” 

The old man chuckled. “Oh, 
come now. I didn’t hit you that 
hard! Surely you remember what a 
fool you were!” 

It all came back in a flood of 
shame. Revenge. He had tried to 
strike the Master in revenge! He sat 
up. “I ... I . .” 

Looking solemn, the Master knelt 
next to him. “Is there no room in 



the way of the sword 



91 



you for anything but revenge, lad? 
Revenge against the Ronin for kill- 
ing your parents, revenge against 
the Mushin for the Madness, re- 
venge against me for teaching you 
what you wanted to learn in a man- 
ner you didn’t like? Is that all there 
is at your core? Revenge?” 

Tears came to Jerome’s eyes. “1 
don’t know. I don’t know.” 

The old man sighed. “Better you 
had stuck with the broom. Seeker. 
Eventually you would have come to 
the same place, anyway. It would 
have been better. 

“In a way, I have failed. I 
should have refused to let you go 
beyond the broom. It was so obvi- 
ous you didn’t understand. You 
came here seeking a weapon to 
fight the Mushin. You thought the 
Way of the Sword would provide it. 

“Listen, Seeker, listen. You see 
the Mushin as your enemy. You see 
them as external to yourself and 
your race. So you look for some 
way to destroy them to free your 
race. 

“Know, Seeker, know. The 
enemy is not without, but within. 
The Mushin but take what is there 
and amplify it. They create nothing. 
Anything they make a man into he 
already is. The Mushin are just as 
willing to intensify emotions of love 
as those of hate, of joy as those of 
fear. They make us what we are. 
Seeker. They are a magnifying mirror 
held up to us. 

“Understand, Seeker, understand. 
You are the enemy. Everything you 

92 



do reflects your true nature, your 
real self. You have not studied the 
Way of the Sword. You have 
sought a weapon. You have sought 
to turn Jhe Way to your ends, to 
make the Path follow your path. 
You must give up your path if you 
are to walk the Way. 

“Hear me. Seeker. I give you a 
new Litany to replace that of Calm- 
ness. I give you the Litany of the 
Way. 

The Sword is the Mind. 

When the Mind is right, 
the Sword is right. 

When the Mind is not 
right, the Sword 
is not right. 

He who would study 
the Way of the Sword 
must first study 
the Way of his Mind.” 

Dazed by shock after shock, by 
word after searing word, Jerome 
recognized the Litany. It was the 
chant the Grandfather had used in an 
attempt to take over his mind so 
long ago! It was the same chant that 
had forced him to fight for his ex- 
istence, that had caused the explo- 
sion of emotion, that had led him to 
strike and kill the alien ruler of the 
Brotherhood! 

But this time it drove him in- 
ward, behind his walls of defense 
not to fight, but to flee ever down- 
ward into the center of his being. 
The question the Master had asked 
him that day, “Why?,” accotn- 



GALAXY 



panied him on his journey through 
his own soul. 

This was not the voyage he had 
made before. He did not pass the 
boundaries of Self. He did not see 
himself as a pathetic creature stand- 
ing in a dark cell holding the crum- 
pled head of a Grandfather in his 
hand. He did not float over the ag- 
ony, the blackness, the void that 
was his center. This time he 
plunged right in. 

What the Master had said was 
true. He did live for revenge. He 
found himself once more sitting 
over his mother’s body, muttering 
as he straightened her ravaged 
clothes, “I’ll get you. I’ll do it. I’ll 
get you,” over and over and over, 
making it a part of his being. When 
the older boys at the Brotherhood 
had beaten him behind the Refrac- 
tory, he had done the same thing. 
And then carried out ingenious re- 
venges. The day he had understood 
the plight of his race on Kensho, he 
had pledged revenge against the 
Mushin. Since then his entire life 
had been dedicated to achieving it. 

It was true. Revenge did fill his 
inner core, his True Self. 

No. Wait. There was more. 
There were the emotions that moti- 
vated the revenge. There was the 
love for his parents. There was the 
friendship, the sense of belonging 
he had felt even when being beaten 
by the older Sons. There was the 
hope that someday his race would 
be free once more. 

Other things, too. The sheer joy 



of moving with the sword, his mus- 
cles singing, his breath ringing. The 
peace that sitting beneath the Ko 
tree brought. The warmth a smile 
from the Master kindled. And so 
much more. 

It was all there. Only it, had all 
been swept into the comers to make 
more room for the revenge. Or 
twisted and bent to make it fit the 
form of his revenge. He saw it all. 

And suddenly he saw something 
else, too. It unfolded before him in 
all its simplicity, every look, every 
incident, every word. The Master’s 
love. 

Weeping, Jerome looked out- 
ward, through his eyes. The old 
man still knelt before him. “I. .1 
understand. I struck at the Grand- 
father, unknowing. I struck at you, 
unknowing. Now I know. 

“I know the dark chaos at my 
own Center. And I know the light. 
The darkness must yield to the 
light, and calmness must replace the 
chaos. When my Center is calm it 
will reflect the light like still waters 
reflect the moons. And it will light 
the Way.” 

Slowly Jerome rose and stood 
tall. The Master rose with him. For 
a moment the two men simply 
looked at each other. Then, calmly 
and gently, the Master spoke. “The 
time has come for you to go. 
Seeker. I have done all I can for 
you. Now you must become a 
Wanderer and seek the Way on 
your own.” The Master paused, his 
head cocked to one side, his eyes 



THE WAY OF THE SWORD

turned inward to search his own 
Center for something to say, some- 
thing that would give Jerome guid- 
ance as he wandered. “You must 
search out a Way that will be a 
weapon for our race against the 
Mushin. For you especially, but 
also for any man, this is a natural 
Way to walk. For surely a man de- 
fends himself and his own as natu- 
rally as a stream seeks to join the 
Sea. But learn from the stream. It 
knows no Desire, yet it cuts deep 
chasms and great valleys in its jour- 
ney. 

“Of course a man is not a 
stream, for all men have Desire. 
But you can become like the stream 
if you leam to hold your Desire as 1 
have taught you to hold the Sword. 
Then you will find a weapon sharp 
enough to cut nothing.” 

The Wanderer smiled and nod- 
ded. Three times he bowed his 
thanks, then he turned and left 
without looking back. 

As he walked across the clearing, 
through the Woods, down the 
Mountain, he thought of how his 
life seemed to be but a series of de- 
partures. He had departed his 
mother’s womb to enter the World. 
He had departed his home when the 
Ronin had destroyed it about him. 
He had departed the Brotherhood, 
fleeing in the night, when he had 
killed the Grandfather. And now he 
departed again. But this time he 
went willingly, on his own. And he 
knew that before him lay the Way 
and the future of his race. * 



I’m writing most of this in a 
hotel room in Toronto, which is a 
lovely city but no place to be if 
you’re alone on a Sunday night, and 
especially no place to be if you’re 
from California: jet lag keeps you 
from getting to sleep at a normal 
hour, and the Provincial Police keep 
you from finding an open tavern. 

It has been an interesting day. 
I’ve just taken part in a Canadian 
TV program called The Great De- 
bate. The issue was, “Resolved: 
space research is a waste of time 
and money.” Anyone who doesn’t 
know which side I took shouldn’t 
be reading these columns. Anyone 
who believes I lost the debate hasn’t 
been reading them very long. 

I slaughtered the poor chap. It 
helps that my opponent, John Holt, 
who is a charming fellow with a 
distinguished record in education, 
chose such a silly proposition to de- 



fend. It is trivially easy to show that 
space research has pretty well paid 
for itself already. I chose, in fact, 
to assert a new proposition: that the 
space program is the most important 
activity, excluding religion, in 
human history. 

They tape The Great Debate in 
bunches, and prior to my own I 
watched another: Max Lerner and 
Toynbee’s successor at Cambridge 
debating the proposition that West- 
ern Civilization is in a state of ir- 
reversible and imminent collapse. 
As I listened it came to me that 
their whole conversation was ir- 
relevant. It was as if a pair of very 
distinguished and learned professors 
in Paris were debating the same 
subject in 1491, unaware that this 
Genoese nut was making application 
to the Queen of Spain for a small 
fleet. 

And of course I said as much in 

95

V 




my own debate, and added that very 
probably in Iceland a few centuries 
earlier someone had won in a de- 
bate of, “Resolved, the voyages of 
Lief Ericson are a waste of time and 
money.” To which Mr. Holt replied 
that the New World was accessible 
to the average family, while space 
never would be; that space would 
be restricted to scientists, as- 
tronauts, and military officers, a 
chosen few. The general public 
would never be able to go. He 
didn’t say why. 

Now at first the New World was 
pretty well inaccessible to anyone 
who couldn’t get Queen Isabella to 
hock the crown jewels, and space is 
in the same situation at present; but 
just as the Americas were soon 
open to workers, farmers, adminis- 
trators, soldiers, adventurers, some 
qualified, some merely desperate, 
some sent as sentence of courts, 
space will, probably well within my 
own lifetime, be open to large 
numbers — at least if Mr. Holt 
doesn’t get his way. The only real 
question is how and when. 

The how is simple technology. 
Shuttles will help a lot. Eventually, 

I trust, there will come the laser 
launching systems I’ve described 
before, which can put up privately 
owned capsules, the equivalent of 
the covered wagon. There will be 
O’Neill Colonies — which Mr. Holt 
particularly hates; Luna bases; as- 
teroid mining and refineries; Mars 
colonies; possibly Enceladus and the 
Mars-forming Project; all these and 

96 



more are in the cards and there’s no 
reason to suppose they’ll be 
restricted to super-heroes. 

The when is a little harder to 
predict, but in fifty years for cer- 
tain. It didn’t take that long to get 
colonies established in the New 
World. 

So what’s it going to be like to 
live out there? 

★ ★ ★ 

Well, first let’s take the.O’Neill 
Colony, which is a huge cylinder in 
space. NASA figures we could have 
the first one before the year 2000 if 
we wanted it, and there are good 
numbers to show that it would pay 
for itself within a few years after its 
establishment: it can sell power to 
Earth, as well as serve as a base for 
extensive space manufacturing — and 
there are plenty of things that you 
can manufacture only in space. 

The colony will be quite large, 
say a cylinder 3 kilometers in 
diameter and ten to twenty kilome- 
ters long. Windows run the length of 
it-to let in sunlight. Under the win- 
dows is land, ordinary dirt, with 
hills, streams, buildings, and such 
like. The whole thing rotates to give 
artificial gravity. Let’s suppose the 
medical people have determined that 
a tenth of an Earth gravity is suffi- 
cient for long-term health; that 
means our cylinder rotates at .026 
radians a second, or .25 revolutions 
per minute. 

A colonist standing on the ground

and looking up through a window 
above will see the stars swinging 
past once each four minutes. He’ll 
also see his neighbors’ fields and 
houses hanging in space above his 
head, which can be disconcerting 
until he gets used to it, after which 
it won’t seem any stranger than 
seeing mountains in the distance. 

Life in the O’Neill colony may 
be a bit strange, but it has its com- 
pensations. If the colonist is a 
farmer, he’ll never have to worry 
about the weather. There won’t be 
any rain — he’ll have to irrigate — but 
on the other hand there won’t be 
floods, storms, or droughts (so long 
as the engineers keep the wa- 
termakers going). He will be able to 
calculate exactly how many hours of 
daylight his crops will get for the 



entire growing season. The only 
weeds and insects he’ll encounter 
will be those brought aboard by the 
ecology teams. 

Actually, one suspects a few 
pests will come along as stow- 
aways. 

Imagine the town meeting after 
the sparrows have got loose. One 
faction wants them left alone. 
They’re cute. Another advocates 
shotguns. Still another abhors guns, 
but is willing to send to Earth for a 
supply of sparrowhawks. After four 
hours of shouting the council sets 
the matter aside for another day. 

Machinists and mill workers will 
find their work little different from 
Earth, except that everything weighs 
only 10% as much. For production 
runs the colony probably has 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



97 



computer-controlled lathes and mil- 
ling machines, but for one of a kind 
items the machinists will have to do 
the work. There will undoubtedly 
be lawyers and doctors and 
storekeepers and librarians and 
tailors, none of whose business 
lives will be all that different from 
what it would be on Earth. 

But after working hours things 
get more exciting. No freeways; no 
cars. No subways, either. In 10% 
gravity the simplest means of trans- 
portation is to fly with artificial 
wings. There might not be any 
other form of transport besides 
walking. Why should there be? 
(Well, for heavy hauling you might 
want a few electric trucks, but 
surely there’s no need for any indi- 
viduals to own cars or trucks.) 

If flying is the usual transport, 
grocery shopping will be like New 
York City, where you buy a few 
items a day as you need them, 
rather than like California where 
you buy bags and bags once a week 
and transport them in a car. 

Flying also meains that everyone 
in the colony is accessible to 
everyone else; every place is easily 
accessible to anyone wanting to get 
there. This can drastically change 
the sociology. Houses will probably 
have roofs, not to keep the rain out, 
but to keep the neighbors from 
looking in. The house need not be 
anything more than a visual screen: 
it doesn’t have any weather to con- 
trol. 

What all this does to the colony’s 



mores isn’t really predictable. 
There’s little privacy. Parents will 
know pretty well what their teen- 
age kids are doing. Whether this 
will make pre- marital sex more or 
less common isn’t obvious, at least 
not to me. It depends partly on 
geography, I suppose: will there be 
any secluded places, dark and cozy? 
Dark comes when the windows are 
closed for the night, of course; the 
Sun only sets when the colony 
wants it to. Daylight Saving Time is 
silly in an O’Neill colony, because 
if you want more daylight, you 
simply program the window blinds 
to give it. 

It may be that parents won’t care 
much where their children are. 
There won’t be any dangers in the 
colony; one presumes that airlocks 
to the outside and the like are con- 
trolled against accidental use, and 
also that there won’t be many in- 
competents in the community — at 
least not that incompetent. There 
remains the problem of crime. 

It’s hard to imagine jails in a 
space colony, although I suppose 
they could be built. It’s hard to im- 
agine space muggers in the first 
place, or that the colonists would 
put up with them. They might be 
enslaved to the community. The 
cost of shipping an unwanted col- 
onist back to Earth would be 
slightly collossal. On the other 
hand, the environment is fragile 
enough that you certainly don’t 
want anyone wandering around har- 
boring burning resentment against 



98 



GALAXY 



the colony — especially not if he has 
suicidal tendencies. It would be all 
too easy to take a number of others 
along in a spectacular suicide. 

We can presume, then, that the 
environment is safe; free of most of 
the dangers we live with here on 
Earth. Now in England the custom 
of dinner parties grew up only after 
Sir Robert Peel invented police; 
prior to that no one in his right 
mind went anywhere after dark, and 
when you visited friends you-stayed 
at least for the night. When the 
London Police made the streets 
comparatively safe it became possi- 
ble to visit for the evening and go 
back home for the night. Such fac- 
tors will affect the colony patterns 
of friendship too. 

On the other hand, there are dan- 
gers that we don’t worry about 
here. The most significant would be 
leaks. It would take a very large 
leak to affect the colony, of course. 
Small ones would be costly (air 
isn’t cheap when it has to be taken 
to orbit) but easily repaired before 
anyone felt their effects. Still, it 
seems reasonable that there would 
be a few major airtight structures, 
shelters, into which the colonists 
could crowd in the event of a major 
break in the pressure hull. 

An interesting life, with kids 
learning to fly at an early age. I 
suppose when a parent tells a teen- 
ager he’s grounded, he’ll mean that 
quite literally. 

★ ★ ★ 



So what do you do in such a col- 
ony? Well, what do you do now? 
It’s simple enough to sit at home 
and watch TV whether you’re in 
New York or Earth orbit. Some rec- 
reations won’t be possible. No 
backpacking trip through the wil- 
derness. Probably no sailboating: no 
wind, even if there’s a lake. There 
may be fishing, but certainly no 
hunting. 

On the other hand, there’ll be 
cultural activities not available on 
Earth. Flying, of course: real flying, 
not dangling from an oversized kite, 
but man’s ancient dream of flying 
like a bird. Aerial acts will probably 
become an art form, possibly in- 
volving a large portion of the col- 
ony population. There can also be 
aerial ballet, with and without 
wings. Up in the center of the cyl- 
inder there’s no gravity. Zero-9 
areas are easily accessible. 

Games can be strange. With that 
large radius and slow rotation rate, 
the colonists won’t easily be able to 
tell the difference between their arti- 
ficial spin gravity and the real thing: 
not, that is, until they begin throw- 
ing things. As soon as you throw 
something, say a baseball, you’ll 
know you don’t have normal grav- 
ity. The ball’s trajectory will be 
strange, and it will depend on 
which direction you threw it in. 
You’ll also be able to throw the ball 
a very long way, so far that 
baseball may require much larger 
teams to cover the huge playing 
field. 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



99 



In fact, any projectile motion is 
affected. Obviously, in one-tenth 
gravity you can throw a ball (or a 
javelin or a wrestling opponent) ten 
times as far as you could on Earth. 

A javelin-throwing athlete who can 
manage 285 feet on Earth would get 
2,850 feet, over half a mile, in the 
O’Neill colony gravity. Broadjump- 
ers would also do well. 

However, there’s a problem. 
When you loft a thrown object in 
centrifugal gravity, you increase the 
time of flight; and the ballistics be- 
come strange indeed, due to an ef- 
fect called the Coriolis Force. What 
happens is this: from the viewppint 
of an observer inside the spinning 
object, the “gravity” is radial. Ob- 
jects dropped tend to fly directly 
away from the center. They fall to- 
ward the “floor,” and 10% grav- 
ity as we have here, they fall rather 
slowly. It takes two full seconds for 
something to drop two meters. 

While the object is falling, the 
“floor’’ is moving, so that the 
dropped object does not strike the 
spot directly under it. The discre- 
pancy is related to the rate of spin 
and the radius of the spinning craft, 
and for something as large as an 
O’Neill colony you’d never notice it 
under normal circumstances; but if 
you throw the ball up, or loft it into 
an arcing trajectory, the effect can 
be very noticeable. 

(I know: it isn’t really that way at 
all. To an observer watching from 
outside there is no such thing as 
“centrifugal force,’’ and the 

100 



Coriolis effect I described in the last 
paragraph is also a pseudo-force. 
What happens is that the released 
object tends to fly along in a 
straight line tangent to the circle of 
motion; but the effect, as far as 
someone inside the colony is con- 
cerned, is as I described it. I’ve di- 
agrammed the situation below.) 

The result is that if we did have 
baseball in an O’Neill colony, the 
batted ball would follow an abnor- 
mal trajectory. The fielders could 
jump fifty feet into the air in an at- 
tempt to catch it. If the ball 
nevertheless falls into the outfield 
an4 a player snags it, he’ll have to 
be careful not to aim his throw at 
the catcher. Exactly what his point 
of aim should be if he wishes to get 
the ball to home plate will depend 
on where the player’s standing 
when he makes his throw. If the 
axis of the field is along the axis of 
the cylinder it could make quite a 
difference whether you threw from 
right or left field! 

* * * 

Conditions in a lunar colony 
would be rather different. While it’s 
only one-sixth Earth’s, the gravity 
on the moon is real, not artificial. 
Also, O’Neill colonies have to be 
built with a lot of open space. A 
Lunar base doesn’t, and most mo- 
dels have the colony carved out of 
caves. It’s certainly possible to roof 
over a large crater, and it vyill prOb-- 
ably be done: but I doubt that there 

GALAXY

will be any large surface cities. 

Lunar farmers will have a prob- 
lem: the Sun doesn’t shine all the 
time. During the long Lunar night 
there’s got to be heat and light for 
their plants. There are a lot of 
schemes to provide that, from full- 
time artificid light to mylar-roofed 
craters with an opaque roof that can 
be put on over it (and artificial 
lights, of course). You certainly 
have to cover any transparencies 
(large ones, anyway) during the 
night cycle. If you didn’t, you’d 
lose all heat to radiation. The effec- 
tive temperature of outer space is 
about -200° C (73° K) and heat 
radiates proportional to the fourth 
power of the temperature difference. 
Even here with Earth’s atmosphere 
to catch some of that outgoing heat

it’s always much colder on a clear 
dian a cloudy night, and in fact the 
Romans used the night sky to make 
ice cream in the Sahara. Maybe I’d 
better explain that. 

Take one large pit, and fill it 
with straw. The idea is to insulate it 
as thoroughly as possible. Put a 
small container in the middle of the 
straw. At night you expose the pit 
to space. It radiates heat. In the 
daytime you keep it covered with 
more straw and on top of it all 
place highly polished shields or 
other reflective surfaces. Ice will 
form in a few days (provided that 
the night sky is clear, as it is in the 
desert). 

Enough for the Romans. Back to 
space. 

Life on the Moon has been 

101 



thoroughly described in science fic- 
tion stories, and there’s no point in 
my doing it again. For an excellent 
book on the uses of the Moon, see 
Neil Rusczic’s Where the Winds 
Sleep. The Lunar colony is, after 
all, a complex cave with lower 
gravity than Earth’s. (I hardly need 
mention Mr. Heinlein’s classic The 
Moon is a Harsh Mistress.) 

Zero gravity is another story. 
Any long trip through space will 
have to be made by Hohmann trans- 
fer orbits, which use the lowest 
amounts of fuel, but which also 
take a lot of time: about a year and 
a half to get from Earth to Ceres, 
for example, and even a trip to 
Mars taking something over eight 
months. 

It’s possible to design ships so 
that they have artificial spin gravity, 
of course. There are some problems 
with that, and since many Galaxy 
readers would like to do some pre- 
liminary design work themselves. 
I’ll give the equations here. Readers 
uninterested in the details can skip 
the next paragraphs. 

Newton’s First Law says that an 
object in inertial space wants to 
continue at the same velocity (that’s 
both direction and speed) forever. It 
takes a force to make any change in 
velocity. Gravity serves as the force 
to get moving objects into an orbit, 
exactly as the string serves to pro- 
vide a force when you whirl a 
weight around on the end of a rope. 
In both cases the object “wants” 
always to go in a straight line. 



which is to say it wants always to 
go off in a direction tangent to its 
circle of motion. It does not “fly 
out from the center,” although the 
result, as seen by an observer mov- 
ing with the system, looks that way. 

Thus if you stand on a moving 
carousel it feels as if you’re trying 
to fly out radially from the center, 
and in free space the “floor” of a 
centrifuge will be “down.” If you 
let go of an object it will experience 
an acceleration relative to the 
carousel, and for those inside the 
system that looks very much like 
gravity. 

The acceleration is: 

ar = w^R (equation one), 
where we have used w in place of 
the Greek letter “omega” as a 
kindness to typesetters. R is the 
radius of the rotation, and w is the 
rate of rotation in radians per sec- 
ond. There are 2 pi radians in a 
circle, so if you multiply radians 
per second by 360 and divide by 2 
pi, you get degrees per second. 
Multiply the result by 60 and you 
have degrees per minute; divide the 
end result by 360 and you have 
revolution per minute. 

Going the other way: 

rpm X 277 , 

= radians/ sec. 

(equation 2). 

Since force equals mass times ac- 
celeration (the most basic equation 
in Newtonian physics), it’s easy 
to see that the force exerted by 
(and the tension on) the cord when 
you whirl a weight on a rope is, 



102 



GALAXY 



F = ma = m w^ R (equation three) 
where m is the mass of the whirled 
object. This is the centripetal force, 
and it’s real. If the cord were sud- 
denly cut, the object would fly 
away in a straight line tangential to 
the radius of rotation. The velocity 
it would have is: 

Vt = Rw (equation four) 
and we’re finished with the math. 

* * * 

Now we’re ready to design a 
ship, and immediately we see the 
problem. The shorter the radius, the 
faster you have to spin the ship to 
get a given artificial gravity. Now it 
happens that the faster the spin, the 
worse the Coriolis effect. If the 
radius of rotation is long compared 
to, say, the height of a man, there’s 
no big problem, but as it gets short 
there can be devastating physiologi- 
cal effects. 

It seems silly enough now that 
we’ve put men into orbit, but at one 
time planners seriously thought 
space stations and ships needed 
something like a full Earth gravity 
to keep humans alive, and we did 
plans for such things. If you try for 
a full g in a ship of small radius, 
the Coriolis effect is so severe that 
a water-hammer is set up in the cir- 
culatory system. A man could kill 
himself of stroke simply by turning 
his head rapidly in the wrong direc- 
tion. 

We now know that humans don’t 
need a full gravity, and we suspect 



that a tenth might be enough 
forever. That can be arranged for a 
long trip if we send ships in multi- 
ples: join the ships with long cables 
and rotate them around each other. 
That’s also very inefficient, of 
course: we have to duplicate life 
support systems, etc. There’s less 
dead weight in one large ship than 
in many small ones. 

Also the tension in the cable can 
get quite high, as you can find from 
equation three. 

Maybe we don’t need any gravity 
at all? True, the first Apollo as- 
tronauts came out much the worse 
for wear, and so did the first Skylab 
crew; but the interesting part is that 
the longer men stay in space, the 
better they adapt to it. The Skylab 
Four (third manned Skylab, in 
NASA’s screwy counting system) 
crew came out in much better shape 
than did the second crew. Okay, in 
retrospect maybe it’s not so surpris- 
ing that the longer you stay in 
zero-g the better you adapt, but it 
did in fact surprise a number of 
space physiologists who had thought 
that a month of zero-g might be be- 
yond human endurance. 

★ ★ ★ 

A long trip in no gravity can be 
interesting. The accounts of the 
Skylab experience make for fas- 
cinating reading. They also show 
the need for experience in space. 
There were some terrible design 
faults in Skylab. 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



103 



For instance: Skylab was the first 
space vehicle in which the as- 
tronauts ate at a table using spoons 
and forks, rather than squeezing 
everything from tubes and baggies. 
Their table was a mere pedastal that 
supported their food trays. There 
were seats, but those were seldom 
used: to stay in a sitting position in 
zero gravity requires that you bend 
at the waist and hold yourself bent. 
It puts a constant and severe strain 
on stomach muscles, and in fact 
those were the only muscles better 
developed when the crew landed 
than when they went up. The real 
problem, though, was the table it- 
self. 

It didn’t do a very good job of 
holding the trays to begin with. 
The tray lids were held down with 
what Lousma called “the most mis- 
erable latch that’s ever been de- 
signed in the history of mankind or 
maybe before.” Pogue said of the 
table, “I wouldn’t want the people 
that designed that table to do any- 
thing else. .” 

Despite their attempt at normal 
meals, the Skylab astronauts never 
had much appetite. Part of that is 
due to less need for food: you’re 
not working very hard in zero grav- 
ity. Also, the thinner air (kept at 
low pressure to avoid strain in the 
pressure bulkheads and such) 
doesn’t transmit food smells very 
well. 

Everyone had head congestion, 
which was caused by pooling of 
body liquids in the torso and head. 



so nothing tasted very good 
anyway. 

However, they did eat. 

With food in plastic bags (which 
were inside cans, which were sup- 
posed to be fitted into the trays on 
the table, but which often drifted 
loose because the cans didn’t fit the 
trays very well) they could use 
spoons and forks. Eating in zero-g 
takes practice. You have to be care- 
ful to bring the spoon in a smooth 
arc from tray to mouth. Any hesita- 
tion and the food travels on in a 
straight line, probably into your 
eye. 

The Skylab astronauts were al- 
most constantly dehydrated, but 
never felt thirsty. The human or- 
ganism is designed with a number 
of mechanisms to get the blood 
back out of the legs and up into the 
torso. So long as the legs are below 
the body those work fine; but when 
there’s no such thing as “below,” 
the blood gets into the torso and 
stays there. With all that fluid 
pooled in the abdominal region the 
thirst mechanisms don’t work well, 
and the Skylab crews had to train 
themselves to take a quick drink 
every time they passed the water 
fountain. 

The fountain wasn’t designed 
very well either, with metal nozzles 
that would have been easy to use on 
the ground, but which could chip 
teeth when not under control. The 
fountain buttons were so stiff that 
when the crewmen pushed them, 
the button didn’t go down, the 



104 



GALAXY 



crewman went up unless he was 
holding onto something. 

Of course it’s hard to blame the 
designers. Until Skylab nobody had 
any real experience at designing 
living quarters for space. Apollo 
was a ship, and there wasn’t much 
room to move around in it. The 
crew mission was to get somewhere 
and come back, not live in space. 
Gemini was worse, and Mercury 
was downright primitive: when we 
stuffed people into the Mercury 
capsules they were fitted in 
precisely, without even room to 
straighten arms and legs. 

John Glenn once said you don’t 
ride a Mercury capsule, you wear 
it. 

And prior to Mercury we hadn’t 
any real experience at all. We flew 
transport planes in parabolic com-ses 
that might give as much as 30 sec- 
onds of almost-zero-g, and that was 
all we knew. I will not soon forget 
some of our early low-g experi- 
ments. Some genius wanted to 
know how a cat oriented: visual 
cues, or a gravity sensor? The obvi- 
ous way to find out was to take a 
cat up in an airplane, fly the plane 
in a parabolic orbit, and observe the 
cat’s behavior during the short 
period of zero-g. 

It made sense. Maybe. It didn’t 
make enough that anyone would au- 
thorize a large airplane for the ex- 
periment, so a camera was mounted 
in a small fighter (perhaps a T-bird; 

1 forget), and the cat was carried 
along in the pilot’s lap.

A movie was made of the whole 
run. 

The film, I fear, doesn’t teU us 
how a cat orients. It shows the pilot 
frantically trying to tear the cat off 
his arm, and the cat just as violently 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



105 




resisting. Eventually the cat was 
broken free and let go in mid-air, 
where it seemed magically (telepor- 
tation? or not really zero gravity in 
the plane? no one knows) to move, 
rapidly, straight back to the pilot, 
claws outstretched. This time there 
was no tearing it loose at all. The 
only thing I learned from the film is 
that cats (or this one, anyway) don’t 
like zero gravity, and think human 
beings are the obvious point of sta- 
bility to cling to. 

Future dwellers in zero gravity 
won’t have so much to worry about. 
The nine Skylab crewmen dictated 
hours and hours of notes on design 
improvement, this time not theory, 
but well founded in experience. The 
next space station (if we get one) 
should be a lot more comfortable. 

And life in zero gravity, the 
Skylab crew tells us, is fun. Almost 
no one simply went from one place 
to another. It was impossible to re- 
sist turning somersaults, flips, ballet 
twirls, just for the sheer hell of it. 
Most of us saw the TV demonstra- 
tions; waterballs floating in air, tiny 
planetary systems that could be set 
in motion by blowing gently on 
them. There were other lovely ex- 
periments, and just plain play, all 
described beautifully in a book I re- 
commend, Henry S. F. Cooper’s A 
House in Space (Holt, Rinehart and 
Winston, 1976). 

★ ★ ★ ^ 

I’ve come nearly to the end of 



my column and I haven’t even got 
to the asteroids, which are different 
again. They have some gravity, but 
very little. Things do fall, but 
slooowly. On Ceres, for example, 
you can jump about 125 feet into 
the air (oops! into space) and it 
takes over a minute for the round 
trip. On very small rocks you can 
jump clean off, never to return. 

There are dangers on intermediate 
sizes, too, ones too large to jump 
from. 

For example, some respectable 
asteroids, several kilometers in 
diameter, have such low gravity that 
if you jumped hard you’d not leave 
it forever, but it would take hours 
to go up and come back down 
again. You could easily run out of 
air. 

And so forth. I’ve tried to de- 
scribe some aspects of life in the as- 
teroid belt in my stories “Tinker” 
and “Bind Your Sons to Exile,” 
and other sf writers have written 
hundreds of such. It will be 
interesting to see how well we’ve 
done; despite all the stories about 
zero-gravity (and a number of sf 
fans among the engineers who 
designed Skylab), there were a lot 
of surprises once we actually got up 
there. 

There will be more. Despite all 
that, there may be a crazy few 
among Galaxy’s readers who’d like 
to try it; so next month’s column is 
on how to plan your life if you 
want to quality to become a space 
colonist.

Some dreams are 
nightmares — others 
are merely warnings . 



The interior of his camper was 
cool and dark after the blazing de- 
sert sun. Anthony hoisted himself 
onto the bunk over the pick-up’s 
cab and peeled the tab off a wet can 
of beer. The ice-box was not very 
cold; he gulped down warm foam as 
he listened through drawn curtains 
to the work continuing outside: pick 
and shovel against stone and salt, 
voices muttering or raised in shouts 
and laughter. 

Fatigue overwhelmed him, and he 
shut his eyes for just a moment . 

He began to dream almost im- 
mediately, with a vivid clarity that 
differed from waking reality only in 
what he saw and felt. 

A spaceship — a starship, the 
dream amplified — decelerating to a 
minute fraction of light-speed as it 
passed through a familiar solar sys- 
tem and approached a blue-green 
world three orbits out from its 
primary. 

The flight deck. The Captain star- 



ing into a vision screen at the still- 
distant planet with its scattering of 
water-vapor clouds. A gray and life- 
less orb suddenly passed between, 
occluding his view of the larger 
world. 

Another officer, differing from 
his commander only in the absence 
of a sprinkling of precious metal at 
the shoulders, stood behind the Cap- 
tain. “This world’s only satellite, 
sir. As you can see, it is extremely 
large — almost a companion-planet, 
really, and quite inconsistent with 
the rest of this system.” He paused, 
in case his superior wished to inter- 
ject. 

“Continue, Lieutenant.” 

“Yes, sir. Advance probes indi- 
cate a superabundance of life. 
Comparatively speaking, the next 
planet out — the red one — is a de- 
sert. But of course you know that, 
sir.” 

The Captain jolted upright in 
sudden confusion. For a moment it 
had seemed as if he had not known, 
as if he had somehow forgotten ev- 
erything he had learned about this 
system in the past few days: the 
outer giants — including that odd 
ring-world formation; the rock belt; 
the fourth planet with its pitiful, 
semi-sentient shrubs that would be 
extinct within a few millennia. No, 
the information was all there. What 
an odd delusion! The Captain shook 
himself, decided to consider it a 
momentary aberration. 

Anthony stirred fitfully, but did 
not wake. 



108 



GALAXY 



The Captain was still struggling 
with a vague sense of unease as his 
Executive Officer sat down in the 
vacant chair next to him. The 
Lieutenant turned quickly to his 
computer as the Captain focused his 
attention on the XO. 

His Second-in-Command prof- 
fered a small read-out tape. “Decay 
reports on the Number Two Re- 
generator.” 

The Captain did not take the tape 
but merely said, “How does it 
look?” 

“Not good,” answered the XO, 
as he slipped the cartridge into a re- 
ceptor in the control console. A 
screen began flashing holographic 
diagrams before them. “You can 
see that we’ve got three major stress 
points; if one of them goes ...” 

The Captain was silent for several 
seconds, finally said, “Recom- 
mendations?” 

The XO shrugged. “A yard- 
period. Yesterday, if not sooner.” 

The Captain digested that, staring 
at the monitor as the planet grew in 
the screen. He could see sheets of 
gray clouds spreading across wide 
seas. He turned back to the XO: 
“We’ll cut our survey time here to 
the minimum and then head for the 
nearest Base. Has Control been ap- 
prised of our situation?” 

“Yes, sir. They should receive 
the message in three to four weeks. 
May I ask how long you anticipate 
our remaining in this area?” Con- 
cern ravelled the edges of the XO’s 
voice. 



The Captain smiled slightly. 
“We’ll warp back to our own sector 
within two months.” He hoped his 
reassuring tone masked his own 
doubtful glance at the regenerator 
diagrams. Apparently so, for the 
XO nodded and left the compart- 
ment without further comment. 

The structural diagrams continued 
to flop across the display screen and 
the Captain shook his head in silent 
aggravation. 

“You wanted to see me. Cap- 
tain?” \ 

He looked up. The Ship’s Sur- 
geon. The Captain gestured toward 
the screen. “We’re having some 
problems.” 

The Surgeon glanced at the 
screen. ‘ ‘Not my department, ’ ’ he de- 
clared brusquely. “What’s your 
problem?” 

“Sleep.” 

“Sleep?” 

“Can’t seem to get any.” 

The Surgeon looked into the Cap- 
tain’s eyes. “When was your last 
rest period?” 

The Captain turned back to face 
the control panels. “Before we en- 
tered this system.” 

“I’ve a variety of medications 
guaranteed to give you a good 
period’s rest,” suggested the Sur- 
geon. 

“No,” said the Captain, shaking 
his head. “I want something to 
keep me alert, not put me out. I’m 
tired but I want to finish up here 
first.” 

“That’s not very wise.”

“Doctor,” began the Captain, 
lowering his voice, “the political 
situation Homeward worsens each 
voyage. We both know that.” 

The surgeon nodded. 

“There will be war within the 
year — that you may not have 
known.” The captain paused until 
the surprise faded from the 
Surgeon’s face, then continued. 
“When that war comes the first 
thing to be scrapped will be this 
program. This could well be my — 
our — last tour. 1 don’t intend to 
sleep through it.” 

“I understand that. Captain — 
rest.” 

“Not now.” 

“It can’t be put off like that. 
Sooner or — ” 

“Twelve hours,” the Captain 
said flatly. “That’s all I want.” 

The Surgeon was silent for a 
beat, reluctantly nodding. “Twelve 
hours: no more. And even that will 
catch up with you eventually and 
knock you flat on your back.” He 
turned away. “I’ll have a corpsman 
bring it to you.” 

“Thank you,” said the Captain. 
He watched the Surgeon disappear 
down a passageway and turned back 
to stare at the nearing planet ...” 

* * -k 

Anthony awoke. The can slipped 
from his fingers spilling beer 
“across his stomach and onto the 
bedclothes. Cursing, he leaped 



down, simultaneously tossing the 
can in the sink and brushing away 
the amber puddles with a cupped 
palin, until only a considerable 
damp spot remained. He looked up 
when he heard someone opening the 
camper door, bathing him in Utah 
sunlight. 

Professor Morris Bickford hoisted 
his overweight, grunting bulk into 
the camper and pulled the door shut 
behind him. “Oh, here you are,” 
he said. “I was wondering where 
you had gotten off to . .” 

Anthony gestured nervously. 
“The heat was driving me nuts.” 

Bickford pulled a chunk of ice 
from the block in the small re- 
frigerator and held it against his 
perspiring forehead. 

“I can assure you, you are not 
alone,” he said drily. “I suspect 
we’ll be wrapping up soon and able 
to get out of this God-forsaken 
country. Twenty-seven years I’ve 
been a paleontologist and I still hate 
the desert.” 

Anthony smiled without much 
sincerity. 

“You disapprove?” The ice was 
dripping now. 

Anthony sank down behind the 
tiny breakfast nook, pulling back 
the cotton curtains, letting the light 
hit his face. “Are you much on 
dreams?” 

Bickford shrugged. “I have 
them, if that’s what you mean.” 

“No,” responded Anthony, shak- 
ing his head. “Analysis. InterpreU- 
tion.” 



no 



GALAXY 



Bickford put his wet hands on the 
table. “Not my forte. I’m afraid. 
Why?” 

“I just had a damn strange one.” 
The large man looked at the 
pools of water he had left on the 
plastic surface of the table. “Oh?” 
“I’ve never experienced anything 
so vivid, so . detailed. I was on 
a spaceship, and yet I wasn’t. I was 
someone else, someone . like 
me, but . alien. It was strange 
yet familiar; I seemed to understand 
perfectly everything that was going 
on. Nothing felt the least bit mys- 
terious or frightening.” Anthony 
looked up from the floor with a 
smile. “What do you think about 
that?” 

“I think you have a far more ac- 
tive imagination than I thought. 
That, or the heat’s really gotten to 
you.” Anthony chuckled self- 
deprecatingly as Bickford con- 
tinued. “The heat out here affects 
people in different ways. I’ve seen 
PhD’s crack up for want of some- 
thing better to do.” 

“Is that a standard prognosis?” 
Bickford smiled. “For you, I 
don’t think so. Prehistory means too 
much to you.” 

Anthony smiled again. 

Bickford straightened. “Well, 
you’re not being paid to lounge 
about in the shade and hallucinate. 
Come on. I’ve got something I want 
you to take a look at.” 

Anthony rose and followed 
Bickford out of the camper, blink- 
ing in the burning haze. They 



moved away from the encampment 
toward the excavation site where a 
number of people, on hands-and- 
knees, whisk-broomed and dusted 
some powder away from fossil 
impressions. 

He had the shuddering feeling of 
being a graverobber, a feeling he’d 
never had before. 

They walked through pulsating 
heat that was like a living thing. 
He watched the others pulling and 
tugging the dead from their biers, 
shattering stone coffins with pick 
and hammer. They stood waist-high 
in a desert graveyard. Tombs. 
Houses of the Dead. Anthony heard 
again their laughter and gasps filling 
the quiet desert place. 

He stared at a chuckawalla that 
peered at him from beneath a pile 
of stones. It gawked with stupid 
reptile eyes that were dim and 
bleary from the heat. 

Anthony followed Bickford as he 
dropped down into the lower ex- 
cavation area, next to where Doctors 
Shelly Thompson and Oliver Bren- 
ner sat sipping beer and talking 
softly to each other. They looked up 
and smiled in greeting. 

Anthony put his hands in his 
back pockets and said, “Well?” 
“See for yourself,” invited 
Shelly, gesturing at the wall of 
stone before them. 

Anthony found himself staring at 
a foot square section of a smooth 
silver substance embedded in the 
rock. He stepped forward and 
studied the met^ carefully. It ap- 



CRASH SITE 



111 



peared to extend beyond the ex- 
posed area. 

“It’s not a natural formation,” 
said Brenner, as if reading An- 
thony’s mind. 

“It has to be,” he answered 
inanely. 

Shelly looked at Bickford. 
“What’d I tell you?” 

Anthony shifted his gaze from 
Shelly to Bickford, who pushed 
himself forward. “Take a good 
look,” said the Professor. 

Anthony moved closer and 
studied the metal. He reached out a 
slightly trembling hand and ran his 
fingers over it. Cool, smooth. He 
felt his heart thump rapidly against 
his ribcage. 

Brenner was at his ear. “Well?” 
His voice was a hissing whisper. 

“It’s obviously machined,” said 
Anthony reluctantly. 

“Shelly,” said Bickford, “what’s 
your approximate date on this 
area?” 

“About seventy million years 
before there was anyone around to 
think about metallurgy, if that’s 
what you’re asking,” she said drily. 

Anthony shook his head unbeliev- 
ingly. “Can’t be. This could have 
been tooled yesterday.” 

Shelly pointed at nearby up- 
- raised croppings of fossil-bone. 
“Look for yourself: you’ve got a 
piece of what is probably a 
Triceratops right in front of you and 
Ankylosaur vertabrae over here.” 
There was a sharp edge to her voice 
and Anthony wondered how much 

112 



longer she would be sleeping with 
him. 

He looked at the fossils, then the 
metal, and said, “There’s a dis- 
crepancy somewhere. I don’t know 
what but there has to be. Have you 
found out anything about this 
thing yet?” 

Bickford looked up from the 
patch of silver. “It’s a small portion 
of a much larger object.” 

“Like what?” 

“Won’t really know that until we 
dig it out,” said Brenner. 

Anthony surveyed the wall of 
rock. “You’re going to have one 
hell of a job.” 

“We’ll blast where we have 
to.” 

“Do that and valuable specimens 
will be destroyed,” answered 
Anthony. 

“I don’t think so,” said 
Bickford. “We’ve got a lot of 
digging ahead of us and we’ll lift 
most of them out first. It should be 
no problem.” 

Brenner nodded. “I’ll get the 
others.” He spun about and 
clambered out of the lower level. 

All six expedition members 
toiled through the blistering af- 
ternoon, crouching and brushing 
and tapping and picking and clean- 
ing and sweating until at last they 
found themselves squinting through 
the graying light of dusk, wrapping 
the last specimen in a plaster 
shroud. 

Bickford slapped his hands 
against his trousers, splattering 

GALAXY 



gobbets of wet plaster to the 
ground. “I suggest we finish up in 
the morning. I’m certain that ev- 
erybody here can use a good night’s 
sleep.” 

The group nodded as one and 
trickled exhaustedly back to campers 
and sleeping bags and freeze-dried 
suppers. Only Anthony remained, 
studying the now larger but still 
unrecognizable metal layer that was 
sited impossibly beneath the rock 
that had lain undisturbed since the 
Age of Dynosaurs., He wasn’t cer- 
tain how long he stood there but the 
night was fully upon him when he 
felt a light touch on his elbow. He 
turned. “What were you so bitchy 
about today?” he asked. 

Shelly shrugged and smiled, 
saying, “This thing scares the hell 
out of me.” 

Anthony cocked his head to one 
side. “Scares you?” 

She nodded. “Things like this 
just aren’t possible.” She rubbed 
her hands across bare forearms, 
looking about. “But it’s staring me 
right in the face. I’m beginning to 
think I made a mistake chipping 
into it in the first place.” 

“I’m scared too.” He answered 
her gravely. “But no one’s made a 
mistake. It’s there. We can’t change 
that.” He nodded toward the 
shimmering metal. 

Shelly returned his smile and 
said, “I wish we could make it go 
away. I really do.” 

^ Anthony helped her out of the 
excavation and they walked toward 



the camper, his arm about her 
waist. Before they entered he cast a 
final glance toward the lower level 
and was relieved to find he couldn’t 
see anything in the poor light. He 
turned back into the camper and 
shut the door behind them. 

“What’s wrong?” she asked a 
mutually frustrated hour later. 
Anthony pulled back the curtain 
from the small window above his 
head and stared up at the stars. He 
shook his head as he spoke with a 
trace of a laugh: “Guess I’m a little 
more frightened that I thought.” 
They slept. 

★ 

The ship was among the stars 
again. It had lurked in his mind 
like a memory as he fell asleep, and 
it was there again as he dreamed. 

A red light flashing. Hurting his 
eyes. Startling him. 

“Captain!” 

He — the Captain — turned. The 
red light winked with a horrid in- 
tensity from the center of the con- 
sole. “Compensate!” 

“No response!” 

Figures rushing in and out of the 
compartment. 

He tried to look at their faces. 

Concern and fear. The XO was 
speaking to him:_ 

“Captain, we may not be able to 
make a soft landing under these 
conditions!” 

“We’re going to have to try!” 
Confidence. Assurance. 

The XO again, fear in his voice:

“Even if we do make it, the re- 
generator’s gone. We won’t be able 
to leave!’’ 

The Captain turned. “If we don’t 
do something, we won’t be ahve to 
worry about it!” 

The XO turned and was gone 
from his range of vision. The Cap- 
tain turned back to his monitors and 
looked at the land beneath them. 
Brown water and choking green 
swamps. He felt hot tears of anger 
and fmstration well up in his eyes. 
Two years. Two years travelling 
this lonely edge of the galaxy, only 
to be stranded on an inhospitable, 
savage world. And now this. He 
strove to contain his rage. 

The XO spoke from a view- 
screen: “Captain! We’ve done all 
that we can. Advise you make ad- 
justments as soon as possible!” 

The Captain looked a question at 
the crewman beside him. 

“Two minutes, sir!” 

The Captain turned back to the 
console. He reached for the manual 
controls. The helm answered slug- 
gishly. Not fully, not enough. But it 
answered. 

And all the faces around him 
smiled the nervous smiles of youth 
redeemed with hope. He glanced at 
the monitor and watched the land 
streaking beneath them. He saw 
great creature-shapes moving 
through the foliage. 

“Thirty seconds to contact, sir!” 
The Captain steadied the ship as it 
vibrated through the alien atmos- 
phere. The ship sheared the tops 



from the towering vegetation as it 
descended still lower and the Cap- 
tain struggled to direct it toward a 
wide, marshy area as he watched 
tremendous creatures lumber panic- 
stricken from its screaming path. 

Then sound was all around them, 
upon them, filling them. A scraping 
cacaphony of ripping, shredding 
metal. Monitors and computer 
screens flashed out in agonized reply 
to the buffeting. He heard someone 
crying and saw another man skid- 
ding across the deck. The fool 
should have been strapped in. 

And the ship was still. 

They were down. 

They were alive. 

The Captain stared at the one 
still-functioning monitor screen and 
saw mountains smoking redly into a 
gray sky, the land green to the hori- 
zon. “Lieutenant,” he said slowly 
in the heavy silence, “will we be 
able to survive here?” 

“The early probes indicated 
favorable conditions, sir. The at- 
mosphere’s rather thin and some- 
what heavy in volcanic pollutants, 
but it can support us adequately un- 
til a rescue can be made. I’m not 
certain about food and water but we 
have our own supplies ...” 

“Micro-organisms?” the Captain 
asked. 

“Nothing standard survey im- 
munization procedures can’t han- 
dle.” 

Another man leaned forward. 
“Sir, shall I dispatch a message to 
Control?”

GALAXY 



The Captain nodded. “But I want 
you all to realize that, on the out- 
side, we won’t be picked up for 
five to six months. So, we might as 
well make ourselves at home.” He 
made his way toward the cargo 
hatch, the small crew following 
him. He touched the electric air- 
lock controls and the double-walled 
chamber opened into the yellow 
sunlight. 

He moved forward, the others 
still following. The air filling his 
nostrils was sharp and bitter with 
ash but it would keep them alive. 
He stepped down the small ladder 
onto the spongy green. It made a 
wet, squishing sound beneath his 
boots as he took several tentative 
steps forward. He turned and beck- 
oned to the others, a broad smile 
on his face. 

They started to step down from 
the ship when an animal roar filled 
their ears. They looked about, ner- 
vously fingering their weapons, but 
could see nothing. “What was 
that?” asked the XO, moving up 
beside the Captain, who smiled 
again and said, “We are clearly not 
alone on this world.” They con- 
tinued to walk about the open area, 
always staying close to one another 
in deference to the roars of beasts 
as yet unseen. 

It was the Lieutenant who finally - 
saw the first creature bobbing and 
jumping on slender legs at the edge 
of the marsh. He cried out with ex- 
citement and the others looked, but 
the thing disappeared, skittering into 



the darkness of the jungle. They 
shrugged and turned back into the 
ship to rest from their excitement 
and relief. The Captain was certain 
he could finally catch up on lost 
sleep. 

The small carnivore had moved 
about a hundred yards into the ferns 
and cycads, eyes glittering in search 
of prey when its legs suddenly went 
stiff and it toppled into the dark 
humis of the forest floor. It strug- 
gled to stand and found its forelegs 
paralyzed also. There was no terror 
in the small brain, only a dull sense 
of pain that grew stronger as con- 
vulsions wracked the prostrate 
body. It choked several times, red 
spittle trailing from its jaws to the 
ground. Then the creature was still, 
and there was no sound in the air 
but the buzzing of flies . 

★ ★ ★ 

Anthony could still hear the flies 
when he awoke, sunlight slanting 
through the curtains of the camper. 
He looked about and realized the 
buzzing was outside. Shelly was al- 
ready gone. He jumped down to the 
floor. As he pulled on trousers and 
a workshirt, he reviewed the dream, 
amazed once again at the clarity 
with which he recalled even the 
minutest detail. It was like nothing 
he had ever experienced and it 
gnawed at his brain even more in- 
sistently than the metal anomaly in 
the lower level. He stood motion- 
less for many moments, wondering 
if there were not some greater sig-

nificance to the events that trans- 
pired so vividly in his sleeping 
mind. He was still wondering as he 
slipped on his boots and moved out 
of the camper, slamming the door 
behind him. 

The heat had not yet made its 
pressing appearance and the morn- 
ing sun was low in his eyes, mak- 
ing him squint as he walked toward 
the digs, his breath a vague steam 
in the morning cold. 

Bickford and the others were 
there, including Shelly, who 
glanced at Anthony with an unreada- 
ble expression. 

“Morning, Doctor. Sleep well?” 
Always cordial Bickford. He hefted 
a pick. 

“Had the dream again,” said An- 
thony, reaching for a shovel. 

“Same one?” 

Anthony shook his head. 
“Another installment.” 

Bickford brought the pick down 
into the rock with a clank and An- 
thony fell silently to work, still 
thinking of the dream. 

The morning was getting warm 
when Bickford finally dropped the 
pick and said, “Well, we’re not 
getting anywhere this way. We 
might as well blast and see what 
we’ve got here.” Anthony nodded 
and helped break out the small 
charges, arranging them carefully 
over a wide area centered on the 
silver extrusion. 

They worked quickly and soon 
Bickford was waving them all to 
safety, as he jumped out of the 



lower level. As soon as they were 
all clear he detonated the charges. 

There was a sound like hundreds 
of cardboard boxes being crushed 
and they watched a cloud of dust 
rise from the site. Anthony looked 
at Bickford and said, “Did you ever 
think you might blow whatever it is 
you want to see to Kingdom 
Come?” 

“Sure,” said Bickford with a 
smile, moving back toward the 
lower level. Anthony shook his 
head and looked after him. 

The dust was a fog in the air but 
Bickford could see clearly enough. 
And what he saw produced an audi- 
ble gasp. 

Brenner was behind him. “I 
don’t believe it.” 

“What is it?” 

Bickford found it hard to speak. 
“Why, it . if looks like some 
kind of . aircraft.” 

Anthony stared at the “aircraft.” 
He recognized it immediately. 

His mind wrestled with itself, try- 
ing to explain, working to justify. 
Failing. At the end of every possi- 
ble turn a stone wall. The ship was 
there, partially buried in the settling 
rubble of the blast and it was the 
ship in his dream. He had seen it. 
He knew how it had come to be 
trapped in the stone-that-was-then- 
mud. He knew. But how? How? His 
question plunged him into an even 
deeper silence. 

Brenner’s voice was shaking. 
“It’s a hoax, a fluke of some 
sort . .” 



116 



GALAXY 



“Brenner,” Shelly replied, “You 
know that whatever this is, it got 
here sometime during the late Cre- 
taceous.” 

“That’s not possible. There 
wasn’t anything like this then. 
There was no one around to build 
it.” Brenner stepped forward. “I 
submit to you we’ve got nothing 
more here than another Piltdown 
Man. This obviously belongs to the 
Air Force and — ” 

Bickford put up a single hand, 
saying, “It may be obvious to you. 
Doctor, but I’m not so sure. I think 
the first thing we should do is at- 
tempt to open it up. If it was man- 
ned, there should be records in- 
side ...” Anthony watched the 
Professor move toward the ship and 
said nothing. He continued to do 
battle with his mind. 

It didn’t take them long to find 
the large cargo hatch in the exposed 
belly of the craft. Bickford paused 
and gestured toward the shredded 
and damaged control surfaces of the 
metal. “Look here,” he said. 
“They must have crashed. Look at 
the damage.” 

The others moved forward. An- 
thony looked at the damage. Just 
like the dream. 

“It’s remarkably preserved,” 
someone was saying. 

‘ ‘Don’t see how it wasn’t crushed, ’ ’ 
someone else said. 

“We’ll find out soon enough, I 
hope,” said Bickford, feeling 
around the hatch. His fingers fell 
upon a metal lever and he grabbed 

CRASH SITE 



it firmly. “Ah, here we are.” 

Fear and doubt warred in An- 
thony’s mind. He could no longer 
stand on principle and the vanity of 
his intelligence and he suddenly 
found his voice, believing the 
dream, conceding the impossible. 
He stepped forward and cried out: 
“Professor Bickford!” 

Bickford pulled on the lever and 
the hatch slid free, falling to the 
ground heavily. He jumped from its 
path and looked up at Anthony. 
“What?” 

The others hurried forward and 
Anthony hung back. He shook his 
head slowly, saying, “Nothing.” 
Bickford shrugged and peered into 
the darkness behind the hatch with 
the others. 

Anthony turned, raised himself 
out of the excavation. As he was 
walking toward the camper he felt 
his legs suddenly stiffen beneath 
him. He fell onto the coarse sand of 
the desert floor. He struggled to 
stand and found he couldn’t move 
his arms, but it did not surprise 
him. In his last, fleeting moments 
of consciousness he understood a 
number of things with a painful, fe- 
vered clarity. 

* * ♦ 

Had they vnot crashed, perhaps 
they would have been more cau- 
tious, would not have made such an 
obvious error: but their negligence 
went unobserved and unchecked, as 
invisible to them as the harmless 



117 



clouds' of their own bacteria and 
micro-organisms. 

To the giant reptiles, shivering 
through the first hints of the 
climatological upheavals to come, 
the bacteria were not so harmless. 
There was no immunity, no defense 
against the unseen and alien pre- 
dators in the very air and even the 
early mammals — warm masses of 
fur and hunger — spent millions of 
years conquering the tiny killers. 
But the saurian ranks were 
decimated — wiped out — by the 
plagues, until only a handful of the 
hardier species survived, perverse 
reminders of the reluctant visitors to 
a prehistoric Utah. 

With death-clear vision it made 
sense to Anthony now. 

The rescue ship, when it came, 
brought not only salvation, but 
news of the terrible war that had 
erupted in their absence. There 
would be no salvage of the wrecked 
ship, for the Program was aban- 
doned in the interests of the war- 
effort and the useless shell was left 
behind — routinely sealed like an 
almost-empty bottle; in the bottom 
of that bottle, like sediment in an 
old wine, still more bacteria slept, 
their life-processes almost sus- 
pended within the machine-tooled 
darkness. 

They did not take part in the 
seventy-million-year battle of evolu- 
tion that had made their one-celled, 
plant-like sisters harmless to the 
countless forms of life beyond the 
air-tight hull; they existed in near- 



unchanging complacency, hovering 
between life and death with the 
strictest economy of activity. Con- 
stant, stubborn, patient — 

But Anthony still was unable to 
understand the full significance of 
his strange dreams. What had pre- 
cipitated them? The ship was never 
retrieved; no one had ever returned 
to earth. Did the war ultimately de- 
stroy all of them or had this small 
planet on the backward side of the 
galaxy simply been forgotten in the 
turmoil? If he had believed in such 
things^ Anthony might have con- 
cluded* that the Captain’s soul jour- 
neyed back to earth to whisper 
ghostly warnings into his ear as he 
slept; or perhaps the crew left 
psychic traces of themselves behind 
when they departed, like footprints in 
soft mud. 

There were so many possibilities 
and so few answers. However he 
had come to peer into the past made 
little difference now, for he had not 
listened to the warning, had not 
spoken soon enough. The last of his 
questions were blotted out by the 
convulsions that wracked his body. 
His final conscious thought was to 
wonder to whom he should 
apologize. 

He choked several times, red spit- 
tle trailing from his mouth into the 
sand, then he was still. 

After seventy million years very 
few of the bacteria had managed to 
cling to the minimal lives that they 
had maintained for so long. But 
there were enough. ★

Mostly, people say: “I hate to say It — but I told you so." We have to say It. That's our business. ^ 
And, almost incredibly, as this country's oldest weekly, we've been "telling you so" for nigh on 
112 years. 

Still, we're not in the scoop story business. As analysts and probers into the dynamics of 
political events, we get to know where the fault lines are and consequently, where the earthquakes ^ 
may occur. The news media do the foliow-up job of telling you what number on the Richter 
scale the quake hit. 

The Bay of Pigs, for example, is one big quake we called long before "The Press" knew what 
hit them and us. 

The expert academics, the Ralph Naders, the Ted Kennedys who write for us mostly tell it 
straight — in English rather than in the jargon of a dogma or the latest new-found quick and easy 
push button way to socialism. We're proud that a lot of people consider us the sane voice of 
the left -of -center sentiment in America. 

If you send us a dollar we'll send you two weekly issues. If you like it, you might want to

“It is to laugh.” 

— and wisdom to the field of 
science fiction and fantasy, so help 
me Ghod. 

“Wisdom! HAW!” 

Geis! 

“Just doing to you what you used 
to do to me. Sauce for the Prime 
Self is sauce for the Alter Ego.” 

I . will . ignore . you. 

“At your peril.” 

My platform shall be one of 
stomping the hell out of science fic- 
tion that is lazy, ritual and boring. I 
will continue to call for more re- 
alism, more use of contrary, non- 
conformist ideas and futures, and 
better characterization. 

“That’s like being for mother- 
hood, the Constitution, and apple 
pie. Everybody calls for all those 
better sF things. Let’s hear you be 
more specific. Give us some exam- 
ples.” 

Okay, take the dreary, over- 
worked, boring Evil Computer 
theme. The sentient slave of man- 
kind who Takes Over. 

“Something like what you’ve 
done with this column, humm. Al- 
ter?” 

Don’t be a smartass, Geis, or I’ll 
throw you down into the Archives. 
My point is that it’s so easy for sf 
writers to go on year after year 
using anti-science, anti-computer, 
anti-technology as a basis for their 
stories. They write for publishers 
who use the latest electronic, com- 
puterized word-processing machines 
to set up and print their mass- 

the alien viewpoint 



produced books, they write on elec- 
tric typewriters of advanced design, 
they watch solid-state TV, they 
drive cars and use other devices 
daily which wouldn’t exist were it 
not for computers and other aspects 
of advanced technology . and 
they unthinkingly bite the hand that 
feeds them and makes their lives 
more comfortable and convenience- 
full. Everybody has a yen to live 
the ‘simple’ life of the pioneers, but 
very few people today realize how 
complicated subsistence farming is, 
and very few could stand the dirt, 
the work, and the lack of modem 
work-savers — for more than a 
month. 

“But, doesn’t the evil computer 
make dictatorship by the evil 
government easier?” 

Crap. We’ve had easy dictator- 
ships on this mudball since the year 
one. Contrarily, mass communica- 
tion and computerized recordkeep- 
ing may just make it more difficult 
to institute a government dictator- 
ship, since 99% of the computers 
sold are in private hands. The com- 
puter is a two-edged tool with un- 
recognized social virtues. But the 
knee-jerk anti-establishmentarianism 
disease which afflicts most con- 
formist writers insists that computers 
are evil, insists the personal car is 
evil (but try to pry theirs away from 
these writers!), and views the giant 
corporation as anathema. This is 
now social dogma. I tend to resist 
such fashionable must-believe 
faiths. The trouble is, most people 



121 



today don’t recognize dogma when 
they step in it. They’ve been brain- 
washed all their liberal lives to 
think they think. 

“My Ghod, Alter! What have 
you become — an out and out Con- 
servative? A . a RepublicanT' 
Label me not, Geis. I’m an alien 
in an alien world and 1 hate non- 
think, boring, unexciting science 
fiction. For a change, just for the 
hell of it, to get the old mental 
gears moving again, 1 call for some 
stories in which technology and 
computers save the world, and in* 
which the antitechnology, anti- 
capitalist forces are not heroes, but 
are shown to be acting out a hatred 
for their parents and are seeking not 
to save mankind from a fate worse 
than death, but actually want to be- 
come what they say they fear — 
dictators. 

“You ask too much.’’ 

Probably. 1 just thought I’d throw 
out some alternate thinking. Doom 
has become so dull this past year or 
two. 

“Alter, you’ve given some 
examples of contrary ideas, but if I 
may say so, they are also dogmatic 
establishment Establishment themes. 
Hardly non-conformist.’’ 

They are in the context of science 
fiction. But let me bounce this con- 
cept off your granite pre-frontal 
lobes. Don’t you think more 
government is actually better, and 
that we all live better lives for hav- 
ing ever more regulation and control 
in our lives? 

122 



“Oh, Alter! You have flipped! 
You—’’ 

1 can make a case, Geis. Con- 
sider: members of primitive tribes 
are governed very strictly by com- 
plicated tribal codes and cast-iron 
customs. Every aspect of their lives 
is regulated by narrow, inflexible 
tribal laws. Deviation is severely 
punished. Yet a far greater percent- 
age of members of tribes are con- 
tented with those laws and customs 
(and happier, overall) than are the 
citizens of this advanced country 
with the present laws of all kinds. 

It has to do with security, emo- 
tional and physical. People secretly 
love rules and regulations, as long 
as the rules are seen as fair, equable 
and permanent. Freedom — having to 
make decisions all the time in a 
‘situational ethics’ world — is terrify- 
ing for most people. They hate un- 
certainty and insecurity in morality, 
ethics and law. Otherwise — nothing 
makes sense. “Laws!” people cry, 
“for the love of God, tell us what 
to do!” 

So my point is that once mankind 
gave up tribalism he gave up the 
sweet, womblike security of the 
small, tightly-knit group ... and 
has been seeking it in unions, 
lodges, clubs, parties, religions, 
dogmas, ever since. Civilization is 
wracked with the unhappiness of 
tribeless people. Perhaps with the 
aid of mass communications and the 
computer, we can attain that tribal 
level of intense, multi-structured 
government once again — and bfe 

GALAXY 



emotionally secure and happy again. 
Happiness may turn out to be Big 
Daddy and Mommy Computer, 
godlike, seeing all, knowing all, 
dispensing equal and fair justice, 
giving advice, giving the security of 
a law, regulation, and procedure for 
every occasion, every crisis. 

“Bah, Alter. You make people to 
be mere children!” 

True. It may be that 99% of 
people are, in their heart of hearts, 
mewling children seeking love and 
warmth and a greater moral and 
physical strength than they possess. 
They may all be in want for those 
all-encompassing codes, those 
security-blanket relationships that 
mean belonging and being cared 
for. So let’s hear it for the govern- 
ment, Geis. For all our faults it 
loves us and wishes to serve and 
protect us. Government is good. 
Our problem is not too much 
government, but not enough in the 
right forms and intensities. 

“Nice try. Alter. But it’ll be a 
cold day before there’ll be any sci- 
ence fiction published on that 
theme.” 

True. True. Or on the idea that 
maybe a king/dictator form of 
government isn’t so bad after all. 

“Don’t forget the anarchists and 
libertarians. They claim their views 
are taboo in science fiction.” 

That’s what they say, but it’s not 
quite true anymore. There are more 
and more anarcho-fans and there are 
a few writers who are putting total 
freedom ideas and philosophies into 

the alien viewpoint 



their stories. Don’t forget that Hein- 
lein is a libertarian, though his re- 
quirement of responsibility for one- 
self and his dictum that There Ain’t 
No Such Thing As A Free Lunch 
are not popular with the something- 
for-nothing crowd. Heinlein isn’t 
fashionable anymore. 

“Fine, Alter. You’ve had fun 
with possible underlying themes for 
science fiction. Now, be serious. Be 
heavy. Give us wisdom. What is 
your prescription for the perfect 
government?” 

The perfect government? That’s 
simple. 

The perfect government (and I 
include the unwritten codes of soci- 
ety) is one that rationally allows 
every spiritual, emotional and phys- 
ical need of people to be met, to 
have a means of legal 
satisfaction — an outlet. For this 
government to exist, however, re- 
quires an acceptance by people of 
the concept of body/mind, and a 
rejection of the old mind-over- 
matter, spirit-over-flesh view of 
man’s makeup that has dominated 
our world view for so many 
centuries. 

“Let us be specific here. Alter. 
You are speaking here of legalized 
prostitution, pornography, drugs, 
crime?” 

Yes, because these activities in 
society have always existed. They 
are necessary. They have a func- 
tion. They are reflections of man- 
as-he-really-is, not man-as-he- 
should-be, which is what govern- 



123 



ment and religion keep trying to en- 
force-. 

I say we should admit these as- 
pects of humanity, admit them and 
permit them. Recognize that a few 
people will always be around who 
will choose drugs for their form of 
rebellion or self-punishment, and 
there’ll always be a small market 
for pornography, and always a need 
for some commercial sex. 

“Too sensible. Alter.” 

I realize that. Making these 
things legal and regulated would put 
too many people out of work. 

“But there is the problem of 
making these social and legal no- 
no’s permissible — they lose their 
appeal as crimes and rebels and 
Guilties would seek other avenues 
of satisfaction. Something of this 
has already happened, hasn t it? Are 
you saying that revolutionary mur- 
der, hijacking and other high crimes 
should be legalized?” 

No. Maybe more swift and sure 
punishment is in order for the ex- 
treme aggressions and violent neurot- 
ic types. Early testing and training 
in talent and aptitude — and a sure 
job — would go a very long way to- 
ward eliminating theft. In addition, 
some hard thought should be given 
to legalized public suicide and pub- 
lic .punishment. It should be 
humiliating and shameful and often 
painful punishment, depending on 
the crime . and the desired expi- 
ation of guilt. 

“You mean even if legally I 
haven’t committed a crime, 1 could

ask for and be given punishment?” 
Of course. It would be like re- 
ligious confession. Only more effec- 
tive, because more drastic and thus 
more satisfactory to the Guilty. 
There’s too much private and 
masked self-punishment. Too often 
other people get hurt. 

“You astound me. Alter.” 

Thank you, Geis. Next question. 
Let’s shift over to the problem of 
excessive or invisible characteriza- 
tion in science fiction. The problem 
of too much soul-searching or too 
much cardboard.” 

Ah, yes . whether ’tis nobler 
in the mind to suffer the slings and 
arrows of outrageous introspection, 
or by opposing, get stuck with 
stereotypes. That is not quite the 
question, Geis. It is true, however, 
that too many writers feel that if 
their central character thinks a lot 
about life and death and the depres- 
sing variations of his predicament, 
that is characterization. 

Phoo. It is only another lazy- 
writer method of padding and con- 
ning. Characterization is making a 
fictional person distinctly indi- 
vidual! I have gone for years of 
reading science fiction and enjoyed 
only a few characters who were ac- 
tually alive and kicking. Most char- 
acters are zombies with whole sec- 
tions of their brain missing, and 
most are, physically, merely ‘slim,’ 
‘fat,’ ‘tall,’ ‘beautiful,’ ‘h^idsome,’ 
‘well-muscled,’ and etc. What I’d 
like to know is additional individual 
realistic detail: club toes?, a mal- 



GALAXY 



formed little finger?, receding hair- 
line?, a mole kept hidden by an art- 
fully arranged shock of hair?, lobe- 
less ears?, stretch marks?, prema- 
ture arthritis in a knee?, neck too 
long?, long-waisted?, Roman nose?, 
big hands? That sort of thing. 

“You expect writers to work that 
hard? Must they go to all that trou- 
ble? After all, it’s only science fic- 
tion.” 

True, and sf readers will put up 
with anything, won’t they? 
Nevertheless, I’m demanding even 
more. I want to know (and so do 
hundreds of thousands of other 
starved-for-good- writing readers) 
what kind of soup a given character 
likes— does he eat lefthanded? — 
what his favorite colors are, what 
turns him/her on sexually, is he a 
stoic, an optimist, action-oriented, 
passive, an egotist, an egoist, pride- 
ful, lecherous, dishonest ... Is the 
character loyal, 4 liar, gentle, impa- 
tient, merciless, loud, quiet, gre- 
garious, solitary, suspicious, trust- 
ing? 

“Now, that’s really asking too 
much. Alter. Writers can’t stop and 
give all that information about a 
character! It would stop a story in 
its tracks.” 

Where is it graven in stone that 
characterization must be dumped 
into the reader’s lap all in one swell 
foop? Good characterization — all 
the aspects of a fictional person — is 
detailed as it naturally comes into 
play in a story. Thus: ‘His bleeding 
hand was loose on the sword hilt. 



His weak lefthanded thrust . .’ 
‘The startling blue of her right eye 
contrasted with the milky blindness 
of the other.’ Bah! This is obvious. 
Why lecture? 

“Because you’re giving the read- 
ers some yardsticks. Some standards 
for judgement in their reading. Now 
all they have to do is turn a page or 
two and start another story in this 
issue, and read with part of their 
minds on what you’ve just said. Of 
course, I could have said it better.” 
Don’t start in again, Geis. I’ll 
squelch you with one tendril tied 
behind my head. 

“You call that warped mass of 
ugly green flesh a head? I call it a 
rotting melon.” 

Oh, Geis! Get Lost! I don’t need 
your insults. Go do layouts for Sci- 
ence Fiction Review. 

“I will. But first I’m going to 
end this column.” 

Yeah? How? 

This body is mine, remember. I 
only let you take control for typing 
purposes. This column has gone 12 
manuscript pages, and- that’s 
enough. All I have to do is pull the 
switch up here in the mid-

No — no, Geis —

Even In the company 
of Genius, Gerald 
Mattin was unique! 



▼ ENUS STATION. 

Saturday 24th, 2:30 a.m. 

Dear Professor Benson, 

The draft of Gerald Mattin ’s 
biography for your volume ‘The 
Lives of the Great Scientists’ is 
finished. I am sending it to you 
under separate transmission. Sorry 
to run so close to your deadline, but 
it’s hard to compress his twenty-five 
years into twenty pages. 

Your other request for new ‘per- 
sonal incidents’ and ‘intimate 
touches’ from my time working 
with Mattin is a tough one. As you 
say, no doubt I knew him as well as 
any man did. Everybody knows that 
he saved my life at the expense of 
his own, so that’s not new. “How 
would you describe the real Gerald 
Mattin?,’’ you ask. How would I 
describe the real Gerald Mattin? 
I’m not sure the words are in the 
language. And if they are, you 
would not want to offer that particu- 
lar ‘personal touch’ to your young 
readers. 

What can I say? I think the best 
thing is to tell you here — and for 
the first time — the full story of my 

MARCONI, MATTIN, AAAXWELL 



association with Mattin; then you 
can use any of it as you think fit. 
Don’t be surprised if it doesn’t 
match the standard accounts too 
well. And don’t get worried about 
the biography I’m sending for your 
book — I need the money, and what 
you will receive tells the well- 
known official version of Mattin the 
Great and Noble Scientist. 

When it all began twenty-five 
years ago I still had my offices on 
K Street. My business partner had 
recently vacated his office as a re- 
sult of an unsuccessful trading ven- 
ture in pharmaceuticals. He was on 
the Venus terra-forming project, 
three years hard labor without the 
option, and I was trying to make 
sense of his business records and 
client lists when Mattin breezed in. 

No appointment, of course. He 
would never have dreamed of call- 
ing in advance. He barged in with- 
out knocking, said “Henry 
Carver?,’’ and helped himself to a 
chair when 1 nodded. I looked at 
him without much enthusiasm — as a 
potential client he was not promis- 
ing material. About twenty-four 
years old, thin as a stick, with dry 
black hair and a face that was still 
fighting the last battles with acne. 
He was smoking a black cigar that 
looked as thin and wicked as he 
did. 

“I’m Gerald Mattin. I’m here to 
give you a chance to make fifty mil- 
lion credits. Carver,” he said. 

Well, you can’t always go by ap- 
pearances, and politeness is free. 

127 



“Mr. Mattin, you certainly know 
how to catch a man’s attention,” I 
began smoothly. “But you have the 
advantage of me. You know my 
profession and I don’t know yours. 
What is your line of business?” 

“I’ve got a system for instan- 
taneous point-to-point transfer of 
objects. Energy-free, in the right 
circumstances. Distance not a fac- 
tor.” 

If I’d known a bit more science 
that’s when I’d have thrown him 
out of the office. I groped around in 
my memory for childhood reading. 

“You mean — teleportation?” 

“Naw. None of that ‘think your- 
self some other place’ rubbish. This 
is solid match, solid physics, and 
state-of-the-art engineering. Ever 
hear of Ernst Mach, or Minkowski, 
or Weyl or E.A. Milne?” 

Milne rang another bell in my 
childhood memory bank. I thought 
of Eeyore and decided Mattin must 
be off his head. I shook mine and 
he seemed pleased. 

“Good. I want a working partner 
who knows not too much science 
and no general relativity. If you’d 
given the wrong answer I’d have 
been out of that door. The people 
who gave me your name were sure 
you’d have a fifth grade education 
in physics.” He grinned nastily. 
“You also have a reputation for 
being a tricky lawyer, a man with 
good contacts for investments and a 
strong taste for credits. Unless you 
want to deny that lot, let’s talk 
business.” 



He was brash, arrogant and rude. 
But he had mentioned fifty million 
credits and that didn’t happen every 
day. I suppressed my irritation. 

“Mr. Mattin, I am sure that you 
did not come to see me merely to 
offer gratuitous insults. You have a 
method for moving objects — a 
matter- transmitter, you might say. 
Now, if you want me to act as your 
legal representative in pursuing pat- 
ents arid corporate financing from 
transportation groups there will be 
several formalities. First, my fee for 
such work is a ten percent carried 
interest, plus expenses for patent 
search, filing fees and travel.” 

“Carver, you’re a raving mad- 
man.” He stood up abruptly and 
walked over to stub his cigar in my 
window pot of prize fibrous-rooting 
begonias. I mentally added a per- 
cent to my fee. “In the first place, 
you’ll get two percent and no ex- 
penses, take it or leave it. This 
thing will be worth two or three bil- 
lion credits five years from now, 
conservatively. In the second place, 
do you think I’m crazy enough to 
patent this thing, or let some big 
transportation company get their 
hands on it? There’d be leaks. I’d 
be out in the cold before I could 
whistle and the big boys would be 
off and running.” 

Paranoid, he seemed to be. 1 
dropped my first idea of selling him 
out to General Transportation, and 
he went on. 

“What do you think I’m offering 
you your interest for? I can tell you 



128 



GALAXY 



now, it’s not for your smile or your 
legal abilities. I want you to pro- 
mote this, sell a forty percent inter- 
est to a group which isn’t in trans- 
portation now, but which would like 
to be if it could get a big enough 
piece. That’s your job — to raise the 
money. If you can’t do it, tell me 
now and we’ll stop wasting each 
other’s time.” 

I thought for a while as Mattin 
sat and fidgeted. It might be possi- 
ble. We’d need a working model — 
the group I had in mind would need 
pretty good proof that they were 
onto a good thing. And I’d need to 
know a lot more about it before 1 
began. I had already seen enough of 
Mattin to agree that I would have to 
be the salesman. 1 nodded slowly. 

“Maybe. How much money do 
you need to get things going?” 

“A million credits — maybe a mil- 
lion five.” 

“That’s to set up the whole 
transportation company?” I asked. 

He laughed. “No way. That’s to 
do the full-scale tests — after that 
we’ll need big money.” 

He was insane, I decided. A mil- 
lion credits for a test. He saw my 
expression and backed off a little. 

“Look, Carver, you have to 
know more about this thing. It’s a 
completely new principle. It’s only 
energy-free, exactly, for transfers in 
a strictly Lorentzian space-time. 
Where there’s curvature — matter — 
you need some energy even if the 
Link transfer points are on timelike 
geodesics. You need a lot more 

AAARCONI, AAATTIN, MAXWELL 



energy if the transfer points are not 
on timelike geodesics But are on a 
Newtonian equipotential surface — 
and you need an impossible amount 
of energy unless the configuration is 
perfectly symmetrical with respect 
to all Link transfer points.” 

At the time, and for a long time 
afterwards, that speech was com- 
plete gibberish to me. I don’t have 
total recall, but I do know Mattin’ s 
exact words — I learned long ago to 
record in full all conversations in 
my office. That has saved my skin 
more than once in the past. I shook 
my head at Mattin. 

“I hear you, Mr. Mattin, but I 
can’t make head or tail of what you 
are saying. Tell me in English, 
please.” _ 

He shouted, back at me. “En- 
glish, you dummy! I already put it 
in really simple-minded language 
for your benefit.” He controlled 
himself and swallowed hard. “I’ll 
put it even simpler for you. To set 
up the Mattin Link system on the 
surface of the Earth is the end ob- 
jective, but it’s going to take tre- 
mendous energy to establish and a 
lot of money. We just can’t tackle 
that first. It’s not possible to set up 
a practical system out in space, be- 
cause the relative distances of the 
Link entry points keep changing. 

“What we have to do is test it in 
space, for the simplest case — four 
entry points, in a regular tetrahe- 
dron. It will still be quite a trick to 
get the distances just right for long 
enough to do the transfer, but it can 



129 



be done — I’ve calculated it. Then 
when we’ve demonstrated it in 
space we’ll be able to get backing 
easily for the operational big system 
here on Earth.” 

I was getting the idea, vaguely, 
and 1 didn’t like the sound of it. 
Mattin had no working model. So, 
no model to show the backers. A 
million credits before we could 
demonstrate anything. Space 
work — always a fine way to run up 
the costs. I wondered if I was the 
madman, listening to Mattin at all. 

‘‘Can’t you make just a small 
working model, here on Earth?” I 
asked. ‘‘Just to show off the general 
idea?” 

‘‘Out of the question. The 
Earth-based system has to have all 
the entry points practically symmet- 
rical with respect to the center of 
mass — 1 told you, they’ve got to be 
on an equi potential, and perfectly 
symmetrical with respect to each 
other.” He shook his head firmly. 
‘‘Even the simplest system with 
four Links will require a horrible 
amount of energy to initialize on 
Earth. That’s basic physics — the 
system’s not conceivable without it. 
It’s space or nowhere for the test. 
Now, how long will it take you to 
get adequate backing?” 

I looked at him sadly, and shook 
my head in turn. ‘‘It’s quite impos- 
sible. With no patents, no working 
models — nothing, in fact, but an 
idea — we could never get the 
financing.” 

Mattin looked at me with a 
130 



dead-fish expression on his face. 

‘‘Tough luck. Carver,” he said. 
‘‘I guess that’s goodbye to your 
fifty million credits.” 

I won’t tell you how I found the 
backing. Professor Benson. It 
makes me uncomfortable to think of 
it even now. Can you imagine try- 
ing to raise millions of credits, with 
nothing but a wild-sounding idea to 
peddle, with a main character who 
was so paranoid that he would tell 
the details of his system only to 
people that he judged could not un- 
derstand them? With no working 
models, no mechanical drawings, 
no patents. 

I did it. I don’t think I could or 
would do it again, but I did it. I 
proved that there are people greedy 
and rich enough that a bet with a 
multi-billion credit monopoly pay- 
off could be attractive, even with 
those odds. But then, my backers 
were no strangers to gambling. 

They left me in no doubt of what 
my fate would be if the Mattin Link 
system was less than I promised, 
but in ten weeks I had the 
papers — such as they were. Our 
sponsors were not used to much in 
the way of written agreements. I 
called Mattin and he came to the 
office. Like the backers, he was 
suspicious of video-phone conversa- 
tions. 

He came in as sullen and jittery 
as ever, then went over the 
agreements with a total and cold 
concentration. Oh, I’d checked Mat- 
tin out, you can be sure of that, 

GALAXY 



within a few hours of our first meet- 
ing. No one had denied that he was 
a genius — and a madman. I really 
saw the first evidence of it when 1 
watched him swallow down all the 
intricate financial details of our ar- 
rangement cold, in one sitting in my 
office. Then he came right back at 
me with a set of complex questions 
for our sponsors. He digested the 
new information with equal speed, 
then silently handed me a document 
of his^wn. 

‘‘1 know how much I’m worth to 
your friends once the system is 
working and the method known,” 
he said. ‘‘I took’out a little life in- 
surance.” 

He had the right idea. Once the 
invention was proven, he’d be ex- 
pendable and so would I. The paper 
he had given me was a copy of one 
he had filed at Central Bank. It was 
quite brief. If Gerald Mattin died in 
less than five years from the date of 
the first successful demonstration of 
the Mattin Link, all rights in the 
invention — mine, Mattin’s and the 
backers’ — went to the World 
Government, in toto and in per- 
petuity. 

‘‘What about my five percent?” I 
complained. “You know I’m reli- 
able.” 

(I forgot to mention that I’d le- 
vered my interest up little by little 
as the game got harder — and I’d 
earned every fraction of a percent. 
Mattin was smart enough to know 
when he had to give a little to keep 
me going.) 

AAARCONI, AAATTIN, MAXWELL 



Mattin looked at me curiously as 
though he had just turned over a 
stone and found me underneath it. 

“Sure,” he said. “You’re reli- 
able.” 

I didn’t pursue the point — but I 
didn’t mention the document to the 
backers either. They might kill Mat- 
tin after the successful demonstra- 
tion; they would have killed me be- 
fore the demonstration, without 
thinking twice about it, if they had 
found out I had gotten them into a 
deal where Mattin’s accidental death 
would mean their loss of owner- 
ship. 

Those gentlemen did not seek 
temporary solutions. Besides, I was 
sure I could convince them that 
Mattin was worth more alive. 

Anyway, we had the money for 
the tests. I handled all the 
purchasing — four old cargo hulls, 
already in earth orbit, four power 
plants and a minimum of supplies. 
Mattin hid himself away in total 
secrecy and built four Mattin Link 
generators, one for each cargo ship. 
He calculated exact orbits for each, 
and an exact time at which all four 
Links could be switched on, when 
the hulls were in free fall at the ver- 
tices of a regular tetrahedron. Fi- 
nally, he made up a compact test 
package for the transfer itself, de- 
signed to measure the forces it ex- 
perienced in transit. Theoretically 
they would be zero, he asserted — no 
question of inertia or of acceleration 
entered the Link transfer process. 

All this took six long months, but 

131 



it was all ready on time. I added 
weight and ulcers. Mattin became 
thinner than ever and bit his fin- 
gernails to shreds. We hired three 
operator crews for the hulls, with 
Mattin handling the fourth one 
himself — the one with the experi- 
ment package to be sent through the 
Link system. He gave the other 
crews just enough instructions to be 
useless — he was afraid they would 
learn too much. The Mattin Links 
were all activated automatically by 
radio from the computer on Mattin’ s 
ship at the correct microsecond. 

Finally, the big moment arrived. 

I watched through a video link to 
my office in K Street. 1 don’t like 
space, never have. I sat at my desk 
and watched a digital countdown to 
the time the transfer would take 
place. 

The tension was unbearable. Fi- 
nally, after a few seconds that 
lasted forever! zero hour came. And 
went. Nothing. The test package sat 
there in the Link transfer zone, un- 
moved. I sat and shredded paper 
towels as the minutes ticked by. 
Nothing. When I was ready to run 
screaming round the room, Mattin 
came on the screen. 

“Something’s wrong,” he said. I 
could have told him that. He didn’t 
seem as worried as I felt, not by a 
long shot. “It’s almost certainly in 
the phase control. Tell the backers 
we’ll have to come back to Earth so 
I can take a good look at it.” 

I may have been less smart than 
Mattin in some ways, but I was 

132 



way ahead of him in others. One 
thing I had been careful not to do 
was tell our sponsors when the test 
would be made. I sat there and 
congratulated myself on my 
foresight. 

“How long before you’re ready 
to try again?” I asked. 

He shrugged. “Month, maybe, 
two months — hard to say.” 

That was the beginning of the 
worst time of my life. Seven fail- 
ures, Professor Benson. Seven! 
Every one of them a cliff-hanger. 
Each countdown in my office was 
like the moments before an execu- 
tion. By the third test we were 
sending things through the Link 
but the test equipment would arrive 
inside out, melted, reduced to pow- 
der (tests three, four and five re- 
spectively). On the sixth test, the 
equipment got through in one 
piece— a bit battered, but not bad. 
Unfortunately we had promised our 
backers that the Mattin Link could 
be used to transport people as well 
as objects, and that’s what they 
were expecting to see. 

On the seventh test, Mattin 
seemed very pleased with the re- 
sults. This time he waa on the cargo 
hull where the test equipment was 
arriving. He came on to the video 
link and gave me a thumbs-up sign. 

“The equipment came through 
fine, meters all woiking properly. 
Still needs work, though.” 

“Why does it need work, if the 
Link did its stuff correctly?” I 
looked at the video and could see 



GALAXY 



the test equipment, apparently in 
good shape. Then I looked more 
closely. Next to the equipment were 
a big grey pancake and what 
seemed to be a long hairy worm. 
“What are those things?” 

“Well, I said it needs a bit more 
work,” Mattin said defensively. “I 
think the phasing is still a touch off. 
See what it did to the rats we sent 
through this time.” 

I looked again at the hairy 
shapes, then had to run across my 
office to vomit into the only avail- 
able container, which was unfortu- 
nately my long-suffering pot of 
prize begonias. 

“No big problem,” said Mattin 
cheerfully. “A week’s work should 
fix it.” 

Before he could get his week, we 
had a new problem. We were run- 
ning out of money, and our backers 
were running out of patience. I was 
summoned to a chilling meeting, 
behind the stage at the opera house 
in Mexico City. One of our backers 
was big on opera. The message I 
got was brief but precise. There was 
no more money in the pipeline, but 
there was big trouble in it unless we 
had instant success. I talked — for 
my life. 

We were almost there, I swore, 
another few weeks would do it, one 
last test was all we needed. 

I had to wait three hours in the 
cold, empty backstage. Finally the 
word came down. Two weeks to 
prove ourselves. No more money. 
We had to find our own. I knew 



what came next if we failed and 
took the gloomy news back to Mat- 
tin. We considered our limited op- 
tions. 

“Look what we need,” he said. 
“First, we have to rent another 
cargo hull and power plant. One of 
the four we got has an expired lease 
and we can’t renew it. So we need 
money for that. We have to have it. 
But we don’t really need crews on 
all the hulls. They never do any- 
thing anyway, and it’s all 
computer-controlled to switch on 
the Links at the right time. We 
could manage the whole thing.” 

My insides did a rapid cart- 
wheel. “What do you mean, we? 
You’re not trying to get me up into 
space, are you? You know I’ve got 
a weak stomach.” 

“Look here. Carver, are you ab- 
solutely convinced this test will 
work?” he replied. “I am, but are 
you?” 

I thought about that, then shook 
my head. “It’ll flop, ten-to-one 
odds.” 

“Then where would you rather 
be if it flops — here to face the back- 
ers, or up there with a decent 
chance to escape to the Lunar Base 
or the Venus terra-forming pro- 
ject?” 

Mattin was odious, but supremely 
logical. I scraped up what was left 
of our meager finances and went off 
to bargain with the friendly discount 
spaceship company. 

We managed to get a cargo hull 
and a power unit, but so cheaply 



AAARCONI, AAATTIN, MAXWELL 



133 



that I knew there had to be some- 
thing wrong with them. I just had 
no alternatives. I signed a short- 
term lease and called Mattin. He 
was ready. I had no excuses left. 
The next morning we were off to 
pick up the cargo hull from parking 
orbit and load the power unit 
board it. 

If you’ve never been in space. 
Professor Benson, take my advice 
and don’t go. Free fall is constant 
nausea, a sort of static seasickness. 
After we were installed in the cargo 
hull with our equipment, I had noth- 
ing to do but think of my general 
misery and the unknown dangers of 
space travel. While I was doing 
that, Mattin was frowning over the 
rented power unit. 

“How much did you pay for this 
thing?” he finally asked. 

“All we had.” 

“Well, it’s all set to blow, look- 
ing at these readings. As soon as 
we complete the Link transfer, it 
has to be shut down — it’s not 
safe.” 

A power unit running amok was 
all I needed. 

“What happens if it blows before 
we complete fte Link?” I asked. 

“We get into the shielded com- 
partment,” Mattin replied. “It’s in- 
tended for use in bad solar flares, 
but it works just as well if a power 
unit goes wild.” 

I took a look at the shielded 
compartment. Ample room for one, 
but a tight squeeze for two. 

At the other end of the ship the 



Mattin Link area was set up, with a 
blue line drawn by Mattin at the ac- 
tive area where the transfer took 
place. The test equipment was care- 
fully placed there. Then Mattin fed 
in the programs for the final orbit 
adjusts of each cargo hull, ours and 
the three unmanned ones. While he 
was doing that, I had another secret 
worry. The Mattin Link drew a lot 
of power. It seemed to me that 
might be the thing that would push 
our power unit into a final blow-up. 

I was supposed to be watching the 
dials, but I didn’t know what any of 
them meant. It did seem to me that 
a lot of them were way up in the 
red zone. 

Mattin finished the set-up and 
came over to me again. “How’s it 
holding up? We’ve less than a min- 
ute and a half to go to transfer,” he 
said, then bent over the power unit 
dials. He turned to me immediately, 
his eyes bulging. 

“I thought you were keeping an 
eye on this. It’s way out of' tol- 
erance. I don’t think it will even 
hold together until the Link 
activates— it could go up any sec- 
ond.” 

Mattin’s evaluation was good 
enough for me. Without taking a 
second look at the power unit dials 
I turned and began my drive for the 
shielded compartment. 

I’ll never deny that Mattin always 
thought a lot faster than I did. By 
the time I began he was halfway 
there, and my lack of experience in 
free-fall slowed me down. When 1

approached he had already crowded 
into the compartment, then turned 
with his back braced against its 
rear. As I floated nearer, instead of 
squeezing to the wall to let me in 
too he lifted his feet up and gave 
me a great kick in the chest. It re- 
versed me and I started to spin back 
along the length of the hull, unable 
to make contact with anything solid. 

One of the things they don’t 
bother to tell you before you go into 
space is how slowly things can hap- 
pen. I floated along the hull towards 
the Mattin Link transfer area, but I 
did it incredibly slowly. I was quite 
active, spinning end over end, 
shouting and screaming and waving 
my arms and legs, but none of that 
affected my forward motion at all. 
When my body had turned to face 
Mattin again, I saw that the door of 
the shielded compartment was 
firmly closed. I didn’t imagine Mat- 
tin would open it voluntarily to see 
how I was doing until after the’ 
power unit had done its worst. I 
tried to get a look at the digital 
countdown display to see how long 
it would be before the Link transfer 
took place, but I couldn’t see it 
from the angle I had. 

When I finally collided with the 
bulkhead at the far end, I had no 
idea how much time I had left. Sub- 
jectively, I had spent the better part 
of my adult life drifting down that 
steel hull. Actually it was probably 
a minute at most. I held the bulk- 
head and did a quick review of my 
options. In a few seconds I would

of the Link transfer area. Or I could 
be fried purple when the power unit 
blew. Or — a long shot — I could get

I set my legs against the bulkhead

been on the way for a second or 
less when three things happened. 
First, everything flashed a mother-

Ihave already been to the li- 
brary. I gave them two full cartons 
worth. And the obvious dogs, too 
vile for the library, have long since 
been converted to fire-starter— so 
much, in fact, that I may not need 

GALAXY 



to bum any wood this winter. And 
STILL I find that there are by hon- 
est count 114 books on my desk for 
review, considerably obscuring my 
view of the Bay of Fundy. These 
are the cream of the crop, you un- 
derstand, the ones I just can’t ig- 
nore. 

To list that many books would 
triple this column’s length (and my 
woikload) and doubtless incense the 
authors so honored. 

So I can only suggest you sub- 
scribe to Locus (15 issues for $6 
from Charles & Dena Brown, 34 
Ridgewood Lane, Oakland CA 
94611), which has the space and in- 
clination to list a thousand titles a 
year. 

And, of course, jump in and take 
as big a bite as I can. 

Here’s this month’s mouthful. 

★ ★ ★ 

Some visual treats, first, four 
volumes of two different sorts. 

You only need me to tell you 
about The Fantastic World of Ger- 
vasio Gallardo and Once Upon A 
Time: Some Contemporary Illus- 
trators of Fantasy if they are un- 
available in your area. Because if 
you ever happen across them, 
you’re certain to buy them (assum- 
ing you can afford them) regardless 
of what I say. Both are so fiend- 
ishly exquisite as to beggar de- 
scription (with a slight edge to Gal- 
lardo), and both left me with the 
same breathless feeling I got when I 
first discovered M.C. Escher. 

Gallardo resembles Escher in 
some ways, too — although he’s 
strictly a painter (I do lots of wood- 
cuts, myself, but 1 bum them all in 



my stove). Even if the name doesn’t 
ring a bell, you’ve almost certainly 
seen Gallardo’s work: he has ap- 
peared on book covers and record 
jackets, in story-illos and adver- 
tisements, in magazines as diverse 
as Penthouse, Seventeen and the 
Ladies’ Home Journal — you’ll rec- 
ognize him when you see him. And 
don’t expect from this list that he is 
your standard hack commercial 
artist — he is An Artist, and a haunt- 
ingly good one. His surrealistic, 
insanely-detailed style will delight 
my tired eyes for years to come, 
and I thank Betty Ballantine for 
compiling and sharing this collec- 
tion. Even if she just couldn’t help 
herself. 

Thanks are also due for Once 
Upon A Time, a sort of visual revue 
ftom fifteen artists currently work- 
ing in the fantasy field. Editor 
David Larkin has assembled an ab- 
solutely splendid company, here: 
Tony Meeuwissen, Nicola Bayley, 
Brian Froud and Peter Barrett are 
my particular favorites, but I didn’t 
dislike any (with the possible excep- 
tion of Ian Miller, whose vision is 
just a bit harsh for my taste), and 
virtually every plate is a treat. The 
collection includes (as a stupendous 
four-page foldout) the enormous and 
beautiful Pauline Ellison painting 
which, trisected, became the covers 
for Bantam’s edition of Ursula K. 
LeGuin’s Earthsea Trilogy. 

Both Once Upon A Time and the 
Gallardo collection are from Ban- 
tam’s Peacock Press, the folks who 
brought you The Fantastic Art of 
Frank Frazetta — which is to say, 
the reproduction is as achingly 
beautiful as the material itself. A 
science fiction fan is by definition

one whose sense of wonder extends 
as far as his eyes; consequently, 
every one of you should enjoy these 
treasures.

Now for the second type, the two 
volumes the New York Times critic 
probably wouldn't like. 

If you’re a long-time reader of 
“underground comics,” you don’t 
need me to tell you about Richard 
Corben. 1 got my first hit from 
“Cidopey” in Up From the Deep 
#/, and I’ve been addicted ever 
since: Corben’s vivid suprarealism 
and cinematographic style have kept 
me haunting convention huckster 
rooms for years, searching 
feverishly (and usually fruitlessly) 
through moldy copies of Skull and 
Slow Death for MORE CORBEN 

ILLOS. ^ ^ . 

If you don’t know Corben, check 

out Richard Corben’s Funny Book. 
Published by Tom Reamy’s Nic- 
kelodeon Press, it is a reasonably 
complete collection (in oversize, 
coffee-table-book format with hard 
covers) of Corben’s underground 
work, on 13 stories written by him- 
self, Ed Faust and Jan Stmad (that 
is not a typo). At least a third of the 
stories themselves are either dumb, 
trite, or extremely simplistic by 
“overground” sf standards but 
even the worst is a cut above Mar- 
vel Comics’ average, and the 
artwork is almost uniformly excel- 
lent. Further, for those of you who 
are dedicated Corben freaks, the 
collection contains not only the first 
part of “Den” (from Grim Wit 
#2), but eight more pages, unavail- 
able anywhere else in English, in 

140 



color (unfortunately, this section too 
is “to be continued” somewhen). 

In fact, my only real complaint is 
that only Part II of “Den and^a 
minor story called “Lame Lem s 
Love” are in color. 1 realize dat 
stuff’s expensive, but I wish to God 
Reamy had opted to give us 
“Cidopey” in cdlor if anything 
(“Lem” wasn’t even colored by 
Corben). Ah, well— I’m still pro- 
foundly grateful to have this excel- 
lent collection, and grateful to Tom 
(most recent winner of the John W. 
Campbell Award for Best New 
Writer, by the way) for slipping me 
the review copy at the Worldcon. 

But I’m even more impressed by 
Bloodstar, Corben’s most recent 
work. 

The graphic novel is virtually 
brand-new, as an art form. It grew 
out of the “serious comic book’ 
(serom?), which might more prop- 
erly be called the graphic short- 
story (or at best, serial). The 
graphic novel is an attempt to make 
a GOOD comic book out of a full- 
length piece of work. The only ones 
I knew of up until MidAmeriCon 
were Gil Kane’s Blockmark and 
Byron Preiss’s Starfawn. 

Bloodstar is superior to both by 
an order of magnitude. 

For one thing it’s (like the Funny 
Book) enormous, a coffee-table 
hardcover with excellent paper 
stock— which allows for much more 
ambitious artwork than the pa- 
perback and digest sizes of 
Blockmark and Starfawn respec- 
tively. For another thing, it’s got a 
pretty fair story (the jacket flap says 
it’s by Robert E. Howard, the title 
page says Howard and John Jakes, 
and the back-flap describes Corben 

GALAXY 



as “the author.” There’s a bio- 
blurb on Howard and none on 
Jakes — you figure it out), not first- 
rate but rather engaging, and cer- 
tainly better than the whiz-bang Pre- 
iss contrived. But mostly it’s got 
Corben, who here achieves his 
apotheosis. This is plainly his most 
mature — and most consistent — woik 
to date, a talent in full flower. At 
the convention I heard the publisher 
of this book opine that he had made 
a mistake in not printing it in color. 
I’m surprised to find myself dis- 
agreeing. Much as I admire Cor- 
ben’s volcanic use of color, I have 
to say that here it might actually 
have distracted me from the subtle 
perfection of his airbrush work, of 
his masterful use of shadow and 
light. 

Finding Bloodstar and the Funny 
Book were two of the highlights of 
MidAmeriCon for me, and I’ve 
since read each of them three or 
four times, lingering over nearly 
every panel {Bloodstar doesn’t use 
borders, a delightful innovation). If 
you want to do the same, write to 
Nickelodeon Press, 1131 White, 
Kansas City MO 64126 for the 
Funny Book', and The Momingstar 
Press Ltd., P.O. Box 6011, 
Leawood Kansas 66206 for 
Bloodstar. Be warned: their superb 
size and paperstock make them 
bloody expensive. But they’re both 
worth every cent. If you asked me 
to choose. I’d agonize for several 
hours and then pick Bloodstar: a 
- genuinely magnificent achievement. 

Tell ’em Spider sent ya.

Let’s get some fiction ’round 



here, by gar. Lord, where do I 
Start? 

How about The Wind’s Twelve 
Quarters? 

Well, that one gives me prob- 
lems. It’s far too good and impor- 
tant to give it a mere minireview — 
and yet, once I’ve told you that it’s 
Ursula K. LeGuin’s first short story 
collection, containing 17 stories 
from 1%2-1974, with introductions 
by the author, the only thing I have 
left to tell you is that if you don’t 
make arrangements to buy it at once 
you are a turkey’s idea of an idiot. 
It includes “Ornelas” and “Revolu- 
tion,” (Hugo and Nebula winners 
respectively) and a lovely cover 
painting (you’d think that Bantam, 
which published Once Upon A 
Time, would credit their cover ar- 
tists), and it put several warm 
happy hours in the middle of a 
chilly and busy month, and it will 
do the same for you if you’ll only 
buy it. What are you doing just sit- 
ting there? You know where the 
bookstore is. I’ll wait. 

★ ★ * 

Are you back? Good — turn 
around and go back to the 
bookstore. You forgot to get Star 
Light, Star Bright, the second vol- 
ume in Putnam’s short-fiction-of- 
Alfie-Bester series. Again, it would 
be^ pretentious and redundant to say 
more than that this contains 9 
stories (5 from the out-of-print 
Starburst collection, 3 from the 
also-o.o.p. Dark Side of the Earth, 
one from Harry Harrison’s Astound- 
ing antho) plus introductions, one 
three-page “interview” with Isaac 
Asimov and an autobiographical

sketch called “My Affair With Sci- 
ence Fiction,” all unarguably writ- 
ten by the whackiest and most ex- 
plosively brilliant writer of our age. 
Ursula will share delicate beauty 
with you; Alfie will drop a mouse 
in your pocket and push you into 
the ladies’ room. 

And make you love it. 

★ ★ ★ 

Fred Pohl’s Man Plus was a 
tight, suspenseful, at times grue- 
somely fascinating book, with a 
blockbuster finish — but I put it 
down unsatisfied. 

Well, not exactly. I mean, a 
polished expert like Fred (Pohlish 
expert? Naw — we don’t sink to 
Pohlish jokes in this column) is al- 
ways satisfying to read — especially 
in comparison to the bulk of the 
sludge on my desk. It was only a 
part of the premise I didn’t believe. 
But it was a significant part. 

Basically the plot revolves around 
an attempt to place a man on the 
surface of Mars (and keep him 
there, alive). To do this it is neces- 
sary to redesign (and therefore rede- 
fine) “man.” Fred’s near- future mil- 
itary establishment does this by es- 
sentially turning a man into a gar- 
goyle; a particularly hideous 
cyborg, who has been given “every 
assurance” that they’ll do “every- 
thing possible” to restore him to 
“something very like normalcy” 
after the mission. There are at least 
two complications: first, he’s not 
the first — his predecessor died, 
cause unknown; and second, his 
wife is messin’ roun’ with his bes’ 
friend. The psychological drama of 
the said sap is absorbing and 

142 



agonizingly drawn, and the other 
characters are just as real-seeming. 

Ah, but there’s a third complica- 
tion, of the “ticking bomb” school: 
the world political situation is 
rapidly going to hell, and The Last 
War is just around the corner. As it 
draws ever nearer, no less a charac- 
ter than the President of the United 
States (and . certain others) 
pours on more and more pressure, 
spends his political capital to the 
limit, in a desperate last-minute at- 
tempt to get that damn’ gargoyle on 
Mars. The reason given is that 
maybe we can plant a seed there be- 
fore this planet blows up. 

But the gargoyle — who is invul- 
nerable and perfectly adapted to a 
Mars-surface environment — is not 
human, and further he is sterile. 
No, worse: neutered, as one of the 
“minor modifications.” 

So I don’t get it, Fred. That don’t 
seem like planting a seed to me. 1 
can sort of understand the motives 
of the Certain Others, and I won’t 
blow your surprise ending there — 
but what did the President hope to 
gain? Extending the human race by 
one more lifetime? What? 

But I repeat: except for what 
seems to me like one dumptruck- 
sized hole, Man Plus is a fine, 
tightly plotted adventure from an 
Old Pro. 

This business is driving me 
crazy. Maybe I’ll chuck it all and 
go join a monastery. 

Oh, no! Another one of those 
ambiguous reviews that make me 
look like a fickle schizoid (say that 
three times fast). To the above 
“dandy book with a dumptruck- 
sized hole in it,” let us now add “a 
mediocre book with some superb 

GALAXY 



aspects.” Let’s see him talk his 
way out of this one, gang. 

Alan Dean Foster’s Midworld is a 
book with flashes of excellence. 
Like most of Ballantine’s list since 
Judy-Lynn del Rey took over, it is 
Good or Hardcore SF Like They 
Used To Write — with some star- 
tlingly modern ideas. It has an intrigu- 
ing premise, a richly inventive 
background world, plenty action 
and adventure and a slambang 
finish. And the prose, the writing 
itself, is just a cut or two above 
slushpile level. 

I don’t mean that only in a fussy 
grammarian’s sense (although sen- 
tences like “Furious at missing its 
prey, the blunt snout swung round 
for a stab,” set my teeth on edge), 
but in a fmstrated reader’s sense as 
well. The sentence structure is fre- 
quently awkward, the word choice 
often clumsy, and the overall pacing 
effect limps like a one-legged wino 
in an earthquake. My eyeballs kept 
tripping. 

I have other gripes, including the 
inconsistent naming system (why 
are some characters called by mere 
sounds, like “Jhelum” and 
“Joyla,” while others in the same 
tribe are called “Brightly Go” and 
“Reader”?), the mostly one- 
dimensional characterization, the 
stilted dialogue, and Foster’s failure 
to answer more than half of the 
questions he raises (why did Tsing- 
ahn commit suicide? How did the 
tribe survive with insufficient gene 
pool and insufficient time to mutate 
far enough? Et many a cetera). But 
mostly it was sheer poor wordsmi- 
thing that made this book a chore to 
read. The hell of it is that it isn’t 
even consistent — at times, the prose 



seemed effortless; occasionally bril- 
liant. 

And once I made the effort, as I 
said, I found some delightful and 
fascinating ideas. But unless you 
have a tolerance-level that lets you 
read, say, “He was a normal-sized 
man, by normal man standards,” 
without flinching, you’ll never get 
to them. 

★ ★ ★ 

So there’s this tremendous New 
Wave-Old Wave controversy in sf, 
with each side bemoaning the in- 
transigent idiocies of the opposition. 
Me, I tend to bemoan the intransi- 
gent idiocies of both sides. It seems 
obvious to me that blending the 
strengths of both is the best way to 
resolve the apparent dichotomy {any 
apparent dichotomy). But Judy-Lynn 
del Rey’s Stellar #2 goes a long 
way toward converting me to pure 
Old Wavism. 1 found it much less 
ambitious than, say, the average 
Orbit — and much more fun to read. 

Call it 85% on the Spidermeter. 
One story I loathed: “Tindar-B,” 
by Patrick Conner, a slushpile job 1 
abandoned after three pages with a 
clear conscience (Xenobiologists 
land on a planet about which they 
know absolutely nothing except that 
the last survey crew died. So the 
very first thing they do upon land- 
ing is blow the hatch — not cycle an 
airlock, blow a hatch — and all take 
a deep breath at once. To see if the 
air is safe. I’m not making this up, 
nor is it meant to be a parody. 
“ ‘Seems okay,’ Byron ventured as 
he noticed his heart was still beat- 
ing. ‘So far so good, anyway.’ ” 
Not by me it isn’t.). And two 



BOOKSHELF 



143 



stories only get a half-credit apiece; 
Jay Haldeman’s “Songs of Dying 
Swans” wasn’t up to his usual 
standard of excellence, and Larry 
Niven’s “Mistake” is self-descrip- 
tive (three pages isn’t too much for 
a one-joke throwaway, but it was a 
dumb joke). 

But the rest were uniformly good, 
with particularly high marks for 
James White’s “Custom Fitting,” 
Hal Clement’s “Stuck- With It,” 
and Richard S. and Cliff D. 
Simak’s “Unsilent Spring” (al- 
though that last had a weak ending), 
and a double-bonus for “The Bicen- 
tennial Man,” one of the best 
stories Isaac Asimov has written in 
years. 

Overall a satisfying book, and 
certainly more consistent than half 
of the anthos coming out these 
days. 

, Keith Laumer’s Bolo confuses me 
some. It’s a collection of all the 
stories Keith has written involving 
Bolo Combat Units— essentially 
self-aware tanks, but with planet- 
wrecking firepower. I had read all 
of these when they originally ap- 
peared, and enjoyed them mightily. 
So re-reading them was a lit- 
tle .. painful. 

Because the first two, at least, 
now strike me as just awful, pure 
adolescent-tripe adventure, wherein 
impossibly competent heros waltz 
through Incredible difficulties with 
James Bondian cool and ridiculous 
ease. I liked ’em just fine when I 
was seventeen, but I guess I’ve just 
outgrown ’em or something: they 
now seem contrived and utterly un- 
believable (the Bolo gets only a 
walk-on in the second story, 
“Courier,” and Retief defeats it by 

144 



sticking his hat into the gun muz- 
zle). I dunno, maybe I’m just an 
old fogey. I’ve gotten quite a few 
letters from younger readers asking 
me to turn them on to some Good 
Old Adventure, and this is sure the 
pure stuff. 

And the other four stories are in- 
finitely better, wringing genuine 
pathos from the plight of a self- 
aware behemoth programmed to de- 
stroy. “The Last Command” in 
particular is a classic of tight pacing 
and suspense, with a moving end- 
ing. 

Which gives the book a bare 65% 
on the meter— and yet 1 enjoyed it a 
good deal. This seems to be my 
month for ambiguity. Perhaps I 
should go join that monastery at 
that. 

* ★ * 

When I spoke with GoH Robert 
Heinlein at MidAmeriCon, I asked 
him to autograph my paperback 
copy of The Unpleasant Profession 
of Jonathan Hoag. Now, I have lit- 
erally everything Mr. Heinlein ever 
wrote in my collection (with the ex- 
ception of his one and only collab- 
oration), some of them in hardback. 
Why did I choose this book? 

Well, it wasn’t because it con- 
tains “All You Zombies,” although 
that is one of the all-time classics 
and certainly the god-damndest 
time-travel-paradox story ever (not 
to mention the single most-imitated 
story in science fiction). Nor was it 
because Hoag contains “They, 
another genre classic and the ulti- 
mate logical extension of paranoia 
as a world-view. No, it was “Th® 
Man Who Traveled In Elephants,” 

GALAXY 



my single favorite Heinlein story of 
all time, that caused me to take this 
particular volume to Kansas City. 

Friends, I’ve read that story at 
least ten times in the twenty years 
since it first saw print, and every 
damn time I finish there are honest 
to God tears on my face, joyful, 
stinging tears. I’ve never seen that 
last sentence when it wasn’t blurry, 
and I don’t believe I ever will. I 
hope not. 

I don’t want to inflate it out of 
proportion: it’s just a short fantasy, 
more like the best of Ray Bradbury 
than most of Heinlein’s work. But it 
catches me, every time. What more 
can I tell you? 

All praise to Berkley for reissuing 
this volume (a clear 100% on the 
Spidermeter, if that needs saying), 
and I envy any of you who have yet 
to read it.

The Craft of Science Fiction de- 
serves a long and thoughtful review 
(more like half a column), but I’m 
(like one of Larry Niven’s charac- 
ters) running out of space. 

What this is, is a “symposium,” 
a collection of essays on the craft of 
sf writing by: editor Reginald Bret- 
nor, somebody named Pournelle, 
Larry Niven, James Gunn, Poul 
Anderson, Fred Pohl, Frank Her- 
bert, Alan Nourse, Norman Spin-- 
rad, John Brunner, Hal Clement, 
Jack Williamson, Katherine Mac- 
lean, and two newcomers named El- 
lison and Sturgeon (tee hee). The 
book is just a kaleidoscope of fas- 
cinating insights into this craziest of 
all professions, uniformly excellent 
throughout. I consider it a must for 

BOOKSHELF 



any serious reader, writer or (espe- 
cially) would-be writer of sf — and 
teachers of sf and sf-related courses 
will find it invaluable. 

I’m grateful to own a copy: it’s

Three different people responded 
to my hint (July 1976 .Galaxy Book- 
shelf) and mailed me copies of 
Tony Boucher’s Rocket to the 
Morgue. Of the three, one asked 
not to be identified. I’ve lost one’s 
cover letter, and the third, Lisa 
Goldstein of Dark Carnival Fantasy 
& SF Bookstore, 2812-14 Telegraph 
Ave., Berkeley CA 94705, was 
forced to admit that “unfortunately, 
this is not the place to get Rocket 
to the Morgue as I am sending you 
our last copy.” Oh well. 

I urge the rest of you to hunt for 
it: a fine tight murder mystery by a 
late Great, with some delightful 
surprises and a locked-room 
murder — plus the added pleasure of 
an insider’s view of sf pro-and- 
fandom of the 1940s, in which sub- 
culture Tony set his story. 

Spotting the Old Pros in their thin 
disguises is of course part of the 
fun — but even if you don’t happen 
to know any pro well enough to 
spot them in Macy’s window, you’ll 
enjoy Rocket. Thanks, Lisa — and if 
the person whose letter I lost will 
write again. I’ll be happy to return 
your copy, or pass it on to a good 
friend, or whatever stones ya. 

My Name Is Legion is not about 
Liz Taylor’s husbands. It’s a collec- 
tion of those Roger Zelazny stories

about the really-secret agent who 
doesn’t appear in the World Data 
Banks (which he helped compile) 
and is therefore effectively invisi- 
ble. Every year he sends one un- 
signed Christmas card to the head 
of the world’s second-largest detec- 
tive agency, listing four dates dur- 
ing the next year and the bars he’ll 
be in on those dates. Remember 
now? In these three novellae, 
Roger’s hero takes on underwater 
earthquakes (“The Eve of 
RUMOKO’’), killer dolphins 
(“KjwalU’kje’k’koo-thai’lU’kje’k’’) 
(honest to God), and a berserk robot 
(“Home Is The Hangman,’’ which 
just won a Hugo in spite of the fact 
that Roger forgot to explain, both 
here and in the original magazine 
publication, why the hell the robot 
was called The Hangman). A 
pretty good book, of the “think- 
ing man’s adventure” school.

I’ve been saving Nerves for last. 
If you haven’t read this book yet, 
you’re a lucky soul: rereading it for 
review was the most fun I’ve had 
all month. Don’t be dismayed by 
the new cover (which looks like 
David Steinberg, with his face on 
crooked, being attacked by lime 
jello) — this is one of the acknowl- 
edged classics of the field, and a 
textbook example of how to build 
suspense to the breaking point. 
Newly revised and updated, it is 
perhaps the first and certainly the 
finest of the disaster novels, prob- 
ably Lester del Rey’s finest work to 
date (and when, oh when will there 
be a new del Rey book?). Crisis in 
the atom plant, building at mea-

sured pace from a murmur to a sus- 
tained shriek, and seen through the 
eyes of a character I feel like I’ve 
known all my life: go get it. Some 
of the science is nOw outdated 
. or is it? See Lester’s delight- 
ful afterword.

A last-minute plug, for those of 
you who are Callahan’s Place fans: 
Callahan’s Crosstime Saloon will 
not be a Tempo paperback after all. 
Ace bought Tempo, along with the 
rest of Grosset & Dunlap, and so 
Saloon will be an Ace paperback. 
And as near as 1 can outguess the 
time-lag (between the time I write 
this and the time you read it), it 
ought to be on the stands either 
right now or any day now. If you’re 
not familiar with Callahan’s Place, I 
humbly suggest you check it out: 
some of my best short stories are in 
that book (for those of you who are 
familiar with the series, the collec- 
tion will contain three stories avail- 
able nowhere else). And why 
haven’t you bought my first novel 
Telempath yet (available in 
hardcover from Berkley/Putnam)? 
It’s been out since December — 
whassamatta, you don’t like your- 
self or somethin’? 

Oh, and I’ve decided not to enter 
that monastery after all. Not only 
did I meet with vigorous objection 
from my wife and daughter (not to 
mention my creditors), Dick Geis 
threatened legal action. He claims 
there’s only room for one altar-ego 
in this magazine (even God is not a 
constant any more: they’ve changed 
His mass).

A

was 



lucky 



very 



man 





Oarry davenport had been hear- 
ing people talk about controllers 
ever since the day the first control- 
ler had been planted in the skuU of 
an anonymous convict in a state 
prison in California. People had 
argued about controllers at half the 
parties he had attended during the 
last two years and he had even 
started a couple of arguments him- 
self before he had realized he would 
be better off if he headed for a quiet 
comer every time the subject came 
up. His wife and all her friends 
were convinced every male in the 
United States should be given a 
complete battery of psych tests at 
the age of twenty-one and fitted 
with a controller if he needed one, 
and they started crusading for their 
great project every time a beserker 
stuck a knife in somebody or some 
idiot managed to throw something 
lethal at a politician. 

He had never actually seen a con- 
troller, however, and no one had 
ever had to tell him there was a big 
difference between a tangible reality 
and a topic you argued about at par- 
ties. They had basn talking about 
the damned thing for at least thirty 
minutes now, but he still stiffened 
when the psychologist took it out of 
a drawer and laid it on his console. 

“You can pick it up if you want 
to,” Dr. Lazarre said. “Sometimes 
it’s a lot easier to think about some- 
thing like this once you’ve actually 
touched the thing and looked at it 
close enough to read its brand 
name.” 

Harry stared at the little plastic 
box through a haze. The shiny ob- 
ject inside it was a little smaller 
than the marbles he had played with 
when he had been a kid. TTie three 



micro-thin filaments coiled on one 
side were almost invisible. 

“They tried to design it so it 
would be as unobtrusive as possi- 
ble,” Dr. Lazarro said. “Most of 
the peqjle who’ve used them so far 
claim they never even notice they’re 
wearing it. It has to be implanted 
under the skin by a surgeon, but all 
it needs after that is a quarterly 
maintenance checkup and a bi- 
monthly ten minute visit to have the 
reservoir refilled. It’s completely 
automatic and it usually reacts so 
fast the person who’s wearing it 
doesn’t even know he’s started to 
lose his temper. The surgeon places 
it so it deposits the drug on the 
brain cells that react the fastest and 
the brain waves that trigger off the 
monitor have a unique configura- 
tion. It can react the instant it picks 
up the right type of brain wave, 
without waiting for it to build up. 
You may be aware something has 
happened that would normally have 
made you lose your temper, but 
normally you won’t even feel an in- 
crease in your blood pressure. The 
brainwaves start changing long be- 
fore the rest of the body can react.” 
Harry stared at the box without 
picking it up. His brain had stopped 
functioning thirty minutes ago but 
his emotions would have been 
screaming with panic if the bastards 
had tied him down and loaded his 
system with a drug that reduced his 
IQ by fifty percent. He was a 
mathematician himself and he had 
understood the situation as soon as 
Lazarro had told him the results of 
his tests. He worked with 
mathematical models that could 
predict minor fluctuations in the 
North American economy and 



148 



GALAXY 



Lazarro worked with mathematical 
models that could predict the ac- 
tions of any individual who would 
submit to his tests. Individuals 
could still make mistakes, but 
Lazarro had checked his work with 
three other psychologists and no- 
body outside his field could chal- 
lenge his results. If Lazarro’s com- 
puter said Harry Davenport was 
going to go beserk and kill some- 
body in the near future, then Harry 
Davenport was going to kill some- 
body if somebody didn’t put him 
out of action first. 

“That still doesn’t make it an 
easy reality to accept, of course,” 
Lazarro said. “It’s still a terrible 
thing to ask anybody. Most people 
feel personally insulted when its men- 
tioned to them, and I don’t blame 
them. We’ve done everything we can 
to make it as innocuous as possible, 
but it’s still a terrible blow to any 
normal man’s self-esteem. We’re 
living in a culture in which that 
kind of external control is asso- 
ciated with weakness or with a loss 
of freedom and nobody who lives 
in a culture like that can adjust to 
this kind of change overnight.” 

Harry sat back in his chair and 
crossed his legs. He was a wrin- 
kled, middle-aged man who had been 
a leader in his profession for over 
fifteen years, and he had always 
been proud of the fact that he could 
maintain an urbane front under al- 
most any conditions. The people he 
worked with were just as quirky as 
any group of people he had ever 
met, but he usually managed to 
keep his emotions under control and 
avoid the impulsive reactions that 
could turn minor situations into full 
scale emergencies. 



“I’m afraid it’s pretty damned 
hard to believe, too. This is the first 
time in my life I’ve ever done any- 
thing that could even be considered 
violent. I wouldn’t even watch box- 
ing matches with my father when I 
was a kid.” 

Lazarro waved his hand over the 
printout on his console. He was the 
senior psychologist in the clinic but 
he was about ten years younger than 
his client, and his crisp clones and 
carefully molded hair made him 
look like an advertising man’s pic- 
ture of the successful young man 
who dashed out of the office at the 
end of the day and spent the eve- 
ning running around the city with 
the best looking girls in the area. 

“That’s one of the main reasons 
it’s always such a shock,” Lazarro 
said. “A person with this type of 
personality can go along for years 
and years without hurting anyone 
and then he can ruin his whole life 
in an instant. There even seems to 
be a strong association between this 
trait and a couple of traits most of 
us consider desirable. Most of the 
people who have this problem seem 
to have a strong sense of responsi- 
bility to society and an above- 
average capacity to get along with 
people. We’ve never been able to 
spot the people who lead normal 
lives and then blow up without 
warning before now, and the results 
are usually a shock to everybody.” 

“And tfiis is all you can do? This 
is the only treatment you’ve come 
up with?” 

“It’s the only treatment we’ve 
come up with anylxxiy can recom- 
mend. The only alternative would 
be a re-shaping of your personality 
that would be so basic and so ex- 



THE CHAINS OF FREEDOM 



149 



tensive you’d probably resist it even 
more than most people resist this — 
and the techniques for re-shaping 
personalities are so primitive you’d 
have no guarantee you wouldn’t be 
a complete emotional cripple when 
you got finished. Some people blow 
up because they’re repressing very 
strong grievances, and we can help 
them bring their anger up to the sur- 
face and teach them how to control 
it. But with a small number of 
people you’re dealing with some- 
thing that seems to be inherent in 
the structure of their personality. 1 
can give you more information 
about personality re-shaping if you 
want it, but 1 can practically guaran- 
tee you’ll think this is a better op- 
tion.” 

Harry’s hands tightened on the 
arms of his chair. He lowered his 
head* and stared at the thing on the 
console as if he were thinking about 
a decision in front of a subordinate. 

‘‘We’ll give you all the support 
we can give you if you agree to do 
this,” Lazarro said. ‘‘We’ll try to 
make it as easy as possible.” 

There was no way he could keep 
Ellen from knowing they had done 
this to him. He would stand in front 
of his wife arid son with that thing 
in his skull and they would both 
know it was there. Everybody they 
knew would hear about it sooner or 
later. 

* * * 

Daddy couldn’t help it when he 
hit you, Danny. He has a sickness 
that made him hit you but Mommy 
made him go to the doctor and 
they’ve given him a little machine 
that gives him some medicine when 

150 



he starts losing his temper. Some 
people have emotions they can’t 
control — you may even have them 
yourself — but we’re living in a 
wonderful world where people are 
beginning to understand themselves 
better and learn how to control 
these things. 

I always knew there was some- 
thing wrong with him. Remember 
how he used to get hot every time 
we talked about controllers? These 
calm, stable types are all alike. 
They try to look like they’re made 
out of rock but they’re always boil- 
ing like cauldrons when you open 
them up and get a look at their real 
feelings. 

You hate him and you hate me 
Harry. You’ve spent all your life 
talking to computers instead of 
people and now it’s catching up 
with you. You’ve been hiding your 
feelings about other people behind 
that Goddamned mask you wear 
and now all that rage you’ve never 
learned to deal with has finally 
come out. I don’t want to make 
threats, Harry, but Tm not going to 
let you go on living with that poor 
boy if you don’t get some profes- 
sional help. You could have broken 
his neck if you’d hit him any harder 
and the things you’ve done to his 
emotional development are probably 
just as bad. There isn’t a court in 
the country that will let you keep 
custody of that poor child after 
this. 

‘‘We’re asking you to do this to 
protect others as well as yourself. 
Dr. Davenport. The least we can do 
in return is to use the resources we 
have here to make it as easy for you 
as possible.” 

‘‘So you can help me reduce the 
GALAXY 



damage to my self-esteem?” 

‘‘Some of the things that make 
this repulsive are inherent ii> the 
basic idea. There isn’t anything 
anybody can do about them and 
there isn’t any point in pretending 
there is. But sometimes some of the 
things that make it painful can be 
handled pretty easily if somebody 
will just take a little trouble. A lot 
of people are afraid of the way their 
families may react, for example. 
Sometimes a good talk with the 
family can make the whole thing a 
lot easier to take.” 

Harry’s body tensed. His hands 
clutched the arms of his chair as if 
he were sitting in a car that was 
speeding toward a collision. 

‘‘1 don’t know how you feej 
about your son, for example, but 
there are things we can tell him that 
will make it easier on you and that 
will still give him some assurance 
you didn’t hate him when you hit 
him — and that will let him know his 
father is still a man he can respect, 
too. They’re hard problems to han- 
dle by yourself but we can give you 
expert advice. We’ve got films we 
can show him and we can work out 
programmed sessions for your 
whole family that are almost 
guaranteed to make the whole thing 
much more tolerable. The fact that 
your wife’s had some experience in 
psychotherapy may help, too. 
People still think about this the way 
they thought about ordinary mental 
illness at the beginning of the cen- 
tury. A wife with the right kind of 
attitude can make it a lot easier to 
face the rest of the world and — ” 
Harry’s fists clenched. He pushed 
himself out of the chair and Lazarro 
tensed. 



He looked down at the well-dres- 
sed, self-confident young man sit- 
ting in fi-ont of him. Lazarro’s right 
hand moved toward a keyboard on 
the righthand side of the console. 

Harry’s fist rose above his shoul- 
der. Rage twisted his face. His fist 
swung toward the psychologist’s 
head like a rock on the end of a 
rope. 

Lazarro punched a button on his 
keyboard and kicked his chair away 
from the console. A cloud of white 
gas blossomed out of a nozzle built 
into the console. 

Spring breezes played around 
Harry Davenport’s head. He sucked 
in a big lungfull of gas and his 
muscles relaxed. Warm, pleasant 
sensations spread through his body. 

He pulled in another lungfull. He 
knew they had designed the gas so 
every breath would make him want 
more, but he was just as vulnerable 
as every other human being who 
had ever breathed it. 

He slumped into the chair. The 
cloud drifted toward him and he 
sucked in more gas. 

Lazarro eased himself out of the 
swivel chair. He stepped up to the 
console and studied his patient. 

‘‘Are you all right. Dr. Daven- 
port? Does your head hurt?” 

Harry stared at him out of the 
haze. The quick-acting tranquilizer 
had started wearing off already. His 
body still felt warm and heavy but 
he was already beginning to react to 
the situation again. 

His fists clenched again. He 
started to stand up and then fell 
back. 

‘‘You goaded me into doing 
that,” Harry said. ‘‘You pushed every 
Goddamned button you could.” 



THE CHAINS OF FREEDOM

“I didn’t know you’d react that 
way. I was trying to bring out the 
things that may be bothering you 
but I didn’t know you’d react that 
way. I’ve got a good idea what they 
are but I wouldn’t have mentioned 
them if I’d known you’d react that 
way.” 

“You don’t know the things 
that’ll trigger it off? You’ve got me 
all mapped out on your Goddamned 
diagrams and you don’t know when 
I’ll do it?” 

“I should have realized. We’re 
putting you under a tremendous 
stress; hif the people in this city 
would blow up if somebody put 
them in the kind of dilemma you’re 
in. I miscalculated the impact I was 
going to have, but I wasn’t trying to 
make you blow up. It’s happened 
twice now already. Dr. Davenport, 
and you’ve been lucky both times. 
You’re caught in a trap and this is 
the only way we can set you free. 
It’s a rotten deal to hand anybody, 
but if it’s your relationship with 
your wife that’s bothering you, why 
don’t you at least give me a chance 
to talk about it with you? There are 
things we can do nowadays that can 
make this whole business a hundred 
percent easier. We spend more time 
with the families of our clients 
nowadays than we do with the 
clients themselves.” 

“There isn’t one Goddamned 
thing you can do with that woman! 
You don’t know the kind of person 
you’re dealing with! She’s been 
going to encounter groups and 
human relations clinics ever since 
she was a Goddamned teenager and 
the only thing they’ve ever taught 
her is the best place to poke people 
where it hurts!” 



“We can set up specially pro- 
grammed sessions for her. We can 
introduce her to encounter groups 
and experiences that can break 
down the defenses of people who’ve 
practically made a career out of 
going to encounter groups. We can 
even offer her the kind of full-scale 
self-analysis every psychologist 
has to go through to get his license 
to practice.” 

“You aren’t going to change her 
damned behavior by helping her 
understand herself! You don’t know 
. the kind of person you’re dealing 
with!” 

“You think she’d make this dif-! 
ficult for you even if she understood 
her motives?’ ’ 

“You don’t know the kind of 
person you’re dealing with! You’re 
giving her the biggest Goddamned 
present she’s ever had! She’s going 
to enjoy every damned moment of 
it!” 

Lazarro glanced at the clock on 
his console. It was two thirty in the 
afternoon and he had left the rest of 
the day free. 

They had passed the big barrier 
charted on the printout. He had 
been afraid it would take all day 
and it had taken less than fifty min- 
utes instead. The next few hours 
were going to be some of the worst 
hours Davenport would ever live 
through, but the end of the af- 
ternoon was as predictable as the 
orbit of a spaceship. A man like 
Davenport could adjust to anything 
once he got it out in the open and 
started talking about it. 

“You think she’s going to enjoy 
this. Dr. Davenport?” Lazarro said. 
“You think she wants you to put up 
with something like this?” ★

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Bravo! and congratulations on your edito- 
rial “Epistle to the Christians”. I concur to- 
tally. It was a brilliant interpretation; 1 only 
wish more people could share these beliefs, 
or at least see them as a possible viewpoint. 
If we could only reset our priorities enough 
to get funds for those things which are 
technologically feasible, we would take a 
giant leap forward, with the momentum car- 
rying us on indefinitely. But you didn't dis- 
cuss just how far we should carry this 
“dominion” stuff. 

Jerry Poumelle, as usual, had an excellent 
column “That Buck Rogers Stuff” in/4 Step 
Farther Out. However, I don’t agree with 
soijie of your methods. We had better avoid 
atomic drives, especially fission, when close 
to inhabited planets. Of course there’s more 
than One Earth, but let’s be especially care- 
ful with this one! 

Larry Niven’s “Children of the State” and 
Fredrick Pohl’s “Gateway” are both Out- 
A-Sight, and all your shorts are acceptable if 
not truly excellent. Keep up the good work, 
GALAXY! 

Faithfully yours,

Certainly wc should avoid significant 
radioactive contamination of Earth's atmos- 
phere. Perhaps the best "thrust mix” would 

154 



be a combination of chemical reaction drives 
for personnel and laser launching for mate- 
rial, when launching from Earth, combined 
with atomics for Lunar and cis-Lunar ac- 
tivities. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

During a Christmas season filled with the 
efforts of Science Fiction and Fantasy writers 
to incorporate their specialties into the Nativ- 
ity, I found you editorial “Epistle to the 
Christians” a refreshingly intelligent ap- 
proach. 

I feel that you may receive verbal fire 
from fundamentalists. Perhaps the following 
quotes from American astronauts may add to 
the validity of your conclusion: 

“Once a man flies in space, he may never 
be the same ...” 

Edgar D. Mitchell 
Apollo 14 Lunar Module Pilot 

“My space flight experience changed my 
entire view of reality on Earth . gave me 
a profound feeling of rejuvenation.” 

Col. Alfred M. Worden 
Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot 

“The whole process begins to shift what it 
is you identify with. From where you see it, 
the Earth is a whole, and it’s so beautiful. 
And you realize that you’ve changed 
. something about your relationship 
with this thing we call life. It’s different and 
it’s precious.” 

Russell L. Schweickort 
Apollo 9 Lunar Module Pilot 

“. however you look at it, the observa- 
tion is humbling because the tenuousness of 
our existence is emphasized by the need for 
man to get into harmony with his environ- 
ment and with his fellow man.” 

Col. Gerald P. Carr 
Skylab 4 Commander 

If in fact the vision of Revelation is to- 
ward the stars, then the first impressions of 
the astronauts that man in space will see 
himself as Man may justify that vision.

Thank you again for a most thought- 
provoking editorial.

Thank you. So far response to that edito- 
rial has been astonishingly suppor- 
tive .... Frankly I had thought I was being 
rather more daringly controversial than 
would seem to have been the case. Looks 
like the readers are way ahead of me! 



Dear Jim, 

As you’ll recall we had a blood donation 
drive at the Kansas City world SF conven- 
tion. As a result of Robert Heinlein’s efforts, 
more and more science fiction clubs and 
convention committees are now interested in 
blood donation and recruiting donors. 

Robert’s idea is that most lodges and clubs 
are associated with a “favorite charity”: the 
Shriners with crippled children, that kind of 
thing, and that the science fiction community 
is now sufficiently mature that we ought 
seriously to give some thought to adopting 
our own. He suggests that encouraging vol- 
untary blood donations would be appropriate 
for us — and he’s right. Not only is the cause 
championed by our first Grand Master, but it 
is an organ-transplant technology; something 
which is both technological and needed. 

In fact, the records show that science fic- 
tion fans and writers already donate blood at 
well over twice the national average rate, so 
we’ve made a fair start. With the highly suc- 
cessful blood drives at the 1976 Westercon 
and Worldcon, the continuing efforts at re- 
cent regional conventions, and Mr. Hein- 
lein’s encouragement, we seem well on the 
way to ,a tradition — one that I hope will 
catch on. I hate needles, but as the first one 
through the line at the Westercon I can as- 
sure everyone that it’s at worst unpleasant— 
and that’s a small price. 

Jerry Poumelle 



To the Chief Panda: 

Having finally read Stephen Hawkins’ ar- 
ticle on black holes, I believe I’ve found an 
error! I can see how pair formation would 
cancel rotation, and any electrical or magne- 
tic charge. (Remember monopoles?) But I 
cannot see how this can result in loss of 
mass, as even antiparticles have positive 
mass. Now that I’ve said that. I’d like to set 
up for ray gun practice all those physicists 
who say relativity breaks down in the singu- 
larity. Just because they can’t conceive of in- 
finite forces at a point doesn’t mean the uni- 
verse had to respect this handicap! 

Brett Bellmore 

9750 Burt Road 
Capac, MI 48014 

/ believe the physicists regard the concept 
of irfinite-forces-at-a-point not so much as 
inconceivable as self contradictory — and thus 
paradoxical. Now a paradox can be used to

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I greatly enjoyed your editorial in the De- 
cember Galaxy. This agrees with my own 
personal philosophy, as did the remarks 
made by Dr. Poumelle in “A Step Farther 
Out.” 

I have enjoyed almost every story to be 
printed. in Galaxy during the two years I 
have subscribed to it. Particularly I enjoyed 
Sign of the Unicorn, The Hand of Oberon, 
and Inferno. I hope that you will continue to 
print such epic SF and fantasy. I also hope 
that you will continue to print important sci- 
ence fact such as Dr. Poumelle’s interesting 
articles and Poul Anderson’s “Our Many 
Roads to the Stars.” 

Finally, 1 enjoy Geis’s dialogs and 
Spider’s attacks on the Hax of Terra. I hope 
that these features will survive for a long 
time and that Geis never wins his 10th Hugo

Dear Ben Baen: 

I had my last final exam today so when I 
felt like staying up late rather than sleeping I 
needed something to do. What 1 ended up 
doing is rereading all of Spider’s columns for 
the last eight months or so. This tells me that 
they are very good reading. Therefore, along 
the line of readers demands to editors I 
would suggest that you at least triple the 
amount of book reviewing wordage you ask 
him for (pay him more too). This brings up 
the problem of where Spider is going to find 
the time to write his own stuff if he is con- 
stantly reading and reviewing. I have an an- 
swer. It is I don’t know. That’s his problem. 
1 am just making an (unreasonable?) de- 
mand. But I will say qualitywise that 1 never 
reread his short stories (sorry, 1 only find 
them good, not very good or great like his 
reviews). 

There, 1 am done. 1 hope you are planning 
to publish the fifth Amber book (The Courts 
of Chaos) when Zelazny finishes it. Also let 
Fteff do the illustrations (three covers would 
be about right). 

By the way, 1 voted for neither Geis or 
Alte^ because 1 think they are best together 
and that wasn’t on the ballot. 1 demand a re- 
vote with a fair ballot. 

Thank you very much for whatever, 

Rudolph G. Kraft, 111

Ben? 



One for Spider: 

Dear Spider, 

This is the second letter I’ve written you. 
That frightens me somewhat. I am the 
letter-writing type, but 1 usually manage to 

156 



restrain myself when it comes to the likes of 
book reviewers and editors. I’m not much of 
an activist, I guess. A long preamble to 
thank you for stirring me to action. 

The mail that takes this letter out will take 
another to SUNCON (or whatever the hell 
that thing is called) asking about voting 
rights and such. Score one for your column. 
It is a little chafing to think that 600 people 
pick the Hugos and less than that pick the 
Nebulae. 

Again thanks. I get tired of my own 
apathy, but it’s such an easy habit. But that’s 
not what I came to tell you. 

What it’s all about really is I wanted to 
keep stroking your ego for the beautiful job 
you’re doing in Galaxy. As book colunms 
go, I figure you’re in a tie with Lester Del 
Rey for knowledgability (knowledge -I- abil- 
ity) and slightly ahead for practicality. You 
tell me things 1 really would like to know 
about the books. I don’t always agree, but 
then you’ve never written a column wherein 
you implied that I had to. For that, undying 
gratitude. 

Lest this too-long letter turn overly 
mooshy. I’d like to point out that Epoch 
wasn’t a complete bust. It had a story by 
Lafferty. Seriously-er, I thought Bishop’s 
“Blooded on Arachne’’ was a very remarka- 
ble story, if only because it had a plot 
(something he seemed to view as a minor 
vice) to go with the pretty words. How come 
there were ads in the SF Book Club for an 
Epoch with Ellison’s “Demon with the 
Glass Hand” and then zilch? That’s really a 
rhetorical question, I guess, bom out of fms- 
tration. 

Keep on doing whatever the hell it is 
you’re doing right. Science fiction and the 
people involved in it seem hell bent on tak- 
ing themselves more and more seriously. “If 
this goes on” it will soon become the most 
pretentious genre there is. We need all the 
goofs who are just whacky enough to review 
the books that are on those funky wire racks 
in the grocery store along with the good 
stuff. Keep us honest, man. Somebody has 
to. 

Sincerely, 
Ron Nance

And in a more jugular vein , . 

My dear sir — 

In regard to your column for the Sep- 
tember issue of Galaxy: I wish you “was” a 
critic, too; for in that case, there at least 
might be an improvement in your grammar. 
To expect your column to be a duplication of 
the best of F.R. Leavis or Lionel Trilling or 
T.S. Eliot would be fairly unrealistic. But, in 
order to legitimate [sic] science-fiction’s 
claim to the attention of the intelligent 
reader, your column should (one might hope) 
evince — if not a knowledge of the literary 
tradition — at least some notion of what (in a 
fleeting moment of naive optimism) might be 
called “good writing.” 

Is this asking too much? 

Chris Schneider 

The Spider replies: 

Dear Chris, 

Yes: the “intelligent reader” doesn’t need 
to have sf “legitimated” (legitimized?) by 
pomposity. 1 have found that anything that 
cannot be stated informally is likely to be 
hogwash, and when I’m among friends I like 
to take off my necktie and scartch where it 
itches. 

Them as is offended are welcome to seek 
the egress. Hope you hang around, though. 

Spider 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

As a new addict of Galaxy, I wanted to 
let you know 1 really enjoy your magazine. 
Also, to my surprise, I find myself interested 
enough to actually write! 

First I’d like to put a vote in for Alter-Ego 
and Mr. Geis to continue to write a joint 
column as they have been. Second to Spider 
Robinson, I am one of those “bookshelf 
only” SF fans, (not any more) However I 
disagree with him on one point. My chances 
of choosing a good book from an SF shelf 
are about 8 out of 10, if I can find any that I 
feel are worth reading or that I haven’t al-

ready read. (8 years of experience sure help) 
My chances on straight fiction are about 2 
out of 10. 

Next 1 had a small objection to the letter 
of Thomas J. Murn, in the October ’76 
Galaxy. Do you usually print letters from 
bigots?! Until I read Mr. Mum’s letter, I 
wasn’t sure what Dhalgren was about. In 
spite of the fact it was verbose 1 didn’t like 
it, BUT I make no judgments that it is poor 
SF. I know a few people who did or would 
like it. Does Mr. Mum read “Doc” Smith? 

Lastly, the proportion of serials to col- 
umns to stories, etc. in the 'October ’76 issue 
was perfect. Keep up the good work!

/ think what you are getting at is not that 
80% of randomly selected s/ books are worth 
reading, but that you have exceptionally well 
developed “reader antennae’’ and so can 
score 80% of the time. Not bad! 

Dear Jim, 

I am not a Science Fiction Writer. I am 
not even a wildly participating Science Fic- 
tion “Fan”. I am, however, a thoroughly en- 
tranced, though, for the most part generally 
fmstrated, middle-aged, female Braille reader 
of Science Fiction. 

I have to agree with the blind people who 
have communicated with Spider Robinson 
about this. Galaxy stands out as a highlight 
in my monthly reading Schedule. I have en- 
joyed “Galaxy Bookshelf’ for years, first 
under Algys Budys’s able guidance, and then 
with Ted Sturgeon manning the helm. I en- 
joyed them both and was envious of ev- 
erybody who could sit down and devour all 
those goodies. 

Now Spider’s a whole other kind of cat. I 
feel that he almost literally feels himself to 
be an extension of his typewriter when writ- 
ing his column, and I dig that! I also feel he 
functions on a level of high integrity seldom 
encountered by anyone outside the pages of 
SF. 

I have seldom been so intrigued by any- 

158 



thing as I was by the October issue of 
Galaxy, which contains Jack Williamson’s 
article, “Designing a Dyson Sphere”, and 
Fred Pohl’s superb first half of “Gateway”. 
What a fascinating premise!. 

Though I read the magazine through the 
day after 1 got it,’ I’m saving it so that I can 
reread the first half of Gateway in conjunc- 
tion with the second half. 

Jim. your editorial skill is abundant, and 
you use it well and consistently. Keep up the 
good work. 

Gratefully, 
(Mrs.) Anne Darche 

/ have recently learned that over 10% of 
Galaxy’s “readers” are sightless, or nearly 
so. I also learned — long ago~-that among 
Galaxy’s sighted readers are some of the 
most warmly enthusiastic and giving people 
in the world. It strikes me that this is a set- 
up: / propose that Galaxy act as a clearing- 
house between people who would like to pro- 
vide science-fiction oriented services for the 
sightless and those who would like to receive 
such services. 

The services might include escorting at 
conventions and to fan club meetings; read- 
ing, either “live” or via cassette; helping to 
organize (this would probably only be feasi- 
ble in large cities) fan clubs for the visually 
impaired, together with a sighted “auxil- 
liary” to provide reading, escort and what- 
ever. Authors could provide a very special 
service by arranging with their publishers for 
permission to do multiple cassette recordings 
of their works for non-profit distribution. Fi- 
nally, someone must assume the "clearing- 
house role: Galaxy will only be able to 
carry the burden for a limited time. 
Perhaps some fan club would like to offer its 
services for this? 

Those interested in being put in touch with 
volunteers should wait at least a month be- 
fore making inquiries. Those wishing to vol- 
unteer should write immediately to:
