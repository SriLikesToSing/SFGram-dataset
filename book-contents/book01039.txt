OF TWO MINDS 



j^TOST of the greatest contri- 
butions and biggest messes 
have been made by two kinds of 
brains — the devious and the lit- 
eral. Those of us who fall be- 
tween these extremes are gener- 
ally awed by the first and dis- 
mayed by the second. 

When I was writing fact-de- 
tective cases, I was impressed by 
the beautifully elaborate plans 
of a Chicago man who murdered 
his wife with all the brilliance of 
a chess master. But then I dis- 
covered why the police prefer in- 
genious crimes; with so many 
threads to hold, the complex crim- 
inal is bound to tangle himself up 
quickly. 

The devious slayer was caught 
in less than a day! 

But deviousness is almost al- 
ways a joy to watch. Not long 
ago. The New Yorker ran a piece 
by a writer who lacked repartee 
and thus was reduced to prepar- 
tee — setting up his gags in ad- 
vance. Living in the country, 
where power and phone lines top- 
ple in every storm, he saw a great 
possibility: 

It the power lines went down 
and the telephone wires didn’t 
and he made a call to a neighbor 
and the wife answered instead oi 
the husband, he’d have a perfect 
setup. 



That was a lot to ask, but it 
happened. He grabbed the phone, 
called, the wife answered, and he 
crowed, “Where was Moses when 
the light went out?” Mrs. Moses 
said, “Down in the cellar. He 
thought it was the fuse.” The 
writer said, “Oh,” and made some 
small talk about the storm, and 
disappointedly hung up. 

Naturally, he had to tell some- 
body, so he explained the joke to 
his wife, who listened stonily. 
“Well, it was a funny idea, wasn’t 
it?” he demanded peevishly. “Fun- 
ny,” she said. “Don’t make me 
laugh.” 

She, incidentally, once reported 
that a friend of hers “goes to 
church religiously.” 

With a wife like that, I sup- 
pose a man has no recourse but 
Erector Set thinking. Unfortu- 
nately, he just proves the cops 
are right — the more complicated 
reasoning gets, the more likely it 
is to fall apart. 

Yet there’s no doubt that we 
need devious minds. During WW 
II, some genius hired science fic- 
tion writers to think up out- 
landish weapons and engineers to 
detail them — and then let the 
blueprints fall into enemy hands, 
thus lousing up their research. 

On the other hand, when Mac-

Volpla 

By WYMAN GUIN 

The only kind of gag worth pulling, f alway$ 
ntaintained, was a cosmic one — till f learned 
the Cosmos has a really nasty sense of humorl 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



T here were three of 

them. Dozens of limp lit- 
tle mutants that would 
have sent an academic zoologist 
into hysterics lay there in the 
metabolic accelerator. But there 
were three of them. My heart 
took a great bound. 

I heard my daughter’s running 
feet in the animal rooms and her 
rollerskates banging at her side. 



I closed the accelerator and walk- 
ed across to the laboratory door. 
She twisted the knob violently, 
trying to hit a combination that 
would work. 

I unlocked the door, held it 
against her pushing and slipped 
out so that, for all her peering, she 
could see nothing. I looked down 
on her tolerantly. 

“Can’t adjust your skates?” I 
asked again. 

“Daddy, I’ve tried and tried 
and I just can’t turn this old key 
tight enough.” 

I continued to look down on 
her. 

“Well, Dad-dee, I can’t!” 

“Tightly enough.” 

“What?” 

“You can’t turn this old key 
tightly enough.” 

“That’s what I say-yud.” 

“All right, wench. Sit on this 
chair.” 

I got down and shoved one sad- 
dle shoe into a skate. It fitted per- 
fectly. I strapped her ankle and 
pretended to use the key to tight- 
en the clamp. 

Volplas at last Three of them. 
Yet I had always been so sure I 
could create them that I had been 
calling them volplas for ten years. 
No, twelve.' I glanced across the 
animal room to where old Nijin- 
sky thrust his graying head from 
a cage. I had called them volplas 
since the day old Nijinsky’s elon- 
gated arms and his cousin’s lat- 



eral skin folds had given me the 
idea of a flying mutant. 

TTT-HEN NIJINSKY saw me 
looking at him, he started a 
little tarantella about his cage. 
I smiled with nostalgia when the 
fifth fingers of his hands, four 
times as long as the others, un- 
curled as he spun about the cage. 

I turned to the fitting of my 
daughter’s other skate. 

“Daddy?” 

“Yes?” 

“Mother says you are eccentric. 
Is that true?” 

“I’ll speak to her about it.” 
“Don’t you know?” 

“Do you understand the word^” 
“No.” 

I lifted her out of the chair and 
stood her on her skates. “Tell 
your mother that I retaliate. I 
say she is beautiful.” 

She skated awkwardly between 
the rows of cages from which mu- 
tants with brown fur and blue fur, 
too much and too little fur, enor- 
mously long and ridiculously 
short arms, stared at her with 
simian, canine or rodent faces. At 
the door to the outside, she turned 
perilously and waved. 

Again in the laboratory, I en- 
tered the metabolic accelerator 
and withdrew the intravenous 
needles from my first volplas. I 
carried their limp little forms out 
to a mattress in the lab, two girls 
and a boy. The accelerator had 



forced them almost to adulthood 
in less than a month. It would be 
several hours before they would 
begin to move, to learn to feed 
and play, perhaps to learn to fly. 

Meanwhile, it was clear that 
here was no war of dominant mu- 
tations. Modulating alleles had 
smoothed the freakish into a 
beautiful pattern. These were no 
monsters blasted by the dosage of 
radiation into crippled structures. 
They were lovely, perfect little 
creatures. 

My wife tried the door, too, but 
more subtly, as if casually touch- 
ing the knob while calling. 

“Lunch, dear.” 

“Be right there.” 

She peeked too, as she had for 
fifteen years, but I blocked her 
view when I slipped out. 

“Come ori, you old hermit. I 
have a buffet on the terrace.” 

“Our daughter says I’m eccen- 
tric. Wonder how the devil she 
found out.” 

“From me, of course.” 

“But you love me just the 
same.” 

“I adore you.” She stretched on 
tiptoe and put her arms over my 
shoulders and kissed me. 

My wife did indeed have a 
delicious-looking buffet ready on 
the terrace. The maid was just 
setting down a warmer filled with 
hot hamburgers. I gave the maid 
a pinch and said, “Hello, baby.” 

My wife looked at me with a 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



puzzled smile. “What on Earth’s 
got into you?” 

The maid beat it into the house. 
I flipped a hamburger and a 
slice of onion onto a plate and 
picked up the ketchup and said, 
“I’ve reached the dangerous age.” 
“Oh, good heavens!” 

1 DOWSED ketchup over the 
hamburger, threw the onion 
on and closed it. I opened a bottle 
of beer and guzzled from it, blew 
out my breath and looked across 
the rolling hills and oak woods 
of our ranch to where the Pacific 
shimmered. I thought, “All this 
and three volplas, too.” 

I wiped the back of my hand 
across my mouth and said aloud, 
“Yes, sir, the dangerous age. And, 
lady, I’m going to have fun.” 

My wife sighed patiently. 

I walked over and put the arm 
that held the beer bottle around 
her shoulder and chucked her 
chin up with my other hand. The 
golden sun danced in her blue 
eyes. I watched that light in her 
beautiful eyes and said, “But 
you’re the only one I’m dangerous 
about.” 

I kissed her until I heard 
rollerskates coming across the 
' terrace from one direction and a 
horse galloping toward the ter- 
race from the other direction. 

“You have lovely lips,” I whis- 
pered. 

“Thanks. Yours deserve the 

L 



Good Housekeeping Seal of Ap- 
proval, too.” 

Our son reared the new pala- 
mino I had just bought him for 
his fourteenth birthday and 
yelled down, “Unhand that 
maiden, Burrhead, or I’ll give you 
lead poisoning.” 

I laughed and picked up my 
plate and sat down in a chair. My 
wife brought me a bowl of salad 
and I munched the hamburger 
and watched the boy unsaddle 
the horse and slap it away to the 
pasture. 

I thought, “By God, wouldn’t 
he have a fit if he knew what I 
have back there in that lab! 
Wouldn’t they all!” 

The boy carried the saddle up 
onto the terrace and dropped it. 
“Mom, I’d like a swim before I 
eat.” He started undressing. 

“You look as though a little 
water might help,” she agreed, sit- 
ting down next to me with her 
plate. 

The girl was yanking off her 
skates. “And I want one.” 

“All right. But go in the house 
and put on your swim suit.” 

“Oh, Mother. Why?” 

“Because, dear, I said so.” 

The boy had already raced 
across the terrace and jack-knifed 
into the pool. The cool sound of 
the dive sent the girl scurrying 
for her suit. 

I looked at my wife. “What’s 
the idea?”

“She’s going to be a young 
woman soon.” 

“Is that any reason for wearing 
clothes? Look at him. He’s a 
young man sooner than already.” 
“Well, if you feel that way 
about it, they’ll both have to start 
wearing clothes.” 

I gulped the last of my ham- 
burger and washed it down with 
the beer. “This place is going to 
hell,” I complained. “The old 
man isn’t allowed to pinch the 
maid and the kids can’t go 
naked.” I leaned toward her and 
smacked her cheek. “But the food 
and the old woman are still the 
best.” 

“Say, what goes with you? 
You’ve been grinning like a 
happy ape ever since you came 
out of the lab.” 

“I told you — ” 

“Oh, not that again! You were 
dangerous at any age.” 

I stood up and put my plate 
aside and bent over her. “Just 
the same, I’m going to have a new 
kind of fun.” 

CHE REACHED up and 
grabbed my ear. She nar- 
rowed her eyes and put a mock 
grimness on her lips. 

“It’s a joke,” I assured her. “I’m 
going to play a tremendous joke 
on the whole world. I’ve only had 
the feeling once before in a small 
way, but I’ve always . .” 

She twisted my ear and nar- 



rowed her eyes even more. 
“Like?” 

“Well, when my old man was 
pumping his first fortune out of 
some oil wells in Oklahoma, we 
lived down there. Outside this lit- 
tle town, I found a litter of flat 
stones that had young black- 
snakes under each slab. I filled 
a pail with them and took them 
into town and dumped them on 
the walk in front of the movie 
just as Theda Bara’s matinee let 
out. The best part was that no 
one had seen me do it. They just 
couldn’t understand how so many- 
snakes got there. I learned how 
great it can be to stand around 
quietly and watch people encoun- 
ter the surprise that you have pre- 
pared for them.” 

She let go of my ear. “Is that 
the kind of fun you’re going to 
have?” 

“Yep.” 

She shook her head. “Did I say 
you are eccentric?” 

I grinned. “Forgive me if I eat 
and run, dear. Something in the 
lab can’t wait.” 

The fact was that I had some- 
thing more in the lab than I had 
bargained for. I had aimed only 
at a gliding mammal a little more 
efficient than the Dusky Glider 
of Australia, a marsupial. Even 
in the basically mutating colony, 
there had been a decidedly sim- 
ian appearance in recent years, a 
long shift from the garbage-dump 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rats I had started with. But my 
first volplas were shockingly hu- 
manoid. 

They were also much faster 
than had been their predecessors 
in organizing their nervous ac- 
tivity after the slumbrous explo- 
sion of growth in the metabolic 
accelerator. When I returned to 
the lab, they were already mov- 
ing about on the mattress and the 
male was trying to stand. 

He was a little, the larger and 
stood twenty-eight inches high. 
Except for the face, chest and 
belly, they were covered with a 
soft, almost golden down. Where 
it was bare of this golden fur, the 
skin was pink. On their heads and 
across the shoulders of the male 
stood a shock of fur as soft as 
chinchilla. The faces were appeal- 
ingly humanoid, except that the 
eyes were large and nocturnal. 
The cranium was in the same 
proportion to the body as it is in 
the human. 

TP7HEN THE male spread his 
^ arms, the span was forty- 
eight inches. I held his arms out 
and tried to tease the spars open. 
They were not new. The spars 
had been common to the basic 
colony for years and were the 
result of serial mutations effecting 
those greatly elongated fifth fin- 
gers that had first appeared in 
Nijinsky. No longer jointed like 
a finger, the spar turned back- 



ward sharply and ran alongside 
the wrist almost to the elbow. 
Powerful wrist muscles could 
snap it outward and forward. Sud- 
denly, as I teased the male volpla, 
this happened. 

The spars added nine inches on 
each side to his span. As they 
swept out and forward, the lateral 
skin that had, till now, hung in 
resting folds was tightened in a 
golden plane that stretched from 
the tip of the spar to his waist 
and continued four inches wide 
down his legs to where it an- 
chored at the little toe. 

This was by far the most im- 
pressive plane that had appeared 
till now. It was a true gliding 
plane, perhaps even a soaring 
one. I felt a thrill run along my 
back. 

By four o’clock that afternoon, 
I was feeding them solid food 
and, with the spars closed, they 
were holding little cups and 
drinking water from them in a 
most humanlike way. They were 
active, curious, playful and decid- 
edly amorous. 

Their humanoid qualities were 
increasingly apparent. There was 
a lumbar curvature and buttocks. 
The shoulder girdle and pectoral 
muscles were heavy and out of 
proportion, of course, yet the fe- 
males had only one pair of 
breasts. The chin and jaw were 
humanlike instead of simian and 
the dental equipment was appro-

priate to this structure. What this 
portended was brought home to 
me with a shock. 

I was kneeling on the mattress, 
cuffing and roughing the male as 
one might a puppy dog, when one 
of the females playfully climbed 
up my back. I reached around 
and brought her over my shoulder 
and sat her down. I stroked the 
soft fur on her head and said, 
“Hello, pretty one. Hello.” 

The male watched me, grin- 
ning. 

He said, “’Elio, ’ello.” 

A S I walked into the kitchen, 
giddy with this enormous 
joke, my wife said, “Guy and Em 
are flying up for dinner. That 
rocket of Guy’s they launched in 
the desert yesterday was a suc- 
cess. It pulled Guy up to Cloud 
Nine and he wants to celebrate.” 

I danced a little jig the way 
old Nijinsky might do it. “Oh, 
great! Oh, wonderful! Good old 
Guy! Everybody’s a success. It’s 
great. It’s wonderful. Success on 
success!” 

I danced into the kitchen table 
and tipped over a basket of green 
corn. The maid promptly left the 
kitchen for some other place. 

My wife just stared at me. 
“Have you been drinking the lab 
alcohol?” 

“I’ve been drinking the nectar 
of the gods. My Hera, you’re 
properly married to Zeus. I’ve my 



own little Greeks descended from 
Icarus.” 

She pretended a hopeless sag 
of her pretty shoulders. “Wouldn’t 
you just settle for a worldly mar- 
tini?” 

“I will, yes. But first a divine 
kiss.” 

I sipped at my martini and 
lounged in a terrace chair watch- 
ing the golden evening slant 
across the beautiful hills of our 
ranch. I dreamed. I would invent 
a euphonious set of words to 
match the Basic English vocabu- 
lary and teach it to them as their 
language. They would have their 
own crafts and live in small tree 
houses. 

I would teach them legends: 
that they had come from the 
stars, that they had subsequently 
watched the first red men and 
then the first white men enter 
these hills. 

When they were able to take 
care of themselves, I would turn 
them loose. There would be vol- 
pla colonies all up and down the 
Coast before anyone suspected. 
One day, somebody would see a 
volpla. The newspapers would 
laugh. 

Then someone authoritative 
would find a colony and observe 
them. He would conclude, “I am 
convinced that they have a lan- 
guage and speak it intelligently.” 

The government would issue 
denials. Reporters would “expose 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the truth” and ask, “Where have 
these aliens come from?” The 
government would reluctantly 
admit the facts. Linguists would 
observe at close quarters and 
learn the simple volpla language. 
Then would come the legends. 

Volpla wisdom would become 
a cult — and of all forms of com- 
edy, cults, I think, are the fun- 
niest. 

44"|^ARLING, are you listen- 
■L' ing to me?” my wife asked 
with impatient patience. 

“What? Sure. Certainly.” 

“You didn’t hear a word. You 
just sit there and grin into space.” 
She got up and poured me an- 
other martini. “Here, maybe this 
will sober you up.” 

I pointed. “That’s probably 
Guy and Em.” 

A ’copter sidled over the ridge, 
then came just above the oak 
woods toward us. Guy set it gen- 
tly on the landing square and we 
walked down to meet them. 

I helped Em out and hugged 
her. Guy jumped out, asking, “Do 
you have your TV set on?” 

“No,” I answered. “Should I?” 
“It’s almost time for the broad- 
cast. I was afraid we would miss 
it.” 

“What broadcast?” 

“From the rocket.” 

“Rocket?” 

“For heaven’s sake, darling,” 
my wife complained, “I told you 



about Gu 5 ^s rocket being a suc- 
cess. The papers are full of it. So 
are the broadcasts.” 

As we stepped up on the ter- 
race, she turned to Guy and Em. 
“He’s out of contact today. Thinks 
he’s Zeus.” 

I asked our son to wheel a TV 
set out onto the terrace while I 
made martinis for our friends. 
Then we sat down and drank the 
cocktails and the kids had fruit 
juice and we watched the broad- 
cast Guy had tuned in. 

Some joker from Cal Tech was 
explaining diagrams of a multi- 
stage rocket. 

After a bit, I got up and said, 
“I have something out in the lab 
I want to check on.” 

“Hey, wait a minute,” Guy ob- 
jected. “They’re about to show 
the shots of the launching.” 

My wife gave me a look; you 
know the kind. I sat down. Then 
I got up and poured myself an- 
other martini and freshened Em’s 
up, too. I sat down again. 

The scene had changed to a 
desert launching site. There was 
old Guy himself explaining that 
when he pressed the button be- 
fore him, the hatch on the third 
stage of the great rocket in the 
background would close and, five 
minutes later, the ship would fire 
itself. 

Guy, on the screen, pushed the 
button, and I heard Guy, beside 
me, give a sort of little sigh. We 



VOLPLA 



13 



watched the hatch slowly close. 

“You look real good,” I said. 
“A regular Space Ranger. What 
are you shooting at?” 

“Darling, will you please — be 
— quiet?” 

“Yeah, Dad. Can it, will you? 
You’re always gagging around.” 

THE screen, Guy’s big 
dead-earnest face was ex- 
plaining more about the project 
and suddenly I realized that this 
was an instrument-bearing rocket 
they hoped to land on the Moon. 
It would broadcast from there. 
Well, now — say, that would be 
something! I began to feel a little 
ashamed of the way I had been 
acting and I reached out and 
slapped old Guy on the shoulder. 
For just a moment, I thought of 
telling him about my volplas. But 
only for a moment. 

A ball of flame appeared at the 
base of the rocket. Miraculously, 
the massive tower lifted, seemed 
for a moment merely to stand 
there on a flaming pillar, then was 
gone. 

The screen returned to a stu- 
dio, where an announcer ex- 
plained that the film just shown 
had been taken day before yes- 
terday. Since then, the rocket’s 
third stage was known to have 
landed successfully at the south 
shore of Mare Serenitatis. He in- 
dicated the location on a large 
lunar map behind him. 

14 



“From this position, the tele- 
meter known as Rocket Charlie 
will be broadcasting scientific 
data for several months. But now, 
ladies and gentlemen, we will 
clear the air for Rocket Charlie’s 
only general broadcast. Stand by 
for Rocket Charlie.” 

A chronometer appeared on 
the screen and, for several sec- 
onds, there was silence. 

I heard my boy whisper, “Uncle 
Guy, this is the biggest!” 

My wife said, “Em, I think I’ll 
just faint.” 

Suddenly there was a lunar 
landscape on the screen, looking 
just as it’s always been pictured. 
A mechanical voice cut in. 

“This is Rocket Charlie saying, 
‘Hello, Earth,’ from my position 
in Mare Serenitatis. First I will 
pan the Menelaus Mountains for 
fifteen seconds. Then I will focus 
my camera on Earth for five sec- 
onds.” 

The camera began to move and 
the mountains marched by, stark 
and awesomely wild. Toward the 
end of the movement, the shadow 
of the upright third stage ap- 
peared in the foreground. 

Abruptly the camera made a 
giddy swing, focused a moment, 
and we were looking at Earth. At 
that time, there was no Moon 
over California. It was Africa and 
Europe we were looking at. 

“This is Rocket Charlie saying, 
‘Good-by, Earth.’ ”

Well, when that screen went 
dead, there was pandemonium 
around our terrace. Big old Guy 
was so happy, he was wiping tears 
from his eyes. The women were 
kissing him and hugging him. 
Everybody was yelling at once. 

1 USED THE metabolic acceler- 
ator to cut the volplas’ gesta- 
tion down to one week. Then I 
used it to bring the infants to 
maturity in one month. I had luck 
right off. Quite by accident, the 
majority of the early infants were 
females, which sped things up 
considerably. 

By the next spring, I had a col- 
ony of over a hundred volplas and 
I shut down the accelerator. From 
now on, they could have babies in 
their own way. 

I had devised the language for 
them, using Basic English as my 
model, and during the months 
while every female was busy 
in the metabolic accelerator, I 
taught the language to the males. 
They spoke it softly in high 
voices and the eight hundred 
words didn’t seem to tax their 
little skulls a bit. 

My wife and the kids went 
down to Santa Barbara for a 
week and I took the opportunity 
to slip the oldest of the males 
and his two females out of the 
lab. 

I put them in the jeep beside 
me and drove to a secluded little 



valley about a mile back in the 
ranch. 

They were all three wide-eyed 
at the world and jabbered con- 
tinuously. They kept me busy re- 
lating their words for “tree,” 
“rock,” “sky” to the objects. They 
had a little trouble with “sky.” 

Until I had them out in the 
open country, it had been impos- 
sible to appreciate fully what 
lovely little creatures they were. 
They blended perfectly with the 
California landscape. Occasion- 
ally, when they raised their arms, 
the spars would open and spread 
those glorious planes. 

Almost two hours went by be- 
fore the male made it into the 
air. His playful curiosity about 
the world had been abandoned 
momentarily and he was chasing 
one of the girls. As usual, she 
was anxious to be caught and 
stopped abruptly at the bottom of 
a little knoll. 

He probably meant to dive for 
her. But when he spread his arms, 
the spars snapped out and those 
golden planes sheared into the 
air. He sailed over her in a stun- 
ning sweep. Then he rose up and 
iip until he hung in the breeze for 
a long moment, thirty feet above 
the ground. 

He turned a plaintive face back 
to me, dipped worriedly and 
skimmed straight for a thorn 
bush. He banked instinctively, 
whirled toward us in a golden

flash and crashed with a bounce 
to the grass. 

The two girls reached him be- 
fore I did and stroked and fussed 
over him so that I could not get 
near. Suddenly he laughed with 
a shrill little whoop. After that, it 
was a carnival. 

^ I ''HEY LEARNED quickly and 
brilliantly. They were not fli- 
ers; they were gliders and soarers. 
Before long, they took agilely to 
the trees and launched them- 
selves in beautiful glides for hun- 
dreds of feet, banking, turning 
and spiraling to a gentle halt. 

I laughed out loud with antici- 
pation. Wait till the first pair of 
these was brought before a sher- 
iff! Wait till reporters from the 
Chornicle motored out into the 
hills to witness this! 

Of course, the volplas didn’t 
want to return to the lab. There 
was a tiny stream through there 
and at one point it formed a siz- 
able pool. They got into this and 
splashed their long arms about 
and they scrubbed each other. 
Then they got out and lay on 
their backs with the planes 
stretched to dry. 

I watched them affectionately 
and wondered about the advisa- 
bility of leaving them out here. 
Well, it had to be done sometime. 
Nothing I could tell them about 
surviving would help them as 
much as a little actual surviving. 

16 



I called the male over to me. 

He came and squatted, confer- 
ence fashion, the elbows resting 
on the ground, the wrists crossed 
at his chest. He spoke first. 

“Before the red men came, did 
we live here?” 

“You lived in places like this 
all along these mountains. Now 
there are very few of you left. 
Since you have been staying at 
my place, you naturally have for- 
gotten the ways of living out- 
doors.” 

“We can learn again. We want 
to stay here.” His little face was 
so solemn and thoughtful that I 
reached out and stroked the fur 
on his head reassuringly. ' 

We both heard the whir of 
wings overhead. Two mourning 
doves flew across the stream and 
landed in an oak on the opposite 
hillside. 

I pointed. “There’s your food, 
if you can kill it.” 

He looked at me. “How?” 

“I don’t think you can get at 
them in the tree. You’ll have to 
soar up above and catch one of 
them on the wing when they fly 
away. Think you can get up that 
high?” 

He looked around slowly at the 
breeze playing in the branches 
and dancing along the hillside 
grass. It was as if he had been 
flying a thousand years and was 
bringing antique wisdom to bear. 

“I can get up there. I can stay 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



for a while. How long will they 
be in the tree?” 

“Chances are they won’t stay 
long. Keep your eye on the tree 
in case they leave while you are 
climbing.” 

H e ran to a nearby oak and 
clambered aloft. Presently 
he launched himself, streaked 
down-valley a way and caught a 
warm updraft on a hillside. In no 
time, he was up about two hun- 
dred feet. He began criss-crossing 
the ridge, working his way back 
to us. 

The two girls were watching 
him intently. They came over to 
me wonderingly, stopping now 
and then to watch him. When 
they were standing beside me, 
they said nothing. They shaded 
their eyes with tiny hands and 
watched him as he passed directly 
above us at about two hundred 
and fifty feet. One of the girls, 
with her eyes fast on his soaring 
planes, reached out and grasped 
my sleeve tightly. 

He flashed high above the 
stream and hung behind the crest 
of the hill where the doves rested. 
I heard their mourning from the 
oak tree. It occurred to me they 
would not leave that safety while 
the hawklike silhouette of the 
volpla marred the sky so near. 

I took the girl’s hand from my 
sleeve and spoke to her, pointing 
as I did so. “He is going to catch 



a bird. The bird is in that tree. 
You can make the bird fly so that 
he can catch it. Look here.” I got 
up and found a stick. “Can you 
do this?” 

I threw the stick up into a tree 
near us. Then I found her a stick. 
She threw it better than I had 
expected. 

“Good, pretty one. Now run 
across the stream and up to that 
tree and throw a stick into it.” 

She climbed skillfully into the 
tree beside us and launched her- 
self across the stream. She 
swooped up the opposite hillside 
and landed neatly in the tree 
where the doves rested. 

The birds came out of the tree, 
climbing hard with their graceful 
strokes. 

I looked back, as did the girl 
remaining beside me. The soaring 
volpla half closed his planes and 
started dropping. He became a 
golden flash across the sky. 

The doves abruptly gave up 
their hard climbing and fell away 
with swiftly beating wings. I saw 
one of the male volpla’s planes 
open a little. He veered giddily in 
the new direction and again 
dropped like a molten arrow. 

The doves separated and began 
to zigzag down the valley. The 
volpla did something I would not 
have anticipated — he opened 
his planes and shot lower than 
the bird he was after, then swept 
up and intercepted the bird’s 



VOIPI A 



17 



crossward flight. 

I saw the planes close momen- 
tarily. Then they opened again 
and the bird plummeted to a hill- 
side. The volpla landed gently 
atop the hill and stood looking 
back at us. 

The volpla beside me danced 
up and down shrieking in a lan- 
guage all her own. The girl who 
had raised the birds from the tree 
volplaned back to us, yammering 
like a bluejay. 

TT WAS a herp’s welcome. He 

had to walk back, of course — 
he had no way to carry such a 
load in flight. The girls glided 

18 



out to meet him. Their lavish af- 
fection held him up for a time, 
but eventually he strutted in like 
every human hunter. 

They were raptly curious about 
the bird. They poked at it, mar- 
veled at its feathers and danced 
about it in an embryonic rite of 
the hunt. But presently the male 
turned to me 

“We eat this?” 

I laughed and took his tiny, 
four-fingered hand. In a sandy 
spot beneath a great tree that 
overhung the creek, I built a 
small fire for them. This was an- 
other marvel, but first 1 wanted 
to teach them how to clean the

“Yes. I will bring many more 
of you, if you promise to keep 
them all here in this woods until 
the 3 r’re ready to leave.” 

“I promise.” He looked up at 
the night sky and, in the firelight, 
I saw his wonder. “You say we 
came from there?” 

“The old ones of your kind told 
me so. Didn’t they tell you?” 

“I can’t remember any old ones. 
You tell me.” 

“The old ones told me you 
came long before the red men in 
a ship from the stars.” Standing 
there in the dark, I had to grin, 
visioning the Simday supple- 
ments that would be written in 



bird. I showed them how to spit 
it and turn it over their fire. 

Later, I shared a small piece 
of the meat in their feast. They 
were gleeful and greasily amorous 
during the meal. 

When I had to leave, it was 
dark. I warned them to stand 
watches, keep the fire burning low 
and take to the tree above if any- 
thing approached. The male 
walked a little away with me 
when I left the fire. 

I said again, “Promise me you 
won’t leave here until we’ve made 
you ready for it.” 

“We like it here. We will stay. 
Tomorrow you bring more of us?”

about a year, maybe even less. 

He looked into the sky for a 
long time. “Those little lights are 
the stars?” 

“That’s right.” 

“Which star?” 

I glanced about and presently 
pointed over a tree. “From 
Venus.” Then I realized I had 
blundered by passing him an 
English name. “In your language 
Pohtah.” ’ 

He looked at the planet a long 
time and murmured, “Venus. 
Pohtah.” 

T^HAT NEXT week, I trans- 
ported all of the volplas out 
to the oak woods. There were a 
hundred and seven men, women 
and children. With no design on 
niy part, they tended to segregate 
into groups consisting of four to 
eight couples together with the 
current children of the women. 
Within these groups, the adults 
were promiscuous, but apparently 
not outside the group. The group 
thus had the appearance of a 
super-family and the males in- 
dulged and cared for all the chil- 
dren without reference to actual 
parenthood. 

By the end of the week, these 
super-families were scattered over 
about four square miles of the 
ranch. They had found a new 
delicacy, sparrows, and hunted 
them easily as they roosted at 
night. I had taught the volplas to 
20 



use the fire drill and they were 
already utilizing the local grasses, 
vines and brush to build marvel- 
ously contrived tree houses in 
which the young, and sometimes 
the adults, slept through midday 
and midnight. 

The afternoon my family re- 
turned home, I had a crew of 
workmen out tearing down the 
animal rooms and lab building. 
The caretakers had anesthetized 
all the experimental mutants, and 
the metabolic accelerator and 
other lab equipment was being 
dismantled. I wanted nothing 
around that might connect the 
sudden appearance of the volplas 
with my property. It was already 
apparent that it would take the 
volplas only a few more weeks to 
learn their means of survival and 
develop an embryonic culture of 
their own. Then they could leave 
my ranch and the fun would be 
on. 

My wife got out of the car and 
looked around at the workmen 
hurrying about the disemboweled 
buildings and she said, “What on 
Earth is going on here?” 

“I’ve finished my work and we 
no longer need the buildings. I’m 
going to write a paper about my 
results. 

My wife looked at me apprais- 
ingly and shook her head. “I 
thought you meant it. But you 
really ought to. It would be your 
first.” 

GAlAXy SCIENCE FICTION 



My son asked, “What happened 
to the animals?” 

“Turned them over to the uni- 
versity for further study,” I lied. 

“Well,” he said to her, “you 
can’t say our pop isn’t a man of 
decision.” 

Twenty-four hours later, there 
wasn’t a sign of animal experi- 
mentation on the ranch. 

Except, of course, that the 
woods were full of volplas. At 
night, I could hear them faintly 
when I sat out on the terrace. As 
they passed through the dark 
overhead, they chattered and 
laughed and sometimes moaned 
in winged love. One night a flight 
of them soared slowly across the 
face of the full Moon, but I was 
the only one who noticed. 

I MADE DAILY trips out to 
the original camp to meet the 
oldest of the males, who had ap- 
parently established himself as 
a chief of all the volpla families. 
He assured me that the volplas 
were staying close to the ranch, 
but complained that the game 
was getting scarce. Otherwise 
things were progressing nicely. 

The males now carried little 
stone-tipped spears with feathered 
shafts that they could throw in 
flight. They used them at night 
to bring down roosting sparrows 
and in the day to kill their big- 
gest game, the local rabbits. 

The women wore b 1 u e j a y 



feathers on their heads. The men 
wore plumes of dove feathers and 
sometimes little skirts fashioned 
of rabbit down. I did some read- 
ing on the subject and taught 
them crude tanning of their rab- 
bit and squirrel hides for use in 
their tree homes. 

The tree homes were more and 
more intricately wrought with ex- 
pert basketry for walls and floor 
and tight thatching above. They 
were well camouflaged from 
below, as I suggested. 

These little creatures delighted 
me more and more. For hours, I 
could watch the adults, both the 
males and females, playing with 
the children or teaching them to 
glide. I could sit all afternoon and 
watch them at work on a tree 
house. 

So one day my wife asked, 
“How does the mighty hunter 
who now returns from the forest?” 

“Oh, fine. I’ve been enjoying 
the local animal life.” 

“So has our daughter.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“She has two of them up in her 
room.” 

“Two what?” 

“I don’t know. What do you 
call them?” 

I went up the stairs three at a 
time and burst into my daughter’s 
room. 

There she sat on her bed read- 
ing a book to two volplas. 

One of the volplas grinned and 



VOLPLA

said in English, “Hello there, King 
Arthur.” 

“What’s going on here?” I de- 
manded of all three. 

“Nothing, Daddy. We’re just 
reading like we always do.” 

“Like always? How long has 
this been going on?” 

“Oh, weeks and weeks. How 
long has it been since you came 
here that first time to visit me. 
Fuzzy?” 

The impolite volpla who had 
addressed me as King Arthur 
grinned at her and calculated. 
“Oh, weeks and weeks.” 

“But you’re teaching them to 
read English.” 

“Of course. They’re such good 
pupils and so grateful. Daddy, 
you won’t make them go away, 
will you? We love each other, 
don’t we?” 

Both V o 1 p 1 a s nodded vigor- 
ously. 

She turned back to me. 
“Daddy, did you know they can 
fly? They can fly right out of the 
window and way up in the sky.” 

“Is that a fact?” I said testily. 

I looked coldly at the two volplas. 
“I’m going to speak to your chief.” 

rjACK DOWNSTAIRS again, 

I raved at my wife. “Why 
didn’t you tell me a thing like this 
was going on? How could you let 
such an unusual thing go on and 
not discuss it with me?” 

My wife got a look on her face 



that I don’t see very often. “Now 
you listen to me, mister. Your 
whole life is a secret from us. 
Just what makes you think your 
daughter can’t have a little secret 
of her own?” 

She got right up close to me 
and her blue eyes snapped little 
sparks all over me. “The fact is 
that I was wrong to tell you at 
all. I promised her I wouldn’t tell 
anyone. Look what happened 
when I did. You go leaping 
aroimd the house like a raving 
maniac just because a little girl 
has a secret.” 

“A fine secret!” I yelled. “Didn’t 
it occur to you this might be dan- 
gerous? Those creatures are over- 
sexed and ...” I stumbled into an 
awful silence while she gave me 
the dirtiest smile since the days 
of the Malatestas. 

“How did you . suddenly get 
to be . the palace eunuch? 
Those are sweet lovable little 
creatures without a harm in their 
furry little bodies. But don’t think 
I don’t realize what’s been going 
on. You created them yourself. 
So, if they have any dirty ideas, 

I know where they got them.” 

I stormed out of the house. I 
spun the jeep out of the yard and 
ripped off through the woods. 

The chief was sitting at home 
as comfortable as you please. He 
was leaning back against the 
great oak that hid his tree house. 
He had a little fire going and one 



22 



6AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of the women was roasting a spar- 
row for him. He greeted me in 
volpla language. 

“Do you realize,” I blurted an- 
grily, “that there are two volplas 
in my daughter’s bedroom?” 

“Why, yes,” he answered 
calmly. ‘They go there every day. 
Is there anything wrong with 
that?” 

“She’s teaching them the words 
of men.” 

“You told us some men may be 
our enemies. We are anxious to 
know their words, the better to 
protect ourselves.” 

He reached atound behind the 
tree and, right there in broad day- 
light, that volpla pulled a copy 
of the San Francisco Chronicle 
out of hiding. He held it up apolo- 
getically. “We have been taking 
it for some time from the box in 
front of your house.” 

He spread the paper on the 
ground between us. I saw by the 
date that it was yesterday’s. He 
said proudly, ‘Trom the two who 
go to your house, I have learned 
the words of men. As men say, I 
can ‘read’ most of this.” 

1 JUST STOOD there gaping at 
him. How could I possibly re- 
coup this situation so that the 
stunning joke of the volplas 
wouldn’t be lost? Would it seem 
reasonable that the volplas, by 
observing and listening to men, 
had learned their language? Or 



had they been taught it by a 
human friend? 

That was it — I would just 
have to sacrifice anonymity. My 
family and I had found a colony 
of them on our ranch and taught 
them English. I was stuck with it 
because it was the truth. 

The volpla waved his long thin 
arm over the front page. “Men 
are dangerous. They will shoot 
us with their guns if we leave 
here.” 

I hastened to reassure him. “It 
will not be like that. When men 
have learned about you, they will 
leave you alone.” I stated this 
emphatically, but for the first 
time I was beginning to see this 
might not be a joke to the volplas. 
Nevertheless, I went on. “You 
must disperse the families at once. 
You stay here wtih your family 
so we remain in contact, but send 
the other families to other places.” 

He shook his head. “We cannot 
leave these woods. Men would 
shoot us.” 

Then he stood and looked 
squarely at me with his nocturnal 
eyes. “Perhaps you are not a good 
friend. Perhaps you have lied to 
us. Why are you saying we should 
leave this safety?” 

“You will be happier. There 
will be more game.” 

He continued to stare directly 
at me. “There will be men. One 
has already shot one of us. We 
have forgiven him and are 



VOLPLA 



23 



friends. But one of us is dead.” 
“You are friends with another 
man?” I asked, stunned. 

He nodded and pointed up the 
valley. “He is up there today with 
another family.” 

“Let’s go!” 

He had the advantage of short 
glides, but the volpla chief 
couldn’t keep up with me. Some- 
times trotting, sometimes walking 
fast, I got way ahead of him. My 
hard breathing arose as much out 
of my anxiety about the manner 
of handling this stranger as it did 
out of the exertion. 

I rounded a bend in the creek 
and there was my son sitting on 
the grass near a cooking fire play- 
ing with a baby volpla and talk- 
ing in English to an adult volpla 
who stood beside him. As I ap^ 
proached, my son tossed the baby 
into the air. The tiny planes 
opened and the baby drifted 
down to his waiting hands. 

He said to the volpla beside 
him, “No, I’m sure you didn’t 
come from the stars. The more I 
think about it, the more I’m sure 
my father — ” 

I yelled from behind them, 
“What business do you have tell- 
ing them that?” 

*'j''HE MALE volpla jumped 
about two feet. My son 
turned his head slowly and looked 
at me. Then he handed the baby 
to the male and stood up. 

24 



“You haven’t any business out 
here!” I was seething. He had 
destroyed the whole store of vol- 
pla legends with one small doubt. 

He brushed the grass from his 
trousers and straightened. The 
way he was looking at me, I felt 
my anger turning to a kind of 
jelly. 

“Dad, I killed one of these lit- 
tle people yesterday. I thought 
he was a hawk and I shot him 
when I was out hunting. I 
wouldn’t have done that if you 
had told me about them.” 

I couldn’t look at him. I stared 
at the grass and my face got hot. 

"The chief tells me that you 
want them to leave the ranch 
soon. You think you’re going to 
play a big joke, don’t you?” 

I heard the chief come up be- 
hind me and stand quietly at my 
back. 

My son said softly, “I don’t 
think it’s much of a joke. Dad. 

I had to listen to that one crying 
after I hit him.” 

There were big black trail ants 
moving in the grass. It seemed to 
me there was a ringing sound in 
the sky. I raised my head and 
looked at him. “Son, let’s go back 
to the jeep and we can talk about 
it on the way home.” 

“I’d rather walk.” He sort of 
waved to the volpla he had been 
talking to and then to the chief. 
He jumped the creek and walked 
away into the oak woods. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The volpla holding the baby 
stared at me. From somewhere 
far up the valley, a crow was caw- 
ing. I didn’t . look at the chief. I 
turned and brushed past him and 
walked back to the jeep alone. 

At home, I opened a bottle of 
beer and sat out on the terrace 
to wait for my son. My wife came 
toward the house with some cut 
flowers from the garden, but she 
didn’t speak to me. She snapped 
the blades of the scissors as she 
walked. 

A volpla soared across the ter- 
race and landed at my daughter’s 
bedroom window. He was there 
only briefly and relaunched him- 
self. He was followed from the 
window in moments by the two 
V o 1 p 1 a s I had left with my 
daughter earlier in the afternoon. 
I watched them with a vague un- 
ease as the three veered off to the 
east, climbing effortlessly. 

When I finally took a sip of my 
beer, it was already warm. I set 
it aside. Presently my daughter 
ran out onto the terrace. 

“Daddy, my volplas left. They 
said good-by and we hadn’t even 
finished the TV show. They said 
they won’t see me again. Did you 
make them leave?” 

“No. I didn’t.” 

She was staring at me with hot 
eyes. Her lower lip protruded and 
trembled like a pink tear drop. 

“Daddy, you did so.” She 
stomped into the house, sobbing. 



My God! In one afternoon, I 
had managed to become a palace 
eunuch, a murderer and a liar! 

M ost of the afternoon went 
by before I heard my son 
enter the house. I called to him 
and he came out and stood before 
me. I got up. 

“Son, I can’t tell you how sorry 
I am for what happened to you. 
It was my fault, not yours at all. 
I only hope you can forget the 
shock of finding out what sort of 
creature you had hit. I don’t know 
why I didn’t anticipate that such 
things would happen. It was just 
that I was so intent on mystifying 
the whole world that I . .” 

I stopped. There wasn’t any- 
thing more to say. 

“Are you going to make them 
leave the ranch?” he asked. 

I was aghast. “After what has 
happened?” 

“Gee, what are you going to do 
about them. Dad?” 

“I’ve been trying to decide. I 
don’t know what I should do that 
will be best for them.” I looked 
at my watch. “Let’s go back out 
and talk to the chief.” 

His eyes lighted and he 
clapped me on the shoulder, man 
to man. We ran out and got into 
the jeep and drove back up to 
the valley. The late afternoon 
Sun glared across the landscape. 

We didn’t say much as we 
wound up the valley between the 



VOLPLA

darkening trees. I was filled more 
and more with the unease that 
had seized me as I watched the 
three volplas leave my terrace 
and climb smoothly and purpose- 
fully into the east. 

We got out at the chiefs camp 
and there were no volplas around. 
The fire had burned down to a 
smolder. I called in the volpla 
language, but there was no an- 
swer. 

We went from camp to camp 
and found dead fires. We climbed 
to their tree houses and found 
them empty. I was sick and 
scared. I called endlessly till I 
was hoarse. 

At last, in the darkness, my son 
put a hand on my arm. “What are 
you going to do. Dad?” 

Standing there in those terribly 
silent woods, I trembled. “I’ll have 
to call the police and the news- 
papers and warn everybody.” 

“Where do you suppose they’ve 
gone?” 

I looked to the east where the 
stars, rising out of the great pass 
in the mountains, glimmered like 
a deep bowl of fireflies. 

**The last three I saw were 
headed that way.” 

HAD been gone from the 
^ house for hours. When we 
stepped out onto the lighted ter- 
race, I saw the shadow of a heli- 
copter down on the strip. Then I 
saw Guy sitting near me in a 

26 



chair. He was holding his head in 
his hands. 

Em was saying to my wife, “He 
was beside himself. There wasn’t 
a thing he could do. I had to get 
him away from there and I 
thought you wouldn’t mind if we 
flew over here and stayed with 
you till they’ve decided what to 
do.” 

I walked over and said, “Hello, 
Guy. What’s the matter?” 

He raised his head and then 
stood and shook hands. “It’s a 
mess. The whole project will be 
ruined and we don’t dare go near 
it.” 

“What happened?” 

“Just as we set it off — ” 

“Set what off?” 

“The rocket.” 

“Rocket?” 

Guy groaned. 

“The Venus rocket! Rocket 
Harold!” 

My wife interjected. “I was tell- 
ing Guy we didn’t know a thing 
about it because they haven’t de- 
livered our paper in weeks. I’ve 
complained — ” 

I waved her to silence. “Go on,” 

I demanded of Guy. 

“Just as I pushed the button 
and the hatch was closing, a flock 
of owls circled the ship. They 
started flying through the hatch 
and somehow they jammed it 
open.” 

Em said to my wife, “There 
must have been a hundred of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




them. They kept coming and com- 
ing and flying into that hatch. 
Then they began dumping out 
all the recording instruments. The 
men tried to run a motor-driven 
ladder up to the ship and those 
owls hit the driver on the head 
and knocked him out with some 
kind of instrument.” 

Guy turned his grief-stricken 
face to me. “Then the hatch 
closed and we don’t dare go near 
the ship. It was supposed to fire 
in five minutes, but it hasn’t. 
Those damned owls could have. .” 
There was a glare in the east. 
We all turned and saw a brief 
streak of gilt pencil its way 
up the black velvet beyond the 
mountains. 

“That’s it!” Guy shouted. 
“That’s the ship!” Then he moan- 
ed. “A total loss.” 

I grabbed him by the shoulders. 
“You mean it won’t make it to 
Venus?” 

He jerked away in misery. 
“Sure, it will make it. The auto- 
matic controls can’t be tampered 
with. But the rocket is on its way 
without any recording instru- 
ments or’ TV aboard. Just a load 
of owls.” 

My son laughed. “Owls! My 
dad can tell you a thing or two.” 
I silenced him with a scowl. 
He shut up, then danced off across 
the terrace. “Man, man! This is 
the biggest! The most — the great- 
est — the end!” 



VOLPLA

^T^HE PHONE was ringing. As 
I went to the box on the ter- 
race, I grabbed my boy’s arm. 
“Don’t you breathe a word.” 

He giggled. “The joke is on you, 
Pop. Why should I say anything? 
I’ll just grin once in a while.” 
“Now you cut that out.” 

He held onto my arm and walk- 
ed toward the phone box with me, 
half convulsed. “Wait till men 
land on Venus and find Venusians 
with a legend about their Great 
White Father in California. That’s 
when I’ll tell.” 

The phone call was from a 
screaming psychotic who wanted 
Guy. I stood near Guy while he 
listened to the excited voice over 
the wire. 

Presently Guy said, “No, no. 
The automatic controls will cor- 
rect for the delay in firing. It isn’t 
that. It’s just that there aren’t any 
instruments. What? What just 
happened? Calm down. I can’t un- 
derstand you.” 

I heard Em say to my wife, 
“You know, the strangest thing 
occurred out there. I thought it 
looked like those owls were car- 
rying things on their backs. One 
of them dropped something and 
I saw the men open a package 
wrapped in a leaf. You’d never 
believe what was in it — ^three lit- 
tle birds roasted to a nice brown!” 
My son nudged me. “Smart 
owls. Long trip.” 

I put my hand over his mouth. 



Then I saw that Guy was holding 
the receiver limply away from his 
ear. 

He spluttered. “They just taped 
a radio message from the rocket. 
It’s true that the radio wasn’t 
thrown out. But we didn’t have a 
record like this on that rocket.” 

He yelled into the phone. “Play 
it back.” He thrust the receiver 
at me. 

For a moment, there was only 
a gritty buzz from the receiver. 
Then the tape started playing a 
soft, high voice. “This is Rocket 
Harold saying ever3dhing is well. 
This is Rocket Harold saying 
good-by to men.” There was a 
pause and then, in clear volpla 
language, another voice spoke. 
“Man who made us, we forgive 
you. We know we did not come 
from the stars, but we go there. 
I, chief, give you welcome to visit. 
Good-by.” 

ALL stood around too ex- 
” hausted by the excitement 
to say anything. I was filled with 
a big, sudden sadness. 

I stood for a long time and 
looked out to the east, where the 
sprawling mountain range held a 
bowl of dancing fireflies between 
her black breasts. 

Presently I said to old Guy, 
“How long do you think it will 
be before you have a manned 
rocket ready for Venus?”

Name 

your symptom 

By JIM HARMON 

Illustrated by WEISS 



Anybody who shunned a Cure 
needed his head examined — 
assuming he had one left! 



H enry infield placed 

the insulated circlet on 
his head gently. The 
gleaming rod extended above his 
head about a foot, the wires from 
it leading down into his collar, 
along his spine and finally out 
his pants leg to a short metallic 
strap that dragged on the floor. 



Clyde Morgan regarded his 
partner. “Suppose — just suppose 
— you were serious about this, 
why not just the shoes?” 

Infield turned his soft blue 
eyes to the black and tan ox- 
fords with the very thick rubber 
soles. “They might get soaked 
through.” 



NAME YOUR SYMPTOM 



29 



Morgan took his foot off the 
chair behind the desk and sat 
down. “Suppose they were soaked 
through and you were standing 
on a metal plate — steps or a 
manhole cover — what good 
would your lightning rod do you 
then?” 

Infield shrugged slightly. “I 
suppose a man must take some 
chances.” 

Morgan said, “You can’t do it, 
Henry. You’re crossing the line. 
The people we treat are on one 
side of the line and we’re on the 
other. If you cross that line, you 
won’t be able to treat people 
again.” 

The small man looked out the 
large window, blinking myopical- 
ly at the brassy sunlight. “That’s 
just it, Clyde. There is a line be- 
tween us, a wall. How can we 
really understand the people who 
come to us, if we hide on our 
side of the wall?” 

Morgan shook his thick head, 
ruffling his thinning red hair. “I 
dunno, Henry, but staying on our 
side is a pretty good way to keep 
sane and that’s quite an accom- 
plishment these days.” 

Infield whirled and stalked to 
the desk. “That’s the answer! The 
whole world is going mad and we 
are just sitting back watching it 
hike along. Do you know that 
what we are doing is really the 
most primitive medicine in the 
world? We are treating the symp>- 

30 



toms and not the disease. One 
cannibal walking another with 
sleeping sickness doesn’t cure 
anything. Eventually the savage 
— just as all those sick sav- 
ages out in the street will die un- 
less we can cure the disease, not 
only the indications.” 

IY/TORGAN shifted his ponder- 
-‘-▼ious weight uneasily. “Now, 
Henry, it’s no good to talk like 
that. We psychiatrists can’t turn 
back the clock. There just aren’t 
enough of us or enough time to 
give that old-fashioned therapy 
to all the sick people.” 

Infield leaned on the desk and 
glared. “I called myself a psychi- 
atrist once. But now I know we’re 
semi-mechanics, semi-engineers, 
semi-inventors, semi lots of other 
things, but certainly not even 
semi-psychiatrists. A psychiatrist 
wouldn’t give a foetic gyro to a 
man with claustrophobia.” 

His mind went back to the 
first gyro ball he had ever issued; 
the remembrance of his pride in 
the thing sickened him. Floating 
before him in memory was the 
vertical hoop and the horizontal 
hoop, both of shining steel-imper- 
vium alloy. Transfixed in the twin 
circles was the face of the patient, 
slack with smiles and sweat. But 
his memory was exaggerating the 
human element. The gyro actu- 
ally passed over a man’s shoulder, 
through his legs, under his arms. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




NAME YOUR SYMPTOM 



31 



Any time he felt the walls creep- 
ing in to crush him, he could with- 
draw his head and limbs into the 
circle and feel safe. Steel-imper- 
vium alloy could resist even a 
nuclear explosion. The foetic gyro 
ball was worn day and night, for 
life. 

The sickness overcame him. 
He sat down on Morgan’s desk. 
“That’s just one thing, the gyro 
ball. There are so many others, 
so many.” 

Morgan smiled. “You know, 
Henry, not all of our Cures are 
so — so — not all are like that. 
Those Cures for mother com- 
plexes aren’t even obvious. If any- 
body does see that button in a 
patient’s ear, it looks like a hear- 
ing aid. Yet for a nominal sum, 
the patient is equipped to hear 
the soothing recorded voice of his 
mother saying, ‘It’s all right, 
everything’s all right. Mommy 
loves you, it’s all right . .’” 

“But is everything all right?” 
Infield asked intensely. “Suppose 
the patient is driving over one 
hundred on an icy road. He thinks 
about slowing down, but there’s 
the voice in his ear. Or suppose 
he’s walking down a railroad 
track and hears a train whistle 
— if he can hear anything over 
that verbal pablum gushing in 
his ear.” 

Morgan’s face stiffened. “You 
know as well as I do that those 
voices are nearly subsonic. They 

32 



don’t cut a sense efi^ciency more 
than 23 per cent.” 

“At first, Clyde — only at first. 
But what about the severe case 
where we have to burn a three- 
dimensional smiling mother-image 
on the eyes of the patient with 
radiation? With that image over 
everything he sees and with that 
insidious voice drumming in his 
head night and day, do you mean 
to say that man’s senses will only 
be impaired 23 per cent? Why, 
he’ll turn violently schizophrenic 
sooner or later — and you know 
it. The only cure we have for 
that is still a straitjacket, a 
padded cell or one of those inhu- 
man lobotomies.” 

Morgan shrugged helplessly. 
“You’re an idealist.” 

“You’re damned right!” Infield 
slammed the door behind him. 

1 1 3HE cool air of the street was 
A a relief. Infield stepped into 
the main stream of human traffic 
and tried to adjust to the second 
change in the air. People didn’t 
bathe very often these days. 

He walked along, buffeted by 
the crowd, carried along in this 
direction, shoved back in that 
direction. Most people in the 
crowd seemed to be Normals, but 
you couldn’t tell. Many “Cures” 
were not readily apparent. 

A young man with black glass- 
es and a radar headset (a pho- 
tophobe) was unable to keep 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



from being pushed against Infield. 
He sounded out the lightning rod, 
his face changing when he real- 
ized it must be some kind of Cure. 
“Pardon me,” he said warmly. 

“Quite all right” 

It was the first time in years 
that anyone had apologized to 
Infield for anything. He had been 
one of those condemned Normals, 
more to be scorned than pitied. 
Perhaps he could really get to 
understand these people, now that 
he had taken down the wall. 

Suddenly something else was 
pushing against Infield, forcing 
the air from his lungs. He stared 
down at the magnetic suction 
dart clinging leechlike to his 
chest Model Acrophobe 101-X, 
he catalogued immediately. De- 
scription; safety belt. But his 
emotions didn’t behave so well. 
He was thoroughly terrified, heart 
racing, sweat glands pumping. 
The impervium cable undulated 
vulgarly. Some primitive fear of 
make symbols? his mind won- 
dered while panic crushed him. 

“Uncouple that cable!” the 
shout rang out. It was not his 
own. - 

A clean-cut young man with 
mouse-colored hair was moving 
toward the stubble-chinned, 
heavy-shouldered man quivering 
in the center of a web of imper- 
vium cables stuck secure to the 
walls and windows of buildings 
facing the street, the sidewalk, a 



mailbox, the lamp post and In- 
field. 

Mouse-hair yelled hoarsely, 
“Uncouple it, Davies! Can’t you 
see the guy’s got a lightning rod? 
You’re grounding him! 

“I can’t,” Davies groaned. “I’m 
scared!” 

Halfway down the twenty feet 
of cable. Mouse-hair grabbed on. 
“I’m holding it. Release it, you 
hear?” 

Davies fumbled for the broad 
belt around his thickening mid- 
dle. He jabbed the button that 
sent a negative current through 
the cable. The magnetic suction 
dart dropfjed away from Infield 
like a thing that had been alive 
and now was killed. He felt an 
overwhelming sense of relief. 

A fter breathing deeply for 
a few moments, he looked up 
to see Davies releasing and draw- 
ing all his darts into his belt, mak- 
ing it resemble a Hydra-sized 
spiked dog collar. Mouse-hair 
stood by tensely as the crowd 
d'sassembled. 

“This isn’t the first time you’ve 
pulled something like this, Da- 
vies,” he said. “You weren’t too 
scared to release that cable. You 
just don’t care about other peo- 
ple’s feelings. This is official.” 
Mouse-hair drove a fast, hard 
right into the soft blue flesh of 
Davies’ chin. The big man fell 
silently. 



NAME YOUR SYMPTOM 



33 



The other turned to Infield. 
“He was unconscious on his feet,” 
he explained. “He never knew he 
fell.” 

“What did you mean by that 
punch being official?” Infield 
asked while trying to arrange his 
feelings into the comfortable, fa- 
miliar patterns. 

The young man’s eyes almost 
seemed to narrow, although his 
face didn’t move; he merely ra- 
diated narrowed eyes. “How long 
have you been Cured?” 

“Not — not long,” Infield 
evaded. 

The other glanced around the 
street. He moistened his lips and 
spoke slowly. “Do you think you 
might be interested in joining a 
fraternal organization of the 
Cured?” 

Infield’s pulse raced, trying to 
get ahead of his thoughts, and 
losing out. A chance to study a 
pseudo-culture of the “Cured” 
developed in isolation! “Yes, I 
think I might. I owe you a drink 
for helping me out. How about 
it?” 

The man’s face paled so fast. 
Infield thought for an instant 
that he was going to faint. “All 
right. I’ll risk it.” He touched the 
side of his face away from the 
psychiatrist. 

Infield shifted around, trying to 
see that side of his benefactor, 
but couldn’t manage it in good 
grace. He wondered if the fellow 






was sporting a Mom-voice heaj 
ing aid and was afraid of raisin] 
her ire. He cleared his throat, no 
ticing the affectation of it. “Mj 
name’s Infield.” 

“Price,” the other answered ab. 
sently. “George Price. I suppose 
they have liquor at the Club. We 
can have a drink there, I guess."; 

Price set the direction and 
field fell m at his side. “Look, if 
you don’t drink. I’ll buy you a 
cup of coffee. It was just a sug- 
gestion.” 

TTNDER the mousy hair, 
Price’s strong features were 
beginning to gleam moistly. “You 
are lucky in one way, Mr. Infield. 
People take one look at your 
Cure and don’t ask you to go 
walking in the rain. But even 
after seeing this, some people 
still ask me to have a drink.” 
This was revealed, as he turned 
his head, to be a small metal 
cube above his left ear. 

Infield supposed it was a Cure, 
although he had never issued one 
like it. He didn’t know if it would 
be good form to inquire what 
kind it was. 

“It’s a cure for alcoholism,” 
Price told him. “It runs a constant 
blood check to see that the al- 
cohol level doesn’t go over the 
sobriety limit.” 

“What happens if you take one 
too many?” 

Price looked off as if at some- 



thing not particularly interesting, 

more interesting than what 
he was saying. “It drives a needle 
into my temple and kills me.” 

The psychiatrist felt cold fury 
rising in Wm- 

supposed to save lives, not en- 
danger them. 

“What kind of irresponsible 
idiot could have issued such a 
device?” he demanded angrily. 

“I did,” Price said. “I used to 
be a psychiatrist. I was always 
good in shop. This is a pretty 
effective mechanism, if I say so 
myself. It can’t be removed with- 
out causing my death and it’s in- 
destructible. Impervium-shielded, 
you see.” 

Price probably would never 
get crazed enough for liquor to 
kill himself. Infield knew. The 
threat of death would keep him 
constantly shocked sane. Men 
hide in the comforts of insanity, 
but when faced with death, they 
are often forced back to reality. 
A man can’t move his legs; in a 
fire, though, he may run. His legs 
were definitely paralyzed before 
and may be again, but for one 
moment he would forget the 
moral defeat of his life and his 
withdrawal from life and live an 
enforced sanity. But sometimes 
the withdrawal was — or could 
become — too complete. 

“We’re here.” 

Infield looked up self-con- 
sciously and noticed that they 

NAME YOUR SYMPTOM 

- aaaa:..- ^ 



had crossed two streets from his 
building and were standing in _ 
front of what appeared to be a 
small, dingy cafe. He followed 
Price through the screeching 
screen door. 

They seated themselves at a 
small table with a red-checked 
cloth. Infield wondered why 
cheap bars and restaurants al- 
ways used red-checked cloths. 
Then he looked closer and dis- 
covered the reason. They did a 
remarkably good job of camou- 
flaging the spots of grease and 
alcohol. 

A FAT man who smelled of the 
grease and alcohol of the 
tablecloths shuffled up to them 
with a towel on his arm, staring 
ahead of him at some point in 
time rather than space. 

Price lit a cigarette with un- 
steady hands. “Reggie is studying 
biblical text. Cute gadget. His 
contact lenses are made up a lot 
of layers of polarized glass. Every 
time he blinks, the amount of 
polarization changes and a new 
page appears. His father once 
told him that if he didn’t study 
his Bible and pray for him, his 
old dad would die.” 

The psychiatrist knew the 
threat on the father’s part couldn’t 
create such a fixation by itself. 
His eyebrows faintly inquired. 

Price nodded jerkily. “Twenty 
years ago, at least.” 



34 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



35 



“What’ll you have, Georgie?” 
Reggie asked. 

The young man snubbed out 
his cigarette viciously. “Bourbon. 
Straight.” 

Reggie smiled — a toothy, 
vacant, comedy-relief smile. “Fine. 
The Good Book says a little 
wine is good for a man, or some- 
thing like that. I don’t remember 
exactly.” 

Of course he didn’t. Infield 
knew. Why should he? It was 
useless to learn his Bible lessons 
to save his father, because it was 
obvious his father was dead. He 
would never succeed because 
there was no reason to succeed. 
But he had to try, didn’t he, for 
his father’s sake? He didn’t hate 
his father for making him study. 
He didn’t want him to die. He 
had to prove that. 

Infield sighed. At least this 
device kept the man on his feet, 
doing some kind of useful work 
instead of rotting in a padded cell 
with a probably imaginary Bible. 
A man could cut his wrists with 
the edge of a sheet of paper if 
he tried long enough, so of course 
the Bible would be imaginary. 

“But, Georgie,” the waiter com- 
plained, “you know you won’t 
drink it You ask me to bring you 
drinks and then you just look at 
them. Boy, do you look funny 
when you’re looking at drinks. 
Honest, Georgie, I want to laugh 
when I think of the way you 



look at a glass with a drink iij 
it.” He did laugh. 

Price fumbled with the cig, 
arette stub in the black iron ash. 
tray, examining it with the skill 
of scientific observation. “Mr. In- 
field is buying me the drink and 
that makes it different.” 

Reggie went away. Price kept 
dissecting the tobacco and paper. 
Infield cleared his throat and 
again reminded himself against 
such obvious affectations. “You 
were telling me about some or- 
ganization of the Cured,” he said 
as a reminder. 

T3RICE looked up, no longer in- 
terested in the relic of a 
cigarette. He was suddenly in- 
tensely interested and intensely 
observant of the rest of the cafe. 
“Was I? I was? Well, suppose you 
tell me something. What do you 
really think of the Incompletes?” 
The psychiatrist felt his face 
frown. “Who?” 

“I forgot. You haven’t been 
one of us long. The Incompletes 
is a truer name for the so-called 
Normals. Have you ever thought 
of just how dangerous these 
people are, Mr. Infield?” 

“Frankly, no,” Infield said, re- 
alizing it was not the right thing 
to say but tiring of constant 
pretense. 

“You don’t understand. Every- 
one has some little phobia or 
fixation. Maybe everyone didn’t 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



have one once, but after being 
told they did have them for 
generations, everyone who didn’t 
have one developed a defense 
mechanism and an aberration so 
they would be normal. If that 
phobia isn’t brought to the sur- 
face and Cured, it may arise any 
time and endanger other people. 
The only safe, good sound citizens 
are Cured. Those lacking Cures— 
the Incompletes — must be dealt 
with." 

Infield’s throat went dry. “And 
you’re the one to deal with them?” 

“It’s my Destiny.” Price quickly 
added, “And yours, too, of course.” 

Infield nodded. Price was a 
demagogue, young, handsome, dy- 
namic, likable, impassioned with 
his cause, and convinced that it 
was his divine destiny. He was 
a psychopathic egotist and a dan- 
gerous man. Doubly dangerous to 
Infield because, even though he 
was one of the few people who 
still read books from the old days 
of therapy to recognize Price for 
what he was, he nevertheless 
still liked the young man for the 
intelligence behind the egotism 
and the courage behind the fan- 
aticism. 

“How are we going to deal with 
the Incompletes?” Infield asked. 

Price started to glance around 
the cafe, then half-shrugged, al- 
most visibly thinking that he 
shouldn’t run that routine into 
the ground. “We’ll Cure them 



whether they want to be Cured 
or not — for their own good.” 
Infield felt cold inside. After 
a time, he found that the roaring 
was not just in his head. It was 
thundering outside. He was get- 
ting sick. Price was the type of 
man who could spread his ideas 
throughout the ranks of the 
Cured — if indeed the plot was 
not already universal, imposed 
upon many ill minds. 

H e could picture an entire- 
ly Cured world and he did- 
n’t like the view. Every Cure cut 
down on the mental and physical 
abilities of the patient as it was, 
whether Morgan and the others 
admitted it or not. But if every- 
one had a crutch to lean on for 
one phobia, he would develop 
secondary symptoms. 

People would start needing two 
Cures — perhaps a foetic gyro and 
a safety belt — then another and 
another. There would always be 
a crutch to lean on for one thing 
and then room enough to de- 
velop something else — until 
everyone would be loaded down 
with too many Cures to operate. 

A Cure was a last resort, dope 
for a malignancy case, euthanasia 
for the hopeless. Enforced Cures 
would be a curse for the individ- 
ual and the race. 

But Infield let himself relax. 
How could anyone force a me- 
chanical relief for neurotic or psy- 



NAME YOUR SYMPTOM 



37 



chopathic symptoms on someone 
who didn’t want or need it? 

“Perhaps you don’t see how it 
could be done,” Price said. “I’ll 
explain.” 

Reggie’s heavy hand sat a 
straight bourbon down before 
Price and another before Infield. 
Price stared at the drink almost 
without comprehension of how it 
came to be. He started to sweat. 

“George, drink it.” 

The voice belonged to a young 
woman, a blonde girl with pink 
skin and suave, draped clothes. 
In this den of the Cured, Infield 
thought half-humorously, it was 
surprising to see a Normal — an 
“Incomplete.” But then he noticed 
something about the baby she 
carried. The Cure had been very 
simple. It wasn’t even a mechan- 
ized half-human robot, just a 
rag doll. She sat down at the table. 

“George,” she said, “drink it. 
One drink won’t raise your al- 
cohol index to the danger point. 
You’ve got to get over this fear 
of even the sight or smell of li- 
quor.” 

The girl turned to Infield. 
“You’re one of us, but you’re new, 
so you don’t know about George. 
Maybe you can help if you do. 
It’s all silly. He’s not an alcoholic. 
He didn’t need to put that Cure 
on his head. It’s just an excuse for 
not drinking. All of this is just 
because a while back something 
happened to the baby here — ” 



she adjusted the doll’s blanket 
— “when he was drinking. Just 
drinking, not drunk. 

“I don’t remember what hap- 
pened to the baby — it wasn’t im- 
portant. But George has been 
brooding about it ever since. I 
guess he thinks something else 
bad will happen because of li- 
quor. That’s silly. Why don’t you 
tell him it’s silly?” 

“Maybe it is,” Infield said 
softly. “You could take the shock 
if he downed that drink and the 
shock might do you good.” 

T>RICE laughed shortly. “I feel 
like doing something very 
melodramatic, like throwing my 
drink — and yours — across the 
room, but I haven’t got the guts 
to touch those glasses. Do it for 
me, will you? Cauterizing the 
bite might do me good if I’d been 
bitten by a rabid dog, but I don’t 
have the nerve to do it.” 

Before Infield could move, Reg- 
gie came and set both drinks on 
a little circular tray. He moved 
away. “I knew it. That’s all he 
did, just look at the drink. Makes 
me laugh.” 

Price wiped the sweat off his 
palms. Infield sat and thought. 
Mrs. Price cooed to the rag doll, 
unmindful of either of them now. 

“You were explaining,” the psy- 
chiatrist said. “You were going to 
tell me how you were going to 
Cure the Incompletes.”

“I said we were going to do it. 
Actually you will play a greater 
part than I, Doctor Infield.” 

The psychiatrist sat rigidly. 
“You didn’t think you could 
give me your right name in front 
of your own office building and 
that I wouldn’t recognize you? I 
know some psychiatrists are sen- 
sitive about wearing Cures them- 
selves, but it is a mark of honor 
of the completely sane man. You 
should be proud of your Cure and 
eager to Cure others. Very eager.” 

“Just what do you mean?” He 
already suspected Price’s mean- 
ing. 

Price leaned forward. “There 
is one phobia that is so wide- 
spread, a Cure is not even thought 
of — hypochondria. Hundreds of 
people come to your office for a 
Cure and you turn them away. 
Suppose you and the other Cured 
psychiatrists give everybody who 
comes to you a Cure?” 

Infield gestured vaguely. “A 
psychiatrist wouldn’t hand out 
Cures unless they were absolutely 
necessary.” 

“You’ll feel differently after 
you’ve been Cured for a while 
yourself. Other psychiatrists 
have.” 

Before Infield could speak, a 
stubble-faced, barrel-chested man 
moved past their table. He wore 
a safety belt. It was the man 
Price had called Davies, the one 
who had fastened one of his safe- 

NAME YOUR SYMPTOM 



ty lines to Infield in the street. 

Davies went to the bar in the 
back. “Gimme a bottle,” he de- 
manded of a vacant-eyed Reg- 
gie. He came back toward them, 
carrying the bottle in one hand, 
brushing off rain drops with the 
other. He stopped beside Price 
and glared. Price leaned back. 
The chair creaked. Mrs. Price 
kept cooing to the doll. 

“You made me fall,” Davies ac- 
cused. 

Price shrugged. “You were un- 
conscious. You never knew it.” 

Sweat broke out on Davies’ 
forehead. “You broke the Code. 
Don’t you think I can imagine 
how it was to fall? You louse!” 

S UDDENLY, Davies triggered 
his safety belt. At close range, 
before the lines could fan out in 
a radius, all the lines in front at- 
tached themselves to Price, the 
ones at each side clung to their 
table and the floor, and all the 
others to the table behind Infield. 
Davies released all lines except 
those on Price, and then threw 
himself backward, dragging Price 
out of his chair and onto the 
floor. Davies didn’t mind making 
others fall. They were always try- 
ing to make him fall just so they 
could laugh at him or pounce on 
him; why shouldn’t he like to 
make them fall first? 

Expertly, Davies moved for- 
ward and looped the loose lines 

39 



around Price’s head and shoulders 
and then around his feet. He 
crouched beside Price and shoved 
the bottle into the gasping mouth 
and poured. 

Price twisted against the bind- 
ing lines in blind terror, gagging 
and spouting whiskey. Davies 
laughed and tilted the bottle 
more. 

Mrs. Price screamed. “The 
Cure! If you get that much li- 
quor in his system, it will kill 
him!” She rocked the rag doll in 
her arms, trying to soothe it, and 
stared in horror. 

Infield hit the big man behind 
the ear. He dropped the bottle 
and fell over sideways on the 
floor. Fear and hate mingled in 
his eyes as he looked up at In- 
field. 

Nonsense, Infield told himself. 
Eyes can’t register emotion. 

Davies released his lines and 
drew them in. He got up pre- 
cariously. “I’m going to kill you,” 
he said, glaring at Infield. “You 
made me fall worse than Georgia 
did. I’m really going to kill you.” 

Infield wasn’t a large man, but 
he had pressed two hundred and 
fifty many times in gym. He grab- 
bed Davies’ belt with both hands 
and lifted him about six inches 
off the floor. 

“I could drop you,” the psy- 
chiatrist said. 

“No!” Davies begged weakly. 
“Please!” 



“I’ll do it if you cause more 
trouble.” Infield sat down and 
rubbed his aching forearms. 

IT^AVIES backed off in terror, 
right into the arms of Reg- 
gie. The waiter closed his huge 
hands on the acrophobe’s shoul- 
ders. 

“You broke the Code all the 
way,” Reggie said. “The Good 
Book says ‘Thou shouldn’t kill’ 
or something like that, and so 
does the Code.” 

“Let him go, Reggie,” Price 
choked out, getting to his feet. 
“I’m not dead.” He wiped his 
hand across his mouth. 

“No. No, you aren’t.” Infield 
felt an excitement pounding 
through him, same as when he 
had diagnosed his first case. No, 
better than that. 

“That taste of liquor didn’t kill 
you. Price. Nothing terrible hap- 
pened. You could find some way 
to get rid of that Cure.” 

Price stared at him as if he were 
a padded-cell case. “That’s differ- 
ent. I’d be a hopeless drunk with- 
out the Cure. Besides, no one ever 
gets rid of a Cure.” 

They were all looking at In- 
field. Somehow he felt this rep- 
resented a critical point in his- 
tory. It was up to him which turn 
the world took, the world as rep- 
resented by these four Cured 
people. “I’m afraid I’m for less 
Cures instead of more. Price. 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Look, if I can show you that some- 
one can discard a Cure, would 
you get rid of that — if I may use 
word — monstrous thing on 

your head?” 

Price grinned. Infield didn’t rec- 
ognize its smugness at the time. 

“I’ll show you.” He took off 
the circlet with the lightning rod 
and yanked at the wire running 
down into his collar. The new-old 
excitement within was running 
high. He felt the wire snap and 
come up easily. He threw the 
Cure on the floor. 

“Now,” he said, “I am going 
out in that rain storm. There’s 
thunder and lightning out there. 
I’m afraid, but I can get along 
without a Cure and so can you.” 
“You can’t! Nobody can!” 
Price screamed after him. He 
turned to the others. “If he re- 
veals us, the Cause is lost. We’ve 
got to stop him for good. We’ve 
got to go after him.” 

“It’s slippery,” Davies whim- 
pered. “I might fall.” 

Mrs. Price cuddled her rag doll. 
“I can’t leave the baby and she 
mustn’t get wet.” 

“Well, there’s no liquor out 
there and you can study your text 
in the lightning flashes, Reggie. 
Come on.” 

R unning down the streets 
that were tunnels of shining 
tar, running into the knifing ice 
bristles of the rain, Henry Infield 

NAME YOUR SYMPTOM 



realized that he was very fright- 
ened of the lightning. 

There is no action without a 
reason, he knew from the old neg- 
lected books. He had had a la- 
tent fear of lightning when he 
chose the lightning rod Cure. He 
could have picked a safety belt 
or foetic gyro just as well. 

He sneezed. He was soaked 
through, but he kept on running. 
He didn’t know what Price and 
Reggie planned to do when they 
caught him. He slipped and fell. 
He would soon find out what they 
wanted. The excitement was all 
gone now and it left an empty 
space into which fear rushed. 

Reggie said, “We shall make 
a sacrifice.” 

Infield looked up and saw the 
lightning reflected on the blade 
of a thin knife. Infield reached 
toward it more in fascination than 
fear. He managed to get all his 
fingers around two of Reggie’s. 
He jerked and the knife fell into 
Infield’s palm. The psychiatrist 
pulled himself erect by holding 
to Reggie’s arm. Staggering to his 
feet, he remembered what he 
must do and slashed at the 
waiter’s head. A gash streaked 
across the man’s brow and blood 
poured into his eyes. He screamed. 
“I can’t see the words!” 

It was his problem. Infield 
usually solved other people’s 
problems, but now he ran away— 
he couldn’t even solve his own. 

41 



Infield realized that he had 
gone mad as he held the thin 
blade high overhead, but he did 
need some kind of lightning rod. 
Price (who was right behind him, 
gaining) had been right. No one 
could discard a Cure. He watched 
the lightning play its light on the 
blade of his Cure and he knew 
that Price was going to kill him 
in the next moment. 

He was wrong. 

The lightning hit him first. 

T> EGGIE squinted under the 
bandage at the lettering on 
the door that said INFIELD 8g 
MORGAN and opened the door. 
He ran across the room to the 
man sitting at the desk, reading 
by the swivel light. 

“Mr. Morgan, your partner, Mr. 
Infield, he — ” 

“Just a moment.” Morgan 
switched on the room lights. 
“What were you saying?” 

“Mr. Infield went out without 
his Cure in a storm and was 
struck by lightning. We took him 



to the morgue. He must have 
been crazy to go out without his 
Cure.” 

Morgan stared into his bright 
desk light without blinking. “This 
is quite a shock to me. Would 
you mind leaving? I’ll come over 
to your place and you can tell 
me about it later.” 

Reggie went out. “Yes, sir. He 
was struck by lightning, struck 
dead.-He must have been crazy 
to leave his Cure ...” The door 
closed. 

Morgan exhaled. Poor Infield. 
But it wasn’t the lightning that 
killed him, of course. Morgan ad- 
justed the soundproofing plugs in 
his ears, thinking that you did 
have to have quite a bit of light 
to read lips. The thunder, natur- 
ally, was what had killed Infield. 
Loud noise — any noise — that 
would do it every time. Too bad 
Infield had never really stopped 
being one of the Incompletes. 
Dangerous people. He would have 
to deal with them.

T hough stories of sci- 
entific discoveries never 
repeat precisely, they of- 
ten have such a pronounced pat-

one thinks that it is a retelling 
of another and it can happen 
that the mind is lulled into a 
kind of carelessness by the simi- 
larities and experiences a sur-

a different turn. As a case in 
point, I offer the stories of two

rather old, having occurred in the 
period from 1870 to 1895. The 
other is recent, so recent that it 
is, in fact, still current 

The first story began with the 
fact that a man was tired of 
farming. He was William Forster, 
who had owned a farm near the 
Burnett River in Queensland, 
Australia, for a number of years, 
but had retired and moved to 
Sydney. One day in 1869, he de- 
cided to pass the time at the 
Sydney Museum. There he saw 
specimens of all the unusual ani- 
mals of Australia with which he 
was familiar. But there was some- 
thing missing and he fell to talk- 
ing about it with Gerard Krefft, 
the curator of the museum. Mr. 
Forster asked why the museum 
did not show the big fish that 
lived in the Burnett River. 

pERARD KREFFT admitted 
that he did not know any- 
thing about a big fish in the Bur- 
nett River, but thought it quite 
likely that the museum might 
have specimens — not yet on ex- 
hibit, possibly — from other lo- 
calities. He asked Forster to de- 
scribe it and Forster did his best. 

The fish was around five feet 
long and greenish in color, with 
a white belly, and had unusually 
large scales. It did not have a 
tail like other fish but more like 
an eel. Come to think of it, the 
shape of the body was alsp like 

44 



that of an eel, a very fat eel, 
about as thick as a man’s thigh. 
And it had four strong fins. Mr. 
Forster was certain about that, 
even though Mr. Keffrt had nev- 
er heard about a fish with only 
four fins. 

Forster added that the fish was 
edible. The white squatters in 
the area actually called it the 
Burnett salmon, while the natives 
had a name like barramundi. (In 
that Mr. Forster was wrong. The 
natives did have a name for the 
fish he had in mind, but it was 
dyelleh. Barramundi was the na- 
tive name for an entirely differ- 
ent fish.) 

The discussion ended with a 
promise by Mr. Forster to write 
to his cousin, who had taken over 
the farm, and ask him to send a 
few Burnett salmon to Mr. Krefft. 

Early in 1870, a barrel arrived 
at the museum. It contained sev- 
eral Burnett salmon, strongly 
salted as a preservative against 
the heat of the southern-hemi- 
sphere summer. Curator Krefft 
pulled one of the specimens from 
the barrels and hefted it onto a 
table; the Burnett salmon proved 
to be a heavyweight. 

He saw that William Forster 
had delivered a rather good de- 
scription of the external charac- 
teristics. An expert would have 
done better only by attaching the 
proper technical terms to some 
of the external appendages. He 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



r 

would have called the pointed 
fringe of fin material around the 
rear end a Diphyceral Tail (pro- 
nounced with capitals out of re- 
spect for its rarity) and he would 
have emphasized that the four 
fins were living examples of an 
up to that moment only theoreti- 
cal concept, namely the archip- 
terygitim of Professor Karl Geg- 
enbauer. 

It was, in short, a limb which 
could evolve into a fish’s fin or 
else could become an amphibian’s 
leg. 

Krefft then looked into the 
mouth of the creature and stated 
later that he did not believe his 
eyes. There were very few but 
very large teeth in this mouth, 
each one looking as if a set of 
teeth had grown together, and 
reminding the onlooker of the 
comb of a rooster. 

Such teeth had been known as 
fossils, but nobody had been 
quite sure which kind of early 
fish had grown them; general sus- 
picion centered around an an- 
cient shark. The extinct fish to 
which these teeth once belonged 
had been called Ceratodus, or 
“horn-tooth.” Now it was clear 
that it had not been a shark. 

When Krefft dissected the fish, 
he found that, in addition to the 
normal gills, it also had a sin- 
gle lung. It was the fish that 
got into all the books as the Aus- 
tralian Lungfish, a veritable liv- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



ing fossil from the Middle Age 
of fish history. 

K refft was so over- 
whelmed by the find that 
he did not even think it proper 
to give it another scientific name 
than the one attached to the fos- 
sil. He called it Ceratodus For- 
steri, adding, as is customary, his 
own name. 

Since then, pretty complete 
specimens of the fossil Ceratodus 
have been found. It turned out 
that the fossils of several hundred 
million years ago and the living 
form were not quite the same, so 
the Latin word for “new” was 
tacked on in front of the name 
and it became Neoceratodus For- 
steri Krefft. 

What had to be done next was 
to investigate the living fossil in 
the living state. Two one-man ex- 
peditions set out for the Burnett 
River to do just that. One con- 
sisted of Professor Spencer of 
Melbourne, who just spent his 
vacation on the project. The other 
one was Professor Richard Semon 
of Jena, Germany, who had trav- 
eled half-way around the Earth 
for the purpose, backed by the 
money of the Swiss manufacturer 
Karl Ritter. 

Professor Semon, a direct pu- 
pil of Ernst Haeckel, was suc- 
cessful where Spencer was not, 
simply because Neoceratodus 
steadfastly refused to lay eggs 



45 



until after Professor Spencer’s 
vacation was over. But Professor 
Semon’s studies were interrupted, 
too, one day. No more eggs, no 
more fish within reach. The rea- 
son? The natives had eaten them! 

Professor Semon had to wait 
for a full year — ^which he spent 
on islands between Australia and 
New Zealand — until the mating 
time of Neocera f odus came round 
again. Then, with natives who 
had been very strongly warned 
against eating the fish, he offered 
what to them were enormous re- 
wards for bringing in the fish, and 
especially the eggs, alive. Ob- 
serving the development of an 
individual lungfish from its egg 
would shed much light on the 
evolution of the species in the 
past. 

It had been obvious all along 
that the lungfishes — there are 
three: one in South America, one 
in Africa and one in Australia, 
the Australian form being the 
largest and the most typical — 
were somewhere near the point 
where, in the distant past, the 
marine vertebrates, the fishes, 
had gone on land to become am- 
phibians. But what had gone be- 
fore? Where did the lungfishes 
fit in with the other fishes? 

Mostly with the aid of fossils, 
the story could be reconstructed. 
The earliest known fishes, from 
the late Silurian and early De- 
vonian period of 350 million 



years ago, were a strange lot. 
They were small, just a few 
inches long. Their organ of loco- 
motion was their tail exclusively 
for there were no other fins. 
They also had no jaws and con- 
sequently no teeth. But they were 
heavily armored, with plate ar- 
mor in front and scales over the 
tail section. Their main and pos- 
sibly only enemy must have been 
the gigantic sea scorpions (eu- 
rypterids) of the same time, 
which were a good ten feet in 
length. No living representative 
of this type is left. 

l^UT SOME of these early 
fishes managed to become 
something else, presumably by 
leaving the river and going into 
the open sea. They developed 
jaws and paired fins and lost 
their armor, and speed became 
their protective device. We all 
know this type: the selachians, 
sharks in everyday English. 

That they were an inherently 
successful development is shown 
by the fact that they are still 
with us, although the bad repu- 
tation of a few of them has con- 
fused the picture. The number of 
surviving species of sharks (and 
of rays, which are also selachi- 
ans) is small and the number of 
individuals, too. Moreover, with 
a very few exceptions, the living 
forms are all rather recent types. 

Above the sharks, we get two 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



main lines. One of them consti- 
mtes the endless multitudes of 
tjje living true, or bony, fishes. 
Another line led through an in- 
termediary group to the first am- 
phibians; the lungfishes are a 
group which branched off this in- 
termediary group. They were 
near, but not in, the line of evo- 
lution of the amphibians and 
managed to survive mostly by 
being able to endure conditions 
which neither true fishes nor am- 
phibians could tolerate. 

The name of the intermediary 
group from which both the lung- 
fishes and the amphibians came 
is crossopterygians. In English, 
this is translated as “lobe-fins.” 
The Germans are more careful 
when it comes to the translation 
of the Greek word krossoi and 
call them QuastenfJosser or “tas- 
sel-fins.” An especially vigorously 
flourishing tribe of the lobe-fins 
were the coelacanths (“hollow 
spines”) with large heads, strong, 
almost limblike, fins and a curi- 
ous double tail. They started 
later in the Devonian period, 
lived through the Carboniferous 
and the Permian periods and all 
through the three periods of the 
great reptiles, Triassic, Jurassic 
and Cretaceous, but becoming 
rarer and rarer as time went on. 
They petered out near the end 
of the Cretaceous period and the 
last of the crossopterygians was 
Mactopotna Mantelli. 



It so happened that Macro- 
poma was the first fossil of a - 
crossopterygian ever discovered. 
Sir Arthur Smith Woodward 
carefully reconstructed it. 

M y second fish story begins 
by reporting that a river 
called Chalumna empties into 
the ocean on the southeast coast 
of Africa, near a town called East 
London. Late in 1938, a trawler 
with a load of fish berthed in 
New London. Its captain phoned 
the curator of the local museum, 
Miss M. Courtnay Latimer, told 
her that he had caught a very 
curious fish, and maybe she 
would like to come to the wharf 
to look at it. Miss Latimer did 
and saw at first glance that, what- 
ever it was, it was very curious, 
just as the captain had said. 

There was an unwieldy fish 
with an enormous head, steel 
blue in color, with large blue 
eyes, large scales and peculiar 
fins. It was a little over five feet 
in length and, though the captain 
of the trawler did not know its 
name, he did know its weight: 
127 pounds. He also remembered 
details of the catch. 

It had been caught not very 
far offshore on December 22nd, 
1938, with a trawler net — other 
contents: one and a half tons of 
shark and half a ton of redfish 
and kobs — in 40 fathoms of wa- 
ter. It had lived for three hours

after capture and had tried to 
bite the hand of the captain as 
he bent over to see whether it 
was alive. 

The trawler captain had 
termed it a very curious fish. 
Miss Latimer spoke of it as a 
very primitive fish when she in- 
formed Dr. James Leonard Bri- 
erley Smith, ichthyologist at 
Rhodes University, Grahams- 
town. South Africa. 

Dr. Smith hurried to East Lon- 
don, but meanwhile nature had 
taken its course. The trawler had 
not returned to shore immedi- 
ately after this catch. Miss Lati- 
mer probably wrote at once, but 
time went by between her first 
look at the fish and Dr. Smith’s 
arrival. And it was summer in 
the southern hemisphere. Miss 
Latimer had been forced to order 
the fish skinned and the skin 
mounted. She did save the skull, 
too, and the rest had to be thrown 
away. 

But although all the internal 
and interesting parts were miss- 
ing, Dr. Smith saw that it was a 
coelacanthl 

To honor Miss Latimer, who 
had saved what could be saved, 
he called it Latimeria and wrote 
down, for the journal The Cape 
Naturalist, the precise classifica- 
tion: Class: Pisces; Subclass:' 

Crossopterygii; Order: Actinis- 

tia; Family: Coelacanthidae; Ge- 
nus: Latimeria; Species: chalum-

nae, and added: “the genus and 
the species are new to science.” 

This was one of those major 
understatements which are occa- 
sionally made by people who 
want to avoid being called en- 
thusiastic, for it was the biggest 
discovery in the whole natural 
history field since the finding of 
Neoceratodus. 

A live brontosaurus in Lake 
Victoria would have been more 
spectacular, of course, but of 
lesser scientific interest. It cer- 
tainly would have involved us, 
the observers, less because Lati- 
meria chalumnae J. L. B. Smith 
is a representative of what con- 
stituted our own ancestry and a 
brontosaurus is not. 

T>UT THEN came a period of 
long frustration, for the Sec- 
ond World War was on. Fishing 
for food continued as usual, but 
the specimen off the mouth of 
the Chalumna River was evident- 
ly a stray. 

It is said that Dr. Smith, dur- 
ing the war years, asked his wife 
in the middle of the night, “Do 
you think Latimeria lives in the 
Mozambique Channel?” (the wa- 
ter separating Madagascar from 
Africa) and I, for one, am in- 
clined to believe this story; I 
have done similar things myself. 
Life would have been much eas- 
ier for Dr. Smith if he had known 
where Latimeria lived. Since he

didn’t, he had to consider an 
enormous area. 

The three languages spoken on 
the coastline of Africa are, going 
from south to north: English, 
Portuguese and French. Dr. 
Smith had pamphlets printed in 
large numbers in these three lan- 
guages, offering a reward of £100 
for a specimen. 

He made collecting trips him- 
self and, in December, 1952, had 
just come to Durban Harbor, 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



South Africa, with many speci- 
mens of other fish, when he re- 
ceived a message from a trader 
plying the ocean between the 
African mainland and the Como- 
res Islands: Grande Comore, Mo- 
heli, Anjouan and Mayotte. Trad- 
er Eric Hunt reported that he 
had a second specimen! 

Dr. Smith, worried that it 
might decay like the first before 
he got there, telephoned Daniel 
F. Malan, the Prime Minister of

the Union of South Africa, plead- 
ing for an airplane and pilot. 

Prime Minister Malan is a 
champipn of Apaartheid (segre- 
gation) and thinks that evolution 
IS a question of belief instead of 
knowledge. Moreover, the tele- 
phone call arrived at midnight, 
when he was asleep. 

In spite of all this. Dr. Smith 
won his point— the Prime Min- 
ister ordered at once that a Da- 
kota plane (DC-3) and a mili- 
tary pilot be placed at Dr. Smith’s 
disposition. He was flown to 
Trader Hunt’s ship. High emo- 
tional strain and lack of sleep 
combined to put Dr. Smith’s 
nerves on edge;' when he saw the 
wrapped fish on board the small 
ship, he had to ask others to re- 
move the wrappings for him. 
There was a large blue coela- 
canth with large blue eyes, with 
catlike teeth in its jaws — and it 



was undecayed! 

Dr. Smith knelt down on the 
deck and wept. 

CPECIMEN NO. 2 had been 
caught by a native, Ahmed 
Hussein, 200 yards off the island 
of Anjouan in 65 feet of water. 
The fish had struggled so hard 
that Ahmed Hussein had to bash 
Its head in. The next morning, he 
took It to market, but before 
somebody else of equal ignorance 
bought It for soup, another native 
recognized it as the fish which 
was worth three years of normal 
income. The lucky fisherman and 
his canny informant lugged the 
fish over 25 miles of mountainous 
terrain to Trader Hunt’s vessel. 

Hunt, who had been handing 
out Dr. Smith’s leaflets himself, 
sent a cable to the scientist, then 
sliced open the fish’s sides and 
packed them with salt. After that.

he found a medical officer, bor- 
rowed a S37ringe and five liters of 
formalin and injected them into 
the fish. 

Dr. Smith now had the mate- 
rial to decide the two questions 
most important from the scien- 
tific standpoint: How were the 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



jaws formed? And had the coel- 
acanths progressed to the point of 
having livers? 

En passant, he collected some 
information from the natives of 
the Comores Islands. They all 
knew the fish, which was brought 
to market occasionally. Their 

51 




own name for it was combessa. 
Its flesh turned into jelly when it 
was boiled. And, when alive, its 
eyes were luminous. 

After examining Specimen No. 
2 some more. Dr. Smith felt that 
this was a different species from 
No. 1. And so it happened that 
the anti-evolutionist Prime Min- 
ister had this fish named after 
him — it became Malania an- 
jouanae, “Malan’s fish from An- 
jouan.” 

Science did not have to wait 
for another dozen years for Spe- 
cimen No. 3. It was killed by 
Houmadi Hassani off Anjouan 
in 650 feet of water on Septem- 
ber 24, 1953. It was a smaller 
fish, weighing only 88 pounds, 
and it was brown with white 
spots. Because of this coloration, 
Houmadi Hassani’s assertion that 
he had the fish was not believed 
at first, but a few hours after 
death, it turned blue. 

It was flown in an old Junkers 
plane to Madagascar, for in the 
meantime. Professor James Mil- 
lot in Paris had informed French 
officialdom about the scientific 
rarity in French waters, since 
both the Comores and Madagas- 
car are French possessions. In 
fact. Professor Millot was wait- 
ing in Madagascar; he was not 
going to miss a chance to have a 
go at the next specimen that 
showed up. And he soon made a 
few scientific pronouncements. 



The coelacanth apparently 
showed a very unusual amount 
of individual variation, in colora- 
tion as well as in placements of 
the fins. Hence Dr. Smith’s new 
species, based on such minor dif. 
ferences, was unfounded. They 
were all Latimeria chalumnae. 

Specimen No. 4 was taken near 
Grande Comore, the main island 
of the group, on January 29, 
1954. In the morning of January 
30th, Specimen No. 5 was 
brought in and, a few hours later. 
Specimen No. 6. But there was 
a wait of ten months for No. 7. 

The scientists, especially the 
French, were overjoyed with the 
development, but they mourned 
one fact. One couldn’t be sure 
about the very first specimen be- 
cause so little of it was left, but 
all the others had been males. 

A S IN the case of Neoceratodus, 
the scientific desire for iish 
eggs grew to outrageous propor- 
tions. Furthermore, six good spec- 
imens were enough to learn all 
about the anatomy of this sur- 
vivor from the period preceding 
the so-called Age of Reptiles. 
Now one had to observe the live 
fish if one wanted more informa- 
tion. 

The French had matched Dr. 
Smith’s reward of one hundred 
pounds sterling all along and had 
paid it to the lucky fishermen — 
with public ceremonies. Now 



doubled the prize, but it 
jiad to be a live specimen to rate 

the bigger award. ^ ^ 

gpecinien No. 8 was brought 
in on November 12, 1954, by two 
fishermen, Zema ben Said Mo- 
hamed and Madi Bacari. The fish 
struck at a depth of 840 feet and 
it took more than half an hour 
to haul it in. Specimen No. 8 was 



to be a female. 

There was dancing all night in 
the village. The specimen was 
put in a swamped boat resting 
on the bottom in very shallow 
water and a fish net was stretched 
over the boat so that the catch 
could not escape. And anybody 
could see that the natives had 
told the truth all along: the eyes 
of the fish glowed strongly with 
a greenish-yellow light. The color 
of the live specimen was a very 
dark gray-blue. As it swam slowly 
about in its confined space, the 
pectoral fins made “curious ro- 
tating movements,” to use Pro- 



fessor Millot’s words. 

Millot continued: “. the sec- 
ond dorsal and anal fins, likewise 
very mobile, served together with 
the tail as a rudder. After day- 
break it became apparent that 
the light, and above all the sun 
itself, was upsetting the animal 
very much, so several tent can- 
vases were put over the boat to 
serve as some kind of protection. 
But despite this precaution and 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



the more or less constant renewal 
of the water, the fish began to 
show more and more obvious 
signs of distress, seeking to con- 
ceal itself in the darkest corners 
... at 14:45 hr. it was still swim- 
ming feebly; but at 15:30 hr. it 
had its belly in the air and only 
the fins and gill covers were mak- 
ing agonized movements.” 

Specimen No. 8, four feet and 
nearly eight inches long and 
weighing almost precisely 90 
pounds, had lived for about 20 
hours, counting from the moment 
of its striking the baited hook. 
Unfortunately, the fish did not 
carry any eggs. But quoting Mil- 
lot once more: 

“Two principal conclusions 
emerge from the corroborated 
statements made by local observ- 
ers and myself: (1) the extreme 
photophobia of Latimeria — the 
sunlight seemed literally to hi^ 
it; (2) the exceptional mobility 
of the pecundulate fins, correlated 
with the wealth of musculature 
which is revealed by anatomical 
studies. The pectorals, in particu- 
lar, can move in almost any direc- 
tion and show themselves capable 
of assuming practically every 
conceivable position.” 

B ecause of the sensitivity 
to sunlight, an “aquarium” 
for Latimeria will probably have 
to take the shape of a wire-net 
cage at the bottom of the sea. 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



53 



at least 200 feet below the sur- 
face, which can be lifted to, say, 
30 feet from time to time to 
enable scientists in aqualungs to 
study the fish and take photo- 
graphs. 

Professor Millot has promised 
that “all about Latimeria” will be 
told in a foxir-volume work now 
in preparation. But the last vol- 
ume of this work will certainly 
not be sent to the printer until 
a few more things have been 
done. 

One is to observe mating and 
spawning, if at all possible. If 
that does not work out, the scien- 
tists want to have at least one 
bunch of eggs which can be 
hatched and a few yoimg will 
then be killed off for careful dis- 
section at intervals of a few days. 
Richard Semon did that with 
Neoceratodus eggs. 

The comparison between the 
two should be most interesting 
and enlightening. Since the young 
in their early stages always re- 
semble their ancestors, such a 
study may teach us just where 
Latimeria ties in with fossil forms 
and possibly even enable us to 
arrange the fossil forms in an evo- 
lutionary sequence. 

Another observation that 
would be of the greatest interest 
would be to find where the fish 
actually lives. The first specimen 
was evidently a stray, because 
all the others were taken in the 



vicinity of the Comores Islands 
— usually, but not always, in 
fairly deep water. If one could 
establish where the fish lives, it 
could be a clue for its survival in 
just this area. If they prefer caves 
it might also be that the biggest 
specimen stay in their caves. 

The first one, weighing 127 
poimds, is also the largest one so 
far. Most of the others weighed 
100 pounds or less. But the na- 
tives swear that in the past, when 
nobody yet cared, specimens 
weighing 225 pounds were 
brought to market once in a while. 

Finally, it is not established 
that the fish lives only near the 
Comores Islands. It has not yet 
been fotmd near the Cosmoledo 
Islands, or near the Seychelles 
Islands, some distance to the 
northeast from the Cosmoledos. 
On the other hand, nobody has 
been strenuously looking around 
these islands and we have seen 
that, in spite of strenuous looking, 
many years passed between Spec- 
imen No. 1 and No. 2. 

Moreover, such living fossils 
have a habit of surviving in 
widely separated areas, a fact 
that can be easily explained. 
Originally they had a worldwide 
distribution and then managed to 
hang on in a few places, becoming 
extinct in the in-between areas. 

Marsupials, for example, sur- 
vived mainly in Australia. But 
they also live in the Americas.

k NOTHER LIVING fossil, just 
iV as old as Latimeria and Neo~ 
ceratodas, the horseshoe crab sur- 
vives along the Atlantic shores 
of the United States. The only 
other place it can be found is in 
the waters around the Moluccas 
on the other side of the Earth. 
The point Fm leading up to is 
that there is a little bit of very 
feeble evidence for a primitive 
fish of large size in the Gulf of 
Mexico. 

In 1949, a woman in or near 
Tampa, Florida, ran a small shop 
selling souvenirs to tourists. She 
made many of them herself and 
her raw material consisted often 
of fish scales, which she bought 
from local fishermen. One day in 
1949, a fisherman sold her a gal- 
lon can full of scales. They had 
the same size as the scales of a 
large tarpon — about that of a sil- 
ver dollar — but they looked dif- 
ferent. 

Being curious, she mailed one 
of the scales to the National Mu- 
seum in Washington, D. C., where 
it was passed on to the fish expert. 
Dr. Isaac Ginsburg. Dr. Ginsburg 
knew several things instantly: 

One: he had never seen such a 
scale before. Two: no fish with 
such scales was known to live in 
the Gulf of Mexico. Three: there 
had never been even a rumor of 
a large unknown fish from those 
waters. Finally: the fish which 
grew this scale was a very primi- 



tive type, possibly a crossoptery- 
gian. 

He at once wrote to Tampa re- 
questing information on the 
whereabouts of more scales, the 
place where the fisherman had 
been fishing, the appearance of 
the fish from which the scales 
were taken. He never received 
a reply. 

Nothing is known, therefore, 
except that there must be some- 
thing unusual in the Gulf. We 
may get still a third fish story of 
the type of the two just told, right 
in our own waters.

With never o moment to rostf tho pursuit 
through space felt like a game of hounds 
and hares ... or was it follow the leader? 



By EDWARD W. LUDWIG 
Illustrated by EMSH 




B en CURTIS eased his 
pale, gaunt body through 
the open doorway of the 
Blast Inn, the dead man follow- 
ing silently behind him. 

His fear-borne gaze traveled 
into the dimly illumined Venu- 
sian gin mill. The place was like 
an evil caldron steaming with a 
brew whose ingredients had been 
culled from the back corners of 
three planets. 

Most of the big room lay ob- 
scured behind a shimmering veil 
of tobacco smoke and the sweet, 
heavy fumes of Martian Devil’s 
Egg. Here and there, Ben saw 
moving figures. He could not tell 
if they were Earthmen, Martians 
or Venusians. 

Someone tugged at his greasy 
coat. He jumped, thinking ab- 
surdly that it was the dead man’s 
hand. 

“Coma esta, senor?” a small

voice piped. “Speken die 
Deutsch? Desirez-vous d’amoui? 
Da? Nyet?” 

Ben looked down. 

The speaker was an eager-eyed 
Martian boy of about ten. He was 
like a red-skinned marionette 
with pipestem arms and legs, clad 
in a torn skivvy shirt and faded 
blue dungarees. 

“I’m American,” Ben muttered. 

“Ah, buena! I speak English 
ires fine, senor. I have Martian 
friend, she tres pretty and tres 
fat. She weigh almost eighty 
pounds, monsieur. I take you to 
her, si?” 

Ben shook his head. 

TTE THOUGHT, I don’t want 
your Martian wench. I don’t 
want your opium or your Devil’s 
Egg or your Venusian kali. But if 
you had a drug thafd bring a 
dead man to life, I’d buy and pay 
with my soul. 

“It is deal, monsieur? Five dol- 
lars or twenty keelis for visit 
Martian friend. Maybe you like 
House of Dreams. For House of 
Dreams — ” 

“I’m not buying.” 

The dirty-faced kid shrugged. 
“Then I show you to good table, 
— tres bien. I do not charge you, 
senor.” 

The boy grabbed his hand. Be- 
cause Ben could think of no rea- 
son for resisting, he followed. 
They plunged into shifting layers 



of smoke and through the drone 
of alcohol-cracked voices. 

They passed the bar with its 
line of lean-featured, slit-eyed 
Earthmen — merchant space- 
men. 

They wormed down a nar- 
row aisle flanked by booths 
carved from Venusian marble 
that jutted up into the semi-dark- 
ness like fog-blanketed tomb- 
stones. 

Several times, Ben glimpsed 
the bulky figures of CO^-breath- 
ing Venusians, the first he’d ever 
seen. 

They were smoky gray, scaly, 
naked giants, toads in human 
shape. They stood solitary and 
motionless, aloof, their green- 
lidded eyes unblinking. They cer- 
tainly didn’t look like telepaths, 
as Ben had heard they were, but 
the thought sent a fresh rivulet of 
fear down his”spine. 

Once he spied a white-uni- 
formed officer of Hoover City’s 
Security Police. The man was 
striding down an aisle, idly tap>- 
ping his neuro-club against the 
stone booths. 

Keep walking, Ben told him- 
self. You look the same as anyone 
else here. Keep walking. Look 
straight ahead. 

The officer passed. Ben 
breathed easier. 

“Here we are, monsieur” piped 
the Martian boy. “A tres fine 
table. Close in the shadows.” 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Ben winced. How did this kid 
know he wanted to sit in the 
shadows? Frowning, he sat down 
he and the dead man. 

He listened to the lonely 
rhythms of the four-piece Mar- 
tian orchestra. 

The Martians were fragile, 
doll-like creatures with heads too 
large for their spindly bodies. 
Their long fingers played upon 
the strings of their cirillas or 
crawled over the holes of their 
flutes like spider legs. Their tune 
was sad. Even when they played 
an Earth tune, it still seemed a 
song of old Mars, charged with 
echoes of lost voices and forgot- 
ten grandeur. 

For an instant, Ben’s mind rose 
above the haunting vision of the 
dead man. He thought. What are 
they doing here, these Martians? 
Here, in a smoke-filled room 
under a metalite dome on a dust- 
covered world? Couldn’t they 
have played their music on Mats? 
Or had they^like me, felt the chal- 
lenge of new worlds? 

He sobered. It didn’t matter. 
He ordered a whiskey from a 
Chinese waiter. He wet his lips 
but did not drink. His gaze wan- 
dered over the faces of the Inn’s 
other occupants. 

you’ve got to find him, he 
thought, you’ve got to find the 
man with the red beard. It’s the 
only way you can escape the dead 
man. 



T he dead man was real. His 
name was Cobb. He was stout 
and flabby and about forty and 
he hated spacemen. 

His body was buried now — 
probably in the silent gray wastes 
outside Luna City. But he’d be- 
come a kind of invisible Siamese 
twin, as much a part of Ben as 
sight in his eyes. 

Sometimes the image would be 
shuffling dnmkenly beside him, 
its lips spitting whiskey-slurred 
curses. 

Again, its face would be a 
pop-eyed mask of surprise as 
Ben’s fist thudded into its jaw. 
More often, the face would be 
frozen in the whiteness of death. 
The large eyes would stare. Blood 
would trickle from a corner of 
the gaping mouth. 

You can forget a living man. 
You can defeat him or submit to 
him or ignore him, and the matter 
is over and done. You can’t es- 
cape from a memory that has 
burned into your mind. 

It had begun a week ago in 
Luna City. The flight from White 
Sands had been successful. Ben, 
quietly and moderately, wanted 
to celebrate. He stopped alone in 
a rocketfront bar for a beer. The 
man named Cobb plopped his 
portly and unsteady posterior on 
the stool next to him. 

“Spacemen,” he muttered, “are 
getting like flies. Ever5rwhere, all 
you see’s spacemen.” 



A COFFIN FOR JACOB 



59 



He was a neatly dressed ci- 
vilian. 

Ben smiled. “If it weren’t for 
spacemen, you wouldn’t be here.” 

“The name’s Cobb.” The man 
hiccoughed. “Spacemen in their 
white monkey suits. They think 
they’re little tin gods. Betcha you 
think you’re a little tin god.” He 
downed a shot of whiskey. 

Ben stiffened. He was twenty- 
four and dressed in the white, 
crimson-braided uniform of the 
Odyssey’s junior astrogation offi- 
cer. He was three months out of 
the Academy at White Sands and 
the shining uniform was like a 
key to all the mysteries of the 
Universe. 

He’d sought long for that key. 

AT THE age of five — perhaps 
in order to dull the memory 
of his parents’ death in a recent 
strato-jet crash — he’d spent 
hours watching the night sky for 
streaking flame-tails of Moon 
rockets. At ten, he’d ground his 
first telescope. At fourteen, he’d 
converted an abandoned shed on 
the government boarding-school 
grounds to a retreat which housed 
his collection of astronomy and 
rocketry books. 

At sixteen, he’d spent every 
weekend holiday hitchhiking 
from Boys Town No. 5 in the 
Catskills to Long Island Space- 
port. There, among the grizzled 
veterans of the old Moon Patrol, 



he’d found friend^ who under- 
stood his dream and who later 
recommended his appointment to 
the U. S. Academy for the Con- 
quest of Space. 

And a month ago, he’d signed 
aboard the Odyssey — the first 
ship, it was rumored, equipped to 
venture as far as the asteroids 
and perhaps beyond. 

Cobb was persistent: “Damn 
fools shoulda known enough to 
stay on Earth. What the hell good 
is it, jumpin’ from planet to 
planet?” 

The guy’s drunk, Ben thought. 
He took his drink and moved 
three stools down the bar. 

Cobb followed. “You don’t like 
the truth, eh, kid? You don’t 
like people to call you a sucker.” 

Ben rose and started to leave 
the bar, but Cobb grabbed his 
arm and held him there. 

“Thas what you are — a sucker. 
You’re young now. Wait ten 
years. You’ll be dyin’ of radiation 
rot or a meteor’ll get you. Wait 
and see, sucker!” 

Until this instant, Ben had sup- 
pressed his anger. Now, suddenly 
and without warning, it welled up 
into savage fury. 

His fist struck the man on the 
chin. Cobb’s eyes gaped in 
shocked horror. He spun back- 
ward. His head cracked sicken- 
ingly on the edge of the bar. The 
sound was like a punctuation 
mark signaling the end of life. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He sank to the floor, eyes 
glassy, blood tricking down his 
jaw. 

Ben knew that he was dead. 
Then, for a single absurd sec- 
ond, Ben was seized with terror 

just as, a moment before, he’d 

been overwhelmed with anger. 

He ran. 

F or some twenty minutes, he 
raced through a dizzying, 
nightmare world of dark rocket- 
front alleys and shouting voices 
and pursuing feet. 

At last, abruptly, he realized 
that he was alone and in silence. 
He saw that he was still on the 
rocketfront, but in the Tycho- 
ward side of the city. 

He huddled in a dark corner 
of a loading platform and lit a 
cigarette. A thousand stars — a 
thousand motionless balls of sil- 
ver fire — shone above him 
through Luna Cit^s transparent 
dome. 

He was sorry he’d hit Cobb, of 
course. He was not sorry he’d run. 
Escaping at least gave him a 
power of choice, of decision. 

You can do two things, he 
thought. 

You can give yourself up, and 
that’s what a good officer would 
do. That would eliminate the es- 
cape charge. Yot^d get off with 
voluntary manslaughter. Under 
interplanetary law, that would 
mean ten years in prison and a 

A COFFIN FOR JACOB 



dishonorable discharge. And then 
yot/d be free. 

But yot/d be through with 
rockets and space. They don’t 
want new men aver thirty-four 
for officers on rockets or even for 
third-class jet-men on beat-up 
freighters — they don’t want con- 
victed killers. You'd get the rest 
of the thrill of conquering space 
through video and by peeking 
through electric fences of space- 
ports. 

Or — 

There were old wives’ tales of 
a group of renegade spacemen 
who operated from the Solar Sys- 
tem’s frontiers. The spacemen 
weren’t outlaws. They were mis- 
fits, rejectees from the clearing 
houses on Earth. 

And whereas no legally recog- 
nized ship had ventured past 
Mars, the souped-up renegade 
rigs had supposedly hit the as- 
teroids. Their headquarters was 
Venus. Their leader — a subject 
of popular and fantastic conjec- 
ture in the men’s audiozines — 
wash rumored to be a red- 
bearded giant. 

So, Ben reflected, you can take 
a beer-and-pretzels tale seriously. 
You can hide for a couple of 
days, get rid of your uniform, 
change your name. You can wait 
for a chance to get to Venus. To 
hell with your duty. You can try 
to stay in space, even if you exile 
yourself from Earth.

After all, was it right for a sin- 
gle second, a single insignificant 
second, to destroy a man’s life 
and his dream? 

TTE WAS lucky. He found a 
tramp freighter whose skip- 
per was on his last flight before 
retirement. Discipline was lax, in- 
vestigation of new personnel even 
more so. 

Ben Curtis made it to Venus. 

There was just one flaw in his 
decision. He hadn’t realized that 
the memory of the dead man’s 
face would haunt him, torment 
him, follow him as constantly as 
breath flowed into his lungs. 

But might not the rumble of 
atomic engines drown the mur- 
muring dead voice? Might not 
the vision of alien worlds and in- 
finite spaceways obscure the dead 
face? 

So now he sat searching for a 
perhaps nonexistent red-bearded 
giant, and hoping and doubting 
and fearing, all at once. 

"You look for someone, senor?” 

He jumped. “Oh. You still 
here?” 

“Oui" The Martian kid 
grinned, his mouth full of purple 
teeth. "I keep you company on 
your first night in Hoover City, 
n’est-ce-pas?” 

“This isn’t my first night here,” 
Ben lied. “I’ve been around a 
while.” 

“You are spacemen?” 



Ben threw a fifty-cent credit 
piece on the table. “Here. Take 
off, will you?” 

Spiderlike fingers swept down 
upon the coin. “Ich danke, senor. 
You know why city is called 
Hoover City?” 

Ben didn’t answer. 

“They say it is because after 
women come, they want first 
thing a thousand vacuum clean- 
ers for dust. What is vacuum 
cleaner, monsieur?” 

Ben raised his hand as if to 
strike the boy. 

“Ai-yee, I go. You keep listen 
to good Martian music.” 

The toothpick of a body 
melted into the semi-darkness. 

Minutes passed. There were 
two more whiskeys. A ceaseless 
parade of faces broke through the 
smoky veil that enclosed him — 
reddish balloon faces, scaly rep- 
tilian faces, white-skinned, slit- 
eyed faces, and occasionally a 
white, rouged, powdered face. But 
nowhere was there a face with a 
red beard. 

A sense of hopelessness gripped 
Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but 
one of a dozen cities of Venus. 
Each had twenty dives such as 
this. 

He needed help. 

But his picture must have been 
’scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A 
reward must have been offered 
for his capture. Whom could he 
trust? The Martian kid, perhaps?

Far down the darkened aisle 
nearest him, his eyes caught a 
flash of white. He tensed. 

Like the uniform of a Security 
Policeman, he thought. 

His gaze shifted to another aisle 
and another hint of whiteness. 

And then he saw another and 
another and another. 

Each whiteness became 
brighter and closer, like shrinking 
spokes of a wheel with Ben as 
their focal point. 

You idiot! The damned Mar- 
tian kid! You should have knovm! 

L ight showered the room 

in a dazzling explosion. Ben, 
half blinded, realized that a broad 
circle of unshaded globes in the 
ceiling had been turned on. 

The light washed away the 
room’s strangeness and its air of 
brooding wickedness, revealing 
drab concrete walls and a debris- 
strewn floor. 

Eyes blinked and squinted. There 
were swift, frightened movements 
and a chorus of angry murmurs. 
The patrons of the Blast Inn were 
like tatter-clad occupants of a 
house whose walls have been 
ripped away. 

Ben Curtis twisted his lean 
body erect. His chair tumbled 
backward, falling. 

The white-clad men charged, 
neuro-clubs upraised. 

A woman screamed. The music 
ceased. The Martian orchestra 



slunk with feline stealth to a rear 
exit. Only the giant Venusians 
remained undisturbed. They 
stood unmoving, their staring 
eyes shifting lazily in Ben’s di- 
rection. 

“Curtis!” one of the policemen 
yelled. “You’re covered! Hold it!” 

Ben whirled away from the ad- 
vancing police, made for the exit 
into which the musicians had dis- 
appeared. 

A hissing sound traveled past 
his left ear, a sound like com- 
pressed air escaping from a con- 
tainer. A dime-sized section of 
the concrete wall ahead of him 
crumbled. 

He stumbled forward. They 
were using deadly neuro-pistols 
now, not the mildly stunning 
neuro-clubs. 

Another hiss passed his cheek. 
He was about twelve feet from 
the exit. Another second, his brain 
screamed. Just another second 

Or would the exits be guarded? 

He heard the hiss. 

It hit directly in the small of 
his back. There was no pain, just 
a slight pricking sensation, like 
the shallow jab of a needle. 

H e froze as if yanked to a 
stop by a noose. His body 
seemed to be growing, swelling 
into balloon proportions. He 
knew that the tiny needle had 
imbedded itself deep in his flesh, 
knew that the paralyzing morto- 



A COFFIN FOR JACOB

Cain was spreading like icy fire 
into every fiber and muscle of his 
body. 

He staggered like a man of 
stone moving in slow motion. 
He’d have fifteen — maybe 
twenty — seconds before com- 
plete lethargy of mind and body 
overpowered him. 

In the dark world beyond his 
fading consciousness, he heard a 
voice yell, “Turn on the damn 
lights!” 

Then a pressure and a coldness 
were on his left hand. He realized 
that someone had seized it. 

A soft feminine voice spoke to 
him. “You’re wounded? They hit 
you?” 

“Yes.” His thick lips wouldn’t 
let go of the word. 

“You want to escape — even 
now?” 

“Yes.” 

“You may die if you don’t give 
yourself up.” 

“No, no.” 

He tried to stumble toward the 
exit. 

“All right then. Not that way. 
Here, this way.” 

Heavy footsteps thudded 
toward them. A few yards away, 
a flashlight flicked on. 

Hands were guiding him. He 
was aware of being pushed and 
pulled. A door closed behind him. 
The glare of the flashlight faded 
from his vision — if he still had 
vision. 



“You’re sure?” the voice per- 
sisted. 

“I’m sure,” Ben managed to 
say. 

“I have no antidote. You may 
die.” 

His mind fought to compre- 
hend. With the anti-paralysis in- 
jection, njassage and rest, a man 
could recover from the effects of 
mortocain within half a day. 
Without treatment, the paralysis 
could spread to heart and lungs. 
It could become a paralysis of 
death. An effective weapon: the 
slightest wound compelled the 
average criminal to surrender at 
once. 

“Anti . anti . .” The words 
were as heavy as blobs of mer- 
cury forced from his throat. “No 
. I’m sure . sure.” 

He didn’t hear the answer or 
anything else. 



■DEN CURTIS had no precise 
sensation of awakening. Re- 
turn to consciousness was an in- 
tangible evolution from a world 
of black nothingness to a dream- 
like state of awareness. 

He felt the pressure of hands 
on his naked arms and shoulders, 
hands that massaged, manipu- 
lated, fought to restore circulation 
and sensitivity. He knew they 
were strong hands. Their strength 
seemed to transfer itself to his 
own body. 

For a long time, he tried to 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



open his eyes. His lids felt welded 
shut But after a while, they 
opened. His world of darkness 
gave way to a translucent cloak 
of mist A round, featureless 
shape hovered constantly above 
— a face, he supposed. 

He tried to talk. Although his 
lips moved slightly, the only 
sound was a deep, staccato grunt- 
ing. 

But he heard someone say, 
“Don’t try to talk.” It was the 
same gentle voice he’d heard in 
the Blast Inn. “Don’t talk. Just 
lie still and rest. Everything’ll be 
all right” 

Everything all right, he 
thought dimly. 

There were long periods of 
lethargy when he was aware of 
nothing. There were periods of 
light and of darkness. Gradually 
he grew aware of things. He real- 
ized that the soft rubber mouth of 
a spaceman’s oxygen mask was 
clamped over his nose. He felt the 
heat of electric blankets swathed 
about his body. Occasionally a 
tube would be in his mouth and 
he would taste liquid food and 
feel a pleasant warmth in his 
stomach. 

Always, it seemed, the face was 
above him, floating in the obscur- 
ing mist. Always, it seemed, the 
soft voice was echoing in his ears: 
“Swallow this now. That’s it. 
You must have food.” Or, “Close 
your eyes. Don’t strain. It won’t 



be long. You’re getting better.” 

Better, he’d think. Getting bet- 
ter. 

At last, after one of the periods 
of lethargy, his eyes opened. The 
mist brightened, then dissolved. 

He beheld the cracked, un- 
painted ceiling of a small room, 
its colorless walls broken with a 
single, roimd window. He saw the 
footboard of his aluminite bed 
and the outlines of his feet be- 
neath a faded blanket. 

Finally he saw the face and fig- 
ure that stood at his side. 

“You are better?” the kind 
voice asked. 

T he face was that of a girl 

probably somewhere between 
twenty-five and thirty. Her fea- 
tures, devoid of makeup, had an 
unhealthy-looking pallor, as if she 
hadn’t used a sunlamp for many 
weeks. Yet, at the same time, her 
firm slim body suggested a solid- 
ity and a strength. Her straight 
brown hair was combed back- 
ward, tight upon her scalp, and 
drawn together in a knot at the 
nape of her neck. 

“I — I am better,” he mur- 
mured. His words were still slow 
and thick. “I am going to live?” 
“You will live.” 

He thought for a moment. 
“How long have I been here?” 
“Nine days.” 

“You took care of me?” He 
noted the deep, dark circles be-

neath her sleep-robbed eyes. 

She nodded. 

“You’re the one who carried 
me when I was shot?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why?” 

Suddenly he begah to cough. 
Breath came hard. She held the 
oxygen mask in readiness. He 
shook his head, not wanting it 

“Why?” he asked again. 

“It would be a long story. Per- 
haps I’ll tell you tomorrow.” 

A new thought cloaked in sud- 
den fear, entered his murky con- 
sciousness. “Tell me, will — will 
I be well again? Will I be able 
to walk?” 

He lay back then, panting, ex- 
hausted. 

“You have nothing to worry 
about” the girl said softly. Her 
cool hand touched his hot fore- 
head. “Rest. We’ll talk later.” 

His eyes closed and breath 
came easier. He slept. 

When he next awoke, his gaze 
turned first to the window. There 
was light outside, but he had no 
way of knowing if this was morn- 
ing, noon or afternoon — or on 
what planet. 

He saw no white-domed build- 
ings of Hoover City, no formal 
lines of green-treed parks, no 
streams of buzzing gsnro-cars. 
There was only a translucent and 
infinite whiteness. It was as if the 
window were set on the edge of 
the Universe overlooking a sol- 



emn, silent and matterless void. 
The girl entered the room. 
“Hi,” she said, smiling. The 
dark half-moons under her eyes 
were less prominent Her face was 
relaxed. 

She increased the pressure in 
his rubberex pillows and helped 
him rise to a sitting position. 
“Where are we?” he asked. 
“Venus.” 

“We’re not in Hoover City?” 
“No.” 

He looked at her, wondering. 
“You won’t tell me?” 

“Not yet. Later, perhaps.” 
“Then how did you get me 
here? How did we escape from 
the Inn?” 

CHE SHRUGGED. ‘We have 
^ friends who can be bribed. A 
hiding place in the city, the use 
of a small desert-taxi, a pass to 
leave the city — these can be had 
for a price.” 

“You’ll tell me your name?” 
“Maggie.” 

‘Why did you save me?” 

Her eyes twinkled mischiev- 
ously. “Because you’re a good as- 
trogator.” 

His own eyes widened. “How 
did you know that?” 

She sat on a plain chair beside 
his bed. “I know everything about 
you. Lieutenant Curtis.” 

“How did you learn my name? 
I destroyed all my papers — ” 

“I know that you’re twenty-

four. Bom July 10, 1971. Or- 
nbaned at four, you attended 
Boys Town in the Catskills till 
you were 19. You graduated from 
Academy at White Sands last 
June with a major in Astrogation. 
Your rating for the five-year pe- 
riod was 3.8 — the second highest 
in a class of fifty-seven. Your only 
low mark in the five years was a 
3.2 in History of Martian Civili- 
zation. Want me to go on?” 
Fascinated, Ben nodded. 

“You were accepted as junior 
astrogation officer aboard the 
Odyssey. You did well on your 
flight from Roswell to Luna City. 
In a barroom fight in Luna City, 
you struck and killed a man 
named Arthur Cobb, a pre-fab 
salesman. You’ve been charged 
with second degree murder and 
escape. A reward of 5,000 credits 
has been offered for your capture. 
You came to Hoover City in the 
hope of finding a renegade group 
of spacemen who operate beyond 
Mars. You were looking for them 
in the Blast Inn.” 

He gaped incredulously, strug- 
gling to rise from his pillows. “I 
— don’t get it.” 

“There are ways of finding out 
what we want to know. As I told 
you, we have many friends.” 

He fell back into his pillows, 
breathing hard. She rose quickly. 

“I’m sorry,” she said. “I 
shouldn’t have told you yet. I felt 
so happy because you’re alive.

Rest now. We’ll talk again soon. 

“Maggie, you — you said I’d 
live. You didn’t say I’d be able to 
walk again.” 

She lowered her gaze. “I hope 
you’ll be able to.” 

“But you don’t think I will, do 

you?” 

“I don’t know. We’ll try walk- 
ing tomorrow. Don’t think about 
it now. Rest.” 

He tried to relax, but his mind 
was a vortex of conjecture. 

“Just one more question,” he 
almost whispered. 

“Yes?” 

‘The man I killed — did he 
have a wife?” 

She hesitated. He thought. 
Damn it, of all the questions, why 
did I ask that? 

Finally she said, “He had a 
wife.” 

“Children?” 

“Two. I don’t know their ages.” 

She left the room. 

ff ; SANK into the softness of 
his bed. As he turned over on 
his side, his gaze fell upon an 
object on a bureau in a far corner 
of the room. 

He sat straight up, his chest 
heaving. 

The object was a tri-dimen- 
sional photo of a rock-faced man 
in a merchant spaceman’s um- 
form. He was a giant of a man 
with a neatly trimmed red beard! 
Ben stared at the photo for a

long time. At length, he slipped 
into restless sleep. Images of faces 
and echoes of words spun through 
his brain. 

The dead man returned to him. 
Bloodied lips cursed at him. 
Glassy eyes accused him. Some- 
where were two lost children cry- 
ing in the night. 

And towering above him was a 
red-bearded man whose great 
hands reached down and beck- 
oned to him. Ben crawled through 
the night on hands and knees, his 
legs numb and useless. The crjHing 
of the children was a chilling wail 
in his ears. 

His head rose and turned to the 
red-bearded man. His pleading 
voice screamed out to him in a 
thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as 
he screamed, the giant disap- 
peared, to be replaced by white- 
booted feet stomping relentlessly 
toward him. 

He awoke still screaming . 

A night without darkness 
passed. Ben lay waiting for Mag- 
gie’s return, a question already 
formed in his mind. 

She came and at once he asked, 
“Who is the man with the red 
beard?” 

She smiled. “I was right then 
when I gave you that thumbnail 
biog. You were looking for him, 
weren’t you?” 

“Who is he?” 

She sat on the chair beside him. 

“My husband,” she said softly. 

68 



He began to understand. “And 
your husband needs an astroga- 
tor? That’s why you saved me?” 
“We need all the good men we 
can get” 

‘Where is he?” 

She cocked her head in mock 
suspicion. “Somewhere between 
Mercury and Pluto. He’s building 
a new base for us — and a home 
for me. When his ship returns. I’ll 
be going to him.” 

Why aren’t you with him 
now?” 

“He said unexplored space is 
no place for a woman. So I’ve 
been studying criminal reports 
and photos from the Interplanet- 
ary Bureau of Investigation and 
trying to find recruits like your- 
self. You know how we operate?” 
He told her the tales he’d 
heard. 

CHE NODDED. “There are 
^ quite a few of us now — 
about a thousand — and a dozen 
ships. Our base used to be here on 
Venus, down toward the Pole. 
The dome we’re in now was de- 
signed and built by us a few years 
ago after we got pushed off 
Mars. We lost a few men in the 
construction, but with almost 
every advance in space, someone 
dies. 

“Venus is getting too civilized. 
We’re moving out and this dome 
is only a temporary base when we 
have cases like yours. The new

jjgge — I might as well tell you 
going to be an asteroid. I won’t 
gay which one. 

“Don’t get the idea that we’re 
outlaws. Sure, about half our 
group is wanted by the Bureau, 
but we make honest livings. We’re 
just people like yourself and 
Jacob.” 

“Jacob? Your husband?” 

She laughed. “Makes you think 
of a Biblical character, doesn’t it? 
Jacob’s ansdhing but that. And 
just plain ‘Jake’ reminds one of a 
grizzled old uranium prospector 
and he isn’t like that, either.” 

She lit a cigarette. “Anyway, the 
wanted ones stay out beyond the 
frontiers. Jacob and those like 
him can never return to Earth — 
not even to Hoover City — ex- 
cept dead. The others are physi- 
cal or psycho rejects who couldn’t 
get clearance if they went back 
to Earth. They know nothing but 
rocketing and won’t give up. They 
bring in our ships to frontier ports 
like Hoover City to unload cargo 
and take on supplies.” 

“Don’t the authorities object?” 
“Not very strongly. The I. B. I. 
has too many problems right here 
to search the whole System for a 
few two-bit crooks. Besides, we 
carry cargoes of almost pure 
uranium and tungsten and all the 
stuff that’s scarce on Earth and 
Mars and Venus. Nobody really 
cares whether it comes from the 
asteroids or Hades. If we want to 

A COFFIN FOR JACOB 



risk our lives mining it, that’s our 
business.” 

She pursed her lips. “But if 
they guessed how strong we are 
or that we have friends planted 
in the I. B. I. — well, things 
might be different. There prob- 
ably would be a crackdown.” 

Ben scowled. ‘What happens 
if there is a crackdown? And 
what will you do when Space 
Corps ships officially reach the 
asteroids? They can’t ignore you 
then.” 

“Then we move on. We dream 
up new gimmicks for our crates 
and take them to Jupiter, Saturn, 
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. In time, 
maybe, we’ll be pushed out of the 
System itself. Maybe it won’t be 
the white-suited boys who’ll make 
that first hop to the stars. It could 
be us, you know — if we live long 
enough. But that Asteroid Belt is 
murder. You can’t follow the text- 
book rules of astrogation out 
there. You make up your own.” 

B en stiffened. “And that’s 

why you want me for an as- 
trogator.” 

Maggie rose, her eyes wistful. 
“If you want to come — and if you 
get well.” She looked at him 
strangely. 

“Suppose — ” He fought to find 
the right words. “Suppose I got 
well and decided not to join 
Jacob. What would happen to 
me? Would you let me go?” 

69 



Her thin face was criss-crossed 
by emotion — alarm, then bewil- 
derment, then fear. “I don’t know. 
That would be up to Jacob.” 

He lay biting his lip, staring at 
the photo of Jacob. She touched 
his hand and it seemed that sad- 
ness now dominated the flurry of 
emotion that had coursed through 
her. 

“The only thing that matters, 
really,” she murmured, “is your 
walking again. We’ll try this aft- 
ernoon. Okay?” 

“Okay,” he said. 

When she left, his eyes were 
still turned toward Jacob’s photo. 

He was like two people, he 
thought. 

Half of him was an officer of 
the Space Corps. Perhaps one sin- 
gle starry-eyed boy out of ten 
thousand was lucky enough to 
reach that goal. 

He remembered a little picture 
book his mother had given him 
when she was alive. Under the 
bright pictures of spacemen were 
the captions: 

“A Space Officer Is Honest.” 
“A Space Officer Is Loyal.” “A 
Space Officer Is Dutiful.” 

Honesty, loyalty, duty. Trite 
words, but without those con- 
cepts, mankind would never have 
broken away from the planet that 
held it prisoner for half a million 
years. 

Without them, Everson, after 
three failures and a hundred men 



dead, would never have landed on] 
the Moon twenty-seven years ago.,! 

OEN SIGHED. He had a debt 
to pay. A good officer would] 
pay that debt. He’d surrender and] 
take his punishment He’d rip the ■ 
crimson braid from his uniform. 
He’d prevent the Academy for 
the Conquest of Space from being 
labeled the school of a murderer 
and a coward. 

And by doing these things, the' 
haunting image of a dead man 
would disappear from his visioa 

But the other half of Ben Cur- 
tis was the boy who’d stood trem-^ 
bling beneath a night sky of beck- 
oning stars. 

The eyes in Jacob’s photo 
seemed to be staring at the boy 
in him, not at the officer. They ap- 
peared both pleading and hopeful 
They were like echoes of cold, 
barren worlds and limitless space, 
of lurking and savage death. They 
held the terror of loneliness and 
of exile, of constant flight and hid- 
ing. 

But, too, they represented a 
strength that could fulfill a boy’s 
dream, that could carry a man to 
new frontiers. They, rather than 
the neat white uniform, now of- 
fered the key to shining miracles. 
That key was what Ben wanted. 

But he asked himself, as he had 
a thousand times, “If I follow 
Jacob, can I leave the dead man 
behind?” 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He tried to stretch his legs and 
he cursed their numbness. He 
smiled grimly. For a moment, he’d 
forgotten. How futile now to 
think of stars! 

What if he were to be like this 
always? Jacob would not want a 
man with dead legs. Jacob would 
either send him back to Earth 
or — ^Ben shuddered — see that he 
was otherwise disposed of. And 
disposal would be the easier 
course. 

T his was the crisis. He sat 
on the side of the bed, Mag- 
gie before him, her strong arm 
about his waist. 

“Afraid?” she asked. 

“Afraid,” he repeated, shaking. 
It was as if all time had been 
funneled into this instant, as if 
this moment lay at the very vor- 
tex of all a man’s living and desir- 
ing. There was no room in Ben’s 
mind for thoughts of Jacob now. 

“You can walk,” Maggie said 
confidently. “I know you can.” 

He moved his toes, ankles, legs. 
He began to rise, slowly, faltering- 
ly. The firm pressure around his 
waist increased. 

He stood erect. His legs felt 
like tree stumps, but here and 
there were a tingling and a 
warmth, a sensitivity. 

“Can you make it to the win- 
dow?” Maggie asked. 

“No, no, not that far.” 

“Try! Please try!” 



She guided him forward. 

His feet shuffled. Stomp, stomp. 
The pressure left his waist. Mag- 
gie stepped away, walked to the 
window, turned back toward him. 

He halted, swaying. “Not 
alone,” he mouthed fearfully. “I 
can’t get there by myself.” 

“Of course you can!” Maggie’s 
voice contained unexpected impa- 
tience. 

Ashamed, he forced his feet to 
move. At times, he thought he was 
going to crash to the floor. He 
lumbered on, hesitating, fighting 
to retain his balance. Maggie 
waited tensely, as if ready to leap 
to his side. 

Then his eyes turned straight 
ahead to the window. This was 
the first time he’d actually seen 
the arid, dust-cloaked plains of 
the second planet. He straight- 
ened, face aglow, as though a 
small-boy enthusiasm had been 
reborn in him. 

His tree-stump legs carried him 
to the window. He raised shaking 
hands against the thick glassite 
pane. 

Outside, the swirling white dust 
was omnipresent and unchalleng- 
ed. It cut smooth the surfaces of 
dust-veiled rocks. It clung to the 
squat desert shrubbery, to the tall 
skeletal shapes of Venusian nee- 
dle-plants and to the swish-tailed 
lizards that skittered beneath 
them. 

The shrill of wind, audible 



A COFFIN FOR JACOB 



71 



through the glassite, was like the 
anguished complaint of the planet 
itself, like the wail of an entity 
imprisoned in a dark tomb of 
dust Venus was a planet of fury, 
eternally howling its wrath at be- 
ings isolated from sunlight and 
greenery, from the clean black- 
ness of space and the warm glow 
of sister-planet and star. 

The dust covered all, absorbed 
all, eradicated all. The dust was 
master. The dome, Ben felt, was 
as transitory as a tear-drop of 
fragile glass falling down, down, 
to crash upon stone. 

“Is it always like this?” he 
asked. “Doesn’t the wind ever 
stop?” 

“Sometimes the wind dies. 
Sometimes, at night, you can see 
the lights from the city.” 

T¥E KEPT staring. The dome, 
-■"■■he thought, was a symbol of 
Man’s littleness in a hostile uni- 
verse. 

But, too, it was a symbol of 
his courage and defiance. And 
perhaps Man’s greatest strength 
lay in the very audacity that 
drove him to build such domes. 

“You like it, don’t you?” Mag- 
gie asked. “It’s lonely and ugly 
and wild, but you like it.” 

He nodded, breathless. 

She murmured, “Jacob used to 
say it isn’t the strange sights that 
thrill spacemen — it’s the thoughts 
that the sights inspire.” 

72 




He nodded again, still staring. 

She began to laugh. Softly at 
first, then more loudly. It was the 
kind of laughter that is close to 
crying. 

“You’ve been standing there 
for ten minutes! You’re going to 
walk again! You’re going to be 
well!” 

He turned to her, smiling with 
the joyous realization that he had 
actually stood that long without 
being aware of it. 

Then his smile died. 

Standing behind Maggie, in an 
open doorway, was a gray^ scaly, 
toadlike monster — a six-and-a- 
half-foot Venusian. He was mo- 
tionless as a statue, his green-lid- 
ded eyes staring curiously at Ben. 
His scaly hand was tight about 
the butt of an old-faShioned heat, 
pistol bolstered to his hip. 

Maggie suppressed a smile. | | 
“Don’t be frightened, Ben. This 
is Simon — Simple Simon, we call 
him. His I. Q. isn’t too high, but 
he makes a good helper and 
guard for me. He’s been so an- 
xious to see you, but I thought 
it’d be better if he waited until 
you were well.” 

Ben nodded, fascinated by the 
apparent muscular solidity of the 
creature. It hadn’t occurred to his 
numbed mind that he and Mag- 
gie were not the sole occupants 
of the dome. 

But Maggie had acted wisely, 
he thought. His nightmares had

COFFIN FOR JACOB 



been terrifying enough without 
bringing Simple Simon into them. 

“Shake hands with Ben,” she 
told the Venusian. 

Simple Simon lumbered for- 
ward, then paused. His eyes 
blinked. “No,” he grated. 

Maggie gasped. “Why, Simple 
Simon, whafs the matter?” 

The gray creature rasped, “Ben 
— he not one of us. He thinks — 
different In thoughts — thinks es- 
cape. Earth.” 

l^AGGIE PALED. “He is one 
of us, Simon.” She stepped 
forward and seized the Venusian’s 
arm. “You go to your room. Stand 
guard. You guard Ben just like 
you guard me. Understand?” 
Simple Simon grunted, “I 
guard. If Ben go — I stop him. I 
stop him good.” He raised his 
huge hands suggestively. 

“No, Simon! Remember what 
Jacob told you. We hurt no one. 
Ben is our friend. You help him!” 
The Venusian thought for a 
long moment Then he nodded. 
“I help Ben. But if go — stop.” 

She led the creature out of the 
room and closed the door. 

“Whew,” Ben sighed. “I’d heard 
those fellows were telepaths. Now 
I Know" 

Maggie’s trembling hands 
reached for a cigarette. “I — I 
guess I didn’t think, Ben. Venu- 
sians can’t really read your mind, 
but they see your feelings, your 



emotions. It’s a logical evolution- 
ary development, I suppose. Au- 
ditory and visual commxmication 
are difficult here, so evolution 
turned to empathy. And that’s 
why Jacob keeps a few Venusians 
in our group. They can detect any 
feeling of disloyalty before it be- 
comes serious.” 

Ben remembered Simple Sim- 
on’s icy gaze and the way his 
rough hand had gripped his heat 
pistol. “They could be dangerous.” 

“Not really. They’re as loyal as 
Earth dogs to their masters. I 
mean they wouldn’t be dangerous 
to anyone who’s loyal to us.” 

Silently, she helped him back 
to his bed. 

“I’m sorry, Maggie — sorry I 
haven’t decided yet.” 

She neither answered nor look- 
ed at him. 

Grimly, he realized that his 
status had changed. He was no 
longer a patient; he was a pris- 
oner. 

A Venusian day passed, and a 
Venusian night. The dust swirled 
and wind blew, as constant as the 
whirl of indecision in Ben’s mind. 

Maggie was patient. Once, 
when she caught him gazing at 
Jacob’s photo, she asked, “Not 
yet?” 

He looked away. “Not yet.” 

TTE LEARNED that the little 
■■■■^•dome consisted of three 
rooms, each shaped like pieces 



f 

^ of a fluffy pie with narrow con- 
Crete hallways between. 

His room served as a bedroom 
and he discovered that Maggie 
slept on a pneumatic cot in the 
kitchen. The third room, opening 
into the airlock, housed a small 
hydroponics garden, sunlamp, 
short-wave visi-radio, and such 
emergency equipment as oxygen 
tanks, windsuits, and vita-rations. 
It was here that Simple Simon re- 
mained most of the time, tending 
the garden or peering into the 
viewscreen that revealed the ter- 
rain outside the dome. 

Maggie prepared Ben’s meals, 
bringing them to him on a tray 
until he was able to sit at a table 
As his paralysis diminished, he 
helped her with cooking — with 
Simple Simon standing by as a 
mute, motionless observer. 

Occassionally Maggie would 
talk of her girlhood in a small 
town in Missouri and how she’d 
dreamed of journeying to the 
stars. 

“ ‘Stars are for boys,’ they’d tell 
me, but I was a queer one. While 
other gals were dressing for their 
junior proms, I’d be in sloppy 
slacks down at the spaceport with 
Jacob.” 

She laughed often — perhaps in 
a deliberate attempt to disguise 
the omnipresent tension. And her 
laughter was like laughter on 
Earth, floating through comfort- 
able houses and over green fields 
I 

A COFFIN FOR JACOB 



and through clear blue sky. When 
she laughed, she possessed a beau- 
ty- 

Despite her pale face and lack 
of makeup, Ben realized that she 
was no older than he. 

li I’d only known her back on 
Earth, he thought. It I — And 
then he told himself. You’ve got 
enough problems. Don’t create an- 
other one! 

Finally, except for a stiffness 
in his leg joints, he’d fully recov- 
ered. 

“How much time do I have?” 
he asked. 

“Before you decide?” 

“Yes.” 

“Very little. Jacob’s ship is on 
its way. It’ll be here — well, you 
can’t tell about these things. Two 
or three Earth days, maybe even 
tomorrow. It’ll stay in Hoover 
City long enough to discharge and 
load cargo. Then it’ll stop here 
for us and return to — to our new 
base.” 

“What do you think Jacob 
would do if I didn’t want to go 
with him?” 

S HE SHOOK her head. “You 
asked me that before. I said 
I didn’t know.” 

Ben thought, I know a lot 
about you, Jacob. I know yot/re 
based on an asteroid. I know how 
many men you have, how many 
ships. I know where this dome is. 
I know you have men planted in 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



75 



the I. B. I. Would you let me go, 
knowing these things? How great 
is your immunity from the law? 
Do you love freedom so much 
that yot/d kill to help preserve it? 

Fear crawled through his mind 
on icy legs. 

“Maggie,” he said, “what would 
Jacob do if he were me?” 

She looked amused. “Jacob 
wouldn’t have gotten into your 
situation. He wouldn’t have struck 
Cobb. Jacob is — ” 

“A man? And Fm still a boy? 
Is that what you mean?” 

“Not exactly. I think you’ll be 
a man after you make your deci- 
sion.” 

He frowned, not liking her an- 
swer. 

“You think the dream of 
going into space is a boss’s dream, 
that it can’t belong to a man, 
too?” 

“Oh, no. Jacob still has the 
dream. Most of our men do. And 
in a man, it’s even more wonder- 
ful than in a boy.” Then her face 
became more serious. “Ben, 
you’ve got to decide soon. And 
it’s got to be a complete decision. 
You can have no doubt in your 
mind.” 

He nodded. “On account of 
Simon, you mean,” 

She motioned for him to come 
to the window in his room. He 
gazed outward, following the line 
of her finger as she pointed. 

He saw a man-sized mound of 



stones, dimly visible beneath the 
wind-whipped dust 

A grave. 

“He was a man like you,” Mag- 
gie said softly. “God knows Sim- 
on didn’t try to kill him. But he 
was escaping. He — ^he made the 
decision not to join us. Simon 
sensed it There was a struggle. 
Simon’s hands — well, he doesn’t 
realize — ” 

She didn’t have to explain fur- 
ther. Ben knew what those 
mighty scaly paws could do. 

^^HE MOMENTS were now 
like bits of eternity cloaked in 
frozen fear. Somewhere in the 
blackness of interplanetary space, 
Jacob’s rocket was streaking 
closer and closer to Venus. How 
far away was it? A million miles? 
Fifty thousand? Or was it now — 
right now — ripping through the 
murky Venusian atmosphere 
above the dome? 

A complete decision, Maggie 
had said. 

Jacob didn’t want a potential 
deserter in his group. And you 
couldn’t pretend that you were 
loyal to Jacob — not with mon- 
strosities like Simple Simon 
about 

Soon Jacob, not Ben, might 
have to make a decision— a deci- 
sion that could result in a second 
cairn of stones on the wind-swept 
desert. 

Ben shivered. 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Before retiring, he wandered 
nervously into the supply room. 
Maggi® was poised over the visi- 
radio. Simple Simon was intently 
scanning the night-shrouded ter- 
rain in the viewscreen. 

“Any news?” Ben asked Mag- 
gie. 

The girl grunted negatively 
without looking up. 

Ben’s gaze fell upon the array 
of oxygen masks, windsuits, vita- 
rations. Then, on a littered shelf, 
he spied a small Venusian com- 
pass. 

Almost automatically, his hand 
closed over it. His brain stirred 
with a single thought; A compass 
could keep a man traveling in a 
straight line. 

Simple Simon restlessly shift- 
ed. He turned to Ben, blinking in 
the frighteningly alien equivalent 
of a suspicious scowl. 

Ben’s hand tightened about the 
compass. He tried to relax, to 
force all thought of it from his 
mind. He stared at the view- 
screen, concentrating on the 
ceaseless drift of dust. 

The Venusian’s eyes studied 
him curiously, as if searching 
his mind for the illusive echo of 
a feeling that had given him 
alarm. 

“I think I’ll turn in,” yawned 
Ben. “ ’Night, Maggie. 

Simon frowned, apparently 
frustrated in his mental search. 
“Ben — not one of us. I — watch.” 



W ITHOUT ANSWERING, 
Ben returned to his room, 
the compass hot and moist from 
the perspiration in his hand. 

He took a deep breath. 

Why had he taken the com- 
pass? He wasn’t sure. Perhaps, he 
reflected, his decision had already 
been made, deep beneath the sur- 
face of consciousness. 

He stood before the window, 
peering into the night. He knew 
that to attempt to sleep was futile. 
Sleep, for the past few days an 
ever-ready friend, had become a 
hostile stranger. 

God, his brain cried, what shall 
I do? 

Slowly, the dust outside the 
window settled. The scream of 
wind was no longer audible. His 
startled eyes beheld dim, faraway 
lights — those of Hoover City, he 
guessed. 

It was as if, for the space of a 
few seconds, some cosmic power 
had silenced the Venusian fury, 
had guided him toward making 
his decision. 

He whipped up his compass. 
He barely had time to complete 
the measurement. 

“Sixty-eight degrees,” he read. 
“Northeast by east.” 

Fresh wind descended onto the 
plain. Dancing dust erased the 
vision of the lights. 

“Sixty-eight, sixty-eight,” he 
kept muttering. 

But now there was nothing to 



A COFFIN FOR JACOB 



77 



do — except try to sleep and be 
ready. 

Strong hands shook him out of 
restless sleep. He opened bis eyes 
and saw complete darkness. He 
thought at first that his eyesight 
had failed. 

“Ben! Wake up!” Maggie’s 
voice came to him, crisp, com- 
manding. “The rocket’s coming. 
I’ve decoded the message. We 
only have a few minutes.” 

The girl snapped on a small 
bulkhead light. She left him alone 
to dress. 

He slid out of bed, a drowsiness 
still in him. He reached for his 
clothing. Abruptly, the full im- 
plication of what she had said 
struck him. 

Jacob’s rocket was coming. 
This was the time for decision, 
yet within his taut body there was 
only a jungle of conflicting im- 
pulses. 

AGGIE RETURNED, her 
face hard, her eyes asking 
the silent question. 

Ben stood frozen. The slow sec- 
onds beat against his brain like 
waves of ice. 

At last she said, “Ready, Ben?” 
She spoke evenly, but her search- 
ing gaze belied the all-important 
significance of her words. 

In the dim light, the photo- 
graph of Jacob was indistinguish- 
able, but Ben could still see the 
image of the dead man. 

78 



He thought, I can’t run away 
with Jacob like a selfish, coward- 
ly kid! No matter how bright the 
stars would bet that brightness 
couldn’t destroy the image of a 
dead man with staring eyes. No 
matter what Jacob and Simon do 
to me, I’ve got to try to get back 
to Earth. 

He suddenly felt clean inside. 
He was no longer ashamed to hold 
his head high. 

“Maggie,” he said. 

“Yes?” 

“I’ve made my decision.” 

Outside the window, a waterfall 
of flame cascaded onto the desert, 
pushing aside the dust and the 
darkness. The deep-throated 
sound of rocket engines grumbled 
above the whining wind. The floor 
of the dome vibrated. 

“The rocket’s here!” Maggie 
cried. 

The flaming exhaust from the 
ship dissolved into the night. The 
rocket thunder faded into the 
wind. 

The alarm on the dome’s inner 
airlock bulkhead rang. Maggie 
ran like a happy child through the 
concrete corridor, Ben following. 
She bounded into the supply 
room, pushed Simple Simon aside, 
stopped before a control panel. 
Her fingers flew over switches and 
levers. 

The airlock door slid open. A 
short, stubble-bearded man clad 
in windsuit and transparalite hel- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



met stomped in. He unscrewed 
the face plate of his helmet. His 
ears were too big and he looked 
like a fat doll. 

“We’re ready for you, Mrs. 
pierce,” he said. 

Maggie nodded eagerly. She 
whirled back to Ben. “Hurry! Get 
your helmet and suit on!” 

She spun back to the big-eared 
little man. “Cargo unloaded? All 
set for the flight home?” 

Home, Ben thought She calls 
a place she’s never seen home. 
“Cargo’s unloaded.” 

“No trouble with the I. B. I.? 
No investigation?” 

“Not yet. We’re good for a few 
more hauls, I guess.” 

B en slipped on his windsuit. 

He glariced at the control 
panel for the airlock. Yes, he 
could manipulate it easily. He 
contemplated the heat pistol at 
Simple Simon’s hip. A tempting 
idea — but, no, he wanted no more 
of violence. 

Then he bit his lip. He cleared 
his mind of all thought. 

Simple Simon evidently had 
not noted the impulse that flicked 
his adrenals into pumping. 

The big-eared man stared 
strangely at Maggie. “Mrs. Pierce, 
before we go, I’d better tell you 
something.” 

“Y ou can do that on the 
rocket.” 

Maggie stepped forward to 

A COFFIN FOR JACOB 




seize her helmet The man block- 
ed her movement 

“Mrs. Pierce, your husband — 
Jacob — was on the rocket.” 
‘What?” The girl released a 
broken, unbelievirig little laugh. 
‘Why, he wouldn’t dare! That 
idiot, taking a chance like — ” 
Alarm twisted her features. “He — 
he wasn’t captured — ” 

“No, he wasn’t captured. And 
he took no chance, Mrs. Pierce.” 
A moment of silence. Then she 
sucked in her breath. 

Ben understood. Words echoed 
in his mind: “Jacob and those 
like him can never return to 
Earth, not even to Hoover City — 
except dead.” 

Maggie swayed. Ben and the 
big-eared little man jumped to 
her side, guided her back into the 
compartment used as a kitchen. 
They helped her to a chair. Ben 
turned on the fire beneath a cof- 
fee pot. Simple Simon watched 
silently. 

Her eyes empty and staring, 
Maggie asked, “How did it hap- 
pen?” 

‘We were heading into a clump 
of baby asteroids the size of peas. 
The radar warning was too slow. 
We couldn’t pull away; we had to 
stop. The deceleration got him — 
crushed him. He lived for five 
minutes afterward.” 

The little man produced a fold- 
ed paper from a pocket of his 
suit. “Jacob said he had some 

79 



ideas he had to get down on 
paper. God knows why, but dur- 
ing those five minutes he drew 
up this plan for improving our 
deceleration compensator.” 

“Plans for — ” she gasped. 

“He was a spaceman, Mrs. 
Pierce.” The man handed her the 
paper. Ben caught a glimpse of 
scribbled circuits, relays, cathodes. 

“When he finished,” the man 
continued, “he said to tell you 
that he loved you.” 

She started to hand the paper 
back. 

The spaceman shook his head. 
“No, the original i;s yours. I’ve 
made copies for our own ships 
and for the brass in Hoover City.” 

1YT AGGIE KEPT talking to the 
little man, lost in the world 
he was creating for her. Ben was 
excluded from that world, a stran- 
ger. 

Then Ben saw his opportunity. 

Simple Simon’s face was ex- 
pressionless, but tears were zig- 
zagging down his gray, reptilian 
features. Ben stared for several 
seconds, wondering if his vision 
had deceived him. Till this in- 
stant, he’d somehow assumed that 
the big Venusian was devoid of 
emotion. 

But Simple Simon was crying. 

It was unlikely that the crea- 
ture would peer into his mind at 
a moment like this. 

Step by step, Ben backed to- 



ward the open door in the rear 
of the compartment. Silently, he 
slipped through it. He attempted 
to move automatically, without 
feeling. 

He darted into the supply 
room. The continued drone of 
voices told him his action had 
not been observed. 

He didn’t like it at all. Escap- 
ing this way was like crumpling 
Maggie’s grief into an acid ball 
and hurling it into her face. But 
he had no other choice. 

A few seconds later, he was 
dressed in windsuit and oxygen 
helmet. A can of vita-rations was 
strapped to his back and his com- 
pass was in his hand. 

Heart refusing to stop pound- 
ing, he threw the levers and 
switches to open the airlock. He 
cringed under the grinding, scrap- 
ing noise, as loud to him as the 
ringing clash of swords. 

But the murmur of voices con- 
tinued. 

He stepped outside. The air- 
lock door clanged shut. He was 
caught by the biting dust and the 
shrill banshee wind. He fell, then 
scrambled erect. 

To his right, he saw the silver 
sheen of Jacob’s rocket shining 
behind a row of golden, eyelike 
portholes. Beneath it were black 
outlines of moving, helmeted fig- 
ures. 

He bent low to study the lumi- 
nous dial of his compass. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Behind him was a grating and 
a sliding of metal. A movement 
in the darkness. 

He txirned. 

Dimly illuminated by the glow 
from the rocket ports was the 
grim, stony face of Simple Simon. 

T he VENUSIAN was like a 
piece of the night itself, com- 
pressed and solidified to form a 
living creature. The impression 
was contradicted only by the 
glowing whiteness of his eyes. 

The reptilian body shuffled for- 
ward. The scales on his great face 
and chest reflected the lights from 
the rocket like Christmas tree 
ornaments dusted with gold. 

His hands reached out. 

Words thundered in Ben’s me- 
mory: God knows Simon didn’t 
try to kill him. Simon’s hands — 
well, he doesn’t realize — 

Ben hopped away from the 
groping hands, slipped the com- 
pass into his pocket, balled his 
fists. The wind caught at his body. 
He stumbled, then recovered his 
balance. 

Despite the wind and his suit’s 
bulkiness, he was surprised at his 
own agility. He recalled that the 
gravitational pull of Venus was 
only four-fifths of Earth’s. That 
was an advantage. 

Crouching against the wind, he 
stepped to his left, away from 
the rocket. He was reluctant to 
enter an area of greater darkness, 

A COFFIN FOR JACOB 



but neither did he want to risk 
observation by the men he’d seen 
near Jacob’s ship. 

Simple Simon followed. He 
moved like an automaton, fimc- 
tioning with awkward, methodical 
slowness. His hands, speckled 
with reflected light, rose up out 
of the darkness. 

Ben stepped back, wiped the 
dust from his clouded face-plate. 
One swoop of those hands, he 
knew, could shatter his helmet, 
destroy his oxygen supply, leave 
him choking on deadly methane 
and carbon dioxide. 

But, so far, Simon seemed bent 
on capture, not destruction. That 
fact gave Ben a second advantage. 

Scaly fingers, moving now with 
greater swiftness, closed over the 
shoulder of his suit. Ben felt him- 
self being pulled forward, a child 
in the grasp of a giant. His brief 
surge of confidence vanished. Cold 
terror swept upon him. 

He lashed out wildly. His right 
fist found his target, found it so 
well that the skin split on his 
gloved knuckles. 

Simon’s head snapped back. 
The grasping fingers slipped from 
Ben’s suit. 

But still the Venusian lumber- 
ed ahead, an irresistible jugger- 
naut, the hands continually grop- 
ing. Ben ducked and slipped aside. 
The can of vita-rations was rip- 
ped from his back. 

He crouched low, fighting the 



80 



81 



wind, maneuvering for another 
blow. His lungs ached, but he had 
no opportunity to increase his hel- 
met’s oxygen flow. His weak leg 
muscles were beginning to pain as 
though with needles of fire. 

^T^HE HANDS crashed down 
upon his shoulders. This 
time, his fist found Simon’s stom- 
ach. The creature released a grunt 
audible above the howling of 
wind. His body doubled up. 

Ben struck again and again. 
His lungs throbbed as if they’d 
break through his chest. A fresh 
layer of dust coated his face- 
plate, nearly blinding him. He 
fought instinctively, gauntleted 
fists battering. 

Simple Simon fell. 

Ben brushed away the dust 
from his face-plate, turned up his 
helmet’s oxygen valve. Then he 
knelt by the fallen creature. 

A new fear came to Ben Curtis 
— a fear almost as great as that of 
being caught in Simon’s crushing 
grip. It was the fear that he had 
killed again. 

But even in the near-darkness, 
he could distinguish the labored 
rise and fall of the massive chest. 

Thank God, he thought. 

From the direction of Jacob’s 
ship, a flash of light caught his 
eye. The black shapes of helmeted 
men were becoming larger, nearer. 

Ben tensed. The spacemen 
couldn’t have heard sounds of 










the struggle, but they might have 
noticed movement. 

Puffing, Ben plunged into the 
darkness to his left, slowing only 
long enough to consult the dial 
of his compass. 

“Sixty-eight degrees,’’ he 
breathed. 

The compass dial was now his 
only companion and his only 
hope. It was the one bit of reality 
in a world of black, screaming 
nightmare. 

A t first Ben Curtis fought 
the wind and the dust and 
the night. His fists were clenched 
as they had been while struggling 
with Simon. Each step forward 
was a challenge, a struggle and — 



so far, at any rate — a victory. 

But how far was the city? Five 
miles? Ten? How could you 
judge distance through a haze of 
alien sand? 

And were Simple Simon or Ja- 
cob’s men following? How good 
was a Venusian’s vision at night? 
Would the scaly hands find him 
even now, descending on him 
from out of the blackness? 

He kept walking, walking. Six- 
ty-eight degrees. 

Gradually his senses grew 
numb to the fear of recapture. He 
became oblivious to the wailing 
wind and the beat of dust against 
his face-plate. He moved like a 
robot. His mind wandered back 
through time and space, a pin-

wheel spinning with unforgettable 
impressions, faces, voices. 

He saw the white features of a 
dead man, their vividness fading 
now and no longer terrifying. 

A Space Officer Is Honest A 
Space Officer Is Loyal. A Space 
Officer Is Dutiful. The words 
were like clear, satisfying music. 

He cursed at the image of a 
pop-eyed Martian boy. A tres fine 
table, monsieur. Close in the shad- 
ows. 

And yet, he told himself, the 
boy really didn’t do anything 
wrong. He was only helping to 
capture a murderer. Maybe he 
was lonesome for Mars and need- 
ed money to go home. 

Ben thought of Maggie: While 
other gals were dressing for their 
junior proms, I’d be in sloppy 
slacks down at the spaceport with 
Jacob ... If I’d only known her 
back on Earth — 

Maggie, sitting alone now with 
a wrinkled paper and its mass of 
scrawled circuits. Alone and hol- 
low with grief and needing help. 
Ben’s throat tightened. Damn it, 
he didn’t want to think about that 

What was it the little big-eared 
man had said? I’ve made copies 
for our own ships and for the 
brass in Hoover City. 

Why had he said that? Why 
would renegades give their se- 
crets to the Space Corps? The 
Corps would incorporate the dis- 
coveries in their ships. With them. 



they’d reach the asteroids. Jacob’s 
group would be pushed even fur- 
ther outward. 

Ben stopped, the wind whip- 
ping at his suit and buffeting his 
helmet — but not as hard as the 
answer he had found. 

J ACOB AND his men had an 
existence to justify, a debt to 
pay. They justified that existence 
and paid that debt by helping 
humanity in its starward advance. 

Maggie had said. We carry car- 
goes of almost pure uranium and 
tungsten and all the stuff that’s 
getting scarce on Earth and Mars 
and Venus. If we want to risk our 
lives getting it, that’s our business. 
... The dome we’re in now was 
designed and built by us a few 
years ago. We lost a few men in 
the construction, but with almost 
every advance in space, someone 
dies. 

The wind pressed Ben back. 
The coldness of the Venusian 
night was seeping into his suit. 
It was as if his body were bathed, 
at once, in flame and ice. 

He slipped, fell, his face turn- 
ed toward the sandy ground. He 
did not try to rise. 

Yet his mind seemed to soar 
above the pain, to carry him into 
a wondrous valley of new aware- 
ness. 

Man would never be content 
to stay on nine insignificant 
globes — not when his eyes had

to be signposts lining the great 
road and helping others to follow 
without fear. 

For all the brilliancy of their 
dreams, those men would be the 
lonely ones, the men of no return. 
For all the glory of their brief 
adventure, they would give not 
only their cloaks, but ultimately 
their lives. 

Ben lay trembling in the dark- 
ness. 

His brain cried. You couldn’t 
rig up a radar system or a decel- 
eration compensator, but you 
could chart those asteroids. You 
can’t bring a man named Cobb 
back to life, but you could help 
a thousand men and women to 
stay alive five or ten or twenty 
years from now. 

Ben knew at last what decision 
Jacob would have made. 

The reverse of sixty-eight on a 
compass is two-forty-eight. 

T IKE FLASHING knitting nee- 
dies, strong hands moved 
about his face-plate, his windsuit, 
his helmet. Then they were wip- 
ing perspiration from his white 
face and placing a wet cloth on 
the back of his neck. 

“You were coming back,” a 

A COFFIN ,FOR JACOB 




voice kept saying, “You were 
coming back.” 

His mouth was full of hot cof- 
fee. He became aware of a gen- 
tle face hovering above him, just 
as it had a seeming eternity ago. 

He sat up on the bed, conscious 
now of his surroundings. 

“Simon says you were coming 
back, Ben. Why?” 

He fought to grasp the mean- 
ing of Maggie’s words. “Simon? 
Simon found me? He brought me 
back?” 

“Only a short way. He said you 
were almost here.” 

Ben closed his eyes, reliving 
the whirlwind of thought that had 
whipped through his brain. He 
mumbled something about pio- 
neers and a scrawled paper and 
a debt and a decision. 

Then he blinked and saw that 
he and Maggie were not alone. 
Simple Simon stood at the foot 
of his bed — and was that a trace 
of a smile on his reptilian mouth? 
And three windsuited spacemen 
stood behind Maggie, helmets in 
their hands. One was a lean- 
boned, reddish-skinned Martian. 

Simple Simon said, “Ben — 
changed. Thinks — like us. Good 
now. Like — Jacob.” 

The little big-eared man step- 
ped up and shook hands with Ben. 
“If Simon says so, that’s good 
enough for me.” 

A blond-haired Earthman help- 
ed Ben from the bed. “Legs okay.

fellow? Think you’re ready?” 
Ben stood erect unassisted. 
“Legs okay. And I’m ready.” 

He thought for a moment. “But 
suppose I wasn’t ready. Suppose 
I didn’t want to go with you. I 
know a lot about your organiza- 
tion. What would you do?” 

The blond man shrugged un- 
troubledly. ‘We wouldn’t kill you, 
if that’s what you mean. We’d 
probably vote on whether to take 
you with us an3nvay or let you 
go.” His smile was frank. “I’m 
glad we don’t have to vote.” 

Ben nodded and turned to 
Maggie. “You’re still coming with 
us?” 

She shook her head, a mist 
shining in her sad eyes. “Not on 
this trip. Not without Jacob. I’ll 
get one of our desert taxis back 
to Hoover City. Then I’ll be going 
to Earth for a while. I’ve got some 
thinking to do and thinking is 
done best on Earth. Out here is 
the place for feeling.” Her eyes 
lost a little of their pain. “But I’ll 
be back. Jacob wouldn’t stay on 
Earth. Neither will I. I’ll be seeing 
you.” 

The big-eared man put his 
hand on Ben’s shoulder. 

“Think you can get us back 
to Juno?” he asked. 

Ben looked at Maggie and then 
at the big-eared man. “You’re as 
good as there,” he said confi- 
dently.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



one across 

By ARTHUR SELLINGS 



Illustrated by CAL 



Doing puzzles is an escape, 
eh? Then how was it Norman 
found himself so boxed in? 



Tt ' 



‘ELL, you took me 
for better or for 
worse,” Norman 
answered without turning from 
the paper-littered table. “And you 
knew about it before you took 
me. 



Ella smothered a sigh. Not 
even feminine logic could refute 
that one. What she hadn’t known 
beforehand was the fiendish in- 
genuity of crossword compilers. 



After all, she had reasoned, a 
square was a square and words 
were words. There was a limit to 
both, and a limit to the interest a 
grown man should find in them. 

A year of marriage had taught 
her otherwise. In good wifely 
fashion, she had tried to work up 
an intelligent interest in the 
things herself. But by the time 
she’d grasped what a cryptic clue 
was, that “bender you can take a

child on” in four letters could 
only be knee, Norman had moved 
on to skeletons. She struggled 
gamely after, but before she’d 
even got the knack of filling the 
blacks in, Norman had discovered 
the delights of coded puzzles. 

It was then that she gave up 
the unequal contest and looked 
on sadly while her husband 
threaded his way into deep and 
deeper mazes — square ones, 
round ones, pyramidal, hexa- 
gonal; literary, zoological, mathe- 
matical; straight, reversed, 
double-clued. 

p'LLA tried to tell herself she 
was lucky, that there were 
worse vices than an addiction to 
crosswords. But sometimes she 
couldn’t help feeling lonely and 
resentful. And then, as she just 
had, she protested. 

“It’s not as if you ever made 
anything out of them,” she com- 
plained, returning to the fray. 

“Now if one across connects 
with five down, then five down 
connects with eleven through.” 
In exactly the same abstracted 
tone, he said, “I won a gift certifi- 
cate last year, didn’t I?” 

“And what did you do with it? 
Bought books of puzzles!” 

He turned wearily in his chair. 
“Please, dear, don’t badger me. 
This is the toughest one I’ve ever 
tackled. The queerest, too.” 
“Really,” she said, yawning. 



“Well, it’s half-past one. I’m going 
to bed.” 

“Good night, dear,” Norman 
said. “Ah, that’s it — eleven 
through connects with three up.” 
His words tailed off into inco- 
herence as he scribbled. 

Ella shrugged hopelessly and 
went to bed. 

And so she missed seeing 

and perhaps it was a good thing 
she did — the fruits of her hus- 
band’s toil. 

After half an hour of frenzied 
activity, he laid his pencil aside, 
frowning perplexedly. He was 
sure he had found the key to it. 
He followed his tortuous lines of 
reasoning back, step by step, and 
they checked. There was no doubt 
about it, this was the only possi- 
ble solution. But it didn’t fit. 
There had to be four interlocking 
squares, yet how could there be? 
Unless — 

Of course! The puzzle was 
four-dimensional. It was one 
across, one down, one through 
and — well, he’d have to call it 
one out for the moment. But that 
was it! 

He jumped to his feet in tri- 
urriph. He could see it now. He — 
He suddenly experienced a feel- 
ing of vertigo, making him shut 
h’s eyes and bring his hand up to 
h;s head. Everything was a yel- 
lowish gray. 

He shouldn’t have leaped up 
like that, he told himself. It was 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



having a strange effect on him. 
Geometric patterns flowered and 
dwindled between his eyeballs 
and his closed lids. They were 
like nothing else he had ever 
seen before. Except, perhaps, 
those trick drawings of cubes that 
you can’t make up your mind 
whether you’re seeing from above 
or below. 

Suddenly the moving patterns 
froze and, the moment after, 
faded away. The dizziness left 
him. He opened his eyes thank- 
fully. 

And he sucked in his breath. 

For he was no longer in his 
own living room, but standing in 
a yellow landscape under a cop- 
per-colored sky. 

TTE SHUT his eyes again hur- 
riedly and thought hard. He 
must have been overdoing his 
solving puzzles lately, he rea- 
soned. That was it — he had 
conked out and been removed to 
the hospital. He was in the 
grounds now. Perhaps he had lost 
his memory for a spell; those 
things happened. 

But everything would be all 
right. Crosswords had taught him 
there was a name for practically 
everything, so there was sure to 
be one for this, some Greek or 
Latin name known to the serious- 
faced specialists who would be 
working on his case this very 
moment. Yes, everything was go- 

ONE ACROSS 



ing to be all right. Of course. 

With a desperate calm, he 
opened his eyes again. 

And>his heart sank. These were 
no hospital grounds. Unless the 
hospital was underneath him. And 
unless it was a special kind of 
place that hung an emerald sun 
up in the sky just to amuse the 
patients. 

Because, for as far as he could 
see, a rolling sea of saffron-colored 
grass stretched away. Between 
gaps in the waves, he could make 
out a green haze on the horizon 
that looked like hills. That was 
all. 

And this was real; he knew it 
in every fiber. He didn’t stop to 
reflect how real a thing would 
appear to somebody with delu- 
sions. He knew he wasn’t having 
any. And the sound he was sud- 
denly conscious of was no 
delusion, either. A metallic click- 
ing like — like some frightful 
beast sharpening long claws one 
against another. He felt his knees 
weaken. 

The sound came from his left, 
from beh’nd a hillock. He was 
standing almost on the slopes of 
the hillock, so that it shut out a 
large sector of his view. He lis- 
tened. The creature must be as 
close to the hillock on the other 
side as he was on this. 

He realized with a dreadful 
certainty that there was no sense 
in fleeing — not from an enemy 



88

he didn’t know a thing about. It 
might be able to clear fifty feet 
in one bound, for instance. On the 
other hand, it might have some 
limitation that could be exploited. 
There was only one thing for it. 

Accordingly, he edged his way 
round the intervening lump of 
ground. He came to the rim of it, 
thankful at least that whatever 
it was on the other side seemed 
not to have had the same idea. 
The clicking went on from the 
same direction, sinisterly and 
rhythmically. 

An outcropping of some freak- 
ish crystalline rock made a good 
vantage point. He crouched down, 
his heart thumping wildly, and 
peered round it. 

And there, in that yellow plain, 
under a green sun and a copper 
sky — was an old woman, a 
gentle-looking old soul, rocking 
away in a chair — knitting! 

T he old woman looked up 
suddenly; a pair of beady 
eyes plainly saw him. He stepped 
out from cover. 

The effect on the old lady was 
immediate. Her face broke into 
a toothless grin. \ 

“A-ah,” she quavered. “The col- 
lector. Come here, sir. I’ve been 
waiting a long time for you.” 
Norman approached her chair 
warily. 

“I’ve got them all at my cabin,” 
she told him excitedly. “All 

90 



packed and ready. Two hundred 
and thirty-five.” 

“Two hundred and thirty-five 
what?” Norman asked in a daze. 

“Why, chest protectors, of 
course.” Her old eyes narrowed. 
“Wait, maybe you’re a Rebel spy. 
I’ve heard tales of spies.” 

Norman looked around baf- 
fledly. Startled by the incongruity 
of a quite mad, but otherwise 
ordinary enough old woman in 
the midst of this utterly strange 
landscape, he hadn’t noticed what 
else might be visible on this side 
of the hillock. 

His numbed mind took in sev- 
eral things now. One was a cluster 
of cabins, white-painted and as 
ordinary as the old woman. An- 
other was more people. His im- 
mediate attention was taken by 
one striding purposefully toward 
him. It was a woman, clad in 
blouse and jodhpurs. The face, 
though young, looked as func- 
tional as the outfit. 

She halted, a couple of feet 
away, looking him over as if he 
were a horse. Then, before he 
could frame the questions he was 
bursting to ask, she said abruptly, 
“Anagram of cart horse.” 

Even in such bewildering cir- 
cumstances, it was almost reflex 
for Norman. “Why — er — or- 
chestra.” 

The girl nodded approvingly 
and stuck out a hand. “At last! 
I’d begun to give up hope. My

name’s Miss Hoff. Miss Hoff.” 
“Happy to meet you,” Norman 
replied automatically. “Mine’s 
Norman Woods.” 

The old woman pricked up her 
ears. “Woods, you say, son? Not 
kin of Colonel Woods of the Fifth 
New York Cavalry by any 
chance?” 

The girl drew Norman away. 
“She thinks the Civil War’s still 
on. It’s best to leave her alone.” 
“Civil War?” Norman echoed. 
“Then this is an asylum?” 

“Asylum?” said Miss Hoff. 
“Heavens, no! You’re in another 
dimension, that’s all.” 

“That’s all!” He looked around 
wildly. “Look, I’ve got to get 
back! I — ” 

Ijr E BROKE off. Miss Hoff was 
shaking her head slowly. 
“There is no way back, Mr. 
Woods.” 

“But there has to be.” His voice 
started to spiral up toward hys- 
teria. “This is all a dream. Yes, 
that’s it. I’ll wake up in a minute 
and — ” 

“Steady, steady,” said Miss 
Hoff. “Don’t disappoint me. You 
don’t want to get like him, do 
you?” 

Norman was aware of an old 
man, dressed in ancient breeches 
and buckled shoes. As he ambled 
past, Norman distinctly heard 
him muttering, “Where are they? 
I just walked round ’em and they 



vanished. What have they done 
with the horses?” 

Norman blinked and stared in 
the wake of the old man. He’d 
heard of him. But it couldn’t be. 
That had been — how many 
years ago? — a couple of cen- 
turies or more. 

“Bathurst’s always looking for 
the horses,” Miss Hoff said con- 
temptuously. “At least old Mrs. 
Lockhart hasn’t let it shake her 
from what she thinks is still her 
duty. It just demonstrates the su- 
perior adaptability of the female.” 
“Have it your way,” Norman 
said impatiently. “But will you 
kindly tell me just what I have 
to adapt myself to? How did I 
get here? And you? And the 
others?” 

“How? Because of visualization 
while following some intricate 
line of thought. I, for example, 
was working out a complex 
theorem in higher mathematics. 
Mrs. Lockhart was knitting com- 
forts for the troops. Unfortunate- 
ly she chose a rather complicated 
pattern. As for Bathurst, heaven 
knows what he was working out. 
I gave up asking long ago.” 

“But how can we all be here at 
the same time?” Norman ob- 
jected. “Somebody from the 
eighteenth Century and somebody 
from Civil War times — and us?” 
He laughed raggedly. “Or did you 
come from Ancient Rome?” 

Miss Hoff looked at him frigid- 



ly. “I was born in 1893. I was 
translated in 1906. I was some- 
thing of a child prodigy. The 
reason we can all be here at the 
same time is that time goes at 
only about a quarter of its normal 
rate in this world.” 

“But how is it you — almost 
seemed to be expecting me? And 
that anagram business, what was 
that? A password or something?” 
Miss Hoff smiled enigmatically. 
“That can wait for the time be- 
ing. Let me show you around our 
little settlement first. Oh, this is 
Jimmy.” She turned to a vacant- 
looking youth who had just come 
out of one of the cabins. “Say 
hello to Mr. Woods, Jimmy. He’s 
new here.” 

The youth looked at Norman 
for an uncomprehending moment, 
then shuffled on. 

“A sad case of mental retard- 
ment,” Miss Hoff commented. 
“But he’s willing enough.” 

“But how did he get across? I 
thought you said it was a matter 
of the mind being engaged in a 
complex problem.” 

M ISS HOFF stopped and fixed 
him with a steady eye. 
“That is something I’ve never 
been able to explain. Perhaps 
there’s a certain trigger level, 
higher or lower according to the 
mentality of the individual. Any- 
way, whatever the cause, the 
effect is a rare one, as witness the 



small number here — only five 
in a century and a half; six now 
with you. And there were only 
one or two before then. I dis- 
interred a few sets of bones to 
check what the natives told me.” 

“Natives?” Norman echoed in 
alarm. “What kind of natives?” 

“Oh, not human ones. But 
friendly. You’ll see one soon.” 

The tour of inspection took 
little time. The few cabins were 
comfortably, if primitively, fur- 
nished. Miss Hoff led him to her 
own. 

“And this is Feen,” she said as 
they entered. “He’s the only na- 
tive regularly here. The rest are 
busy building the city.” 

But Norman wasn’t listening; 
he was too busy gaping at the 
creature who stood deferentially 
before them. 

Under a face like the Cheshire 
Cat’s, the torso was passably hu- 
man. It was the lower appendages 
that were really odd — four 
stumpy legs on which the body 
stood upright as if on an under- 
carriage. 

“All done, ma’am,” Feen 
squeaked. 

“Good,” said Miss Hoff. “You 
may go.” 

Feen bowed low and retired. 
Miss Hoff gestured to Norman to 
sit down. He did so gratefully. A 
sudden thought occurred to him. 

“Where’s the other member of 
the happy band?” he asked.

Miss Hoffs face darkened. 
“He, Mr. Woods, is a disgrace to 
your sex. He spends all his time 
drinking.” 

Norman reflected that Miss 
Hoffs standards seemed alto- 
gether too high. If a man, ma- 
rooned in this outlandish place, 
took to drink, he had every right 
to. “How did he get across?” he 
asked. 

“The same way I did. He was 
a mathematician, too. A fine 
mind. But mind is no good with- 
out strength of character.” Her 
eye was on Norman. “That is why 
I hope you will prove worthy of 
my trust.” 

“Look,” Norman said, “don’t 
talk to me of trust. It seems to me 
I’m being asked to take a whale 
of a lot on trust myself. For in- 
stance, you told me there’s no 
way back. You also told me that 
you came over in 1906. So will 
you tell me how you happen to 
be wearing a nylon blouse?” 

H er composure flickered for 
a moment. Then she smiled 
thinly. “Very observant of you. 
I’m glad you are. But I didn’t 
want to explain everything until 
you were in a calmer frame of 
mind.” 

“And I shan’t be in that,” Nor- 
man told her, “until you do ex- 
plain. There is a way back, isn’t 
there?” 

“There is, Mr. Woods. I use it 



to bring back things we need. But 
it only works for me. It needs a 
knowledge of higher math and an 
unusual ability to visualize. You 
have to see your way back.” 

“I saw my way here,” he said 
doggedly. “I can see my way 
back.” 

She leaned back in her chair. 
“Try then. But you’ll be wasting 
your time. Imagine a forest and 
a thousand and one paths branch- 
ing from Point A. Only one of 
them reaches Point B. A man 
leaving B would be bound to 
reach A. But if he left A to reach 
B, the odds would be a thousand 
to one against him. A poor anal- 
ogy, but it may serve to prove to 
you that a return journey isn’t as 
easy as the one here.” 

Norman looked at her, his sus- 
picion withering into a despairing 
conviction that she was telling 
the truth. 

“Anyway,” she went on, “you’ll 
have better things to do. Natur- 
ally, I had a purpose in getting 
you here.” 

“Getting me here?” He stared 
at her. “You were expecting me 
then!” 

“Well, not exactly you, but 
someone. You see, it took a good 
bit of working out. I had some- 
how to lead a mind into the path. 
In the end, I had the idea of 
incorporating it in a crossword 
puzzle. Getting it accepted in the 
paper was the hardest part, but 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I managed it. You seem to be the 
only one who solved it.” 

He gaped at her, then col- 
lapsed, despite himself, in laugh- 
ter. “You mean — I won the 
prize? This — ” He flapped a 
helpless hand. 

Her reaction was plainly dis- 
approving. “This, Mr. Woods, is 
worth more than any Earthly 
prize. Here you have a great mis- 
sion. You, young and a man, are 
ideally suited — apart from a 
certain flippancy which I trust 
you will learn to curb. My main 
fear was that only another wom- 
an, or an old man, would have 
solved it. I would have had to try 
again.” 

Norman’s laughter halted. 
“How do you mean?” 

“Because,” she said calmly, 
“my aim is to build a new world 
here. It must be obvious to you 
that neither of the two males you 
have seen is suitable for the pur- 
pose. And the other one — ” she 
shuddered — “is disgusting.” 

I T TOOK several seconds for 
her meaning to grow clear. 
Then he recoiled visibly. 

Miss Hoff looked affronted. 
“The notion disturbs you?” 

“But I — I’m married,” he 
stuttered, grasping at the first ex- 
cuse handy to avoid the clutches 
of a female as cold and forbidding 
as this. 

“Nonsense. That’s in another 



world.” She fixed a stern eye on 
him, as if divining the true rea- 
son for his reaction. “And you can 
forget all the romantic absurdity 
of the so-called culture you left 
behind. It only diverted energies 
that could be better used in other 
directions, as well as obscuring 
the chaotic state of things there.” 
She leaned toward him. “Don’t 
you see the opportunity here? A 
chance to start all over again, to 
build such a civilization as Earth 
has never known — a rule of the 
intellect. The natives here will 
supply the manual labor gladly. 
Their whole delight in life is 
serving others. In fifty years, we 
can build a Utopia.” 

Her eyes gleaming, the severe- 
ly practical Miss Hoff seemed as 
near to emotion as he had yet 
seen her. The trouble was, he 
didn’t care for that particular 
emotion. And then a thought 
struck him that filled him with a 
blind and futile rage. 

“You fool!” he exploded. “You 
talk of intellect! Yet you snare 
me, uproot me, for some lunatic 
idea — and all the time it wasn’t 
necessary. You could have begun 
your dynasty on Earth. You 
didn’t need a man here.” 

“Do you think it would have 
been so easy?” she answered im- 
perturbably. “Not with the right 
kind of man, anyway. Besides, it 
won’t be just a one-time affair. 
And you will have other duties.

such as the upbringing of the 
children. Women will be liber- 
ated in this world. It’s laid down 
in the Code of Conduct. But that 
can wait until you’ve settled 
down. I have gone into the mat- 
ter scientifically. Procreation must 
be undertaken with a quiet mind.” 
Norman looked into her face 
and realized that she meant it — 
every word of it. She must have 
read it out of books. She had 
grown from child to woman in a 
world cut off from all the pleas- 
ures of civilization. All the time 
she must have been planning to 
this end. It was going to be some 
crackpot Utopia. And what would 
he be to posterity? Norman the 
First? Or Procreating Unit One? 
He shivered. 

‘"Meanwhile,” she said, “we eat 
and then to bed. I have a cabin 
prepared for you.” 

N orman lay awake for a long 
time, tired though he was, 
pondering on the spot he was in. 
It could have been worse, he 
supposed. Whatever Miss Hoff’s 
faults, she seemed to have organ- 
ized things well. The cabins were 
comfortable and pleasant. The 
supper had been uncooked and 
vegetarian — that was also in the 
Code of Conduct, she told him — 
but it had been palatable. 

But it was the sheer wrench of 
things that hurt. He was com- 
pletely lacking in any Robinson 



Crusoe aptitudes. His daily round, 
quiet and humble as it may have 
been, had been enough; he had 
been content. He felt a wave of 
self-pity flood through him — a 
heartfelt regret that he’d ever set 
eyes on that damned puzzle. 

But it was too late now, he told 
himself. He’d have to accept 
things. The thought that that in- 
cluded mating with the formid- 
able Miss Hoff brought him out 
in a cold sweat. Wait, though! He 
didn’t have to play ball! But his 
efforts to tell himself that weren’t 
very successful. He had a strong 
suspicion that Miss Hoff had 
means of enforcing her will. She 
was sure to have the natives on 
her side. She had probably bought 
them over with baubles she 
brought back from Earth. 

He wondered sleepily what she 
used for money on those trips. 
Perhaps this place was crawling 
with gold; perhaps . 

It seemed that he had only just 
dropped off to sleep when he felt 
a hand shaking him by the shoul- 
der. He blinked up indignantly. 

A man stood over him, holding 
a lantern. 

‘"Who are you?” Norman de- 
manded. 

“Ambrose Gedge,” the man 
said. “I was otherwise engaged 
when you arrived.” 

Norman’s nostrils bore to his 
sleep-fuddled brain a strong 
aroma of alcohol. So this was the 



other member of the settlement. 
“Pleased to meet you,” he grum- 
bled. “But did you have to come 
to say hello in the middle of the 
night?” He turned over. 

“But I came to say good-by.” 
The man’s voice was thick. “And 
to wish you good luck. I’m going 
off to the mountains. I couldn’t 
stand the sight of you and — and 
Bertha — together.” 

Norman turned back. “Bertha?” 
“Miss Hoff.” Gedge, a tubby 
red-faced man, seemed overcome 
with emotion. “I envy you your 
luck, old man.” 

“Luck?” Norman echoed. 

“Of course. A whole little world 
of your own. And Bertha." He 
sighed. “What a type! So proud, 
so masterly.” 

M arveling at the wide 

range of people’s tastes, 
Norman stared at him. 

“Only one trouble with her,” 
Gedge went on, “she’s too damn 
finicky. First day I was here, I 
thought I was going to have fun 
— but that put Bertha right off; 
That’s what drove me to the bot- 
tle. That put her off even more. 
A vicious circle, my friend.” He 
shook his head sadly. “I thought 
she was coming ’round to my way 
of thinking, but then she got this 
crossword plan. Now my chances 
are finished.” 

“You’re welcome to her,” Nor- 
man said, “and to this place. I’d 



give my right arm to get away.” 
“You would?” Gedge seized 
him by the shoulder. “Well, you 
can if you want to.” 

Norman jerked upright, blink- 
ing unbelievingly at him. “But 
Miss Hoff said it needed higher 
math and visualization. I can vis- 
ualize, but I’m not much good at 
math.” 

Gedge winked. “You can get a 
headache from higher math; you 
can also get it from hitting your- 
self over the head with a mallet. 
Come over to my cabin. I’ll show 
you something.” 

Wide awake now, Norman 
dressed hurriedly and followed 
Gedge, telling himself not to hope 
too much, that it might all be the 
ravings of a drunk. 

Dawn was breaking. Nobody 
else was in sight. Gedge showed 
Norman into his cabin. He fer- 
reted under his bed, fetched out 
something covered in cloth and 
unwrapped it. 

The first sight of it half-con- 
firmed Norman’s fears. It was a 
framework of sticks, lashed to- 
gether in a complicated and seem- 
ingly purpose’ess structure. 

“This,” said Gedge, “is the way 
back. It’s a visual aid. Getting 
back is harder, as Bertha prob- 
ably told you. But she doesn’t 
know that I found it my way. 
The only thing is that you have 
to get pretty drunk for it to 
work.”

“Anything,” said Norman fer- 
vently. 

“Good.” Gedge thrust a large 
earthenware bottle at him. Nor- 
man took a gulp and coughed. It 
was fiery stuff. 

“Only native rotgut, I’m afraid,” 
the other said apologetically. 
“Bertha refuses to bring me any 
real stuff back with her.” 

“But can’t you bring your own 
back?” 

“Hah, wish I could. I only tried 
it once. I nearly got arrested back 
there. It seems that when I dis- 
appeared, people thought I’d gone 
behind the Iron Curtain. And 
since I was engaged in a secret 
project, that makes it highly un- 
safe to go back.” 

1^ ORMAN remembered now 
■*- ^ the uproar the case had 
caused several years back. He 
offered his sympathies. 

“It was a dog’s life anyway,” 
Gedge said indifferently. “I only 
thought this gadget up so I 
wouldn’t be dependent on Bertha 
for supplies. But you get used to 
even to this stuff. Hey, drink 
up!” 

“I’m going as fast as I can,” 
said Norman. “I’m not a drinking 
man.” He took another gulp. “Is 
it any good trying now?” 

“Lord, no. You’ve got to get 
pickled. Come on, drink.” 

Norman dutifully drained the 
bottle. Gedge handed him an-

other, chuckling. “I can’t wait to 
see Bertha’s face when she finds 
you’re gone.” He treated himself 
to a generous swig at the thought 
“I bet she’ll — ” 

He broke off, startled, as a 
rapping sounded on the door. 

“Bertha!” he whispered hoarse- 
ly. “Quick, hide behind the door.” 
Norman jumped to it. Gedge 
opened the door cautiously. 

“Ah, your good pardon, sir,” 
came a quavering voice. “But 
have you seen a coach and 
horses? I was — ” 

Norman heard Gedge’s breath 
exhaled in a shuddering sigh. 
“They went thataway,” he said. 

G edge turned back, sweating 
heavily. “Come on, drink up. 
We’ve got no time to lose. I can’t 
stand the strain.” 

Norman choked down another 
mouthful. “But how do I know 
where I’ll get back? I mean he 
disha — hey, hear that? We’re 
getting somewhere! But I mean 
he disappeared in Europe. What 
if I turn up in the middle of the 
Atlantic?” 

“No fear of that, old man. I’ve 
mapped out the contangency. All 
of Earth touches only a small 
area here. Where do you want to 
get back to?” 

“New York.” 

“Mm — well, we can arrange 
that. Though we’d better make 
it out in the country just to be on 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the safe side. The map’s over 
there, under my pillow. Get it, 
will you?” 

Norman didn’t realize until he 
staggered that this was a test. 

“Good,” said Gedge. “That 
ought to do it. Let’s get outside. 
We’ll take a bottle apiece to 
make sure.” 

Though it was quite light now, 
the coast seemed clear as they 
picked their way between the 
dunes. 

“Well, take one for the road,” 
said Gedge. “Now — look at this.” 

Norman squinted at the gad- 
get. 

“Start from this point. Now 
follow to this one. See? No, don’t 
close one eye — that won’t do. 
Now follow from one point to the 
next.” 

Norman did as he was told. 
But all he felt was dizziness. “It’s 
no good,” he said after a couple 
of minutes effort. 

“Keep at it,” Gedge said. 
“Wait — ” he cocked an ear — 
“what was that? No, keep on 
looking.” He lurched over to the 
outcropping of rock and peered 
around it. _ 

He turned back instantly, his 
face white. “For heaven’s sake, 
hurry! It’s Bertha. She must have 
missed you.” 

Norman tried again. From one 
joint of the gadget to the next, 
his eyes followed feverishly. His 
head spun. “It’s no good,” he

groaned. He staggered. And then 
he seemed to be falling, falling . 

T he NEXT he knew, he was 
staring blearily up at a blue- 
uniformed figure. 

“Where am I?” he asked weakly. 
“You’re in South Orange police 
station, bud. Boy, were you tight! 
You’ll have some explaining to 
do to the judge in the morning.” 
“Judge?” said Norman joyous- 
ly. He was back then! 

He struggled to a sitting posi- 
tion, but the effort was too brutal. 
He raised a hand to his splitting 
head. 

The cop looked at him oddly. 
“Well, if the thought of the judge 
makes you so happy, you’ll like 
knowing that you have some ex- 
plaining to do -before you meet 
him. The call’s been out for you 
for two days. The little lady’s on 
her way here now.” 

Two days? Of course, the time 
rate. But Ella? How could he 
start explaining? 

“Seems she left you doin’ a 
crossword puzzle or somethin’.” 
The cop scratched his head. “I’ve 
heard of queer things drivin’ a 
man to drink, but — ” 

“That was the last time,” said 
Norman devoutly. “Never again.” 
“Yeah, that’s what they all 
say.” 

“I didn’t mean drinking,” said 
Norman.

YOUR SINS AND MINE by 
Taylor Caldwell. Gold Medal 
Books, 25c 

IITISS Caldwell has still not 
written a science fiction 
book. Instead, this is pure fan- 
tasy, envisioning a near future in 
which God is fed up with the mur- 
derous antics of Man and poisons 
the Earth against him. There is 
no rain and nothing edible will 
grow. The fertile lands are over- 
grown with a weed that harbors a 
huge poisonous insect whose bite 
is fatal. Food supplies are being 
rapidly depleted.

The situation is worldwide, but 
censorship in the various coun- 
tries prohibits the printing of any 
information. Delegates still argue 
in the United Nations, A- and H- 
bombs are still boastfully ex- 
ploded. 

The story is told by a young 
married veteran whose father, a 
patient. Joblike tower of strength, 
is the only one who recognizes the 
pestilence as Divine Retribution. 
Maybe you or I would quibble 
with Miss Caldwell’s picture of 
Earth abandoned and the be- 
havior of the starving populace 
or the idea of Divine Retribution. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 






However, many stretches of the 
book have a Biblical power. 

All in all, a disturbing plea for 
sanity and peace. No argument 
there, at least. 

REPORT ON THE STATUS 
QUO by Terence Roberts. Merlin 
Press, Inc., $2.50 

T he title is completely descrip- 
tive of the book. This strange, 
yet amusing little story is written 
in the form of a report by the sec- 
retary of the Combined Scientific 
Societies of the U. S. A. to the 
Secretary of Science, evidently a 
new Cabinet post, on April 16, 
1961. 

It concerns the Status Quo, but 
not Ihe one we are familiar with, 
being a preliminary account in 
advance of the full scientific re- 
ports of the events that led to the 
disorganization of the world. 

It appears that in 1958 and ’59, 
while the rest of the world was 
busily engaged in WW III, an 
unprecedented rainy dry season 
as well as a very rainy rainy sea- 
son washed away the topsoil of 
the Hinche Plateau in the in- 
terior of Haiti. The bluish Nitro- 
earth thus exposed is the cause 
of all the trouble. It is Mesozoic 
in origin, having been covered 
these past millions of years, but 
nowhere on Earth so close to the 
surface as in this spot in Haiti. 
Due to the global preoccupa- 

★ ★ ★ ★ ★ SHELF 



tion with the war, no one except 
James Carstairs, a sociologist, and 
Sylvia Rendle, a journalist, who 
were unfortunate enough to be 
marooned on the plateau for a 
year, realized that Man was about 
to lose his unchallenged grip on 
the planet. Exposed to the revita- 
lizing sunshine, the Nitro-earth is 
giving up its hoarded store of 
dinosaur eggs and parasitic dis- 
eases which disappeared millions 
of years ago. 

The report is a personalized ac- 
count of the beginning of this 
struggle against Nature. Very im- 
pressive, too, both in scholarship 
and tension. 

THE EDGE OF THE SEA by 
Rachel Carson. Houghton Mifflin 
Co., $3.95 

W iERE I live — Far Rocka- 
way, on Long Island, N. Y. 
we have more sea than any- 
thing else except trouble with the 
L. I. R. R. Of the two. I’ll take the 
sea any time — especially the sea 
as Rachel Carson describes it 
Miss Carson takes us into 
many of her intimate seashore 
spots and shows us wonders 
there that we never would suspect 
existed in such barren surround- 
ings. 

I recall one day this year that 
my kids and I watched a tremen- 
dous horde of egg-shaped mole 
crabs, uprooted by successive 




101 




waves, burrowing simultaneously 
until, in a flash, there was nothing 
to be seen but sand and a reced- 
ing wave, leaving a sense of illu- 
sion. From Miss Carson’s descrip- 
tion of these creatures, I would 
swear that she was looking over 
my shoulder and reading my re- 
actions. 

It is a fascinating book that has 
us waiting impatiently for warm 
weekends to return so that we can 
discover other marvels for our- 
selves. It is also a beautiful book, 
with excellent illustrations by 
Bob Hines of U. S. Fish 8s Wild- 
life Service on almost every page. 
It doesn’t have the sweep and 
grandeur of The Sea Around Us, 
but neither does its subject mat- 
ter. It’s a homy book about salt- 
water neighbors.

Pherson has written, too. In sim- 
ple, clear fashion, it takes the 
novice through the heavens, start- 
ing with the Northern Stars, 
which change position least 
throughout the year. From them, 
after pointing out unmistakable 
signposts, he proceeds to the con- 
stellations, taking them one by 
one and listing the items of in- 
terest in each, following the sea- 



sonal changes of the sky. 

An added bonus is a section of 
star maps at the end, which delin- 
eates the important constellations 
and denotes the magnitude of the 
constituent stars. 



FRONTIERS OF ASTRONO- 
MY by Fred Hoyle. Harper & 
Brothers, $5.00 



A handsome and fascinating 
book indeed. The style is 
attractive and often witty, espe- 
cially in the information and the- 
ories the author blithely tosses 
about. Naturally you know that 
Mother Earth is now thought to 
be four billion years old instead 
of two — but that means that the 
gal we’ve been stuck on all our 
life turns out to be twice as old 
as we thought. 

Not only did Hoyle disillusion 
me thusly, but he claims that the 
Earth did not start out as a mol- 
ten sphere, as we had been taught, 
but as an agglomeration of cold 
bodies that stuck together and 
gradually squeezed the lighter el- 
ements to the surface. 

He also theorizes that hydro- 
carbons existed before the Earth 
and that far more is trapped be- 
low the surface than is suspected. 

Hoyle really comes into his 
own, though, on the cosmic scale 
with the generation of galaxies! 

The book pictorially is on the 
same grand scale as the text, with

REVOLT ON ALPHA C by 
Robert Silver berg. Thomas Y. 
Crowell Company, $2.00 

T his is a book that I would 
have liked when I was a 
youngster. Silverberg knows his 
audience and they’re his equals, 
as they should be, while he re- 
lates his fast-moving story of a 
new space cadet caught up in a 
series of events that prove al- 
most too much for his divided 
loyalty. 

Larry Stark is the cadet, son 
of a commander in the Patrol and 
convinced through his training 
that Earth can do no wrong, that 
even the Jovian colonial revolt, 
quelled bloodily by Terra, was in 
no way caused by Earth. 

His friend on his shakedown 
cruise to Alpha Centauri is a Mar- 
tian youth, loyal to the Patrol but 
wise enough to see the justice of 
the colonies’ position. 

When they arrive at Alpha C 
IV, they find that three of the 
four settlements have revolted 
against Earth rule. And when 
Larry sees banners with slogans 
like “No Taxation without Rep- 
resentation,” they awaken in him 
an understanding of history that 
kids will excitedly share. 



MARTIN AND HIS FRIEND 
FROM OUTER SPACE by Ivo 
Duka and Helena Kolda. Harper 
8s Brothers, $2.50 

T his book could be a transcrip- 
tion of any modern child’s 
dreams. It was almost impossible 
for me to tear it it of the avid 
hands of my family in order to 
do this review. 

An average boy, Martin, who 
could be you — at an early age, 
of course — builds himself a con- 
traption of tin-foil, candy boxes, 
radio tubes, Slinky the spring and 
his Space Helmet. Only, Joy of 
Joys, it works! 

He establishes communication 
with a golden-haired beauty from 
Marinoid, Saturn’s Moon of the 
Sea, on which there is no solid 
land. They make a date to meet 
at Battery Park via matter trans- 
ference and then proceed to have 
one heckuva adventurous day at 
Coney Island. 

Martin’s broke, but his gal is 
a real golden-hair. They hock a 
lock, attracting the greedy atten- 
tion of a lurking cad who chases 
them throughout the day for the 
gold of her hair. Martin thwarts 
the blackguard in true Boy-hero 
style. 

The photos by Miss Kolda are 
done in wonderful keeping with 
the joyful make-believe spirit of 
the book.

Slave Ship Conclusion 

By FREDERIK POHL 
Here was the end product of this war that 
was not a war — on entire naval task force 
to protect some dogs and apes and seals! 




SYNOPSIS 

L ogan moeller is my 

name, Lieutenant, j.g., UJf. 
Naval Reserve. I was a 
combat officer of the line in what 
we laughingly called the Cold 
War — laughingly because, with a 
million casualties a year, it wasn’t 
very cold; and because, when you 
stopped and looked around, it 
wasn’t exactly a war. How can 
you have a war without an en- 
emy? 

The Caodais weren’t a coun- 
try; they were a religion that had 
swept up out of Indo-China, over- 
run Asia, Oceania and Africa, and 
were obviously well on the way 
to adding the rest of the world. 
You can’t declare war on a reli- 
gion, can you? And so it wasn’t 
war, but meanwhile we fought 
and died and took prisoners. 

Elsie, for instance, was only 
one prisoner out of hundreds of

thousands — but she was the one 
that counted with me because she 
was my wife. She had volunteered, 
months before the universal draft 
could have caught her, and she 
had been captured. While I was 
on combat duty at sea, it wasn’t 
so bad — I had other things on my 
mind. But then I was transferred 
— to a strange shore station: 

Project Mako, where it 
seemed COMINCH wanted us to 
learn how to talk to animals. 
What did they have to do with 
i fighting the Caodais?

noye Armee, now, since the Red 
Army no longer existed, a mili- 
tary attache of the People’s Dem- 
ocratic Tsarist Republican Rus- 
sian Government-in-Exile, was as- 
signed to Project Mako because, 
apparently, his mother had been 
one of Pavlov’s assistants decades 
before. With him, I managed to 
get somewhere with the actual 
task of manning a fighting sub- 
marine with animals and it began 
to seem that our project might 
get somewhere. But the Cold War 
suddenly began hotting up. Worst 
of all was something called: 

The Glotch — “unidentified 
ballistic phenomenon, presumably 
hostile.” It was a kind of radiation 
burn that killed, almost every 
time, and it struck anywhere. If 
the Caodais had a weapon like 
that, it was the end of the war — 
unless we could knock out that 
weapon. So reasoned COMINCH 
and he plucked Semyon and me 
and half a dozen of our animals 
out of Project Mako and put us 
on a task force to strike at what 
Intelligence believed to be Cao- 
dai headquarters for the new wea- 
pon. Our objective was Madagas- 
car — and Elsie was interned on 
Zanzibar, and the map showed it 
to be only a hair away. But there 
was a girl, a commissioned strip- 
per in a government - operated 
nightclub nearby, where she had 
been named: 

Nina Merriam; now she

turned up again — no longer com- 
missioned but an enlisted woman, 
no longer a stripper but a mess 
attendant in the aircraft carrier 
Monmouth’s wardroom — and no 
longer named Nina Merriam! I 
dragged her to the executive offi- 
cer’s cabin to have her arrested as 
a spy, but general quarters sound- 
ed; we were in Caodai waters and 
a bandit flotilla showed up in our 
sonars!

rpHE LIEUTENANT was on 
his way to his battle station 
before the klaxon had stopped 
blaring. The exec was a moment 
slower, but not because he was 
paying any attention to us. He 
bellowed something into his in- 
tercom, listened for a second, bel- 
lowed again, and was gone. There 
was no one left but the girl and 
me. 

She said urgently: “Let me go. 
Lieutenant! You’ve got this all 
wrong. I’ve got to get out of here 
and — ” 

I said; “Shut up!” I was feeling 
jittery. General quarters is a pow- 
erful voice of command. I had no 
battle station on Monmouth; I 
was supercargo, as useless in an 
engagement and as undesirable as 
the wardroom silver the old sur- 
face ships used to jettison before 
a fight. 

But I didn’t want to be useless; 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I wanted to respond to the alarm, 
and all I could do was stay here 
and look ugly at a young girl. 
Bandits in fleet strength! It wasn’t 
even a wanderer on picket duty 
or a cruising raider that we might 
hope to swamp before it could 
' transmit a signal. It meant fleet 
action if they spotted us — and we 
I were big enough for anyone to 
1 spot. 

I felt the angle of the deck 
change and, simultaneously, a 
{ slowing in the throb of the screws. 
I could see in my mind just what 
was happening: We were rebal- 
lasting our tanks, tipping our div- 
ing fins, slowing our propellers to 
a gentle wash as we headed for 
the bottom. 

Under a good thick blanket of 
the dense, cold Antarctic Deep 
water, we might not be spotted. 
Sonar echoes took odd bounces 
off the interfaces between layers 
of water of differing densities and 
of all the water in the Earth’s 
oceans, Antarctic Deep made the 
sharpest, cleanest interface. That 
much, at least, was good. 

T he girl was saying: “I tell 
you one more time. Lieuten- 
ant — get out of my way. That’s a 
direct order!” 

“What?” I stared at tier. I was 
between her and the door, and I 
was going to stay there. It would 
have been nice if I had had a 
weapon. I felt a little foolish. 



standing there with • my bare 
hands hanging at my sides, but of 
course I shouldn’t really need any 
more than bare hands to subdue 
a hundred-and-five-pound girl. I 
said: “Fd appreciate it if you’d 
shut up until the exec gets back. 
But you’re not leaving here, un- 
derstand that.” 

“I’m not a Cow-dye, you idiot! 
I’m Nina Willette of Navy Intelli- 
gence and you’re keeping me 
from the most important job I’ve 
ever done!” 

she took a deep breath and 
fought for control of herself. She 
was, all at once, superbly beauti- 
ful as she stood glaring at me, her 
shoulders thrown back, her eyes 
filled with fury, and I suppose she 
knew it very well. They are ac- 
tors by trade, these cloak-and- 
dagger people; how was a simple 
line officer like myself to know 
whether she was telling the truth 
or not? 

She said, with an effort: “Look, 
Lieutenant, I’ll explain it to you. 
I’m Counter-intelligence. I was on 
security duty when I was a strip- 
per at Boca Raton. I’m on secu- 
rity duty now. There are paci- 
fists in Monmouth’s complement, 
Moeller! Do you know what that 
means? Right now, we’re at battle 
stations. This is the time when I 
ought to be out on the prowl, 
making sure everybody’s at his 
station, looking for trouble before 
it starts — and I’m here waiting

for a fat-headed j.g. to make up 
his mind to let me go. Get out of 
my way!” 

“Good try,” I said, but I was 
shaken. “Stay where you are.” 
Well, she was some kind of 
spy or counter-spy, but she was 
only a girl, and a small one and a 
young one at that. All of a sud- 
den, her eyes filled with tears. She 
sobbed and leaned blindly for- 
ward; instinctively, I reached out 
to help her. She clung to me, 
weeping, and it was like holding 
a fragrant, sad flower. 

I hadn’t known that enlisted 
women used perfume. The exec 
and the encroaching Caodais 
seemed very remote and I found 
myself patting her head and say- 
ing soothing things. 

And then the roof fell in. 

T CAME to with a lump behind 
my right ear and there was no 
one in the exec’s office but me; 
Nina whatever - her - name - was 
was gone. Lord knows what she 
hit me with, but it was nothing to 
what the exec hit me with when 
he came back for a brief racing 
second and found me standing 
dopily in the middle of the floor. 
I don’t suppose he said more than 
twenty words to me, but every 
one of them dug deep under the 
skin and festered. 

It seems that she was indeed 
Naval Intelligence. And a full 
commander at that.

I saluted empty air; he was 
gone already. It seemed like a 
good place to be out of, so I left. 
In any case, even though I didn’t 
have a real battle station, there 
was a place where I was supposed 
to be. 

Semyon and I had been as- 
signed a whaleboat, deep in the 
lower decks of the carrier, far be- 
low even the aircraft hangars, be- 
low the engineering sections, in 
the steel belly of the ship, sur- 
rounded by jet fuel for the air- 
craft and diesel oil for the torps 
and auxiliaries. It was where the 
animals were kept, for the whale- 
boat would be our assault vessel 
for the landing on Madagascar — 
if we ever got that far. And it 
was where I was supposed to be 
in any action. 

I headed for it through the 
roaring tumult of a capital ship 
at general quarters. There was 
plenty of noise aboard Monmouth 
just then, but it was mostly vocal 
— the racket of the loud-hailers, 
the sharp orders of the officers 
with working parties, the rattle of 
sighting orders as I passed the 
fire-control compartments. 

But the engines were a gentle 
whisper, barely enough to main- 
tain steerage way. For human 
voices would not penetrate the 
ship’s hull to give us away to the 
enemies around us in the dense, 
chill water draining off the Ant- 
arctic ice pack, but the sounds of

our screws most surely would. We 
were well into the Indian Ocean, 
surrounded by Caodai Africa, 
Caodai Asia and the inhospitable 
ice. The Caodais thought of it as 
their private lake, as we did the 
Caribbean, and with just as much 
reason. Even if the sighted Cao- 
!dai vessels missed us, there would 
be others. 

Of course, we did have the cur- 
tain of the thermoplane over our 
heads and that was a help. But it 
iwas as helpful to the Caodais now 
as to us. I was sympathizing with 
the men at the sonar stations, 
pinging into the dark deeps, chart- 
ing and weighing the echoes that 
came back. There would be a 
vhgue splash of light in the sonar 
screen, warped by distance, al- 
most obliterated by the thermo- 
' plane. Was it a blue whale, a 
school of fish — or a Caodai sub? 

Our real advantage was that 
• we could fairly assume any sight- 
ing was a sub, whereas they might 
not expect to find us here. 

S EMYON WAS already in the 
whaleboat. He was sitting 
with the puppies in his lap, talk- 
ing nervously tP Josie. He blinked 
at me as I slid in through the en- 
trance hatch. 

He scrambled to his feet and 
then: “Oh,” he said in relief, “it is 
you, Logan. I did not know but 
perhaps it was an admiral. In 
Krasnoye Armee — ” 



“ — ^there were no admirals,” I 
finished for him. “Are the animals 
all right?” 

“Oh,” he said dourly, “they will 
perhaps survive, if the rest of us 
do. Have you news, Logan? Are 
we to be in combat?” 

“Can’t you hear the squawk- 
box?” 

It was rattling a repetition of 
what it had been saying, at inter- 
vals, ever since the first alarm: 
“Remain at stations. We have lost 
sonar contact, but the audic listen- 
ing posts indicate the enemy still 
on course.” Which meant that we 
had stopped pinging the waters 
for fear of having them hear our 
own sonars, but our directional 
microphones had a fix on the Cao- 
dai screws, not muffled as ours 
were because, it appeared, they 
did not know we were around. 

That was good. Now if only 
they didn’t close to a point where 
even the curtain between the 
dense, cold water and the bottom 
and the lighter, warmer, saltier 
layers above no longer screened 
us from their sonars. 

Semyon sat down and lifted 
the puppies into his lap. He 
clucked over them and petted 
them. “Always jumping up and 
down,” he complained. “Is never 
a moment to sit, or to play chess, 
or merely to think. Ah, Irkutsk, 
if only I could see you once again! 
How precious the memory — ” 
His voice trailed off; he was 



SLAVE SHIP

staring past me at the entrance 
hatch. I turned and there was 
Nina Willette-or-whatever. She 
had with her the surly officer 
named Wilmington and she also 
had a wide-mouthed, dangerous- 
looking gim in her hand. 

I said dazedly, “Lieutenant Ti- 
mayazev. Commander Willette.” 

Semyon pushed the puppies off 
his lap and stood up to give her a 
ramrod Red Army salute, hand 
twanging wide at the temple like 
the ancient Coldstream Guards. 
But he glanced at me inquiringly 
at the same time. 

I started to explain, but the girl 
cut me off. “Inside, Winnington,” 
she said, and gestured with the 
gun. And to me: “Sorry to barge 
in like this, but I had to get him 
out of the way. They’d tear him 
to pieces back in the fire-control 
room.” 

■^INNINGTON ONLY looked 
” even more sullen. He walked 
casually over to the navigator’s 
desk, pushed Josie onto the floor 
and sat. “You’ve got no right to 
do this,” he observed flatly. 

“No rightl” she blazed, but 
Semyon outblazed her. 

“SvoloctU” he roared at Win- 
nington. “Leave dog alone! She 
was not hurting you, the dog!” 
Josie whined her complaints; and 
then, as she caught the timbre of 
her boss’s voice, barked threaten- 
ingly: “Go away! Go away!” 



Winnington looked more 
alarmed at Semyon and the dog 
than he had at Nina’s gun. “Get 
these characters off me,” he ap- 
pealed to her. 

“I ought to let the dog take a 
bite,” she answered. “But we’ll 
save you for better things.” She 
sat down, looking drained, and 
glanced at me. “Congratulations, 
Lieutenant,” she said. “You al- 
most loused things up, but not 
quite. I got to Winnington just 
as he was about to pull the trig- 
ger on the Caodais.” 

He said matter - of -factly: “I 
was setting up range and vectors. 
That’s all. I wouldn’t have fired 
without an order.” 

She laughed. “Of course not 
And you’re not a pacifist, either, 
are you?” 

“Pacifist?” I said, shocked. And 
Semyon blared: “Patchifist? This 
one, a patchifist? Logan, leave me 
turn Josie loose on him! Is first 
patchifist I have ever in ihy 
whole life seen!” 

“Lay off,” I begged him. “Tell 
me about it Nina — Commander, 

I mean.” 

“Nina will do,” she said wea- 
rily. “That’s all there is to tell. I 
was assigned to keep an eye on 
him; he’s been under surveillance 
for a long time. But he’s smart. 
He didn’t make a move-rruntil it 
could be a big one. If I had been 
five seconds later, he would have 
salvoed his whole battery at the 



Caodais — and they would have 
blown us right out of the water 
ten minutes later.” 

Winnington laughed sharply, 
but he didn’t say anything. He 
was watching Semyon, cradling 
Josie in his arms and murmuring 
to her in Dog, with what ap- 
peared to be genuine amusement. 

A pacifist! I’d seen traces of 
their work, a newspaper report of 
a time bomb at the Caodai lega- 
tion, an Army installation myste- 
riously ablaze, but as far as I 
knew, I had never seen one in the 
flesh. And here was Winnington, 
my surly bridge partner of the 
wardroom, revealed as an authen- 
tic pacifist! It was like seeing a 
cobra emerging from a washstand 
drain — the essence of evil where 
only familiar and safe things 
f should be. 

I started to question her, but 
the rattle of the loud-hailers in 
the passageway stopped me. 
There was a new tone to the 
bridge talker’s voice: “Attention 
on deck! All hands to Condition 
Baker! Bandits past closest point 
of contact and holding steady on 
course.” And then, humanly: 
“They missed us!” 

YOU see, patchifist,” Sem- 
^ yon said nastily, “you have 
lost your chance!” 

“Leave him alone,” I told him. 
There was tramping and talking 
in the passageways as the dam- 

SIAVE SHIP 



age-control parties came up from 
the fuel tanks, where they had 
been waiting for possible Caodai 
hits and almost certain cremation 
if one occurred. They looked 
hardly human in their anti-flash 
face paint and heavy hoods. Josie, 
spying them from the entrance 
hatch, barked like a rabid animal. 

“Hush!” said Semyon to her, 
and repeated the order in Dog 
whine. 

I asked Nina Willette: “Now 
what? Do you want me to escort 
you back to the exec’s office with 
this one?” 

“Give us ten minutes,” she said. 
“Let them cool off a little. We 
pretty near had a lynching when 
I arrested him.” 

Winnington might not even 
have heard her; he continued to 
watch Semyon try to soothe the 
disturbed dogs, still with the air 
of amused detachment. He bent 
over casually to remove one of 
the puppies from his shoes and 
Josie, the vigilant mother, sprang 
for him. 

Semyon made a grab and 
caught her, yipping, by the tail, 
while the puppies clamored at 
him. ‘Tortune pulverize the for- 
tune-pulverized beasts!” Semyon 
snarled. “Hush, now! Hush!” And 
he went on to bawl them out in 
Dog. 

Nina said approvingly: “He 
barks like a native.” Semyon 
glowered at her briefly. But only 



110

briefly, because no mere human 
distraction could keep him from 
animals. 

“All right, all right!” he said, in 
a mock-furious motherly growl. 
“Semyon will tell you a story. Be 
calm! A nice story, I promise it.” 
He had spoken in English, but the 
dogs, and even the seals behind 
their bars, reacted at once. Ap- 
parently they recognized the 
word “story,” which told me a lit- 
tle something I hadn’t known be- 
fore about why Semyon so fre- 
quently slipped back to the ani- 
mal quarters for a few moments 
before he went to bed. 

Winnington stared in disgusted 
unbelief and Nina almost explod- 
ed. Well, it was a mad sight: 
There were the animals, yapping 
with joy; there was Semyon, ob- 
livious of us all; and there were 
Nina and Winnington, watching 
a full-grown fighting man tell bed- 
time stories to a brood of animals. 
It must have been even funnier 
to them than it was to me. 

CEMYON HAD a mixed audi- 

ence. It was like tucking a six- 
year-old and a three-year-old into 
bed at the same time. One story 
will more or less do for both of 
them, but the differences in vo- 
cabulary mean you have to dou- 
ble up on the story as you go 
along — something like the facing 
Hebrew and English pages in the 
Holy Book they read from at the 

m 



Christmas Feast of Lights. 

Semyon squatted down among 
the dogs, next to the seal pen, and 
then it was a steady stream of 
bark-whine-sniff-and-twitch, shiv- 
er-and-whine, grimace-and-growl. 
The animals were delighted; they 
followed the story with frantic 
absorption. 

And Nina was delighted, too. 
After the first incredulous stare, 
she stuffed a handkerchief to her 
mouth and kept it there, eyes on 
Semyon. She managed not to 
laugh out loud, which is more 
than I could say for Winnington. 

But Semyon was oblivious. It 
was the longest monologue in any 
animal tongue I have ever heard, 
and I realized that it accounted 
for a lot in the comparative flu- 
ency Semyon had over me in 
talking with the dogs; it must 
have been splendid practice. I 
watched him admiringly as he 
improvised substitutes for words 
that did not exist, wagging the tail 
he didn’t have, making the croupy 
barks that are Seal punctuation. 
When he finished, the animals 
applauded wildly. 

And so did Nina. “Thank you 
very much,” she said sincerely, 
regaining her self-control. 

Semyon asked suspiciously: 
“For what, thanks?” 

“For telling us the story of Lit- 
tle Red Riding Hood. I wouldn’t 
have missed it for the world.” 

He looked puzzled. “Oh, no, 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Commander. Was not Riding 
Hood. How would that be tactful? 
Was Goldilocks and Three Bears, 
don’t you see?” 

He stopped, indignant; Nina 
had lost her self-control com- 
pletely on that one. And when she 
laughed, that broke me up. 

But it didn’t last. Nina stopped 
short and blinked at me. “What 
was that?” 

I felt it, too. The deck pulsed 
underneath us. A pause, and it 
pulsed again, as though a blue 
whale were nuzzling playfully up 
to Monmouth. 

But it was no whale, I knew. I 
had felt the same gentle pulsing 
on Spruance', I knew the feel of 
the recoil as a ship’s main batter- 
ies loosed against an enemy. 

Winnington grated triumphant- 
ly: “Caught me, did you? But 
maybe there was somebody you 
missed!” 

Someone had salvoed a burst 
of at least a dozen missiles. If we 
had been hiding, we weren’t hid- 
ing any more; those missiles were 
laid on course at the fat and ig- 
norant Caodais as they waddled 
blissfully away from us. 

But they wouldn’t be waddling 
any more. 

XV 

I T WAS bad. Worse than we 
figured. While the four of us 
and the animals waited in the 



whaleboat, the loud-hailers roared 
orders and the ship lurched con- 
tinually against the recoil of mis- 
siles leaving for Caodai targets. 
And then there was a shudder 
that was not a missile leaving the 
tubes. 

A Caodai torpedo had ex- 
ploded against our deflection net, 
close enough to jar us all, and 
then another, and more, and one 
final one that was not against the 
net but against the hull of Mon- 
mouth. 

We were hit, and badly. 

And even that was not^the end. 

Monmouth took six direct hits 
by my own count, standing help- 
less in the whaleboat. The ship 
was hurt. Our lights failed and 
then went on again as the secon- 
dary circuits cut in. The secon- 
daries failed and our own whale- 
boat batteries lit the little cabin 
as I cut in the sealer switches. 
Outside in the passageways, there 
was no power at all, at least in 
our deep)-laid section of the keel- 
son, but from far away I could 
hear the rattle of the loud-hailers, 
and what they snapped out sharp- 
ly was: 

“All auxiliaries abandon ship! 
All auxiliaries abandon ship!” 

And that was the beginning of 
long hours of death-in-life for the 
four of us. 

We hugged the bottom, squat- 
ted there and waited. 

Crippled Monmouth was still 



SLAVE SHIP' 



113 



fighting. We could hear the dis- 
tant explosions; but there wasn’t 
anything we could do about it. 
Communication was impossible; 
the deeps were shuddering with 
explosions enough to drown out 
any call. To fight was out .of the 
question: Our whaleboat had no 
armament, for the space for the 
missile rackets and projectile 
tubes had been preempted by the 
animal pens. 

We squatted and waited. 

There came a time when the 
noise of combat slacked off and 
seemed more distant. I cut out 
the ruptured “eardrums” of our 
sound-ranging gear and tried to 
take a fix. There was still fighting, 
but it was drifting south of us and 
east. 

Nina said over my shoulder, 
watching the indicator needles: 
“They’re running for it. The Cao- 
dais are chasing them.” 

It seemed that way, but what- 
ever Monmouth was up to, we 
had still only one choice — to wait. 
If we were spotted by any Cao- 
dai, even a corvette, we were 
done; but if we stayed dead and 
silent on the ocean floor, we had a 
prayer of a hope. We would be 
spotted, no doubt about it, but 
spotted as a hulk of metal, noth- 
ing more. 

And the floor of the Indian 
Ocean just about there was rich 
in metal hulks. 

114 



TTARD AS it was on us, it was 
even harder on the animals. 
Josie was anxiously asking what 
was goiqg on, the puppies were al- 
ternately demanding food and 
whining for their box, the seals 
in their pens were barking wor- 
riedly. The process of learning 
had gone both ways. While we 
were picking up Dog and Seal, 
they were picking up Human In- 
tonations. They could tell we 
were upset and there is nothing 
in the world more likely to upset 
an animal that that knowledge. 

“Quiet, quiet,” pleaded Sem- 
yon in English and Dog and Seal. 
“You will drive me insane, you 
beasts.” He pushed the puppies to 
the floor and called Josie to at- 
tend to them. “Dog,” he said, but 
not to the animals; he was glow- 
ering at Winnington, silent against 
the hull of the whaleboat. 

“Leave him alone,” I said. 
Semyon switched his glower to 
me. “Leave him alone, it is? But 
did he leave us alone? He sent us 
to the bottom, Logan! Filthy 
patchifist, he fired the guns!” 
Winnington asked morosely: 
“From here?” 

“Hah,” said Semyon. “No, not 
you, but your brother patchifist, 
whoever he was. For peace you 
did it? Pig, how would it be for 
peace to make war?” 

“For ultimate peace!” Winning- 
ton flared. “You think we like kill- 
ing people, we peacemen? You’re 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



f 



an idiot if you think that peace 
means sitting quiet and taking 
punishment.” He was flushed and 
excited, taking a queer pleasure 
in the fact that we were all of us 
near death. “That is not pacifism, 
that’s stupidity! We must tight 
for peace, we must destroy the en- 
emy. Kill everybody who might 
kill us — then, only then, we’ll 
have peace!” 

We let him rant himself out 
while, very cautiously, we rocked 
the whaleboat free of the mud 
and crept quietly to the thermo- 
plane. We were no longer getting 
sounds of battle in the audic ap- 
paratus. Either the battle was 
over or out of range — or it was 
perhaps fairly close, but masked 
by the interface between the bot- 
tom water and the warmer waters 
above. 

The thermographs showed us 
when we breached the interface. 
I cut the drive, cut the ventilator 
switches, cut every motor that 
could give out a sound, and we 
listened as hard as we could. The 
little torp began instantly to set- 
tle, but we had plenty of water 
under us and the important thing 
was to be all ears, no sound, until 
we found out what was going on 
around us. 

A S THE whaleboat lost forward 
speed the diving vanes 
ceased to bear us up and we slid 
downward, closer to the thermo- 



plane we had just crossed. The 
autopilot began frantically manu- 
facturing course corrections. It 
flipped the diving vanes and the 
rudders like a panicked barnyard 
hen, and when that produced no 
effect, it began to beep complain- 
ingly. I snapped its cut-off switch 
and it was silent again, and we 
listened. 

Nothing. 

Nina said: “Do you think we 
ought to try the sonars?” 

I shook my head and started 
the motors as we sank under the 
thermoplane again. “No sense 
looking for trouble. If somebody’s 
playing possum close by, they’ll 
hear us on their audic, all right 
— but if we ping them, they 
won’t even have to be close by.” 
I locked in the autopilot. “Now 
what?” I asked. 

We had a long debate over 
what to do next. But it could only 
be decided one way. There was 
a Caodai installation on Mada- 
gascar, little more than three hun- 
dred miles away. Our mission was 
to survey it; if necessary, to at- 
tempt to destroy it. We would 
carry out our mission. 

Surprisingly, even Winnington 
agreed. “Very patriotic,” he 
sneered. “But I’ll go along. The 
sooner we wipe out those rats, the 
sooner the Peace Party can rule 
America.” 

“Very patriotic,” Semyon 
agreed moodily. “Also quite wise. 



SLAVE SHIP 



115 



I think. Because — am I wrong, 
Logan? — we do not really have 
a choice; we are ten thousand 
miles from home. And this little 
boat they give us, its range is not 
more than a thousand.” 

Madagascar was only three 
hundred miles away — but the 
island was a thousand miles long. 
It was touch-and-go whether we 
would make it. 

Semyon swore gloomily, coax- 
ing the power reserves along. We 
crept on the bottom, taking our 
position from sonar soundings and 
one daring midnight surfacing for 
a star fix. We made it 

We hovered in a muddy little 



estuary while Semyon talked 
lengthily to one of the seals. Then 
we bribed the seal into the aft 
ejection tube. It wasn’t necessary 
to blast him out with compressed 
air; he could swim free. He pilot- 
fished us up the little river as far 
as we dared go in the whaleboat, 
coming back to report and going 
forth to scout again. It was tedi- 
ous but reasonably safe. 

SENT Semyon and Josie 
out to scout; it was night 
and we were in a little cove, hid- 
den by tangled growth. They 
were gone forever, and came back 
covered with mud. 



116

“Is a terrible place, Logan,” 
Semyon groaned. “I thought we 
would be captured many times. 
But — it is there.” 

“Target Gamma?” 

“One presumes so.” He sighed. 
“There is a small town on this 
bank of the river. Perhaps two 
miles past it is a ring of labor 
camps. And in the center of the 
ring, something which is guarded. 
I did not myself see it, you under- 
stand, but Josie says it smells 
secret.” 

It was nearly dawn. Semyon 
was worn out, but Josie was as 
frisky as a puppy. She tended 
her brood while we were talking 



and demanded to be included in 
the party when we were through. 

We left Semyon to watch over 
Winnington and the other ani- 
mals. Nina, Josie and I made up 
the party that proposed to knock 
out the Caodai’s secret-weapon 
base. 

A girl, a dog and me. Struggling 
into her Madagascan coolie out- 
fit — slacks, sweater, floppy hat 
— Nina saw my expression and 
laughed. “Cheer up, Moeller,” she 
said. “There’s only about five mil- 
lion Caodais on the island. Not 
bad odds.” 

I found myself grinning back 
at her. It was a queer thing — I 
couldn’t help thinking about it, 
even with the approaching raid 
on my mind. Nina was an easy 
girl to get along with. It had been 
a long time since I had paid much 
attention to other girls. Why was 
it that now, with Elsie, compara- 
tively speaking, almost within 
reach, I was suddenly noticing 
how sweet and — and charming, 
I had to confess it, another girl 
was? 

It wasn’t a line of speculation 
I really wanted to follow to its 
end. I was glad when we slipped 
out of the upper hatch and 
climbed ashore to get started. 

ii \ LTE-LA, ALTE-LA," grum- 
bled the man in the yellow 
robe. “Vous etes bien pressee?” 

“Idiot,” Nina muttered to me

in English. “I told you to take it 
easy.” She smiled appealingly at 
the priest and spoke to him in 
rapid-fire French. I could make 
out only part of it: We were 
freshly arrived from Tananarive 
and looking for work; could he 
direct us to a rooming house? 

The Caodai shook his head. 
Without much interest, he 
yawned and stretched and asked 
to see our passports. That pre- 
sented a problem, because Nina 
didn’t have one. Semyon and I 
had been issued the best set of 
forged credentials Naval Intelli- 
gence could cook up, but no one 
had planned for Nina to be along. 
However, Nina’s French could get 
by and mine couldn’t, so we were 
in trouble either way; we had de- 
cided to pass as man and wife 
and hope that one passport would 
do for both. 

Nina kept up a clamor of ques- 
tions and comments while the 
priest was looking over the yel- 
low card that identified me as an 
agricultural worker of French ori- 
gin. There were plenty of them 
on Madagascar, hangovers from 
the colonial days and the over- 
throw that followed. The priest 
had evidently been up all night 
and real'.y just wanted to collect 
a toll for crossing the footbridge. 

He tossed the document back 
at me and growled: “Foutez le 
camp, touse les deux.” We paid 
him and moved along. 

118 



As soon as we were across the 
bridge into the town itself, Nina 
turned on me. “Moeller,” she 
snapped, “if you can’t relax, we’ll 
never get through. Walk slowly! 
You’ve supposedly been walking 
a long way and you’re tired. Hop 
like a grasshopper and you’ll at- 
tract attention.” 

T transferred the cord tied to 
Josie’s collar to my other 
hand. “Sure,” I said. ‘What do we 
do, amble casually right through 
the town?” 

‘What else?” It was early 
morning, but already the streets 
were crowded. Most of the people 
moving about the narrow streets 
were Arab-African mixtures of 
one hue or another, but there was 
an admixture of Orientals and a 
handful of Europeans. 

More than half of the Orientals 
wore the yellow robes, blouse or 
shorts of the Caodais. But they 
were not alone; several priests we 
passed were obviously nearly 
pure African. Caodaism, like the 
Mohammedans before them, 
practiced a rigid sort of tolerance; 
there was no distinction in skin 
color or creed for them — if the 
man whose skin was in question 
was willing to embrace the 
Caodai revelations and, if called 
up, join the Caodai armed forces. 

And hundreds of millions 
throughout the Asian and African 
world had been more than willing. 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



f The streets were not only nar- 
*^row; they wound like wormholes 
in an apple. I had to consult 
- Josie’s superior sense of direction 
— bending and talking to her 
under pretense of loosening her 
collar — to keep us heading 
straight through the town. She 
was almost the only leashed dog 
in sight and therefore attracted 
a little more attention than I 
liked; the Madagascan custom 
appeared to be to let dogs roam 
the streets, as unhampered and as 
privileged as a Benares bull. 

Everyone, it appeared, spoke 
French. I remembered that the 
Caodais themselves had come 
from a section of the Indonesian 
peninsula once under French rule, 
and of course Madagascar had 
been French for nearly a century. 

' All the same, it seemed odd to 
hear brown, black, tan and yellow 
faces conversing in the language 
I associated with bombed-out 
cities and finishing schools. 

44QOFTLY,” SAID Nina. “Keep 
your eyes on your lunch.” 
We were sitting beside the road 
as a company of Caodai infantry 
swung past. There was a sort of 
clearing in the vegetation, on the 
outskirts of the little town we had 
crossed; there were Oriental ven- 
dors of foods and we were not the 
only ones who had paused there 
for a bite to eat. The Caodai sol- 
diers paid no attention to any of 



us, being disciplined, eyes-front 
troops. 

They passed. Nina left me for 
a moment with the dog and 
talked briefly to one of the ven- 
dors. She came back with a hand- 
ful of dried dates and two Coca- 
Colas and said: 

“Security troops, I think. There 
are slave labor camps ahead. 
Does Josie recognize this road?” 

I spoke to the dog; she growled 
back dubiously. “It smelled alto- 
gether different,” I translated to 
for Nina, “but she thinks it’s the 
same place. It has something to 
do with daytime smells and night- 
time smells.” 

Nina nodded. “It checks. Labor 
camps beyond the bend in the 
road, something big on the other 
side of them. According to the 
Coke man, there’s nothing to stop 
us going right along the road — 
all the Caodai installations are off 
to one side, on the bank of the 
river.” 

It was high noon, or nearly, and 
most of the other pedestrians 
were disappearing down side 
roads and into shops and cafes. 
Nina and I conferred briefly and 
followed their example. We 
struck out boldly down one of the 
little dirt paths toward the river, 
looking for a place to use as a 
base of operations. No one 
stopped us; no one paid any at- 
tention. I was expecting Caodai 
infantrymen to pounce out at us 



SLAVE SHIP

from behind every tree. 

I must have shown it, because 
Nina snapped: “I told you, Logan, 
relax. Nobody’s going to bother 
us.” 

She was right. After all, we 
were not a platoon of commando- 
ing Marines, anti-flash painted, 
tommygun-carrying, camouflage- 
helmeted. We were only a man 
and a woman and a dog; if I had 
seen a party like ours anywhere 
in the United States, I would 
scarcely have noticed it. 

Except — 

Come to think of it, I would 
have noticed such a party. I said 
curiously to Nina: “See anything 
unusual about these people? Ci- 
vilians! Outside of the Caodai 
priests and the troops that 
marched by in the road — how 
many have you seen in uniform?” 
She nodded thoughtfully. “A 
pMuliar way to fight a war, I 
guess. You’d think they’d be as 
deep in this thing as we are, 
wouldn’t you? Now look,” she 
said, dismissing it, “how about hol- 
ing up here and sending Josie in 
for a look?” 

TT WAS a good enough place — 
on the shore of the river, 
where we might appear to be rest- 
ing and enjo5ung the view if any- 
one should come along. I talked 
to Josie long enough to make 
sure she imderstood. 

Josie was a patient dog, but she 



had very little comprehension of 
just what we humans were about, 
there on the banks of the Mada- 
gascan creek. She wasn’t a stray 
mutt and she didn’t want to act 
like one; she complained that she 
had been told many times that it 
was impolite and inexcusable to 
eat out of garbage piles or cans — 
and yet that was what we were 
asking her to do now, to justify 
her wanderings. She was a well- 
brought-up dog who had been 
taught to stay close to her home 
and master and — 

I finally snarled loud enough to 
convince her; she rolled over on 
her back and I had to pat her 
stomach to let her know we were 
still friends. With the canine 
equivalent of a shrug, she started 
out. 

Hours passed and she didn’t 
come back. 

“Dogs have no sense of time,” 
I explained to Nina, possibly for 
the hundredth time. 

She said reluctantly: “I know. 
I’m sorry if I’m pestering you. 
But I’m getting worried.” 

We had something to worry 
about, I agreed — but I didn’t 
agree out loud. I was the junior 
member of our expedition, and 
though we had never articulated 
a command relationship, I was 
perfectly willing to treat Nina’s 
“suggestions” as orders. Spying 
was her line of work, not mine. 

But it was dark and we were 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in enemy territory and a good bet 
to be shot out of hand in case 
someone asked us questions. Our 
scout was overdue reporting back 
and Nina was getting worried. 
And without any fuss, our relative 
positions changed. We were no 
longer commander and jaygee; 
we were worried woman and — 
however falsely — reassuring man. 
I liked it much better that way. 

“Stay here. I’ll take a look 
around,” said the man to the 
woman. 

“The devil you will,” said the 
commander to the jaygee. “Use 
your fat head for something, 
Logan. How do you expect to find 
the dog — whistle all the way 
from here to the Caodai installa- 
tion?” 

I said reasonably: “Of course 
not. I just want to take a look 
around — ” 

“No.” 

So that was that — for the 
time being. 

B ut time passed and Josie 
stayed away; and what it 
came down to in the long run was 
the choice of which of us should 
go looking. And I won, if you can 
call it that. 

Madagascar was an unfriendly 
place, after dark of a night. I 
could hear vehicles on the paved 
road, but I stayed off it. I could 
hear voices, now and again, 
around the houses that fronted on 



the river, but I gave them a wide 
berth. I felt uncomfortably like 
a fawn somehow forced to slink 
through Central Park from end 
to end, avoiding the worrisome 
human smell all about. Only I 
was more purposeful than a fawn, 
of course; closer perhaps to a 
beast of prey — a fox, say, trying 
to raid a henhouse. 

And unaware (or all too fright- 
eningly aware) that the henhouse 
was guarded by mastiffs. 

I wasn’t so much looking for 
the dog as trying to accomplish 
the dog’s job. If Josie turned up 
where Nina waited in the clear- 
ing, good; Nina would hold her 
there until I returned. But if not, 
we couldn’t stay there forever. It 
would then be my spied-out infor- 
mation we would go back to the 
whaleboat with, not Josie’s. All I 
wanted was one clear look at the 
secret installation up ahead. 
Much more than that I couldn’t 
hope for, but from whatever I 
could find out then, we could 
plan. 

There were lights ahead. I was 
on the brink of the woods, facing 
a plowed-up open strip that sur- 
rounded a lighted, barbed-wire- 
enclosed compound — the prison 
camps, I supposed. There were 
Caodai guards emplaced about 
the fence, but not so close to me 
that I had to worry about them. 
Their attention would certainly 
be inward, toward the prisoners. 



SLAVE SHIP 



121 



But beyond the barbed wire, per- 
haps a quarter of a mile, there 
were two bright-lit yellow brick 
towers. 

So far, so good. I skirted the 
edge of the plowed ground and 
headed for the lighted towers. 

I was pretty lucky. I must have 
gone a hundred yards before they 
caught me. 

XVI 

WTl^STERN SWINE!” hissed 

” the Caodai. “Stay and 
brood on your crimes. Western 
swine!” 

It didn’t seem fair for him to 
call me that; he was as white as 
I. Fair-haired and chunky, he 
might have been of Dutch ances- 
try, but the Caodais didn’t care 
about that. 

He threw me into a cell and 
marched his detail away. I was 
in a yellow-walled room under- 
neath the twin-towered building 
I had seen alight. 

Logan, old boy, I told myself, 
you’ve had it. 

Consider this fact: 

I was out of uniform in Caodai 
territory — that made me a spy. 
It was well known what the Cao- 
dai did to spies. 

There was only one bright 
spot: 

Nina and Semyon were still 
free. 

They knew I had been cap- 
122 



tured, so they would be careful. 
Would being careful be enough, 
though? I didn’t know, but, on 
thinking it over, I decided it 
wouldn’t, because there simply 
was no precaution they could 
take that would counterbalance 
their having to get inside the 
temple I was in. 

I couldn’t forget what the 
briefing officer had told us all, 
back on Monmouth: This expedi- 
tion had to work, because the 
Caodais could not continue to be 
in possession of the secret of the 
Glotch. 

“Western swine!” 

My Dutch friend was at the 
door. He wasn’t alone. A very 
dark Caodai, wearing a shoulder 
patch that looked like a rook in 
chess, brought in a case full of 
shiny things. Half a dozen other 
Caodais followed. Two of them 
grabbed me. 

The dark one took a hypoder- 
mic needle out of the case. 

“Wait a minute!” I said sharply. 
“You can’t do this to me! I claim 
the protection of international 
law. You can execute me, but — 
ow!” He was mighty clumsy with 
that needle. 

It tingled for a second and then 
my whole upper arm and shoul- 
der began to feel cold. Well, I 
knew what was coming next. 
Subtle Oriental poisons, for a 
start. Then brainwashing. Tor- 
ture. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I said to myself: Good-by, 

Elsie. I was beginning to feel cold 
all over; the fair-skinned Caodai 
was standing over me, but he 
seemed far away. 

He took out a pad of paper. 
“Your name?” he demanded. 
Name, rank and serial number. 
That was all, I reminded myself. 

I gave them to him as briskly and 
finally as I could: “Moeller, 
Logan, lieutenant junior grade, 
X-SaT-32880515.” 

“How did you get here?” 

I stiffened; it was beginning. 
But he would never find out 
about Monmouth and the whale- 
boat from me. “I refuse to an- 
swer,” I said distinctly. 

I T TOOK an effort. The yellow 
walls were swirling around me 
now. I no longer felt cold; I 
hardly felt anything at all. I could 
barely hear the Dutch Caodai 
saying: “Where are your com- 
panions?” 

Which one? Semyon was in 
the whaleboat, I supposed, but 
Nina — 

I got a grip on myself. “No 
answer,” I said. 

I stared at him Wearily, won- 
dering what made a man like him 
turn renegade. Of course, when 
the Caodais overran the former 
Dutch colonies in the Indies, they 
had picked up everyone who 
would join them. In that respect, 
the Caodais were a perfect de- 



mocracy. But still and all, a white 
renegade in Caodai uniform was 
hard to take. 

“Atheistic Western swine!” 
hissed the Caodai. “Don’t dare 
call me a renegade!” 

Fantastic, I thought to myself 
drowsily. Ifs almost as if I were 
speaking my thoughts aloud. 

I woke up with a jump. I had 
a sour, tinny taste in my mouth 
and an unbelievable headache. 

Nina Willette was shaking me. 
“You cracked! Moeller, listen to 
me.” 

I blinked blearily at her. She 
said, with pity and reproach: 
“They worked you over, didn’t 
they, Logan? But you shouldn t 
have cracked.” 

“Hey,” I protested, “hold it!” I 
sat up and tried to set her 
straight. “I gave them my name 
and rank and serial number. 
That’s all. I didn’t crack!” 

“No?” She looked at me and 
the pity was subtracted from her 
gaze, leaving only the reproach. 
“Then how did they know where 
I was?” 

“Be reasonable, Nina. They 
must have — ” 

“How did they know my 
name?” 

“Good God!” I whispered. 
“That needle. They must have 
shot me full of scopolamine.” 

“Exactly, atheistic Western 
swine,” said the blond Caodai, 
opening the door. “Exactly.”

They were not gentle with us, 
but I hardly noticed. Truth 
serum! The psychic censors 
numbed, the questions answered 
— I must have spilled my guts 
for fair. 

It was no comfort to reassure 
myself that it was not my fault, 
because it was a lie. It was my 
fault — my fault for allowing 
myself to be captured, my fault 
for being there in the first place. 

We were led out of the cell, 
Nina Willette and I, and up into 
the main workings of the twin- 
towered temple. Target Gamma! 

If only we had some way of 
getting back to America with 
what we were seeing now! 

A ND YET, coming out of my 
fog of self-reproach, looking 
about me against the faint, almost 
vanished chance that I might 
some day be able to get back and 
report, what would I have to say? 

I could say: “We went through 
a long yellow corridor full of Cao- 
dais.” 

I could say: “They looked at 
us as though we were lepers.” 

But I couldn’t say that I had 
learned the secret of the weapon 
called the Glotch, because there 
was no sign of anything like that 
anywhere around. 

An arsenal? I had thought we 
might be headed for something 
like that, but this didn’t look like 
an arsenal. It looked more like a 

124 



hospital, or perhaps a medical 
laboratory, than anjrthing else I 
had ever encountered, and that 
wasn’t really a matter of looks 
but of smell, the faint under-layer 
of ether and iodoform you find in 
medical places. There were no 
whirring machines or hidden in- 
dustrial plants, only the whisper- 
ing air and medicinal odor and 
white-and-pastel look, in the little 
rooms we caught glimpses of. 

And for this we had sacrificed 
Monmouth. 

We reached a high-ceiling room 
where an old Caodai in a scarlet 
cloak stood frozen beside a bright 
globe. 

“Votre saint ete,” said the 
blond-haired Caodai, “les ameri- 
cains.” 

Nina stiffened beside me. “The 
pope,” she whispered, unbeliev- 
ing. 

It took me a moment to under- 
stand what she meant. Not the 
pontiff of Rome, no, but the su- 
preme chief of the Caodais, who 
wore the same title. The old Cao- 
dai by the globe of the world was 
Nguyen Yat Hugo himself! 

Remember what I had seen of 
old Nguyen: latrine posters, 
showing him luring helpless U.N. 
soldiery into haunts of bawdy 
vice, his yellow face wicked and 
fierce, his long fingers clawed like 
a killer cat’s. 

But he was only a man. 

If he was evil, it did not show 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




SLAVE SHIP 



125 



in his face. He stood gravely 
watching us as we approached. 
He was tall for an Indo-Chinese, 
old but not senile, his robes curi- 
ous but not ridiculous. I remem- 
bered the Caodais in their stock- 
ade north of Project Mako and 
their fantastic paper figurines of 
this man. It was hard not to think 
of him as a figure of fun (Mardi 
Gras masks and Jacks-in-the- 
box), but in his presence it wasn’t 
hard at all. 

“You slime!” 

Not evil but anger. He spoke to 
us and he was raging. Nina, be- 
side me, made a little choking 
sound. 

He lashed into us verbally, 
cut us to ribbons. We were 
slime, wretches, unfit to live. We 
stood there and listened. What 
else could we do? 

TTE FINALLY rounded a pe- 
riod and stopped, his face 
as emotionless as before. He said 
something short and foreign to 
one of the Caodai priests — a 
middle-aged woman who looked 
like my mother’s laundress — 
and we all waited while the priest 
left and then returned. 

She brought another woman 
with her, a slight brown-haired 
womani in faded khaki. I stared 
at her curiously as she blinked in 
the light. It crossed my mind that 
she was no Caodai. She had the 
look of an American, though her 



dress might have been Caodai as 
much as anything else. She looked 
out of place here. I watched her, 
waiting for something to happen 
that would explain why she was 
here. 

By and by, I noticed that the 
Caodais were very intently watch- 
ing me. 

And then I realized who the 
girl was. 

Strange that I should see my 
long-lost wife and not at once rec- 
ognize her? 

I suppose so, but I wasn’t the 
only one that had to do a double- 
take. Elsie herself didn’t quiver a 
muscle until I suddenly yelled 
her name. 

There was a dizzy, slippery, 
sliding moment when everything 
around me crashed into new ar- 
rangements and meanings and I 
stood still, like an idiot, saying 
her name and staring. And then 
I was running toward her and she 
toward me. 

We shook hands. 

It was more that than a lovers’ 
hug — we stopped inches apart 
and I reached out my hands 
toward hers. 

Perhaps the strain would have 
passed and we would have been 
in each other’s arms, but the Gab- 
dai chief stopped us. 

“Your wife,” he said in a clear, 
savage voice. “Enjoy her for this 
moment, my lieutenant. She may 
not live to the next.” 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I had dropped Elsie’s hands, 
spun around and was halfway to 
him, in a single reflex, before the 
Caodai officers leaped between 
me and Nguyen, and their 
weapons were in their hands. 

I said: “What the devil are you 
up to?” 

“Up to?” he repeated bitterly. 
“No, Lieutenant, I want to know 
what you are up to. Perhaps we 
could have pieced out our infor- 
mation from your subconscious, 
where we found your wife’s name 
and the story of your interesting 
voyage here. But it would have 
taken time, and I do not have 
time.” 

I TOOK A deep breath and the 
officers slowly bolstered their 
guns. Nina was on one side of me 
and Elsie on the other. 

I said: “What do yoii want?” 
“Information! Truthful an- 
swers, Lieutenant — for which I 
will pay — with your life and 
your wife’s.” 

I glanced at Elsie and Nina. 
Both of them were watching me, 
waiting for me to do something, 
waiting for my brilliant solution 
to an intolerable predicament. 
But there wasn’t any solution in 
me. 

I looked around at the Caodai 
officers, at the implacable face of 
Nguyen Yat Hugo. The thing was 
bitterly ironic: The Caodai was 
demanding information from me. 



information that could hardly be 
of any real importance to the 
Caodai cause (for what did I have 
to say, past the minutiae of our 
voyage?), but which I knew I 
would die to keep from him. 

If our positions had changed — 
if it were I who had the secret 
of what they called the Glotch 
and he who had to learn it to live 

— then it might have made sense, 
both his insistence to learn and 
my willingness to die, and have 
Nina and Elsie die, rather than 
tell. 

It didn’t make sense. It was an 
outrageous perversion of human 
values for the three of us to suffer 
for the sake of concealing so little. 

But that, as they say, was the 
way the little old ball bounced. I 
cleared my throat once and said 
to Nguyen Yat Hugo: 

“Go to hell!” 

Well, the heavens didn’t fall on 
us just then, though I had thought 
they might. But I underestimated 
Nguyen. 

All that happened was that he 
gave quick orders and the three 
of us were marched out — sepa- 
rately. And there I was in the 
yellow-walled room again. 

I knew what it was, of course 

— the softening up that makes 
the ultimate tearing apart so 
much easier. Leave the Ameri- 
cans alone, Nguyen had said to 
his officers; put them away and 
let them worry for a while; let 



SLAVE SHIP 



127 



them scare themselves to death 
by brooding on what’s going to 
happen to them. 

But I didn’t think it was going 
to work. 

I sat there, staring at the yel- 
low walls and wondering which 
of the footsteps in the corridor 
outside was going to be my tor- 
turer’s, and I coded up all the 
factors and played them through 
the computer inside my skull. 

Too bad that I had spilled 
Elsie’s name and location in my 
drugged state so that Nguyen 
could have her flown here to tor- 
ture me with. Too bad that Nina 
had been caught the same way. 
Too bad that no one could get 
word of what had happened to us 
to Semyon, back in the whale- 
boat. 

Too bad. All of it too bad. 

But those losses were already 
raked in and there was no point 
in wishing the little steel ball had 
dropped in a different slot. 

¥T WOULD have been better, 
I concluded, if I were in this 
all by myself, but since I wasn’t, 
I would have to do the best I 
could with the circumstances I 
had to work with. Nguyen would 
roast in his Caodai hell before I 
would tell him a single syllable of 
what he wanted to know. Not be- 
cause it mattered what I told him 
(for I knew nothing, of course), 
nor because I was a hero (for I 



knew from the trembling of my 
arms and legs I was not), but 
because that was the way the 
game was played. 

And I wasn’t going to get out 
alive, anyhow. 

That was the important thing 
to remember: I was going to die. 
No matter what Nguyen said, 1 
was a spy, trapped in a spy’s role, 
and the best I could hope for was 
a quick firing squad. 

Once I had thought of all of the 
possibilities, the computer that 
was my brain quickly rapped out 
my solution; it wasn’t hard to see. 
Back at M.I.T., when I had 
learned computer operation and 
the mathematics that went with 
it, we had had a course in what 
they call Theory of Games. It 
hadn’t kept me from dropping 
all of my loose change in each of 
the weekly poker nights, but it 
probably prolonged the process. 

Roughly, it came to this: When 
things go well, play to win as 
much as you can; when things go 
poorly, play to lose as little. 

This was no spot for maximiz- 
ing gains. There was no prospect 
of any gain worth having. It was 
a spot for minimizing losses. I 
couldn’t hope to get us all freely 
and successfully away. But I 
could hope that, perhaps, I would 
be the only one to die. If I did, 
Nina would have to stand by her- 
self — but was she any better off 
with me alive? And Elsie, on the 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



other hand, was nothing to 
Nguyen. She had no information; 
she had not been trapped in es- 
pionage. He might conceivably 
kill her out of pique — but not 
probably. 

So the thing for me to do was 
to make the guards kill me right 
away. 

On the principle of minimiza- 
tion of losses, I couldn’t even try 
to grab a gun and shoot Nguyen. 
That was too risky — not to me, 
but to Elsie and Nina in case I 
was successful. What I had to 
have was a nice, quiet, futile at- 
tack on a humble, trigger-happy 
guard. End of Lieutenant Logan 
Moeller. As minimal a loss as 
anyone could imagine. 

I made my plans and then I 
waited. 

T hey came for me — I don’t 

know after how long a time. 

It was important that I do 
nothing premature. I didn’t make 
the mistake of attacking them as 
soon as they poked their noses in 
the door — they might have just 
clobbered me with their fists and 
tied me to make sure I didn’t try 
it again. I went along with them. 

Though I know the Dutch Cao- 
dai addressed me in English, I 
paid no attention to their actions 
or manner. Down the corridor, 
into the elevator, out into the 
great hall. At the entrance to the 
hall, I decided, I would grab for 



a gun, point it at the handiest 
figure in a yellow robe and wait 
for the bullets. 

We got to the entrance and the 
moment the door opened, I made 
my move. I got the gun — sur- 
prisingly, with no difficulty. I had 
thought that would be the hard 
part, but the guard’s grip was in- 
credibly lax. I had it and I leaped 
through the door and drew a bead 
on the female priest, the closest 
to me, standing morosely by the 
door. I could feel my shoulder- 
blades drawing close to each 
other, waiting for the bullets to 
strike. 

Only — 

No bullets. 

I gaped around. There were the 
Caodai officers and there was 
Nguyen. And there, smoking a 
cigarette, swinging a gun in his 
free hand... 

“Splendidly done, Logan!” said 
Semyon earnestly, throwing away 
the cigarette. “A brilliant maneu- 
ver. I should have known I would 
not be necessary. Is too bad you 
cannot capture these Orientals 
and deliver them to justice, is it 
not? But, you see, I have done so 
already.” 

XVIII 

I T TOOK a while for it to sink 
in and I stood gaping in the 
meantime. 

Semyon shrugged modestly. “A 



SLAVE SHIP 



129 



heroic feat, you say?” I hadn’t 
said anything of the sort. “Oh, 
perhaps. But the credit should 
not merely be my own, Logan. 
Equally brave were the crew. We 
slipped up this filthy small river, 
every man at his post, searching 
out the Oriental target — ” 

I goggled. “What — ” 

“The crew,” he said emphati- 
cally, “is brave also. Every man 
of them. No, no, Logan, I under- 
stand that you think of me as 
your rescuer, but without the six 
men in our crew out there in the 
river, manning the guns that will 
blow the roof off this very yellow 
brick building, what would my 
small gun accomplish?” 

I caught on. I was surprised 
that Nguyen and his court didn’t 
catch on, too, he made it so easy. 
But Semyon hurried on: “And we 
must not keep them waiting, 
Logan. If I do not appear outside 
within — ” he consulted his watch 
— “eleven minutes, that is the 
end of all of us. Come, old man.” 
He jerked his pistol at Nguyen. 
“Let us go to surrender.” 

Nguyen corrected coldly. “I 
agreed to talk. I do not sur- 
render.” 

“As you wish it, old man. But 
come outside now, if you please. 
Perhaps my crew’s watches are 
not accurate.” 

Well, we all went — Semyon 
and the pope and Nina and Elsie, 
fresh from their own cells and as

astonished as I, and all. And then 
I was even more astonished, be- 
cause there at the foot of the 
grass that went down to the little 
river rocked the whaleboat, look- 
ing tiny and ridiculous in the 
African sun; and as we came out, 
the muzzles of the deck guns, 
capable of launching high explo- 
sive shells that would blow us all 
to free ions in the air, swiveled 
to cover us. 

I looked at them incredulously. 
Who were the gunners? And then 
I thought I understood. I whis- 
pered to Semyon: “Winnington?” 
“Tied up,” he whispered back. 
“Hush.” Out loud, he said: 
“What is it to be, old man? Do we 
all die here and now? Or do we 
discover a solution that permits 
us all to go on living?” 

Nguyen, staring sourly at the 
little whaleboat, said: “There is 
none. You cannot go free. But it 
was clever of you. Lieutenant, to 
have lied under our drug.” 

I said helpfully: “Oh, I wasn’t.” 
“Enough! cried Semyon. “One 
thing at a time, if you please.” 
He glared at me and said to the 
Caodai: “These are our terms. 
First, you give us safe-conduct out 
of the belligerent zone. Second, 
you come with us as a hostage. 
Third, you attempt no reprisals. 
Fourth — ” 

“Three will do,” said the Cao- 
dai. “No.” 

Semyon blinked at him. “No?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



N guyen again was the im- 
placable, ageless figure I had 
first seen. He contemptuously ig- 
nored Semyon’s gun, ignored the 
deck guns of the w^haleboat, 
stepped close to Semyon and 
looked him in the eye. He said: 
“You shall not escape. You would 
not get so far as the mouth of the 
I river.” 

‘ Semyon retorted: “We’ll blow 
you to bits.” 

“Do.” 

Semyon looked at me. 
“Logan?” he inquired weakly. 

I cleared my throat. “Will you 
give us a safe-conduct, at least?” 
“No.” 

“Will you — ” 

“Nothing, my lieutenant. If the 
Great Palace wishes my death at 
this time, I shall die; that is as 
the Great Palace wishes it.” 

I stared at him thoughtfully. 
He stared right back, not giving 
, an inch. It wasn’t bluff. Here was 
the pope of all the Caodais, the 
supreme ruler of half the Earth, 
the most deadly fighting man the 
i world had ever made. And here 
were we, a handful of unimpor- 
tant humans and a couple of dogs 
and seals, and he was willing to 
die rather than even give us his 
promise — which he could have 
broken without a moment’s pang 
— to let us go free. 

I shook my head silently. He 
never would have passed Game 
Theory at M.I.T., I thought, an- 



noyed. Everything was with him; 
this was a time for him to be 
maximizing his gains, stretching 
out to conquer the world as it 
reeled under the Glotch. 

I swallowed and stared harder. 
Maybe, the thought came from 
nowhere, maybe he might have 
passed the course, after all. 
Maybe it was not his technique 
that was wrong, but my estimate 
of the situation. 

I contemplated the thought in- 
credulously. Could it be, I asked 
myself, that things weren’t going 
as well as they seemed for old 
Nguyen? It was ridiculous. And 
yet, as he stood there, he was no 
voracious conqueror; he was a 
sober, fierce old man, hopeless of 
moving forward, but inflexibly 
unwilling to retreat. 

It didn’t make sense. 

I T WAS an impasse and we 
might have been there yet — 
if Semyon had ever been a Boy 
Scout. I don’t know what they 
taught them at the Suvorov Acad- 
emy, but I guarantee knot-tying 
was not in the curriculum, be- 
cause while we were staring at 
each other, there was an inter- 
ruption. 

And the name of the interrup- 
tion was Winnington. 

It was Nina who saw him. 
“Logan!” she gasped. “We’re in 
trouble!” The topside hatch of the 
whaleboat was open and Win- 



SLAVE SHIP 



131 



nington’s surly face was sticking 
out 

We were all armed, of course, 
with guns we’d taken from the 
resentful Caodais and perhaps, if 
we’d been quicker, we could have 
potted Winnington before he got 
out of the hatch. But he had the 
jump on us. He was manning the 
deck guns from the breech posi- 
tion and it was too late; we 
couldn’t shoot. If we had looked 
as through we were going to 
shoot, it would have been the last 
look on the faces of any of us. He 
cut out the switches to the remote 
fire-control stations below and 
stared at us, evidently deciding 
what to do. 

A small brown pointed nose 
poked out of the hatch behind 
him. Josie. She looked worried, 
even at that distance, and I knew 
why. Semyon had left her to run 
the remotes on the deck guns, as 
she had so painstakingly learned 
back in the monitor at Project 
Mako, but his instructions had 
not included what to do in the 
event that a human captive got 
free. Naturally Josie was per- 
plexed. 

But not so perplexed and wor- 
ried as I, because I knew what 
Winnington was likely to do. 
Peace? He’d do whatever came 
to hand for that ideal; he’d win 
peace even if he had to blow up 
the world to get it. 

He bent to the loud-hailer and 



his amplified bellow nearly 
bowled us over. “Get out of the 
way!” 

Semyon shouted furiously; 
“Turn that thing off! Get away 
from those guns, Winnington, I 
command you!” 

“Hah!” roared Winnington, but 
he did turn the loud-hailer off. “I 
said get out of the way! I see who 
you’ve got there. Either you move 
or you go with him!” 

And he put his thumbs on the 
gun-trips. 

Semyon cried: “Wait! Wait, 
Winnington! Let us not be hasty! 
There is much to lose.” But he 
seemed to have panicked; he was 
snapping his fingers erratically, 
babbling words that made little 
sense. 

Winnington shouted angrily: 
“No stalling, Timayazev. I’ll give 
you ten seconds to stand aside. 
Ten seconds, you hear me?” 
“Please,” begged Semyon, snap- 
ping his fingers frantically; I 
stared at him incredulously, won- 
dering how far he had been 
pushed to dissolve so completely 
in terror. “Please, Winnington, I 
beg of you, do not fire!” 

A ND THEN I wasn’t staring at 
Semyon at all, but at the 
deck of the whaleboat. Hesitantly, 
by fits and starts, looking bewil- 
deredly at Semyon, Josie moved 
up behind Winnington. It was 
absolutely impossible, I told my- 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



self, but she seemed to be follow- 
ing orders. But what orders? I 
glanced at Semyon. He was 
scarcely looking at the dog, only 
pleading with the pacifist and 
snapping his — 

Snapping bis fingers. 

I remembered the cricket and 
the “little one-word language.” 
And there, if you like, is a meas- 
ure of comparative intelligence, 
for it was clear that Josie had 
remembered it before me. She 
closed her eyes and took a nip 
out of Winnington. 

Reflexes are reflexes. Josie, 
yowling, was kicked yards away 
and into the water by Winning- 
ton’s foot, but by the time he got 
his eyes around front again, it 
was a little too late. Semyon had 
been waiting; his gun was up. He 
fired and Winnington dropped. 

“And now, old man,” Semyon 
said to the pope, perfectly calm, 
’Sve resume our little talk, cor- 
rect? I have saved your life from 
that patchifist; perhaps you will 
be more reasonable now?” 

But Nguyen blazed: “Tricks, 
Russian! You have tricked me, I 
see, but it is not important. If 
I must die, I die gladly, for I have 
no wish to outlive the Great Pal- 
ace. If the world cannot be Cao- 
dai, let me perish!” 

There it was again! Even Sem- 
yon frowned. 

Nguyen was roaring on: 
“Name your conditions! I refuse 



them all! Filth and slime, killers, 
vermin! You have us, but I spit 
on you!” 

It was my turn to argue with 
Nguyen. But I didn’t do it. There 
was a sudden queer flash, quick 
and gone. 

Elsie put her hand on my arm. 
“What — what — ” It had been 
like lightning, but there were no 
clouds; I couldn’t understand it. 

Semyon understood it, though. 
He understood it very well. He 
moaned something in Russian, his 
face gone suddenly sick. He 
nodded to me and said conversa- 
tionally: “The clouds again, you 
see, Logan. Climbing trees on the 
horizon.” That was silly, because 
I had just looked and there 
weren’t any clouds. 

There hadn’t been any. But 
now there was one. 

“Like Irkutsk once more,” said 
Semyon, and gestured with his 
gun to the horizon. I looked, in- 
credulous, as the mounting cloud 
leaped and spread, and then the 
concussion hit us from the distant 
nuclear blast. 

XIX 

TF7B NESTLED on the bottom, 

^ a mile off shore, and waited. 
Waited for what? Not for some 
miracle to put fuel in our tanks; 
there was no hope of that. Not for 
someone to rescue us; the U.N. 
would never come near Madagas- 



SLAVE SHIP 



133 



car and the Caodais would not 
rescue but kill. Not even for the 
world to come to an end. That 
had already begun. We just 
waited. 

Semyon was comforting the 
animals; Elsie and Nina were sit- 
ting inspecting each other in si- 
lence. 

We had taken a prisoner, 
old Nguyen himself, and he was 
bound where once we had bound 
the late pacifist Winnington. Too 
bad he was dead, I told myself — 
he would have been delighted 
with the way things were working 
out. Because his blind dream, the 
war to bring peace by destroying 



all warriors on Earth, was already 
started. 

Nguyen said heavily from his 
comer: “Incredible.” He was star- 
ing reflectively at Semyon and 
the dogs. “They are your animals; 
you use them as slaves. Some you 
kill and eat, do you not? The Cao- 
dai does not eat flesh; that seems 
horrible to us. And yet — they 
love you.” 

Semyon patted Josie. “We love 
them!” he said defiantly. 

Nguyen shrugged. “It is well 
known that you love everyone 
and everything. It accounts for 
the satellite bombings as easily 
as for your slaughterhouses.”

W “Shut up, old man!” said Sem- 
yon. 

He crooned to the dogs while 
' Elsie flared up. 

“Put a gag in his mouth. I'm 
sick of Caodai hypocrisy. The 
Western atheists do this and the 

I Western atheists do that, and we 
m older away in their prison 
camps while they pretend that 
the fault’s all ours. Gag him or 
I’ll shut him up myself!” 

I looked in some amazement at 
j my warrior bride. 

■ For I remembered Elsie. She 
was a quiet and biddable girl 
when we married — not counting 
her habit of volunteering, of 
course. I’d never heard her 
scream at anyone — at anyone 
at all, not even me. True, Nguyen 
was the arch-enemy and she must 
have had pitiful fantasies of a 
chance like this while she was in 
the concentration camp. But even 
so — 

Not the least of the problems 
of the Big Cold War, I thought, 
would come when the Elsies and 
the Myself s tried to get back to 
where we could recognize each 
other again. 

' Nina Merriam was collecting 
herself again. She was an Intelli- 
gence officer and she, too, had no 
doubt had ridiculous dreams of a 
chance like this. “Now then!” she 
said briskly to the pope of the 
, Caodai. “Tell me what you were 
doing here.” 

SLAVE SHIP 




135 



IJE LOOKED at her calmly. “I 
ask you to tell me,” she 
wheedled. “Please. There is no 
use to keep a secret, is there?” 
She offered him a cigarette and 
smiled, woman-to-man. 

“An admirable performance,” 
commented Nguyen. “I do not 
smoke, but your interrogation is 
splendid.” 

“Thank you. Why did you 
leave Cambodia for this lousy lit- 
tle island?” 

He shrugged. 

Nina smiled again. “Good. You 
stick to your principles. I don’t 
suppose any of us will last twenty- 
four more hours, but we might as 
well go on with it, just as if it 
mattered whether you gave us in- 
formation or I obtained it. So I 
shall continue to ask questions 
and you will answer only where 
it doesn’t matter. Correct?” 

Nguyen nodded wearily. 

Semyon cut in: “You could at 
least tell us what is happening, 
old man. There is no secret about 
that.” 

Nguyen closed his eyes. “The 
end of the world is happening. 
Your ship attacked us in our own 
waters. We retaliated. Your peo- 
ple retailiated against our retalia- 
tion — ” 

“The satellite bombs?” 

“You have seen one of them,” 
said Nguyen Yat Hugo. “You 
must realize that our bombs are 
falling, too.” 

136 



Nina whimpered: “But why? 
You must have known it was the 
end for all of us!” 

Semyon raged: “Couldn’t you 
wait, old man? Your weapon was 
too slow, was it? The burning and 
killing did not satisfy you, so you 
must unleash the satellite bombs.” 
Nguyen said hoarsely: “Our 
weapon? What weapon is that?” 
“I do not know your name for 
it,” Semyon retorted contemptu- 
ously. “We call it the Glotch; it 
is a burning fire that strikes the 
head and neck and — ” 

The stern, stiff old face of 
Nguyen was cracking. “No,” 
he cut in, shaking his head. 

It was incredible, but you 
couldn’t doubt the expression on 
his face. 

I stammered: “It — it isn’t 
your weapon?” 

“It is not,” said Nguyen with 
passion. “We Caodai are on our 
knees before it!” 

We stared at each other. 

If it wasn’t a Caodai weapon — 
and Elsie confirmed that it had 
struck them as hard as us — 
And if it wasn’t our own 
weapon, which it was not — 
Whose weapon was it? 

44rpoO LATE, too late!” whis- 
■*- pered Nguyen, looking 
through our periscopic sights. We 
had surfaced and the smoking 
coast of Madagascar was a mile 
or less away. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Maybe the damage is only 
local, I said. “Can you raise any- 
one on the radio, Nina?” 

She shook her head. “Every- 
body’s jamming.” 

“Fall-out negligible,” Semyon 
reported from the aft lookout 
ports. “There must have been an 
onshore wind. One shouldn’t swim 
too long in these waters, though.” 
I said to the pope of the Cao- 
dai: “If we find a spot on the 
coast where we can safely land, 
can you conduct us to a place 
where we can radio the U.N. 
forces?” 

He spread his hands, his face 
unemotional. “I can try.” 

“We haven’t any other choice, 
Logan,” Elsie reminded me. I no- 
ticed that her hand was in mine. 
“Even if we could refuel this boat, 
we could scarcely navigate it back 
across the Atlantic.” 

“Man your stations,” I ordered. 
“Nguyen, I assume you haven’t 
any hailing signal we could use 
for a safe-conduct? It would be a 
help, if a Caodai ship should spot 
us.” 

“There is none.” 

“Full speed south then,” I said. 
“As long as the fuel holds out.” 

It held out better than I had 
expected; we made nearly ten 
miles before the engines began to 
splutter. While we still had steer- 
age way, I spun the rudder wheel 
and we slanted in on a sandy 
beach. 

SLAVE SHIP 



There were concrete pillboxes 
and chevaux-de-frise, and God 
knows how many electronic and 
sonar alarms we triggered as we 
beached. But there apparently 
were very few Caodais at the fil- 
ter centers that day, after the 
bombs had fallen. Our only real 
danger — from that particular 
source, at least — was that some- 
one would notice we had landed, 
on a radar remote, and send over 
a nike to home in on us to save 
the trouble of investigating. 

We ran up from the beach, 
as far away as we could get before 
our breath gave out, in case a 
wandering patrol should happen 
by. 

“There is,” said the pope, “a 
command post somewhere about. 
I consecrated it myself two days 
ago.” 

We sent one of the monkeys 
up a tree, but she either couldn’t 
understand what we wanted or 
her short simian vision didn’t let 
her detect the building we had 
described. Semyon, cursing in 
Russian, tried climbing to see for 
himself. But we couldn’t get high 
enough to see, any of us. 

“It is this way,” said Nguyen 
strongly, and what could we do 
but follow his lead? 

And he led us right into a trap. 

T here were Coadais all 

over the place. They swarmed 
from the command post like ter- 

137 



mites from a hill; there was a 
rattle of small-arms fire, and rush- 
ing brown-skinned men in uni- 
forms, and it was all over before 
we could move. For a moment 
when they jumped us, I had old 
Nguyen in front of my gun and I 
don’t know why I didn’t pull the 
trigger. 

“Treacherous beast!” sobbed 
Semyon. “We trusted you and 
you betrayed us!” And I felt much 
the same. 

“No!” cried Nguyen, and he 
bellowed something at the Cao- 
dai soldiers. They gave him an 
argument. Apparently he wasn’t 
recognized, but they took us all 
to the command post and there 
was a long, complicated discus- 
sion in French too fast for my 
ears. Nina, following it as closely 
as she could, explained: 

“They think he’s an impostor 
and the fat one is all for shooting 
the lot of us. Somebody’s going to 
get a picture of the pope and com- 
pare.” 

They brought the picture — a 
ceremonial portrait draped in yel- 
low bunting, as remote a likeness 
to the real man in its own pretti- 
fying way as the caricatures in 
our latrines had been in theirs. 

But it convinced them. So all 
we had to do was arrange to use 
their radio, get in touch with the 
U.N. command in Washington, 
stop the war and clear up the 
mess. 

138 



We never got past Step One. 
Jamming — loud and furious, jam- 
ming by the Caodais and jam- 
ming by us. There were no radio 
communications anywhere in the 
world. 

XX 

T^OT only were we the ones 

’ who were trying to stop the 
war — it looked as though we had 
started it. For the naval action 
that Monmouth precipitated had 
spread. The Caodais had sunk 
her. A U.N. fleet had made a dar- 
ing raid into interdicted waters 
to try to rescue her. In retaliation, 
the Caodais had raided the Carib- 
bean again. In retaliation for that, 
a strike against Cebu. In retalia- 
tion for that — 

It had wound up with the satel- 
lite bombs. 

We looked at the situation map 
in the radio room and it was like 
the end of the world. There had 
been at least eighty fusion bombs 
dropped. 

And a weary, jittery black ra- 
dioman in a Caodai uniform was 
trying to get through with the 
message that might stop it all; 
but it was hopeless. 

The radioman glanced at us 
and shrugged. “Je m’y perds, vo- 
tre saintete,” he said. “Je ne puis 
pas.” 

Nguyen said tunelessly: “He 
cannot get through.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



A sous-tenente who spoke fair 
English cleared his throat and 
said: “Sir, perhaps if we have pa- 
tience, a time will come when we 
can get through. There have been 
breaks in the jamming; we re- 
ceived messages for nearly half 
an hour this morning.” 

“There will be no more breaks 
— except as the stations are 
bombed off the air.” Nguyen 
smiled wryly. “It is that which we 
wish to prevent.” 

Semyon looked up from the 
animals. “Fantastic,” he said, his 
eyes round. “It is not your wea- 
pon. It is not our weapon. Yet we 
bomb each other.” 

Nina Willette was still an In- 
telligence officer. She asked: 
“Have you really lost many peo- 
ple to this burning thing — I sup- 
pose I can’t call it the Glotch any 
more.” 

Nguyen hesitated only a mo- 
ment. Then he confessed: “More 
than seven hundred thousand. 
Nearly every one of our — what 
is your word? — our telepathists; 
and a few others. And you?” 

It was Nina’s turn to hesitate. 
Still, he had been frank with her, 
or had seemed to. “I have no offi- 
cial information. Perhaps half a 
million.” 

Half a million! Semyon and 
Elsie and I stared back and forth 
among ourselves. So many, I 
thought, how can there have been 
so many? But the more I thought. 



the more plausible it got. For 
even in my own small experience, 
there had been half a dozen or 
more. 

Half a million — one out of 
every five hundred or so on the 
North American continent! 

E lsie, surprisingly, 

grinned unhappily, and in 
that moment, she was my Elsie 
again. She took my hand. “No 
more calling up your wife just to 
see how she is, Logan. It’s too ex- 
pensive now — if this thing knocks 
off the espers, they’ll raise their 
rates. Is it always espers?”- 

“All,” said Nguyen. “Nearly all 
professionals, plus a few others 
who had recently been sensitized. 
And with you?” 

“I think so,” said Nina. “You 
understand that it was a highly 
classified matter with us — but I 
think so.” 

“You see?” Elsie clutched my 
hand. “From now on, esping will 
be only on matters of the gravest 
importance — on matters — on — ” 
She stared at me, then word- 
lessly at the useless radio. 

“On matters, she proclaims, of 
the gravest importance!” howled 
Semyon. “But naturally! They 
cannot jam the telepathic wave, 
however hard they try. It is our 
way to reach America!” 

Our way to reach America. 
But we didn’t have an esper 
at hand to do it. 



SLAVE SHIP 



139 



Nguyen sent scouts racing 
across the Madgascan littoral in 
all directions and they came back 
with psychologists, with Caodai 
military communications men, 
with a mixed bag of assorted pro- 
testing black, brown and yellow 
men and women. But not an esper 
in the lot. 

Nguyen snapped: “If you had 
not killed them off — ” He sagged. 
“My apology. If they had not 
died through this thing we both 
wish to combat, it would be easy. 
But there is scarcely a telepathist 
in all the lands of the Great Pal- 
ace. Hardly even a man who was 
sensitized, much less an expert.” 

Elsie looked at me and shook 
her head urgently. But all the 
same, I cleared my throat and 
said : 

“I was sensitized only a few 
weeks ago.” 

“I was sensitized last year,” 
Nina Willette volunteered sud- 
denly. 

No one else said anything at 
all. 

Then Elsie burst out: “That’s 
ridiculous, Logan! You’re no es- 
per; you only paid your money 
to use one. Good heavens, I was 
part of the same hookup, so if 
you — ” 

“I was sending,” I told her. 
“You were only receiving.” 

“But, Logan, ‘it’s dangerous! 
You heard what this man said. 
It’s bad enough in America, but 

140 



in Caodai territory, esping is a 
quick way to die. Don’t do it! Let 
that girl try!” 

T hen she looked me in the 
eye and stopped. “I’m sorry, 
darling,” she said defeatedly. 

“I was sensitized more re- 
cently than Nina,” I reminded 
her. 

“I know,” shq answered, almost 
inaudibly. 

“It, uh, it probably isn’t really 
dangerous. I still have my hel- 
met. I’ll just take it off to see if 
I can reach some American es- 
per. Then as soon as I’ve got 
through — ” 

She reached up and kissed me, 
hard. Then she turned away. “Get 
on with it,” she said over her 
shoulder. 

We talked to one of the psy- 
chologists Nuygen’s patrols had 
rounded up, a faded tan-skinned 
man with a bulbous face and a 
thin black mustache, who claimed 
to know a little about the theory 
of ESP. 

The sous-tenente translated: 
“You cannot reach anyone ex- 
cept a trained esper or one with 
whom you have had a — a — ex- 
cuse, but what is the English 
word for ‘rapport’?” 

“Rapport. Get cracking,” said 
Nina impatiently. 

The sous-tenente pursed his 
lips. “Curious. Well, then, you 
must try to reach someone with 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



whom you have formerly been 
in contact. Preferably an esper, 
if there is one. Think of him, and 
of the place where you saw him 
last, and of the sounds and smell 
of the room; recreate it all in 
your mind. But do not linger on 
a single person, for perhaps he 
is dead. Try one as best you can. 
If no answer, try another. You 
comprehend?” 

“I comprehend,” I said. “Let’s 
go.” 

We took off our aluminum 
helmets — that I, for one, had 
lived in, slept in, even bathed 
with for weeks. We lay down on 
hard cots in a room of the com- 
mand post and they closed the 
door. 

And then we tried to telepath. 

It was a funny sensation — 
something like trying to flex the 
fingers on a third hand. I was 
straining muscles that didn’t ex- 
ist, reaching through the void 
with limbs I did not own, shout- 
ing with vocal cords that should 
have been in the base of my skull 
and were not. In the hands of the 
esper, it had been quick and easy. 
There was the gray wandering 
and the sense of touching, and 
there was a contact. 

Now — nothing. 

%^E LAY there like a pair of 

” idiots. Could we ever reach 
anyone? Ridiculous, I thought. 
Could a jellyfish solve quadratic 



equations? The brain tissue, 
whatever it was that held the 
ESP-power, simply did not exist 
in us; we were not espers. 

I belligerently followed direc- 
tions, daring something to hap- 
pen. I thought of Giordano and 
his office on the Venetian Cause- 
way. 

Nothing. 

I thought of the smell of rot- 
ting palm trees and hibiscus, the 
warmth of the early summer 
Miami air, the way his breath 
had rasped as he was helping me 
reach Elsie. 

Nothing. 

All right, I said, I give up and 
thought of another esper, the in- 
competent one in Providence — 

And I got Giordano. 

Peevishly: Who the hell are 
you? Don’t you know this is dan- 
gerous? 

Not words, of course. I’ve ex- 
plained that esping is not a mat- 
ter of words. But an irritation, 
and a question, and a warning. 

I tried — as a blind castaway 
might try to spot a sail on the 
horizon — I tried, ineptly and 
without knowing whether I was 
succeeding, to convey what I had 
to say: The Glotch is not a Cao- 
dai weapon. It kills them as well 
as us. Tell the high command. 
Tell them to stop the bombs. The 
Caodai didn’t start the war. They 
are dying as rapidly as we. Stop 
it, stop it, until we find out . 



SLAVE SHIP 



141 



Until, finally, an incredulous- 
ness from Giordano, an under- 
standing, at last a belief and a 
promise. I could almost see him, 
seated at his desk, not in Miami 
now but in some colder, dryer 
place, staring at emptiness, con- 
versing with me. He was nodding, 
promising — 

Bright yellow fireflies came 
between us. 

I shook my head and the rap- 
port was gone. No more Gior- 
dano, no more sense of touch. 

But the fireflies were still 
there. They lanced through the 
base of my neck. I yelled out 
loud and clawed for the helmet 
I had dropped beside my cot. 
The pain was worse than that 
night along the drive at Miami 
Beach, worse than anything I had 
ever felt. I got the helmet and 
jammed it onto a head filled with 
hurting and flame. 

“Help!” I bawled, and I won- 
dered if the door was really open- 
ing, if people were really burst- 
ing in, if that was really Elsie 
clutching me in her arms. 

My head rolled to one side 
and I caught a glimpse of the 
cot next to mine. 

There was something there, 
something that had been a per- 
son, but it wasn’t Nina Merriam 
— not with blackness and horror 
where the pretty young face had 
been, not with the charred agony 
that was crisped into the expres- 



sion. Preposterous! It was a 
seared corpse. It couldn’t be Nina 
Merriam! 

But it was. So I found out — 
more than a week later, when 
they dared remove the needles, 
when they had stopped enough 
of the pain and patched enough 
of the ruin around my head and 
neck, and had begun to think I 
might yet live — the only man in 
all the world who had survived 
not a single attack of the what- 
ever-it-was, but two. 

A nd ELSIE was there. We 
didn’t talk for a while. And 
then we couldn’t stop. The war 
was over; I had after all got 
through, and so had Nina — be- 
fore she died. It was good that 
we both had made it, for they 
would scarcely have believed 
one. But you do not lie through 
ESP and two of us could hardly 
be mistaken. 

So they had stopped the 
bombs and the satellites hung 
silent in the sky. And the Cao- 
dais and we had begun to com- 
pare notes and to look for an- 
swers. Volunteers had offered 
themselves as sacrifice. Some had 
died, sitting in darkened rooms 
with opened photographic shut- 
ters waiting to catch the track 
of whatever came flashing in as 
they esped, a few coughing their 
lungs out in improvised cloud 
chambers, a great many sur-

rounded by infinite varieties of 
scientific equipment that tested 
and measured and felt. 

After a day, I was well enough 
to walk about. The grafts from 
the skin bank were healing and 
the damage to the nervous sys- 
tem was slight. And I had a visi- 
tor. I was in a naval hospital out- 
side of what had been New 
Washington and Nguyen had 
flown there to sign the Bethesda 
Compact. And he came to see me 
and to say: “Thank you.” 

That was the greatest shock of 
all. “For what?” I asked, blank. 

Nguyen laughed silently. “We 
are in your debt, my lieutenant,” 
he said. “We have learned to get 
along together, the Caodai and 
the West, and that is good. And 
even more, through your work 
with the dogs and monkeys and 
seals, we have learned to get 
along with our animals. And only 
just in time, my lieutenant. Only 
just in time.” 

“In time for what?” 

“What you call the Glotch. It 
wasn’t our weapon or yours. In 
fact, you see, it was not a weapon 
at all. Today the news is made: 
It is life.” 

“Life?” 

He nodded somberly. “Living 
things. Telepathic. Tiny, below 
the threshold of visibility. They 
seek to communicate when they 
sense the subtle esper flow and 
because their structure and ours 

SLAVE SHIP 



cannot exist together — they die. 
And perhaps that could be borne, 
but we die, too. As you know.” 

“Life!” I breathed. “How on 
Earth—” 

“Ah, no!” he cried. “Not on 
Earth at all. Mars? I don’t know 
— but not of the Earth, that is 
sure. And that is why we were 
only just in time. For now that 
we have learned to get along 
with each other, we start, this 
second, to learn to get along with 
Them. They have been attracted, 
the scientists think, by our esp- 
ing and perhaps also our bombs 
from outside. I doubt They will 
ever leave us alone again.” 

“Mars!” I breathed. It was 
fantastic. 

And also, of course, wrong — 
but how thoroughly wrong, we 
did not discover until Venus once 
more swam close to Earth. 

Nina Merriam would have 
liked to know. I wished somehow 
I could tell her. 

But I had Elsie to discuss it 
with. And, pretty soon, we had 
other things to talk about — dis- 
charge for both of us, a home, a 
job, a family — all the wonder- 
fully prosaic things that help 
wipe out years of loneliness and 
horror. 

But neither of us has forgotten 
Nina. 

We don’t want to and we 
won’t.

(^Continued from page 4) 
Arthur was preparing to invade 
Korea, the attack was scorn- 
fully called “Operation Common 
Knowledge” because everything 
was known about it, including the 
target. 

“Hah!” the Chinese must have 
said in top-level conference. “Very 
clumsy, trying to make us think 
we will strike at Inchon.” So they 
dug in everywhere but at Inchon 
— and that, of course, was exactly 
where MacArthur landed. 

This kind of disarmingly di- 
rect thinking was proposed for the 
problem of captured soldiers. By 
ordering them to broadcast or sign 
any “confession” demanded of 
them, all propaganda would have 
been denied the enemy. The pro- 
posal was defeated, but I’m not 
sure I see why. 

Maybe because this approach 
is expected from young children 
only. 

A father with a very large 
package joshed his son, who, 
wearing a Superman costume, 
was leaping all around the yard: 
“Come on. Superman, help me get 
this inside the house.” The child 
sized up the bulk and heft of the 
package. “I’m not Superman,” he 
said realistically. “I’m just a lit- 
tle boy and I can’t carry any- 
thing like that.” 

Lincoln Steffens’ Autobiogra- 
phy shows how flabbergasting 
literal thinking can be on an adult

level. A Philadelphia political 
ring had five huge graft projects 
to put across. The lieutenants’ 
opinion was to pull them separ- 
ately, giving the public time to 
cool off in between. The big boss, 
however, decided to spring all 
five at once. They did — and such 
cosmic gall demoralized all op- 
position. 

The devious minds contribute 
immensely, especially- to the sci- 
ences, but mainly to provide the 
data that the rare Newtons and 
Einsteins — > unswervingly literal, 
all of them — reduce to unbelieva- 
bly simple equations, which the 
devious scoff at; nothing could be 
that simple. 

The method is equally clear — 
find the most direct solution. Sci- 
ence fiction has done that often. 
Fifty years ago. Wells saw that 
the way to conquer gravity was 
to nullify it. (Verne scoffed.) 
Now there’s an anti-gravity re- 
search program, while Verne’s 
elaborate Moon cannon has long 
been obsolete. 

Does that mean the literal 
mind is superior to the devious? 
No, they need each other. 

It’s just that the literal mind, 
traveling in a straight line, has to 
wait for the devious to catch up. 
It will. 

It always has — so far, at 
least. 

But if only they were tolerant 
of each other!
