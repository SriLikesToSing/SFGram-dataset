DEATH AND DESIGNATION ^ 
AMONG THE ASADI 



MICHAEL BISHOP 



4 



Being sundry notes for an abor- 
tive ethnography of the Asadi 
of Bosk Veld, fourth planet of 
the Denebolan system, as 
compiled from the journals 
(both private and professional), 
official reports, private cor- 
respondence, and tapes of Egan 
Chaney, cultural xenologist, by 
his friend and associate, 
Thomas Benedict. 



Preliminaries: reverie and departure 
From the private journals of 
Egan Chaney: There are no more 
pygmies. Intellectual pygmies 
perhaps, but no more of those 
small, alert, sway-backed black 
people of necessarily amenable dis- 
position who lived in the dead-and- 
gone Ituri rain forests — a people, 
by the way, whom I do not wish to 
sentimentalize (though perhaps 1 
may). Pygmies no longer exist — 
they have been dead for centuries. 
But on the evening before the 
evening when Benedict dropped me 
into the singing fronds of the 
Synesthesia Wild under three bitter 
moons they lived again for me. I 
spent that last evening in base camp 
rereading Turnbull’s The Forest 
People. Dreaming, I lived with the 
people of the Ituri. I underwent 
nkumbi, the ordeal of circumcision. 
I dashed beneath the belly of an 
elephant and jabbed that monstrous 
creature’s flesh with my spear. Fi- 
nally I took part in the festival of 
the molimo with the ancient and 
clever BaMbuti. All in all, I sup- 
pose, my reading was a sentimental 
exercise. Turnbull’s book had been 
the first and most vivid ethnog- 
raphy I had encountered in my un- 



dergraduate career— and even on 
that last night in base camp on the 
hostile world of BoskVeld, a planet 
circling the star Denebola, his book 
sang in my head like the forbidden 
lyrics of the pygmies’ molimo, like 
the poignant melodies of Bosk- 
Veld’s moons. 

A sentimental exercise. 

What good my reading would do 
me among the inhabitants of the 
Synesthesia Wild, I had no idea. 
Probably none. But I was going out 
there and on the evening before my 
departure, the day before my sub- 
mersion, I lost myself in the forests 
of another time — knowing that for 
the next several months I would 
the waking and wakeful prisoner of 
the hominoids who were my sub- 
jects. We had killed off all the 
primitive peoples of Earth, but on 
paradoxical BoskVeld I still had a 
job. And when Benedict turned the 
copter under those three antique- 
gold moons and flew it back to base 
camp like a crepitating dragonfly, I 
knew that I had to pursue that job. 
The jungle, however, was bleak — 
and strange — and nightmarishly 
real; and all 1 could think was 
There are no more pygmies, there 
are no more pygmies, there are no 

Methods: a dialogue 

From the professional, notebooks 
of Egan Chaney: I was not the first 
Earthman to go among the Asadi, 
but I was the first to live with thein 
for an extended period of time. The 
first of us to encounter the Asadi 
was Oliver Bow Aurm Frasier, the 
man who gave these hominoids 
their name — perhaps on analogy 
with the word Ashanti, the name of 
an African people who still exist.

IF 




but more likely from the old Arabic 
word asad meaning lion. 

Oliver Bow‘ Aurm Frasier had 
reported that the Asadi of Bosk- 
Veld had no speech ^as we under- 
stood this concept, but that at one 
time they had possessed a “written 
language.” He used both these 
words loosely. I’m sure, and the 
anomaly of writing without speech 
was one that I hoped to throw some 
light on. In addition, Frasier had 
said that an intrepid ethnographer 
might hope to gain acceptance 
among the Asadi by a singularly 
unorthodox stratagem. I will 
describe this stratagem by setting 
down here an imaginary con- 
versation that I could have had with 
Benedict (but didn’t). 

BENEDICT: Listen, Chaney [I, by 
the way, am Egan Chaney), what 
do you plan on doing after 1 drop 
you all by your lonesome into the 
Synesthesia Wild? You aren’t 
thinking of using the standard an- 
thropological \pl6y, are you? You 
know, marching right into the 
Asadi hamlet and exclaiming, “1 
am the Great White God of whom 
your legends foretell.” 

CHANEY: Not exactly. As a mat- 
ter of fact. I’m not going into the 
Asadi clearing until morning. 

BENEDICT: Then why the hell do I 
have to copter you into the Wild in 
the middle of the goddamn night? 

CHANEY: To humor a lovable ec- 
centric. No, No, Benedict, don’t re- 
vile me. The matter is fairly simple. 
Frasier said that the Asadi com- 
munity clearing is absolutely vacant 
during the night — not a soul re- 
mains there between dusk and 
sunrise. The community members 
return to the clearing only when 



Denebola has grown fat and cop- 
pery on the eastern horizon. 

BENEDICT: And you want to be 
dropped at night? 

CHANEY: Yes, to give the noise of 
your copter a chance to fade and be 
forgotten and to afford me the op- 
portunity of walking into the Asadi 
clearing with the first morning ar- 
rivals. Just as if I belonged there. 

BENEDICT: Oh, indeed— yes. 

You’ll be very inconspicuous, 
Chaney. You’ll be accepted im- 
mediately — even though the Asadi 
go about naked, have eyes that look 
like the murky glass in the bottoms 
of old bottles and boast great 
natural collars of silver or tawny 
fur. Oh, indeed — yes. 

CHANEY: Well, Frasier called the 
stratagem that I hope to employ 
“acceptance through social invisi- 
bility.” The principle is again a 
simple one. I must feign the role of 
an Asadi pariah. This tactic gains 
me a kind of acceptance because 
Asadi mores demand that the 
pariah’s presence be totally 
ignored. He is outcast not in a 
physical sense, but in a psycho- 
logical one. Consequently my 
presence in the clearing will be a 
negative one, an admission I’ll 
readily make — but in some ways 
this negative existence will permit 
m^ more latitude df movement and 
observation than if I were an Asadi 
in good standing. 

BENEDICT: Complicated, Chaney, 
very complicated. It leaves me with 
two burning questions. How does 
one go about achieving pariahhood 
and what happens to the anthropol- 
ogist’s crucial role as a gatherer of 
folk material — songs, cosmologies, 
ritual incantations? I mean, won’t 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



7 




your “invisibility” deprive you of 
your cherished one-to-one rela- 
tionships with those Asadi 
members who might be most 
informative? 

CHANEY: ru take your last 

question first. Frasier told us that 
the Asadi don’t communicate 
through speech. That in itself pretty 
well limits me to observation. No 
need to worry about songs or in- 
cantations. llieir cosmologies I’ll 
have to infer from what I see. As 
for their methods of interpersonal 
communication — even should I dis- 
cover what these are, I may not be 
physically equipped to use them. 
The Asadi aren’t human, Ben. - 

benedict: I’m aware. Fre- 

quently, listening to you, I begin 
to think speechlessness might be a 
genetically desirable condition. All 
right. Enough. What about at- 
taining to pariahhood? 

CHANEY: We still don’t know very 
much about which offenses warrant 
this extreme punishment. However, 
we do know how the Asadi distin- 
guish the outcast from the other 
members of the community. 

BENEDICT: How? 

CHANEY: They shave the of- 
fender’s collar of fur. Since all 
Asadi possess these manes, 
regardless of sex or age, this 
method of distinguishing the pariah 
is universal and certain. 

BENEDICT: Then you’re already a 
pariah? 

CHANEY: I hope so. I just haVe to 
remember to shave evej7 day. 
Frasier believed that his hair- 
lessness — he was nearly bald — was 
what allowed him to make those 
few discoveries about the Asadi we 
now possess. But he arrived among 



them during a period of strange 
inactivity and had to content 
himself with studying the artifacts 
of an older Asadi culture, the re- 
mains of a huge winged pagoda in 
the Synesthesia Wild. Too, I’ve 
heard that Frasier didn’t really 
have the kind of patience that’s 
essential for field work. 

BENEDICT: Just a minute. Back up 
a little. Couldn’t one of the Asadi 
be shorn of his mane accidentally? 
He’d be an outcast through no fault 
of his own, wouldn’t he? An artn 
ficial pariah? 

CHANCY: It’s not very likely. 
Frasier reported that the Asadi 
have no natural enemies — that, in 
fact, the Synesthesia Wild seems to 
be almost completely devoid of any 
life beyond the Asadi themselves. 
In any case, the loss of one’s collar 
through whatever means is 
considered grounds for punishment. 
That’s the only offense that Frasier 
pretty well confirmed. What the 
others are, as I said, we really don’t 
know. 

BENEDICT: If the jungles are de- 
void of other life — save inedible bo- 
tanicals — Chaney, what do the 
poor Asadi live on? 

CHANEY: We don’t know that 
either. 

BENEDICT: Well, listen, Chaney— 
what do you plan to live on? I 
mean, even Malinowski con- 
descended to eat now and again. 
At least, that’s what I hear. 

CHANEY: That’s where you come 
in, Ben. I’m going to carry in suffi- 
cient rations to see me through a 
week. But eachxweek for the next 
several months you’ll have to make 
a food and supply drop in the place 
where you first set me down. I’ve

IF 




already picked the spot— I know its 
distance and direction from the 
Asadi clearing. It’ll be expensive, 
but the people in base camp — Eisen 
in particular— have agreed that my 
work is necessary. You won’t be 
forced to defend the drops. 

BENEDICT: But why so often? 
Why once a week? 

CHANEY: That’s Eisen’s idea, not 
mine. Since I told him I was going, 
to refuse any sort of contact at all 
during my stay with the Asadi — 
any contact with you people, that 
is — he decided that the weekly drop 
would be the best way to make 
certain, occasionally, that I’m still 
alive. 

BENEDICT: A weapon, Chaney? 

CHANEY: No, no weapons. 

Besides food I’ll take in nothing but 
my notebooks, a recorder, some 
reading material and maybe a little 
something to get me over the 
inevitable periods of depression. 

BENEDICT: A radio? In case you 
need immediate help? 

CHANEY: No. I may get ill once or 
twice, but I’ll always have the flares 
if things get really bad. Placenol 
and bourbon, too. Nevertheless, I 
insist on complete separation from 
any of the affairs of base camp until 
my stay among the Asadi is over. 

BENEDICT: Why are you doing 
this? I don’t mean why did Eisen 
decide we ought to study the Asadi 
so minutely. I mean, why are you, 
Egan Chaney, committing yourself 
to this ritual sojourn among an 
alien people? There are one or two 
others at base camp who might 
have gone if they had had the 
chance. 

CHANEY: Because, Ben, there are 
no more pygmies . 



End of simulated dialogue on 
initial methods. I suppose I have 
made Benedict out to be a much 
more inquisitive fellow than he ac- 
tually is. All those well-informed 
questions! In truth, Ben is taciturn 
and sly at once. But when you read 
the notes for this ethnography, Ben, 
remember that I let you get in one 
or two unanswered hits at me. Can 
friendship go deeper? As a man 
whose life’s work involves ac- 
cepting a multitude of perspectives, 

I believe I have played you fair, 
Ben. 

Forgive me my trespass. 

Contact and assimilation 

From the private Journals of 
Egan Chaney: Thinking There are 
no more pygmies there are no more 
pygmies there are no ... I lay down 
beneath a tree that resembled an 
outsized rubber plant and I slept. I 
slept without dreaming — or else I 
had grotesque nightmares that, 
upon waking, I suppressed. A wrist 
alarm woke me. The light from 
Denebola had begun to coppercoat 
the edges of the leaves in the 
Synesthesia Wild. Still, dawn had 
not quite come. ,The world was 
silent. I refused to let the Wild dis- 
tort my senses. I did not wish to cut 
myself on the crimsons and the 
yellows and the orchid blues. 
Neither did I have^any desire to 
taste the first slight treacherous 
breeze nor to hear the dawn 
detonate behind my retinas. 
Therefore I shook myself awake 
and began walking. Beyond the 
brutal need of having to maintain 
my direction I paid no attention to 
my surroundings. The^ clearing 
where the Asadi would soon con- 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI

gregate compelled me toward it. 
That fateful place drew me on. 
Everything else slipped out of my 
consciousness — blazing sky, moist 
earth, singing fronds. Would the 
Asadi accept me among them — on 
external signs alone— as they nega- 
tively accept their outcasts? Upon 
this hope I had founded nearly six 
months of future activity — not a 
whit of my master strategy had I 
based on the genuine substance of 
this condition. Externality vs. 
substance. It was too late to reverse 
either my aims or the direction of 
my footsteps. Let the doubt die. 
Pattern the sound of your footfalls 
after the pattern of falling feet — 
those falling feet that converge with 
' you upon the clearing where the fo- 
liage parts and the naked Asadi 
assemble like a convention of 
unabashed mutes. I so patterned 
the sounds of my footfalls. 
Glimpsed through rents in the fret- 
work of leaves, an Asadi’s flashing 
arm. Seen as a shadow among 
other shadows on the ground, the 
forward-moving image of an 
Asadi’s maned head. The Wild 
trembled with morning movement. 
I was surrounded by unseen and 
half-seen communicants, all of us 
converging. And then the foliage 
parted and we were together on the 
open jungle floor — the Asadi 
clearing, the holy ground perhaps, 
the unadorned territory ^ of 
gregariousness and communion, 
the focal point pf Asadi life. The 
awesome odor of this life — so much 
milling life — assailed me. No mat- 
ter. I adjusted. Great gray-fleshed 
creatures, their heads heavy with 
violent drapings of fur, milled 
about me, turned about one 



another, came back to me, sought 
confirmation of my essential 
whatness. I could do nothing but 
wait. I waited. My temples pulsed. 
Denebola shot poniards of light 
through the trees. Hovering, then 
moving away, averting their murky 
eyes the Asadi — individual by indi- 
vidual, I noticed — made their de- 
cision and that first indispensable 
victory was in my grasp: 

I was ignored! 

Xenology: in-the-fieid report 

FroM the, professional tapes of the 
library of the Third Denebolan 
Expedition: I have been here two 
weeks. Last night I picked up the 
second of Benedict’s food drops. It 
is fortunate that they come on time, 
that they arrive on the precise coor- 
dinates where Benedict first set me 
down. The Asadi do not eat as we 
do and the Synesthesia Wild pro- 
vides me with foodstuffs neither in 
the way of edible vegetation nor in 
that of small game animals. I can- 
not tolerate the platnts. As the bio- 
chemists in base camp predicted, 
they induce almost immediate 
vomiting or their furry bitterness 
dissuades me from swallowifig 
tl^m. There are no animals. The 
jungle is alive, but with writhing 
fronds and with the heat, the steam, 
the infrasonic vibrancy of continual 
photosynthesis. Rainwater I can 
drink. Thank God for that, even 
though I boil it before truly 
considering it potable. 

' I have reached a few purely 
speculative conclusions about the 
Asadi. 

With them nothing is certain, 
nothing is fixed. Their behavior, 
though it must necessarily have a 



10 



IF 




deep-seated social function, does 
not make sense to me. At this stage, 
I keep telling myself, that’s to be 
expected. You must persist, you 
must refuse to be discouraged. 
Therefore, I extrapolated from my 
own condition to theirs. I asked 
myself. If you cant subsist on what 
BoskVeld gives you— how do the 
Asadi? My observations in this area 
(and for fear of Benedict’s kindly 
ridicule I hesitate to put it this way) 
have borne fruit, have given me the 
intellectual nourishment to combat 
despair. Nothing else on BoskVeld 
has offered me consolation. 

In answer to the question. What 
do the Asadi eat? 1 can say, quite 
without fear of contradiction. 
Everything that I do not. They ap- 
pear to be herbivorous. In fact, they 
go beyond the unsurprising 
consumption of plants: they eat 
wood. Yes, wood. I have seen them 
strip bark from the rubber trees and 
ingest it without qualm. I have 
watched them eat pieces of the very 
heart of young saplings, wood of 
what we would consider a pro- 
hibitive' hardness — even for crea- 
tures equipped to process it 
internally. 

Three days ago I boiled down 
several pieces of bark, the sort of 
bark that I had seen many of the 
young Asadi consume. I boiled it 
until the pieces were limply pliable. 
I managed to chew the bark for 
several semi-profitable minutes 
and, finally, to swallow it. 
Checking my stool nearly a day 
later 1 found that this meal had 
gone, right through me. What, after 
all, does bark consist of? Cellulose. 
Indigestible cellulose. And yet the 
Asadi, who possess teeth not much 



different from ours, eat wood and 
also digest it. How? 

Again I have to speculate. I am 
hindered by my lack of detailed 
knowledge about anything other 
than human beings. Nevertheless, 
hunkering here on the edge of the 
Asadi clearing as the dusk grows 
more and more ominous, hunkering 
here and talking into a microphone 
(Testing, one — two — three, testing, 
testing), I will offer all you hyper- 
critical and exacting people in the 
hard sciences an analogy. A ridicu- 
lous analogy perhaps. If you don’t 
like it I’ll undoubtedly defer to your 
judgment and back off. But just as 
primitive shamans must attempt to 
explain the world in their own 
terms, 1, Egan Chaney, isolated 
from my fellows, must conjure up 
explanations of my own. Here is 
one: I believe that the Asadi digest 
wood in the same manner as 
Earthly termites — that is, through 
the aid of bacteria in their 
intestines, protozoa that break 
down the cellulose. A symbiosis, 
Eisen would say. And let that be a 
lesson to us all. It’s time that people 
learned to get along with one 
another. Bacteria and Chinamen, 
legumes and pygmies. 

This is later. Tonight I have to 
talk, even if it’s only to a 
microphone. With the coming of 
darkness the Asadi have disap- 
peared again into the jungle and 
I’m alone. 

For the first three nights that I 
was here 1, too, returned to the 
Wild when Denebola set. I returned 
to the place where Benedict drop- 
ped me, curled up beneath the 
overhanging palm leaves, slept 
through the night and then joined

the dawn's inevitable pilgrimage 
back to this clearing. Now I remain 
here through the night. I sleep on 
the clearing's edge, just deep 
enough into the foliage to find 
shelter. I go back into the jungle 
only to retrieve my food drops. 

Although the Asadi disapprove of 
my behavior, 1 am an outcast and 
they can do nothing to discipline me 
away from my unacceptable 
conduct without violating their own 
injunction against acknowledging a 
pariah's existence. As they depart 
each evening a few of the older 
Asadi, those with streaks of white 
in their mangy collars, halt momen- 
tarily beside me and breathe with 
exaggerated heaviness. They don't 
look at me because that's taboo. 
But I, in turn, don't look at them — 
I ignore them as if they were the 
pariahs. As a result I've been able 
to dispense altogether with those 
senseless and wearying treks in and 
out of the clearing that so ex- 
hausted me at first. 

My behavioral studies during the 
day, however, go on unabated. 

To absolve myself of what may 
seem a lack of thoroughness I 
ought to mention, I suppose, that 
on my fourth and fifth nights here I 
attempted to follow two different 
Asadi specimens into the jungle in 
order to determine where they 
slept, how they slept and what occu- 
pi^ their waking time away from 
the clearing. I was unsuccessful in 
these attempts. 

When evening comes the Asadi 
disperse. This dispersal is complete. 
No two individuals remain 
together, not even the young with 
their parents. Each Asadi finds a 
place of his own, a place utterly 



removed from that of any other 
member of his species. (This 
practice, by the way, runs counter 
to my experience with every other 
social group that I've ever studied.) 
On the fourth and fifth nights, 
then, I was humiliatingly out- 
distanced by the objects of my pur- 
suit. Nor can I suppose that I'd 
have any greater success with dif- 
ferent specimens, since I purposely 
chose to follow an aged and de- 
crepit-seeming Asadi on the first 
evening and a small prepubescent 
creature on the second. Both ran 
with convincing strength, flashed 
into the trees — as if still arboreal by 
nature — and then flickered from 
my vision. 

All three moons are up, burnt- 
gold and unreal. I'm netted in by 
shadows and my growing 
loneliness. Field conditions, to be 
frank, have never before been quite 
so austere for me and I've begun to 
wonder if the Asadi were ever in- 
telligent creatures. Maybe I'm 
studying a variety of Denebolan ba- 
boon. Oliver Bow Aurm Frasier, 
though, reported that the Asadi 
once had both a written “language" 
and a distinctive system of archi- 
tecture. He didn't bother to tell us 
how he reached these conclusions — 
but the Synesthesia Wild, I'm 
certain, contains many secrets. 
Later I'll be more venturesome. But 
for the present I've got to try to 
understand those Asadi who are 
alive today. They're the key to their 
own past. 

One or two things — final ones — 
before I attempt to sleep. 

First, the eyes of the Asadi. These 
are somewhat as Benedict briefly 
described them in the imaginary

IF 




dialogue that I composed a week 
ago today. That is, like the bottoms 
of thick-glassed bottles. Except that 
I’ve noted that the eye really 
consists of two parts — a thin 
transparent covering, which is ap- 
parently hard, like plastic, and the 
membranous organ of sight that 
this covering protects. It’s as if each 
Asadi were bom wearing a built-in 
pair of safety glasses. Frasier’s im- 
pression of their eyes as murky is 
one not wholly supported by 
continued observation. What he 
saw as “murkiness” probably 
resulted from the fact that the eyes 
of the Asadi, behind the other lens 
or cap, are constantly changing 
colors. Sometimes the rapidity with 
which a sienna replaces an indigo — 
and then a green the sienna, and so 
on — makes it difficult for a mere 
human being to see any particular 
color at all — maybe this is the ex- 
planation for Frasier’s designation 
of their eyes as “murky.” I don^t 
know. I am certain, though, that 
this chameleonic quality of the 
Asadi’s eyes has social significance. 

And a second thing: Despite the 
complete absence of a discernible 
social order among the Asadi I may 
today have witnessed an event of 
the first importance to my unsuc- 
cessful, so far, efforts to chart their 
group relationships. Maybe. 
Maybe not. Previously, no real 
order at all existed. Dispersal at 
night, then congregation in the 
morning — if you choose to call that 
order. But nothing else. Random 
milling about during the day, with 
no set times for eating, sex, or their 
habitual bloodless feuds; random 
plunges into the jungle at night. 
Upon Denebola’s setting no

creature ever heads in the same di- 
rection twice. 

What's a humble Earthman to 
make of all this? A society held 
together by institutionalized anti- 
socialness? What happened today 
leads me irrevocably away from 
that possibility. 

Maybe. 

This afternoon an aged Asadi 
whom I had never seen before 
stumbled into the clearing. His 
mane was grizzled, his face 
wizened, his hands shriveled, his 
gray b<^y bleached to a filthy 
cream. But so agile was he in the 
Synesthesia Wild that no one de- 
tected his presence until his incon- 
gruously clumsy entry into the 
clearing. Then everyone fled from 
him. Unconcerned, he sat down in 
the center of the Asadi gathering 
place and folded his long naked 
legs. By this time all of his kinsmen 
were in the jungle staring back at 
him from the edge of the clearing. 
Only at sunset had I ever before 
seen the Asadi desert the clearing 
en masse. Hence my certainty that 
what happened today is of prime 
importance to my mission here. 

But I haven’t yet exhausted the 
strangeness of this old man’s visit. 
You see, Moses, he came accom- 
panied. And not by another Asadi. 

He came with a small purplish- 
black creature perched on his 
shoulder. It resembled a raven, a 
bat and a deformed homunculus all 
at once. But whereas the old man 
had great round eyes that changed 
color extremely slowly, if at all, the 
creature on his shoulder had not 
even a pair of empty sockets — it 
was blind. It lacked any organs of 
sight. It sat on the aged Asadi’s 



shoulder and manipulated its tiny 
hands compulsively, tugging at the 
old man’s mane, opening and 
closing them on empty air, then 
tugging again at its protector’s griz- 
zl^ collar. 

Both the old man and his beast- 
like/manlike familiar had a furious 
unreality. They existed at a 
spiritual as well as a physical 
distance and I noted that the rest of 
the Asadi — those who surrounded 
and ignored me on the edge of the 
“communion” ground — behaved 

not as if they feared these sudden 
visitors but rather as if they felt a 
loathsome kinship with them. This 
is difficult to express. Bear with me, 
Eisen. 

Maybe another analogy will help. 

Let me say that the Asadi 
behaved toward their visitors as a 
fastidious son might behave toward 
a father who has contracted veneral 
disease. Ambivalence is all in such 
cases. Shame and respect, distance 
and intimacy, love and loathing. 

But the episode concluded 
abruptly when the old man rose 
from the ground, oblivious to the 
slow swelling and sedate flapping of 
his huri (that’s a portmanteau word 
for fury and harpy that I’ve just 
coined) and stalked back into the 
Wild, scattering a number of Asadi 
in his wake. 

Then everything went back to 
normal. The clearing filled again 
and the ceaseless and senseless 
milling about resumed. 

God, it’s amazing how lonely 
loneliness can be when the sky 
contains three jagged, nuggetlike 
moons and the human being inside 
you has involuntarily abdicated to 
the essence of that which should

That’s a mouthful, isn’t it? What I 
mean is that there’s a small struggle 
going on between Egan Chaney, the 
cultural xenologist, and Egan 
Chaney, the quintessential man. No 
doubt it’s the result more of envi- 
ronmental pressure than of my

That’s a little anthropological 
allusion, Benedict. Don’t worry 
about it. You aren’t supposed to

But enough. Today’s atypical oc- 
currence has sharpened my appetite 
for observation — it has temporarily 
calmed my internal struggle. I’m 
ready to stay here a year if need be, 
even though the original plan was

The Asadi clearing: a clarification 

From the professional journals of 
Egan Chaney: My greatest colle- 
giate failing was an inability to or- 
ganize. I am pursued by that 
specter even ^oday. Consequently, a 
digression of sorts. In looking over 
these quirkish notes for my formal 
ethnography, I realize that I may 
have given the student the com- 
pletely false idea that the Asadi 
clearing is a small area of ground, 
say, fifteen by fifteen, measuring in 
meters. Not so. As well as I am 
able to determine there are ap- 
proximately a thousand Asadi indi- 
viduals on hand daily — this figure 
includes mature adults, the young 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



15 





and those intermediate between age 
and youth. Of course, during all my 
time in the Synesthesia Wild I’ve 
never been completely sure that the 
same individuals return to the 
clearing each morning. It may be 
that some sort of monumental shift 
takes place in the jungle, one group 
of Asadi replacing another each 
day. But I doubt it. The Wild en- 
compasses a finite area, after all, 
and I have learned to recognize a 
few of the more distinctive Asadi 
(more on this point later, gentle 
reader). A thousand still seems 
about right to me: a thousand gray- 
fleshed creatures strolling, halting, 
bending at the waist and glaring at 
one another, eating, participating in 
random sex acts, grappling like 
wrestlers, obeying no time scheme, 
sequence, or apprehensible ra- 
tionale. Such activity requires a lit- 
tle space. Therefore the reader may 
not cheerfully assume that the 
Asadi communion ground is a five- 
by-eight mud flat between a Bosk- 
Veld cypress and a malodorous 
sump hole. Not at all. Their com- 
munion ground has both size and 
symmetry and the Asadi maintain 
it discrete from the encroaching 
jungle by their unremitting daily 
activity. I will not quote you dimen- 
sions, however. I will say only that 
the clearing has the rectangular 
shape, the characteristic slope and 
the practical roominess of a 
twentieth-century football field. 
Pure coincidence. I’m sure. As- 
troturf and lime-rendered ehdzones 
are conspicuously absent. 

A dialogue of self and soul 

From the private correspondence 
of Egan Chaney: The title of this 



exercise is from Yeats, dear Ben. 
The substance of the dialogue, 
however, has almost nothing to do 
with the poem of the same name. 

I wrote this imaginary exchange 
in one of my notebooks while 
waiting out a particularly long 
night on the edge of the Asadi 
clearing (just off the imaginary 
thirty-yard-line on the south end of 
the field, western sideline) and I 
intend for no one to read it, Ben, 
but you. Its lack of objectivity and 
the conclusions drawn by the par- 
ticipants make it unsuitable for any 
sort of appearance in the formal 
ethnography that I have yet to 
write.* 

But you, Ben, will understand 
that a scientist is also a man and 
may perhaps forgive me. Since even 
futbol fanatics of Century re- 
quired announcers to describe the 
action or binoculars through which 
to see it, 1 herewith provide a pro- 
gram. You can’t tell the players 
without a program. The numbers

SOUL: Fve been here forever. But 
let that go. What have you learned? 

self: Most of my observations 
lead me to state emphatically that 
the Asadi are not fit subjects for 
anthropological study. They 
manifest no purposeful social 
activity. They do not use tools. 
They have less social organization 
than did most of the extinct Earthly 
printates. Only the visit, four days 
ago, of the old “man” and his 
frightening companion indicates 
even a remote possibility that I am 
dealing with intelligence. How can I 
continue? 

SOUL: You will continue out of 
comtempt for the revulsion that 
daily grows in you. Because the 
Asadi are, in fact, intelligent — just 
as Oliver Bow Aurm Frasier said 
they were. 

SELF: But how do I know that, 
damn it, how do I know what you 
insist is true? Blind acceptance of 
Frasier’s word? 

SOUL: There are signs. Dr. 

Chaney. The eyes, for instance. But 
even if there weren’t any signs 
you’d know tlmt the Asadi are as 
intelligent in their own way as you 
or I. Wouldn’t you, Egan? 

SELF: I admit it. Their elusive in- 
telligence haunts me. 

SOUL: No, now you’ve misstated 
the facts. You’ve twisted things 
around horribly. 

SELF: How? What do you mean? 

s^ouL: You are not the one who is 
haunted, Egan Chaney, for you’re 
too rational a creature to be the 
prey of poltergeist. I am the 
haunted one, the bedeviled one, the 
one ridden by every insidious spirit 
of doubt and revulsion. 

SELF: Revulsion? You’ve used 




DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI

that word twice. Why do you insist 
upon it? What does it mean? 

SOUL: That I hate the Asadi. I 
despise their every culturally sig- 
nificant — or insign ificant — act. 

They curdle my essence with their 
very alienness. And because affect 
me so you, too. Dr. Chaney, hate 
them — for you are simply the civi- 
lized veneer on my primordial 
responses to the world. You are 
haunted not by the Asadi, friend, 
but by me. 

SELF: While you in turn are 
haunted by them? Is that how you 
view it? 

SOUL: That’s how it is. But al- 
though you’re aware of my hatred 
for the Asadi, you pretend that that 
portion of my hatred which seeps 
into you is only a kind of 
professional resentment. You 
believe that you resent the Asadi 
for destroying your objectivity, 
your scientific detachment. In truth 
this detachment does not exist. You 
feel the same powerful revulsion for 
their alienness that works in me like 
a disease, the same abiding and 
deep-seated hatred. I haunt you. 

self: With hatred for the Asadi? 

SOUL: Yes. Admit it, Egan. 
Admit that even as a scientist you 
hate them. 

SELF: No. No, damn you, 1 won’t. 
Because we killed the pygmies, 
every one of them. How can I say, I 
hate the Asadi, / hate the Asadi, . 
when we killed every pygmy? Even 
though, my God, I do. 

Daily life: in-the-field report 

From the professional tapes of 
the library of the Third Denebolan 
Expedition: Once again it’s 

evening. I’ve a lean-to now. It 



protects me from the rain much 
better than did the porous roof of 
the forest. I’ve been here twenty- 
two days. My flesh has mildewed. 
Beneath this mildewed flesh my 
muscles crawl like the evil snakes 
that BoskVeld doesn’t possess. I 
am saturated with Denebola’s 
garish light. I am Gulliver among 
the Yahoos and even my own fa- 
miliar voice speaking into this fa- 
miliar little recorder doesn’t 
comfort me. 

This, however, isn’t what you 
want to hear. 

You want facts. You want my 
conclusions about the behavior of 
the Asadi. You want evidence that 
we’re studying a life form with at 
least a fundamental degree of the 
ability to ratiocinate. The Asadi 
have this ability, I swear it. I know 
it. But in my first week or two here 
my knowledge stemmed almost 
entirely from a hunch, a conviction 
with no empirical basis. 

But slowly the evidence for in- 
telligence has begun to accumulate. 

Okay. Let me, then, deliver 
myself of an in-the-field report as 
an objective scientist and forget the 
hunches of my mortal self. Some- 
body in grad school used to say 
that. I’m sure. At any rate, the rest 
of this tape will deal with the daily 
life of the Asadi. 

A day in the life of. A typical day 
in the life of. 

Except that I’m going to cap my 
reporting of mundane occurrences 
with the account of an extraordi- 
nary event that took place just this 
afternoon. Like Thoreau, I’m going ^ 
to compress time to suit my own ar- 
tistic/scientific purposes. So hang 
on, gang. 



18 



IF 




At dawn the Asadi return to their 
football field. For approximately 
twelve hours they mill about in the 
clearing doing whatever they care 
to do. Sexual activity and quirkish 
staring matches are the only sorts 
of behavior that can in any way be 
called “social” — unless you believe 
milling about in a crowd qualifies. I 
call their daylight way of life Indif- 
ferent Togetherness. 

But when the Asadi engage in 
coitus, their indifference dissolves 
and gives way to a brutal 
hostility — both partners behave as 
if they desire to kill the other and 
frequently this is nearly the result. 
(I haven’t yet witnessed the birth of 
an Asadi, in case you’re wondering. 
Maybe the bearii^ of young occurs 
only in the Synesthesia Wild, the fe- 
male self-exiled and unattended. I 
can’t yet say for certain.) As forthe 
staring matches, they’re of brief du- 
ration and involve fierce gesticu- 
lation and mane-shaking. In thesq 
head-to-head confrontations the 
eyes change color with astonishing 
rapidity, flashing through the entire 
visible spectrum — and maybe be- 
yond — in a matter of seconds. 

I’m now prepared to say that 
these instantaneous clmnges of eye 
color are the Asadi equivalent of 
speech. I’m sure that you, Eisen, 
would have ventured this theory 
much sooner than I have, had you 
been here — but I’m uneasy about 
the biological aspects of any 
cultural study and must go slow. 
Three weeks of observation have fi- 
nally convinced me that the ad- 
versaries in these staring matches 
control the internal chemical 
changes that trigger the changes in 
the succeeding hues of their eyes. In 



other words, patterns exist. And the 
minds that control these chemical 
changes cannot be priniitive ones. 
Nor can I believe that the changes 
in eye color result from involuntary 
reflex. The alterations are willed. 
They’re infinitely complicated. 

Old Oliver Bow Aurm was right. 
The Asadi have a “language,” 

Stilly for all the go^ it does me 
they might as well have none. I 
continue to go through each day as 
if I were an amateur naturalist 
charting the activities of the in- 
habitants of my antfarm rather 
than a cultural xenologist at- 
tempting to find an ally against the 
monumental wilderness of space. 
One day is agonizingly like another. 
And I can’t blame my pariahhood, 
for the only things even a well- 
adjusted Asadi may participate in 
are sex and staring. It doesn’t pain

me overmuch to be outcast from 
participation in these. To some 
extent, I’m not much more of a 
pariah than any of these creatures. 
We’re all outcast from life’s feast, 
so to speak, with no bridge clubs, 
Saturday-night dances or home- 
study groups to enliven our lives. 

Unlike every other society I’ve 
ever seen or read about, the Asadi 
don’t even have any meaningful 
communal gatherings, any festivals 
of solidarity, any unique rituals of 
group consciousness. They don’t 
even have families. The individual 
is the basic unit of their “society.” 
What they have done, in fact, is to 
institutionalize the processes of 
alienation. Their dispersal at dusk 
simply translates into physical 
distance the incohesiveness by 
which they live during the day. And 
have we not learned over long 
centuries that such alienation is 
soul-destroying? How do the Asadi 
continue to live as a people? For 
that matter, why do they do so? 

But enough questions. As I men- 
tioned earlier, something out of the 
ordinary happened today. It hap- 
pened this afternoon. (It’s still hap- 
pening, 1 guess.) And although this 
occurrence poses more questions 
than it answers, it has rescued me 
from the vitiating sameness of 
Asadi daily life. As before, this 
strange event involves the old man 
who appeared in the clearing over a 
week ago. Him and with him, of 
course, the blind reptilian creature 
perched on his shoulder like a 
curse — the huri. 

Until today I’d never seen two 
Asadi eat together. As an 
Earthman from a western back- 
ground, I Find the practice of eating 



alone a disturbing one. Disturbing 
and depressing. After all. I’ve been 
eating alone for over three weeks 
now, and I long to sit down in the 
communal mess with Benedict and 
Eisen, Morrell and Jonathan, and 
everyone else at base camp. My 
training in strange folk ways and 
alien cultural patterns hasn’t 
weaned me away from this longing. 
As a result, I’ve watched with 
interest, and a complete lack of 
comprehension, the Asadi sitting 
apart from their fellows and pri- 
vately feeding — sucking on roots, 
chewing up leaves, and, as I 
reported a week ago, actually 
consuming the bark and heartwood 
of the trees. But doing so alone, 
apart, as a seemingly necessary 
exercise in isolation. 

Today this changed. 

At the beginning of the hour be- 
fore the fall of dusk, the old man 
staggered into the clearing under 
the burden of something damnably 
heavily. I was aware of the commo- 
tion at once. Like last time, every 
one of the Asadi fled from the floor 
of the assembly ground to the edge 
of the jungle. I observed from my 
lean-to. My heart, dear Ben, 
thrumped like a toad in ajar. I had 
wondered if the enigmatic old boy 
would ever return and now he was 
back. The huri on his shoulder 
scarcely moved — it appeared 

bloated and insentient, a rubber 
doll without a trace of life. During 
the whole of the old man’s visit it 
remained in this virtually comatose 
state, upright but unmoving. 

The aged Asudi (whom I’ve 
begun to regard as some sort of 
aloof and mysterious chieftain) 
paused in the center of the clearing. 



20 



IF 




looked about him and then strug- 
gled to remove the burden from his 
back. It was slung over his shoulder 
blades by means of two narrow 
straps. 

Straps, Eisen: S-T-R-A-P-S. 

Can you understand how I felt? 
Nor did the nature of the burden it- 
self cause my wonder to fade. For, 
you see, what the old man was 
lowering to the ground was the rich, 
brownish-red carcass of an animal. 
The meat glistened with the falling 
light of Denebola and its own 
internal vibrancy. The meat had 
been dressed, Eisen, it had been 
preapred and the old man was 
bringing it to the clearing as an of- 
fering to his people. 

He set the carcass on the dusty 
assembly floor and withdrew the 
straps from the incisions in the 
meat. Then he stood back five or 
six steps. Slowly a few of the adult 
males began to stalk back into the 
clearing. They approached the old 
man’s offering with diffident steps, 
like thieves in darkened rooms. I 
noticed that their eyes were fu- 
riously changing colors — they were 
speaking to one another with the 
urgency of a hundred electric kalei- 
doscopes. 

All but the old man who had 
brought the offering. I could see 
him standing away from the meat 
and his eyes — like unpainted china 
saucers — were the color of dull 
clay. 

His eyes didn’t alter even when 
several of the Asadi males fell upon 
the meat and began ripping away 
beautifully veined hunks, silently 
pushing and elbowing and clawing 
at one another. Then more and 
more of the Asadi males descended 



upon the carcass and all about the 
fringes of the clearing the females 
and the young made tentative 
movements out of the shadows. I 
had to leave my lean-to to see what 
was going on. And ultimately I 
couldn’t see anything but bodies 
and manes and animated discord. 

Before most of the Asadi were 
aware, Denebola had set. 

Awareness grew, beginning with 
the females and the young on the 
edges of the clearing and then 
burning inward like a grass fire. 
The first individuals to become 
aware flashed into the Wild. Others 
followed. Eventually, in a matter of 
only seconds, even the strongest 
males raised their bloody snouts to 
the sky and scented their predic- 
ament. Then they bounded toward 
the trees, disappearing in in- 
numerable directions — like the 
dying light itself. 

But here is the strange part. The 
old man didn’t follow his people 
back into the Synesthesia Wild. 

He’s sitting out there in the 
clearing right now. 

When all the Asadi had fled he 
found the precise spot where he had 
placed his offering, hunkered down, 
lowered his buttocks, crossed his 
legs, and assumed sole ownership of 
that sacred piece of stained ground. 
I can see hipi out there now, damn 
it. The moons of BoskVeld throw 
his shadow in three different direc- 
tions and the huri on his shoulder 
has begun to move a little, rustling 
its wings and nodding its blind 
head. 

This is the first night since 1 came 
here that 1 haven’t been alone and 
— I don’t like it. No, indeed, 
fellows, 1 don’t like it at all.

Personal involvenient: The Bachelor 

From the private notebooks of 
Egan Chaney: My meetings of The 
Bachelor, as I called him almost 
from the beginning, represented an 
unprecedented breakthrough. It 
came on my 29th day in the field — 
although, actually I had noticed 
him for the first time three days 
prior to his resolute approach and 
shy touching of my face. That 
touch, which I permitted solely out 
of respect for Mother Science, 
frightened me more than anything 
else that had happened to me in the 
Wild. As far removed from a threat 
as a woman’s kiss, that touch 
frightened me more than the first 
appearance of the old chieftain, 
more than the nightmare shape of 
the huri, more even than the chaos 
of rending and eating that followed 
the old man’s gift of the flame- 
bright carcass. I had been alone for 
weeks. Now, without much 
preamble, one of the Asadi had 
chosen to acknowledge my presence 
by touching me. Touching me! 

I must back up a bit. I must back 
up to the night that the Asadi 
chieftain, against all custom, stayed 
4n the clearing. My first realization 
that he intended to stay was 
another moment of minor terror. 
I’ll confess, but the implications of 
his remaining overrode my fear. 
Wakeful and attentive, I sat up to 
study his eveiy movement and to 
record anything that might con- 
ceivably be construed as significant. 

The old man didn’t move. The 
huri grew restive as the night 
progressed, but it didn’t leave the 
old man’s shoulder. The pair of 
them stayed in the clearing all that 
night and all the following day. 



They sat on the stained ground. 
When twilight came on that second 
day they departed with all the rest. 

1 despaired. How many days 
would I have to suffer through be- 
fore something else unusual oc- 
cured? Would 1 spend the next five 
months watching the Asadi engage 
in brutal sex and senseless staring 
matches? 

But on my 26th day on the edge 
of the clearing in the Synesthesia 
Wild, I saw The Bachelor. As far as 
I know I saw him for the first time. 
Certainly, if I had ever seen him be- 
fore I had paid no attention. This 
anomalous event again broke the 
tedium for me — even though I 
didn’t then fully understand what 
was happening. I knew only that 
the endless shuffling back and forth 
of the Asadi had given way momen- 
tarily to an instant of almost pure 
communion. 

The Bachelor was a completely 
unprepossessing specimen. 

I judged him to be three or four 
years beyond Asadi adolescence. 
Gray-fleshed and gaunt, he had a 
patchy silver-blue mane of so little 
length that the others surely 
considered him a virtual outcast. In 
fact, in all the time 1 knew him he 
never once took part in either coitus 
or the ritualized staring of the full- 
maned Asadi. When I first felt his 
eyes upon me The Bachelor was on 
my imaginary twenty-yard line, 
looking toward my lean-to from a 
pocket of his ceaselessly moving 
brethren. He had chosen me to 
stare at. The fact that he did not 
receive a cuffing for violating the 
one heretofore inviolable Asadi 
taboo confirmed for me the negligi- 
bility of his tribal status. It was he 



22 



IF 




and I who were brethren, not he 
and the creatures whom he geneti- 
cally resembled. 

But in one extremely salient par- 
ticular he didn’t resemble the vast 
majority of Asadi. His eyes; his 
hard, emotion-veiling eyes. These 
were exactly like the old 
chieftain’s — translucent but empty, 
enameled but colorless, fired in the 
oven of his mother’s womb but brit- 
tle like sun-baked clay. Never did 
The Bachelor’s eyes flash through 
the rainbow spectrum as did the^ 
prismatit: eyes of his comrades. 
They remained clayey and cold, a 
shade or two lighter than his flesh. 

And it was with these eyes, on my 
26th day in the field, that The 
Bachelor took my measure. The 
noonday heat held us in a shim- 
mering mirage, our gazes locked. 

“Well,” I shouted, “don’t just 
stand there making faces. Come 
over here where we can talk.” 

My voice had no effect on the 
teeming Asadi — it had no effect on 
The Bachelor. His posture un- 
changed, he regarded me with no 
more— and no less — interest than 
before. Of course, he could not 
“talk” with me. My human eyes 
don’t even have the virtuosity of 
traffic lights — and since The 
Bachelor’s never changed color, he 
couldn’t even communicate with his 
own kind. 

He was, for all intents and pur- 
poses, a mute. 

But when I called out to him, 1 
believed that his dead eyes indi- 
cated a complete lack of in- 
telligence. It did not then occur to 
me that they might be the external 
sign of a physical handicap, just as 
dumbness in human beings may be 



the result of diseased or paralyzed 
vocal cords. Instead I decided that 
The Bachelor was stupid. I’m still 
not entirely certain that this initial 
judgment was not correct. 

“Come on over here,” I said 
again. “It doesn’t bother me that 
you’re mentally deficient.” 

The Bachelor continued to stare. 
He didn’t approach. The distance 
between us measured almost thirty 
meters and occasionally a roving 
Asadi would intervene, its body 
blocking our vision. 

“Even if you had a thumbnail for 
a brain,” I mumbled, “you 
wouldn’t be at a terrible disad- 
vantage among this crew, old boy. I 
haven’t seen anyone but the old 
chieftain even attempt to test their 
intelligence. And untested in- 
telligence, like a cloistered virtue, 
isn’t worth a — ” I used an ancient 
and revered obscenity. The singing 
fronds of the Synesthesia Wild did 
not censure me for so saying. Some 
forty-odd light-years and^ a half- 
dozen or so centuries had invested 
the word with a mystic respecta- 
bility and I was too tired to be. more 
profane. 

The Bachelor didn’t respond to 
my inaudible cynicism. He stared at 
me for the rest of the afternoon. I 
tried to occupy myself with note- 
taking, then with a lunch of some of 
the rations Benedict had dropped 
and finally with cursory observa- 
tions of other Asadi. Anything to 
avoid that implacable gaze. It was 
almost a relief when dusk fell. But 
that evening my excitement grew 
and I realized that something 
monumental had happened — I had 
been acknowledged. 

The next day The Bachelor paid 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



23 




me little heed. He wandered 
forlornly in and out of the slow aim- 
less nies of his aimless kindred, a 
lanky gray clown unheeded by 
everyone but me. I was disap- 
pointed that The Bachelor did not 
demonstrate the same interest in 
me that he had shown the day be- 
fore. 

On the 28th day he resumed his 
shameless staring and I was 
gratified. He followed a procedure 
different from his stationary 
strategy of the first day — he moved 
tirelessly about the / clearing, 
weaving in and out of the clusters of 
Asadi, but always staying close 
enough to the western sideline to be 
able to see me. His eyes remained 
as dead as the insides of two oyster 
shells. 

I felt better the following 
morning, the morning of the 29th 
day — something was happening. 
The light from glowering Denebola 
seemed softer, the tropic heat less 
debilitating. 1 left my lean-to and 
went out on the assembly ground. 

Bathed in the pastel emptiness of 
dawn, I stood there as the Asadi 
came flying through the tendrils 
and fronds of the Synesthesia Wild 
to begin another day of Indifferent 
Togetherness. Their bodies broke 
through the green veils on the 
clearing's edge like a thousand 
swimmers diving into a spring and 
soon I was surrounded. Surrounded 
but ignored. Great ugly heads with 
silver or blue or clay-white or tawny 
manes bobbed around me, graceless 
and unsynchronized. And above us 
the sky of BoskVeld stretched out 
into the attenuated vastness of a 
universe infinitely less caring than 
even those dancing heads. 



The sun burned the morning 
away and at last I found The 
Bachelor. 

Undoubtedly he had had me in 
his sight all that morning — but, 
moving with circumspection among 
his fellows, he had not permitted 
me to see him. I had frett^ over his 
apparent absence. 

Then Denebola was directly 
overhead and The Bachelor 
threaded his way through a 
dissolving clump, of bodies and 
stopped not five yards from me, 
atremble with his own daring. I, 
too, trembled. I feared that at any 
moment The Bachelor would fall 
upon and devour me — instead he 
steeled himself to the task he had 
set and began his approach. I stood 
my ground. The gray head, the 
patchy silver-blue mane, the twin 
carapaces of his eyes — all moved 
toward me. Then the long gray arm 
rose toward my face and the 
humanoid hand touched the 
depression under my botton lip, 
touched the most recent of my 
shaving cuts, touched me without 
clumsiness or malice. 

And I winced. 

A ninniiig chronology: weeks pass 

Day 29: After achieving this 
unusual one-to-one contact with the 
Asadi native (hereafter referred to 
as The Bachelor) I did my best to 
And some method of meaningful 
communication. Nothing worked. 
Not words, of course. Not hand 
signals. Not signs in the dirt. Not 
even awkward charades. Never- 
theless, The Bachelor could 
not be dissuaded from following me 
about. Once when I left the clearing 
for lunch he very nearly followed 



24 



IF 




me into my lean-to. 1 was almost 
surprised when, at the fall of dusk, 
he left with the others— he had been 
so doggedly faithful all afternoon. 
Despite this desertion I’m excited 
about my work again. Tomorrow 
seems a hundred years off and I 
can’t believe that I ever thought 
seriously about scrapping the first 
painful returns from my presence 
here. 

Day 35: Nothing. Nothing at all. 
The Bachelor continues to follow 
me around, never any more than 
eight or nine paces away — his devo- 
tion is such that I can’t urinate 
without his standing guard at my 
back. He must think that he’s found 
an ally against the indifference of 
the others, but what his listless de- 
votion gains for either of us, I can’t 
say. All I know is that I’ve begun to 
tire of his attentions, just as he 
seems to have tired of the 
monotonous routine that he will 
not, for anything, abandon. Life 
in the clearing goes on as always. 
The others ignore us. 

Day 40: I am ill. The medicine 
Benedict dropped ine during an 
earlier bout with diarrhea is almost 
gone. It’s raining. As I write this. 
I’m lying on my pallet in njy lean-to 
^nd watching the Asadi slog back 
and forth across the floor of their 
assembly ground. The odor of their 
morose gray dampness assaults me 
lika a poison, intensifies my nausea. 
In and out the Asadi go, in and out 
and back and forth. 

I have formulated the interesting 
notion that their entire way of life^ 
in which I have had to struggle to 
see even one or two significant pat- 



terns, is itself the one significant 
and on-going ritual of their species. 
Formerly I had been looking for 
several minor rituals to help me ex- 
plain their society — it may be that 
they are the ritual. As the poet 
asked, “How tell the dancer from 
the dance?” But having formulated 
this new and brilliant hypothesis 
about the Asadi I’m still left with 
the question: iVhat is the signifi- 
cance of the ritual that the As^i 
themselves are? An existential 
query, of course. Maybe my illness 
has made me think this way. 
Maybe I’m going melodramatically 
insane. 

The Bachelor sits cross-legged in 
the dripping, steaip-silvered foliage 
about five yards from my lean-to. 
His mane clings to his skull and 
shoulders like so many tufts of mat- 
ted, cottony mold. Thought he’s 
been dogging my footsteps for 
eleven days now, I haven’t been 
able to induce him to enter this 
ramshackle shelter. He always sits 
outside and stares at me from be- 
neath an umbrella of shining 
fronds — even when it’s raining. As 
it is now. His reluctance to come 
under a manufactured roof may be 
significant. If only I could make the 
same sort 6f breakthrough with two 
or three others that I’ve made with 
The Bachelor. 

Day 46: A tinge of my illness re- 
mains. So does The Bachelor. The 
two have begun to get mixed up in 
my mind. Nothing else to report. 
In and out, in and out. Daybreak 
and sunset, sunset and daybreak. 
The Great Shuffle goes on. 

Day 5ft After the Asadi fled ipto 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI

the jungle last night, 1 trudged 
toward the supply pickup point 
where Benedict leaves my rations of 
food and medicine each week. The 
doses of Placenol that I’ve been 
giving myself lately, shooting up 
the stuff like a skidrow junkie 
(figuratively speaking, of course), 
have gotten bigger and bigger — but 
Eisen, at the outset of this farcical 
expedition, assured me that P-nol 
in any quantity is absolutely nonad- 
dictive. What amazes me beyond 
this sufficiently amazing attribute 
of the drug, however, is the fact that 
Benedict has been dropping more 
and more of it each week, providing 
me with a supply almost exactly 
commensurate with my increasing 
consumption. 

Or do I use more because they 
drop more? 

No, of course not. Everything 
goes into a computer at base camp. 
A program they ran weeks ago 
probably predicted this completely 
predicatable upsurge in my “emo- 
tional” dependency on P-nol. At 
any rate I’m feeling better. I’ve 
begun to function again. 

While I trudged, a haunting 
uneasiness seeped into me frpm the 
fluid shadows of the rubber trees. I 
heard noises. The noises persisted 
all the way to the drop point — faint, 
unidentifiable, frightening. Let me 
record this quickly: I believe that 
The Bachelor lurked somewhere 
beyond the wide leaves and trailing 
vines where those noises originated. 
Once, in fact, I think I saw his dull 
eyes reflect a little of the sheen of 
the evening’s first moon. But he 
never completely revealed himself 
to me — if, indeed, he was there at 
all. 



A typed note on the supply 
bundle: “Look, Chaney, you don’t 
have to insist on 100% nonassocia- 
tion with us. You’ve been gone al- 
most two months. A conversation 
or two with genuine hoo-man beans 
won’t destroy your " precious 
ethnography. Let us drop you a 
radio. You can use it in the 
evenings. If you want it, send up a 
flare tomorrow night before all 
three moons have risen and I’ll 
copter it out to the drop point the 
next day. So, how about it, Egan? 
Your Friend, Beneficent Ben.” 
But of course I don’t want a radio. 
Part of this business is the suf- 
fering. I knew that before 1 came 
out here. I won’t quit until things 
have at last begun to make a little 
sense. 

Day 57 (Pre-dawn): I haven’t 
been asleep all night. Yesterday 
evening, just six or seven hours ago, 

I went into the jungle to retrieve 
Benedict’s eighth supply drop. 
Another typed note on the bundle: 
“Chaney, you’re a pig-headed 
liinny. You don’t even know how to 
conjugate your own first name. It 
should have been Ego instead of’ 
Egan. I hope you’ve learned how to 
talk Asadi. If you haven’t I’m 
certain that you’ll have gone mad 
by now and started preaching 
neopentecostal sermons to the 
trees. What a picture. Send up a 
flare if you want anything. Ben.” I 
wouldn’t ’ve thought Ben quite so 
sardonically literate. 

On the way back to the clearing I 
heard noises again. The Synesthesia 
Wild echoed with the plunging 
gray ness of an indistinct form. I am 
certain (I think) that it was The 



26 



IF 




Bachelor spying on me, retreating 
clumsily before my pursuit. Yes, 
even with a backpack of new sup- 
plies weighting me down I de- 
termined to follow -these noises, 
these supicious tickings of leaf and 
twig. And although I never over- 
took my prey, I was able to keep 
up! It had to be The Bachelor, that 
half-seen grayness fleeing before 
me — none of his fellows would have 
permitted me so much as a glimpse 
of the disturbed foliage in the wake 
of their disappearance. I went 
deeper and deeper into the Wild, 
away from the assembly ground. 
Splotches of moonlight fled across 
the jungle with us. 

When, panting, I broke into an 
opening among the trees I all at 
once realized that the noises 
drawing me on had ceased. I was 
alone. Lost, maybe. But filling the 
clearing, rising against the sky like 
an Oriental pagoda, there loomed 
over me the broad and impervious 
mass of something built, something 
made. 

The resonances of Time dwarfed 
me. Thunderstruck, I felt panic 
climbing up the membranous lad- 
der in my throat. My own startled 
gasp startled me again. ,It*s hard 
to accept the fact that Vve seen 
what Vve seen. But that pagoda, 
temple, whatever, is actually out 
there! Old Oliver Bow Aurm 
studies the ruins of one of these 
structures — he learned only that the 
Asadi may have once had a civiliza- 
tion of some consequence. From 
this intact pagoda, however, 77/ un- 
doubtedly learn things that will 
eclipse even Frasiers discoveries. 
But God knows when Fll get out 
there again. .1 stared up at the 



lofty wings of this sudden artifact, 
then turned, plunged back into the 
jungle and raced wildly away, my 
backpack thumping. 

Where was I going? Back to the 
assembly ground. Which way to 
run? I didn't have to answer this 
question. Blindly I moved in the di- 
rection of the suspicious tickings of 
leaf and twig that had resumed 
shortly after I fled the pagoda. The 
Bachelor again? I don't know. I saw 
nothing. But in two hours' time I 
had regained the safety of my lean- 
to. Now I'm waiting for the 
dawn, for the tidal influx of Asadi. 

I'm exhilarated and I haven't 
even touched my new supply of Pla- 
cenol. 

Day 57 (Evening): They're gone 
again. But I've witnessed something 
important and unsettling. The 
Bachelor did not arrive this 
morning with the others. At least he 
didn't take up his customary 
position eight or nine paces behind 
me. That sort of peripatetic vigi- 
lance does not go unnoticed and 
this morning I missed it. Totally 
ignored, I wandered through the 
Asadi, looking for The Bachelor. 
He was nowhere among them. 
Could he have injured himself in 
our midnight chase through the 
Wild? 

By noon I was both exhausted 
and puzzled — exhausted by my 
search and my lack of sleep, puz- 
zled by The Bachelor's apparent de- . 
fection. I came to my lean-to and 
lay down. In a little while I had 
fallen asleep, though not soundly. 
Tickings of leaf and twig made my 
eyelids flicker. I dreamed that a 
gray shape came and squatted on 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



27 




the edge of the clearing about five 
yards from where I lay. Like a mute 
familiar, the shape watched over 
me. .. 

Kyur-AAAAACCCCCK! 

Groans and thrashings about. 
Thrashings and hackings. The un- 
derbrush beside my lean-to 
crackled beneath the invasion of 
several heavy feet. Bludgeoned out 
of my dream by these sounds, I sat 
up and attempted to reorient myself 
to the world. I saw The Bachelor. I 
saw three of the larger and more 
agile males bear him to the ground 
and pinion him there. They ap- 
peared to be cooperating in the task 
of subduing him! 

I watched their actions intently. 
What they did next confirmed my 
spur-of-the-moment evaluation. 
Cooperation it was indeed. The 
three males, who ignored me with 
all the contemptuous elan of 
aristocrats, picked up The Bachelor 
and bore him to the center of the 
clearing. I followed this party onto 
the assembly floor. As they had 
done during the old cheiftain's two 
unexpected visits, the Asadi 
crowded to the sidelines — but they 
did not disappear into the jungle. 
They remained on the field, buf- 
feting one another like the rabid 
spectators at one of those near- 
legendary “bowl” games. I was the 
only individual other than the four 
struggling males out in the center of 
the assembly floor. I looked down 
at The Bachelor. His eyes came 
very close to changing colors, going 
from their usual clay-white to a 
thin, thin yellow. But I couldn't in- 
terfere.- 

They shaved his mane. A female 
carrying two flat, beveled stones 



came out of the crowd on the 
eastern perimeter of the field — she 
gave the stones to the males. With 
them the males scraped away the 
last sad mangy tufts of The 
Bachelor's silver-blue collar. Just as 
they were about to finish, he gave a 
perfunctory kick that momentarily 
dislodged one of his tormentors, 
then acquiesced in his shame and 
lay on his back staring at Denebola. 
The entire operation had taken only 
about ten minutes. The three males 
sauntered off from their victim — 
and the satisfied spectators, aware 
that the barbering was over, 
strolled liesurely and with all their 
former randomness back into the 
clearing. Now, of course, they 
ignored The Bachelor with a 
frigidity they had once reserved for 
me. 

I stood in the center of the 
clearing waiting for The Bachelor 
to get to his feet, the two of us a 
blurred focal point on the slowly 
revolving wheel of the Asadi Dance 
of Indifference. But for a long time 
he didn’t move. His narrow head, 
completely shorn, scarred by their 
barbering stones (the first tools I 
had seen any of them but the 
chieftain employ), looked un- 
naturally fragile. 

I leaned down and offered him 
my hand. A passing Asadi jostled 
me. Accidentally, I think. The 
Bachelor rolled to his stomach, 
rolled again to avoid being stepped 
on, curled into the foetal position — 
then unexpectedly sprang out of the 
dust and dodged through a broken 
file of his uncaring kinsmen. Did he 
wish to attain the edge of the Wild? 
Intervening bodies blocked my view 
of him, but I suppose he disap- 



28 



IF 




peared into the trees and kept on 
running. 

All extremely interesting, of 
course. What does it signify? My 
hypothesis this evening is that the 
Asadi have punished The Bachelor 
for leading me last night, whether 
he did so inadvertently or on pur- 
pose, to the ancient pagoda in the 
Synesthesia Wild. His late arrival 
in the clearing may have been an in- 
genuous attempt to forestall this 
punishment. I can’t think of any 
-other reasons why the Asadi should 
have moved to make him even more 
of an outcast than he already was. 

All this ambivalence mystifies 
me. It also convinces me that I 
can’t permit the monotony of nine- 
tenths of their “daily life” to 
becloud my eyes to the underlying 
meaning of it all. Patience, dear 
God, is nine-tenths of cultural xe- 
nology. And the punishment of 
weariness (since I’m discussing 
punishments, cruel and otherwise) 
runs concurrently with the xe- 
nologist’s term of patience. Con- 
sequently and/or hence. I’m going 
to bed. 

Day 61: The Bachelor has not 
returned. Knowing that he’s now 
officially a pariah, he chooses to be 
one on his own terms. During his 
absence I’ve been thinking about 
two things: 1) If the Asadi did in 
fact punish The Bachelor because 
he led me to the pagoda, then they 
realize full well that I am not 
simply a maneless outcast. They 
know that I’m genetically different, 
a creature from elsewhere, and they 
consciously wish me to remain ig- 
norant of their past. 2) I would like 
to make an expedition to the pa- 



goda. With a little perserverence it 
shouldn’t be exceedingly difficult to 
find, especially since I plan to go 
during the day. Unusual things hap- 
pen so rarely in the Asadi clearing 
that I can afford to be gone from it 
for a little while. One day’s absence 
should not leave any irreparable 
gaps in my ethnography. If the 
expedition goes well that absence 
may provide some heady insights 
into the ritual of Asadi life. 

I wish only that The Bachelor 
would return. 

Day 63: Since today was the day 
of Benedict’s ninth scheduled drop I 
decided to make my expedition into 
the Wild early this morning. I 
would be “killing two birds,” as 
Ben himself might well put it. First: 
1 would search for the lost pagoda. 
Second: if I failed to find it I would 
salvage some part of the day by 
picking up my new supplies. 
Therefore, before dawn, off I went. 

The directional instincts of 
human beings must have died 
milliennia ago — I got lost. The 
Wild stirred with an inhuman and 
gothic calm that tattered the thin 
fabric of my resourcefulness. 

Late in the afternoon Benedict’s 
helicopter saved me. It made a 
series of stuttering circles over the 
roof of the jungle — at one point I 
looked up and saw its undercar- 
riage hanging so close to the tree 
tops that a spy monkey might have 
been able to leap aboard. I followed 
the noise of the helicopter to our 
drop point. From there I had no 
trouble getting back to the clearing. 

Today, then, marks the first day 
since I’ve been in the Wild that I’ve 
not seen a single member of the 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



29 




Asadi. I miss The Bachelor as 1 
would miss a prodigal child. I await 
each dawn with newly rekindled ex- 
pectations. But the entire night lies 
before me and the only way to get 
through it is to sleep. 

Day 68: Even though I could not 
justify an excursion on the basis of 
another drop (the next one is still 
two days away), I went looking for 
the pagoda again. The last four 
days have teen informational 
zeroes. I had to get away from the 
clearing, had to take some kind of 
positive action, no matter how 
foolish that action might seem. And 
it was passing foolish — I got lost 
again, terrifyingly so. Green 
creepers coiled about me — the sky 
disappeared. And this time I knew 
that Benedict’s helicopter would 
not fly overhead — not unless I 
could wait another two days for it. 
How, then, dear diary, did our hero 
get home? Once again, the suspi- 
cious tickings of leaf and twig. I 
simply followed them. Now I’m 
back in my lean-to again, confident 
that The Bachelor is still out there 
and steadfast in my decision to 
make no more expeditions until I 
have help. 

Day 71: The Bachelor is back! 

Day 72: Yesterday I could record 
nothing but the simple fact of the 
Bachelor’s appearance in the 
clearing. This evening I’ll note only 
three or four concomitant facts. 
The Bachelor still has very little 
mane to speak of and the Asadi 
treat him as a total outcast. These 
last two days he has demonstrated a 
considerable degree of inde- 



pendence in his relations with me. 
He continues to follow me about, 
but less conspicuously and with oc- 
casional side trips that remove him 
altogether from my sight. He no 
longer hunkers beside my lean-to at. 
all. A made dwelling-place may put 
him uncomfortably in mind of the 
pagoda to which he led me and for 
whose discovery to an outsider he 
was publicly humiliated. I find this 
new arrangement a felicitous one, 
however. A little privacy is good for 
the soul. 

Day 85: The note on yesterday’s 
supply bundle: “Send up a flare 
tomorrow night if you wish to re- 
main in the Wild. Eisen is seriously 
considering hauling you out of 
there. Only a flare will save you. 
The flare will mean, ‘I’m learning 
things. Don’t remove me from my 
work.’ No flare will mean either 
that your stay has stopped being 
profitable or that you’ve reached 
your limit. My personal suggestion, 
Egan, is that you do nothing, just 
sit tight and wait for us. Okay? 
Your friend, Ben.” I’ve just sent up 
two goddamn flaries. Day 85 will go 
down in cultural-xenological his- 
tory as Egan Chaney’s personal 
Fourth of July. 

Day 98: I’m holding my own 
again. Thirty days ago I made my 
second excursion into the Wild to 
find the elusive pagoda. I’ve 
survived almost an entire month 
without venturing away from the 
assembly ground. 

Most of my time in the clearing 
has been devoted to noting indi- 
vidual differences among the Asadi 
natives. Since their behavior for the 



30 



IF 




most part manifests a bewildering 
uniformity I’ve necessarily turned 
to the observation of their physical 
characteristics. Even in this area, 
however, most differences are more 
apparent than real — I’ve found few 
useful discriminators. Size has 
some importance. 

The ability of the eyes to flash 
through the spectrum is another 
discriminator of sorts. But the only 
Asadi who don’t possess this ability 
in a complete degree are the old 
chieftain and The Bachelor. 

Nevertheless, I can now recog- 
nize on sight several Asadi other 
than these prominent two. I’ve tried 
to give descriptive names to these 
recognizable individuals. The 
smallest adult male in the clearing I 
call Turnbull, because his stature 
puts me in mind of Colin Turnbull’s 
account of the pygmies of the Ituri. 
A nervous fellow with active hands 
I call Benjy, after Benedict. The old 
chieftain continues to exert a 
powerful influence on my thinking. 
His name I derived by simple 
analogy. Him I call Eisen Zwei. 

The Bachelor now seems intent 
on retaining his anonymity — his 
mane has grown very little since the 
shaving. I would almost swear that 
he plucks it at night in the Wild, 
keeping it short on purpose. Who is 
to say? These last few days he’s 
avoided even me; that is, after he 
ascertains my whereabouts in the 
morning and then again in the 
evening, as if this simple knowledge 
suffices to maintain him secure all 
day and then through the un- 
certainty of night on BoskVeld. The 
bloom, I suppose, has gone off our 
romance. Good. We’re both more 
comfortable. 



Today was another drop day. I 
didn’t go out to retrieve my parcels. 
Too weary, too bloodless. But I’ve 
sworn off Placenol and the at- 
tendant psychological lift has made 
my physical weakness bearable. My 
parcels will be out there tomorrow. 

Tonight I’m going to read Ode- 
gaard’s official report on the Sham- 
blers of Misery. And then sleep. 
Sleep sleep sleep. 

Day 106: Eisen Zwei, the old 
chieftain, came back today! In 
thumbing through this notebook I 
find that I first saw him enter the 
clearing exactly ninety days ago. 
Has a pattern begun to emerge? If 
so, I can’t interpret its periodicity. I 
don’t even know, come to think of 
it, what sort of life span the Asadi 
have. It might be that a man would 
have to stay out here centuries in 
order to unravel a mere sleeve of 
the garment of their existence. God 
forbid. 

This visit of Eisen Zwei — to 
return to the issue at hand — 
proceeded in a manner identical to 
that of his first one. He came into 
the clearing with the huri on his 
shoulder, sat down, remained 
perhaps an hour, then stalked back 
into the Wild. The Asadi, of course, 
fled from him — motivated, per- 
haps, more by loathing than fear. 

How long will I have to wait until 
ole E.Z. returns? 

Day 1 10: The behavior of the 
Asadi — all of the Asadi — has un- 
dergone a very subtle alteration, 
one I can’t account for. Nothing in 
my previous association with them 
gives me a basis for evaluating its 
import. Even after 1 10 days in the 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



31 




field I’m a slave to purely human 
concepts of causality — behavior 
changes for certain reasons, not 
from mere whim. But out here 
reasons elude me in the same way 
that the Asadi pagoda, about which 
I now only dream, once eluded me. 

Let me state what I have ob- 
served. For the last two days every 
member of this insane species has 
taken great pains to avoid stepping 
into a rather large area in the center 
of the clearing. As a result the 
Asadi have crowded themselves 
into two arbitrary groups at op- 
posite ends of the field. These 
“teams” do not comport 
themselves in exactly the same way 
as did the formerly continuous 
group. Individuals on both sides of 
the silently agreed-upon No Man’s 
Land exude an air of heightened 
nervousness. They crane their heads 
about, clutch their arms across 
their chests, sway, suffer near- 
epileptic paroxysms as they weave 
in and out, in and out, among their 
fellows. Watching them I some- 
times believe that they writhe to the 
music of an eerie flute played deep 
in the recesses of the jungle. 

Sometimes staring matches will 
take place between individuals on 
opposite sides of the imaginary 
chasm. Eyes change color, bodies 
bend and limbs flail. But neither 
participant puts a foot inside the 
crucial ring of separation, which is 
about thirty yards long and al- 
most — but not quite — the entire 
width of the clearing. Not quite, 
mind you, because there’s a narrow 
strip of ground on each sideline 
through which the two “teams” 
may exchange members, one 
member at a time. These exchanges 



occur infrequently, with a lone 
Asadi darting nervously out of his 
own group, down one of , these un- 
marked causeways and into the 
“enemy” camp. Why do they avoid * 
the center of the clearing? The only , 
reason my Earthman’s mind can 
settle on is that the clearing’s center i 
marks that area of fearsome 
ground where an offender has been 
humiliated, blood spilled and flesh 
consumed. But all these things hap- 
pened a good while ago. Why this 
fastidiousness now? Why this sepa- 
ration? 

The Bachelor has reacted to it all 
by climbing into the branches of a 
thick-boled tree not ten meters 
from my lean-to. From dawn to 
sunset he sits high above his ins- 
crutable kinsmen, watching, 
sleeping, hvaybe attempting to 
assess the general mood. At times 
he looks in my direction to see what 
I make of these new developments. 

I don’t make much of them. 

Day 1 12: It continues, this 
strange bipartite waltz. The dancers 
have grown even more frantic in 
their movements. Anxiety pulses in 
the air like electricity. The Bachelor 
climbs higher into his tree, strug- 
gling to the topmost branches 
where his hold is precarious — he 
wedges himself in place. In the last 
three days I can’t recall having seen 
any of the dancers eat — none have 
engaged in sex. Even their staring 
contests have virtually ceased, 
though those that do occur are 
, fierce and protracted. The 
nonexistent flute that plays in my 
head has grown stingingly shrill and 
1 cannot guess what the end of this 
madness must be.

IF 




Day 114: Events culminated 
today in a series of bizarre develop- 
ments that pose me a conundrum of 
the first order. What will happen 
tomorrow? I can’t imagine any sort 
of follow-up to what I raptly 
watched today. 

It began early. Eisen Zwei came 
into the clearing an hour after the 
arrival of the Asadi. As on his 
second visit, he bore on his back the 
dressed-out carcass of an animal. 
His huri, though once again upright 
oh the old man’s shoulder, looked 
like the work of a rather inept 
taxidermist — lopsided, awkwardly 
posed and inanimate. The people in 
the clearing deserted their two 
identically restive groups, fleeing to 
the jungle around the assembly 
ground. 1 could not help thinking, 
Hom; strange, how ironic, that the 
force that momentarily reunifies 
the Asadi is a shared loathing. 

The Bachelor, half-hidden by 
great lacquered leaves and unsteady 
in the fragile upper branches, 
leaned out over the clearing’s edge 
and gazed down from his empty 
clay-white eyes. I clutched the bole 
of his tree, surrounded now by the 
curious, loathing-filled Asadi who 
had crowded into the jungle. They 
ignored me. Unaware of him, they 
ignored The Bachelor^ too — but 
together we all watched the 
spectacle proceeding in the Center 
Ring. 

Eisen Zwei lowered the burden 
from his back. He undid the straps 
that had held the meat in place. But 
now, instead of stepping away and 
permitting a few of the braver 
males to advance, he took the near- 
unconscious huri from his shoulder 
and set it upon the bleeding lump of 



meat. The huri’s blind head did not 
move, but even from where I stood 
I could see its tiny fingers rippling 
with slow but well-orchestrated 
malice. Then this hypnotic rippling 
ceased and the huri sat there 
looking bloated and dead, a 
plaything for the children of sca- 
brous witches. 

Without a farewell of any sort 
Eisen Zwei turned and stalked back 
into the Synesthesia Wild. Where 
he left the clearing, foliage clattered 
from the efforts of several Asadi to 
get out of his way. 

Silence fell again. 

And now no one left the security 
of the assembly ground’s edge to 
challenge the huri’s ownership of 
this new and sorely tempting 
carcass — despite the fact that I had 
not seen any of the Asadi take food 
in almost five days. 

Denebola, fat and mocking, 
crossed a small arc of the sky and 
made haloes dance in a hundred 
inaccessible grottos of the Wild. 

An hour passed, and Eisen Zwei 
returned! He had simply left the 
huri to guard his first offering. Yes, 
fir§t. For the old chieftain had come 
back with still another carcass 
slung across his bony shoulders, 
another dressed-out and flesh- 
strapped carcass. He set it down 
beside the other. The huri animated 
itself just long enough to shift its 
weight and straddle the two con- 
tiguous pieces of meat. Then the old 
Asadi departed again, just as be- 
fore. 

In an hour he returned with a 
third piece of meat — but this time 
he entered the clearing from the 
west, about twenty yards up from 
my lean-to. I realiz^ that he had 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



33 




first entered from the east, then 
from the south. A pattern is 
developing, I thought. Now hell 
depart once more and reenter from 
the north. After all, even the most 
primitive peoples on Earth had as- 
cribed mystical characteristics to 
the four points of the compass and I 
was excited by the prospect of my 
being able to draw a meaningful 
analogy. 

Of course, Eisen Zwei saw fit to 
shatter my hopes by remaining on 
the assembly floor— he did not 
leave again at all. (In fact, as on my 
22nd night in the Wild, he still has 
not left. Under a triangle of copper- 
green moons the old chieftain and 
his huri squat on the bleak, blood- 
dampened ground waiting for 
Denebola’s first spiderwebbings of 
light.) He made one complete cir- 
cuit around the clearing instead, 
walking counterclockwise from his 
point of entrance. The huri did not 
move. 

This done, Eisen Zwei rejoined 
his noxious familiar at midfield. 

Here the second stage of this new 
and puzzling ritual began. Without 
taking the third carcass from his 
back, E.Z. bent and picked up the 
huri and put it in its accustomed 
place on his shoulder. Kneeling, he 
tied straps through the two pieces 
of meat over which the huri had 
kept watch. Next he began to drag 
these marbled chunks of brown and 
red slowly through the dirt. He 
dragged the first into the southern 
half of the clearing and set the huri 
down once more as his guardian. 
This procedure he duplicated in the 
northern half of the clearing, except 
that here he himself stoc^ guard 
over the second offering. The final 



carcass he still bore on his back. 

Outlined in the dust were two dis- 
tinct drag marks, inward-looping 
circles that delineated the 
chieftain's progress from the 
original resting place of the meat. 
The coil in the dust of the northern 
half of the field was single; that in 
the southern, double. The Asadi 
tensed. 

Eisen Zwei stepped away from 
the second offering. Deep in his 
throat he made a noise that 
sounded like a human being, a 
grown man, trying to fight down a 
sob. This sound, I suppose I should 
add, is the first and so far the only 
example of voiced communi- 
cation-discounting involuntary 
groans and a few guttural, growl- 
like mumblings — that I’ve heard 
among the Asadi. The huri 
responded to Eisen Zwei’s plaintive 
“sobs”— -undoubtedly a signal — by 
hopping, practically falling, off the 
object of its guardianship and then 
scrabbling miserably through the 
dust toward its master. Its rubbery 
wings dipped, twisted, folded upon 
themselves. (I’ve almost decided 
that the huri is incapable of flight, 
that its wings represent an ana- 
tomical holdover from an earlier 
stage of its evolution.) When both 
Eisen Zwei and his wretched huri 
had reached their sacred patch of 
ground at midfield the old Asadi 
picked up the beast and let it close 
its tiny hands over his discolored 
mane. 

The two of them held everyone’s 
attention. 

Then the wizened old chieftain 
extended his arms, tilted back his 
head and, staring directly at the 



/

IF 




sun, made a shuddering inhalation 
of such piteous depth that 1 thought 
either his lungs would burst or his 
heart break. The clearing echoed 
with his sob. 

At once the Asadi poured out of 
their hiding places onto the 
assembly ground— not simply the 
adult males, but individuals of 
every sex and age. Even now, 
however, in the middle of this 
lunging riot, the population of the 
clearing divided into two groups, 
each one scrimmaging furiously, in- 
tramurally, in its own cramped plot 
of earth. Teeth flashed, manes 
tossed, bodies crumpled, eyes pin- 
wheeled with inarticulate color. The 
hunger of the Asadi, like mid-Au- 
gust thunder, made low sad music 
over the Wild. 

In this hunger neither The 
Bachelor nor I shared. We merely 
watched, he from aloft, I from the 
trembling shadows. 

It did not take long for the Asadi, 
slashing at one another and some- 
times half-maiming themselves, to 
devour the two carcasses. Perhaps 
five minutes. Like piranhas, 1 
thought, quick, voracious, brutal. 

And then Eisen Zwei inhaled his 
grief-shot moan and the confusion 
ceased. Every lean gray snout 
turned toward him. The dying went 
off to die alone, if any were in fact 
at the point of death. I saw no one 
depart, but neither did 1 see anyone 
prostrate in the dirt — as unlikely as 
it may sound. (Death, like birth, the 
Asadi must choose to experience in 
the intimate privacy of the jungle 
and the night — in my months here 
I’ve not seen a single tribesman die 
in the clearing. Illness, accident and 
age apparently have no sting here. 



And, believe it or not, Tve only just 
now realized this. Does it mean 
anything? Sure. (But what?) All 
eyes upon him, silence steaming out 
of the very earth, Eisen Zwei made 
preparations for the third and final 
act of today’s unanticipated, unex- 
pectedly baroque ritual. 

He lowered the burden from his 
back, sat down beside it and — in 
full view of his benumbed 
tribesman — ate. The creature on 
his shoulder leaned into his mane 
and I thought that the old chief 
might feed the huri, give it some- 
thing for its contribution to the 
festivities. He gave it nothing. Inert 
but clinging, the huri did not 
protest this oversight. 

An hour passed. Then two. Then 
three. 

By this time I had long since 
retired to the shade of my lean-to, 
emerging at fairly frequent inter- 
vals to check the goings-on in the 
clearing. By the second hour the 
Asadi had begun to move about 
within their separate territories. By 
the third hour these territories had 
merged so that I could no longer 
distinguish the two distinct 
“teams” of previous days. The pat- 
tern of the Daily Life of my first 
109 days in the clearing had 
reassert^ itself — except that now 
the Asadi moved with incredible 
sluggishness, suspiciously regarding 
their chieftain and refusing to en- 
croach upon a rather large un- 
marked circle containing him. 

I decided that the ritual was 
about to conclude. Out among the 
Asadi, trying to feel through my 
pores the prevailing mood, 1 no- 
ticed that The Bachelor had come 
down out of his tree. But I didn't 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



35 




see him in the clearing. All I saw 
was old E.Z., isolated by a 
revolving barricade of legs, chewing 
with an expression of stupid pen- 
siveness. The huri flapped once or 
twice as the afternoon progressed, 
but the old chieftain still did not 
fe^ it. 

Finally, sunset. 

The Asadi fled, dispersing as they 
always have — but Eisen Zwei, no 
doubt as surfeited as a python that 
has just unhinged its lower jaw to 
admit a fawn, slumped in his place 
and did not move. 

Now three alien moons dance in 
the sky and I’m left with one 
question, the one question that I’m 
frightened to ask, so stark and self- 
evident is its answer: From what 
sort of creature did the old chief ob- 
tain and dress out his ritual of- 
ferings? Once before I didn’t ask 
this question at all — I couldn’t ask 
it. But now, huddled beneath the 
most insubstantial of roofs, I am 
unable to fend off the terrible rami- 
flcations of the Asadi way of death. 

Speculations on cannibalisni: an 
extemporaneous essay 

From the unedited in-the-field 
tapes of Egan Chaney: It’s a beau- 
tiful day. Just listen. Let me hold 
the microphone out for you — hear 
that? Nothing but a thousand pairs 
of feet (minus six or eight feet, 1 
suppose) slogging back and forth 
through a quarter inch of hot dust. 
Nothing but that and the soulful 
respiration of the Asadi and — 
somewhere beyond these scarcely 
tangible sounds — the stillness of all 
Bosk Veld. A beautiful day, just 
beautiful. 

And here I am, your roving 



reporter, Egan Chaney, right out 
here where the action is, thoroughly 
prepared to give you the latest and 
most comprehensive coverage of 
each new development in the 
clearing. Unfortunately, Eisen, I 
still do more waiting around than 
adrenelin-powered summaries of 
the on-going news. It’s four days 
since your counterpart, Eisen Zwei, 
stirred things up with his disorderly 
three-course banquet. 

Since then, nothing. 

As a consequence. I’m now going 
to switch hats, doffing my cor- 
respondent’s chapeau in favor of 
the dignified visor of a senior news 
editor. I’m walking. I’m walking 
among the Asadi. They fail to see 
me even though I’m just as solid, 
just as real, as they are. Even the 
ones I’ve given names to refuse to 
grant me the fact of my existence. 

I’ve just walked by Werner. The 
configuration of his features gives 
him a gentle look, like that of a 
Quaker wearing a parka. His 
seeming gentleness leads me to the 
topic of this commentary — how 
could a creature of Werner’s mien 
and disposition actually eat the 
flesh of one of his own kind? God 
help me if these aliens are sentient, 
my good base-camp buggers, be- 
cause. I’m walking among canni- 
bals! 

They encircle me. They ensorcel 
me. They fill me with a sudden 
dread, an awe such as the awe of 
one’s parents that consumes the 
child who has just learned the secret 
of his own conception and birth. 
Exactly thus, my dread of the 
Asadi, my awe of their intimate 
lives.

complete section of Egan Chaneys 
otherwise unfinished ethnography: 

PART ONE— DEATH. On Day 120 the 
old chieftain, whom I called Eisen 
Zwei, took ill. Because it had 
been several days since he had 
gorged himself during the “feast,” 
I then supposed that his sickness 
was not related to his earlier 
intemperance. I am still oT this 
mind. For five days he had e^ten 
nothing, although the rest of the 
Asadi refused to observe his fast 
and began eating whatever herbs, 
roots, flowers, bark and heartwood 
they could find— just as they had 
done before their ritual feast. They 
ignored the old chief and the old 
chiefs huri, much in the way they 
ignored The Bachelor and me.** 

Eisen Zwei's sickness altered the 
pattern^ altered it more violently 
than had his several appearances in 
the clearing. On the afternoon of 
the first day of his illness he 
abruptly rose from his reserved 
center plot and made the horribly 
glottal, in-sucking noises that he 
had used to summon his people to 
the meat six days before. 

I came running from my lean-to. 

The Asadi moved away from the 
old chieftain, stopped their shuf- 
fling and shambling and stared 
from great platterlike eyes, the 
lenses of which had stalled on a 
single color. This delicate stasis 
reigned for only a moment. Then 



♦♦Several explanatory footnotes were pro- 
vided with the publish^ fragment. I wrote 
the introduction to the fragment, and the 
footnotes that foUow this one are all from 
my hand. Thomas Benedict. 



the in-sucking noises were replaced 
by a spastic rumbling. As 1 broke 
into the clearing I saw the old man 
bent over at the waist, his arms 
above his head, heaving and again 
heaving until it seemed that he 
would soon be vomiting into the 
dust the very lining of his bowels. 1 
turned away, abashed by the sight, 
but since the Asadi stared on, fas- 
cinated, I turned back around to 
observe their culture in action. It 
was at that moment, if at no other, 
that I earned the Oliver Bow Aurm 
Frasier Memorial Fillet, which the 
Academy has since bestowed upon 
me.*** 

The chieftain’s huri flew up from 
his shoulder and flapped in the 
somnolent air like a small wind- 
collapsed umbrella. I had never 
seen it fly before — I was surprised 
that it was capable of flight. Its un- 
gainly flapping excited the already 
well-aroused population of the 
assembly ground, and together we 
watched the huri rise above tree 
level, circle back over the clearing, 
and dip threateningly toward the 
brar.ches of the trees on the 
clearing’s western edge. The old 
chief and his vehement, body- 
wracking convulsions seemed for- 
gotten. Every pair of color-stalled 
eyes followed the uncertain aerial 
progress of the huri. It plummeted, 
noisily flapping, toward that 
precariously forked perch where

The Bachelor sometimes se- 
questered himself. 

But The Bachelor was not there, I 
did not know where he was. 

The huri crashed downward 
through the branches, caught itself 
up, struggled flapping out of the 
jungle and returned with blind de- 
votion to the air space over its 
master. I thought that at last it was 
going to feed, that its sole diet 
might well consist of Eisen Zwei’s 
vomitings. 1 expected the starved 
creature to fall upon these — but it 
did not. Somehow it kept itself 
aloft, flapping— flapping— waiting 
for the old man to finish. 

And when the old chief had com- 
pletely emptied himself and fallen 
exhausted to his knees, it was not 
the huri that waded into the vile 
pool of vomit but the old man’s 
shameless compatriots. 

Now I did not even think of 
returning to my lean-to. My 
curiosity overcame my revulsion 
and I watched the Asadi carry away 
the half-digested mass as if each 
semi-solid piece were an invaluable 
relic. There was no fighting, no el- 
bowing, no eye-searing abuse. Each 
individual simply picked out his 
relic, took it a short distance into 
the jungle and deposited it in some 
hidden place for safe-keeping. 

All during this solemn recessional 
the huri quickened the air with its 
heavy wings and an anonymous 
Asadi supported Eisen Zwei by ten- 
derly clutching the old chiefs 
mane. When everyone had taken 
away a chunk of regurgitated flesh 
the chieftain’s attendant laid him 
down out of the sphere of hallowed 
spew, and the huri descended to 
squat by its master’s head. This 



newest ritual was over, all over. 

I should mention, however, that 
The Bachelor appeared in the 
mourning throng to select and de- 
part with some memento of Eisen 
Zwei’s illness, just as the others 
had. He came last, took only a 
palm-sized morsel and retreated to 
the clearing’s edge. Here he 
climbed into the tree above which 
the huri had flown its nearly disas- 
trous mission only minutes before. 
Until sunset The Bachelor re- 
mained here, observing and 
waiting — as I, as a cultural xe- 
nologist, must always do. 

On Days 121, 122 and 123 Eisen 
Zwei continued in his illness and 
the Asadi paid him scant attention, 
their chief ministrations consisting 
of bringing him water twice a day 
and refraining from stepping on 
him. The huri sat by the old 
chieftain’s head. It shifted from one 
foot to the other and waited — 
smugly, I thought — for its master 
to die. It never ate. 

At night the Asadi deserted their 
dying leader without a glance, 
without a twinge of doubt, and I 
was afraid that he would die while 
they were gone. Several times, 
looking out at his inert silhouette, 
moonlight dripping through the 
fronds, I thought he had died, and a 
mild panic assailed me. Did 1 have 
a responsibility to the corpse? Only 
the responsibility, I decided, to let it 
lie and observe the reactions of the 
Asadi when they came back at 
dawn. 

But the old chief did not die 
during any of these nights and on 
Day 124 another change occurred. 
Eisen Zwei sat up and stared at 
Denebola as it crossed the sky — but 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI

he stared at the angry sun through 
the spread fingers of both his hands, 
hands he crooked into claws and 
tore impotently through the blur of 
light that Denebola must have 
seemed to him. The huri did not 
move. As always, it sat smug and 
blindly knowing. But the Asadi no- 
ticed the change in their leader and 
reacted to it. As if his writhing 
dissatisfaction with the sun were a 
clue, they divided into two groups 
again and formed attentive semi- 
circles to the north and south of 
Eisen Zwei. They watched his 
challenge to the sun, his wrestling 
with its livid corona, his tearing at 
its indistinct streamers of gas with 
gnarled hands. 

At noon the old chief rose to his 
feet. He stretched out his arms. 
Sobbing, he clawed at the sky, sud- 
denly gave up and sank back to his 
knees. 

Without any sort of visible 
prompting a pair of Asadi from 
each group went to his aid. They 
lifted him from the ground. Others 
on the clearing’s edge selected 
large, lacquered fronds from the 
rubber trees and passed these over 
the heads of their comrades to the 
place where their leader had 
collapsed. The men supporting 
Eisen Zwei took these fronds, ar- 
ranged them into a regal pallet and 
then placed the fragile body on the 
bed they had made. 

For only the second time that I 
could remember the Asadi had 
cooperated to bring about a desired 
end. (The other occasion, of course, 
had been the shaving of The 
Bachelor’s mane.) But, like ancient 
papyrus exposed to the air, their 
cooperation disintegrated as soon 



as Eisen Zwei was stretched full- 
length on his pallet. 

Each of the groups maintained a 
semblance of its former integrity, 
but aimless shambling replac^ 
chieftain-watching as the primary 
activity within each group. Dene- 
bola, finally free of the old man’s 
gaze, fell toward the horizon. 

I walked unimpeded through the 
clearing and bent down over the 
dying chieftain, careful to avoid the 
huri that watched me from its un- 
canny, socketless face. I shrugged 
off the creature’s literally blank 
stare and looked into the genuine 
eyes of its master. 

I experienced a shock, a physical 
jolt. 

The old man’s eyes were burned 
out, blackened holes in a humanoid 
mask. It now made little difference 
that even before his staring match 
with the sun his eyes had not 
possessed the Asadi ability to run 
through the spectrum — for now, 
burned out, blackened, they were 
utterly dead, two char-smoked 
lenses waiting for the old man’s 
body to catch up with their life- 
lessness. 

And then the diffused red light 
that signaled sunset in this forested 
region of BoskVeld was pouring 
through the Wild. 

The clearing emptied. 

Alone with Eisen Zwei and his 
huri, I knew that it would be during 
this night that the old man died. I 
tried to find some intimation of life 
in his blackened eyes, saw none and 
withdrew to the cover of the Wild 
and the security of my lean-to. I did 
not sleep. But my worst premoni- 
tions betrayed me and in the 
morning I looked out to see Eisen 



40 



IF 




Zwei sitting cross-legged on his 
pallet, the huri once again perched 
on his shoulder. 

And then the tenuous yellow light 
that marked sunrise and reju- 
venation on BoskVeld filtered 
through the jungle. 

The Asadi returned, filled the 
clearing with their lank bodies and 
once again took up their positions 
to the north and the south of the 
dying chieftain. 

Day 125 had begun. 

And, finally, the ritual that I had 
decided the Asadi were resolved it- 
self into a lesser ritual in which they 
merely participated — the grandest, 
strangest, and most highly ordered 
ceremony in their culture. I call the 
events of Day 125, taken as a cumu- 
lative whole, the Ritual of Death 
and Designation. I believe that we 
will never fully understand the nar- 
rowly “political” life of the Asadi 
until we can interpret, with 
precision, every aspect of this 
ritual. Somewhere in the context 
of the events of Day 125 lies the 
meaning of it all. And how terrible 
to be confronted with an elusive 
truth! 

The color of the eyes of every 
Asadi in the clearing (The 
Bachelor’s excepted) declined into a 
deep and melancholy indigo. And 
stalled there. The effect of solemn 
uniformity struck me as soon as I 
stepped onto the assembly floor — 
even though I had intended to look 
first at Eisen Zwei and not at his 
mourners. Profound indigo and 
absolute silence. So deeply 
absorbent were the eyes of the 
Asadi that Denebola, rising, could 
cast no glare, could throw out not a 
single dancing, shimmering, un- 



capturable ray. Or so it seemed. 
The day was an impressionist 
painting rendered in flat pastels and 
dull primaries — a paradox. 

Then the heads in which the in- 
digo eyes so intriguingly reposed 
began to rock from side to side, the 
chin of each Asadi inscribing a 
small figure eight in the air. The 
heads moved in unison. This went 
on for an hour or more as the old 
chieftain, as blind as his com- 
panion, sat cross-legged on his 
pallet, nodding, nodding in the 
monumental morning stillness. 

Then, as if they had inscribed 
figure eight’s for the requisite pe- 
riod, the Asadi broke out of their 
separate groups and formed several 
concentric rings around the old 
man. They did so to the same 
lugubrious rhythm that they had es- 
tablished with their chins; they 
dragged their long bodies into 
place. The members of each ring 
continued to sway. The inaudible 
flute which I had once believed to 
be in the Wild had now certainly 
been exchanged for an inaudible 
bassoon. Ponderously, the Asadi 
swayed. Ponderously, their great 
manes undulated with a slow and 
beautifully orchestrated grief. And 
The Bachelor (all by himself, just 
beyond the outermost ring) swayed 
also in cadence with the others. 

Now I was the sole outcast 
among this people, for I alone ob- 
served and did not participate. 

The rhythmic swaying lasted 
through the remaining hours of the 
forenoon and on toward the ap- 
proach of evening. 

I retired to my lean-to, but 
thought better of just siUing there 
and climbed the tree in which The 



death and DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



41 




Bachelor often perched. I forgot 
about everything but the weird 
ceremony in the clearing. I did not 
eat. I did not desert my station. 
Neither did I worry about my sepa- 
ration from the members of the 
Third Denebolan Expedition in 
base camp — it was for this 
moment, I instinctively understood, 
that I had refused any but the most 
essential contacts with other human 
beings. Leaning out over the 
clearing I gave myself up com- 
pletely tp the hypnotic movements 
of the shaggy-headed players that a 
generous universe had permitted 
me to study. No, thank merciful 
God, Egan Chaney had not been 
born too late. 

I nodded but I did not sleep. 

Suddenly Eisen Zwei gave a final 
sob, maniacal and heartrending, 
and grabbed the beast that clung 
with evil tenacity to his mane. He 
seized it with both palsied hands. 
(This was near the end of the day — 
I could feel the last dull rays of 
Denebola caressing my back, 
covering me like a threadbare 
blanket, unevenly warm.) Eisen 
Zwei exerted himself to what 
seemed his last reserve of strength 
and, strangling the huri, lurched out 
of the dust to his feet. The huri flap- 
ped, twisted, freed one wing and 
flapped harder. The old chief 
squeezed his hands together and at- 
tempted to grind the life out of the 
creature. He was not successful. 
The huri beat the air with its wings, 
beat the chieftain about the face 
and finally used its tiny hands to 
scour fine crimson wounds in Eisen 
Zwei’s withered cheeks and buckled 
forehead. 

During this struggle the Asadi 



stopped swaying, they looked on 
with eyes that gradually fell away 
from indigo toward a paler blue. 
Eisen Zwei drew a deep breath and 
shook the belligerent huri back and 
forth, up and down, like a bar- 
tender mixing a exotic drink. 

But the huri flapped out of his 
grasp and rose to tree level. I feared 
that it would dive upon me in my 
borrowed perch, but it skirted the 
inside perimeter of the clearing — 
dipping, banking, silently cawing. 
Its imaginary screams replaced the 
distant but just as imaginary 
bassoon in my consciousness. 
Meanwhile Eisen Zwei, finding his 
hands empty, relaxed and dropped 
back onto his pallet. His body fell 
across it sideways, and his burned- 
out eyes fixed themselves — coinci- 
dentally, Fm sure — on me. 

The Asadi chieftain was dead. He 
died just at sunset. 

I waited for his people to flee into 
the Wild, to leave his brittle corpse 
in the clearing for an Earthman’s 
astonished scrutiny. They did not 
flee. Even though the lethal twilight 
was gathering about them, they 
stayed. The attraction of the old 
one’s death outweighed their fear of 
exposing themselves in an open 
place to the mysteries of darkness. 

In my arboreal lookout I realized 
that I had witnessed two things I 
had never before seen among the 
Asadi: Death and a universal 

failure to repair. What would the 
night bring? The featureless, un- 
predictable night? 

PART TWO: DESIGNATION The 

Ritual of Death and Designation 
had passed into its second major 
stage before I truly comprehended 



42 



IF 




that stages existed. I ignored my 
hunger. 1 put away the thought of 
sleep. 

As I did so the Asadi converged 
upon the old man's corpse and 
those of smallest size were permit- 
ted to crowd into the center of the 
clearing and lift the dead chieftain 
above their heads. The young, the 
deformed, the weak, and the conge- 
nitally slight of stature formed a 
double column beneath the old 
man’s outstretched body and began 
moving with him toward the 
northern endzone. 

Arranged in this fashion, they 
forced a startling revelation upon 
me — these were the Asadi whose 
manes were a similar color and 
texture, a stringy detergent-scum 
beige. But they bore the corpse of 
Eisen Zwei with uncomplaining ac- 
quiescence. The larger, sleeker 
specimens of Asadi (those with 
luxuriant silver, silver-blue, or 
golden manes) formed single 
columns on each side of their 
lackluster counterparts and 
together these two units, like water 
inside a moving pipe, flowed 
toward the north — 

— the one direction that Eisen 
Zwei had not entered from on the 
day he brought those three dressed- 
out, provocative carcasses into the 
clearing. 

I recalled that driver ants in 
Africa had used just this sort of 
tubular alignment when they 
wished to move great distances as a 
group, the workers inside the 
column, the warriors without. And 
nothing on that immense dark 
continent was more feared than 
driver ants on the march — with, of 
course, the exception of man. 



Almost too late I realized that 
the Asadi would be out of the 
clearing and beyond my reach 
unless I got out of The Bachelor’s 
tree. Nearly falling, 1 scrambled 
down. The twilight glittered with 
the dust of the departing cojumns, 
and the foliage through which the 
mourners marched gave off a soft 
gauzy glow, as if viewed through a 
photographer’s filter. I ran. I found 
that I could keep up with very little 
effort, so cadenced and funereal 
was the step of their procession. I 
slowed to a walk behind it. 

Trudging in the wake of the 
mourners, incorrigibly hangdog in 
his pariahhood, was The Bachelor. 
As the huge gray procession snaked 
into the Synesthesia Wild, I noted 
that the circumstances of this 
march had reversed our roles — now 
I was following him. Three or four 
steps behind it all, Egan Chaney — 
the consummate outsider ri- 
diculously hoping to learn the door- 
opening arcana of a group that had 
excluded him. 

And all the while the twilight glit- 
tered, thickened, reverberated with 
the footfalls and leaf nudgings of a 
thousand single-minded communi- 
cants. 

Before we had got completely out 
of the clearing, I looked around for 
the huri. I saw it flying above that 
part of the procession where its 
master was being borne forward on 
the shoulders of the smaller Asadi. 
Avoiding branches, the huri turned 
an inadvertent cartwheel in the air, 
righted itself and landed on Eisen 
Zwei’s bony chest. Here, conspic- 
uous above the heads of its 
master’s people, it did a little’ 
preening dance. It looked like an 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



43 




oil-coated rooster wooing a hen. 

Then the column snaked to the 
left. The Wild closed off my view of 
the marchers and darkness began 
drifting in like black confetti. 

I dogged The Bachelor's foot- 
steps and waited for a new reve- 
lation. 

How long we trudged through the 
singing fronds, the perfumed 
creepers, the blades of blue air, I 
don’t know. Nor will I attempt to 
estimate. 

There in the clearing, rising 
against the sky like an oriental pa- 
goda, loomed the broad and imper- 
vious mass of something built, 
something made. By now all three 
moons were up and the solid black 
bulk of this structure was spot- 
lighted in the antique-gold claret 
that the three moons together shed. 
Even before those of us at the end 
of the procession were out of the 
jungle, we could see the lofty, 
gemlike wings of this sudden arti- 
fact — and I may not have been the 
only one whose first inclination was 
to flee, to plunge back into the 
nightmare forest. 

As we approached, members of 
both the inner and the outer 
columns began to sway from side to 
side, marching and swaying at 
once. The Bachelor’s head, in fact, 
moved in wide arcs and his whole 
marching body trembled as if from 
the paroxysms of ague. If he had 
been punished for leading me to this 
place, perhaps he trembled now 
from fear. On the other hand, if the 
Asadi wished this temple kept in- 
violate, wouldn’t they somehow 
punish me once they discovered my 
presence? 

I did have the good sense to get 



out of the way. I climbed a tree on 
the edge of the clearing that fronted 
the pagoda. From this vantage 
point I watched the proceedings in 
relative safety. 

Gray forms moved in the deep 
shadow that the Asadi temple cast. 
Suddenly two violently green 
flames burned in the iron flambeaus 
on either side of the top step of the 
immense tier of stone steps that led 
to the temple’s ornate doorway. 
The two torchlighters — formerly 
the moving gray forms — came back 
down the steps. Never before had I 
seen the Asadi make use of fire — 
this sophisticated use both of flam- 
beaus and a starting agent that I 
could not even guess at destroyed a 
multitude of my previous conclu- 
sions about them. Meanwhile the 
four columns of Asadi had ranged 
themselves in parallel files before 
the stairway of the ancient pagoda 
and six beige-maned menials bore 
the corpse of Eisen Zwei, now an 
uncanny apple-green in the torch- 
light, up the broad stone steps to 
the stone catafalque before the 
door. Here they set the corpse down 
and lined up behind it, staring 
out over theit waiting kinsmen, 
facing the cruel ambivalence of the 
Wild, three on each side of the old 
man. I was not accustomed to such 
spectacle, such tawdry grandeur, 
and I began to think that perhaps 
Placenol did flow in my veins — Pla- 
cenol or something more sinister. 

The moons cried out with their 
silent mouths. The flambeaus ut- 
tered quick screamings of unsteady 
light. 

But the ritual did not conclude. 
The night drew on — the moons 
rolled and the four files of Asadi 



44 



IF 




tribesmen shuffled in their places. 
They pulled at their manes. They 
looked up at the leaf-fringed sky. 
They looked down at their feet. 
Some stretched out their hands and 
fought with the tumbling moons 
just as Eisen Zwei had wrestled 
with Denebola, the sun. But none 
left the clearing, though I felt many 
would have lik^ to. 

Instead, wrestling with their own 
fears, they waited. The pagoda and 
the corpse of their chieftain com- 
manded them — while 1, wedged like 
a spike into my tree, was com- 
manded by their awesome patience. 
Then the last of the three moons fell 
into the farthest jungle of Bosk- 
Veld. The two iron torches guttered 
like spent candles. The Bachelor 
fidgeted. 

Two vacuums existed. One, the 
vacuum in nature between the end 
of night and the beginning of day. 
The other, the vacuum in the pe- 
culiar hierarchy of the Asadi tribal 
structure, the vacuum that Eisen 
Zwei had so oddly filled — until his 
struggle with the sun and his sub- 
sequent death. Night and death. 
Two vacuums in search of com- 
pensatory substance. 

Up in the air, clinging to two 
willowy tree branches, I made cur- 
sory mental notes in regard to this 
undoubtedly significant parallel- 
ism. When would dawn break? 
How would the Asadi designate 
their dead chieftain’s successor? 

A commotion in the clearing 
interrupted these transcendent 
speculations. Looking down, I saw 
that the four neat files of Asadi had 
dissolved into a single disorganized 
mass of milling bodies — as on their 
original assembly ground. A chaos. 



An anarchy. A riot of unharnessed 
irrationality. How could a vacuum 
of “leadership” exist in such an ar- 
bitrary melange of unrelated parts? 
Only the pag^a had solidity; only 
the pagoda did not move. 

Then, looking up, I saw the old 
man’s huri floating high above this 
disorder, floating rather than 
flailing, a gyrfalcon rather than a 
pelican. It rode the prismatic, pre- 
dawn breezes with uncommon 
grace and skied off so effortlessly 
that in a moment it had dwindled to 
a scrap of light, picking up some 
predawn reflection, far beyond the 
temple’s central spire. 

Watching it, I grew dizzy. 

Then the huri folded its wings be- 
hind it and plummeted down, diz- 
zyingly down, through the roseate 
sky. I almost fell. My feet slipped 
through the fork that had supported 
me and I was left dangling, arms 
above my head, over one edge of 
the pagoda’s front yard. The 
anxiety-torn communicants were 
too caught up in their panic to 
notice me. 

Meanwhile the huri rocketed 
earthward. 

It dived into the helpless crowd of 
Asadi and skimmed along their 
heads and shoulders with its cruel, 
serrated wings. Dipping in and out, 
the huri once again flapped Hke a 
torn window shade — all its 
ephemeral grace was gone, turned 
to crass exhibitionism (I don’t 
know what else to call it) and un- 
wieldy flutterings. But the creature 
did what it sought to do, for in that 
predawn dimness 1 could see that it 
had scarred the faces of several of 
the Asadi. 

Nevertheless, a few of the 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



45 




tribesmen tried to capture the 
huri— while, more reasonably, 
others ducked out of its way, fell to 
the ground, clutched their knees, 
crawled between the scrambling 
legs, or threw up their arms to ward 
it off. The huri did not discriminate. 
It scarred all of those who got in the 
way of its bladed ^ngs, whether 
they attempted to catch it or to flee. 
And the eyes of the harassed Asadi 
flashed through their individual 
spectrums. The heat from so many 
changes made the clearing phos- 
phorescent with shed energy. 

I caught sight of The Bachelor 
and saw that his eyes had not 
changed. They were still mute, de- 
void of all intellect or passion. He 
stood apart from his panicked 
comrades and observed, neither 
grappling for nor fleeing from the 
huri. As for the noxious beast, it 
flew up, flew down, peformed wob- 
bly banking movements, and 
slashed with its terrible pinions at 
everything living. Finally it shot up 
through the shadow of the pagoda, 
wildly flapping, then pitched over 
and dived upon The Bachelor. It 
flew into his face. It drove him to 
the ground and battered him with 
countless malicious thrashings. 

To the last individual the Asadi 
quieted, queued up randomly and 
watched this unpredictable de- 
nouement, the penultimate act in 
their day-long ritual. It took me a 
moment to understand. Then I 
realized: 

The Bachelor was the designee, 
the chosen one, the chieftain elect. 
Somehow it seemed an inevitable 
choice. 

My arms aching, 1 dropped from 
the tree onto the floor of the 



clearing. In front of me were the 
backs of twenty or thirty Asadi. I 
could not see The Bachelor at all, 
though I could still hear the 
churning of the huri's wings and the 
newly modulated breathing of the 
tribesmen. Then a figure, insanely 
rampant, flailing its arms, 
disrupted the smooth surface of the 
crowd and darted through a quickly 
closing gap of bodies to my right. I 
knew that The Bachelor had 
regained his feet and was trying to 
fight off the huri. The two of them 
thrashed their way up the tier of 
steps in front of the temple and 
soon were on the paving beside the 
catafalque where Eisen Zwei still 
rested. 

Now I could see as well as 
anyone, and there on that sacred, 
high place The Bachelor capitu- 
lated to the inevitable. 

He went down on his knees, 
lowered his head, and ceased to 
resist. The huri, sensing its victory, 
made an air-pummeling circuit over 
the body of the dead chieftain. It 
sawed devilishly at the faces of the 
corpse-bearers and rippled like dry 
brown paper. Then it settled on The 
Bachelor’s head. Beating its wings 
for balance, it faced the onlooking 
multitude of Asadi — and me — with 
blind triumph. 

No one moved, no one breathed, 
no one acknowledgecLthe dawn as it 
revealed the caustic verdigris 
coating the pagoda like an evil 
frost — like the rime on the forehead 
of antiquity. 

Slowly, after a moment twice as 
ponderous as the pagoda’s an- 
tiquity, The Bachelor rose to his 
feet. He was draped in his own 
resignation and the invisible garb of 



46 



IF 




an isolation even more pronounced 
than that he had suffered as an 
outcast. 

He was the designee, the chosen 
one, the chieftain elect. 

The huri dropp^ from The 
Bachelor’s head to his shoulder and 
entwined its tiny fingers in the tufts 
of his butchered mane. There it 
clung, once again inanimate and 
scabrous. 

Now the Ritual of Death and 
Designation was nearly over and 
two of the corpse-bearers on that 
highest tier moved to complete it. 
They touched the head and the feet 
of Eisen Zwei with the tips of the 
two great flambeaus, and instantly 
the old man’s body raged with 
green fire. The raging flame leaped 
up the face of the temple as if to 
abet the verdigris in its patient ef- 
forts to eat the building away. The 
Bachelor stood almost in the very 
blast of this conflagration and I 
feared that he, too, would be 
consumed. But he was not. Nor was 
the huri. The fire died, Eisen Zwei 
had utterly disappeared and the 
corpse-bearers came back down the 
steps and joined the anonymity of 
their revitalized people. 

The Ritual of Death and Desig- 
nation had ended. 

For the purposes of this ethnog- 
raphy I will minimize the signfi- 
cance of what then occurred and 
report it as briefly as I am able. 

Several of the Asadi turned and 
saw me in the pagoda’s clearing. 
They actually looked at me. After 
having been ignored for over six 
months I did not know how to react 
to the signal honor of abrupt visi- 
bleness. Out of monumental sur- 
prise I returned their stares. They 



began advancing upon me, hostility 
evident in the rapid blurring of 
colors that took place in their eyes. 
Behind me, the Synesthesia Wild. 1 
turned to escape into its vegetation. 
Another small group of Asadi had 
insinuated themselves into the path 
of ‘my intended escape — they 
blocked my way. 

Among this group I recognized 
the individusil whom I had given the 
name Benjy. Cognizant of nothing 
but a vague paternal feeling toward 
him, I sought to offer him my hand. 
His own nervous hand shot out and 
cuffed me on the ear. I fell. Dirt in 
my mouth, gray faces descending 
toward me, I understood that I 
ought to be terrified. But I spat out 
the dirt — the faces and manes 
retreated as quickly as they had 
come and my incipient terror 
evaporated like alcohol in a shallow 
dish. 

Overhead, a familiar flapping. 

I looked up and saw the huri as it 
returned to The Bachelor’s 
outstretched arm. He had released 
the creature upon his fellows in 
order to save me. This simple 
action, however, illustrates the 
mind-boggling complexity of the 
relationship between the Asadi 
chieftain and his huri. Which of 
them rules? Which submits to com- 
mand? 1 

At that moment I didn’t very 
much care. Denebola had riseu and 
the Asadi had dispersed into the 
Wild leaving me dwarfed and 
humble in the presence of their 
crumbling pagoda and the reluctant 
chieftain who stared down from its 
uppermost tier. Although he re- 
mained aloof, before the day was 
out The Bachelor had led me back 



death and designation among the asadi 



47 




to the original assembly ground — 
for I would have never found it on 
my own. 

The admittedly banal lesson that 
I learned from this experience, 
members of the Academy, is that 
even for a cultural xenologist — 
perhaps especially for a cultural xe- 
nologist — it pays to make friends. 

Thomas Benedict speaking: a 
brief interpolative note 

I have put this paper together out 
of a simple sense of duty. As one of 
the few people Egan Chaney 
permitted to get close to him, I am 
perhaps the only man who could 
have undertaken this task. The 
section you have just read — The 
Ritual of Death and Designation— 
Chaney wrote in our base-camp in- 
firmary while recuperating from ex- 
posure and a general inability to 
reorient himself to the society of 
human beings. In one of our con- 
versations he compared himself to 
Gulliver after his return from the 
land of the Houyhnhnms. At any 
rate, beyond Death and Desig- 
nation Chaney never wrote 
anything about the Asadi for publi- 
cation, although immediately after 
his release from the infirmary / 
believe he intended to begin a book 
about them. 

As Vve already said, then, I un- 
dertook this compilation of dis- 
parate notes out of a sense of duty, 
a two-fold duty: the first to Egan 
Chaney, who was my friend — the 
second to the vast numbers of 
concerned humanity who wish to 
understand our neighbors on other 
worlds in order better to under- 
stand themselves, Chaney s failure 
need not be our own. 



Upon his return to the original , 
assembly ground of the Asadi after 
the Ritual of Death and Desig- 
nation, Chaney stayed two more 
weeks in the Synesthesia Wild. On 
Days 126 and 133 I made supply 
drops, but, just as Chaney had 
requested, did not fly over the 
clearing in the vain hope of spotting 
him and thereby determining the 
state of his health. It was enough, 
he told me, to verify his robustness 
from the fact that each week when I 
coptered in his supplies I could note 
that not a scrap of paper from the 
previous shipment littered the drop 
point. The argument that he was 
not the only creature in the Wild 
capable of hauling away the goods 
intended for him impressed Chaney 
not at all. 

'7 might as well be,** he wrote on 
one of his infrequent notes left in a 
canister at the drop point. "The 
Asadi have all the initiative of ma- 
laria victims. More horrible than 
this, friend Ben, is the face-slapping 
truth that there is no one else in the 
Wild — no one else at all!** 

I am now the sole owner of the 
personal effects of Egan Chaney; 
these include both his private and 
professional journals, a number of 
unfiled "official** reports, a series 
of in-the-field tapes and a small bit 
of correspondence (alluded to in an 
early footnote). Those records con- 
cerning the Asadi that I dont own 
myself, I have access to as a result 
of my association with the Third 
Denebolan Expedition. / tell you 
this only because I know for an in- 
controvertible facf that during his 
last fourteen days in the Wild, 
either Chaney did not make a single 
entry in any of his journals or 



48 



IF 




notebooks or he so completely ef- 
faced these dubious entries from 
our material realm that they may as 
well never have existed. 

We have only one complete 
report of any kind in regard to these 
last two weeks. It is a tape, a re- 
markable tape, and I believe that 
Chaney would have destroyed it, 
too, had we not taken his recorder 
from him the instant we picked him 
out of the jungle. 

I have listened to this tape many 
times — in its entirety, / should add, 
since doing so is a feat which few 
other men would have the patience 
for. Once / attempted to discuss the 
tape with Chaney (this was several 
days after his release from the in- 
firmary, when I believed that he 
could handle the terror of the ex- 
perience with a degree of ob- 
jectivity), but he protested that I 
had imagined the contents. He said 
that he had never recorded the least 
word in the tape's running jiccount 
of The Bachelors ** — metamor- 
phosis?" he asked. "Is that the 
word you used?" 

I promptly played the tape for 
him. He listened to ten minutes of 
it, then got up and shut it off. His 
face had gone unaccountably lean 
and bewildered. His hands 
trembled. 

"Oh, that," he said, not looking 
at me. "That was all a joke. I made 
it up because there was nothing bet- 
ter to do." 

"The sound-effects, too?" I asked 
incredulously. 

Not looking at me, he nodded — 
even though the circumstance of his 
pickup belied this clumsy expla- 
nation, exploded it, in fact, into un- 
tenable shrapnel. Chaney remained 



mute on this subject. In all of his 
writings and conversations in those 
last three months among us he 
never mentioned or even alluded to 
the sordid adventure of his final two 
nights. I present here a transcript, 
somewhat edited, of the tape in 
question. This final virtuoso section 
of our colloboration, our patch- 
work ethnography that I call . 



Chaney^s monologue: two nights 
in The Synesthesia WOd ^ 

Hello all! What day is it? A day 
like any other day, except YOU 
ARE HERE! Here with me, that 
is. I’m leading you on an expedi- 
tion . But forgive my initial lie — 
it isn’t a day like any other day at 
all. How often do 1 lead you on 
expeditions? 

It’s Day 138, I think, and 
yesterday The Bachelor returned to 
the clearing — the first time he’s 
been back since the day the huri 
anointed him, so to speak, with the 
fecal salve of chieftainship. I’d al- 
most given him up. But he came 
back into the clearing yesterday 
afternoon, the huri on his shoulder, 
and squatted in the center of the 
assembly ground just as old Eisen 
Zwei used to do. The reaction 
among his Asadi brethren was 
identical to the one they always 
reserved for E.Z. Everybody OUT 
of the clearing! Everybody OUT! It 
was old times again, gang, except 
that now the actor holding down 
center stage was a personal friend 
of mine — who, by the by, had saved 
my life several times. Yes, sir. 

After the heat, the bor^om, and 
eight or a hundred sticky rain- 
falls — my lean-to leaking like a 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



49 




colander — I couldn’t have been 
more gratified. 

Following the pattern old E.Z. 
established on one of his visits, The 
Bachelor spent the entire afternoon 
in the clearing, all of last night and 
maybe an hour or so this morning. 
Then he got up to leave. 

I’ve been following him ever 
since. By the sun it’s about noon. 

Yes, The Bachelor permits me to 
follow him. Moreover, it’s easy. As 
ou can tell I’m not even breathing 
ard. I’m recording as we walk. If 
this were a terrestrial wood, you 
could hear birdsong and the chit- 
terings of insects. As it is, you’ll 
have to content yourselves with the 
sounds of my footfalls and the rus* 
tlings of leaf and twig. Here’s a 
little rustle for you now. 

(The sound of a branch or 
leaf snapping back. General 
background noises of wind and, 
far less audibly, distant running 
water, } 

The Bachelor is several yards ahead 
of me but you may not be able to 
hear him — he walks like a stealthy 
animal. Pad pad pad. Like that, 
only softer. I don’t care to be any 
closer than I am because the huri’s 
riding The Bachelor’s shoulder, 
clinging to his mane. It is not a win- 
some creature, base campers — no, 
indeed it’s not. Since it hasn’t any 
eyes you can’t tell whether it’s 
sleeping — or awake and plotting a 
thousand villainies. 

That’s why I’m happy back here. 

Let me impress you with my 
cleverness. {A heavy thump,) That’s 
my backpack. I’ve brought provi- 
sions for three or four days. You 



see, I don’t know where we’re going 
or how long we’ll be there. But in 
The Bachelor I trust. Up to a point, 
at least. My cleverness, though, 
doesn’t consist solely of hauling 
along some supplies. The backpack 
also houses my recorder, Morrell’s 
miniaturized affair, the one that has 
a tape capacity of 240 hours, or, as 
Benedict would phrase it, ten solid 
days of Chaney’s uninterrupted bla- 
thering. 

I’ve rigged it so that my voice will 
trigger the recording mechanism 
whenever I speak and so that the 
absence of my voice for a ten- 
minute period automatically shuts 
it off. That’s to conserve recording 
time — not that I plan on talking for 
ten straight days — and to keep me 
from fiddling with buttons when 
there might be other things to do. 
Of course, I can always go manual 
if I have to, countermanding the ex- 
clusive lock on my own voice, but 
so far none of the Asadi have been 
particularly voluble. Only Eisen 
Zwei. And his voice would not be 
apt to woo the ladies. Ergo, I’m 
once again your reporter in the 
field, your objective observer, your 
unbiased eyes. 

I’ve been thinking. Yes, I have, 
too. And what I wouldn’t give for a 
copy of one of the ancient works 
that no one reads any more — The 
Brothers Karamazov, Surely The 
Bachelor is none other than the 
Asadi equivalent of Pavel Smerd- 
yakov, the illigitimate son who 
destroys himself out of his in- 
nate inability to reconcile the spir- 
itual and the intellectual in his na- 
ture. Such passionate despondency! 
He cannot escape, nor accept, 
the dictum that the individual

is responsible for the sins of 
all. .♦♦♦♦ 

1 CHANEY (whispering): It’s quiet 
in here, as still as the void. And 
though you probably can’t believe 
it, I’ve held my peace for an entire 
afternoon. Maybe I said, “Damn!” 
two or three times after scraping 
my shin or tripping over a partially 
exposed root — but that’s all. In 
here I scarcely feel that it’s kosher 
to talk, to raise my voice even to 
this hoarse whisper. 

(Chaney clears his throat. 
There is an echo, a hollow 
sound which fades. } 

We — the three of us — are inside 
the pagoda, in front of which The 
Bachelor t^came the designated 
“leader” of his people. I feel free to 
talk only because he and the huri 
have gone up a narrow iron 
stairway inside this pyramidal 
structure toward the ceiling — 
toward the small open dome from 
which the exterior spire rises. I can 
see them from here. The stairway 
spirals up and The Bachelor climbs 
it. The huri — no kidding. I’m not 
kidding at all — flies up through the 
center of the spiral, staying even 
with The Bachelor’s head, but I 
can’t — absolutely can’t — hear its 
wings flapping. 

In this place, that’s strange. But 



♦♦♦♦There follows a totally irrelevant 
analysis of the ways in which The Bachelor 
resembles the .baracter of Smerdyakov in 
Dostoyevski’s novel. To spare the reader 
Tve deleted it. 1 believe that the passage 
which follows was recorded approximately 
six hours later. 



it’s preternaturally cold in here — 
maybe the cold has something to do 
with it — cold and dead, like no 
building ever erected in a tropical 
rain forest. No, damn it, even my 
whispers echo. 

It’s nearly dark outside. At least 
it was nearly dark twenty minutes 
ago when we came in through the 
heavy doors that the Asadi — two 
weeks past — didn’t even open. Now 
the moons must be up. Maybe a lit- 
tle moonlight falls through the 
dome overhead . No, no, 
Chaney — the light in here comes 
from those three massive globes in^ 
the metal ring suspended several 
feet below the dome. The 
Bachelor’s climbing toward that 
huge ring, the stairway rises toward 
it, it looks like a spartan chandelier, 
the globes like white-glowing dead- 
flesh lamps . Listen. Listen to the 
light fall... 

i There is no sound for several 
minutes, perhtws a slight am- 
plification of Chaney s breath- 
ing. Then his voice descends 
conspiratorially. ) 

Eisen, Eisen, another paradox for 
you physics majors. 1 think — I 
don’t know, mind you, but I think 
that both the chill and the lu- 
minosity in here originate — ema- 
nate, so to speak — from those 
globes up there. It’s just a feeling I 
have. Winter sunlight. The texture 
of the luminosity in here reminds 
me of the glow around probeship 
ALERT and EVACUATE- signs, a 
deadly sort of lambence. Just listen. 
Hear that livid glow, that livid hell- 
sheen? All right, let’s move to 
where we can see.

ing. Footfalls echoing hol- 
lowly off polished stone. } 



Pm looking straight up the well 
of the stairway. {An echo: Way way 
,way way . .) C’mon, Egan, keep it 
down, keep it down . better, 
much better. I can see the huri 
flapping up there noiselessly — The 
Bachelor’s legs ascending the 
spiral. The staircase seems to ter- 
minate in a glass platform off to 
one side and just a little below the 
suspended ring of the “chandelier.” 
The Bachelor is ascending to this 
platform — there’s nowhere else he 
can go. I’m looking up through the 
axis of the dome, right up through 
the chandelier ring. 

Outside, above the dome, is a 
spire pointing up at BoskVeld’s 
sky. Inside the dome, depending 
from its apex, there’s a sort of 
plumbline — of what looks like 
braided gold — that drops down the 
central shaft of the pagoda to a 
point . .just about a foot above the 
suspended ring. A foot, I think. 
Can’t tell for certain. Been in the 
jungle so long my depth per- 
ception’s shot — just as the Ituri 
pygmies used to have trouble 
adjusting vision to open savannah. 

I apologize for the complicated 
description of the upper recesses of 
this temple, but the arrangement is 
intricate and that’s where The 
Bachelor’s going. I can make sense 
neither of the architecture nor of his 
intentions . And my neck’s get- 
ting sore, tilted back. 

2 CHANEY {conversationally, but 
still in something of a whisper): Me 
again. The Bachelor reached the 



glass platform beneath the chan- 
delier ring about an hour ago. 
He’s been standing up there like a 
Pan-Olympic diver ever since, 
except that he’s looking — as far 
as I can tell — at the braided gold 
plumbline that hangs slightly above 
him from the temple’s dome. He 
can’t quite reach it from the plat- 
form he’s on. Would he like to? 1 
don’t know ... no, he can’t reach it. 
Not without a trapeze, daringly, 
could he reach that gilded pen- 
dulum. And then, what for? 

As the channel announcers on the 
telecom operas would say, “Let’s 
leave Billy Bachelor high atop the 
Callisto Medcenter, lamenting the 
lost Lenore, and follow E. G. Chan- 
wick as he goes spelunking through 
the mysterious satellite’s caverns of 
steel in his ongoing, bi-weekly 
endeavor to unravel the Secret of 
the Universe.” 

( Unsuccessfully stifled snick- 
ers. Resultant echoes. Foot- 
falls.) 

I’ll be your tour guide, base 
campers. Follow me. This pagoda 
seems to be a museum. Or a mauso- 
leum perhaps. At any rate, a 
monument to a dead culture. The 
walls around three sides of the bot- 
tom of this place are lined with tall 
spindly cabinets, display cases of a 
wildly improbable design. Each one 
consists of fan-shaped shelves that 
fold out from a central axis and 
lock into place on different levels 
from one another. {Chaney blows.) 
Dust. Dust on everything. But not 
particularly thick. On the shelves — 
the shelves have the fragile warmth 
of mother-of-pearl — are specimens 



52 



IF 




of implements and art work. 

(A click, like stone on stone. 
Chaney s breathing.) I’m holding a 
statue about a foot-and-a-half high. 
It represents an Asadi male, full- 
maned and virile. But the statue de- 
picts him with a kind of cape 
around his shoulders and a cruel 
pair of fangs such as the Asadi — 
those of today, at any rate — don’t 
possess. {Repetition of previous 
sound, followed by a metallic ping.) 
Here’s an iron knife, with a wooden 
handle carved so that the top re- 
sembles some animal’s skull. 
Everything else in the cabinet looks 
like a weapon or a heavy tool, the 
statue’s definitely an anomaly here. 

I’m going across the chamber — 
to the wall without any cabinets on 
it. {Footfalls. Echoes.) The Flying 
Asadi Brothers are still up there, 
more rigid than the statue I just 
picked up. I’m passing directly be- 
neath them now, directly beneath 
the dome, the iron ring, the energy 
globes, the weighted golden cord 
that falls from the dome . Dizzy 
... the dimness and the distance up 
there make me dizzy. 

Don’t look at them, then, 
Chaney. Just keep moving — 
moving toward the opposite wall. 
Through an opening in the lower 
portion of the helical stairway. 
Toward the horn-colored wall on 
which there are no cabinets, gang, 
just rows upon rows of — damn this 
light, this hollowness . .let me get 
closer — of what look like tiny 
plastic wafers . .rows of wafers 
hung from a pouple thousand silver 
rods protruding for about five or six 
inches at right angles from the wall. 
The wall’s just one big elegant peg- 
board glowing like a fingernail with 



a match behind it. The rows of 
these wafers — cassettes, cigarette 
cases, match boxes — whatever you 
want to call them — begin at about 
waist level and go up two or three 
feet higher than I can reach. Asadi 
height, I suppose. 

{Five or six minutes, during 
which only Chaney* s breathing can 
be heard.) Interesting. I think I’ve 
figured this out, Eisen, I want you 
to pay attention. I’ve just un- 
fastened the carved wingnut from 
the end of one of these narrow silver 
rods and removed the first of 
several tiny cassettes hanging from 
it. Wafer was a serendipitous word 
choice, these little boxes are as thin 
as two or three transistor templates 
welded together. The faces of the 
things are about two inches square. 
I counted fifty of them hanging 
from this one six-inch rod and there 
are probably three thousand rods 
on this wall. That’s about 150,000 
cassettes altogether and this section 
of the pagoda, more than likely, is 
just a display area. 

But I want to describe the one 
I’ve got in my hand. I want to tell 
you how it works and maybe — if I 
can restrain myself— let you draw 
your own conclusions. In the center 
of this wafer — which does seem to 
be made of some kind of plastic, by 
the way — there’s an inset circle of 
glass with a diameter of less than 
half an inch. A bulb or an eye, call 
it. Beneath this eye is a rectangular 
tab, flush with the surface of the 
cassette. Above the bulb, directly 
under the hole through which the 
wall rod passes, is a band con- 
taining a series of different-colored 
dots, some of the dots touching 
each other, some not. The spacing 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



53 




of them probably has signifi- 
cance — or so I’d guess. (A chuckle.) 

And here’s how this little cracker 
box works . .oh, Eisen, don’t you 
wish you were here instead of me? I 
do, too. I really do . It’s pur- 
posely simple, I think. All you do is 
hold your thumb over the right half 
of the tab at the bottom of the 
cassette. Then the fireworks begin. 
(A pleased laugh; subsequent echo.) 

Right now the eye in the center of 
the wafer is flashing through an in- 
decipherable program of colors. 
Reds, violets, greens. Greens, sap- 
phires, pinks. All premeditatedly 
interlaced with pauses— pregnant 
pauses, no doubt . .In this dimness 
my hands are alternately lit and 
shadowed by the changing colors. 
Beautiful, beautiful. That’s just it, 
in fact. The entire system probably 
sacrifices a degree of practicality on 
the altar of beauty. 

There — I’ve shut it off. All you 
do is cover the left half of the con- 
trol rectangle with your thumb. It 
may be possible to reverse the pro- 
gram — replay it back to a desired 
point, so to speak — but I haven’t 
stumbled on the method yet. At 
least I don’t think I have. It’s 
impossible for me to remember the 
sequences of colors — though it 
probably wasn’t a bit difficult for 
the Asadi who composed, manufac- 
tured and used these things, 
however long ago that may have 
been. 

(A thumping noise.) I’m 
pocketing five of these cassettes, 
putting them in my backpack. For 
the greater glory of science. To set 
the shirttails of old Oliver Bow 
Aurm’s ghost aflame with envy. So 
Eisen and Morrell will have some- 



thing to put their screwdrivers to. 

{Musingly) Look at that wall. 
Can you imagine the information 
on hand here? The level of tech- 
nology necessary to devise a storage 
and retrieval system for a “lan- 
guage” that consists of complicated 
spectra patterns? By the way, what 
do you suppose I was “reading?” 
I’d guess that the band of colored 
dots above the eye is the description 
of the contents. The title, so to 
speak. Maybe I was scanning For- 
nications and Deflowerings by the 
Marquis de Asadi. {A chuckle.) I 
noticed that my hands had begun to 
sweat whilejhe program was run- 
ning. 

{Sober again) No, the eyebook — 
let’s call them eyebooks — was the 
first one on that particular rod. 
Maybe it’s their War and Peace, 
their Brothers Karamazov, their 
Origin of the Species, their Golden 
Bough. And what the hell have they 
done with it? Stuck it in a 
crumbling godforsaken temple in 
the middle of the Synesthesia Wild 
and forgotten about it! What 
colossal waste — what colossal ar- 
rogance! 

{Shouting) WHERE THE HELL 
DO YOU GET OFF DE- 
STROYING THE ACCUMU- 
LATED KNOWLEDGE OF 
MILLENNIA? LETTING IT SIT 
UNUSED AND ROTTING! 

(A cacophony of echoes, a 
painful ringing. ) 

(A whisper, scarcely audible.) 
That’s right, you two, you Bungling 
Brothers aerialists, pretend I don’t 
exist. Pretend you can’t hear me. 
Ignore the millennia. Ignore your

ancestors whispering to you from 
their deaths. (Venomously) And 
damn you both to hell! 

3 CHANEY (in a lifeless monotone): 
I think 1 slept for a while. I went to 
sleep under the rows and rows of 
eyebooks. Maybe for an hour. Not 
any more than that. I can tell time 
with the bottoms of my feet — by 
the warmth of the depression in the 
backpack where I put my head. 

A noise woke me, a ringing of 
iron. Now I’m on the helical 
stairway high above the museum 
floor. I’m in a curve of the stairway 
a little below and opposite the glass 
platform where The Bachelor was 
standing. He isn’t there anymore. A 
moment ago he chinned himself up 
to the cold ring of the chandelier, 
gained his feet and balanced on the 
ring, then reached out and grabbed 
the plumbline that drops down 
from the dome. 

The huri? The huri squats on the 
globe, in the triangle of globes, 
pointing toward the front of the 
temple — he got off The Bachelor’s 
shoulder a good while ago. 

After grabbing the gold braid 
The Bachelor fashioned a noose 
and slipped his neck into it. Then he 
swung himself out over the floor so 
that his feet — right now, at this very 
moment — are hanging a little below 
the ring of the chandelier. I’m 
watching him hang there, his feet 
turning, inscribing an invisible 
circle inside the larger circle of the 
globe-set fixture. 

But hc^isn’t dead. No, he’s not a 
bit dead. The noose is canted so 
that it catches him under the throat 
in the plush of his mane. In the two 
weeks since his designation his 



mane has thickened considerably, 
especially along his jaws and under 
his throat, and the new fur cushions 
the steadily constricting braid. So 
now he’s just hanging there. The 
dangling man. 

(Listlessly) A pretty damn 
interesting development, I suppose. 
At least the huri acts like it’s 
interesting. The huri’s watching all 
this with either excitement or 
agitation, beating its wings spo- 
radically and skittering to stay atop 
the globe it’s perched on. (A bump. 
Unintelligible mumbling.) See if 
you can hear it. I’ll hold the 
microphone out for you. (Silence, 
vaguely static-filled.) That’s it, the 
huri’s claws scrabbling on the 
globe — the sound of The Bachelor’s 
feet turning north, north-east, east, 
south-east, south, south-south 
west . 

(After almost ten minutes of 
near-silence) A while ago I saw that 
The Bachelor had begun to drool. A 
thin thread of something milky 
glistened on his bottom lip as he 
turned, his feet revolving first to the 
rjght and then back to the left. I 
saw his mouth working — almost 
like an insect’s mouth. The strand 
of drool got longer, it didn’t drop 
away into the abyss of the stairwell, 
it kept growing and growing, 
lengthening like a somehow milky 
extension of the gold plumbline. 

Now the strand has fallen down 
the center of the helix so that it’s a 
little below the place where I’m sit- 
ting. I can see that it’s not a liquid 
at all, not any sort of spittle or 
vomit. It’s a fiber, something spun 
from The Bachelor’s gut and paid 
out through his mouth. (Unawed) 
Beautiful and grotesque at once — 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI

and ril bet you think Vm drunk or 
drugged. Making silk out of a 
souse’s fears, so to speak. But I’ve 
imbibed no bourbon, laddies, 
played with no Placenol — and I 
wish you were sitting on this 
cramped iron stairway watching 
this disgusting show, this ritual 
unraveling of The Bachelor’s in- 
nards. Gut-strands. Beautiful and 
grotesque gut-strands. 

{Unemotionally) God, but my 
patience has been tried . 

(Several more minutes pass, 
A faint flapping commences, 
continues for a while, then 
ceases.) 

The Bachelor’s been paying out 
silk as if he were made of it. The 
single strand I told you about a 
while ago, well, it damn near 
reached the floor. Then he started 
working with his hands, reeling it 
back in and making his body turn 
faster in the canted noose. He’s 
wrapping himself in the stuff, like 
an Egyptian king who’s decided to 
be a mummy before he dies. Mean- 
while he makes more and more 
’cloudy thread. 

Guess who’s gotten into the act, 
gang? Right again. The huri flew 
off its globe when The Bachelor 
began reeling in his gut strand and 
caught up a section of the strand in 
its claws. Then, with both its claws 
and hands, flapping in higgledy-zig- 
gledy circles, it covered The 
Bachelor’s feet, his ankles, and his 
shins. After that it settled on the old 
boy’s wrapped feet. Now, its wings 
outspread, its claws probably 
hooked into The Bachelor’s flesh. 



the huri’s hanging up there like a 
bat and still wrapping its master in 
gut-extruded cable. And the damn 
thing’s blind, mind you, blind as — a 
drunken xenologist. Good boy, 
Chaney. 

I don’t know how long it’ll take, 
but in a while The Bachelor will be 
encased — ^completely encased, it 
seems — in a murky chrysalis. The 
huri looks as if it would like to 
finish and tie off the job as soon as 
it can. It’s already binding in the 
Asadi’s hands, pulling thread 
around his thighs, clawing up his 
long body inch by inch like a freak- 
ish circus performer. Then The 
Bachelor will be nothing but a lop- 
sided pupa hanging from a gold 
cord inside the loft of his ancestors’ 
rickety barn — I guess. 

( Chaney grunts. Shuffling 
sounds; perhaps the shifting of 
a burden.) 

I guess. Don’t ask me. I won’t 
watch any more of this foolishness. 
I’m dizzy. I’m fed up with this 
nonsense. If I can make it down 
these steps in this hell-glow I’m 
going to lie down beside the wall of 
eyebooks and go to sleep. Directly 
to sleep. 

(Footfalls on the iron steps. 
Unintelligible mumbling. ) 

Interlude: early afternoon of Day 

CHANEY {speaking conversa- 
tionally): Hello. I’m talking to 
Benedict alone now. Ben? Ben, 
you’re supposed to make a drop 
tomorrow. Your twentieth. Can 
you believe that? 1 can’t either. It 



56 



IF 




doesn’t seem like more than ten or 
twelve years that I’ve been out here. 
Twenty drops. Well, 1 may not pick 
up this latest one. Not for a while, 
anyway. God knows when The 
Bachelor will want to lead me out 
of here and back to the clearing. At 
the moment he’s occupied. Let me 
tell you how. 

First, let me tell you what’s going 
on. I’m standing here by one of the 
dusty display cases. All its shelves 
are folded up against the central 
axis, like the petals of a flower at 
night. But it’s early afternoon, 
Ben — dull light is seeping through 
the dome. Even so, every cabinet in 
the place is shut up like a new rose. 
Every one of them. It happened, I 
guess, while I was sleeping. The 
globes overhead, the three globes in 
the chandelier up there — their fires 
have gone out of them, they’re as 
dead and as mutely mottled as 
dinosaur eggs. I don’t know exactly 
when that happened, either. One 
other thing — the eyebooks don’t 
work today. I’ve fiddled with 
twenty or thirty of them, holding 
my thumb over the rectangular tab 
beneath the eye — but nothing, not 
even two colors in a row, not so 
much as a glimmer. 



*****From the end of the previous section 
to the beginning of this one Chaney engaged 
in a great deal of “irrelevant blathering.” I 
have deleted it. Altogether, about twelve or 
fourteen hours of real time passed, time 
during which Chaney also slept and ate. In 
this “Interlude” I have taken the liberty of 
borrowing small sections from the deleted 
passages in order to provide a continuity 
which would not otherwise exist. For sim- 
plicity’s sake, these insertions are not 
marked. 



Today the pagoda’s dead. That’s 
all there is to it: the pagoda’s dead. 
And 1 have the feeling that it won’t 
come alive again until Denebola 
has set and darkness sits on Bosk- 
Veld like the shadow, the crumpled 
shadow, of the huri’s wings. 

But The Bachelor — the cocoon — 
you want to know what happened 
to him. To it. Again, I don’t know 
exactly. During the night the 
plumbline from which he fashioned 
the noose — the line from which he 
then hung out over the pagoda’s 
floor while the huri wrapped him in 
the false silk of his own bowels — 
that golden line, I tell you, has 
lengthened and dropped through 
the ring of the chandelier so that it’s 
now only a few feet from the floor. 
It descended, I suppose, of its own 
accord. (A chuckle,) I’d estimate 
that between the floor and the bot- 
tom of The Bachelor’s chrysalis 
there’s now only enough space to 
wedge a small stool. A very small 
footstool . .and now the ungainly 
pupa hungs in the daylight gloom of 
this chamber and turns slowly, 
slowly, first to the right, then to the 
left, like the gone-awry pendulum 
in a grandfather clock. That’s it, 
Ben, brawny Big Ben, this whole 
building’s just an outsized time- 
piece. You can hear Bosk Veld 
ticking in its orbit — Listen . 

As for the huri, it crouches on the 
uppermost node of the pupa — the 
point at which the braid breaks 
through — and rides The Bachelor’s 
mummified head as it used to ride 
his shoulder. Each time the wrap- 
ped body turns this way I feel that 
the huri’s staring at me, taking my 
measure. If I had a pistol. I’d shoot 
the. damn thing — I swear I would. 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



57 




Even if it meant that the concussion 
would split the seams of this temple 
and send it crashing down on my 
ears — every fragile cabinet shat- 
tering, every eyebook bursting 
open. So help me, I would — which 
is probably why I didn’t bring a 
pistol, a hand-laser or a light-can- 
non out here in the first place. But 
now the little beastie is clawing ner- 
vously at the silken membrane, un- 
hinging its wings and shaking their 
outstretched tips a little — I think, 
gang, we’re ^oing to get some 
action. Give me a few minutes, just 
a few . 

{Later) Action, indeed. The huri’s 
moving in its own catch-as-catch- 
can fashion down the swaying 
cocoon that houses The Bachelor. 
As it moves it peels back pieces of 
the membrane, snips them off with 
its feet, transfers the pieces to its 
greedy hands and eats them. That’s 
right, eats them. I had been 
wondering what the little bugger 
subsisted on and this apparently is 
the answer — it feeds on the husk of 
the Asadi chieftain’s metamor- 
phosis, it feeds on the rind of its 
master’s involuntary change. That’s 
phrasing it a little philosophically, I 
suppose, but I can’t help thinking 
that the huri’s eating The 
Bachelor’s former self. It’s crab- 
walking in a spiral down the 
cocoon — a spiral that mirrors the 
great corkscrew of the pagoda’s 
staircase — and it furiously gobbles 
up the membrane that it has snip- 
ped away. 

TTie beast is at the hollow of The 
Bachelor’s chest and I can see my 
old friend’s head. I mean that I can 
see the outline of his head — because 
even though the silken covering has 



been eaten away, a milk-blue film 
remains. It clings to his features 
like a thin hood. It’s moist and 
trembly and through it I can see the 
death mask of his face. 

Ben, Ben, you can’t expect me to 
stay here and watch this. Tell the 
others not to expect that of me. The 
bitch-goddess of xenology has 
worked me over too many times al- 
ready and I’m nauseated with 
fatigue. With disgust. It’s worse 
than last night. There’s an odor in 
the temple, a smell like excrement 
and rot and the discharges of the 
glands — I don’t know what . 



(A retching sound. Then a 
rapid succession of footfalls, 
suggestive of running. ) 

4 CHANEY {his voice thin but 
genial): We’re in the Wild again. 
Out in the open. Out among the 
singing leaves, the dancing moons, 
the glittering winds, the humidity is 
horrible. It makes my nose run. 
But after spendihg one sorenecked 
night in the refrigerated vault of 
that Asadi warehouse — and one 
stomach-turning day in it when it 
changed from a warehouse into a 
charnel house — well, the humidity’s 
a welcome relief. Yes, indeed. Let 
my nose run as it may, where it 
may — even though I don’t know 
where the hell the face it’s running 
on is running to. Actually, we’re 
not running at all. We’re moving 
quite leisurely, the Bachelor and me 
ajid the huri — in no hurry at all. 

{Clinically) I feel pretty well now. 
The horror of this afternoon has 
evaporated. 1 don’t know why it 
made me ill. It wasn’t that bad. 



58 



IF 




really, I should have stayed and 
watched everything. That’s what I 
came out her^ for. But when the 
smell in there got so bad— my 
system’s been under a strain. I had 
to get out of there. 

I bolted for the pagoda’s en- 
trance, pushed the heavy doors 
aside, ran down the tier of steps. 
The sunlight increased my 
nausea — but 1 couldn’t go back in- 
side, Ben, so I’m not entirely 
certain what the final circum- 
stances of The Bachelor’s removal 
from the cocoon were. Like a little 
boy waiting for the library to open, 

I sat on the bottom step of the pa- 
goda and held my head in my 
hands. I was ill. Really ill. It wasn’t 
just an emotional thing. But now I 
feel better and the night — the stars 
twinkling up there like chipped 
ice — seems like my friend. 

(Wistfully) I wish I could navi- 
gate by those stars — but I can’t. 
Their patterns are still unfamiliar 
to me . Maybe we’re going back to 
the clearing. Maybe I’ll be able to 
pick up tomorrow’s drop after all. 1 
know I feel well enough now to try. 

The Bachelor is striding ahead of 
me; the huri’s on his shoulder. 1 
know — 

(The sound of wind and 
leaves corroborates Chaneys 
testimony that they are out of 
doors, out of the temple, } 

— I know, you’re wondering what 
he looks like, what his disposition 
is, what his metamorphosis accom- 
plished for him. Well, g2ing. I’m not 
sure. You see, he looks about the 
same. As I said, I didn’t go back 
into the museum. I waited outside 



until the sun had set, thinking all 
the while that I would go back up 
the steps when the darkness was 
complete. I knew that my two 
charming friends couldn’t get out 
any other way, that I wouldn’t be 
stranded there alone. At least I 
hadn’t seen any other doors while I 
was inside. The ancient Asadi ap- 
parently didn’t see any need to 
leave themselves a multitude of 
outs. The end they’ve come to sup- 
ports that hypothesis. But before I 
could steel myself to reentering the 
pagoda— just as the twilight_ had 
begun to lose its gloss — The 
Bachelor appeared on the highest 
step. 

And came down the steps. 

And walked right by me. He 
didn’t look at me. The huri, 
clinging to his mane, had the co- 
matose appearance that 1 re- 
member it’s possessing when Eisen 
Zwei came into the Asadi clearing 
for the second time. Now I know 
why it looked "so bloated and inca- 
pable of movement — it had just in- 
gested the old man’s pupa, if Eisen 
Zwei could have so encased 
himself. So help me, I still haven’t 
figured this out. I may never figure 
it out. Anyhow, I noticed only two 
small changes in The Bachelor as 
he stalked past me into the jungle. 
First, his mane is now a full-grown 
collar of fur — still a little damp 
from the filmy blue substance that 
lined the chrysalis. And second, a 
thin cloak of this film stretches 
between The Bachelor’s naked 
shoulderblades and falls in folds to 
the small of his back. Probably, it 
just hasn’t dropped away yet. 

And that’s it. His eyes are still as 
mute, as white, as uncommuni- 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI

cative as they had ever been. 

We’re in a tunnel, sort of. We’ve 
been walking, slipping beneath the 
vines, about thirty or forty 
minutes. A while ago we came upon 
a kind of footpath, a beaten trail 
that permits us to walk upright — 
just as if we were in a recreation 
park. The only such trail I’ve seen 
in the Synesthesia Wild, ever. The 
Bachelor’s moving down it easily 
and once again I’m having no diffi- 
culty keeping up. 

But I’m lost. 

(A^considerable pause during 
which the sounds of the Wild 
assert themselves: wind 

through the leaves, distant 
water, the soft shushing of feet 
in the dirt. ) 

(Pensively) All the time I’ve 
spent in the Asadi clearing, all that 
time watching them amble around 
and wear down their heels to no 
purpose — it seems like centuries 
ago. No kidding, Ben, Eisen. That 
time in the clearing just doesn’t 
exist right now. Lost as I am, I feel 
like I could follow The Bachelor 
down this narrow trail forever. 

But his metamorphosis— or lack 
of it — bothers me. I’ve been 
thinking about it. My considered, 
but not necessarily considerate, 
opinion is that the old chieftain is 
exactly what he used to be. Ana- 
tomically speaking, that is. Maybe 
the very brief time he spent 
hibernating in that homemade 
sleeping bag of his altered him psy- 
chologically rather than physically. 

(Ten minutes of wind, water, 
and shush-shushing feet. ) 



5 CHANEY (whispering): There’s 
something in the trees ahead of us. 
A crouched, dark shape. The 
Bachelor just turned on me — he 
wouldn’t let me approach with him. 
If I don’t stay fairly close. I’ll be 
lost out here. Damn you, you 
hulking boonie, I won’t let you 
leave me. We’re off the trail. We’ve 
been off it a good while and the 
trees, the vines, the twisted roots — 
everything looks the same; one spot 
is like ahother. I’m disobeying the 
bastard. I’m staying close enough 
to keep him in sight every second. 
He’s out there in a ragged hallway 
of leaves moving toward the thing 
in the tree. I know that it’s there be- 
cause he knows that it’s there. It’s 
like a tumor in the branches, a 
lump to which the moonlight gives 
a suspicious fuzziness. You should 
see the way he’s approaching that 
thing. He’s spread his arms out 
wide and is taking one long step at a 
time, one long easy step. Like an 
adagio S.S. man. The membrane 
between his shoulder blades has 
opened out, too, so that it makes a 
fan-shaped drapery across his back. 
Shadows shift across it, shadows 
and moonlight . What a weird 

boonie. You should see him. He’s a 
kind of moving, blown. up version 
of the drunken huri clinging to his 
mane. We’re closer now. That thing 
up there, whatever it is, it’s either 
dead or inanimate or hypnotized — 
hypnotized, I think. I’m sure that 
it’s one of the Asadi. A gray shape. 
Ordinarily, you don’t get this close 
at night, you just don’t. The 
Bachelor’s hypnotized it with his 
slow-motion goose step, the filmy 
rippling of the membrane across his 
back and arms — maybe even with 



60 



IF 




his empty eyes . .now we’re just 
waiting, waiting. I’m as close as I 
can get without jeopardizing the 
purity of this confrontation. I can 
see eyes up there. Asadi eyes, 
stalled on a sickly pink. {Aloud, 
over a sudden thrashing.) The damn 
thing’s just jumped out of the 
branches! It’s one of the Asadi all 
right, a lithe gray female. The 
Bachelor’s wrenching her backward 
to the ground, the huri’s fallen 
sidelong away from him, fluttering, 
fluttering in the thicket under the 
tree! 

{A heavy bump; continued 
thrashing.) 

{Chaney s voice skyrockets to an 
uncontrolled falsetto) 1 KNEW IT, 

I KNEW WHAT YOU WERE! 
DEAR LORD, I WON’T 
PERMIT IT IN FRONT OF ME! 

I WON’T PERMIT YOUR EVIL 
TO FLOURISH! {Scuffling. Then, 
weakly) Leave me alone, leave me . 

Violent noises: then a hum of 
static and low breathing. ) 

6 CHANEY {panting): My head 

aches — I’ve b^n ill again. But it’s 
sweet here; I’m kneeling in grass 
under the trees by the edge of the 
pagoda’s clearing . I’ve been ill 
again, yes, but I’ve done heroic 
things. I’m doing a damn heroic 
thing right now. You can hear me, 
can’t you? I’m talking out loud . 
OUT LOUD, DAMN IT! And 
he’s not about to stop me — he’s just 
going to sit there opposite me with 
his long legs folded and take it . 
Aren’t you, boonie? Aren’t you? 
That’s right, that’s a good boonie 



. He can’t believe the deed 
I’ve done, Ben. He can’t believe 
I’ve freed him from that scabby lit- 
tle battlecock. There’s blood on the 
grass. Dark sweet blood. Too 
sweet, Ben. I’ve go to get up . 

{Chaney moans. A rustling of 
clothes — then his strained voice) 
Okay. Fine. A little bark to lean 
against here, a tree with spiny shin- 
gles. {A stumping sound.) Good, 
good — I refused to let myself get 
disoriented, Ben. We came 
marching— slogging, more like — 
right through that opening there, 
that portal of ferns and violet 
blossoms. oh, hell, you can’t see 
where I’m pointing, can you? You 
wouldn’t see, probably, even if you 
were here. But we slogged to this 
place from that direction I’m 
pointing and I kept my head about 
me all the way. My head, by the 
way, aches because he bashed me 
down — he elbowed me in the eye. 
They always elbow, the Asadi — 
they think elbows were given to 
them to jab in other people’s ribs 
and faces, even The Bachelor. He 
knocked me down, bloodied me, 
damn him, when I tried to stop him 
from slaughtering this poor woman 
here, the one that lies here 
butchered in the grass. He knocked 
me down and I couldn’t stop him. 
Then he whirled her up over his 
shoulder, grabbed the huri out of 
the bushes by its feet. Took off 
through the jungle, the Wild ringing 
like a thousand wind chimes be- 
cause of my head, my aching eye. 
To keep from getting lost, I had to 
follow him. E)ear God, I had to 
hobble along after that crazy crew... 
Then when we reached this little 
patch of grass among the trees — the 



death AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



61 




pagoda's right over there — he threw 
the dead woman on the ground and 
disemboweled her. I saw him doing 
it as I came up through the jungle 
after him. you see, I got here 
three or four minutes after he did. I 
collapsed, I collapsed and watched. 
I held my bad eye and squinted 
through the other ... in ten or 
twelve minutes I’d forgotten what it 
all meant, and the woman didn’t 
look like an Asadi any more. Now 
the grass is littered with her — and 
The Bachelor didn’t even have to 
strike me to keep me from in- 
terfering. But, Ben, I couldn’t help 
that; it was all owing to my head 
and my fatigue — I wasn’t thinking 
straight. 1 didn’t realize he was 
butchering the creature. As soon 
as I could I remedied the situation. 
And that’s why I’m still a little sick. 
But my head’s clear now; it aches 
but it’s clear. And the boonie isn’t 
about to strike me again. Are you, 
boonie? All he can do is sit and 
stare at me. I’ve intimidated the 
hell out of him. He thought I was 
some kind of maneless Asadi 
vermin and he can’t reconcile 
himself to this new image of me. 
Poor mute bastard. My heroic deed 
kicked him right in his psycho- 
logical solar plexus. 

(Almost pompously) As the 
nfioons are my witness, I killed the 
huri. I killed the huri! No, no, the 
boonie can’t believe it either but I 
swear by holy heaven it’s true. 

Just look at him, look at him 
making slow Figure eights with his 
chin. God, but I’ve boggled him! 
He thought me just another Asadi, 
a low Asadi dog — and when he had 
finished carving up that pitifully 
helpless woman, that sweet long- 



legged lady, he set the huri down 
atop her carcass — I had to do 
something then. I pulled myself up. 
But the huri was sitting there on her 
butchered body, staring at me 
blindly. Old boonie-boy had put it 
there to guard her corpse, just the 
way Eisen Zwei had done in the 
clearing the day he carried in three 
slaughtered kinsmen as a feast of- 
fering. The huri meant I wasn’t sup- 
posed to move, I was supposed to 
be a good cannibal and wait until 
dinner had been properly served. 
I’m not an Asadi — I’ll be damned if 
I’m an Asadi and I didn’t — no, by 
God, I didn’t — pay any heed to The 
Batchie-boy’s stupid sentinel. I 
killed it. I ran up and kicked the 
huri with my boot. It fluttered 
backward and I was upon it with 
the heel of my boot, grinding its 
Filthy little no-face into the grass. 
Its body split open. Pus spilled out 
like putty from a plastic tube, 
stinking to the skies — that’s what 
made me sick, the sight and the 
stink of the huri’s insides. I 
stumbled away, fell to my knees. 

The Bachelor couldn’t move. 
Killing the huri had given me a hold 
over him, a power. He just sat, like 
he’s sitting now, and watched me. 
The smell of the grass revived me, 
convinced me of my own heroism, 
my own crimson-bloody heroism — 
and that’s when I knew I had to tell 
you about it, when I started talking 
through my sickness and the too- 
sweet smell of the grass. 

(Mockingly) Are you awed, 
boonie? Is that your trouble? Could 
1 walk right over there and kick 
your face in if I tried? Yes, oh, yes, 
I could. Damn it, Ben, I’m in con- 
trol, I’m on top! 



62 



IF 




( Laughter, prolonged 
laughter: then virtual silence. ) 

Power’s an evanescent thing, 
Ben. (Musingly) He just stood up. 
The Bachelor did, uncoiled and 
faced me like an enemy. 1 thought I 
was dead, I really did. I know that’s 
a turnabout — you don’t have to re- 
quire consistency of me when I’m 
ill. But he only stared at me for a 
minute, then turned and walked 
across the open clearing toward the 
temple. He’s climbing the steps 
right now, very slowly, a gray shape 
like the gray shape he killed. Every 
moon is up. The three of them rip- 
ple his shadow down the tier of 
steps behind him. I’m not going 
into that place again, gang, he 
needn’t wait for me — and he isn’t 
waiting. Fine. Excellent. I’ll stay 
here in the grass, under the vines 
and fire blossoms, until it’s 
morning. Let him go, let him go. 
But, damn him, he can’t leave me in 
this gut-strewn glade! It reeks; the 
grass is black with gore. And 
here— just look at this. What the 
hell is it? You’ve got to get down 
i groaning it: a little pocket of 
globular tripe here on the edge of 
the grass, just where the moonlight 
falls. Three of them nestled in the 
grass, three palpitant little globes — 
I think they’re ova, Ben, all of them 
about the size of my thumbnails. 
Much bigger than a human being’s 
minute reproductive cells. But ova 
nevertheless. Ovaries. That’s my 
guess. They glisten and seem alive, 
glowing as they do. The Bachelor 
placed them here while , he was 
butchering the poor lady. He was 
careful not to crush them — he laid 
them out so that they’d form an 



equilateral triangle here in this nest 
of grass. It’s like — well, it’s like the 
arrangement of the globes in the 
chandelier ring inside the pagoda . 

But I’m not going back in there, 
boonie— I’M NOT GOING 
BACK IN THERE! DO YOU 
UNDERSTAND THAT? I’M 
NOT GOING... 

7 CHANEY (bewildered): Where 
is it? Eisen, you said we could s^e it 
from this hemisphere — you said it 
was visible. But I’m standing here, 
standing out here in front of the 
Asadi’s hulking temple where there 
aren’t any branches to block my 
view and, damn you, Eisen, I don’t 
see it. I don’t see it! Just those 
blinding moons dancing up and 
down and a sky full of sparkling 
cobwebs. Where’s Sol? Where’s our 
own sun? Eisen, you said we could 
see it with the unaided eye. I’m sure 
you said that — but 1 don’t see it! 
It’s lost out there in a cobwebbing 
of stars — lost! 

(Suddenly resolute) I’m going 
back into the temple. Yes, by God, 
I am. The Bachelor doesn’t care if I 
stay out here and rot with the poor 
butchered lady he’s abandoned. 
He’s abandon^ me, too. Twenty 
minutes I’ve been out here alone, 
twenty minutes staring at the dark 
grass, the dark sweet grass. He 
wants me to die from its cloying 
reek; that’s what he’s after. I killed 
his huri. A man who kills a huri 
isn’t one to put up with a passive 
death, though. He forgot that. If I 
have to die, Ben, it’ll be heroically, 
not the way he wants. I’ve taken too 
much to sit cross-legged under the 
trees and wait for either my own 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



63 




death or the corrupt hunger that 
would keep me alive. I won’t eat his 
offering, that poor butchered lady, 
and I won’t stay out here either! 

There’s a beautiful golden cord in 
the pagoda, a beautiful golden cord. 
That should do it. If the boonie’s 
still too shaken up from his loss, his 
stinking bereavement, to lead me 
back to the clearing — the Asadi 
clearing — that plumbline ought to 
serve. I’ve worked with my hands; I 
can fashion a noose as well as any 
dumpling-hearted boonie. And then 
carry it through where he couldn’t. 
Just come along, gang, and see if I 
can’t. 

(The shush-shushing of feet 
in the dirt, Chaney s 
shortmndedness as he climbs 
the temple s steps, the inward- 
groaning utterance of a heavy 
door.) 

(From this point on, Chaneys 
each word has the brief after-echo, 
the telltale hollowness imparted by 
the empty volume of a large 
building s interior)****** It’s cold. 
You wouldn’t believe how cold it is 
in here, Ben. Cold and dark. No 
light is filtering down through the 
dome and the chandelier — the 
chandelier’s out! My eyes aren’t ac- 
customed. ,(A bump.) Here’s a 
cabinet. I’ve scraped my elbow. The 
shelves are down and I scraped my 
elbow on one of the shelves. I’m

simulable conditions thaf convinces me of 
the authenticity of the tapes. How much of 
what Chaney reports is hallucination rather 
than reality, however, I’m not prepared to 
conjecture. 



going to stand here a minute. The 
cabinets give off their own faint 
light, a very warm faint light, and 
I’ll be able to see a good deal better 
if I just stand here and let my pupils 
adjust. It’s the same cabinet I 
described for you last night! Or one 
just like it, 1 guess. The statue, the 
knife, the implements and 
weapons — nothing is different. (A 
scraping sound, somewhat glassy. ) 
Well, wait a minute. Here’s a dif- 
ference. The bottom petals of this 
cabinet have been broken off, torn 
away. I’m standing in the shards. 
And I’m not the vandal, Ben — the 
shards were already here. I just 
stepped on them, that’s all. The lit- 
tle bump I gave the cabinet couldn’t 
have done this — someone had to 
work energetically at these shelves 
to break them away. The Bachelor, 
maybe? The Bachelor’s the only 
one in here besides me. Did he want 
an axe to stalk me with? Did he 
need one of his ancestors’ orna- 
mental knives before he felt 
competent to take on the pink- 
fleshed Asadi outcast who killed his 
poor rubber rooster? Poor, poor 
rubber rooster — IS THAT IT, 
BOONIE? YOU AFRAID OF 
ME NOW? (Crashing echoes. 
Chaney s voice becomes huskily 
confidential) I think that’s it, Ben, I 
think that’s why the globe lamps 
are out, why this place is so dark, 
why this cabinet is broken. The 
boonie wants to kill me — he’s 
stalking me in the dark. Well, that’s 
fine, too. That’s more heroic than 
the cord, an excellent death — I’ll 
even grapple with him a little. 
Beowulf and Grendel. It shouldn’t 
take very long. The lady he killed 
felt almost nothing — I’m sure of

IF 




that. OVER HERE, BOONIE! 
YOU KNOW WHERE I AM! 
COME ON, THEN! COME ON! 
I WONT MOVE! 



(A confusion of echoes, 
dissonant and reverberating. 
Complete silence but for 
Chaney*s chronic shortwind- 
edness. This continues for four 
or five tense minutes. Then a 
forceful crack followed by a 
tremendously amplified shat- 
tering sound — like a box full of 
china breaking. Chaney gives a 
startled cry.) 



(Whispering) My dear God — the 
pagoda’s flooded with light now — 
flooded with light from the three 
globes in the great iron fixture that 
yesterday hung just beneath the 
dome. It’s different now — the iron 
ring is floating about five feet from 
the floor. The Bachelor is inside the 
ring, stabbing at one of the globes 
with a long-handled pick. He’s al- 
ready chipped away a big mottled 
piece of its covering. The piece 
shattered on the floor. You heard it 
shatter. (Aloud) And all three 
globes are pulsing with energy, 
angry energy. They’re filling the 
temple with electricity — a deadly 
chill — their own anger. I’m sure 
they’ve generated the field that 
keeps the iron ring afloat, the ring 
hovering like a circular prison 
around The Bachelor’s shoulders. 
The plumbline whips back and 
fourth as he jabs — it has damn near 
entangled him. And he’s caught in- 
side the ring — caught there and he 
keeps jabbing at the foremost globe 
with his pick. 



(The jabbing sounds punc- 
tuate Chaney* s headlong nar- 
rative — apparently, another 

piece of the globes covering 
falls to the floor and shatters.) 

Why the hell doesn’t he duck out 
of there? Is he trapped in that field? 
I can see he’s too damn busy to be 
worried about me, to want to kill 
me. All right. That’s fine. I’ll cheer 
him on, I’ll give him moral sup- 
port— HIT IT A LICK, BOONIE! 

All the cabinets are open. All the 
shelves are down. I can see them 
now. The pagoda’s alive again. All 
it took was the dark and a litfle vio- 
lence. 

The foremost globe has split wide 
open — he’s knocked the crown off 
it. And listen, Ben, listen. Sorne- 
thing is moving inside it, inside the 
intact bottom half. The ring is 
canting to one side and it’s dimmer 
in here. Suddenly dimmer. If he 
keeps banging away at those globes 
this whole place will be drained of 
light — the shelves will fold back up 
and lock into position forever. Can 
you hear the scrabbling in the 
broken globe? Can you hear it, 
Ben? Do you already know what it 
is? I can see it and hear it both. In 
this dimness there’s a flickering in 
that shell, a flickering like the 
hissing tatters of a black flame . 
Sweet Jesus, Ben, it’s a huri scrab- 
bling about in there, a black-black, 
blind-blind huri! It’s clawing at the 
shell and pulling itself upright even 
as the ring dips toward the floor. 

(A fluttering which is dis- 
tinctly audible over both 
Chaney s voice and the tapping 
of The Bachelor* s pick. ) 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



65 




It’s in the air — a clumsy beast a 
little larger than the one 1 killed. 
And there’s a smell in here just like 
the smell when I ground out the 
guts of the other huri. Damn it! The 
Asadi are idiots! The Bachelor is 
stabbing at another globe — he 
wants to let another one out. He 
wants to let all three of them out so 
that we’ll be plunged in darkness 
and flapping wings and maybe even 
the dome will fall in on us. 

To himself he can do that — to 
me, no sir! I’m getting out of here, 
Ben, I’m going to go tumbling 
down the steps while there’s still 
light to tumble by. What a mad- 
house, what a sacred madhouse. 
Old Oliver Bow Aurm should kiss 
the nearest maggot for saving him 
from this — figurative maggot, that 
is. BoskVeld crawls with figurative 
maggots — and I’m coming home. 
I’m coming home to you. To you, 
my kinsmen . 



{Footfalls, a heavy wooden 
groaning, and then the 
unechoing silence of the night 
as Chaney emerges into the 
Wild) 



8 CHANEY (exhilarated): God, look 
at them go off! I’m unloading my 
backpack. I’m lobbing them 
toward old Sol, wherever the 
debbil he at. Another Independence 
Day! My second one. (Four or five 
successive whooshing sounds,) I’m 
coming home. I’m coming home. 
To you, Ben. To Eisen, Morrell and 
Jonathan. You won’t be able to say 
1 don’t do things with a flare. Or 
flares. (Laughter,) God, look at 



them stain the sky! Look at them 
smoke! Look at them burn away 
the reek of Asadi self-delusion! 

No,^ by God, we don’t destroy 
every race we run across. Maybe 
the pygmies, maybe we did it to the 
pygmies — but the Asadi, bless ’em, 
they’re doing it to themselves — 
they’ve been doing it to themselves 
for eons. And, God, look at that 
clean phosphorescent sky! I only 
wish I knew which direction Sol 
was in — I’d like to see it. I’d like to 
see it like a shard of ice glittering in 
the center of those flaming 
cobwebs. 



Thomas Benedict speaking: last 
things 

We saw the flares and picked up 
Chaney, Moses Eisen was with me 
in the copter. We had come out 
extremely early on the morning of 
Day 140 in order to complete 
Chaney s customary supply drop 
and then to circle the Asadi clearing 
with the thought of making a 
naked-eye sighting of the cultural 
xenologist. Captain Eisen ordered 
this course of action when it be- 
came apparent that Chaney was not 
agoing to communicate with us of 
his own accord. The captain wished 
to appraise himself of Chaneys 
condition, perhaps by landing and 
talking with the man. He wanted 
him to return to base camp. If it 
had not been for these unusual cir- 
cumstances, Chaney s flares might 
have gone off for no audience but 
the empty sky. 

As it was, we saw only the last 
two or three flares that he set off 
and had to reverse the direction of 
our copter to make the rendezvous. 



66 



IF 




By the time we reached him Chaney 
was no longer the exhilarated ad- 
venturer that the last section of his 
monologue paints him — he was a 
tired and sick man who did not 
seem to recognize us when we set 
down and who came aboard the 
copter bleary-eyed and unshaven, 
his arms draped across our shoul- 
ders. By removing his backpack we 
came into possession of the 
recorder he had used for the last 
two days and the **eyebooks** he 
had supposedly picked up in the 
Asadi temple. And that night I 
went back to the Asadi clearing 
alone in order to retrieve the re- 
mainder of his personal effects. 

Back at base camp, however, we 
committed Chaney at once to the 
care of Ddctors Williams and 
Tsyuki and saw to it that he had a 
private room in the infirmary. 
During this time, as I mentioned 
earlier, he wrote The Ritual of 
Death and Designation. He 
claimed, in more than one of our 
conversations, that we had picked 
him up not more than four or Jive 
hundred yards from the pagoda he 
describes. He made this claim even 
though we were unable on several 
trips over this area to discover a 
clearing large enough to accom- 
modate such a structure. Not once 
in all of our talks, however, did he 
ever claim that he had been inside 
the pagoda. Only in the confiscated 
tape does one encounter this bizarre 
notion: you have just read the 
edited transcript of the tape and can 
decide for yourself how much 
credence to give its various reports. 
One thing is certain — the ** eye- 
books** that Chaney brought out of 
the Synesthesia Wild with him do 



exist. And they had to come from 
somewhere. 

The eyebooks are a complete 
puzzle. They look exactly as 
Chaney describes them in the tape, 
but none of them work. The cas- 
settes are seamless plastic, and the 
only really efficient way we*ve been 
able to get inside one is to break the 
bulb, the glass eyelet, and probe 
through the opening with old- 
fashioned watch tools. If the 
**books** were indeed fprogramed as 
Chaney reports in his tape, we*ve 
found nothing inside the cassettes 
on which these programs could 
have been inscribed and no energy 
source to power such a ra^ 
presentation of spectra patterns. 
Morrell has suggested that the pro- 
grams exist in the molecular struc- 
ture of the plastic casings 
themselves, but there is no ready 
way to confirm this. The eyebooks 
remain an enigma. 

As for Chaney, he apparently 
recovered. He would not discuss the 
tape that / once — only once — con- 
fronted him with, but he did talk 
about putting together a book- 
length account of his findings. **The 
Asadi have to be described,** 
Chaney once told me. **They have 
to be described in detail. It*s 
essential that we get every culture 
we find out here down on paper, 
down on tape, down on holographic 
storage cubes. The pen is mightier 
than the sword and paper is 
more durable than flesh.** But 
Chaney didn*t do his book. Three 
months he stayed with us, copying 
his notes, working in the base-camp 
library. Joining us only every sixth 
or seventh meal in the general mess. 
He kept to himself, as isolated 



DEATH AND DESIGNATION AMONG THE ASADI 



67 




among us as he had been in the 
Asadi clearing. And he did a lot of 
thinking, a lot of somber, melan- 
choly, fatalistic thinking. 

He did something else that few of 
us paid much attention to. He grew 
a beard and refused to have his hair 
cut. Later we understood why. 

One morning we could not find 
Egan Chaney anywhere in base 
camp. By evening he still had not 
returned. Eisensent me to Chaney s 
hut and told me to spend the night 
there. He told me to go through 
Chaney* s belongings arid to see if I 
could determine his whereabouts 
either from an explicit note or a 
random scrawl. '7 dont think he*ll 
be back,** the captain said — and the 
captain was right. He was wrong 
about the note, though. I found 
nothing but battered notebooks in 
his book-littered cubicle. And 
though I read through all of these 
that night, I found no farewell note. 

It was not until I checked my 
mail box the next day that I found 
what Eisen had told me to look for. 
I checked the box merely out of 
habit — I knew there had been no 
probeship deliveries. Perhaps / was 
looking for a memo from one of the 
base campers. And I found the note 
from Chaney. The only comfort it 
gave me was the comfort of 
knowing that my friend had not de- 
cided to commit suicide and that he 
had successfully fought off a subtle 
but steadily encroaching madness. 

(Eisen read this last sentence in 
rough draft and took exception to 
it: ** Now you* re dead wrong, Ben. 
Chaney not only succumbed to his 
madness but he committed suicide 
as well — a slow suicide, but suicide 



nevertheless.** } The note expressed 
a peculiar sort of optimism, I think, 
and if you dont see this slender af- 
firmative thread when you first 
read through the note, go back and 
read the damn thing again. Because 
even if Chaney did commit suicide 
he died for something he believed 
in. 

I’m going back to the Asadi 
clearing, Ben. But don’t come 
after me — I won’t let you bring 
me back. I’ve reached a perfect 
accommodation with myself. 
Probably I’ll die. Without the 
supply drops I’m sure I will. 
But I belong among the Asadi, 
not as an outcast and not as a 
chieftain — but as one of the 
milling throng. I belong there 
even though that throng is 
stupid, even though it persists 
in its self-developed immunity 
to instruction. I’m one of them. 

Like The Bachelor, I’m a 
great slow moth. A tiger-moth. 
And the flame I choose to 
pursue and die in is the same 
hame that slowly consumes 
every one of the Asadi. 

Good health to you, 
Egan

CONSTRUaiON 

SHACK 

CLIFFORD D.SIMAK 



I N THAT same year when men 
first walked on Mars the probe 
was launched from the moon for 
Pluto. Five years later the first pic- 
tures were transmitted as the or- 
biting probe trained its cameras on 
the planet’s surface. The trans- 
mission quality was poor; but even 
so, certain features of the pho- 
tographs were productive of great 



69 



anguish as old theories fell to 
shards and were replaced by puz- 
zlement, questions with no hint of 
answers. The pictures seemed to 
say that the planet had a smooth, 
almost polished surface, without a 
single geographic feature to break 
the smoothness of it. Except that at 
certain places, equidistant from one 
another along the equator, were 
tiny dotS“ that would have been 
taken for transmission noise if they 
had not appeared consistently. Too, 
the dots still persisted when some of 
the noise was eliminated. So it 
seemed they must be small geogra- 
phic features or shadows cast by 
geographic features, although at 
Pluto’s distance from the sun 
shadows would be suspect. The 
other data did nothing to lessen the 
anguish. The planet was smaller 
than supposed, less than a thousand 
miles in diameter, and its density 
worked out to 3.5 grams per cubic 
centimeter rather than the un- 
realistic figure of 60 grams, pre- 
viously supposed. 

This meant several things. It 
meant that somewhere out there, 
perhaps something more than seven 
billion miles from the sun, a tenth 
planet of the solar system swung in 
orbit, for no planet the size and 
mass of Pluto could explain the ec- 
centricities in the orbits of Uranus 
and Neptune. The calculation of 
Pluto’s mass, now proved inaccu- 



rate, had been based on the 
measurement of those eccentricities 
and it must be admitted now that 
something else must account for 
them. 

Beyond that, Pluto was most 
strange — a smooth planet, fea- 
tureless except for the evenly 
spaced dots. The smoothness cer- 
tainly could not -be explained by a 
non-turbulent atmosphere, for 
surely Pluto had to be too small and 
cold to hold an atmosphere. A sur- 
face of ice, men wondered, the 
frozen remnants of a one-time, mo- 
mentary atmosphere? But for a 
number of reasons that didn’t seem 
right, either. Metal, perhaps, but if 
the planet were of solid metal the 
density should be far greater. 

The men on Earth consoled 
themselves. In five more years the 
probe would come back to Earth, 
carrying with it the films that it had 
takert^ and from them, the actual 
films and not the low-quality tran- 
missions, perhaps much that was 
hazy now might become under- 
standable. The probe swung in its 
measured orbits and sent back 
more pictures, although they were 
little help, for the quality still was 
poor. Then it fired the automatic 
sequence that would head it back to 
Earth, and its beeping signals from 
far out in space said it was headed 
home on a true and steady course. 

Something happened. The 



70 



IF 




beeping stopped and there was a 
silence. Moon base waited. It might 
start up again. The silence might 
indicate only a momentary 
malfunction and the signals might 
start again. But they never did. 
Somewhere, some three billion 
miles from the sun, some mishap 
had befallen the homing probe. It 
was never heard again — it was lost 
forever. 

There was no sense in sending out 
another probe until a day when 
technical advances could assure 
better pictures. The technical ad- 
vances would have to be signifi- 
cant — small refinements would do 
little good. 

The second and third manned 
expeditions went to Mars^nd came 
home again, bringing back, among 
many other things, evidence that 
primitive forms of life existed there, 
which settled once for all the old, 
dark suspicion that life might be an 
aberration to be found only on the 
Earth. For with life on two planets 
in the same solar system there 
could no longer be any doubt that 
life was a common factor in the 
universe. The fourth expedition 
went out, landed and did not come 
back again and now there was on 
Mars a piece of ground that was. 
forever Earth. The fifth expedition 
was sent out even while the Earth 
still paid tribute to those four men 
who had died so far from home. 



Now that life had been found on 
another world, now that it was ap- 
parent that another planet at one 
time hacfbeld seas and rivers and an 
atmosphere that had been an ap- 
proximation of Earth’s own at- 
mosphere, now that we knew we no 
longer were alone in the universe, 
the public interest and support of 
space travel revived. Scientists, 
remembering (never having, in fact, 
forgotten, for it had gnawed 
steadily at their minds) the puz- 
zlement of the Pluto probe, began 
to plan a manned Pluto expedition, 
as there was still no sense in 
sending an instrumented probe. 

W HEN the day came to lift 
from the Moon Base, I was a 
member of the expedition. I went 
along as a geologist — the last 
thing a Pluto expedition needed. 

There were three of us and any 
psychologist will tell you that three 
is a number that is most unfortu- 
nate. Two gang up on one or ignore 
one and there is always competition 
to be one of the gang of two. No 
one wants to stand alone with the 
other two against him. But it didn’t 
work that way with u^. We got 
along all right, although there were 
times when it was rough going. The 
five years that the probe took to ar- 
rive at Pluto was cut by more than 
half, not only because of improved 
rocket capability, but because a 



CONSTRUCTION SHACK 



71 




manned craft could pile on velocity 
that couldn’t be programed — or at 
least safely programed — into a 
probe. But a bit more than two 
years is a long time to be cooped up 
in a tin can rocketing along in emp- 
tiness. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad 
if you had some sense of speed, of 
really getting somewhere — but you 
haven’t. You just hang there in 
space. 

The three of us? Well, I am 
Howard Hunt and the other two 
were Orson Gates, a chemist, and 
Tyler Hampton, an engineer. 

As I say, we got along fine. We 
played chess tournaments — yeah, 
three men in a tournament and it 
was' all right because none of us 
knew chess. If we had been any 
good I suppose we would have been 
at one another’s throats. We 
dreamed up dirty ditties and were 
so pleased with our accomplish- 
ments that we’d spend hours 
singing them and none of us could 
sing. We did a lot of other futile 
things — by now you should be get- 
ting the idea. There were some 
rather serious scientific experi- 
ments and observations we were 
supposed to make, but all of us 
figured that our first and biggest 
job was to manage to stay sane. 

When we neared Pluto we drop- 
ped the fooling around and spent 
much time peering through the 
scope, arguing and speculating 



about what we saw. Not that there 
was much to see. The planet resem- 
bled nothing quite as much as a 
billiard ball. It was smooth. There 
were no mountains, no valleys, no 
craters — nothing marred, the 

smoothness of the surface. The dots 
were there, of course. We could 
make out seven groups of them, all 
positioned along the equatorial 
belt. And in close up they were not 
simply dots. They were structures 
of some kind. 

We landed finally, near a group 
of them. The landing was a little 
harder than we had figured it would 
be. The planetary surface was 
hard — there was no give to it. But 
we stayed right-side up and we 
didn’t break a thing. 

F ^EOPLE at times ask me to 
describe Pluto and it’s a hard 
thing to put into words. You can 
say that it is smooth and that it’s 
dark — it’s dark even in broad day- 
light. The sun, at that distance, is 
not niuch more than a slightly 
brighter star. You don’t have day- 
light on Pluto — you have starlight 
and it doesn’t make much dif- 
ference whether you’re facing the 
sun or not. The planet is airless, of 
course, and waterless and cold. But 
cold, as far as human sensation is 
concerned, is a relative thing. Once 
the temperature gets down to a 
hundred Kelvin it doesn’t much 



72 



IF 




matter how much colder it be- 
comes. Especially when you’re 
wearing life support. Without a suit 
containing life support you’d last 
only a few seconds, if that long, on 
a place like Pluto. I’ve never 
figured out which would kill you 
first — cold or internal pressure. 
Would you freeze — or explode be- 
fore you froze.? 

So Pluto is dark, airless, cold and 
smooth. Those are the externals 
only. You stand there and look at 
the sun and realize how far away 
you are. You know you are 
standing at the edge of the solar 
system, that just out there, a little 
way beyond, you’d be clear outside 
the system. Which d^sn’t really 
have to be true, of course. You 
know about the tenth planet. Even 
if it’s theory, it’s supposed to be out 
there. You know about the millions 
of circling comets that technically 
are a part of the solar system, al- 
though they’re so far out no one 
ever thinks of them. You could say 
to yourself this really is not the 
edge — the hypothetical tenth planet 
and the comets still are out there. 
But this is intellectualization; 
you’re telling yourself something 
that your mind says may be true, 
but your gut denies. For hundreds 
of years Pluto hasj^en the last out- 
post and this, by God, is Pluto and 
you’re farther away from home 
than man has ever been before and 



you feel it. You don’t belong to 
anything any more. You’re in the 
back alley, and the bright and 
happy streets are so far away that 
you know you’ll never find them. 

It isn’t homesickness that you 
feel. It’s more like never having had 
a home. Of never having belonged 
anywhere. You get over it, of 
course — or come to live with it. 

So we came down out of the ship 
after we had landed and stood upon 
the surface. The first thing that 
struck us — other than the sense of 
lostness that at once grabbed all of 
us — was that the horizon was too 
near, much nearer than on the 
Moon. We felt at once that we 
stood on a small world. We noticed 
that horizon’s nearness even before 
we noticed the buildings that the 
probe had photographed as dots 
and that we had dropped down to 
investigate. Perhaps buildings is 
not the right word — structures 
probably would be better. Buildings 
are enclosures and these were not 
enclosures. They were domes 
someone had set out to build and 
hadn’t had time to finish. The basic 
underlying framework had been 
erected and then the work had stop- 
ped. Riblike arcs curved up from 
the surface, and met overhead. 
Struts and braces held the frarhes 
solid, but that was as far as the 
construction had gone. There were 
three of them, one larger than the 



CONSTRUCTION SHACK 



73 




other two. The frames were not 
quite as sitnple as I may have made 
them seem. Tied into the ribs and 
struts and braces were a number of 
other structural units that seemed 
to have no purpose and make no 
sense at all. 

We tried to make sense out of 
them and out of the scooped-out 
hollows that had been gouged out 
of the planetary surface within the 
confines of each construct — they 
had no floors and seemed fastened 
to the surface of the planet. The 
hollows were circular, some six feet 
across and three feet deep, and to 
me they looked like nothing quite 
as much as indentations made in a 
container of ice cream by a scoop. 

Abput this time Tyler began to 
have some thoughts about the sur- 
face. Tyler is an engineer and 
should have had his thoughts im- 
mediately — and so should the rest 
of us — but the first hour or so out- 
side the ship had been considerably 
confusing. We had worn our suits in 
training, of course, and had done 
some walking around in them, but 
Pluto seemed to have even less 
gravity than had been calculated 
and we had had to get used to it be- 
fore we could be reasonably com- 
fortable. Nor had anything else 
been exactly as we had anticipated. 

“This surface,” Tyler said to me. 
“There is something wrong with 
it.” 



“We knew it was smooth,” said 
Orson. “The pictures showed that. 
Coming in, we could see it for our- 
selves.” 

“This smooth?” Tyler asked. 
“This even?” He turned to me. “It 
isn't geologically possible. Would 
you say it is?” 

“I would think not,” T said. “If 
there had been any upheaval at all 
this floor would be rugged. There 
can’t have been any erosion — 
anything to level it down. Microme- 
teorite impacts, maybe, but not too 
many of them. We’re too far out for 
meteorites of any size. And while 
micrometeorites might pit the sur- 
face there would be no leveling 
process.” 

T yler let himself down on his 
knees rather awkwardly. He 
brushed a hand across the surface. 
The seeing was not too good, but 
you could see that there was dust, a 
thin layer of dust, a powdering. 

“Shine a light down here,” said 
Tyler. 

Orson aimed his light at the spot. 
Some of the gray ,dust still clung 
where Tyler had wiped his hand, 
but there were streaks where the 
darker surface showed through. 
“Space dust,” said Tyler. 

Orson said, “There should be 
damn little of it.” 

“True,” said Tyler. “But over 
four billion years or more, it would

IF 




accumulate. It couldn't be erosion 
dust, could it?” 

“Nothing to cause erosion,” I 
said. “This must be as close to a 
dead planet as you ever get. Not 
enough gravity to hold any of the 
gases — if there ever were gases. At 
one time there must have been, but 
they’ve all gone — they went early. 
No atmosphere, no water. 1 doubt 
there ever was any accumulation. A 
molecule wouldn’t hang around for 
long.” 

“But space dust would?” 

“Maybe. Some sort of electro- 
static attraction, maybe.” 

Tyler scrubbed the little patch of 
surface again with his gloved hand, 
removing more of the dust, with 
more of the darker surface showing 
through. 

“Have we got a drill?” he asked. 
“A specimen drill.” 

“I have one in my kit,” said 
Orson. He took it out and handed it 
to Tyler. Tyler positioned the bit 
against the surface, pressed the but- 
ton. In the light of the torch you 
could see the bit spinning. Tyler put 
more weight on the drill. 

“It’s harder than a bitch,” he 
said. 

The bit began to bite. A small 
pile of fragments built up around 
the hole. The surface was hard, no 
doubt of that. The bit didn’t go too 
deep and the pile of fragments was 
small. 



Tyler gave up. He lifted out the 
bit and snubbed off the motor. 
“Enough for analysis?” he asked. 
“Should be,” said Orson. He 
took the bit from Tyler and handed 
him a small specimen bag. Tyler 
laid the open mouth of the bag on 
the surface and brushed the frag- 
ments into it. 

“Now we’ll know,” he said. 
“Now we will know something.” 

A couple of hours later, back in 
the ship, we knew. 

“I have it,” Orson said, “but I 
don’t believe it.” 

“Metal?” asked Tyler. 

“Sure, metal. But not the kind 
you have in mind. It’s steel.” 
“Steel?” I said, horrified. “It 
can’t be. Steel’s no natural metal. 
It’s tnanufactured.” 

“Iron,” said Orson. “Nickel. 
Molybdenum, vanadium, chro- 
mium. That works out to steeL I 
don’t know as much about steel as I 
should. But it’s steel — a good steel. 
Corrosion resistant, tough, strong.” 
“Maybe just the platform for the 
structures,” I said. “Maybe a pad 
of steel to support them. We took 
the specimen close to one of them.” 
“Let’s find out,” said Tyler. 

We opened up the garage and ran 
down the ramp and got out the 
buggy. Before we left we turned off 
the television camera. By this time 
Moon Base would have seen all 
they needed to see and if they 



CONSTRUCTION SHACK 



75 




wanted more they could ask for it. 
We had given them a report on 
everything we had found — all ex- 
cept the steel surface and the three 
of us agreed that until we knew 
more about that we would not say 
anything. It would be a while in any 
case until we got an answer from 
them. The time lag to Earth was 
about sixty hours each way. 

We went out ten miles and took a 
boring sample and came back, 
following the thin tracks the buggy 
made in the dust, taking samples 
every mile. We got the answer that 
I think all of us expected we would 
get, but couldn’t bring ourselves to 
talk about. The samples all were 
steel. 

It didn’t seem possible, of course, 
and it took us a while to digest the 
fact, but finally we admitted that on 
the basis of best evidence Pluto was 
no planet, but a fabricated metal 
ball, small-planet size. But God- 
awful big for anyone to build. 

Anyone? 



T hat was the question that 
now haunted us. Who had built 
it? Perhaps more important — why 
had they built it? For some purpose, 
surely, but why, once that purpose 
had been fulfilled (if, in fact, it had 
been fulfilled) had Pluto been left 
out here at the solar system’s rim? 
“No one from the system,” Tyler 



said. “There’s no one but us. Mars 
has life, of cours^e, but primitive 
life. It got a start there and hung on 
and that was all. Venus is too hot. 
Mercury is too close to the sun. The 
big gas planets? Maybe, but not the 
kind of life that would build a thing 
like this. It had to be something 
from outside.” 

“How about the fifth planet?” 
suggested Orson. 

“There probably never was a fifth 
planet,” I said. “The material for it 
may have been there, but the planet 
never formed. By all the rules of ce- 
lestial mechanics there should have 
been a planet between Mars and 
Jupiter, but something went 
haywire.” 

“The tenth planet, then,” said 
Orson. 

“No one is really positive there is 
a tenth,” said Tyler. 

“Yeah, you’re right,” said Orson. 
“Even if there were it would be a 
poor bet for life, let alone in- 
telligence.” 

“So that leaves us with out- 
siders,” said Tyler. 

“And a long time ago,” said 
Orson. 

“Why do you say that?” 

“The dust. There isn’t much dust 
in the universe.” 

“And no one knows what it is. 
There is the dirty ice theory.” 

“I see what you’re getting at. But 
it needn’t be ice. Nor graphite nor 



76 



IF 




any of the other things that have 
been—” ^ 

‘‘You mean it’s that stuff out 
there.” 

“It could be. What do you think, 
Howard?” 

“I can’t be sure,” I said, “The 
only thing I know is that it couldn’t 
be erosive.” 

Before we went to sleep we tried 
to fix up a report to beam back to 
Moon Base, but anything we put 
together sounded too silly and un- 
believable. So we gave up. We’d 
have to tell them some time, but we 
could wait. 

When we awoke we had a bite to 
eat, then got into our suits and went 
out to look ovef the structures. 
They still didn’t make much sense, 
especially all the crazy contraptions 
that were fastened on the ribs and 
struts and braces. Nor did the 
scooped-out hollows. 

“If they were only up on legs,” 
said Orson, “they could be used as 
chairs.” 

“But not very comfortable,” said 
Tyler. 

“If you tilted .them a bit,” said 
Orson. But that didn’t figure either. 
They would still be uncomfortable. 
I wondered why he thought of them 
as chairs. They didn’t look like any 
chairs to me. 

We pottered around a lot, not 
getting anywhere. We looked the 
structures over inch by inch, 



wondering all the while if there was 
something we had missed. But there 
didn’t seem to be. 

Now comes the funny part of it. I 
don’t know why we did it — out of 
sheer desperation, maybe. But 
failing to find any clues, we got 
down on our hands and knees, 
dusting at the surface with our 
hands. What we hoped to find, I 
don’t know. It was slow going and 
it was a dirty business, with the dust 
tending to stick to us. 

“If we’d only brought some 
brooms along,” said Orson. 

But we had no brooms. Who in 
his right mind would have thought 
we would want to sweep a planet? 

S O THERE we were. We had 
what appeared to be a manufac- 
tured planet and we had some 
stupid structures for which we 
could deduce not a single reason. 
We had come a long ways and we 
had been expected to make some 
tremendous discovery once we 
landed. We had made a discovery, 
all right, but it didn’t mean a thing. 

We finally gave up with the 
sweeping business and stood there, 
scuffing our feet and wondering 
what to do next when Tyler sud- 
denly let out a yell and pointed at a 
place on the surface where his boots 
had kicked away the dust. 

We all bent to look at what he 
had found. We saw three holes in 



CONSTRUCTION SHACK- 



77 




the surface, each an inch or so 
across and some three inches deep, 
placed in a triangle and close 
together. Tyler got down on his 
hands and knees and shone his light 
down into the holes, each one of 
them in turn. 

Finally he stood up. “I don’t 
know,” he said. “They could maybe 
be a lock of some sort. Like a com- 
bination. There are little notches on 
the sides, down at the bottom of 
them. If you moved those notches 
just right something might hap- 
pen. 

“Might blow ourselves up, 
maybe,” said Orson. “Do it wrong 
and bang!” 

“I don’t think so,” said Tyler. “I 
don’t think it’s anything like that. 1 
don’t say it’s a lock, either. But I 
don’t think it’s a bomb. Why 
should they boobytrap a thing like 
this?” 

“You can’t tell what they might 
have done,” I said. “We don’t 
know what kind of things they were 
or why they were here.” 

Tyler didn’t answer. He got down 
again and began carefully dusting 
the surface, shining his light on it 
while he dusted. We didn’t have 
anything else to do, so helped him. 

It was Orson who found it this 
time — a hairline crack you had to 
hold your face down close to the 
surface to see. Having found it, we 
did some more dusting and worried 



it out. The hairline described a 
circle and the three holes were set 
inside and to one edge of it. The 
circle was three feet or so in dia- 
meter. 

“Either of you guys good at 
picking locks?” asked Tyler. 

Neither of us were. 

“It’s got to be a hatch of some 
sort,” Orson said. “This metal ball 
we’re standing on has to be a 
hollow ball. If it weren’t its mass 
would be greater than it is.” 

“And no one,” I said, “would be 
insane enough to build a solid ball. 
It would take too much metal and 
too much energy to move.” 

“You’re sure that it was moved?” 
asked Orson. 

“It had to be,” I told him. “It 
wasn’t built in this system. No one 
here could have built it.” 

Tyler had pulled a screwdriver 
out of his toolkit and was poking 
into the hole with it. 

“Wait a minute,” said Orson. “I 
just thought of something.” 

He nudged Tyler to one side, 
reached down and inserted three 
fingers into the holes and pulled. 
The circular section rose smoothly 
on its hinges. 

Wedged into the area beneath the 
door were objects that looked like 
the rolls of paper you buy to wrap 
up Christmas presents. Bigger than 
rolls of paper, though. Six inches or 
so across. 



78 



IF 




I got hold of one of them and that 
first one was not easy to grip, for 
they were packed in tightly. But I 
managed with much puffing and 
grunting to pull it out. It was heavy 
and a good four feet in length. 

Once we got one out. the other 
rolls were easier to lift. We pulled 
out three more and headed for the 
ship. 

But before we left 1 held the 
remaining rolls over to one side, to 
keep them from tilting, while Orson 
shone his light down into the hole. 
We had half expected to find a 
screen or something under the rolls, 
with the hole extending on down 
into a cavity that might have been 
used as living quarters or a work- 
room. But the hole ended in ma- 
chined metal. We could see the 
grooves left by the drill or die that 
had bored the hole. That hole had 
just one purpose, to store the rolls 
we had found inside it. 



B ack in the ship we had to wait 
a while for the rolls to pick up 
some heat before we could handle 
them. Even so we had to wear 
gloves when we began to unroll 
them. Now, seeing them in good 
light, we realized that they were 
made up of many sheets rolled up 
together. The sheets seemed to be 
made of some sort of extremely 
thin metal or tough plastic. They 



were stiff from the cold and we 
spread them out on our lone table 
and weighed them down to hold 
them flat. 

On the first sheet were diagrams 
of some sort, drawings and what 
might have been specifications writ- 
ten into the diagrams and along the 
margins. The specifications, of 
course, meant nothing to us (al- 
though later some were puzzled out 
and mathematicians and chemists 
were able to figure out some of the 
formulas and equations). 

“Blueprints,’^’ said Tyler. “This 
whole business was an engineering 
job.’’ 

“If that’s the case,’’ said Orson, 
“those strange things fastened to 
the structural frames could be 
mounts to hold engineering instru- 
ments.’’ 

“Could be,’’ said Tyler. 

“Maybe the instruments are 
stored in some other holes like the 
one where we found the blue- 
prints,’’ I suggested. 

“I don’t think so,’’ said Tyler. 
“They would have taken the instru- 
ments with them when they left.’’ 

“Why didn’t they take the blue- 
prints, too?’’ 

“The instruments would have 
been worthwhile to take. They 
could be used on another job. But 
the blueprints couldn’t. And there 
may have been many sets of prints 
and spec sheets. These we have may 



CONSTRUCTION SHACK 



79 




be only one of many sets of dupli- 
cates. There would have been a set 
of master prints and those they 
might have taken with them when 
they left.” 

“What I don’t understand,” I 
said, “is what they could have been 
building out here. What kind of 
construction? And why here? I sup- 
pose we could think of Pluto as a 
massive construction shack, but 
why exactly here? With all the 
galaxy to pick from, why this par- 
ticular spot?” 

“You ask too many questions all 
at once,” Orson told me. 

“Let’s look,” said Tyler. “Maybe 
we’ll find out.” 

He peeled the first sheet off the 
top and let it drop to the floor. It 
snapped back to the rolled-up 
position. 

The second sheet told us nothing, 
nor did the third or fourth. Then 
came the fifth sheet. 

“Now, here is something,” said 
Tyler. 

We leaned close to look. 

“It’s the solar system,” Orson 
said. 

i counted rapidly. “Nine 
planets.” 

“Where’s the tenth?” asked 
Orson. “There should be a tenth.” 

“Something’s wrong,” said 
Tyler. “I don’t know what it is.” 

I spotted it. “There’s a planet 
between Mars and Jupiter.” 



“That means there is no Pluto 
shown,” said Orson. 

“Of course noU” said Tyler. 
“Pluto never was a planet.” 

“Then this means there once ac- 
tually was a planet between Mars^ 
and Jupiter,” said Orson. 

“Not necessarily,” Tyler told 
him. “It may only mean there was 
supposed to be.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“They^ bungled the job,” said 
Tyler. “They did a sloppy piece of 
engineering.” 

“You’re insane!” 1 shouted at 
him. 

“Your blind spot is showing, 
Howard. According to what we 
think, perhaps it is insane. Ac- 
cording to the theories our physi- 
cists have worked out. There is a 
cloud of dust and gas and the cloud 
contracts to form a protostar. Our 
scientists have invoked a pretty set 
of physical laws to calculate what 
happens. Physical laws that were 
automatic — since no one would be 
mad enough to postulate a gang of 
cosmic engineers who went about 
the universe building solar sys- 
tems.” 

“But the tenth planet,” persisted 
Orson. “There has to be a tenth 
planet. A big, massive — ” 

“They messed up the projected 
fifth planet,” Tyler said. “God 
knows what else they messed up. 
Venus, maybe. Venus shouldn’t be 



80 



IF 




the kind of planet it is. It should be 
another Earth, perhaps a slightly 
warmer Earth, but not the hellhole 
it is. And Mars. They loused that 
up, too. Life started there, but it 
never had a chance. It hung on and 
that was all. And Jupiter, Jupiter is 
a monstrosity — ” 

“You thihk the only reason for a 
planet’s existence is its capability of 
supporting life?” 

“I don’t know, of course. But it 
should be in the specs. Three 
planets that could have been life- 
bearing and of these only one was 
successful.” 

“Then,” said Orson, “there could 
be a tenth planet. One that wasn’t 
even planned.” 

Tyler wrapped his fist against the 
sheet. “With a gang of clowns like 
this anything could happen.” 

He jerked away the sheet and 
tossed it to the floor. 

“There!” he cried. “Look here.” 

We crowded in and looked. 

It was a cross section, ^or ap- 
peared to be a cross section, of a 
planet. 

“A central core,” said Tyler. “An 
atmosphere — ” 

“Earth?” 

“Could be. Could be Mars or 
Venus.” 

The sheet was covered with what 
could have been spec notations. 

“It doesn’t look quite right,” I 
protested. 



“It wouldn’t if it were Mars or 
Venus. And how sure are you of 
Earth?” 

“Not sure at all,” I said. 

He jerked away the sheet to re- 
veal another one. 

We puzzled over it. 

“Atmospheric profile,” 1 guessed 
half-heartedly. 

“These are just general specs,” 
said Tyler. “The details will be in 
some of the other rolls. We have a 
lot of them out there.” 

I tried to envision it. A construc- 
tion shack set down in a cloud of 
dust and gas. Engineers who may 
have worked for millennia to put 
together star and planets, to key 
into them certain factors that still 
would be at work, billions of years 
later. 

Tyler said they had bungled and 
perhaps they had. But maybe not 
with Venus. Maybe Venus had been 
built to different specifications. 
Maybe it had been designed to be 
the way it was. Perhaps, a billion 
years from now, when humanity 
might well be gone from Earth, a 
new life and a new intelligence 
would rise on Venus. 

Maybe not with Venus, maybe 
with none of the others, either. We 
could not pretend to know. 

Tyler was still going through the 
sheets. 

“Look here,” he was yelling. 
“Look here — the bunglers — ” •

THE 

NEVER 

GIRL 

MICHAEL G. CONEY 




S HE walked quietly through the 
deserted dawn streets of 
Axminster and the black mutated 
Alsatian padded with equal silence 
at her heels. Despite the early Sep- 
tember chill she was warm, too 
warm in her light coat, and was 
prespiring nervously as she hurried 
close to the concrete walls. She 
paused at each corner, glancing to 
left and right, then running sound- 
lessly across the exposed areas, the 
Alsatian following with slow 
bounds. She looked about fifteen 
years old — it was hardly possible 
that she was that age, but she might 
have been a hundred and thirty- 
four or a hundred and seventy. 



As she passed the gaunt face of 
the Creche she saw the figure of a 
nurse in one of the windows, sil- 
houetted against the lighted room. 
She envied the nurse — envied her 
job, her freedom from fear, her se- 
curity — the nurse, she thought, is 
one of the Establishment and 
therefore safe. 

She walked on. 

Later she paused at the spacious 
entrance to a large building that 
towered to the crimson-streaked 
gray sky and, without much hope, 
tried the wide glass doors. They 
were, of course, locked. Above 
them a large sign read: transfer 
CENTER. A smaller sign below

exhorted her to take a friend 
and at this she directed a nervous 
smile, one shift from terror. She 
moved away and, a few yards up 
the street, slipped down a narrow 
passage, dark and featureless ex- 
cept for the dim outline of a small 
window in the tall walls. She 
regarded this for a moment, 
gauging the height. 

“Wait here,” she whispered. The 
dog sat back on it haunches, tongue 
lolling. 

She jumped, caught the sill, hung 
for a moment one-handed as she 
pushed at the glass. She felt it yield 
and pulled herself up, rocked for- 
ward on her wrists and butted the 



THE NEVER GIRL 



hinged window open. She swung 
her legs over the edge and sat for a 
moment flashing her torch around 
the interior. Satisfied, she dropped 
through, landing lightly on her feet, 
and played the beam around the 
large room in which she found 
herself. 

“Who’s there?” The question was 
harsh and metallic. “Is that you, 
Man Ewell? Come and talk to me 
for a moment, will you? I’m bored. 
These lazy bastards have all gone 
comatose.” 

The girl did not reply. Holding 
her breath, she pointed the torch at 
the source of the voice. The op- 
posite wall was completely taken up 



83 




by a stack of boxes, each a cube of 
about one foot, enameled black and 
with a grille in the side facing her. 
There must have been a thousand of 
them and she knew that behind the 
wall of boxes were another thou- 
sand — and another and another. 
The voice was issuing from the 
right-hand side of the stack. Queru- 
lous, it spoke again. “Are you 
there? Are you there?” 

Another voice replied amid a 
communal rasping as the other 
boxes roused themselves. 

“There’s nobody there. Be quiet, 
will you? I was almost asleep. God, 
I had almost made it for the first 
time. Then you had to start 
shouting.” 

“I tell you I heard somebody. 1 
can hear him now. Breathing.” 

“Imagination. When you’ve been 
in a box as long as I have you’ll 
learn to distinguish. It’s difficult at 
first. I’ll grant you.” This was 
another box, down toward the left- 
hand bottom corner of the 
stack — the voice was more sympa- 
thetic. 

“Sorry — ” The first speaker still 
sounded doubtful, but becariie 
silent. The various mutterings 
ceased and the room was quiet 
again. 

The girl tiptoed across it to a 
large card index set in the wall. 
She quickly ran her finger down the 
exposed edges of the cards, paused 
and extracted one. She read the 
punched information carefully, 
then pocketed the card and mov^ 



back to the window. She turned, 
played the torch over the boxes 
once more, then snapped out the 
light and climbed to the sill. 

She dropped lightly to the ground 
outside — the Alsatian approached 
eagerly to lick her hand. 

Trembling, she brushed the hair 
from her face. Her hand came away 
wet with tears. 

I INTON JAMES looked up as 
^ the tall android entered the 
Transfer Center. The sound of traf- 
fic outside died, as the door swung 
shut. 

“ ’Morning, Man Ewell.” 

“Good morning, James.’^ Phillip 
Ewell paused at the reception desk. 
“Where’s the secretary?” 

“Late as usual. I’m standing in 
for a moment until she arrives.” 

The android sighed. “I’ll get 
Johnson to have a word with her. 
How many cases have I got this 
morning?” 

“Ten — sir.” The polite address 
stuck in James’ gullet — he detested 
having an android as a superior. 
Not that Ewell wasn’t good at his 
job. James conceded that in the few 
days since the new Transfer Sur- 
geon arrived at Axminster Center 
he had already proved his worth. 
Every operation had been com- 
pletely successful. But Ewell would 
not confine his sphere of actvity to 
the operating theater. The man had 
a habit of popping up like a genie 
at unexpected moments — James 
would find him at his shoulder as he

IF 




lolled unsuspecting in his chair, 
reading the paper. The android 
seemed to be everywhere, reor- 
ganizing, criticizing, issuing direc- 
-tives. He was a worker. He had al- 
ready looked in at the Creche this 
morning, James guessed. Such de- 
votion to his patients was odd. 

“All reincorporations?” Ewell 
was asking. 

“Eight reincorps, two direct 
Transfers. A few disincorps, too.” 

Ewell bit his lip thoughtfully. 
James’s report accounted for all 
available hosts of the right age in 
the Creche. If an emergency turned 
up Ewell might have to use an an- 
droid baby. He turned away and 
made for the corridor. 

“Let me know when the sec gets 
here, will you?” he called over his 
shoulder, and Linton James made a 
face at the broad, retreating back. 

As soon as the surgeon was out of 
sight, the glass entrance door swung 
open and the receptionist entered, 
looking flustered. She hurried 
across to the desk. 

“Is Man Ewell hfere yet?” 

James eyed her appreciatively be- 
fore answering. In her haste she had 
gained an attractive flush and she 
was looking up at him anxiously, in 
sharp contrast to her normal so- 
phisticated disinterest. He savored 
the moment. 

“He’s here,” he replied at last. 
“HI put in a good word for you if 
you like.” 

The girl was not at all fooled by 
this. 



She sniffed, brushed past him and 
sat down at the desk, exposing a 
length of thigh. Linton James hung 
around, eyeing her covertly, 
weighing his chances. She was 
eighteen physical years old, two 
years younger than himself. Her 
last Transfer had been a fortunate 
one — she had a delectable figure 
and face. But she had ambitions. 
She was studying for a Preferred 
Trade and considered herself above 
him. 

He sighed and turned away, in- 
tending to go to his small office at 
the end of the corridor, when his at- 
tention was caught by the entrance 
door’s swinging open again. A 
young girl came in hesitantly, a car- 
rier dog at her heels. She stood in 
the center of the entrance hall, 
looking about uncertainly, saw 
James watching and approached 
him with a nervous smilp. He ran a 
hand over his hair and smiled back. 

“May I help you?” he asked. Be- 
hind him the receptionist sniffed 
again. 

The girl looked scared. She was 
about fifteen physical years old. 
Her eyes were large, blue and 
strangely innocent. As he looked at 
her he felt a pulse begin to beat 
thickly in his throat. She wore a 
light coat, open at the front to af- 
ford a glimpse of delicious young 
breasts maturing beneath a tight 
dress. 

Staring at him like a terrified 
leveret she asked; “Is this the 
Transfer Center?”

“It is,” replied James, still 
smiling. 

“This is where I can contract to 
take Friends?” 

“That’s right.” She could read, 
couldn’t she? Obvjously she was a 
stranger in these parts. He won- 
dered if she wanted to be shown 
around the town. 

“Oh, good. I want to take two 
Friends, please.” She withdrew a 
slip of paper from the pocket of her 
coat and James had the undefinable 
notion that she was somehow acting 
a part. He glanced at the recep- 
tionist, who seemed intent on 
reading something, head bent. 

“Right,” said James briskly. “I 
can deal with that for you. Just fill 
in this form and I’ll bring you a 
couple of Friends from the 
Habitation Room.” He took a 
sheet of paper from the stack on the 
counter and placed it before her. He 
handed her a pen, standing close. 
Her head was level with his 
shoulder. His hip brushed against 
her. JJe had a powerful urge to put 
his arm around her. 



H e had been in trouble before. 

Two physical lives ago, at the 
age of twenty, he had given way to 
his desires in the public park one 
night. By the dark walls of the an^ 
dent Minster he had come across a 
lone woman, a criminal convicted 
on a theft charge and with only one 
year to go before Total Death. She 
had confided this to him as they 



leaned against the wall together, he 
listening sympathetically while his 
mind assessed the possibilities. But 
he had miscalculated and the 
woman had begun to scream when 
he made his rough, uncontrolled 
advances. So he had run and lived 
in terror for two days, watching the 
indicator boards every minute in 
fear that his name would appear as 
a wanted man. No doubt the 
woman had reported the inci- 
dent — herself bitter, she had 
wanted to take someone with her to 
the Euthanasia Room. 

But the police had been unable to 
track him down. The night had 
been dark. They had not exchanged 
indentities — her description had 
been incomplete. And, possibly, the 
police had not had much sympathy 
for her. So he had gotten away with 
it. He had been more careful since. 

The girl was regarding him with 
dismay, her face close to his. 

^ “Can’t I choose my own Friends?” 
she queried. 

“You have someone specific you 
wish to take?” 

“Yes.” She consulted the slip she 
had brought. “A-21867-AX and A- 
24536- AX, please.” 

“Anything to oblige.” He 
dragged his eyes away from hers. 
“Just fill in this form,” he 
instructed. “I’ll go and get the 
Friends.” He took the slip of paper 
from her, contriving to touch her 
hand lightly at the same time, then 
made his way to the Habitation 
Room. This was situated at the ex-

treme end of the corridor— it was a 
vast rectangular chamber, some- 
thing like a library filled by parallel 
stacks of Friends. 

The Conversationalist sat among 
the boxes, trying to interest the 
Friends in history. James paused in 
the doorway. 

“The Compulsory Transfer Act 
was passed in the year 2056,”* the 
man was saying, “with the dual ob- 
ject of reducing the runaway 
birthrate and preventing the 
wastage of active, valuable minds 
through death. This law might 
fairly be said to have changed the 
face of civilization.” 

“I’lr say,” rasped one of the 
Friends. “If not for that law I’d 
have a physical body now — instead 
of being in this damned box!” The 



* The Act of 2056 guaranteed virtually 
everyone then alive immortality. It specified 
that on his/her fiftieth birthday every person 

of Earth had to attend a Transfer Center, 
where his/her brain was removed and placed 
into the craniuiii of a six-month>old child. 
The person then went through another child- 
hood to maturity and the process was 
repeated at his or her fiftieth birthday— 
injiniturrh^ So successful was the Act at 
curbing the human birthrate that by 2066 it 
became necessary to introduce what were 
euphemistically called Friendship boxes 
— metal containers filled with nutrient 
fluid in which a brain was placed pending 
availability of a host body. In order to make 
the wait more pleasant the boxes were equip- 
ped with audio pickups and vocal chords. By 
the year 2128 it was decided to decrease the 
active population (while birthrate had de- 
clined, the number of people had not) by re- 
ducing the age for Compulsory Transfer to 
40. Simultaneously came about the Pre- 
ferred Trade concept, which made it un- 



Conversationalist was frequently 
subjected to such heckling. James 
grinned, leaning against the door 
jamb. 

“Except for the Act you’d have 
been dead this last hundred and 
fifty years.” pointed out the Con- 
versationalist. He leaned forward 
to confirm this. “A-28976-AX,” he 
read from the metal plate above the 
Friend’s grille. “So you had your 
first Transfer about 2085. You’ve 
probably had four physical bodies 
by now, a total of one hundered and 
sixty years active life. And just a 
total of twenty years Friendship in 
a box at various times. That’s not 
bad. We can’t help the Waiting 
List, you know. And Axminster is 
lucky. In some cities the list is over 
ten years long.” 

necessary for **essential personnel,'' such as 
government officials and civil servants, to 
spend any time in a Friendship box — at age 
40 they were transferred into a host body. 

By 2159 old heads were firmly in the sad- 
dle and the world was solidly in the grip of 
the System. Almost no one remembered 
what a young person was. Androids were 
develops to serve as host bodies. Hand- 
some, healthy and intelligent, grown from 
the best genetic material available, they were 
nevertheless discriminated against because 
of certain skin discolorations and most 
people continued to prefer waiting periods in 
Friendship boxes. 

The human birthrate, however, continued 
to drop— and Friends in boxes wielded 
votes. The Total Death Act— which 
prescribed termination of all persons con- 
victed of any offense from overtime parking 
up — was passed in 2176 to shorten Friend- 
ship box waiting period for others. 

The events in this story took place in the 
year 2256.

“Thanks,” said someone sar- 
castically. “That makes me feel 
good. I’ve only got eighteen months 
to do in this box.” 

Linton James coughed. “Excuse 
me,” he said. “I’ve come to collect 
a couple of Friends.” He read the 
numbers out to the Conversa- 
tionalist. The man nodded and 
James began to examine the boxes, 
which were in approximate nu- 
merical order, while the history 
lesson continued. Soon he found the 
two he wanted. “I’ve got them,” he 
said. He took them down and 
checked the numbers off with the 
Conversationalist. 

Harsh outcries rose from several 
Friends as they heard the numbers. 

“Wait a moment!” someone 
yelled. “Those two only came in 
yesterday. How come they’ve found 
Companions already? What about 
me? I’ve been in this room for three 
years!” . 

“I can’t help that.” James ad- 
dressed the box at the foot of the 
stack. “Contracting for Friends by 
active persons is entirely voluntary. 
A girl came in just now and ask^ 
for these two Friends. They’re 
probably acquaintances of hers. If 
she’s good enough to contract to 
look after a Friend she can have 
anyone she likes.” 

The Conversationalist spoke up. 
“One thing I’d like to ask you 
people,” he said. “During your last 
physical life — how many of you 
took the responsibility of 
contracting to look after a Friend?” 



An abashed muttering came from 
the boxes. 

“You see what I mean?” the 
Conversationalist asked trium- 
phantly. “If you wouldn’t take a 
Friend when you could — why 
should anyone take you?” 

Several boxes began to speak at 
once — loudly. James left the room. 
He didn’t envy the Conversation- 
alist his job. For several hours 
each day the man talked to the 
boxes, -^reasoning with them, 
teaching them, listening to their 
complaints... 

I INTON JAMES quickly forgot 
^ the Habitation Room as he 
reached the entrance hall. The girl 
was bending over, her back to him, 
patting the carrier dog on the head 
and talking to it— carrier dogs were 
extremely intelligent and able to 
comprehend simple human speech. 
James could see the girl’s thighs 
below the short skirt almost to her 
buttocks. He paused for a moment, 
involuntarily touching his tongue to 
his lips, then walked across to her. 

“ Your Friends,” he said, placing 
the two boxes on the floor. 

“Oh, thank you.” She handed 
him the form and he glanced at it 
briefly, checking her name with 
that on the Code Card she offered. 
You had to be careful over that sort 
of thing. People had been known to 
put false name and number on a 
form, thereby gaining possession of 
a Friend without revealing their 
true identities. The claimant would

then disappear, resuming his or her 
correct identity in the city. The 
Friend, possibly an old enemy of 
the impostor, might also disappear 
for a while — in many cases to reap- 
pear later on a garbage dump, 
smashed and Totally Dead. 

But this girl was genuine enough. 
Mary Atkinson. He smiled at her 
reassuringly — she still seemed 

nervous. 

“They’re all yours,” he said. 
“Can I help you out with them?” 
“I’ve brought the dog.” 

“No trouble.” The pulse was 
beating again — his palms were 
moist. He glanced at the address on 
the form. “Cliff Cottage, Brans- 
combe. That’s well out in the 
country. Tell you what — ” he was 
speaking fast, eagerly — “I’ll run 
you there in my car. No trouble.” 
He held her gaze — desire fluttered 
at the pit of his stomach. 

“It’s quite all right.” She was 
looking scared again. “I’ll take the 
bus. Thank you very much, sir — ” 
5/>.The eyes were intensely blue. 
James felt powerful, virile, mas- 
terful. A comer of his mind 
returned to the woman in the park. 
He had shown her. He had stifled 
her screaming with the palm of his 
hand. But he had never wanted 
anyone as much as he wanted this 
girl. What was it about her? She 
seemed virginal. An oddity. Almost 
an alien concept. Something one 
read about. 

“No trouble,” he repeated, his 
mouth dry. “The car’s outside.” 



“Thank you very much,” she 
said, “but I’d rather — ” She seized 
one of the boxes and the carrier dog 
took the other in his powerful jaws. 
With another brief, terrified glance 
at him she turned and almost ran 
for the door, the dog trotting be- 
hind her. James watched the two, 
watched the door after they had 
gone. You didn’t get many girls like 
that. Usually women were hard, ex- 
perienced, inaccessible. 

“My God.” The cynical voice of 
the receptionist startled him out of 
his reverie. “I thought you were 
going to lay her on the spot. You’d 
better watch yourself, young Linton 
James. You’re frustrated. You 
ought to grow up.” 

He wheeled hiriously, hating her 
amused look, her thighs, the im- 
possible longings she created in his 
mind and body. Then he recovered, 
eyeing her appraisingly. His stan- 
dards had changed. She represented 
inferior goods, shop-soiled. He 
stared at her contemptuously and, 
to his surprise, she dropped her 
eyes. 

“She was very pretty,” she 
murmured, “Physically a bit 
young — mentally, too I thought. 
Just the type for you, really , Linton. 
I should look her up some time.” 

Amazed and not knowing quite 
what to say — he felt again inex- 
perienced and unable to cope with 
the world around him — Linton 
James returned to his office to 
dream of the young girl with the 
blue eyes.^ 



THE NEVER GIRL

F ive minutes later he was still 
staring at the form in his hand. 
Once again he read it, turned it 
over, read the other side. He was 
unable to understand what he saw. 
The only certainty was that the girl 
had committed an offense. For 
some unknown reason she, in re- 
moving the two Friends, had laid 
herself open to criminal proceed- 
ings and imprisonment — and con- 
sequently, when the date of her 
next Transfer came up in some 
twenty-five years, Total Death. 

The front of the form bore her 
name and address, which he had 
checked with her Code Card, and 
her number — which he had not 
checked. There had not seemed to 
be any need. 

A-24536-AX mary atkinson, 

CLIFF COTTAGE, BRANSCOMBE. 

The usual declaration and her 
signature followed: M. Atkinson. 

On the reverse of the form ap- 
peared the numbers of the two 
Friends she had taken with her. 
A-21867-AX 
A-24536-AX 

The same number appeared on 
both sides of the form. It was im- 
possible. He had checked her name, 
which agreed with her personal 
Code Card. So the number to go 
with her name must have been cor- 
rect. Yet he had also checked the 
numbers on the boxes with the back 
of the form filled in by her. How 
could a person be in two places at 
once? First, physically before him 
and signing a form — and secondly. 



demonstrably in a Friendship box, 
as witness the number? 

It was some time before Linton 
James thought to check the 
Habitation Room. He entered 
quietly and made for the index 
racks. These contained the Code 
Cards handed in by people under- 
going physical euthanasia before 
their minds were placed in Friend- 
ship boxes; the cards provided a 
cross-check with the boxes in the 
Habitation Room. He flipped 
through the cards, ignoring the 
cries of query from the stacked 
boxes were bored again. The Con- 
versationalist was taking a break. 
Some of the cards had the folded 
forms clipped to them, indicating 
that the Friends they represented 
had been contracted for and 
removed from the room. 

Soon he found what he was 
looking for. He pulled out a card. 

A-21867-AX EDGAR GREEN- 
WOOD, CLIFF COTTAGE, BRANS- 
COMBE. 

That took care of one of the 
Friends. He searched further, but 
soon gave up, convinced. There was 
no card for Friend number A- 
24536-AX. There couldn’t be, be- 
cause that was the one the girl had 
shown him. 

She must previously have suc- 
ceeded in removing it from the 
Habitation Room and had used it 
as identity to claim the Friends. 
Why? 

He thought about it for a while, 
sitting in his office. He kept 



90 



IF 




returning to the same conclusion. 

The only reason the girl would 
use tfiat Code Card as identity was 
that she had no identity of her own. 
She didn’t exist. Legally she was a 
nonentity. 

And Linton James thought he 
knew why. 

Substantial rewards existed for 
turning in a criminal and a 
nonentity had to — by definition — 
be a criminal. He folded the form 
and tucked it into his pocket. 

He would turn the girl in. 

He thought of her blue eyes, her 
unspoiled youthful air of innocence. 

Yes, he would turn her in. 

But first... 

AT THIS time of morning the 
bus service from the city to 
the outlaying districts was in- 
frequent and Mary Atkinson stood 
for some time at the bus stop, the 
dog and the two black boxes at her 
feet. From time to time people hur- 
rying along the pavement to their 
various duties about the city would 
step close to the boxes and the dog’s 
upper lip would curl back and he 
would move closer, crouching over 
the Friends. After a while a short 
queue had built up — a few people 
glanced curiously at the young girl 
standing at the stop, lost in thought, 
the dog and boxes at her feet. 

Mary was, in fact, trying hard 
not to cry and by this unusual exhi- 
bition of emotion draw attention to 
herself. She hardly dared to look at 
the boxes — she knew that if she 



allowed her attention to dwell on 
them the tears would fall. In her 
misery she failed to notice the 
figure of Linton James, clad in a 
shapeless raincoat, tag on to the 
end of the queue. 

At last the hoverbus pulled up 
with a whistle of expended air. She 
picked up one of the Friends — the 
dog took the other — and both 
climbed on board. Mary inserted 
her Code Card into the ticket 
mechanism. 

The bus at this time was practi- 
cally empty. She chose a seat in the 
rear, setting the boxes on the floor 
at her feet and calling the dog in 
close. He looked up at her from 
moist eyes, then settled under the 
seat. The bus started. 

A woman sat on the adjacent pair 
of seats, entrenched among 
packages, glanced at her, then 
leaned across. 

“Hello, there. Isn’t it Woman 
Mary Atkinson?” 

Mary looked up, startled. 
“Oh — Woman Biggs. Why, hello. 
Hello. You’re leaving town early 
this morning.” 

“I just had to pick up a few 
things.” She looked at the floor 
beside Mary. “Hi there, dog. 
What’s that you’ve got? Friends?” 
She regarded Mary curiously. 

“Yes.” 

“Oh.” the woman hesitated. 
“Who are they? Anyone I know?” 

Mary was silent. 

“Well — now let me see.” The 
woman stared at the boxes, her

expression intent and amused like 
one taking part in a guessing 
game. “Let me see. You’re from 
Branscombe. I don’t know many 
people that far out of town. You 
keep pretty much to yourselves. 
But — wait a minute — a month ago 
I saw you in Sidford with two 
people. They must have been in 
their late thirties — Why, you’re 
crying, Mary. What’s the matter?’’ 

Mary sniffed into her hand- 
kerchief. 

Woman Biggs stared at her with 
interest. “I haven’t seen anyone cry 
for years. It’s nice to know people 
have emotions left. I don’t think 
I’ve cried since I was eighty-nine 
mental — that was when Bob Se- 
combe got Total Death on a driving 
charge. Do you remember Bob Se- 
combe?” 

Mary shook her head dun^ly. 

“I thought everyone knew Bob 
Secombe. I hope I knew him better 
than most, though. Funny you 
never knew him.” 

Mary made a supreme effort. She 
didn’t want to talk about Bob Se- 
combe. She gave her cheeks a final 
mopping and indicated the boxes. 
“These people looked after me 
during my last childhood,” she said 
unsteadily. “They were very kind to 
me. One feels so helpless during 
childhood. It seemed the least I 
could do was to take them as 
Friends. The Waiting List for 
bodies is several years now. 
They — ” She nearly broke down 
again. “They went for physical 



euthanasia yesterday. I collected 
them this morning.” 

“Oh. Very public-spirited of you. 
I’m sure.” Woman Biggs regarded 
Mary with that special look of re- 
spectful dislike reserved for do- 
gooders. “I hope you realize what 
you’re taking on. Friends can be 
difficult — always complaining. I 
know.” Suddenly she chuckled, 
looking almost human. “I’ve been a 
bastard myself, during various 
Friendship periods. It’s the inac- 
tivity that gets you. Ah, well. I’m 
thirty-four physical. I’ve got a clean 
record, so it’s me for the box myself 
in six years’ time. Comes to all of 
us. Mustn’t grumble. May my next 
body be beautiful.” With this 
cascade of platitudes she relapsed 
into silence, pulled out a portovee 
and stared at it avidly. 

Relieved, Mary turned away and 
looked out through the window. 
The concrete suburbs had given 
way to more open, agricultural 
land — here and there huge ma- 
chinery stalked the fields like ste- 
gasauri. She spoke quietly to the 
Friends. “Are you both all right?” 

“Fine,” the answer came back. 
The dog started beneath her feet 
and whined softly. 

“Jason recognizes you,” she mur- 
mured. Somehow this seemed im- 
portant. 

She sat in silence then. The 
countryside gradually became more 
hilly, with occasional outcrops of 
trees on land too rough and stony 
for economical farming. Twenty

minutes later the hoverbus hissed to 
a halt at a small village, a huddle of 
domes and rectangles between steep 
hillsides. Mary disembarked. With 
Jason trotting behind she made her 
way across the small forecourt and 
climbed into her car, lifting the 
Friends carefully to the back seat. 
The dog jumped in beside her, the 
door closed and she moved off, 
turning south down the narrow lane 
signposted branscombe. 

Standing in the shadow of the 
bus, Linton James watched the re- 
ceding hovercar in some an- 
noyance. He hadn’t bargained for 
Mary’s having her own trans- 
portation. He had no alternative 
but to follow on foot. 

M ary drove slowly through 
Branscombe, a ghost village 
of ancient stone cottages, relics of 
the days before pollution had 
diminished the fishing and tourist 
industries. The village, once 
thriving, now had a population of 
some thirty dropouts from urban 
life who lived by marketing vege- 
tables and fruits unsuited for mass 
production on the huge state farms. 
Broken windows gaped at the 
hovercar as it climbed the steep hill 
to the clifftop. The rough road de- 
teriorated to a track. 

Five minutes later Mary pulled 
up outside a cottage some fifty 
yards from the edge of the cliff. She 
and Jason carried the Friends inside 
and placed them on the floor. She 
sat down with a sigh of relief. 



“We’re here,” she informed the 
boxes, rather shakily. 

“Fine,” one of the boxes said. 
“We’re very grateful to you, Mary. 
You were under no obligation to 
1)ring us here.” 

“What? After all you’ve done for 
me these past years? It was the least 
1 could do. I couldn’t leave you in 
that place.” 

The other box spoke, a woman’s 
voice. “But the risk you took, 
Mary. We didn’t want you to do 
that. You could have left us. I 
couldn’t believe it when the man 
said you’d come to fetch us — ” 

The male box said in a reproving 
tone, “It wasn’t what we had ar- 
ranged. You may have called at- 
tention to yourself. If I recall cor- 
rectly, my girl, the arrangement 
was that you would get into the 
Center and take the Code Card so 
that you could use it yourself until 
we came up for placing in bodies 
again. The authorities would think 
the card had gotten lost somewhere 
and would issue a duplicate. Then 
we would all have cards.” 

“That’s all right,” said Mary. “I 
can keep you here for as long as I 
like. When I take you back to the 
Transfer Center the same thing will 
apply. They’ll find they’re a card 
short and will issue another. I don’t 
see any problem.” 

“But the risk — ” murmured the 
female Friend helplessly. 

“Oh, be quiet. Mum,” said 
Mary. She got up and began to 
prepare herself some coffee while

the two Friends chattered to each 
other. 

E dgar greenwood and 

Mary Atkinson had sought 
refuge in iBranscombe from the 
concrete falsity of Axminster some 
sixteen years earlier. Both were 
then twenty-four physical years old 
and considered themselves in love, 
a pleasant fantasy in which most 
people indulged approximately 
once every physical lifetime. It did 
no harm — indeed it was of positive 
benefit, this periodic heightening of 
the emotions. It provided most 
people with something to look for- 
ward to during their late thirties. A 
new childhood, a new adolescence 
with the added benefit of ex- 
perience, a new love affair at the 
height of the new body’s powers. 
The prospect also made the waiting 
peric^ in the Friendship boxes 
more bearable. 

A mutual acquaintance had told 
them of Branscombe and the 
deserted cottages, and they arrived 
one autumn morning for a short 
honeymoon. At first they stayed in 
the village itself and got to know 
the few hard-working inhabitants. 
The day they were due to return to 
their jobs in the city they loaded the 
hovercar with their baggage and 
climbed in. Edgar had even pressed 
the starter when he turned for a last 
look at the sea. Mary had been 
looking in the same di- 
rection— now, suddenly, she turned 
to face him. Without a word both of 



them got out of the car, unloaded 
their baggage and, under the 
amused gaze of the villagers, 
marched back into the cottage. 

It seemed that there was no 
problem about their jobs — the local 
employment office took the view 
that it was their own business if 
they wanted to rough it in Brans- 
combe. This was a relief — some- 
how, due to the extreme regimenta- 
tion of labor in Axminster, they 
had gotten the idea that there was 
something illegal about dropping 
out in this manner — but apparently 
it was not so. There was unemploy- 
ment in the city — someone else 
would be glad to take their places. 
There was just one small snag: 
it was suspected, though never 
overtly stated, that preference on 
the Waiting List for bodies was 
given to Friends who had held 
regular jobs in their last physical 
lives. But Edger and Mary were 
twenty-four and Transfer was 
sixteen years away. 

Life was pleasant in Branscombe. 
The neighbors were helpful and 
Edgar soon established an adequate 
income from a smallholding on the 
hillside. The weeks went by and 
each day he and Mary discovered to 
their recurring delight that they 
were still in love. Soon Mary be- 
came pregnant. 

They moved out of the village to 
Cliff Cottage, a half-mile away, 
and in the following October Mary 
bore a daughter. She was a wonder- 
fully pretty baby, Edgar and Mary

thought. They had been living at 
Branscombe for a year by now and 
Axminster seemed far away — as 
did the laws of the land. 

For days they avoided the subject 
of the Transfer Center and their 
legal obligations concerning the 
baby. It seemed to them diaboli- 
cally wrong for this child to be 
taken to the Center — there to be 
implanted with someone else's 
adult mind. Unfortunately the law 
stated that it was a crime for them 
not to relinquish the baby. 

There was never a definite time 
when Edgar and Mary admitted to 
themselves that they intended to 
break the law. But the days went by 
and the baby grew and somehow 
they never got around to reporting 
the birth to the authorities. 
Eventually Edgar took the villagers 
into his confidence — there was no 
way this could be avoided — and, 
not entirely to this surprise, they 
were sympathetic. The matter was 
discussed at an informal meeting, 
out of which came a surprising sug- 
gestion. 

If the child became known as 
Mary Atkinson — if it took its 
mother’s name — there would be no 
reason why it shouldn’t move about 
freely, using the mother’s Code 
Card as a means of identification 
when required. The same card 
would serve for both people. 

So the child grew up as Mary 
Atkinson, looked after by Edgar 
Greenwood and Mary Atkinson 
Senior — and, indirectly, the village 



of Branscombe. Naturally, as the 
first real child many of the residents 
had seen for well over a century, she 
received the best of attention. 
Then — when she was fifteen years 
old — her parents became due for 
physical euthanasia. Their Code 
Cards had to be surrendered and 
Mary lost her identity again. It was 
likely that her parents would have 
to remain in Friendship Boxes for 
several years, during which period 
Mary might at any time be called 
upon to prove her identity. 

So the scheme of stealing back 
the Code Card was born. It would 
probably have worked, too, if Mary 
had not, out of sympathy to her 
parents, contracted to look after 
them for a while. 

ii "VT'OU’RE quite sure nobody 
X suspected anything, dear?” 
asked Friend Mary Atkinson 
Senior. 

“I’m sure they didn’t,” Mary re- 
plied. During the past hour she had* 
answered the same question at least 
six times. 

“What about that man I heard 
talking?” her father asked. “I 
didn’t like the sound of his voice. 
He was trying to — make out with 
you, you know.” Edgar Greenwood 
was concerned. In his present 
helpless state he doubted her ability 
to cope with the pack of lustful 
males his imagination saw sniffing 
around her. 

“I didn’t like him,” Mary 
reassured him. 



THE NEVER GIRL

Edgar was silent, torturing 
himself. Mary was growing up and 
he had not thought of this soon 
enough. He had brought a totally 
innocent child into a world of men, 
any one of whom had had at least 
one hundred and sixty years’ ex- 
perience. 

Mary poured herself a cup of cof- 
fee and sat down again, eyeing the 
Friends thoughtfully. The resilience 
of youth had abated her initial sor- 
row and now she must consider the 
implications of the present situa- 
tion. Money was fortunately no 
problem. The villagers had offered 
their assistance toward keeping the 
smallholding in shape for the next 
few years. In addition, her father 
had built up substantial savings. 

“What are you doing, dear?” 
asked her mother. 

“I’m drinking a cup of coffee.” 

“Oh? I hope you haven’t made it 
too strong, dear. Coffee’s not good 
for a girl of your age.” 

E )GAR greenwood broke 

in. “What I wouldn’t give for a 
scotch right now.” 

Mary Atkinson Senior made a 
sound very much like the clicking of 
a tongue. “Edgar! Not at this hour 
of the morning. Oh — ” She broke 
off as the needlessness of her 
remark struck her. “It always takes 
a day or two to get used to the 
Friendship box,” she said in a small 
voice. 

Mary, sipping her coffee and re- 



garding the two boxes on the floor, 
felt the sadness well up in her again. 
She put down her cup. “1 think I’d 
better get along to the smallholding 
and make sure things are all right,” 
she remarked. “Jason can stay here 
with you.” She stood up. 

Edgar said, “Make sure Jeffs 
knocking the bottom leaves off the 
sprouts. They grow firmer that 
way. And those leeks should need 
earthing up again.” 

Mary stepped out into the au- 
tumn sunshine, closing the door be- 
hind her. She stood for a moment 
on the rough track to the village, 
looking out to sea. The sky was 
cloudless and the sea’s ultramarine 
dashed with silver — a tanker crept 
along the horizon. She could hear 
the muted rumble of the waves at 
the cliff base and walked across the 
short springy grass, looked down at 
the rocks a hundred feet below. The 
water was deep there, the rocks jag- 
ged, and the waves lapped and slob- 
bered in and out of the clefts. Mary 
shuddered involuntarily and won- 
dered why the scene always sug- 
gested suicide to her. What was her 
fascination with the rocks washed 
by the sea far below? Why didn’t 
they caU to her mind fishing, 
bathing or climbing — or even 
murder? Why always, always sui- 
cide? 

Shivering the thought from her 
mind she turned and walked along 
the cliff path toward the village. 
After a while the ground began to 
fall away and the cottages were in

sight, gray and peaceful in the sun. 
She walked over to the 
smallholding, a series of neat rec- 
tangles of cultivation on the 
hillside. A slight Figure was there, 
bent double, weeding. 

“Hello, Jeff,” she called. 

J EFF WATERS looked up and, 
seeing Mary, grinned. He was 
eleven physical years old and, like 
everyone in the village, believed in 
working to the best of his capa- 
bilities regardless of his physical 
age. The community was too small 
for passengers and it was accepted 
that people going through a child- 
hood undertook light work. 

“Hello, Mary. Can I assume 
everything went all right? I saw the 
car go past a while back.” 

“Oh, yes. No difficulty. I even 
brought Mum and Dad back as 
Friends.” 

“You what?” Astonishment 
changed Jeffs grin. “Well, I’m 
damned. You’ve got a hell of a 
nerve, Mary. That’s the advantage 
of being truly young, I reckon. 
When you get to be my age and 
have had a few Transfers life seems 
more valuable with each body. You 
become so cautious that in the end 
it’s a wonder you ever do anything 
at all.” He sighed. “It must be 
great to be young.” 

“It’s not all good.” Mary smiled. 
“Every single person I meet is more 
experienced than I in every way. 
There was a man at the Transfer 
Center this morning who ~gave me 



the creeps in the weirdest way — and 
I couldn’t think why. It was some- 
thing to do with sex, I suppose.” 

Jeff regarded her, the intent adult 
appraisal incongruous on his 
childish face. She was flushed from 
her walk in the sun and the dress 
clung to her figure. He found 
himself wishing he were a few 
physical years older. “Oh, God,” he 
said quietly, as the implications of 
her innocence struck him again. 
She' was probably the only girl in 
the country who had never... “Be 
careful, Mary,” he said earnestly. 
“You’re growing up into a very 
pretty woman.” 

“I can take care of myself,” she 
assured him. She laughed at his 
expression. ‘^Mum and Dad have 
told me the facts of life.” 

“I dare say, but — Oh, well, I 
suppose it’s safe enough here in the 
village. There are a lot of queer 
characters in Axminster, though.” 

Mary found his concern amusing. 
“Don’t worry, Jeff. You all treat 
me as though I were a child. It does 
me good, though. I was feeling ter- 
rible a minute ago. It seemed 
everything was weighing me down, 
with Mum and Dad in boxes. Sud- 
denly I had responsibilities — I’ve 
got to look after the two people 
who had been looking after me all 
my life. I found myself wondering if 
I was up to it. But talking to you 
and hearing all this nonsense about 
the sex maniacs in Axminister 
again— why, it’s quite like old 
times. Can’t you villagers realize 



THE NEVER GIRL 



97 




that Axminster folk are just like 
yourselves?” 

“Maybe so, but we’ve known you 
since you were a baby, Mary. No- 
body in the village would lay a 
finger on you.” Jeff smiled. “Not 
that I don’t find you attractive, 
myself.” 

“Why, you dirty young man! 
Speaking of dirt, Dad asked me to 
remind you about earthing up the 
leeks.” 

“All done.” Jeff waved a hand at 
the neat ridges. 

Mary glanced at him suspi- 
ciously, bent down and brushed 
away soil. Tips of strong, grasslike 
leaves showed. “Oh, good. A bit 
deep, aren’t they? Will they come 
through again?” 

“Of coui;se,” he replied patiently. 
“I always reckoned Edgar didn’t 
put his leeks in deep enough.” 

“My Dad’s the best gardener in 
Branscombe — ” Mary broke off 
miserably at the thought of the im- 
mobile black box back at the cot- 
tage. 

“Never mind, honey. I’ve done 
the brussels sprouts as well. I ex- 
pect he asked about those.” 

“Thanks.” 

“And the potatoes — and every- 
thing else. You don’t have to worry 
about a thing. Just take it easy 
and look after your parents. 
Friends get frustrated and 
crotchety after a while. I tell you 
what. Bring them down to my place 
tonight. The conversation will do 
them good.” 



“I might do that. And thanks for 
your help, Jeff. I’d better get back. 
I’ll tell Dad everything’s in good 
hands.” 

“Fine.” 

Jeff watched her as she climbed 
back up the hillside. He sighed, 
feeling inexplicably sad. 



M ary herself was more 
cheerful as she took the road 
back to the cottage. With neighbors 
like Jeff Waters she would not need 
to worry. Apart from companion- 
ship, the needs of Friends were few. 
Also, she herself could move about 
with greater freedom now that she 
didn’t have to share a Code Card 
with her mother. This meant that 
she could, if she wanted, get a job in 
Axminster. She decided that she 
ought to discuss this with her 
parents. 

“Hello there! Wait a moment.” 
The shout came from behind her. 
She turned and saw a figure hur- 
rying up the slope from the village. 
She paused, expecting one of the 
neighbors. As the man drew closer, 
however, she became puzzled and 
turned away, quickening her pace. 
He was a stranger and strangers 
were suspect in these parts. All too 
frequently they proved to be state 
investigators poking about, trying 
to catch the community harboring 
some illegality. 

The man drew level and put a 
hand on her arm, restraining her. 
He smiled. “Hello, Mary. Don’t

you remember me? Linton James, 
from the Center.” 

She remembered him now. It was 
he all right, hot and flushed with 
haste. She fought down panic. 

“Of course I remember you,” she 
replied. “What are you doing here? 
Did I forget to sign the form?” A 
dread sat heavily in her 
stomach — she tried not to show it. 

“Oh, the form,” he said lightly. 
“Never mind that. No. It’s my day 
off — and seeing your address re- 
minded me I hadn’t been here for 
years. I thought I’d take the bus out 
and see what the old place looked 
like. I came here once — oh, three 
physical lives ago. A long time. 
How long have you lived here, 
Mary?” 

“All of this physical life.” 

“How are the Friends? Settling in 
all right?” 

“Fine.” She tried to move on, but 
his grip on her arm tightened. His 
smile had become fixed and intent 
as he regarded her. She looked 
toward the village desperately, but 
the houses were hidden by the crest. 

“Good,” he said. “It’s very kind 
of you to take two Friends like this. 
Helps us out a lot at the Center. I 
suppose you knew them in their 
previous life?” 

“They were two of the villagers. 
They looked after me during my 
last childhood.” 

“Not enough people think of 
being grateful. You’re a nice girl, 
Mary. I hope you don’t mind my 
calling you Mary — I feel as though 



1 know you quite well. Funny, how 
it sometimes happens like that. It 
was lucky for me I happened to be 
in the Center when you came in.” 

“I thought you said it was your 
day off.” 

“Well, you know how it is. I’ve 
got a pretty good position there. 
The boss — that’s Man Phillip 
Ewell — practically eats out of my 
hand. So I just said to him, Ewell, I 
said. I’m taking the day off. Enjoy 
yourself, Man James, he said. We 
have a good relationship, Ewell and 
I. He’s an android, but that doesn’t 
worry me. He’s only been in 
Axminster for a short while, so he 
has to depend on me a lot.” 

“I must be getting on. Nice 
meeting you again, Man James.” 
Mary tried to detach herself. She 
had a suspicion that James was 
slightly insane. 

“Don’t go. Not yet. Let’s sit 
down for a moment.” 

Mary found herself forced to the 
ground. James sat beside her, still 
gripping her arm, his feet dangling 
over the cliff edge. The waves below 
boomed dully. 

“I don’t often get the chance to 
talk to a nice girl like you,” he re- 
sumed. “Woman Adams, she’s the 
receptionist at the Center, she never 
speaks to me nicely. She thinks 
she’s better than me because she’s 
putting in for promotion to a 
Preferred Trade next year. She’s a 
bitch. She’s repulsive, physically, 
but she fancies her chances — ” 
Mary was terrified. The sea was a

long way below and her back was 
aching from holding herself bolt up- 
right, rigidly away from James who 
was now sliding his arm around her. 
Why didn't someone come? She 
didn’t know what to do. If she tried 
to get away from this madman he 
would push her over the edge, as 
like as not. 

“What’s more, I think there’s 
something going on between her 
and Ewell — that’s why she won’t 
have anything to do with me. She’s 
having an affair with that android. 
She thinks she’s too good for me.” 
James’ grip around Mary’s shoul- 
ders had relaxed and his expression 
was inward — he was reliving some 
past humiliation. “But why should 
I worry? I get plenty of girls. Funny 
thing — I’ve always been able to get 
on well with them. Girls seem to go 
for me. Do you find me attractive, 
Mary?” 

He twisted her around until his 
face was inches from hers and she 
could smell his acrid breath. She 
didn’t reply. She was trembling 
violently and a tear crept down her 
cheek. 

“Because I find you attractive, 
Mary. I find you very attractive. 
Don’t cry — it spoils your lovely 
face.” His gaze traveled down. 
“You’ve got nice legs. Did anyone 
ever tell you your legs are nice, 
Mary?” 



M ary flinched as his hand 
gripped her knee, squeezed. 



then slid upward. She pushed him 
away violently. 

“Leave me alone,” she protested. 
“Let me go!” 

His breath was coming fast — his 
face had a curiously sullen look. He 
pushed her down and lay half 
across her, talking fast. “Oh, come 
on, Mary, come on now, I love 
you — make love to me Mary. 
There’s nothing to be afraid of — ” 

He broke off suddenly as she 
slapped him across the face with 
her free hand. He gripped her wrist, 
winced as her knee drove into his 
stomach, pinned her to the ground 
while she twisted frantically. 

“Like that, is it?” His eyes stared 
into hers with an amalgam of hate 
and lust. “I thought so. You think 
you’re too good for me, like all the 
others. And that’s not all. You’ve 
never had it before, yoi^i little bitch. 
I know. I know that stunt you 
pulled with the card. You’re a 
nonentity. You’ve got no card of 
your own. I could turn you in.” His 
hand was fumbling under her skirt. 
“1 will turn you in, unless you lie 
still.” 

His other hand was cupped over 
her mouth. The terror in her eyes 
lent him confidence and strength. 
He felt supreme, all-powerful. 

Mary looked past his face at the 
blue sky. Little puffs of white cloud 
hovered above her and she could 
hear, beyond the fast urgent 
breathing, the dim roar of the sea at 
the cliff base. Was this happening 
to her — so near her own house and 



100

almost within view of the village? 
The coarse, short grass was^ rough 
against the backs of her legs. Her 
knees were forced apart and she 
tried to scream as the agony 
entered her, but something hot and 
stifling was covering her mouth. 



Ill 

AFTERWARD he dragged her to 
her feet. She stood unsteadily. 

“Now we go to your house,” he 
said stonily. Keeping hold of her 
arm, he began to propel her along 
the cliff path. “It’s along here, isn’t 
it? You’ve got a car there.” He felt 
dull and vindictive — the sight of the 
girl; bent and sniveling, irritated 
him. “For God’s sake, stop 
crying!” 

At the cottage he opened the door 
and pushed her inside. “Clean your- 
self up,” he commanded. “We’re 
taking a ride.” He glanced at the 
two black boxes. “Hello, Friends,” 
he said contemptuously. “I’ve just 
been enjoying your daughter’s com- 
pany. She is your daughter, right?” 
In the corner of the room the car- 
rier dog growled softly. “You don’t 
scare me, Fido. You’re programed 
to obey and never to attack. Sit, 
you stupid bastard.” The dog sat. 
James sniggered. 

“What — what did he do to you, 
Mary?” Edgar’s voice spoke. 

Mary ran into the bathroom. 

“She’s grown up all of a sudden,” 
James explained, cold amusement 



in his voice. “I did her a good turn, 
you might say. She’s had her ex- 
perience of adulthood just in time. 
Because she hasn’t got much more 
time, has she? She’s a nonentity. 
I’ve got proof. I’m going to take 
her to the Center now. Total Death. 
Still, she’s learned what life is all 
about.” 

“You swine.” The box spoke 
helplessly. “You lousy, rotten 
swine.” 

“Not very original,” commented 
James. He walked over to the box 
and kicked it heavily. “You’d bet- 
ter watch your language. Friend. 
Come to terms with yourself. You 
realize that concealing a birth is 
punishable by Total Death? You’re 
already in the box. There’ll be a 
trial, of course, but the evidence is 
all against you. Which means that 
you’ll never have a body again. 
After they find you guilty they’ll 
just wipe you out. Obliterate you. 
And your wife — I suppose that’s 
what you call her. Both of you. 
Oh, boy.” He chuckled insanely, 
feeling quite exalted. He, Linton 
James, was totally in command of 
the situation. 

“How old are you, exactly?” 
asked Edgar. 

“What’s it to you?” queried 
James suspiciously. 

“I just wondered. I wondered 
what sort of lousy series of lives 
could bring a man to your situation. 
I’d guess you were one of the last 
children and in all your lives others 
have been superior to you. I ought 



THE NEVER GIRL 



101 




to feel sorry for you, I suppose.” 
“Thanks a lot. Very kind of you. 
I’m sure. And hasn’t your wife got 
anything to say? Is the other Mary 
Atkinson struck dumb? How about 
a bit of motherly sympathy for poor 
downtrodden Man Linton James?” 
The other box spoke at last. 
“There’s nothing I can say.” Mary 
Atkinson Senior sounded infinitely 
weary. “Except — why? What have 
you got against us all?” 

“Nothing personal. It’s just a 
question of cash. I get prize money 
for this.” 

“We’ve got money.” 

“Thanks, no. I also get the 
chance of being promoted to a 
Preferred Trade. You know what 
that means? No Friendship period 
for me. Immediate Transfer to 
another body at age forty. That’s 
worth more cash than you’ve got.” 
He walked to the bathroom and 
jerked open the door. “Hey, Go- 
diva,” he said, grinning. “Get some 
clothes on. We’re going. Your folks 
have just failed to buy me off.” 
Eventually Mary emerged in a 
clean dress. Ignoring James, she 
addressed the boxes. “Bye, Mum,” 
she said quietly, “Bye, Dad. 
I’m — I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. I 
should never have tried to get you 
out of the Center.” 

“You can cut out the tender fare- 
wells,” James said. He addressed 
the boxes. “We’ll be coming back. 
You constitute evidence, right 
where you are in your own house. I 
want the police to see you here.” 



He laughed, seized Mary by the 
arm and took her to the car. 

AN PHILLIP EWELL 
looked up as they entered. 
“Yes, James?” He regarded Mary 
with surprise. 

Linton James smirked. “One 
nonentity,” he said, pushing Mary 
forward. “Together with evidence.” 
He reached into his pocket. “One 
Friendship contract incorrectly 
filled out, one Code Card fraudu- 
lently being used by said 
nonentity.” 

“Oh?” Ewell took the proffered 
items, glancing at James with some 
distaste. “Why didn’t you go to the 
police?” 

“Thought I’d see you first, you 
being in charge of the Center, 
There’s more evidence at Brans- 
combe. Two Friends — with carrier 
dog us^d in said fraud.” 

“For God’s sake, stop talking 
like a policeman, James. Let’s get 
this straight. Tell me the story in 
sensible language. What’s it all 
about?” 

Somewhat abashed, James ex- 
plained, describing the visit of 
Mary to contract for the Friends. 
He laid emphasis on her 
nervousness. He related his dis- 
covery of the duplication of names 
and of the missing card in the 
Habitation Room. The chase to 
Branscombe. The confrontation 
with the parents. The confession. 

“Mary Atkinson,” Ewell read the 
name thoughtfully. 




102 



IF 




“So we’ve got one card 
representing both this girl here and 
a Friend at present in a cottage at 
Branscombe, both of whom have 
"committed criminal acts punishable 
by. Total Death,” explained James 
unctuously. “To say nothing of 
another Friend at Branscombe who 
is guilty of concealing a birth. Here 
is his card from the Habitation 
Room.” 

“Yes, yes,” said Ewell im- 
patiently. He looked at Mary. The 
whole affair disgusted him — he 
wished James had gone to the 
police in the first place. He, Ewell, 
was a surgeon, not a tribunal. The 
girl looked scared stiff, which 
wasn’t surprising. He felt sorry for 
her — after all, it wasn’t her fault 
that her birth had been concealed. 
Still, his duty in the matter was 
clear. “Do you agree with what 
Man James has said. Woman 
Atkinson?” 

Mary nodded dumbly. 

“Oh.” He tapped his fingers 
thoughtfully on the desk. James 
was right, of course. You could tell 
at a glance that this girl was im- 
mature. She reminded him of a 
daughter he once had. 

Phillip Ewell was an android and 
therefore in unusual ways 
privileged, not by law, but by cir- 
cumstances. The birthrate had 
fallen, as had been expected, 
following the enactment of the 
Transfer laws. Android births, 
however, had in recent years risen, 
with the result that many android 



children were allowed to progress 
to adulthood in the family at- 
mosphere of their parents’ homes. 
Other humans generally opted for 
Friendship rather than accept 
Transfer to an android body. 

Phillip Ewell had once watched 
with undying delight his daughter’s 
progress from childhood to 
womanhood and had thanked God 
that he was an android. The child’s 
mother, a human woman named 
Alice Lander, with whom he had 
had an affair many years ago, had 
been a Placement Officer and had 
placed the tiny child in a creche for 
future use as a host body, though 
she had not been legally obliged to 
give up the child, technically an 
android. A woman in her position, 
she had told him, could hardly 
bring up a half-breed child. He had 
traced the infant, taken it home 
and, with the assistance of a female 
companion, brought it up. 

Thus he was able to rationalize 
his sympathy as he looked at Mary. 
So it was tough on the kid and she 
reminded him of his daughter. But 
Mary was a human, a nonentity, 
and her parents were criminals. He 
had no alternative. He stood, 
picking up the evidence. Thumbing 
the button on his visiphone, he 
spoke briefly to police head- 
quarters, requesting their 'Jjresence 
at Branscombe. 

“We’ll take your car, if we may,” 
he said to Mary. 

She nodded and muttered some- 
thing. 



THE NEVER GIRL

“What’s that, child? Speak up.” 
Mary looked straight at 
him — there was decision in her blue 
eyes. “This man — ” she indicated 
James — “raped me. I — I wouldn’t 
say anything now, but — my parents 
know. 1 couldn’t stand going dM 
through it again — with them there. 
But they’ll tell you — if you don’t be- 
lieve me. He bragged about it to 
them.” 

Ewell sat down abruptly, staring 
at James. 

“Is she telling the truth?” 

James shuffled his feet, then 
regarded Ewell defiantly. “She’s 
telling the truth,” he said. “Okay, I 
raped her. She led me on, though. 1 
was following her to find out where 
she lived and she said hello 
and — made me want her. You 
know how they do.” He winked 
knowingly. “Anyway, I don’t see 
that it matters. She’s a nonentity. 
You can’t commit a crime against a 
nonentity. If she preferred a charge, 
it wouldn’t even reach the courts.” 
Ewell looked at him for a long 
time. At last he said quietly, 
“James, you are a lucky, dirty little 
bastard.” 

“There’s no cause to go speaking 
to me like that, Man Ewell!” 
“There’s every cause — and you 
know it. I know why you involved 
me in this thing instead of going 
straight to the police. It wasn’t only 
because you' wanted me as a 
witness. It was because you wanted 
my recommendation when ^ou ap- 
ply to be^pgraded as Preferred. 

104 



You thought the police might take 
all the credit. You wanted to be 
sure I understood how clever you’d 
been in making your miserable lit- 
tle arrest. Right? Well,- I under- 
stand. And I tell you this: as long as 
I’m the surgeon in charge of 
Axminster Transfer Center you’ll 
get no recommendation from me. 
This whole thing stinks. My job is 
performing Transfer operations, 
not running around the country 
after so-called criminals.” He 
looked at Mary helplessly. “I’m 
afraid there’s nothing much I can 
do for you, my dear. The law is 
clear enough.” 

“But I want you as a witness, 
Man Ewell,” insisted James stub- 
bornly. 

“Right. Let’s get over to Brans- 
combe, then. And I want you tcT 
understand, James — 1 have not the 
slightest sympathy with your ac- 
tions. I’ll witness because the law 
compels me to, as senior of the 
Center. But I won’t say one word 
that might cause your prize money 
to be increased.” 

Somewhat shaken, James 
stepped aside as Ewell politely took 
Mary’s arm and conducted her 
from the room. 

P fHILLIP EWELL was es- 
sentially kind-hearted. He fre- 
quently came across instances of 
hardship where he felt the law 
might resonably be relaxed. The 
case of Mary Atkinson was one 
such. Through no fault of her own 

IF 




the girl could not be allowed to 
exist. 

The parents were a different 
proposition, he felt. They had com- 
mitted their crime fifteen years ago 
for purely selfish reasons and 
without thought of the problems it 
would present their daughter as she 
grew older. At best she could have 
looked forward to a perilous life in 
hiding, knowing that detection 
would mean Total Death for her 
,mother as well as herself. He had 
very little sympathy for the 
parents — if they had simply wanted 
her to survive they could have tried 
placing her with androids. He had 
heard of instances. 

“What are your parents like, 
Mary?” he asked curiously as the 
hovercar sped out of the city, 
Linton James at the wheel. 

She had been sitting hunched in a 
corner, gazing dully through the 
window. She brightened at his 
question. “They’re nice,” she said. 
“They both worked very hard, like 
all the dropouts at Branscombe, but 
they still had plenty of time for me 
and for enjoying themselves. These 
last few years I’ve been helping 
them on the smallholding. They’ve 
been wonderful to me all my life. 
Still, i suppose all real parents are 
like that — were like that, I mean.” 

“You don’t think — ” He hesi- 
tated, not wishing to upset her, but 
wanting nevertheless to know. The 
psychology of concealed births 
interested him. “You don’t think 
that perhaps they were a little bit 



selfish, bringing you up the way 
they did? I mean, they must have 
known you’d be found out in the 
end — and they as well.” 

“And we’d all get Total Death?” 
She looked at him candidly — he 
was amazed at her composure. 
“That’s the luck of the game. They 
went into it with their eyes open. 
They wanted a child of their own 
and they had one. As for me, what 
difference does it make? If they had 
reported me in the proper manner 
I’d have been taken from them as a 
baby. At six months my head would 
have been opened and someone 
else’s grown-up brain would have 
been put in there.” She made a 
face. “I’d never have known what 
it’s like to be me, would I?” 

She took his hand and stared into 
his eyes. “What does it feel like, 
Man Phillip Ewell, to be walking 
about in someone else’s body? 
You’re a Transfer Surgeon. I’ll bet 
you’ve done so many operations 
you never even think of it any more. 
Tell me this. Have you ever won- 
dered what the child — the one 
who’s body you’re wearing — would 
have grown up like?” 

Ewell jerked his hand away as a 
thrill of pure horror ran down his 
spine. 

In front, James twisted around, 
the car on automatic. “She’s dan- 
gerous, Man Ewell. She’s up to all 
the tricks like the rest of the 
dropouts. They’ve got no respect 
for the law, so they try to put their 
own twisted reason in its place. Do

you know, recently a lot of them 
have been opting for Total Death 
when the time of their Transfer 
comes around? That’s probably 
why her parents weren’t too wor- 
ried about breaking the law. They 
have no thought for humanity as a 
whole and the drain on total brain- 
power people like them cause when 
they opt to die.” 

Ewell recovered — he wasn’t 

going to let James get away with 
that. “I’m afraid I believe in the 
right of any individual to die if he 
wants to,” he said firmly. “If you 
want to get along with me you’d 
better believe the same. There must 
be some freedom, for God’s sake.” 
“Thank you, Man Ewell,” said 
Mary. 

S OME time later they drew up 
outside the cottage. Ewell 
climbed from the car reluctantly — 
he had no stomach for the painful 
interview to follow. At least, he 
thought, the police hadn’t yet 
arrived. James led the way and he 
followed, holding Mary’s arm 
lightly, half-hoping she would make 
a run for it. The area was remote 
and she had friends around. 

After the early afternoon sunlight 
the interior of the cottage was dark. 
Ewell blinked, saw a table and a 
few chairs, sat Mary down and 
turned to James. 

He sighed. “Let’s get on with it. 
The police will be here in a minute. 
I’ll just hear the confessions and 
then go, if you don’t mind. You can 



deal with all the formalities.” 
James was staring into the corner 
of the room. There was a moment’s 
silence. 

“Well?” 

James whispered, “Something’s 
gone wrong. Oh, Christ — ” 

“What the hell’s the matter with 
you?” 

James swung round. “There’s 
only one box there, Man Ewell. 
There’s only one box. I left two of 
them. Her parents. I swear both her 
parents were here when I left.” He 
was almost crying, 

“Pull yourself together. Here, let 
me have a look.” Ewell walked 
about the room, peering under the 
table, the chairs. There was no sign 
of the other Friend. 

Linton James turned on Mary. 
“Where’s it gone, you little bas- 
tard? What sort of trick have you 
pulled?” 

Mary was silent. There was a 
quiet dread in her eyes. 

James seized the remaining box 
and put it on the table. “Where’s 
the other one?” he shouted. “What 
have you done with your — ” Who 
the hell are you anyway?” He bent 
forward, peering at the number. 

“I’m Edgar Greenwood,” stated 
the box quietly. 

“Where’s your damned wife?” 
“She’s not here.” the box 
sounded infinitely sad. 

“1 can see that!” shouted James, 
pounding the Friend with his fist. 
“Where’s she gone?” 

“Gone? Let’^ just say that she’s 



106 



IF 




exercised one of the few right 
remaining to her.” 

Mary was crying softly. From a 
distance came the faint wail of the 
police siren. 

“What the hell are you trying to 
say?” James was beside himself. He 
yelled into the Friend’s micro- 
phone. “Are you telling me she’s 
killed herself? Because I won’t take 
that. She couldn’t have moved. Oh, 
my God. The dog. Where is he?” 

Ewell walked to the door and 
looked into the sunshine. He 
thought for a moment, his features 
grave. The police siren was 
nearer — he could see a dark spot 
moving rapidly along the cliff path. 
He turned and entered the cottage, 
placing an arm around Mary, who 
was sobbing uncontrollably. 

“Oh, James,” he said. 

Linton James looked at him, his 
eyes wild. “What?” 

“You’re all overwrought.” Ewell 
handed him a cigarette, took one 
himself, struck a match. 

James puffed away gratefully, 
“Thanks. I’m sorry, Man Ewell. I 
got carried away, what with those 
crooks cheating me out of a third of 
my prize money — What are you 
doing?” 

The match still flared in Ewell’s 
fingers. He touched it to the edge of 
a piece of paper and watched with 
interest as it curled and blackened 
and flames crept around the edge. 

“A dramatic moment, James,” 
he murmured. 

For an instant James stared un- 



comprehending. Then he sprang 
forward with a yell. Ewell thrust 
him away roughly. He stumbled, 
fell to his knees and watched help- 
lessly as the flame consumed the 
last comer of the paper. Ewell 
ground the ashes under his foot. 

“You’ve burned the form she 
filled in before,” whispered James. 
“You’ve destroyed the evidence. 
What the hell are you playing at?” 
Ewell reached in his pocket and 
took out a Code Card. He handed it 
to Mary. “Here you are, my dear. 
You now have an identity.” 

He turned back to James, who 
had climbed to his feet and was 
watching Ewell wide-eyed. “You 
see, James, sometimes things can 
work themselves out without, shall 
we say, bureaucratic intervention. 
We "have one girl and we have one 
Friend. We have one Code Card 
here and one Code Card in the 
Transfer Center. It seems there was 
once an irregular document, but 
this has ceased to exist, so why

worry? All is technically in order.” 

James was silent, white-faced. 

“Oh, except for one matter,” 
Ewell went on. “Linton James, 1 
regret I must have you charged with 
the rape of Woman Mary 
Atkinson. If found guilty you will 
of course receive a sentence of not 
less than eight years and also be 
statutorily ineligible for future 
Transfers. I believe I can hear a 
police car.” 

Linton James stared at him, 
mumbled something unintelligible 
and ran from the room. They heard 
the back door slam. The police car 
wailed to a halt outside. 

Ewell touched Mary on the 
shoulder. “I’ll be back in a 
minute,” he said gently. He closed 
the door behind him. Outside, the 
police were emerging from their ve- 
hicle. 

“Our man got away,” Ewell in- 
formed them. “He just left through 
the back door. Rape case. He’s a 
vindictive little bastard — he told me 
all sorts of yarns. You shouldn’t 
have much trouble picking him 
up.” 

“Oh.” The inspector looked sur- 
prised. “Seeing it was you called us, 
Man Ewell, I thought it would be 
some Transfer case. You certainly 
get yourselves involved in some odd 
crimes, you Transfer people. 
What’s the man’s name?” 

“Linton James. A colleague of 
mine, unfortunately.” 

“So that’s how you come into it. 
Where’s the girl?” 



“Inside the house. She’s a bit 
upset right now, but she’ll be all 
right. I’ll bring her to see you when 
she’s feeling better.” 

“Fine.” The inspector murmured 
into his throatmike, then addressed 
Ewell again. “I’m getting his name 
put on the indicator boards, just in 
case he gives us the slip for an hour 
or two. Someone will spot him.” 
He paused, looking toward the sea. 
“Nice place this. Bit remote, 
though.” He climbed back into the 
hovercar. “You’ll appear as a 
witness if necessary, Man Ewell?” 

“Of course.” 

The hovercar glided across the 
short grass and turned inland. 
Ewell watched it go, then walked to 
the cliffs edge where the carrier 
dog sat, gazing at the rocks below, 
whining softly. 

“You poor bastard,” murmured 
Ewell. He remembered dogs as they 
used to be, before the abolition of 
pets on the grounds of economy. 
The dog regarded him, thumped its 
tail on the short grass, then looked 
down again at the rocks and the sea 
a hundred feet below. “Trained to 
obey, regardless. Well, you did the 
right thing this time, old boy. Even 
if it hurt. You know, I misjudged 
your mistress? I thought she was a 
selfish woman, bringing up a kid in 
this world. I was wrong. Come on, 
boy! Let’s go and see how Mary 
is.” 

Together the android and the car- 
rier dog walked back to the cottage.

THE 

WIZARD 

OF 

ANHARITTE 

COLIN KAPP 




109 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



Civil unrest threatens Anharitte city 
on the planet Roget, just beginning the 
leap from feudalism into space-age 
technology. A giant Freetrade 
spaceport links Anharitte to an inter- 
planetary mercantile system centered 
on Earth under the Freetrade Council. 
Council director MAG NO VESTE- 
VAAL arrives on Roget to investigate, 
is briefed by Freetrade agent TITO 
REN. Cause of the unrest is 
enlightened treatment of slaves by the 
wealthy IMAIZ, also known as DION- 
DAIZAN, Lord of Magda, credited by 
natives as having magic powers. 

TITO suspects the IMAIZ is a Ter- 
ran-educated technological wizard and 
illegally a lord of Roget. He seems to 
be planning an end to feudalism, 
threatening Freetrade-fostered status 
quo. To check, VESTEVAAL con- 
fronts ZINDER-DION-DAIZANs 
lovely, highly educated showpiece 
slave. ZINDER easily bests VESTE- 
VAAL in the meeting. He then autho- 
rizes REN to discredit, perhaps even 
kUlDION-DAIZAN. 

REN enlists the services of a 
powerful native secret Society of The 
Pointed Tails, under leadership of 
CATUUL GRAS. REN immediately 
discovers his warehouse has been 
arsonized under auspices that suggest 
science and technology hitherto un- 
known on Roget. CATUUL GRAS 
retaliates by bribing a prefecture 
registry clerk to destroy the record of 
DION's legal ownership of ZINDER. 
The crooked clerk is instantly and mys- 
teriously killed. No evidence links 
DIQNDAIZAN to either arsdn or 



murder — he must, however, return 
ZINDER to auction. At the auction 
VESTEVAAL, according to plan, sets 
out to raise DION*s bid for her to a 
point where the lord of Magda would 
be broken financially. Instead, DION 
lets VESTEVAAL buy her for the as- 
tronomical sum of **200 million million 
Solar dollars.** Chagrined, VESTE- 
VAAL signs the document attesting to 
his ownership of ZINDER — but as 
soon as he and she have left the room 
the document spontanously combusts. 

ZINDER goes back on the block and 
is auctioned to DION for a nominal 
sum — against no opposition. 

IX 

I N THE laboratory aboard the 
battle cruiser at the spaceport 
Dr. Alek Hardun had been forming 
his own impressions of the Imaiz. 

“I’m afraid,” he said to Ren, 
“we’re up against a pretty for- 
midable technician.” 

“You have some answers, Alek?” 
“Some. But they reveal a class of 
technology 1 had not expected to 
find on a backward world like 
this.” 

Ren sat atop one of the labora- 
tory stools. “Don’t worry about the 
location. I’m already quite con- 
vinced that the Imaiz is Terran and 
is capable of anything including 
outmanipulating Magno Vestevaal 
himself. The incident with Zinder 
could have been funny if it hadn’t 
been so expensive.” 



no 




Hardun’s eyes twinkled momen- 
tarily. “I gather it was rather a 
warm evening,” he said. “But all 
things taken together. I’m not sur- 
prised. The way the register clerk 
died was no less clever.” 

“Have you found how it was 
done?” 

“Yes. We did a post-mortem ex- 
amination, but nearly missed the 
point. We were looking for a pro- 
jectile of some sort in the esoph- 
agus. Of course we didn’t find 
one — rather, we did find it but 
failed to recognize it for what it 
was.” 

“Spare me the riddles,” said Ren. 
“I’ve been up half the night helping 
the director to drown his sorrows.” 

“The answer, my dear Tito, was 
blood.” 

“I don’t see—” 

“Neither did we — at first. But 
trying to explore all possible 
avenues we ran some blood 
analyses to see if anything unusual 
showed up. Something did. We 
found two distinct blood groups^. 
One was the blood group of the 
clerk. The second was undoubtedly 
human blood but of a completely 
different group. Working on the 
second type of blood alone, we were 
able to determine that it had been 
carefully processed and then frozen. 

“The rest is conjecture, but it’s a 
reasonable supposition that what 
killed the clerk was a shaft of 



frozen blood projected by some 
l\igh velocity instrument at a fairly 
short range. Such a projectile in the 
throat would, of course, pass al- 
most unnoticed amid the blood 
and fragmentation caused by its im- 
pact and very shortly it would melt 
in the warm blood of its victim. A 
rather neat, self-obscuring murder^ 
weapon, I think.” 

Ren nodded thoughtfully. “And 
not one likely to be detectable by Di 
Irons and his primitive police 
methods. What sort of weapon 
could have been used to throw a 
shaft of frozen blood with the 
necessary velocity?” 

Alek Hardun pursed his lips. 
“That’s difficult to say. At first we 
thought in terms of an air rifle, but 
your fellow, Catuul Gras, was 
positive that he and his friends 
heard no sound at all. I think now 
that some form of crossbow is more 
likely. A good one can give you ve- 
locity and accuracy not much infe- 
rior to a rifle’s. The only special re- 
quirement is that the bolt must be 
maintained in a frozen condition 
until immediately before firing. 
This presupposes somebody with a 
Dewar flask and some experience in 
producing and handling materials 
at low temperatures. It all ties in 
neatly with your liquid-oxygen fire 
at the warehouse. I would not have 
believed it if I hadn’t seen the evi- 
dence — but there must be a 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE

competent cryogenics man at work 
in Magda.” 

“I can’t imagine our being able to 
use your evidence to convince Di 
Irons,” said Ren. “His world is 
bounded by the four ele- 
ments — earth, air, fire and water. I 
don’t think the distinction between 
cryogenics and necromancy is suffi- 
ciently obvious to make him move 
against Dion-daizan. Especially 
when Dion can set a sheet of paper 
afire at thirty paces without even 
moving.” 

“But he didn’t,” said Hardun. 
“The director set that afire 
himself.” 

“Explain it to me.” 

“It’s another example of the tech- 
nology I hadn’t expected to find. 
We’ve been working on the frag- 
ments of the page you gave us— and 
it isn’t paper at all. Somebody had 
inserted a special page in that book. 
Certainly the sheet was a fibrous 
cellulose material, but it had been 
impregnated with some strong 
oxidizing compound. Frankly, it 
would have crumbled to dust in a 
few weeks anyway, assuming that 
nobody had even touched it. But it 
was the ink in the director’s pen 
that touched off the fast reaction.” 
“But all the others wrote on it 
without effect,” objected Ren, 
“True. But on Roget all the 
available inks are water- 
based — and I’d be willing to bet the 



others all used an old-fashioned 
wet-dip nib pen.” 

Ren thought back carefully. “I 
think you’re right.” 

“Well, the effect of a water-based 
ink on the sheet is negligible. It 
redistributes the oxidant, but 
doesn’t react with it. But the di- 
rector predictably signed with his 
own pen — and that contained a 
modern outworld organic-based 
ink. The organics were rapidly 
oxidized and produced almost 
spontaneous combustion. The local 
heat thus liberated was sufficient to 
touch the rest of the page off in a 
self-destructive mode. That bond 
entry was definitely designed to 
have no future.” 

Ren smiled ruefully. “I suppose 
you could say we’ve only ourselves 
to blame. We did the same thing to 
Dion-daizan — but with only a 
fraction of the subtlety. The devil 
alone knows how much support 
he’s gained from the incident. I’d 
guess all Anharitte is laughing at us 
this morning.” 

“I think,” said Hardun, “you’re 
taking completely the wrong ap- 
proach. You’re making a game of 
this instead of trying for a fast, de- 
cisive strike. I know it’s your war, 
but the problem of Imaiz is also 
within my competence. I’d tackle 
the whole affair quite differently.” 

“This morning I could use a few 
ideas. I don’t promise to agree, but 



112 



IF 




I’d like to hear your version of how 
it should be done.” 

“Not how it should be done,” 
said Hardun. “How it must be 
done. I was thinking more on the 
lines of dusting the Castle Magda 
with carcinogens — or the careful 
application of * nerve gas. Perhaps 
even the introduction of an ergot 
derivative into their drinking 
water—” 

C ASTLE DI GUAARD was 
a daunting prospect. Con- 
structed originally as the first 
defense fortress overlooking the 
broad Aprillo river, it had seen 
much service against the Tyrene 
pirates who ventured to pass under 
its cannon to reach the internal wa- 
terways leading to the soft un- 
derflesh of the city and the 
provinces beyond. The pirates were 
gone now — their impetus having 
retreated into the more profitable 
enterprises of respectable trading 
houses — but the guns and the grim, 
crenelated battlements of Castle Di 
Guaard remained unchanged as 
though caught in some eddy of time 
itself. 

Matching its image as a fortress 
was the preparedness of the soldiery 
contained within its gray stone con- 
fines. Indeed, a full lookout and 
guard were maintained on all walls 
as though in anticipation of an im- 
minent attack. As Ren was admit- 



ted by Sonel Taw, the castellan — or 
governor — of the castle, he was im- 
mediately conscious of being in an 
armed citadel and, more 
surprisingly, one in which the men 
at arms not only carried primed 
muskets, but seemed fully prepared 
to use them on the slightest 
provocation. 

The unchanged character of Di 
Guaard also extended to the slaves, 
who in the main were ragged, 
wretched and nervously watchful, 
as though their lives depended on 
the speed with which they 
responded to a call for ‘ service. 
Many of them bore the scars of bar- 
barous punishments — all wore the 
hangdog expression of whipped 
curs, which turned Ren’s stomach 
slightly. Nowhere else in Anharitte 
had he seen slaves reduced to this 
condition. Remembering the proud 
strengths of Zinder, he experienced 
a slight twinge of conscience that 
his mission to Di Guaard was to 
gain support for the destruction of 
the enlightened House of Magda. 

Castle Di Guaard was built on 
the principle of a bailey within a 
bailey, the outer containing slave 
quarters, stores and work yards, the 
inner housing the soldiery. Both 
were surrounded by the great walls 
whose machicolated parapets and 
mural flanking towers were 
designed to resist attack from any 
point of (he compass. There was no

moat, the castle being on two sides 
met by the sheer drop of the cliffs 
overhanging the Aprillo delta. The 
two great gates inland were amply 
overseen by formidable gatehouses, 
each with outworks in the form of 
separate barbican towers. 

Ren followed the castellan 
without comment — and the latter 
seemed disinclined to enter con- 
versation. At one corner of the in- 
ner bailey stood the mighty round- 
tower of the great keep — the home 
of Delph Di Guaard himself — and 
it was here that Ren was led. The 
tower’s broad, flat roof was said to 
be the highest point in all the 
provinces and formed an excellent 
platform for observation and for 
the light chain-throwing cannon of 
which Di Guaard seemed inor- 
dinately fond. The whole at- 
mosphere was one of preparation 
for a battle or a siege. Ren could 
not help thinking that if the Imaiz* 
influence should ever bring to pass 
a revolution Castle Di Guaard 
would probably be the last place to 
fall to the insurgents. 

T IHAT Di Guaard was mad was 
no news to Ren, but having 
come from more civilized worlds he 
had forgotten that, without psy- 
chiatry and the overriding authority 
of the state, madness has no checks. 
Even more appalling was the 
realization that the gross madman 



whose chambers Ren now entered 
was undisputed lord of his own 
castle and held life or death control 
over a considerable number of sol- 
diers and slaves. Even Sonel Taw, 
the castellan, went patently in fear 
of his terrifying master and excused 
himself rapidly at the chamber 
door. 

As he crossed the floor alone Ren 
felt the full impact of the man. 
Delph Di Guaard was leaning over 
a huge table, his back to the door. 
His vast bulk suggested super- 
human strength and even from the 
rear Ren could sense the aura of 
power of the man’s tyrannic per- 
sonality. He found himself almost 
afraid of the moment when the 
creature would turn and face him. 

“Well?” Di Guaard’s voice made 
the chamber reverberate. “What 
news do you bring of the Tyrene?” 

“No news of the Tyrene, my 
Lord. I come about other matters.” 
Ren controlled his voice with a con- 
fident, faultless presence. His 
verbal bouts with Magno Vestevaal 
had been excellent training for this 
occasion. 

“Other matters?” Di Guaard 
shouted. “In time of war?” He 
swung about and Ren looked un- 
flinchingly into the staring, ac- 
cusing eyes of the mad lord. The 
fellow’s visage writhed constantly 
with the underplay of some shaded 
thoughts in which anger and 



114 



IF 




comprehension chased each other 
continuously through the flesh. 
“Ah, an outworlder. That would 
explain your naivete. You must be 
Agent Ren. My castellan mumbled 
something about your coming. Well 
you’ve come to the right man. Have 
the Tyrene sacked your warehouse, 
slaughtered your servants or raped 
your daughters?” His^ mouth al- 
most drooled at the vision. 

“None of those,” said Ren. “My 
news is more serious. It concerns 
the very existence of Anharitte 
itself.” 

Di Guaard hit the table a heavy 
blow with his hand. “I knew it! 1 
told that fool Di Irons that one day 
the pirates would attack in force. 
You see here — ” His thick fingers 
jabbed pointlessly at a torn chart on 
the table. “That’s the reason why so 
many of their ships have congre- 
gated to the north. We have con- 
stant sightings of a hundred, two 
hundred ships — they say an ar- 
mada. And I, Di Guaard, am the 
only one in the three hills who keeps 
his defenses ready. The rest of them 
think me mad, but now it’s I who 
am proven sane. Don’t you agree 
that unpreparedness in time of war 
is mad?” 

“Of course,” said Ren, de- 
termined to remain undaunted. 
“But the danger 1 speak of comes 
from within Anharitte, not from the 
sea.” 



Di Guaard’s scowl changed to an 
expression of intense consternation. 
“You me^ the Tyrene came over- 
land across TEmpte?” He 
consulted his charts again and then 
threw them furiously back on the 
table. He rounded on Ren in a 
frightening blaze of anger. 

“Liar! What mischief are you 
selling, merchant? Dion-daizan 
keeps close watch on the inland 
waters. If any Tyrene were coming 
that way he’d have been sure to let 
me know.” 

“Listen to me.” Ren let his voice 
grow loud for the first time. “While 
you watch for the Tyrene an even 
greater threat is growing right be- 
neath your feet. Dion-daizan is edu- 
cating slaves.. If enough become 
educated there will be a revolution 
that will ruin us all more surely 
than any pirate raid.” 

“Really?” Di Guaard’s face lit up 
with the malicious interest of a wolf 
about to tear apart a particularly 
succulent lamb. “And what makes 
an outworld merchant’s lackey 
presume to tell the lords of An- 
haritte what they should or should 
not do with their slaves? Dion’s 
more capable than most at con- 
trolling an uprising among his 
bondslaves. Dion’s more than ca- 
pable of controlling anything.” As 
he said this last phrase, Di 
Guaard’s voice fell to an unex- 
pected wistfulness, as if even he ac- 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



115 




knowledged the power of the Imaiz, 

“I didn’t say he wasn’t,” said 
Ren, suddenly forced on to the de- 
fensive. “My point was that his ac- 
tivities are likely to cause an 
uprising.” 

The suggestion was wasted on Di 
Guaard, who was rounding the 
table with a maniacal expression of 
glee on his face. His gross hands 
were shaping themselves to fit 
Ren’s throat. 

“Shall I tell you, merchant, 
the real purpose of your visit? 
You’re an agent of the Tyrene 
trying to cause dissension and to 
divert my attention. You want to 
get your ships up the Aprillo while I 
turn my back to watch Thirdhill for 
the rising of a few slaves. Well, 
you’ve not succeeded. I’ve been 
watching your wily tricks too long. 
I know you — and I know you’re out 
there waiting for the chance to 
strike. Do you take me for a fool?’"* 

R en retreated uneasily before 
^ the big man’s advance. He 
was not sure but the fellow’s 
derangement might extend to his 
doing actual physical damage. And 
Ren did not dare to draw his 
blaster — circumstances might force 
him to use it. He could kill Di 
Guaard in self-defense, but the po- 
litical repercussions would certainly 
end the company’s tenure on 



Roget. He continued his protests 
while the madman stalked him with 
a grim and ferocious amusement. 

Finally he realized that flight was 
the 'Only sensible expedient. 
Gauging his distance carefully, he 
ran for the door and slammed it be- 
hind him. Something heavy and ce- 
ramic shattered to pieces against 
the wood inside the room. From the 
insane laughter that followed he de- 
duced that Di Guaard was unlikely 
to continue in pursuit, but for Ren 
the incident was a humiliating 
failure. He was not going to gain 
from Di Guaard the support he 
needed. 

In an alcove at the head of the 
stair Ren found Sonel Taw osten- 
sibly waiting to escort him out of 
the establishment. Ren thought it 
more than probable that Taw had 
been listening at Di Guaard’s door 
and had been surprised by the sud- 
den emergence of the visitor. Since 
the castellan would probably be 
called upon to account for why he 
had allowed a Tyrene spy to enter 
his master’s presence, Ren did not 
blame the man for seeking infor- 
mation in order to prepare his lies 
in advance. The life of a castellan in 
the service of Di Guaard could cer- 
tainly be no sinecure. 

This conjecture, however, was 
not an idle thought. If Sonel Taw 
took the trouble to keep himself 
fully informed of everything that 



116 



IF 




took place in the castle he could 
probably be of more use to the 
company’s cause than Di Guaard 
himself. Ren decided to test the 
truth of this proposition. When 
they were safely out of the keep and 
crossing the inner bailey he turned 
to Taw meaningfully. 

“The Lord Di Guaard is plenti- 
fully supplied with information re- 
garding the whereabouts and move- 
ments of pirates. I find this odd, 
since common consent has it that 
the pirates are no more.” 

The castellan looked past him 
carefully. 

“It could be,” he said, “that com- 
mon consent is wrong. Agent Ren. 
Di Guaard has many spies. They 
report frequently and are rewarded 
with coin. It has been suggested 
that many of the things they tell are 
more than the truth, since they are 
well paid for what they say. But 
there’s another who tells much and 
yet asks nothing in return.” 

“Specifically who?” asked Ren. 

“Your friend the Imaiz/* Taw 
was craftily watching the agent out 
of the corners of his eyes. “He 
claims to keep watch over the in- 
land waters and brings special 
reports regularly to Lord Di 
Guaard. Di Guaard is always much 
pleased to see him, and the wizard 
quiets his tantrums considerably. 
With so much impressive support 
for the existence of pirates, do you 



think it wise for you or me to disbe- 
lieve?” 

The castellan was purposely 
mocking his own words, hinting at 
the existence of a conspirac^^a 
development Ren had already de- 
duced for himself. If Di Guaard 
was mad enough to believe that the 
Tyrene plunderers still functioned 
others could gainfully manufacture 
evidence in support of that belief. 
For some the incentive was ob- 
vious — a purse full of money. For 
others, such as Sonel Taw and 
members of the castle household, 
support of the myth probably 
meant the continuance of their 
livelihood and possibly their lives. 
But what had Dion-daizen to gain 
from the charade? 

“Do you know why I came to see 
Di Guaard today?” 

S ONEL TAW shrugged. His 
wizened old face wrinkled with 
guile. “Anharitte is full of the news 
that you and the Imaiz have joined 
in feud. It’s reasonable to assume 
that you came here looking for an 
ally.” 

“A fair assumption.” Ren looked 
at him searchingly. “But I didn’t 
find one. At least not in Delph Di 
Guaard. But now 1 ask myself 
about you.” 

“To help you in a feud against the 
Imaiz?** Sonel Taw was obviously 
worried by the suggestion. 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



117 




“Not actively, of course,” Ren 
reassured him. “But I need infor- 
mation about Dion-daizan. I need 
to know why he humors Di Guaard 
and what he might gain from such a 
curious association. Fd like to be 
informed of when he visits Castle 
Di Guaard — at what hour he’s 
likely to return from such visits and 
what routes he’ll most probably 
use. In short, I need to know 
anything about Dion-daizan that 
might conceivably be turned to his 
disadvantage. And if your ear is as 
well affixed to locks as it appears to 
be you’ll already know that the 
company has an excellent history of 
rewarding its friends for their time 
and vigilance.” 

“I’ve often heard as much,” said 
Sonel Taw. “And that’s the type of 
friendship a man could learn to ap- 
preciate. But if someone made 
this information available to 
you — would it be certain that no 
news of it ever got back to Di 
Guaard?” 

“All information is treated in the 
strictest confidence. Nothing can 
ever be traced back to its source 
through me. Nor do I keep records 
of what moneys have been paid. Or 
to whom.” 

“Then I think you may have 
gained another friend,” said Taw. 
“Not that I would hold any man of 
Di Guaard’s household capable 
of subversion — but should a 



messenger be received claiming to 
have been sent by me, it would seem 
reasonable that he might be be- 
lieved. And if a friend might bless 
my savings so that they multiply I 
should not, through humility, be 
offended.” 

“I’ll bear that in mind,” Ren 
said. “I’m a believer in humility’s 
achieving its just rewards. You 
know, talking with you has been an 
education. I’m sure my knowledge 
of events in Castle Di Guaard will 
improve.” 

They had passed from the inner 
bailey to the outer during this con- 
versation and were now entering 
one of the two formidable 
gatehouses that gave access to the 
town. Upon Sonel Taw’s approach 
the guard sprang meticulously into 
action. Taw had merely to wave his 
hand to initiate the raising of the 
portcullis. In the roof of the gate 
tunnel were slits through which all 
kinds of merciless fire and bolts 
could be discharged. Beyond it, the 
gate of heavy wood plated with iron 
lay between the overseeing 
flanking-towers. Farther still the 
outward path was confronted by the 
outworks of a barbican tower. 

Ren made a mental note that no- 
body could enter or leave without 
Sonel Taw’s permission and the 
cooperation of the guards. By a 
mental inversion he decided that 
the walls and gates, being im- 



118 



IF 




pregnable to all save modern tech- 
nological assault, not only formed a 
rare defense position — but would 
also make a very secure prison. He 
had no immediate use for this infor- 
mation, but he stored it in his mind 
for future reference. There were 
some advantages in being an out- 
worlder — it gave him a unique per- 
spective on installations tradi- 
tionally designed for specific local 
purposes. Ren felt that his tenure in 
Anharitte, as elsewhere, was bound 
to generate some new values and he 
was determined to be the first not 
only to recognize but also to apply 
these altered truths to the com- 
pany’s and his own advantage. 

X 

HE walked back past the way- 
ward, half-timbered houses of 
the quaint alleys and streets, Ren’s 
speculations were soon eclipsed by 
a more immediate concern. His 
recent conversation with Alek 
Hardun had shaken him severely. 
Hardun had been introduced as a 
professional trouble shooter. Ren 
now felt that Hardun’s real 
function was that of a professional 
trouble-maker. The equipment in 
the space-going laboratory that was 
the battle crusier was directed pri- 
marily to one end — the sophisti- 
cated extermination of people. 

For all his merchant-acumen and 

THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



ambition, Ren still had reservations 
about the deliberate taking of life. 
His worldliness had inured him to 
the fact that some extremes of 
provocation could only be resolved 
by bloodshed. In self-defense or fair 
fighting, losers were apt to have to 
pay the irrevocable penalty. This 
was a fact of life and Ren accepted 
it, but Hardun’s projected subtle 
poisoning of dozens-pif not hun- 
dreds — of people who would be 
mainly unaware that they were the 
subjects of an attack stuck in Ren’s 
throat. This he regarded as an at- 
rocity, a treatment suitable for the 
extermination of lice and vermin 
but not to be confused with the hu- 
mane waging of a battle. 

Alek Hardun had chided Ren for 
expressing these sentiments. 

“You’re confusing the issues, 
Tito,” he had said. “You were born 
several centuries too late. We know 
the ancients used to impose rules on 
warfare, presumably to prolong the 
enjoyment of the game. But the 
brutal fact is that we’re not 
here to. fight— we’re here to win. 
I’ve offered you a dozen virtually 
foolproof ways of winning and 
you’ve rejected them all because of 
some romantic notion that the 
enemy deserves a chance. 

“Do you think the bowmen stood 
a chance when the cannon was in- 
vented? Do you think the artillery 
stood a chance against the in-^ 

119 





troduction of nuclear weapons? 
Within the whole spectrum of de- 
vices for furthering man's inhu- 
manity to man, you have the te- 
merity to stop at some arbitrary 
point and say: ‘Death devices on the 
left are sporting and humane while 
those on the right aren’t.’ Such a 
stand is neither logical nor in- 
telligent. And if you can’t bring 
yourself to do the job you’ve started 
to do I’m damned if I won’t finish it 
for you.” 

There had been more, a lot more. 
Ren had become increasingly angry 
and Hardun had become more 
professionally cruel and taunting. 
He had effectively dismantled 
Ren’s plans to conduct a campaign 
against the Imaiz and had produced 
alternative suggestions which Ren 
could only regard with horror. The 
effect of that conversation had lin- 
gered a long time in Ren’s mind 
and he was determined to compare 
the strength of his convictions with 
those of the director. Vestevaal, un- 
fortunately, had been away for 
several days, making a tour of com- 
pany trading installations, and Ren 
had been left with the question fes- 
tering in his mind. 

When Ren reached his office 
chambers the director still had not 
returned. Ren found instead that 
his computer printout terminal had 
been busy. In it lay the precious list 
of slaves carefully culled from re- 



constructed histories to shoAv those 
who could most possibly be agents 
of the Imaiz. He scanned the list 
anxiously, but the names meant 
nothing to him. For Catuul Gras, 
who knew everyone and everything 
in Anharitte, the situation would be 
different. Ren stuffed the list into 
his pocket and hastened to the 
Lodge of the Society of Pointed; 
Tails. 

USUAL, the senior scribe was 
expecting him. Ren specu- 
lated that there must be very few 
movements of importance of which 
the Pointed Tails were unaware, 
such was the superlative nature of, 
their spy web in Anharitte. He laid 
the list before Catuul, who 
examined it carefully. For some 
unstated reason his enthusiasm was 
not apparent. 

“I’ll have our slave masters inves- 
tigate this without delay — but 
discreetly. No word of it must get 
out until we’re sure. If the suspects 
became suspicious it would be easy 
for them to desert back to Magda.” 

“I’ll leave it to you,” said Ren. 
“But it’s still action only in a 
negative sense. It’s a defensive 
move. What I must have from you 
is some scheme with a positive 
effect.” 

“And you’ll have it, friend Tito. I 
promised you a scheme of feud and 
harassment against Dion-daizan 




120 



IF 




and this has now been prepared. To 
your outworld eyes it may seem a 
little superficial — but believe me, in 
terms of effectiveness in Anharitte 
its cumulative value is equivalent to 
a major disaster.” 

“I’ll accept that you know what 
you’re doing. But time’s becoming 
critical, Catuul. I’m under pressure 
to destroy the influence of the 
Imaiz and to do it fast. If your 
scheme can’t produce results 
quickly we’ll be forced into taking a 
more direct line and attacking 
Dion-daizan himself.” 

“What sort of time-scale did you 
have in mind?” 

“I think a couple of weeks only. 
Hardun is already campaigning 
with the Freetrade Council for per- 
mission to take a tougher line. I 
think I can stall them for a while, 
but we mustn’t miss any op- 
portunity to hit Dion hard.” 

“You’re worried about some- 
thing, aren’t you, friend Tito?” The 
scribe was suddenly questioning. 

“Yes, I am. I’ve come to have a 
great deal of respect for your cul- 
ture, Catuul. As a company man I 
can’t afford to risk losing access to 
the spaceport, but outside of that 
proviso I believe you’ve a right to 
settle your problems in your own 
way and without your society’s be- 
coming unduly contaminated by 
outworld interference. But I’m 
afraid that if you don’t settle the 

THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



Imaiz soon a more ruthless faction 
among the Freetraders will bring 
such pressures to bear that An- 
haritte will never be the same place 
after.” 

“I’m aware of the situation,” said 
Catuul gravely. “I’ve seen what the 
coming of the spaceport has done to 
us unwittingly. Thus I’ve no doubt 
of what would be the outcome of 
more deliberate manipulation. 
Frankly, that’s why we opted to 
work with you. You’ve an apprecia- 
tion of what a separate identity 
means both to an individual and to 
a culture. That’s something rare in 
an outworlder.” 

“You can thank the director. I 
guess I caught my attitude from 
him.” 

“Well, here’s our proposal. Dion- 
daizan maintains many large 
estates and farms in Magda 
province. The value of the produce 
is a major source of Magda’s 
income.” 

“More than the spaceport 
revenue?” Ren was learning some- 
thing new. 

“Certainly much more. But the 
point I wish to m^ke is that the 
Imaiz success in his estate policy 
depends on close coordination of 
the various estates and markets. If 
we destroy that coordination, his 
growing and marketing schemes 
will fall apart. Prices will rise, set- 
ting popular sysmpathy against 

121 




him — and he will soon acquire huge 
stocks of surplus. He will also find 
himself with excess manpower and 
will be forced to start selling slaves 
on a massive scale. A disaster of 
such consequence will smash his 
myth of omnipotence as nothing 
else will.” 

“How could you bring this, 
about?” asked Ren. 

“Dion operates a schedule of run- 
ners who daily travel between the 
various marketing centers and 
estates. We could stop a high pro- 
portion of these runners getting 
through — and in some cases sub- 
stitute false messages of our own.” 

Ren was enthusiastic. “When an 
organization as large and as dis- 
persed as that hits communications 
trouble, things can come wildly 
unstuck. How long would it take to 
show real effect?” 

“Many weeks, I’m afraid. But 
the main harvests are nearly due. If 
Dion were left with those on his 
hands he’d be in real trouble both 
with his estates and with the popu- 
lations he normally supplies. Of 
course, he’ll send out armed pa- 
trols to try and prevent our in- 
terference — but the clansmen were 
born to the game and Dion doesn’t 
have anything like the army he’d 
need to stop us.” 

“So all you really require to bring 
the Imaiz to his knees is sufficient 
time?” 



“Time and money. I want to 
bring in some of the provincial 
societies, because the area to be 
covered is immense. Though we 
shall start hurting the Imaiz im- 
mediately, the effect won’t be ap- 
parent in the markets for some 
weeks. Therefore you’ve got to hold 
off the Freetraders while we do it 
our way.” 

“I don’t have that much influence 
myself, but I’ll try to make the di- 
rector see the sense of it. In the 
meantime, muster your forces and 
make a start. If we can get a good 
scheme under way we’ll have a sure 
method of resisting those who want 
to do it the rough way.” 

V 'ESTEVAAL, on his re- 
turn, gravely heard out Ren’s 
problems. 

“I wasn’t aware that Hardun was 
here in any capacity other than a 
technical backup for you. I know 
he has an allegiance to Renee, but 
this is our fight. You’ve every right 
to complain if he’s contemplating 
any actions other than those specifi- 
cally agreed to by you. I respect 
your judgment on this issue. Tito, 
and I’m damned if I’m going to see 
you pressured into making a mis- 
take.” 

“I’ve seen his copy of the 
Freetrade security subcommittee 
directive giving him power to act on 



122 



IF 




Roget. And that battle cruiser of 
his is a fully equipped civil murder 
weapon. So I want a plain answer, 
Director — am I in charge here or 
has Hardun the right of unilateral 
action? Because I want no part of 
some of the ideas he’s outlined to 
me. 

“You say you’ve seen his di- 
rective? Can you recall who signed 
it?’’ 

“Po Cresado, as I remember.’’ 

“Damn! I thought as much. The 
merchant-world pressure lobby. 
You can take it from me, Tito, that 
his directive doesn’t have the 
consent of the full council. Unfortu- 
nately the merchant worlds do pre- 
dominate on the security subcom- 
mittee. It looks as though the 
internal political battles of the 
council have become extended to 
include affairs on Roget,’’ 

“Are you going to let them get 
away with it?’’ 

“Of course not. But it’ll take a 
full council session to settle the 
issue. I’m afraid I’ll have to return 
there to get the matter .straight. Do 
you think you can contain things 
until I get back?’’ 

“I’ll try, but I’ve no jurisdiction 
over Hardun in the face of that di- 
rective. And if he thinks you’re out 
to stop him, he’s likely to move 
fast.” 

“Then try pretending to work 
with him for a while. It might just 



be that he’ll actually do the job for 
you — and at a fraction of the price. 
Though I fear that even our friend 
Alek may not find the project as 
easy as he thinks.” 

“Can you explain that to me?” 

“I mean the Imaiz himself is 
under no doubts about Hardun or 
his infernal space machine.” 

“How could you possibly know 
that?” 

“My dear Ren, what do you 
think Zinder and I talked about 
while we were waiting to register 
her bond? She gave me Dion’s ulti- 
matum — either I remove Hardun 
and the battle cruiser or Dion- 
daizan will do the job himself. Until 
now I’ve had reservations. But from 
what you’ve just told me I can see 
the justification. I’ll set out to have 
Hardun and his ship removed — but 
don’t feel surprised if somebody 
does the job for me.” 

“I’ve told Catuul to go ahead 
with his plan to cause disruption of 
Dion-daizan’s estate-management 
policies. That will at least give me a 
lever I can use to slow Hardun 
down. But it will be difficult to stop 
him if he does want to try a decisive 
strike of his own.” 

“Then play it carefully, Tito. 
Take advantage of his successes 
and don’t become implicated in his 
failures. That way you stay on top 
and the name of the company stays 
clean.” 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



123 




“You’ve just expressed a 
philosophy,” said Ren, “that 
makes me appreciate why you have 
so much influence in the Freetrade 
Council. You never lose, do you?” 

“I can’t afford to lose,” said 
Magno Vestevaal seriously. “And 
believe me. I’ve a few tricks up my 
sleeve the rest of the council haven’t 
even thought of yet. If all goes well 
at the council meeting. I’ll probably 
go on to Terra before returning 
here. I’ve been developing a few 
thoughts of my own about how to 
deal with the Imaiz — and if I can 
get acceptance of my ideas on Terra 
I can assure you that Alek Hardun 
won’t be rated as any serious sort of 
competition.” 



XI 

F ollowing through on the 

next part of his campaign to 
seek influence with the Anharitte 
nobility. Ren had dispatched a 
message to Krist Di Rode 
requesting an audience the 
following morning. The reply was 
favorable. Before he retired, 
however, Ren took advantage of 
the caution offered by Di Irons — he 
posted a guard on his chambers lest 
the Imaiz should feel inclined to 
take the initiative. An attempted 
assassination did not seem likely, 
but Ren had been an agent long 



enough to learn that warnings from 
an indigenous source were better 
not disre^garded. Fortunately the 
night passed without incident and, 
at the appointed hour the next day, 
Ren traveled to the most eastern 
point of Firsthill and presented 
himself at Castle Di Rode. 

The contrasts between this estab- 
lishment and that of Di Guaard 
made him realize what a fortune Di 
Guaard must spend on useless 
defense projects. Di Rode was a 
prodigious spender, but his con- 
siderable income from spaceport 
revenues had not been wasted. 
Castle Di Rode was bathed in an at- 
mosphere of opulence and splendor. 

Though the castle was slightly 
smaller than that of Di Guaard, it 
differed in none of its essential fea- 
tures except that the walls and 
mural towers of Di Rode displayed 
none of the former’s austerity of 
outline. Here the masonry was fully 
overgrown with a magnificent 
wealth of copper-burnished creep- 
ing vines, which garnished the old 
stone like an overlay of finely 
wrought metal. Expenditure on the 
guard was nominal, and mainly 
slaves and serving-men in splendid 
costumes tended the gatehouses 
and the trim gardens. 

Everywhere Ren sensed the hand 
of a connoisseur of gracious living, 
not the least extravagance being the 
maintenance of the gardens and the 



124 



IF 




beautiful decoration of the halls. Di 
Rode was obviously an intellectual 
and an artist, possessed of an un- 
erring sense of the overall unity of 
his establishment as an aesthetic 
whole. The numerous slaves were 
well tended ai^d nourished and 
probably chosen for their clean, 
straight limbs and physical fitness. 
In the whole castle he discerned not 
one slave whose back bore the 
telltale scars of whip or wire. The 
whole atmosphere was one of se- 
renity and quietude. This, thought 
Ren, was the way money was in- 
tended to be spent. 

The keep of Castle Di Rode was 
built into the southeast extremity of 
the inner bailey. It held a com- 
manding view over the Aprillo river 
and across the shipping lanes that 
connected with the inland water- 
ways, The keep itself was no longer 
a simple structure. Later buildings 
along the walls of the inner bailey 
had crept around the base of the 
round-tower and risen to a height 
equal to the walls themselves. Thus 
the entrance to the keep was no 
longer gained by crossing a sterile 
courtyard, but rather through a de- 
lightfully random series of halls, li- 
braries, galleries, corridors and 
sweeping staircases. 

As Ren followed his young slave- 
caste guide he found himself, unac- 
countably at first, becoming in- 
creasingly discomforted. This 



feeling was in part associated with 
the increasing richness of the per- 
fumes and incense with which the 
air was saturated, but this was only 
a factor and not the prime cause of 
his unease. A gradual analysis of 
his feelings made him conscious of 
the fact that the rooms through 
which he passed were in a careful 
sequence of ascending extravagance 
and descending taste, and had al- 
ready attained a level where the 
lavish dissipation of resources made 
nonsense both of the function and 
the intrinsic value of the items in- 
volved. This was so extreme a con- 
trast with the exterior of the castle 
and the earlier rooms, that the only 
answer that suggested itself to Ren 
was that Di Rode, like Delph Di 
Guaard, was beset by advancing 
madness. 

Ren’s senses protested the 
wrongness they recorded. When he 
reached the confines of the keep it- 
self his feelings heightened to revul- 
sion despite his efforts to contain 
them. Here was monumental waste 
with neither art nor comfort to 
commend it. Even the occasional 
alcoves were lit by candelabra 
mounted on the heads and shoul- 
ders of undraped slaves who 
stood with statuesque patience, 
performing a function no more im- 
portant than could have been 
achieved by an iron pin driven into 
the wall.

T ^HIS final debasement of living 
humanity caused Ren as acute 
a pain as he had experienced on 
seeing the degraded labor force at 
Castle Di Guaard. Profitable ex- 
ploitation of others was a human 
weakness Ren could comprehend. 
To waste members of the species by 
forcing them to fill functions 
usually performed by inanimate ob- 
jects was, in his view, irrational and 
completely indefensible. Fortu- 
nately he regained both his outward 
composure and his objectivity be- 
fore he turned the final corner to 
come face-to-face with Krist Di 
Rode himself. 

He needed all his resources to 
contain his amazement. He had 
been shown into a bare cell, whose 
stone walls were as stark and 
undressed as had been the human 
candelabra he had passed. A high, 
square window without glazing 
looked out only to the blankness of 
an empty sky, and the shaped 
wooden bench on which the Lord 
Di Rode reclined offered no 
possible aspect of comfort. The 
floor of stone flags was unrelieved 
by carpet and the ceilings of arched 
stone had neither light nor beauty. 

Di Rode himself was also a shock 
to Ren. He had imagined an older, 
more sophisticated type of man, 
perhaps one trying to ward off old 
age by the frantic pursuit of new ex- 
perience. Instead, he was con- 




fronted by a pallid figuiyof a man 
in his early thirties,j^4rith a face 
which epitomized dissipation and 
overindulgence yet still possessed 
an undeniable strength. Ren had 
the feeling that this curious lord 
had tried and become dissatisfied 
with almost every aesthetic and 
sensual experience known to man. 
The physical dissolution was 
manifest, but the evidence was that 
the intellectual and aesthetic 
interest was yet unquenched. While 
Di Rode’s face held a searching 
interest and unquestionable in- 
telligence, it was obvious that 
unrestricted wealth, like absolute 
power, had wrought a remarkable 
corrosion on its own^^ 6 

With a trader’s acumen Ren had 
summarized this much of the man 
before he began to speak, subtly 
modifying his arguments in order to 
stress aspects of Dion-dai^n’s ac- 
tivities that might have an effect on 
Di Rode. The latter listened to him 
attentively, stopping him occa- 
sionally to query some chain of fact 
that led to Ren’s conclusions. Then 
he remained for a long period in 
contemplative thought. 

“To summarize. Agent Ren, 
you’ve presented an excellent case 
predicting what Dion’s policy might 
take away from me. But you’ve 
mentioned nothing about the loss of 
what I receive from Dion while I re- 
main his friend.”

IF 




“We have access to the resources 
of all the known universe,” said 
Ren. “There’s nothing that Dion 
can supply that we can’t better. 
Nothing at all.” 

“Does that include under- 
standing?” Di Rode was quietly 
mocking. “Do you have access to 
some cosmic source of that?” 

The unexpectedness of the 
question fazed Ren momentarily. 
“I don’t follow you.” 

“Think about it. If you had an 
unrestricted opportunity to indulge 
whatever whims you chose — how 
long would it take you to destroy 
yourself?” 

“I don’t know,” admitted Ren. 
“I’d at least have one hell of a fine 
time finding out.” 

“Spoken with all the compla- 
cency of one who’ll never have the 
opportunity! But what does a man 
need when he’s tasted everything, 
satiated every appetite and yielded 
to every conceivable temptation?” 
Ren did not answer. The question 
was beyond the scope of his 
imagination. 

Di Rode continued. “He needs 
understanding. He needs discipline. 
He needs a father-figure who’ can 
pick up the mess he’s become, 
squeeze out the rot and put back 
enough self-respect for the man to 
become a man again. That’s what 
Dion supplies to me — psychological 
rehabilitation. He picks up the 



pieces when I’ve torn myself apart 
and establishes new values to re- 
place those I’ve lost. Dp you have 
something better to offer as a re- 
placement for Dion’s prowess with 
people?” 

“We have doctors — ” 

“Doctors are for the sick,” said 
Di Rode cuttingly. “I’m not 
sick— just unusually privileged. 
With Dion’s aid 1 can probably 
crowd the pleasures of a hundred 
lifetimes into one. So you see, Ren, 
there’s nothing you can offer me in 
exchange for my allegiance. 
Wizards don’t come in tonnage 
lots.” 

Ren was about to make a reply 
when Di Rode got up from the 
bench and made as though to call a 
servant. The agent’s gaze did not 
follow the hedonistic lord, but re- 
mained fixed in fascination on the 
bench from which De Rode had 
risen. He saw now for the first time 
that the entire surface was covered 
with upward-pointing metal spines, 
like a bed of nails. In an agony of 
realization his eyes traveled in- 
voluntarily to Di Rode’s back. 

Krist Di Rode was watching his 
perplexity with some amusement. 
With a swift movement he dropped 
the single drape that covered his 
back and allowed Ren to examine 
his flesh. There were slight indenta- 
tions from the pressure of the 
barbs, but otherwise the skin was 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



127 




undamaged. In contrast, however, 
the open weave of the drape had 
been severely cut. Ren looked again 
to the sharp spines of the couch and 
again back to Di Rode. By any 
normal reasoning, Di Rode’s back 
should have been lacerated to an 
extremely serious extent. Instead, 
the young lord was laughing and 
the main discomfort was Ren^s. 

“Well, Agent Ren — do you still 
think you can do better than Dion- 
daizan?” 

Ren shook his head, not trusting 
himself to speak. He suspected, not 
for the first time, that he was 
fighting a battle quite impossible 
for him to win. With Dion’s in- 
fluence removed, Delph Di Guaard 
would go berserk and Krist Di 
Rode would destroy himself. With 
such powerful nobility removed, the 
social structure of the three hills, 
undermined as it was, would slowly 
begin to disintegrate as surely as if 
the Imaiz were still pushing it. 
Dion-daizan had raised a social 
conscience and all the old forces of 
tradition would be hard-pressed to 
put that evolving creature back to 
bed. 



AS REN came to the square of 
xX the fruit market be could see 
Catuul Gras waiting for him on the 
steps of his office chambers. He 
hastened over and the scribe 



followed him to safety behind 
closed doors before he would reveal 
the nature of his concern. 

“Something’s gone wrong.” 
Catuul’s face was grave. “The list 
of slaves you gave us — it was 
incorrect.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“We took the slaves whose names 
were on the list. It didn’t seem 
right, because most of them were 
well trusted and known to us. But 
even under pressure they gave us 
absolutely nothing. Most of them 
claimed never to have been with the 
Imaiz. ” 

“Surely that’s no more than 
you’d have expected them to say?” 

“True. But on further exami- 
nation we found their statements to 
be correct. Dr. Hardun has given us i 
a list of our own sympa- 
thizers— and none of Dion’s men at 
all.” 

“Ridiculous!” 

“It’s all here.” Catual Gras laid a 
sheaf of papers on the table. 
“Check for yourself. No man on 
that list has ever spent more than 
thirty-six hours in Magda and most 
of them haven’t been there at all.” 

Scowling, Ren reached for the 
microwave communicator and 
called the spaceport. Alek Hardun 
was a long time answering. 

“Tito? What’s eating you?” 

“What in hell are you trying to 
do, Alek? That list of slaves you 



128 



IF 




sent was the diametric opposite of 
what it was supposed to represent.” 

“Now don’t run off the spool, 
Tito! You asked me to reconstruct 
histories for a selected group of 
slaves and to notify you of those 
who’d served bond with the Imaiz 
for a year or longer. That’s exactly 
what I’ve done.” 

“Correction. That’s exactly what 
you’ve not done.” Catuul tells me 
no slave on that list has spent 
longer than two days in Magada.” 

“Hold it! That wasn’t an auto- 
matic computer printout you 
received. We verified that list be- 
fore it went on transmission. 
There’s no possibility of an error in 
the data we sent you.” 

“Yet I’m assured the list is one 
hundred per cent wrong. What the 
hell’s going on?” 

“Let’s check first that you have 
the right list. Watch your computer 
terminal and I’ll give it to you 
again.” 

Ren watched as the computer 
printout began to spit forth names. 
When it had finished, he compared 
it with the papers Catuul had given 
to him. “How’s that?” asked 
Hardun. 

“It agrees with the first set 
exactly. There’s not an error in the 
pack.” 

“Yet you insist they’re not the 
names you want?” 

“The names you’ve given me are 



also on the select list of Pointed 
Tails least probable suspects.” - 
“1 see!” Hardun was serious. 
“How many names appear on your 
list, Tito?” 

“Seventeen. You should know 
— you’ve transmitted it.” 

“Not on your life. My list 
contained seventeen names, but I 
transmitted only sixteen of them.” 
“What?” 

“I said sixteen, Tito. All of whom 
I can guarantee have been at 
Magda for at least three years and 
most much longer. If you’ve just 
received a list of seventeen names, 
there’s only one conclusion — the 
list you’re receiving is not the one 
I’m transmitting. Somebody else 
has access to your terminal line. 
They’re intercepting what I’m 
sending and substituting a list of 
their own.” 

“Damn!” Ren considered the 
enormity of the prospect. Most of 
the company’s business transac- 
tions were reported via his terminal 
to the spaceport computers for 
processing and onward trans- 
mission via the FTL radio links. 
The director’s reports on the state 
of the feud with Dion-daizan went 
out over the same channel. The 
thought of unauthorized access to 
the terminal linkage made his blood 
run cold. With a chill creeping up 
his spine, he turned the instrument 
off. 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



129 




“Can you spare me some 
linesmen, Alek? My terminal is on 
a wired circuit with the spaceport. 1 
can only assume it’s been tapped.” 
“Not only tapped,” said Hardun. 
“I’d suspect that it’s being 
consistently monitored by an on- 
line computing complex compatible 
with that at the spaceport. The 
insertion of a substitute list at that 
juncture is no ijiean feat of tech- 
nology. What the hell have they got 
up there at Magda?” 

“I wish I knew. All the signs now 
are that they’ve a modern techno- 
logical workshop that can match 
anything we can produce. This has 
to put a new face on how we ap- 
proach the attack on the Imaiz 
— but I’ll take the matter up with 
you personally. I don’t even trust 
this microwave voice link now.” 
“That’s wise,” said Hardun. 
“But before 1 sign off I’ll read you 
the list of names you should have 
received.” 

He did so. Ren copied them faith- 
fully and handed the results to Ca- 
tuul Gras. The scribe compared 
them with another list and shook 
his head concernedly. 

“The names you’ve given me 
match the list of slaves who’ve es- 
caped in the last two days. We 
presume they’ve gone to Magda, 
though the evidence isn’t clear. It 
would seem the devil has recalled 
his own.” 



F inding the actual position of 
the line tap was difficult. Be- 
cause Anharitte had no telephone 
and no electric services the cus- 
tomary array of available poles was 
absent from the landscape. When 
Ren had decided to bring his office 
into the fruit market in Anharitte 
proper he had found it neccessary 
to arrange for his wire link with the 
spaceport to be laid across private 
land wherever he could purchase 
the goodwill. The line now took a 
circuitous route across roofs, 
under eaves, around gables and 
dormer windows, and generally 
progressed in a most unorthodox 
manner until it ran free of the town 
and came to the western slopes of 
Firsthill. From there it ran across 
the country on company-owned 
poles parallel to the Provincial 
Route that skirted the spaceport. 

Despite the apparent opportunity 
for interference with the line in the 
town itself it was, curiously enough, 
on one of the poles on the open 
stretch of road that the tap was 
eventually found. The line had been 
split and both ends coupled into a 
neat black cable that ran unobtru- 
sively down the pole and disap- 
peared deep into the sandy soil of 
the provincial plain. Attempts to 
trace the path of the unauthorized 
cable proved tiresome and ex- 
pensive and they were finally 
abandoned. Its general direction 



130 



IF 




was, as Ren had known it would be, 
toward Magda. The depth and se- 
curity of its lodgment showed it to 
have been buried at about the same 
time as Ren’s own cable had been 
installed. 

This latter fact alone made the 
agent squirm. A great volume of 
confidential company business had 
been fed into the line over the past 
few years. Had the Imaiz been 
operating for a trade competitor 
the company could have suffered 
extreme Ipsses as the result of this 
unanticipated leakage of infor- 
mation. There was no evidence that 
the knowledge the Imaiz must have 
gained had been used to the com- 
pany’s disadvantage — but it was a 
late time to realize that one’s com- 
mercial future lay in the hands of a 
sworn enemy. 

Nor was Ren’s temper improved 
by a further consideration. 

From his terminal, by means of 
signature codes, he had access not 
only to company computer data 
banks at the spaceport, but also to 
the spaceport’s common computer 
banks. With the right sort of inter- 
cept equipment the Imaiz, too, 
would have had similar access to 
the same data banks and, by 
extrapolation there would scarcely 
seem to have been a commercial 
transaction on Roget of which the 
master of Magda need have re- 
main^ unaware. 



As a commercial blunder the 
situation was without parallel. The 
only mitigating factor for those in- 
volved was that no one could rea- 
sonably have suspected that on a 
relatively undeveloped planet like 
Roget there existed either the 
equipment or the technology to 
make this sophisticated form of es- 
pionage a fact. The strength of 
Dion-daizan lay as much in what he 
concealed as in what he revealed. 
Wryly Ren wondered how many 
other surprises the Imaiz still had 
up his sleeve. 

XII 

D espite his growing an- 
tipathy for Alek Hardun, Ren 
was now forced to visit the 
spaceport in order to continue the 
company’s business transactions. 
This was because he suspected he 
could trust the security of neither 
the wire circuit nor the microwave 
link. Although he tried to stay out 
of Hardun’s way, it was inevitable 
that the latter would learn of his 
coming and seek him out. 

“You wouldn’t be trying to avoid 
me, would you, Tito?” 

“Why should I?” Ren’s answer 
was couched in a frame of ag- 
grieved innocence. “I’ve been very 
busy, that’s all.” 

“I just wondered.” Hardun was 
probing. “I mean, we’ve not yet 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITT^ 



131 




completed our little chat on ways of 
removing the Imaiz. And they tell 
me Director Vestevaal has made a 
hurried trip back to Freetrade 
Central. I naturally wondered what 
was brewing.” 

“I wouldn’t know. The director 
mentioned something to me about 
visiting Terra, but I’m not exactly 
in his confidence.” 

This was so patent a lie that 
Hardun did not even pretend to be- 
lieve it. 

“Very well, Tito! If you want to 
play it close to the chest that’s your 
affair. Ranee Intelligence will give 
me all the answers I need, so don’t 
let the director think he’s acting too 
cleverly.” 

“I don’t see how you’d know,” 
Ren said critically. “You’re 
scarcely in his class.” 

For a moment a spear of anger 
burned in Hardun’s eyes. Then, 
with amazing composure, he turned 
the expression of malice aside and 
overlaid it with a veneer of genial 
charm. 

“Look, Tito — I know we have 
our differences on the way the job’s 
to be done, but we’re still here for a 
common purpose. We mustn’t 
forget the Imaiz is a very clever 
enemy. Nothing could suit him bet- 
ter than to have us divided. Let’s 
not play into his hands. How’s your 
campaign going?” 

“Slowly, but I think we’ve got it 



made. The Pointed Tails have 
produced a scheme for disrupting 
Dion’s holdings right through 
Magda Province. I’ve been into it in 
detail and I don’t see how they can 
fail. Given nine months we’ll have 
the Imaiz begging for alms in the 
streets.” 

“Nine months!” The veneer of 
geniality was stretched taut. “And 
Vestevaal settled for that? It 
shouldn’t take nine days to settle a 
little issue like this. Somebody’s 
going soft,” 

“That’s your view, Alek. But you 
haven’t studied the local conditions 
as I have. Believe me, we have to 
play this one very softly.” 

“I accept that it’s your fight, 
Tito, but I’d like to make one strike 
just to prove to you that I can do as 
I say.” 

“Then make it, Alek. I don’t 
seem to be able to stop you,” said 
Ren unexpectedly. “But I’m not 
supporting you and I don’t wish to 
be implicated in any way. Further- 
more, if you make a hash of it and 
the whole thing blows up into an in- 
terplanetary row I’ll set up such a 
howl for your skin that even 
Ranee’ll have to throw you to the 
wolves. As far as I’m concerned 
you’re a Ranee combat unit and 
nothing to do with legitimate 
Freetrade at all.” 

“I can see you’ve been doing 
your homework.” Hardun’s ac- 



132 



IF 




knowledgment was a grudging ac- 
ceptance of the terms. “I’ll make 
the strike tonight and guarantee 
you undisputed access to Castle 
Magda in the morning. I’ll even 
have a squad of Ranee commandos 
standing by to do any mopping up 
that may be required. It’s about 
time you tradesmen learned that 
jobs like this were better left to 
professionals.” 

U NDER cover of the early 
darkness Hardun moved his 
murder contingent out to the plain. 
Because the whole episode was 
highly illegal in terms of Roget law, 
absolute secrecy was essential. For 
this reason the most opportune site, 
that between the Via Arens and the 
Space Canal, could not be used, for 
fear of chance observation. The al- 
ternative site was situated on the 
rising banks of the wilder country 
almost centrally between the Pro- 
vincial Route and the Old Coast 
Road. Here there was almost no 
chance of observation during the 
hours of darkness, though by day it 
would have lain under the scrutiny 
of the watchtowers and the great 
keep of Castle Di Guaard. The 
rocket’s trajectory thus lay slightljr 
over the northwest corner of 
Firsthill, but such was the precision 
of the apparatus that the chance of 
a premature fallout on the town 
was negligible. 



All day had been spent by 
Hardun’s technicians in calculating 
the course coordinates and care- 
fully calibrating the equipment to 
guarantee the pinpoint accuracy 
necessary to ensure that the deadly 
black canister was delivered pre- 
cisely inside the confines of the 
castle and not dispersed across 
Thirdhill and its township. The 
position of the central point of the 
castle had been determined with mi- 
crometers by laser triangulation. A 
radar lock from the battle cruiser 
and a second one from a manpack 
station on the northern slopes of 
Secondhill gave the necessary 
references for faultless radio 
guidance of the missile from its mo- 
bile launcher to the castle. All this 
preparation had been leisurely and 
time-consuming. Speed was not im- 
portant, but it was absolutely vital 
that the payload of sinister cargo 
fell cleanly inside the castle walls. 

The toxin had come from, a stock- 
pile of horrifying weapons on 
Ranee. Its rate of diffusion under 
all conditions of still and moving 
air were known with great 
precision. The metering and 
dispersion could be controlled to 
a nicety to permit an almost exact 
spread of effect before destructive 
. oxidation by the atmosphere 
rendered it not only harmless but 
virtually undetectable. In a situa- 
tion such as its release inside an 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



133 




isolated citadel like Magda the 
great walls themselves would serve 
somewhat to contain the dispersion, 
so that little, if any, chance existed 
of its affecting anyone outside the 
castle walls. Inside the walls its 
potential was conservatively esti- 
mated at seven thousand per cent 
overkill. By morning the best bacte- 
riologists in the universe, while they 
might have their suspicions, would 
find it impossible to produce proof 
of the deliberate nature of the hit- 
and-run plague whose one and only 
symptom was immediate death. 
The dispersion warhead was self- 
destroying and would leave no in- 
criminating remains. 

R en himself had no stomach at 
N. all for the project. Fortu- 
nately he had retained his resolve 
and refused to take any part in the 
venture. To protect the company’s 
name — in the event of any future 
investigation of the pending atroc- 
ity — he had felt it necessary that 
he should establish an inde- 
structible alibi by being seen in 
Anharitte at the time the act was 
committed. He therefore left the 
spaceport in advance of the murder 
party and traveled the Via Arena to 
pick up a crew of stave-bearers for 
his cushion-craft slightly before 
dusk. 

The garish ligroin flares of the 
trading stalls around the arena were 



well in evidence as he passed. Ren 
stopped and made a few purchases 
in order to establish his location at 
that time. The streets, as usual at 
that hour, were crowded with an 
aimless, nonchalant throng, none of 
whom seemed to appreciate any 
need for a clear and unobstructed 
highway. Mule carts, loaded to ri- 
diculous heights with straw baskets, 
seemed eternally to be in his way 
and it took Ren nearly an hour to 
negotiate the cushion-craft the two 
kilometers from the Black Rock to 
the foot of the Trade Road. Ren 
bore this ordeal with fortitude, not 
daring to express his anxiety or his 
crying need to be in a location 
where more people would recognize 
him and be able to vouch for his 
presence on that particular evening. 
Fortunately the Trade Road was 
clearer and the craft was poled 
easily up the slopes and out to the 
broad brow of Firsthill. 

It was here that he first heard the 
explosions. In reactive shock he at 
first thought that the rocket must 
have misfired on its launcher. A 
second burst of noise, however, 
caused him to notice that the origin 
of the sounds was too far to the left 
to be coming from the provincial 
plains and was more probably 
coming from the guns of Di 
Guaard. Remembering the for- 
midable chain-throwing cannon 
that Di Guaard maintained to cover 



134 



IF 




the Aprillo Delta against the 
niythical Tyrene, Ren was able to 
make a guess that Hardun was in 
trouble. The vicious cannon atop 
the castle keep were being rapidly 
deployed against something to the 
west — a fact he was able to confirm 
when his position enabled him to 
see the flashes of the guns 
themselves. It did not take much 
further conjecture to appreciate 
that the only target to be found on 
the plains at this hour was Hardun 
and his rocket projector and the 
deadly rocket with which he in- 
tended to wipe out the human — not 
to mention humane — population of 
Castle Magda. 

Ren reached his office chambers 
in a state of agonized indecision 
and suffering from an embarrassing 
lack of information. He was 
tempted to try to contact Alek 
Hardun via the microwave link, but 
there were dangers that some 
record of the conversation could 
implicate both himself and the 
company. On the face of it, the 
chances of the mad Delph Di 
Guaard’s guns being able to seek 
out a target on the dark plain ap- 
peared negligible. However, the 
hand of the Imaiz in Castle Di 
Guaard — and the awful coincidence 
of the rocket launcher on the plains 
under the speaking guns — threw up 
possibilities too haunting to be 
ignored. 



H aving parked the cushion- 
craft, Ren made his way to 
the Lodge of the Pointed Tails, 
where discreet information was 
usually available. The lodge was 
deserted save for a solitary 
guardian, who appeared to think 
the clan was already out on Ren’s 
own business and was surprised 
that the agent had no knowledge of 
the fact. He, too, had no certain 
idea of why Di Guaard’s guns were 
firing, but promised to send a run- 
ner to contact the clan and to carry 
news back to Ren as fast as 
possible. Ren returned to his office 
and sat waiting for the information. 

It was fully an hour before 
Catuul Gras came to the door. 

“We were looking for you earlier, 
Tito. Sonel Taw sent a messenger 
for you. When he couldn’t find you 
he had sense enough to come 
looking for me.” 

“I was delayed at the spaceport,” 
said Ren. “What was the 
message?” 

“That the Imaiz was expected in 
Castle Di Guaard tonight.” 

“He is?” This put a new aspect on 
Hardun’s venture with the rocket 
and Ren could not conceal his 
surprise. This was one point on 
which even Alek Hardun had 
miscalculated. 

“I laid plans for an immediate 
ambush,” said Catuul Gras, “but 
the Imaiz slipped through.” 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



135 




“Dion’s alre^idy there, then?” 
“Yes. He must have come around 
by the Provincial Route or the Old 
Coast Road. He came up Sidepath 
and was already in Castle Di 
Guaard before we got the news.” 
“Was anyone with him?” 

“Only Zinder and Barii, I think.” 
“Have you any idea what Di 
Guaard’s firing at?” 

Catuul smiled. “I suspect the 
Imaiz put him up to it. It’s said 
Dion carries strange tales about the 
Tyrene to Di Guaard. I’d wager the 
mad Delph is on top of his tower 
right now, firing at imaginary 
pirates and believing himself to be 
the saviour of Anharitte. Still, it’s 
better that he fires across the 
plains. There’s no one out there to 
hurt. Safer than firing at the ship- 
ping on the river.” 

Ren felt cold and rather sick. Be- 
cause of the atrocious nature of the 
weapon Hardun had taken out into 
the plain not even the Pointed Tails 
had been made party to the secret. 
The presence on Roget of such a 
potent outworld mass-murder 
instrument was not something that 
Ren cared to advertise — nor would 
the knowledge have helped his 
liaison with the loyal but native 
clan whose services he so frequently 
employed. His one consolation was 
that without radar and ranging 
instruments, the mad Di Guaard 
was unlikely actually to hit the 



rocket launcher. More probably,? 
Hardun would abandon the venturcj 
and retire to the security of the1 
spaceport. However, if Hardun 
continued his plan and launched the 
bio-missile into Magda, then he 
would certainly fail to kill the one 
man on Roget who could unearth 
the truth behind the death of the 
garrison at Magda. The damage the 
Imaiz could do with that truth both 
on Roget and with the Galactic 
Federal Council could not only see 
an end to the freeport but could 
work against Freetrade right across 
the galaxy. 

The agent became aware that the 
scribe was watching him curiously. 

“What’s on your mind, Tito?” 

“Nothing,” Ren lied. “But so far 
our feud against the Imaiz has been 
a continuing series of failures. I 
can’t afford more. We know the 
Imaiz is in Castle Di Guaard and 
that some time he’s going to have to 
come out. I don’t care what it costs, 
Catuul, or how many other 
societies you need to reinforce your 
own men, but 1 want the Imaiz 
ambushed — and I want him killed. 
I want you to make it a point of 
honor that he never returns to 
Magda.” 

Catuufs intelligent eyes were 
probing gently, but he made no 
comment on his conclusions. 

“As you wish, Tito. I’ll make all 
the necessary arrangements. We’ll 



136 



IF 




seal Castle Di Guaard like a trap. 
No matter when Dion-daizan 
emerges there’ll be good shafts and 
good steel waiting for him. If he 
ever sees Magda again it’h be solely 
due to his wizardry.” 

Because there was nothing else he 
could usefully do Ren went to bed 
and tried to sleep. In this he was for 
many hours unsuccessful because 
he had no idea at all what pattern of 
news would greet him the next day. 
The possibilities ranged from 
brilliant success to tragic failure, 
with a range of complex permuta- 
tions in between, many of which 
could involve him in being asked 
some acutely embarrassing ques- 
tions. Even the certainty of failure 
would have allowed him to rest 
more easily, but he was currently 
immersed in a vacuum containing 
no answers, from which he dared 
not emerge to ask questions lest he 
betray his own foreknowledge. His 
surest method of defense was to 
profess complete ignorance of the 
events that took place that night, 

F inally, however, he must 
have slept for a while. He woke 
again to the first gray of dawn, 
feeling wretched and compelled by 
curiosity to cohtact the spaceport 
by the microwave radio link. As he 
dressed and dragged himself down- 
stairs the call alarm of his trans- 
receiver gave a clatter that made 



him stop in startled shock. It was 
many seconds before he could bring 
himself to lift the handset. 

“Tito?” 

“Alek — what happened?” 
“Happened?” Hardun’s tone 
alone foreshadowed the tale of di- 
saster. “Di Guaard’s cannon hit the 
launcher. The toxin dispersion 
canister went off prematurely and 
all six of the crew were dead of the 
plague inside five minutes. There 
was nothing I could do to help 
them.” 

“What about yourself?” 

“I was lucky. I was following up 
in the radio unit truck. Di Guaard 
wrapped one of his chain-shots 
around the turret and I stopped to 
estimate the damage. By the time I 
got going again the launcher was on 
its side and the crew was trying to 
run. I reversed out fast and called 
out the medical team from the 
spaceport. They got there in twenty 
minutes, but when they knew what 
toxin we had in the canister they re- 
fused to go in. It wouldn’t have 
been much use anyway. Once that 
toxin’s out there’s no protection 
against it and only time and ex- 
posure can counter it.” 

“So we’ve a broken rocket 
launcher and six bodies out on the 
plain in full view of Di Guaard’s 
watchtowers when the light gets 
better. Damn! Di Irons will flay us 
for this.” 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE

“It’s still pretty misty out here. I 
think we’re covered until the sun 
comes over the hill. That gives us 
an hour yet to remove the mess. 
I’ve emergency tenders standing by, 
but we’re trying to delay for as long 
as possible so that the toxin is fully 
broken down. We daren’t risk 
losing any more men. What in the 
name of Jupiter possessed Di 
Gua^rd to open fire like that?” 

“You don’t know the hell of it,” 
said Ren. “Even if you’d succeeded 
you’d still have been in trouble. The 
Imaiz wasn’t at Magda. He was 
with Di Guaard. I suspect he was 
directing operations, having first 
explored the situation for himself. 
At a guess, he had all your prepara- 
tions under observation — and you 
drove straight into a trap.” 

“That would figure,” said 
Hardun sourly. “We were the vic- 
tims of good espionage, perfect 
tingling and diabolical ranging ac- 
curacy 1 had the feeling that if the 
chain shots hadn’t stopped us they 
would have been followed up by 
high explosives. As it was, the bom- 
bardment stopped shortly after the 
launcher got into trouble, as though 
they knew they had hit something 
vital. What are the chances of their 
having an infrared ranging camera 
at Castle Di Guaard?” 

“Every chance — with the Imaiz 
behind them.” 

“Tito, we’ve got to destroy this 



man — and fast — or we haven’t a 
hope of retaining Anharitte as a 
freeport.” 

“I’ve got him bottled inside 
Castle Di Guaard,” said Ren. 
“Catuul’s mustering a whole army 
and we’ll keep them in position for 
as long as may be required. I don’t 
myself think Dion will attempt to 
come out. I think he’ll sit there and 
wait for us to go away.” 

“Then this strikes me as an op- 
portune time to try a recon- 
naissance raid on Magda. 1 have 
the commandos assembled, but I’ll 
be too busy on the plain to take the 
lead. Could you handle it for me, 
Tito?” 

“I’ve no great objection to a re- 
connaissance. And it might produce 
some useful information.” 

“Good. I’ll have the men meet 
you at Magda Crossing in an hour’s 
time.” 

“I’ll be there,” said Ren and went 
thoughtfully in search of breakfast. 

XIII 

T 'HERE was no doubt from 
close quarters that Castle 
Magda was the most formidable of 
all the fortresses on the three hills. 
It was larger than the installation of 
Di Guaard, yet planned with the 
same paranoiac approach — the 
supposition that all men’s hands 
were against it. The outer walls of 



138 



IF 




massive granite blocks were 
probably solid for twenty meters at 
the base and rose sheer out of the 
waters of an unwelcoming moat. 
Even the dark streaks in the granite 
conspired to give the place an air of 
unassailable endurance. 

Whoever had planned and built 
Magda had been a genius in his own 
right. There was not an inch of the 
wall that was not overlooked by 
some flanking tower, and all 
possible angles of approach lay 
under a dozen points from which a 
hidden defender might safely fire. It 
was not even possible to tell if one 
were being observed, so dark and 
numerous were the potential 
defense positions. 

Although they were armed, the 
group of thirty-five Ranee com- 
mandos with Ren had strict instruc- 
tions to do no more than test the 
defenses. They could indulge in a 
little provocation in order to test 
the viability of any attack 
hypothesis, but were to take no 
main offensive action unless 
instructed to do so by Ren. The 
agent had a secondary purpose in 
leading an open move against 
Magda — he hoped that news of it 
would tempt the Imaiz to try and 
break out of Castle Di Guaard. He 
had sufficient faith in the Pointed 
Tails to think that Dion-daizan was 
unlikely to make his homeward 
journey alive. 



Castle Magda was situated on the 
highest point of Thirdhill, in a 
situation remote from the attendant 
township. It stood on a rocky pla- 
teau, three^ parts of the extremities 
of which gave way to nothing but 
the slopes of a broken and inhos- 
pitable hill. Working beneath the 
cover of the slopes, the small and 
wiry commandos were split into 
three groups, each with a local of- 
ficer. 

Ren alone, a known figure in 
the territory, felt free to show 
himself openly. His presence on 
Thirdhill could not be concealed 
during daylight and he took advan- 
tage of this fact to make the survey 
he needed to complete the assess- 
ments of the high-level photo- 
graphic data on Magda. 

The intention had been that, 
having completed his open evalua- 
tion of Magda’s defense potential, 
he would rejoin the commandos for 
a mock attack to see what sort of 
response would be forthcoming 
from the garrison in the absence of 
the tmaiz. However, as h^ ap- 
proached the main gatehouse he 
was more than a little disturbed to 
find the drawbridge down and the 
great gates open and apparently un- 
guarded. Intrigued by this 
phenomenon, he ventured closer, 
the thought crossing his mind that 
in the absence of the master the at- 
titude of the remaining garrison 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



/ 



139 




seemed to be remarkably naive. 

Or was it? If the Imaiz had left 
Magda, knowing even a little of the 
threat on the plains, he might have 
evacuated his whole garrison to 
safety. In which case Hardun's 
murder weapon would have been 
completely without success even if 
it had been fired. The idea seemed 
credible. If the Imaiz s strength re- 
sided mainly in the super-training 
of his bondforce it would have been 
an unthinkable risk for him to have 
left them in the castle. 

The chances were that the gar- 
rison was now dispersed around the 
township of Magda, waiting for the 
master to come and assure them it 
was safe to return. Wary of a trap, 
Ren returned to the commandos 
behind the ridge and used their 
radio to contact his own office. His 
servant took the call and dispatched 
a runner to contact Catuul Gras. 
Instead of sending a message, 
Catuul himself came to answer. 
“Did you find anything, Tito?” 
“Yes. As near as I can tell, 
Magda’s been evacuated. Not even 
a token guard is posted. Are you 
perfectly sure the Imaiz is still bot- 
tled up in Castle Di Guaard?” 
“Quite sure. Not even a rat could 
have got out of there unnoticed. 
We’ve had every inch of the walls 
under observation since the Imaiz 
went in. What had you in mind?” 
“The occupation of Magda. I’ve 



some of Hardun’s men with me. It 
would be quite a joke if, tired of 
waiting for the Imaiz to return, the 
garrison came back to find me in 
residence.” 

“Too risky,” said Catuul gravely. 
“It’s not like the Imaiz to leave the 
slightest thing to chance.” 

“He would scarcely have had 
time to make preparations once he 
realized what was going on.” 

“And what was going on?” 

Ren realized that he had said too 
much. The Pointed Tails had not 
been given the probable reason why 
the Imaiz had found it so necessary 
to visit Di Guaard. 

“We tricked him,” said Ren ob- 
scurely. “That was why he left 
Magda. Risk it may be, but I’m 
going to try to get in there. 1 need to 
know what sort of facilities he has 
in Magda — and if we can manage 
to hold it I think our battle’s over. 
A lord dispossessed of his own 
castle won’t find much following in 
Anharitte.” 

“Let me withdraw some Pointed 
Tails and try to locate the 
whereabouts of the garrison first.” 
“No. We don’t have the time. 
And we daren’t give the Imaiz the 
opportunity to escape from Di 
Guaard. You deal with the Imaiz 
and I’ll try my luck with Magda. 
That way either or both of us has 
the chance to finish the fight for 
good.”

IF 




R en explained his proposition to 
h. the senior Ranee commando. 
He too had independently formed 
the opinion that Magda was unoc- 
cupied and nodded a ready accep- 
tance of Ren’s idea. The nien un- 
der him were battle-trained 
professionals, unused to sitting 
aside while a group of merchants 
and native warriors did the fighting 
for them. Whether or not Magda 
was defended, this was their chance 
to demonstrate what could uniquely 
be done by perfectly trained and 
equipped soldiery. 

Ren was warned to take no part 
in the initial excursion. He saw the 
wisdom of this as the small, wiry 
commandos went expertly into 
action, almost melting into the 
background as they moved up 
toward the sinister towers of the 
castle. Every move they made was 
one of marvelous precision, each 
man knowing what area he had to 
cover with his firepower and what 
need not concern him until death 
took his neighbor. With the swift 
and deceptive mobility of lizards 
they moved up the main ap- 
proaches. Some ventured onto the 
drawbridge, some crossed it, others 
held careful reserve in the deadland 
beneath it. Each time they ad- 
vanced they left nothing to chance. 
Had any resistance been offered it 
would at any time have found only 
a minimum of targets exposed. 



Finally the whole force entered 
the gateway, having assured itself 
that the entry tunnel was safe. The 
last one to enter was the senior 
commando, who signaled to Ren 
that it was safe for him to follow. 
Ren moved up quickly, feeling a 
sudden loneliness and isolation now 
that the others were no longer 
visible. The whole affair had this 
far been conducted in silence, but 
now he became extraordinarily 
aware of just how absolute that 
silence was. He quickened his pace 
and had entered the long, dark tun- 
nel of the entrance, expecting to 
find some of the commandos 
waiting for him and slightly 
perturbed to find that they were 
not. A nagging suspicion warned 
him that it had all been far too easy. 
He was still telling himself this 
when the great portcullis gates fell 
at the ends of the tunnel, trapping 
him like a wild beast in a cage. 

For his commando companions 
who had passed on into the inner 
ward the end was swift. A high-level 
stun bomb burst above their heads. 
Blastwise its effect was negligible, 
but its biological shock effect, 
caught and concentrated between 
the great walls of stone, was a dis- 
aster. All thirty-five Ranch com- 
mandoes stiffened like posts and 
then crumpled to the ground. Those 
who had not been killed were se- 
verely concussed. Some of those 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



141 




who lived would be deaf for life. 
Others would have more or less 
permanent damage to the brain and 
other organs as a result of the shat- 
tering pressure and rarefaction of 
the stun bomb shockwave. 

Caught in his cage, Ren was dealt 
agony. He held his hands over his 
screaming ears, thought the blow at 
the pit of his stomach had been 
equally severe. Fortunately the nar- 
row entrance to the tunnel and 
probably the gates themselves had 
protected him from all but a minor 
part of the shock. He rolled up and 
writhed on the dusty floor, 
oblivious to anything outside 
himself until some of the pain 
subsided. Then he climbed to his 
feet again, shaking his head to try 
and still the ringing in his ears and 
dimly thinking of escape. A brief 
examination of the portcullis, 
however, told him that his freedom, 
if gained, was going to have to be 
given by his captors. He could not 
arrange it for himself. 

T hrough the heavy fret of 
the inner portcullis he could see 
the occupants of Magda beginning 
to emerge. Some began the task of 
sorting the dead commandos from 
the living. Others examined the 
fabric of the building's walls for any 
damage that might have resulted 
from the blast. Ren looked 
miserably out upon the scene and 



wondered when and what sort of at- 
tention would be paid to himself. 
He had his blaster under his tunic^ 
but he was aware that to use it now 
could result only in his being 
destroyed like an unwanted dog. He 
might be able to make better use of 
its bargaining power in response to 
a more personal approach by his 
captors, but at this moment its 
function could be only a catalyst in 
an untidy and ignoble form of sui- 
cide. 

Finally what looked like a 
medical team began directing the 
careful removal of those who might 
possibly be saved. No one still paid 
any attention to Ren and, 
wondering if they even knew of his 
existence, he finally shouted to at- 
tract attention. Several of the slaves 
looked up and grinned in his di- 
rection. From this he deduced that 
his situation was known and that 
his incarceration was deliberate. 

It was many hours later that the 
inner portcullis was raised, and he 
emerged from the dark recess of the 
tunnel to come blinking into the 
rays of the late-afternoon sun. 
Neither a vicious guard nor a firing 
squad awaited him. Instead a 
figure, peacock proud in a wealth of 
glorious fabrics, held out her hand 
in a reserved mode of welcome. 
And this he found equally daunting. 

“Welcome to Magda, Agent 
Ren.”

IF 




“Zinder— I— ” 

“You thought 1 was with Dion in 
Castle Di Guaard. Isn’t that what 
you were going to say? To tell you 
the truth, we came back late last 
night.” 

“We? Dion-daizan too?” Ren felt 
impelled to ask the question, 
though he did not know why he ex- 
pected an answer. He found her 
openness very disconcerting. 

“And Barii.” She was teasing 
him quietly. “There was quite a 
party on at Di Guaard last night. 
But we found it far too noisy. We 
left early.” 

“Damn!” Ren looked ruefully at 
the dust on his shoes. “I must have 
at least three hundred men posted 
to stop you from leaving Firsthill. 
You people win every damn trick in 
the book. Did you know that was a 
crack Ranee commando team you. 
just destroyed? Competence is a 
tolerable sin, but omnipotence is a 
little out of fashion.” 

Zinder turned her head to survey 
the scene of the recent carnage in 
the courtyard. 

“Not omnipotence. Agent Ren. 
Careful planning, good organiza- 
tion, fast communications, a sense 
of purpose and a modicum of luck. 
The usual ingredients needed to 
make a success of any major un- 
dertaking. We offer injury to those 
who try to injure us and ridicule for 
those who try to make us look ri- 



diculous. We take an eye for a 
tooth and a life for an eye — and if 
that seems immoral, remember that 
the quarrel is not of our choosing.” 
Ren shrugged. “Then what do 
you intend to do with me?” 

She was slightly amused. “I think 
we’ll give you some supper and set 
you free again.” 

“1 can’t object to the ar- 
rangement, but the logic of it es- 
capes me.” 

“Does it? If you were we, whom 
would you rather have as an 
enemy — yourself or the Butcher of 
Turais?” 

“Butcher of Turais?” 

“So they didn’t tell even you! I’m 
not surprised. Alias Alek Hardun. 
He’s a specialist in depopulating 
awkward places. The pogrom of 
Turais was only one of his accomp- 
lishments. It was no accident that 
he happened to have access to 
Ranee toxin. And that’s not a hun- 
dredth part of the mass-murder 
equipment he carries on that blood- 
wagon of his. Frankly we think that 
you and Director Vestevaal have 
been deceived into accepting him so 
easily. And either you stop him or 
we’ll be forced to stop him 
ourselves. If Hardun comes out on 
top even Roget could become 
another sparsely populated world.” 
“I can’t accept that statement at 
its face value,” said Ren. “But I 
know the director’s worried about 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



143 




XIV 



him and is trying to take some 
action.” 

“Trying’s not enough. We were 
only able to stop Hardun below Di 
Guaard last night because we knew 
who he was and what he was ca- 
pable of. But if he’d successfully 
destroyed Magda — who could have 
stopped him then? Can’t you 
imagine the pattern? Here a lord 
goes crazy, and there another 
forgets to wake from his sleep. Mu- 
tant rust decimates the harvest and 
the seat of central government is 
stricken by history’s worst ever 
plague. Ranee drafts in a thousand 
‘disaster relief experts’ and, to 
shore a crumbling economy, ap- 
points a puppet government. Then 
it’s all over save the persecution and 
the exploitation.” 

“How much of this have you told 
Vestevaal?” 

“All of it and more. I think he 
was convinced. But he has his own 
job to do also — and this we under- 
stand. He’s a big man, your di- 
rector — but I wonder if he’s big 
enough to fight the combined 
weight of the merchant worlds. 
Only the Freetraders can contain 
them, but they’re divided and 
doubtful and prone to manipulation 
themselves. But come! Dion will ex- 
plain this far better than I. Though 
I think you’d better let me have 
your sword and your blaster before 
you meet him.” 



I T WAS midnight as Ren started 
uncertainly back down the 
twisted Roads of Thirdhill. 
Zinder had taken his blaster, 
but had returned his sword at 
the gate, so that he had no fears 
for bis own protection. His uncer- 
tainty arose from the wealth of 
damaging information Dion-daizan 
had given him concerning Alek 
Hardun, the Butcher of Turais. 

Ren had come to Magda full of 
the certainty that he was indeed 
performing a necessary job. He 
now felt himself reduced to the 
status of a dupe and an unwitting 
accomplice of a trade-world cartel 
whose methods were becoming in- 
famous throughout the universe. It 
made him wince to remember the 
number of times he had mentally 
applauded the news screen’s an- 
nouncements: Disaster teams from 
Combien and Ranee have been sent 
to the planet to offer immediate 
assistance . Once those teams ar- 
rived, he knew now, the disasters 
multiplied and the need for 
assistance changed to one of 
enforced dependence. 

On the other side of the coin, 
however, Hardun had warned Ren 
that the Imaiz would seek to divide 
his opposition and thereby ensure a 
continuance of his own schemes. 
This possible aspect of Dion’s 



144 



IF 




expert lecture had not been lost on 
Ren, though the documented evi- 
dence with which he had been 
presented was overwhelmingly in 
favor of the removal of Alek 
Hardun from the scene. Ren sensed 
that the Imaiz alone stood between 
Roget and the diabolical hands of 
Ranee and her agents. With this in 
mind, he was not at all sure that his 
own plans to damage the Imaiz 
were still justified. He reflected that 
Vestevaal, having become con- 
vinced of the truth of the situation, 
had travelled immediately offworld 
to carry the battle directly to the 
powerful Freetrade Council. Of one 
thing Ren became certain — if he 
were again to have the strength of 
his own convictions Alek Hardun 
and his murder ship must go. 

Ahead of him, among the noises 
of the night, Ren heard a sound he 
knew. To the uninitiated it was the 
call of a nightbird. Ren knew it for 
the signal of the Pointed Tails. He 
answered it inexpertly and in a few 
moments Gras was at his side. 

“What happened, Tito?” the 
scribe asked anxiously. “We had 
word that things went wrong at 
Magda and that you were captive.” 

“I was captive. But Dion-daizan 
decided to let me go again — I think 
because he likes the sporting nature 
of our opposition.” Ren’s sentence 
ended in heavy irony. 

Catuul Gras looked at him as 



though transfixed by a blade. 

“Dion-daizan in Magda? But he 
can’t be — ” 

“He’s there all right. So are 
Zinder and Barii. I’ve just taken 
supper with the three of them.” A 
sudden anger overtook him. “Are 
they smaller than mice that they 
passed your watch at Di Guaard 
and were waiting to trap me when I 
arrived?” 

In the dim light the scribe’s 
expression was one of puzzlement 
followed by a sudden relaxation. 

“Then you’ll admit now that 
Dion’s a wizard. It’s not possible 
for anything to have escaped from 
Di Guaard without our knowing. 
Not only did we have the castle and 
the exits under surveillance, but we 
also had men on the routes and 
river crossings. If Dion reached 
Magda he must have fiown like a 
bird.” 

The instant absurdity of the sug- 
gestion was soon overthrown by a 
new line of speculation in Ren’s 
mind. “I wonder if you’re right, 
Catuul. He couldn’Lhave flown like 
a bird, but he could have flown 
nonetheless. In which direction was 
the wind last night?^’ 

“There was not much wind, but 
the breeze persists from the 
southwest from now until the heavy 
weather breaks. Does that give you 
an idea?” 

“I have a suspicion. Dion 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



145 




couldn’t have used a conventional 
aircraft because you’d have heard 
the noise of engines. But if he’d had 
some sort of balloon available he 
could have used it in relative safety 
after nightfall. The natural wind- 
drift would have carried them 
toward Thirdhill or at least into 
Magda province. And the river 
lights would have given them an in- 
dication of when it was safe to 
land.” 

“What’s a balloon?” asked 
Catuul. 

“A device that figures almost 
uniquely in ancient Terran history. 
It’s a bag of gas or hot air — which 
is lighter than the air in which it 
floats. A big balloon can carry jsl 
basket containing several people. It 
could have lifted the three of them 
out of Castle Di Guaard and if you 
weren’t looking for it you’d 
never have seen it go. That way the 
Imaiz could have escaped all your 
traps without resorting to wizardry. 
It only needs the application of a 
few physical principles and a bit of 
technical know-how.” 

“Wizardry or technical know- 
how, it’s all the same to me,” said 
Catuul. “What you call wizardry 
are the things that are done which 
are beyond the limits of what your 
education insists is possible. But the 
same applies to me. So the dif- 
ference between our points of view 
is one of degree, not kind.” 



“Point taken, Catuul. But so far 
the Imaiz has done nothing beyond 
the comprehension of the averagely 
educated outworlder. This makes it 
reasonably certain that he’s not a 
native of Roget, and various his- 
torical associations about his 
schemes strengthen my belief that 
he’s a Terran.” 



T 'HE scribe was searching the 
darkness behind them, looking 
for something. Occasionally he 
would answer the low-pitched 
trade-calls that floated through the 
darkness. Finally he turned back to 
Ren and spoke. 

“Hardun’s men who were with 
you — weren’t they released too?” 
“No. All thirty-five were either 
killed or injured.” 

“I warned you it was dangerous.” 
The scribe’s face was grim. “The 
Imaiz never takes chances. And this 
fetches a point which we must settle 
between us, friend Tito. There was 
nothing in our contract about your 
carrying the fight using outworld 
soldiery. Nor about the use of long- 
range outworld weapons. If we 
were to place this fact before the 
Elders of the clans they would 
relieve the Pointed Tails of any 
further obligations to you — nor 
would you obtain clan service 
elsewhere. The Elders would never 
consent to a clan’s being party to

IF 




any out world scheme of aggression. 
I’m disappointed in you, Tito. I’d 
thought you understood us better.” 
Ren stopped walking and turned 
to face the scribe squarely. 

''I do understand you and I admit 
I’m in error. But circumstances 
overtook me. Initially I was mis- 
lead as to the reasons Alek Hardun 
came to Roget. He came under the 
guise of an advisor, but now ap- 
pears to have independent 
operating status. By the time I was 
aware of this I found I had no 
power to stop him. The director has 
gone to the council to have the mat- 
ter set to rights.” 

“Yet it was you who took the sol- 
diers to Magda,” objected Catuul. 

“True. They were available and 
the exercise was intended purely as 
a reconnaissance. But when I be- 
lieved Magda to be abandoned I 
thought that by one decisive move I 
might shorten the whole battle. 
That was a classic blunder that cost 
Doctor Hardun thirty-five men.” 
“I’d not have expected the price 
to be less.” The scribe was critical. 
“Had the Imaiz not dealt with 
them — there are two hundred 
clansmen from all over the 
provinces around us now who 
would have made sure the Ranee 
men never left Thirdhill.” 

“What?” Ren was aghast. “Do 
you really feel so strongly about 
them?” 



“We may have our internal 
disputes in Anharitte, but armed 
outworld interference transcends 
any normal act of feud. Were it not 
so, even Roget could fall under 
some outworld yoke. Think about 
it, Tito. You’ll see why it has to be 
so. And your part in this has been a 
cardinal transgression.” 

“I can’t deny it. It’s been a sad 
error both in judgment and in 
policy. Hardun’s equipment and his 
tactics have become an embar- 
rassment and were no part of my 
original intention. And I’m even 
more unhappy to have broken faith 
with your society.” 

“But in the light of today’s expe- 
dition, how much reliance can we 
place on your word. Think carefully 
before you answer— 1 may yet have 
to speak for you to the Elders of the 
clans.” 

“The Elders must decide as they 
will. And you, too, Catuul. You 
know me better than most and must 
decide for yourself. My rejection of 
Alek Hardun is a personal inability 
to support his views on the 
cheapness of human life. I can’t say 
otherwise even to save the 
spaceport or my job, which depends 
on it.” 

“That’s precisely what I wanted 
to hear,” said the scribe. “But I’ve 
been less than frank with you. The 
Elders have already discussed the 
matter in council. They gave two 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



147 




decisions. The first is that all so- 
ciety services will be withdrawn 
from outworlders until Hardun and 
his ship have been removed — ” 

“And the second?” 

“That you were to be killed 
unless I personally was satisfied 
with your intention and your in- 
tegrity.” 

“And have you come to that de- 
cision?” Ren felt his sword hang 
heavy at his side. 

“Of course.” Catuul’s smile 
broadened in the dim light from the 
night sky. “Or you would have been 
dead within minutes of leaving 
Castle Magda. Come, friend Tito, 
we have your cushion-craft waiting 
on the far side of the crossing.” 

ii ALL thirty-five men?” 
x\. Hardun’s voice reached 
the peak of incredulity. 

“It wouldn’t have mattered if 
they had been a hundred,” said 
Ren. “The Imaiz is more than a 
match for anything you can put up. 
Frankly, your tactics have become 
a liability. I’ve sent a spacegram to 
the Freetrade Council expressing 
the opinion that if you’re allowed to 
remain on Roget the spaceport 
facility will certainly be lost.” 

“You did what?” Hardun’s new 
peak of disbelief was suddenly tem- 
pered by relief. “Now I know 
you’re joking, Tito. I see copies of 
every spacegram transmitted from 



here. I know damn well you’ve sent 
no such thing.” 

“You used to see copies,” cor- 
rected Ren. “The Freetrade 
Council has already instructed the 
spaceport staff not to cooperate 
with you and they’re leaning 
heavily on Ranee to have you 
pulled out. I know of this because I 
held a personal conversation with 
the director at Freetrade Central. 
And you won’t receive a recording 
of that either. He confirmed 
everything I’d learned about the 
Butcher of Turais.” 

“Turais? That old propaganda 
line — ” Hardun was vehement. “If 
you’d believe that you’d believe 
anything.” 

“I would believe anything about 
you, Alek. That’s why I complained 
to the council. The urgency of your 
removal can’t be overstressed. 
They’re to hold a debate on it. I 
imagine the result will be to apply 
some tough sanctions against 
Ranee until they’re forced to order 
you out. I don’t imagine that’ll 
make you very popular with your 
masters, either. So I’m advising 
you now to get offworld before the 
storm really breaks.” 

“I’ll see you in hell first, Tito. I 
wouldn’t dream of moving a 
centimeter unless I get specific 
instructions from Ranee Politico.” 

“Very conformative. But I wasn’t 
asking you to go — I was warning 



148 



IF 




you not to stay. Your departure is 
imminent. Either you decamp of 
your own volition or rjin the very 
probable risk of being removed, 
perhaps violently, by someone like 
the Imaiz, And if that happens 
Ranee will be spared much loss of 
face — so I don’t imagine they’ll 
grieve unduely.” 

“The risk is negligible. It’s a 
complete certainty there’s nothing 
on Roget that can harm an armed 
battle cruiser at dock.” 

“I don’t share your certainty. 
The societies have withdrawn all 
services until your ship has been 
removed. The Imaiz not only has 
no opposition, but can probably ac- 
quire substantial assistance if he re- 
quires it. And I don’t think Di Irons 
is going to miss the point for very 
long — in which case the planetary 
government will also be involved. 
So the opposition ranged against 
you runs from Dion-daizan through 
the Freetrade Council up to 
possible intervention by the Ga- 
lactic Federation. If you get off- 
world now you might just about 
save your own skin.” 

“You’re either a brave man or a 
complete fool,” said Hardun 
savagely. “I’ve killed men before 
for offering a whole lot less 
provocation. Your outlook’s so far 
adrift from the realities of galactic 
life that you’re really too pathetic 
to be true.” 



“I’ve been around, Alek. And 
wherever I’ve been I’ve looked in 
depth as well as at the surface. It’s 
not a perspective you’d understand, 
but it means I can back my 
judgment against yours with a 
reasonable chance of being right.” 
Ren turned on his heel and 
stalked out of the room. It was ob- 
vious that his attempt to persuade 
Hardun to go voluntarily had met 
with no sort of success. Ren’s 
knowledge of spaceport security 
measures — and of the detection and 
defense capabilities of a docked 
battle cruiser — did not incline him 
to place much faith in the idea that 
the Imaiz would have a greater suc- 
cess by his own methods. They 
would probably have to wait until 
the pressure on Ranee brought 
about an official recall. Ren shud- 
dered. In the meantime Hardun 
could act without restriction — and 
if he accepted that his period of op- 
portunity was limited, the next 
twenty-four hours could be a very 
crucial time in Anharitte’s history. 

I T MIGHT have been his 
imagination affecting his in- 
terpretation of the scene or it might 
have been some social reflection of 
the societies’ decision, but Ren had 
the distinct impression of unease in 
the city as he returned. Theinarkets 
were quiet, almost deserted. The 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



149 




streets were far less crowded than 
usual and his own office was 
deserted and dead. His bond- 
servants had been withdrawn by 
the Pointed Tails — whose legal 
property they were — and the nor- 
mally busy household was at a 
standstill. Ren was even forced into 
the extreme of doing his own shop- 
ping when he wished to eat — and 
the preparation of his solitary meal 
was a process which caused him to 
think seriously about his next 
move. 

He could not back down on his 
stand against Hardun, nor could he 
reasonably do more than he had 
done to secure the latter’s de- 
parture. There appeared to be no 
basis for any sort of pact with the 
Imaiz that would not be com- 
promising later — and in any case, 
Ren felt that he had nothing of 
interest to offer. The best mode of 
release from the impasse would un- 
doubtedly be the swift intervention 
by the Freetrade Council acting on 
Ranee. Ren could only hope that 
the council would successfully act 
before Di Irons began to examine 
too closely the reasons behind the 
Pointed Tails’ decision to withdraw 
their services. If the prefect were to 
learn the truth about the rocket 
launcher on the plains he would 
have no option but to start a chain 
of protests that must involve the 
planetary government and ulti- 



mately the Galactic Federation it- 
self. 

Di Irons, then was the main 
problem for the moment. Idly Ren 
speculated on the strategy for a suc- 
cessful pattern of bluff if the 
prefect’s sure nose for trouble 
should lead him loo close to the 
truth. The answers were not en- 
couraging. He therefore decided 
that this would be a prudent time to 
visit some of the more distant of the 
company’s trading installations. By 
this ruse he could probably delay a 
confrontation until the removal of 
Alek Hardun was a accomplished 
fact. Accordingly he packed in 
preparation for an early start and 
retired exhausted to his bed. 

4 

AN EXPLOSION— or rather a 
series of explosions — broke 
him savagely out of his sleep. He 
awoke in alarm as multiple flashes 
of light glared in window-patterned 
squares of whiteness from the walls 
of his room. The thunder followed 
swiftly. Ren leaned back, prepared 
to listen to the storm — until it 
slowly filtered into his con- 
sciousness that there was no such 
thing as a storm on Roget. 

In an instant of panic he flung 
himself from his bed and put his 
head out of the window. The night 
sky was ringing as yet another great 
explosion from the direction of the 
plains shredded the unwilling air. 



150 



IF 




Without pausing to dress Ren ran 
downstairs to the microwave com- 
municator. As he turned on the 
stair the largest explosion yet made 
the building vibrate. Only the 
distance in the quality of the sound 
made him certain that the explosion 
was at the spaceport. The nature 
and effect of so violent a blast at 
that point of origin was something 
he scarcely dared to consider. 

Although he called both on the 
service and emergency frequencies, 
he could obtain no reply from the 
spaceport control. This silence was 
unprecedented and suggested a 
state of crisis so acute that even the 
information backup for the Di- 
saster Center was unobtainable. 
This convincingly fitted the scale of 
the catastrophe he had deduced 
from the intensity of the shock- 
waves. It was credible that as much 
as a quarter of the spaceport in- 
stallation had been destroyed. On 
an undeveloped world like Roget, 
where civil emergency services were 
virtually nonexistent, the entire 
work of disaster containment and 
rescue work would have to be han- 
dled by the spaceport’s own person- 
nel. 

Ren dressed hurriedly. He did not 
even need light in his rooms. The 
sky, made bright by the angry 
redness of a major spaceport fire, 
provided more than adequate 
illumination. Knowing that his 



training would enable him to do lit- 
tle in the way of offering practical 
assistance, his intention on reaching 
the street door had been merely to 
walk to the limits of Firsthill in 
order to gain a better view. As he 
descended the steps, however, two 
armed watchmen flung themselves 
hurriedly across his path. 

“Agent Ren, you’re not permit- 
ted to leave.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Prefect Di Irons’ orders. You’re 
to be confined to your chambers 
until he’s free to deal with you.” 
“But why the hell? This is no 
doing of mine.” 

“That you must discuss with him. 
But you’d better be convincing. 
Nights such as this were never 
known in Anharitte before you 
made trouble with the Imaiz, ” 

Ren allowed himself to be es- 
corted back into the chambers, 
where the watchmen maintained an 
uncommunicative guard. When the 
light of the morning was well ad- 
vanced he heard other noises in the 
house and soon guessed that his 
bondservants had been returned 
and were picking up their duties as 
though no interruption of service 
had occurred. Shortly his breakfast 
tray was placed before him. His 
guards were completely ignored. 

By such signs he knew that Alek 
Hardun had been wrong in his 
certainty that no force on Roget 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



151 




was capable of dealing with an 
armed space cruiser at dock. It was 
a fair bet that about a third of the 
spaceport installation had gone 
with it. By some ingenious piece of 
wizardry a way had been found 
through all the alarms and defenses 
and the Imaiz had made good his 
promise. 

^ HOUR after mid-day the 
unusual echo of horses hoofs 
clattered to the door of his 
chambers. The sound was rare be- 
cause the great horses of Roget, 
fully as large as the ancient Terran 
dray-horses, were unpopular beasts 
on the crowded roads of the city. 
They had their place at the great 
provincial estates, but for town 
work they were used mainly by the 
civil powers as a symbol of au- 
thority. A message from Di Irons 
required Ren to join the cavalcade 
to the spaceport. The reins of the 
great saddled and bridled beast 
were flung toward him with the 
instruction that he was to mount. 

Ren's riding experience was little 
and the size of his steed was 
daunting. He said as much, but his 
protests were dismissed. 

“Then here’s your chance to 
learn. Agent. The prefect won’t 
wait.” 

Somehow he managed to mount. 
He sat unhappily astride the great 
beast whose back seemed as broad 



and as warm as the bed Ren had 
vacated during the night. Having 
mastered the art of staying on top 
of the moving animal, he next faced 
the problem of control. He found 
himself assisted by the fact that the 
giant horse appeared to know 
exactly what was required of it in 
terms of destination and speed. It 
obediently followed the messenger 
and two others through the streets 
of Firsthill, out on to the Trade 
Road, down the slopes and on to 
the Via Arena. 

The messenger rode hard, 
without pausing for further expla- 
nation. The fact that his escort rode 
mainly ahead of him led Ren to sus- 
pect that his presence was required 
for a constructive purpose, rather 
than a punitive one. They soon 
came in sight of the spaceport, from 
which, even in daylight, the bright 
flames from burning fuel tanks 
showed crimson under the vast 
columns of smoke. 

Ren’s initial surprise at being 
conveyed in so unusual a manner 
was soon dispelled as he realized 
that carriage by the giant horses 
were certainly the fastest means 
of transport available. Although 
cushion-craft were able to produce 
a better turn of speed on the open 
stretch of the Via Arena, the slower 
working of the craft in the city gave 
ample advantage to horses. His 
present journey was accomplished 



152 



IF 




in well under half an hour. Bruised 
and sore, Ren clung frantically to 
the saddle horns of the mammoth 
animal and only fell when he at- 
tempted to dismount. 

XV 

D I IRONS, looking fiercer and 
sterner than ever, waited for 
Ren to pick himself out of the dust, 
then strode away, indicating that 
the agent should follow. Ren 
followed painfully, wondering if his 
encounter with the horse had done 
something irrevocable to his legs. 
Their path took them broadly 
across the spaceport, most of which 
was obscured by wide trails of 
drifting smoke. The prefect stopped 
when finally they neared the 
number-five landing bowl where the 
Ranee battle cruiser had been. 

Ren caught his breath as the scale 
of the catastrophe became ap- 
parent. The tall ship had been 
totally demolished and the parts 
further shattered. Even the single 
components seemed destroyed. 
Only a very small part of the ship’s 
total mass was still evident. The 
rest of it had presumably been va- 
porized or dispersed over many 
thousands of meters of terrain. 
Even the nearly indestructible wolf- 
ramie of the landing bowl was 
heavily cratered as though from a 
major war. The picture was one. of 



violence multipled by violence. It 
was a job most thoroughly done. 

“How did it happen?” asked Ren. 

Di Irons put on a thunderous 
scowl. “Pictor Don has a theory 
that the ship was toppled by an 
s.h.e. charge placed in the vicinity 
of one of the ship’s stabilizers. Her 
engines then exploded and that 
touched off her magazine. Unfortu- 
nately she was heavily overarmed 
and some of the later explosions 
took away a fair proportion of the 
spaceport buildings. I’ve no doubt 
we’ll be receiving a detailed account 
of the damage from the spaceport 
Disaster Control center in due 
course. That’s why I wanted you 
here. You’re going to give me an in- 
dependent view of how it was done, 
who did it — and why it was 
necessary.” 

“Me? But I know nothing about 
it. I was asleep at the time.” 

“That’s no excuse,” said Di 
Irons. “I’ll wager you know a great 
deal about it. Pretense will save you 
nothing. Let’s be in no doubt as to 
where you stand. In the past 
twenty-five hours I’ve uncovered 
sufficient facts about you and the 
activities with which you’ve been in- 
volved to have you declared per- 
sona non grata on just about every 
civilized planet in the universe. Not 
only that, but for default of various 
laws on Roget under Space Con- 
ventions I could encourage our 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



153 




government to make claim for 
damages that would not only 
bankrupt your company but would 
cripple another half-dozen of their 
Freetrade associates. 

“Having warned you to follow 
the advice of your society on how to 
conduct a feud with the Imaiz, you 
have no conceivable defense for you 
actions. So do you now volunteer to 
answer my questions or do I have to 
break both you and the company?” 
“What exactly do you want to 
know?” asked Ren unhappily. 

“This battle cruiser — it must 
have carried enough armaments to 
start a major war. Was it put here 
by the Freetrade Council?” 

“No. It was donated by Ranee, 
ostensibly as a technical backup 
facility. K don’t think the majority 
of the council was aware that it was 
anything else.” 

“So why did it possess a fully 
equipped war potential?” 

“It was one of Ranee’s so-called 
‘disaster ships’ — though I’ve come 
to suspect that their function is to 
cause disasters not to alleviate 
them.” 

“Didn’t you know of this when 
you asked for it?” 

“I didn’t ask for it. It just ar- 
rived. When I found out what sort 
of equipment it carried I com- 
plained to Director Vestevaal. He 
went immediately to Freetrade 
Central to demand its withdrawal.” 



“Hmm!” Di Irons nodded 
thoughfully. “And I take it that 
somebody couldn’t wait to see it go 
peacefully. Your friend the Imaiz, 
perhaps?” 

“I’ve no evidence,” said ^Ren. 
“But he knew it for what it was and 
its demolition has a characteristic 
thoroughness.” 

“That’s agreed,” said Di Irons, 
looking around at the widespread 
damage. “And in the circumstances 
I don’t think we shall hear much 
from Ranee about her loss, espe- 
cially if Director Vestevaal’s al- 
ready protesting about it at 
Freetrade Central. But more than 
the ship went here. A lot of highly 
valuable ^spaceport installation 
went with it. When the Galactic 
Spaceports commission learns of it 
the repercussions are going to be 
grave. I’m going to be under 
pressure to produce sopie good 
answers. Frankly, I don’t have the 
expertise in outworld technology to 
produce those answers. But you do. 
And you’ve the additional advan- 
tage of knowing both the Imaiz and 
the pattern of life in Anharitte, 
neither of which an outworld inves- 
tigator would know. Therefore I’m 
willing to strike a bargain with 
you.” 

“What sort of bargain?” 

“We both suspect it was the 
Imaiz who destroyed this ship. I 
want to know how much evidence 



154 



IF 




against the Imaiz could be gathered 
by an outworld enquiry into the 
disaster.” 

“You choose your words most 
carefully. Prefect.” 

“In this instance I’ve a good 
reason ^o do so.” 

^‘And what have I to gain froni 
the exercise?” 

“Give me some good answers, 
Ren, and I might forget to file any 
charges against yourself or the 
company.” 

“I’ll willingly try, though your 
terms don’t give me much option. 
But I’ll need information. How 
cooperative can I expect to find the 
spaceport staff?” 

“They themselves are in default 
for permitting an armed warcraft to 
remain docked at their facility be- 
yond the recognized refueling time. 
Therefore their careers are equally 
in my hands. I suspect you’ll find 
them very cooperative indeed.” 

P ^ICTOR DON, the spaceport’s 
emergency commander spread 
his hands resignedly. 

“I can assure you, Tito, that out- 
side sqbotoge is quite out of the 
question. Nobody could have got 
through without detection. Because 
of the permanent danger to person- 
nel around the landing bowls the 
whole area is monitored by radar. 
The radar overscan extends well be- 
yond the space^rt perimeter. The 



computer constantly oversees all 
activity in the area and throws up 
alarm signals for any potentially 
dangerous or unusual event.” 

“What other defenses have you?” 
“Mainly the fences. The first and 
second fences form a corridor 
manned by a patrol with guard 
dogs. Then there’s an electified 
fence inside that and the inner one’s 
a barbed barrier. It would take a 
very clever person indeed to get 
through that lot.” 

“We happen to suspect a very 
clever person. What I’m trying to 
establish is — did he indeed get 
through or was the blast an acci- 
dent? What about the gates?” 

“Only two — both remotely con- 
trolled and responding only to the 
controllers direct orders. He has to 
satisfy himself by computer verifi- 
cation of ident cards and the vision 
link that the person asking for ad- 
mission has the necessary authority 
to enter.” 

“And did he give clearance to 
anyone at a time reasonably close 
to the blowup?” 

i“No.There were no admissions 
for at least four hours before the 
blowup occured.” 

“Then it would have to be 
through the fence. Has the whole 
perimeter been checked?” 
“Electrical checks have been car- 
ried out. Nothing was found. 
Physical examination of all the wire 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



155 




on the perimeter will take a little 
time.” 

“Then let me have the answers as 
soon as you can,” said Ren. “If 
somebody penetrated that fence I 
want to know how. Did your radar 
scan tell you nothing?” 

“The watch computer signaled 
nothing unusual.” 

“How critical is the watch com- 
puter?” 

“Sufficient for normal pur- 
poses.” 

“But does it discriminate 
between different types of radar 
returns?” 

“Necessarily so. Frequently ani- 
mals from the plains stray near to 
the outer fence and trigger a minor 
alert. Also some birds and small 
animals actually live out on the 
bowls. The computer has been pro- 
gramed to reject the movement of 
small creatures and to respond 
mainly to the approach of some- 
thing the size of a cushion-craft or 
one of the tracked tenders.” 

“Then how does it function for 
personnel protection on the bowls?” 
“It’s spectrum filtered to give 
maximum response to metallic ob- 
jects while remaining relatively 
insensitive to organics and 
nonmetals. Any crews working on 
the bowls will naturally be wearing 
thermo-reflective suits and these 
give a very good radar return.” 

“So it is possible for an unsuited 



man to have walked across the 
bowls without the computer’s 
classifying him as an object to be 
reported?” 

“It’s possible, but I see the point 
as rather academic. Nobody could 
damage a battle cruiser with less 
than about a hundred kilos of s.h.e. 
explosive. I’d seriously doubt that 
somebody broke the fence and car- 
ried that weight across the bowls on 
foot. Perhaps a trained man might 
do it — but I don’t believe it hap- 
pened. I think they’d have had to 
use a vehicle — and if they’d done so 
the computer would have spotted it 
and sounded the alarm.” 

“Nevertheless,” said Ren, “I’d 
like to know if there was anything 
on the radar scan below the com- 
puter’s indicating threshold. Do 
you tape a record?” 

“Of course.” Pictor Don shrug- 
ged his shoulders. “I’ll have a re- 
play set up in the operations room. 
If you want my opinion — it’s a 
waste of time.” 

“What are you looking for, 
Ren?” The stern and thoughtful 
prefect was shadowing Ren closely, 
listening to every syllable of his 
investigation. “I’d have thought 
Don’s evidence that there was no 
penetration of the fence was pretty 
conclusive.” 

“Not conclusive enough. If it did 
happen we need to know now, not 
have it thrown up during some out- 



156 



IF 




world inquiry. All defenders and all 
defense systpms have blind spots. If 
someone has the wit and the ability 
to figure just where these blind 
spots are they form a positive ad- 
vantage to the attacker. A bit of in- 
genuity coupled with the right 
know-how should produce a 
method of attack the defenders 
won’t expect because they know it 
to be impossible. Our prime suspect 
in this case is a recognized master 
of impossible events and is also a 
considerable technician. 1 can’t see 
that dogs, a few wire fences and a 
radar scan need be any deterrent to 
the Imaiz/* 

‘‘There’s been some talk of rock- 
ets,” said Di Irons. “Couldn’t Dion 
have used one without having to 
penetrate the fence?” 

“He may well have the capability 
at Magda, but that wasn’t the way 
it was done. A« I see the evidence, 
the ship was toppled, as you’ve al- 
ready said, by an s.h.e. charge 
placed under a stabilizer. But that 
couldn’t in itself have initiated the 
entire chain of disasters that 
followed. Almost certainlv the ship 
was toppled upon a further line of 
explosive charges, and the direction 
of the ship’s fall was calculated to 
insure that those charges would do 
the maximum damage. It was an 
exercise in fine mathematics, un- 
dertaken by someone who had a 
very clear idea of the working 

THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



layout of such a battle cruiser.” 
“From which you conclude?” 
“That the operation was carried 
out by a competent out- 
worlder — someone familiar with 
space constructions. And it would 
have taken time and careful 
measurement to place those 
charges accurately. Whoever did it 
must have worked on the bowl 
under cover of darkness and had a 
pretty shrewd idea that he would 
not be picked up by the radar 
monitor. That’s an assembly of 
knowledge and skills very difficult 
to match. I think that Dion must be 
a well-trained saboteur — in ad- 
dition to his other talents.” 

D I IRONS was not yet con- 
vinced. 

“If I understand Pictor Don cor- 
rectly it would have taken at least a 
hundred kilos of explosive just to 
topple the ship. If you’re now 
saying that further charges were 
laid — they must add up to a 
considerable extra weight of explo- 
sive. All this had to be moved 
through the fence and brought 
across at least half a kilometer of 
landing bowls — without detection.” 
“I know very little about explo- 
sives,” said Ren. “But I’d doubt 
that less than two hundred kilos of 
s.h.e. would have done the trick.” 
“And brought in without using a 
vehicle? Do you suppose they used 

157 




mules or magic?” The prefect was 
sarcastic. 

“I don’t know how it was done, 
but I’m willing to bet we’ll find a 
few answers on the below-threshold 
level of the radar records.” 

The radar overscan, untrimmed 
by the computer, reflected 
considerable movement of wildlife 
outside the perimeter fence. The 
false alarms would have been con- 
tinual had not spectrum filtering 
been employed. In contrast, the ca- 
sual movements of spaceport 
personnel and vehicles were easily 
distinguishable by the heightened 
radar responses to the various me- 
tallic substances they carried. It 
was at about this level of discrimi- 
nation that the computer operated. 

Pictor Don replayed the scan at 
its original speed for the two hours 
prior to the blowup. He and Ren 
concentrated fully on the unedited 
replay screen, while Di Irons fretted 
in the background, unable to 
comprehend the screen’s symbol- 
ism. All of the first hour of the re- 
play and half of the second passed 
without producing any information 
of obvious interest. Suddenly Ren 
gave a cry. 

""Southeast corner — behind the 
shadow of the freighter on pad 
eight — something is moving on the 
bowls.” 

There was no doubt of the fact. 
Emerging from the radar shadow of 



the freighter, already well within 
the wire, two images sped across 
the bowls toward the doomed ship. 
The radar responses were weak, 
well below the computer’s preset 
threshold. The moving forms gave 
no clue as to their form or com- 
position. Pictor Don ran marker 
blips across the screen to measure 
the velocity of the moving points. 
He frowned at the resulting calcu- 
lation. 

“Slightly up on fifteen kilometers 
an hour,” he said in puzzlement. 
“Men running perhaps, but cer- 
tainly not men carrying two 
hundred kilos of deadweight.” 

‘"Perhaps horses?” asked Di 
Irons. 

Don shook his head. ‘"Not 
enough mass for horses.” 

“Is there much metal present?” 
asked Ren. 

“Some, but its not very distinct. 
More like a grid than a solid. Cer- 
tainly not enough mass to be a ve- 
hicle. The computer wouldn’t be 
able to distinguish between it and 
the oxide glaze on the bowls 
themselves.” 

“Then what the devil can have 
carried them across the field at a 
speed like that?” 

“Did you ever think of 
wizardry?” Di Irons had the 
faintest smile of mischief around 
his grizzled mouth. 

“I don’t care for wizardry,” said 



158 



IF 




Ren. “There’s a physical expla- 
nation for all this. Dion-daizan’s no 
more of a wizard than I am.” 

In less than three minutes the two 
dots had moved from the perimeter 
across the intervening half ki- 
lometer to the foot of the 
threatened Ranee ship. Their 
passage must have been effectively 
silent — they appeared to make no 
effort to avoid the lock-watch who 
would have been aroused by the 
sound of an approaching vehicle. 

“Were they invisible also?” asked 
Di Irons. 

When the dots stopped under the 
radar shadow of the ship the screen 
picture became confused by the 
sheer mass against which the 
returns were being measured. In 
less than a minute, however, the 
dots separated themselves and 
streaked back toward the perimeter 
fence, moving even faster than be- 
fore. Soon they were lost behind the 
shadow of the freighter on pad eight 
and the scene closed down to an ap- 
parent stillness as the time ap- 
proached the moment of blowup. 

“Well, we still don’t know what 
got in, but at least we know where.” 
said Ren. “Let’s go and take a 
closer look.” 

a I THE southeast perimeter, 
where the bulk of the freighter 
on pad eight stood squarely 
between them and the damaged 

THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



radar tower, Ren examined the 
wire. There was little wonder the 
break had not been detected before. 
Had he not had a suspicion of what 
to look for, he would not have 
found it for himself. The wires had 
been cut to a level sufficient to 
admit something not much larger 
than a man. Every single strand had 
subsequently been neatly butt- 
welded to form a virtually invisible 
repair. Any competent technician 
could have done it — given the right 
equipment and the necessary time. 

“But we had guard-dog patrols 
between the outer fences,” objected 
Pictor Don, when the fact was 
pointed out. 

“Who mans the patrols?” asked 
Ren. 

“One of the socal societies — very 
reliable.” 

“Perhaps! But for most of the 
night there was a withdrawal of so- 
ciety services from all matter af- 
fecting outworlders. In effect, there 
was a period when the Imaiz could 
move unopposed on whatever 
course he chose. He might even 
have been able to enlist society aid. 
I’m reasonably certain that if he 
chose to cut these wires last night 
the dogs would have been con- 
ventiently elsewhere.” 

“But why should the Societies 
cooperate with him in this way.” 
Pictor Don was perplexed. 

“Because,” said Ren, “Dion’s 

159 




probably the only force standing 
between Roget as it is — and 
eventual domination by Ranee. I 
know this. The societies know it 
and I suspect my Lord Di Irons 
knows it also. I may be an out- 
worlder, but I’ve heard enough 
about Ranee’s mailed fist in the 
universe to know that, given a free 
choice, 1 would have been out there 
last night holding that wire open for 
Dion to enter.” 

Ren turned away from the wire 
and wandered into the scrub edging 
the surrounding plain. Shortly he 
came back and addressed Di Irons. 

“Well, Prefect, I’m ready to 
answer your questions.” 

Di Irons compressed his mouth 
under his beard. The eyes that met 
Ren’s were full of comprehension, 
edged with a slight smile. 

“ What about that radar record?” 
asked the Prefect. 

“What radar record? It must 
have been destroyed in the 
blowup.” 

“And the wire?” 

“Could never have been 
disturbed. Technology on Roget 
obviously isn’t far enough advanced 
to permit a gas-shielded electric 
butt-weld to be made.” 

“And the blowup?” 

“Who knows,” said Ren. “Acci- 
dents can always happen on an 
overarmed man-of-war. I think the 
point should be made most strongly 



to the Spaceports Commission. 
They must be encouraged to take 
far greater care of ships when 
operating on foreign soil. Otherwise 
it might prove inconvenient to have 
a spaceport so near Anharitte.” 
“And we can positively rule out 
outside intervention?” 

“I can think of no way in which a 
man or perhaps two men with 
neither beast nor vehicle could 
travel half a kilometer in three 
minutes with at least two hundred 
kilos of dead weight. Such an idea 
smacks of wizardry.” 

“Which we all know doesn’t 
exist,” said Di Irons. “You know, 
Tito, I’ve a feeling I’ve misjudged 
you. You’ve a depth of perception I 
would not have associated with 
your mercenary profession. My 
report will follow the lines of your 
summary — ^^and you and Pictor Don 
can sign a testimony to its ac- 
curacy. You’ve proven to me that 
there could have been no outside in- 
tervention. But strictly off the 
record — and since you don’t admit 
Dion’s a wizard— how do you 
imagine the thing could have been 
done?” 

Ren nodded and turned out to- 
wards the brush. 

“Come over here. Do you see 
those marks in the dust? What do 
you suppose made those?” 

“That’s very strange. 1 don’t 
think I’ve seen the like of them be-

fore. Do you suppose snakes — ” 

“I imagine they’re snake tracks,” 
said Ren, tongue in cheek. '^But 
they bear a strong resemblance to 
the tracks of a device I once saw 
used on Terra.” 

Di Irons straightened as a society 
runner approached. The man had 
come around the perimeter from 
the gate to hand him a message 
form. The fellow’s exertions un- 
derscored the urgency with which 
he had been dispatched. The 
prefect scanned the paper anxiously 
and handed it to Pictor Don. Both 
men seemed tremendously upset. 

“Trouble?” asked Ren. 

The form was passed to him. 
With mounting disbelief he read the 
message.

the top — at Galactic Federation

“That may not be easy,” said 
Pictor Don unhappily. “Our FTL 
link to anywhere is routed through 
the relay terminal on Ranee.” 
“Damn!” Ren looked across the 
blasted spaceport where even now 
the smoke trails persisted over the 
scene of devastation. The enormity 
of Ranee’s fabrication made his 
head spin, but his heart was seized 
with the cold clamp of fear. 

If Alek Hardun’s murder wagon 
had been regarded as a good will 
vessel Ren hated to think what 
thirty openly operating disaster 
ships would bring. Despite his in- 
creasing respect for the resourceful 
Dion-daizan he knew that salvation 
this time depended on the rapid ac- 
quisition of an armed spacefleet. 
Presumably not even the wizard of 
Anharitte could produce that. Or 
could he? At the moment Ren knew 
only from the trackmarks in the 
dust that the Imaiz^ possessed at 
least two bicycles.

THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE

W HEN a science-fiction writer 
runs into the general type of 
reader the first cliche put to him 
usually is: “Where do you get your 
crazy ideas?” This question seems 
to reflect a recognition of the im- 
portance of ideas in the field. The 
answer I find most satisfactory, in- 
cidentally, is that I steal them — 
which is at least partially true, since 
we all depend oh each other to stir 
up our own thinking. ^ 

It’s difficult to say which element 
has the greater importance in a 
story — the idea or its execution. 
Neither can stand wholly by itself. 
Some of the early science fiction 
consisted of almost pure idea and 
featured little in the way of 
execution. Today many of the 
books I read seem high on 
execution and low in ideas. Cer- 
tainly few demonstrate more than a 



variation of a common idea. 

But good books can be written 
with an unprecedentedly smooth 
execution of an old idea. An 
outstanding book must, however, 
provide at least a fresh treatment of 
a good idea and show good 
execution. Examples of such rare, 
great books are Ursula Le Guin’s 
Left Hand of Darkness and Stur- 
geon’s More Than Human, 

I’ve just had the chance to see 
what happens to one of my ideas 
when it has been executed by three 
other writers. The occasion is The 
Day The Sun Stood Still, edited by 
Robert Silverberg (Thomas 
Nelson, $5.95; also available 
shortly from the Science Fiction 
Book Club for $ 1 .49). 

Silverberg asked me to do a two- 
page idea around which other 
writers could develop long novel- 



162 




ettes. I decided to suggest that a 
future religious leader might per- 
suade most of the world to pray 
together for a sign. The sign was 
vouchsafed: for a night and day 
(less 1x12“^ sidereal day) the Earth 
moved not around the sun, neither 
did it rotate — no other changes 
allowed. The question then was: 
What kind of world might come 
about if faith were replaced by 
certain knowledge? 

Poul Anderson, Gordon R. 
Dickson and Robert Silverberg 
were the writers assigned to handle 
the question. I was curious as to 
what such top authors had done 
with it and began reading eagerly. 

Strangely, it seemed to me at first 
they did very little with the 
question. They seized as their 
themes the Joshuan miracle itself 
rather than the eventual world that 
might have resulted from it. And 
nobody made any use of the plant 
that God (or Whoever) seemed to 
leave a clue of duodecimal nature. 

Anderson’s A Chapter of Reve- 
lation deals with a scientist and an 
ordinary little man who becomes 
the leader to start people praying 
together. He postulates a back- 
ground of approaching nuclear war. 
The miracle of the sign halts this — 
but the aftermath for the two 
characters is grim and confusing. 
To Anderson, apparently, the result 
of a Joshuan miracle is the collapse 



of all values. In his post-miracle 
world neither science nor religion 
seems to be viable. 

Silverberg is equally concerned 
with collapsing values. In his 
Thomas the Proclaimer he deals 
with the results for the prophet, the 
man who called for the sign and 
was. answered. Thomas was a dis- 
reputable revivalist, egged on by 
Kraft, his press agent and daemon. 
While the world about reacts to the 
shock, Thomas has to turn inward 
to see himself. And when he does he 
finds that Kraft is still with him. 
This is a bitter epic of a soul that 
can not accept knowledge any more 
than it earlier could wholly accept 
faith. 

My own personal favorite is 
Dickson’s Things Which Are 
Caesars. In some ways Dickson 
threw away more of the original 
sketch than did either of the others. 
But in one essential I feel he looked 
deeper into it. He apparently de- 
cided that, given both Joshua and 
the current leader, the phenomena 
described were periodic — the sign 
was not merely given once, but 
regularly. He chose to have the 
miracle before the current one ap- 
pear about a thousand years ago. 
Then he picked a man who had 
survived that previous miracle as 
his major character. 

Here the miracle is produced by a 
leader we do not meet. This doesn’t

matter. What matters is the second 
chance given to his Ranald, the an- 
cient Viking who has been a later 
Wandering Jew, in effect. Is this to 
be his redemption? Well, that seems 
to depend. 

Dickson sets it all up in a sort of 
Woodstock, where people have 
come to wait for the sign instead of 
to listen to rock groups. His cast of 
characters is rich and well in- 
tegrated — the whole world is re- 
solved in a half-dozen characters 
who assemble around Ranald’s 
campfire. All at first seem more 
interesting than the rather detached 
Ranald — yet Dickson’s execution is 
done surely and well, to leave us 
with Ranald as our Everyman. 

1 don’t think it’s a great book — in 
fact, I don’t think any book by 
three writers against a similar back- 
ground can be great. For three men, 
working with an idea which did not 
germinate for years in their own 
minds, to produce three great 
stories would be asking for another 
sort of miracle. But I enjoyed the 
bool^ immensely. 

U NHAPPILY I’m much less 
impressed with Gordon R. 
Dickson’s execution of his own 
ideas in The Pritcher Mass (Dou- 
bleday, $4.95). This one deals with 
various aspects of psi powers. I 
don’t believe in such powers, but 1 
see no reason why they can’t be the 



basis of excellent fiction. However, 
there does seem a tendency to let 
the normal rules of tight plotting 
loosen with such a theme and I’m 
afraid Dickson’s story shows that 
tendency. 

His basic idea is strong. Earth 
has become so polluted that men 
cannot survive outside its enclosed 
cities. Any man left outside is soon 
destroyed by a fungus growth in his 
lungs. No remedy has been found 
for the disease. Sooner or later even 
the cities will be nonviable. Man’s 
only hope is to get to the stars. He 
has no physical means to do so, but 
has developed something called the 
Pritcher Mass — that is, a projected 
gathering of psychic energy that 
supposedly will be able to locate 
and settle other worlds for man- 
kind. The few people on Earth with 
provable psychic talents are sent to 
work on the Pritcher Mass. 

Sant is a reject from this pro- 
gram. But after an accident forces 
him to move through the dreaded 
outside world he finds his survival 
possible only by a desperate use of 
paranormal power. He believes the 
experience has strengthened his 
psyche enough to enable him to 
pass the test and be accepted. But 
by now he has become enmeshed in 
a dark plot between a Witchcraft of 
underground psychics and a crime 
syndicate that is trying to take over 
the Pritcher Mass. 



164 



IF 




So far so good. But from here on 
things gradually go haywire. Sant 
does get to the Mass, but finds 
reason to doubt it can do what it is 
designed for. Nonetheless he finds 
ways to use it to escape back to the 
outlands of Earth. 

The narration’s logic slips. Coin- 
cidence begins to enter rather 
strongly. The Pritcher Mass turns 
out to be perfect for solving prob- 
lems it was not meant to solve. 
Sant’s hopeless situation is eased by 
a discovery that the outlands are no 
problem to those with certain lucky 
psi abilities. (Must psi always 
degenerate from the specific to the 
general and become a damned 
universal panacea?) 

At the end everything is sewed 
up — the witches and the criminals 
make their moves in steady and 
predictable patterns. Routine 
action is stitched together — but at 
the end I at least felt that the thread 
had caught somewhere and the 
seams were all bunched together. 

The story begins marvelously, 
but ultimately my feeling was not a 
happy one. The execution was far 
below Dickson’s usual high level. 

U rsula K. LE GUIN’S han- 
dling of her Earthsea novels 
has been exemplary. The idea be- 
hind the series (now consisting of 
three novels) has proved so good 
that these books are among the 



happy list of those written for chil- 
dren that make even better reading 
for adults. The Farthest Shore 
Atheneum $6.25) brings to a con- 
clusion the saga of Ged, the great 
magician of Earthsea. 

In this one, a young man — 
Arren — comes to the island of the 
wise magicians to warn that magic 
is failing in many parts of the 
world. No one knows why, but the 
ancient spells no longer work and 
the magicians are losing the 
knowledge of the old speech that 
gave them power. Ged sets out with 
Arren and discovers that the 
menace is all too real and that its 
sphere of influence is rapidly 
growing. 

In a series of happy (for the 
reader) adventures, Ged begins to 
realize that a rash action of his own 
during his youth has loosed a 
malign influence on the world of 
Earthsea. And to conquer it his 
people must go to Selidor, the is- 
land where the oldest dragons 
dwell — and perhaps even beyond to 
a place from where men rarely 
return in their own living flesh. 

This is, of course, fantasy. But it 
is fantasy with a logic of execution 
that is usually found only in science 
fiction. Only the most hardened 
fantasy hater should be able to 
resist it. I highly recommend this 
novel, as I’ve recommended the two 
previous ones. The Farthest Shore

is rich in ideas, color and inven- 
tions — and excellently execute. 

D aw Books began with an 
idea, too — Donald A. Woll- 
heim felt that he could begin his 
own publishing company and Find 
at least four novels each month to 
publish. It was a rather large con- 
cept to come up with in a market al- 
ready well filled with other pub- 
lishers and established houses vying 
for writers. But judging by 
Wollheim’s latest batch of books in 
his first six months of operation the 
idea seems to be working. 

Of the last four books one is a re- 
print from hard covers — Dinosaur 
Beach, by Keith Laumer. (The 
price for this is 95^, as is true for all 
the DAW books so far). This is one 
of Laumer’s wealthiest novels as far 
as ideas are concerned. It involves 
the fairly ancient idea of a future 
that is tampering with time to 
change the viability of that future 
by changing the past. But nothing is 
ever simple when Laumer tackles 
time. Mixed with action during the 
Jurassic Age are hints of different 
futures with different goals and the 
control of some great robotic brain 
that controls all the multiple 
threads. It’s good, fast-paced ad- 
venture without obvious or banal 
themes. 

The second is The City Machine, 
by Louis Trimble. The idea here is 



basically a familiar one, but han- 
dled with some fresh insight. Men 
live in a great city, the overlords at 
the top, the technicians in the mid- 
dle and the workers on the unlovely 
bottom levels. The scene is not 
Earth — the city has been built on 
another planet. The first group to 
arrive built the level now used by 
workers. Next an invading group 
took over and built the upper levels. 
The interesting variant is that both 
groups used a machine that could 
be programed to build a whole city 
on order. This machine still exists 
on the somewhat inhospitable 
planet, but is kept secret by a few 
who have survived outside the city. 
They cannot use it, since they can- 
not read the original instructions. 
In fact, the city-dwelling technician 
hero is the only man who can still 
read the original language — and his 
knowledge is an imperfect remnant 
of childhood. The story involves the 
attempt of a group of rebels to use 
him to build a new city and free the 
workers. 

The book is free from most cli- 
ches and has some nice touches, tt 
makes for pleasant reading. 

The third DAW release is The 
Stardroppers, by John Brunner, an 
expanded and much improved 
version of an older story. Its idea is 
so well developed and has been 
given so much freshness that it isn’t 
fair to call it borrowed, though the 



166 



IF 




plot opens with a threat caused by 
communication with “other races” 
and becomes something else 
equally familiar. But the transition 
is cleverly done and the move from 
one to the other is surprising in con- 
cept, if not in its inevitable 
development. 

A security agent is sent to investi- 
gate a new invention, an apparently 
simple little gadget that produces 
sounds most listeners seem to 
understand — almost. It’s popu- 
larity had developed into a craze — 
and there are signs that many users 
are becoming psychotic and that 
the thing may be endangering world 
stability. These perils are con- 
firmed — even worse, it turns out 
that some people who have been 
“stardropping” suddenly disap- 
pear. Perhaps this snark is a 
boojum! 

The book is not one of Brunner’s 
stronger literary efforts — it’s one of 
the good adventure stories he 
turned out in considerable number 
before his work became more ambi- 
tious. But the ideas are sound and 
the execution is smooth and mas- 
terful. I found it a good novel to 
read for fun. 

The fourth novel of the current 
DAW books is a failure, but an 
interesting publishing coup, 
nevertheless. The Return of the 
Time Machine, by Egon Friedell, is 
intended as a sequel to the classic 



novel by H. G. Wells, done by a 
German writer and historian before 
World War II — as detailed in a 
foreword by Donald A. Wollheim. 

The story opens by presenting 
some (almost certainly suprious) 
correspondence of the journalist in 
the original novel with Wells 
through his secretary. Then it sets 
about continuing the adventures of 
the Time Traveler — this time as he 
sets out for the past. 

Friedell lets his story devolve into 
a bunch of incidents that seem more 
concerned with German mysticism 
of the type common in some circles 
in the ’thirties. There’s a touch of 
an improbable love story, a contact 
with the future (he never does really 
get faf into the past) in which two 
Egyptian priests discuss mind 
power — and a final episode in 
which all logic vanishes. 

Nobody seems to know whether 
Wells was aware of the original 
German publication of this book in 
1946. This is the first English 
version. I hope he did not know of 
the German edition — it would have 
been a shame for him to have been 
so insulted. 

Still, bad as it is, the book had to 
be published since it existed — and I 
can’t help admiring Wollheim’s 
ability to ferret it out. Though com- 
pletely lacking in ideas and badly 
executed, it has genuine value as a 
curiosity. •

Jim said, “to do with as you must. 
We give him to you because you are 
his god. He was ours.” 

Together they shoveled earth 
over the crude wooden casket and 
afterward Jenny placed a handful of 
spring flowers on the grave. Then 
she and Jim walked down the slope 
of the valley and across the fields to 
where the white prefabricated 
house stood, the aluminum work- 
shop just behind it. 

“Shall we watch a movie 
tonight?” Jenny asked. “Or do you 
think it would be disrespectful?” 

“I don’t think it would be disre- 
spectful,” Jim answered. “I don’t 
think Professor Tom would mind.” 
The movie they decided upon was 
Made for Each Other, starring 
Carole Lombard and James 
Stewart. They waited till after the 
sun went down. Then Jim put the 
film in the projector, turned out the 
lights. They sat down on the sofa to 
watch. They had watched the movie 
many times with Professor Tom 
and had hugged and kissed like the 
actors did, but never when he was 
looking. They had felt he might 
disapprove. But it was all right 



now, not because he was gone, but 
because they were man and wife. So 
they sat there on the sofa with their 
arms around each other, and every 
time Carole Lombard kissed James 
Stewart Jenny kissed Jim. And 
whenever James Stewart kissed 
Carole Lombard Jim kissed Jenny. 
Afterward they went outside to sit 
on the steps and scan the skies. But 
although they scanned them all 
night, they saw nothing but stars. 

At length morning arrived. 
Lovely Arcturus rose above the 
green lip of the valley and songbirds 
climbed air currents into the sky to 
drink the nectar of the new day. 

Jenny said to Jim, “Maybe we’re 
being in much too much of a 
hurry — maybe it takes time.” 

Jim answered, “Maybe it’ll come 
tonight.” 

J IM had been Professor Tom’s 
gardener and handyman, Jenny 
his cook and housekeeper. On 
Earth, before his retirement. 
Professor Tom had been an 
engineer in the mechanized-menial 
field and Jenny and Jim were al- 
most as beautiful as the stars in the 
old movies. He had loved them 
both, but it had been Jenny he had 
loved the most and sometimes tears 
he did not understand had come 
into his eyes when he looked at her. 

He had said on his deathbed, “I 
never figured on things coming to

this so soon. 1 preached humility all 
my life, but all the while I was just 
as arrogant as everybody else. I 
never thought that death would 
really step on my heels. But you 
two will be all right. The supply 
ship will be here within a year and 
I’ve left a note to the captain to 
take good care of you. He’s an old 
friend of mine.” 

“Will you marry us?” Jenny has 
asked and Professor Tom had 
looked at her and blinked. ) 

“You said,” Jim pointed out, 
“that once you were a justice of the 
peace. That gives you the authority 
to make us man and wife.” 

“That was long ago,” said 
Professor Tom, “but yes, I suppose 
it does. However — ” 

“Surely,” Jenny had interposed, 
“you wouldn’t want us to live in sin. 
We’re madly in love and there’s no 
telling how we’ll carry on without 
you here to chaperone us.” 

A tear zigzagged down Professor 
Tom’s sere cheek as he said, “Poor 
child, what do you know about 
making love — and what, good 
would the knowledge do you if you 
had it? But if it will make you 
happy — ” 

There was no bible in the house, 
but the professor had made do 
without it. He had spoken the beau- 
tiful words they had heard so often 
in the old moives. “In sickness and 
in health . Love, honor and 



obey ... I now pronounce you man 
and wife.” 

I IFE went on much as it had be- 
J fore. Jim worked in Professor 
Tom’s flower garden in daytime, 
keeping it free from weeds. There 
was a kitchen garden, too, and Jim 
cultivated it as faithfully as he had 
before, although it would serve no 
useful purpose now. He and Jenny 
had already thrown out the food, 
that was moldering in the re- 
frigerator. They had turned off the 
unit and put away the dishes. 

Every day Jenny cleaned the 
house from front to back, dusting 
furniture and scrubbing floors. Ex- 
cept for fixing meals for Professor 
Tom her routine was unchanged. 
Sometimes, while she was working, 
she would hum songs from the 
movie she and Jim had watched the 
night before. And sometimes in the 
middle of dusting the living room 
she would drop the cloth and dance 
the way Ruby Keeler did in 42nd 
Street, 42nd Street was her favorite 
movie, but My Blue Heaven was 
her favorite song. 

Sitting on the sofa in the light 
reflected from the screen, the auto- 
matic projector whirring behind 
them, they would embrace and kiss 
and Jim would say, “Did you have 
a good day, darling?” 

She would answer, “Yes, my 
sweet.” 



170 



IF 




He would kiss her eyes and ears 
and nose and she would kiss his 
chin. They would hold each other as 
tightly as they could, but nothing 
ever came of their ardor and the 
skies remained as empty as before. 

“Perhaps tomorrow,” Jenny 
would say. 

Jim would answer, “Yes, I’m 
sure tomorrow will be the Big 
Day.” 

But the Big Day failed to dawn 
and Happiness continued to hide in 
the hills, in the woodbine and the 
wildflowers — in the green bowers of 
the trees. 



F PROFESSOR TOM had stored 
both their memory banks with 
generous helpings of information, 
but for the most part these had to 
do with electronics, mechanical 
engineering, horticulture and 
cookery. It was to the old movies 
that they were indebted for their 
practical education. Most of the 
movies were products of the 1930’s, 
but there some from the ’twenties 
and a handful from the ’forties and' 
’fifties. The professor had spent a 
great many years and a great deal 
of money collecting them and 
naturally he had taken them with 
him when he had retired to 
Arcturus VI to live out his sunset 
years in solitude and peace in the 
isolated valley he had bought 



“ — ^light-years removed,” as he 
had put it, “from the malicious 
machinations of mankind.” 

Sitting With Jenny and Jim in the 
living room one night, watching 
The Bells of St. Marys, he had 
said, “That’s the way it was in those 
days — only that wasn’t, the way it 
really was at all.” 

“But how can something be true 
and yet not be true at all?'’ Jenny 
asked and he had laughed. 

“I can see, my dear, that despite 
the perfection of your computerized 
thought processes — or even more 
probably because of it — you’re in- 
capable of any non-Aristotelian 
thinking. Many things can be both 
true and untrue. The worlds we 
watch upon that magic screen, my 
dear, are distorted reflections of 
reality inhabited by the ghosts of 
people whose real selves were often 
hidden from their own eyes. A 
reality powdered and perfumed and 
with its vitals eviscerated — a reality 
tailored for people who hadn’t out- 
grown their need to be told fairy 
tales before they went to bed.” 
Professor Tom sighed. “But I’ll 
take it any day. For all its pious hy- 
pocrisies — for all its omissions and 
its untrue truths — it’s a thousand 
times better than the reality I lived 
in all my life and finally left behind. 
I guess when men grow old they 
like to hide in caves and watch 
reflections on the walls.” 



GHOSTS

In addition to the old movies, 
Professor Tom’s collection com- 
prised dozens of animated 
cartoons. Jenny and Jim found 
them fascinating. Some featured 
animals drawn to look like men or 
men drawn to look like animals. 
Others featured animals that were 
really meant to be animals but that 
talked and sometimes lived like 
human beings. In one way the 
cartoons were more educational 
than the movies, for they threw 
light on a certain mystery the 
movies were completely mum 
about. A mystery Professor Tom’s 
books — most of which were de- 
voted to electronics and mechanical 
engineering — did not even mention. 
In fact, if it hadn’t been for the 
cartoons Jenny and Jim would 
never have learned the Secret of 
Life. 

B ut apparently knowing the 
'Secret of Life was not enough. 
The valley exchanged its green 
dress for summer’s golden gown. 
The warm days and nights began 
parading past the prefabricated 
house. But although Jenny and Jim 
sat each evening on the sofa, aping 
the actions of the shadows on the 
screen, their embraces and kisses 
went unrewarded. The dawn of 
each new day found them sitting 
disappointed on their doorstep, as 
lonely as before. 



“Maybe it’s like that song that 
Don Ameche sings to Sonja 
Henie,” Jenny said. “You know the 
one I mean — that only one in a 
million is lucky in love. Or maybe 
what we’re trying to do is harder 
than we think.” 

“Maybe,” Jim answered. “And 
maybe it’s because they do things 
between scenes that we don’t know 
about.”^ 

“Do things such as what?” 

“Like maybe they take off their 
clothes and kiss and hug that way.” 
“Why would they take their 
clothes off? What difference would 
their being naked make?” 

“I don’t know,” said Jim, “but it 
wouldn’t hurt to try.” 

T hat evening before they sat 
down on the sofa they removed 
their clothes. Professor Tom had 
lost interest in sex even before he 
retired and Jenny’s body, although 
differently shaped, wasn’t a great 
deal different from Jim’s. The 
movie they watched abounded in 
love scenes, but although they em- 
braced and kissed every time the 
two main characters did, their ef- 
forts went as unrewarded as before. 

During one dawn, as they sat dis- 
consolately on their doorstep, Jim 
said, “I think I know the reason, 
Jenny — I think I know why for us it 
doesn’t work. We’re different — and 
this world is different, too. We’re 



172 



IF 




going to have to make it happen. 
We’ve got everything we need to 
work with, thanks to Professor 
Tom, and he taught us practically 
all he knew. Maybe he foresaw a 
time like this.” 

They got busy right away. Jim 
made the blueprint first, after 
consulting several of Professor 
Tom’s books. Then he made all the 
parts. Jenny helped him with the 
assembling. They worked day and 
night, taking time out only to watch 
the old movies and to kiss and em- 
brace like the stars. There was hope 
in them now and they put more and 
more passion into their kisses. 

“I want it to be a boy,” Jenny 
said. 

“Yes,” Jim answered. “I want a 
son.” 



They had begun work in midsum- 
mer. Fall was on hand when they 
finished, and yellow and crimson 
patterns had begun to show upon 
the hills. Jim had built a lightweight 
electric motor to provide the 
necessary power. He made two 
light but long-lasting batteries to 
feed it. Together he and Jenny 
climbed the valley slope. 

“We’ll give it all the height we 
can,” he said. “That way it’ll have a 
maximum chance of getting to 
wherever it has to go and of 
returning with its bundle.” 

He turned on the little motor and 
released the device into the air. 
Slowly it rose into the sky. It cir- 
cled the valley once, as he had pro- 
gramed it to do, then sped off 
toward the south.

Jenny said, '"But suppose the nur- 
sery doesn't lie in that direction.” 
"Then — after it comes back we’ll 
recharge its batteries and send it 
to the west. And after that, if 
necessary, to the east and to the 
north. The nursery has to be 
somewhere.” 

"Later on, if it’s successful, we’ll 
send it for others, won’t we?” Jenny 
said. 

"Of course. But first we’ll make 
love — otherwise it won’t work.” 
Hand in hand they walked down 
the slope and across the fields to the 
house. 

T he captain of the supply ship 
found them in the living room 
six months later. They were sitting 
on the sofa, their bodies covered 
with dust, their arms around each 
other*, their lips touching in a final 
kiss. Before them in the shadows an 
empty screen hung ghostlike on the 
wall. Behind them stood the au- 
tomatic projector they had used to 
project their dreams. The length of 
copper wire they had used to short 
themselves out was lying on the 
floor at their feet. 

The captain went all through the 
house. Professor Tom’s note was 
lying on the bedtable beside his 
empty bed. The captain read it. 
Then he returned to the living room 
and looked once more at the faces 
of Jenny and Jim. He had known 



Tom all his life and he had known 
Tom’s longdead wife. In Jenny’s 
face he saw young Tom’s beloved 
bride — in Jim’s, he saw young 
Tom. 

When he made them 77/ bet he 
didn't even know , . 

His first thought was to repair 
them, to bring them back to life. 
Then he found the mechanical stork 
lying in the back yard. One of its 
canvas wings was broken, its tiny 
motor was burned out and its power 
source had given up the ghost after 
its fourth and final flight. He 
guessed the truth. 

He had his men search the valley 
for Professor Tom’s grave. After 
they found it he had them carry 
Jenny and Jim up the slope and 
bury them beside it. It was only fit- 
ting that they should sleep beside 
their god. 

He spoke a few words to his own: 
"All of us leave ghosts behind of 
one kind or another. In a way, 
we’re ghosts ourselves. We haunt 
ourselves our whole lives through 
because no matter how hard we try 
we can never fulfill our dreams. 
We’re a lot like Jenny and Jim, 
which makes them human in a way. 
Grant them peace.” 

When spring came back again, 
the woodbine reached down from 
the hills and covered the two new 
graves and wildflowers appeared to 
welcome the springtime sun. #
