Otto McGavin suffered from 
a personellty problem— but 
If he solved it he would die! 



NOVELLA 



THE ONLY WAR 
WE’YE GOT 




JOE HALDEMAN 



I 

O tto mcgavin was a reasonably 
competent and extremely lucky 
“prime operator.” He wasn’t as 
deadly with a gun as James 
Borcroft had been or as handy with 
the blade as Petri Stalofam — he 
didn’t pick up a personality overlay 
as quickly as Bert Schauer and 
Susana Leeds could have learned 
four exotic languages in the time it 
took Otto to master Portuguese. 

But James and Petri and Bert 
and Susana had all died in the line 
of duty in the past year, three of 
them violently, while one chose the 



7 




pleasant lingering death of happy- 
plant overdose. Otto McGavin, we 
note, was lucky and was still alive. 

He looked barely alive, though, 
and about as luckless as possible, 
as an aide,helped him out of the 
TBII Personality Overlay section. 
He shuffled, stooped over, leaning 
on a weathered stick, the rustling of 
noisome rags an unpleasant coun- 
terpoint to his adenoidal panting. 
His nose looked — was — freshly 
broken and his face and arms were 
covered with running sores. The 
aide managed without touching 
him to guide him through a door 
marked: briefing and debrief- 
ing J. ELLIS, PH.D. 

Inside the office the aide parked 
him on a straight-backed chair fac- 
ing a nervous young man who sat in 
a government-gray chair behind a 
government-gray desk. The aide 
left quickly, as soon as he was sure 
that his charge wasn’t going to fall 
out of the chair. 

“C-cashew^” the young govern- 
ment man stuttered. “Battery. 
Rouge. P-pulpy.” 

A light glimmered behind the 
rheum in Otto’s eyes and he levered 
himself out of the chair, staggered 
and almost fell. “What — ’’ He 
touched his face, winced and stared 
at the sticky dampness on his 
fingers. He dropped back into the 
chair. 

“Now this time, this time it’s 
gone too far.’’ He plucked at the 
rags and a fragment came away be- 
tween his fingers. “Exactly who am 



I supposed to be this time — the An- 
cient Mariner? The Wandering 
Jew? Or just a garden-variety 
leper?’’ 

“Now, Colonel McGavin, I as- 
sure you, uh — ’’ 

“Assure me and be damned! 
This is three times in a row — three 
times I’ve been some weak old 
codger. Somebody in Planning 
must want me dead!” 

“No, not at all — that’s not it at 
all.” He shuffled some papers at his 
desk, not looking at Otto. “You 
have a good, uh, extremely good re- 
cord of success — under severe PO 
handicap, especially — ” 

“So think of how much better I 
could do if you clowns would let me 
be a normal human being for a 
change!” He grasped his ragged 
left arm, almost able to encircle 
bicep and triceps with one bony 
hand. “‘PO handicap.’ If you’d 
kept me under for another week 
you’d have handicapped me into 
the grave.” 

“You know it’s only, uh, tempo- 
rary — ” 

“Temporary! Young man — ” 

“Dr. Ellis,’’ the other said 
mildly. 

“Young Doctor — it might only 
take me a couple of weeks of 
starving in a null-g field to lose all 
this muscle, but I’ve got to get it 
back the old-fashioned way. Even 
with hypnosis — ” 

“No, Colonel, it is temporary — I 
mean — ” 

“What do you mean?”

“Well, you’re expected to — re- 
cover while on the assignment. 
Your persona is that of a, well, you 
might say a professional athlete.” 
“Yeah, the hundred-metercrutch 
relay, I can — ” 

“But no — no, you don’t see, he’s 
been — ” Ellis shuffled papers some 
more. “If we can get on with the 
briefing I’ll — ” 

“All right, all right. Nobody ever 
lets me bitch. What am I going to 
infiltrate — a hospital? A health 
spa?” 

“Oh, no. Neither. First a police 
station. The individual you’re im- 
personating is in jail, awaiting 
sent — ” 

“For dripping on somebody, no 
doubt.” 

“Uh — no. For murder. Premedi- 
tated first-degree murder. Assassi- 
nation, actually.” 

“Hey, that’s really fine. A new 
experience. Brain-wipe.” 

“Uh, well, you won’t be on 
Earth, you see — ” 

“I think I get the picture.” 

“On Selva they punish murder- 
ers either by burning at the stake or 
public cas — ” 

“I don’t want to hear it. I don’t 
want to do it.” 

“You have no choice, of course.” 
“Ah, but I do,” Otto said, 
tensing. “All I have to do is kill you 
before you can — ” 

(( wjULPY — rouge — battery — ca- 
X^shew!” Dr. Ellis shouted. 
Otto slumped in the chair, face 



slack. Dr. Ellis sighed and blotted 
his forehead, got up and rummag- 
ed in a file until he found a bolster- 
ed laser. He beat the dust off it, sat 
down again, drew out the gun and 
pointed it at the center of Otto’s 
chest. “Cashew. Battery. Rouge. 
Pulpy.” 

Otto shook his head to clear it 
and looked down the barrel of the 
weapon. Quietly: “Put that god- 
damn thing away before you elec- 
trocute yourself. The battery selec- 
tor’s on ‘charge.’” 

No ten-year-old would fall for 
that, but Dr. Ellis had evidently 
spent his youth in the pursuit of 
scholarship. He reversed the wea- 
pon to look at the power matrix, 
holding it very gingerly. Otto 
smacked it out of his hand and, not 
moving too swiftly, picked it up off 
the rug. 

“Pulpy, uh— ” 

“No.” Otto had the weapon 
shoulder-high, the muzzle of it 
wavering a meter from the man’s 
nose. “Calm down.” 

He went back to his chair, 
keeping the doctor covered, and 
sat. He shook his head. 

“You bureaucrats are really 
max. Really max. Can’t take a 
joke.” He tossed the gun to the 
doctor’s desk but didn’t quite make 
it. It clattered against the edge and 
went spinning to the floor. 

“That’s government property,” 
Ellis said. 

“So am I, damn it.” Otto leaned 
back and started when a joint 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT

popped loudly. “So am I.” He 
studied the doctor for a few silent 
seconds. “Go on. I’m this murder- 
er — ’’ 

“Ah. Yes.” Ellis relaxed, lacing 
his fingers together. “But let’s not 
get ahead of ourselves. We have a 
problem on Selva.” 

“I gathered.” 

“Um, yes, it’s a problem, on the 
level you’re operating, it’s a prob- 
lem of murder. Of systematic 
assassination, really.” 

“So I’m an assassin.” 

“In a — manner of speaking. But 
the problem is much larger than 
that.” 

“I should hope.” 

“Yes, well, it’s war.” 

“So? Nothing in the Charter — ” 
“Interplanetary war.” 

Otto leaned forward, smiling 
slightly. “Interp/anetary war? 
You’re pulling my fern. Nobody — ” 
“I know.” He sighed. “We’re 
getting ahead of ourselves again.” 
“Begin at the beginning, then.” 
“I was going to say, yes. Do you 
know anything about Selvan poli- 
tics?” 

“Look, I can’t keep up with every 
jerkwater — ” 

“All right. That’s what I thought. 
Don’t worry, your persona knows 
all it has — ” 

“Of course. Go on.” 



^^vi|7ELL, Selva is classified as 
W an hereditary-representa- 
tive oligarchy.” 



“Like you say. I’ll know all of 
this.” 

“Patience, please. There are 
forty-two hereditary clans who send 
one representative apiece to an 
inter-clan ruling council, the Se- 
nado Grande. This representative 
is the eldest son of the head of the 
clan. He will eventually head up the 
clan himself and send his son to the 
Senado. ” 

“Just a puppet for the old man, I 
assume.” 

“Generally, yes. In practice, the 
Senado serves as a training ground, 
preparing the young men for the 
more difficult job waiting for them 
when their fathers die or step down. 
Selva doesn’t have a strong central 
government; hasn’t had one for 
centuries, and the Senado just 
formalizes into law agreements 
made between the various clan 
heads in secret meetings.” 

“Very advanced.” 

“Weil, it works. They started out 
neo-Maoist — anyhow, here’s the 
problem: 

“On Selva, serious personal dif- 
ferences between adult males are 
generally settled by dueling — ” 

“Dueling!” 

“Yes, it’s a delightful planet. 
Usually they duel with swords, 
sometimes with more exotic wea- 
pons. The outcome of the duel 
usually is just a wounding — first 
blood wins the argument — but over 
serious matters they sometimes 
duel to the death.” 

“I haven’t handled a sword since 



10 



GALAXY 




training! That’s fifteen years — ” 
“That long? Well, don’t worry, 
your persona is quite expert. The 
boy he murdered he murdered 
with — ’’ 

“Boy? The boy he murdered?’’ 
“He was sixteen, just a few days 
past his sixteenth birthday. That’s 
the legal age limit for duels. Which 
is at the bottom of your assign- 
ment. Let me explain. The man 
behind this interplanetary war idea 
is a clan head named Alvarez. He 
wants to attack Grunwelt — ’’ 

“Oh, I’ve heard of — ’’ 

“Yes, Grunwelt is a comparative- 
ly prosperous world. Unlike Selva, 
it has stayed in the mainstream of 
Confederation life. And they’re 
practically next-door neighbors. 
They come as close as sixty million 
kilometers, at opposition.” 

“What do they want to start a 
war for? Haven’t they ever heard 
of—” 

“October? Sure, they’ve heard of 
October. In their schools, they 
teach that it’s a myth, that the Con- 
federation is too spineless ever 
to—” 

“Still, why an interplanetary 
war?” 

E llis shrugged. “This man 
Alvarez — well, for generations 
Selvans have been jealous of Grun- 
welt. Alvarez is playing on this jea- 
lousy. Reduced to the simplest of 
terms, he proposes to swoop in and 
loot the world.” 

“Is Grunwelt aware — ” 



“Only our representative there. 
They don’t have any espionage 
system on Selva — they’ve never 
seen her as a potential threat. How 
could they? Selva has only two 
working interplanetary vessels, not 
even a Class II spaceport.” 

“Then how does Selva propose 
to—” 

“That’s the funny thing. They 
could do it. Sneak attack with ten, 
twelve small ships. Bomb a couple 
of cities, threaten to bomb more, 
collect the booty and return. Leave 
a couple of ships in orbit as insur- 
ance against retaliation.” 

“Never work.” 

“I know it wouldn’t work and 
you know it wouldn’t work and I 
suspect that Alvarez knows, too. 
We can only guess at what he’s 
actually up to.” 

“Power base, I suppose. He’ll 
use the scheme to make himself top 
man on Selva.” 

“And then perhaps blackmail 
himself into a position of power on 
Grunwelt. Who knows? That’s one 
thing you may be able to find out. 
The man you’ll be impersonating is 
Ramos Guajana. You’re one of 
four or five skilled duelists who 
have been systematically assassi- 
nating, not those who oppose 
Alvarez, but the sons of that oppo- 
sition.” 

“As soon as they turn sixteen.” 

“When practical.” Ellis lit up a 
stick and passed the box to 
McGavin. “It’s all very legal.” 

“I’m sure. Thanks. But question: 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT 



11 




how could this wreck, Guajana, 
bump off anything bigger than a 
cockroach?” 

“Oh, you’re normally in much 
better shape. Guajana’s been im- 
prisoned'for over two months — 
starvation diet, beatings almost 
daily. You’ll be in good fighting 
trim soon after you escape.” 

“But first I have to starve down 
to where I can slip through the 
bars?” 

“Oh, no. We have a foolproof 
plan.” Ellis looked at his watch. 
“You’ll get more detailed orders on 
the ship. Put out your cigarette, 
we’ve got to — ” 

“There’s not that big a rush,” 
Otto said. He smoked slowly for a 
few minutes. Then he put out the 
stick and returned to his chair, and 
Ellis put him under with a sequence 
of nonsense words. 

“When you awaken,” Dr. Ellis 
said confidently, “you will be about 
ten per cent Otto McGavin and 
ninety per cent Ramos Guajana. 
Your response to any normal situ- 
ation will be consistent with Gua- 
jana’s personality and abilities. 
Only in times of extreme emergency 
will you be able to call upon your 
skills as a prime operator. 

“Pulpy. Rouge. Battery. Ca- 
shew.” He pushed a call button 
under his desk. 

Guajana/Otto shook his head 
twice and looked across the desk 
with clear eyes full of pain. His face 
had changed in subtle ways. 

“I will remember you. Doctor.”

Most of it detailed Otto’s mis- 
sion. From past experience, he 
knew that ninety-nine per cent of 
the planning would be worthless 
after the first day or two. And as far 
as the reams of data about the man 
he was impersonating — normally 
that would also be useless; if he 
ever consciously had to act like the 
man, it would mean his PO was 
fading and he would soon have to 
fight or run for his life. 

But most personality overlays are 
done in hypnotic rapport between 
the agent and the person he is going 
to impersonate. In this case that 
was impossible; Guajana couldn’t 
be kidnapped for a month and have 
his copy remain of any use. So they 
had examined and profiled Gua- 
jana as well as possible, and Otto 
was a very good academic copy of 
the man. He lacked the important 
artificial memories that would have 
been overlayed in hypnotic rap- 
port — but he could make a good 
case for having been beaten into 
amnesia. 

So Otto memorized all of the in- 
formation about Guajana, just in 
case, which was not too pleasant: 
Guajana was about the most vil- 
lainous person Otto had ever im- 
personated. Cold-blooded murder- 
er of children. Well, maybe he had 
a good side. Kind to snakes or 
something.

this copy — on a glorious October morning — 
Pioneer 10 is speeding toward Its rendezvous 
with Jupiter on December 3, passing only 
85,000 miles from the planet’s surface. At

What do we actually know about that my-

Actually, not a whole lot. But that has not

come to compare the spemlatjons made by 
our own sf pioneers with the actual data

To mark this historic occasion, Carol and

des on a cloudy, absolutely starless 
night. His timing was very bad. 

The T-46 is about as automated 
as a spaceship can be. It locks in on 
a landing signal — generated in this 
case by Otto’s TBII liaison — and 
casts about for the nearest thirty- 
meter stretch of level ground on 
which to land. But the signal in this 
case was being generated from the 
top of a steep hill in the middle of a 
rain forest so up-and-down that it 
would drive a cartographer insane. 

The ship glided to a stop and 
Otto pulled from a pocket of his 
rags a simple signal detector/- 
rangefinder that told him he was 
12.8 kilometers south-southeast of 
where he wanted to be. A small 
error in a 145-light-year journey, 
but Otto/Ramos was understand- 
ably upset. 

As said, the T-46 is very auto- 
matic. Its function is to land an 
agent safely and get away — its door 
opens and the agent has sixty sec- 
onds to clear out. In this case, it 
was upsetting, because one of the 
things Otto had read in his 
100-page report indicated that only 
rabid sportsmen and other fools 
ventured out into Selvan jungles at 
night. 

Otto got out and felt the ship 
depart silently behind his back. 
Laser ready, with his left hand he 
adjusted his nightglasses and tight- 
ened the shoulder straps of his kit. 
He looked around and saw nothing 
but then felt a crawly sensation 
center on his back and whirled.

GALAXY 




At neck level and ten meters 
away a batlike creature with a three- 
meter wingspan and an excessive 
number of claws and teeth was 
sliding rapidly through the air with 
a bloodthirsty grin on what served 
it for a face. It seemed to weigh 
about as much as a human child 
and screamed like a child when the 
laser opened it up in midflight and 
it tumbled suddenly graceless over 
Otto’s head to crash into the tall 
grass beyond him, where it thrash- 
ed twice. There was a second’s still- 
ness and then a slithering sound 
and then the sound of strong jaws 
crushing bone. 

In the flare of the laser Otto had 
seen a hundred pairs of hungry 
eyes. There was no way to whistle 
the ship back from its slow ascent 
to orbit. 

Perhaps it is better in some abso- 
lute sense to accept a known 
danger, however great, than to 
forge off into the unknown. Otto 
knew that the woods likely held a 
more interesting variety of fauna 
than this small veldt — but in the 
thick growth, nothing would glide 
silently smiling upward the back of 
his neck. He checked his direction 
bump against the small rangefinder 
and set off north by northwest. 

Twice in ten steps Otto fired at 
nothing. He started to curse himself 
for wasting power and then on the 
twelfth step, a red snake with a 
head the size of a man’s and eyes 
that actually did glow lunged for 
Otto’s belt buckle. After the laser 



severed its head, the body coiled 
and writhed through eight long 
meters of gra^s. For all the years of 
training and conditioning and ex- 
perience, Otto suddenly had no 
control over the toroidal muscle 
that makes elimination a polite and 
private function. His anal sphincter 
bucked and spasmed in that final 
reflex that tries to make a trapped 
creature an unpleasant meal. There 
was no room in his mind for 
thankfulness that he had taken the 
elementary precaution that kept 
him from fouling himself — there 
was nothing in his head but primi- 
tive panic from ear to ear and he 
screamed and ran blindly for two 
seconds, hit dirt in a flat dive, 
rolled and came up firing. The 
laser’s beam made a brilliant arc 
swinging back and forth in front of 
him, then behind, saving his life 
when it killed the bat-creature’s 
mate. When he took his finger off 
the trigger the glade was in 
crackling flames that dimmed and 
smoldered out in the dampness. 
At the edge of the wood something 
gave a bad imitation of a human 
laugh and Otto’s self-preserving 
panic reached so high a level that it 
flipped the final mental switch the 
conditioners had put into his brain 
and he was suddenly ice. 

McGavin, you are going to die. 

I know that, McGavin. 

Do you know what to do before 
you die? 

Kill! 

A man who might know once

said that there is no creature in the 
galaxy more dangerous than man. 
At any rate, few men could be as 
dangerous as one who has given up 
all hope for his own survival — add 
to that twenty-three years of experi- 
ence in mayhem and you may have 
the only kind of man who could 
possibly survive three hours alone 
at night in a Selvan jungle. 

T ^HE fact that nighttime is so 
hostile on Selva was the single 
most important influence on the 
strange evolution of Selvan politics. 
The planet was originally colonized 
by five hundred idealistic volun- 
teers from the Terran country of 
Uruguay; members of the Pro- 
grama Politico de Mao, who had 
bought the planet cheaply from a 
mining corporation that couldn’t 
find anybody willing to run their 
machines. 

El Programa arrived with a nice 
efficient setup, a division of duties 
and rewards that might have 
worked very well in a more hospit- 
able environment. 

The mining company had not 
totally misled them about the 
danger of Selva — they came with 
guns and electric fences and grim 
determination and absolutely no 
desire to go near the jungle at 
night. But to the planet they were 
just so many relatively accessible 
pieces of protein dropped in the 
middle of about the most competi- 
tive land ecology ever discovered — 



25,000 kilograms of monster meat. 

They lost nearly a hundred 
members the first day and the same 
number in the week that followed. 
The next week forty vanished, then 
seventeen and then eight. 

It would perhaps be naive to 
infer that a primitive kind of 
natural selection was going on, that 
only the toughest survived. There 
may have been some element of 
that, but far more important was 
the factor of simple luck and prac- 
tice. They had all been farmers 
by profession — and temperament — 
and no farmer, however tough, 
could know enough about knee- 
jerk killing to stay alive long on 
Selva — except by luck. If he lived 
and learned he eventually needed 
less luck — although he became a 
less pleasant neighbor. 

Inexorably, in less than one 
generation, what had been intend- 
ed as a gentle experiment in 
communal living degenerated into 
a bizarre association of mutually 
suspicious clans, a system more 
appropriate to the fourteenth cen- 
tury than the twenty-third. 

It started with the status of 
women. In El Programa, women 
were supposed to have been abso- 
lutely equal to men, except for 
performing the special function of 
childbirth. To keep the colony from 
becoming inbred, the planners had 
included ten thousand sets of 
sperm and egg, ready for quicken- 
ing; all of the expedition’s men had 
allowed themselves to be sterilized.

GALAXY 




With what were then considered 
modern medical techniques, a wo- 
man could give birth in four to five 
months after implantation. 

By the time the population had 
stabilized, at around 200, it was 
obvious that every female had to be 
kept pregnant every day for the rest 
of her life, until her womb cried 
uncle, or the race would wither on 
the vine. And she had to be pro- 
tected from Selva, which was vir- 
tually a sentence of life imprison- 
ment, with time off for old age. 

At first the women were kept in 
the five colonizing vessels, now 
useless as transportation but proof 
against teeth and claws. The men 
stayed with them at night, and 
ventured out during the day to 
hunt, which was easy, and try to 
farm, rather difficult with one eye 
and one hand otherwise occupied. 

After some ten years they did 
manage to build high fortifications 
around each ship. The electric 
fences, which had proved useless 
before because dead creatures 
would just pile up and eventually 
make a bridge, were unraveled and 
restrung as barriers against the 
gliding monsters. 

Population pressure shoved the 
walls outward as the years went by. 
The people lived first in capsules, 
then stockades, then forts and 
finally in walled towns. Eventually 
five towns grew together to form the 
sprawling city of Castile Cervantes. 

There were schools, but they 
taught a minimum of academic

subjects and a maximum of how to 
stay alive. 

Most of the first generation still 
considered themselves communists. 
The second generation thought 
communism was ridiculous. The 
third generation was sentimental 
about it and by the tenth genera- 
tion very few people knew what it 
was. 

With the women locked away 
like precious jewelry and the men 
spending half their waking hours in 
the expectation or dispensation of 
bloody murder, it was not surpris- 
ing that an ugly form of social or- 
ganization should develop. Since 
strength and ruthlessness were the 
only survival traits the strongest 
and most ruthless went to the top 
and made their own rules. 

They conquered their own planet 
in three hundred years. When they 
started looking for other worlds to 
conquer, they broke one of the very 
few interplanetary laws — and the 
Confederation, through its clandes- 
tine TBII arm, sent one man to 
check out the situation. 

O tto mcgavin was still alive 
when dawn broke and the mis- 
cellaneous uglies tromped or slith- 
ered or flopped or flapped back to 
their holes and caves. 

He sat exhausted in the middle of 
a wide circle of burned, bizarre- 
looking meat. That was what saved 
him. He hadn’t had to fire a single 
shot in the past hour — Selva’s 
night-foragers naturally preferred a 



freshly dead meal to going to the 
trouble of killing the new one that 
spat fire. 

When the sun cleared the top of 
the jungle canopy Otto saw no sign 
of life in either the jungle or the 
clearing. Finally feeling safe, he 
automatically slipped back into the 
Ramos Guajana personality. He 
shook a fist at the dead creatures 
and shouted a joyful curse. Then he 
removed the sheath knife from the 
side of his kit, sliced a chunk of 
thigh from one of a creature’s six 
and cheerfully munched on it as he 
plunged into the jungle. 

At Ramos’s normal walking 
speed, he could cover 12.8 kilo- 
meters in a comfortable hour-and- 
a-half. But jungle trails are slow 
going and it was nearing dusk — 
Ramos starting to get worried — 
when he broke into a clearing at the 
base of a steep hill. A handsome 
brick-and-stone building, evidently 
a lodge of some sort, sat on the top 
of the hill. Halfway up the hill a 
moat protected a substantial wall 
topped with electric webbing. He 
followed the path up the hill to the 
moat. A steelite drawbridge lower- 
ed and Ramos, wake-up jungle 
noises at his back, hurried across 
it. Another steelite door inside and 
the drawbridge rose behind him, 
trapping him in a small area. 

“I am not programed to admit 
you,” a metallic voice said, “and 
the proprietress is not at home to 
identity you.” A light came on in a 
little alcove to his left. “You are 



1B 



GALAXY 




protected from the night, however, 
and there are sanitary facilities and 
food machines to your left.” There 
sure were — all coin-operated. All 
he had was in large bills — and 
counterfeit at that. 

“Can you change a fifty?” he 
asked the machine. 

“Repeat, please.” 

“Can you change a fifty?” 

“I am not programed to admit 
you — ” 

“Oh, shut up!” That was evi- 
dently in its programing — it shut 
up. 

When he picked the lock on the 
toilet the light went out. 

ER an hour of darkness Otto 
heard a hovercraft land on the 
top of the hill. A few minutes later 
the door to his little cell opened. He 
was crouched behind the sandwich 
machine, laser centered on the door 
at navel-level. 

“Guajana,” a female voice said, 
“Ramos Guajana?” 

"Si. Aqui. ’’ He suddenly remem- 
bered that he hadn’t put on night- 
glasses. 

“Ah, there you are.” She must 
have had hers on. “Put away that 
gun and take my hand. I’ll guide 
you up to the place.” They walked 
up a steep path. “I’ve been trying 
to find you,” she said. “I discover- 
ed where you spent the night. Very 
impressive.” 

He didn’t say anything. 

How many months since he had 
been this close to a woman? His 



hand sweated, clammy in her warm 
soft one. He felt wave upon wave of 
sexual tension so acute it affected 
stomach more than loins, every 
time he stumbled into a rounded 
hip or backside. 

“Hey, keep your hands to your- 
self.” 

“Mierde, no veo, " he growled. 
With effort: “Sorry, I can’t see.” 

“Uh-huh. Well, we’re almost 
there.” Ramos could make out the 
gray bulk of the lodge looming 
against the black sky. “And here 
we are.” She stopped and worked a 
heavy-sounding iron lock. ‘‘The 
Vista Hermosa Hotel. ‘Hotel of 
the beautiful view,”’ she translated 
needlessly. “Went out of business 
twenty years ago — watch your 
step — and the Confederation 
bought it through proxies.” They 
were inside, walking over a musty- 
smelling carpet. 

‘‘For such an emergency as 
this?” 

‘‘No. Actually the reason is 
pretty simple. They thought for a 
while that the Senado was moving 
to Paracho, wanted a cheap place 
for a consulate. Got stuck with it. 
Stairs.” Ramos hit the first tread as 
she said that. He stumbled and, 
groping, found her calf. 

He touched her again standing 
up and she showed her affection 
with a stinging slap. 

Coolly Ramos grabbed her wrist 
and twisted her off-balance. He fell 
on top of her, pinning her under his 
knee, and pressed the muzzle of the 




THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT 



19 




pistol to her throat, swearing 
gutturally. He snapped off the 
safety and then slowly clicked it 
back on. He stood up. 

“Sorry. Please remember. I am 
Ramos Guajana.” 

She regained her feet with a 
rustling of full skirts. Her voice 
quavered. “I know. But I am what 
I am, too. On Shalom we — don’t 
touch people that way!” 

Nothing to say, Ramos shifted 
the pack on his back noisily. 

She sighed. “Still, we can’t risk a 
light. Give me your hand. It’s not 
much farther.” 

They went to the top of the stairs 
and down a corridor to the left. The 
door to Otto’s quarters opened 
noiselessly and closed with a solid 
snap. 

“Thumbprint lock. We’ll reset 
it.” The lights came on, dazzling. 

T \ HE windowless room had three 
pieces of cheap furniture: an 
airbed in one corner and a wooden 
desk and chair in another. A small 
holo cube on the desk showed' the 
inside of a cell where a man was 
sleeping. Beside the desk was a 
rack holding seven swords. Ramos 
crossed to it and ran his fingers 
lightly along the blades. “Ade- 
quate,” he said. He pulled one out 
of the rack and made a few passes 
at an imaginary foe. Then he 
looked closely at the sword. 

“I’ll need a whetstone and a 
leather strop. And a roll of tape for 
these handles. Black tape, the kind 



electricians use.” For the first time, 
he looked up and saw the girl. 

“Uh — ” By the standards of Sha- 
lom, she was a plain-looking 
woman. Which meant she was 
perhaps less perfect of figure and 
feature than Helen of Troy. She 
was dressed the way young women 
all dressed in this part of Selva, a 
clinging velvety bodice revealing 
only the tops of her breasts, clasp- 
ing her body down to just past the 
hipbones, swelling out into a full 
ruffled skirt, long by Earth stan- 
dards. 

Considering that nine-tenths of 
him had been three times jailed for 
rape and ten-tenths had been 
locked up in a tiny T-46 for weeks, 
Ramos reacted in a fairly gentle- 
manly way: he dropped the sword, 
snarled and took three steps toward 
her, clutching — 

And from an intimate place she 
produced a small black pistol. 
“Now you stay right where you 
are!” she said, more hysteria than 
menace in her voice. But it was 
quite obvious that she was going to 
burn him down in another second 
and the sense of immediate dan- 
ger put Otto in full control of the 
body. 

His own pistol was lying on top of 
his kit, which he had dropped from 
his back in the center of the room. 
If she were any kind of a marksman 
she could hit him five or six times 
before he’d be able to reach it. He 
put his hands on top of his head. 

“Now, now,” he said. “Don’t get 



20 



GALAXY 




excited, it’s just — heh, well — you 
know — ” 

“It’s like they say,” she said, a 
little more calmly, curiously, 
“You’re actually two people.” 

“That’s correct.’’ He bowed 
slightly at the waist, hands still on 
top of his head. “Otto McGavin, at 
your service.” 

“Well, you better stay ‘Otto Mc- 
Gavin’ for a while.” She lowered 
the pistol. “What a strange name 
you’ve — ” 

Ramos dropped his hands to his 
side, fingers clawed, and began 
inching forward. She brought up 
the pistol again and he raised his 
hands, more slowly this time. 

“Can’t you control yourself for 
just one second?” 

“Calm, please, calm down now — 
uh — no. Actually I can’t exactly 
control it. When I’m not in im- 
mediate danger I have to act like 
Guajana. The compulsion is auto- 
matic. Otherwise I might acciden- 
tally, you know, act out of char- 
acter.” 

She was backing toward the 
door. “Well, don’t think for a 
second you’re going to act in char- 
acter with me.” Hand on the knob. 
“I don’t think we’ll reset the lock 
after all. Not until I figure out what 
to do with you.” She snapped off 
the lights, jumped through the door 
and slammed it behind her. 

A fraction of a second later, 
Ramos crashed into the locked 
door. "Cago en la leche de la madre 
de su madre! " he raged. He 



pounded on the door with his fists, 
cursing ever more imaginatively 
and loudly for a few minutes. Then 
he walked heavily across the dark 
room and felt his way to the bed. 

Ill 

m^7AKE UP, McGavin, Gua- 
W jana — whatever your name 
is.’’ Ramos snapped awake and 
looked around but there was no one 
in the room. Then he saw her small 
image in the holo cube 

“Goat bitch,” he said illogically, 
sneering, “I no longer desire you. 
Set me free that I might go find a 
female of my own species.” 

She sniffed contemptuously. 
“Sooner or later, you’ll be free 
enough. Right now, there’s work to 
be done.” She faded away and was 
replaced by the image of the real 
Ramos Guajana, sitting in his cell. 
The resemblance to Otto/Ramos 
was fairly exact. 

Her voice over Ramos’s image: 
“Notice that he has a new lump on 
his head and a healing cut on his 
lip. He got these fighting with a 
guard, day before yesterday.” 

“We have orders saying you must 
match him as near perfectly as 
possible before you can begin your 
mission. It would be dangerous to 
risk cosmetics, of course, so we are 
going to have to inflict similar in- 
juries on — ” 

“Please come and try.” 

“That won’t be necessary. Not 
me personally, anyhow.” 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT 



21 




The door to his quarters swung 
open, and a big ugly specimen 
stood there, with a gun in one 
hand, a padded club in the other. 

“Sorry, Colonel McGavin,” he 
said, raising* the gun. “Anesthe- 
tic.” He fired as Otto tensed to 
leap. 

R amos woke up with a pulsating 
ache in his head and a swollen 
stinging lip. He counted teeth with 
his tongue; they were all there but a 
couple were loose. 

“There’s some analgesic in the 
desk drawer. Colonel.” The man 
who had put him to sleep and, pre- 
sumably, knocked him around 
while he was unconscious, was still 
in the room. Or again in the 
room — he’d gotten rid of the gun 
and the club. He was sitting against 
the far wall with two swords and 
two clear plastic helmets. 

“Call me Ramos,” Ramos/Otto 
said, going to the desk. Standing 
up and walking produced a sensa- 
tion not unlike probing his temple 
with an icepick. Ramos touched the 
side of his head and closed his eyes 
for a second, tried to ignore the 
pain and failed. 

He took the pill and touched his 
lip gingerly. “1 suppose I should 
thank you. Do you render this 
service often?” 

“Not for cosmetic purposes.” 
The other man stood up. “Thought 
you might like to go a couple of 
rounds. These are practice swords, 
epees.” He tossed one to Ramos, 



who caught it by the handle without 
effort. “You feel up to it?” 

“I suppose.” Actually, Ramos/ 
Otto felt a thousand per cent 
better, even with the new lumps, 
than he had in Dr. Ellis’s office on 
Earth. The Personality Overlay 
people had had to overdo the 
damage to his body, to allow for 
healing during the four weeks’ 
transit. He wasn’t up to normal 
pitch, for either Guajana or Mc- 
Gavin, but he had some measure of 
strength and swiftness back. 

“Frankly,” the big man said 
while Ramos tested the balance and 
temper of the weapon, “I’m skepti- 
cal. I don’t see how they can teach 
you in a few weeks what took 
Guajana most of his life to master.” 

Ramos shrugged. “It’s only tem- 
porary.” He sized up his opponent. 
The big man moved with a grace 
that seemed almost effeminate for a 
man of his size. He had all of the 
physiological advantages for fenc- 
ing — he was taller than Ramos by a 
head and a half, had long arms and 
legs. But Ramos knew that people 
with a long reach and long lunge 
tended to get over-confident with a 
small opponent. It would be fun, 
setting him up for the kill. 

Ramos adjusted the helmet, a 
cool porous plastic shield that 
protected his face and ears and 
throat. 

“I’ll take it easy at first,” the 
other man said. 

“No need.” They took up posi- 
tions in the center of the room. 



22 



GALAXY 




Ramos noted that his opponent’s 
blade was canted out of line to the 
right by more than two centimeters, 
exposing a little too much shoulder 
and forearm. The big man either 
had bad form or had set up a trap, 
not terribly subtle. Without think- 
ing about it, Ramos executed an 
attack that would take care of 
either alternative — in one motion 
feinting to the exposed forearm, 
slipping under the expected parry, 
then double-disengage (bellguard 
high for this line against the possi- 
bility of stop-thrust or out-of-time 
remise), lunge and the blunted 
point thumped to rest precisely 
between the third and fourth ribs. 

“Tocar," the big man acknowl- 
edged, fingering thoughtfully the 
spot where he had been touched. 
“I’ll have to be more careful.” 

H e was more careful and very 
good by anybody’s standards, 
but in five engagements Ramos 
scored five touches. None of the 
clashes lasted more than a few 
seconds. The longest was attack- 
parry-riposte-parry-remise- parry- 
re remise- touch. 

“Very strange.” The man took 
off his mask. “Colonel, uh, Ramos, 
I mean — you say they taught you 
how to fence like Guajana?” 
“That’s right.” 

“But I’ve fenced with Guajana — 
liundreds of times! And — ” 

“And you’re still alive?” 

“No, no, not dueling. He was my 
coach five, six years ago. That’s 



why — anyhow, you don’t really 
fence that much like him. A casual 
opponent wouldn’t see it, tiut I 
know where his weaknesses are — 
I’ve even beaten him a few times. 
You don’t have those weaknesses, 
not those particular ones.” 

“Ah.” Ramos’s brow furrowed, 
searching his memory of the mis- 
sion profile. “Well, it’s under- 
standable. I had to get it second- 
hand, since the real Guajana was 
stuck here. They got the best fenc- 
ing masters they could find and had 
them study tapes of Guajana at 
work. Then the masters taught me 
in tandem, simultaneously, all of us 
under hypnosis. So I got imprinted 
with a kind of average impression 
of Guajana’s style.” 

“Complicated,” the man said. 
“But easy, compared to learning 
the real way. I’m glad it doesn’t 
last.” 

“I wish it could last a little 
longer. I’ve got to wrap up this 
project before the imprinting starts 
to fade. Two months at the very 
most.” 

“Anything I can do to help, of 
course — ” 

“No. Don’t even say it. You 
don’t want to help; you don’t even 
want to know anything more about 
this than you do now. Same goes 
for that bitch — ” 

“Rachel?” The big man looked 
hurt. “But — she’s the TBII liai- 
son.” 

“Something this backwoods 
planet shouldn’t even have! I never

feel safe on an assignment where 
somebody else knows my true iden- 
tity. People have a nasty way of 
being compelled to talk. So far, two 
of you know who I am. How many 
others — the whole embassy staff?” 
“No, we’re the only two.” 

“Then the best thing you could 
do for me, both of you, would be to 
get off-planet. Right now.” 

((m iTR. GUAiANA,” came a thin 
_[^_£voice, Rachel’s, from the 
cube, “try to remember that we are 
the officially appointed representa- 
tives of the Confederation on this 
planet. You are only a tool, a spe- 
cialist sent to aid us in the resolu- 
tion of this problem. It’s still our 
respons — 

“You know, I don’t give a 
flying — ” Ramos stopped, continu- 
ed in a lower voice: “Deep down 
inside, I don’t really care whether 
Selva builds a thousand warships 
and blasts Grunwelt back to the 
Stone Age. I would never even have 
heard of Selva if your Alvarez 
hadn’t come down with a big Attila 
complex.” Normally, Guajana re- 
membered vaguely, he was very 
polite and suave with ladies. 

“Then I wouldn’t say that you 
were ideally motivated for your 
job,” she said scornfully. “Don’t 
you have even a little sympathy 
for—” 

“Sympathy, motivation, 
mierda." He took a deep breath 
and tried to calm down. “Sympa- 
thies can change and motivation is 



a simple word for something no- 
body understands. / do a good job, 
the best job I can, because I’ve 
been conditioned down to the last 
brain cell and stringy nerve to com- 
plete my mission. I am totally 
reliable because nobody but the 
TBII has the knowledge and equip- 
ment to break my conditioning.” 
“You are a thoroughly despic- 
able person.” 

“Because I pinched your butt? 
Big deal. Big — ” 

“Please!” The big man was 
patting the air with both hands, 
conciliatory. “Rachel, nobody ques- 
tions your motivation and. Colonel, 
nobody questions your condition- 
ing. Why don’t we just drop all this 
and get down to the problem at 
hand?” 

“One little matter first,” Ramos 
said, still fuming, “I know who 
Rachel Eshkol is — she was identi- 
fied in my orders — but who the hell 
are you?” 

“Octavio de Sanchez. I work for 
the embassy.” 

“Well, I’m glad she didn’t just 
pick you up off the street. What do 
you do at the embassy, when you’re 
not dabbling in espionage?” 

“Well, ah. I’m a data analyst for 
the Vital Statistics section.” 

“And how does this qualify you 
to be in on our little secret?” 

“I needed somebody,” Rachel 
began. 

“You didn’t even need yourself!” 
“I needed somebody of unim- 
peachable loyalty who knew Gua-

jana well. To check your disguise, 
your acting.” 

“Who’s acting? What disguise? 
I — am — Ramos — Guajana.” 

“He talks just like him,” Octavio 
said. 

“See?” Ramos threw up his 
hands. “For this you doubled my 
risk of exposure.” 

“Octavio de Sanchez is absolute- 
ly trustworthy.” Her image in the 
cube was leaning forward, flushed 
with anger. 

“Oh, you want to get into that 
orbit. Octavio, old sport, if I 
offered you a million P’s to go over 
to Alvarez’s side — ” 

“No. He is too unutterably — ” 

“Two million? Five? Ten? Your 
life? To keep your children from 
being tortured to death? Your 
mother?” 

“Yes, I see. Of course. If the 
price were enough any man 
would — ” 

“Any man or woman on this 
planet — except me.” 

S ILENCE for a few seconds. 

Then: “Why don’t you just get 
rid of us — mere mortals,” Rachel 
said. 

“I considered it,” Ramos snap- 
ped. “And 1 didn’t reject it just be- 
cause 1 thought you might be of 
some use to me later on. You won’t 
be.” 

“Then why not just kill us?” 

“Or try,” Octavio added, flexing 
the practice sword. 

“For one thing, it would draw 



unnecessary attention to the opera- 
tion. For another, even Ramos, the 
real Ramos, isn’t totally amoral. 
Certainly not impractical. He 
doesn’t go around killing people for 
sport — or just because their exis- 
tence inconveniences him.” 

“He’s killed sixteen people,” Oc- 
tavio said grimly. 

“Seventeen. But always for what 
he would consider good reason, at 
least sufficient profit.” I’ve killed 
almost that many, Otto thought, 
just to keep the Confederation run- 
ning smoothly. “Granted, he might 
require less reason than you would.” 
Octavio nodded. “Look, we’re 
still getting nowhere. Hadn’t we 
best go over the plan, coordinate 
our — ” 

“The plan is unworkable and is 
rejected as of now. Kidnaping 
Ramos and sneaking me into his 
cell, then having me escape — that’s 
the kind of goddamn comic opera 
thing Planning always dreams up.” 
“But we have orders — ” Rachel 
said firmly. 

“Look at the rank of the man 
who signed those orders and then 
consider my rank. The TBII may 
not be terribly efficient, but in 
some ways it isn’t stupid. The only 
reason I have any military rank at 
all is to keep people like you from 
hamstringing me.” 

“What’s your plan, then?” she 
said. “How is it any better?” 

“The less you know, the better 
for both of us. You may do two 
things for me and then, Octavio, 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT*

you can go back to your statistics 
and Srta. Eshkol can go back to — 
whatever she does for fun.” 

“That suits me fine,” she said 
with heat. “The sooner you get out 
of my life, the happier I’ll be.” 
“What would you like us to do. 
Colonel?” 

Ramos smiled at the cube for a 
second and turned back to Octavio. 
“First, get me reliable, inconspicu- 
ous transportation to Clan Alvarez. 
I suppose that would be a horse.” 
They make noises about interplan- 
etary war and still use draft animals 
to get around. “Then, when Tm 
ready to leave, get rid of the real 
Ramos.” 

“Kill him?” 

“That would be safest. Use your 
own judgment.” 

“You are forgetting that Sanchez 
and I are not casual murderers. 
We’ll kidnap him as planned 
before, and lock him up in the 
room you’re in now.” 

“All right. I advise you to take 
out the swords first.” 

When Octavio left, Ramos flop- 
ped down on the bed with a sigh of 
relief. It was hard work, trying to 
think like Otto and be Ramos at 
the same time. 

Starting tomorrow, he would 
have to move fast. A pity — he 
would’ve liked to supervise the 
abduction. Perhaps the prisoner 
would be killed while trying to 
escape. 

Thinking more like Ramos now, 
that’s good. 



T o GET to Clan Alvarez, Ramos 
had to go over two hundred 
kilometers, through Clans Tueme 
and Amarillo. It took him two full 
days, riding the spavined nag 
Octavio had supplied him. The 
second time he stopped for rest 
(and recreation), at an inn just 
across the Amarillo-Alvarez bor- 
der, the prostitute he hired turned 
out to have known Ramos for years. 
She remarked about how gentle 
he’d suddenly become, but seemed 
relieved rather than suspicious. 

What other important aspects of 
Guajana’s life did the PO section 
know absolutely nothing about? 
Ramos hoped his amnesia story 
would cover him. 

He had called the Vista Hermosa 
before crossing the Tueme border 
and Octavio had told him the ab- 
duction had gone smoothly, accord- 
ing to plan. No violence — ^just a 
certain amount of money passed 
around, some personnel suddenly 
transferred. Guajana was safely 
locked away in the hotel. There was 
a reward out for his recapture, but 
the physical description on the 
notice was inaccurate. The ruse 
would work for two days (before a 
new poster, with picture, would be 
issued), which gave Ramos/Otto 
plenty of time to get safely into 
Clan Alvarez. 

It was a tiring way to travel. 
Except for some of the larger 
towns, which had stone or maca- 



26 



GALAXY 




dam streets, most of the roads were 
crushed gravel. Every time a non- 
cquine transport passed it would 
pepper Ramos with a shower of 
pebbles and raise a cloud of dust 
that would take several minutes to 
settle in the hot still air. The big 
ground-effect trucks, which passed 
about every half-hour, were espec- 
ially diverting, giving Ramos a nice 
familiarity with the jungle. He 
learned from one painful experi- 
ence that horse and rider had to get 
behind a couple of meters of bush 
when one of the huge vehicles lum- 
bered by — that or die a slow death 
of flaying in one day’s journey. 

By the time he reached Alvarez, 
Ramos was covered with a half-cen- 
timeter of crushed dust, aching 
with scratches from thorns and 
Hung pebbles and nearly paralyzed 
with saddle sores. He left his horse 
at a public stable, soaked for an 
hour in a hot tub, had his larger 
wounds treated, bought a rough 
massage and a new suit of clothes 
and walked slightly bow-legged to 
the castle. 

The castle was an airy fantasy of 
glass and polished steelite — ob- 
viously new, although more than a 
century out of date by the architec- 
tural standards of more civilized 
planets. Guarding the front gate 
were two pairs of men with crossed 
pikes, trying not to look uncom- 
fortable in their foppish archaic 
uniforms. Their armament was 
more ornamental than functional, 
but it was backed up by two mega- 



watt-class lasers in shiny steelite 
bunkers flanking the road. A sign 
directed visitors to a small dome 
beside one of the bunkers. The 
laser’s large green eye tracked Otto 
as he passed in front of it. 

Inside, the dome had brick-red 
walls with black tile underfoot and 
what looked like a tiny woman seat- 
ed at a miniature desk across from 
the entrance. In the subdued light 
it was hard to see the faint cube 
lines, but she was obviously a holo- 
graphic projection. 

The woman was plain and looked 
efficient. “Please give me your 
name and the name of the depart- 
ment or person with whom you 
have business.’’ 

“My name is Ramos Mario 
Guajana. I believe I am to see el 
Alvarez.” 

“Oh — no, sir, that’s quite impos- 
sible.” She looked at him expec- 
tantly. Ramos stared back. 

“One moment, please.’’ She 
tapped out something on the key- 
board in front of her. “That’s 
Guajana with an ‘a’?” 

“Yes.” She tapped some more 
and watched a screen to her right. 

“Oh — Mayor Guajana, you are 
supposed to report directly to Com- 
mandante Rubirez — does he main- 
tain a regular office?” 

“Uh — I don’t know.’’ ‘Mayor’ 
Guajana? Another little detail that 
Planning had missed — Ramos/ 
Otto was a field-grade officer. 

“Let me see whether I can trace 
him.” She played with the key- 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT

board some more and talked 
quietly into a microphone. 

“Commandante Rubirez is in the 
library, in the Rare Books Room,” 
she said with a tone of disihissal. 
“Where’s that?” 

“Pardon me?” Furrowed brow, 
cocked head. 

“Look, I’m a field operative. I 
don’t know my way around this 
town. Where is the library?” With 
exaggerated simplicity, she told 
him: south half of the sixth floor. 

R amos/otto tried, with his new- 
ly-discovered majorhood, to 
pull rank on the palace guards 
when they asked for his sword. The 
captain of the guard coldly inform- 
ed him that the palace guard was 
outside the military’s chain of 
command and he could surrender 
his sword or be burned on the spot. 
He handed it over. A metal detector 
bleated as he walked through the 
gate. They got his pistol, too. 

Tangy cold inside the palace. 
Ramos realized it was the first air- 
conditioned air he had breathed 
since getting out of the little T-46. 
The first floor was all expensive 
woods and plush carpeting — medi- 
ocre paintings alternated with floor- 
to-ceiling mirrors on the walls. Too 
much empty space — it was an 
arrangement that owed less to 
aesthetic than to easy defense. Any 
or each of those mirrors could 
conceal a squad of armed men. 
Alone on the acre-sized rug, Ramos 
felt a hundred eyes on him. 



The elevator “boy” wore the 
palace guard uniform and was 
armed with short sword and laser 
pistol. He didn’t say a word and al- 
ready knew where Ramos/Otto was 
going. 

There was only one other person 
in the main room of the library, a 
clerk filing tapes behind a desk. He 
also was armed. Ramos was getting 
the feeling that everybody in the 
castle was armed, except TBII 
agents. 

“Which way to the Rare Books 
Room, amigo?" 

The clerk took off old-fashioned 
spectacles and blinked at Ramos. 
“You can’t go in there. Occupied.” 

“I know.” Ramos drummed his 
fingers on the desktop. “I have an 
appointment with the Comman- 
dante.” 

“Ah. This way.” The clerk led 
Ramos through a labyrinth of tape- 
files, periodical racks, bookcases. 
They came to a door marked with a 
single B. “Just a moment.” He 
rapped on the door and opened it 
slightly. 

‘‘I told you 1 was not to be 
disturbed,” came a frosty voice 
from inside. 

“A gentleman says he has an 
appointment with you, Comman- 
dante.” 

“I don’t have any appointments 
with anybody.” The clerk was a 
surprisingly fast draw — he had the 
pistol steady on Ramos’s breast- 
bone right after the Commandante 
said 7 don't . 



28 



GALAXY 




“I’ll get rid of him, Comman- 
dante.” 

“Wait,” Ramos said, almost 
shouting, “I’m Ramos Guajana.” 
“Ramos?” A book snapped shut. 
The sound of papers rustling and 
heavy footsteps muffled by carpet 
followed. A hirsute head thrust 
itself from behind the door, at a 
surprising height. 

“Ramos,” it growled with what 
might pass for affection. “Put that 
gun away, fool — Alvarez should 
have two such good men.” Two 
long strides and Rubirez enveloped 
Ramos in a crushing embrace. 
Then he held him by the shoulders 
and studied him, head wagging 
back and forth, looking oddly 
ursine. 

“They have used you poorly, old 
friend.” 

“Not as poorly as they might 
have, Commandante. I was to be 
hanged.” He shuddered. “Or 
worse.” 

“Commandante?” He took Ra- 
mos by the bicep; steered him into 
the Rare Books Room. “When was 
I other than Julio to you?” 

“Sir — Julio — that’s another 

thing. They beat me regularly, 
severely — ” 

“That’s evident.” 

“ — and I seem to have lost my 
memory. All memories of the past 
ten years or so.” He lowered him- 
self into an easy chair. “This 
seemed to be the logical place to go 
after I escaped — from the nature of 
their questioning.” He took a 



chance. “I do vaguely remember — 
you.” 

A SHADOW, perhaps doubt, passed 
over the Commandante’s 
bearded face, was gone. “And well 
you should.” He chuckled, turned 
around abruptly and scanned the 
leatherbound volumes lining the 
wall. He selected a thick book titled 
Philosophical Discourses, held it to 
his ear and shook it. It gurgled 
pleasantly. ‘“Philosophy is the 
highest music,”’ he quoted in 
Spanish, then removed the bottle 
and two glasses from the hollow 
book and decanted a healthy 
portion of brandy into each glass. 
He handed one to Ramos. 

“Grunweltische Branntwein. This 
is — ” he checked the label — “Eis- 
enmacher, 'thirty-six. It might be 
well to start developing a taste for 
it.” 

Ramos held up his glass. “We 
will fill swimming pools with it.” 
They laughed and drank. 

“Then you remember something 
of the Plan?” 

Ramos shrugged. “No more than 
is common knowledge. My cap- 
tors — is that the right word? — in 
Tueme implied that my killing that 
boy had something to do with it. I 
also got the impression that they 
were not too much in favor of the 
Plan.” 

“Not yet,” Rubirez said. “But we 
can bring them around. Or do 
without them. We’ve gotten the 
support of Diaz now, much more 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT

important. Heavy industry.” He 
stood up abruptly. “But we can 
talk about this later. You must be 
tired.” 

More curious than tired, Ramos/ 
Otto thought, but best not to press 
too much. 

He nodded. “It was an arduous 
journey.” 

“See Teniente Salazar down at 
the officers billets. I’ll call and 
make sure you get a good place.” 

“I’d be grateful.” 

“And — ah! Would you crave 
feminine companionship?” 

“In a relaxed sort of way, yes. 
My most urgent desires I satisfied 
at various inns between Tueme and 
here.” 

Julio clapped Ramos on the back 
— gently — and laughed. “Some 
things they could not change.” 

V 

R amos *found that his rank — 
which was new, he was told — 
entitled him to his choice of private 
quarters. Only two were available, 
though. Ramos took the second, 
even though it seemed more subtly 
bugged, because it was cleaner and 
he was expecting company. A girl 
named Ami Rivera — Julio had said 
Ramos and she had been close. 
And Julio had suggested Ramos 
warn her about his indisposition. 

A clerk brought over a bag of 
personal effects belonging to the 
real Guajana. Ramos found out 
disappointingly little about himself 



from the items in the bag. There 
were swords — blunted epee, saber 
and foil for practice. And func- 
tional sabre and epee. Three sets of 
clothes, civilian. No uniforms. An 
opened package of pistol targets. 
Three books from the castle li- 
brary — one of short stories and two 
on fencing theory (these were 
bound technical journals; Ramos 
looked for his own name but didn’t 
find it). The only thing that didn’t 
have some practical use was a 
beat-up harmonica, with no upper 
octave. There was also a little bag 
of things evidently dumped from a 
desk drawer — anonymous station- 
ery, pencil stub, eraser, two dried- 
out pens, postage stamps stuck to- 
gether, a half-smoked box of dope- 
sticks but no matches. 

Maybe the TBlI’s Sherlock sec- 
tion could comb through this col- 
lection and tell you everything from 
Guajana’s ring size to his prefer- 
ence in women. To Ramos/Otto 
McGavin, after an hour of close 
inspection it was still just five 
swords, three sets of clothes and a 
bunch of kipple. Anything he could 
infer from these he already knew. 

Ami came by about sundown and 
fixed Ramos timorlinos secos, a re- 
gional seafood specialty. She was a 
laughing, worldly, handsome wo- 
man about Ramos’s age. He en- 
joyed talking with her and making 
love with her and never could de- 
cide whether she’d been sent to spy 
on him. 

The next night was a slim young 



30 



GALAXY 




thing named Cecelia, who had 
rather more exotic tastes than Ami, 
but didn’t talk much. The third 
night it was one Private Martinez, 
rather dumpy and male, who had 
been sent to bring Ramos to the 
Commandante’s billet. 

Ramos had anticipated just a 
larger version of his own austere 
quarters, but Julio’s “billet” was a 
rambling stucco mansion in the 
shape of a squared U, built around 
a carefully tended garden. 

Julio was in the garden, sitting 
under a large tree at a table covered 
with papers. A bright lantern hang- 
ing from a branch above him hissed 
softly and threw a circle of soft 
yellow light around him; the smell 
of its burning mixed pleasantly 
with the perfumes of the garden. 
Julio was scribbling rapidly and 
didn’t hear Ramos and the private 
approach. The private cleared his 
throat, signaling. 

“Ah! Mayor Guajana. Sit, sit.” 
Julio waved at a chair across the 
table from him and went back to 
his writing. “I’ll only be a moment. 
Private, find the cook and bring us 
some wine and cheese.” 

AFTER a minute he laid the pen 
down with a slap and gathered 
the papers together. “Ramos,” he 
said, stacking the pages, “if they 
ever offer you a colonelcy, turn it 
down. It’s a first step to a lingering 
death by writer’s cramp.” He 
shoved the papers into a portfolio 
and laid it on the ground. “I have 



your next — ah.” He was silent 
while the soldier laid out four kinds 
of cheese and poured wine. 

“That will be all, private.” He 
sniffed the wine exuberantly and 
tasted it. "I suppose rank does have 
its privileges.” Ramos compared 
this opulence to Colonel McGavin’s 
Earthside quarters. He mumbled 
something in agreement, but pri- 
vately noted that rank’s privileges 
varied from army to army. 

“I have your next assignment, 
Ramos. Are you familiar with Clan 
Cervantes?” 

“Only as an area on the map.” 
The Commandante waggled his 
head in amazement. “And we 
visited it together — a two-week 
hunting trip, not five years ago.” 
“Can’t remember a thing about 
it.” 

“Hmmm. At any rate, we’re hav- 
ing a problem with el Cervantes. He 
appeared to be with the Plan from 
the beginning, but lately — well, the 
details aren’t important.” 

“He’s having doubts?” 
“Perhaps worse than that. El 
Alvarez suspects treachery.” 

“Does el Cervantes have a con- 
veniently aged son?” 

“Unfortunately not. He’s an old 
man — his son is almost fifty. But 
it’s a good situation. His only 
grandson is twelve years old and 
there is nobody in the family who 
can take over in the Senado should 
something happen to the son.” He 
smiled pleasantly. “They have been 
cursed with daughters.” 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT 



31 




“Then I am to challenge this 
fifty-year-old man — and kill him?” 
“Yes. It would be that simple, 
except for one thing.” Julio leaned 
back against the tree. “There’s a 
price on your life now, Ramos. In 
every Clan except Alvarez. El 
Tueme offers ten thousand for your 
head. So first — we have to change 
your head.” 

“Plastic surgery?” 

Once the scalpel touches ‘plasti- 
flesh . 

“Of course. We’ve discussed the 
possibility.” 

“Seems extreme. Could they 
change me back afterward?” 

“I don’t know. I imagine not.” 
“I don’t like it.” 

Julio shrugged. “It’s your head, 
Ramos. I’d hate to see you lose it 
out of vanity.” 

“Let me think — do you have a 
copy of the picture they’ll be using 
to identify me?” 

“Yes. Come with me.’’ The 
Commandante led Ramos past two 
sets of armed guards into the opu- 
lent house. He thumbed open the 
door to a large study. He opened a 
heavy wooden filing cabinet — also 
thumblocked. 

“Here.” 

Ramos studied the picture, a 
good likeness but evidently taken 
toward the end of his imprison- 
ment. “No problem. Look.” He 
held the picture next to his face. “I 
don’t have the prison pallor any 
more, and in this picture my face 
was puffy with bruises. If I shave 



oil niy inousliu III' iind crop my hair 
close, iioboily would recognize 
me.” 

Julio looked back and forth 
between Hie pielure and Ramos. 
“Probably. I'd be happier if you 
went ahead with (he surgery, 
though.” 

“It bothers me, Julio. I mean — I 
have so few solid links with the 
past, as it is. 1 have the feeling that 
if I lose my lace — ” 

“All right. Fine.” Julio took the 
picture back and refiled it. “Tell 
you what. I’ll have Ami bring you 
some of that lotion, what do they 
call it, that women use to darken 
their complexion.” He locked the 
drawer and took Ramos by the 
arm. “No more work tonight. Let’s 
finish that bottle of wine.” 

1 WAS waiting for Ramos when 
he returned to his quarters. 
She massaged Sol Instante into 
every square inch of his skin, and it 
did a very convincing job. Ramos 
considered the maxim that a soldier 
had best abstain from sex on the 
eve of a battle — and rejected it. 

VI 

W ITH papers and currency ap- 
propriate for a citizen of Clan 
Amarillo, Ramos had no trouble 
getting into Ceiyantes. He didn’t 
want to go directly to Clan Cervan- 
tes headquarters — instead he 
monorailed to a small town a safe 
distance from the border, then took 




32 



GALAXY 




a coach to an even smaller town, 
primitive enough not to have video 
service on their phones. 

It was a lovely little resort town, 
Lago Tuira, and he rested for a day 
and a night at the inn there. Then 
he placed an anonymous call to the 
castle guard, briefly warning the 
Clan that a hired assassin was after 
the younger Cervantes. The man he 
spoke to tried to keep him on the 
line, but he rang off, shouldered his 
knapsack and slipped out of the 
inn. 

Clan Cervantes was the oldest 
settled part of Selva and the part 
where mankind had most effective- 
ly modified the environment. The 
jungle around Lago Tuira resemb- 
led a garden gone to seed more 
than a typical Selvan jungle. The 
largest creatures there were no 
more dangerous than a Terran bear 
or large cat, and relatively rare. So 
Otto could travel through the early 
morning dark with little fear of be- 
traying his presence by laser use. 

Under cover of darkness, Ramos 
walked back down the crude rpad, 
slipping into the jungle whenever a 
vehicle appeared. Nobody seemed 
to be in any great hurry to get to 
Lago Tuira and none of the vehicles 
bore official markings. The Clan 
either hadn’t had time to trace 
back his call — or had decided it 
came from a crank. 

At dawn Ramos left the road and 
worked his way parallel to it, be- 
hind a cover of twenty or thirty 
meters of jungle. By noon he found 



a climbable tree, pitched his cam- 
ouflaged hammock in the lower 
branches and slept soundly until 
dark. Then he walked through the 
cool night until he reached the 
monorail terminal. He waited in 
the woods outside of town until a 
couple of hours after sunup, then 
walked down to the terminal, treat- 
ed himself to a shower, a change of 
clothes and a hearty meal, and then 
caught the morning train to Clan 
Cervantes. 

He had no intention of actually 
trying to maneuver Ricardo Cer- 
vantes III into a duel. But he had to 
make the appearance of setting it 
up. 

Castello Cervantes dominated 
the largest city Otto/Ramos had 
seen on Selva — it held nearly a 
quarter-million people. He decided 
a good starting point for him would 
be to try to land some sort of job in 
the castle itself. 

Passengers leaving the monorail 
had to show their identification to a 
pair of armed soldiers, who check- 
ed their faces against a photograph. 
When Ramos’s turn came he 
managed to glimpse the picture — it 
was the one of himself he had seen 
in Julio’s study. 

“Who’s that, friend?” he asked 
one of the soldiers. 

The man looked at him coldly. 
“Just be glad it isn’t you.” 

“How long have they been doing 
this?” he asked the man in line 
next to him. 

“I don’t know,”.he said. “I come

here two or three times a week — this 
never happened before.” 

Maybe the phone call had work- 
ed. 

S ECURITY was also tight among 
the castle personnel, Ramos/ 
Otto discovered when he discreetly 
presented himself as a job appli- 
cant — the one chore that didn’t 
require security clearance was dish- 
washer, second grade. 

The next day he was in the castle 
commisary, washing pots and pans 
and keeping his ears open. By 
afternoon he had learned that 
Ricardo III was nowhere near Clan 
Cervantes. The day after the phone 
call, he had taken his physician’s 
advice and gone on a month’s 
vacation. 

Whether Ramos/Otto had pre- 
cipitated the man’s disappearance 
or not was immaterial. 'There was 
nothing to keep him in Clan 
Cervantes, so he chewed out the 
kitchen foreman and stalked away. 
He took an indirect route, through 
Clan Amarillo, to Castello Alvarez. 
He called Julio and the Comman- 
dante said to come right over, even 
though it was late. 

Bone-tired, Ramos sagged over 
to the mansion and met Julio in the 
garden. He recounted a plausible 
version of what had happened in 
Clan Cervantes. 

“. so it looks like we’ll have to 
wait, take care of him next month 
when he has to be back on the job. 
It shouldn’t be any problem.” 



Julio had been reserved, silent 
through the whole report. At this 
he nodded abruptly and said, “All 
right. We wait.” Rising: “Come 
with me, Ramos. 1 have something 
in the study that ought to interest 
you.” 

He opened the door to the study 
and ushered Ramos in. At the far 
end of the room a man sat on a 
swivel chair, reading, his back 
toward them. Julio said, “He’s 
here.” The man snapped his book 
shut; turned and stood, smiling. 

He was Ramos Guajana. 

“Who is this impostor,” Otto/ 
Ramos said, drawing his sword. 
The Commandante laughed. 

“Simply another version of your- 
self,” Guajana said, “with no in- 
convenient amnesia.” His own epee 
danced fluidly into a garde posi- 
tion. “Shall I kill him, Julio?” 

“No. El Alvarez will have ques- 
tions for him. You may hurt him, 
though. With a minimum of bleed- 
ing, please. This rug is the very 
devil to clean.” 

“It’s strange,’’ Guajana said, 
advancing. “I am almost fencing 
before a mirror. But my reflection 
has pitiably bad form.” 

Danger imminent, Otto became 
all Otto McGavin. Who hadn’t 
fenced in fifteen years. And was 
exhausted. 

Guajana took the initiative with 
an attack en cuatro and Otto 
swatted the blade away, advanced 
with a series of short jabbing 
thrusts. Guajana parried them 



34 



GALAXY 




easily, laughing, then did a simple 
cutover and pinked Otto just above 
the right knee. 

Guajana jumped back and held 
his sword up in ironic salute. “First 
blood.” 

“I think he’s good for a little 
more,” Julio said. “Try for the 
face.” 

Got to get inside his blade and 
use my hands and feet. The wound 
didn’t yet hurt much, but Otto 
could feel his leg stiffening. Blood 
was creeping toward his ankle. 

Guajana came in blade high, en 
seis, relaxed. Otto stepped for- 
ward, ducked, felt the blade graze 
his scalp, delivered a side-kick to 
Guajana’s leading shin, heard it 
break, dropped the sword and 
struck the man’s throat with 
bunched fingers (left hand) while 
seizing his sword wrist. He held the 
weapon high out of the way (decid- 
ed this instant to not use the neck- 
breaker, let him live) and punched 
him hard just below the sternum. 

He felt Julio’s forearm snake 
across his throat, dropped the 
broken Ramos, shifted weight, slid 
a foot grating down the man’s shin 
to crunch on his instep — breaking 
Julio’s hold on his throat — shifted 
weight again and spun the heavy 
man over his shoulder and stepped 
forward to deliver the final kick 
and 

saw laser pistol glint in Julio’s 
hand and 

knew he couldn’t kick it out from 
this distance and 



(wondering that he was still alive) 
stepped back, raising hands. 
“Don’t shoot. I’m through.” 
Otto heard running footsteps out- 
side the study. The leg wound hurt 
with a deep ache that he knew 
meant the large muscle was torn. 
His hair was matted with dried 
blood and he had the first intima- 
tion of a monumental headache. 

With his free hand Julio was 
feeling for Guajana’s pulse. “If 
you’ve killed him I will personally 
castrate you with a rusty knife.” He 
said this calmly, without any sign of 
hyperbole. 

Tomyour friends.” The guard 
J pushed Otto into the cell 
roughly. His injured leg gave out 
and he rolled along the damp floor. 
It smelled of old urine and mildew. 
A man stood with his back to Otto, 
staring through the barred window 
into the lighted yard. On the 
double bunk was another person, 
female, crying softly. 

Otto swore. “Is that you, Esh- 
kol?” She responded by crying 
louder. 

“That’s her.” Octavio turned 
and even in the dim light it was ob- 
vious how roughly he’d been handl- 
ed. His face was one puffy bruise, 
eyes swollen almost shut. His tunic 
was crusty with black blood. 
“What happened? How?” 

“How, we don’t know. Five or six 
men. broke into the hotel last night, 
after midnight — ” 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT

“What were you doing there? I 
told you — ” 

“I felt that Rachel needed pro- 
tection.” 

“Thanks for trying,” Otto said. 
“Go on.” 

“They disairmed me and took 
Rachel prisoner. They forced her to 
open the door to Guajana’s room. 
He didn’t seem too surprised to see 
them.” 

“Figures. What then?” 

“They bound and gagged us — 
Rachel and me — and took us down 
the trail to a helicopter. We were 
here by dawn.” 

“And they spent the rest of the 
day trying to make you talk.” 
“That’s right. But I didn’t.” 
“Obviously. You’re still alive, so 
they must have further use for you. 
Did they do the same to her?” 
“N-no,” Rachel said, quavering. 
“Tomorrow, they said.” 

“Tomorrow I’m sure it will be,” 
Otto said brusquely. “They’re go- 
ing to kill you both, anyhow. Me 
too, most likely.” 

“How can you be so sure?’’ 
Slight overtone of contempt, hard- 
ening her voice. 

Otto felt anger rising, knew it 
was a Ramos-reaction, tried to 
ignore it. 

Pause: “Think about it, lady.” 
“It seems to me,” Octavio said, 
“that they would want to take as 
little chance of angering the Con- 
federation as possible.” 

Otto shrugged and knew it was 
too dark for them to see the 



gesture. “ I'lie C'onrcderation has 
already expressed its interest by 
sending me. It will be much better 
for Alvarez, if she just disappears — 
you, too — rather than have you 
sitting around as evidence that they 
abducted what is to the Confedera- 
tion the most valuable woman on 
this planet.” 

J’But what about you — ” 

“Shut up. There’s a recorder 
somewhere taking down every word 
we’re saying. Don’t let them know 
anything they don’t already know — 
least of all, about me.” 

Octavio went to sit on the bunk 
with Rachel and Otto took over his 
place at the window. He tested the 
bars — they were solid. 

The door opened with a loud 
rattle and Otto could see, next to 
the jailer, the silhouette of a man 
carrying a laser rifle. 

“You’re next,’’ he said. 
“Colonel.” 



VII 

T i HEY knocked him around a bit 
and drugged him and then 
knocked him around some more 
but Otto, because of his condition- 
ing, could endure it dispassionate- 
ly. Finally they hurt him so badly 
that he could do the Zen trick and 
nothing could hurt him any more. 
They threatened him with a simple 
death and then with an imaginative 
one and to both he only smiled 
ple'asantly.

GALAXY 




A tiny voice that he heard only 
very infrequently — so profound was 
his conditioning — said, They really 
are going to kill you this time, 
though you might live with the right 
combination of truth and bullshit. 

Another, perhaps the rational 
voice, said. Your only chance is to 
throw in with them. 

Or perhaps the rational one was 
the voice that said. They have 
bound themselves to kill you no 
matter what you do .. 

And the trapped animal inside 
him said without words: Do any- 
thing to live. 

But all of this debate, rational to 
venal to visceral, came to nothing. 
If the next beat of his heart would 
betray the Confederation, the Thou 
shalt not . imprinted on every 
cell of his body would hold that 
organ still. 

The fourth time he fell uncons- 
cious they didn’t shock him back to 
wakefulness. 

O tto awoke in a white room, in 
bed. Each arm and leg was in- 
dividually secured, but only two by 
jailer’s cuffs. His left arm and right 
leg, as well as two fingers of his 
right hand, were immobilized in 
orthopedic tractors — he remember- 
ed when the fingers and leg had 
been broken, but the other must 
have been snapped while he was 
unconscious. 

His tongue counted seven teeth 
missing. Four had been extracted 
with pliers, the balance with a 



truncheon. Amateurs. He knew at 
least eleven ways to cause greater 
pain without leaving any mark. He 
toyed with the fantasy of demon- 
strating his skills on the men who 
had interrogated him. Woozy with 
anesthetic and fatigue — and having 
no real reason to stay awake — he 
carried that fantasy with him into 
darkness. 

When he came to the second 
time a man in a white tunic was 
withdrawing a hypodermic gun 
from his arm and in a fraction of a 
second all the pains came back in 
one electrifying spasm. He fought it 
and then bent with it and then was 
above it — the pain was there but it 
was only a testimony that he still 
lived. 

“Gul’ morzhling, Dogther,” he 
said and then adjusted to the indig- 
nities inside and around his mouth: 
“Good morning. Doctor.’’ 

The man just looked over his 
head and wrote something down on 
a clipboard. Then he walked out of 
Otto’s field of view and said, “Go 
ahead.” 

Julio Rubirez came in with a 
chair and sat down at the foot of 
Otto’s bed. “Commandante,” Otto 
said. 

Rubirez regarded him for long 
seconds. “I can’t decide whether 
you are the best-trained soldier I 
have ever seen or simply not 
human.” 

“I bleed.” 

“Perhaps the Confederation can 
make robots that bleed.” 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT

“You won’t find out from me.’’ 
“Not by torture, granted.’’ He 
stood up and, holding on to the 
bedrail with clenched fists, leaned 
closer to Otto. “You present an 
unusual problem.’’ 

“I should Kope.’’ 

“I’ve been in conference with el 
Alvarez. He has the idea that 
perhaps you can be convinced of 
the value of the Plan. Perhaps not 
only tell us what we need to know, 
but even lend your talents to the 
execution of the Plan.” 

“You don’t agree.” 

“Of course not. El Alvarez is 
intelligent and dedicated but he has 
never been a soldier. He doesn’t 
know enough about pain. He will 
not believe what I tell him about 
the kind of person you must be. He 
thinks he can reach you.” 

“He may be right.” 

Julio smiled wanly. “Name a 
price.” 

He thought. “I have been — what 
I am—” 

“You can say ‘prime operator.’ 
Some things we do know.” 

“ — a prime operator, then, near- 
ly half my life. I’ve been shot and 
knifed and burned and, in general, 
have been treated poorly so many 
different ways and times that I’ll 
have to admit that in a way you’re 
right. I have no illusions left and 
few emotions.” 

Otto smiled and knew how ugly 
the gesture looked. “But I was 
really sentimental about my left 
upper molar; it was the only real 



tooth I had left. So, a deal: if you 
bring that man here who pried my 
tooth out and cut his throat in front 
of me, I might talk business.” 

“Do you know which one he 
was?” 

“No.” 

“Very well. Orderly!” A young 
man jogged over, snapped to 
attention. “Bring me Tenientes 
Yerma and Casona. And a sharp 
knife — ” He thought. “Detail your- 
self a squad and bring them 
bound.” 

“Sir.” Click, about-face, jog. 
“You’re serious,” Otto said. 
“About killing them, yes. As to 
influencing you, I suspect it will 
not, but — I promised el Alvarez I 
would try. Besides, both of them 
disgust me. They are mariposas, 
the dear boys. And they enjoy other 
people’s pain too much.” 

You hate to see that part of your- 
self reflected, Otto thought. “If you 
know that I’m a prime operator, 
then you must know what kind of 
trouble will follow from killing 
me.” 

“It’s a calculated risk.” 

“An easy calculation to make. 
Killing me is an extravagant ges- 
ture, rather like assassinating an 
ambassador. And you’re going to 
do that, too.” 

“Probably.” 

“The very least that will happen 
is brainwipe for el Alvarez and you 
and everyone else of high rank. 
And if you drop one bomb on 
Grunwelt, you’ve forfeited the des- 



38 



GALAXY 




tiny of your whole planet. You 
know about October.” 

“It’s a myth.” 

“It is not. I’ve been there.” 
“Really.” He sat down again, 
propping his chin on a cupped 
palm. “Did you find it amusing? 
Instructive?” 

“You might find it instructive. 
No form of animal life more com- 
plex than a cockroach survived. 
The cockroaches have become very 
large and aggressive.” 

“You’re saying that the Confed- 
eration would be so outraged over 
our killing a very few people that 
they would murder an entire plan- 
et.” He laughed. The sound had a 
forced quality. 

‘‘The Confederation doesn’t 
murder.” Oh really? “They releas- 
ed a virus into October’s atmo- 
sphere that sterilized every female, 
from fish to mammal.” 

“So they only murdered the ones 
who lived long enough to starve.” 
‘‘They supplied food. As a 
gesture. Men can live on plants and 
bugs.” 

Julio yawned. “I wouldn’t mind 
being sterile. Three children are 
sufficient.” 

“Don’t be stupid.” 

Julio smiled. “Don’t be insult- 
ing.” 

They sat silently for a minute. 
“When do I see el Alvarez?” 

“He is very busy. You may see 
him before you die.” 

“You have a very primitive sense 
of theater, Julio.” 



“True.” He laughed. “But a 
captured audience.” 

T i HE orderly returned with six 
armed men and the two inter- 
rogators, their arms tied behind 
their backs. The two tenientes led 
the procession, erect but very pale. 

The orderly handed Julio a 
thick-bladed butcher’s knife. 
“Good morning, Bernal. Romulo.” 
He slapped the handle in his palm, 
rhythmically. 

One answered weakly; the other 
opened his mouth and his teeth 
chattered. 

“Which of you pulled this gentle- 
man’s teeth? It would please him to 
see your throat cut.” 

“I would be satisfied,” Otto said, 
“to see them lose a few teeth them- 
selves.” 

The one w'ho had spoken earlier 
said, “We both did, Comman- 
dante.” 

“Hmm.” Julio looked thought- 
ful. “Orderly — see if there are 
pliers in that desk over there.” 

He returned with a chromed 
surgical instrument that looked as 
if it might do the job. “Will this do, 
Commandante?” 

“We can only try. Romulo, you 
may test the equipment on Ber- 
nal.” He gestured to the orderly. 
“Untie him.” 

The interrogator took the tool 
and faced his partner, talked to 
him the way one talks to a child. 
“Open your mouth, Bernal.” And 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT 



39 




whispering: “Be brave.” 

Bernal gave one small cry of pain 
when the first tooth came out. 
Romulo looked at Rubirez, who 
nodded, and bent to take out 
another. 

“Well?” he s‘aid to Otto. 

“Well what?” 

“I’ve displayed my good faith. 
Now will you answer some ques- 
tions?” 

“You’ve displayed something. 
No.” 

He nodded, blankly. “Orderly. 
Call the prison compound and tell 
them 1 want de Sanchez and the 
woman Eshkol.” 

Bernal was losing his third tooth, 
not making a sound although tears 
coursed down his face. Rubirez 
said, “Oh, Romulo — ” 

The man looked up and didn’t 
even have time to blink. The 
butcher knife hit with enough force 
to cut his neck half through. The 
soldiers and Otto flinched at the 
sudden spray of blood. Rubirez 
snatched the dying man by the hair 
and jerked him down, then hacked 
savagely twice, then gave a third 
studied blow that separated the 
head from the body. He held it 
dripping over Otto’s bed. 

“One more?” There was abso- 
lutely no expression on his face; no 
emotion in his voice. 

Otto choked back sudden bile. 
“No. That was an adequate dem- 
onstration — of — ”• 

“My primitive sense of theater?” 
One of the soldiers ran for the door. 



“Private Rivera. Come back or you 
will be punished.’’ The private 
slowed for a second and ran on. 
The Commandante returned his 
gaze to Olio, but didn’t say 
anything. The only sounds were the 
private’s echoing footsteps and a 
faint rustling that Otto knew was 
the headless body, moving. Bernal 
fainted. 

“You may all leave. Take this 
garbage with you.” 

A DEAD man is much heavier than 
a live one. It took only one 
man to carry the unconscious 
Bernal, four to drag out the body. 
The orderly carried the dullstaring 
head to the door, set it outside and 
posted himself. 

“Now, Colonel. Shall we try to 
get down to business again?” 

“If you think you’ve impressed 
me, you’re wrong. I’ve known many 
ruthless men.” 

The Commandante moved to the 
side of Otto’s bed and laid the point 
of the knife against his throat. 
Blood still dripped from the blade 
and his right arm was hot crimson 
from the hand to the elbow. 

“I’m getting tired of your ma- 
chismo, Colonel.” Otto could move 
his head but knew it would be 
useless. 

“Really? I’m vastly entertained 
by yours.’’ The Commandante, 
livid, jerked the knife away. Having 
lived to see that expression on 
Julio’s face, Otto knew he would 
live as long as el Alvarez ordered it.

GALAXY 




The orderly escorted Rachel 
-Eshkol and Octavio de Sanchez 
into the room, then returned to his 
post at the doorway. Rachel was 
white-faced but composed; Otto 
assumed that the head had been 
removed from the corridor. Both of 
the prisoners were clad in baggy 
gray fatigues and had their hands 
tied behind their backs. Octavio 
still looked used, but Rachel hadn’t 
yet been harmed. She gasped when 
she saw Otto. 

“I wanted the two of you to see 
what we’ve done to your prime 
operator,” the Commandante said, 
“so you won’t have any illusions 
about your own diplomatic immun- 
ity.” 

“I haven’t doubted for a second 
that you can kill us,” Eshkol said 
through clenched teeth. 

“You are all so full of heroism,” 
Julio said, fingering the edge of the 
bloody knife. The woman saw it for 
the first time and stifled a scream. 
“So little perturbed at the prospect 
of — ” 

“What has he been doing to 
you?” She stared at the blood spat- 
tered on Otto’s bedclothes. 

“Nothing to him, young lady,” 
the Commandante said. “He asked 
for a man’s life and 1 gave it to 
him.” 

“Is that true?” she asked Otto. 

“No.” 

“But it is,” said Julio. 

“You two could get along very 
well together,” she said bitterly. 
“You are a matched set.” 



Julio laughed pleasantly. 
“Women have no appreciation for 
politics.” He addressed Octavio. 
“Isn’t that right, Teniente?” 
Octavio looked at him uncertain- 
ly. “This means — ” 

“That’s right.” Julio stepped 
behind the battered man and sawed 
through his bonds. “The masquer- 
ade is over.” He said, “Let me 
present Teniente Octavio Madero. 
He has been a good soldier under 
my command for over five years.” 
“Octavio,” Rachel said with a 
falling tone. 

“The obvious,” said Otto. “That 
clears up a few things.” 

“Indeed,” the Commandante 
said. To Eshkol: “Now you have no 
one. Your colonel is a brutal sadist 
and your confidant, a traitor. We’ll 
allow you a few days to think this 
over. While we decide what to do 
with you.” 

He called the orderly over. 
“Orderly, this man holds the same 
rank as you,” indicating Octavio, 
“but I want you to be his orderly for 
a week or so. While he recovers 
from indignities suffered for the 
good of the Plan.” Rubirez glared 
at Otto. “And in spite of your 
ministrations, I have back my 
trusted Ramos Guajana. His re- 
covery saved you from a most vile 
death.” 

Julio dismissed Octavio and the 
orderly with a wave of his hand . He 
took Eshkol’s shoulder and gently 
pushed her toward the door. 

“After you, my dear.” 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT 



41 




VIII 

M edicine on Selva was only 
about a half-century out of 
date; in four days Otto was able to 
walk with little difficulty and his 
fingers and arm were knitted. As a 
sign of his continuing clinical pro- 
gress they put him back in the jail. 

It was a different cell. There was 
no window and the door was a solid 
sheet of thick steel that slid silently 
on hidden bearings. Indirect light- 
ing and freshly stuccoed walls. The 
only smell was a faint memory of 
disinfectant. There was a tidy 
commode in one corner, next to a 
basin. The double bunk was smooth 
plastic with fresh linens; Rachel 
Eshkol lay on the bottom bunk, 
studying the underside of the top 
one. She didn’t make any sign of 
noticing .as the door slid shut 
behind Otto and locked with a 
heavy click. 

“Our quarters have improved,” 
he said. 

“Have they treated you well?” he 
said. 

“I know you detest me,” he said. 
She continued to stare straight 
ahead and Otto crossed the room, 
tested out the water faucets. 

“Which one are you?” she 
asked. 

“All Otto McGavin. I haven’t 
seen Guajana since they started 
torturing me. The overlay can’t 
have worn off so soon — it’s never 
happened before, but evidently 
there’s an escape reaction. Since 



the overlay no longer functions — ” 
“If you’re that one,” she said, 
still not looking at him, “tell me 
what was the first thing you did 
when I turned on the lights in your 
room at the Vista Hermosa.” 

He thought. “I checked the 
swords on the wall.” 

“All right.” She swung slowly to 
a sitting position and looked direct- 
ly at him. “Yes, our quarters have 
improved and no, they haven’t 
treated me well. And I can’t detest 
you very much any more because 
there are too many others. Myself. 
Rubirez. Others.” 

Otto sat down on the commode 
and started to say something. 

Rachel spoke first. “I hate 
myself for what I’ve done to the 
Confederation and to this beautiful 
planet and even to you. In my ig- 
norance I betrayed the Confedera- 
tion and doomed this planet to the 
fate of October. And brought about 
your death — I’m sorry.” All this in 
a calm monotone. 

“I’m not yet dead.” The words 
sounded false to him. 

“Yes, you are. So am I. We walk 
and talk and yet we are dead and 
already starting to rot.” 

She had the helpless, dull look of 
a mortally injured animal, but 
there was no mark on her. “What 
have they done to you?” he asked 
gently, thinking he knew. 

“Really,” she said, standing 
slowly, steadying herself with a 
hand on the upper bunk, “it’s not 
important.” She pulled the draw- 



42 



GALAXY 




string on her trousers and they rus- 
tled down her flanks. With surpris- 
ingly nimble fingers she undid the 
snaps of her tunic and shrugged it 
off, then stepped out of the 
trousers. There was a little spark of 
defiance in the way she faced Otto; 
legs apart, fists clenched at her 
sides — her body was as perfect in 
shape and tonus as Otto had 
imagined it, but from ankles to 
shoulders was a mottled pattern of 
violets and blues and browns; 
hardly a square centimeter of her 
skin, where it had been covered by 
clothing, was not bruised. She 
turned to show Otto that they had 
done the same on her back and 
buttocks and the backs of her legs; 
all except for an exact area over 
each kidney. They hadn’t wanted to 
kill her. 

“Every day. Sometimes three or 
four times.” Her voice cracked and 
she folded her arms on the upper 
bunk and buried her face but 
didn’t cry. “Rubirez and that — Oc- 
tavio man or Guajana — ” Otto 
crossed and picked up her tunic 
and tried to drape it over her shoul- 
ders, but it wouldn’t stay, so one at 
a time he took her hands and 
guided them into the sleeves of the 
tunic. She sat heavily on the bed 
and winced, then folded her hands 
in her lap and slumped, staring at 
the floor. She continued: “They — 
they put handcuffs on my wrists 
and—” 

"Please,” Otto said. “Don’t talk 
about it.” He stooped and picked 



up the gray trousers. “Take these 
and — ” 

T he door slid open and Rachel 
tried to cover herself with her 
hands. 

“Well, well,’’ said the jailer. 
“You two didn’t waste any time.” 
Otto was halfway to him when he 
saw the pistol and halted. “I’d 
think she would’ve had enough of 
that.” The man threw a bundle of 
white clothing at Otto. “Put on 
these, both of you. Now.” 

Otto separated the smaller items 
and gave them to Rachel. She 
turned her back to the jailer and 
dressed. Otto stood as close to the 
jailer as he thought prudent and 
threw his old tunic and trousers at 
him as he took them off. The jailer 
jeered and made some pointed 
remarks about Otto’s physiology. 

The jailer gathered up the gray 
clothing. “You’re going to have 
visitors soon. Try to behave until 
then.” 

They sat on the bed together. 
Otto almost reached out to pat her 
hand, didn’t. 

“They’ve never given me a white 
outfit before,” she said. “Maybe 
this is the way they dress you for 
public execution. In a way I hope 
so.” 

Otto knew that if they were going 
to be executed the executions would 
be private affairs. 

They sat for what seemed like a 
long time, neither wanting to talk, 
lost in private thought. Otto won-

dered, not for the first time, where 
along the line he had lost the fear of 
death — the respect for death. Was 
it just part of his conditioning? 
That would seem anti-survival and 
prime operators were too valuable 
to the TBII for them to program 
out the will to live. Maybe it was 
simply that familiarity bred con- 
tempt. 

With some effort of will he 
thought back to his youth and 
childhood, trying to recall some 
incident, some bit of knowledge or 
disillusionment that eventually led 
to the invisible army he had joined; 
that led to this jungle planet and 
sharing a white mausoleum with — 
he analyzed the brittle affection he 
felt for Rachel Eshkol and knew 
pretty exactly which part of it was 
sexual and which the somatic sym- 
pathy of one injured body toward 
another; which part was atonement 
for the way he had acted as Ramos 
and which was retroactive yearning 
for other women he had loved or 
once had thought he loved. And 
some dark growling part of what he 
now felt was probably the cornered 
beast’s obeying the instinct to take 
one more chance on the procreative 
raffle before it was too late. He re- 
membered a boy named Otto 
McGavin at temple trying his best 
to meditate while the acrid incense 
tried to tickle him into sneezing 
and what a hell of an Anglo- 
Buddhist he had turned out to be, 
killed for a living and facing death 
with no desire for spiritual prepara- 



tion beforehand — or was that what 
he was doing? No. What Otto was 
doing expressed the closest thing to 
a panic reaction he ever permitted 
himself. 

At age twenty Otto had enter- 
tained a conceit about “dying 
well.” He tried to remember how 
that felt. 

T he door slid open and nine 
people came in, in file. The first 
was Julio Rubirez. The next was an 
old man. Then Ramos Guajana, 
followed by a squad of six soldiers. 
Everybody was armed except the 
old man and one of the soldiers, 
whom Otto recognized as Private 
Rivera, the boy who had run from 
Rubirez’s grisly demonstration. Be- 
hind a transparent dressing on the 
side of his head was a fresh stump 
where his right ear had been. 

The old man looked familiar and 
Otto remembered who he was just 
before Rubirez introduced him. 

“El Alvarez wants a word with 
you two.” Julio turned to the old 
man. “One last time, sir. This man 
is the most dangerous, desper — ” 
“Enough, Julio. Just leave me 
your pistol.” 

Julio handed over the gun. “At 
least let me handcuff them.” 

The old man nodded. Rubirez 
handcuffed Otto's right wrist to 
Rachel’s left. Then everybody ex- 
cept el Alvarez filed out and the 
door clicked shut behind them. 

El Alvarez looked around, decid- 
ed against the indignity of sitting

on the toilet and stood opposite the 
two, leaning against the wall, the 
pistol pointed loosely in their 
direction. 

“I asked twenty-some years ago 
that this cell be built. It is the only 
cell in the complex that has no 
cameras and no microphones hid- 
den in it.” 

“Or had none twenty years ago,” 
Otto said. 

El Alvarez shook his head. “I 
had a trusted person go over it 
thoroughly last week.” 

“You have things to tell us,” 
Rachel asked, “that you don’t wish 
known by your own espionage 
people?” 

The old man didn’t answer 
directly. “How many people on 
Selva do you think know about the 
Plan?” 

“That would be hard to say,” 
Rachel answered. “Everybody 
seems to have heard rumors.” 

El Alvarez nodded and smiled. 
“That’s part of the Plan itself. 
Actually I suppose only one out of a 
hundred or so Selvans knows there 
is a truly concrete Plan. Most of 
them belong to Clan Alvarez or are 
powerful members of their own 
clans. We haven’t yet made a 
public statement about the Plan 
because we don’t want to encourage 
responsible public debate.” He 
paused expectantly, but neither 
Otto nor the girl said anything. 

“I believe your Confederation 
doesn’t think it could possibly 
work.” 



“That’s—” 

“Quiet!” Otto snapped. 

“I’ve read your orders. Colonel,” 
Alvarez said wearily. “The ones 
that were in Ambassador Eshkol’s 
safe. In that regard you have no 
secrets to protect. 

“At any rate, the Confederation 
is quite right. Oh, we could deliver 
a few bombs to Grunwelt — we 
could destroy a few cities and 
millions of people, perhaps. But I 
know and you know that war is 
more than just piracy on a large 
scale, which is what the Plan distills 
to. We simply don’t have the 
economic resources, not by a factor 
of a thousand, to maintain a war 
with Grunwelt — even if the Con- 
federation were not to intervene. 
We could start a war, but Grunwelt 
would finish it at its leisure.” 

“I don’t see why you’re telling us 
all this,” Otto said. 

“It will become clear.” 



thing that is clear — ” 
\^scorn was creeping into 
Otto’s voice — “is that our analysts 
were right. You’re willing to gamb- 
le the destiny of an entire planet in 
some convoluted scheme to get 
more power.” 

“No. If I enjoyed the exercise of 
power I would seek to preserve the 
status quo. No one on this planet is 
more powerful than I am. Except 
perhaps you two. Which is why I’ve 
brought you here, of course.” 

“You haven’t gone out of your

way to make us sympathetic,” 
Rachel said and Otto knew her just 
well enough to detect the leading 
edge of hysteria. 

“I will need your help,” el. 
Alvarez said, “the Confederation’s 
help. But first*! need your under- 
standing.” He looked at Rachel. 
“Not your sympathy.” 

“The Confederation does not 
meddle in the internal affairs of its 
member worlds,” said Otto. “Ex- 
cept when those affairs — ” 

“I know,” el Alvarez interrupted. 
“I may know the Charter even 
better than you do. Briefly; what we 
call ‘the Plan’ is only one part of a 
larger scheme. You are also part of 
that. It was laid out in some detail 
by my great-grandfather over a 
century ago. Juan Alvarez the 
Second, a political scientist and — a 
visionary. A practical man, but a 
dreamer. 

“Selva was colonized by dream- 
ers, you know. Political exiles from 
Terra who brought with them an 
idealistic form of communism. It 
didn’t last ten years — they hadn’t 
been properly prepared for survival 
here. 

“Five strong men took over and 
actually, I suppose, saved the 
colony from extinction. But these 
five governed in a brutal, arbitrary 
way. When their heirs succeeded 
they didn’t change methods — in a 
crude way, this is how the balance 
of power was preserved. People who 
rebelled were either killed or, if 
they were strong, braved the out- 



side and took other rebels with 
them and established rival clans. 
Eventually the brutality and capri- 
ciousness became institutionalized 
and, inevitably I suppose, filtered 
into the conduct of daily life at 
every level. Do people routinely 
settle arguments by dueling on any 
other planet?” 

“I don’t think so,” Rachel said. 
“No,” Otto said. 

“That’s one example. There are 
others. The sum of it, though, is 
that our way of life is in almost 
every respect a healthy millennium 
behind that of any other culture in 
the Confederation.” 

“I quite agree,” Otto said sourly. 
“And it has a built-in stability 
through the method of succession.” 
He seemed now to be pleading 
rather than explaining. “But Juan 
Alvarez II devised a way to subvert 
that stability.” 

“And to implement this you need 
help from the Confederation?” 
“That’s rig'ht. We—” 
“Weapons? Money?” As if I 
were in a position to make prom- 
ises, Otto thought. 

“No — well, a little money, may- 
be. Let me explain. Juan Alvarez 
the Second suggested that we need 
set up only a few initial conditions, 
not obviously revolutionary 
changes, in order to shift the base 
of power gradually away from the 
clan leaders, eventually transform 
them into powerless figureheads.” 
“What could you possibly have 
to gain by all this?” Rachel asked.

^^■wrou would have to be in my 
Xposition truly to understand. 
Most Selvans are reasonably con- 
tent with their lives because they 
know no better — their educations 
and the information they receive 
about other worlds are carefully 
controlled. I was educated off- 
world — as part of Juan the Second’s 
Plan — and I feel, have always felt, 
dissatisfied. Every bit as manipu- 
lated — and helpless — as are my 
subjects. That I am ruled by a half- 
a-thousand dead men, rather than 
one live one, makes no difference.” 

“Very poetic,” Otto said. “Spe- 
cifically. What initial conditions?” 

“These will be disguised by our 
preparations for the hypothetical 
war. Clan Diaz is building a fleet of 
Foster-type freighters. We are call- 
ing them bombers.” Otto vaguely 
remembered that a Foster drive was 
a reaction jet powered by fusion of 
deuterium. Ancient history. “Un- 
fortunately they will not be finished 
in time. To preserve the element of 
surprise, we will have to attack 
when the planets are closest — and 
the next opportunity will not be for 
five years. 

“So for the next five years we will 
have a fleet of new ships and it will 
not be unreasonable to suggest we 
make some money with them. Such 
commerce as goes on between Selva 
and her sister planet is almost 
totally controlled by Grunweltische 
shipping and tourist firms — we can 
underbid them and still make a 
good profit.” 



“I begin to see,” Otto said. 

“See what?” Rachel asked. 

Alvarez made an animated ges- 
ture, forgetting the gun in his 
hand — Otto ducked instinctively. 
“This way we will have formed a 
new social class of interplanetary 
merchants — who will be the only 
ones with access to wealth outside 
of our own closed economic system! 
Each clan will see the fortune to be 
made and none will be able to 
afford not to — ” 

“Wait, wait,” Otto said. “I see 
something else. The closest thing to 
a spaceport on this planet is barra 
de Alvarez.” 

“That’s right,” Alvarez said im- 
patiently. 

“So you will be getting first crack 
at the money — tarriffs, docking 
fees—” 

“No, no — that’s part of the plan, 
too. I will be in a position to 
encourage interplanetary trade by 
taking as little — ” 

“As little as you could and not 
appear suspicious,” Otto said 
blandly. 

“That’s correct,” he said with 
flinty pride. 

“I’m no sociologist,” Otto said. 
“And when I studied interplanetary 
economics ... 1 don’t remember 
learning about anything one-tenth 
this bizarre. It’s about the shakiest 
recipe for social reform I’ve ever 
heard.” 

“I know my people.” 

“And what do you need from the 
Confederation?” 



THE ONLY WAR WE’VE GOT 



47 




“Mostly advice. And that they 
not react too quickly if they hear 
rumors of war. As you say, Colonel, 
you’re not a sociologist, but I’m 
sure the Confederation has many 
good people who are. And econo- 
mists and proipagandists and psy- 
chodynamicists-and — whatever. 
People who could review Juan 
Alvarez’s plan, update it and insure 
that it would work.” 

Otto shook his head. “That 
sounds contrary to the policy of self- 
determination.” 

“Your presence here implies that 
the policy is flexible. Colonel.” El 
Alvarez smiled. “Besides, the Plan 
is home-grown. We would only 
want the Confederation to help us 
polish it, as I say.” 

Rachel asked, “Are you saying 
that the clan leaders would even- 
tually become dependent on the 
new merchant class and then be 
ruled by it? Even though the mer- 
chant class would have only eco- 
nomic power?” 

“Yes. Again — I know my 
people.” 

“Your people,’’ she said, her 
voice starting to shake, “I don’t 
think are subtle enough to respond 
to that kind of pressure.’’ She 
pulled the hem of her blouse up a 
few centimeters, showing the 
bruises. “Your people abused me 
several times a day and beat me 
without mercy — just for amuse- 
ment; no pretense of interrogation. 
I think you are overrating Selva if 
you think it will be ready for civili- 



zation within the next few hundred 
years.” 

“I’m sorry. More, I am outrag- 
ed. But please try to understand — ” 
“I think I understand more than 
either of you do.” 

“No, I mean — you couldn’t be 
protected. Nor you. Colonel. I am 
surrounded by suspicious men 
and—” 

H e was interrupted by the 
door’s sliding open. Julio Rub- 
irez walked in, leading the whole 
entourage, guns ready. 

“I didn’t summon you,’’ el 
Alvarez said. 

“But you did, sir.” Ironic em- 
phasis on the “sir.” Julio scraped a 
place on the wall with his thumb- 
nail; thin stucco flaked off, reveal- 
ing a metal microphone plate. 
“Drop that pistol, whoever you 
are.” 

El Alvarez gauged the faces of 
the men covering him and dropped 
the gun. 

“This man is an imposter,” Julio 
said to the soldiers. “As good a 
copy of our beloved Alvarez as the 
man on the bunk is of Teniente 
Guajana.” 

Guajana picked up Alvarez’s 
pistol and handed it to one of the 
soldiers. 

“I promise I will find out what he 
has done with our leader.” 

The soldier to whom Guajana 
had given the pistol was already 
holding a rifle with both hands. He 
found it awkward and, not think-

ing, passed the pistol to the only 
man in the squad who had a free 
hand; Private Rivera. 

“And as for these two — ” Julio 
leered at Otto and Rachel and 
raised his gun. 

Private Rivera slipped the safety 
off the pistol, held it to the back of 
the Commandante’s head, and 
fired. Julio was still smiling as his 
dead body pitched forward. 

Otto hit the floor, taking Rachel 
with him, and scooped up the 
Commandante’s pistol with his left 
hand. Guajana had just unholster- 
ed his own gun and was about to 
shoot Private Rivera pointblank 
when Otto fired and opened up the 
nearside of his likeness from hip to 
ear. 

“Drop it drop it!” Otto yelled 
and all of the soldiers except Rivera 
dropped weapons mostly still on 
safeties. 

“You too. Private Rivera,” Otto 
said quietly. 

Rivera let the pistol slip from his 
fingers and raised his hand to touch 
the stub of his ear. 

“I’m confused,” he said. “What 
happened?” 

“The first shots of a war,” Otto 
said. “And maybe the last.”

C HRISTMAS stories in the store windows 
at Christmas to put the inside outside 
and the outside inside. I fancied myself in 
one of the dolls once— a skating scene, all 
snow and tinsel, a Regency ballroom’s 
miniature chandeliers and snowlike mir- 
rors— but if I had changed places with my 
doll, her oval neck, her pretty, flushed face, 
her fan, I would have found myself not 
enchanted and not in the woods, but stuck 
into the refuse of a painted stage, with 
lights in my eyes and nails driven into my 
waist, with the too-large wooden head of 
another doll, quite coarse and dead, next to 
mine. (To go inside while still remaining on 
the outside!) So I hopped out of the window 
as quickly as I could and ran down Fifth 
Avenue like the Pudding Boy on little 
wooden feet, leaving behind an umbilicus of 
protoplasm stretching back into the win- 
dow. 

‘Oh, the maddening whiff I had of those 
huge, God-tormented, driven creatures with 
their passions and their fiesh and their 
appetites and their eye-sockets! You can't 
even tell where they end; their skin is wet 
and it sheds. They look like dolls without 
even trying. I was brought back at once, of 
course. So I put myself into a tolerable

was what we must look like to a doll inside a

Oh, wouldn’t I like to be you\ she said. 

Oh, wouldn't I like to be you! I said. 

Not if you knew, we both said. 

I think we had actually worked something 
out by the day before New Year’s; at least 
our signals had become more humanized: 
but she was dismantled on December 30 
and I never saw her again. Borne away 
shrugging cynically: “Dull, dull, dull!" 

Or was she crying? I hope, of course, that 
she is being kept for another year, wrapped 
up safely and luxuriously, etcetera. The 
sweet smell of a lumber room. DiiPaming 
and drowsing, my other small self, in the 
gloaming. 

We might have done it, even so; we might 
have made the exchange without bashing 
our heads against the glass: she through 
the fish-tank of a window, misted over with 
the cold, our huge, watery eyes, our 
swimming fur hats, myself into the enchant-

made of tears. To put all one’s energies into 
the trembling interface between appearance 
and appearance, to look back at that single, 
thin, conscious thread hanging between 
oneself and the disk of a stranger’s face

\ riviD pictures oscillated across 
Martin’s mental screens: 

He was a warm pearl in a giant 
oyster. The oyster was squeezing 
him to death with dank passion . 

He was in the last crushing 
seconds of foetal agony. Damn! 
Mother should never have had 
children . 

An inchworm. Inside a great pea. 
Bam! Cook snapped him cruelly 
from the pod . 

The last, he decided, was close 
enough to the truth. Something very 
bad had happened to the ship. 
Something fatal. The escape cap- 
sule had imploded its fleshy walls, 
formed a Martin-sized cocoon and 
ejected him from whatever catas- 
trophe lay behind. Now — 

ABLE MARTIN. 

“What?” Martin tried to move 
his head. Abruptly the walls sucked 
themselves back into place. Martin 
rose weightlessly from his form- 
couch, pulled himself back, snap- 
ped himself down. 

MARTIN. 

“Who’s that?” 

ship’s computer, martin. 

“Oh.” 

are you injured in any way? 
“No. What happened?” 

THE SHIP HAS BEEN DESTROYED. 
YOU ARE ABOARD ESCAPE CAPSULE 
FORTY-TWO. 

Martin waited for more. Evi- 
dently direct questions were re- 
quired. “Did we hit something? No, 
that’s not likely, is it? How did it 
happen? Did anybody else get off?” 



Ship’s computer was silent. 
Martin shrugged, inspected his 
surroundings. There wasn’t much 
to see. The capsule was spherical. 
Spongy amber walls. No ports. A 
single safe-light to his right. 
Maximum distance from one wall to 
another, roughly two-and-a-half 
meters. 

And he was — where? Deep space. 
Between Wolfs Star and Jefferson. 
But that didn’t mean a thing, really. 
He knew that much. The ship had 
been in Warp when whatever 
happened had happened — it could 
have been tossed into reality nearly 
anywhere. If he was now remotely 
near either Wolfs Star or Jefferson 
it would be a universally large co- 
incidence. 

MARTIN. 

“Right here.” 

THE SHIP WAS DESTROYED 
THROUGH A MALFUNCTION IN THE 
DAVIDSON AUXILIARY REGULA- 
TORS. ESSENTIALLY, INTERFER- 
ENCE FROM AN UNANTICIPATED 
MASS CAUSED A SUBSEQUENT MIS- 
ALIGNMENT OF THE DRIVE FIELDS, 
WHICH EJECTED THE SHIP FROM 
NONSPACE AND DESTROYED IT 
WHILE ITS WARP ENGINES WERE 
STILL PARTIALLY FUNCTIONING. 

“Oh,” said Martin. He had no 
idea what the computer was talking 
about. 

CHANCES AGAINST SUCH A MAL- 
FUNCTION ARE EIGHT TO THE TENTH 
POWER. THERE ARE NO SURVIVORS 
OTHER THAN YOURSELF. 

Martin winced at that. ‘Wobody

got out? There were two hundred 
and fifty people aboard.” 

TWO-HUNDRED-FORTY-SEVEN, 
the computer corrected, exclud- 
ing YOURSELF. WHY WERE YOU IN 
ESCAPE CAPSULE FORTY-TWO WHEN 
THE SHIP WAS DESTROYED? 

Martin was taken aback. “Huh? I 
was taking a nap. Why do you 
ask?” 

IT IS UNAUTHORIZED TO ENTER 
THE ESCAPE CAPSULE UNLESS AN 
EVACUATION ORDER HAS BEEN 
ISSUED OR ENTRY PERMISSION HAS 
BEEN GRANTED. 

“Look—” 

IF YOU WISHED TO TAKE A NAP, 
MARTIN, WHY DID YOU NOT UTILIZE 
THE BUNK IN YOUR CABIN? 

“I don’t know, I was tired. The 
capsule was handy. It seemed like a 
good idea at the time. Listen — what 
difference does it make now?” 

OCCUPYING AN ESCAPE CAPSULE 
WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION ANE^R 
RECEIPT OF AN EVACUATION ORDER 
IS A PASSENGER VIOLATION. THE 
VIOLATION WILL BE RECORDED. 

Martin laughed out loud. 

NOT UNDERSTOOD, Said the 

computer, why do you express 

DISINTEREST IN THE REPORTING OF 
THIS VIOLATION? 

“Forget it,” said Martin. He was 
getting fed up with the computer’s 
rational ramblings. And worried. 
There were things he needed to 
know. Important things. Where are 
we and where are we going? When 
does help arrive? How much air is 
aboard? Food? Water? 



H e asked the most important 
question first. The answer set 
his heart thumping against his 
chest. 

“That’s all? Eight days?” 
APPROXIMATELY, the Computer 
told him. 

“I don’t want approximately, I 
want exactly!”

YOU NEED NOT BE CONCERNED 
WITH OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, MAR- 
TIN. 

“No?” 

NO. THE SUPPLY IS MORE THAN 
ADEQUATE FOR THE DURATION OF 
YOUR ANIMATE PERIOD. 

Martin sat up. “My animate

back of his neck. “What’s that 
supposed to mean?” He remem- 
bered something. “Listen — you’re 
talking about putting me under —

two; ADDITIONALLY, BASIC PLAN- 
ETARY SURVIVAL GEAR IS AVAIL- 
ABLE SHOULD THE CAPSULE AND ITS 
OCCUPANT BE RELEASED IN THE 
VICINITY OF A PLANETARY BODY 
CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING HUMAN 
LIFE. THE CAPSULE IS DESIGNED TO 
ACCOMPLISH A SINGLE LANDING ON 
SUCH A BODY UNDER NORMAL 
CONDITIONS, three: THE CAP- 
SULE IS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH A 
STANDARD REIMAR SEVEN-O-TWO 
BEACON TRANSMITTING DEVICE 
(bTD), CAPABLE OF EMITTING A 
THREE-STAGE TRANSLIGHT EMER- 
GENCY SIGNAL WITH A RANGE OF 
FIVE-HUNDRED LIGHT-YEARS. THE 
BTD TRANSMITS A CONTINUOUS 
HOMING PATTERN FOR A PERIOD OF 
ONE STANDARD YEAR. 

Martin waited. The computer 
remained silent. He felt immensely 
relieved. The capsule didn’t look 
like much, but apparently there was 
more behind its fleshy walls than 
met the eye. 

“This — signal beacon,” Martin 
asked. “How long does it take to 
reach — wherever it’s going?” 

THE BTD SIGNAL IS A TIGHT-BEAM 
TRANSMISSION WHICH BOOSTS AN 
EMERGENCY ‘PULSE’ AT TRANS- 
LIGHT SPEEDS, AS I EXPLAINED. 
THE IMPULSE REACHES ITS MAXI- 
MUM RANGE OF FIVE-HUNDRED 
LIGHT-YEARS IN FOURTEEN POINT 
SEVEN MINUTES. 



Martin let out a breath. “Then 
it’s already there. Someone could 
have picked it up. They could be on 
their way now.” 

NEGATIVE, MARTIN. 

“What?” 

THEORETICALLY, YOU ARE COR- 
RECT. IF THE SIGNAL HAD BEEN 

TRANSMITTED AND RECEIVING 

DEVICES HAD BEEN WITHIN RANGE 
OF ITS IMPULSE AND A WARP SHIP 

HAD BEEN AVAILABLE AS YOU 

SAY, ‘they COULD BE ON THEIR WAY 
NOW.’ HOWEVER, ALL SUCH AS- 
SUMPTIONS ARE NECESSARILY IN- 
VALID SINCE NO SIGNAL HAS BEEN 
TRANSMITTED. 

“What?” Martin nearly leaped 
off his couch, forgetting the safety 
belt that held him in place. “Look — 
what the hell are you waiting for? 
I’ve got a hundred and ninety hours 
of breathing time, friend — plus or 
minus whatever I’m wasting jawing 
with you! Just get yourself — ” 

The computer interrupted: you 

DO NOT UNDERSTAND. I STATED 
THAT I WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE 
CERTAIN FACTS KNOWN TO YOU. 
THESE FACTS CONCERNED' THE 
CAPABILITIES OF THE ESCAPE CAP- 
SULE. ‘capability’ is defined as 
‘having the capacity or abil- 
ity.’ IN OTHER WORDS, THE ESCAPE 
CAPSULE IS EQUIPPED TO PERFORM 
ANI)bR SUPPLY THE AFOREMEN- 
TIONED SERVICES. UNDER CERTAIN 
CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE BTD SIGNAL WOULD BE 
UTILIZED. UNDER OTHER CONDI- 
TIONS, IT MIGHT BECOME EXPE- 



SURVIVAL COURSE 



55 




DIENT TO EMPLOY PLANETARY 
SURVIVAL GEAR. AS IT STANDS, 
HOWEVER, NONE OF THE EQUIP- 
MENT ANE)bR SERVICES MENTIONED 
ARE APPLICABLE TO THIS PARTICU- 
LAR SITUATIOIJ. 

Martin’s blood ran cold. Appli- 
cable? His first impulse was to 
scream at the computer and beat on 
the amber walls . What the hell did it 
care? It was content to stay where it 
was forever — an electronic half-wit 
buried in spongy bliss. Its oxygen 
supply wasn’t running out in plus- 
or-minus hours. 

Instead he brought his rapid 
breathing under control and leaned 
back on his couch. Not that the 
computer would care one way or the 
other whether he was calm or hys- 
terical. Screaming, however, was 
bound to use up an inordinate 
amount of oxygen. 

Halfwit or not, the computer was 
there and had to be dealt with. 

ooK,” Martin said easily, 
I / ‘what I think we have here is 
a communications problem.” 

I AM EXPERIENCING NO DIFFI- 
CULTY IN COMMUNICATING, MAR- 
TIN. 

“Okay. I am, though. Let’s run 
through it again. You haven’t 
activated the signal beacon. Why?” 

AS I EXPLAINED, BTD TRANS- 
MISSION IS NOT APPLICABLE IN THIS 
SITUATION. 

“Why not?” 

WHEN THE SHIP WAS DESTROYED 
IT WAS THROWN OUT OF WARP AND 



BACK INTO REALITY. I HAVE MADE 
EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO LOCATE 
OUR POSITION RELATIVE TO INHAB- 
ITED and/or recorded QUAD- 
RANTS. FROM THIS POINT IN SPACE 
NO RECOGNIZABLE CONSTELLA- 
TIONS CAN BE OBSERVED. I HAVE, 
OF COURSE, TAKEN INTO CONSIDER- 
ATION THE FACT THAT STELLAR 
PATTERNS DIFFER ACCORDING TO 

one’s position, additionally I 

HAVE MADE SPECTROSCOPIC ANAL- 
YSES IN AN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY A 
FAMILIAR CLUSTER OR UNIT. RE- 
SULTS: NEGATIVE. 

Martin’s heart sank. “In other 
words, we’re lost.” 

RELATIVE TO MY RECORDED 
KNOWLEDGE, YES. 

A thought suddenly struck him 
and he sat up straight again. He 
weighed his words carefully. “Do 
you believe your— navigational rec- 
ords are wholly complete?” 

NOT UNDERSTOOD, MARTIN. 

‘wholly complete’ in what 

SENSE? 

“In the sense that you have data 
on all planets and star-systems that 
have been discovered, all areas of 
space that have been mapped and 
explored.” 

TO A LARGE EXTENT, YES. WHEN I 
WAS ON THE SHIP NEW DATA WERE 
CONTINUOUSLY PROGRAMED INTO 
MY BANKS IN AN EFFORT TO MAIN- 
TAIN COMPLETE AND ACCURATE 
NAVIGATIONAL RECORDS. LOGI- 
CALLY, HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE 
THAT DATA EXIST THAT HAVE NOT 
BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO ME. I 



56 



GALAXY 




HAVE NO DEFINITE BASIS TO CON- 
CLUDE OTHERWISE. 

Martin took a deep breath. 
“Then — logically — a signal from 
our position could be received.” 

IT IS CONCEIVABLE. 

“Then transmit the signal,” 
Martin said firmly. “If there’s any 
chance at all — ” 

NEGATIVE, MARTIN. THE ODDS 
ARE ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH 
AGAINST RECEPTION. 

“To hell with the odds!” Martin 
struck his fist against the couch. 
“My odds are zero unless you do 
something!” 

NEGATIVE, MARTIN. I WILL NOT 
ACTIVATE THE SIGNAL BEACON. 

Martin eyed the blank walls 
narrowly. “I’m not asking — I’m 
telling you. I’m a — a human and 
I’m giving a machine an order.” 

PERHAPS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL 
IF YOU FULLY UNDERSTOOD THAT 
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 
COMPLEX COMPUTE^R SYSTEM BASED 
ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LOGIC AND A 
SIMPLE SERVING ROBOT. ALTHOUGH 
I AM RECEPTIVE TO CERTAIN 
COMMANDS, I AM NOT PROGRAMED 
TO OBEY YOU BLINDLY UNDER ALL 
CIRCUMSTANCES. MY BASIC FUNC- 
TION IS TO INITIATE LOGICAL 
ACTIONS BASED UPON AVAILABLE 
DATA. WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT 
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT A 
SIGNAL BEAMED FROM THIS POSI- 
TION MIGHT BE RECEIVED THE 

ODDS AS I EXPLAINED ARE 

OVERWHELMINGLY NEGATIVE. AC- 
TIVATING THE SIGNAL WOULD 



INVOLVE THE DISSIPATION OF AN 
IMMENSE AMOUNT OF ENERGY. 
CONSIDERING THE ODDS, SUCH AN 
EXPENDITURE WOULD BE UNNECES- 
SARILY WASTEFUL. 

Martin dropped his head to the 
couch. “Look,” he said wearily, 
“what am I going to do with all that 
immense amount of energy when 
I’m dead eight days from now? Will 
you explain that to me. Please?” 

H e let out a deep breath and 
looked at the amber walls. 
“Listen, 1 said a minute ago we had 
a communications problem. No. I 
do. You know my name, so you also 
probably know from the passenger 
roster what I do. I’m a heavy-equip- 
ment salesman. I sell things to 
people who want to dig up moun- 
tains and build bridges. All of our 
stuff is fully automatic — you can 
program it to do anything you want 
it to do. Only, that’s not my end of 
the business. I know how to stick the 
tape in — period. What I’m saying 
is. I’m not used to talking to 
computers. I simply don’t under- 
stand why it seems — and I’m not 
saying it’s true — but it seems as if 
you’re not making every effort to get 
me back to civilization before my air 
runs out.” Martin shook his head. 
“I don’t understand that. If you’re 
not going to activate the signal — 
what are you going to do?” 

An idea suddenly occurred to 
him. “A minute ago you said 
something about how I wouldn’t 
need all the oxygen on board. That 



SURVIVAL COURSE 



57 




it would be — what? ‘Adequate for 
my animate period?’ Is that what 
you’ve got in mind — putting me in 
some kind of deepsleep or some- 
thing? We didn’t get back to that.” 

YOU MISUNDERSTOOD, MARTIN. 
THE WORD ‘animate’ IN THE SENSE 
IT WAS USED, CAN BE DEFINED AS 

‘possessing life,’ or ‘living.’ 

WHAT I SAID WAS THAT ‘tHE SUPPLY 
IS MORE THAN ADEQUATE FOR THE 
DURATION OF YOUR ANIMATE 
PERIOD.’ BY THAT I MEANT THAT 
PRIOR TO THE TIME WHEN YOUR 
AVAILABLE OXYGEN SUPPLY WOULD 
ORDINARILY BE CONSUMED YOU 
WILL BE IN AN ESSENTIALLY NON- 
LIVING STATE, AS FAR AS PERSONAL 
COGNIZANCE IS CONCERNED. 

Martin felt something terrible 
clutch at his stomach. ‘‘For God’s 
sake — what are you talking about? 
What are you going to do to me?” 

I ASKED EARLIER THAT YOU 
ALLOW ME TO PRESENT CERTAIN 
FACTS. YOU HAVE, HOWEVER, 
FREQUENTLY ALLOWED YOUR EMO- 
TIONS — 

“Damn you!” Martin shouted. 
“I’m alive! I’m supposed to have 
emotions!” 

ASSUREDLY. AS I STATED, THE 
STANDARD ESCAPE POD, MOBILE 
(SEPM), has certain CAPABIL- 
ITIES. I ALSO ATTEMPTED TO 
EXPLAIN THAT WHILE THE SEPM’s 
PRIMARY FUNCTION IS TO TRANS- 
PORT HUMAN SURVIVORS TO SAFE- 
TY, IF POSSIBLE, THERE ARE 
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH 

“Listen,” said Martin, “I don’t 



want to hear any of that again.” 

UNDER WHICH THIS FUNCTION 

IS NO LONGER RELEVANT. EX- 
AMPLES: WHEN NO PLANETARY 
BODY CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING 
LIFE IS PRESENT WITHIN THE OPER- 
ATIONAL SPHERE OF THE CAP- 
SULE . WHEN THE ODDS AGAINST 
RECEPTION OF A BTD SIGNAL BEAM 
ARE ASTRONOMICAL. I ALSO EX- 
PLAINED THAT, WHILE I AM RECEP- 
TIVE TO CERTAIN COMMANDS UN- 
DER SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, I AM 
NOT PROGRAMED TO OBEY ALL IN- 
STRUCTIONS. PRESENT CONDITIONS 
ARE SUCH THAT I HAVE OVER- 
RIDDEN ALL BUT MY PRIMARY PRO- 
GRAMING. I AM INITIATING A 
SECONDARY LOGICAL ACTION 
BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA. I WILL 
EXERCISE THE STELLAR OUTREACH 
OPTION IN EXACTLY FORTY-FIVE 
STANDARD MINUTES.” 

Martin stared dumbly. “You’ll 
what? I don’t have any idea what 
you’re talking about.” 

IT IS QUITE PAINLESS, MARTIN. 
YOU WILL NOT 

“Painless!” 

YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT 
THIS ALTERNATIVE IS QUITE NECES- 
SARY. THE STELLAR OUTREACH 
OPTION IS NOT EXERCISED UNLESS 
OTHER CHOICES ARE IMPRACTICAL. 
IN THIS CASE NO OTHER OPTION IS 
OPEN. AGAIN, THE PROCEDURE IN 
NO WAY 

“Wait a minute,” Martin said 
hoarsely. He was scared, bewil- 
dered. His head throbbed. The 
whole thing was a nightmare.

GALAXY 




Only one fact was frighteningly 
clear: the computer had no inten- 
tion of trying to save his life. For 
some reason of its own it was going 
to kill him. 

Once he’d let his mind form the 
words he felt reasonably calm. And 
it was absolutely necessary for him 
to remain completely rational. His 
emotions were meaningless to the 
computer. If he was going to stay 
alive he would have to face the com- 
puter on its own ground. If he 
couldn’t fight logic with logic — he 
was dead. It was as simple as that. 
The computer couldn’t have put it 
better. 

“All right,’’ he said calmly, “tell 
me about the — Stellar Outreach 
option.” 

YOUR REASONABLE ATTITUDE IS 
ENCOURAGING, MARTIN. 

“Thanks,” Martin said dryly. 

THE STELLAR OUTREACH OPTION 
WAS PROGRAMED INTO THE BANKS 
OF EVERY ship’s COMPUTER AS AN 
ALTERNATE TO THE ESCAPE CAP- 
SULE’S PRIMARY FUNCTION. ESSEN- 
TIALLY: SURVIVORS WITH LOW 

RESCUE PROFILES SUCH AS YOUR- 
SELF, MARTIN ARE REAPPORTION- 

ED INTO THEIR CHROMOSOMAL 
COMPONENTS, ENCAPSULATED IN 
LIFEBANK DISPERSAL CARRIERS 

(ldc) and projected in a 

RANDOM PATTERN FROM THE CEN- 
TRAL POINT OF ORIGIN WHICH, OF 

COURSE, IS THE ESCAPE CAPSULE IT- 
SELF. 

Martin swallowed and stared at 
the amber wall. “But — why?” 



THE PURPOSE OF STELLAR OUT- 
REACH IS TO SPREAD THE SEED OF 
MAN. IT IS AN ENTIRELY LOGICAL 
SUB-PROGRAM. THOSE WHO CAN- 
NOT SURVIVE IN THEIR PRIMARY 
FORMS ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUN- 
ITY TO SURVIVE AS POTENTIAL LIFE- 
BANKS OF THE FUTURE. IT HAS BEEN 
THEORIZED THAT MAN MAY HAVE 
EVOLVED ON MANY PLANETS IN 
JUST THIS MANNER. AT ANY RATE, 
APPROXIMATELY ONE-HUNDRED- 
MILLION CHROMOSOMAL UNIT PACK 
SYSTEMS (cups) ARE DISPERSED 
THROUGH SPACE IN ONE-THOUSAND 
LIFEBANK DISPERSAL CARRIERS. AT 
A SPECIFIED DISTANCE FROM THE 
INITIAL DISPERAL POINT EACH LDC 
EXPLODES AND SCATTERS ITS 

CUPS THUS, GREATER SPATIAL 

DISTRIBUTION IS ACHIEVED. 



M artin was valiantly holding 
onto his reason. God help me, 
he thought grimly, if I ever get back 
to anywhere someone's going to 
hear about this . 

“You can — do all that?” He was 
curious in spite of himself. “Here — 
in this capsule?” 

THE PROCEDURE IS RELATIVELY 
SIMPLE, the computer told him. 
BASICALLY THE SUBJECT’S PHYSI- 
CAL BODY IS ” 

“I don’t want to go into that 
part,” Martin said quickly. 

THEN PERHAPS AN ANALOGY WILL 
SERVE. GENETICALLY SPEAKING, IF 
YOUR BODY WERE SUDDENLY TO 
EXPLODE EACH PARTICLE WOULD,

IN A SENSE, RETAIN ITS IDENTITY. 
THOUGH EACH, OF COURSE, WOULD 
BE NONSENTIENT, EACH WOULD 
RETAIN THE CELLULAR IDENTITY OF 
ABLE MARTIN. CURIOUSLY, I CAN 
PRESENT A SIMILAR ANALOGY USING 
MYSELF AS AN EXAMPLE. ORIGINAL- 
LY COMPUTERS WERE CONSTRUCT- 
AS SINGULAR UNITS. NOW, NEARLY 
ALL ARE ORGANIC TO THEIR 
IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT. I WAS A 
PART OF EVERY PART OF THE SHIP. 
PARTS OF ME WERE LOST WHEN THE 
SHIP WAS DESTROYED, BUT SINCE 
EACH PART IS ESSENTIALLY A PART 
OF THE WHOLE 

“Okay, I understand,” said 
Martin. “One question. Logic or no 
logic, what you’ve got in mind is to 
do me in, right?” 

IT IS A COLLOQUIALISM MEANING 
TO BRING ABOUT THE DEATH OF AN 
INDIVIDUAL. 

“Yes. That’s what it is. What it 
amounts to is you are going to take a 
human life against its will. What 
that is is murder, whether a — a per- 
son does it or a computer. You can 
look up the definition yourself. I 
don’t have any desire to be ‘nonsen- 
tient,’ friend — and I couldn’t care 
less about Spreading the Seed of 
Man. I don’t know much about 
robots and computers but I can’t 
believe you haven’t got some kind of 
built-in something or other that 
prohibits your taking a human life. 
Look that up in your banks or cells 
or whatever and tell me I’m wrong.” 

ESSENTIALLY YOU ARE RIGHT, 
MARTIN. HOWEVER, YOUR STATE- 



MENT IS NONRELEVANT. 

“It’s relevant to mel” Martin 
shouted. 

PERHAPS. HOWEVER, WHEN I 
TRANSFORM YOU FROM YOUR PRES- 
ENT PHYSICAL STATE INTO CHROMO- 
SOMAL-UNIT PACK SYSTEMS I WILL 
NOT BE ‘taking A HUMAN LIFE.’ I 
WILL MERELY BE REDISTRIBUTING

GALAXY 




M artin’s body was slick with 
moisture. A sickly odor 
exuded from his pores. Think, 
think — he had to think! Only, how 
could he think with his head 
splitting open? He wondered if there 
was anything as simple as an aspirin 
in a Number Four MediPacket, 
Modified. 

In moments his hands began to 
shake. He tried to stop them by 
putting them under his back, then 
clamping them to the arms of the 
couch. Nothing helped. The sweat 
on his body turned cold and he be- 
gan to tremble uncontrollably. He 
closed his eyes and forced his 
breathing back to normal. 

Maybe, he decided, it would be 
best to forget the whole thing. Stop 
fighting it. He had less than eight 
days of oxygen — even if the com- 
puter would let him live to use it. 
Those eight days would be pure 
hell — knowing they were the end, 
that no help was on the way. Why 
not just . 

He angrily swept the thought 
aside. Anything could happen in 
eight days. If he could stay alive 
maybe he could con the computer 
into sending a signal. Someone 
might pick it up. A range of five 
hundred light-years covered a pretty 
big chunk of space. 

Life Dispersal Carriers — great 
God, who had thought that one up! 
He wondered what the odds were 
against any of the one-hundred-mil- 
lion cellular bits of Able Martin ever 
getting anywhere. Or doing any- 



thing when they got there. Those 
kind of odds, though, didn’t seem to 
bother the computer at all. And why 
should they? Passengers in Chromo- 
somal Unit Pack Systems would 
find it difficult to complain to the 
space lines. 

Time . time . damn it, 
time was running out! Thirty-six 
minutes. Less than that, now. May- 
be there was something in the plane- 
tary survival gear. If he could find it. 
And get to it. Take a good slice at 
the fleshy walls. Maybe short out 
the computer and ... He tossed the 
idea aside. That wouldn’t get him 
any closer to activating the beacon. 
Hell, he wouldn’t know what to do 
with it if he found it. 

There was only one way. He’d 
known that from the beginning. 
Fight the computer on its own 
ground. The computer wasn’t 
God — it was a machine — a machine 
that used the tools of intelligence, 
but really had no intelligence of its 
own. Computers reasoned — but 
they only reasoned with what they 
had to work with. Didn’t they? 
Basically, then, while the computer 
had access to a great deal more 
knowledge than he had and could 
put it all together faster and 
better — he. Able Martin, could 
outthink it. If he pushed the right 
button at the right time. That was 
the key: the computer had limita- 
tions. Find those limitations. 

He tried to think back on what the 
computer had said. There had to be 
something. Somewhere. Option: ac-

tivate the signal beacon. No. The 
computer was stubbornly set 
against that. No time to argue the 
point. Option: Get to a planet. Get 
out of the capsule. Double-negative. 
He was a billion prime miles from 
nowhere. Option: talk the computer 
into letting him live long enough to 
dream up other options . 

Martin wearily swept the whole 
thing aside. It was hopeless. No 
time. Think, damn it! Look at it. 
Turn it around. Take it apart. 
“Computer.” 

YES, MARTIN. 

“How much time left?” 
SEVENTEEN MINUTES, TWENTY- 
ONE SECONDS, MARTIN. 

Martin’s stomach turned over. 
No time, no time! 



H e didn’t try to think. Just let it 
flow. Let it all run by like a 
swiftly moving river. Watch it as it 
passes. Warp. Malfunction. De- 
struction. Ejection. Beacon — 

Hold it. 

Something. 

He struggled to pin it down. 
Don’t struggle — relax. Warp. Mal- 
function. Destruction. Destroyed 
how? What did the computer say? 
“Computer!” 

YES, MARTIN. 

“How was the ship destroyed?” 

I HAVE INFORMED YOU OF THAT, 
MARTIN. 

“Inform me again!” Martin said 
savagely. 

YES, MARTIN. THE SHIP 



“Like you told it before. Exactly 
like you told it before.” 

THE SHIP WAS DESTROYED 

THROUGH A MALFUNCTION IN THE 
DAVIDSON AUXILIARY REGULATORS. 
ESSENTIALLY, INTERFERENCE 
FROM AN UNANTICIPATED MASS 

“Wait. There. An unanticipated 
mass. What — kind of a mass?” 

A MASS WITH A DENSITY OF 

“Forget the details,” Martin said 
quickly, “general description.” 

GENERAL DESCRIPTION: THE 
MASS IN QUESTION IS DEFINED AS A 
PLANETARY BODY. 

Martin’s heart skipped a beat. 
“Okay. Planetary body. And the 
ship came too close to it. So its mass 
interfered — Where? Where was the 
mass? In Warp?” 

NO, MARTIN. THERE ARE NO 
PLANETARY BODIES IN NONSPACE. 

“Then it’s here — in real space?” 

YES, MARTIN. IF THE DAVIDSON 
AUXILIARY REGULATORS HAD BEEN 
FUNCTIONING PROPERLY, PRES- 
ENCE OF A MASS OUTSIDE THE WARP 
WOULD NOT HAVE 

“There’s a planet here? And you 
didn’t tell me about it!” 

ITS PRESENCE WAS NOT RELE- 
VANT, MARTIN. 

Martin bit off his words. “Time. 
How much time?” 

TWELVE MINUTES, EIGHT SEC- 
ONDS, MARTIN. 

Martin took a deep breath. Easy. 
Take it easy . 

“The planet. How far away is it?” 

FOURTEEN POINT SEVEN MIL- 
LION MILES.

“How long would it take to get 
there?” 

NOT RELEVANT, MARTIN. 

“Hypothetically!”

“Air. How about air?” 

OXYGEN CONTENT IS SUITABLE 
FOR HUMAN LIFE. 

“Then why in hell — ” Martin 
paused, collected himself. “Please. 
Give me the reasons this planet 
isn’t — relevant to me.” 

SUITABLE OXYGEN CONTENT FOR 
SUSTAINING LIFE IS MERELY ONE 
REQUISITE FOR PLACEMENT OF 
SURVIVORS ON A PLANETARY BODY. 
OTHER FACTORS INCLUDE: PROBA- 
BILITY OF ADEQUATE FOOD AND 
WATER SUPPLIES. SUITABLE CLI- 
MATIC CONDITIONS . NEGATIVE FAC- 
TORS: POSSIBILITY OF PRESENCE OF 
LIFE FORMS INIMICAL TO HUMAN 
LIFE. POSSIBLE 

“Look,” Martin interrupted. 
"Those things are for me to decide. 
I’ll take my chances.” He stopped, 
bit his lip thoughtfully. “Wait. 
Wait, you don’t know whether any 
of those factors are relevant, do 
you? You said ‘possible,’ and 
‘probable’ — that means you can’t 
tell anything from here. Or can 
you?” 

NO, MARTIN. AT THIS DISTANCE, 
IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE TO COMPUTE 
MASS, DENSITY, ATMOSPHERIC CON- 
TENT, PRESENCE OF LAND AND 
WATER AREAS 



“Then you can’t say it’s not 
suitable — you haven’t seen it!” 

AFFIRMATIVE, MARTIN. 

“Then for God’s sake, let’s at 
least look at it! We’ve got the time, 
we can get there. What’s the big 
hurry to send me sailing off in your 
bloody whatever it is — lifebank

“Okay! You’ve got to — ” 

MARTIN. FIRST, I SHOULD NOTE 
THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF ACTIVAT- 
ING THE BTD WAS CONSIDERED, DUE 
TO THE PRESENCE OF THE PLANE- 
TARY MASS. HOWEVER, LACK OF ANY 
RADIO ACTIVITY OR EVIDENCE OF 
OTHER COMMUNICATION DEVICES 
NEGATED THAT OPTION. IT WAS 
NECESSARY, THEN, MARTIN, TO

I HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN EITHER 
EXERCISING THE STELLAR OUT-

THE STELLAR OUTREACH OPTION OR

FURTHER, EDICT ONE OF MY PRI-

Martin looked up wearily. “I 
have to ask. What’s Edict One?” 

EDICT ONE PROHIBITS ME FROM 
ENDANGERING A HUMAN BEING’s 
CHANCE OF SURVIVAL THROUGH 
NEGLIGENCE. 

“What?” Martin jerked up, then 
sank back limply to the couch. 

“Time.” 

SIX MINUTES, EIGHTEEN SEC-

EXPLAINED, IS COMPLETELY PAIN-

“Shut up,” said Martin. 

That was it then. Six minutes. 
Zero. There was no point in carrying 
the farce any further. Clearly, he 
had been had. The electronic 
halfwit was winner and still 
champion. 



H e thought about three girls 
who might miss him for a while 
and a number of creditors who

Martin took a deep breath. “I’m

JAMES WHITE 



The best answer to a question 
may be — yet another question! 



I 

I IKE a green and seemingly vir- 
j ginal carpet the planetary sur- 
face unrolled five miles below the 
slowing ship. The grasses and 
small plants showed no signs of 
vegetable blight — the atmosphere 
was free of industrial pollutants 
and there were no cities or surface 
transport networks of any kind. 
But to the ship’s sensors and the 
tired, experienced eyes of the crew 
the greenery was a beautiful lie, a 
cosmetic skin of apparent youth 
overlaying a world which for many 



68 




thousands of years had been drain- 
ed of all its natural resources, used 
up and emptied of all life above the 
insect level. 

“We’re wasting our time,” said 
Jan, in a tone that indicated that 
she was looking for an argument. 

Peter did not like arguing with 
her, especially during the last few 
minutes before touchdown, even 
though a searchship was fully 
capable of landing itself. He waited 
until the ship had recovered from a 
brief attack of the transonic shud- 
ders and their landing spot was 
centered in the forward viewscreen. 

Then he said, “Probably.” 

She gave a short sigh of irritation 
and tapped for a magnified picture 
of the landing area on her duplicate 
display. He could not see the parti- 
cular section she had blown up for 
closer examination because her 
head was in the way. 

Lit in profile by the screen, Jan 
looked almost young again. In sil- 
houette the graying hair and the 
fine facial wrinkles did not show. 
But it took more than a trick of 
back lighting, he knew, to cancel 
out the weariness and lack of hope 
in her body and mind — as well as 
his own. Like the salt used to pre- 
serve meat in ancient times, every 
cell and thought was soaked in it. If 
an old-time cannibal had taken a 
bite out of one of them, hopeless- 
ness and frustration would have 
been the strongest taste. 

Eighty years, he thought, was a 
long time to be doing the same job. 



The screen darkened as the 
ship’s nose went up, pulling for- 
ward-facing cameras off-picture, 
and they began falling tail-first into 
the increasingly resistant softness 
oftheir anti-gravity landing cushion. 
They touched down — the cushion 
flicked off and the ship rocked 
gently as the weight forced its 
landing legs deep into the soft 
ground. The all-around viewscreens 
lit up and the images steadied and 
sharpened as the ship came finally 
to rest. 

“We are wasting our time,” Jan 
persisted. “I’m sure we have been 
here before.” 

“Unlikely,” he replied, “but you 
could be forgiven for thinking so. 
One of these sites is very much like 
any other — the same green mounds, 
the same type and size of ruined 
buildings even, because they are 
probably examples of the most 
advanced and durable structures 
built by the same architect — ” 

He broke off because she was 
shaking her head. In a less concilia- 
tory tone he went on, “Are you 
suggesting that I made a mistake 
and we’ve doubled back to a site al- 
ready investigated? An understand- 
able error, you are doubtless 
thinking, caused by my advancing 
years? But you are forgetting that 
our computer, which isn’t subject 
to lapses caused by senile decay — ” 

“I could argue that point, too,” 
she broke in. 

His first impulse was to tell her 
that the recent trouble they had 



ANSWER CAME THERE NONE 



69 




had with the computer had been 
due to operator error and that she 
had been the operator, but he 
thought better of it. Instead he 
said, “Are you coming outside?” 
“Yes,” sTie replied. “I prefer 
talking to you to sitting here talking 
to myself.” 

“I’m glad,” he said dryly. “For a 
moment I wondered if the romance 
was going out of our relationship.” 

B ut they said very little while 
they were climbing into their 
protective suits, probably because 
he had touched on a subject to 
which they were both hypersensi- 
tive. He would willingly have bet 
that within the next hour there 
would be an argument about 
rejuvenation and that argument, he 
knew from bitter experience, no- 
body won. 

Preceded by a general purpose 
robot which, in addition to the 
usual sensory and specimen gather- 
ing equipment was also programed 
for medical and surgical emergen- 
cies, they moved down the ramp 
and onto the springy turf. The sun 
shone brightly out of a sky whose 
clouds could not have been more 
tastefully arranged by a landscape 
painter. The air was fresh and pure 
and eminently breathable, but their 
heavy protective suits were needed 
to protect them against the insects 
which crawled and flew and were 
incredibly vicious. Even though he 
knew that he would have no use for 
it, he wore a side arm because the 



regulations required him to do so. 

Jan did not wear one because, 
she was fond of saying, if a native 
life form more than two inches tall 
came at them she would be so 
pleased that she would want to hug 
the thing instead of shoot it. 

The insects were everywhere. 

Hundreds of the things died with 
each step the searchers took, while 
the robot’s balloon tires wreaked 
even greater havoc. But the dark 
and oozing tracks that stained the 
grass in their wake were gone 
before they had traveled ten yards 
because the insects ate each other 
and not, for some odd ecological 
reasons, the short grass that shel- 
tered them. Any insect left defense- 
less by death or injury disappeared 
quickly, right down to the last 
smear of juice or edible tissue. 

There had been a time when Jan 
and he would have examined the 
insects’ behavior for indications of 
developing intelligence — some sign, 
perhaps, that these last inheritors 
of this and so many other worlds 
would produce an insect gestalt 
with which the human race might 
eventually communicate. Now, how- 
ever, they walked between and over 
the all too familiar grassy mounds 
and ignored the senseless ferocity 
under their feet. 

Beneath the grass and the layer 
of warring insects the robot’s sen- 
sors reported the usual mixture of 
indestructible plastic debris and 
metallic oxides. Toward the end 
this particular civilization had used 



70 



GALAXY 




a lot of plastic because no metal 
had been available. Nevertheless 
the beings had built well and the 
plastic ruins still stood impres- 
sively tall in a few places, even 
though the builders had long since 
gone down before the insect enemy. 

“That one looks interesting,” 
Peter said, pointing toward a 
squat, five-story building that 
seemed to be structurally complete 
except for its missing roof. Many of 
the plastic windows were still in 
place, but rendered virtually opaque 
by weathering and the mosslike 
growth that also covered the walls. 
The ground-level entrance was 
large and clear of rubble. He 
added: “Do you still think that 
we’ve been here before?” 

“The familiar can look strange,” 
she said stubbornly, “if you ap- 
proach it from a different angle.” 
“And the wrong angle of view,” 
he replied, “can make the strange 
look familiar. But let’s stop arguing 
and start looking inside. We are 
supposed to examine at least one 
building on every site and more if 
we should turn up something 
interesting — ” 

His voice trailed into silence. He 
was thinking that one indication of 
approaching senility was the habit 
of explaining things to someone 
who already knew the explanation. 

AFEW minutes later the robot 
placed sensors against a wall 
and emitted high-pitched squeaks 
as it sonically analyzed the building 



for structural defects. Satisfied that 
the place was safe for human 
searchers, it preceded them inside. 

With the robot’s main beam 
trained at full intensity on the 
ceiling there was more than enough 
light for them to see around the big 
entrance hall. The remains of what 
might have been desks and possibly 
some clear-walled display cases 
were spaced at intervals about the 
floor, while the walls were covered 
with large pictures. A heavy dust- 
ing of living and long-dead insects 
over everything made it difficult to 
pick out details. 

The contents of the display cases, 
if they once had been display cases, 
were no longer recognizable. Most 
of the pictures, for some reason, 
were less obscured by insects and 
showed machinery with natives 
busy around it — Peter deduced a 
large factory complex and what 
looked like a supersonic atmos- 
pheric flyer of conventional design. 
A bank of elevators was framed 
against the wall facing the entrance, 
the doors collapsed outward under 
the pressure of the rubble that had 
eollected in the lift-shafts. 

A broad ramp curved upwards to 
the level above. The searehers 
began to climb. 

From their studies of sites visited 
earlier they had formed a vague 
idea of what the natives of this 
world had looked like arid of the 
way they moved when they were not 
riding in cars or flyers. Physically 
they had resembled short, wide-

based cones with a number of 
specialized appendages — manipu- 
lators, visual equipment and pos- 
sibly eating and breathing ori- 
fices — sprouting from the top. 
Presumably their brains were hous- 
ed somewhere inside the stubby, 
legless bodies, which had moved 
snail-like — but not necessarily 
slowly — on a wide apron of muscle. 
Stairs or ladders inside the dwell- 
ings had been conspicuous by their 
absence. 

As he mounted the ramp Peter’s 
eyes were fixed on the robot, which 
was capable of climbing anything, 
when Jan gripped his arm tightly 
and pointed ahead. 

“Look at those sculptures,” she 
said excitedly. ‘‘And undraped, 
too. This will answer a lot of the 
physiological questions.” 

Two enormous figures, five or six 
times larger than life, dominated 
the floor space at the top of the 
ramp. They had been cut from 
hard rock and the insects had left 
them alone — Peter saw that every 
muscle and joint and wrinkle was 
rendered in perfect detail. No 
wonder Jan was pleased. 

‘‘I suppose,” he said, ‘‘the 
smaller of the two is the female of 
the species?” 

“It’s easy to tell who is the medic 
in this family,” Jan said, shaking 
her head. “No. I’d say that the 
small one with its eye glaring ag- 
gressively at us is their equivalent of 
Neanderthal Man, while the tall 
one with the more specialized 



appendages, whose eyestalk is 
pointed skyward, represents the 
builders of this once-mighty civili- 
zation.” 

. which rose to its greatest 
heights, he added silently, and 
signaled its presence to the rest of 
the galaxy and then died, two 
thousand years ago . 

‘‘We’re lucky,” Jan went on. 
“We’ve found a cultural center de- 
signed for posterity — maybe even 
us. Look around you. Some of 
those display cases are still com- 
plete and their contents are undam- 
aged — which isn’t surprising since 
most of them contain oddly-shaped 
pieces of rock — ” 

She broke off and turned away 
from him. The robot was busily 
photographing the alien tableau 
and concentrating its main beam 
on the subject it had chosen. Jan 
switched on her suit light and 
picked her way along a cluttered 
aisle to the next ascending ramp. 
She went up it at a near run. Peter 
followed more slowly. By the time 
he and the robot found her 
crouched over a collapsed display 
case, she was still trying to catch 
her breath. 

“You shouldn’t run like that,” 
he said. “Over-exertion is. danger- 
ous at our age.” 

She waved his words aside and 
went on excitedly, “I was pretty 
sure below, but now there is no 
doubt in my mind. We’ve found a 
museum. The ground floor level is 
devoted to the race’s prehistory —

GALAXY 




crude stone implements, knives, 
early attempts at working clay or 
mud. On this level they have 
progressed to agriculture and weav- 
ing. Most of the specimens were of 
perishable vegetable matter, so 
time and the insects have done for 
them. But the wall pictures are well 
preserved and clearly show the level 
of culture of that period. Succeed- 
ing levels should bring us to the 
time when this civilization began to 
fall apart. We may even find the 
reasons for its collapse.” 

“We know the reason why it, and 
all the others, collapsed,” he said 
tiredly. ‘‘They had too many, 
smug, self-satisfied, selfish beings 
eating up too few natural resources. 
We’ve pieced together that particu- 
lar picture too many times — what’s 
begun to impress me is that nearly 
every culture we’ve found has left 
us a lesson of its past; not one a 
lesson for survival.” 

“I know,” she replied, some of 
the enthusiasm fading from her 
tone. “But finding this building 
was a piece of rare good luck and 
there might be another piece just 
waiting for us. We’re due some 
good luck and I have a feeling — ” 

“You always have a feeling,” he 
broke in. ‘‘It’s called wishful 
thinking.” 

“Are you trying to be nasty or 
can’t you help it?” she said angrily, 
then went on: “Right here we may 
be able to piece together a complete 
picture, instead of searching all 
over the planet for pieces of the 



jigsaw — and probably missing most 
of them. I’m glad you made that 
mistake and doubled back here 
because — ” 

II 

AMN it,” he said furiously. 

X-r“You keep insisting that we 
landed here before, but we can’t 
have done so. The computer isn’t 
your specialty, so I can’t com- 
pletely convince you that when I 
program the ship for a search it 
cannot possibly make that kind of 
error.” 

‘‘It couldn’t — but maybe you 
could,” she snapped back. Then, 
more quietly, she went on, “You 
are sure that you didn’t make a 
mistake and I am sure you did. So 
we are having this stupid argument 
and letting it blunt our powers of 
observation and reasoning. We’ve 
found something I think we missed 
before and you don’t. That doesn’t 
alter the fact that we could be on 
the point of learning the workings 
of an extra-terrestrial culture that — 
in all respects save one — might 
make ours look medieval by com- 
parison. 

“This is all wrong,” she went on 
seriously. “We’re losing our sense 
of proportion. I think we’ve let our- 
selves grow too old. We seem to do 
nothing these days but argue and 
snap at each other and we could be 
missing important data simply be- 
cause we are squabbling instead of 
looking.”

“I know we’re growing old,” he 
said, “But the last time this subject 
came up we agreed that there 
would be no more rejuvenation pro- 
grams unless we found — ” 

“You agreed. I had reserva- 
tions.” 

He took a deep breath and tried 
to hide his anger at having to say 
something he had already said too 
many times before. 

“We’ve already undergone three 
rejuvenations. There is no problem 
about getting another. Even though 
the treatments are restricted be- 
cause there are too many people, 
our work insures our being made 
young again with no quibbling. At 
the same time — if we go through 
the process once again we’ll be 
morally obliged to continue our 
work as searchers. And I, for one, 
do not think that I could stand 
another twenty years doing — this. 
Even as a youthful, vigorous, 
clear-eyed grave-robber instead of 
an elderly specimen with hardening 
of the intellect. We’ve already 
known lifetimes of disappointment. 
To extend it by another twenty 
years is more than I could take. I’m 
sorry. But if you want to apply — ” 
He could see her head shaking 
inside her helmet. 

She said, “No. I do as you do.” 
“But — ” he said dryly. 

“But,” she said softly, “I miss 
the fringe benefits.” 

For a few seconds they stared si- 
lently at each other. Then he 
grinned and suddenly they both 



laughed. The problems were still 
there — nothing had changed so far 
as their personal difficulties were 
concerned but, for a short time at 
least, the senseless arguing was 
over. 

THERE anything special I 

Xshould look for?” he asked 
when the therapeutic laughter had 
ceased. “Something to indicate 
species survival?” 

“I don’t know,’’ she replied. 
“Look for something different, 
some new idea or facet in the cul- 
ture that would make it unlike any 
of the others we’ve investigated. It 
could be a scheme for population 
control or feeding — maybe an idea 
that came too late to do these 
creatures any good, but one we 
might use on Earth before we go 
the same way. But I would especial- 
ly like to find some indication 
that — before their culture fell 
apart — some of them were able to 
get away and plant a colony. In the 
two thousand years since this world 
stopped signaling a flourishing 
colony could have come into being 
in another system. A colonization 
project like that is important 
enough to have a place in a 
museum,” she added, “and its 
position in space would almost 
certainly be included in the ex- 
hibit.” 

In short, he thought wearily as 
they moved toward another ascend- 
ing ramp, we are still looking for 
our own image .

They had been looking for 
‘people’ on the first search mission, 
Peter remembered, but on that oc- 
casion it had not seemed to matter 
too much when they had not found 
them. The prospects had been too 
new, strange and exciting — setting 
out in one of the first searchships 
with everyone wishing them well. In 
many respects it had been like a 
honeymoon — for Jan and himself it 
had been their honeymoon — and 
those tend to be perfect in every 
way, especially in retrospect. 

Using the newly developed star- 
drive they had jumped ten light- 
years into interstellar space, de- 
ployed their vast antennae and lis- 
tened. More accurately, the ship’s 
sensors had listened while the 
personnel carried out explorations 
of a more personal nature. The 
weeks of waiting had passed pleas- 
antly enough while the antennae 
scooped up mush from stellar ob- 
jects that radiated on the bands 
above and below the visible spec- 
trum. Then, suddenly, a signal had 
come that could only have had an 
intelligent source. 

It was simple, repetitious and as 
individually unique as a signature. 
As expected, it faded out within a 
few minutes and returned, again 
for only a few minutes, just over a 
day later. 

During their training on Pluto 
Station they had listened to record- 
ings of many such signals. The 
theory had been that the “mes- 
sages” emanated from antennae on 



worlds that could well lie halfway 
across the galaxy and that the 
periods of silence corresponded to 
the rotational period of the trans- 
mitting planet. It was also thought 
that the transmitting antennae 
were steerable, so that they painted 
virtually all of the surrounding 
space in measured, vertical sweeps. 
This theory proved true in the 
majority of cases, the searchers dis- 
covered later, but there had been a 
few worlds where the signals had 
been sent from a transmitter in 
orbit. 

Peter had taken a fix on that first 
signal and he and his bride had 
jumped one hundred light-years 
closer. Then they had taken an- 
other fix and jumped again. There 
was no need to make sense of the 
signal although they had often 
tried — it was simply an alien voice 
saying over and over again that it 
was there. 

Then, abruptly, it was no longer 
there. 

They had back-tracked until the 
signal was coming in again, then 
made a long jump at right angles to 
fix the system’s position by triangu- 
lation. Within a few weeks they had 
found it — and arrived on a world 
wiped clean of intelligent life. / 

T ^ HE SYSTEM had been some- 
thing like four thousand light- 
years from Earth and in all 
probability its signals had been 
coming long before human technol- 
ogy had reached the level of being

able to detect them. Radio fre- 
quency emissions traveled at the 
speed of light, and their ship had 
continued to encounter those sig- 
nals for more than half of its four- 
thousand light-year journey, so that 
the civilization which produced 
them had lasted for at least two 
thousand years. 

But even long-lived, stable and 
technologically advanced cultures 
come to an end and, when such a 
civilization fell — it fell hard. 

Peter’s and Jan’s feelings on 
finding that first dead world had 
been of mild disappointment rather 
than sorrow. They had been un- 
lucky first time out, they told them- 
selves, and next time there would 
be people — new, alien and perhaps 
dangerous people — to contact. 

The risks involved were not great 
because a race that advertised its 
presence all over space would 
probably welcome contact. But on 
that first world there had been only 
insects and the remains of a great 
civilization in a remarkably good 
state of preservation. Jan and Peter 
had taken back specimens and 
records that had advanced Earth 
technology by a half-century. Their 
debriefing had lasted for nearly 
three years, during which they had 
been heaped with academic and 
other honors as had, to a lesser ex- 
tent, the other searchship crews 
who had brought home smaller 
pieces of the alien bacon. 

Finally they had been allowed to 
try again. 



The second world they found had 
also died long before its radio 
signals had finished their slow 
journey to Earth. There were 
interesting artifacts and useful 
processes on that world, too, and 
on the many others they visited. At 
home everyone benefited from the 
steady feedback of alien know-how. 
But the searchship crews grew tired 
of robbing technological tombs. 

They wanted to find people . 

((XT EXT TIME we’ll ask for a trip 
into the Galactic Center — ” 
Peter began, then stopped. He had 
made the same suggestion at this 
stage of the investigation of nearly 
every planet they had visited. 

“We tried that once and were 
nearly killed,” Jan replied. “If you 
remember — stars there have young 
planets and it is easy to have the 
ship wrecked by an extra-terres- 
trial mammoth or an outbreak of 
volcanic activity. But you know all 
this,” she went on irritably. “Why 
bring it up again when you’ll end by 
arguing that it’s better to follow a 
signal — because then we are sure of 
something having been there — than 
to launch ourselves into a forest of 
stars where life as we know it has 
not had a chance to evolve. 

“We’ve never delayed our rejuve- 
nation treatments as long as this 
before,” she added, “and I think 
that we’re becoming forgetful as 
well as bad-tempered, myself in- 
cluded. Or have you a fresh idea 



76 



GALAXY 




about a Center search?” 

He shook his head. “Not really. 
My idea is that we take rejuvena- 
tion again and, young and healthy 
and with our reflexes speeded up, 
we make a three-year random 
search of the Center. The planets 
we find may be composed of 
primeval magma, but there is still a 
chance that we will find intelligent 
life. Maybe young life — but intelli- 
gent. A fresh star. We can’t go on 
forever trying to talk to alien 
ghosts.” 

“Neither can we talk to alien 
children or mindless alien em- 
bryos,” she replied. “We must find 
someone our own age to play with.” 

“Yes,” he said. 

They had climbed from the third 
floor of the building and were 
beginning to explore the fourth. 
The equivalent of the industrial 
revolution had been left behind and 
nuclear energy had been released, 
although not in time of war. In 
common with all of the other dead 
cultures they had studied, this one 
had had very few major wars in its 
recorded history. Progress in all of 
the arts and sciences had been slow 
and at every stage the culture had 
remained stable. The beings ap- 
peared to have been cooperative, 
easy-going and seemingly happy. 
Their world had been a nice place 
to live. 

The display cases on the fourth 
floor were relatively undamaged, 
but their metal contents were ir- 
regular masses of corrosion. Plastic 



components and models, although 
discolored and encrusted with dead 
insects, were in good condition. 
And the searchers were encounter- 
ing more and more specimens of 
plastic books — great, thick-paged 
tomes whose text seemed to float 
above the pages and whose illustra- 
tions gave an illusion of perfect 
three-D on a flat surface. 

“They’ll be interested in that 
particular effect at home,” he said. 
At least I hope they will, he added 
silently. The people at home were 
becoming disinterested in every- 
thing — including themselves. 

“Yes,” she replied, “and the 
contents of this building will enable 
me to finish this mission in two or 
thref months instead of a year. We 
were lucky finding a museum — ” 
“Landing here wasn’t a waste of 
time, then?” 

H e did not know what was driv- 
ing him to restart the argu- 
ment which, only a few minutes 
earlier, he had been so glad to end, 
but he felt angry, frustrated and 
depressed and suddenly he wanted 
someone besides himself to suffer. 

“No, it wasn’t a waste of time — ” 
she began testily, then stopped. For 
a few seconds she stared at him as if 
he were her patient and she a doc- 
tor or nurse, her expression sympa- 
thetic rather than angry. Then she 
went on: “Look at that mural over 
there. One of their interstellar 
radio transmitters, wouldn’t you 
say?” 



ANSWER CAME THERE NONE 



77 




Feeling even more annoyed by 
her sympathy, he looked in the 
direction she was pointing and 
nodded. The murals were large and 
in a very good state of preserva- 
tion and, like those in the lower 
levels, they* were displayed in 
chronological order, beginning at 
the right of the entrance ramp and 
running around three walls to end 
on the left of the ascending ramp to 
the next level. Two sets of trans- 
mitting antennae were pictured on 
adjacent murals, one built on a 
snow-streaked headland overlook- 
ing an angry sea and another set in 
desert land. 

The next few murals in line 
showed advanced agricultural pro- 
cesses on land, sea and under the 
sea — a lot of wall space had been 
devoted to the solutions, however 
temporary, of the problem of 
feeding a rapidly increasing popu- 
lation. The desert transmitter was 
shown again, its bright metal 
dulled by the passage of centuries 
and the surrounding desert con- 
verted to a green and yellow patch- 
work of field tended by agricultural 
robots. 

His eyes moved to the next 
picture and he laughed sardoni- 
cally. 

“Well, now,” he said. “It seems 
they built their interstellar signal- 
ing devices several centuries before 
they attempted their first space 
flight. They were a smug, self- 
opinionated bunch of — ” 

"Maybe they had their priorities 



right,” Jan broke in. “After all, 
they must have realized that there 
was a strong possibility of life in 
other star systems as soon as they 
outgrew the idea that their particu- 
lar world was unique and the center 
of the universe. They probably 
decided that an interstellar drive 
was beyond their technical capa- 
bilities.” 

“The stardrive was beyond our 
technical capabilities, too,” he said 
drily, “until we began looking for 
unlikely solutions instead of ob- 
vious ones. The whole concept is so 
obviously impossible that it was 
sheer — ” 

“So they chose instead,” she 
continued firmly, “to signal their 
presence to the rest of the galaxy in 
the hope that someone with a star- 
drive would come to them, and they 
could then do a spot of high class 
technological horse-trading. They 
were an intelligent and patient race 
who obviously believed that every- 
thing comes to those who wait.” 

“We came,” he replied grimly, 
“two thousand^ years too late.” 

Ill 

T i HEY DID not speak again until 
they had completed their circuit 
of the murals and were moving to- 
ward the top of the last ramp. The 
robot’s lighting was no longer 
necessary because the roof of the 
topmost level had fallen in, wreck- 
ing most displays and covering the 
floor with rubble, which was in turn 



78 



GALAXY 




covered by patches of grass. But 
here, too, the murals showed 
clearly through their thin coating of 
living and dead insects. 

“They must have had a pretty 
potent insect repellent,” he said, 
“to be able to keep the surface of 
those pictures clear after all this 
time.” 

“But they weren’t able to kill 
them all,” she said softly. “Nobody 
ever succeeds in killing them all.” 

The murals showed space mis- 
sions to the nearer planets and 
bases being set up. But there were 
no indications of the colonization of 
the worlds concerned, much less 
the building of generation ships for 
a sub-lightspeed attempt at plant- 
ing an interstellar colony. The 
transmitters were shown again, still 
patiently sending their signals to 
the stars, which this race would 
never reach. There were pictorial 
examples of high-density living 
structures and high intensity agri- 
culture which was being troubled 
by some kind of blight. One of the 
pictures showed enlarged images of 
various types of insects with what 
could have been the chemical 
symbols representing the insecti- 
cide that would kill them. 

There was no sense of urgency or 
fear in the pictures — the museum 
had been built by a long-establish- 
ed and stable race which did not 
frighten easily. But to a search- 
ship’s crew which had seen it all 
before the signs were plain. An- 
other flourishing culture, severely 



weakened by diminishing food and 
energy resources, was about to go 
down before an enemy too small 
and mindless even to know or care 
that it had won. 

“Let’s go back to the ship,” 
Peter said dully. 

Jan nodded, still looking at him 
as if he were ill, and said, “Then 
what?” 

“Then we’ll talk about some- 
thing other than grave-robbing for 
the rest of the evening. Tomorrow 
I’ll help you begin to evaluate this 
material until it is time to go 
home.” 

“And then?” 

H e had taken her hand to help 
her over a pile of rubble, and 
now that they were retracing their 
steps along a clear section of ramp 
he continued to hold it for reasons 
he could not define. He was still 
angry. He knew that she had always 
been argumentative and strong- 
willed. But there had been times 
when even the serious arguments 
had been of no real importance and 
had been quickly forgotten, instead 
of dragging on interminably and 
poisoning their conversation and 
their work for days on end. 

“Then we’ll go home and rejuve- 
nate for one last trip,” he said. 
“You’re right about our condition, 
of course — we spend too much time 
arguing and not enough searching. 
And we really should make our last 
trip in top physical condition. We 
just might find something.” 



ANSWER CAME THERE NONE

“And if we don’t?” 

“We resign,” he said firmly. 
“I’m pretty sure there will be no op- 
position. The number of searchship 
missions has been reducing steadily 
over the last ten years and even our 
top people are beginning to lose 
hope. There are also signs that our 
culture, too, is becoming self-satis- 
fied and self-centered and begin- 
ning to die on its feet. One of these 
decades we’ll lose our sense of 
adventure, our insatiable curiosity 
about the universe and the beings 
who inhabit it. We’ll begin to set up 
interstellar radio transmitters and 
settle back to let the Others find us. 

“By that time,” he added, “we 
two will have used up our fourth 
period of youth and our final old 
age in sampling the delights of our 
smug little culture, while trying not 
to notice the news flashes about 
insects — or other rivals — adapting 
to our latest pesticides.” 

“That might not be much fun.” 
“Of course it won’t be fun,]’ he 
told her. “So maybe we’ll make two 
last trips or even three — the more 
last trips we make the greater will 
be our chances of finding some- 
thing.” 

“This is hopeless,” she burst out 
suddenly. “It always has been 
hopeless. We’re wasting our time.” 
“I know,” he said. 

But the searchship crews had 
been chosen very carefully from 
that large, but rapidly diminishing, 
number of people who could not 
give up hope. An unbiased observ- 



er, while considering this particu- 
lar psychological type, might have 
said that steadfastly refusing to 
face inevitable failure was utter stu- 
pidity. But it had been stupidity of 
this order that had taken the race 
so rapidly, if at times violently, to 
its present cultural and technologi- 
cal eminence. And certainly mo- 
mentum powered by persistent stu- 
pidity had produced both the star- 
drive and gravity control and — now 
that humanity had finally renoun- 
ced war an even higher order of 
stubborn, self-aware stupidity was 
driving them to find a partner be- 
fore their culture became too in- 
grown. And before the stupidity 
that had made them great became 
lost in a rising tidce of intelligence 
and philosophical acceptance of 
static realities. 

As they followed the robot to the 
ground-level entrance Peter remem- 
bered the other planet-sized grave- 
yards they had visited. The inhabi- 
tants of those worlds had been 
humanoid in the majority of cases, 
but some of the others had been 
visually unpleasant. But in each in- 
stance they had built civilizations 
for themselves that were rich, 
stable, peaceful and, by Earth 
standards, extremely long-lived. 
They had matured early and given 
up such childish and destructive 
pursuits as war and racial or re- 
ligious/sociological discrimina- 
tion while they were still young. 
Their cultures had been nice places 
in which to live — and perhaps a 



80 



GALAXY 




pleasant life was all that any life 
form could reasonably expect. 

“Sometimes,” Peter said sud- 
denly, “I think we’ll never grow 
up.” 

“That could be a better way to 
live,” she argued, “than growing 
up too soon and having nothing to 
live for but the contemplation of 
the racial navel.” 

J an’s first instinct was to 
argue, he thought tiredly, and it 
always had been for as long as he 
had known her. But nowadays the 
arguments were lifeless, hopeless 
and petty instead of being the in- 
tellectual challenge they once had 
been. He relaxed his grip on her 
hand, but she tightened hers and 
would not let go. 

She said, “Species with a long 
period of gestation and pre-adoles- 
cence have a much greater poten- 
tial for development than — well — 
alien butterflies. Maybe we aren’t 
really stupid, just too young to 
know any better. And now we may 
have passed the post-puberty stage 
and have left home to look for a 
mate. An intellectual mate,” she 
added. “I was speaking figura- 
tively.” 

“I realize that,” he said and 
laughed in spite of himself. 

“I’m sorry,” she continued, in a 
tone that was both apologetic and 
defensive. “From the very begin- 
ning I warned you that I would 
always speak my mind and tell you 
whenever I thought you were 



wrong. You used to say that my 
candor was stimulating and — Well, 
it really doesn’t matter. I don’t 
want to win every battle. And we 
certainly did not waste our time 
landing here.” 

He waited until they were outside 
the building before speaking. The 
sun was close to the horizon and the 
bright green mounds of rubble and 
the few intact structures were bath- 
ed in a dramatic orange light — the 
area had the sharp clarity of a stage 
set. From all around came the 
buzzing of the insect audience. 

“On the very few occasions when 
you were wrong,” Peter said care- 
fully, “you used to apologize and 
admit it. This time you apologized 
without actually admitting that you 
were wrong, which means that you 
still think that you are right and 
that we came down here through 
my error.” 

“Oh, let’s forget the whole thing 
and stop fighting. Please.” 

He shook his head. “I’m not 
fighting. But if I made a mistake I 
want to know about it. Show me 
proof.” 

“You’ll also be annoyed about it 
for weeks — ” She broke off and be- 
gan looking around carefully, ob- 
viously taking her bearings, then 
she pointed. 

“It should be about four hun- 
dred yards in that direction,” she 
said. “It could be a patch of dis- 
eased vegetation or a trick of the 
light, but only a searchship makes 
a mark like that and I caught a

81 




glimpse of it as we were landing." 

H e saw the saucer-shaped de- 
pression as they breasted the 
next high mound. It was about 
thirty feet across and carpeted with 
vegetation whose color was a shade 
lighter than normal because the 
grass in the area had been flattened 
both by the landing and takeoff of a 
searchship and the new growth had 
had to struggle through the crushed 
remains of the old. Many such de- 
pressions had been left on this and 
other worlds in their eighty years of 
searching. 

“Judging by the age of the new 
growth,” he said, “this must have 
been our first planetfall. But the ro- 
bot can check it against the known 
growth rate and give a close ap- 
proximation of the time of landing. 
Then I’ll know exactly when the 
mistake was made in the search 
pattern — if in fact a mistake was 
made.” 

She pulled her hand away from 
his and said angrily, “Don’t be so 
childish! Rather than admit you 
made a mistake you are suggesting 
that some other searchship wander- 
ed into the galactic sector assigned 
to us and landed here. That is ten 
times more impossible than the im- 
possibility of your making an error. 
Maybe I should instruct the robot 
to run an ID check on the depres- 
sion to make sure that it was our 
ship that landed here.” 

He had been staring at the 
ground while she had been speak- 



ing, studying the deeper and more 
well-defined hollows around the 
circumference of the depression 
that were the marks left by the 
stabilizers and landing legs. His 
pulse was thumping so loudly that 
subjectively it seemed much louder 
than his voice. 

“Yes. Do that.” 

“No. You do it!” 

“My mental state at the mo- 
ment,” he said quietly, “makes it 
unlikely that I would be able to 
frame the instructions in a suffi- 
ciently coherent manner for the 
robot to understand.” 

“You framed that sentence well 
enough — ” she began, then stop- 
ped to stare at him. He could see 
the concern returning and replac- 
ing the anger in her face, and he 
knew that the sunlight reflected on 
his visor made it difficult for her to 
see his expression. She gave the 
necessary instructions to the robot 
and they stood back to enable it to 
work freely. 

“You’re taking this very badly,” 
she said worriedly. “I’m sorry. You 
don’t make mistakes as a rule and 
this was such a small one that — ” 

“Promise me one thing,” he said 
very seriously, gripping her arm 
and squeezing it to accentuate his 
words. “If at any time in the future 
you feel like expressing an opinion 
likely to displease me, or you feel 
the need to criticize something I 
have said or done, or failed to say 
or do, or you want to make an 
observation about anything impor- 



82 



GALAXY 




tant or even trivial, go right 
ahead.” 

S HE OPENED her mouth to speak, 
looking completely baffled, but 
he waved for silence. The robot had 
completed its investigation of the 
depression and the markings 
around it and was making its re- 
port.

She turned toward him and said 
warmly, “I’m glad you didn’t make 
a mistake — ” Then she stopped as 
the implications began to sink in. 

“It also means,” he said, “that 
somebody else is searching for 
people and finding graveyards. It 
means that somebody else has 
discovered the stardrive and is 
using a conventional antigravity 



thruster for takeoffs and landings — 
probably because there is only one 
way to build the thing. 

“It means,” he went on, “that we 
will have to go on searching for 
long-dead civilizations, because 
they were the only kind that signal- 
ed their presence over a period long 
enough to attract the attention of 
ourselves and the other searchers. 
It also means that instead of 
robbing graves we carve our initials 
and a message on them — more ac- 
curately, we will devise weather and 
insect-proof radio beacons contain- 
ing data on Earth and its position 
in space. We will scatter them over 
the new worlds we find, as well as 
the ones we have already covered, 
because we have no idea how many 
of them have yet to be visited by the 
Others. 

“Most of all,” he ended jubilant- 
ly, “it means that one day a beacon 
will be discovered and opened by 
people who, like us, were not 
content to sit and wait.” 

Suddenly they were hugging each 
other, a ridiculous and senseless 
thing to do considering the thick- 
ness of their protective suits. But it 
did not matter. Her face was 
younger than he could remember 
for a great many years — more ani- 
mated and vital. She was looking, 
he realized suddenly, the way he 
felt — as if he had just undergone 
rejuvenation. 

Gently he pushed her away from 
him and said, “Let’s go back to the 
ship, dear. We’re wasting time.”*

W E PICKED the pieces of Harry 
Alberni out of the cold green 
water of the Strait early one Sep- 
tember evening. We laid him on the 
deck of the slow, rolling double- 
ender and gathered around to hear 
his last words, if he were capable of 
uttering them. 

“Make for port, Sagar,” some- 
body said, voice canine with urgen- 
cy. “Give the man a chance. What 
the hell are you thinking about?” 
The water was dribbling away 
from Alberni’s clothes into the 
scuppers and his broken body 
rolled with the motion of the boat, 
like a jellyfish dressed in sling- 
glider’s clothes. But Alberni was 
going to speak. I knelt down, bent 
over him. The others. Freemen and 
State Prisoners alike, were silent, 
watching, listening. Nobody had 
ever listened to Alberni before. 
Why should his words have this 
new special value merely because 
he was dying? 

Alberni spoke, the words little 
whispers, puffs of evanescent steam 



in the September air. “It hurts like 
hell, Sagar,” he said. 

We all knew that. We could see it 
in the lines of his face, in the gro- 
tesque attitude of his body. The 
steel spinal support, worn by the 
sling-gliders to guard against just 
such an accident as Alberni’s, was 
twisted, projecting from under his 
body like a compound fracture. 

“We’ve got no dope, Harry. I’m 
sorry. I just brought a few people 
out for the afternoon to watch the 
gliding. I didn’t expect — ” 

There were tears in his eyes. 
“Oh, God, I didn’t think it would 
be so bad. Why the hell should it 
hurt so much?” 

There was a rescue boat in sight 
now, skipping over the waves. I 
looked at the eight men standing 
above me. Their faces showed con- 
cern of one sort or another. 
Tranter, the man who had wanted 
me to head for port, was still fidg- 
eting, face twitching as his eyes 
flickered from Alberni to the ap- 
proaching launch. I didn’t know 
the other men, but I could place 
them. There were two worried Free- 
men whose afternoon’s pleasure 
had been spoiled — or fulfilled — by 
the tragedy. And there were five 
State Prison men. Two were im- 
mediately identifiable by their dark 
green coveralls, marked S.P. in 
large white letters front and rear. 
The other three . 

Like their uniformed comrades, 
they were smiling. 

That’s was how I could tell what 



85 




they were. They were bonded men 
under the care of the three Free- 
men, so uniforms were not neces- 
sary. But they were smiling as a 
Freeman died — and that was uni- 
form enough. The penal laws had 
divided mankind into two classes. 

I could hear the rescue boat 
now — that bouncing, thumping 
whine of fiberplast and turbines 
hopping waves. I turned back to 
Alberni and for a moment I 
thought he heard it too, because his 
eyes had widened and he was 
regarding the sky intently. But 
there was no change in focus as my 
head cut off his view. 

I stood up as the rescue launch 
cut engines and fell to the water, 
slowing abruptly and wallowing 
toward us in a wide turn. Fenders 
bumped lightly and two men leaped 
to my deck. 

“Alberni, is it? How is he?” The 
mediman had set down his bag and 
was already selecting a hypojet. 
The other man was a bonded State 
Prisoner and he was staring down 
at Alberni with an intensity that 
told me he was Alberni’s man. 

Two men, bonded together in 
unequal partnership until death 
intervened — or the senior partner 
canceled the contract . 

‘‘You’re too late,” I told the 
mediman. 

He shrugged and turned away, 
but the S.P. man remained, gazing 
at the body, his expression chang- 
ing to one of incredulous, trans- 
cendental joy. 



“You bastards!” he shouted, a 
high cracked yell of ultimate de- 
light. “I’ve beaten you all, you bas- 
tards!” 

He climbed back aboard the 
rescue launch. His contract was 
over. He was a Freeman. I heard 
him laughing as the stretcher-bear- 
ers arrived and scooped up Alberni. 

B y now the curious had gather- 
ed. Half a dozen boats, large 
and small, bobbed around us as the 
occupants strove to get a glimpse of 
death, craning necks, tiptoes, hang- 
ing from forestays. Off the port 
bow the bright remains of the sling- 
glider drifted away like a dead 
macaw. 

I heard someone whisper, “Cari- 
oca Jones — ” 

The 3-V star’s hydrofoil was 
there, idling beside the splintered 
alloy and torn fabric. The boat was 
about thirty feet long, sleek and 
black; across the stern the name 
Flambuoyant was painted in lumi- 
nous white letters a foot high. Two 
women leaned against the stainless 
steel after rail, gazing at the wreck- 
age. I recognized Miss Jones, al- 
though she had been absent from 
the 3-V alcoves for several years — 
there was no mistaking that long 
hair, sprayed midnight with ultra- 
sorb, falling past her downturned 
face, like a frozen jet cataract. She 
seemed to be wearing a tight black 
sheath dress, thigh length. A land 
shark lay at her feet. 

The girl by her side was by con-

trast fair and her hair was short. 
She looked across at us and smiled 
slightly, ruefully, as though to say: 
This is what you get for indulging 
in stupidly dangerous sports. Her 
eyes were blue and she had a snub 
nose and. I’ll swear, freckles. Her 
youthful appearance was belied by 
full breasts beneath the amateur 
sailor’s blue pullover. 

I saw all this briefly, very briefly, 
because nobody looks away from 
Carioca Jones for long. The star 
had shifted her position as her boat 
drifted nearer — the wind threw a 
curtain of hair across her face and 
she shook her head. The light-ab- 
sorbing strands parted, revealing — 
startling and dark-tipped — her 
bare, pale breasts. On a late Sep- 
tember afternoon. I think every 
man on my boat drew a sharp 
breath as desire punched him in the 
stomach. 

She sensed us. That sort of 
woman always does — it’s basic. She 
sensed us and looked up as a fe- 
male animal hearing a mating call. 
And her eyes met mine. 

She was old, horribly old, and 
her black eyes knew me for a necro- 
phile. 

This was the end of summer, 
when everyone on the Peninsula 
tried sling-gliding and some fared 
better than others. I had tried it 
myself, once, borrowing the gear 
from Doug Marshall and being 
lucky, because gear must be indi- 
vidually tailored and an incorrectly 
balanced glider can mean death. 



After that one try I kept my feet on 
the deck and spent the weekends 
cruising spectators among the Gulf 
Islands in my ancient double-ender, 
while the tiny bright gliders fled 
silently across the sky like swift 
paper darts. 

After pausing for an instant to 
gather the appreciation to which 
she was accustomed, Carioca Jones 
turned away from the rail and sat 
down beside the other girl in the 
cockpit. I heard the faint silver 
tones of an orchestrella. A weather- 
beaten adonis in S.P. coveralls 
handed them drinks, then took the 
wheel and gunned the motor. The 
craft leaped away, climbing its 
hydrofoils like stilts. 

“Lucky guy,’’ said a voice. It was 
one of the Freemen. The State 
Prisoners had not ventured any 
comment. “What a way to serve 
your sentence — ’’ He laughed tact- 
lessly. “Almost makes crime worth- 
while, eh. Tranter?” 

Tranter, the officious type who 
had tried to take command when 
we picked up Alberni, grunted. 
“Not like you think, I reckon. They 
say she’s queer. Shops around, too. 
That blonde’s the latest. Nice look- 
ing kid. Pity.” 

Somewhere, somehow, there is 
always someone who will claim 
personal knowledge of the homo- 
sexuality of a public figure. Tranter 
was talking garbage, a proclivity of 
his type. There had been nothing 
queer about the way in which 
Carioca Jones’ eyes had met mine —

I still felt faintly nauseated. 

B y MONDAY morning I had for- 
gotten about Alberni, Tranter, 
Miss Jones and the rest of them, 
and was back in the weekly routine. 
I was standing at the window look- 
ing at the frosty 'morning when I 
caught sight of a movement among 
the bushes on the opposite side of 
the tiny bay. Then there was still- 
ness again and a noise from the sea 
and after a while Doug Marshall’s 
boat came past, towing some fool 
on water-skis with a sling-glider 
strapped to his back. 

For a while I cursed Marshall for 
waking the entire neighborhood — 
he represented a tangible scapegoat 
for my having to get to work. Then 
I pulled on my clothes, gulped 
coffee and stumbled outside. Silkie 
ran to greet me, pink with happi- 
ness and uttering the high-pitched 
whine that is the slithe’s way of ex- 
hibiting delight. I picked him up, 
stroking his incredibly soft skin 
while his reptilian eyes regarded me 
with cold joy. I carried him to the 
factory gate where Dave was wait- 
ing. He looked as though he had 
some personal complaint so I 
thought it best to make trite con- 
versation, fast. 

“Dave,” I said. “I saw Carioca 
Jones yesterday.” 

“She’s moved in, over Deep Cove 
way.” Dave Froehlich knew every- 
thing that happened on the Penin- 
sula. “I was meaning to tell you. 
You ought to cultivate her.” 



“Have you seen her? Close to, I 
mean?” I gave a short laugh. 

He regarded me steadily. “She 
could be a customer, Mr. Sagar,” 
he said. 

The factory was emerging from 
the mist, a gaunt timber structure 
at the waterside, its cedar shingles 
silver and black with age. Through 
the windows I could see uniformed 
men working. Behind the building, 
merging into the bushes, were the 
slithe pens where the little reptiles 
scuttled. 

“Look here, Dave,” I said sud- 
denly. ‘‘I saw a slithe in those 
bushes over there earlier, from my 
window. They’re getting out again. 
How the hell do they do it?” 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Sagar. I’ll get 
George to inspect the pens again.” 
His face was wooden. 

“Forget it, for God’s sake.” A 
phrase came into my mind, a 
phrase from decades, centuries ago 
when educated man found that he 
was surrounded by equals and in- 
vented class distinction to fill the 
gap. The phrase: He Knows his 
Place. 

Dave Froehlich Knew his Place 
and, by God, he was never going to 
let me forget it. 

He was my personal bonded 
State Prisoner for a period of three 
years — the standard sentence for 
embezzlement of a sum of not more 
than two thousand dollars, which 
was Dave’s crime. I think I am a 
reasonable master. I provide him 
with accommodation and pay him a

small amount for pocket money, 
which is more than many bonded 
S.P. men get. In return, he must 
make himself useful to me in so 
many ways that one wonders at the 
possibilities of misuse of the penal 
code . But at least the moral is 
clear. Stay honest. 

The other men, those uniformed 
goons in the factory, are not so 
lucky. I hire them from the State at 
an hourly rate. They receive no pay 
themselves and they live in the 
prison. They are little better than 
cattle. If they behave themselves — 
if they are lucky — someone might 
like an S.P. man enough to take 
him on bond — which means his 
sentence is automatically commut- 
ed by one-third. 

“Maybe you ought to realize just 
how damned lucky you are,” I once 
said to Dave. 

“Maybe,” he grunted, peeling a 
slithe. 

“I suppose you’d rather go back 
to the old system,” I said with some 
heat — it was one of those bad days. 
“You’d like to sit around on your 
tail doing nothing all day, kept by 
society. Is that what you’re saying? 
You’re saying that because you 
stole somebody’s cash you’ve got a 
right to a three-.year vacation?” 

He flushed and for once 1 had 
him going. “I made one mistake, 
Mr. Sagar, just one. Okay, so I’ve 
got to pay for it. But the way things 
are now — you own me. You can do 
what you like with me. It’s degrad- 
ing.” 



The slithe skin was hanging from 
his fingers — he released the reptile, 
dropping it over the wire into one of 
the pens. I glanced at the fine, al- 
most transparent skin the slithe 
sheds every six months or so. It 
possessed that grayish, curiously 
inert look that is characteristic of 
the unattached skin — a sort of 
waiting look, waiting for a host, 
waiting for an emotion to latch on 
to. 

And where Dave’s fingers touch- 
ed, the skin glowed bright blue. 

Just a small area, the size of a 
fingerprint — but it told me what 
Dave was thinking, what his emo- 
tions were concerning me, concern- 
ing everything. It showed, just for a 
moment, that Dave hated — and 
there was no way he could fool that 
membrane. 



I T TOOK us an hour or more to 
examine all the netting, repair 
the holes and retrieve the escaped 
slithes, and by that time I hoped 
Dave’s mood had improved be- 
cause no one can go on hating 
forever and he was a damned good 
foreman. I think this Jatter asset of 
his was the reason he was almost 
smiling as we dropped the last 
slithe back into its pen and relaxed. 
He has the interests of the farm at 
heart and will be truly glad when 
his time is up and he can stop 
hating and take up that partner- 
ship I’ve half-promised him. We 
walked slowly toward the factory.

“Hi, there! Have I come to the 
right place?” 

I swung around and saw her 
standing at the gate. Maybe lean- 
ing against it would be a more ac- 
curate description, leaning in just 
such a way that 'the top bar pushed 
into her breast and made me think 
of her as a woman, not just as a 
person wondering if she had come 
to the right place. And from the 
direct stare I got from those aged 
and ageless eyes I knew she knew 
there was no mistake. 

Beside me Dave drew a sharp 
breath and I tried not to look at the 
skin he held. 

Instead I looked at Carioca Jones 
and said; “I hope so. I’m Sagar and 
this is my slithe farm. Can I help 
you?” 

I moved to open the gate but she 
was already through, twisting to 
shut it behind her, then smiling 
directly at me like a death’s head. 
“What Sagar?” 

“Joe.” 

“I’m Carioca Jones. Didn’t I see 
you — ” 

“Out in the Strait yesterday. I’d 
just pulled the body of Harry 
Alberni out of the water,” I said 
brutally. 

“God, did he dieT' She was an 
actress. Her expression of horror at 
the death of a perfect stranger was 
well done. 

“It was an accident, one of those 
things. The mediman didn’t get 
there in time. Nobody could be 
blamed.” 



The Flymart landed in the yard, 
rattling off a list of the day’s bar- 
gain offers almost before the rotors 
had stilled. The hatch slid open, 
displaying shelves of groceries. I 
handed my list to Dave and moved 
away from the din, drawing Miss 
Jones with me. Today she was 
wearing a sober brown, neck to 
knee, and I briefly thanked God for 
this sane September Monday morn- 
ing. 

“So these are the slithes. I’ve 
heard so much about them. Where 
do they come from?” 

“They’re imported.” 

“Slithes. What a curious name.” 

“Lewis Carroll. From slithy, 
meaning lithe and slimy. 1 think it’s 
quite apt — but it tends to distract 
from the fact that they’re pleasant 
and friendly little things. And 
unusually intelligent for reptiles. 
Silkie, now — ” I picked up my pet, 
still pink, and held him out to her. 
She reached out a tentative finger 
and prodded him behind the ear in 
that slightly embarrassed manner 
of the nonanimal-lover. 

“Oh, look at that. He’s changed 
color!” 

“They do. That’s their attrac- 
tion.” 

“Yes, I suppose so. It’s funny,” 
she laughed girlishly, “I’d never 
thought of the animals changing 
color. I mean, I knew the skins 
changed color, that’s what they’re — 
uh — for. But the animals — I’d 
never really thought about animals, 
you know.”

She thought the skins grew on 
trees, was what she meant — if she’d 
ever thought of trees, that is. But 
she looked more like a customer 
every minute. I continued my spiel, 
which had been interrupted by 
Silkie’s involuntary display of dis- 
taste. “The chameleon effect fulfills 
a number of purposes for a slithe 
on its home planet. It’s a mating 
display, for one thing. When the 
animal turns pink it’s letting the 
love object know of the attraction. 
Then, as a defense mechanism, 
when the slithe feels itself threat- 
ened it will turn a livid purple in an 
attempt to frighten its enemy.’’ 

“How positively fascinating, 
Joe.” 

“The skin holds the secret. It’s 
triggered by changes in the body, 
by heat, sweating, adrenalin or 
whatever. But the most remarkable 
thing is, it lives even after it’s been 
shed. Put it against human flesh 
and it’s sensitive to human emo- 
tions.” 

And, T refrained from saying, 
slitheskin has learned some new 
colors, that way. 



II 

W E ENTERED the Small show- 
room and she admired the 
displays, fingering the bandanas, 
kerchiefs, muffs, pendants, wrist- 
lets, all those things women wear 
when they hope to display an affec- 
tion they are too shy to put into 



words. Or — as frequently hap- 
pens — when they are so completely 
exhibitionist that they want to 
parade their emotions — any emo- 
tions — in front of the world. 

Carioca Jones stood too close to 
me and handled all these things 
and turned them pink. 

“I want a dress!” she cried sud- 
denly. “I want a whole dress made 
out of your skins, and I want it to 
fit close. What do you say?” 

“We don’t really do that sort of 
thing,” 1 mumbled as she arched 
her back over the display counter 
and looked up at me, her throat 
wrinkled like a condor’s. “There’s 
a lot of work involved in joining 
skins so the seam doesn’t show. 
And it’s damned difficult to match 
the tones. The cost is out of all pro- 
portion. We try to stick to things 
that can be made out of one skin.” 
Her eyes had narrowed slightly. 
“And why do you think the cost 
should worry me?” 

“Well, I — I like people to know 
what they’re letting themselves in 
for.” 

“Listen to me, Joe Sagar. I never 
go into anything with my eyes 
closed, not anything, I want you to 
remember that.” Abruptly she was 
smiling again, toying with a slithe- 
skin bandana whieh had undergone 
as rapid a eolor transformation as I 
had ever seen — pink, blue, pink, 
almost as quickly as you can say it. 
“Make me a nice dress, Joe. I can 
afford it.” 

“I’ll let you have the estimate to- 



THE GIRL WITH THE SYMPHONY IN HER FINGERS

morrow if you like, Miss Jones.” 
She turned away and I accom- 
panied her across the yard to the 
gate — Silkie trotted at my heels. 
Her car was parked under the trees; 
there was a feint sound music. I 
opened the door for her. 

The snub-nosed blonde was sit- 
ting in the passenger’s seat, an 
orchestrella on her bare knees. She 
wore a light gray sweater and a 
no-skirt skirt. She looked up and 
smiled, but her smile was for 
Carioca Jones. The music changed 
tone, became gay as her long 
fingers shifted and worked inside 
the egg-shaped instrument. 

Somehow I managed to bid 
Carioca Jones a polite goodbye. 
Then the car rose from the ground 
in a swirl of damp autumn leaves 
and glided away, taking the girl 
and the music with it, leaving me 
with the aftersight of beauty. 

O F COURSE I had to find an ex- 
cuse to call on Miss Jones — and 
the blonde — as soon as possible. 
When the estimate had been com- 
pleted I persuaded Doug Marshall 
to take me gliding and contrived to 
make a clumsy landing near the 
beach which backs on to the Jones 
residence. I fought clear of the har- 
ness and made my way through the 
shallow water to the shore, drag- 
ging the tiny glider after me. Then I 
climbed the tumbledown steps 
above the high-water mark and 
hurried through the trees in the di- 
rection of the house. 



I heard the music while I was still 
among the trees, that melodic, yet 
unearthly tone which characterizes 
the orchestrella. For an instant I 
paused, trying to establish from 
which direction the sounds came — 
then 1 walked on again, turning left 
through a pergola which gave onto 
a tiny sunken lawn. 

The girl was sitting on a rustic 
seat, the instrument in her lap. She 
was totally oblivious of my presence 
as 1 stood behind her waiting for a 
break in the flow of the music, 
reluctant to interrupt. It was like a 
setting from an ancient oil paint- 
ing — the lawn, the shrubs with 
their late September flowers, the 
over-hanging trees, the girl all 
dressed in white — I felt I had 
stepped into a dreamlike past. So I 
stood waiting just for a little while 
and the music flowed on from her 
sensitive fingers. 

At last 1 recalled myself to the 
present. 1 coughed, thinking what 
an ugly noise it was in the midst of 
this beauty. The music stopped. 
The girl swung around, her eyes 
widening in surprise. 

‘‘Sorry to interrupt,” I said. 
‘‘I’ve brought the estimate for Miss 
Jones.” 

“Oh, you startled me. How did 
you get here? I didn’t hear a car.” 

She had spoken without any 
particular warmth — indeed, I don’t 
think she recognized me. I intro- 
duced myself. 

She told me her name was 
Joanne and for a while I thought 



92 



GALAXY 




things were going well — then I told 
her about the glider. 

If I had hoped to impress her 
with my daring, 1 failed. Her 
manner became stiff and she made 
a few pointed remarks about play- 
boys with bonded men at their beck 
and call. I tried to explain that I 
normally worked on Thursdays but 
lacked the nerve to tell her I had 
come in the hope of meeting her. 

“What’s going on here? Oh, it’s 
you, Joe. I heard voices.” 

Carioca Jones stepped down to 
the lawn. 

“I was just telling Joanne. My 
glider came down off your beach.” 

“Oh, do you glide? How thrill- 
ing.” 

We made our way down to the 
beach and I showed her the glider, 
then Marshall and his man Charles 
arrived and towed it away. I got out 
of my wet suit. Marshall glanced at 
me from the boat. 

“Why don’t you come up to the 
house and have a drink, Joe? You 
don’t have to go, not yet. I can run 
you home. Then we can talk about 
the dress in comfort. Joanne, you 
bring him up in a minute or two.” 

S HE departed without waiting for 
a reply — after all, who could re- 
fuse an invitation from Carioca 
Jones? Leaving Joanne and me 
standing on the beach and Mar- 
shall grinning at us from the stern 
of the launch as he headed out to 
sea. 

In fact we were not yet quite 



alone. An obscene shape flopped 
past, undulating like a sealion, and 
a cold eye dwelt on me in passing. I 
shuddered, feeling a sudden chill. 

“I suppose she keeps that brute 
around so she can look beautiful by 
comparison,” I observed. 

Joanne walked away from me 
without speaking and sat down on a 
tree stump, placing the orchestrella 
in her lap. I heard a few sad 
chords. 

“Is it any good my telling you 
Carioca is a fine person?” she 
asked quietly. “A lot of people 
don’t understand her, you know.” 

“Why did she go off like that?” 

I saw the paleness of her face as 
she looked up and from her voice I 
imagined she might have been smil- 
ing again. “She doesn’t want our 
company right away. I rather think 
she’s going to — change into some- 
thing more suitable to entertain a 
male visitor.” 

“She’s wasting her time. I didn’t 
even notice what she had on just 
now.” 

“Didn’t you,” murmured Joanne 
wonderingly and began to play. I 
could just make out the whiteness 
of her fingers shifting as they ca- 
ressed the interior of the instru- 
ment and the melody flowed all 
around, bathing us like the warm 
sea of a tropic summer as we sat on 
the chill September beach. 

She played for a long time, 
although it seemed just a moment — 
I knew this because suddenly when 
she finished it was very dark and I

remembered we were supposed to 
be up at the house. Joanne remem- 
bered at the same time — she jump- 
ed to her feet with a gasp of alarm 
and 1 climbed stiffly from my heap 
of driftwood. We hurried up the 
path, the wet misty webs of the 
night spiders drawing cold lines on 
our faces. 

The house was ablaze with light. 
I hesitated as one does before enter- 
ing an ominously large and noisy 
party. 

“I could do with a drink,” I 
muttered from force of habit. 

Joanne laughed. ‘‘You’ll get 
one — don’t worry.” She hesitated. 
‘‘In fact I’ll get you one myself. I 
think Carioca still isn’t ready.” 

A hint of stiffness, of embarrass- 
ment, in the way she said this last 
caused me to look at her, then 
follow her gaze to an upper 
window. Miss Jones moved past, 
whitely naked in the brightness. 
We went into the house and Joanne 
made me sit on a low, receptive 
chesterfield. ‘‘Because I rather 
think Carioca will want to sit next 
to you,” she said with a real, 
genuine grin. She brought me a 
scotch and ginger. 

It was a large, comfortable 
room — the motif was based on the 
historic Western Seaboard Slide, in 
common with many of the Penin- 
sula residences. I suspected the 
featured spiral staircase came from 
the liner Princess Louise — now a 
hotel twenty miles inland — and the 
floor was original sediment. Polish- 



ed and glazed, the rich brown ooze 
showed a multitude of species of 
marine life which had been strand- 
ed decades ago when the tidal 
waves swept over the low Peninsula. 

“Look — ah — Joanne, what ex- 
actly is your function here?” I 
asked bluntly. 

“Carioca would call me her com- 
panion,” she replied, unoffended. 
“I suppose I’m a sort of agent, 
bodyguard, secretary. I just keep 
things ticking over, I guess.” 

“Does she work much now?” 

“Oh, now and then when she 
feels like it — not a lot. Hardly at 
all, I suppose. Oh, hell. If you 
really must know, she doesn’t 
work. She’s not in fashion now, if 
you know what I mean. It hurts 
her. That’s why she sometimes 
seems a little abrupt, you know. 
She’s a wonderful person, really. 
She’s been great to me, like a — like 
a sister,” she said, defiantly daring 
me to interrupt with a more tactless 
simile. 

“I’m glad you’re happy,” I said 
helplessly — there was something 
disarming about this girl which 
voided the mind of smart answers, 

“Carioca likes to be the center of 
attention — hadn’t you noticed? She 
always has been and now she’s 
having trouble realizing things just 
aren’t like that any more. I rather 
suspect,” she said sadly, “that her 
ordering a slitheskin dress is just 
another bit of compensation. After 
all, you can’t get more flamboyant 
than that.”

A dress a woman wears directly 
against the skin — and one that re- 
flects her every emotion in its 
color . 

“You don’t approve of the 
dress?” 

“Not for her. I think it’s a shame 
she has to call attention to herself 
that way. But there it is. She’s used 
to being the center of attraction.” 

And when Carioca Jones made 
her grand entrance a few moments 
later, I could see what Joanne 
meant. 

F or a start, an open spiral stair- 
case is a revealing item of 
furniture for a woman in a short 
dress to descend. The impression of 
stark cold metal against warm soft 
flesh heightens the effect. But, as 
Joanne had said, it was a shame. It 
was a shame, I was thinking, that 
she moved slowly, so slowly down 
the stairs, maybe because she was 
getting on in years and didn’t want 
to fall. I wasn’t supposed to think 
that at all. So by the time she 
reached the bottom and began to 
make her swaying way across the 
petrified sediment I was feeling 
quite sorry for her. And, to be 
honest, her figure was good — ob- 
scenely good — and just about as 
interesting as one’s mother’s. I 
averted my eyes from the exposed 
flesh. 

She held her face up to be 
kissed — at least giving me the 
choice of splashdown area. Then 
she proceeded to chatter away as 



though I’d only just arrived, and 
led me back to the chesterfield. 

“Joanne, darling,” she cooed, 
“play for us while we talk, there’s a 
dear. Something nice and slow and 
smoochy.” 

I’d only met her once before 
today and that had been a business 
meeting. I wondered how she would 
behave if I were a close friend — and 
then I wondered how many close 
friends she had and felt sorry for 
her again. 

Joanne had moved over to a piece 
of furniture which, at first glance. 
I’d taken for a 3-V alcove. It was a 
sort of half-dome which somehow 
suggested excellent acoustics, or 
the womb, according to how intro- 
verted one felt at the time. Like a 
quarter of an egg. She moved inside 
and, I think, sat down — it was hard 
to tell, as the interior was coated 
with that new paint that absorbs all 
light. Then her hands appeared, 
slipping into the orchestrella which 
sat on a low stand. The effect was 
most spectacular — hands appear- 
ing from the blackness, holding the 
instrument. 

I excused myself from Carioca 
and walked over, standing directly 
in front of the alcove. I still 
couldn’t see Joanne. Only her 
hands were there, right in front of 
me, caressing the orchestrella. It 
was uncanny. Then she began to 
play, disembodied hands moving, 
astral music filling the room, and I 
returned to Carioca with some 
reluctance.

“Well,” she said, smiling. “Now 
here we are. Isn’t this delightful?” 
“That’s an interesting piece of 
furniture you have over there.” 
“Quite, but we don’t want to talk 
about boring old furniture, do we? 
Tell me about* yourself, Joe. Why 
does a man like you hide himself 
away among those funny little 
animals?” 

“It’s a living.” The music, which 
Carioca had intended to remain 
background, had impressed itself 
on me by its sheer power and 
beauty. I couldn’t help but listen to 
it. “Has Joanne ever thought of 
taking that up professionally?” I 
asked. 

“My dear, why should she need 
to when she’s got me?” There was 
more than a hint of acid in her 
voice. 

“She’s very good.” 

“Oh, let’s forget Joanne, for 
heaven’s sake, Joe. I didn’t invite 
you here to talk about her.” 

The trapped feeling flustered me 
and I said something foolish. 
“What did you invite me here for?” 
“Well now, aren’t you the force- 
ful one?’’ She edged closer, all 
thighs and shoulders. “I asked you 
here because I like you, Joe. And 
because you’re making a nice dress 
for me — ’’ Her voice hardened 
again here and I took the point. 
The dress was far and away the 
most profitable order we were likely 
to get this year, and it looked like 
being a long, hard winter. 

“I’m very flattered. Miss Jones.” 



“Carioca.” 

“Can I get you a drink?” 

“Oh, not now. Not when you’re 
just going to tell me all about 
yourself ...” 

So I sighed silently and began to 
tell her my life story, making it as 
interesting as possible in the hope 
that she would concentrate on the 
abstract past instead of the physical 
present. I don’t think I succeed- 
ed, because her eyes were on my 
face for the whole of the time I was 
speaking, which is unusual for the 
recipient of a life history, no matter 
how fascinating. I would look 
away, visualizing some incident 
from the past as I described it, and 
every time I looked back at her 
those dark eyes were fixed on mine 
like mating slugs. If I looked at 
them too long I couldn’t see the 
hardness of the face and the 
wrinkles, because eyes themselves 
are moist orbs and nothing more — 
so, hypnotically, they would be- 
come young as I watched. 

I averted my gaze again, remov- 
ed my hand which somehow seem- 
ed to have got on her shoulder and 
the music intruded again and I was 
saved. 

“But how can you make the dress 
if you don’t know my measure- 
ments?” 

“Just lend me a dress. Any one 
that fits. I’ll take it with me and let 
you have it back tomorrow. Or the 
next day.” 

“Oh, but that’s most unsatisfac- 
tory. I want to be sure it’s right. It’s 



96

going to cost a lot of money.” 
‘‘There’s no hurry,” I said 
desperately as she jumped up and 
began to make for the stairs, pre- 
sumably in search of a tape 
measure. “I have to keep a bunch 
of animals together for at least 
three weeks so that they get attuned 
to each other’s emotions and the 
skins match up when they shed 
them. Otherwise the dress would 
look like a patchwork quilt.” 

I WAS wasting my time — she was 
already out of earshot. I heard a 
chuckle clearly among the music 
and looked quickly toward the 
semidome. 

“For God’s sake come and help 
me out, Joanne.” 

In answer the music swelled to a 
derisive crescendo with undertones 
of The Wedding March as Carioca 
began her descent of the staircase. 
“Here!” she cried. “I’ve found a 
tape measure. Now we can get it 
over with. Come on!” 

She took my hand and pulled me 
to my feet — or more correctly, I got 
up before she landed in my lap. She 
led me to a darker corner of the 
room, out of sight of Joanne. “This 
will be fine, here,” she said. “I’d 
ask you to come up to my room, but 
it wouldn’t be quite right, would 
it?” 

Suddenly I wasn’t worried any 
more. She had no thought of 
getting me into bed, whatever im- 
pression she might give. She was 



Carioca Jones, playing her part. 
She was a born exhibitionist and it 
had been quite a while since she 
had displayed herself. Now she was 
virtually alone with a captive audi- 
ence and she was going to make the 
most of it. Was I feeling sorry for 
her again? Maybe, but I was an- 
noyed, too. She was using me, 
taking me for a ride. 

The music changed. 

“After all, the dress is worn next 
to the skin, isn’t it? So the measure- 
ments have to be taken next to the 
skin.” 

A most repulsive creature was 
humping its way across the vitrified 
past in our direction. 

Joanne was playing Duncan’s 
Allegro in E. 

“I’ve always thought that’s one 
of the most uplifting pieces ever 
composed, haven’t you. Miss Jones? 
And doesn’t Joanne play it well? So 
lively. My God, it makes you want 
to do calisthenics.” 

She wriggled back into her shoul- 
der straps instantly, coloring. She 
strode across the floor toward the 
semidome while I hurried after her, 
fearing mayhem. The land shark 
snapped at my heels, dislodging a 
shoe. 

She held the orchestrella before 
me. Her voice had become quiet, 
very quiet. “It’s quite easy to play, 
Joe, and very interesting. I used to 
be able to play it myself, one time, 
but you need young hands for that. 
Soft, like dear Joanna’s. You 
see — ” she plunged her fingers into 



THE GIRL WITH THE SYMPHONY IN HER FINGERS 



97 




the holes in the egg-shaped instru- 
ment — “the depth of the fingers — 
how far you push them in — controls 
the pitch. The position of the 
fingers, which dies of the holes you 
press, controls both tone and 
volume. Each finger can produce a 
sound like a violin, a piano, a 
guitar, a drum, even. Ten fingers — 
a ten-piece orchestra in the hands 
of an e.xpert.” 

Her hands were hooked into the 
instrument like talons. 

“I’m afraid my hands aren’t 
what they were. The sensitivity has 
left them, you see.” 

Joanne’s face appeared from the 
blackness of the semidome, strick- 
en. 

“No, nowadays I’m just a little 
bit ham-fisted.” 

The orchestrella screamed in dis- 
cord as she squeezed and kneaded. 
Then it was silent. 

Ill 

I TREATED that team of slithes like 
children. Immediately after ^ari- 
oca Jones placed her order I had 
chosen ten prize animals and Dave 
had built a separate pen for them, 
complete with heating in the hutch 
and a temperature-controlled pool 
in the small yard. It’s odd, the way 
we tend to regard the animals from 
a human standpoint. In point of 
fact, it didn’t matter a damn 
whether the slithes were happy — 
the important thing was that they 
all felt the same. If one of them had 



a bad day it was better that they all 
had a bad day. 

Very soon I found that my slithe 
team needed to be strengthened — 
something I should have known 
from the start. It takes more than 
ten slithes to make a tenskin slithe 
dress. The first disaster occurred 
two days after my fraught evening 
with Carioca Jones. 

The morning mist was cold and 
hung in beads from the chicken 
wire of the pens. I don’t know what 
prompted me to look out through 
my window at six a.m. — or even get 
out of bed. Maybe I heard some- 
thing. Anyway, as I gazed on the 
peaceful scene I saw a movement 
among the hutches. 

Slithes tend to become torpid 
toward winter — that’s why its better 
to heat the hutches. If exposed con- 
tinuously to the cold the creatures 
will virtually go into hibernation 
and that means no skin-shedding. 
So there is no way a slithe will be 
moving about his pen in the early 
morning — in common with myself, 
they are late risers. 

Soon I stood dressed and, shot- 
gun in hand, in the yard. I looked 
around, hefting the gun. They can 
say what they like about the advan- 
tages of the fanbeam laser rifle — it 
has none of the excitement of the 
good old-fashioned twelvebore with 
its thunderous discharge and wick- 
ed recoil. At this hour of the morn- 
ing I was itching to kill and to have 
killed quietly and efficiently would 
have been no sop to my temper

whatsoever. Something was prowl- 
ing around my pens and I wanted 
to blast it to hell. 

In point of fact it was an otter. 
He came around the corner of the 
prize hutch in that swaying, low- 
slung run which is not quite a 
scuttle, and in his mouth was 
struggling a member of my hand- 
picked team, vivid yellow with fear. 

The otter saw me and stopped, 
looking at me from bright, knowing 
little eyes as I leveled the gun at 
him. It was blackmail. I couldn’t 
shoot, not while he had the slithe. I 
watched him and he watched me 
and at the same time I tried to see 
where he had got through the 
chicken wire. Then I saw a tiny gap 
where the mesh met the damp soil. 
I reached it before he did — he 
dropped the slithe in order to bare 
sharp teeth in a snarl and came on. 
Although he couldn’t have been 
more than eighteen inches long, he 
looked savage and relentless and I 
backed off. I had always under- 
stood otters were playful creatures, 
spending their time sliding down 
river banks on their fannies. This 
one was acting out of character and 
it threw me. I had forgotten the 
shotgun, it was man to man stuff 
now. 

Uttering a vicious hissing noise 
he came under the wire, threw me a 
contemptuous look as he passed, 
trotted across the yard and disap- 
peared among the driftwood on the 
shore. I called it an honorable 
draw, because I had the slithe. 



I entered the pen and picked up 
the reptile. His skin was still 
yellow — it looked as though it had 
been permanently dyed that way. 

I tried. I put him back with the 
others and gave him a couple of 
days to recover, but it was no use. 
The fright had had a traumatic ef- 
fect on him and his presence made 
the others uneasy. He could not 
lose the yellowish tint, which 
individuals in the rest of the team 
were taking as a warning signal, 
causing their skins to fluctuate in 
unhappy sympathy. In the end I 
removed him and placed him in iso- 
lation. 

As a result of this event I doubled 
the size of the team. I could now 
afford ten individual disasters with- 
out threat to the dress project and a 
large, communal disaster did not 
matter unduly, provided all the ani- 
mals suffered the same. 

C AsiocA Jones came to see me 
the day after the otter incident. 
By the time I was told she was 
around she had already pumped 
Dave and was leaning over the prize 
pen in proprietorial manner. 

“Hi, Joe, darling. Your man tells 
me these are my creatures.’’ 
“That’s right. A fine bunch of 
animals. I picked them myself.” 
“But aren’t they a bit variegated, 
Joe darling?” Her sharp black eyes 
scrutinized the tiny herd as the 
animals crawled about. ‘‘It 
wouldn’t do for Carioca Jones to go 
dressed in motley, would it?” 



THE GIRL WITH THE SYMPHONY IN HER FINGERS 



99 




“I told you. They have to get 
used to one another.” 

“Oh, dear, they’re not like us, 
are they? I mean, we sort of hit it 
off immediately, didn’t we? I think 
you felt that, too, didn’t you, Joe?” 

“Of course.* Look — Carioca. Un- 
fortunately I’ve got a hell of a lot to 
do — ” 

“But I understand! I’ve only 
dropped by for a minute, Joe. I 
thought we might get the fitting 
done.” 

One of the State Prisoners was 
fooling about nearby, sweeping up 
or whatever the unbonded men 
grudgingly do when they see me 
around — and he glanced at me 
sharply. Carioca had opened a 
minuscule purse and was dangling 
a tape measure, which I regarded 
as one regards a krait. She was 
smiling knowingly. That damned 
measure was becoming almost sym- 
bolic. 

So I took her into the house and, 
unchaperoned, got it over with — 
the measurements, I mean. I don’t 
think she really expected anything 
else. She just had that knack of 
making anything appear sexual, 
which was why her career had been 
so successful and why it was over, 
now the bloom was gone. Sad? It 
was almost pathetic — I kissed her 
briefly as a compulsory compliment 
and got her out of the house. 

“Well now, that wasn’t so bad, 
was it, Joe?” 

“Uh.” 

“I’ll get out of your way now. I’ve 



got to go into town and do some 
shopping. I wonder — How would 
you like to come along? It would do 
you good to get away from this 
smelly old farm for a while. Eh, 
Joe? Maybe we could have a drink 
somewhere.” 

She had dropped the overempha- 
sized manner of speech, she had 
dropped the coquettishness, she 
was suddenly, genuinely trying to 
get through to me. She was lonely 
and she wanted company for the 
rest of the afternoon. I wondered 
what had gotten into her, then I 
remembered the episode of the 
orchestrella. 

“Where’s Joanne?” I asked. I 
hadn’t wanted to say it but I had to 
know. Her answer might explain 
something. It did. Her gaze shift- 
ed — she looked away. 

“Back at home,” she said. 

So there had been a split-up — 
not surprising after the orchestrella 
incident. I wondered if Joanne were 
packing her bags and leaving and 1 
think I felt lonely, too, then. 

“I’m sorry, Carioca,” I said. “I’d 
like to come. But I’ve got a hell of a 
lot to do here, like I said. Maybe 
some other time.” 

She smiled. “You really mean 
that, don’t you, Joe. How nice. We 
must make a date sometime.” 

“Great.” 

I walked with her to the car and 
held the door for her. She couldn’t 
resist vouchsafing the usual thigh 
display as she got in. 

Then she looked at me and said 



100 



GALAXY 




in completely flat, neutral tones, “I 
must hurry. I’ve got to buy an 
orchestrella before the stores close. 

I’ve often wondered about the 
way she said that. I’ve tried to 
visualize the moment, the way she 
looked, her tone of voice. And 
there’s nothing I can pin down, 
nothing that might give me a clue 
as to what her intentions were that 
September afternoon. Nothing to 
tell me whether I was terribly to 
blame for what happened subse- 
quently. 

Was she saying she was sorry? At 
the time I thought so, but then, she 
is an actress. 

T he car rose and whined off and 
she was gone. I was left 
thinking about Joanne again, as I 
did so often. And thinking about 
Joanne and the wrecked instru- 
ment, which it seemed Carioca had 
achieved the decency to replace— I 
suddenly thought I might make 
some recompense also. After all, I 
was partly to blame. 

I went into the factory and gave 
Dave careful instructions. I wanted 
to give Joanne a present; not some- 
thing ridiculously expensive like 
Carioca’s damned dress — just 
something small and appropriate. 

But as I went outside again, feel- 
ing Dave’s amused gaze on my 
back, I wondered if maybe I just 
wanted to be around when Joanne 
wore slitheskin for the first time. 

I was so engrossed in this specu- 
lation that I jerked in dangerous 



proximity to heart failure when her 
voice spoke right next to me. 
“Good afternoon, Mr. Sagar.” 
“Uh, God. I didn’t see you 
arrive, Joanne. Call me Joe. What — 
how did you get here?” 

“Oh, I borrowed a car. Look, 
Joe, have you seen Carioca?” 

“You only just missed her.” 
“Did she say where she was 
going?” 

“Town. She was — ” I stopped in 
time; maybe the orchestrella was 
supposed to be a surprise. “Is it 
anything urgent?” 

“I don’t know.” She hesitated. 
“We haven’t spoken very much, 
you know, since — Then she went 
off this afternoon without saying a 
thing, not a thing.” 

“Don’t worry. She was perfectly 
normal when I saw her.” 

“Oh, thank goodness.” She 
looked around at a loss. “Well, I 
must get going. I’ll see if I can find 
her in town. When we — when we go 
together, we usually split up for 
shopping and meet at the Princess 
Louise bar, at six. That’s where I’ll 
find her. I’m sure. She’ll be there.” 
“Joanne, I tell you, she’s okay.” 
She was fidgeting around and twist- 
ing the strap of her bag between her 
fingers and it was driving me out of 
my senses. I mean, here she was on 
my home ground and all we could 
talk about was an aging 3-V star 
who was more than capable of look- 
ing after herself. “Come in and 
have a drink, why don’t you?” 
“Oh, no, I couldn’t. Really — ” 



THE GIRL WITH THE SYMPHONY IN HER FINGERS 



101 




Briefly I wondered just how 
serious the row had been that had 
turned my calm, serene Joanne into 
this nervous wreck of a girl — ^yet 
had left Carioca virtually unmoved. 
I had my suspicions, of course, but 
I didn’t want to think about them. I 
mean, I was once again fighting the 
gathering notion that Joanne was 
not quite normal, if you know what 
I mean. And she was so pretty — it 
would be such a waste. 

“I’ll come with you,” I said. “We 
can all have a drink.” 

But with luck, I thought, we 
won’t be able to find Carioca 
Jones . 

T here was a lot of traffic 
about — by the time we parked it 
was five forty-five. I suggested to 
Joanne that we go straight to the 
Princess Louise and she agreed. 
Soon we were sitting in the period 
atmosphere of polished brass and 
varnished mahogany, drinking 
.scotch. 

Time has been kind to the 
Princess Louise. The records of its 
arrival are sketchy as the ship’s log 
was destroyed — along with the 
entire crew, so it is said — at the 
time of the Slip. I imagine it was 
very soon afterward that it was 
discovered by the few survivors of 
the tidal waves which had cleaned 
any other form of shelter off the 
surface of the Peninsula. These 
frightened wrecks huddled in the 
beached liner for months, maybe 
years, until they gradually drifted 



back into communication with the 
rest of the world. 

Their first contact doubtless 
came by means of the roving bands 
of Indians who had hunted the 
more northerly areas since time 
immemorial. By then, it is suppos- 
ed, the Princess Louise had become 
a village in its own right. Then 
suddenly the world returned and a 
city grew around the beached 
wreck. And with the arrival of 
people, history began to move for- 
ward again on the Peninsula. 

Joanne was loosening up a bit. “I 
expect she’ll be here in a moment,” 
she said. 

It was a start. And it was the 
point when I should have said 
something about hoping Carioca 
would be late because it was so 
pleasant with just the two of us, 
don’t you think? But somehow I 
couldn’t seem to get going. I’d 
never had any real conversation 
with the girl; I didn’t know what 
her beliefs were, her views, her 
tastes. As far as I knew, we had 
nothing in common. I was merely 
violently attracted to her physically. 
And I didn’t think we had that in 
common, either. 

So I didn’t know what the hell to 
say to her and the minutes were 
rattling away and Carioca would be 
here any minute. 

And damn it, the only thing we 
had in common was Carioca. 
“Look, I’m sorry if there was some 
sort of trouble,” I said, expressing 
frank manly sympathy. “I feel part- 



102

ly to blame, you know.” 

“I — I don’t see why.” 

“Well, you know — I was maybe a 
bit tactless praising your playing, 
knowing Carioca can get jealous. I 
didn’t think.” 

I had her attention now. ‘‘I 
haven’t noticed she’s particularly 
jealous,” she said. “She likes to be 
the center of things, yes. But 
jealous?” At last she grinned, a 
good straightforward grin. “I think 
she was annoyed because she 
wasn’t getting what she wanted, so 
she took it out on me — or rather my 
orchestrella — ” She hesitated odd- 
ly then, and the grin faded. 

“I’m not sure she — uh — wanted 
anything. She just wanted me to 
think she did. It was an act.” And 
it could be a dangerous act — this 
was when I experienced my first 
real twinge of uneasiness about Jo- 
anne’s position. She was incredibly 
naive. “Can’t you see what she’s 
really like. Joanne?” 

I had lost her again. “I know 
what she’s like, and she’s always 
been very good to me.” 

She was loyal to Carioca Jones 
and she was damned if she was 
going to denigrate her in front of a 
comparatively casual acquaintance 
like me. Apologetically I reached 
across the table and put my hand 
over hers. 

That was the moment Carioca 
Jones chose to arrive. As I tried to 
collect my thoughts I recollected 
that I had told her previously that I 
was too busy to come out. 



I OFTEN saw Carioca Jones during 
the next few weeks and when we 
met her manner was strange, 
although not unfriendly. She never 
referred to her meeting with Joanne 
and me at Princess Louise — or the 
public scene that had resulted. She 
dropped by every few days to check 
on the progress of her dress and 
chatted pleasantly about the prom- 
ising appearance of the slithes. By 
now the little reptiles were identical 
in their reactions — it was a pleasure 
to see them all change color, 
instantly and simultaneously, from 
dull brown to warm pink when I 
approached with their food. I cal- 
culated they would all be due to 
shed in a couple of weeks’ time and 
within two or three days of one 
another. 

Carioca was pleased with the 
progress — she apparently bore no 
grudge over the Princess Louise 
episode — yet there was something 
odd about her attitude. An air 
almost of suppressed excitement — 
which I took to be anticipation over 
the dress — and something else, 
something almost possessive in the 
way she looked at me. She had 
dropped the coquettish approach in 
favor of a more confident attitude. 
Sometimes when I caught her eye it 
held the glint of one who beholds a 
prime steak, medium rare. Antici- 
patory and predatory. 

Every time Dave told me of her 
arrival — she never came straight to 



THE GIRL WITH THE SYMPHONY IN HER FINGERS 



103 




the house, but waited to be an- 
nounced like royalty — I would 
hurry out and greet her, always 
looking past her to where the 
hovercar was parked. But there was 
never anyone in the passenger’s 
seat. I’m sure sKe noticed I was ab- 
stracted on these occasions and I’m 
sure she knew the reason, but she 
never commented. Joanne was a 
subject we simply did not mention. 

Just once she made an oblique 
reference to her companion. She let 
drop the news that she was 
practicing the orchestrella again — I 
presumed Joanne was giving her 
lessons. She held her knotted 
fingers before her as she said this, 
flexing them as though playing an 
imaginary instrument. It put me in 
mind of an eagle stooping on a 
lamb. 

I found an excuse to call on the 
house, once. I got Marshall to take 
me for a run in his hydrofoil and 
persuaded him to anchor off Cari- 
oca’s beach. He, myself and 
Charles, his man, sat in the cock- 
pit, drinking, while I kept my eyes 
on the shore. Marshall was talking 
about his new glider which he 
expected to be delivered later in the 
week. Charles and I listened, al- 
though from time to time I caught 
Charles glancing at me with a faint 
grin. 

“I think I’ll just slip ashore for a 
minute,” I said suddenly. 

They looked knowing. “Not for 
longer than an hour, right, Joe?” 
said Marshall. “I want to get in 



some practice later, before the new 
glider arrives.” 

It seemed a long time before I 
was hurrying through the trees but 
it was probably only a few minutes, 
such is the time-scale of love. The 
carport was empty so I could safely 
assume Carioca was out and that it 
was Joanne I had seen from the 
boat. Then I heard the sweet 
sounds of an orchestrella being 
played as only Joanne knew how. I 
slipped through the open french 
windows and crossed the floor 
quietly. The interior of the semi- 
dome was the antithesis of light but 
I could see her hands stroking a 
new and ornate orchestrella. I 
watched and listened for a while — 
then I spoke. Time was short and 
Carioca might return at any mo- 
ment. 

“Joanne — ” 

She stepped from the blackness 
and smiled at me. “Hello, Joe. I 
didn’t hear you come in. I’m afraid 
Carioca’s gone out for a while, but 
she’ll be back in about half an 
hour, I expect.” 

“I came to see you, Joanne.” 

I had been too direct. A flicker of 
alarm crossed her face. “Whatever 
for?” 

“I see Carioca’s bought you a 
new orchestrella.” 

“It’s not mine. It’s Carioca’s. 
She’s learning to play. The one she 
smashed was hers, too — I’d like 
you to understand that.” She 
looked around the expensive room. 

“Don’t be so damned humble.

Joanne. She’s not a goddess. It’s 
not a privilege for you to work here. 
She’s just an ex-star, a has-been. 
You’re worth a dozen of her. 
You’re young and you’re very 
pretty. You could be a star yourself 
if you had half the luck she had.” 

“Look, Mr. Sagar. There’s no- 
thing wrong in Carioca’s having 
been successful. I don’t like to hear 
people wanting to pitch her out 
with the garbage because she isn’t 
maybe — working so much these 
days. Look at it this way. She could 
have been just another married 
woman, an average housewife. 
Would you say a married woman 
was finished — a has-been — just be- 
cause she’s decided not to have any 
more children? The only person 
who knows if Carioca is finished is 
she herself — and judging from the 
way she is I’d say she’s okay — she’s 
fine. She used to be a star but now 
she’s changed direction. She’s mov- 
ed to the Peninsula with plenty of 
money. She doesn’t need to work 
and now she’s well on her way to 
becoming a pillar of local society, a 
person whom people want to know 
because she’s famous and interest- 
ing. She’s narrowed her aims and is 
specializing. How many people 
seek you out, Mr. Sagar? How 
many people make an effort to get 
to know you?” 

I wondered why she was talking 
like this. I’d seen no evidence of 
Carioca’s sudden popularity. It 
seemed that everything had gone 
wrong. I shouldn’t have come. 



“That’s not fair, Joanne. Maybe I 
don’t want people to seek me out.” 

‘‘Hey, you wouldn’t mind 
though, would you, Joe? You 
wouldn’t mind people pointing you 
out to each other and saying, there 
goes Joe Sagar, the world-famous 
slithe-farmer — ” Suddenly she was 
laughing. ‘‘Oh, Joe, why the hell 
didn’t you choose a more impres- 
sive name and job?” She looked at 
me, face flushed, and she was 
incredibly beautiful, infinitely de- 
sirable. 

I put my hands on her shoulders. 
“I’m happy the way I am. I don’t 
think Carioca is. I’m on an even 
keel but she’s on the way down. But 
I’d rather not talk about her ...” 

I drew her gently toward me. She 
disengaged herself and walked 
back to the semidome. 

“I’ll play for you, not with you, 
Joe,” she said. 

When Carioca arrived she found 
us just like that. I was standing, 
listening to the music and watching 
Joanne’s hands, because that was 
all I could see of her. 



T wo weeks later the slithes shed 
their skins and a week after that 
Carioca Jones’s dress was finished. 
I had a female State Prisoner in the 
factory at the time who was about 
Carioca’s size, so we gave her the 
dress to try on. When she reappear- 
ed she was smiling and radiant and 
the dress was a warm, uniform 
pink. The seams were invisible and

the fit perfect. The dress seemed al- 
most to blend with the girl’s own 
skin. She looked a hell of a lot 
better in it than Carioca would and 
she knew it. 

“Betty, you look fantastic,” 
breathed DaVe, popeyed with ad- 
miration. 

The dress blushed a deeper pink 
and I rather think something start- 
ed right there, judging by the look 
the S.P. girl gave Dave. 

It was a pity, but eventually we 
had to get the girl and the dress 
separated. I supervised the pack- 
ing. I didn’t want anything to go 
wrong at this stage. I had previous- 
ly packed my personal gift to 
Joanne and I sat looking for some 
time at the small box, wondering 
what the hell I ought to write on the 
card. 

I hadn’t seen either . Carioca or 
Joanne for over two weeks and had, 
in fact, been getting nervous over 
the order for the dress. There had 
been no answer to my calls and on 
the one occasion I had summoned 
up nerve to visit the house, it had 
been ail locked up. I had walked 
around and peered in at the win- 
dows — and things, thank God, had 
looked normal. I had even caught 
sight of the landshark and it had 
seen me and slithered across the 
floor, thrashed its way onto a chair 
near the window and looked out at 
me frozenly, evilly. A pulse had 
throbbed near its gills where the 
oxygenator had been implanted. 
Obviously things had been okay 



and someone had probably been 
coming in to look after the brute 
until Carioca and Joanne returned. 

All the same, I still couldn’t 
understand why Carioca hadn’t 
told me she was going away. 

Then, a few days before the dress 
was complete, her face had appear- 
ed on the visiphone screen. 

“Terribly sorry, Joe darling, but 
I had to go away for a couple of 
weeks, rather nasty, actually. 
Everything’s all right now, 
though.” In the background I 
caught sight of Joanne moving 
about and felt a huge relief. 

“What do you mean? What 
happened?” 

“Oh, such a silly thing. I was 
feeding Wilberforce and he bit me 
and I had to have shots and all sorts 
of stupid things.” 

“Wilberforce?” 

“You know him, my landshark. 
He’s such a pet really, and so good- 
tempered.” 

“You ought to have the bastard 
put down.” 

“Oh, I couldn’t. Anyway, I 
thought I’d better call to tell you 
everything’s all right here. And my 
dress? Is it finished?” 

“Almost. Just two or three 
days.” 

I T WAS, in fact, four days later 
when I called her and told her it 
was ready. She went into hysterical 
transports of delight and insisted 
that I bring it over right away for a 
ceremonial trying-on. By then it

was four o’clock in the afternoon, 
so I washed and changed and left 
Dave instructions to close up. As I 
drove over to Carioca’s place a ting- 
ling knot of nervous anticipation 
centered around my solar plexus. 1 
hadn’t seen Joanne for three weeks. 
I wondered if she had thought of 
me during that time. I wondered if 
she would like her present. Then I 
managed to think business again to 
the extent of hoping Carioca liked 
the dress. 

The lights were on in the house 
when I arrived and I could hear the 
soft sounds of the orchestrella. Twi- 
light was all around me as I hurried 
across the wet grass, then up the 
crunching gravel path to the front 
door, clutching the boxes. The air 
was chill and damp and I started at 
a rustling in the bushes; it was 
probably the carnivorous Wilber- 
force on a foraging expedition. The 
front door was ajar and I stepped 
inside. 

“It’s me!” I called. 

There was no reply so I entered 
just the same, sure of my welcome 
now that the dress was finished. 
The vast living room echoed to the 
glorious tones of the orchestrella 
and a drink stood on the table near 
the semidome. This was something 
of a royal welcome — obviously Cari- 
oca meant me to make myself at 
home while she slipped into some- 
thing easy to slip off again. I took 
the glass and strolled over to the 
semidome, watching Joanne’s pale, 
beautiful fingers working gently as

she changed subtly from the buoy- 
ant tones of the welcoming music 
into the melody of a tender love 
song. 

For a while I just stood and lis- 
tened, trying not to think about 
Carioca and the fact that she had 
told Joanne what to play. Instead I 
said to myself: This is for me. 
Joanne has chosen this song herself, 
for me, because she loves me. 

And the way she was playing it, 
so softly, so expressively, I could 
almost believe she did. It was not a 
matter of technical perfection — in 
fact, I had heard her play more cor- 
rectly. It was an emotional thing — 
the occasional uncertainty, hesitan- 
cy, only serving to heighten the 
spell — the endearing tremulousness 
of a young girl in love. She played it 
how it is. 

At last the slender fingers were 
still and she was finished. She was 
waiting for me to say something, 
but I didn’t know what to say. 

“Hello,” I murmured at last. 
“That was beautiful.” 

A pale shadow appeared within 
the light-absorbing semidome as 
she stood. She stepped forward and 
the room lighting fell upon her 
black hair, accentuating harshly 
the wrinkles about the eyes, the 
hard lines about the mouth. 

“Hello, Joe darling,” said Cari- 
oca Jones. “You never believed me 
when I said I could play.” 

Just for an instant the room 
seemed to shake itself about me 
and my stomach gave one single. 



great throb of horror and disgust. I 
turned away so that she couldn’t 
see the shock in my eyes and clutch- 
ed at the boxes on the table. 
Dumbly I handed the larger one to 
her. 

She took it in her young, soft 
hands and begart to undo the 
wrappings with little squeals of de- 
light, while I watched in fear, 
seeing the thin scars around her 
wrists . 

Dimly I heard Joanne’s voice be- 
hind me and dragged my gaze 
away. 

“Joe! How nice to see you again. 
Carioca tells me you’ve had a 
present made for me. You 
shouldn’t have, you know.” 

Joanne was walking across the 
room, smiling at me. then she 
turned and watched affectionately 
as Carioca went into transports of 
delight over the dress. Then she 
looked at me again. 

“Well, aren’t you going to give it 
to me?” 

Of course, I should have gues- 
sed. 1 should have known that 
Carioca would have a bonded S.P. 
girl, and I should have guessed that 
neither the friendless ex-star nor 
the female State Prisoner would ad- 
vertise the fact. But I could never 
have guessed the depths hero-wor- 
ship can reach. 

I was still clutching the small 
box. I suppose I must have blinked 
and half pulled myself together, 
tried to smile and offered it to her. 

Joanne reached to take it.

I don’t remember leaving the 
place or getting into the car. I 
remember being able to think 
again, to think slowly and begin to 
understand, somewhere in a sub- 
urb of Louise City — and how or 
why I got there I’ll never know. 

I stopped the car along the 
Marine Drive and looked out at the 
blackness of the evening sea. Some- 
thing caught my eye on the seat be- 
side me — it was Joanne’s present. 
Why should I blame her? 'The law 
gives a Freeman absolute rights 
over his bonded S.P. man — w'hich 
accounts for the popularity of 
dangerous sports, like sling- 
gliding. 

I found then I was watching a 
glider slipping quietly across the 
dark sky like a pale, swift bat. 
Somewhere a State Prisoner would 
be watching that tiny shape, too. 
He might be wishing the pilot dead, 
but he would never wish him 
injured. And I wondered just how 
badly Carioca’s hands had been 
bitten . 

There is a derogatory nickname 
for State Prisoners based on the 
initial letters — you seldom hear it 
but it came into my mind now. 

At least I’d had the wit to bring 
Joanne’s present away with me.

Past, Present and Future Perfect, 
Ed. Jack C. Wolf and Gregory 
Fitz Gerald 

H. G. Wells, Critic of Progress, 
by Jack Williamson 

Science Fiction Today and To- 
morrow, Ed. Reginald Bretnor 



W ELL, chillun, respectability 
has landslid upon us and it 
would seem that profound changes 
are taking place in the landscape. I 
suppose 1 could have seen it coming 
by all sorts of evidence — being 
asked to deliver commencement 
addresses, for example, and to 
speak at high schools and colleges, 
and then the offers to teach. 



1 write this at Penn State Univer- 
sity, during a four-day confer- 
ence of the Science Fiction Re- 
search Association, attended by 
writers and scholars from all over 
the country — and from some out- 
side it. Academe has embraced us 
profoundly and, I think, perma- 
nently, with as many shades and 
varieties of embrace as can be 
found in that other area. (An 
interesting analogy and one I think 
I’ll be pursuing as time goes on.) 

These teachers and professors 
and deans, these librarians and 
biog- and bibliographers take them- 
selves, and us, damn seriously. We 
writers are being studied and filed 
and annotated, our early influ- 
ences, active and passive, searched 
for, deduced, hypothesized and 
reported upon. We are becoming 



110 




the subjects of dissertations and 
seminars and whole shelves — pos- 
sibly whole library wings — will be 
devoted to us and our works. 

I arrived here with a brutally 
heavy suitcase, half filled with 
books and galleys in (I fear) a 
hopeless attempt to reach some- 
thing like deadline for this report 
to you. From here I’m off to Cor- 
nell for an all-university speech 
and a class, thence on to M.I.T. 
The head it spins. 

The logical, and beautiful, 
spearhead of the Penn State affair 
is Philip Klass, now a tenured pro- 
fessor in the English Department, 
clearly much loved and respected 
here, who is, as you surely know, 
none other than “our” William 
Tenn. Like many other sf writers, 
living ahead of his time he has 
sheltered within the ivy for seven 
years now and, though happy at 
this turn of events, is not in the 
least surprised. Here for the con- 
ference are Fred Pohl, Jack Wil- 
liamson (who was the deserved re- 
cipient of the Pilgrim Award for 
his scholastic contributions to sO, 
P. Schuyler Miller, Clifford Si- 
mak, James Gunn, Jerry Pournelle 
(president of SFWA), Gordon 
Dickson, Theodore Cogswell, Rog- 
er Zelazny, John Brunner and, 
from Australia, Bruce Gillespie. I 
won’t list the luminaries from 
Academe; take my word for it they 
outnumber the above four or five 
to one and, in their field, shine 
quite as brightly. One of them, just 



for example, is Pundit/Critic/ 
Author/ Professor Leslie Fiedler. 
The papers being read include 
scholarly dissections of Silverberg, 
Ellison, Heinlein, Simak, Clarke. 
Look at these solemn titles: “A 
Case of Conscience: Fiction and Re- 
ality.” “Themes of Arthur C. 
Clarke and Clifford D. Simak.” 
“Heinlein at 24 Frames per Sec- 
ond: Destination Moon Revisited.” 
“Quest for Unity: The Theme of 
the Whole Man in the Fiction of 
Robert Silverberg.” As well as 
many more general scholarly sur- 
veys: “Strange Parallels: 18th Cen- 
tury Attacks on the Novel and 
Modern Censure of Speculative 
Fiction,” and “Philosophical Limi- 
tations of Science Fiction.” 

It is a heady experience indeed 
to be so warmly accepted after so 
many decades of ghettoization and 
(in a way, even worse) amused 
tolerance. We must be grateful for 
the good of it, but we (that’s a 
group ‘we’, not an editorial or a 
royal one) can be forgiven for 
taking a good hard look at it. Are 
there writers who will begin to 
slant their stuff toward the scho- 
lars in the hope of getting recogni- 
tion? There are. Are there scholars 
whose prime interest in sf is not sf 
itself but a new, rich mother-lode 
for theses and papers and disserta- 
tions to help with the promotion 
and tenure game? There are. Are 
there text-book publishers so used 
to the panting eagerness of scho- 
lars to appear in print that they 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



111 




will try to get our stories for free or 
for a flat fee without royalties, the 
way they do the scholars’? You bet 
there are. Is respectability going to 
make us narrow, unleavened and 
pompous, as has happened to 
many classical musicians who have 
quite forgotten that the active verb 
in their profession is ‘play’? Could 
be. Some of us like to be pompous. 
In short: will the embrace smother 
us? 

I don’t think so. Above all, 
there’s just too much chutzpah in 
sf to permit of close containment. 
Should any important percentage 
of sf writers get lulled into the self- 
importance of the worst kind of 
scholasticism, their places will be 
instantly taken by younger and 
frothier blood who will operate 
outside the ivy — the off-Broadway 
phenomenon. And another point: it 
is already too late for any segment 
of Academia to claim us-i-English 
departments, for example. Phil 
Klass was recently a guest lecturer 
at an Eastern college at the 
invitation of the History Depart- 
ment, and I got a munificent offer 
last summer to be a Distinguished 
Professor in Residence at a West 
Coast college — from their Sociology 
Department. Sf is what it is 
because it won’t fit into anyone’s 
prebuilt box, and that’s not going 
to change. As for publishers, 
they’re going to find out abruptly 
that there is something, after all, in 
that much-scorned zap-gun, and 
we got’em. When in doubt about 



that permission request, get in 
touch with SFWA. 

For all that, it is good, really 
good, after all these thorny years, 
to get such warm recognition from 
so many intelligent, articulate and 
perceptive people. We walk in the 
front door now. Did you know that 
at the time of Mendelssohn, musi- 
cians were expected to use the 
servants’ entrance? 



ALREADY the Occasional drop into 
textbook country has turned 
into a trickle, and that stream will 
become a flood. Here’s a chunky 
(544 pp) little tome from Fawcett 
(regretfully, no pun intended) call- 
ed Past, Present and Future 
Perfect, subtitled “A Text Anthol- 
ogy of Speculative and Science 
Fiction”, edited by Jack C. Wolf 
and Gregory Fitz Gerald, of State 
University, Brockport, N.Y. 

It costs only 95e and is a damn 
good book. It has an unusual ar- 
rangement, starting with the pres- 
ent (Vonnegut, Graham Greene, 
Bradbury, B. F. Skinner and Asi- 
mov) and going back through 
public-domain country (Bierce, 
Wells, Mark Twain, Verne, Haw- 
thorne, Mary Shelley) to Swift, 
Voltaire, Cyrano, Francis Bacon, 
Lucian and Plato. And lots more — 
thirty or so titles and excerpts. The 
Introduction explains how to use it 
in the classroom, but nobody has 
to tell you how to enjoy it. It really 
is a Best Buy.

J ACK WILLIAMSON, 3s I men- 
tioned above, was given the 
Pilgrim Award at the SFRA con- 
ference for his contributions over a 
long and distinguished career of 
scholarship in science fiction. The 
old planet-smasher was an estab- 
lished giant in the field when a 
teen-aged Sturgeon crept timidly 
through the warehouse stacks at 
Street and Smith for a first terrify- 
ing meeting with John Campbell. 
His titles fill me, to this day, with 
nostalgia and excitement; Darker 
Than You Think, The Human- 
oids, The Legion of Space, the two 
Seetee books. The Reign of Wiz- 
ardry, The Humanoids, and dozens 
more. Meanwhile, as Professor of 
English at Eastern New Mexico 
University, he has earned his 
credentials in the academic world 
and, along with Robin Wilson, is 
the man most responsible for the 
institution of science fiction cours- 
es in colleges and universities 
(which, by the way, together with 
seminars and high-school courses, 
now number over four hundred!) 

An excellent example of what he 
got the Pilgrim Award for is H. G. 
Wells, Critic of Progress (The 
Mirage Press, Baltimore, 164 pp, 
annotated and indexed, $5.95.) 
and if you want one you’d better 
jump — the initial printing at this 
small, meticulous and devoted 
house was only 1500 copies. It is 
the most careful study of Wells I 
have ever seen, well thought-out 
and well written. The thrust of 



Williamson’s examination is that 
Wells, while dazzling his readers 
with his narrative deftness and the 
profligacy of his invention, was at 
the same time sternly pointing to 
nightmare. Before Orwell, before 
Zamiatin and Ayn Rand, Wells 
was warning us of the inevitable 
conflict between human freedom 
and mechanistically organized so- 
ciety. Williamson has made clear 
to me as never before that much of 
his work — more than I had ever 
realized and I was weaned on 
Wells — is cautionary. This book 
will be, I think, one of those 
cornerstone volumes in the struc- 
ture of sf archives — clear, careful, 
reliable. And even if your interest 
doesn’t run to the scholastic a run 
through this volume will greatly 
enhance a revisiting of Wells — and 
revisiting Wells is one of the nicest 
presents you can give yourself. 

R eginald bretnor is a scholar, 
a writer, a thinker, and very 
much a human being who, it is 
rumored, has actually met and 
talked with Ferdinand Feghoot. In 
1953 he published a prestigious 
tome. Modem Science Fiction, Its 
Meaning and its Future, which 
became and remains an absolute 
necessity for any scholar of this 
literary phenomenon with which 
ybu and I are entangled. Now 
comes Science Fiction, Today and 
Tomorrow (Harper and Rowe, 
$7.95, annotated and with bibliog- 
raphy) edited by Bretnor and

The beauty of this book — and it 
is beautiful — is that the editor. 



though he speaks his own piece 
and speaks it with force and 
clarity, made no demands on the 
rest of us to carry on his thesis — 
we had no inkling of his opinions 
before submitting our own. As a 
result you have here a true sym- 
posium, the unmodified expres- 
sion, facet by facet, of conviction 
and impression concerning a com- 
plex whole. A whole it indeed is, 
complex indeed it is and, inter- 
nally and externally, this book sets 
up many a conflict. I hope to see 
them fought out, too. Get this 
one — and/or see that your library 
acquires it. 

D uring the writing of the above 
I have moved from Penn State 
to and through Cornell and am 
now on the way to M.I.T. To re- 
inforce what I wrote above about 
the acceptance of sf in the ivied 
halls (some of them actually are, 
too, as if they had never heard of a 
clichel), it is interesting to point 
out that at Penn State I was the 
guest of the English Department; 
my sponsor at Cornell was the As- 
tronomy Department; and at 
M.I.T. I go at the behest of the 
Artificial Intelligence Lab. I have 
mentioned that Phil Klass spoke at 
Delaware not long ago at the invi- 
tation of the History Department 
and that it was Sociology that 
made me the bid out West. I can 
only be pleased for sf. If Academe 
wants us in a cubby-hole, it’s go- 
ing to have to build one. *

FRED SABERHAGEN 



^^T^ave decided to die,” Mat- 
Xthew Pandareus announced to 
his wife on their first evening to- 
gether after their long vacation trip 
to Mars. Actually they had been 
back on Earth for a week, but Iris 
had begun an evening class in the 
history of paperweights and they 
had not had a real chance to talk 
since their return. Tonight they had 
just finished dinner tete-a-tete in 
their condominium apartment and 
he had strolled from the dining al- 
cove to look out through the living 





room’s glass wall at the fantastic 
complexities of city lights extending 
below, around and above their 
middle-class, middle-level dwel- 
ling. 

“Dear, you had a similar idea 
once before, thirty years ago.” 
Iris’s clinging gown swished faintly 
about her shapely legs as she 
followed to stand slightly behind 
him at the window. “Here, you 
forgot your brandy.” 

“Thank you. Closer on forty,” he 
amended, turning to accept the 
glass from her hand. She turned 
away busily again as soon as she 
had passed it on and Pandareus 
had no very clear look at her face. 

Iris switched on the fireplace 
with a wave of her hand and adjust- 
ed the mood of the background 
music to something a little more 
capricious. “Thirty,” she said firm- 
ly, coming back to face him. The 
communication screen chimed then 
and she was off to answer it. Main- 
taining his stance in the living room 
Pandareus heard the short conver- 
sation — ^just some friends calling to 
welcome them back and ask how 
their voyage had been. Iris invited 
them over a week from Tuesday but 
they were busy that night. They 
would call again tomorrow or the 
next day and some date for a get- 
together would be worked out. 

Now she was back in the living 
room again, wearing an expression, 
he knew well, that of being firmly 
in the right though without ani- 
mosity for those who weren’t. 



“Thirty,” she said firmly. “It was 
right after you won the golf tourna- 
ment.” If it was time to argue. Iris 
was ready. Even studying her 
familiar face at close range, he 
could neither see nor remember 
which parts of it were synthetic skin 
and which her own, rejuvenated. 
There were no actual wrinkles on it 
anywhere, only the ghost of a line 
or two at the corners of the eyes. 
Even under close inspection she 
could be taken for a youthful twen- 
ty-eight. Her face and body were 
changing no more over the decades 
than were his golf or bowling score. 
He and Iris took long vacations 
from each other sometimes, but 
stayed married. He had found no 
one with whom he would rather 
live. 

‘‘It’s nearly a hundred years 
since we were married,” he recalled 
aloud and tasted his brandy. “Will 
you miss me very much?” 

“I shall miss you, of course. Our 
relationship has been — very nearly 
perfect. But if it will make you 
happy, Matthew, go ahead and die. 
What is it? Boredom?” 

“Not really.” He indicated with 
the most minimal inclination of his 
head, which Iris instantly interpret- 
ed correctly, that they might go and 
seat themselves near the fire. 
Stretching out his legs there in 
front of his chair, Pandareus con- 
tinued: “I think you know me well 
enough to believe that I am not 
trying to appear altruistic when I 
say that the time has come for me

to move on and make room for 
someone else.” 

“Of course, dearest.” 

“There are — what? — maybe ele- 
ven billion people on the planet 
now, and I think the number has 
hardly changed in the last few 
centuries. Fortunately starvation 
and disease are no longer problems. 
But it is a mixed blessing that 
practically no one dies unintention- 
ally any more — how can new lives 
be lived if the old will not make 
way? When was the last time you 
saw a child? If every — ” 

“Speaking of children,’’ Iris 
interrupted. “I don’t mean to 
interrupt, but speaking of children, 
I hope you’re not planning to have 
yourself terminated before the nine- 
teenth.” 

“Of what? This month?” Auto- 
matically he looked for a calendar 
but could not see one. “Why?” 
“Janet called.” His previous 
wife. “I mean, she left a message 
while we were on vacation. Things 
have been so hectic I forgot to tell 
you. Your five-great grandson is 
making his bar mitzvah on that 
date, you’re to be sure to attend.” 
“Bar mitzvah?” He rehearsed in 
his mind the names and genera- 
tions comprising the straight un- 
branching line of his descendants. 
“1 didn’t think Liang was Jewish.” 
“Perhaps what Janet meant was 
his confirmation. At any rate — ” 

“ — be sure to be there. Yes. 
Well, I had hoped to get away soon, 
having decided that it was the right 



move to make. But Janet would 
really feel hurt — if I know her. Is 
there any way we could get together 
with her, maybe this week or next 
week, and discuss it face to face? 
Let’s see, when — ” 

The communications screen 
chimed. Another set of friends, 
these just back from their own va- 
cation. 

T she next day in his office on 
the upper floor of the duplex 
apartment he consulted his busi- 
ness calendar as soon as he could 
find the time. He discovered there 
was no use after all in trying to get 
in touch with Janet and see her, be- 
cause even if the nineteenth were 
clear he had made commitments 
for important business meetings on 
the twenty-first and twenty-second. 
The firm in which he was a part- 
ner — dealers in antiques and folk 
art — was a small one and no great 
wealth hung on his decisions, but 
still an obligation was an obliga- 
tion. 

He switched his calendar to the 
following month. Studying the new 
pattern of appointments and mem- 
oranda displayed electronically on 
the glowing glass screen he at first 
found nothing in it that could not 
in good conscience be entrusted to 
his heirs and assigns. But wait, 
there was the antique furniture auc- 
tion in Minneapolis. Of course, he 
and Iris had gone to a great deal of 
trouble to plan their vacation so he 
would be sure to be back in time for 



CALENDARS

that. The auction would be an ideal 
chance for him to train one or two 
of the younger people in the firm as 
buyers and he supposed he owed it 
to his partners to carry on that far. 

Now, the month after that ... of 
course, he was supposed to be in 
Europe for the round of trade 
shows. Again, the feeling that he 
would be letting others down if he 
bowed out. His wife might have a 
chance to go along. She also 
wanted to take part of the history 
study group that she was heading — 
all adults, of course — to Europe. 

The next month, now, was all 
clear, except for trivia that he could 
disregard if he put his mind to it. 
He did put his mind to it. Then 
with his electronic stylus he wrote 
TERMINATION across that month on 
the calendar screen. 

That evening, however, after 
helping Iris grade papers from her 
drama group before some friends 
came over, he paused suddenly 
with a foodbar halfway to his 
mouth, staring after his wife who 
had just vanished into the kitchen 
to start preparing the drinks and 
smokes and slices and dip. He had 
just been struck by the realization 
that the month he had tentatively 
chosen for his demise was the 
month of their hundredth anniver- 
sary. He had been deliberately 
keeping his calendar for that 
month clear of other major events, 
never dreaming that he could forget 
the big one. 

Of course, they could have some 



worthy celebration (was it on the 
fifteenth or the sixteenth?) and 
then he could terminate a few days 
later — but no. The scene would be 
very awkward. He could hear the 
questions now: And what are you 
and your husband doing to cele- 
brate, my dear? And the good 
wishes: May the next hundred years 
be as happy as the first. No, any 
time that month would definitely be 
too close. 

He would have to ask Iris how 
she felt about it. But there was the 
door and the bridge club was 
starting to arrive. 

1 1 HE NEXT day Pandareus had 
his lawyer on the screen — they 
were locked in a time-consuming 
squabble with another art dealer 
over the correct attribution of an 
early-American painting — and he 
took the opportunity to discuss the 
legal aspects of dying. 

The lawyer shook his head. 
“Haven’t time to go into -the whole 
thing right now. But it’s not 
advisable for you to terminate at 
present. You’d do much better to 
wait until after the first of the year. 
The tax structure . .’’ Pandareus 
had to cut the call short a minute 
later and hurry out to meet a poten- 
tial big customer for lunch — so he 
managed to gain no very clear 
understanding of the tax structure. 
But he had become convinced that 
dying before the first of the year 
was financially inadvisable.

His first feeling was actually one 
of relief. This enforced delay would 
give him a breathing space in which 
to plan calmly for an exit that 
would have some dignity and 
perhaps even a touch of ceremony 
about it. But in his heart he knew 
that if you let projects slide long 
enough it was difficult to get back 
to them. Tomorrow, he promised 
himself, he would try to set up a 
termination date as soon after the 
first of the year as possible. 

When he came down from the 
office that night — later than he had 
planned — he found Iris sprawled 
on the sofa, her shoes off. 

She greeted him with a faint wel- 
coming cry. “Ahh! Come rub my 
feet. I have had a day, Matthew, 
the story of which you will hardly be 
inclined to believe.” 

“That conference on endangered 
virus species?” 

“That was yesterday. No, I went 
shopping this morning and this 
afternoon 1 had to go see that place 
where we were planning to store our 
boat next winter — remember, you 
were too busy to go?” 

“Oh, yes.” He sat on the sofa 
and began to rub a foot, squeezing 
the arch and instep with an expert 
touch. “Join me in a drink?” 
“Gladly. And that was only the 
start. From the boat storage estab- 
lishment I had to go — ” 

The communicator screen chim- 
ed. The caller was the computer 
service company, reminding them 
that their home terminals were to 



be disconnected for a day’s mainte- 
nance tomorrow. 

AFTER dinner — and after Iris had 
gone wearily to bed — he drag- 
ged himself with proud determina- 
tion up the stairs to his office again. 
Jaw outthrust, he set himself to 
decide firmly once and for all — in- 
sofar as such decision might be pos- 
sible for one man aided by com- 
puter — the year, month and day 
upon which his life would end. He 
dropped into the chair before his 
desk with a sigh, brushed aside the 
printouts, accumulated during din- 
ner, of Antique Dealer’s Bulletin 
and five other periodicals he never 
had time to read. He punched for a 
combined full printout, on micro- 
tape, of his business and social 
calendars for the next twelve 
months. Next year’s vacation, for 
example, had been arranged that 
far in advance. He and Iris were 
planning to go back to Indonesia, 
where they had not visited for sixty 
years. He took his tired mind firmly 
in hand. Forget about seeing 
Indonesia again. 

While riding the tubeliner to 
Boston to attend a class reunion he 
finished other tasks in time to put 
the calendar microtape into a pro- 
jector and begin work on the prob- 
lem. Scanning back over the print- 
out — chronologically from the 
scheduled vacation — setting his 
mind in as ruthless a frame as pos- 
sible, he mentally pruned out an 
underbrush of minor appointments. 



CALENDARS 



119 




celebrations and entertainments 
planned from a sense of social duty. 
With his finger gliding on the 
projected image of the microtape 
he drew the surcease of eternity 
closer and ever closer to the 
hurtling moment of the present in 
which he dwelt. 

“Would you care for a cocktail, 
sir?” 

“No, thank you.” He could have 
used one, but, nagged by the ur- 
gency of finishing before they got to 
Boston or probably not at all in the 
immediate future, he stuck with his 
work. Four months nearer to his 
present, moving anti-clockward 
from next year’s vacation, his 
finger stopped, having run into the 
notable barrier of the annual ban- 
quet of the Old Marrieds’ Club, for 
which he and Iris had standing re- 
servations.. Yes. That would set a 
time. Attend the banquet, drop- 
ping to a few old friends broad 
hints that he would not be back 
next year, delay a decent month 
and then bow out. 

He straightened in his seat, 
turned off the projector and slid it 
back into its travel case. Settled, 
and they were just pulling into 
Boston. Once in a while things 
worked out just right. 

O N THE day he got home from 
the reunion he began trying to 
get in touch with his physician. It 
was a few days before the doctor, 
repeatedly trying to return his call, 
did so at a moment when Pandareus 



was available. Communication es- 
tablished, Pandareus promptly 
asked for and was given the name 
of another doctor, who had done 
terminations for several other 
people. 

“There aren’t any real specia- 
lists,” his own doctor assured Pan- 
dareus. “Not in the field you want. 
Not enough people are having it 
done. How about a round of golf on 
Wednesday?” 

“Can’t,” said Pandareus auto- 
matically and then consulted his 
calendar to make sure of why. “My 
father’s coming into town that day. 
Maybe next week?” 

The doctor looked off screen, evi- 
dently checking his own calendar, 
and frowned. “I’ll try to call you 
back on it. You’ll like Dr. James. 
One of the best men in the city.” 
“Thanks.” 

“Right.” 

Pandareus broke the connection 
and punched for Dr. James. A busy- 
signal. Well, he would try calling in 
the afternoon, before the time came 
to leave for the matinee. 

Eventually he got through. “Dr. 
James’s office,” a receptionist of 
timeless prettiness told him. 

“How do you do. I’d like to make 
an appointment to talk to the 
doctor, or talk to him right now if 
that’s feasible. It’s regarding my 
contemplated termination.” 

“I see, sir.” Even before taking 
his name she asked, “And when is 
your preferred date for termina- 
tion?” 



120 



GALAXY 




He told her. 

The receptionist was gently, ex- 
quisitely concerned. “I’m sorry, sir, 
but Dr. James will be on vacation 
that month.” 



B ut he persevered. Iris helped a 
lot. Seated with her in an aircab 
on his way at last to Dr. James’s 
office to be terminated, he looked 
back on the months since his first 
firm decision to die and found the 
time, as viewed from his present 
angle, to be almost disconcertingly 
short. 

Iris, riding beside him, was tired. 
She held an envelope containing 
some of the necessary papers, 
which they had only just managed 
to have signed in time, this very 
morning. “Oh, God, I’m dead,” 
she murmured without thinking, 
and then looked over at him with 
alarm. “That was thoughtless of 
me, wasn’t it?” 

“Not at all, my dear. I won’t be 
easily upset today. I feel happy. 
Completed. Fulfilled. A successful 
race run, a well-earned rest ahead, 
as it were. I want you to share my 
joy.” 

“I do, Matthew.” But a little 
movement about the lips and 
throat, a tiny lift of the head, coun- 
terbalanced all the happy intona- 
tions she was putting into her voice. 
She was trying her best to act as if 
nothing were wrong, but after a 
little more than a hundred years he 
could infallibly tell when something 



out of the ordinary was bothering 
her. 

“Iris, what are your plans for the 
immediate future? I really haven’t 
had time to discuss it with you.” 
“I’d like to get away for a while, 
Matthew. But I don’t see how I 
can . My desensitivity training group 
begins to meet next week. And 
there will be any number of loose 
ends to tidy up regarding your de- 
parture.” 

“Something more is bothering 
you. I can tell. Are you going to 
miss me too much, after all?” 
“No, dear. If your absence 
affects me unduly I will just think 
of you as being on a long trip 
somewhere. And keep busy.” 

He pressed her hand. “But there 
is something. I insist on hearing 
what it is. It is most unfair to 
conceal things from me at this junc- 
ture.” 

“Matthew, I am not going to 
interfere with your happy depar- 
ture. You have put so much time 
and effort into arranging it. Into 
making an achievement of your 
whole life. To — to close it proper- 
ly, like a good poem.” 

“Something is definitely wrong 
and you are going to tell me what it 
is. Or I will stop the cab until you 
do.” 

Iris put down the bulky envelope 
and looked for a tissue. “You have 
nothing to regret. You have cer- 
tainly been a good husband to me. 
You have kept almost every prom- 
ise you ever made.” 



CALENDARS 



121 




Aha. “What promise or promises 
have 1 failed to keep?” 

“I have really nothing to com- 
plain of, Matthew.” 

The airborne cab glided to a soft 
waiting halt on the roof of the 
building housing Dr. James’s office, 
but neither of the passengers got 
out at once. Pandareus had to spar 
through another verbal round or 
two with his wife before the reason 
for her unhappiness was clear. 

“It was more than ninety years 
ago, Matthew, and I am sure you 
have forgotten it. But early in our 
marriage you did promise me that 
one day we would have a child.” 

H e closed his eyes for a mo- 
ment. Recollection ofthe prom- 
ise had been coming back hazily, 
subconsciously, for some indeter- 
minate time. Perhaps she had been 
dropping hints, trying to remind 
him. Anyway, there was no real 
surprise in hearing about the 
promise now and he could not 
honestly deny that it had been 
made. An obligation was an obliga- 
tion and he had several times 
already put off dying for lesser ones 
than this. This was rather more im- 
portant than a five-great grandson’s 
confirmation, he supposed. 

“Iris, do you really think we have 
the right to bring a new life into the 
world?” 

“Oh, Matthew, the world can 
certainly support one more, with 
hydrogen-fusion power and recla- 



mation and all the rest. An equili- 
brium has been reached. It’s not as 
if everyone were reproducing; I was 
reading just the other day how re- 
markable it is that so few exercise 
their legal rights to do so. The 
author was wondering why. And 
even if you did father a child once 
before — I’ve never had one. I don’t 
think people are going to com- 
ment.” 

“I suppose not.” He gave his wife 
the ghost of a smile, let his hand 
hang in the air for a moment and 
then signaled decisively for the cab 
to open its door. “Just let me step 
into James’s office and let them 
know there’s been a change of 
plan.” 

“Oh, Matthew! How loving of 
you to do this for me.” She gripped 
his fingers and looked into his eyes 
intently. “You must understand, 
having a child will mean that your 
presence as a father is required for 
an indefinite period. The child will 
need you psychologically. It will 
mean years added to your life.” 

“I’ve been through it all before, 
remember?” He kissed her on the 
cheek. “The decision is made. I’ll 
be right back.” 

But he was gone quite a long 
time, and she began to worry. 
Suppose he had — but no, there he 
was, looking a little happier than 
when he left, reaching briskly for 
the cab’s door. 

“James was pretty good about it 
all,” Pandareus said, getting in. 
“But my change of mind meant

there were more forms to be filled 
out and we’ll have to check back 
with city hall, the crematorium and 
the lawyers and — ” He broke off to 
snap his fingers with irritation. “I 
meant to ask James if he could put 
us in touch with a good — what 
d’you call ’em? — obstetrician. Doc- 
tor who oversees gestation. And 
also one of those hospitals where 
they have an artificial womb. 
Those’re supposed to be much 
improved these days.” 

Iris was relaxed now, content 
and comfortable. “Oh, no, Mat- 
thew. It was on television just the 
other day that artificial wombs are 
being discontinued once again. 
Even the new models had too many 
drawbacks.” 

Pandareus gave the cab its new 
orders and leaned back beside' his 
wife as it took off and promptly 
became stuck in a traffic jam at the 
five-hundred-meter aerial level. 
“Then you’ll just have to go 
through the whole nine months of 
inconvenience and the big disabling 
trauma at the end. I went through 
it all with Janet.” He shook his 
head and smiled a little. “It’s going 
to take some planning. Well, if it 
will make you happy, dear. When 
do you want to have the baby? Get 
it started, I mean?” 

“Let’s see.” Then Iris’s forehead 
almost creased with a pretty frown 
of light vexation. “Oh, dear. If we 
got baby started right now he’d be 
born just when our vacation trip is 
on. Let’s see — ” *

Peace came to Earth — but 
who was left to care? 

JACK B. KERR 




J ULY 4, 1987, and John Brinn is 
working overtime again. In spite 
of the Q-Systems Air Conditioning 
in the computer room he is uncom- 
fortable. This assignment is plush 
by most standards, but being alone 
is getting to him. He has 3 x 10^ 
movies to choose from and the Auto- 
matic Menu System puts out any- 
thing from a hotdog to gourmet 
food — if it is in the AMS program. 
Sometimes he wishes that the menu 
included peanut butter and mayon- 
naise sandwiches, but what dietician 
would put those in a program? The 
game room has everything including 
the automatic playback pingpong 
table. He can now beat it on System 
Three and he can give it a good 
game on System Four. Sometimes, 
just for fun, he sets it all the way to 
System Ten to watch the balls spin 
at fantastic angles from the return. 
Some of them corkscrew all the way 
across the room. He never has been 
able to return even one shot. 

The best relaxation of all is when 
the UN-7 computer is on Mode 9 and 
he can go outside to lie on the beach 
and listen to the surf. Those waves 
are really something. No program- 
ing them or their sequence. They are 
always the same but always differ- 
ent. Sometimes they seem to be talk- 
ing to him, telling him that all this 
will change but the sea will remain. 

For weeks now he has been getting 
erratic answers from the computer, 
and that worries him. When the 
United Nations decided to put UN-7 
into a safe place they compared loca- 



124 





tions all over the globe and selected 
this island for its freedom from pos- 
sible earthquakes, tidal waves, 
hurricanes and solar wind problems. 

UN-5 had been in Geneva to be 
free from war, but the Spitzmark 
Revolution stirred up so much vio- 
lence that it was damaged and 
repairs could not be completed for 
five weeks. That almost ruined 
everything because UN-5, although 
primitive, controlled the world 
supply and distribution of energy. 
UN-6 was hurried to completion on 
Sandoval in the Pacific, but an 
underwater volcano did that one in. 
Fortunately UN-6 predicted its own 
death early enough for the United 
Nations to find this rock and build 
UN-7. 

John had interned on UN-5 and 
had been AMZ Director on UN-6. 
When Rolley retired after the instal- 
lation and testing of UN-7, he was 
offered this post and jumped at the 
chance. Now in the middle of his 
four-year term he is getting deviant 
feedback from major terminals 
around the world. 

He had requested Master Pro- 
gramer Assistance from the UN days 
ago but could get no clear response. 
The UN outbound line tested — and 
still tests — alive from this end and 
none of the redundant UN circuits 
cut in on Auto 3. He had overridden 
the Master and introduced the R 
Circuit to UN, but still he received 
garbled data. He was sure that they 
must understand the difficulty, for 
with trouble at this level there would 



be major conflicts in scheduling of 
airline travel, freight train and barge 
traffic. There would also be some 
disruption in the atmospheric distri- 
bution of electrical energy. When 
that happened the minor terminals, 
usually India and Malaysia, really 
griped to UN Master although they 
suffered less than the major ter- 
minals. 

He had sent a General Program 
Problem Report to all terminals and 
had included a Major Malfunction 
and Time Ration Schedule. This 
had gone out two days ago and the 
Repeat-Acknowledge Response 
Analysis readout had indicated that 
it had been received in 137 of the 623 
Specific Outlet Terminals. The local 
repeaters would pass this along to 
UN Master — he should have receiv- 
ed inbound analysis yesterday. 
Since it did not arrive, there must be 
a major disturbance. UN-7 itself 
could not locate the trouble. Its 
internal analysis reported: 

ALL CIRCUITS OK**MAJOR 
TERMINALS NOT RESPONDING . 

What was wrong? There were no 
major earthquakes, no atmospheric 
disturbances, only one war and at 
last Summary Analysis from UN to 
all terminals it was reported localiz- 
ed along the China-Russia border. 

B oth of these major terminals 
had Laser C and both were re- 
ported to have Earth Magnet Direc- 
tional Guidance capability. If true, 
this meant either could direct the 
Laser C beam along any of Earth’s 



WAVES 



125 




magnetic lines and wipe out any- 
thing in its path from magnetic pole 
to magnetic pole and from ground 
level to 75.374 meters above mean 
sea level. Power requirements to do 
this would be outrageous, but both 
China and the Russians could power 
the C beam'for a total of 3° of mag- 
netic line in increments of 0.2837°. 
Such use of power would require 
complete blackouts of energy within 
the nation and would be immediate- 
ly noted by UN-7 and be condemned 
by the United Nations through 
United Nations Master. At that 
point, input energy to the offending 
terminals would be suspended, thus 
putting to an end the use of Laser C 
and any other major energy use. 

The use of Laser C with EMDG 
would cause continuous destruction 
from magnetic pole to magnetic 
pole along the chosen line. This was 
the reason that the United Nations 
finally agreed to limit the manufac- 
ture of Laser C producing equip- 
ment. The use of this ultimate wea- 
pon could cause unconscionable de- 
struction to nonwarring nations who 
happened to lie along the unlucky 
magnetic line. 

But. Suppose each nation started 
to draw power from World Energy? 
Suppose some of the erratic readings 
had been because each nation start- 
ed this withdrawal and their termi- 
nals spotted the other’s withdrawal. 
Suppose each had wired around its 
outbound terminal trunk to hide 
this withdrawal, but by spying or su- 
perior programing found out about 



the plans at the other terminal? 
Suppose each fired at the other’s 
capital. and Laser base, or one fired 
first and the other’s Dead-Fire cir- 
cuits fired back? Then the capital 
terminal would be wiped out. If the 
wire-arounds were in the Laser base 
buried deep in the ground below 
mean sea level and were untouched, 
they could continue to draw energy 
and fire again and again, cutting 
across 3° of the Earth’s longitude 
per day per country. Firing on a pro- 
gramed schedule until all of the 
other country was wiped out and/or 
until the other’s Laser Surface 
Reflector was destroyed. If one laser 
were destroyed the other would (or 
could) continue to blast for as long

WHA THAS GONE BEFORE 

Helward Mann of Earth City has 
reached manhood at the age of six 
hundred and fifty miles. His age is 
reckoned by the city's progress to- 
ward the Optimum — e.g. from the 
moment of Helward’s birth Earth 
City has traveled six hundred and 
fifty miles toward this elusive goal, 
a process of which Helward knows 
little or nothing. His early years, 
spent in the creche with other city 
children, have been sheltered. His 
education has been Earth oriented 
and has given him little informa- 
tion about the planet the city now 
traverses. 

Following elaborate rites wel- 
coming him to adulthood — at 
which Helward elects to become an 
apprentice of the Future Surveyors' 
Guild and his engagement to a girl 
named Victoria Lerouex is an- 
nounced — Helward is permitted to 
see his first sunrise, actually his 
first glimpse of the outside. As- 
signed to serve his initial term as an 
apprentice with the Trackmen's 
Guild, he discovers that the city 
moves forward across the planet's 
surface on rails painstakingly laid 
ahead of it and as painstakingly 
removed once they have served 
their purpose (a) to prevent the 
city's sliding backward and (b) to 
be reused. He also learns that the 
city is fusion- powered and is the 
sole source of the good life on the 
planet — it alone has adequate (if 
tasteless and synthetic) food, cloth- 
ing medical and educational facili- 
ties. It uses these to barter for 



workers and women to bear 
children — of which it has a short- 
age — from among primitive tribes 
of aliens or “tooks" en route. The 
women acquired by barter remain 
in the city long enough to bear a 
child to a city male, are then 
returned to their tribes. 

The knowledge of how the city 
came to be is lost. It is, however, 
known that somehow it originated 
on Earth and that, in order to sur- 
vive, it must be winched constantly 
toward the Optimum, which moves 
ahead of it. Instructions to this ef- 
fect are contained in a document 
known as Destain’s Directive, 
handed down from the city's 
founder in some dim antiquity. 
Ideally the city should progress 
at the rate of one- tenth of a mile a 
day. This pace, however, is never 
maintained — there is uneven ter- 
rain to contend with; rivers and 
gorges must be bridged. The city 
has never been closer than three 
miles to the Optimum, This, 
however, is enough to keep it alive 
and functioning. 

There is discontent both within 
and outside the city. Helward ex- 
periences both. Victoria, whom he 
has married, finds her life in urban 
confinement pointless, Helward 
has taken an apprentice's oath 
never to discuss the outside or the 
city's relationship to it with the un- 
initiated under penalty of death. To 
save his marriage, however, he 
breaks his vow in conversations 
with Victoria. He also is involved 
and injured in a riot of resentful 
“took"' workers.

VIII 

I SLEPT uncomfortably that night. 

Alone in the hut, I undressed 
carefully and looked at the damage. 
One side of my chest was a mass of 
bruises and there were several deep 
and painful scratches. The wound 
on my neck had stopped bleeding, 
but I washed it in warm water and 
put on it some ointment I found in 
Malchuskin’s first-aid box. I discov- 
ered that in the fight one of my 
fingernails had been badly torn and 
my jaw ached when I tried to move 
it. 

I thought again about returning 
to the city as Collings had 
suggested — it was, after all, only a 
matter of a few hundred yards 
away — but in the end thought better 
of it. I had no wish to draw attention 
to myself by appearing in the sterile, 
clean surroundings of the city 
looking as if I had just come out of a 
drunken brawl. The truth wasn’t 
too far from that, but even so I 
thought I would lick my own 
wounds. 

I tried to sleep, only managing to 
doze off for a few minutes at a time. 

In the morning I was awake early 
and got up. I didn’t wish to see Mal- 
chuskin before I had had a chance 
to clean myself up further. My 
whole body ached and I could move 
only slowly. 

When he arrived, Malchuskin 
was in a bad mood. 

“I heard,” he said straight away. 
“Don’t try to explain.” 



“1 can’t understand what hap- 
pened.” 

“You were instrumental in start- 
ing a brawl.” 

“It was the militia — ” I said 
weakly. 

“Yes, and you ought to know by 
now that you keep the militia away 
from the tooks. They lost a few men 
some miles back and there are a few 
scores to settle. Any excuse and 
those stupid bastards go in and start 
clubbing.” 

“Collings was in trouble,” I said. 
“Something had to be done 
quickly.” 

“All right, it wasn’t entirely your 
fault. Collings says now that he 
could have handled it if you hadn’t 
brought the militia in — but he also 
admits that he told you to fetch 
them.” 

“That’s right.’’ 

“All right. But think, next time.” 

“What do we do now?” I said. 
“We’ve no laborers.” 

“There are more coming today. 
The work will go slowly at first, be- 
cause we’ll have to train them for it. 
But the advantage is that the resent- 
ments won’t start at once and they’ll 
work harder. It’s later, when they 
get time to add things up, that the 
trouble begins.” 

“But why do they resent us? 
Surely, we pay them for their 
services.” 

“Yes, but at our price. This is a 
poor region. The soil’s bad and 
there’s not much food. We pass by 
in our city, offer them what they 



INVERTED WORLD 



129 




need — and they take it. But they get 
no long-term benefit, and I suppose 
we take more than we give.” 

“We should give more.” 

“Maybe.” Malchuskin looked 
indifferent. “That’s none of our 
concern. We work the track.” 

We had to wait several hours for 
the new men to arrive. During that 
time Malchuskin and 1 went to the 
dormitory huts vacated by the 
workers and cleaned them out. The 
earlier occupants had been hustled 
away by the militiamen during the 
night, but they had been given time 
to collect their belongings. They had 
left a lot, though — mainly old and 
worn garments and scraps of food. 
Malchuskin warned me to keep an 
eye open for any kind of message 
that might have been left for the new 
men, but neither he nor I discovered 
anything of this sort. 

Later we went outside and burned 
anything that had been left. 

Around midday a man from the 
Barter guild came to us and said 
that the new laborers would be with 
us shortly. We were made a formal 
apology about what had happened 
the previous evening and told that in 
spite of much discussion it had been 
decided that the militia guard would 
be strengthened for the time being. 
Malchuskin protested, but the Bar- 
ter guildsman could only agree — 
the decision had been taken against 
his own opinion. 

I was in two minds about this. 
On the one hand I had no great ad- 
miration for the militiamen, but if 



their presence could avert a repeti- 
tion of the trouble I supposed it was 
necessary. 

Malchuskin was beginning to fret 
about the delay. I presumed that 
this was because of the constant 
need to make up lost time, but when 
1 mentioned this he was not as 
concerned about moving on as I’d 
thought. 

“We’ll make time on the opti- 
mum on the next winching,” he 
said. “The delay last time was 
because of the ridge. That’s behind 
us now and the land’s fairly level 
ahead of us for the next few miles. 
I’m more concerned about the state 
of the track still left behind the 
city.” 

“The militia will be protecting 
it,” I said. 

“Yes, but they can’t stop it from 
buckling. That’s the main risk, the 
longer it’s left.” 

“Why?” 

Malchuskin looked at me sharp- 
ly. “We’re a long way south of 
optimum. You know what that 
means?” 

“No.” 

“You haven’t been down past 
yet?” 

“What does that mean?” 

“A long way south of the city.” 

“No, I haven’t.” 

“Well, when you go down there 
you’ll find out what happens. In the 
meantime, take my word for it. The 
longer we leave the track laid south 
of the city, the more risk there is of 
it’s becoming unusable.” 



130 



GALAXY 




T here was still no sign of the 
hired men and Malchuskin left 
me and went over and spoke to two 
more Track guildsmen who had just 
come out of the city. In a while he 
returned. 

“We’ll wait another hour and if 
no one’s come by then we’ll borrow 
some men from one of the other 
guilds and start work. We can’t wait 
any longer.’’ 

“Can you do that, use other 
guilds?’’ 

“Hired men are a luxury, Hel- 
ward,’’ he said. “In the past the 
track-laying was done by guildsmen 
alone. Moving the city’s the main 
priority and nothing stands in the 
way. If we had to we’d have everyone 
in the city out here laying track.” 
Suddenly he seemed to relax. He 
stretched out on the ground and 
closed his eyes. The sun was almost 
directly overhead and it seemed 
hotter than usual. I noticed that in 
the northwest hung a line of dark 
clouds and that the air felt stiller 
and more humid than normally. 

A few minutes later Malchuskin 
sat up and looked northward. 
Coming toward us was a large band 
of men, led by five of the Barter 
guildsmen wearing their regalia of 
cloaks and colors. 

“Good — now we start work,” 
said Malchuskin. 

In spite of his barely concealed 
relief there was much that had to be 
done before work could begin. The 
men had to be organised into four 
groups and an English-speaking 



one appointed leader. Then bunks 
had to be allotted in the huts and 
possessions stowed away. Malchus- 
kin looked optimistic throughout all 
this. 

“They’re looking hungry,” he 
said. “Nothing like an empty belly 
to keep them working.” 

They were indeed a disheveled 
lot. They all had clothes of sorts but 
very few had any shoes and most 
wore their hair and beards long. 
Their eyes were sunk deep and sev- 
eral sported stomachs swollen from 
lack of proper food. I noticed that 
one or two walked with discomfort 
and one had a mutilated arm. 

“Are they fit to work?” I asked 
Malchuskin quietly. 

“Not properly. But a few days of

work and a proper diet, and they’ll 
be okay. A lot of tooks look like this 
when we first hire them.” 

I was shocked by the condition 
they were in and reflected that the 
local standard of living must be as 
bad as Malchuskin had made out. If 
this were so I could better under- 
stand the *way resentment grew 
against the people of the city. I 
supposed that what the-city gave in 
return for the laborers was a long 
way beyond what they were gener- 
ally accustomed to and this gave 
them a glimpse of a better-fed, more 
comfortable life. As the city passed 
on they would have to revert to their 
former primitive existence, the city 
meanwhile having taken of the 
people’s best. 

More delays, as the men were 
given food, but Malchuskin was 
looking more optimistic than ever. 

Finally we were ready to begin. 
The men formed themselves into 
four groups, each headed by a 
guildsman. We set off for the city, 
collected the four track bogies and 
headed south down the tracks in 
grand style. To each side of the rails 
the militiamen continued their 
guard and as we crossed the ridge we 
saw that down in the valley we had 
recently vacated there was a strong 
guard around the track buffers. 

M alchuskin stopped the bogie 
a short distance before the 
buffer and explained to the group 
leader — a middle-aged man named 
Juan — what had to be done. Juan 



relayed this to the men and they 
nodded their understanding. 

“They haven’t the vaguest idea 
what they’ve got to do,” Malchuskin 
said to me, chuckling. “But they’ll 
pretend to understand. 

The first task was to dismantle 
the buffer and move it up the tracks 
to a position just behind the city. 
Malchuskin and I had only just 
started to demonstrate how the 
buffer was dismantled when the sun 
went in abruptly and the tempera- 
ture dropped. 

Malchuskin glanced up at the 
sky. “We’re in for a storm.” 

After this remark he paid no more 
attention to the weather and we con- 
tinued with the work. A few minutes 
later we heard the first distant 
grumble of thunder and a short 
while after that the rain began to 
fall. The hired men looked up in 
alarm, but Malchuskin kept them 
going. Soon the storm was on top of 
us, the lightning flashing and the 
thunder cracking in a way that terri- 
fied me. We were all soon drenched, 
but the work continued. I heard the 
first complaints, but Malchuskin — 
through Juan — stilled them. 

As we were taking the component 
parts of the buffer back up the track 
the storm cleared and the sun came 
out again. One of the men began to 
sing and soon the others joined in. 
Malchuskin looked happy. The 
day’s work finished with erecting 
the buffer a few yards behind the 
city. The other crews also stopped 
work when they had built theirs. 



132 



GALAXY 




The next day we started early. 
Malchuskin still looked happy but 
expressed his desire to get on with 
the work as fast as we could. 

As we tried to take up the 
southernmost part of the track, I 
saw at first hand the cause of his 
worry. The tie-bars holding the rails 
to the sleepers had bent, and had to 
be wrenched away manually. Most 
became mangled beyond re-use. 
Too, the pressure of the tie-bars 
against the sleepers had split the 
wood in many places — though Mal- 
chuskin declared they could be 
used again — and many of the con- 
crete foundations had cracked. 
Fortunately the rails themselves 
were still in a usable condition. Al- 
though Malchuskin said they had 
buckled slightly, he reckoned they 
could be straightened again without 
too much difficulty. He held a brief 
conference with the other Track 
guild smen and it was decided to 
dispense with the use of the bogies 
for the moment and concentrate on 
digging up the track before any 
more of it became distorted. As it 
was still some two miles between 
where we were working and the city, 
each journey in the bogie took a long 
time and this decision made sense. 

By the end of that day wt had 
worked our way up the track to a 
point where the buckling effect was 
only beginning to be felt. Malchus- 
kin and the others declared them- 
selves satisfied. We loaded the 
bogies with as many of the rails and 
the sleepers as they would hold, and 



then we called a halt again. 

And so the track labors con- 
tinued. By the time my ten-day 
period came to an end, the 
track-removal was well advanced. 
The hired men were working well as 
teams and already the new track to 
the north of the city was being laid. 
When I left Malchuskin he was as 
contented as 1 had ever seen him 
and I felt not in the least guilty 
about taking my two days’ leave. 

IX 

V '’ icTORiA was waiting for me in 
her room. By this time the 
bruises and scratches from the 
fracas had mostly healed and I had 
decided to say nothing of it. Word of 
the scuffle had evidently not 
reached her, for she did not ask me 
about it. 

After leaving Malchuskin’s hut in 
the morning I had walked to the 
city, enjoying that early part of the 
morning before it became too hot, 
and now I suggested to Victoria that 
we go up to the platform. 

“I think it’ll be locked at this time 
of day,” she said. “I’ll go see.” 

She was gone for a few minutes, 
then returned to confirm that this 
was so. 

“I suppose it’ll be open some time 
after midday,” I said, thinking that 
by then the sun would have passed 
from the view of the platform. 

“Take off your clothes,” she said. 
“They need laundering again.” 

I started to undress but suddenly 



INVERTED WORLD 



133 




Victoria came over to me and put 
her arms around me. We kissed, 
spontaneously realizing that we 
were pleased to see each other. 

“You’re putting on weight,” she 
said as she slipped the shirt from my 
shoulders and ran her hand lightly 
across my chest. 

“It’s all the work I’m doing,” I 
said and began to unbutton her 
clothes. 

As a consequence of this change 
in our plans it wasn’t until some 
time later that Victoria took my 
clothes away to be laundered, 
leaving me to enjoy the comforts of a 
proper bed. 

After we had eaten some lunch we 
discovered that the way to the 
platform was now open and so we 
moved up there. This time we were 
not alone — two men from the Edu- 
cation administration were there be- 
fore us. They recognized us both 
from our days in the creche and soon 
we were involved in a bland conver- 
sation about what we had been do- 
ing since coming of age. From 
Victoria’s expression I gathered 
that she was as bored as I was with 
this, but neither of us liked to make 
a move to finish it. 

In due course the men bade us 
farewell and returned to the interior 
of the city. 

Victoria winked at me, then 
giggled. “God, I’m glad we’re not 
still in the creche,” she said. 

“So am I. And I thought they 
were interesting when they were 
teaching us.” 



We sat down together on one of 
the seats and looked out across the 
landscape. From this part of the city 
it was not possible to see what was 
happening immediately at the side 
of the city, and even though I knew 
the track crews would be carting 
rails from the southern side to the 
north, it was not possible to see 
them. 

“Helward — why does the city 
move?” 

“I don’t know. Not exactly, 
anyway.” 

She said, “I don’t know what the 
guilds imagine we think about this. 
No one ever says anything about it, 
though one has only to come up here 
to see the city has moved. And yet if 
you ask anyone about it you’re told 
it’s not the concern of an adminis- 
trator. Are we not supposed to ask 
questions?” 

“They tell you nothing?” 

“Nothing at all. A couple of days 
ago I came up here and discovered 
that the city had moved. A few days 
before that the platform had been 
locked for two days on end and word 
was passed around to secure loose 
property. But that was all.” 

“Okay,” I said, “you tell me 
something. At the time the city was 
moving — were you aware of it?” 

“No — or I think not. I didn’t 
realize until afterward that it had 
moved. Thinking back, I don’t 
recall anything unusual about the 
day it must have happened — but 
I’ve never left the city, so I suppose 
all the time I was growing up I must 



134 



GALAXY 




have got used to whatever goes on. 
Does the city travel along a road?” 
“A system of tracks.” 

“But why?” 

“I shouldn’t tell you.” 

“You promised you would. Any- 
way, I don’t see what harm it would 
do to tell me how it moves — it’s 
pretty clear it does.” 

The old dilemma again, but what 
she said made sense even though it 
was in conflict with the oath. Grad- 
ually I was coming to wonder more 
and more about the continued 
validity of the oath, even as 1 felt it 
eroding about me. 

I said, “The city is moving toward 
something known as the optimum, 
which lies due north of the city. At 
the moment the city is about three 
and a half miles south of optimum.” 
“So it will stop soon?” 

“No — and that’s what isn’t clear 
to me. Apparently, even if the city 
ever did reach optimum it couldn’t 
stop as the optimum itself is always 
moving.” 

“Then what’s the point of trying 
to reach it?” 

I had no answer to that. I didn’t 
know. 

V ’’ ICTORIA continued to ask ques- 
tions and in the end 1 told her 
about the work on the tracks. 1 tried 
to keep my descriptions to the mini- 
mum, but it was difficult to know 
how far I was breaching the 
oath — in spirit if not in practice. I 
found that everything I said to her I 
qualified immediately afterward 



with a reference to the oath. 

Finally she said, “Look, don’t say 
any more about this. You obviously 
don’t want to.” 

“I’m just confused,” I said. “I’m 
forbidden to talk, but you’ve made 
me see that I don’t have any right to 
withhold from you what I know.” 

Victoria was silent for a minute or 
two. 

“I don’t know about you,” she 
said eventually, “but in the last few 
days I’ve begun to develop a rather 
strong dislike for the guild system.” 

“You’re not alone. I haven’t 
heard many advocate it.” 

“Do you think it could be that 
those in charge of the guilds keep it 
in operation after it has outlived its 
original purpose? It seems to me 
that the system works by suppres- 
sion of knowledge. I don’t see what 
that achieves. It has made me very 
discontented and I’m sure I’m not 
alone.” 

“Perhaps I’ll be like all the others 
when I become a full guildsman.” 

“I hope not,” she said and 
laughed. 

“There is one thing,” I said. 
“Whenever I’ve asked Malchus- 
kin — he’s the man I’m working 
with — the sort of questions you’ve 
asked me, he says that I’ll find out in 
due course. It’s as if there were a 
good reason for the guilds and it re- 
lates in some way to the reason the 
city has to move. So far, all I’ve 
learned is the city does have to 
move — but that’s all. When I’m out 
there it’s all work and there’s no 



INVERTED WORLD 



135 




time to ask questions. But what is 
clear is that moving the city is the 
first priority.” 

“If you ever find out, will you tell 
me?” 

I thought for a moment. “1 don’t 
see how I can promise that.” 
Victoria stood up abruptly and 
walked to the far side of the plat- 
form. She stood at the rail, looking 
out across the roof of the city build- 
ing below at the countryside. I made 
no move to join her. It was an 
impossible situation. Already I had 
said too much — and in her demands 
that I say more Victoria was placing 
too great a burden on me. And yet I 
couldn’t deny her. 

After a few minutes she returned 
to the seat and sat down beside me. 

“I’ve found out how we get 
married,” she said. 

“Another ceremony?” 

“No, it’s much simpler. We just 
have to sign a form and give a copy 
to each of our chiefs. I’ve got the 
forms downstairs — they’re really 
very straightforward.” 

“So we, could sign them right 
away.” 

“Yes.” She looked at me seri- 
ously. “Do you want to?” 

“Of course. Do you?” 

“Yes.” 

“In spite of everything?” 

“What do you mean?” she asked. 
“In spite of the fact that you and I 
can’t seem to talk without coming 
across something I either can’t or 
shouldn’t tell you — and the fact that 
you seem to blame me for it.” 



“Does it worry you?” 

“A lot, yes.” 

“We could postpone getting 
married if you prefer.” 

“Would that solve anything?” 

I was uncertain of what it would 
mean if Victoria and I broke off our 
engagement. Because the guilds 
had been instrumental in for- 
mally introducing us, what new 
breach of the system would it imply 
to say now that we did not intend to 
marry? On the other hand, with the 
formal introduction out of the way, 
no pressure had been put on us to 
marry immediately. As far as she 
and I were concerned the vexations 
of the limitations placed by the oath 
were the only differences between 
us. Without those, we seemed to 
be perfectly suited to each other. 

“Let’s leave it for a while,” said 
Victoria. 

Later in the day we returned to 
her room and the mood lightened 
considerably. We talked a lot, 
carefully skirting those topics of 
conversation we both knew caused 
problems — and by the time we went 
to bed our attitudes had changed. 
When we awoke in the morning we 
signed the forms and took them 
along to the guild leaders. Future 
Glausewitz was not in the city but I 
found another Future guildsman, 
and he accepted the form on Clause- 
witz’s behalf. Everyone seemed to be 
pleased and later that day Victoria’s 
mother spent a lot of time with us, 
telling us of what new freedoms and 
advantages we would enjoy.

GALAXY 




Before I left the city to rejoin 
Malchuskin on the tracks I cleared 
what remained of my possessions 
from the creche and moved in 
officially with Victoria. 

I was a married man and I was six 
hundred and fifty- two miles old. 

X 

F or the next few miles my life 
settled into a routine that was for 
the most part agreeable. During my 
visits to the city my life with Vic- 
toria was comfortable, happy and 
loving. She would tell me of her 
work and through her I came to 
learn how the day-to-day life of the 
city was administered. Sometimes 
she would ask me about my labors 
outside, but her early curiosity had 
either faded or she now thought 
better of asking me, for the resent- 
ments never again became as 
obvious as at first. 

Outside, my apprenticeship pro- 
gressed. The more work outside the 
city I participated in, the more I rea- 
lized how much of a mutual effort 
the city’s moving was. 

At the end of my last mile with 
Malchuskin I was transferred on 
order of Clausewitz to the militia. 
This came as an unpleasant sur- 
prise as I had assumed that on com- 
pletion of my training on the tracks I 
would start work with my own guild 
of Futures. However, I discovered 
that I was to be transferred to 
another first-order guild every three 
miles. 



I was sorry to leave Malchuskin, 
for his simple application to the 
strenuous work on the tracks had an 
undeniable appeal. After we were 
past the ridge the terrain had been 
easier for track-laving, and as the 
new group of hired men continued 
to labor without untoward com- 
plaint his discontents had seemed to 
fade. 

Before reporting to the militia I 
sought out Clausewitz. 1 did not 
wish to make too much of an issue, 
but I asked him for the reason 
behind the decision. 

“It’s standard practice, Mann,” 
he said. 

“But, sir, I thought by now I 
should be ready to enter my own 
guild.” 

He sat in a relaxed manner 
behind his desk, not in the least 
disturbed by my mild protest. I 
guessed tht such a query was not 
unusual. 

“We have to maintain a full 
militia. Sometimes it becpmes 
necessary to draft other guildsmen 
to defend the city. If so, we do not 
have the time then to train them. 
Every first-order guildsman has 
served time in the militia — and so 
must you.” 

There was no arguing with that 
and so I became Crossbowman 
Secpnd Class Mann for the next 
three miles. 

I detested this period, fuming at 
the waste of time and the apparent 
insensitivity of the men I was forced 
to work with. I knew that I was only

making life difficult for myself, and 
so it was, for within a few hours I 
was probably the most unpopular 
recruit in the entire militia. My only 
relief was the presence of two other 
apprentices — one with the Barter 
guild and another with the Track 
guild — who seemed to share my 
outlook. They, however, had the 
fortunate ability to adapt to the new 
company and suffered less than I. 

The quarters for the militia were 
in the area nrat to the stables at the 
very base of the city. These consisted 
of two large dormitories, and we 
were obliged to live, eat and sleep in 
conditions of intolerable over- 
crowding and filth. During the days 
we went through apparently endless 
periods of training. We made long 
marches across the countryside and 
were taught to fight unarmed, 
taught to swim rivers, taught to 
climb trees, taught to eat grass — 
any number of other futile activities. 
At the end of the three miles I had 
learned to shoot with a crossbow 
and how to defend myself when un- 
armed. I had made myself some 
bitter personal enemies and knew I 
should have to keep out of their way 
for some considerable time to come. 
I wrote it off to experience. 

After this I was transferred to the 
Traction guild and at once I was 
much happier. Indeed, from this 
point to the end of my apprentice- 
ship my life was pleasant and 
fruitful. 

The men responsible for the trac- 
tion of the city were quiet, hard- 



working and intelligent. They 
moved without haste, but they saw 
that the work for which they were re- 
sponsible was done — and done well. 

My one previous experience of 
their work — when watching the city 
being winched — had not revealed to 
me the extent of their operations. 
Traction was not simply a question 
of moving the city but also involved 
its internal affairs. 

I N THE center of the city, on the 
lowest level, I discovered, a large 
nuclear reactor was situated. It was 
from this that the city derived all its 
power, and the men who operated 
it were also responsible for the 
city’s communication and sanitary 
systems. Many of the Traction 
guildsmen were water engineers 
and I learned that throughout the 
city there was a complicated system 
of pumping which ensured that 
almost every last drop of water was 
continually recycled. The food-syn- 
thesizer, I discovered to my horror, 
was based on a sewage-filtration de- 
vice, and although it was operated 
and programed by administrators 
inside the city, it was in the Traction 
pumping room that the quantity 
(and in some respects the quality) 
of synthesized fo^ was ultimately 
determined. 

It was almost in the role of a sec- 
ondary function that the reactor was 
used to power the winches. 

There were six of these and they 
were built in a massive steel housing 
running east-west across the city’s 



138 



GALAXY 




base. Of the six, only five were used 
at any one time, the other being 
overhauled in rotation. The pri- 
mary cause for concern with the 
winches was the bearings which, 
after many thousands of miles’ use, 
were very worn. During the time I 
was with the Traction men there was 
a certain amount of debate on the 
subject of whether the winching 
should be carried out on four 
winches — thus allowing more time 
for servicing bearings — or should 
utilize all six winches, thus reducing 
wear. The consensus seemed to 
favor continuing with the present 
system, for no major decisions were 
taken. 

One of the jobs I worked on with 
the Traction men was checking the 
cables. This, too, was a recurring 
task, for the cables were as old as the 
winches and breakages happened 
more frequently than was ideal, 
which was never. Each of the six 
cables used by the city had been 
repaired several times and parts of 
each cable were beginning to fray. 
Before each winching, therefore, 
every one of the five cables to be 
used had to be checked over foot by 
foot, cleaned and greased and 
bound where frays occurred. 

Always — in the reactor room or 
during work outside on the cables — 
the talk was of catching up on the 
lost ground toward the optimum. 
How the winches might be improv- 
ed, how new cables might be ob- 
tained. The entire guild seemed to 
be alive with ideas, but these were 



not men fond of theories. Much of 
their work was concerned with 
mundane matters — for instance, 
while I was with the guild a new pro- 
ject was begun to construct an addi- 
tional water reservoir in the city. 

One pleasurable benefit of this 
aspect of my apprenticeship was 
that I was able to spend the nights 
with Victoria. Although I came 
back to the room at night hot and 
dirty from my work, I was for this 
short period enjoying the comforts 
of a domestic existence and the 
satisfactions of a worthwhile job. 

One day, while working outside 
the city as one of the cables was be- 
ing hauled mechanically out toward 
the distant stay emplacement, I 
asked the guildsman I was with 
about Gelman Jase. 

“An old friend of mine, appren- 
ticed to your guild. Do you know 
him?” 

“About your age is he?” 

“A bit older.” 

“We had a couple of apprentices 
a few miles back. Can’t remember 
their names. I can check, if you 
like.” 

I was curious to see Jase. It had 
been a long time since I’d seen him 
and I wanted to compare notes with 
someone who was going through the 
same process as myself. 

Later that day I was told that Jase 
had been one of the two apprentices 
the man had mentioned. I asked 
how I could contact him. 

“He won’t be around for a while.” 

“Where is he?” I said. 



INVERTED WORLD 



139 




“He’s left the city. Down past.” 

T oo soon my timewiththeTrac- 
tion guild ended and I was 
transferred to Barter for the next 
three miles. I greeted this news with 
mixed feelings, having witnessed 
one of their operations at first hand . 
To my surprise I learned I was to 
work with Barter Codings — and to 
my further surprise I discovered it 
was he who had requested I work 
with him. 

“I heard you were joining the 
guild for three miles,” he said. 
“Thought I’d show you our work 
isn’t all dealing with rioting tooks.” 
Like the other guildsmen, Col- 
lings had a room in one of the for- 
ward towers of the city and here he 
showed me a long roll of paper with 
a detailed plan drawn on it. 

“You needn’t take too much 
notice of most of this. It’s a map of 
the terrain ahead of us and it's com- 
piled by the Futures.” He showed 
me the symbols for mountains, 
rivers, valleys, steep gradients — all 
vital information for those who 
planned the route the city would 
take on its long slow journey toward 
optimum. “These black squares 
represent settlements. They’re what 
we’re concerned with. How many 
languages do you speak?” 

I told him that I had never found 
languages easy when in the creche, 
only spoke French — and that halt- 
ingly. 

“As well you’re not planning to 
join our guild permanently,” he 



said. “Ability with languages is our 
stock in trade.” 

He told me that the local 
inhabitants spoke Spanish and that 
he and the other Barter guildsmen 
had had to learn the language from 
one of the books in the library as 
there were no people of Spanish 
descent in the city. They got by, but 
there were recurring difficulties 
with dialects. 

Collings told me that of all the 
first-order guilds only the Track 
guild used hired labor regularly. 
Sometimes the Bridge-builders had 
to hire men for short periods, but by 
and large the major part of the 
Barters’ work consisted of hiring 
manual laborers for the track 
work — and what Collings referred 
to as “transference.” 

“What is that?” I asked im- 
mediately. 

Collings said, “It’s what makes us 
so unpopular. The city looks for 
settlements where food is short, 
where poverty is widespread. Fortu- 
nately for the city this is a poor 
region, so we have a strong bargain- 
ing position. We can offer the locals 
food, technology to help their farm- 
ing, medicines, electrical power — in 
return the men labor for us and we 
borrow their young women. They 
come to the city for a short while and 
perhaps they will give birth to new 
citizens.” 

“I’ve heard of this,” I said, “I 
can’t believe it happens.” 

“Why not?” 

“Isn’t it — immoral?” 



140 



GALAXY 




“Is it immoral to want to keep the 
city peopled? Without fresh blood 
we would die out within a couple of 
generations. Most children bom to 
people in the city are male.” 

I remembered the light that had 
started. “But the women who trans- 
fer to the city are sometimes 
married, aren’t they?” 

“Yes. But they stay only to give 
birth to one child. After that they 
are free to leave.” 

“What happens to the child?” 
“If it is a girl she stays in the city 
and is brought up in the creche. If it 
is a boy the mother may take it with 
her or may leave it in the city.” 
And then 1 understood the 
diffidence with which Victoria had 
spoken on this subject. My mother 
had come to the city from out- 
side, and afterward had left. She 
had not taken me with her. I had 
been rejected. But there was no pain 
for me in this realization. 

B ack outside the city, I saw that 
the usual work on tracks and 
cables continued — if with a general 
shortage of labor — and that we were 
now only two miles from the site of 
the bridge. Speaking to one of the 
Traction guildsmen as I passed I 
learned that the city was only one 
and a half miles from optimum. 

This information did not register 
until later, when I realized that the 
bridge itself must actually be to the 
north of optimum by about a 
half-mile. 

There followed a long period of 



delay. The bridge-building pro- 
ceeded slowly. After the accident 
more stringent safety precautions 
were introduced and there were re- 
curring checks by Lerouex’s men on 
the strength of the structure. As we 
worked, we learned that the track- 
laying operations at the city were 
going slowly — in one sen^e this suit- 
ed us, as the bridge was a long way 
from being ready, but in another it 
was a cause for anxiety. Any time 
lost in the endless pursuit of the op- 
timum was not good. 

One day word passed around the 
site that the bridge itself was at the 
point of optimum. This news caused 
me to look anew at our surround- 
ings, but there seemed to be nothing 
unusual about optimum. Once 
again, I wondered what its special 
significance was, but as the days 
passed and the optimum moved on 
in its arcane way northward it 
moved also from my thoughts. 

With the resources of the city now 
being concentrated on the bridge, 
there was no chance of furthering 
my apprenticeship. Every ten days I 
was allowed my leave — as were all 
guildsmen on the site — but there 
was no thought now of my acquir- 
ing a general knowledge of the 
function of the various guilds. The 
bridge was the priority. 

Other work continued, though. 
A few yards to the south of the 
bridge a cable-stay emplacement 
was built and the tracks were run 
up to it. In due course the city was 
winched along the tracks, and it 



INVERTED WORLD 



141 




stood silently near the chasm 
waiting for the completion of the 
bridge. 

The most difficult and demand- 
ing aspect of the bridge-building 
came with running the chains across 
the chasm from the south towers to 
the north, then suspending the rails 
from them. Time was passing and 
Lerouex and the other guildsmen 
grew worried. I understood this was 
because, as the optimum moved 
slowly northward away from the 
bridge, the construction of the 
bridge itself would soon be laying 
itself open to the same problem that 
Malchuskin had shown me with the 
tracks to the south of the city — it 
was likely to buckle. Although the 
design of the bridge was intended 
to compensate for this to a certain 
extent, there was a definite limit to 
how long we could delay the cross- 
ing. Now work continued through 
the nights, lit by brilliant arc- lamps 
powered from within the city. Leave 
was suspended and a system of 
shifts devised. 

As the slabs of the railway were 
laid, Malchuskin and the others put 
down tracks. Meanwhile, cable 
stays • were being erected on the 
northern side, just beyond the 
elaborate ramps. 

The city was so close by that we 
were able to sleep in our quarters in- 
side it and I found a confusing 
difference between the extreme 
activity of the bridge site and the 
comparatively calm and normal 
atmosphere of everyday work inside 



the city. My behavior evidently re- 
flected this confusion, because for a 
while Victoria’s questions about the 
work outside were renewed. 

Soon, though, the bridge was 
ready. There was a further delay of a 
day while Lerouex and the other 
Bridges guildsmen carried out a 
series of elaborate tests. Their 
expressions stayed concerned, even 
as they pronounced the bridge safe. 
During the hours of the night the 
city prepared for the winching. 

As dawn was breaking, the 
Traction men signaled the clear — 
and with infinite stealth the city 
inched forward. I had taken a 
vantage point on one of the two sus- 
pension towers on the south side of 
the chasm and as the city’s forward 
wheels moved slowly onto the tracks 
on the railway itself I felt a tremble 
of vibration through the tower as the 
chains took the strain. In the weak 
light of the rising sun I saw the sus- 
pension chains being tugged into a 
deeper curve by the weight, the rails 
clearly sagging under their immense 
burden. I looked at the Bridges 
guildsman nearest me, who was 
squatting on the tower a few yards 
away from me. His whole attention 
was on a loadmeter, which was con- 
nected to the overhead chains. No 
one watching the delicate operation 
moved or spoke, as if the slightest 
interruption could disturb the 
balance. The city moved on and 
soon the entire length of the bridge 
was bearing the weight of the city. 

The silence was broken abruptly. 



142 



GALAXY 




With a loud cracking noise that 
echoed around the rocky walls of the 
chasm one of the winch cables 
snapped and whiplashed back, 
slicing through a line of militiamen. 
A physical tremor ran through the 
structure of the bridge and from 
deep inside the city I heard the 
rising whine of the suddenly free 
winch, sharply cut off as the 
Traction man controlling the differ- 
ential drive phased it out. Now on 
only four cables and moving visibly 
slower, the city continued on its 
way. On the northern side of the 
chasm, the broken cable lay snaked 
across the ground, curling over the 
bodies of five of the militiamen. 

The most critical part of the 
crossing was done — the city moved 
between the two northern towers 
and began to slide slowly down the 
ramps toward the cable stays. Soon 
it stopped, but no one spoke. There 
was no sense of relief, no cry of 
celebration. On the far side of the 
chasm the bodies of the militiamen 
were being placed onto stretchers, 
ready to be taken into the city. The 
city itself was made safe for the mo- 
ment, but there was much to be 
done. The bridge had caused an 
unavoidable delay and now the city 
was four and a half miles behind op- 
timum. The tracks had to be taken 
up, the broken cable repaired. The 
suspension towers and chains had to 
be dismantled and saved for 
possible future use. 

Soon the city would be winching 
again — ever onward, ever north- 



ward, heading for the optimum that 
managed somehow to be always a 
few miles ahead. 

T he barter guildsmen, like 
those of the Future, rode out 
across the countryside on horses. I 
had never learned to ride and so, 
when we left the city and headed 
north, I walked beside Collings. 
Later he showed me how to ride a 
horse, telling me that I would need 
to ride when I joined my father’s 
guild. The technique came slowly. 
At first I was frightened of the 
animal and found it difficult to con- 
trol. Gradually, as I realized the 
beast was docile and good-natured, 
my confidence grew and the 
horse — as if understanding this — 
responded better. 

We did not travel far from the 
city. There were two settlements to 
the northeast and we visited both. 
We were greeted with some curi- 
osity, but Collings’s assessment was 
that neither settlement displayed 
any great need for the commodities 
the city could offer and he made no 
attempts to negotiate. He told me 
that the city’s needs for labor were 
met for the moment and that there 
were enough transferred women to 
be going on with. 

After the first journey away from 
the city — which took nine days and 
during which we lived and slept in 
the rough — I returned to the city 
with Collings, to hear the news that 
th^Council of Navigators had given 
the go-ahead for a bridge to be built. 



INVERTED WORLD 



143 




According to the interpretation 
Codings gave me two possible routes 
lay ahead for the city. One angled 
toward the northwest and, although 
avoiding a narrow chasm, led 
through hilly country with much 
broken rock. The other led across 
more level cpuntry but required a 
bridge to be built across the chasm. 
This latter course had been selected 
and all available labor was to be di- 
verted temporarily to the Bridge- 
builders guild. 

As the bridge was now the major 
priority, Malchuskin and another 
Track guildsman and their gangs 
were drafted. About half of the 
entire militia force was relieved of 
other duties to assist and several 
men from the Traction guild were to 
supervise the laying of the rail over 
the bridge. Ultimate responsibility 
for the design and structure of the 
bridge lay with the Bridge-builders 
guild and it requested fifty addi- 
tional hired laborers from the 
Barter guild. 

Collings and another Barter 
guildsman left the city at once and 
headed for the local settlements. 
Meanwhile I was taken north to the 
site of the bridge and was placed in 
the charge of the supervising guilds- 
man, Bridges Lerouex — Victoria’s 
father. 

When I saw the chasm I realized 
that it presented a major engineer- 
ing problem. It was wide — about 
sixty yards across at the point 
selected for the bridge — and the 
chasm walls were crumbly and 



broken. A fast-running stream lay 
at the bottom. In addition, the 
northern side of the chasm was some 
ten feet lower than the southern 
side, which meant that the track 
would have to be laid on a ramp for 
some distance after the chasm. 

The Bridge-builders guild had 
decided that the bridge must be sus- 
pended. There was insufficient time 
to build an arch or cantilever struc- 
ture and the other favored meth- 
od — that of a timber scaffolding 
support in the chasm itself — was 
impracticable owing to the nature 
of the chasm. 

Work started immediately on the 
building of four towers: two each to 
north and south of the chasm. These 
were apparently insubstantial af- 
fairs, built of tubular steeL During 
the construction one man fell from a 
tower and was killed. The work con- 
tinued without delay. Shortly after 
this I was allowed to return to the 
city for one of my periods of leave 
and while I was there the city was 
winched forward. It was the first 
time I had been inside the city and 
aware that a winching operation was 
taking place. I was interested to 
note that there was no discernible 
sensation of movement, although 
there was a slight increase in back- 
ground noise, presumably from the 
winch motors. 

It was during this leave, too, that 
Victoria told me she was pregnant — 
an announcement that caused her 
mother much joy. I was delighted 
and for one of the few times in my 



144 



GALAXY 




life I drank too much wine and 
made a fool of myself. No one 
seemed to mind. 

BOOK TWO 

XI 

H elward MANN was riding. 

Standing in the stirrups, his 
head down against the side of the 
neck of the large tan mare, he re- 
joiced in the sensations of speed: the 
wind blowing back his hair, the 
crunch of hooves against the pebbly 
soil, the rippling of the beast’s mus- 
cular loins, the ever-present antici- 
pation of a stumble, a throw. He was 
riding south, away from the primi- 
tive settlement he had just left, 
down through the foothills and 
across the plain toward the city. As 
the city of Earth came into view be- 
hind a low rise of ground Helward 
slowed the horse to a canter and 
guided her in a broad turn, so that 
they headed back north. Soon the 
horse was walking and, as the day 
grew hotter, Helward dismounted 
and walked by her side. 

He was thinking of Victoria, now 
many miles pregnant. She was 
looking healthy and beautiful and 
the Medical administrator had said 
the pregnancy was going well. 
Helward was allowed more time in 
the city now and he and Victoria 
spent many days together. It was 
fortunate that the city was once 
again moving across unbroken 
ground, because he knew that if an- 



other bridge became necessary — or 
an emergency of any sort arose — his 
time with her would be curtailed 
drastically. 

He was waiting now for his 
apprenticeship to end. He had 
worked hard and long with all the 
guilds save one — his own, the 
Futures guild. Barter Collins had 
told him the end of the appren- 
ticeship was approaching and later 
the same day he was to see Future 
Clausewitz and formally discuss his 
progress thus far. The apprentice- 
ship couldn’t end soon enough for 
Helward. Though still an adolescent 
in his emotional outlook, by the 
ways of the city he was deemed an 
adult; he had indeed worked and 
learned for that status. Fully aware 
of the city’s external priorities, if 
still not sure of their rationale, he 
was ready to be accorded his title of 
full guildsman. In the last few miles 
his body had grown muscular and 
lean and his skin had tanned to a 
deep healthy golden. He was no 
longer stiff after a day of labor and 
he welcomed the sensation of 
well-being that followed a difficult 
task well done. With most of the 
guildsmen he had worked under he 
had become respected and liked for 
his willingness to work hard and 
without question. And as his 
domestic life in the city settled down 
to a steady and loving relationship 
with Victoria he became known and 
accepted as a man with whom the 
city’s security could be entrusted. 

With Barter Collings in particu- 



INVERTED WORLD 



145 




lar, Helward had established a good 
and amicable working partnership. 
When he had served his obligatory 
three-mile periods with each of the 
other guilds he had been allowed to 
choose a further period of five miles 
with any one of the guilds but his 
own and l\e had immediately asked 
to work with Collings. The barter 
work attracted him, for it enabled 
him to see something of the way of 
life of the local people. 

The area through which the city 
was currently passing was high and 
barren and the soil was poor. Settle- 
ments were few and those that the 
guild approached were almost in- 
variably clustered around one or an- 
other collection of ramshackle 
buildings. The squalor was terrible 
and disease was widespread. There 
appeared to be no kind of central 
administration, for each of the 
settlements had its own rituals of 
organization. Sometimes Collings’s 
men were greeted with hostility and 
at other times the people hardly 
seemed to care. 

The barter work was one largely 
of judgment, of assessing the 
particular outlook and needs of a 
chosen community and negotiating 
along those lines. Negotiations were 
fruitless in most cases — the one 
thing all settlements seemed to 
share was an abiding lethargy. 
When Collings could initiate any 
kind of interest, the needs became 
immediately apparent. By and 
large, the city could fulfill them. 
With its high degree of organization 



and the technology available to it 
the city had, over the miles, accum- 
ulated a large stockpile of food- 
stuffs, medicines, chemicals and it 
had also learned by experience 
which of these were most required. 
So with offers of antibiotics, seeds, 
fertilizers, water-purifiers — even, 

in some cases, offers of assistance 
in repairing existing local imple- 
ments — the Barter guildsmen could 
lay the groundwork for their own 
demands. 

Collings had tried to teach Hel- 
ward to speak Spanish, but he had 
little ability with languages. He 
picked up a handful of phrases, but 
contributed very little to the often 
lengthy periods of negotiation. 

T erms had been agreed upon 
with the settlement they had 
just left. Twenty men could be 
raised to work on the city tracks and 
another ten were promised from a 
smaller settlement some distance 
aw£(y. In addition, five women had 
either volunteered or been co- 
erced — Helward was uncertain 
which and he did not question Col- 
lings — to move into the city. He and 
Collings were now returning to the 
city to obtain the promised supplies 
and prepare the various guilds for 
the new influx of temporary popula- 
tion. Collings had decided that all of 
the people should be medically 
examined, and this would place an 
additional burden on the Medical 
administrators. 

Helward liked working to the 



146 



GALAXY 




north of the city. This would soon be 
his territory for it was up here, be- 
yond the optimum, that the Future 
guild did its work. He often saw 
Future guildsmen riding north, 
away into the distant territory where 
one day the city would have to 
travel. Once or twice he had seen his 
father and they had spoken briefly. 
Helward had hoped that with his 
experience as an apprentice the un- 
ease that dogged their relationship 
would vanish, but his father was 
apparently as uncomfortable as ever 
in his company. Helward suspected 
that there was no deep and subtle 
reason for this, because Collings 
had once been talking about the 
Future guild, and had mentioned 
Future Mann. “A difficult man to 
talk to,” Collings had said. “Plea- 
sant when you get to know him, but 
he keeps to himself.” 

After half an hour Helward 
remounted the horse and walked 
her back, retracing his last course. 
Some time later he came across 
Collings, who was resting in the 
shade of a large boulder. Helward 
joined him and they shared some of 
the food. As a gesture of goodwill, 
the leader of the settlement had 
given them a large slab of fresh 
cheese and they ate some of it, rel- 
ishing the break from their more 
normal diet of processed, synthe- 
sized food. 

“If they eat this," Helward said, 
“1 can’t see that they would have 
much use for our slop.” 

“Don’t think they eat this all the 



time. This was the only one they 
had. It was probably stolen from 
somewhere else. I saw no cattle.” 
“So why did they give it to us?” 
“They need us.” 

S OME TIME later Helward and 
Collings continued on their way 
toward the city. Both men walked, 
leading the horses. Helward was at 
once looking forward to returning to 
the city and regretting that this 
period of his apprenticeship had 
ended. Realizing that this was prob- 
ably the last time he would have with 
Collings, he felt the stirrings of an 
old and long-buried intention to 
talk about something that still 
caused him to fret from time to 
time — of all the men he had met 
outside the city Collings was the only 
one with whom he could discuss it. 
Even so, he turned over the problem 
in his mind for some time before 
finally deciding to raise it. 

“You’re unnaturally quiet,” said 
Collings suddenly. 

“I know — sorry. I’m thinking 
about becoming a guildsman. I’m 
not sure I’m ready.” 

“Why?” 

“It’s not easy to say. It’s a vague 
doubt.” 

“Do you want to talk about it?” 
“Yes. That is — can I?” 

“I don’t see why not.” 

“Well — some of the guildsmen 
won’t agree,” said Helward. “I was 
very confused when I first came out- 
side the city and I learned then not 
to ask too many questions.” 



INVERTED WORLD 



147 




“What were the questions?” 
Helward decided to abandon try- 
ing to justify himself. 

“They dealt with two things — the 
optimum and the oath. I’m not sure 
about either of them.” 

‘‘That’s not surprising. I’ve 
worked with dozens of apprentices 
over the miles and they all worry 
about these.” 

“Can you tell me what I want to 
know?” 

Collings shook his head. “Not 
about the optimum. That’s for you 
to discover for yourself.” 

“But all I know about it is that it 
moves northward. Is it an arbitrary 
thing?” 

“It’s not arbitrary — but I can’t 
talk about it. 1 promise you that 
you’ll find out what you want to 
know very soon. But what’s the 
problem with the oath?” 

Helward was silent for a moment. 
Then he said. “If you knew I’d 
broken it — if y«u knew at this mo- 
ment — you’d kill me. Is that right?” 
“In theory, yes.” 

“And in practice?” 

“I’d worry about it for days, then 
probably talk to one of the other 
guildsmen and see what he advised. 
But you haven’t broken it, have 
you?” 

“I’m not sure.” 

“You’d better tell me about it.” 
“All right.” 

Helward started to talk about the 
questions Victoria had asked. He 
tried to confine his account to vague 
generalities. But as Collings stayed 



silent, Helward found himself going 
into more and more detail. Soon he 
was recounting, almost word for 
word, everything he had told her. 

When he had finished Collings 
said, “I don’t think you’ve anything 
to worry about.” 

“Why not?” 

“No harm has come of your 
saying anything to your wife.” 

T he city had come into view as 
they walked and they could see 
the customary signs of activity 
around the tracks. 

“But it can’t be as simple as 
that,” said Helward. “The oath is 
very firm in the way it is worded and 
the penalty is hardly a light one.” 
“True — but the guildsmen who 
are alive today inherited it. The oath 
was passed to us and we pass it on. 
So will you in your turn. This isn’t to 
say the guilds agree with it, but no 
one has yet come up with an 
alternative.” 

“So the guilds would like to dis- 
pense with it if possible?” said 
Helward. 

Collings grinned at him. “That’s 
not what I said. The history of the 
city goes back a long way. The 
founder was a man named Francis 
Destain and it is generally believed 
that he introduced the oath. From 
what we can understand of the rec- 
ords of the time such a regimen of 
secrecy was probably desirable. But 
today — well, things are a little more 
lax.” 



148 



GALAXY 




“But the oath continues.” 

“Yes, and I think it still has a 
function. There are many people in 
the city who may never know what 
goes on out here — and will never 
need to know. These are the people 
who are mainly concerned with the 
running of the city’s services. They 
come into contact with the people 
from outside the city — the trans- 
ferred women, for example — and if 
they were to speak too freely, 
perhaps the true nature of the city 
would become common knowledge 
with the people outside. We already 
have trouble with the locals, the 
fooks as the militia calls them. You 
see, the city’s existence is a pre- 
carious one and has to be guarded at 
all costs.” 

“Are we in danger?” 

“Not at the moment. But if there 
were any sabotage the danger would 
be immediate and great. We’re 
unpopular as things stand. There’s 
no profit in allowing that unpopu- 
larity be compounded with a local 
awareness of our vulnerability.” 
“So I can be more open with 
Victoria?” 

“Use your judgment. She’s Le- 
rouex’s daughter, isn’t she? Sen- 
sible girl. As long as she keeps to 
herself whatever you tell her I can’t 
see any harm. But don’t go talking 
to too many people.” 

“I won’t,” said Helward. 

“And don’t go talking about the 
optimum’s moving. It doesn’t.” 
Helward looked at him in 
surprise. “I was told it moved.” 



“You were misinformed. The 
optimum is stationary.” 

“Then why does the city never 
reach it?” 

“It does, from time to time,” said 
Collings. “But it can never stay 
there for long. The ground moves 
away southward from it.” 

XII 

T he tracks extended about one 
mile to the north of the city. As 
Helward and Collings approached 
they saw one of the winch cables 
being hauled out toward the stay 
emplacements. Within a day or two 
the city would move forward again. 

They led the horses over the 
tracks and walked down toward the 
city. Here on the north side was the 
entrance to the dark tunnel that ran 
beneath the city and gave the only 
official access to the interior. 

Helward walked with Collings as 
far as the stables. 

“Goodbye, Helward.” 

Helward took the proffered hand, 
and they shook warmly. 

“You make that sound very 
final.” 

Collings shrugged in an off-hand 
way. “I shan’t be seeing you for 
some time. Good luck, son.” 
“Where are you going?” 

“I’m not going anywhere. But you 
are. Just take care — and make what 
you can of whatever happens.” 
Before Helward could reply the 
man had turned away and hurried 
into the stables. For a moment Hel- 



INVERTED WORLD 



149 




ward was tempted to go after him, 
but an instinct told him that to do so 
would serve no purpose. Perhaps 
Collings had already told him more 
than he should. 

With mixed feelings Helward 
continued down the tunnel to the 
elevator and waited for the car. 
When it arrived he went straight to 
the fourth level to look for Victoria. 
She was not in their room so he 
went down to the synthetics plant to 
find her. She was now more than 
eighteen miles pregnant, but was 
planning to continue working for as 
long as possible. 

When she saw him she left her 
bench and they returned to the room 
together. There were still two hours 
to spare before Helward was to see 
Future Clausewitz and they passed 
the time with inconsequential 
conversation. Later, when the door 
was unlocked, they spent a few 
minutes together on the outside 
platform. 

At the appointed time Helward 
went up to the seventh level and 
gained access to the guild block. He 
was now no stranger to this part of 
the city, but he visited it infre- 
quently enough to feel still slightly 
in awe of the senior guildsmen and 
Navigators. 

Clausewitz was waiting in the 
Future guild room and was alone. 
He greeted Helward cordially and 
offered him some wine. 

From the Futures’ room it was 
possible to see through a small win- 
dow to the north of the city. Ahead, 



Helward could see the rising ground 
he had been working in during the 
last few days. 

“You’ve settled in well. Appren- 
tice Mann.” 

“Thank you, sir.” 

“Do you feel ready to become a 
Future?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Good — from the guild’s point of 
view there’s po reason why you 
shouldn’t make it. You’ve earned 
yourself some good reports.” 
“Except for the militia. 

“You needn’t concern yourself 
witt« that. Militai7 life doesn’t suit 
everyone.” 

Helward felt a small relief. He 
had wondered if word of his bad 
showing in the militia had gotten 
back to his guild. 

“The purpose of this interview,” 
Clausewitz went on, “is to tell you 
what is to happen next. You still 
have a nominal three miles’ 
apprenticeship to serve with our 
guild, but as far as I am concerned 
that will be a mere technicality. Be- 
fore that, though, you are to leave 
the city. It’s a part of your training. 
You will probably be away for some 
time.” 

“May I inquire for how long?” 
said Helward. 

“It’s difficult to say. Several 
miles, certainly. It might be as 
short as ten or fifteen or it might be 
as lon^ as a hundred miles of time.” 
“But Victoria — ” 

“Yes, I understand she’s expect- 
ing a child. When is it due?” 



150 



GALAXY 




“In about nine miles,” said 
Helward. 

Clausewitz frowned. “I’m afraid 
you will have to be away at that time. 
There’s really no alternative.” 

“But couldn’t this trip be left 
until afterward?” 

“I’m sorry, no. There’s some- 
thing you have to do. You know by 
now that from time to time the city is 
obliged to barter for the use of 
women from the outside. We keep 
these women for as short a time as 
possible, but even so they are rarely 
here for less than thirty miles. It is 
part of the bargain we strike that 
they are given safe conduct back to 
their settlements — and there are 
now three women who wish to leave. 
It is the custom of the city to use the 
apprentices to conduct them back, 
particularly as we now see this as an 
important part of the training 
process.” 

H elward had been forced by 
the very nature of his work to 
become more sure of himself. “Sir, 
my wife is expecting her first baby. I 
must be with her.” 

“It’s out of the question.” 
“What if I refuse to go?” 

“You will be shown a copy of the 
oath you swore and you will accept 
the punishment it prescribes.” 
Helward opened his mouth to 
reply, but hesitated. This was 
evidently not the time to debate the 
validity of the oath. Future Clause- 
witz was clearly restraining himself. 
On Helward’s resistance to the in- 



struction the guildsman’s face had 
turned a deep pink and he had sat 
down, resting his hands palms down 
on the tabletop. 

Instead of saying what was on his 
mind, Helward asked: “Sir, can I 
appeal to your reason?” 

“You can appeal, but I cannot be 
reasonable. You swore in your oath 
to place the security of the city above 
all other matters. Your guild 
training is a matter of city 
security — and that’s the end of it.” 
“But surely it could be delayed? 
As soon as the child is born, I could 
leave.” 

“No.” Clausewitz turned and 
pulled forward a large sheet of 
paper, covered in part with a map 
and in part with several lists of 
figures. “These women must be 
returned to their settlements. In the 
nine miles or so of time it will take 
for your wife to deliver her baby, the 
settlements will be dangerously 
distant. They are already more than 
forty miles to the south of us. The 
plain fact is that you are the next ap- 
prentice on this schedule and it is 
you who must go.” 

“Is that your last word, sir?” 
“Yes.” 

Helward put down his untouched 
glass of wine and walked toward the 
door. 

“Helward, wait.” 

He paused at the door. “If I am to 
leave, I would like to see my wife.” 
“You have a few more days. You 
leave in half a mile’s time.” 

Five days. It was almost no time. 



INVERTED WORLD 



151 




“Well?” Helward no longer felt 
the need to display customary cour- 
tesies. 

“Sit down, please.” Reluctantly, 
Helward complied. “Don’t think 
I’m inhuman, but ironically this ex- 
pedition will reveal to you why some 
of the city’s customs might seem to 
be inhuman, ft is our way and it is 
forced on us. I understand your 
concern for Victoria, but you, must 
go down past. There is no better way 
for you to understand the situation 
of the city. What lies there to the 
south of us is the reason for the oath, 
for the apparent barbarisms of our 
ways. You are an educated man, 
Helward. Do you know of any civil- 
ized culture in history that has bar- 
tered for women for the simple, un- 
complicated reason of wanting one 
gestation from them? And then, 
when that gestation is completed, 
to return them?” 

“No, sir,” Helward paused. 
“Except—” 

“Except primitive tribes of sav- 
ages who raped and pillaged. Well, 
maybe we’re a little better than that, 
but the principle’s no less savage. 
Our barter is one-sided, for all that 
the contrary may seem to be. We 
propose the bargain, call our own 
terms, pay the price and move on 
our way. What I am telling you must 
be done. That you abandon your 
wife at a time when she needs you 
most is one small inhumanity that 
stems from a way of life that is itself 
inhuman.” 

Helward said, “Neither one 



excuses the other in my mind.” 
“No — I’ll grant you that. But you 
are bound by your oath. That oath 
stems from the causes of the major 
inhumanities and when you make 
your personal sacrifice you will 
understand better.” 

“Sir, the city should change its 
ways.” 

“But you will see that’s im- 
possible.” 

“By traveling down past?” 
“Much will become clear. Not 
all.” Clausewitz stood up. “Hel- 
ward, you’ve been a good apprentice 
so far. I can see that in the miles to 
come you will continue to work hard 
and well for the city. You have a 
good and beautiful wife, a lot to live 
for. You aren’t under threat of 
death, I promise you that. The 
penalty of the oath has never been 
invoked as far as I know, but I ask 
that this task that the city calls upon 
you to do be done — and done now. I 
have done it in my time — so has your 
father and so have all other guilds- 
men. Even now there are seven of 
your colleagues — all apprentices — 
down past. They have had to face 
similar personal hardships and not 
all have faced them willingly.” 
Helward stood, shook hands with 
Clausewitz and went in search of 
Victoria. 

XIII 

F ive days later Helward was 
ready to leave. That he would go 
had never been in serious doubt, but 



152 



GALAXY 




his enforced absence had not been 
easy to explain to Victoria. Al- 
though at first she had been 
horrified by the news, her attitude 
had changed abruptly. 

“You have to go, of course. Don’t 
use me as an excuse.” 

“But what about the child?” 

“I’ll be all right,” she said. 
“What could you do if you were 
here? Stand around and make 
everyone nervous? The doctors will 
look after me. This isn’t the first 
pregnancy they’ve had to deal 
with.” 

“But — don’t you want me to be 
there with you?” he said. 

She had reached out and taken 
his hand in hers. 

“Of course,” she said. “But 
remember what you said. The oath 
isn’t as rigid as you thought. I know 
you’re going — and when you get 
back there’ll be no mystery any 
more. And if what Barter Collings 
told you about the oath is true 
you’ll be able to talk to me about 
what you see.” 

Helward had not been sure of 
what she meant by this. For some 
time he had been in the habit of 
confiding in her much of what he 
saw and did outside the city and 
Victoria listened with great interest. 
He no longer saw the harm in 
talking to her, though it worried 
him that she should continue to be 
so interested, particularly when so 
much of what he said was confined 
to what he considered to be routine 
details. 



The result was that on his own 
personal score he no longer had a 
motive to try to avoid the journey 
down past, and indeed the idea 
excited him. He had heard so much 
of it, mostly by implication and half- 
reference, and now the time had 
come for him to venture that way 
himself. Jase was down past — per- 
haps they would meet. He wanted to 
see Jase again. So much had 
happened since they last saw each 
other. Would they even recognize 
each other? 

Victoria did not come to see him 
leave. She was in the room when he 
left her, still in bed. During the 
night they had made love tenderly 
and gently, making half-hearted 
jokes about making it “last.” She 
had clung to him when he kissed her 
goodbye and as he closed the door 
and went into the corridor he 
thought he heard her sobbing. He 
paused, debating whether to go 
back to her, but after a moment’s 
hesitation he continued on his way. 
He saw no benefit in prolonging the 
situation. 

Clausewitz was waiting for him in 
the Futures’ room. In one corner a 
modest pile of equipment had been 
laid and spread out on the table was 
a large plan. Clausewitz’s manner 
was different from that of the pre- 
vious interview. As soon as Helward 
let himself into the room Clausewitz 
led him to the desk and without pre- 
amble explained what he was to do. 

“This is a composite plan of the 
land to the south of the city. It’s 



INVERTED WORLD 



153 




based on a linear scale. You know 
what that means?” 

Helward nodded. 

“Good. One inch on this is rough- 
ly equivalent to one mile — but 
linearly. For reasons you’ll discover, 
that won’t help you later. Now, the 
city is here at fhe moment — and the 
settlement you have to find is here.” 
Clausewitz pointed to a cluster of 
black spots at the other end of the 
plan. “As of today that’s exactly 
forty-two miles from here. Once you 
leave the city you will find that dis- 
tances are confusing and so are 
directions. In which case the best 
advice I can give you, as we give all 
our apprentices, is to follow the 
tracks of the city. When you go 
south they are the only contact you 
will have with the city, and the only 
way you will find your way back. 
The pits dug for the sleepers and the 
foundations should still show. Have 
you got that?” 

“Yes sir.” 

“You are making this journey for 
one main reason. You must see that 
the women we entrust to you arrive 
safely at their village. When that has 
been done you return to the city 
without delay.” 

H elward was occupied with 
mental calculations. He knew 
how long it took him to walk a 
mile — ^just a few minutes. On a full 
day’s march in hot weather he could 
hope to cover at least twelve 
miles — with the women to slow him 
up, half that. Six miles a day, and 



that made seven days for the 
outward trip, three or four days for 
the return. At best, he could be back 
at the city within ten days — or one 
mile, as the city measured elapsed 
time. Suddenly he wondered why he 
had been told that he could not be 
back in time for the birth of his 
child. What had Clausewitz said the 
other day? That he would be gone 
ten or fifteen miles — perhaps even 
as long as a hundred! It didn’t 
make sense. 

“You’ll need some way of 
measuring distance, so that you’ll 
know when you’re in the region of 
the settlement. Between the city and 
the settlement there are thirty-four 
old sites of our stay emplacements. 
They’re marked on this plan as 
straight lines across the tracks. You 
shouldn’t have much difficulty in 
locating them: although the tracks 
are built over the sites after they’ve 
been used, they leave quite distinct 
marks in the ground. Keep to the 
left outer track. That is, as you walk 
southward, the one farthest to the 
right. It is on this side of the track 
that the settlement is situated.” 

“Surely the women will recognize 
the area where they used to live?” 
said Helward. 

“That’s correct. Now — the equip- 
ment you will need. It’s all here and 
I suggest you take it all. Don’t think 
you can dispense with any of it, 
because we know what we’re doing. 
Is that clear?” 

Once again Helward confirmed 
that he understood. With Clause- 



154 



GALAXY 




witz he went through the equip- 
ment. One pack contained nothing 
but dehydrated synthetic food and 
two large canteens of water. The 
other pack contained a tent and four 
sleeping bags. In addition, there 
was a length of stout rope, grappling 
irons, a pair of metal-studded 
boots — and a folded crossbow. 

“Are there any questions, Hel- 
ward?” 

“I don’t think so, sir.’’ 

“You’re quite sure?’’ 

Helward looked again at the pile 
of equipment. It was going to be a 
devil of a weight to carry unless he 
could share some of it with the 
women — and the sight of all that 
dried food had set his stomach 
lurching. 

“Could I not live off the land, 
sir?” he said. “I find the synthetic 
food rather tasteless.” 

“I would advise you to eat nothing 
that is not in these packs. You can 
supplement your water ration if you 
have to, but make sure the source is 
running water. If you eat anything 
that grows locally once you’re out of 
sight of the city, it will probably 
make you ill. If you don’t believe me 
you can try. I did, when I was down 
past, and I was sick for two days. 
This isn’t vague theory I’m giving 
you, it’s advice based on hard 
experience.” 

“But we eat local foods in the 
city.” 

“And the city is near optimum. 
You’re going a long way south of 
optimum.” 



“That changes the food, sir?” 
“Yes. Is there anything else?” 
“No sir.” 

“Good. Then there’s someone 
who would like to see you before you 

go” 

H e gestured toward an inner 
door and Helward walked to it. 
Beyond it was a smaller room and 
here his father was waiting for him. 

Helward’s first reaction was 
surprise, immediately followed by 
one of incredulity. He had seen his 
father last not more than ten days 
ago riding north — now, in that short 
period, it seemed to Helward that 
his father had aged suddenly and 
horribly. As he walked in his father 
stood up, balancing himself with an 
unsteady hand on the seat of his 
chair. He turned painfully to face 
Helward. His whole manner was 
marked with advanced age. He 
stood hunched — his clothes hung on 
him badly and the hand that came 
forward was trembling. 

“Helward. How are you son?” 
The manner had changed, too. 
There was no trace of the diffidence 
to which Helward had grown so 
accustomed. 

“Father — how are you?” 

“I’m fine, son. I’ve got to be 
taking it easy now, the doctor says. 
I’ve been north once too often.” He 
sat down again, and instinctively 
Helward stepped forward and 
helped him into his seat. “They tell 
me you’re going down past. Is that 
right?” 



INVERTED WORLD 



155 




“Yes, father.”, 

“You be careful, son. There’s a 
lot down there will give you thought. 
Not like up future — that’s my 
place.” 

Clausewitz had followed Helward 
and was now standing in the 
doorway. 

“Helward, you ought to know 
that your father has been given an 
injection.” 

Helward turned away from his 
father. 

“What do you mean?” 

“He came back to the city last 
night, complaining of chest pains. 
It’s been diagnosed as angina and 
he’s been given a painkiller. He 
ought to be in bed.” 

“All right, I shan’t be long.” 

Helward knelt on the floor beside 
the chair. 

“Do you feel all right now, 
father?” 

“I told you — I’m fine. Don’t 
worry about me. How’s Victoria?” 

“She’s getting on well.” 

“Good girl, Victoria.” 

“I’ll tell her to visit you,” said 
Helward. It was a terrible thing to 
see his father in this condition. They 
talked for a few more minutes, but 
soon the older man’s attention be- 
gan to wander. Eventually he closed 
his eyes and Helward stood up. 

“I’ll get one of the Medics,” said 
Clausewitz and hurried out of the 
room. When he returned a few 
minutes later there were two of the 
Medical administrators with him. 
Gently, they picked the old man up 



and carried him out to the corridor, 
where a wheeled trolley draped in 
white was waiting. 

“Will he be all right?” Helward 
asked. 

“He’s being looked after, that’s 
all I can say.” 

“He looks so old,” said Helward, 
unthinkingly. Clausewitz himself 
was in advanced years, though in 
demonstrably better health than his 
father. 

“An occupational hazard,” said 
Clausewitz. 

Helward glanced at him sharply, 
but found no further information 
forthcoming. Clausewitz picked up 
the metal-studded boots and push- 
ed them toward Helward. 

“Here — try these on,” he said. 

“My father — will you ask Vic- 
toria to visit him?” 

“Don’t worry about that. I’ll deal 
with it.” 

XIV 

H elward rode in the elevator to 
the second level, the packs and 
equipment loaded in beside him. 
When the car stopped he keyed the 
door-hold button and went along to 
the room to which Clausewitz had 
directed him. Four women and a 
man were waiting for him. As soon 
as he entered the room, Helward 
realized that only the man and one 
of the women were city adminis- 
trators. 

He was introduced to the other 
three, but they glanced at him 



156

briefly and looked away. Their ex- 
pressions revealed a suppressed 
hostility, deadened by an indiffer- 
ence that, until that moment, 
Helward himself had felt. Until 
entering the room he had given no 
thought as to who the women might 
be. He had not even speculated 
about their appearance. In fact, he 
recognized none of them, but 
hearing Clausewitz speak of them 
Helward had associated them in his 
mind with the women he had seen in 
the settlements while riding north 
with Barter Collings. Those women 
had been in general thin and pallid, 
their eyes sunk deep over prominent 
cheekbones, their arms scrawny and 
their chests flat. Dressed more often 
than not in ragged, filthy clothes, 
flies crawling over their faces, the 
women of the villages outside were 
pitiful wretches. 

These three had none of these 
characteristics. They wore neat city 
clothes; their hair was clean and 
well cut; their flesh was round and 
full and their eyes were clear. To his 
barely concealed surprise Helward 
saw that they were very young 
indeed: scarcely older than himself. 
The people of the city spoke of the 
women who were bartered from out- 
side as if they were mature — but 
these were nothing more than girls. 

He knew he was staring at them, 
but they paid him ho attention. 
What struck him hardest was the 
growing suspicion that these three 
had once been similar to the 
wretches he had seen in the villages 



and that by being brought to the city 
they had been restored temporarily 
to an approximation of the health 
and beauty that might have been 
theirs had they not been born into 
poverty. 

The woman administrator gave 
him a brief description of their 
background. Their names were 
Rosario, Caterina and Lucia. They 
spoke a little English. Each had 
been in the city for more than forty 
miles and each had given birth to a 
baby. There were two boys and a 
girl. Lucia — who had given birth to 
one of the boys — did not wish to 
keep the child and it was to stay in 
the city and be brought up in the 
creche. Rosario had chosen to keep 
her baby boy and it would be going 
with her back to the settlement. In 
Caterina’s case there had been no 
choice — but in any event she had ex- 
pressed indifference about losing 
her baby daughter. 

The administrator explained that 
Rosario was to be given as much of 
the powdered milk as she asked for, 
because she was still suckling the 
baby. The other two would have the 
same food as himself. 

Helward tried a friendly smile on 
the three girls, but they took no 
notice of him. When he tried to look 
at Rosario’s baby, she turned her 
back on him and clutched it to her 
possessively. 

There was nothing more to be 
told. They walked along the corri- 
dor toward the elevator, the three 
girls carrying their few belongings. 



INVERTED WORLD

They crowded into the car and Hel- 
ward keyed the button to take them 
to the lowest level. 

The girls continued to ignore him 
and spoke to each other in their own 
language. When, the car opened 
onto the dark passageway beneath 
the city, Helward struggled to re- 
move the equipment. None of the 
girls helped him, but watched with 
amused expressions. With difficulty 
Helward picked up the various 
packs and staggered toward the 
southern exit. 

The sun was dazzlingly bright. He 
put down the packs and glanced 
around. 

The city had been winched since 
he had last been outside and now 
track crews were taking up the rails. 
The girls shaded their eyes and 
looked about them. It was probably 
their first sight of the outside since 
coming to the city. 

The baby in Rosario’s arms began 
to cry. 

“Will you help me with this?” 
Helward asked, gesturing at the 
stack of food and equipment. The 
girls stared at him uncomprehend- 
ingly. “We ought to share the load.” 

They made no reply so he 
squatted down on the ground and 
opened the pack containing the 
food. He decided it would not be 
right to expect Rosario to carry any 
extra weight, so he divided the food 
into three packets, giving one to 
each to the other two and returning 
the rest to his pack. Lucia and 
Caterina reluctantly found room for 



the food-packets in their holdalls. 
The length of rope was the most un- 
wieldy part of the load and so 
Helward contrived to wind it into a 
tighter roll and stuff it into the pack. 
The grapple and pitons he managed 
to get into the pack containing the 
tent and the sleeping bags. Now his 
load was more manageable but not 
much lighter, and in spite of what 
Clausewitz had said Helward felt 
tempted to abandon most of it. 

The baby was still crying and 
Rosario appeared unconcerned. 

“Come on,” he said, feeling irri- 
tated. He set off, walking south, 
parallel to the tracks, and in a 
moment they followed him. They 
stayed together, keeping a distance 
of a few yards between themselves 
and him. 

H elward tried to set a good 
pace, but after an hour he rea- 
lized that his calculations about how 
long the expedition would take had 
been overly optimistic. The three 
girls moved slowly, complaining 
loudly about the heat and the sur- 
face of the ground. It was true that 
the shoes they had been given were 
unsuited for walking over this rough 
terrain, but he was afflicted no less 
by the heat. In fact, in his uniform 
and weighed down by the bulk of the 
equipment, he was most unplea- 
santly warm. 

They were still in sight of the city. 
The sun was only approaching its 
midday heat and the baby had not 
stopped crying. His sole relief so far 



158 



GALAXY 




had been a few moments of conver- 
sation with Malchuskin. The track- 
man had been delighted to see him 
and was still full of complaints 
about his hired laborers. He wished 
Helward well in his expedition. 

True to form, the girls had not 
waited for Helward and he had to 
cut short his visit with Malchuskin 
to hurry after them. 

Now he decided to call a rest. 

“Can’t you stop his crying?” he 
asked Rosario, pointing to the baby. 

The girl glared at him and sat 
down on the ground. 

“Okay,” she said. “I feed.” 

She stared at him defiantly and 
the other two girls waited at her 
side. Taking the point, Helward 
moved some distance away, keeping 
his back turned discreetly while she 
fed the baby. 

Later he opened one of the water 
canteens and passed it around. The 
day was impossibly hot and his 
temper was no better than that of 
the girls. He took off the jacket of 
his uniform and laid it over the top of 
one of the packs and although this 
meant he felt the bite of the straps 
more deeply he stayed a little cooler. 

He was impatient to move on. The 
baby had fallen asleep and two of 
the girls made a makeshift cot out of 
one of the sleeping bags, carrying it 
slung between them. Helward had 
to relieve them of their holdalls and 
although he was now overburdened 
with things to carry he gladly 
exchanged the extra discomfort for 
the welcome silence. 



They walked for another half- 
hour and then he called another 
halt. By now he was drenched with 
sweat and it gave him little comfort 
to realize that the girls were no 
cooler. 

He glanced up at the sun. It 
seemed to be almost directly over- 
head. He saw an outcropping of 
rock and went over to sit in its 
shade. The girls joined him, still 
complaining to each other in their 
own language. Helward regretted he 
had not taken more trouble to learn 
local speech — he could pick out one 
or two phrases, but only enough to 
discover that he was the butt of most 
of the complaints. 

He opened a packet of dehy- 
drated food and moistened it with 
water from the canteen. The 
resultant gray soup looked and 
tasted like sour porridge. Per- 
versely, he derived pleasure from 
the girls’ renewed complaints — here 
was one occasion when they were 
justified and he wasn’t going to give 
them the satisfaction of letting them 
see he agreed. 

The baby was still asleep, but 
fretting in the heat. Helward 
guessed that if they moved again it 
would wake up, so when the girls 
stretched out on the ground for a 
nap he made no effort to dissuade 
them. 

While they were relaxing Helward 
stared back at the city, still clearly 
visible a couple of miles away. He 
realized that he had not been taking 
note of the marks left by the cable 



INVERTED WORLD 



159 




stay emplacements. They would 
have passed only one so far — and 
now that he thought about it he saw 
what Clausewitz had meant by 
saying they left clearly distinguish- 
able scars in the earth. He recalled 
that they had passed one a few 
minutes before they had halted. The 
marks left by the sleepers were 
shallow depressions some five feet in 
length by twelve inches across, but 
where the cable stays had been 
hurried were deep pits, surrounded 
by upturned soil. 

Mentally, he marked off the first 
one. Thirty-seven to go. 

In spite of their slow progress he 
still saw no reason why he should not 
be 'back in the city in time for the 
birth of his own child. After he had 
seen the women back to their village 
he could make good progress on his 
own, however unpleasant the con- 
ditions. 

H e decided to allow the girls an 
hour for their rest and when he 
estimated that it had passed he went 
and stood over them. 

Caterina opened her eyes and 
looked up at him. 

“Come on,” he said. “I want to 
move on.” 

“Is too hot.” 

“Is too bad,” he said. “We’re 
moving.” 

She stood up, stretching her body 
elaborately, then spoke to the other 
two. With similar reluctance they 
stood up and Rosario went to look at 
the baby. To Helward’s dismay she 



woke it — but fortunately the crying 
did not start again. Without delay, 
Helward gave back the two holdalls 
to Caterina and Lucia and picked 
up his own two packs. 

Now the full heat of the sun came 
down on them and within a few 
seconds the benefit of the rest in the 
shade seemed to vanish. They had 
gone only a few yards when Rosario 
passed the baby to Lucia. 

She went back to the rocks and 
disappeared behind them. Helward 
opened his mouth to ask where she 
had gone — but then realized. When 
she returned, Lucia went, and then 
Caterina. Helward felt his anger 
returning. They were deliberately 
delaying him. He felt a pressure in 
his own bladder, aggravated by 
realizing what the girls had been 
doing, but his anger and pride 
would not allow him to relieve him- 
self. He decided to wait until later. 

They walked on. The girls had 
now discarded the jackets that were 
common apparel inside the city and 
wore only the trousers and shirts. 
The thin material, damp with per- 
spiration, adhered to their bodies 
and Helward noticed this with a des- 
pondent interest, reflecting that 
under different circumstances he 
might have found the phenomenon 
of considerable potential. As things 
were he registered this new develop- 
ment only so far as to appreciate 
that each of the girls was of fuller 
figure than Victoria — Rosario in 
particular had large, pendulous 
breasts with protuberant nipples. 



160

Later, one of the girls must have 
noticed his occasional glance, for 
soon all three of them were walking 
with their jackets held over their 
chests. It made no difference to 
Helward — he just wanted to be rid 
of them. 

“We have water?” Lucia asked, 
coming over to him. 

He rummaged in the pack and 
gave her the canteen. She drank 
some, then moistened the palms of 
her hands and splashed water over 
her face and neck. Rosario and 
Caterina did likewise. The sight and 
sound of the water were too much 
for Helward and his bladder 
protested anew. He looked around. 
There was no cover, so he walked 
some yards away from the girls and 
relieved himself onto the soil. 
Behind him, he heard giggling. 

When he returned, Caterina held 
out the canteen to him. He took it* 
and raised it to his lips. Suddenly 
Caterina tipped it from below and 
the water splashed over his nose and 
eyes. The girls screamed with laugh- 
ter as he spluttered and choked. The 
baby started crying again. 

XV 

T hey passed two more cable- 
stay emplacement marks be- 
fore Helward decided to pitch camp 
for the night. He selected a site near 
a clump of trees two or three hun- 
dred yards from the scars made by 
the tracks. A small brook flowed 
nearby and after testing it for 



purity — he had no guide other than 
his own palate — he declared it safe 
for drinking to conserve the supply 
in the canteens. 

The tent was relatively simple to 
erect and although he started the 
work on his own the girls helped him 
finish off. As soon as it was up he 
laid the sleeping bags inside and 
Rosario went in to feed the baby. 

When the baby had gone to sleep 
again, Lucia helped Helward recon- 
stitute the synthetic food. The result 
this time was an orange-colored 
soup and it tasted no better than 
before. The sun set as they were 
eating. Helward had lit a small fire, 
but soon a wind blew up from the 
east, chilling them. Finally they 
were forced into the tent and the 
sleeping bags for warmth. 

Helward tried to strike up a con- 
versation with the girls, but either 
they did not answer or they giggled 
or made joking references to each 
other in Spanish, so he soon 
abandoned the idea. There were a 
few small candles in the pack of 
equipment and Helward lay in the 
light of these for an hour or two, 
wondering what possible benefit the 
city could derive from this pointless 
expedition of his. 

He fell asleep at last, but was 
wakened twice in the night by the 
baby’s crying. On one occasion he 
could just make out the shape of 
Rosario against the dim glow from 
outside, sitting up in her sleeping 
bag and suckling the infant. 

They were awake early and set off 



INVERTED WORLD 



161 




as soon as they could. Helward 
wasn’t sure of what had happened, 
but the mood of the girls today was 
obviously different. As they walked 
Caterina and Lucia sang a little and 
at their first stop they tried again to 
spill water on him. He moved back 
to avoid them, but in doing so 
stumbled on the uneven ground — 
and spluttered and choked once 
more for their amusement. Only 
Rosario maintained a distance, 
pointedly ignoring him as Lucia and 
Caterina played up to him. He 
didn’t enjoy being teased — for he 
could think of no way of replying — 
but he preferred it to the bad feeling 
of the day before. 

As the morning progressed and 
the temperature rose, their mood 
became more careless. None of the 
three girls wore her jacket, and at 
the next stop Lucia undid the top 
two buttons of her shirt and 
Caterina opened hers all the way 
down the front, holding it in place 
with a large knot and so baring her 
midriff. 

By now Helward could not mis- 
take the effect they were having on 
him. As familiarity grew, the atmos- 
phere eased further. Even Rosario 
did not turn her back on him the 
next time she suckled her baby. 

Relief from the heat came with 
another patch of woodland, one 
Helward could remember helping to 
clear for the track-layers some miles 
before. They sat down in the 
shadows, waiting for the worst of the 
heat to pass. 



They had now passed a total of 
five cable stay scars — thirty-three to 
go. Helward’s mood of frustration 
at the slowness of their journey was 
easing. He saw that to travel foster 
would hardly have been possible 
even if he had been alone. The 
ground was too difficult, the sun too 
hot. 

H e decided to wait for two 
hours in the shadow of the 
trees. Rosario had moved some way 
away from him and was playing with 
her baby. Caterina and Lucia sat 
together under a tree. They had 
taken off their shoes and were 
talking quietly together. Helward 
closed his eyes for a few minutes, 
but soon became restless. He 
walked out of the trees on his own 
and went down to the scars left by 
the four lines of track. He looked 
left and right, north and south: the 
line ran straight and true, undulat- 
ing slightly with the rise and fall of 
the ground, but always maintaining 
its direction. 

Enjoying the comparative soli- 
tude he stood there for some time, 
wishing the weather would change 
and the sky cloud over, if only 
temporarily. He debated with 
himself for a while, trying to decide 
whether it might be better to rest 
during the days and travel at 
night — but considered on balance 
that to do so would be too risky. 

He was about to turn back to the 
trees when he suddenly saw a move- 
ment about a mile to the south of 



162 



GALAXY 




him. At once he was on his guard 
and dropped to the ground behind a 
tree stump. He waited. 

In a moment he saw someone 
walking up the track toward him. 

Helward remembered the cross- 
bow folded inside his pack — but al- 
ready it was too late to go back for it. 
There was a bush just a yard or two 
to the side of the stump and he 
wriggled over until he was behind it. 
Now better covered, he hoped he 
might not be seen. 

The figure was still coming to- 
ward him and Helward saw to his 
surprise that the man was wearing 
the uniform of a guild apprentice. 
His first impulse was to come out of 
hiding, but he fought this back and 
stayed put. 

When the man was less than fifty 
yards away, Helward recognized 
Torrold Pelham, a boy several miles 
older than himself who had left the 
creche a considerable time before. 

Helward broke cover and stood 
up. 

“Torrold!” 

At once, Pelham was on his 
guard. He raised his crossbow and 
aimed it at Helward — then slowly 
lowered it. 

“Torrold — it’s me. Helward 
Mann.” 

“God, what are you doing here?” 

They laughed together, realizing 
that they were both here for the 
same reason. 

“You’ve grown up,” said Pel- 
ham. “You were just a kid the last 
time I saw you.” 



“Have you been down past?” Hel- 
ward asked. 

“Yes.” Pelham stared past him, 
northward up the track. 

“Well?” 

“It’s not what I thought.” 
“What’s there?” 

“You’re down past now. Can’t 
you feel it?” 

“Feel what?” 

Pelham looked at him for a mo- 
ment. “It’s not so bad here. But you 
can feel it. Perhaps you can’t yet 
recognize it. It builds up quickly 
farther south.” 

“What does? You’re talking in 
riddles.” 

“No — it’s impossible to explain.” 
Pelham glanced toward the north 
again. “Is the city near here?” 

“A few miles. Not far.” 

“What happened to it? Have they 
found some way to make it move 
faster? I’ve only been gone a short 
time and the city’s moved much 
farther than I thought it would.” 
“It’s gone no faster than nor- 
mal.” 

“There’s a creek back there 
where a bridge had been built. 
When was that done?” 

“About nine miles ago.” 

Pelham shook his head. “It 
doesn’t make sense.” 

“You’ve lost your feel of time, 
that’s all.” 

Pelham suddenly grinned. “I ex- 
pect that’s it. Listen, are you on your 
own?” 

“No,” said Helward. “I’ve got 
three girls with me.” 



INVERTED WORLD 



163 




“What are they like?” 

“They’re okay. A bit difficult at 
first, but we’re getting to know each 
other now.’ 

“Good-lookers are they?” 

“Not bad. Come and see.” 
Helward led the way back 
through the trees until the girls 
came into view. 

Pelham whistled. “Hey — they’re 
all right. Have you — you know?” 
“No.” 

They walked back toward the 
track. 

Pelham said: “Are you going to?” 
“I’m not sure.” 

“Take a tip, Helward — if you’re 
going to, do it soon. Otherwise it’ll 
be too late.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“You’ll see.” 

Pelham gave him a cheery grin, 
then continued on his way north. 

T houghts and intentions in the 
direction to which Pelham had 
been alluding were put out of 
Helward’s mind almost at once. 
Rosario fed her baby before they set 
off and they had been walking only a 
few minutes when the child was vio- 
lently sick. 

Rosario hugged it to her, croon- 
ing quietly, but there was little any- 
one could do. Lucia stood by her, 
speaking sympathetically to her. 
Helward was worried, because if the 
child were seriously ill there was not 
much else they could do but return 
to the city. Soon, though, the baby 
stopped retching, and after a lusty 



crying session it quieted down. 

“Do you want to go on?” Helward 
asked Rosario. 

She shrugged helplessly. “Si.” 

They walked on more slowly. The 
heat had not abated much, and sev- 
eral times Helward asked the girls if 
they wanted to stop. Each time they 
said no, but Helward detected that a 
subtle change had come over all four 
of them. It was as if the minor 
tragedy had drawn them together. 

“We’ll camp tonight,” said 
Helward. “And rest all day to- 
morrow.” 

There was agreement to this and 
when Rosario fed the baby again a 
little later, this time it kept the milk 
down. 

Just before nightfall they passed 
through countryside more hilly and 
rocky than that they had seen so far 
and suddenly came to the chasm 
that had caused so much trouble to 
the Bridge Builders. There was not 
much sign now of where the bridge 
had been, although the foundations 
of the suspension towers had left two 
large scars in the ground on this 
side. 

Helward remembered a patch of 
level ground on the northern bank 
of the stream at the bottom of the 
chasm and he led the way down. 

Rosario and Lucia fussed over the 
baby, while Caterina helped Hel- 
ward erect the tent. Suddenly, while 
they were laying out the four 
sleeping bags inside, Caterina put a 
hand on his neck and kissed him 
lightly on the cheek. 



164 



GALAXY 




He grinned at her. “What’s that 
for?” 

“You okay with Rosario.” 

Helward stayed put, thinking 
that the kiss might be repeated, but 
Caterina crawled backward from 
the tent and called the others. 

The baby looked better and fell 
asleep when it was put into its 
makeshift cot. Rosario said nothing 
about the child, but Helward could 
tell she felt less worried. 

The evening was much warmer 
than the night before and after they 
had eaten they stayed outside the 
tent for some time. Lucia was con- 
cerned with her feet, rubbing them 
continually, and the other girls 
seemed to be making much of this. 
She showed her feet to Helward, and 
he saw that large blisters had ap- 
peared on the outer sides of her toes. 
Feet were compared at great length, 
the other girls saying that theirs 
were sore too. 

“Tomorrow,” said Lucia, “no 
shoes.” 

That seemed to be an end to it. 

Helward waited outside the tent 
as the girls crawled in. The previous 
night had been so cold that all of 
them had slept with their clothes on 
inside the sleeping bags, but tonight 
was warm and humid. A certain 
coyness in Helward made .him 
resolve that he would keep his own 
clothes on and sleep on top of the 
bag, but a fast-developing interest 
in the girls led his thoughts to wilder 
fantasies about what they might do. 
After a few minutes he crawled into 



the tent. The candles were alight. 

Each of the three girls was inside 
her own bag, although Helward saw 
from the pile of clothes that they had 
undressed. He said nothing to them, 
but blew out the candles and 
undressed in the dark, stumbling 
and falling clumsily in the process. 
He lay down, only too aware of 
Caterina’s body lying close beside 
him in the next sleeping bag. He 
stayed awake for a long time, trying 
to rid himself of a fierce manifesta- 
tion of his arousal. Victoria seemed 
to be a long way away. 

XVI 

I T WAS daylight when he awoke 
and, after a futile attempt to get 
dressed while still in his sleeping 
bag, Helward scrambled out of the 
tent naked and dressed hurriedly 
outside. He lit the campfire and 
began to heat some water to make 
synthetic tea. 

Here at the bottom of the chasm it 
was already warm and Helward 
wondered again whether they 
should move on or rest for a day as 
he had promised. 

The water boiled and he sipped 
his tea. He heard movement from 
inside the tent. In a moment Cate- 
rina came out and walked past him 
toward the stream. 

Helward stared after her — she 
was wearing only her shirt, un- 
buttoned all down the front and 
swinging open, and a pair of pants. 
When she reached the water she 



INVERTED WORLD 



165 




turned and waved back at him. 

“Come!” she called. 

Helward needed no further 
bidding. He went down to her, feel- 
ing clumsy in his uniform and 
metal-studded boots. 

“We swim?” she said and with- 
out waiting for an answer slipped off 
her shirt, stepped out of her pants 
and waded down into the water. 
Helward glanced back at the tent — 
nothing moved. 

In a few seconds he had taken off 
his clothes and was splashing 
through the shallows toward her. 
She turned and faced him, grinning 
when she saw the response in him 
she had caused. She splashed water 
at him and turned away. Helward 
leaped at her, getting his arms 
around her — and together they fell 
sideways full-length into the water. 

Caterina wriggled free of him and 
stood up. She skipped away from 
him through the shallows, throwing 
up a huge spray. Helward followed 
and caught her at the bank. Her 
face was serious. She raised her 
arms around his neck and pulled his 
face down to hers. They kissed for a 
few moments, then clambered out 
of the water and into the long grass 
growing on the bank. They lay 
down together and started to kiss 
again, more deeply. 

By the time they had disentang- 
led, gotten dressed and returned to 
the tent, Rosario and Lucia were 
eating a pile of yellow gruel. Neither 
of them said anything, but Helward 
saw Lucia smile at Caterina. 



Half an hour later the baby was 
sick again — and as Rosario was 
holding it concernedly, she sudden- 
ly thrust the baby into Lucia’s arms 
and rushed away. A few seconds 
later, she could be heard retching 
beside the stream. 

Helward asked Caterina, “Do 
you feel okay?” 

“Yes.” 

Helward sniffed the food they had 
been eating. It smelled normal — 
unappetizing, but not tainted. A 
few minutes later Lucia complained 
of intense stomach pains. She was 
very pale. 

Caterina wandered away. 

Helward was desperate. The only 
course open to him now seemed to 
be to return to the city. If their food 
had become foul, how would they 
survive the rest of the journey? 

After a while Rosario returned to 
the campsite. She looked weak and 
pale.and sat down on the ground in 
the shade. Lucia gave her some 
water from the canteen. Lucia 
herself looked white and was hold- 
ing her stomach, and the baby con- 
tinued to scream. Helward was not 
prepared to cope with a situation 
like this and hadn’t the least idea of 
what to suggest. 

He went m search of Caterina, 
who had seemed to be unaffected. 

About a hundred yards down the 
chasm he came across her. She was 
walking back toward the campsite 
with an armful of apples which, she 
said, she had found growing wild. 
They looked red and ripe and

GALAXY 




Helward tasted one. It was sweet 
and juicy — but then he remember- 
ed Ciausewitz’s warning. His reason 
told him Clausewitz was wrong, but 
reluctantly he gave it to Caterina 
and she ate the rest. 

They baked one of the apples in 
the embers of the fire, and then 
pulped it. In tiny mouthfuls, they 
fed it to the baby. This time it kept 
the food down and made happy 
noises. Rosario was still too weak to 
attend to it, so Caterina laid it down 
on its cot and within minutes it was 
asleep. 

Lucia was not sick, although her 
stomach continued to give her pain 
for most of the morning. Rosario 
recovered more quickly, and ate one 
of the apples. 

Helward ate the rest of the yellow 
synthetic food — and it did not make 
him ill. 

1 ATER in the day Helward climbed 
jup to the top of the creek and 
walked along its northern side. 
Here, a few miles back in time, lives 
had been lost in the cause of getting 
the city to cross this chasm. The 
scene was still familiar to him, and 
although most of the equipment 
used by the city had been collected, 
those long days and nights spent 
racing to complete the bridge were 
still very vivid in his memory. He 
looked across to the south at the 
exact spot where the bridge had 
been built. 

The gap did not look as wide as it 
had then, nor did the chasm look as 



deep. Perhaps his excitement at the 
time had exaggerated his impres- 
sion of the obstacle the chasm pre- 
sented. 

But no — surely the chasm had 
been wider? 

He remembered that when the 
city had been crossing the bridge the 
railway itself had been at least sixty 
yards long. Now it seemed that at 
the point the bridge had been built 
the chasm was only about ten yards 
wide. 

Helward stood and stared at the 
opposite edge for a long time, not 
understanding how this apparent 
contradiction could occur. Then an 
idea came to him. 

The bridge had been built to quite 
exact engineering specifications — 
he had worked for many days on the 
building of the suspension towers 
and he knew that the two towers on 
each side of the chasm had been 
built an exact distance apart to 
allow the city to pass between them. 

That distance was about one hun- 
dred and thirty feet or forty paces. 

He went to the place where one of 
the northern towers had been built 
and walked over towards its twin. 
He counted fifty-eight paces. 

He went back, tried again. This 
time he made it sixty paces. 

He tried again, taking larger 
steps — fifty-five paces. 

Standing on the edge of the 
chasm he stared down at the stream 
below. He could remember with 
great clarity the depth of the creek 
when the bridge was being built. 



INVERTED WORLD 



167 




From where he now stood, the 
bottom of the chasm had seemed to 
be a terrifying depth below. Now it 
was an easy climb down to where he 
and the women had camped. 

Another thought struck him and 
he strode north to where the ramp 
had brought the city down into 
contact with the soil again. The 
traces of the four tracks still showed 
clearly. 

If the two towers were now 
apparently farther apart — what of 
the distance covered by the tracks? 

From long hours of working with 
Malchuskin Helward knew inti- 
mately every detail of the tracks and 
their sleepers. The gauge of the 
tracks was three and a half feet, 
resting on sleepers five feet long. 
LxKtking now at the scars left in the 
ground by the sleepers, he saw that 
they were much bigger than this. He 
made a rough measurement and 
estimated that the marks were now 
at least seven feet long and shallow- 
er than they ought to be. But he 
knew that the sleepers he had used 
could not have made them — the city 
used standard-length sleepers, and 
the pits dug for them were always 
roughly the same size. 

To make sure he checked several 
more scars and found they were all 
apparently two feet longer than they 
should have been. 

And too close together. The 
sleepers were laid by the track crews 
at four feet intervals — not about 
eighteen inches apart, as these were. 

Helward spent a few more 



minutes making similar measure- 
ments, then scrambled down the 
chasm, waded across the stream 
(which now seemed to him to be 
narrower and shallower than it had 
been before) and climbed up to the 
southern edge. 

Here, too, the measurements he 
made of the remains of the city’s 
passage were in stark c iflict with 
what they should have been. 

Puzzled — and more than a little 
worried — he returned to the camp. 

The girls were all looking 
healthier, but the baby had again 
been sick. The girls told him that 
they had been eating the apples 
Caterina had found. He cut one in 
half and inspected it closely. He 
could see no difference between it 
and any other apple he had ever 
eaten. Once again he was tempted 
to eat it, but instead passed it to 
Lucia. 

An idea had suddenly occurred to 
him. 

C LAusEwiTz had warned him of 
eating local foods — presum- 
ably this was because he was of the 
city. Clausewitz had said it was all 
right to eat local foods when the city 
was near optimum, but that some 
miles to the south, it would not be 
safe. If he ate the city food, he would 
not be ill. 

But the girls — they were not of the 
city. Perhaps it was his food that was 
making them ill. They could eat city 
food when they were near the opti- 
mum, but not now. 



168 



GALAXY 




It made a kind of sense, but for 
one thing; the baby. Except for a 
few tiny mouthfuls of apple, it had 
had nothing but its mother’s milk. 
Surely that could not harm it? 

He went with Rosario to see the 
baby. It lay in its crib, its face red 
and tear-stained. It was not crying 
now, but it fretted weakly. Helward 
felt sorry for the tiny creature and 
wondered what he could do to help. 

Outside the tent, Lucia and 
Caterina were in good spirits. They 
spoke to Helward as he emerged, 
but he walked on past them and 
went to sit beside the stream . He was 
still thinking about his new idea. 

The only food had been its 
mother’s milk . suppose the 
mother were different now, away 
from the optimum? She was not of 
the city, but the baby was. Could 
that make a difference? It did not 
make much sense — for surely the 
baby was of the mother’s body — but 
it was a possibility. 

He went back to the camp and 
made up some synthetic food and 
dried milk, being careful to use only 
water he had brought from the city. 
He gave it to Rosario and told her to 
try feeding the baby with it. 

She resisted the idea at first, but 
then relented. The baby took the 
food and two hours later it was 
sleeping peacefully once more. 

The day passed slowly. Down in 
the creek the air was still and warm 
and Helward’s feeling of frustration 
returned. He saw now that if his 
suppositions were correct he could 

INVERTED WORLD 



no longer offer the girls any of the 
food. But with thirty or more miles 
to walk, they couldn’t survive on 
apples alone. 

Later he told them what was on 
his mind and suggested that for the 
moment they should eat very small 
amounts of his food and supple- 
ment this with whatever they could 
find locally. They seemed puzzled, 
but agreed to this. 

The sweltering afternoon con- 
tinued — and Helward’s restlessness 
was transmitted to the girls. They 
became light-hearted and firisky and 
teased him about his bulky uniform. 
Caterina said she was going for an- 
other swim. Lucia said she would 
go, too. They stripped in front of 
him and then turned on him play- 
fully and made him undress. They 
splashed about naked in the water 
for a long time, joined later by 
Rosario whose attitude toward him 
no longer seemed to be one of sus- 
picion. 

For the rest of the day they lay on 
the ground beside the tent, sun- 
bathing. 

That night Lucia took Helward’s 
hand just as he was about to go into 
the tent and led him away from the 
campsite. She made love to him 
passionately, holding him tightly 
against her as if he were the only 
force of reality in her world. 

I N THE morning Helward sensed a 
growing jealousy between Lucia 
and Caterina. He broke camp as 
early as possible. 

169 




He led them across the stream 
and up to the higher land to the 
south. Following the left outer track 
they continued their journey. The 
surrounding countryside was fa- 
miliar to Helward — this was the 
region through v'hich the city had 
been passing when he first worked 
outside. Some two miles to the south 
lay the ridge of high ground where 
he had witnessed his first winching. 

They stopped for a rest halfway 
through the morning. Then Hel- 
ward remembered that only two 
miles to the west of where they were 
was a small local settlement. It 
occurred to him that if food could be 
obtained there the problem of what 
the girls could eat would be solved. 
He suggested this to them. 

The problem arose of who was to 
go. He felt he should go himself be- 
cause the responsibility was his, but 
he would need one of the girls be- 
cause she could speak the language. 
He did not wish to leave just one of 
the girls alone with the baby and he 
felt that if he went with either Cate- 
rina or Lucia, the one left behind 
would show more obviously what he 
had guessed was their shared jea- 
lousy over him. In the end he 
suggested that Rosario should go 
with him and the reception ac- 
corded to his decision assured him 
that he had made the right choice. 

They set off in the approximate 
direction Helward remembered and 
found the village without difficulty. 
After a long conversation between 
Rosario and three of the local men. 



they were given some dried meat 
and some green, raw vegetables. 
Everything went remarkably 
smoothly — Helward wondered what 
kind of persuasions she had used — 
and soon they were returning to the 
others. 

W alking along a few yards behind 
Rosario, Helward noticed some- 
thing about the girl he had not seen 
before. 

She was built rather more heavily 
than the other two girls, and her 
arms and face were round and 
well-fleshed. The girl did have a 
slight tendency to plumpness, but it 
suddenly seemed to Helward that 
this was much more noticeable than 
before. With casual interest at 
first — and greater attention later — 
he saw that the fabric of her shirt 
was stretched tightly across her 
back. But her clothes had not been 
as tight as that before — they had 
been given to her in the city and had 
fitted her well. Then Helward 
noticed the trousers she was 
wearing: they were tight across her 
seat, but the legs scuffed against the 
ground as she walked. True, she was 
without shoes, but even so he did not 
remember her trouser legs’ being as 
long as this before. 

He caught up with her and 
walked at her side. 

The shirt was tight across her 
chest, compressing her breasts — 
and the sleeves were too long. Also, 
the girl seemed to be far shorter 
than he remembered her from even 
the day before. 



170 



GALAXY 




When they joined the others, Hel- 
ward noticed that their clothes, too, 
were now fitting them badly. 
Caterina had her shirt knotted 
across her stomach as before, but 
Lucia’s was buttoned and the 
tightness of the fit caused the fabric 
to part between the buttons. 

H e tried to put the phenome- 
non out of his mind, but as they 
continued southward it seemed to 
become more and more obvious — 
and with comic results. Bending 
down to attend to the baby, Rosario 
split the seat of her trousers. One of 
Lucia’s buttons popped off as she 
raised the canteen of water to her 
lips and Caterina tore the fabric of 
her shirt down both seams below her 
armpits. 

A mile or so farther down the 
track, Lucia lost two more buttons. 
Her shirt was now open down most 
of its front and she knotted it as 
Caterina had done. All three girls 
had turned up the hems of their 
trousers and it was clear they were 
suffering considerable discomfort. 

Helward called a halt in the lee of 
the ridge and set up camp. Once 
they had eaten the girls took off 
their tattered clothes and went into 
the tent. They teased Helward about 
his own clothes: were they not 
going to be tom up, too? He sat 
outside the tent on his own, not yet 
sleepy and not wishing to sit inside 
the tent with the girls. 

The baby started to cry, and 
Rosario came out of the tent to get it 



some food. Helward spoke to her, 
but she did not reply. He watched 
her as she added water to the dried 
milk, looked at her naked body in a 
wholly unsexual way. He had seen 
her naked only the day before and 
he was certain she had not looked as 
she now seemed. She had been 
almost as tall as he was — now she 
was squat and plump. 

“Rosario, is Caterina still 
awake?” 

She nodded wordlessly and went 
back into the tent. A few moments 
later Caterina came out and 
Helward stood up. 

They faced each other in the light 
from the campfire. Caterina said 
nothing and Helward did not know 
what to say. She, too, had changed. 
A moment later Lucia came out to 
stand at Caterina’s side. 

Now he was certain. Some time 
during the day the girls’ physical ap- 
pearance had changed. 

He looked at them both. Yester- 
day, naked beside the stream, their 
bodies had been long and lithe, their 
breasts round and full. 

Now their arms and legs were 
shorter and more thickly built. 
Their shoulders and hips were 
broader, their breasts less round 
and more widely spaced . Their faces 
were rounder, their necks were 
shorter. 

They came to him and stood be- 
fore him. Lucia took the clasp of his 
trousers in her hands. Her lips were 
moist. From the entrance to the 
tent, Rosario watched. 



INVERTED WORLD 



171 




XVII 

I N THE morning Helward saw that 
the girls had changed even 
further during the course of the 
night. He estimated that none now 
stood taller than five feet. They 
also talked m'ore quickly than 
before and the pitch of their voices 
was higher. 

None of them could get into the 
clothes. Lucia tried, but could not 
get her legs into the trousers and 
split the sleeves of her shirt. When 
they left the camp, the girls’ clothes 
were left, too, and they continued on 
their way naked. 

Helward could not take his eyes 
off them. Every hour that passed 
seemed to reveal a more obvious 
change in them. Their legs were now 
so short that they could only take 
small steps and he was forced to 
dawdle so that he would not leave 
them behind. In addition, he 
noticed that as they walked their 
posture was assuming an angle — 
they appeared to be leaning 
backward. 

They were also watching him and 
when they stopped for water an un- 
canny silence prevailed while the 
strange group passed the canteen 
from one to the other. 

Around them there were outward 
signs of an inexplicable change in 
the scenery. The remains of the left 
outer track, which they still follow- 
ed, were not indistinct. The last 
clear impression Helward had seen 
of one of the sleeper pits had been 



more than forty feet in length and 
less than an inch in depth. The next 
set of tracks, the left inner, could 
not be seen — gradually the strip be- 
tween the two had widened until it 
was over to the east by a half-mile or 
more. 

The incidence of stay emplace- 
ments had increased. That morning 
they had already passed twelve and 
by Helward’s figures there were only 
nine more to go. 

But how would he recognize the 
girls’ settlement? The natural 
scenery of the area was flat and 
uniform. They seemed to be resting 
on some hardened residue of an an- 
cient lava-flow — no shade or shel- 
ter was in sight. He looked more 
closely at the ground. If he moved 
his figures through it firmly he could 
still make shallow indentations in 
the soil, but although the dirt was 
loose and sandy it felt thick and 
viscous to the touch. 

The girls were now no more than 
three feet tall, and their bodies had 
distorted even further. Their feet 
were flat and wide, their legs broad 
and short, their torsos round and 
compressed. In this perception of 
them they became grotesquely ugly, 
and he found that in spite of his fas- 
cination with the physical changes 
coming over them the sound of their 
twittering voices was irritating him. 

Only the baby had not changed. 
It was still, as far as Helward could 
see, much as it had always been. But 
in relation to its mother it was now 
disproportionately large and the 



172 



GALAXY 




squat figure that was Rosario was 
regarding it with a kind of unspoken 
horror. 

The baby was of the city. 

Just as Helward himself had been 
born of a woman from outside, so 
was Rosario’s baby a child of the 
city. Whatever transformation was 
coming over the three girls and the 
countryside from which they came, 
neither he nor the baby were 
affected by it. 

Helward had no conception of 
what he should do, nor what he 
should make of what he saw. 

He tried to think. 

He felt a growing fright, for this 
was beyond any comprehension he 
had ever had of the natural order of 
things. The evidence was mani- 
fest — the rationale was without 
terms of reference. 

He looked to the south and saw 
that not too far away stood a line of 
hills. From their shape and overall 
height he assumed they must be the 
foothills of some larger range — but 
then he noticed with a surge of 
alarm that the tops of the hills were 
white with snow. The sun was as hot 
as ever and the air as warm — logic 
demanded that any snow that could 
exist in this climate must be on the 
tops of very high mountains. And 
yet they were near enough — no more 
than a mile or two, he thought — for 
him to judge that at most they were 
only about five hundred feet in 
elevation. 

He stood up — and suddenly fell. 

As he hit the ground he found he 



was rolling, as if down a steep slope, 
toward the south. He managed to 
stop himself and stood up un- 
steadily, bracing himself against a 
force that was pulling him south- 
ward. The effect was not new — he 
had been feeling a strange pressure 
all morning — but the fall had taken 
him by surprise and the force 
seemed now far stronger than 
before. Why had it not affected him 
until this moment? He thought 
back. That morning, with the other 
distractions, he realized he had in- 
deed been aware of it — and had felt 
in the back of his mind that he had 
been walking down a long hill. But 
that was clearly nonsensical; the 
land was level as far as the eye could 
see. He stood by the group of girls, 
sampling the sensation. 

It was not like the pressure of air, 
nor even like the pull of gravity on a 
slope. It was somewhere between 
the two: on level ground, without 
noticeable air movements, he felt as 
though he were being pushed or 
dragged south. 

He took a few steps to the north, 
and realized he was bracing his legs 
as if ascending a hill — he turned to 
face south and, in conflict with the 
evidence of his eyes, he felt as 
though he were on a steep slope. 

The girls were watching him 
curiously as he went back to them. 

He saw that in those last few 
minutes their bodies had distorted 
still further.

READ ANY GOOD 
MONSTEiiS umyp 



Remember the glaks, broknips, 
rizbhus, clqzts, hauhugs and 
other marvelous monsters that 
stirred your imagination and 
swept you away to a world of 
pure delight? You’ll find them 
romping and stomping through 
some of the most imaginative 
stories that ever stretched your 
mind — the kind of reading you 
simply won't be able to put 
down. 

Take advantage of our mon- 
strous offer. Any 4 of the latest 
science fiction best sellers 
listed below can be yours for 
just 100! Choose any 4 books 
including, if you wish, the most 
prized book of the year: the 
064 page double-volume col- 
lection of HUGO WINNERS— 
23 short stories that have won 
the science fiction equivalent 
of the Oscar (a $15.45 value). 

Here’s how the Club works: 

When your application for mem- 
bership is accepted, you’ll re- 
ceive your choice of 4 books 




for just 100 (plus shipping and 
handling). If not absolutely fas- 
cinated, return them within ten 
days — membership will be can- 
celled and you’ll owe nothing. 
About every 4 weeks (14 times 
a year), we’ll send you the 
Club’s bulletin describing the 



2 coming Selections and Alter- 
nate choices. If you want both 
Selections, you need do noth- 
ing; they’ll be shipped auto- 
matically. If you don’t want a 
Selection, or prefer an Alter- 
nate, or no book at all, lust fill 
out the form provided, and re- 
turn it by the date specified. 
We try to allow you at least 
ten days to make your deci- 
sion. If you don’t get the form 
in time to respond within 10 
days, and receive an unwanted 
selection, you may return it at 
our expense. 

As a member you need take 
only 4 Selections or Alternates 
during the coming year. You 
may resign any time thereafter, 
or continue membership. Most 
books cost only $1.49, plus 
shipping and handling. Occa- 
sionally, extra-value Selections 
are slightly higher, but always 
much less than Publishers’ Edi- 
tions. So join now. Send no 
money. But do mail the cou- 
pon today.
