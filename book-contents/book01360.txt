Readers write — and wrong! 



GOOD READERS: Did you ever get 
a letter from a guy who doesn’t quite 
believe his senses — who keeps trying 
to look behind everything he sees and 
listens for hidden meanings in all he 
hears? Who titters wetly when he 
talks? I’ve just read one of those for 
about the fifth time, trying to put it 
into printable shape and now I have 
it. But I can’t bring myself to print it 
— rfor his sake and mine. 

But I’ll answer it. The writer ad- 
mits to being “a bit suspicious” be- 
cause transfer of GALAXY and IF 
to new ownership inevitably led to 
certain schedule and other compli- 
cations. Despite repeated assurances 
that changes of date on the cover and 
a delayed issue did not mean that he 
would get fewer consecutive copies 
than his subscription called for, he 
has decided to buy us on the news- 
stands. That’s okay. We’re ahead 
when you buy on the stands — you’re 
ahead when you subscribe. Come 
back when you’re ready and your 
mind’s at rest. 

The rest of the letter has no par- 
ticular pertinence — so we file it in the 



round and go on. I’ve saved this 
month’s space specifically for readers 
concerned with IF / GALAXY’s 
change of address and management. 
Most have rolled nicely with the 
punches right along with us. 

I particularly like the following: 

Dear Mr. Jakobs son: 

Seeing as how Hue and Cry has 
been miraculously preserved in the 
Great Changeover, I thought that I 
would be one of the readers to “ Write 
— or Wrong." 

And believe me, I really don’t 
know what to say. We really haven’t 
seen exactly what your tastes are in 
sf Makes it sorta hard on prospective 
writers, don’t it? 

I must say, though, that from what 
I have heard, you seem to have good 
taste. A friend of mine says of the 
magazine you originally edited: "It 
usually published stories of /IS- 
TOUN DING quality — but which 
Campbell didn’t like." If the rates are 
going to be better now that you are in

EDITOR’S PAGE 

I anticipate great, rollicking good 
times for all of us in the next decade 
or so, an anticipation tempered only 
by a minor frustration. As the old say- 
ing goes: all that blood in the gutter 
and me without a spoon. 

The springboard for my optimism 
is an editorial by John W. Campbell 
(. Analog , October, 1969) and if you 
haven’t already seen a copy, don’t 
bother. The salient points are covered 
here and in the November Galaxy , 
now at your newsstands. And the De- 
cember Galaxy will bring you a bril- 
liant novel by T. J. Bass, complete in 
one issue, of an Earth Society domi- 
nated by four-toed Nebishes, who are 
curiously — if unintentionally — evoca- 
tive of Mr. Campbell’s docile Scots. 

Mr. Campbell argues for a genetic 
study of “differences” in intelligence 
in U.S., based on skin color. Black 
and White are the words he uses — 
and correctly. Considering all the 
places where George Washington and 
other prominent Caucasoids — some of 
them Scots — have slept, to call to- 
day’s Afro-Americans a race would be 
genetically fallacious. And there is the 
embarrassing factor of the founder of 
the NAACP, a white-skinned, blue- 
eyed blond named White, whom some 
naive Caucasoids witlessly invited to 
attend lynchings of Negroes. Mr. 
White, by our genetics a Negro and 
by Mr. Campbell’s White “Scholarly” 
standards a brilliantly successful 
novelist and newspaperman, wrote 
what many persons consider the first 
honest, though fairly devastating, 
analyses of Caucasoid “success” re- 
corded. 



Skintelligence 



Mr. Campbell obviously must 
claim him on the basis of color-suc- 
cess — though the late Walter Francis 
White would undoubtedly object wild- 

iy- 

Skintelligence? Make sense? 

One is tempted to wonder what 
planet Mr. Campbell inhabits. After 
mentioning the individual achieve- 
ments of a couple of Scots as proof 
of adaptability he writes, “The 
trouble is, today every effort is being 
made to suppress any study of differ- 
ence between Black and White . .” 
Such as, Mr. Campbell fails to point 
out, Chicago’s Black Surgeon Daniel 
Hale Williams’ successful open-heart 
surgery— the first by any surgeon 
anywhere in the world on a human 
being — during the latter part of the 
nineteenth century. One difference 
Dr. Williams’ skin color made was 
that until recently he was denied rec- 
ognition. 

And I suppose that in these inflated 
times nearly everyone knows at least 
a brace of millionaires. Mine happen 
to have high IQs — one has won inter- 
national recognition as an artist and a 
philanthropist in support of education 
and minorities — and both admit to 
amassing their piles by understanding 
money. Mr. Campbell cites a million- 
aire “with a tested IQ of 85” whose 
“solid reputation for unswerving hon- 
esty has helped him build his con- 
tracting business.” 

On what bleak and lying world is 
honesty priced so high? 

Mr. Campbell is made of strong 
stuff. On his planet I would rapidly 
become paranoid. — JAKOBSSON

T HEY stopped at the edge of 
the mountains eight hours af- 
ter they had left the hotel. The 
day was only a dim paling of the 
sky above the ragged skyline of 
rock to the east when they set up 
their shelter in a little level spot — 
a sort of nest among the granitic 
cliffs, ranging from fifty to three 
hundred meters high, surrounding 
them. 

With the approach of dawn the 
Udbahr natives trailing them had 
already begun to seek their own 
shelters, those cracks in the rock 
into which they would retreat un- 
til the relentless day had come 
and gone again and the light of 
theTiearer moon called them out. 
Already holed up high among 
the rocks, some of the males had 
begun to sing. 

“What’s he saying? What do 
the words mean?” demanded the 
girl graduate student, fascinated. 
Her name was Willy Fairchild and 
in the fading light of the nearer 
moon she showed tall and slim, 
with short whitish-blond hair 
around a thin-boned face.

He had hunted aliens on many 
planets. Now he had to track 
down the deadliest — himself!

Kiev Archad shrugged. He 
listened a moment. 

He translated: 

You desert me now, female 
Because I am crippled. 

And yet all my fault was 

That I did not lack courage. 

Therefore I will go now to the 
high rocks to die. 

And another will take you. 

For what good is a warrior 

Whose female forsakes him? 

Kief stopped translating. 

“Go on,” said Willy. The song 
was still mournfully falling upon 
them from the rocks above. 

“There isn’t any more,” said 
Kiev. “He just keeps singing it 
over and over again. He’ll go on 
singing until it’s time to seal his 
hole and keep the heat from dry- 
ing him up.” 

“Oh,” said Willy. “Is he really 
crippled, do you think?” 

Kiev shrugged again. 

“I doubt it,” he said. “If he 
were really hurt he’d be keeping 
quiet, so none of the other males 
could find him. As it is, he’s prob- 
ably just hoping to lure another 
one of them close — so that he can 
kill himself a full meal before the 
sun rises.” 

She gasped. 

He looked at her. “Sorry,” he 
said. “If you weren’t printed with 
the language, maybe you weren’t 
printed with the general info — ” 



“Like the fact they’re canni- 
bals? Of course I was,” she said. 
“It doesn’t disturb me at all. 
Cannibalism is perfectly reason- 
able in an environment like this 
where the only other protein 
available is rock rats — and every- 
thing else, except humans, is car- 
bohydrates.” 

She glanced at one of the sever- 
al moonplants growing like out- 
size mushrooms from the rocky 
rubble of the surface beside the 
shelter’s silver walls. They had al- 
ready pulled their petals into the 
protection of horny overhoods. 
But they had not yet retreated 
into the ground. 

“After all,” she said into his si- 
lence, “my field’s anthropropath- 
ic history. People who disturb 
easily just don’t take that up for a 
study. There were a number of 
protein-poor areas back on Earth 
and so-called primitive local peo- 
ple became practical cannibals 
out of necessity.” 

“Oh,” said Kiev. He wriggled 
his wide shoulders briefly against 
the short pre-dawn chill. “We’d 
better be getting inside and set- 
tled. You’ll need as much rest as 
you can get. We’ll have to strike 
the shelter so as to start our drive 
at sunset.” 

“Sunset?” She frowned. “It’ll 
still be terribly hot, won’t it? 
What drive?” 

He turned sharply to look at 
her.

IF 




“I thought — if you knew about 
their eating habits — ” 

“No,” she said, interested. “No 
one said anything to me about 
drives.” 

“We’ve been picking up a gang 
of them ever since we left the ho- 
tel,” he said. “And we’re protein, 
too, just as you say. Or at least, 
enough like their native protein 
for them to hope to eat us. Sooner 
or later, if there get to be enough 
of them, they’ll attack — if we don’t 
drive them first.” 

“Oh, I see. You scare them off 
before they can start something.” 
“Something like that — yes.” He 
turned, ran his finger down the 
closure of the shelter and threw 
back the flap. “That’s why Wadjik 
and Shant came this far with us — 
so we could have four men for the 
drive. “Come on, we’ve got to get 
inside.” 

She went past him into the shel- 
ter. 

I NSIDE, Johnson and the other 
prospecting team of Wadjik and 
Shant — who would split with them 
next evening — were already cozy. 
Johnson was hunched in his ther- 
mal sleeping bag, reading. Wadjik 
and Shant were at a card table 
playing bluet. Johnson turned his 
dark face to Kiev and Willy as 
they came in. 

He said, “I laid your bags out 
for you — beyond the stores.” 
“Regular nursemaid,” said 



Wadjik without looking up from 
his cards. 

“Wad,” said Johnson, quietly. 
“You and Shanny can shelter up 
separately if you want.” His bare 
arms and chest swelled with mus- 
cle above the partly open slit of 
his thermal bag. He was not as big 
as Wadjik or Kiev but he was the 
oldest and knew the mountains 
better than any of them. 

“Two more cards,” said Wadjik 
looking to Shant. 

The gray-headed man dealt. 

Kiev led the way around the 
card table. Two unrolled thermal 
bags occupied the floor space next 
to the entrance to the lavatory par- 
tition that gave privacy to the shel- 
ter’s built-in chemical toilet. Kiev 
gave the one nearest to the parti- 
tion to Willy and unrolled the oth- 
er next to the pile of stores. 

The pile was really not much as 
a shelter divider. By merely lifting 
himself on one elbow, once he was 
in his bag, Kiev was able to see the 
other three bags and Johnson, 
reading. The card players, sitting 
up at their table, could look down 
on both Kiev and Willy — but, of 
course, once it really started to 
heat up, they would be in their 
sacks too. 

Kiev undressed within his ther- 
mal bag, handing his clothes out 
as he took them off and keeping 
his back turned to the girl. When 
at last he turned to her he saw that, 
while she was also in her bag, she 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY

still wore a sort of light blouse or 
skivvy shirt— he had no idea what 
the proper name for it was. 

“That’s all right for now,” he 
said, nodding at the blouse. “But 
later on you’ll be wanting to get 
completely down into the bag for 
coolness, anyhow, so it won’t mat- 
ter for looks. And any kind of 
cloth between you and the bag’s 
inner surface cuts its efficiency 
almost in half.” 

“I don’t see why,” she answered 
stiffly. 

“They didn’t tell you that ei- 
ther?” he asked. “Part of the 
main idea behind using the ther- 
mal bag is that we don’t have to 
carry too heavy an air-condition- 
ing unit. If you take heat from 
anything, even a human body, 
you’ve got to pump it somewhere 
else. That’s what an air-condition- 
ing unit does. But these bags are 
stuffed between the walls with a 
chemical heat-absorbent — ” 

He went on, trying to explain to 
her that the bag could soak up the 
heat from her naked body over a 
fourteen-hour period without get- 
ting so full of heat it lost its cooling 
powers. But the lining of the bag 
was built to operate in direct con- 
tact with the human skin. Any- 
thing like cloth in between caused 
a build-up of stored heat that 
would overload the bag before the 
fourteen hours until cool-off was 
over. It was not just a matter of 
comfort — she would be risking 



heat prostration and even death. 

She listened stiffly. He did not 
know if he had convinced her or 
not. But he got the feeling that 
when the time finally came she 
would get rid of the garment. He 
lay back in his own bag, closed 
his eyes and tried to get some 
sleep. In another four hours sleep 
would be almost impossible even 
in the bags. 

Wadjik and Shant were fools 
with their cards. A man could 
tough out a drive with only a cou- 
ple of hours of sleep; but what if 
some accident during the next 
shelter stop kept him from get- 
ting any sleep at all? He could be 
half dead with heat and exhaus- 
tion by the following cool-off, his 
judgment gone and his reflexes 
shot. One little bit of bad luck 
could finish him off. Characters 
like Johnson had survived in the 
mountains all these years by al- 
ways keeping in shape. After four 
trips into the grounds Kiev had 
made up his mind to do the same 
thing. 

H E SLEPT. The heat woke 
him. 

He found he had instinctively 
slid down into his bag and sealed 
it up to the neck without coming 
fully awake. Opening his eyes 
now, feeling the blasting dryness 
and quivering heat of the air 
against his already parched face, 
he first pulled his head down com-

IF 




pletely into the bag and took a 
deep breath. The hot air from 
above, pulled momentarily into 
the bag, cooled on his dust-dry 
throat and mouth. He worked 
some saliva into existence, swal- 
lowed several times and then, sit- 
ting up, pushed his head and one 
arm out of the bag. He found his 
salve and began to grease his face 
and neck. 

He glanced over at Willy as he 
worked. She was lying muffled in 
her thermal bag, watching him, 
her features shining with salve. 

“You take that shirt off?” he 
asked. 

She nodded briefly. He looked 
over past the deserted card table 
at the three other thermal bags. 
Johnson, encased to his nose, 
slept with the ease of an old pros- 
pector, his upper face placidly 
shining with salve. Shant was out 
of sight in his bag — all but his 
close-cut cap of gray hair. Wadjik 
was propped up against a case 
from the stores, his heavy-boned 
face under its uncombed black 
hair absent-eyed, staring at and 
through Kiev. 

“Wad,” said Kiev, “better get 
Shanny up out of that. He’ll over- 
load his sack in five hours if he 
goes to sleep breathing down 
there like that.” 

Wadjik’s eyes focused. He 
grinned unpleasantly and rolled 
over on his side. He bent in the 
middle and kicked the foot of his 



thermal bag hard against the side 
of Shant’s. Shant’s head popped 
into sight. 

“You go to sleep down there,” 
Wad snarled, “and you won’t live 
until sunset.” 

“Oh — sure, Wad. Sorry,” 
Shant said, quickly 

A short silence fell. Wadjik had 
gone back to staring through un- 
focused eyes. Johnson woke but 
the only sign he gave was the rais- 
ing of his eyelids. He did not 
move in his bag. Around them all, 
now, the heat was becoming a 
living thing — an invisible but 
sentient presence, a demon in- 
side the shelter who could be felt 
growing stronger almost by the 
second. The shelter’s little air- 
conditioner hummed, keeping the 
air about them moving and just 
below unbreathable temperature. 

“Kiev,” said Wadjik, suddenly. 
“Was that old Hehog you and 
Willy were listening to out there, 
just before dawn?” 

“Yes,” said Keiv. 

“This time we’ll get him.” 
“Maybe,” said Kiev. 

“No maybe. I mean it, man.” 
“We’ll see,” said Kiev. 

A movement came beside Kiev. 
Willy sat up in her bag. 

“Mr. Wadjik— ” 

“Joe. I told you — Joe.” 

Wadjik grinned at her. 

“All right. Joe. Do you mean 
you knew which Udbahr male 
that was — the one who was sing- 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



9 




ing just before Kiev and I came 
in?” 

“Sure. Didn’t Kiev tell you?” 
Wadjik’s eyes shifted for a mo- 
ment to Kiev’s face. “That’s old 
Hehog you were listening to. He’s 
picked off a couple of men in his 
time. And we’ve had him in two 
drives — and lost him in both.” 

“Lost him?” 

“I mean, he got away.” Wadjik 
stared at her. “Don’t you know 
about drives, Willy? Didn’t Kiev 
tell you?” 

“He told me,” said Willy. But I 
don’t understand what you mean 
by got away. You couldn’t very 
well keep him prisoner, could you? 
Or do you do that for a while 
after a drive?” 

“Prisoner?” 

Wadjik stared at her. Suddenly 
he gave a short, throaty laugh. 

“Prisoner? Did Kiev tell you we 
kept them prisoners?” He jolted 
out another laugh. “Of course we 
don’t keep them prisoners. We 
kill them. That’s what a drive’s 
for — to kill off the ones with guts 
enough to lead an attack at us. 
Prisoners?” 

Willy stared at him. Slowly she 
turned her face to stare at Kiev. 
Greased-up and outraged, she 
made a picture more ridiculous 
than accusing but plainly she did 
not realize that. 

“Damn you, Wad,” said John- 
son calmly from his bag. “Shut 
up. You’re making trouble. 



W ILLY lay down, with- 
drawing into her bag and 
turning her face away from the 
rest of them. Kiev drew himself 
down to the nose in his own sack. 
Silence and increasing heat held 
the interior of the shelter. 

There was no talk for a couple 
of hours after Johnson’s words 
and Kiev fell into a sort of doze in 
spite of the heat. But with the in- 
creasing temperature even this be- 
came an impossibility — which was 
a good thing. A sleeping man 
could instinctively pull his head 
down into the coolness of the 
thermal bag and, by breathing in- 
side it, overload it in a few hours. 

Kiev came out of his semi-coma 
in the middle of a furious whis- 
pered argument going on across 
the ten feet of shelter space be- 
tween Wadjik and Willy. 

“. you’re all alike, you — ” 
Wadjik swore at her. “Call a 
monkey a man. Call him better 
than a man. It doesn’t matter to 
you that real men get killed by 
the monkeys. All that matters is 
— do the monkeys get killed. 
You—” 

“Shut up.” Willy did not use 
obscenity but she did not seem 
hampered by the lack of it in de- 
scribing Wadjik to himself. She 
went on ragingly while he was 
still talking in that instinctive, 
venomous whisper which was eas- 
iest on both their heatdried 
throats. “Don’t you know why 



10 



IF 




I’m going to these prospecting 
grounds of yours? Don’t you know 
about the remains of a city there 
built by these same Udbahrs?” 
“Sure, I’ve seen it. What of 
it?” 

“I’m telling you what of it! 
They had a high level of civiliza- 
tion once— or at least a higher 
level than now. But that doesn’t 
mean anything to you — ” 

“They degenerated. That’s 
what it means to me. They’re 
cannibal degenerates. And you 
want me to treat them like human 
beings — 

“I want you to treat them like 
intelligent beings — which they 
'are. Even an uneducated, brutal, 
stupid man like you ought to 
understand — ” 

“Listen to who’s talking. The 
kid historian speaks. I thought 
you were still in school, writing a 
thesis. You didn’t tell me you’d 
been at this for years — ” 

“I may be only a graduate 
student but I’ve learned ' a 
few things you never did — ” 

Looking past Wadjik’s heat- 
reddened face, flaming under its 
salve, Kiev saw the upper part of 
Johnson’s countenance beyond. 
Johnson seemed to be calmly 
listening. There was nothing to 
do, Kiev knew, but listen. It was 
the heat — the sickening intoxica- 
tion of the deadly heat in the shel- 
ter — that was making the argu- 
ment. When the heat reached its 



most relentless intensity only the 
instinct keeping men in their 
thermal bags stopped them from 
killing each other. 

Wadjik finally broke off the 
argument by drawing down into 
his bag and rolling across the 
floor of the* shelter to the lava- 
tory door. He pressed the bottom 
latch through his bag, opened 
the door, rolled inside and §hut 
himself off from the rest of the 
room. Willy fell silent. 

Kiev looked sideways at her. 

“It’s no use,” he whispered to 
her. “Save your energy.” 

She turned and glared at'him. 

“And I thought you were dif- 
ferent!” she spat and slid down, 
head and all, into her bag. 

Kiev backed into his own 
cocoon. Fueled by the feverish- 
ness induced by the heat, his 
mind ran on. They were all a 
little crazy, he thought, all who 
had taken up prospecting. 
Crazy — or they had something 
to hide in their pasts that would 
keep them from ever leaving 
this planet. 

But a man who was clean 
elsewhere could become rich in 
five years if he kept his head— 
and kept his health— both on the 
trips and back in civilization. On 
Kiev’s first trip into the moun- 
tains, two years ago, he had not 
known what he was after. Just 
a lot of money, he had thought, 
to blow back at the hotels. But 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



11 




now he knew better. He was 
going to take it cool and calm, 
like Johnson — who could never 
leave the planet. 

Kiev meant to keep his own 
backtrail clear. And he would 
leave when the time came with 
enough to buy higi citizenship 
and a good business franchise 
back on one of the Old Worlds. 
He had his picture of the future 
clear in his mind. A modern 
home on a settled world, a steady, 
good income. Status. A family. 

He had seen enough of the 
wild edges of civilization. Leave 
the rest of it to the new kids 
coming out. He was still young 
but he could look ahead and see 
thirty up there waiting for him. 

His thoughts rambled on 
through the deadly hours as his 
body temperature was driven 
slowly upward by the heat. In 
the end his mind rambled and 
staggered. He awoke suddenly. 

He had passed from near-delir- 
ium into sleep without realizing it. 
The deadly heat of mid-afternoon 
had broken toward cooloff and 
with the first few degrees of relief 
within the shelter he, like all the 
rest, had dropped immediately in- 
to exhausted slumber. By now — 
he glanced at the wristwatch on 
the left sleeve of his outergear— 
the hour was nearly sunset. 

He looked about the shelter. 
Willy, Shant, Wadjik, Johnson 
were still sleeping. 



“Hey,” he croaked at them, 
speaking above a whisper for the 
first time in hours. “Time for the 
drive. Up and at ’em.” 

I N FORTY-FIVE minutes they 
were all dressed, fed and out- 
side, with the shelter folded and 
packed, along with the other 
equipment, on grav-sleds ready 
to travel. Wadjik and Shant took 
off to the north, towing their own 
grav-sled. Kiev and Johnson were 
left with their sled and the girl. 
They looked at her thoughtfully. 
The sun was already down below 
the peaks to the west. But three- 
quarters of the sky above them 
was still white with a glare too* 
bright to look at directly and the 
heat, even with outersuit and hel- 
met sealed, made every move- 
ment a new cause for perspira- 
tion. The climate units of the 
suits whined with their effort to 
keep the occupants dry and cool. 

“I’m not going to join you,” 
Willy snapped. “I won't be a 
party to any killing of the na- 
tives.” 

“We can’t leave you behind,” 
Kiev answered. “Unless you can 
handle a gun — and will use it. If 
any of the males break away from 
the drive they’ll double back and 
you’d make an easy meal.” 

Inside the transparent helmet 
her face was pale even in the heat. 

“You can stick with the grav- 
sled,” said Kiev. “You don’t have 



12 



IF 




to join the drive. Just keep up.” 

She did not look at him or 
speak. She was not going to give 
him the satisfaction of an answer, 
he thought. 

“Move out, then,” said John- 
son. 

They began to climb the cliffs 
toward the brightness in the sky, 
the grav-sled trailing behind them 
on .slave circuit, its lo^d piled 
high. Willy, looking small in her 
suit, trudged behind it. Under the 
crown of the cliffs they turned 
about, deployed to cover both 
sides of the clearing below and 
began their drive. 

They worked forward, each 
man firing into every rock niche 
or cranny that might have an Ud- 
bahr sealed up within it. Deep, 
booming sounds — made by the 
air and moisture within each 
cranny exploding outward — be- 
gan to echo between the cliffs. 
Soon a shout came over Kiev’s 
suit intercom in Johnson’s deep 
voice. 

“One running! One running! 
Eleven o’clock, sixty meters, down 
in the cleft there.” 

Kiev jerked his gaze ahead and 
caught a glimpse of an adult- 
sized, humanlike, brown figure 
with a greenishly naked, round 
skull and large tarsierlike eyes, 
vanishing up a narrow cut. 

“No clothing,” called Kiev over 
the intercom. “Must be a female, 
or a young male.” 



“Or maybe old Hehog playing 
it incognito — ” Johnson began 
but was interrupted. 

“One running! One running!” 
bellowed Wadjik’s voice distantly 
over the intercom. “Two o’clock, 
near clifftop.” 

“One running! Deep in the pass 
there at three o’clock!” chimed in 
Johnson, again. “Keep them 
moving!” 

The sounds of the blasting at- 
tack now were routing out Ud- 
bahrs who had denned up for the 
ddy. Most were females or young, 
innocent of either clothing or wea- 
pons. But here and there was a 
heavier, male figure, running with 
spear or throwing-stick in hand 
and wearing anything from a 
rope of twisted rock vines or rat 
furs around his waist to some tat- 
tered article of clothing, stolen, 
scavenged — or just possibly taken 
as a war prize — from the dead 
body of a human prospector. 

The males were slowed by their 
insistence on herding the females 
and the young ahead of them. 
They always did this, even though 
nearly all prospectors made it a 
point to kill only the grown males 
— the warriors who were liable to 
attack if left alive. The pattern 
was old, familiar — one of the 
things that made most prospec- 
tors swear the Udbahrs had to be 
animal rather than intelligent. 
The females and young were gath- 
ering into a herd as they ran, 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



13 




joining up beyond the screen of 
the males following them. When 
the herd was complete — when all 
who should be in it had been ac- 
counted for — the males would 
choose their ground, stop and 
turn to fight and hold up the pur- 
suers while the females and young 
escaped. 

T HEY always reacted the 
same way, no matter whether 
the tactic were favorable or not in 
the terrain where they were being 
driven, Kiev thought suddenly. 
Everything the Udbahrs did was 
by rote. And strange to creatures 
who reasoned like men. No mat- 
ter what Willy said, it was hard to 
think of them as any kind of peo- 
ple — let alone people with whom 
you could become involved. For 
example, if he, Johnson, Shant 
and Wadjik quit driving the na- 
tives now and pulled back, the 
Udbahr males would immediately 
turn around and start trying to 
kill each other. It was only when 
they were being driven or were 
joining for an attack on prospec- 
tors that the males had ever been 
known to cooperate. 

So, as it always went, it went 
this sunset hour on the Udbah-r 
Planet. By the time the last light 
of the day star was beginning to 
evaporate from the western sky 
and the great ghostly circle of the 
nearer moon was beginning to be 
visible against a more reasonably 



lighted sky, some half dozen of 
the Udbahr males disappeared 
suddenly among the boulders 
and rocks at the mouth of a pass 
down which the herd of females 
and young were vanishing. 

“Hold up,” Johnson gasped 
over the intercom. “Hold it up. 
They’ve forted. Stop and 
breathe.” 

Kiev checked his weary legs 
and collapsed into sitting position 
on a boulder, panting. His body 
was damp all over in spite of the 
efforts of his suit to keep him dry. 
His head rang with a headache 
induced by exhaustion and the 
heat. 

The Udbahr males hidden 
among the rocks near the mouth 
of the pass began to sing their in- 
dividual songs of defiance. 

Kiev’s breathing eased. His 
headache receded to a dull ache 
and finally disappeared. The last 
of the daylight was all but gone 
from the sky behind them. The 
nearer moon, twice as large as the 
single moon of Earth by which all 
moons were measured, was sharp- 
ly outlined, bright in the sky, il- 
luminating the scene with a sort 
of continuing twilight. 

“What’re you waiting for?” 
Willy’s voice said dully in his ear- 
phones. “Why don’t you go and 
kill them?” 

He turned to look for her and 
was astonished to find her, with 
the grav-sled, almost beside him. 



14 



IF 




She had sat down on the ground, 
her back bowed as if in deep dis- 
couragement, her face turned 
away and hidden from him with- 
in the transparent helmet. 

“They’ll come to us,” he mut- 
tered without thinking. 

Suddenly she curled up com- 
pletely into a huddled ball of sil- 
ver outerwear suit and crystalline 
helmet. The sheer, unutterable 
anguish of her pose squeezed at 
his throat. 

He dropped down to his knees 
beside her and put his arms 
around her. She did not respond. 

“You don’t understand — ” he 
said. And then he had the sense 
to tongue off the interphone and 
speak to her directly and private- 
ly through the closeness of their 
helmets, alone. “You don’t un- 
derstand.” 

“I do understand. You like to 
do this. You like it.” 

Her voice was muffled, dead. 

His heart turned over at the 
sound of it and suddenly, unex- 
pectedly, he realized that^he had 
somehow managed to fall in love 
with her. He felt sick inside. It 
was all wrong — all messed up. He 
had meant to go looking for a 
woman — but eventually, after 
he’d made his stake and gone 
back to some civilized world. He 
had not planned anything like 
this involvement with a girl he 
had known only five days and 
who had all sorts of wild notions 



about how things should be. He 
did not know what to do except 
kneel there, holding her. 

“If you don’t like it why do you 
do it?” her voice said. “If you 
really don’t like it — then don’t do 
it. Now. Let these go.” 

“I can’t,” he said. 

The singing broke off sudden- 
ly in a concerted howl from the 
Udbahr males, mingled with a 
triumphant cry over the intercom 
from Wadjik. 

“Got one.” And then: “Look 
out. Stones.” 

Kiev jerked into the shelter of 
a boulder, dragging Willy with 
him. Two rocks, each about half 
the size of his fist, dug up the 
ground where they had crouched 
together. 

“You see?” 

He pushed her roughly from 
him and drew his sidearm. Lean- 
ing around the boulder, he 
searched the rocks of the slope 
below the pass, watching the ver- 
nier needle of the heat-indicator 
slide back and forth on the wea- 
pon’s barrel. It jumped suddenly 
and he stopped moving. 

He peered into the gun’s rear 
sights, thumbing the near lens to 
telescopic. He held his aim on the 
warm location, studying the small 
area framed in the sight screen. 
Suddenly he made it out^a tiny 
patch of brown between a larger 
boulder and a bit of upright, 
broken rock. 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



15 




He aimed carefully. 

“Don’t do it.” 

He jerked involuntarily, send- 
ing his beam wide of the mark at 
the sound of her voice. A patch of 
bare gravel boomed and flew. The 
bit of brown color disappeared 
from between the rocks. He 
leaned the front of his helmet 
wearily against the near side of 
the boulder before him. 

“Damn you,” he said helpless- 
ly. “What are you doing to me?” 

* “I’m trying to save you,” she 
said fiercely, “from being a mur- 
derer.” 

Another stone hit the top of the 
boulder behind which they hid 
and caromed off over their heads. 

“How about saving me from 
that?” he said emptily. “Don’t 
you understand? If we don’t kill 
them they’ll try to kill us — ” 

“I don’t believe it.” She, too, 
had shut off her intercom. Her 
voice came to him distantly 
through two thicknesses of trans- 
parent material. “Have you ever 
tried? Has anyone ever tried?” 

Another sudden volley of stones 
was followed by more dull explo- 
sions as the heat of the human 
weapons found and destroyed live 
targets. Shant and Wadjik were 
howling in triumph and shooting 
steadily. 

“We got five — they’re on the 
run.” Shant whooped. “Kiev! 
Johnson! They’re on the run.” 

The explosions ceased. Kiev 



peered cautiously around his 
boulder, stood up slowly. Wadjik, 
Shant, and Johnson had risen 
from positions in a semicircle fac- 
ing the distant pass. 

“Any get away?” Johnson was 
asking. 

“One, maybe two — ” Shant cut 
himself short. “Look out — duck. 
Twelve o’clock, fifty meters.” 

At once Kiev was again down 
behind his boulder. He dragged 
down Willy, tongued on his inter- 
com. 

“What is it?” 

“That chunk of feldspar about 
a meter high — ” 

K IEV looked down the slope 
until his eyes found the rock. 
A glint that came and went be- 
hind and above it, winking in the 
waxing light of the nearer moon 
that now seemed as bright as a 
dull, cloudy day back on Earth. 
The flash came and went, came 
and went. 

Kiev recognized it presently as 
a reflection from the top curve of 
a transparent helmet bobbing 
back and forth like the head of 
someone dancing just behind the 
boulder. A male Udbahr’s voice 
began to sing behind the rock. 

Man with a head-and-a-half, 
come and get your half-head. 
Man with a head-and-a-half 
Come so I can kill you. 
Ancient, my enemy. 

Ancient, my enemy — 



16 



IF 




“Hehog,” snapped Johnson’s 
voice over the helmet intercom. 

Silence held for a minute. Then 
Wadjik’s voice came thinly 
through the phones. 

“What are you waiting for, 
Kiev?” 

Kiev said nothing. The trans- 
parent curve of the helmet top, 
rose again, bobbed and danced 
behind the boulder. It danced 
higher. Within it now was a bald, 
round, greenish skull with red- 
dish, staring tarsier eyes and — 
finally revealed — the lipless gash 
of a fixedly grinning mouth. 

“What is it? What’s Wadjik 
mean?” Willy asked. 

Her voice rang loud in Kiev’s 
helmet phones. She had reacti- 
vated her intercom. 

“It’s Hehog down there,” Kiev 
said between stiff jaws. “That’s 
my helmet he’s wearing. He’s 
had it ever since he first took it 
off me, my first trip into the 
mountains.” 

“Took it off you?” 

“I was new . % I’d never been on a 
drive before,” muttered Kiev. “I 
got hit in the chest by a stone, 
had the wind knocked out of me. 
Next thing I knew Hehog was 
lifting off my helmet. My part- 
ners came up shooting and drove 
him off.” 

“What about it, Kiev?” The 
voice was Johnson’s. “Do you 
want us to spread out and get be- 
hind him? Or you want to go 



down and get the helmet by your- 
self'” 

Kiev grunted under his breath, 
took his sidearm into his left hand 
and flexed the cramped fingers of 
his right. They had been squeez- 
ing the gunbutt as if to mash it 
out of all recognizable shape. 

“I’m going alone,” he said over 
the intercom. “Stay back.” 

He got his heels under him and 
was ready to rise when he was 
unexpectedly yanked backward 
to the gravel. Willy had pulled 
him down. 

“You’re not going*” 

He tongued off his intercom, 
turned and jerked her hand loose 
from his suit. 

“You don’t understand,” he 
shouted at her through his hel- 
met. “That’s the trouble with you. 
You don’t understand a damn 
thing.” 

He pushed her from him, rose 
and dived for the protection of a 
boulder four meters down the 
slope in front of him and a cou- 
ple of meters to his right. 

A flicker of movement came 
from below as he moved — the up- 
ward leap of a throwing stick be- 
hind the rock where Hehog hid. 
Kiev glimpsed something dark 
racing through the air toward 
him. A rock fragment struck and 
burst on the boulder face, spray- 
ing him with stone chips and 
splinters. 

Reckless now, he threw himself 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



17 




toward the next bit of rocky cover 
farther down the slope. His foot 
caught on a stony outcropping in 
the shale. He tripped and rolled, 
tumbling helplessly to a stop be- 
side the very boulder behind 
which Hehog crouched, throwing 
stick in one hand, stone-tipped 
spear in the other. 

Kiev sprawled on his back. He 
stared helplessly up into the great 
eyes and humorlessly grinning 
mouth looming over him inside 
the other helmet less than an 
arm’s length away. The spear 
twitched in fhe brown hand — but 
that was all. 

Hehog stared into Kiev’s eyes. 
Kiev was aware of Willy and the 
others shouting through his hel- 
met phones. A couple of shots 
blasted grooves into the boulder- 
top above his head. And with a 
sudden, wordless cry Hehog 
bounded to his feet and dodged 
away among the boulders toward 
the pass. 

The bright beams of shots from 
the human guns followed him but 
lost him. He vanished into the 
pass. 

K IEV climbed to his feet, shak- 
ing inside. He awoke to the 
fact that he was still holding his 
sidearm. A bitter understanding 
broke upon him with the hard, 
unsparing clarity of an Udbahr 
Planet dawn. 

He could have shot Hehog at 



pointblank range during the mo- 
ment he had spent staring frozen- 
ly at the spear in Hehog’s hand 
and at the great-eyed, grinning 
head within the helmet. Hehog 
had to have seen the gun. And 
that would have been why he had 
not tried to throw the spear. 

Kiev cursed blackly. He was 
still cursing when the others slid 
down the loose rock of the slope 
to surround him. 

“What happened?’' demanded 
Shant. 

“He — ” Kiev discovered that 
his intercom was still off. He 
tongued it on. “He got away.” 

“We know he got away,” said 
Wadjik. “What we want to know 
is how come?” 

“You saw,” Kiev snapped. “1 
fell. He had me. You scared him 
off.” 

“He had you? I thought you 
had him , damn it!” 

“All right, he’s gone,” Johnson 
said. “That’s the main thing. 
Leave the other bodies for who- 
ever wants to eat them. We’ve 
had a good drive. We’ll split up, 
now.” He looked at Wadjik and 
Shant. “See you back in civiliza- 
tion.” 

Wadjik cursed cheerfully. 

“Team with the heaviest load 
buys the drinks,” he said. “Come 
on, Shanny.” 

The two of them turned away, 
dragging their loaded grav-sled 
through the air behind them. 



18 



IF 




K iev, willy and John- 
son reached Dead City a 
good two hours before dawn. 
They had time to pick out one of 
the empty, windowless houses, 
half-cave, half building, to use as 
permanent headquarters. Tomor- 
row night they would cut stone to 
fill the open doorway but for to- 
day the shelter, fitted double- 
thick into the opening, would do 
well enough. 

No singing came from the sur- 
rounding cliffs. Johnson crawled 
in. Kiev lingered to speak to 
Willy. 

“You don’t have to worry.” 
The words were not what he had 
planned to say. “The Udbahrs 
are scared of this place.” 

“I know.” She did not look at 
him. “Of course. I know more 
about this city and the Udbahrs 
than even Mr. Johnson does. 
There’s a taboo on this place for 
them.” 

“Yes.” Kiev looked down at 
his gloved right hand^and spread 
the fingers, still feeling the hard 
butt of his sidearm clamped in- 
side them. “About earlier tonight, 
with Hehog — ” 

“It’s all right,” she said softly, 
looking unexpectedly up at him. 
Her intercom was off and her 
voice came to him through her 
helmet. In the combination of the 
low-angled moonlight and the 
first horizon glow of the dawn, 
her face seemed luminescent. “I 



know you did it for me — after 
all.” 

He stared at her. 

“Did what?” 

She still spoke softly: “I know 
why you let that Udbahr male 
live. It was because of what I’d 
said, wasn’t it? But you need to 
be ashamed of nothing. You sim- 
ply haven’t gone bad inside, like 
the others. Don’t worry — I won’t 
tell anyone.” 

She took his arm gently with 
both hands and lifted her head as 
if — had they been unhelmeted — 
she might have kissed his cheek. 
Then she turned and disappeared 
into the cave. 

He followed her after some mo- 
ments. A small filter panel in the 
shelter had let a little of the ter- 
rible daylight through for illumi- 
nation. Here artificial lighting 
had to be on. Kiev saw by it that 
she had piled stores and opened 
some of her own gear to set up a 
four-foot wall that gave her in- 
dividual privacy. 

He laid out his own thermal 
bag. The heat was quite bearable 
behind the insulation of the thick- 
walled building as the day began. 
Kiev fell into a deep, exhausted 
sleep that seemed completely 
dreamless. 

He awoke without warning. In- 
stantly alert, he rose to an elbow. 

The light was turned down. He 
heard no sound from Willy. John- 
son snored. 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



19 




Kiev remained stiffly propped 
on one elbow. A feeling of danger 
prickled his skin. He found his 
ears were straining for some 
noise that did not belong here. 

He listened. 

For a long moment he heard 
only the snoring and beyond it 
silence. Then he heard what had 
awakened him. It came again, 
like the voice of some imprisoned 
spirit — not from beyond the wall 
but from under the stone floor 
on which he lay. 

Man with a head-and-a-half, 

come and get your half-head. 

Man with a head-and-a-half , 
Come , so I can kill you. 

Ancient, my enemy. 

Ancient, my enemy 

The singing broke off suddenly. 
Kiev jerked bolt upright and the 
thermal bag fell down around his 
waist. Suddenly more loudly 
through the rock, and nearer, the 
voice echoed in the dim interior of 
the stone building: 

Only for ourselves is the killing 
of each other! 

Man with a head-and-a-half, 

come and get your half-head. 

Man with a head-and-a-half . 

T HE singing continued. Fury 
uprushed like vomit in Kiev. 
He swore, tearing off his thermal 
bag and pawing through his piled 



outerwear. His fingers closed on 
the butt of the weapon. He jerked 
it clear, aimed it at the section of 
floor from which the singing was 
coming and pressed the trigger. 

Light, heat and thunder 
shredded the sleeping quiet of the 
dimly lit room. Kiev held the 
beam steady, a hotter rage inside 
him than he could express with 
the rock-rending gun. He felt his 
arm seized. The sidearm was torn 
from his grip. He whirled to find 
Johnson holding the weapon out 
of reach. 

“Give me that,’' Kiev said 
thickly. 

“Wake up," Johnson said, low- 
voiced. “What's got into you?" 

“Didn't you hear?" Kiev 
shouted at him. “That was Hehog 
— Hehog! Down there!" 

He pointed at the hole with its 
melted sides, half a meter deep 
into the floor of the building. 

“I heard," said Johnson. “It 
was Hehog, all right. There must 
be tunnels under some of these 
buildings." 

Willy chimed in. 

“But Udbahrs don’t — " 

Kiev and Johnson turned to see 
her staring at them over the top 
of her barricade. Kiev became 
suddenly conscious that, like John- 
son, he was completely without 
clothes. 

Willy’s face disappeared abrupt- 
ly. Kiev turned back to look at the 
hole his gun had burned in the 



20 



IF 




stone. It showed no breakthrough 
into further darkness at the bot- 
tom. 

“All right,” he said shakily. 
“I’m sorry. I woke up hearing 
him and just jumped — that’s all. 
We can shift to another building 
tomorrow. And sound for tunnels 
before we move in.” 

Johnson turned and returned 
to his thermal bag. Kiev resumed 
his cocoon. He lay on his back, 
hands behind his head, staring up 
at the shadowy ceiling. 

. Ancient, my enemy . an- 
cient, my enemy . 

The memory of Hehog’s chant 
continued to run through his 
head. 

You and me, Hehog. I’ll show 
you, Udbahr . 

After some time he fell asleep. 

T HEY moved camp the next 
night, as soon as the sun was 
down. Kiev and Johnson quarried 
large chunks of rock from the wall 
of an adjoining building, melted 
them into place to fill up the new 
door opening, except for the en- 
trance unit, which was set up 
double as a heat lock and fitted 
into place. 

Now the shelter air-conditioner 
could keep the whole interior of 
the new building comfortable all 
day long. The night was half over 
by the time they finished. 

Kiev and Johnson had some 
four hours left to trek to their 



prospecting area. The gold ore 
deposits in the neighborhood of 
Dead City were almost always in 
pipes and easily worked out in a 
few days by men with the proper 
equipment. 

Kiev hesitated. 

“I’ll stay,” he said. “With He- 
hog around, someone’s got to stay 
with Miss Fairchild.” 

Johnson regarded him thought- 
fully. 

“You’re right. If we leave her 
here alone Hehog’s sure to get 
her. And who would sell us gear 
for our next trip if word got out 
about how we left her to be 
killed?” He hesitated. “Tell you 
what — we’ll draw straws.” 

Kiev said, “I’ll stay. Drop back 
in a week. I’ll tell you then if I 
need you to take over.” 

Johnson nodded. He turned 
away and began his packing — 
food, weapons, equipment, a wa- 
ter drill for tapping the moon 
flower root systems. Also, a 
breathing membrane for sealing 
the caves they would be denning 
up in by day. Kiev, squatting, 
making a final check of the seal 
around the entrance, saw a shad- 
ow fall across a seam he was ex- 
amining. 

He stood up, turned and saw 
Willy down the street, taking 
solidographs of one of the build- 
ings. Johnson stood just behind 
him, equipment already on his 
backpack. 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



21 




“We haven’t had a chance to 
talk,” Johnson said. 

“No.” 

“Let me say now what I’ve 
wanted to say. Why don’t you 
pack up and go back — and take 
the girl with you?” 

“I’ve got my stake to make out 
here — like everybody else.” 

“You know there’s more to the 
situation. Hehog’s changed every- 
thing. Also, there’s the girl— we 
both know what I mean. And 
there’s something else — some- 
thing I don’t think you’re aware 
of.” 

“What?” 

“You’ve heard how sometimes 
the males — if they’ve just fed so 
they aren’t hungry and there’s 
only one of them around — will 
come into your camp and sit down 
to talk?” 

Kiev frowned at him. 

“I’ve heard of it,” he said. “It’s 
never happened to me.” 

“It’s happened to me,” said 
Johnson. “They .ask you things 
that’d surprise you. Surprise you 
what they tell you, too. You know 
why Hehog’s broken taboo and 
come right into Dead City?” 

“Do you?” 

Johnson nodded. 

“There’s a thing the Udbahrs 
believe in,” Johnson said. “They 
figure that when they eat some- 
one they eat his soul, too?” 

“Sure,” said Kiev. “And that 
soul stays inside them until they’re 



killed. Then, when they die, if no 
one else eats them right away, all 
the souls of all the bodies they’ve 
eaten in their lives fly loose and 
take over the bodies of pups too 
young to have strong souls of their 
own.” 

Johnson nodded. He tilted his 
head at the distant figure of Willy. 

“You’ve been learning from 
her,” he said. 

“Her? As a matter of fact, I 
have,” said Kiev. “But you were 
the one told me about Udbahr 
cannibalism — a year or more 
ago.” 

“Did I?” Johnson looked at 
him. “Did I tell you about An- 
cient Enemies?” 

Kiev shook his head. 

“Once in a while a couple of 
males get a real feud going. It’s 
not an ordinary hate. It’s almost 
a noble thing — if you follow me. 
And from then on the feud never 
stops, no matter how many times 
they both die. Every time one is 
killed and born again — when he 
grows up it’s his turn to kill the 
other one. The next time the 
roles are reversed. You follow 
me?” 

Kiev frowned. 

“No.” 

“Figure both souls live forever 
through any number of bodies. 
They take turns killing each 
other physically.” Johnson looked 
strangely at Kiev. “The only thing 
is that no soul ever remembers 



22 



IF 




from one body to the next — they 
never know whose turn it is to be 
killed and which one’s to be the 
killer. So they just keep running 
into each other until the soul of 
one of them tells him, ‘Go!’ Then 
he kills the other and goes off to 
wait to die.” 

Johnson stopped speaking. Kiev 
stared. 

“You mean Hehog thinks he 
and I — he thinks we’re these An- 
cient Enemies?” 

“Night before last,” said John- 
son, ‘‘you and he were face to 
face, both armed — and neither 
one of you killed the other. Yes- 
terday — while we were denned 
up — he showed up here in the 
Dead City where it’s taboo for 
him to be. Being Ancient Enemies 
is the only thing that’d set him 
free of a taboo like that. What do 
you think?” 

Kiev turned for a second look 
down the street at Willy. 

“Hehog’s not going to leave you 
alone if I’m right,” said Johnson. 
“And he’s smart. He might even 
get away with killing one or two 
of us so he could stay close to you. 
And the easiest one for him to kill 
would be that girl. And it’s true 
what I said. We lose a human 
woman out here and no supplier’s 
going to touch us with a ten-foot 
pole.” 

‘‘Yeah,” said Kiev. 

“I’m not afraid of Hehog, my- 
self. But I’ve got no place else to 



go. I plan to die out here some 
day — but not yet for a few trips. 
Take the girl and head back. Give 
up the mountains while you still 
can. Kiev — I mean it.” 

“You can’t make us leave,” 
Kiev said slowly. 

“No,” said Johnson. His face 
looked old and dark as weather- 
stained oak. “But you keep that 
girl here and Hehog’ll get her. 
She doesn’t know anything but 
books and she doesn’t understand 
someone like Hehog. She doesn’t 
even understand us.” He took a 
step back. “So long, partner,” he 
said. “See you in three nights — 
maybe.” 

He turned and walked away 
slowly, leaning forward against 
the weight of the pack, until he 
was lost among the rocks of the 
western cliffs. 

Kiev turned and saw the small 
shape of Willy even farther down 
the street, still taking pictures. 

H E CONTINUED to think for 
the next two days and nights, 
which were quiet. He spent most 
of his time studying the aerial 
maps of areas near Dead City ■he 
had planned to work during this 
trip. Actually he was getting his 
ideas in order for explanation to 
Willy, who seemed to be having 
the time of her life. She was 
measuring and photographing 
Dead City inch by inch, as ex- 
cited over it as if it were one 
large Christmas present. She had 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



23 




changed toward him, too, teasing 
him and doing for him, by turns. 

Hehog did not sing from un- 
derground in the new building. 

On the third night Kiev invited 
himself along on her work with 
the City. 

He realized now that what 
Johnson had told him was true. 
Johnson’s words had been the 
final shove he had needed to make 
up his mind. The fact that he and 
Willy had met less than a week 
ago meant nothing. Out here 
things were different. 

He had worried about how he 
would bring up the subject of his 
future— and hers. But it turned 
out that he had no need to bring 
it up. It was already there. Al- 
most before he knew it they were 
talking as if certain things were 
understood and taken for granted. 

He said, “I’ve got at least five 
more trips to make to get the 
stake I need for a move back to 
the Old Worlds. You’d have to 
wait.” 

“But you don’t need to keep 
coming back here,” she said. “I 
know how you can make the rest 
of the money you need without 
even one more trip. I know be- 
cause a publishing company talked 
to me about doing something like 
it. There’s a steady market for in- 
formation about humanoids like 
the Udbahrs. Books, lectures. 
Acting as industrial and economic 
consultant — ” 




He stared at her. 

“I couldn’t do anything like 
that,” he said. “I’m no good with 
words and theories — ” 

“You don’t have to be. All you 
have to do is tell what you’ve 
seen and done on these trips of 
yours. You’ll collect enough on 
advance bookings alone for us to 
go back to any Old World you 



24 



IF 




want -after I get my doctorate, 
of course- and settle down there. 
Don't forget I've got my work, 
too. I'll be teaching.” She stared 
at him eagerly. “And think of 
what you’ll be achieving. Intelli- 
gent natives are being killed off 
or exploited on new worlds like 
this one simply because there’s no 
local concern over them and be- 



cause our civilization hasn’t un- 
derstood them enough to make 
the necessary concessions for 
them to accept it. You could be 
the one to get the ball rolling 
that could save the Udbahrs from 
being hunted down and killed 
off—” 

“By people like me, you 
mean,” he said, a little sourly. , 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



25 




“Not you. You haven’t yet 
been infected with the sort of 
killing lust Wadjik and Shant — 
and even Johnson — have.” 

“It isn’t a lust. Out here you 
have to kill the Udbahrs to keep 
them from killing you.” 

She looked at him sharply. 

“Yes — if you’re a savage,” she 
said. “As the Udbahrs are savages. 
I couldn’t love an Udbahr. I 
could only love a man who was 
civilized — able to keep the savage 
part inside him chained up. That 
Ancient Enemy business Hehog 
sang at you— that’s the way a 
savage thinks. I don’t expect you 
not to have the psychological 
capacity to lust for killing — but 
if you’re a healthy-minded man 
you can keep that sort of Ancient 
Enemy locked up inside you. You 
don’t have to let him take you 
over.” 

He opened his mouth to make 
one more stubborn effort to ex- 
plain himself to her, then closed 
it again rather helplessly. He 
found a certain uncomfortable 
rightness in part of what she was 
saying. Although from that right- 
ness she went off into left field 
somewhere to an area where he 
was sure she was wrong. While he 
groped for words to express him- 
self the still air around him was 
suddenly torn by the sound of a 
gun-bolt explosion. 

He found himself running to- 
ward the building they had set up 



as their headquarters, sidearm in 
his hand, the sound of Willy’s 
voice and footsteps following him. 
The distance was not great and he 
did not slow down for her. Better 
if he made it first — or if she did 
not come at all until he knew 
what had happened. 

He rounded the corner of the 
building and saw the shelter en- 
trance hanging in blackened tat- 
ters. He dove past it. By some 
miracle the light was still burning 
against the ceiling but the interior 
it illuminated was a scene of 
wreckage. Concussion and heat 
from the bolt had tom apart or 
scorched everything in the place. 

With a wild coldness inside 
him, he pawed swiftly through the 
rubble for whatever was usable. 
Two thermal sleeping bags were 
still in working condition, though 
their outer covering was charred 
in spots and stinking of burned 
plastic. Food containers were 
ripped open and their contents 
destroyed. The water drill was 
workable and most of one air 
membrane was untouched. 

“What happened? Who did it? 
Kiev—” 

H E AWOKE to the fact that 
Willy was with him again, 
literally pulling at him to get his 
attention. He came erect wearily. 

“I don’t know,” he said, dully. 
“Maybe some prospector has gone 
out of his head entirely. Or—” 



26 



IF 




He hesitated. 

“Or what?” 

He looked at her. 

“Or an Udbahr male has gotten 
hold of the gun of a dead prospec- 
tor.” 

Her face thinned and whitened 
under the light of the overhead 
temp. 

“A dead — ” 

She did hot finish. 

“That’s right,” he said. “One 
of our people, it could be — Wad- 
jik, Shant or Johnson.” 

“How could a savage who 
knows only sticks and stones kill 
an experienced, armed man?” 

Willy sounded outraged. 

“All sorts of animals kill peo- 
ple.” He felt sick inside, hating 
himself for not having set up at 
least a trigger wire to guard the 
building area. “We’ve got to get 
out of here. We can’t spend an- 
other night in a building, anyway, 
without a shelter entrance.” 
“Where’ll we go?” 

“We’ll head toward Johnson,” 
Kiev said. “He isn’t digging so far 
away that we shouldn’t be able to 
make it before dawn — if he isn’t 
dead.” 

They started out on the bearing 
Johnson had taken and soon left 
the city behind them. Fully risen 
moonflowers — some of them 
giants over three meters high — 
surrounded them. They were lost 
in a forest of strange, pale beauty, 
where by day there would only 



be the bare, heat-blasted moun- 
tainside. 

“Aren’t we likely to pass him 
and not even see him?” asked 
Willy. 

“No,” Kiev said absently. 
“He’ll be following contours at a 
constant elevation. So are we. 
When he gets close enough, we’ll 
hear static in our earphones.” 

He did not again mention the 
possibility of Johnson’s being 
dead — partly because he wanted 
to be easy on himself. 

They tramped on in silence. 
Kiev’s mind was busy among the 
number of problems opened up 
by their present situation. After 
about an hour he heard the hiss of 
interference in his helmet phones 
that signaled the approach of an- 
other transmitting unit. 

He stopped so suddenly that 
Willy bumped into him. He ro- 
tated his helmet slowly, listening 
for the maximum noise. When he 
found it, he spoke. 

“Johnson? Johnson, can you 
hear me?” 

“Thought it was you, Kiev.” 
Johnson’s voice came distorted 
and weakened by rocky distance. 
“The girl with you? What’s up?” 

“Somebody fired a gun into our 
building,” said Kiev. “I scraped 
together a sort of maintenance kit 
out of what was left — but I’m 
carrying all the salvage.” 

“I see.” Johnson did not waste 
breath on speculation. “Stop 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



27 




where you are and wait for me. 
We better head back toward 
Wad’s and Shanny’s diggings as 
soon as we’re together. No point 
your burning energy trying to 
meet me halfway.” 

“Right.” 

Kiev loosened his pack and sat 
down with his back to the trunk 
of a moonflower. Willy sat beside 
him. She said nothing and, busy 
with his own thoughts still, he 
hardly noticed her silence. 

By the time Johnson found 
them Kiev had already worked 
out the new compass heading 
from their present location to the 
diggings where Wadjik and Shant 
had planned to work. A little over 
three hours of the night remained. 

“Do you think we can make it 
before dawn?” Kiev asked as the 
three of them started out on the 
new heading. “You’ve been 
through that area before, haven’t 
you?” 

Johnson nodded. 

“I don’t know,” he said. “It’ll 
be faster going once the moon- 
flowers are down.” He looked at 
Willy. “We’ll be pushing on as 
fast as we can. Think you can 
keep up?” 

“Yes,” she said without looking 
at him. Her voice was dull. 

“Good. If you start really to 
give out, though, speak up. Don't 
overdo it to the point where we 
have to carry you. All right?” 

“Yes.” 



T HEY continued their march. 

Soon the moonflowers had 
drawn in their petals until they 
were hardly visible under the 
hoods and begun their retreat in- 
to the ground. The men were now 
able to see, across the tops of the 
hoods, the general shape of the 
terrain and pick the most direct 
route from contour point to con- 
tour point. Willy walked between 
them. The moonflower hoods still 
stood above her head — tall as she 
was for a woman — but did not 
seem to bother her. She looked at 
nothing. 

Johnson glanced at Kiev across 
the top of her helmet, and 
tongued off his helmet phones. 
He let her walk slightly ahead, 
then leai.ed toward Kiev until 
their helmets touched. 

“I told you,” Johnson said soft- 
ly through the helmet contact. 
“She didn’t understand or be- 
lieve. We were something out of 
books to her — so were the Ud- 
bahrs. Now she’s trying hard to 
keep on not believing. You see 
why I told you yesterday to get 
her out of here?” 

Kiev said nothing. 

Johnson pulled back his hel- 
met, tongued his intercom back 
on, kept walking. 

After a while the sky began to 
whiten ominously. The nearer 
moon was low and paling on the 
horizon behind. Johnson halted. 
Kiev and Willy also stopped. 



28 



IF 




“It’s no good,” said Johnson, 
over the intercom to Kiev. “We’re 
’going to have to take time to find 
a hole to crawl into before day. 
We’re going to have to quit now 
and wait for night.” 

Kiev nodded. 

“A hole?” echoed Willy. 

Kiev looked at Johnson. John- 
son shrugged. The message of the 
shrug was clear — there were no 
caves in this area. But they 
hunted until Johnson called a 
halt. 

“This will have to do.” 

He pointed to a crack in a rock 
face. He and Kiev attacked the 
crack with mining tools and their 
guns. 

Twenty minutes’ work hol- 
lowed out a burrow three meters 
in circular diameter, with an en- 
trance two feet square. Above the 
entrance the crack had been 
sealed with melted rock. The trio 
crawled inside and fitted the 
breathing membrane in place 
against the opening. 

Kiev waited until all were un- 
dressed and in their thermal bags 
before setting the light he had 
saved from the building in place 
against the roCky ceiling. The 
cramped closeness of their enclo- 
sure came to solid life around 
them. The den was beginning to 
heat up. 

The place had no air-condition- 
ing unit — the shelter had been a 
palace by comparison. Even Kiev 



had to struggle against the in- 
toxicating effect of the heat and 
the claustrophic panic of the en- 
closed space. Willy went out of 
her head before noon. Kiev and 
Johnson had to hold her in her 
thermal bag. Shortly after that 
she went into syncope and stayed 
unconscious until cool-off. 

Haggard with exhaustion, Kiev 
leaned on one elbow above her, 
staring down into her face, now 
smoothed out into natural sleep. 
Teetering on the verge of irresist- 
ible unconsciousness himself, he 
felt in him the strange clearhead- 
edness of utter weariness. She 
had been right, he thought, about 
that primitive part in him and all 
men — the Ancient Enemy. The 
prospectors did not so much fight 
the Udbahr males out here as 
something in themselves that cor- 
responded to its equivalent in the 
Udbahrs. The lust for killing. A 
lust that could get you to the 
point where you no longer cared 
if you were killed yourself. 

K IEV never finished the 
thought. When he opened 
his eyes the membrane was down 
from the entrance and outside was 
the cool and blessed moonlight. 

He crawled out to find Willy 
and Johnson already packing 
gear. 

“Got to move, Kiev,’’ said 
Johnson, seeing him. “If Wad 
and Shanny are alive and headed 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



29 




home we want to take out after 
them as soon as possible. One 
long night’s walk can put us back 
at the hotel.” 

“The hell you say.” Kiev was 
astonished. “They didn’t come all 
the way out with us and then cut 
that far back to find a digging 
area.” 

“No,” Johnson said, “but from 
here we can hit a different pass 
through the border range. Going 
back that way makes the hypot- 
enuse of a right triangle. Coming 
out we would have dog-legged it 
to reach this point like doing the 
triangle’s other two sides. You 
understand?” 

Within half an hour they were 
on their way. And within an hour, 
as they were coming around a 
high spire of rock, Johnson put 
out his arm and stopped. 

“Wait here, Willy,” Johnson 
said. “Come on, Kiev.” 

The two men rounded the rock 
and stopped, staring down into a 
small open area. They saw the 
scattered remains of working 
equipment and of Wadjik and 
Shant. At least one day under the 
open sun had mummified their 
bodies. Wadjik lay on his back 
with the broken shaft of a spear 
through his chest. But Shant had 
been pegged out and left to die. 

Their outerwear and guns were 
gone. 

“I thought I saw sign of at least 
half a dozen males back there,” 



Johnson said. “Hehog, all right — 
with help. He must be swinging 
some real clout with the other 
males to have kept them from eat- 
ing these two right away.” He 
glanced hard at Kiev. “And all 
for you.” 

Kiev stared. 

“Me? You mean Hehog tied 
Shanny up and left him like that 
on purpose — just so I could come 
along and see it?” 

“You begin to see what Ancient 
Enemy means?” he responded. 
“We’re in trouble, Kiev. Two 
guns missing and one of the local 
males grown into a real hoodoo. 
We’ll get moving for civilization 
right now.” 

“You’re going to bury them 
first,” Willy said. 

The men swung around. She 
was standing just behind them, 
looking at them. Her gaze drop- 
ped, fixed on the bodies below. 
For a second Kiev thought that 
the sight had sent her completely 
out of her mind. Then he saw that 
her eyes were clear and sane. 

Johnson said, “We haven’t 
time — and, anyway, the Udbahrs 
would come back to dig them up 
again when they were hungry 
enough.” 

“He’s right, Willy,” said Kiev. 
“We’ve got to go — fast.” He 
thought of something else and 
swung back to Johnson. “That 
pass you talked about — they’ll 
be laying for us there, Hehog and 



30 



IF 




the other males he’s got together. 
It’s the straightest route home, 
you say, and they know prospec- 
tors always head straight out of 
the mountains when they get into 
trouble.” 

Johnson shook his head. 

“Don’t think so,” he said. 
“You’re no prospector to Hehog. 
You’re his Ancient Enemy, look- 
ing for that one spot where you 
and he come face to face and one 
of you gets the word to kill the 
other. He’ll be right around this 
area, waiting for us to start hunt- 
ing for him. If we move fast we’ve 
got as good a chance as anyone 
ever had to get out of these moun- 
tains alive.” 

J OHNSON set a hard pace. 

Several times — before the 
nearer moon was high in the sky 
and the moonflowers were stretch- 
ing to full bloom — Willy tripped 
and would have gone down if 
Kiev had not caught her. But she 
did not complain. In fact, she 
said nothing at all. Shortly after 
midnight, they broke out from 
under the umbrellas of a clump 
of moonflower petals and found 
themselves in the pass Johnson 
had talked about. 

“We made it,” said Johnson, 
stopping. Kiev also stopped. 
Willy, stumbling with weari- 
ness, blundered into him. She 
clung to him like a child — and 
at that moment a thin, bright 



beam came from among the 
trunks of the moonflowers be- 
hind them. 

The side of Johnson’s outer- 
wear burst in dazzle and smoke. 

Johnson lunged forward. Kiev 
and Willy ran behind him. Three 
more bright beams flickered 
around them as they lurched over 
the lip of the pass, took half a 
dozen long, staggering, tripping 
strides down the far side and 
dived to shelter behind some 
waist-high chunks of granite. 

Male Udbahr voices began to 
sing on the far side of the pass. 

Johnson coughed. Kiev looked 
at him and Johnson quickly turn- 
ed his helmet away, so that the 
face plate was hidden. 

“Move out,” Johnson said, in a 
thick voice, like that of a man 
with a frog in his throat. 

“Are you crazy?” 

Kiev had his sidearm out. He 
sighted around the granite boul- 
der before him and sent a beam 
high into the rock wall beyond 
the lip of the pass, on the other 
side. The rock boomed loudly and 
flew in fragments. The singing 
stopped. After a moment it 
started again. 

“I can’t help you now,” John- 
son said, still keeping his face 
turned away. “Move out, I tell 
you.” 

“You think I’m going to leave 
you?” 

Kiev sent off another bolt into 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



31 




the rock face beyond the lip of the 
pass. This time the singing hardly 
paused. 

“Don’t waste your charges,” 
Johnson said hoarsely. “Get out. 
Half an hour puts you — hotel.” 

He had to stop in mid-sentence 
to cough. 

“Forget it, partner,” said Kiev. 
“With my gun and yours I can 
hold that pass until morning. 
They can’t come through.” 

Johnson gave an ugly laugh. 

“What partner?” he asked. 

“This partnership’s dissolved. 
And what’ll you do when dawn 
comes? Cook? You’re still a good 
hour’s trek from the hotel.” 

Kiev became aware that Willy 
was tugging at his arm. She mo- 
tioned with her head for him to 
follow her. He did. She slid back 
down among the rocks until they 
were a good four meters from 
where Johnson lay, head toward 
the pass. 

Willy tongued off her intercom 
and touched her helmet to his. 

“He’s dying,” she said to him 
through the helmets. 

“All right.” 

Kiev stared at her as if she were 
Hehog himself. 

“You couldn’t get him to the 
hotel in time to save his life even 
if there weren’t any Udbahrs be- 
hind us. And we’ll never make the 
hotel unless he stays there and 
keeps them from following us.” 

“So?” 



She took hold of his shoulders 
and tried to shake him but \\e was 
too heavy and too unmoving with 
purpose. 

“Be sensible.” She was almost 
crying. “Don’t you see it’s some- 
thing he wants to do? He wants 
to save us — ” 

Kiev stared at her stonily. 
“Shanny’s dead,” Kiev said. 
“Wad’s dead. You want me to 
leave Johnson?” 

S HE did begin to cry at that, 
the tears running down her 
pale face inside her helmet. 

“All right, hate me,” she said. 
“Why shouldn’t I want to live? 
This is all your fault — not mine. 
I didn’t kill your partners. I didn’t 
make Hehog your special enemy. 
All I did was love you. If you were 
back there I wouldn’t leave you, 
either. But that wouldn’t make 
my staying sensible.” 

“Go on if you want,” he said 
coldly. 

“You know I can’t find the 
hotel by myself!” she said. “You 
know I’m not going to leave you. 
Maybe you’ve got a right to kill 
yourself — maybe you’ve even got 
a right to kill me. But have you 
got the right to kill me for some- 
thing that’s got nothing to do with 
me?” 

He closed his eyes against the 
sight of her face. After seconds he 
opened his eyes, looked away 
from her, and* began to crawl

bafyc up the slope until he once 
more lay beside Johnson. 

“It’s Willy,” he said, not look- 
ing & the other man. 

“Sure. That’s right,” said John- 
son hoarsely. 

A flicker of dark movement 
came from one side of the pass and 
his gun spat. The pass was clear 
of pursuers again. 

“Damn you both,” Kiev said, 
emptily. 

“Sure, boy,” said Johnson. 
“Don’t waste time, huh?” 

Kiev lay where he was. The near- 
er moon was descending in the 
sky a little above and to the right 
of the pass. 

“I’ll leave my gun,” Kiev said 
at last. 

“Don’t need it,” Johnson said. 

Kiev reached out and took John- 
son’s gloved hand into his own. 
Through the fabric the return pres- 
sure of the other man’s grip was 
light and feeble. 

“Get out,” said Johnson. “I 
told you I figured on ending out 
here.” 

“You told me not for some trips 
yet.” 

“Changed my mind.” John- 
son let go of Kiev’s hand and 
closed his eyes. His voice was not 
much more than a whisper. “I 
think instead I’ll make it this 
trip.” 

He did not say any more. After 
a long minute Kiev spoke to him 
again. 



“Johnson — ” 

Johnson did not answer. Only 
the gun in his hand spat light 
briefly into the wall of the pass. 
Kiev stared a second longer, then 
turned and went sliding down the 
hill to where Willy crouched. 

“We go fast,” said Kiev. 

T HEY went away without look- 
ing back. Twice they heard the 
sound of a gun behind them. 
Then intervening rocks cut off 
whatever else they might have 
heard. They walked without paus- 
ing. After about an hour Willy 
began to stumble with exhaustion 
and clung to him. Kiev put his 
arm around her; they hobbled 
along together, leaning into the 
pitch of the upslopes, sliding in 
the loose rock of downslopes. 

The moon was low on the stony 
horizon behind them. Ahead came 
the first whitening in the sky that 
said dawn was less than two hours 
away. Willy staggered and leaned 
more heavily upon Kiev. Looking 
down at her face through the dou- 
ble transparencies of both helmets, 
Kiev saw that she was stumbling 
along with her eyes tightly closed, 
her face hardened into a color- 
less mask of effort. A strand of 
hair had fallen forward over one 
closed eye and his heart lurched 
at the sight of it. 

Not from the first had he ever 
thought of her as beautiful. Now, 
gaunt with effort, hair disarrayed,

she was less so than ever — and yet 
he had never loved and wanted 
her more. It was because of the 
mountains, he thought. And He- 
hog, Wad, Shanny — and John- 
son. Each time he had paid out 
one of them for her, the worth of 
her had gone up that much. Now 
she was equal to the total of all of 
them together. 

She stumbled again, almost lost 
her footing. A wordless little sound 
was jolted out from between her 
clenched teeth, though her eyes 
stayed closed. 

“Walk,” he said savagely, jerk- 
ing her upright and onward. 
“Keep walking.” They were on 
the Track, now, the curving trail 
that all the prospectors took out 
of the valley of the Border Hotel. 
“Keep walking,” he muttered to 
her. “Just around the curve 
there — ” 

A bolt from a gun behind them 
boomed suddenly against the cliff- 
base to their right. Rock chips 
rained down Willy’s knees. She 
lurched toward the shelter of the 
nearest boulder. 

He jerked her upright. 

“Run for it. Run — ” 

Jolting, stumbling, they ran 
while bolts from the gun boomed. 

“They can’t shoot worth — ” 
Kiev muttered through his teeth. 

He stopped talking. Because at 
that moment they rounded curve 
and saw the sprawling concrete 
shape of the Border Hotel and its 



grounds — and saw Hehog, hold- 
ing a sidearm, stepping out from 
behind a rock twenty feet ahead. 

In that instant time itself 
seemed to hesitate. Kiev’s weary 
legs had checked at his sight of 
Hehog. He started forward again 
at a walk, half-carrying Willy. 
Her eyes were still closed. 

He thought, She doesn't see 
Hehog. 

He marched on. Hehog brought 
up the gun, aimed it — but he, too, 
seemed caught in the suspension 
of time. He wore the helmet he 
had taken from Kiev two years 
before and now he also wore the 
white jacket of Shant’s outerwear 
suit — which almost fit him. He 
stood waiting, one sidearm in a 
jacket pocket, one in his hand, 
aimed. 

Kiev stumped toward him, 
bringing Willy. Kiev’s eyes were on 
the bulging eyes of Hehog. Their 
gazes locked. The only sound was 
the noise of Kiev’s boots scuf- 
fing the rock underfoot. From the 
hotel in the valley below, no sound. 
From the other Udbahr males that 
had been firing at them from be- 
hind, no sound. 

Kiev marched on, Hehog grow- 
ing before him. The great eyes 
danced in Kiev’s vision. There 
was a wild emptiness in Kiev now, 
an insane certainty. He did not 
move aside to avoid Hehog. They 
were ten feet apart — they were 
five — they would collide —

IF 




Hehog stepped back. Without 
shifting the line of his advance an 
inch, without moving his eyes to 
follow Hehog, Kiev marched past 
him. The trail to the hotel sloped 
suddenly more sharply under 
Kiev’s feet and now he looked only 
at what was manmade. All the 
Udbahrs were behind him. And 
behind him he heard Hehog be- 
ginning to sing softly. 

Man with a head-and-a-halj, 
come and get your half-head. 
Man with a head-and-a-halj. 
Come, so I can kill you . 

The song faded behind him until 
his stumbling feet carried him in 
through the great airdoor of the 
hotel and all things ended at once. 

H E WAS nearly four days re- 
covering and three days 
after that sitting around the Bor- 
der Hotel, making plans for the 
future with Willy. They had ad- 
joining rooms, each with a balcony 
looking out to the dawnrise side of 
the hotel. Heavy filterglass doors 
shut out the sunlight and protected 
the rooms’ air-conditioned inte- 
riors during the daytime. Kiev 
had agreed to go back to the Old 
Worlds with Willy, to get married 
and write and tell what he knew. 
There was nothing wrong with 
making a living any way you could 
back on the Old Worlds, even if 
it meant writing and lecturing. 



Only once did Willy bring up the 
subject of the mountains. 

“Why did Hehog let us pass?’’ 
she asked. 

He stared at her. 

“I thought that your eyes were 
closed.’’ 

“I opened them when you halt- 
ed. I closed them when I saw him. 
I thought it was all over then — and 
that he was going to kill us both. 
But you started walking and he let 
us pass. Why?’’ 

Kiev looked down at the thick 
brown carpet. 

“Hehog’s never going to get the 
message,” he said to the carpet. 

“What?” 

“Ancient Enemies — Johnson 

told me. Hehog thinks he and I are 
something special to each other 
with this Ancient Enemies busi- 
ness. We’re doomed to have one 
of us kill the other. We’re sup- 
posed to keep coming together 
until one of us gets the message 
to kill. Then the other just lets 
it happen. Because he’s doomed — 
there’s nothing he can do about 
it.” 

He stopped talking. For a min- 
ute she said nothing, either, as 
if she was waiting for him to go on 
explaining. 

“Hehog didn’t get the message 
when we walked past him?” she 
asked, at last. “Is that it?” 

“He’ll never get the message,” 
said Kiev dully. “He had two clear 
chances at me and he didn’t do 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



35 




anything. It means he thinks he’s 
the one who’s doomed. He’s wait- 
ing to die — for me to kill him.” 

“To kill him? Why would he 
want you to kill him? ” 

Kiev shrugged. 

“Answer me.” 

“How do I know?” Kiev said 
exhaustedly. “Maybe he’s getting 
old. Maybe he thinks it’s just time 
for him to die — maybe his mate’s 
dead.” 

There was momentary, somehow 
ugly silence. Then Willy spoke 
again. 

“Kiev.” 

“What?” 

“Look up here,” she said, sharp- 
ly. “I want you to look at me.” 

He r.aised his gaze slowly from 
the thick carpet and saw her face 
as stiffly fixed as it had been in the 
helmet on the last long kilometer 
to the hotel. 

“Listen to me, Kiev,” she said. 
“I love you and I want to live with 
you more than anything else for the 
rest of my life — and I’ll do any- 
thing for you I can do. But there’s 
one thing I can’t do. I just can’t.” 

He frowned at her, uneasy and 
restless. 

“I can’t help it,” she said. “I 
thought we were getting away from 
it here and that it wouldn’t matter 
But it does. If I can feel it there in 
you I go dead inside — I just can’t 
love you any more. That’s all there 
is to it.” 

“What?” he asked. 



Her hands made themselves 
into ineffective small fists in her 
lap, then uncurled and lay limp. 

“There are so many things I 
love about you,” she said emptily, 
“I thought I could ignore this one 
thing. But I can’t think so any- 
more. Not since we saw those two 
dead men — and not since the walk 
back here. Our love is just never 
going to work if you still want — 
want to kill. Do you understand? 
If you’re still wanting to kill it 
just won’t work out for us. Do 
you understand, Kiev?” 

The bottom seemed to fall 
out of his stomach. He was 
abruptly sick. 

“I told you that’s all over!” 
he shouted furiously at her. “I 
don’t want to kill anything!” 

“You don’t have to promise.” 
She rose to her feet, her face still 
tight. “It doesn’t matter if you 
promise. It only matters if you’re 
telling the truth.” 

. She turned and walked to the 
door of his hotel room. 

“It’s almost dawn,” she said. 
“I’m going down to see if the au- 
thorization for our spaceship tick- 
ets has come through for today’s 
flight — before the sun shuts off 
communications. I’ll be back in 
half an hour.” 

She went out. The door made no 
noise closing behind her. 

H E TURNED and flopped on 
the bed, stared up at the ceil-

IF 




ing. Everything was wonderful— 
or was it? He tried to think about 
the future in safety of the Old 
Worlds but his mind would not 
focus. After a bit he rose and 
walked out to the balcony. 

Before him stood the ramparts 
of the cliffs. On the balcony was 
an observation scope. He bent 
over it and fiddled with its con- 
trols until the boulders a kilo- 
meter away seemed to hang a 
dozen meters in front of him. 

He turned the sound pickup on. 

It was nearly time for the 
Udbahrs to be hunting their dens 
for the day but he heard no sing- 
ing. He panned the scope, search- 
ing the rocks. There it came — a 
faint wisp of melody. 

He searched the rock. The stone 
blurred before him. He lost then 
found the song again and closed in 
on it until the image in the screen 
of the scope locked on the figure 
of a male Udbahr standing deep 
between two tall boulders — an 
Udbahr wearing a transparent 
helmet and white jacket, with a 
sidearm in his hand. 

The song came suddenly loud 
and clear. 

Ancient , my enemy. Ancient, 
my enemy. 

No one but ourselves has the 
killing of each other . 

Man with a head-and-a-half, 
come and get your half -head. 

Man with a head-and-a-half 



Kiev stepped back from the 
scope. His head pounded sudden- 
ly. His stomach knotted. His 
throat ached. A fever blazed 
through him and his skin felt dry, 
dusty. He turned and strode across 
the room to his bag. He plowed 
through it, throwing new shoes, 
pants and shirts aside. 

His hand closed on the last hard 
item at the bottom. His gun. He 
jerked out the weapon, snatched 
up the long barrel for distance 
shooting and was snapping it in- 
to position on the gun even as 
he was striding toward the bal- 
cony. 

He applied the magnetic clamp 
of the gun butt to the scope and 
thumbed up the near lens of the 
telescopic sight. The red cross- 
hairs wavered, searched, found 
Hehog. It was a long shot. The 
lenses of the sight held level on the 
Udbahr in a straight line; but be- 
low them, on their gimbals, the 
barrel of the automatically sight- 
ing weapon was angled so that it 
seemed to point clear over the 
cliffs at the day that was coming. 
Kiev’s dry and shaking fingers 
curled around the butt. His fore- 
finger reached toward the firing 
button and instantly all the shak- 
ing was over. 

His grip was steady. His blood 
was ice but the fever still burned in 
his brain. As clearly as a vision be- 
fore him, he saw the mummified 
figures of Wadjik and Shant — 



ANCIENT, MY ENEMY 



37 




and Johnson as he had last seen 
the older man. 

Kiev pressed the firing button. 

From the cliffside came the 
sound of a distant explosion. A 
puff of rockdust plumed toward 
the whitening sky. A rising mur- 
mur, a mounting buzz of voices be- 
gan beyond the walls of his room. 
People began to appear on the sur- 
rounding balconies. 

Kiev faded back two steps, si- 
lent as a thief. Hidden in the shad- 
ows of the balcony he could still 
see what the others could not. 

Hehog lay beside one of the two 
boulders between which he had 
been standing. A blackish stain 
was spreading on the right side of 
his white jacket and the sidearm 
had fallen from his grip. 

He was plainly dying. But he 
was not yet dead. He began to sing 
again. 

Man with a head-and-a-half 
.... come and get your . 
half- head. 

Man with a head-and-a .... 



Through the pick-up of the 
scope Kiev, frozen in the shadows, 
could hear the Udbahr’s voice 
weakening. Then the door to the 
room slammed open behind him. 

“Kiev, did you hear it? Some- 
one shot from the Hotel — ” 

Willy’s voice broke off. 

He turned and saw her just in- 



side the door. She was gazing 
past him at the scope with its pic- 
ture of Hehog and the sound of 
Hehog’s weakening song coming 
from it. She stared at it. Then, 
slowly, as if she was being forced 
against her will, her eyes shifted 
until they met his. 

All the feeling in him that the 
sight of Hehog had triggered into 
life went out of him with a rush, 
leaving him empty as a disembow- 
eled man. 

“Willy — ” 

He took a step toward her. Her 
face twitched as if with a sudden, 
sharp, unbearable pain and her 
hand came up reflexively as if 
to push him away, though they 
were still more than half a room 
apart. 

Her throat worked but she made 
no sound. She struggled for an in- 
stant, then shook her head briefly. 
Still holding up her hand as if to 
fend him off, she backed away 
from him. The door opened behind 
her and let her out. 

The door closed, leaving him 
alone. He swung slowly back to 
face the scope. Hehog still lay 
framed in the lens and above that 
image the ominous light of day was 
fast whitening the sky. 

Hehog was still feebly singing; 
but the song had changed. Now it 
was the song Willy had asked Kiev 
to translate when she had first 
heard an Udbahr male. Kiev 
turned and flung himself facedown

IF 




on the bed, his arms over his head 
to shut out the sound. But the song 
came through to him. 

You desert me now, female. 
Because I am crippled. 
And yet, all my fault was 
That / did not lack courage. 
Therefore I will go now to the 
high rocks to die. 

And another will take you . 



The slow rumble of the heavy, 
opaque, thermal glass, sliding 
automatically across the entrance 
to the balcony, silenced the song in 
Kiev’s ears. Beyond the dark glass 
the sun of day broke at last over 
the rim of the cliffs and sent its 
fierce light slanting down. There 
was no mercy in that relentless 
light and all living things who did 
not hide before it died. •

NATIONAL COSMOGRAPHIC 
An Illustrated Feature 






T HEY made love together on a 
dead world. It was a grunting, 
hurried protest, a way of saying 
they still lived. It was perhaps 
more sane than laughing and safer 
than crying — and easier than be- 
ing alone. 

Better, it was a way to ignore 
each other. 

The too-bright sun of that dead 
world began to set and the shad- 
ows from the tall, broken towers 



of the city, mute testimonies of an 
alien and forgotten architecture, 
lengthened and covered them 
over. If the silence of a dead 
world can be said to do so, the 
silence grew deeper. At night it 
sometimes seemed to the two of 
them that they were the only life 
that world had ever seen and that 
the city was only a skeletal out- 
cropping of rock and stone. It 
would then seem to them that the 



40 






past had been quieter and that treaty with the night. They would 
the future was nonexistent. It was talk but they had long ago reached 
not a pleasant feeling — but ifn- an agreement never to say any- 
natural silences have a way of thing. Two people alone, alone 
working on your mind. They knew and scared, cannot afford to be- 
this and felt lucky to escape so come the best of friends. Friends 
easily. ' confide truths; that hope was lost. 

In the darkest parts of the night for instance. So all they could do 
they would try to talk and that was become lovers, 
seldom seemed to work. “I wonder — ” Cary mumbled. 

Unknowingly, even to them- He reached reflexively into his 
selves, they had arrived at a partial shirt pocket, searching for a pack 



41 




of cigarettes that was never there. 

“What do you wonder?” Nata- 
lie asked him, thinking he ex- 
pected a reply of her. 

“I wonder about death. I won- 
der what happened here. I think 
that they’ll never find us and I 
wonder if they’ll care. I wonder 
why I came here — and whether I 
would have if I had seen what was 
waiting.” He grinned and leaned 
across the alley toward her, 
“Sometimes — sometimes I won- 
der if I had met you back home — 
would I even have learned your 
name?” 

“Of course,” Natalie said. “We 
moved in the same circles and 
knew all the same scavengers. 
Sooner or later there would have 
been one piece of carrion we both 
would have gone for. It just hap- 
pened to be this one, that’s all.” 

Of the two of them Natalie was 
more frightened of friendship. Of- 
ten she would have to go out of her 
way to remind him of the danger. 
But she was not a cruel woman. 
She was merely young — and young 
people should never have to face 
death. It destroys their perspective 
and makes them fearful. Cary was 
older than she but he was still 
young enough. So he played the 
game, too. * 

“I’m going exploring,” he said. 
“Want to come?” 

“You going to the map room?” 
“Maybe. I suppose so.” 

“You go ahead then.” 



“Well, all right. See you later?” 
“I’m not going anywhere.” 

H E WALKED down the alley- 
ways until he came to the 
main quadrangle of the city. At 
first glance it seemed identical .to 
the other hundreds of quadran- 
gles. It was a small, square area, 
towers rising from each of its four 
corners. Tall, those towers were, 
some more than a hundred sto- 
ries. They were wide at the base 
and tapered smoothly to the top 
story. Yet they had an aura of be- 
ing squat and ugly — of being 
somehow evil. Cary had long 
since ceased being awestruck by 
the towers. You can get used to 
anything after a while, even to a 
repetitive architecture, alien and 
cold. 

But what never failed to arouse 
an emotion in him was a small 
statue on a pedestal in the middle 
of the blue lawn of that one quad- 
rangle. 

It was small, no more than three 
feet tall, and it was of a man and a 
woman. 

Cary moved closer and squatted 
d6wn to study it as he had done 
nearly every day since the crash. 
It had been the first thing they had 
found that gave any hint of the 
city’s past. Hint? No, more of a 
puzzle-piece, a very small one. But 
it was still the only native object of 
art they had found. Cary, for what 
must have been the hundredth 



42 



IF 




time, wondered what kind of peo- 
ple would live in a city where there 
was only one statue. No paintings, 
no fountains, only a small statue of 
a man and a woman. 

The figure of the man lay curled 
up, his hands pressed to his ears, 
his head bent over, seemingly 
ground into the stone pedestal. He 
seemed to be trying to cause him- 
self pain. 

The figure of the woman stood 
straight above him. Her head was 
tilted back and her eyes seemed to 
focus on a point above the tops of 
the towers around her. 

Cary raised himself to his feet 
and stood over the statue. He 
looked down into the blank stone 
eyes of the woman. 

“Whom are you looking for?” 
he whispered. 

Not that he expected she would 
answer him. He was twenty-four 
years old. His best friend had died 
in the crash and he expected to die 
soon himself, once the food at the 
ship gave out. He no longer ex- 
pected answers. 

Because he was young he re- 
fused simply to wait to starve. He 
made love and he explored. He 
wondered. One of the places he 
wondered about the most was in 
the map room. 

He entered the map room 
through the doorway in the base of 
the largest tower in the city. The 
doorway was the only other piece 
of ornamentation in the city. It 



was carved with what appeared to 
be designs but could have been 
lettering — or, for all he knew, 
warnings against unauthorized 
personnel. 

He and Natalie referred to it as 
the map room but it was more of 
an auditorium than a room. What- 
ever it was, all of the immense 
first floor of the tower was de- 
voted to it. The ceiling was a hun- 
dred feet overhead. It was the 
only tower they had found where 
the lighting system was still in 
working condition. The light had 
a slightly reddish cast, which was 
strange. The sun outside the tow- 
er was as yellow as that of 
Earth’s. The red light was one 
more puzzle-piece — like the stat- 
ue and the carvings on the door. 

But the walls of the room were 
the main body of the puzzle. The 
keystone that seemed to say to 
him that all the other pieces 
would fit snugly if he could only 
decipher the one big mystery. 
From the ceiling to ten feet above 
the floor, the walls were engraved 
with maps — starmaps. 

From the floor to the level of the 
maps, on each wall, were switches 
and dials and speaker grills, ar- 
ranged in columns and sections. 
One part of the right wall con- 
tained four maps in a column 
and below it there were four 
speaker grills. Each speaker was 
surrounded and separated from 
the others by switches and dials. 



NOW NO ONE WAITS 



43 




The first day Cary had spent in 
the room he had counted the 
speakers and maps. Simple multi- 
plication had supplied him with 
an accurate count, since every- 
thing was arranged geometrically. 
There were ten thousand each of 
maps and speakers. 

The maps seemed engraved on 
the walls, which the reddish light- 
ing of the room made appear deep 
black. 

Stars were shown as luminescent 
points of white. Many of the star 
patterns repeated and all matched 
the constellations that could be 
seen outside at night. But, break- 
ing the sameness of the patterns, 
tiny yellow crosses appeared at 
different places on each map, one 
on every map. 

Carry ran his hands softly over a 
group of switches. 

As he had done many times be- 
fore he closed one of the switches 
and, as usual, the speaker below it 
began to hiss softly, like a radio 
tuned between stations. 

It meant nothing to him and he 
cursed and almost savagely re- 
turned the switch to its previous 
position and the speaker to silence. 

Unnoticed above him a scarlet 
cross returned to glowing yellow. 

Y OU were out late last night,” 
Natalie said. “Did you find 
any food?” 

She managed to keep her voice 
noncommittal. 



“There’s none to be found. Any 
that might have been here spoiled 
a few centuries ago. You know 
that.” 

Cary talked to her with only 
one part of his mind — the other 
was still in the map room. 

“Perhaps we should cut back 
on the rations.” 

“But we’re already on half-ra- 
tions. Look, there’s no need to fool 
ourselves. The Institute could only 
afford to send out one probe and 
we were it. There’s no help com- 
ing — so there’s no need to pretend 
there is.” 

Cary looked reflectively at his 
empty ration bowl and stood up. 

“Where are you going?” Natalie 
asked. 

“I don’t know. Outside.” 

“You’re going back to the map 
room, aren’t you?” 

Her voice was frightened and 
small. 

“What of it?” 

“I don’t know, Cary. I just wish 
you’d stay away from there. It 
frightens me. The stars and the 
statue — the red lighting.” Her 
voice changed to a more pleading 
tone. “Are you sure we’ve looked 
everywhere for food?” 

“Yes,” Cary said angrily. “And 
as for the map room — for all we 
know it might hold the key to 
what we came here for, to Celes- 
tial Anomaly One. We were sent 
here to explain it and I’m not go- 
ing to give up on it. Otherwise I 



44 



IF 




might as well lie down and wait to 
die.” 

Half ashamed of his outburst, 
Cary threw his ration bowl into 
the trash receptacle and stalked 
out and away from the ship. Nata- 
lie watched him until he turned a 
corner and one of the towers of 
the city hid him from further view. 

T HEN, as she did every day, 
she went out to water the 
flowers, the flowers Dr. Cahn of 
the Institute had presented to her 
as a bon voyage gift — the flowers 
they had planted on Skip’s grave. 

They blossomed on a small plot 
of ground marked by a small 
white aluminum cross on the far 
side of the ship, away from the 
gaping rent the crash had ripped 
in the smooth alloy of the hull. 
They hadn’t wanted to bury their 
friend and pilot in a place where 
the ruined ship might seem to ac- 
cuse him of failure. 

At times Natalie dreamed of 
the crash and she would awaken 
screaming or whimpering. She 
had been at her post in Life-Sup- 
port Systems Control and Cary 
had been in the Engineering and 
Power Section. Skip had been on 
the Bridge. After they realized 
that the instructions they had been 
supplied with were useless they 
had decided to land on the planet. 

She had heard Skip scream, 
and knowing it was impossible for 
Cary to leave his own post during 



a landing, she had run to the 
Bridge to find their pilot moaning 
and ripping at the earphones he 
wore, whispering over and over, 
insanely, “Tell them to stop!” 

She seemed to remember Cary 
shouting instructions to her over 
the intercom as the ship made its 
first contact with the planet’s at- 
mosphere, trying to tell her how 
to control the ship. She thought 
that Skip might have come to his 
senses near the end and also have 
tried to help — but none of it had 
been good enough. Someone had 
forced her to the couch and had 
strapped her in. And then — chaos. 

When it was over Skip was 
dead. No one had strapped him 
to a couch and he had been too 
busy fighting the controls to do it 
for himself. She and Cary had 
been left alone on the planet — a 
planet that had no business even 
to exist. 

She imagined Skip’s voice. 

Tell them to stop! 

Shivering, she finished her task 
and returned to the ship. She 
went to the recorder she kept in 
her room and began speaking this 
day’s entry into it. She could not 
have said why she bothered. It 
might have been for no other rea- 
son than to hear herself talk, to 
fill the silence. She definitely nev-

“Day Ninety-One,” she began.

room and he now is spending 
more and more of his time there. 
I am worried about him — he 
grows more morose and sullen 
each day. He may be worrying 
about how we’ll get out or be feel- 
ing guilty that he has not yet 
found a way for us. But there is no 
way out. Every day our stores 
are depleted by two more ration 
packs and there is no food to be 
found in the city. It is a fact of life 
that in twenty-one more days I 
will report that all our stores have 
been used. Shortly after that I will 
be too weak to make further re- 
ports. And after that I shall be 
dead. 

“Celestial Anomaly One still re- 
mains unexplained. I am begin- 
ning to doubt that we even ar- 
rived in the right place. Cary has 
told me that mistakes in the Schu- 
bert Drive computers are impos- 
sible. Yet the Drive is so hew that 
I cannot help but wonder. Cer- 
tainly there is no trace of a neu- 
tron star anywhere in this region 
of this galaxy — let alone a neutron 
star with a captured secondary. 

“I am beginning to feel that we 
may have stumbled onto a more 
complex mystery than the Insti- 
tute sent us to find. The map 
room hints — ” 

She stopped and threw the mi- 
crophone across the room. It hit 
the tapestry on the wall and slid to 
the top of her bed. 

“It only hints,” she said, seat- 



ing herself on the edge of her bed 
and rubbing her fists into her 
eyes. “It only hints—” 

T HE map room occupied her 
thoughts for some time that 
night. That, and the % words in her 
own report — twenty-one days and 
she would begin to die by starva- 
tion. She felt lonely and fright- 
ened. She tried to wait up for 
Cary but he was later coming 
back than was usual. 

She feel asleep. 

She dreamed. 

She was back on the ship — but 
instead of Skip, Dr. Cahn of the 
Institute sat in the control chair. 
Where the bulkhead and the con- 
trol panel should have been the 
hull of the ship was transparent. 

A mist like a huge, dirty cloud 
seemed to form outside the ship. 
The cloud cleared and grotesque- 
ly, horribly, she saw a gigantic 
head floating in space where the 
planet should have appeared. It 
was Skip’s head and it was turn- 
ing around and over, bobbing ob- 
scenely back and forth. 

“Pulsars,” Doctor Cahn said, 
“may be very peculiar things.” 

In her dream Skip’s head ro- 
tated so that they were coming at 
it from beneath. Where the bloody 
stump should have been was only 
a smooth expanse of skin, as if no 
body had ever been attached 
there. 

She screamed to warn old Dr. 



46 



IF 




Cahn of the impending crash but 
he ignored her. Skip’s head and 
terrifying neck loomed larger and 
larger as they approached it. 

“You may find a neutron star,” 
Dr. Cahnremarked, unperturbed, 
“or you may find something even 
stranger.” 

He laughed, 

The ship’s orbit carried them 
around to the other side of the 
head-planet and she could see 
that Skip was laughing, too. His 
eyes were wide and bloodshot. 
Drool dripped from the corners of 
his mouth and formed silvery 
moons around him. 

“In nineteen seventy-three,” 
the doctor continued, “radio ob- 
servatories throughout the world 
were surprised to find a pulsar 
with an exceedingly rapid period 
suddenly transmitting from the 
vicinity of the Lesser Magellenic 
Cloud. They were further stunned 
when, a year later, it stopped 
broadcasting as suddenly as it had 
begun.” 

Skip was trying to say some- 
thing to her but she could not 
make him out. Every time his 
immense mouth moved Dr. Cahn 
would speak over Skip’s voice, 
which sounded like weak vibra- 
tions bouncing off the hull. 

“Celestial Anomaly One,” the 
doctor said, “may tell us what the 
pulsars are, how they were formed 
and how they die. While the new 
Schubert Drive is still only exper- 



imental, the Institute has wran- 
gled permission to send a probe 
out to the vicinity of the anomaly 
— roughly five hundred light years 
from Earth — ” 

She noticed that Skip was leer- 
ing>at her. She shuddered. 

“Anything you see while you 
are there, we on Earth will not 
have a chance to observe for five 
hundred years — even providing 
that the pulsar syndrome does be- 
gin again.” 

She could almost make out 
what Skip was shouting. 

"It’s a riddle,” old Dr. Cahn 
said. “It’s a riddle.” 

Skip’s head loomed larger and 
larger. Near the end she could just 
make out what he was saving. 

“Help me!” Skip’s head said. 
“Help me, help me. I’m dead. I’m 
dead! Why didn’t you help me?” 

The last thing she saw was a 
huge tear falling from his eye and 
then they crashed. 

She awoke screaming. 

S HE told Cary about the dream 
the next morning. 

“Don’t worry about it,” he said. 
“You’d just finished watering 
the flowers on his grave. With 
everything else that’s happening 
to us it’s only natural you should 
be having your share of night- 
mares. I shouldn’t have left you 
alone last night. I’m sorry, Nata- 
lie, but the more time I spend in 
that room, the more I think that

it will take just one more small 
thing — a clue I almost have and 
don’t see — and the whole thing 
will come clear. But don’t worry 
any longer about the dreams. 
You’ll take a pill tonight and it 
will keep dreams away.” 

“You don’t understand,” she 
said. “It was horrible. That head. 
He had no body at all, Cary. He 
couldn’t move out of our way — all 
he could do was talk and no one 
could hear him until it was too 
late.” 

Exhausted, she cradled her head 
on her arms. She listened to the 
hard clicking noises Cary’s boots 
made as he paced up and down 
the stateroom. 

“No body at all,” she mumbled 
sleepily. 

She heard him pull out a chair 
and seat himself. 

“Wait a minute,” he said 
thoughtfully. “Wait just one min- 
ute.” 

She raised her head to glance at 
him. His face was thoughtful and 
his fingers drummed on the table 
top. He stared directly into her 
eyes and she shivered. His face 
had taken on the same expression 
Skip’s had worn before Cahn had 
crashed into it. 

“What did you say?” he asked. 
“Repeat what you said about Skip 
in your dream.” 

“It was horrible,” she said. She 
closed her eyes and she could still 
see it. “He had no body. All he 



could do was talk. And we 
couldn’t hear him and then the 
ship just — ” 

“Come on,” Cary said. He 
stood up and placed his hand on 
her arm. “Let’s go.” 

“But why, Cary?” 

“I think you’ve given me an 
idea. I hope I’m wrong, though. I 
only hope I’m wrong.” 

Shortly they came to the main 
quadrangle and, without pausing 
to look at the statue, Cary pro- 
pelled her into the map room. 

“All right,” Cary said. “Start 
pulling switches.” He demon- 
strated by pulling an oblong 
switch above one of the speakers. 
The speaker hissed and a yellow 
cross turned scarlet. 

“You’re crazy.” Natalie said. 

“Pull the switches!” he said; 
surprised to hear himself shouting. 
“The oblong ones over the speak- 
ers — do it now.” 

He slammed home another 
switch. 

“But, there are ten thousand of 
them,” Natalie said, angry and 
confused. 

“Start!” 

He continued pulling switches, 
his back to her. But when he 
heard the clicking as she also be- 
gan pulling the switches he smiled 
grimly. In approximately three 
and a half hours they had fin- 
ished. 

Ten thousand scarlet crosses 
glittered on a background of stars. 



48 



IF 




O NE entire section of the far 
wall swung silently open to 
reveal a short staircase. They 
climbed the staircase to the second 
floor of the tower. They were in 
another map room much like the 
one beneath it but in this one 
there were only one thousand 
maps and one thousand sets of 
switches and no speakers. Each 
map had ten yellow crosses. There 
were one thousand of the oblong 
switches, all closed. It took them 
less than an hour to open them all 
and soon there were one thousand 
scarlet crosses. 

And another door. They lost no 
time in opening it. 

Wordlessly, they entered the 
third level where there were one 
hundred maps and one hundred 
switches, no speakers and one 
hundred crosses on each map. 

They were soon in the last level 
which proved accessible to them. 
There was one map. It was a map 
with ten thousand crosses shining 
on it and it stretched from one 
end of the ceiling to the other and 
covered the walls to within four 
feet of the floor. The room was 
shaped like a half-sphere, so that 
the map appeared to be the actual 
sky outside the tower — as if seen 
on a clear night through a glass 
plate emblazoned with ten thou- 
sand illuminated crosses. 

There were two switches. One 
was quite large and was sur- 
rounded by a hundred dials, all of 



which were registering at the far 
left of their scales. 

But on the other side of the 
room was a much smaller switch 
and below it dangled a pair of ear- 
phones. 

“Natalie,” Cary said, “I’m go- 
ing over there and putting on 
those earphones. If for any reason 
you think you should do so, pull 
them off me.” 

He put on the earphones. With- 
in two seconds he was clawing at 
them and whimpering. 

Natalie screamed his name. She 
felt unable to move. 

Cary fell to his knees, then full 
length to the floor. His body 
curled into the fetal position. He 
appeared to shrivel. His eyes 
closed. His mouth opened as if he 
were about to scream but no 
sound came. Sweat glistened on 
his brow and ran down over his 
eyelids. Small beads of blood 
dripped from his palms where his 
fingernails had dug in. His throat 
vibrated rapidly as his neck mus- 
cles worked — still he did not 
scream. 

Natalie finally managed to pull 
the earphones from his head. For 
a moment there was no discern- 
ible change in his position, or his 
rigidity. 

Then he began to cry. Dry, 
moaning sobs racked his body. He 
raised himself to his knees, then to 
his feet. Natalie drew back as he 
glanced at her. His eyes seemed 



NOW NO ONE WAITS 



49 




haunted. They did not focus on 
her. It was as if he had gone 
blind. 

“What happened? Oh Cary!” 

“I can’t explain,” Cary said. 
His voice was still unsteady. He 
took the earphones from her. “Put 
these on for a second — then you’ll 
understand. No, wait — I’ll hold 
them to your ears and then yank 
them off. More than a few seconds 
wouldn’t be safe. I at least had an 
idea what to expect.” 

She was too fearful to protest. 

The next thing she knew she 
was whirling. Her identity spun 
around and around. Voices, all 
speaking unknown languages, 
hammered at her. One, two, one 
hundred, a thousand, ten thou- 
sand voices, perfectly distinct, 
competing, blending, all battering 
at her mind. 

And all ten thousand of them 
were voices of terror. 

It was like ten thousand heretics 
screaming at the stake. Like the 
wails of ten thousand women being 
stoned — like the screeches of ten 
thousand hopeless, helpless peo- 
ple about to die. 

And all of them were audible. 
The young ones and the old ones. 
The women, the men, the babies. 
Harsh gutteral words and soft, 
singing Cantonese cants. Mono- 
syllabic grunts and polysyllabic 
wheezes. All of them like waves 
wearing away at butter-soft lime- 
stone. 



She felt her mind eroding, too. 
She screamed. 

Cary’s face swam into focus be- 
fore her. His concerned eyes 
looked deep into her. 

“Are you okay?” he asked. 

“They’re all dead,” she heard 
herself say. “They’re all dead. 
Aren’t they?” 

“I think so,” Cary said. 

“What is this place?” 

“I think I know now, Natalie. 
It doesn’t help us any. We’re still 
going to die. But at least we’ll be 
able to think, to know, that we’re 
only a small part of a larger trag- 
edy. That our deaths will be 
meaningless and therefore unim- 
portant. You may want to die af- 
ter you know what I know now. 
They had no body, Natalie — all 
they had was a voice.” 

“T DON’T want to go insane, 
-l*Cary. I don’t want to go insane 
alone.” She moved closer to him 
and sat beside him on the floor 
under the huge map. But she did 
not touch him — she was afraid to 
touch him. She had barely enough 
courage to listen and that was 
courage bom of the first stages of 
insanity. To listen was to take the 
first step to fulfillment of a death- 
wish. As he began to speak she 
could see the chasm gaping open 
before her, ready to receive her 
mind. She knew that she would 
fall. 

“We discovered a faster-than- 



50 



IF 




light drive, Natalie, but they 
missed it. It’s not surprising, real- 
ly. It was mostly an accident that 
we found it at all and we didn’t 
really need it. But they looked for 
it when they needed it — and it 
eluded them.” 

He was quiet for a moment. He 
lay back and stared up at the 
map. The tiny points of light 
from the crosses and stars illumi- 
nated his face dimly and glints of 
light reflected from his eyes. 

“This world found only a voice. 
FTL radio. And it wasn’t alone. 
There were ten thousand others. 
It must have been frustrating. To 
listen to the voices from far worlds, 
to learn other beings’ languages 
and never be able to meet them. 
Hundreds of years — and every few 
years a new voice would be discov- 
ered. And then something hap- 
pened — some threat came. What- 
ever it was they couldn’t meet it 
and they couldnlt escape it.” 

“So they called for help.” Nat- 
alie said for him. She heard her 
own voice fill with the agony that 
had been in Cary’s. She shared 
the secret with him. “They built 
this city two hundred years ago, 
in nineteen seventy-three, as a 
relay station. Ten thousand worlds 
cried for help, and this one place 
blended the called, broadcasted 
them and waited. No help came 
and the voices were silent.” 

“Yes,” Cary said. “That would 



explain it. Two hundred years ago 
a pulsar formed here — one more 
powerful than any other known — 
and only a year later it had van- 
ished. When Earth could, it sent 
someone to find out the cause. 
That’s us. We got here a hundred 
and ninety-nine years too late. 
But we found a tombstone. One 
desperate circuit left on broadcast- 
ing on a regular frequency on a 
normal wave. Like a shroud.” 

It was again quiet in the room 
until Natalie spoke. 

“Is that what happened to 
Skip? The tombstone broadcast?” 
“I suppose so. We knew — or at 
least had an inkling — of what to 
expect and we heard it only for a 
few seconds each. He was forced 
to listen for nearly an hour. It’s 
no wonder he went mad.” 

“What can we do?” Natalie 
asked. 

Cary walked to the large switch 
and threw it open. A soft and gen- 
the vibration shook the room. 

“I’ve turned the pulsar back 
on,” he said. “They’ll send some- 
one else out here now. We’ll likely 
be dead by then but we’ll leave 
our notes to be found.” 

“If only they had used light- 
speed transmissions,” Natalie 
said. “We could have deciphered 
those.” 

“What good would that have 
done?” Cary asked. “It would 
have reached us one hundred 
years from now — and as it stands 



NOW NO ONE WAITS 



51 




we’re nearly two hundred years 
too late.” 

“Let’s go back to the ship,” 
she said. 

T HEY left the tower and had 
walked more than half-way 
back to the ship before they could 
no longer hear the humming of 
the generators, the vibrations of 
the pulsar. 

They slept. They ate. Their ra- 
tions disappeared as inexorably 
as before but they no longer no- 
ticed. They no Longer cared. 

“We’ll die here,” Natalie said 
one night as they lay together. “It 
seems to be a place to die.” 

Cary reached across the bed 
and pulled her closer to him but 
there seemed to be no meaning in 
his action. His body was as lifeless 
as his words. 

“There have been so many 
deaths — I doubt that two more 
will even be noticed. How many 
lives could end on ten thousand 
worlds?” 

There was no answer to his 
question and the silence again 
covered them. Each lay awake 
and imagined shapes and night- 
mares fleeing through the dark. 
Each of them thought of the tow- 
ers and the city and of what it 
would be to share death with so 
many. They did not make love. 
They had not made love for many 
nights. Death had made them 
friends and they knew each other 



too well even to pretend they were 
strangers. They could not substi- 
tute life for death or love for fear 
— and they would not lie to each 
other or to themselves. 

Day came and they scarcely 
heeded it. Their actions were rou- 
tine, automatic, divorced from 
what they thought and felt. 

Cary ran his hands over the 
controls of the ship. He tested the 
circuits of the Life-Support Sys- 
tems as he had every day. He 
made his daily entry in the log 
and checked all functional instru- 
ment readings. 

For a moment he did not be- 
lieve what he saw on the board. 
He double-checked the reading 
and verified it. He waited for the 
wave of emotion to hit him. He 
was not surprised to notice that 
what he had seen did not affect 
him. 

“Natalie,” he said and then 
realized he was whispering. He 
repeated her name more loudly 
and she turned to him. “Normal- 
space radar has picked up another 
ship just outside atmosphere. I 
can’t signal them but they must 
be here for us. We’re rescued.” 

He tried to inject gaiety into his 
voice but he could only think of 
death. 

Natalie leaned over the board 
to check the reading. When she 
spoke her voice, too, sounded 
drab and lifeless. 

“So they sent another ship,” 



52 



IF 




she said. “So old Cahn must car- 
ry more weight than we thought — 
they did outfit a second expedi- 
tion. How long before they get 
here?” 

“A couple days maybe.” 

“Are you happy?” she asked. • 
“No. I don’t know, I guess I 
am. But it all seems so useless.” 
They spent the night talking 
like sad children. They were try- 
ing to recapture their images of 
Earth, their will to live. But in the 
morning they felt the same. 

“There’s someone outside,” 
Cary said. “I’ll open the hatch for 
him.” 

Natalie and Cary watched on 
the viewscreen as the man out- 
side stepped through the dilating 
hatch. 

“Not our uniform,” Natalie 
said. “Have you ever seen one 
like that before?” 

“No,” Cary answered. “But 
look.” He pointed at another sec- 
tion of the board. “According to 
our radar the ship is still in orbit. 
I don’t understand — ” . 

“Perhaps they sent down a 
shuttle vehicle. They’re here, I 
suppose that’s all that matters.” 
The man entered the control 
room. He was taller than he had 
appeared on the viewscreen, he 
smiled at the two of them. 

Cary motioned him to sit and 
gave his report. He told their res- 
cuer about the tombstone they 
had landed on and about death. 



He listened to himself talk and 
was surprised that his voice re- 
mained so steady. He saw Natalie 
standing and crying silently in the 
far corner of the control room. He 
knew she was not crying from re- 
lief. He wondered how long it 
would be before he broke down 
himself — and whether he would 
ever be able to fit the pieces back 
together once he let them fall. He 
doubted he could but he didn’t 
care. 

Suddenly he saw that the man 
he was speaking to was smiling 
widely. He stammered and broke 
off his report. 

“And where are the skeletons?” 
the man asked. 

Cary was speechless. He forced 
himself to control his anger. 

“I don’t know. What difference 
does it make? Perhaps they had 
no bone structure. It doesn’t mat- 
ter. They’re dead. Haven’t you 
heard anything I’ve said?” 

The visitor grinned. 

“Listen to me,” he said, “it was 
decided there is a debt that must 
be paid. There are things you 
have to know — it would not be 
right if you never learned them. I 
am part of a rescue attempt. But 
not your rescue — that will not 
take place for another twenty-two 
hours. My own rescue mission 
stretches across seven centuries 
and involves the people of four 
galaxies. 

“Ten thousand worlds did cry 



NOW NO ONE WAITS 



53 




out for help and you two heard 
them. But not too late. When you 
are rescued you will file a report 
with the Institute. We know this 
because we have that report, that 
report which had been saved in 
the computer files for decades, 
centuries. Nothing, Cary, is be- 
yond man’s grasp. First he wanted 
to fly and he built himself wings. 
Then on to the planets of his own 
system and then to the stars. 
Whatever man has wanted to do, 
whatever he felt a strong enough 
desire to do, he has or he surely 
will do. 

“A strong desire.” The man re- 
peated the words and he seemed 
to be holding back his own tears. 
“To save a life is one desire. To 
save the lives on ten thousand 
worlds became nearly an obses- 
sion. A way was found. Seven 
hundred years from now, in your 
time, that way will be found and 
it will be applied. In my frame of 
reference, it has been applied.” 

He extended his hand toward 
them. “The people of ten thou- 
sand worlds have asked me to ex- 
tend their hand of friendship and 
thanks to you, Natalie and Cary, 
across the boundaries of both 
time and space. You were the ones 
who heard their cry for help. It 
took us seven hundred years to 
find a way to answer but without 



your understanding the cry might 
have gone unheard.” 

Cary took the man’s hand and 
Natalie placed hers on both of 
theirs. 

“Rescued through time,” Nata- 
lie said softly. “But still— how can 
we believe you? How can we ever 
know for sure? We must be sure.” 

“I can tell you nothing else,” he 
said, “only that you had better 
go quickly when your second expe- 
dition arrives. The catastrophe 
you thought had already hap- 
pened will begin two months from 
this time-date.” He laughed, “It 
wouldn’t be healthy to still be 
around. Be sure and file that re- 
port — oh, hell, I know for a fact 
that you did.” 

He left then, and Natalie and 
Cary awaited their own rescuers. 
For a while they still had their 
doubts and fears, but then they 
remembered and understood. 

It was Natalie who first said it. 

“The statue,” she said, and she 
smiled for the first time in many 
days. “The statue!” Then Cary 
remembered also and together 
they took one more walk on the 
world that had never died. 

They walked to the main quad- 
rangle. There, on the blue lawn, 
was the small statue. Of a man 
and of a woman, overcome by a 
cry for help. A tiny statue— and 
they now knew whom it honored. •

ating what becomes known in re- 
trospect, then, as “memory” or 
“loss.” Turn it around, stumble to

there. 

You can’t fool around with 
time. 

As I said, think about it. Max 
Robin did. He couldn’t think very 
well, of course, having been de- 
prived of the educational advan- 
tages of secondary school, under- 
graduate school, graduate school, 
professional school. Nevertheless, 
and within certain crude limits, Jie 
tried. He was a born thinker. So 
much so that he even ended up in 
the library now and then and 
struggled with microfilms of ob- 
scure professional journals — not 
that he was sure he understood 
what they were all about. He went 
through the almost unbearable 
exegesis of men who probably 
looked much like himself — he did 
so with loathing but nevertheless 
driven. Eventually, of course, the 
effort drove him even crazier than 
he had been in the first place. 

Consider Max. He is one of 
those dim, anonymous men you 
find eating lunches from paper 



bags at the Automat, steaming 
cups of tea somewhere to the left 
of the numb, stricken, stunned 
gaze. Or — oh, yes — going through 
microfilms and ancient newspa- 
pers at the public library. Wide, 
staring eyes slammed into a face 
emerging almost indifferently from 
a drab checked shirt, uncashed 
unemployment check nestling in 
the breast pocket. That kind of 
thing. Now and then he cursed 
strange young women on the sub- 
ways for displaying their bodies. 
But Max had (or has) this one 
enormous obsession. It redeems 
him. It even purifies, as great ob- 
sessions have been known to do. 
He wants, to travel in time. All 
the way back. All the way for- 
ward. What’s the difference? 

The important thing is to punch 
through to the end and get some 
damned answers. Probably looks 
the same at either end. 

Never mind why. Who knows? 
Why do some men go to the West 
Coast, some become touts; still 
others yearn to be published 
writers — these are the really dan- 
gerous ones — or absconding stock- 
brokers. The analysis of selection 
is not within our compass. This is 
a fiction piece. Max Robin wanted 
to move in time. 

It would be really great to know 
the way everything is— put me 
one up on the sonsofbitches. 

Unlike potential writers or ab- 
sconders, however, Max’s possi- 



56 



IF 




bilities were not clearly defined 
for him. He lacked precedent, a 
sense of history. The writer always 
has the rejection slip, the stock- 
broker the SEC. 

The potential time traveler, 
however, is in a bind. As you 
know, time machines do not exist 
at present — neither do time travel- 
ers (this proves the point that it 
was never invented— surely we 
would otherwise have been vis- 
ited.) Not even what we might call 
prevailing literature; exists on the 
subject, let alone a how-to kit. Oh, 
there are science-fiction stories 
and novels, of course, but for Max 
at least these did not count. They 
deal with extrapolation, specula- 
tion and so on, usually with an al- 
most apologetic air of clinging dis- 
reputability. Despite the increas- 
ing popularity of these works in 
the Speculative Sixties, Max Rob- 
in found himself repelled by the 
category. 

It ain't got nothing to do with 
reality. 

Consider him now more specif- 
ically if you will, please. Max Rob- 
in, forty-eight years old, more than 
a little battered on the top with 
white patches which would be less 
ominous if they were simple bald- 
ness, the familiar dull eyes now 
suspended openly in his skull as 
he looks at something — a con- 
traption — he has constructed in 
his room. 

I did it. ^nd I ain't even got no 



degrees. I built it myself, by golly! 

He means this to be a recollec- 
tion but since you and I are al- 
ready in the room the thought 
comes out rather as an announce- 
ment. 

T HE something we are looking 
at is about four feet high and 
wide, six feet in depth (the pro- 
portions, then, very much like 
Max’s own), made of coils and 
wires and dangerously frayed elec- 
tric cords of some sort. Power 
must be on because static leaps 
from one coil to the next but it 
does so without purpose, without 
even that venom and air of danger 
which can be associated with bad 
machinery in abrupt decline. Sus- 
pended at the heart of the network 
is a pocket watch which dangles 
from an uncoiled paper clip. It 
ticks feebly. It indicates to us — we 
have excellent eyesight, the two of 
us — that the hour is two-thirty and 
we make the inference that it is 
morning from the absence of light 
through the uncurtained windows. 
Then again, thanks to certain ar- 
chitectural innovations, it is al- 
most always dark in Max’s two- 
room, furnished. He prefers it that 
way. 

“Son of a gun,” Max says rever- 
ently. “I think I’ve gone and in- 
vented it. It really looks as if it’s 
going to work. It’s my time ma- 
chine, all mine.” He can be ex- 
cused, after all his months of 



WHAT TIME WAS THAT?

struggle, a little megalomania. 
“No one else would have had the 
guts to do it,” Max says. “Only 
Max Robin could work it out.” 

He would prefer, of course, to 
address these remarks to an au- 
dience. Max, like most creative 
geniuses, is not above a little hu- 
man contact applied in small 
doses, used sparingly. Unfortu- 
nately he has no companions in 
these rooms. There have been no 
visitors since the day several 
months ago when Max, taking his 
ease in customary fashion, was in- 
terrupted by his landlady’s de- 
mands for rent. After he subse- 
quently took her firmly by a heavy 
arm, threw her out of what he 
called his “chambers” and stated 
that if she ever returned he would 
evict her, his rooms have been 
without guests. Since the lady at 
issue is something of a sadi-maso 
(I hope I am using these terms cor- 
rectly; I am not a specialist) she 
accepted this dictum without won- 
der and their relationship, such as 
it is, has more recently devolved 
around Max’s occasional, convul- 
sive payments of rent. At the mo- 
ment, locked in his regret. Max 
would even have settled for his 
landlady. 

Since you and I are already 
here, however, we may suffice. Or- 
dinary fellows, both of us, but in 
the “right place at the right time” 
as they say, and therefore the best 
of all alternatives. It is necessary, 



however, to introduce ourselves. 

I do so in the most graceful — if 
abrupt — manner possible. Max is 
not a man interested in social in- 
tricacies. Stepping forward the few 
necessary inches to bring Max’s 
attention to me, I say, “Congratu- 
lations? Is that the time machine? 
Did you just invent it?” 

All questions. I am not sure of 
anything. 

Max considers us with mild ap- 
probation, satisfied that we exist 
and not interested in pursuing the 
matter beyond that. It would be 
strange if he did. Max takes most 
things in his life — there being so 
very, very few — for granted. 

“Yeah,” he says, “that’s mine. 
I did it.” 

“Does it really work?” 

“I’m pretty sure it does. I don’t 
know for a fact, though. It’s never 
been tested. I’ll be making a trial 
run in just a minute, now, just as 
soon as I knock off this cigarette.” 

I note that Max’s eyes, during 
the last part of this, have wan- 
dered over and set on you, without 
eagerness, but with that slow, 
dawning suspicion which is, per- 
haps, Max’s most characteristic 
manner of confronting the uni- 
verse. Anxious to avert a scene — 
which for reasons I will not go into 
would be highly complex — I say 
hurriedly, ”He’s a friend of mine. 
He just came along with me.” 

You nod to this, beam and try in

statement for Max. Like me — al- 
though speechless in your case — 
you do not wish to involve Max in 
an extended analysis of your pres- 
ence. But he averts all this by 
shrugging and turning away. It is 
difficult, at times, to maintain the 
fiction that important inventors 
maintain their own fiction of in- 
volvement. 

Max knocks out the cigarette, 
considers the machine for some 
time and says, “Well, I guess I’d 
better get going if I want to take 
it for the trial run.” 

“We’ll be watching,” I say. 

“It’s geared to send me back fif- 
teen minutes in time and leave me 
there. Just for the trial run, that is. 
I figure if I’m lucky I meet up with 
myself and we have a conversation 
or something — then I vanish. Or 
go away. I ain’t gone any further 
than that. I don’t have that kind 
of mind.” 

“That’s perfectly all right,” I 
assure him. 

“I mean, how much can a man 
do?” Max asks rather sullenly, I 
think. “I invented the damned 
thing. That’s enough. How do I 
know how it’s going to work or 
anything like that?” 

“Sounds all right to me,” I say. 
“Doesn’t it?” 

I indicate that you should nod 
and obediently you do, round- 
eyed. With a sharp, covert gesture 
I indicate to you that you are on 
the point of sucking your thumb 



and warn you to withdraw it, sir. 

“Of course,” Max says, “it 
could go completely haywire. No- 
body ever done this kind of thing 
before. How can I make any 
guarantees? I don’t know i/ I 
should be on the trial run. I in- 
vented it, after all. I’m too impor- 
tant to waste. What if it blows?” 
“I’m sure it couldn’t,” I say. 

I consider him with what I hope 
he interprets as high admiration, 
even trust. For reasons which will 
develop shortly I am not interested 
in crossing Max. 

“You want to go?” he asks. 
“Can’t do it,” I say regretfully. 
“Wish I could but I have a bad 
stomach. I can’t take conveyances 
of any kind.” 

“Oh, you really wouldn’t be 
traveling, you know. You’d just 
sort of be moving along in — ” 

“I’m sorry,” I say delicately. 
“All the same principle. Terrible 
nausea. I might spoil your ma- 
chine if you put me in there.” 

HAT stops him. 

“That’s a point,” he says. He 
tilts a finger to his chin, considers 
the ceiling. “That makes sense. 
What about him, then?” 

He points to you. 

“Oh, he’s just along to keep me 
company,” I say. “Here for the 
ride, so to speak. I don’t think he’d 
make the right subject for an ex- 
periment. He can’t talk, you see, 
and he couldn’t tell you any of his 




WHAT TIME WAS THAT? 



59 




impressions. He came out that 
way. He just couldn’t — ” 

“Well,” Max says cunningly. 
“Well.” The cunning is manifested 
as a subtle flush which cleaves his 
face in half, gives those halves 
the preternatural appearance of 
gloating cross-eyed at one another. 
“It doesn’t matter that he’s a dum- 
my or something. The important 
thing is that he breathes and we’ll 
know if he keeps on breathing.” 

He reacts in an explosion of 
agility, a series of motions too 
rapid to follow even if I have 
any interest in following them, 
which I certainly do not. When it 
is all over you have been hurled 
into dead center of the contrap- 
tion, a belt winched loosely around 
your waist. Max rubs his hands 
and moves toward a switch. 

“Look, Max,” I say, trying to 
explain, even though there is noth- 
ing after all, to discuss. “You 
shouldn’t have bothered doing 
that. You see, you’ll only — ” 

“Too late, brother,” he says 
with some satisfaction. A switch is 
closed and there is a sound of 
breaking glass, a dispersion of 
smoke. When I recover my vision 
it is quite obvious that you are 
gone. I take this with regret, if 
without surprise. It means that I 
must go almost all the rest of the 
way alone, now. 

“Well, it does something,” Max 
says, considerably subdued by that 
knowledge. The ultimate pity of 



his condition is that he did not be- 
lieve the machine would work. He 
had not fully realized this truth 
about himself until this moment 
and the resultant depression was 
strong, even for Max Robin. “Now 
I guess we have to wait and see if 
the guy comes back in fifteen min- 
utes. If he does, I guess I got it 
made. I’ll get a patent.” 

“No, you won’t,” I say sadly. 
“He’s never coming back.” 

“How can you say a thing like 
that? Just tell me how you come off 
saying something like that!” Max 
shouts. Suddenly, he is completely 
discomfited, riding on the raw 
edges of his Automat-nerve, back 
with the microfilm. “If it works 
he’ll come back.” 

“They never come back. Be- 
cause time moves ahead,” I say, 
still feeling the pointless sorrow. 
“So his fifteen minutes will never 
catch up with yours. You’ll run in 
a straight line forever, like blind 
cross-qpuntry runners. We could 
have told you all of this if you’d 
listened. That’s what we came 
back here for, as a matter of fact. 
To tell you. But now it’s entirely 
too late and things will just have to 
work themselves out.” 

“What work themselves out? 
What cross-country runners? 
What coming back?” It is a little 
too much for Max. “Listen, I don’t 
really have to listen to this. I’ll go 
out for a drink or something and 
leave you here. The hell with you.” 



60 



IF 




“You can’t leave. You see, you 
can’t get out. Max,” I say, hoping 
that he will listen, spreading my 
arms to convince him of my utter 
sincerity. “Max, you’re already in 
the machine.” 

“Me? In the machine?” 

“Whom do you think you put 
in there?” 

Max blinks, shakes himself 
slightly like a confused dog. “This 
is just like science fiction,” he 
says. “I told you, there’s no such 
thing. I figured it all out. Time is 
time — you can’t fool around with 
it. You never meet yourself and 
you never change the past, you just 
kind of move around in it all the 
way back and forth. I know that.” 
“That’s your theory. Now, if 
you’ll excuse me, my fifteen min- 
utes are up. I really can’t stay, you 
see. Not any longer.” 

I leave. Actually it has been ex- 
tremely close. I clear Paradox by 
only a matter of seconds. But clear 
it I do and now I am gone. 

Quite alone in his room, then, 
the inventor Max Robin stands 
in the silence, looking at his ma- 
chine. It hums peculiarly and 
there is a sawing noise, then a 
sound of distant plopping. 

Max stares with wonder. 

It is happening now. Right this 
moment, it is happening. But 



there is no one to warn or even to 
audit him so Max can only watch 
it occur. 

And so, then, from all corners of 
the mighty time machine — from 
all the crevices and interior spaces 
— Max Robin is coming out. There 
are five of him, ten of him, eleven, 
fifteen and a thousand and they 
are all falling on the floor, strug- 
gling against one another to wiz- 
ened, tiny feet, trying to stagger 
toward him. Their eyes are wild. 
They are almost as wild as his own. 
The mouths — wee, gaping mouths 
— are saying words. They are try- 
ing to make some kind of a point. 

Unfortunately they are barely 
coherent. 

“I told you not to mess around 
with this, you bum,” is what they 
are trying to say. “If you had stuck 
to your rolls and your sex-dreams 
none of this would have happened. 
But now, look. Look — ” 

Since they are all Max Robin 
himself, however, this fails to come 
out with the necessary forceful- 
ness. Max never had much self- 
respect anyway. 

Then they turn on him and be- 
gin to strike. 

That works. 

It should. 

He is, after all, severely outnum- 
bered. • 



WHAT TIME WAS THAT?

all I ever was or might be was col- 
lapsing inexorably inward, toward 
that imaginary point two inches 
behind my eyes where the essen- 
tial me had always dwelt. I was 
dying. I was a bodyless point of 
ego in a sea of final nothingness, a 
mote beating frantically against 
the night. 

I was dying. Never to breathe 
the air of Earth again, never to 
feel Loy’s body against mine, nev- 
er to know pain, never even to 
drift in the private world behind 
my own eyelids. 

I was dying and, as men do 
when they have time to contem- 
plate the moment, I was dying 
badly, a crazed whimpering thing 
crying futilely against the dark. I 

I shrieked once in my fading 
mind, had time to think briefly of 
Loy, to say goodbye forever to the 
image of her in my mind. And I 
was not.

brains, pulsing and squirming hid- 
eously, brains supported by slimy 
green bodies like dog-sized slugs. 
This was not heaven. This was the 
fifth planet of a yellow sun far, far 
from Sol. I was alive and I began 
to remember. 

The first thing I remembered 
was Loy. Where was she? What 
were they doing to her? 

I found myself screaming her 
name. 

I felt a pressure in my mind, a 
presence, cold and v clammy, with- 
out passion, without malice, with- 
out emotion, without mercy. A 
pressure that was a questioning, a 
search, a leaching. I began to re- 
member more. 

Fifth planet of a yellow sun. A 
fair green world, not like the oth- 
ers Loy and I had found. Loy — 
my love, my woman, my wife. A 
honeymoon world, a world fit for 
colonization, hence a world where, 
by the terms of the contract, we 
could spend the remaining six 
months of our Honeymoon Year 
enjoying the green grass and the 
blue sky and the fresh clean air. 
No more weeks in space in the 
cramped two-place Scout, no more 
methane worlds, chlorine worlds, 
jungle worlds, desert worlds. 

The Honeymoon World, the 
Jackpot World, the Bonus World. 

Death World. 

“Loy. Loy. Loy.” 

The circle of gray, quivering 
brains seemed to pulse faster, as 



63 




if with some not-quite-familiar 
strain, and I felt the pressure in 
my mind change, reach for lan- 
guage concepts in my brain, pick, 
choose and form words. 

The woman is elsewhere , the 
words that were and were not of 
my mind told me. Elsewhere. 

The fog began to evaporate 
from my memory. 

We had surveyed the planet 
from orbit and, finding it fair and 
habitable, we had landed the 
Scout in a lush green meadow 
close by wooded hills. 

Loy smiled at me as we stepped 
out of the airlock and inhaled the 
fragrant heady odors of growing 
things. 

“There,” she said, putting her 
arm around my waist. “Now aren’t 
you glad we decided to take a 
Honeymoon Contract?” 

“We were so right,” I said with 
a little laugh. 

The idea had been hers in the 
first place. My attitude had been 
that the government was not 
about to give something for noth- 
ing. A Honeymoon Contract 
sounded like the best of all pos- 
sible deals. The government pro- 
vided any couple who could pass 
the minimal physical and psycho- 
logical tests with a two-place Scout 
to roam the stars together for a 
year. All we had to do in return 
was make a brief survey of each 
planet we found and, if we were 
lucky enough to find one suitable 



for colonization, we could spend 
the rest of our year on it and col- 
lect a bonus that would set us up 
for life when we returned to 
Earth. 

Of course, the government did 
not act out of sentiment. The hu- 
man race needed room to expand 
and expansion meant new planets. 
Perhaps one out of fifty solar sys- 
tems had a habitable one. The 
economical way to find it was to 
send out plenty of cheap, two- 
place Scouts. Under ordinary con- 
ditions, two people simply could 
not stay sane cooped up alone for 
a year in the vastness of interstel- 
lar space. But a man and a woman? 

Necessity had made a hard gov- 
ernmental policy out of an ancient 
romantic notion — the stars were 
for lovers. 

Loy had not seen harsh fact. To 
her all creation was designed for 
our pleasure and enjoyment. The 
most natural thing in her world 
was for a thoughtful government 
to provide us with a free honey- 
moon. The succession of chlorine 
worlds, dead rocks and gas giants 
we had discovered in the first six 
months of our Honeymoon Year 
had left her attitude largely un- 
touched — after all, we had each 
other. 

The most beautiful thing about 
Loy was that she could make me 
see things her way. 

So we were as children together 
on a summer Sunday in the park. 



64 



IF 




It was that kind of world, a world 
of low, broad-bladed grass, bril- 
liantly feathered birds, high blue 
sky, small six-legged rodents, ber- 
ry bushes, fruit trees. A happy, 
innocent Honeymoon World. 

You can see how sappy and 
wrapped up in each other we had 
become. No world is a park or a 
garden. The absence of a full 
spectrum of predators usually 
means that something sentient 
has wiped out the competition — 
so they told us in our briefings. 

Finally, after days of — I don’t 
know what else to call it but 
romping in the meadow — we de- 
cided on a little real exploring in 
the nearby woods. 

Loy was all for traveling as 
lightly as possible, taking only a 
sleeping bag and some concen- 
trates to supplement the local 
fruits and berries, which had 
proved edible and tasty. We had 
the closest thing we ever had to 
an argument when I insisted on 
taking energy rifles along. 

“It’s just not right, Bill,” she 
said, pouting and canting her 
blond head to one side at an en- 
gaging angle. “This planet has 
been so nice to us. It trusts us and 
it’s only right that we trust it. 
Carrying those ugly guns — it just 
isn’t right, it’s being, well, you 
know, nasty.” 

I tried to win the argument 
with a kiss but she turned sulkily 
away. 



“Look, honey,” I said, “we 
don’t know what’s in those woods. 
Things may be there that are 
nastier than we are. An energy 
rifle can stop an elephant. When 
it’s scary and gloomy in those 
woods, with strange night noises 
and things scuffling in the dark, 
you’ll be glad I insisted on bring- 
ing the rifles even if we never use 
them.” 

“But Bill—” 

“Look at it this way. If we don’t 
have the guns, we’ll have to be 
suspicious and cautious every time 
we hear a strange sound — we 
won’t be able to trust anything. 
But if we do have the guns we 
won’t have to be leary because an 
energy rifle can stop anything.” 
“Masculine logic.” 

She sighed, but the sound had a 
giggle behind it. I gave her a hug 
and we took the rifles. 

T HE woods were dark and 
dense with gnarled, thick- 
trunked trees and tightly inter- 
laced networks of leafy branches. 
But the undergrowth was very 
light, we saw no dangerous ani- 
mals and we made good time. By 
nightfall we had reached the base 
of the low, rolling hills. Loy 
cooked a meal of concentrates, 
topped off with local fruits and 
berries. We crawled into the sleep- 
ing bag early. After several hours 
of enjoying the cool woods and the 
night sounds and each other, we 



HEROES DIE BUT ONCE

drifted off into a pleasant sleep. 

At some time during the night, 
half in dream, half awake, I felt 
an odd pressure in my mind. The 
feeling was strange, but not really 
menacing. It was an awareness of 
an interest not my own, a cold, 
emotionless questing for knowl- 
edge rifling through my mind as 
if it were some encyclopedia. A 
questing, a questioning, a knowl- 
edge-vacuum, with no form, no 
flavor, no personality behind it. 

I lay motionless, my eyes 
closed, in that gray borderland 
between sleep and wakefulness, 
wondering whether or not I was 
dreaming and not really caring. 

Suddenly Loy screamed beside 
me. I was instantly wide awake, 
eyes open, and I saw them. 

Encircling our sleeping bag 
were ten monstrosities about the 
size of large dogs — bodies like 
great slimy slugs, supporting what 
appeared to be naked living 
brains, wet and pulsating, ten 
times the size of a human brain. 
The things had no arms, no legs, 
no tentacles, just ghastly brains 
on slimy slug bodies. 

Loy was clinging to me, shaking 
and sobbing. I reached instinc- 
tively for the energy rifle close by 
the sleeping bag. Something froze 
my arm, then the rest of me. I 
was paralyzed and now I was 
aware, dreadfully aware, of the 
alien presence in my mind. 

I felt it grope in my mind for 



words, memories of concepts,, pick, 
choose and form words in my 
mind. 

Who? From where? What? 

Dazed, numb, only partially in 
control of the inner workings of 
my own mind, I found myself 
forming mental answers to the 
mental questions. 

We’re humans from Earth, an- 
other world circling another star. 

Other intelligences, the pres- 
ence thought into my mind. Other 
races. Interesting. Possibilities of 
much new data. Knowledge-ex- 
pansion. Good. 

There was no emotion behind 
any of it, unless you consider an 
almost obscene lust for knowledge 
an emotion. A million angry ques- 
tions tried to form themselves in 
my mind. I felt the mental pres- 
ence beat them away with casual 
indifference. 

Different , the presence said, 
growing ever more facil^ with the 
borrowed words. You and the 
other are different from each oth- 
er. Your physical structures are 
not contributing to the same men- 
tal structure. Do separate races 
share your planet? 

I was in no mood to answer 
inane questions. Loy had gone 
quiet in my arms, as paralyzed as 
I was. I knew that she was still 
terrified, and I had to act, if only 
mentally, to remove the cause of 
her fear. But my mind was not my 
own. I felt my total mental re- 



66 



IF 




sources struggling to answer the 
alien’s questions, my entire stock 
of memories and mental capacities 
rise to do its bidding, to fill the 
yawning knowledge vacuum. 

I watched, almost as an outside 
observer, as my mind marshaled 
itself and answered. I found my- 
self explaining what I had never 
even stopped to consider: what it 
was to be a human being, the dif- 
ference between men and women, 
how Earth was inhabited by bil- 
lions of separate organic systems 
called men, whose mental struc- 
tures were distinct and separate 
from each other, billions of unique 
and separate mental universes 
arising from an equal number of 
physical organisms. 

I felt the alien presence in my 
mind boggle, almost stagger, un- 
willing to believe, yet unable to 
disbelieve. In that moment of con- 
fusion I felt the thing’s control 
over my mind waver for an in- 
stant, and I used that moment to 
shape my own confusion into a 
demand, a question. 

Who , what are you? 

Then I tried to reach for the 
energy rifle again and felt the 
presence resume its iron control. 

I sensed a securing hesitation 
in the thing, then reluctant de- 
cision. I felt words forming them- 
selves in my mind. 

Knowledge on your part may 
facilitate accumulation of data. 
I. .am. I do not think of my 



mental structure as “I." The pres- 
ence detected by your mental 
structure is that of the mental 
structure of this planet. This plan- 
et bears many species of organ- 
isms. The organisms you now see 
are one such species. They are so 
specialized that their separate 
physical structures give rise to one 
unified mental structure; that is, 
to what you think of as “me." 
These organisms have no other 
function but the erection of this 
mental structure. The mental 
structure thus erected may con- 
trol the physical structure of this 
planet, the sentient being, the in- 
telligent race. According to all 
previously accumulated data, I 
had hypothesized that I was the 
only such mental structure that 
existed, the only center of aware- 
ness in the universe. Now data is 
made available to the effect that 
at least one planet exists where 
billions of organisms give rise to 
billions of separate mental struc- 
tures, so that in effect your planet 
has several billion intelligent 
races. This promises a vast new 
area of knowledge and much data 
that may now be accumulated. 

It was my turn to boggle, to be 
unwilling to believe, yet unable — 
by the very nature of the contact 
— to disbelieve. An intelligent 
race, thousands, perhaps millions 
of individual organisms giving 
rise to but one mind. A mind 
alone, without companionship. 



HEROES DIE BUT ONCE

without love or hate or jealousy — 
without, I suddenly realized, the 
concept of death. Emotions, hopes, 
fear — which in the last analysis is 
always the fear of individual 
death — how could a mind alone 
know any of these? What could 
motivate such a mind, impel it to 
action? 

Suddenly, I felt myself virtually 
unable to think. The alien mind 
was dampening my thoughts with 
irresistible power. It seemed to 
rejoice, to loll in a kind of obscene 
anticipation. 

Such knowledge. Such a rich 
store of new data! Such a wealth 
of new possibilities to explore, ex- 
periments to perform! 

And I realized that only one 
thing could occupy such a mind: 
a quest for knowledge that was not 
abstract, not cold and intellectual, 
but raised to the level of a basic 
emotion — the basic emotion, a 
drive virtually sexual in its power 
and intensity. 

I felt Loy tense against me. I 
sensed her fear and shared it. We 
had no point of empathy with 
such a mind. This entity was 
asocial, hence amoral, to its very 
core. And we were totally in its 
power. 

Let us go, I said wordlessly to 
the world-mind. Let us go and 
well tell you all you want to 
know. When we return to Earth 
well send back scientists, men 
who specialize in knowledge. You 



can learn more from them than 
you ever can from us. 

Yes, that will be good. Later. 
After all possible data has been 
accumulated from you. Much is 
to be learned. It will take a long 
time to exhaust the possibilities. 
Especially concerning the pecu- 
liar states of mental structure you 
call emotions. And most particu- 
larly the emotion you call love. It 
seems to be the most powerful and 
the most important. But this oth- 
er . the one you call death — that 
will require much, much experi- 
mentation. 

A ND I remembered, now I re- 
membered all. How the alien 
mind had seized control of our 
bodies, how we had been trotted 
against our wills unerringly 
through the night to the system of 
caves in the hills, surrounded by 
the brain-slugs. How Loy had 
been separated from me in the 
caves. How I had been lying on 
the cave floor for an unknown 
length of time, somehow needing 
neither food nor water, feeling 
neither hunger nor thirst, totally 
controlled by the world-mind. 

I remembered the probing, the 
endless rifling of my mind for 
things of significance and things 
trivial until everything I had ever 
known, every memory 1 had ever 
had, matters I had thought I had 
forgotten or had never known I 
knew had been sucked from me 



68 



iF 




and greedily devoured by the 
knowledge-crazed mind. 

And then they had started in 
earnest the experiments, the end- 
less, horrible experiments. Pain, 
hunger, ecstasy, fear, lust, the 
whole spectrum of emotions and 
drives — the thing made me exper- 
ience them over and over again, 
while it hovered in my mind, ob- 
serving, clucking to itself, record- 
ing, evaluating, savoring. 

I remember asking again and 
again what was happening to Loy 
and finally, when the world-mind 
was good and ready, it let me 
know. Loy was conveyed into the 
chamber by a bevy of our cap- 
tors, her body thin and drawn 
and not her own. I was forced to 
watch, immobilized, while what 
had been done to me was done to 
her. 

I watched the pain and the fear 
and the lust play over her fea- 
tures, and i all the while I could 
feel the presence in my mind as- 
sessing my reactions, accumulat- 
ing the knowledge of how a man 
feels when he is watching his 
bride being tortured. 

Then the process was reversed 
and Loy was forced to look on 
while the world-mind did things to 
me. 

Finally the thing was satisfied. 

Most interesting , the words in 
my mind said. Although your two 
mental structures are separate en- 



tities , there seems to be some in- 
teraction between them. If one of 
you undergoes unpleasant stimuli 
both of you react. It is as if your 
mental structures were partially 
connected.' This seems to be at 
least the major part of the phe- 
nomenon you call love. Interest- 
ing. Love would seem to be one of 
the two strongest aberrations 
called emotion to which your men- 
tal structures are prone. One may 
consider it one pole of your emo- 
tional spectrum. The other pole 
seems to be a fear of this phenom- 
enon you call death. That will 
have to be investigated most 
thoroughly. 

Loy had been led out and I 
died for the first time. 

Now I truly remembered every- 
thing. This was not the first time 
I had died and been reborn. How 
many times had I died? I had no 
way of knowing. Each death had 
been real — a death without mem- 
ory of the earlier ones. Each time 
had somehow been the one and 
only time, all-obliterating death 
itself, and — 

Very good , the presence in my 
mind said. You have died one 
hundred and seventy-three times. 
Much data has been gathered, 
much has been understood. This 
death is the worst possible thing 
that can happen to you, the per- 
manent destruction of your men- 
tal structure. You now understand 
death totally. You know in detail 



heroes die but once 



69 




just what it is to die. Nothing that 
you can experience is more un- 
pleasant. The same reaction was 
observed in all the woman s deaths 
as well. 

I cried aloud, " You filthy — " 

It cut me off impatiently, the 
brain-things pulsing and squirm- 
ing in the pale blue light. 

It was necessary that she under- 
go the same experiences, both as a 
control and as a condition of the 
final exp erim en t. 

In my mind I responded fear- 
fully. Final experiment? 

Yes. All possible data has been 
accumulated, except for one most 
interesting experiment. It has 
been established that one pole of 
your emotional spectrum is love. 
The other is fear of death. It but 
remains to determine which is 
stronger. At the conclusion of this 
experiment, one of you will be per- 
mitted to return to your own 
planet. 

I gasped. One of us? 

Of necessity, the presence said. 
The purpose of this final experi- 
ment is to determine which is the 
stronger stimulus: love or death. 
You will both undergo the experi- 
ence of death one final time. This 
time you will be permitted to re- 
tain the memories of all your pre- 
vious deaths as you die. But this 
time you will really die. You will 
not awaken from this death. Each 
of you will have only one way of 
saving yourself — you must sacri- 



fice the other. You have only to 
declare in your mind that you 
wish the other to die in your place 
and it shall be done. Then you 
will be allowed to return to your 
planet. It should be a most in- 
formative experiment. 

And once again I felt the black- 
ness closing in, numbness over- 
whelming my extremities, my 
body sloughing away from me. I 
felt myself sinking slowly but in- 
exorably into nothingness. 

But this time the terror was 
even greater, for now I remem- 
bered this happening before, 
again and again and again. As 
each tiny fraction of my universe 
was chipped away, I was antici- 
pating, knowing how it would be, 
fearing it an instant before it 
came, out of my deep knowledge 
of exactly what it was really to 
die. And I knew that Loy was 
feeling it, too. 

I felt my consciousness collaps- 
ing upon itself, contracting, fad- 
ing to a point and every moment 
I was anticipating the next, dying 
a thousand deaths in one. 

Inward, ever inward, the 
screaming animal thing that was 
me contracted, faded, beating 
hopelessly against that final, in- 
finitely anticipated oblivion. And 
Loy was dying, too. 

I was reduced to a mote of con- 
sciousness, a thing in itself, by it- 
self. A thing fading, shrinking — 
and all around was the night, 



70 



IF 




the consuming, endless night. The 
end of me-ness, of hope and fear 
and pain and love. Of all I ever 
was, ever would be. 

And Loy was dying, too. The 
words were a constant refrain. No 
amount of bravery could save her. 
I could not save her. Nothing, no 
one could. We were both dying 
and only one of us could live, the 
one wtio doomed the other. 

I was no longer a man, no long- 
er a husband, no longer a lover. I 
was a thing, a mewling, screaming, 
panicked thing, a thing that had 
died and died and died and re- 
membered every moment of those 
multiple deaths. 

I was a dying thing, an ego hun- 
gering for another instant of life 
and the black was closing in. 

And then there was nothing left 
of me but a howling maddened 
voice shrieking against the night — 
no! 

Screaming and begging, hold- 
ing on to each instant like a man 
hanging irom a cliff by his fingers, 
each moment a little more of the 
edge crumbling beneath his fin- 
gernails. 

And Loy was dying, too. I could 
not save her. I could only save 
me. And suddenly love was a far- 
away thing of another world, 
another plane of existence. There 
was no love. There was no Loy. 
Only me. And soon there would 
be an end to me and there would 
be nothing, nothing, nothing, 



howling and empty and everything 
lost to me forever. 

And before I had decided any- 
thing, before I realized what I was 
doing, I was screaming: “Her. 
Kill her. Not me. Not me. Her. 
Her. Her.” 

A presence far away said sim- 
ply, You shall live. 

The blackness closed in but I 
was no longer afraid. 

I AWOKE in the meadow next 
to the ship. Two of the brain- 
slugs stood beside me. 

In front of me stood Loy. She 
was staring intently at the ground. 

Interesting , said the world- 
mind. The experiment is con- 
cluded, and the results are as an- 
ticipated. It was, of course , not 
necessary that either of you actu- 
ally die. You are free to leave. 

The two brain-slugs began to 
wriggle swiftly away toward the 
hills, leaving twin trails «of trans- 
lucent slime in the grass. 

Loy and I stood for long mo- 
ments not speaking, not able to 
look at each other. Finally, after 
what seemed an eternity, our eyes 
met for the briefest instant. 

But I knew from that flicker of 
a moment that all that had ever 
been between us was dead and 
gone forever. I only needed that 
momentary glance into her eyes 
to know with terrible certainty 
that Loy had made the same 
choice I had. • 



HEROES DIE BUT ONCE 



71 




THE 

NEW 

THING 

JOHN BRUNNER 

The most dangerous question in the 
Universe may be — What's new? 

T O WALK across the great 
hall of the Record Registry 
was to feel one plodded through 
deep dust, although the floor was 
spotless, clean and firm underfoot. 
A hard heel could make it ring 
but so vast was the hall that 
echoes died on the way to the walls 
and roof which might have re- 
flected them. 

That which lay here deep and 
made the going heavy was de- 
spair. 

At certain points on the wall, at 
about the height of a man, red fig- 
ures shone: a one, a zero, a three, 
a nine and a four. Last year the 
group had ended in a three. Next 
year it would most likely end in a 
five. Below, above, on every side 
was a feeling of pressure, a sense 
that the air was being made to 
shimmer — from this shimmering 
sifted down the intangible motes 
of hopelessness that settled not on 
the bodies but on the minds of 
those who came here. 



73 




The weight of those particles 
which were without weight was 
graphed by apathy: less laughing, 
more anger; less anger, more sigh- 
ing; less sighing, more silence. 

This was the Record Registry in 
which had been stored data about 
the achievements of every intelli- 
gent race known to have inhabited 
this galaxy: the Frotuglize, the 
Zyphrians, the Homoclawk, the 
Madgerive — facts garnered from 
more than a million worlds to 
serve as a yardstick for the cur- 
rent precariously dominant spe- 
cies, the oxygen-breathing biped 
known as Man. 

This was the place to which 
proud spokesmen from thousands 
of the planets that Man now oc- 
cupied had come, anxious to 
have their accomplishments also 
marked in the imperishable pat- 
tern of the computer memories as 
Records: the FIRST time such- 
and-such was done THESE were 
they who did it. > 

This was the Ultimate Arbiter: 
the passionless machine that ate 
the energy of the stars for food 
and stored the knowledge of the 
galaxy for — satisfaction? 

Here, now, hoping against hope 
that the long, long time they 
waited for a verdict on the offer- 
ings they had brought — the pan- 
sensory tapes, the certified time 
marks, the attestations and docu- 
mentary evidence and other 
things by the shipload — indicated 



that they would finally secure a 
place in the Record list and cause 
the figures on the wall to revert 
to zero, were four isolated indi- 
viduals, two women and two men. 
By turns, each watching for one- 
third of a standard day, they mon- 
itored display panels set into the 
wall upon which the verdicts must 
eventually appear. 

By custom those who had been 
here longest waited farthest from 
the entrance. By custom, also, one 
did not speak of the hoped-for 
record-breaking accomplishment 
that had caused the people of a 
whole faraway planet to send its 
delegates to the Registry. All too 
easily two delegations might have 
come here to post an identical 
claim. That suspicion was haunt- 
ing, inescapable; drawn apart, the 
four no longer spoke excitedly to 
one another but remained quiet 
and revolved in their minds the 
terrifying possibility of null 
achievements. 

As the red-glowing, figures 
showed, it was ten thousand three 
hundred and ninety-four years 
since a new Record had been en- 
tered on the list. 

W HEN the fifth arrival ap- 
peared in the enormous 
doorway the soft, directionless 
voice of the automatic enunciator 
caused those who were already 
waiting to turn incuriously and 
look that way, but only the newest 



74 



IF 




of the former arrivals retained 
enough spirit to raise a glass and 
inspect him at a distance. The 
others were content to wait — he 
would, by custom, come to them. 
More than likely he would bring a 
breath of intolerable excitement 
with him and be bewildered by 
their dullness. And it would be too 
great an effort to explain the rea- 
son. 

The glass showed, in fine long- 
range detail, a very old man in- 
deed, his brown skin networked 
with lines, his scalp showing 
through the scattered white hairs 
that crossed it, his back bent, his 
scrawny arm requiring the support 
not of an automated walker but 
of a simple staff. His only visible 
garment was a long gray robe that 
brushed the insteps of feet aged 
nearly to translucency. 

Breathing with some effort, he 
leaned on his staff and gazed 
across the hall for a long moment, 
his eyes at least suggesting alert- 
ness and vivacity. During that 
time the voice of the machine that 
enclosed them all stated some sim- 
ple facts about him. 

“The newcomer wishes to be 
known as Alexander. He is a hu- 
man male of the genetic strain 
qBA. He is aged one thousand 
one hundred and sixty-four and 
his planet of origin is Earth. Of 
the Records in the current list 
held by human beings twenty-two 
per cent were established on — or 



by citizens of — Earth, more than 
any other single planet. But the 
last one hundred applications for 
new Records by citizens of Earth 
have all been adjudged unaccept- 
able.” 

At the startling figure of twen- 
ty-two per cent the four who were 
already present turned in unison 
to stare at Alexander. At the con- 
clusion of the machine’s remarks, 
they uttered simultaneous sighs of 
relief. Nothing — nothing in the 
universe — could conceivably be 
more galling than to assist at the 
Registration of someone else’s 
Record, while having one’s own 
rejected. 

There was a moment of renewed 
silence. At the end of it Alexander 
gathered his failing strength and 
began to walk. 

B Y CUSTOM he went first to 
speak with the man who 
waited farthest from the door. 
This was a hulking fellow in a 
tight garb of dark green. His 
beard hung untrimmed to his 
waist and his fingernails were 
overgrown and chipped. 

In a thin voice and a polite 
manner the old man said, “As you 
have been told, I am Alexander 
and I come from Earth.” 

The hulking man moved only 
his eyes. The slumped weight of 
his body remained inert on the 
folding metal chair that supported 
him. It was not until it became 



THE NEWTHING 



75 




clear that the intrusive stranger 
was patient and did not plan to go 
away of his own immediate ac- 
cord that he summoned enough 
energy to grunt a harsh response. 

“I’m Cridge, from Balkistan. 
Anything else you want to know 
or will you leave me in peace?” 

“Thank you,” said Alexander 
sadly and moved to speak to the 
next in line. 

This was a woman, a very stout 
one, whose gross body matched 
the inflatable armchair under her, 
and who leaned one elbow on the 
side of the chair so that her fin- 
gers were conveniently located to 
pluck at her underlip — brrup, 
brrup, brrup. She wore no cloth- 
ing at all but nudity was custom- 
ary on many worlds. 

Alexander addressed her in the 
same words and after a long- 
drawn-out sigh she consented to 
reply. 

“I’m Gailalu and I come from 
Ludgerworld. Welcome to the 
Registry. And now, if you don’t 
mind, I’d like to go on watching 
my panel. I’m expecting a verdict 
any moment.” 

Alexander inclined his head and 
moved on toward the third of 
those waiting — again a man but 
this time one of middle age and 
medium build, with the contrast 
of dark skin, pale hair and a body- 
harness of flexible gold that lo- 
cated his ancestry to within a few 
hundred parsecs. While on the 



verge of approaching this man’s 
nullgravity couch and a third time 
uttering his introduction, Alexan- 
der checked, glancing toward the 
door. A man had appeared there, 
young and vigorous of stride, in 
gaudy yellow and blue, and at the 
sight of him the fourth person 
waiting — a girl with a bright smile 
and a sweep of clear red hair — 
had jumped up in delight and 
gone running to meet him. 

His eyes following the girl, 
Alexander spoke to the dark- 
skinned, pale-haired man and re- 
ceived much the answer he had 
been expecting. 

“I’m Phraticor and I come 
from Loghious. You’re from 
Earth, are you? Well, I wish you 
as much luck with your applica- 
tion as I’m having with mine— 
I’ve been here three months al- 
ready. Obviously it’s taking a lot 
of time to process our Loghian 
data. But the chances are that 
when the breakthrough comes 
it’ll be sudden — so I’d better not 
waste time chatting right now. 
Later, maybe.” 

And with that his mask of civil- 
ity gave way to the same expres- 
sion his companions wore. 

A lexander made to move 

on. But before he had covered 
the distance that separated him 
from the stool on which the girl 
had been keeping her watch, she 
had brought the newcomer to 



76 



IF 




meet him, her arm linked with 
his. 

“Hugo, this is Alexander and 
he’s from Earth — can you ima- 
gine it?” she exclaimed. “The 
world we all started on thousands 
of centuries ago! I’m Doha, by 
the way,” she added to Alexan- 
der. “And Hugo, of course, is my 
relief. He came for me early so 
we could have time together.” 

She gave the arm she held an 
affectionate squeeze. 

Alexander looked at them for a 
long time. At last a smile crossed 
his face, so that one might have 
imagined his dry old skin crack- 
ling like ancient parchment. 

He said, “I see you are very 
happy with one another.” 

Hugo nodded and gave an an- 
swering smile that turned his fea- 
tures from regular to handsome. 

“And you are from what 
world?” Alexander pursued. 

“Oh, from Coraline.” Doha 
shrugged. She gave her words an 
embarrassed inflection. “A very 
new world — you probably won’t 
have heard of it. This is our first 
application to the Registry and 
we’re terribly excited. Everyone 
seems to think we have a very 
good chance because it’s taking so 
long to process our evidence. Usu- 
ally the first time a new world 
sends a delegation here it’s turned 
down right away. But we’ve been 
here over a month and they’re 
still processing.” 



“You mean it’s still process- 
ing,” Hugo corrected her gently. 
“This place isn’t run by people — 
it’s all machines.” 

“Slip of the tongue,” Doha said 
with a grimace. “Oh, we’re hold- 
ing up Alexander from posting 
his evidence, aren’t we? I’m sure 
you must be very eager to get on 
with it.” She checked and a tiny 
frown drew her brows together. 
Uncertainly she added: “Are you 
the entire delegation from Earth, 
by the way? Or are there others to 
follow?” 

“Good point.” Hugo nodded. 
“There are only five of us from 
Coraline but we’re still very un- 
derpopulated. I know the Loghi- 
ans sent sixty — and I don’t think 
I’ve managed to count the dele- 
gations from Ludgerworld and 
’Balkistan.” 

“I’m by myself,” Alexander 
said. 

Doha gasped. 

“But aren’t you going to find it 
terribly tiring — having to watch 
the screens all the time on your 
own? Or have you brought enough 
equipment to let you stay here all 
the time? Even so — ” 

She broke off doubtfully. 

“You were perhaps going to 
say,” Alexander supplemented, 
“that it will be a long and tiring 
wait nonetheless? Ah, there you’re 
wrong, though I appreciate your 
concern for my well-being. You 
see, I shall not have to wait. I 



THE NEW THING 



77 




know that I’m going to set an in- 
contestable Record.” 

The ensuing silence was not 
surprised but stunned. It was 
broken by the sound of movement 
from behind Alexander. He 
turned to see that his three other 
listeners had stirred from their 
dull postures of waiting and were 
gazing at him with dismay. Phrat- 
icor, the nearest, responded first, 
jumping to his feet with a display 
of bluster. 

“You say you know you’ll set a 
Record? Then you’re mad. You 
need medication, sedation, psy- 
chotherapy. Yours is a delusion 
of grandeur.” 

Hauling her ponderous mass to 
the floor, waddling toward Alex- 
ander with a furious scowl, the 
woman Gailalu chimed in to sup- 
port Phraticor. 

“Yes — yes. You have to submit 
your evidence to the machines. 
They compare your claim with all 
the billions and trillions of bits of 
data they have in store. No one 
can claim to predict a Record.” 

And, disturbed at last from his 
apathy, the hulking Cridge also 
strode over shouting, “You’re 
mad! You have to be mad! If any 
man can say what’s a Record — 
and what’s not — there’s no point 
in coming here, no point in wait- 
ing all these months and years 
for a verdict.” 

“Do you want your verdict, 
then?” Alexander said and drew 



his scrawny body up with the 
help of his staff, so that sudden 
authority rang in his voice like a 
brazen bell. 

“What?” Taken aback, Cridge 
stumbletongued. Then he re- 
torted, “Of course I want my 
verdict. Why else should I have 
sat here day by day for all these 
unendurable months?” 

“Because you found the wait- 
ing more endurable than the ver- 
dict,” Alexander answered. “The 
circuits of the Registry work at 
the speed of light. The verdict on 
any application may be had be- 
tween one heartbeat and the 
next.” 

“What?” Hugo stepped for- 
ward. “You mean we didn’t have 
to come here and waste all this 
Time — you mean we could have 
just come and gone home again?” 
“Would you rather be home 
again?” Alexander countered. 

“Of course! Do you think it’s 
any fun for Doha and me to be 
cooped here on this sterile arti- 
ficial planet with the dreary com- 
pany we have to keep — always 
being told to go sit here in this 
horrible hall for hours of every 
day — when we could be at home 
swimming and dancing and being 
happy together?” 

Beside him, in answer to an un- 
spoken question from Alexander, 
Dolia gave a firm nod. 

“It is as I feared,” Alexander 
said and the whole weight of his 



78 



IF 




years seemed to settle on his 
shoulders in a moment, so that he 
had to take a grip on his staff with 
both hands. 

But the others had exchanged 
glances in the meantime and, with 
acid formality, Cridge had de- 
cided to live up to his declared 
pretensions. 

He said, “I defy you to prove 
your assertion, sir. I think you’re 
lying — and when I’ve shown that 
you are I think I shall have you 
expelled from the Registry. This 
place is the repository of the 
known achievements of intelligent 
life in this galaxy and as such it 
might well be termed sacred. It is 
not to be mocked.” 

“Oh, for — ” Alexander ended 
his exclamation with a sound 
epitomizing disgust. “Have your 
verdict, then, before you rot into 
the floor.” 

H E BRUSHED Cridge aside 
and raised his staff to tap on 
the nearest of the uncountable 
wall-panels that displayed ver- 
dicts concerning applications for 
a new Record. 

“What do the people of Balki- 
stan think they’ve done that’s 
new?” he demanded — and his 
voice faded into a wheeze on the 
last word as though to suggest 
that the very concept of newness 
must be dead by now. 

“The people of Balkistan have 
reorganized their society so that 



novelty is illegal,” said the auto- 
matic voice from the air. The 
wall-panel simultaneously dis- 
played the words. “They claim 
that this is in itself unprece- 
dented.” 

“Have we gone that far?” 
Alexander whispered, while not- 
ing that all the other listeners — 
even Doha and Hugo — had re- 
laxed perceptibly. 

Evidently they are claiming a 
different Record or Records. 

“And?” 

“This had already been done 
by the following species: the 

Zyphrians, the Homoclawk, the 
Madgerive, the — ” 

“Stop,” Alexander said. And 
with reluctance added: “Dead 

species?” 

“All of them,” replied the ma- 
chine. 

He saw that Doha was turning 
pale and wondered whether she 
had insight into the terrible sus- 
picion he h^dju^t heard made a 
certainty. But he had no time for 
speculation. Now the die was 
cast and he had to hurry. 

“Balkistan has its verdict,” he 
told Cridge, “and could have had 
it within an hour of your arrival. 
Are you pleased with what you’ve 
heard?” 

“It must be a lie,” Cridge said 
uncertainly and was interrupted 
by Gailalu. 

“Of course it’s not a lie! Some- 
thing as stupid and obvious as 



THE NEWTHING

that was bound to have been done 
already. I’m prepared to hear the 
verdict on our achievement right 
away, if you can honestly make it 
come out of the machine.” 

“You doubt me?” Alexander 
said. “No, not me but those who 
were faint of heart before you. 
Little by little, ten thousand 
years ago, people grew discour- 
aged by the negative verdicts that 
kept coming out of the machine, 
one, ten, a hundred, a thousand. 
There is something missing from 
the air of this place — without 
which no human being can sur- 
vive.” 

“You’re crazy. We were told 
the place was — ” 

“I don’t mean oxygen,” said 
Alexander. “What I’m talking 
about is hope.” 

And, not giving Gailalu time 
for a reply, he asked the machine 
to utter its verdict on the applica- 
tion from Ludgerworld. 

“The population of that planet 
have turned it inside out,” re- 
ported the machine. “Now they 
live on its interior and the hot 
core is a tiny artificial sun.” 

Hearing the words, Gailalu 
drew herself up proudly and 
sneered at the others. 

“There’s an unprecedented feat 
for you!” she cried. 

“The Record in this respect is 
held by the Frotuglize,” said the 
impersonal machine. “They 
turned the second planet of 198C- 



Avgrid/H inside out approximate- 
ly thirty thousand years ago.” 

“They, too, shut out the uni- 
verse,” said Alexander. “And 
went their private way to death. 
Well, Phraticor?” 

The dark man, with a glance at 
Gailalu, whose face had taken on 
the emotionless expression of 
someone who has survived an 
earthquake but lost in it both 
family and friends, said chal- 
lengingly, “There’s no need to ask 
the machines what we have done. 
We made a star — yes! From the 
separate atoms of hydrogen drift- 
ing in nothingness we pulled to- 
gether mass enough to make it 
glow, a new light in the pattern of 
the heavens!” 

Doha and Hugo, as one, drew 
in their breath in wonder, but 
Alexander shook his aged head. 

“Poor Phracticor,” he said. 
“Poor people on an isolated 
world. Machine, tell them the 
truth and end their misery.” 

“What misery?” barked Phrat- 
icor. 

But the machine had already 
begun to speak. 

“The majority of the Popula- 
tion I stars in the galaxy are now 
known to be the products of an 
unnamed race of approximately 
nine hundred and fifty million 
years ago, whose factory was re- 
sponsible for clearing the volume 
between our galaxy and the Great- 
er Magellanic Cloud of all hydro-

IF 




gen, totaling approximately — ” 
“Stop,” Alexander directed 
and the machine fell silent. The 
face of Phraticor had turned 
gray. 

“But — ” Doha spoke after a 
terrible struggle with herself. “But 
I thought the Zyphrians — ” 

“Were the first race we have 
any knowledge of?” Alexander 
sighed. “No, alas, my dear. Only 
the first race whose achievements 
we have so far matched — or ra- 
ther, had matched. To outdo the 
Starmakers we should have to 
build a galaxy — and the raw ma- 
terials for that do not exist any- 
where in the plenum.” With a wry 
moue he added, “Anyway, where 
would you put it?” 

Recovering slowly from his 
shock, Hugo said, “In that case 
— I think it best not to even men- 
tion our own petty little applica- 
tion. If the creation of a star 
turns out to be the pointless re- 
enactment of some previous 
Record we might as well quit and 
go home.” 

Doha nodded and they turned 
toward the door. 

“Wait.” The order came from 
Cridge, whose despair had given 
way to rage on digesting the fact 
that his own world’s boasted 
achievement was likewise the 
mere shadow of something long 
ago. “Not so fast. Are we 'to be 
cowed by this — this intruder, this 
lunatic? Didn’t you hear him say 



that he was certain of establishing 
a new Record? I want to know 
what the people of Earth can do 
that’s so superior, so novel and so 
fantastic that it’ll be accepted 
here.” 

“Yes!” Gailalu cried. 

“Yes!” Phraticor agreed, 
marching threateningly close to 
the old man. 

D OLIA was tugging Hugo 
away but he resisted and 
spoke over the girl’s bright red 
casque of hair. 

“Sir, I think you owe us that, 
at least. If you do not prove what 
you claim we shall have no 
grounds to believe you on any 
score. I always understood that to 
secure a verdict from the Registry 
the applicant might have to wait 
for weeks, months, even years.” 
“Fair,” conceded Alexander. 
He repeated more softly, “Fair — ” 
He grew brisk, “Well, then, 
since doubtless it will be you who 
by chance are elected to convey 
news of this event to the rest of 
the galaxy — and to do so you’ll 
need all the data you can get — I 
suggest that we begin in inquiring 
what the last Record was that was 
set by the people of Earth. Ma- 
chine, enlighten my friends on 
that score, please.” 

“The largest information-pro- 
cessing system in the galaxy,” 
said the mechanical voice, “the 
Record Registry, was set up by 



THE NEW THING 



81 




the people of Earth approximately 
thirteen thousand two hundred 
years ago. No known previous 
and no subsequent installation of 
the kind outdoes it for (a) storage 
capacity, (b) speed of response, 

(c)-” 

“Stop,” said Alexander. And, 
turning to Doha, added: “You 
have a question?” 

“Yes!” She was almost weep- 
ing and her nails were dug deep 
into her palms. “If it’s supposed 
to be so fast, why have people 
had to come here and sit around, 
wait months for a verdict, come 
here day after day after day?” 

“Not because of the machine.” 
Alexander sighed. “But because 
of their own reluctance to face the 
kind of truth that led us, the peo- 
ple of Earth, to create the Regis- 
try in the first place. You see, 
Earth is — uh — was a very old 
world. There had been men on it, 
naturally, who spoke and used 
tools and fire and ^re after a 
fashion intelligent, for perhaps as 
long as two million years before 
the dawn of the age of Space and 
the colonization of all your other 
planets. We had time to relax, sit 
back, meditate, hear the news, 
while you on Loghious and 
Balkistan and Coraline and all 
the other planets of other stars 
were busy getting on with your 
lives, taming strange environ- 
ments, adapting to new foods, 
learning to love new mountains 



and new oceans. You do love your 
worlds, don’t you?” 

He glanced at the others, who 
had grouped before him in a semi- 
circle. Dolia finally answered him 
with a nod and a smile. 

“As I expected,” Alexander 
muttered. “You from the young- 
est world find it easiest to reply. 
So I must ask your forgiveness 
for our disastrous mistake be- 
cause there is no one else to ask it 
of and no one else to do the ask- 
ing. 

“It seemed to us — as we saw 
the people of Earth grow less en- 
terprising, ambitious, adventur- 
ous; more complacent, contented, 
repetitious in their lives — that 
something had to be done to jolt 
the species out of such a rut. This 
is what we did — we created this 
Registry, where the achievements 
of every species that to our knowl- 
edge preceded us are recorded. It 
was intended to act as a perqnnial 
spur, as a creative force to, pose 
new goals and new ambitions for 
Mankind. We did not know of the 
Starmakers when we designed 
and built the Registry — had we 
known, perhaps our decision 
would have been otherwise. 

“¥jI7ELL, for a little time it 

▼ ▼ worked. As we had antici- 
pated, men came from all over 
the galaxy to inform the ma- 
chines of new accomplishments 
and the tidings spread rapidly 



82 



IF 




when some great breakthrough 
was accomplished. To spur men* 
on still further, we made sure that 
anything that was a copy of the 
work of other species was dis- 
missed as such. But this was a 
terrible horror — and, I confess, it 
stemmed from arrogance. What 
business had we — who a mere 
two million-odd years ago were 
grunting in caves and killing our 
fellows to suck the marrow from 
their bones — to match attainments 
with races who lasted as many 
years in space alone, who — as we 
belatedly discovered — were capa- 
ble of shaping the very galaxy we 
inhabit to suit their tastes? 

“You, friend from Loghious 
who built a star! Your feat was 
marvelous, fantastic, incredible. I 
salute you — were it not that these 
old bones are stiff and slow, I’d 
go down on my knees to kiss your 
sandal strap! And you from Ludg- 
erworld who turned it inside out, 
who made your own small sun to 
suit your needs — you, too, I ad- 
mire and salute, for you saw a 
peak of accomplishment and 
with single-minded determination 
scaled it!” 

Now the old man’s voice was 
ringing so loudly it could almost 
call echoes from the far-distant 
walls of the great hall. He had 
forgotten his age and the prop of 
his staff in his excess of pride at 
the successes of the species he be- 
longed to. 



“From you and your people, 
Cridge, I can, however, do no 
more than beg forgiveness. We 
unwittingly sent you down the 
blind alley in which you became 
lost — and not only you but every- 
one who has visited this hall for 
the past ten millennia.” 

Alexander’s staff made a con- 
temptuous jab at the red-glowing 
figures on the wall. 

“We turned what should have 
been a challenge into a foregone 
conclusion. It has been be- 
lieved for thousands of years that 
anyone who came here to apply 
for the listing of a Record was 
bound to have it rejected — and so 
the custom has grown up of not 
asking for the verdict until all 
patience has run out, until the 
weight of boredom and despera- 
tion becomes intolerable. Once 
hundreds of planets every year 
sent eager delegations to the 
Registry — and now, in this hall 
that could hold a thousand, I find 
only you people waiting. Oh, it’s 
sad, it’s sad . 

“So, as a result, on thousands 
of human worlds life grows drab, 
pointless, monotonous. For every- 
thing that one can think of to do 
has already been done and the un- 
questionable authority of the Rec- 
ord Registry says it’s been done. 
And in the end . .” He drew a 
deep breath and clutched his staff 
tightly to him. “Yes! In the end. 

“Friends, I know you hate me. 



THE NEW THING 



83 




Why should you not? I come here, 
I tell you why your hoped-for 
Records are a waste of time. I 
claim to be about to register a 
Record of my own — certainly you 
must hate me. I see you shake 
your head, Doha, and I’m grate- 
ful. But that’s because you’re 
young, and you have your man 
beside you — and you’ve not yet 
been disappointed often enough 
to become cynical about those 
good things which are, after all, 
the real prizes of life. I under- 
stand and respect, I even accept, 
your detestation. I shall make it 
worse. I shall say that I am 
about to post two Records — and 
that in itself will be a third. Ma- 
chine! Has any delegation from 
any planet registered two Records 
on a single visit?” 

“No,” said the voice from the 
air. 

“I thought not. Well, then, let 
me deal with the first. Machine, 
what is the planet which has been 
longest inhabited by mankind and 
is now uninhabited?” 

“The planet Earth,” said the 
machine. 

T HE silence this time was ter- 
rible — a silence like the im- 
placable noiselessness between 
the galaxies. 

At last Hugo said faintly, 
“Earth is — ” 

“Earth is empty,” said Alexan- 
der. “The reason for that is what 



you’ve witnessed here. You, 
Cridge. Tell us what went on in 
your mind while you were sitting 
here waiting for the verdict.” 

“I — ” The hulking man had to 
swallow. “I suppose I thought 
about what we would do to exceed 
our own Record — if one were 
granted to us — and I couldn’t 
think of anything.” 

“And to postpone your con- 
frontation with that terrifying 
knowledge, the realization that 
you had nothing left to work for, 
no ambition, no plans, hopes, 
schemes, you waited here. You 
sat and stared at a blank wall 
panel and put off the moment of 
truth. Am I not right?” 

Cridge nodded. 

“You, too, Doha, and your 
man Hugo — you’d have suffered 
that fate,” Alexander sighed. “Al- 
ready, by accepting the idea that 
one must wait for the machines 
instead of coming right out and 
asking for their verdict, you’d 
taken the first step toward catas- 
trophe. I wouldn’t wish that 
doom on you, young, lively, vital 
— it was dreadful enough seeing 
it overtake the tired, bone-weary 
folk of Earth. First one wondered: 
why have children since their lives 
will be a mere repetition of other 
lives? Then it was: why marry, 
why choose a lover, if a billion 
others have already done the 
same? And at last it was: why 
live? 



84 



IF 




“I alone survive to register my 
Records. You already know the 
third one. Before naming my 
first, I must give you instructions. 
I must tell you to go and rouse 
your companions. Order them to 
go back aboard their ships and to 
leave the Registry. And tell them 
not to go home at once — but to 
orbit a million miles out in order 
to warn other ships not to ap- 
proach closer than that.” 

“What?” Cridge’s normal hec- 
toring manner seemed to be re- 
turning by the second now that he 
was free of the weight of hopeless- 
ness that pervaded the Registry. 
“Why must we keep everyone else 
away? For all we know a new 
Record could be established by 
the next visitors!” 

“Your thinking belongs to the 
past,” Alexander said sadly, rais- 
ing his staff before his face. He 
gave the ends a twist and lowered 
it again. “My first Record has 
been iet. The machines here are 
very perceptive — why don’t you 
ask them just what that Record 
is? You know, don’t you?” .he 
asked the air. 

“The person who wishes to be 
known as Alexander,” said the 
machine, “is the first visitor who 
ever brought to the Registry with- 
out being detected a bomb of suf- 
ficient power to destroy it.” 

Cridge, Gailalu and Phraticor 
exclaimed in horror and instantly 
took to their heels. Hugo would 

THE NEWTHING 



have done the same but Dolia 
clung to him and made him wait. 
She asked, “Is it true?” 

Her voice trembled. 

“Quite true.” Alexander sat 
down on her stool and with one 
thin hand caressed the staff ab- 
sently. “I should hurry if I were 
you. You have only an hour to 
get away.” 

“But you — ” 

“I have nothing to get away 
for.” Alexander shrugged. “A 
thousand years has been enough 
for me.” 

“Dolia, come on,” Hugo cried. 
“He’s crazy — dangerous, too.” 
“No^ he’s not_ crazy,” Dolia 
said. “Just sad. Will there be an- 
other Registry?” 

“In a million years, perhaps,” 
Alexander promised. “By then 
we should have enough Records 
of our own. For the time being, 
though, isn’t it better to do what 
one wants to do — without worry- 
ing about whether or not it’s al- 
ready been! done?” 

“I’m young enough to remem- 
ber what it was like the first time 
I — ” Dolia checked, glanced at 
Hugo and colored. “Well, the 
first time, anyway.” 

“In that case,” Alexander said, 
“you are unusually wise. Remem- 
ber that to be wise is a very pre- 
cious thing.” 

“I’ll try,” she whispered. She 
put out her hand uncertainly,

THE 

BEGINNING 

i GLENN CHANG 



Glenn Chang, at J8 , isJalre 
National Merit Fin 
High School, Hawaii, he entered Northwestern 
University this fall — on a scholarship — to major 
in chemistry. Already a veteran of survival by his 
own admission, Glenn has written — for his IF 
First — a story of survival. And creation. 




W HEN the time came they 
both realized the implica- 
tions. 

“Dissolution,” he said. 

“Yes,” she replied. 

They looked into each other’s 
eyes. 

“I do not want this.” He stated 
it flatly. 

“Nor I,” she breathed quickly. 
“Oh, my love, can’t we go on 
even for a little while longer?” 

He shook his head. “No, impos- 
sible. I am old and the law must 
be obeyed.” 



oqfcj.n 

“We are both old.” Her tone 
was dull and resigned. 

He leaned forward and clasped 
her hands tightly in his. “Yes, 
that is true. We are old. But we 
have lived — and we have lived to- 
gether. And I — I remember.” He 
looked deep into her eyes and 
saw longing there. “I remember 
when I first saw you and realized 
that I loved you. I remember the 
quiet walks we took, the chil- 
dren’s games we played, all the 
joys and sorrows we shared. I 
know the beauty of your soul, the 



gentleness and the deep sensitiv- 
ity of your manner. That is the es- 
sence of you, my darling, that I 
have loved all these long ages of 
existence.” 

“And I love you, too,” she said 
tremblingly, eyes bright. 

For a space the two bowed fig- 
ures sat facing each other, seem- 
ingly oblivious of their fate — to 
have their ancient, decrepit 
bodies Dissolved, the chemicals 
and particles transformed into 
pure energy, their existence 
snuffed out. 

The two last humans in the uni- 
verse. 

Suddenly his head snapped up. 
She looked at him, startled, and 
then, noting his expression, hope- 
fully. 

“We cannot ask the Machine 
for continuance,” he began, “for 
our ruler’s word is irreversible. 
Yet possibly — yes — I believe I 
have thought of another way — ” 

He took her hands again and 
rose to his feet. 

“Our physical selves are not im- 
portant. They are only so much 
organic material that dies and re- 
generates again and again until it 
is worn out — it has no soul. Let 
the Dissolution process take it and 
break it down into atomic com- 
ponents — we do not need it. We 
can find an alternate to flesh, a 
body not of organic compounds 
which wear out so quickly. We 
can go to the machine and peti- 



tion for rebirth,” he finished ex- 
citedly. 

“Oh, yes!” 

And so they went before the 
Machine — the vast, mile-square 
electronic complex that was their 
god — and pleaded their case. 
Their request was irregular, 
though not the first of its kind. 

“I can grant you no organic 
hosts,” the Machine said. “My 
postulate must remain unchanged, 
even though you may be the last 
survivors of your race.” 

“We know that,” he said. “We 
merely ask that you grant us a re- 
ceptacle — just so we may still ex- 
ist and retain sentience.” 

The Machine paused as if in 
thought. They waited silently. 
Finally, the Machine spoke. 

“I will do it,” it said. “You will 
have your rebirth. You will be- 
come parts of me, each of you 
controlling a component computer 
section. You will have no organic 
bodies but metal-and-integrated- 
circuit hosts. End of transmittal.” 
“Thank you, Machine,” they 
said humbly. 

W HEN all was done they 
reached out for each other. 

“I cannot feel you! I have no 
hands!” she cried — yet she did 
not cry aloud though he received 
her message. 

“Nor can I feel you.” She re- 
ceived his thoughts in the same 
manner that he received hers — on 



88 



IF 




the swift wings of quark energy. 

“No arms, no legs — I have no 
body!” she radiated. The force of 
her panic pounded at his mind. 
“No eyes to see you, ears to hear 
you, lips to kiss you — ” 

“They are only tools of your 
senses. You can feel me but not 
that way. This way — ” And his 
mind reached out, touched hers 
gently with hesitant, probing ten- 
drils. 

She felt him and reached out 
likewise. Her touch was soft, gen- 
tle, wondering. 

“It is strange,” she emanated. 
“My physical senses are gone but 
I can feel you, touch you, even 
though we are trapped in these 
metal prisons. I can sense your 
soul, your strength, your firmness 
of character. For the first time, I 
can really feel you” 

“Which is enough,” he said. 

A ND so they existed, doing 
their part of the work for the 
Machine, with only free moments 
now and then to communicate 
with each other. But at least they 
were permitted this small privi- 
lege and they were content. Yet 
Time is unstoppable and brings 
with it decay and change. The 
millennia came and went with 
amazing speed. Even the Ma- 
chine was not immortal. 

So the year came when they 
knew that the Machine was run- 
ning down — perhaps even dying 



— and would soon be gone and 
with it would go their own exis- 
tence. Nothing could be done. 
They could only take comfort in 
each other’s mind-touch. 

Reality often encounters strange 
accidents — in this case a nearby 
star was going nova. The cataclys- 
mic nature of its death let loose 
strange and destructive forces — 
these enveloped the surrounding 
area in a holocaust of heat and 
hard radiation. All matter was vio- 
lently transformed into billions of 
quanta of hard radiation and ener- 
gy, including the metal-and-cir- 
cuitry substance of the Machine — 
save the two life-essences that had 
been trapped in its immobile met- 
al body for eons. 

“What happened?” she asked. 

“A miracle. We are free. The 
nova has somehow pried us loose 
from the Machine and now we 
are pure energy.” 

His life-essence twisted and 
darted in space joyously, easily 
and with the speed of thought 
skirting the nova-caused scenes of 
destruction. 

“Come,” he radiated to her. 
“Use your powers. We are free — 
free to do anything.” 

She joined him and the two 
tumbled and cartwheeled among 
the galaxies, traversing millions of 
miles in mere minutes. 

“Oh, my love!” Her message 
held cosmic laughter. “We have 
succeeded beyond our wildest 



INTHEBEGINNING 



89 




hopes! We shall be together for- 
ever!” 

“Yes,” he replied, coming back 
to her side. “We shall be immor- 
tal — an undying monument to our 
love.” 

But their joy was short-lived, for 
as they traveled through the cos- 
mos they found no sign of life. 
The entire universe was barren of 
any other living things. A terrible 
loneliness possessed the two 
lovers. 

And even as they realized this, 
they noted something else. Every- 
where they went they passed dead 
stars, lifeless planets wandering 
aimlessly in deep space, entire 
galaxies glowing with the radia- 
tion of their death-throes. Watch- 
ing all this, seeing that their cos- 
mos was crumbling around them, 
it was plain to them what was hap- 
pening. The universe was dying. 

He drew her attention to the 
stars. “Look, already it begins to 
contract.” 

And, indeed, the very fabric of 
space-time was pulling closer to- 
gether — the universe was collaps- 
ing upon itself. 

“Is there nothing we can do?” 
shp pleaded. 

His answer was negative. “Even 
we cannot halt its death.” 

Yet an idea began to dawn on 
him. 

“But,” he said excitedly, “per- 
haps we can survive oblivion by 
transferring ourselves somehow to 
the next universe, one yet to be 



born. Yes, we can do it, for sure.” 

“How?” 

“Maybe like this.” Hesitantly, 
fine lines of coruscating energy 
began forming in the area sur- 
rounding them. As she watched, 
wondering, the lines thickened, 
grew more profuse, became al- 
most solid. 

“There — and there. Ah, like 
that.” The energy net became a 
wall around them. “Do as I do 
and make it as strong as possible. 
It will protect us against the final 
holocaust.” 

When they had finished, the en- 
ergy net was like a huge cocoon 
completely enveloping them. He 
examined it, satisfied. 

“Yes, it is good. We shall lie 
dormant here and perhaps — ” he 
paused. “Perhaps we may survive 
the final death and the violent re- 
birth.” And so, unwilling and ap- 
prehensive, they cut off their con- 
sciousnesses and waited. 

The universe contracted japidly 
until all remaining matter was 
clustered so close together that 
tremendous mutual gravitational 
forces induced great collisions, 
giving rise to energies that ini- 
tiated new collisions. The chain 
reaction was so devastating that 
every bit of matter was trans- 
formed into free energy and the 
cosmic egg lay there, seething 
with rampant energy — rampant 
except for a strange energy cyst 
that had somehow resisted the 
tendency toward absolute entropy.

Then rebirth began. With an- 
other violent upheaval the com- 
pact mass began to expand — and 
with expansion, energy trans- 
formed into elementary particles 
— matter — and clumped and co- 
agulated into shapeless masses. 
The seething proto-universe grad- 
ually cooled. Galaxies of dust 
formed, then stars, then, molten 
and primeval, the planets. 

And the energy cyst opened. 

Consciousness returned. He 
looked out and saw the new uni- 
verse. 

“We did it.” 

She saw, too. “Yes,” she said 
unbelievingly. “We live!” 

He wanted to fly, to cavort in 
triumph — but he could not. In his 
dormancy he had offered much of 
his power to buffering the energy 
cyst and so had she. The two sur- 
vived — but with only a small frac- 
tion of their former capabilities. 

“I am weak,” she said. Indeed, 
her emanations were fluctuating 
and hard to read. He felt the same 
way. 

They drifted together, each 
helping the other. 

“We cannot exist long like this,” 
he said. “Our powers are ebbing 
steadily. And if each transferral to 
a new universe is so taxing: — I am 
not sure I would like to continue 
after this one is gone.” 

“But we have love still,” she 
said hopefully. 

“Yes, we have our love.” 



Suddenly he guided her to a 
bright, hot star, its newly formed 
planets just beginning to orbit. 

“A monument, then, to our 
love,” he declared. “We return to 
matter, from whence we came.” 

Her aura seemed to brighten. 
“Yes, I see what you mean!” 

“I will be this star,” he said and 
his life-essence diffused into the 
ball of plasma and gas. 

“And I will be this planet,” she 
stated, doing the same to one of 
the molten satellites. 

They sucked up quarks and 
quintessences of energy. 

“Oh, I feel stronger already,” 
she exclaimed. 

“I, too.” The sun seemed to 
burn brighter. “You alone, of all 
these planets, will receive my 
blessing. On you will I make life 
flourish as a symbol of my love for 
you.” 

“Then I will return that love 
and bloom rampant with life. Our 
monument will live for as long as 
this universe endures.” 

“And that,” he said, “is 
enough.” 

A ND when the life-forms 
gained sentience .they mar- 
veled at the vast profusion of life 
on their world. Looking up at 
their star, they paid homage to 
the power that had bestowed its 
blessing on them alone and called 
it Sol. And his mate — their moth- 
er-planet — they called Terra. • 



INTHE BEGINNING 



91 





O NCE upon a time it was al- 
most impossible to find a book 
by an unknown writer in the fields 
of science fiction or fantasy. The 
author either had already estab- 
lished himself with shorter works 
or his novel had been serialized in 
the magazines long before it ap- 
peared in book form. 

This no longer holds true. From 
even a hasty scanning of the 
shelves, it is obvious that a great 
many writers today are breaking 
into print initially in books. Del- 
aney and LeGuin built their rep- 
utations outside the magazines 
and many more current examples 
exist. 

It is still a happy occasion when 
a first appearance represents both 
good writing and a gift for story- 
telling, however. 



The Warlock in Spite oj Him- 
self , by Christopher Stasheff (Ace, 
75c) probably has the year’s 
worst title and it is the work of a 
writer unknown at least to me. He 
also, unforgivably, combines 
science fiction and outright fan- 
tasy in the same story. On top of 
that, the publishers make the book 
seem one of those repulsively me- 
chanical attempts at humor in a 
singularly unappealing blurb. 

Nevertheless, this rather fat 
book is a cracking good tale and a 
well-integrated story, told with a 
smooth command of the lan- 
guage. After the first few pages 
even the humor quiets down to a 
gently effective sense of fun. 

The story takes place on Gram- 
arye, a world colonized and then 
lost to the records. But appar- 



92 




ently this planet was settled by 
rich and eccentric members of the 
Society for Creative Anachronism 
who were determined to recreate 
feudalism in all its aspects. Rod- 
ney and Fess — an epileptic robot 
horse — are sent to Gramarye to 
bring some measure of democratic 
government into its medievalism. 

They soon find evidence that 
other forces are tinkering behind 
the scenes, trying to create either 
absolute dictatorships or total 
anarchy. The young queen is wil- 
fully busy alienating all her lordly 
friends by experimenting with a 
feudal welfare state. 

Rodney naturally winds up in 
the middle of things. His general 
attitude is properly science-fic- 
tional, as are many of the trap- 
pings. Even such things as time 
machines don’t phase him and his 
wizardry is based solidly on tech- 
nical tricks. 

But' at least half of Gramar- 
ye works by magic. There are 
witches galore and elves all over 
the landscape, all mixed up in the 
government. There is even a group 
of fine, upstanding ghosts who du- 
tifully haunt an ancestral castle. 
And Rodney is recognized by all 
as a genuine warlock. Maybe he 
is, despite his protests. 

In the end most of the magic 
elements become integrated into 
the science framework. But it isn’t 
one of the horrible “logical” end- 
ings that so often ruin science fan- 



tasy. The Little People are far 
more than mutations and the 
ghosts remain honest ghosts. 

The mixture should not work 
at all — but somehow everything 
comes together into a good and 
satisfying adventure. The story is 
not a major one or particularly 
significant but it’s more fun to 
read than anything I’ve seen by a 
new writer in much too long a 
time. 

There’s room here for a sequel, 
since Rodney really should be 
proved an authentic warlock even- 
tually. I hope Stasheff is working 
on it. 

M ichael crichton was 

also unknown before his book 
The Andromeda Strain (Alfred A. 
Knopf, $5.95). And though his 
book is currently on the best- 
seller list and has drawn rave re- 
views as science fiction all over the 
country, I rather wish he’d stayed 
unrecognized. 

This is just the sort of thing 
that the general reader will take 
as science fiction. It has a future 
setting, a threat to the world, lots 
of talk of science and innumer- 
able tricks, all too clever. It 
labors desperately to let the 
reader know the writer is aware 
of every little detail. It has com- 
puter pictures and even a bibli- 
ography of reference works from 
its future time. And to me it’s 
about as convincing as pink

cheese as the basic Lunar surface. 

The initial situation isn’t bad, 
though we’ve all seen it before. A 
satellite set to probe near space 
brings back a sample of some- 
thing from a few hundred miles 
up. That sample turns out to be, 
apparently, a deadly plague from 
space. The men who locate the 
thing immediately die and inves- 
tigators find a whole village where 
death seems to have come almost 
instantaneously. There are, how- 
ever, two puzzling survivors — 
a prying infant and a drink-sod- 
den old man. 

Four doctors are chosen to find 
the nature and cure for this dan- 
ger. (They all have names and 
carefully worked out characters 
but I find almost nothing that 
sticks in my memory about them 
since they never quite came to 
life.) With the survivors and sam- 
ples, they are sealed into a great 
underground laboratory that has 
already been constructed to meet 
the danger of plague from space. 

AH the scenes you might ex- 
pect are there. Every theory turns 
out to be wrong, of course. And 
there’s even a faulty computer 
and an atomic power pile set to 
blow up and wipe them cfut when 
the emergency button is pressed. 
Naturally it gets pressed and the 
people have to run about until 
the last second to turn it off. (Ob- 
viously, however, they must have 
succeeded for their names to be 



mentioned in the bibliography. 
Some of the too-conscious work 
of making this all “real” back- 
fires here.) 

The chief plotting trouble, how- 
ever, comes in the nature of the 
plague. It’s impossible to accept 
long before the story ends. 

Apparently Crichton felt that 
science-fiction touches should be 
used with a shotgun and without 
aiming. We’re told that this plague 
acts as a blood disease. Then we 
find it’s a crazy crystal that needs 
nothing from the blood it can’t 
get from the air. We learn next 
that it somehow works by “atomic 
fusion”— which is interesting 
indeed, since it seemingly pro- 
duces no great amount of energy. 

And about then the plague 
seems to realize that with all that 
gadgetry it has no need to infect 
humans in its development, so it 
stops infecting them and begins 
to infect machines! Anyhow, it 
only worked for people who had a 
normal hydrogenion or pH read- 
ing; no reason we can see, it just 
worked that way. 

In the end, the whole intent of 
the book becomes anti-sf. The 
plague killed off perhaps a hun- 
dred people — one village and a 
few others. It then began mutat- 
ing into something harmless. But 
somehow the result of this un- 
manned flight accident proves 
conclusively to the nation and the 
scientific community that all

IF 




manned (sic!) flight into space 
must be discontinued because of 
danger. 

If you’re looking for social 
significance the book has a mes- 
sage in its final chapter. That 
message . can best be summed up 
as: “Man wasn’t meant to . 

T HE theme of danger to Earth 
from space aliens is also cover- 
ed in The Pollinators of Eden, by 
John Boyd (Weybright & Talley, 
$5.50) — but with a completely 
different approach. Here the basic 
idea is made convincing by some 
rather sharp characterization and 
a much higher level of writing. 
Boyd is still a new writer but hard- 
ly an unrecognized one — this is his 
second book. His first won excel- 
lent reviews. 

The basic situation here is de- 
veloped directly. The material is 
familiar but its handling is fresh 
and thp, developments of the basic 
idea are generally good. 

Freda Caron is a botanist. Her 
fiance sends her some seeds and 
two “tulips” from the newly dis- 
covered planet of Flora, where 
flowers have filled most of the 
ecological niches. The tulips are 
not only singularly beautiful — 
they emit sounds and even mimic 
words. The big problem is that 
nobody can figure how they pol- 
linate. 

She sets about discovering this 
in collaboration with a young 



man who had been with her fi- 
ance, Paul. Hal, their assistant, 
is a brilliant theoretician, though 
somewhat sloppy in his methods. 

Through these people’s eyes, 
we see a step-by-step development 
of the danger from the flowers. 
The tulips take over, adapt hor- 
nets to pollinate themselves and 
begin to exert a strange sexual in- 
fluence on Freda. And they refuse 
to be restrained. Every effort to 
limit their spread seems to be 
doomed. 

The plants succeed in killing 
Hal by supersonics. 

Freda is faced with other diffi- 
culties. Her career at her uni- 
versity is being undermined by 
academic politics and she is 
forced to testify with disastrous 
results on the national political 
scene. Her own character is 
changing during this time, in- 
creasing the tension. 

Thr author does not, however, 
merely tell another story of the 
plants that conquer a world. The 
menace is real but solutions are 
possible. The plants can be sub- 
dued. The factors in Freda’s per- 
sonal life are less easy to cope 
with. 

All this builds up nicely through 
more than eighty percent of the 
novel. Then everything changes. 

Freda manages to get herself 
sent to Flora to join Paul in his 
Eden island where he is studying 
some extraordinary orchids. And 



THE READING ROOM 



95 




the final twenty percent of the 
book manages to undo almost 
everything that the author has 
developed to that point. 

Every character undergoes a 
sudden change. Paul, portrayed 
as a puritanical intellectual, turns 
out to be a sloppy hedonist, easily 
dominated by his plants. Freda’s 
sexual problems vanish immedi- 
ately as she imitates her fiance. 
Dead Hal is recast into a man 
capable only of claiming credit 
for another’s work. And when 
Freda is sent back to Earth the 
story development manages to de- 
teriorate even further. 

From now on, she has one sim- 
ple solution to every problem — 
she reads men’s minds and sat- 
isfies their bodies, gaining her 
goals with all the ingenuity of a 
female turtle. 

On page 174, this was a darned 
fine book. By 190, it had gone 
pretty much to pieces, with most 
of what had gone before destroyed. 
The final twenty-two pages simply 
grind along somehow to an ending 
that means nothing emotionally 
(except for minor shock value) to 
anyone but Freda — if she has any 
real emotions left by this time. 

T HE schizoid story seems to be 
a rather standard trap into 
which many beginning writers fall 
after their first success. (The first 
book usually has to be more tra- 
ditionally organized to sell at all, 



and writers with any talent seem to 
know this by instinct.) It usually 
has a sort of set pattern, known 
by some editors as the “steak and 
whipped cream” story. The first 
part will be a sort of wish-dream 
fluff, filled mostly with yearning 
and hot air. 

I’ve heard a lot of theories 
about why this is so. My own 
guess is that the writer has some 
grandiose idea dear to his heart 
but one he never could quite turn 
into a story. Now, flushed with in- 
itial success, he digs it out and in- 
sists on writing it. It won’t really 
work by itself, so he goes back to 
his skill to construct a story be- 
fore it. Then he tries a “daring” 
or “experimental” trick of break- 
ing from that over to the thing he 
wanted to write with total lack of 
critical judgment all along. 

The pattern is usually the 
same. Aside from the sudden 
break in the plot, there will be a 
radical change of character. This 
has to be, since the real charac- 
ters of his hard section would not 
fit with the nebulous grandeur or 
emotional wallowing of the sec- 
ond. And the second part is usu- 
ally an emotional dream where 
every wish is gratified or an intel- 
lectual one where vast ideas are 
displayed. 

A fully developed writer would 
spot the danger in his idea and 
never write it. But such self-anal- 
ysis comes to many only after long 



96 



IF 




practice and a spate of well-argued 
rejections. 

We can understand the writers, 
perhaps. But there is more diffi- 
culty in seeing why an editor lets 
his authors get away with such 
stuff. When he lets something as 
obvious as the “steak and whip- 
ped cream” story get by, he is 
neither protecting his readers nor 
helping his writers to develop. 

There was enough material in 
Boyd’s first eighty percent to just- 
ify a complete reexamination. Al- 
most certainly, Freda could have 
met her problems on Earth by 
simply facing them. Or the affair 
on Flora might have been devel- 
oped into a novel. As it is, the 
reader has been robbed of two 
stories. 

B OB SHAW’S latest book suf- 
fers from some of the same 
trouble, though to a lesser extent. 
And that’s something I regret 
very deeply. I feel that Shaw is 
potentially one of the finest of the 
new writers who are beginning to 
emerge. His short fiction has been 
excellent and his first novel from 
Ace presented a writer in full 
control of his abilities. 

* The Palace of Eternity , by Bob 
Shaw (Ace Special, 75c) is even 
better for much of its length. It 
has good characters, good back- 
ground and a quite interesting 
situation featuring aliens. The 
writing is sharp, the action deft. 



Tavenor has been orphaned by 
a seemingly senseless alien raid 
and has spent most of his life in 
the military, fighting to avenge his 
parents’ death. But now he has re- 
tired and moved to Mnemosyne, a 
planet that seems to have attrac- 
ted all the artists and poets. For 
some reason inspiration flows 
there as nowhere else. 

Suddenly Tavenor finds that his 
Elysium has not only beeir em- 
broiled in the Earth-alien war but 
Mnemosyne is now the very cen- 
ter of that war. Completely under- 
standing both sides, he watches 
the military bureaucracy trample 
down the character of this unus- 
al planet. 

He’s almost alone in this under- 
standing, save for a few rebels 
whom he recognizes as gallant but 
futile visionaries. His only real 
contact is an odd, fey girl-child of 
three years — a serious tot with a 
strange touch that heals. 

A series of events forces Taven- 
or to help the rebels. His posi- 
tion as a professional soldier of 
thirty years’ experience lighting 
the aliens offers them their only 
chance to survive. 

Yet he cannot deny the need 
for the military forces, parti- 
cularly since it is obvious to him 
that men are losing the war and 
that Mnemosyne may soon feel 
the wanton killings by the aliens. 

Good. It’s a complex story, just 
moving forward toward its mean-

ing, toward a resolution for the 
planet, the human race — and for 
Tavenor. 

Then we get a sudden jarring 
development that’s like an ice 
cube down the back. Tavenor is 
taken out of the action. I read on, 
hoping that this meant Shaw had 
something big enough in mind to 
dare a trick that only seemed out- 
rageous. But I waS'Wrong. 

The steak is done and from that 
point — about two-thirds of the 
way through the book — there is 
only a spate of uncritically presen- 
ted “big ideas” filled with hokum. 
We’re given immortal souls that 
are being killed by men. (What 
these souls really do with all their 
time is left unstated. Look, they’re 
souls, dig? Ain’t that a big enough 
idea? Souls don’t need develop- 
ment, characterization, purpose 
beyond survival, all that guff. This 
is deep philosophy, man! Like 
love.) 

Tavenor gets his own soul plant- 
ed in his infant son. And all the 
fun begins. 

Once a strong and thoughtful 
man, he now becomes a human 
jellyfish. The mother, fine enough 
to attract Tavenor in his original 
form, is now a lump — literally, al- 



most. The little girl grows up in 
the background but is abruptly a 
selfish and badly spoiled normal 
kid. 

Tavenor no longer acts. He has 
things happen to him, while he 
vaguely feels unhappy. He and 
the now-grown girl are caught by 
the horrible aliens. Okay, now we 
get the motivation for the strange 
actions of the aliens? We do not! 
They were great as distant men- 
aces but they’re pretty silly when 
we meet them in their cages! 

All the toughness and reality 
developed through most of the 
story are gone. When we finally 
find that our girl is a new kind 
of man, the savior of mankind 
and soulkind, the discovery is con- 
vincing as learning the new reality 
about a rather nasty and selfish 
Little Nell! 

After a fine beginning, it’s hard 
to take a conclusion that is emp- 
tily grandiose. And for most 
readers, I suspect the few rewards 
won’t make it worth while to try 
to take it. 

A fairly bad book — as a total- 
ity — doesn’t bother me much. But 
the loss of the story Shaw could 
have made from the first two- 
thirds is a tragedy. •

THE 




STORY 

OF 



OUR 
EARj.ii 



T HE only thing classical writers 
had to say about coal was that 
it emitted a bad smell when burn- 
ing and that it was inferior to “true 
coal” — meaning charcoal. Still, the 
classical w # ord for coal — carbo — 
was used to designate the geolog- 
ical period during which most coal 
originated. (Lignite, also called 
“brown coal,” originated much 
more recently, during the Tertiary 
period.) The Carboniferous Era 
endured nearly 90 million years. 

Twentieth century man has the 
tendency to ask what people 
thought about this or that at a cer- 
tain time in history. The answer is 
that often they did not think. In 
our particular case nobody won- 
dered about the nature of coal — it 



was something you found in cer- 
tain places just as you found iron 
ore or copper ore in others. 

The first man who speculated on 
the nature of coal was that French 
all-around genius, the Count de 
Buffon, who lived from 1707 to 
1788. Coal, he wrote, was the re- 
sult of the luxuriant forests that 
grew when the continents were first 
formed. When the trees died of old 
age and collapsed they either de- 
cayed on the spot or were carried 
by river floods to the sea where 
they finally came to rest in a quiet 
bay. And there they became coal. 

To strengthen the picture Buffon 
mentioned travel reports. He was 
director of the Jardin du Roy (the 
King’s garden— or botanical gar- 



99 



den in our terminology) and saw 
many travelers’ written accounts 
of their journeys. “The number of 
trees which a river like the Missis- 
sippi floats to the sea is incredible 
— at times the number of floating 
trees is such that navigation on the 
river is rendered impossible. It is 
the same with the Amazon river 
and the majority of other rivers in 
thinly settled countries . Travel- 
ers in such forests (in Guiana) pick 
the spot where they intend to 
spend the night by the health of 
the nearby trees so that they might 
not be killed in their sleep by a 
falling tree.” 

The fact that many coal mines 
feature a number of coal seams 
separated by stone seemed to go 
well with Buffon’s idea. The coal 
seam was plant matter scooped up 
and brought to the sea by a river’s 
spring flood. The stone was the 
condensed result of the sand, mud 
and clay carried by the same river 
during the rest of the year. 

The theory worked out so neatly 
that nearly a century passed before 
its major error was recognized — 
namely, the water transport of the 
vegetable matter. Evidence grew 
that the coal seam was where the 
forest had flourished; large root- 
like fossils (called stigmaria) were 
found and occasionally a whole 
tree trunk that had turned to stone 
got in the way of miners who 
hacked away at the coal seam. The 
important point was that these 



trunks did not lie across a seam 
but stood upright. 

Naturally scientists wanted to 
know what plants had gone into 
the making of coal. There were two 
ways of finding out. One was to 
look for recognizable fossils — the 
other was a microscope examina- 
tion. Both courses of investigation 
strangely enough, were difficult, 
though for different reasons. Fos- 
sils simply were rare — only occas- 
ionally did a fossil leafprint turn 
up and always in the stone layers 
that separated the coal seams. The 
ones that were found usually 
looked like fronds of large ferns. 

Microscopic examination suf- 
fered from coal’s blackness. In the 
last decade of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, all microscopes required light 
shining through the specimen. The 
specimen was mounted on a thin 
piece of glass, about 3/4 of an inch 
wide and 3 inches long and placed 
under the microscope. A mirror 
below it sent natural or artificial 
light through it into the tube. Coal, 
no matter how thin the specimen, 
simply blocked the light. 

Could one bleach coal? 

It could be done only by using 
low-strength nitric acid. The pro- 
cess entailed an element of risk. 
An organic substance bleached by 
nitric acid becomes an explosive. 
The danger could, however, be 
minimized by gentle handling of 
the slides and by avoiding open 
flames in the room.

IF 




M icroscopic examination 

showed clearly that the coal 
consisted of the cells of plants. 
Moreover, a botanist could tell 
what kinds of plants. All the cells 
that could be identified were cells 
of what was then called “diversi- 
fied cryptogams.” The modern 
botanical name of this group is 
pteridophyta. It included all ferns, 
club mosses ( Lycopodium , and no 
matter what the popular name 
says they are not mosses), and 
scouring rushes, also known as 
horsetails ( Equisetum ). 

Except for the ferns which still 
are trees in the tropics, these 
plants now grow small. But during 
the Carboniferous period they 
formed enormous forests with four 
main types of trees. One type was 
tree ferns; two others, Lepidoden- 
dron and Sigillaria were club 
mosses while the fourth, Cata- 
mites, was a horsetail. The name 
Lepidodendron was constructed 
by combining the Greek words 
lepidotos (scaly) and dendron 
(tree) because its trunk looked as 
if it were covered with scales. The 
trunk of Sigillaria looks as if some- 
body had stamped his seal on every 
available square inch of the trunk. 

Artists who painted scenes 
showing a coal forest — and there 
are many such paintings — instinc- 
tively arranged the various kinds 
of trees in clusters, a bunch of 
Catamites at the left, a group of 
tree ferns background center and 



a copse of Sigillarias to the right. 
In all probability they were right. 
Plants have a tendency to cluster 
together and exclude other species 
in a given and usually small area. 

A man of our time who has an 
eye for trees and could walk 
around a coal forest (high rubber 
boots are recommended) would 
soon be able to tell the different 
types at a glance. Catamites would 
differ from current horsetails 
mainly by their size— they grew 
fifty feet tall. Tree ferns would 
pose no recognition problem. The 
Lepidodendrons could be recog- 
nized immediately because they 
were old-fashioned in the evolu- 
tionary sense — they formed neith- 
er twigs nor branches as we use 
these term. 

Like one of the trees of that old 
Devonian forest (called the Naples 
Tree, because it was found near 
Naples, N. Y.) the Lepidoden- 
drons simply forked. First the 
trunk divided, then the two prongs 
— and so on until death or infinity. 
The Sigillarias , on the other hand, 
thrust a straight trunk up to one 
hundred feet, with a maximum 
diameter of six feet and a bundle 
of sword-shaped leaves on top. 
The seal-like impressions on the 
trunk are the marks where leaves 
grew when the tree was younger. 

One of the most interesting trees 
belonged to the fern group but only 
a botanist might recognize it. 
Smallish, it bore nutlike seeds at 



THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



101 




the tips of its leaves. All living 
ferns, including the tropical tree 
ferns of today, bear spores. The 
carboniferous seed ferns (there 
were several) formed a separate 
botanical order that has been 
named Cycadofilicales to indicate 
that they must have led to the 
seed-bearing cycad trees. Cycad 
trees are still with us, though they 
are not common. But the seed 
ferns became extinct soon after the 
end of the Carboniferous period. 

A variety of detached fossil 
seeds have been found but it is not 
always known which trees bore 
them. They cannot be pigeonholed 
as fern seeds because we know of a 
seed-bearing tree that was not a 
fern. Its name is Cardaites, a slen- 
der tree often a hundred feet tall 
with dagger-shaped leaves twelve 
to fifteen inches long. It bore small 
winged seeds and it was clearly an 
early member of the order of gym- 
nosperms (“naked seeds”) which 
at present is mainly represented by 
the pine trees. 

Do we know anything about 
carboniferous plants that were not 
trees? We know of some. Of course 
there were many small ferns of the 
size we are most familiar with. 
Some ferns of the period were 
climbing types that used the bigger 
trees for support. Then there was 
an interesting plant named Sphen - 
ophyllum that grew to a height of 
about two feet. If it grew now no 
layman would pay much attention 



to it because it would look perfect- 
ly natural in a wet area. 

It was shaped — though the two 
plants are totally unrelated — like 
today’s goosegrass, Galium apar - 
ine to the botanist. In Sphenophyl - 
lum a dozen or so vertical stems 
grew from a common root. The 
leaves made whorls around the 
stems — six, nine, or twelve usually 
leaves forming a whorl. Between 
twenty and forty whorls grew per 
stem, depending on its length. 
Most of what we would call under- 
brush in the carboniferous forests 
consisted of Sphenophyllum. 

The animals of these forests in- 
cluded our first fliers — dragonflies 
in shape and by relationship — but 
they had wingspreads of up to 
twenty-eight inches. In some for- 
ests they had yard-long but thin 
centipedes for company — remains 
of them came to light only in re- 
cent years in West German coal 
mines. Arachnids were present, 
too, both scorpions and spiders. 
They were not gigantic forms and 
the scorpions may still at that 
time have been water-breathing, a 
fact recently established for their 
Devonian ancestors. Three-inch 
cockroaches crawled over fallen 
tree trunks. 

In the waters of the Carbonifer- 
ous period lurked the first four- 
legged vertebrates known. They 
were long-tailed amphibians with 
five toes on their hindfeet and four 
toes on their front feet. They were 



102 



IF 




not large, averaging four to six feet 
in length in their early forms, 
though by the end of the Carbon- 
iferous period some attained 
lengths of eight and nine feet. The 
general shape of one of them (Di- 
plovertebron) reminds one of a big 
fish with four legs and a long 
mouth full of teeth. Because of the 
construction of their skulls the 
name of the whole group is Stego- 
cephalia or “roof skulls/’ One geo- 
logical period later they were to 
give rise to the reptiles which, in 
turn, would produce the mammals 
and finally the birds. 

The Carboniferous forests were 
swampy lowlands covered by gen- 
erations of growth. Trees fell into 
swamp water which, being virtu- 
ally devoid of oxygen, prevented 
rotting. It is easy to visualize the 
build-up of a thick layer of plant 
matter under these circumstances. 

A river that changed course af- 
ter especially heavy rains flooded 
the whole forest, bringing with it a 
cover of mud and sand. After the 
flood had run off, the original for- 
est was drowned, dead and buried. 
But the mud-and-sand cover was 
not infertile — in time a new forest 
would grow on top of it, making a 
second coal seam. One site in Si- 
lesia showed clearly that such cy- 
cles had taken place there twenty- 
seven times. 

But a time came when the plants 
that formed the coal forest would 
not grow again. In some places a 



topographical change might have 
caused such an area to become too 
dry for a coal forest — but the Car- 
boniferous period as a whole seems 
to have ended because the climate 
grew too cold for its plants. 

And the Permian period began. 



E ARLY m the current century 
— say 60 years ago — geologists 
ran into a problem. The collision 
was first hinted at in a relatively 
harmless manner. Somewhere in 
South Africa, not too far from 
Cape Town, glacier scrapes had 
been found in rocks dating from 
the Permian period. Glacier 
scrapes, in case anybody wonders 
about the meaning of the term, 
are scratches in rock caused by the 
slow motion of a glacier which has 
stones embedded in it. 

The discovery did not disturb 
anybody’s sleep. It simply indi- 
cated that the site of the scratches 
must have been in the path of a 
glacier which had come from a 
nearby mountain range. Soon after 
a similar discovery was made else- 
where in South Africa. Another 
one was reported from India. Then 
the Russians began to talk of signs 
of a cold period in their territory. 
Logically enough, their findings 
centered in the District of Perm, 
which had furnished the name for 
the period. Everyone, of course, 
knew about the glacial period that 
had preceded our own — was it pos- 



THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



103 




sible that there had been one like 
it much earlier in geological his- 
tory? 

Astronomers and those scien- 
tists especially interested in our 
sun were most doubtful. Their con- 
cern was the source of the energy 
the sun radiated into space every 
second of every day. 

The only large-scale source of 
energy anyone could think of at 
the time was the heat produced by 
contraction of the sun under its 
own weight. But if this were the 
case the sun should once have been 
hotter then than it is now — so how 
could there have been an early 
glaciation? 

At this point the Swedish chem- 
ist Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) 
appeared on the scene with a new 
idea. It did not matter so much 
how much heat was received from 
the sun — what mattered was how 
much of that heat could be re- 
tained by the earth. It is obvious 
that dense clouds and especially 
areas covered with freshly fallen 
snow will reflect sunlight back into 
space. Dark ground will absorb 
the sunlight but reradiate it as in- 
frared (heat) which can escape into 
space as easily as visible light un- 
less stopped by something in the 
atmosphere. That something, 
Arrhenius stated, is carbon diox- 
ide. Carbon dioxide absorbs the 
infrared, thereby warming the 
atmosphere. 

Ergo, the temperature of the at- 



mosphere would depend on its car- 
bon dioxide content. The produc- 
ers of carbon dioxide are fires of 
any kind, especially volcanic ones. 
The main consumers are certain 
chemical processes that go under 
the overall name of carbonization 
— carbonatization to purists. 
Plants also consume carbon diox- 
ide as long as the sun is shining 
(they don’t at night) and the size 
and thickness of the coal seams 
show how much carbon dioxide 
was consumed by the plants dur- 
ing the many millions of years of 
carboniferous luxuriance. Unless 
the volcanoes were very active at 
the same time, the vegetation it- 
self must have impoverished the 
air as far as carbon dioxide is 
concerned. During the same per- 
iod the oxygen content of the at- 
mosphere must have increased 
considerably. 

Arrhemius’ theory was at first 
greeted with enthusiasm. Then it 
was more or less forgotten (in the 
United States it was not even 
taught) but it is now back in favor, 
partly because of the high temper- 
ature of Venus and its carbon 
dioxide atmosphere. In any event, 
it agrees with the cold climate of 
the Permian which no geologist 
denies. General glaciation may not 
have occurred but evidently the 
climate was cold enough for gla- 
ciers to form on what may have 
been fairly modest mountain 
ranges.

IF 




Since the word Karroo will be 
mentioned often in what is to fol- 
low it might be practical here to 
explain its meaning. Karroo is the 
name of some landscape in South 
Africa, divided into the Little Kar- 
roo between Cape Town and Port 
Elizabeth, and the Great Karroo to 
the east of it. Originally the world 
was the Hottentot word karusa , 
meaning “dry” or “without 
plants.” It is a mountainous area 
and geologists saw without much 
trouble that the “Karroo forma- 
tion” showed four subformations. 

We now know that the whole 
Karroo formation is “old Per- 
mian” — though it probably does 
not represent the very beginnings 
of that period. Its duration is esti- 
mated at five to six million years. 
The duration of the whole Permian 
period is put at twenty-five million 
years. The telltale signs of glacia- 
tion in the Karroo occur in the 
earliest of its four subdivisions. 

As far back as about the year 
1897, South African geologists be- 
gan to look systematically for fos- 
sils and soon the Annals of the 
Transvaal Museum , the Transac- 
tions of the Geological Society of 
South Africa , and Geological 
Magazine (London) and the Philo- 
sophical Transactions of the Royal 
Society of London carried reports 
on Karroo fossils that fully de- 
served the alleged remark of a 
farmer seeing a giraffe in a zoolog- 
ical garden: “There ain’t no sich 
animal.” 



I N DISCUSSIONS of extinct 
life forms place names are often 
used — such as the Atlantosaurus 
Beds of Wyoming, the Pikermi 
Fauna (after a place in Greece). 
The term in this case was Karroo 
Fossils. Somewhat to my surprise 
I found repeatedly that laymen 
think that such names imply exclu- 
siveness — i.e. that this or that fos- 
silized life form once existed only 
in the place mentioned. This is not 
so. The place name sometimes in- 
dicates the site of the first discov- 
ery — but usually it points to the 
site of the best-preserved fossils of 
a specific type. Karroo Fossils are 
found in Russia and Texas — but 
they first became known from sites 
in South Africa. And while I am 
correcting misunderstandings let 
me add here that it is wrong to call 
a reptile a dinosaur just because it 
is extinct and was fairly large. 
Reptiles are often called “sauri- 
ans” (because sauros is Greek for 
“lizard”) but just as not every bird 
is a chicken, not every saurian is a 
dinosaur. Dinosaurs did not even 
exist when the Karroo layers were 
formed. 

One of the most famous of the 
Karroo reptiles is Brady saurus — 
from Greek bradys , meaning 
“slow.” It is also one of the largest 
1). It was about 10 feet long, with 



1) In older books it is usually listed as Par - 
eiavaurus. This name is now used to 
designate a group of similar reptiles of 
which Bradysaurus is a member. 



THE STORY OF OUR EARTH

an enormously massive skull and 
heavy jaws. The teeth in these 
jaws, as is customary with reptiles, 
are all of the same shape and fairly 
even in size. It has been said jok- 
ingly that a paleontologist looks at 
feet first and at teeth second. 

A joke — but true. The shape of 
the feet, or rather of the whole leg, 
reveals the mode of locomotion — 
usually one glance is enough to 
show whether the animal was a 
runner, a jumper or a climber. The 
teeth show what the beast ate — in 
the case of bradysaurus there can 
be no doubt that its teeth were 
used to grind up tough and dry 
vegetation. Its sturdy legs and 
massive bones made it clear that 
it walked slowly. The tail was 
stumpy and' short. 

What makes this reptile unique 
is not its shape — a plant-eater does 
not need speed because its lunch 
cannot run away. The strangeness 
of this saurian lies in what can only 
be called the exaggeration of its 
skeleton — every bone looks two or 
three times too thick for its length. 
Please don’t ask me to tell you the 
reason. No explanation exists. 

Another puzzling Karroo reptile 
received the name Dicynodon 
(“two dog teeth”) because its jaws 
were innocent of teeth except for 
two very large ones in the upper 
jaw. Just to make its appearance 
more incredible the upper jaw is 
beaked like a turtle’s. Because a 
turtle’s beak is both hard and 



sharp it can be a flesh-eater with- 
out needing teeth. But large tor- 
toises are vegetarians — so the jaws 
of Dicynodon do not tell us any- 
thing about its diet. And the two 
large conical and slightly curved 
“dog teeth” make no sense, unless 
one takes the easy way out and de- 
clares them to be secondary sexual 
characteristics of the males. 

In size reptiles of the Dicynodon 
type range from that of a small cat 
to forms about six feet in length. 
The larger ones could not have 
been very fast and are therefore 
believed to have been vegetarians. 
A late form, Lystrosaurus , appar- 
ently grew tired of dry steppes and 
semideserts and went into the wa- 
ter. These three-foot reptiles as- 
sumed the style of living now prac- 
ticed by the Florida manatee. 

It has been mentioned earlier 
that the teeth of reptiles, though 
they may differ somewhat in size, 
are all alike in shape. The Karroo 
reptiles violated that rule, too. 
Many have a dentition that looks 
so much like that of a mammal, 
especially carnivores, that they 
have been given the collective 
name of theriodons or “mammal 
teeth.” Most of them were dog- 
sized, though they had shorter legs 
than dogs. They probably hunted 
by jumping their prey instead of 
outrunning it. A fairly large repre- 
sentative of that group was found 
near the Dvina river, District of 
Vologda, in Russia. It received the 



106 



IF 




beautiful name of Inostranzevia 
Alexandri. The first part of that 
name is a Latinized version of the 
Russian word for “foreigner.” 

The multitude of differently 
shaped reptiles from the Karroo 
did not make much sense at first, 
beyond demonstrating that the 
evolutionary process was active 
during the Permian period. Then 
many Permian fossils came to light 
in Texas and were thoroughly in- 
vestigated by the American pale- 
ontologist, Samuel Wendell Willis- 
ton. 

Most important of the Texas 
fossils was one discovered at West 
Coffee Creek in Baylor County. 
The nearest town is Seymour, so 
the reptile was named Seymouria 
baylorensis. It was not quite two 
feet in overall length and it looked 
like a lizard with an unusually 
large head and an unusually short 
tail. The skull was rare for a rep- 
tile’s in being completely closed. 
Most reptiles have either two or 
four holes in their skulls, named 
Jenestrae (Latin for “windows”). 
The jenestrae do not expose the 
brain which is small and protected 
by a bony capsule of its own. 

The lack of jenestrae was impor- 
tant because here was a reptile 
with a skull like those of the am- 
phibians of the preceding Carbon- 



2) So named because of the complicated 
construction of their teeth. 



iferous period. One group of the 
carboniferous amphibians, called 
the labyrinthodons , 2) could be 
singled out as the direct ancestors 
of seymouria. It was the most 
primitive reptile known but it cer- 
tainly was a reptile, not a peculiar 
amphibian. Reptiles like seymour- 
ia were soon found elsewhere and 
they go under the collective name 
of seymouromorphs. Perversely, 
none is known from the Karroo so 
far, but an American descendant 
of seymouria has an African coun- 
terpart so a seymouromorph must 
have been around in Africa— 
course, during the Permian periov 
all continents were still huddled to- 
gether. 

Williston reasoned that there 
had to be a group of reptiles that 
were the earliest and most primi- 
tive and he called this group the 
cotylosaurs (Greek kotylos means 
a small cup — I presume that this 
refers to an anatomical character- 
istic). Seymouria was a fine exam- 
ple and then it was realized that 
the Karroo reptiles and their rela- 
tives elsewhere all had to be con- 
sidered diversified cotylosaurs. 

The period was simply an evolu- 
tionary explosion. Many of these 
early forms died out before the 
Permian reached its end. But some 
were the ancestors of the later rep- 
tiles. And even during the Permian 
a few showed that they were on 
their way to becoming mammals.#

s of the universe said 
ut Man's last breath 



sank slowly below the 
^ purple hills. The tattered 
clouds that streamed up the west- 
ern sky were orange, red and 
violet banners flying above a tragic 
army marching beyond the horizon 
to some final glory. 



They watched it from inside 
the room, the man and his visitor. 
The window that framed the scene 
was the only place in the room, 
except the door,^that had not been 
submerged in a tide of books. 
They had mounted the walls and 



toppled into corners and reached 
tooled-leather fingers across the 
floor. 

The visitor stood in front of 
the window, his stocky figure 
silhouetted against the light. He 
was a little blurred around the 
edges, like an afterimage that is 
beginning to fade. But he was 
solid enough. 

The room was silent. But the 
silence was rippled with words 
that had been spoken— the way a 
still pond remembers the pebbles 
tossed into it. 

As the colors faded in the west 
a husky voice spoke out of the 
silence and out of the darkness 
that clasped one corner of the 
room, revealing only the arm of 
a tapestry-covered chair, a hand 
that rested motionless upon it and 
a foot stuck out stiffly onto a 
stool, the thin sole touched by a 
single orange ray of sun. 

“How will it end?” the voice 
asked. 

The answer came over the 
visitor’s shoulder in cultured reso- 
nant words with a hint of accent 
like those of a foreigner who has 
learned to speak the language 
better than the natives. 

“In fire, in ice, with a bang, 
with a whimper, by cosmic ac- 
cident, by man’s own will and 
hand. What does it matter?” 

“I would know.” 

“That is the most persistent 
trait of intelligence.” 



“You will not tell me?” 
“Perhaps I do not know. Per- 
haps I cannot say. We are not 
gods, you know.” 

“What are you, then?” 
“Scientists, experimenters. In 
your language those words might 
describe us best.” 

“And we are your experi- 
ment.” 

The visitor turned around. His 
face, too, was shadowed. 

“Yes.” 

“And now the experiment is 
over.” 

“We have found out what we 
wished to know. We clean the test 
tube, sterilize the equipment. You 
should understand.” 

“Understand? I should not 
even believe— and yet I do. With- 
out knowing why.” 

“All your life has been prep- 
aration for this moment. You can- 
not help but believe. But you also 
must understand.” 

“Intellectually I do. Emotion- 
ally I cannot accept the statement 
that this experiment has achieved 
its purpose— that man cannot 
achieve more.” 

“It is not men, you under- 
stand, but the experiment. Men 
have had millions of years, hun- 
dreds of thousands of generations, 
thousands of civilizations. What 
men can do further is repetition. 
And yet—” 

“Do you give me hope?” the 
husky voice asked. 



THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT 



109 




“There is no hope. There is 
only this odd contradiction in man 
that you mention, this tension 
between his intelligence and his 
animal instincts. He calls it emo- 
tion. The curious interplay between 
your reason and instincts has kept 
us fascinated long past the ex- 
periment’s planned duration. But 
there are many more odd facets 
to the universe that we would 
explore and this small complica- 
tion has preoccupied us too long. 
We can deal with the curious fact 
of man in ways that are not so 
complex— nor so expensive.” 

‘‘Leave us. Let us live out our 
destiny.” 

‘‘We are your destiny. You 
exist only as an experiment. Does 
the scientist leave his laboratory to 
build another when one experiment 
is completed? Neither do we. And 
although this laboratory— the very 
concept of which staggers your 
imagination— is only one among 
many, we do not waste. To us 
waste is unimaginable.” 

‘‘If you have no love for what 
you have created— have you no 
pity?” 

“None.” 

“No feeling?” 

‘‘None. We are rational beings. 
Our only motivation is the search 
for knowledge. Perhaps once— so 
far back in the mists of our begin- 
ning that even we have forgotten— 
we had that confusion of intellect 
that you call feeling. If so, it has 



been lost irretrievably. We can no 
more keep from doing the rational 
than you can stop breathing. On 
the other hand, you have evolved 
recently and rapidly. You are an 
accretion of characteristics, some 
of them incompatible.” 

The man said nothing. 

‘‘We had speculated that intel- 
ligence is the superior and domi- 
nant characteristic,” the visiter 
continued. ‘‘But we found that 
among men this is true only 
occasionally. These men you call 
monsters. We find them dull. But 
you confused and emotional ones 
have fascinated us beyond your 
allotted span.” 

‘‘You are the monsters.” 

‘‘You would consider us so. 
And yet we do nothing that is not 
rational, whereas you use your 
intelligence largely to rationalize 
the crimes you commit against 
your fellows.” 

“‘We create,” said the man. 

T HE visitor stepped forward. 

His shoes and trousered legs 
looked ordinary in the light cast 
from a distant corner by a floor 
lamp. His shoulders and face still 
were in darkness. 

‘‘Yes, you create— far beyond 
your predictable powers. Insanely, 
without plan or reason. Your crea- 
tion is a magnificent waste; we 
cannot understand it because we 
cannot waste. We do not have 
what you call art or music or 



110 



IF 




literature. We do not understand 
what you call beauty or what you 
call ugliness— except in theory.” 
‘‘Then man has something to 
offer— something you do not have. 
He can complement your rational 
existence with his irrational cre- 
ativity. With his assistance there 
is nothing you cannot do, no goals 
to which you cannot aspire.” 

‘‘We do not wish to do any- 
thing. We aspire to nothing except 
to knowledge. And that we seek 
in our own rational ways— which 
the addition of emotion would 
only muddle. And now, of course, 
man seeks to move beyond this 
test tube in which the human ex- 
periment began and to infest and 
to destroy other experiments. To 
allow you to do so would not be 
rational. Your defense of mankind 
is futile. Man cannot be saved. 
He is doomed.” 

The man in the shadows sighed. 
After a moment he said, ‘‘You 
let slip the fact that there are 
other ways to deal with the fact 
of man.” 

‘‘I let nothing slip. We make 
no mistakes.” 

‘‘What are these ways? Would 
you try to understand us intel- 
lectually? Will you run us through 
your computers until we make 
sense?” 

‘‘That is not possible. But ever 
since the end of the experiment 
has been obvious— for the last 
three millennia— we have chosen 



the most creative among you. They 
have been— there is not quite the 
word in your language to describe 
it — translated into another exist- 
ence. We have chosen religious 
innovators, military leaders, polit- 
ical geniuses, philosphers, artists, 
writers, composers, scientists—” 
‘‘Christ and Mohammed?” 
‘‘And Gautama Siddhartha.” 
‘‘Machiavelli?” 

‘‘And Solon and Jefferson.” 
‘‘Plato and Aristotle?” 

‘‘And Kant and Nietzsche.” 
‘‘Michelangelo?” 

‘‘And Praxiteles and Picasso.” 
‘‘Shakespeare?” 

‘‘And Homer and Heming- 
way.” 

‘‘Bach and Beethoven?” 
‘‘Brahms and Berlioz.” 
‘‘Archimedes?” 

‘‘Galileo and Newton and Ein- 
stein. There are thousands more 
and thousands whose names you 
never heard— all of them creators. 
And that is why I am here to- 
night.” 

‘‘I wondered. I am none of 
these. I have never created any- 
thing.” 

‘‘You are one of them,” the 
visitor said. ‘‘The fact that you 
have not exercised your creativity 
yet is incidental. We may not have 
it ourselves— we may not under- 
stand it— but we have learned to 
recognize creativity and its signs. 
In the relative eternity to come you 
will have time to be creative.”

“Me. Among them?” 

“You are one of them— of 
equal stature. You can be one of 
them for long ages, interacting 
with them, learning from them as 
they will learn from you and we 
from all— in a way that you have 
only imagined here among your 
books.” 

“Incredible-” 

“In your terms— yes.” 

“My dreams. Heaven.” 

“So we understand.” 

“If I were a superstitious man 
of another age I would think you 
an emissary of the devil come to 
tempt me.” 

“We are all the devil and all 
the god you im. jine— both and 
neither. In another age we spoke 
in their language and in their 
frame of reference, as we speak to 
you in yours.” 

“In what way would existence 
continue?” 

The man had leaned forward 
until his upper body, clothed in a 
gray sweater, was in the light, 
although his face still was in the 
shadows. 

“In a way much like what you 
experience now, with certain meas- 
ures taken to delay your mor- 
tality.” 

“And where would it con- 
tinue?” 

“In a place removed from here 
but one you would find pleasant, 
stocked with all the things you 
enjoy— the food, the drink, the 



books, the music and the art— and 
the people and the talk and the 
ideas and the time to contemplate 
and to create.” 

“Stop.' You describe heaven.” 
“So you would consider it.” 
“You know me well.” 

“What we can know we know 
well.” 

The silence returned while the 
man sank back in his chair and 
the visitor looked back toward the 
west where the sunset had faded 
and the twilight had darkened into 
night. The evening star gleamed 
brilliantly alone above the hills. 

Finally the man spoke again. 
“What of my wife?” 

The visitor turned back to the 
room. “The person who let me 
in— but only when I insisted? Who 
called you a fool?” 

“Yes.” 

“You do not find her attrac- 
tive.” 

“I did once.” 

“You do not love her.” 

“Once I did.” 

“She is not exceptional. We 
cannot save her. In any case, you 
will not lack for feminine com- 
panionship of a more congenial 
sort in the place where you are 
going.” 

The man laughed. 

“Not only heaven but par- 
adise.” 

“So you will consider it.” 

“I believe, after all, that you 
are an emissary of the devil— you

know so well how to tempt a 
man.” 

“We are rational.” 

‘‘And you want to understand 
the irrational. What about the rest 
of humanity?” 

‘‘A few, like you, we will save. 
The rest will be destroyed. They 
are worthless, redundant. Even 
you will admit this.” 

‘‘In my more rational mo- 
ments— perhaps I would. But why 
do you come to me this way and 
explain these things to me? If I 
accepted them as reality— as more 
than the strange ravings of a mad- 
man or the stranger imaginings of 
my own mind— why should you 
not merely take me away when 
you destroy the rest?” 

‘‘Perhaps your understanding 
is a condition of the translation. 
Perhaps it is part of the experi- 
ment. Perhaps it is both.” 

‘‘Or neither. What if I should 
refuse?” 

T HE visitor stopped in the act 
of speaking. For the first time 
he appeared uncertain. He stepped 
forward. He wore an ordinary blue 
jacket. 

‘‘Why should you? Why should 
you throw away what you desire 
most?” 

‘‘Would you take me anyway?” 
The man leaned forward into 
the light. He was in his middle 
years — still vigorous but no longer 
young. 



‘‘No. It would do you no good 
to refuse, however. You would be 
throwing away your chances of 
eternity and the satisfactions of 
creation in a foolish gesture. You 
cannot save mankind.” 

‘‘I cannot be a party to its 
destruction either. If the others 
before me agreed to your pro- 
posal— perhaps they did not have 
to contemplate the imminent 
obliteration of the rest.” 

The visitor stepped forward 
fully into the light. He had an 
ordinary face. Now it seemed dis- 
turbed. , 

‘‘You would refuse?” 

‘‘Yes. I refuse.” 

‘‘But why? What do you gain? 
What can you hope to achieve?” 
‘‘Perhaps I refuse the essential 
conditions of your offer. Perhaps 
by this act I refuse to join those 
who would profit from the suffer- 
ings they inflict on those capable 
of understanding the nature of 
their plight. Perhaps I refuse to 
profit personally from an act 
which destroys my race. Perhaps 
I choose to demonstrate to you in 
this conclusive fashion that you 
do not understand man at all, that 
all the other experiments you 
might perform are meaningless be- 
side this one, that you wipe it 
out not because it is finished but 
because you cannot understand 
it.”

PART III 
CONCLUSION 

THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



KEITH LAUMER 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

JEFF MALLORY awoke. The 
dawn was strange and misty. His 
war wound throbbed. He seemed 
to have fatigued and aged during 
the night , — even his clothes, busi- 
ness suit and shoes, shirt and tie, 
were worn, all but used up, and he 
needed a haircut. 

Dressed, he looked through his 
bedroom window. The good subur- 
ban neighborhood was unkempt 
this morning. The neighbors 
lawn featured cast-off junk. His 
own usually well-kept home 
showed neglect . 

He went down to breakfast. 



GILL, the woman he loved and 
had married, looked tired and slo- 
venly. The normally well-stocked 
cupboard was bare. The two 
younger children — MARLY and 
RANDY — were ruder than they 
usually were. The kitchen stank of 
garbage. And LORI, Jeffs teen- 
ager, was missing entirely. 

She seemed to have been been 
erased. Gill denied that Lori had 
ever existed. The neighbors did 
not remember her. Her room in 
the house had vanished. Other 
pertinent bits of Jeffs life had 
melted away as if he had merely 
dreamed them — his burgeoning 
business, his plans for the future. 



114 



Gill explained, as she would to a 
child or a sick man. Jeff owned no 
business. She and he worked — as 
did everyone else they knew — at 
the Star Tower. She pointed at the 
window. 

The mist outside had lifted. Jeff 
saw a huge tower in the distance, 
dominating the town. The struc- 
ture, several hundred feet in dia- 
meter, seemed to have grown 
there overnight but Gill behaved 
as if it had stood there forever. 

Becoming aware of an intruder 
— at once human and nonhuman 
— in the house, Jeff tried to fight. 
The intruder easily knocked him 
out m and when Jeff came to. Gill 
was gone. Where and what was 
reality? Jeff knocked a hole in a 
plaster wall where Lori's room 
used to be and found the room 
but no Lori. 

Outside — neighbors who had 
known Lori had no recollection of 
her. They all seemed enslaved by 
the alien masters of the Star Tow- 
er, remembered no other exis- 
tence. Jeff encountered more of 
the aliens , fought them and man- 
aged to escape. His hunt for Lori 
took him to Sally Hodges, once 
Lori's friend — and at Sally's he 
encountered a lawless group of 
refugees who believed that the 
country had been invaded by the 
Russians. 

Jeff was unable to convince 
them otherwise, finally had to flee 
for his life. Sally, although she 
thought he was suffering from de- 

US 



lusions, accompanied him in a 
commandeered truck. They were 
captured by soldiers and taken to 
a U.S. — Russian military encamp- 
ment under the command of Colo- 
nel Strang. 

The encampment was isolated, 
self-contained. Both Strang and 
the Russians were convinced they 
were fighting Chinese Commu- 
nists and Jeff's theory of semi- 
human aliens failed to impress 
anyone. He and Sally separated. 
Then Jeff was forcibly “ drafted " 
into Strang's "army." 

Mallory meets Lori at Strang's 
encampment, finds Lori had 
thought him dead. They are not 
permitted to associate with each 
other but Mallory forces his way to 
the women's quarters after hours 
and they talk. Lori believes Chi- 
nese occupy Beatrice, Mallory's 
home town — she thinks her father 
insane when he tells her about the 
aliens. She is in love with Strang, 
has implicit faith in him. But she 
helps Mallory and Sally to escape. 
Sally, however, is wounded in the 
action and Mallory goes on alone. 

He seeks shelter in a lighted 
house, is captured by crossbowmen 
who take him to their leader. 
Brother Jack Harmony of Revela- 
tion College. Brother Harmony is 
a religious fanatic, attributes 
Earth' s invasion to the devil. While 
trying to convince Brother Har- 
mony of what has actually hap- 
pened, Jeff sees Harmony commit 




a murder and once more has to 
flee. 

He accidentally kills Harmony, 
steals a car, escapes . Desperate 
with fatigue and lonely, he talks to 
himself while driving— finds an - 
other voice chiming in from his 
subconscious , directing him to 
“the old house." 

He finds the place — seems to re- 
member it. He discovers a dead 
man in the front hall and a living 
but very old man , kept alive by a 
machine, in a bedroom. The old 
man mistakenly addresses Mallory 
as ALGORIC, introduces himself 
asGONYL. 

When he realizes his error about 
Jeffs identity Gonyl rantingly tells 
him that he and Algoric are repre- 
sentatives of an intergalactic or- 
ganization and had been posted on 
Earth to save the planet from the 
alien invasion Jeff has witnessed. 
The aliens are MONE — “an intel- 
ligent virus with a genius for adapt- 
ability and a hunger for interstellar 
conquest." 

Gonyl and Algoric had been 
sent to Earth as young men to 
await and warn of the arrival of 
Mone. Algoric had proven faithless 
to his trust, had fallen in love with 
an Earth woman and deserted his 
iost. Now that the Mone has ar- 
rived, Gonyl is unable to send the 
alarm to his intergalactic superiors 
because Algoric had the other nec- 
cessary half of the code pattern 
needed to send the message. 



As Gonyl talks it becomes in- 
creasingly clear to Mallory that he 
has “known" Algoric at some 
stage of his life — and abruptly he 
remembers an “imaginary" uncle 
who had taken him on magic trips, 
one a visit to this very house. 

The memory dates back to Jeffs 
childhood. He compares notes with 
Gonyl, who decides that Mallory is 
a descendant of Algoric* s associa- 
tion with the Earth woman and 
that Mallory probably controls the 
missing code pattern. 

He demands that Mallory di- 
vulge it. But suddenly Mallory 
distrusts the old man. 

“Eve heard enough of your lies," 
he says. “Now tell me the truth." 

VIII 

G ONYL raged. He wept. 

In the end he babbled, “Ah, 
you’ve taken advantage of me, a 
weak old man — but all my life 
I’ve been a victim of circum- 
stance, driven by forces outside 
myself, by the wilfulness of others. 
Listen, Jeff Mallory. The.no-space 
transmitter can be used in more 
than one fashion. It will remove 
me — and you as well — to a place 
of safety far from here. There I 
will make my report. The planet 
will be sterilized, robbing the 
Mone of their prize and — ” 

“You plan to run out, in other 
words. Isn’t that what you ac- 
cused Algoric of?” 



116 




“This world is doomed. Had we 
acted in time we might have 
saved it — but that time has passed. 
We can do nothing now. And as 
for myself — I’m dying. Your ar- 
rival was a miracle, the only small 
stroke of fortune that’s come to 
me in all my long exile. But once 
on the other side I can live again, 
restored to full vigor! What will be 
accomplished by my remaining 
here to die, sick and alone?’’ 

“The holes in your story show, 
Old Man,’’ Mallory said. “Algoric 
was the villain of the piece, eh? 
He wanted to run out — but you 
were true-blue?’’ 

“I was faithful to my duty — ” 

“Is that why you killed him?” 
“But — as I said — he escaped — ” 
“His dead body is lying in the 
front hall, Gonyl. There’s a strange 
thing about that corpse. It’s 
dressed in old-fashioned clothes. 
And he was still young — and you 
aren’t. I think you were the one 
who was locked out, Gonyl. I 
think he let you in because you 
swore you came to help — and af- 
ter you got inside you shot him — 
perhaps by accident — and then 
realized too late that you were 
still trapped because he’d locked 
everything in the station against 
you.” 

For a moment Gonyl’s face 
twisted as if torn by conflicting 
forces. Then he uttered a snarling 
laugh. 

“Very well. What does it mat- 



ter now? You’ve guessed a part of 
the truth — but I robbed Algoric 
of the sweetest fruit of his folly. I 
fled and took his woman with me. 
She bore his child and died — so 
his victory was a hollow one. But 
all that is past, long past. Into the 
transmitter — come, a whole new 
world waiting, a glory you can’t 
conceive!” 

“I suppose he called you as soon 
as he detected the Mone’s ap- 
proach. He thought that now, 
with the enemy on the way, you’d 
be willing to bury the hatchet, do 
the job you came for. But you 
were still thinking only of your 
own skin.” 

“Lies!’’ Gonyl howled. “And 
while you evolve these fantasies 
our moments of opportunity drib- 
ble away like wine from a leaky 
flagon!’’ 

“I think in that last moment, 
when he knew he was dying, he 
called to me,’’ Mallory went on. 
“That’s what brought me out of 
my coma, brought me here. Now 
you’re ready to use me to help 
you escape and never mind the 
fate of six billion human beings.” 

“You said six billion humans? 
Jeff Mallory, you don’t know — you 
haven’t yet grasped the situa- 
tion—” 

“I’ve grasped enough of it to 
know that as long as there’s one 
forlorn chance of stopping this 
cancer before it’s too late, I’m go- 
ing to take it.” 



THESEEDS OF GONYL 



117 




“But — Jeff Mallory — there is 
no human race to save. Surely you 
know! The first act of the Mone 
Pod on picking a breeding site is 
to broadcast a killing gas which 
wipes the planet clean of organic 
life except in the protected area 
of the nest. The people of your 
city of Beatrice live as mindless 
slaves of the Mone. All the rest, 
Jeff Mallory, are dead!” 

I T SEEMED to Mallory that he 
stood for a long time stunned, 
his thoughts groping over the 
shattering concept of a murdered 
planet, of cities filled with corpses, 
of deserted farms and airports 
and silent factories and drifting 
ocean liners — groped, unable to 
come to grips with so vast a di- 
saster. 

“Now you see why we must 
make haste to save ourselves,” 
Gonyl was saying. “Join me, Jeff 
Mallory. I’ll show you wonders to 
make the proudest capitals of this 
dreary world seem no more than 
the wattle huts of savages.” 

“All dead?” Mallory said. “All 
but my home town? But still — a 
few thousand people are enough 
to start with again. There’s still a 
chance.” 

“Their minds are gone,” Gonyl 
shrilled. “They died, too, in a 
more ghastly way than the billions 
who coughed once and knew no 
more. Death will be a mercy to 
them — ” 



“Not while I’m alive,” Mallory 
said — and staggered as a phan- 
tom blow struck at his brain, this 
time with massive power. 

It was as though a steel glove 
had gripped his mind, were crush- 
ing it, blanking out all thought 
except the command that rang 
like a trumpet in the turmoil. He 
felt himself driven back, felt his 
grip on reality dissolving. Vagrant 
memories flashed before his wan- 
ing consciousness — the walled-up 
door to Lori’s room; the pale 
tower rising in the city; Sally’s up- 
turned face; the wild eyes of 
Brother Harmony; the old house, 
standing dark and silent in the 
night — flashed and were gone. 

One image lingered, dim and 
unsubstantial: the figure of Un- 
cle Al, tall and commanding in the 
moonlight that streamed through 
the window. 

You know what to do, Jeff lad. 
I’ve taught you . and you learned 
well . 

Mallory rallied, gathered him- 
self, with a quick, decisive effort 
broke through the shell envelop- 
ing his mind, turned on it, shat- 
tered it into a thousand frag- 
ments. 

Gonyl’s thin wail of despair 
rang in Mallory’s ears. He saw 
the ancient limbs jerk, sending 
the withered body over the edge 
of the cot to slam against the 
floor, saw the clawed hands reach 
out to scrabble at the threshold 



118 



IF 




of the goal he had sought for so 
long, saw the skeletal arm fait 
limp, the skull-head drop to rest 
against the floor. 

“Fool, and worse than fool,” 
Gonyl whispered. 

His eyelids fluttered, came to 
rest half open over glazed cor- 
neas. Looking down at the dead 
man, MaHory sensed that his last 
words had been directed, not at 
Mallory, but at himself. 

I T WAS all clear now — the en- 
tirety of the message so long ago 
impressed on the sleeping brain 
of a child by the man who had 
called himself Uncle A1 — Algoric, 
agent of a vast and distant civili- 
zation to which the highest cul- 
tures of Earth would seem as 
primitive as the first rude hearths 
of Neanderthals. And yet, to Al- 
goric this world had been more 
than a pawn in the game of Ga- 
lactic war. He had loved a woman 
here, loved her well enough to 
give her up in the cause of his 
duty to her planet. And after she 
had gone — thinking him dead — 
he had followed her in his mind, 
had known of the birth of her 
daughter. And after her death he 
had watched the development of 
the child, had seen her grow to 
womanhood, marry and bear a 
son. 

A son named Geoffry Mallory. 
From his place of exile Algoric 
had reached out with his mind to 



touch that of the infant — had 
visited him in dreams, walked 
with him through enchanted 
lands of light and shadow, had 
shown him the great Galactic 
civilization, taught him the his- 
tory of the long war with the crea- 
tures called Mone, revealed to 
him the secret of the station, 
taught him its uses, the keys and 
codes that would unlock its pow- 
ers. 

And more — he had informed 
him of the nature of the renegade 
Gonyl, warned him of the man’s 
hidden strengths and fatal weak- 
nesses and had prepared a trap. 

The no-space transmitter could 
not be activated without both 
portions of the code-complex. If 
the day came when one of the 
robot sensors in trans-Piutonian 
orbit screamed its alarm, Algoric 
knew he would have no choice but 
to call Gonyl back, permit him 
entry into the station. Perhaps, 
in the face of the evidence of the 
threat he had denied could ever 
exist, Gonyl would undergo a 
change of heart, forget his oath 
of vengeance, let down his guard 
and join with Algoric in transmit- 
ting the warning signal. Algoric 
had no choice but to trust him. It 
would be necessary for him to 
open his mind, drop all defenses; 
join in the creation of the com- 
plex mental pulse which alone 
would unlock the transmitter. 
And if in that moment Gonyl 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



119 




chose to strike — he would meet 
disappointment. 

With utmost delicacy Algoric 
prepared the booby trap within 
his own mind. He set up a pattern 
of mental forces that would, at 
the first hint of treachery, fire a 
killing pulse into his innermost 
ego-center. Instead of looting 
Algoric’s unprotected mind of its 
secret, Gonyl would find himself 
linked mind-to-mind with a 
corpse. 

And in that moment of total 
disorientation, before Gonyl could 
break the numbing contact with 
death — Algoric’s final command 
would imprint itself on the other’s 
mind, unknown and irresistible. 

Having completed his prepara- 
tions, Algoric had buried the en- 
tire Gestalt under a hypnotic 
command, leaving Mallory with 
only the superficial conscious 
memory of the dream visits of his 
“imaginary” uncle. 

Then he had waited. The years 
had passed. Mallory had grown 
to man’s estate, taken up his ca- 
reer, with oaly an occasional 
fleeting recollection of the shad- 
owy dream-figure of his child- 
hood. Until the day when Algoric, 
dying, sent out the call summon- 
ing Mallory to the station. 

Even then Algoric had withheld 
the final stroke. It was possible 
that in the eleventh hour Gonyl 
might recover his lost sense of the 
duty at which he had failed. If so, 



he would link with Mallory to 
transmit the warning message. If 
not — if, instead, he used this final 
opportunity to attempt to loot 
Mallory’s mind of the Algoric- 
symbol — then the overriding com- 
mand would come into effect. 

To Mallory: the order to strike, 
take the pattern from Gonyl’s 
mind. 

To Gonyl: the command to de- 
liver up the prize without a strug- 
gle. 

S TANDING alone in the trans- 
mitter chamber, Mallory 
looked with wonderment on the 
dazzling concept-structure that 
rose in his mind on command: the 
unified Galactic command code, 
both halves joined in a fusion 
that was more than the sum of 
the parts. 

He reached out along the inter- 
twining lines and planes of 
thought, touched the transmitter 
control. Instantly the disk nar- 
rowed, closing in on itself until 
the original silvery globe rested 
on the squat pedestal. Another 
touch and the black portal opened 
wide again. 

The utter simplicity of the de- 
vice fascinated Mallory. A touch 
— so — and the globe would fold 
in on itself, its latent energies dis- 
solved in a single shaped pulse of 
no-space oscillation that would 
flash across half a galaxy to re- 
cord the alarm, pinpointing its 



120 



IF 




location on a minor world far out 
in the Galactic Arm. 

A different touch — so — and the 
energy configuration would re- 
form itself, become a matter 
transmitter of limited range, using 
no-space energies to thrust a ma- 
terial pulse across space at light- 
speed — a pulse consisting of the 
entity which was Jeff Mallory. 
He would sense no lapse of time, 
though years would pass before 
the quantum-bundle impinged on 
the receiving station on an arti- 
ficial planet a tenth of the way to 
Galactic Center. 

There he would deliver the 
news of the Mone investment of 
another world. Too late, then, to 
salvage the native population. A 
crew would be dispatched at once 
to deal with the tainted world — 
and Jeff Mallory would be alive, 
a free citizen of the glittering Ga- 
lactic society. 

It interested him to note that he 
had not the slightest impulse to 
avail himself of the latter oppor- 
tunity. Uncle Al’s instructions 
had been simple and imperative: 
relay the warning which would be 
instantaneously delivered and in- 
stantaneously acted on. In hours, 
the special-alert crew would ar- 
rive via no-space. If they were too 
late — if the Mone had already 
spawned — it would be necessary 
to mind-bomb the entire planet. 
If not, it would be sufficient to 
dissolve the Mone nest and steri- 



lize the planetary surface for a 
hundred miles around the center 
of infection. Despite Gonyl’s pro- 
nouncement that most of Earth’s 
populace was dead, insofar as 
Mallory knew, the spawning had 
not yet taken place. 

If he acted swiftly most of the 
planet would survive. 

Mallory looked at the gleaming 
sphere that waited for his com- 
mand to send the alarm flashing 
across space. He reached out and 
switched it off. It fell in on itself, 
dwindled to a blazing point of 
brilliance and died. 

“You counted on me, Uncle 
Al,” Mallory said aloud. “But 
I’m not a Galactic. I’m a poor, 
instinct-ridden primitive. You left 
me with two choices. I can’t take 
either of them.” 

M ALLORY left the house two 
hours later, after searching it 
from attic to subcellar. He had 
turned up nothing that might be 
useful as a weapon against the 
Mone but he had found a pair of 
good boots — of Galactic make — 
a warm coat, food. 

In early evening gloom he made 
his way back down through the 
dense shrubbery, emerged on the 
unsurfaced road he had followed 
coming in. The searchers were 
gone. No lights moved anywhere 
in the broad valley spreading be- 
low him. His present position, as 
well as he could estimate by dead 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



121 




reckoning, was some fifty miles 
northwest of Beatrice. He set off 
across an open field toward a dis- 
tant line of trees, impatient at the 
slow pace, wishing for a car. 

Time was running out — might 
have run out. Hundreds of billions 
of spores, Gonyt had said. Mal- 
lory scanned the skies, wondering 
what appearance such an out- 
pouring of alien seed would pre- 
sent. A gray cloud, spreading 
over the stars? A murky over- 
cast, rolling forward like a fog- 
bank at sea? 

But the sky was clear, swept 
clean by a bitter wind. Dry corn- 
stalks, unharvested, blanketed the 
ground, blown flat with their bur- 
dens of ripe ears by the winter 
winds. A doomed species, incapa- 
ble of reproducing its own kind 
now that the hand of man was 
gone. 

Next year a hardy crop of 
weeds would spring up all across 
the empty plains of the continent. 
Succeeding years would bring 
new varieties and in half a cen- 
tury the old grasslands would 
have reclaimed their own. The 
wild cattle and horses grazing 
there would burgeon enormously 
and the timid bison, brought 
back from the brink, would again 
darken the plains with their num- 
bers. And the gaunt timber 
wolves, emerging from the re- 
mote wilds of the north, would 
run in packs, pulling down the 



weak and the lame and the aged 
and the very young. And it would 
be as if man had never been. 

And even that picture, Mallory 
reflected, was an optimistic one, 
presupposing that plant and ani- 
mal life would somehow survive 
the invasion and/or the Galactic 
counterattack. Hundreds of bil- 
lions of creatures, matured from 
the broadcast spores, would blan- 
ket the world like a plague, build- 
ing toward the critical numbers 
that would trigger the next broad- 
casting of seed pods to race across 
space to infect the next ring of 
worlds. Was there any stopping of 
such voracious fecundity? Was the 
battle in vain, doomed before it 
was joined? 

He did not know, would never 
know. Out there— across light- 
years, across ages, the war had 
raged. A war— or a vast Galactic 
pest-control program. It was a 
thought that seemed to reduce 
all human struggle and aspiration 
to the minuscule level of the buzz- 
ing of bees in a hive. How hum- 
bling to the vaulting spirit of 
earthly man if he found himself 
destroyed in the overkill of a Ga- 
lactic Flit Gun. 

A road ran behind the line of 
trees. Mallory crossed it, tra- 
versed a patch of dark woods, 
came upon a dirt track leading in 
the correct direction. He tramped 
on. About midnight he paused to 
rest under a tree before an empty 



122 



IF 




farmhouse where a gutted con- 
vertible squatted on flat tires. An 
hour later he encountered a 
stalled car in the road, the badly 
decomposed corpse of a man 
slumped behind the wheel visible 
through the cloudy glass. He told 
himself that there was no point in 
opening the door and trying the 
starter — the battery would be 
long dead. 

Three miles farther, in front of 
a deserted gas station, he found 
four cars. One, an elderly Ford 
with a manual shift, gave a faint 
groan as he tried the starter. The 
road had a gentle downward 
grade at that point. With diffi- 
culty he manhandled the vehicle 
out onto the apron, jumped in, 
coasted downhill, let out the 
clutch. The engine fired, sput- 
tered and caught. 

Mallory covered twelve miles 
before running out of gas. He left 
the car on the shoulder, walked on 
into the outskirts of a lightless 
town announced by a faded sign 
as Beaver Crossing. He passed 
empty houses, the dry leaves 
drifting the street crunching un- 
derfoot. There was a sidewalk be- 
side the main street. His dim re- 
flection paced beside him in the 
dusty windows of abandoned 
shops. A block of buildings had 
burned. The acrid odor of charred 
timber still clung to the blackened 
remains of collapsed buildings. 

There was a small automotive 



repair shop in the next block. As 
Mallory paused to cast a specula- 
tive eye over the vehicles packed 
inside the closed garage, two men 
in khaki uniforms with the shoul- 
der patch of Strang’s army 
stepped out from a doorway and 
aimed rifles at his chest. One put 
a flashlight on his face. 

“It’s about time,’’ Mallory 
said. “I was beginning to think 
you’d never make your move.’’ 

O NE of the two men was a 
stranger to Mallory; the other 
was a tall, big-wristed fellow he 
had seen during his stay in camp. 
The latter held the light on him 
while the other frisked him awk- 
wardly, declared him clean. 

“You made a mistake hanging 
around here, boy,” the familiar 
one said. “Sarge will be pleased 
to see you again. He was kind of 
put out when you left without say- 
ing so long.” 

They prodded him along to a 
dusty jeep parked around the cor- 
ner, .drove at breakneck speed 
along bumpy back roads that 
brought them up to the encamp- 
ment gate in half an hour. The 
dirt streets were full of armed 
men carrying packs and rifles 
and being lined up and counted 
off by tense-looking NCO’s. 
There were floodlights beyond the 
camp, along the edge of the pas- 
ture. Mallory heard the rumble 
of big engines warming up. 

The jeep made its way through 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL

the throng, turned down an alley 
between dark cook tents, fmlled 
up before the barbed-wire en- 
closed stockade. 

“I don’t have time for this,” 
Mallory said. ‘‘I have to see 
Strang, fast.” 

“Not tonight, chum — the colo- 
nel’s busy tonight. What we got 
to do — we got to lock you up and 
get you off our hands. There’ll 
just be the one man to watch the 
compound. Kudnik. He’s got a 



sprained ankle but he’s damn 
good with that ought-three-oh. 
His order’ll be to plug you if you 
just look at the fence. Come on. 
Out!” 

“What’s going on?” 

One of the men caught Mal- 
lory’s arm, hauled him out of the 
jeep. 

“Tonight’s the night we hit 
Beatrice, Bud. The Chinks’ll 
think it’s World War Four. They 
won’t know what caught ’em.” 









“Don’t waste time, Gus,” the 
other man said, giving Mallory a 
rough shove toward the guard 
shack. 

Mallory half closed his eyes, 
feeling out gingerly for the mind- 
glow of the man. He sensed it, 
studied it, then probed gently. 

“We got orders — ” the man 
was saying. 

His voice faltered. He came to 
a halt, stood uncertainly, as if not 
sure in which direction to go.

» 

Mallory turned his attention to 
the other man, was caught by 
surprise as he saw the gun coming 
swiftly up. 

He struck. 

The man dropped the gun, fell 
forward on his face and lay with- 
out moving. 

Mallory turned quickly to the 
first man, who was blinking his 
eyes dazedly, shaking his head. 

“You were going to take me to 
the colonel,” he said urgently. 
“No time to waste.” 

“Yeah — sure,” the man said 
blurrily. “Come on.” 

Without a glance at his fallen 
comrade he led the way toward 
the main house. 

S TRANG stared hard at Mal- 
lory, motioned to a chair. 
“Well, I hope you had a nice 
stroll around the countryside, 
Mallory,” he said in tones of 
heavy sarcasm. He narrowed his 
eyes. “See anything interesting 
out there?” 

“Enough. Strang, you’ve got to 
call this raid off.” 

“Oh? Anything else?” 

“Plenty. Among other things, I 
found a man who’s seen the Mone 
— the aliens.” 

“Anybody I know? Where is 
he?” 

“He’s dead.” 

“Oh? Too bad. In that case, 
I’m afraid I’ll just have to go 
ahead — ” 

125 




“That’s not all, Strang. I now 
know what the Mone are,” Mal- 
lory said. 

Strang sighed. “I was hoping 
you’d be over that one.” 

“The Mone,” Mallory said, 
“are a life form about halfway be- 
tween organic machines and what 
we think of as living creatures. 
They aren’t precisely what we’d 
call intelligent. Their actions are 
directed by a kind of super-in- 
stinctive pattern — like insect be- 
havior but a thousand times more 
complex and with a few dozen 
million years of evolution behind 
them.” 

Strang slapped the desk with 
both hands. 

“Damn it, man, knock off this 
crank talk. I don’t know what 
you’re trying to prove — but it’s 
not working. You’re no more 
crazy than I am. I need every 
good man — ” 

“There’s a time element in- 
volved, Strang. The Mone pattern 
is to pick their spot and build in 
effect a nest — using local labor to 
help. When everything’s ready 
their queen, or brood sow or 
whatever you want to call her, 
settles down to spore production. 
The whole hive is directed toward 
feeding and supporting her while 
she gestates a few hundred billion 
germ cells. They’re broadcast 
when the time is ripe. That’s 
what the tower is for. The spores 
are microscopic. They’re fired all 



the way into the stratosphere and 
spread out to blanket the planet. 
In a few weeks they’ve settled in, 
found food supplies — ” 

“That’s enough!” Strang 
roared. “By God, Mallory, I 
promised Lori — ” He broke off, 
took a deep, calming breath. 
“I’ve had a talk with your daugh- 
ter — a fine young woman in 
whom I have implicit confidence 
— and I gave her my word I’d give 
you every opportunity to show 
me that you deserve a place on 
my staff. I need officers, Mallory. 
I need — ” 

“You need to listen to me, 
Strang. I came here to tell you 
what I’ve found out and to enlist 
your cooperation. I — ” 

“Came here, hell. You were 
marched here at gunpoint, at my 
orders. You cost me valuable 
gasoline and man-hours beating 
the brush for you.” 

“If I’d wanted to stay lost, do 
you really think I’d have walked 
right up to your picket line? Start 
thinking straight, Strang. I came 
back here, as I said, to tell you 
something. Suppose you listen be- 
fore you waste the pitch on me?” 
“I’m not interested in your 
ravings, Mallory. I was willing to 
let bygones be bygones for Lori’s 
sake. But — n 

“The spawning could take 
place at any time, Strang — any 
hour, any minute. Once that’s 
happened, it’s all over. If even

IF 




one per cent of the spores survive 
— and they have a fantastic sur- 
vival rate — in a few weeks there’ll 
be billions of them infesting every 
square inch of the planet. They’re 
tough, strong — not intelligent but 
effective in their own way — and 
they have just one objective: 
breeding more of their kind. 
They—” 

“All right, that’s enough.” 
Strang came to his feet. “You’ve 
taken this line and you’re stuck 
with it. Fine. If you’d rather swab 
pots and pans than help me plan 
strategy — ” 

Both men turned as a side door 
to the room opened. Lori came in, 
looking pale but determined in a 
tailored khaki uniform. 

“Dad — I’ve been listening to 
what you’ve been saying. I — I 
can’t believe you’re insane. So 
there must be some other reason 
for your ravings. I don’t know 
what it is and I don’t want to 
know. But I’m appealing to 
you — ” 

“Wait, Lori. I’d like to take the 
time to convince you you ought to 
listen to me, that what I’m telling 
you is true, to go into the matter of 
proof — but I can’t. I came here 
because I want help in what I’m 
going to do.” 

“What are you planning, Dad?” 

“I’m going into Beatrice and do 
what I can against what’s there. A 
few good men with guns would 
help.” 



Lori’s face was tense, wooden. 
She turned to Strang. 

“I’m sorry, James,” she whis- 
pered. “I was wrong. I withdraw 
my request. I release you from 
your promise. Do — whatever you 
must.” 

She turned quickly and reached 
for the door. 

“Wait,” Mallory said softly. 
The girl grasped the knob, pushed 
the door open — and paused. 

It's like reaching out with a gen- 
tle hand to the softly glowing in- 
tricacy that was a living mind , 
touching it delicately . 

Lori turned, a faintly bemused 
expression on her face. Not look- 
ing at either of the two men, she 
went to a chair, sat down carefully, 
folded her hands in her lap. Mal- 
lory went to the open door, closed 
it on the curious face of the sentry 
posted outside. 

“I’m glad you’ve decided to 
hear me out, Lori,” he said. “I’ll 
make this short and to the point, 
Colonel. I’m going into Beatrice. 
I want your army with me — all of 
it — armed and briefed for a hell of 
a fight.” 

Strang snorted. But before he 
could speak, Mallory went on: 
“Nobody will get sick, Colonel. 
There may be a bout of nausea as 
we go through the outer protective 
field but it won’t be fatal. Once in 
the city, no civilians are to be mo- 
lested. The enemy won’t be hard 
to identify — they’re alien. You’ll

understand as soon as you see 
one.” 

“You’re raving, Mallory. I’m 
hitting Beatrice, yes — but not 
with infantry. I have half a dozen 
tow planes and more cargo gliders 
than I need — and plenty of high 
explosives. I’ll fly half a dozen 
sorties over the town and pound it 
flat. Then I order my armor in. 
The Chinks won’t know what hit 
them—” 

“Colonel, I’ve told you the city 
is full of innocent non-combat- 
ants — ” 

Strang’s hand reached for the 
intercom button on his desk. 

Mallory struck quickly, without 
thinking. 

Strang’s face went chalky white. 
He made a strangled sound and 
fell sideways from his chair. Lori 
uttered a horrified cry. Mallory 
whirled as she came out of the 
chair, her eyes straining wide, her 
mouth ready for the scream. 

He touched her with a sSvift, 
controlled thought. She sank back 
into the chair, sat awkwardly, her 
face slack and amazed. 

Mallory bent over Strang. The 
unconscious man was breathing 
hoarsely. His face was flushed. 
Mallory lifted him into his chair, 
then probed delicately. 

He saw the point of impact, an 
area of dimness in the surrounding 
glow. With a gentle precision he 
reactivated the energy flows, saw 
the stunned portion of the man’s 



mind begin to warm back toward 
consciousness. 

S TRANG stirred, raised his 
head, focused his eyes on Mal- 
lory. Lori moaned softly. 

“Listen to me, both of you,” 
Mallory said in a flat, clipped 
voice, looking from one to the 
other. “You’ve just encountered 
something outside your experience. 
Accept it, recognize the fact that 
there’s something here you don’t 
understand. Your picture of reality 
was wrong in one respect?— it 
could be wrong in others.” 

“How — how did you move that 
fast?” Strang asked uncertainly. 
“It was like a snake striking.” 

“I haven’t moved,” Mallory 
said. “Tell him, Lori.” 

Her expression was stricken. 
“He — didn’t move at all, James. 
You just collapsed. I thought — ” 
“He’s all right,” Mallory said 
quickly. “I’m sorry, Lori. I had no 
choice.” 

“Who — what are you?” Mal- 
lory’s daughter stared at him with 
an expression of horror. “I felt 
something — inside my skull — ” 

She clamped her hands to the 
sides of her head. 

“I’m your father, Lori,” he said 
harshly. “I wish I had time to take 
you along slowly, explain it all to 
you in detail, coax you to under- 
stand — to trust me. But I don’t. 
Just face the fact that there’s more

to what I’m saying than a mani- 
ac’s fancies.” He turned to Strang. 
“You’re a military man, Colonel, 
a realist. When the first A-bomb 
hit Hiroshima the Japanese might 
not have understood what hap- 
pened — but they couldn’t ignore 
the results. I’m asking you to ac- 
cept the fact that I know some- 
thing you don’t. I’m asking you to 
take me on trust, give me the men 
I need.” 

“You’re crazy,” Strang said, 
making an effort to pull himself 
together. “Crazy men sometimes 
have superhuman strength; may- 
be they have superhuman speed, 
too—” 

“I told you — Lori told you — I 
hit you with my mind, not my 
fist.” 

“All right — suppose you did 
what you claim. What’s that got 
to do with sending my troops into 
a plague area?” 

Mallory leaned on the desk with 
both fists. “There’s no plague. 
There is an occupying force. At 
the present moment there are only 
a few hundred of them — the 
workers who protect and feed the 
Queen Mone. We can take them, 
Strang. At least we have a chance. 
If we don’t act now — today — it 
may be too late.” 

Mallory saw the change in 
Strang’s expression; he reached, 
touched lightly. Strang lurched 
backward, uttered a gargling 
groan, clapped a hand to his head. 



Mallory turned to see Lori on her 
feet. 

“Lori — for God’s sake don’t 
push me.” 

“No — not God’s sake. I don’t 
know what- this is — what terrible 
power you have — but — ” 

Strang was struggling up. 

“Wait, damn it,” Mallory said 
urgently. “Hear me out — ” 

Lori moved toward him. He 
brushed her mind lightly. She 
staggered, caught herself. Strang 
had come around the end of the 
desk. 

“He can’t handle both of us at 
once,” he said in a low, taut voice. 
“Lori, get out of the room, call — ” 
Mallory touched her again as 
she started for the door. She went 
to her knees. He hit Strang as the 
man charged him, stepped aside as 
he fell. 

“I can handle you, Strang,” 
Mallory said. “By knocking you 
out. But that won’t help. I need 
you conscious — both of you.” 
“Looks like a stand-off,” Strang 
said through clenched teeth. He 
was on all fours, shaking his head. 
Mallory went to Lori, lifted her. 

“Please— I’m begging you. 
Listen, then judge.” 

“I — all right. Dad,” Lori said 
in a whisper, and pulled herself 
away. “I suppose we haven’t any 
choice.” 

LL RIGHT,” Strang said 
fifteen minutes later. “I’ve

firms my conviction that you’re

“Wait, James,” Lori spoke up. 
“What Dad says does explain 
some things. If it were possible — ” 
“But since it isn’t,” Strang cut 
in harshly, “we can — ” 

“How do you know what’s pos- 



sible, Strang?” Mallory broke in. 
“Or do you know? Aren’t you just 
guessing? Damn it, think like a 
tactician. If the opposition comes 
up with something brand new, do 
you deny it— or deal with it?

“I’ve told you the conse- 
quences.” 

“And I’ve told you no, damn 
it.” 

Mallory nodded. 

“All right,” he said. “I wish I 
could take over your mind and 
force you to issue orders but I’m 
not that good. Maybe I will be 
some day — if I live. I haven’t be- 
gun to explore what I have.” He 
turned to Lori. “I’m sorry, Lori. 
Sorry I couldn’t make you under- 
stand. Maybe some day you will.” 
He strode to the door, looked back 
at Strang. “Don’t try to stop me, 
Colonel. Under pressure I might 
hurt someone. I just don’t know 
enough about the mind to control 
it.” 

“Where are you going?” Lori 
blurted. 

“Where I said I was going, 
Lori.” 

“Alone?” 

“It looks that way.” 

“James — you can’t let him. 
He’ll die. And if he is right — ” 
“How can I stop him?” 

“You can give him some men — 
a few men. Something. You have 
to do something, James!” 

Strang stared hard at Mallory. 
“Would one man help?” 



Mallory nodded. Strang 
punched his intercom key. 

“Tell Brozhny to come in.” 

They waited in silence. In less 
than a minute the door opened to 
admit the Russian. 

“You’re in temporary com- 
mand,” Strang said. “Hold the 
attack until I come back.” 

“James — you’re not going your- 
self?” Lori burst out. “It’s too 
dangerous — ” 

“What do you want me to do, 
girl — send another mafl to take 
my risks for me?” 

“But James — you’re the leader.” 
“Vass can handle it.” Strang 
turned to Mallory. “How close do 
you have to be to see the tower?” 
“Five miles, maybe.” 

.“All right. Five miles. And if 
there’s no tower — we’ll both forget 
this story of yours. Agreed?” 

“And if there is?” 

“Then possibly I’ll have a little 
rethinking to do.” 

“Then you’ll go a little farther?” 
“How far?” 

“Far enough to see proof of the 
rest of what I’ve said.” 

Strang nodded, caught the Rus- 
sian officer’s eye. 

“If I’m not back by sundown 
tomorrow — it’s all yours. And 
Vass, when you take the bombers 
in — if you see a tower hit it first.” 
“As you wish, Colonel.” 

“All right, Mallory,” Strang 
said. “Let’s go have a look at these 
little green men of yours.”

“Not little,” Mallory said. “Not 
green. And not men.” 
waved and, with a scatter of gravel, 
IX 

S ALLY, her right arm heavily 
bandaged and carried in a 
sling, and Lori, stiff-faced but 
tearless, stood by silently as Mal- 
lory and Strang stowed their rifles 
and supplies in the Jeep. 

Strang started the engine, 
waved and , with a scatter of gravel, 
gunned down the winding drive. 
He opened up on the highway 
straddling the faded yellow center- 
line. 

“Mallory, I’ve been thinking 
about your story,” he called over 
the buffeting of the wind. “Trying 
to put my finger on all the logical 
flaws in it. Funny thing is — I have 
to admit it’s damned ingenious — 
once you get past the basic prem- 
ise. Accounts for everything. It 
worries me a little, Mallory. Your 
being nuts is a lot easier for me to 
handle than an invasion from 
space.” 

“If ypu don’t see what I told 
you you’d see I’ll go back and en- 
list for the duration,” Mallory 
said curtly. “In the meantime, 
let’s let it go at that.” 

For the next half hour Strang 
drove at breakneck speed, slowing 
only when necessary to skirt a 
stalled car or tank. They passed a 
sign announcing Beatrice in ten 
miles. Mallory took deep breaths 



to quiet an unease in his midriff 
that was rapidly growing toward 
burning nausea. Strang was frown- 
ing fiercely. He drove on two more 
miles, then slowed. 

“I don’t like this, Mallory,” he 
said. His tanned face was sallow 
and sweat beaded his forehead. 
“Damn it, man, the air is poison- 
ous. It’s making me sick to my 
stomach.” 

“I told you about this effect,” 
Mallory said. “It’s not plague, 
Strang. It’s a protective field de- 
signed to keep out any interlopers 
who survived the killing and es- 
caped the hypnosis.” 

“You’ve got an answer for ev- 
erything.” 

“Is that supposed to prove I’m 
wrong?” 

“Damn it, man, you’ve got to be 
wrong. Otherwise — ” 

“Drive on, Colonel. Prove I’m 
wrong. We ought to see it any 
time now. Maybe around that 
next bend.” 

"Sure. You’ll point and say, 
There it is.’ And I’ll take a look 
and won’t see a damned thing.” 

“You’ll see the tower. Sally told 
you they could see it on a fair day 
from the farm.” 

“They saw searchlights, that’s 
all.” 

“Colonel, quotes, you’ve got an 
answer for everything,” Mallory 
said sardonically. 

Strang gunned the jeep sav- 
agely. 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL

“Sure, but my answers make 
sense.” 

The vehicle topped a low rise of 
ground. Ahead lay a cluster of 
crossroads gas stations. Beyond 
were scattered houses, the begin- 
nings of the first outlying suburb 
of Beatrice. The jeep slowed. 

Strang gripped the wheel, his 
face taut, staring toward the misty 
green column rising above the 
roofs across the plain. He braked 
to a stop, unstrapped himself, un- 
slung the binoculars from his hip, 
adjusted them, stood for half a 
minute in the jeep, studying the 
scene. He lowered the glasses, re- 
sumed his seat. His tongue 
touched his lips. 

“Yeah,” he said abruptly. 
“Let’s go take a closer look, Mal- 
lory.” 

He eased the jeep into gear and 
drove more slowly. 

S TRANG halted the car in the 
shade of a strand of leafless 
sycamores beside an elderly, sag- 
ging house just outside the CITY 
LIMITS sign. 

“It’s quiet,” he said. “Damned 
quiet — and no corpses.” 

He climbed out of the jeep, 
stood with his head cocked, listen- 
ing to the utter stillness. 

“All right, you see the town,” 
Mallory said. “And no Chinese 
Communists. Now let’s get out.” 
“Damn it, Mallory, you don’t 
expect me to go back and tell 



Brozhny I’ve bought your whole 
story on the basis of a building 
that maybe looks a little different 
from what you’d expect to see in a 
prairie town. Let’s take a little 
walk.” 

“This isn’t a good idea, Strang. 
This is enemy territory.” 

“I want to see all there is to see.” 
“All right, but remember what 
I told you. If you have to use that 
gun aim for the navel — or where 
the navel would be if you were 
shooting at a human.” 

They walked along past the 
empty house, an abandoned gas 
station. 

“It all looks so damned normal, 
Mallory,” Strang said, an almost 
pleading note in his voice. “All 
but that damned tower.” 

“You’ll even see lawn sprinklers 
working,” Mallory said. “And 
milk bottles on back porches. 
They’re trying to create a normal 
environment for their workers and 
they don’t know what’s impor- 
tant. They reason like a boy put- 
ting a grasshopper in a bottle with 
six different kinds of weeds.” 
“Hold it.” Strang’s hand shot 
out to block Mallory. “Listen.” 

The sound of a distant engine 
running raggedly, as if it were be- 
ing started up after a long period 
of idleness, reached them. 

“Time to go,” Mallory said, 
speaking softly. 

“Aliens,” Strang said. “Flying 
saucerites from another planet.

They settle in a small town, take 
over our shapes, our houses, our 
cars — and start a factory. Nuts.” 
He said the last word flatly, with- 
out intonation. “I don’t believe 
any of it, Mallory. Come on. Let’s 
nab the mayor or the chief of 
police or whoever the hell is in 
charge here and find out what’s 
going on.” 

He started forward. Mallory 
caught his arm. 

“Wait a minute, Strang. I 
brought you here to show you 
something, not to get you killed. 
The city’s occupied by the enemy 
—can’t you get that into your 
mind? Now, let’s get out of here 
and come back loaded for bear.” 

“Damn it, man — it looks as if 
this city lived through the Chink 
attack by the grace of God — and 
if you think — ” 

“I think it’s time to go back, 
Strang.” 

“I haven’t seen enough.” 

He froze to listen to the sound of 
an engine approaching swiftly. 

“Get behind that signboard — 
fast,” Mallory rapped. 

“Wait a minute. Maybe — ” 

Mallory sprinted for conceal- 
ment. Strang followed him pres- 
ently. They lay flat, watching a 
white bread truck come into view, 
slow, swing the corner, approach 
the sign. It stopped in the middle 
of the street a hundred feet away. 
Two men stepped down, stood at- 
tentively, as if listening. 



“Those are men, not monsters,” 
Strang whispered. “I want to talk 
to them, find out — ” 

Mallory caught his arm. 

“If you saw them up close you 
wouldn’t think they’re men. And 
we’re not going to get that close.” 
Mallory turned at a sound. A 
tall man in a gray coverall was ap- 
proaching across the lot, walking 
with a curious, shambling gait. 

“You get your wish,” Mallory 
said. “Stand still. Maybe we can 
bluff our way through.” 

Strang eyed the oncoming fig- 
ure, fingering his rifle. 

“For God’s sake, Mallory,” he 
said in a low voice. “The fellow’s 
as human as I am — even if he 
does walk as if he had two artificial 
legs.” 

“He has,” Mallory said flatly. 
“Don’t say anything. Just be 
ready.” 

S TRANG made a disgusted 
sound, rose to his feet, his eyes 
on the stranger. Mallory stood be- 
side him. The figure stopped ten 
feet away, stood in a curiously 
lifeless stance, body poised at an 
awkward angle. At this distance 
the doughy textures of skin and 
garments were obvious. The face 
was a mask painted with flat colors 
on porous rubber. 

“Mother of God,” Strang whis- 
pered. 

“Why are you not at your 
benches?” the simulacrum in-

quired in the unctious tones of a 
television pitchman and, without 
waiting for a reply, advanced on 
Strang. The colonel took a step 
back, set the butt of the rifle 
against his hip and fired. The shot 
was deafening; pale flame spurted. 
The impact of the bullet spun the 
creature — it regained its balance, 
resumed its advance, a pit the size 
of an olive gaping high in its 
chest. 

“It will be necessary to give you 
pain,” it said. 

Mallory brought his rifle to his 
shoulder, fired, rode the kick, fired 
again. The effigy stumbled, fell 
face forward with a sound like a 
mattress striking the ground. 

Strang aimed his rifle at its 
head. Mallory caught the muzzle, 
thrust it aside. 

“That way,” he snapped and 
shoved Strang. 

The two men sprinted across an 
open field, between two garages, 
through a gap in a hedge. They 
emerged in a narrow alley behind 
a warehouse. The white vehicle 
was visible at the corner, catching 
up rapidly. 

“They must have detected us as 
soon as we got into their screens,” 
Mallory said as they ducked back. 
“We walked right into it.” 

“Not human,” Strang muttered. 
His face was a strange, blotchy 
color. “My God — like a rag doll — 
walking and talking. Those 
eyes — ” 



“We’re within a block of the 
jeep,” Mallory said. “We’ll let 
this car pass, then run for it.” 

Crouched in deep shadow be- 
side the house, Mallory felt a 
wave of dizziness pass over him. 
For a moment the scene faded, as 
if a transparent curtain of spar- 
kling black silk had dropped 
down around him. Voices seemed 
to clamor at him from a distance. 
They had a strange urgency. 

With an effort he squeezed his 
eyes shut, shook his head. He took 
a deep breath, gathered his fad- 
ing consciousness, focused it. 

He was on all fours, listening to 
a distant humming that faded, 
died, as color washed back into 
the scene. An engine was idling 
nearby. Footsteps sounded, com- 
ing closer. 

“Strang,” Mallory whispered. 
“Get set. As soon as he’s past, we 
duck out and run like hell — ” 

A shadow fell across a patch of 
sunny lawn. A man in Western 
costume, complete with cowboy 
hat and holstered guns, paced past 
their hiding place. His footsteps 
receded. 

“Let’s go.” 

Mallory came to his feet, 
glanced back as Strang failed to 
move. The colonel stood against 
the wall, the rifle in his hands 
pointing at the ground. 

“Strang — snap out of it.” 

Strang’s eyes had a glazed, out- 
of-focus look. Mallory caught his 



136 



IF 




arm. Strang blinked at him vague- 

ly- 

“Release me,” he said toneless- 
ly. “I must — my work — ” 

“Strang — they’ve gotten to you. 
Fight it, man. Throw it off.” 

Strang pushed at him, strug- 
gled to free himself. His move- 
ments were uncoordinated, clum- 
sy. Mallory caught his wrists. 

“Strang — remember Lori? Re- 
member your army, waiting for 
you to come back and lead the at- 
tack?” 

“The work waits.” 

Mallory felt the dizziness touch 
him again. This time he pushed it 
away more easily. With a sudden 
wrench, Strang tore himself free. 
He straightened, brushed at his 
khaki shirt. 

“Well, I have to be getting 
along,” he said briskly. “It’s time, 
you know. We’re all needed — ” 

Mallory closed his eyes, con- 
centrating. He sensed Strang’s 
mind-glow, dim and cramped, 
locked in a web of blackness. 
Gently, he probed, found an in- 
terstice, slipped inside. 

Strang — wake up . 

He sensed faint stirrings of 
alarm, of partial understanding, 
partial recognition. 

Mai — Mallory. Cant — think. 

Like — drowning in tar — cold — 
hurts — 

Mallory opened his eyes. Strang 
sagged against the building, his 
face pale, his mouth open. He took 



a shaky step and stumbled to his 
knees. Mallory heard returning 
footsteps. The car was coming 
closer. He reached again for 
Strang’s mind, forced Strang to 
totter to his feet. 

A DUMMY made of cheap 
plastic lunged into view six 
feet away. It pivoted, eyes staring 
fixedly, blankly. This time the 
Mone’s mental blow was sharp, 
precisely aimed. Mallory’s counter 
lanced out at the gleaming pin- 
point that was the other’s mind- 
field, clashed against alienness, 
absorbed a brief, shocking pain, 
then held and clung. He was per- 
ipherally aware of Strang stum- 
bling back against the wall, of the 
pseudoman standing frozen in 
mid-stride. He thrust harder, 
searching for entry through the 
other’s defenses, found a line of 
juncture, jabbed. 

Light exploded in his mind. He 
was in a vast room lit by a greenish 
light, filled with an alien stench, 
alien sounds. The space was al- 
most completely filled by a vast 
sponge-like structure of translu- 
cent cells, filaments and tubes — 
like the interior of a human lung 
seen under high magnification, 
the thought came to him. All 
around the central mass men and 
not-men hurried, involved in in- 
comprehensible tasks. Mallory 
sensed an air of extreme tension, 
of time stretched to the breaking 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



137 




point, of events swollen to burst- 
ing. 

It is the time. Now existence 
rushes toward fulfillment in the 
fruiting of the spore-body . 

With a violent effort, Mallory 
wrenched against the paralyzing 
contact with the Mone thought- 
field. He knew a sense of being 
torn, of a bubble bursting, a vessel 
smashed, of life-force seeping 
away. 

The not-man before him settled 
into a boneless squat, head dan- 
gling backward, hands flat, palms 
up, fingers fully extended. In 
death all humanity drained from 
the puppet, leaving it a thing de- 
flated of any semblance of life. 

“My God,” Strang said. “What 
— what was that? How — ” 

“It’s too late to go back now, 
Strang,” Mallory said swiftly. 
“Time has run out. The Mone is 
about to spawn — in minutes, may- 
be even seconds — ” 

Strang jerked as if a rope had 
been pulled. He took an awkward 
step, shuddered, stood straight. 

“Now we must go to our 
benches,” he said carefully, look- 
ing toward the great tower soaring 
above the rooftops. 

The sound of the vehicle engine 
was close, idling. Two not-men 
appeared, came toward them, ig- 
noring the dummy slumped in the 
path. 

“Now you must go to your 
benches,” the smaller, thinner one 



said in the voice of an earnest 
young pharmacist recommending 
a patent tranquilizer. 

“Yes,” Mallory said in a flat 
tone, “Now we must go to our 
benches.” 

Led by the not-men, with 
Strang striding confidently beside 
him, he walked out to the street 
and headed toward the tower. 

T HE downtown streets had the 
same derelict look they had 
had a week before. A few more 
papers were being blown along 
the sidewalks. More weeds had 
sprouted in the cracks in the 
pavement. Mallory’s footsteps 
had a hollow, echoing quality. 

The air was cool in the shadow 
of the tower. The gate in the wall 
opened as they came up. The flat 
ground beyond it was as hard and 
grassless as a school playground. 
A few not-men were moving with 
an air of compulsive haste. Off to 
one side a man lay on his face, his 
arms under him. His color indi- 
cated that he was dead. None of 
the not-men seemed to be aware of 
the corpse. 

Mallory and his escort passed 
through a rounded opening in the 
base of the tower into a curving 
chamber that suggested the in- 
terior of an immense seashell. The 
walls were a translucent, nacreous 
green, flaring up and over, bend- 
ing away until they were lost in 
green gloom. An acrid, kelplike 



138 



IF 




odor hung in the muggy air. He 
heard a persistent murmur of 
sound, like that of a restless crowd 
in an auditorium beyond closed 
doors. 

The two not-men who had con- 
ducted him and Strang here sepa- 
rated, one moving off to the right, 
the other continuing toward a 
small passage opening in the curve 
of wall. Strang unhesitatingly fol- 
lowed the latter. Mallory took the 
cue. The route led downward in a 
gentle spiral. There was no floor 
as such — in cross-section the pas- 
sage was nearly circular. A nar- 
row drift of dust and debris formed 
a ridge along the centerline. 

The light grew dimmer, the 
sounds louder, the odors more 
pungent. The passage opened into 
a wide room cut into a maze by a 
system of waist-high partitions 
that extended out of sight around 
a central core of dull, dark green. 
There were hundreds of people — 
Mallory saw familiar faces, drawn 
and haggard in the sickly light. 
Strang’s guide halted. Two figures 
were approaching, oddly colorless 
and amorphous. 

At close range Mallory saw that 
they were faceless, hairless ver- 
sions of the not-men he had seen 
above ground. Their bodies were 
smooth, featureless, a uniform dull 
gray in color. 

Mallory extended his awareness 
cautiously, contacted the pin-point 
brilliance of the mind-field of the 



not-man who had led him here, 
the brighter, more complex ema- 
nations of the newcomers. He was 
aware of a swift, flickering inter- 
change among them, then of a 
tentative probe at his own mind. 
For a moment he knew an intrud- 
ing sense of uncertainty. Then all 
three aliens turned abruptly and 
walked away. 

With the air of one who knows 
exactly where he is going Strang 
stepped through an opening in 
the low wall. Mallory followed. 

Inside he stopped, caught 
Strang’s arm. He closed his eyes, 
willed his consciousness outward. 
The glow that was Strang’s mind- 
field was almost obscured by an 
enveloping blanket of gray. Mal- 
lory stripped it away. Strang 
staggered, caught himself, looked 
around with an expression of be- 
wilderment. His eyes fell on Mal- 
lory. 

“We’re inside the tower,”, Mal- 
lory said quickly. “You’ve been 
unconscious. How do you feel?” 

“Godawful,” Strang muttered: 
“ Dream s — then — nothing — ” 

“We’re all out of time. We have 
to try to get to the spawning cham- 
ber. I’m guessing that will be cen- 
tral. We’ll play it by ear. Come 
on.” 

He strode along a narrow pas- 
sage. Strang followed. 

A low shelf lined the inner sur- 
face of the partition here. At inter- 
vals of a few feet men and women 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL

were posted — genuine men and 
women but dull-eyed, slack-fea- 
tured, thin and pale, their clothing 
in various degrees of neglect. It ap- 
peared, Mallory saw, to be an as- 
sembly line of sorts. He saw heaps 
of small objects resembling carved 
beans before each worker. They 
were being strung on wires. No 
one paid the slightest attention to 
the intruders. 

Mallory turned through an 
opening in the low wall, followed 
another aisle, lined like the 
others with toiling, blank-eyed 
men and women. He recognized a 
dentist who had once filled a 
molar for him. A complexly inter- 
twined rope was coiled on the 
counter before the man among 
scattered beans, some of which 
had spilled to the floor. 

Mallory reached out, plucked 
the work from his hands. The man 
hesitated only a moment — then he 
plucked a coil of the hair-fine 
black wire from the disorder, 
seized a bean, threaded it onto the 
wire. 

“Dr. Foyle,” Mallory said in a 
low voice. “Can you hear me?” 

Foyle gave a violent twitch. The 
bean fell from his fingers. He 
looked wildly at Mallory. 

“It is time,” he mumbled and 
turned back to his work, grabbing 
for a new bean with an air of fran- 
tic haste. 

Mallory reached carefully to 
touch the other’s mind — the 



pseudo-glow was barely percepti- 
ble, submerged under multiple 
layers of inhibiting anti-thought. 
Delicately, Mallory penetrated 
the maze, touched the paralyzed 
ego-center. Foyle’s hands froze on 
his work. 

I need your help , Foyle. I need 
information. Where is the spawn- 
ing chamber? How can I get to it? 

T HE former dentist’s head 
jerked. He put his hands to 
his head, made an ugly noise. 

“Get out — got to get out — get 
away — get — filthy thing — out of 
my head — ” 

Foyle’s voice rose on the last 
words. 

“Quiet,” Mallory whispered. “I 
want to help you.” 

“Late. No time. She’ll spawn 
now — in a matter of minutes — 
must — complete — ” 

Foyle grabbed for the beans. 
“Where is she? How can we get 
there? What can we do?” 

Foyle seemed to respond. He 
stared at Mallory. 

“Big room — Great Queen — 
God, the urge to let go — give in to 
it— loyalty to Green Queen — ” 
“Where is she, Foyle?” 

“Must — complete genetic pack- 
age — response — environment — 
modification. Almost ready — 
pressures — nutrients — ” 

“How do we reach the Queen’s 
chamber?” 

“She’s — almost ready. Need —

all genetic data. These — among — 
genes. I’m building chromosomes. 
They’re like — tapes, fed into her — 
into it! The horror — the beauty. 
Strange. Torn two ways. Must add 
my contribution to adaption — best 
chance for survival — second gen- 
eration — ” 

A hoarse, gargling sound came 
from Foyle’s mouth. He made an 
abortive attempt to rise, then fell 
forward over his bench. Mallory 
thrust to the center of his fading 
thought-glow, saw it collapsing in- 
ward under the unbearable pres- 
sure, saw it dwindle, wink out. 

“He’s dead,” he told Strang. 

They resumed their prowl along 
the curving aisle. Mallory reached 
out to scan the minds of the hu- 
mans as they huddled over their 
work, met only blankness co- 
cooned in fields of negative energy. 
Once a pseudo-human passed 
them, hurrying in the opposite di- 
rection. It was only a half-hearted 
counterfeit — the face was a blob, 
the garments vaguely outlined. 
Mallory felt the pale heat of its 
mental aura brush him. He held 
his barrier steady and the contact 
was past. 

The aisle dead-ended at a verti- 
cal wall of a gray, papery ma- 
terial. Strang examined it. 

“It doesn’t look very strong. 
Take a chance on kicking it in?” 

There were no not-men near. 
Strang felt over the surface, 
pushed at it, then swung his boot. 



The barrier split. Although work- 
ers were busy within six feet of 
them, none showed any awareness 
that anything unusual was taking 
place. 

Strang hammered the material 
back, dropped to all fours and 
crawled through. Mallory fol- 
lowed. 

They were in a long, narrow 
space. Ducts of lumpy and irregu- 
lar shape led through it, some 
branching upward, others down. 
There was a steady, drumming 
sound as of the flow of dense fluids 
driven by busy pumps. The far 
wall of the chamber was a glossy 
dark brown. The pipes that passed 
through it had no visible joints. 

Mallory tested the strength of 
the wall. It was as solid as armor 
plating. 

“We have to get past it,” he 
said. 

“We won’t make a hole in that.” 

Mallory was examining a duct 
two feet in diameter. 

“Check the input end?” 

They traced the pipe back. 
Thirty feet upstream it made a 
right angle turn to rise vertically, 
passing through an aperture in 
the ceiling. 

Strang set himself. Mallory 
stepped on his back, reached, 
caught a handhold and pulled 
himself up. The duct ended at a 
manifold, where four smallfer pipes 
came together. Mallory tested 
them, found an apparent struc- 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



141 




tural weakness at the point where 
the tributary lines entered the 
plenum chamber. 

He wrenched at one. It yielded 
slightly but did not fracture. 

He lay beside the hole, lowered 
an arm; Strang jumped, caught 
his hand, pulled himself up and 
through. Mallory took a position 
on one side of the duct, Strang on 
the other. They pushed, pulled, 
alternately, timing their pressures 
to the natural period of the pipe. 
The amplitude of the oscillations 
increased; with a ripping sound, 
the material parted at the point of 
juncture; dark green fluid gushed 
forth, splattering on the floor. 

They set to work on a second 
duct, tore it free, then a third. The 
last of the four came away easily, 
tearing the top of the plenum out 
with it. The floor was ankle deep 
in olive-drab muck that flowed 
down through the aperture 
through which they had entered, 
splattering on the floor below. 

Slowly, the level in the plenum 
sank. 

“We can’t wait,” Mallory said. 
“I’m going in.” 

“I’ll wait two minutes and fol- 
low you,” Strang said. 

M ALLORY lowered his legs 
into the viscous sump. The 
fluid was warm, lumpy, like thin 
gruel. He took a deep breath, re- 
leased his grip. The fluid rose 
around him, washed up over his 



face as he submerged. 

He sank slowly. The inside of 
the duct was smooth. He counted 
silently. At twenty-eight his feet 
struck a curving suface. He bent, 
slid down and around the right- 
angle turn. It was another thirty 
feet to the barrier wall. Mallory 
pushed ahead into the horizontal 
section, feet-first, paddling awk- 
wardly. 

By thrusting alternately against 
the side walls he was able to ac- 
celerate his progress. The fluid 
was moving with more force now 
— he sensed that the duct had nar- 
rowed. He had lost count of the 
time. Surely it had been more 
than a minute — his lungs burned; 
a rising blackness obscured his 
thoughts. In a moment he would 
have to breathe — but first another 
few yards — another few feet — one 
more foot. 

His shoulder thumped the side 
of the duct. Abruptly a swift cur- 
rent was sucking at him. He 
locked his throat, concentrated his 
waning control on the single con- 
cept of not allowing his lungs the 
convulsive filling they craved. 

The support dropped from be- 
neath him. The pressure was 
gone. He fell, struck, was sliding 
across a smooth floor, snorting to 
clear his mouth and nostrils of a 
cloying reek as of stale bread mul- 
tiplied a thousand times. He came 
to rest on his face, groping for 
traction on a slippery surface. 



142 



IF 




The air was steaming hot, filled 
with duckings and gurglings as of 
bubbling tar. It was difficult to 
breathe. Mallory coughed, spat 
pasty nutrient material from his 
mouth, cleared his eyes. The space 
in which he found himself was al- 
most totally dark. A faint glow 
from an obscure source showed 
him a vast, swollen, spongy mass 
that he had seen before in a dark 
vision gleaned from an alien mind. 

He reached out, sensed for a 
moment a play of pseudolight in 
patterns of not-color across a con- 
voluted surface of pure mind-stuff. 

Then an impact like an ice 
avalanche struck him, smashed 
him into dust, whirled the dust 
away into timeless infinity. 

H E DRIFTED in total black- 
ness, afloat on a sea of non- 
time, non-space. Far away, like 
memories of a forgotten child- 
hood, lights and sounds moved 
with the bustle and clamor of 
great events reaching crisis — but 
not here. He was alone, para- 
lyzed, without senses or sensa- 
tions. 

Except for the agonizing aware- 
ness of total defeat. 

Like a falling man, Mallory 
reached out for contact — for any 
point of reference with which to 
relate himself. 

He sensed a hint of texture, an 
impression of structure like the 
grain in wood. Pressure counter to 



the grain met total resistance. He 
tried to reorient himself, reach out 
parallel to the laminar polarity of 
the enveloping inhibitory field. 

H E BROKE out into a roaring 
cacyphony of sight/ smell/ 
sound /touch/— a blended kaleido- 
scope of multi-ordinal sense im- 
pressions that sleeted at him like 
interlaced blizzards of color, pitch, 
texture, stench. 

He could perceive a great, puls- 
ing glow that spread from zenith 
to nadir, aswarm with clustered, 
hurrying points of vivid white and 
other lesser but more variegated 
brilliances that stirred sluggishly, 
more distant from the nucleus of 
the array. 

In the flow and churn of pure 
energy below/ beside /around him 
he perceived an evolving pattern 
of interlocking complexity build- 
ing inexorably toward completion 
and consummation. Like a driver 
on a multilaned freeway, he as- 
sessed the shifting, jockeying flow 
of intermingling forces which 
maintained the developing but 
ever-balanced equation. 

He sensed the vast energies 
flowing, saw how they drew on the 
supportive structure provided by 
the lesser mind-fields of the ancil- 
lary Mone creatures — recognized 
the vast intellectual potential cre- 
ated by the linkage of lesser brains 
to create a superbrain of a capabil- 
ity that was the product, not the

sum, of the constituent parts. 

He scanned the lesser, dimmer 
individual thought-nexi which 
had been excluded from the com- 
pound mind, recognized them as 
the stunned, controlled minds of 
the human workers. In compari- 
son with the concentrated bril- 
liances of the not-men they seemed 
diffuse, unoriented. 

Unharnessed. 

In the instant the concept 
formed in his mind he knew what 
he must do. 

X 

M ALLORY visualized his 
physical body lying dead — 
or dying — on the feeding-cell floor. 
It required a major effort to re- 
orient his thinking to the limited 
dimensions of a physical brain in 
an organic body, to trace back 
along the tenuous linkage that 
bound him to the inert flesh, to 
shape himself again to conform to 
a matter-energy shell. He knew an 
instant of pressure, of constric- 
tion . 

Pain burned in him as if he had 
plunged into a ladle of molten 
metal. His lungs heaved. His 
heart gave a convulsive leap. His 
hands felt thick and numb. His 
limbs were cast in lead. His vision 
was cloudy and blurred. Normal 
sensation seeped back into his tor- 
tured body slowly. 



After half a minute’s breathing 
— deep, gasping breaths as though 
he had run a mile at top speed — 
he was able to roll over and sit up. 
His wristwatch told him that he 
had been unconscious for just 
over three minutes. 

Strang sprawled on the floor six 
feet away, awash in the greenish 
slime that still oozed from the 
duct. Mallory touched his mind — 
only a faint, diffuse glow indi- 
cated a lingering residual vitality 
in Strang’s individual cells. He 
channeled energy to Strang’s ego- 
center. After a moment he sensed 
a weak response. He persevered, 
felt the mind quicken under his 
touch. At once he expanded the 
mind/ mind interface, creating a 
point-by-point correspondence 
that linked his mental field with 
Strang’s. There was no need now 
for verbalization. In the moment 
of contact, the Strang mind ab- 
sorbed in instantaneous gestalt 
the status-dynamic Mallory pre- 
sented. As swiftly and completely 
as a fluid shapes itself to a con- 
tainer, Strang’s mind and Mal- 
lory’s interpenetrated, locked into 
mutual balance, became one. 

Mallory was simultaneously 
aware, on multiple levels, of a 
multitude of forms and relation- 
ships and entropic flows that wove 
a network encompassing the time- 
space locus in which he existed; of 
a precise set of matter energy in- 
terlocks that was the Mone; of his 



144 



IF 




own impingement on the greater 
pattern; of the potential implicit 
in the unorganized play of random 
energies which flickered peripher- 
ally to the central reality-matrix. 
In immediate, instinctive response 
he extended his newly augmented 
sensitivity to the next adjacent 
human mind-field, probed through 
the inhibiting control layers to the 
inner ego-core. 

Awareness of a woman’s self- 
picture flooded into his mind — 
all the memories and complexities 
of a full human existence were 
comprehended in a single poly- 
ordinal gestalt. For a fractional in- 
stant he sensed her amazement at 
the strange touch invading her 
identity, the beginning of a flash 
of atavistic fear; then he had 
shunted aside her feeble ego-asser- 
tion reflex, added the computa- 
tional and conceptualizing cir- 
cuitry of her mind to the Mallory/ 
Strang duality. 

Again the level of illumination 
rose. New vistas of ever-expand- 
ing, ever-convoluting mind-struc- 
ture slid into focus. With new 
sureness, the compound mind 
touched half a dozen more brains 
in swift succession, adding their 
powers to the growing complex. 
The seventh mind broke like a 
bubble — its colors faded, dissi- 
pated, were gone. The Mallory 
overmind reached farther. Two 
more minds were added. The tenth 
resisted violently, fighting like a 



drowning man against submer- 
gence — impatiently, the newborn 
thought-creature that had been 
Mallory overrode the fragile de- 
fenses, engulfed the central 
thought-node. 

He paused, assessing his new 
self-awareness, sensing the expan- 
sion of his capabilities to encom- 
pass the hundred-fold increase in 
computer capacity. For the first 
time now he was able to integrate 
the entirety of the Mone mind 
structure and his own relationship 
thereto. The shock of what he saw 
rocked him to the basic suture of 
the initial Strang/Mallory union. 

My God — I'm like a chip in a 
mi llr ace compared with that . 

The thought flashed and was 
dismissed in the immediacy of his 
reaction. He launched himself out- 
ward on all fronts, sweeping in 
numbed human minds, spilling out 
the resident egos as rudely as a 
starving man shelling oysters, 
erecting a defensive mind-struc- 
ture with frantic haste. He felt only 
a remote pang — a ghostly echo of 
a forgotten emotion — as he recog- 
nized the identities of his last ac- 
quisitions: Gill — Randy — Marla. 

His outward sweep complete, 
he paused, consolidating his posi- 
tion. The Mone mind-array 
seemed to have shrunk somewhat. 
It no longer loomed like a planet 
— but it was a mountain to his 
boulder. He saw the truncated 
force-lines that had been sheared

by his sudden action, recognized 
the developing Mone reaction- 
pattern, computed the force and 
direction of the counter-stroke, re- 
oriented himself, marshaling his 
defensive capabilities. 

His Universe burst in an explo- 
sion of white fire. 

S PACE/TIME reformed itself 
around Mallory. The flow of 
mighty energies roared past and 
through him like an explosion 
without end. Out of the chaos he 
abstracted those qualities from 
which he was capable of formulat- 
ing a conceptualization. 

And he was face to face with 
strangeness beyond his ability to 
comprehend. 

The mind/ face of the Mone. 

In a single glimpse that scanned 
back down the endless avenue of 
time he saw the dim beginnings of 
this incredible being; the long, 
slow evolution of form and struc- 
ture, the advent of neural respon- 
siveness, the birth of mind, its 
growth and flowering into a mighty 
fountain of intellect. He observed 
as the Mone, achieving direct 
mental control of the mechanics of 
genetics and heredity, formed it- 
self for expansion, launched itself 
on the ages-long campaign of de- 
struction-absorption of competing 
intellectual species which ended 
in its sole and undisputed posses- 
sion of its home galaxy. He was 
witness as the great intelligence 



pruned itself, perfecting the purity 
of its cerebral function, trimming 
away the extraneous physical 
bodies which housed the multi- 
tudinous facets of its communal 
personality. The time came when 
the Mone — a race implicit in a 
single, integrated galaxy-span- 
ning thought-complex — found it- 
self faced with entropic death. 
Having mastered its environment 
too perfectly, it faced sensory de- 
privation of a degree commensur- 
ate with its frustrated abilities. Un- 
less new challenges, new spectra cf 
experience could be found, it was 
doomed to wither, lose coherence, 
wink out of existence. 

The Mone integrated the data, 
arrived at an inescapable conclu- 
sion. In order to retain even an at- 
tenuated continuity of awareness, 
it would have to divest itself of its 
total victory. It must resume the 
trappings of physical life, reenter 
the lists of life-death competition. 

But it was the sole surviving life 
in its galaxy, all other forms hav- 
ing been either annihilated or ab- 
sorbed along the evolutionary 
paths. The neighboring galaxies 
must serve as the arena for the 
.next evolutionary advance of the 
Mone. 

Stimulated to a new outpouring 
of creativity comparable with the 
vast accomplishments of its 
youth, the Mone created an in- 
finitely flexible modus operandi. 
It selected suitable inert minerals.

IF 




shaped them into vessels capable 
of the long voyage; stocked them 
with thought-absorbent material 
of complex structure on which 
were impressed the cerebral pat- 
terns basic to the Mone identity 
and launched its intellectual off- 
spring in a vast seeding that radi- 
ated at light-speed from the home 
galaxy. 

And in that instant it compre- 
hended a basic truth of the Uni- 
verse: having spawned, it must die. 
The primordial intelligence that 
had become the Mone knew for 
one infinitesimal — and eternal — 
increment of time the basic axiom 
of existence: That which once was 
is eternal; that which is to be has 
always been. 

Then it existed no more. 

But deep in intergalactic space, 
each individual repository of the 
Mone-pattern knew and recog- 
nized the extinction of the ances- 
tor-mind and drew from this 
knowledge a new awareness of the 
depth of its commitment to the 
continuity of the parent-concept. 

Space is vast. One by one the 
original spore-pods, each receding 
from all its fellows at a noncom- 
putable velocity — the sum of light- 
speed plus light-speed — passed 
out of the awareness-range of the 
others. Alone in immensity, each 
fractional simulacrum of the origi- 
nal, faced for the first time with 
the fact of solitude, reoriented it- 



self — and reached the identical 
conclusion: 

Each was the sole, lone reposi- 
tory of the galaxy-devouring force 
that was the Mone life-concept. On 
each devolved the ultimate re- 
sponsibility for survival of that- 
which-must-not-die. 

Eons of utter solitude ensued. 
Mallory was present when at last 
a star swam close, its gravitational 
field reaching across dwindling 
space to awaken the response-pat- 
tern of the pod. He followed it, 
with it participated in the plane- 
tary approach, using, by encoded 
instinct, the versatile organo- 
mechanisms designed and created 
for this moment. He experienced 
the entry into atmosphere, the 
gathering of data, extrapolation, 
reaction: the selection of a precise 
landing point — a vacant lot in the 
inner suburban area of the city of 
Beatrice. 

N OW, ensconced on a world in- 
conceivably distant from that 
which gave it birth, the Mone 
identity proceeded with that- 
which-must-be-done. The football- 
sized pod, buried beneath a heap 
of brick rubble, released the pre- 
cautionary poisons designed to rid 
the planet of possible competitive 
life-forms — forms capable of phys- 
ically competing with the embry- 
onic Worker-forms when they first 
crawled forth to grow to swift 
adulthood. 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL

Within seventy-two hours the 
wave of death had passed around 
the globe, vectored not only by 
natural atmospheric forces but 
carried by the swift craft on which 
would-be escapees had fled, carry- 
ing their fates with them. Doomed 
airliners had crashed as their 
crews succumbed to the killing- 
mould. But the deadly spores sur- 
vived the impacts, were spread 
again, renewed from each new 
center of infection. 

For a week, the local life had 
survived, fighting back blindly 
with all the weapons at its com- 
mand. The killing agent had been 
identified, a counteracting sub- 
stance devised, emergency pro- 
grams put in effect for mass pro- 
duction of the antitoxin. 

The last organized resistance 
had been the release of a counter- 
phage which spread total destruc- 
tion over a ten-mile-wide patch of 
scorched earth surrounding the 
research station at Point Char- 
lotte, Virginia. Two hours later 
the Mone had reoccupied the 
area. 

Within the inner circle at Bea- 
trice twelve hundred and fifty-one 
brain-stunned natives had been 
imprinted with the necessary data 
to enable them to provide the 
requisite additional labor for the 
preparation for the secondary 
seeding; in a band around the city 
approximately fifteen miles in 
width, some hundreds of native 



survivors existed, free. A sense- 
barrier was erected to bar them 
from the next area and the work 
forward. 

Supervised by the pseudohu- 
man constructs created for the 
purpose — designed to mimic the 
native workers in order to create 
the minimal adjustment-gap — the 
impressed workers first erected 
the tower which housed the birth- 
channel through which the tai- 
lored seed of the Mone would be 
ejected at supersonic speed to en- 
ter the jet stream and spread over 
the world. Then they had been re- 
programed to process the spe- 
cific nutrient molecules required 
by the growing spore-body — and 
at last, in the final phase, to as- 
semble the final genetic incre- 
ments that would determine the 
prespawning inprinting with 
which the myriad offspring would 
be endowed to best fit them for 
their task — the construction of 
the sites from which a new wave 
of spore-pods would go forth to 
infect the galaxy. 

The maturation of the seed had 
proceeded smoothly. The precom- 
puted statistical determinations 
had been satisfied. Imprinting 
was almost complete; the moment 
of release approached, when the 
voracious instinct-appetite would 
be sated at last. And in this penul- 
timate moment, a curious phe- 
nomenon had blossomed on the 
Mone existence-horizon. 



148 



IF 




For long billionths of a second 
the great Mone mind had failed 
utterly to comprehend what was 
taking place. And then, with a 
blinding insight that rocked its 
cosmic image to the core, it had 
understood. 

It was not alone. 

For the first time in all the in- 
conceivable eons since its incep- 
tion the Mone had encountered 
an intelligence co-equal and ex- 
ternal to itself. The impact of 
that realization coursed through 
all of its vast data-collecting and 
collating capacity like a storm, 
upsetting the basic theorems of 
its existence. For an immeasur- 
able instant the great mind tee- 
tered on the edge of dissolution: 
And in that moment Mallory 
struck. 

L IKE an overstressed dam that 
collapses when a single vital 
pebble crumbles from its base, the 
immense complexity that was the 
Mone overbrain began to disin- 
tegrate. The far-flung sensory and 
manipulative fabric split, broke 
apart, withering back on its 
sources. The inner network of 
regulatory and sustaining field- 
circuitry, bereft of input, went 
into oscillation, disassociated it- 
self into its primitive components 
and self-destructed. The ego-core, 
stripped of all sensation and pow- 
er, closed in on itself, encysted, 
winked out of existence. 



In a silence that seemed to 
reach to the end of infinity the 
Mallory mind-construct hovered, 
straining outward, sensing the 
nearby star-crackle, the remoter 
hiss of the neighbor-galaxies, the 
pervasive tone of the over-galaxy. 

He /it withdrew from the brink 
of mind-shattering emptiness, 
shaken and awed. In haste he/it 
irised in on the source-point 
shrinking back and down, com- 
pressing, dwindling, fleeing. 

Pressure, pain, the return of 
physical sensation. 

Mallory sat up, rose unsteadily 
to his feet. 

Strang groaned and stirred, 
Mallory squatted beside him. 

“Wake up,” he said, hearing 
his own voice as an echo from a 
time and place more remote than 
the farthest star. “Wake up, 
Strang. We’ve won.” 

M ALLORY and Strang found 
the exit passage from the in- 
ner chamber, made their way out 
into the workroom and a scene of 
pandemonium. Over four hun- 
dred men and women, released 
abruptly from the tight mental 
control that had held them for 
over three months, with no mem- 
ories of the lost days, had reacted 
in their individual ways. Some sat 
mute and numb. Some had made 
frantically for the nearest exit. A 
few had become hysterical. Oth- 
ers had attacked the not-men

who wandered, mindless, among 
them, had torn them into blood- 
less fragments. 

Mallory searched through the 
crowd, failed to find Gill or the 
children. 

“Maybe they’ve gone home,” 
Strang suggested. 

They left the tower, ignored 
by the gaunt, ragged, mad-eyed 
crowd now streaming away across 
the barren courtyard, staring in- 
credulously back at the tower that 
had apparently sprung miracu- 
lously from the ground overnight. 
In the street Mallory heard the 
first screams of those who were 
beginning at last to understand 
the full scope of the disaster that 
had befallen them. A man in the 
remnants of a gray business suit 
stood as if stunned before the gut- 
ted ruin that had been his newly 
expanded department store. A 
woman sat on the front steps of a 
house, sobbing, holding a mouldy 
doll in her hands. A hollow-faced 
teenaged boy walked unsteadily 
down the middle of the street 
talking to himself. 

Gil! was lying face down on the 
sidewalk leading to the front steps 
of the house. Mallory turned her 
over gently. She was barely 
breathing. 

“We’d better get her inside,” 
Strang said. 

His voice seemed to Mallory to 
come from far away. 

“Yes.” 



Mallory lifted her, carried her 
up the steps into the gloom of the 
curtained living room, along the 
passage to a bedroom. Strang 
checked her pulse. 

“Not good,” he said. “Damn 
it, we need a doctor, Mallory.” 

“Everet,” Mallory said. “Get 
him.” 

He jabbed at the man’s mind, 
implanted the information that 
Everet’s house was three doors 
away. Strang was staggered by 
the impact of the invasion of his 
brain. He looked at Mallory with 
an expression of amazement 
tinged with fear. 

“What — ” he started. 

Get him. 

Mallory turned back to Gill, 
probed delicately at her mind, 
found it closed and shuttered 
against him. He stood by the 
window and stared unseeing at 
the street. 

He was distantly aware of 
Strang’s movements. He ob- 
served Strang’s encounter with 
the doctor, monitored the conver- 
sation: 

Doctor — a woman — Mrs. Mal- 
lory. She's in a coma, pulse weak, 
respiration way down ; cool to the 
touch. I think she's dying. 

Later, sir. As soon as I can. 
There’s a young fellow — badly cut 
up. Fell into glass. Bleeding like a 
stuck pig. And John Bates— brok- 
en leg, I think, and probably in- 
ternal damage. 



150 



IF 




It ’s just a few doors down, doc- 
tor . Can you — 

As soon as / can. A boys dying. 

Mallory thrust through, im- 
planted a command. Everet broke 
off in mid-sentence, turned, 
started toward the Mallory house. 
Half a minute later he entered the 
room. He glanced at Mallory, 
went to Gill’s side, examined her 
quickly. 

“She’s in a bad way,” he said. 

His voice was ragged. 

“Restore her to health,” Mal- 
lory said flatly. “She’s needed.” 

“Of course I’ll do what I can.” 
For a few minutes, Everet worked 
swiftly, preparing and administer- 
ing two injections. He listened to 
the woman’s heartbeat, shook his 
head solemnly. 

“I won’t lie to you, Mallory,” 
he said. “I’m afraid we’re going 
to lose her. There’s no response. 
She’s sinking.” 

Mallory stood at the bedside. 
He touched Gill’s mind, noting 
the feebleness of the glow. He 
reached deep into her brain, 
found the fading spark that was 
her life. 

She stirred faintly in response. 
He sensed her recognition of him. 

Gill — you mustn’t die. 

I tried, Jeff. For your sake and 
the children’s — / tried to go on. 
But the weight was too much. I 
had to let go. 

Live. 

“Mallory — are you all right?” 



Strang’s voice rasped at him. 

He struck the interruption 
aside, clinging to the fading con- 
tact with the diminishing mind- 
glow. 

You have to live. 

He sensed her silent cry of 
pain, her recoil from the power of 
the mental blow. 

No . no more . you’re not 
. Jeff . Jeff is gone ... all 
gone . nothing left . 

And then there was no response 
from the gray vacancy like cold 
ashes that occupied the point 
where the last spark of Gill’s life 
had winked and died. 

S TRANG and Everet stared at 
him as he turned, pushed past 
them. Two small, white-faced peo- 
ple met him in the hall. A long 
moment passed before he recog- 
nized them as Randy and Marla. 

“Your mother is dead,” he said 
tonelessly and went past them 
and out into the street. 

He walked but was unaware of 
walking. The sun sank. Twilight 
fell. Here and there the glow of 
firelight shone through windows. 
The power had failed at last. A 
cold wind blew along the dark 
street. He came to an open field. 
Moonlight shone whitely on dead 
grasses, a leafless tree. Stars 
glared down impersonally from 
the deep black sky. Without 
warning, a wave of desolation 
swept down like a tidal comber

and smashed the breath from his 
lungs. 

“Alone,” he groaned. “Oh, 
God, so aloire.” 

He felt he was drowning in a 
bleakness more terrifying than the 
prospect of death. He fell to his 
knees, impaled on torment like a 
worm impaled on a thorn. 

A soft voice said, “Jeff — 
please.” 

Sally kneeled beside him, put 
her hands on him, held him to 
her. He pushed her away. 

“Jeff — I only meant—” 

You think I'm weeping for 
Gill? His thoughts raged, un- 
spoken, unspeakable. You’re 
wrong. It's not that at all. It's not 
humanity I weep for — or any- 
thing human . 

“Jeff — you look so strange—” 

You don't know, you could 
never understand. No human on 
earth ever could understand. For 
one moment— for one tiny instant 
— I held the Universe in my 
hands and looked across that 
vastness of space and time and 
beheld another mind that was my 
equal. And what did I do? Did I 
meet it, join it on that level be- 
yond human comprehension? No. 
It lowered its defenses to me — 
and I killed it. It's not Mankind 
I'm mourning. It's the Mone ... 

Out of darkness, a shaft of 
light, dazzlingly pure, lanced to 
the center of Mallory’s conscious- 
ness. 



Man, I still live , the voiceless 
voice of the Mone said. Now may 
we speak together? 

I T WAS a conversation held 
without words in a timeless 
place of pure thought. 

I did not know, Man. This does 
not excuse my crime — nor bring 
back that which is lost. Yet I 
would make amends ... 

Mallory strove to penetrate the 
word-screen, achieve again the 
one-to-one rapport that he had 
known in the moment that he had 
confronted the Mone’s naked 
mind. He found the barrier im- 
penetrable. 

No, Man — you are not yet 
ready to exercise the full powers 
inherent in your destiny, the 
Mone admonished him. / blun- 
dered when I failed correctly to 
assess the mental capacity of your 
race on my first approach — and 
again, when I too-quickly opened 
myself to you. There are powers 
here which would rend this planet 
to dust if not controlled. 

Angered, Mallory strove harder 
— and found himself gently 
seized, held. 

Man — you are a young species, 
inexperienced, still closely linked 
to material flesh. In your hour of 
crisis you showed qualities that 
will one day make you great. But 
you have much to learn, a long 
apprenticeship to serve before you 
evolve so far along the trail as to

know the true Junction oj mind , 
the true glory of thought. 

Mallory would have protested 
but the Mone went on. 

Your world has been cruelly 
depopulated oj your kind by my 
heedless act but the remaining 
genetic pool is large enough to re- 
store your numbers in a Jew short 
millennia. I will provide an ade- 
quate number oj lije-artijacts — 
like those you destroyed in your 
Jrenzy but oj Junctional Jorm — 
to assist you during your period 
oj rebuilding. Your cities are in 
the main intact — an empty but 
jruitjul planet awaits you. And 
perhaps in your rebirth you will 
escape the errors that marred 
your jirst rise , as I glimpsed them 
when our minds met. And as the 
years oj your primal age pass I 
will watch over you, guard you 
jrom dangers without and within, 
until I have expiated the evil I 
unwittingly did you. Then I will 
pass on my way. Perhaps some 
day — ten million years jrom now 
— we will meet again as friends 
and equals among the galaxies. 

Wait ! 

Mallory hurled the plea with 
all the force of his compound 
mind. But before the echo of 
the thought had died he had 
forgotten it. For a moment 
longer, as his briefly held powers 
slipped away, he clung to the 



lingering sense of something sub- 
lime, glimpsed once and never 
seen again. 

Then that vision, too, was gone. 

And he was only a man, 
crouched against the earth that 
had brought him forth. 



H E WEPT for Gill and put 

flowers on her grave. March 
came with clear skies. The strange, 
faceless beings who had emerged 
from the tower — curiously, no one 
feared them or recoiled from their 
appearance — toiled day and night 
to restore and rebuild, to farm the 
abandoned acreage outside the 
city, to operate the power gener- 
ating plant, the water system, to 
staff the hospital. Vines grew up 
around the tower and wild flow- 
ers sprouted along the wall that 
was crumbling rapidly away. 
The six hundred and twenty 
citizens of Earth learned to 
live again, to pick up the frag- 
ments of old relationships, to 
begin the long process of build- 
ing new ones. 

On the first day of April Jeff 
Mallory and Sally were married 
in a ceremony attended by the 
entire population of the world. 
They held carnival for a day — 
then they picked up their tools 
and returned to the task of forg- 
ing the future of Man. •

found his and kissed it. Raising 
her head again, not letting go his 
old thin fingers, she said, “And — 
do we not even know your name? 
I just realized — the machine said 
not that you are Alexander — only 
that you wish to be known as 
Alexander!” 

“This, too, has been done be- 
fore,” the old man said. “There 
was once a knot so complicated no 
one could untie it. A man called 
Alexander rose up, cut it with a 
sword. To loose the bonds we 
heedlessly used to hobble the hu- 
man race — it seems I, too, must 
be crude. It is not something I 



would wish my own name to be 
remembered for. My second Rec- 
ord.” 

He smiled and gave her hand a 
final squeeze. 

“Go, then, my friends — and re- 
member. Always do the best you 
can.” 

W HEN they looked back from 
the door of the great hall, he 
was sitting calmly with his staff in 
his hand. And when the hour was 
up there were no staff or Registry 
or Alexander — only a little hot 
dust drifting on the light of the 
stars. •

“All.” 

“You will not change your

“I will not.” 

“So I see.” 

“Thank you for your offer. It

fully decline. I think you can find 
the way out.” 

The man in the book-cluttered 
room sat quietly in his chair for

a long time after his visitor had 
left. Then he rose, walked to a 
desk in the corner, took paper 
from it and a pen and began to 
write. 

In the street outside, the visitor 
looked toward the house he had 
just left and then toward the dark 
hills where the evening star now 
had set and Orion was sinking. He 
stood there for a long time before 
he faded like an afterimage and 
was gone. • 



IF 




HUE ANDCRY 

(Continued from page 2) 

the Editor s seat, I should hope that 
the magazines' quality will improve in 
a like fashion. 

But there are two pieces in the 
latest IF which get my goat. The first 
is, unfortunately, your editorial. I 
don't begrudge Dr. Menzel's concep- 
tions if he means them only as jokes 
— but if he actually believes in them, 
I shudder to think of the names of the 
farside craters. Mare Elron? Oceanus 
Flatearthers? Shaver Crater? 

(Incidentally, Dr. Robert S. Rich- 
ardson of Griffith Observatory has 
proposed that a farside crater be 
named after the late Uncle Willy 
Ley. He seems to think that the best 
location for Crater Ley would be near 
Craters Tsiolkov sky and Jules Verne.) 

And speaking of Tsiolkovsky — it 
was with great dissatisfaction that I 
muddled through Dr. Tsvetikov's 
article. Tsiolkovsky was a great 
rocket pioneer but you must remem- 
ber that he owed a great deal of his 
philosophy to the Revolution. I am 
not condemning you for publishing 
Communist philosophy. It's always 
interesting to see what people of other 
political viewpoints are doing, say I. 

Now, Tsiolkovsky as a science 
fiction writer is vastly different from 
Tsiolkovsky as a rocket man. Isaac 
Asimov, who came to the U.S. from 
Russia at the age of three, a great 
science fiction writer in his own right 
who has read, with interest, some 
Soviet Science Fiction (he has con- 
tributed introductions to two anthol- 
ogies of SSF), has pointed out that 
Soviet sf is severely limited when it 
comes to sociological science fiction. 



by the very nature of the USSR gov- 
ernment. GALAXY was edited by 
Horace Gold and was originally in- 
tended to be a gathering of fresh socio- 
logical sf ideas — it still is, I guess, 
though most science fiction seems to 
be somewhat sociological these days. 

For another thing, I cannot either 
understand or agree with the “Razve 
mozhmo somnyevat ‘ sya " theses. In 
them, Tsiolkovsky begins with a de- 
ceptively simple statement (though it 
is a statement which, I am told, is 
some news to most Russians), and 
then proceeds into an entire series of 
non sequiturs which seem to me to re- 
flect Tsiolkovsky' s own inferiority 
complex, combined with the wishful 
thinking of the Soviet state that 
“ Communism is the best form of 
government." Tsiolkovsky has used, 
apparently, the same odd Soviet logic 
here that enabled Ivan Yefremov to 
call Murray Leinster a man with the 
heart of a serpent. 

But still, as I said, it is always nice 
to know what the Communists are 
thinking. This same odd Soviet logic 
that I mentioned above may perhaps 
be the reason why Richard Nixon's 
signature now rests upon the Moon, 
instead of perhaps Podgornys, 
Brezhnev's and Kosygin's. 

I notice from the bar of black on 
your front cover that IF has skipped 
another issue. It is sad to see a mag- 
azine skip two issues in one year, be- 
cause IF hasn't missed one since Sep- 
tember, 1964. But then, ASTOUND- 
ING skipped several issues in the 
early 1930's — before it was finally res- 
urrected by Street and Smith. 

And GALAXY has missed an is- 
sue, too. Maybe two issues — I haven't 
seen any GALAXIES around since 



155 




the August one, and the Sunset Dis- 
tributors, hell take them, have a 
favorite sport of delaying science 
fiction magazines to Greater Los 
Angeles. GALAXY hasn't missed 
an issue since December, 1955. And I 
certainly hope that the new format 
won't cause it to go back on bi- 
monthly format. Heavens! It went 
monthly only recently! 

Now, a few suggestions: I congrat- 
ulate you for giving IF a book column 
and hope that you will give GALAXY 
a long-needed letter column. Simply 
because Horace Gold polled the read- 
ers back in 1951 and decided not to 
include one is no reason why there 
cannot be one now. 

Maybe you could start a sort of 
story-review feature rated by the 
Readers, where we Humble People 
could make our preferences and de- 
sires known to the Editor. This isn't 
an original idea, but the person who 
first used it uses it to this day, so it 
must be a successful idea. 

Also, please bring back the SF 
CALENDAR. 

Now, about authors : it would be 
nice if you could round up the follow- 
ing authors in the next year or so: 
Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, 
and Arthur C. Clarke. They are ob- 
viously the Big Three Science Fiction 
Writers In The World, and not much 
of their writing has appeared in recent 
months. And, of course, fiction by 
such other greats as del Rey, An- 
thony, Anderson, Simak, Laumer, 
Herbert, Brunner, Budrys, Clement, 
Ellison, Dickson, Garrett (hey! I'm 
runnin ' outa space!), Leiber, Mc- 
Caffrey, Leinster, Niven, Panshin, 
Pohl, Tenn, van Vogt, Williamson, 



Zelazny and so many others whose 
names I momentarily forget. Sure, 
you can print stuff by such trite and 
unexperienced hacks as Tepper, but 
just as long as you’ve got the good 
writers — 

In closing, I would like to reiter- 
ate my fond wishes that GALAXY 
and IF will continue to be Two Great 
Magazines. In the more recent days, 
Pohl catered too much to ' the mothers 
of some of the readers,” and all too 
often had an artist do a cover, and 
then commissioned a writer to write 
a story to fit the cover. I hope that 
this last practice will be abolished 
completely — after all, the cover of a 
magazine is intended to be an artist's 
image of something originally de- 
scribed in words — not just any wild- 
looking thing that the artist conjures 
up out of nowhere, and to which the 
poor writer must confine his work. 

But I have to stop somewhere, and 
it might as well be here. 

Good luck! 

M. B. Tepper 
Santa Monica, Calif. 

And luck to you, M.B. You and I 
will get along — you’re one of the peo- 
ple an editor works for. When you 
write for IF] GALAXY don’t write 
for me — dig it out of yourself and 
pitch to the readers. You know them. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

After subscribing to GALAXY for 
more than ten years, I feel as though 
I have been HAD. You raved about 
the new Dune story by Frank Her- 
bert. I used tremendous restraint and 
did not start the story in July. Then 
no August issue, not even one on the 
newsstands. 



156 




/ have written once and received jio 
answer of any sort. All I really want 
is a copy of part II of Dune Messiah. 
Is that really too much to request? 

Keep up the quality oj GALAXY 
and I will still love you despite the 
mixup in August. 

Harriette Schapiro 
San Diego, California 

An August GALAXY is coming 
your way — and my love, too. You’re 
my kind and so is the next guy. Why 
don’t you two say hello? 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

You have the most miserable sub- 
scription service of any sf magazine. 
Perhaps if you told us in the current 
issue when the next issue will be out 
you could relieve yourself of some 
very annoying letters. 

Mark Lee 
Orange, Conn. 
P.S.: An IF subscriber and proud of 
it! 

And I’m proud of you. Subscrip- 
tion has been notified. 

Dear Editor: 

The two worst mistakes you made 
since your advent as editor of GAL- 
AXY and IF were very bad ones. Re- 
ducing GALAXY to 160 pages was 
the worst. I’d rather have 194 GAL- 
AXY pages than the return of 
WORLDS OF TOMORROW. Or 
perhaps you could take thirty pages 
from IF and add them to GALAXY. 
You see, we were all very proud of 
having the largest magazine around 
and we’ve just got to get it back. 

Taking the illustrations away was 
the next one. They really added a lot 
to the story — especially with artists 



like Morrow and Reese (the only 
things I liked about the Spork stories 
were the illustrations). 

In reply to Anne Me Caffrey’s 
letter (September issue): why did you 
take Gaughans poetic illustration 
from Hue & Cry? You said you would 
keep the features. And what hap- 
pened to Authorgraphs and SF Cal- 
endar (I didn’t care for IF — and 
When/? 

In closing — how about lining up a 
Zelazny serial? A fine writer. Does he 
have a book out that didn’t win an 
award? 

Craig Grant 

Saskatchewan, Canada 

You wrote some time ago. How do 
you like our looks now? Despite the 
fewer pages you’re getting as much 
reading matter as ever. Type size does 
it. The reason for the 160 pages in 
both IF and GALAXY is a purely 
mechanical one — to hit our schedules 
now that we’re underway we have to 
be processed together at the bindery. 

WORLDS OF TOMORROW will 
have an entirely new look and will 
steal no stories from IF/GALAXY — 
or pages for that matter. The Cal- 
endar is back and Authorgraphs 
will appear when authors have some- 
thing to say they can’t express in their 
stories. 

The new Hue and Cry heading was 
designed by Brian Gaughan, Jack 
Gaughan’s young son. Jack feels, 
and I agree, that it too has poetry — 
the poetry of reality and tomorrow. 

Dear Editor: 

You seem to be keeping GALAXY 
and IF as good (if not better — I was 
impressed with the last few and com- 



157 




ing editions ) as it was before. As my 
contribution to this — / would like to 
suggest that you keep publishing the 
authors that you have been, especially 
Robert Sil verb erg and Larry Niven. 
And get some stories by Zelazny, 
Harlan Ellison and some long work 
by Samuel Delany. He is the world's 
best sf author. ) 

What will the new WORLDS OF 
TOMORROW be like? GALAXY and 
IF are far better than any other maga- 
zine in the field. I hope adding, anoth- 
er won't force you to print worse 
stories. 

Will you publish all the Hugo and 
Nebula winners to date and the guests 
of honor at the conventions? And for 
your 20th-anniversary issue, how 
about getting stories from the main 
New Wave authors? 

I have just finished reading Star- 
child by Frederik Pohl and Jack Wil- 
liamson and / was quite surprised to 
find two of Larry Niven's main 
themes, the body banks and currant 
addiction, in the book. Is it actually 
Fred Pohl who thought of these and 
suggested them to Niven? 

Good luck in the coming year — and 
keep Hue and Cry. 

Jon Raz 

Berkeley, California 

Ideas, like seeds, travel on the wind 
— and no two writers handle them 
alike. Usually there’s no connection 
— several authors may hit on similar 
themes independently. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

As a reader of GALAXY since 
1952, I would like to make a few com- 
ments on the GALAXY magazines, 
as to what I would like to see retained 



and what / would not like to see any 
more. 

First of all, please maintain the 
listing of sf conventions, etc. in IF. 
This is invaluable and takes up very 
little .space. Secondly, the Author- 
graphs and Galaxy’s Stars are in- 
teresting, at least to someone who's 
been reading sf long enough to won- 
der whether or not SF writers are 
really human. / enjoy them immensly. 

I hesitate to say keep Algis Budrys 
as book reviewer — there have been 
many issues of GALAXY when his 
review was the best thing in it. But / 
do miss his fiction. (I think that's a 
left-handed compliment to Budrys.) 

There have been many complaints 
about GALAXY’^ art and the paper 
used for printing. Personally, I like 
it as is. 

/ would like to see a lot less serials. 
I seem to be alone in this, too. And, 
for God's sake, no more of those 
damn science nonfact articles. 

Finally, I hope you will continue 
the yearly contest that Fred Pohl ini- 
tiated last year. And please include 
me in the next mailing of ballots. 

Grant Carrington 
North Haven, Conn. 

Okay. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I found the IF first writer. Jack L. 
Alston, to be a fine and promising 
beginner. Though he was a little 
sketchy on technicalities (such as how 
the hell did he get off that sun?), 
Alston seemed very original in his de- 
tails — a captivating imagination. 

Please print him in the future.

THE SPACE MERCHANTS by Frederlk Pohl and 
C. M. Kombluth. Two major advertising agencies 
are fighting for the Venus account — nothing less 
than total control of the Venus economy and mar- 
kets. will do. It is completely unimportant that 
Venus is a harsh, barren, uninhabited planet. 
According to the mentality of Mitchell Courtenay 
of Fowler Schocken Associates, the trick is to per- 
suade colonists to go to Venus, and once there, 
they will have to survive as best they can. One of 
the most savage and devastating attacks on mod- 
ern consumer society and the advertising agents 
who are its high priests. The Space Merchants is 
uncomfortably prophetic.
