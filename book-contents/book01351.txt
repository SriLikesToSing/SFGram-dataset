A NEW THRILL FOR READERS OF galaxy 



The story of a space 
threat to Earth men 
so horrible — and 
so completely 
possible — that 
medical science 
is afraid to 
contemplate its 
consequences 




•Kii 



A novel by MARTIN CAIDIN 

On Space Station Epsilon, a mysterious illness is killing off the scientists 
who man the station. 

Should those still alive be brought back to Earth and risk infecting all 
human life — or be sacrificed in an orbiting tomb? 

On Earth, medical science is helpless. Terrified people are rioting, protesting 
the space ship's return. Official Washington is torn by the desperate 
dilemma. On Space Station Epsilon no one knows what his fate will be. 

" , . thrilling moments. Caidin writes well and with imagination," 
says Weekly. In FOUR CAME BACK the award-winning master 

of space-age science-fiction has turned out a great story — fiction with the 
frightening ring of scientific possibility, not in 2100 but in the 1970s.

SPACE ART 



W hen we first began reading sci- 
ence fiction, which is quite 
a few years ago, one of the things 
that most caught our fancy about 
the sf magazines of the times was 
the pretty pictures on the cover and 
inside. Remember those Frank R. 
Pauls and Bonestells, with the lovely 
rocketships landed on the Moon and 
the gorgeous views of Earth as seen 
from space? Thirty years ago these 
pictures were sheerest fantasy, as 
far from real human experience as 
any thing in the stories. 

Today they’ve come into the real 
world, and they are as beautiful real 
as they were in imagination. You 
can see all you want of them for 
$4.25, in a new book published by 
the Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing Office, 
called Exploring Space with a Cam- 
era, 

To get these pictures for us took 
the combined efforts of tens of thou- 
sands of scientists and technicians 
around the world, as well as an astro- 
nomical number of doUars and ru- 
bles. We think they were worth the 
price. Luna Ill’s first pictures of the 
far side of the Moon, now alnjost a 
decade old, gave us not merely a bet- 
ter look at a near neighbor than we 
had ever had before, but a sight of a 
landscape no human eyes had ever 
seen. Surveyor I’s self-portraits, 
showing the long ladder of a hu- 
man spacecraft on the barren 
rock of another world, are as 
impressive embodied in a book, 
as they were on the world’s TV 



screens, back in the summer of 1966. 
The Gemini color photographs of 
Earth, the Apollo IV color shot of 
the glowing Saturn V interstage fall- 
ing away after separation, any of a 
dozen others in this book are worth 
hanging on your wall. 

We think thpy’re beautiful, and 
we think you will too. 

But how many more like this 
are we likely to see? The space pro- 
gram is coasting along these days; 
probably it will carry out all Ae 
goals it set for itself a decade ago 
. but then what? 

In spite of pious words from pol- 
iticians, it is pretty clear that the 
steam has gone out pf space. There 
are no new long-range goals, no 
plans to go on to the outer planets, 
to send men to Mars, least of all to 
take the big and all important leap 
to other stars. The money has dried 
up. Not only in the U.S.; Professor 
Sedov hints that it’s true in Russia 
as well; one of the most important 
international space organizations is 
canceling its next year’s meeting, 
because the funds to pay for it have 
gone. 

If the politicians have their way, 
they will be using future tax money 
in the traditional manner — to buy 
votes instead of knowledge. And the 
human race, having reached out gin- 
gerly into space, will return to its lit- 
tle wars and squabbles. 

Or shall we tell the politicians 
that they’re making a mist^e?

Six 
Gates 

To 

Limbo 

by j. T. McIntosh 

It was. a place that could be 
called Umbo* But to one, it 
would be better called Hell! 

I Imbo dropped into his hazy aware- 

ness. Being reluctant to be a man 
A fter a time that was neither without a name in a place without 
heaven nor hell, and a period a name, he named one of the two 
that was pure hell, he awoke in a at once: Limbo, 
gentle world that was not Earth, It was generously warm but not 
did not seem to be heaven and hot. The lush grass he lay on was 
was certainly not hell. The word as soft as a caress, and there was 





no more than a breath of movement 
in the rich, clean air. 

This could be Earth, but it was 
not. He knew of the planet Earth 
vaguely but so intimately, like a 
woman in the dark, that there 
could be no doubt Earth was home. 
Yet despite his real feeling for 
Earth, his love for a world he knew 
but couldn’t quite remember, peace 
flooded him as he looked around 
him and knew this was not Earth. 

Water ... he had to find water. 
Automatically he turned downhill. 

In the imdergrowth, as he walked, 
small animals scurried. He saw 
lizards, hares, small deer, and 
heard, though he didn’t see them, 
hogs and sheep. 

When he found water, there were 
no half measures about it. The 
lake was perhaps a mile across, 
blue, sparkling, clean, enchanting. 
The moment he saw it, he ran 
down a grassy slope and dived into 
the pool. 

Afterwards, on a convenient 
stone, he looked in the placid 
waters of a lakeside pool and saw 
himself. 

He was not pretty. There was 
nothing to soften the line of a 
craggy jaw, his dark eyes were flin- 
ty under black brows, and only a 
hint of humor about his mouth 
prevented his appearance from be- 
ing wholly forbidding. But he was 
satisfied. 

It was beginning to get dark, 
and he found himself quite suddenly 



so tired that the hunger which 
had begun to stir in him was far 
less important than sleep. He 
thought of making a bed, a tent, 
only vaguely aware of what beds 
and tents were. He thought of pos- 
sible danger from the wood only 
a few hundred yards away. In the 
end he found a cranny among stones 
at the water’s edge, settled himself 
comfortably on moss and fell asleep. 

"lichen he opened his eyes, he 
was stiff and sore, severing 
uncontrollably, with a raging thirst 
and no desire at all for food. Be- 
latedly he realized he should never 
have allowed himself to sleep until 
he had filled his belly, stoking the 
fires which had amost gone out in 
him. 

It was full day, bright, yet he 
could not see the sun. The sky 
was blue and cloudless, and never- 
theless he couldn’t see the sun. 

Almost without thought, he 
dived into the lake. The shock near- 
ly killed him. Instead, it brought 
him back to full, ravenous, thirsty 
life. 

He drank, and the water lay in 
his belly like lead. Now he had to 
eat. He came out of the lake run- 
ning. Nothing mattered but meat. 
It had to be meat. 

He caught a hare within two min- 
utes through fanatic determination. 
The hare had survived to that mo- 
ment through speed — but he was 
famished. He caught it and killed it 

IF

with one quick, impatient move- 
ment. Tearing away some skin, he 
sucked the still moving blood, tore 
with his teeth at the warm flesh. 

When there was nothing left on 
the bones to suck he went back to 
the lake soberly and cleaned him- 
self. Thefe was no doubt about it, 
he would have to learn to make 
fire. Eating raw flesh like an ani- 
mal was all very well when hunger 
turned the screw, but he was never 
going to be as hungry as that 
again. Not in this world of plenty. 

When he set out to explore Lim- 
bo he felt, for the first time, alone. 
He was sure he would know if there 
was another living human being 
anywhere in Limbo — and there 
was none. 

Reaching a place where the 
gradual ascent from the lake was 
steeper, he struck away from it, up 
the hill. Height might save him a 
lot of trouble. He might be able 
to survey miles of his kingdom from 
a single vantage point. 

Moments later, as the steep rise 
leveled off, he looked around and 
realized a strange thing about Lim- 
bo. 

It was astonishingly, unnatural- 
ly flat. 

True, there was a general decline 
to the lake. There had to be, or 
there would be no lake. He had 
found several small streams, over 
all of which he could jump. Fol- 
lowing any of the streams to their 
source, he could find the highest 
SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



points in his domain. But these 
could not be very high. 

Recalling the trees he had seen, 
he guessed not one was more than 
thirty or forty years old. 

There was an inescapable conclu- 
sion. Since Limbo was d'early not 
a natural world, someone^had made 
it less than half a century ago. 

T Te did follow a stream. About 
^ ^ six miles from the lake, the 
stream welled from a hole in a 
rock. Farther on, behind the rock, 
the ground level, which had never 
risen much, fell away sharply. 

He looked at the clear water 
gushing from the rock and found 
it, as a spring, decidedly uncon- 
vincing. The spring welled from the 
highest point around, one of the 
highest points in Limbo. Of course 
such things could happen. But this 
spring looked, despite the natural 
setting, very like a public drinking 
fountain fed by pipes. And behind 
the stream he had traced to its un- 
convincing source, the ground, al- 
most flat everywhere else, fell away 
to ... 

Nothing. 

He stared at it, trying o pene- 
trate it. 

It could be fog. It was gray like 
fog. But if it was, it was fog be- 
hind glass. Down the slope, steeper 
than anything he had seen so far, 
only a quarter of a mile away. 
Limbo ended in gray mist. 

Despite his misgiving — he found 



7 




he had a caveman’s fear of rolling 
down the slope and over a cliff 
edge into a bottomless chasm — he 
descended the slope. 

The vegetation he saw on the 
way down was sparser and tougher 
than any he had seen anywhere 
else. Life here, behind the streams, 
was a struggle. Indeed, only the 
birds and the wiry grass and scrub 
found the struggle worth while. 
There were nests everywhere. The 
birds had had the sense to nest in 
the one place shunned by all the 
other inhabitants of Limbo. 

The slope evened out at the bot- 
tom. There was a ten-yard track 
facing the wall. It was impossible 
not to think of it as a wall, al- 
though as he stood facing it, three 
feet from it, he couldn’t be sure 
there was anything solid there at 
all. 

Nothing grew within ten yards 
of it. A twig thrown at the wall 
bounced back, proving that it was 
some kind of barrier. 

He went closer still and cautious- 
ly touched the wall. It gave slight- 
ly, with no sensation of touch, and 
then his hand was stopped. 

The wall ran at first sight ab- 
solutely straight. Close to it, he 
found it curved gently. Probably it 
made a perfect circle . looking 
up and guessing the shape of the 
wall higher up by the part he 
could see before it disappeared in- 
to what he had assumed to be 
open sky, he saw no reason why it 



could not be a truly perfect dome. 

He was a prisoner. 

He had been doomed to solitary 
confinement in an idyllic world. 
And he wondered — what was his 
sin? 

'^hree days later, early in the 
^ morning, he was back at the 
mound of stones he had built to 
mark his starting point. Circling 
the outer limit of Limbo, he had 
walked about fifty miles, he judged, 
not counting the forays over the 
hill for food. 

The bare track inside the wall 
never rose or fell the whole way 
round by as much as a foot. Inside 
the flat outer ring, close to the 
wall, all the way round, hills rose 
steeply to form a saucer with the 
lake in the middle. 

If Limbo was a prison, it was a 
fairly generous prison, its area being 
something over 150 square miles. 
His preliminary estimates indicated 
that the diameter was about four- 
teen miles. 

However, he was no longer so 
sure that Limbo was a prison. 

At six points on the perimeter, in 
the wall that wasn’t there, about 
twenty feet up, were curious inde- 
terminate circular areas about three 
feet across. Although they were 
faintly purple rather than gray or 
blue, their hue and texture were not 
sufficiently different from the bar- 
rier in which they were set for them 
to be noticeable from any distance. 

IF

And yet they looked like holes or 
doorways. He was sufficiently sure 
of their nature to name them Gate- 
ways. 

Having established the limits of 
his domain, he sought a new point 
of departure — and found it at 
once. 

At his awakening he had com- 
pletely ignored the area where he 
found himself. There just might be 
something there. Footprints . 
some manufactured thing like a pin, 
a cigarette butt, a match, an empty 
can or packet. 

Could he find the place? Already, 
having explored perhaps one per 
cent of the available area, he was 
developing a sense of direction 
which might come from his naked- 
ness and vulnerability, or might de- 
pend on something he had not con- 
sciously noticed. Of course he could 
find the place. 

It didn’t seem to take long, al- 
though it must have been three or 
four hours. He knew that civilized 
people, as he had been once, were 
ruled by time. But he no longer 
worshipped time. There was a glut 
of time in Limbo. 

He found with no difficulty the 
glade where, for him, life began. 
But there was nothing to see. His 
own bare feet had made no marks 
on the ground, and there was no 
other marks. 

If he had crawled or staggered 
there, where had he come from? Al- 
most certainly up the hill a little. 



He took a few cautious steps. 
And found the house. 

II 

T he house shattered all his 
theories. Entirely out of place 
in a world which had no other 
artifact, it was set there firmly and 
boldly in a clearing which could be- 
come a garden. 

The front door was open. 
Memory did not stir. He was 
sure he had never set eyes on 
the house. 

He approached the house slowly. 
The big windows were clean. There 
was no smog to make them filthy. 
Small animals and birds treated the 
house exactly like any other inani- 
mate object. The birds rested on 
the roof when they felt like it, the 
hares ran within inches of the walls. 

But no creature approached the 
open door. 

When he reached it, he found out 
why. In the doorway he felt some- 
thing which harmed him not at 
all, but made him shiver and told 
him to be afraid. Being a man, he 
shivered and refused to be afraid. 
Animals and birds would react dif- 
ferently. 

He entered, and the feeling dis- 
solved. He had crossed the invisible 
barrier. 

Wherever he moved in the house, 
there was light. If he went naked 
from now on, it would be from 
choice. A complete wardrobe of 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



9 




clothes was only one of the things 
the house provided. It had every- 
thing — furniture, beds with sheets 
and blankets, a fully equipped 
kitchen, a well stocked larder, hot 
and cold water, a library, and a 
workshop at the back which con- 
tained not only every hand tool and 
power tool he could imagine himself 
needing, and many whose purpose 
he didn’t know, but also stacks of 
wood sawn into planks and beams, 
huge sheets of plywood and hard- 
board, metal tubing, brackets, posts, 
girders, rolls of felt, plastic sheet- 
ing, tarpaulin. 

He went back to the kitchen, 
hungry as he always was. Only 
once in his six days in Limbo had 
he felt really satisfied — after kill- 
ing and wolfing the hare. Now he 
could gorge himsef until he 
couldtft move. There was an electric 
cooker, a refrigerator humming 
quietly, and although nothing here 
could be fresh, he was sure that all 
the canned and preserved stores 
would be in perfect condition. 

In that workshop it would take 
him only a few minutes to fashion 
a bow as strong as he could pull 
and some wicked, deadly arrows. 
Deer were so plentiful and so un- 
afraid that he could get so dose 
to a buck it would be impossible to 
miss. 



A nticipation of cooking and eai- 
^ ing fresh meat was exquisite 
torture . but there was a mirror 



10 



on one wall of the kitchen, and 
catching sight of himself in it he 
decided there were things to be done 
even before he ate. 

After bathing, shaving, trimming 
his hair and nails, he looked more 
closely at the clothes in the ward- 
robe. He went the length of starting 
to dress himself in a suit, with socks 
and a shirt and a tie, before re- 
belling and putting on only a pair 
of khaki shorts and soft leather 
sandals. In Limbo, that was all 
even a civilized man needed to 
wear. 

Then, still hungry, he examined 
the other bedrooms, those he had 
previously dismissed with a glance 
after finding the one he wanted, 
the one that was his. Only two 
were ready for immediate occupan- 
cy, as his had been. 

In the vast wardrobes of the two 
that were ready, he foimd women’s 
dothes, in every variety and style 
known to him, dothes not for one 
woman but for two, dothes that 
only young and attractive women 
wodd wear .... 

Suddenly he found himself sweat- 
ing. 

A man could face what he had 
to face. A man could see himself 
living until he died, alone, with 
only pigs and diickens for com- 
pany. A man could face that as he 
could face life with one leg, with 
one eye, with no eyes. 

But when hope opened the 
door .... He discarded the evi- 



IF 




dence that there were te be two 
women and thought only of one. 
Could he have missed a girl who 
had come to life as he had come 
to life, at about the same time? 
Undoubtedly he could. In an area 
of 150 square miles two individuals 
could blunder about for months 
without becoming aware of each 
other’s existence. 

She had to be here. If there was 
any justice, any hope, any happi- 
ness. She had to be here. 

But She was not in the house. 
He prowled through it again. On 
the ground floor he tried doors 
he had not yet opened. After a 
while he feund the one he wanted. 

Stone steps led down into a cel- 
lar. Although the cellar was bare 
and cold compared with the rest 
of the house, lights went on as he 
opened the door. 

He went down the steps. In the 
cellar, which was not large, were 
three things. They lay side by 
side on stone plinths. They were 
coffins. 

They were coffins in shape, 
with brass plates, which he could 
see while still halfway up the 
stairs, set in the polished wood. 
But each had one thing he had 
never seen on any coffin — a 
glass faceplate where the head 
should be. 

He approached the first casket 
cautiously, unafraid but not wish- 
ing to spy on death. On the brass 
plate in plain letters was the one 

SIX GATES T€> LIMBO 



word Rex. There was nothing be- 
hind the faceplate. And without 
thinking he touched the lid and 
found he could open it on a hinge. 

The case was empty. He had a 
name. He was Rex. 

He moved to the next casket and 
scarcely had to look at the plate 
to know what it said: Regina, A 
moment later he was gazing at her 
through the faceplate. 

'^his was She, sleeping so much 
as the Sleeping Beauty always 
lay in illustrations in children’s 
books that he put out his hand to 
raise the lid and kiss her to rouse 
her. This lid, however, didn’t budge. 

She was a pretty blonde, her 
head so small and her features so 
so fine and delicate that she must 
be tiny, slim, soft, the most femi- 
nine kind of woman. Because she 
was tiny, he could see her bare 
shoulders through the glass, and 
they were shaped to inflame a man. 
Her hair was pure gold, her skin, 
as much of it as he could see, ex- 
quisite. 

Regina. She. And as lovely a She 
as he could have hoped for. 

At the thought he became in- 
tensely curious about the third 
box. What, logically, could it con- 
tain? A child? A dog? 

He padded across and looked. 

He caught his breath. 

Regina was pretty. She was the 
prettiest girl he had ever seen. 
Yet she remained a pretty girl. 



11 




This was a very beautiful woman. 

On the brass plate was engraved: 
Venus. 

Between the two cases he stood 
uncomprehendingly. He had want- 
ed a woman, wanted her with a 
longing which no one but another 
castaway could ever appreciate. 
He had felt, somehow, that in 
the nature of this environment, 
there must be a She. 

But why two of them? 

It was obvious that he was not 
meant to burst open the caskets. 
His own had opened from inside; 
the others would do the same if 
they opened at all. 

The labels, rather than names, 
Rex and Regina, he accepted easi- 
ly. He was prepared to be Rex 
of Limbo and call his consort 
Regina. She had to be his consort 
— their labels united them. 

But what of Venus? All the indi- 
cations were that Venus was not 
meant for him. Then who was she 
meant for? 

The puzzle diverted him so much 
that he climbed out of the cellar 
and sought information in the 
small library he had seen, a case 
of books in the main lounge in the 
center of the house, windowless. 

There were only about a hun- 
dred of them, neatly filling foiu: 
shelves in a glass-fronted book- 
case. Reference books of various 
sizes came first on each shelf, then 
non-fiction, then literature, then 
whatever was left. There was a 



dictionary, a one-volume encyclo- 
pedia, a book of facts and figures, 
an atlas, a medical dictionary, an 
outline of history. There was a 
book of seven-figure mathematical 
tables, a dictionary of music, an 
encyclopedia of art, a cookery book, 
a book on gardening, an album of 
flora and fauna. The Bible was 
there and the Koran. 

Almost all the books were brand 
new, untouched. The last date he 
found was 3646. They cracked and 
rustled as he handled them, never 
having been opened. It was only 
by chance that a flyleaf fell open 
and he found that every book had 
a printed stick-on label reading: 
Section K, Department of Educa-^ 
tion and Science, London, Earth. 

So he was a guinea pig. He had 
suspected it. 

Suddenly he went rigid, all his 
senses bent on what had alerted 
him. 

Steps in the hall. Human foot- 
steps. 

'^hen as he listened to the steps, 
and thought, he relaxed de- 
liberately and forced himself to 
stay where he was, although the 
temptation to leave the books and 
investigate was strong. 

When he entered the celler, he 
had broken a contact, let fresh air 
in, or in some other way threw a 
switch. A few minutes later Re- 
gina awoke, as he had awakened, 
and did as he must have done — 



12 



IF 




Ill 



crawled up the stairs, staggered 
outside and a little way down the 
hill, and rested, perhaps slept, in a 
glade. 

He hoped fervently it was Re- 
gina and not Venus. He could not 
see any point in the presence of 
yenus. He could see many good 
reasons for the presence of Regina, 
however. 

He didn^t follow her, didn’t 
force his presence and assistance 
on her. He had been allowed all the 
time he needed to orient himself 
in Limbo, and Regina should have 
the same. 

Venus as well as Regina might have 
awakened. He turned to the books 
again. The dictionary told him Ve- 
nus was the goddess of love in Ro- 
man mythology, equated with the 
Greek Aphrodite, which he knew. 
It also told him she represented 
sexual love, amorous desires or in- 
fluences. 

But her personal history did 
not seem particularly relevant. He 
took it for granted that he was not 
in any real sense a king nor Re- 
gina a queen, and that Venus was 
a label rather than an incarnation 
of a being who had never existed 
anyway. 

Yet labels meant something. His 
and Regina’s meant they were hus- 
band and wife, and he assumed they 
would be, although he had no rec- 
ollection of ever seeing Regina 
before. Why was the other woman 
labeled Venus? 



R egina already knew she was 
Regina and that there was a 

Rex. 

For her, awakening was a far 
greater ordeal than for Rex, yet 
more complete more quickly. From 
the very first her mind was dear. 
She got out of the case, with an 
effort that exhausted her so much 
that she had to cling to the case, 
her head reeling, only because she 
was sick and did not want to be 
sick in a box. After a few seconds 
she managed to shut the case so 
that she could lean over it, and 
it was then that she saw her name. 

Curiosity impelled her, though 
all she wanted was oblivion to end 
her agony, to stagger to the next 
box. Thus she found that Rex was 
already awake. Then she had to 
totter across to the third box. 

It was the sight of Venus that 
made her dedde to live, after all. 
Until she saw her, all Regina want- 
ed was to climb back in her case 
hoping that she would lose con- 
sciousness again. But now she knew 
she was Regina and there was a 
Rex, both of them awake, and Ve- 
nus was still asleep. It became nec- 
essary to stay awake. 

She managed to reach the stairs 
and began to climb them, half 
crawling. The greater warmth at 
the top was the first thing to bring 
her some semblance of pleasure; 
the torture eased slightly. 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO

It did not occur to her, finding 
herself in a house, to stagger out 
of it. Instead she went to the 
stairs and began to climb them, 
appreciating the softness and 
warmth of the carpeting after the 
hard cold floor of the cellar under 
her bare feet. 

After ten minutes in the bath- 
room a second thing happened to 
give her the will to live. The first 
had been the realization that an- 
other woman was ready to step in 
if she refused to take her place in 
whatever situation existed here. 
The second was her first conscious 
sight of herself in a full-length 
mirror. 

Her mood changed gradually but 
steadily as she looked. She was not 
only pretty. The slim, small body 
which had been giving her hell was 
exactly what she would have ad- 
mired jealously if another girl 
possessed it. She could wear any- 
thing or nothing and need no as- 
sistance from what she wore. 

TJ ex scarcely realized it was the 
sixth or seventh time he had 
returned to stare down at the love- 
ly Venus, or how long he had spent 
staring. He bent closer to examine 
her. There was the faintest breath 
of movement. She wasn’t exactly 
breathing, yet she wasn’t as still 
and rigid as stone. 

”Try kissing the glass,” a voice 
said acidly. ” Maybe that will do 
it.” 



He spun round. Only a couple of 
yards from him was Regina, cool 
and completely in command of her- 
self, wearing a pink patterned dress 
and high-heeled shoes. She had 
done something to her hair, too. 

Hello, Regina,” he said. ^^You 
look wonderful.” 

know. But thanks for notic- 
ing.” 

''You seem to have recovered a 
lot quicker than I did.” 

"I don’t think I’ll ever recover. 
I still feel like death.” 

"You went out, you were . 
sick?” 

"Please,” she said coldly. "We 
don’t know each other. Let’s leave 
the intimate details until later — 
much later — if ever. Anyway, I 
didn’t go outside. Why should I?” 
"No reason — ” 

"Never mind. Tell me what this 
is all about.” 

"I don’t know what this is all 
about.” But he told her what he 
did know, concluding: "Apparent- 
ly we’re guinae pigs of a sort, per- 
haps watched all the time, perhaps 
watched only when we try to get 
out of Limbo — ” 

"We can get out?” Regina said 
sharply. He had not mentioned the 
Gateways so far. 

"In time. With some effort . 
I think. But the point is — ” 
"Let’s get one thing clear,” said 
Regina. "I may be ignorant. I may 
be only Regina to your Rex.” She 
glanced without enthusiasm at Ve- 

IF

nus in her case. ''I may be only 
half your weight, so you can knock 
me about whenever you feel like 
it. We may have been thrown to- 
gether by a couple of names on 
boxes. But I will not stand for any 
man, even the only man in the place 
I happen to be in, telling me what 
is and what is not the point. I can 
think. I can add two and two and 
get any number I happen to fancy. 
If there are only two of us here — ” 
she cast another brooding glance at 
the third case — '^before we go 
any further, that doesn’t automati- 
cally mean that I’m your wife. 
Still less does it mean I’m yom 
squaw, and most definitely I’m not 
part of the interior plumbing. Is 
that clear?” 

"'Not entirely.” 

right, I’ll put it plainer — ” 
^'No don’t bother. I think I 
caught the gist.” 

”Well you could have put more 
clothes on,” said Regina unsympa- 
thetically. '^I did.” 

“Hungry,” he asked. “Let’s raid 
the kitchen.” 

She saw nothing to argue about 
in that, and they went up the stairs, 
shutting the cellar door behind 
them. 

S he knew her way around a kitch- 
en. A few quick glances into 
cupboards, drawers and the big re- 
frigerator seemed to tell her ex- 
actly what was there and what was 
not. 



“The potatoes look all ri^t, but 
there are no fresh vegetables,” she 
said. “Theres no parsley growing 
around here, but there’s mint at the 
back of the house — ” 

His eyes narrowed. “How do you 
know?” 

“What?” 

“You haven’t been out.” 

“Well do you always have to go 
and look before you know what you 
are going to find?” 

“Yes.” 

She shrugged. “Anyway, there’s 
mint at the back of the house. 
Will you get it, or do I have to 
go for it myself?” 

“ AU right.” 

He left her in the kitchen and 
went out to the back of the house. 
Here a vegetable garden had been 
set out at one time, but it had not 
been tended for years. The rhubarb 
was plentiful and good. Very little 
else was. The mint was usable. 

When he returned to the kitchen, 
he found Regina, an apron over her 
pink dress, coping competently with 
about a dozen things at once. 

“Thanks,” she said, accepting the 
mint. “Now go and get washed. 
Dinner in twenty minutes.” 

After he showered, there was time 
to go down to the cellar and see if 
there was any change in Venus. Ve- 
nus was still the same. 

“Do you want your dinner in 
here?” Regina asked tartly. 

Again she was just behind him, 
and he hadn’t heard her. 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO

Regina/’ he said firmly, ^Hhere 
are only three human beings in this 
little world. What do you want to 
do about Venus? Kill her?” 

'^The thought hadn’t actually oc- 
curred to me. But I’ll give it due 
consideration.” 

The meal was very good. 

That night, after a day of hard 
work in which Regina proved her- 
self not only practical but also a 
consummate expert in finding work 
for idle hands to do, it was she who 
said, carelessly, without thinking: 
"Let’s go to bed.” 

"Let’s,” he said. 

She looked at him broodingly. 
"No, not together,” she said. "Def- 
initely not together.” 

"You think you could stop me?” 
“No. But I’d try.” 

He didn’t try her door later. It 
did occur to him to go down and 
have another look at Venus. But 
Regina would know. 

IV 

^^hey worked hard for six days 
and then, by tacit consent, ob- 
served a day of rest. 

There were two main areas of 
friction between them. One of them 
arose from the fact that neither 
was made for simple friendliness 
with the opposite sex. The other 
area of friction was the Gateways. 

"Maybe you want to escape from 
a place like this, but I don’t,” Re- 
gina said. 



"I don’t want to escape. If those 
spots really are Gateways, they 
have to be investigated. That’s ob- 
vious.” 

"Don’t tell me,” said Regina 
crossly, "what is and what is not 
obvious.” 

"Well, I’m a big, healthy fellow, 
and I need a woman. If I can’t get 
one in Limbo — ” 

"Stick to the subject. Why are 
you obsessed with the idea of get- 
ting away from here?” 

Very mildly Rex said: "I’m not 
obsessed with anything. You’re do- 
ing all the protesting. Why not tell 
me quietly, calmly, why you re- 
fuse even to think about going 
through a Gateway away from 
here?” 

She didn’t hit the roof. She nev- 
er did. Often she seemed on the 
point of losing her temper, of hit- 
ting him or throwing things, but 
she was too innately practical to do 
anything of so little practical value. 

"Well, some day I want to go 
back to Earth,” she said. "I think 
everybody does and always will.” 

He was interested. For her the 
barrier between what she knew and 
didn’t quite know had always been 
more easily broken down than for 
him. She knew more than he did. 

"I’m in no hurry,” she said. "I 
said some day. Earth’s the only 
place I might leave here to go to, 
and I’d want to come back. There’s 
peace here, and purpose. It’s a place 
so much better than anywhere else 

IF 



16 




I ever heard of that 1 think it’s 
crazy to leave it voluntarily.” 

'^You don’t mind being alone 
here?” 

'^I’m not exactly alone. Only half 
alone. You’re here.” 

After that the conversation peter- 
ed out in their other area of fric- 
tion. 

On the seventh day, they took a 
basket, which Rex carried, and a 
beach bag, which Regina slimg over 
her shoulder, closed the house door 
and set out. 

Rex, as usual, wore shorts and 
sandals. Regina, for the first time, 
was dressed frankly frivolously. 
^'Very nice,” he said when he first 
saw her. 

”Well, there’s no need to rave 
about it all day,” she retorted. 

Still, you noticed. I was beginning 
to think if I wanted any atten- 
tion I’d have to wear nothing but 
a gold chain around my waist and 
bring a panther on a lead.” 

They were walking down the 
slope, and this meant they were 
bound to reach the lake. Before they 
reached it, however, they struck 
off to the right to skirt the shorter 
arm of the lake and reach the other 
side, where, Regina said never 
having been there,” there was a soft 
grass clearing nearly a mile square 
with deep water for swimming right 
up to the two-foot bank. 

^'Regina, you see things,” said 
Rex. ^'You know things. If I asked 
you what the country was like two 



miles from here you could tell me, 
though you’ve never been th«o— ” 
''Well, can’t you?” 

"No. I had to explore this ]dace 
before I knew an 3 rthing about it. 
And I haven’t really explored more 
than about a tenth of it yet.” 
"You don’t know what you’re 
going to see until you see it?” 

"No. Never. Now — ” 

"Yes?” 

"Tell me about the Gateways and 
the wall.” 

4C'll^ell?” she said coldly. Every 
time the Gateways were 
mentioned they ended up argimig. 

"You can sense them, can’t 
you?” 

"The wall, not what you call 
Gateways.” 

"Can’t you see through the 
Gateways? Beyond the wall? I^t- 
side here?” 

She paused and then said quiet- 
ly: "No.” 

"No?” 

"Nothing. Blankness.” 

He would have said more, but 
he didn’t want an argument on this 
day of rest. 

When they reached their destina- 
tion it was exactly as Regina had 
described it, even to the huge 
boulder resting on the bank of the 
lake. 

She waved at it. "You change 
on this side, and I’ll change on the 
other,” she said. 

He stared at her rather blankly. 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO

aU right,” said Regina 
sweetly. «If you didn’t think of it, 
X did.” She opened her beach bag 
and handed him trunks wrapped in 
a towel. Then she went behind the 
rock. 

^Rex changed into the briefs and 
dived in. Only a moment later Re- 
gina in the water beside him. 

It surprised him that she swam so 
badly. But he saw, not being in- 
sensitive, that she was on the de- 
fensive, daring him to jeer at her 
and frankly terrified, though she 
would never admit it, that he would 
use his infinitely superior power and 
skill in the water to frighten and 
humiliate her. He was therefore 
gentle and understanding, ignoring 
her clumsiness in the water (the 
only time he had ever seen her 
looking clumsy). 

Of course Regina then went to 
the other extreme and complained: 
''I’m not a baby, you know. I won’t 
drown. You don’t have to treat me 
as if I were made of paper.” 

"No, Regina,” he said gently, in- 
furiating her. 

Yet they were laughing when 
they chmbed out, shaking the wa- 
ter from their hair . then the 
laughter died. If she wished to 
maintain the status quo, Rex 
thought, she would have been wise 
not to go swimming with him. 

In her face, as the laugh died, 
was awareness, awareness of her- 
self, awareness of him. Only by a 
great effort did he manage to re- 



strain himself — and the next in- 
stant, when the moment had pass- 
ed and they both knew it, he re- 
alized he had been wrong, he should 
not have fought the impulse down; 
the door had been opened for a mo- 
ment, but now it was shut. 

They , sat down and ate, saying 
little, Regina’s eyes faintly mock- 
ing. Presently, with a sigh, she lay 
back on the grass and went to sleep 
instantly. 

Rex moved to sit over her. Her 
flesh was warm, but surely not 
warm enough to burn his hand so. 
He traced her contours, learning 
her, remembering they had touch- 
ed only a few times, by accident, 
while working together. She slept 
on, but he was no longer over- 
scrupulous, afraid of making a 
wrong move. She smiled in her 
sleep, and her body began to move 
under his hands. 

Then she was awake, easily, still 
smiling, and it was all right. 

\ fterwards everything was dif- 
ferent, as they had both 
known it would be. 

"Now we’re really Rex and Re- 
gina,” said Rex smugly. 

She merely grunted. 

"Regina . what about chil- 
dren?” 

'^What about them?” she asked. 

"Are you scared here, only with 
me?” 

"I expect we’ll cope. If you mean 
do I want children, I think the 

IF 



18 




question scarcely arises. In a place 
like this we can^t not have children, 
surely?” 

He kissed her again, fighting 
down his reawakening desire. Some- 
thing had to be said. The two peo- 
ple in a tiny world must never have 
things between them that could not 
be spoken of. 

Quietly he told her: ”I’m going 
through the first Gateway tomor- 
row.” 

She froze. ^^Well. I see I’m going 
to have something really special in 
the way of hone3mioons.” 

^^What do you mean? I may only 
be gone five minutes.” 

"Or five years, or forever. Why 
not be content with what we have 
here?” 

"Because the Gateways exist,” 
he said patiently. 

"You mean you’re one of thosfi 
idiots who have to go aroimd 
climbing mountains because they’re 
there?” she demanded. 

"Maybe I am.” 

She jumped up and rather cross- 
ly started putting on her clothes. 

Rex got up too. "Don’t do that,” 
he said. 

"Why not?” 

"Ask a silly question,” he said, 
"and you don’t always get a silly 
answer.” 

This time she welcomed him with 
a passion that startled him. 

4 4 T wouldn’t trust myself on 

^ that,” said Regina rather sul- 



lenly, looking critically at the spi- 
dery stairway. 

She had openly hoped it would 
take Rex so long and would prove 
so difficult to make a stairway 
which could be carried to the north 
wall and set up there that he would 
give up the idea. However, a few 
hours’ work the evening before had 
sufficed for him to make the stair- 
way. 

"It’s not only strong enough to 
bear my weight, but secure enough 
to support me if I have to lower 
myself twenty feet on the other 
side.” 

"You think you’ll have to?” 

"No. I believe that’s a matter- 
transference field up there.” 

"What’s that?” 

"I don’t know anything about 
it, beyond that, and there’s nothing 
in the books — I looked. But that’s 
what I think those Gateways are 
doorways to six spots that could 
be anywhere in the galaxy.” 

The stairway was a framework 
of metal tubing, made in sections 
now securely bolted together. At the 
top was a wooden platform with 
metal rails round it on three sides, 
set within an inch of the wall. 

He wore plain gray overalls, with 
a shirt and shorts underneath. He 
reckoned this gave him the best 
chTance of passing muster in an en- 
vironment which could be absolute- 
ly anything. 

"I’ll come with you if you like,” 
Regina said ungraciously. 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



19 




“N#. You stay here, Regina.” 
”Wky don’t you want me to 
come?” she demanded. 

'^Because we don’t know any- 
thing about this. The Gateways may 
be nothing but spots on the wall. 
They may be doors leading only 
to empty space, and I’ll die the 
moment I go through.” 

She shuddered. "I’m not staying 
here alone. If you’re not back in 
twenty-four hours, I’m coming af- 
ter you.” 

"No, Regina,” he said sharply. 
"I may be delayed, injured, cap- 
tured, anything. I’ll get back, I 
promise, if it’s possible to get back. 
But it may be days, weeks.” 

After making her promise to 
wait at least twenty days before 
even thinking of following him 
through the Gateway, he kissed her 
and turned to the stairway. She 
spim him back and kissed him 
fiercely. "You don’t think you’re 
getting away just like that, do 
you?” she demanded. "A brotherly 
kiss, with your mind on the other 
side of the Gateway — ” 

Like thousands of other women 
throughout history, she put every- 
thing she had into dcla3dng his de- 
parture. And like most of them, 
she succeeded. 

But afterwards, he really did go. 
At the top, he fastened one 
end of the coil of nylon rope he had 
round his waist to one of the rails 
round the platform. Then, with a 
wave, he touched the Gateway. 



He felt a violent tug at his 
middle. Then nothing. 

V 

A fter a time that was neither 
heaven nor hell, and a period 
that was pure hell, he awoke to full 
consciousness in a not-so-gentle 
world. 

This time he was lying on rough, 
hard, gravel-mud, stone-clay ground 
in what was obviously a disused 
quarry. There was a sun in this sky, 
gray and leaden though it was, and 
from its position behind the clouds, 
just dropping behind the ravished 
walls of the quarry, it would set 
pretty soon. He was cold and there 
was rain in the air. The temperature 
was nearly twenty degrees lower 
than in Limbo. 

But this was less important than 
the discovery that matter-transfer- 
ence was similar to the unpleasant 
rebirth process that he and Re- 
gina had gone through once and 
had somehow expected would never 
have to go through again. 

The rope was neatly severed, as 
if cut. Apparently you could take 
things through the Gateway, but 
they could not be attached to any- 
thing in Limbo. Before he could 
move, he had to be sure he could 
return to exactly this spot, or he’d 
never be able to return to Limbo. 

Behind him there was no sign of 
any Gateway. Terror gripped him, 
but he calmed himself. The Gate- 



20 



IF 




way, though there was no visible 
sign of it, must be immediately be- 
hind him. He scraped away a lit- 
tle of the broken stone, sand, soil 
and moss to make doorposts for the 
invisible doorway, a guide to him 
and to no one else. Then he felt 
it safe to move away. 

On three sides the walls of stone 
and earth rose to fifty or sixty feet. 
On the fourth, a former access road 
was blocked by thin scrub, and 
from that direction he now heard 
a heavy rolling sound. 

Then he turned and saw the high- 
way. 

Beyond the line ef shrubbery a 
rough barbed-wire fence had been 
erected, probably to keep children 
out of an obvious danger spot. The 
significance of all this was not lost 
on'him: the Gateway was carefully 
located in a place useless to every- 
one, shut off, with no shelter, 
buildings or huts to attract even 
vagrants. 

Scaling the fence presented dif- 
ficulties. Fortunately, he still had 
most of his rope witii him, the only 
thing he did have except for his 
clothes and a clasp knife. Looping 
the rope over one of the metal sup- 
ports, he climbed up and jumped 
down on the other side. He hid the 
rope at the foot of the fence. 

It was immense. Lanes stretched 
as far as he could see in the misty 
dusk. Although he could not count 
the lanes, they were aU one-way. So 
probably somewhere else there was 



a similar vast highway leading the 
other way. 

There were huge articulated 
trucks which despite their vastness 
must be doing a hundred miles an 
hour. There were slower, lumber- 
ing lorries which looked like cattle- 
trucks. There were little flashing 
cars which sped like arrows across 
the plain. 

Only a mile or two away, a city 
began. He thought of it as begin- 
ning, because he could see well 
enough that it had a beginning — 
the first houses, halls and church- 
es, with lamps already beginning to 
glow. But he could see nothing to 
indicate that the city ever ended. 

It spread in both directions into 
the gloom. It could not, he guessed, 
have fewer than 10,000,000 inhabi- 
tants Indeed, since he had to guess, 
with the volume of traffic to help 
him to guess, he estimated the pop- 
ulation at more like 100,000,000. 

An hour later he reached the first 
buildings. The street lamps were 
lit, but this vast city was evidently 
a place where public light was 
doled out parsimoniously. 

T Te waited until he saw people in 
^ ^ the streets. They were two- 
legged, two-armed, and some of 
them were in overalls. It seemed 
safe to proceed. 

Nobody looked at him. He passed 
a sign that said simply MERCURY. 
It must be the name of the town, 
incongruous as it was. Certainly it 

IF 



22 




was not on the planet Mercury.' 

Although he entered the city on 
the same level as the road, he 
presently found himself on a walk- 
way which overlooked it, or part 
of it. Below was a one-way tunnel 
roadway, only three-lanes, along 
which cars and trucks raced into 
the city. Their speed was uniform, 
and the path they took so precise 
that there could be no doubt con- 
trol was automatic. 

Most of the other pedestrians 
were hurrying. The people were 
dressed quite unremarkably in rath- 
er drab garments suited to the cli- 
mate, with no difference whatever 
between the sexes. All wore tunics 
and slacks. 

He had seen one sign, the one 
that read Mercury. Now he saw an- 
other. Starkly it warned, in flam- 
ing red letters: DOOMSDAY IS 
NEAR. That was all. There was no 
indication whether it was intend- 
ed to be taken literally or evange- 
listically. And nobody looked at it. 

He would have liked to stop 
somebody, anybody, and speak to 
him. But for all he knew, that might 
mean instant arrest. Maybe he was 
supposed to have a work card or 
curfew permit or at least identifi- 
cation. 

Only a little way into the city, 
the walkways became canopied. He 
was fortunate in reaching the first 
canopy just as the rain began. 

The lighting was uniform, always 
adequate, nowhere real^ bright. 
SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



Shop windows, increasingly com- 
moner as he penetrated from the 
outskirts, were lit dimly. He would 
have liked to enter any building, 
a shop or bar or house, but having 
no money he decided to go on un- 
til he found a public reading-room, 
library or even toilet, where he 
could get some idea what a Mercu- 
rian interior was like. 

Again he came to a sign giving 
blazing warning: DOOMSDAY IS 
NEAR. This time he noticed that 
people passing it didn’t ignore it. It 
was moire than that. They were de- 
liberately blind to it, knowing it was 
there and being careful not to see 
it. 

Although from outside the city 
he had seen many steeples and tow- 
ers which he had taken for church- 
es, he had not yet passed one. 
Presently he did see a church, but 
it was on the opposite walkway. 

Even from the opposite walkway, 
and in the poor light, he could read 
the text on the church’s billboard. 
It was DOOMSDAY IS NEAR. 

So the text was evangelical. Peo- 
ple were being frightened into the 
churches, as they had been in the 
Dark Ages. 

Now perhaps two miles into the 
city, he came to a crossway, no 
mere bridge but a walk\.ay going 
at right angles between buildings, 
with no road beneath. He took it 
because the route he had been fol- 
lowing had shown him nothing very 
new for a long time. 



23 




Scarcely anyone was walking 
here. Presently the walkway curved 
over another lower-level road, but 
this one seemed more like a rail- 
way without rails. The long green 
cars were imiform, there was two- 
way traffic, and they moved at the 
same speed in exactly the same 
track. 

Here there was nobody at all, ex- 
cept a small girl leaning over the 
rail on the opposite side — engaged 
in the age-old children’s pastime 
of looking at the trains, Rex 
thought. He took his eye off her for 
a moment. 

When he looked back, drawn by 
a movement, he shouted involun- 
tarily. 

She had one thin leg over the 
rail and was swinging the other 
over. Although she must have heard 
his shout, she didn’t look at him. 
She was looking down at the trains. 
Calmly, as one approached, she 
launched herself out and fell with 
apparent slowness right into the 
path of the car. She hit the ground, 
and the train hit her in the same 
instant. There was no noise above 
the rumbling purr of the car, no 
scream; and after it had happened 
nothing remained down there but 
a small stain, gleaming dimly in 
the poor light. 

She could have been no more than 
nine or ten. 

T>efore he found the church, Rex 
saw another suicide. This one 



was public. In one of the bugj^ 
walkways a man of about thirty-ii 
five, alone, suddenly leaned over thi| 
rail, pivoting on his stomach, and[ 
fell headfirst to dash his brainflj 
on the road below. 

What shocked Rex most about if 
was the indifference of the citizens.; 
A few, mildly curioys, looked over 
the rail to check that the man was 
writhing about with broken limbs 
and a broken back. 

Traffic control knew about it at 
once. Every vehicle detoured the 
fallen body. Close to the edge of 
the road, it was not much of a nui- 
sance. Within three minutes an am- 
bulance, clearly marked with a red 
cross, drew up, and the traffic went 
round it too. How a casualty was 
picked up in Mercury was new to 
Rex.^It stopped over the body, and 
when it moved on a few seconds 
later, there was no sign that any- 
thing had been there, except a rec- 
tangle gleaming with liquid of some 
kind, probably disinfectant. 

Before he found the church, Rex 
had an encounter with a homicidal 
maniac. 

A shout alerted* him, and he turn- 
ed. 

The moment he turned, Rex 
knew that the man running at him 
with a breadknife was completely 
off his head. His wildly working 
face told the story. Something had 
snapped — suddenly. 

In the split seconds before the 
man rcach^ him, Rex was able 

IF 



24 




to observe from the reactions of 
the score or so people in the im- 
mediate vicinity that this was un- 
usual, this was shocking, this was 
frightening. People quietly killing 
themselves were barely worth a sec- 
ond glance. A man running amok 
with a breadknife was not, appar- 
ently commonplace in Mercury. 

There was time to sense this, but 
no time to be afraid. And then, 
as the man came nearer, there was 
no real need to be afraid, because 
he wasn’t coming for Rex at all. 
He was running past him, his quar- 
ry a little old lady who from her 
dazed, terrified yet puzzled expres- 
sion had never seen the maniac in 
his life. 

Rex didn’t think. As the man 
with the knife raced past him, Rex 
caught the arm holding the knife, 
diverted it upwards and used all 
his strength on the wrist. All his 
strength was not necessary. The 
knife dropped, as he had intended. 
He had not intended to break the 
man’s wrist and dislocate his shoul- 
der. 

In pain, the maniac whimpered 
and drooped. Sanity did not return. 
What returned was apathy. 

He was swept out of the way as 
quickly, cleanly and neatly as the 
man who had killed himself. Three 
men in white coats, summoned by 
means or persons unknown to Rex, 
arrived magically and took him into 
the nearest entrance. With them 
was a blue-suited man who had to 



be a policeman. To Rex’s astonish- 
ment, he didn’t speak to him at all, 
and only very briefly, one question 
and answer to the terrified old 
woman. Then the policeman nodded 
briefly at Rex, ten yards away, 
turned and picked up the knife and 
followed the others. 

That was it. The flow on the 
walkway resumed, and not one of 
the people concerned cast another 
glance at Rex. The old lady had 
hurried away the moment the po- 
lice let her go. 

Still wondering why he hadn’t 
even been asked his name, he saw 
something lying close to the wall, 
where it had been kicked in the 
brief struggle. He picked it up. 

It was the maniac’s wallet. 

There was nothing in it but pa- 
per money and coins. It was a purse 
rather than a wallet, not intended 
for anything other than money. 
There was no identification. 

In most other places in the galaxy 
a man openly picking up a purse 
would have attracted some atten- 
tion. In Mercury, nobody noticed. 
Nobody was interested. 

Rex hesitated for quite a while, 
the purse in his hand. Finally, not 
happy about it, he put it in his 
pocket. 

B efore he found the church, he 
was offered love, or what pass- 
ed for love in the walkways of Mer- 
cury. The girl simply caught his 
arm and looked at him, ignoring 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



25 




everybody else, and this happen- 
ed at a particularly busy spot. He 
smiled down at her, trying to ton 
her down gently without having to 
say a word. 

His smile inflamed her — she 
was not used to smiles like that. 
She pulled him to one of the box- 
es he had guessed to be tele- 
phone kiosks. They were. When she 
shut the door it locked. 

She put her hand to the zip of 
her tunic. Then, in the brighter 
light of the kiosk, she happened to 
see his eyes clearly. 

She froze. Twentyman,” she 
whispered. ''You should have told 
me.’^ 

The next instant she was out of 
the kiosk, letting it swing slowly 
shut behind her. Rex’s impression 
was that she was not terrified, not 
desperate to escape; she merely 
knew that no Twentyman, whoever 
or whatever that might be, could 
possibly be interested in her. 

Soon after leaving the booth he 
found the church. DOOMSDAY IS 
NEAR, the board announced. But 
if this was forbidding, the door was 
open and there was light within. 
Organ music rolled out to him. 

He entered. The church was vast. 
As he took in its immensity, he re- 
alized why he had taken so long 
to come on a church. If they were 
as big as this, not many would be 
needed. 

Vast as it was, and although no 
service was in progress and no min- 



ister present, it was well filled. Be- 
fore the many altars people knelt 
and crossed themselves. Thousands 
of candles blazed, as if the electric 
lighting were not fully adequate. 
Every moment hundreds entered 
and hundreds left. 

The decorations and ritual seem- 
ed overpoweringly Roman Catholic. 
At the thought of Catholicism, he 
watched the moving crowds for a 
pattern and presently saw, in addi- 
tion to the normal coming and go- 
ing, a steady procession to a large 
archway beside the main altar. 

Confession. There would be 
priests in there, evidently very 
many priests. 

Rex started for the doorway. He 
was no Catholic, but confession was 
privileged, wasn’t it? What would 
happen if he saw a priest and con- 
fessed he did not belong to this 
world and asked for information 
and advice? 

It would be interesting to find 
out. 

VI 

T Tis awakening in Limbo was the 
^ ^ worst of the three he had ex- 
perienced, but there was one good 
thing about it. Regina was there. 
She was crying. Vaguely he gath- 
ered he’d been gone seventeen days. 

Tiny as she was, she had virtual- 
ly carried him home and left him 
in the bathroom. 

An hour later, desperately tired 

IF 



26 




and weak^ but dean, he managed 
to stagger to bed. He was surprised 
and hurt that Regina wasn^t any- 
where upstairs. 

Then through his fatigue he 
sniffed and found energy enough to 
get out of bed again. Regina was 
cooking grilled steak. , 

He went down in his pajamas. 
When he arrived, Regina was pour- 
ing the wine. 

Much later, he was sufficiently 
restored to^talk. Indeed, after such 
a meal he didn’t feel inclined to 
move for at least an hour. 

He told her all the obvious things, 
and she listened, seldom asking 
questions. He told her he had seen 
three suicides. 

He told her more about his im- 
pressions of Mercury than the de- 
tails. ”It’s a sad, tired, aimless 
place. There’s nothing wrong, no op- 
pressive government, no war, no 
crime wave. Nobody’s starving and 
there are no problems, except ev- 
erything.” 

There must, be a reason. De- 
ficiency in air or food?” 

^'Deficiency in environment is 
my guess. Of course I don’t know 
any details of government, laws, 
sanctions, an 3 rthing like that. But 
how it looks is — nobody sees any 
future.” 

He paused and then said. "But 
the Twentymen exist. Perhaps they 
represent hope. 

"You haven’t told me about 
them.” 



"No. ... I told you that later, 
after seeing the priest, I was talk- 
ing in a bar to a girl who knew 
that another shot of pex would kill 
her, and took it. Well, after she 
died, a Twenty man came in to see 
what had happened. This one was a 
woman, an old woman. Twentymen 
can be men or women, young or old. 
When she came in, everybody knew 
about it.” 

"What did she look like?” 

"I don’t remember, and it didn’t 
matter.” 

"What are Twentymen?” 

"Special. You can see it and feel 
it. She came to me at once and 
said Twentyman? From where?’ 
I said nothing and just stared back 
at her.” 

"And then what?” 

"Then . practically nothing. 
She asked what had happened, 1 
told her, and she went away. Seems 
there’s a Twent 3 maan union. She 
was in no doubt that 1 was a 
Twent 3 onan — neither were the two 
others who looked into my eyes — 
and after that my business was my 
own and anything 1 said had to be 
the truth.” 

"Well, everybody knows you’re 
something very special indeed. You 
are Rex. Naturally you’re a Twen- 
tyman. One small question that 
crosses my mind — ” 

"Yes,” said Rex. 

"What exactly do you mean by 
yes?” 

"You’re a Twcntyman too.” 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



27 




S he was disconcerted. ''How do 
know?” 

He smiled. "Take it from me 
you are.” 

"Apart from the Twentymen as- 
pect, you paint a grim picture, 
Rex.” 

"There’s worse. I didn’t really 
tell you about the priest. I took a 
risk talking to him, telling him a 
little about this place, about you. 
I needn’t have worried. Nobody in 
Mercury cares enough to denounce 
anybody or persecute anybody or 
hound a stranger out of town. Be- 
sides, he knew I was a Twentyman. 
Everybody knows, unless you keep 
your eyes down or look blank. 

"What did he tell you about 
Twentymen?” 

"Nothing. He simply ignored my 
questions. But he told me a few 
tWngs, afterwards. I told him about 
the wallet, and he said in the cir- 
cumstances he didn’t think it would 
he very wrong if I used the mon- 
ey, which wasn’t much, to find out 
something about the city. So I 
4id, and I found the three things 
that seem to keep them going. They 
call them pex, lex and sex.” 

"One of them sounds normal.” 
"Not the way they go about it. 
Sex is purely for escape. That 
makes it the weakest and least re- 
liable of the three. You escape for 
only an infinitesimal fraction of 
your life. Pex is better. It’s a drug, 
not alcohol, though you drink it in 
a bar. It releases all the available 



reserves of happiness in a person. 
He’s happy for an hour or so. Then 
he has to pay. He’s more miserable 
than he dreamed of being. The ciure 
is time or another shot.” 

"Did you try it yourself?” 

"No. Maybe I should have. But 
I couldn’t take the chance of doing 
something crazy in Mercury.” 
"And they don’t ban this stuff?” 
Regina said wonderingly. 

"Ban many people’s hope of 
happiness?” 

"That leaves lex. Lex for law?” 
"Yes, but they use it in a spe- 
cial sense. They mean the law of 
God.” 

"Religion doesn’t seem to fit in 
the kind of environment you’ve been 
describing. But if they’re religious, 
doesn’t it help them?” 

"Not as it should, because they 
lean too heavily on it. God isn’t a 
staff and comfort. God has to be 
father, mother, doctor, nurse, con- 
fessor, crutch and sanctuary. Reli- 
gion doesn’t work for them, though 
they cling desperately to it, be- 
cause they put nothing into it, only 
take from it. Well, they give the 
church money — plenty of money. 
But that’s all they put in.” 
"Money? Aren’t they poor? I 
got the impression of a poor so- 
ciety.” 

"They’re poor in everything but 
money. Mercury is highly automat- 
ed, efficient. Unfortunately they 
don’t know how to take advantage 
of comparative affluence.”

Regina said: "You didn't tell me 
much about the priest. You said 
he told you a few things afterwards. 
After what?” 

"After I told him a little about 
this place and about you and me. 
He asked me a few questions. He 
was a good, patient man in his way. 
But when I'd answered his ques- 
tions and asked for his help, he 
stretched out his arms and said 
‘Help me.' '' 

VII 

'^he day after his return Rex 
went to the library to find 
out about Twentymen. And what 
he found was that the library con- 
tained no mention of Twentymen, 
in poetry, prose, fiction, history, 
anthropK)logy, sociology or anything 
else. 

He also found something he 
kicked himself for not noticing be- 
fore, because it must be important. 
Most of the books in the small li- 
brary were brand new, dated 3646. 
The others, those which were not 
brand new, were dated various years 
back to 3597. The point was that 
these books were encyclopedias, dic- 
tionaries, histories and other refer- 
ence books. 

For several weeks Rex and Re- 
gina worked hard until all that re- 
mained to be done in Limbo was 
maintenance. The subject of the 
Gateways was temporarily dropped. 
They stabled some cattle, fenced 

30 



others in, built a fish trap at the 
lake and started stocking a smaller 
pool near the house with trout. Al- 
though the most predatory birds, 
animals and fish had been kept 
out of this reserve when it was 
stocked, many of the creatures 
there were incapable of long-term 
survival without a guiding hand. 
Many of the things that grew, like- 
wise, needed cultivation. 

At first Rex had thought of the 
creatures of Limbo — whom he as- 
sumed to be Section K, London, 
Earth — as all-seeing, all knowing 
gods, trusting them to have made 
Limbo as perfect as it could be 
expected to be, trusting their as- 
sumed plan. 

But now he was no longer as 
trusting. Limbo was not the beauti- 
fully balanced sanctuary he had 
thought it to be. There should 
have been predators, after all, to 
keep the fish in check, the birds, 
the deer^ Venison was so plentiful 
in Limbo that the cattle were fed 
on it. Partridges and grouse were 
no delicacy; he would have been 
glad of a few shooting parties to 
reduce the numbers, the carcasses 
being shipped away to some place 
that would be glad of them, like 
Earth. 

He didn't mind being a hunter. 
He hated being a butcher. 

The Gateways were ignored. They 
had left the stairway where it was, 
although Rex had no wish to re- 
turn. 



IF 




Not all their time was spent work- 
ing. Soon they had read most of 
the books in the small library, at 
vant to life in Limbo, 
any rate the parts that were rele- 

O ne day when Regina was out 
doing the chores, including a 
visit to the herds on the south side 
of the lake, because Rex had trip- 
ped on a root and slightly sprain- 
ed his ankle, he looked again at 
the books and something clicked. 

It was not memory. It was more 
like deduction. 

They had been provided with 
everything they needed — far 
more than they needed. It did not 
make sense that what their minds 
needed was not supplied — unless, 
of course, the Gateways were the 
answer, and curiosity and boredom 
were meant to make them turn to 
exploration. 

He hadn’t even looked at Venus 
for several weeks. Now he went 
down the stairs again and gazed at 
her. Venus was as lovely as ever. 
He loved Regina and he could not 
love Venus; he didn’t believe a man 
could fall in kve with a beautiful, 
sleeping face. 

However, he wasn’t there to look 
at Venus. Instead he did something 
it had not previously occurred to 
him to do . 

He examined the cellar closely. 
The walls were plainly white- 
painted, the floor plastic. Although 
cold, it was not damp. He found 



ventilators and wondered where 
they led. Not upward, he guessed. 
There were no cold air curremts in 
the house or outside it. He found 
no sign of a door, trapdoor or hatch. 

The two empty cases seemed to 
mock him, and he returned to ex- 
amine his own. The plinth seemed 
solid. The lid opened and closed 
easily, not locking. He could see 
the locks, all the way round, ©nee 
they were closed, it would be easier 
to smash the solid oak lid than to 
force the locks. 

This made him pause for a mo- 
ment, but there was nothing to be 
gained by standing looking at the 
case. He climbed in and pulled the 
lid shut. 

At once, as he had half expected, 
the bolts shot. The base ©n which 
he lay began to sink smoothly and 
rapidly, and he sighed with relief. 
He had guessed right. 

The descent stopped without a 
jar and lights came on. Rex rolled 
out into a second, lower cellar. 

This one was colder still, scarcely 
if at all above freezing point, and 
he was already shivering from the 
chill of the upper cellar. Ignoring 
the other marvels of this vault, he 
looked around and, to his relief, 
saw an insulated suit hanging on 
a hook. He lost no time in putting 
it on. 

The vault was vast and it was im- 
mediately obvious that this was the 
heart of that artificial haven, Lim- 
bo. Being non-technical, he was im- 

31 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 




pressed by, but not particularly in- 
terested in, the machines. He ig- 
nored them. 

There were three shafts leading 
upward from three plinths, open 
for a few feet on one side. All look- 
ed the same from where he stood. 

Regina’s shaft, examined closely, 
was identical to his own. There was 
nothing even to indicate that the 
base which had raised her was still 
at the top of the shaft, while his 
had lowered him to the bottom 
again. 

But Venus’s, when he examined 
it, was not quite the same. 

W hen Regina arrived, not unex- 
pectedly, he held out another 
suit for her. ”Here,” he said, ^'put 
this on.” 

She did. ^'You crazy idiot,” she 
said as she did so. thought you 
were dead.” 

«Why?” 

”Oh, it’s another of those sensory 
blocks, I suppose, like the wall 
round Limbo. I knew you were in 
the cellar, but not what you were 
doing — except when you were 
drooling over Jezebel, of course. 
Then you . stopped. Like when 
you went through the Gateway.” 
”I’m sorry. Of course, there had 
to be a block. Otherwise you’d 
have known about the vault.” 
Apart from the machines, the 
main content of the vault was a 
vast library of microfilm, and one 
other thing. 



It was a model oi the galaxy, in 
an ovoid case. What was particular- 
ly interesting was that from some of 
the tiny specks representing systems 
(the scale was too small for mere 
planets to be represented) hairline 
wires led to the plastic case, and 
from there thicker wires ran to a 
board on the wall. 

There were six wires. 

''The Gateways,” said Regina 
flatly. There was never any enthu- 
siasm in her voice when she had 
to speak of the Gateways. 

Rex nodded. It was no mere co- 
incidence. 

He felt for controls around the 
base of the projection and found 
them. Any section of space could 
be brought up to fill the whole 
case. It was easy to find the sys- 
tem of the Sun and bring it up to 
full magnification. The device was 
a mere model, in no way a projec- 
tion of the real galaxy. But the 
model of the Solar System was so 
detailed, within the limits of the 
scale, that each tiny planet was 
instantly recognizable. 

And there was no wire to it. 

Even Regina, who Jiad deliberate- 
ly thought less about such matters 
than Rex, was surprised. 

"Section K, Department of Edu- 
cation and Science, London, Eng- 
land, Europe, Earth, Solar System, 
doesn’t want us casually dropping 
in to complain about the arrange- 
ments,” she said. 

"No,” said Rex thoughtfully. 



32 



IF 




At one corner of the model was 
a panel giving the names of sys- 
tems and planets as they were fo- 
cused. Soon Rex found BuUan, the 
ninth planet of a star called Car- 
thage, with a dty named Mer- 
cury. A wire led from Bullan, con- 
firming something that scarcely 
needed confirming. The Bullan wire 
led to a connection exactly at the 
top point of the circle on the wall 
board. 

The five others led to worlds 
called Cresta, Neri, Landfall, Chu- 
tcr and Byron. Not one was a plan- 
et of a sun with a name known to 
Rex or Regina, stars that had been 
old friends of mariners on Earth 
long before man started sailing the 
spaceways. 

*^But that doesn’t matter,” said 
Rex, going back to the microfilm 
shelves and setting up a viewer. 

'^wenty minutes later he frowned 
up at Regina, who had been si- 
lently watching him. ''Not a word 
about any of them,” he said 
thoughtfully. "Everywhere else, 
yes.” 

"We’re meant to make up our 
minds at first hand, then.” 

He managed not to laugh. Taken 
unawares, she had admitted what 
she had obstinately refused to ad- 
mit. But he said nothing. Instead, 
he went back to the model and 
turned the knobs apparently aim- 
lessly. 

Regina started to move about. 



"I don’t have a built-in crystal 
ball,” she said. knew the moment 
you were back from Bullan. But 
the moment before that — noth- 
ing. I was lying awake in bed. No 
presentiment. Suddenly you were 
back. That was all. Nevertheless, 
I’ve got a presentiment about this. 
Go on as you’re doing, and some- 
thing fearful is going to happen. I 
know it.” 

"You could be right. But don’t 
you see, it doesn’t make any dif- 
ference? People do what they have 
to do.” 

She whirled away impatiently. 
Then abruptly she came to a stop 
at the foot of Venus’s shaft. "What 
is this?” she said. 

Rex came and stood beside her. 
"I saw that,” he said quietly. 

Unlike the other two, this shaft 
had a large, ostentatious switch on 
the plinth. 

"What do you want to do about 
that?” said Regina, going to a lot 
of trouble to be casual. 

He shrugged and said nothing. 
Indeed, he walked away, leaving 
Regina by the shaft. 

"Are you just going to leave it 
like that?” she demanded. 

"Leave what like what?” 

"Well, I won’t.” she said delib- 
erately threw the switch at the 
base of Venus’s shaft. 

"Why did you do that?” Rex 
asked mildly. 

"It had to be done.” 

"Did it?” 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



33 




She shrugged and didn^t answer. 

'^You mean,* he suggested, ”it’s 
like having to climb mountains be- 
cause they^re there?” 

^Terhaps.” 

She ignored that. 

They looked at the shaft, and 
waited a couple of minutes. Noth- 
ing happened. 

VIII 

^^hat night, scanning the micro- 
^ film as Regina sat at a table 
altering clothes which she had de- 
cided she didn’t like, Rex found a 
recurring theme, one which puzzled 
him. 

Just why was Earth still so im- 
portant? 

The emotional ties he could un- 
der stand. On Earth and on Earth 
idone, a human race, the human 
race, had evolved. Yet with the emo- 
tional ties unbroken. Earth could 
still have become the Old Country, 
half despised, half reluctantly loved. 

Somehow it hadn’t happened like 
that. 

Earth ran everything. Every col- 
ony was always turning to Earth. 
That was why there had never been 
major conflict among the human 
settlements. Nobody risked being 
cut off from Earth. 

What’s Earth to you, Regina?” 
he asked. 

Absently, busy with her work, 
she said: ''Home. The mother 
world. That’s aU.” 



And you want to go back there 
some day?” 

"Some day.” She looked up, 
more alert. "Don’t try to talk me 
into anything, Rex. Limbo is fine. 
Earth’s a noisy overpopulated, 
screaming madhouse like nearly ev- 
erywhere else. The last thing I want 
is to go back and live there. All 
I’m say is, everybody wants to 
see the old place again, sometime.” 
He passed that, although appar- 
ently he was not included in ev- 
erybody. 

The next day, Rex’s ankle being 
much better, they both went to 
check on the herds on the south 
side of the lake. Regina had not 
reached them the day before. 

In the middle of a severely prac- 
tical discussion on killing or cas- 
trating yoimg bulls, preferably kill- 
ing if they could get the carcasses 
back to the house, Regina observ- 
ed: 

"She’s out now.” 

"Venus. What’s she doing?” 
Regina shrugged. "I haven’t the 
faintest idea.” 

"Why did you do it, Regina?” 
She knew what he meant. I’d 
never build a house halfway up a 
volcano or labor anxiously in a val- 
ley threatened by an avalanche that 
had to come sooner or later. I like 
to know where I stand. If something 
has to happen sooner or later, I’d 
rather it was sooner.” 

"Do we go back now? I’m asking 
because this seems to be yoiu: idea.” 

IF 



34 




'^No. We carry on as intended.” 

It was late afternoon when they 
returned to the lake, making their 
way round the shoreline because it 
was mostly flat and easy going. 

”We^re privileged, or about to 
be,” Regina said. '*You especially, 
being a man.” 

*^What are you talking about?” 

”An historic occasion. A wonder- 
ful spectacle. You’re about to be 
present as Venus Rises from the 
Waves.” 

Rex still looked blank. 

They rounded the small ridge. 
And there, emerging from the lake 
to meet them, was Venus. 

S he was naked and she was as 
magnificent as Regina had fear- 
ed. It would have been, even Re- 
gina admitted, ludicrous for such a 
being to emerge from the wayes 
vulgarized by a bathing costume. 
It would have been like putting 
clothes on cats and dogs. 

Seeing them without surprise, 
Venus pulled herself strongly up 
the three-foot bank, twisting lithely 
to get her feet under her and stand 
up all in one fluid movement. Mere 
water could not make her long dark 
hair limp. Breathing deeply, begin- 
ning already to steam as water was 
still running off her pale flesh, she 
was less a goddess than woman in- 
carnate, making Regina feel sud- 
denly very young, small, frail and 
helpless. It was not that Venus was 
old —she might have been twenty- 



two or twenty-six, but no more. 

'^You must be Rex and Regina,” 
said Venus. 

We must,” Regina agreed. ”Nice 
to see you. An)nvay, Rex thinks so. 
You must forgive a certain lack of 
enthusiasm in me.” 

Venus laughed and spontaneously 
caught one of Rex’s hands and one 
of Regina’s, clasping them together 
in both of hers. ^'No suspicion, Re- 
gina,” she said in her warm, slight- 
ly husky voice. "From the start, 
no suspicion, no jealously, no awk- 
wardness between us. In the way 
you’re concerned about, I’ll stay in 
my place. In others — ” 

"What places are you not going 
to stay in?” Regina asked, since 
Venus did not continue and Rex, 
smiling as he looked thoughtfully 
into Venus’s eyes, did not seem in- 
clined to say anything at all. 

Venus smiled too. "Oh, that just 
slipped out. I meant for instance, 
if Rex . No, that really must 
wait. We’ve just met.” 

Rex was thinking: She knows 
more than Regina or I knew in our 
first hours awake in Limbo. Per- 
haps she already knows more than 
we do now. 

On the way back to the house, 
Rex asked Venus to go on ahead. 
When she had gone, he took Regina 
gently by the shoulders and said, 
"You precipitated this, remember?” 
"It’s all my fault, then. Obvious- 
ly.” 

"I didn’t say that. If it’s any- 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



35 




body’s fault, it’s the fault of who- 
ever decided Venus should be here 
with us. That’s certainly a puz- 
zle — ” 

"No, it isn’t,” said Regina cold- 
ly. "The reason is quite obvious.” 
"It’s not obvious to me.” - 
"With her here, we’ve got to in- 
vestigate the Gateways.” 

He had exp)ected something quite 
different. "Huh?” he said blankly, 
completely at a loss. 

"Don’t you see? You and I were 
a imit. Now she’s here, suddeply we 
have conflict. It’s inevitable. It is 
not your fault or mine or even 
hers. It’s in the situation. Her prom- 
ise, if it was a promise, is neither 
here nor there. Three of us in Lim- 
bo .. that means we have to look 
outside.” 

"I see what you mean,” he said 
slowly. "But why did you throw 
that switch?” 

"I told you at the time.” 

She had told him, he decided 
more than enough for the moment. 
He kissed her to tdl her something 
important: that she was Regina 
and Venus was just Venus. 

IX 

V enus couldn’t have been less 
trouble to them. She acted like 
a self-effacing mother-in-law, though 
nothing looking less like any moth- 
er-in-law could have been imagined. 
If Rex and Regina seemed to want 
to be alone at night, Venus went 



to her room with a book or a ndcro- 
film. If Regina was otherwise en- 
gaged — but only then — Venus 
would cook meals almost equal to 
Regina’s. If there was work to bo 
done, Venus was glad rather than 
willing to do it; time seemed to 
hang a little heavy on her hands, 
though she was far more patient 
than either Rex or Regina. 

Rex never gave Regina a mo- 
ment’s anxiety. Neither did Venus. 
But. They all knew that Ve- 
nus’s presence meant Limbo was 
overflowing, too full of company or 
not full enough. 

Ironically, the second Gateway 
expedition was made by Rex and 
Regina. 

At the foot of the stairway to the 
second Gateway, they turned to 
Venus awkwardly. 

"See you in seventeen days or 
so,” she said cheerfully. 

It was at that moment that Re- 
gina remembered one unanswered 
question, and it suddenly seemed 
important. 

"Venus,” she said, "when we 
first met you, you said that in 
one way you’d stay in your place, 
but in others. ... You promised 
to tell us later what you meant.” 

Venus smiled. 

"I didn’t promise to tell you,” 
she said, "but I will. Here, Rex is 
supposed to be the boss. I’ve never 
disputed it, have I? But if I thought 
Rex shouldn’t be the boss, and I 
should, I’d do something about it.”

There was no menace in her 
voice. Rex knew, however, that she 
meant it. It even seemed logical, 
tmderstandable, that, the patient 
Venus should turn out to be the 
supervisor of the Limbo plan, what- 
ever that was. 

Regina, two steps up, started to 
come down. She seemed to think 
there was something to discuss, to 
argue about. 

Rex caught Regina by the waist 
and gently started her up the 
stairway again. 

see,” he said. '^So long, Ve- 
nus.” 

''Good luck.” 

Rex and Regina climbed the 
stairs, waved to Venus, and simul- 
taneously touched the Gateway. 

I t was worse than the arrival at 
Bullan^s city of Mercury, worse 
even than the awakening in Limbo. 

It was hot, blindingly hot, sear- 
ingly hot. Rex’s overalls were al- 
ready soaked with sweat, steaming 
in the heat. Regina lay beside him, 
pale and limp and unconscious, 
and although he ached to help 
her, he could do nothing for her, 
yet. Around them was blinding yel- 
low desert — nothing else. Rex 
looked around for some indication 
where he should go and found none. 
The needle of the compass he had 
brought was spinning aimlessly. 

He reached over to stroke Re- 
gina’s cheeks, her hair. She was 
breathing, but as if in a deep trance. 



This time they had brought with 
them three things — a compass, a 
water-bottle and a knife. All could 
be thrown away if they didn’t need 
them. The compass had already 
proved useless. The knife might or 
might not be valuable. The water- 
bottle was worth its weight in 
gold. 

Rex took his first sip from the 
bottle. The water, he found with 
relief, was the main restorative. 
Now his headache was easing and 
he was able to face the ordeal of 
standing up. 

Regina could not be left, as she 
had been left in Limbo, to revive 
in her own time. He sat up, and 
she groaned without opening her 
eyes. For a minute or two he see- 
sawed her up and down. 

Then she opened her eyes. "Let 
me die,” she said. 

"Don’t think like that.” 

"You’re very bright and spry,” 
she said resentfully. "Have you 
been awake for hoiurs?” 

"Only a few minutes.” The or- 
deal was far worse for her than for 
him. She was, of course, a slim, 
tiny creature, with only a small 
reserve of strength. 

Regina pulled herself together 
with an effort, sniffed the air and 
looked around. "It’s all right,” she 
said without enthusiasm. "I know 
where we are. Stay here for a mo- 
ment.” 

She staggered about twenty yards 
and turned round two or three 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



37 




times, her eyes shut. Then, her eyes 
still closed, she returned and stop- 
ped only inches short of where the 
Gateway must be. 

She opened her eyes. ”We don’t 
need to mark the spot,” she said. 
^T’ll be able to come right back to 
it. That’s north.” She pointed. 
'^There’s a city almost due east of 
here, about four miles.” 

A city four miles away in a 
world where compasses didn’t work 
would have been hard to find with- 
out Regina’s special sense. 

^^Can you sense the whole world?” 
Rex asked. 

^'Only very vaguely.” 

^^You can sense people, can’t 
you?” 

'^Gnly that there are people. Men 
and women, not aliens. But 1 can’t 
tell you whether they’re black, red 
or green, dwarfs or giants, friends 
or enemies.” 

'^he dty was not large; Regina 
couldn’t give a more accurate 
estimate than that. There was no 
other city within fifty miles. The 
population of the planet was small, 
she thought, and mainly on the 
equator. 

Their overalls were not unsuitable 
for the environment, but they should 
have had sunhelmets. Rex took off 
the timic of his overalls, took off 
the shirt he was wearing under- 
neath, and put the tunic back, on. 
He ripped the shirt in two to make 
turbans to protect their heads. 



When he turned, he saw Regina 
flat on her face on the binning 
sand, motionless. 

He dropped beside her. She was 
scarcely breathing. He felt her 
pulse and found it rapid and, 
frighteningly irregular. 

A thought grew from nothing un- 
til it filled his whole mind. Regina 
was dead against exploring the 
Gateways, whether he did it alone 
or they went together. She had nev- 
er exactly agreed to accompany 
him; her attitude was rather that if 
it was impossible to stop him going, 
she would go with him. 

Regina had a special gift. It was 
not telepathy, and she could not 
foresee the future. Yet she had had 
a presentiment. Wasn’t it possible 
that she knew that for her the 
Gateways were deadly? 

When at last she opened her eyes, 
he said: We’re going straight 

back.” 

She smiled with something of the 
old sarcastic twist. '^You could. I 
can’t. Do you think I could take 
that again so soon and live?” 

She began to laugh weakly, half 
l}dng, half sitting. With the slight 
exertion her flesh began to steam 
again and droplets welled from her 
to run over her body and fall on the 
sand. 'Tt’s funny,” she said. 

There’s nothing I want more than 
to get back to Limbo. But I can’t 
go. I’ll have to help you to explore 
this hellspot. If I don’t make my- 
self get up and move and burn out

this sickness, I’ll never see Limbo 
again.” 

X 

"O egina, who had been leading the 
way in a dead straight line, 
at last turned almost due south. 
”Over that ridge,” she said, nod- 
ding at it, ”is the city. If we skirt 
the ridge we’ll be about level with 
the city as we enter. Appearing 
on the skyline we might be too 
conspicious.” 

Rex nodded. 

A few seconds later they saw 
the city. It consisted of squat con- 
crete buildings, wide avenues and 
grassy parkland not unlike a North 
African city except that there was 
no Arab influence in the architec- 
ture. The cars that speeded about 
were ordinary ground cars, and 
though the pedestrians they could 
see were too far distant for any de- 
tails to be made out, they seemed 
to be ordinary humans. 

They waited until a few people 
had passed close enough for them 
to make out what they were like. 
Inspection of the Crestans satisfied 
them that Rex’s overalls and Re- 
gina’s tunic and skirt, their height, 
color and general appearance would 
pass without comment in the city. 
Their improvised turbans, however, 
would not. The Crestans didn’t wear 
sunhelmets. 

Rex and Regina took off their 
turbans and buried them in the 



sand. Then they stepped forward 
boldly. 

More than most cities, this one 
began abruptly at a set point, in- 
stead of straggling out into the 

country, semi-urban, semi-rural. 
The presence of the desert explain- 
ed that. 

Soon Rex and Regina were in 
quite a busy quarter. Although 

they were not ignored, as Rex had 
been in Mercury, anyone who stared 
stared at Regina, and that was 

merely her natural right. 

These people were busier, more 
alert, more purposeful than the 

people of Mercury. Everyone ap- 
peared to have somewhere to go, 
and all were in a hurry to get there. 

When they found a church open 
they went inside. It was clear at 
once that churches here, like every- 
thing else, were very different from 
those of Bullan. Here were no re- 
minders that Doomsday was near. 
This church was small, very mod- 
ern, cool and empty. There was no 
equivalent of the archway in the 
Mercurian church, and this was not 
merely because this chiurch was not 
Catholic. The Crestans were too 
busy always to be running to the 
priest for what help he could give 
them. 

After walking in Strand 7 for an 
hour, they felt they were getting 
nowhere. 

On the face of it, they had learn- 
ed a great deal. Cresta was a recent- 
ly developed world, not rich as 



SIX GATES TO UMBO 



39 




planets went but not poor cither, 
specializing in delicate workman- 
ship because the natural resources 
of the planet were negligible. 

A valuable find was a thfck 
newspaper left on a park bench. 
Strand 7 was not big enough to 
have a newspaper of its own. The 
Cresta Times served the whole 
world and at that it was not daily 
but weekly. 

Since no one else was sitting on 
a public bench reading a newspaper, 
they scanned it quickly and then 
carefully folded it to put in their 
pockets. But now, from tag-ends of 
conversation, a notice or two and 
what they had gleaned from the 
paper, plus some guesswork, they 
knew one of the main Crestan prob- 
lems, the one on which the future 
of the settlement depended, and 
the main hope of a solution — a 
plan to stock the seas with fish. 

T>efore colonization, Cresta had 
had no life whatever; such soil 
as there was had to be worked on 
for a long time before it would 
grow anything useful. The grass 
they had seen was artificial. Cresta 
had no soil to waste on mere deco- 
rative grass. 

For years the seas had been 
stocked with live fish, algae, plank- 
ton and all the organic refuse 
Cresta could spare from the eternal 
fight to make another acre of soil 
productive. The basic snag was that 
any creature brought alive to the 



planet could live only on something 
else brought to the planet. 

Cresta took ever 3 rthing other 
worlds didn^t want — sewage, any 
non-poisonous effluent, vegetation 
in any condition, all the refuse of 
other, live planets. To get all this 
for nothing beyond freight cost, 
which was considerable, Cresta 
couldn’t afford to be choosy. The 
plan, or rather the pious hope, was 
that all life or near-life being dump- 
ed into the seas and on sterile soil 
would eventually rearrange itself 
into a balanced pattern. 

And all this refuse was brought 
to Cresta by ships. There was no 
mention of any Gateway. 

Little Limbo could actually 
breathe life into Cresta, possibly 
enough to make it a real, living 
world. Thousands of birds and an- 
imals, hundreds of tons of vegeta- 
tion could be pushed through the 
looking glass. ... 

Of course, Cresta would want 
too much, would fight for it, and 
Limbo would die, like many anoth- 
er golden goose. 

They had learned a lot, but 
they had made none of the fleet- 
ing contacts Rex had made with 
the people of Mercury, the brief 
glimpses into their lives which had 
told him almost everything of any 
importance that he discovered there. 

At last Regina said: 'Tf we’re go- 
ing to find out anything here with- 
out money, we’ll have to make 
something happen.”

‘‘Do you have any ideas?” 
^'You’re the one who’s supposed 
to have ideas. You managed to 
find out quite a bit about Mercury. 
Why not here?” 

''You sit on that bench,” he said. 
"If anything happens to me, don’t 
get involved.” 

"What are you going to do?” 
He moved away from her without 
answering, because he didn’t know. 

Then he remembered the immi- 
gration office they had seen in the 
next street. Without a glance back 
at Regina, he went to it, walked in 
and said to the clerk at the desk: 
"I want to go back.” 

The clerk, a thin girl with pale 
eyebrows, smiled thinly and said: 
"You know you can’t.” 

"I want to go back, I tell you.” 
"Back where?” 

"Earth.” 

T?or a moment she was too as- 
-*■ tonished to laugh. Then she 
laughed. 

"You came direct?” she asked. 
Something told me not to say 
yes. He didn’t want to say no ei- 
ther, because he couldn’t answer 
the next question. 

"What does that matter?” he 
retorted, trying to act belligerent 
and not very smart, so that any- 
thing he didn’t know could be put 
down to general ignorance. 

"You know perfectly well,” she 
said, as if to a child, "that if you 
left Earth voluntarily, you under- 



took never to return except on vis- 
its, the first not less than thirty 
years ahead. If you didn’t leave 
Earth voluntarily, you don’t get 
back, ever.” 

Half the time you don’t know 
what you’re signing,” he grumbled. 

She shook her head. "You must 
have known, if you really came 
from Earth. How can I help you?” 

"If you can’t get me back you 
can’t help me.” 

"Short of that, how can I help 
you?” 

"I’m out of a job.” 

This time he’d really said the 
wrong thing. 

"Who are you?” she asked. 

He was in trouble. 

"Look,” he said desperately, "I’d 
say or do anything to get off this 
planet. Any ideas?” 

"What do you know about the 
birds?” she asked carefully. 

He knew it was a trick question. 
It was like asking a man who claim- 
ed to come from Mercury if the 
street lighting was still good. He 
couldn’t guess the answer. He had 
to know it. 

"What birds?” he said, and was 
not in the least surprised when her 
eyes showed instantly this was one 
of the many wrong answers. 

She reached for a button m the 
desk. He didn’t know who she 
was stunmoning, but he was quite 
sure it would be someone — or 
something — he didn’t like.

There was a year missing from 
the calendar. Only the X-men 
knew where it went — and why.

A boy needs to identify himself 
with someone, I guess. Or, any- 
how, something. 

TTiere has to be a model. Usual- 
ly a parent. Maybe Ma first, than 
Pa later. I suppose it comes natur- 
ally to those who have parents. I 
didn’t, not after I was three years 
old, so I had to cast around. 



There was no anchorage in Gran. 
She had lost her own bearings soon 
after finding her son and daughter- 
in-law shot dead at the river’s brink. 
She had taken me for a walk. To- 
gether, hand in hand, we came up- 
on them. 

Ma lay on her back, head and 
shoulders submerged. Her face was 
a pallid blob which seemed to be 
actively grimacing. But it was only 



43 




the effect of the brown water flow- 
ing over and around it. 

My father was sprawled on top 
of her, arms about her, head on her 
bosom. We wore a blue and yellow 
checkered shirt, with a red pear- 
shaped patch between his shoulder 
blades. From the stalk end of the 
pear, redness trickled very slowly, 
making a thread down the dirt 
bank. The thread’s end was frayed 
by the streaming river. 

Years later, I was able to form 
a guess about it. Someone with a 
gun had trapped them, backs to the 
river. Maybe trying to evade a shot, 
my mother had fallen. My father 
had shielded her with his body 
and caught the next shot in his 
back. He died holding her, and his 
weight forced her down the bank- 
side. She drowned. 

I never heard that anyone tried 
all that hard to catch the murderer. 
Anyhow, no one was caught. 

I grew up with Gran but most 
©f the time she made no sense. Her 
mind had gone to pieces. Little she 
said led anywhere. Our highest 
flights of conversation concerned 
the weather. It was hot or cold, dry 
©r wet. She paid small attention to 
what I said and usually contra- 
dicted what she herself said. She 
confused me. I couldn’t ape her be- 
havior; there was no pattern 'to it. 

If I had other living relatives, 

I never heard tell of them. 

My neck of the woods was thinly 
inhabited. None of the inhabitants 



cared a cent about me. It was so 
unanimous that I reckoned I was 
unlikable. I couldn’t think why, for 
I was eager To please. Yet I was 
always odd-boy-out at school, as if 
I were trying to be different by 
being an orphan. 

I wasn’t popular with the teach- 
er, either. I found it tough to follow 
the drift of his mind. The others 
seemed able to keep in touch with 
it. I floundered behind and was 
punished for it. 

If I protested, the answer was 
the same in flavor and content. 
“You want reasons, Cabot? Right. 
One, you’re incurably stupid. Two, 
you’re lazy. Three, you ask too 
many silly questions. Why don’t 
you just remember what I tell you, 
as the other boys do? That way you 
might complete a halfway decent 
exam paper.” 

T preferred animals to people. Yet 

they had shortcomings, too. I 
mean, there was nothing noble. 
about them. I used to think maybe 
a lone wolf was noble. But I never 
saw one — I think it was only 
book-stuff. When the snows drove 
the wolves down out of the moun- 
tain woods, they went around in 
packs attacking the weaker crea- 
tures. Just like schoolboys. 

I think my father must have been 
noble. 

The giant oak was noble. They 
called it that — giant. Maybe it 
would have been a giant among 

IF 




other oaks but here there were no 
other oaks. It stood on top of a 
hill. The pines rooted on the slopes 
seemed nothing beside it. It had 
lived and suffered and grown twist- 
ed and gnarled.*The pines were just 
a lot of skinny telegraph posts. 
They hadn^t any character. They 
y^ere only striplings. 

The oak was older than they 
^ere in every way. 

The metal plate on the stake 
nearby said; This oak was planted 
from an acorn on August 15th 
1945 to commemorate the victory 
of the Allied Forces, 

That was after the Second World 
War, of course. 

I used to think a lot about the 
past because the present was dismal 
and portended no change for the 
future. The past seemed to become 
real when I sat and dreamed under 
the widespread arms of the .oak. 
It was my childish fancy that they 
were antennae picking up faint 
pulses from a world that had been 
hereabouts but drifted away. 

I was fool enough to mention 
this to the Sheriff’s son. 

He looked at me strangely. “You 
ain’t right in the head, Bart.” 

Thereafter I kept my fancies to 
myself. 

Another attraction of the oak was 
its being the only vantage point 
from which you could see a mite 
over the next ridge, into the valley 
of the X-men. The X-men — ap- 
parently so-called because they 
THE YEAR DOT 



were an unknown quantity — fasd* 
nated me. There seemed to be very 
few of them — I’d never glimpsed 
more than two of them at the 
same time. They rarely left the 
valley, either on foot or by space- 
ship. 

You’d never meet one to speak 
to. Since Bobbie was knocked out, 
no one wished to. 

Bobbie was a trigger-happy 
goon who killed more creatures 
than he could cat, because it made 
him feel good. One day he saw 
something move in the undergrowth 
and shot at it from force of habit. 
It was an X-man who shot right 
back at him with some kind of ray- 
gun. Bobbie was unconscious for 
two days. 

The Sheriff posted an order: 
Everyone keep clear of the valley 
of the X-men. 

You couldn’t enter the valley, 
anyhow. There was an invisible 
fence around it. I ran into it once. 
It was like coming up against a 
headwind which became stronger 
at every step. It forced me to a 
standstill. But there was no wind, 
only an elastic force-field which 
stretched but wouldn’t break. 

Obviously the X-men were in- 
terested in us only to the extent of 
making us keep ©ur distance. 

A Taybe once, and never more 
than twice a year one of their 
spaceships would drift earthward, 
humming like a great bee, and 

AS 




settle in the valley. Almost always 
its visit was short. Within a couple 
of 4ayS; it would be off again into 
the infinite. 

Where did the X-men come from? 
Where did they go to? And why 
was no one except myself interested 
enough to wonder? 

There was a sizable library in 
Yorktown. Each time I was in town, 
I would search for information 
about them — in vain. 

The librarian was middle-aged, 
fat and stupid. Her face was like 
the hack of a shovel — convex and 
blank. She cared so little for books 
that she often set them on the 
shelves upside down. She was no 
help. 

‘‘The X-men? No, I don’t recol- 
lect seeing an 3 dhing about them. I 
reckon nobody knows anything 
about them, anyway. So who could 
write a book?” 

“But surely there must be some- 
thing about them in the newspapers 
or the magazines?” 

“There are the files. Look for 
yourself, son.” 

I looked. And looked and looked 
during repeated visits. One day I 
discovered something I wasn’t look- 
ing for: the Year Dot. Logically, 
it should have been the year 1978 
A.D. but, illogically, it didn’t exist. 

I first noticed the hiatus in the 
massed pulp of the Yorktown 
Weekly Advertiser. Each complete 
year of issues was tape-strung be- 
tween two wooden slats. I’d been 
46 



leafing back through the last cou- 
ple of decades, yawning over the 
same old fines imposed on the same 
old drunks, and the same old dis- 
putes about drains and boundaries. 

During such a yawn, I reached 
down the next file. As the files 
were in chronological order, it 
should have been labeled 1978. But 
it was in fact 1977. I completed 
the yarn without surprise. The fat 
lady was a slipshod filer. 

Then I went hunting for the 
missing year 1978. Eventually I 
was among the yellow and gray 
pages of almost half a century ago, 
half afraid to turn them because 
they were brittle and tore easily. 

By then I’d had about enough 
and was tempted to forget it. But 
the librarian was oozing past, so I 
tapped her elbow. 

“Pardon me, but do you know 
where Year 1978 of the Advertiser 
has gotten to?” 

She looked at me vaguely, then 
over my shoulder at the desk. 

“Why, you’ve got it right there 
in front of you.” 

“What? No, look, this one’s 
1977.” 

She looked again, and frowned. 
“Don’t waste my time, son. It’s 
not April Fool’s Day.” 

She jellied on. 

T>emused, I checked the fifty-two 
copies in the file. They were 
all 1977. I sucked my thumb, 
which sometimes gives me an idea. 

IF 




It did now, though nothing brilli- 
ant. I went and surveyed the ranks 
of various yearbooks. Some sets 
didn^t go back far enough but the 
ones that did shared a characteris- 
tic: there was no edition for the 
year 1978. 

With a respect I didn’t feel but 
thought wise to assume to avoid 
being ejected,- 1 asked the librarian 
to come and look. 

‘‘Look at what?” she asked ir- 
ritably, but came. 

I ran my finger along the spines 
of the Medical Yearbook, 

“1977, you see, and then 1979. 
But no 1978.” 

She said, “Look, boy, IVe had 
enough of this. Settle down quietly 
or else get out.” 

She was dead serious. But then, 
so was I. 

“I’m sorry, I’m not trying to 
make trouble. Guess I can’t see 
straight today. Would you point 
out the 1978 volume?” 

She looked at me suspiciously, 
hesitated, then touched the Year- 
book for 1977. 

“Oh, I see,” I said, guilelessly. 
“And that’s 1976 to the left of 
it?” 

Half watching me, half watching 
what she did, she jerked her finger 
back along the line of books. “1976, 
’75, ’74, ’73, ’72 . and so on. 
It’s plain as plain. You’d better 
see an oculist son; you need glass- 
es.” 

I rubbed an eye and then peer-

ed with an assumption of sq^opia. 

“And the other way — 1979 on?” 
I asked. 

She sighed, and fing^-jabbed 
again. “1979, ’80, ’81, ’82, ’83 . 

This time her prononacementa 
and the dates on the spines coin- 
cided — I couldn’t have agreed 
more. Whereas, working back, she 
named the year before each edition, 
a year out of kilter all the way. And 
I couldn’t prove she was wrong. 
No use to subtract the first date 
(1945) from the last (199S) and 
then count the books to skew that 
there was one short. For she would 
see 1945 as 1944, a conq^nsating 
error. None so blind, et cetera. 

“Thanks,” I said quietly. “I’ll go 
see that oculist.” 

“Wait — let me see your reader’s 
ticket.” 

I gave it to her. She glanced at 
it and asked, “Why didn’t you re- 
new this last year, when it expir- 
ed?” 

I peeped at it. It was in date. 
Somehow, she was seeing last year’s 
date. What a way to run a library, 
I thought. There was no future — 
or past — in arguing the point. I 
bent with the gale. 

“Guess I forgot. Sorry.” 

“I’ll renew it,” she said, and did 
so at her desk. She passed me the 
new ticket. I watched for her to 
tear up the old one — the usual 
procedure. She didn’t. She put it in 
a drawer. 

I began the long walk home, 

47 




wondering about that — and the 
rest of it. 

II 

W as it my business to report 
that the librarian had slipped 
a cog in her brain? Maybe 
the Council knew that and bore 
with it, together with her slovenly 
methods. Why was 1978 so pain- 
ful to her that it had to be exor- 
cised from her memory and even 
from her library? She wore no wed- 
ding ring. Was that the year of her 
final rejection, sentencing her to 
spinsterhood — and a trauma? 

Back at the shack which I called 
home, I asked, with little hope of 
a sensible answer, ‘‘Do you remem- 
ber the year 1978, Gran?” 

For once there was a responsive 
flicker in her eyes of much diluted 
blue. Her lips twitched in the be- 
ginning of a smile which never 
made it. 

“Sure I remember. I remember 
’em all — right back to the Year 
Dot.” 

The Year Dot was a term she 
often used. I took it to niean the 
Year Zero, the year God created 
the world. 

“Anything special happen in 
1978?” 

“The Year Dot,” she said, and 
the smile came, and it was a grim 
and strange one. ^^That happened. 
That was the Year Dot, Bart.” 

“I don’t understand.” 



‘“It was a cold winter, that year. 
Terrible cold. Everything froze. 
Everybody froze to the bone like 
they was all bone. Except for the 
wolves. And they came down and 
ate everybody up. Bones and all. 
Thousands of ’em.” 

“Thousands of wolves?” 

“Thousands,” she said, her eyes 
emptying again. She chewed her 
gums and plucked at non-existent 
loose threads on her lap. She made 
mumbling noises, then said, almost 
brightly, “It’s turning cold again. 
Colder than yesterday.” 

Subject normal — and safe. I 
could get no more out of her about 
the Year Dot. 

There was no one else in this 
district I would confide in. But 
there were other towns than York- 
town and other libraries. All far 
away, but I would start saving for 
fares. 

I saved nothing, for Gran died a 
few days later from hardened ar- 
teries. The funeral swallowed my 
small capital and more. I had to 
sell most of our old furniture to 
cover the bill. 

She’d provided, of late, so little 
company that I told myself I’d 
hardly miss her. I missed her like 
hell. She was the only person I 
didn’t regard as a stranger, my 
only blood relation. 

The last link with my parents 
had broken, and I learned what 
real loneliness meant. 

The day after the funeral I was 

IF 



48 




wedged in the topmost crotch of 
the giant oak, as far above this sad 
world as I could get, brooding over 
what I could glimpse of the valley 
of the X-men. It wasn’t much. The 
trees, the scrub, the stony ground 
looked much the same as in my 
own valley. The fference lay in 
their inaccessibility and the danger 
that dwelt there. 

/^nce already this morning I’d 
seen an X-man walking slow- 
ly — they never seemed to hurry — 
across the far slope. Distance made 
him tiny, but X-men, I knew, were 
taller than us — at least a foot 
taller. He wore a long gray coat 
and a black hood or helmet, that 
might have been of fur. He was 
very erect; his carriage conveyed 
dignity. I couldn’t distinguish 
enough of his face to form a pic- 
ture of it. But my imagination fur- 
nished a noble brow, imperious 
nose, and wise, kind eyes. The kind 
off ace maybe my father had. 

Nobility was suggested by the 
stately way they walked. It was a 
quality lacking in my world. I guess 
I was aware of it from history 
books about Washington and Lin- 
coln and story books about King 
Arthur. 

“Cabot!” 

A harsh bellow came from my 
ignoble world down there under 
the waves of curiously and endear- 
ingly shaped oak leaves. 

“Cabot, come down here!” 

THE YEAR DOT 



It was the Sheriff, He-Who- 
Must-Be-Obeyed. Reluctantly hat 
sensibly, I duly obeyed. That toa|^ 
screen of branches mightn’t step 
all of the buckshot from reachiaag 
me. The Sheriff was Bobbie’s op- 
posite. Bobbie’s rule of thumb was: 
if it moves, shoot it The Sherill^s 
rule was: if it doesnH move whra 
ordered to, shoot it. 

“Coming,” I called, to forestal 
perforation, and abandoned itij 
eyrie. 

Instead of looking down, I be- 
came the one looked down on. The 
Sheriff was almost as tall as an X- 
man, not a bit noble, and had 
difficulty in controlling sudden ani- 
mal rages. 

He glowered at me. “You’re a 
great reader, mn’t you, Cabol?” 
“Yes, I do read a lot. Sheriff.” 
“Then why the hell idn’t yen 
read my notice? It said to keep 
away from that valley.” 

“I never go any nearer to it than 
this.” 

“And that’s too damn near. Be 
you want to get shot?” 

“Bo you mean by you — er 
the X-men?” 

Animal rage won for the moment. 
His backhander sent me crashing 
against the knobbly trunk. 

“Don’t sass me. What was yon 
doing up there?” 

“Only looking. Sheriff.” 

“See any X-men?” 

“Yes. One.” 

“Then make no mistake, he saw 

A9 




you. They carry guns, you know. 
They don’t like to be spied on. 
They’ll pick you off that tree like 
you was a crow.” 

“m watch it, Sheriff.” 

“Watch nothing. Just stay away 
from this ridge. Stay home and 
read your books. What kind of 
books you read? History books?” 

TTis eyes, close-set as a chimpan- 
^ zee’s, were conning me with 
unusual intensity. As he was all but 
illiterate, I wondered at his sudden 
interest in my literary tastes. 
“Sometimes.” 

“What you tr5dng to learn.” 
“What it used to be like in the 
old days, I guess.” 

“What old days?” 

What lay behind this cross-exami- 
nation? W^y had the Sheriff come 
looking for me, anyhow? Books, 
libraries — memory connected them 
and I made a guess. I experimented 
with the guess. 

“The nineteen-seventies mostly.” 
His eyes narrowed until they al- 
most disappeared. Yes, the con- 
nection was sound. The librarian 
had held my old reader’s ticket 
because it bore my name and ad- 
dress. She had phoned the Sheriff 
about me. He was checking how 
much I knew about the Year Dot. 
Obviously, I wasn’t supposed to 
know anything. From here on, I 
should have to watch my step. 

“What’s so interesting about 
them, Cabot?” 

50 



I shrugged* “I was born around 
the end of that decade. It’s just 
natural curiosity about what the 
world was like when I came into 
it.” 

“Mooning about what’s past and 
gone won’t earn you no bread. And 
you ain’t got all that much in the 
larder now, have you? You’d do 
better to think about making a liv- 
ing instead.” 

“Guess you’re right. Sheriff.” 

“I ought to jail you for breaking 
the law — you know that? But 
seeing you’re only young, I’m gon- 
na parole you instead. You report 
to my office twice a day, except 
Sundays, at eleven and four, sharp, 
until further orders. Got that?” 

“Yes, Sheriff.” 

“Then get this too. Don’t ever 
come up this area again. Keep 
away from this tree. Stay in the 
valley. That’s a final order. Break 
it and I’ll break you — in pieces. 
There won’t be no second chance. 
Now get out of here.” 

I slouched in a defeated sort of 
way down to our valley. There was 
every cause to feel defeated. Unless 
you had a car or horse — I had 
neither — you had to walk to York- 
town which was a three-hour tramp, 
either way. Those reporting times 
were designed to prevent me from 
visiting the Yorktown library dur- 
ing its open hours. 

But I didn’t feel all that cast 
down. I realized I’d happened upon 
something important. Discovering 

IF 




just what was a challenge that of- 
fered excitement and some danger. 

Just as well, maybe, that I didn^t 
realize then the degree of danger. 

I paused once to glance back up 
the slope. The Sheriff was stand- 
ing, hands on hips, looking judidal- 
ly up at the oak tree as though he’d 
been asked to estimate its height. 

Ill 

'l^ext morning I went to the 
Sheriff’s office to report, and 
he was out. His Deputy was in. I 
tried to report to him. 

“You can’t do that,” he said. 
“Sheriff said you gotta report to 
him personal. You just wait till he 
gets back.” 

I waited for three and a half 
hours, becoming angry and then un- 
easy. If it went on like this, I’d 
never be able to earn enough to eat. 
Maybe that was the idea . 

The Sheriff arrived in a station 
wagon. He dropped a couple of pas- 
sengers — the Evans brothers, 
woodsmen. They went on down the 
street, taking a cross-cut saw with 
them. 

The Sheriff came on in, ducking 
under the lintel. He looked at me 
and smiled, surprisingly. It was the 
sort of cruel anticipatory smile peo- 
ple have when they know someone 
they don’t like is due for a nasty 
shock. 

“Okay, Cabot — blow. But be 
back at four o’clock.” 



It was two-thirty and hardly 
worth trudging home to turn around 
and come back. But I had hung 
about long enough and had a lot 
of bottled frustration to work off. 
I strode out, silent but furious. I 
heard the Sheriff whisper something 
to his Deputy, and the latter’s 
cackling ‘“Haw-haw-haw” followed 
me along the passage. 

It was one of those times when 
I suddenly hated the human race. 

The quiet, deserted woods were 
a haven and soothed my rage. As I 
walked through them, I fell 
to thinking about the Year Dot. 
It stood to reason that there could 
be no missing year. Time didn’t 
stop and start like a clock. At mid- 
night, December 31st, 1977 Earth 
began another circuit of the sun 
and the period of twelve months 
it took to complete it was 1978. 
Calling it 1979 changed nothing 
basically. 

Therefore, this current year of 
grace, 1996, was in fact 1995. 

My mind began circling instead 
of tackling the problem. It needed 
figuring out at leisure; I would 
postpone it till the cool of the 
evening, 

I reached my shack and glanced 
at my watch. I could spend a whole 
fifteen minutes at home before 
starting back. I went on a little 
way along the valley to a spot 
where I could see the forbidden 
hill. 

The hill was still there. The gi- 

51 



THE YEAR DOT 




ant oak wasn’t. I could see blue 
sky through the gap where it 
wasn’t. 

That pang of dismay is sharp 
in my memory yet. It was as bad 
as that time I looked into Gran’s 
room and saw at once that she was 
dead. 

I didn’t give another thought to 
the Off-Limits order. I ran up 
there, reached the crest with a 
thumping heart and no breath. 

The oak was still there, after 
all, but in two parts. Its great 
roots incongruously supported a 
stump only two feet high. The 
upper bulk, fallen, lay just over 
the crest, sprawling down the steep 
slope. I looked down at it, sobbing 
for breath, and then over its foliage 
at the ridge of the valley of the 
X-men. 

Like a sentinel, an X-man stood 
on that ridge. He seemed to be 
gazing straight at me. 

Qhocked and hurt, I jumped to a 
^ conclusion. The X-men had done 
this to stop me from peeping into 
their valley. Possibly they’d used 
some kind of long-range cutting 
ray. 

I shook my fist at the distant 
figure and gasped vain threats of 
retaliation. 

Then I sat down on the stump, 
hid my face in my hands and cried 
like a lost child — which in effect 
I was. That oak had been to me 
the one solid, reassuring thing 
52 



in a bewildering and untrustworthy 
world. Its roots were my roots, its 
existence confirmation of my own 
existence. I had scaled it so often 
that my hands and feet knew the 
shape of every bough, the relative 
positions of all vantage points for 
the ascent. More than once, for 
amusement, I’d climbed it with my 
eyes shut. 

And now my hands, although I 
was still aware of the conditioned 
impulses in them, would never again 
reach for those rough branches. 

When I pulled myself together 
and stood up, the X-man was still 
there, as motionless as any of the 
valley pines. Then I discovered I’d 
done him an injustice. From the 
evidence of the sawdust and teeth- 
marks, the oak had been cut down 
by human hands. Those of the 
Evans brothers, doubtless, by order 
of the Sheriff. Now I understood 
his smile. 

For the first time, I felt a sense- 
less urge to kill a man. 

I looked at the raw, sap-bleeding 
stump. Long though the tree had 
stood, as oaks go it had been slain 
in the prime of life, at the age of 
fifty years, if my theory that it was 
now 1995 were correct. Should I 
ever be able to verify it? 

The concentric circles of the an- 
nular rings suggested a monster eye 
staring up into space. I stood there 
like an oaf too dumb to read the 
message in it: This is the record 
of my years. 



IF 




Newton and Archimedes were 
quicker off the mark than I, but 
I got the message presently and 
with equal excitement. 

I counted the rings carefully 
thrice and thrice agreed with my- 
self. The oak was fifty-one years 
old, and therefore the present year 
was 1996, just as they said it was. 
My theory was incorrect. 

And this meant that one year 
had been snipped clean out of his- 
tory, leaving no record — at least, 
not in Yorktown. The Year Dot: 
1978. 

They may have destroyed all the 
yearbooks for that year and deleted 
it from the calendars. They may 
have maintained by a trick of 
numeration that there never was 
such a year. But they couldn’t 
buck Nature’s calendar. 

I sat there awhile, brooding 
about who was trying to fool 
whom and why. Maybe they had 
been fooled into believing there was 
no 1978. Maybe a hypnotic blind 
spot had been planted in their 
minds. By whom? The X-men? If 
so, why? 

I looked across to see if the X- 
man were still there. He was. 

I stood up on the small plateau 
of the stump and studied him for a 
couple of minutes. He was as thin 
as a scarecrow and could have been 
one for all the movement he made. 
In fact, I began to wonder if it 
were a dummy planted there to 
THE YEAR DOT 



act, so to speak, as a scare-human. 

Behind me, the Sheriff’s voice 
said, “Wasted my breath warning 
you, didn’t I?” 

I froze, heart sinking, then slow- 
ly turned. He was only a couple of 
yards away and look^ tensed up. 
He hadn’t brought his shotgun, but 
there was a revolver in his holster 
and his arm was crooked as if 
halfway to the draw. 

“Figured I couldn’t trust you, 
Cabot. That’s why I follered you. 
I been watching you counting them 
rings. Smart, ain’t you? But I out- 
smarted you.” 

I realized then that he at least 
knew the books had been cooked, 
and wasn’t fooled any about the 
Year Dot. 

I tried to look cool and sound 
steady. “You outsmarted yourself, 
too. Sheriff. When you cut down 
this tree you revealed the true 
calendar.” 

“Get down from there,” he growl- 
ed. “Come here. This time you go 
to jail.” 

I saw from his eyes that he 
meant it — and more. I would be 
clapped in a cell and never emerge 
from it in this life. 

“I’m coming,” I said, quietly, to 
mislead him — and suddenly leaped 
from the stump, away from him, 
over the crest, down into the lower 
branches of the fallen giant. 

There was tangled undergrowth 
all around. The trunk formed a 
bridge over it. The maze of branch- 

53 




es was no obstacle to me; I knew 
every foot of the route through it. 
The Sheriff didn’t. He took a blind 
shot from the crest at me; the 
leaves hid me and the thick limbs 
shielded me. 

Then he plunged after me. I’d 
almost OTear that the oak did its 
best to block and hinder him. He 
kept getting hooked up on its 
branches. 

By the time he broke free, I had 
said goodbye to the oak and reach- 
ed the bottom of this valley. 

Which way now? To the right, 
the valley became a cul-de-sac, a 
potential trap. To the left, it 
emerged on a bare prairie where 
there was no place to hide. Either 
way, capture or death was inevit- 
able. 

Ahead of me the ground sloped 
up to the spot where the X-man 
stood like an unconcerned specta- 
tor. He was an unknown quantity. 
The Sheriff was a known quantity. 

I hesitated. 

Thud. A bullet hit the earth a 
yard behind me. 

I opted for the unkown and 
scrambled up towards it. 

T heard the revolver fire again and 
^ lead swish past my ear. Sweat 
ran onto my eyebrows, and it wasn’t 
all caused by exertion. 

Wildly I looked for cover but 
the undergrowth was thin on this 
side of the valley. I scrambled on- 
ward towards the X-man. All at 



once he came , to life and pointed 
an arm in my direction. Something 
in his hand glowed deep red for an 
instant. 

I flung myself on my chest. But 
I wasn’t the target I heard a tnm- 
cated cry behind me, and peered 
back and down. Near the valley 
bottom, the Sheriff lay on his back, 
arms and legs spread stiffly apart, 
forming an X. 

Would it be my turn next? 

I looked up. The X-man was 
statuesque again. I was close 
enough now to see his eyes. They 
were watching me. Calmly. Sanely. 
There was none of the anger, scorn 
or stupidity so common in human 
eyes. 

But the rest of him was repellent. 

His long military-style coat was 
unfastened and hung apart, reveal- 
ing a figure emaciated and seem- 
ingly deformed. Where had I got- 
ten that impression of physical 
grace and dignity? His limbs were 
double-jointed though not in the 
usual sense. They were hinged into 
three moveable sections; each arm 
had two elbow joints, each leg two 
knee joints. 

That grotesque arrangement 
bothered me less than the evidences 
of disease. His neck glands were 
swollen lumps, one practically a 
goiter. His bloodless face was pur- 
ple-scarred with the craters of old 
pustules. His large-knuckled fingers 
looked arthritic. His fur helmet was 
skull-tight. 



54 



IF 




Nevertheless, he had kept his 
pride. 

He held himself erect. His 
mouth was firm yet sensitive. 

I got to my feet, watching him 
all the time. 

He spoke. His voice carried to 
me through the still air like a 
sweet-toned faraway campanile bell. 
His English was only slightly ac- 
cented. 

“You may go. I shall not harm 
you.” 

“There’s nowhere for me to go.” 

“I wouldn’t say that. Suppose 
you come and discuss it with me, 
Bartholomew Cabot?” 

I didn’t ask him how he knew 
my name. Just then, reasons were 
less important than feelings. For 
the first time I could remember, I 
had been made to feel welcome. I 
went to him without another 
thought. 

He fingered a small control box 
on his belt. I gaess he dissolved 
the invisible fence temporarily, for 
I reached him with no trouble. He 
towered over me, misshapen, horrib- 
ly marred, a nightmare creature. 
And friendly warmth radiated from 
him. 

I felt no fear. 

“Call me Lon,” he said. “It’s near 
enough.” 

He led me into his valley, walk- 
ing in a deliberate, stately fashion. 
It was his way of combatting 
Earth’s stronger gravitation with- 
out losing poise. 

THE YEAR DOT 



IV 

L on had shown me over the huge 
ship repair bay deep in the 
valley. It was cybernetics-plus. The 
atomic reactor plant drilled for ore, 
extracted its fuel, and governed its 
output with severe self-discipline. 
The gantries moved their mass 
around at the touch of a finger. 
Robots bristling with powered tools 
awaited the word of command. 

Lon issued the commands. It was 
all he had to do. 

He was quite alone in that long, 
dog-leg valley. He saw another X- 
man but once or twice a year, 
when a ship stopped by for repair 
or refueling. They were mostly one- 
man ships, fully automatic. 

“We’re nomads now, and there 
aren’t all that many of us. We’re 
the remnants of a once great and 
flourishing people, who thought 
they were the masters of their fu- 
ture, HubriSf Bart. Nobody’s om- 
niscient — there are just too many 
imponderables in the universe. The 
computers only knew what we told 
them, and we didn’t tell them about 
the Lykas because we didn’t know 
about the Lykas.” 

We were in the spacious open- 
plan room where Lon spent most 
of his time. There was the living 
area with the long sofas to rest 
those long legs. A section of the 
wall here was hung with paintings 
of exotic flowers 'and beasts; the 
luminous paint made them glow 

55 




with life. There was the kitchen 
corner. Then came the operational 
area with the consoles and the wall 
panels where colored pin-points 
crawled like insects over numbered 
configurations. There was a whole 
battery of TV screens. Some screens 
which were dark now would light 
only to reveal intruders at the boun- 
dary fence. 

Lon became abstracted. 

“I don’t know about the Lykas, 
either,” I prompted. 

He looked at me. ‘^You do and 
you don’t.” Then he smiled at 
my plain confusion. “Visual illustra- 
tion,” he said, and reached long 
arms to a control panel. 

He indicated one of the screens. 
It framed an aerial view of my 
own valley. He had told me of the 
many tiny eyes, no larger than 
mustard seeds, seemingly wind- 
borne for miles around but actual- 
ly components of a planned scan- 
ning network. They were micro- 
engineered cameras of infinite com- 
plexity. 

'^his particular Eye moved up 
^ the valley, though the gap 
where the oak had stood, swooped 
down the far slope and hovered so 
low over the still unconscious 
Sheriff that his face filled the 
screen. Then it swept into the dark 
cavern of his left nostril. The screen 
was black only for a moment. Then 
the Eye became a penetration ray 
camera looking into the brain, turn- 
56 



ing its arteries into glass, its con- 
volutions into shadows, with the 
sutured cranium a background to 
it all. 

Thick among the brain cells, in- 
festing the bloodstream, were a 
m3n:iad of moving black points, like 
iron filings. 

“The Lykas: a microbe race,” 
said Lon. “Their intelligence was 
always limited by their size, but 
in human blood they’ve become 
even duller than they were; it’s 
not a very stimulating environ- 
ment.” 

“They’ve made the Sheriff sick 
in his mind?” 

“Well, sicker, shall we say? 
Frankly, much of the human race 
was pretty sick before they affect- 
ed it.” 

An abominable thought struck 
me. “Are the Lykas in my brain?” 

“No, Bart. I’ve checked the 
whole local population. Even gone 
into their personal and medical his- 
tories as far as I could. You’re 
the only one that’s clean. You 
have a rare blood-group which 
doesn’t suit the Lykas at all. Even 
if I hadn’t check^, I should have 
known that you weren’t infected. 
You came to me. You weren’t 
afraid. But the Lykas are afraid 
— afraid I might discover they’re 
here and exterminate them.” 

“So they think you’ve not dis- 
covered them yet?” I asked, feel- 
ing a lot easier. 

Lou smiled. “They’ve degenerat- 

IF 




ed to the point where they can 
harffly think at all now. Their rea- 
soning is infantile. They’re behaving 
like a child which shuts its eyes 
and reasons that because it can’t 
see you, therefore you can’t see 
it.” 

“How long have they been here? 
How did they get here?” 

“They came by way of my planet 
long, long ago. But they didn’t 
reach Earth until the year which 
should have been numbered — ” 
“Nineteen seventy-eight I” I ex- 
claimed. “The Year Dot, I call 
it.” 

“Which they pretend was non- 
existent. You see how childish 
they’ve become.” 

“Tell me all about them, Lon.” 
It was a story which ended with 
a question, and I had to answer 
that question. Lon gave me time 
to think it over. I used much of 
the time going back over his story. 

'^he Phelenic Empire was the 
^ wonder of its corner of the 
Galaxy. Proud, learned, aspiring, 
it acknowledged neither master nor 
equal. The handsome and vigorous 
Phelenes lived life to the full in 
every direction: exploration and ad- 
venture, art and sport, research 
and philosophy. They were happily 
aware that sex, too, offered oppor- 
tunities in all these directions. 

They were benignant to their sub- 
ject races so long as there was no 
protest. But at the mere hint of 
58 



rebellion or suggestion of self-gov- 
ernment, the offending race was 
crushed by force and new laws 
and its spirit broken. 

The Phelenes were the rulers 
and intended to stay so. 

But the Lykas came without re- 
spect for their intentions. They 
were a nomadic tribe, but not from 
choice; they were seeking their 
Promised Land. Microscopic, almost 
without mass, they let light pres- 
sure carry them iJirough the void 
to new worlds and new hopes of 
roots — roots in creatures immea- 
surably larger than themselves, 
whose bodies would become both 
larders and instruments of power. 

They had little luck. Sooner or 
later, the organisms they tried to 
take over rejected them. It was so 
with the Phelenes. Unsuspected, the 
Lykas entered the bloodstream of 
the master race and strove to over- 
come the automatic bodily defenses. 

It was a war without victory. 
True, the Lykas were ousted even- 
tually. But the price was the de- 
struction of the Phelenic Empire 
and more gradually of the Phelenic 
race itself. The Phelenes’ glandular 
systems had collapsed into anarchy 
under the strain. The race lost pro- 
tection against disease — and also 
the power to reproduce. 

The Phelenes died off, save for a 
small percentage which were tem- 
pered in the fire and became resis- 
tant even to the natural process of 
aging. But they remained sterile. 

IF 




Toppled from their throne of 
power^ humiliated in the sight of 
their subject races, denied growth 
and an expanding future, the sur- 
vivors vowed to hunt down and 
cleanse the Galaxy of the Lykas. 

“We claimed to be plague exter- 
minators,” Lon had said. “Then 
that seemed too prosaic. A master 
race should be more than scaven- 
gers. Remember, our pride needed 
restoring. So we elevated ourselves 
to the Saviors of the Galaxy. We 
were selflessly trying to save others 
from sharing our fate. Obviously, 
therefore, we were instruments of 
the Holy Spirit, Crusaders for the 
Right. Many of us are still rampag- 
ing on like that through the won- 
dering worlds and maybe still im- 
press the impressionable. But some, 
like myself, realized it was only a 
cloak covering the desire for venge- 
ance. We were ever a spoiled race. 
We never really gave a damn for 
anyone but our own kind.” 

It was Lon, alone, who caught 
up with the Lykas at last. It was 
his duty then to rally the pack and 
be in at the death. 

But by then’ vengefulness had 
left him. He felt he needed time 
to consider the situation on Earth 
and reconsider the conception of 
duty. 

The Lykas, aware they were 
hunted, sought obscurity. Although 
seated in the brains of Earthlings, 
they tried to maintain an illusion 
that the human race had not been 
THE YEAR DOT 



infected. They hoped the Phelenes 
would pass them by, undetected. 

T^he battle to gain control of the 
Earthlings lasted a full year. 
Then they tried, naively, to ob- 
literate all human records and 
memories of that year, so that the 
Phelenes wouldnT notice any traces. 
But a small minority of Earthlings 
had escaped infection. If and when 
they identfied them, the Lykas 
usually arranged either to confine 
or kill them. Pretty certainly, I 
judged, my parents were such vic- 
tims. Maybe I was spared at the 
time becaause I was too young to 
know anything, and Gran because 
she had lost her mind, anyway. 

“Frankly,” Lon told me, “^the 
average level of human intelligence 
had been declining steadily for some 
time before the Lykas reached 
Earth. They came only to fall on 
stony ground yet again. This time, 
I think, for the last time. Earth- 
lings and the Lykas are bad for 
each other. A process of mutual 
mental degeneration has set in. I 
doubt if the Lykas have enough 
wit left to pull out now. That solves 
my dilemma.” 

“What dilemma?” I asked. 

“There’s no way of destroying the 
Lykas without destroying the 
Earthlings also; they’re com- 
mingled. The only workable method 
is mass extermination. And the few 
who arc immune, like yourself, are 
so scattered that it would be im- 

59 




possible to isolate them; they would 
share the general fate.” 

“I don’t see the solution,” I * 
said. 

“Time will provide it without 
Kiy intervention. The Lykas are 
on the way out. Whether the hu- 
man race survives them is not my 
problem — at least, not a prob- 
lem that I can do anything about 
at this time. Things will have to 
take their course. I’m glad not to be 
involved in killing. I’ve traveled 
much in this far-from-hospitable 
Galaxy, and my sympathy goes out 
to any form of life trying to cling 
to a foot-hold in it. I find an in- 
creasing number of my fellow 
Rielenes, as they call in here, be- 
ginning to share that outlook. Ex- 
perience teaches tolerance. The 
hunt is, losing its impetus even be- 
fore it knows the quarry has been 
found.” 

“But the Lykas caused it in the 
first place, by attacking you.” 

Lon smiled wrily. “Bart, you 
must broaden your education- too. 
You must go out there and see 
some of the things I have seen. 
The Lykas didn’t attack us from 
malice but from necessity. In fact, 
they’re less blameworthy than we. 
It was we who went spreading 
hatred among the stars. And we 
shall pass into extinction as surely 
as they. Our life-span was enor- 
mously increased, yet we remain 
mortal — and sterile. What I have 
left of life — which is still far more 

60 



than you have left, Bart — I 
plan to spend well. Exploring, learn- 
ing, and wherever possible doing 
all I can to keep Life, in the broad- 
er sense, going. It has a thousand 
enemies, and ignorance and hatred 
are only two of them. What could 
be more rewarding? I can hardly 
wait to get started. I shall be 
leaving Earth soon, Bart. Come 
with me — and learn. There’s no 
future for you on this planet but 
that of a hunted outcast. Will you 
come?” 

I considered. 

“Shall we ever return to Earth?” 
“It’s a remote possibility. No 
more than that.” 

“I must think it over, Lon.” 
“Of course.” 

L on turned his attention to the 
screens. The Eyes covering the 
settlement were depicting the Depu- 
ty’s departure in search of the 
Sheriff. He would find him sooner 
or later, but in any case could 
learn nothing from him about my- 
self for another two days. That 
was the minimum period of re- 
covery from brain-stunning. 

I thought about this world and 
it millions of alien hybrids like 
that, all against me. 

I thought about the endless won- 
ders and beauties of faraway worlds 
which I should never see unless I 
went with Lon — and the wisdom 
I might attain if I did. 

I thought about the other out- 

IF 




casts like myself here on Earth, but 
jfho were denied my chance of es- 
cape. They were as bewildered, iso- 
lated and unhappy as I had been 
— and they would never know the 
reason why . unless I enlightened 
them. 

I made my decision. 

“I’m staying, Lon. On Earth, I 
mean, but not in this locality. I’ll 
clear out tonight and head south. 
I have two days start on them, at 
least. Maybe much more. The 
Sheriff may assume I’m still here 
in the valley with you. He can’t be 
sure I’m not. And when you go, he 
may think I’ve gone with you.” 
Lou studied me, warmly, sagely. 
“What’s the point, Bart?” 

“I want to link up with my 
own kind. We’ll get organized and 
fight them off. We stand a chance 
of survival — we aren’t degenerat- 
ing, you know, whereas they are. 
We’ll cling to our foot-hold, as you 
call it. Survival’s our immediate 
aim. If we succeed, we may learn 
wisdom later.” 

Lon smiled. 



“It’s the answer I expected, real- 
ly. But there’s a bit more to it 
than that, isn’t here, Bart? At 
your age, you feel another call.” 
Yes, I felt it in my heart and 
in my loins. Spirit and body were 
uniting in crying for a mate. It 
was a call which could be answered 
only on my own planet. 

Lon didn’t need my confirmation. 
He went on, “Maybe I should envy 
you. However, sterility has its com- 
pensations: peace of mind, detach- 
ment, the contemplative life. The 
gulf between youth and maturity 
is so wide . Yes, we must go our 
separate ways, Bart.” 

“I lost my father when I was 
too young to realize it,” I said. 
“And now I feel as if realizatioii 
has caught up with me. I’ll always 
miss you, Lon. But I have to go.” 
That night I left the valley of 
the X-men and journeyed unda: 
the stars I shoiild never reach, 
southbound for the hot lands. I 
was alone again but very deter- 
mined that I would not remain so.

IF ... and WHEN 

by LESTER DEL REY 

The Staff and Stuff of Life 



big shuttle from the Moon 
‘ settled onto the landing grid 
at Denver Spaceport, and the air- 
lock began to open. As the ramp 
touched the good rich soil of Earth, 
Joe Lunik was already running 
down it. His eyes were glued firmly 
to the sign of the nearest restau- 
rant, and he headed for it in a mad 
dash. After a year eating the hydro- 
ponic junk fed the Lunar colony, he 
couldn’t wait for real food — hon- 
est, sail-grown baked potato and 
apple pie with the unmistakable fla- 
vor only Earth could provide. 

Sound familiar? It’s a scene used 
often enough in science fiction, and 
one I’ve been guilty of writing my- 
self. But it’s probably totally wrong, 
if the future follows the present 
trends. It’s part of the great body 
of m3d:hs we’ve come to accept 
about what we grow and what we 
eat, and there’s no sign that these 
m5dJis are any less entrenched now 
than ever. 



The chief of these myths is the 
claim that American agriculture 
can keep producing more and bet- 
ter food in an almost unending 
progress; and once the world learns 
to use our methods, there’ll be no 
need to worry about feeding twice 
the world’s present population bet- 
ter than ever before in the history 
of mankind. And after that, we’ll 
take our know-how out to the 
oceans, where we can probably feed 
a population of at least ten times 
what we now support. 

Like many myths, there are ele- 
ments of truth and historical fact 
behind this one. Without any ques- 
tion, the land today is producing 
at least four times as much food as 
it could have grown in Revolution- 
ary times. It is doing so with only 
a tiny segment of our labor force, as 
compared to earlier times when 
over helf of our population had to 
work the soil to feed this country 
alone. And we’ve been exporting 



62 




grain to the starving countries on 
other continents. 

Furthermore, with heavy use of 
fertilizers and modern machinery, 
we can produce much more. We can 
also turn land that was once deemed 
useless into reasonably fertile soil 
where more food can be grown. 

But the emphasis in the above 
truths lies on pure quantity and on 
what may be very short-term views. 
It’s something like the statement 
that a man who takes enough am- 
phetamines can produce twice or 
four times as much work; it’s 
enough, but it overlooks the fact 
that in a short time he may be 
producing no work at all, because 
he’ll be dead or in the hospital 
from the destruction of his constitu- 
tion. 

'^he theory of fertilizers is that 
they may replace what is taken 
from the soil by the growing plants. 
That is scientific enough an idea. 
But it just isn’t so. 

The types of fertilizers in use 
today are made up of only a few 
elements, however complicated their 
formulation may be. They are in- 
tended to replace the nitrogen, 
phosphorus and potassium. With 
those, they usually contain some 
sulfur — because the sulfates are 
handy chemicals to hook up the 
other substances — and often cal- 
cium, which may also be added in 
lime to keep the soil from be- 
coming too acid. 

IF . AND WHEN 



That makes a total of five ba- 
sic elements. The plants can sup- 
ply their own carbon, hydrogen and 
oxygen from the water and air. 
So we have eight elements, out of 
the more-than-ninety to be foimd 
in a table of the elements. 

Without these eight, the plants 
simply won’t grow. With them, veg- 
etation seems to do well. Hence, 
by sheer economic necessity, the 
fertilizers are designed to supply 
the missing ingredients only. 

Yet we know already that plants 
contain a far greater number of 
the elements than eight. And we 
know that some of the con^imds 
formed are both incredibly complex 
and necessary for the animals that 
live off the plants. 

Grapes that grow within a few 
yards of each other and receive 
identical care can vary tremendous- 
ly in the wine they produce. A 
slight difference in the soil can 
make one grape produce a dull 
wine and the other 5deld a vintage 
that will be pure delight. The diem- 
ists have identified an incredible 
number of substances in wine, but 
so far they have not been able 
to spot the exact tiny differences 
in the two ferments. One gets some- 
thing from the soil that the ether 
lacks — and beyond that, we don’t 
know what happens. 

Iron is needed for the plant chlor- 
ophyl and the red blood cells of 
the human who eats the plant. Mag- 
nesium, manganese, iodine, and sev- 



63 




eral other elements are needed in 
tiny amounts. Without these, the 
plants don’t da well. But many 
other elements in 'Hrace” amounts 
— often less than one part per mil- 
lion — influence the flavor of veg- 
etables, and some may have effects 
on human health not yet recognized. 

These are not being replaced by 
chemical fertilizers. Some are suf- 
ficiently present in most soils and 
so little used that it may not mat- 
ter for millennia — as magnesium. 
Others, like iodine, are already de- 
ficient in most soils. 

Organic farming — the use ex- 
clusively of animal and plant wastes 
in place of chemicals — isn’t a sat- 
isfactory answer today, either. It 
was a fine solution when most of 
the produce was consumed locally 
and hence supplied practically the 
same amount of waste to be re- 
turned to the soil. But today far 
greater amounts of food are grown 
per acre and shipped beyond the 
local area. Large amounts of agri- 
cultural produce are also used com- 
mercially, where little can be sal- 
vaged to be returned, but is dumped 
into the sewers to flow away for- 
ever. 

Little by little, we are leeching 
out these trace elements from the 
land. And obviously, the more we 
grow per acre, the faster we exhaust 
this vital resource. 

Tn the short-range outlook, it may 
not seem to matter. The plants 



still thrive and will continue to do 
so. 

Part of the reason is that plants 
are versatile. They can substitute 
one element for another fairly well. 
As an example, in some areas there 
is a deficiency of sulfur, and the 
wild plants use selenium in its place. 
The result is sometimes rather poi- 
sonous to animals, and the taste 
is vile; but the plant goes on. 

Modern agricultural experts have 
also been extremely good at de- 
veloping new varieties of food 
plants. Our hybrid com, for in- 
stance, produces a profusion of 
giant, uniform ears that would have 
shocked any farmer of the last 
century. 

These plant geniuses have al- 
ready begun to develop strains that 
do well on soils previously consid- 
ered impossible for sound agricul- 
ture. And we’ll unquestionably go 
on with that technical answer to 
the problems of the soil. It’s appar- 
ently a lot easier to develop a new 
breed of plant that doesn’t need 
some trace element than to go look- 
ing for whatever it is that is miss- 
ing in some slight degree. It rnight 
turn out to be indium, needed by 
the plant in one part per billion, 
and not probably of any use in 
human nutrition — according to 
what little we now know on that 
aspect of the trace elements. 

Anyhow, it sometimes takes forty 
or fifty years before men begin to 
show evidence of some kind of mal- 



64 



IF 




nutrition from the absence of an 
dement. A man usually doesn’t de- 
vdop serious atherosclerosis until 
lie is in his later years. If it turns 
out that traces of vanadium in his 
diet might have prevented that, it’s 
a little late to go back and stop us- 
ing the plants that do very well on 
soil laddng in vanadium. 

Maybe it’s just tradition that 
accounts for the way gourmets 
come back raving about the taste 
of vegetables they get in the little 
rural restaurants of France. But the 
peasants there are growing food in 
the ancient ways and using the 
older strains of plants. Their pro- 
ductivity is low, anyhow, and a few 
gourmets shouldn’t stand in the 
way of efficiency. 

As for the Vietnamese who don’t 
like the taste of our high-yield rice 
— well, they only live on the stuff. 
They obviously are pretty poor 
farmers, so who cares what they 
think? 

AyTeantime, back at the ranch, 
some strange things may be 
going on in that good rich soil that 
has been so carefully fertilized 
with calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus 
and potassium. 

Natural compost has a tendency 
to improve the texture of the soil, 
as does the plowing under of such 
natural sources of nitrogen as clov- 
er. I grew up on a farm, and I can 
still remember th^ change in soil 
after a few years of such enrich- 



ment. It was not only richer, hut 
it had a texture that held the rain 
gently and released it to every tiny 
rootlet of the plants. 

The chemicals contain soil-con- 
ditioning additives, but the looults 
are not the same. Natural is a 
complex and living thing. It requires 
the work of a vast army of creatures 
such as anglewor^ to keep it in 
shape. These creatures live on the 
organic wastes put back iolo the 
soil, in return for which they turn 
and revitalize the soil. The chemi- 
cals offer them no food suitable 
for their use. And the eacolully 
weed-free crops give them iar less 
compost than the natural ecology. 

Without the healthy creatures of 
the soil, the ground cannot last, de- 
spite all our efforts. The waters 
leech out the surface materials and 
slowly wash away the true loam 
that was built up over thousands of 
years. Then the soil cover thins, 
and the earth is blown away. 

Even with primitive methods of 
agriculture, man has been sd»le to 
ruin the soil in large areas of the 
world. The Negev desert once 
bloomed, though it never got much 
rain. Today it is a waste. And we 
have narrowly escaped similar waste 
areas in our own plains. Apparent- 
ly, once the balance is tipped, the 
decline is rapid and irreversible. 

It might be wise to wait before 
persuading the Asian peasant to 
give up his "night soil” and old- 
fashioned plant varieties until we 



IF . AND WHEN 



65 




have had a little longer to see how 
our chemicals and hybrids work out. 
We should keep at least a few areas 
in reserve for the next effort to 
overproduce. 

Of course, there are the oceans 
to be farmed, as every reader of 
science fiction must know. But we 
have found that most of the seas 
are badly in need of fertilizer. 
Phosphorus tends to sink to the 
bottom; only at the Antarctic, 
where cold waters flow downward 
and stir up the bottom ooze, is 
the sea really fertile. The equatori- 
al areas of the oceans are able to 
support less plant life than most of 
our desert land areas.

T Tpward stares Wakim, sedng the 
^ Steel General 

'Taintly do I feel that I should 
have knowledge of him,” says 
Wakim. 

''Come nowl” says Vramin, his 
eyes and cane flashing fires green. 
"All know of the General, who 
ranges alone. Out of the pages of 
history come the thundering hoof- 
beats of his war horse Bronze. He 
flew with the Lafayette Escadrille. 
He fought in the delaying action at 
Jarama Valley. He helped to hold 
Stalingrad in the dead of winter. 
With a handful of friends, he tried 
to invade Cuba. On every battle- 
ground, he has left a portion of 
himself. He camped out in Wash- 
ington wh^n times were bad, until 
a greater general asked him to go 
away. He was beaten in Little Rock, 
had acid thrown in his face in 
Berkeley. He was put on the Attor- 
ney General’s list, because he had 
once been a member of the I.W.W. 
All the causes for which he has 
fought are now dead, but a part of 
him died also as each was born and 
carried to its fruition. He survived, 
somehow, his century, with artificial 
limbs and artificial heart and veins, 
with false teeth and a glass eye, 
with a plate in his skull and bones 
out of plastic, with pieces of wire 
and porcelain inside him — until 
finally science came to make these 
things better than those with which 



man is normally endowed. He was 
again replaced, piece by piece, until, 
in the following century, he was far 
superior to any man of fledi and 
blood. And so again he fought the 
rebel battle, being smashed over 
and over again in the wars the col- 
onies fought against the mother 
planet, and in the wars the individ- 
ual worlds fought against the Fed- 
eration. He is always on some At- 
torney General’s list, and he plays 
his banjo and he does not care, for 
he has placed himself beyond the 
law by always obe5dng its spirit 
rather than its letter. He has had 
his metal replaced with flesh on 
many occasions and been a full man 
once more — but always he heark- 
ens to some distant bugle and plays 
his banjo and follows — and ihm 
he loses his humanity again. He 
shot craps with Leon Trotsky, who 
taught him that writers are under- 
paid; he shared a boxcar with 
Woody Guthrie, who taught him his 
music and that singers are under- 
paid; he supported Fidel Castro for 
a time and learned that lawyers 
are underpaid. He is almost in- 
variably beaten and used and taken 
advantage of, and he does not care, 
for his ideals mean more to him 
than his flesh. Now, of course, the 
Prince Who Was A Thousand is an 
unpopular cause. I take it, from 
what you say, that those who 
would oppose the House of Life and 
the House of the Dead will be deem- 
ed supporters* of the Prince, who 



68 



IF 




has solicited no support — not that 
that matters. And I jdaresay you 
oppose the Prince, Wakim. I should 
also venture a guess that the Gen- 
eral mil support him, inasmuch as 
the Prince is a minority group all 
by himself. The General may be 
b^ten, but he can never be destroy- 
ed, Wakim. Here he is now. Ask him 
yourself, if you’d like.” 

The Steel General, who has dis- 
moimted, stands now before Wakim 
and Vramin like an iron statue at 
ten o’clock on a summer evening 
with no moon. 

‘T have seen your beacon, Angel 
of the Seventh Station.” 

“Alas, but that title perished with 
the Station, sir.” 

“I still recognize the rights of 
the government in exile,” says the 
General, and his voice is a tUng of 
such beauty that one could listen 
to it for years. 

“Thank you. But I fear that you 
have come too late. This one — 
this Wakim — who is a master of 
temporal fugue would, I feel, des- 
troy the Prince and thus remove 
any basis for our return. Is that 
not so, Wakim?” 

“Of course.” 

“Unless we might find a cham- 
pion,” says Vramin. 

“You need look no further,” says 
the General. “It is best you 3deld 
to me now, Wakim. I say this with 
no malice.” 

“And I reply with no malice: 
Go to hell. If every bit of you were 



to be destroyed, then I feel there 
would no longer be a Steel General 
— and there would never be again. 
I think a rebel, such as yourself 
deserves annihilation, and 1 am 
here.” 

“Many have thought so, and I 
am still waiting.” 

“Then wait no longer,” says 
Wakim, and he moves forward. 
“The time is here, and begging to 
be filled.” 

II 

T Torus has entered the Middle 
^ Worlds, and he comes to the 
world of mists that is called D’do- 
nori by its inhabitmits, meaning 
Place of Contentment. As he disem- 
barks from his chariot that has 
crossed the cold and airless night 
he hears the sounds of armed strife 
about him within the great mists 
that cover over all of D’donori. 

Sla3dng with his hands the three 
knights who fall upon him, he comes 
at length to the high walls of the 
city of Liglamenti. 

D’donori is a world which, though 
it lies within the tides of the Power, 
has never been subject to the pla- 
gues, the wars, the famines that 
limit the populations of the other 
Midworlds. This is because the in- 
habitants of D’donori take care of 
their own problems. D’donori is 
made up of numerous small city- 
states and ducal principalities whidi 
are constantly at war with one aii-

unite tliem on a pennanent basis. 

Hocw 3{^)foaches the great gates 
of Liglamenti and bangs upon them 
with fab 6st. The booming sound 
carries throughout the city and the 
gates creak upon their hinges. 

A guard hurls down a torch 
through the gloom and follows it 
with an arrow, which, of course, 
misses its mark — for Horus is 
able to know the thoughts of his 
attacker and mark the line of the 
arrow’s flight. He steps to the side 
as the arrow whizzes past him and 
he stands in the light of the torch. 

”Open your gates or I’ll unhinge 
them!” he calls out. 

^‘Who are you that walks about 
weaponless, wearing only a loin 
cloth, and would give me orders?” 
^T am Horus.” 

“I do not believe you.” 

“You have less than a minute to 
live,” says Horus, “unless you open 
these gates to me. Your death will 
be the proof that Horus does not 
lie. I will then unhinge these gates 
and enter here, walking upon you 
as I pass in search of your Lord.” 
“Wait! If truly thou be he, un- 
derstand that I am only doing my 
duty and following the orders of 
my Lord, Do not think me blasphe- 
mous if I should refuse admittance 
to any who may call himself Horus. 
How do I know but that thou art 
an enemy who would say this to de- 
ceive me?” 



“Would an enemy dare be so fool- 
ish?” 

“Mayhap. For most men are 
fools.” 

Horus shrugs and raises his fist 
once more. A vibrant musical note 
stirs then within the air, and the 
gates of Liglamenti shiver upon 
their hinges and the guard within 
his armor. 

Horus has increased in stature 
by now, to ne^r three meters. His 
breechclout is the cojor of blood. 
The torch flickers at his feet. He 
draws back his fist. 

“Wait! I will give thee entrance!” 

Horus lowers his fist, and the 
music dies. His height decreases by 
a third. 

The guard causes the portal to 
be opened, and Horus enters Lig- 
lamenti. 

C oming at length to the fog- 
shrouded palace of its ruler, the 
Lord Dilwit, Duke of Ligla, Horus 
learns that word of his arrival has 
preceded him from the walls. The 
somber, black-bearded Duke, whose 
crown has been grafted upon his 
scalp, manages as much of a smile 
as he is able; that is, the showing 
of a double row of teeth between 
tight-drawn lips. He nods slightly. 
“Thou art truly Horus?” he asks. 
“Yes.” 

“It is told that every time the 
god Horus passes this way there is 
difficulty in recognizing him.” 
“And no wonder,” says Horus. 

IP 



70 




“In all this fog it is rather miracu- 
lous that you manage to recognize 
one another.” 

Dilwit snorts his equivalent of a 
laugh. “True. Often we do not, and 
slay our own men in error. But 
each time Horus has come, the rul- 
ing Lord has provided a test. The 
last time. ...” 

“. The last time, for Lord 
Bulwah, I sent a wooden arrow in- 
to a two-foot cube of marble so that 
either end protruded from a side.” 
“Thou rememberestl” 

“Of course. I am Horus. Do you 
still have that cube?” 

“Yes. Certainly.” 

“Then take me to it now.” 

They enter the torchlit throne 
room, where the shaggy pelts of 
predators offer the eye its only di- 
version from the glittering war 
weapons upon the walls. Set atop a 
small pedestal in a recessed place 
to the left of the throne is a cube 
of gray and orange marble which 
contains an arrow. 

“There you see it,” says Dilwit. 
Horus approaches, regards the’ 
display. 

“I’ll design my own test this 
time,” says he. “I’ll fetch you back 
the arrow.” 

“It might be drawn. That 
is no — ” 

Horus raises his right fist to 
shoulder level, swings it forward 
and down, striking the stone, which 
shatters. He retrieves the arrow and 
hands it to Dilwit. 



“I am Horus,” he states again. 
Dilwit regards the arrow, the 
gravel, the chunks of marble, = ^ 
“Thou art indeed Hor^,” he 
agrees. “What may I do for thee?” 
“D’donori has always been justly 
famous for its scriers. ThoiSje pf Lig- 
lamenti have oft been exceeding 
good. Therefore, I would , consult 
with your chief scrier, as I’yp sever- 
al questions I’d have answered.” 
“This would be old Freydag,” 
says Dilwit, flicking rock dust from 
his red and green kilt. “He is indeed 
one of the great ones, but . , . .” 
“But what?” asks Horus, already 
reading Dilwit’s thought, but wait- 
ing politely, nevertheless. 

“He is. Great Horus, a mighty 
reader of entrails. But none but 
those of the human sort will serve 
him. Now, we seldom keep prison- 
ers, as this can run into some ex- 
pense. And volunteers are even 
harder to come by for things such 
as this.” 

“Could not Freyday be persuad- 
ed to make do the entrails 
of some animal, for this one oc- 
casion?” 

Horus reads again and sighs. 

“Of course. Great Horus. But he 
will not guarantee the same level of 
reception as he would with better 
components.” 

“I wonder why this should be?” 
“I cannot answer this. Most Po- 
tent Horus, being no scrier myself — 
though my mother and sister both 
had the Sight. But of all scriers, I

know scatologists to be the queer- 
est sort Take Freyday, now. He^s 
quite nearsighted^ he says, and this 
means — 

‘Tumish him with the necessary 
components and advise me when he 
is ready to entertain my questions! ” 
says Homs. 

“Yes, Puissant Horus. I will or- 
ganize a raiding party immediately, 
as I can see thou art anxious.” 

“Most anxious.” 

“. And IVe a neighbor could 
use a lesson in observing bounda- 
ries!” 

Dilwit springs upon his throne, 
and reaching upward takes down 
the long gol-horn which hangs above 
it. Three times does he place it to 
his lips and blow until his cheeks 
bulge and redden and his eyes start 
forth from beneath the pelt of his 
brows. Then does he replace the 
horn, sway, and collapse upon his 
ducal seat. 

“My chieftains will attend me 
momently,” he gasps. 

Momently, there comes the sound 
of hoofbeats, and three kilted war- 
riors, mounted upon the unicorn- 
like golindi, come riding, riding, rid- 
ing, into and about the chamber, 
staying only when Dilwit raises his 
hand and cries out, “A raid! A 
raid, my hearties! Upon Uiskeagh 
the Red. Half a dozen captives I’ll 
have of him, ere the mist lightens 
with tomorrow’s dawn!” 

“Captives, did you say. Lord?” 
calls out the one in black and tan. 



“You have heard me right.” 

“Before tomorrow’s dawn!” A 
spear is raised. 

Two more flash high. 

“Before tomorrow’s dawn!” 

“Aye!” 

And they circle the chamber and 
depart. 

'"T^he following dawn, Horus is 
awakened and conducted to the 
room where six naked men lie, hands 
and ankles bound together behind 
their backs, their bodies covered 
with gashes and welts. This cham- 
ber is small, cold, lighted by four 
torches; its one window opens up- 
on a wall of fog. Many sheets of 
that monthly journal, the Ligla 
Times, are spread upon the floor, 
covering it fully. Leaning agaiust 
the windowsill, a short, age-tonsured 
man, pink- faced, hollow-cheeked 
and squinting, sharpens several 
brief blades with a whetting bar. He 
wears a white apron and a half- 
furnished smile. His pale eyes move 
upon Horus, and he nods several 
times. 

“I understand thou hast some 
questions,” he says, pausing to gasp 
between several words. 

“You xmderstand correctly. I’ve 
three.” 

“Only three. Holy Horus? That 
means one set of entrails will doubt- 
less do for all. Surely, a god as 
wise as thyself could think of more 
questions. Since we have the neces- 
sary materials it is a shame to 

IF 



72 




waste them. It^s been so long. 

“Three, nevertheless, are all the 
questions 1 have for the entrail- 
oracle.” 

“Very well, then,” sighs Freydag. 
“In that case, we shall use his,” 
and he indicates with his blade one 
gray>bearded man whose dark eyes 
are fixed upon his own. “Boltag is 
his name.” 

“You know him?” 

“He is a distant cousin of mine. 
Also, he is the Lord Uiskeagh’s chief 
scrier. A charlatan, of course. It is 
good fortune that has finally de- 
livered him into my hands.” 

The one called Boltag spits upon 
the Times obituary section when 
this is spoken. “Thou art the fraud! 
Oh mighty misreader of innards!” 
says he. 

“Liar!” cries Freydag, scrambling 
to his side and seizing him by the 
beard. “This ends thy infamous ca- 
reer!” and he slits the other’s belly. 
Reaching in, he draws forth a hand- 
ful of entrails and spreads them 
upon the floor. Boltag cries, moans, 
Kes still. Freydag slashes along the 
bending length of the intestines, 
spreading their contents with his 
fingers. He crouches low and leans 
far forward. “Now, what be thy 
questions, son of Osiris?” he in- 
quires. 

“First,” says Homs, “where may 
I find the Prince Who Was A Thou- 
sand? Second, who is the emissary 
of Anubis? Third, where is he 
now?” 



Freydag mumbles and prods at 
the steaming stuff upon the floor. 
Boltag moans once again and stirs. 

Horus attempts to read the 
thoughts of the scrier, but th^ tum- 
ble about so that finally it is as if 
he were staring out the room’s one 
window. 

hen Freydag speaks: 

“In the Citadel of Marachek,” 
he says, “at Midworlds’ Center, 
there shalt thou meet with one who 
can take thee into the presence 
thou seekest.” 

“. Strangely,” mutters Boltag, 
gesturing with his head, “thou hast 
read that part aright. But thy fail- 
ing vision — was clouded — by 
that bit of mercenary thou hast er- 
roneously mixed — into things . .” 
With a mighty effort Boltag rolls 
nearer, gasps, “And thou — dost not 
tell — Great Horus — that he will 
meet with mighty peril — and ulti- 
mately — failure . .” 

“Silence!” cries Freydag. “I did 
not call thee in for a consultation!” 
“They are my innards! I will not 
have them misread by a poseur!” 
“The next two answers are not 
yet come clear, dear Horus,” says 
Freydag, slashing at another length 
of entrail. 

“False seer!” sobs Boltag. “Ma- 
rachek will also lead him to the 
emissary of Anubis — whose name 
is spelt out in my blood — there — 
on the editorial page! That name — 
being — Wakim!’^ 




THE STEEL GENERAL

“Ob, falser^’ cries Frqr^, slash- 
ing further. 

“Holdr’ says Homs, his hand 
falling upon the man^s shoulder. 
“Your colleague speaks truly in one 
respect, for 1 know his present name 
to be Wakim.” 

Freydag pauses, considers the edi- 
torial page. 

“Amai,” he agrees. “Even an 
amateur may suffer an occasional 
flash of insight,” 

“So it seems I am destined to 
meet with Wakim after all, if I go 
to the place called Marachek — and 
go there I must. But as to my sec- 
ond question: Beyond the name of 
Wakim, I wish to know his true 
identity. Who was he before Lord 
Anubis renamed him and sent him 
forth from the house of the Dead?” 

Freydag moves his head nearer 
the floor, stirs the stuff before him, 
hacks at another length. 

“This thing. Glorious Horus, is 
hidden from me. The oracle will not 
reveal it — ” 

“Dotard . .1” gasps Woltag. 
“It is there, so — plain — to 
see ... .” 

Norus reaches after the gutless 
seer^s dying thought, and the hack- 
les rise upon his neck as he pur- 
sues it But no fearsome name is 
framed within his mind, for the 
other has expired. 

Hems covers his eyes and shud- 
ders, as a thing so very near to the 
edge of comprehension suddenly 
fades away and is gone. 

74 



When Horus lowers his hand, 
Freydag is standing once more 
and smiling down upon his cousin’s 
corpse. 

“Mountebank 1” he says, sniffing, 
and wipes his hands upon his spron. 

A strange, small, beastly shadow 
stirs upon the wall. 

Ill 

T^iamond hooves striking the 
-*-^'ground, rising, falling again. 
Rising .... 

Wakim and the Steel General face 
one another, unmoving. 

A minute goes by, then three, 
and now the falling hooves of the 
beast called Bronze come down with 
a sound like thunder upon the fair- 
ground of Blis, for each time that 
they strike the force of their falling 
is doubled. 

It is said that a fugue battle is 
actually settled in these first racking 
moments of regard, before the ini- 
tial temporal phase is executed, in 
these moments which will be wiped 
from the face of Time by the out- 
come of the striving, never to have 
actually existed. 

The ground shakes now as Bronze 
strikes it, and blue fires come forth 
from his nostrils, burning downward 
into Blis. 

Wakim glistens with perspiration 
now; and the Steel General’s finger 
twitches, the one upon which he 
wears his humanity-ring. 

Eleven minutes pass. 



IP 




Wakim vaiiishes in a flash. 

The Steel General vanishes. 

Bronze descends again, and tents 
fall down, buildings diatter, cracks 
appear within the ground. 

Thirty seconds ago, Wakim is 
standing behind the General and 
Wakim is standing before the Gen- 
eral, and the Wakim who stands be- 
hind, who has just arrived in that 
instant, clasps his hands together 
and raises them for a mighty blow 
upon that metal helm — 

— while thirty-five seconds ago, 
the Steel General appears behind 
the Wakim of that moment of 
Time, draws back his hand and 
swings it — 

— while the Wakim of thirty 
seconds ago, seeing himself in fugue, 
delivering his two-handed blow, is 
released to vanish, which he does, 
into a time ten seconds before, 
when he prepares to emulate his fu- 
ture image observed — 

— as the General of thirty-five 
seconds before the point of attack, 
sees himself draw back his hand, 
and vanishes to a time twelve sec- 
onds previously .... 

All of these, because a foreguard 
in Time is necessary to preserve 
one’s future existence .... 

. And a rearguard, one’s 
back .... 

. While all the while, some- 
where/when/perhaps, now, Bronze 
is rearing and descending, and a 
probable city trembles upon its 
foundation. 



. And the Wakim of forty 
seconds before the point o^ Attack, 
seeing his arrival, d^arts twenty 
seconds backward — one minute of 
probable time therefore being 
blurred by the fugue battl^, ^d 
so subject to alteration. 

. The General of forty%ven 
seconds before the point of attack 
retreats fifteen to strike agmh, as 
his self of that moment observes 
him and drops back eight — 

. The Wakim of one minute 
before goes back ten seconds — 

Fugue! 

Wakim behind the Steel General, 
attacking, at minus seventy sec- 
onds sees the General behind 
Wakim, attacking, as both see him 
and his other see both. 

All four vanish, at a pace of 
eleven, fifteen, nineteen and twenty- 
five seconds. 

. And all the while, somewhere/ 
when/perhaps, Bronze rears, falls, 
and shock waves go forth. 

The point of initial encounter 
draws on, as General before Generd 
and Wakim before Wakim face and 
fugue. 

Five minutes and seven seconds 
of the future stand in abeyance as 
twelve Generals and nine Wakims 
look upon one another. 

. Five minutes and twenty- 
one seconds, as nineteen Wakims 
and fourteen Generals glare in 
frozen striking stances. 

. Eight minutes and sixteen 
seconds before the point of attack, 

73 



THE STEEl GENERAL 




one hundred twenty-three Wakims 
and one hundred thirty-one Gener- 
als assess one another and decide 
upon the moment .... 

... To attack en masse, within 
that instant of time, leaving their 
past selves to shift for themselves 
in defense — perhaps, if this instant 
be the wrong one, to fall, and so 
end this encounter, also. 

T)ut things must end somewhere. 

Depending upon the lightning 
calculations and guesses, each has 
picked this point as the best for 
purposes of determining the future 
and holding the focus. And as the 
armies of Wakims and the Generals 
clash together, the ground begins to 
rumble beneath their feet and the 
fabric of Time itself protests this 
use which has been made of its dis- 
positions. A wind begins to blow 
and things become unreal about 
them, wavering between being and 
becoming and afterbeing. And some- 
where Bronze smashes his diamonds 
into the continent and spews forth 
gouts of blue fire upon it. Corpses 
of bloodied and broken Wakims and 
fragments of shattered Generals 
drift through the twisting places be- 
yond the focus of their struggles and 
are buffeted by the winds. These 
be the dead of probability, for there 
can be no past slaying now and the 
future is being remade. The focus of 
the fugue has become this moment 
of intensity, and they clash with a 
force that sends widening ripples of 

76 



change outward through the uni- 
verse, rising, diminishing, gone by, 
as Time once more ticks history 
around events. 

Beyond their midst. Bronze des- 
cends and somewhere a city begins 
to come apart. The poet raises his 
cane, but its green fires cannot 
cancel the blue flare that Bronze 
exhales now like a fountain upon 
the world. Now there are only nine 
cities on Blis and Time is burning 
them down. Buildings, machines, 
corpses, babies, pavilions, these are 
taken by the wind from the flame, 
and they pass, wavering, by the fair- 
ground. Regard their colors. Red? 
There’s a riverbank, green stream 
hung above, and flying purple 
rocks. Yellow and gray and black 
the city beneath the three lime- 
bright bridges. Now the creamy sea 
is the sky and buzzsaw come the 
breezes. The odors of Blis are smoke 
and charred flesh. The sounds are 
screams amid the clashing of broken 
gears and the rapid-fire rainfall of 
running feet like guilt within the 
Black Daddy night that comes on 
like unconsciousness now. 

“Cease!” cries Vramin, becoming 
a blazing green giant in the midst of 
chaos. “You will lay waste the en- 
tire world if you continue!” he cries, 
and his voice comes down like thun- 
der and whistles and trumpets upon 
them. 

They continue to strive, however, 
and the magician takes his friend 
Madrak by the arm and attempts 

IF 




to open them a gateway of escape 
from Blis. 

^^Civilians are dying 1” cries a mo- 
ment of the General. 

A moment of Wakim laughs. 

“What difference does a uniform 
make in the House of the Dead?” 

A great green door appears in 
outline, grows more substantial, be- 
gins to open. 

Vramin diminishes in size. As the 
door swings wide, he and Madrak 
are both swept toward it, as tall 
waves race and topple upon a wind- 
slashed ocean. 

The armies of Wakim and the 
General are also raised by the waves 
of chaos and driven by the winds 
of change until they, too, are come 
at last to the green gateway which 
stands now wide, like a luminous 
magnet/ drain/ whirlpooPs center. 

Still striving, they flow toward it 
and one by one pass within and 
are gone. 

Bronze begins to move very slow- 
ly as the gateway closes, but some- 
how passes through it before the 
chaos comes upon the empty space 
it occupied. 

Then the roaring and the move- 
ment cease and the entire world of 
Blis seems to sigh within the mo- 
ment of its reprieve. Many things 
are broken and people dead or dy- 
ing at this moment, which could 
have been one set thirty-three sec- 
onds before Wakim and the General 
began the fugue which will not now 
begin upon the litter-strewn fair-

ground with its crevasses and Its 
steaming craters. 

Among the fallen archways, the 
toppled towers, the flattened 
buildings, salvation strides with its 
sword of fires unsheathed. The fe- 
vers of the day come forth from 
the Houses of Power, and some- 
where a dog is barking. 

IV 

'D egard now the Citadel of 
Marachek at Midworlds’ Cen- 
ter ... 

Dead. Dead. Dead. Color it dust. 

This is where the Prince Who 
Was Once A God comes often, to 
contemplate — many things. 

There are no oceans on Ma- 
rachek. There are still a few bub- 
bly springs, these smelling like wet 
dogs and being warm and brackish. 
Its sun is a very tired and tiny 
reddish star, too respectable or too 
lazy ever to have become a nova 
and passed out in a burst of glory, 
shedding a rather anemic light 
which makes for deep, bluish sha- 
dows cast by grotesque stands of 
stone upon the enormous beach of 
dun and orange that is Marachek 
beneath its winds; and the stars 
above Marachek may be seen even 
at midday, faintly, though in the 
evening they acquire the intenaty 
of neon, acetylene and flashbulb 
above the windswept plains; and 
most of Marachek is flat, though 
the plains rearrange themsdves 

77 




twice daily, when the winds achieve 
a kind of sterile climaK, heaping 
and unheaping the sands and grind- 
ing their grains finer and finer — 
so that the dust of morning and 
dusk hangs throughout the day in 
a yellowish haze, which further de- 
tracts from Marachek’s eye in the 
sky — all, ultimately, levelling and 
settling, the mountains having been 
ground down, the rocks sculpted 
and resculpted, and all buried and 
resurrected perpetually. This is the 
surface of Marachek, which of 
course was once a scene of glory, 
power, pomp and pageantry, its 
very triteness crying out for this 
conclusion; but further, there is 
one building upon Marachek at 
Midworlds’ Center which testifies 
to the saw’s authenticity, this be- 
ing the Citadel, which doubtless 
shall exist as long as the world it- 
self, though mayhap the sands shall 
cover and discover it many times 
before that day of fiinal dissolution 
or total frigidity. The Citadel — 
which is so old that none can say 
for certain that it was ever built. 
The Citadel, which may be the old- 
est city in the universe, broken and 
repaired (who knows how often?) 
upon the same foundation, over 
and over, perhaps since the imagi- 
nary beginning of the illusion called 
Time. The Citadel, which in its very 
standing testifies that some things 
do endure, no matter how poorly, 
all vicissitudes — of which Vramin 
wrote, in The Proud Fossil: 

78 



“The sweetness of decay ne’er 
touched thy portals, for destiny is 
amber and sufficient” — the Cita- 
del of Marachek-Karnak, the 
archetypal city, which is now mainly 
inhabited by little skittering things, 
generally insects and reptiles, that 
feed upon one another, one of which 
(a toad) exists at this moment of 
time beneath an overturned goblet 
upon an ancient table in Marachek’s 
highest tower (the northeastern) as 
the sickly sun raises itself from the 
dust and dusk, and the starlight 
comes down less strongly. This is 
Marachek. 

When Vramin and Madrak enter 
here, fresh through the gateway 
from Blis, they deposit their charges 
upon that ancient table, made all 
of one piece out of a substance pink 
and unnatural which Time itself 
cannot corrupt. 

This is the place where the 
ghosts of Set and the monsters he 
fights rage through the marble 
memory that is wrecked and re- 
built Marachek, the oldest city, for- 
ever. 

V ramin replaces the General’s 
left arm and right foot; he 
turns his head so that it faces for- 
ward once more, then he makes ad- 
justment upon his neck, to hold the 
head in place. 

“How fares the other?” he in- 
quires. 

Madrak lowers Wakim’s right 
eyelid and releases his wrist. 



IF 




“Shock, I’d suppose. Has anyone 
ever been torn from the center of 
a fugue battle before?” 

“To my knowledge, no. WeVe 
doubtless discovered a new syn- 
drome — ‘fugue fatigue’ or ‘tem- 
poral shock’ I’d call it. We may get 
our names into textbooks yet.” 

“What do you propose to do with 
them? Are you able to revive 
them?” 

“Most likely. But then, they’d 
start in again — and probably keep 
going till they’d wrecked this world 
also.” 

“Not much here to wreck. Per- 
haps we could sell tickets and turn 
them loose. Might net a handsome 
penny.” 

“Oh, cynical monger of indul- 
gences! ’T would take a man of the 
cloth to work a scheme like that!” 

“Not so! I learned it on Blis, if 
you recall.” 

“True — where life’s greatest 
drawing card had become the fact 
that it sometimes ends. Neverthe- 
less, in this case, I feel it might be 
wiser to cast these two upon sepa- 
rate worlds and leave them to their 
own devices.” 

“Then why did you bring them 
here to Marachek?” 

“I didn’t! They were sucked 
through the Gateway, when I open- 
ed it. I aimed for this place myself 
because the Center is always easiest 
to reach.” 

“Then suggestions are now in or- 
der as to our course of action.” 



“Let us rest here awhile, and I 
will keep these two entranced. We 
might just open us another Gateway 
and leave them.” 

“ ’Twould be against my ethics, 
brother.” 

“Speak not to me of ethics, thou 
inhuman humanist! Caterer to 
whatever life-lie man chooses! 
Th’art an holy ambulance-chaser!” 

“Nevertheless, I cannot leave a 
man to die.” 

“Very well. Hello! Someone has 
been here before us, to suffocate 
a toad!” 

Madrak turns his eye upon the 
goblet. 

“I’ve heard tales that they might 
endure the ages in tiny, airless 
crypts. How long, I wonder, has 
this one sat thus? If only it lives 
and could speak! Think of the glor- 
ies to which it might bear witness.” 

“Do not forget, Madrak, that I 
am the poet, and kindly reserve 
such conjectures to those better able 
to say them with a straight face. 
I — ” 

Vramin moves to the window, 
and, “Company,” says he. “Now 
might we leave these fellows in good 
conscience.” 

Upon the battlements, mounted 
like a statue. Bronze whinnies like 
a steam whistle and raises three 
legs and lets them fall. Now he ex- 
hales laser beams into the breaking 
day, and his rows of eyes wink on 
and o£F. 

Something is coming, though still

‘‘Shall we, then?” 

“No.” 

“I share thy sentiment.” 

Sharing, they wait.

'^Tow everyone knows that some 
machines make love, beyond 
the metaphysical writings of Saint 
Jakes the Mechophile, who posits 
man as the sexual organ of the 
machine which created him, and 
whose existence is necessary to ful- 
fill the destiny of mechanism, pro- 
ducing generation after genera- 
tion of machinekind, all the 
modes of mechanical evolution flow- 
ing through man, until such a time 
as he has served his purpose, per- 
fection has been reached, and the 
Great Castration may occur. Saint 
Jakes is, of course, an heretic. As 
has been demonstrated on oc- 
casions too numerous to cite, the 
whole machine requires a gender. 
Now that man and machine under- 
go frequent interchanges of compo- 
nents and entire systems, it is possi- 
ble for a complete being to start 
at my point in the mech-man spec- 
trum and to range the entire ga- 
mut. Man, the presumptuous organ, 
has therefore achieved his apo- 
theosis or union with the Gasket- 
head through sacrifice and redemp- 
tion, as it were. Ingenuity had 
much to do with it, but ingenuity 
80 



of course is a form of mechanical 
inspiration. One may no longer 
speak of the Great Castration, no 
longer consider separating the ma- 
chine from its creation. Man is here 
to stay, as a part of the Big Pic- 
ture. 

Everyone knows that machines 
make love. Not in the crude sense, 
of course, of those women and men 
who, for whatever economic pur- 
poses may control, lease their bodies 
for a year or two at a time to one 
of the vending companies, to be 
joined with machines, fed intra- 
venously, exercised isometrically, 
their consciousness submerged (or 
left turned on, as it would be), to 
suffer brain implants which stimu- 
late the proper movements for a 
period not to exceed fifteen minutes 
per coin, upon the couches of the 
larger pleasure clubs (and more and 
more in vogue in the best of homes, 
as well as the cheap street corner 
units) for the sport and amuse- 
ment of their fellows. No. Machines 
make love via man, but there have 
been many transferences of func- 
tion, and they generally do it spir- 
itually. 

Consider, however, a unique 
phenomenon which has just arisen: 
the Pleasure-Comp — the computer 
like an oracle, which can answer an 
enormous range of inquiries, and 
will do so, only for so long as the 
inquirer can keep it properly stimu- 
lated. How many of you have en- 
tered the programmed boudoir, to 

IF 




have enormous issues raised and 
settled, and found that time passes 
so rapidly. Predsely. Reverse-cen- 
taur-Uke — i.e., human from the 
waist down — it represents the best 
of two worlds and their fusion into 
one. There is a love story wrapped 
up in all this background, as a man 
enters the Question Room to ask 
the Dearabbey Machine of his be- 
loved and her ways. It is happening 
evoywhere, always, and there can 
often be nothing quite so tender.

XTow comes Horus, who, seeing 
Bronze on the wall, deposeth 
and saith; 

“Open this damned gate or I’ll 
kick it down!” 

To which Vramin makes reply 
over the battlement, sa3dng: 

“Since I did not fasten it, I am 
not about to undo it. Find your own 
entrance or eat dust.” 

Horus does then kick down the 
gate, at which Madrak marvels 
slightly, and he then mounts the 
winding stair to the highest tower. 
Entering the room, he eyes the 
poet and the warrior-priest with 
some malevolence, inquiring: 
“Which of you two denied me 
passage?” 

Both step forward. 

“A pair of fools! Know you that 
I am the god Horiis, fresh come 
from the House of Life!” 

“Excuse us for not being duly 
THE STEEL GENERAL 



impressed, god Horus,” says Mad-r 
rak, “but none gave us entrance 
here, save oursdves.” 

“How be you dead men named?" 
“I am Vramin, at your service, 
more or less.” 

“And I, Madrak.” 

“Ah! IVe some knowledge of 
you two. Why are you here, and 
what is that carrion on the table?” 
“We are here, sir, because we 
are not elsewhere,” says Vramin, 
“and the table contains , two men 
and a toad — all of whom, I should 
say, are your betters.” 

“Trouble can be purchased 
cheaply, though the refxmd may be 
more than you can bear,” says 
Horus. 

“What, may I inquire, brings the 
scantily clad god of vengeance to 
this scrofulous vicinity?” — • Vram- 
in. 

“Why, vengeance, of course. Has 
either of you vagabonds set eyes 
upon the ftince Who Was A Thou- 
sand recently?” 

“This I must deny, in good 
faith.” 

“And I.” 

“I come seeking him.” 

“Why here?” 

“An oracle, deeming it a pro- 
pitious spot. And while I am not 
eager to battle heroes — knowing 
you as such — I feel you owe me 
an apology for the entrance I re- 
ceived.” 

“Fair enough,” says Madrak, “for 
know that our cockles have been 

81 




raised by a recent battle and we 
have spent the past hours waxing 
wroth. Will a swig of good red 
wine convey our sentiments — com- 
ing from what is, doubtless, the 
only flask of the stuff on this 
world?” 

‘It should suffice, if it be of 
good quality.” 

“Bide then a moment.” 

Madrak fetches forth his wine 
bulb, swigs a mouthful to show it 
unsullied, casts about the room. 

“A fit container, sir,” he says, 
and raises up the downturned gob- 
let which lies upon the table. Wip- 
ing it with a clean cloth, he fills 
it and proffers it to the god. 

“Thank you, warrior priest. I ac- 
cept it in the spirit in which it was 
offered. What battle was it which 
so upset you that you forgot your 
manners?” 

“That, Brown-eyed Horus, was 
the battle of Blis, between the Steel 
General and the one who is called 
Wakim the Wanderer.” 

“The Steel General? Impossible! 
He has been dead for centuries. I 
slew him myself!” 

“Many have slain him. None 
have vanquished him.” 

“That pile of junk upon the 
table? Could that truly be the 
Prince of Rebels, \^ho one time 
faced me like a god?” 

“Before your memory, Horus, 
was he mighty,” says Vramin, “and 
when men have forgotten Horus, 
still will there be a Sted General. 



It matters not which side he fights 
upon. Win or lose, he is the spirit 
of rebellion, which can never die.” 
“I like not this talk,” says Horus. 
“Sturely, if one were to number all 
his parts and destroy them, one by 
one, and scatter them across the en- 
tire cosmos, then would he cease 
to exist.” 

“This thing has been done. And 
over the centuries have his follow- 
ers collected him and assembled the 
engine again. This man, this Wakim, 
whose like I have never seen be- 
fore,” says Vramin, “voiced a simi- 
lar sentiment before the fugue bat- 
tle which racked half a world. The 
only thing which keeps them from 
laying waste — excuse the poor 
choice of words — to this world 
Marachek is that I will not permit 
them to awaken again from a state 
of temporal shock.” 

“WaJdm? This is the deadly 
Wakim? Yes. I can believe it as I 
look upon him in repose. Have you 
any idea who he is really? Such 
champions do not spring full-grown 
from the void.” 

“I know nothing of him, save 
that he is a mighty wrestler and a 
master of the fugue, come to Blis 
in her last days before the dark 
tides swept over her — perhaps to 
hasten their coming.” 

“That is all you know of him?” 
“That is all I know.” 

“And you, mighty Madrak?” 
“The sum of my knowledge, al- 
so.^’

^^Supposing we were to awaken 
him and question him?’^ 

Vramin raises his cane. 

^‘Touch him and I shall dispute 
your passage. He is too fearsome 
an individual, and we came here 
to rest.” 

Homs lays a hand upon Wakim^s 
shoulder and shakes him slightly. 
Wakim moans. 

‘‘Know that the wand of life is 
also a lance of death 1” cries 
Vramin, and with a lunging mo- 
tion spears the toad, which sits 
immediately beside Horus’s left 
hand. 

T> efore Horus can turn upon him, 
^ there is a quick outward rush 
of air as the toad explodes into a 
towering form in the center of the 
table. 

His long golden hair stands high 
and his thin lips draw back in a 
smile, as his green eyes fall upon 
the tableau at his feet. 

The Prince Who Had Been A 
Toad touches a red spot on his 
shoulder, says to Vramin, “Did you 
not know that it has been wrtten. 
‘Be kind to bird and beastV” 

“Elipling,” says Vramin, smiling. 
“Also, the Koran.” 

“Shape-shifting miscreant,” says 
Horus, “are you the one I seek — 
called by many the Prince?” 

“I confess to this title. Know 
that you have disturbed my medita- 
tions.” 

“Prepare to meet your doom,” 



says Horus, drawing an arrow — 
his only weapon — from his belt, 
and breaking off its head. 

“Do you think that 1 am unaware 
of your power, brother?” says the 
Prince, as Horus raises the arrow- 
head between thumb and fore- 
finger. “Do you think, brother, that 
I do not know that you can add 
the power of your mind to the mass 
or velocity of any object, increas- 
ing it a thousandfold?” 

There is a blur in the vicinity of 
Horus^s hand and a crashing sound 
across the room, as the Prince 
stands suddenly two feet to the left 
of where he had been standing and 
the arrowhead pierces a six-inch 
wall of metal and continues on in- 
to what is now a dusty and windy 
morning as the Prince continues 
to speak: “And do you not know, 
brother, that I could as easily have 
removed myself an inconceivable 
distance across space with the same 
effort as it took me to avoid your 
shot? Yea, out of the Middle 
Worlds themselves?” 

“Call me not brother,” says 
Horus, raising the shaft of the ar- 
row. 

“But thou art my brother,” says 
the Prince. “At least, we^d the same 
mother.” 

Horus drops the shaft. 

“I believe you not!” 

“And from what strain do you 
think you derived your godlike pow- 
ers? Osiris? Cosmetic surgery might 
have given him a chicken^s head,

and his own dubious strain an apti- 
tude for mathematics — but you 
and I, shapeshifters both, are sons 
of Isis, Witch of the Loggia,” 
“Cursed be my mother’s name I” 
Suddenly, the Prince stands be- 
fore him on the floor of the chamber 
and slaps him with the back of his 
hand. 

“I could have slain you a dozen 
times over, had I chosen,” says the 
Prince, “as you stood there. But 
I refrained, for you are my brother. 
I could slay you now, but I will 
not. For you are my brother. I bear 
no arms, for I need none. I bear 
no malice, or the burden of my life 
would be staggering. But do not 
speak ill of our mother, for her 
ways are her own. I neither praise 
nor do I blame. I know that you 
have come here to kill me. If you 
wish to enjoy an opportunity to 
do so, you will hold your tongue 
in this one respect, brother.” 

“Then let us speak no more of 
her.” 

“Very well. You know who my 
father was, so you know that I am 
not unversed in the martial arts. I 
will give you a chance to slay me 
in hand-to-hand combat, if you 
will do a thing for me first. Other- 
wise, I will remove myself and find 
someone else to assist me, and you 
may spend the rest of your days 
seeking me.” 

C4'"T^hen this must be what the 
^ oracle meant,” says Horus, 

THE STEEL GENERAL 



“and it bodes ill for me. Yet I 
cannot pass up the chance to ful- 
fill my mission, before Anubis’s 
emissary — this Wakim — adiieves 
it. For I know not his powers, 
which might exceed your own. I will 
keep my peace, run your errand 
and kill you.” 

“This man is the assassin from 
the House of the Dead?” says the 
Prince, looking upon Wakim. 

“Yes.” 

“Were you aware of this, my 
Angel of the Seventh Station?” 
asks the Prince. 

“No,” says Vramin, bowing 
slightly. 

“Nor I, Lord” — Madrak. 

“Arouse him — and the General.” 

“Our bargain is off,” say Horus, 
“if this be done.” 

“Awaken them both,” says the 
Prince, folding his arms. 

Vramin raises his cane, and the 
green tongues come forth and de- 
scend upon the prostrate forms. 

Outside, the winds grow more 
noisy. Horus shifts his attention 
from one to the other of those 
present, then speaks: “Your back 
is to me, brother. Turn around that 
I may face you as I slay you. As I 
said, our bargain is off.” 

The Prince turns. 

“I need these men, also.” 

Horus shakes his head and raises 
his arm. 

Then, “A veritable family re- 
union,” says the voice which fills 
the chamber, “we three brothers 

85 




having come together at last.” 
Horus draws back his hand as 
from .an asp^ for the shadow of a 
dark horse lies between himself and 
the Prince. He covers his eyes with 
one hand and lowers his head. “I 
had forgotten,” he says, ^^that by 
what I learned today, I am also kin 
to thee.” 

''Take it not too badly,” says the 
voice, ‘‘for I have known it for ages 
and learned to live with it.” 

And Wakim and the Steel Gen- 
eral awaken to a sound of laughter 
that is like the singing wind.

/^fiiris, holding a skull and de- 
pressing a stud on its side, 
addi?esses it, saying: “Once mortal, 
you have come to dwell in the 
House of Life forever. Once beauty, 
blooming fair atop a spinal column, 
you withered. Once truth, you have 
come to this.” 

“And who,” answers the skull, 
“is papetrater of this thing? It is 
the Lord of the House of Life that 
will not let me know rest.” 

And Osiris makes answer, saying: 
“Know, too, that I use thee for a 
paperweight.” 

“If ever thou didst love me, then 
smadi me and let me diel Do not 
continue to nourish a fragment of 
she who once loved thee.” 

“Ah, but dear my lady, one day 
mig^t I re-embody thee, to feel thy 
caresses again.” 

80 



“The thought of this thing repels 
me.” 

“And I, also. But one day it 
might amuse me.” 

“Dost thou torment all who dis- 
please thee?” 

“No, no, shell of death, think 
never thatl True, the Angel of the 
Nineteenth House attempted to 
slay me, and his nervous system 
lives, threaded amidst the fibers of 
this carpet I stand upon; and true, 
others of my enemies exist in ele- 
mentary forms at various points 
within my House — such as fire- 
places, ice lockers and ashtrays. But 
think not that I am vindictive. No, 
never. As Lord of Life, I feel an 
obligation to repay all things 
which have threatened life.” 

“I did not threaten thee, my 
Lord.” 

“You threatened my peace of 
mind.” 

“Because I resembled thy vrife, 
the Lady Isis?” 

“Silence I” 

“Ayel I resembled the Queen of 
Harlots, thy bride. For this reason 
didst thou desire me and desire my 
undoing — ” 

The skull’s words are then cut 
short, however, as Osiris has hurled 
it against the wall. 

As it falls to pieces and chemicals 
and microminiature circuitry are 
spread upon the carpet, Osiris 
curses and falls upon a row of 
switches at his desk, the depression 
of which gives rise to a multitude 

IF 




of voices, one of which, above the 
others, cries out, through a speaker 
set high upon the wall: 

“Oh clever skull, to so have trick- 
ed the fink godl^’ 

Consulting the panel and seeing 
that it is the carpet which has 
spoken, Osiris moves to the center 
of the room and begins jumping up 
and down. 

There grows up a field of wail- 
ing. 

VIII 

Tnto the places of darkness and 
^ disrepute, upon the world called 
Waldik, enter the two champions, 
Madrak and Typhon. Sent by 
Thoth Hermes Trismegistes to steal 
a glove of singular potency, they 
are come to do battle with the guar- 
dian of that glove. Now, the world 
Waldik, long ago ravaged, hosts an 
horde of beings who dwell beneath 
its surface in caverns and chambers 
far removed from the courts of day 
and night. Darkness, dampness, 
mutation, fratricide, incest and rape 
are the words most often used by 
the few who offer commentary up- 
on the world Waldik. Transported 
there by a piece of spatial hijack- 
ery known only to the Prince, the 
champions will succeed or remain. 
They go now through burrows, hav- 
ing been told to follow the bellow- 
ing. 

“Think you, dark horse shadow,” 
asks the warrior-priest, th^ thy 
THE STEEL GENERAL 



brother can retrieve us at the proper 
moment?” 

“Yes,” replies the shadow that 
moves at his side. “Though if he 
cannot, I care not. I can remove 
myself in my own way whenever 
I wish.” 

“Yes, but I cannot.” 

“Then worry it, fat Dad. I care 
not. You volunteered to accompany 
me. I did not request this thing,” 

“Then into the hands of What- 
ever May Be that is greater than 
life or death, I resign myself — 
if this act will be of any assistance 
in preserving my life. If it will not, 
I do not. If my saying this thing 
at all be presumptuous, and there- 
fore not well received by Whatever 
may or may not care to listen, then 
I withdraw the statement and ask 
forgiveness, if this thing be desired. 
If not, I do not. On the other 
hand — ” 

“Amen! And silence, please!” 
rumbles Typhon. “I have heard a 
thing like a bellow — to our left.” 

Shding invisible along the dark 
wall, Typhon rounds the bend and 
moves ahead. Madrak squints 
through infrared glasses and splays 
his beam like a blessing upon every- 
thing encountered. 

“These caverns be deep and 
vasty,” he whispers. 

There is no reply. 

Suddenly he comes to a door 
which may be the right door. 

Opening it, he meets the mino- 
taur. 



87 




He raises his staff, but the thing 
vanishes in a twinkling. 

‘‘Where . .?” he inquires. 

“Hiding/’ says Typhon, suddenly 
near, “somewhere within the many 
twistings and turnings of its lair.’’ 

“Why is this?” 

“It would seem that its kind are 
hunted by creatures much like 
yourself, both for food and man/ 
bull-headed trophies. It fears direct 
battle, therefore, and retreats — 
for man uses weapons upon cattle. 
Let us enter the labyrinth and hope 
not to see it again. The entrance- 
way we seek, to the lower cham- 
bers, lies somewhere within.” 

^or perhaps half a day they wan- 
^ der, unsuccessfully seeking the 
Wrong Door. Three doors do they 
come upon, but only bones lie be- 
hind. 

“I wonder how the others fare?” 
asks the warrior-priest. 

“Better, or worse — or perhaps 
the same,” replies the other, and 
laughs. 

Madrak does not laugh. 

Coming into a circle of bones, 
Madrak sees the charging beast 
barely in time. He raises his staff 
and begins the battle. 

He strikes it between the horns 
and upon the side. He jabs, slashes 
at, pushes, strikes the creature. He 
lod^ with it and wrestles, hand to 
hand. 

Hurting one another, they strive, 
imtil finally Madrak is raised from 
88 



the floor and hurled across the 
chamber, to land upon his left 
shoulder on a pile of bones. As he 
struggles to raise himself, he is sub- 
merged by an ear-breaking bellow. 
Head lowered, the minotaur charg- 
es. Madrak finds his feet and begins 
to rise. 

But a dark horse shadow falls 
upon the creature, and it is gone — 
completely and forever. 

He bows his head and chants the 
Possibly Proper Death Litany. 

“Lovely,” snorts his companion, 
when he comes to his final “Amen.” 
“Now, fat Dad, I think I have 
found us the wrong door. I might 
enter without opening it, but you 
may not. How would you have it?” 

“Bide a moment,” says Madrak, 
standing. “A bit of narcotic and 
I’ll be good as new and stronger 
than before. Then we shall enter 
together.” 

“Very well. I’ll wait.” 

Madrak injects himself and after 
a time is like unto a god. 

“Now show me the door and let 
us go in.” 

“This way.” 

And there is the door, big and 
forbidding and colorless, within the 
infra-light. 

“Open it,” says Typhon, and 
Madrak does. 

In the firelight it plays, worrying 
the gauntlet. Perhaps the size of 
two and a half elephants, it sports 
with its toy there atop an heap of 
bones. One of its heads sniffs at 

IF 




the sudden draft of air from beyond 
the Wrong Door, two of its heads 
snarl and the third drops the glove. 

‘‘Do you understand my voice?” 
asks Typhon, but there is no 
answering intelligence behind its six 
red eyes. Its tails twitch, and it 
stands, all scaley and impervious, 
within the flicker and glow. 

“Nice doggie,” comments Mad- 
rak, and it wags its tails, opens its 
mouths and lunges toward him. 
“Kill it!” cries Madrak, 

“That is impossible,” answers Ty- 
phon. “In time, that is.” 

IX 

C oming at length to the world 
Interludici, and entering through 
the sudden green gateway the poet 
hurls upon the blackness, Wakim 
and Vramin enter the mad world of 
many rains and religions. Light- 
footed, they stand upon the moist 
turf outside a city of terrible black 
walls. 

“We shall enter now,” says the 
poet, stroking his sky-green beard. 
“We shall enter through that small 
door off to the left, which I shall 
cause to open before us. Then will 
we hypnotize or subdue any guards 
who may be present and make our 
way into the heart of the city, 
where the great temple stands.” 

“To steal boots for the Prince,” 
says Wakim. “This is a strange em- 
ployment for one such as myself. 
Were it not for the fact that he had 



promised to give my name back to 
me — my real name — before I 
slay him, I would not have agreed 
to do this thing for hinu” 

“I realize that,” says Vramin, 
“but tell me, what do you intend to 
do with Horns, who would also slay 
him — and who works for him now 
only to gain this same opportun- 
ity?” 

“Slay Horus first, if need be.” 

“The psychology behind this 
thing fascinates me, so I trust you 
will permit me one more question: 
What difference does it make 
whether you slay him or Horus 
slays him? He will be just as dead 
either way.” 

Wakim pauses, apparently con- 
sidering the matter, as if for the 
first time. 

“This thing is my mission, not 
his,” he says at length. 

“He will be just as dead, either 
way,” Vramin repeats. 

“But not by my hand.” 

“True. But I fail to see the dis- 
tinction.” 

“So do I, for that matter. But 
it is I who have been charged with 
the task.” 

“Perhaps Horus has also.” 

“But not by my master.” 

“Why should you have a master, 
Wakim? Why are you not your own 
man?” 

Wakim rubs his forehead. 

“I — do not — really — know. 
But I must do as I am told.” 

“I understand,” says Vramin, and 

89 



THE STEEL GENERAL 




while rWakim is thus distracted, a 
tiny green sps^rk arcs between the 
tip #f the poet’s cane and the back 
of Wakim’s neck. 

He daps at his neck then and 
scratches it. 

“What . .?” 

“A local insect,” says the poet. 
“Let us proceed to the door.” 

The door opens before them, be- 
neath the tapping of his cane, and 
its guards drowse before a brief 
green flare. Appropriating cloaks 
from two of them, Wakim and Vra- 
min move on, into the center of the 
city. 

The temple is easy enough to 
find. Entering it is another matter. 

Here now, there are guards — 
drug-raaddened — before the en- 
trance. 

They approach boldly and de- 
mand admisdon. 

The eighty-eight spears of the 
Outer Guard are leveled at them. 

“There will be no public adora- 
tion tffl the sundown rains,” they 
are told, amidst twitches, 

“We shall wait.” And they do. 

TT^ith the sundown rains, they 
join a procession of moist 
worshippers and entered the outer 
temple. 

On attempting to go further they 
are brought to a halt by the three 
hundred flfty-two drug-maddened 
spearmen who guard the next en- 
traacnway. 

“Have you the badges of inner 



temple worshippers?” their captain 
inquires. 

“Of course,” says Vramin, raising 
his cane. 

And in the eyes of the captain, 
they must have them, for they are 
granted entrance. 

Then, drawing near the Inner 
Sanctum itself, they are halted by 
the officer in charge of the five 
hundred and ten drug-maddened 
warriors who guard the way. 

“Castrated or non-castrated?” he 
inquires. 

“Castrated, of course,” says Vra- 
min in a lovely soprano. “Give us 
entrance,” and his eyes blaze green- 
ly and the officer draws back. 

Entering, they spy the altar, with 
its fifty guardians and its six 
strange priests. 

“There they are, upon the altar.” 
“How shall we obtain them?” 
“By stealth, preferably,” says 
Vramin, pushing his way nearer the 
altar, before the televised service 
begins. 

“What sort of stealth?” 

“Perhaps we can substitute a 
pair of our own and wear the sacred 
ones out of here.” 

“I’m game.” 

“Then, supposing they were 
stolen five minutes ago?” 

“I understand you,” says Wakim 
and bows his head, as in adoration. 
The service begins, 

“Hail to Thee, Shoes,” lisps the 
first priest, “wearer of feet.” 
“Hail!” chant the other five. 






IF 




‘‘Good, kind, noble and blessed 
shoes.” 

“Hail!” 

. Which came to us from 

chaos.” 

“Hail!” 

“. To lighten our hearts and 
uplift our soles.” 

“Hail!” 

“Oh shoes, which have supported 
mankind since the dawn of civili- 
zation . 

“Hail!” 

“. Ultimate cavities, surround- 
ers of feet.” 

“Hail!” 

“Hail! Wondrous, battered bus- 
kins!” 

“We adore thee.” 

^'We adore thee!” 

“We worship thee in the fulness 
of thy shoenessl” 

“Glory!” 

“Oh archetypal footgear I” 
“Glory!” 

“Supreme notion of shoes.” 
“Glory!” 

“What could we do without 
thee?” 

“What?” 

“Stub our toes, scratch our heels, 
have our arches go flat.” 

“Hail!” 

“Protect us, thy worshippers, 
good and blessed footgear!” 

“Which came to us from 
chaos . 

. On a day dark and drear.”

THE STEa GENERAL 



“. Thou hast come to comfort 
and support us.” 

“. To sustain and enliven 
us.” 

“Hail!” 

“. Upright, forthright ^d for- 
ward forever!” 

“Forever!” 

Wakim vanishes. 

A cold, wild wind begins to 
blow about them. 

It is the change-wind out of 
time; and there is a blurring upon 
the altar. 

Seven previously drug-maddened 
spearmen lay sprawled, their necks 
at unusual angles. 

Suddenly, beside Vramin, Wakim 
says, “Pray, find us a gateway 
quickly!” 

“You wear them?” 

“I wear them.” 

Vramin raises his cane and 
pauses. 

“There will be a brief delay, I 
fear,” and his gaze grows emerald 
green. 

All eyes in the temple are sud- 
denly upon them. 

Forty- three drug-maddened spear- 
men shout a battle cry, as one, leap 
forward. 

Wakim crouch^ and extends his 
hands. 

“Such is the kingdom of heaven,” 
comments Vramin, perspiration like 
absinthe glittering coldly upon his 
brow. 

“I wonder just how the video 
tapes will show this thing?” 

VI 




X 

iiXT^bat is this place?” Homs 
^^cries out. 

The Steel General stands braced, 
as for an anticipated shock, but 
there is none. 

^^We are come to a place that is 
not a world, but simply a place,” 
says the Prince Who Was A Thou- 
sand. “There is no gr 9 und to stand 
upon, nor need of it here. There is 
little light, but those who dwell in 
this place are blind, so it does not 
matter. The temperature will suit 
itself to any living body, because 
those who dwell here wish it so. 
Nourishment is drawn from this 
air like water, through which we 
move, so there is no need to eat. 
And such is the nature of this 
place that one need never sleep 
here.” 

“It sounds rather like Hell,” Hor- 
ns observes. 

“Nonsense,” says the Steel Gen- 
eral. "My own existence is just so, 
as I carry my environment around 
with me. I am not discomfited.” 

“Hell,” Horus repeats. 

“At any rate, take my hands,” 
says the Prince, “and I will guide 
you across the darkness and amid 
the glowing motes’ of light until we 
reach the ones I seek.” 

They link hands; the Prince furls 
his cloak, an they drift through 
the twilitic landscape that is empty 
of horizon. 

“And where is this place that is 



not a world?” asks the General. 

“I do not know,” says the Prince. 
“Perhaps it only exists in some 
dei^ and shiny corner of my dark 
and dirty mind. All that 1 really 
know is the way to reach it.” 

Falling, drifting a timeless time, 
they come at last to a tent like a 
gray cocoon, flickering, above/be- 
low/before them. 

The Prince disengages his hands 
and places his fingertips upon its 
surface. It quivers then, and an 
opening appears, through which he 
passes, a “follow me” drifting back 
over his shoulder. 

Brotz, Purtz and Dulp sit with- 
in, doing something whidi would be 
quite disgusting and unique by hu- 
man standards, but which is normal 
and proper for them^ since they are 
not human and have different stan- 
dards. 

“Greetings, smiths of Norm,” 
says the Prince. “I have come to 
obtain that which I ordered a time 
ago.” 

“I told you he’d cornel” cries 
one of the grayish mounds, twitch- 
ing its long, moist ears. 

“I acknowledge that you were 
correct,” answers another. 

“Yes. Where’s that frawlpin? I 
ought to refrib it once more, be- 
fore . .” 

“Nonsense I It’s perfect.” 

“It is ready then?” inquires the 
Prince. 

“Oh, it’s been ready for ages. 
Herel”

IF 




The :^eaker draws a length of 
cold blue light from a sheath of 
black fabric and offers it to the 
Prince. The Prince takes it into 
his hands, inspects it, nods and re- 
places it within the sheath. 

“Very good.” 

“And the payment?” 

“I have them here.” The Prince 
withdraws a dark case from be- 
neath his cloak and places it in the 
air before him, where of course it 
hangs suspended. “Which of you 
will be first?” 

“He will.” 

“She will.” 

“It will.” 

“Since you cannot decide, I will 
have to do the choosing myself.” 
The Prince opens the case, which 
contains surgical apparatus and an 
extrudable operating light, as all 
three creatures begin to quiver in 
their places. 

“What is happening?” inquires 
Homs, who has entered now and 
stands beside him. 

“I am about to operate on these 
fellows, and I will require your en- 
ormous strength in assistance, as 
well as the General’s.” 

“Operate? To what end?” asks 
the General. 

44^^hey have no eyes,” says the 
Prince, “and they would see 
again. IVe brought three pairs with 
me and I’m going to install them.” 
“This would require eztensiye 
neurological adaptation.” 

94 



“But this has already been done.” 
“By whom?” 

“Myself, the last time I gave 
them eyes.” 

“What became of those?” 

“Oh, they seldom last. After a 
time, their bodies reject them. Gen- 
erally, though, their neighbors blind 
them.” 

“Why is that?” 

“I believe it is because they go 
about boasting how, among all their 
people, only they are able to see. 
This results in a speedy democrati- 
zation of affairs.” 

“ Ghastly 1” says the General, who 
has lost count of his own blindings. 
“I’m minded to stay and fight for 
them.” 

“They would refuse your assis- 
tance,” says the Prince. “Would you 
not?” 

“Of course,” says one of them. 
“We would not employ a mercen- 
ary against our own people,” says 
another. 

“It would violate their rights,” 
says the third. 

“What rights?” 

“Why, to blind us, of course. 
What sort of barbarian are you?” 
“I withdraw my offer.” 

“Thank you.” 

“Thank you.” 

“Thank you.” 

“What assistance will you re- 
quire?” asks Horus. 

“The two of you must seize upon 
my patient and hold him, while I 
perform the surgery.” 



IF 




«Why is that?” 

‘‘Because they are incapable of 
unconsciousness, and no local an- 
esthetics will affect them.” 

“You mean you are going to 
perform delicate surgery on them 
just as they are — exotic surgery, 
at that?” 

“Yes. That is why I will need 
two of you to immobilize each 
patient. They are quite strong.” 
“Why must you do this thing?” 
“Because they want it done. It 
is the price agreed upon for their 
labors,” 

“Whatever for? A few weeks’ 
seeing? And then — what is there 
to see in this place, anyhow? It is 
mainly dust, darkness, a few feeble 
Kghts,” 

“It is their wish to look upon 
each other — and their tools. They 
are the greatest artisans in the uni- 
verse.” 

“Yes, I want to see a frawlpin 
again — if Dulp hasn’t lost it.” 
“And I, a gult.” 

“I, a crabwick.” 

“That which they desire costs 
^em pain, but it will give them 
memories to last for ages.” 

“Yes, it is worth it,” says one, 
“so long as I am not the first.” 
“Nor I.” 

“Nor I.” 

The Prince lays out his instru- 
ments in the middle of the air, 
sterilizes them and points a finger. 

“That one,” he says, and the 
screaming begins. 

THE STEEL GENERAL 



The General turns off his hearing 
and much of his humanity for the 
next several hours. Homs is remind- 
ed of his father’s study; also, of 
Liglamenti, an D’donori. The 
Prince’s hands are steady. 

T^^hen it is done, the creatures 
^ ^ have bandages over their 
faces, which they may not remove 
for a time. All three are moaning 
and crying out. The Prince cleans 
his hands. 

“Thank you. Prince Who Was A 
Surgeon,” says one of the creatures. 

“. For this thing you have 
done to us.” 

“. And for us.” 

“You are welcome, goodly Norns. 
Thank you for a wand well made.” 
“Oh, it was nothing.” 

“. Let us know whenever you 
need another.” 

“. And the price will be the 
same.” 

“Then I shall be going now.” 
“Good-by.” 

“Farewell.” 

“Adieu.” 

“Good seeing to you, my fel- 
lows.” 

And the Prince takes Horus and 
the General in hand, setting all feet 
upon the road to Marachek, which 
is but one step away. 

Behind him there is more wail- 
ing, and things quite normal and 
proper for Noms are quickly and 
frantically done. 

They are back in the Citadel al- 

95 




most before Homs, who knows what 
it is, has succeed^ in drawing the 
blue wand from its sheath at the 
Prince’s side. 

It is a duplicate of the weapon 
which sun-ey^ Set had used against 
the Nameless, a thousand years be- 
fore. 

XI 

AyTadrak has one chance of living 
through the onslaught. He 
throws his staff and dives forward. 

The choice is the right one: 

He passes beneath the dog as it 
leaps, snapping at his staff. 

His hand falls upon the strange 
fabric of the glove the creature had 
been wonying. 

Suddenly, he is comforted by a 
confidence in his invincibility. This 
is something even the narcotic had 
not fuDy instilled in him. 

Quickly, he determines the cause 
and slips the glove upon the right 
hand. 

The dog turns as Typhon rears. 

The black shadow falls between 
them. 

Tickling, stirring, the glove 
reaches to Madrak’s elbow, spreads 
across his back, his chest. 

The dog lunges and then howls, 
for the dark horse shadow comes 
upon it. One head hangs lifeless as 
ihe others snarl. 

"Depart, oh Madrak, to the ap- 
pointed place!” sa3^ Typhon. "I 
sbaHH occupy this creature to its 
96 



destmction and follow in my own 
way!” 

The glove moves down his left 
arm, covers the hand, ^edds across 
his chest, reaches down to his waist 

Madrak, who has always been 
mighty, suddenly reaches forth and 
crushes a stone within his right 
hand. 

"I fear it not, Typhon. I’ll des- 
troy it myself.” 

“In my brother’s name, I bid thee 
go!” 

Bowing his head, Madrak de- 
parts. Behind him, the soimds of 
battle rage. He moves through the 
lair of the minotaur. He makes his 
way upward through the corridors. 

Pale creatures with green, glow- 
ing eyes accost him. He slays them 
easily with his hands and proceeds. 

When the next group of attackers 
moves upon him, he subdues them 
but does not slay them, having had 
time to think. 

Instead, he says: 

“It might be good for you to 
consider the possibility of your hav- 
ing portions of yourselves which 
might withstand the destruction of 
your bodies, and to label these 
hypothetical quantities souls, for 
the sake of argument. Now then, be- 
ginning with the proposition that 
such — ” 

But they attack him again, and 
he is forced to slay them all. 

“Pity,” he says, and repeats the 
Possibly Proper Death Litany. 

Proceeding upward, he comes at 

IF 




last to the appointed place. And 
there he stands. 

At the Gateway to the Under- 
world .... 

On Waldik .... 

‘‘Hell hath been harrowed,” he 
says. “I am half invincible. This 
must be the gauntlet of Set. Strange 
that it but half covers me. But 
perhaps I’m more a man than he 
was.” Stomach then regarded, “And 
perhaps not. But the power that 
lies in this thing .... Mighty! 
To beat the filthy souled into sub- 
mission and effect their conversions 
— perhaps this is why it was ren- 
dered into my hand. Is Thoth di- 
vine? Truly, I do not know. I won- 
der? If he is, then I wrong him by 
not delivering it. Unless, of course, 
this is his secret will.” Regards 
hands enmeshed, “My power is now 
beyond measure. How shall I use 
it? All of Waldik might I convert 
with this instrument, given but 
time.” Then, “But he charged me 
with a specific task. Yet. ” 
Smile, (The mesh does not cover 
his face,) “What if he is divine? 
Sons who beget their fathers may 
well be. I recall the myth of Eden. 
I know this serpent-like glove may 
indicate the Forbidden.” Shrugs, 
“But the good "which might be 
done . .No! It is a trap! But 
I could beat the Words into their 

heads I’ll do it! ‘Though Hell 

gape wide,’ as Vramin says.” 

But as he turns, he is caught 
up in a vortex that sucks the words 
THE STEEL GENERAL 



from his throat and casts him down 
a wid^ blank, cold welL 
Bdiind him, the ^dows strive, 
Waldik gapes wide, and then he is 
gone, for the Prince has called him 
home.

/^n Marachek, in the Citadd, 
stand they all, there, as back- 
ward reel their minds. 

“I’ve the shoes,” says Wakim. 
“You may have them for my name.” 
“I’ve the glove,” says Madrak 
and turns away his face. 

“And I’ve tke wand,” says Hor- 
us, and it falls from his hand. 

“It did not pass through me,” 
says the Prince, “because it is not 
formed of matter, nor any other 
thing over which you may exercise 
control.” And the mind of the 
Prince is closed to the inner eye of 
Horus. 

Horus steps forward*, and his left 
leg is longer than his right leg, but 
he is perfectly balanced upon the 
now uneven floor; the window 
burns like a sun at the Prince’s 
back, and the Steel General is turn- 
ed to gold and flowing; Vramin 
burns like a taper and Madrak be- 
comes a fat doll bounding, at the 
end of a rubber strand; the walls 
growl and pulse in and out with a 
regular rhythm keeping time with 
the music that comes from the shuf- 
fling bars of the spectrum upon the 
floor at the end of the tunnel that 

97 




begins with the window and lies like 
burning honey and the tiger above 
the wand now grown monstrous and 
too fine to behold within the eterni- 
ty of the tower room in the Citadel 
of Marachek at Midworlds^ Center 
where the Prince has raised his 
smile. 

Horus advances another step, 
and his body is transparent to his 
sense, so that all things within him 
become immediately known and 
frightening. 

‘^Oh, the moon comes like a genie 
from the Negro lamp of night, 
and the tunnel of my seeing 
is her roadway. 

She raises up the carpet of the 

days 

IVe walked upon, 
and through caverns of the 
sky we make our path- 
way,” 

says a voice strangely like yet un- 
like Vramin’s. 

And Horus raises his hand against 
the Prince. 

But the Prince already holds his 
wrist in a grip that burns. 

And Horus raises up his other 
hand against the Prince. 

But the Prince already holds 
that wrist in a grip that freezes. 

And he raises up his other hand, 
and electrical shoc^ pass along it. 

And he raises up his other hand, 
and it blackens and dies. 

And he raises up a hundred 
hands more, and they turn to snakes 
and fight among themsdves and of 
98 



course he whispers: “What has hap- 
pened?” 

“A world,” says the Prince, “to 
which I have transported us.” 

“It is unfair to choose such a 
battleground,” says Horus, “a world 
too like the one I know — only a 
fraction away and so twisted,” and 
his words are all the colors of Blis. 

“And it is indecent of you to 
want to kill me.” 

“I have been charged with this 
thing, and it is my will also.” 

“So you have failed,” says the 
Prince, forcing him to kneel upon 
the Milky Way, which becomes a 
transparent intestinal track, racked 
by a rapid peristalsis. 

The smell is overpowering. 
“Nol” whispers Horus. 

“Yes, brother. You are defeated. 
You cannot destroy me. I have best- 
ed you. It is time to quit, to resign, 
to go home.” 

“Not until I have accomplished 
my objective.” 

^^he stars, like ulcers, burn within 
his guts, and Horus pits the 
strength of his body against the 
kaleidoscope that is the Prince. 
The Prince drops to one knee, but 
with his genuflection there comes a 
hail of hosannas from the innumer- 
able dogfaced flowers that bloom 
upon his brow like sweat and merge 
to a mask of glass which cradks and 
unleashes lightnings. Horus pushes 
his arms toward the nineteen moons

Illustrated by 



To a Gen, the Changeover can be 



I 

^lad blissfully in my old shorts 
^ and sandals instead of the cov- 
er-every-inch costume the Gens 
required at their medical school, I 
headed outdoors to soak up some 



Indian Summer heat. I was glad 
nobody was home when I got there. 
The privacy would let the reson- 
ant peace of the ranch heal my 
nerves before I launched my attack 
on the Retainer Laws. 

I paused in the kitchen, mas- 



99 







saging my wrists and forearms, ex- 
tending and flexing all the tentacles 
and trying to relieve the bruised 
soreness and tingling that still lin- 
gered twelve hours after shedding 
my retainers at the Sime Territory 
border. At last, I^d received my 
M.B. and was home, the place that 
had haunted my dreams for the last 
two years at New Harvard. 

The ranch had always been our 
week-end retreat. We allowed no 
life-pewered services, preferring to 
use medianical door locks, a petro- 
chemical stove and heater, electro- 
chemical lights, and a really an- 
cient ice box — no power, just ice. 
We get along well without hot run- 
ning water and vigorously enforced 
our ban on all powered communica- 
tions instruments, public and pri- 
vate. 

It was a bubble of rustic isola- 
tion perfect for Noadron, that vital- 
ly necessary Sime discipline that re- 
lieves the tension of constant trans- 
fer denial demanded by life among 
the non-Donor Gens, and that’s 
what I was here for. 

I went out the kitchen door onto 
the patio, letting the screen clatter 
lopadedly shut behind me. The 
single-floored, rambling structure 
was surrounded on two sides by the 
patio and its roof-high, whitewashed 
wall. The third side was the gar- 
age; the whole back of the house 
was a glassed-in sun porch with a 
view of an ancient pine forest. 

I stood on the patio, luxuriating 



in the dry heat. Extending my 
grasping tentacles to the fullest, I 
jumped and caught the beam con- 
necting the patio wall to the roof. 
I was shocked when I had to sup- 
port my weight on my hands, the 
tentacles were so weakened by con- 
stant use of retainers. 

Walking out into the yard, I 
looked back at the house with the 
perspective of years. It seemed to 
crouch in the middle of our ten 
acres of rocky, virgin hills like some 
sort of invader, not really a part 
of the country. 

With renewed purpose, I strode 
toward the back, bearing left away 
from the pines, stepping carefully, 
mindful of my bared toes. Five min- 
utes later, lying among the summer- 
parched grasses of my favorite hill- 
side, I studied wisps of cloud roiling 
in stratospheric breezes and relaxed 
into the vaulted infinity with no 
field gradient other than my own 
to distract me. 

XTf^ould it really be a good thing 
to walk among the Gen life- 
potential fields unprotected by re- 
tainers? As a QN-1 class channel, 
I wouldn’t be bothered as much as 
a simple Q-class Sime, but still, 
I did rely on retainers for comfort 
in the steep field potentials of non- 
Donors. 

The Gens, the Generators, the 
normal humans, invented retainers 
about four hundred years ago so 
that the Sime mutants they cap- 

IF 



100 




tured during the Sime Wars could 
not attack and kill them by strip- 
ping them of life-energy. As con- 
tact developed into integration, 
any Sime not wearing retainers was 
shot on sight. 

Then the channels appeared. They 
were like the ordinary Sime in ev- 
ery respect except that they could 
take life-energy from a Gen without 
killing, and later transfer it to the 
ordinary Sime, satisfying his desire 
for a kill. 

Now many Gens donate life in 
return for the life-powered services 
only Simes can provide, and the 
penalty for not wearing retainers 
in Gen Territory is deportation to 
Sime Territory. 

The time for change had again 
arrived. 

I held up my right arm and ex- 
tended the moist pink-gray laterals. 
Used only in life-transfer, but they 
loved freedom and sunshine, not 
the confining and heavy retainers. 
I extended the two dorsal and two 
ventral gripping tentacles, touching 
the tips of my fingers. By contrast, 
these were sinewy ropes with a 
smooth, dry, ordinary skin. Their 
strength and dexterity were the 
joy of Sime musicians and artists 
everywhere except in Gen Territory, 
where, needlessly immobilized in re- 
tainers, they became weak and 
clumsy. 

I was determined to present my 
argument and my inventions to 
Grandpa Digen tonight. If I could 



convince him that the time was 
right to force the issue. 

A fter dinner, Grandpa Digen and 
I sat alone on the sun porch 
watching darkness engulf the pine 
forest. Aunt Clar was puttering 
in the kitchen as women do, and no- 
body else was about. Cousin Dori- 
en and his family wouldn’t come 
until later. 

Grandpa Digen is really my great 
grandfather. A hundred and twenty 
is old even for a Sime, so I wanted 
to broach the subject gently and 
keep the talk quiet. 

'^Did you hear about the Sime, 
Ray Bilton I think his name was, 
who tripped on a crowded walk- 
way a few days ago and knocked 
a Gen into the path of a truck?” 
^^No, I didn’t. What happened?” 
'^The Gen was hospitalized. The 
Gen police didn’t hold Bilton re- 
sponsible, but the Sime investiga- 
tion turned up that he’d been wear- 
ing retainers, more than twelve 
hours. They blamed his careless- 
ness on the cumulative effect of 
the pain and discomfort and let it 
go at that.” 

There ought to be a law against 
wearing retainers more than twelve 
hours.” 

disagree. There ought not to 
be a law requiring retainers when 
they are not needed.”

fortable retainers, so why not?” 

'^I have?” Grandpa was really 
interested now. 

I reached into my pocket and 
brought forth my ring. It glittered 
red-gold in the dying sunlight. ^^It’s 
crude because I didn’t have tools 
to make real jewelry.” I pointed out 
the half-inch rounded crown where 
the stone would be. ^^The mecha- 
nism is here. I call it an attenuator 
because it attenuates field gradients 
by several dynopters with absolute- 
ly no cumulative discomfort. Here, 
try it.” 

He took it and put -it on his ring 
finger a bit gingerly. 

^^Hol How about that! It really 
does.” He took it off to look it 
over carefully. 

”It’s my own invention. I want 
to market it, but I don’t know 
where to begin. I have something 
else, too.” I took out my other 
prize. Grandpa looked at it. 

^Xooks like half a sleeve. The

”I call it a damper and I believe 
it will replace the retainer. You 
slip it on like this, fasten this strap 
below the elbow and hook this loop 
around your middle finger to keep 
it from twisting. Now this material 
strip hugs the lateral and com- 
pletely cuts off field sensation from 
that lateral only.” I showed him 
closely in the fading light. There 
is none of the discomfort and disor- 
ientation of the regulation model, 
and it leaves all handling tentacles 



free. You only wear it on one lat- 
eral at a time so there’s no prob- 
lem of over sensitization, and it’s 
quite comfortable. 

'fl^hile Grandpa gave it the 
^ ^ same careful inspection, I 
continued, ^Tt will provide as much 
protection for the Gens as the re- 
tainers; and used with an attenua- 
tor, it can make any Sime reason- 
ably comfortable in any field gradi- 
ent, even direct skin contact. No 
time limit. No agony. No torture. 
The problem is to convince them 
of that.” 

No family patriarch was ever 
more respected than Grandpa Dig- 
en. What he said went. I waited 
anxiously while he pondered. With 
family help, the first step of my 
crusade would be easy. To market 
my inventions for private use of 
Simes — for instance exchange 
students living with all-Gen fami- 
lies, or for medical therapy — 
and then get accepted by the Gens. 
The second step — to put the use 
of them completely at the discre- 
tion of the individual Sime — 
would take much longer and be 
more difficult. 

At last Grandpa spoke. ^^That 
will require convincing the Gen 
public that transfer cannot possi- 
bly take place without all four lat- 
erals in skin contact. We’d have 
to get their congress to legalize the 
things. We’d have to get our congress 
to define criteria for need of them.

IF 




It would mean a tremendous pub- 
lic relations campaign to drum up 
Gen sympathy for their suffering 
Sime friends. ...” 

He trailed off, and I sat perfectly 
still holding my breath as it became 
completely dark. The old man still 
had a quick intelligence, a lighten- 
ing grasp of the heights and depths 
of a problem. 

When he spoke again, it was with 
a fired enthusiasm. ^^What a fight 
that would make I What a crusade! 
I’m going to do it. My last crusade, 
my last project.” 

I leaned back with an explosive 
high. Now to business. 

'IT^hile I spent the next ten days 
^ ^ in Noadron, relaxing, quietly 
motionless for hours at a time, 
Grandpa Digen made plans and 
contacted people. Each evening 
we’d sit and watch the sunset and 
he’d tell me how it was going. 

The first night he reported that 
he had spoken to several Sime 
manufacturing firms and a patent 
attorney. My inventions would be 
on the market in all Sime terri- 
tories within the month. 

A few days later, he had ar- 
ranged for a publisher to put out 
a book about transfer mechanics 
and field-gradient sensing written 
in an easy, popular style. Also, he 
had someone working to change the 
image of the Sime in Gen Action 
from the aloofly non-participant — 
which was the least explosive he’d 



been able to manage when he was 
running his integration crusade — 
to sensitive, long-suffering, u»der- 
standing, human type people. In a 
few weeks we’d start pushing stories 
about retainer incidents. 

He organized the whole thing so 
well that I began to feel it wasn’t 
my project. But on the tenth day, 
we were sitting on the porch again, 
after dinner. 

^^Well, son, have you had enough 
Noadron to last you a while?” 
^^Yes, quite enough.” 

^^That’s good. Feel up to a little 
trip into Washington?” 

^'Washington? The Gen capitol?” 
"Hmmmm.” He nodded affirma- 
tively. 

'T suppose so. Why?” 

"Operation High Time is your 
baby. It’s time you took over. I’m 
too old to travel and too weak to 
button hole, browbeat, cajole, ar- 
gue and plead. That’s your job and 
you’re scheduled to start with some 
lobbying in Washington.” 

'^he next morning, I was still say- 
ing to myself, over and over, 
"Me? Lobby? In Washington?” I 
felt unsure as I boarded the special 
helicopter Grandpa had arranged 
for me. 

It just didn’t fit my self-image. 
What does a young doctor who 
should be interning in somethingor- 
other Memorial Hospital know 
about politics? Still, I’d asked for 
it when I started this whole thing. 



OPERATION HIGH TIME 



103 




As I climbed into the chopper 

— life-powered, not petrochemical 

— the pilot, a Q-dass Sime, began 
to modulate the three dynopter 
fields that twirled our blades, and 
we were off. 

Cross country from the Pacific 
Ocean to Washington-on-Potomac 
in a two-seat whirly would be im- 
possible if we couldn’t hop from 
one Sime island territory to the next 
for re-fueling, that is taking on new 
life-packed batteries. 

We arrived at the Sime Reserve 
just south of the Potomac border 
of Washington about dark, and I 
decided to stay at the Harvington 
Ward for the night before plunging 
into the Gen area. The Sime Re- 
serve is not really a Sime Territory. 
It’s a legal fiction, like a foreign 
embassy. Its borders are sacrosanct 
and it’s internally under Sime 
law, but it’s only the size of a small 
city, not the usual few hundred 
miles across. From my room in the 
Ward, I could see the Gen capitol 
afire with colored lights designed 
to make the buildings look impres- 
sive, which was unnecessary. They 
were. What was impressive to me 
was that of all that electricity, 
probably sixty percent was life- 
powered. 

The next morning I claimed the 
car Grandpa had reserved for me 
and drove into the Gen Capitol. It 
was one of those magnificantly alive 
fall days that can following misery 
of a Washington summer. 



I had a ten o’clock appointment 
with Jon Izak whom Grandpa had 
only identified as a professional 
lobb3dst. Izak’s plush suite was 
across the street from the Senate 
offices. His private office cowered 
behind three rooms full of secre- 
taries and stenographers. In his 
office, I waited for him while 
gloomily contemplating how I’d 
stopped every machine in the place 
simply by walking in the door. Evi- 
dently, they weren’t expecting a 
Sime. 

”So you’re Mairis Farris!” 

The voice that came from behind 
me would have boomed fifty years 
ago. Now it croaked huskily. I was 
startled enough to jump to my 
feet.‘ I hadn’t felt the field gradi- 
ent increase because I was wearing 
retainers, of course. 

”Well, turn around, let me have 
a look at you.” 

T turned obediently while exam- 
ining the speaker. He was a 
Gen. Maybe eighty or eighty-five. 
A little shorter than my five-foot- 
eleven,* portly but not obese. He 
looked like an elder statesman, 
complete with silver-knobbed cane. 

He snapped a formidable-looking 
lock on the door and hobbled to 
his polished dest, gesturing at me. 
^^Take them things off and make 
yourself at home. You’re the spit- 
tin’ image of your grandfather, 
you know that?” 

”No, sir, I didn’t,” I said, so sur- 

IF 



104 




prised I actually started removing 
my retainers. Then, I realized what 
I was doing and stopped, horrified. 

”Go onl Go on!^’ the old man 
[wompted. ^^Your grandfather and 
I worked together many years ago. 
I’ll never forget it. Crusades he 
called ’em! Hah! I’ll never forget 
the time. No, not now. Digen 
got me out of retirement to give 
you a hand, not a lecture. You com- 
fortable?” 

''Yes, sir,” I said. 

"Well, I’m going to give you a 
hand. In fact my whole organiza- 
tion is going to give you multiple 
hands, but we won’t do your work 
for you. You’ve got about three 
weeks of good hard leg work to do. 
Think you’re up to it?” 

"Yes, sir,” I said, not at all sure 
I was. 

"Good! Now, my son generally 
runs this place these days, but he’s 
off helping his wife have a baby, 
so we’ll just have to get along with- 
out him.” He started hunting, 
through drawers. 

"I don’t know anything about 
this sort of work, sir, I’m just an 
intern.” 

"Well, you can talk can’t you?” 

"Yes,” I said, bewildered. 

"Retainers drive you crazy, don’t 
they?” 

I nodded again. He seemed to 
know all about me. 

"All right. All you have to do is 
be yourself. Project your sincerity 
for your cause. Tell ’em like they 

OPERATION HIGH TIME 



never heard it before. You’ll do all 
right. 

"Ah. Here they are!” he pro- 
duced a stack of papers. 

"Briefly, the situation is this. 
There’s a bill up before the Sen- 
ate.” He handed me a paper. "Says 
that public establishments, restau- 
rants, theaters, even buses, have 
the right to designate areas where 
Simes may enjoy the services with- 
out having to wear retainers. It’s 
been up in one form or another 
several years now, but always dies 
in committee. You’re going to see 
every member of that committee, 
and you’re going to talk that bill 
onto the floor. Here are your ap- 
pointments.” He handed me anoth- 
er paper. 

"Next year, when the public 
has been softened up a bit, we’ll 
get a bill legalizing your inven- 
ventions. Meantime, you’ve got to 
convince these men that retainers 
are painful, therefore dangerous, 
and public rest areas should be pro- 
vided for those who want ’em. 
Here’s a bunch of statistics. Memo- 
rize ’em and use ’em. Good luck.” 

T found myself on the street, my 
head whirling like the blades 
of the copter that had brought 
me here. It didn’t stop whirling for 
three weeks. I talked. I saw every- 
one on the list several times. I 
learned to recognize influential 
Senators and catch them in restau- 
rants, corridors, even the mens’ 



105 




room. Soon everybody knew me; in 
fact they and their secretaries 
knew me better than I knew them. 
Which sometimes wasn’t so good. 

Then it was the big morning, 
the day the committee would either 
report the bill out or table it for 
the year. I figured it had a good 
chance. I’d convinced a majority 
of the committee. But Senator 
Fieldman, the chairman, was still 
the Opposition. 

Oh, he’d made a lot of public 
noise about how he was all for 
'^humane treatment of our fellow 
humans, the so-called Simes.” And 
the public swallowed it. I’d looked 
up his voting record and I knew 
what to expect. 

So it was with some apprehen- 
sion that I entered the pseudo- 
Grecian building that served the 
Senate. The inside was as modern 
as tomorrow whil^ the outside 
was kept archaic. ”As a link with 
our revered ancestors,” it said over 
the door. I marched self-conscious- 
ly down the long, carpeted, and 
hush-ceilinged corridors, avoiding 
the occasional Gen and hunting 
conference room A-3S. 

I had become quite adept at 
finding my way around govern- 
ment buildings, so I walked right 
to it and swung my weight against 
the door as if I knew where I was 
going. 

I bumped my nose on the news- 
paper clipping tacked to the lock- 
ed door. 



It read in part, Senator J. P. 
Fieldman and his fiften-year-old 
son, Ronald, were kidnapped last 
night from their Washington apart- 
ment, Mrs. Fieldman says that no 
ransom note has reached her. The 
Washington police ...” 

There was a handwritten note 
attached saying that the committee 
meeting was postponed. I must 
have stood staring at the clipping 
for several minutes reading it over 
and over. 

All it said was that they knew 
nothing. Dazed, I wandered back 
to the lobby and sat in my favor- 
ite chair in a tiny alcove almost 
hidden behind a huge potted frond. 
I stared at the oiled leaves and 
thought furiously. 

From my viewpoint, the motive 
was easy — to stop my bill. I’d 
convinced a lot of people of the 
need for the bill, but they wouldn’t 
necessarily stay convinced. Perhaps 
the Opposition believed Senator 
Fieldman’s public stand. Or per- 
haps they wanted time to do some 
counter-lobbying. 

I t didn’t matter; they had stop- 
ped the bill by stopping the 
vote by removing the key figure. 
If they kept him isolated for a 
few days, the committee would elect 
a new chairman and proceed. By 
then, the situation would be less 
favorable to me. 

So the kidnappers would have 
instructions to hold the Senator, 

IF 



106 




probably without hurting him, in 
as unlikely a place as they could 
manage, but not too far from Wash- 
ington so he’d be available. 

Perhaps taking the son was an 
accident, or perhaps they planned 
to release the Senator while hold- 
ing his son to insure co-operation. 

I asked myself over and over, 
''Where wouldn’t the police look?” 
It was two o’clock and I was still 
asking myself when hunger drove 
me to the nearest restaurant. I 
didn’t like eating in Gen restau- 
rants because retainers were re- 
quired; but after six years of school 
cafeterias, I’d learned to handle 
utensils without pinching my lat- 
erals too often. Pain like that spoils 
digestion. 

Naturally, I was shown to a 
corner table. Nobody wants to eat 
with a Sime at the next table. Af- 
ter I’d ordered, the waiter silently 
presented the Sime beverage list 
and I chose Porstan, the vaguely 
sweet Sime beer. To a Gen it tastes 
like iodine. 

I sat back and observed the rest- 
fuUy dim, wood-paneled, carpeted 
room. Each table had an elegant 
white tablecloth that seemed to 
glow in the shadows, reflecting more 
than its fair share of the light 
from the ancient crystal chande- 
lier. Most of the tables were empty 
now, but some were surrounded 
by neatly dressed Washingtonites 
conducting the real business of 
government. 



I watched that waiter. He hadn’t 
spoken a word to me. He’d known 
immediately that I was Sime. 
There was no outward difference 
between us, but he’d known — or 
assumed — simply on the basis of 
my retainers, that I was Sime. 

I ate slowly, mulling that thought 
over, turning it every which way. 
Somehow, it was important, but I 
couldn’t quite see how. That’s the 
way it always was. Why did it at- 
tract my attention now? 

With the last swallow of Porstan, 
it suddenly hit me. 

Suppose, wild as it might sound, 
just suppose a Gen walked in wear- 
ing retainers 1 Every Gen in the 
place would know he was Sime. 
Only another Sime would know dif- 
ferent, provided he was close enough 
to sense the field gradient and was 
not wearing retainers. In one huge 
inductive leap, I knew where they 
had taken Senator FieldmanI 

T made for my car and was on 
the road for the Sime Reserve 
before I’d had time to question the 
validity of induction. 

The Sime Reserve border was 
not guarded by both Simes and 
Gens like Sime Territories. It had 
a Gen military guard only. Any 
Sime covld pass inward without 
challenge, any Gen could pass out- 
ward witJiout challenge. Vice-versa 
you needed papers and counter-sig- 
natures. Any Gen audacious enough 
to snap retainers on his wrists like

107 




medieval gauntlets could pass the 
Gen guards Tvith a breezy wave, just 
as I was doing. A Sime who happen- 
ed to look like Senator Fieldman 
would not be noticed or reported. 

Now, where would they put up? 
In the city itself where no Sime 
wore retainers and no Gen non-Don- 
or was allowed, they’d be discovered 
immediately. As soon as I’d asked 
the question, the answer loomed 
obvious. I turned onto the main 
reserve boulevard, setting myself in 
the through lane in step with the 
traffic lights heading due south. 

There were a couple of hours of 
daylight yet, and I knew where I 
was going. If they were indeed 
there, it would be the interracial 
incident of the century. Gens would 
demand rights of search of Sime 
Territory instead of granting us 
greater freedom. I decided to look 
over the situation and see if I 
couldn’t break it up quietly. 

My destination was an abandon- 
ed copter port built before the de- 
velopment of ground-effect land- 
ing made it reasonable to set a 
chopper down in town. My pilot 
had pointed it out on our way 
down. The Sime Reserve extended 
five miles south of the town to in- 
clude the copter port and, on its 
far side, a wild life preserve and 
picnic area. 

I shot past the field, scarcely 
daring to look for signs of life. At 
the first turnoff under the trees, I 
parked next to a dark blue sedan. 



There were no other cars about, and 
nobody in sight. 

My heart leaped into my throat. 
It could be their car! I wiped my 
palms on my trousers and removed 
my retainers. As far as I could tell, 
I was alone. 

''T^he October foliage was a furi- 
ous riot of color, and the 
early evening breeze was brisk with 
the promise of winter. I took a 
deep breath, buttoned my coat, and 
crept into the forest in the direc- 
tion of the copter field. 

A kind of forboding dread set- 
tled over me as I crept through 
that forest. I hadn’t been so scared 
since I went into the QN-1 place- 
ment test when I was thirteen. The 
placement was designed to strain 
resources, to determine limits. I’d 
had nightmares for six months after. 
I had that same nightmarish feel- 
ing now. 

Finally, I reached a tremendous 
oak and peeped around its gnarled 
trunk at the whitewashed, decrepit 
passenger terminal, square and 
lonely on the cracked concrete 
apron. The starkness of the scene 
was relieved only the the huge poles 
that had held lights and Reeves 
projectors. 

'^This is silly,” I said to my- 
self. ^'You’re being melodramatic. 
Now, take yourself back to the car 
and go talk to the police if you 
think there’s anything in it.” 

By the time I yielded to good 

IF 



108 




sense, it had turned full dark. 
When I noticed that, 1 noticed the 
Gen standing behind me. 

I must have been lost in a revery 
akin to Noadron. 1 had not felt 
him approach, but he was definitely 
a non-Donor. I started to turn 
around. 

^'Hold it I” the man said. have 
a gun primed right in your. back. 
Now march I Right up to the front 
door.” 

I had no choice. I marched. 

Ill 

^T^hey had pitched a tent in the 
waiting room and had camp 
lanterns, a stove and a small heat- 
er going. There was the smell of 
boiled coffee and a staleness of 
onion and garlic. Each of these 
alone was enough to turn my stom- 
ach; together they almost made me 
vomit. 

My captor jabbed the gun bar- 
rel in my back and marched me to 
the dispatcher’s office, a small 
shack in the rear corner. He threw 
a makeshift bolt they had nailed 
to the door and shoved me in with 
the stock of his rifle. 

I sprawled on the floor weakly, 
fighting nausea and the backwash 
of fear. Only when my head stopped 
spinning did I realize I was impris- 
oned with Senator Fieldman and 
his son. 

There was enough moonlight 
through the small duroplast window 

OPERATION HIGH TIME 



to see the boy lying on a blanket 
in one corner and the Senator 
standing by the window staring at 
me. His prematurely bald pate re- 
flected the moonlight, creating a 
halo for his distinguished features. 

”Mr. Farris?!” I’m sure he did 
not know what to think. 

'^Yes, sir.” I got up and brushed 
myself off. 

^mat . ?” 

He was entitled to an explana- 
tion so I told him everything. All 
the time I was talking I was 
nagged by a queer discomfort, but 
didn’t pay much attention. But 
when I’d finished, that prick came 
into sharp focus. I went over to 
the boy, What’s the matter with 
your son?” 

'^Ronald suddenly took sick this 
morning. I think he’s sleeping off a 
fever. These ...” He searched for 
a sufficiently strong term as I 
searched for words to tell him the 
news. ” These criminals won’t pay 
any attention.” 

I bent down and felt Ronald’s 
forearms, extending a lateral 
behind his ear and checking his 
temperature and the field gradi- 
ent. I knew already — it’s an in- 
stinct to recognize it — but I went 
through the motions anyway. 
^Senator, sit down, sir.” 

It was beginning to dawn on 
him. He sat on the floor. There 
was no furniture. 

Ronald is. ” I took a 

109 




breath and started again. ^'Ronald 
is going through changeover.” As 
a QN-1 I’d delivered that news 
hundreds of times, but it had never 
been so hard. 

He just sat there and stared. I 
imagine he felt as if the elevator 
had gone down and left his stomach 
on the fifth floor. He sat perfectly 
still, perfectly silent for about five 
or ten minutes; then he took a deep 
breath and began to sob. 

I gave him a handkerchief, but 
I didn’t touch him. He might have 
misimderstood. He was a noh-Don- 
or. What coxild I say? In a Sime 
family, changeover is a celebra- 
tion. 

At last he blew his nose and said, 
Never before in my family, nev- 
er 1” 

Senator,” I said more to be 
talking than to say anything, 
” thirty percent of the children of 
two Simes are Gens and thirty per- 
cent of the children of two Gens 
are Simes. It’s no respecter of fam- 
ily. Your son is not lost to you. 
He’s growing up. But he’ll always 
be your son. Possibly, if you’re will- 
ing to make some adjustments, he 
may come back to live with you.” 

He heaved a great sigh; he knew 
I meant he’d have to become a 
Donor. It would be a complete 
change of philosophy. Many par- 
ents in this situation still react 
with violent hatred. A generation 
ago, it was common for a Gen par- 
ent to murder his child during the 



first helpless stage of changeover. 
Now, from our educational cam- 
paigns, they generally accept the 
situation. But some who have strong 
anti-Sime feelings, disown the child. 
I was relieved when Fieldman spoke 
with dazed neutrality. 

'^What can we do for him here?” 

I turned to my patient, trying to 
sense the exact stage of his condi- 
tion. ” Would you move back, 
please, sir? I want to check him over 
more carefully.” 

He moved to the far corner of 
the room, and the gradient eased 
off so I could separate out Ron- 
ald’s. I checked the forearms again. 
The tentacles were tiny ropes be- 
neath the skin, so small you had 
to know what to look for. His tem- 
perature was rising; it was almost 
Sime normal, so his hormone bal- 
ance was almost achieved. I check- 
ed the back of his neck, and the Re- 
mott gland was swollen nearly to 
changeover maximum; no wonder 
he was unconscious. He was well 
into Sequence four and so far so 
good, but I could see trouble. 

The life-energy supply he was 
born with woidd run out before his 
laterals would be developed enough 
to receive more. It was a common 
problem with the children of Gens. 
Fear eats life at a stupendous rate. 
Before the QN channels, these chil- 
dren died. Today, a channel backed 
by a Sime hospital could usually 
save them. Practically nobody died 
in changeover these days.

IF 




T was not backed by a Sime hos- 
hospital, but I was supposed 
to be an extraordinary skilled 
channel, a QN-1. Bunk I Without 
certain drugs, there was nothing I 
could do. 

I got up, stuck my hands in my 
pockets and stared at the only door 
to our prison. 

” There are six men out there 
with guns,” Fieldman said, ^'and 
they’re the type who’d use them.” 
'^But they don’t want your son 
to die.” 

'^Die!” 

” Relax. He won’t if I can help 
it.” I pounded the door trying to 
sound imperious and humble. 

Presendy, a gruff voice, full of 
gravel ... or maybe buckshot . 
said, ”What ^cha want?” 

said, We’ve got a very sick 
boy in here. He’ll die without med- 
ical aid. I’m a doctor, I can save 
him, but I need a few things.” 
'^Yeah? Like what?” 

"Extra blankets. He’s got a high 
fever. And some medicines. In my 
car, in the glove compartment, 
there’s a flat metal case. It has 
everything I need except water.” 
"And you want us to let you go 
get your case and whatever Sime 
weapons is in it? You think we’re 
nuts?” 

"The car is unlocked. Get the 
case yourself. Don’t try to open it, 
though. I’ll open it for you. It’s 
life-locked and you’d only destroy 
the contents.” 

;i2 



"Huh. WeU, I’ll think about it.” 

He left, and I laid my jacket 
and coat over the boy. Fieldman 
shook his head and started to take 
off his coat. 

"No, no, sir,” I said. "Don’t. It 
isn’t necessary. I can keep warm 
other ways.” 

He understood I meant by using 
my stored life-energy. As a chan- 
nel, I always carried far more than 
I needed just to stay alive. I was 
entrusted with public property, to 
be dispensed to Simes in need, and 
to be used in the public interest. 

1 took to staring out the window. 
After a while, I noticed Fieldman 
kneeling quietly by his son, hold- 
ing his hand and rocking back and 
forth. I hated to do it, but I had 
to. I said, "Sir, don’t go near him. 
You’re very high field, and it only 
makes matters worse.” 

I t must have been almost two 
hours later that I heard the 
bolt of the door slide. 

"O.K. Sime, come on out of there. 
Make it slow.” 

Gravel voice was back. There was 
a slight glow from the tent, but 
I’m sure it wasn’t visible from out- 
side. Three men were silhouetted 
against that glow, their faces pale in 
the moonlight from the observa- 
tion windows. They were all Gen 
non-Donors, wearing mismatched 
hiking clothes and knee-high boots 
and pointing rifles at me. 

"Into the tent.” Gravel voice 

IF 




gestured, and they closed in behind 
me. 

A fourth man hulked over a small 
table illuminated by a suspended 
lantern. He was at least a head 
taller than the others and maybe 
fifty poimds heavier. The tent held 
six cots and a couple of stools. The 
emergency kit from the car lay on 
the table. 

There’s your miracle box, ‘Doc- 
tor.’ Open it!” said the big one. 

His voice was about two octaves 
higher than expected from a man 
that size. He shoved it at me and 
moved back, obviously taking no 
chances. 

I thumbed it open. As I had ex- 
pected, it was almost the standard 
kit containing the thirty-six chem- 
icals used to aid changeover — 
pills, liquid and aromatics. 

‘‘As you can see, it contains 
nothing but medicines,” I said as 
steadily as I could. 

“Sime medicines I How’s that and 
a Sime doctor going to help him?” 

“I’m a ^me doctor, but I’ve had 
some training in Gen medicine.” I 
wasn’t going to admit that Ronald 
was one of us. “In addition to 
this. I’ll need extra blankets, and, 
in the morning some boiling water,” 

The big one seemed to be the 
boss. He sat there and squinted 
at me for an eternity before flick- 
ing a finger at gravel voice, who 
picked up a bundle from the near- 
est cot while the others prodded 
me out the door. 



The moonlight had shifted, and 
this time I spotted the rest room 
sign. “Hey,” I said to gravel voice, 
“Does that work, or do we go find 
a tree?” 

“It works . You get a turn in 
the morning.” 

The rest of the way back, I 
wondered what would happen if I 
insisted on taking a turn right 
now. 

I found Fieldman pacing anxiously 
across the far end of the room 
from his son. Retrieving my coat, 
I covered the boy with the extra 
blankets and started him on an 
aromatic sedative. He gave a few 
tosses of the head and then relaxed 
completely. 

“He’s sleeping now, sir, the way 
he needs to sleep. In the morning, 
you’ll tell him that you accept him, 
that you still love him and you’ll 
give him courage.” I held my breath 
waiting for his commitment. 

“Yes, yes, I can do that. At 
least that. I . ” 

Relieved, I said, “In the mean- 
time, we ought to try to help our- 
selves out of this situation.” 
“There’s no way out,” Fieldman 
gave a hopeless little shrug. “I’ve 
tried everything. The window does 
not break, the floor’s cement, the 
guards are un-trickable.” 

“Of course the building is strong. 
It was deigned to protect people 
from a crashing helicopter. But 
there must be some way ...”

we wait long enough, we’ll be 
found ...” 

^^We can’t wait. By tomorrow 
afternoon Ronald’s condition will be 
obvious, even to them. If they be- 
lieve that this will bind you to the 
Sime viewpoint, they may kill us 
and run.” 

”What do you propose to do?” 
don’t know. I must admit 
I’m embarrassed. A Sime trapped in 
a Sime building in Sime territority 
by Gens. Most embarrassing.” 

Through our tiny window, I 
studied the landing apron and its 
border of undisciplined forest which 
one day would obliterate this relic 
of modern civilization as it had 
countless pre-Sime structures. My 
mind whirled like the vanes of an 
idling copter, throwing up five or 
six plans to arouse my eagerness to 
be away from here, free to take 
my patient to the facilities he real- 
ly needed. 

And, like a Judo expert, I used 
that figurative centrifugal force to 
rid myself of those plans because 
each one involved newly discovered 
QN-1 abilities. I could not betray 
our secrets to the Gens merely to 
save a few lives. Any premature 
hint of these superior or odd tal- 
ents of Simes would only be fuel 
for the anti-Simes who would burn 
us at the stake. 

Presently, the Senator said very 
quietly, ”A man whose touch can 
doesn’t need a gun ...” 

^'Senator 1” I whirled on him tru- 



ly shocked. That hadn’t occurred to 
me. Every Sime is pledged to die 
by attrition or suicide rather than 
kill in transfer. That’s what I’ve 
been telling you for weeks. This is 
no longer the dark ages. Gens can 
trust Simes. What use is life with- 
out stable society?” 

After a long pause he said very 
faintly, ^Tt was only a thought.” 

T returned to staring out the win- 
dow. Moonlight glinted off the 
tops of the light standards. For the 
first time, I noticed the Reeves 
projector casings humped at the 
tops of the poles like frightened 
monkies. 

I said, ^Tsn’t it strange that the 
toilets were left operative?” 

Fieldman looked at me a moment, 
then shrugged accepting the odd- 
ment, ^Terhaps they turned them 
on?” 

^Terhaps,” I said searching the 
room with renewed interest. ^'And 
then again, perhaps not.” 

How had the dispatcher’s furni- 
ture been placed? The chart table 
at that end where Ronald now lay, 
atlas case, radiophone, and the dis- 
patcher’s desk in this corner oppo- 
site the door. I ran my hand down 
the join in the walls. 

The Reeves control box was 
mounted to be reached from the 
desk, life-locked, about as big as 
my hand. 

Not daring to hope, not daring 
to think, I opened the box and 

IF 



114 




threw the switch. A surge of power 1 
Somewhere charged life-batteries 
still fed the projectors. 

"They workl” 

"What work?” 

"The Reeves projectors.” 

"Fine. What are Reeves projec- 
tors?” 

"Standard markers used ta sup- 
plement lights by creating an in- 
terference pattern any Sim can 
sense. They take hours to warm 
up, but with any luck, they may be 
noticed by tomorrow noon. When a 
field’s in use, they’re kept warm on 
standby, but these were turned 
completely off. Odd they weren’t 
removed, but very lucky for us.” 
"Now all we have to do is sur- 
vive until tomorrow afternoon.” 
"And to do that we better get 
some rest.” 

"I couldn’t sleep.” 

T7ven without examining the deep- 
ening circles about his eyes I 
could sense the fatigue in him. "Sir, 
tomorrow is going to be a very hard 
day. You’ll need all your faculties, 
you really must* sleep, at least a 
few hours.” I hesitated a couple of 
breaths and then decided, "If you 
wish, I could help you sleep ...” 
Instantly, I regretted it. He gasp- 
ed and stiffened in panic. Simes are 
ultrasensitive to a Gen’s fear and 
react with instinctive aggressive- 
ness. I suppressed my animal re- 
sponse with gritted teeth and 
clenched fists, and tried to calm 



him, "Senator, I won’t touch you 
without your permission . ever.” 
Then suddenly it was over. He 
said, "Yes, there’s no time like now. 
If only for Ronald’s sake . 
what do I do?” 

Arranging a couple of blankets 
in the farthest, corner from Ron- 
old, I said, "Lie down here, push 
your sleeves up and try to relax.” 
I sat on a blanket on his left 
side and began to talk softly, 
"Now, this will work only if you 
co-operate. Listen to my voice, re- 
lax, think very hard about sun- 
rise. You don’t want to know any- 
thing until sunrise when the light 
will awaken you. I’m going to 
touch you, lightly just with my 
hand.” 

I brushed the palms of his hands. 
"Now, I’ve got an accurate read- 
ing, I’m going to even the field 
gradient. Relax, don’t pull away, 
just lie still. You won’t feel a 
thing; next you know it will be 
dawn and you will wake refreshed. 

I leaned forward and made wrist 
contact with my laterals. Then I 
brushed his lips with mine ever so 
gently for the instant of transfer 
and made time sense adjustment so 
he would sleep. 

It was his first, so I only took 
the first level of his life-store. He 
was a General class Donor new. 

I bedded down next to my pa- 
tient, linked to be roused instant- 
ly by any minor change in his 
condition.

T woke to pre-dawn grayness and 
checked Ronald over. Now he 
needed exercise. When I waved a 
second aromatic under his nose, he 
stirred restlessly. Then I sat him 
up, supporting him against my 
chest as I chose a* small vial of 
liquid. 

'^Ronny, Ronny, I^m your friend 
Ronny, I^m going to help you feel 
bettw. He looked at me, bleary- 
efred, with changeover’s instinctive 
hostility, the withdrawal, the need 
for total privacy during this vul- 
nerable phase warring openly with 
tfie docile suggestivity induced by 
Bqfr drugs. ''Here, drink this down. 
It will clear your head. I know you 
don’t want to swallow, but this 
won’t upset your stomach.” 

The drugs prevailed, and he drank. 
While we huddled together, wait- 
ing for it to take effect, his father 
woke. Ronald had buried his face 
in my shoulder and was breathing 
heavily to the waves of sensation 
from the drugs and from his condi- 
tion. I motioned his father to be 
still and waited. 

Finally, Ronald drew a shudder- 
ing sigh and looked up to my face, 
down at my arms, and then shrank 
away in trained reflex. 

Our eyes met. I said, "You too, 
you know?” 

Hesitantly, he nodded. 

"Ronald.” I took his hands. 
"Don’t fight it any more. Your life 



depends on that. I can help you 
only if you relax and accept it. 
You do what I say and you’ll live. 
I promise.” 

I montioned his father over. 
"Talk to him a while.” And I 
went to the window to give them 
privacy. 

The Reeves projectors were draw- 
ing power, but I knew they were 
still imperceptible. The building 
was insulated, so I woiddn’t know 
when they established a pattern, 
but I could guess. 

Suddenly, my stomach remember- 
ed it hadn’t had any dinner and 
only a light lunch yesterday. I 
pounded on the door and kicked 
it imtil gravel voice husked sleepi- 
ly, ‘‘What ’cha want?” 

"Breakfast, and that pot of hot 
water. Or are we to be starved to 
death?” 

It was a crude jibe. Simes always 
fed their prisoners well. But it was 
effective. Half an hour later we re- 
ceived boiled eggs, bread, cheese, 
milk, coffee and a pot of hot wa- 
ter. 

T sent the Senator to eat while I 
poured some of the hot water 
in a cup, added a powder from the 
emergency kit and took it to Ron- 
ald. I turned him to the corner 
and sat in front of him, taking out 
my other handkerchief. 

"This is going to be painful, but 
it’s necessary. I fear, you’ve used 
too much life-energy. So you’ll re- 

IF 



116 




quire more before your laterals are 
fully developed. If I weren^t here, 
that would be deadly. But I am 
here. And I’m a QN-1. I can force 
a transfer to you with a minimum 
development of your tentacles, but 
I need at least that minimum. 

"This is old-fashioned and very 
crude, but effective.” I dipped the 
handkerchief in the steaming wa- 
ter and applied it to his forearms. 
He bore that torture with staid 
courage until, finally, I wiped the 
tears of pain from his eyes. 

Then I tested the brew I had 
prepared and made him drink it 
all. It was pure nourishment in a 
form his disturbed metabolism 
could accept. 

I spent the rest of the morning 
alternately walking Ronald around 
the room and instructing him in the 
channel’s transfer technique. Gen- 
Sime transfer is instinctive, but 
Sime-Sime transfer has to be learn- 
ed. 

With lunch, I demanded more 
hot water and got it without com- 
ment. Surprisingly, our captors did 
not look in on us more often. I 
stippose they depended on the out- 
side guards. I knew that at this 
time of year only the rangers and 
the border police used this road, 
so I didn’t care to calculate the 
probability of the right man notic- 
ing the Reeves’ field and reacting 
the right way. 

About mid-afternoon, I began 
routine sedation for Ronald’s first 



transfer, an effective tranquilizer 
that would nevertheless sharpen his 
new senses. It was getting dark 
when I could put it off no longer. 

I engaged the life-lock on the 
door to insure our privacy, "Sir I’m 
going to ask you to stay back in 
the corner again. The less inter- 
ference the better. ” 

"He’s going to be all right?” 
"Definitely. But this is the criti- 
cal point.” 

'^hat was more confidence than 
^ I felt. I’d never done it outside 
a hospital before. Nothing is quite 
like your first field test. Remind- 
ing myself that I was far over- 
qualified for this simple job, and 
that any QN-3 could have done it, 
I worked through the routine very 
slowly, talking the half-conscious 
boy into confidence, reminding him 
of what I’d taught him that morn- 
ing, and slowly building a tre- 
mendous field gradient between us. 
I watched for his first instinctive 
reaching toward the apex of that 
gradient, the sign that I really had 
my ‘minimal development.’ 

I got it after two heartstopping 
minutes, made contact, gave him 
enough to see him through to full 
development, and withdrew. 

Just in time, too. I sensed some- 
body at our door. Ha'I^tily, I dis- 
engaged the life-lock and tried to 
pull myself together. After that op- 
eration, I needed about five minutes 
to return to normal.

It was only our dinner, the same 
un-insptring fare. And another 
pot of hot water . unasked. 

” How’s the kid?” gravel voice 
inquired. 

''Sleeping. I think he’ll be fine.” 
Gravel voice looked me up and 
down once, very slowly, "Yeah... 
he better be.” I was afraid he’d 
look for himself, but he left with 
only a glance at the heap of blan- 
kets in ' the comer. Perhaps he 
thought it was contageous. 

I sat down, poured myself a cup 
of hot water, added a little some- 
thing from the emergency kit, and 
drank it all. It helped. I stopped 
shaking. 

Then, I noticed Fieldman. I pour- 
ed another cup of water and added 
a mild Gen sedative from the be- 
ginning of the sequence. I’d been 
treating Ronald from the middle of 
the array and I’d taken mine from 
the end. "Doctor Farris prescribes.” 
I offered him the cup. 

He hesitated. I smiled. "Come on, 
sir, this is good for you.” 

With a sigh, he sat beside me 
and took the cup. "Rescue’s late.” 
"Not too. I think we’re safe un- 
til morning. I don’t know about 
you, but I’ve had a day. I’m going 
to sleep.” 

"How can you sleep?” 

"I don’t know, but I’ll manage.” 

T woke to the sound of rifle fire. 

The Senator stood by the win- 
dow, moonlight splashjng the floor 



around his shadow. Ronald was 
soundly unconscious. 

"Rescue?” I asked 
"I think so. I think they’re try- 
ing to get away.” 

I joined him to watch for the 
sporadic flashes among the trees. 
Presently, it tapered off and ceased. 
Fifteen minutes later the bolt slid, 
and the door opened. 

Grandpa Digen stood there lean- 
ing on his cane and chuckling. 

Four days later. Grandpa and I 
sat on our porch watching the sun- 
set. 

"So they finally rounded up all 
the people responsible as well as 
the kidnappers themselves. Credited 
solely to the Sime police. And you 
have got yourself a Senator for a 
friend. What more do you want?” 
"What did you mean about Izak? 
Did he have me followed? I don’t 
want someone snooping on me.” 
"Hahl No, he didn’t have you 
followed. He has more savvy than 
you’ll ever know. When you didn’t 
check back, he got worried and 
started worrying others. If you’d 
thought to turn on the Reeves soon- 
er, we’d have got there sooner.” 
“Well ...” You can’t argue 
with Grandpa, so I changed the 
subject, "We got the bill out of 
committee, recommended for pass- 
ing. So where do we go from here?” 
This set him to wheezing and 
chugkling and mumbling. " Got my- 
self a real trooper for a grandson!”

IN THE SHIELD 

by DEAN R. KOONTZ 

Illustrated by REESE 



There were three to shape destiny 
with the Shield's ancient Prisoner: 
a Poet; a Mue; and — perhaps — a Man. 



I 

'lichen he woke from a feature- 
less dream of silver, there 
was nothing but endless black- 
ness on three sides, a blackness so 
intense that it almost coughed 
out a breath and moved. And when 



he woke, he did not know who he 
was. 

The control console’s flashing 
told him that this was a spaceship 
imder and behind him. That ex- 
plained the darkness through the 
viewplate of the guidance nipple. 
And his misty reflection in the 



119 




thick plastiglass told him he was a 
man, for he had the blue eyes 
of a man and the face of a man, 
severe but handsome, topped by a 
dangle of coal-dusted hair. But 
these things were general. When 
he tried to concentrate on specif- 
ics, but there were no answers. 

Who was he ? 

What had been his past? 

And where was he bound? 

He could remember that this 
was the year 3456, and he knew 
all about the society it had, or 
a good deal of it, anyway. Yet his 
personal history was a blank. He 
got up, walked behind the chair, 
away from the viewplate and to- 
ward the rear of the chamber. A 
quick search of the gray chamber 
showed that there were no writ- 
ten logs. The logtapes only roared 
and screeched when he turned 
them on. 

When he turned them off, the 
sOence was even more penetrating. 

He tugged at the circular wall 
hatch at the fear of the chamber, 
swung it inward. Beyond lay a 
corridor, narrow and low ceiling- 
ed. At the end of it, he knew, lay 
a room of shielding before the 
drive chamber. Along the sides 
were two rooms that he could en- 
ter without being burned to cin- 
ders by hard radiation. 

In the room to the right, there 
was a complete laboratory with 
roho-surgeons hanging from the 
ceiling like bloated spiders. Di- 
120 



rectly under the machine doctors 
was an operating table with a 
flexo-plast mattress that clutched 
a patient firmly and held him as 
if it were alive. He shuddered and 
walked into the haU. He did not 
entirely 'trust machines like that 
— machines that were so much 
like men but had neither mercies 
nor faults of men. 

Across the corridor, the other 
room was an armory. Crates of 
construction explosives sat on the 
floor, enough tp level a city. There 
were racks of guns on the wall. 
Vaguely, he knew there were no 
guns in the world any more. Men 
of this age did not kill anything 
but game animals. Guns were 
mainly for collecting. But these 
were too new for collecting, and 
deep within him he knew he pos- 
sessed the ability to use each of 
them. Against the far wall and 
next to the cargo portal, a groimd 
car with broadcasting nubs stud- 
ding it. With its invincible shield 
turned on, it was, in effect, an- 
other weapon. 

There was something bothering 
him, something more than the 
mere presence of weapons. Then, 
as he gazed at the ground car, 
he knew what it was. Nothing here 
carried a tradename I The car was 
void of brand, model and make. 
So were the rifles and the throw- 
ing knives and the explosives. 
These things had been produced 
to provide anonymity. But who 

IP 




made them? And for what pur- 
pose? 

Bong-bong-bong! 

A t first, he ignored the ship’s 
alarm, trying to think. But 
the ship grew more insistent. He 
put back a rifle he had been ex- 
amining and left for the control 
room. 

UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT AP- 
PROACHING. CLARIFICATION 
IN THIRTY SECONDS. The 
computer’s squawkbox grated the 
words out much like sandpaper be- 
ing drawn across sandpaper. CLAR- 
IFICATION. IT IS A MAN. 

'^A man? Out here without a 
ship?” 

THERE IS A HEARTBEAT. 

Like a grotesquely misshapen 
fruit, the body in the red suit float- 
ed in the blackness, directionless, 
moving with a slight spin that 
brought all sides of it into view. 

UNCONSCIOUS. 

He brought the ship in as close 
35 possible, studied the crimson 
figure. What was a man doing this 
far from a ship, alone, in a suit 
that could not support him for more 
than twelve hours? ^T’m going to 
have him brought in,” he said to 
the ship. 

DO YOU THINK YOU 
SHOULD? 

He’ll die out there!” 

The ship was silent. 

Like small animals, his fingers 
moved. A moment later, the cylin- 
IN THE SHIELD 



drical body of the Scavenger ap- 
peared in the viewplate. It was an- 
other almost-alive machine. He 
shivered. The single eye of the 
Scavenger focused on the body. On 
the console screen, there was a 
closeup of the stranger. Then the 
lens caught the face inside the hel- 
met, and he was no longer so sure 
it was a man. 

There was a face with two eyes 
but no eyebrows. Where the brows 
should have been, there were two 
bony ridges, hard and dark and 
glistening. A mane of brown hair 
streaked with white lay as a cushion 
about the head. The mouth was 
wide and generous, but not the 
mouth of a man. The lips were a 
bit too red, and the teeth that stugk 
over them at two places were sharp, 
pointed, and very white. Still, it 
was more of a man than an animal. 
There was a look about the face 
that suggested soul-tortured agony, 
and that was very human. He di- 
rected the Scavenger to begin re- 
trieval. 

When the Scavenger was locked in- 
to place, he opened the floor hatch, 
drew up the body, and carefully 
unsuited it. The helmet bore the 
stenciled name HURKOS . 

e was in a great cathedral. The 
red tongues of candles flicker- 
ed in their silver holders, 

Belina was dead. No one died 
anymore, but Belina was dead, A 
rare case. The monster in her womb

had slashed her apart. Nothing the 
doctors cotdd do. When you can*t 
turn to blame other men, there is 
only one entity to blame: God, It 
was difficult finding a temple, for 
there were not many faithftd these 
days. But he had found one now, 
complete with its holy water taint- 
ed with sacrificial blood and its 
handful of ancient Christians — an- 
cient because they refused the man- 
made immortality of the Eternity 
Combine: they grew old. 

He was in the great cathedral, 
climbing the altar railing and 
clutching the feet of the great cru- 
cifix, On the kneecap, slipping . , . 
Grasping at the loincloth, pulling 
himself up, weeping A foot in 
the navel, shoving up . Screaming 
into the ear. But the ear, after all, 
was wooden. Rocking, swaying the 
giant monument. Finally, he top- 
pled it ,, , and pushed away from 
it as it fell , , , 

There were sirens, and hospital 
attendants. 

The last thing he remembered 
seeing was an old man, a Christian, 
cradled between the broken halves 
of God*s face, mumbling and con- 
tent with his sanctuary , , , 

TTe pulled himself away from 
^ ^ Hurkos, shook his head. This 
was the stranger’s dream. How had 
he experienced it? 

Hurkos opened his eyes. They 
were chunks of polished coal, dark 
jewels threatening many secrets. 



His mouth was very dry, and 
when he tried to speak, the cor- 
ners of his lips cracked and spilled 
blood. The nameless man brought 
water. 

”It didn’t work then,” Hurkos 
had a voice deep and commanding. 

^^What didn’t work? What were 
you doing out there?” 

Hurkos smiled. “Trying to kill 
myself.” 

“Suicide?” 

“They call it that.” He sipped 
more water. 

“Because Belina died?” 

Hurkos bristled. “How could you 
know — ” After a moment, he nod- 
ded. “I guess I told you.” 

“Yes. How could I hear your 
dreams like that?” 

Hurkos looked puzzled for a mo- 
ment. “I’m a telepath, of course. 
Sometimes I project, some rare 
times I read thoughts. Unstable tal- 
ent. I project mostly when I’m 
asleep — or under pressure.” 

“But how did you get out there 
without a ship?” 

“After I was released from the 
hospital — after Belina’s death and 
the crucifix incident — I signed on 
the Space Razzle as a cargo han- 
dler. When we were in relatively 
untraveled space, I went into the 
hold, disconnected the alarms from 
the pressure chamber, and left. I 
won’t be missed imtil pay day.” 
“But why not step out without 
a suit? That would be quicker.” 
Hurkos smiled an unsmile. “I

guess a little of the healing did take 
hold. I guess we can recover from 
anything.” But he did not look re- 
covered. Right now, my talent 
is fading. I can’t see a name in 
your mind.” 

The other hesitated. ''You can’t 
see a name . because I have 
none.” 

Briefly, he recounted his sad 
story, the amnesia and the strange- 
ness of the ship. 

Hurkos seemed interested. Here 
was something to submerge his mel- 
ancholia. 

“We are going to make a 
real search of this tub, you and me. 
But first, you ought to have a 
name.” 

“What?” 

“How about — Sam? After a 
friend of mine.” 

“I like it. Who was this mar- 
velous friend?” 

“A dog I bought in Galileo.” 

“Thanks!” 

“He was noble.” 

With the preliminaries out of the 
way, Sam could no longer contain 
his curiosity. “We both have names 
now. We know I am a man — but 
what are you** 

Hurkos looked startled. "You 
don’t know what a Mue is?” 

“No. I guess maybe I have been 
gone too long. Maybe I left before 
there were Mues.” 

“Then you left a thousand years 
ago — and you want danm far 
away!” 



TJurkos padded down the corri- 
^ dor and into the main cham- 
ber. “Absolutdy nothing!” 

They had been searching for six 
hours and still had no clue to Sam’s 
or the ship’s origin. Hurkos had 
manged, somehow, to fill him in on 
Mue history. Once, well over a 
thousand years before, man had 
tried to make other men with the 
help of the Artificial Wombs. After 
hundreds of attempts, nothing very 
worthwhile had come of it. They 
had been tr3dng to produce men of 
psionic abilities valuable as weap- 
ons of war. Sometimes, they came 
close. Never did they have complete 
success. Then, when the project 
was finally junked, they had five 
hundred mutated children on their 
hands. This was at the time when 
mankind was laying aside weapons 
for plowshares. Most looked upon 
the Wombs as a hideous arm of the 
recent war efforts, and they looked 
upon the Mue diildren with pity 
and shame. There was a great 
public outcry when the government 
hinted that the Mues might be 
"put to sleep.” They were allowed 
to live. In fifteen years, they had 
equality. They mated, had more 
of their own kind, but often produc- 
ed normal children. Today, there 
were fourteen million of them — 
only a fifth of one per cent of ga- 
lactic population. Fourteen million. 
And Sam could not ever remember

having heard anything b£ them. 
'' Food's about ready, ^ lii said. 

' Smells good/’ Hurkos rqdied as 
the trays slid from png dot. 

They sat on the floor tg iafi ^^^It's 
damn eerie, Hurkod muttered 
around a mouthful of synlHe-beef. 
"There should be at least one brand 
name. He paused, swallowed, then 
said, "The food! 

Sam waved him down. "I al- 
ready looked. The food basics below 
the synthesizer are in unmarked 
containers." 

They made a list of their known 
facts and found it small. They pon- 
dered over it as they ate. "What's 
the matter?" Hurkos asked a few 
moments later. "You hardly ate a 
thing." 

Sam grimaced, waved a hand 
vaguely, let it fall into his lap. 
"I'm sort of afraid to eat, be- 
cause — " 

"Go on!" 

"Because it has been made by 
machines. The food isn't natural." 

Hurkos swallowed. "That's an- 
other piece of data. You're afraid 
of machines. I thought so earlier — 
judging by your reaction to the ro- 
bo-surgeons. 

"But I could starve!" 

"I doubt it. You ate enough to 
keep you going. You just won't 
get fat." 

S am opened his mouth to speak . 

. and felt lightning sear his 
brain. Thunders crashed. Chaos 



swirled. He pushed from the floor, 
found his seat, strapped in, unable 
to control his actions. 

Hurkos was beside him, shout- 
ing. But he could not hear the Mue. 
Something had a fist around his 
mind, and his world was a world of 
thunders. He slammed toggles. 

Behind the command chair, Hur- 
kos wrapped himself in the flexo- 
plast mattress they had removed 
from the surgeon's table. There was 
no second seat in the ship, and the 
resiliant living foam was an ade- 
quate replacement. He was almost 
into it. 

Sam slammed the ship into hyper- 
space . and they collided with 
something . 

The thunders were gone, and he 
was in control of himself. Hurkos 
was rolling all over the floor, bounc- 
ing off the walls as the ship wal- 
lowed from the impact. Sam reach- 
ed the viewplate, saw another ship 
hanging only a mile away. The 
collision had jolted them back into 
real space. He tried for radio con- 
tact but got no response. 

"What the Hell were you doing?" 
Hurkos shouted, freeing himself 
from the mattress and staggering to 
his feet. 

"I don't know! Someone took 
over my body, told me to set a 
course for Hope — 

"The capital?" 

"Yes. I can't argue." 

Hurkos rubbed a bruise on his 
arm. "Recognize the voice?" 



124 



IF 




wasn’t exactly a voice. It 
was more like — ” 

There was a sudden pounding 
noise. They whirled toward the 
viewplate and saw a giant poimding 
on the plastiglass. '"Open up and 
leave me ini” He had his helmet 
pressed to the viewplate and was 
threatening to tear the ship apart 
if they didn’t open up. He looked 
as if he just might be able to carry 
out the threat. They let him in. 

Tf the stranger from the other 
ship had been an imposing fig- 
ure seen through the viewplate, he 
was overwhelming seen at first 
hand. Six-foot-six if an inch, two 
hundred and seventy pounds if an 
ounce. He pulled Ms helmet off, 
spewing a stream of vivid curses. 
His blond, unruly hair fell into blue 
eyes like sky chips. ^^What the devil 
are you, some sort of moron? Mo- 
rons have been bred out of the cul- 
ture I You’re the last living moron, 
and I have to — ” 

guess you’re angry about the 
collision,” Sam began, ^^and — ” 
^^You guess I’m angry about the 
collision I You guess I” He paused, 
let his jaw drop, picked it up with- 
out losing his expression of disbe- 
lief, and continued ^^Of course I’m 
angry about the collision! You hy- 
perspaced without checking to 
see if there was another ship in 
hyperspace within the danger limit. 
Your field locked with mine and 
jolted both of us into real space. 



What if our ships had collided in- 
stead of just our fields?” 

'^That’s rather imlikely,” Hurkos 
said. ''After all, the fields are five 
miles in diameter, but our ships 
are a tiny fraction of that. The 
odds — ” 

"A moron spewing logic!” The 
big man struck his forehead with 
a palm. 

"If you’d just listen for — ” 

"I’m listening! I’m all ears! I 
want to hear your excuses for — ” 

"Wait a minute!” Hurkos shout- 
ed suddenly, his eyes bright. "I 
know you! Mikos. You’re Gnossos 
Mikos — the poet!” 

The rage was swept off the face 
by a smile. The huge hand came 
forth to be shaken. "And I have 
not had the pleasure,” the giant 
said politely. 

Hurkos shook the hand vigorous- 

ly- 

Relief swept through Sam’s 
frame. He wanted to fold up his 
legs, tuck them under his belly, 
and fall onto his face. He fought it. 

"My name is Hurkos. A nobody, 
but I love your poetry. Especially 
The Savagery of Old! 

** *Spill the blood across the 
savage face, 

Raise the axe, the bow, the gun, 
the mace — ’ ” 

Gnossos finished the quatrain: 



IN THE SHIELD 



" 'Scream the scream that breaks 




apart the chest; 

Killing man is what you know the 

bestr^ 

”Hummpphhl” Sam managed to 
say. 

'^Oh! Mr. Mikos, this — ” 

^^Gnossos,” the poet interrupted. 

Hurkos beamed. /'Gnossos, this 
is Sam.” 

The giant engulfed Sam’s hand 
in his giant paw. ^^Glad to meet 
you. Now what malfunction of your 
vessel caused this recent unpleasant- 
ry?” 

T ater, after the poet had heard 
^ the entire story of the amnesia 
and strange voices in Sam’s head, 
he rubbed his hands together, and 
said, ^^What a mysteryl You won’t 
get rid of me until we solve it!” 

^^Then yoii aren’t angry?” 

Angry. But whatever for?” 

Sam sighed. 

'^WeU,” Hurkos said, ^^what do 
you make of it?” He hunched for- 
ward like a small boy at his father’s 
knee. 

Gnossos rolled his tongue over 
his wide, perfect teeth, thought a 
moment. ^Tt sounds,” he said at 
length, ^'as if someone is trying to 
over-turn the galaxy.” 

Sam shifted, waited for more, 
shifted when the poet didn’t speak. 
”What do you mean?” Hurkos 
asked. 

'Consider the weapons. Weap- 
ons have been illegal — except for 
126 



sport and collecting — for over 
a thousand years. You say these 
are obviously not for sport because 
of their design and power, yet no 
one collects explosives or new guns. 
Someone, it seems, plans to use 
them on humans.” 

Sam and Hurkos exchanged 
looks. This was a fear they had not 
voiced. 

^^The tradenames,” Gnossos con- 
tinued, ^'are missing because the 
owner of all this wants his part 
kept secret. Sam is a tool, a tool 
being used to overthrow the cur- 
rent order of things.” 

"Then at any moment he might 
get orders to kill us because we 
know too much!” 

Sam was perspiring . 

"No,” the poet said. "The order 
to hyperspace sounds as if it was 
post-hypnotic.” He waited for 
them to register relief. "Sam was 
kidnapped, and his memory was 
wiped out. Then they — whoever 
They may be — implanted a series 
of hypnotic commands. When that 
was done, they shipped him off to 
do whatever they commanded. Per- 
haps the first order was designed 
to be triggered by the first meal 
he ate. The remaining commands 
may now be geared to a time se- 
quence — regular or irregular inter- 
vals between each.” 

"So whatever gave him the or- 
ders would not be aware of our 
presence.” 

"Correct.” 



IF 




S am wiped his forehead dry. 

'^Good. I like both of you too 
much to kill you.” 

One thing,” Gnossos said. ”Why 
didn^t you acknowledge my radio 
message just after the collision?” 
'^We didn’t receive any,” Sam 
answered perplexed. ^^We tried to 
reach you but got no answer.” 

” Broken radio?” Hurkos asked. 
Sam went and checked the con- 
trol console. 

WORKING PROPERLY. 

''That shoots one theory. But 
how could Sam’s secret master get 
control of the radio if all his com- 
mands are post-hypnotic?” 

Gnossos shrugged, stood. "Maybe 
they do know we are here. Maybe 
they’re just waiting for the right 
moment to knock us off. We’ll 
have to wait and see. Right now, 
let’s check your laboratory. I have 
an idea.” 

The three of them went below 
to the robo^surgeons. "Someone 
could have machined the cases for 
these,” Gnossos said, "but there are 
only a few companies that have the 
facilities to produce the interiors. 
Whoever put this together would 
have to use factory-made parts.” 
Sam flicked the control knob, 
lowered the spider-like, many-arm- 
ed machine, rotated it so that the 
access plate of the main component 
faced them. Gnossos rubbed his 
palms together. "Now we’ll see if 
we can find a few clues.” 

He threw back the latches that 



held the plate on, dropped the cov- 
er to the floor. "Every company 
keeps a list of purchasers. One se- 
rial number, and we can find this 
tub’s owner.” He bent over and 
peered into the darkness of the 
globe’s interior. He looked puz- 
zled. 

"Awful dark in there,” Hurkos 
said. 

Gnossos put a hand inside, reach- 
ed in, up to his elbow. 

"There’s nothing in it I” Sam 
said. 

"Oh yes there is! ” Gnossos shout- 
ed. "And it has hold of my hand!” 

HI 

gnossos tore his hand from the 
machine, rubbed it against his 
chest. It was red and bleeding in a 
few spots. 

"What the Hell is in there?” 
Hurkos asked. 

Sam stifled a low-key scream 
that began slithering up his throat. 

As if in answer to Hurkos’s 
question, a jelly-mass began drip- 
ping from the open plating onto 
the table. It collected there, amber 
spotted with areas of bright or- 
ange. It trembled, quivered. There 
was a skin forming over it, the am- 
ber and orange changing to a pink- 
ish-tan hue that made it look a 
great deal like human flesh — too 
much like human flesh. The skin 
expanded, contracted, and there 
were pseudopods pulling the mass 



IN THE SHIELD 



127 




across the table toward the warmth 
of their bodies. 

They had backed nearly to the 
door. ^'The machine had no in- 
sides!” Gnossus said, rubbing his 
wounds. 

^^But it moved,” Sam said. 
operated like a machine. How could 
it do that without moving parts?” 
^^That — that thing was its in- 
sides, its working parts, Gnossus 
said. '^That jelly-mass operated the 
shell like a machine.” 

The last of the mass dropped 
from the bowl of the main segment. 
There was more there than could 
have been contained in the main 
sphere; obviously, all the sections 
had been filled and were now drain- 
ed and empty. The jelly-mass, 



shapeless, plunged over the end of 
the table, struck the floor with a 
sickening squashing sound, and 
rolled toward them, arms of simu- 
lated flesh lashing out for pur- 
chase on the cold floor. 

^^The armory!” Sam shouted, 
turning into the hall and flinging 
the door to the other room wide. 
Perhaps it had been the hypnotic 
training with the weapons that 
made him think of the armory. 
He knew how to kill; he could stop 
the amobea, the super-cell. He step- 
ped back into the hall, a rifle in 
his hands, brought up the gun, and 
sighted. ^^Move away!” 

Gnossus and Hurkos stepped be- 
hind him, moving toward the con- 
trol cabin. Aiming for the center 




128 



IF 



•f the mass, Sam pulled the trigger. 
Hue lightning flashed outward, 
sparkling, and illuminated the pas- 
sageway like a small sun going nova. 
Bespite the light, there was no 
heat. In fact, the flame seemed to 
radiate coolness. It struck the writh- 
ing mass of jelly, sank into it. 
There was something like a scream, 
though it was not a voice. It sound- 
ed as if the very molecules of the 
mass had closed gaps and were rub- 
hing one another. The jelly halted. 

Sam released the trigger, started 
to let the air out of his lungs. 

And the jelly leapt. 

T Te fired, caught it in mid-jump, 
^ sent it crashing backwards, 
blue fire coursing through it. He 



aimed again, depressed the stud. 

Nothing. 

Nothing! 

No blue flame. No cool flame. 
Not even a click. He raised the 
weapon to look at it, to see if some 
latch or bolt had not been thrown 
properly by the automatic mech- 
anism. Then he saw the amber goo 
beginning to pulse out of the tip 
of the barrel. Suddenly his hand 
was burning furiously, and there 
was amoeba slopping out of the 
powerpack casing inside the han- 
dle. He threw the gun down, wiped 
his hand on the wall. 

” Explosives I” Gnossos shouted. 

Sam turned, dashed into the ar- 
mory once more. When he came out, 
he had three grenades. He ran to 




IN THE SHIELD 



129 




Gnossos and Hurkos, panting, his 
eyes wide, heart furious. 

The jelly-mass was recovering 
and had slopped into the hall where 
it joined up to the smaller dump 
of stuff that had been the insides 
of the gun. 

think I see why the radio 
didn’t work, Gnossos said. ”It did 
not want to work.” 

^^The entire ship is alive,” Sam 
agreed. 

Hurkos wrapped a hand on the 
wall. ^Tt’s steel. I’ll be damned 
if it’s anything but stedi” 

'Tnside,” Sam said, keeping an 
eye on the amoeba pulsating at the 
end of the passageway. ^^Deep in- 
side the plating, there’s more jelly.” 
^^But the h}rper-drive — ” 

” There is no hyper-drive,” Sam 
said. ^'At least, no mechanical hy- 
per-drive. The jelly can hyperspace 
somehow — naturally. There are no 
machines on board — just jelly- 
cored shells. 

^^Your fear of machines — ” 
Hurkos began. 

Was gained from whomever built 
this — this ship-thing.” 

The lump had begun to move 
again. It was six feet high, a good 
three hundred pounds. 

^^You two get into suits,” Gnos- 
sos said, taking the grenades. He 
still had his own suit on and the 
helmet lay within easy reach. "We 
will have to go across to my ship. 
This one won’t let us live long, now 
that we know part of its secret.” 



S am and Hurkos struggled into 
their suits, fitted the helmets 
to the shoulder threads, attached 
air tanks. When they were dressed, 
Gnossos pulled the hatch shut, 
sealing the main cabin from the 
hallway where the thing was ad- 
vancing warily. “Let’s see it get 
through that,” the poet said, put- 
ting on his helmet. "Now let’s get 
out of here.” 

“I’m afraid there isn’t much 
hope of that,” Sam said from his 
position next to the control panel. 
"I’ve pressed all buttons to de- 
pressurize the cabin and open the 
exit chamber, but I can’t see any 
response from the ship.” 

Hurkos jumped to the console, 
flipped on the comline to the com- 
puter that wasn’t a computer. "Let 
us out I” 

There was a deafening roar from 
the wire and plastic voice. There 
were screams, thunders, explosions. 
It sounded like a thousand rats 
burning alive. 

"Shut it off!” Gnossos shouted. 
Hurkos slammed the switch off. 
The noise continued. At first it 
swept them in irregular waves, 
shr^ded them and put them back 
together. Then there was not even 
a pattern of waves but a constant 
din. And there was jelly spewing 
out of the speaker grid . 

Jelly spewing out of all jack- 
holes . 

In a moment, the speaker grid 
was gone, thrust away by the surg- 

IF 



130 




ing pressure of the thing behind it. 
Parts of the console began to sag 
as the supportive gum that had 
filled it drained away. 

Still the noise persisted. ''It’s 
the same sound,” Sam shouted into 
his suit phone, "that I heard when 
I was obeying the hypnotic com- 
mands.” 

‘‘The grenades 1” Hurkos shouted 
as the jelly began to collect on the 
floor, change from amber to pink- 
tan, and rise in a pulsating mass. 
The other glob pressed against the 
hatch from the hallway. There was 
the screeching of metal being strain- 
ed to its limits. Soon the hatch 
would give, and they would be 
trapped between two shapeless 
jelly-things. It would cover them 
and do whatever it did to flesh and 
blood and bones. 

Gnossos flipped the cap that dis- 
solved the anti-shock packing in the 
outer shell of the grenade. He toss- 
ed it. There was no result. 

"The grenades are jelly tool” 
Hurkos shouted. 

Sam snatched one of the remain- 
ing bulbs from the poet. "No. They 
aren’t machines. It’s a naturd 
chemical that explodes without me- 
chanical prompting. It just needs 
a jar; you didn’t throw it hard 
enough.” He sailed the second 
against the glass viewplate. 

A 11 the world was a sun. A light- 
bulb. Then the filament began 
to die — the light went completely 



out. The force of the explosion had 
gone, mostly, outward. What had 
pressed in their directibn had been 
caught by the mass of jelly that 
rose to snatch at the grenade, un- 
successfully. Miraculously, they 
were tumbling through the shat- 
tered front of the ship, moving into 
the darkness and emptiness of space 
toward the Ship of the Soul, the 
poet’s boat that lay silently a short 
mile away. 

Behind them the jelly came, boil- 
ing away in the vacuum, tumbling 
and sputtering. Steaming, it lashed 
out with non^rms. The thunder of 
its non-voice was definitely not 
sound but thought. It bombarded 
their minds. 

Hurkos was out ahead, his shotil- 
der jets pushing him swiftly toward 
the ship’s portal. Then came the 
poet. Finally, Sam. A hand of 
false-flesh streaked arqund the lat- 
ter, curled in front of him, at- 
tempting to cut him off from the 
others and devour him. He choked, 
maneuvered under the whip before 
it could sweep around and cap- 
toe him. 

And still it came. It grew small- 
er, boiled and bubbled itself away. 
But there was always a new cen- 
tral mass moving out from the hull, 
trying to leap the blackness. Yet 
finally there was nothing left except 
a speck of pinkish-tan. Then it too 
puffed out of existence. With it 
went the noise. 

Inside the Ship of the Soul, they 



IN THE SHIELD 



131 




stripped and collapsed into soft 
chairs without animate padding. 
This was a ship of comfort — not 
one of destruction. This was a ship 
built for six people if necessary — 
not for one man, one tool of an in- 
sane unnamable entity without a 
face or time. For a while, then, they 
were silent, composing themselves 
for what must be said. The moment 
the composing ended and the talk- 
ing began was signaled by a quiet 
suggestion from Gnossos that they 
get some wine to help loosen their 
tongues. 

The wine was warm, green. 

^^It was the same sound I heard 
under the hypnotic commands,” 
Sam said. 

^^That means,” Hurkos said, star- 
ing into his wine as he talked, ^Hhat 
it was the ship itself that was or- 
dering you around. That jelly-mass 
was the plotter behind the scheme.” 

nossos downed one glass of 
VX wine, poured a second from 
the decanter. ”I don’t agree. If the 
ship were responsible for Sam’s ac- 
tions, there would be no reason for 
post-hypnotic suggestions. It was 
close enough to use a more direct 
method. And when he shot it, it 
should have been able to order him 
to throw the gun down. No, the 
ship was just a cancerous mass of 
go© that was to convey Sam to 
Hope. Nothing more.” 

^^But what kind of man could 
make a thing like the jelly-mass?” 
132 



” I think,” Gnossos said, ”that 
there is a chance you are the dupe 
of an extra-galactic intelligence.” 
'^That’s absurd; that’s — ” 

” That’s frighteningly possible,” 
Hurkos reflected. There are thou- 
sands and millions of galaxies out 
there. How do you know a bunch 
of jelly-masses didn’t kidnap you, 
take you away, and decide to train 
you to overthrow your home gal- 
axy?” 

Sam finished his wine in a gulp. 
Heat flooded through his flesh. 
Still, it could not ward off the chill 
in him. "Because,” he answered in 
even, measured tones, "that would 
be one helluva backward way of 
invading the Federation. If these 
extra-galactics have all this skill — 
can use something like the blob 
back there for hyper-spacing and 
making food and operating robo- 
surgeons — they could overturn 
the galaxy in a month. A week! 
Hell, that blob even talked to me 
in a computer voice. Probably forms 
some crude set of vocal cords when 
it needs them. And it operated like 
a radar set; it — ” 

"It’s a living machine,” Gnos- 
sos said, almost to himself. 

iC'T^hat’s another thing,” Hurkos 
added. "Your fear of ma- 
chines. You got it, obviously, be- 
cause whoever — or whatever — 
hypnotized you fears machines also. 
Because, he, it or they do not use 
machines. They have blobs, living 

IF 




things that are machines. That al- 
most proves they’re extra-galactic. 
We have nothing like this.” 

”One couldn’t live in the Feder- 
ation without the aid of machines,” 
Gnossos agreed. ^^One would have 
to be from — Outside.” 

^^No.” Sam set his glass on the 
floor. ^'No, if there were extra-ga- 
lactics with this sort of thing, they 
woiddn’t need me.” 

"Agreed also,” the poet said. 
"Looks like there is a stalemate in 
this conversation.” He heaved his 
bulk to a more comfortable posi- 
tion. "Well, I for one am sticking 
with you until this mystery is un- 
raveled. I couldn’t bear to quit yet. 
This could be the most important, 
most dangerous event of the last 
thousand years. Warring man might 
have been crude, but he sure as 
Hell had his fill of danger in a 
lifetime. Today we travel on, living 
hundreds of years, and everything 
is so safe and perfect that we rare- 
ly ever experience danger. I’m ready 
for some excitement!” 

"Me too, I guess,” Hurkos said. 
Sam had the feeling the Mue was 
not terribly comfortable since the 
jelly-mass had attacked them. But 
he would not — could not — back 
down in front of the poet. 

"So what next?” 

Gnossos rubbed a hand across his 
chin, wrinkled his nose for a mo- 
ment. "We set this tub on a course 
for Hope. When we get there, we 
wait for your next command. We’re 



going to find out just what this is 
all about.” 

"But,” Sam said uneasily, "sup- 
pose I am to overthrow the gal- 
axy?” 

"Hurkos and I will be right be- 
hind you to stop you before you 
have a chance.” 

"I hope so,” he said. 

Later, after more wine and much 
conjecture as the Ship of the Soul 
plunged through the thick river of 
the void, they retired, leaning back 
in their chairs, belting themselves, 
in, and shutting their mouths so 
that they could neither consume 
nor converse. And eventually they 
fell into sleep . 

IV 

tT^here was a darkness, save for 
the pinpoints of the stars dot- 
ting the entire roof of the night. 
Then, as the breezes shifted, dawn 
came crawling over the horizon, 
tinting the blackness with yellow. 

. Then orange . .And there 
was a hill with a cross atop it; 
there was a man on the cross. His 
hands were dripping blood. 

And his feet were dripping blood. 

The wounds had festered. 

The man on the cross raised his 
head, looked to the dawn. He 
seemed very weary. There were 
clumps of matting at the corners 
of his eyes. His teeth were yellow. 

^^Damnit, let me downT he 
shrieked. 



IN THE SHIELD 



133 




The words rehounded from the 
low sky. 

Please/^ he said, begging. 

The sun was a flaming eye. When 
it was at its zenith, there came an- 
gels, beings of light and majesty. 
They flocked about the man, ad- 
ministered to his needs. Some car- 
ried water which they poured be- 
tween his cracked lips, and some 
brought oil with which they anoint- 
ed him. And some sponged away 
the oil while others fed him. Then 
they were gone. 

The sun was setting. It seemed 
only minutes since it had risen. 

Please,'' the man said. The an- 
gels had missed some of the oil in 
his beard. It glistened there. 

With darkness came the demons. 
Crawling from under brown stones, 
slithering out of crevices in the 
earth, they came. There were 
dwarfs, slavering, eyeless yet see- 
ing. There were wolves with sabers 
for teeth. There were things with 
tails and horns, things with heads 
that were nothing more than huge 
mouths. They screamed and caw- 
wed, muttered, shrieked, and moan- 
ed. They came at the cross, crawling 
over one another. But they could 
not reach the man. They clawed the 
wood of his prison but could not 
claw him. One by one, they began 
to die . 

They withered and became white 
ghosts that the cool wind bore away. 
They collapsed into dust. They 
dribbled into blood pools. 



Then there were stars for a time. 
And again came the dawn . 
And the angels . 

And the night and the demons 
and the stars and the dawn and the 
angels and the night ... It con- 
tinued at a maddening pace. Days 
became weeks; weeks turned to 
months. For years he hung there; 
for centuries, he remained. And 
finally, all time was lost as the sun 
spun madly across the sky and 
night with its devils was barely a 
blink of the eye. 

Please!" he screamed.. 

last scream brought them 
out of sleep, breathing hard. 
Sam pushed himself up, looked 
about the ship to reassure himself. 
Then he turned to Hurkos. ^'What 
sort of dream was that?” 

Gnossos looked curious. 

''He’s a telepath,” Sam explain- 
ed. "Irregular talent. But what the 
Hell kind of thoughts were those?” 
"That’s what I’d like to know,” 
Hurkos said. "I was getting them 
from you ! ” 

^^Me?" 

"Well, not really from your 
mind.. Through your mind. The 
generator of those thoughts is very 
distant, no one in this room. And 
the mind is horrifyingly large. This 
was a fraction of its thoughts, a 
small corner. In this case, I picked 
up this tr^ce of thoughts and — for 
some reason — my subconscious tal- 
ent began boosting their vividness

and also re-broadcasting them.” 

^^But I wouldn’t have dreamed 
this without yoxu: help.” 

Hurkos smiled sadly. ”You 
wouldn’t have been aware of it. 
You would have been dreaming it 
nonetheless.” 

^^But what was it? It’s like the 
man on the cross you toppled.” 

^'It’s the Christ legend,” Gnossos 
said. They turned to stare at him. 
'T make legends my business. Poets 
work in all sorts of mythologies. 
There have been a large number of 
wild ones too. The Christ legend 
is not so ancient. There are still 
Christians, as you know — though 
damned few. Most of the religion 
died out about a thousand years 
ago, shortly after the Permanent 
Peace and the immortality drugs. 
According to legend, the god-figure, 
Christ, was crucified on a dogwood 
cross. This dream seems to be a re- 
enactment of that myth, though I 
do not recall that the man hung 
there that long or that there were 
administering angels and tempting 
demons.” 

”This could be another clue,” 
Hurkos offered. 

^^How so?” Sam was ready to 
clutch at any straw. 

^Terhaps your invisible hypno- 
tist is a neo-Christian, one of those 
who refuse the immortality drugs. 
That would certainly explain why 
he would want to overthrow the 
Federation. He would want to con- 
vert the pagans. That’s us.” 



^^Good point,” Gnossos said, '^But 
that doesn’t explain the blob.” 

Hurkos lapsed into silence. 

Bong-bong-bong! PREPARE FOR 
NORMAL SPACE AND MANU- 
AL CONTROL OF THIS VES- 
SELl 

''We’re almost to Hope,” Gnossos 
said. "Perhaps we will soon be hav- 
ing more clues.” 

'^he flight-control system of the 
planet-wide super-city locked 
them into its pattern and began 
bringing them down to a point of its 
own choosing, since they had not 
requested any particular touchdown 
spot. Ships fluttered above and be- 
low them. Bubble cars spun across 
the great elevated roadways, be- 
tween the buildings, sometimes slip- 
ping into tunnels in the skyscrapers 
from which they often emerged go- 
ing another direction or did not 
emerge at all. They settled onto 
a gray pad where the flames of 
their landing were soaked up, cool- 
ed, dissipated. 

Beyond the pad, on all sides, 
Hope lay sparkling. They stood at 
the open portaf and waited while 
the attendant marked their check- 
slip so that they would have the 
proper ship returned to them and 
gave them half. 

"Well,” Gnossos said, "where 
to?” 

"No orders yet,” Sam said. 

Let’s just wander around a bit,” 
Hurkos suggested. 



IN THE SHIELD 



135 




And they did. 

T Te sat before the thick window 
^ ^ that was not really a window 
at all, and he looked at the thing 
b^ond. It raged, lashing, scream- 
ing, roaring. How long? How long 
had it fought against the Shield, 
tr}dng to get out? Breadloaf peered 
deeper into the Shield, leaned deep- 
er into his chair. The massive desk 
nearly concealed his slumped form. 
Over a thousand years. That was 
how long. His father had con- 
structed the barrier, the chamber 
beyond which dipped into anoth- 
er dimension. No, not another di- 
mension — a higher dimension. And 
when his father had died in a freak 
accident from which the medics 
could not undo the damage, he had 
come into possession of the family 
fortune, the family buildings; the 
family office structure in the cen- 
ter of Hope, the Shield and tank 
beyond. The last two were things 
that one did not advertise. It was a 
family secret — a big, hoary skel- 
eton in the family closet. The bur- 
den was his — and his only. 

For six himdred* years, he had 
come here every week, sometimes 
for stretches that lasted days, most 
often for just a few hours. He came 
to look at the Shield. It was a 
weight that rested heavily on his 
shoulders at all times. It was in- 
sane to worry. The shield had held 
for a thousand years; it would hold 
forever. It coidd not fail. It was 



maintained by machines, and ma- 
chines had not been known to fail 
since his grandfather’s time. These 
machines were not tended by unre- 
liable men, but by other machines 
that gained their power from still 
more machines. It was fool-proof. 

Still, Alexander Breadloaf III 
came once a week, sometimes stay- 
ing a long time. 

Crimson exploded across the 
Shield, washed down and turned to 
ocher at the bottom. Explosions 
would not shatter the Shield, no 
matter how violent they might be. 
Didn’t it understand this by now? 
A thousand years of explosions, 
and still it did not understand. That 
thought left a sorry spot in his 
soul, but he reminded himself of 
what his father always said — said 
so often that it became the family 
motto: There is no longer ignor- 

ance in men.” Maybe. Evidently. 
Although he feared ignorance lurk- 
ed just below the surface, waiting 
for a chance ... 

There was a lovely pattern of 
blue and silver as it applied certain 
stress pattern sequences to the 
shield. But it had tried that before. 
It had tried ever)d:hing before . 

He pushed himself from the chair, 
and walked toward the door that 
led into the hallway. He would get 
some simple foods, some coffee. 
And he would return. This was one 
of those times when a brief glance 
at it was not going to be enough. 
It was going to be one of those

weeks. One of those long weeks. 
V 

I n their wandering, they had gone 
to the light shows, the total- 
experience places. They had seen 
the parks, the avenues of art. Gnos- 
sos knew the city well, that being 
one of the qualifications of a true 
poet to know the beating heart of 
megalopolis. He explained all things 
they did not understand, clarified 
things they thought they knew. It 
was rather a gay time, save for the 
constant awareness that another 
hypnotic trance and order could be 
on the way, minutes from them, 
ready to swallow Sam into a noisy 
chaos and use him. 

So it was, in the course of their 
aimless ramblings, they came upon 
the Christian. Sam noticed that 
Hurkos bristled at the sight of the 
man — not because of this individ- 
ual, but because of the heedless god 
behind him. 

The Christian was old. He was 
fifty, ancient in a world where all 
were eternally thirty or younger. 
He had obviously been the child of 
a strong Christian family, for he 
had not received even anti-beard 
elements; the heavy shadow on his 
face gave him a metallic look. His 
teeth were yellow. His skin was 
wrinkled. Across his chest and back 
hung the halves of a sandwich sign. 
The front said: GOD MUST BE 
ASHAMED ! 1 When the man saw

them coming, he executed a small 
heel turn to reveal the words on 
his back sign: HE SHALL COME 
AGAIN TO JUDGEI I 

'T can’t understand them,” Hur- 
kos*said. 

Gnossos smiled a thin smile. 
''Some day they will all be gone.” 

"But why are there these peo- 
ple?” Sam asked. "Don’t the medics 
prevent mental infirmities in ba- 
bies?” 

"Well,” the poet said, trying to 
shorten his giant strides to match 
the smaUer steps of his companions, 
"the original concept of the Feder- 
ation was complete freedom. Mental 
infirmities were weeded out, true, 
true. As a result, the numbers of 
religious people dropped over the 
years. But one cannot limit another 
man’s beliefs under a system of 
complete freedom. So religious per- 
sons were allowed to practice their 
beliefs. Though their children might 
be born mentally sound, the parents 
raised them and passed their super- 
stitions on to their offspring. The 
number of religious dwindled. But 
as long as they procreated — and 
this is a strong part of their reli- 
gion, these Christians — they would 
always have children to indoctrin- 
ate, to warp. It’s a shame. But, af- 
ter all, it is their life. A man, I 
guess, can waste his own life if he 
chooses.” 

C 4 now the word,” the Christian 
said as they drew abreast 



of him. He handed Gnossos and 
Sam pamphlets — yellow paper 
with red print. 

"I’ll take one too,” Hurkos said. 

There was no reply from the Chris- 
tian, and Hurkos asked again. 

"Will you ask this person of 
tainted blood to cease speaking to 
me?” the boarded one asked Sam. 
He was obviously distressed, run- 
ning his thin, bony hands up and 
down the edges of his chest sign. 

"Tainted blood?” Sam asked. 

"They don’t like Mues,” Gnossos 
explained. "They would never 
speak to one.” 

"Why?” 

"A Mue is not a creation of God, 
but the work of man,” the Chris- 
tian said. "A Mue is a violation of 
God’s holy power of creation.” His 
eyes gleamed fanatically. 

"Prejudice,” Gnossos said. "It’s 
part of the dogma of every religion 
— sometimes heavily disguised, but 
always there. Do you know the 
history of your church, old man?” 

The Christian shuffled his feet. 
"Of course. In the beginning — ” 

"It doesn’t start that far back,” 
Gnossos laughed. He licked his lips. 
"It doesn’t start with the darkness 
and light and the first seven days. 
It comes along much later. There’s 
no church until man decides he 
needs a means of social climbing, 
something to make him superior to 
his neighbors. So he forms a church, 
a religion. By forming it, he can 
say that he knows what and why 

IF 



138 




God is. He can say he knows the 
purpose of things and can — there- 
fore — be a cut above other men.” 
”God chose Saint Peter to start 
the church, to be above other men.” 
Gnossos smiled patronizingly. 
doubt that. History is studded with 
men who said God had chosen them 
to be leaders. Most of them fell 
flat on their faces. Most of them 
got trampled down and smashed in 
the flow of time and history — 
which are two things bigger than 
any man.” 

False Prophets,” the sign-carrier 
said. 

”So why don’t you call Saint Peter 
a false prophet?” 

^^What he began is still function- 
ing.” 

” Duration does not prove worth. 
Wars lasted a helluva lot longer 
than your religion has, but they 
were finished and done away with 
because they were not good things. 
It seems to me that your faith is 
facing a similar end.” 

Qam made a face. ''But why hate 
Hurkos just because he is not 
directly God-created? If God gave 
men the power to invent and use 
the Artificial Wombs, then he was 
involved in the creation of the 
Mues, though — ” 

"Men usurped the power,” the 
Christian said. 

"But if God is all-powerful, men 
could not usurp — ” 

Gnossos put a hand on Sam’s 



shoulder. "It is not for this reason 
that Christians hate Mues. As I 
said, they have to feel superior. 
There are so few people they can 
look down on anymore; the Mue 
offers a perfect scapegoat. Because 
he is so often abnormal physically, 
they have something visible to feel 
superior about.” 

A crowd had begun to gather 
around the debate. This seemed to 
please Gnossos, though it irritated 
the Christian. 

"And my dear fdlow,” Gnossos 
continued in a friendly tone, "do 
you know who started many of the 
wars in the past three thousand 
years?” 

"Satan’s forces.” 

"No. Christians. In — ” 

The bearded man showed his 
teeth in what coidd have been a 
snarl if he had added sound. "I 
will not pursue this argument any 
longer. You are in Satan’s employ.” 
He moved quicily, pushing at the 
crowd that had gathered. They hes- 
itated, then parted to let him 
through. He was gone into the breast 
of night to be suckled by its dark- 
ness. 

"You don’t imagine you did any 
good,” Hurkos said as the crowd 
around them dispersed and they 
began walking again. "You don’t 
imagine you got through that bony 
structure he calls a head, do you?” 

"No. But I can’t resist tr3dng. 
He is unreachable by this time. 
Besides, even if he doubted his

U9 




faith, he would not allow himself to 
give that doubt prominence in his 
thoughts. He had forsaken concrete 
eternity via the inmiortality drugs, 
and now he has nothing to cling to 
but the hopes of his religion, the 
promises of God.” 

” Gives me the shivers,” Sam said. 

This is getting too morbid,” 
Gnossos said. ” Let’s find a hotel 
and settle down. My feet are kill- 
ing me, and there is no telling how 
much running we might have to do 
to catch Sam if he gets another 
order.” 

T> readloaf finished the last pieces 
of his sandwich, took a swal- 
low of black coffee and leaned back 
in the chair. The room was dark, 
for the thing behind the Shield 
was not the thing for well-lighted 
rooms. Its details were brought out 
too fully in light. Blackness allow- 
ed obs<hmty. 

Cinnabar horsemen riding green 
stallions exploded across the screen, 
were gone in a wash of lavender . 

He liked to pick out patterns in 
the explosion of color, choose and 
name them as some men do with 
clouds. 

A Dragon^s mouth holding the 
broken body of an amber knight . 

Alexander Breadloaf III wonder- 
ed whether his father had sat like 
this, watching the patterns and try- 
ing to make sometJiing of them: it 
was a seeking after order; certain^ 
ly that was the purpose of watching 



them. Had his father sat here, his 
great leonine head bowed in con- 
templation, his heavy brows run 
together from the forehead-min- 
kling concentration? Had he laced 
his thick fingers behind his water- 
fall of white hair and watched — 
actually studied — the Prisoner of 
the Shield as the family had come 
to speak of it? 

He doubted it. His father had 
been a man of hard work and ac- 
tion. He had built his father’s small 
fortune into a very large fortune. 
When his engineers accidentally 
stumbled across the Shield while 
looking for a non-matter material 
for construction purposes, when 
they had discovered what lay be- 
yond, the old man took the prac- 
tical angle. He knew there was a 
fortune to be made here, more than 
his already formidable masses of 
wealth. He had only to enslave the 
powers behind the Shield and turn 
them to work for himself. The 
Shield was maintained. But the 
powers could never be enslaved. 
To agree to slavery, the slave must 
have fear of his master. And there 
was no fear in the Prisoner. None. 

Brilliant flashes of white rippled 
like fish through a sudden sea of 
smoked burgundy . 

T Tis heart thudded at the bright 
^ ^ light, even though he knew 
the Shield was impenetrable. Take 
one molecule and expand it. Ex- 
pand it some more. Make it bigger 

IF 



140 




and bigger and bigger — but don’t 
disturb its natural particle dimen- 
sions. A barred doorway — really 
a window. But that window turns 
the higher dimension into a prison, 
squeezes it into a confined space ^ — 
a law of opposites which equalizes 
the pressures created by expanding 
the first molecule. The higher dimen- 
sion is then bound within tiny limits. 
It and its inhabitants are trapped, 
unable to move or get out. 

Brilliant white flashes . , 

No, his father had never sat here 
like this. He was too practical for 
melancholia. Along about the sec- 
ond hundred years of the Prisoner’s 
confinement, the old fellow had re- 
alized he could never enslave it. 
And as the years passed, he came to 
maintain the Shield only because to 
let it die out would mean the end 
of his family and possibly all human 
life. The Prisoner would be seeking 
revenge. By the days of Alexander 
the Third, this fear of the Prisoner 
had been compounded by a feeling 
of moral obligation. The sanity 
and progress of the Federation de- 
pended on keeping the Prisoner im- 
prisoned. Always, in the rear of his 
mind, was the fear that the thing 
would escape. Sometimes, that fear 
surged to the fore. At times like 
these he wanted to run into the 
street and scream about his charge 
behind the Shield. But the Bread- 
loafs had done this thing, had trap- 
ped it. It would be up to the Bread- 
loafs to watch it for all eternity. 



Finally, when watching was not 
quite enough, Alexander walked to 
the Shidd, stood with a hand upon 
the coursing energy. ^^How did 
you,” he said to the thing beyond, 
become like this?” 

It could only thought-speak to him 
when he was touching the Shield. 
And even then the words were tiny 
and distant: ^'Letmeout, letme- 

out . ” 

^^How did you become like this?” 
'^Letmeout^ letmeout, letmeout/^ 
That was its constant cry. Some- 
times there were threats. He knew 
— and it knew — that the threats 
could not be carried out. Not as 
long as the Shield was there. But it 
seemed reluctant now to answer his 
question: ^^How did you become 
like this.” 

He knew the answer anyway: 
"/ have always been like this . .” 

/^n hydro-mattresses, redining, 
they opened their ears. The 
hotel room was pleasant. Gnossos 
lay before the door so that Sam 
would have to crawl over him to 
get out. The lights were warm, the 
wine sweet upon their tongues. It 
was certainly a time for verses. 

Lo$k through the window 
to the streets below; 

Ws the age of sorrow, 
babies freezing in the snow; 

Look through any window 
across a sea of lust; 

Ws a time for grinding 



IN THE SHIELD 



141 




every bone to dust. 

Look through my window . 

Then it was time for sleep. The 
wine had been drunk, the verses 
spoken, and the darkness crept over 
them. 

For a time, at least . 

A dream. A dream of an empty 
tomb and rotting bodies. Except for 
one single body which stood and 
walked toward the doorway. And 
the dream was one of demons that 
grasped the body and flung it 
down among the corpses and com- 
manded it to stay dead. Always 
and everywhere, there were slaver- 
ing, keening demons . 

Then Hurkos lost the thread of 
the alien thoughts and the trio 
awoke as one. They were all per- 
spiring. 

^^Not mine again?” Sam asked. 

” Relayed from somewhere im- 
planted your hypnotic commands. 
Very far away.” 

But the smell of spoiled meat 
had carried over into reality. 

^^Well,” Gnossos said, grumbling 
and standing, ‘T certainly can’t 
sleep now.” 

They agreed. 

^^So let’s go sight-seeing again. 
Maybe the next command will be 
coming along soon now?” 

Where to?” Hurkos asked. 'Ts 
it far? My feet still hurt.” 

^^Not far,” Gnossos said. There 
are a number of them. This one is 
called the InfernoJ* 



VI 

'^he Inferno was a bar. But more 
^ than a bar. Everything here 
was geared to some sensory stimu- 
lation. Ebony and silver clouds 
drifted through the rooms of the 
place, carrying nude performers. 
Floor panels popped open, spewed 
forth clowns in imagi-color costumes 
that were purple, yellow, red, or 
green according to one’s mood. The 
floor revolved at a different speed 
than the walls and in a different di- 
rection than the ceiling. Strobe 
lights flashed. Smello-symphonies 
treated the patron’s senses to mo- 
ments of synathesia where music 
was an olfactory sensation. The 
erotic cygian perfumes seeped 
through the misty air, seeking nos- 
trils to inflame. 

They took a table in the corner 
one almost hidden by shadows. The 
robo-tender- in the center of the 
table delivered their drinks once 
Gnossos had compiled an order, 
punched it out and deposited the 
proper coins. They sat sipping the 
cool liquids and watching the two 
dozen or so characters in the place. 

^^What’s so special about this 
bar?” Sam asked, almost choking 
on a particularly heavy breath of 
perfume. 

^^Look at the people,” Gnossos 
said. 

Sam did. He could see no way in 
which they differed from Federa- 
tion norm in dress or habit. 



142 



IF 




'Took more closely. Look at their 
faces.” 

Sam swung his gaze from the rud- 
dy face to the more distant visages, 
lut it was their faces. The longer 
he watched, the clearer he saw it. 
But what was it? He searched his 
mind, looking for some comparison. 
He was just about to give up when 
the perfect simile sprang into his 
mind. The look in their faces was 
much like the look in the faces of 
scooterbeasts when they were pen- 
ned in zoos. In a natural state, the 
scooterbeasts moved as quickly as 
lightning across a storm sky. Pen- 
ned, they pressed their faces to the 
glass walls and looked mournfully 
toward freedom, wishing to move, 
to travel, to do something denied 
them. ^T see it,” he said to Gnos- 
sos. 

''They’re Unnaturals.” 

"The ones — ” 

"Who would like to kill,” Gnossos 
said. "They are defects born with 
many of the old faults — with 
the desire to kill, an overwhelming 
greed and bent toward self-gratifi- 
cation. There is nothing the gov- 
ernment can do but make them Sen- 
sitive. If they hurt someone, they 
also feel pain. If they aid someone, 
they feel the other’s person’s joy 
and pleasure. It is wiser for them 
to aid than harm. If they killed 
someone, they would feel the death 
spasms ten times more intensely 
than the victim. None of them 
would dare that.” 



"He knows about the Unnatur- 
als,” Hurkos said, "but he did not 
know about the Mues.” 

"Or my own past,” Sam remind- 
ed them. 

G nossos ordered another drink 
from the robo-tender, deposit- 
ed his coins and waited for the li- 
quor. None came. He pounded it 
once, then bellowed for the human 
tapkeeper polishing glasses behind 
the bar. He was growing red-faced 
as he had been when his and Sam’s 
ships collided — a false anger put 
on merely for the pleasure of ap- 
pearing furious. The tapkeeper 
opened the gate in the bar and 
crossed the room with strides as sure 
and quick, almost, as those of 
Gnossos. In his eyes glittered the 
tenseness, the trapped expression. 

"This thing is broken!” Gnos 
SOS roared. "I want my money 
back!” 

"Here,” the human bartender 
said, flipping a coin to the poet. 
"Now all of you had better leave, 
please.” 

"Why?” Sam asked. 

"This is not a Natural bar.” 
"You’re a Natural if I ever saw 
one,” Hurkos mumbled. 

"We are allowed service any- 
where. Naturals and Unnaturals are 
not segregated.” 

Shuffling his feet, suddenly a 
little cowed — or taking a new 
line of tact, perhaps — the bar- 
tender said, "It’s just for your own 



IN THE SHIELD 



143 




safety.” There was a mixture of 
fear and general uneasiness in his 
eyes now. 

^^Was that a threat?” Gnossos 
boomed. ^'Am I with the uncivil- 
ized?” 

^'Not a threat. It^s just him — 
that one.” 

They followed the tabkeeper^s 
thumb as it jerked toward the fel- 
low standing at the far corner of 
the bar. He was clutching a glass of 
yellow liquid, taking large gulps 
of it without effort. He was huge, 
nearly as huge as Gnossos, red- 
headed and red-eyed. His giant 
hands clenched into fists, unclench- 
ed again. Though physically a bit 
smaller than Gnossos, he had mus- 
cle where the poet had run some- 
what to fat. The corded masses of 
tissue that were his arms seemed 
able to snap anything or anyone to 
pieces. 

Who’s he?” Gnossos asked. 

'"Black Jack Buronto.” 

"You’ve got to be kidding,” Hur- 
kos said, slumping farther into his 
chair. "You must be.” 

"Henry Buronto ’s his name, but 
he wins all the time at the gaming 
tables, so they call him Black Jack. 
And he carries one too — a black- 
jack.” 

Many Unnaturals carried crude 
weapons, wishing they could use 
them, but never daring to because 
of the pain echoes that would en- 
gulf them. Clearly, Gnossos was 
fascinated by Buronto. Here was 



someone a bit different. Here was 
someone smiled on by Fortune, 
someone perhaps stronger than him- 
self. And someone, for some reason, 
to be feared. 

"He’s dangerous,” the tapkeeper 
said. 

"Dangerous because he carries a 
blackjack and wins at cards?” 

"No. Dangerous because he 
would use the blackjack. He could 
kill all three of you just like thatT 
The tapkeeper snapped his fingers. 
He cast a glance at all three of 
them, then looked back to Buronto. 

A Imost as if he had seen a signal, 
Buronto started across the 
room toward them. 

"Please leave,” the tapkeeper 
said. 

"I think maybe we had better,” 
Sam agreed. 

"Why?” Gnossos asked. "He 
won’t hurt us. Remember, every 
pain we feel, he feels ten times 
over.” 

"But — ” the Tapkeeper started. 

"You’re talking about me,” Bur- 
onto said, stepping up to their 
table. And his voice was like the 
voice of a canary — high and sweet 
and melodic. The trio stared at one 
another for a moment, astounded. 
The tiny voice again seeped from 
the massive throat. "Were you 
talking about me?” 

Sam tittered, then let go and 
burst out laughing. Gnossos follow- 
ed with his laugh like thunder.

IF 




Hurkos fought it, seeming t® be 
comfortable in his recently self-im- 
posed melancholia. 

Buronto spoke again: "Stop 

laughing at me!” 

The order was so high-pitched 
that his voice cracked in the mid- 
dle of it. And Hurkos too burst out 
laughing, spraying the table with 
saliva he had Wn fighting to hold 
back with the laugh. 

"Stop it! Stop it;” Buronto 
shouted. 

But the tension within the three 
of them had been at a peak. They 
had been restless, nervous, on edge 
since the encounter with the jelly- 
mass. The constant state of ex- 
pectancy had honed their nerves to 
sharp, thin wires that were ready 
to vibrate whenever even slightly 
plucked. And Black Jack Buronto’s 
voice had been the tuning fork that 
had set them all roaring as the 
tension drained. They laughed all 
out of proportion to the joke. 

"Oh no, no, no,” the tapkeeper 
said. He moaned it over and over 
like a litany. 

"Shut up!” Buronto roared, 
squeakily. His mouth was foaming. 
He brought a colossal fist down on 
the simu-wood table, knocked all 
the glasses off. But this too sent 
them into paroxysms of laughter. 
Hurkos was leaning on Gnossos, 
and Sam had his head thrown back, 
howling. 

Black Jack muttered something 
nearly incomprehensible. Clasping 



one fist in the other, he smashed 
the wedge of his flesh onto the ta- 
ble top, shattered the thing into 
two halves that stood separately for 
a moment until the weight of the 
broken top pulled the lamented 
leg apart and the table collapsed 
into the laps of three Naturals. 
They ceased their laughter. 

Black Jack Buronto now had a 
face like a jungle animal. Great 
swatches of ugly blue slashed the 
once uniform red of his face. His 
teeth were bared. He snarled and 
spat foam and screeched unintelli- 
gible things between his teeth. He 
was mad as all Hell. He latched on- 
to Hurkos’s chair, ripped it out 
from under the Mue and sent him 
crashing to the floor. 

"What the Hell?” Gnossos said to 
the tapkeeper. "He’s an Unnatural, 
but he’s also a Sensitive!” 

"He’s a Sensitive, yes,” the tap- 
keeper shouted as Black Jack 
smashed Hurkos’s chair into the 
wall again and again. "He’s a Sen- 
sitive and feels his victim’s pain. 
But he was more Unnatural than 
the doctors knew. He’s also a 
masochist! ” 

'nphe color drained from the poet’s 
face. "Then he likes being a 
Sensitive — ” 

The bartender finished: "Because 
he likes to feel pain!” 

Buronto had finished with the 
chair. There was nothing left of 
it that could be pounded against 



IN THE SHIELD 



145 




the wall; and the wall was worse 
for the wear too. Black Jack Buron- 
to, obviously, would not care if he 
killed a hundred men. A thousand. 
He turned to them and plodded 
through the mounting wreckage. 
Anything that was in his way, he 
tossed aside, knocking over tables, 
smashing chairs and lamps and ro- 
bo-tenders. He lashed out at Hur- 
kos, struck a blow that sent the 
small Mue tumbling across another 
table and crashing to the floor in a 
cloud of broken glass. 

Gnossos stepped up to take a 
swing at Buronto, but he was a 
Natural. It was impossible for him 
to strike out at a fellow man. Had 
Burohto been an animal, the case 
would have been simple. But he 
was not. And a thousand years of 
sanity made Gnossos check his 
blow even before he started it. Bur- 
onto delivered a punch that set the 
poet down hard. As Gnossos and 
Hurkos struggled to gain their feet. 
Black Jack heaved a table out of 
the way and came for Sam. 

And at that moment, the second 
hypnotic order came . 

A chaos of noise obliterated the 
noise in the bar.^ Sam’s eyes glossed. 
He wobbled for a moment, then de- 
terminedly set out for the door. 
Buronto, "seeing the move, snarled 
and leapt over fallen furniture, 
reaching the door first. ^^Not yet. I 
hurt you first 1” 

He reached for Sam with great 
hands . 



And suddenly doubled up as Sam 
struck him a blow in the stomach 
that would have crumbled a wall — 
because a wall would not have given 
as did Buronto’s stomach. And Bur- 
onto’s stomach certainly gave — 
gave up to Sam’s wrist. The giant 
oofed, stumbled, but still managed 
to clutch Sam’s shoulder. Sam 
brought up a foot, twisted away, 
and slammed the foot into Buron- 
to’s gut, sending him to his knees. 
Then he was past the Unnatural 
and through the door. 

After him I” Gnossos shouted. 
”He’s gotten another order!” The 
two of them ran past the gasping 
Buronto and outside. But in the 
dimness of the night, the streets 
were empty. Sam was already gone.

'^he water, chemicals, and lubri-

clothed the liquids rather than met-

one part of the giant mechanism to 
another, covering the block-by-

the Shield up, however, and it was 
frightening because it seemed so 
flimsy. Breadloaf knew that forces,

machines hummed. But what had he 
done before that? What would he 
do aect? 

Tkea chaos and noises came, 
swaSowing him . 

Wlien he came out, a package 
he bad been holding under his arm 
was gone. He did not know what 
he had done with it. Or what it 
had been. 

Then chaos and noises came, 

swallowing him . 

B readloaf rubbed fists in his eyes, 
pulled open a desk drawer 
and fumbled in it for anti-snooze 
tablets. He found the bottle, pop- 
ped two pills in his mouth, swal- 
lowed without benefit of water. Re- 
cappifig the bottle, he withdrew a 
secMd container of tiny nerve pills. 
He was in the process of swallow- 
ing one of these when the door flew 
off its hinges, crashed inward with 
a terr&le roar. There was a man 
standing there — eyes like vacant 
marbles — with his hands flung 
outward like the hands of a stage 
magician the tips of his fingers 
vibrating with' some hideous power. 

And from the nails came the 
darts. 

Needles of sleep. 

They bit into him spread their 
red warmth and pulled him into 
darkness before he could scream . 

T^^hen Sam was in control of his 
^ ^ body again, the first thing that 
struck his attention was the man 

148 



slumped in the chair behind the 
desk; the man was sitting in a re- 
laxed position but with every mus- 
cle taut in a sort of forced relaxa- 
tion. Secondly, there was the 
screen. It was to the side of him, 
and for a moment it had been in 
a low-key color series of magenta 
and black. But abruptly it spewed 
forth oranges and whites and 
creams that splashed across the 
room and grabbed his attention. 

He walked to the screen, stared 
into it. Something sent a chill up 
and down his spine. It was as if the 
colors were alive and wanted out. 

^^What do you want? Who are 
you?” 

The voice startled him, and he 
leaped, his heart pounding. But it 
had not been the colors; it had been 
the man. Sam turned and walked 
to the desk. ^^My name is Sam. 
I — ” 

^'What do you want? Why did 
you do this to me?” 

''Do what?” 

"I can^t move, damn you!” 

Sam hesitated, looked about the 
room, sensing a ghost scene of what 
had happened. "I paralyzed you.” 

Breadloaf ^s lips moved, and his 
eyes revolved like ball bearings 
in well-oiled grooves. "You — and 
the darts beneath your fingernails. 
What the Hell kind of man are 
you!” 

Sam lifted his hands and looked 
at them. The nails were discolored 
as if fine bits of flesh had puffed 

IF 




into ashes beneath them. He rubbed 
one, but the color was definitely 
not on the surface. 

^^What kind of a man are you?” 
Broadloaf roared this time, panic 
flashing through every word. 

don’t know,” Sam said final- 
ly. ^Hs there some way I can help 
you?” 

Breadloaf was breathing heavily. 
^^Yes. Go get helpl” 

”I can’t do that,” Sam said. He 
stood on the carpet, shuffling one 
foot over the other. 

^^Why? Why can’t you?” 

'Ht won’t let me.” 

<qt?” 

B riefly, he recounted his story — 
the jelly-mass, the hypnotic 
commands. When he finished, the 
other man’s eyes were wide — too 
wide to contain anything but hor- 
ror. ”The Prisoner,” he croaked. 
^^What?” 

^^The Prisoner of the Shield. You 
are under its direction I” 

Sam turned instinctively toward 
the portal of colors. '^Then they are 
alive!” 

Breadloaf was laughing, and Sam 
could not get him to stop. But nei- 
ther could he leave to get help. 
His feet would carry him toward 
the doorway but not through it. 
There was a block that kept him in 
the room — a mental block. His 
memory began to clear slightly, and 
he could remember what else he 
had done in this building. He had 



planted some sort of bomb in the 
machinery below. And it must be 
the machinery that kept the Shield 
going. 

”A thousand years,” Breadloaf 
shouted between whoops of laugh- 
ter. ^^For a thousand years it tried 
the same things, and we thought 
it was too dense to try anything 
Instead, it was pretending stupidity, 
making us lax. And it worked. Just 
when we’re feeling safe and se- 
cure — ” he burst into another fit 
of laughter. ”Just when we’re feel- 
ing secure, it takes you and breaks 
in with ridiculous ease.” He laugh- 
ed again, harshly. 

There was sweat on Sam’s upper 
lip. He wiped it off and became 
aware of sweat all over him. He 
was frightened. A thousand years 
had been as nothing to it. He shiv- 
ered, watching it. Were the colors 
its true appearance or merely the 
effects of it filtered by the Shield? 
A blue splotch of color rippled up 
from the bottom, seemed to form a 
question mark such as one would 
find no a large tronicsign — 

Tronicsign! 

He suddenly remembered seeing 
the huge tronicsign band that ran 
around all four sides of the Bread- 
loaf building with letters twenty 
feet high. Perhaps the control con- 
sole was up here. If it were, he 
could spell out a message for Gnos- 
sos and Hurkos. Surely they would 
be looking for him. And it was al- 
most a certainty they could see the 

149 



IN THE SHIELD 




towering tronicsign frem anywhere 
in this part of the city. If they were 
in this part of the city . 

^'The tronicsign controls/’ he said 
to Breadloaf. 

^^What?” 

^^The light letters. Where are the 
controls for the light letters?” 
^<Why — ” 

Where are they?” There was a 
tone of command in his voice that 
he had not known he possessed. 

There’s a master set in the main 
lounge, but I have a secondary plug- 
in set in the wall cabinet . — over 
there.” 

T Te found it, plugged it in, began 
^ typing out the message that 
the big boards would hold in glow- 
ing red?amber?blue? — letters. He 
decided on crimson words against a 
black background. GNOSSOS/ 
HURKOS . ^^What floor is 
this? he asked Breadloaf. 

^'Top.” 

TOP FLOOR. EXECUTIVE OF- 
FICE. COME QUICKLY. SAM 
There was a while to wait, and 
he paced the carpet. But they came. 
And they demanded explanations. 

He gave them the few he could, 
told them about the bomb planted 
below, the bomb that would wreck 
the machinery, shut down the 
Shield, and set the Prisoner free. 
He gave them the location of it, 
told them how to remove it and 
how to handle it — gently. And 
they ran to get it. They were gone 



what seemed like a very long time. 
Just when he was ready to count 
them as deserters, they returned 
with the bomb and the timer, carry- 
ing it like delicate crystal. 

Carefully, Sam disconnected the 
times, lift^ the halves of the cas- 
ing apart, and poured the volatile 
liquid out of the single window be- 
hind the desk. 

Four breaths were released simul- 
taneously when he turned and said, 
^Tt’s okay.” 

'^Then this is it I” Gnossos said, 
the first to recover completely. He 
paced back and forth, looking at 
the Shield. ^^This is the thing that 
has been directing you. But if it 
is trapped behind this Shield, how 
did it get to you to hypnotize you? 
And how did it whip up that jeUy- 
cored ship?” 

'T think I can shed some light 
on that,” Breadloaf said. He was 
still paralyzed, but his fingers were 
tingling, and he could move his 
thumbs. The effects were beginning 
to wear thin. 

They turned to him. Gnossos 
crossed the room. ''What light?” 

"He — ” Broadloaf began. 

"Sam,” Sam identified himself. 

"Yes. I think you are operating 
on a false assumption. The Prison- 
er did not ^get to’ Sam. He did not 
kidnap Sam. Sam is the Prisoner’s 
creation.” 

"Creation?” Gnossos snorted. 

"Yes. The Prisoner imagined 
Sam, built him into a concrete cn- 

IF 



150 




tity. Probably with a last burst of 
his energies.” 

"That^s absurd.” 

B readloaf tried to shake his head, 
only succeeded in making his 
lips quiver. ^'No. The Prisoner 
concentrated his efforts, summoned 
all his resources and shaped a man 
and a ship. The ship was not a ma- 
chine, for machines are alien to the 
Prisoner’s mind. In some places, 
the dimensions are rather close, due 
to the warping of the higher di- 
mension. Perhaps at one of these 
places he forced his thoughts 
through the thin barrier and made 
Sam and the ship.” 

^^But why not force himself 
through at one of these spots?” 
Hurkos asked. 

''He could not do that with 
what energies he has left. You see, 
he is much larger than the ship and 
Sam put together. He is ihe en- 
tire higher dimension^* 

"One creature is an entire dimen- 
sion?” 

Breadloaf coughed. "If that crea- 
ture is God, yes. And that is pre- 
cisely who the Prisoner is.” 

VIII 

44^ od!” Gnossos shouted. 

Hurkos wandered next to 
the Shield, pressed his face to it, 
looking into the colors that swirled, 
folded upon themselves and became 
new colors. Here, brought to him 



through modern science, was the 
thing that prayer could not 3 deld. 

"The Dreams,” Gnossos s^id, 
turning to look at the colors. "The 
dreams Hurkos took from it were 
the dreams of a paranoid, then; 
they were the dreams of a being 
obsessed by demon-persecution.” 
Sam’s mind was whirling too. 
"And the machines were not ma- 
chines at all, for God is not the 
father of machines. He is the father 
of life, the father of man who makes 
the machines. God could imitate 
the exterior of a machine, but the 
only way he could make it last 
was to create a life-form that could 
imitate the workings of one.” 
"And God feared machines be- 
cause they were something above 
his abilities. And he feared Mues 
and chose to ignore their existence 
because they were things beyond 
his powers — they were results 
of men usurping his rights.” 

"A thousand years,” Breadloaf 
said. 

"How could you stand it?” Gnosr- 
SOS asked, turning from the Shield. 
"How could you sit there, know- 
ing?” 

"Sometimes I thought I could 
never come back. But when I 
thought of how much worse it would 
be if he escaped — ” 

"Of course,” Gnossos said. "For 
a thousand years, men have grown 
gradually saner, have broken con- 
nections with their past history. 
It’s because he’s been trapped in 



IN THE SHIELD 



151 




your warped dimension and can’t 
influence anything. Isn’t that it?” 

B readloaf sighed. He was able to 
make fists of his hands, and 
he sat exercising them. ”Yes. My 
father thought he could enslave the 
Prisoner and make him work for 
the family. We knew who he was. 
He was no time at all in telling us, 
in demanding to be freed. But we 
could not master his powers and 
use them. Then it became clear that 
we could never let Him out. At 
first, of course, it was for the 
family’s safety. He would wipe 
out every Breadloaf if given a 
diance. Then, after a few hundred 
years, when we saw what the Fed- 
eration was becoming, how much 
better it seemed, we realized that 
much of the chaos of life had been 
God’s doing. We had even strong- 
reasons for keeping Him locked 
up. 

“If He ever is released — 
Breadloaf wriggled an arm at last. 
''War will come again, famine, pes- 
til^ce, and disease. We have no 
choice but to contain him.” 

''You have no choice but to re- 
lease him.” 

They turned toward the door. 
The man standing there was a 
Christian. There were a dozen oth- 
ers behind him — dirty, unshaven, 
dressed in rags of self-denial. One 
of them was the sign-carrier Gnos- 
sos had berated on the street. He 
was smiling now. He stepped into 



the room. "Strange who God should 
choose as His liberators.” 

"How did they — ” Breadloaf 
began. 

"I told them I” Sam shouted. 
The series of h)^notic orders flash- 
ed through his memory now. What 
God had ordered him to do was a 
breathing clarity. He recited the 
post-hypnotic commands that had 
followed the landing on Hope: 
"Find a temple and tell them that 
God is being held prisoner by the 
Breadloaf family in the Breadloaf 
building; I will give you flames 
upon your tongue as a sign to con- 
vince them. In the Sell-all Hardware 
store, purchase these chemicals and 
pieces of equipment — ester of 
glycerin, nitric acid, a watch, a 
spool of number twenty-six copper 
wire, and a small construction det- 
onator. Next, prepare a bomb of 
glyceryl trinitrate. Next, break into 
the Breadloaf Building, plant the 
bomb by a force pipe in the base- 
ment. Render Alexander Breadloaf 
helpless by drug darts.” He had 
told the Christians, then. They were 
here on his word. 

"It’s not your fault,” Gnossos 
said. 

Then the echo of an explosion 
rumbled through the floors of the 
buildings, shook the walls. The 
Christians were destro)dng the ma- 
chinery. 

A second explosion . 

And the Shield blinked . 

. Was gone . 



152 



IF 




B readloaf screamed a piercing 
scream, a thing that he had 
only half finished with when the 
black bird with the forty million 
eyes and the claws of brass swept 
from the vacant spot in the wall, 
swooped out on the cold winds and 
descended on him. The room had 
expanded, it seemed, to the size of 
a dozen galaxies. Yet all of it was 
filled with them and this thing 
from beyond their dimension so that 
it seemed — in another way — 
only as large as a small closet. 
There was no up nor down. 

The stars had lost their glitter. 
And the darkness ate the light. 
Sam was tumbling around yet 
within God, smashing against the 
pinions of the huge feathers, caught 
alternately in winds as cold as ice 
and as hot as volcano hearts. Now 
and then, as he fought the over- 
whelming expanses of blackness that 
clutched at him with a million oiled 
fingers, he saw Alex Breadloaf. He 
saw him first without skin — peel- 
ed and bloody. Then he saw him 
blackened and a thing of ash. He 
saw lightning flaring from charred 
nostrils and worms eating the man^s 
black tongue. He saw him undergo 
all the punishments of all imagined 
Hells. And he feared greatly the 
moment when God would turn upon 
the rest of them, come with claws 
and with fangs to eat out 
their livers with silver-plated teeth. 

There was no warmth; neither 
was their cold. 



And everywhere there was Fear. 

'T^hen, suddenly, there were words 
in his mind. The familiar tones 
of Hurkos. Listen. Listen, I can see 
him. I can see God. 

I can see him too, Sam’s thought 
screamed. 

No. I mean, I can see him with 
my psionic powers. There is noth- 
ing to him. He^s so damned small! 

Clarify yourself. This from Gnos- 
sos. 

He is puny. He is not this large 
or forceful. The room is not ex- 
panding. Breadloaf is not being 
charred or eaten. God is trying to 
frighten Breadloaf to death. Fear 
is the only weapon he has left. He 
has lost his greatest powers. Per- 
haps from years of confinement 
and the last surge of creating Sam 
he has drained himself. 

But all this, Sam thought. 

A damn fake. Til send you the 
true picture. Pm looking right 
through his illusions and delusions. 
I can see. Til broadcast. 

Abruptly the room was normal. 
Breadloaf was uncharred. But he 
was dead. His eyes were blank, 
fish-dead things. His hand clutch- 
ed his heart. The tiny transmitter 
in his chest would be yelling for 
the medics. He would be reached 
in time — here in the city — to 
be given a new heart before brain 
damage occurred. He would live 
again. 

Where — ” Gnossos began. 



IN THE SHIELD 



153 




Then they saw it. It was poised 
on the rim of the Shield itself. It 
was a small, pink, formless thing. 
It had not transferred itself because 
it was too big; it had created Sam, 
because Sam would be more effec- 
tive than it would have been in 
breaking down the Shield. For a 
moment, the dreams surged badr, 
but Hurkos fought them off. Then 
the Mue raised a chair, smashed it 
into the pink slug. Again, again, 
and again. He mashed with a fury 
Sam never guessed him to possess. 

And Hurkos killed God. 

B readloaf came through the door 
of the saloon, stopped a mo- 
ment to search them out, then 
smiled as he found them. Only 
three hours had passed since he had 
died, but he looked healthy and 
cheerful. More cheerful, in fact, 
than he had ever looked before. He 
made his way through the crowd 
to their table, sat down. passed 
the churdi on the way. The Chris- 
tians are moving out of their homes 
in the basement, bundles on their 
backs. In a way, it is a shame. Their 
lives have been nothing.” 

'^They can take the shots now,” 
Hurkos said. He was relaxed for 
the first time. He had gotten his 
revenge — more revenge than any 
man could hope for. Sam had won- 
dered, at first, if Hurkos could be 
deranged, for he had, after all, 
killed. But he had not lulled a man. 
What he had killed was a rung low- 



er than Man and, therefore, might 
be called an animal. ^'They can live 
eternally.” 

'^Some of them probably will. 
But they are old, remember. Fifty, 
some sixty, while the rest of us are 
thirty or under. It will not be ex- 
actly pleasant to be eternally old 
in a time of eternal youth.” 
^Tragic and ironic both,” Gnos- 
sos said, sipping his drink. ^'How 
do you feel?” 

Better than ever,” Breadloaf an- 
swered. 

guess so,” Hurkos said. 
^'Gnossos, I killed God tonight. 
How^s that for an epic poem?” 

”IVe been thinking,” the poet 
said. ^'But it would have been bet- 
ter if He had been a Goliath. There 
is nothing particularly heroic about 
smashing a helpless slug to pulp.” 
Sam finished his drink. ^^I’m go- 
ing for a walk,” he said standing. 

be back in a while.” Before 
anyone could speak, he turned for 
the door, struggling through the 
crowd, and stepped outside. Night 
was giving way to day; a toudi of 
golden dawn tinted the horizon al- 
ready. 

^^You all right?” Gnossos asked, 
stepping out beside him. 

'T’m not sick. Not exactly.” 
^^Yeah. Yeah, I know what you 
mean.” 

^^The purpose of life: to over- 
come your creator.” 

^^But what can a walk do? Me — 
I’m getting drunk.”

'"Yeah/^ Sam said d«wly. May-

he bound?

THE STEEL GENERAL 
(.Continued from page 98) 
which are being eaten by the ser- 
pents his fingers and who calls out 
oh god but conscience his father is 
birdheaded on the sky’s throne and 
weeping blood. Resign? Never I Go 
home? The red laughter comes as 
he strikes at the brotherfaced thing 
below. 

“Yield and diel” 

Then cast . 

... far forth 
. where Time is dust 
and days are lilies without num- 
ber .. 

and the night is a purple cocka- 
trice whose name is oblivion 
denied . 

He becomes a topless tree 
chopped through and f^ng. 

At the end of forever, he lies 
upon his back and stares up at the 
Prince Who is his Brother, standing 
at all heights with eyes that im- 
prison him. 

“I give you leave to depart now, 
brother, for I have beaten you fair- 
ly,” come the green words. 

Then Homs bows his head and 
the world departs and the old world 
comes again. 

“Brother, I wish you had slain 
me,” he says. 

“I cannot.” 

“Do not send me back with this 
kind of defeat upon me.” 

“What else am I to do?” 
“Grant me some measure of 
mercy. I know not what.” 

156 



“Then hear me and go with 
honor. Know that I would slay your 
father, but that 1 will spare him 
for yoiu: sake if he will but aid 
me when the time arises.” 

“What time?” 

“That is for him to decide.” 

“I do not understand.” 

“Of course not. But bear him the 
message, anyway.” 

U J) 

“Agreed?” 

“Agreed,” says Horus. 

When he regains his feet, he re- 
alizes that he is standing in the Hall 
of the Hundred Tapestries, and 
alone. But in that last, agonizing 
instant, he had learned a thing. 

He hastens to write it down. 

XIII 

CCV^here is Horus?” inquires 
Madrak. “He was here but 
a moment ago.” 

“He has gone home,” says the 
Prince, rubbing his shoulder. “Now 
let me name you my problem — ” 
‘^My name,” says Wakim, “give 
it to me. Now.” 

“Yes,” says the Prince, “I will 
give it to you. You are a part of 
the problem I was about to name.” 
“Now,” Wakim repeats. 

“Do you feel any different with 
those shoes upon your feet?” 

“Yes.” 

“How so?” 

“I don’t know. Give me my 
name.” 



IF 




“Give him the glove, Mairak.” 
“I don’t want a glove.” 

“Put it on, if you wish to know 
your name.” 

“Very well.” 

He dons the glove. 

“Now do you know your name?” 
“No. I — ” 

“What?” 

“It feels familiar, very familiar, 
to have the mesh spread across my 
body.” 

“Of course.” 

“It can’t bel” says Madrak. 
“No?” the Prince inquires. “Pick 
up that wand and hold it, Wakiim. 
Here, hang its sheath about your 
waist.” ^ 

“What are you doing to me?” 
“Restoring what is rightfully 
yours.” 

“By what right?” 

“Pick up the wand.” 

“I don’t want to I You can’t 
make me! You promised me my 
name. Say itl” 

“Not until you’ve picked up the 
wand.” 

The Prince takes a step toward 
Wakim. Wakim backs away. 

“No!” 

“Pick it upl” 

The Prince advances further. 
Wakim retreats. 

“I may notl” 

“You may.” 

“Something about it .... It is 
forbidden that I touch that instru- 
ment.” 

“Pick it up and you will learn 
THE STEEL GENERAL 



your name — your true name.” 
“I — No I I don’t want my name 
any morel Keep my namel” 

“You must pick it up.” 

“No!” 

“It is written that you must pick 
it up.” 

“Where? How?” 

“I have written it, I — ” 
“AnubisI” cries Wakim. “Hear 
my prayer! I call upon thee in all 
thy power! Attend me in this place 
where I stand in the midst of thy 
enemies! The one whom I must 
destroy is at hand! Aid me against 
him, as I offer him to thee!” 
Vramin encircles himself, Madrak 
and the General with elaborate 
spikes of green flame. 

The wall at Wakim’s back slowly 
dissolves and infinity is there. 

A rm hanging limp, dog-face jeer- 
ing, Anubis stares down. 
“Excellent, servant!” come the 
words. “You have found him, corn- 
ered him. But the final blow re- 
mains and your mission is done. Use 
the fugue!” 

“No,” says the Prince, “he will 
not destroy me, even with the fugue, 
while I have this thing for him. You 
recognized him when first you saw 
him, long ago. His true name is now 
near to his ears. He would hear it 
spoken.” 

“Do not listen to him, Wakim,” 
says Anubis. “Kill him now!” 
“Master, is it true that he knows 
my name? My real name?” 

T57 




“He lies! Slay him! Now!” 
“I do not lie. Pick up the wand 
and you will know the truth.” 
“Do not touch it! It is a trap! 
You will die!” 

“Would I go through all these 
elaborate motions to slay you in 
this manner, Wakim? Whichever of 
us dies at the hands of the other, 
the dog will win. He knows it, and 
he sent you to do a monstrous act. 
See how he laughs!” 

“Because I have won, Thoth! He 
comes to kill you now!” 

Wakim advances upon the Prince, 
then stoops and picks up the wand. 

He screams, and even Anubis 
draws back. 

Then the sound in his throat 
turns to laughter. 

He raises the wand. 

“Silence, dog! You have used 



me! Oh, how you have used me! 
You apprenticed me to death for a 
thousand years, that I might slay 
my son and my father without 
flinching. But now you look upon 
Set the Destroyer and your days are 
numbered!” His eyes glow through 
the mesh which covers his entire 
body, and he stands above the floor. 
A line of blue light lances from the 
wand that he holds, but Anubis is 
gone, faded with a quick gesture 
and an half-heard howl. 

“My son,” says Set, touching 
Thoth’s shoulder. 

“My son,” says the Prince, bow- 
ing his head. 

The spikes of green flame fall 
behind them. 

Somewhere, a dark thing cries out 
within the light, within the night.

IF • Special Feature 



AUWIIAPIIS 



We recently asked Roger Zelazny 
some questions about himself, his stories, 
his feelings about science fiction and 
the world. His responses were transcribed 
directly from the tape, without polishing 
or second thoughts. We think they are 
of interest to science-fiction readers, and 
we are pleased to present them here. 



T first got interested in science 
fiction with the Doctor Doo- 
little stories in the first or second 
grade; I was a fantasy fan when 
I was very young. Then, when I 
was in the sixth grade, I got hold 
of a book — I can’t think of the 
name of the author right now, but 
it was called The Angry Planet, I 
was eleven years old at the time. 
That was the first exposure I had 
to science fiction, and then I ran 
into a fellow who had also read it. 
We got to talking about it, and 
he said, “Gee, there’s lots of other 
good stuff in the school library,” so 
I went through the whole school 
science-fiction library shelves. I 
read all the Heinlein and every- 
thing else there. About two years 
later this fellow was in my same 
class, by which time I was reading 
science fiction in hard covers in 
the local library, and he told me 
about the magazines. I had never 
read any of them because I didn’t 




like the covers, they looked aw- 
fully garish. But he loaned me 
some and I read them, and as a re- 
sult I started buying them. Once 
you get interested in the science 
fiction magazines, of course, you 
read backwards as well as forwards 
So I started going around to all 
the bookstores. 

Then my friend — who was 
about fifteen years old at the time 
— sold a story to Ray Palmer. I 
looked at it and thought, gee, I 
can write better than he can. Pll 
try it. 

So I tried it, and I couldn’t do 
it. I got a bimch of rejection slips. 
I wrote about two hundred stories, 



159 





and every one of them was reject- 
ed. I was sixteen when I entered a 
National Scholastic high school 
story contest — Harlan Ellison 
also entered it; he won it in his 
time, and I sold them a story in 
mine. They paid me twenty-five 
bucks for it, and they printed it. 
That inspired me to go out and 
write about another hundred sto- 
ries. They were all rejected, but 
occasionally I’d get a little nice 
note. I had a sentence from Fletch- 
er Pratt once, saying try again. 
Ray Palmer dropped me a couple 
notes sa 3 ung, “Comes close this 
time,” “Didn’t quite make it.” Then 
I went to college and stopped writ- 
ing altogether; I had too many 
courses even to read science fic- 
tion. 

I went through college and grad 
school, and finished all my courses 
for my master’s degree, but I had 
to write a thesis before I could 
get it. It would take me about six 
months to write it, and I was afraid 
I’d be drafted in the meantime; so 
rather than writing my thesis, I 
joined the Army Reserve and serv- 
ed six months. After I got out I 
drew unemplo)mient compensation. 

You had to prove that you’d ask- 
ed for a job at least twice a week 
in order to get the check, so I’d 
call up a plant and say, “I’m after 
a graduate degree and I only want 
to work for a little while, but if 
you need a person with an English 
degree to work at your lumberyard 



I’d be glad to work for you. They 
would always say no and I’d put 
their names down in my little book. 

The third week, I think it was, 
I was running low on lumberyards 
so I tried Civil Service. I took the 
test, and unfortunately they gave 
me a job. 

In the meantime I’d finished my 
thesis and had it accepted, so all 
I had to do was wait for the next 
time to come around to take my 
tests and get my degrees. So I did 
that, and got it. 

Then, having the degree and the 
job, I decided that the one thing 
I’d really always wanted to do was 
to write. Thinking about the best 
way to break in I started reading 
again, out of the usual academic 
area; and I went back to science 
fiction. I figured I knew science 
fiction; I’d read thousands of sto- 
ries in the area; and since I had 
this much knowledge I might as 
well try science fiction. So I start- 
ed batting out stories, for about 
three months; and finally I sold 
one to Cele Goldsmith. I remem- 
ber the date of the first sale; it was 
very vivid. It was March 28th, 
1962. Before the year was up I’d 
sold seventeen stories. 

Stanley Weinbaum was my fav- 
orite science-fiction writer at first; 
then came Heinlein; when I got a 
little bit over him, I decided it was 
Sturgeon I liked best. I liked some 
of Ray Bradbury’s stuff. It’s 
a funny thing; I always used to 




loQk at the author’s name. But 
I’ve noticed that there are a lot 
ef people who, when you say, ^‘Who 
do you like?”, don’t remember any- 
thing but the story. 

Weinbaum’s characterization was 
something special. Just the way he 
treated man-woman relationships 
wasn’t like science-fiction stories 
prior to that time. Weinbaum had 
witty people, and his women were 
real people as well as his men; I 
thought that was important. Some 
•f his ideas were exciting, too; I 
must have read A Martian Odys- 
sty six or seven times. The Black 
Flame had one of the few female 
central diaracters that I thought 
was handled well; I haven’t read it 
for many years now, but it impress- 
ed me. 

In my own work, Lord of Light 
was a purposeful thing. I used va- 
rious mythologies; I like to take a 
mythology that hasn’t been used 
much in science fiction and see if 
I can satisfy both the science-fic- 
tion fan and the fantasy fan, 
throwing in enough fantasy to sat- 
isfy the fantasy fan and putting in 
enough the way of underpinnings 
to satisfy the science-fiction fan. 

The Creatures of Light and Dark- 
ness, on the other hand, is just a 
sort of a hobby story, a fun thing. 

I wanted to try every radical writ- 
ing technique I could think of at 
the moment and write a way out 
story. I really intended it to be a 
parody of what is sometimes refer- 

161 



red to as the “New Wave.” Prob- 
ably it won’t be considered that. I 
guess I’ve used up all the myth- 
ologies now. I’m going to try some- 
thing different next time. 

I liked Damnation Alley very 
much. I feel very comfortable with 
the “man against the elements” 
sort of theme; I was also very 
fond of Antoine de St. Exupery’s 
stories about the early days of air- 
plane traffic: Wind, Sand and Stars 
and Night Flight, I thought it 
would be nice to put something like 
that into a science-fiction setting, 
turning somebody loose against all 
the forces of nature. At the same 
time I had been thinking about 
anti-heroes; I considered using 
someone who had been sort of 
trapped into being a hero and reach- 
ed a point where he couldn’t turn 
back. I’ll probably do more of that 
kind in the future. 

I owe a debt to an English teach- 
er I once had named Ruby Olson. 
She was a fine woman who > knew a 
lot about writing, and she picked 
out about five kids who she 
thought showed some promise and 
tried to nurture this. 

Everything influences me. It us- 
ually shows up transmuted or 
changed into other forms in my 
stories, but I don’t think a good 
piece of fiction should really be 
pushing any particular position. 
I’m not too fond of the “thesis” 
type story. I’d rather write the 
story and let the moral follow.

Dear Editor: 

I think science fiction for many 
years has needed style such as the 
“New Wave” introduces. What real- 
ly matters anyway is how Life re- 
acts to itself. For the past few years 
a small number of science-fiction 
writers has really gone through some 
changes, seen and felt what the mind 
actually is; astronauts of inner space 
and science-fiction writers discovered 
they may have many more inner di- 
mensions to work with. And what 
you do is write about it. After all, 
the most mind-blowing alien is Man. 
— Bill Wolfenbarger, 602 West Hill, 
St., Neosho, Mr. 64850. 

• Correction: To science fiction, 
what really matters is how Life will 
react to itself. Or do all advocates of 
the “new” form really feel that 
man’s thinking must remain forever 
static? — Editors 

♦ ♦ * 

Dear Editor: 

Regarding the letters printed in 
Hue and Cry on the subject of Doc 
Savage Magazine^ the information so 
far printed is somewhat lacking in 
detail. There were exactly 18 i Doc 
Savage novels, written from March 



1933 to the last issue, dated Sum- 
mer 1949, in which the superhuman 
Doc Savage does battle against the 
minions of Satan himself. Of these, 
165 were penned by Lester Dent, who 
died in 1959. Dent created and de- 
veloped the character Doc Savage 
for Street & Smith Publications. Nine 
of the novels were done by Norman 
A. Danberg, four by Alan Hathway 
and three by onetime editor William 
G. Bogart. For most of the series. 
Dent was writing one Savage novel 
a month, and he turned out some 
fantastic material at that rate, always 
with a realistic background and style. 
All the stories were published under 
the house name of “Kenneth Robe- 
son”. Bantam Books is now reprint- 
ing the novels at the rate of one per 
month, with James E. Bama doing 
the covers. 

When are you going to publish 
another Berserker story? — Lohr 
McKinstry, 668 Park St., Blooms- 
burg, PA 17815. 

• And that should settle the issue of 
Doc Savage. Fred Saberhagen is 
busily at work on stories for us, and 
we hope to have more of his Ber- 
serker stories shortly. — Editor.
