THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man's mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women wh o pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

EDITOR’S 
NOTEBOOK - 



HONEST! 

S URELY From The Editor’s 
Notebook is the corniest of 
all titles for an editorial page ; 
yet we do have a notebook and 
we are an editor, and just this 
once we’ll let you peek. 

We wouldn’t begin to let 
you leaf through it. It isn’t 
that you might swipe our 
ideas, or that we jot down em- 
barrassing Secrets. It’s just 
that we’d hate to have to ex- 
plain to you why we bothered 
to record such-and-such a 
thought when we honestly 
don’t know ourselves. Some 
things, of course, are put 
down out of sheer self-defense 
— ideas which pop up unex- 
pectedly and demand to be 
pursued at a time when duty 
calls elsewhere. Writing them 
down can often drive them un- 
derground for the time being. 
And some, of course, are writ- 
ten there specifically because 
we want to share them with 
you. It’s good to dredge these 
out, for they often get per-

manently lost, awaiting a tie- 
in or a pile-on — some frame- 
work or lead-in to excuse their 
being immortalized on these 
pages. Well, the heck with a 
context. Take ’em as is. 

All the worlds love a lover. 
(Title?). Guy asks a robot, 
or ET, “How do you feel?” 
and gets a four-hour, lecture 
on esthesia... Why do bees 
hum? Because they don’t 
know the lyrics... A prize 
fight is in progress at the end 
of the world, watched only by 
a man alone in a fallout shel- 
ter. A completed engraving 
for a commemorative stamp 
exists in the philatelic vaults 
in Washington, made in 
spring 1914: “100 Years of 
Peace, 1814—1914.”... No one 
seems to have noticed the ex- 
traordinary skill and force 
exhibited in the way the 
shepherds’ part in the Nativity 
story is presented. The shep- 
herds (a) left their sheep (b) 
at night, in order to view the

Manger. You could juice up 
on applied psychology for 
forty years and never find a 
more powerful way to impress 
the uneducated pastoral mind 
as to the genuine wonder of 
an event. The story would be 
told and retold, not because 
they comprehended the hap- 
pening, but because these guys 
had done the unheard-of thing 
of leaving their flocks. It’s 
analagous to having a sur- 
geon leave the table in the 
middle of a brain opera-

toral planet, see. And the 
crew dress up like natives... 

Be Grown up or be Blown 
up... In Russian ‘"if” and 
“when” translate to the same 
word. Hey, could this be the 
real gimmick behind the Ber- 
lin crisis and these incredible 
deadlines Khrushchev sets and 
then backs off? Suppose he’s 
all the time saying “if I sign 
a treaty with East Germany 
in six months” and constantly 
gets translated “when I 
sign...”? Time travel story: 
smart guy buys up Cape Ca- 
naveral before base, is estab- 
lished, sits back to cash in. 
His smarter buddy won’t 
touch it: he buys the land all 
around it. When time comes, 
gov’t moves in, pays (via emi- 
nent domain) for squashy un- 
improved relatively useless 
swamp country, and pays pea- 
nuts. But the other guy makes 
nine fortunes on motel real es- 
tate, bars and trailer parks. 
Chalcedony is pronounced kal 



sed onee . “Here, therefore, 
is the greatest distemper of 
learning: when men study 
words, not matters.” — Francis 
Bacon... Genesis, Ch. 5, tells 
of Enoch (which means Man) 
who praised the Lord; and 
seems to imply that only with 
him did Man begin. Which in 
turn would imply that those 
who went before — Adam and 
Eve, Cain and Abel, were not 
human ! . Re Conscience* see 
1 Corinth. 29. (Now here’s a 
heck of a note in the note- 
book ! First Corinthians has 
only 16 chapters, Second Cor- 
inthians 13 chapters: what 
price Conscience?)... Make a 
fortune: by a piece of really 
nice woodland, fit it up with 
isolated tent sites, then install 
running water behind bushes, 
AC outlets in tree-roots, gas 
grates in open stone fire- 
places — everything really cam- 
ouflaged and concealed. Can’t 
imagine what sort of people 
you’d get for clients but bet 
they’d pay for it... Some 
medic has given a name to 
Fear of the Bomb: Nucleomi- 
trophobia. Seems sometimes 
as if the very people who were 
avoiding science fiction be- 
cause it was specious and com- 
ic-strippy are now staying 
away from it because it’s ’way 
over their heads... “It will 
ever remain incomprehensible 
that our generation, so great 
in its achievements of discov- 
ery, could be so low spiritual- 
ly as to give up thinking.”

AIDE 

MEMOIRE 



BY KEITH LAUMER 

A CROSS the table from Re- 
tief, Ambassador Magnan 
rustled a stiff sheet of parch- 
ment and looked grave 

“This aide memoire,” he 
said, “was just handed to me 
by the Cultural Attache. It's 
the third on the subject this 
week. It refers to the matter 
of sponsorship of Youth 
groups — ” 

“Some youths,” Retief said. 
“Average age, seventy-five.” 
“The Fustians are a long- 
live d people,” Magnan 
snapped. “These matters are 
relative. At seventy-five, a 
male Fustian is at a trying 
age — ” 

“That’s right. He’ll try any- 
thing — in the hope it will 
maim somebody.” 

“Precisely the problem,” 



The Fustians looked like 

turtles but they could 

move fast when they chose! 

ILLUSTRATED BY BURNS 



Magnan said. “But the Youth 
Movement is the important 
news in today’s political sit- 
uation here on Fust. And 
sponsorship of Youth groups 
is a shrewd stroke on the part 
of the Terrestrial Embassy. At 
my suggestion, well nigh eve- 
ry member of the mission has 
leaped at the opportunity to 
score a few p — that is, ce- 
ment relations with this emer- 
gent power group — the lead- 
ers of the future. You, Retief, 
as Councillor, are the out- 
standing exception.” 

“I’m not convinced these 
hoodlums need my help in or- 
ganizing their rumbles,” Re- 
tief said. “Now, if you have 
a proposal for a pest control 
group—” 

“To the Fustians this is no 



8 



jesting matter,” Magnan cut 
in. “This group—” he glanced 
at the paper — “known as the 
Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic 
Recreational Society, or 
SCARS for short, has been 
awaiting sponsorship for a 
matter of weeks now.” 

“Meaning they want some- 
one to buy them a clubhouse, 
uniforms, equipment and any- 
thing else they need to com- 
plete their sexual, cultural 
and athletic development,” 
Retief said. 

“If we don’t act promptly,” 
Magnan said, “the Groaci 
Embassy may well anticipate 
us. They’re very active here.” 
“That’s an idea,” said Re- 
tief. “Let ’em. After awhile 
they’ll go broke instead of 
us.” 

“Nonsense. The group re- 
quires a sponsor. I can’t actu- 
ally order you to step for- 
ward. However...” Magnan 
let the sentence hang in the 
air. Retief raised one eyebrow. 

“For a minute there,” he 
said, “I thought you were 
going to make a positive 
statement.” 

JJL^fAGNAN leaned back, lac- 
^•*ing his fingers over his 
stomach. “I don’t think you’ll 
find a diplomat of my experi- 
ence doing anything so 
naive,” he said. 

“I like the adult Fustians,” 
said Retief. “Too bad they 
have to lug half a ton of horn 
around on their backs. I won- 
der if surgery would help.” 
“Great heavens, Retief,” 
AIDE MEMOIRE 



Magnan sputtered. “I'm 
amazed that even you would 
bring up a matter of such deli- 
cacy. A race’s unfortunate 
physical characteristics are 
hardly a fit matter for Terres- 
trial curiosity.” 

“Well, of course your ex- 
perience of the Fustian men- 
tality is greater than mine. 
I’ve only been here a month. 
But it’s been my experience, 
Mr. Ambassador, that few 
races are above improving on 
nature. Otherwise you, for ex- 
ample, would be tripping over 
your beard.” 

Magnan shuddered. “Please 
— never mention the idea to 
a Fustian.” 

Retief stood. “My own pro- 
gram for the day includes 
going over to the dockyards. 
There are some features of 
this new passenger liner the 
Fustians are putting together 
that I want to look into. With 
your permission, Mr. Ambas- 
sador. ?” 

Magnan snorted. “Your pre- 
occupation with the trivial 
disturbs me, Retief. More in- 
terest in substantive matters 
— such as working with Youth 
groups — would create a far 
better impression.” 

“Before getting too in- 
volved with these groups, it 
might ’be a good idea to find 
out a little more about them,” 
said Retief. “Who organizes 
them? There are three strong 
political parties here on Fust. 
What’s the alignment of this 
SCARS organization?” 

“You forget, these are 

9 




merely teen-agers, so to 
speak/’ Magnan said. ‘‘Poli- 
tics mean nothing to them... 
yet.” 

“Then there are the Groaci. 
Why their passionate inter- 
est in a two-horse world like 
Fust? Normally they’re con- 
cerned with nothing but busi- 
ness. But what has Fust got 
that they could use?” 

“You may rule out the com- 
mercial aspect in this in- 
stance,” said Magnan. “Fust 
possesses a vigorous steel-age 
manufacturing economy. The 
Groaci are barely ahead of 
them.” 

“Barely,” said Retief. “Just 
over the line into crude atom- 
ics... like fission bombs.” 

Magnan shook his head, 
turned back to his papers. 
“What market exists for such 
devices on a world at peace? 
I suggest you address your at- 
tention to the less spectacular 
but more rewarding work of 
studying the social patterns of 
the local youth.” 

“I’ve studied them,” said 
Retief. “And before I meet 
any of the local youth social- 
ly I want to get myself a good 
blackjack.” 

II 

OETIEF left the sprawling 
^ bungalow-t y p e building 
that housed the chancery of 
the Terrestrial Embassy, 
swung aboard a passing flat- 
car and leaned back against 
the wooden guard rail as the 
heavy vehicle trundled 



through the city toward the 
looming gantries of the ship- 
yards. 

It was a cool morning. 
A light breeze carried the 
fishy odor of Fusty dwellings 
across the broad cobbled ave- 
nue. A few mature Fustians 
lumbered heavily along in the 
shade of the low buildings, 
audibly wheezing under the 
burden of their immense cara- 
paces. Among them, shell-less 
youths trotted briskly on 
scaly stub legs. The driver of 
the flat-car, a labor-caste Fus- 
tian with his guild colors em- 
blazoned on his back, heaved 
at the tiller, swung the un- 
wieldy conveyance through 
the shipyard gates, creaked to 
a halt. 

“Thus I come to the ship- 
yard with frightful speed,” he 
said in Fustian. “Well I know 
the way of the naked-backs, 
who move always in haste.” 

Retief climbed down, hand- 
ed him a coin. “You should 
take up professional racing,” 
he said. “Daredevil.” 

He crossed the littered yard 
and tapped at the door of a 
rambling shed. Boards creaked 
inside. Then the door swung 
back. 

A gnarled ancient with tar- 
nished facial scales and a 
weathered carapace peered out 
at Retief. 

“Long-may-you-sleep,” said 
Retief. “I’d like to take a look 
around, if you don’t mind. I 
understand you’re laying the 
bedplate for your new liner 
today.”

by Keith Laumer 




“May-you-d r c a m-of-the- 
deeps,” the old fellow mum- 
bled. He waved a stumpy arm 
toward a group of shell-less 
Fustians standing by a mas- 
sive hoist. “The youths know 
more of bedplates than do I, 
but who but tend the place of 
papers.” 

“I know how you feel, old- 
timer,” said Retief. “That 
sounds like the story of my 
life. Among your papers do 
you have a set of plans for the 
vessel? I understand it’s to 
be a passenger liner.” 

The oldster nodded. He 
shuffled to a drawing file, 
rummaged, pulled out a sheaf 
of curled prints and spread 
them on the table. Retief 
stood silently, running a fin- 
ger over the uppermost draw- 
ing, tracing lines. 

“What does the naked-back 
here?” barked a deep voice be- 
hind Retief. He turned. A 
heavy-faced Fustian youth, 
wrapped in a mantle, stood at 
the open door. Beady yellow 
eyes set among fine scales 
bored into Retief. 

“I came to take a look at 
your new liner,” said Retief. 

“We need no prying for- 
eigners here,” the youth 
snapped. His eye fell on the 
drawings. He hissed in sudden 
anger. 

“Doddering hulk!” he 
snapped at the ancient. “May 
you toss in nightmares! Put 
by the plans!” 

“My mistake,” Retief said. 
“I didn't know this was a se- 
cret project.” 

AIDE MEMOIRE 



T HE youth hesitated. “It is 
not a secret project,” he 
muttered. “Why should it be 
secret?” 

“You tell me.” 

The youth worked his jaws 
and rocked his head from side 
to side in the Fusty gesture of 
uncertainty. “There is nothing 
to conceal,” he said. “We 
merely construct a passenger 
liner.” 

“Then you don’t mind if I 
look over the drawings,” said 
Retief. “Who knows? Maybe 
some day I’ll want to reserve 
a suite for the trip out.” 

The youth turned and disap- 
peared. Retief grinned at the 
oldster. “Went for his big 
brother, I guess,” he said. “I 
have a feeling I won’t get to 
study these in peace here. 
Mind if I copy them?” 
“Willingly, light-f o o t e d 
one,” said the old Fustian. 
“And mine is the shame for 
the discourtesy of youth.” 
Retief took out a tiny cam- 
era, flipped a copying lens in 
place, leafed through the 
drawings, clicking the shutter. 

“A plague on these youths,” 
said the oldster, “who grow 
more virulent day by day.” 
“Why don’t you elders 
clamp down?” 

“Agile are they and we are 
slow of foot. And this unrest 
is new. Unknown in my youth 
was such insolence.” 

“The police — ” 

“Bah !” the ancient rumbled. 
“None have we worthy of the 
name, nor have we needed^ 
ought ere now.” 

1 1 




"What's behind it?" 

"They have found leaders. 
The spiv, Slock, is one. And 
I fear they plot mischief." He 
pointed to the window. "They 
come, and a Soft One with 
them.” 

Retief pocketed the camera, 
glanced out the window. A 
pale-featured Groaci with an 
ornately decorated crest stood 
with the youths, who eyed the 
hut, then started toward it. 

"That's the military attache 
of the Groaci Embassy," Re- 
tief said. "I wonder what he 
and the boys are cooking up 
together?" 

"Naught that augurs well 
for the dignity of Fust," the 
oldster rumbled. "Flee, agile 
one, while I engage their at- 
tentions." 

"I was just leaving," Retief 
said. "Which way out?" 

"The rear door," the Fustian 
gestured with a stubby mem- 
ber. "Rest well, stranger on 
these shores." He moved to the 
entrance. 

"Same to you, pop," said Re- 
tief. "And thanks." 

He eased through the nar- 
row back entrance, waited un- 
til voices were raised at the 
front of the shed, then strolled 
off toward the gate. 

T HE second dark of the 
third cycle was lightening 
when Retief left the Embassy 
technical library and crossed 
the corridor to his office. He 
flipped on a light. A note was 
tucked under a paperweight: 
"Retief — I shall expect 



your attendance at the IAS 
dinner at first dark of the 
fourth cycle. There will be a 
brief but, I hope, impressive 
Sponsorship ceremony for the 
SCARS group, with full press 
coverage, arrangements for 
which I have managed to com- 
plete in spite of your intran- 
sigence." 

Retief snorted and glanced 
at his watch. Less than three 
hours. Just time to creep 
home by flat-car, dress in cer- 
emonial uniform and creep 
back. 

Outside he flagged a lum- 
bering bus. He stationed him- 
self in a corner and watched 
the yellow sun, Beta, rise rap- 
idly above the low skyline. 
The nearby sea was at high 
tide now, under the pull of 
the major sun and the three 
moons, and the stiff breeze 
carried a mist of salt spray. 

Retief turned up his collar 
against the dampness. In half 
an hour he would be perspir- 
ing under the vertical rays of 
a third-noon sun, but the 
thought failed to keep the 
chill off. 

Two Youths clambered up 
on the platform, moving pur- 
posefully toward Retief. He 
moved off the rail, watching 
them, weight balanced. 

"That’s close enough, kids," 
he said. "Plenty of room on 
this scow. No need to crowd 
up." 

"There are certain films," 
the lead Fustian muttered. His 
voice was unusually deep for 
a Youth. Hq was wrapped in a 



12 



by Keith Laumer 




eavy cloak and moved awk- 
wardly. His adolescence was 
nearly at an end, Retief 
guessed. 

“I told you once,” said Re- 
tief. “Don’t crowd me.” 

The two stepped close, slit 
mouths snapping in anger. 
Retief put out a foot, hooked 
it behind the scaly leg of the 
overaged juvenile and threw 
his weight against the cloaked 
chest. The clumsy Fustian 
tottered, fell heavily. Retief 
was past him and off the flat- 
car before the other Youth had 
completed his vain lunge to- 
ward the spot Retief had occu- 
pied. The Terrestrial waved 
cheerfully at the pair, hopped 
aboard another vehicle, 
watched his would-be assail- 
ants lumber down from their 
car, tiny heads twisted to fol- 
low his retreating figure. 

So they wanted the film? 
Retief reflected, thumbing a 
cigar alight. They were a lit- 
tle late. He had already filed 
it in the Embassy vault, after 
running a copy for the refer- 
ence files. 

And a comparison of the 
drawings with those of the ob- 
solete Mark XXXV battle 
cruiser used two hundred 
years earlier by the Concordi- 
at Naval Arm showed them to 
be almost identical, gun em- 
placements and all. The term 
“obsolete” was a relative one. 
A ship which had been out- 
moded in the armories of the 
Galactic Powers could still be 
king of the walk in the 
Eastern Arm. 

AIDE MEMOIRE 



But how had these two 
known of the film? There had 
been no one present but him- 
self and the old-timer — and he 
was willing to bet the elderly 
Fustian hadn’t told them any- 
thing. 

At least not willingly. 

Retief frowned, dropped the 
cigar over the side, waited un- 
til the flat-car negotiated a 
mud-wallow, then swung 
down and headed for the ship- 
yard. 

T HE door, hinges torn 
loose, had been propped 
loosely back in position. Re- 
tief looked around at the bat- 
tered interior of the shed. 
The old fellow had put up a 
struggle. 

There were deep drag-marks 
in the dust behind the build- 
ing. Retief followed them 
across the yard. They disap- 
peared under the steel door of 
a warehouse. 

Retief glanced around. 
Now, at the mid-hour of the 
fourth cycle, the workmen 
were heaped along the edge of 
the refreshment pond, deep in 
their siesta. He took a multi- 
bladed tool from a pocket, 
tried various fittings in the 
lock. It snicked open. 

He eased the door aside far 
enough to enter. 

Heaped bales loomed before 
him. Snapping on the tiny 
lamp in the handle of the com- 
bination tool, Retief looked 
over the pile. One stack 
seemed out of alignment. 
and the dust had been scraped 

13 




from the floor before it. He 
pocketed the light, climbed up 
on the bales, looked over into 
a nest made by stacking the 
bundles around a clear spot. 
The aged Fustian lay in it, on 
his back, a heavy sack tied 
over his head. 

Retief dropped down inside 
the ring of bales, sawed at the 
tough twine and pulled the 
sack free 

“It’s me, old fellow,” Retief 
said. “The nosy stranger. Sor- 
ry I got you into this.” 

The oldster threshed his 
gnarled legs. He rocked 
slightly and fell back. “A 
curse on the cradle that 
rocked their infant slumbers,” 
he rumbled. “But place me 
back on my feet and I hunt 
down the youth, Slock, though 
he flee to the bottommost 
muck of the Sea of Torments.” 

“How am I going to get you 
out of here? Maybe I’d better 
get some help.” 

“Nay. The perfidious 
Youths abound here,” said the 
old Fustian. “It would be your 
life.” 

“I doubt if they’d go that 
far.” 

“Would they not?” The 
Fustian stretched his neck. 
“Cast your light here. But for 
the toughness of my hide. .” 

Retief put the beam of the 
light on the leathery neck. A 
great smear of thick purplish 
blood welled from a ragged 
cut. The oldster chuckled, a 
sound like a seal coughing. 

“Traitor, they called - me. 
For long they sawed at me — 



in vain. Then they trussed 
me and dumped me here. 
They tjiink to return with 
weapons to complete the 
task.” 

“Weapons? I thought it was 
illegal !” 

“Their evil genius, the Soft 
One,” said the Fustian. “He 
would provide fuel to the 
Devil himself.” 

“The Groaci again,” said 
Retief. “I wonder what their 
angle is.” 

“And I must confess. I told 
them of you, ere I knew their 
full intentions. Much can I 
tell you of their doings. But 
first, I pray, the block and 
tackle.” 

Retief found the hoist 
where the Fustian directed 
him, maneuvered it into posi- 
tion, hooked onto the edge 
of the carapace and hauled 
away. The immense Fustian 
rose slowly, teetered. .then 
flopped on his chest. 

Slowly he got to his feet. 

“My name is Whonk, fleet 
one,” he said. “My cows are 
yours.” 

“Thanks. I’m Retief. I’d 
like to meet the girls some 
time. But right now, let’s get 
out of here.” 

Whonk leaned his bulk 
against the ponderous stacks 
of baled kelp, bulldozed them 
aside. “Slow am I to anger,” 
he said, “but implacable in my 
wrath. Slock, beware !” 

“Hold it,” said Retief sud- 
denly. He sniffed. “What’s 
that odor?” He flashed the 
light around, played it over a 



14 



by Keith Laumer 




dry stain on the floor. He 
knelt, sniffed at the spot. 

“What kind of cargo was 
stacked here, Whonk? And 
where is it now?” 

Whonk considered. “There 
were drums,” he said. “Four 
of them, quite small, painted 
an evil green, the property of 
the Soft Ones, the Groaci. 
They lay here a day and a 
night. At full dark of the first 
period they came with steve- 
dores and loaded them aboard 
the barge Moss Rock ” 

“The VIP boat. Who’s 
scheduled to use it?” 

“I know not. But what mat- 
ters this? Let us discuss cargo 
movements after I have set- 
tled a score with certain 
Youths.” 

“We’d better follow this up 
first, Whonk. There’s only 
one substance I know of that’s 
transported in drums and 
smells like that blot on the 
floor. That’s titanite : the hot- 
test explosive this side of a 
uranium pile.” 

Ill 

B ETA was setting as Retief, 
Whonk puffing at his 
heels, came up to the sentry 
box beside the gangway lead- 
ing to the plush interior of the 
official luxury space barge 
Moss Rock. 

“A sign of the times,” said 
Whonk, glancing inside the 
empty shelter. “A guard 
should stand here, but I see 
him not. Doubtless he crept 
away to sleep.” 

1 * 



“Let’s go aboard and take a 
look around.” 

They entered the ship. Soft 
lights glowed in utter silence. 
A rough box stood on the 
floor, rollers and pry-bars be- 
side it — a discordant note in 
the muted luxury of the set- 
ting. Whonk rummaged in it. 

“Curious,” he said. “What 
means this?” He held up a 
stained cloak of orange and 
green, a metal bracelet, pa- 
pers. 

“Orange and green,” mused 
Retief. “Whose colors are 
those?” 

“I know not.” Whonk 
glanced at the arm-band. “But 
this is lettered.” He passed 
the metal band to Retief. 

“SCARS,” Retief read. He 
looked at Whonk. “It seems to 
me I’ve heard the name be- 
fore,” he murmured. “Let’s get 
back to the Embassy — fast.” 

Back on the ramp Retief 
heard a sound. .and turned in 
time to duck the charge of a 
hulking Fustian youth who 
thundered past him and 
fetched up against the broad 
chest of Whonk, who locked 
him in a warm embrace. 

“N ice catch, Whonk. 
Where’d he sneak out of?” 

“The lout hid there by the 
storage bin,” rumbled Whonk. 
The captive youth thumped 
fists and toes fruitlessly 
against the oldster’s carapace. 

“Hang onto him,” said Re- 
tief. “He looks like the biting 
kind.” 

“No fear. Clumsy I am, yet 
not without strength.” 

by Keith Laumer 




“Ask him where the titanite 
is tucked away.” 

“Speak, witless grub,” 
growled Whonk, “lest I tweak 
you in twain.” 

The youth gurgled. 

“Better let up before you 
make a mess of him,” said Re- 
tief. Whonk lifted the Youth 
clear of the floor, then flung 
him down with a thump that 
made the ground quiver. The 
younger Fustian glared up at 
the elder, mouth snapping. 

“This one was among those 
who trussed me and hid me 
away for the killing,” said 
Whonk. “In his repentance he 
will tell all to his elder.” 
“That’s the same young 
squirt that tried to strike up 
an acquaintance with me on 
the bus,” Retief said. “He gets 
around.” 

The youth scrambled to 
hands and knees, scuttled for 
freedom. Retief planted a foot 
on his dragging cloak; it 
ripped free. He stared at the 
bare back of the Fustian — 
“By the Great Egg!” 
Whonk exclaimed, tripping 
the refugee as he tried to rise. 
“This is no Youth! His cara- 
pace has been taken from 
him !” 

Retief looked at the scarred 
back. “I thought he looked a 
little old. But I thought — ” 
“This is not p o s s 1 b 1 e,” 
Whonk said wonderingly. 
“The great nerve trunks are 
deeply involved. Not even the 
cleverest surgeon could excise 
the carapace and leave the pa- 
tient living.” 

AIDE MEMOIRE 



“It looks like somebody did 
the trick. But let's take this 
boy with us and get out of 
here. His folks may come 
home.” 

“Too late,” said Whonk. Re- 
tief turned. 

Three youths came from be- 
hind the sheds. 

“Well,” Retief said. “It 
looks like the SCARS are out 
in force tonight. Where’s your 
pal?” he said to the advancing 
trio. “The sticky little bird 
with the eye-stalks? Back at 
his Embassy, leaving you 
suckers holding the bag, I’ll 
bet.” 

“Shelter behind me, Retief,” 
said Whonk. 

“Go get ’em, old-timer.” Re- 
tief stooped, picked up one of 
the pry-bars. “I’ll jump around 
and distract them.” 

Whonk let out a whistling 
roar and charged for the im- 
mature Fustians. They fanned 
out. .and one tripped, 
sprawled on his face. Retief 
whirled the metal bar he had 
thrust between the Fustian’s 
legs, slammed it against the 
skull of another, who shook 
his head, turned on Retief... 
and bounced off the steel hull 
of the Moss Rock as Whonk 
took him in full charge. 

Retief used the bar on an- 
other head. His third blow laid 
the Fustian on the pavement, 
oozing purple. The other two 
club members departed hasti- 
ly, seriously dented but still 
mobile. 

Retief leaned on his club, 
breathing hard. “Tough heads 



17 




these kids have got. I’m tempt- 
ed to chase those two lads 
down, but I’ve got another er- 
rand to run. I don’t know who 
the Groaci intended to blast, 
but I have a sneaking sus- 
picion somebody of impor- 
tance was scheduled for a boat 
ride in the next few hours. 
And three drums of titanite is 
enough to vaporize this tub 
and everyone aboard her.” 

“The plot is foiled,” said 
Whonk. “But what reason did 
they have?” 

“The Groaci are behind it. I 
have an idea the SCARS 
didn’t know about this gam- 
bit” 

“Which of these is the lead- 
er?” asked Whonk. He prod- 
ded a fallen Youth with a 

horny toe. “Arise, dreaming 

_ »» 
one. 

“Never mind him, Whonk. 
We’ll tie these two up and 
leave them here. I know where 
to find the boss.” 

A stolid crowd filled the 
low-ceilinged banquet 
hall. Retief scanned the ta- 
bles for the pale blobs of Ter- 
restrial faces, dwarfed by the 
giant armored bodies of the 
Fustians. Across the room 
Magnan fluttered a hand. Re- 
tief headed toward him. A 
low-pitched vibration filled 
the air: the rumble of subson- 
ic Fustian music. 

Retief Blid into his place be- 
side Magnan. “Sorry to be 
late, Mr. Ambassador.” 

“I’m honored that you chose 
to appear at all,” said Magnan 



coldly. He turned back to the 
Fustian on his left. 

“Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,” he 
said. “Charming, most charm- 
ing. So joyous.” 

The Fustian looked at him, 
beady-eyed. “It is the Lament 
of Hatching ” he said; “our 
National Dirge.” 

“Oh,” said Magnan. “How 
interesting. Such a pleasing 
balance of instruments — ” 

“It is a droon solo,” said the 
Fustian, eyeing the Terrestri- 
al Ambassador suspiciously. 

“Why don’t you just admit 
you can’t hear it,” Retief 
whispered loudly. “And if I 
may interrupt a moment — ” 
Magnan cleared his throat. 
“Now that our Mr. Retief has 
arrived, perhaps we could rush 
right along to the Sponsor- 
ship ceremonies.” 

“This group,” said Retief, 
leaning across Magnan, “the 
SCARS. How much do you 
know about them, Mr. Minis- 
ter?” 

“Nothing at all,” the huge 
Fustian elder rumbled. “For 
my taste, all Youths should be 
kept penned with the live- 
stock until they grow a cara- 
pace to tame their irresponsi- 
bility.” 

“We mustn’t lose sight of 
the importance of channeling 
youthful energies,” said Mag- 
nan. 

“Labor gangs,” said the 
minister. “In my youth we 
were indentured to the 
dredge-masters. I myseif drew 
a muck sledge.” 

“But in these modern 



18 



by Keith Leumer 




times, ” put in Magnan, “sure- 
ly it’s incumbent on us to 
make happy these golden 
hours.” 

The minister snorted. “Last 
week I had a golden hour. 
They set upon me and pelted 
me with overripe stench- 
fruit.” 

“But this was merely a 
manifestation of normal 
youthful frustrations,” cried 
Magnan. “Their essential ten- 
derness — ” 

“You’d not find a tender 
spot on that lout yonder,” the 
minister said, pointing with a 
fork at a newly arrived Youth, 
“if you drilled boreholes and 
blasted.” 

« W HY, that’s our guest of 
▼Y honor,” said Magnan, 
“a fine young fellow! Slop I 
believe his name is,” 

“Slock,” said Retief. “Eight 
feet of armor-plated orneri- 
ness. And — ” 

Magnan rose and tapped on 
his glass. The Fustians winced 
at the, to them, supersonic vi- 
brations. They looked at each 
other muttering. Magnan 
tapped louder. The Minister 
drew in his head, eyes closed. 
Some of the Fustians rose, tot- 
tered for the doors; the noise 
level rose. Magnan redoubled 
his efforts. The glass broke 
with a clatter and green wine 
gushed on the tablecloth. 

“What in the name of the 
Great Egg!” the Minister mut- 
tered. He blinked, breathing 
deeply. 

“Oh, forgive me,” blurted 

AIDE MEMOIRE 



Magnan, dabbing at the wine. 

“Too bad the glass gave 
out,” said Retief. “In another 
minute you’d have cleared the 
hall. And then maybe I could 
have gotten a word in side- 
ways. There’s a matter you 
should know about — ” 

“Your attention, please,” 
Magnan said, rising. “I see 
that our fine young guest has 
arrived, and I hope that the 
remainder of his committee 
will be along in a moment. It 
is my pleasure to announce 
that our Mr. Retief has had 
the good fortune to win out in 
the keen bidding for the pleas- 
ure of sponsoring this lovely 
group.” 

Retief tugged at Magnan’s 
sleeve. “Don’t introduce me 
yet,” he said. “I want to ap- 
pear suddenly. More dramatic, 
you know.” 

“Well,” murmured Magnan, 
glancing down at Retief, “I’m 
gratified to see you entering 
into the spirit of the event at 
last.” He turned his attention 
back to the assembled guests. 
“If our honored guest will 
join me on the rostrum...?” 
he said. “The gentlemen of the 
press may want to catch a few 
shots of the presentation.” 

Magnan stepped up on the 
low platform at the center of 
the wide room, took his place 
beside the robed Fustian 
youth and beamed at the 
cameras. 

“How gratifying it is to 
take this opportunity to ex- 
press once more the great 
pleasure^we have in sponsor- 

19 




ing SCARS,” he said, talking 
slowly for the benefit of the 
scribbling reporters. “We’d 
like to think that in our mod- 
est way we're to be a part of 
ill that the SCARS achieve 
during the years ahead.” 

Magnan paused as a huge 
Fustian elder heaved his bulk 
up the two low steps to the 
rostrum, approached the guest 
of honor. He watched as the 
newcomer paused behind 
Sl6ck, who did not see the 
new arrival. 

Retief pushed through the 
crowd, stepped up to face the 
Fustian youth. Slock stared at 
him, drew back. 

“You know me, Slock,” said 
Retief loudly. “An old fellow 
named Whonk told you about 
me, just before you tried to 
saw his head off, remember? 
It was when I came out to 
take a look at that battle cruis- 
efr you’re building/' 

' - * IV 

W ITH a bellow Slock 
reached for Retief— and 
choked off in mid-cry as the 
Fustian elder, Whonk, pin- 
ioned him from behind, lift- 
ing him clear of the floor. 

“Glad you reporters hap- 
pened along,” said Retief to 
the gaping newsmen. “Slock 
here had a deal with a sharp 
operator from the Groaci Em- 
bassy. The Groaci were to 
supply the necessary hardware 
and Slock, as foreman at the 
shipyards, was to see that 
everything was properly in- 



stalled. The next step, I as- 
sume, would have been a local 
take-over, followed by a little 
interplanetary war on Fla- 
menco or one of the other 
nearby worlds. .for which the 
Groaci would be glad to sup- 
ply plenty of ammo.” 

Magnan found his tongue. 
“Are you mad, Retief?” he 
screeched. “This group was 
vouched for by the Ministry 
of Youth !” 

“The Ministry's overdue for 
a purge,” snapped Retief. He 
turned back to Slock. “I won- 
der if you were in on the lit- 
tle diversion that was planned 
for today. When the Moss 
Rock blew, a variety of clues 
were to be planted where 
they’d be easy to find... with 
SCARS written all over them. 
The Groaci would thus have 
neatly laid the whole affair 
squarely at the door of the 
Terrestrial Embassy. .whose 
sponsorship of the SCARS 
had received plenty of pub- 
licity.” 

“The Moss Rock?” said 
* Magnan. “But that was — Re- 
tief! This is idiotic. Slock 
himself was scheduled to go 
on a cruise tomorrow!” 

Slock roared suddenly, 
twisting violently. Whonk 
teetered, his grip loosened... 
and Slock pulled free and was 
off the platform, butting his 
way through the milling old- 
sters on the dining room 
floor. Magnan watched, open- 
mouthed. 

“The Groaci were playing a 
double game, as usual,” Retief 



20 



by Keith Laumer 




said. “They intended to dis- 
pose of this fellow Slock, once 
he’d served their purpose.” 

“Well, don’t stand there,” 
yelped Magnan over the up- 
roar. “If Slock is the ring- 
leader of a delinquent 
gang. !” He moved to give 
chase. 

Retief grabbed his arm. 
“Don’t jump down there! 
You’d have as much chance of 
getting through as a jack- 
rabbit through a threshing 
contest.” 

Ten minutes later the crowd 
had thinned slightly. “We can 
get through now,” Whonk 
called. “This way/” He low- 
ered himself to the floor, 
bulled through to the exit. 
Flashbulbs popped. Retief and 
Magnan followed in Whonk’s 
wake. 

In the lounge Retief 
grabbed the phone, waited for 
the operator, gave a code let- 
ter. No reply. He tried anoth- 
er. 

“No good,” he said after a 
full minute had passed. “Won- 
der what’s loose?” He 
slammed the phone back in its 
niche. “Let’s grab a cab.” 

I N the street the blue sun, 
Alpha, peered like an arc 
light under a low cloud layer, 
casting flat shadows across 
the mud of the avenue. The 
three mounted a passing flat- 
car. Whonk squatted, resting 
the weight of his immense 
shell on the heavy plank floor- 
ing. 

“W o u 1 d that I too could 

AIDE MEMOIRE 



lose this burden, as has the 
false youth we bludgeoned 
aboard the Moss Rock ” he 
sighed. “Soon will I be forced 
into retirement. Then a mere 
keeper of a place of papers 
such as I will rate no more 
than a slab on the public 
strand, with once-daily feed- 
ings. And even for a man of 
high position, retirement is no 
pleasure. A slab in the Park 
of Monuments is little better. 
A dismal outlook for one’s 
next thousand years!” 

“You two carry on to the 
police station,” said Retief. “I 
want to play a hunch. But 
don’t take too long. I may be 
painfully right.” 

“What — ?” Magnan started. 

“As you wish, Retief,” said 
Whonk. 

The flat-car trundled past 
the gate to the shipyard and 
Retief jumped down, headed 
at a run for the VIP boat. The 
guard post still stood vacant. 
The two Youths whom he 
and Whonk had left trussed 
were gone. 

“That’s the trouble with a 
peaceful world,” Retief mut- 
tered. “No police protection.” 
He stepped down from the 
lighted entry and took up a 
position behind the sentry 
box. Alpha rose higher, shed- 
ding a glaring blue-white 
light without heat. Retief 
shivered. Maybe he’d guessed 
wrong. 

There was a sound in the 
near distance, like two ele- 
phants colliding. 

Retief looked toward the 

21 




gate. His giant acquaintance, 
Whonk, had reappeared and 
was grappling with a hardly 
less massive opponent. A small 
figure became visible in the 
melee, scuttled for the gate. 
Headed off by the battling ti- 
tans, he turned and made for 
the opposite side of the ship- 
yard. Retief waited, jumped 
out and gathered in the flee- 
ing Groaci. 

“Well, Yith,” he said, 
“how’s tricks? You should 
pardon the expression.” 

“Release me, Retief !” the 
pale-featured alien lisped, his 
throat bladder pulsating in 
agitation. “The behemoths vie 
for the privilege of dismem- 
bering me out of hand !” 

“I know how they feel. I’ll 
see what I can do... for a 
price.” 

“I appeal to you,” Yith 
whispered hoarsely. “As a 
fellow diplomat, a fellow ali- 
en, a fellow soft-back — ” 
“Why don’t you appeal to 
Slock, as a fellow skunk?” 
said Retief. “Now keep quiet 
. .and you may get out of this 
alive.” 

The heavier of the two 
struggling Fustians threw the 
other to the ground. There 
was another brief flurry, and 
then the smaller figure was on 
its back, helpless. 

“That’s Whonk, still on his 
feet,” said Retief. “I wonder 
who he’s caught — and why.” 
Whonk came toward the 
Moss Rock dragging the su- 
pine Fustian, who kicked 
vainly. Retief thrust Yith 



down well out of sight behind 
the sentry box. “Better sit 
tight, Yith. Don’t try to sneak 
off; I can outrun you. Stay 
here and I’ll see what I can 
do.” He stepped out and 
hailed Whonk. 

Puffing like a steam engine 
Whonk pulled up before him. 
“Sleep, Retief!” He panted. 
“You followed a hunch; I did 
the same. I saw something 
strange in this one when we 
passed him on the avenue. I 
watched, followed him here. 
Look! It is Slock, strapped 
into a dead carapace! Now 
many things become clear.” 

R ETIEF whistled. “So the 
Youths aren’t all as young 
as they look. Somebody’s been 
holding out on the rest of you 
Fustians!” 

“The Soft One,” Whonk 
said. “You laid him by the 
heels, Retief. I saw. Produce 
him now.” 

“Hold on a minute, Whonk. 
It won’t do you any good 
Whonk winked broadly. “I 
must take my revenge !” he 
to—” 

roared. “I shall test the tex- 
ture of the Soft One! His 
pulped remains will be 
scoured up by the ramp-wash- 
ers and mailed home in bot- 
tles!” 

Retief whirled at a sound, 
caught up with the scuttling 
Yith fifty feet away, hauled 
him back to Whonk. 

“It’s up to you, Whonk,” he 
said. “I know how important 
ceremonial revenge is to you 



22 



by Keith Laumer 




Fustians. I will not interfere.” 
“Mercy!” Yith hissed, eye- 
stalks whipping in distress. “I 
claim diplomatic immunity!” 
“No diplomat am I,” rum- 
bled W h o n k. “Let me see ; 
suppose I start with one of 
those obscenely active 
eyes — ” He reached... 

“I have an idea,” said Retief 
brightly. “Do you suppose — 
just this once — you could 
forego the ceremonial revenge 
if Yith promised to arrange 
for a Groaci Surgical Mission 
to de-carapace you elders?” 
“But,” Whonk protested, 
“those eyes! What a pleasure 
to pluck them, one by one!” 
“Yess,” hissed Yith, “I 
swear it ! Our most expert sur- 
geons ...platoons of them, 
with the finest of equipment.” 
“I have dreamed of how it 
would be to sit on this one, to 
feel him squash beneath my 
bulk. .” 

“Light as a whissle feather 
shall you dance,” Yith whis- 
pered. “Shell-less shall you 
spring in the joy of renewed 
youth — ” 

“Maybe just one eye,” said 
Whonk grudgingly. “That 
would leave him four.” 

“Be a sport,” said Retief. 
“Well.” 

“It's a deal then,” said Re- 
tief. “Yith, on your word as a 
diplomat, an alien, a soft-back 
and a skunk, you’ll set up the 
mission. Groaci surgical skill 
is an export that will net you 
more than armaments. It will 
be a whissle feather in your 
cap— if you bring it off. And 

AIDE MEMOIRE 



in return, Whonk won’t sit on 
you. And I won’t prefer 
charges of interference in the 
internal affairs of a free 
world.” 

Behind Whonk there was a 
movement. Slock, wriggling 
free of the borrowed cara- 
pace, struggled to his feet, .> 
in time for Whonk to seize 
him, lift him high and head 
for the entry to the Moss 
Rock . 

“H e y,” Retief called. 
“Where are you going?” 

“I would not deny this one 
his reward,” called Whonk. 
“He hoped to cruise in luxury. 
So be it.” 

“Hold on,* said Retief. 
“That tub is loaded with ti- 
tanite !” 

“Stand not in my way, Re- 
tief. For this one in truth 
owes me a vengeance.” 

Retief watched as the im- 
mense Fustian bore his giant 
burden up the ramp and dis- 
appeared within the ship. 

“I guess Whonk means busi- 
ness,” he said to Yith, who 
hung in his grasp, all five eyes 
goggling. “And he’s a little 
too big for me to stop.” 

Whonk reappeared, alone, 
climbed down. 

“What did you do with 
him?” said Retief. “Tell him 
you were going to — ” 

“We had best withdraw,” 
said Whonk, “The killing 
radius of the drive is fifty 
yards.” 

“You mean — ” 

“The controls are set for 
Groaci. Long-may-he-sleep.”

(ITT was quite a bang/’ said 

-■-Retief. “But I guess you 
saw it, too.” 

“No, confound it,” Magnan 
said. “When I remonstrated 
with Hulk, or Whelk—” 

“Whonk.” 

“ — the ruffian thrust me 
into an alley bound in my 
own cloak. I’ll most certainly 
complain to the Minister.” 

“How about the surgical 
mission?” 

“A most generous offer,” 
said Magnan. “Frankly, I was 
astonished. I think perhaps 
we’ve judged the Groaci too 
harshly.” 

“I hear the Ministry of 
Youth has had a rough morn- 
ing of it,” said Retief. “And a 
lot of rumors are flying to the 
effect that Youth Groups are 
on the way out.” 

Magnan cleared his throat, 
shuffled papers. “I — ah — have 
explained to the press that 
last night’s — ah — ” 

“Fiasco.” 

“ — affair was necessary in 
order to place the culprits in 
an untenable position. Of 
course, as to the destruction 
of the VIP vessel and the pre- 
sumed death of, uh, Slop.” 

“The Fustians understand,” 
said Retief. “Whonk wasn’t 
k i d d i n g about ceremonial 
vengeance.” 

“The Groaci had been guilty 
of gross misuse of diplomatic 
privilege,” said Magnan. “I 
think that a note — or perhaps 
an Aide Memoire: less for- 
mal ...” 

“The Moss Rock was bound 



for Groaci,” said Retief. “She 
was already in her transit or- 
bit when she blew. The major 
fragments will arrive on 
schedule in a month or so. It 
should provide quite a meteor- 
ite display. I think that should 
be all the aide the Groaci’s 
memoires will need to keep 
their tentacles off Fust.” 

“But diplomatic usage — ” 
“Then, too, the less that’s 
put in writing, the less they 
can blame you for, if anything 
goes wrong.” 

“That’s true,” said Magnan, 
lips pursed. “Now you’re 
thinking constructively, Re- 
tief. We may make a diplomat 
of you yet.” He smiled ex- 
pansively. 

“Maybe. But I refuse to let 
it depress me.” Retief stood 
up. “I’m taking a few weeks 
off... if you have no objec- 
tion, Mr. Ambassador. My pal 
Whonk wants to show me an 
island down south where the 
fishing is good.” 

“But there are some ex- 
tremely important matters 
coming up,” said Magnan. 
“We’re planning to sponsor 
Senior Citizen Groups — ” 
“Count me out. All groups 
give me an itch.” 

“Why, what an astonishing 
remark, Retief! After all, we 
diplomats are ourselves a 
group.” 

“Uh-huh,” Retief said. 
Magnan sat quietly, mouth 
open, and watched as Retief 
stepped into the hall "and 
closed the door gently behind 
him. END

IF • Short Story 



The aliens relished human ways. 

Unfortunately, the humans relished them too! 

from gustible’s 

planet 

BY CORDWAINER SMITH 



S HORTLY after the celebra- 
tion of the four thousandth 
anniversary of the opening of 
space, Angary J. Gustible dis- 
covered Gustible’s planet. 

The discovery turned out to 
be a tragic mistake. 

Gustible’s planet was inhab- 
ited by highly intelligent life- 
forms. They had moderate 
telepathic powers. They im- 
mediately mind-read Angary 
J. Gustible’s entire mind and 
life history, and embarrassed 
him very deeply by making up 
an opera concerning his recent 
divorce. 

The climax of the opera por- 
trayed his wife throwing a 
teacup at him. This created 
an unfavorable impression 
concerning Earth culture, and 
Angary J. Gustible, who held 

FROM GUSTIBLE’S PLANET 



a reserve commission as a Sub- 
chief of the Instrumentality, 
was profoundly embarrassed 
to find that it was not the 
higher realities of Earth 
which he had conveyed to 
these people, but the unpleas- 
ant intimate facts. 

As negotiations proceeded, 
other embarrassments devel- 
oped. 

In physical appearance the 
inhabitants of Gustible’s plan- 
et, who called themselves Api- 
cians, resembled nothing more 
than oversize ducks, ducks 
four feet to four feet six in 
height. At their wing tips, 
they had developed juxta- 
posed thumbs. They were pad- 
dle-shaped and sufficed to 
feed the Apicians. 

Gustible’s planet matched 

25 





Earth in several respects: in 
the dishonesty of the inhab- 
itants, in their enthusiasm for 
good food, in their instant ca- 
pacity to understand the hu- 
man mind. Before Gustible be- 
gan to get ready to go back 
to Earth, he discovered that 
the Apicians had copied his 
ship. There was no use hiding 
this fact. They had copied it 
in such detail that the dis- 
covery of Gustiblc’s planet 
meant the simultaneous dis- 
covery of Earth. 

By the Apicians. 

T HE implications of this 
tragic development did 
not show up until the Api- 
cians followed him home. 
They had a pianoforming ship 
capable of traveling in non- 
space just as readily as his. 

The most important feature 
of Gustible’s planet was its 
singularly close match to the 
biochemistry of Earth. The 
Apicians were the first intelli- 
gent life-forms ever met by 
human beings who were at 
once capable of smelling and 
enjoying everything which 
human beings smelled and en- 
joyed, capable of following 
any human music with forth- 
right pleasure and capable of 
eating and drinking every- 
thing in sight. 

The very first Apicians on 
Earth were greeted by some- 
what alarmed ambassadors 
who discovered that an appe- 
tite for Munich beer, Camem- 
bert cheese, tortillas and en- 
chiladas, as well as the better 



grades of chow mein, far 
transcended any serious cul- 
tural, political or strategic in- 
terests which the new visitors 
might have. 

Arthur Djohn, a Lord of the 
Instrumentality who was act- 
ing for this particular matter, 
delegated an Instrumentality 
agent named Calvin Dredd as 
the chief diplomatic officer of 
Earth to handle the matter. 

Dredd approached one 
Schmeckst, who seemed to be 
the Apician leader. The inter- 
view was an unfortunate one. 

Dredd began by saying, 
“Your Exalted Highness, we 
are delighted to welcome you 
to Earth — ” 

Schmeckst said, “Are those 
edible ?” and proceeded to eat 
the plastic buttons from Cal- 
vin Dredd’s formal coat, even 
before Dredd could say 
though not edible they were 
attractive. 

Schmeckst said, “Don’t try 
to eat those, they are really 
not very good.” 

Dredd, looking at his coat 
sagging wide open, said, “May 
I offer you some food?’’ 

Schmeckst said, “Indeed, 
yes.’’ 

And while Schmeckst ate an 
Italian dinner, a Peking din- 
ner, a red-hot peppery 
Szechuanese dinner, a Japa- 
nese sukiyaki dinner, two 
British breakfasts, a smorgas- 
bord and four complete serv- 
ings of diplomatic-level Rus- 
sian zakouska, he listened to 
the propositions of the Instru- 
mentality of Earth. 



26 



by Cordwainer Smith 




T HESE did not impress 
him. Schmeckst was intel- 
ligent despite his gross and 
offensive eating habits. He 
pointed out: “We two worlds 
are equal in weapons. We 
can’t fight. Look,” said he to 
Calvin Dredd in a threaten- 
ing tone. 

Calvin Dredd braced him- 
self, as he had learned to do. 
Schmeckst also braced him. 

For an instant Dredd did 
not know what had happened. 
Then he realized that in put- 
ting his body into a rigid and 
controlled posture he had 
played along with the low 
grade but manipulable tele- 
pathic powers of the visitors. 
He was frozen rigid till 
Schmeckst laughed and re- 
leased him. 

Schmeckst said, “You see, 
we are well matched. I can 
freeze you. Nothing short of 
utter desperation could get 
you out of it. If you try to 
fight us, we’ll lick you. We 
are going to move in here and 
live with you. We have 
enough room on our planet. 
You can come and live with 
us too. We would like to hire 
a lot of those cooks of yours. 
You’ll simply have to divide 
space with us, and that’s all 
there is to it.” 

That really was all there 
was to it. Arthur Djohn re- 
ported back to the Lords of 
the Instrumentality that, for 
the time being, nothing could 
be done about the disgusting 
people from Gustible’s plan- 
et. 



They kept their greed with- 
in bounds — by their stand- 
ards. A mere seventy-two 
thousand of them swept the 
earth, hitting every wine 
shop, dining hall, snack bar, 
soda bar and pleasure center 
in the world. They ate pop- 
corn, alfalfa, raw fruit, live 
fish, birds on the wing, pre- 
pared foods, cooked and 
canned foods, food concen- 
trates and assorted medicines. 

Outside of an enormous ca- 
pacity to hold many times 
what the human body could 
tolerate in the way of food, 
they showed very much the 
same effects as persons. Thou- 
sands of them got various 
local diseases, sometimes 
called by such undignified 
names as the Yangtze rapids, 
Delhi belly, the Roman groan- 
in’ or the like. Other thou- 
sands became ill and had to 
relieve themselves in the 
fashion of ancient emperors. 
Still they came. 

Nobody liked them. Nobody 
disliked them enough to wish 
a disastrous war. 

Actual trade was minimal. 
They bought large quantities 
of foodstuffs, paying in rare 
metals. But their economy on 
their own planet produced 
very little which the world 
itself wanted. The cities of 
mankind had long since de- 
veloped to a point of comfort 
and corruption where a rela- 
tively mono-cultural being, 
such as the citizens of Gusti- 
ble’s planet, could not make 
much impression. The word 



FROM GUSTIBLE’S PLANET 



27 




“Apician” came to have un- 
pleasant connotations of bad 
manners, greediness and 
prompt payment. 

Prompt payment was con- 
sidered rude in a credit so- 
ciety, but after all it was bet- 
ter than not being paid at all. 

T HE tragedy of the relation- 
ship of the two groups 
came from the unfortunate 
picnic of the lady Ch’ao, who 
prided herself on having an- 
cient Chinesian blood. She de- 
cided that it would be pos- 
sible to satiate Schmeckst and 
the other Apicians to a point 
at which they would be able 
to listen to reason. She ar- 
ranged a feast which, for 
quality and quantity, had not 
been seen since previous his- 
toric times, long before the 
many interruptions of war, 
collapse and rebuilding of cul- 
ture. She searched the muse- 
ums of the world for recipes. 

The dinner was set forth on 
the telescreen of the entire 
world. It was held in a 
pavilion built in the old Chi- 
nesian style. A soaring dream 
of dry bamboo and paper 
walls, the festival building 
had a thatched roof in the true 
ancient fashion. Paper lan- 
terns with real candles illu- 
minated the scene. The fifty 
selected A p i c i a n guests 
gleamed like ancient idols. 
Their feathers shone in the 
light and they clicked their 
paddle-like thumbs readily as 
they spoke, telepathically and 
fluently, in any Earth lan- 

28 



guage which they .happened 
to pick out of the heads of 
their hearers. 

The tragedy was fire. Fire 
struck the pavilion, wrecked 
the dinner. 

The lady Ch’ao was rescued 
by Calvin Dredd. The Api- 
cians fled. All of them es- 
caped, all but one. Schmeckst 
himself. 

Schmeckst suffocated. 

He let out a telepathic 
scream which was echoed in 
the living voices of all the hu- 
man beings, other Apicians 
and animals within reach, so 
that the television viewers of 
the world caught a sudden 
cacophony of birds shrilling, 
dogs barking, cats yowling, 
otters screeching and one lone 
panda letting out a singularly 
high grunt. Then Schmeckst 
perished. 

The pity of it. 

The Earth leaders stood 
about, wondering how to solve 
the tragedy. On the other side 
of the world, the Lords of the 
Instrumentality watched the 
scene. 

What they saw was amaz- 
ing and horrible. Calvin 
Dredd, cold, disciplined agent 
that he was, approached the 
ruins of the pavilion. His face 
was twisted in an expression 
which they had difficulty in 
understanding. It was only af- 
ter he licked his lips for the 
fourth time, and they saw a 
ribbon of drool running down 
his chin, that they realized he 
had gone mad with appetite. 
The lady Ch’ao followed close 

by Cordwainer Smith 




behind, drawn by some re- 
morseless force. 

She was out of her mind. 
Her eyes gleamed. She stalked 
like a cat. In her left hand she 
held a bowl and chopsticks. 

The viewers all over the 
world watching the screen 
could not understand the 
scene. Two alarmed and dazed 
Apicians followed the hu- 
mans, wondering what was go- 
ing to happen. 

Calvin Dredd made a sud- 
den reach. He pulled out the 
body of Schmeckst. 

The fire had finished 
Schmeckst. Not a feather re- 
mained on him. And then the 
flash fire, because of the pe- 
culiar dryness of the bamboo 
and the paper and the thou- 
sands upon thousands of can- 
dles, had baked him. 

The television operator 
had an inspiration. He turned 
on the smell-control. 

Throughout the planet 
Earth, where people had gath- 
ered to watch this unexpected 
and singularly interesting 
tragedy, there swept a smell 
which mankind had forgotten. 
It was an essence of roast 
duck. 

Beyond all imagining, it 
was the most delicious smell 
that any human being had 
ever smelled. Millions upon 
millions of human mouths wa- 
tered. Throughout the world 
people looked away from their 
sets to see if there were any 
Apicians in the neighborhood. 
Just as the Lords of the In- 
strumentality ordered the dis- 

FROM GUSTIBLE’S PLANET 



gusting scene cut off, Calvin 
Dredd and the lady Ch’ao be- 
gan eating the roast Apician, 
Schmeckst. 

TUTITHIN twenty-four 
^ hours most of the Api- 
cians on Earth had been 
served, some with cranberry 
sauce, others baked, some 
fried Southern style. The seri- 
ous leaders of Earth dreaded 
the consequences of such un- 
civilized conduct. Even as 
they wiped their lips and 
asked for one more duck sand- 
wich they felt that this be- 
havior was difficult beyond 
all imagination. 

The blocks that the Api- 
cians had been able to put on 
human action did not operate 
when they were applied to hu- 
man beings who, looking at an 
Apician, went deep into the 
recesses of their personality 
and were animated by a mad 
hunger which transcended all 
civilization. 

The Lords of the Instru- 
mentality managed to round 
up Schmeckst’s deputy and a 
few other Apicians and to 
send them back to their ship. 

The soldiers watching them 
licked their lips. The captain 
tried to see if he could con- 
trive an accident as he escort- 
ed his state visitors. Unfor- 
tunately, tripping Apicians 
did not break their necks, and 
the Apicians kept throwing 
violent mind-blocks at human 
beings in an attempt to save 
themselves. 

One of the Apicians was so 

29 




undiplomatic as to ask for a 
chicken salad sandwich and 
almost lost a wing, raw and 
alive, to a soldier whose ap- 
petite had been re-stimulated 
by reference to food. 

The Apicians went back, 
the few survivors. 

They liked Earth well 
enough and Earth food was 
delicious, but it was a horrible 
place when they considered 
the cannibalistic human be- 
ings who lived there — so can- 
nibalistic that they ate ducks! 

The Lords of the Instru- 
mentality were relieved to 
note that when the Apicians 
left -they closed the space lane 
behind them. 

No one quite knows how 
they closed it, or what de- 
fenses they had. Mankind, 
salivating and ashamed, did 
not push the pursuit hotly. In- 
stead, people tried to make up 
chicken, duck, goose, Cornish 
hen, pigeon, sea-gull and other 
sandwiches to duplicate the 
incomparable taste of a gen- 
uine inhabitant of Gustible’s 
planet. 

None were quite authentic 
and people, in their right 
minds, were not uncivilized 
enough to invade another 
world solely for getting the 
inhabitants as tidbits. 

The Lords of the Instru- 
mentality were happy to re- 
port to one another and to the 
rest of the world at their next 
meeting that the Apicians had 
managed to close Gustible’s 
planet altogether, had had no 
further interest in dealing 
with Earth and appeared to 
30 



possess just enough of a tech- 
nological edge on human be- 
ings to stay concealed from 
the eyes and the appetites of 
men. 

Save for that the Apicians 
were almost forgotten. A con- 
fidential secretary of the Of- 
fice of Interstellar Trade was 
astonished when the frozen 
intelligences of a methane 
planet ordered forty thousand 
cases of Munich beer. He sus- 
pected them of being jobbers, 
not consumers. But on the in- 
structions of his superiors he 
kept the matter confidential 
and allowed the beer to be 
shipped. 

It undoubtedly went to 
Gustible’s planet, but they did 
not offer any of their own 
citizens in exchange. 

The matter was closed. The 
napkins were folded. Trade 
and diplomacy were at an end.

Hartford turned up the vol- 
ume. **Three weeks in the 
woods, eating squeeze-tube 
beans; We’d be better off in 
the Fleet Marines . Sound off! 9 ’ 
“ONE, TWO,” boomed the 
voice of the Terrible Third, 



sounding from the hitchers at 
the chests of thirty-six safety- 
suits. Dust slapped up from 
marching-boots. A flock of 
scarlet blabrigars settled on 
the road ahead, chattering and 
watching like small boys. 
(t Sound hoff!” 

“THREE, FOUR!” The 
road led uphill toward Stink- 
erville; they were some three 
miles from First Regiment 
Barracks. Three miles from 
now these troopers could shed 
their safety-suits and helmets, 

33 




shower off three weeks of 
sweat, drink a beer and leer at 
the short-skirted, taut-hal- 
tered girls of the Service 
Companies. 

“Who are we?" Hartford 
chanted. 

“COMPANY C,” the troop- 
ers blatted back. 

The blabrigars, fluttering 
up from the roadway, chanted 
too: “Who are we? Company 
See. Who, we? See, see. Com- 
pany See Are Wee See See.” 
These wild birds didn’t mem- 
orize human speech as well as 
their captive cousins; they 
garbled their mockeries imme- 
diately. The flock settled into 
the sunflowers beside the 
road; and were joined by a 
pair of wild camelopards, 
chewing sunflower-leaf cud as 
they peered at the marching 
Axenites. Hartford looked 
about, but there were no 
Stinkers — Kansans — in sight. 
These natives didn’t care to 
watch the occupying regiment 
stir up their homeland’s dust. 
“ What platoon ?” Hartford 
called, his voice magnified by 
the bitcher till the whole col- 
umn could hear him. 

“THIRD PLATOON,” the 
men bellowed back, singing 
against the percussion of their 
boots. “ ’Toon, click, click, 
click; ’toon, click, third pla- 
toon, click,” mocked the blab- 
rigars in ragged chorus, re- 
flecting both the words and 
the marching feet.” 

“ Best platoon ?” 

“THIRD PLATOON!” the 
men shouted. They’d turned 
34 



up their bitchers to a volume 
the blabrigars couldn’t match. 
Disgusted, the birds flapped 
their scarlet wings and flew 
off across the sunflower 
fields. “ ’Toon,” one rear-flier 
chanted, “ ’toon, ’toon, ’toon.” 

“ Worst platoon?” Hartford 
asked 

“FIRST PLATOON!” That 
was for the benefit of Lieu- 
tenant Piacentelli, command- 
ing the tail-end of the Regi- 
ment, the platoon marching on 
either side of the lumbering 
Decontamination Vehicle, 
their safety-suit filters clog- 
ging with the dust. 

“ Sound off!” Hartford 
shouted. 

“ONE, TWO!” 

T HAT’LL rattle the win- 
dows in Stinkerville, Hart- 
ford thought. He pitched his 
descant louder and higher. 
“ Sound off!” 

“THREE, FOUR!” 

“ Run y er on down!” 

“ONE, TWO, THREE, 
FOUR; ONE, TWO, 
THREEP— FURP!” The men 
of The Terrible Third were 
grinning through the face- 
plates of their helmets, rejoic- 
ing in their reputation as the 
loudest bunch in the Regi- 
ment, happy to help Hartford 
in waging his mock-feud with 
Lieutenant Piacentelli. They’d 
been classmates at the Axenite 
Academy; they’d been room- 
mates in the Barracks until 
Pia’s recent marriage to a 
Service Company officer. 
Hartford lowered his bitch- 
by Allen Kjim Lang 




er to a confidential tone. 
“Square up, men; march tall; 
look rough and dirty. Show 
the Stinker girls what they’re 
missing. HUP, HUP, HUP. 
Sling those rifles square. Mon- 
drian, you march like you’re 
wearing skis: HUP, twop, 

threep, furp!” Up and down 
the column came the com- 
mands of sergeants and pla- 
toon-commanders, g e 1 1 i n g 
their troopers in parade-trim 
for the march through Kan- 
sannamura: “Stinkerville.” 

Somewhere up front a compa- 
ny was singing the anthem of 
the Axenite troopers, “Oh, 
Pioneers!” The chorus of 
twelve dozen men, their hitch- 
ers full-up, filled the Kansan 
air and echoed from the walls 
ahead. 

Stinkerville, all white- 
washed, with flakes of mica 
glittering in the sunlight, 
sprawled across the road that 
led to the Barracks. The vil- 
lage wall, designed to keep 
wild camelopards from roam- 
ing the streets and to keep the 
tame beasts out of the sun- 
flower-fields, was some eight 
feet tall. Some Indigenous 
Hominid had heard the Regi- 
ment’s clatter and song, for 
the gates of Kansannamura 
were open, the brick streets 
were clear of Stinker com- 
merce. The village seemed de- 
serted. A few blabrigars 
perched on the tiled eaves of 
the rammed-earth houses, 
making echoic comments on 
the sounds of the troopers, 
singing fleering snatches of 



“Oh, Pioneers !” A camelopard 
stretched its ridiculous, three- 
horned head at the end of its 
fathom of neck to peer, big- 
brown-eyed, at the caravan of 
fishbowl-headed men. Up at 
the head of the column the 
Regiment’s flags were un- 
furled and the Regimental 
Band was skirling the An- 
them; men were counting ca- 
dence as their boots clicked 
over the scrubbed bricks of 
Stinkerville’s streets. 

B UT no Kansan, Stinker, 
Indigenous Hominid, 
Gook or Native watched. No 
cowboy youngsters stared at 
the gunned-and-holstered men 
from another planet. No eld- 
ers looked down their noses 
at the brash invaders. No 
mothers wiped their hands on 
their aprons as they thought 
of their sons, and the fleshly 
price they’d pay for freedom. 
No teenage girls, those pa- 
trons of parades, watched with 
lips half-open with apprehen- 
sion and audacious thoughts 
about the hundreds of gift- 
wrapped young man marching 
past. This planet could have 
as well been named Coventry 
as Kansas, Hartford thought. 
Out the far gate of Kansanna- 
mura marched Third Platoon, 
Company “C,” then First Pla- 
toon, flanking the Decontam- 
ination Vehicle. A villager 
came from the house nearest 
the gate and closed it. He did 
not look after the two columns 
of men winding up through 
the fields of sunflowers to the

high plateau where they lived. 

The sight of the Barracks 
gave the men’s steps a new 
swing and spring. After three 
weeks of sleeping in safety- 
suits; of breathing, sweating, 
drinking, eating and excreting 
through germ-barrier valves 
and tubing, the prospect of 
stripping off the plastic bat- 
tle-dress was seductive. Inside 
that eight stories of window- 
less, doorless stone were gar- 
dens where the troopers could 
walk barefoot on the grass, 
pools whose water could 
splash their naked skin. In the 
Barracks were the three hun- 
dred Service Company wom- 
en who made the big stone box 
home to their three thousand 
men. 

The men of First Regiment 
massed on the parade-ground. 
While they stood At Ease, 
their plastic-sleeved rifles and 
packs growing heavier by the 
minute, their safety-suits 
staler, four of the five Service 
Companies marched out from 
the Syphon to join them. The 
women were suited in yellow 
plastic, giving rise to the gags 
about fool’s gold. The four 
golden companies took up po- 
sition at the center of the 
Regiment. 

Colonel Benjamin Nef, 
Commander-in-Chief, Kansas, 
CINCK, climbed to the re- 
viewing-stand in his command 
safety-suit of scarlet. Facing 
into the sun, the Colonel had 
the polarizing shield dropped 
over his eyes, and seemed to 
be wearing a black bandage. 



His lower jaw beetled to give 
him a truculent look generally 
ratified by his actions. His 
hair glinted through the hel- 
met like spun copper. Nef 
turned to his second-in-com- 
mand, a lieutenant-colonel in 
ordinary officer’s blues, and 
murmured instructions. The 
light colonel saluted, turned 
the controls of his bitcher to 
Full Loud, and addressed the 
troopers assembled : “Regi- 

ment. .” 

Down the chain-of-com- 
mand came the ripple of warn- 
ing: 

“Battaaalion. .” 

“Commmpaneee. ” 

“ ’Toooon. .” 

“Tain-HUT!’’ Fifteen hun- 
dred pairs of boots smacked 
together. The Adjutant held 
up his clipboard and read pre- 
cisely: “Attention to orders: 

“One. Officer of the Guard, 
Lieutenant Lee Hartford. 

“Two. CINCK commends 
troopers involved in the just- 
completed three-week Field 
Exercise on not having had a 
single incident of compromise 
of sterility. Household, Main- 
tenance and Security troopers 
are complimented on having 
maintained the integrity of 
the Barracks with a much-re- 
duced force. 

“Three. All male and female 
troopers are again cautioned 
that fraternization with Indi- 
genous Hominids is an of- 
fense punishable by General 
Court-Martial, and that any 
unauthorized intercourse with 
the natives is prohibited.”

T HERE was of course a 
murmur of automatic 
laughter at this last bit of of- 
ficial double-entendre. The 
idea of bedding-down a Stink- 
er wench was a favorite bit of 
pornographic fantasy. An air- 
tight safety-suit, though fit 
with valves as functional as 
the drop-seat in long-johns, 
was no garment for romance. 
To undress, to appear in out- 
door Kansas outside that head- 
to-foot sausage-casing, ap- 
pealed to none of the troop- 
ers. Healthy young men and 
women don’t entertain the 
thought of painful suicide. 

The reporting officer about- 
faced, saluted Colonel Nef, 
about-faced again. “Pres- 
ent. 

“Preezent. ’’ 

“Preeezent . .” 

“Preeeezent . ” 

“HAHMS!” Fifteen hun- 
dred Dardick-rifles, sheathed 
in plastic, slapped perpendicu- 
lar. The blue-clad officers, 
armed with pistols, touched 
their index fingers to their 
helmet-temples. The bands- 
men’s drums growled, the 
electronic horns sobbed 
against their miltes, and the 
flutes in lonely purity played 
the theme of “Oh, Pioneers!” 
For all his har-de-har-hard- 
ness, Hartford felt a sting in 
his eyes at this moment, as he 
did whenever the splendidly 
stage-managed ceremony of 
Retreat was performed. After 
the Anthem, much louder, the 
band played Retreat. The col- 
ors crept down the flagstaff, 



into the reverent arms of a 
pair of Service Policemen. 

“Oh-deph, HAHMS! By 
line-of-battalions, line-of-com- 
panies, line-of-platoons, line- 
of-squads, return to quarters 
and dismiss!’’ The light 
colonel made one last salute 
to CINCK, and the little ballet 
on the reviewing-stand was 
over. The troopers were now 
free to go in to their showers, 
their latrines, their suppers, 
and their women. 

“At ease,’’ Hartford told the 
Terrible Third. “Rest. Smoke 
if you’ve got ’em.” 

The men chuckled dutifully 
at the oldest joke in the serv- 
ice. An Axenite trooper, 
sealed in his germfree safety- 
suit and helmet, is by defini- 
tion a non-smoker outside his 
Barracks. It would be another 
hour they’d be outside, since 
the Third was next to the last 
of the fifty platoons to swim 
home through the Syphon. 
While the companies on the 
far left flank of the Regiment 
were ballooning-up and peel- 
ing-off in columns-of-squads 
to enter the Barracks, Hart- 
ford went back to talk with 
Piacentelli, C.O. of First Pla- 
toon. 

II 

ETTING inside the Bar- 
racks was a production. 
The safety-suits worn outside 
presumably bore on their out- 
er surfaces all the dust-borne 
bugs native to Kansas. To car- 
ry these bacteria into the Bar- 




THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS

racks, to be inspired and in- 
gested by Axenites — humans 
who’d never before had a bac- 
terium inside their bodies — 
would wipe out the Regiment. 
Axenites are chemically pure 
people. They have no immuni- 
ological experience. Their 
gamma-globulin is low, their 
intestinal walls are thin. They 
may be killed by a light salt- 
ing of staphyllococci, a soup- 
con of strep, or just a pinch 
of B. subtilis, a buglet as in- 
nocuous to “normal” humans 
as the dust-motes it inhabits. 

The Syphon was the only 
entrance to the Barracks. It 
opened as the “Wet Gut,” a 
ramp leading downward into 
liquid disinfectant which fi- 
nally filled a tunnel, which 
ran the length of the Bar- 
racks. Each trooper, as he 
walked down into the disin- 
fectant, grabbed the hand- 
holds at either side to pull 
himself along. Half-swimming 
through a turbulent portion 
that tugged at his suit with 
cavitations designed to loose 
the gummiest particle of bug- 
dirt, he came to a quieter sec- 
tion where he wormed along 
in silence, watching the man 
ahead of him, his stay in the 
antiseptic gauged to make the 
outside of his safety-suit as 
germfree as the inside. 

The Wet Gut ended in an 
upslope. The troopers walked 
out, dripping, into a hallway 
returning in the direction 
from which they’d just swum. 
This upper arm of the Syphon 
was a hallway so brilliantly 



lighted that the trooper had 
to drop his polarizing shields 
over his eyes. The air here in 
the Hot Gut was spiced with 
ozone from the ultra-violet 
sources. As each man strode 
down the Hot Gut at a set 
pace, his suit was bathed in 
u-v light from lamps in the 
ceiling, floor and walls. Just 
as he was washed sufficiently 
in the Wet Gut to kill the 
sturdiest-shelled spore of 
anthrax, the most insistently 
cysted protozooan, in the Hot 
Gut he was laved in actinic 
radiation powerful enough to 
afford a one hundred per cent 
safety factor against h i s 
bringing viable bug-dirt into 
the Barracks. At the very end 
of the Syphon, so that his 
safety-suit wouldn’t stink of 
disinfectant or crack from 
ozone-rot, the trooper was 
blasted from all sides by a 
needle-shower of sterile wa- 
ter. Then he was home. 

The platoon to the left of 
the Terrible Third had bal- 
looned and was column-of- 
squadding toward the en- 
trance to the Syphon. “At 
ease, men,” Hartford said. 
“Increase suit-pressure one 
pound. Open and check re- 
serve air-tanks. Close off fil- 
ters.” The men blimped a bit. 
Their suits sausaged out 
around their arms and legs. 
Should some trooper have a 
pinhole in his safety-suit, the 
positive pressure within 
would keep the deadly anti- 
septic solution from seeping 
in. “Okay, men. First squad

off to the sheep-dip. Check 
the man ahead of you for bub- 
bles. This is Save-Your-Bud- 
dy Week, ,, Hartford said. 

F AT-LEGGED and stiff, the 
men of Third Platoon wad- 
dled through the doorway and 
down the ramp into the bug- 
juice. One by one they went 
under, tugging themselves 
along through the turbulent 
area, past that; then turning 
over in three planes so that 
the man behind them could 
spot bubbles coming from any 
part of their safety-suit. A 
leak, of course, meant Decon- 
tamination. Decontamination 
meant an all-over shave, a load 
of antibiotics and quarantine. 
But it was better that one man 
should suffer this from time 
to time than that the Barracks 
should be sullied with a sin- 
gle bit of germ-laden dust. 

The pale-green murk of the 
Wet Gut and the desert 
brightness of the Hot Gut 
were the gates of home, and 
welcome. 

Hartford saw the Terrible 
Third off to their quarters, 
then got together with Pia- 
centelli to go up to Officers’ 
Country. It was good to un- 
clam helmets and breathe the 
inside air, smelling faintly 
green from having swept 
across the gardens on Level 
Eight. Hartford shucked off 
his blue suit and draped it 
over a refreshing unit. The 
device buzzed into action, 
washing, drying and recharg- 
ing the safety-suit with fresh 



filters and reserve air and wa- 
ter. The moment the refresher 
had grunted an okay to his 
safety-suit, Hartford carried 
it, clean and sweet as the day 
it had left the Goodyear plant 
on Titan, to hang it up in his 
locker, ready for his next 
foray onto bug-dirt. 

Piacentelli was already un- 
der a shower. “Come on, jay- 
bird,” he shouted. “Last one 
out buys the beers.” 

“No contest,” Hartford said, 
setting the shower-dial. “I'm 
gonna stay under water for 
three weeks.” He revolved 
blissfully beneath cold and 
angry needles. 

Piacentelli, snowed in with 
suds and steam, yelled 
through the blasting water. 
“How’d you rate O.G. the 
night we get in?” he asked. 
“I thought you were Nasty 
Nef’s fairhaired boy.” 

Hartford turned off his 
shower. “I got nothing better 
to do,” he said. He stood on 
the drier for a minute. “I 
don’t mind being Officer of 
the Guard, so long as I can 
eat supper off a plate instead 
of through a tube.” He 
stepped into his shorts, pulled 
on sneakers and tugged on a 
tee-shirt that had stenciled 
over its shoulders the two 
half-inch gold stripes of his 
rank. 

Pia dressed in a similar uni- 
form. “It isn’t the Messhall 
I miss,” he said. “It’s this. No 
number of ingenious engines, 
valves and relief-tubes can 
still my nostalgia for the sim-

pie dignity of our Barracks 
latrines/’ 

J UNIOR Officers’ Mess was 
set in what looked like a 
park, except that the bushes 
were tomato-plants and the 
trees grew apples. The tables 
were mostly full. "All the 
subalterns getting in a quick 
sundowner,” P i a remarked, 
finding a two-place table yet 
untaken. A Service Company 
K.P. in the brief skirt-and- 
halter Class B’s the women 
wore informally in the Bar- 
racks came to take their or- 
der. "Big cold beer for me, 
honey,” Pia said. "The other 
gentleman is tonight’s O.G., so 
he’ll have a black, black cof- 
fee.” 

Hartford stared after the 
girl. "You’re right, Pia,” he 
said. "No matter how comfy 
Goodyear makes those safety- 
suits, home is best.” 

"You bachelors are a threat 
to the Table of Organization,” 
Piacentelli said. "You’d breed 
us right out of house and 
home if you had a chance.” 
"Damned right,” Hartford 
said. 

"You could find a girl,” 
Piacentelli said. 

"They all itch to get mar- 
ried.” Hartford explained. 
“They come out to these 
germy planets like they used 
to go to Purdue. The man- 
woman ratio is in their favor. 
And biology. Pia, I’ve seen 
bears you wouldn’t glim twice 
on Titan turn into love-god- 
desses after six months here. 



I’ll meet some Service Com- 
pany corporal, say. She’ll look 
to me like the prettiest li’l 
thing since Adam’s costecto- 
my, and I’ll call in at the Or- 
derly Room to have us as- 
signed Family Quarters. Back 
at Home Base, she’ll turn out 
to be something you scare 
kids quiet with. She’ll talk all 
the time, leave lipstick on 
drinking-glasses, or play 
bridge and talk about it. First 
thing you know, I’ll be volun- 
teering for another five years 
duty on bug-dirt, just for a 
chance to leave her behind.” 
"So pick up a local germ,” 
Piacentelli suggested. "If they 
can’t decontaminate you, 
they’ll send you to Earth. 
Lots of women on Earth.” 

"I’d do it,” Hartford said, 
"but I’m still more scared of 
microbes than lustful for a 
woman. Here’s Dimples with 
our chow.” 

"Dimples?” Piacentelli 
asked as the girl came up with 
their tray. 

"Watch her when she walks 
away,” Hartford suggested. 

"You must keep a carton of 
goat-glands under your bunk, 
Lee,” Piacentelli said. "Mar- 
riage isn’t all bad. I've done 
pretty well with Paula.” 
Hartford nodded. Paula 
Piacentelli, a lieutenant in the 
Service Companies, was a 
pretty decent sort. "Where is 
she now?” he asked. 

"She’ll be on the Status 
Board tonight,” Piacentelli 
said. "You'll be in the Board 
Room with her. Lee, I've got 



40

a favor to ask you. As O.G„ 
you'll be in charge tonight.” 

"Paula will be in charge,” 
Hartford said, ‘Til be sleep- 
ing.” 

"If I go outside, though, it 
will need your okay as well 
as Paula’s,” Piacentelli said. 

"Who’s going outside with 
you?” 

"That’s the sticky bit,” Pia- 
centelli said. "I’d like to go 
outside alone.” 

“W ANT t0 run * n t ^ le ra * n 

i n your little bare 
skin?” Hartford asked. "Mix 
it up with a Stinker maiden? 
Paula wouldn’t like that. Be- 
sides, you might get yourself 
jack-rolled by some Indi- 
genous Hominid who doesn’t 
like Axenites running his 
planet.” 

"I want to work on my 
Kansan- Standard Dictionary,” 
Piacentelli said. 

"Bug-dirt,” Hartford said. 
"Don’t tell lies.” 

"All right, then,” Piacen- 
telli said. "I’ve got an idea 
that might lead to the most 
important discovery ever 
made on Kansas. Paula sug- 
gested it. I want to prove it.” 

"Tell Nasty Nef about your 
idea,” Hartford said, signal- 
ling the waitress for a second 
cup of stay-awake. "Give 
CINCK something clever to 
report when the supply ship 
lands, and you’ll have your 
silver stripes before I will. 
Wouldn’t Paula love that, 
though? Captain Piacentelli. 
I’d have to salute first.” 



"Nasty Nef wouldn’t consid- 
er our idea,” Piacentelli said. 
"He wouldn’t be happy to 
know that I’ve been studying 
the Kansan language, even. A 
common humanity between us 
Axenites and the Indigenous 
Hominids is a notion not wel- 
come to the world of Colonel 
Nef. Brother Nef, I might 
say.” 

Hartford leaned against the 
table to press a fist against 
Piacentelli’s propped elbow. 
"Don’t say that, Pia,” he whis- 
pered. “I’m not political; I’m 
not interested ; I don’t care 
whether the Brotherhood even 
exists.” 

"Yes, Virginia; there is 
a Brotherhood,” Piacentelli 
said. "And our Nasty Nef is a 
Brother.” 

"He’s a number of things,” 
Hartford said. "He’s our CO; 
he’s CINCK; he’s an SOB. 
But he’s our boss, and ‘Broth- 
erhood’ is a dangerous word.” 
He sipped his coffee. "Tell 
you what, Pia. If you want to 
go out and talk Gook with the 
Gooks, I’ll fix it for you to 
draw picket duty tonight. The 
man who’s got picket has been 
married only a month, and 
spent three weeks of that in 
a safety-suit out in the woods. 
I’m sure he’ll relinquish to 
you the pleasure of a night’s 
romp as picket officer.” 

"Can you do it?” 

"An O.G. can do anything, 
during those hours when his 
superior officers are asleep,” 
Hartford said. 

"You’re a buddy,” Piacen-

telli said. 4 T11 give you free 
tutoring in Kansan for the 
rest of our tour.” 

“Do mo arigato gazaimashi - 
ta” Hartford said. “Thanks 
to your mumbling the stuff in 
our room, I already talk like a 
Stinker.” He stood up. “I’m 
going down to the Board 
Room. Pick your companion 
for picket, and come on down 
when you’ve dressed.” Hart- 
ford bowed, Kansas-style. 
“ Shitsurei itashimasu ga ...” 
he said politely, and left to 
assume his duties as O.G. 

Ill 

A S one of the seventy-six 
male lieutenants of the 
Regiment, Hartford pulled 
O.G. about once every eleven 
weeks. His Terrible Third 
drew duty with him as Guard 
Platoon. All of them could ex- 
pect to sleep through the 
night undisturbed, unless 
Nasty Nef held a dry-run, fall- 
ing them out for a Simulated 
Problem. Nef was tired to- 
night, though; the Guard 
could sleep. Only the two men 
on picket and the handful of 
Service Company personnel 
on duty at the Status Board 
need stay awake tonight. 

Awake or sleeping, the se- 
curity of First Regiment 
would rest this night in the 
hands of Lee Hartford. It was 
he who bore the final re- 
sponsibility for allowing no 
living thing to enter the Bar- 
racks except in a well- 
scrubbed safety-suit; for as- 



suring that the air his sleep- 
ing comrades breathed was 
sterile and dustless; that the 
Syphon's poisonous bug-juice 
was of the proper pH and 
germicidity; and for checking 
that the whereabouts of every 
Axenite on Kansas was re- 
flected on the Status Board. 
That these duties were com- 
plex was attested by the as- 
signment of a Service Com- 
pany officer to the Board, a 
woman who would watch the 
Board’s bands of lights and 
meters every moment. Hart- 
ford could sleep; he was the 
Responsible Male. Mrs. Paula 
Piacentelli, 1/Lt. S.C. (Gnoto- 
biotics Spec.), had to remain 
awake : she was the Knowl- 
edgeable Woman. 

Hartford found Paula al- 
ready at her work in the 
Board Room. Only a bit over 
five feet tall, Piacentelli’s 
wife was concentrated woman 
of the most splendid sort. 
When Hartford had told her 
that Pia was taking the picket, 
she frowned. “I hope he 
doesn’t plan anything fool- 
ish.” 

“Me? Foolish?” Piacentelli 
demanded from the elevator. 
He walked up, clammed shut 
in his blue safety-suit, ready 
to hit bug-dirt. Under one arm 
he carried a package sheathed 
in opaque plastic. Behind him, 
in the gray safety-suit of an 
enlisted trooper, was a man 
Hartford recognized as Cor- 
poral Bond, machine-gunner 
from Pia’s platoon. “Lieuten- 
ant Gabriel Piacentelli report-

ing with one man. Sir and 
Ma’am,” he said, saluting his 
wife and Hartford. 

“At ease, Weenie-head,” 
Hartford said. “With you and 
Bond on picket amidst the 
sunflowers, I won't sleep a 
wink all night.” He turned to 
the corporal. “Did you sure- 
enough volunteer for this 
duty?” he asked. 

“Yes, sir!” Bond said. “I 
voluntarily assumed the duty 
of absorbing a fifth of Lt. 
Piacentelli’s Class-VI Scotch. 
The Lieutenant was kind 
enough to reciprocate by of- 
fering me this tour.” 

“He gave you Scotch?” 
Hartford turned to Piacen- 
telli. “Gabe, for a jug of 
Scotch I’d have gone on pick- 
et with you myself. What’s 
that you're taking outside 
with you? Lunch?” 

“A microscope,” Piacentelli 
said. “I’m doing a little re- 
search for Paula.” His wife 
nodded. A gnotobiotics tech- 
nician, responsible for main- 
taining the bacteriological se- 
curity of the Barracks, she 
had business with micro- 
scopes. 

“Want to give me the word 
on this romp of yours?” Hart- 
ford asked. 

“Standard picket, Lee,” Pia- 
centelli said. “I’ll learn a little 
Kansan, take care of Paula’s 
project and tell you all about 
it when we get back.” 

4<T ET’S see your weapons.” 
Hartford inspected 
Bond’s Dardick-rifle and Pia- 



centelli’s Dardick-pistol. Both 
weapons were loaded, clean 
and wrapped up for their trip 
through the Wet Gut in plas- 
tic sleeves. The trucks and 
heavy weapons stayed outside 
on bug-dirt. The lighter weap- 
ons and all ammunition came 
back inside the Barracks with 
the troopers who carried them. 
The weapons were detail- 
stripped on each re-entry, ir- 
radiated with u-v and fit with 
fresh sleeves. As had been dis- 
covered with the first axenic 
animals, in the 1930’s, keeping 
a mammal germ-free is a for- 
midable task. When that mam- 
mal is a human being and a 
soldier the job is double- 
tough. 

“Check out a jeep,” Hart- 
ford said. “Report each half- 
hour. Don’t shoot any Stink- 
ers... sorry, I mean Indi- 
genous Hominids. Try not to 
hit a camelopard with the 
jeep ; we’re low on replace- 
ment parts. In fact, be careful. 
Okay, Pia?” 

“Done and done. Exalted 
One.” 

Hartford dropped his voice. 
“I’d feel easier in my mind 
if I knew what’s so important 
as to require your desertion 
of our mutual womb tonight, 
Pia.” 

“Language study, you might 
say,” Piacentelli replied. 

“Ha! So desa ka?” Hartford 
replied. “That’s so much bug- 
dirt, and vou know it.” 

“Ha!” Piacentelli said. “See 
you at dawn. Take care of my 
wife, baddy.” 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS

“Aren't you going to kiss 
her good night?" Hartford 
asked. 

Pia grinned through his 
clammed-shut helmet and 
clomped to the elevator with 
Bond. They were en route to 
the Hot Gut and the Wet Gut, 
the twisting hallway from the 
sterile First Regiment Bar- 
racks to the living night of 
Kansas. 

Hartford turned. 

Paula Piacentelli wore the 
short skirt, knee-hose and 
short-sleeved blouse of Pio- 
neer green that was the Class 
B uniform for females inside 
the Barracks. She looked, 
Hartford thought, remarkably 
delectable; and he again con- 
gratulated his friend on .his 
luck in getting her. He re- 
turned his attention to the 
Status Board, which Paula 
was conning. Two red lights 
flickered on above the ground- 
floor diagram of the Bar- 
racks, indicating that the two 
men of the picket had entered 
the Hot Gut. A moment later 
these lights blinked off, and 
two lighted over the diagram 
of the Wet Gut. Piacentelli 
and Bond were swimming 
now, towing their weapons in 
ballooning plastic sleeves. 
Sterile, on their way out into 
a filthy world, these two men 
were the outpost that would 
protect through the night 
their hundreds of brothers 
and sisters sleeping safe in 
utero. Freud, thou shouldst 
have lived this hour! Hartford 
mused. 



P IACENTELLI turned the 
ignition key of the jeep 
he'd chosen. With the starting 
cough of the engine, one of 
the rank of TV screens over 
the Status Board lighted. The 
camera eye was looking out 
the rear-view mirror of the 
jeep, and picked up Pia’s hel- 
meted head and the shoulder 
of his companion. “We're off 
to see the Wizard, the Won- 
derful Wizard of Oz!" Pia- 
centelli sang. 

His wife spoke into the mi- 
crophone before her. “Don’t 
do anything foolish, Lieuten- 
ant," she said. “And remem- 
ber, all transmissions are re- 
corded and are audited, at ran- 
dom, by the Base Command- 
er." 

“Transmission received, re- 
ceiver contrite," Piacentelli 
reported back. “Okay, Paula- 
Darling. From now on till 
Bond and I swim home, we’ll 
be as military as GI soap." He 
flicked the TV monitor 
around to look out the wind- 
shield and started the jeep 
down the road toward Stink- 
erville. The duty of the picket 
was to chug around outside at 
random, hitting all the cross- 
roads, settlements and high 
spots of the countryside near 
the Barracks; to interview 
late-riding Indigenous Hom- 
inids and inquire their busi- 
ness being out; to conduct 
such searches of Stinker 
homes and hideaways as might 
s£em useful to the occupying 
Axenites; and to remain at all 
times in contact with the offi- 



by Allen Kim Lang 




cers on duty at the Status 
Board. 

As the picket got under- 
way, Hartford went down to 
the Terrible Third's area to 
check quickly through the 
two-man apartments. Knock 
on the door; "As you were, 
Troopers.” A brisk inspection 
of two safety-suits, gaping be- 
side their owners’ bunks like 
firemen’s boot-sheathed pants. 
The men were quiet. Guard- 
duty meant that any socializ- 
ing with Service Company 
troopers was impossible for a 
night, and militated against 
any intake of alcoholic bever- 
age. It was a bore, especially 
after three dry and womanless 
weeks in the field. Hartford 
visited his Platoon Sergeant 
last: “Sergeant Felix, could 
you have our bunch standing 
on bug-dirt ten minutes after 
I blew the whistle? Very well, 
then. Good night, Felix/’ 

Having demonstrated to his 
troopers that he was suffering 
the same strictures as they, 
Hartford went back to the 
O.G. cubicle in the Board 
Room. He checked his own 
safety-suit, his plastic-pack- 
aged Dardick-pistol, said good 
night to Paula Piacentelli and 
lay down to begin his first 
night’s sleep outside a safety- 
suit in three weeks. 

But sleep didn’t come easi- 

iy- 

There was the murmur from 
the Board Room; Piacentelli’s 
half-hourly reports. “Nothing 
to report, Paula. I’m at Road 
Junction (41-17). No I.H. ac- 



tivity. No excitement at all.” 
“Continue random patrol, 
Lieutenant.” 

“Yes, Dear. I’m going to run 
down to Kansannamura (42- 
19) for my next call-in.” 
“Carry on, Lieutenant.” 

Pia was in the best possible 
hands with Paula on duty, 
Hartford mused. The Status 
Board was really a woman's 
job. The girls of the Service 
Companies were the house- 
keepers of the Barracks, the 
guardians of the Regimental 
lares and penates. Paula, for 
example, had as her primary 
duty gnotobiotic control : the 
maintenance of the whole 
germ-free system of the Bar- 
rachks, from the Hot-&-Wet 
Guts to safety-suit inspection 
and the upkeep of the Decon- 
tamination Vehicles. Behind 
the women on Board-duty, 
however, was always at least 
one male, combat-trained Of- 
ficer of the Guard, ready 
(once awakened and briefed 
by the female help) to take 
armed men into the field. 

But meanwhile, Hartford 
wanted to sleep. 

H ALF an hour passed, and 
at its end Pia made his 
report : “Picket reporting. 
Paula. I'm going into the vil- 
lage. Corporal Bond will re- 
main with the jeep, and will 
keep the transmitter open till 
I get back. Okay?” 

“Be careful, Lieutenant,” 
Paula Piacentelli said, com- 
bining affection with military 
formality. 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS

Hartford, deciding that 
sleep was impossible, got up 
and cold-showered. Dressing 
in fresh Class B’s, he walked 
out to join Paula at the Status 
Board. The TV screen showed 
Bond, the sheathed Dardick- 
rifle slung over his shoulder, 
pacing back and forth in front 
of the jeep, glancing from 
time to time toward the walls 
of Kansannamura, white in the 
light of the skyful of stars. 
He was nervous, evidently 
aware of the fact that Kansas 
was largely unexplored, her 
potential for midnight may- 
hem untested. Bond spoke 
across his shoulder. “The lieu- 
tenant has been gone for a 
quarter hour, Ma’am,” he said. 
“Do you want me to go in and 
ask him to come out?” 

“Wait another quarter-hour, 
Corporal,” Paula said. She ex- 
plained to Hartford, “What 
he’s got to do may take a lit- 
tle time.” They watched the 
screen. Bond climbed back 
into the jeep, where he sat 
with his rifle between his 
knees, sweeping his attention 
around him, at the village, at 
the road behind, at the sun- 
flower-fields, where the blos- 
soms were bleached white and 
the leaves enameled black by 
starlight. 

With Paula’s agreement, 
Hartford pressed the micro- 
phone-switch to talk with 
Bond. “Have you tried to tap 
Piacentelli on his suit-receiv- 
er, Corporal?” 

“Yes, sir,” Bond said. “First 
thing. No answer.” 

46 



“Turn your bitcher full up, 
then,” Hartford said. “Tell 
Lieutenant Piacentelli that 
the O.G. wants him out on the 
road within five minutes.” 

“Done and done, sir.” Bond 
tongued the bitcher’s controls 
to Full Volume and repeated 
the message. Echoes bounced 
back from the walls of Stink- 
erville and lost themselves in 
the tangle of sunflowers. 

No one answered. 

The village seemed as much 
asleep as it had been before 
Bond’s bellow. The Kansans 
were never hasty to volunteer 
response to Axenites; they 
knew that troopers meant 
trouble. 

“Piacentelli is busy at some- 
thing,” Hartford said, as much 
to reassure himself as Pia’s 
wife. “I think I’ll go out and 
have a look.” He spoke to 
Bond: “Get out of the jeep, 
but stay close to it. Report 
any haps immediately. Watch 
for lights, listen for small- 
arms fire.” 

“Done and done, sir.” 

Hartford phoned Felix, his 
platoon sergeant. “Report to 
the Board Room to sub for 
me,” he said. “Wake the Pla- 
toon Guide and tell him to 
stand ready to fall the Guard 
out, but not to wake anyone 
else yet. This is probably a 
nothing, Felix; Lt. Piacentelli 
just went for a walk in Stink- 
erville.”

Status-Board indicators, 
flashed alive. 

“A nothing?’" Nasty Nef’s 
voice demanded. “What sort 
of talk is that, Lieutenant? If 
I’ve been properly interpret- 
ing the past five minutes’ 
transmissions, we’ve got an 
Axenite officer stranded in 
the middle of a Stinker vil- 
lage. This, Mister, is not a 
nothing. Call out the Guard. 
Prepare to join me in a Stink- 
erville shakedown. Those 
Gooks got to learn they can’t 
play fast-and-easy with Axen- 
ite troopers.” 

“Done and done, sir!” Hart- 
ford snapped. He toggled the 
phone to get Felix back. “Fe- 
lix, fall the boys out beside 
the Syphon. We’ve got the 
Old Man hitting bug-dirt with 
us, so look sharp.” 

“The colonel’s going out 
with us?” Felix asked. 

“Yes. There must be more to 
this situation than meets the 
company-grade eye,” Hartford 
said. “Diaper-up our darlings 
and stand by in the Hot Gut, 
Felix.” 

“Done and done !” 

Twenty seconds later a fig- 
ure in Santa Claus red came 
clashing into the room. Hart- 
ford, half into his blue safety- 
suit, came to a clumsy atten- 
tion. The newcomer, his hel- 
met clammed shut all ready 
for contamination, bellowed, 
“Get with it, Mister!” 

“Yes, sir.” Hartford fit him- 
self into the suit, a sort of 
cockpit, a congeries of valves, 
gauges, counters and vetters. 



In a moment he’d sealed him- 
self in the sterile suit, checked 
his air-filters and air reserve. 
“The Guard is assembled in 
the Hot Gut, sir, ready to take 
the field.” 

“Dam’ well better be,” Nef 
said. “Lead off, Mister.” He 
turned to Paula Piacentelli. 
“Send a Decontamination Ve- 
hicle after us, Lieutenant. No 
telling what those Stinker 
devils have cooked up with 
Piacentelli.” Back to Hart- 
ford: “You’re in command of 
the Guard, I’ll observe and of- 
fer suggestions.” 

“Tain-HUT!” Platoon Ser- 
geant Felix saluted the scar- 
let-clad colonel and the blue- 
clad lieutenant as they stepped 
from the elevator into the 
electric atmosphere of the Hot 
Gut. The Guard snapped to, 
their plastic-packaged Dar- 
dick-rifles at order arms. 

“Take ’em out, Felix/’ Hart- 
ford said. “Two personnel car- 
riers, a .50-caliber m.g.-mount- 
ed jeep fore and aft. You and 
the colonel take the rear jeep; 
I’ll lead. Have the men unbag 
their weapons the instant 
we’re outside. Any ques- 
tions?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Move out,” Hartford said. 
IV 

T HE squads peeled off and 
double-timed down the 
Hot Gut. Man by man they 
dipped into the Wet Gut for 
their swim outside. They’d 
been drilled for speed in exit-

ing. If the Regiment were 
needed outside, the Syphon 
could become a literal bottle- 
neck. As the last squad 
splashed into the antiseptic 
solution, Hartford turned to 
Colonel Nef. “Sir, I have a 
question/’ He said. 

“Hurry it up, Mister/' 

“Isn’t this a bit extreme, 
sir? We’re going out to take 
one man out of a primitive 
village where we’re not even 
sure he’s in trouble. And we’re 
carrying enough firepower to 
blast into an armed city.” 

“I don’t trust the Gooks,” 
the colonel said. “Their buco- 
lic way of life may be a fraud, 
designed to lull us into com- 
placency. Tonight we may dis- 
cover that they’re plotting the 
overthrow of the Garrison, 
using weapons and tactics 
they’ve kept secret. I hope 
such is the case, Lieutenant. 
It would give us adequate 
cause to wipe the Stinkers off 
Kansas and make this as clean 
a world as Titan.” 

“Sir. 

“Move, Mister,” Nef said. 
“Piacentelli has been in Stink- 
erville for fifty minutes. Let’s 
get him out.” 

The four trucks roared 
down the plateau toward the 
Indigenous Hominid hamlet at 
its foot. When the first Axen- 
ite Pioneers landed on the 
planet, bacteria-free as all men 
in space had to be, they’d set 
up camp near the spot where 
First Regiment Barracks now 
stood. They saw the fields of 
sunflowers, grown for food 



and cloth, and heard the na- 
tives call the nearest village 
Kansannamura. From that 
time on, this world was Kan- 
sas. 

There was no moonlight — 
Kansas has no moon — but the 
headlamps of the four vehicles 
were wasted against the bright 
ribbon of road, lighted as it 
was by the sheet of stars that 
melted together in a metallic 
ceiling over the night. The 
men sat with their rifles be- 
tween their knees, the plastic 
sleeves stripped off. Each of 
these Dardick-rifles could fire 
a solid stream of death. Each 
round of ammunition was fit- 
ted with a matrix that served 
as chamber, cartridge and the 
first fraction-of-an-inch of 
barrel. A magazine of forty 
such rounds could be hosed 
through the rifle in half a 
second. The troopers sped 
downhill, through sunflower 
fields black and silver in the 
light of the stars. 

T HE personnel carriers and 
the jeeps scuffed to a halt 
by the village gate, the men 
scattering like shrapnel, ac- 
cording to the book. Colonel 
Nef spoke to Hartford on the 
command-band. “Move in, 
Lieutenant. Bring out Piacen- 
telli. Any Stinker resistance is 
to be treated as open rebel- 
lion.” 

“Yes, sir.” Hartford spoke 
to his men: “First squad, lead 
scout, forward to the gate.” 
The scout, his plastic safe- 
ty-suit and the glass of his 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 



49 




helmet glinting highlights, 
scuttled to the gate. He kicked 
the gate open — Piacentelli had 
evidently left it ajar — and en- 
tered, rifle-first. “First squad, 
follow me in column. Open to 
Line-of-Skirmishers in the 
square. Second squad, follow 
in the same manner. Third 
squad^ maintain your interval 
and stand ready.” 

Hartford ran, pistol in hand, 
through the open gate. It was 
like charging some Roman 
ruin unpeopled for three cen- 
turies, like a field exercise 
with boulders marking obsta- 
cles to be won. There was no 
sign of natives. Their shop- 
boards hung bearing the pic- 
ture-script the Kansans used, 
quiet as the marbles in a ceme- 
tery. Hartford directed first 
squad in a sweep through the 
alleys, searching for Piacen- 
telli. Second squad clattered 
through the gate behind them, 
took up a skirmish line, and 
moved in to cover the square 
as first squad disappeared into 
the doorways and alleys of 
Stinkerville. 

The village, except for its 
beasts, might have been de- 
serted. These animals, came- 
lopards used for riding and to 
carry burdens, woke and gazed 
serenely down at the inter- 
rupters of their vegetable 
dreams, blinking their liquid 
half-shuttered eyes. Boots 
clattered on cobblestones. The 
houses were unlighted. 
“Throw on your i-r,” Hartford 
ordered. As they moved into 
the dark, narrow ways, the 



men beamed infra-red light 
from the projectors on their 
safety-suits, the bounced-back, 
invisible light being trans- 
duced to black-and-green chi- 
aroscuro by passage through 
the stereatronic goggles 
dropped inside their helmets. 

“Turn the Stinkers out, 
Mister,” Nef command-band- 
ed. 

“Into the houses,” Hartford 
signaled. Ahead, a boot 
slammed wood, and hinges 
burst. To the restless night 
sounds of the camelopards in 
their stalls, the click of mili- 
tary boots on brick, and the 
rustle of rifles against safety- 
suits was added the whisper- 
ing of families rousing from 
their beds. Hand in hand from 
father to mother to elder 
brother, dov/n the scale to the 
youngest, the Kansans stum- 
bled out into their little court- 
yards. “A no hito wa dare desu 
ka?” “Abunai yo/” “Shikata 
ga nai. ” 

U A NY sign of Piacentelli 
yet?” Nef demanded. 

“Not yet, sir,” Hartford 
signalled. 

“Feed a candle into every 
building, Lieutenant. We’ll 
get these Gooks in the open 
and interrogate till we find 
our man.” 

“Done and done, sir,” Hart- 
ford said, stepping out of the 
way of a little girl fleeing to- 
ward the village square with 
an even littler girl strapped to 
a pack-board on her back. He 
passed on the order. “Fire in

ten seconds, nine, eight. *. 
now!” Each man of first squad 
tossed a Lake Erie Lightning 
Universal Gas Candle through 
the window nearest him. A lit- 
tle over a second later a dozen 
grenades spit out a cloud of 
smoke with a hiss like a burst- 
ing fire-hose, and the outer air 
was filled with an eye-sting- 
ing gas. The Indigenous Hom- 
inids spilled out of their 
homes in all directions now; 
coughing, choking, children 
rubbing the smoke particles 
into their half-wakened eyes. 
Two camelopards, blinded 
like their masters, blundered 
into the square, tears stream- 
ing from their reproachful 
eyes, twelve feet above the 
pavement. Second squad's men 
danced clear of the beasts and 
hallooed them out the gate. 

Somewhere back in an alley 
a first-squad trooper tapped 
his trigger, jetting steel 
against overhanging roof-tiles. 
‘‘Nail that shot, Mister!” Nef 
demanded. 

Hartford heard the squad 
leader: “It’s Lieutenant Pia- 
centelli, sir. He’s here.” 

“Bring him out, man; bring 
him out!” Nef’s excited voice 
triggered a new string of rifle 
bursts. 

Hartford tongued his bitch- 
er full-volume: “Cease fire, 
you idiots! Piacentelli, head 
for the square.” 

“Stop it, for God’s sake, 
stop it!” Piacentelli shouted, 
his unamplified voice coming 
from a smoke-filled alley. 
Hartford plunged into the 



dark £moke — a tear-gas gre- 
nade had set afire some of the 
sun-flower-paper room divid- 
ers, and kindled with them a 
row of wooden houses — and 
shouted for Piacentelli. A bla- 
brigar, as blind in the smoke 
as the men, blundered against 
Hartford’s helmet. “ Yuke ! 
Yuke !” the bird screamed, 
grabbing hold of the transceiv- 
er-antenna that horned up 
from the helmet. Hartford 
grabbed the blabrigar and 
tossed it up above the melee. 
He heard it flying in circles, 
searching for its Stinker own- 
ers, chanting the last words 
they'd said to it: “Yuke\ 

Yuke! Yuke !" — “Go!” 

E verything was burn- 
ing. Even through the 
safety-suit Hartford suffered 
from the heat. He retracted 
his i-r goggles, useless in all 
this smoke. Nef called. “I'm 
coming in, Mister.” Hartford 
acknowledged. Great. One 
more blind man wandering in 
the smoke was what he need- 
ed. 

He tongued his bitcher loud 
and shouted; “Gabe! Come 
this way. Gabe ! Gabe !” The 
heat was intolerable. He posi- 
tive-pressured his suit, bal- 
looning the fabric away from 
his skin. How hot, he won- 
dred, would the rounds 
packed into the butt of his 
Dardick-pistol have to get be- 
fore they exploded? 

As though in answer, a snap 
of gunfire sounded from the 
fog ahead. Some meat-head 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 



51 




had spooked. There were more 
shots as other troopers fired 
at their fantasies. “Cease fire, 
damn it!” Nef shouted over 
the command-circuit. “If any- 
one was hurt by you idiots, 
I’ll court-martial every man 
with smoke in his gun barrel.” 
Hartford hurried on. Ahead 
of him in the alley he heard 
Colonel Nef’s voice, uncharac- 
teristically soft. “Hartford, 
join me. I’ve found Piacentel- 
li.” Ahead in the smoke was a 
pinkness: the scarlet-suited 

commander kneeling above a 
body on the bricks. 

Here in the open of plane- 
tary air, available to all the 
microscopic beasts of Kansas, 
Piacentelli was wearing only 
Class B’s; his sneakers, shorts 
and tee-shirt. The center of 
the shirt sopped blood from 
the bullet-hole that funneled 
into Axenite Lieutenant Pia- 
centelli’s chest. 

Nef stood. “The Decontam- 
ination Vehicle should be 
standing by,” he said. “Get 
Piacentelli outside. We may 
be able to save him.” He 
sounded unhopeful. 

Hartford draped his friend’s 
body across his shoulder. The 
smoke was bad, but he’d mem- 
orized his course through it. 
The air sucked in through his 
filter was clean, but hot. His 
helmet steamed opaque. As he 
stumbled out, blind, but guid- 
ed by the colonel’s voice, two 
men came forward to take Pia- 
centelli over to the Decontam- 
ination Vehicle parked by the 
village gate. In the cooler air 



Hartford’s helmet cleared. A 
girl gnotobiotician from the 
Decontamination Squad 
pressed the pickup of her hel- 
met’s “ears” against Piacen- 
telli’s bloody chest. 

She looked up. “He’s dead, 
sir,” she said. 

Nef’s voice boomed from 
his bitcher. “Burn the Stinker 
village !” he shouted. “These 
Gooks will pay for Piacentel- 
li’s death with their homes.” 

Hartford felt imminent dan- 
ger of vomiting, bad business 
in a safety-suit. He fought it 
as he looked around. The col- 
umn of smoke rising from the 
buildings already fired was 
sweeping around, carried by 
the morning wind that poured 
off the plateau. Everything 
within the walls of the 
rammed-earth houses would be 
incinerated. Kansannamura 
was destroyed. “Regroup by 
the vehicles,” Hartford spoke 
to his troopers. He walked 
back to his jeep, the village 
flaming behind him. 

The Decontamination Squad 
checked Hartford’s safety- 
suit, and found it sound de- 
spite its roasting. Piacentelli 
they cocooned in plastic: he 
was contaminated and danger- 
ous. As the five trucks rolled 
back toward the Barracks, 
they met families of Indigen- 
ous Hominids, smoke-stained, 
who retreated back into the 
sunflower-fields as the troop- 
ers drew near them. The 
Stinkers seemed to have sal- 
vaged little from the flames 
beyond an occasional blab-

rigar, perched on an old man’s 
shoulder, or now and then a 
camelopard, fitted with a sad- 
dle and carrying a blanket- 
wrapped bundle of clothing 
and cooking-pots. 

V 

H artford had to see 

Piacentelli’s body placed 
in the Barracks morgue, where 
a necropsy would be per- 
formed by a safety-suited 
gnotobiotician. It was seldom 
that an Axenite was contami- 
nated. Rarer yet was the 
death of a trooper who’d been 
exposed to bacteria. Informa- 
tion held in Pia’s body might 
someday save lives. 

Hartford, directing the 
sealing-off of the morgue 
from the rest of the Barracks, 
was not comforted by these 
reflections. He u n s u i t e d, 
shaved and showered, and put 
on fresh Class B’s to finish 
what remained of this O.G. 
tour. On his way back up to 
the Board Room he had to 
pass the morgue again. Colo- 
nel Nef, in the midst of a 
cluster of lesser ranks, was 
there. On a wheeled cart, cov- 
ered by a sheet, was a second 
body. 

Hartford stopped. “What 
happened, sir?” he demanded. 
“Who is it?” 

Nef raised the corner of the 
sheet with a hand that seemed 
infinitely weary. The body 
was Paula Piacentelli. “An- 
other accident,” the Colonel 
grunted. 



A hydroponics corporal, 
S.C., spoke up. “She was re- 
lieved of duty as soon as she 
heard about her husband’s 
death, sir. Someone should 
have stayed with her. She 
went up to Level Eight to be 
alone. There are only two of 
us on duty there through the 
night. She must have blun- 
dered off the walkway, blind- 
ed by her tears. However it 
happened, she caught hold of 
a lighting-cable where the in- 
sulation was frayed, and was 
electrocuted the moment she 
touched the wet seeding-bed. 
Colonel Nef found her there.” 

“I was going to console her 
on Gabriel Piacentelli’s 
death/’ Nef said. “Leave the 
body here and clear out, all 
of you.” No refrigeration was 
needed for Paula's corpse, of 
course. An uncontaminated 
Axenite was preserved by 
purity. The body might dry a 
bit, the integrity of the in- 
ternal organs suffer some- 
what from the corrosive ef- 
fects of their own juices; but 
Paula’s corpse would other- 
wise remain uncorrupted un- 
til taken outside and buried 
in bug-dirt. “Hartford,” Nef 
said, “I’d like to have a talk 
with you.” 

“I’m still on O.G., sir,” 
Hartford said. 

“And I relieve you of that 
duty,” Nef snapped. “Come up 
to my quarters.” 

Nasty Nef's sitting-room 
had the only window in the 
Barracks, a skylight through 
which poured the brilliatice of 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 



53 




Kansas’s pyrotechnic flood of 
stars. "Rest, Hartford. Sit 
down. Brandy?” 

Hartford allowed that he 
could use some. 

“What do you think of to- 
night’s adventure, Lee?” Nef 
asked. “Don’t look startled. I 
know the first name of every 
officer and non-com in the 
Regiment.” 

“What happened, sir, was 
horrible,” Hartford said. 

“I understand your feel- 
ings,” Nef said. “Two tragic 
accidents, killing your two 
closest friends the same 
night. I am certain that the 
loss of these comrades will 
fire your zeal for getting the 
Stinkers under control. Isn’t 
that right, Lee?” Nef took a 
cigar from the humidor next 
his chair. 

“With all respect, sir,” 
Hartford said, placing his 
empty brandy-glass on the ta- 
ble to his right, “I can hardly 
see how the events tonight 
were caused by the Indi- 
genous Hominids.” 

“You must use the official 
name for the Gooks, mustn’t 
you?” Nef mused. His voice 
turned harsh: “Someone 

stripped the safety-suit off 
Piacentelli, Mister.” 

H artford nodded, his 

face pale. The “A” of the 
Axenite’s alphabet was Ap- 
prehension. As a germ-free — 
axenic, gnotobiotic — h u m a n 
being, he is superior in most 
ways to ordinary men. He’s 
usually larger and stronger. 



He never has dental caries, 
pimples, appendicitis, the 
common cold or certain can- 
cers. No matter how much or 
how long he sweats, the 
Axenite doesn’t stink; nor do 
his other excretions. On a 
contaminated world, however, 
the Axenite is a tender flower 
indeed. A baby’s breath can 
be death to him, if that baby 
be a “normal” human; for no 
microbe is benign to the man 
without antibodies. To him a 
drop of rain may reek with 
pestilence, the scent of eve- 
ning may be a lethal gas. “I 
can’t understand their strip- 
ping Pia, sir,” he said. “Why 
would they do such a terrible 
thing?” 

“Because they’re Stinkers!” 
Nef said. “Can you imagine 
what it must be like to be one 
of them? Every inch of your 
skin a-crawl with living filth, 
your guts packed with foul- 
ness, your whole frame a com- 
promise with rottenness? Do 
you wonder that they’d de- 
light to make us as unwhole- 
some as they are themselves?” 
Colonel Nef lighted the cigar 
he’d been mulling. “Lee, do 
you think one Stinkerville de- 
stroyed is too high a price for 
them to pay for having mur- 
dered two Axenite troopers? 
For Piacentelli’s wife is as 
much their victim as her hus- 
band.” 

Hartford shook his head. 
“I’m not sure, sir. What both- 
ers me more than anything 
else is that it’s my fault Pia 
went out last night. He asked 



54 



by Allen Kim Lang 




me to arrange for him to re- 
place the scheduled picket of- 
ficer, and I did.” 

“Lee, why was Piacentelli 
so anxious to pull this extra 
duty?” Nef asked. 

Hartford tried unobtrusive- 
ly to squirm his chair out of 
the jet-stream from Nef’s 
cigar. “He told me he wanted 
to work on the language, sir,” 
he said. “Pia really had such 
a project. He’d never had con- 
tact with anyone with a speech 
other than Standard before, 
and the problem of transduc- 
ing one language into another 
fascinated him. The Kansans 
call their speech Nihon-go. 
Pia taught me to understand 
some of it.” 

“A waste of your time, Lee,” 
Nef said. “You’ll never have 
occasion to speak it. Be that 
as it may, unless Piacentelli 
was attempting to coax a 
course in Bedroom Kansan 
from a Stinker maiden, I can 
hardly understand why his 
lexigraphical labors should re- 
quire him to unsuit himself. 
No, Piacentelli was deliberate- 
ly murdered.” 

“I’m puzzled, sir,” Hartford 
admitted. “When we tossed 
those smoke-candles, I heard 
Pia shouting for us to stop it. 
Would he have done so if the 
Indigenous Hominids had him 
captive? Why did none of the 
natives lift a hand against us, 
though we were burning their 
homes? Why did Paula Pia- 
centelli seem to know why Pia 
was going outside tonight? 
Why did he take a microscope 



with him? Why did Paula kill 
herself?” 

££T~\ON’T noise that last 

U ‘why’ around the Bar- 
racks, Mister,” Nef growled. 
“Officially, she died in tear- 
blinded grief, an accident.” He 
smiled. “Whatever our reason 
for burning out Stinkerville, 
Lee, we got it done. The fact 
that those half-humans down 
the hill bred and sweat and 
poisoned the soil within half 
an hour’s walk has been a 
stench in my nostrils ever 
since we got here. Now they’re 
gone. I’m as sorry as you that 
the Piacentelli’s are dead. But 
the manner of their dying was 
such as to assure Axenic man- 
kind a new home.” 

“I’m not sure I understand 
you, sir.” 

Nef poured them each a sec- 
ond brandy. He raised his; 
Hartford of necessity fol- 
lowed suit. “To Brotherhood,” 
the colonel said. He stared 
into Hartford’s eyes. “To the 
Brotherhood,” he amended. 

Hartford was tired, con- 
fused and in awe of Nef’s 
rank ; otherwise he might have 
ventured protest. Nef sipped 
his drink. “I must emphasize, 
Lee, that what I say is my 
opinion only, not Axenite pol- 
icy. You see my point.” 

“I do, sir,” Hartford said. 

“Forgive me, then, for 
prefacing my remarks with a 
bit of truism,” Nef said. “In 
all history before gnotobiotic 
man was cut from his mother 
through cellophane, the hu-

man being was never pure or- 
ganism. Before us, every man 
who ever lived was, in fact, 
one mammal plus the sum of 
millions of viruses, rickettsia, 
bacteria, fungi and molds. 
When the old philosophers 
asked, ‘What is man?’ the an- 
swer could only be: ‘Foul 

smell and blood in a bag.’ 
We're the first men beyond 
that, Lee. The first real men, 
True Men, members of the 
winner-species. Homo gnoto- 
bioticus. 

“We must destroy the 
bridge that led to us. We 
must destroy the Stinkers. 
Not just these quasi-human 
natives here on Kansas, but 
the Stinkers on Earth, and on 
every other planet where bug- 
laden man has followed 
Axenite. What chance has 
Homo sapiens to match his 
sapiency against Homo gnoto- 
bioticus , when he is a bifur- 
cate septic tank, a polyculture 
of a thousand kinds of living 
dirt?” 

Hartford finished his 
brandy, wishing he were any- 
where else than in Nasty 
Nef’s quarters, tired, ill at 
ease and a little drunk from 
the two brandies. “What do 
you propose, sir?” he asked 
with Academy politeness. 

“Aha!” Nef rejoiced, pour- 
ing them each another drink. 
"You justify my trust, Lee. 
You perceive that I speak not 
merely if-ly, philosophically, 
but as a man of action, leashed 
only by temporary practicali- 
ty.” He leaned back in his 



chair and regarded Hartford 
more as a sculptor might re- 
gard a recent product than a 
father a son, with uncritical 
approval. “Where were you 
born, Lee?” 

“On Titan, sir.” 

iiT thought so. You have the 
-*-mark of natal excellence,” 
Nef said. “You’re a second or 
third-generation Axenite, 
then?” 

“Third, sir,” Hartford said. 
“Splendid. Your grandpar- 
ents were from their mothers’ 
wombs untimely ripp'd; your 
parents and yourself born nor- 
mally, in germ-free ambience. 
How fortunate we are, you 
and I ! T h i r d-generation 
Axenites. Eff-two of a new 
race.” Nef paused in his re- 
cital. “There is one fact that 
chafes us, though. We, per- 
force the Columbuses of to- 
morrow, explorers of the plan- 
ets beyond even the stars we 
see here on the frontier, are 
held back by our Stinker cous- 
ins. They have the proper 
feeling, that only pure man 
might pioneer the alien 
worlds, for fear of destroying 
what he finds there. But who 
will inherit those planets 
when we’ve finished our ex- 
plorations? Who will at the 
last till the fields of Kansas?” 
“Colonists from Earth, sir,” 
Hartford said. “From Eurus, 
Tinkle, Westside, Unashamed, 
T’ang, Williams’s World and 
Hope. From all the planets 
normal man has colonized.” 
“Doesn’t that annoy you, 



56 



by Allen Kim Lang 




Lee?” Nef asked. “That our 
work’s fruit is to be enjoyed 
by shiploads of Stinkers?” 

“They’re as human as we, 
sir,” Hartford said. He smiled. 
“You might say they just 
haven’t had our advantages.” 

“You’re tender-m i n d e d, 
Lee,” Nef said. “We garrison a 
hundred worlds on the Fron- 
tier, planets our Stinker mas- 
ters mustn’t visit yet, least 
Man contaminate some life- 
form yet unmet. We pioneer, 
clear planets as safe, and move 
on. For reward, we Axenites 
have three worlds of our own 
in the M’Bwene System, axe- 
nized for our use ; we have 
the Academies on Luna and 
Titan, and a dome on Pluto. 
It's not enough. We are the 
new men, the next-comers to 
humanity. We must have 
worlds of our own. I, and the 
Brotherhood whose hand here 
I am, intend that Kansas shall 
be ours.” 

“What about the Stinkers?” 
Hartford asked. “What will 
happen to them if we decide 
to axenize Kansas?” 

“Maybe they’ll leave,” Colo- 
nel Nef said, smiling in the 
manner that had won him the 
name “Nasty.” “A few more 
punitive expeditions like to- 
night’s — an incendiary gre- 
nade was thrown at Kansanna- 
mura, did you know that, Lee? 
I threw it — and we’ll have no 
Stinkers underfoot. We soon 
will be able to mop and polish 
this world to our own high 
standards. We’ll walk this 



lovely world without safety- 
suits and breathe unfiltered 
air. We’ll enter into our birth- 
right, Lee.” Nef gazed at his 
cigar admiringly, though it 
had gone out. “So much for 
the moment, Brother Hart- 
ford,” he said. “Perhaps we’d 
both do well to get some 
sleep.” 

Hartford jumped to atten- 
tion and formally requested 
permission to withdraw. Nef 
nodded. Hartford about-faced 
and left the room. 

VI 

T HE things the colonel had 
told him hadn’t fallen into 
place in his mind yet. Hart- 
ford was numb of thought. 

Back in his own room in 
B.O.Q. the numbness cleared 
a bit. He poured himself a 
drink. Somehow, he thought, 
he’d become fairhaired boy to 
an Attila the Hun, an Alaric 
the Goth, a Hitler, a Hainan; 
an Ashurbanipal I, a Rameses 
II. For Nef was equally with 
these a servant of Siva the 
Destroyer, with his plan to 
make Man pure. 

His purification would in- 
volve the destruction of all 
non-afcenic men and women 
all the way from the Home 
World to the newest beach- 
head on the Frontier ; the 
sterilization of a hundred 
worlds as culture media for 
the new race; and the plant- 
ing on the newly axenized soil 
of colonies of Homo gnotobi -

THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 




oticus , the feeder-on-hydropo- 
nic-greens, the inodorous, the 
thin-gutted, the strong 
toothed Superman. 

Nef’s pogrom had begun 
with the raid on the village, 
Hartford mused, his arms be- 
hind his head as he lay on his 
bunk. Nef had decided that 
this green and pleasant world 
belonged to the silver men, 
the true men, the new men. 
Us, Hartford thought. Earth's 
Stinker's, ordinary humanity 
with its common cold and its 
caries, would follow the Kan- 
san Indigenous Hominid, and 
the Great Auk, into history. 

The double funeral of the 
Lieutenants Piacentelli was to 
be held at Retreat, outside 
the Barracks. Hartford won- 
dered a bit at the haste with 
which the two bodies were to 
be consigned to the earth of 
Kansas. Perhaps haste was 
necessary because of the mi- 
cro-organisms with which 
poor Pia’s corpse was neces- 
sarily contaminated. 

Hartford grimaced. Contam- 
inated humans must lead 
disgusting lives. They smelled 
of ferments, were bloated with 
bacterially elaborated gases, 
suffered rot in their very 
teeth. Their corpses — poor 
forefathers! — suffered cor- 
ruption that would never 
touch an Axenite, whose un- 
embalmed cadaver would last 
longer than the best-mummi- 
fied Pharaoh. 

Whatever mysterious er- 
rand it had been that had tak- 
en Piacentelli outside the 

58 



Barracks, it had killed him. 
It was over. 

Hartford marched the Ter- 
rible Third into position fac- 
ing the graves, cut into the 
soil at the base of the hun- 
dred-foot flagpole. The entire 
regiment, less only the hand- 
ful of men and women neces- 
sary to secure the Barracks, 
was on the Parade Ground. 
Colonel Nef, his scarlet safe- 
ty-suit brilliant in the bght 
of the setting sun, stood be- 
side the graves, a finger of 
his right gauntlet inserted to 
mark his place in the black 
Book of Honors and Ceremo- 
nies. 

The regiment stood at pa- 
rade-rest as a truck brought 
the bodies of two comrades 
through its ranks. As the im- 
provised hearse halted and 
twelve blue-suited casket- 
bearers stepped forward to 
lift the flag-draped boxes, Nef 
called the regiment to atten- 
tion. The bearers slow- 
marched the caskets to the 
graves and placed them on 
the lowering-devices. 

VTEF’S words of funeral 

^ were few. He spoke of the 
dedication of the two Axen- 
ites being laid to rest and bit- 
terly accused the Stinkers— r 
this word seemed rude, in so 
formal a setting — of having 
murdered the young couple. 
He spoke of condign justice, 
and of revenge. 

This done, he called: “Es- 
cort, less firing-party. Pre- 
sent, HAHMS! Firing-party, 
by Allen Kim Lang 




FIRE THREE VOLLEYS !” 

The shots of the Dardick- 
rifles echoed down the pla- 
teau to the smoldering village 
below. The Regimental Bu- 
gler, standing between the 
heads of the graves, flicked 
on his instrument. As the last 
volley spat from the muzzles 
of the rifles, the bugler 
played Taps. 

Four men stepped forward 
to recover and fold the green- 
silk Pioneer colors, and the 
caskets were lowered to cor- 
ruption in alien earth. The 
banner crept down the flag- 
staff, and the funeral was 
over. 

Bone-weary, Hartford went 
from the Syphon to the re- 
f r e s h e r-room, where he 
checked his safety-suit and 
hung it. 

Another officer was there, 
still in his blue safety-suit. 
Hartford wondered sleepily 
why he’d so long postponed 
unsuiting. Even the fellow's 
helmet was sealed. ‘‘Our first 
deaths on Kansas,” Hartford 
remarked, wanting to coax the 
man into conversation and 
learn who he was. “I’d never 
realized till now that we’re 
really soldiers, subject to vio- 
lent death and formal bury- 
ing.” The man must be a re- 
placement, come in on the 
supply ship a month ago, 
Hartford thought. Black hair, 
crewcut. Tanned. Must be 
from one of the M’Bwene 
Worlds, where an Axenite’s 
naked skin can be unfiltered 
sunlight. “Both the Piacen- 



tellis were my friends,” Hart- 
ford said, determined to coax 
speech from the stranger. 

The man’s bitcher boomed, 
evidently set on full volume. 
“Mattaku shirazu ” he said. 
“Excuse. Pia not teach entire 
use of Standard tongue.” 

Hartford’s right hand tore 
through the plastic pellicle 
over his Dardick-pistol and 
brought the weapon to bear on 
the figure before him. “You’re 
a Stinker!” he said. “Pia’s 
s a f e t y-suit — that’s the suit 
you’re wearing.” 

“ Tonshu ” the Indigenous 
Hominid said, bowing his 
head. He indicated the empty 
holster at his side : he was un- 
armed. “I come on taku , here 
to your honored precincts, to 
speak of things done and of 
future things. You are Hart- 
ford?” 

Hartford thought quickly. 
His responsibility was to the 
Garrison. This stranger was 
above all else a possible source 
of contamination, a carrier of 
the micro-bugs that could kill 
every Axenite on Kansas. 
Shooting him would rupture 
the safety-suit he wore. As it 
was, his exterior surface was 
clean ; he could have entered 
the Barracks only by march- 
ing in from Retreat with the 
rest of the regiment, through 
the sterilizing Syphon. “I am 
Harford. Lee Hartford.” 

iCTylA said you are a good 

^ man,” the stranger said, 
bowing. 

“What is your name?” 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 



59 




“Renkei. As you say, I take 
Pia’s uwa-z ut sum i 9 this 
smooth garment.” Renkei indi- 
cated the safety-suit by slick- 
ing his hands over it. “I must 
enter here to talk with Hart- 
ford. To enter, I must have 
garment. Pia, my brother, is 
dead. I borrowed his garment. 
Can I, with you, stop the ugly 
thing that began last night in 
Kansannamura ? Kuwashiku 
wa zonzezu; I do not know. I 
can but try.” 

What a perfect disguise a 
safety-suit made, Hartford 
thought. Besides, it was the 
only passport a man needed to 
enter the Barracks. He stared 
at the stranger. He looked no 
different to men Hartford had 
met before, Axenites whose 
grandparents had been born by 
aseptic Caesarian section in 
Nagoya or Canton, two of the 
great gnotobiotic centers of 
fifty years ago. Renkei was a 
Stinker, a Kansan, an Indige- 
nous Hominid (ignominious 
name!) ; he was also, Hartford 
felt, a man. 

“Tell me why you made the 
dangerous journey here, into 
the midst of your enemies,” he 
said. 

“The death of our friend 
Pia. The burning of Kansan- 
namura. The war between my 
people and you who wear 
smooth garments,” he said. 
“This is aru-majiki koto* 9 

“A thing that ought not to 
be,” Hartford said, translating. 
He was glad for the practice 
he’d gotten with Pia, speaking 
the native tongue. “Sit down,” 



he said. “You must explain, 
Renkei.” 

The refresher-room, a hall 
filled with lockers and the 
machinery that automatically 
tested and refitted the safety- 
suits each time they returned 
to the Barracks, had a dozen 
entrances and exits. As Ren- 
kei, still completely sealed in 
Pia’s safety suit, sat on the 
bench beside Hartford, the 
doors all closed at once. They 
hissed as the pneumatic seals 
were set in their frames. 

Contamination Alert! Some- 
one, most likely the Service 
girl on watch at the Status 
Board, had discovered that 
there was one more person in 
the Barracks than could be 
accounted for. A crash-prior- 
ity head-count had been 
made. Each room and com- 
partment had doubtless been 
eavesdropped through the 
built-in TV eyes and micro- 
phone ears. 

One door at the far end of 
the hall burst open. A squad 
of safety-suited Service Po- 
lice spilled in. At the point of 
their wedge was the scarlet 
uniform of Colonel Nef. Dar- 
dick-pistol in hand, he ran to- 
ward Renkei. “Don’t shoot!” 
Hartford shouted, springing 
up. 

“Get back, Mister,” the colo- 
nel yelled. He dropped to one 
knee and squeezed all twelve 
rounds into the seated figure 
to Hartford’s right. Service 
Police swooped down to pull 
Hartford away from the shat- 
tered body of Renkei. The 



60 



by Allen Kim Lang 




lieutenant's tee-shirt was 
stained, however, by flecks of 
blood splashed up as the SPs' 
bullets chewed into the Kan- 
san. Hartford was contamin- 
ated. 

F OR the next hour, Hartford 
had no more to say about 
his disposition than an angry 
bullock being dipped and 
scrubbed against an epidemic 
of cattle ticks. 

His purification consisted 
in a sudsing with antiseptic 
soaps, this administered by a 
team of three Service Com- 
pany gnotobioticians who 
were completely indifferent to 
his modesty and who seemed 
determined to peel off the 
outer surface of his skin. The 
women, safety-suited against 
being themselves contamin- 
ated, shaved off all his hair 
and ostentatiously packaged- 
up the shavings to be burned. 
They administered parenteral 
and enteric doses of broad- 
spectrum antibiotics. By the 
time the gnoto girls were fin- 
ished, Hartford was as bald all 
over as a six-weeks foetus, as 
sore as though he’d been sand- 
blasted, slightly feverish as 
a result of the injections and 
madder than hell. 

Ignoring his demands to see 
Colonel Nef at once, the Serv- 
ice Company troopers helped 
him into his safety-suit. Hart- 
ford would have to live inside 
the suit for a week's quaran- 
tine, watched carefully to see 
whether a missed microbe 
would breed within him in 



spite of all the measures tak- 
en. 

Hartford's company com- 
mander refused him permis- 
sion to speak to the colonel. 
The lieutenant was to speak 
to no one concerning Renkei's 
invasion of the Barracks. He 
would remain safety-suited in- 
side the Barracks or out; but 
would otherwise continue 
with his regular duties. 

Hartford returned to the re- 
fresher-room where the mur- 
der had taken place. Renkei’s 
macerated body had been re- 
moved for burning. The room 
had been carefully decontam- 
inated, to the extent of hosing 
it down with detergent steam 
and individually re-refreshing 
each safety-suit in the huge 
hall’s rows of lockers. 

There was nothing to be 
done against Nef’s madness, 
Hartford thought. He sat on 
the bench where Renkei had 
sat. The ultimate breakdown 
in communication is silencing 
one side of the dialogue, he 
thought. That's why killing a 
man is the ultimate sin; it re- 
moves forever the hope of un- 
derstanding him. It ends for 
all time the conversation by 
which brothers may touch one 
another’s mind. 

What crap to find in a Sol- 
dier’s thoughts, Hartford told 
himself. He was an Axenite 
trooper, a Pioneer, a pistol- 
packing officer of infantry, 
commander of the Terrible 
Third Platoon. He was an 
Axenite, dedicated by the im- 
maculacy of his birth to the 

61 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 




conquest of Man’s frontiers, 

Hartford snapped his plas- 
tic-sheathed Dardick-p i s t o 1, 
death in a supermarket wrap- 
per, from his belt and placed 
it on the shelf of his locker. 
He’d seen the village of Kan- 
sannamura burned. Pia had 
died across his shoulder. Paula 
lay buried, too. Renkei’s life 
had been splashed out on a 
stream of bullets. Enough of 
death. 

Hartford picked up a pack 
of field-ration squeeze-tubes 
and walked down the hallway 
toward the Syphon. 

His leaving would show on 
the Status Board, of course, 
but that didn’t matter any 
more. He was deserting the 
regiment. 

H E walked through the val- 
ley of desert that was the 
Hot Gut, and down into the 
birth-canal that was the Wet 
Gut, to emerge in the evening 
air of Kansas. The motor ser- 
geant, stationed outside to 
guard the vehicles, saluted. 
“Going for a walk, sir?” he 
asked. 

“If you’ll lend me a jeep, I’ll 
go for a ride,” Hartford said. 
“I’d like to see how things 
look, down in the village.” 
“It’s against regulations, 
but if you’ll have the truck 
back by dark I can let it go, 
sir.” 

“Thank you, Sergeant.” 
Hartford returned the salute 
and drove off downhill, to- 
ward Kansannamura. 

What would happen to 



H a r t f o r d-the-deserter? he 
wondered. At best, he’d be 
booted out of the troopers and 
grounded on Titan, or Luna 
or one of the M’Bwene plan- 
ets, to serve the rest of his 
life as a paper-pusher, the 
bureaucratic equivalent of an 
endless Kitchen Police. At 
worst, he’d be exiled to Earth. 

That meant exposure to bac- 
teria, a gradual contamination 
till he’d been exposed to the 
full dirtiness in which earth- 
lings daily lived, till he’d 
equipped himself with anti- 
bodies and a Stinker’s im- 
mune-response. 

The Service Police weuld 
be after him soon. Once out 
6f sight of the Barracks, he 
turned his jeep off the road, 
onto one of the numberless 
paths used by camelopard 
riders on their trips between 
Stinker villages. He was head- 
ed upgrade, now, toward the 
mountains. On either side of 
the jeep were the fields of 
sunflowers, silent in the twi- 
light calm. In a few moments 
the cool winds from the sea 
would flow into the land, stir- 
ring the billions of heart- 
shaped sunflower-leaves into 
the whisper that filled the 
evening and early-morning 
hours of Kansas. 

His heart filled with hope 
and hopelessness, feeling like 
a happy suicide, Hartford 
sang to himself as the sun- 
flower heads and leaves tat- 
tooed against his windshield. 
Pioneers! O Pioneers he sang, 
the anthem of the Axenites, 



62 



by Allen Kim Lang 




the fellowship he was leaving 
forever: 

Lo, the darting bowling orb! 

Lo, the brother orbs around, 
all the clustering suns and 
planets, 

All the dazzling days, all 
the mystic nights with 
dreams, Pioneers! O pio- 
neers ! 

The crunching of the jeep 
over the narrow track, the 
whipping of the plants 
against the vehicle and his 
singing all combined to drown 
out whatever noise it was the 
girl might have made. Hart- 
ford didn’t see her till the 
jeep, rearing like a startled 
pony, climbing the flank of 
the camelopard the girl rode, 
tossed him into a tangle of 
green stalks and golden flow- 
ers. 

VII 

T HE riding camelopard 
bleated only a moment and 
was dead, its great neck brok- 
en by the jeep’s charge. The 
girl, thrown clear, was up be- 
fore Hartford. 

A scarlet bird circled the 
scene of the wreck, the dead 
beast, the stalled jeep, the man 
and the woman sprawled by 
the side of the path. “ Miyo ! 
Miyol Miyo!” cried the bla- 
brigar: “See! See! See!” 
Hartford rose and went to 
the girl, who was rubbing the 
shoulder she’d landed on. She 
stared, but didn’t back away. 



“Kinodoku semban/* he said 
very carefully: a thousand - 
myriad pardons . His bitcher, 
unfortunately, was set on full 
volume; his words of comfort 
blatted at the girl with parade- 
ground force. She put her 
hands over her ears. 

The blabrigar above them, 
impressed by Hartford’s sten- 
torian voice, circled repeating 
“ Kinodoku semban ” over and 
over, till the girl called it 
down to rest quietly on her 
shoulder. The girl spoke to the 
bird, which stared at her lips 
with his head cocked to one 
side, an attentive student. She 
repeated four times the same 
message. The bird nodded, and 
repeated the phrase to her. 
“Yuke!” the girl said. The 
blabrigar spread its scarlet 
wings and flew up. It circled 
twice, then headed north, up 
into the mountains. Of the 
girl’s message Hartford had 
understood only the native 
word for camelopard : giraffu . 
His Kansan was inadequate. 
He could understand it only 
if it were slowly spoken. 

Hartford tongued his hitch- 
er’s controls to a conversation- 
al level. “Kinodoku semban ” 
he repeated, bowing. 

The girl knelt beside the 
dead camelopard and stroked 
its head, over the central, ves- 
tigal horn. She looked up at 
Hartford with tears in her 
eyes. “Tonshu” Hartford 
said : I bow my head. 

“Anata we dare desu ka?” 
she asked. 

“Lee Hartford,” he replied. 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS

The girl spoke slowly. “I 
am named Take.” She knit her 
hands before her and bowed. 
“Forgive my bad actions/’ she 
said. 

“The fault is entirely mine, 
Takeko,” Hartford replied. He 
was sorry, of course, to have 
killed the girl’s steed and to 
have subjected her to danger; 
he was very glad to have met 
her. Takeko wore what must 
have been the Kansan riding 
costume : short trousers and a 
jacket woven of floss from 
retted sunflower stalk, dyed a 
golden brown. Most curious, 
he thought, was her perfume; 
mild, flowerlike, slightly pun- 
gent. The smell of this lovely 
Stinker belied the trooper 
epithet. 

Then it hit him. 

The filters of a safety-suit 
remove, together with all the 
dust of the ambient air, all its 
character, including odor. The 
clean, characteristic smells of 
the Barracks, together with 
the bland spit-and-sweat odors 
of a long-worn safety-suit, 
were all an Axenite came in 
contact with. 

If he were able to smell the 
outside world, it could only 
be because his gnotobiotic se- 
curity was compromised. 

Hartford inspected his safe- 
ty-suit, peering where he 
could and twisting and feeling 
the surfaces he couldn't see. 
Takeko laughed. She reached 
across his shoulder and lifted 
a flap of torn fabric, ripped 
loose when Hartford had 
flown from his jeep. 



H IS panic would have been 
unmanly in a normal 
human; but Hartford all his 
life had been impressed with 
the horror of contamination. 
He ran blindly, though he 
knew that his deepened 
breathing was drawing the 
germ-laden air of Kansas 
deeper into his lungs. He ran 
through lanes of sunflowers, 
flailing his arms, into the 
darkness, away from the alien 
girl, away from the fear of go- 
ing septic. He ran and stum- 
bled and fell and ran again. 
All his life he’d been warned 
of the consequences of becom- 
ing infected with the bacteria 
against which he had no de- 
fenses. Now he was so infect- 
ed. 

When Hartford fell the last 
time it was for sheer lack of 
wind. 

He opened his helmet and 
tossed it aside. Dead already, 
he could lose nothing by mak- 
ing himself comfortable for 
dying. He shivered. The chill 
of infection? No, the night 
was cool. He looked about him 
in the light of the sky of stars. 
The fields were below him, 
rustling in a million private 
conversations as the breeze fil- 
tered through them. It was a 
lovely place to die, here on 
the crest of a hill. 

Hartford lay back and 
stared into the curtain of 
stars that rippled above him. 
Perhaps he wouldn’t wake, he 
thought. With this thought he 
slept. 

The sunlight stung his eyes.

He sprang to his feet, then 
bent and groaned. Sore. He'd 
slept on naked soil, packed 
hard by the hillcrest winds. 
He stretched his hard-bedded 
muscles. For a dead man, he 
felt good. The alien bacteria 
and viruses within him were 
establishing beachheads, mul- 
tiplying their platoons to com- 
panies, their companies to bat- 
talions. By the time they’d 
reached division-strength, he 
thought, he’d be well aware of 
the invasion. 

Meanwhile, breakfast. 

He opened a package of 
field-r ations, squeeze-tube 
beans. He inserted the nozzle 
of the tube into his mouth and 
fed himself a dollop of the 
stuff. It felt strange to eat di- 
rectly from the tube, not hav- 
ing inserted the adjutage into 
his helmet-opening to be ster- 
ilized first. Being septic saved 
a lot of time. 

He finished the squeeze- 
tube beans and was thirsty. 
Down at the base of his hill 
was a little stream. Hartford 
thoughtfully peeled off his 
safety-suit. Dressed only in 
his shorts, shirtless, barefoot 
and tender, he made his way 
down to the water. 

It was delicious. 

Did bacteria impart that 
brisk taste? Hartford won- 
dered. So far committed to 
contamination that nothing 
mattered, he shed his shorts 
and dived into the stream. It 
was chilly, delightful. He re- 
turned to shore and lay on the 
grass for the sun to toast him 



dry. He began to relax. The 
girl giggled. 

H artford snatched up 
his shorts and pulled 
them on. It was Takeko. She 
was afoot, wearing the cos- 
tume he'd last seen her with; 
but she had strapped on her 
back a leather wallet. A bla- 
brigar sat on Takeko’s shoul- 
der. She spoke to it, repeating 
her message four times and 
listening to the bird repeat 
once. Then she shooed the 
scarlet bird away, to carry 
north the message that Hart- 
ford had been found. 

“I laugh. Excuse me,” she 
said. “But you funny.” Take- 
ko patted her head. Hartford 
understood. Shaved by the De- 
contamination Squad, he was 
bald and eyebrowless, entirely 
lacking in body hair. He 
. smiled. “Hai.” 

“Your skin is like the hide 
of a giraffu,” she said. 

Hartford looked down at his 
freckled arm. True, the pat- 
tern of brown against pink 
was very like the reticulations 
of a camelopard. “Where did 
you learn to speak Standard, 
Takeko ?” 

“Pia-san talked to my cous- 
in, and I listened,” she said. 
“Kansannamura was my home. 
Pia often visited us.” Hart- 
ford, who after Nasty Nef was 
the man most responsible for 
the burning of Takeko’s vil- 
lage, was silent. “When your 
jeepu-kuruma hit my giraffu , 
I think you are Renkei,” the 
Kansan girl said. “Renkei is 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 



65 




my cousin. He go to see what 
can be done.” 

“Renkei is dead,” Hartford 
told her. 

“lie !” Takeko pressed her 
hands against her face. “You 
strangers are quick to kill, to 
burn, to sweep away.” 

“I did not wish him 
harmed,” Hartford said. 

“You pink folk will not be 
happy until all our people are 
dead and under the ground,” 
Takeko moaned. “You will not 
be pleased until you can 
march across our graves.” 
“That is not so.” 

“Pia-san said it,” Takeko 
said. “He said that your Nef 
is a master of the Brother- 
hood, which wishes death to 
all people who do not wear 
glass heads.” 

“If that is true, I am no 
longer a part of it, Takeko- 
san,” Hartford said. “I have 
left Nef and his Barracks. I 
am a dead man.” 

“You will come with me,” 
Takeko said. “You will not be 
dead for many years, unless 
Nef and his Brotherhood kill 
you.” She looked into the sky, 
where a red bird was circling. 
It hawked down to her shoul- 
der and sat there, its head tilt- 
ed to her. “Takeko,” the girl 
said to the bird. With this key 
to unlock its message the bla- 
brigar spilled its rote. Hart- 
ford recognized a word or two 
of the bird-o-gram, but not the 
full sense of the message. 

Takeko reached into the 
pocket of her short trousers 
for a few zebra-striped sun- 



flower-seeds. The blabrigar 
picked these daintily from her 
hand, using its beak like a pair 
of precise tweezers, pinching 
up one seed at a time and 
cracking it. “There will soon 
come giraffu to take us to a 
further village,” Takeko said. 
“You are to speak to our chief 
men there, to tell them what 
happened to Renkei, why he 
was killed in the Stone 
House.” 

“I may not live through this 
day,” Hartford said. “It is not 
easy to explain. We wear the 
‘glass head’ to keep out your 
air. It is deadly, doku , to us. 
Do you understand, Takeko?” 

{{'VT'OU may be tired, having 
1 slept on the old bones of 
the hill,” she said. “You may 
be hungry, having eaten only 
the squeezings of your metal 
sausages. But you are not hurt 
badly, nor are you old, Lee- 
san. Why should you die?” 

“You cannot understand,” 
Hartford said. He spoke more 
to himself than to the girl. 
“The medicine here is certain- 
ly primitive. You have no con- 
cept of the biological nature 
of disease. Tell me, Takeko- 
san, do you Kansans know 
anything of the very, very 
small. ” 

“Microscopic?” Takeko 
asked. 

“Piacentelli did a splendid 
job of teaching you the Stand- 
ard language,” Hartford said. 
He looked up and down Take- 
ko's trim, just post-adolescent 
figure in frank appraisal, jeal-

before you glass-headed men 
came/' Takeko said. “Now we 
are treated in our own villages 
like rats to be driven out, in 
our fields as gnawing vermin. 
Why is your Brotherhood so 
angry with us, Lee-san, who 
live in only a few places on a 
wide world? Is there no law 
among the light-skinned peo- 
ple? We have lived here, on 
the world you call Kansas, for 
many generations. We were 
once of Earth, as were your 
grandfathers.” 

“All humans were once of 
Earth,” Hartford said. 

“If we are as much human 
as you,” she said, “why does 
your Nef call us Hominids? Is 
that a name to give a broth- 
er?” 

“It is better than Stinker ” 
Hartford suggested. 

“Hai! I tell you, Lee-san 
why you must re-name us. It 
is because men do not kill men 
until they give their brother- 
enemy a monstrous name. 
Why do you wish to kill us 
all?” she asked. 

“I’m not a member of the 
Brotherhood,” Hartford said. 
“I'm only a man who was born 
on Axenite. That means, until 
your beast and my jeep collid- 
ed, tearing my safety-suit, I 
was an animal uncontaminated 
by microscopic life. These 
microscopic animals, Takeko, 
are deadly to an Axenite.” 
“You are not dead, though,” 
Takeko suggested. “ Ne ?” 

“I've been breathing con- 
taminated air for twelve 
hours,” Hartford said. “It's 

68 



true. I cannot understand why 
I have no fever, no malaise, 
no symptoms of pneumonia.” 
Takeko giggled. “Forgive 
me,” she said. “Kinodoku sem - 
ban ; but you seem to be sorry 
to be alive.” She was silent for 
a moment, listening. She 
pointed north. “My father will 
appear with our giraffu soon,” 
she said. “I can hear them.” 
Takeko's father rode up a 
moment later, an unbent man 
of seventy. He sat astride his 
camelopard, a comic quad- 
ruped little better designed as 
a beast of burden than an os- 
trich, with as much dignity as 
though his steed were an Ara- 
bian stallion. His name, Take- 
ko said, was Kiwa-san. The 
old man bowed from his sad- 
dle when his daughter intro- 
duced Hartford. 

A T Kiwa-san’s command the 
two giraffu he'd brought 
along on lead-reins spread 
their legs to bring their down- 
sloping backs a scant four feet 
from the ground. The saddles, 
with dangling, boot-like gam- 
badoes in place of ordinary 
stirrups, seemed inaccessible 
to Hartford. “Watch me,” Ta- 
keko told him. She took a 
short run up behind her giraf- 
fu and, with a movement like 
a leap-frog hurdle, flipped 
herself up into the saddle. 

Hartford stepped back, ran 
and leaped. He succeeded only 
in banging his shoes into the 
right sifle-joint of his mount 
and in flipping himself to the 
ground. In the interest of

haste, grace was abandoned. 
Hartford monkey-crawled up 
a sturdy cane of bamboo grow- 
ing nearby and, as Kiwa-san 
maneuvered his beast, stepped 
over into the saddle. 

“I'd better take my safety- 
suit and helmet/' he said. “If 
the troopers should find it, 
they could follow our trail." 

“Hai!” Takeko said, agree- 
ing. She leaped from her 
giraffu, packed the safety-suit 
and helmet onto the beast, and 
remounted. “We will now go 
to Yamamura," she said. Old 
Kiwa spoke, and she translat- 
ed: “We must move quickly 
and with care," she said. “My 
father heard an hikoki — how 
do you say?" she asked, rais- 
ing and lowering her hand. 

“A veeto-platform," Hart- 
ford said. “I mustn't be seen, 
Takeko. Colonel Nef would 
use my presence as an excuse 
to kill any of your people 
around me." 

The ride, though cautious, 
was indeed demanding. Hart- 
ford felt tendons stretch he 
didn't know he had. Muscles 
were bruised from his instep 
to his upper back, and the skin 
was chafed away from his in- 
ner thighs as though he'd been 
riding an unplaned plank. He 
understood, well before the 
journey to the mountain vil- 
lage was over, the importance 
of that lifetime exercise, best 
begun by riding young, known 
to generations of horsemen as 
“stretching the crutch." He 
swore to himself that his fu- 
ture transportation, if he had 



a future through which to 
transport himself, would be by 
boots or wheeled vehicle. 

The three of them were fol- 
lowing no clear path. Kiwa 
led. Hartford noted that their 
course took them along the 
contours of streams, on the 
borders of fields, through con- 
trasting background that 
would make their presence 
less obvious from the air. 

They were in a thicket of 
bamboo when the veeto-plat- 
form did appear. 

The instant they heard its 
whistle, Kiwa spoke a sharp 
word. He and his daughter 
slipped from their mounts, 
loosed the brow-bands of their 
camelopards and unlocked 
their girths, tossed off the 
saddles and dangling gamba- 
does and gave the animals 
each a sharp slap on the rump 
that sent them crashing 
through the bamboo. They 
helped Hartford unsaddle and 
send his beast off in another 
direction, and lay down in the 
direction the late-morning sun 
dialed the shadows of the 
bamboo stems. 

If the veeto-pilot saw the 
giraffu now, they were sad- 
dleless and innocent. 

The downdraft of the veeto- 
platform puffed dust up from 
the ground around them, and 
pressed down the leafy tops 
of the bamboo like a great 
hand stroking across the 
thicket. Hartford, aware of 
the way his bald head and pink 
face would stand out, dusted 
his hands with the soil and 



70

laced his dusty fingers over 
his scalp. 

The platform passed almost 
directly over them, shooting 
fragments of dust and bam- 
boo-duff into every particle of 
clothing, into ears and eyes 
and nostrils, with the whirl- 
wind of its passage. 

VIII 

I T took them half an hour to 
recover their giraifu and 
saddle up again, but Hartford 
did not regret the delay. 

Aboard the grotesque mount 
again, he groaned. To mask 
the misery of his unaccus- 
tomed pounding he paid sci- 
entific attention to the land- 
scape, the gait of the camelo- 
pards, the leather of the sad- 
dles, and the posture and per- 
son of Takeko — this last by 
far the most effective of his 
analgesic thoughts. 

They rode on an ancient 
piedmont, among the foothills 
of a worn-down mountain- 
range. The leather of their 
saddles and gambadoes was, 
by its pattern, obviously 
tanned camelopard-hide. Hart- 
ford was certain that this pat- 
tern would by the end of their 
journey be an indelible part 
of his own hide. The giraifu, 
remarkably swift and easy- 
moving over the rugged, 
heavily grown terrain, ambled, 
moving both legs on the same 
side together. And Takeko 
was lovely. 

Hartford decided to essay 
his Kansan. He practiced his 



question: "Is Yamamura far 
from here?” mentally, moving 
his lips, until he was sure he’d 
mastered the phrasing. Then 
he addressed Old Kiwa. 
" Yamamura wa koko *kara toi 
desu ka?” 

Kiwa smiled, and rattled off 
an answer much too brisk for 
Hartford to catch. He pointed 
ahead and up. "He says we 
must go through the pass, un- 
der the Great Buddha,” Take- 
ko explained. "We have only 
an hour to go.” 

" Arigato ,” Hartford said, 
suppressing a moan. Another 
hour ! 

The pass Kiwa had spoken 
of loomed ahead. It was quite 
narrow, and walled on either 
side by the almost perpendic- 
ular flanks of mountains, 
shoulder to shoulder. Kiwa 
went first, for the cleft could 
only be negotiated in single 
file. Takeko followed her fa- 
ther, and Hartford took up the 
rear. In the ravine it was dark. 
The camelopards, sensing 
their mangers up ahead, paced 
more quickly. Suddenly the 
canyon was light, the walls 
spreading further apart here. 

Far up on Hartford’s right, 
seated on a shelf left from 
some ancient avalanche, was a 
gigantic figure cast of a cop- 
pery metal, green now against 
the granite wall. "Who is 
that?” Hartford called to Ta- 
keko. 

"It is our Daibutsu” Take- 
ko said. "It is the Amida Bud- 
dha, the Lord of Boundless 
Light.” 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 



71 




“Do you worship him?” 
Takeko smiled and shook 
her head. “We worship not 
any man, but a Way,” she 
said. “ Butsudo — the Way of 
the Buddha. We are nearly to 
the village now, Lee-san.” 

“I thank the Lord Buddha 
for that,” Hartford said, bow- 
ing from his saddle toward 
the great bronze image. 

Y AMAMURA nestled in a 
fold of the high moun- 
tains. The fields that support- 
ed the village, its population 
now doubled by the refugees 
from Kansannamura, were 
tucked here and there on nar- 
row ledges, watered by bam- 
boo flumes that stole water 
from the mountain streams. 
The crop of greatest impor- 
tance was the ubiquitous sun- 
flower, supplier of bread and 
soap ash, of cloth and bath 
oil, birdseed and writing pa- 
per. Bamboo grew in clefts 
and shelves too slight for cul- 
tivation. This was the wood 
for tools, the water pipe, the 
house wattles and, in its 
youth, the salad of the people, 
the only wood eaten in its na- 
tive state. There were also 
carrots, beets and tiny plum- 
trees, and the horseradish, 
daikon. Yamamura was a love- 
ly place, Hartford decided. 

It was twenty hours from 
the moment of his contamina- 
tion that Hartford dismount- 
ed. He moved into the house 
Kiwa invited him to with as 
much tenderness as though 
he’d been carefully bastin- 



adoed and flayed. He was, 
nonetheless, free of febrile 
symptoms. He had breathed 
Kansan air, had eaten its fish 
and drunk its water; he’d 
spoken with a Kansan native 
and had lain with his face in 
Kansan dust. He was still as 
healthy as any Axenite, never 
before in the saddle, would be 
after a five-hour ride. 

Kiwa’s wife and Takeko’s 
mother was a little woman 
named Toyomi-san, dressed in 
brightly patterned garments a 
good deal more formal than 
her daughter’s jacket and 
shorts. Toyomi-san spoke no 
Standard, but she made quite 
clear to Hartford his welcome. 
She led him into a large, 
steam-filled room, where she 
indicated he was first to wash 
himself then soak, then dry 
and dress in the clean clothing 
she’d laid out for his use. 

The soaking water was very 
hot, and very welcome. Hart- 
ford sat in the copper-bot- 
tomed tub, his muscles hard 
and sore, until he felt the very 
marrow of his bones had 
cooked. He stepped from the 
tub then and dried gently, 
easy on his chafed back and 
legs. 

"The oil will help,” Takeko 
said, slipping a screen shut 
behind her. She had bathed 
and brushed her black hair 
free of the bamboo-thicket 
dust, and wore now a brilliant, 
silk kimono of the sort her 
mother was wearing. 

Hartford held the towel at 
his waist.

“Excuse me,” he said. 
Takeko giggled. “Are you 
unique, Lee-san, that you 
must hide yourself? Lie down 
on the cot, and I will make 
you comfortable.” 

Wondering greatly at the 
folkways of Kansas, but de- 
termined to commit no gaffe 
that would imperil his rela- 
tions with this girl, Hartford 
lay face down on the mat-cov- 
ered cot. Takeko removed the 
tenugi towel with which he'd 
modestly draped himself and 
gently stroked sweet-scented 
sunflower-seed oil into his 
macerated skin. Using the 
radical border of her hands, 
which were remarkably 
strong, Takeko coaxed the 
muscles to relax with effleu- 
rage; and she further softened 
the clonic hardness with a 
kneading motion. “This is,” 
she said, working her thumb- 
knuckles up his spinal-column 
as though telling the beads of 
his vertebrae, “one of the 
good things my ancestors 
brought from earth.” 

“ Yoroshiku soro ” Hartford 
grunted agreement. “It is 
good.” 

H ALF an hour later, his 
skin soothed with oil and 
his muscles suppled by Take- 
ko’s massage, Hartford joined 
the family for supper. The 
Kansans used paired sticks for 
eating. Hartford, who’d not 
yet been introduced to the 
skill of using these o-hashi, 
and who was too hungry to 
practice now, was given a 



metal spoon with which to eat. 

When they'd finished their 
meal, several elder Kansans 
entered Kiwa-san’s house. 
Each bowed to Hartford, who, 
bald-headed, his feet socked 
into unfamiliar geta and wear- 
ing mitten-toed stockings, 
bowed in return. The new- 
comers each spoke some 
Standard, but it was obvious 
that Takeko was the most flu- 
ent of them all. “Pia-san 
taught Renkei; Renkei taught 
me,” the girl explained. “I was 
the second-best speaker. It 
would be better if Renkei 
were here.” 

“I regret his death more 
deeply than I can tell you,” 
Hartford said. “Renkei and 
Pia my friend are both dead 
now. This is what Renkei told 
me: aru-majiki koto , a thing 
that ought not to be.” 

The Kansans, seated on the 
cushions about the room, 
nodded. “Do you know, Lee- 
san, the greatest law of life?” 
Takeko asked. 

“You said, beside the stream 
where we fished, that men do 
not kill men,” Hartford an- 
swered. “But they do.” 

“It is an ideal we have more 
nearly than the glass-heads,” 
one of the Kansan elders said. 
“In the past four days, Ren- 
kei has died, and Pia-san. In 
the years before you Latecom- 
ers came to build the Stone 
House and cut roads and prac- 
tice making holes in paper at 
a distance, no man died here 
at the hand of another.” 

“We cannot teach the glass-

heads our way when they walk 
about only with guns, when 
they live in the Stone House 
none of us can enter without 
dying, when they look at us 
with glass bowls over their 
faces and hate in their 
hearts,” Takeko said. 

“The hate is hardly need- 
ful,” Hartford said. “But the 
helmets must remain if Axen- 
ites are to live on Kansas.” 

“Do you live?” Takeko 
asked quietly. 

“I do,” Hartford said. “It 
puzzles me.” 

“Does it not puzzle you that 
none of us harbors open sores, 
or coughs up phlegm, or dies 
of fever?” Kiwa asked, speak- 
ing through his daughter’s in- 
termediation. 

“I had not thought of that,” 
Hartford admitted. “I have 
never before lived so. close to 
Stinkers.” Embarrassed, he 
stopped short. “I'm sorry,” he 
said. “Shitsurei shimashita ” 

“You meant us no dis- 
co u r t e s y,” Takeko said. 
“Think, Lee, of the word you 
used. Do we indeed stink?” 

“No,” Hartford said. “It's 
strange. I've been told all my 
life of the rot and fermenta- 
tion within ordinary mam- 
mals, and of the evil smells 
elaborated by these processes. 
But you, and all of Kansas, 
stink no more than Axenites 
do. You have, as we, the mul- 
berry odor of saliva, the wheat 
smell of thiamin, the faint 
musk oil of the hair. Even 
your camelopards smell 
sweet.” 



T HE girl laughed. “If you 
think all Kansas a place of 
sweet perfumes, smell this, 
Lee-san,” she said. She took a 
covered dish and opened it. 
“This is takuwan/* she said. 
A smell strong as that of 
limburger cheese made itself 
known in the room. “It is 
pickled turnip, made in the 
old manner of our island 
forefathers on Earth.” 

“Whew!” Hartford said. 
“There is the true Stinker of 
Kansas.” 

“Pia-san learned much from 
the bad-smelling takuwan /* 
Takeko said. “His wife knew 
about the small stink-makers, 
these bacteria; she was a user 
of microscopes. She looked 
for them in the air of Kansas, 
and in our soil. Pia-san went 
even further. He took drops of 
our blood and other things to 
test.” 

“Tell our guest, Take-chan, 
what Pia found,” Old Kiwa 
told his daughter. 

“Hai, O t o s a n .” The girl 
turned to Hartford. “In our 
bodies there are no mischief- 
makers of the sort Earth-peo- 
ple know. There are not even 
those juices Pia-san called 
‘footprints of the bugs.' ” 

“He must have meant you 
have no bacterial antibodies,” 
Hartford said. “That explains 
the whole package,” he went 
on, with growing excitement. 
“Why I'm alive without my 
safety-suit. What Piacentelli

Hartford rocked back from 
the microscope to sit again on 
his heels. “You have no dis- 
ease, no benign bacterial flora 
and of course no bacterial an- 
tibodies. Instead you have 
this whip-tailed animalcule, 
this monad. Is this correct?” 

“So Pia-san said,” Takeko 
agreed. “He said that the 
monad is a jealous beast. It 
is a tiger among the pygmies, 
he said. No little nuisance- 
makers can exist on Kansas; 
the monad would eat them in 
a rage.” 

“The ultimate antibiotic,” 
Hartford said. “A micro- 
organism that functions as a 
saprophyte, a soil-former and 
a scavenger. Besides all this, 
it’s a universal phagocyte, 
policing up the human en- 
vironment inside and out, to 
keep it clean of any other mi- 
croscopic organisms. The 
monad fills every niche in the 
micro-ecology of the planet.” 

“This is what Pia-san and 
his okusama, poor dead girl, 
discovered,” Takeko said. 
“Renkei entered the Stone 
House to tell you that we do 
not stink, that we are not dan- 
gerous. Three people have 
died to tell this — and Nef still 
does not know.” 

“I think he may know it af- 
ter all,” Hartford said. “He 
knows about the monad, and 
fears it. This little bug means 
that every member of the hu- 
man race can join his damned 
Brotherhood. A crew of 
monads in his gut would make 
every man on Stinker Earth 

76 



a dignotobiote, germ-free ex- 
cept for his housekeeping pro- 
tozoa. 

“Until Pia-san told us,” Ya- 
mata said, “we knew nothing 
except that we lived longer 
than our ancestors had. We 
knew that we did not suffer 
from the strange tirednesses 
the books told of, ills caused 
by the little animals. We did 
not know that the smallest na- 
tives of this planet had made 
of us. their fortresses.” 

“If I could only get past 
Nasty Nef to tell this to the 
Axenites,” Hartford said. 

“Ron yori shoko ” Kiwa-san 
said. Takeko translated for 
her father. “He says, Proof is 
stronger than argument.” 
“Indeed,” Hartford agreed. 
“But how do I prove to the 
troopers that the monad 
sweeps Kansas cleaner than 
their Barracks floors?” 

“As Pia-san tried to,” Take- 
ko said. “He removed his 
glasshead and his silken suit. 
He breathed our air and ate 
our food. He wanted to prove 
that he could live, but he was 
killed before he could. Now 
you have made that proof. 
Your brothers of the Stone 
House must undress of their 
silken suits and come among 
us, Lee-san.” 

{{'THAT they will not,” 
A Hartford said. “They 
are certain they will die if 
they inhale a breath of Kan- 
sas air, chew a bite of Kansas 
food, drink your clear stream 
water. I was certain I would 

by Allen Kim Lang 




die when my safety-suit was 
torn : remember our meeting, 
Takeko-san? It will not be 
easy to persuade my brothers 
and sisters in the Barracks to 
forget their fears. We are so 
sure, we Axenites, that con- 
tamination will kill us that 
we’d rather dance with light- 
ning and eat stones than walk 
this world unprotected and 
eat its fruits.” 

When Takeko had respoken 
these words to her father, the 
old man said again : “Ron yori 
skoko” Proof is greater than 
argrment. 

“Proof?” Hartford asked. “I 
am not proof enough to have 
a Regiment of Axenites shed 
their safety-suits and declare 
the Kansans their brothers. It 
would take years of lab work 
before the first of them would 
walk suitless onto bug-dirt. 
We’d have to knock down the 
walls of the Barracks and burn 
two thousand-odd safety-suits, 
before we’d have the Axenite 
troopers here trapped into be- 
ing guinea-pigs.” 

“Each trooper carries the 
Stone House with him when 
he walks our roads,” the calli- 
grapher remarked. “We have 
but to break through the silk- 
en suit he wears to make a 
trooper know the garment 
isn’t needed here.” 

“He’d die of fright,” Hart- 
ford said. “I very nearly did. 
Besides, each column of troop- 
ers, a squad or the Regiment, 
goes out with a Decontamina- 
tion Team. If a man becomes 
septic through some sort of 



accident, he’s hustled by a 
cleanup squad into a Decon- 
tamination Vehicle for his 
shower, shave and shots. I 
know the process well,” he 
said, running his palm over 
his naked head. 

“A no ne,” Kiwa said. “Will 
this Decontamination-fcuru/na 
house two thousand men? 
Two hundred? Twenty?” 

“It will hold two or three 
troopers at once,” Hartford 
answered. “We have several 
of them, though.” 

“So. ka ?” white - bearded 
Togo exclaimed. He leaned 
over to whisper into the ear 
of Takeko’s father, who nod- 
ded and smiled. 

Old Kiwa spoke, and Take- 
ko interpreted. “We must sur- 
prise a group of troopers,” he 
said. “We must cause all their 
silken suits to be torn, or all 
their glass heads shattered, at 
one time. It is so simple as 
that.” 

“Simple in all but the do- 
ing,” said Yamata the calli- 
grapher. He picked up a brush 
and sketched on the mat be- 
fore him a line of trooper-sil- 
houettes, a platoon, marching 
single-file. “How do we break 
into all those Stone Houses at 
once?” he asked. 

Hartford’s face was pale. 
“We could use grenades, per- 
haps,” he said. “Or bombs. Af- 
ter all, these troopers we 
speak of are no more than my 
family, my village, my people. 
I may of course be expected 
to cooperate in their destruc- 
tion.” 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS

T AKEKO reached over and 
took his hand, then 
dropped it. “ Ano ne! You do 
not understand! We can no 
more injure your brothers 
than you can, Lee-san. We 
may not harm any living per- 
son. Forgive us. You misun- 
derstand us. We are bound, 
Lee-sensei, by Butsudo : the 
Peaceful Path of the Lord 
Buddha.” She bowed toward 
him, her hands clasped togeth- 
er, her head touching the ta- 
tami. 

“It is my fault if I have 
misunderstood,” Hartford 
said. The men were staring, 
Takeko’s eyes were filled with 
tears, the room was silent. “I 
do not know you well. I did 
not know you do not kill.” 
“Let me tell you, then,” Ta- 
keko said, rising to sit beside 
him. “Our people, who once 
lived on islands in the greater 
sea of Earth, were folk 
mighty in battle. Their pride 
was named the Way of the 
Warrior, which is called Bu- 
shido. Their loveliest flower, 
the sakura or cherry-blossom, 
they made the symbol of the 
warrior, so highly did they 
hold his calling. 

“After their villages had 
been crushed many times in 
war, our ancestbrs vowed for- 
ever to abandon Bushido , the 
warrior’s path, and to place 
their feet in the path of the 
Lord Buddha, called Butsudo. 
This was many years ago, be- 
fore any man had ventured 
into space, before our ances- 
tors found this world you call 



Kansas. When they came 
here, they came in peace. And 
they named this place Jodo , 
which we still call it. It 
means the Pure Land, where 
men are just. And all justice 
is built on a single law. No 
man shall take man’s life.” 

“I spoke of the Axenite 
Brotherhood,” Hartford said. 
“These men are a group of 
our leaders — Colonel Nef is 
one ; he invited me to join him 
— who have decided that 
Stinker humanity must go. 
They’re dedicated men, pre- 
pared to extinguish all the 
rest of mankind, to sterilize 
Earth and reseed it as a gno- 
tobiotopic Paradise. Nef has, I 
fear, already killed three peo- 
ple to this end. 

“Yo,u who cannot kill will 
face an enemy trained in kill- 
ing,” he went on. “Your camel- 
opard-mounted messengers 
will meet veeto-platforms with 
machine-guns. Your peaceful 
words will be drowned out by 
the roar of Dardick-rifles. 
How can you hope to live if 
you will not kill?” 

“If the choice were death or 
killing, Lee-san, we would 
gladly die,” Takeko said. “We 
have a saying, Muriga toreba 
dori ga hikkomu. When might 
takes charge justice with- 
draws. We will not kill, and 
neither will we be defeated.” 
Yamata the calligrapher ad- 
dressed Hartford. “How badly 
torn must a safety-suit be, to 
make necessary the wearer’s 
going into the purification 
cart?” he asked. 



78

“Only so much as the point 
of a pin would make would be 
enough,’ ” Hartford said. 

“We have to drive pins into 
several dozens of men's cloth- 
ing at one time," Yamata said. 
He smiled. “So phrased, the 
mountain does not seem too 
tall to be climbed." 

“It would be difficult to 
puncture the safety-suits 
without hurting the wearers," 
Hartford said. “Few armies 
are so solicitous." 

“ Butsudo forbids us to kill 
men," Takeko said. “It does 
not deny us the right, in 
pointing them to the path of 
knowledge, to jab them a bit." 
She smiled at Hartford. 

CCY TOW do you propose to 
do this jabbing?" he 
asked. “I remind you all, if 
you need reminding, that our 
troopers travel with Dardick- 
rifles and machine-guns, with 
rocket-mounted jeeps and vee- 
to-platforms from which 
bombs can be dropped." 

Kiwa spoke. “We are like a 
bear after honey," he said. 
“We are hungry, but do not 
wish to taste the stings of the 
guardians of the hive. We 
must surprise them.” 

Hartford, his knees stiff 
with kneeling, his backside 
sore from the camelopard-sad- 
dle despite the expert mas- 
sage, got up to pace the floor. 
“We need a needle-gun of 
some sort," he said. 

“No gun," insisted white- 
bearded Togo. 

“It need have only slight 



power," Hartford said. “It 
would throw its projectile 
only forcefully enough to 
penetrate the fabric of a safe- 
ty-suit." 

“It has been so many gener- 
ations since we have been sol- 
diers, we know nothing of 
weapons," Yamata-san said. He 
wet a fine brush with sumi, 
Chinese ink, and sketched 
rapidly. “I remember seeing 
pictures of Bushi carrying a 
sort of throwing-sticks with 
pointed ends in pockets on 
their backs, and flinging them 
like little spears with a kind 
of one-stringed lute." 

Hartford stared at the calli- 
grapher’s drawing, then ex- 
claimed. “Of course ! A bow 
and arrow." 

Takeko inspected the 
sketch. “The man who threw 
the stick is standing,” she 
said. “Could we stand against 
troopers?" 

“A man would have to stand 
exposed to shoot an arrow," 
Hartford admitted. “The Dar- 
dick-guns would mow us down 
before we’d punctured a sin- 
gle safety-suit." He paced up 
and down the room, the only 
trained warrior there, trying 
to devise his unkilling weap- 
on. 

“We have wine, Lee-san,” 
Takeko said. “Please sit and 
drink." 

Hartford, bemused with his 
problem, folded his legs onto 
his cushion and lowered him- 
self gently. Takeko’s mother 
appeared with tiny cups of 
hot wine, sake. Hartford

bowed with the others and 
sipped. The stuff was good, 
rather like a dry sherry. 

Takeko bowed to leave the 
room, returned, bowed and 
commenced playing a tune 
with the instrument she’d 
brought in. It was a flute 
made of bamboo, with a high- 
pitched, pure sound Hartford 
found quite pleasant. He 
frowned, though, after a mo- 
ment. Takeko took the pipe 
from her lips. “You do not en- 
joy my playing?” she asked. 

“What is that made of?” 
Hartford demanded "Just 
bamboo, isn’t it?” 

“ Hai , take ,” Takeko agreed. 
“It is my name. Take — bam- 
boo. This is only a shakuha- 
chi\ for very simple music.” 
Hartford smiled and bowed 
toward Togo-san, the white- 
bearded carpenter. “S: : r,” he 
said, “if we may have your ad- 
vice, I believe Takeko-chan 
has helped us find our weap- 
on.” 

X 

T HE meeting broke up to 
adjourn to Togo-san's 
workshop. There was bamboo 
there in plenty, and young 
men eager to help the ex-lieu- 
tenant of Axenites in testing 
hts device. As the week wore 
on, young Kansans appeared 
from other villages, called by 
blabrigars and messengers on 
camelopard-back to join the 
army that was to make broth- 
ers and sisters of the troopers 
of First Regiment. 



The blowgun Hartford fi- 
nally established as his field 
model was some two yards 
long, made of bamboo bored 
through the joints and pol- 
ished smooth within, of a. cal- 
iber somewhat less than the 
diameter of a man’s little fin- 
ger. Though the bamboo-tube 
was somewhat flexible, Togo- 
san and his apprentices were 
able to bind a front sight to 
the muzzle, allowing some- 
what greater accuracy that 
could be obtained by pointing 
and hop'ng. 

The dart was about the 
length of a man’s hand. Its 
point was a sliver of bamboo, 
sharp as steel, entirely sharp 
enough to penetrate the tough 
material of a safety-suit if 
puffed from the blowgun with 
enough force. 

All the craftsmen of the 
village became arms-makers. 
They drilled bamboo, pob’shed 
the bore with abrasive-coated 
cord, fitted on the sights and 
tested their blowguns against 
the targets. Hundreds of darts 
were turned out for practice, 
and the most perfect were, 
saved for the battlefield it- 
self. The blowgunners began 
their drill, shooting from a 
prone position at targets as 
far as ten yards off, as great 
a range as amateurs cou 7 d be 
expected to shoot with accura- 
cy in the short time these had 
for practice. 

To fire the blowgun, the 
dart was wrapped in a bit of 
silk of sunflower-stalk-fluff, 
so that it would fit tightly 



80

into the tube. The puff that 
sent it on its way had to be 
sharp and hard. Achieving the 
proper slap of air took more 
practice even than aiming. 

Hartford became every day 
a better horseman, or rather 
camelopardist. He in fact re- 
joiced in opportunities to leap- 
frog into his saddle, fit his 
feet and legs into the leather 
gambadoes, and go hailing off 
into the hills to recruit men 
and material. He carried with 
him the radio he’d salvaged 
from his safety suit, and could 
from time to time pick up 
First Regiment transmissions. 
The bitcher from his suit was 
useful in training large num- 
bers of recruits on the blow- 
gun range, and would be used 
when the Kansan guerrillas 
took the field against the 
troopers. He was picking up 
the language rapidly, now. He 
had to use Takeko’s services 
as interpreter less and less. 
Her usefulness declined not a 
bit, though, as the girl became 
his first lieutenant in charge 
of details. 

The band of expert puff- 
gunners was joined by a com- 
pany of scouts. These men and 
women skulked the hills afoot 
or astride camelopards, spying 
out the programs of the Regi- 
ment. Having no radio to 
maintain contact with Yama- 
mura, each scout carried a pair 
of blabrigars, trained to report 
to a specific person in its 
home village when given a se- 
lected prompt-word. 

Yamata-sah, the calligra- 



pher, became a cartographer. 
He drew in jet-black sumi ink 
the contours of the mountains, 
greened in the stands of bam- 
boo, drew blue streams and 
broad brown fields of sun- 
flowers, till at last the map 
that filled the largest room in 
Yamamura was almost as real 
as the Kansan soil it reflect- 
ed. Walking across this map 
in his tabi -stockinged feet, 
Hartford and the others of 
Kansas Intelligence would 
move toy troopers, made of 
wood like kokeshi-dolls, into 
the positions where the blabri- 
gars reported patrols to be. 

T HE plan of battle of the 
Kansas forces was yawara - 
do , the Gentle Way also called 
judo. They would wait till the 
enemy made a move they 
could use, then they’d trip him 
up by re-directing his own 
strength. 

The move they most wanted 
the troopers to make was into 
the ravine that led toward the 
village of Yamamura, the pass 
under the Daibutsu , the huge 
bronze Buddha set there by 
their ancestors. In that ravine, 
under the gaze of the Lord of 
Boundless Light, the Kansas 
forces would either prevail 
againt the invader and make 
him their brother by darts and 
sweet reason, or they would 
all die in the attempt. 

The camelopards were sta- 
bled, ready as the steeds of 
any march-patrolling cavalry 
troop. The dartsmen, and 
those of the women who’d 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 



81 




shown skill in handling the 
blowgun, were trained and 
eager. The path through the 
pass had been memorized in 
infinite detail by every one of 
the guerrillas. The squad of 
sappers responsible for check- 
mating the troopers had pre- 
pared their levers, their blocks 
and skids. Nothing remained 
now but to coax the enemy 
into the battlefield of the 
Kansans’ choosing. 

“Take out what’s left of the 
safety-suit,” Hartford ordered 
one of his men. “Leave it 
here — ” He stabbed a toe at 
the map they both stood on. 

“Would it be well for me to 
leave beside the torn and 
broken suit signs of a fight?” 
asked the boy, Ito Tiro, son of 
Old Ito-san, the knife-maker. 
“If the troopers are angry, 
they will be careless.” 

“If only you believed in 
war, Jiro-chan, you’d make a 
fine warrior,” Hartford 
grinned. “Do it your way, and 
hurry back.” 

Jiro placed the bait under 
the Regiment’s nose early in 
the day, and returned to Ya- 
mamura. It was midday when 
a blabrigar flew in from one 
of the scouts posted to watch 
First Regiment’s reaction. 
The bird prated its message 
into the ear of its receiver. 
Troopers, a band of fifty-odd, 
were scouring the hills to the 
west, following the camelo- 
pard-hoofprints left by Jiro. 
Aiding them in their search 
was the Regiment’s veeto-plat- 
form, skimming, hovering, 



pouncing to pick up clues. 
“They’re on the scent,” Hart- 
ford said. He turned again to 
Ito Jiro, fleetest of the camel- 
opard-riders. “Jiro-chan, lead 
them a chase that will bring 
them to the ravine no sooner 
than the Hour of the Dog. Be 
very cautious of the flying- 
thing; it can surprise you.” 
“//a/,” Jiro said, bowing. 
“The Hour of the Dog they 
will call upon you near the 
Daibutsu” Ito-san the knife- 
maker watched his son run to- 
ward the stables, the boy as 
excited as though he were go- 
ing to a festival rather than to 
face alone half a company of 
full-armed Axenites. The bla- 
brigars that would ride out 
with Jito were trained to re- 
port to the father. It would be 
a long afternoon for the old 
man, Hartford thought. 

There was much to do be- 
fore the scarlet bird came 
winging in from Jiro’s shoul- 
der with the message that the 
trap was sprung. At the Hour 
of the Monkey, four hours be- 
fore the troopers were to be 
in ambush, the first blabrigar 
flew in to report to Ito-san 
that the boy’s mount was 
winded, the enemy was draw- 
ing nearer the ravine, and that 
Jiro was approaching the 
point of rendezvous where he 
would find a fresh camelo- 
pard. Hartford ordered out 
two youths to join Jiro there 
in his harassment of the foot- 
soldiers from Regiment. 

- “It is time we take up our 
positions,” he told his band of 



82

dartsmen. “Let us go in hope.” 

K IWA-SAN, Takeko’s fa- 
ther, stepped forward to 
pronounce a benediction upon 
the little company. “The En- 
lightened One, speaking at 
Rajagriha, spake, saying: ‘Re- 
member one thing, O beloved 
disciples, that hatred cannot 
be silenced by lies but by 
truth.* ” 

The irregulars, heads 
bowed, replied, “Namu Amida 
Butsu,** Glory to the Amida 
Buddha! Hartford, though his 
training as an Axenite trooper 
had left him as untouched by 
religions as by microbes, 
joined the prayer, feeling that 
a degree of celestial interest 
in their stratagem would not 
be unwelcome. 

The camelopardists vaulted 
into their saddles, adjusted 
their legs in the bootlike 
gambadoes, and slapped the 
reins to head their giraffu to- 
ward the ravine where the 
endgame would be played. 
Hartford rode at the head of 
the band, Takeko beside him. 
The others were dispersed at 
wide interval, a precaution 
against the veeto-platform’s 
swooping over the horizon to 
surprise them en route. As 
they left Yamamura, the wom- 
en and children of the village 
were leaving from the other 
side, together with the men 
too old to go out with the 
guerrillas. Yamamura was be- 
ing abandoned until the out- 
come of battle made itself 
known. 



The canyon that led up the 
mountain’s groin had once 
been the deep-cut bed of a 
stream. Collapse of over-bee- 
tling rock had formed a vault 
over the stream, which was 
consequently underground. 
Soil had filtered into the 
rocks, and bamboo had taken 
root. In result the lower ra- 
vine was a green enfilade 
hardly wider than a hallway, 
the walls on either side rising 
squarely from its floor. Well 
within the pass, set into the 
left-hand wall as one rode 
down from Yamamura, was a 
niche very like the tokonoma 
or honored alcove of a Kansan 
home. In this alcove, some fif- 
ty feet from the bottom of the 
pass, was set the great bronze 
image of Buddha, the Daibut- 
su of Kansas. 

Further down, below the 
Daibutsu- niche, the canyon 
became irregular. Along either 
side, some ten feet from the 
floor, were ledges marking the 
fracture planes along which 
ancient avalanches had calved. 
It was from these shelves that 
the Kansans hoped to ambush 
the men from First Regiment. 
The narrowness of the ravine, 
and the overhang of willow 
trees — these growing in clefts 
of rock, fingering their roots 
down to the subterranean 
stream — were enough, Hart- 
ford prayed, to prevent the 
veeto-platform’s pilot from 
spotting the Kansans lying in 
wait with their blowguns. 

Hartford disposed his 
troops on the shelves, check-

in g to see that each man had 
a good field of fire and ade- 
quate cover. He glanced at the 
sun, the Kansan timepiece. It 
was between six and eight in 
the evening, he judged, the 
Hour of the Clock. He pressed 
his ear to the radio-receiver. 
Short-range, the safety-suit 
radio picked up only occasion- 
al orders from Axenite offi- 
cers and non-coms. Twice 
Hartford caught the name, 
“Lieutenant Felix.” He 
smiled, feeling mixed emo- 
tions. Felix had been his old 
Platoon Sergeant, and they 
would face each other in an 
hour or so as enemies. Very 
likely the fifty troopers chas- 
ing Ito Juro and his fellows 
toward the canyon included 
men of the Terrible Third 
Platoon, his old command. 
Hartford checked to see his 
bitcher worked and waited the 
arrival of the message-blabri- 
gars with fresh news. 

XI 

T HE first bird arrived a few 
moments before the radio 
began coming in clear. 

“Sakura” Hartford said, 
this being the prompt-word to 
which the blabrigar was 
trained to reply. 

“Fifty men, sir; fifty men, 
sir; on the way, sir; on the 
way, sir,” the bird chanted 
into Hartford's ear. He let the 
bird rest on his shoulder; it 
would have to fly back to the 
scout who'd sent it soon, to 
tell him to join the rest of 



them at the ambush-point. 

The sun was low in the sky. 
H-hour was near. The signals 
began coming closer-together. 
“Saw one Stinker off your left 
flank, Miller... Left flank- 
guard reporting, sir. That 
Gook took off due east. Bla- 
brigar on his shoulder. 
Lieutenant Felix here. Any- 
thing on the right flank?... 
Nothing, sir... Keep moving, 
Lieutenant.” This last voice 
was the colonel's. 

Hartford frowned. If Nasty 
Nef had come out in person, 
the game would have to be 
played fast and dirty. 

Hartford set his bitcher low. 
“Abunai yo !” he said to his 
guerrillas, sprawled out all 
along the ledge like figurines 
on a mantlepiece. “Be cau- 
tious. Shoot your dart and get 
behind something. From now 
on, be silent. The enemy is 
near.” 

Takeko spoke: “You mean, 
Lee-chan, that our brothers 
draw near.” The other Kan- 
sans smiled. Some saluted, a 
gesture they'd observed 
among the Axenites they’d 
been spying upon for the past 
few days. 

The first of the scouts came 
galloping up the gullet of the 
canyon. Without a sound he 
signaled his watching com- 
rades, invisible above him. He 
made a circle with his hand, 
pointing up. That meant the 
Regiment’s veeto-p latf orm 
was scouting ahead of the ap- 
proaching Axenites. The first 
man slapped his giraffu to

hasten it up the pass, past the 
Daibutsu. Two other scouts, 
the foxes urging on the 
hounds, came shouting into 
the canyon. Neither of them 
was Ito Jiro. As his name 
signified, Jiro was the young- 
est son of Ito-san, the knife- 
maker. He was the darling of 
the family. Where was he? 
Hartford worried. 

The radio, no longer masked 
by the rocks, was filled with 
information. Hartford heard 
the veeto-pilot reporting: 
“They're headed up the gulch 
past the big idol, sir,” he said. 
“There's a village up there. 
That's where they’re probably 
headed. What do you want me 
to do, sir?" The platform 
hovered over the canyon, un- 
willing to work its way into 
the jagged, bamboo-and-pine- 
prickly fissure. 

“Keep in touch, Sky-Eye," 
Nef ordered. “We’re coming 
right up.” 

“Felix here, sir," the lieu- 
tenant reported. “We’ve got 
one of the Gooks prisoner. 
He's just a kid. Doesn’t seem 
to know a thing." ■% 

“Hold him till we get some- 
one who talks Stinker," Nef 
said. 

They got Jiro, Hartford 
thought. Damn. 

T HE first of the troopers, 
an officer in the blue safe- 
ty-suit, spearheaded the col- 
umn. “Nothing in sight yet," 
Felix's voice reported. The 
officer signaled “Come on” 
with the sweep of his arm, and 



the first squad of Axenites, 
dispersed as skirmishers, 
formed themselves into a file 
to enter the canyon. The vee- 
to-platform above kept the 
foliage pressed down with its 
jet of air, stirring dust that 
both improved concealment 
and threatened to trigger a 
sneeze from one of the am* 
bushers. 

Hartford peered cautiously 
over the edge of the shelf. 
He’d set his forces far enough 
back in the canyon that the 
entire Axenite column would 
be encased. “Sir, this is Fe- 
lix," the radio said. “Do you 
agree, sir, that I should place 
one squad in reserve till the 
rest get through the gully?" 

“Peel off one squad and stay 
with it, Felix," Nef said. 

Felix’s voice again: “Sir, it 
was our Lieutenant Hartford 
that the Gooks got. I’d like to 
go in early." 

“Very well, Felix. Miller, 
hold your squad where it is. 
Disperse them well, and wait 
my order before bringing 
them into the ditch. Confirm." 

“Done and done, sir," Miller 
snapped. 

The first two dozen troop- 
ers were in the canyon now, 
half the Axenite force. Colo- 
nel Nef had shown the good 
sense to don an ordinary blue 
safety-suit; his scarlet com- 
mand-suit would have made 
him a splendid target. Anoth- 
er squad entered, their Dar- 
dick-rifles held at the ready. 
This would have to be quick, 
Hartford thought, or he’d lose 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 



85 




his entire corps at their first 
volley. He raised his hand, a 
signal visible only to Takeko. 
She cupped her hands around 
her mouth and whistled the 
call of the nightingale, “Ho-o- 
kekyo . kekyo !" 

Before the echoed notes had 
died, the darts had found their 
targets. 

The radio was a clutter of 
undisciplined Damn's, cries of 
“I've been hit!" One trooper, 
quicker than the rest, caught 
sight of a Kansan. He raised 
his rifle and purred out a 
stream of Dardick-pellets. 
Yoritomo, apprentice to the 
paper-maker, tumbled over the 
lip of the ledge, his blowpipe 
falling with him like a jack- 
straw. There was a babble on 
the radio. Nef overrode all 
other circuits to command : 
“At ease! Rake the ledges 
with sustained fire." 

The canyon was blasted 
with a confetti of metal and 
spalled rock as the troopers 
hosed the shelves with bullets. 

The angle made aiming im- 
possible. But by luck and the 
intensity of the barrage an- 
other man, the carpenter’s 
son, had toppled to his death. 

“Sky -Eye! Get your 
butt down here!" Nef 
bellowed. “Decontamination 
Team! Bring the vehicle to 
the mouth of the canyon. 
We've got men septic." He 
tongued-on his bitcher and 
bellowed at the troopers. “On 
the double, through the 
ditch." 

“Yuke!” Hartford shouted 



to the men far up the wall, 
in the niche that held the Dai- 
butsu. “Go!" 

T HE sappers at the back of 
the giant bronze statue 
bent to their levers. The tons 
of metal scooted slowly for- 
ward, hit the fat-smeared edge 
of the shelf. As quietly as a 
man rocking forward in 
prayer, the Daibutsu dropped 
head-down into the ravine. It 
struck the bottom with the 
sound of a great gong, and 
rocked, unshattered, plugging 
the throat of the canyon, 
standing as a dam. The hands 
of the Enlightened One were 
held in the positions of Pro- 
tection and of Giving; His 
face bore still a quiet smile. 
About the head of the image 
a fountain of water burst, 
squeezed up from the stream 
below. “ Nainu Amida ButsuT 
Takeko said, cuddled against 
Hartford, staring down. 

“Keep down," he said. He 
lifted his suit-radio and 
flicked on the transmission- 
switch. “This is Lee Hartford, 
late of the First Regiment," 
he announced. “The safety- 
suits of most of you have been 
breached. There is not room 
for more than three of you in 
the Decontamination Vehicle. 
You are not septic. I repeat: 
you have not been contaminat- 
ed. Kansas is as safe for you 
as the Barracks, or Titan, or 
the M’Bwene planets, or in 
the cells at Luna. You do not 
need your safety-suits on Kan-

“Find that man and gun the 
traitor down,” Net's voice de- 
manded from the speaker on 
his suit. 

“I am coming out unarmed,” 
Hartford radioed. 

“Fire the moment you see 
him,” Nef said. One of the 
officers had his Dardick- 
pistol drawn, his eyes travers- 
ing the canyon walls. 

“No, sir!” Felix's voice 
snapped from his bitcher. 
“You can't shoot the man till 
he's had a chance to speak.” 

“Go to the rear at once, 
Private Felix,” Nef bellowed. 

Felix pointed his handgun 
toward Nef. “No, sir,” he re- 
plied. “Hartford was my C.O., 
and an honest man. I'll hear 
him before I see him killed. 
Or by my life, sir, I'll kill you 
after him.” 

* “This is treason,” Nef said. 

“Drop your pistol, sir, or I'll 
have to try to shoot it from 
your hand. Excuse me, sir,” 
Felix said. 

Nef's gun dropped. 

“You all hear me?” Felix 
bitched. “Hear me out there, 
Miller?” There was a chorus 
of “Roger!” Felix went on: 
“I'm going to unclam my hel- 
met, troopers. I'm going to 
take off my safety-suit. That's 
how much I trust Lee Hart- 
ford, troopers. The man who 
tries to stop Hartford better 
begin with me.” Felix opened 
his helmet, removed it, and 
placed it on the rocks beside 
him. He went up to drink from 
the fountain that sparkled 
about the head of the Daibut- 



su, cupping his hands. “It’s 
good water, men,” he said. 
“Come on down, Hartford,” he 
shouted through the clear 
night air. 

L EE Hartford twisted over 
the edge of the shelf, held 
himself by his finger-tips, and 
dropped. He stood before his 
old comrades in arms dressed 
as a country Kansan. His head 
bore only a stubble of hair, 
and a scarlet blabrigar came 
down to settle familiarly on 
his shoulder. “I caused your 
suits to be breached for good 
reason,” he said, speaking into 
the bitcher he'd recovered 
from his safety-suit. “If any 
of you has a sore backside be- 
cause of the darts my men 
sent at you, please accept my 
a p o 1 o g i e s.” Two more 
Axenites removed their hel- 
mets, and stood grinning un- 
certainly at Hartford. “I have 
lived on Kansas for two 
weeks, living like a native. 
I've breathed Kansan air, eat- 
en their wonderful food and 
even kissed one of their girls.” 
There was a murmur of laugh- 
ter. “I’m as healthy as ever I 
was inside the Barracks,” 
Hartford said. “And I'm a 
good deal happier.” 

There was louder laughter 
among the Axenites, and more 
helmets opened. Hartford 
turned to look behind him. 
Takeko was hanging by her 
fingertips off the shelf, try- 
ing to work up the courage to 
drop. He went over to stand 
below her. “Fall to me, dar- 



THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS 



87 




ling/' he said. ‘'Fall into my 
arms.*' 

“I hear, shujin , and obey,” 
Takeko squeaked, and 
dropped. 

When Hartford released 
Takeko and turned to face the 
troopers, every helmet but 
Nef’s was opened. Half a 
dozen of the men had already 
stripped to their Class B’s. 
They had their faces tilted 
into the wind that was sweep- 
ing up the gullet of the can- 
yon, smelling for the first 
time in their lives the scents 
of open nature, the spice of 
green life in the air. They 
were seeing the Kansas sky; 
a mosaic of stars, unfiltered 
by he 'me ts. They were breath- 
ing air not humid with their 
own perspiration. Holding Ta- 
keko’s hand in his, Hartford 
walked up to Felix. "You 
saved the day, old buddy,” he 
said. 

There was the cough of a 
tapoed-off Dardick-round. 

Felix fell. Colonel Nef, his 
pistol held at the hip, tilted 
it toward Hartford. He looked 
startled for a moment, then 
dropped the pistol. In his 
wrist were three blowgun- 
darts. Mustered across his 
chest were half a dozen more. 
Hartford waved at the Kan- 
sans on the ledge. “ Arigato!” 
he shouted, and told them to 
come down. 

Two men had died in the 
engagement : Yoritomo the pa- 
permaker and Sannosvke the 
carpenter’s son. Felix’s thigh- 
bone had been broken by Nef’s 



shot; and Colonel Nef’s right 
wrist would require attention. 
A medical officer had been 
sent for from the Barracks to 
set Felix’s leg. The dead men 
were carried on litters up to 
the shelves and around the 
fallen Daibutsu to the village. 
Hartford splinted his friend’s 
broken leg. "What now, Hart- 
ford?” Felix asked. 

"I suggest that you all be- 
come guests in Yamamura.” 
"Done and done,” Felix said. 
Takeko came up to lay a 
bunch of flowers on his chest. 
"They smell sweet,” she said. 
"Courage such as yours smells 
sweet in the nostrils of heav- 
en.” 

"Thank you, Ma’am,” Felix 
said. He turned his head to 
follow the girl as she took a 
second handful of flowers to 
place it beside the fountain 
that jetted about the head- 
standing Daibutsu. "I can see 
where this will be a popular 
planet to do duty on, Lieu- 
tenant,” he said. "What you 
discovered here will pretty 
well wipe out the Brother- 
hood.” 1 

"You’re right,” Hartford 
said. "The Brotherhood is 
doomed.” 

They watched as Takeko 
knelt before the inverted 
image. “Namu. Amida Butsu ,” 
she said. "All men are the 
same in the sight of Amida, 
the Lord of Boundless Light.” 
"Maybe I’m wrong, Lieuten- 
ant,” Felix said. "Maybe the 
Brotherhood just got start- 
ed.” end

UNCLE SAM’S 
TIME MACHINE 

BY THEODORE STURGEON 



I N the great gray Groff 
Conklin’s introduction to 
my Funk & Wagnalls collec- 
tion A Way Home , he men- 
tions my “beautiful black- 
banged wife.” This remark- 
able lady, while operating a 
meticulous household and 
beautifully raising four kids, 
two fish and a dog, writes 
haiku, does Japanese calli- 
graphy and, having trimmed 
and suppled herself at ballet, 
paints in oils. Needing there- 
fore some spare time activity, 
she became a den mother, and 
every week, for an hour, my 
placid studio becomes a ca- 
cophonous cave and we are all 
up to here in Cub Scouts. 

Now a Cub Scout den in a 
spread-out community like 
ours calls for a surprising de- 



gree of synchronized logis- 
tics. (Anybody who forgets 
the refreshments will never do 
it again.) The boys arrive 
from different directions and 
different schools and are 
picked up by volunteer dis- 
taff-type chauffeurs with wor- 
ries of their own ; so above all, 
there has to be timing. 

It happened one day recent- 
ly that at some point during 
the rituals, the clock stopped. 
The only Cub with a wrist- 
watch that was running had 
both of its hands off and skat- 
ing around under the crystal. 
There came a great wail of 
temporal disorientation, to 
which I responded by invad- 
ing the sanctum, switching on 
my all-wave radio, tuning it 
to 2.5 megacycles and flood- 



89 





in g the room with a pure con- 
cert A, which was punctuated 
by a series of sharp clicks at 
one-second intervals. An awed 
and attentive silence fell, and 
in a moment a man’s voice re- 
marked : “National Bureau of 
Standards, WWV. When the 
tone returns, the time will be 
...five five P.M., Eastern 
Standard Time.” The tone re- 
turned and the voice said, 
“Five five P.M.” The clock 
was set, order restored, and 
we returned, they to their B-P 
inspirationals, I to my baby- 
sitting. 

Aside from a warm feeling 
of having saved the day, I did 
not realize that I had made a 
major magic until the phone 
began to ring that evening, 
and one after another of the 
participants and/or their par- 
ents began calling to find out 
just what was that radio sta- 
tion I had evoked. Well, 
WWV and I have been 
friends and associates for at 
least 15 years now, and I was 
happy to say so. I thought I 
knew a good deal about its 
many functions and uses, and 
it occurred to me that you 
might like to know something 
about it too. So I wrote to the 
station and asked for some ma- 
terial. 

PROMPTLY and with the 
^greatest courtesy, they sent 
it Brother! It was like the 
discovery after expert years 
of pulling pigtails that there’s 
much more you can do with 
girls. I’m now a good deal 

90 



more astonished and im- 
pressed by WWV than are the 
Scouts of Den 2, Pack 34. 

As you may know, I jangle 
a bit of guitar, and it’s nice to 
have a readily available con- 
cert A for tuning up the 
gourd. Since WWV is on the 
air 24 hours a day, it doesn’t 
matter how late the party gets. 
It’s also nice to be able to find 
out what time it is without 
having to listen to the yowl- 
ing of some catamount backed 
up by a piano imitating a 
loose skid-chain, followed by 
two commercials. I was aware 
as well that WWV broadcasts 
on a number of different fre- 
quencies and is kept very ac- 
curately on them, so that if 
you like to have your tuning 
dial telling the truth, you can 
calibrate it against WWV’s 
signal. Or say someone wants 
to sell you a three or four- 
band receiver, and you want 
to know if the tuning is ac- 
curate on all of them, and not 
one or two only; WWV will 
tell you about that right now 
and with no argument. 

I knew also, or could de- 
duce, that WWV provided a 
standard for manufacturers of 
clocks and watches, of musi- 
cal instruments, of electronic 
components like signal gener- 
ators and vacuum tube volt- 
meters and the like, as well as 
radio receivers. And of course 
radio hams and Signal Corps- 
men and ship-to-shore tele- 
phone maintenance personnel 
would find a use for such a 
standard. And symphony or- 

by Theodore Sturgeon 




chestras. And radio-TV net- 
works, who must synchronize 
their equipment across three, 
or five, or eight time zones. 
And Western Union's radio- 
relay systems. And ships and 
planes, whose navigators tak- 
ing star or sun-shots must 
have accurate time measure- 
ment in order to calculate 
their positions. The more you 
think of it, the more uses you 
can dream up for such a serv- 
ice, and a lot of them are 
above and beyond mere con- 
venience. 

When I began wondering 
about WWV, and while I was 
waiting for their reply to my 
query (which wasn’t long: 
they were as prompt as they 
were helpful) I began listen- 
ing a little more attentively 
to it. I noticed that part of the 
time they broadcast another, 
higher note than the A-440, 
that sometimes they kept the 
one-second tick but dropped 
the audio tone altogether, that 
occasionally the tick would 
be tick-tick instead, that at the 
time of the voice announce- 
ment the audio tone would do 
a dit-dah bit in Morse code, 
that once in a while there 
would be a minute or so of a 
sound like a faulty electric 
shaver (my five-year-old says 
it sounds like jingle-bells, and 
in a way she’s right) and that 
every now and then the whole 
shebang goes off the air for a 
few minutes. 

Then came the mailing from 
WWV, and I’m going to have 
a heck of a job boiling it down 



into the available space. How 
so very much can be packed 
into a radio program consist- 
ing of some toots and a tick 
simply stretches belief. In a 
way it reminds me of a re- 
markable biologist called Noel 
Monkman, who once organ- 
ized an expedition to investi- 
gate the crater of an extinct 
volcano, traveled and climbed 
for days to get there, had him- 
self lowered a hundred-odd 
feet down into the hole and 
found nothing there but scum- 
my water. He yelled up for 
his companions to dump out 
and wash a thermos flash and 
lower it to him. He filled it 
and corked it, and with less 
than a pint of smelly liquid to 
show for his trouble, he wrote 
a book and made a full-length 
movie from his observations of 
it. To me, WWV’s toot and 
tick offer just that sort of 
marvelous microcosm. 

The best way to get an over- 
all idea of how much informa- 
tion is packed into this slen- 
der hiccuping thread of sound 
is to see what they started 
with and what they added to 
it. As you read, pay special at- 
tention to the remarks on ac- 
curacy, because they build up 
to one of the darnedest dead- 
pan punchlines I have yet en- 
countered. 

I N March 1923, the National 
Bureau of Standards began 
transmitting, for use by the 
public, radio signals of defi- 
nite announced frequency, to 
help with the standardization 



UNCLE SAM S TIME MACHINE 



91 




of meters and radio gear. The 
station : WWV. The place : 
Washington, D.C. The signals 
were accurate in frequency to 
about 5 parts in 100,000, and 
were transmitted for a while 
each month in the range 125 
to 7200 kc. 

In January 1931 a new 
transmitter was set up at Col- 
lege Park, Md., and an extend- 
ed service was begun, featur- 
ing a crystal-controlled broad- 
cast on 5000 kc which was ac- 
curate to 3 parts in a million. 

The move to Beltsville, 
Md., came in 1932, and there 
WWV lives and works to this 
day. The new transmitter had 
accuracy of one part in 
5,000,000. In 1933 a high-power 
transmitter was installed, and 
in 1934 they added frequencies 
of 10 and 15 megacycles. In 
1935 a modulation frequency 
of one kc was added, and in 
1937 they began broadcasting 
the standard musical pitch, 
A/440, which they sent out on 
5 megacycles. In July ’38 came 
the ticks, or seconds-pulses. 
In 1939 the station went on a 
24-hour schedule, and accu- 
racy was increased to one part 
in 10 million. Upon which the 
whole thing burned down. 

That was on November 6, 
1940. Five days later WWV 
was back on the air, with re- 
duced service, but anyway, 
back on the air, with one kilo- 
watt of power on 5000 kc. By 
March 1941 the “ticks” and 
the musical A/440 were back, 
and in December of the same 
year the 15,000 kilocycle car- 



rier was restored at one kilo- 
watt. 

The station was moved to a 
new site in Beltsville in 1943, 
with high power operation on 
5, 10 and 15 me. On January 9, 
1946, after inclusion of broad- 
casts on 2.5, 20, and 25 me, ra- 
dio propagation disturbance 
warning notices were added. 
And now we can pause and 
look at what they had 
achieved, because it was at 
this point that they served the 
public with the six main func- 
tions which they carry out to 
this day. 

First of all, there were the 
six broadcast frequency stand- 
ards mentioned above; when 
you calibrated your equip- 
ment to these, you knew you 
were right. Then there was the 
time, and the time intervals; 
you could count on there be- 
ing just about exactly one sec- 
ond between those ticks. Then 
there was the concert A. This 
was 440 cycles per second and 
not 439-point-any-number-of- 
nines. They were also sending 
(I forgot to mention) a 4000- 
cycle audio note, for an inter- 
mediate frequency check. 
They were actually announc- 
ing the time in Morse, as well 
as marking it, and finally, 
there were these radio propa- 
gation notices. 

Here’s the way these work. 
The Bureau of Standards has 
a propagation laboratory at 
Ft. Belvoir, Va., and prepares 
short-term forecasts on the 
broadcasting conditions cur- 
rently existing on North At- 



92 



by Theodore Sturgeon 




lantic radio paths, such as 
Washington to London or 
New York to Berlin. These 
forecasts are based on infor- 
mation secured from a world- 
wide network of geophysical 
and solar observations, balloon 
soundings, reports on short- 
wave reception and the like, 
and are issued four times a 
day. WWV, using the audio 
tone they happen to be broad- 
casting at the time, gives this 
material in Morse code. It is 
scheduled for 19.5 and 49.5 
minutes past each hour; that 
is to say, the forecasts are 
corrected four times a day and 
sent out twice each hour. The 
code takes the form of a let- 
ter and a digit. “W” means 
“disturbed” and is used with 
numbers 1 to 4, which signi- 
fy degrees of mush from 
“useless” to “poor-to-fair”. 
“U” is “unsettled” and is used 
with the numeral 5. “N” means 
“normal” and is followed by 
numerals 6 to 9, signifying 
conditions varying from fair- 
to-good all the way up to ex- 
cellent. This kind of informa- 
tion, of course, is vital for ra- 
dio-telephony, s h o r t-wave 
links and all such traffic, and 
enables overseas operators to 
decide when to hold and when 
to send transmissions. And in 
this letter-and-number system 
is even more information; for 
if conditions are expected to 
worsen, the number won't be- 
long to the letter; that is, 
“N4” means “It's okay now 
but it’s going to get foggy 
pretty quick.” And “U-8” 

UNCLE SAM’S TIME MACHINE 



would mean “Not so hot just 
now, but it’s clearing up.” 

S O back to our history. In 
November 1948 the Pacific 
began to get the same kind of 
service via the sister station 
WWVH at Maui in Hawaii. 
And in January 1950, the 4000- 
cycle audio note was discon- 
tinued and a 600-cycle note 
substituted to alternate with 
the A/440. Why 600? So that 
power-plants half around the 
world could have a really ac- 
curate check of the 60-cycle 
alternation of their output — 
that good old 60 cycles that 
drives your four-dollar elec- 
tric clock and keeps it to an 
accuracy almost undreamed of 
in the days of springs and 
pendulums and balance- 
wheels. 600 cycles is a useful 
middle-frequency note in it- 
self, and it’s a multiple of 
your house-current. 

During 1956 (you’ve been 
watching this?) the broadcasts 
were refined from one part in 
50 million to one part in 100 
million. In addition, the sta- 
bility of the frequencies 
broadcast was increased to 
about (that “about” is straight 
from the material BuStand- 
ards sent me) one part in a 
billion at WWV and to 5 
parts in a billion at WWVH. 

Also in 1956 a change was 
made in the manner of send- 
ing tones. The audio was re- 
duced from four to three min- 
utes of each five, and in addi- 
tion a silent period was intro- 
duced : the WWV carriers are 



93 




removed from the air altogeth- 
er for four minutes, beginning 
at 45 minutes, 15 seconds after 
each hour. I haven’t been able 
to ascertain just why, but it’s 
easy to imagine certain elec- 
tronic watch-dog or control 
equipment which might be 
precisely turned off and on or 
modulated by the removal and 
return of these signals. 

The way the time announce- 
ments are made, and their ana- 
tomy, are particularly fasci- 
nating. The first thing you 
notice about a WWV signal is 
the tick — tick—oi the seconds 
pulse. Listen very carefully 
and you’ll notice that the last 
second of each minute has no 
tick; it’s omitted. The first 
second of the next minute is 
marked by two ticks a tenth 
of a second apart; the first of 
these marks the beginning of 
the second. And in a moment 
you’ll notice that the tone is 
not, as it first seemed, contin- 
uous, with the “tick” over- 
laying it. The tone actually 
stops to admit the tick, or 
pulse, for all of one one-hun- 
dredth of a second. And the 
tick isn’t a tick at all! It’s a 
tiny piece of a 1000-cycle note, 
to be exact, five cycles. This 
takes (natch) five thou- 
sandths of a second. Then 
there’s a Jong pause of two 
and a half hundredths of a 
second, and the audio tone re- 
sumes. If you think that’s a 
lot to be going on within a 
tick of time, stick around: 
there’s lots more that can be 
packed in. 

94 



As quoted in the Cub Scout 
anecdote, the voice announce- 
ment is made twice during the 
last ten seconds of each five- 
minute period. You will also 
hear the audio tone perform- 
ing some Morse. This is also 
the time, but while the voice 
gives Eastern Standard time, 
the Morse gives Universal 
Time (UT) the reference of 
which is the zero meridian. 
This affords scientists and 
technologists and saucer- 
watchers a chance to make 
simultaneous measurements 
thousands of miles apart with- 
out calculating time zones. 

A ND now we come to the 
International Geophysical 
Year, and a chance to shovel 
some more information into 
the tick and the toot. The IGY 
began in 1957, and something 
called International World 
Day Service was instituted. 
This IWDS notifies all inter- 
ested parties that some signif- 
icant geophysical event is 
taking place — a big magnetic 
storm, an outstanding auroral 
display, or a significant in- 
crease in cosmic ray activity. 
The alert is broadcast first by 
WWV at 1604.5 UT, and by 
WWVH at 1714.4 UT. (How’d 
you like to arrange to meet 
your girl at seventeen-four- 
teen and four tenths?) The 
code for an alert, in slow 
Morse, is AGI AAAA. Now, if 
the event turns out to be of 
really great importance, so 
that observers and experi- 
menters should really get to 

by Theodore Sturgeon 




work on it, a Special World 
Interval is declared. The code 
for this is AGI followed by 
three extra-long dashes. 

And now we come to 1961, 
when WWV seems to have 
sworn off all the crude stuff 
and decided to really hone it 
fine. First of all they brought 
the stability to one part in 10 10 , 
which was called one part in 
ten billion when you were a 
kid. Then they retarded (as of 
Jan. 1, 1961) the whole sched- 
ule by 5 microseconds, to 
bring it into line with other 
standardized frequency broad- 
casting stations throughout 
the world. Then, without 
dropping anything, they 
grafted on a time signal 
which will, if you like, and if 
you know how to grab it, in- 
form you what second of what 
minute of what hour of what 
day of the year you are listen- 
ing to. It will do this six hun- 
dred times every hour. And 
this is the “jingle bells” my 
youngster mentioned. It oc- 
curs for a solid minute im- 
mediately following the cessa- 
tion of the audio tone, ten 
times during the hour. The in- 
formation is in a binary code, 
and transmits 36 “bits” within 
100 pulses within 1 second. In 
binary numbers, which you 
will recall are all l’s and 0’s, 
it gives first the number of 
the second, then what minute 
we’re in, then the number of 
the hour (UT), then the num- 
ber (total) of the day since 
the year began. The transmis- 

UNCLE SAM’S TIME MACHINE 



sion also contains the binary 
technicalities of 10-per-second 
index markers and a one-per- 
second reference marker. The 
whole message is made of thin 
slices of a 100-cycle tone. The 

0 pulse is 2 cycles of the tone, 
and the 1 pulse is 6 cycles of 
the tone. This affords 36 bits 
in a second, and, take my word 
for it as I take BuStandard’s, 
there are four bits left over. 
They are trying to figure out 
what to do with these. Maybe 
they’ll add the number of the 
year (like 62) or perhaps the 
station identification. Or may- 
be some micromadison-avenue 
minibrain will figure out how 
to make a millibuck selling it 
as commercial spots. 

And now we come to Bu- 
Standard’s one-word punch- 
line — the end of one of the re- 
ports they sent me about 
WWV (which started in 1923 
establishing frequency stand- 
ards accurate to about 5 parts 
in 100,000, and now stabilize 
to one part in ten billion) : 

“Development work is un- 
derway to increase (1) the ef- 
fectiveness of the seconds 
pulse, (2) power in the time 
pulses, (3) area served by 
standard frequency broad- 
casts and (4) accuracy.” END

IF • Short Story 



It was dirty work, but it would make him a man. 
And kids had a right to grow up — some of them! 

THE RECRUIT 

BY BRYCE WALTON 

ILLUSTRATED BY SCHELING 



W AYNE, unseen, sneered 
down from the head of 
the stairs. 

The old man with his thick 
neck, thick cigar, evening 
highball, potgut and bald head 
without a brain in it. His slim 
mother with nervously polite 
smiles and voice fluttering, 
assuring the old man by her 
frailty that he was big in the 
world. They were squareheads 
one and all, marking moron 
time in a gray dream. Man, 
was he glad to break out. 

The old man said, “He’ll be 
okay. Let him alone.” 

“But he won’t eat. Just lies 
there all the time.” 

“Hell,” the old man said. 
“Sixteen’s a bad time. School 
over, waiting for the draft 
and all. He’s in between. It’s 



rough.” 

Mother clasped her fore- 
arms and shook her head once 
slowly. 

“We got to let him go, Eva. 
It’s a dangerous time. You 
got to remember about all 
these dangerous repressed im- 
pulses piling up with nowhere 
to go, like they say. You read 
the books.” 

“But he’s unhappy.” 

“Are we specialists? That’s 
the Youth Board’s headache, 
ain’t it? What do we know 
about adolescent trauma and 
like that? Now get dressed or 
we’ll be late.” 

Wayne watched the ritual, 
grinning. He listened to their 
purposeless noises, their blab- 
bing and yakking as if they 
had something to say. Blab- 



96 




blab about the same old bones, 
and end up chewing them in 
the same old ways. Then they 
begin all over again. A freak 
sideshow all the way to no- 
where. Squareheads going 
around either unconscious or 
with eyes looking dead from 
the millennium in the office 
waiting to retire into limbo. 

How come he’d been stuck 
with parental images like 
that? One thing — when he was 
jockeying a rocket to Mars or 
maybe firing the pants off 
Asiatic reds in some steamy 
gone jungle paradise, he’d for- 
get his punkie origins in tee- 
veeland. 

But the old man was right 
on for once about the danger- 
ous repressed impulses. 
Wayne had heard about it 
often enough. Anyway there 
was no doubt about it when 
every move he made was a 
restrained explosion. So he’d 
waited in his room, and it 
wasn’t easy sweating it out 
alone waiting for the break- 
out call from HQ. 

“Well, dear, if you say so,” 
Mother said, with the old re- 
signed sigh that must make 
the old man feel like Super- 
man with a beerbelly. 

They heard Wayne slouch- 
ing loosely down the stairs 
and looked up. 

^ “Relax,” Wayne said. 
“You’re not going anywhere 
tonight.” 

“What, son?” his old man 
said uneasily. “Sure we are. 
We’re going to the movies.” 

He could feel them watch- 

THE RECRUIT 



ing him, waiting; and yet still 
he didn’t answer. Somewhere 
out in suburban grayness a 
dog barked, then was silent. 

“Okay, go,” Wayne said. 
“If you wanta walk. I’m tak- 
ing the family boltbucket.” 
“But we promised the Clem- 
ons, dear,” his mother said. 

“Hell,” Wayne said, grin- 
ning straight into the old man. 
“I just got my draft call.” 

He saw the old man’s 
Adam’s apple move. “Oh, my 
dear boy,” Mother cried out. 

“So gimme the keys,” 
Wayne said. The old man 
handed the keys over. His un- 
derstanding smile was 
strained, and fear flicked in 
his sagging eyes. 

“Do be careful, dear,” his 
mother said. She ran toward 
him as he laughed and shut 
the door on her. He was still 
laughing as he whoomed the 
Olds between the pale dead 
glow of houses and roared up 
the ramp onto the Freeway. 
Ahead was the promising glit- 
ter of adventure-calling neon, 
and he looked up at the high 
skies of night and his eyes 
sailed the glaring wonders of 
escape. 

H E burned off some rubber 
finding a slot in the park- 
lot. He strode under a sign 
reading Public Youth Center 
No. 947 and walked casually to 
the reception desk, where a 
thin man with sergeant’s 
stripes and a pansy haircut 
looked out of a pile of paper- 
work. 



97 




“Where you think you’re 
going, my pretty lad?” 

Wayne grinned down. 
“Higher I hope than a type- 
writer jockey.” 

“Well,” the sergeant said. 
“How tough we are this eve- 
ning. You have a pass, killer?” 
“Wayne Seton. Draft call.” 
“Oh.” The sergeant checked 
his name off a roster and nod- 
ded. He wrote on a slip of pa- 
per, handed the pass to 
Wayne. “Go to the Armory 
and check out whatever your 
lusting little heart desires. 
Then report to Captain Jack, 
room 307.” 

“Thanks, s a r g e dear,” 
Wayne said and took the ele- 
vator up to the Armory. 

A tired fat corporal with a 
naked head blinked up at tall 
Wayne. Finally he said, “So 
make up your mind, bud. 
Think you’re the only kid 
breaking out tonight?” 

“Hold your teeth, pop,” 
Wayne said, coolly and slowly 
lighting a cigarette. “I’ve de- 
cided.” 

The corporal’s little eyes 
studied Wayne with malicious 
amusement. “Take it from a 
vet, bud. Sooner you go the 
better. It’s a big city and 
you’re starting late. You can 
get a cat, not a mouse, and 
some babes are clever hell- 
cats in a dark alley.” 

“You must be a genius,” 
Wayne said. “A corporal with 
no hair and still a counterboy. 
I’m impressed. I’m all ears, 
Dad.” 

The corporal sighed wear- 

98 



ily. “You can get that bal- 
loon head ventilated, bud, and 
good.” 

Wayne’s mouth twitched. 
He leaned across the counter 
toward the shelves and racks 
of weapons. “I’ll remember 
that crack when I get my com- 
mission.” He blew smoke in 
the corporal’s face. “Bring me 
a Smith and Wesson .38, 
shoulder holster with spring- 
clip. And throw in a Skelly 
switchblade for kicks — the 
six-inch disguised job with 
the double springs.” 

The corporal waddled back 
with the revolver and the 
switchblade disguised in a 
leather comb case. He checked 
them on a receipt ledger, while 
Wayne examined the weap- 
ons, broke open the revolver, 
twirled the cylinder and 
pushed cartridges into the 
waiting chamber. He slipped 
the knife from the comb case, 
flicked open the blade and 
stared at its gleam in the but- 
tery light as his mouth went 
dry and the refracted incan- 
descence of it trickled on his 
brain like melted ice, exciting 
and scary. 

He removed his leather 
jacket. He slung the holster 
under his left armpit and test- 
ed the spring clip release sev- 
eral times, feeling the way the 
serrated butt dropped into his 
wet palm. He put his jacket 
back on and the switchblade 
case in his pocket. He walked 
toward the elevator and didn’t 
look back as the corporal said, 
by Bryce Walton 




“Good luck, tiger." 

Captain Jack moved mas- 
sively. The big stone-walled 
office, alive with stuffed 
lion and tiger and gunracks, 
seemed to grow smaller. 
Captain Jack crossed black- 
booted legs and whacked a 
cane at the floor. It had a 
head shaped like a grinning 
bear. 

Wayne felt the assured 
smile die on his face. Some- 
thing seemed to shrink him. 
If he didn’t watch himself 
he’d begin feeling like a pea 
among bowling balls. 

Contemptuously amused lit- 
tle eyes glittered at Wayne 
from a shaggy head. Shoul- 
ders hunched like stuffed sea- 
bags. 

“Wayne Seton,” said Cap- 
tain Jack as if he were dis- 
cussing something in a bug 
collection. “Well, well, you’re 
really fired up aren’t you? 
Really going out to eat ’em. 
Right, punk?” 

“Yes, sir,” Wayne said. 
He ran wet hands down the 
sides of his chinos. His legs 
seemed sheathed in lead as he 
bit inwardly at shrinking fear 
the way a dog snaps at a 
wound. You big overblown 
son, he thought, I’ll show 
you but good who is a punk. 
They made a guy wait and 
sweat until he screamed. They 
kept a guy on the fire until 
desire leaped in him, ran and 
billowed and roared until his 
brain was filled with it. But 
that wasn’t enough. If this 
THE RECRUIT 



muscle-bound creep was such 
a big boy, what was he doing 
holding down a desk? 

“Well, this is it, punk. You 
go the distance or start a but- 
terfly collection.” 

The cane darted up. A blade 
snicked from the end and 
stopped an inch from Wayne’s 
nose. He jerked up a shaky 
hand involuntarily and 
clamped a knuckle-ridged gag 
to his gasping mouth. 

Captain Jack chuckled. “All 
right, superboy.” He handed 
Wayne his passcard. “Cur- 
few’s off, punk, for 6 hours. 
You got 6 hours to make out.” 
“Yes, sir.” 

“Your beast is primed and 
waiting at the Four Aces 
Club on the West Side. Know 
where that is, punk?” 

“No, sir, but I’ll find it 
fast.” 

“Sure you will, punk,” 
smiled Captain Jack. “She’ll 
be wearing yellow slacks and 
a red shirt. Black hair, a cute 
trick. She’s with a hefty psy- 
cho who eats punks for break- 
fast. He’s butchered five peo- 
ple. They’re both on top of 
the Undesirable list, Seton. 
They got to go and they’re 
your key to the stars.” 

“Yes, sir,” Wayne said. 

“So run along and make out, 
punk,” grinned Captain Jack. 

A copcar stopped Wayne as 
he started over the bridge, 
out of bright respectable neon 
into the murky westside slum 
over the river. 



99 




Wayne waved the pass card, 
signed by Captain Jack, under 
the cop’s quivering nose. The 
cop shivered and stepped back 
and waved him on. The Olds 
roared over the bridge as the 
night’s rain blew away. 

The air through the open 
window was chill and damp 
coming from Slumville, but 
Wayne felt a cold that wasn’t 
of the night or the wind. He 
turned off into a rat’s warren 
of the inferiors. Lights turned 
pale, secretive and sparse, the 
uncared-for streets became 
rough with pitted potholes, 
narrow and winding and hu- 
mid with wet unpleasant 
smells. Wayne’s fearful exhil- 
aration increased as he 
cruised with bated breath 
through the dark mazes of 
streets and rickety tenements 
crawling with the shadows of 
mysterious promise. 

He found the alley, dark, a 
gloom-dripping tunnel. He 
drove cautiously into it and 
rolled along, watching. His 
belly ached with expectancy 
as he spotted the sick-looking 
dab of neon wanly sparkling. 

FOUR ACES CLUB 

He parked across the al- 
ley. He got out and stood in 
shadows, digging the sultry 
beat of a combo, the wild 
pulse of drums and spinning 
brass filtering through win- 
dows painted black. 

He breathed deep, started 
over, ducked back. A stewbum 
weaved out of a bank of gar- 
bage cans, humming to him- 
100 



self, pulling at a rainsoaked 
shirt clinging to a pale stick 
body. He reminded Wayne of 
a slim grub balanced on one 
end. 

The stewbum stumbled. His 
bearded face in dim breaking 
moonlight had a dirty, green- 
ish tinge as he sensed Wayne 
there. He turned in a gro- 
tesque uncoordinated jiggling 
and his eyes were wide with 
terror and doom. 

“I gotta hide, kid. They’re 
on me.” 

Wayne’s chest rose and his 
hands curled. 

The bum’s fingers drew at 
the air like white talons. 

“Help me, kid.” 

He turned with a scratchy 
cry and retreated before the 
sudden blast of headlights 
from a Cad bulleting into the 
alley. The Cad rushed past 
Wayne and he felt the engine- 
hot fumes against his legs. 
Tires squealed. The Cad 
stopped and a teener in black 
jacket jumped out and 
crouched as he began stalking 
the old rummy. 

“This is him! This is him 
all right,” the teener yelled, 
and one hand came up swing- 
ing a baseball bat. 

A head bobbed out of the 
Cad window and giggled. 

The fumble-footed rummy 
tried to run and plopped on 
wet pavement. The teener 
moved in, while a faint odor 
of burnt rubber hovered in 
the air as the Cad cruised in 
a slow follow-up. 

Wayne*s breath quickened 
by Bryce Walton 




as he watched, feeling some- 
how blank wonder at finding 
himself there, free and break- 
ing out at last with no cur- 
few and no law but his own. 
He felt as though he couldn’t 
stop anything. Living seemed 
directionless, but he still 
would go with it regardless, 
until something dropped off 
or blew to hell like a hot light- 
bulb. He held his breath, wait- 
ing. His body was tensed and 
rigid as he moved in spirit 
with the hunting teener, an 
omniscient shadow with a 
hunting license and a ghetto 
jungle twenty miles deep. 

The crawling stewbum 
screamed as the baseball bat 
whacked. The teener laughed. 
Wayne wanted to shout. He 
opened his mouth, but the yell 
clogged up somewhere, so 
that he remained soundless 
yet with his mouth still open 
as he heard the payoff thuds 
where the useless wino curled 
up with stick arms over his 
rheumy face. 

The teener laughed, tossed 
the bat away and began jump- 
ing up and down with his 
hobnailed, mail-order air force 
boots. Then he ran into the 
Cad. A hootch bottle soared 
out, made a brittle tink-tink 
of falling glass. 

“Go, man!” 

The Cad wooshed by. It 
made a sort of hollow suck- 
ing noise as it bounced over 
the old man twice. Then the 
finlights diminished like 
bright wind-blown sparks. 

Wayne walked over and 
THE RECRUIT 



sneered down at the human 
garbage lying in scummed 
rain pools. The smell of raw 
violence, the scent of blood, 
made his heart thump like a 
trapped rubber ball in a cage. 

He hurried into the Four 
Aces, drawn by an exhilarat- 
ing vision. .and pursued by 
the hollow haunting fears of 
his own desires. 

H E walked through the 
wavering haze of smoke 
and liquored dizziness and 
stood until his eyes learned 
the dark. He spotted her red 
shirt and yellow legs over in 
the corner above a murky 
lighted table. 

He walked toward her, 
watching her little subhuman 
pixie face lift. The eyes wid- 
ened with exciting terror, 
turned even paler behind a red 
slash of sensuous mouth. 
Briefed and waiting, primed 
and eager for running, she 
recognized her pursuer at 
once. He sat at a table near 
her, watching and grinning 
and seeing her squirm. 

She sat in that slightly 
baffled, fearful and uncom- 
prehending attitude of being 
motionless, as though they 
were all actors performing in 
a weirdo drama being staged 
in that smoky thick-aired 
dive. 

Wayne smiled with wry 
superiority at the redheaded 
psycho in a dirty T-shirt, a 
big bruiser with a gorilla face. 
He was tussling his mouse 
heavy.

"What’s yours, teener?” the 
slug-faced waiter asked. 

"Bring me a Crusher, bud- 
dyroo,” Wayne said, and 
flashed his pass card. 

"Sure, teener.” 

Red nuzzled the mouse’s 
neck and made drooly noises. 
Wayne watched and fed on 
the promising terror and help- 
lessness of her hunted face. 
She sat rigid, eyes fixed on 
Wayne like balls of frozen 
glass. 

Red looked up and stared 
straight at Wayne with eyes 
like black buttons imbedded in 
the waxlike skin of his face. 
Then he grinned all on one 
side. One huge hand scratched 
across the wet table top like 
a furious cat’s. 

Wayne returned the chal- 
lenging move but felt a nerv- 
ous twitch jerk at his lips. 
A numbness covered his brain 
like a film as he concentrated 
on staring down Red the psy- 
cho. But Red kept looking, 
his eyes bright but dead. Then 
he began struggling it up 
again with the scared little 
mouse. 

The waiter sat the Crusher 
down. Wayne signed a chit; 
tonight he was in the pay of 
the state. 

“What else, teener?” 

"One thing. Fade.” 

"Sure, teener,” the waiter 
said, his breathy words drip- 
ping like syrup. 

Wayne drank. Liquored 
heat dripped into his stomach. 
Fire tickled his veins, became 
hot wire twisting in his head. 

102 



He drank again and forced out 
a shaky breath. The jazz beat 
thumped fast and muted brass 
moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing 
trumpet raped the air. Tension 
mounted as Wayne watched 
her pale throat convulsing, 
the white eyelids fluttering. 
Red fingered at her legs and 
salivated at her throat, glanc- 
ing now and then at Wayne, 
baiting him good. 

"Okay, you creep,” Wayne 
said. 

He stood up and started 
through the haze. The psycho 
leaped and a table crashed. 
Wayne’s .38 dropped from its 
spring-clip holster and the 
blast filled the room. The 
psycho screamed and stumbled 
toward the door holding some- 
thing in. The mouse darted by, 
eluded Wayne’s grasp and was 
out the door. 

Wayne went out after her 
in a laughing frenzy of re- 
lease. He felt the cold strange 
breath of moist air on his 
sweating skin as he sprinted 
down the alley into a wind 
full of blowing wet. 

He ran laughing under the 
crazy starlight and glimpsed 
her now and then, fading in 
and out of shadows, jumping, 
crawling, running with the 
life-or-death animation of a 
wild deer. 

Up and down alleys, a rat’s 
maze. A rabbit run. Across 
vacant lots. Through shattered 
tenement ruins. Over a fence. 
There she was, falling, slid- 
ing down a brick shute. 

He gained. He moved up.

His labored breath pumped 
more fire. And her scream was 
a rejuvenation hypo in his 
blood. 

S HE quivered above him on 
the stoop, panting, her 
eyes afire with terror. 

“You, baby,” Wayne gasped. 
“I gotcha.” 

She backed into darkness, 
up there against the sagging 
tenement wall, her arms out 
and poised like crippled 
wings. Wayne crept up. She 
gave a squeaking sob, turned, 
ran. Wayne leaped into gloom. 
Wood cracked. He clambered 
over rotten lumber. The door- 
way sagged and he hesitated 
in the musty dark. A few feet 
away was the sound of loose 
trickling plaster, a whimper- 
ing whine. 

“No use running,” Wayne 
said. “Go loose. Give, baby. 
Give now.” 

She scurried up sagging 
stairs. Wayne laughed and dug 
up after her, feeling his way 
through debris. Dim moon- 
light filtered through a sag- 
ging stairway from a shat- 
tered skylight three floors 
up. The mouse’s shadow float- 
ed ahead. 

He started up. The entire 
stair structure canted sicken- 
ingly. A railing ripped and 
he nearly went with it back 
down to the first floor. He 
heard a scream as rotten 
boards crumbled and dust ex- 
ploded from cracks. A rat ran 
past Wayne and fell into 
space. He burst into the third- 
104 



floor hallway and saw her 
half-falling through a door 
under the jagged skylight. 

Wayne took his time. He 
knew how she felt waiting 
in there, listening to his creep- 
ing, implacable footfalls. 

Then he yelled and slammed 
open the door. 

Dust and stench, filth so 
awful it made nothing of the 
dust. In the corner he saw 
something hardly to be called 
a bed. More like a nest. A 
dirty, lumpy pile of torn mat- 
tress, felt, excelsior, shredded 
newspapers and rags. It 
seemed to crawl a little under 
the moon-streaming skylight. 

She crouched in the corner 
panting. He took his time 
moving in. He snickered as 
he flashed the switchblade 
and circled it like a serpent’s 
tongue. He watched what was 
left of her nerves go to pieces 
like rotten cloth. 

“Do it quick, hunter,” she 
whispered. “Please do it 
quick.” 

“What’s that, baby?” 

“I’m tired running. Kill me 
first. Beat me after. They 
won't know the difference.” 

“I’m gonna bruise and beat 
you,” he said. 

“Kill me first,” she begged. 
“I don’t want — ” She began 
to cry. She cried right up in 
his face, her wide eyes un- 
blinking, and her mouth open. 

“You got bad blood, baby,” 
he snarled. He laughed but it 
didn’t sound like him and 
something was wrong with 
his belly. It was knotting up. 

by Bryce Walton 




“BacL I know! So get it over 
with, please. Hurry, hurry.” 
She was small and white 
and quivering. She moaned 
but kept staring up at Jiim. 

He ripped off his rivet- 
studded belt and swung once, 
then groaned and shuffled 
away from her. 

He kept backing toward the 
door. She crawled after him, 
begging and clutching with 
both arms as she wriggled 
forward on her knees. 

“Don't run. Please. Kill me! 
It'll be someone else if you 
don't. Oh, God, I’m so tired 
waiting and running!” 

“I can't,” he said, and sick- 
ness soured in his throat. 
“Please.” 

“I can’t, I can't!” 

He turned and ran blindly, 
half-fell down the cracking 
stairs. 

D OCTOR Burns, head of 
the readjustment staff at 
the Youth Center, studied 
Wayne with abstract interest. 

“You enjoyed the hunt, Se- 
ton? You got your kicks?” 
“Yes, sir.” 

“But you couldn't execute 
them?” 

“No, sir.” 

“They're undesirables. In- 
curables. You know that, Se- 
ton?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“The psycho you only 
wounded. He's a five-times 
murderer. And that girl killed 
her father when she was 
twelve. You realize there’s 
nothing can be done for them? 
THE RECRUIT 



That they have to be execut- 
ed?” 

“I know.” 

“Too bad,” the doctor said. 
“We all have aggressive im- 
pulses, primitive needs that 
must be expressed early, 
purged. There’s murder in all 
of us, Seton. The impulse 
shouldn’t be denied or sup- 
pressed, but educated. The 
state used to kill them. Isn't 
it better all around, Seton, 
for us to do it, as part of 
growing up? What was the 
matter, Seton?” 

“I — felt sorry for her.” 

“Is that all you can say 
about it?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

The doctor pressed a buzz- 
er. Two men in white coats 
entered. 

“You should have got it out 
of your system, Seton, but 
now it’s still in there. I can't 
turn you out and have it erupt 
later — and maybe shed clean 
innocent blood, can I?” 

“No, sir,” Wayne mumbled. 
He didn’t look up. “I'm sorry 
I punked out.” 

“Give him the treatment,” 
the doctor said wearily. “And 
send him back to his mother.” 
Wayne nodded and they 
led him away. His mind 
screamed still to split open 
some prison of bone and lay 
bare and breathing wide. But 
there was no way out for the 
trapped. Now he knew about 
the old man and his poker- 
playing pals. 

They had all punked out. 
Like him, END

ALL THAT 
EARTHLY REMAINS 



BY C. C. MACAPP ILLUSTRATED BY GAUGHAIN 



B REATHING a little heavi- 
ly in the Andean air, and 
still dazed at the urgency 
with which he had been 
whisked southward (via jet 
bomber), Dr. Luis Craig 
walked across packed earth to- 
ward a powerful-looking heli- 
copter which, he had just been 
told, was to take him on the 
last leg of his trip. He lis- 
tened tiredly to the unctuous 
words of his escort, a Lieu- 
tenant Rabar who wore the 
uniform of this Latin Ameri- 
can nation’s Air Force and 
who was to fly the helicopter. 

Shouts erupted behind them, 
at the edge of the field. Some- 
thing snarled at his left ear. 
The sound was familiar, 
though not recently so : the 
crack of a rifle. He hit the 



dirt. 

Another bullet came search- 
ing, but now the shouts got 
themselves organized into 
crisp Spanish. Sidearms and 
at least two automatic weap- 
ons blatted. There were no 
more rifle shots. Cautiously, 
he raised his head to look at 
the knot of uniformed men 
where the sniper had been. 

Rabar stepped forward, of- 
fering a hand. “Are you all 
right, Doctor?” 

Craig ignored the hand and 
got up without help. “Quite, 
thank you.” He had disliked 
Rabar from the moment of in- 
troduction ; and now it was in 
his mind that Rabar had 
stepped carefully away from 
him before the first bullet 
came. 






As casually as he could, he 
walked to the aluminum lad- 
der hung upon the helicop- 
ter’s side and hauled himself 
up. He stopped in the hatch, 
dignity forgotten, startled at 
the disparity of the three men 
already in the ship. 

IRECTLY across the cab- 
in sat a gaunt scarecrow 
of a man in a black priest’s 
hassock. An oxygen mask dan- 
gled on his thin chest, sug- 
gesting a bloated crucifix. 
The long, swarthy face was 
pockmarked, dour and without 
animation at the moment, ex- 
cept for fierce black eyes that 
burned steadily into Craig’s 
own. Craig thought of a con- 
dor, perched near some nearly 
r *cady meal. He was immedi- 
ately ashamed of the thought. 

Forward of the priest sat a 
brown Indian. His face mir- 
rored dignified resignation to 
being carried in this hellish 
contraption to horrible death, 
or worse. 

Occupying the only seat on 
the hatch side was a tautly 
uniformed man who eyed 
Craig coldly. 

The priest spoke. His voice 
was deep and gently strong, 
caressing the Spanish sylla- 
bles like a great soft bell. “We 
are abject, Doctor. We had 
tried very hard... but there 
are fanatics.” 

“Eh?” said Craig. “Oh. 

Well, I am unhurt, as you can 
»» 

see. 

“For which, thanks to the 
Almighty. Our humblest apol- 

ALL THAT EARTHLY REMAINS 



ogies. You speak Spanish ex- 
ceptionally well, Doctor." 

Wondering if there were a 
question behind the compli- 
ment, Craig said, “My mother 
was Mexican.” He did not 
think it necessary to add that 
he’d grown up near the border, 
and had once spent two years 
as an exchange Professor of 
Physics at the Mexican uni- 
versity. 

The priest nodded once. “I 
see. It was thoughtful of your 
government to choose you. 
And more than kind of you to 
come. But, forgive me; the 
shooting has made me forget 
my manners. This — ” indicat- 
ing the uniformed man — “is 
General Noriega.” He laid a 
hand on the shoulder of the 
Indian. “And this one prefers 
to answer to the name Dien- 
tes.” 

Craig looked at the brown 
face with interest. Archeology 
was one of his hobbies, and in 
this part of the world... 
‘Dientes’ was Spanish for 
‘teeth,’ he mused. Abruptly, 
under his gaze, the immobile 
face split into a wide nervous 
smile revealing the source of 
the nickname. They were 
large, even and very white. 

“And I,” the priest was say- 
ing, “am called Father Bru- 
lieres. Won’t you seat your- 
self?” 

Craig tensed in surprise. 
The name Brulieres had been 
very much in the news of late. 
A priest by that name had led 
the movement which put the 
present government in power 

107 





— and was still reputedly, the 
man who actually ran it. 

Craig realized he was still 
perched awkwardly halfway 
into the cabin. Mumbling 
something, he squeezed his 
bulky mountain gear through 
the hatch and took the empty 
seat beside the priest. 

R ABAR came in, closing the 
hatch behind him, and 
went forward to the pilot’s 
seat. He glanced around at his 
passengers. 

It seemed to Craig that he 
was more interested in faces 
than in the condition of seat 
belts. Rabar worked at 
switches and buttons. Engines 
coughed, then roared. From 
overhead came the rising 
“whoosh” of the vanes. The 
craft shivered and lifted. 

They went on oxygen at 
once, and Craig, under the 
eyes of the other passengers, 
was glad to put the breather 
over at least part of his face. 
Imitating the others he pulled 
down the earflaps of his hel- 
met. It seemed to have built- 
in radio, as he could hear 
Rabar advising them to strap 
in. A moment later, clearing 
his throat, he discovered that 
his breather contained a mike. 
He was surprised at such ad- 
vanced electronics here. 

They were quickly closed in 
by mighty cliffs. Below them, 
a river tumbled wildly. Where 
it could find root-holds, fan- 
tastic greenery burgeoned, but 
it did little to disguise the 
menacing rock. The cabin’s 

108 



plastic windows gave all too 
clear a view. 

Turning from the window 
beside him, Craig found his 
eyes wandering to the insig- 
nia pinned to the priest’s has- 
sock. Of elegantly wrought 
gold, it was the same emblem 
he’d noticed on buildings, ve- 
hicles and other government 
property here. It looked like a 
set of football goalposts with 
the uprights moved in close 
together, leaving the crossbar 
extending to the sides. 

The priest caught his look 
and gave him what might be 
intended for a smile. “You 
wonder about our emblem? It 
represents the Church and 
State standing — what is the 
expression in your own lan- 
guage? — ‘four-square’ togeth- 
er.” 

“Oh.” Craig realized that 
the symbol was simply a cross 
with two posts instead of onS. 
He felt a little annoyed. His 
own government had told him 
enough to make him eager to 
come on this job, but they’d 
also warned him emphatically 
not to discuss politics or re- 
ligion. He supposed the Unit- 
ed States needed friends 
wherever they could be found, 
but a dictatorship wasn’t his 
notion of a good alternative to 
Bolshevism. 

He realized that the warn- 
ing had point. He didn’t know 
how ruthless these people 
might be, but the shooting 
back at the airfield hadn’t 
been any game of marbles. For 
that matter, the whole coun- 

by C. C. MacApp 




try, or what he’d seen of it, 
had an armed-camp air. 

He decided the thing to do 
was to concentrate on the sci- 
entific reason for his visit, 
and now was as good a time to 
start as any. He leaned toward 
Brulieres, then realized that 
wasn’t necessary. “Er — are 
you at liberty to tell me any- 
thing about the explosion?” 

Brulieres eyed him for a 
moment, and again there v/as 
the hint of a smile. “We could 
hardly be secretive with you, 
Doctor. You are the expert. 
How much were you told?” 

“Just that there’d been a 
nuclear explosion of unknown 
origin. They said there was 
something spectacular about 
it.” 

“Spectacular? Si! Your gov- 
ernment was gracious enough 
to accept our request for tech- 
nical help without demanding 
details. Security is very diffi- 
cult, as you comprehend.” 
Brulieres looked absent for a 
moment. “The explosion oc- 
curred at a spot famous in 
pre-Christian legends, which 
is why friend Dientes accom- 
panies us. He is considered 
experto ” The intense eyes 
turned upon the Indian, with 
a hint of mischief. “Not that 
he fails to be a good Christian 
as well.” 

The Indian crossed himself 
nervously. 

“The explosion,” Brulieres 
went on, “seems to have un- 
covered some very ancient 
tunnels. We wish to explore 
them, but we felt we needed a 

ALL THAT EARTHLY REMAINS 



nuclear physicist along. Es- 
pecially since there appears 
the possibility that the ex- 
plosion originated from the 
tunnels.” 

Craig heard Noriega clear 
his throat. Brulieres glanced 
at Noriega. “It has also been 
suggested,” the priest said, 
“that the uncovering of the 
tunnels is coincidental, and 
that the explosion was of for- 
eign origin.” 

Craig thought that over, 
and was annoyed. “That does 
not seem likely,” he said, a lit- 
tle stiffly. “Nobody is tossing 
live warheads around.” 

Noriega spoke for the first 
time. His voice was crisp and 
rather high. “You can perhaps 
speak for your own nation, 
Doctor Craig; but others too 
possess missiles.” 

Brulieres interposed, “You 
no doubt know, Doctor, that a 
communist putsch very nearly 
took over this country. The 
present government has been 
compelled to very strict meas- 
ures against a further attempt. 
Therefore we are not popular 
with the communist nations.” 
Craig waved a hand impa- 
tiently. “Yes, I know that, 
but. .” He realized he was be- 
ing careless. “I only wish to 
approach my investigation 
with an open mind. You say 
the tunnels were ancient? In- 
can, perhaps?” 

Brulieres shook his head 
slowly. “They were hardly ca- 
pable of anything on this 
scale. One cannot speak so 
surely of those who preceded 

109 




the Incas in this place.” 
Craig pondered, and felt 
his pulse move faster. “How 
much have you learned so 
far?” 

“What can be seen from the 
air. We will be the first to 
land, if you decide it is safe.” 

II 

T HEY rose with the can- 
yon, and its upper ram- 
parts began to display patches 
of snow. Ahead loomed solid 
whiteness. They strained up- 
ward and emerged over a 
snowfield glaring white in the 
sun, its jagged peaks casting 
crisp blue shadows. The cop- 
ter’s own shadow danced 
along beneath them like a 
crazy gnat. 

They aimed for a cluster of 
five or six peaks dominating 
everything else. D i e n t e s, 
twisting nervously in his seat, 
mumbled something about 
“puesto de los demo ni os .” 
They flew between two of the 
peaks and were in a basin 
formed by the roughly circu- 
lar cluster. 

Zero ground of the explo- 
sion was as obvious as an ugly 
dark blotch on white cloth. 
Snow had been melted away 
from an oblong area on the 
inner slope of one peak, leav- 
ing naked rock. Craig stared 
at what lay revealed. A 
plateau was carved out of the 
mountainside, so flat and so 
precisely oval that there 
wasn’t an instant’s doubt that 
it was artificial. The uphill 



wall was vertical, following 
exactly the curve of the el- 
lipse. The wall was in shadow, 
but Craig could make out the 
five black tunnel mouths, all 
of a shape and evenly spaced. 

He let out his breath in a 
grunt as he remembered that 
this was a blast area and that 
they were getting close. Hast- 
ily, he unhooded one of the in- 
struments, his fingers awk- 
ward with excitement. He 
watched the dial. No serious 
radiation yet. Rabar looked at 
him, and he nodded his head 
to indicate they could go clos- 
er. 

The radiation increased a 
little but was still mild. He 
pondered. The blast had been 
very clean, and of a low order, 
melting the snow without 
even scarring the rock. Ap- 
parently it had occurred not 
far above the surface and over 
the center of the plateau. He 
didn’t know of any existing 
warheads that fit the explo- 
sion, nor could he believe that 
either intent or coincidence 
had placed the blast so exact- 

] y- 

The copter was hovering 
now, the other passengers 
watching him silently. He met 
Rabar’s eyes, and glanced 
away, uncomfortable. If the 
priest’s eyes reminded him of 
a vulture’s, then Rabar’s made 
him think of a wolf’s. They 
had an odd yellowish tinge, 
and were at one time alert and 
devoid of expression. Craig 
couldn’t know where the man 
fit into things, but he didn’t

ring true as a simple pilot. 

Craig needed no diagrams 
drawn for him, so far as his 
own position went. In the 
first place, the opposition 
might assassinate him simply 
to embarrass the government. 
On the - other hand, if he 
seemed to stand in the way of 
Noriega’s project of making 
political capital of the explo- 
sion, and if Noriega represent- 
ed a strong faction in the gov- 
ernment, that faction might 
think it worth while to let 
something happen to him and 
blame it on the communists. 

But the hottest potato of all 
would be whatever he learned 
at the spot of the explosion. 
He could imagine all sorts of 
fabulous things. So would 
others, and some of them 
would go to considerable 
lengths to know. 

A N instrument, dangled at 
the end of a line, showed 
no bad radiation, so Craig said 
they could land. 

When he stood on the pla- 
teau the tunnel mouths 
seemed like converging black 
stares. Nevertheless he itched 
to explore. Impatiently, he 
led the unloading and stack- 
ing of his equipment. 

When that was done the 
group stood for a minute, evi- 
dently all feeling the awe 
Craig did. Dientes was first to 
break the silence, muttering 
something under his breath. 

Brulieres fixed the Indian 
with a look that was not en- 
tirely severe. “Christian pray- 

ALL THAT EARTHLY REMAINS 



ers, hi jo, if you please.” He 
turned to Craig. “What can be 
learned where we stand?” 

“I should be able to deter- 
mine the type of explosion. I 
will have to take rock sam- 
ples, and set up some appa- 
ratus.” 

“How long will that re- 
quire?” 

“Less than an hour, with 
luck.” 

Brulieres was thoughtful 
for a while. “In that case, I 
believe we shall begin recon- 
noitering the tunnels while 
you work. But first, let us 
hear from our expert in dem- 
onology.” 

Dientes squirmed guiltily in 
his mountain clothing. “I 
know only what the old tales 
say, Padre.” 

“Tell us, if you please. We 
will decide later whether you 
have been guilty of paganis - 
mo .” 

“Si, Padre. This place is the 
home of the Fire Devils. There 
is no question of the fact. It 
is precisely as described when 
I was a small boy sitting at 
the feet of los viejos .” 

“Well, then. What manner 
of devils were they?” 

“Creatures of fire, Padre, 
such that the eye could not be- 
hold without being blinded. 
Brighter than the sun.” 

“Did they make war upon 
your people?” 

“Those who approached this 
place were punished with 
spears of fire. It is told that 
in ancient times, they were of- 
ten seen flying through the 

111 




sky, trailing long tails of 
white feathers. Sometimes 
they visited the villages, de- 
manding strange things and 
frightening the people.” 

“Do the stories mention 
these tunnels ?” 

“No, Padre. The Fire Devils 
lived beneath the snow. They 
were seen to vanish into it.” 
“Without melting it?” 
“They could turn off their 
fire, perhaps. In any event, 
Padre, who knows what is pos- 
sible with demons?” 

iC T know that you need and 
-®-will receive many hours of 
strict Christian instruction. 
How is it that men returned 
to tell of these things if the 
devils pursued them with 
spears of fire?” 

“Some escaped.” 

“Is it definitely told of in- 
dividuals who were killed?” 
Dientes looked thoughtful, 
and . disappointed. “I do not 
recall the names of any who 
were slain.” 

“Bah. Why have there been 
no reports in recent years?” 
Dientes shrugged. “Quien 
sake? Perhaps the arrival of 
the true religion has driven 
away the devils.” 

“Perhaps,” said Brulieres, 
the corners of his mouth lift- 
ing slightly. He turned toward 
the tunnels. “I think, General, 
that I will ask you and the 
lieutenant to explore a little 
way into one of the tunnels. 
Come out at once if you see 
anything that might be dan- 
gerous.” 



Craig opened his mouth to 
protest, but held back the 
words. He did ache to get into 
the tunnels, but he wasn’t a 
free agent here. He watched as 
the two uniformed men disap- 
peared into the middle tunnch 
Their flashlights were quickly 
lost as they rounded some turn 
in the tunnel. 

Brulieres said to Dientes, 
“The doctor and I must take 
some samples of the rock. Will 
you be good enough to remain 
here and guard the helicop- 
ter?” He laid his hand on the 
Indian’s shoulder. “I see that 
you are not comfortable in 
your helmet. You may remove 
it if you wish. We will call to 
you if we need you.” 

Craig realized Brulieres 
wanted to talk to him alone. 
He went with the priest. The 
Indian squatted, apparently 
quite comfortable without his 
oxygen. “He is used to high 
altitudes,” Brulieres re- 
marked. “You or I could hard- 
ly remain conscious here. I 
wished to talk to you, Doctor.” 

“About what, Padre?” Craig 
felt a little awkward with the 
title. 

“About certain things in our 
country of which you do not 
approve.” 

Craig hesitated. “I... am 
here on a scientific mission.” 

“Nevertheless, you have 
ideas in the field of politics? 
I hope we can be frank with 
each other.” 

“Well... I have no inten- 
tion of being critical. As you 
know, we — that is, in the

United States the Church is 
separate from the govern- 
ment:” 

The corners of Brulieres’ 
mouth quirked. “What you 
mean, perhaps, is that you do 
not understand how the 
Church can support a totali- 
tarian government. Oh, do not 
protest; the facts are obvious. 
We have been called worse 
names than ‘totalitarian/ You 
do not think it right that the 
Church should take up actual 
arms.” 

“I — yes. Since you put it 
into words. We have a differ- 
ent concept of religion.’ , 

T HE priest nodded slowly. 

“Si. Once I visited your 
land. In a way, I envied the 
priests there. Here, we have 
had more to contend with than 
the christening of fat babies 
and listening to trifling sins 
of appetite. We are in the 
front line of battle.” 

Craig said stiffly, “Do you 
mean a spiritual battle, or an 
ideological one?” 

This time Brulieres nearly 
smiled. “Are you so certain, 
then, that they are not the 
same battle?” 

Damn it, thought Craig, I 
know better than to argue 
with a priest. He did not an- 
swer for a minute. 

Brulieres said gently, 
“Please forgive me if I am 
too direct. You do not believe 
that Evil is a real force?” 
Craig could not meet the 
penetrating eyes. The old 
doubt edged into his mind: 



what if he’s right and I am 
wrong? What if there is a 
personal God? He pushed the 
thought away, telling himself 
as he always did that it was 
just the exposure he’d suf- 
fered before he was old 
enough to think for himself. 
He said, “I’m a scientist, Pa- 
dre.” 

“But not, unless I misjudge 
you, an atheist?” 

“I call myself an agnostic, 
if you must classify me. I rec- 
ognize the possibility of some 
force behind life and mind. I 
do not believe in a God who 
is a man with a beard. Nor do 
I believe in a Devil with 
hooves and horns.” 

Brulieres nodded again,* 
“We are not so far apart as 
you may suppose, Doctor. My- 
self, I have always thought 
that one who claimed perfect^ 
faith without the trace of a 
doubt, was either an idiot or a 
liar. God surely has his rea- 
sons for not removing all 
doubt. In any case I wish to 
make my position clear to you. 
It was not happily that I took 
up what weapons were at 
hand. Had I the choice, I 
would choose quite different- 
ly.” He eyed Craig directly 
for a moment. “The battle is 
very real and very clear to 
me, Doctor. I have done what 
I must. I hope you will be- 
lieve that.” 

Craig’s skeptical mind told 
him that this was just a play 
for a good press when Craig 
got home. 

His emotions though,

wouldn’t go along. They cried 
out that he was looking upon 
sincerity. 

Ill 

T HE first tests confirmed 
what Craig had already 
presumed ; that the explosion 
had been absolutely clean. 
What radiation existed had 
originated from molecules in 
the rock itself or in the vapor- 
ized snow. 

There was no way of guess- 
ing at the type of blast; he 
only knew that mass had been 
transformed virtually one 
hundred per cent into energy 
in a very short period of time. 
No process Craig knew even 
approached it. 

He stared again at the tun- 
nel mouths. He was sure now 
that something had come out 
of them, risen about seven 
hundred feet above the pla- 
teau and released the blast. 
He trembled with eagerness 
to get inside, danger or no. 

He had turned impatiently 
to Brulieres, when some- 
where deep in the tunnels, 
shouting broke out. Two 
pistol shots echoed hollowly. 
There was a clatter of run- 
ning footsteps. Craig found 
his right hand fumbling at 
his hip, and felt foolish. He 
hadn’t carried a sidearm since 
Korea. 

Lieutenant Rabar burst 
the tunnel, stumbling in the 
sunlight, his face contorted. 
He ran straight across the 
plateau and threw himself 

ALL THAT EARTHLY REMAINS 



over the edge. Dientes, who 
had jumped to his feet, was 
only a step behind him. Craig, 
eyes fastened on the tunnel, 
realized vaguely that the two 
must have landed in deep 
snow, since there was no 
sound of their falling. 

A glow appeared in the tun- 
nel. Craig fought the panic 
that seized him ; stood his 
ground and was aware of Bru- 
lieres beside him. The glow 
brightened. 

Its source came into sight-^- 
a ball of dazzling brilliance, 
oval and about the size of a 
man’s torso. It emerged into 
sunlight and Craig saw that 
it was solid. It looked like in- 
candescent metal, but he 
somehow felt that it wasn’t 
hot. It seemed to move at will 
and to hover without support. 

It acted alive. 

It moved a little way toward 
Craig and Brulieres, then 
stopped. A tentative rumble 
came from it, like the begin- 
ning of thunder. Something 
like a tentacle lifted, clutch- 
ing an object that resembled a 
flashlight. A blinding lance of 
heat shot from the object and 
struck the rock a few yards in 
front of the two men. A sound 
came from the rock like ice 
pressed upon a hot stove. 
Smoke puffed upward. The 
beam lasted only an instant, 
but it left a long curved scar 
in the rock. 

The thing rumbled again, 
and flashed so brightly Craig 
threw an arm over his eyes, 
and heard his own voice cry 

115 




out wordlessly. His legs 
tensed to run, but something 
about the behavior of the 
thing held him where he was. 
It seemed unsure of itself, and 
not really threatening. 

When he looked up again, 
it was moving laterally and up 
the face of the wall. He saw 
the flashlight-like object on 
the ground where it had evi- 
dently been dropped. 

T HE oval thing, no longer 
glowing, lifted fast to- 
ward the mountain top. He 
saw that it was metal, not 
rusted or corroded but dull 
with age, and he saw the tv/o 
ra gg e d holes near the middle 
of it. He strained his eyes for 
more detail but it grew tiny in 
the distance and he saw no 
joints and no protuberances 
other than the one tentacle. 
He lost it in the shadows of 
the mountain’s brow, then saw 
it flash momentarily in the 
sun as it curved up and over. 

After a moment he turned 
dazedly toward Brulieres. But 
before he could say anything 
there was a sun-dimming flash 
of light from beyond the 
mountain. The ground danced. 
Sound, echoing from the oth- 
er peaks and battering its way 
through the solid rock of the 
mountain, beat about them 
like monstrous punishing 
wings. 

As the vast thunder dwin- 
dled away, Craig, squinting, 
saw a tenuous, rapidly dim- 
ming mushroom cloud tower 
above the peak. He flinched, 



but knew that this would be 
another clean explosion. Most 
of the cloud was steam. He 
was sure they were seeing a 
re-enactment of the blast 
which had cleared this pla- 
teau. 

His mind worked in simple 
patterns: the thing was de- 
stroyed ; it had dropped its 
weapon. 

He started toward the tun- 
nel mouth, but he had hesitat- 
ed too long. Brulieres, moving 
very agilely, was ahead of 
him. 

The priest picked up the 
weapon and turned toward 
Craig. Craig, still befuddled, 
wondered mildly at his own 
detached state of mind: is he 
going to kill me; I’d love to 
get that weapon home to the 
labs ; so that’s how he keeps 
warm. (The latter in reference 
to the heavy underwear he’d 
glimpsed beneath the priest’s 
cassock as the padre bent 
over). 

But Brulieres’ voice was 
mild. “Please forgive me for 
taking possession of this, 
Doctor. Later, I hope, you 
will be able to examine it; but 
I must think first of my own 
responsibilities.” He looked 
at the thing briefly, started to 
stow it in some fold of his 
gown, then hesitated. As if 
unable to resist the tempta- 
tion, he aimed it at the rock 
wall and put his thumb on 
something. 

The incandescence squirted 
out. The rock cried out and 
yielded up a curl of smoke. 



116

Brulieres turned the thing off 
at once and turned back to 
Craig with an expression half 
guilty, half delighted, like a 
child with a forbidden toy. 
Then he sighed and put the 
weapon away. 

Craig had observed what de- 
tails he could. The thing was 
an inch or a little more in di- 
ameter, perhaps ten inches 
long. All except one tip was 
dull and apparently knurled 
to give a good grip. The tip 
looked like quartz or some 
crystal, translucent except 
the end, which was darkly 
transparent when not emitting 
the beam. The trigger was ap- 
parently a spot of different 
color on the body, over which 
the thumb could be pressed. 

Craig thought of the energy 
stored in that slender cylin- 
der, the necessary insulation, 
the efficiency of whatever 
system was used to direct and 
control the beam. He felt a 
chill shiver of awe. Then an- 
other thought struck him and 
he looked wide-eyed at Bru- 
lieres. “A flaming sword 1” 

Brulieres gave him a quick 
glance, and nodded. ‘‘Primi- 
tives might describe it so.” 

R ABAR climbed back into 
sight at the edge of the 
plateau, looking pale. A mo- 
ment later Dientes poked his 
head into view. 

‘‘Where is the general?” 
Brulieres demanded. 

“Muerto,” said Fabar shaki- 
ly, “in the tunnel. The crea- 
ture killed him.” 



The priest’s face twitched. 
“Who shot at it?” 

“The general, Padre. He had 
the only gun.” 

Brulieres sighed. “Then 
that is why he is dead. The 
creature would not have 
harmed him.” 

Craig had the same idea. It 
had used the weapon more as 
if in bluff, and had apparent- 
ly carefully gone beyond the 
mountain to die. He wondered 
if the two bullet-holes had 
killed it. 

But how many more of the 
creatures (or machines) wait- 
ed in the turmels? 

He looked at Brulieres. 
“Are we going in?” 

“By all means. Unless we 
are s t o p p e d.” The priest 
looked thoughtful. “They may 
be coming out of hibernation 
or something like it. Can you 
tell how old this plateau is?” 
“Not without taking sam- 
ples to a geological labora- 
tory. Perhaps not even then, 
with accuracy. But I would 
say, some thousands of years.” 
Rabar was not happy at re- 
entering the tunnel, but set 
his jaw and came. Craig stood 
aside to let the lieutenant go 
ahead of him. Rabar hesitat- 
ed, then stepped by. Dientes, 
crossing himself and mutter- 
ing, evidently preferred com- 
ing a'ong to being left alone 
outside. He followed Craig. 

Brulieres swept his flash- 
light along the tunnel walls, 
revealing a turn ahead. They 
rounded it. After a little way 
it seemed to Craig that the 



ALL THAT EARTHLY REMAINS 



117 




flashlight dimmed. Then he 
realized that there was other 
light in the tunnel ; the arched 
ceiling was aglow. It got 
brighter and Brulieres turned 
off his flashlight. 

“Evidently,” he said, “we 
are expected. Have you no- 
ticed the air?” 

Craig had not, but he did 
now; it was warm and the 
pressure was higher than out- 
side. “One moment,” he said, 
puzzled. He went back to the 
mouth of the tunnel. As he 
stepped outside, he felt a gen- 
tle resistance as if some force 
were pushing him into the 
tunnel. He re-entered, and felt 
warmth radiating from the 
ceiling. He rejoined the oth- 
ers. 

T HE floor of the tunnel 
sloped up gently for a 
while, then leveled, then 
turned downward. The walls 
were vertical and perfect, 
with a smooth glazed look. 
The ceiling curved from wall 
to wall in a perfect arc. There 
was room for two men to walk 
side by side by crowding. 
Craig walked a little behind 
Dientes. 

Soon he took off his oxygen 
mask and breathed normally. 
He would have liked to re- 
move his jacket, but there 
were too many things in the 
pockets to spill out. 

He had counted one hun- 
dred seven paces when the 
tunnel turned again. It was 
just beyond the turn that they 
found Noriega’s body, 

118 



The tunnel branched here; 
or at least, a narrower tunnel 
angled up and off from each 
side. These tunnels were dark, 
and, Craig found, cold and 
with low air pressure. The 
same mild resistance guarded 
their mouths. The General lay 
sprawled loosely just inside 
the right-hand branch, his 
head and torso in shadow. He 
looked simply and peacefully 
dead. 

“Will you lend me a hand, 
Lieutenant?” Brulieres said. 
The two of them dragged 
Noriega into the light. 

Craig could see no burns 
nor any other kind of wound 
except an abrasion on one 
cheek which might have re- 
sulted from a fall. He started 
to ask Rabar exactly what had 
happened, but checked him- 
self. Better not appear sus- 
picious. 

He wondered what had hap- 
pened to the general’s pistol, 
and began to look around for 
it. But again Brulieres was 
ahead of him. The priest was 
eighteen or twenty yards far- 
ther into the tunnel, picking 
up something. It was the pis- 
tol. It went into the cloak as 
the heat-weapon had. 

Craig was watching Rabar 
and he thought the man 
looked disconcerted. Craig 
thought, How’s this for a 
theory: Rabar killed Noriega, 
took his pistol and started up 
the tunnel. Maybe he just 
wanted to learn for himself 
what was in the mountain, or 
maybe he planned to murder 

by C. C. MacApp 




the rest of the party and make 
it look like an accident. He 
met the glowing creature, 
panicked, put two bullets into 
it, then dropped the gun and 
ran. 

Craig wondered if the priest 
shared his doubts about Ra- 
bar; but if he did, he didn't 
show it. The priest was al- 
ready starting on. 

Craig lost count of his 
steps, but judged they'd gone 
over a quarter of a mile when 
the tunnel took a final right- 
angle turn and opened into a 
great high-domed chamber. 

IV 

I MMEDIATELY all ques- 
tion as to the nature of this 
place vanished. It could only 
be a military base. 

There's something recogniz- 
able about weapons, Craig 
mused, no matter how unfa- 
miliar. Here were gathered 
great vehicles of war, bris- 
tling with the outsize cousins 
of the heat-tube Brulieres car- 
ried and with a myriad oth- 
er menacing shapes. Yawn- 
ing black tunnels led away 
at angles — probably, Craig 
thought, to hidden exits. Re- 
pair machines, some with their 
work partly finished, were 
scattered everywhere, silent 
and with a long-unused air 
about them. Nearly all of the 
aerial dreadnaughts (Craig 
was sure they were that) 
showed terrible wounds. 

The group stared about the 
chamber in silent awe. 

ALL THAT EARTHLY REMAINS 



At one place, beneath a trio 
of round tunnels that aimed 
steeply upward, was what 
Craig took to be the main 
launching area, with ramps 
for loading. .what? The lit- 
ter showed clearly where 
great ships had rested, and 
that the departure had been 
hasty. Craig drew in deep 
trembling breaths and imag- 
ined the vast alien argosies 
lifting upon their mysterious 
legs of force. 

He could see the avarice in 
Rabar’s eyes, and edged clos- 
er to the lieutenant. He wasn't 
going to let the man overpow- 
er Brulieres and take the 
weapons, nor was he going to 
let him pick up any that 
might be lying around. Not 
that Brulieres was being care- 
less. Craig noticed that he 
kept his distance from every- 
body, and did not turn his 
back for long. 

They must have stared at 
the alien machines for quite a 
while before the priest's deep 
voice echoed in the chamber. 
“Come. Another tunnel beck- 
ons." 

Craig looked where the 
priest pointed. He saw a tun- 
nel like the one they’d left, 
about a quarter of the way 
around the chamber. It glowed 
with light. All the rest were 
dark. 

He looked again at Bru- 
lieres, and was startled at the 
man's face. It wore a look of 
glory. Craig shivered. Why, 
he thought, the man thinks 
God arranged this for him. 

119 




Apparently someone was ar- 
ranging things, unless the tun- 
nels and the lights were com- 
pletely robotic. Craig, ignor- 
ing the edge of panic that cut 
at him, followed the priest to- 
ward the entrance to the light- 
ed tunnel. 

It was short, with two bends 
in it (probably, Craig thought, 
to contain possible explo- 
sions). It opened into a small- 
er, lower-ceilinged chamber 
which had evidently been an 
assembly hall for troops, or 
possibly a mess hall. Dark 
openings led off it which 
might lead to barracks. In the 
far end, a single tunnel 
glowed with light. 

They entered that tunnel, 
which was another short one, 
and found that they were in- 
deed in the living quarters. 
These, if the analogies ap- 
plied, had been the officers’. 
There was a small assembly 
hall, and upon one wall of that 
were the pictures. 

TTHE lighting was arranged 
to fall mostly upon that 
side of the chamber. The rock 
had been smoothed to take 
the murals. The first glimpse 
shook Craig so that he walked 
mechanically toward that 
wall, momentarily forgetting 
his companions. 

A part of his mind admired 
the basic technique. Outlines 
in low relief had been cut into 
the rock, details delicately 
etched in and colors brought 
up, apparently, bv altering the 
composition of the rock itself. 

120 



As for the style it was some- 
where between realism and 
impressionism. Craig was no 
expert, but he thought the 
hand was defter, the view- 
point more penetrating, than 
any he’d ever seen. The slight 
alien air only increased the 
charm of the work. 

Whatever sort of beings the 
aliens had been, they hadn’t 
been an unfeeling race. Emo- 
tion leaped from every line of 
the murals. 

The first few told concise- 
ly of the establishment on 
Earth of this outpost, of the 
local defeat and abandonment. 
There were some heroic 
scenes there, but Craig hur- 
ried through them, drawn to 
the next series of paintings, 
yet unwilling to turn his eyes 
to them. 

They were Biblical and as 
stunningly familiar as if he’d 
lived with them all his life. 

Feeling churned at his in- 
sides again. 

One of the first immortal- 
ized Noah, or whoever had 
been the actual hero of the 
first version of the Flood 
story. The painting of the sea 
and the dark doomsday clouds 
over it was so real that Craig 
took a step backward. Moun- 
tainous wave masses were bat- 
tered white by an incredible 
rain. Heaved aslant, decks 
tumbling water, dwarfed by 
the seas, was the wooden ship. 
A few half-drowned domestic 
animals stared in terror, 
lashed to their pens on deck. 
The bearded man who stood 



by C. C. MacApp 




on wide-planted giant’s legs, 
rope-like fingers gripping a 
tiller that strained to escape, 
was bedraggled but staunch 
and muscled to meet the sea. 
A woman clung to one arm. 
She had been painted not deli- 
cately, but with a strong beau- 
ty that spoke in thunder of 
the artist’s piercing compas- 
sion. 

There was the crossing of 
the Red Sea, and the painting 
showed clearly how some 
force held aside the water. 
The artist had evidently been 
fascinated by the still-pud- 
dled seabottom. 

There were more, but Craig 
passed them, drawn like a fish 
on a line to the painting of 
the man on the cross. The 
body, more cruelly punished 
than the Bible recorded, 
strained in an agony that com- 
municated itself to Craig’s 
own. The face, twisted with 
pain, sagging with exhaustion, 
the torured soft brown eyes, 
held no bitterness, no accusa- 
tion. 

The accusation was the 
painting itself. The bitterness 
and rage (and remorse?) was 
the painter’s own. 

C RAIG, frightened and mis- 
erable, looked at the oth- 
ers. Dientes showed only awe 
and humility. Rabar was hold- 
ing himself tautly, but terror 
showed in his eyes. Brulieres 
shook with overflowing emo- 
tions, his face mirroring wor- 
ship, glory, worry and doubt. 
He met Craig’s eyes. His voice 

ALL THAT EARTHLY REMAINS 



higher-pitched and cracked 
with feeling, he said, “Have 
you noticed — this?” 

He was standing before a 
vertical slab of rough stone 
which had obviously been 
used to close up a tunnel. The 
sealing had been done with 
melted rock, roughly, leaving 
a groove around the edge. The 
job suggested haste. Craig’s 
insides writhed at what might 
lie behind the slab. 

He gripped himself, walked 
over beside the priest. He 
could make out only a few of 
the characters of the inscrip- 
tion burned into the slab. He 
heard his own voice asking, as 
if from far away, “Do... you 
read Hebrew?” 

Brulieres let out a trem- 
bling sigh. “With difficulty.” 
He moved slowly closer to the 
slab, put his fingers to the in- 
scription like a blind man 
feeling for Braille. Craig saw 
that his eyes were full of 
tears. The thin lips mumbled 
inaudibly. 

After a long time Brulieres 
quit reading and stood there, 
unmoving. Then he started to 
speak. His voice was lifeless 
now, a low uncaring mono- 
tone. “Scholars will translate 
it better, but here is the gist 
of it.” 

TO THE DESCEND- 
ANTS OF THOSE 
WITH WHOSE DESTI- 
NY I HAVE BRIEFLY 
MEDDLED: WHEN 
YOU READ THIS, YOU 
WILL HAVE A T- 

121 




TAINED A TECHNOL- 
OGY OF YOUR OWN 
WHICH WILL BE 
ABLE TO MAKE USE 
OF THE DEVICES 
LEFT HERE. ASIDE 
FROM THEM I LEAVE 
YOU MY GOOD WISH- 
ES, MY APOLOGIES, 
AND MY LOVE. 

WHEN MY RACE 
ABANDONED THIS 
PLACE I HID FROM 
THEM AND STAYED 
BEHIND BECAUSE I 
HAD FALLEN IN 
LOVE WITH YOUR 
PLANET AND YOUR 
RACE. I HAVE TRIED 
TO HELP YOU. I AM 
NOT SURE I HAVE 
DONE WELL. 

LOOK UPON MY RE- 
MAINS IF YOU WILL. 

Craig gripped the priest’s 
arm, heard his own words 
tumbling out: “It proves 
nothing, Padre! There can 
still be a God!” He found that 
he meant it desperately. 

The priest turned, stared at 
him, then looked faintly 
amused. “Conviction? Now? 
You are a more fortunate man 
than I.” 

“No, Padre! Your work! 
Religion is deeper than...” 
Brulieres’ eyes flashed with 
some of their old vitality. 
“My work? This is the God in 
whose name I have schemed 
and, Heaven help me, killed.” 
Slowly, mechanically, Bru- 
lieres drew the heat-weapon 
from his garments. He aimed 



it at the groove around the 
slab and thumbed the trigger. 
The rock skirled, and ran to 
solidify in waxlike lumps. 
The smoke was acrid in 
Craig’s nostrils. 

When the slab was mostly 
cut around, some inner seal 
gave way and air sucked loud- 
ly into the crack. With a 
wrenching sound, the slab tore 
loose. It tilted under some 
power of its own, and lowered 
itself to the floor. 

Lights, harshly angled and 
dramatic, flashed on in the 
small room beyond. It was 
bare except for the stone plat- 
form on he floor, and what 
rested upon it. 

Mechanically, Craig stepped 
in and moved aside to make 
room for the others. Brulieres 
went to the opposite side of 
the platform and Dientes 
crouched beside him. Rabar 
stood hesitantly in the door- 
way. 

T HE creature was larger 
than a man and like noth- 
ing earthly; many-limbed, 
built as if for a higher grav- 
ity. There was no apparent de- 
composition or dessication. 
The atmosphere of the cham- 
ber had evidently been chosen 
to preserve. 

There was still a pungent, 
half-unpleasant smell, being 
rapidly drawn away through 
ducts in the ceiling. There 
was a face of a sort, and two 
closed eyes. The face was rec- 
ognizably strong. The thing 
might have been called ugly, 



122 



by C. C. MacApp 




but Craig found a handsome- 
ness about it too. He recog- 
nized the drama with which 
the body was arranged and 
lighted, and somehow for this 
last small vanity he loved the 
creature even more. 

Dientes clutched at the 
priest’s robe. “It is a lie, 
Padre!” And, as the priest re- 
mained silent, Dientes turned 
desperate eyes to Craig. 
“Mother of God! Will no one 
say it is a lie?” 

Craig felt emotionally de- 
pleted. Inside him were a sick 
regret and a hollowness where 
something had died, but cold 
reason remained. If there is no 
God, he thought, we’re just in- 
telligent animals, and we’re 
free to live by our wits. If 
there is no God, then there is 
no Devil either. 

He pondered that. .and de- 
cided with grim amusement 

★★★★★★★★ 



that there was Devil enough. 

And, in any event, there 
were needs and desires, 
friends and enemies. He 
stepped swiftly around the 
alien and took the heat-weap- 
on from the priest’s limp fin- 
gers. He turned toward Rabar, 
who was (beyond any worth- 
while doubt) an enemy, and 
who was standing in the door- 
way with an annoying mock- 
ery in his eyes. Of course he’s 
happy, Craig thought; he’s a 
Bolshevik agent and an athe-

ALL THAT EARTHLY REMAINS

IF • Short Story 



BY ROBERT SCOTT 

A Bad Town For 
Spacemen 



There was a reason why the city acted the 
way it did . and we were the reason! 



T stepped back out of the gut- 
■“•ter and watched the tight 
clot of men disappear around 
the corner. They hadn’t really 
been menacing, just had made 
it obvious they weren’t going 
to break up. And that I had 
better get out of their way. I 
got. We were well trained. 

The neon of the bar across 
the street flickered redly on 
my uniform. I watched the 
slush trickle off my boots for 
a while, then made up my 
mind and headed into the bar. 
It was a mistake. 

New York had always been 
considered safe for us. Of 
course there were many parts 
of the country that were abso- 
lutely forbidden “for your 
own good” and others that 
were “highly dangerous” or at 

124 



least “doubtful.” But New 
York had always been a haven. 
The stares there had even been 
admiring sometimes, especial- 
ly in the beginning. 

But things had changed. I 
had realized that about half an 
hour after touchdown, when 
we were being herded through 
Health Check, Baggage 
Check, Security Check... you 
know the lot. Before, there 
had been friendly questions, 
genuine interest in the Mars 
colony, speculations about the 
second expedition to Venus, 
even a joke or two. This time 
the examiners’ only interest 
seemed to be in fouling us up 
as much as possible. And when 
we finally got through the rat 
race. New York was bleak. 

I should have stayed with 





the rest, I guess, and of course 
a public bar was the last place 
any smart spaceboy would 
have gone to. But I had some 
nice memories of bars, mem- 
ories from the early days. 

The whole room went silent, 
as though a tube had blown, 
when I shoved through the 
door. I got over to an empty 
table as quickly as I could and 
inspected the list of drinks on 
the dispenser. This one had a 
lot of big nickel handles stick- 
ing up over the drink names 
and the whole job was shaped 
like one of those beer kegs 
you used to see pictures of. 
What I mean is, this was an 
authentic bar. 

Phony as hell. 

F ROM the way this sounds, 
you can guess the kind of 
mood I’d gotten in. The noise 
had picked up again right af- 
ter I sat down and some of the 
drunker drunks were knock- 
ing the usual words around, in 
loud whispers and with lots of 
glances at me. One of the pro- 
girls (her hair was green and 
her blouse covered her breasts 
— another change while I was 
out) gave me a big wink and 
then jabbed the man next to 
her and squawked with laugh- 
ter. 

I fed a bill into the change 
machine at the table and then 
dribbled several coins (prices 
had gone up too) into the dis- 
penser. 

I guess I must have had sev- 
eral, because after a while I 
began to feel cheerful. The 



noise that was coming out of 
the box in the corner started 
to sound like music, and I got 
to tapping and rocking. And 
smiling, I guess. And that’s 
what triggered it. 

People had been coming and 
going, but mainly coming. 
And the crowd at the bar had 
been getting louder, and one 
guy there had been getting 
louder than the rest. All of a 
sudden, he slammed down his 
glass and headed for my table. 
He orbited around it for a 
while, staring at me, and then 
settled jerkily down in the 
chair across from me. 

“Why all the hilarity, space- 
boy? Feeling proud of your- 
self?” 

He looked pretty wobbly 
and pretty soft and pretty old. 
And very angry. But I was 
kind of wobbly myself by that 
time. And anyway there are 
strict rules about us and vio- 
lence. Very strict. So I just 
tried to make the smile bigger 
and said, “I’m just feeling 
good. We had a good run and 
we brought in some nice 
stuff.” 

“Nice stuff,” he said, kind 
of mincing. “Buddy, do you 
know what you can do with 
your sandgems and your wind- 
stones?” 

“We brought back some oth- 
er things too. There was a 
good bit of uranium and — ” 

“We don’t need it!” He was 
getting purple. “We don’t 
need anything from you.” 

“And maybe we don’t need 
you.” I was getting sort of

fired up myself. “Carversville 
is self-sufficient now. You 
can’t give us anything.” 

“Well, why the hell don’t 
you stay there? Why don’t all 
of you stay off Earth? There’s 
no place for you here.” 

I could have pointed out 
that we brought things that 
Earth really needed, that Mars 
and Venus had literally 
worlds of natural resources, 
while Earth had almost fin- 
ished hers. But he began to 
quiet down then and I began 
to feel the loneliness again, 
the sense of loss. You can’t go 
home again. .that phrase kept 
poking around in my skull. 

Suddenly he sat up and 
looked straight at me, and his 
eyes really focused for the 
first time. “What lousy luck. 
What incredibly lousy luck. 
And how could anyone have 
known?” 

It wasn’t hard to peg what 
he was talking about. “It was 
probably good luck that the 
first space crew was selected 
the way it was,” I said. “Oth- 
erwise you’d have had a dead 
ship full of dead men and no 
knowing why. But that one 
man brought the ship back.” 

“Yeah, yeah. I know. And 
the scientists figured every- 
thing out. About radiation in 
space being lethal to almost 
all types of man. But there 
was one thing that made a 
man immune. One thing.” 

“The scientists tried to find 
a protective covering that 
would be practicable. They 
tried to synthesize slaves that 



would protect you. It wasn't 
our fault that they couldn’t.” 
“No, not your fault.” His 
eyes had begun to dull again. 
“Just a matter of enough 
melanin in the skin. That’s 
all...” Then he straightened 
up and slammed his fist on the 
table. “Damn you, did you 
know I was a jet pilot a long 
time ago? Did you know I 
was going to be one of the 
space pioneers? Open up brave 
new worlds for Man...” 

He sat there staring at me 
for a minute or so and the last 
thing he said was, “Don’t you 
come here again — nigger.” 

I got up and left the table 
and walked out of the bar. I 
wasn’t provoked. As I said be- 
fore, we were well trained. 

T HE first time I realized 
where I was was when I 
bumped into the fence around 
the spacefield. I must have 
walked all the way over there 
from the bar. I had a memory 
of crumbling buildings and 
littered streets. Things had 
changed while I had been out 
there. They were letting the 
city run down. 

As I started to walk along 
the fence to the gate, I saw 
the ship towering against the 
stars. The stars and the ship. 
And tomorrow there would be 
colonists getting aboard. 

I stopped and looked till I 
knew where home was and 
who the real exiles were. 

I stopped feeling sorry for 
myself. And started feeling 
sorry for them. END

The place where reader 
and editor meet . • 



Dear Editor: 

The main purpose of my let- 
ter is to congratulate IF on its 
new format and story policy. 
But I beg to differ with Law- 
rence Crilly as regards to the 
Smith-Evans serial. (1) I real- 
ly believe that it was the worst 
SF novel I’ve ever read — at 
least in an SF magazine. (2) 
Mr. Crilly attributes this mon- 
strosity to the work of the 
Revered Ph.D. ; guess again, 
Lawrence! E. E. Smith 
couldn’t write that bad “fer 
love ner money.” 

Apart from that serial and 
Jim Harmon’s potboiler in the 
Jan. ish, IF is beginning to 
read like a good mag should, 
esp. the latest Anderson epic. 
Retief also outdid himself in 
March. 



I’m beginning to like this 
Laumer . 

T’anks also for the swell 
editorial in Volume 12 No. 1. 
I’d like to believe that my last 
year’s letter was the main rea- 
son for it. (Don’t say no!) 

Who in the deuce is John 
Pederson, Jr.? Never heard of 
him. But on the basis of his 
March cover, “that guy ain’t 
gonna be a nobody fer long!” 

Please ditch Mr. James Har- 
mon ; he makes a habit of pot- 
boilers. His The Place Where 
Chicago Was marred the fin- 
ish on an otherwise fine Feb. 
Galaxy.

The Paradise was in the 
moon. With one-sixth the 
gravity of Earth, men would 
never die. 

When Adam and Eve sinned 
they were sent to Earth. In 
six times the Moon’s gravity, 
they had to die.

Dear Editor: 

For months everyone’s been 
crying about “the art” and 
“the cover.” The cover tells 
me I am buying IF SCIENCE 
FICTION — clearly — I don’t 
think I’m getting something 
else. Inside, I’m too fascinated 
to care about the “art” — and 
I’ve “known” all the writers 
for 20-30 years. Chin up !

proved. I get it irregularly 
here; however the January 
issue inspired me to write. I 
think a magazine should have 
a letter col. 

Masters of Space was very 
good. I only read the second 
part of the serial, however, 
since I missed the November 
issue. It was similar to all the 
other stories I had read by E. 
E. Smith — exciting and magni- 
ficent in scope. By the way, is 
E. E. Evans an alternative 
pseudonym of Smith? (Like 
Wyndham-Parkes ?)

Dear Editor: 

Here I am again! Since in 
my last letter I spent my space 
discussing features, I feel that 
I should now give my opinion 
on stories. First, the February 
Galaxy. Terrific issue! I sup- 
pose I’ll rate the serial high- 
est, since there’s something 
about a novel that really car- 
ries your interest and makes 
it seem all the better looking 
back. This especially is true 
of anything by Poul Ander- 
son, who ranks with Arthur 
C. Clarke in the skill of hold- 
ing readers’ attention — and I 
thank him for the fine space 
ballad. Second place goes to 
that lovely article of super- 
extrapolation, The Martian 

HUE AND CRY 



Stargazers. Please, more of the 
same. Then there was the 
Pohl-Kornbluth novella, a 
fast-moving, highly enjoyable, 
semi-serious comedy of errors. 

For a time when Earl Kemp 
and his ilk are complaining 
that there are no new ideas in 
sf, Galaxy and If hold an 
amazing number of totally 
new conceptions. I enjoyed 
the following two stories for 
this very reason: Shatter the 
Wall and The Place Where 
Chicago Was. Willy Ley’s ar- 
ticle was interesting, as usual. 
There were only three failures 
in the whole ish, each, sadly, 
by old pros. Edward Wellen 
wasn’t funny; Algis Budrys 
wasn’t coherent ; and Fritz 
Leiber was not very earth- 
shaking, nor was his story 
good enough to stand on its 
own. Still, Galaxy is doing 
very well. 

Now If, March 1962. The 
highlight was of course Kings 
Who Die. A good example of 
serious sf in If. Had Anderson 
given it a happy ending, he 
probably wouldn’t have gotten 
his point across. Another sur- 
prisingly good story was Ty- 
balt , which ended a bit abrupt- 
ly but was nicely written. 
Then there’s the inevitable 
Keith Laumer story. They’re 
fun, I suppose, and lot of peo- 
ple seem to like them, so go 
ahead and run them. .as long 
as you limit yourselves to only 
one of this type of story per 
ish. 

Seven Day Terror was an 
amusing kid story — they’re 



129 




nice to have now and then. 
The other three stories 
weren’t particularly great, but 
they’re chock full of new ideas 
and themes. 

Good months for both maga- 
zines.

Dear Editor: 

I must say that I was flab- 
bergasted by Paul Williams’ 
letter in the March If. One of 
the best covers of the year on 
any sf mag was If’s September 
cover. Beautiful. And then 
came the November issue. 
What beauty anyone can see 
in ten different styles and 
sizes of type is beyond me. 
Not only that, but the art 
work petered out too. All 
you’re left with are “nothing” 
covers where before you had 
exciting, original ones. 

And I would lodge a stiff 
protest against the contents 
page. Why you ever changed 
it mystifies me completely. I 
would like to congratulate 
you, though, on the interior 
illos in the March issue. All 
of them are very, very good 
and a vast improvement over 
previous issues. (Whatever 
happened to Bernklau? I’d 
like to see him back.) 

Now to the stories. E Being 
and The Madman from Earth 
reflect your promise of more 
wonder in If. Both stories 
were excellent entertainment. 
Keith Laumer is great, his one 



clinker in this series being 
Gambler’s World. E Being 
was extremely original and 
well written — more like this. 
Kings Who Die was good but 
the writing seemed a little in- 
consistent. All things consid- 
ered, though, this story was 
good and it stayed interesting 
from beginning to end. Tybalt 
was fair but all the buildup 
just didn’t justify the ending. 
Dangerous Quarry was poor* 
It was fairly interesting at the 
beginning but it just didn’t 
say anything and was very 
poorly plotted. 

I cannot make up my mind 
which was worse — The Happy 
Homicide or Seven Day Ter- 
ror. These two stories repre- 
sent the lowest depths to 
which any magazine has ever 
sunk.

easy it is to put together a

you have to do is print the

That’s the way the type sets 
for another issue. Say, you fel- 
lows who mention that you 
can’t get IF regularly on your 
stands — ever think of sub- 
scribing? That way you don’t 
have to worry about getting 
your copy; the Post Office
