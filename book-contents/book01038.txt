A S an old hand at science fic- 
tion, I know what happens 
when you set your spaceship 
down on an alien world, whirl 
open the airlock, spring out 
alertly on the turf for Man’s first 
look at this strange planet, and 
out of the lush foliage comes a — 

Comes a what? 

If you’re a writer with integ- 
rity, you want something really 
new, so you go out for a thought- 
ful walk and may not return for 
days. When you do, you find 
yourself defeatedly settling for 
tentacles, antennae, extra mouths 
and/or legs, etc., etc. 

You’re not happy with the so- 
lution, but what else can you do? 
Well, friend, you need help. I’m 
trying to give it here and Willy 
Ley is doing likewise elsewhere 
in this issue. We may not suc- 
ceed, but it won’t be for want of 
trying. 

Tentacles, antennae, extra 
mouths and/or legs are all right 
for getting on with a story, when 
the aliens aren’t particularly im- 
portant, but by not challenging 
the problem, we’re leaving a 
whole area of speculation unex- 
plored. Let’s have at it, shall we? 

The big handicap, of course, is 

4 



that we have only our own planet 
to go by. However, that is better 
than having none at all. At least 
it gives us an idea of nature’s 
method of solving life problems. 

The setup we’re familiar with 
consists of vegetation living off 
soil and air, herbivores living off 
vegetation, carnivores living off 
herbivores. But is that the only 
one possible? Some plants eat in- 
sects and small animals. I don’t 
know if there are any animals 
that can subsist on minerals, but 
that doesn’t mean it can’t be. 

In one story, I built a race of 
extraterrestrials that ate rock. 
Worked out rather nicely, too, 
except that, being limited in word- 
age, I had to ignore the other life- 
forms on the planet. If it’s 
universally true that whatever 
lives off soil may be considered 
a lawn and something must mow 
it, the idea of intelligent flesh- 
eating plants isn’t absurd. 

Willy Ley, though, quotes de 
Camp to set a minimum limit to 
the size of an intelligent form. I 
disagree — on Ley’s own author- 
ity; he himself revealed that the 
Portuguese man-of-war is actu- 
ally a colony of small animals, all 
combining to make one of the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



most fearsomely efficient fishing 
forms imaginable. Ants, bees and 
termites also, by joining forces, 
evolved something remarkably 
like a civilization. At any rate, 
the only comparable society on 
Earth is mankind’s. So, if 40 
pounds is really the minimum 
body-weight for an intelligent 
creature, as he and de Camp 
agree, it can be achieved by team- 
work. 

For that matter, we can claim 
— with truth — that it takes a 
certain irreducible number of 
creatures to attain a civilization 
of any given level, if we use our 
own history as an inflexible guide. 
But would that hold if we had 
nothing but highly skilled spe- 
cialists and machines? 

Since any advanced society is 
necessarily more versatile than 
even its most versatile genius, at 
least as far as we know, the 
weight of the body politic might 
be more significant than that of 
the individual member. 

And who says the body politic 
must consist of a single species? 
Let’s go even further. Our civili- 
zation is dependent not only on 
an irreducible minimum popula- 
tion, but on an irreducible mini- 
mum of bacteria, enzymes, earth- 
worms, plants, insects— not freight 
or food animals. I’m not suggest- 
ing we give these things the vote, 
merely stating that they can’t be 
left out of the required weight of 



a civilization. Those like ours, at 
any rate. 

But aren’t other arrangements 
feasible? I think so. Trying to 
figure in advance what they might 
be is the hard job. Once we see 
how nature solves its problems, 
we generally kick ourselves for 
not having thought of the solu- 
tions. 

For instance, there’s the prob- 
lem of chewing. Birds have no 
teeth — so they use gizzards filled 
with swallowed gravel that acts 
as miniature millstones. Reptiles 
have to gulp prey whole — so 
they have digestive systems that 
would do credit to acid vats. Un- 
gulates have multiple stomachs; 
if they are frightened while graz- 
ing, they can chew when danger 
is past. 

And how about built-in cleats? 
Snakes have ’em. Or animals that 
can drown both in air and water? 
Whales, of course; being breath- 
ers, they can drown in water, but 
because of their huge size, they 
need the buoyancy of water to 
help their lungs and so drown in 
air when aground. 

Far from running out of ma- 
terial, Willy Ley and I had to 
limit ourselves severely. All it 
takes is a little research to come 
up with more than anyone can 
use. If you have any notions you 
want to share, let’s have them. 
Same with questions.

Swenson^

There were no vacuums in Space Regulations, 

so Swenson — well, you might say he knew s. 

how to plot courses through sub-ether legality! 




GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





Dispatcher 



I T WAS on October IS, 2177, 
that Swenson staggered into 
the offices of Acme Inter- 
planetary Express and demanded 
a job as dispatcher. 

They threw him out. They for- 
got to lock the door. The next 



time they threw him out, they re- 
membered to lock the door but 
forgot the window. 

The dingy office was on the 
ground floor and Swenson was a 
tall man. When he came in the 
window, the distraught Acme 




SWENSON, DISPATCHER

Board of Directors realized that 
they had something unusual in 
the way of determined drunks to 
deal with. 

Acme was one of the small her- 
maphroditic companies — hauling 
mainly freight, but shipping a few 
passengers — which were an out- 
growth of the most recent war to 
create peace. 

During that violent conflict, 
America had established bases 
throughout the Solar System. 
These required an endless stream 
of items necessary for human ex- 
istence. 

While the hostilities lasted, the 
small outfits were vital and for 
that reason prospered. They 
hauled oxygen, food, spare parts, 
whisky, atomic slugs, professional 
women, uniforms, paper for quad- 
ruplicate reports, cigarettes, and 
all the other impedimenta of war- 
time life. 

With the outbreak of peace, 
such companies faced a precari- 
ous, devil-take-the-hindmost type 
of existence. 

day that Swenson arrived 
had been grim even for Acme. 
Dovorkin, the regular dispatcher, 
had been fired that morning. He 
had succeeded in leaving the 
schedule in a nightmarish mud- 
dle. 

And on Dovorkin’s vacant 
desk lay the last straw — a Special 
Message. 



Acme Interplanetary Express 
147 Z Street 
New York 

Your atomic-converted ship 
Number 7 is hereby grounded 
at Luna City, Moon, until 
demurrage bill paid. Your pre- 
vious violations ot Space 
Regulations make our action 
mandatory. 

Planetary Commerce 
Commission 

The Acme Board of Directors 
was inured to accepting the inevi- 
table. They had heard rumors 
along Blaster’s Alley of Swenson’s 
reputation, which ranged from 
brilliance, through competence, to 
insanity. So they shrugged and 
hired him. 

His first act was to order a case 
of beer. His second was to look at 
what Dovorkin had left of a Dis- 
patch Sheet. 

“Number 5 is still blasting 
through the astraloids. It should 
be free-falling. Why the hell isn’t 
it?” 

Old Mister Cherobie, Chair- 
man of the Board, said quietly: 
“Before you begin your work, we 
would like a bit of information. 
What is your full name?” 
“Patrick M. Swenson.” 

“What does the M stand for?” 
“I don’t know.” 

“Why not?” 

“My mother never told me. I 
don’t think she knows. In the 



s 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



name of God, why don’t you send 
NumTjer 3. 

“What’s your nationality?” 

“I’m supposed to be a Swede.” 
“What do you mean, ‘sup- 
posed’?” 

“Will you open one of those 
beers?” 

“I asked you. .” 

Swenson made a notation on 
the Dispatch Sheet and spun 
around in the swivel chair. “I was 
born on a Swallow Class ship in 
space bet\Yeen the Moon and 
Earth. My mother said my father 
was a Swede. She was Irish. I was 
delivered anc| circumcised by a 
rabbi who happened to be on 
board. The ship was of Venutian 
registry, but was owned by a 
Czechoslovakian company. Now 
you figure it out.” 

“How did you happen to come 
here?” 

“I met Dovorkin in a bar. He 
told me that you were in trouble. 
You are. Is one of the Moulton 
Trust’s ships at Luna City?” 
“Yes.” 

“Then that’s why you’re 
grounded. They’ve got an in with 
the Planetary Commerce Com- 
mission. What’s the demurrage?” 
“Seventy-six thousand dollars.” 
“Can you raise it?” 

“No.” 

CWENSON glanced at the 
^ sheet. “How come Number 2 
is in New York?” 



“We’re waiting for additional 
cargo. We have half a load of 
snuff for Mars. And we’ve been 
promised half a load of canned 
goods for Luna City. It’s reduced 
rate freight that another company 
can’t handle.” 

“Dovorkin told me about the 
snuff. That’s a starter, anyway.” 
Swenson turned back to the Dis- 
patch Sheet and muttered to him- 
self; “Always a good thing to 
have snuff for Mars.” 

Mister Carobie became 
strangely interested. 

“Why?” 

Swenson paid no attention. 
‘What are you taking a split load 
for?” 

“We had no choice.” 

“You know damn well that the 
broken-down old stovepipes you 
buy from war surplus are too 
slow to handle split loads. Who 
promised you the canned goods?” 

“Lesquallen, Ltd.” 

“Oh, Lord!” said Swenson. “An 
outfit that expects lions to lie 
down with lambs!” 

The red ship-calling light 
flashed on. 

“Number 4 to dispatcher. This 
is Captain Elsing. Dovorkin. .” 

“Dispatcher to Number 4. Do- 
vorkin, hell. This is Swenson. 
What blasts?” 

“B jet just went out. Atomic 
slug clogged.” 

“How radioactive is the spout?” 
asked Swenson. 



SWENSON, DISPATCHER

“Heavy.” 

“Have somebody who’s’ already 
had a family put oft armor and 
clean up the mess,” Swenson said, 
“and alter course for Luna City. 
I’ll send you the exact course in 
a few minutes. When you get 
to Luna, land beside the Moulton 
Trust’s ship. Now stand by to 
record code.” 

Swenson reached back to 
Mister Cerobie. “Acme private 
code book.” 

Silently, the Chairman of the 
Board handed it to him. When 
Swenson had finished coding, he 
handed the original message to 
Mister Cerobie. The message 
read: 

“Captain Rising, have crew 
start fight with Moulton’s crew. 
Not much incentive will be nec- 
essary. See that no real damage is 
done. Urgent. Will take all re- 
sponsibility. Explain later. Cero- 
bie.” 

“Swenson,” Mister Cerobie said 
quietly, “you are insane. Tear 
that up.” 

With slow dignity, Swenson put 
on his coat. He stood there, smil- 
ing, and looking at Mister Cero- 
bie. The memory of Dovorkin 
stalked unpleasantly through the 
Chairman’s mind. Everything was 
hopeless, anyway. Better go out 
with a bang than a whimper. 

“All right, send it,” he said. 
“There is plenty of time to coun- 
termand — after I talk to you.” 

10 



TJ^HEN Swenson had finished 
sending the coded message, 
he turned back to Mister Cerobie. 
“What’s this I hear from Dovor- 
kin about a Senator being aboard 
Number 7 at Luna?” 

A member of the Board began: 
“After all. .” 

Mister Cerobie cut him off: 
“Your information is correct, 
Swenson. A Senator has shipped 
with us. However, I would pre- 
fer to discuss the matter in my 
private office.” 

Swenson crossed the room to 
the astrographer in the calculat- 
ing booth and said: “Plot the 
free-falling curve for Number 5 
to Mars.” Then he followed Mis- 
ter Cerobie into the Chairman’s 
office. 

Half an hour l^ter, they came 
out and Swenson went back to 
his desk. First he glanced at the 
free-falling plot Then he snorted, 
called the astrographer and fired 
him. Next he said to Mister Cero- 
bie: “Is that half load of snuff. .” 

“Yes, it is. You know Martians 
as well as I do. With their type of 
nose, they must get quite a sen- 
sation. I understand they go a bit 
berserk. That’s why their govern- 
ment outlaws snuff as an Earth 
vice. However, our cargo release 
states that it is being sent for ‘me- 
dicinal purposes.’ It’s no conse- 
quence to us what they use the 
snuff for. We’re just hauling it. 
And I don’t have to tell you how 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fantastic a rate we’re getting.” 
“To hell with the canned goods 
part of the load,” Swenson said. 
“Can you get a full haul of snuff?” 
“Possibly. But it would cost.” 
“Even this outfit can afford to 
grease palms.” 

“I’ll see what I can do.” 

“What’s the Senator on the 
Moon for?” 

“He’s supposed to make a 
speech on Conquest Day.” Mister 
Cerobie lit a cigar. “That’s day 
after tomorrow,” he added. 

“Exactly where is this elo- 
quence to be expounded?” 

Senator is speaking at 
the dedication of the new 
underground recreation dome. It’s 
just outside Luna City. They’ve 
bored a tunnel from the main 
dome cluster. This dedication is 
considered very important. Every- 
body in Luna will be there. It’s 
been declared an official holiday, 
with all crews released. Even the 
maintenance and public service 
personnel have begn cut to skele- 
ton staffs.” 

“With that fiesta scheduled on 
our beloved satellite,” said Swen- 
son, “we won’t have to worry 
about getting the Senator off for 
some time. His name’s Higby, 
isn’t it?” Mister Cerobie nodded. 
“Then he’ll whoop it up long 
enough for you to get that de- 
murrage mess straightened out.” 
“Unfortunately, it isn’t that sim- 

SWENSON, DISPATCHER 



pie. The Senator is due for an- 
other speech on Mars. The timing 
is close — he only has a minimum 
of leeway. As you mentioned. 
Number 7 is grounded for de- 
murrage. And we can’t ship the 
Senator out on Number 4 because 
of the bad jet.” 

Swenson was silent for a long 
time. The beer gurgled pleasantly 
as he drank it. Then a bright 
smile — which could have been 
due either to inspiration or beer 
— spread across his face. 

“If that idiot Dovorkin can be 
trusted,” he said, “the Senator is 
speaking in the early afternoon, 
our time. Do you happen to know 
just when he starts yapping? And 
the scheduled length of the spiel?” 

“I’ll check it.” Mister Cerobie 
turned to one of his assistants. 
Swetison took down the Luna 
Data Handbook and thumbed 
through it. 

A moment later, the assistant 
handed a slip of paper to the 
Board Chairman. 

“The Senator,” Mister Cerobie 
said, “will speak from 1300 hours 
to 1500 hours.” 

Swenson smiled and stuck a 
marker in the Luna Data Hand- 
book. 

“Now,” he said, “about this 
snuff. Can you have it loaded by 
tomorrow night?” 

“I don’t see how.” 

“Remember our agreement in 
the office. If we don’t do some- 

11 



thing, we’re through, so all we can 
do is lose. Leave me be and don’t 
ask questions. I want to blast 
Number 2 into low Earth-orbital 
tomorrow night.” 

Mister Cerobie looked off into 
that nowhere which was the daily 
destiny of Acme. “All right,” he 
said, “I was born a damn fool. I’ll 
do my best to have a full load of 
snuff aboard — somehow — to- 
morrow night.” 

Swenson went back to his Dis- 
patch Sheet. During the next five 
hours, he looked up only long 
enough to order another case of 
beer and a new astrographer. 

Finally, he called Heilberg, the 
assistant dispatcher who was on 
the night shift, gave him a lecture 
concerning dispatching in general 
and the present situation in par- 
ticular, promoted a date with one 
of the stenographers, and de- 
parted. 

W HEN Swenson came back 
the next morning, he was 
sober, ornery and disinclined to 
do any work. He cornered 
O’Toole, the labor relations man, 
and began talking women. 
O’Toole was intrigued but eva- 
sive. 

“Your trouble,” Swenson said, 
“is not with women. It’s with evo- 
lution. I don’t blame evolution for 
creating women. I blame it for 



abandoning the egg. Just when it 
had invented a reasonable method 
of reproduction which didn’t make 
the female silly-looking and tie 
her down needlessly for nine 
months ...” 

“I don’t think they’re silly- 
looking.” 

“Maybe you don’t, O’Toole, but 
I do. And you must admit that 
nine months is a hell of a long 
time to fool around with some- 
thing that could be hatched in an 
incubator under automatic con- 
trols. Look at the time saving. If 
evolution hadn’t abandoned the 
egg idea, half the human race 
wouldn’t waste time being damned 
incubators.” 

O’Toole backed away. He had 
never heard the legend of Swen- 
son’s egg speech. 

“Don’t tell me,” Swenson went 
on, “that evolution is efficient. Are 
you married, O’Toole?” 

“Yes, I 

“Wouldn’t you rather your wife 
laid an egg than — ” 

“I don’t kno.w,” O’Toole inter- 
rupted, “but I do know that I’d 
like to find out what the dispatch 
situation is at the moment.” 

Swenson grabbed a piece of 
paper and drew a diagram. 

While O’Toole was studying 
the diagram, someone laid a Spe- 
cial Message on Swenson’s desk. 
Swenson glanced at it:

CWENSON muttered: “Good!” 
^ and threw the Special Mes- 
sage in the wastebasket. Mister 
Cerobie, who had just entered the 
ollice, fished the form out and 
read it. 



“It never rains, but it pours,” 
he said. 

“You can’t stand long on one 
foot,” Swenson answered without 
looking up. “Put all your troubles 
in one basket and then lose the 
basket. Morituri te salutamus. 
Have you heard my theory about 
the advantage of reproduction via 
the egg? And get me a beer.” 

“I will get you a beer, but if 
you say a word about that egg 
theory, I will fire you. I heard you 
talking to O’Toole.” 

“Okay. We’ll forget the egg for

“Did you expect it would fall 
like manna from heaven?” Swen- 
son flipped the switch of the inter- 
com to Acme’s launching area. 
“Give me Number 2. Captain Wil- 
kins.” 

“What are you going to do?” 
Mister Cerobie asked. 

“Don’t you remember what I 
told you yesterday? Where’s that 
beer?” 

Mister Cerobie smiled, a weary, 
dogged smile, the smile of a man 
who had bet on drawing to a belly 
straight. 

“Captain Wilkins,” came over 
the intercom, “calling Swenson, 
dispatcher, for orders.” 

“Blast as soon as loaded for low 
altitude Earth-orbital.” Swenson 
was silent a moment, then: “Hell, 
don’t you know the plot? All 
right. I’ll give it to you. Full jets, 
two minutes, azimuth. .” 

Mister Cerobie interrupted qui- 
etly: “Swenson, don’t you think 
you’d better check with the astro- 
grapher?” 

Turning off the intercom, Swen- 
son spun in his chair. “Any decent 
dispatcher knows that one by 
heart. So maybe I’m wrong. Then 
Number 2 will pile up on either 
the Moon or the Earth. If that 
happens, you can collect the in- 
surance and get out of this mess.” 
He flipped on the intercom switch. 
“Sorry, Captain Wilkins, brass in- 
terference. As I was saying, 
I azimuth ...”

Swenson snapped off the inter-

Sheet, leaned back in his chair 
and closed his eyes. He was silent 
for the next half hour and drank 
three beers, looking either 
thoughtful or asleep. Mister Cero-

burned his mustache. 

When the third beer was fin- 
ished, Swenson reached for an 
astrogram blank and wrote:

FOUNDED. INFORMATION 
HERE THAT RUMOR 
STARTED BY YOUR OPPO- 
SITION. HAVE VITAL NEW 
DATA FOR YOUR LUNA 
CITY SPEECH. WILL SEND 
SPEECH INSERT AT ONCE. 

JAMES CEROBIE 

Mister Cerobie, who had been 
reading over Swenson’s shoulder, 
said: “You know that demurrage 
rumor is true.” 

“If things don’t work out and 
we have any trouble, you can say 
you hadn’t heard about the de- 
murrage. By the way, can you 
write an insert to a political 
speech?” 

“I suppose so. I’ve lied befi./re.” 
“Make sure it will take ten 
minutes to deliver — even talking 
fast — which Senators don’t usu- 
ally do.” 

“What,” inquired Mister Cero- 
bie, “shall I write about?” 

“You know that scandal Sena- 
tor Higby’s opposition just got in- 
volved in. That business about 
slave labor exploitation on Venus. 
The story broke this morning. Get 
touch with my friend Max 
Zempky on Telenews and have 



him give you some inside details. 
It doesn’t matter if they’re impor- 
tant or not. The Senator will grab 
anything that might pep up his 
speech. Besides, he’s probably 
been having a large time in Luna 
City and hasn’t heard about this 
morning’s story.” 

Mister Cerobie executed a 
sweeping bow. “Yes, sir. And if 
this thing doesn’t work, I told you 
yesterday in my office what would 
happen.” 

Swenson shrugged. “Kismet.” 

\ S Mister Cerobie opened the 
door to his private office, 
Swenson called after him: 
“Where’s this outfit’s attorney?” 

“In the Board Room.” 

“Find him and send him in 
here.” 

Mister Cerobie nodded. 

“And,” Swenson added, “be 
damned sure that speech insert 
will run at least ten minutes. 
More, if possible.” 

Mister Cerobie slammed the 
door. 

Five minutes later, slim, soft- 
spoken Van Euing, Acme’s attor- 
ney, coughed behind the dis- 
patcher’s chair. Swenson swiveled 
from coding the astrogram and 
dropped his cigarette. “What the 
hell — oh, you. Lawyers are like 
policemen — they sneak up on 
people.” 

“How did you know I was the 
firm’s attorney?” 



SWENSON, DISPATCHER

“I watched you try that unfair- 
trade-practice suit against Les- 
quallan Ltd. two years ago. It was 
snowing outside. I was broke and 
the courtroom was warm. You 
should have won the case. Some 
of their evidence looked phony 
to me. Anyway, you did a good 
job.” 

“Thank you.” 

“Did you ever stop to think 
about the advantage of the egg — ” 

“Mister Cerobie said you 
wished to speak to me.” 

“That’s right. I want you to 
draw up a something-or-other — 
you know what I mean — ground- 
ing Moulton Trust’s ship on the 
Moon until this fight hassle is 
settled.” 

“You mean you wish me to pre- 
pare a restraining order?” 

“Restrain, yeah! And restrain 
them as long as you can. I wish 
you could restrain them forever. 
This solar system would be a bet- 
ter place.” 

“On what grounds am I to base 
my order?” 

“Claim they started the fight 
and our crew’s so bashed up that 
we haven’t enough able meri to 
blast off.” 

“But I’m afraid we can’t prove 
that.” 

“And what’s it going to cost us 
to try? You’re on retainer. The 
total bill for said restraining or- 
der will be only the price of some 
legal paper and the services of a 

16 



notary. The steno’s hired by the 
month, like you.” 

Van Euing looked puzzled. 
“What good will it do?” 

“You know how long it takes 
courts to do anything. Before your 
order is tossed out, Moulton will 
have been grounded for a week.” 
Van Euing lit his pipe. “In legal 
parlance, it is something irregu- 
lar, which, being translated, means 
it’s a slick trick.” 

“All it’s going to cost you is 
being half an hour late to lunch.” 
Van Euing puffed a moment on 
his pipe and said: “Because of 
your audacity, Swenson, and fur- 
thermore, because you’ll be fired 
tomorrow. I’ll prepare the re- 
straining order.” 

Swenson put out his hand and 
his blunt fingers closed around 
Van Euing’s delicate ones. 

When Van Euing had gone, 
Swenson returned to coding the 
astrogram. He checked the form 
twice and sent it. 

Then he turned over his desk 
to an apprentice dispatcher, left 
orders to be called if anything 
broke down, and went out to 
lunch. 

¥ T was 2 : 30 p.m. when news of 
* the restraining order arrived in 
the quiet, streamlined offices of 
the Moulton Trust. Two minutes 
later, the offices were still stream- 
lined, but not quiet. 

The three major stockholders 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of the great organization, N. Ro- 
vance, F. K. Esrov, and Cecil 
Neinfurt-Whritings, formed a tiny 
huddle at one end of the long 
conference table. Esrov was wav- 
ing a copy of the order. 

“Gentlemen, we can consider 
this nothing but an outrage!” 
“Blackmail, really!” It was 
Neinfort-Whritings’s lisping voice. 

“Whatever it is, this sort of 
nonsense must be stopped at the 
beginning. It might set a prece- 
dent.” 

“May I suggest,” Rovance 
broke in, “that, as the matter of 
precedent is sure to arise, we take 
no action without first consulting 
Lesquallan Ltd.” 

“An excellent idea,” Esrov 
nodded. He switched on the inter- 
com to his first secretary. “Con- 
nect me with Lesquallan Ltd. I 
want to speak with Novell Les- 
quallan. Inform him that it is 
urgent.” 

“He just entered our office.” 
The voice that came from the 
intercom carried the slightest 
trace of surprise. “He said he de- 
sired to discuss something about 
canned goods and snuff. I shall 
send him in at once.” 

Rovance turned to Neinfort- 
Whritings. “I fear that old Cero- 
bie is becoming senile. Appar- 
ently he has lost his mind.” 

“But really, did he ever have 
one?” 

Nobody laughed. Esrov 

SWENSON, DISPATCHER 



slammed the restraining order on 
the conference table and stood 
up. “Gentlemen, what shall we do 
concerning — ” 

“Yes, gentlemen, that is just 
what I want to know.” 

Three heads pivoted. Novell 
Lesquallan, sole owner of Les- 
quallan Ltd., stood in the door- 
way. He was a broad, ruddy-faced 
man with a voice trained to basso 
interruptions. 

“I understand, Mr. Lesquallan,” 
Esrov said, “that you have a mat- 
ter to discuss with us.” 

“Yes! Sit down, F.K. We have 
some talking to do — about that 
bankrupt, dishonest Acme Inter- 
planetary Express.” 

“Quite a coincidence,” Neinfort- 
Whritings murmured. 

“You got trouble with that out- 
fit, too? That settles it. They’ve 
cluttered up the orderly progress 
of free enterprise long enough. 
Out they go.” 

Novell Lesquallan swiftly read 
the document and bellowed an 
unintelligible remark. 

“Something, quite,” Neinfort- 
Whritings agreed. 

L esquallan got his voice 

under control. “What action 
do you intend to take?” 

“We hadn’t decided,” Rovance 
answered. “We received the order 
only a few minutes ago.” 

“Before we form our plans,” 
Esrov said, “we would like some 

17 



information about your problems 
with Acme. We understand it in- 
volves canned goods and snuff.” 

“Yes, those damned. ... At the 
last minute, they turned down a 
small load of canned goods for 
Luna that we’d been decent 
enough to give them at reduced 
rates. They can’t get away with 
that kind of thing long. But that’s 
just the beginning. They got hold 
of the contract and permit to haul 
a consignment of medicinal snuff 
to Mars. We had already ar- 
ranged for that cargo. You know 
that snuff situation. Through cer- 
tain contacts, we have been able 
— perfectly legally — to have per- 
mits issued. That customs man 
must have taken a double — ” 

“We understand,” Rovance 
broke in. “We have had occasion 
to make similar arrangements. 
The rates — and other induce- 
ments — are extremely satisfac- 
tory.” 

“Well, gentlemen,” Lesquallan 
demanded, “what are we going to 
do about this unprecedented 
situation?” 

“I suggest,” Neinfort-Whritings 
said, “that we have our legal staffs 
meet in joint session. We should 
impress on them that the quash- 
ing of this restraining order is 
urgent. Perhaps we should con- 
sider debts owed us by the judi- 
ciary we helped elect.” 

“An excellent idea,” Lesquallan 
declared. “I will take care of that 



part of it myself, personally.” 

“As to the snuff matter,” Esrov 
said, “I think we should empha- 
size to our mutual contact that he 
should be more discriminating in 
issuing permits.” 

“That’s all right for now,” Les- 
quallan snapped. “But he’s , done 
with, too. I’ll see to it that he’s 
replaced.” 

“As to the canned goods situa- 
tion,” Rovance said, “it seems to 
me that we should have a subsidi- 
ary company to handle our excess 
cargoes — at reduced rates, of 
course. It shouldn’t cost too much 
to pick up one of the less finan- 
cially secure companies — such as 
Acme.” 

Esrov nodded. “An excellent 
idea.” 

“I agree,” Lesquallan said and 
sat down. “But first we must dis- 
pose of today’s damned annoy- 
ances. I suggest that we outline a 
plan for immediate action.” 

“To begin with,” Esrov re- 
minded him, “we must deal with 
the restraining order.” 

W HEN Swenson came back 
from lunch, he was not as 
sober and thus in a better mood. 
Mister Cerobie’s insert to the Sen- 
ator’s speech was on his desk. 
Swenson read the first few lines: 

As a further indication of the 
methods, devices, malfeasances, and 
corrupt practices employed, used, 
and sustained by those with whom 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you have called upon me to negoti- 
ate in the highest tribunal in Wash- 
ington, let me cite the following 
information which I have just re- 
ceived. Although this information is 
top-drawer, restricted and highly 
secret, I was able to obtain it through 
certain channels which, as a man of 
honor, I must leave undisclosed. 

The right of all creatures to be 
free is a fundamental, an inviolable, 
right and yet on Venus . 

Swenson said to himself: “Mis- 
ter Cerobie is in the wrong busi- 
ness,” and started coding the in- 
sert. He had almost finished when 
the ship-calling light flashed red. 

“Number 5 to Dispatcher. Cap- 
tain Verbold speaking.” 

“Dispatcher to Number 5. This 
is Swenson. Go ahead.” 

“I’m afraid you can’t help me. 
May I speak to Mister Cerobie?” 
“He’s out to lunch.” 

“This matter is serious. I am 
faced with what amounts to mu- 
tiny.” 

“Sorry, but I got troubles, too. 
Maybe I can find Mister Cerobie, 
maybe I can’t. Why don’t you tell 
me your grief?” 

Captain Verbold hesitated. “It’s 
something I’ve been expecting. 
The crew has stated that they will 
leave the ship at Mars.” Captain 
Verbold’s next sentence was pro- 
nounced word by word in code. “I 
even have private information 
that there is a plot to take over 
the ship and blast directly to 
Earth, where the crew feel their 

SWENSON, DISPATCHER 



case can be more justly pre- 
sented.” 

“What are they squawking 
about?” 

“Everything. Wages have not 
been paid for six months. Poor 
radiation shielding. Food not up 
to standard. You know the story.” 
“It’s not the first time I’ve 
heard it.” 

“What am I to do?” 

??¥^IRST, read them section 
942 in your copy of Space 
Regulations,” said Swenson. “If 
they divert ship from Mars with- 
out your permission, it’s mutiny. 
That means the neutron death 
chamber or, if they are very 
lucky, life sentences to the Luna 
Penal Colony. Get them all to- 
gether and read it to them. You’re 
free-falling now, so even the jet- 
ters won’t have to be on duty.” 
“But if I could talk to Mister 
Cerobie — ” 

“I’ve already told you I don’t 
know where the hell he is. He 
couldn’t do you any good, any- 
way. Didn’t you ever read Space 
Regulations? Section 19: ‘The 
captain of a ship in flight is solely 
responsible for the maintenance 
of discipline and his orders can- 
not be changed or overruled’.” 
“Swenson, you said a moment 
ago that this was your first sug- 
gestion. I presume, therefore, that 
you have others.” 

“I have two others.” Swenson 

19 



paused long enough for a brief 
study of his Master Ship Location 
Chart, which he had just brought 
up to date. The chart showed the 
position of all ships at the mo- 
ment in space. “There’s a patrol 
cruiser loaded with gendarmes 
three million miles behind you 
on a course paralleling yours. It’s 
one of the new Arrow Class and 
if they blast full, they can catch 
you in ten hours. Mention to the 
crew that you could notify the 
police boys and have them pick 
you up and escort you to Mars.” 
“What is the patrol ship’s num- 
ber and call letters?” 

“Arrow — British — Earth —num- 
ber 96. Call letters MMXAH.” 
“Thanks. If things get too bad, 
I might take advantage of our val- 
iant guarders of the spaceways. 
All right, you said you had three 
suggestions. What’s the third?” 
“Some goons on a Moulton 
Trust ship, parked beside our 
number 2 on the Moon, started a 
fight and beat up our boys. We’re 
about to sue Moulton for plenty. 
Tell your crew about it and sug- 
gest that if they behave, we’ll cut 
them in on the proceeds from the 
suit, in addition to paying their 
wages as soon as a snuff cargo 
that I had to send into orbital 
gets to Mars.” 

“On whose authority am I to 
make such a statement?” 

“Swenson’s. You don’t need any 
other, do you? I know most of 

20 



the boys on your mobile junk- 
yard. They trust me, so they’ll 
trust you. You have my word that 
Cerobie will go for the idea.” 
“You talk to Cerobie and let 
me know what happens. Mean- 
while, I’ll think over your sug- 
gestions.” 

T he ship-calling light blinked 
off and Swenson went back to 
coding the speech insert. 

As he was finishing, O’Toole 
came in. 

Swenson looked up. “O’Toole, 
sure and it’s one hell of a job 
you’re doing. You’ve got" me in a 
fight with myself. My Swedish 
half wants to ignore you and my 
Irish half wants to punch you in 
the nose. You’re supposed to han- 
dle labor relations. And I just re- 
ceived a message from Captain 
Verbold of Number 5 that his 
crew is about to mutiny.” 

“Mother of God, what can I 
do?” cried O’Toole. “This out- 
fit’s so broke, it doesn’t have 
enough money to pay the filing 
fee for bankruptcy.” 

“In the face of adversity, you 
should spit.” 

“Who are you quoting?” 

“Me.”, 

“Look, Swenson, I’m supposed 
to supervise labor relations, sure. 
Labor is something you hire. 
That’s done by paying wages — 
on time.” 

“At least you should have 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



brains enough to understand the 
advantage of the egg.” 

“What?” asked O'Toole blankly. 
“I’ve already explained it to 
you. Apparently it didn’t get past 
your hair. I shall therefore make 
a second attempt. Do you under- 
stand the principle of the egg?” 

“I don’t-” 

“Of course not. You never 
stopped to analyze it. You just 
assumed that because human be- 
ings are born the way they are, it 
is the best method. How much 
pain and trouble does a hen have 
laying an egg? Does she — ” 

“Getting back to number 5,” 
O’Toole said firmly, “what did 
Captain Verbold — ” 

“Consider the advantage of the 
egg from another angle, O’Toole. 
Let’s say your wife lays an egg 
and, at the moment, you don’t 
have money enough to support 
another child. All you would have 
to do is put the egg in cold stor- 
age until your ship comes in. 
Then you can take the egg out 
and incubate it. Instead of be- 
ing — ” 

The click of the latch as 
O’Toole closed the door caused 
Swenson to spin in his chair. Toss- 
ing his pencil on the Dispatch 
Sheet, he put on his coat and went 
home. 

W HEN the dispatcher for 
Acme Interplanetary Express 
arrived at the office the following 



morning, a Special Message lay 
in sublime isolation on his desk. 
Swenson opened a beer and read 
the message. 

Board of Directors 

Acme Interplantary Express 

Gentlemen: 

Your restraining order con- 
cerning our ship at Luna City 
can only be considered as rep- 
resenting a warped and intol- 
erable concept of justice. We 
will take every legal action 
available to us. 

Moreover, your action in re- 
fusing, without notice, a load 
which we were so kind as to 
offer you and your immoral 
dealings in contraband snuff 
force us to sever all commer- 
cial relations with your organi- 
zation. 

We are taking appropriate 
action with the Planetary Com- 
merce Commission. 

Yours sincerely, 
Moulton Trust 
Lesquallan Ltd. 

Swenson was smiling cherubic- 
ally and bringing his Master 
Chart up to date when O’Toole 
came in. 

“Swenson, did you have eggs 
for breakfast? And how goes with 
the dispatch?” 

Carefully noting the last change 
of ship position on the Master 
Chart, Swenson turned to O’Toole. 



SWENSON, DISPATCHER 



21 



“Things are like so,” he said, 
and drew a diagram. 

While O’Toole was studying 
the diagram, Swenson placed a 
call to Moulton Trust. “Give me 
Eisrov. Yes, Esrov himself. This 
is Swenson, Acme Interplanetary. 
If Esrov doesn’t want to talk to 
me, jets to him, but I think I have 
some information he can use.” 

“Will you please hold on, Mr. 
Swenson? I will convey your mes- 
sage.” 

Swenson looked at O’Toole for 
a moment in silence. “No, I don’t 
like eggs for eating. My theory 
concerns another aspect—” 



“I know,” said O’Toole resign- 
edly. 

17 SROVs urbane voice came 
from the desk speaker. “Mr. 
Swenson, you have some infor- 
mation for us?” 

“Yes, E^rov. I’ve just seen your 
message to our Board and I want 
you to know that I can certainly 
understand your pnasition. I could 
not prevent the restraining order. 
However, I have a suggestion as 
to what you can do about it.” 
“We are doing everything we 
can.” 

“Didn’t you support Senator 




22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Higby for re-election last year? 
Well, he has shipped with us on 
an inspection tour of planetary 
outposts. Right now, he’s on the 
Moon and will speak at 1:30 this 
afternoon at the official op>ening of 
the new Recreation Center. It oc- 
curred to me that it might be 
worthwhile for you to send him a 
message suggesting that he incor- 
porate in his speech something 
about the laxity of the Planetary 
Commerce Commission that al- 
lowed you to get into this mess.” 
“An excellent idea, Mr. Swen- 
son. We shall give it immediate 
consideration. And, by the way, if 
for any reason your employment 
with Acme should terminate, we 
should be able to find a suitable 
position for you with our com- 
pany.” 

“Thanks, Esrov.” Swenson 
switched off the set. 

“You dirty, stinking,” O’Toole 
blared, “doublecrossing — ” 

“Calm down, O’Toole. Don’t get 
off the rocket until she’s on the 
ground. I’ve got reasons.” 

“Reasons? You haven’t even 
got reason! And you’re a crook!” 
“Now don’t let my Irish half 
get on top. I want that Senator to 
talk as long as possible. Let’s go 
back to the egg.” 

“Youve laid it.” 

“For the last time, let me ex- 
plain. If evolution had followed 
my theory, I, being a man, would 
not lay eggs. Women would and 

SWENSON, DISPATCHER 



therefore they would escape — ” 

“Swenson,” Mister Cerobie 
called from the door of the Board 
Room, “you are hired — tenta- 
tively — as a ’ dispatcher, not an 
egg-evolution theorist. Now come 
in here. The Board wants to talk 
to you.” 

Swenson jerked the diagram 
out of O’Toole’s hand and fol- 
lowed Cerobie. 

Ten minutes later, he came out 
of the Board Room, saying: “Gen- 
tlemen, the Senator speaks at 
1:30 this afternoon. At 6:00 
either fire me, crucify me and 
make me drink boiled beer alone, 
or give me a raise.” 

^ I ■'HE clock on the wall over the 
-*■ dispatcher’s desk showed 2 : 59 
when Swenson called Acme’s 
Luna City Terminal. “Dispatcher 
to Numbers 7 and 4, have crew 
stand by to blast off in exactly 
15 minutes. I don’t give a damn 
about regulations or the P.C.C. 
This is an order from your com- 
pany. It must be obeyed. Number 
7 will follow course as originally 
planned — destination Mars. Num- 
ber 4 will blast for Earth, curve 
to be given in space.” 

Fifteen minutes later, the dis- 
patcher’s office at Acme Inter- 
planetary Express was quieter 
than an abandoned and forgotten 
tomb. The Board of Directors 
stood silently in a semi-circle be- 
hind Swenson. Every employee, 

23 




even the stenographers, were 
jammed into the frowsy room. 

As the hand of the clock sliced 
off the last second of the 15 min- 
utes, Swenson looked over his 
shoulder — and laughed, a great, 
resounding laugh. Then he flicked 
the switch and picked up the mi- 
crophone. 

“Swenson dispatcher to 7 and 
4. Blast! Over. Swenson dis- 
patcher to 4 and 7. Blast!” 

Suddenly the silent room was 
filled with the roar of the jets as 
they thundered in the imagina- 
tions of the men and women 
crowded around the dispatcher’s 
desk. The tension broke as almost 
a sob of gladness. What if it 
proved a hopeless dream, a mere 
stalling of inevitable ruin? They 
were no longer grounded. They 
were in space. 

To those in the room, it seemed 
only an instant until the ship- 
calling light flashed on. “Number 
7 to dispatcher. In space. All 
clear.” 

“Dispatcher to Number 7, 
steady as she goes.” 

The red light was off for a 
moment. Then: “Number 4 to 
dispatcher. In space. All clear.” 

“Dispatcher to Number 4. Tem- 
porary curve A 17. Will send ex- 
act curve plot in half an hour.” 
Swenson turned to the astrogra- 
pher. “Give me a plot for Chicago. 
I don’t want to land her in this 
state. Just a matter of prudence. 

24 




SWENSON, DISPATCHER 



25 



She’s registered in this state.” 

The astrographer shouldered 
his way through the crowd. When 
he reached the calculators, his 
swift fingers began pushing but- 
tons. Swenson leaned back. 

“Mischief, thou art a’space,” he 
said. “Now take whatever course 
thou wilt.” 

AT 3:30, Swenson reached 
again for the microphone. 
“Dispatcher to Number 2. You 
are circling Earth at low orbital. 
Decelerate and drop to strato- 
sphere. Maintain position over 
New York. Curve and blasting 
data. .” . 

At 4 : 00, he called Max Zempky 
at Telenews. “Anything frying at 
Luna?” 

“My God, yes! Senator Higby 
yapped sixteen minutes overtime 
and the shadow knife-edge caught 
everybody with their air tanks 
down. The control crews were lis- 
tening to the speech and there 
wasn’t anybody left to switch over 
the heating-cooling system. 
You’ve been to the Moon, so you 
know what happens. When day 
changes to night and you haven’t 
got any atmosphere, the tempera- 
ture drops from boiling to practi- 
cally absolute zero. Sure, the au- 
tomatic controls worked, but 
there wasn’t any crew to adjust 
and service the heaters and cool- 
ers. It’s a mess. Say, haven’t you 
got a ship or two up there?” 



“I got ’em out in time.” 

“Well, Moulton didn’t. Their 
ship’s been considerably dam- 
aged.” 

“Thanks, Max. Let me know if 
anything else breaks.” 

While Swenson had been talk- 
ing, two Special Messages and an 
astrogram had been laid on his 
desk. He first read one of the 
Special Messages. 

Acme Interplanetary Express 
147 Z Street 
New York 
Gentlemen : 

We are holding you respon- 
sible for the damage to our ship 
Number 57, now on the Moon. 
The captain of your ship should 
have known the potential dan- 
ger and warned Senator Higby 
of the time factor. 

We will contact the PCC at 
once. 

F. K. Esrov 
Moulton Trust 

Swenson scribbled an answer 
and handed it to an assistant. 

Moulton Trust 

Nuts, Esrov. You’ve got to 
think up something better than 
that. We have no control over 
public officials, except during 
flight. Bellyache all you want 
to the PCC. 

Sedately, 

Swenson

Swenson replied: 

UNFORTUNATE CIRCUM- 
STANCE UNAVOIDABLE. 
YOUR SPEECH MAGNIFI- 
CENT. WILL MAKE EVERY 
EFFORT TO SECURE IM- 
MEDIATE TRANSPORTA- 
TION TO MARS. 

SWENSON 

T he second Special Message 
was from the PCC and asked 
with crisp and blunt formality 
why two Acme ships, which had 
been officially grounded by the 
Commission, had blasted off the 
Moon. 

In answer, Swenson was mild 
and apologetic. What else could 
he have done? Surely the Com- 
mission must understand that his 
first duty was to save his ships 
from damage. He had been in- 
formed by his captains that the 



shadow knife-edge was almost 
due, and there was no possibility 
of the control crews servicing the 
temperature-change compensators 
in time. It was an emergency. The 
matter of the grounding could be 
settled later. 

When his answer was finished, 
he coded it, along with the Special 
Message from Moulton Trust, the 
astrogram from Senator Higby, 
and his replies. Finally, he coded 
the Special Message from PCC. 
Then he called Number 5. 
“Number 5 to dispatcher. This 
is Verbold. What goes on now?” 
“You tell me. Dwelleth thy 
household in peace?” 

“For the moment.” 

“Have you followed my in- 
structions?” 

“In general, yes.” 

“Did your crew hear Senator 
Higby’s speech?” 

“Most of them. What else is 
there to do in this rat-trap?” 

“I could think of a lot of things. 
But as long as the crew heard the 
Honorable’s spiel, that’s all that 
matters. Do you know about the 
little affair half an hour ago at 
Luna City?” 

“No.” 

“Check your news recorder. 
Have the item broadcast to the 
crew. Then decode the sequence 
of messages I’m about to send and 
read them — at your discretion — 
to the men. Stand by to record 
code.” 



SWENSON, DISPATCHER

When he had finished, Swenson 
leaned back and opened a beer. 
“All we can do now is wait. But 
I’d give my grandmother’s immor- 
tal soul, if the old shrew had one, 
to be in the sacred sanctum of 
Moulton Trust.” 

T ESQUALLAN sat on the edge 
^ of the long table in Moul- 
ton’s Board Room. He spoke 
slowly and for once his voice was 
low; 

“Esrov, did you or did you 
not suggest to our Senator Higby 
that he lengthen his speech on the 
Moon to include certain new in- 
formation? And did that informa- 
tion involve my company along 
with yours?” 

“Mr. Lesquallan, the matter 
concerns only a minor aspect of 
policy,” said Esrov placatingly. 

“Minor aspect of policy, hell! 
It concerns business. Look what 
happened at Luna. And you let us 
get publicly involved in it. Such 
matters must never be handled 
openly.” 

Esrov did not answer. 

“Did you send such a message, 
Rovance?” Rovance shook his 
head. Lesquallan turned to Nein- 
fort-Whritings. “Did you?” 

“No, Lesquallan.” Neinfort- 
Whritings gently pulled a Special- 
Message form from beneath Es- 
rov’s folded hands as they lay on 
the gleaming conference table. 

Lesquallan swung back to Es- 



rov. “Did you send it?” 

Esrov looked down at his 
folded hands. At last he said qui- 
etly: “Yes, I sent a message to the 
Senator — in our mutual inter- 
ests.” 

“Was it your own idea? Or did 
someone else suggest it?” 

“The basic thought came from 
a most unexpected source. It was, 
we might say, one of those happy 
breaks of industry. The dispatcher 
at Acme had the sense to cooper- 
ate with us. He gave me certain 
otherwise unavailable informa- 
tion, and—” 

“What was his name?” 

“I don’t— oh, yes, it was Swen- 
son.” 

“You . you fool . idiot!” 
Neinfort-Whritings handed Les- 
quallan the Special Message he 
had taken from Esrov. It was the 
one from Swenson, which began: 
“Nuts, Esrov.” 

Lesquallan read the message. 
Then he said slowly: “I’ve dealt 
with that clown Swenson before — 
over minor matters. I never 
thought he had that much brains.” 
He looked at Esrov. “Or insight. 
Swenson’s a smart man. There- 
fore, he must be eliminated.” 

“I still maintain,” Rovance said, 
“that the basis of the matter is 
the strangling of free enterprise.” 
“I agree,” said Lesquallan^ 
“What right has Acme to inter- 
fere with free enterprise? They 
haven’t a dollar to our million.”

“What shall we do?” Neinfort- 
Whritings murmured. 

“Follow Swenson’s suggestion. 
We’re going to the PCC — and 
we’re going to our top contacts. 
They owe us plenty.” 

“Shall we dictate a memo?” 
Esrov put in. 

“Call the PCC,” Lesquallan 
ordered. “We’re not dictating any- 
thing. And we’re not sending any 
messages to anybody. Let the 
PCC send them!” 

IVO employee of Acme Inter- 

’ planetary Express had left 
the smoke-dense office when the 
ship-calling light went on: “Num- 
ber S to Swenson. Verbold speak- 
ing.” 

“Dispatcher to Number 5. Go 
ahead.” 

“Uproar under control. I fol- 
lowed your instructions. A crew 
that’s laughing won’t mutiny. The 
crew sends thanks and their most 
pious wishes for the distress of 
Moulton. The men expect shares 
of the proceeds, if any, in the law- 
suit. But they insist on being paid 
on Mars.” 

“They will be. Captain Verbold. 
Now I‘ve got to keep this beam 
clear. Good luck.” Swenson turned 
to Mister Cerobie. “I presume you 
can at least find enough cash for 
the back pay?” 

Mister Cerobie did not answer. 
He was staring at a Special Mes- 
sage which had just been handed 



to him. He dropped it on Swen- 
son’s desk. 

Acme Interplanetary Express

Because of your violation of

dispatched to insure your com- 
pliance with our order.

Swenson read the message and 
looked up. 

“Well?” asked Mister Cerobie. 
The murmur of voices died. 
The dispatcher’s office of Acme 
Interplanetary Express was a si- 
lent, isolated world. Swenson 
wrote an astrogram and handed 
it to the Chairman of the Board. 
“Shall I code it?” 

Mister Cerobie read the astro- 
gram. He read it a second time 
and his perplexity vanished. 
“But will it work?” he asked. 
Swenson shrugged. “It ought to. 
Remember what happened when 
Solar System Freight lost that 
chemical load? We’re stratospher- 
ing over New York. Anyway, he 
wouldn’t dare take the chance. 
Shall I code it. Mister Cerobie?” 
“Absolutely!”

^ I 'HE men and women of Acme 
crowded and squirmed for a 
look at the astrogram on Swen- 
son’s desk. O’Toole realized first 
and yelled. Slowly, as understand- 
ing came, other voices took it up, 
until the office was a chaos of 
sound. Bottles appeared from no- 
where. O’Toole raised one of them : 
“Sure and St. Patrick would have 
loved it!” 

Calmly, Swenson coded:

The dispatcher for Acme said 
to himself: “I doubt very seri- 
ously if any sane Senator up for 
re-election would want the official 
records to show that, because he 
talked too long on the Moon, a 
cargo of snuff was dumped over

Twenty minutes later, the re-

A ND that, Mister Cerobie,” 
■^^said Swenson, “is how you 
slide out of a jam. You’ll get 
enough cash for that snuff haul 
to Mars to pay the crew of Num- 
ber 5 when she lands there. And 
you’ll have enough left over to 
pay the demurrage and repair 
charges at Luna. Now open me a 
beer.” 

Mister Cerobie opened the beer 
wearily. 

“You’re fired, Swenson,” he 
said. “I’ll be damned if I’ll write 
another speech or be your bar- 
tender.” 



Swenson drank and smiled. 
The ship-calling light flashed 
red. “Number 3 to dispatcher.

partment holed by meteorite. 
Cannot land on Ganymede until

Transferring the beer to his 
other hand, Swenson grabbed the 
microphone. “Dispatcher to Num-

FORECAST 

When Frederik Pohl's SLAVE SHIP concludes next month, you won't hove to apologize 
for sagging in relief, as at the end of a particulorly tense and deadly mission — for 
this tautly suspenseful serial has hurled you, alive and fearful, into a future that makes 
frightening sense. For instance, you know now that it's possible to kill by the millions — 
but, considering our horrible nuclear and bacteriological arsenal, it can't be done under 
the name of "warl" And these first two installments have shown exactly why "universal 
conscription" must be so universal that it includes not only men, women and children, 
but animals as well! The vital key to the destructive non-war, though, is the Glotch, that 
hideous weapon which can kill anyone anywhere, no matter how far from the Cow-dye 
enemy or how well concealed. Wait till you discover what it is and how it works — and 
just who its victims are! 

Almost five years ago, Wyman Guin's novella BEYOND BEDLAM burst into these 
pages with a shock that is still influencing stories being written now. Evidently that 
dazzling effort took so much out of Guin that he wearily went bock to being vice-- 
president of Lakeside Laboratory. Now, finally recovered and filled with vitamins made 
by his company, he returns with VOLPLA, a novelet that turns tragic because, para- 
doxically, it has a "happy" ending! The protagonist, you see, always felt that the only 
gag worth pulling was a cosmic one — until he finds out that the Cosmos has a really 
nasty sense of humor! ^ 

Another novelet, of course, plus short stories and our regular features . Including 
some thoroughly documented fish stories by Willy Ley that should make you wonder if 
we've really left the past behind usl

PROTECTION 



By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

I had the finest bodyguard on 
any world to protect me . but 
what was it that watched him? 

Illustrated by RAY 



T HERE’LL be an airplane 
crash in Burma next week, 
but it shouldn’t affect me 
here in New York. And the feegs 
certainly can’t harm me. Not with 
all my closet doors closed. 

No, the big problem is lesneriz- 
ing. I must not lesnerize._ Absol- 
utely not. As you can imagine, 
that hampers me. 

And to top it all, I think I’m 



catching a really nasty cold. 

The whole thing started on the 
evening of November seventh. I 
was walking down Broadway on 
my way to Baker’s Cafeteria. On 
my lips was a faint smile, due to 
having passed a tough physics 
exam earlier in the day. In my 
pocket, jingling faintly, were five 
coins, three keys and a book of 
matches. 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Just to complete the picture, 
let me add that the wind was 
from the northwest at five miles 
an hour, Venus was in the ascen- 
dancy and the Moon was de- 
cidedly gibbous. You can draw 
your own conclusions from this. 

I reached the corner of 98th 
Street and began to cross. As I 
stepped off the curb, someone 
yelled at me, “The truck! Watch 
the truck!” 

I jumped back, looking around 
wildly. There was nothing in 
sight. Then, a full second later, a 
truck cut around the corner on 
two wheels, ran through the red 
light and roared up Broadway. 
Without the warning, I would 
have been hit. 

Y OU’VE HEARD stories like 
this, haven’t you? About the 
strange voice that warned Aunt 
Minnie to stay out of the eleva- 
tor, which then crashed to the 
basement. Or maybe it told Uncle 
Joe not to sail on the Titanic. 
That’s where the story usually 
ends. 

I wish mine ended there. 
“Thanks, friend,” I said and 
looked around. There was no one 
there. 

“Can you still hear me?” the 
voice asked. 

“Sure I can.” I turned a com- 
plete circle and stared suspi- 
ciously at the closed apartment 
windows overhead. “But where 



in the blue blazes are you?” 
“Gronish,” the voice answered. 
“Is that the referrent? Refrac- 
tion index. Creature of insubstan- 
tiality. The Shadow knows. Did 
I pick the right one?” 

“You’re invisible?” I hazarded. 
“That’s it!” 

“But what are you?” 

“A validusian derg.” 

“A what?” 

“I am — open your larynx a 
little wider please. Let me see 
now. I am the Spirit of Christmas 
Past. The Creature from the 
Black Lagoon. The Bride of 
Frankenstein. The — ” 

“Hold on,” I said. “What are 
you trying to tell me — that 
you’re a ghost or a creature from 
another planet?” 

“Same thing,” the derg replied. 
“Obviously.” 

That made it all perfectly 
clear. Any fool could see that the 
voice belonged to someone from 
another planet. He was invisible 
on Earth, but his superior senses 
had spotted an approaching dan- 
ger and warned me of it. 

Just a plain, everyday super- 
normal incident. 

I began to walk hurriedly 
down Broadway. 

“What is the matter?” the in- 
visible derg asked. 

“Not a thing,” I answered, “ex- 
cept that I seem to be standing 
in the middle of the street talk- 
ing to an invisible alien from the 



PROTECTION 



33 



larthest reaches of outer space. 
I suppose only I can hear you?” 
“Well, naturally.” 

“Great! You know where this 
sort of thing will land me?” 

“The concept you are sub-vo- 
calizing is not entirely clear.” 
“The loony bin. Nut house. 
Bug factory. Psychotic ward. 
That’s where they put people who 
talk to invisible aliens. Thanks 
for the warning, buddy. Good 
night.” 

F eeling light-headed, I 
turned east, hoping my invisi- 
ble friend would continue down 
Broadway. 

“Won’t you talk with me?” the 
derg asked. 

I shook my head, a harmless 
gesture they can’t pick you up 
for, and kept on walking. 

“But you must,” the derg said 
with a hint of desperation. “A 
real sub-vocal contact is very rare 
and astonishingly difficult. Some- 
times I can get across a warning, 
just before a danger moment. But 
then the connection fades.” 

So there was the explanation 
for Aunt Minnie’s premonition. 
But I still wasn’t having any. 

“Conditions might not be right 
again for a hundred years!” the 
derg mourned. 

What conditions? Five coins 
and three keys jingling together 
when Venus was ascendant? I 
suppose it’s worthy of investiga- 

34 



tion — but not by me. You never 
can prove that supernormal stuff. 
There are enough people knitting 
slipcovers for straitjackets with- 
out me swelling their ranks. 

“Just leave me alone,” I said. 
A cop gave me a funny look for 
that one. I grinned boyishly and 
hurried on. 

“I appreciate your social situa- 
tion,” the derg urged, “but this 
contact is in your own best inter- 
ests. I want to protect you from 
the myriad dangers of human ex- 
istence.” 

I didn’t answer him. 

“Well,” the derg said, “I can’t 
force you. I’ll just have to offer 
my services elsewhere. Good-by, 
friend.” 

I nodded pleasantly. 

“One last thing,” he said. “Stay 
off subways tomorrow between 
noon and one-fifteen p.m. Good- 
by.” 

“Huh? Why?” 

“Someone will be killed at Col- 
umbus Circle, pushed in front of 
a train by shopping crowds. You, 
if you are there. Good-by.” 

“Someone will be killed there 
tomorrow?” I asked. “You’re 
sure?” 

“Of Course.” 

“It’ll be in the newspapers?” 

“I should imagine so.” 

“And you know all sorts of 
stuff like that?” 

“I can perceive all dangers 
radiating toward you and extend- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing into time. My one desire is to 
protect you from them.” 

I had stopped. Two girls were 
giggling at me talking to myself. 
Now I began walking again. 

“Look,” I whispered, “can you 
wait until tomorrow evening?” 

“You will let me be your pro- 
tector?” the derg asked eagerly. 

“I’ll tell you tomorrow,” I said. 
“After I read the late papers.” 

^I^HE item was there, all right. 

-*• I read it in my furnished 
room on 113th street. Man 
pushed by the crowd, lost his 
balance, fell in front of an on- 
coming train. This gave me a lot 
to think about while waiting for 
my invisible protector to show up. 

I didn’t know what to do. His 
desire to protect me seemed genu- 
ine enough. But I didn’t know if 
I wanted it. When, an hour later, 
the derg contacted me, I liked the 
whole idea even less, and told 
him so. 

“Don’t you trust me?” he 
asked. 

“I just want to lead a normal 
life.” 

“If you lead any life at all,” he 
reminded me. “That truck last 
night — ” 

“That was a freak, a once-in-a- 
lifetime hazard.” 

“It only takes once in a lifetime 
to die,” the derg said solemnly. 
“There was the subway, too.” 

“That doesn’t count. I hadn’t 



planned on riding it today.” 

“But you had no reason not to 
ride it. That’s the important 
thing. Just as you have no reason 
not to take a shower in the next 
hour.” 

“Why shouldn’t I?” 

“A Miss Flynn,” the derg said, 
“who lives down the hall, has just 
completed her shower and has 
left a bar of melting pink soap on 
the pink tile in the bathroom on 
this floor. You would have slipped 
on it and suffered a sprained 
wrist.” 

“Not fatal, huh?” 

“No. Hardly in the same class 
with, let us say, a heavy flowerpot 
pushed from a rooftop by a cer- 
tain unstable old gentleman.” 

“When is that going to hap- 
Ijen?” I asked. 

“I thought you weren’t inter- 
ested.” 

“I’m very interested. When? 
Where?” 

‘Will you let me continue to 
protect you?” he asked. 

“Just tell me one thing,” I said. 
“What’s in this for you?” 

“Satisfaction!” he said. “For a 
validusian derg, the greatest thrill 
possible is to aid another creature 
evade danger.” 

“But isn’t there something else 
you want out of it? Some trifle 
like my soul, or rulership of 
Earth?” 

“Nothing! To accept payment 
for Protecting would ruin the

emotional experience. All I want 
out of life — all any derg wants 
— is to protect someone from the 
dangers he cannot see, but which 
we can see all too well.” The derg 
paused, then added softly, “We 
don’t even expect gratitude.” 
Well, that clinched it. How 
could I guess the consequences? 
How could I know that his aid 
would lead me into a situation in 
which I must not lesnerize? 

“What about that flowerpot?” 
I asked. 

“It will be dropped on the cor- 
ner of Tenth Street and Mc- 
Adams Boulevard at eight-thirty 
tomorrow morning.” 

“Tenth and McAdams? 
Where’s that?” 

“In Jersey City,” he answered 
promptly. 

“But I’ve never been to Jersey 
City in my life! Why warn me 
about that?” 

“I don’t know where you will 
or won’t go,” the derg said. “I 
merely perceive dangers to you 
wherever they may occur.” 

“What should I do now?” 
“Anything you wish,” he told 
me. “Just lead your normal life.” 
Normal life. Hah! 

I T STARTED out well enough. 

I attended classes at Colum- 
bia, did homework, saw movies, 
went on dates, played table tennis 
and chess, all as before. At no 
time did I let on that I was under 



the direct protection of a vali- 
dusian derg. 

Once or twice a day, the derg 
would come to me. He would say 
something like, “Loose grating on 
West End Avenue between 66th 
and 67th Streets. Don’t walk on 
it.” 

And of course I wouldn’t. But 
someone else would. I often saw 
these items in the newspapers. 

Once I got used to it, it gave 
me quite a feeling of security. An 
alien was scurrying around twen- 
ty-four hours a day and all he 
wanted out of life was to protect 
me. A supernormal bodyguard! 
The thought gave me an enor- 
mous amount of confidence. 

My social life, during this peri- 
od, couldn’t have been improved 
upon. 

But the derg soon became over- 
zealous in my behalf. He began 
finding more and more dangers, 
most of which had no real bear- 
ing on my life in New York — 
things I should avoid in Mexico 
City, Toronto, Omaha, Papeete. 

I finally asked him if he was 
planning on reporting every po- 
tential danger on Earth. 

“These are the few, the very 
few, that you are or may be 
affected by,” he told me. 

“In Mexico City? And Pa- 
peete? Why not confine yourself 
to the local picture? Greater New 
York, say.” 

“Locale means nothing to me,” 



PROTECTION 



37 



the derg replied stubbornly. “My 
perceptions are temporal, not 
spatial. I must protect you from 
everything!" 

It was rather touching, in a 
way, and there was nothing I 
could do about it. I simply had to 
discard from hi^eports the vari- 
ous dangers in Hoboken, Thai- 
land, Kansas City, Angkor Vat 
(collapsing statue), Paris and 
Sarasota. Then I would reach the 
local stuff. I would ignore, for the 
most part, the dangers awaiting 
me in Queens, the Bronx, Staten 
Island and Brooklyn, and con- 
centrate on Manhattan. 

These were often worth wait- 
ing for, however. The derg saved 
me from some pretty nasty ex- 
periences — a holdup on Cathe- 
dral Parkway, for example, a 
teen-age mugging, a fire. 

T>UT HE kept stepping up the 
pace. It had started as a re- 
port or two a day. Within a 
month, he was warning me five 
or six times a day. And at last his 
warnings, local, national and in- 
ternational, flowed in a continual 
stream. 

I was facing too many dangers, 
beyond all reasonable probability. 
On a typical day: 

“Tainted food in Baker’s Cafe- 
teria. Don’t eat there tonight.” 
“Amsterdam Bus 312 has bad 
brakes. Don’t ride it.” 

“Mellen’s Tailor Shop has a 



leaking gas line. Explosion due. 
Better have your clothes dry- 
cleaned elsewhere.” 

“Rabid mongrel on the prowl 
between Riverside Drive and 
Central Park West. Take a taxi.” 
Soon I was spending most of 
my time not doing things, and 
avoiding places. Danger seemed 
to be lurking behind every lamp 
post, waiting for me. 

I suspected the derg of pad- 
ding his report. It seemed the 
only possible explanation. After 
all, I had lived this long before 
meeting him, with no supernor- 
mal assistance whatsoever, and 
had gotten by nicely. Why should 
the risks increase now? 

I asked him that one evening. 
“All my reports are perfectly 
genuine,” he said, obviously a 
little hurt. “If you don’t believe 
me, try turning on the lights in 
your psychology class tomorrow.” 
“Why?” 

“Defective wiring.” 

“I don’t doubt your warnings,” 
I assured him. “I just know that 
life was never this dangerous be- 
fore you came along.” 

“Of course it wasn’t. Surely 
you know that if you accept pro- 
tection, you must accept the 
drawbacks of protection as well.” 
“Drawbacks like what?” 

The derg hesitated. “Protection 
begets the need of further pro- 
tection. That is a universal con- 
stant.” 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Come again?” I asked in be- 
wilderment. 

“Before you met me, you were 
like everyone else and you ran 
such risks as your situation of- 
fered. But with my coming, your 
immediate environment has 
changed. And your position in it 
has changed, too.” 

“Changed? Why?” 

“Because it has me in it. To 
some extent now, you partake of 
my environment, just as I partake 
of yours. And, of course, it is well 
known that the avoidance of one 
danger opens the path to others.” 
“Are you trying to tell me,” I 
said, very slowly, “that my risks 
have increased because of your 
help?” 

“It was unavoidable,” he 
sighed. 

T COULD HAVE cheerfully 
strangled the derg at that mo- 
ment, if he hadn’t been invisible 
and impalpable. I had the angry 
feeling that I had been conned, 
taken by an extraterrestrial trick- 
ster. 

“All right,” I said, controlling 
myself. “Thanks for everything. 
See you on Mars or wherever you 
hang out.” 

“You don’t want any further 
protection?” I 

“You guessed it. Don’t slam the 
door on your way out.” 

“But what’s wrong?” The derg 
seemed genuinely puzzled. 



“There are increased risks in your 
life, true, but what of it? It is a 
glory and an honor to face danger 
and emerge victorious. The 
greater the peril, the greater the 
joy of evading it.” 

For the first time, I saw how 
alien this alien was. 

“Not for me,” I said. “Scram.” 
“Your risks have increased,” 
the derg argued, “but my capacity 
for detection is more than ample 
to cope with it. I am happy to 
cope with it! So it still represents 
a net gain in protection for you.” 
I shook my head. “I know what 
happens next. My risks just keep 
on increasing, don’t they?” 

“Not at all. As far as accidents 
are concerned, you have reached 
the quantitative limit.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“It means there will be no 
further increase in the number of 
accidents you must avoid.” 

“Good. Now will you please get 
the hell out of here?” 

“But I just explained — ” 

“Sure, no further increase, just 
more of the same. Look, if you 
leave me alone, my original en- 
vironment will return, won’t it? 
And, with it, my original risks?” 
“Eventually,” the derg agreed. 
“If you survive.” 

“I’ll take that chance.” 

The derg was silent for a time. 
Finally he said, “You can’t afford 
to send me away. Tomorrow — ” 
“Don’t tell me. I’ll avoid the 



PROTECTION

accidents on my own.” 

“I wasn’t thinking of accidents.” 

“What then?” 

“I hardly know how to tell 
you.” He sounded embarrassed. 
“I said there would be no further 
quantitative change. But I didn’t 
mention a qualitative change.” 

W/HAT are you talking 
^ about?” I shouted at him. 

“I’m trying to say,” the derg 
said, “that a gamper is after you.” 

“A what? What kind of a gag 
is this?” 

“A gamper is a creature from 
my environment. I suppose he 
was attracted by your increased 
potentiality for avoiding risk, due 
to my protection.” 

“To hell with the gamper and 
to hell with you.” 

“If he comes, try driving him 
off with mistletoe. Iron is often 
effective, if bonded to copper. 
Also — ” 

I threw myself on the bed and 
buried my head under the pillow. 
The derg took the hint. In a mo- 
ment, I could sense that he was 
gone. 

What an idiot I had been! We 
denizens of Earth have a com- 
mon vice: We take what we’re 
offered, whether we need it or 
not. 

You can get into a lot of 
trouble that way. 

But the derg was gone and the 
worst of my troubles were over. 



I’d sit tight for a while, give things 
a chance to work themselves out. 
In a few weeks, perhaps, I’d . 

There seemed to be a hum- 
ming in the air. 

I sat upright on the bed. One 
corner of the room was curiously 
dark and I could feel a cold 
breeze on my face. The hum 
grew louder — not really a hum, 
but laughter, low and monoton- 
ous. 

At that point, no one had to 
draw me a diagram. 

“Derg!” I screamed. “Get me 
out of this!” 

He was there. “Mistletoe! Just 
wave it at the gamper.” 

“Where in blazes would I get 
mistletoe?” 

“Iron and copper then!” 

I leaped to my desk, grabbed a 
copper paperweight and looked 
wildly for some iron to bond it 
to. The pap>erweight was pulled 
out of my hand. I caught it before 
it fell. Then I saw my fountain 
pen and brought the point against 
the paperweight. 

The darkness vanished. The 
cold disappeared. 

I guess I passed out. 

I ’> HE derg said triumphantly, 
an hour later, “You see? You 
need my protection.” 

“I suppose I do,” I answered 
dully. 

“You will need some things,” 
the derg said. “Wolfsbane, ama-

rinth, garlic, graveyard mold — ” 
“But the gamper is gone.” 
“Yes. However, the grailers re- 
main. And you need safeguards 
against the leeps, the feegs and 
the melgerizer.” 

So I wrote down his list of 
herbs, essences and specifics. I 
didn’t bother asking him about 
this link between sup>ernatural 
and supernormal. My comprehen- 
sion was now full and complete. 

Ghosts and spirits? Or extra- 
terrestrials? All the same, he said, 
and I saw what he meant. They 
leave us alone, for the most part. 
We are on different levels of per- 
ception, of existence, even. Until 
a human is foolish enough to at- 
tract attention to himself. 

Now I was in their game. Some 
wanted to kill me, some to pro- 
tect me, but none cared for me, 
not even the derg. They were in- 
terested solely in my value to the 
game, if that’s what it was. 

And the situation was my own 
fault. At the beginning, I had had 
the accumulated wisdom of the 
human race at my disposal, that 
tremendous racial hatred of 
witches and ghosts, the irrational 
fear of alien life. For my adven- 
ture has been played out a thou- 
sand times and the story is told 
again and again — how a man 
dabbles in strange arts and calls 
to himself a spirit. By so doing, 
he attracts attention to himself 
— the worst thing of all. 



So I was welded inseparably 
to the derg and the derg to me. 
Until yesterday, that is. Now I 
am on my own again. 

Things had been quiet for a 
few weeks. I had held off the 
feegs by the simple expedient of 
keeping my closet doors closed. 
The leeps were more menacing, 
but the eye of a toad seemed to 
stop them. And the melgerizer 
was dangerous only in the full of 
the Moon. 

“You are in danger,” the derg 
said yesterday. 

“Again?” I asked, yawning. 

“It is the thrang who pursues 
us.” 

“Us?” 

“Yes, myself as well as you, for 
even a derg must run risk and 
danger.” 

“Is this thrang particularly 
dangerous?” 

“Very.” 

“Well, what do I do? Snake- 
skin over the door? A p>entagon?” 

“None of those,” the derg said. 
“The thrang must be dealt with 
negatively, by the avoidance of 
certain actions.” 

T> Y NOW, there were so many 
restrictions on me, I didn’t 
think another would matter. 
“What shouldn’t I do?” 

“You must not lesnerize,” the 
derg said. 

“Lesnerize?” I frowned. “What’s 
that?” 



PROTECTION 



41 



“Surely you know. It is a 
simple, everyday human action.” 

“I probably know it under a 
different name. Explain.” 

“Very well. To lesnerize is to 
— ” He stopped abruptly. 

“What?” 

“It is here! The thrang!” 

I backed up against a wall. I 
thought I could detect a faint 
stirring of dust, but that might 
have been no more than over- 
wrought nerves. 

“Derg!” I shouted. “Where are 
you? What should I do?” 

I heard a shriek and the un- 
mistakable sound of jaws snap)- 
ping. 

The derg cried,' “It has me!” 

“What should I do?” I cried 
again. 

There was a horrible noise of 
teeth grinding. Very faintly, I 
heard the derg say, “Don’t tesner- 
ize!” 

And then there was silence. 

So I’m sitting tight now. 
There’ll be an airplane crash in 
Burma next week, but it shouldn’t 
affect me here in New York. And 
the feegs certainly can’t harm me. 
Not with all my closet doors 
closed. 

No, the problerri is lesnerizing. 
■I must not lesnerize. Absolutely 
not. If I can keep from lesneriz- 
ing, everything will pass and the 
chase will move elsewhere. It 
must! All I have to do is wait 
them out. 



The trouble is, I don’t have 
any idea what lesnerizing might 
be. A common human action, the 
derg had said. Well, for the time. 
I’m avoiding as many actions as 
possible. 

I’ve caught up on some back 
sleep and nothing happened, so 
that’s not lesnerizing. I went out 
and bought food, paid for it, 
cooked it, ate it. That wasn’t les- 
nerizing. I wrote this report. That 
wasn’t lesnerizing. 

I’ll come out of this yet. 

I’m going to catch a nap. I 
think I have a cold coming on. 
Now I have to sneez

By WILLY LEY 

LET'S BUILD 
AN EXTRATERRESTIAL! 

F or at least the last three 
decades, a large number of 
science fiction writers have 
been confronted, at one time or 
another, with the problem of con- 
structing extraterrestrial life- 
forms. Naturally the professional 
chemists and biologists who write 
science fiction on the side did 
best, not so much because their 
professional knowledge led them 
for long distances on hitherto un- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



43 




trodden paths, but because it 
made them stop at the right mo- 
ment. 

As regards those who were pri- 
marily writers, the results make 
one suspect that they at first tried 
to apply what biology they knew. 
Since this apparently did not get 
them very far, they presumably 
threw overboard whatever it was 
they had not quite arrived at and 
wrote things like this: “Surpris- 
ingly, the aliens were quite hu- 
man in shape, the only major dif- 
ferences, or at any event the ones 
which were easily visible, being a 
strong tail and a bluish com- 
plexion.” 

Or else, if the actual contact 
with the aliens could be fleeting, 
they resorted to saying that the 
forms the Earthmen beheld were 
so alien, so outside of all terres- 
trial experience, that it was im- 
possible to describe them. 

A LL this refers to recent sci- 
ence fiction, of course. Now 
let’s take a quick look back to the 
forerunners of modern science fic- 
tion and see whether they did 
any better. 

The first man who seriously at- 
tempted to think up life-forms of 
another heavenly body (the 
Moon, in this case) was the great 
Johannes Kepler, when wrestling 
with his book Somnium, which he 
never really finished. The plane- 
tary conditions he had in mind 

44 



consisted of a rocky surface with 
many caves, large and small, arid 
broiling sunshine through a thin 
atmosphere. Hence the creatures 
of the Moon mostly have the 
shape of terrestrial snakes, to be 
able to escape the deadly sun- 
shine quickly and thoroughly. 

Of the science fiction writers 
of the nineteenth century, I am 
selecting three and naturally the 
list has to be headed by Jules 
Verne. I think that I have read all 
of Verne and, unless a minor work 
escaped me, I can only report that 
he refrained- from building any 
extraterrestrials whatever. 

Jules Verne’s compatriot and 
contemporary Achille Eyraud (in 
his Voyage a Venus) and his Eng- 
lish contemporary Percy Greg (in 
his novel about a trip to Mars 
Across the Zodiac) were both 
proficient in describing pretty 
girls, but the only alien creature 
I remember is a flying snake in 
Greg’s book. 

As for Sydney Whiting’s Heli- 
onde: or, Adventures in the Sun, 
published in London in 1855, 
which is based on Sir William 
Herschel’s notion that the Sun is 
a dark body with a luminous at- 
mosphere, it can hardly be con- 
sidered science fiction. But even 
if it is, it does not offer much in 
the line of extraterrestrial crea- 
tures; a fairly typical example of 
the things you encounter is a bush 
which does not grow seed pods 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



but cakes of perfumed soap. 

Unlike Jules Verne, H. G. 
Wells went in quite heavily for 
extraterrestrials in his earlier 
years. When the engineer Cavor 
goes to the Moon, he finds gigan- 
tic moon calves and a ruling race 
modeled both in bodily and in 
social organization after the ants 
or termites of Earth. I think that 
Wells is the original inventor of 
the giant insects which have 
plagued science fiction editors 
ever since. But, as you also know, 
when Wells’ Martians come to 
Earth, they turn out to be air- 
breathing octopi in shape — not, as 
has been said on many occasions, 
a very likely -shape. 

'tF OWEVER, the occasional sci- 
-•■■■■ ence fiction writer of the 
past was not the only type of 
creative genius who did, or could 
have, exerted ingenuity in the 
building of an extraterrestrial. 
There were many others who en- 
gaged in a very similar line of 
endeavor for the purpose of rep- 
resenting gods, demons or just 
outlandish creatures, somewhat 
along the line of the Midnight 
Marvels to which I devoted a col- 
umn some months ago. 

To put it bluntly, nobody 
showed much imagination and the 
method was standardized at an 
early age: 

Combine the features of vari- 
ous kinds of living creatures into 



something that could be drawn, 
painted or sculptured and the job 
was done. Put a woman’s head on 
a feline body and you had a 
sphinx. Add the head of a bird to 
the body of a man and you had 
ibis-headed Thoth. Take a horse 
and supply it with the wings of 
an eagle and Pegasus was ready 
for flight, though with lateral sta- 
bility only. Take another horse, 
cut off its head and graft the 
upper half of a man’s body to it 
and the centaur was ready. 

Christianity brushed away these 
particular examples, but the 
method must have remained, for 
at one point St. Bernard had 
harsh words to say about decora- 
tions he encountered in monas- 
teries : 

“What business have those ri- 
diculous monstrosities, those 
amazingly freakish beauties' and 
marvelously beautiful freaks in 
the cloisters right in front of the 
eyes of the monks who are sup- 
posed to be reading or meditat- 
ing? You see one head with many 
bodies or one body with many 
heads. Here you have a serpent’s 
tail attached to a quadruped and 
there a mammal’s head attached 
to a fish’s body. There you have 
a creature that is half horse and 
half goat and here one with horns 
and the rear end of a horse.” 

Just what business such crea- 
tions had in a cloister is a still 
unanswered question, but artists

The Hydra which was removed from the 
Mediterranean landscape by Hercules 



just could not think of another 
method. 

The fabulous unicorn was 
drawn as a horse with the feet of 
a goat and a narwhale’s tusk on 
its forehead. The mermaid — a 



fairly late invention — was a 
woman from forehead to waist 
and a fish below that. (Virgil 
Partch, in a recent cartoon, put 
the left-over halves together as 
an alternate choice.) And the tra- 
ditional picture of the devil was 
that of a man with ’ two small 
goat’s horns, one goat leg and a 
tail. Demons differed from devils 
by having a few more incongru- 
ous parts added to an improbable 
anatomy. 

VEN when it came to some- 
thing as simple, compara- 
tively speaking, as the legendary 
Hydra, the extirpation of which 
was one of the feats of Hercules, 
the artists stuck to their formula. 




Flying snakes from Gesner 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 







The Forest Devil^ said to have been caught in Switzerland 



The story spoke of a seven- 
headed snake and this should not 
be a very hard task for an artist. 
What he did draw was the body 
of an exceedingly well-nourished 
snake with seven heads that 
might be described as humanized 
lion faces and with two, just two, 
lion paws with six toes. 

We do not know who made this 
drawing; it was preserved for us 
by Konrad Gesner in his Historia 
animalium with a warning that 
his readers should not take the 
Hydra to have been historical 
reality. But the same book con- 
tained “flying snakes,” since clas- 
sical authors had vouchsafed their 
existence. Some just had wings. 
Others had wings and feet. 

A far more complicated crea- 
ture was the Forest Devil, also 
from Gesner, an unclassified and 
unclassifiable beast caught just 



once in a Swiss forest. Here the 
artist went all out: the body is 
that of a mammal with a tail, the 
legs are human but with bird feet, 
the arms human with lion’s paws. 
The creature has a beard and the 
masculine article is used through- 
out in the description — but there 
are pronounced pendulous breasts. 

And then you had the really 
complicated creatures, the griffin, 
the dragon and the basilisk. In 
the case of the basilisk, the legend 
was definite on a few things: 
the basilisk was the king of the 
serpents and came into being 
when a seven-year-old rooster 
laid an egg which was hatched 
either by a toad or by the Sun. 
In appearance, then, it had to 
have both characteristics, those of 
serpents and those of the rooster. 

I offer two attempts to com- 
bine these characteristics. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



47 




Left: The grifFin, old German drawing 
Right; The dragon, from the same source 



The artist who drew the picture 
for Sebastian Munster’s Cosmo- 
graphia more or less settled for a 
lizard’s body with a long tail. The 
head — wearing a crown — was 
mostly that of a rooster and there 
were eight rooster’s feet, four on 
each side. 

The other picture (artist also 
unknown) is from an old German 
natural history book. In this de- 
sign, the rooster largely won out, 
except for the long reptilian tail 
and the wings, which are not bird 
wings. The griffin is a wild mix- 
ture of bird and mammal all the 
way through, while the dragon is, 
in this case, a comparatively tame 
creature. More often, it appeared 
as an enormous crocodile with 
gigantic bat wings. 

' I ■’HAT a random combination 
can do almost as well is 
proven by Fig. F, which is the 



outcome of a game my wife used 
to play with our two daughters. 
In that game, one of the three 
participants would start by draw- 
ing a head, which could be either 
human or animal. Then the head 
was folded under, leaving only 
the lines of the neck visible, and 
the next player could go on from 
there, knowing only that it was a 
neck. And so forth. 

In this particular case, result- 
ing in a bug-eyed monster which 
could quite easily have graced (if 
that’s the word) the cover of cer- 
tain magazines at a certain pe- 
riod, the daughter who drew the 
head obviously had some sort of 
fairy tale caterpillar in mind. The 
mind of the next player was on 
cats, but the first still stuck to 
caterpillars. The one who had cats 
in mind produced the skirt of 
which the hem remained visible, 
so that the dancer’s legs resulted.

So you obviously cannot pro- 
duce a biologically possible or 
even believable creature by the 
(random or artistic) combination 
of separate parts. Fine — but how 
can you go about it? All I can say 
offhand is that it isn’t easy; so 
much depends on so many differ- 
ent circumstances. 

There is, in the first place, the 
planetary environment, consisting 
of such factors as either much 
water or very little water; tem- 
perature which depends mainly 
but not only on the distance of 
the planet from its sun; seasonal 
changes which depend on the in- 
clination of the axis of rotation of 
a planet to the plane of its orbit 




Top: The bosilitic, 
from Munster's Cosmogrophio 
Bottom: The basilisk, 
hatched from a rooster's egg 




Not an extraterrestrial but the result of a 
game. Same method, though 

around the sun. 

It depends on the presence or 
absence of a large moon (or 
moons) because, with a large and 
nearby moon, you get pronounced 
tides, while without a moon, or 
only very small moons, you only 
have the solar tide, which is likely 
to be unimpressive. 

The relative abundance of the 
chemical elements in the outer 
crust and in the atmosphere cer- 
tainly also plays a role. 

L et us, for a first test, take our 
two neighbors in the Solar 
System, Venus inside the Earth’s 
orbit and Mars outside it.

When I started reading books 
on science, as a schoolboy, Venus, 
in most of them, was firmly de- 
clared to be a panthalassa, the 
technical term for a planet com- 
pletely covered by water without 
any land showing. This, after va- 
rious attempts to be “different,” 
has recently been revived by 
Whipple and Menzel as the most 
likely concept. 

Now such a shoreless ocean — 
I am avoiding all other considera- 
tion and am concentrating on just 
the one fact that it is an ocean — 
can harbor virtually everything 
in abundance. But with limita- 
tions; you can’t just mix the fauna 
of the equatorial Pacific Ocean of 
today with equatorial seas of the 
Jurassic and Cretaceous periods 
and obtain a believable or even 
possible picture. 

You can have, if you want to, 
most of the arthropods, lobsters 
and sea spiders, trilobites and, if 
you insist, something like a sea- 
going centipede. But you must 
specify that there are shallow 
areas in this ocean if you want to 
have clams, for they don’t grow 
too far down. You can have jelly- 
fish in fantastic numbers of spe- 
cies as well as individuals. 

You can have octopi and all 
sorts of fishes. But you can’t have 
a turtle, for example, because 
when, in Earth’s past, some fishes 
went up on land, they first pro- 
duced what we now call amphibia 



— say, primitive salamanders — 
and the reptiles, the birds and the 
mammals came afterward. They 
all are creatures of the land, even 
though some reptiles, like the tur- 
tles and the sea snakes, and some 
mammals, like the whales and the 
seals, returned to the ocean at a 
later date. 

And don’t make anything more 
intelligent than the most intelli- 
gent fish — I don’t know which fish 
that is or could be — for the open 
sea is a region of steady move- 
ment and no intelligence is 
needed for that. The exceptions 
to the statement that this is a 
region of movement are armored 
forms like clams, but a perfectly 
sessile creature which relies on its 
armor for individual protection 
and on numerous offspring for 
survival of the species also is not 
going to develop intelligence. It 
doesn’t need any. 

So a shoreless Venusian ocean 

— I repeat I am concentrating on 
no other fact than that it is a 
shoreless ocean — might harbor a 
very varied life and some forms 
may be rather pretty. But I chal- 
lenge anybody to think up an 
aquatic form of life, especially 
among the invertebrates, which 
would look radically different 
from what we have in our oceans. 
The multitude of forms on our 
own planet is so overwhelming 
that one always gets the impres- 
sion that anything that can sur- 



50 



GALAXY SCtENCE FtCTtON 



vive with the shape it has is also 
in existence. 

O NE thing is absolutely needed 
in this shoreless ocean if it 
is to have any life at all. There 
must be plants, microscopic or 
otherwise, because animal life 
alone is an impossibility. 

You know the old tall tale 
about the man who made a living 
by having a mouse and cat farm. 
The cats, of course, ate the mice, 
and when the cats were big 
enough, he killed and skinned 
them, sold the pelts and fed the 
cat’s bodies to the mice. Even if 
the mice were carnivorous, this 
just wouldn’t work. Somewhere at 
the beginning of such a cycle, 
there has to be the original food 
producer, the plant, which makes 
living (and edible, as a rule) tis- 
sue out of dissolved minerals, car- 
bon dioxide and sunlight for 
energy. 

I might as well, at this point, 
present two strong hints at cau- 
tion. If, in that sea, you have a 
tribe of Kraken, octopi a mile in 
circumference and the largest 
thing in the ocean, don’t make 
them smart. If they are the larg- 
est thing in the ocean, immune to 
all danger except an occasional 
outburst of the elements, such as 
a submarine volcano opening up, 
and, of course, old age, they don’t 
have to be intelligent. What has 
been said about oysters a while 



ago applies also to the invulner- 
able life-form. 

Likewise, don’t make some- 
thing one millimeter in diameter 
into an intelligent life-form. Some 
time ago, somebody wrote a story 
in which the main character, who 
was not a hero, caught what he 
thought to be a shiny wasp. It 
stung him so hard that he had to 
let go — and then noticed to his 
surprise that the wasp sting made 
his Geiger counter chatter wildly. 
The implication was, of course, 
that this was a tiny spaceship 
with atomic drive. 

Though I liked the story, I 
knew that this could never hap- 
pen. In order to be intelligent 
enough to even discover atomic 
energy, a being has to have a 
rather large number of brain cells. 
These brain cells must be nour- 
ished, which needs organs for eat- 
ing and digesting food. The diges- 
tive tract must be protected by 
some covering and this package 
must be moved around in some 
manner so that it can find food. 
It must also move around to 
avoid being eaten, at least until 
it has attained the intelligence 
that splits atoms and controls 
what they do after splitting. 

T T has been said and bolstered 
with many pounds of statistics 
that, in a modern army, 98 men 
are needed to ehable two men to 
shoot at the enemy. This relation-

ship must apply also to the num- 
ber of cells needed to support the 
brain cells that do the thinking. 
Since a cell, in order to function 
as a cell, must consist of a very 
large number of molecules and 
since the size of molecules is a 
given fact, there must be a mini- 
mum size for a functioning cell. 

L. Sprague de Camp, who was 
to my knowledge the first to pre- 
sent this chain of reasoning (in 
a two-part article in Astounding, 
May and June issues of 1939), 
came to the conclusion that an 
overall body weight of around 40 
pounds would be needed if you 
want intelligence on the human 
level. 

It is possible that a few facts 
permit a little more stretching, so 
that the minimum weight could 
be less. But the reasoning itself is 
valid and the reduction cannot be 
very much. Whether the first in- 
terstellar hero has to establish re- 
lations with something weighing 
45 or only 30 pounds does not 
make much of a difference. 

But I did not want to slip out 
of our solar system yet. 

Now if we look at Mars, we are 
helped no end by the fact that 
we know a great deal about it. 
Here is a small planet with very 
little water and a thin atmosphere 
consisting mostly of inert nitro- 
gen. It is generally a cold planet, 
but during the summer the equa- 
torial regions can attain tempera- 



tures between 60 and 70 degrees 
Fahrenheit at noon. To make our 
problem still easier, we are virtu- 
ally certain that we see plant life. 

The dark greenish patches 
which all bear nice classical 
names due to Signor Schiaparelli 
of half a century ago cannot just 
be mineral discolorations. When 
covered up by yellow dust from 
the deserts, they manage to break 
through again and just during the 
last close approach of Mars, in 
1954, Dr. Earl C. Slipher, working 
at Bloemfontein, South Africa, 
found a new one almost the size 
of Texas under about 15° north- 
ern Martian latitude and about 
235° Martian longitude, which 
means about halfway between the 
northern end of Syrtis major and 
T rivium Charontis, two well- 
known Martian markings. 

' I ■'HERE has been a lot of dis- 
cussion recently in learned 
journals on whether any terres- 
trial plant could grow on Mars, 
and if so, which one. Naturally 
any suggestion made by anybody 
was countered with heavy argu- 
ments by somebody else. But the 
fact remains that we see some- 
thing growing on Mars which is, 
in our terminology, plant life. If 
we do not understand their bio- 
chemistry under the conditions 
we are forced to assume from as- 
tronomical observations, this can 
only mean one of two things: 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Either we cannot observe all 
the conditions and something 
which we have missed, or are 
bound to miss with present instru- 
mentation, is a perfectly fine ex- 
planation; or else we don’t know 
enough biochemistry and there is 
a way of living and growing un- 
der these conditions. 

The reasoning that forced us 
to say that there must be plant 
life in the Venusian oceans, if 
we want animal life of any kind, 
almost forces us to say that, since 
there are plants on Mars, there 
must be something that we would 
call animals. 

Some biologists with whom I 
discussed this stated with profes- 
sional caution that this reasoning 
does not necessarily hold true. I 
don’t agree. Speaking in the larg- 
est sense, the animals of Earth, 
from sow bugs to elephants, are 
parasitic on plants. Now life, at 
least on Earth, behaves in such 
a manner that if there is some- 
thing to be parasitic on, some- 
thing else will be happy to take 
over the role of the parasite. 

Something feeding on these 
Martian plants must have the 
power of movement because it 
needs so much plant tissue for its 
own sustenance that the rate of 
the plant growth cannpt furnish 
the necessary amount. Hence it 
must be capable of locomotion. 

Whether this supposed Martian 
plant-eater is built along the lines 
/ 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



of a locust, or along the lines of 
a desert tortoise, or along those 
of a rabbit is something entirely 
different again. One can assume 
that it simply freezes into a death- 
like state during the cold Martian 
rlight and remains in that state 
until thawed out by the Sun. In. 
that case, it could be insectlike in 
organization. 

One can assume with equal jus- 
tification that the “animal,” at the 
first sign of cold in the evening, 
burrows into the ground for a few 
feet and goes to sleep normally in 
an environment where the tem- 
perature may be quite cold, but 
where there is very little devia- 
tion from whatever temperature 
it may have. Iri that case, it could 
be something comparable to a 
desert tortoise. 

Or you can make the assump- 
tion that it has an internal 
mechanism like the birds and 
mammals of Earth, something 
producing heat. Then it does not 
have to dig itself in. All it needs 
is an effective heat insulator 
around its body, which might be 
hairlike, or featherlike,' or, if this 
sounds more “alien,” something 
like bark or sponge rubber. 

Co far, I have mostly talked 
about extraterrestrial animal 
life in order to show some of the 
difficulties. When it comes to an 
extraterrestrial intelligent life- 
form, the difficulties rapidly in- 

53 



crease in number and kind. 

It may come as a surprise, but 
the first tentative recipe for the 
construction of an intelligent ex- 
traterrestrial was written by the 
Dutch physicist, philosopher and 
astronomer Christian Huyghens. 
The title of the book is Kosmo- 
theoros and it appeared posthu- 
mously, in 1692, at first in Latin. 
Nobody seems to know just ^hen 
Huyghens wrote the major por- 
tion of the book. 

He said there that an extrater- 
restrial must have eyes and ears 
— that is, senses “and pleasure 
arising from his senses.” He must 
know the art of writing to remem- 
, ber things, arithmetic and geom- 
etry to understand relationships, 
hands to make things — and he 
must be upright. 

It does not become quite clear 
from Huyghens’ book why he 
must be upright. It sounds as if 
Huyghens made this condition to 
free the forelimbs from the task 
of locomotion so that there are 
“hands to make things.” 

The insistence struck me as 
amusing because Sprague de 
Camp, in the articles mentioned, 
also was insistent on that point, 
but more for mechanical reasons. 
The brain must be protected 
against shock as much as possible 
and the more bone, cartilage and 
tissue there is between the feet, 
which take the shocks, and the 
brain, the better. 



All this is sound logic and it is 
obvious that the body of the ex- 
traterrestrial must be such that it 
functioned well as an animal body 
before it grew to be intelligent. 
Of course, one can p>ostulate that 
accidental enviromental condi- 
tions of the past helped along. 

Around the turn of the century, 
a number of biologists and zoolo- 
gists toyed with the idea that 
Man had evolved in what they 
called an asylum, an area acci- 
dentally free from large preda- 
tory animals and with a gentle 
climate. They obviously did not 
think much of the human body as 
a well-functioning animal. We 
now know that they were wrong 
and that the idea of the “asylum” 
is not needed. But it may con- 
ceivably have happened some- 
where else, for the Galaxy must 
be full of planets and possibilities. 

' I ■’HERE is just one major diffi- 
culty in imagining a believ- 
able intelligent extraterrestrial — 
we have never seen one. What I 
mean by this remark is this: 

We know the organization of 
living animal tissue on Earth. We 
know that the organization of the 
mammal is superior. True, it 
“wastes” food by making its own 
heat, but this fact makes it cli- 
matically independent. And 
though a reptile can do quite well 
in the proper climate, it is very 
limited. When the air grows too 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cold, it must be inactive, though 
it usually survives. When the air 
grows too hot, it dies of heat 
stroke, for, lacking a temperature- 
regulating mechanism, it not only 
cannot keep warm, it also cannot 
keep cool. 

Now this vertebrate body, 
whether mammalian or reptilian, 
has two pairs of limbs and usually 
a tail. What we don’t know is 
Whether it has to be built that 
way. 

To use a classical example: we 
don’t know whether the centaur 
shape is possible or not. On Earth, 
it doesn’t exist; that much is cer- 
tain. But is this due to an ana- 
tomical necessity for which we 



don’t know the reason or did it 
just happen that way here? 

As for comparatively minor 
matters, we do know that they 
just happened. Genus Homo is 
tailless and almost hairless. But 
it doesn’t have to be hairless and 
tailless to invent writing, to build 
and ride cars and to engage in re- 
search, politics and crime. 

If we had fur and a tail, our 
fashions, habits and morals would 
be different, but if brain and 
senses and hands were unchanged, 
we’d still write books and sym- 
phonies, build houses, ships and 
airplanes — and try to build an 
extraterrestrial.

ALLECK, for Pete’s

as if you were ready to 
attack Donner with your bare

search Foundation removed an 
expensive cigar from its plastic 
cocoon and lit it from young Tap- 



lin’s eagerly offered lighter. 

Halleck sat down. “Sorry, G. W. 
This business has me on edge. I 
feel responsible for Donner’s ac- 
tivities— and for the missing 
$300,000, too. The whole thing 
reeks of larceny.” 

“You are responsible, Hal.” The

president’s tone was crisp but not 
accusing. “That’s what a general 
manager gets paid for. Isn’t it 
time Donner showed up?” 

“He’s to be here at ten, Mr. 
Caples. The girl will buzz us as 
soon as he comes in.” Orville Tap- 
lin was a very good secretary, but 



his eagerness to prove it some- 
times irked his superiors. “Shall I 
order some coffee sent up, Mr. 
Caples?” 

“Not just now. Look, Hal, have 
you checked on this Simon Kane 
that Donner mentions in his let- 
ter? He doesn’t sound quite real. 



POINT OF DEPARTURE 



57 



Do we know if there is such a 
person?” 

Taplin interrupted the general 
manager to answer the question. 
“Yes, sir. There really is a Simon 
Kane. I talked to Dr. Reed by 
transatlantic telephone last night. 
He said Kane was public relations 
man on his first expedition to 
Egypt in 1958.” 

“Why the blazes didn’t you let 
me talk to him?” Halleck was on 
his feet again, a sharp-faced, bald- 
ing man with a temper that sug- 
gested ulcers. “G. W., I—” 

“Forget it, Hal! What else, 
young man?” 

“Well, Dr. Reed said he fired 
him at the request of the Egyp- 
tian government and sent him 
back to the States. He said it was 
a long story and he didn’t want to 
get into it on the phone.” 

T EANING across the wide ma- 
^ hogany desk and tapping the 
blotter for emphasis, Halleck said, 
“Look, G. W., Kane doesn’t mat- 
ter. He’s just a name. The Utah 
Flats plant is short $300,000. Let 
Donner explain it in court. If 
Kane or anyone else was in- 
volved, let Donner prove it.” 

The buzzer wheezed and Or- 
ville Taplin’s finger shot to the 
key. “Yes?” 

“Mr. Donner is here.” 

G. W. Caples nodded to the 
question in the secretary’s face. 
“Send him in.” 

58 



The man in the doorway was 
tall, sandy and rather stooped for 
early middle age. His straight 
lined features looked competent, 
but the mouth was compressed to 
a narrow hyphen, as if he had 
lived through this ordeal many 
times in anticipation and always 
come out of it badly. His gray 
business suit was wrinkled with 
travel. 

“Gftod morning, Mr. Caples. 
Gentlemen.” 

Although he closed the door 
gently, the click of it sounded 
loud in the silence. “I hope I’m 
not late.” 

“Right on the dot, Ray. Glad to 
see you. Pick a comfortable chair.” 
The president smoothed the 
crumpled letter in front of him on 
the desk and waved the silent 
Halleck to a seat. “You can order 
that coffee now, young man.” 

When Taplin had called for the 
coffee and started the recording 
machine, G. W. Caples addressed 
the newcomer again with heavy, 
executive affability. It was au- 
thentic enough to ease the watch- 
spring tension in the room. 

“Before we start, Ray, keep it 
in mind that this isn’t a trial or 
anything like that. I, for one, have 
an open mind. If your record 
hadn’t been beyond reproach, you 
wouldn’t be a research plant man- 
ager in the first place.” 

“Thank you.” 

“But your letter here mentions 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



an unauthorized experiment that 
cost $300,000, a missing man — 
two missing men, in fact — your 
fear of ugly publicity and — well, 
various other details that leave 
me thoroughly confused. Now, 
you’re going to give us all the 
facts — not as a culprit, but as a 
trusted official.” 

“I appreciate that, sir. Shall I 
begin at the beginning?” 

“Yes. Forget the letter. Begin 
where you like.” 

“Well, first, you know Dr. Wil- 
son Reed, the archeologist. Top 
man in the field. He made the 
Yucatan discoveries and located 
the Poseidon Tablets in the vaults 
under the Sphinx — the newspa- 
pers called him the ‘Columbus of 
the Past.’ But I don’t need to tell 
you that. This all began with a 
letter I had from Dr. Reed shortly 
after he left for his second expe- 
dition to Egypt.” 

C APLES nodded. “I know his 
reputation, but I never met 
the man.” 

“That’s one of the many things 
I don,’t understand, Mr. Caples.” 
Raymond Donner sat on the edge 
of the leather lounge chair and 
kneaded his long, thin hands. 
“You see, the letter asked me to 
cooperate with Simon Kane in 
every way and there was an inter- 
office memo from you enclosed, 
instructing me to do so, written in 
your own handwriting.” 

POINT OF DEPARTURE 



Caples leaned across the desk, 
startled. “A memo from me! Now 
see here, Ray — Where is the 
memo? Where’s the letter?” 

“They’re gone, Mr. Caples. 
They were stolen.” 

The buzzer sounded and a 
cheerful redhead brought in a 
tray with four cups, cream and 
sugar bowls and a large aluminum 
coffee urn. It remained untouched 
on the desk when she had gone. 

“I see. They were stolen.” The 
president’s casual manner was 
gone and the tension returned un- 
checked. “Go on.” 

“I’m sorry, sir. But the letter 
and memo were the keys to the 
whole business. And I want to re- 
mind you at the beginning that 
I’m not a scientist or an aviation 
engineer, but an administrative 
officer — ” 

“Maybe we should say you 
were." 

“Shut up, Halleck! Let him go 
on.” 

The president glanced at the 
recorder spinning silently and 
drew short, angry puffs on his 
cigar. 

“And I want to remind you, 
too, gentlemen, that I'm here of 
my own volition. My fears are 
for the Foundation’s reputation, 
not for myself alone. After all, 
there’s no motive for murder 
and — ” 

“Murder!” The two executives 
looked frozen. Taplin, starting to 

59 



reach for the coffee, changed his 
mind. 

and, to put it bluntly, no 
dead body. But let me take it 
from the beginning.” 

A S I said, the letter and memo 
came in May, just after Dr. 
Reed left for Egypt again. A 
week after that, Simon Kane 
phoned from Salt Lake City to 
make an appointment for the fol- 
lowing afternoon. 

He turned out to be a dark- 
featured, very distinguished type 
in his late forties. His eyes were 
an intense black, heavily browed 
and, though he wasn’t big, his 
voice was deep and arrestingly 
modulated. Listening to him, it 
was easy to lose track of what he 
was saying. His mouth was wide 
and — well, sympathetic. 

We talked for about an hour 
that first day, mostly about Dr. 
Reed’s marvelous discovery in 
Egypt. Kane said the Poseidon 
Tablets described a magnificent 
civilization, scientifically ad- 
vanced, that had flourished on an 
equatorial continent until it was 
destroyed by the Biblical Flood 
— around 10,700 B.C. 

He spoke of Dr. Reed as an in- 
timate friend and said he had 
been greatly impressed with you, 
Mr. Caples. 

THE PRESIDENT scowled. 
“I’ve never heard of the man. 



But it seems pretty strange that 
he should have turned up when 
Halleck was in Persia and I was 
in Europe on atomic-inspection 
duty and Reed was off to Egypt.” 

“Looking back at it, I agree 
with you,” said Donner, taking 
out a cigarette and lighting it. 
“But it didn’t occur to me at the 
time.” 

“Well, get on with it.” 

IF I COULD give you a bet- 
ter idea of Kane’s remarkable 
voice, its hypnotic quality — but I 
guess I can’t. Maybe that’s just 
an excuse. I wish I’d thrown him 
out of the office the first day. 

When we got around to the 
reason for his call, he asked if 
there was any chance of our be- 
ing ^overheard. I assured him 
there wasn’t and he told me his 
weird story. 

It seemed Dr. Reed had found 
another series of fourteen tablets 
along with the others, but these 
hadn’t been publicized. A trans- 
lation of the first half dozen 
showed that they concerned an 
outstanding — perhaps the ulti- 
mate — scientific achievement of 
the Poseidon civilization: a small 
solar energy converter, able to 
deliver such fantastic power that 
it made our nuclear sources look 
as primitive as the windmill. 

When I said the invention 
wouldn’t be very welcome “"in a 
country where the entire econ- 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



omy was geared to atomic power, 
Kane agreed and said that ex- 
plained the secrecy. He said you, 
Mr. Caples, and Dr. Reed felt the 
device should be tested under 
wraps and then turned over to 
the government, since private 
ownership of a dirt-cheap power 
source — if it worked — might pre- 
cipitate economic chaos. 

G . W. CAPLES sat stiffly in 
the same position. “The 
whole idea is pure nonsense, the 
most transparent fraud. A child 
wouldn’t swallow it.” 

“You may be right. It was my 
misfortune not to be a child.” 

SIMON KANE made it sound 
completely plausible. He said 
two good men could build the 
gadget in a month. He agreed to 
bring the specifications to my 
office the next morning and I 
showed him out, feeling very ex- 
cited about the thing. I had a lot 
to learn about Mr. Kane. 

In the morning, I called in 
Ruhl and Heiniger and told them 
they were to work on a project 
involving 100% security. They 
agreed, of course. The hush-Kush 
jobs are usually the most inter- 
esting. Then Kane came in with 
his sheets of specifications and 
gave them the details. Their faces 
were — I was going to say like 
children viewing their first 
Christmas tree. 



Since it was all Greek to me, I 
left the three of them to discuss 
the project and went off about 
some other business. Kane was 
gone when I got back and had 
left a note inviting me out to his 
house for a cocktail or two that 
afternoon. 

When I could get away, I drove 
out to his place, a great, sprawling 
ranchhouse he’d rented a few 
miles from the plant. No one else 
was there, but Kane was an in- 
gratiating host and a couple of 
hours passed very pleasantly. I 
kept wgndering why he wanted 
such a big place, way out in the 
hills, just for himself. 

Around five, I phoned Ruhl at 
the plant. He’s rather a stolid 
type ordinarily, but he was stut- 
tering with excitement. He said 
the power unit was revolutionary 
and might change the course of 
history. 

Kane laughed when I repeated 
that to him. “Maybe it already 
did,” he said. “A few thousand 
years ago.” 

We shook hands at the door 
and agreed to meet the next 
morning and get to work. 

As I was walking along the 
house toward the drive where my 
car stood, a movement at one of 
the windows near the end of the 
building caught my eye. I paused 
and looked up — into the face of 
one of the most beautiful women 
I’ve ever seen. 



POINT OF DEPARTURE 



61 




She was youngish, not over 27 
or 28, pale in coloring with rich, 
black hair piled up behind her 
neck. The large, dark eyes were 
looking squarely into mine. I 
must have stopped and stared for 
several seconds, for, in addition 
to her beauty, I thought I saw a 
great dread written in the girl’s 
face. Then she was gone. 

All the way home, I kept won- 
dering why Simon Kane hadn’t 
mentioned the woman in his 
house. The silly thought that she 
was being held captive there kept 
coming to me, no matter how of- 
ten I dismissed it. 



^APLES poured a cup of cof- 
fee and made a face when he 
sipped it. “Donner, I don’t know 
why you have to ornament this 
yarn with hypnotic-voiced vil- 
lains and captive girls. Can’t you 
just tell us if your expensive 
gadget worked?” 

Halleck slumped glumly. Tap- 
lin fluttered over the cold coffee 
and ordered some more. 



THE DEVICE did work, Mr. 
Caples. I set Ruhl and Heini- 
ger up in the isolated shop at the 
west corner of the plant area and 
they had it functioning in three 
weeks. We brought in a skilled 
glass-cutter to form the big, fac- 
eted eye to receive the Sun’s ra- 
diations. Naturally, he didn’t 
know what it was for. 



By the time the eye was ready, 
they’d assembled the conversion 
elements. They rigged the thing 
to deliver electrical current 
through a series of step-down 
transformers. The result was ap- 
palling. Until the current was re- 
duced to a tiny 'fraction of the 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




potential, it blew out every test- 
ing gauge they plugged into it. 

Up to this time, I think all 
three of us — Heiniger, Ruhl and 
myself — had been kept hopped 
up by curiosity and Kane’s infec- 
tious confidence. Now it was evi- 
dent that something incredible 
had been produced. Think of it — 



two men could lift the converter 
between them, yet its potential 
was as great as any atomic pile 
we have! 

“IT SOUNDS crazy.” Caples 
was getting restless. “Are you 
sure you didn’t dream all this, 
Donner?” 



POINT OF DEPARTURE 



63 



“That story will sound great in 
court — but it doesn’t account for 
the $300,000.” Halleck’s laugh 
was thin, with no amusement in 
it. 

The buzzer sounded. “Here’s 
your hot coffee, Mr. Caples,” said 
Taplin. When the girl had gone 
again, Donner continued pa- 
tiently, speaking in Halleck’s di- 
rection without anger. 

SO FAR, we had spent less 
than three thousand dollars, 
including salaries, materials, 
overhead, everything. The ex- 
periment seemed to be finished. I 
wrote up my report and showed 
it to Kane before filing it in the 
project folder with Reed’s letter 
and the memo and everything 
else concerned. I supposed Kane 
would be bn his way east and I’d 
be expected to verify his state- 
ment of the results. But he didn’t 
come in to say good-by . 

One morning, I stopped in at 
the isolated shop and found 
Heiniger still working with the 
power unit. Naturally, I asked 
what he was doing. 

“Getting it ready to mount in 
the projectile, Mr. Donner,” he 
said. 

I said, “What projectile?” 

' I ' HEN he explained how Kane 
(and I) had leased a surplus 
one-man rocket from the White 
Sands Project and that he and 

64 



Ruhl were to rig the solar unit in 
it. Rather than let Heiniger know 
something was wrong, though I 
felt like blowing my top, I asked 
him how on E^rth an electrical 
plant could power a rocket. 

“There’s nothing to it,” he said. 
“It’s all in Mr. Kane’s transla- 
tions of those tablets of his.” 

I was beginning to wonder if 
this was really happening or if I 
was dreaming. Heiniger described 
some sort of method for setting 
up a magnetic field in front of 
the rocket so that it could be 
pulled, rather than pushed, at al- 
most any speed through the at- 
mosphere that the pilot wished — 
five, ten, twelve thousand miles 
an hour — whatever the pilot 
could take. 

It was hard to believe an ex- 
perienced man like Heiniger 
would swallow that. I said, “It’s 
ridiculous! The skin would melt!” 

“Oh, no,” said Heiniger. “Mr. 
Kane has the formula for an al- 
loy that won’t melt at any speed 
in atmosphere. His tablets tell 
how it was used way back there 
for the same kind of flight. He’s 
having a special sheath of it 
made for the rocket in Santa Fe.” 

PRESIDENT CAPLES stab- 
bed his cigar into the ashtray. 
“Donner,” he said, “what do you 
take us for? You’re making it 
almost impossible for the Foun- 
dation to back you up, coming in 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



here with such a fairy story.” 

Raymond Donner seemed to 
shrink in his clothes and he 
slumped deep in his chair. “I 
know how it sounds. I’m a fool — 
I admit it. But Heiniger isn’t, nor 
Ruhl. They were convinced they 
were working on the modern 
world’s first practical spaceship.” 

T LEFT the plant with my head 
■*- spinning and drove out to Si- 
mon Kane’s place. I was deter- 
mined not to go any farther with 
this without authority from you, 
even if I had to chase you all 
over Europe. 

, When I reached the house, 
Kane’s car was in the driveway. 
He met me on the patio and 
pushed me inside before I could 
say my piece. There was a young 
man in the drawing room whom 
he introduced as Porter Hays. He 
was a handsome chap in his mid- 
dle twenties with cropped, blond 
hair and an engaging candor 
about him. I guessed he was a 
flier by the recklessness about 
his mouth and eyes. He seemed 
very excited. 

They took me to a table spread 
with photographs and typed 
sheets and, for the first time, I 
saw pictures of the original tab- 
lets. The typed sheets were trans- 
lations. 

“Porter has agreed to fly the 
ship,” said Kane, as if I knew all 
about that. “He’s with the Pan- 



Columbian Project and has flown 
all the other types that have been 
developed so far.” 

“But this is the one that will 
make history, Mr. Donner!” I 
looked at Hays closely and saw 
that he meant it. “This will fly 
anywhere in our solar system — 
and probably clear out to most 
others — without carrying a fuel 
supply. And the best thing about 
it is the absolute guarantee of a 
return trip. Those geniuses down 
at Pan-Columbia have plenty of 
ideas for getting you out there, 
but very few for getting you 
back.” 

I realized the Simon Kane 
magic had been at work on the 
young man. He was sold com- 
pletely and — considering the pos- 
sibilities and that he was willing 
to risk his life on them — the ob- 
jections I intended to make 
seemed rather puny at the time. 
Still, I was about to ask Kaue to 
see me in private when the young 
pilot spoke up. 

He said, “Say, Mr. Kane, 
where’s the last tablet? There 
are only photos of thirteen here.” 

“Why, that’s right,” Kane said. 
“I forgot to mention it. The first 
thirteen take us through the con- 
struction of the unit and the ship 
and the inventor’s successful trial 
flights. Number fourteen hasn’t 
been translated yet — it takes 
about a month to decipher each 
tablet.”

Porter Hays had a disarming 
way of asking anything he wanted 
to know. “And who does it? Do 
you, Mr. Kane?” 

“No. That is, it’s a special gift, 
takes years of study — ” 

“Then who does decipher 
them?” 

“Well, you see—” It was the 
first time I’d seen Simon Kane 
uneasy and at a loss for words. 
“My wife does it. She’s Egyptian, 
a scholar in her own right, daugh- 
ter of one of Egypt’s foremost 
antiquarians.” 

XT AYS insisted upon meeting 
her and, although Kane 
tried every evasion, he finally left 
the room and was gone quite a 
while. During the wait, I talked 
with young Hays and confirmed 
my high opinion of him. I won- 
dered how he’d react to Mrs. 
Kane if she turned out to be the 
beautiful girl I’d seen in the win- 
dow a few weeks earlier. 

I soon found out, for Kane 
came back leading the girl by the 
hand. I might have said “drag- 
ging,” but it wasn’t quite that ob- 
vious. At closer view, wearing a 
sort of chiton-draped white dress, 
she was even more lovely than 
I’d thought. The long lashes 
veiled her eyes, except when she 
acknowledged Kane’s introduc- 
tions with a quick glance and a 
murmured, “How do you do.” Her 
name was Nalja. 

66 



Hays was obviously impressed 
and, in his uninhibited way, said, 
“Good Lord, Kane! If I had a 
dream like this at home, I 
wouldn’t hide her. I’d keep her 
out on display to make the other 
guys jealous.” 

The girl gave him a grateful 
look and just a flicker of a smile, 
but said nothing. 

Simon Kane’s reaction was cu- 
rious. The color drained from his 
face and hostile was the only 
word for his expression. Then he 
seemed to get under control and 
became his genial self. “My dear,” 
he said to his wife, “we thought 
you could give a hint about the 
text of the fourteenth tablet. Are 
you far enough along?” 

Her voice was low and throaty, 
with a slight British accent. “I’m 
sorry. I have only just started.” 

“Have you no idea what it’s 
about?” 

“Only that it seems to be some 
sort of testimonial. The language 
symbols are a little different than 
the others and it’s difficult to 
read.” 

Then she was gone and Porler 
Hays stood looking at the door 
through which she had passed, as 
if he had just seen a vision. 

^fYEYAIT a minute, Donner,” 
” Caples cut in. “How’s that 
tape holding out, young man?” 

“Fine, Mr. Caples. At least an 
hour more to go.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“All right. Go ahead, Donner. 
Can’t you leave out some of the 
side issues and get to the finish of 
this?” 

“They’re all related to the out- 
come of the matter, Mr. Caples. 
It wouldn’t make any sense at all 
without them.” 

“Nor with them,” said Halleck 
sourly, staring out the window. 

KANE WAS to drive Hays 
back to Salt Lake, so I only 
had a moment alone with him. 
When I told him I wanted to hold 
up everything until I’d checked 
with my superiors, he just 
laughed it off. He said that you, 
Mr. Caples, had seen all thirteen 
translations and your memo cov- 
ered the whole works. I’m sorry 
to say this convinced me. 

Next day, a carload of equip- 
ment came in for testing and I 
didn’t see Simon Kane for about 
a week, though I* learned things 
weren’t going so well. There was 
seme trouble with the alloy. The 
rccket was shipped in, though, 
and turned out to be a very recent 
model with the latest develop- 
ments in shock and pressure com- 
pensation, oxygen plant, homing- 
beam navigation and all that. The 
credit to White Sands was only 
$32,000, including insurance, so I 
authorized it without misgivings, 
figuring that the persuasive Kane 
had swung a good deal. 

Ruhl got back from Santa Fe 



and said they’d licked the alloy 
problem, though it had been hard 
to avoid publicity. The metal 
could only be worked in a molten 
state, so the fabricator was casting 
the nose sheath and three over- 
lapping girdles with rivet holes, 
also rivets and fin shields of the 
same stuff. It sounded heavy to 
me, but Ruhl said that would 
eliminate all possibility of vibra- 
tion. This metal casting ac- 
counted for most of the $300,000. 

During the next two weeks, I 
was too busy with other things 
to worry much about the project, 
but two incidents happened that 
had a bearing on it. 

On a visit to Salt Lake, I was 
dining at the Pioneer Arms one 
evening and spotted Porter Hays 
at a table across the room. He 
was with a young lady who 
looked familiar to me, even from 
the back. They were deep in con- 
versation. Hays looked up and 
saw me just as the waiter brought 
my dinner. His expression was far 
from friendly. When the waiter 
moved out of the way, I looked 
over and saw that Hays and the 
girl were gone. 

A little later, a bellboy brought 
me a note. It read, “I expect you’ll 
be guided by your own ideas of 
honor in a case like this. But if 
you can conscientiously keep your 
goddam mouth shut, you may 
help to correct a great injustice. 
Hays.”

APLES had joined Halleck at 
the window. Now he inter- 
rupted. “I suppose this note and 
the bill of lading on the rocket 
were stolen, too?” 

“I tore up that note myself, Mr. 
Caples. The bill of lading, though 

— the second incident concerns it.” 

Young Taplin had begun to 

fidget. 

ON JULY 19, Kane telephoned 
and said the airship was all 
rigged and ready to go. He had 
chosen a spot in the desert for the 
test and had scheduled it for the 
next morning. He’d engaged an 
expert communications man — a 
friend of Ruhl’s — and the ship 
and all ground equipment were 
loaded on a trailer under canvas, 
ready to leave at nightfall. Ruhl, 
Heiniger and the radio man 
would ride out there together in 
the trailer. 

I was irked not to have been 
consulted on the arrangements. 
Kane wanted me to pick up Por- 
ter Hays and follow the trailer 
out, saying he’d be delayed, but 
would be there at dawn. I told 
him I had an appointment for 
dinner — some government brass 

— but would be there in time for 
the test. 

Kane seemed to become furi- 
ous at this. He railed about the 
lack of cooperation and how he’d 
had to work out the details of the 
project almost single-handed, in 

68 



spite of a clear directive from my 
superiors. It ended by my hang- 
ing up on him. 

Driving home around eleven 
that night, I passed the plant and 
noticed a light burning in the 
darkened office building. Before 
I reached the gate, it struck me 
that the light was from my own 
office. The guard at the gate had 
just come on duty, but his clip- 
board had no incoming signatures 
on it. So I went to take a look. I 
turned the knob of my office door 
and Kane was standing by the 
desk with his briefcase in one 
hand and his hat in the other. 

I was shocked at the change in 
him. His eyes were sunken and 
deeply rimmed with shadow. He 
looked ten years older than the 
last time I’d seen him. 

But he wasn’t at all abashed. 
He walked around the desk and 
took my hand, saying, “Raymond, 
I’ve been waiting here an hour. 
Felt sure you’d stop by. Wanted 
to apologize in private for my 
disgraceful performance this af- 
ternoon.” 

Kane must have seen I wasn’t 
satisfied. “The strain of this un- 
dertaking has been greater than 
you realize,” he added. “So much 
is at stake, such a great respon- 
sibility to Dr. Reed, your founda- 
tion, the whole world — ” 

I mumbled something about 
forget it and told him to come 
along to my place for a bracer 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and we’d ride out to the site to- 
gether. But he said he had a cou- 
ple of matters to attend to and 
we parted at the plant gate. 

¥T ALLECK came back and sat 
■*■■■- down. Caples took his seat 
at the desk. “I have a feeling,” he 
said, “that we are about to learn 
if this prehistoric spaceship of 
yours ever got off the ground.” 
“Shall I order some more cof- 
fee, Mr. Caples?” asked Taplin 
eagerly. 

“No. Just shut up, you idiotl 
Are you too young to appreciate 
this breathless, undocumented 
melodrama Mr. Donner’s describ- 
ing for us? This last incident ex- 
plains the lack of documentation, 
doesn’t it, Donner?” 

“I’m afraid it does. I discovered 
later that the folder with all the 
papers relating to the project was 
missing from my files, but I have 
other evidence to offer — a wit- 
ness.” He glanced at his wrist- 
watch. “If my witness is prompt. 
I’ll just have time to finish this.” 
“Please do! Does the next scene 
take place at the launching site?” 

YES. I GOT there a little late 
— missed the turn off the high- 
way and went a long way past it. 
When I found the place, every- 
thing was ready and they were 
waiting for me. 

The aircraft lay on its side, 
looking fat and very ungainly, I 

POINT OF DEPARTURE 



thought, because of its increased 
girth. Porter Hays seemed tense, 
but eager to get on with it. He 
wore no flight garb except his 
helmet with the earphones. Stand- 
ing there in slacks and sweater, 
smoking a final cigarette, he didn’t 
look theatrical enough for such 
an occasion. I thought of telling 
him I’d kept my goddam mouth 
shut, but didn’t get a chance. 

The plan was to take the ship 
up a few hundred feet and jockey 
around to test everything. If the 
equipment and ship were all right. 
Hays would whip her up a few 
hundred miles and cruise at his 
discretion. There was to be no 
long flight that day. Since we 
were far out of the traffic lanes, 
we didn’t expect to attract any 
attention. 

At last the Sun came up full, 
there was a final conference, and 
Hays climbed into the ship’s ro- 
tating cabin by the door at the 
rear. He waved and shut the door. 
He could see out with his tele- 
view, of course, but we couldn’t 
see him. 

While the radio man checked 
the ship-to-ground contact, the 
rest of us moved back out of 
habit, though there would be no 
blast here. 

"^ERY slowly, the ship raised 
^ itself to a vertical position. It 
rose gradually to about ten feet, 
stopped, then shot up a couple of 

69 



hundred and stopped again. It 
was incredible! 

“Give me the phone,” said 
Kane. He was as white as paste 
and his eyes were fever-bright. 
“How’s it doing, Hays? Looked 
good from here. Is she p>owering 
right?” 

The answer must have been 
gratifying because Simon Kane’s 
white teeth flashed when he heard 
it. 

After that, the ship bobbed 
around in swift dashes, stopping, 
then darting upward till it was 
only a dot, reaching unbelievable 
speeds. All this time, Kane was 
talking with Hays on the phone, 
asking questions, suggesting new 
maneuvers. Though he was trem- 
bling with excitement, his voice 
was calm, controlled and persua- 
sive. I realized later that he was 
egging Hays on to try more and 
more spectacular tests of the ship. 

Suddenly it shot away in a 
steep climb toward the west and 
was out of sight in a matter of 
seconds. Kane laid down the tele- 
phone and turned to me. 

“He’s satisfied the craft works 
perfectly,” he said. “He’s going to 
take it straight out for four or 
five hours and then come back.” 

We all stared at him, for Hays 
wasn’t to have stayed up over an 
hour. I said, “He can’t do that. 
There’s too mhch he doesn’t know 
about the ship. Tell him to come 
back!” 



Kane didn’t look at me. “The 
boy knows his business. Leave 
him alone. He’s making history.” 
“But the first time — ” 

“I’m going down the road a few 
miles to get some breakfast. Take 
turns talking to him, why don’t 
you?” 

He got in his car and drove off. 

XIT the villain! Donner, 
^ you’ve got a talent, but 
you’re in the wrong line of work.” 
G. W. Caples dug a chubby fore- 
finger under his collar and worked 
the tie knot loose. “This scenario 
is worth every single cent of 
$ 300 , 000 .” 

Raymond Donner’s mouth 
pressed a little tighter and his 
tongue pushed through to moisten 
his gray dry lips. 

“He never came back,” he said 
hoarsely. “And neither did Hays.” 
Something in the man’s voice 
stopped the president from going 
on with his sarcastic attack. 

“Did the ship crash?” he asked 
more soberly. 

“No. It just flew away and 
never came back.” 

The silence hung like a shroud. 
All three of them — even the self- 
conscious Taplin — stared at Don- 
ner. 

“We talked to Porter Hays in 
turns. We begged him to come 
back. But he just laughed and 
said he was having the ride of his 
life. After about two hours, his 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



voice faded out suddenly — and 
that was the end of it.” 

“How long ago was this?” 
“Four days.” 

“Have you notified the authori- 
ties, the police or — well, anyone?” 
“No. I’ve been putting it off. 
You see. Hays gave us no hint of 
any trouble. The others are still 
sitting out there in the desert 
waiting for him, trying to make 
radio contact. The ship carried a 
standard survival kit with seven 
days’ rations and water. If he’s 
had no operational trouble. Hays 
could stay out at least a week.” 
"And what about Simon 
Kane?” demanded Caples. 

VI^HEN Kane didn’t come back 
” by noon, I went to look for 
him. 

On the way to his home, I 
stopped at the office, on a hunch, 
and discovered the records were 
missing. At last it began to pene- 
trate that there was something 
rotten in Denmark. 

Dusk had fallen and there were 
no lights in the Kane house when 
I got there. No one answered the 
doorbell. I called and pounded 
and finally climbed in a window 
to look for signs that the Kanes 
had packed and left. There were 
none. Everything was in order. 

Then, as I was leaving, I heard 
a knocking sound from the end of 
the building and traced it to the 
last room on the west side, a sort 



of study. The knocking came from 
a locked closet. The key was gone, 
so I had to smash the door. 

Nalja Kane was sitting on the 
floor, staring at me without seem- 
ing to see me. She looked fright- 
ful, with her hair awry and her 
eyes red and glassy. 

She sort of moaned as I helped 
her up. “Did it happen? Did he 
fly the ship?” 

I said, “Yes, but something’s 
wrong. Where is your husband?” 

The girl seemed to go all to 
pieces, turning her head from side 
to side and repeating, “Oh, no! Oh, 
no!” Then she collapsed. 

I drove her to the hotel in the 
nearest town and called a doctor 
I knew. He said she had emo- 
tional exhaustion, needed rest 
rather than hospital care, and 
gave her a strong sedative. When 
I got home, I stayed awake long 
enough to write that letter to you 
and then fell into bed. 

The phone woke me around 
ten the next morning. It was Ruhl, 
calling from a gas station on the 
highway. He said Hays wasn’t 
back yet and promised to call 
again at five. 

I mulled the whole thing over 
all day, trying to sort out the 
facts, but they just wouldn’t add 
up to anything. When Ruhl called 
again with the same bad news, I 
decided to come on east and get 
it off my chest. It’s all beyond 
me. I don’t know what to do.

rk ONNER searched in his pock- 
ets and pulled out a cigarette 
pack. It was empty and he crum- 
pled it absently. Halleck patted 
his own pockets but couldn’t find 
any. 

“Now take it easy, Ray,” said 
Caples, walking around the desk 
with the humidor and holding it 
open. “This is the weirdest thing 
I’ve ever heard — yet I think I be- 
lieve you. Leave it to you solid 
types to foul up on a grand scale! 
How about this witness you men- 
tioned?” 

“On the train — I wanted more 
time to think, so I didn’t fly here 
— it occurred to me how flimsy 
this would all sound, without your 
memo or anything else to back it 
up. I couldn’t even prove the tab- 
lets ever existed. In Chicago, I 
phoned Nalja Kane. She was 
much better and quite calm. 
When I told her the spot I was 
in, she agreed to take a plane in 
the morning and try to be here 
a*t 11:30 today.” 

Taplin’s finger darted to the 
key panel, but Caples brushed 
him aside and opened the circuit 
himself. “This is Mr. Caples. Is 
there a lady in the outer office?” 
“Yes, sir. Mrs. Simon Kane.” 
“Ask her to step in, please.” 
The four men rose before the 
door opened — Donner, slowly, 
with great weariness. She stood a 
moment, looking from one face to 
another, cool and regal in sum-

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




mer white with a small flowered 
hat. Faint purple circles gave her 
black eyes a brilliance. 

Raymond Donner took her 
hand and led her to a chair. 
“Thank you for coming, Mrs. 
Kane. May I present Mr. Caples 
and Mr. Halleck, my superiors — 
and Mr. Taplin.” 

When they were seated, she 
spoke first in her low, passionate 
voice, without waiting for ques- 
tions. “I will tell you what I know 
of Simon Kane, gentlemen, 
though it may be less than you 
would expect from a wife. In re- 
turn, I ask you to use all your in- 
fluence to find him and bring him 
to justice. He is a monster and a 
murderer!” 

“You have my word on it, Mrs. 
Kane,” said Caples, “if you can 
supply the evidence that crimes 
have been committed. Taplin — 
the recorder. Move it closer.” 

As she began to speak, an oc- 
casional small break in her voice 
hinted at the emotional turbu- 
lence the girl was holding in tight 
rein. 

1 MARRIED Simon Kane in 
Egypt in 1958. We met 
through my father, who repre- 
sented the Egyptian government 
on Dr. Reed’s excavation project. 
At first, Simon was charming and 
devoted. We left Egypt almost at 
once and entered upon a very 
pleasant, if secluded, life in this 



POINT OF DEPARTURE 



73 



country. The only discordant note 
was my father’s obvious dislike 
for Simon. His letters were stiff 
and infrequent, and finally stopped 
altogether. 

One day, after we had lived 
here about three years, my hus- 
band brought home two heavy 
cases and called me in when he 
opened them. These cases con- 
tained the fourteen tablets that 
Mr. Donner has probably men- 
tioned. Simon told me Dr. Reed 
had turned them over to him to 
be deciphered. 

I knew at once that this was 
not true, since Dr. Reed is one of 
the world’s foremost students of 
ancient writings and would have 
prized the tablets too highly to 
let my husband carry them 
around in his car. When Simon 
asked me to make the transla- 
tions, I refused. 

He became nearly insane with 
rage and finally told me he had 
persuaded my father to help him 
steal them a few weeks before our 
wedding. If I did not agree to 
translate them, he threatened to 
expose my father and disgrace 
him before the world. So I did as 
Simon demanded and it killed my 
love for him. 

In his twisted, possessive way, 
I think my husband continued to 
love me. Once the translation was 
under way, he tried very hard to 
win my voluntary cooperation. 
He said the device described in 



the tablets would upset the econ- 
omy of the entire world. The gov- 
ernment and industry, he claimed, 
would pay any price he asked for 
suppressing it, once it was tested 
and proved. We would live like 
royalty. But I told him that, if 
not for my father, I would expose 
him without the least hesitation. 

When we moved to Utah, Si- 
mon found an isolated house for 
us and I was virtually a prisoner. 

TVALJA KANE stopped. The 
' danger signals of emotion 
breaking through showed in the 
swift, anxious breathing. The four 
men studied her helplessly and 
then it was Taplin who got the 
glass of water that bridged a dif- 
ficult moment. She went on. 

“The first day you came to our 
house, Mr. Donner, I wrote a note 
of warning. I intended to hand it 
to you through the window, but 
Simon came into the room behind 
me and I couldn’t.” 

“I’m so sorry, Mrs. Kane. You 
were obviously in trouble. I should 
have — ” 

“Perhaps it was better. It might 
have cost you your life to cross 
Simon at that point.” 

ANYWAY, PORTER HAYS 
stopped by one day. My hus- 
oand was out and I answered the 
door. He was a fine man, sensitive 
and kind, considering his adven- 
turous temperament. He could 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



see I was nervous — you know the 
disarming way he had of asking 
the most personal questions. 

I was afraid to talk there and 
asked him to drive me to Salt 
Lake. On the way, I told him the 
whole story. He was very sympa- 
thetic and promised to help — be- 
ginning by trying to contact my 
father. I hoped he would refuse to 
fly the ship when he knew about 
Simon. But he had absolute confi- 
dence in it and no fear at all. His 
plan was to complete the test and 
then ask you, Mr. Donner, to im- 
pound the ship and all the records 
on it. 

The day before the test flight, 
I put in the time completing the 
translation of the fourteenth tab- 
let. 

Simon had shown no interest 
in this, believing it to be a sum- 
mary of the others. As the sense 
of it began to emerge, I was hor- 
rified. By midnight, I had fin- 
ished it and I sat down in the 
drawing room with a typed copy 
in my hand, waiting for my hus- 
band. I waited all night and must 
have fallen asleep around dawn. 

The door chime wakened me. 
It was a messenger with a note 
from Porter — Mr. Hays. A news- 
paper friend of his in Cairo had 
been checking and discovered 
that my father had been dead six 
months. The circumstances of his 
death were curious and Mr. Hays 
suggested contacting the Cairo 



police as soon as the flight was 
over. 

This news was a terrible blow, 
but the moment I read it, I was 
free of Simon Kane. I went to the 
phone and asked the operator for 
the police. While I was waiting 
for the connection, there was a 
slight sound behind me. I turned 
and Simon was crossing the room. 
He was in his dressing gown. He 
must have .come in while I was 
dozing. I ran for the door, but he 
caught me and pushed me into a 
chair. 

Vj^HEN he had hung up the 
” phone, he read Mr. Hays’ 
note without saying a word. His 
face was terrible and I knew I 
was in danger. Then I saw that 
the typed copy of the fourteenth 
tablet was gone. 

“You read it — the last tablet,” 
I said. “And you know you’ve 
done all this evil for nothing. The 
flight can’t take place. If you — if 
you stop me from telling the po- 
lice, Porter will tell- them. He 
knows everything.” 

He took my wrist and dragged 
me to the studio and forced me 
into the closet and locked the 
door. I could hear him crumpling 
and burning papers for a long 
time. 

At last he came close to the 
door and said, “There, my dear! 
Try to prove that the tablets ever 
existed!” 



POINT OF DEPARTURE 



75 



When he was gone, I screamed 
and pounded on the door until I 
was exhausted. A frightful thing 
was going to happen and there 
was nothing I could do to stop it. 

Only once — only one time 
since this all began have I op>- 
posed my husband successfully. 
And it had no effect on the out- 
come. When I typed up the text 
of the last tablet, I made a carbon 
copy and put it in my handbag. I 
have it here. I believe it will be 
evidence enough to prove that Si- 
mon Kane is a murderer. 

NALJA KANE reached in her 
flat beaded bag and found a 
folded sheet, which she handed 
to Donner. He smoothed it on his 
knees with hands that trembled a 
little. 

“May he read it aloud, Mrs. 
Kane?” asked Caples. 

“Certainly, if he wishes. But the 
first part is technical data on a 
flight by an inventor named Ax- 
tel. The two last paragraphs con- 
tain the evidence I am offering 
you.” 

"TkONNER nodded and ran his 
■*-' finger down the sheet. He 
read: 



“The foregoing record is ac- 
curate and we acknowledge Ax- 
tel’s superlative contribution to 
science. But we must admit that 
his greatest contribution is in the 
proving of an axiom: Where ulti- 
mate force is involved, it is better 
to know none of the laws than to 
know most of them. 

“ ‘On the fourth day, the air- 
craft returned from far space to 
the point of its departure. It was 
in excellent condition — but 
empty. Nothing remained of Ax- 
tel but merely his clothing and 
his ring.’ ” 

Nalja Kane covered her face 
with both hands and sobbed noise- 
lessly. 

The four men all gazed at the 
paper as it rustled in Donner’s 
quivering hand. 

Presently the buzzer ripped 
the silence like the tearing of a 
shroud. 

After the second sharp buzz, G. 
W. Caples tripped the switch and 
croaked, “Yes?” 

The girl’s voice, bright and 
businesslike, answered, “There’s a 
long-distance call from Utah for 
Mr. Donner. It’s a Mr. Ruhl. He 
says it’s urgent.”

Garrity's 

Annuities 

By DAVID MASON 



every planet is badly in need 
of family men, naturally— but 
the same one on all of them? 



Y OU might say Garrity 
brought it on himself. The 
way I put it, Garrity was 
the architect of his own disasters. 
It’s a nicely put phrase, I think. 
Anyway, a lot of people tried to 
tell him what might happen. I 
did, for one, though I’d never 
have thought it would happen in 
just that way. What I would have 
predicted for Garrity would be 
trouble, but just ordinary trou- 
ble: jail, or getting his Space En-

gineer’s ticket suspended, or 
something like that. Not the kind 
of trouble he’s got. 

I remember distinctly the first 
time I heard Garrity explaining 
his theory. It wasn’t a new theory, 
but the way Garrity talked about 
it, you’d think he’d invented it 
personally. We were sitting in the 
messroom in the Aloha — that 
was the old Aloha, the one that 
belonged to the Muller Space 
Lines. Talking about women —

trip like that. 

Neither Garrity nor I had ever 
touched down on Seranis, which 
was where we’d be in another 
week or so. The other off-watch 
man, Gloster, had been there sev- 
eral times and liked the place. 

“A lot of Earthside Oriental in 
’em,” Gloster said. “They’re little 
brown characters, real obliging. 
The girls especially. You just 
treat ’em polite and they’ll treat 
you right back.” 

“Uh-huh,” I said, considering 
the idea. 

^ ARRITY curled his long lip. 

“It’ll cost you just as much in 
the end. Women are always look- 
ing for something.” 

“Not this kind on Seranis,” 
Gloster said. “Best port I’ve ever 
been in. I’m staying on the Aloha 
till I get to putting curtains on 
my cabin port.” 

Garrity shook his head. He 
looked as cynical as he could, for 
his age, which was twenty-four. 
We were all of us fresh out of 
Lunar, with the ink hardly dry on 
our Engineer tickets. 

“I’ll tell you,” said Garrity. “I 
haven’t seen a woman yet that 
wouldn’t cost you more than she 
was worth in the long run.” 
“Long run?” I asked him. “We 
don’t spend more than a few days 
down on Seranis. Isn’t going to be 
any long run. If she runs, let her 



to catch her before takeoff time.” 

Gloster chuckled, but Garrity 
just looked righteous. 

“You’ll see what I mean,” he 
told us. 

“Yeah,” Gloster said. “I guess 
you and me will go downtown 
and pick up a couple girls and 
take in some high-priced amuse- 
ments, like listening to records at 
the Spaceman’s Union Lounge. 
After which we hurl our hard- 
earned cash away on a quart of 
pink arrack and we take the girls 
home with it. In the morning, we 
haven’t got a credit left, so we 
blast off with nothing but a set 
of beautiful memories.” Gloster 
crowed. “What’s the matter, any- 
way, Garrity? The Union gets us 
the best wage scale in any space 
fleet and you still think girls cost 
too much? Even the Seranese?” 

Garrity kept on looking wise. 
“I’m not kidding. I’ve seen a lot 
of men come up to retirement 
without a credit put away. Half- 
pay and nothing else, all because 
they spent everything having a 
good time.” 

“You can do without women, 
maybe?” I asked. 

“No,” Garrity admitted. “I’m a 
normal man.” 

“Yeah,” said Gloster, very flat. 

Garrity looked peeved. “Well, 
I am. But I’m careful, too. I fig- 
ured it all out a long time back. 
I aim to have everything you

guys look for and not go to half 
the trouble and expense.” 

“What did you figure out?” 
“I’m going to get married.” 
Gloster and I just sat there, 
looking at each other. After a 
while, Gloster finished his coffee 
in silence. He got up, looked at 
Garrity, shook his head sadly, and 
went out. 

T T took me a while to finish 
-*■ looking Garrity over, myself. 
When I managed to get my voice 
under control, I asked him what 
he was talking about. 

“I saw what happened to my 
old man,” Garrity told me. “When 
he came up for retirement, he was 
broke. He doesn’t complain, but 
he never has anything left out of 
his retirement pay. Spends his 
time loafing around and writing 
his memoirs. It was women, 
mostly; after he lost my mother 
— she died when I was born — he 
went off to space again. Sent back 
enough tc keep me, spent the rest 
in one port or another.” 

I didn’t say anything, but it was 
beginning to add up. I don’t know 
anything about psychology, but I 
thought there might be something 
like a reason in what Garrity was 
telling me for the way Garrity 
was. Somewhere he’d got the idea 
that his old man wasn’t happy. I 
doubted it, because I’ve seen and 
talked to lots of old retired hands. 
Most of them had a good life be- 

<0 



hind them and they were still en- 
joying the taste of it 

But I didn’t argue with Garrity 
about it. I’ve got more sense. 
When a man’s got a pet notion, 
leave it alone. You won’t pry him 
off it and you might get him mad 
at you. A spaceship’s too small to 
make enemies in. 

“Suppose you get married,” I 
asked him. “So you have a place 
to go, and a girl in it, in one port. 
How about all the others? Going 
to take a permanent port watch 
instead of seeing a little fun?” 
“Easy,” Garrity said. “I’ll just 
get married in all of them.” 

“All of them?’ 

“Well, the ones I’m in most 
often. Terra City, Chafanor, some 
other places. I’m thinking of 
homesteading on one line as soon 
as I pad on a little seniority.” 
The notion did have a certain 
cold practicality about it. I didn’t 
like it, but as far as getting away 
with it went, he could. 

Garrity went on to explain a bit 
more; his system seemed to have 
been worked out to the last detail. 
He’d set up two, three, maybe 
fcur or five happy little house- 
holds, spend his end-of-run leave 
in each, dividing up his time nice 
and even. All of them together 
wouldn’t cost him what a night or 
two on the town might. 

To add to that, he’d pick out 
his wives with care. They’d all be 
different in a lot of ways, for the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sake of variety, but they’d all be 
affectionate, home-loving girls, 
and careful with money. They’d 
save his credits for him. And 
when he retired, he could keep 
active and happy visiting them 
and his various families, which he 
expected to include a real lot of 
kids and grandchildren. 

“I don’t believe in small fami- 
lies,” he explained. 

A t the time, I never thought 
he’d try to carry it through. 
I’ve heard wild ideas in mess- 
rooms before, particularly half- 
way through a long trip. They 
usually fade out when a man 
gets his feet down on gravity 
again. This one didn’t. 

But it might have worked out, 
at that. It was just Garrity’s luck 
that he signed on the Brooklyn. 

The Brooklyn carried ore from 
Serco to Terra, and Terran ma- 
chinery back to Serco, a regular, 
steady, run. When I bumped into 
Garrity in the hiring hall, he told 
me he’d just signed on her, and I 
told him I had, too. Naturally, I 
asked him how the Garrity old- 
age-insurance system was working 
out. 

‘"Well,” he confessed, “I’m not 
married yet. But I’ve got a likely 
girl here in Terra City. All I've 
got to do is ask her. Now if I can 
line one up in Serco — ” 

“In Serco?” I turned a little 
pale, I think. “Listen, Garrity, 



have you ever been in Serco?” 
“No. Why? Aren’t they hu- 
manoids?” 

“Oh, sure.” I was trying to think 
just how you'^d describe Serco and 
its peculiar people. “Only differ- 
ent.” 

“How’re they different?” 
Looking at that stubborn mug 
of his, I knew I wasn’t going to be 
able to explain this in a million 
years. It was just no use. Garrity 
had everything all figured out. 
But I took one try. 

“They’ve never been much of a 
mechanical culture; they buy all 
their stuff from outside, in ex- 
change for ore and timber. But 
they’re one of the pldest civiliza- 
tions in the Galaxy. They’ve spent 
a million years learning about 
minds and thoughts, all that phi- 
losophy sort of thing. I don’t 
mean they aren’t perfectly all 
right. They’re human, but they 
know a lot. It wouldn’t pay to 
fool around with them.” 

Garrity laughed. “Maybe they 
might read my mind?” 

I knew it was no use. I just 
shrugged, bought Garrity a beer 
to celebrate, and we headed for 
the spaceport. 

No, the Sercoans don’t read 
minds. At least, I don’t think they 
do, though there are times when 
they’re that clever at adding you 
up that you’d think they were 
looking at your thoughts. 

Garrity didn't get caught that 



GARRITY'S ANNUITIES 



81 



way. He got caught because he 
couldn’t keep from telling the rest 
of us about his great idea. One of 
the navigators, a man named 
Lane, was the one who told Katha 
about it. 

T ANE was in love with Katha, 
naturally. Everybody was. 
She' worked in the port medical 
office and she was one of the rea- 
sons «jthy it tSok a high-seniority 
caird 'td 'sign on a ship for Serco. 
There were a lot of men who’d 
take dn extra set of immane shots 
just to have Katha give it to 
them'. And it isn’t a bit easy to 
figure out why. 

She wasn’t any beauty. Good- 
looking, sort of, but not especially 
so; 'a tallish girl, with gray eyes 
and a^ long, narrow, sensitive face. 
Browny-red hair that always 
looked a little carelessly cut. As 
I said, nothing at all special. It 
was just something about her. She 
could have had her pick and she 
picked Garrity. And only Lane 
broke the rules and told her. 
Trouble is, he told her a couple 
of weeks too late. 

It was because Lane had never 
thought that Katha would fall for 
Garrity that he hadn’t told .'her 
before. Bui: when he touched 
down at Serco port and heard that 
Katha and Garrity had gotten 
married the week before, he didn’t 
waste any more time. He called 
Katha up from the spaceport, and 



told her all about the Garrity 
plan, and how she was only the 
first, but definitely not the last. 

Lane told me afterward what 
Katha had said. 

“I am not jealous,” she’d an- 
swered. “If he had wanted Others 
when he was away, he could have 
done as he wished; as a man 
might. But he has spoken- to you 
as a child, not a man. I do not like 
that.” ' 

She didn’t sound terribly angry. 
It was the way she phrased it that 
bothered Lane.' 

“But he is not a bad man,” she 
said thoughtfully to ‘Lane. “And 
he is a good" lover and makes a 
fine husband. Twill nOt hurt him, 
but I think I will" give him some- 
thing which will teach him, if he 
wants to learn. And when he has 
learned, T will take it away again 
and he may be as free as he can 
. as free as any of you of the 
outside ever are.” 

I can’t tell you what it was she 
did. Neither can Garrity. Hell, he 
didn’t even know she’d done any- 
thing! He kissed her good-by at 
the port gates and went on' his 
way, and she went back to work 
in the pprt medical office. As far 
as any of us could see, the Garrity 
plan was well under way. 

I T wasn’t six months before I 
saw the thing starting off. That 
was when I was invited to Gar- 
rity’s second wedding. It was in 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Terra City, and when he asked 
me to come down with him for a 
witness, I assumed it would be 
the girl he had been busily court- 
ing before he went to Serco. But 
when I walked into the marriage 
regis'try office and took a look at 
the girl, I got a clear, horrific idea 
of just what Katha had done to 
Garrity. 

He didn’t think anything had 
been done to him. He .was all 
smiles. He brought the girl toward 
me, proud and possessive, grin- 
ning all over his face. 

“This is Mary Collins,” he told 
me, and I kept on looking, not 
saying anything. She smiled, and 
shook hands, and I could tell by 
her expression that she knew ex- 
actly what I was thinking. 

Unfortunately, I couldn’t say a 
word about it to Garrity. There 
was always the faint possibility 
that I might be wrong, in which 
case I could make a lot of trouble 
by saying a few words. The words 
were there, though, straining to 
get out. When he said, “Mary Col- 
lins,” what I wanted to say was, 
“No, it isn’t. It’s Katha.” 

' Because it was. After I watched 
the girl long enough, all the way 
through the marriage ceremony, 
then down in the elevator and out 
into the street, I became dead cer- 
tain. 

There was a brown mole on 
Katha’s arrn. Mary had it, too. 
And there was a look about the 

GARRITY'S ANNUITIES 



eyes — well, there could only be 
one Katha. 

What I could not understand 
was why Garrity didn’t see it. Af- 
ter all, he’d been married to 
Katha. 

But when tried to say some- 
thing to him, he brushed it off. 

“Sure, Mary looks a little like 
Katha,” he agreed with me. “But 
there are all kinds of small differ- 
ences. Things a man finds out as 
he goes along. Look, I’m very fond 
of both of them. I know the differ- 
ence. You’re just confused by the 
slight resemblance.” 

The clincher was the problem 
of how Katha had reached Terra 
City ahead of Garrity, to begin 
with, and whether there was still 
a Katha in Serco. I asked a man 
off a ship fresh from Serco and 
he told me Katha hadn’t been 
there for some time. No one knew 
where she’d gone, but she had said 
she’d be back. 

So Mary could be Katha, given 
a fast passenger ship. 

And Arnel could be Katha, too. 
Arnel had a mole in the right 
place. So did Lillian. And Ruth. 
And Virginia. 

"VT'ES, Garrity married every one 
of them. Six girls, six planets. 
It took him a while, and by the 
time he got as far as Ruth, he 
was going to a lot of trouble to 
arrange his shipping runs so he 
could make the full circuit. But 



83 



every so often I’d hear from him, 
or run into him, and there would 
always be a new one. 

The Garrity plan was going 
fine, but it lacked that one in- 
gredient he had counted on — va- 
riety. Every one o( those girls was 
Katha. 

He didn’t think so. He could 
call off the differences between 
them by the hour. To listen to 
him, if you hadn’t actually seen 
them, you’d have believed every 
word he said. 

Each one of them gets a share 
of Garrity’s pay — a big share, 
from the looks of it. Each one of 
them keeps a nice place for Gar- 
rity and, when he comes into port, 
he eats and sleeps as well as any 
honest groundwalker. And each 
one of them has a small fat baby 



boy, of whose exact age Garrity 
never seems to be quite sure. Two 
or three of the kids seem ex- 
tremely advanced for their ages 
and they were all born fairly close 
together, which was enough to 
make Garrity as proud as a roos- 
ter. 

And Garrity seems to be the 
only one who can’t tell. 

Thinking about it might make 
a man want to rush off to Serco 
and find a girl like Katha . and 
Serco is full of them. I’d like hav- 
ing a girl like Katha. I’d like hav- 
ing six Kathas even better. 

But I’m not going to. 

I won’t drive myself batty try- 
ing to figure out how she’d be 
keeping me fooled. 

And especially why.

THE GIRLS FROM PLANET 5 
by Richard Wilson. Ballantine 
Books, 35c 

T DID not find this book hilari- 
-*■ ous. I merely found it fresh, 
fascinating and vastly amusing. 
Wilson does a takeoff on The 
Warriot’s Husband that should 
end all Amazon stories, if we’re 
lucky. 

The gals have taken over the 
U. S. by the end of the century 
and have everything running like 
housework — oops! — clockwork. 
The only place fitten fer a real 
man is (where else?) Texas. 



When a feller’s had enough of 
“Biddyland” and escapes to man’s 
country, his ’copter lands on the 
roof of Nieman-Marcus and he 
comes out on ground level on a 
cayuse. 

Wal, pardner, this is the di- 
vided country that faces the in- 
vader when a gigantic spaceship 
hovers over West Alexandria, Va., 
and wipes it out with a backwash 
from its unknown propulsive 
power. When the invaders turn 
out to be gorgeous babes wear- 
ing metallic bras and skirts and 
seemingly without menfolk, you 
can see that problems might arise.

Wilson even throws in a new 
twist, a multitude of BEMs pur- 
sued by the above lightly clad 
FEMs. 

Something tells me that Wilson 
had as much fun writing this 
book as I had reading it. 

ALIEN MINDS by E. Everett 
Evans. Fantasy Press, Inc., $3.00 

F or some reason, the phrase 
“poor man’s E. E. Smith” 
kept running through my head 
while reading this work. The simi- 
larity of name helps; also, the fact 
that the plot of the story concerns 
a telepath incognito on an alien 
world smacks of old-time space 
opera. In particular, when this 
telepath is a Secret Operative of 
the Interstellar Corps who pur- 
sues his espionage through his 
control of insects, birds and beast- 
ies a la Kimball Kinnison, the 
result is a bit startling. 

However, as I said, this is the 
poor man’s version. 

George Hanlon, the off-the- 
beaten-telepath, is young, inexpe- 
rienced and inclined to be a bit 
of a sad-sack. Unlike his doughty 
predecessor, Kinnison, he doesn’t , 
haul keel above the surface of 
Estrella and go gallivanting 
through the parsecs once through- 
out the entire book. 

Still, after bumbling about a 
bit, he manages to find out why a 
sudden crime wave and burst of 



anti-Federated Planets feeling had 
almost killed the chances of Es- 
trella voting itself into the Fed- 
eration. That’s what is so hard for 
him to savvy. The Estrellans are 
basically extremely ethical peo- 
pue. It’s a feather in George Han- 
lon’s space helmet when he is 
able to spot the real and unsus- 
pected culprit. It is also pleasant 
to report that George isn’t a 
SUPERman. He’s a — well, a 
SUPERman. 

CAVIAR by Theodore Sturgeon. 
Ballantine Books, 35c 

CTURGEON is a prime exam- 
pie of the maturation of S-F 
over the past couple of decades 
and this volume is an excellent 
case in point. It contains eight 
stories, four of which appeared 
prior to 1946. All are good Stur- 
geon. 

However, the contrast between 
the early and recent stories is 
startling. “Microcosmic God,” 
“Medusa” and “Prodigy” all ap- 
peared in Asf and are straight 
science fiction done in a straight- 
forward reportorial manner. 
“Ghost of a Chance,” “Blabber- 
mouth” and “Shadow, Shadow on 
the Wall” appeared in various 
places and are fantasies, the last 
a shiny little horror story. “Bright 
Segment” is new and uncategoriz- 
able (shades of Gloria Locker- 
man!.). It is also a tremendous

mood story. And “Twink” ap- 
peared in this magazine last year. 

The last two items point up 
Sturgeon’s mastery of plot, tech- 
nique and suspense. For those un- 
fortunates who have not read his 
More than Human, the award- 
winning novel based on “Baby Is 
Three,” which apjjeared here 
first, this collection will serve as 
both introduction and • consola-

PREFERRED RISK by Edson 
McCann. Simon and Schuster, 
$2.75 

A S you no doubt know, this 
volume is the winner of the 
joint GALAXY-Simon and Schus- 
ter Contest and ran in these 
pages from June to September of 
last year. Like the Pohl-Korn- 
bluth novels, Gladiator-at-Law 
and Gravy Planet, this opus envi- 
sages a future in which' some 
present aspect of society has bur- 
geoned into a Frankenstein mon- 
ster. In this instance, insurance 
companies have made the logical 
step forward of preventing acci- 
dents, diseases and wars by tak- 
ing over the enforcement agen- 
cies. 

Policies are written for just 
about any and all necessaries as 
well as exigencies, having such 
names as Blue Plate, Blue Blan- 
ket and Blue Heaven. Sounds like 



Blue Heaven, indeed, but who 
needs insurance if everyone is 
healthy, whole and protected? 
And there lies the story! 

Even if you read it in this

ARK OF VENUS by Clyde B. 
Clason. Alfred A. Knopf, $2.00 

^ I 'HIS is a teen-age juvenile 
that has both good and bad 
points. It is well written and in- 
teresting and even gripping at 
times. It concerns a neglected son 
of a famous engineer. 

The father is constructing a 
spaceship for a final try at Venus, 
ten other expeditions having 
failed disastrously. The boy is in- 
vited to visit with his dad at the 
site in the Arctic after several 
years of separation. Earth has 
been completely exploited and 
new frontiers must be opened. 

Naturally, due to the previous 
failures, there is a great deal of 
feeling against the expedition, 
particularly when it involves three 
hundred people, one-third of the 
population of the Arctic town that 
has volunteered to attempt the 
trip. Fanatics make an abortive 
attempt to destroy the ship, 
wounding the father. The boy, 
Tal Roberts, to whom such an 
adventure previously was abhor- 
rent, is thus able to go along in

THE CAVES OF STEEL by 
Isaac Asimov. Signet Books, 35c 

IT ERE is another Galaxy se- 
rial that has gone through 
both printing and reprinting. Asi- 
mov’s fascinating science-detec- 
tive story here is republished as a 
paperback, after Doubleday did 
it last year in hard covers. 

If you recall the story, you will 
understand its deserved popular- 
ity. It takes place in the distant 
future, when Earth consists of en- 
closed cities of steel. The Spac- 
ers, who feel nothing but con- 
tempt and revulsion toward 
Earth, are descendants of Earth- 
men who colonized the Outer 
Planets and are at present virtu- 
ally quarantining Earth in its her- 
metic cities. 

When one of them is mur- 
dered, an explosive situation de- 
velops. Then the hero, an Earth 
detective, must of necessity work 
with a Spacer robot, in spite of 
his anti-robot bias. 

If you are a detective fan as 
well as a science fiction addict, 
you will get especial delight in 
pitting your wits against the au- 
thor’s. Betcha Asimov wins.

James E. Gunn. Gnome Press,

T WOULD say that the author 
did better on his own this time 
than he did in his collaboration 
with Jack Williamson in Star 
Bridge. If you remember that 
epic, you will recall the hero to 
whom nothing was impossible. 
Now there was a man! 

In comparison, William Dane 
— well, the jacket says he is a 
“callow acolyte.” That, I think, is 
going too far. Why, he got him- 
self an education that would 
equip him to make a living as a 
mugger iri any big town. 

This transformation comes 
about because of a girl fleeing 
into Dane’s cathedral while he is 
on duty in the miracle-making 
control room. She has a crystal 
pebble of obvious value, because, 
after entrusting it to Dane, she is 
murdered by the Mercenaries, 
bad eggs, let me tell you. Seems 
that, in the hero’s feudalistic 
world, the pebble has some sig- 
nificance for releasing the down- 
trodden masses. 

Dane has to flee the sanctuary 
of his monastery and do lotsa kill- 
ing in order to preserve the thing. 

And so develops “one of the 
most harrowing chases in Science- 
Literature.” 

You know something, they’re 
right! Then how is it that I got a 
kick out of the book? The answer 
must be that it did just what it 
set out to do — create excitement.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION- 



Time to Kill 

By E. C. TUBB 



He had been hired to commit 
a whodunit — now what turned 
it into whodunwhat-to-whom? 



T he man in the red cloak 
and mask led the way into 
a booth, hit the switch with 
the palm of his hand and, when 
the screen snapped across the 
opening, leaned forward. 

“Listen,” he said quietly. “What 
I want is simple. I want you to 
kill a man for me.” 

“Simple,” agreed Fenwick drily. 
He glanced around the" booth and 
then through the polarized screen 
into the main room. It was filled 
with the usual party crowd of 



men and women. From the way 
they stamped and snapped their 
fingers, he guessed that someone 
had switched on the tingle-tubes 
to full blast. From inside the 
booth, he couldn’t feel the intoxi- 
cating electronic pulsations. He 
couldn’t recognize anyone, either. 

The fad that year was for 
Renaissance costume. Last year 
it had been Victorian and next 
year it could be Grecian, but this 
year everyone wore long, sweep- 
ing cloaks from neck to heel and

oddly distorted masks which cov- 
ered the face to just above the 
mouth. 

Fenwick, even while obeying 
the dictates of fashion, thought it 
stupid. In his avocation — he had 
no vocation — it was necessary, 
even though it meant changing 
one’s whole wardrobe every year, 
which, of course, was the reason. 
It was good for business. 

“We are screened,” said the 
man when it became obvious that 
Fenwick had no intention of 
speaking. “You have nothing to 
fear.” 

“You have nothing to fear,” 
corrected Fenwick. “I don’t even 
know your name. You’re a stran- 
ger who invited me to join him in 
a private talk and now it turns 
out to be murder. What do you 
think I am?” 

13ENEATH the edge of the 
mask, the man’s lips curved 
into a smile. “I know what you 
are. You’re a hunter, a hardened 
slayer of the innocent and help- 
less.” 

“Hunting is not murder,” Fen- 
wick said. 

“No? Tell me, what is the dif- 
ference between killing a bull ape 
and a man?” 

“You pay a heavy fine if you 
are caught killing an ape,” said 
Fenwick bluntly. “The punish- 
ment is rather more severe for 
killing a man.” 

90 



“Is it? But the reward would 
be higher. Very much higher in- 
deed— and you needn’t be 
caught.” 

And there he put his finger on 
the important thing. Fenwick had 
no conscience; if he had, he would 
never have been a hunter in the 
first place. But he did have a 
healthy regard for his own skin. 
To kill was simple; to escape the 
consequences of murder was 
something else. 

“No motive,” urged the man. 
“No possible suspicion. No rea- 
son or cause for the police to look 
for you at all. If any man on 
Earth can commit murder and 
get away with it, it’s you.” 

“You flatter me.” Fenwick 
wished the man would remove his 
mask so he could read his ex- 
pression. “But I am no assassin.” 

“You need money and, as I 
said, the reward would be high.” 

“High enough to be worth risk- 
ing my life?” 

“It wouldn’t come to that. A 
quick attack, a quick escape. 
Nothing to it.” 

“The police are clever,” re- 
minded Fenwick. Despite himself, 
he was intrigued by the proposal. 
Killing, as the stranger had said, 
came easily to him, but lately the 
slaughter of inoffensive creatures 
had grown stale. Hunting had be- 
come too easy, but what about 
other prey? 

“The police are clever,” ad- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mitted the stranger, “but not as 
clever as they would like you to 
think. You know their routine? 
Everyone remotely connected 
with any crime is given null- 
censor and questioned beneath a 
lie detector. If a suspect is guilty, 
they will find him. But what if 
the guilty person is not a suspect? 
Can they question the ten million 
inhabitants of this city?” 

He reached beneath his cloak 
'and paper rustled as he produced 
a sheaf of crisp new bills. “I said 
that the reward would be high. 
Twenty thousand credits, to be 
exact.” He pushed the notes to- 
ward the hunter. “Would you call 
that high enough?” 

^ENWICK sweated behind his 

mask. Until now, he had re- 
garded the entire thing as a joke, 
the stranger accosting him at the 
party, the conversation, the sug- 
gested murder. The sight of the 
money made it all very real. 

“If you want this man dead so 
badly, why not kill him your- 
self?” Fenwick asked. 

“I have a motive, obviously, or 
I would not want him dead.” The 
man smiled again, his lips moist 
beneath his mask. “Still thinking 
of the police?” 

“You’re damned right I am. No 
one has been murdered for the 
past fifty years. No crime of any 
kind has been unsolved in all that 
time. There are rumors—” 



“They’re false,” said the man 
quickly. “The police don’t have 
a machine with which they can 
look back through time. It’s just 
propaganda to discourage poten- 
tial criminals.” 

“Perhaps. But how can you be 
sure?” 

“Because I know. But even if 
they had such a machine, what of 
it? You will be masked and are a 
trained hunter — you know how 
to cover your tracks. They won’t 
know who you are and how can 
they check a whole city? But the 
question doesn’t apply — there is 
no such machine.” He fingered 
the money, letting the edges of 
the notes riffle over the ball of his 
thumb. “And there is no longer 
any death penalty.” 

“Right,” said Fenwick thought- 
fully. “But the risk is still great.” 

“The risk is as great as you 
care to make it,” said the man 
evenly. “Look at it as a challenge. 
You, the hunter, against the full 
power of the law. You must kill 
and then you must escape. For 
you, the killing will be easy — and 
the escape should prove exciting.” 
He riffled the money again and 
Fenwick stared at it. 

“I could agree and walk out bf 
here and forget what you want 
me to do,” he pointed out. 

The man nodded. “You could,” 
he said easily. “Will you?” 

, “No.” Fenwick picked up the 
money. 



TIME TO KILL 



91 



T he victim was a man named 
Carl Gerard. He was about 
Fenwick’s own age and lived in a 
class B apartment. Why the 
stranger wanted him dead was 
something Fenwick didn’t bother 
to think about. Gerard was 
quarry. He was twenty thousand 
credits. 

First Fenwick arranged for his 
escape. A travel agency sold him 
a ticket on the Mars Express 
leaving every night at midnight 
from the local field. To lure the 
quarry from his lair and then to 
identify him was the hardest part 
of the whole business. Even that, 
however, proved disappointingly 
easy. 

From a costumers, Fenwick 
bought a female skin-mask com- 
plete with artificial hair. He found 
a videophone with a tone-selector, 
adjusted it to emulate a female 
voice and called Gerard. He 
aroused no suspicions. If anything, 
Gerard was too eager to meet the 
strange female who had called 
him to suggest a date. 

Rendezvous time was set for 
nine o’clock at a busy corner. 
With time to kill, Fenwick bought 
a -ticket to a horrorscope and sat 
in thoughtful silence while all 
around him men and women 
shrieked and shivered to the arti- 
ficial stimulation of their nerves 
and glands. He had reason to be 
thoughtful — he was thinking of 
the temporal police. 

92 



The stranger had denied the 
existence of any machine which 
was able to scan time. Rumor had 
it otherwise, but that could have 
been instigated by the police and 
cleverly publicized. 

If there were such a machine, 
though, it would account for the 
crime-free fifty years. No mur- 
derer could hope to escape if the 
police could scan back and actu- 
ally see him at work. Even if 
masked and disguised, he 
wouldn’t stand a chance. All the 
police need do was follow his 
image back in time until they saw 
him as he really was. 

For a moment, Fenwick con- 
sidered abandoning the whole 
thing. Then, as he thought about 
it, he shrugged. His employer, 
whoever he was, had gauged him 
too well. The thrill of the hunt 
was in his blood, the problem in- 
trigued him, and he knew that he 
was going, to earn his money. 

Ansrway, no one knew for cer- 
tain whether or not there was a 
time-scanning machine. And even 
if there wgre, it would take time 
for the police to identify him. By 
then, he would be halfway to 
Mars and beyond their jurisdic- 
tion. He relaxed, amused at the 
gasps and shudders of those 
around him even as his own skin 
crawled and adrenalin flooded 
into his bloodstream. 

Half an hour before rendez- 
vous time, he left the theater and, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



taking an elementary precaution, 
walked toward the scavenger part 
of the city. It was unhealthy in its 
deserted houses and broken 
streets, but it was scantily popu- 
lated and, more important, badly 
lit. 

He stepped into a pool of dark- 
ness, neat and trim in his puce 
cloak and mask. He stepped out 
again dressed in light blue. With 
no time to waste, he caught a 
’copcab. Five minutes later, he 
was at the rendezvous. 

Gerard was early. He stood on 
the comer, conspicuous in his yel- 
low cloak and mask, both orna- 
mented with black arabesques — 
the cloak and mask that he had 
told his caller he would be wear- 
ing. In turn, he looked for a sil- 
ver assembly, the most unlikely 
color Fenwick could think of. 
Watching him, the hunter felt a 
rising excitement. He was in no 
hurry. It would take less than fif- 
teen minutes by ’copcab to the 
field and the less time between 
the murder and takeoff, the bet- 
ter. His deadline was thirty min- 
utes before midnight, which left 
ninety minutes to go. Ninety min- 
utes in which to watch and stalk, 
to baffle the quarry and head him 
on the path he must take. Ninety 
minutes of skill and cunning cul- 
minating in the final moment of 
victory when the knife he carried 
beneath his cloak would sink into 
warm and living flesh. 

94 



He could afford to wait. 

It was almost an hour before 
Gerard admitted to himself that 
the call had been a hoax. Reluc- 
tantly he moved away and behind 
him, like a colorful figure of des- 
tiny, Fenwick waited for time 
and place to coincide. 

Gerard seemed aimless. He 
wandered at random, staring at 
the window displays, looking at 
the public information strips, 
glancing at the scintillaiit bursts 
of the flash-advertising, acting 
more like a yokel than the city- 
dweller he was. 

A fter a while, Gerard went 
into a tavern and Fenwick, 
always cautious, waited outside. 
When Gerard came out, he 
seemed nervous. He kept glanc- 
ing over his shoulder, his yellow 
mask grotesque in the shimmer- 
ing light of the advertisements, 
and his pace had increased from 
a casual saunter to a determined 
walk. 

And yet he didn’t head back 
toward the safety of his apart- 
ment. He followed an erratic, 
winding path which led him 
through side turnings and narrow 
passages between the towering 
buildings and his direction, in- 
credible as it seemed, was toward 
the bright glow of a ’copcab 
center. 

Fenwick chuckled as he in- 
creased his pace and cut down the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



distance between them. High on a 
building, the illuminated face of 
a clock warned him that his time 
was running out, but he wasn’t 
worried. - From the center, he 
could get transportation to the 
field so that, though Gerard 
didn’t know it,' h^ was actually 
■ helping his murdei*er to escape. 

The - man in- the yellow cloak 
seemed even mbffe nfervous than 
before. He pausdd at -the mouth 
of a nairOw all6y windihg- be- 
; -tween- two brightly -' lit streets. 
Then, his ' - head flow'd between

hundred metfers, he would rfeach 
the mouth of the'alley before him. 
He would- bump - into him in the 
sheltered darkness,' kill and be on 
his way to Mars before anyone 
discovered the body. 

He smiled as he put his plan 
into execution. 

There was a big red sign at the 
corner of the alley where it joined 
the main street. It flared and died, 
flared and died, so that the walls 
and gutters seemed painted in 
blood and darkness. It flared as 
he reached the corner. It flared 
again as he stepped into the alley. 
It flared one more time as he 



struck at the man in the yellow 
cloak, thumb to the blade and 
ripping upward in the murderous 
slash he had learned as an ap- 
prentice hunter. 

Before the body fell; he was 
running down the alley, wiping 
his hand on the inside 6f- his cloak 
and the blood and fingerprints 
from the knife befdre throwing 'it 
away. He’d had it so Icmg thiatmo

T here -was no triall Tfial sup-

and Fenwick owned them all. 

“How?” he asked for the hun- 
dredth time. “I’d just committed 
the crime. How did the officers 
get there so fast?” 

“The temporal police?” The 
man they had assigned to him 
looked bored. “Surely that’s obvi- 
ous. When we discovered the 
body, it was simple to determine 
the time of death. So the officers 
merely went back to just before 
the actual moment.” He looked 
tiredly at Fenwick. “Didn’t you 
know we could travel backward 
in time?” 



TIME TO Kill 



95 



“I’d heard that you could scan 
the past, but not actually travel 
to it. Can you? Scan it, I mean?” 
“No. I wish we could. It would 
make things so much easier.” 

“I see.” So in one thing, at 
least, the stranger had told the 
truth. Fenwick frowned at the 
wall of his cell. “But if you can 
travel back, then why didn’t you 
prevent the murder?” 

“How could we?” The man — 
Johnson, his name was — shielded 
a yawn. “If there had been no 
murder, there would have been no 
murder to prevent. No body, you 
understand, so there would have 
been no reason for going back at 
all.” 

“I don’t get it,” complained 
Fenwick. “Or do I? No murder, 
so no body, so no reason for go- 
ing back. But if you didn’t go 
back, there would have been a 
body. So . .” He broke off look- 
ing baffled. “A paradox!” 

“No,” said Johnson. “There are 
no pardoxes in time.” 

Fenwick shook his head. “What 
about if someone went back and 
killed his grandfather?” 

“I’m tired of hearing that old 
chestnut,” said Johnson. “All right, 
what would happen if a man did 
that? First, if he killed his grand- 
father after his father had been 
born, it wouldn’t make the slight- 
est difference. If he killed him be- 
fore his father had been con- 
ceived, then, naturally, he couldn’t 



exist. As he didn’t exist, he 
couldn’t have killed his grand- 
father. So, being alive, he didn’t 
kill his grandfather. He can't kill 
his grandfather. The argument is 
ridiculous.” 

“It still seems like a paradox 
to me,” insisted Fenwick. 

“There can be no paradox in 
time. Think about it for a while 
and you’ll understand why.” 

“To hell with it,” said Fenwick 
disgustedly. “All I know is that 
I’ve been caught. What happens 
to me now?” 

“The only thing left to happen 
— your punishment.” 

<r<rTY^TURALLY,” agreed Fen- 
^ wick dryly. “Pardon my 
curiosity, but just what form will 
that punishment take?” 

“You murdered a man,” said 
Johnson. “What punishment do 
you expect?” 

“There’s no death penalty,” 
Fenwick said. “Or is that another 
piece of trickery, like not letting 
people know you can go back in 
time?” 

“No. You will not be legally 
murdered.” 

“What then? Ten years impris- 
onment? A lifetime?” 

“Oh, nothing like that.” John- 
son seemed to have recovered his 
gocd humor. “A peculiar thing, 
time travel. Unfortunately we are 
limited to fifty years, so we can- 
not satisfy our curiosity as to the 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



past. Also, its uses are strictly 
limited. No tourists, for example, 
no exploitation or exploring or 
going back to visit dead relatives. 
No paradoxes,” he explained. “If 
you went back to visit your dead 
father, he would know it. He 
would have told you, so you 
would know it. Since he didn’t, 
you didn’t, so you won’t. Simple.” 

“In other words, the police 
have suppressed it and use it 
solely to fight crime.” Fenwick 
wasn’t fooled. He had recognized 
Johnson’s hate for a murderer. 
“Interesting, but what’s it got to 
do with me?” 

“I’m telling you,” said John- 
son mildly. “You committed a 
murder. We caught you, but our 
job is as much to prevent crime 
as to avenge it. But a body had 
to be discovered in order for us 
to catch you.” He smiled at Fen- 
wick’s expression. “Think about 
it. You were caught, therefore you 
must have killed. Because you 
killed, you must be punished. Yet, 
at the same time, we must protect 
the public, so we cannot let you 
kill an innocent man in order that 
we can catch you to punish you.” 

He rose and looked down at 
the hunter. “It’s all very simple. 
I’m sure that you will be able to 
appreciate the justice of it be- 
fore long.” He smiled and some- 
thing metallic gleamed in his 
hand. Fenwick recognized it as a 
hypo-gun and, for the first time 



since his capture, felt fear. 

“Wait a minute! What about 
the man who hired me? Isn’t he 
guilty, too?” 

“Why should he be? Intent is 
harmless without execution. You 
could have refused to commit the 
murder.” 

“But . .” 

I'T E broke off because Johnson 
had gone, the cell had gone, 
everything had gone and he was 
sitting in a tavern with a drink in 
his hand, while all around him 
drummed the frenetic pounding 
of jazz. 

“Crazy,” he muttered and shook 
his head. But he wasn't crazy and 
this, as he soon discovered, was 
cold reality and not a dream. 

He examined himself. He was 
wearing a yellow cloak and mask, 
both adorned with black ara- 
besques. It was a familiar cloak; 
he had seen it before, but just 
when and where, he couldn’t re- 
member. 

Drugs, of course — he still felt 
doped. Johnson had knocked him 
out with the hypo-gun and they 
had drugged and dressed him and 
brought him to this tavern. But 
why? Why? 

He shook his head and finished 
the drink and looked around for 
the police who must be guarding 
him. He didn’t see any and began 
to have hopes that he was really 
free. 



TIME TO KILL 



97 



Leaving the tavern, he walked 
down the street. He walked 
quickly, glancing behind him for 
fear of seeing a hated uniform, 
but aside from a man in a light 
blue cloak and mask, no one 
seemed to be following him. It 
was while he was walking that the 
drug began to wear off. 

The streets were familiar, too 
familiar; So were the shop^ the 
displays, the advertising signs — 
even his very movements. 

The man in the .blue cloak! 
Himself in yellowl- 

Gerard had worn a yellow 
cloak; he had worn a blue one. 
The man following him was him- 
self! The streets he had walked 
down then.- were the same ones he 
walked down now! 

Grudgingly, he admired the 
beauty of it. The tables turned, 
the hunter hunted. The paradox 
resolved by the simple expedient 
of making himself his own mur- 
derer. 

But if he'd killed himself, then 
how could he be guilty of killing 
Gerard? And if he hadn’t killed 
Gerard, why was he being pun- 
ished? Or was he? There were no 
guards, no police, nothing to pre- 
vent him going to the spaceport 
and catching the midnight Ex- 
press to Mars. The bright glow of 
a ’copcab center attracted him 
and he headed toward it. 

Behind him, the man in blue 
quickened his pace. 

98 



F enwick thought of stopping 
and facing him and explaining 
what had happened. He didn’t be- 
cause he knew himself too well. 
The man in blue intended killing 
the man in yellow. It wasn’t a 
question of personalities or ex- 
planations; as soon as time and 
place were right, the blow would 
be struck and Eenwick would be 
dead. And there was another, 
more important reason. 

Fenwick had neither money 
-nor a ticket, but the man in blue 
had both. And there was only one 
way to get therti. 

'■ He simulated fear, glancing 
constantly over ‘bis shoulder and 
almost runnings down a narrow 
alley he remembered from before. 
He smiled as' he saw his follower 
hesitate and then run down the 
street. He knew exactly what he 
intended and he would be ready 
for him. He wasn’t Gerard, that 
timid fool whom the police had 
obviously removed to safety after 
putting Fenwick in his place. He 
was a hunter, as skilled and as 
strong as the man in blue and 
he knew what the man in blue 
was going to do. No hunter could 
have a bigger advantage than 
that. 

The man in blue would race 
around the other way to head 
him off. Fenwick knew it even be- 
fore the other suddenly made the 
decision, for he had done it him- 
self. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But then what? The man in 
blue had a knife and he didn’t. 

But he had the cape — and 
there was a refuse can. He draped 
the cape over it and stood worry- 
ing for an instant. It didn’t look 
at all like a man; it was too short 
and squat. He dragged it over to 
the wall, where even the big red 
sign that kept flaring into life left 
it in shadow. Would that fool the 
man in blue into thinking it was 
his quarry hunched down fear- 
fully, hoping to escape detection? 
Even more important, could he 
himself rewrite the past? 

There was no time to think 
further — the man in blue came 
running into the alley. Fenwick 
pressed back out of sight in the 
deeper shadow. The man in blue 
hesitated only for a second before 
thrusting the knife into the cape. 
As soon as the blade rang against 
the metal of the refuse can, Fen- 
wick had stepped behind the man 
in blue and chopped at the back 
of the neck with the edge of his 
palm — not too hard, for he didn’t 
want to kill his earlier self, yet 
powerfully enough to knock him 
out. 

He knew just where the money 
and the ticket were, and he had 
them out in a flash of movement 
and was running toward the end 
of the alley. He faltered there, ap- 
prehensive, but there were no po- 
lice waiting. Almost arrogantly 
then, he flagged a ’copcab qnd 



ordered it to take him out to the 
spaceport. 

I T was on the way that bewil- 
derment hit him. No paradox, 
eh? Gerard hadn’t been mur- 
dered. Fenwick hadn’t been killed 
by the man in blue, as Johnson 
had planned. The man in blue 
was unconscious but safe. 

Then what crime had been 
committed? None — and yet Fen- 
wick had to flee to Mars! If he 
turned back, he had no assurance 
that he would not be picked up 
by the temporal police. 

Scowling, he tried to reason it 
out. The spaceport lights were 
glaring below when he finally 
found the answer. It made him 
smile — a bitter and yet admiring 
smile. 

Naturally there had been no 
crime committed, either by him 
or anyone else in the past fifty 
years! But he had been willing to 
kill, just as others had undoubt- 
edly been willing to murder or 
steal, and that was enough for the 
temporal police. If he didn’t go to 
Mars, they were sure to have an- 
other trick like substituting him 
for his victim. Only, of course, he 
wouldn’t put them to the bother; 
that one or the next might work. 

Not feeling a bit jaunty, as a 
hunter should, Fenwick turned in 
his ticket and went aboard the 
ship for Mars.

than eight hundred hours of com- 
bat sweeps against the enemy. 
Risky? Sure— operating a thous- 
and meters under the surface of 
the sea, everything is a risk, and 
the enemy made it its business to 
make the risks high. But war is 
hell; you expect danger in war. 
The only thing was — where was 
the war? 

You only go to war with coun- 
tries, and the Caodais weren’t a 
country; they were a religion that 
had swept up out of Indo-China 
and through all of Asia, Oceania 
and Africa. But war? No, it wasn’t 
war. If it were, both sides would 
use the A-bomb, the H-bomb, the 
C-bomb, the bacteriological-war- 
fare sprays and mists and dusts. 

So it wasn’t war, because that 
would be the end of everything. 
But meanwhile we kept pounding 
each other — strictly on neutral 
territory, like Europe or the open 
sea. And meanwhile we kept do- 
ing odd things to each other — 
taking prisoners, for instance. 

Elsie was only one prisoner, 
but she was the one who counted 
with me, because she was my 
wife. She volunteered, when it 
would have been months before

the universal draft caught her. 
Even worse than that, the first 
thing she did was voluntarily go 
on a courier flight over Caodai 
territory, and naturally the Cao- 
dais niked her down; and ^ she 
was alive and safe in a prison 
camp on Zanzibar, the Red Cross 
told me. It wasn’t so bad while I 
was on combat duty afloat, but 
then I was transferred to a top- 
priority, .most-secret, ultra-urgent 
naval project on the Florida 
shore. 

Project Mako was the biggest 
disappointment I had in the 
Navy. It was a dairy farm! Com- 
mander Lineback told me, the 
day I arrived, that I would find it 
a pretty unusual dairy farm. I 
watched the cattle being milked, 
I heard their drovers give them 
the orders tor the day, I listened 
to the cattle arguing back. And 
then I went to Lineback with 
blood in my eye. Unusual! What 
vi'as unusual about that? But he 
calmed me down by promising 
new developments as soon as cer- 
tain equipment and personnel ar- 
rived. 

But the new developments 
came earlier than that, or one 
new development did: 

The Glotch. Some people called 
it that, but I’ve also heard it 
called ‘‘unidentified ballistic phe- 
nomenon, presumably hostile.” It 
was a kind of radiation burn that 
killed — all but me. I got it; I was 



lucky; I survived. But if the Cao- 
dais could reach out and strike 
down someone anywhere in 
America as easily as it appeared, 
that was the end for us. 

Anyway, the new equipment 
arrived, and with it the new per- 
sonnel. I found out what we were 
supposed to be doing: research 
into animal communication. What 
did the Navy have to do with 
talking to animals? And what, for 
that matter, did some of the new 
personnel have to do with the 
Navy? 

Senior Lieutenant Semyon II- 
yitch Timayazev, late of Kras- 
noye Armee, now, since the Red 
Army no longer mattered to any- 
body, a military attache of the 
People’s Democratic Tsarist 
Republican Russian Government- 
in-Exile ; , he was one of the new 
personnel, and a dog-trainer by 
vocation. A dog-trainer! And he 
ranked me — me, an officer of the 
line! But at least we were doing 
something and I began to suspect 
that maybe, somewhere, there 
was some purpose behind all this, 
when Project Mako suffered a se- 
rious interruption. There was a 
ship-to-shore shelling from Cao- 
dais somewhere out in the Atlan- 
tic, coupled with an outbreak in 
the prisoner stockade down the 
beach. I found myself out in a 
scout torp again, scouring the sub- 
sea area for the Caodai ships. 

I found them. Eight of them. 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



E ight Caodais — corvettes at 
the least, by the size of them 
in the sonar screen. And I was in 
a little thirty-foot torp, with four 
missiles to fight with. If I got a 
4.0 hit with every one of them, 
that still left four to beat the dub- 
bing out of me. 

I didn’t feel heroic; I felt 
scared. But I didn’t turn around 
and run for it, either. 

If I ran, they could catch me. 
If I attacked, they could pound 
me to pieces before I got within 
range. If I sat still and prayed, I 
would at least enhance my dubi- 
ous prospects of getting to 
heaven, which would at any rate 
be something constructive so my 
last minutes on Earth wouldn’t be 
a total loss. But what I did was 
fight. 

It was habit and instinct and 
routine. Full speed forward, turn 
the navigation over to the auto- 
pilot. Cut the fire-control remotes 
in on missile Number One, dis- 
criminate, lock, arm, fire. Cut in 
on Number Two, fire Number 
Two. Cut in on Number Three, 
fire Number Three. Cut in on 
Number Four, fire Number Four 
. and then- it was time to run. 

In fact, it was past time. They 
were on course for me and I was 
on course for them; we had closed 
to less than five thousand yards. 
By the time I came about,' it was 
forty-five hundred — and a cor- 
vette can catch a scout torp with 



a forty-five-hundred-yard lead in 
roughly twenty minutes. It is only 
a matter of relative speeds. Of 
course, in twenty minutes I could 
be closer inshore than they would 
dare to follow — 

But they didn’t really have to 
catch me. Their missiles would do 
the job for them. 

1 WATCHED the sonar screen 
with very close attention. It 
was all I could do. There were the 
eight of them, big and ugly by 
now;, there were the four stag- 
gered little streaks that were my 
missiles. And there — yes, there, 
just before the lead Caodai, were 
two other little glowing streaks. 
They were missiles, but they 
weren’t mine. 

I kicked the auto-armor pedal 
home. My scout was now defen- 
sively armed; it was dropping 
random-sized masses of fine-spun 
metallic wool into the slipstream, 
hoping to divert the Caodai mis- 
siles. 

Unfortunately, the Caodai were 
doing the same. I saw a mush- 
rooming flare around one of my 
missiles as it went off, far out of 
effective range of the enemy craft, 
triggered, no doubt, by just such 
a blob of chaff. And another. And 
then the sonar screen was awash 
with light from rim to rim. The 
pressure spheres surrounding the 
exploding missiles confused Jthe 
sound waves, made them return 
conflicting images.

I scrambled the sonar screen 
and snapped on the audic. At 
least I would know if something 
big was getting close to me. 

Something big was! But not the 
Caodais — it came from due south, 
down the coast, and it was big 
and fast. IFF gave the answer: It 
was a Spruance-class cruiser, com- 
ing to the rescue. 

The Caodai might get me, but 
Big Brother was going to get 
them! I snapped open the TBS 
and yelled excitedly; “Welcome 
to the party! I’ll give you my 
bearings for cross-check. My grid 
position — ” 

But I didn’t finish. Audic tin- 
kled and cut out in my earphones. 
There had been a nearby explo- 
sion and the filters, designed to 
keep the wearer from ruptured 
eardrums, had cut off the amplifi- 
cation. 

I waited for the smash. 

I never heard it, but I felt it. 
Something hit the side of my 
head and that was all, brother, 
that was all. 

the good die young,” 
growled somebody with a 
Russian accent. 

I sat up abruptly. “Semyon!” I 
said. “What-” 

The heel of his hand caught 
me in the chest and I went back 
down again. “Doctor says to lie 
still! You should have been dead, 
Logan! Don’t provoke fortune!” 

)04 



Well, I was alive, though it 
took me a while to believe it. 
What had hit me had been noth- 
ing but concussion, and the torp, 
though sprung a little at the 
seams, was still infact. The auto- 
pilot shut itself off when the hull 
was breached and, when nobody 
took the controls, automatically 
surfaced the vessel — and hydro- 
foils found it, with me inside. But 
I was alive. 

“Did they get them?” I de- 
manded. 

“Get who? The Orientals?” 
Semyon shrugged. “They did not 
yet have the courtesy to report to 
me, Logan. I can only assume — ” 
“All right. What about the 
stockade?” 

“Ha,” he said, sitting up. “Such 
a struggle, Logan! Through the 
jungle like savages, screaming and 
fighting, deadly beyond—” 

“What about the stockade?” 
“Is over,” he grumbled. “We 
fought a little bit, and then armor 
began coming up from the high- 
way, and when the Orientals saw 
the tanks, they ran. Oh, some got 
through; they will be caught.” 

So that was that. Well, I 
thought, leaning back against the 
pillows of the sick-bay and listen- 
ing to the thumping in my head, 
it wasn’t so bad, after all. 

A free ride in a scout torp — 
I’d thought I’d never get to pilot 
one again. A successful, or any- 
way fairly successful, combat

sweep against superior odds. A 
sure commendation in my file 
jacket, maybe even a citation 
from COMINCH. Who knows, 
possibly a Navy Cross — stranger 
things had happened. And the 
whole thing was over, a pleasant 
interlude in a dull existence. 

What I didn’t know was that 
nothing is ever really over. 

Semyon said commandingly: 
“The doctor!” I sat up and he 
pushed me down again. 

The doctor poked me and 
looked into my eyes. “Back on 
duty in the morning. Mean- 
while 

He reached for a needle. I pro- 
tested: “I can go to sleep without 
that!” 

“That’s good,” he said, squeez- 
ing the plunger. 

¥ SAW him going out the door 
■■■ and then, magically, he was 
turning around and coming back, 
only it wasn’t the doctor any 
more. 

It was Elsie, just the way 
she had been the day we were 
married, lovely and desirable and 
all the wife a man could want. 

“Darling,” I said to her and she 
bent and kissed me. and held me 
in her arms. And then, all of a 
sudden, her left eye blossomed 
out in a ripple of greenish light, 
and then her nose, and then she 
was awash from side to side with 
light, just like a sonar scope, and 



the rest of the dream was hardly 
pleasapt at all. 

But I was fit for duty the next 
morning. And what’s more, they 
put me to work. 

Remember Manhattan Proj- 
ect? They had a big, difficult, im- 
portant job. They needed an iso- 
tope of uranium — Uo.-,,-,, as every 
schoolboy knows, and they needed 
lots of it. They even knew ways 
they might get it — had got it, in 
microgram quantities. There was 
thermal diffusion — the endless 
flow of uranium salts through os- 
motic barriers. There was the 
mass spectograph. There was the 
“breeder” reaction. And there 
were others. Manhattan Project 
had to make a decision. 

So they decided to do them all. 

That was the military mind at 
work, and who is to say they were 
wrong? Project Mako worked 
along the same lines. We had half 
a dozen paralleling projects going 
at once. Lineback’s own group 
was tediously expanding their vo- 
cabulary of Cow. Semyon Tima- 
yazev was bedeviling his little 
dogs with yes-no codes, persuad- 
ing them to talk to him. A team 
of four full lieutenants was read- 
ing meaning into the elevation of 
a dog’s tail and translating it into 
flipper-positions for the seals they 
were given to work with. And 
more. 

And I, with a fifty-year-old 
Wave, a Barnard graduate with a 



SLAVE SHIP 



105 



degree in statistical mathematics, 
to help me — I was assigned the 
programing of a computer series 
that would make sense out of 
what they were doing. 

It was simple enough to assign 
conceptual values to the parts of 
language and I couldn’t complain 
about the equipment the Navy 
gave me. The basic unit was an 
old RAGNAROK, but some con- 
siderate genius in BuSup had 
added a self-checking circuit to 
flush triple voltage through the 
tubes to pick off the bad ones, be- 
tween operations, so that the unit 
was pretty reliably good for 99- 
six-nines per cent effective opera- 
tion. 

There were forty-eight memory 
tanks in the mercury-delay class, 
plus a batch of magnetic drums 
for instructions and a large elec- 
trostatic storage unit. With its 
card punch, reader and tele- 
printer, it pretty well filled my 
space. 

I looked at it and ^eltisome- 
thing like the midget who mar- 
ried the circus fat lady. It was a 
lot of computer to handle all by 
myself. 

UT the hard part wasn’t run- 
ning the computer; it was 
making sense out of what came 
out. 

Semyon had told me so. He 
formed the habit of dropping in 
on me for a coffee break now and 

106 - 



then. I don’t know if all Russians 
are the same way, and if they are, 
it might account for the way they 
made out in the war, for he 
seemed to need his coffee break 
every hour on the hour. 

He said: “Is a question of vo- 
cabulary, Logan. RAGNAROK 
has not the vocabulary.’’ 

I said stiffly: “A computer a 
quarter the size of RAGNAROK 
translated Russian back in the 
’fifties.” 

“Ah, Russian, you say? It is the 
language of animals, you say?” 

“I didn’t mean—” 

“No, no. I do not mean I am 
insulted. I only ask, is Russian 
the language of animals? It is not, 
we will suppose. It is merely a 
human language.” 

“Merely?” 

“Merely! Small vocabulary, you 
see. Not like animal, large.” 

I stared at him. “If I under- 
stand what you’re saying, which is 
unlikely, you’re trying to tell me 
that animals have a bigger vocab- 
ulary than Russ — than people 
have.” 

“Exactly so, Logan. Think! Is it 
engraved on your machine, that 
motto? ‘Think!’ Read the motto, 
Logan, and do as it says. Think, 
for example, if an animal pos- 
sesses the capacity for abstract , 
thought. He does not, you will 
say? Correct.” 

“But that makes for a smaller 
vocabulary, doesn’t it?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Semyon crossed his legs, sipped 
his coffee and got ready for a nice, 
long chat. 

He said professorially: “Be, for 
the moment, my little dog Josip 
and think of how he thinks. Are 
you and I ‘men,’ Logan, in Josip’s 
eyes? Or is each of us a man, an 
individual — you, perhaps, ‘man 
who sits and watches’ and I ‘man 
who makes clicking sounds and 
gives food’? It is the latter, you 
will see. For that is how nouns 
begin in speech, as proper nouns, 
not class-words but names for 
particular things. This is why, 
with Josip, I have followed in the 
great tradition of my mother and 
cut to the root. Two words! Just 
a single word and a silence which 
is — ” 

“You told me,” I said shortly. 
“Do you mean that to an animal, 
each thing has its own individual 
word?” 

“I simplify,” Semyon said sun- 
nily. “But you grasp my mean- 
ing.” 

I did — and I also grasped his 
arm and escorted him to the door. 
He’d made the job look even 
harder than before. 

'Y^ET things got done. Three 
days after the Caodai incident, 
we were in full swing. The seeker 
groups fed me long lines of sym- 
bols, representing — they thought 
— the conceptual elements of the 
language of cows and seals, dogs 



and rabbits, cats and pigs. We got 
nowhere with the rabbits — too 
stupid; and the pigs were farm- 
bred, too fat to do anything but 
eat. But with the other animals, 
there was progress. 

The seekers watched the ani- 
mals the way Haroun al Raschid 
watched his harem favorites. 
They recorded every sound, pho- 
tographed every movement. With 
chemical nostrils, they examined 
the odors the animals gave off 
(someone had remembered that 
bees use odor to indicate sources 
of nectar); with a million dollars’ 
worth of electronic equipment, 
they palped the electromagnetic 
spectrum for signals that coarse 
human senses could not read. 

And they found things — sound, 
scent, bocfy pwsture, bodily ftinc- 
tions: these were the elements of 
language. 

Whatever seemed to have 
meaning, they assigned a symbol, 
even if the meaning itself was 
not clear. (Usually it wasn’t.) 
Then they had a list of the essen- 
tial parts of the animal vocabu- 
lary — lacking translations, for the 
most part, but very nearly com- 
plete. And that was half their job. 

The other half was to record, in 
infinite detail, everything the ani- 
mals felt and saw and experi- 
enced. That was the list of refer- 
rents for the “word” symbols. 

The two lists gave, first, the 
“words,” second, the meanings. 



SLAVE SHIP 



107 



And then it was up to me and 
my Wave to tape the findings, 
program them and feed them to 
RAGNAROK, so that RAGNA- 
ROK’s patient electronic mind 
could, from frequency and from 
context and from comparison with 
the known parts of other lan- 
guages, match symbols with refer- 
ents and make for us a dictionary 
of Pig and Cat and Seal. 

I made the dictionary, but 
when I thought I could use it to 
win an argument with Semyon, I 
was kidding myself. He came 
wandering in one afternoon for 
coffee and found the first pages of 
a typed report summarizing what 
we had learned of Essential Cat. 

I tapped him on the shoulder. 
“It says ‘Most Secret’ at the top 
of the page,” I reminded him. 

“Eh?” He looked at me ab- 
sently. “Of course, Logan. Most 
interesting. I will return it in the 
morning.” 

¥ STOPPED him as he was 
walking out the door and took 
it away from him. “You’ll prob- 
ably get a copy, but not from me. 
Anyway, you won’t enjoy it, be- 
cause it makes a liar out of you.” 

“Oh?” He beamed at me. “Is 
difficult, Logan. How often can a 
maiden be betrayed? And what is 
this lie?” 

I hesitated, then showed him. 
After all, he’d already looked at 
it. “Cat,” I said. “Look them over, 

108 



Semyon. Fifty - eight symbols, 
that’s all. Seven tail movements, 
three kinds of rictus, twenty-two 
noises — add them up. Fifty-eight. 
And you said the animal vocabu- 
lary would be larger than the 
human.” 

“I did,” he acknowledged. “And 
I still do. Fifty-eight symbols, but 
are they fifty-eight words? I think 
not. Call them phonemes, like the 
sounds of English. There are for- 
ty-some of those, I think? But put 
them together this way and that, ^ 
and you have three, four, I do not 
know how many hundred thou- 
sand words.” He sighed. “I have 
one question for you, Logan. 
When you were knocked uncon- 
scious by the Orientals in that 
little boat — how could you tell?” 
“Good-by, Semyon,” I said, 
holding open the door. 

The next morning, we had our 
raid. It started out normally 
enough — punctually, one hour af- 
ter breakfast, Semyon showed up 
with the coffee containers and his 
usual good humor. 

I said: “I’m busy, Semyon.” 

He smiled forgivingly. "Khora- 
shaw. That means, ‘I do not 
mind,’ ” he explained. “Will you 
pass me the sugar?” 

I sighed and passed it. I 
counted: Six spioons of sugar. 

“Ah,” he said, tasting the first 
sip, “one lives again. At the Acad- 
emy was like heaven to drink cof- 
fee, Logan. Only once a day. And 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



coffee was from Turkey, you 
know. Once — ” 

“Better drink it fast,” I ad- 
vised. “I have to get back to 
work.” 

once four cooks drank coffee 
and died,” he went on. “Whole 
batch had to be thrown away, be- 
cause someone had put strychnine 
in it. Terrible.” He frowned remi- 
niscently. “A Turk? One imagines 
so. V/az terrible time — ” 

“Good-by, Semyon.” I threw 
my empty container in the waste- 
basket and stood up. • 

“—was terrible time when So- 
viets of Russia were surrounded 
by hostile nations. Now, of 
course — ” he shrugged —“it is 
greatly different. We are friend to 
all, what of us the Orientals left. 
Do you find this a lesson to you, 
Logan?” 

I held the door open for him. 
“I do, Semyon. Good-by.” 

TTE WINKED amiably at me 
as he left and I couldn’t help 
smiling. It was hard to realize 
that his country and mine had 
torn each other apart for the sal- 
vage of the splinters not much 
over a decade before, when Sem- 
yon was a fresh eighteen-year-old 
junior officer, straight out of the 
Academy into the Yugoslav Push 
that had touched off the Short 
War. That was Semyon’s first bat- 
tle — against Marshal Tito’s stub- 
born little army. 



And now he had named his dog 
in honor of his late enemy, the 
marshal, whose real name was 
Josip Broz. 

Semyon was a nuisance, but it 
was with a little disappointment 
that I realized, later on, that he 
hadn’t shown up for his ten 
o’clock coffee. And he didn’t show 
up at eleven and he was late, ac- 
tually late, for lunch. 

“Logan,” he explained sorrow- 
fully, staring without appetite at 
the plate the mess attendant put 
before him, “Josip is sick. Could 
someone have hurt him, Logan? 
He is bleeding and he will not let 
me come near. Poor little dog, 
perhaps he has been in a fight. 
And he behaves oddly. I play 
with him and show him ' tricks, 
and he whines and hides under 
the desk and whines again.” He 
began to chew morosely. 

“Maybe you ought to call a 
vet.” 

“I did! Of course I did. And he 
said, ‘Terribly sorry, old man, but 
it will have to wait; we must 
scrub the cattle’s teeth for Com- 
mander Lineback first.’ And poor 
Josip, he is in pain.” 

It was silly, but he was wor- 
ried. He even left the table early, 
so that when I took the ’copter 
down to our area, it was without 
him and he missed all the excite- 
ment. 

Because, from .the ’copter, 
somebody saw a running figure in 



SLAVE SHIP 



109 



the palmettos, where nobody 
should have been running at all. 
We radioed back to Lineback’s 
administrative area and in less 
than ten minutes we encircled, 
closed in on and recaptured eight 
Caodai escapees roasting the car- 
cass of a pig over an open fire. 

There were three more pig car- 
casses in the clearing; the prison- 
ers must have worked like de- 
mons to get the animals driven 
off the research area while most 
of us were at lunch. The security 
guard hadn’t noticed a thing — no 
doubt because the security guard, 
relaxed and happy with the sure 
knowledge that nobody would 
ever bother a place like Project 
Mako, was sound asleep under a 
palm. 

¥ INEBACK said ruefully: “I 
^ guess that’s the end of the 
Pig section of the project. But 
what bothers me is the radio.” 

It wasn’t much of a radio — the 
sort of thing that prisoners some- 
how smuggle in, piece by piece, 
but it could easily have reached 
out past the horizon to where a 
Caodai ship might be lurking, 
barely awash. 

Somebody snickered and Line- 
back turned on him sharply. “Be- 
lay that! Mako might be funny 
to you and maybe it’s even funny 
to me. But it isn’t funny to CO- 
MINCH, because he classified it 
Most Secret and he isn’t going to 

110 



like Caodais with radios roaming 
around it.” 

“But, Commander,” ventured 
Kedrick, “these guys were just 
looking for something to eat. 
They wouldn’t have raided the 
pigs if they’d been after bigger 
stuff.” 

“Tell COMINCH,” said Line- 
back shortly. “In fact, that’s an 
order — get it dispatched at once.” 

Semyon wasn’t exactly disap- 
pointed at missing the excitement, 
when I dropped in his section to 
tell him about it. He had other 
things on his mind. “Is very bad 
with Josip,” he told me worriedly. 
“Look!” 

All I could see was a slack tail 
sticking out from under a chair. 
I said, not too tactfully: “You’re 
lucky. The Pig section is worse 
off than you. The Caodais ate 
them up.” 

I had his full attention. “What?” 
he demanded. 

I had to tell him all about the 
Caodai escapees again. He kin- 
dled like a rocket. 

“Curse them!” he raved. “I see 
it, I see it! They come here to de- 
stroy us, Logan! They eat the 
pigs, they hurt my little dog, 
heaven only knows what damage 
they do to the other stock! Call 
Lineback, Logan! Get him here. 
No, give me that phone — I will 
do this myself!” 

And he did, he got Lineback 
there in a matter of minutes. It 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sounded preposterous, of course, 
to me and no doubt to Lineback. 
Stilk the Caodais had been in the 
area and it was at least something 
of a coincidence that one of our 
experimental animals ■ should be 
in trouble just then. And Josip 
was in trouble. Semyon managed 
• briefly to cdax the* dog: into his 
lapf but Josip wasn’t happy there. 

■ . He looked' up at us with eyes as 
big and unhappy as Seniyon’s. 

• I said uncertainly:: “Maybe — ;

and moaned and scurried, whin- 
ing fretfully, under a desk. 

Y THE time Lineback got 
there, Semyon had worked up 
a storm against the Orientals 
and he blasted his commanding 
officer with demands for the in- 
stant arrest of every Caodai 
within reach on grounds of espi- 
onage, sabotage and treason. 

“Easy, Timayazev!’' rapped 
Lineback. “What’s the story?” 

“I am telling it you!” cried 
Semyon. “My dog has been sabo- 
taged — wounded! Do not believe 
me. I am only a Russian, a dirty 
foreigner. Do not take my word! 
But see for yourself!’ 



He gestured dramatically at 
the desk. 

Lineback looked at us wor- 
riedly for a moment. “Oh, hell,” 
he sighed. “The things this Navy 
makes me do — you say the dog’s 
back there?” 

“I say it!” 

Lineback reluctantly got down 
; on his hands and knees, had a 
sudden thought, hesitated and 
looked at us. , 

> ■ . “Is he vicious?” - 
5 i!‘jQsip? Vicious?” Semyon with- 
ered- Lineback with an unbpliev- 
i. ing look. 

• “All right,” said Lineback pla- 
catingly and put his head down to 
the floor to look under the desk. 
He suddenly jerked his head up 
and stared at us, then bent again 
and reached underneath. 

“Do not hurt Josip!”' Semyon 
warned sharply. “He is ill. He has 
been hurt—” 

Lineback’s expression was un- 
readable. He pulled something 
out from under the desk and held 
it out to us. 

“Mouse!” gasped Semyon. 
“Poor Josip, he has caught a 
mouse!” 

Lineback shook his head slowly. 
Then he looked down at the little 
animal in his very gently cupped 
hands. 

“Not exactly a mouse,” he said 
at last. “It’s what we call a puppy. 
Josip, my innocent friend, has just 
given birth to it.”

T INEBACK was broody, wor- 
ried about the possibility of 
Caodai transmission from the lit- 
tle radio the escapees had, I sup- 
pose, but he was also rather 
strained in his relations with 
Semyon and me. You can’t blame 
him. He came to his position as 
head of Project Mako by the ani- 
mal-husbandry route and he must 
have been astonished to find how 
little we animal experts knew 
about animals. 

I don’t say it was punishment, 
but the next time the officers’ 
extra-duty roster was posted, 
Semyon and I were prominent on 
it: To assist Project Veterinary 
Officer, it said after our names. 
Of course “extra duty” is defined 
as that which you do after all 
your regular duties are well taken 
care of. That meant I spent the 
time from 0800 to 1600 running 
my RAGNAROK while Semyon 
worked with his dogs — including 
Josip, now renamed Josie, and 
her pups. Then, promptly after 
dinner, we reported to the veteri- 
narian’s office for a pleasant eve- 
ning’s relaxation. 

And the veterinarian handed 
us a small box of thermometers 
with which we were to perform 
our duties. 

It was, I told Serriyon later on 
in the milkshed, la lousy way to 
fight a cold war. 

112 



“Cattle!” complained Semyon. 
“If it could be only at least a dog, 
which I know well, you under- 
stand, and like . But cattle!” 

For all his grousing, Semyon 
was not unhappy with the job, so 
I turned the temperature-taking 
segment of it over to him and my- 
self took the daily check-chart to 
record his findings. It was, I re- 
minded myself,, important work; 
Lineback had said so himself, too 
important to entrust to enlisted 
men. 

But it didn’t seem like im- 
portant work. I wondered what 
Elsie would think if she saw me 
squatting soberly on a bale of hay, 
while the world crept closer to the 
point of ignition. 

Elsie. I stared out at the bril- 
liant white moon that, ten hours 
before, had been shining on Elsie, 
and I missed my wife very much. 

“Logan! I have been talking to 
you!” 

“Sorry, Semyon.” He was look- 
ing worried; he waved the ther- 
mometer at me. 

“Three of them, Logan! I exam- 
ine three cattle and they are hot. 
Epidemic, no? So I examine two 
more and they are hot, too!” 

I looked at the chart. It was 
true — I had written it myself but 
had hardly noticed what I was 
writing. Semyon had taken the 
temperature of five cows and they 
all hovered a bit over a hundred 
degrees. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I said: “It’s not much of a 
fever, Semyon — ” 

“Call Lineback.” 

“But, listen, Semyon — ” 

“Call Lineback!” 

T CALLED Lineback, getting 
-*■ him out of a pleasant bridge 
game at the club. “Sir, we’ve got 
some sick cattle here. They all 
have fevers, every one of them.” 
And Semyon was chattering over 
my shoulder about the Orientals 
and secret germ weapons. Line- 
back sounded mad, but he prom- 
ised to come right over. 

And he did, with the veterinary 
officer at his side. And that is 
when I first learned that the nor- 
mal temperature of a healthy cow 
is not 98-plus degrees, but a hun- 
dred and one. 

It was still a brilliant full moon 
as Semyon and I limped back to 
quarters, nursing our wounds, but 
I wasn’t enjoying it. Commander 
Lineback had been pretty rough 
on us. 

“Ah, well,” said Semyon philo- 
sophically, “at least we do not 
have that detail any more.” 

I told him to shut up. But grad- 
ually I was soothed. The clouds, 
white and fleecy in the moonlight; 
a mutter of thunder from over the 
Gulf Stream; a gentle, warm wind 
— it was pleasant. 

I sighed. Semyon looked around 
at me. “You are thinking of your 
wife?” 



“What?” I started to shake my 
head, but then I realized it was 
true — not with the top of my 
mind, no, but deep inside. “It’s 
been a long time,” I said. 

“Two years? That is not so ter- 
ribly long.” 

“It’s long enough for me,” I 
said shortly. “I wouldn’t mind so 
much if I were doing anything to 
shorten it.” 

We walked along for a moment, 
but the night was no longer so 
pleasant. 

“The trouble is not hearing 
anything,” I told him after a mo- 
ment. “No letters. No more esp- 
ing — Lineback’d put me in irons 
if I tried it again.” 

“Terrible,” he agreed, looking 
as sad as only a Russian can. 

“And no chance in the world of 
ever getting anywhere near her. 
Semyon, that’s the worst thing! 
At least, when I was on the 
cruiser, there was always -the 
chance — ” 

“Lieutenant Moeller?” 

It was a runner from the com- 
mander’s staff, peering at us 
through the moonlight. 

“Yes?” 

“Commander's compliments,” 
he said breathlessly, “and will you 
report to him at the milkshed on 
the double?” » 

“Oh-oh,” said Semyon. We 
looked at each other. What was 
Lineback doing back at the milk- 
shed? 



SLAVE SHIP 



113 



There was only one way to find 
out. We went back to the shed — 
perhaps not exactly on the double, 
but near enough to it so that we 
were both breathing hard. 

Lineback, the vet and a couple 
of other officers were a circle of 
bobbing torches in the darkness 
— not in the shed, but behind it, 
gathered around — a sick cow? 
Something on the ground, any- 
way. 

I couldn’t quite see. 

EDRICK flashed his light in 
my face. “Moeller, take a 
look.” For once, he wasn’t fussy, 
he wasn’t an old maid. His torch 
shone on what was on the ground. 

It wasn’t a cow. It was a man. 
Or, at any rate, it had been. 

“Oswiak,” I said. But it wasn’t 
easy to recognize him; the chin, 
the throat, one whole side of the 
jawline all were scarred and tor- 
tured. He was dead and he hadn’t 
died easily. “The Glotch.” 

“The Glotch,” said Kedrick. 
“You were here before. Any ideas 
about this?” 

The only idea I had was to get 
away from that face. It reminded 
me of how close I had come, back 
in Miami. 

I said so. 

Lineback sighed heavily and I 
could hear him scratching his long 
jaw in the darkness. “So they’ve 
spotted Mako,” he said. “Some- 
body’s going to catch bloody blue 

114 



hell for this. Well, let’s get him to 
the sickbay, you medics.” 

I didn’t stop in the wardroom, 
I went right to bed; but not im- 
mediately to sleep. Oswiak’s face 
was too clear before me. 

I’ve seen dead men more times 
than one. I’ve been close enough 
to dying myself — not only in 
Miami, not only in the action 
after the stockade break, but on 
Spruance. 

But Oswiak had been burned 
and there is something especially 
repellent about a man who has 
died of burns, yards from any- 
where, in the middle of a healthy, 
unsinged stand of crabgrass. It 
wasn’t natural; it wasn’t — well, 
decent. 

I swore at Semyon when he 
tried to wake me for breakfast 
and slept right through until he 
came back to the rogm just be- 
fore lunch. By then, of course, 
he knew as much as I did — he 
and all the rest of Project Mako, 
all the more because Commander 
Lineback had put out an order- 
of-the-day placing the whole sub- 
ject under top-secret classifica- 
tion. 

Naturally, that insured that 
every officer and rating on the 
project had to find out just what 
it was that was secret. But it 
made it possible for me to duck 
discussing it with Semyon, who 
had a somber interest in such 
matters. 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I T WASN’T much of a work- 
day for me. I went down to 
my workroom after lunch, but I 
wasn’t there half an hour when 
the usual rating appeared with 
the usual compliments-and-get- 
the-devil-down-here from Line- 
back. 

This time, for a novelty, he 
seemed almost sympathetic. “I’ve 
been talking to COMCARIB. 
You’re in trouble, Moeller.” 

“Yes, sir,” I said. 

“That’s nothing new, eh? Well, 
you’re right. I’ve had you on this 
carpet before about using Giar- 
dano to get in touch with your 
wife and that’s what you’re in 
trouble about today. However, 
I’m sorry to say that you’re in a 
little niore trouble now.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“You damned young fool!” he 
exploded. “How does it feel to 
know that you’ve killed a man, 
Moeller?” 

That startled me. 

“Killed - ” 

“Or the next thing to it. You 
saw him last night — Oswiak, with 
his throat burned out.” 

“That’s not fair. Commander! 
I 

“Shut up, Moeller.” He got 
control of himself. “You didn’t do 
anything on purpose, no. In fact, 
you don’t do much on purpose 
ever, do you? You blunder into 
things. Like you blundered into 



this one — and killed off a CPO.” 

He added moodily: “Ah, the 
hell with it. I just called you in 
here to tell you what COM- 
CARIB said. If those burns are 
a Caodai secret weapon — there’s 
small doubt of it, Moeller — 
there’s evidence that they are 
linked with ESP transmission. 
From Project Mako, I guaran- 
tee, there has been absolutely no 
ESP transmission. Except once 
— not from here, but from Miami, 
when I didn’t have my eyes on 
you for a moment — and that 
transmission was from you.” 

^ I 'HERE was more. He reamed 
me out and through and up 
and down, but it didn’t hurt very 
much because I was numb. I did 
not enjoy the thought that, how- 
ever stupidly and unwittingly, I 
had helped the Cow-dyes kill an 
American. 

there won’t be any court- 
martial,” he was saying and I 
focused on him again. “But you 
deserve it, Moeller, and I want 
you to know that from here until 
you leave this base, I’m watch- 
ing you.” 

That seemed to be that. I said, 
“Yes, sir,” automatically, and 
saluted, and turned to leave. 

But he wasn’t quite through. 
“One more thing,” he said, his 
expression unreadable. “I picked 
up a piece of information that 
you might be interested in. You 



SIAVE SHIP 



115 



were on Spruance before you 
came here, weren’t you?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Then you might be interested 
to know that this burning gizmo 
the Caodais have has just been 
tested out on a submerged vessel. 
The Caodais are probably pretty 
happy, because, according to a 
burst transmission COMCARIB 
intercepted, it works. The whole 
engineering section of the sub 
died at once and the sub hasn’t 
been heard from since.” He looked 
at me levelly. “It was Spruance, 
Moeller.” 

I had thought I was numb, 
but I wasn’t numb enough. I was 
out in the anteroom, ignoring 
Giardano sitting there reproach- 
fully, waiting for his own turn 
under the lash, before it occurred 
to me to wonder if I had saluted. 

Spruance was sunk. 

And I was tending cows and 
pushing buttons in a featherbed 
project ashore. 

T here had been big doings 
down in the bay for a couple 
of weeks, but we had been warned 
to keep our noses out of it. Some- 
thing had been floated in on a 
moonlit night, guarded by a patrol 
boat, convoyed by two little 
Diesel tugs; and a huge tarpaulin 
tent had been erected over it, 
and Navy mechanics had been 
hammering at it day and night. 

116 



They weren’t our own mechanics; 
they were flown in in shifts, and 
flown out again, even for mess. 

Semyon and I strolled down 
one evening after work, but a 
husky seaman with a rifle leaned 
out of a cluster of palmettos and 
halted us. We didn’t argue; I 
heard the snick of the bolt on 
his rifle, and we turned around 
and went home. 

“Very silly procedure,” Sem- 
yon said angrily. “They might 
have shot us!” 

“I think they would have,” I 
said. The seaman had looked very 
businesslike. 

“Barbarous!” raged Semyon. 
“In Irkutsk, such a thing would 
not be. Ah, Logan, you Ameri- 
cans have not yet learned the 
proper conduct of a war. In 
Krasnoye Armee, when I was a 
cadet at the Suvorov Academy 
and — ” 

“I’ve heard,” I said. “And what 
is Krasnoye Armee doing these 
days?” 

“Oh, granted!” Semyon agreed 
cheerfully. “You beat the ears 
from us; we lost. True. But, Lo- 
gan, we lost so well!” 

“Let’s go into town,” I said 
disgustedly. 

We took a ’copter to Boca 
Raton and wandered around at 
loose ends. “Let us visit the Pas- 
sion Pit,” Semyon suggested 
eagerly. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Why not?” It wasn’t my idea 
of a big evening, but I admittedly 
didn’t have any better ideas to 
suggest. Besides, I had been a 
long time away from Elsie, but 
not quite long enough to be 
looking for another girl, and in 
spite of its name, the Passion Pit 
was about the most innocuous 
sf>ot in town. They didn’t even 
have a license. If you wanted to 
get high in the Passion Pit, you 
brought your own poison. 

Vj^E PAID our admission fee, 
” stood still while the atten- 
dant stamped our foreheads with 
fluorescent ink — so that we 
could walk in and out, if we 
wished, without being accused 
of crashing the place free; the 



SLAVE SHIP 



117 



UV spotlight at the door showed 
who had paid admission and who 
ivas merely hopeful of getting in 
for free — and sat down to watch 
the floor show. 

“We should have brought a 
couple of shots,” Semyon grum- 
bled. “It is not fun, just sitting 
here. If I wish to see cows cavort, 
there are plenty at Proj — ” 

“Shut up.” It wasn’t only that 
I wanted to keep him from men- 
tioning Project Mako by name, 
though we’d had pretty stiff 
orders about that, but the chorus 
girls were near enough to hear 
and one of them was glaring 
at us. 

“All right. But we should have 
brought a couple of shots.” 

T shrugged. Semyon didn’t pop 

and I didn’t drink — we’d had 
arguments about it — but there 
wasn’t any sense discussing it 
with him. Anyway, the Pit was 
filling up and if we went out for 
a shot, we wouldn’t be likely 
to get our seats back. 

The Passion Pit wasn’t any- 
thing like a pit, really. It was on 
the beach, looking out over the 
ocean. 

Only the size of it and the 
way the crowd acted on a busy 
night gave it its name. I suppose 
seventy-five people could have 
fitted into it comfortably. On a 
dull Monday, it usually held a 
hundred. The tables were more 



than merely close; they almost 
touched each other, and where 
you fitted in your chairs was 
your own problem. 

Semyon nudged me and point- 
ed. 

He had a thunderhead scowl 
and I saw why. Over against the 
wall, decorously eating in the 
midst of the uproar, ignoring the 
band blaring in their ears and 
the chorus line kicking past their 
noses, sat Commander Lineback 
and a dowdy middle-aged Wave 
jaygee. 

“Even here, he follows us!” 
hissed Semyon. 

“Don’t mind him,” I said. 
“Who’s the woman?” 

Semyon pursed his lips. “You 
have never met the officer his 
wife? A very charming lady — 
almost as charming as this who 
comes now!” 

He swiveled his chair around, 
eyes gleaming, completely for- 
getting about the commander and 
his wife. The feature stripper of 
the evening was making her ap- 
pearance. She was new, but I 
had heard of her — she was actu- 
ally a commissioned officer, which 
meant talent a good cut above 
the usual level of the Passion 
Pit, most of whose entertainers 
were lucky to make CPO. I 
flagged a waiter and ordered beer 
— the best you could do in the 
Pit — and sat back to enjoy my- 
self. 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



118 



But the three-piece “orches- 
tra” had just begun the slow, 
deep-beat number that the strip- 
per worked to when fireworks 
began going off outside. Sirens 
blared and search beams lashed 
the sky, and shots and signal 
rockets and more commotion than 
New Year’s Eve in a madhouse. 

Semyon said something startled 
and violent in Russian and we 
craned our necks to see out the 
window. 

Something was going on 

down at the beach, but we 
could not see precisely what. 
“Let us go look,” Semyon pro- 
posed gleefully. “Perhaps they 
have caught a patchifist.” 

“Pacifist. But I just ordered a 
beer and the show — ” 

“Logan, there is no show,” he 
said severely. He was right; the 
stripper was standing at the win- 
dow, staring out, and the musi- 
cians were right behind her. It 
was more exciting outside the 
Passion Pit than in, at that. Half 
the population of the town seemed 
to be beating the waterfront. “Let 
us look!” 

We joined the throng beating 
its way down to the scene of the 
excitement. It was a fine, warm 
night, smelling of hibiscus and de- 
caying palms, not fitting for so 
much turmoil. 

“Patchifist, patchifist!” Semyon 
was bawling. 



Whether he was the first to 
have the idea or not, I cannot 
say, but in a moment it seemed 
that the whole town was scream- 
ing: “Lynch the dirty pacifists! 
String ’em up!” 

It was a frightening exhibition 
of mob violence, erupting out of 
nothing, driving remorselessly to 
a bloody goal. I had seen a lynch- 
ing like this one once before, back 
in upstate New York, when ten 
square miles of countryside con- 
verged to dip one man by his 
heels into his own cistern. It 
turned out later that the original 
trouble had been over land and 
the man was no more a pacifist 
than you or I, only a queer, mor- 
ose sort of recluse from the city, 
but that must have been little 
enough consolation to him when 
the rope broke. 

Not that I doubted that paci- 
fists, and dangerous ones, really 
existed, but there had been no 
pacifist up there in Barton. 

And there was none here. The 
crowd surged to the water’s edge 
and stopped. 

In a writhing heap on a bag- 
gage cart, covered with a blanket, 
was a casualty of the cold war. A 
medical Army colonel was beside 
him,, methodically injecting a 
series of drugs into an arm that 
was held by two sick-faced men. 
The injured man was unconscious 
and he wasn’t screaming, but he 
was in pain. 



SLAVE SHIP 



119 



Someone in authority was 
questioning the colonel. The me- 
dic shrugged without looking up. 
“I don’t know,” he said. “Obste- 
trics is my specialty, but I think 
he’ll be all right. No, I don’t 
know what did it. He was on 
harbor patrol, es — ” 

He looked up and a curtain 
descended over his face. “You’ll 
have to ask somebody else,” he 
said shortly. He waved at the 
fireworks out over the water. 
“They’ve found something, that’s 
all I know.” 

They had found it, all right; 
there were more light Navy ves- 
sels, mostly high-speed hydrofoils, 
skimming over the water than I 
had seen since the Fleet exercises. 
The show went on for half an 
hour before we found out just 
what it was that they had dis- 
covered. 

'■ I ■’HEY brought him iri on an 
airscrew hydrofoil, zooming 
up to the landing, stopping short 
as the screws were reversed, sink- 
ing down on the foils to its hull- 
lines just at the dock — a real 
hot-pilot operation. Semyon and 
I had pulled rank to get unto 
the landing itself and we were 
right there when the hydrofoil’s 
crew handed him up. 

He was a little fellow, not 
more than five-two or there- 
abouts, brown-skinned and olive- 
eyed. He was dead. He wore 

120 



breathing gear and frog flippers 
on his feet, and around his waist 
was a whole assembly line of 
weapons and equipment. 

It was the first Caodai I had 
ever seen dead in that way. But 
it was not the first body I had 
seen, pitted and scarred, looking 
like the bottom man on a pile 
of football players, run over by 
a team with white-hot cleats on 
their shoes. When I saw the 
wounds on the Caodai frogman’s 
back and neck, I knew what had 
been wrong with the injured man 
at the waterfront. He had lived, 
but the Caodai had not, any more 
than the CPO at Mako had. 

Secret weapon? But if the 
Caodais owned it, how had it de- 
stroyed one of their own men? 

We never did go back to the 
Passion Pit. It didn’t seem like 
a good idea any more. We went 
home and to bed; and the next 
morning. Commander Lineback 
had me in his office again. 

“I saw you on the raft last 
night, Moeller,” he began heavily 
and I braced myself for what 
might be coming. He passed a 
hand over his face. “I don’t know, 
boy,” he said querulously. “I don’t 
think there’s anything wrong with 
you. Heaven knows I don’t think 
you’re a Cow-dye spy or any- 
thing like that, but why is it 
that whenever anything goes 
wrong, you’re always right there 
on the scene?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Sir, Lieutenant Timayazev 
and I were in the Pa — ” 

“I know. I saw you.” He shook 
his head and said kindly: “Look, 
Moeller, will you just try to stay 
out of trouble for a while? I’ve 
got work for you.” 

“Yes, sir, but — ” 

“Forget it.” He pressed a but- 
ton and a rating came in with 
what looked like an old-fashioned 
pilot’s helmet, one of those close- 
fitting things with earflaps that 
the old open-cockpit boys wore 
as a badge of office, except that 
this one seemed to be woven of 
shiny aluminum. 

“Try it on,” the commander in- 
vited. “It’s for you.” 

T put it on without Comment. 

It squeezed my ears a little, 
but it wasn’t too bad. Lineback 
half smiled. “It doesn’t do much 
for your looks,” he observed. 
“We’ll see if it helps keep you 
alive.” 

“Alive, sir?” 

“You saw that Cow-dye last 
night.” 

I swallowed and looked at the 
helmet again, turning it over in 
my hands. 

“Put it back on,” he ordered 
sharply. “Until further notice, 
you’ll wear it twenty-four hours 
a day, every day, all day. That’s 
an order.” 

I put it back on. “Why me, 
sir?” 



The commander lit a cigarette 
and waved out the match. “I 
think I told you that the weapon 
is linked with ESP. You’ve been 
esp-sensitized. Every victim so 
far has been sensitized. COM- 
CARIB thinks that means that 
if you haven’t been sensitized, 
you aren’t susceptible to the Cow- 
dye weapon — whatever it is. 
You’ll find a lot of these hats on 
the project, starting today. You’re 
the first.” 

“Thanks,” I said. He glanced 
at me and I added, “Sir.” 

He said mildly, “You did see 
see that Cow-dye, didn’t you?” 

I had, and if the aluminum hat 
would keep me from looking like 
that, I would wear the aluminum 
hat. But something was bother- 
ing me. “If it’s a Caodai weapon, 
sir, how come it hit him?” 

Lineback shrugged. “Maybe 
COMCARIB knows, but if so, they 
haven’t seen fit to inform me. All 
I know is that a seaman on harbor

hurt. Anyway, they’re dragging— 
in five hundred feet of water, so 
don’t hold your breath till they 
find anything.” Lineback shook 
himself. “Enough of this conver- 
sation. I said I’ve got work for 
you.” 

I assumed a posture of atten- 
tion. “Yes, sir!” I said, trying to 
look as military as possible. A 
new batch of animal bright say- 
ings to process through the com- 
puter, I thought, or perhaps some 
pleasant little additional duty 
with the thermometers. If I had 
to take that sort of thing to stay 
in the Navy, I would take it, 
but at *least I would try to be 
shipshape about it. I leaned for- 
ward and picked up the sealed 
orders Lineback flipped across 
the desk to me. 

But it wasn’t like that at all. I 
opened the envelope and stared 
in utter disbelief. 

I was ordered to assume com- 
mand of a sea-going fighting ship! 

For a moment, I felt as though 
I were in the real honest-to-John- 
Paul-Jones Navy again. 

"DUT only for a moment, be- 
cause when Semyon and I 
raced down to examine my new 
command, we discovered that 
there had been a few little modi- 
fications. 

MHV Weems was a deep-sea 
heavy monitor, six thousand tons 
displacement, nuclear - powered. 



armed with twenty homing-tor- 
pedo tubes and damned little 
else. Weems was an elderly lady 
by the time COMCARIB turned 
her over to me, but monitors of 
her class had served well and 
damagingly to the enemy in a 
great many actions, and she still 
could have been a command 
worth having — especially for a 
jay-gee. 

However, COMCARIB’s engi- 
neers had performed a sort of 
crude hysterectomy on the old 
girl. 

She didn’t look much differ- 
ent, under the tarpaulin tent, but 
her torpedo racks were empty, 
the tubes were plugged with steel 
disks, and far-reaching changes 
had been made in her propulsion 
system. 

For one thing, four inches of 
sheathing had. been stripped from 
her reactor. It made a nice econ- 
omy in weight — Weems, from 
a lumbering snail of a vessel, 
could now in theory lope along 
as lightly as a corvette — but it 
had the one drawback that every- 
body inside her hull was subject 
to a wash of radiation all the 
time the reactor was going. 

Semyon looked at-,me with the 
roundest of eyes. “Logan, are they 
making a Kamikaze of you?” 

“Of us,” I said, grimly enjoying 
myself. “You’re part of my crew.” 

“I am not!” he yelped. “In 
Krasnoye Armee, is never — ” 



122

“It’s all right,” I assured him. 
“Relax. In the first place, this old 
wagon isn’t going anywhere. In 
the second place, if it did, and 
you and I went with it, we would 
live up forward in a sealed whale- 
boat. When the reactor was on, 
we’d be behind a six-inch bulk- 
head. The only communication 
we would have with the main 
compartments would be over 
intercoms.” 

He meditated. "Otchi khora- 
shaw,” he announced. “Is all 
right.” He patted the heavy tube- 
loading gear, still in place be- 
cause it was too clumsy to take 
out. “It not bad, this Weems,” he 
said thoughtfully. “And you are 
commander. I congratulate you, 
Logan.” 

We toured the ship like mid- 
shipmen on their first training 
cruise. Semyon was delighted 
with the happy combination of 
sea and shore duty. We would 
spend our working days on 
Weems, sleep in our quarters 
ashore, have our evenings free for 
the Passion Pit. He had it all 
figured out — 

Almost all. 

f I ■'HE whaleboat which would 
nominally be our quarters 
was comfortable enough, though 
not large. It was similar in design 
to the scout torpedoes I had piloted 
when I was attached to Spruance, 
but not as fast and not armed. 



Its whole function was to get a 
part of the crew away in case 
the monitor was crippled or 
breached. 

There were quarters for three: 
A “captain’s cabin” — mine — 
the principal distinction of which 
was a curtain to draw across the 
bunk, and two uncurtained bunks 
fitted around the main drive 
shaft. It would be a little cramped 
on an extended cruise, but livable. 

Something was troubling Sem- 
yon. We tramped aft from the 
sealing hatch to the whaleboat 
and he cast puzzled looks at the 
main control board, the fire-con- 
trol panel, the complicated fight- 
ing gear of a deep-sea monitor. 
COMCARIB’s engineers had been 
busiest here. 

Most of the panel had been 
made fully automatic, run off a 
modified baby computer; what 
little could not be automatized 
had been redesigned. Pushbut- 
tons had been replaced with big, 
soft-handled throw switches. In- 
finite-range microverniers had 
been ripped out and simple on- 
off two-position toggles put in 
their place. There could be little 
grace or flexiblity in operating 
Weems with the new controls; 
power ahead would be “Full” or 
“Dead Stop” and rudder wbuld 
be hard right or amidships. 

But it would go. 

Semyon started to ask me a 
question a couple of times, but

frowned and stopped himself each 
time. It was only when we came 
to where the crew quarters should 
have been that he exploded.

no galley on this Weems, Logan?” 
“You can flgure it out,” I told 
him. “You realize this whole area 
of the ship would be awash with 
radiation in action.” 

“Of course! That is why I ask, 
Logan!” 

“Everything so simple, even a 
child could operate it. Maybe 
even less than a child, Semyon.” 
He was staring at me. “Now per- 
haps you know what Project 
Mako was all about.” 

I held out the orders and he 
took them unbelievingly. He

in the pool up in the Project area, 
but if Weems or anything like 
Weems ever put to sea, she would 
go along. 

On an actual strike, it wouldn’t 
be both the dogs and the apes, 
but one group or the other. In

our dry run, one of our principal 
missions was to find out which 
could operate a submarine better. 
The apes had manual dexterity, 
which was helpful, but in the

that the dogs had more tolerance

might be more important.

within range of the reactor meant

going to blow every fish, whale 
and dolphin that came within 
range of their sonars out of the 
water — and our seal would look 
like any other seal, except for 
what she carried. It was extreme- 
ly doubtful that they could recog- 
nize that in time to do them 
much good.

Working with the seal, in fact, 
was child’s play. All we had to 
do was to run through enough of 
a vocabulary to explain to her 
that if she swam to the object 
that was shown to her and pushed 
the big metal disk, she would get 
a fish — and prove it to her with 
a few fish. 

She would be one surprised 
seal, though, when she pushed the 
big metal disk in an actual oper- 
ation. 



dently the burns were causing 
more trouble than the newspapers 
reported. 

And by then, of course, the 
reason for the helmets was an 
open- secret. 

Semyon’s feelings were hurt. 
“I have not enough brain then? 
The Orientals cannot vector in 
on the little brain of Semyon 
Timayazev, the son of a disciple 
of Pavlov? Hah!” 

He was moody about it for 
days, until we got a shipment of 
helmets of a new size and shape. 
Then he was utterly crushed — 
the new helmets were for our 
dogs. 

I tried to explain to him that 
it was a matter of ESP sensi- 
tivity, not intellect, that our work 
with the dogs might have made 
them susceptible. But you can- 
not tell a Russian anjrthing once 
he gets an idea fixed in his brain, 
and for some little time after 
that, Semyon was of no use to 
Project Mako. All he could do 
was stare unhappily at the dogs. 

But the work proceeded. 

I pushed myself pretty hard, 
because along about the time I 
got my first command, I received 
a letter from the Red Cross. 

“Lieutenant Moeller,” they said, 
“we regret to inform you in an- 
swer to your request of 28 June 
that we are unable to establish 
contact with Elsie NMI Moeller, 
Signalman 2/C, last known to be 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



S EMYON got a fit of the giggles 
every time he saw me trying 
to take a shower with my alu- 
minum helmet on my head. On 
Lineback’s orders, I kept my 
mouth shut about what it was 
for, but as Lineback had prom- 
ised, they began cropping up all 
over the base before long. Ked- 
rick was the second man to turn 
up with one; then three or four 
of the other officers, including 
the Waves; then the enlisted per- 
sonnel — apparently on the prin- 
ciple that they were compara- 
tively expendable. 

My own Wave appeared at 
the keyboard of the computer one 
morning with a feminine-styled 
model perched on the back of 
her head. It was smaller than 
mine, apparently a later issue — 
which, considering that mine was 
no more than three or four days 
old, indicated a pretty high prior- 
ity in project development. Ev.i-

ing her welfare, in line with your 
request. However, we must inform 
you that there is a backlog in ex- 
cess of fourteen hundred such ap- 
plications. None have been 
granted.” 

So I pushed myself hard and 
the animals and Semyon harder 
still. 

• 

hull of Weems began to 
smell like an old goat bam. 
“Trained, these animals!” Semyon 
complained bitterly. “They are 
not even houses-broken!” 

But that had little to do with 
their military occupational spe- 
cialty. The chimpanzees were 
named Clara and Kay, both fe- 
malesr both yoimg and friendly; 
they caught on to what we wanted 
of them quickly enough. It was 
a spectacular sight to see Semyon, 
vocabulary sheets in his hand, 
chattering and posturing at the 
apes, but it got results. 

I found out very quickly that 
there wasn’t any such thing as a 
conveasation with an ape. You 
could stand there and tell it the 
chimpanzee symbols for, “Loud- 
noise. Hurry. Grab-fhaf-thing. 
Pull,” and it would merely look at 
you, head cocked far over on one 



side, brown ape eyes staring va- 
cantly. And then it would scratch 
and scamper away. But then the 
crash-dive bell would sound and 
Clara or Kay would leap up from 
her flea-hunt and jerk open the 
manual main-tank valve as skill- 
fully as any twenty-year sub- 
mariner. 

I don’t mean to say that they 
never talked back — often they 
would object and tell us that they 
wanted a banana or a shiny ball 
or a handful of mealworms. But 
there was little predictability in 
their responses. 

The dogs were another matter 
entirely. Their main problem was 
gamilousness. You would explain 
to them, say, a complicated 
couijse-correction maneuver and 
they would bark, growl and sema- 
phor the whole thing back to you. 
And they wouldn’t repeat it just 
once; they would tell you the 
whole procedure two or three 
times, and then come up and put 
their forepaws on your legs and 
mention a couple of the high- 
spots, and tell you about the fire- 
control drill they had done the 
day before, with emphasis on how 
High-Shiny-Lever was not the 
same as Little-Thick-Lever, even 
though both of them had to be 
pulled sharply outward. 

Semyon was astonished. “Oh, 
that Mamushka should not see! 
Observe, Logan! They chat like 
diplomat’s wives!” 



SLAVE SHIP 



127 



I T was true enough; when we 
left them in a simulated aban- 
don-ship, retreating to the whale- 
boat and communicating with the 
animals in W'eems proper only 
through the telecom, they chat- 
tered at each other. Since a very 
large proportion of canine vocab- 
ulary is aromatic, that contrib- 
uted to the soggy state of Weem’s 
interior. Fortunately, those sec- 
tions of their vocabulary — though 
of paramount interest to the dogs 
— had nothing to do with ship- 
handling, so it wasn’t necessary 
for us to duplicate them. 

The biggest hitch in communi- 
cating from the whaleboat was 
that we were living a lie and we 
knew it. It was all very well to 
dry-run the animals from the 
whaleboat, in communication by 
means of the telecom, but in ac- 
tual combat we would not be so 
fortunate. Water bars micro- 
waves; communication is possible, 
but only by sonar beam, and that 
presents a real challenge to a 
telecom. 

But not one which COMCA- 
RIB refused. Early one morning, 
the engineers were back, ripping 
out all our communication equip- 
ment and replacing it with some- 
thing complicated and new. 
Semyon and I sat on the shore, 
playing with Josie’s puppies and 
waiting, and the whole business 
was noisily but speedily installed 
in an hour. 

128 



The engineer from COMCA- 
RIB mopped his brow and ex- 
plained it to us, sweating. “It’s a 
sonarvision installation and Flag 
Section thinks it ought to do for 
whatever kind of lash-up you guys 
have got here.” 

He looked puzzledly at Josie 
and at Semyon and shrugged. 
“Anyway, it’ll give you a two-way 
picture. But not instantaneous; it’s 
got a slow rate of scan and you 
can transmit about one full image 
every two seconds. There’s a lit- 
tle bell that rings when your pic- 
ture’s taken. The phosphdl-s in 
the picture tube — ” 

From there on, it got deep, but 
I understood. Instead of radio 
waves, which the sea would stop, 
this thing beamed sound waves, 
which the sea carried beautifully. 
But because of the slow speed of 
sound waves, apparently, we were 
confined to transmitting a series 
of stills instead of a movie. 

When I pounded it through 
Semyon’s head, after the engi- 
neers had left, he glowered at me. 
“But the essence, Logan,” he pro- 
tested, “the essence of the vocab- 
ulary is motion and — ” 

I patted him on the head. 
“Back to the computers,” I said, 
as kindly as I could. , 

W ELL, we worked it out and 
if we didn’t have perfect rap- 
port with the animals, there were 
compensations. With practice, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



they got almost good enough to 
ship-handle by themselves, any- 
how. 

The image in the sonarvision 
screen wasn’t terribly sharp, but 
by turning up the gain, we got a 
patchy sort of vivid light-and- 
dark silhouette that looked awful 
to me, but which the dogs and 
apes had no trouble recognizing. 
The only thing was, they couldn’t 
seem to grasp the notion that the 
picture of Semyon was the same 
as the person of Semyon; they 
would take orders from Semyon 
in person, but the semaphoring 
stills only puzzled them. 

We ran picture-recognition tests 
for two whole days and Josie was 
the first of the dogs to begin to 
get the idea. I pointed to Semyon 
and announced his name; I 
pointed to the photo of Semyon 
the signal lab had made for us, 
as contrasty as the screen image, 
/ and named it; and Josie got up on 
her hind feet and leaped over to 
the photo and licked it. It was like 
winning the Battle of the Atlantic. 

“Good girl,” I said in English, 
because by the time we got the 
dogs, they had already acquired 
ten or twenty loan words, like any 
other reasonably intelligent mutt. 
And in Dog: “Now. This one. Do.” 

It was a photo of a cow. Josie 
stared at it thoughtfully for a mo- 
ment and then pronounced: 
“Big — ” Well, never mind what 
the Dog word for “cow” is. But 



she got it. I ran through a couple 
of dozen pictures and she called 
every one; and when I came to a 
photo of her puppies, she called 
each name and, barking the look- 
at-me symbol, rolled over on her 
back to display her swollen milk 
glands. 

I took a break, scratching the 
back of Josie’s neck and smoking 
a cigarette. She said the low, half- 
voice whine for “Bad smell” once, 
but only as a comment, not a re- 
proof, and she nudged my ciga- 
rette case indulgently with her 
nose. 

I picked it up and opened it. 
Elsie’s picture was inside the lid, 
taken two years before. I started 
to tell Josie that this was my wife, 
but somehow it didn’t seem right, 
translated into Dog, and I con- 
tented myself with showing her 
the picture. She looked at it a 
little dubiously, tongue lolling 
out, one paw on my knee. 

I didn’t think how odd that 
might look to anyone else until I 
heard Lineback’s voice, scratchy 
with scorn, from behind me say- 
ing: “What are you trying to do, 
Moeller, make her jealous?” 

T INEBACK went through 
Weems like a homing tor- 
pedo through a tube, and in that 
one half-hour inspection, there 
wasn’t a thing that Semyon and 
I had been doing that he didn’t 
touch on. He was wearing a sar- 



SLAVE SHIP 



129 



donic expression when he began,- 
but by the time he completed his 
tour and watched us put the ani- 
mals through a couple of simple 
paces, his face was serious and 
friendly. 

“Lieutenant Moeller, Lieuten- 
ant Timayazev,” he said, “well 
done. Now I’ve got a hard ques- 
tion for you. Do you think you 
can make this thing work in com- 
bat?” 

Semyon swallowed audibly. 

I said quickly: “Certainly, sir.” 

Lineback looked at me thought- 
fully. “You’re pretty salty,” he 
said and I couldn’t tell whether 
it was approbation or not. “Well, 
you may get the chance. You’ll 
have orders tomorrow.” He 
reached over to pat Sammy, our 
wire-hair. 

Sammy glanced at Semyon, 
who told him; “Boss. All right 
here.” 

Sammy whined. You could 
translate it as, “Well, if you say 
so,” and suffered Lineback to pat 
him. 

Lineback shook his head. “That 
business with your hands and the 
growl — you were talking to the 
pup.” 

“That is correct. Commander,” 
agreed Semyon proudly. “I trans- 
late it like so — ” 

“Never mind,” said Lineback. 
“I don’t know, it seems to me 
things were simpler before this 
idea got started.” Sammy was act- 



ing ill at ease, so Lineback let him 
go. “Dogs usually like me. Been 
getting along with animals all my 
life. I suppose once they get in 
the habit of conversation with 
humans, it changes their attitudes 
a little.” 

“That is so,” Semyon nodded 
eagerly. “One picks up a little of 
culture from the other; it is a 
phenomenon well known. You 
will find it in the papers of my 
mother, who worked with Pav- 
lov.” 

“No doubt,” said Lineback drily 
and got up to look for his hat. I 
got up with him; he had left the 
hat at A-Hatch and — 

“Sammy!” I yelled. The terrier, 
surprised in the act, looked 
around at me. I rescued the com- 
mander’s hat just in the nick of 
time. 

Commander Lineback, I will 
say for him, rose to the occasion. 
He looked at me for a speculative 
moment, then smiled slightly. “I 
see,” he said impassively. “Well, 
you won’t have to translate that 
for me. Good day, gentlemen.” 

And he left, leaving Semyon 
and me staring at each other in 
horror and relief. 

XI 

S O we found ourselves on or- 
ders. It wasn’t Lineback who 
handed them to us. It was a spe- 
cial courier-officer from a higher 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



command and it wasn’t even 
COMCARIB that wrote them, 
though it had COMCARIB’s hum- 
ble and instant endorsement. But 
the orders were signed “By com- 
mand of COMINCH” himself and 
the courier was a full commander 
of the line. 

Semyon was awed. “It is big, 
Logan,” he said portentously. 
“Did you observe? He shares your 
tastes in hats.” 

. “I observed,” I said. The com- 
mander had worn the aluminum 
skullcap under his regulation 
dress cap, a style which was be- 
coming fashionable. 

We broke the seal on our or- 
ders and read them hurriedly. 
They explained very little, only 
that we were detached from Proj- 
ect Mako as of 0800 the next 
morning and, were to proceed 
without delay to a port on the 
Florida Gulf coast for assign- 
ment. 

That was all my orders said. 
Semyon’s had one extra para- 
graph — directing him to bring 
with him certain “experimental 
animals covered by Reference 
COMINCH KT-41-611-MAKO 
and COMINCH KJA-41-184S- 
M AKO, specifically one ( 1 ) bitch, 
two (2) dogs, two (2) apes, 
small, female, and on3 (1.) seal.” 

The orders were headed MOST 
SECRET and consequently it was 
inevitable that everyone we saw 
on Project Mako stopped us to 



say good-by. We reported in to 
Commander Lineback, who made 
the most sensible suggestion of 
the day: “Go out and get drunk. 
It may be a long wait for the next 
time.” 

So we headed off base and 
wovmd up in the Passion Pit — but 
not, this time, without shots of 
our own. When the waiter finally 
made it to our table, Semyon or- 
dered ginger ale and I ordered 
chicken broth setups and we got 
set to enjoy the floor show. 

The stripper went through the 
whole act without interruption 
and I must say it was worth it. 
She was a lovely woman, golden- 
haired, blue-eyed, tall and 
shapely. She had a figure that no 
woman deserved and it was in- 
controvertibly natural; she went 
to some trouble to prove it. 

"OECAUSE Semyon made a 
point of those things, we 
were seated at ringside and he 
invited her to our table when she 
paused right in front of us near 
the end of her number. I was 
surprised she didn’t have us 
thrown out. I was even more sur- 
prised when, five minutes after 
she made her last bow, she 
showed up at our table. 

“Lovely,” said Semyon senti- 
mentally, looking at her costume. 
It was civilian clothing, rare 
enough on a young girl; you could 
see the fall-away zippers and clip-

pers that marked it as part of her 
professional wardrobe. “I have 
not seen many such dresses in 
your country. May we offer you 
a drink?” He reached for his flask 
as I reached for my case; we both 
held them out at the same time. 

“Thanks,” she said with a warm 
smile. “I’ll pop, please.” Semyon 
shook his head in sad resignation. 

“Mad,” he said. “However — 
waiter!” 

The waiter came over and took 
our orders — the same setups for 
Semyon and myself, beef bouillon 
for the girl. 

“My name,” she said, “is—” 
“Caresse O’Nuit,” said Semyon 
promptly. “I have seen the bill- 
boards.” 

. “But my name is Nina Mer- 
riam. Ensign, USWNR.” 

“Of course,” Semyon said hum- 
bly. “I am sorry, Nina. It is a 
much more lovely name.” 

“Which is?” 

“Nina Merriam.” 

“Is it?” She thought about it. 
“No, I think you’re wrong,” she 
decided. “But it’s my real name, 
so let’s use it, shall we?” 

Semyon said: “I would use any 

name that would bring you to

me. 

She looked at him. “Down, boy.” 
“Chicken broth,” said the 
waiter, arriving. “Ginger ale. And 
here’s your beef bouillon, Nina. 
Better take it easy; the old man’s 
out back.” 



“Don’t worry about me,” said 
Nina, and looked at me expec- 
tantly. I took out the case again 
and offered her a choice. She hesi- 
tated, then picked a flat green 
one. 

“They’re doubles,” I warned 
her. 

“So we’ll live a little.” She 
popped the pastille into her 
mouth and swallowed it expertly, 
dry. She sat for a moment before 
she took the first spoonful of the 
chaser. “Good stuff,” she said. 

T WAS feeling my first one by 
then, but after all, as Com- 
mander Lineback had said, it 
might be a long time before we 
had another chance to hoist a few. 
I took a double, too — but unlike 
sweet, blonde, young Nina Mer- 
riam, I had to wash it down with 
half the chicken broth. 

They say that you don’t really 
get any physical kick out of pop- 
ping for at least half an hour — it 
takes that long for the buildup. 
But I swear I get a tingle as soon 
as it slides down my throat. Call 
it psychological and maybe it is, 
but I can feel my temperature go 
up, I can see things begin to take 
on that lovely, fuzzy, dreamy 
look, I can feel that funny hot 
tingle go through my body. 

Semyon, of course, disapproved. 
He sat glumly sipping his Scotch 
and ginger and watched us. 
“Filthy custom,” he grumbled.

“Thank heaven is not found in 
Russia.” 

“They used to say the same 
thing about alcohol,” I said dream- 
ily. “ ’S just a poison, alcohol. 
Why would anybody want to poi- 
son himself?” 

“Be easy on him. Lieutenant,” 
Nina broke in, pushing away the 
balance of her chaser. “I kind of 
wish I could get as big a charge 
out of liquor as I do out of bios. 
I’m getting as fat as a pig on the 
chasers.” 

“Oh, no, no!" Semyon exclaimed 
at once, dropping the whole dis- 
cussion. “I have seen many pigs, 
Nina Merriam. Truly, there was 
none of them who was not much, 
much fatter than you.” 

“Thanks.” 

“You are welcome,” said Sem- 
yon proudly. “You have in no re- 
spect a figure like a pig’s. Observe 
that in hog, the middle section 
bulges out like watermelon. Your 
middle section is slim — two-hands 
slim, I estimate. Utterly unlike 
pig. I have covered waist; now I 
proceed upward. Pig—” 

“No, you don’t,” said the girl. 
“Forget about the pigs.” 

“Of course. But pig—” 

“I think pigs are dirty animalsl” 
Semyon giggled and slopped 
more Scotch into his glass. “So 
you say of pig,” he observed. “And 
pig says of ypu— ” And he told 
her, in Pig, what pigs called hu- 
mans. It was the same term they 



used for portions of their swill; it 
sounded like a hay-fever patient 
blowing his nose. 

The girl looked suddenly inter- 
ested. “I didn’t know you were a 
farmer,” she said. 

“Farmer? Timayazev is no 
farmer! Logan here and I, we—” 
“Semyon! Shut up!” I had been 
half asleep in my chair, dreamily 
listening to them, thinking how 
far aviay and curious everything 
was; but Semyon brought me to 
with a bang. 

TTE said angrily, “Do not shut 
me up, Logan! I was not go- 
ing to speak of Project Mako!” 
“You better not,” I told him 
and went back to examining my 
own sensations. 

I was beginning to see things 
through a haze. I looked down at 
the floor, where a cigarette was 
smoldering far, far away. It re- 
minded me to take a drag on my 
own cigarette, and when I raised 
my fingers to my lips, there was 
no cigarette in them. It posed an 
interesting problem. Cigarettes ap- 
peared from nowhere on the floor, 
cigarettes disappeared from my 
hands; it was all incomprehen- 
sible and suspicious. 

Was it possible that the Cao- 
dais were up to tricks with my 
cigarettes? I thought it over and 
rejected the possibility. The paci- 
fists, yes; that might be it. But it 
couldn’t be the Caodais, because 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



134 



they were too far away. It had to 
be pacifists. However, I had a 
plan to outwit them. It involved 
bending over and picking up the 
cigarette on the floor. It took a 
little thinking, but it was work- 
able; it would restore the balance. 

While I was figuring out the 
details, Nina Merriam said: “How 
about another round?” and the 
waiter appeared and disappeared, 
and new setups were on the table. 

“Logan,” Semyon was saying 
insistently. “Logan, why don’t you 
answer me?” 

“What is it that you would like 
an answer to?” I asked him care- 
fully. 

“I asked you if I might tell 
Nina about Josie’s puppies.” 

I touched my fingertips to- 
gether. “I see. You want to know 
if you can tell Nina about Josie’s 
puppies.” 

“That’s right.” 

“Don’t interrupt me, Semyon! 
I’m thinking.” I closed my eyes 
to concentrate. The problem had 
many ramifications and I couldn’t 
help wondering how Semyon had 
got onto that subject in the first 
place. Lineback would throw a 
tizzy if he knew that Semyon 
had so much as admitted he’d 
ever seen a dog. But Lineback, of 
course — 

“Logan!” Semyon sounded mad. 
“Wake up!” 

I opened my eyes and smiled 
at him forgivingly. 



“Well?” he demanded. “Can I 
or can I not?” 

“This is my verdict,” I an- 
nounced. I paused to frame the 
thing in exactly the right words. 

I was feeling a little woozy from 
the double shots, there was no de- 
nying it. Not only was I flushing 
hot all over, but I could feel my 
skin getting dry and my pulse 
thudding; it was time to take it 
easy for a while. I said carefully: 
“You can’t tell her about the pup- 
pies. You can tell her about Josie 
herself, all right, but you mustn’t 
mention talking to her, or the 
Weems.” 

S EMYON shook his head dis- 
gustedly. “Curse this secu- 
rity,” he said. 

“Don’t say anything about our 
shipping orders, either,” I warned 
him. 

“Of course not, Logan! Do you 
think I am a loose-tongue? Well, ' 
Nina, I cannot discuss the pup- 
pies, so do not ask me. I won’t 
do it.” 

I nodded approvingly and 
closed my eyes to listen better. 
This time, it was the girl who 
said, with a touch of irritation: 
“Wake up, Lieutenant Moeller. 
The chaser’s getting cold.” 

“Sorry,” I mumbled and found 
my case. She grabbed it, appar- 
ently under the impression that I 
was going to spill its contents. “No 
need to get excited,” I protested.

“You’ve only got one anthrax 
left. Maybe you’d better lay off 
for a while.” 

I sat up straight. “Help your- 
self,” I said cordially. “Officer of 
the line can mix his shots. Don’t 
expect girl to do as much.” 

She took the flat green pastille 
and swallowed it, making a face 
as she sipped the lukewarm bouil- 
lon. 

I took one at random and 
popped it. 

“Hey!” she cried, but I already 
had it down and was choking on 
the chicken broth. 

“You shouldn’t have done 
that,” Nina said worriedly. “Do 
you feel all right?” 

“I feel ferfect — perfectly fine.” 
It wasn’t entirely true and I 
avoided her eyes, not so much be- 
cause they were accusing as be- 
cause they were attached to her 
face, and her face was moving. I 
didn’t want to look at any moving 
objects just then. I stared at the 
ceiling, waiting for the slight 
tremor inside me to decide to go 
away. 

It didn’t. 

I took a really deep breath 
and sat up straight — it seemed 
hard to stay erect for any length 
of time — and smiled at Semyon 
and the girl. 

“Dance, Miss Merriam?” I in- 
vited. 

“There isn’t any music,” she 
pointed out. 

136 



T>UT Semyon responded, even 
if the girl was a spoilsport. 
His eyes jerked open. “Dance!” 
he said. “Timayazev will dance 
lesginka for you!” 

“Oh, no, you won’t,” said Nina 
Merriam, and between us we got 
him back in his chair. I had had 
only one more shot than the girl, 
but I was frankly reeling and she 
seemed as fresh as ever. I don’t 
know how women do it. She re- 
minded me of my wife; Elsie and 
I had pub-crawled three nights a 
week for half a year before we 
were married and it was always I 
who began getting disorderly. 

Semyon resisted only briefly. 
Then he sat back, sprawled in his 
chair, and smiled lovingly at us. 
“Good party, Logan,” he said. 

“The best,” I agreed. I sneaked 
a look at my watch; it was hard 
to make it out and even harder to 
perform the necessary subtrac- 
tion, but as near as I could figure, 
it was two hours since I had taken 
my first shot. The anthrax col- 
onies in my system were pretty 
well established; I had a fine 
building case of fever and ap- 
proaching delirium. Any minute 
now, the second layer of the pas- 
tille would dissolve and the anti- 
biotics would take over, cleaning 
out the bacteria and sobering me 
up. It was about right, I thought 
fuzzily, computing the time to get 
back to base and the amount of 
-sleep I would have before our 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



transportation arrived the next 
morning. 

And completely forgetting the 
trouble with mixing your shots. 
For the antibiotics are specifics; 
the cores that will sober up your 
case of anthrax in an hour don’t 
touch pneumococcus or the 
others. I was in for a double- 
jointed hangover — still drunk on 
the second dose while I was being 
sobered up from the first. I didn’t 
know it and it was just as well. 

But I knew it the next morn- 
ing. 

Oh, yes! 

XII 

what I do,” I told Sem- 
yon, who was rubberneck- 
ing at the big ships in the wash. 
He glowered resentfully, but he 
followed orders. 

We stepped into a submersible 
whaleboat and sat ourselves in 
the sternsheets while a couple of 
efficient seamen disposed the 
crates containing the animals in 
the cargo space. They were al- 
most all the baggage Semyon and 
I had between us; the orders had 
specified strip-ship condition. It 
meant battle stations; it meant 
the big-ship Navy and a combat 
mission; it meant, perhaps, get- 
ting somewhere near the east 
coast of Africa and Elsie. 

We boarded Monmouth, a for- 
ty-thousand-ton carrier, by one of 



the three after gangways, and 
Semyon was so preoccupied 
watching the whaleboat carrying 
our animals to a forward gang- 
way for loading that he almost 
forgot to salute the colors. I 
nudged him and he looked at me 
blankly for a moment before he 
remembered our careful rehear- 
sal. Josie and the apes were easier 
to train than Semyon Timayazev. 

Our quarters were small but 
comfortable; we shifted into dress 
blues and reported to the execu- 
tive officer and were sent imme- 
diately to see the captain. I had 
almost forgotten such niceties of 
the naval service as the captain’s 
call. I would have felt like the 
wanderer coming home, only I 
wasn’t feeling much of anything 
except a queasiness in my stom- 
ach and a throbbing like Mon- 
mouth’s main-drive engines in my 
head. 

But I got through the interview 
with the captain all right and so 
did Semyon. Having a hangover 
is not the worst thing that can 
happen to a naval officer on his 
first day at a new ship. It tends 
to make you concentrate on what 
you are doing. 

But as soon as we had a mo- 
ment to ourselves, we headed for 
the sickbay and wheedled vitamin 
shots out of one of the surgeons. 
He thought it was very funny. 
They helped, but I did not enjoy 
the surgeon’s prescription for 



SLAVE SHIP 



137 



“helping to re-establish the in- 
testinal flora” which he claimed 
the antibiotics had pretty well 
knocked out. It was yoghurt and 
I forced it down, but I almost lost 
it again when Semyon cried de- 
lightedly: “Schav! Please, Doc- 
tor— me, too!” and proceeded to 
swallow a pint of the stuff. 

A ll in all, we were in pretty 
good shape for the briefing 
at nine hundred hours the next 
morning, except for Semyon’s 
worry about his beloved dogs. 
“Josie, of course,” he told me fret- 
fully. “They understand Josie, she 
is on the orders. And Sammy is all 
right, and the apes. But the little 
puppies, Logan, will they be all 
right? No orders for them, you 
know.” 

I chased him down to the 
whaleboat level to look them 
over. 

Before sunrise, we got under 
weigh. Monmouth slipped lines 
and stood out into the channel — 
on the surface, since Caodai radar 
didn’t matter on our initial course 
in the Gulf. I was on deck in 
officer’s country as we sailed, feel- 
ing useless, with reason. I had no 
part in the complicated task of 
getting a war vessel on course. 

Faint dawn light was coming 
up behind us. Monmouth blink- 
ered gocd-by to the harbor moni- 
tor through a gentle drizzle and 
then the hailer gave all of us 

138 



idlers the warning. Stand by to 
submerge. I found a spot out of 
the traffic lanes, near a running 
port, and I watched through the 
glass as the deck parties stripped 
and stowed the outboard gear. 
They did their job and disap- 
peared in well under sixty sec- 
onds. 

Monmouth was a taut ship. 

There was a hoot and jangling 
of bells and Monmouth slid down- 
ward into the water. Green and 
blue waves bubbled up over my 
port, turned brackish gray, and 
then there was nothing at all to 
see, nothing but a faint sourceless 
light through the water outside. 

I went to the briefing in a 
thoughtful mood. 

I was astonished at the number 
of officers at the briefing — nearly 
sixty. The ship’s executive officer 
rapped his knuckles against the 
standing microphone and called 
us to attention. 

He looked at us queerly for a 
moment before he spoke. Then 
he waved a red-sealed envelope 
and said: 

“Welcome aboard, gentlemen. 
You’ve all got quarters and you 
all know you’re on a crash-prior- 
ity mission, and half of you have 
been haunting my office ever 
since we got under weigh. Well, I 
couldn’t tell you anything. I’ve 
been in this Navy for forty-six 
years, and I’ve heard of sealed 
orders, and I always thought they 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



were something you read about in 
books.” 

H e slapped the envelope 
against the mike and the 
amplified thud rolled around the 
room. ‘‘That’s what we got here. 
Sealed orders. In — ” he glanced 
at his watch — “in one minute, the 
captain’s going to be opening his 
copy of these and then we’ll all 
know what we’re up to. Until 
then, hold your breath.” 

He rocked back on his heels, 
calmly observing his watch. Then 
he leaned forward again and I 
guess we all really did hold our 
breaths. 

He said: “I forgot to tell you, 
those of you that don’t know it 
already, that Captain’s Calls are 
suspended for the time being, so 
don’t bother me for appoint- 
ments.” 

There was a groan from the 
sixty of us and he said : “All right, 
gentlemen. Here it is.” And he 
stripped the seals off the enve- 
lope and began to read. 

It was a crash-priority mission, 
all right. Even the weary old exec 
stood straighter and seemed to 
come alive as he read the formal 
phrases from the orders. 

It was — the Glotch, though that 
wasn’t what the orders called it. 
Intelligence had come up with 
the conclusion that the Caodai 
headquarters for the new weapon 
was not on the interdicted main- 



land, but the island of Madagas- 
car. 

Our sortie was to make recon- 
naissance, to find out what was 
there — and, if possible, to pulver- 
ize it. 

“Target Gamma.” That’s what 
the orders called it — a point fixed 
with grid markings on a map. 
Something was there, something \ 
which the Caodais were trying as 
ably as they could to hide. We 
were going to take a look. 

The exec finished reading the 
orders and folded the sheet. 

“Specific assignments will be 
given out later, by sections,” he 
said after a moment. “Gentlemen, 
this has been as much of a sur- 
prise to me as to you. But I sup- 
pose we all had an idea that it 
might have something to do with 
the Caodai weapon. I only want 
to add one thing to what you’ve 
just heard. It’s no secret that they 
have been hitting us pretty hard. 
Well, it’s been worse than you 
think. Worse than we can stand, 
in fact.” 

He licked his lips. “Gentlemen, 
you’re in for some rough times 
and only a fool would try to tell 
you that you’re all going to come 
through them alive. But keep this 
in mind: This is for keeps. I have 
it from the captain. If this doesn't 
work, the JCS’s next recommen- 
dation to the President will be a 
declaration of war. It’s as serious 
as that. 



SLAVE SHIP 



139 



“We’ve got to come through — 
or else it means the satellite 
bombs for' everybody.” 

That was that; we were dis- 
missed. We left the briefing room 
silently, all of us too busy think- 
ing about what the exec had said, 
and its implications, to talk. 

But we were not all thinking 
of the same implications. I raced 
from the briefing room to the 
chartroom, to confirm what I al- 
ready knew but could hardly be- 
lieve. 

Our target was Madagascar, a 
long, flat island hanging off the 
east coast of Africa. And next 
above it, inches away on the map, 
another island — 

Zanzibar! 

And Zanzibar meant Elsie. 

C EM YON came chortling to 
^ me: “At last we are equals! 
I have been promoted — I am now 
considered as valuable as you and 
the animals!” He displayed what 
had just been issued to him, an 
aluminum helmet, protection 
against the Glotch. The whole 
ship was being fitted with them. 

“We’re late,” I growled at him 
and tugged him away to our spe- 
cial section briefing. 

I had been on edge ever since 
I had found out how close I was 
coming to AORD S-14, where my 
wife was eking out her days in 
the monotony of a prison camp. 
Incredible that I could come that 

140 



close to her and not see her! But 
impossible that I could do any- 
thing else! For all of my months 
on Spruance, I had been praying 
for just such a strike; and now 
that it was within grasp, it was 
worse than anything I' could have 
imagined. 

So near, I said to myself — and 
for the first time understood how 
powerful the ragged, overused 
cliches of speech had to be to sur- 
vive so long — so near and yet so 
far. 

Our special section briefing was 
very exclusive — the briefing offi- 
cer, Semyon and me. He began 
without preamble: “There will be 
three waves against Target 
Gamma and you are in Wave 
One. There will be three groups 
in Wave One: Group A, air recon- 
naissance. That’s radarproofed 
gliders, launched at sea, with in- 
fra-red scanners and so on. Group 
B is intelligence officers — they’re 
Oriental nationals, mostly from 
Hawaii, I think, for infiltration. 
Group C is animal penetration — 
that’s you.” 

tF E closed his Plans book with 
a snap and said: “Your mis- 
sion is to get your animals as 
close to Target Gamma as you 
can and then get them back. You 
will spend the next seven days re- 
hearsing them. They w'ill have to 
learn to use small cameras, which 
they will carry around their 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



necks, and they will take pictures 
of everything in the area. You 
two are expendable, but the ani- 
mals are not — until they’ve got 
the pictures, anyway.” 

I glanced at Semyon. The brief- 
ing officer had just sunk TYeems 
and my visions of my first combat 
command. “How are we supposed 
to get the animals back if we’re 
expendable?” 

“We’ll establish a rendezvous 
point where they can be picked 
up. Frankly, I think you two will 
get caught. Maybe it will be even 
better if you do get caught,” he 
added callously, “because it’ll give 
the Caodais something to do. 
You—” he nodded at Seymon — 
“may get by; you’ll have cover 
papers as a Ukrainian neo-Bol- 
shevik refugee, of which Intelli- 
gence thinks there is a small col- 
ony on Madagascar. 

“But you — ” that was me —“are 
going to have to just stay out of 
sight. Oh, we’ll color up your skin 
and give you what looks like a 
prosthetic arm and hope you may 
pass for a disabled Caodai vet- 
eran. But don’t count on it. The 
dogs, remember; they’re what’s 
important. Unless there’s been a 
worse security leak than we have 
any reason to believe, the Cow- 
dyes won’t be on to the animal 
bit.” 

Going back to our quarters, I 
thought of the endless days on 
Weems, training the animals to 



operate a ship. Was it all camou- 
flage? Were the guiding geniuses 
behind Project Mako trying to 
throw dust in the eyes of the Cao- 
dais, in case they penetrated our 
security? 

Or was it merely that things 
had to go tight, and whatever 
long-rang plans COMINCH had 
for Project Mako had to be 
scrapped in favor of this all-or- 
nothing effort against Target 
Gemma? 

CTILL, I thought, looking 
^ through the portholes at ab- 
solutely nothing — we were fath- 
oms down and running lightless — 
maybe the prospects weren’t so 
bad. Maybe the expendable unit 
in this operation — myself — might 
actually enjoy being expended. 

It was all pretty far-fetched, I 
admitted to myself, but consider: 
If the Caodais nabbed me, the 
chances were that they would not 
shoot me out of hand. True, I 
would be a spy and they certainly 
weren’t going to pat me on the 
back and send me home with an 
ice-cream cone in one hand and 
a red balloon in the other. 

But we weren’t at war. We 
didn’t shoot Caodai spies. We ar- 
rested them, and tried them, and 
threw them in jail or in concen- 
tration camps. 

But would that be so bad — 
assuming, I mean, that the Cao- 
dais were as humane as we? May- 

14) 



SLAVE SHIP 



be the punishment would be 
something like imprisonment in a 
PW camp. And maybe, just 
maybe (but still, how conven- 
iently close at hand it was!) the 
PW camp would be AORD S-14. 

Semyon, grown queerly moody, 
spent most of his time slumped 
over a chessboard in our ward- 
room. I offered to play a game 
with him and his refusal was a 
masterpiece of tact. Even tact 
didn’t get him out of a game with 
the duty officer late one night, 
though, and Semyon trounced 
him so economically that I real- 
ized why he hadn’t been greatly 
interested in playing against me. 

I tried to make friends with 
some of the ship’s officers, but 
they looked on us with something 
of the attitude Chicago’s stock- 
yard workers have toward the 
cattle. 

I did manage to get into a few 
bridge games in the ship’s ward- 
room, but always with the feeling 
of being an interloper. And the 
ship’s officers, for that matter, 
struck me as an eccentric lot, far 
below the standards of Spruance. 

The only one I cottoned to at 
all was a gunnery officer named 
Rooie, like myself a former scout- 
torp pilot on a Spruance-class 
cruiser, now on limited duty be- 
cause of injuries which accounted 
for some of the three rows of rib- 
bons on his chest. He was salty 
and amiable, but unfortunately 

142 



the othfer officers of his duty sec- 
tion disliked me on sight. 

I^OR a few days, it was bear- 
able, because they urgently 
needed a fourth for bridge. But 
after we went down five tricks, 
doubled and redoubled, after I 
had started with the Pratt con- 
vention (opening two-bid to show 
a void in a suit), my partner 
threw his cards on the floor. He 
was an ensign named Winning- 
ton, a beefy young redhead, and 
what he said about my bridge- 
playing was bad enough, but what 
he said about me personally made 
it impossible to stay in the room. 

So it all worked out for the 
best. Semyon and I spent tedious 
hours with Josie and Sammy, 
while the chimps asked ridiculous 
questions and the puppies got in 
the way; and they were all ready 
for the big performance. Heaven 
knows what sense they made out 
of the answers we gave to their 
“Why”s, but they knew their jobs. 

From I^lorida, we swept grandly 
south and east, as our course was 
lined out day by day in the chart- 
room. At forty knots — not our 
best speed, but the one which 
made the least noise and fuss to 
alert Caodai sonars — we were 
clipping off nearly a thousand 
miles a day. 

Each night we surfaced briefly 
to let the navigators obtain a fix, 
and for a few moments each time, 

GALAXY SC'lENCE FICTION 



half a dozen lucky souls were per- 
mitted out on the weather deck, 
perhaps to see the stars. But not 
me. 

For eleven days, I counted my 
fingers and thumbs while we went 
from the Caribbean through the 
South Atlantic, and into' the broad 
curve that grazed the Antarctic 
Ocean itself south of Good Hope. 
And then we were creeping up the 
eastern flank of Africa — slow and 
wary. 

These were interdicted waters. 
If we were spotted here, we were 
dead; at the best, we would have 
to abort and run. Our orders were 
to avoid engagement unless it was 
forced on us, but there was a 
pretty fair chance that we might 
have no choice. Consequently the 
fire-control stations were double- 
manned around the clock, and we 
crept under the thermoplane, in 
the dense Antarctic Deep water, 
with our fingers crossed. 

It was dead reckoning now. 
The navigators had only the frag- 
mentary charts of submarine con- 
figurations to help them get a fix. 
Surfacing, even for a moment, was 
out of the question. 

The strain was beginning to tell 
on the ship’s crew. 

T LOOKED in on Lieutenant 
Rooie’s wardroom. It was like 
the condemned cell block in the 
death house. Rooie was there, 
watching a canned TV program

in a film viewer, and when I 
tapped him on the shoulder, he 
jumped. 

“Oh, Moeller,” he said, but his 
•eyes were hunted and it was a 
moment before he smiled. “How 
are you?” He switched off the film 
viewer. “I don’t know what the 
blasted thing is about, anyhow. 
Want some coffee?” 

He signaled the mess atten- 
dant without waiting for me to 
answer. She was an enlisted 
Wave, rather attractive-looking 
from the rear; I didn’t get a good 
look at her face as she went out 
for our coffee. 

Winnington appeared from be- 
hind a bookshelf. “Hello,” he said, 
a little stiffly. 

“Hi.” If he wanted to forget the 
fracas at the card table, I was 
willing. 

We all sat down and talked 
about nothing in particular. They 
were eager to talk, even Winning- 
ton. It is an ugly companion, the 
knowledge that at any time some 
wandering Caodai sonar beam 
may bounce off your ship’s hull 
and lead a torpedo to you. 

“Your coffee, sir.” Winnington 
took a cup, and the girl turned 
to me. She was attractive from 
the front, too; only a seaman- 
second, but young and fresh-look- 
ing. She wore no makeup, but — 

But I had seen her before. 

When I had seen her before, 
she had worn quite a lot of 

143 



makeup — makeup and little else! 

“Nina Merriam!” I said. There 
was no doubt in my mind; the 
last time I had seen her, her 
hair had been a different color; 
but it was the same girl — the 
ensign stripper from the Passion 
Pit. 

I stood up so fast that I kicked 
my chair over backward. “What 
the, devil are you doing here?” I 
bellowed at her. 

Rooie and Winnington were 
asking startled questions and I 
filled them in. Their reaction was 
sharper than mine. 

“Spy!” gasped Rooie. “Moeller, 
you’ve caught yourself a spy! 
Look at her — American as you 
and me, selling out!” 

took her at quick-march 
” down to the ship’s executive 
officers quarters, leaving Winning- 
ton gaping foolishly after us. 
There was an armed guard at his 
door. I told him; “Watch her. 
She’s probably a spy. Hold her 
here while we talk to the exec.” 

The girl said sharply: “I’m not 
a spy!” But what else would she 
say? Rooie and I pushed our way 
into the exec’s office, careless of 
shipboard protocol, and blurted 
out our story. 

We must have sounded like idi- 
ots, but nothing ruffled the exec. 



He’d said he had been in the 
Navy forty-six years; I believed 
every year of it. He stared at us 
thoughtfully and lit a cigarette. 

“A spy, you say.” He puffed on 
the cigarette in an infuriatingly 
meditative manner. He was past 
retirement age, the kind of griz- 
zled old three-striper who keeps 
passing his fitness tests for pure 
spite, refusing to be put out to 
pasture. And he kept looking at 
us. 

“Sir,” burst out Rooie, “she’s 
right in your anteroom. Why don’t 
you — ” 

He stopped, just barely in time. 
Thunderclouds were gathering 
over the exec. Well, after all, he 
was the administrative officer for 
a ship of the line and Rooie was 
b very junior lieutenant. But the 
explosion looked as if it was go- 
ing to be a beaut. 

It probably would have been, if 
we had heard it. 

But we didn’t. The loud-hailers 
in the passageway rattled with 
the klaxon alarm and then the 
voice from the bridge suddenly 
and harshly blared: 

“Attention on deck! Attention 
on deck! Bandits in fleet strength 
detected on intersecting course. 
Condition Crash Red! Battle sta- 
tions!”
