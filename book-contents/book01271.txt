THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc-

By MARK MALLORY 



The island was drowning 



— if they failed to find 
some common ground, both 
of them were doomed. 



T hey said — as they have 
said of so many frontiers- 
men just like him — that there 
must have been a woman in 
his past, to make him what he 
was. And indeed there had, 
but she was no flesh-and-blood 
female. The name of his lady 
was Victoria, whom the 
Greeks called Nike and early 
confounded with the Pallas 
Athena, that sterile maiden. 
And at the age of thirty-four 
she had Calvin Mulloy most 
firmly in her grasp, for he 




had neither wife nor child, 
nor any close friend worth 
mentioning — only his hungry 
dream for some great accom- 
plishment. 

It had harried him to the 
stars, that dream of his. It had 
driven him to the position of 
top survey engineer on the 
new, raw planet of Mersey, 
still largely unexplored and 
unmapp^. And it had pushed 
him, too, into foolishnesses 
like this latest one, building a 
sailplane out of scrap odds and 
ends around the Mersey Ad- 
vance Base — a sailplane which 
had just this moment been 
caught in a storm and cracked 
up on an island the size of a 
city backyard, between the 
banks of one of the mouths of 
the Adze River. 

The sailplane was gone the 
moment it hit. Actually it had 
come down just short of the 
island and floated quickly off, 
what was left of it, while Cal- 
vin was thrashing for the is- 
land with that inept stroke of 
his. He pulled himself up, 
gaping, onto the rocks, and, 
with the coolness of a logical 
man who has faced crises be- 
fore, set himself immediately 
to taking stock of his situa- 
tion. 

He was wet and winded, but 
since he was undrowned and 
on solid land in the semi- 
tropics, he dismissed that part 
of it from his mind. It had 
been full noon when he had 
been caught in the storm, and 
it could not be much more than 



minutes past that now, so 
swiftly had everything hap- 
pened ; but the black, low 
clouds, racing across the sky, 
and the gusts of intermittent 
rain, cut visibility down 
around him. 

He stood up on his small 
island and leaned against the 
wind that blew in and up the 
river from the open gulf. On 
three sides he saw nothing but 
the fast-riding waves. On the 
fourth, though, shading his 
eyes against the occasional 
bursts of rain, he discerned a 
long, low, curving blackness 
that would be one of the river 
shores. 

There lay safety. He esti- 
mated its distance from him 
at less than a hundred and 
fifty yards. It was merely, he 
told himself, a matter of 
reaching it. 

U NDER ordinary condi- 
tions, he would have set- 
tled down where he was and 
waited for rescue. He was not 
more than fifteen or twenty 
miles from the Advance Base, 
and in this storm they would 
waste no time waiting for him 
to come in, before starting out 
to search for him. No sail- 
plane could survive in such a 
blow. Standing now, with the 
wind pushing at him and the 
rain stinging against his face 
and hands, he found time for 
a moment’s wry humor at his 
own bad luck. On any civilized 
world, such a storm would 
have been charted and pre-

THE GOOD SEED 




dieted, if not controlled entire- 
ly. Well, the more fool he, for 
venturing this far from Base. 

It was in his favor that this 
world of Mersey happened to 
be so Earthlike that the dif- 
ferences between the two plan- 
ets were mostly unimportant. 
Unfortunately, it was the one 
unimportant difference that 
made his present position on 
the island a death trap. The 
gulf into which his river emp- 
tied was merely a twentieth 
the area of the Gulf of Mexico 
— but in this section it was 
extremely shallow, having an 
overall average depth of 
around seventy-five feet. 
When one of these fiash 
storms formed suddenly out 
over its waters, the wind 
could either drain huge tidal 
areas around the mouths of 
the Adze, or else raise the 
river level within hours a 
matter of thirty feet. 

With the onshore wind 
whistling about his ears right 
now, it was only too obvious 
to Calvin that the river was 
rising. This rocky little bit 
sticking some twelve or fifteen 
feet above the waves could 
expect to be overwhelmed in 
the next few hours. 

He looked about him. The 
island was bare except for a 
few straggly bushes. He 
reached out for a shoot from 
a bush beside him. It came up 
easily from the thin layer of 
soil that overlaid the rocks, 
and the wind snatched it out 
of his hand. He saw it go skip- 

8 



ping over the tops of the 
waves in the direction of the 
shore, until a wave-slope 
caught it and carried it into 
the next trough and out of 
sight. It at least, he thought, 
would reach the safety of the 
river bank. But it would take 
a thousand such slender 
stems, plaited into a raft, to 
do him any good; and there 
were not that many stems, and 
not that much time. 

Calvin turned and climbed 
in toward the center high 
point of the island. It was only 
a few steps over the damp 
soil and rocks, but when he 
stood upright on a little crown 
of rock and looked about him, 
it seemed that the island was 
smaller than ever, and might 
be drowned at any second by 
the wind-lashed waves. More- 
over, there was nothing to be 
seen which offered him any 
more help or hope of escape. 

Even then, he was not 
moved to despair. He saw no 
way out, but this simply rein- 
forced his conviction that the 
way out was hiding about him 
somewhere, and he must look 
that much harder for it. 

He was going to step down 
out of the full force of the 
wind, when he happened to 
notice a rounded object nest- 
ling in a little hollow of the 
rock below him, about a dozen 
or so feet away. 

H e went and stood over 
it, seeing that his first 
guess as to its nature had 

MARK MALLORY 




been correct. It was one of the 
intelligent traveling plants 
that wandered around the 
oceans of this world. It should 
have been at home in this situ- 
ation. Evidently, however, it 
had made the mistake of com- 
ing ashore here to seed. It was 
now rooted in the soil of the 
island, facing death as surely 
as he^ if the wind or the weaves 
tore it from its own helplessly 
anchored roots. 

“Can you understand me?” 
he asked it. 

There was an odd sort of 
croaking from it, which seem- 
ed to shape itself into words, 
though the how of it remained 
baffling to the ear. It was a 
sort of supplemental telepathy 
at work, over and above the 
rough attempts to imitate hu- 
man speech. Some of these in- 
telligent plants they had got to 
know in this area could com- 
municate with them in this 
fashion, though most could 
not. 

“I know you, man,” said the 
plant. “I have seen your gath- 
ering.” It was referring to the 
Advance Base, which had at- 
tracted a steady stream of the 
plant visitors at first. 

“Know any way to get 
ashore?” Calvin asked. 

“There is none,” said the 
plant. 

“I can’t see any, either.” 

“There is none,” repeated 
the plant. 

“Eveiyone to his own opin- 
ion,” said Calvin. Almost he 
sneered a little. He turned his 



gaze once more about the is- 
land. “In my book, them that 
won’t be beat can’t be beat. 
That’s maybe where we’re dif- 
ferent, plant.” 

He left the plant and went 
for a walk about the island. It 
had been in his mind that pos- 
sibly a drifting log or some 
such could have been caught 
by the island and he could use 
this to get ashore. He found 
nothing. For a few' minutes, 
at one end of the island, he 
stood fascinated, watching a 
long sloping black rock with a 
crack in it, reaching down in- 
to the water. There was a 
small tuft of moss growing in 
the crack about five inches 
above where the waves were 
slapping. As he watched, the 
waves slapped higher and 
higher, until he turned away 
abruptly, shivering, before he 
could see the water actually 
reach and cover the little 
clump of green. 

For the first time a realiza- 
tion that he might not get off 
the island touched him. It was 
not yet fear, this realization, 
but it reached deep into him 
and he felt it, suddenly, like a 
pressure against his heart. As 
the moss was being covered, 
so could he be covered, by the 
far-reaching inexorable ad- 
vance of the water. 

And then this was wiped 
away by an abrupt outburst 
of anger and self-ridicule that 
he — who had been through so 
many dangers — should find 
himself pinned by so common- 



THE GOOD SEED

place a threat. A man, he told 
himself, could die of drown- 
ing anywhere. There was no 
need to go light-years from 
his place of birth to find such 
a death. It made all dying — 
and all living — seem small and 
futile and insignificant, and 
he did not like that feeling. 

C ALVIN went back to the 
plant in its little hollow', 
tight-hugging to the ground 
and half-sheltered from the 
wind, and looked down on its 
dusky basketball-sized shape, 
the tough hide swollen and 
ready to burst with seeds. 

“So you think there’s no 
way out,” he said roughly. 

“There is none,” said the 
plant. 

“Why don’t you just let 
yourself go, if you think like 
that?” Calvin said. “Why try 
to keep down out of the wind, 
if the waves’ll get you any- 
w'ay, later?” 

The plant did not answer 
for a while. 

“I do not want to die,” it 
said then. “As long as I am 
alive, there is the possibility 
of some great improbable 
chance saving me.” 

“Oh,” said Calvin, and he 
himself was silent in turn. “I 
thought you’d given up.” 

“I cannot give up,” said the 
plant. “I am still alive. But I 
know /there is no way to 
safety.” 

“You make a lot of sense.” 
Calvin straightened up to 
squint through the rain at the 



dai'k and distant line of the 
shore. “How much more time 
would you say we had before 
the water covers this rock?” 
“The eighth part of a day- 
light period, perhaps more, 
perhaps less. The water can 
rise either faster or more 
slowly.” 

“Any chance of it cresting 
and going down?” 

“That would be a great im- 
probable chance such as that 
of which I spoke,” said the 
plant. 

Calvin rotated slowly, sur- 
veying the water around 
them. Bits and pieces of flot- 
sam were streaming by them 
on their way before the wind, 
now angling toward the near 
bank. But none were close 
enough or large enough to do 
Calvin any good. 

“Look,” said Calvin abrupt- 
ly, “there’s a fisheries survey 
station upriver here, not too 
far. Now, I could dig up the 
soil holding your roots. If I 
did that, would you get to the 
survey station as fast as you 
could and tell them I’m 
stranded here?” 

“I would be glad to,” said 
the plant. “But you cannot dig 
me up. My roots have pene- 
trated into the roclc. If you 
tried to dig me up, they would 
break off — and I would die 
that much sooner.” 

“You would, would you?” 
grunted Calvin. But the ques- 
tion was rhetorical. Already 
his mind was busy searching 
for some other way out. For 



10 



MARK MALLORY 




the first time in his life, he felt 
the touch of cold about his 
heart. Could this be fear, he 
wondered. But he had never 
been afraid of death. 

Crouching down again to be 
out of the wind and rain, he 
told himself that knowledge 
still remained a tool he could 
use. The plant must know 
something that was, perhaps, 
useless to it, but that could be 
twisted to a human’s advan- 
tage. 

“What made you come to a 
place like this to seed?” he 
asked. 

“Twenty nights and days 
ago, when I first took root 
here,” said the plant, “this 
land was safe. The signs were 
good for fair weather. And 
this place was easy of access 
from the water. I am not built 
to travel far on land.” 

“How would you manage in 
a storm like this, if you were 
not rooted down?” 

“I would go with the wind 
until I found shelter,” said the 
plant. “The wind and waves 
would not harm me then. They 
hurt only whatever stands 
firm and opposes them.” 

“You can’t communicate 
with others of your people 
from here, can you?” asked 
Calvin. 

“There are none close,” said 
the plant. “Anyway, what 
could they do?” 

‘“They could get a message 
to the fisheries station, to get 
help out here for us.” 

“What help could help me?” 



said the plant. “And in any 
case they could not go against 
the wind. They would have to 
be upwind of the station, even 
to help you.” 

“We could tiy it.” 

“We could try it,” agreed 
the plant. “But first one of my 
kind must come into speaking 
range. We still hunt our great 
improbable chance.” 

T here was a moment’s si- 
lence between them in the 
wind and rain. The river was 
noisy, working against the 
rock of the island. 

“There must be something 
that would give us a better 
chance than just sitting here,” 
said Calvin. 

The plant did not answer. 
“What are you thinking 
about?” demanded Calvin. 

“I am thinking of the irony 
of our situation,” said the 
plant. “You are free to wan- 
der the water, but cannot. I 
can wander the water, but I 
am not free to do so. This is 
death, and it is a strange 
thing.” 

“I don’t get you.” 

“I only mean that it makes 
no difference — that I am what 
I am, or that you are what 
you are. We could be any 
things that would die when 
the waves finally cover the is- 
land.” 

“Right enough,” said Calvin 
impatiently. “What about it?” 
“Nothing about it, man,” 
said the plant. “I was only 
thinking.” 



THE GOOD SEED 



11 




“Don’t waste your time on 
philosophy,” said Calvin 
harshly. “Use some of that 
brain power on a way to get 
loose and get off.” 

“Perhaps that and philoso- 
phy are one and the same.” 
“You’re not going to con- 
vince me of that,” said Calvin, 
getting up. “I’m going to take 
another look around the is- 
land.” 

T he island, as he walked 
around its short margin, 
showed itself to be definitely 
smaller. He paused again by 
the black rock. The moss was 
lost now, under the water, 
and the crack was all but un- 
der as well. He stood shielding 
his eyes against the wind- 
driven rain, peering across at 
the still visible shore. The 
waves, he noted, were not ex- 
treme-some four or five feet 
in height — ^which meant that 
the storm pi'oper was proba- 
bly paralleling the land some 
distance out in the gulf. 

He clenched his fists in sud- 
den frustration. If only he had 
hung on to the sailplane — or 
any decent-sized chunk of it! 
At least going into the water 
then would have been a gam- 
ble with some faint chance of 
success. 

He had nowhere else to go, 
after rounding the island. He 
went back to the plant. 

“Man,” said the plant, “one 
of my people has been blown 
to shelter a little down- 
stream.” 



Calvin straightened up ea- 
gerly, turning to stare into the 
wind. 

“You cannot see him,” said 
the plant. “He is caught be- 
low the river bend and cannot 
break loose against the force 
of the wind. But he is close 
enough to talk. And he sends 
you good news.” 

“Me?” Calvin hunkered 
down beside the plant. “Good 
news?” 

“There is a large tree torn 
loose from the bank and float- 
ing this way. It should strike 
the little bit of land where we 
are here.” 

“Strike it? Are you posi- 
tive ?” 

“There are the wind and the 
water and the tree. They can 
move only to one destination 
— this island. Go quickly to 
the windward point of the is- 
land. The tree will be coming 
shortly.” 

Calvin jerked erect and 
turned, wild triumph bursting 
in him. 

“Good-by, man,” said the 
plant. 

But he was already plung- 
ing toward the downstream 
end of the island. He reached 
it and, shielding his eyes with 
a hand, peer^ desperately 
out over the water. The waves 
hammered upon his boots as 
he stood there, and then he 
saw it, a mass of branches 
upon which the wind was 
blowing as on a sail, green 
against black, coming toward 
him. 



12 



MARK MALLORY 




H e crouched, wrung 
with impatience, as the 
tree drifted swiftly through 
the water toward him, too 
ponderous to rise and fall 
more than a little with the 
waves and presenting a gal- 
leonlike appearance of mass 
and invincibility. As it came 
closer, a fear that it would, in 
spite of the plant’s assurances, 
miss the island, crept into his 
heart and chilled it. 

It seemed to Calvin that it 
was veering — that it would 
pass to windwaz’d of the is- 
land, between him and the 
dimly seen shore. The thought 
of losing it was more than he 
could bear to consider; and 
with a sudden burst of panic, 
he threw himself into the 
waves, beating clumsily and 
frantically for it. 

The river took him into its 
massive fury. He had forgot- 
ten the strength of it. His first 
dive took him under an incom- 
ing wave, and he emerged, 
gasping, into the trough be- 
hind, with water exploding in 
his face. He kicked and threw 
his arms about, but the slow 
and futile-seeming beatings 
of his limbs appeared helpless 
as the fluttering of a butterfly 
in a collector’s net. He choked 
for air, and, rising on the 
crest of one wave, found him- 
self turned backward to face 
the island, and being swept 
past it. 

Fear came home to him 
then. He lashed out, fighting 
only for the solid ground of 



the island and his life. His 
world became a place of foam 
and fury. He strained for air. 
He dug for the island. And 
then, suddenly, he felt him- 
self flung upon hard rock and 
gasping, crawling, he emerged 
onto safety. 

He hung there on hands and 
knees, battered and panting. 
Then the i*emembrance of the 
tree cut like a knife to the 
core of his fear-soaked being. 
He staggered up, and, looking 
about, saw that he was almost 
to the far end of the island. 
He turned. Above him, at the 
windward point, the tree it- 
self was just now grounding, 
branches first, and swinging 
about as the long trunk, 
caught by the waves, pulled it 
around and onward. 

With an inarticulate cry, he 
ran toward it. But the mass of 
water against the heavy tree 
trunk was already pulling the 
branches from their tanglings 
with the rock. It floated free. 
Taking the wind once more in 
its sail of leaves, it moved 
slowly — and then more swiftly 
on past the far side of the 
island. 

He sci'ambled up his side of 
the island’s crest. But when he 
reached its top and could see 
the tree again, it was already 
moving past and out from the 
island, too swiftly for him to 
catch it, even if he had been 
the swimmer he had just 
proved himself not to be. 

He dropped on his knees, 
there on the island’s rocky 



THE GOOD SEED 



13 




spine, and watched it fade in 
the grayness of the rain, un- 
til the green of its branches 
was lost in a grayish blob, and 
this in the general welter of 
storm and waves. And sudden- 
ly a dark horror of death 
closed over him, blotting out 
all the scene. 

A VOICE roused him. “That 
is too bad,’' said the 
plant. 

He turned his head numbly. 
He was kneeling less than half 
a dozen feet from the little 
hollow where the plant still 
sheltered. He looked at it now, 
dazed, as if he could not re- 
member what it was, nor how 
it came to talk to him. Then 
his eyes cleared a little of their 
shock and he crept over to it 
on hands and knees and 
crouched in the shelter of the 
hollow. 

“The water is rising more 
swiftly,” said the plant. “It 
will be not long now.” 

“No!” said Calvin. The 
word was lost in the sound of 
the waves and wind, as though 
it had never been. Nor, the 
minute it was spoken, could he 
remember what he had meant 
to deny by it. It had been only 
a response without thought, 
an instinctive negation. 

“You make me wonder,” 
said the plant, after a little, 
“why it hurts you so — this 
thought of dying. Since you 
first became alive, you have 
faced ultimate death. And you 
have not faced it alone. All 



things die. This storm must 
die. This rock on which we lie 
will not exist forever. Even 
worlds and suns come at last 
to their ends, and galaxies, 
perhaps even the Universe.” 
Calvin shook his head. He 
did not answer. 

“You are a fighting people,” 
said the plant, almost as if to 
itself. “Well and good. Per- 
haps a life like mine, yielding, 
giving to the forces of nature, 
traveling before the wind, 
sees less than you see, of a 
reason for clawing hold on 
existence. But still it seems 
to me that even a fighter 
would be glad at last to quit 
the struggle, when there is no 
other choice.” 

“Not here,” said Calvin 
thickly. “Not now.” 

“Why not here, why not 
now,” said the plant, “when 
it has to be somewhere and 
sometime?” 

Calvin did not answer. 

“I feel sorry for you,” said 
the plant. “I do not like to see 
things suffer.” 

Raising his head a little and 
looking around him, Calvin 
could see the water, risen high 
around them, so that waves 
were splashing on all sides, 
less than the length of his own 
body away. 

“It wouldn’t make sense to 
you,” said Calvin then, rais- 
ing his rain^wet face toward 
the plant. “You’re old by your 
standards. I’m young. I’ve got 
things to do. You don’t under- 
stand.”

“No,” the plant agreed. “I 
do not understand.” 

C ALVIN crawled a little 
closer to the plant, into 
the hollow, until he could see 
the vibrating air-sac that pro- 
duced the voice of the plant. 
“Don’t you see? I’ve got to do 
something — I’ve got to feel 
I’ve accomplished something 
— before I quit.” 

“What something?” asked 
the plant. 

“I don’t know]” cried Cal- 
vin. “I just know I haven’t I 
I feel thrown away!” 

“What is living? It is feel- 
ing and thinking. It is seeding 
and ti'ying to understand. It is 
companionship of your own 
people. What more is there?” 
“You have to do some- 
thing.” . 

“Do what?” 

“Something important. 
Something to feel satisfied 
about.” A wave, higher than 
the rest, slapped the rock a 
bare couple of feet below them 
and sent spray stinging in 
against them. “You have to 
say, ‘Look, maybe it wasn’t 
much, but I did this.’ ” 

“What kind of this?” 

“How do I know?” shouted 
Calvin. “Something — maybe 
something nobody else did — 
maybe something that hasn’t 
been done before!” 

“For yourself?” said the 
plant. A higher wave slapped 
at the veiy rim of their hol- 
low, and a little water ran 
over and down to pool around 



them. Calvin felt it cold 
around his knees and wrists. 
“Or for the doing?” 

“For the doing! For the 
doing!” 

“If it is for the doing, can 
you take no comfort from the 
fact there are others of your 
own kind to do it?” 

Another wave came in on 
them. Calvin moved spasmodi- 
cally right up against the 
plant and put his arms around 
it, holding on. 

“I have seeded ten times 
and done much thinking,” said 
the plant — rather muffledly, 
for Calvin’s body was pressing 
against its air-sac. “I have not 
thought of anything really 
new, or startling, or great, but 
1 am satisfied.” It paused a 
moment as a new wave 
drenched them and receded. 
They were half awash in the 
hollow now, and the waves 
came regularly. “I do not see 
how this is so different from 
what you have done. But I am 
content.” Another and strong- 
er wave rocked them. The 
plant made a sound that might 
have been of pain at its roots 
tearing. “Have you seeded?” 

“No,” said Calvin, and all 
at once, like light breaking at 
last into the dark cave of his 
being, in this twelfth hour, it 
came to him — all of what he 
had robbed himself in his 
search for a victory. Choking 
on a wave, he clung to the 
plant with frenzied strength. 
“Nothing!” The word came 
tom from him as if by some 



THE GOOD SEED 



15 




ruthless hand. "‘Fve got noth- 
ing!” 

'Then I understand at last,” 
said the plant. “For of all 
things, the most terrible is to 
die unfruitful. It is no good to 
say we will not be beaten, be- 
cause there is always waiting, 
somewhere, that which can 
t)eat us. And then a life that 
is seedless goes down to de- 
feat finally and forever. But 
when one has seeded, there is 
no ending of the battle^ and 
life mounts on life until the 
light is reached by those far 
generations in which we have 
had our own small but neces- 
sary part. Then our personal 
defeat has been nothing, for 
though we died, we are still 
living, and though we fell, we 
conquered.” 

But Calvin, clinging to the 
plant with both arms, saw on- 
ly the water closing over him. 

“Too late — ” he choked. 
“Too late— too late—” 

“No,” bubbled the plant. 
“Not too late yet. This 
changes things. For I have 
seeded ten times and passed 
on my life. But you — I did not 
understand. I did not realize 
your need.” 

T he flood, cresting, ran 
clear and strong, the 
waves breaking heavily on the 
drowned shore by the river 
mouth. The rescue spinner, 
two hours out of Base and de- 
scending once again through 
the fleeting murk, checked at 
the sight of a begrimed human 

16 



figure, staggering along the 
slick margin of the shore, car- 
rying something large and 
limp under one arm, and with 
the other arm poking at the 
ground with a stick. 

The spinner came down al- 
most on top of him, and the 
two men in it reached to catch 
Calvin. He could hardly stand, 
let alone stumble forward, but 
stumble he did. 

“Cal!” said the pilot. “Hold 
up! IFs us.” 

“Let go,” said Calvin thick- 
ly. He pulled loose, dug with 
his stick, dropped something 
from the limp thing into the 
hole he had made, and moved 
on. 

“You out of your head. 
Cal?” cried the co-pilot. 
“Come on, weVe got to get you 
back to the hospital.” 

“No,” said Calvin, pulling 
away again. 

“What’re you doing?” de- 
manded the pilot. “WhaFve 
you got there?” 

“Think-plant. Dead,” said 
Calvin, continuing his work. 
''Let go!” He fought weakl>% 
but so fiercely that they did 
turn him loose again. “You 
don’t understand. Saved my 
life.” 

“Saved your life?” The pilot 
followed him. “How?” 

“1 was on an island. In the 
river. Flood coming up.” Cal- 
vin dug a fresh hole in the 
ground. “It could have lived a 
little longer. It let me pull it 
ahead of time — so Fd have 
something to float to shore 

MARK MALLORY 




on.” He turned exhaustion- 
bleared eyes on them. Saved 
my life.” 

The pilot and the co-pilot 
looked at each other as two 
men look at each other over 
the head of a child, or a mad- 
man. 

'‘All right, Cal,” said the 
pilot. "So it saved your life. 
But how come you’ve got to do 



this? And what are you doing, 
anyhow?” 

"What am I doing?” Calvin 
paused entirely and turned to 
face them. "What am I do- 
ing?” he repeated on a rising 
note of wonder. "Why, you 
damn fools, Tm doing the first 
real thing I ever did in my 
life! I’m saving the lives of 
these seeds!” END 



Charting Our Genes 

In a combined assault on ‘^linkage studies” for *^the location of genes for 
such things as eye color, blood groups and specific hereditary diseases,” 
Johns Hopkins University researchers and computer men are engaged in 
what may be the final probe into the mystery of heredity. 

Using inherited disease as a marker, it can be determined which genes 
travel together; the computers are set to work figuring out the odds of 
two hereditary traits being contained in the same chromosome, and then 
the genetic makeup of all members of the family in regard to the 
hereditary disease. 

The same method can be used with eye color, blood groups, and even 
such odd inherited traits as the ability to taste certain chemicals. 

Prof. S. A. Talbot, spokesman for the research group, cited ellip- 
tocytosis, a rare dominant characteristic in which the red blood cell has 
an elliptical shape, as an aid in computing the location of genes. There 
are about a dozen marker traits known to exist in Man of that clearly 
determinable a nature, and with the use of computers, scientists should 
be able to assign a linkage group to one in five of these traits. 

The major difficulty is collecting five-generation families. This is no 
problem with test animals and insects, but it is with hum.an beings. Prof. 
Talbot suggests an international linkage-analysis center where docu- 
mented data can be assembled and studied. 

The genetic prevention of certain hereditary diseases is one obvious 
benefit, and it is readily within grasp. 

Farther off is the complete charting of the chromosome for the preven- 
tion of all inherited disease — but not as far off as one vrould imagine, for 
progress is being made at a truly fantastic rate compared with the rela- 
tively slow development in other branches of medicine until now. Ulti- 
mately? Mating for desired traits has long been done in animal hus- 
bandry, and is an overworke<l theme in science fiction, where govern- 
mental decree is taken for granted — but need theie be force? There isn^t 
for marriage.

*Xhe key to Fred’s success was 



simple he may not have 



had much of a mind, hut it 



was all his, nobody else’sl 



H e had forgotten the beer 
again. He remembered 
that he had forgotten only as 
he opened the apaiianent door. 
A wave of smoke and onions 
and hamburger flowed past 
him into the dingy corridor 
and he stumbled on the gar- 
bage pail, plunked right in the 
doorway for him to lug along 
the passage to the chute. The 
bed was not made in one of 
their two rooms and newspa- 
pers littered the other. Elsie 
was in the kitchen. 

“Fred! Fred, did you re- 
member my beer?” 

18 






He closed the door so that 
the neighbors would not hear 
the row to come, except 
through the walls. 

‘‘Didja, Fred?” 

She stood akimbo in the 
kitchen doorway, a cigarette 
hanging from her lips, her 
dressing gown loose and spot- 
ted, her feet in old scuffs. 

‘‘I forgot,” he mumbled, 
‘‘ril go now.” 

Oh, no, he wouldn't. Not 
until he had heard a full re- 
sume of his lack of character, 
lack of enterprise, ambition, 
decency, thoughtfulness, man- 
hood, semblance of virtue. 

“I said I was going, Elsie. 
1 said I was going, didn't I?” 
“Well, my day ! You remem- 
bered my name !” 

It was true he rarely used 
her name or called her any 
husbandly term such as dear 
or darling instead, and rarely 
looked at her at all if he could 
avoid it inconspicuously. Ten 
years of marriage — ten years 
of legal proximity, rather, for 
nothing in him was married to 
anything in her any more. 

“I don't know why you mar- 
ried me,” he said. 

“Makes you wonder, doesn't 
it? Go on, get out.” 

H e almost knocked the 
man over as he left the 
apartment. The man was 
standing there, about to ring 
the bell. Well dressed, clean, 
expensive overcoat, polished 
shoes, black hat and a mild 
friendly face.

“Mr. Frederick Williams?^ 
the man asked. 

“Yes,” said Fred. 

“You entered the Sunday 
News competition for a free 
space ride?” 

“Yes. Did I win it?” 
“Unfortunately, no,” said 
the man. 

“Oh. Well, excuse me, Tve 
got to go and get something.” 
“I'll come with you. My 
name is Howard Sprinnell, 
Mr. Williams, and Tve been 
examining the entries to that 
competition. Frankly, we 
think you have considerable 
talent.” 

“Mister,” said Fred over 
his shoulder as they went 
down the stairs, “if you're 
trying to sell me something — ” 
“I don't want a penny from 
you, Mr. Williams.” 

“Then what — ” 

“We would merely appreci- 
ate a few hours of your time, 
at your convenience.” 

“A few hours?” Fred said, 
distressed. By working double 
shift in the automation-parts 
supply house, he could just 
keep going, financially and 
physically. The question of 
mental fatigue was exclusive- 
ly Elsie's province and there 
he had a rough working 
technique for responding 
without really listening. His 
job called for no mental effort 
greater than reading a ship- 
ping list, and his home life 
certainly didn't. Most of the 
time he had nothing in his 
mind at all; the days passed 



JAMES STAMERS 




faster that way. But Elsie and 
the job kept him tired. Odd 
how just not listening wrung 
you out and drained you off. 

“We are, of course, very 
glad to offer you compensation 
for your time, Mr. Williams,” 
said the man. 

Elsie would just drink it 
away. He'd have to haul crates 
of bourbon instead of cans of 
beer, that's all. 

“Not interested,” he said. 

That was it. That was the 
way to keep a salesman stall- 
ed. Just “not interested.” 
Keep saying it and nothing 
else. They all said they were 
not salesmen and weren't sell- 
ing anything. Every salesman 
he had ever met at the door 
said that. Galactic Encyclope- 
dia, Nuclear Brush, Your 
Venus Vacation, video sub- 
scriptions, even the Federal 
numbei's game, they all start- 
ed out by offering you a spe- 
cial opportunity and were not 
selling you anything. The man 
was still talking. 

“Not interested,'’ Fred said. 

“Fred,” said the man as 
they reached the bottom of the 
stairs, “I'm doing you a favor. 
I'm not supposed to tell you 
this, but either you come vol- 
untarily or you'll come any- 
way. Why not get paid for it?” 

“Not interested. And if any- 
one wants me, they can come 
and get me. I don't care. I just 
don't care.” 

He slouched off into the rain 
toward the supermarket. 

As Dr. Howard Sprinnell 



watched him go he took a 
small silver case from his top- 
coat pocket. He raised the 
case to his lips and said quiet- 
ly: “Sprinnell here. No. A 
clear case, but no. Pick him 
up.” 

T he squad car arrived si- 
lently on its jets as Fred 
Williams reached the door of 
the apartment house. He was 
carrying a pack of beer in 
each hand and was glad to see 
the man had gone. That's all 
you had to do — just keep say- 
ing “not interested” until they 
went away. 

“O.K., bud.” 

The troopers took him on 
both sides, grasped his arms, 
and levered him round. 

“Hey!” Fred protested. 
“The beer's for my wife. She's 
waiting for it. Please, fellers, 
I'll never hear the end of it if 
she doesn't get her beer.” 
“Joe,” said the trooper on 
Fred's right, jerking his head 
in the direction of the door be- 
hind them. 

A third trooper climbed out 
of the squad car, took the 
packs from Fred's hands and 
walked into the apartment 
house. He climbed the stairs 
swiftly, wrinkling his nose at 
the stale thickness of the air, 
knocked on the apartment door 
and waited for Elsie to open 
it. 

“Here's your beer,” he said 
shortly. 

“Where's Fred?” 

“Your husband is being de- 

21 



THE DIVERS 




tained in connection with a 
robbery at his office/' 

"‘Fred! Are you kidding? 
Fred hasn't the sense or the 
guts ! How long will he be 
gone?" 

“Two or three weeks." 

“Oh," said Elsie, scratching 
herself disinterestedly. “Well, 
thanks for the beer." 

She shut the door and the 
trooper returned to the squad 
car. He looked at Fred sym- 
pathetically but said nothing. 
The squad car took off, then 
turned on its sirens. 

‘‘What's this all about?" 
asked Fred Williams from the 
back seat. 

“Just excitement, bud. We 
live a dull life." 

You think you do, you 
should live mine. I don't care 
anyway. If I ask them what 
I'm doing in this squad car. 
I'll get a silly answer. 

“A guy called Spinner or 
something send for you?" 

“We don't get sent for, bud. 
Where have you been, the 
Middle Ages?" 

H e had a point there. Se- 
curity troopers were un- 
der direct control of the 
President and came and went 
as they pleased. The satellite 
stations gave them general di- 
rectives and the President 
directed the stations. Fred 
Williams grinned at the 
thought of Spinner, or what- 
ever his name was, calling the 
President to call a satellite 
station to call these cops to 



come and get him. He would 
have been shocked and fright- 
ened if anyone had told him 
this was almost exactly what 
had happened. 

They shot into the garage 
of an ordinary Federal police 
station, a large tiled vault 
smelling of hoses, soap and 
water. The troopers took him 
upstairs, along wax-polished 
corridors, through swinging 
doors and out of the muttered 
voices, footsteps, paper rat- 
tling and telephone tinkle of 
the station, into the smooth 
silence of a surgery. That fel- 
low Spinner was waiting in a 
white doctor's coat. 

“They pick you up too?" 
Fred Williams said. 

The Security troopers hoist- 
ed him into a dentist's chair, 
saluted the other man and 
went away. 

“You can leave any time 
you wish, Fred. If you do, 
though. I'll have you brought 
back. I'm Dr. Howard Sprin- 
nell." 

“Funny, I thought your 
name was Cloud Spinner or 
something," Fred confessed. 

“That's veiy interesting." 
The doctor leaned forward 
across his desk. “What made 
you think that?" 

“I just remembered it that 
way, that's all." 

“Ah. You have an unusual 
mind, Fred. No, I mean it. 
And just to show you this is 
not fooling, I have a call here 
for you from the President." 

“From Jake?" 



22 



JAMES STAMERS 




“From President Jackson, 
yes.” 

D r. SPRINNELL pressed a 
a green button on the 
video control on his desk. 
The wall panel lit and Presi- 
dent Jackson’s familiar face 
looked at Fred Williams. 

“Mr. Williams,” said the 
President. “The nation has 
called you to an unusual task. 
On your complete cooperation 
and absolute discretion in not 
mentioning to anyone — to any- 
one at all — what you may now 
learn depend matters of the 
utmost consequence to us all. 
I wish you good luck and God- 
speed.” 

The panel went dark and 
the doctor switched off. 

“That was Jake himself,” 
Fred Williams said. “Talking 
to me.” 

Like the many thousand 
million in the System, Fred 
referred to the President fa- 
miliarly as Jake, but he never 
thought he would get to talk 
to him, or be talked to person- 
ally. 

“What did he want to talk 
to me for?” Fred asked, dazed. 

“That’s what I want to 
show you,” said Dr. Sprinnell. 
“You understood what the 
President said about keeping 
this entirely confidential?” 
“Hell, no one would believe 
it if I said I’d been talking to 
the President, anyway.” 
“That’s what we figure,” 
said the doctor, smiling slight- 
ly. He picked up a pack of 



cards and flipped five of them 
onto the desk, a circle, a cross, 
two wavy lines, a rectangle 
and a star. “These are Zener 
cards, Fred. Ever see them 
before?” 

No, but they didn’t look like 
much. This was cockeyed, the 
whole situation — having the 
President call him so that he 
and a quack could play cards. 

“It will be clearer in a little 
while,” Dr. Howard Sprinnell 
said. “But first we must run 
this little check. Please point 
to one of these cards every 
minute when I say ‘now.’ ” 

Fred shifted himself in the 
high chair and pointed to one 
of the five cards obediently 
every minute. After twenty 
minutes, the doctor increased 
the rate. He noted every selec- 
tion. 

“Last lap now, Fred.” 

He was sick of this, but it 
was better than sitting in the 
apartment with Elsie. Fred 
pointed to a card for the last 
time. 

“And now,” the doctor said, 
standing up and feeding his 
notations into a machine in 
the corner of the room, “we 
have here the results.” 

He pulled a tape from the 
machine as it purred out, and 
showed it to Fred. It was a 
score of some sort. 

“In another room,” Dr. 
Howard Sprinnell explained, 
“we have a synchronized tele- 
path trying to influence your 
selections of these cards. If 
you have psi qualities, Fred, 

23 



THE DIVERS 




these results will show how 
high they are. If you have 
none, then your chances of 
picking the right card are one 
in five. That goes for picking 
the card ahead of the right 
one, or behind it, or two ahead 
and so on. In other words, if 
the cards had been selected 
here by a machine instead of 
you, we would expect twenty 
per cent of the answers to be 
right, by sheer chance — or 
statistical probability, to put 
it more accurately.” 

“So how did I do? Am I a 
mind-reader? That would 
make me laugh.” 

T he doctor glanced at the 
result tape he was hold- 
ing. 

“You have the results we 
want,” he said. “Otherwise I 
would not tell you this. You 
would be thanked, given a re- 
ward, made a fuss of by some 
civil servant of prominence 
and sent home in style.” 

He looked up at Fred in the 
dentist’s chair. 

“Do you remember that 
contest in the Sunday NeivsV’ 
Fred Williams remembered 
it. Every week there had been 
a puzzle picture to identify. 
The contest had lasted nearly 
a year. He remembered par- 
ticularly that each week there 
had been a cut of the room in 
which entries were to be 
judged, a large editorial office, 
just above the puzzle picture. 
Just a room. He had wondered 
why they bothered to put it in. 

24 



“There was a picture of a 
room in the paper,” said the 
doctor, “where each week, 
without any possibility of 
fraud or anyone seeing it ex- 
cept the judges, the solution 
to the puzzle was hung up on 
the wall in the middle of the 
picture shovm in the paper. 
The puzzles themselves were 
meaningless. We w'anted to 
see how many people wrote 
in the right solution just from 
seeing the picture of the emp- 
ty room. The right solution, 
of course, was the one hanging 
in that room at that time, 
which no one could see, and 
which was selected an hour 
before publication of the pa- 
per each week by random se- 
lection in a dictionaiy.” 

“So what did I get, a con- 
solation prize?” asked Fred. 

“In a way,” the doctor 
smiled. “But not for coming 
near winning. The top twenty 
winners were highly gifted 
people we recruited into the 
Psi faculties of Duke, Har- 
vard, Oxford, Paris and else- 
where. They scored consistent- 
ly throughout the year with a 
better than probability devia- 
tion.” 

“Huh?” 

“They got a lot more right 
than they could by chance 
alone. But your results Avere 
even more interesting to us. 
You got the same result here, 
just now, on the Zener cards.” 
“I’m still in the running?” 
“Fred, quite seriously, you 
are the best candidate we’ve 



JAMES STAMERS 




ever met. Hence the special 
treatment. In the history of 
the System Government, there 
have only been ten other peo- 
ple with results similar to 
yours.” 

“Is that so? Well, I suppose 
you know what you're doing, 
Doc. But I never had a pre- 
monition in my life.” 

Doctor Howard Sprinnell 
frowned. “I should hope not. 
Almost everyone has some psi 
capacities, but w'e're not inter- 
ested in minor phenomena. 
This is a government depart- 
ment, Fred. Here a thing has 
to work all the time, whenever 
it's needed, wherever it’s need- 
ed. A faculty professor has. 
off-days when he couldn't roll 
a die against chance. But you 
can't.” 

“Look, doc. I think you’ve 
got the wrong man. I'm Fred 
Williams. Frederick L. Wil- 
liams. Are you sure — ” 

“Look yourself,” interrupt- 
ed the doctor, leaning over to 
wave the tape under Fred’s 
nose. Chance would give you 
twenty per cent right — one 
out of five. Look at your re- 
sult.” 

Fred took the tape and 
studied it. “You’ve read it 
wrong. This says several mil- 
lion per cent.” 

“It says z 67 'o per cent. NiL 
Not one answer right, Fred. 
The millions are the probabil- 
ities of that deviation ... oh, 
never mind. See the big black 
zero?” 

“Yes, Doc.” 



“That is your result. It’s 
statistically almost impossi- 
ble, but you've done it. You 
did it with the puzste in the 
competition. You did not get 
one single, solitary answer 
right. Not one! Even a ma- 
chine gets one out of five 
right, Fred. Don't you see?” 
No, he didn’t, and it seemed 
to be just what Elsie was al- 
ways complaining about. He 
lacked this and lacked that. 
And now he couldn’t even do 
what a machine did. 

“Okay, Doc,” Fred said 
tiredly. “So I'm dumber than 
a machine. That figures.” 

“If you talk like that, you 
are,” snapped Doctor Howard 
Sprinell. “You have the high- 
est negative Psi rating in the 
Solar System. No clairvoy- 
ance, no telepathy, no induced 
hallucinations, no precogni- 
tions, no telekinesis, no psi- 
screens, no interference of any 
kind. When we send you out 
into — well, never mind, Fred. 
The main point at present is 
that you are a very, very rare 
observer.” 

“That’s fine,” Fred said. 
“Look, Doc, I feel beat.” 
“You’re meant to. Hell, 
man. I’ve been tiring you for 
two hours now. And what’s 
more. I'll give you a little 
warning in advance. We aren’t 
going to let you eat for three 
days either. You’re going to 
be so tired that your body is 
going to loosen its grip. Don’t 
worry, you won’t die. Ten peo- 
ple have done this before you

and they’re all right. You’ll 
meet them all soon. Now just 
hold still.” 

Dr. Howard Sprinnell slip- 
ped a hypo needle swiftly into 
Fred’s neck, withdrew it and 
dabbed with a piece of surgi- 
cal wool. 

“Off you go, Fred.” 

H e was breaking into 
pieces, but he didn’t care. 
He slept and woke and slept 
and woke in the chair in old 
Cloud Spinner’s office and now 
he was coming apart and he 
just did not care. Fred Wil- 
liams had had several years 
of simple apathy. It came nat- 
urally to him. His body rested, 
tired and inert, lacking in 
vigor from lack of food, and 
his mind separated slowly 
from it, like a man standing 
up in a pool of pygmies. His 
heart, hands, liver, stomach, 
viscera had their pygmy 
minds all bundled in with his, 
and now falling away in sepa- 
ration as he rose from them. 

His mind rose away from 
his body in the chair alto- 
gether. He viewed his body 
with unconcern, and the chair 
in which it sat, and the room, 
and through the walls the sur- 
rounding offices, and the 
rooms of the Federal police 
station, where the Security 
trooper named Joe who had 
taken the beer sat picking his 
teeth and gabbing with a pair 
of young Federal cops, and the 
roof of the block in which the 
station stood. 



His mind went up like a 
balloon, rising swiftly into the 
atmosphere, and the city 
shrank away under him like 
a toy plan, a kid’s aid to Bet- 
ter Civics, Home Town box 
VI, no Solar Credits neces- 
sary. He shifted automatically 
away from the main airport, 
but a moment later he went 
clean through an airliner 
cockpit, cabins with passen- 
gers, exhaust, and out exactly 
where he was before. His 
mind followed the airliner in- 
voluntarily, until he asked 
himself why, and immediately 
continued rising into the sky, 
looking down at the ground 
and the great spherical hori- 
zon. 

His mind rose into cloud 
and examined minutely a wa- 
ter molecule floating from a 
piece of dust as big as a rock. 
His sense of proportion sent 
him shooting out of the top of 
the cloud suddenly, like a star- 
tled fish. The ground became 
a globe gradually, and as the 
clouds below became little 
wisps over the light blue haze 
of the Earth, his feeling of 
liberation increased and he 
rose faster. He went through 
layer after layer of radiation 
sparking fitfully around him, 
and fiercer belts. And then the 
dust thinned out like scattered 
transparent ball bearings, and 
his mind approached the sat- 
ellite stations riding over the 
Earth. He was tempted to go 
through one, but it seemed un- 
important and he rose out.

JAMES STAMERS 




The Moon was swinging 
down away from him, a vast 
pitted ball bigger to his mind 
than the Earth now. He put on 
more speed, so that his mind 
flashed away from the Sun. 
Then as he paused an odd 
thing happened. One moment 
he was up there, alone above 
the small Earth and its small- 
er Moon, and the next instant 
his mind had flashed right into 
the center of the Sun, deep in 
the inferno of its core, where 
violence and variegated light 
surrounded him. And then he 
was out again, and his mind 
zoomed off as if he were sit- 
ting in the front seat of a low- 
slung car with the landmarks 
coming at a rush toward him 
and away to the side. The 
Galaxy fell away behind his 
mind in this fashion and the 
Great Nebula of Andromeda 
passed by. 

His mind roamed for a 
while among the other galactic 
clusters and the spiral gal- 
axies. He found his mind 
could appear at any point he 
wished, without the long rush 
through space. He could trans- 
fer instantaneously from place 
to place, and he hopped in this 
way at random from Crab to 
Lagoon and in to Polaris and 
out to the Great Spiral of 
Ursa Major, and onward to 
the open centers of the uni- 
verse. 

In deeper space, where end- 
less banks of galaxies roller- 
coasted away from each other, 
he felt a change of quality 

THE DIVERS 



come over his mind. It turned 
within itself where all the 
vivid stars became mere float- 
ing lights on the surface of a 
bubble outside. Here, within 
his mind, was deeper space 
and yet another liberation. 
His mind hung like a grape 
about to empty into a vat, 
which in this larger sense was 
truly himself. Insofar as he, 
Fi-ed Williams, was a mind, it 
was only a skin around the 
greater liquid, in which indeed 
he perceived all things held 
in common. 

He was about to throw off 
the skin and mingle in this 
condition where he and the 
Magellanic Clouds and Joe the 
Security trooper’s toothpick 
had a single existence, when 
he was back in the chair in the 
office. 

His body settled over him 
again. He felt compressed and 
imprisoned and robbed. His 
head turned as if it were o*n 
antiquated pulleys and his 
arms and shoulders were 
strung together awkwardly. 

“It’s bad to be back, isn’t it? 
You’ll never get used to that. 
But that was one hell of a 
Dive.” 

F red williams looked at 

the other people in the of- 
fice. There were ten of them 
and Dr. Howard Sprinnell. 
Three were women, and all 
except the doctor had large 
eyes. 

That was what you noticed 
about them, their enormous 

27 




gentle eyes and their slightly 
thin faces. The doctor held a 
mirror up for him to see his 
own face, and it was much the 
same. 

“They thought we had lost 
you there for a while,” said 
the doctor. “All Divers do that 
on their first trip out — but 
you. I’m told, almost joined 
the Lord.” 

“Is that what This is?” 

“It’s a matter outside our 
field,” said Dr. Howard Sprin- 
nell carefully, “and a matter 
of choice as to name. But mys- 
tical evidence seems to point 
that way.” 

One of the girls laughed. 
“You’re embarrassing the So- 
lar Government, Fred. They 
are not supposed to have any 
sectarian views. But that’s 
what we Divers think the 
This is. My name’s Milly. 'This 
is Pat, and Joan, Bill, Ed, Al, 
John, Anthony, Ricardo and 
Mitch. Welcome to the Divers, 
Fred.” 

Fred Williams smiled 
around. The women were at- 
tractive, all brown-haired and 
nicely shaped. The seven men 
were just regular guys you 
might meet anywhere. But 
then, he wasn’t anything to 
win a prize himself. 

“So far as we are concern- 
ed, Fred,” Dr. Howard Sprin- 
nell said, “and this is official, 
there is the normal conscious 
mind, the subliminal mind of 
which we are not usually con- 
scious but which is apparently 
a parcel of regional physical 

28 



minds and the mind you roam 
in, and there is the uncon- 
scious mind, which does not 
seem to belong to any one pez’- 
son, although everyone has it, 
and which you people embar- 
rass me by referring to as the 
This. 

“All we know, officially, is 
that the This is the natural or 
original home of the universe, 
and the only reason we know 
that is because we don’t want 
Divers to disappear into it and 
not come out. You’re all too 
rare. I gather it is almost un- 
bearable to come out of. But 
you’ll just have to avoid the 
temptation to go home, as it 
were. After all, it has taken 
several million years to get 
man out here where he is and 
what he is. And the second 
reason is that the entire Solar 
Government depends on the 
people in this room for infor- 
mation.” 

Fred Williams looked at the 
others. They were serious. 
The smallest of the girls, Pat, 
caught him looking and 
smiled. 

She turned to the doctor. 
“Can I tell Fred?” 

“You followed him, so you 
may as well. 7 don’t know 
what you Divers feel. But the 
Defense Council is waiting 
for the rest of you and we 
must hurry along.” 

Dr. Howard Sprinnell pat- 
ted Fred on the shoulder as he 
passed. He stood aside for the 
other Divers to leave the 
room, nodded to Pat and Fred, 



JAMES STAMERS 




and shut the door behind him. 

Fred Williams levered his 
body off the dentist’s chair 
and stood unsteadily. The girl 
took his arm. She was smaller 
than he, the top of her head 
reaching to his mouth, small, 
delicate and scented with 
heather. 

“There’s a lounge next door 
— you may not have noticed it 
on the way out — and there’s 
always a bowl of fruit and 
some cheese and biscuits 
there. Let’s go in.” 

He followed her. 

Even the short walk helped 
accustom himself to his body 
again. And the room was large 
and airy, overlooking the cen- 
tral park of the city and the 
clouds beyond the tall build- 
ings in the distance. 

He stood looking out at the 
view and eating an apple 
while she sliced cheese and 
laid the pieces on a plate with 
some biscuits for him. Then 
she sat down, folded her hands 
in her lap and looked at him. 
She was wearing a white-and- 
blue-check dress. She looked 
young and fresh and alive. 
The room was clean and fresh. 
He could not think of Elsie 
and that apartment as being 
in the same world. 

“Did the doc say you fol- 
lowed me?” Fred asked even- 
tually. 

“One of us always goes with 
a new Diver on the first trip.” 

“What did I look like? I 
mean was there anything to 
see?” 



“Oh, yes.” Pat laughed. "As 
a matter of fact, our minds 
look like the inside of eggs out 
there.” 

“But a plane went through 
me. And I shot for some rea- 
son into the Sun.” 

H e turned and looked 

disbelievingly up into the 

sky. 

The Sun made him blink 
and his eyes watered. 

“Now I can’t even look at 
it,” he said, “any more than 
I could before.” 

“Show me your mind,” she 
said simply. “Where is it?” 
“Well . .” 

“That’s the whole point of 
the Divers. A mind is not in 
space-time. It is connected 
with a body which is — or, to 
be exact, it is associated with 
— a physical brain, which in 
turn can work a mouth and 
hands to communicate what 
the mind has seen. The Solar 
Government has the problem 
in reverse. They can send ships 
through hyper-space ; other- 
wise, as you know, we could 
never have populated the Gal- 
axy. Why, Polaris, which you 
visited, is over a thousand 
light-years from Earth! They 
can make matter shift in and 
out of hyper-space. But they 
can’t communicate that far 
away. Radiation won’t take 
the shift. So the government 
can either send radio waves 
out and wait a couple of thou- 
sand years for the answer, or 
it has to shuttle whole ships 



THE DIVERS 



29 




to and fro just to get a simple 
message. 

“Worse, from a defense 
viewpoint, there are times 
when they must have informa- 
tion fast and when the nature 
of the news means that no 
ship will be either available 
or allowed to become available 
to carry the news. Suppose 
you are an intelligent life- 
form off Canopus and you 
think up a magnificent way of 
taking over the Solar System. 
You’re six hundred and fifty 
light-years away, but time is 
no problem because either you 
live longer than that or you 
have a tribe-culture. Even if 
the system had a billion police 
ships, which it hasn't, it could 
never be sure of catching 
Canopus preparing, or inter- 
cepting whatever horror they 
sent oft. And even if it were 
lucky, the ship would have to 
come back itself to get the 
news to the Solar Govern- 
ment. 

“A Diver can send his mind 
instantaneously from one end 
of the universe to the other, 
he can examine atomic parti- 
cles or survey galaxies, he can 
see through matter as if it 
were full of holes — which it is 
— he can patrol sectors and 
report exactly what he found 
there. He can dive into deep 
space and be free.” 

“Yes,” Fred Williams said. 
“That’s it. Free. That’s exact- 
ly how we feel, isn’t it?” 

“Never mind. You’ll be go- 
ing out again. Regularly. With 

30 



me at first until you get pa- 
troling under control. And 
then on your own.” 

“Are we always hungry?” 
asked Fred Williams, taking 
another apple. 

“It helps. The government 
would like us to be permanent- 
ly at the point of death, but 
that is fortunately impracti- 
cal. The less hold our bodies 
have, the easier it is to go out. 
There’s one other point, 
though. And since you’re com- 
ing with me on your training. 
I’d prefer you to know — no 
matter what the rules say. 
Whenever you go near another 
living being in a Dive, your 
mind can see the other mind, 
and you can read it from the 
pictures in it. It’s difficult to 
describe, but you’ll see for 
yourself. And if the mind you 
are looking at is connected up 
to a body, as we are now, and 
if the pictures don’t seem to 
fit the situation, you can take 
it that they refer to events 
still in the future as far as 
that body is concerned. The 
mind has a different space- 
time existence from the body, 
obviously, and quite often it 
is ahead in time. That’s why 
we have to be negative Psi. 
Anyone can Dive, but only a 
negative Psi can remain ob- 
jective about other beings’ 
minds. A Psi would collect 
other minds’ contents and get 
them confused with his own — 
future and present all messed 
up, full of symbols — take a 
look at a Psi’s mind sometime

on the way back. There are a 
lot of accidental roamers 
around on Earth.'' 

‘‘If we can read other 
minds," Fred Williams said 
thoughtfully, “then we Divers 
could have a hell of a lot of 
power." 

He was surprised when Pat 
laughed. 

“We all think of that," she 
said, “but so did the Solar 
Government. We have a bunch 
of Psis and Security troops 
tracing us all the time when 
we're in the body. But the real 
hold on us is not that. How 
would you feel if you were 
told you could never Dive 
again?" 

“I — I wouldn't like that." 

“You see? And you've only 
been on the first experimental 
Dive. Imagine when it is your 
whole life." 

Fred Williams nodded slow- 
ly. 

Then he asked: “Where do 
you live?" 

“Oh, no. Divers never mix. 
Our existence is a top-secret. 
And the risk of losing two 
Divers in a single accident 
would keep the Defense Coun- 
cil awake at night." 

“But everyone was here to- 
day." 

“To welcome you. That's a 
big occasion to us." 

“It's the biggest thing that 
ever happened to me," Fred 
Williams said. 

“I know," Pat answered 
quietly. “I saw your mind. 
But ril change that, Fred." 



She stood up and brushed 
her hands over her dress. 

“Where will I see you 
again?" he asked. 

“You never will." 

He stood up to protest. 

“Not in the body," she 
amended. 

He looked so mournful that 
she walked over and kissed 
him. 

“There's a good-by present. 
Diver. But we will meet reg- 
ularly." 

F inding him sitting with 
a pile of apple cores beside 
him, the doctor clicked his 
tongue reprovingly. 

“Tell me. Doc, how could 
you stop me Diving?" asked 
Fred worriedly. 

“Fill you full of vitamins 
and carbohydrates and alcohol 
and send you on a pleasure- 
cruise with a lot of accom- 
plished women," said Dr. 
Howard Sprinnell promptly. 
“Or allow you to stuff yourself 
with apples, for a start. Now 
come along or I'll bar you 
from the exercise room." 

Fred Williams followed him 
thoughtfully. 

“By the way," the doctor 
said over his shoulder, “your 
wife thinks you're under ar- 
rest. You’ve been here four 
days so far and we can keep 
you another ten or so. After 
that you’ll have to go back. 
You're on our payroll now, but 
you'd better keep your job. 
Or we can find you a heavier 
one, if you're not tired enough.

THE DIVERS 




We’ll seal a miniature trans- 
mitter into your larynx under 
the skin before you leave, so 
that you can report audibly 
from wherever you are. Div- 
ing has the same effect on the 
body as sleep, you’ll find, so 
you can do both at once. I’ll 
grade off the injections before 
you leave here. Now^ this is the 
political field as we know 
it . 

They stood in a large lecture 
hall, filled with spaced models 
of the Solar System, set in 
the Milky Way and surround- 
ed by the related galaxies. 

‘‘Here’s the spiral in Andro- 
meda,” said the doctor, using 
a long pointer. “I understand 
you went there ...” 

He took Fred Williams on a 
general tour of the hall. 

“Of course there are others 
not shown here,” he concluded. 
“The Coma- Virgo system of 
galaxies, for one example. But 
these are the ones politically 
important at this time. In Sag- 
ittarius, we have a problem. 
There’s a human colony there 
— a very early one, as a matter 
of fact — which we’re sending 
an envoy to. But we don’t 
know what sort of an envoy 
they are expecting, whether he 
should be a technical agrono- 
mist, a sociologist, a radiation 
expert, or a plain folksy re- 
minder of Earth, or what. A 
simple problem really, but a 
mistake will cost us several 
billion credits to correct. So 
your first assignment, under 
Pat’s tuition, will be to find out 



and report. When you get 
back, you’ll rank officially as a 
Diver. Rendezvous is over the 
Peninsula, above San Fran- 
cisco ; you can’t miss it. Take 
your mind there before you 
leave and come back there on 
the way in. Around fifteen 
thousand feet is the recom- 
mended height, but that, like 
your mind, is immaterial, if 
you’ll pardon the pun. And 
now I suggest you go down to 
the police gym and take some 
good strong exercise so that 
you feel properly tired for the 
journey.” 

Dr. Howard Sprinnell put 
his hands in his pockets and 
gazed at his polished shoes. 

“I don’t quite know how to 
say this, Fred,” he continued, 
“but I’m responsible for you 
Divers. You’re entitled to your 
own forms of amusement, of 
course, but please remember 
you are being watched by Psis. 
No dropping in on the Presi- 
dent’s bedroom. Other people’s 
bedrooms, all right, though I 
trust you’ll keep out of mine. 
But do nothing that could 
make you be considered a secu- 
rity risk. That is the only thing 
that would worry us.” 

Fred Williams assured him 
and left the hall to go down to 
the police gym. He did not un- 
derstand why the warning 
should be necessary. On the 
other hand, you could take it 
as a delicate permission to do 
anything that was not a secu- 
rity risk. He passed the police 
canteen and restrained himself

JAMES STAMERS 




from going in to order a 
doughnut with Martian syrup. 
It would keep him from Div- 
ing. 

H e rose into the atmos- 
phere above the city and 
headed across America to the 
rendezvous above the West 
Coast. The Earth spun away 
from beneath him. He had 
time to be surprised that in 
the few hours back on Earth 
he had forgotten the unbur- 
dened clarity of mind in a 
Dive. He knew who he was. He 
was unquestionably Fred Wil- 
liams up here, as much as he 
was Fred Williams down 
there. But here he felt differ- 
ent, free, while down there he 
was embedded and obscured in 
a shell of a body. Here, this 
time, his vision was not limited 
to a forward cone but extended 
in a complete sphere around 
him. 

He saw the large nick in the 
coast ahead and came down to 
meet his tutor Diver. 

Pat had said he looked like 
the inside of an egg, but he 
was not prepared for the great 
ovoid poised there below him. 
He came up to her with a rush 
and found he was even bigger 
by comparison. When they 
touched, he heard her voice. 
There was a slight resistance 
as his mind met hers and then 
she slipped inside his, so that 
he enclosed her mind within 
his ovoid mind. 

‘‘One of the disadvantages 
of a Diver,'’ she said quietly 



within him, •‘is that we can 
only talk to each other by con- 
tact. A Psi could see our 
thoughts radiating out like an 
aurora, but we can't. We trav- 
el this way when two Divers 
are together, which isn't often, 
so that we both think of going 
to the same place. If we do get 
separated, come back here im- 
mediately and we'll start 
again." 

“Fine." 

''Please, The very gentlest 
suggestion of vocalizing will 
do. That was like a cannon." 

“Sorry." 

“Much better. Now, gently, 
out. Think of rising slowly . , 
That's right." 

They rose away from the 
Earth. 

“Over there," she prompted, 
“is the galactic spiral arm we 
are in. See, running from 
Orion? The Solar System is 
out here on a limb. Over here 
is where we're going, deep into 
the Galaxy, our own galaxy. 
You'll soon pick up the main 
roads. See that fan-shaped 
arch? That's a T-Tauri varia- 
ble, signposts to us. Think of 
being just off that one now." 

He did — and there they 
were, in a dark lane of the 
Milky Way. 

“Now you can imagine what 
would happen if we were mov- 
ing separately and turned our 
minds to different points. You 
have to go back and start 
again then. Now, we're going 
down this dark lane." 

They moved through the 

33 



THE DIVERS 




splendor of the Milky Way, 
through vast lanes of fine dark 
nebulae, across a giant rift, 
past glowing clouds of hydro- 
gen and oxygen and bright ex- 
panding shells, rings within 
rings, flowing out from intense 
stars in their center as if the 
star were a pebble dropped in 
a pond of burning space, the 
planetary nebulae. 

The Sagittarian region was 
well known to Pat and she 
commented on the Lagoon, and 
Omega and Trifid Nebula sus- 
pended around them. The local 
system they sought lay off a 
loose globular star cluster, one 
of a crowd here deep in toward 
the center of the Galaxy, the 
bright core around which the 
spiral arms of the entire Milky 
Way ponderously swung. 

He was part engrossed in 
the technique of moving his 
mind, part awed by the variety 
and beauty of the Galaxy, and 
part lost in the beauty of the 
mind within him. She moved 
with deft, clear thought like 
the chime of crystals. The sen- 
sory images of Earth were 
gross and distorted projections 
of the way he saw her, but she 
was at once the beating 
rhythm beneath rock-and-roll 
and the abstracted clarity of 
Chopin, the summer wind and 
the warmth of a wine. He held 
her mind within his in a new 
union so complete that any- 
thing else was mere fumbling. 

“Thank you,” he heard her 
voice say gently, and they sank 
down toward the rings of 

34 



small planets they had come to 
visit. 

A COLONY from Earth im- 
plied an atmosphere, and 
several planets in the group 
indeed looked fuzzy. The two 
Divers skimmed rapidly from 
one to another in a general 
survey, selected the largest of 
those which might support 
man, and sank down through 
its belts of radiation. 

The central mass of land lay 
beneath thin clouds, through 
which the local sun shone in 
drifting spotlights over the 
cultivated areas and irregular 
groups of cities. 

“When we get closer,” her 
voice said, “you’ll see them 
walking about inside their 
minds, which to us will be 
cloudy colored eggs around 
them. They cannot see this, of 
course, any more than a non- 
Psi or we ourselves on Earth. 
If it isn’t obvious what they 
are thinking, we’ll have to go 
close enough to touch their 
minds with ours. But be very 
careful before you do that. If 
they are very empty-minded, 
there is a risk that their body 
magnetism will polarize your 
mind in temporarily. You can 
get out again, but it’s messy 
and unpleasant while it lasts. 
And it’s almost impossible to 
avoid being sucked into a me- 
dium’s mind, so I hope they 
haven’t got any.” 

They were now over the 
main city and headed toward 
a large domed building, appar- 



JAMES STAMERS 




ently modeled on the Capitol. 

“How did they get here ?” he 
^skcd 

“We don’t really know. The 
contacts so far have been by 
radio to a very early investi- 
gating fleet. Obviously they 
must have come out after the 
hyper-space drive was invent- 
ed — we’re over twenty thou- 
sand light-years from Earth, 
here, I’m told — but they don’t 
seem to realize the difficulties 
of sending them the envoy they 
asked for. Assuming these are 
the people that wanted one.” 

“Look, an old landcar — 
down there on the street!” he 
exclaimed. 

The colony apparently still 
used ground vehicles. As they 
came closer, they could see peo- 
ple walking in the streets and 
moving in and out of door- 
ways. There were no moving 
sidewalks, personal vertijets, 
anti-gravs. It was cleaner but 
otherwise as old-fashioned as 
the quarter in which Fred 
Williams lived on Earth. 

“Imagine coming so far — to 
find this,” he said, disappoint- 
ed. 

“You’ll find colonies are 
usually several generations be- 
hind, but let’s not be too 
hasty,” she said. “We can have 
a look around later. First, let’s 
see if we have the right planet 
and get this envoy matter out 
of the way. Down through the 
dome, here.” 

They passed through the 
weather sheathing and curved 
girders of the dome into an 

THE DIVERS 



assembly hall full of human 
beings, seated around a central 
dais. The colonists had appar- 
ently been inspired by Con- 
gress. A quick glance at their 
minds showed they were poli- 
ticians, no better and no worse 
than the Earth variety, intent 
on compromise and the ex- 
change of benefits between the 
groups of interests they seem- 
ed to represent. Several car- 
ried visibly in their minds one 
fixed interest and a quick 
count showed that agriculture 
was, in one form or another, 
the main business of the col- 
ony. 

“I think that answers it,” 
she said. “We’ll have to check 
on the other planets, but farm 
problems seem to be what 
they’re most concerned about.” 

He felt dissatisfied. “Should- 
n’t we touch one of their minds 
to see if this is really the polit- 
ical center? It may only be a 
village meeting.” 

It seemed incongruous to 
use the wonderful reach of 
Diving to gather little facts 
like this and to depart know- 
ing nothing else. Then again, 
he recalled the doctor describ- 
ing it as a simple problem. 

He felt her mind move un- 
derstandingly within his. “All 
right, let’s touch the Speaker 
and see how far his authority 
goes. He’d be very conscious of 
a superior Congress if there is 
one.” 

They moved together to the 
dais and brushed against the 
Speaker’s mind. The short, 

35 




bald man sitting impressively 
in the center* of the bubble im- 
mediately leaned forward and 
banged his gavel. The entire 
assembly rose to their feet and 
stood still. The Speaker slouch- 
ed in his chair. His mind shook 
off the influences of his body 
and rose up to touch the two of 
them. 

“Welcome, at last,” he said. 

“You have been expecting 
us?” 

“Of course. Though why do 
you say ‘us’?” 

They moved partly from 
each other, overlapping only at 
the extreme limit of their own 
minds, so that he could see 
there were two of them to- 
gether. 

A gasp sounded in the 
Speaker’s mind like an echo 
and there was a movement 
throughout the assembly. 

“Can they hear us?” Pat 
asked. 

“Naturally. Psi capacity is 
a minimum requirement for 
the Senate. Can’t you hear 
us?” 

“Only by mental contact.” 

“How odd,” the Speaker re- 
plied. “Still, we ourselves can- 
not merge in each other, only 
into housings.” 

“Housings?” 

“But surely ... You must 
know. Of course you must.” 

“Pm afraid we don’t.” 

“For heaven’s sake, what 
part of the Solar System do 
you come from that you 
don’t know a housing when 
you see one? Ganymede, Mer- 

36 



cury, Jove, Venus, Bacchus? 
Although I was under the im- 
pression that the entire system 
used the same terms.” 

“One moment,” Fred said. 
“What system are you talking 
about?” 

“This system here, natural- 
ly.” 

“We come from a different 
part of the Galaxy, a part that 
is called the Solar System by 
those who live there.” 

There was a multiple rus- 
tling of thoughts which dis- 
turbed the Speaker momen- 
tarily. 

“Please, gentlemen, please! 
Will every Senator please quit 
his housing so that we have 
less of these physical interrup- 
tions ?” 

E very member of the as- 
sembly sat down, relaxed 
his body and rose gently above 
it with a clear and uncluttered 
mind. 

“Thank you. Senators,” the 
Speaker said. “Now. Do we 
understand that you come 
from some other part of our 
galaxy ?” 

“Yes,” Pat said. “We call it 
the Milky Way.” 

“So do we.” 

“You probably brought the 
name with you.” 

“You are suggesting that we 
came from you and brought 
the name of the Galaxy with 
us?” 

“Why, yes.” 

“I see. Would you identify 
this solar system of yours?” 

JAMES STAMERS 




Pat held in her mind a pic- 
ture of the Solar System and 
the Sun, embedded in the long 
spiral arm of the Galaxy. She 
made the image of the Earth 
expand and contract in empha- 
sis. 

“Thank you. So you come 
from that little system, do 
you ? How interesting. And yet 
you have never heard of hous- 
ings.” 

“We call them bodies." 

“Well, so they are. I recall a 
primitive energy transmis- 
sion we had here long ago. We 
extended an invitation to the 
operators, but they have not so 
far arrived. They came from 
your system, or so they said.” 

“They did. They contacted 
you by what we call radio. We 
were sent, frankly, to see what 
sort of envoy should be sent 
here to you.” 

“Ah ! There has been a nat- 
ural confusion. We thought 
you were here from one of our 
outer systems where we are 
having some difficulty raising 
the right housing. In fact, we 
were just debating the correct 
form of grain to transmit to 
feed the housings on. They are 
in the awkward stage of hav- 
ing sufficient minds to exist, 
but insufficient nerve cortex to 
enable us to enter them. Our 
local represenatives — whom 
we mistook you for — have 
been having a very difficult 
time for several hundred 
years, but we will soon find 
the answer. Now, we will be 
glad to receive an envoy from 

THE DIVERS 



ybur system. We are always 
glad to receive representatives 
from our successful colonies. 
As to the type of envoy, any- 
one with a broad galactic view- 
point will do. We will, of 
course, be glad to offer housing 
and the usual facilities.” 
“When you say housing, you 
mean bodies?” 

“Naturally. Bodies such as 
these Senators’ or my own 
are the most adaptable for 
this climate. If you go in to 
our Ganymede or out to Jove 
you would have to use a local — 
er — body, because these hu- 
man types would melt or suffo- 
cate respectively. But the local 
housings in silica and in am- 
monia crystal have proved 
quite adequate for normal loco- 
motion and physical work 
there. The normal facilities of 
the sport planets would be 
available, to be sure. We are 
quite proud of our slither 
bodies, I suppose you would 
call them, in the snow worlds 
— quite a recent development. 
I fear we are not too luxurious 
here, but galactic opinion 
forces us to make our housings 
do almost everything they are 
capable of doing — ^walk, drive, 
cook and other such menial 
tasks. But then at least every- 
one knows we are not spending 
the revenue on our own hous- 
ing — er — our own bodies. Only 
last century we barely averted 
a political threat to make all 
Senators’ bodies sleep out in 
the open weather. But obvious- 
ly it is much moi’e expensive 

37 




to keep breeding new bodies 
than build a shelter such as 
this one. Even taxpayers can 
see that.” 

The Speaker’s mind echoed 
general agreement from the 
Senators. 

“It will come as a surprise,” 
Pat said clearly, “but our sys- 
tem believes we colonized 
yours.” 

This met polite and general 
laughter in which the Speaker 
joined. 

“Perhaps,” he said, “you 
would care to communicate di- 
rect with the Senators who 
were in charge of your system 
during the developmental 
stages. Will the Senators 
please come forward for con- 
tact?” 

Seven of the minds above 
the floor of the Senate drifted 
over to touch peripherally 
against each other and against 
Pat and Ered. 

“When we first undertook 
that project,” one or all of 
them said, “your system was 
entirely unpopulated. On the 
third planet, we found, how- 
ever, roughly humanoid apes 
in isolated caves and by selec- 
tive breeding we succeeded in 
making that species into a 
housing identical with those 
we use on this planet. Unfor- 
tunately, only the less stable 
minds of the Galaxy were 
prepared to live quite so far 
out and we eventually lost 
touch. Is the same housing 
still used?” 

“So much so,” Pat told 
38 



them, “that we cannot nor- 
mally detach ourselves.” 

“You mean you send bodies 
from place to place?” 

“Yes. The radio signals you 
received were from a space- 
ship containg men in their 
own bodies.” 

“Remarkable. Naturally, 
we accept your statement. 
But this implies considerable 
technical skill — and a prodig- 
ious disregard for the taxpay- 
ers’ money. You mean there 
were actually men out there 
in bodies sending energy 
transmissions, instead of vis- 
iting us in the mind from 
Earth?” 

“Yes.” 

“Remarkable. Very remark- 
able. Can you spare the time 
to tell us more about this? 
We can accommodate you 
with a double housing or sep- 
arate housing, whichever you 
prefer.” 

“May I withdraw to consult 
with my colleague?” Pat ask- 
ed. 

“Of course. We will continue 
our debate.” 

The Senators returned to 
their forms and the Speaker, 
sinking back into his body, 
recalled the assembly to their 
discussion of agricultural 
problems. 

O VER the dome, Pat slipped 
inside Fred Williams’ 
mind again. They thought of 
the enormous space-ships de- 
veloped over many centuries 
and at uncounted cost to give 

JAMES STAMERS 




men favorable odds in an un- 
favorable environment. And 
of the hazardous shifting of 
power based on bomb-satel- 
lites, and the fence upon fence 
of security precautions on 
which Earth and the Solar 
System depended. Or rather, 
when they considered it, on 
which their local population 
depended. It was not a prob- 
lem for two Divers but for a 
team of specialists. 

They returned to the 
Speaker. 

“We would like to consult 
with the original Earth Sen- 
ators again and perhaps bor- 
row two — housings — for a 
a short while.” 

“With the greatest pleas- 
ure.” 

The Senators concerned 
quitted their housings and 
floated across the assembly to 
join them. They all rose to- 
gether to the outside of the 
dome, where they would not 
disturb the debate below. 

“One of the questions,” 
Fred said, “is what happens 
if we died — ^by accident, for 
example — ^while in a borrow- 
ed housing.” 

“You imply a question as 
to what happens to any of 
your people, since they have 
lost the power to detach them- 
selves, or do not make use of 
it.” 

“Yes.” 

“Unfortunately,” one or all 
of the Senators replied, “we do 
not know. It is said there is 
a continual production of new 



minds in the universe, which 
appear here and there, where- 
ever there are suitable hous- 
ings. Others disagree but have 
no real answer. If we lend you 
housing — a panther-style 
body for personal racing on 
the grass steppes, say, or a 
vast whale-style body for en- 
joying some of our oceans, 
and so on, there is some risk. 
Among certain cultures, we 
find a return of the mind to a 
similar vacant housing. In 
other places, we have found 
an obscuration of the mind. 
We think there are parallel 
universes differing from this 
as mind-form differs from 
substance. And we believe 
each mind continues in these 
further dimensions. This 
would be practical if you were 
unable to leave a dying hous- 
ing. Our advice is not to get 
caught in any accidents. 

“Should it be advantageous 
to you, we will keep housings 
ready for you here. One male 
and one female, of course. Ah 
— on one question which you 
did not ask — you will find our 
guest housings are a uniform 
breed which became popular 
on your Planet among the 
Greeks and Romans as ideal 
godlike forms, shortly before 
we returned here. 

“And as to the other ques- 
tion you have not asked — ^we 
never interfere with local cul- 
tures, for the greater the va- 
riety of each, the greater the 
enrichment of all. Your sys- 
tem is entirely safe; we pro- 

39 



THE DIVERS 




pose to observe it more closely 
from now on. It is our im- 
pression, however, that you 
would be wise not to mention 
the galactic system we rep- 
resent, when you return to 
your Earth. It would be too 
upsetting to the established 
pattern. We are all human 
beings, but we have solved 
the same problems in very dif- 
ferent ways.” 

“We have not solved ours,” 
Fred said. 

“Oh, neither have we. But 
at least the few of us here, 
including yourselves, at any 
time as our guests, have 
achieved what you would 
probably call immortality.” 

“We are free to accept your 
invitation at any time?” 

“Certainly.” 

“Then we will report that 
no other envoy is needed,” 
Pat said clearly. 

“That would be beneficial 
indeed.” 

“And may we send you 
a very limited number of 
friends?” 

“Your guests shall be our 
guests. Again, we suggest you 
limit knowledge of us so far 
as possible.” 

“We are called Divers be- 
cause we can leave our bodies. 
Only Divers could visit you 
in this way, and we will not 
send any others.” 

“Thank you. It is largely 
our fault. We have come 
across traces here and there 
of other colonies which we as- 
sumed were the successful re- 

40 



suit of past experiments. It 
occurs to us now that several 
of these may be in fact body- 
bound expeditions from your 
solar system. We will investi- 
gate and correct our cata- 
logues.” 

“We can be of assistance 
there,” Pat answered. 

“Excellent. We wish you 
Godspeed and a pleasant re- 
turn.” 

T he nine minds released 
contact and moved apart. 
Fred felt Pat’s mind slip into 
his. They rose off the dome 
and increased speed, soaring 
into the sky and out, above 
the ring of planets. 

“Why didn’t we borrow a 
couple of bodies?” Fred asked. 

He could picture himself 
strutting elegantly in the body 
of a Greek god, with Pat to 
match beside him. 

“Please stop that — we’re 
zigzagging about. You’re new, 
Fred. Every Diver goes 
through the same routine — a 
pep-talk from the President, 
Doctor Sprinnell’s little tricks, 
your first Dive all over the 
universe, and then routine 
patrols. What you don’t know 
is that whenever we Divers 
come into contact with anoth- 
er race or another form of 
life, we are invariably offered 
gifts of some sort. Primitives 
sense the presence of a Diver 
and put on a show, lay out 
food and their treasures. The 
more advanced, using trained 
telepaths, try to bribe us. 

JAMES STAMERS 




And so on, without exception.” 
“Okay, so I’m new, Pat. So 
I don’t know the pattern. A 
few days ago I was a slob in 
an automation-parts supply 
house and now I’m here with 
you at the back end of the 
Milky Way, or the center, 
whichever way you look at it. 
But Doc Spinner made some 
pretty odd cracks to me about 
security and I don’t like the 
idea of being spied on all the 
time back on Earth.” 

“No Diver does. The De- 
fense Council put us in bus- 
iness, but now they are afraid 
of us, in a way. We can go 
anywhere and see anything. 
We might have a look at their 
secret installations or their 
private files. Then we would 
be in trouble.” 

“Well, I didn’t ask to come 
into this. But now that I’m 
in and a Diver, just one fancy 
move by Security and I’m off 
to get another body. That 
sounds odd, doesn’t it? But I 
mean it.” 

“I’m glad.” 

“Eh?” 

“I’m very glad, Fred. I 
wanted to see how you’d take 
it. I feel the same way. It’s 
true we’re always offered 
presents, but immortality is 
something larger than a pres- 
ent. And to get out from 
under the thumb of the Psis 
and their spying is something 
all of us have been longing 
for.” 

“And I’ll tell you something 
else, Pat. From now on, if the 

THE DIVERS 



other Divers agree, we’ll do 
what we want. Oh, the Solar 
System can have its patrol- 
ling. I’ll have to learn how 
that’s done from you. We’ll 
tell them what they want to 
know. But one sign of inter- 
ference and we’re off, and 
they can keep the bodies. We 
won’t tell them they are a 
backward colony that has for- 
gotten how to Dive. But we 
know it. We won’t tell them 
the rest of the Galaxy is run 
from the center back in Sag- 
ittarius by humans who can 
Dive. But we know that too. 
If I thought at all about it, I 
thought we were freaks, use- 
ful nuisances. And I didn’t 
mind being ordered about. But 
we’re not freaks, Pat. We’re 
the normal human beings that 
the Senate back there meant 
to create. It’s the Solar Sys- 
tem that is lop-sided, not us.” 

“I’m not — overinfluencing 
you, Fred?” 

“Hell, of course you are. I 
can hardly think of you with- 
out looping around a star. 
But the facts are the same. 
And from today, we’re not 
Divers. We’re the Free Di- 
vers, housing where we wish 
to, seeing what we want . .” 

“And protecting the Solar 
System, Fred.” 

“Well — they’re entitled to 
that. And we’ll keep to their 
security regulations for our 
bodies on Earth, if it makes 
them happy. We can afford 
to give a little here and 
there.” 



41 




They shot together through 
the nearest T-Tauri variable 
arch and zoomed happily. 
After a while, they returned 
to the rendezvous off the 
American coast on Earth. The 
other Divei’s were waiting for 
them. 

“It’s a custom,’’ Pat told 
him as they approached the 
nine Divers, hovering in 
space, “to greet you as a new 
Diver.” 

They closed together as 
they met, within Fred’s larger 
shell. He told them. There 
were no doubts among their 
minds. 

“Sooner or later,” Fred 
finished, “one of us was 
bound to meet the true Galac- 
tics we’ve just met. It hap- 
pened to be Pat and myself. 
I’m new and don’t know much 
about Diving, but I’ve seen 
enough to know that from 
now on I’m a Free Diver.” 

“So are we all,” they an- 
swered. 

R eturning across Amer- 
ica in the one shell, they 
scattered confusion and head- 
ache throughout the psi- 
watching stations in their 
path by the scramble of elev- 
en sets of thoughts. Then they 
separated and left Fred to go 
down to his body while they 
returned to theirs in the dif- 
ferent places Security had put 
them. Pat followed him down 
as a precaution. 

This time, Fred Williams’ 
body fitted his mind with a 

42 



greater feeling of strangeness 
but less muddling. The smal- 
ler consciousnesses of his 
body did not obscure his per- 
ceptions; he was aware of it 
as a housing for his mind. 

He looked at Dr. Howard 
Sprinnell, who had listened to 
him so far in silence, uncom- 
menting and unmoved, a mild, 
friendly face in the small 
medical room. 

“So, Fred. I warned you, 
Pat warned you. You go out 
on two Dives, a few days after 
discovering that such things 
exist, and you come back to 
give me an ultimatum for the 
Solar Government. A lifetime 
here in the drabbest, almost 
medieval surroundings of the 
city and, after a few days, you 
come back announcing you’re 
a Free Diver, owing nothing 
to anyone. Is that right? Do 
you still stick to that?” 

Fred nodded. 

“You realize what we can 
do to you, Fred? Dammit, on 
your first Dive you almost 
went out of space-time alto- 
gether, only you didn’t know 
what you were doing. Do you 
know what you’re doing now ? 
Do you think I’ve spent twen- 
ty years searching for nega- 
tive Psis for government ser- 
vice so that you can turn them 
against the Solar System?” 

“Hold on. Doc. No one said 
anything about being against 
the Solar System. If there’s 
work to be done, we’ll do it. 
But in our own way and with- 
out being spied on.” 

JAMES STAMERS 




“Just give me one reason 
why the government should 
trust you, with the entire Se- 
curity system.” 

“Because,” Fred said care- 
fully, “you may have my body, 
but in my mind I am a Free 
Diver.” 

“And nothing anyone can 
say will change that, eh?” 
“No.” 

“You know,” Dr. Howard 
Sprinnell said reflectively, 
“you’re talking as if you had 
another body cached away 
somewhere.” 

“Whoever heard of that?” 
“Lots of people, Fred. Voo- 
doo zombies, certain Mahay- 
ana religious leaders, prehis- 
toric Egyptians — there’s quite 
a well documented tradition. 
But the great problem has al- 
ways been to find a leader 
with the courage to do it sci- 
entifically and in the inter- 
ests of all the people, not just 
the members of some sect. 
Give a man the universe to 
play in and he doesn’t mind 
a few rules as long as he’s 
allowed to play. Finding neg- 
ative Psis and creating th^e 
Divers as an organized official 
body was easy compared with 
the task of completing the ex- 
periment — by making one of 
them revolt! Nine of the ten 
before you were too easily sat- 
isfied. Diving according to the 
rules and regulations was 
enough for them.” 

“Who was the tenth?” 

“Pat, She was the prettiest 
and most discontented. I 



thought I could stir up some 
fire.” 

“You did.” 

“Ah, good. I am high-Psi, 
by the way. I seem to feel 
she’s somewhere around here. 
However ... I can never be a 
Diver myself, but years ago 
I formed the theory that a lot 
of phenomena could be ex- 
plained by minds reaching out 
beyond their bodies. Now be 
careful, Fred. I don’t want to 
know. The Security Psis are 
very real and there are a lot 
of things I cannot afford to 
know. I’m a Solar Govern- 
ment servant, remember. But 
it seemed to me there might 
conceivably be a life-form 
somewhere in the universe 
which used the body as a ve- 
hicle for its convenience. I 
hoped one day the Divers 
would find such a life-form, 
and if I made the regulations 
stiff enough and supplied one 
or two other irritations, one 
Diver might decide to make 
the jump, to revolt and stand 
on his own feet. Free Divers, 
you called yourselves, eh? A 
good name. I don’t want to 
know \^here your base — your 
other base — is, Fred. I only 
want to know there is a group 
of people willing to serve the 
Solar Government regardless 
of time, theoretically for eter- 
nity — that’s what it amounts 
to when you work it out. As 
I say. I’m just a government 
servant. And thanks. Free 
Diver.” 

He held out his hand and 

43 



THE DIVERS 




shook Fred's. “From now on, 
Fred, you can all come and go 
as you wish. If you feel like 
keeping to the security regu- 
lations, fine. But I’ll make it 
clear to the Defense Council 
that there’s nothing they can 
do about it if you don’t. Men 
who don’t mind losing their 
bodies have always been some- 
what beyond the power of a 
government.’’ 

“On that basis, Doc, I don’t 
mind continuing the way you 
planned.’’ 

“Laryngeal transmitter, 
continue your cover-job and 
the rest?” 

“Don’t see why not.” 

“Come along then. You’re 
due to be released from jail.” 

Fred followed the doctor in- 
to the operating room. 

H e remembered the 

beer this time. Elsie lay 
back on her bed, drinking 
from the can, one of her scuffs 
dangling from a bare toe. 

“The trouble with you, 
Fred, is you can’t even rob an 
office.” 

“I didn’t.” 

“That’s what I mean. See? 
You just can’t do anything.” 
He lay back on his own ted 
and looked at her. There were 
a lot of things you didn’t mind 



putting up with, voluntarily. 
You married her, so you’d 
look after her, trudge to the 
shipping room to work and 
trudge back. The tireder you 
got, the better. 

For evening came every 
day, and with the evening 
came sleep for his housing 
and eight hours for patrolling 
the Galaxy. And beyond the 
system, out beyond the dark 
lanes, there were endless 
fonns of life . and the two 
great developments of men, 
one stemming from the other 
in different ways, but each ex- 
panding, colonizing, growing 
. all with problems for the 
Free Divers he led. 

“Wouldja get me another 
beer, Fred?” 

“Sure.” 

He remembered to slouch 
into the kitchen, as if he did 
not care. And when you con- 
sidered it, he didn’t care at 
all. This was one path of hu- 
man developments the Sen- 
ators never thought of. 

“Trouble with you, Fred, is 
you’re just a negative char- 
acter. You weren’t when I 
married you, but you are 
now.” 

Well, she was certainly en- 
titled to a beer for that.

Dissolute 

Diplomat 

By BOB SHAW & WALT WILLIS 

After you finish this story 

try doing a blurb 

that does not give away the point. 

It can’t be done! 



G RINGLEDOONK lay in a 
comfortable floor dish, ex- 
perimenting with himself out 
of sheer boredom. From three 
points along his perimeter he 
projected slim pseudopods, in- 



tertwined them for a short 
distance in the center, then 
split the end of each in two 
and looped them out to form 
six little hooks. 

Listlessly he solidified the 



45 



edifice and extruded an eye to 
examine it. It did not look like 
much. 

There were several races in 
the Federation who covered 
their bodies with fabrics, and 
this thing he had made might 
have been useful to one of 
them, but not to anybody civi- 
lized. More bored than ever, he 
commenced the slow process 
of dissolving the hardened 
pseudopods. 

A low whistle came from 
the entrance of the tubeway 
in the palace wall. The little 
circular door opened and 
Mugg, his Minister of Home 
Affairs, shot out onto the floor. 
He lay for a moment in the 
bullet shape that Gyoinks used 
for traveling the tubeway ; 
then he re-formed and flowed 
into the floor dish beside Grin- 
gledoonk. 

When he had stopped rip- 
pling, Mugg extruded an eye 
and, on seeing the peculiar 
shape his ruler had assumed, 
kept popping out more and 
bigger eyes to get a better 
view. Gringledoonk watched 
the process with disgust. No 
matter how often he was told 
about it, Mugg never seemed 
to realize how ill-mannered 
such displays of curiosity 
were. 

“What,” Mugg finally en- 
quired, “have you done to 
yourself. Your Softness?” 

“Never mind that,” Grin- 
gledoonk said irritably. “Why 
did you come here ? You know 
this is my rest period.”

“It's important,” Mugg re- 
plied. “A spaceship on normal 
drive has entered the system 
and is heading for this plan- 
et.” 

For an instant Gringle- 
doonk lost the cool green color- 
ing that befitted his position 
and allowed his natural mot- 
tled orange to show through. 
“What? What sort of a space- 
ship?” 

“It appears to be a Terran 
ship. Your Fluidity.” 

‘“The Treaty does not allow 
Terran ships to land here,” 
Gringledoonk said. “This is 
most unexpected. We’ll have 
to check the libraries on how 
to receive the officers of a Ter- 
ran ship.” 

He moved out of his dish, 
balancing the still rigid tripod 
with difficulty, and into the 
entrance port of the tubeway. 
The soft, warm radiance there 
helped him dissolve and reab- 
sorb the cumbersome exten- 
sion, and he vanished into the 
narrow aperture of the tube- 
way. 

After years of inactivity, 
Gringledoonk, Lord and Rep- 
resentative of the Gyoinks, 
was back in business. 

H al PORTMAN was hold- 
ing a moderate 800C 
when his warp-drive genera- 
tors gave a low sigh and van- 
ished into some unknown di- 
mension. The ancient Morris 
Starcruiser emerged into nor- 
mal space with a sickening 
jiggle. 

BOB SHAW & WALT WILLIS 




On checking his position, 
Portman found that there was 
a planet called Yoink so close, 
astronomically speaking, that 
he could have spat on it. He 
tapped out Yoink's coordi- 
nates on his destination selec- 
tor and began drinking beer 
in preparation. 

Two days and thirty-two 
cans of beer later, the Star- 
cruiser bulleted down for a 
landing. 

Wiping white froth from 
his bristly upper lip, Portman 
opened the lock and went 
down onto springy yellow 
turf. He found himself sur- 
rounded by a varicolored 
crowd of beings of indetermi- 
nate shape who chittered at 
him excitedly. He could not 
decide whether their agitation 
was due to the sudden appear- 
ance of his ship or the fact 
that it seemed to have crush- 
ed a number of their plastic 
buildings on arrival. 

He drew his sidearm and 
shouted, “Silence, friends. I 
am a citizen of — uh — Imperi- 
al Earth and I command your 
obedience. I want — ” 

One of the waist-high cones 
of jelly interrupted him by 
sprouting an enormous mouth 
and bellowing something about 
violations of the Treaty. Port- 
man gave the little alien a 
short burst from his Colt .045 
which reduced it to a pile of 
crackling cinders. 

“You’re only saying that be- 
cause you’re jellos,” he joked 
hastily, feeling that it might 

DISSOLUTE DIPLOMAT 



be better to pass the incident 
off. The directory had stated 
that the Gyoinks were non- 
aggressive, but there was no 
point in not acting in a friend- 
ly manner. He knew about the 
Treaty, but the cargo of con- 
traband luminous furs that he 
had tucked away would have 
caused unwelcome comment 
if he had waited for an AA 
repair ship. 

“Now listen, friends,” he 
repeated, brandishing the 
weapon. “We’ll get along as 
long as nobody argues or tries 
to get funny. My ship has 
broken down. Replace the 
warp generators and I’ll be 
on my way.’’ 

“Imperial Earth will be 
grateful,” he added as an 
afterthought. This diplomacy 
stuff was a cinch for a guy 
who knew how to handle peo- 
ple and things. 

S EVERAL of the Gyoinks 
immediately extruded 
stumpy legs and waddled up 
the ramp into the ship. Others 
went off toward a larger dome- 
shaped building, muttering 
something about going for 
tools. 

Portman went into the ship 
and obtained a further supply 
of beer, booting aside any of 
the Gyoinks who got in his 
way, then lay down on the 
bright turf and contentedly 
watched the work progress. 
In spite of the fact that the 
Gyoinks were just animated 
trifles, he had to admit that 

47 




they were pretty good space- 
drive mechanics. 

L ater in the afternoon as 
Portman sat on the ramp, 
smoking under the brilliantly 
pink sky, a Gyoink approached 
from the direction of the town 
on the horizon. This was a 
large, pale green Gyoink who 
looked unfamiliar to Portman. 
^ “What do you want? You’re 
disturbing a representative of 
Imperial Earth.” 

“I know, I know,” the 
Gyoink replied humbly. “My 
name is Gringledoonk.” 

“Anything to the Boston 
Gringledoonks?” Portman 
queried genially. 

“No,” Gringledoonk said, 
wincing slightly. “I come to 
apologize for the conduct of 
my people earlier. When I 
heard that you were here, I 
came from the Capital to make 
sure you would receive the 
proper attention due to a rep- 
resentative of — ” 

“Yeah, yeah, I should think 
so,” Portman cut in. “One of 
those jellos argued with me to- 
day. Argued ! How do you like 
that ?” He took the cigar from 
between his thick lips and 
pursed them in disapproval. 

“Most regrettable,” the 
Gyoink agreed. “I can assure 
you there will be no more such 
incidents. My people are igno- 
rant of the formalities in- 
volved in the reception of the 
captain of a Terran ship. For- 
tunately, our libraries contain 
something about the traditions 

48 



of the great Earth space fleets 
and, from now on, we will ob- 
serve those traditions to the 
best of our limited ability.” 
“That’s more like it,” Port- 
man said. 

I T HAD been necessary to 
dismantle the ship’s power 
plant and, as the Yoink nights 
were chilly and the installa- 
tion of the new generatora 
would not be completed until 
the morning, Portman was 
moved into one of the little 
plastic huts about a mile from 
the ship. He found that the 
Gyoinks had rigged up a ham- 
mock, of all things, but it took 
him only a short while to find 
the knack of sleeping in it. 

In the morning he was 
wakened by the sound of bells 
and the insistent prodding of 
a Gyoink who was proffering 
a glass of brown liquid on a 
small tray. The Gyoink’s shiny 
surface had become bright 
blue. Portman demanded to 
know what was going on. 

“Eight bells, sir,” the Gy- 
oink replied. “Your breakfast 
is ready.” There w^as a note of 
eager sincerity in the Gyoink’s 
voice. 

Portman stretched luxuri- 
ously in the hammock, took 
the glass and found that the 
Gyoinks had contrived to pro- 
duce a pretty fair rum. Grin- 
ning with satisfaction, he got 
up and lumbered out of the 
hut, stooping to get through 
the low door. 

Outside, a flat open convey- 
BOB SHAW & WALT WILLIS 




ance on four wheels, manned 
by two more blue Gyoinks, was 
waiting. It looked brand new 
and had lifebelts slung along 
the sides. 

“The Chief Engineer re- 
ports that your ship is ready, 
sir,” one of the Gyoinks said. 
“Step aboard and we will take 
you to it, sir. Aye, aye, sir.” 

Portman got into the car 
and sat down. As he was being 
driven the short distance to 
his ship, he found himself al- 
most wishing that he was not 
leaving so soon. Once the jellos 
had come to understand that 
he was the boss, they had been 
all right, in spite of being such 
ugly brutes. 

When they arrived at the 
battered old Starcruiser, Port- 
man hardly recognized it. Its 
hull was shining with a rich 
brassy brilliance in the morn- 
ing sunlight. Gringledoonk 
was waiting for him on a little 
platform at the foot of the 
ramp up to the airlock. Other 
bright blue Gyoinks stood in 
quivering rows nearby. 

“Good morning, sir,” Grin- 
gledoonk said, his voice 
charged with friendliness. “I 
hope that the launch we con- 
structed for you was comfort- 
able.” 

“The launch? Oh, yeah — 
very smooth. One of the jellos 
said the ship was ready. Is 
it?” Portman stepped out onto 
the platform. 

“Everything is shipshape, 
sir,” the Gyoink said. “We are 
doing our humble best to do 

DISSOLUTE DIPLOMAT 



everything in accordance 
with — ” 

“Yeah, I know. Skip all that 
stuff. As long as the new gen- 
erators are in. I’ll be satis- 
fied.” 

“There’s just one more 
thing, sir,” Gringledoonk said. 
The ranks of Gyoinks moved 
aside, revealing a shallow de- 
pression in the platform, in 
the center of which was a cir- 
cular hole about six inches in 
diameter. From under the de- 
pression a plastic tube led up 
the ramp and into the ship. 

“What, what ?” Portman 
snarled. 

“We only use this for long 
distances, but our library — ” 

“Skip it,” Portman said. 

H e pushed Gringledoonk 
aside and headed for the 
bottom of the ramp across the 
dish-shaped hollow. Too late 
he noticed that there was a 
peculiar radiance hovering 
above the depression, coming 
from little translucent panels 
around its perimeter. He tried 
to retreat. 

But his bones had softened 
too rapidly and indeed his feet 
were already flowing out of 
his shoes onto the floor, to be 
joined by what had been his 
legs and the remainder of his 
unwashed body. He stopped 
screaming as his head com- 
pleted its ^acious descent, 
and his staring eyes remained 
visible only for a moment, si- 
lently surveying the surface 
of the great blob which he had 

49 




so unaccountably become. It 
liquified still further and the 
mortal remains of Harold 
Portman ran out through the 
hole in the basin with a regret- 
tably undignified noise. The 
plastic pipe became dark and 
murky as he passed up it into 
his ship. 



“Just a matter of tradi- 
tion,” Gringledoonk explained 
proudly to the onlookers. “Our 
records are incomplete about 
Terran space fleet tradition, 
but they all agree on one thing 
— the Captain is always piped 
on board.” 

END 



The Plastics Revolution 

Within the memory of most people now alive, plastics have bounded into 
a leading place in all sorts of things from hosiery to construction mate- 
rials, yet their potentialities have scarcely been explored. Work now being 
done in Germany and Italy may replace or surpass polyethylene, the head 
of the polymer or long-chain-molecule family, that the majority of famil- 
iar plastics are descended from, along with straight chain alcohols and 
cyclic compounds with up to sixteen carbon atoms. 

The key now being explored is catalysts of organo-metals, such as 
combinations of aluminum, carbon and hydrogen, and titanium and 
chlorine. 

Dibasic acids with twelve carbon atoms and lactame with thirteen are 
produced by the cyclic process, promising new plastics that may outdo 
anything currently on the market. 

The organo-metallic catalysts make possible an “almost unbelievable” 
variety of chemical reactions. Ethylene, for example, is polymerized into 
substances of as much as several million molecular weight with atmos- 
pheric pressure, whereas less dense substances required high pressure. 
Among other qualities, the new plastics, used in tires, may increase mileage 
up to 120,000 miles I 

The new tetraethyl lead process, if proved practical, should reduce 
costs. This new method, when added to gasoline to prevent auto engine 
knock, has also been made possible by using catalysts. The United States 
alone produces 300,000 tons a year. It was invented in 1920 in America, 
and the new process using Ziegler catalysts reduces the need of so much 
sodium and chlorine as in the old process. It uses the temperature of boiling 
water instead of six to seven times as much heat and about half as much 
electrical energy is used. 




Nuts to mid talents! Mine 



was no satisfaction, never 
earned me a penny — and 
now it had me fighting for 



my life in... THE LITTLE RED BAG 






but finding only a sea of clouds 
instead. So I returned my at- 
tention to the inside of the 
plane, to the overstuffed gray- 
haired woman asleep beside 
me, to the basks of heads in 
seats before me, across the 
aisle to other heads, and down 
to the blonde. 

I had seen her in the con- 
course and at the gate, a 
shapely thing. Now she had 
crossed her legs and I was 
privileged to view a trim an- 
kle and calf, and her profile 
as she stared moodily across 
the aisle and out a window 
where there was nothing to 
see. 

I slid my eyes past her to 
others. A crossword-puzzle 
worker, a togetherness-type- 
magazine reader. 

Inventory completed, I went 
back to looking at the clouds, 
knowing I should be thinking 
about the printing order I was 
going to Los Angeles for, and 
not wanting to. 

So I started going through 
the purse of the woman next 
to me. Perhaps that sounds 
bad. It wasn’t. I’d been doing 
it for years and nobody ever 
complained. 

It started when I was a kid, 
this business of being able to 
explore the insides of things 
like purses and sealed boxes 
and locked drawers and — well, 
human beings. But human be- 
ings aren’t worth the trouble. 
It’s like swimming through 
spaghetti. And I’ve got to stay 
away from electric wires. 



They hurt. Now don’t ask me 
how they hurt. 

Maybe you think it’s fun. 
For the most part, it really 
isn’t. I always knew what was 
in Christmas presents before I 
unwrapped them, and there- 
fore Christmas was always 
spoiled for me as a kid. I can’t 
feel the color of anything, just 
its consistency. An apple 
senses about the same as a po- 
tato, except for the core and 
the stem. I can’t even tell if 
there’s writing on a piece of 
paper. So you see it isn’t much. 
Just the feel of shapes, the 
hardnesses and softnesses. But 
I’ve learned to become pretty 
good at guessing. 

Like this woman next to me. 
She had a short, cylindrical 
metal object in her purse with 
waxlike stuff inside it — a lip- 
stick. A round, hard object 
with dust inside — a compact. 
Handkerchief, chewing gum, a 
small book, probably an ad- 
dress book, money in a change 
purse — a few bills and coins. 
Not much else. 

I was a little disappointed. 
I’ve run across a gun or two in 
my time. But I never say any- 
thing. 

1 LEARNED the wisdom of 
keeping my mouth shut in 
the fourth grade when Miss 
Winters, a stern, white-haired 
disciplinarian, ordered me to 
eat my sack lunch in the class- 
room with her instead of out- 
side with some of the other 
kids. This was the punishment 



52 



JERRY SOHL 




for some minor infraction. 
Lunchtime was nearly over 
and we’d both finished eating ; 
she said she’d be gone for a 
few moments and that I was to 
erase the blackboard during 
her absence, which I dutifully 
did. 

Class had hardly resumed 
when she started looking 
around the desk for her favo- 
rite mechanical pencil, asking 
if any of us had seen it, and 
looking straight at me. I didn’t 
want her to think I had taken 
it while she was out of the 
room, so I probed the contents 
of her purse, which she always 
kept in the upper right draw- 
er of her desk. 

“It’s in your purse,” I blurt- 
ed out. 

I was sent home with a 
stinging note. 

Since then I’ve kept quiet. 
At one time I assumed every- 
body was able to sense. I’ve 
known better for years. Still, 
I wonder how many other peo- 
ple are as close-mouthed about 
their special gift as I am about 
mine. 

I used to think that some 
day I’d make a lot of money 
out of it, but how? I can’t 
read thoughts. I can’t even be 
sure what some of the things 
1 sense in probing really 
are. 

But I’ve learned to move 
things. Ever so little. A piece 
of paper. A feather. Once I 
stopped one of' those little 
glass-enclosed light or heat- 
powered devices with vanes 



you see now and then in a jew- 
eler’s window. And I can stop 
clocks. 

Take this morning, for ex- 
ample. I had set my alarm for 
five-thirty because I had to 
catch the seven o’clock plane 
at San Francisco International 
Airport. This being earlier 
than I usually get up, it seems 
all I did during the night was 
feel my way past the escape- 
ment and balance wheel to see 
where the notch for the alarm 
was. The last time I did it 
there was just the merest 
fraction of an inch between 
the pawl and the notch. So I 
sighed and moved to the bal- 
ance wheel and its delicate 
ribbon of spiraling steel. I 
hung onto the wheel, exerting 
influence to decrease the re- 
storing torque. 

The wheel slowed down un- 
til there was no more ticking. 
It took quite a bit of effort, as 
it always does, but I did it, as 
I usually do. I can’t stand the 
alarm. 

When I first learned to do 
this, I thought I had it made. I 
even went to Las Vegas to try 
my hand, so to speak, with the 
ratchets and pawls and cams 
and springs on the slot ma- 
chines. But there’s nothing 
delicate about a slot machine, 
and the spring tensions are too 
strong. I dropped quite a lot of 
nickels before I finally gave 
up. 

So I’m stuck with a talent 
I’ve found little real use for. 
Except that it amuses me. 



THE LITTLE RED BAG 



53 




Sometimes. Not like this time 
on the plane. 

The woman beside me stir- 
red, sat up suddenly and look- 
ed across me out the window. 
“Where are we ?’’ she asked in 
a surprised voice. I told her 
we were probably a little 
north of Bakersfield. She said, 
“Oh,” glanced at her wrist- 
watch and sank back again. 

Soon the stewardesses would 
bring coffee and doughnuts 
around, so I contented myself 
with looking at the clouds and 
trying to think about Amos 
Magaffey, who was purchas- 
ing agent for a Los Angeles 
amusement chain, and how I 
was going to convince him our 
printing prices were maybe a 
little higher but the quality 
and service were better. My 
mind wandered below where I 
was sitting, idly moving from 
one piece of luggage to an- 
other, looking for my beat-up 
suitcase. I went through slips 
and slippers, lingerie and 
laundry, a jig saw puzzle and 
a ukulele. 

I never did find my suitcase 
because I found the bomb first. 

T he bomb was in a small 
bag — a woman’s bag judg- 
ing by the soft, flimsy things 
you’d never find in a man’s — 
and I didn’t know it was a 
bomb right away. I thought it 
was just a clock, one of those 
small, quiet alarms. I was go- 
ing to pass it by and go on, but 
what held me was that some- 
thing was taped to it. By the 

54 



feel, I knew it must be electri- 
cian’s tape. Interested and 
curious, I explored the clock 
more closely, found two wires. 
One went to a battery and the 
other to hard round cylinders 
taped together. The hairs 
stood up at the base of my 
neck when I suddenly realized 
what it was. 

The clock’s balance wheel 
was rocking merrily. Quickly 
I went up past the train of 
gears to the alarm wheel. If 
this was anything like my own 
alarm clock, this one had 
something like ten minutes to 
go. 

It was forty minutes to 
Burbank and Lockheed Air 
Terminal. 

My mind was churning 
when I turned from the win- 
dow to look around at the un- 
concerned passengers, the 
woman at my side asleep 
again. I thought: Which one 
of these . No, none of them 
would know it was there. I 
glanced out the window again ; 
clouds were still in the way. 
We’d be leaving the valley for 
the mountain range north of 
Los Angeles soon, if we hadn’t 
left it already. No place to 
land the plane there. 

But of course that had been 
the plan ! 

My heart was beating in 
jackhammer rhythm ; my 
mouth was dry and my mind 
was numb. Tell somebody 
about the bomb before it’s too 
late ! No, they’d think I put it 
there. Besides, what good 

JERRY SOHL 




would it do? There would be 
panic and they’d never get the 
plane down in time — if they 
believed me. 

“Sir.” My head jerked 
around. The stewardess stood 
in the aisle, smiling, extending 
a tray to me, a brown plastic 
tray bearing a small paper cup 
of tomato juice, a cup of cof- 
fee, a cellophane-wrapped 
doughnut, paper spoon, sugar 
and dehydrated cream enve- 
lopes, and a napkin. 

I goggled at her, managed 
to croak, “No, thanks.” She 
gave me an odd look and 
moved along. My seatmate had 
accepted hers and was tearing 
at the cellophane. I couldn’t 
bear to watch her. 

I closed my eyes, forced my 
mind back to the luggage com- 
partment, spent a frantic mo- 
ment before I found the bag 
again. I had to stop that bal- 
ance wheel, just as I stopped 
my alarm clock every morn- 
ing. I tried to close everything 
off — the throb of engines, the 
rush of air, the woman sip- 
ping coffee noisily beside me — 
and I went into the clock and 
surrounded the seesawing 
wheel. When it went forward, 
I pulled it back ; when it went 
back, I pulled it forward. I 
struggled with it, and it was 
like trying to work with 
greasy hands, and I was afraid 
I wasn’t going to be able to 
stop it. 

Then, little by little, it start- 
ed to slow its beat. But I could 
not afford to relax. I pushed 



and pulled and didn’t dare re- 
lease my hold until it came to 
a dead stop. 

“Anything the matter?” 

My eyelids flew open and I 
looked into the eyes of the 
woman next to me. There was 
sugar from the doughnut 
around her mouth and she was 
still chewing. 

“No,” I said, letting out my 
breath. “I’m all right.” 

“You were moaning, it 
sounded like. And you kept 
moving your head back and 
forth.” 

“Must have been dream- 
ing,” I said as I rang for the 
stewardess. When she came I 
told her I’d take some of that 
coffee now. No, nothing else, 
just coffee. I didn’t tell her 
how much I needed it. I sat 
there clammy with sweat until 
she returned. Coffee never 
tasted so good. 

A ll right, so I had stopped 
the bomb’s timer. My 
mind raced ahead to the land- 
ing. When they unloaded the 
luggage, the balance wheel 
would start again. I wouldn’t 
be able to stay with it, keeping 
it still. I considered telling the 
authorities as soon as we land- 
ed, or maybe calling in ahead, 
but wouldn’t that just bring 
suspicion, questions. Maybe I 
could convince them I could 
stop a clock — ^but not before 
the bomb exploded. And then 
what? My secret would be out 
and my life would be changed. 
I’d be a man not to be trusted. 



THE LimE RED BAG 



55 




a prying man, a man literally 
with gimlet eyes. 

Mountain crags jutted 
through the clouds. We Were 
in the range north of the city. 
Here and there were clear 
spots and I could see roads be- 
low, but there were also clouds 
far above us. It was very beau- 
tiful, but it was also very 
bumpy, and we started to slip 
and slide. 

To my horror I found that 
the balance wheel was rocking 
again. Closing my eyes and 
gritting my teeth, I forced my 
senses to the wheel, tugging 
and pulling and shoving and 
pushing until it finally stop- 
ped. 

A jab in the shoulder. I 
jumped, startled. 

“Your cup,” my seat part- 
ner said, pointing. 

I looked down at the coffee 
cup I had crushed in my 
hands. Then I looked up into 
the eyes of the stewardess. I 
handed it to her. She took it 
without a word and went 
away. 

“Were you really asleep that 
time ?” 

“Not really,” I said. I was 
tempted to tell the woman 
I was subject to fits, but I 
didn’t. 

It was only a few minutes to 
landing, but they became the 
longest minutes of my life as 
time after time I stopped the 
rocking wheel when the plane 
dipped and bumped to a land- 
ing. 

Leaving the apron with the 
56 



other passengers, I tried to 
walk as unconcernedly as they 
through the exit gate. I would 
have liked walking through 
the terminal and out the en- 
trance and away, but I could 
not. I had my suitcase to get, 
for one thing. The damned 
bomb was the other. So I 
strolled out into the concourse 
again to look at the plane and 
watch the baggagemen at 
work, transferring the lug- 
gage to two airfield carts. 
They weren’t as careful as I 
would have been. 

It was impossible to tell 
from this distance just which 
bag contained the bomb; I 
could hardly identify my own 
scarred suitcase. The assort- 
ment of bags — a strange con- 
glomeration of sizes and colors 
— was packed in some places 
six deep, and it rolled toward 
the gate where I was standing. 
I didn’t know whether to stay 
or run, imagining the balance 
wheel now happily rocking 
again. The load went past me 
down a ramp to the front of 
the air terminal where the 
luggage was unloaded and 
placed in a long rack. I went 
with it. 

There was a flurry of ticket 
matching, hands grabbing for 
suitcases, and a general ex- 
odus on the part of my fellow 
passengers, too fast to deter- 
mine who had got the one with 
the bomb. Now all that was 
left was the attendant and I 
had two bags — my own batter- 
ed veteran of years, and a fine 

JERRY SOHL 




new red overnight case, small 
enough to be the one. 

I lit a cigarette, reached out. 
Inside were a woman’s things 
and — a clock. The escapement 
was clicking vigorously. 

I didn’t moan this time. I 
just closed my eyes, stretched 
toward and grabbed the bal- 
ance wheel I was getting to 
know like my own. I entered 
into a union with it so strong 
that after I had reduced it to 
immobility, it was like waking 
when I opened my eyes. 

T he baggage claim attend- 
ant was staring at me. For 
only a moment I stared back. 
Then I quickly reached for my 
baggage check and presented 
it to him. His hand hovered 
over the handle of the little 
red bag and I was ready to 
yell at him. But then, match- 
ing numbers on the tags with 
his eyes, his hand grasped the 
handle of my own suitcase and 
pushed it toward me. 

“Thanks,” I said, taking it. 
I glanced ever so casually to- 
ward the remaining bag. “One 
left over, eh?” 

“Yeah.” He was so bored I 
was tempted to tell him what 
was in it. But he was eying 
me with a “well-why-don’t- 
you-get-along?” look. 

I said, “What happens if 
nobody claims it?” 

“Take it inside. Why?” 

He was getting too curious. 
“Oh, I just wondered, that’s 
all.” 

I stepped on my cigarette 
THE LIHLE RED BAG 



and walked toward the air ter- 
minal entrance and put my 
suitcase on the stone steps 
there. A redcap came hurrying 
over. 

“Cab?” 

I shook my head. “Just wait- 
ing.” 

Just waiting for somebody 
to pick up a bomb. 

I lit another cigarette and 
glanced now and then toward 
the baggage claim area. The 
red bag was still there. All 
sorts of theories ran through 
my head as to why it should 
still be there, and none satis- 
fied me. 

I should not have been 
there, that much I knew; I 
should be with a man named 
Amos Magaffey on Sixth 
Street at ten o’clock, discuss- 
ing something very mundane, 
the matter of a printing order. 
But what could I do? If I left 
the airport, the attendant 
would eventually take the bag 
inside and there would be an 
explosion, and I wouldn’t be 
able to live with myself. 

No. I had to stay to keep the 
balance wheel stationary until 
— until what? 

A man in tan gabardine, 
wearing a police cap and 
badge, walked out of the en- 
trance to stand on the stone 
steps beside me while he put 
on a pair of dark glasses. A 
member of the airport police 
detail. I could tell him. I could 
take him down to the little red 
bag and explain the whole 
thing. Then it would be his 

57 




baby and I would be off on my 
own business. 

But he moved on down the 
steps, nodded at the redcap, 
and started across the street 
to the parking area. I could 
have called to him, “Hey, offi- 
cer, let me tell you about a 
bomb in a little red bag.” But 
I didn’t. I didn’t because I 
caught a movement at the bag- 
gage claim counter out of the 
side of my eye. 

The attendant had picked up 
the bag and was walking with 
it up the ramp to the rear of 
the air terminal. Picking up 
my own suitcase, I went inside 
in time to see him enter 
through a side door and de- 
posit the bag on the scales at 
the airline desk and say some- 
thing to the clerk. The clerk 
nodded and moved the bag to 
the rear room. 

I could visualize the balance 
wheel once again rocking like 
crazy. How many minutes — 
or seconds — were left? I was 
sweating when I moved to the 
counter, and it wasn’t because 
of the sunshine I’d been soak- 
ing in. I had to get as close to 
the bag as I could if I was go- 
ing to stop the clock again. 

“Can I help you?” the clerk 
asked. 

“No. I’m waiting for some- 
one.” 

I turned my back to him, 
put down my suitcase, leaned 
against the counter and reach- 
ed out for the wheel. I found I 
could reach the device, but it 
was far away. When I tried to 

^8 



dampen it, the wheel escaped 
my grasp. 

“Do you have my suitcase?” 

I blinked my eyes open and 
looked around. The blonde in 
the plane stood there looking 
very fresh and bright and un- 
concerned. In her right hand 
she had a green baggage claim 
check. 

The clerk took it, nodded, 
and in a moment brought out 
the overnight case and set it 
on the scales. The girl thanked 
him, picked it up, glanced at 
me indiffei’ently, and then 
started for the entrance with 
it. 

“Just a moment,” I found 
myself saying, grabbing my 
bag and hurrying after her. 

A t her side and a little 
ahead of her, I said, “Lis- 
ten to me.” 

She looked annoyed and in- 
creased her stride toward the 
door. 

“It’s a matter of life or 
death,” I said. I wanted to 
wrest the bag from her and 
hurl it out through the door- 
way into the street, but I re- 
strained myself. 

She stopped and stared. I 
noticed a short, fat man in a 
rumpled suitcoat and unpress- 
ed pants staring, too. Ignoring 
him, I said, “Please put the 
bag down. Over there.” I indi- 
cated a spot beside a telephone 
booth where it would be out of 
the way. 

She didn’t move. She just 
said, “Why?” 



JERRY SOHL 




“For God’s sake !’’ I took the 
case. She offered no resistance. 

I put her bag and mine next to 
the booth. When I turned 
around she was standing there 
looking at me as if I had gone 
out of my mind. Her eyes were 
blue and brown-flecked, very 
pretty eyes, and my thought at 
the moment was. I’m glad the 
bomb didn’t go off ; these eyes 
wouldn’t be looking at me or 
anything else right now if it 
had. 

“I’ve got to talk to you. It’s 
very important.” 

The girl said, “Why?” I was 
beginning to think it was the 
only word she knew. At the 
same time I was wondering 
why anyone would want to kill 
someone so lovely. 

“I’ll explain in a moment. 
Please stand right here while 
I make a telephone call.” I 
moved toward the phone 
booth, paused and said, “And 
don’t ask me why.” 

She gave me a speculative 
look. 

I must not have seemed 
a complete idiot because she 
said, “All right, but — ” 

I didn’t listen for the rest. I 
went into the booth, closed the 
door, pretended to drop a coin 
and dial a number. But all the 
time I was in there, I was 
reaching out through the glass 
for the clock. At this range it 
wasn’t difficult to stop the bal- 
ance wheel. 

Just the same, when I came 
out I was wringing wet. 

“Now will you please tell me 



what this is all about?” she 
said stiffly. 

“Gladly. Let me buy you a 
cup of coffee and I’ll explain.” 

She glanced at the bags. I 
told her they’d be all right. We 
followed the short, fat man 
into the coffee shop. 

Over coffee I explained it all 
to her, how I had this extra- 
sensory ability, how she was 
the first person I had ever re- 
vealed it to, and how I had dis- 
covered what was in her over- 
night bag. 

During the telling, her un- 
touched coffee grew a skin, 
her face grew pale, her eyes 
grew less curious and more 
troubled. There were tears 
there when I finished. I asked 
her who put the bomb in her 
bag. 

“Joe did,” she said in a tone- 
less voice, not looking at me 
any more but staring vacantly 
across the room. “Joe put it 
there.” Behind her eyes she 
was reliving some recent 
scene. 

“Who is Joe?” 

“My husband.” I thought 
she was going to really bawl, 
but she got control again. 
“This trip was his idea, my 
coming down here to visit my 
sister.” Her smile was bleak. 
“I see now why he wanted to 
put in those books. I’d finished 
packing and was in the bath- 
room. He said he’d put in some 
books we’d both finished read- 
ing — for my sister. That’s 
when he must have put the — 
put it in there.” 



THE LintE RED BAG 



59 




I said gently, “Why would 
he want to do a thing like 
that?” 

“I don’t know.” She shook 
her head. “I just don’t know.” 
And she was close to bawling 
again. Then she recovered and 
said, “I’m not sure I want to 
know.” I admired her for say- 
ing it. Joe must have been 
crazy. 

“It’s all right now?” she 
asked. 

I nodded. “A long as we 
don’t move it.” 

I told her I didn’t know how 
much more time there was, 
that I’d been thinking it over 
and that the only way out 
seemed to be to tell the airport 
policeman. After I explained 
it to her, the girl — she said 
her name was Julia Claremont 
— ^agreed to tell him she 
thought there was a bomb in 
her bag, that she had noticed a 
ticking and had become wor- 
ried because she knew she 
hadn’t packed a clock. It 
wasn’t good, but it would have 
to do. 

“We’ve got to get it deac- 
tivated,” I said, watching the 
fat man pay for his coffee and 
leave. “The sooner the better.” 

I FINISHED my coffee in 
one gulp and went to pay 
the bill with her. I asked her 
why she didn’t claim the bag 
at the same time the other 
people had. She said she had 
called her sister and the phone 
was busy for a long while. 
“She was supposed to meet 



me, and when she wasn’t here, 
I got worried. She said she 
isn’t feeling well and asked me 
to take a cab.” She smiled a 
little. It was a bright, cheery 
thing. I had the feeling it was 
all for me. “That’s where I 
was going when you caught up 
with me.” 

It had become a very nice 
day. But the bottom dropped 
out of it again when we reach- 
ed the lobby. 

The two bags weren’t there. 

I ran to the entrance and 
nearly collided with the red- 
cap. 

“See anybody go out of here 
with a little red bag and an old 
battered suitcase?” 

“Bag? Suitcase?” he mum- 
bled. Then he became excited. 
“Why, a man just stepped out 
of here — ” He turned to look 
down the street. “That’s him.” 

The dumpy man I’d seen 
was walking off; Julia’s bag 
in his right hand, mine in his 
left. He seemed in no hurry. 

“Hey!” I shouted, starting 
toward him. 

The man turned, took one 
look at me, and started to run. 
He came abreast an old gray, 
mud-spattered coupe, ran 
around, opened the door and 
threw both bags into the rear 
seat as he got in. 

The car was a hundred feet 
away and gathering speed by 
the time I reached where it 
had been parked, I watched it 
for a moment, then walked 
back to the entranceway 
where Julia was standing with

They went somewhere and something happened to 



H unched tensely over the 
foot of the bed, Bradford 
Sanderson stared down at the 
unconscious sergeant. There 
was a heavy stillness in the 
hospital room. Outside, beyond 



was to go there 



the window, the sun-splashed 
expanse of the Army medical 
base stretched away toward 
the glaring beach and the 
shimmering Gulf waters be- 
yond.

Last Leap 



By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



them — and the one way to find out where and what 



and let it happen! 



The door opened and closed 
softly, admitting a lean and 
erect Medical Corps colonel. 

“Has he come around yet, 
Doctor?” he asked in an un- 
easy whisper. 



Dr. Sanderson shook his 
head. “No, but he’s sleeping 
lightly. He’ll be awake in a 
minute.” 

“Think you’ll do any better 
with this one?” The colonel’s 



65 




voice sharpened to an appre- 
hensive edge. 

“I intend to take all precau- 
tions, Dr. Vickers. I don’t 
think we’ll lose McNaught.” 

“God, I hope not,” Vickers 
said, relieved only a little. 
“We’ve already got the Bu- 
reau breathing down our 
necks over the first two — ah 
— accidents.” 

“I’m sure we have nothing 
to fear this time,” said San- 
derson. 

For his forty-eight years 
and despite the flecks of gray 
in his hair, there was a pre- 
served air of youthfulness 
about the physicist. Stocky 
and in obvious good trim, ho 
presented an appearance that 
belied his professional status. 

The door opened and closed 
again, as softly as before, and 
a woman whose dense black 
hair contrasted her Army 
nurse’s uniform came and 
stood between the two men. 
Slightly built and attractive, 
she fixed the slumbering ser- 
geant with an anxious stare. 

Vickers glanced at the hypo- 
dermic syringe in her hand. 
“Sodium pentothal. Miss Con- 
ner ly?” 

She nodded without looking 
at him. “Two hundred cc.” 

Drawing in a deep breath, 
the sergeant rolled over and 
buried his head luxuriously in 
the pillow. The movement, 
however, did little to dishevel 
his bristly blond hair. His eyes 
flicked open and he stared ab- 
stractedly at the others. Then 



he smiled and his lips parted 
to form a word. 

“Easy now!” Sanderson 
cautioned. “Don’t think about 
anything! Just keep your 
mind blank!” 

A ll expression drained 
from the sergeant’s face. 
His naturally ruddy features 
blanched imperceptibly, as 
though he had remembered 
something of appalling con- 
sequences. 

Colonel Vickers and Miss 
Connerly moved precautiously 
away from the bed. 

“Did it take?” McNaught 
asked, sitting up. 

“That’s what we’re going to 
find out now,” Sanderson re- 
plied. “And that’s all we’re 
going to find out.” 

Exploring the floor, Mc- 
Naught’s feet found and 
squirmed into his slippers. 
Then he rose, straightened his 
pajama blouse and reached for 
his robe. He was a tall, well- 
proportioned man and his ex- 
cessive size was evident in the 
skimpy fit of the hospital gar- 
ments. 

“Take it slow,” Sanderson 
soothed again, backing off be- 
fore the sergeant. “Just do as 
we say — nothing else.” 

McNaught tightened the 
robe sash and offered a smile 
that was intended to be reas- 
suring. “If you’re thinking 
about Watterman and Fish- 
er,” he said lightly, “they’ll be 
back. They just took French 
leave and — ”

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




“Blank, Sergeant !” San- 
derson cut in. “We don’t want 
you thinking of anything that 
might make you pop away im- 
pulsively. Now — are you all 
set?” 

Miss Connerly strained for- 
ward, her intense gray eyes 
vigilant with restrained ap- 
prehension. 

Vickers glanced uncertainly 
behind him and eased back. 

Sanderson stepped to one 
side, as though it might be 
necessary to get out of the ser- 
geant’s way. “The opposite 
comer of the room — and 
that’s all,” he directed. 
“Ready Go!” 

Instantly there was a double 
thunderclap of minor inten- 
sity — like two distant jets 
slipping through the sound 
barrier — as McNaught disap- 
peared from where he was 
standing and reappeared sim- 
ultaneously in the designated 
corner. 

The sergeant turned and 
faced Sanderson triumphant- 
ly. “It works!” 

But the physicist sprang 
across the room, signaling for 
Miss Connerly at the same 
time. 

“Let him have the injec- 
tion!” he told the nurse. 
“Easy, son. Everything’s go- 
ing to be all right. Just don’t 
think! Dr. Vickers, help me 
bring him back across the 
room.” 

The injection took effect al- 
most immediately and it re- 
quired the efforts of both men 



to get McNaught comfortably 
positioned in bed. 

Sanderson shook his head 
briskly, trying to clear the 
ringing in his ears. And he 
wondered whether he would 
ever get used to the unexpect- 
ed explosions that resulted as 
air rushed into the suddenly 
vacated space and was abrupt- 
ly expelled from the newly 
occupied one. 

L ater that evening, Vick- 
' ers paced nervously in 
Sanderson’s office while San- 
derson chronicled the day’s 
incidents in his official record 
book. 

Unsettled by the colonel’s 
restlessness, he paused and 
looked up irately. “I wouldn’t 
worry too much about Mc- 
Naught. He’s going to do all 
right.” 

“That’s what you said about 
Watterman and Fisher.” 

“But the sergeant has good 
control. He knows the mean- 
ing of the word restraint.” 
Vickers cast him an uncon- 
vinced glance and continued 
pacing. “That’s the way it was 
with Watterman and Fisher — 
at first. They went slow. They 
had a lot of respect for tele- 
portation — until they started 
throwing caution to the wind 
and went popping all over the 
place.” 

Sanderson rose, packing his 
pipe bowl with a crooked 
thumb. “McNaught’s fore- 
warned by the disappearances 
of the first two subjects. You 

67 



THE LAST LEAP 




can be sure he’s going to be 
damned careful.” 

Vickers leaned backward 
against the desk and folded his 
arms, while the physicist lit 
his pipe and raised a thick 
white cloud of fragrant smoke 
between them. 

“What do you suppose hap- 
pened to Watterman and Fish- 
er?” the colonel asked grimly. 

“That’s what McNaught is 
going to help us find out.” 

“Collision with something 
solid?” 

Sanderson shook his head. 
“You don’t pass through any- 
thing en route from one place 
to another.” 

“I mean in the remateriali- 
zation. Maybe Watterman and 
Fisher popped up in a space 
that was already occupied.” 

“Impossible. Watterman 
cleared that for us months 
ago. He proved rematerializa- 
tion can take place only in 
gaseous spaces or attenuated 
liquids. He even tried to reap- 
pear within a brick wall. The 
best he could do was to pop out 
next to it.” 

Still, Vickers was not molli- 
fied. His thin, rough hands ri- 
gidly gripped the edge of the 
desk behind him as he stood 
there with one leg crossed 
over the other. He shook his 
bowed head regretfully and 
the light from the cortical ex- 
citation laboratory in the next 
room sent glistening high- 
lights dancing across his slick 
scalp. ' 

“Maybe they popped off to a 



polar region and froze to 
death,” he speculated sourly. 

“That; too, is highly unlike- 
ly. There’s a lot of reflex 
action involved. Waterman, 
after his second excitation, did 
go to the Arctic, you’ll remem- 
ber. He was only there about 
three seconds — long enough 
for the cold to begin s^ping 
in — before he found himself 
back in his room. Fisher even 
tried a surge into space, with- 
out any injury at all. His re- 
action to a vacuum was so 
spontaneous that I don’t im- 
agine he spent more than a 
hundredth of a second out 
there.” 

Nodding absently, Vickers 
lighted a cigarette with un- 
steady hands while Sanderson 
returned to his record book. 
But the physicist only sat 
there staring thoughtfully 
through the surface of the 
desk, pen poised over the lined 
paper. 

W ATTERMAN had gone 
first. There had been his 
initial reaction to cortical ex- 
citation — uncertainty, per- 
haps even a tinge of fear. His 
leaps during the first day 
were executed with a gingerly 
reluctance. By the second day, 
however, he had overcome all 
his qualms. And before the 
stimulated frontal region of 
his brain had returned to nor- 
mal at the end of the third 
day, he had materialized in 
four different sections of the 
country.

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




It was after his second ex- 
posure to the multiple-fre- 
quency stimulus a month later, 
however, that he had lost him- 
self in an orgy of teleportive 
experiences, cropping up in so 
many places throughout the 
country and abroad that the 
story had to be released. 

Only then did the public be- 
come aware that, under direct 
subsidy of the Bureau of Re- 
search, Bradford Sanderson's 
previous experiments in ex- 
citing telepathy had been in- 
geniously expanded to include 
teleportive ability. It was 
Watterman's materialization 
at the United States Moon 
Base, the physicist recalled, 
that had forced the Bureau to 
release the findings of the ex- 
periment in order to avert 
panic. 

The next day — that was five 
months ago, Sanderson recall- 
ed as he pulled pensively on 
his pipe — Watterman had dis- 
appeared, literally, complete- 
ly, permanently. He had left 
behind only a vacuous tran- 
quility in the hospital room, 
ruffled solely by rustling cur- 
tains that quietly altered the 
pattern of sunlight on the floor 
as they swayed with the Gulf 
breeze. 

With Fisher, it had been 
different. Sanderson had ques- 
tioned his selection as a volun- 
teer. Thin and fidgety, he had 
definitely turned out to be the 
excitable type. And exposure 
to the catalytic frequencies 
had only heightened his ner- 



vousness to the extent that 
before he disappeared he had 
even shown psychotic ten- 
dencies. 

His teleportive leaps had 
been few indeed and were exe- 
cuted only after inordinate 
coaxing. Only once during his 
entire phase had he shown any 
initiative. That was on his 
jump into empty space. But 
even afterward — until he had 
vanished permanently from 
under a shade umbrella on the 
beach several hours later — ^he 
had disclaimed any intent in 
the feat. Rather, he had in- 
sisted that it was the result of 
an “auto-suggestive impulse.” 

With McNaught, though, it 
would be different, Sanderson 
promised himself. The ser- 
geant was as perfectly balanc- 
ed, mentally, as any person 
he had ever known. 

'T wonder,” Vickers said, 
stubbing out his cigarette in 
the ash tray, “whether Wat- 
terman and Fisher will ever 
be heard from again.” 

“I like to think they will.” 
Sanderson cupped his hands 
around the warmth of his pipe 
bowl. “I tell myself that in 
both cases, and perhaps coin- 
cidentally, they were stranded 
in remote areas just as the ef- 
fects of the stimulative fre- 
quencies wore off.” 

“That could have been the 
case with Watterman,” the 
colonel admitted. “He disap- 
peared toward the end of his 
second three-day period. But 
Fisher was in phase less than 

69 



THE LAST LEAP 




a day and a half when it hap- 
pened to him.” 

“Maybe the stimulation 
wasn’t as strong in Fisher’s 
case.” 

“Maybe,” said Sanderson. 

Vickers turned to leave, but 
paused near the door. “By the 
way, the Under Secretary of 
Research is due in tomorrow 
morning.” 

“Peabody? What does he 
want?” 

“Mainly to keep abreast of 
what’s going on. If we lose 
McNaught, he probably has 
orders to put his foot down on 
your work.” 

“That’s bad. I didn’t want 
any interference during the 
sergeant’s three-day phase. As 
a matter of fact, I’d planned 
to have him spend most of to- 
morrow on the beach. That’ll 
help keep his mind occupied.” 

Vickers shrugged. “You’ll 
have to see Peabody first.” 

U NDER SECRETARY of 
Research Sylvester A. 
Peabody was impressive both 
in size and proclivity to impo- 
sition. The adjectives “Wash- 
ington” and “bureaucratic” 
were stamped all over him — in 
the intolerant set of his jaw, 
the disdainful sharpness of his 
eyes, his mannerism of wield- 
ing an otherwise nonfunc- 
tional pair of glasses to stress 
a point. 

He had taken possession of 
Sanderson’s desk by the next 
morning and, for the better 
part of an hour, had thumbed 

70 



through the day-by-day chro- 
nology on all the experimental 
work. 

He looked up abruptly. “So 
now it’s Number Three?” 

Annoyed over the loss of 
time, Sanderson said nothing. 

“And what makes you think 
we’ll fare any better with this 
new subject?” Peabody asked. 

“For one thing, I altered 
three of the basic frequen- 
cies,” the physicist explained 
wearily. “There may be a cor- 
relation between some of the 
ultra-wave forms and the feel- 
ing of a compulsion to tele- 
port.” 

The undersecretary rose 
and thumped his knuckles 
with the spectacles. “As I un- 
derstand it, both Fisher and 
Watterman said that at times 
they felt this almost uncon- 
trollable impulse to — as you 
say — ^make a leap.” 

Sanderson nodded. “Watter- 
man found himself jumping 
on several occasions when he 
merely thought about another 
location.” 

“And you believe you’ve 
corrected this rashness in 
McNaught?” 

“Sergeant McNaught went 
through extensive ti*aining 
and thorough conditioning for 
two months before exposure. 
I consider him well insulated 
against any whimsical use of 
his ability.” 

Peabody struck a pose of 
thoughtfulness as he stared 
out the window. 

Impatiently, Sanderson 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




checked his watch. It was al- 
most noon and he had thus far 
managed to spend only two 
hours with the new subject. 
But it had been a most re- 
warding two hours. Mc- 
Naught had executed over a 
dozen controlled leaps, two of 
them covering distances of 
better than a mile. And if the 
sergeant had felt any inner 
elation over the experiences, 
he had not shown it. Exhibit- 
ing only a purely impersonal 
approach to the manifestation, 
he hadn’t taken a single impul- 
sive leap. 

But if Sanderson was going 
to continue with his planned 
program of sensible indoctri- 
nation for McNaught, he re- 
alized, he would have to break 
away from Peabody soon. For 
nearly a third of the ser- 
geant’s three-day phase had 
already been used up and as 
yet he had been subjected to 
nothing but a false, laboratory 
environment. 

The undersecretary turned 
and spoke with a precise, 
meaningful inflection. “If you 
lose this third subject, San- 
derson, your project is going 
to be indefinitely abandoned.’’ 

“McNaught’s secure.” 

“As I understood it, so were 
the first two.” 

“You’ll have to admit that 
it’s possible they may have 
simply taken French leave — 
Watterman because he was 
naturally frivolous and Fisher 
because he was afi’aid.” 

“That’s just the point!” 



Peabody banged the desk. “Do 
you realize that for months 
now security has been sweat- 
ing? Don’t you see what it 
would mean if the details of 
your work fell into hostile 
hands?” 

“It can’t happen. Wherever 
they go, the subjects take no 
knowledge of the process with 
them.” 

S anderson didn’t man- 
age to get away with Ser- 
geant McNaught and Miss 
Connerly until almost three 
that afternoon. But that was 
just as well, he conceded as he 
helped unpack the chairs, um- 
brella, lunch basket and bra- 
zier at the beach. The hottest 
part of the day was behind 
them now and cool offshore 
breezes were beginning to 
moderate the tepid glare of 
white sand and glistening 
water. 

Eventually, the physicist 
settled down in one of the 
chairs, fished in his pockets 
for his pipe, and began plan- 
ning a series of more ambi- 
tious leaps for the sergeant 
to perform later that after- 
noon. 

McNaught shed his polo 
shirt and helped the nurse off 
with her beach robe. 

“Come on, Kate,” he chal- 
lenged. “I’ll race you to the 
water.” 

Sanderson watched the cou- 
ple sprint away while the sun 
played softly against their 
lithe forms. But several yards 

71 



THE LAST LEAP 




from the water McNaught 
swerved to spare the architec- 
tural integrity of a deserted 
sand castle, lost his balance 
and toppled. Miss Connerly, 
unmindful of the sergeant’s 
mishap, raced on, splashing 
through the shallow water and 
plunging headlong into a 
fi'othy breaker. 

At once there was a muf- 
fled double explosion as Mc- 
Naught vanished from where 
he had sprawled on the sand 
and rematerialized in the wa- 
ter beside the girl. And, ac- 
commodating his impetuous 
entry, the water shot outward 
and upward in a geyserlike 
spray. 

Sanderson bolted from his 
chair and raced across the 
beach. Scarcely aware that he 
was in water above his shoes, 
he cupped his hands and 
shouted, “I didn’t tell you to 
leap!” 

“I didn’t either.” McNaught 
displayed a confused frown. 
‘‘It just sort of — happened.” 

Sanderson stiffened. Was 
this a first indication of capri- 
cious reaction? Was Mc- 
Naught losing his detached 
calmness? Was he headed the 
same way as Watterman and 
Fisher ? 

‘‘You’d better come on in,” 
Sanderson said. 

“I’m sure he’ll be all right. 
Dr. Sanderson,” the nurse in- 
terceded. “It wouldn’t have 
happened if I hadn’t encour- 
aged that spurt of exertion.” 

Perhaps she was right, the 



physicist granted hopefully. 
After all, reaction could only 
be expected to become reflex- 
ive to a certain degree during 
physical activity. 

Still, he went back to the 
station wagon, opened the 
glove compartment, took out 
the hypodermic syringe case 
and put it in his hip pocket. 

E arly that evening, while 
Sanderson was fanning 
the coals in the brazier, Mc- 
Naught and Miss Connerly 
returned from a twilight walk 
along the beach. 

They stood on the other 
side of the fire for a long 
while, letting the lambent 
glow cast a mantle of ruddi- 
ness across their features. 

“I think we’re making ex- 
cellent headway,” the physi- 
cist enthused, spearing three 
wieners with a fork and sub- 
jecting them to the heat of the 
coals. “I particularly like the 
way you’re showing restraint. 
By this time Watterman was 
hopping all over the country.” 
With satisfaction, he 
thought back over the experi- 
ments he had put McNaught 
through late that afternoon. 
He had negotiated leaps to the 
island, to a point several miles 
down the beach and to Colonel 
Vickers’ office and back. And, 
unlike the first two subjects, 
the sergeant had still shown 
no further tendency toward 
impulsive teleportation. 

Sanderson looked hastily 
over at the couple, realizing 



72 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




only then that there was a 
tense' silence between them. 
And now he saw that their 
faces were strained with un- 
certain expressions. 

“It — ^happened again,” the 
girl said awkwardly. 

Sanderson let the wieners 
drop to the sand. “Another 
involuntary hop? Where to 
this time?” 

“I just couldn’t help it,” 
McNaught apologized. “I was 
thinking about home — on the 
West Coast. We’ve got a beach 
just like this. And suddenly 
I was standing on it. I would 
not even have known the dif- 
ference if it hadn’t been for 
the fact that the sun was still 
shining over there.” 

“That settles it!” the physi- 
cist exclaimed. “Let’s get him 
back to the base, Kate. He’s 
going to sit out the I'est of his 
phase with a few hundred cc 
of pentothal!” 

McNaught gripped Sander- 
son’s sleeve. “I’ll be all right. 
Let me stick it out — for a few 
more hours, at least.” 

“I think Dr. Sanderson is 
right,” the girl said. “It’s best 
to play it safe.” She went over 
to retrieve her robe. 

McNaught, however, only 
stood staring down at the 
glowing coals. A large moth 
buzzed against his face, but 
even that failed to snap him 
from his thoughts. Sanderson 
reached out and took him ur- 
gently by the arm. 

But the sergeant pulled 
free, brushing the insect away 

THE UST LEAP 



at the same time. “No, waitl 
I think—” 

He paused and his eyes were 
vivid with sudden apprehen- 
sion. “I think I know what 
happened to Watterman and 
Fisher!” 

The physicist laced him 
with a questioning stare. 

McNaught lurched back. 
“No!” he shouted. “Don’t ask 
me! I can’t talk about it!” 

Sanderson lunged for him. 
But he vanished, reappeared 
a few feet away, moonlight 
glistening on his trembling 
shoulders. 

Kate raced toward him and 
he disappeared again, materi- 
alizing this time close to the 
physicist. And Sanderson was 
ready with the hypodermic. 

T he next morning the phys- 
icist’s dra'wn face showed 
the effects of a sleepless night 
as he called down for coffee 
and shaved in the lavatory ad- 
joining his office. 

When he went back to his 
desk, Vickers was in the room, 
looking haggard and nervous. 
The colonel’s tie was askew, 
and around his bald crown, his 
peripheral fringe of hair was 
ragged, like the leaves of a 
Roman chaplet. 

He dropped into a chair op- 
posite the desk. “At least I got 
rid of Peabody. He’s gone back 
to Washington.” 

Sanderson tensed. “You tell 
him what happened ?” 

“Of course not. I simply ex- 
plained that we cut the experi- 



73 




ment short to evaluate what 
we’ve observed thus far.” 

The physicist thrust his 
hands in his pockets and went 
to the window, looked out 
blindly, turned and came back, 
“I don’t understand it. I can’t 
imagine what unnerved Mc- 
Naught so completely last 
night.” 

“You should have pressed 
him for an explanation.” 
“No,” Sanderson disagreed. 
“I think that might have been 
disastrous. When he material- 
ized next to me — Klon’t you 
see? — he must have wanted 
that injection.” 

Vickers spread his hands. 
“What do we do now?” 

“Keep him under sedation 
until the effects of the fre- 
quency exposure wear off. We 
only have a little more than 
a day to sit it out. Then I’m 
going to re-examine every 
inch of theory.” 

He went over to his desk, 
opened the record book and 
wrote four or five lines. Then 
he looked up as Miss Connerly 
entered with the coffee he had 
requested. 

“I’m glad you’re here, 
Kate,” he said, relieved. 
“When did you give Mc- 
Naught that last injection? It 
was three o’clock, wasn’t it?” 
Pen poised over the next 
blank line, he waited for her 
answer. When he looked up 
finally, he saw only dismay on 
her face. 

“I thought — ” she began. 
“Didn’t you say — I mean, you 

74 



told me just after midnight 
that the other nurse would 
take care of it, didn’t you?” 
Sanderson sprang up. “I 
said she would prepare it ! She 
went off duty at two-thirty!” 
Lunging for the door, he 
brush^ against her, jolted the 
tray and sent coffee sloshing 
over the brims of the two 
cups. Vickers stayed close at 
his heels all the way down the 
corridor. 

McNaught’s room was emp- 
ty. 

The top sheet on his bed had 
been carelessly thrown back. 
An overturned glass of water, 
its puddle still dripping off the 
edge of the night table’s sur- 
face, suggested that he had 
only recently awakened. His 
robe was gone, as was one of 
his slippers. Sole up, the other 
lay halfway between the bed 
and the reading table. 

Sunlight splotched the sin- 
gle sheet of writing paper on 
the table. With an unsteady 
hand, Sanderson picked up the 
scrawled note : 

How can I warn anybody 
without even thinking about 
it? The urge to teleport can 
sneak up on you. It can also 
be an oveipowering compul- 
sion. But how can I teU you ? 
How can 1 keep myself from 
thinking about something, 
and at the same time write 
about what it is I’m not sup- 
posed to think about? I 
know what happened to 
Watterman and Fisher. 
They wen 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




The writing ended abruptly, 
as though the pen had been 
snatched cleanly up and away 
from the paper. 

I T WAS almost midnight 
that same day when Vick- 
ers, having searched Sander- 
son’s quarters and the hospital 
for the physicist, tried the 
laboratory on the strength of 
a hunch. 

In the doorway, the whining 
surge of energy in the excita- 
tion circuits drew a startled 
breath from the colonel. He 
plunged on into the room, rac- 
ing past the restless genera- 
tors, past the towering banks 
of rectifiers and oscillators, 
past the ultra-frequency con- 
verters. 

“You fool!” he shouted as 
he covered the remaining dis- 
tance to the excitation chair 
and began snatching elec- 
trodes from the band that cir- 
cled Sanderson’s forehead. 

He knocked aside the final 
three glowing parabolic reflec- 
tors. “You damned silly fool! 
What are you trying to do?” 
Sanderson felt no immedi- 
ate effects from the exposure, 
despite the fact that there had 
been no anesthetic. 

“It had to be done,” he said 
evenly. 

“Why? So you could go the 
same way Watterman and 
Fisher and McNaught went?” 
“I’ve got to know what hap- 
pened to them.” 

“It doesn’t make any differ- 
ence now.” Vickers appeared 



to be growing even more per- 
turbed. “The Bureau’s going 
to shut down the project any- 
way!” 

Sanderson rose and passed 
a hand over his forehead, fin- 
gering the impression left by 
the electrode band. “That’s 
just it. They’ll shut us down 
and we’ll never know what 
became of McNaught and the 
others.” 

“What do you expect to 
do?” 

“The same things they did, 
I guess,” the physicist said, 
shrugging. “I don’t suppose 
I’ll have any trouble duplicat- 
ing their final experience.” 

He stared at a cleared space 
in the opposite corner of the 
laboratory. And even before 
he could completely summon 
the intent to leap, he found 
himself at once on the other 
side of the room. 

Aghast, Vickers raced after 
him. “Sanderson — don’t! You 
aren’t even conditioned 
against impulsive jumps!” 

“That’s the way I want it,” 
the physicist said impassively. 
“All the preparations we went 
through with McNaught did 
no good. He still hopped — 
three times that we know of. 
So maybe I don’t care about 
self-restraint.” 

He leaped again, this time 
popping up in the doorway to 
his office. 

Hands spread in a suppli- 
cating gesture. Colonel Vick- 
ers followed. “Watterman was 
not interested in restraining 

75 



THE LAST LEAP 




himself. He leaped as much as 
he wanted. And he finally van- 
ished too.” 

“I don’t give a hang if I do 
disappear.” Sanderson turned 
away. “I’m going to find out 
where those others went. And 
the only way to do it is to take 
the same course they took and 
see what happens.” 

He flicked out of sight and 
ended the leap in the corridor 
outside his office. 

«^ANDERSON!” The colo- 
nel’s voice came excitedly 
from within the room. Then 
the door swung open and 
Vickers burst into the hall. 
"Call this crazy thing off! 
Look, I have an idea. In tele- 
porting from one place to an- 
other, you have to go through 
something, even though it 
seems instantaneous. Through 
some other plane of existence, 
perhaps. And maybe when you 
don’t come back — ^when the 
others didn’t come back — it 
was because they got stuck in 
between!” 

Sanderson turned his back. 
Immediately the corridor was 
erased from his vision, only to 
be replaced in the next instant 
by the ponderous railing of a 
concrete bridge and, beyond, 
a river whose dark waters 
sent wisps of mist into the 
chill air. On his left, the 
bridge abutment clung to the 
shore of the lie de la Cite and, 
farther in the distance, the 
Cathedral of Notre Dame’s 
great, slender spire rose 

76 



against the pink-gray dawn 
sky. 

A startled Parisian, wit- 
nessing the materialization, 
shouted a fervent “Mon 
Dieu!” and promptly got his 
foot caught in the spokes of 
his bicycle catapulting over 
the handle bars. 

At once Sanderson was back 
in the hallway with Vickers, 
who was shouting for Miss 
Connerly. 

The colonel lunged for him 
but missed as Sanderson tele- 
ported to a new position be- 
hind him. 

"For God’s sake!” Vickers 
shouted. “Stop it — ^just for a 
minute, anyway! I have an- 
other theory. What if the pro- 
tective reflex doesn’t always 
work? Maybe Fisher was just 
lucky when he was able to leap 
out of space immediately ! 
Suppose he returned to space 
later — and panicked before he 
remembered he could jump 
back to safety!” 

A sudden assault of violent 
suction and intense cold 
sprang in on Sanderson, as 
though he had been snatched 
up in a giant’s hand. In a 
shutterlike glimpse, he was 
fleetingly aware of a broad 
sweep of blackness, spangled 
with a myriad brilliant stars, 
of a vast, shadowy surface 
hundreds of miles below that 
shone softly in the light of a 
full moon. 

In the next instant he was 
standing on the beach not far 
from the spot where he had 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




picnicked with McNaught and 
Kate the day before. The same 
moon sent its light down to 
embrace him and he stood 
there in silent concentration. 

The last leap, he realized, 
had not been voluntary. Vick- 
ers had merely spoken about 
space and, on the strength of 
that suggestion, Sanderson 
had unintentionally duplicated 
Fisher's experience. 

So it had been spontaneous. 
So what? Maybe that was 
where they had made their 
mistake all along — in thinking 
that impulsive teleportation 
must be rigorously avoided. 
Maybe he should let himself 
go completely — leap whenever 
and as often as he could, with 
or without his volition, wher- 
ever his fancy led. 

Complete surrender to the 
impulse, wearing himself out 
in wild over indulgence — that 
might be the formula for es- 
tablishing teleportation on a 
totally conscious and control- 
lable plane. If you filled a man 
with food, it was only logical 
that he would have no appe- 
tite, wasn't it? 

Abruptly he was back in the 
hospital corridor. Only it was 
empty now. 

But not for long. 

V ICKERS darted out from 
the room that Fisher had 
occupied. ‘‘Miss Conn — " 

He spied Sanderson, 
paused, then came forward 
cautiously. But the physicist 
had already seen the hypoder- 



mic syringe v/hich Vickers 
was now trying to hide behind 
his back. 

There was a furtive sound 
in the other direction and 
Sanderson spun around. Kate 
was closing in on him from the 
rear with another hypoder- 
mic. 

But the visual impression 
of the nurse was blotted out 
and immediately replaced by 
a blaze of lights that sparkled 
against a background of glis- 
tening wet buildings and drip- 
ping sky. Then, in the fierce 
glow of a lightning bolt. Times 
Square stood out in eerie 
white clarity. Hunched under 
an umbrella, a man and wom- 
an in formal dress brushed 
past him and continued on 
down a Broadway that was al- 
most deserted in the thunder- 
storm. 

Leaping to New York, San- 
derson assured himself, had 
not been involuntary. This 
time he had predetermined his 
destination. 

And in a quick follow-up to 
establish the self-impelled na- 
ture of his movements, he tele- 
ported to the base of the 
Washington Monument, not- 
ing that there was no storm in 
the nation's capital ; to Fisher- 
man's Wharf in San Fran- 
cisco, where the moon was 
noticeably lower in the sky ; to 
State Street in the Chicago 
Loop, which he left as soon as 
he felt the first cold drops of 
rain. 

Then suddenly he was back 

77 



THE LAST LEAP 




in the quiet of Fisher’s room 
in the hospital, only now be- 
ginning to feel the first sensa- 
tions of exuberance over his 
far-ranging travels. But he 
repressed it, remembering his 
resolve to reject a sensation 
of exhilaration. If he was to 
learn what had happened to 
Watterman, Fisher and Mc- 
Naught, and return to tell 
about it, his attitude would 
have to be one of scientific 
objectivity. 

With a sudden rebirth of 
determination, he set out 
again — to a desolate polar ice 
field, remaining there until the 
severe cold pierced his cloth- 
ing like dagger points of fire 
— to the crest of the Koolau 
Mountain Range on Oahu, 
looking down first on sprawl- 
ing Honolulu and then at the 
sun sinking in the ocean be- 
yond — to London, where he 
stood at the base of Lord Nel- 
son’s Column in Trafalgar 
Square and watched the first 
faint splashes of dawn appear 
in the eastern sky — to a rug- 
ged peak in the Rockies, from 
which he enjoyed an enchant- 
ing view of the artificial, geo- 
metric brilliance of Denver. 

Exhausted, finally, he let 
himself return to the hospital 
room and took one final leap 
to the bed. He stretched him- 
self across its tightly drawn 
sheet and fell quickly asleep. 

C ERTAIN that it must have 
been at least half an eter- 
nity later, Sanderson finally 

78 



opened his eyes and turned his 
face away from the bright 
sunlight that was falling on 
his pillow. 

He reached over and rubbed 
his arm, realizing at once that 
it was sore from a number of 
needle punctures over a con- 
siderable period of time. 

He had thrown himself 
across the bed fully dressed, 
but he was now in a hospital 
gown and lay under the sheet. 
Someone, perhaps as a result 
of anxious waiting, had kept 
the desk calendar up to date. 
And he noted, as he had pre- 
viously suspected, that it was 
not the day after his exposure 
to the ultra-frequency excita- 
tion, but rather three days 
later. 

Still groggy, he reached 
over to the night table and 
poured himself a drink of wa- 
ter. Then, trying to keep his 
mind on immediate considera- 
tions, he sat up. 

Colonel Vickers strode 
briskly into the room and 
grinned when he saw Sander- 
son awake. “It’s about time 
you came around.” 

“I suppose you think I 
ought to thank you for pulling 
the rug out from under me the 
other night,” grumbled San- 
derson. 

Vickers shrugged. “Doesn't; 
matter.” 

“Suppose I’m not cured?” 
Sanderson suggested warily. 
“What if I decide to put my- 
self through another excita- 
tion treatment?” 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




“That doesn’t matter either 
— ^what you decide, I mean. 
Peabody’s been back. He or- 
dered the laboratory appara- 
tus dismantled.” 

“And has it been ?” the 
physicist asked. 

Vickers nodded, giving no 
indication that he had detected 
the note of amusement in San- 
derson’s voice. 

He came over and gripped 
Sanderson’s shoulder. “I know 
you’re pretty wobbly, so take 
it easy. Get up and around 
whenever you think you’re up 
to it. I’ll have a light breakfast 
sent in as a starter.” 

After the colonel had gone, 
Sanderson allowed himself a 
smug smile. It had all happen- 
ed as he had planned. First the 
exhausting workout during 
his initial couple of hqurs of 
teleporting. Then the long rest 
with its total lack of mental 
activity to allow time for him 
to become psychically attuned 
to the new ability without any 
further chance of overdoing 
it. 

And now here he was — con- 
scious and fresh and ready to 
embark on the second stage of 
his plan to learn what had 
happened to the other three 
subjects. He wondered how 
long it would be before Vick- 
ers found out he had given 
himself a strong enough ex- 
posure to the ultra-frequen- 
cies to insure a six-day tele- 
portive period instead of the 
usual three. 

But he was not ready for 



any more leaps now. He want- 
ed time to think — ^to evaluate 
his experiences and attitude, 
to compare them with those of 
Watterman and Fisher and 
McNaught. Then he would ap- 
ply logic to the overall phe- 
nomenon and see whether 
some obscure explanation of 
the disappearances wouldn’t 
suggest itself. 

Eventually, an orderly 
brought in the breakfast tray 
with its tomato juice, soft- 
boiled eggs, toast and coffee, 
and Sanderson dived vora- 
ciously into the meal. 

A fter he had finished, he 
complimented himself on 
the fact that he had not tele- 
ported involuntarily since his 
awakening. And this strength- 
ened the hope that his theory 
had been correct — that by al- 
lowing himself free rein with 
both deliberate and impulsive 
teleportation, he had exhaust- 
ed his inclination to uninten- 
tional leaping. 

He pushed the tray aside, 
put on his robe and slippers 
and walked over to the win- 
dow. And he stood there star- 
ing out through the brilliant 
morning glare at the handful 
of patients in deck chairs who 
were drinking in the sunlight 
on the convalescent porch. 

McNaught, he remembered 
quite clearly now, had solved 
the enigma. But in trying to 
get the warning across, he 
had somehow only hastened 
his final disappearance. 



THE LAST LEAP 



79 




Abruptly Sanderson was 
thinking back to the night be- 
fore the sergeant had penned 
his last frenzied words — to 
the beach scene in which the 
youth had practically gone 
berserk and had begged not to 
be pressed for his theory on 
what had happened to Watter- 
man and Fisher. 

Something — something that 
had occurred just before then, 
or perhaps it was merely 
something he had thought 
about — ^must have inspired 
the sergeant’s comprehension. 

Sanderson reached desper- 
ately into his memory of that 
night, trying to recall in detail 
what McNaught had said and 
done. But it was almost as 
though his mind were a blank. 
He was trying too hard, he 
supposed. And he longed for 
a cigarette so he could relieve 
his mind momentarily of the 
self-ipflicted ordeal. 

Instantly, he was standing 
before the night table and 
looking down at his pack of 
cigarettes. And his hope and 
confidence were immediately 
shattered. He hadn’t, after all, 
succeeded in quelling involun- 
tary teleportation. He was no 
better off, he sensed, than the 
other three had been before 
their disappearances. 

He felt a persistent desper- 
ation closing in on him. It was 
quite possible, he realized 
dismally, that he might soon 
face the necessity of solving 
the puzzle as the sole means of 
saving himself. 



The window of an automo- 
bile, driving along the road in 
front of the hospital, flashed 
an intense reflection into the 
room. Sanderson shielded his 
eyes against the sudden burst 
of light. 

And abruptly he was think- 
ing of McNaught again — on 
the beach, bending over the 
hot coals, insensitive to the 
fluttering of a moth in his 
face, finally becoming aware 
of the insect and then curious- 
ly following its swirling flight 
around the brazier. 

Sanderson fell back against 
the bed, astonished and terri- 
fied. 

Good God ! It wasn’t — it 
couldn't be — 

Not that! 

Even as his thoughts turned 
entranced toward the concept, 
he lashed them down with a 
frantic surge of resistance. 
He wouldn’t think about it! 
The mere approach of the 
idea to his consciousness 
would mean the end. Yet he 
knew that ultimately it would 
be impossible to keep the hyp- 
notically compelling thought 
from his mind. 

He forced his concentration 
into another channel — to Mc- 
Naught’s note that had hope- 
lessly asked : 

. , How can I keep myself 
from thinking about some- 
thing and, at the same time, 
write about what it is Vm 
not supposed to think 
about? , .

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




There was only despair in 
the realization that now he, 
too, faced the same paradoxi- 
cal predicament. Not that he 
intended writing a warning; 
that wasn’t necessary, since 
there would be no more exper- 
imental subjects. But he 
would have to find a way of 
getting a message across if he 
was going to save himself. 

O NCE more, the forbidden 
thought assailed the 
fringe of his consciousness 
and he barely succeeded in 
driving it back into obscurity 
again. But how long could he 
keep it up ? 

He stood paralyzed beside 
the bed, afraid that even the 
slightest movement would 
somehow trip the trigger that 
was hidden so close to the sur- 
face of his thought stream. 

If he could only find some 
way of letting them know he 
was in danger! Naturally, he 
wouldn’t be able to say what 
the peril was. For he would 
have to bring it to the surface 
of his mind first. And that, in 
itself, would be fatal. 

But if they knew he was 
still in the teleportive phase, 
and if they saw the perspira- 
tion on his face and his ex- 
pression of horror, then they 
would certainly realize the 
immediate need for sedation. 

One simple sentence would 
do it. And he could pen that 
message without skirting too 
close to the forbidden thought. 
Cautiously, he made his way 



to the writing table. As 
though he were sitting on an 
explosive that might go otf 
with any one of his next move- 
ments, he gingerly wrote : 

I exposed myself for a six- 

day period! 

The door opened and he 
turned slowly to watch Kate 
Connerly enter. He waved the 
sheet of paper so that she 
might see it and come read 
what he had written. He 
would have shouted the mes- 
sage, but just then he was 
frantically fighting off an im- 
pulse to open his mind to the 
thought that would send him 
on his last impulsive leap. 

He tried to make a noise in 
his throat. But nothing came 
out. 

He stared terrified at the 
chair and the blanket that was 
draped across her other arm 
and he wanted to shout: Not 
that! Not that! 

But even thinking about the 
protest invited a return of the 
disastrous thought. 

She took a quick glance in 
his direction, not really seeing 
enough to sense that some- 
thing was wrong, and began 
' wrestling the chair again. 

And even before she said 
them, he knew that she would 
speak the fatal suggestive 
words : 

“It’s such a beautiful day 
outside. Dr. Sanderson. You’re 
going to go bask in the sun.”

Worlds of if 

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



T WO of the most complicat- 
ed brains recently applied 
to science fiction are to be 
found in the skulls of Robert 
A. W. Lowndes and James 
Blish. Blish in his own right 
has produced a dozen science 
fiction books, most good, some 
outstanding. If Lowndes has 
been less prolific, it is because 
he has spent the last twenty 
years editing science fiction 
(and other) magazines, thus 
putting most of his creative 
thought into other people’s 
stories. 

In their first collaboi'ation 
novel. The Duplicated Man 
(Avalon), these two have 
brewed such a mash of inven- 
tion and imagination as has 
not been seen since van Vogt. 
The distillate is raw, but it is 
dizzying and sometimes very 
sweet. We have every reason 
to believe that Blish-Lowndes 
wrote this novel with tongues 
in cheek; certainly at least a 
part of their intention was to 
caricature the smirking stick 
figures which so impossibly 
triumph in a typical van Vogt 
work (which are — has anyone 
noticed ? — the same soulless, 
pointless totems as populate 
the works of Ayn Rand). In 
this they succeeded. But they 

82 



did more. They produced a 
novel. 

Their central character is 
Paul Danton. He is the Dupli- 
cated Man. Blish and Lowndes 
describe him as a cardboard 
figure : he is a dedicated revo- 
lutionary but a totally ineffec- 
tive one; he hates the world 
state, but can find no better 
tactic to use against it than 
joining an underground con- 
spiracy which has yet to 
achieve its first success of any 
kind. This doesn’t matter. 
Blish-Lowndes need Danton 
only to serve as a canvas on 
whom they can paint half a 
dozen other characters, each 
part Danton and part someone 
else. The interplay of the sev- 
en duplicated Dantons is one 
of the great merits of the 
book. 

The action of the story con- 
cerns (among much else) a 
sort of planned cold war be- 
tween Earth and Venus, a war 
that is based on deception and 
sustained by fraud. The rul- 
ing bodies of each planet are 
all working at cross purposes, 
each individual councilor try- 
ing to achieve his own cryptic 
aims, both groups honey- 
combed with espionage and 
riddled with disloyalty. There 




is always an overt purpose 
(irrelevant) and a real pur- 
pose (concealed) for every 
act. When the interplanetary 
war finally hots up, it is wag- 
ed with nearly Nexialist strat- 
egy. Floods of nuclear missiles 
are mere diversions. The ulti- 
mate victorious stroke consists 
of rolling an empty barrel 
down a long flight of stairs. 

The Duplicated Man is 
a fantastically complicated 
book. In inept hands, it would 
be utterly tiresome. In the 
hands of Blish and Lowndes, 
it is — ^amazingly! — clear, logi- 
cal and gripping. It possesses 
cascades of inventive detail, 
big (the marvelous immortal, 
Geoffrey Thomas) and little 
(the characteristic smudged 
lips of the Venusians, caused 
by the folk belief that ball- 
point pens write better under 
water). It is a rewarding 
work. In the age of the Dis- 
posable Science Fiction Novel, 
designed like Kleenex to be 
used once and thrown away. 
The Duplicated Man is a story 
which improves with re-read- 
ing. Astonishing, but there it 
is. 

ARTHUR C. CLARKE has 
a sharp mind and a disci- 
plined typewriter and his 
stories of space exploration 
have that rare and satisfying 
quality, the feel of being the 
authentic reminiscences of an 
Old Space Dog. In The Chal- 
lenge of the Space Ship (Har- 
per), he is permitted to cast 



off the fiction format and pre- 
sent some two hundred pages 
of pure fact and speculation — 
why aliens haven’t come to 
Earth, and what a summer- 
resort satellite may be like; 
whether climate control is 
feasible, and how to travel be- 
tween the stars. 

What is good about these 
essays is very, very good. 
When he speaks of wartime 
radar and of “FIDO” (the 
R.A.F. fog-dispersal system 
used to get bombers safely 
down from the thick British 
skies), we all can afford to lis- 
ten. He was on the spot. He 
has had five sightings of 
UFOs himself; in explaining 
them, he explains away nearly 
all of the case the flying- 
saucerites have so laboriously 
built up. Where he writes of 
the probable shape of a sleep- 
ing compartment on a Mars- 
bound rocket, he is discussing 
a subject to which he has 
given much thought and a 
great deal of study. His guess 
is still only a guess, but it has 
become the informed guess of 
an expert. 

There are ten or twelve 
pieces as good as these in The 
Challenge of the Space Ship. 
Unfortunately there are also 
ten or twelve others. In “The 
Men on the Moon,” Clarke 
identifies for us several dozen 
historical figures after whom 
lunar craters have been 
named ; surely this is only tep- 
idly exciting to anyone. In 
“The Star of the Magi,” he 



83 




tries to explain the Star that 
led the wise men to Bethlehem 
and arrives at the conclusion 
that it was a supernova 
(which it surely was not. If 
the star-gazers of Egypt, 
China and India had somehow 
missed it, those of Rome 
would not. We know that one 
of Rome’s greatest astrolo- 
gers, Thrasyllus, was in Asia 
Minor at the time) . In “Ques- 
tion Time,” the subject for 
discussion is not science at all 
but that quite different topic, 
the problems of lecturing on 
science. The final piece in the 
book, “Of Space and the 
Spirit,” is a diffuse gather-all 
which touches on everything 
and covers nothing. 

These sections, and one or 
two others, are the dross in 
The Challenge of the Space 
Ship. They do not dim the lus- 
ter of the gold that appears 
elsewhere in the book, but 
they make one wish that the 
publisher had been a more se- 
lective miner. 

A MORE rewarding Clarke — 
and probably the biggest sci- 
ence fiction book of recent 
years — is his Across the Sea 
of Stars (Harcourt, Brace), 
which contains eighteen short 
stories and two complete nov- 
els, or rather more than the 
wordage of three ordinary 
books, in one binding and at 
one single price. This is a bar- 
gain. 

It is also a first-rate in- 
troduction to Clarke’s work, if 

84 



the reader who needs one hap- 
pens to exist. 

The novels are Earthlight 
(a peculiarly plausible inter- 
planetary war between Earth 
and its scatter of solar colo- 
nies) and Childhood’s End 
(concerning’ the supercession 
of the human race by its own 
evolved children). "The short 
stories do not include all of 
Clarke’s best— “The Nine Bil- 
lion Names of God” is miss- 
ing, and so is “The Star” — but 
they show his ways and moods. 
Arthur Clarke finds it irritat- 
ing to be told that “Rescue 
Party” is his best story be- 
cause it was his very first. 
Therefore that fact will not 
be commented upon at this 
time, but it is here, and it is 
a magnificent yarn, and there 
are many others very nearly 
as good. 

DAMON KNIGHT possesses 
wit and invention, and dis- 
plays both in Masters of Evo- 
lution, as his book publishers 
(Ace) have retitled his old 
Galaxy novella. City folk and 
country folk hate each other 
and no longer have any peace- 
able contact with each other. 
So as not to confuse the read- 
er with on-the-other-hands, 
Knight has made it a premise 
that there is nothing useful, 
good or desirable about any 
machine — any machine — and 
the only satisfactory way of 
life for humanity is biological. 

To document it, Knight 
has invented some splendidly 




evolved plants and animals — 
parrot sort of things for stor- 
ing data and transmitting 
messages, ferriferous bushes 
whose fruits are Bowie knives, 
etc. The merely technological 
cities get the worst of it, but 
Knight convinces you that to 
put them out of their misery is 
entirely a kindnes, as he de- 
scribes the crushing load of 
absolutely essential labor-sav- 
ing devices that each city 
dweller must drag about. This 
one is fun. 

THE OTHER half of the dou- 
ble volume is Fire in the Heav- 
ens, in which George 0. Smith 
rids nuclear physics of that 
pesky little problem, the neu- 
trino. There isn’t any neu- 
trino, Smith says. What made 
physicists think there was 
such a thing is the previously 
undiscovered fact that every 
time ener^ is expended, a lit- 
tle bit of it drains off to make 
trouble in the Sun. That is 
how stars go nova, and that’s 
what our heroes have to pre- 
vent in Fire in the Heavens. 

Smith has written a lot of 
science fiction stories very like 
this one. As he is an engineer 
by profession, his gadgets 
give the enjoyable illusion of 
working, which is a plus. Still, 
because he concentrates on 
the gadgetry to the exclusion 
of the development of the 
characters, this is a very se- 
rious minus. Not only by 
gadgetry but by cocktail-hour 
dialogue and by action, the 



reader is entertained, but he 
is almost never made to feel. 

What’s wrong with that? 
Why, nothing much, but it is 
a surprise all the same to find 
that after two decades George 
0. Smith can surprise us with 
as warm and moving a story 
as another new book under his 
byline. The Fourth R (Ballan- 
tine) . 

In The Fourth R, Smith 
turns his back on gum-chew- 
ing electronic technicians and 
dauntless space voyages. His 
hero is a boy, Jimmy Holden. 
Jimmy was conceived and 
brought to birth because his 
parents, both scientists, need- 
ed a child for their researches 
into mechanical education. 
Their researches succeeded, 
but the parents died abruptly, 
leaving young Jimmy, six 
years old, with an adult edu- 
cation but a child’s brain, a 
world of knowledge but a 
body just four feet tall. 
Worse, Jimmy is utterly alone. 
He dares confide in no one, 
and he dares not stay with his 
guardian — whose interest in 
the mechanical educator was 
extreme, and dangerous. 

Smith has written Jimmy’s 
story with inventiveness and 
thought, and, above all, with 
sympathetic understanding of 
young Jimmy Holden. It is a 
splendid job. The person who 
doesn’t much like science fic- 
tion will enjoy this book, and 
so will the person who does. 

Prolific Smith has still an- 
other book for us this month 



85 




— and still another publisher. 
Path of Unreason comes out 
under the Gnome Press im- 
print, James Forrest Carroll, 
Smith’s bero, is either a cata- 
tonic suffering from overwork 
and deep-seated psychic flaws, 
or the victim of a plot on the 
part of alien invaders of 
Earth. Either premise might 
make a useful and entertain- 
ing book, but as Smith has 
meticulously refused to dis- 
tinguish between the lady and 
the tiger for 185 pages, and 
thumbs his nose at our igno- 
rance in an epilogue, the effect 
is more mystifying than 
amusing. 

ADAM CHASE’S The Golden 
Ape (Avalon) concerns a pe- 
culiar young giant who com- 
mutes between worlds, fight- 
ing duels like a very John Car- 
ter and rescuing a girl very 
like Dejah Thoris from quite 
Barsoomian perils. It has a 
great deal of action and color, 
but it also has a great deal of 
tripe. Hank Searls’s first 
novel. The Big X (Harper) , is 
a first-rate, fast-moving, tech- 
nically reliable story of a test 
pilot flying the last-but-one 
ancestor of the spaceship. The 
Big X is science fiction, but 
only just; in another year or 
so, it will be history. Yet it 
contains more of the challenge 
of the unknown than any 
dozen routine intergalactic 
blood-baths. 

In The Stars Are Too High 
(Random House), Agnew H. 

86 



Bahnson, Jr., proposes a se- 
cretly built spaceship which 
its inventors use to pretend 
the Earth is being explored by 
aliens, so as to unite mankind 
and end war. This theme has 
been so well explored by oth- 
ers, principally Theodore 
Sturgeon, that only great skill 
and inventive detail could jus- 
tify another handling. These 
elements do not occur in The 
Stars Are Too High. It is an 
inferior book; what’s worse, 
its publishers have claimed for 
it the status of a classic, which 
is disgraceful. 

Bombs in Orbit, by Jeff 
Sutton, is an Ace original 
concerning a Russian hydro- 
gen-bomb satellite project and 
an American rocket pilot’s 
fight to nullify it. Sometimes 
the reasoning is thin, but most 
of the detail is excellent, the 
suspense is lushly troweled on 
and the pace never lets up. 

Murray Leinster quietly 
goes on and on writing first- 
rate science fiction stories, as 
he has done since 1926. (If he 
did not appear in a science 
fiction magazine befoi’e that 
year, it is only because there 
was no science fiction maga- 
zine to appear in.) Apparently 
he will go on forever. This is 
an attractive prospect. In 
Monsters and Such (Avon) , 
an unprepossessing title has 
been given to a fine collection 
of his more recent stories. 
Only “Proxima Centuari” 
(1935) goes back more than a 
decade, but it is well worth 




reviving; and all the others in 
the book are worth keeping 
alive indefinitely. 

Jerry Sohl has two novels 
for us at once. The first is a 
reprint of his Rinehart novel, 
The Transcendent Man (Ban- 
tam) , which lets us in on the 
well-kept secret of Man’s rap- 
id evolutionary rise. Capel- 
lans are behind it. They drive 
us upward, for they live on 
our brain power ; unfortunate- 
ly, they are about to leave us 
and we will then rapidly re- 
vert to the animal. Sohl’s hero 
must decide what to do about 
all this. 

In One Against Herculum 
(Ace), Sohl invents for us a 
future city-colony in which 
crime and violence are kept 
under control by licensing the 
privilege of criminal activity. 
The idea has its merits, but 
Sohl has made almost no use 
of it, preferring to drop that 
notion and get on with another 
underground revolt against a 
dictatorial state, and so the 
story quickly confines itself 
to routine shoot-and-be-shot. 
This is a double volume, of 
which the flip side is Secret 
of the Lost Race, by Andre 
Norton, a competent time- 
killer concerning evil exploit- 
ers of a frontier planet. Our 
hero (who, you will hardly 
fail to guess, turns out to be 
one of the Lost Race himself) 
sets everything straight in a 
few knockdown brawls. 

Miss Norton also offers 
The Beast Master (Harcourt, 



Brace), which gives us a de- 
molished Earth and a dis- 
persed handful of humans 
scattered among the non-hu- 
man civilized planets of the 
Galaxy. Her hero is a Navajo 
who, in the war that destroy- 
ed Earth, was a commando 
leader of a squad of animals 
trained to help wage war. 

In Seed of Light (Ballan- 
tine), Edmund Cooper spans 
many centuries and many 
light-years and yet manages 
to maintain a continuity of 
narrative while, generation 
after generation, his charac- 
ters are born, grow and die. 
Earth is self-destroyed ; only 
ten humans survive, in a 
rocket headed for a hoped-for 
planet of Alpha Centauri. But 
Alpha Centauri is barren ; the 
ship wheels around it and 
heads for Sirius. If there is 
no planet circling Sirius, they 
will try Procyon; if not Pro- 
cyon, then Vega . then Al- 
tair . The handful of men, 
women and babies in the ship 
are all of humanity, and they 
will not let themselves be de- 
stroyed. 

Talbot Mundy’s celebrated 
series concerning the adven- 
tures of Prince Tros aren’t 
really science fiction, but they 
are fun. In Tros of Samo- 
thrace (Fantasy Classic Li- 
brary), the prince battles 
Norsemen, pre-Roman Brit- 
ons and Julius Caesar. In 
Purple Pirate, he tackles Cleo- 
patra in intrigue, her sister 
in love, and Mark Antony in 

87 




battle. Tros is always exciting. 
What’s more, Mundy always 
does his homework — if his 
historical facts are sometimes 
false, it is because of license, 
not ignorance. 

Robot Hunt (Avalon), by 
Roger Lee Vernon, opens into 
the middle of a complicated 
and pulse-stirring spy hunt in 
a future Paris. It is pure Key- 
stone Kops chase, but it suc- 
ceeds in catching the interest 
at once and the pace is sus- 
tained to the very end. Vernon 
conceives an Earth in which 
each sovereign nation has its 
shield of impenetrable force 
screens, thus neutralizing all 
weapons and ending war for- 
ever — until someone discov- 
ers a way through the screens. 
Then, of course, the whole 
bloody fuss starts all over 
again. Robot Hunt is compos- 
ed of ingredients which have 
produced dozens of the worst 
literary clinkers of our times, 
but Vernon stirs in thought. 

In Starman’s Quest 
(Gnome), Robert Silverberg 
proposes to entertain the teen- 
age audience with a story 
about a 300-year-old hero 
coeval with his readers. (He 
has spent most of his life in 
near-light-speed space travel. 
Under relativity law, his ob- 
jective-time age is only seven- 
teen.) Silverberg no sooner 
settles on this theme than he 
abandons it in favor of a 
travelogue on an implausible 
future Earth, populated by 
unlikely nuts. 



Gnome also gives us The 
Dawning Light by Robert 
Randall, a sequel to The 
Shrouded Planet. There are 
strange sights and events, but 
you must not linger to exam- 
ine them, for the skin of solid 
plot and thought that sustains 
the story is only millimeters 
thick, and if you pause to re- 
flect, you will plunge through 
the crust. 

For the younger ones, Clif- 
ford B. Hicks’s First Boy on 
the Moon (Winston) under- 
takes to initiate children from 
eight to ten into the excite- 
ment of interplanetary travel. 
A boy named Mike and a boy 
named Mud stow away on a 
rocket piloted by Mike’s dad- 
dy; and, winked at by an 
utterly incredible space-sta- 
tion commander, are allowed 
to participate in the first 
lunar landing. Being very 
young, they may not be very 
critical, so the worn and rudi- 
mentary plot may get by. 

Readers who wish to con- 
trast practice with theory in 
the case of the undersigned 
may wish to avail themselves 
of two new Ballantine titles: 
Wolf bane (a novel, in collab- 
oration with the late C. M. 
Kornbluth) and Tomorrow 
Times Seven (a collection of 
short stories) . In a field where 
a reviewer is a writer is an 
editor is a fan, the author con- 
siders himself mighty bi-ave 
in speaking so forthrightly of 
the work of his colleagues.

To Each His Own 

By JACK SHARKEY 



A world ideal for life will have life on it — 



but don’t expect ideal life! 



O N SEPTEMBER the 24th, 
1965, the Venusian space- 
ship Investigator floated gent- 
ly to Earth in Times Square. 

The sleek metal belly of the 
ship touched feather-light up- 
on the asphalt “X” of Broad- 
way and Seventh Avenue, and 
stubby stabilizing legs extend- 
ed from ports along the sides 
of the hull, bracing the ship’s 
mass against dangerous roll- 
ing, leaving it hulking there 
like some metallic beetle at 
rest. 

The sun was almost directly 
overhead, sending yellow-gold 
serpentine glints wriggling on 
the gleaming surface of the 
ship. After the ve^ slight 
thumping as the ship settled 
into place, there was no sound 
throughout the nearby streets 
of New York. 

Absent was the noise of 
traffic, the hubbub of voices. 



the hurry-scurry of pedes- 
trians. Nothing but heavy op- 
pressive silence everywhere 
outside the body of the ship. 
No apprehensive eye appear^ 
at a window to stare at the 
visitor from the nearest plan- 
et. No telephone was picked up 
in nervous haste to warn the 
authorities of the possible 
menace to the peoples of 
Earth. Just the silence and the 
dancing sunlight. 

Inside the spaceship, there 
was swift, practiced activity. 

The Venusians were a pick- 
ed, trained crew. This, the 
first contact with the third 
planet, called for quick reac- 
tion, accurate evaluation, and 
competent decision. 

Each of the five aboard had 
a job to do immediately upon 
landing. With no conversation, 
they were all at their tasks. It 
was an operation they’d prac- 

89 




ticed many times over, back at 
their home base on Venus. 
They were sick of the thing 
even before being sent to 
Earth. But their training had 
paid well, for now their mo- 
tions were automatic, each 
separate action swift, sure and 
precise. 

Gwann, the pilot, his heavy- 
lidded eyes narrowed with the 
intensity of concentration, 
checked and re-checked his in- 
struments and gauges. His 
nimble three-digited hands, 
with their long, flat palms, 
flickered from button to 
switch to dial. He locked the 
stabilizing legs into position, 
once each leg had made its 
contact securely with the sur- 
face outside. He dampered the 
power of the interplanetary 
drive, leaving its deadly ema- 
nations at a low, and therefore 
safe, degree of pulsation. He 
checked the release valves of 
the individual skimmers, mak- 
ing certain at the same time 
that, should the atmosphere 
outside be hostile to Venusian 
breathing, the tanks were fill- 
ed and the cockpit seals were 
tight and break-free. 

D ROG, the navigator, used 
compass, ruler and stylus 
upon the scant, almost rudi- 
mentary Earth map, to deter- 
mine the exact point of contact 
with the third planet. Venu- 
sian telescopes were able to 
see — very indistinctly — conti- 
nental outlines at the twenty- 
million-mile distance to their 

90 



neighbor planet. But the foggy 
overhang that shrouded their 
home planet had made sharp 
topographical drawing well- 
nigh impossible. 

Volval, as Drog passed him 
the information, relayed the 
findings by light-beam back to 
their home base. The geo- 
graphical location, coded into 
the tight beam, sped outward 
from the surface of Earth to- 
ward Venus, where it would 
not be received for at least a 
minute and a half. Volval, hav- 
ing transmitted the data, 
waited impatiently while the 
Venusian biochemist tested 
the outside surface against 
their leaving the ship. 

Jorik, the biochemist, re- 
volved the small metal “cage” 
with its quivering, burbling 
Venusian life-forms on it back 
into the space over his work- 
table. The animals seemed un- 
harmed by their exposure to 
the alien planet, but he began 
more definitive tests upon the 
samplings of atmosphere and 
soil and vegetation brought 
back by a tiny robo-skimmer 
that had searched throughout 
a three-mile radius of the ship 
immediately after the landing, 
and had returned by homing 
beam to its tiny access port 
in the thick metal side of the 
ship. 

While Volval waited in in- 
creasing irritation, and Jorik 
ran his tests, Klendro, the 
most expendable member of 
the expedition, studied his 
speech over and over, his 

JACK SHARKEY 




three-valved heart squirting 
its watery blood through his 
tiny, hairlike arteries and 
veins. 

Klendro was almost a so- 
cial outcast with these oth- 
ers, these real spacemen, 
though his job, he felt, was the 
most important. Klendro was 
the Venusian ambassador to 
the governments of Earth. He 
went over his speech again, 
hoping that the Earth broad- 
casts picked up now and then 
on Venus had been accurate 
enough for the Venusian lin- 
guists to write him a speech 
that wouldn’t embarrass the 
Earth people by its inane mis- 
uses of their tongue. 

Broadcasts had indicated 
that the major powers on 
Earth were the United States 
— whatever those were — of 
America and Soviet Russia. 
The Russian broadcasts, how- 
ever, being nothing more than 
a series of eulogies declaring 
the happiness of life in Russia, 
had been too lacking in 
breadth to give the linguists 
much to work on. They had 
therefore chosen English as 
the tongue in which Klendro 
was to make his speech. 

He lifted the scroll once 
more and began reading his 
speech half aloud, having a 
bit of trouble, as usual, in con- 
trolling the square-tipped sur- 
face of his tongue in forming 
the unfamiliar syllables. 

“Pipple of Arth,” he said, 
slowly and with much effort, 
“it is with grett plazzer that 

TO EACH HIS OWN 



we mek this, tha farst contact 
with arr nebber planet. We 
are from tha second planet 
from yer — or mebbe Uh shudd 
seh arr — sun. Tha planet you 
knaw as Venus. We feel that 
we can share with arr nebber 
planet the fronts of arr — of 
arr — ” Klendro braced him- 
self, then forced out awkward- 
ly, “moot-yoo-ull sa-yan-tific 
ri-sarch . .” 

He refolded the long coil of 
the scroll and stuffed it into 
his belt-sack. Well, he told 
himself, for better or worse. 
I’ve got to give this speech. 
He wished he were anywhere 
but here. 

S OME of the broadcasts had 
indicated a certain bellig- 
erency in the inhabitants of 
this alien planet. He wondered, 
with a kind of sick fright, if 
he would ever have the oppor- 
tunity to deliver the speech, 
even badly. Some of the more 
esoteric phrasings of the 
Earth broadcasts had eluded 
the interpretations of the Ve- 
nusian linguists. One of the 
more recurrent phrases was a 
“slug in the guts.” They were 
not sure exactly what this en- 
tailed, but, from the context, 
the linguists were certain that 
it was something dire, possibly 
fatal. 

Klendro was a very unhap- 
py Venusian. 

“Volval!” Klendro heard 
Drog cry out. “Did you send 
that stuff?” 

“Yes,” the light-beam oper- 

91 




ator called back. “I’m waiting 
an Jorik now.” 

“All set here,” called Jorik, 
coming into Volval’s compart- 
ment, followed by Gwann. 
“The atmosphere is breath- 
able. A little heavy on the oxy- 
gen and light on the carbon 
dioxide, but that was expected 
before we took off. If we take 
deep inhales and periodic radi- 
ation, we should be all right.” 
“Fine,” said Gwann, the 
pilot and leader, as Klendro 
came into the room with the 
others. “Better keep your guns 
loose in their holsters, though. 
You know what they’ve told us 
about the Earthmen.” 

“Hot-headed.” Volval nod- 
ded. 

“Will we take the skim- 
mers?” asked Jorik. “Or do 
you think the Earthmen would 
prefer being met without the 
barrier-screens around us ?” 
"They’d prefer it, all right !” 
said Drog. “However, in my 
opinion — ” 

“We’re going to have to 
chance it sooner or later with- 
out the screens,” said Gwann. 
“The batteries in the skim- 
mers won’t last forever. We 
might as well go out there as 
we are.” 

“Who goes first?” asked 
Jorik. 

“Well,” Gwann shrugged, 
“if the crowds look hostile, I 
should go, as your leader. If 
they seem merely curious, 
then it’s up to Klendro, as our 
ambassador, to make his 
speech.” 



Jorik frowned. “Now, wait, 
Gwann. Perhaps I ought to tell 
you. The sight records on the 
robo-skimmer showed no evi- 
dence of Earthmen outside the 
ship.” 

“That’s ridiculous,” said 
Gwann, his eyes flashing. “Ve- 
nus reports this city is one of 
the most populous.” 

Jorik smiled wryly. “Then 
the populace certainly ducked 
out of sight quickly when they 
saw the robo-skimmer com- 
ing.” 

Gwann seemed on the point 
of making a sharp retort, and 
instead turned away toward 
the exit lock. “Since things 
seem suspicious. I’d best go 
first.” 

“Sir,” said Volval, laying a 
hand upon his leader’s arm. 

“Yes?” queried Gwann, 
pausing. 

“Good luck, sir,” Volval fal- 
tered, drawing his hand back. 

“Thanks,” said Gwann, not 
unkindly. “For Venus,” he 
added. 

“For Venus,” the others 
echoed. 

Gwann released the safety 
lock on the circular metal door 
and turned the valve handle. 
Slowly, the door recessed itself 
in the metal pocket in the 
ship’s wall, and Gwann went 
out into the yellow glow of the 
sunlight glittering in Times 
Square. 

T he sun was glowing crim- 
son on the horizon when 
the five Venusians met once 



92

more at the door of their ship. 

“Nothing — no clue, no peo- 
ple,” said Jorik, his face wrin- 
kled with puzzlement. “I can’t 
understand it.” 

“Perhaps some holo- 
caust . ?” Volval began 
weakly. 

“Or a war?” Drog hinted 
gravely. 

“Impossible!” said Gwann, 
leaning against one of the legs 
of the gigantic ship. “There 
is a conspicuous absence of 
anything that might be con- 
strued as a weapon of war. 
There are no bodies in the 
buildings or in the streets. No 
wreckage anywhere.” 

“Perhaps they have been 
frightened by our appearance 
and have gone into hiding?” 
asked Klendro, fingering the 
edge of his now futile scroll 
where it protruded from his 
belt-sack. 

“Nonsense,” said their lead- 
er. “From all we’ve learned of 
the Earthmen, fright would 
only make them aggressive. 
They would not have hidden 
from us ; they’d have tried to 
shoot us down when we 
emerged from the ship.” 

“There was one thing . .” 
said Jorik slowly. “I almost 
did not see it, but its shadow 
passed close by me on the side 
of one of the buildings, and I 
looked up barely in time to get 
a glimpse of it before it van- 
ished.” 

“What was it like?” asked 
Gwann quickly. 

“Some sort of animal, prob- 



ably carnivorous,” said Jorik. 
“I cannot be certain, of course, 
but 1 saw a mouth with teeth 
bespeaking flesh-eating. Quite 
a — ” he repressed a shudder — 
“quite a large mouth.” 

“Strange,” said Gwann. 
“Exceedingly strange. You 
saw only the one?” 

Jorik nodded. 

“Well,” said Gwann, “one 
carnivore cannot have ac- 
counted for a population that 
runs into the millions. Besides, 
the Earthmen would be able to 
deal with mere animal life.” 

K lendro remembered the 
“slug in the guts” and 
blanched. 

“What should we do, sir?” 
asked Volval. “Our orders 
were to make peaceful contact 
with the Earthmen. If there 
are no Earthmen — ?” 

“Calm yourself, Volval.” 
Gwann smiled, patting the 
younger man upon the shoul- 
der. *‘If there are Earthmen 
to contact, we’ll make that 
contact. I have an idea.” 
“What, sir?” asked Drog. 
“We shall each take one of 
the skimmers and investigate 
the surface of the planet. Now, 
while our maps are incom- 
plete, I feel that Drog can 
draw us up competent enough 
maps to guide us over the sur- 
face of Earth.” 

“I can try, sir,” said Drog. 
“We’ll meet back here at the 
ship in five days,” said Gwann. 
“All of you take along enough 
supplies for five days, plus an 

93 



TO EACH HIS OWN 




extra day’s rations in case of 
emergency. The homing beam 
on our ship will bring you 
safely back if you get lost.” 
'‘One thing, sir,” said Jorik, 
his brow creased in a frown. 
"We’d best all take along extra 
ammunition for the guns.” 
"The carnivores?” 

The biochemist nodded. 
"Where there’s one, there are 
bound to be others. That one 
I saw was large enough to bite 
a chunk out of a skimmer.” 
Klendro, pale already, lost 
more color. 

E ach was assigned a conti- 
nent to check. Of the two 
extra continents, Drog took 
one, and Gwann the other, the 
consensus being that the pilot 
and navigator could better cov- 
er extra territory than the 
others, who were less used to 
piloting the sleek skimmers. 

Volval was to go to the 
Europe - Asia land mass, 
Gwann to Africa and Antarc- 
tica, Klendro to Australia, 
Jorik to South America, and 
Drog to Arctica, after first 
checking over the North 
American Continent on which 
they had landed. 

"Something exceedingly 
strange,” said Jorik, before 
they separated, "about the 
consolidation of their civiliza- 
tion. So much wasted land 
area.” 

"The sooner I get back to 
Venus, the happier I’ll be,” 
said Gwann, keeping his voice 
down so that only Jorik, the 

94 



biochemist, could hear him, 
"This place is eerie. It’s — it’s 
like a ghost planet.” 

"And there’s something 
wrong about the buildings. 
They are abominably ineffi- 
cient. I can barely conceive the 
uses of some of the artifacts.” 
"Maybe,” said Gwann sud- 
denly, "we never will know!” 
"Sir,” said Volval, ap- 
proaching the pilot, "I’ve dis- 
covered some maps.” He held 
out a packet of papers, tinted 
blue and brown. 

"Good work, Volval,” said 
Gwann, taking the packet. 
"Where did you find them?” 
"In one of those small shops, 
not far from the ship, sir. I 
cannot read the designations, 
of course, but I thought that, 
by a comparison with the 
maps from Venus Observa- 
tory, we might — ” 

"That’s intelligent think- 
ing,” said Gwann, nodding. 
"Their maps are bound to be 
similar to ours. Klendro! 
What can you make of these?” 
The ambassador came over 
and took the thick packet. The 
paper of the maps, as he did 
so, tore apart, and bits and 
pieces of the soft, pulpy edges 
dropped in a shower to the 
street. 

"Not very substantial mate- 
rial, is it?” he muttered, un- 
folding the topmost of the 
maps. He looked over the col- 
ored line drawings on the page 
in some bewilderment. The let- 
ters spelling out "Rand Mc- 
Nally” meant nothing to his 

JACK SHARKEY 




alien eyes. The map itself was 
a mercator projection of the 
globe, the extreme northern 
and southern continents being 
somewhat distorted. After a 
few moments, he shook his 
head. 

“I’m sorry. All the Earth 
broadcasts that we intercepted 
gave me a working knowledge 
of the spoken word, sir, but 
I’m afraid their actual word 
symbols are beyond me. It 
would take trained linguists 
months, perhaps years, to get 
a correlation between the 
sound of the word and its writ- 
ten image.” 

“Drog?” said Gwann, turn- 
ing to the navigator. 

Drog took the rotting sheet 
in his hands and studied the 
configurations of the conti- 
nents. After a bit, he bright- 
ened. 

“Sir, I think I can figure 
this out. According to our 
landing calculations, we are 
here.” He jabbed a digit at 
one section of the page, and 
was distressed when it went 
right through. “The material 
seems to be falling apart, sir.” 

“Perhaps,” Jorik suggested, 
“it is undergoing some unnat- 
ural stress — possibly tied up 
somehow with whatever it was 
that depopulated this city?” 

“A good point, Jorik,” said 
Gwann. 

A long black shadow slid 
across the pavement near 
their feet and the five Venu- 
sians, very much startled, look- 



ed overhead. They were barely 
in time to see the huge gray 
form of the carnivore before 
it vanished behind a sign atop 
a nearby building which bore 
the mystifying information 
“Pepsi-Cola.” 

“There, sir!” cried Jorik. 
“That’s exactly like the one I 
saw earlier!” 

“Those teetkl” Klendro 
whimpered. “They could bite 
one of us in two!” 

“And what they could do to 
us, they could do to an Earth- 
man,” Gwann said specula- 
tively. “From the sizes of the 
doorways in these buildings, 
and the clothing on display in 
the shop windows, the Earth- 
men could not have been much 
larger than us.” 

“Sir,” said Drog, holding up 
the map so that the leader 
could see it, “look here. This 
blue section that runs all over 
the map. You see, it’s marked 
circle-arc-fork-cone-zigzag.” 
“Yes,” said Gwann. “I see. 
What about it?” 

“Well, sir, it recurs on the 
map, but each time it has a 
new group of symbols in front 
of it. What can it mean?” 
Gwann frowned and studied 
the five symbols : 0-C-E-A-N. 

“Seems to suggest a similar- 
ity between all of them,” said 
Jorik. “Perhaps the first syro- 
bol only means that the section 
is in a different place.” 

All five Venusians studied 
A-R-C-T-I-C, A-N-T-A-R-C- 
T-I-C, I-N-D-I-A-N, and the 
other symbols that were used 

95 



TO EACH HIS OWN 




in conjunction with the mys- 
terious 0-C-E-A-N. 

''A tribal tabu!” exclaimed 
Jorik. 

‘'What are you talking 
about, Jorik?” said Gwann 
impatiently. 

“You recall I said there 
seemed something strange 
about the consolidation of the 
populace in certain areas ? The 
wasted land space?” 

“Yes, yes. What about it?” 

“All these sections marked 
0-C-E-A-N are the unused 
areas. There must have been 
some sort of tribal superstition 
about dwelling in those areas. 
That would explain why all 
the people lived on the higher 
ground here.” 

“I — I would have expected 
to find something blue in that 
area,” said Gwann uncertain- 
ly. “Or else why is it so mark- 
ed?” 

“Sir,” said Jorik respectful- 
ly, “some sections are colored 
very oddly — even in red. Yet 
no such colors were found any- 
where on the planet by our 
telescopes, were they? And 
none of these large blue areas 
shows population centers. 
Tabu areas, obviously — not to 
be inhabited.” 

Gwann shivered. “The long- 
er I stay here, the less I like 
it. Come on. Each of you take 
one of these maps. Drog, you 
assign us to a specific sector 
by these maps, rather than by 
ours. We'll meet back here at 
the ship in five days.” 

One by one, the Venusians 



got aboard their skimmers, 
making sure the protective 
barriers were working, and 
then glided off to investigate 
the ghost planet. 

D rog, sliding in his trim 
craft over the Noiih 
American continent, stopped 
many times, at each large city 
he discovered, but the story 
was the same as in New York. 
Empty buildings, no particu- 
lar damages except what could 
be accounted for by decay and 
long disuse. Every so often — 
more often than he enjoyed — 
a flock of the huge carnivores 
soared above his skimmer, 
their long, dark shadows slith- 
ering over the cockpit in the 
dancing yellow sunlight. 

Once, one of them broke 
away from the group and 
spiraled down to investigate 
his craft. Drog jabbed the but- 
ton of the nose-gun hastily, 
and a lance of metal sped with 
a flicker of light into the thick 
hide of the oncoming monster. 

A thick spray of blood gush- 
ed from the wound, as the 
great beast writhed in torment 
before sliding down through 
the atmosphere toward the 
distant ground. Its blood hung 
in a grisly trail over it as it 
plunged, marking its passage, 
then began to fall slowly after 
the beast. 

Drog was by now almost a 
mile beyond the point where 
he had fired at the carnivore, 
but he wasn't too far away to 
see its hungry companions 



96 



JACK SHARKEY 




swoop down after it and begin 
rending it even before it 
reached the ground. 

He shuddered and looked 
away. 

As he soared onward, he de- 
termined to keep the barrier 
on all night long, while he 
slept. If he could sleep . 

North America taken care 
of, as well as possible in his 
limited time, Drog headed 
northward for the continent of 
Arctica. 

Nothing but bare land and 
ocean bottom met his eye. 

Feeling increasingly queasy, 
he nosed the skimmer around 
and set it swishing back to- 
ward New York. 

J ORIK watched the shadow 
of his skimmer pacing his 
own motion over the tops of 
the tangled jungle trees below. 
He inclined the nose of the 
craft downward, and began a 
shallow glide toward a clear- 
ing in the midst of the dense 
undergrowth. 

Braking the skimmer gent- 
ly, he let it settle slowly into 
the resilient grip of the tall 
yellow-brown grass in the 
clearing. Making sure his gun 
was loaded and the safety 
catch off, he slid open the 
cockpit and eased himself out. 

He was — though of course 
he didn’t know it — deep in the 
Matto Grosso of South Amer- 
ica. Everywhere he looked, 
violent flares of color peeped 
at him through the twisted, 
swaying vines that clung 

TO EACH HIS OWN 



everjwhere. Nature had run 
riot in the jungle. No subtle- 
ties of shading or form here. 
Long, sharp leaves gleamed 
greenly on all sides of the bio- 
chemist. Radiant reds glowed 
from the shadowy depths of 
forest beyond the small clear- 
ing. Golden streamers hung in 
profusion from each crooked 
elbow of the chaotically twist- 
ed tree branches all about him. 

Despite the brilliance and 
beauty of it, Jorik sensed a 
hidden menace in the place. 
He should, at that spot, have 
been hearing shrieking, roar- 
ing, bleating, grunting of ani- 
mals, the cries of birds and 
skittering of insects. There 
was nothing but that all- 
pervading silence. 

Jorik moved slowly away 
from the skimmer and a^ 
proached the nearest tree, his 
scientist’s eye pondering some- 
thing not-quite-right-looking 
about it. As he got to it, and 
touched it, the thick, corru- 
gated bark fell into powder 
between his fingers. He press- 
ed, pried, thumped and tugged 
at the tree. It was dead. Dead 
and rotting. 

His heart fluttered annoy- 
ingly in his breast. There was 
something frightening about 
the way things were going. He 
could understand a war de- 
stroying human life, even civi- 
lization, but this — this was 
primeval territory. The beasts, 
the plants, the lower forms of 
life — ^these should have sur- 
vived. 



97 




But they hadn’t. 

Suddenly afraid, he rushed 
back to his skinuner, slid into 
the cockpit and took off, rising 
at a swift vertical angle from 
the dead jungle. 

Toward the eastern coast of 
South America, he saw many 
fine hotels, with magnificent 
curves of beaches following 
the perimeter of the land mass 
on which the people had lived 
— already he was thinking of 
them in the past tense — and 
Jorik wondered at the absence 
of the blue 0-C-E-A-N that 
should have bordered those 
beaches. 

But as he glided outward 
from the coast, curving steadi- 
ly northward toward New 
York, he saw that the beaches, 
with their pale silver sands, 
extended outward and down- 
ward toward only more land, 
soon becoming rocky, then 
turning at last into mud and 
ooze, with a sprinkling of 
blackish-green weeds. But no 
visible trace of the mysterious 
0-C-E-A-N. 

G WANN, searching through- 
out Africa, fared no bet- 
ter. Only the silence, the 
rotting vegetation, and the 
absence of landlocked life. 
Higher in the atmosphere of 
the ghost planet, he saw many 
of the carnivores, but also 
smaller animals, soaring in 
gloriously colored groups, and 
seemingly haiTnless. There 
were times when he had to 
pass through literal clouds of 



these smaller beasts, whizzing 
and bobbing and gliding past 
him by the millions, only to 
vanish in the hazy distance 
with a blaze of color. 

Africa having proven fruit- 
less, Gwann directed the skim- 
mer toward the opposite polar 
region from that which Drog 
was to investigate. 

Like Drog, he found only 
land there, and no continent. 
The land was ocean bottom. 
He consulted his map, but 
there was nothing below his 
skimmer that corresponded 
with the cryptic mark- 
ings: A-N-T-A-R-C-T-I-C 

0-C-E-A-N. 

He turned his skimmer 
around and started back for 
New York. 

VOLVAL, CRUISING from 
the Alps to the steppes and 
back again, found nothing to 
explain the disappearance of 
the Earthmen. Many cities, 
many lands, hamlets and vil- 
lages, huts and palaces ... It 
was the same every place. Si- 
lence. Fleeting glimpses of the 
carnivores and sometimes 
tinier-but-similar beasts. But 
no Earthmen. 

KLENDRO HAD passed over 
the surface of Australia fifty 
times in his five alloted days 
without discovering life of any 
sort other than the carnivores. 
And they, for some reason, 
were unusually well represent- 
ed in that region. They had 
come at his skimmer in grin- 



98 



JACK SHARKEY 




ning swanns, but the barrier 
held firm, and the unlucky 
nearer ones spun away with 
scorched flesh glowing red, to 
be tom to pieces by their com- 
panions. 

When he decided further in- 
vestigation was useless, Klen- 
dro was very glad to leave 
that place. A group of the 
carnivores gave chase, but 
Klendro spun his ship about 
long enough to shoot metal 
darts into two of them. As the 
others swerved back to begin 
an impromptu feast on their 
wounded companions, Klendro 
turned the skimmer up to full 
speed and made quick connec- 
tion with the homing device 
on the ship, back in New York. 

“I DON’T understand it,” said 
Gwann, on the night of the 
fifth day. The Venusians were 
all back in the ship in Times 
Square, having a meal to- 
gether that was partly to sat- 
isfy their appetites, partly to 
celebrate being together again 
with their friends. 

“It’s incredible, all right,” 
said Jorik. “A whole planet — 
and of a high degree of civili- 
zation, too — wiped out. The 
very vegetation dying. And 
that’s the frightening part of 
it; Not dead, mind you, dying. 
That means that whatever 
happened here happened re- 
cently.” 

“And those constructions in 
the buildings,” said Volval, 
staring bemusedly at the wall, 
“the ones marked S-t-a-i-r- 



w-a-y. I wonder what they 
were for.” 

“Obviously they were deco- 
rations added by the archi- 
tect,” said Drog. “Any fool 
can see they served no pur- 
pose. If anything, they hinder- 
ed the use of the access slots 
to the various levels of the 
buildings.” 

“Well,” said Gwann, “our 
work here is through. We’d 
better be heading back to 
Venus.” 

“And your report?” asked 
Jorik. 

“Positive,” said Gwann. 
"Favorable for immediate pos- 
session and colonization.” 

“It’s a good little planet.” 
Jorik nodded. “But why do 
you suppose the Earthmen all 
vanished ?” 

“We’ll probably never 
know,” Volval sighed. 

“Not unless,” said Klendro, 
indicating a bale of salvaged 
Earth materials, “our lin- 
guists and archeologists can 
make some sense out of this 
junk here.” 

“Let’s hope so,” Gwann 
said. ‘The mysteriousness of 
this whole thing is going to 
drive me crazy if they don’t.” 

“Well, sir,” said Drog, con- 
sulting his charts, “if we’re 
going to take advantage of 
juxtaposition of the two 
planets — ” 

“Right,” said Gwann, turn- 
ing and making his way to- 
ward the pilot’s compartment. 
“We’ll depart from Earth in 
ten minutes. Secure all hatches 



TO EACH HIS OWN 



99 




and loose objects until we get 
into space.” 

The crew hurried to their 
tasks. 

H alfway to Venus, voi- 
val, paging idly through 
one of the rotting books from 
Earth, gave a shout. 

“What is it?” said Gwann, 
coming into the light-beam 
operator’s compartment, 
stretching to ease the- muscle 
cramps from his long stint in 
the pilot’s cabin. 

“I’ve found a picture of the 
carnivore, sir!” said Volval 
proudly. “Look, sir.” 

“Hmm,” said Gwann, study- 
ing the fading illustration. “I 
believe you’re right. Jorik!” 
The biochemist popped into 
the compartment, his face cu- 
rious. “Yes, sir? What is it?” 
“Isn’t this one of your car- 
nivores, Jorik?” asked Gwann, 
giving him the book. 

Jorik, reaching for the 
book, nudged one of the news- 
papers atop the stack near the 
cabin wall, and the front page 
fluttered unnoticed to the floor. 
Across its surface were spread 



the incomprehensible — to Ve- 
nusian eyes — ^words : 

LITHIUM BOMB TEST 
COULD DESTROY WORLD 

Noted Scientist Declares Dan- 
ger of Polar Experiment ; 

Melted Polar Caps 
May Flood En- 
tire Globe 

Jorik studied the picture 
carefully, his gills trickling a 
faint stream of bubbles as he 
concentrated on the image of 
the carnivore. “Yes, that’s one 
of them, sure enough. I wish 
I could read Earth writing. I 
wonder just what a T-i-g-e-r- 
s-h-a-r-k is.” 

Volval bobbed up from his 
place and floated to a port in 
the ceiling, through which he 
could see the tiny, glittering 
ball of Earth, its blue-green 
surface sparkling like a star 
against the black backdrop of 
empty space. 

“I can’t understand w^t 
killed them,” he said. “Living 
conditions were ideal”

THE AUTUMN AFTER NEXT 



By MARGARET ST. CLAIR 



Being a wizard missionary to the Free’l 



needed more than magic — 



it called for a miracle! 



T he spell the Free’l were 
casting ought to have 
drawn the moon down from 
the heavens, made water run 
uphill, and inverted the order 
of the seasons. But, since they 
had got broor’s blood instead 
of newt’s, were using alganon 
instead of vervet juice, and 
were three days later than the 
solstice anyhow, nothing hap- 
pened. 

Neeshan watched their an- 
tics with a bitter smile. 

He’d tried hard with them. 



The Free’l were really a chal- 
lenge to evangelical wizardry. 
They had some natural talent 
for magic, as was evinced by 
the frequent attempts they 
made to perform it, and they 
were interested in what he 
told them about its capacities. 
But they simply wouldn’t take 
the trouble to do it right. 

How long had they been 
stamping around in their cir- 
cle, anyhow? Since early 
moonset, and it was now al- 
most dawn. No doubt they 



101 




would go on stamping all next 
day, if not interrupted. It was 
time to call a halt. 

Neeshan strode into the 
middle of the circle. Rhn, the 
village chief, looked up from 
his drumming. 

“Go away,” he said. “You'll 
spoil the chann." 

“What charm? Can't you 
see by now, Rhn, that it isn't 
going to work?” 

^'Of course it will. It just 
takes time.” 

'‘Hell it will. Hell it does. 
Watch.” 

Neeshan pushed Rhn to one 
side and squatted down in the 
center ofr the circle. From the 
pockets of his black robe he 
produced stylus, dragon's 
blood, oil of anointing, and 
salt. 

He drew a design on the 
ground with the stylus, drop- 
ped dragon's blood at the cor- 
ners of the parallelogram, and 
touched the inner cusps with 
the oil. Then, sighting careful- 
ly at the double red and white 
sun, which was just coming 
up, he touched the outer cusps 
with salt. An intense smoke 
sprang up. 

W HEN the smoke died 
away, a small lizardlike 
creature was visible in the 
parallelogram. 

“Tell the demon what you 
want,” Neeshan ordered the 
Free'l. 

The Free'l hesitated. They 
had few wants, after all, 
which was one of the things 

102 



that made teaching them mag- 
ic difficult. 

“Two big dyla melons,” one 
of the younger ones said at 
last. 

“A new andana necklace,” 
said another. 

“A tooter like the one you 
have,” said Rhn, who was am- 
bitious. 

“Straw for a new roof on 
my hut,” said one of the older 
females. 

“That's enough for now,” 
Neeshan interrupted. “The 
demon can't bring you a toot- 
er, Rhn — you have to ask an- 
other sort of demon for that. 
The other things he can get. 
Sammel, to work!” 

The lizard in the parallelo- 
gram twitched its tail. It dis- 
appeared, and returned almost 
immediately with melons, a 
handsome necklace, and an 
enormous heap of straw. 

“Can I go now?” it asked. 

“Yes.” Neeshan turned to 
the Free'l, who were sharing 
the dyla melons out around 
their circle. “You see? ThaVs 
how it ought to be. You cast a 
spell. You're careful with it. 
And it works. Right away.” 

“When you do it, it works,” 
Rhn answered. 

“Magic works when any- 
body does it. But you have to 
do it right.” 

Rhn raised his mud-plaster- 
ed shoulders in a shrug. “It's 
such a lot of dreeze, doing it 
that way. Magic ought to be 
fun.” He walked away, 
munching on a slice of the 



MARGARET ST. CLAIR 




melon the demon had brought. 

Neeshan stared after him, 
his eyes hot. “Dreeze” was a 
Free’l word that referred 
originally to the nasal drip 
that accompanied that race’s 
virulent head colds. It had 
been extended to mean almost 
anything annoying. The 
Free’l, who spent much of 
their time sitting in the rain, 
had a lot of colds in the head. 

Wasn’t there anything to be 
done with these people? Even 
the simplest spell was too 
dreezish for them to bother 
with. 

He was getting a headache. 
He’d better perform a head- 
ache-removing spell. 

He retired to the hut the 
Free’l had assigned to him. 
The spell worked, of course, 
but it left him feeling soggy 
and dispirited. He was still 
standing in the hut, wonder- 
ing what he should do next, 
when his big black-and-gold 
tooter in the corner gave a 
faint “woof.” That meant 
headquarters wanted to com- 
municate with him. 

Neeshan carefully aligned 
the tooter, which is basically 
a sort of lens for focusing 
neural force, with the rising 
double suns. He moved his 
couch out into a parallel posi- 
tion and lay down on it. In a 
minute or two he was deep in 
a cataleptic trance. 

The message from head- 
quarters was long, circuitous, 
and couched in the elaborate, 
ego-caressing ceremonial of 

THE AUTUMN AFTER NEXT 



high magic, but its gist was 
clear enough. 

“Your report received,” it 
boiled down to. “We are glad 
to hear that you are keeping 
on with the Free’l. We do not 
expect you to succeed with 
them — none of the other mag- 
ical missionaries we have sent 
out ever has. But if you 
should succeed, by any chance, 
you would get your senior 
warlock’s rating immediately. 
It would be no exaggeration, 
in fact, to say that the high- 
est offices in the Brotherhood 
would be open to you.” 

N eeshan came out of his 
trance. His eyes were 
round with wonder and cupid- 
ity. His senior warlock’s rat- 
ing — why, he wasn’t due to 
get that for nearly four 
more six hundred-and-five-day 
years. And the higest offices 
in the Brotherhood — ^that 
could mean anything. Any- 
thing! He hadn’t realized the 
Brotherhood set such store on 
converting the Free’l. Well, 
now, a reward like that was 
worth going to some trouble 
for. 

Neeshan sat down on his 
couch, his elbows on his knees, 
his fists pressed against his 
forehead, and tried to think. 

The Free’l liked magic, but 
they were lazy. Anything that 
involved accuracy impressed 
them as dreezish. And they 
didn’t want anything. That 
was the biggest difficulty. 
Magic had nothing to offer 

103 




them. He had never, Neeshan 
thought, heard one of the 
Free’l express a want. 

Wait, though. There was 
Rhn. 

He had shown a definite 
interest in Neeshan’s footer. 
Something in its intricate, 
florid black-and-gold curves 
seemed to fascinate him. True, 
he hadn’t been interested in 
it for its legitimate uses, 
w'hich were to extend and de- 
velop a magician’s spiritual 
power. He probably thought 
that having it would give him 
more prestige and influence 
among his people. But for one 
of the Free’l to say “I wish I 
had that” about anything 
whatever meant that he could 
be worked on. Could the foot- 
er be used as a bribe? 

Neeshan sighed heavily. 
Getting a footer was painful 
and laborious. A footer was 
carefully fitted to an individ- 
ual magician’s personality ; in 
a sense, it was a part of his 
personality, and if Neeshan 
let Rhn have his footer, he 
would be letting him have a 
part of himself. But the 
stakes were enormous. 

Neeshan got up from his 
couch. It had begun to rain, 
but he didn’t want to spend 
time performing a rain-re- 
pelling spell. He wanted to 
find Rhn. 

Rhn was standing at the 
edge of the swamp, luxuriat- 
ing in the downpour. The 
mud had washed from his 
shoulders, and he was already 

104 



sniffling. Neeshan came to the 
point directly. 

“I’ll give you my footer,’’ 
he said, almost choking over 
the words, “if you’ll do a spell 
— a simple spell, mind you — 
exactly right.” 

Rhn hesitated. Neeshan felt 
an impulse to kick him. Then 
he said, “Well ...” 

Neeshan began his instruc- 
tions. It wouldn’t do for him 
to help Rhn too directly, but 
he was willing to do every- 
thing reasonable. Rhn listen- 
ed, scratching himself in the 
armpits and sneezing from 
time to time. 

After Neeshan had been 
through the directions twice, 
Rhn stopped him. “No, don’t 
bother telling me again — it’s 
just more dreeze. Give me the 
materials and I’ll show you. 
Don’t forget, you’re giving 
me the footer for this.” 

H e started off, Nee- 
shan after him, to the lat- 
ter’s hut. While Neeshan 
looked on tensely, Rhn began 
going through the actions 
Neeshan had told him. Half- 
way through the first decad, 
he forgot. He inverted the or- 
der of the hand-passes, sprin- 
kled salt on the wrong point, 
and mispronounced the names 
in the invocation. When he 
pulled his hands apart at the 
end, only a tiny yellow flame 
sprang up. 

Neeshan cursed bitterly. 
Rhn, however, was delighted. 
“Look at that, will you!” he 



MARGARET ST. CLAIR 




exclaimed, clapping his chap- 
ped, scabby little hands to- 
gether. “It worked! I'll take 
the tooter home with me 
now.” 

“The tooter? For that? 
You didn’t do the spell right.” 
Rhn stared at him indig- 
nantly. “You mean, you’re 
not going to give me the toot- 
er after all the trouble I went 
to? I only did it as a fay or, 
really. Neeshan, I think it’s 
very mean of you.” 

“Try the spell again.” 

“Oh, dreeze. You’re too im- 
patient. You never give any- 
thing time to work.” 

He got up and walked off. 
For the next few days, 
everybody in the village 
avoided Neeshan. They all felt 
sorry for Rhn, who’d worked 
so hard, done everything he 
was told to, and been cheated 
out of his tooter by Neeshan. 
In the end the magician, curs- 
ing his own weakness, surren- 
dered the tooter to Rhn. The 
accusatory atmosphere in the 
normally indifferent Free’l 
was intolerable. 

But now what was he to 
do? He’d given up his tooter 
— he had to ask Rhn to lend 
it to him when he wanted 
to contact headquarters — and 
the senior rating was no 
nearer than before. His head 
ached constantly, and all the 
spells he performed to cure 
the pain left him feeling 
wretchedly tired out. 

Magic, however, is an art 
of many resources, not all of 

THE AUTUMN AFTER NEXT 



them savory. Neeshan, in his 
desperation, began to invoke 
demons more disreputable 
than those he would ordinar- 
ily have consulted. In effect, 
he turned for help to the 
magical underworld. 

His thuggish informants 
were none too consistent. One 
demon told him one thing, an- 
other something else. The 
consensus, though, was that 
while there was nothing the 
Free’l actually wanted enough 
to go to any trouble for it 
(they didn’t even want to get 
rid of their nasal drip, for 
example — in a perverse way 
they were proud of it), there 
was one thing they disliked 
intensely — Neeshan himself. 

The Free’l thought, the 
demons reported, that he was 
inconsiderate, tactless, offi- 
cious, and a crashing bore. 
They regarded him as the 
psychological equivalent of 
the worst case of dreeze ever 
known, carried to the nth 
power. They wished he’d drop 
dead or hang himself. 

Neeshan dismissed the last 
of the demons. His eyes had 
begun to shine. The Free’l 
thought he was a nuisance, 
did they? They thought he 
was the most annoying thing 
they’d encountered in the 
course of their racial history? 
Good. Fine. Splendid. Then 
he’d really annoy them. 

He’d have to watch out for 
poison, of course. But in the 
end, they’d turn to magic to 
get rid of him. They’d have to. 

105 




And then he’d have them. 
They’d be caught. 

One act of communal magic 
that really worked and they’d 
be sold on magic. He’d be sure 
of his senior rating. 

N EESHAN began his cam- 
paign immediately. Where 
the Free’l were, there was he. 
He was always on hand with 
unwanted explanations, hy- 
percritical objections, and 
maddening “wouldn’t -it- be - 
betters.” 

Whereas earlier in his 
evangelical mission he had 
confined himself to pointing 
out how much easier magic 
would make life for the Free’l, 
he now counciled and advised 
them on every phase of their 
daily routine, from mud- 
smearing to rain-sitting, and 
from the time they got up un- 
til they went to bed. He even 
pursued them with advice 
after they got into bed, and 
told them how to run their 
sex lives — advice which the 
Free’], who set quite as much 
store by their sex lives as any- 
body does, resented passion- 
ately. 

But most of all he harped 
on their folly in putting up 
with nasal drip, and instruct- 
ed them over and over again 
in the details of a charm — a 
quite simple charm — for get- 
ting rid of it. The charm 
would, he informed them, 
work equally well against 
anything — or person — that 
they found annoying. 

106 



The food the Free’l brought 
him began to have a highly 
peculiar taste. Neeshan grin- 
ned and hung a theriacal 
charm, a first-class antidote 
to poison, around his neck. 
The Free’l’s distate for him 
bothered him, naturally, but 
he could stand it. When he 
had repeated the anti-annoy- 
ance charm to a group of 
Free’l last night, he had no- 
ticed that Rhn was listening 
eagerly. It wouldn’t be much 
longer now. 

On the morning of the day 
before the equinox, Neeshan 
was awakened from sleep by 
an odd prickling sensation in 
his ears. It was a sensation 
he’d experienced only once be- 
fore in his life, during his 
novitiate, and it took him a 
moment to identify it. Then 
he realized what it was. Some- 
body was casting a spell 
against him. 

At last! At last! It had 
worked ! 

Neeshan put on his robe 
and hurried to the door of the 
hut. The day seemed remark- 
ably overcast, almost like 
night, but that was caused by 
the spell. This one happened 
to involve the optic nerves. 

He began to grope his way 
cautiously toward the village 
center. He didn’t want the 
Free’l to see him and get sus- 
picious, but he did want to 
have the pleasure of seeing 
them cast their first accurate 
spell. (He was well protected 
against wind-damage from it, 

/MRGARET ST. CLAIR 




of course.) When he was al- 
most at the center, he took 
cover behind a hut. He peered 
out. 

They were doing it right. Oh, 
what a satisfaction! Neeshan 
felt his chest expand with 
pride. And when the spell 
worked, when the big wind 
swooped down and blew him 
away, the Free'l would cer- 
tainly receive a second magi- 
cal missionary more kindly. 
Neeshan might even come 
back, well disguised, himself. 

The ritual went on. The 
dancers made three circles to 
the left, three circles to the 
right. Cross over, and all 
sprinkle salt on the interstices 
of the star Rhn had traced on 
the ground with the point of 
a knife. Back to the circle. 
One to the left, one to right, 
while Rhn, in the center of the 
circle, dusted over the salt 
with — with what ? 

“lley!’’ Neeshan yelled in 
sudden alarm. “Not brim- 
stone! Watch out! You're not 
doing it ri — " 

His chest contracted sud- 
denly, as if a large, stony 
hand had seized his thorax 
above the waist. He couldn't 
breathe, he couldn't think, he 



couldn't even say “Ouch!” It 
felt as if his chest — no, his 
whole body — was being com- 
pressed in on itself and turn- 
ing into something as hard as 
stone. 

He tried to wave his tiny, 
heavy arms in a counter- 
charm; he couldn't even in- 
hale. The last emotion he 
experienced was one of bitter- 
ness. He might have known 
the Free'l couldn't get any- 
thing right. 

T he Free'l take a dim view 
of the small stone image 
that now stands in the center 
of their village. It is much too 
heavy for them to move, and 
while it is not nearly so much 
of a nuisance as Neeshan was 
when he was alive, it incon- 
veniences them. They have to 
make a detour around it when 
they do their magic dances. 

They still hope, though, that 
the spells they are casting to 
get rid of him will work even- 
tually. If he doesn't go away 
this autumn, he will the au- 
tumn after next. They have a 
good deal of faith in magic, 
when you come right down to 
it. And patience is their long 
suit. END

How Muld any race look so 



ferocious and yet he peace- 



ful — and devise so nasty a 



weapon? 



I 

I COULDN’T help listening 
to the big spaceman sitting 
alone at the corner table. He 
wasn’t speaking to me — that 
was certain — nor was his flat, 
curiously uninflected voice di- 
rected at anyone else. With 
some sui'prise I realized that 
he was talking to himself. 
People don’t do that nowa- 
days. They’re adjusted. 

He noted my raised eye- 
brows and grinned, his square 
teeth white against the dark 
planes of his face. “I’m not 
psycho,’’ he said. “It’s just a 
bad habit I picked up on 
Lyrane.” 

“Lyrane?” I asked. 

“It hasn’t been entered on 
the charts yet. Just discover- 
ed.’’ His voice was inflected 
now. And then it changed 
abruptly. “If you must know, 
this is ethanol — C oHjjOHt— 



111 




and I drink it.” He looked at 
me with an embarrassed ex- 
pression in his blue eyes. “It’s 
just that I’m not used to it 
yet,” he explained without ex- 
plaining. “It’s easier when I 
vocalize.” 

“You sure you’re all right?” 
I asked. “Want me to call a 
psychologician ?” 

“No. I’ve just been certified 
by Decontamination. I have a 
paper to prove it.” 

“But—” 

“Draw up a chair,” he in- 
vited. “I hate to drink alone. 
And I’d like to talk to some- 
body.” 

I smiled. My talent was 
working as usual. I can’t walk 
into a bar without someone 
telling me his life history. 
Nice old ladies buttonhole me 
at parties and tell me all about 
their childhoods. Boys tell me 
about girls. Girls tell me about 
boys. Politicians spill party 
secrets and pass me tips. 

Something about me makes 
folks want to talk. It’s a tal- 
ent and in my business it’s an 
asset. You see. I’m a freelance 
writer. Nothing fancy or sig- 
nificant, just news, popular 
stuff, adventure stories, prob- 
lem yarns, romances, and mys- 
teries. I’ll never go down in 
history as a literary great, but 
it’s a living — and besides I 
meet the damnedest charac- 
ters. 

So I sat down. 

“I guess you’re not conta- 
gious if you’ve been through 
Decontamination,” I said. 



H e looked at me across 
the rim of an oversized 
brandy sniffer — a Napoleon, 
I think it’s called — and wag- 
gled a long forefinger at my 
nose. “The trouble wfith you 
groundhogs is that you’re al- 
ways thinking we spacers are 
walking hotbeds of contagion 
all primed to wreck Earth. 
You should know better. Any- 
thing dangerous has about 
as much chance of getting 
through Decontamination as 
an ice cube has of getting 
through a nuclear furnace.” 
“There was Martian Fe- 
ver,” I reminded him. 

“Three centuries ago and 
you still remember it,” he 
said. “But has there been any- 
thing else since Decontamina- 
tion was set up?” 

“No,” I admitted, “but that 
was enough, wasn’t it? We 
still haven’t reached the pre- 
Mars population level.” 

“Who wants to?” He sipped 
at the brownish fluid in the 
glass and a shudder rippled 
the heavy muscles of his chest 
and shoulders. He grinned 
nastily and took a bigger 
drink. “There, that ought to 
hold you,” he muttered. He 
looked at me, that odd embar- 
rassed look glinting in his 
eyes. “I think that did it. No 
tolerance for alcohol.” 

I gave him my puzzled and 
expectant look. 

He countered with a gesture 
at the nearly empty brandy 
glass. I got the idea. I signaled 
autoservice — a conditioned re-

flex developed over years of 
pumping material out of 
spacemen — and slipped my ID 
into the check slot of the robot 
as it rolled up beside us and 
waited, humming expectantly. 

“Rum,” the spaceman said. 
“Demerara, four ounces.” 
“You are cautioned, sir,” 
the autoservice said in a flat 
mechanical voice. “Demerara 
rum is one hundred fifty proof 
and is not meant to be ingested 
by terrestrial life-forms with- 
out prior dilution.” 

“Shut up and serve,” I said. 
The robot clicked disapprov- 
ingly, gurgled briefly inside its 
cubical interior and extruded 
a pony glass of brownish 
liquid. “Sir, you will undoubt- 
edly end up in a drunkard’s 
grave, dead of hepatic cirrho- 
sis,” it informed me virtuous- 
ly as it returned my ID card. 
I glared as I pushed the glass 
across the table. 

“Robots,” I said contemptu- 
ously. It was lost on that me- 
tallic monstrosity. It was al- 
ready rolling away toward 
another table. 

The spaceman poured the 
pony glass into his Napoleon, 
sniffed appreciatively, sipped 
delicately and extended a 
meaty hand. “My name’s Hal- 
sey,” he said. “Captain Roger 
Halsey. I skipper the Two Txvo 
Four.” 

“The Bureau ship that land- 
ed this morning?” 

He nodded. “Yeah. I’m one 
of the Bureau’s brave boys.” 
There was a faint sneer in his 



voice. “The good old Bureau 
of Extraterrestrial Explora- 
tion. The busy BEE.” He fail- 
ed to pronounce the individual 
letters. “You’re a reporter, 
aren’t you?” he asked sud- 
denly. 

“How’d you guess?” 

“That little trick of not an- 
swering an introduction. Most 
of you sludge pumpers do it, 
but I never knew why.” 
“Libel and personal privacy 
laws,” I said. “If you don’t 
know who we are, you can*t 
sue.” 

He grinned. “Okay. I don't 
care. Keep your privacy. All 
I want is someone to talk to.” 
I smiled inwardly. 

“Think my job’s exciting?” 
he asked. “Skipper of an ex- 
ploration ship. Poking my nose 
into odd corners of the Galaxy. 
Seeing what’s over Hie hill.” 
“Of course,” I said. 

“Well, you’d be wrong 
ninety-nine times out of a 
hundred. It's just a job. Most 
of it is checking — or did you 
know that only one sun in ten 
has planets, and only one in 
ten thousand has a spectrum 
that will support human life, 
and that only one in ten thou- 
sand planets has Earthlike 
qualities? So you can imagine 
how we felt when we ran 
across Lyrane.” He grimaced 
wryly. “I had it on the log as 
Halsey’s Planet for nearly two 
weeks before we discovered it 
was inhabited.” He shrugged. 
“So the 4iame was changed. 
Too bad. Always did want to 

113 



CULTURAL EXCHANGE 




have a planet named after me. 
But ni make it yet.” 

I clucked sympathetically. 
Capt, Halsey sighed, and this 
is what he told me. 

II 

I T’S a beautiful world, Ly- 
rane is. Like Earth must 
have been before it got clut- 
tered up with people. No 
cities, no smoke, no industrial 
complexes — ^just green plains, 
snowy mountains, dark for- 
ests, blue seas, and white polar 
caps all wrapped in cotton 
clouds swimming in the clear- 
est atmosphere you ever saw. 
It made my eyes ache to look 
at it. And it affected the crew 
the same way. 

We were wild to land. We 
came straight in along the 
equatorial plane until we hit 
the Van Allen Belt and the 
automatics took over. We 
stopped dead, matched intrin- 
sics and skirted the outer 
band, checking the radiation 
quality and the shape of the 
Belt. It was a pure band that 
dipped down at the poles to 
form entry zones. There was 
not a sign of bulges or indus- 
trial contaminants. 

Naturally we had every- 
thing trained on the planet 
while we made our sweeps — 
organic detectors, radar, spec- 
troanalytic probes — all the 
gadgets the BEE equips us 
with to make analysis easy 
and complete. The readings 
were so homelike that every 



man was landsick. I wasn’t 
any different from the rest of 
them, but I was in command 
and I had to be cautious about 
setting the Two Two Four 
down until we’d really wrung 
the analytic data dry. 

So, while the crew grumbled 
about hanging outside on a 
skyhook, we kept swinging 
around in a polar orbit until 
we knew that world below us 
like a baby knows its mother. 
It checked clean to five decimal 
places, which is the limit of 
our gadgetry. Paradise, that’s 
what it was — a paradise un- 
trod by human foot. And 
eveiy foot on the ship was 
itching. 

“When we gonna land. 
Skipper?” Alex Baranov ask- 
ed me. It was a gross breach 
of discipline, but I forgave 
him. Alex was the second en- 
gineer, an eager kid on his 
first flight out from Earth. 
Like most youngsters, he 
thought there was romance in 
space, but right now he was 
landsick. Even worse than 
most of us. And, like most 
kids, he’d leap where angels’d 
dread to walk on tiptoe. 

“We’ll land,” I assured him. 
“You’ll be down there pretty 
soon.” 

He hurried off to tell the 
others. 

We set the ship down in the 
middle of one of the continen- 
tal land masses in an open 
plain surrounded by forest 
and ran a few more tests be- 
fore we stepped out, planted 



114

the flag, and claimed the place 
for the Confederation. After 
that we had an impromptu 
celebration to thoroughly en- 
joy the solid feel of ground 
under our feet and open sky 
overhead. It lasted all of five 
minutes before we came to 
our senses and posted a guard. 

It was five minutes too long. 
Alex Baranov had a chance to 
get out of sight and go explor- 
ing, and, like a kid, he took it. 
We didn’t miss him for nearly 
ten minutes more, and in fif- 
teen minutes a man can cover 
quite a bit of territory. 

“Anyone see where he 
went?” I asked. 

“He was wearing a menti- 
com,” one of the crew offered. 
“Said he wanted to look 
around.” 

“The idiot!” I snapped. “He 
had no business going off like 
that.” 

“Nobody told him not to,” 
Dan Warren said. Dan was 
my executive officer, and a 
good hand in case of trouble, 
but he left the command deci- 
sions to me, and of course I 
figured that everybody knew 
the cardinal rule of first land- 
ings. The net result was that 
Alex had disappeared. 

I went back into the ship 
and broke out another men- 
ticom. 

“Alex !” I broadcasted. “Re- 
turn to ship at once !” 

“I can’t, Skipper,” Alex's 
projection came back to me, 
“I’m surrounded.” 

“By what? Where?” 

CULTURAL EXCHANGE 



“They look sorta human — 
bigger than us. I’m near the 
edge of the forest nearest the 
ship. I can’t do anything. I 
didn’t bring a blaster.” There 
was panic in his thoughts. 
And then suddenly I saw two 
hairy bipeds flash across 
Alex’s vision. Both of them 
were carrying spears. The 
nearest one jumped and lung- 
ed. The scene dissolved in a 
blaze of red panic and the pro- 
jection cut off as though some- 
one had turned a switch. 

I had a fix now and turned 
to face a knob of forest jutting 
out into the plain. Near the 
forest’s edge I saw a flurry of 
movement that vanished as I 
watched. 

“Break out a ’copter,” I or- 
dered. 

“Why?” Warren asked, and 
then I realized that I alone of 
all the crew had seen what 
had happened to Alex. 

I told them. 

T he search, of course, was 
unproductive. I didn’t ex- 
pect that it would be anything 
else. I was pretty certain that 
Alex was a casualty, I’d felt 
people die while wearing men- 
ticoms, and the same blank 
sense of emptiness had blotted 
out Alex. It was a bad deal all 
around, I liked that kid. 

But Alex’s death had pro- 
vided data. This world was in- 
habited and the inhabitants 
weren’t friendly. So I had the 
crew stake out a perimeter 
which we could energize with 

1U 




the ship’s engines, and acti- 
vated a couple of autoguards 
for patrol duty. Alex wasn’t 
a pleasant thought, but we 
weren’t equipped to retrieve 
bodies. So I wrote him in the 
log as missing and let it go at 
that. 

I had to correct the entry a 
week later when Alex came 
walking up to the perimeter 
as large as life and just as 
healthy, wearing a mild sun- 
burn, a sheepish expression, 
and nothing else. 

The autoguard announced 
his coming and I headed the 
delegation that met him. I 
read him the riot act, and 
after I’d finished chewing on 
him he was pinker than ever. 

“Okay, sir — so I was a 
fool,” he said. “But they didn’t 
hurt me. Scared me half to 
death, but once they realized 
I was intelligent there was no 
trouble. They were fascinated 
by my clothes.” Alex grinned 
ruefully. “And they’re pretty 
strong. They peeled me.” 

“Obviously,” I said coldly. 

“They have a village back 
in the woods.” He pointed 
vaguely behind him. “It’d pay 
to take a look at it.” 

“Mister Baranov,” I said. 
“If I don’t throw you in the 
brig for what you’ve done, it’s 
only because you may have 
brought back some informa- 
tion we can use. What are 
these natives like? What did 
they do to you besides making 
you a strip-tease artist? What 
cultural level are they? How 

116 



many of them do you estimate 
there are? What do they look 
like? Get up to the ship and 
report to Lieutenant Warren 
for interrogation and draw 
new clothing.” I had the same 
half exasperated, half angry 
tone that a relieved mother 
has when one of her young- 
sters returns home late but 
unharmed. 

A lex must have recognized 
it, because he grinned as 
he went off. 

I contacted Warren on the 
intercom. “Dan,” I said, “Ba- 
ranov’s back — apparently un- 
harmed. I want him given the 
works. When you’ve gotten 
everything you can get, have 
a man detailed to watch him. 
If he so much as looks suspi- 
cious, heave him in the brig.” 
Warren’s answering projec- 
tion had a laugh in it. “Always 
cautious, hey. Skipper? Okay, 
I’ll see that he gets the busi- 
ness.” 

It turned out that Alex 
didn’t have much real infor- 
mation except for a descrip- 
tion of the natives, their vil- 
lage, and their attitude toward 
him. It was about what you’d 
expect from a kid, interesting 
but far from helpful. 

The delegation of natives 
showed up a half hour later. 
They came walking across the 
open space between the ship 
and the forest as though they 
hadn’t a care in the world. 
Four of them — ^big hairy hu- 
manoids, carrying spears. 

J. F. BONE 




They were naked as animals. 
Not that they needed clothes 
with all that hair, but just the 
same their appearance gave 
me a queasy feeling — like I 
was looking at man’s early an- 
cestors suddenly come to life. 

If you can imagine a furry 
humanoid seven feet tall, with 
the face of an intelligent go- 
rilla and the braincase of a 
man, you’ll have a rough idea 
of what they looked like — ex- 
cept for their teeth. The ca- 
nines would have fitted better 
in the face of a tiger, and 
showed at the corners of their 
wide, thin-lipped mouths, giv- 
ing them an expression of 
ferocity. 

They came trotting straight 
across the plain, moving with 
grace and power. All external 
signs pointed to them being a 
carnivorous, primitive race. 
Hunters, probably. The mus- 
cles of my scalp twitched as 
some deep-buried instinct in- 
side me whispered, “Competi- 
tion!” 

I ’VE met plenty of human- 
oids, but these were the 
first that roused any emotion 
other than curiosity. Perhaps 
it was their fierce appearance, 
or the bright, half-contemptu- 
ous intelligence in their eyes, 
or the confident arrogance in 
their approach, or merely that 
they looked more like us than 
the others I had met. What- 
ever it was, it was strong, and 
I had the impression that the 
feeling was mutual. 

CULTURAL EXCHANGE 



“Stop!” I said as they ap- 
proached the periphery. 

“Why should we?” the fore- 
most native replied in perfect 
Terran. 

“Because that barrier’ll 
bum you to a nice crisp cinder 
if you don’t.” 

“That’s a good reason,” the 
native said, nodding. 

Then the delayed reaction 
took over and the shock nearly 
floored me, until I saw' that 
he was w'earing Alex’s men- 
ticom. Well, that explained the 
language and the feeling of 
mutual distrust — and it could 
explain why I thought Alex 
had died back there in the jun- 
gle. A mental communicator 
snatched from its wearer’s 
head can give that impression. 

But it raised an entirely 
new set of questions. Where 
did this savage learn to oper- 
ate the circlet and how did he 
recognize its purpose? I guess 
I w'asn’t too smart, because 
the native was tuned to me 
and I wasn’t shielding my 
thoughts at all. 

He chuckled — it sounded 
like the purr of a cat. “We are 
not stupid, Earthman.” 

“So I see,” I said uneasily. 

“I am K’wan, chief of this 
segment. 1 wish to know why 
you are here.” 

“To survey your world. We 
are members of the Bureau of 
Extraterrestrial Exploration. 
It is our job to make surveys 
of planets.” 

“Why?” 

“For trade, colonization, 

117 




and exploitation,” I answered. 
There was no sense in giving 
him a dishonest explanation. 
With him wearing that com- 
municator, it would have done 
no good to try. 

“And what have you de- 
cided about us?” 

“That’s not our job. We just 
investigate and report. What 
happens next is not our affair. 
But if you’re worrying — don’t. 
There are plenty of worlds 
available without bothering 
inhabited places. Since you 
are intelligent, we would prob- 
ably like to trade with you, if 
you have anything to trade — 
but that, of course, is up to 
you. We never intrude where 
we are not wanted, as long as 
we are treated with respect. 
If we are attacked, however, 
that is a different story.” It 
was the old respect-and-threat 
routine that worked with 
primitive races. But I wasn’t 
at all sure it was working 
npw. 

“Strange,” K’wan said. “I 
would have sworn you were 
a predatory race. You are 
enough like us to be our little 
cousins.” He scratched his 
head with a surprisingly hu- 
man gesture. “In your posi- 
tion I would have attacked to 
show my power and inspire 
respect. Perhaps you are tell- 
ing the truth.” 

“A predator can grow soft 
when he has too much prey,” 
1 said. 

“Aye, there is truth in that. 
But what is too easy and how 

118 



much is too much? And does 
a man change his habits of 
eating just because he is fat?” 
“You can find out.” 

“I do not think that would 
be wise,” the native said. “Al- 
though you are physically 
weak, you sound confident. 
Therefore you are strong. And 
strength is to be respected. Let 
us be friends. We will make an 
agreement with you.” 

1 SHOOK my head. “It is not 
our place to make agree- 
ments. We only observe.” 
“You have not done much of 
that,” he said pointedly. “You 
sit here and send your ma- 
chines over our seas and for- 
ests, but you do not see for 
yourselves. You cannot learn 
this way.” 

“We learn enough,” I said 
shortly. 

“We have talked of you at 
our council,” K’wan continued, 
“and we think that you should 
know more before you depart. 
So we have come to make you 
an offer. Let four of your men 
come with me, and four of 
mine will stay with you. We 
will exchange — and you can 
see our ways while we see 
yours. That would help us un- 
derstand each other.” 

It sounded reasonable. An 
exchange of hostages — or call 
it a cultural exchange, if you’d 
prefer. I told him that I’d 
think it over and to come back 
tomorrow. He nodded, tunied, 
and together with his retinue 
disappeared into the jungle. 

J. F. BONE 




W E HASHED K’wan’s 
proposal over at a board 
meeting that night and de- 
cided that we’d take it. The 
exact status of Lyranian cul- 
ture worried us. It is a cardi- 
nal rule never to underesti- 
mate an alien culture or to 
judge it by surface appear- 
ances. So we organized a team 
that would form our part of 
the “cultural exchange.” 

I would go, of course. If 
K’wan could visit us, I could 
hardly stay back. Alex was 
selected partly because he was 
an engineer, mostly because 
he’d been over the ground 
before. Ed Barger, our ecolo- 
gist, and Patrick Allardyce, 
our biologist, made up the re- 
mainder of the party. I’d have 
liked to take the padre and 
Doc, but Doc was more valua- 
ble at base, and if I could have 
only four men, I wanted fight- 
ing men. 

“Now,” I said, “we’ll take 
along a tight-beam communi- 
cator. Coupled to our menti- 
coms, it should be able to 
reach the ship and put what 
we see and what happens on 
permanent record.” Then I 
turned to Dan Warren. “If 
anything goes wrong, don’t try 
to rescue us. Finish your ob- 
servations and get out. You 
understand? And get those ex- 
change natives into Interroga- 
tion. Condition them to the 
eyeballs with cooperation dog- 
ma. We may need some 
friends here when the second 
echelon makes a landfall.” 



Warren nodded. I didn’t 
have to elaborate. 

The native village was 
about what I expected from 
our reconnaissance flights. It 
was beautifully camouflaged. 
You couldn’t tell it from the 
rest of the forest except that 
the trees were larger and were 
hollow — apparently hewn out 
with patient care to make a 
comfortable living space in- 
side. Lyranians lived in one 
place, if what I could see of 
their dwellings was any crite- 
rion. I wanted to look inside, 
but K’wan hustled us down the 
irregular “street” that wound 
through the grove of giant 
trees until we finally came to 
the granddaddy of them all, a 
trunk nearly forty feet in 
diameter. 

K’wan gestured at the tree. 
“Your house while you are 
here. We made it for you 
Earthmen.” His voice came 
over my menticom and was 
duly recorded on the ship, 
since we were in constant con- 
tact, giving our impressions 
of the place. So far it was 
strictly SOP. 

“Thanks,” I said. “We ap- 
preciate it.” I was really 
touched at this tribute. K’wan 
had probably evacuated his 
own house to furnish us quar- 
ters where we could be to- 
gether. The size of it indicated 
that it must be the chief’s 
residence. But like all primi- 
tives he had to lie a little and 
the fiction of making this place 
for us was a way of salvaging 

119

pSide in the face of our tech- 
nological superiority. 

He walked inside and we 
followed, expecting to find a 
gloomy hole — but instead the 
room glowed with a soft light 
that came from the walls 
themselves. The air was cool 
and comfortable, a pleasing 
contrast to the heat outside. 

“What the — ” I began, but 
Allardyce was already peering 
at the walls. 

“A type of luminous fun- 
gus,” he said. “A saprophyte. 
Lives on the wood of this tree 
and gives off light. Clever.” 

I shut my mouth and looked 
around. There were other 
rooms opening off this one and 
along one wall a knobby imita- 
tion of a staircase led upward 
to a hole overhead. 

“Hmmm, a regular sky- 
scraper,” Ed Barger com- 
mented, noting the direction 
of my gaze. “Well, we should 
not be crowded, at any rate.” 
I had been noticing some- 
thing was wrong without re- 
alizing it. You know the feel- 
ing you get when you’ve lost 
something, but can’t quite re- 
member what it was. Then my 
neurons made connections and 
I realized that the communi- 
cator and the menticom were 
both as dead as if we were in 
a lead box. 

Quietly I moved to the door 
— and Dan’s voice hammered 
in my ears : “Skipper ! Answer 
me! What’s wrong?” 

“Nothing, Dan,” I said. “We 
just went into the quarters 

120 



they assigned us. Something 
about them blocks transmis- 
sion and reception. We’re all 
fine.” 

“Oh.” Dan sounded relieved. 
“For a minute I was wor- 
ried.” 

“One of the boys’ll call in 
every two hours,” I assured 
him. “If you don’t hear from 
us then, it’ll be time to do 
something.” 

“Okay, Skipper, but what’ll 
I do?” 

“That’ll be your decision,” 
I said. “You’ll be ranking offi- 
cer.” 

Dan’s chuckle was humor- 
less. “Thanks, but I hope we 
keep on hearing from you.” 

“Don’t worry — you will. 
These people look worse than 
they really are. At least they 
have been nice so far.” 

“They’d better stay that 
way,” Dan replied grimly. 

It was my turn to chuckle. 
“Keep calm and keep your 
blasters dry. I’m going inside 
now. You’ll hear from us in 
two hours.” 

E d BARGER looked at me a 
trifle oddly as I came 
through the doorway. “A 
while ago you were laughing 
at that story K’wan was tell- 
ing us about making this 
house for us. I caught your 
undertone.” 

“Sure. What about it?” 
“Well, I’m not so sure he 
was lying.” 

“Huh?” 

“Take a look around you.” 



J. F. BONE 




I did. It was a nice room, 
considering its origin — low 
benches around the walls, a 
table and four chairs in the 
center, a soft, thick floor cov- 
ering that was a pleasure to 
the feet. 

“See anything unusual?” 
Ed asked. 

“No,” I said. 

“What about those bench- 
es?” 

“They’re part of the walls,” 
I said, “cut out of the tree 
when it was hollowed out.” 

“Cut to our size?” 

I did a double take. Barger 
was right. The Lyranians 
were seven feet tall and long- 
legged, but the benches were 
precisely right for human sit- 
ting, and the table in the cen- 
ter was only three feet above 
the gray floor. Suddenly I 
didn’t feel so good. 

“And those rooms — ^there 
are four of them — scaled to 
people our size ?” 

I shrugged. “So they modi- 
fied the joint for us.” 

“You still don’t get it. This 
place is living. It’s growing. 
Nothing here except those 
chairs isn’t part of this tree, 
and I’m not sure that they 
weren’t. Besides, how did they 
know that there’d be four of 
us?” 

“They could have been hope- 
ful, or maybe four is their 
idea of a delegation. Remem- 
ber there were four of them 
that visited us, and they sug- 
gested that four of us visit 
them.” 



“It’s obvious,” Allardyce 
added, "that this place has 
been made for us. K’wan 
wasn’t lying.” 

Barger shook his head. “I 
still don’t like it. I think we’3 
better get out of here. If they 
are as good biologists as this 
tree indicates, they’re a Class 
VI civilization at least — and 
we’re not set up to handle lev- 
els that high.” 

“I don’t think that’s neces- 
sary,” Allardyce said. “They 
don’t seem unfriendly, and un- 
til they do, we’re better off 
sitting pat and playing the 
cards as they’re dealt. We can 
always warn the ship in case 
anything goes wrong.” 

“Don’t be jumpy,” Alex 
broke in. “I told you they were 
all right. They grew the place 
for me. It’s just grown a little 
since.” 

I made a noncommittal 
noise. 

“It’s true,” Alex said. 
“While I was here I needed 
quarters and nobody wanted 
me in with them. They have 
some custom about not letting 
strangers in their houses after 
sunset. So they took a sapling 
and sprayed it with some sort 
of stuff and by the next “after- 
noon I had a one-room house.” 
“Where did you stay that 
first night?” I demanded. 

Alex shrugged. “In one of 
the trees down the street,” he 
said, pointing through the 
door. “It was some sort of a 
storage warehouse. No air 
conditioning and blacker than 

121

the inside of the Coal Sack. It 
rains pretty bad at night and 
they had to give me some 
shelter.” 

He was right on time with 
his last statement, because the 
skies opened up and started to 
pour. The four-hour evening 
rain had begun. It had fasci- 
nated us at first, the regular- 
ity with which the evening 
showers arrived and left, but 
our meteorologist assured us 
that it was a perfectly natural 
phenomenon in a planet with 
no axial tilt. 

“But growing a tree in a 
day is fantastic,” I said. 
“What’s more, it’s unbelieva- 
ble, a downright — ” 

“Not so fantastic,” Allar- 
dyce interrupted. “This really 
isn’t a tree. It’s a cycad — re- 
lated to the horsetail ferns 
back on Earth. They grow 
pretty fast anyway and they 
might grow faster here. Be- 
sides, the Lyranians could 
have some really potent 
growth stimulants. In our 
hydroponics stations we use 
delta-gibberelin. That’ll grow 
tomatoes from seed in a week, 
and forage crops in three days. 
It could be that they have 
something better that’ll do the 
job in hours.” 

“And one that makes a tree 
grow rooms?” I scoffed. 

A LLARDYCE nodded. “It’s 
possible, but I hate to 
think of the science behind it 
— it makes me feel like a blind 
baby fumbling in the dark — 

122 



and I’m supposed to be a good 
biologist.” He shivered. “Their 
science’ll be centuries ahead 
of ours if that is true.” 

“Not necessarily,” Barger 
said. “They could be good bi- 
ologists or botanists and no- 
thing much else. We’ve run 
into that sort of uneven cul- 
ture before.” 

“Ha!” Allardyce snorted. 
“That shows how little you 
know about experimental bi- 
ology. Anybody able to do with 
plants what these people do 
would have to know genetics 
and growth principles, bio- 
chemistry, mathematics, engi- 
neering and physics.” 

“Maybe they had it once 
and lost most of it,” I suggest- 
ed. “They wouldn’t be the first 
culture that’s gone retrograde. 
We did it after the Atomic 
Wars and we were several 
thousand years recovering. 
But we hadn’t lost the skills — 
they just degenerated into 
rituals administered by witch 
doctors who handed the for- 
mulas and techniques down 
from father to son. Maybe it’s 
like that here. Certainly these 
people give no evidence of an 
advanced civilization other 
than these trees and their na- 
tive intelligence. Civilized peo- 
ple don’t hunt with spears or 
live in tribal groups.” 

Barger nodded. “That’s a 
good point. Skipper.” 

“Well, there’s no sense 
speculating about it; maybe 
we’ll know if we wait and 
see,” Allardyce summed up.

I set sentries, three hours 
on and nine off, to keep Dan 
informed of our situation, and 
since rank has its privileges, 
I took the first watch. We were 
all tired from our walk 
through the woods ; the others 
turned in readily enough. I 
was sufficiently worried about 
the hints and implications in 
the native culture to keep alert 
— but nothing happened. I 
checked in with Dan back at 
the ship and went to awaken 
Alex, who had drawn the sec- 
ond watch, and turned in to 
the bedroom allotted to me. 
Normally I can sleep any- 
where, but I kept thinking 
about houses grown from trees 
and upholstery grown from 
fungus, about spear-carrying 
savages who understood the 
working principle of a men- 
ticom. 

It was all wrong and my 
facile explanation of a regress- 
ed cultui’e didn’t satisfy me. 
Superior technology and sav- 
agery simply didn’t go to- 
gether. Even in our Interreg- 
num Period, islands of culture 
and technology had remained, 
and men hadn’t reverted to 
complete savagery. But there 
were no such islands on this 
world — or none that were ap- 
parent. 

Such enclaves couldn’t have 
escaped our search mecha- 
nisms, which are designed 
precisely to locate such things. 
And besides, an advanced bi- 
ological technology would have 
no need for hunting or spears. 

CULTURAL EXCHANGE 



They could grow all the food 
they needed. Any damn fool 
knew that. Then why the noble 
savage act? For if our analysis 
was right, it must be an act. 
Why were they trying to hood- 
wink us ? The only answer was 
that there was a high civiliza- 
tion here that was being delib- 
erately hidden from us. The 
only mistake they had made 
was in underestimating us — 
the old story of civilized men 
sneering at savages, but in 
reverse. 

The trees, therefore, must 
be such old and primitive tech- 
niques that they thought noth- 
ing of them, deeming them so 
inconsequential that even sav- 
ages like us would know of 
them and not be suspicious. 
At that, they probably didn’t 
have too much time after they 
detected us orbiting and in- 
tending to land. And if that 
were true, there could be only 
one place where their civiliza- 
tion was hidden. 

1 TRIED to get to my feet, 
to warn the others — but I 
couldn’t move and no sound 
came from my flaccid vocal 
cords. I was paralyzed, help- 
less, and K’wan’s amused 
thought floated gently into my 
brain. “I told the others that 
you humans were an advanced 
race, but they couldn’t believe 
an obviously warlike species 
that depended upon machinery 
could be anything but savages. 
And your man Alex confirmed 
their beliefs. So we tried to 

123 




meet you on your own ground 
— savage to savage, as it were. 
It seems as though we weren’t 
as good at being savages as we 
thought.” And K’wan stepped 
through an apparently solid 
section of tree trunk that 
parted to let him pass ! 

This tree was nothing but a 
mousetrap, and we were the 
mice! Why hadn’t one of us 
carried the discussion a bit 
further? Any idiot should 
know that biological agents 
were fully as deadly as physi- 
cal ones. And these people 
were self-admittedly predato- 
ry. Contempt at my stupidity 
was the only emotion that fill- 
ed my mind — that we would 
be trapped like a flock of 
brainless sheep and led bleat- 
ing happily to slaughter. Raw 
anger surged through me, 
smothering my fear in a red 
blanket of rage. 

K’wan shook his head. 
“Your reaction works against 
you. It’s primitive — and, I 
think, dangerous. We cannot 
risk associating with a race 
that cannot control them- 
selves. You have developed too 
fast — too soon. We are an old 
race and a slow race, and our 
warlike days are far behind 
us. The council was right. 
Something must be done about 
you or there will be more of 
your kind on Lyrane — ^hard, 
driving, uncontrolled, violent.” 
He sighed — a very human 
sigh — half regret, half resig- 
nation. 

“And you promised no harm 

124 



would come to us if we came 
with you,” I thought bitterly. 

“I said you would come to 
no harm, nor will you. You’ll 
just be changed a little.” 

“Like Alex?” 

“Yes.” 

“What did you do to him?” 
He grinned, exposing his 
long tusks. “You’ll find out,” 
he said. He sounded just like 
a villain in a cheap melo- 
drama. 

He took the menticom cir- 
clet off my head and all com- 
munication stopped. Two oth- 
er Lyranians stepped through 
the wall, lifted me and carried 
me out like a shanghaied 
drunk from a spaceport bar. 
I wasn’t particularly sur- 
prised at the laboratory that 
lay behind the wall. After all, 
an observation cage had to 
have its laboratory facilities. 

These were good — very 
good indeed. Even though I 
knew hardly anything about 
biological laboratories, there 
was no doubt that here were 
the products of an advanced 
technology. I hated to admit 
it, but it looked as though we 
had run into what we had al- 
ways feared but had never 
found — a civilization superior 
to ours. From the windowless 
appearance of the place, it was 
probably underground, and 
K’wan’s look and nod seemed 
to confirm my guess. 

They laid me out on a table, 
took blood and tissue samples 
and proceeded to forget me 
while they ran tests and analy- 

J. F. BONE 




ses. I kept trying to move, but 
it wasn’t any use. 

A group of about a dozen 
oldsters came in, looked at me 
and went away. The council, 
1 guessed. 

In a surprisingly short time 
K’wan came back, distinguish- 
able by the menticom circlet. 
He was holding something 
that looked like a jet hypo in 
his hand. The barrel was full 
of a cloudy red liquid that 
swirled sluggishly behind the 
confining glass. 

“This won’t hurt,” he said, 
his thoughts amplified by the 
circlet. 

He lifted my arm, examined 
it and nodded. There was a 
high-pitched, sibilant hiss as 
he touched the trigger of the 
syringe and I felt a brief sting 
near my elbow. 

“There — that’s that!” he 
said. “Now we’ll take you back 
and get the others.” 

I swore at him coldly and 
viciously. 

He smiled. 

Alex helped lay me back on 
my bed in the tree house. He 
looked down at me and grin- 
ned. It wasn’t a pleasant grin. 
It reminded me of a crocodile. 

N aked, I was standing on 
an endless sandy plain. Off 
in the distance the Two Two 
Four stood on her landing 
jacks, a tall, needle-pointed 
tower of burnished silver 
metal. The sun beat down 
from a cobalt sky burning my 
bare back as I trudged pain- 

CULTURAL EXCHANGE 



fully across the hot shifting 
sand. My feet, scorched and 
blistered, sent agony racing 
through me with every step I 
took toward the tall silver col- 
umn that seemed to recede 
from me as fast as I ap- 
proached. My throat was 
choked with dust and my 
mind filled with fear and pain. 

I had to reach the ship. I 
had to. Yet I knew with dread- 
ful certainty that I would not. 

He came at me from a hol- 
low in the sandy ground, a 
huge, furry Lyranian — bigger 
than any I had seen. His white 
tusks glittered in the sunlight 
as he leaped at me. 

Twisting, I avoided him and 
turned to run. To fight that 
mountain of fanged flesh was 
futile. He could rip me apart 
with one hand. But I moved 
with viscid slowness, stum- 
bling through the shifting 
sands. 

In a moment he was upon 
me, clutching with his huge 
hands, snapping at my throat 
with his tusked mouth. Fear 
pumped adrenalin into my 
system and I fought as I had 
never fought before, break- 
ing his holds, throwing jar- 
ring punches into his fanged 
face as he clawed and bit at 
me. 

With a violent effort I broke 
away and ran again toward 
the safety of the distant ship. 
For a moment I left him be- 
hind as he scrambled to re- 
gain his feet and came run- 
ning after me. He was on me 

125 




again, hands reaching for my 
throat. I couldn’t get away. 
And again we fought, batter- 
ing and clawing at each other, 
using fists, feet and teeth, 
biting and gouging. His 
strength was terrible and his 
hot, fetid breath was rank in 
my nostrils. With a grunt of 
triumph he tripped me and I 
fell on my back on the blaz- 
ing sand. I screamed as my 
back struck the searing sur- 
face, but he held me helpless 
and immovable, pinned be- 
neath his massive, crushing 
weight. 

And then he began to eat 
me! 

I felt his sharp fangs sink 
into my shoulder muscles and 
meet in my flesh. With a rush 
of frantic strength I threw 
him off again and again, ran 
stumbling across the plain. 
Once more he caught me and 
again we fought. 

It went on endlessly — the 
fight, the temporary break- 
away, the flight, the pursuit, 
and the recapture. I wondered 
dully why no one on the ship 
had seen us. Perhaps they 
were looking in the wrong di- 
rection, or perhaps they 
weren’t even looking. If I sur- 
vived this and found that they 
hadn’t been on watch — I 
snarled and slammed my fist 
into the Lyranian’s face. 

Both of us were covered 
with blood, but he was visibly 
weaker. It was no longer a 
fight; we were too exhausted 
for that. We pawed at each 

126 



other feebly, and I could de- 
tect something oddly like fear 
in him now. He couldn’t hold 
me — ^but neither could I finish 
him. 

I gathered my last remain- 
ing strength into one last 
blow. My torn fist smashed 
into his bloody face. He top- 
pled to the ground and I fell 
beside him, too spent to move. 
I lay there panting, watching 
him. 

He rose to his hands and 
knees and came crawling to- 
ward me, trembling with 
weakness. I felt his smother- 
ing weight pinning me as he 
fell across me. He twisted 
slowly, his fanged mouth 
gaping to bite again. His 
jaws closed on my arm. I was 
done — beaten — too weary and 
bruised to care. He had won. 
But his teeth couldn’t break 
my skin. Like me, he was fin- 
ished. 

We lay there as the sun 
beat down, glaring at each 
other with fear and hate. And 
suddenly — over us — loomed 
the familiar faces of my crew 
and the tall tower of the Two 
Two Four. 

Somehow I had reached the 
ship and safety ! 

1 AWOKE. I was bathed 
with sweat. My muscles 
were aching and my head was 
a ball of fire. I looked around. 
Everything seemed normal. 
My menticom was on my head 
and I was lying on the bed in 
the tree house. Painfully I 



J. F. BONE 




rose to my feet and staggered 
into the main room. 

“My God ! Skipper, you look 
awful!” Allardyce’s voice was 
sharp with concern. “What’s 
wrong?” 

“I don’t know,” I muttered. 
“My head’s splitting.” 

“Here, sit down. Let me 
take a look at you.” Allardyce 
produced a thermometer and 
stuck it in my mouth. 
“Mmmm,” he said worriedly. 
“You’ve got fever.” 

“I feel like I’ve been 
through the mill,” I said. 

“We’d better get back to 
the ship. Doc should have a 
look at you.” 

I wanted nothing more than 
the familiar safety of the 
ship, away from these odd na- 
tives and exotic diseases that 
struck despite omnivaccina- 
tion. And we should get back 
before the others fell sick. 

“All right, Pat,” I said. 
“Contact Dan. Have him send 
the big ’copter. We’ll leave at 
once.” I discounted the expe- 
rience of last night as delir- 
ium, but just to make sure, I 
checked with Allardyce and 
Barger when they, came in. 

“Obviously fever,” Barger 
said. “Nothing happened to 
me like you describe.” 

“Nor to me,” Allardyce 
said. 

I nodded. They were right, 
of course, unless the Lyranian 
in their dreams had eaten and 
absorbed them. Then — but 
that was sheer nonsense. I 
was being a suspicious fool. 

CULTURAL EXCHANGE 



But that dream — all of it — 
had been damnably real. 

We made our excuses to 
K’wan as the ’copter fluttered 
down into a nearby clearing. 

“I’m sorry about this,” 
K’wan said apologetically, 
“but I never thought of the 
possibility of diseases. We are 
all immune. We do have some 
biological skill, as you’ve 
surely guessed, but our en- 
gineering technology is far in- 
ferior to yours. We thought 
it would be better not to let 
you know about us until we 
had a chance to observe you. 
But you undoubtedly have 
seen enough to deduce our 
culture.” He grinned — a fe- 
rocious grimace that exposed 
his long tusks. “I suppose we 
are rather bad liars. But then 
we’re not accustomed to de- 
ception.” 

“I understand,” I said. 
“You had no way of knowing 
what we were really like. We 
could have been the advance 
guard of a conquering space 
armada. You showed great 
courage to open relations with 
us.” 

“Not as great as yours. We 
had the opportunity of exam- 
ining your man Alex. You had 
only his untried opinions to 
go by.” 

The ’copter came down with 
a flutter of rotor blades, and 
I shook hands with K’wan. 
For a moment I was tempted 
to call Dan and tell him to 
turn our hostages loose, but 
on second thought decided 

127 




that could wait. I slipped my 
menticom off. There was no 
point in broadcasting my 
thoughts, and without the 
gadget KVan couldn't inter- 
cept them unless they were 
directed. After all, we were 
a minority on this world and 
Earth didn't even know where 
we were yet. A ship can cross 
hyper-space far more easily 
and quickly than the most 
powerful transmitter can 
broadcast across normal 
space. It would be a thousand 
years before Earth could hear 
from us by radio, even if they 
could distinguish our mes- 
sages from stellar interfer- 
ence. While I felt oddly 
friendly, there was no reason 
to take chances, especially if 
there was any truth in that 
dream. 

“You will be leaving soon?" 
K'wan asked. “You and the 
ship?” 

“Yes," I said. “We have 
done all we can do here." 

I looked up at him. He was 
standing there — holding the 
menticom in his hand — yet I 
understood him! 

I didn't let the astonish- 
ment show on my face, 
nor the shock that coursed 
through my mind when the 
Lyranian in my brain tried 
vainly to scream a waiming! 
Instead I took the circlet and 
turned to go. 

“Remember what you are 
to do; the others will help," 
K'wan said. 

“I will remember," I re- 



plied. You' re damn ivell right 
ril remember, 1 thought grim- 

ly. 

The Lyranian was supposed 
to wreck the ship. 

H e waved farewell as I 
turned to enter the ’cop- 
ter. “Our thoughts go with 
you for your success,” he said. 

The Lyranian in my brain 
screamed and struggled, but I 
held him easily. I was his mas- 
ter, not he mine. There would 
be no sabotage on the Two 
Two Four. He wouldn’t wreck 
my ship. 

“Dan,” I said as we went 
into orbit, “did Alex come 
aboard?” 

“Of course.” 

“Where is he?” 

“Down in the engine room, 
I suppose, or in his bunk. It’s 
not his watch.” 

“Maybe you’d better check. 
But before you do — ” 

He waited for me to con- 
tinue, and finally I was able 
to. 

“Put Allardyce, Barger, 
and myself in the brig,” I 
said. “Set a guard over us 
with instructions to shoot if 
we try to make a break. Then 
get Alex, if he’s aboard. 
Frankly, I don’t think you’ll 
find him. They didn’t need a 
ship’s commander, a sociolo- 
gist or a biologist, but they 
did need an engineer. Now get 
going. This is an order!” 
Warren stiffened. “Yes, 
sir — sorry, sir!” 

Inside my skull, the Lyran- 

J. F. BONE 



128 




ian came to life — struggled 
briefly — and then quit. Bar- 
ger, Allardyce and I spent the 
rest of the trip home in the 
air-conditioned, radiation-re- 
sistant, germproof, dustproof, 
escape-resistant brig. Alex, of 
course, wasn’t aboard. There 
aren’t many places on a star- 
ship where a man can hide, 
and the crew searched them 
all. 

Even so, I kept worrying 
about the ship’s safety all the 
way back. It was a miserable 
trip. I suppose it was just as 
miserable for the Lyranians in 
my two companions who kept 
worrying about how to de- 
stroy us. It didn’t do them any 
good either. They never got a 
chance, and ultimately we 
reached Decontamination. 

Barger and Allardyce are 
up there now. The medics 
think they can erase the Ly- 
ranians with insulin shock, 
but it’ll take time. Mine, be- 
ing a nice, tame one, was con- 
sidered to be more valuable in 
me than out. We’re going to 
have to know a lot about Ly- 
rane in a huriy if we’re going 
to do anything about those 
people, and my Lyranian can 
tell us plenty. 

But I’ll bet we’ll find things 
different on Lyrane when we 
go back. They’ll have at least 
ten years, and with the brains 
they’ve got — and Alex’s brain 
to pick— they’ll do just fine 
from an engineering point of 
view. I’ll bet they’ll even have 
spaceships. 

CULTURAL EXCHANGE 



From what I can gather 
from my alter ego, they 
checked Alex’s brain and 
didn’t like what they saw. 
That’s the trouble with ro- 
mantics. They always re- 
member the wars and the 
fighting, never the stodgy, 
peaceful interims. But you 
simply don’t spring that sort 
of stuff on a culture like Ly- 
rane’s. And I suppose my 
anger didn’t help things any, 
but if not for that anger and 
my primitive bull-headedness, 
we might not be here- 

III 

C APT. Halsey hurriedly 
downed the rum. “Skip- 
pers are picked because 
they’re tough-minded and au- 
thoritarian. In space you need 
it occasionally. Fortunately I 
lived up to specifications. A 
peaceful sort like my Lyran- 
ian just couldn’t take it — for- 
tunately.” 

“Fortunately?” I asked. 
“Sure. What else? Possibly 
those natives we conditioned 
would help our case, possibly 
not. And in the meantime the 
Lyranians would suck Alex 
dry. And with the Tivo Two 
Four gone it’d be maybe a 
couple of hundred years be- 
fore we ran into them again, 
and by then they’d really be 
ready — loaded for bear with 
itchy trigger fingers — and we 
just might have a war on our 
hands. As it is we’ll send out 
a battle fleet to give some au- 

129 




thority to our negotiators so 
no one will get hurt. They just 
shouldn't have picked Alex as 
typical of us. With his atti- 
tude and our weapons, they 
naturally got a lot of wrong 
ideas.” 

‘‘Wrong?” I prompted the 
skipper. 



Halsey chuckled. “Yes, 
that's what I said — wrong 
ideas,” he said in that remote 
second voice. “Just because 
you've forgotten self-defense 
doesn't mean that other peace- 
ful civilizations don't remem- 
ber it.” 

END 



Underwater Water Manipulators 

A vast area some 47 times larger than the United States exists on earth. 
Comparatively, it’s unused, unexplored. Economically, it’s vital to the 
continued development of this planet. Potentially, it’s accessible — much 
more so than anything in space. 

Yet, in reality its atmosphere turns to solid rock in the most important 
areas during parts of every year. And even where it remains fluid, the 
‘‘atmosphere” is as unbreathable as the moon’s vacuum; its gravity as 
light as Mars’; its pressure as heavy as Jupiter’s. 

It is, of course, the 140 million square miles of terrestrial real estate 
covered with water and ice. 

Underwater manipulation, like “planetary’^ engineering of science fic- 
tion, takes place in a completely alien environment and has problems 
unlike anything on earth. The question of keeping water liquid in sub- 
freezing winter at low cost is answered by these underwater manipulators. 
Year-around water commerce is part of the promise. 

Not only have underwater researchers found out how to keep water 
from freezing economically in 20 to 80 below zero weather, but also are 
developing new piers, aerators, wave control methods, propellers, under- 
water tools ... as reported by Industrial Research. Largely as a result 
of IGY explorations, scientists are looking to the seas to solve problems 
now becoming unsolvable on land or on the water’s surface: new sources 
of oil, manganese, cobalt, copper, gold, and other resources; water trans- 
lX)rtation impervious to storms; undetectable military installations; un- 
limited (by eicreage) farms for both crops and seastock. 

The potential is as vast as the imagination.
