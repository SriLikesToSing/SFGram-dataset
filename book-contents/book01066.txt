By THEODORE STURGEON 



Problem: the human race is complex; answer: 
put the problem in a nutshell — and this was 
the organization that could do exactly that! 



Illustrated by DILLON 



’LL bus 5 your face, Al,” said 
Gurlick. “I gon’ break your 
back. I gon’ blow up your 
place, an 5 you with it, an’ all your 
rotgut licker, who wants it? You 
hear me, Al?” 

Al didn’t hear him. Al was back 
of the bar in his place three blocks 
away, probably still indignantly 
red, still twitching his long bald 
head at the empty doorway 
through which Gurlick had fled, 
still repeating what all his cus- 
tomers had just witnessed : Gurlick 
cringing in from the slick raw 
night, fawning at Al, stretching his 
stubble in a ragged brown grin, 



tilting his head, half-closing his 
sick-green, muddy-whited eyes. 

“Walkin’ in here,” Al would be 
reporting for the fourth time in 
nine minutes, “all full of good-ol’- 
A1 this an’ hiya-buddy that, an’ 
you-know-me-Al, and how’s about 
a little you-know; an’ all I says is 
I know you all right, Gurlick, 
shuck on out o’ here, I wouldn’t 
give you sand if I met you on the 
beach; an’ him spittin’ like that, 
right on the bar, an’ runnin’ out, 
an’ stickin’ his head back in an’ 
callin’ me a — ” 

Sanctimoniously, Al would not 
sully his lips with the word. And

the rye-and-bitters by the door 
would be nodding wisely and say- 
ing, “Man shouldn’t mention a 
feller’s mother, whatever,” while 
the long-term beer would be clasp- 
ing his glass, warm as pablum and 
headless as Ann Boleyn, and in- 
toning, “You was right, Al, dead 
right.” 

Gurlick, four blocks away now, 
glanced back over his shoulder and 
saw no pursuit. He slowed his 
scamper to a trot and then a sog- 
gy shuffle, hunching his shoulders 
against the blowing mist. He kept 
on cursing Al, and the beer, and 
the rye-and-bitters, announcing 
that he could take ’em one at a 
time or all together one-handed. 

He could do nothing of the kind, 
of course. It wasn’t in him. It 
would have been success of a sort, 
and it was too late in life for Gur- 
lick, unassisted, to start anything 
as new and different as success. 
His very first breath had been ill- 
timed and poorly done, and from 
then on he had done nothing right. 
He begged badly and stole when 
it was absolutely safe, which was 
seldom, and he rolled drunks pro- 
viding they were totally blacked 
out, alone, and concealed. He slept 
in warehouses, boxcars, parked 
trucks. He worked only in the 
most extreme circumstances and 
had yet to last through the second 
week. 

“I’ll cut ’em,” he muttered. 
“Smash their face for them . .” 



TTE sidled into an alley and felt 
along the wall to a garbage 
can he knew about. It was a res- 
taurant garbage can and some- 
times . 

He lifted the lid and, as he did 
so, saw something pale slide away 
and fall to the ground. It looked 
like a bun, and he snatched at it 
and missed. He stooped for it, and 
part of the misted wall beside him 
seemed to detach itself and be- 
come solid and hairy; it scrabbled 
past his legs. He gasped and 
kicked out, a vicious, ratlike spasm. 

His foot connected solidly and 
the creature rose in the air and 
fell heavily at the base of the 
fence, in the dim wet light from 
the street. It was a small white 
dog, three-quarters starved. It 
yipped twice, faintly, tried to rise 
and could not. 

When Gurlick saw it was help- 
less, he laughed aloud and kicked it 
and stamped on it until it was 
dead, and with each blow his ven- 
geance became more mighty. 
There went Al, and there the two 
barflies, and one for the cops, and 
one for all judges and jailers, and 
a good one for everyone in the 
world who owned anything, and 
to top it, one for the rain. 

He was a pretty big man by 
the time he was finished. 

Out of breath, he wheezed back 
to the garbage can and felt around 
until he found the bun. It was 
sodden and slippery, but it was

half a hamburger which some 
profligate had left unfinished, and 
that was all that mattered. He 
wiped it on his sleeve, which made 
no appreciable difference to sleeve 
or bun, and crammed it into his 
mouth. 

He stepped out into the light 
and looked up through the mist 
at the square shoulders of the 
buildings that stood around to 
watch him. He was a man who 
had fought and killed for what 
was rightfully his. 

“Don’t mess with me,” he 
growled at the city. 

A kind of intoxication flooded 
him. He felt the way he did at the 
beginning of that dream he was 
always having, where he would 
walk down a dirt path beside a 
lake, feeling good, feeling strong 
and expectant, knowing he was 
about to come to the pile of clothes 
on the bank. He wasn’t having the 
dream just then, he knew; he was 
too cold and too wet, but he 
squared his shoulders anyway. He 
began to walk, looking up. He told 
the world to look out. He said he 
was going to shake it up and dump 
it and stamp on its fat face. 

“You gon’ to know Dan Gurlick 
passed this way,” he said. 

He was perfectly right this time, 
because it was in him now. 

TT had been in the hamburger 
and before that in the horse 
from which most of the hamburger 



had been made, and before that in 
two birds, one after the other, 
which had mistaken it for a berry. 
Before that . it’s hard to say. 

When the first bird ate it, it 
sensed it was in the wrong place, 
and did nothing, and the same 
thing with the second. When the 
horse’s blunt club of a tongue 
scooped it up with a clutch of 
meadow-grass, it had hopes for a 
while. It straightened itself out 
after the horse’s teeth flattened it, 
and left the digestive tract early, to 
shoulder its way between cells and 
fibers until it rested in a ganglion. 

There it sensed another disap- 
pointment, and high time too — 
once it penetrated into the neu- 
rone-chains, its nature would be 
irreversibly changed, and it would 
have been with the horse for the 
rest of his life. As, in fact, it was, 
but after the butcher’s blade missed 
it, and the meat-grinder wrung it, 
pinched it, stretched it (but in no 
way separated any part of it from 
any other), it could still go on 
about its job when the time came. 

Eight months in the deep-freeze 
affected it not at all, nor did hot 
fat. The boy who bit into the re- 
sulting hamburger was the only 
human being who ever saw it. It 
looked like a boiled raisin, or 
worse. The boy said so and got an- 
other free and it was dumped atop 
the garbage can, to be found and 
fought for by Gurlick. 

The rain came down hard. Gur-

lick’s exaltation faded, his shoul- 
ders hunched, his head went down. 
He slogged through the wet and 
soon sank to his usual level of 
feral misery. And there he stayed 
for a while. 

THHIS girl’s name was Charlotte 
Dunsay and she worked in Ac- 
counting. She was open and sunny 
and she was a dish. She had rich 
brown hair with ruby lights in it, 
and the kind of topaz eyes that 
usually belong to a special kind of 
blonde. She had a figure that Paul 
Sanders, who was in Pharmaceuti- 
cals, considered a waste when 
viewed in the light of the informa- 
tion that her husband was a Mer- 
chant Marine officer on the Aus- 
tralia run. It was a matter of hours 
after she caught the attention of 
the entire plant (which was a mat- 
ter of minutes after she got there) 
that news went around of her 
cheerful but unshakable “Thanks, 
but no, thanks.” 

Paul took this as an outright 
challenge, but he kept his distance 
and bided his time. When the 
water-cooler reported that her hus- 
band’s ship had come off second 
best in a bout with the Great Bar- 
rier Reef and had limped to Ho- 
bart, Tasmania, for repairs, Paul 
decided that the day was upon 
him. He stated as much in the 
locker room and got good odds — 
11 to 2 — and somebody to hold 
the money — one of the suckers 



who gave him the cue for the 
single strategic detail which so far 
had escaped him. 

He had the time (Saturday 
night), the place (obviously her 
apartment, since she wouldn’t go 
out), and the girl. All he had to fig- 
ure out was how to put himself on 
the scene, and when one of the 
suckers said, “Nobody gets into 
that place but a for-real husband 
or a sick kitten,” he had the an- 
swer. 

This girl had cried when one 
of the boss’s tropical fish was found 
belly-up one morning. She had 
rescued a praying mantis from an 
accountant who was flailing it 
against the window with the morn- 
ing Times, and after she let the 
little green monster out, she had 
rescued the accountant’s opinion of 
himself with a comforting word 
and a smile that put dazzle-spots 
all over his work for the rest of the 
afternoon. 

So on Saturday night, late 
enough so he would meet few peo- 
ple in the halls, but early enough 
so she wouldn’t be in bed yet, Paul 
Sanders stopped for a moment by 
a mirror in the hallway of her 
apartment house, regarded his 
rather startling appearance approv- 
ingly, winked at it, and then went 
to her door and began rapping soft- 
ly and excitedly. He heard soft 
hurrying footsteps behind the door 
and began to breathe noisily, like 
someone trying not to sob.

“Who is it? What’s the matter?” 

“Please,” he moaned against the 
panel, “please, please, Mrs. Dun- 
say, help me!” 

She immediately opened the 
door a peering inch. “Oh, thank 
God,” he breathed and pushed 
hard. She sprang back with her 
hands on her mouth and he slid 
in and closed the door with his 
back. She was ready for bed, as he 
had hardly dared to hope. The 
robe was a little on the sensible 
side, but what he could see of the 
gown was fine, just fine. 

He said hoarsely, “Don’t let 
them get me!” 

“Mr. Sanders!” Then she came 
closer, comforting, cheering. “No 
one’s going to get you. You come 
on in and sit down until it’s safe 
for you. Oh!” she gasped as he let 
his coat fall open, to reveal the 
shaggy rip and the bloodstain. 
“You’re hurt!” 

He gazed dully at the scarlet 
stain. Then he flung up his head 
and set his features in an approxi- 
mation of those of the Spartan boy 
who denied all knowledge of a 
stolen fox while the fox, hidden 
under his toga, ate his entrails. He 
pulled his coat straight and but- 
toned it and smiled and said, “Just 
a scratch.” Then he sagged, caught 
the doorknob behind him, straight- 
ened up, and again smiled. It was 
devastating. 

“Oh — oh, come and sit down,” 
she cried. 



TTE leaned heavily on her but 
kept his hands decent, and 
she got him to the sofa. She helped 
him off with his coat and his shirt. 
It was indeed only a scratch, and 
she didn’t seem to find the amount 
of blood too remarkable. A couple 
of cc swiped from the plasma lab 
goes a long way on a white sport 
shirt. 

He lay back limp and breathing 
shallowly while she flew to get 
scissors and bandages and warm 
water in a bowl, and averted his 
face from the light until she con- 
siderately turned it out in favor 
of a dim end-table lamp, and then 
he started the routine of not tell- 
ing her his story because he was 
not fit to be here . she shouldn’t 
know about such things . he’d 
been such a fool . and so on 
until she insisted that he could tell 
her anything, anything at all if 
it made him feel better. 

So he asked her to drink with 
him before he told her because 
she surely wouldn’t afterward, and 
she didn’t have anything but some 
sherry, and he said that was fine. 
He emptied a vial from his pocket 
into his drink and managed to 
switch glasses with her, and when 
she tasted it, she frowned slightly 
and looked down into the glass, 
but by then he was talking a sub- 
dued, dark blue, convoluted streak 
that she must strain to hear and 
puzzle to follow. 

In twenty minutes, he let it

dwindle away to silence. She said 
nothing, but sat with slightly 
glazed eyes on her glass, which she 
held with both hands like a child 
afraid of spilling. He took it away 
from her and set it on the end 
table and took her pulse. It was 
slower than normal and a good 
deal stronger. He looked at the 
glass. It wasn’t empty, but she’d 
had enough. He moved over close 
to her. 

“How do you feel?” 

She took seconds to answer, and 
then said slowly, “I feel . Her 
lips opened and closed twice, and 
she shook her head slightly and 
was silent, staring out at him from 
topaz eyes gone all black. 

“Charlotte . Lottie . lonely 
little Lottie. You’re lonesome. 
You’ve been so alone. You need 
me, li’l Lottie,” he crooned, watch- 
ing her carefully. 

When she did not move or 
speak, he took the sleeve of her 
robe in one hand and, moving 
steadily and slowly, tugged at it 
until her hand slipped inside. He 
untied the sash with his free hand 
and took her arm and drew it out 
of the robe. 

“You don’t need this now,” he 
murmured. “You are warm, so 
warm ...” He dropped the robe 
behind her and freed her other 
hand. She seemed not to under- 
stand what he was doing. The 
gown was nylon tricot. 

He drew her slowly into his 



arms. She raised her hands to his 
chest as if to push him away but 
there seemed to be no strength in 
them. Her head came forward un- 
til her cheek rested softly against 
his. She spoke into his ear quietly, 
without any particular force or ex- 
pression. 

“I mustn’t do this with you, 
Paul. Don’t let me. Harry is the 
. there’s never been anyone but 
him. There never must be. I’m . 
something’s happened to me. Help 
me, Paul. Help me. If I do it with 
you, I can’t live any more. I’m go- 
ing to have to die if you don’t help 
me now.” 

She didn’t accuse him in any 
way. 

Not once. 

HTHE carcass of the old truck 
stood forgotten in the never 
visited back edge of a junkyard. 
Gurlick didn’t visit it; he lived in 
it, more often than not. Sometimes 
the weather was too bitterly cold 
for it to serve him, and in the hot- 
test part of the summer he stayed 
away from it for weeks at a time. 
But most of the time it served 
him well. It broke the wind and it 
kept out most of the rain; it was 
dirty and dark and cost-free, which 
three items made it pure Gurlick. 

It was in this truck, two days 
after his encounter with the dog 
and the hamburger, that he was 
awakened from a deep sleep by 
. call it the Medusa.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He had not been having his 
dream of the pile of clothes by 
the bank of the pool, and of how 
he would sit by them and wait, and 
then of how she would appear out 
there in the water, splashing and 
humming and not knowing he was 
there. Yet. This morning there 
seemed not to be room in his head 
for the dream nor for anything 
else, including its usual contents. 

He made some grunts and a 
moan, and ground his stubby yel- 
low teeth together, and rolled up 
to a sitting position and tried to 
squeeze his pressured head back 
into shape from the outside. It 
didn’t help. He bent double and 
used his knees against his temples 
to squeeze even harder, and that 
didn’t help either. 

The head didn’t hurt, exactly. 
And it wasn’t what Gurlick occa- 
sionally called a “crazy” head. On 
the contrary, it seemed to contain 
a spacious, frigid and meticulous 
balance, a thing lying like a metri- 
cal lesion on the inner surface of 
his mind. 

He felt himself almost capable 
of looking at the thing, but, for 
all that it was in his head, it 
existed in a frightening direction, 
and at first he couldn’t bring him- 
self to look that way. 

T> UT then the thing began to 
spread and grow, and in a few 
rocking, groaning moments there 
wasn’t anything in his head but the 



new illumination, this opening 
casement which looked out upon 
two galaxies and part of a third, 
through the eyes and minds of 
countless billions of individuals, 
cultures, hives, gaggles, prides, 
bevies, braces, herds, races, flocks 
and other kinds and quantities of 
sets and groupings, complexes, sys- 
tems and pairings for which the 
language has as yet no terms; liv- 
ing in states liquid, solid, gaseous 
and a good many others with com- 
binations and permutations among 
and between; swimming, flying, 
crawling, burrowing, pelagic, root- 
ed, awash; and variously belegged, 
ciliated and bewinged; with con- 
sciousness which could be called 
the skulk-mind, the crash-mind, the 
paddle—, exaltation—, spring—, or 
murmuration-mind, and othe’ 
minds too numerous, too difficult, 
or too outrageous to mention. 

And, over all, the central con- 
sciousness of the creature itself 
(though ‘central’ is misleading; the 
hive-mind is permeative) — the 
Medusa, the galactic man o’ war, 
the superconscious of the illimit- 
able beast, of which the people of 
a planet were here a nerve and 
there an organ, where entire cul- 
tures were specialized ganglia; the 
creature of which Gurlick was now 
a member and a part, for all that 
he was a minor atom in a simple 
molecule of a primitive cell — 
this mighty consciousness became 
aware of Gurlick and he of it.

TTE let himself regard it just 
long enough to know it was 
there, and then blanked ten- 
elevenths of his mind away from 
the very idea. If you set before 
Gurlick a page of the writings of 
Immanuel Kant, he would see it; 
he might even be able to read a 
number of the words. But he 
wouldn’t spend any time or effort 
over it. He would see it and dis- 
card it from his attention, and if 
you left it in front of him, or held 
it there, he would see without look- 
ing and wait for it to go away. 

Now, in its seedings, the Medusa 
had dropped its wrinkled milt into 
many a fantastic fossa. And if one 
of those scattered spores survived 
at all, it survived in, and linked 
with, the person and the species 
in which it found itself. 

If the host-integer was a fish, 
then a fish it would remain, acting 
as a fish, thinking as a fish; and 
when it became a “person” (which 
is what biologists call the indi- 
vidual polyps which make up the 
incredible colonies we call hydro- 
medusae), it would not put away 
fishly things. On the contrary; it 
was to the interest of the Medusa 
that it keep its manifold parts spe- 
cialized in the media in which they 
had evolved; the fish not only re- 
mained a fish, but in many cases 
might become much more so. 

Therefore, in inducting Gurlick 
into itself, in the unequal interflow 
of itself into Gurlick and Gurlick 



into itself, he remained — just Gur- 
lick. 

What Gurlick saw of the Me- 
dusa’s environment(s), he would 
not look at. What the Medusa 
sensed was only what Gurlick 
could sense, and (regrettably for 
our pride of species) Gurlick him- 
self. It could not, as might be sup- 
posed, snatch out every particle 
of Gurlick’s information and ex- 
perience, nor could it observe Gur- 
lick’s world in any other way than 
through the man’s own eye and 
mind. Answers there might be, in 
that rotted repository, to the ques- 
tions the Medusa asked, but they 
were unavailable until Gurlick 
himself formulated them. 

This had always been a slow 
process with him. He thought ver- 
bally, and his constructions were 
put together at approximately oral 
speed. The end effect was extra- 
ordinary; the irresistible demands 
came arrowing into him from im- 
mensity, crossing light-years with 
considerably less difficulty than it 
found in traversing Gurlick’s thin, 
tough layer of subjective soft-focus, 
of not-caring, not-understanding- 
nor - wanting - to - understand. But 
reach him they did, the mighty 
unison of voice with which the 
super-creature conveyed ideas . 
and were answered in Gurlick’s 
own time, in his own way, and 
aloud in his own words. 

And so it was that this scrubby, 
greasy, rotten-toothed near-illiter-

okay. So whaddaya want?” 

URLICK was not afraid. In- 
credible as this might seem, it 
must be realized that he was now 
a member, a person of the crea- 
ture; part of it. He no more 
thought to fear it than a finger 
might fear a rib. But at the same 
time his essential Gurlickness was 
intact — or, as has been pointed 
out, possibly more so. So he knew 
that something he could not com- 
prehend wanted to do something 
through him of which he was in- 
capable, and would unquestionably 
berate him because it had not been 
done . 

But this was Gurlick! This kind 
of thing could hold no fears and 
no surprises for Gurlick. Bosses, 
cops, young drunks and barkeeps 
had done just this to Gurlick all 
his life! And “Okay, okay! So 
whaddaya want?” was his in- 
variable response, not only to a 
simple call, but also, and infuriat- 
ingly, to detailed orders. They had 
then to repeat their orders, or per- 
haps they would throw up their 
hands and walk away, or kick him 
and walk away. More often than 
not, the demand was disposed of, 
whatever it was, at this point, and 



that was worth a kick any time. 

The Medusa would not give up. 
Gurlick would not listen, and 
would not listen, and . had to 
listen, and took the easiest way 
out, and subsided to resentful 
seething — as always, as ever for 
him. It is doubtful that anyone 
else on Earth could have found 
himself so quickly at home with 
the invader. In this very moment 
of initial contact, he was aware of 
the old familiar response of any- 
one to a first encounter with him— 
a disgusted astonishment, a surge 
of unbelief, annoyance, and dawn- 
ing frustration. 

“So whaddaya want?” 

The Medusa told him what it 
wanted, incredulously, as one ex- 
plaining the utter and absolute 
obvious, and drew a blank from 
Gurlick. There was a moment of 
disbelief and then a forceful repeti- 
tion of the demand. 

And Gurlick still did not under- 
stand. Few humans would, for not 
many have made the effort to com- 
prehend the nature of the hive- 
mind — what it must be like to 
have such a mind, and further, to 
be totally ignorant of the fact that 
any other kind of mind could 
exist. 

For in all its eons of being, 
across and back and through and 
through the immensities of space 
it occupied, the Medusa had never 
encountered intelligence except as 
a phenomenon of the group. It was 



TO MARRY MEDUSA

aware of the almost infinite varia- 
tions in kind and quality of the 
gestalt psyche, but so fused in its 
experience and comprehension 
were the concepts “intelligence” 
and “group” that it was genuinely 
incapable of regarding them as 
separable things. That a single en- 
tity of any species was capable of 
so much as lucid thought without 
the operation of group mechanisms 
was outside its experience and be- 
yond its otherwise near-omnis- 
cience. To contact any individual 
of a species was— or had been until 
now — to contact the entire spe- 
cies. 

]VT OW it pressed against Gurlick, 
■*- ’ changed its angle and pressed 
again, paused to ponder, came 
back again and, puzzling, yet again 
to do the exploratory, bewildered 
things a man might do, faced with 
the opening of and penetration 
through some artifact he did not 
understand. 

There were tappings and listen- 
ings, and (analogously) pressures 
this way and that, as if to find a 
left-hand thread. There were scrap- 
ings as for samples to analyze, 
proddings and pricks as for hard- 
ness tests, polarized rayings as if 
to determine lattice structures. And 
in the end there was a — call it a 
pressure test, the procedure one ap- 
plies to clogged tubing or to oxide- 
shorts on shielded wire: blow it 
out. Take what’s supposed to be 



going through and cram an excess 
down it 

Gurlick sat on the floor of the 
abandoned truck, disinterestedly 
aware of the distant cerebration, 
computation, discussion and con- 
jecture. A lot of gabble by some- 
one who knew more than he did 
about things he didn’t understand. 
Like always. 

Uh! 

It had been a thing without 
sight or sound or touch, but it 
struck like all three, suffused him 
for a moment with some unbear- 
able tension, and then receded and 
left him limp and shaken. Some 
mighty generator somewhere had 
shunted in and poured its product 
to him, and it did a great many 
things inside him somehow; and 
all of them hurt, and none was 
what was wanted. 

He was simply not the right con- 
duit for such a force. He was a 
solid bar fitted into a plumbing 
system, a jet of air tied into an 
electrical circuit; he was the wrong 
material in the wrong place and 
the output end wasn’t hooked up 
to anything at all. 

Spectacular, the degree of mys- 
tification which now suffused the 
Medusa. For ages untold, there had 
always been some segment some- 
where which could come up with 
an answer to anything; now there 
was not. 

That particular jolt of that par- 
ticular force ought to have ex- 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ploded into the psyche of every 
rational being on Earth, forming 
a network of intangible, unbreak- 
able threads leading to Gurlick and 
through him to Medusa itself. It 
had always happened that way — 
not almost always, but always. This 
was how the creature expanded. 
Not by campaign, attack, siege, 
consolidation, conquest, but by con- 
tact and influx. Its “spores,” if they 
encountered any life-form which 
the Medusa could not control, 
simply did not function. If they 
functioned, the Medusa flowed in. 
Always. 

From methane swamp to air- 
less rock, from sun to sun through 
two galaxies and part of a third 
flickered the messages, sorting, 
combining, test-hypothesizing, cal- 
culating, extrapolating. And these 
flickerings began to take on the 
hue of fear. The Medusa had never 
known fear before. 

' | ’O be thus checked meant that 
the irresistible force was re- 
sisted, the indefensible was 
guarded. Earth had a shield, and 
a shield is the very next thing to 
a weapon. It was a weapon, in 
the Medusa’s lexicon; for expan- 
sion was a factor as basic to its 
existence as Deity to the religious, 
as breath or heartbeat to a single 
animal; such a factor may not, 
must not be checked. 

Earth suddenly became a good 
deal more than just another berry 



for the mammoth to sweep in. Hu- 
manity now had to be absorbed, 
by every measure of principle, of 
gross ethic, of life. 

And it must be done through 
Gurlick, for the action of the 
“spore” within him was irrevers- 
ible, and no other human could be 
affected by it. The chances of an- 
other being in the same sector at 
the same time were too remote to 
justify waiting, and Earth was 
physically too remote from the 
nearest Medusa-dominated planet 
to allow for an attack in force or 
even an exploratory expedition, 
whereby expert mind might put 
expert hands (or palps or claws 
or tentacles or cilia or mandibles) 
to work in the field. 

No, it had to be done through 
Gurlick, who might be — must be 
— manipulated by thought emana- 
tions, which are non-physical and 
thereby exempt from physical laws, 
capable of skipping across a galaxy 
and back before a light-ray can 
travel a hundred yards. 

Even while, after that blast of 
force, Gurlick slumped and scrab- 
bled dazedly after his staggering 
consciousness, and as he slowly 
rolled over and got to his knees, 
grunting and pressing his head, the 
Medusa was making a thousand 
simultaneous computations and set- 
ting up ten thousand more. From 
the considerations of a space-trav- 
eling culture deep in the Coal- 
sack Nebula came a thought in the 



TO MARRY MEDUSA 



15 



form of a speculative analogy: 

As a defense against thick con- 
centrations of cosmic dust, these 
creatures had designed spaceships 
which, on approaching a cloud, 
broke up into hundreds of small 
streamlined parts which would 
come together and reunite when 
the danger was past. Could that be 
what humanity had done? Had 
they a built-in mechanism, like the 
chipmunk’s tail, the sea-cucumber’s 
ejectible intestines, which would 
fragment the hive-mind on contact 
from outside, break it up into two 
and a half billion specimens like 
this Gurlick? 

It seemed reasonable. In its iso- 
lation as the only logical hypoth- 
esis conceivable by the Medusa, it 
seemed so reasonable as to be a 
certainty. 

How could it be undone then 
and humanity’s total mind re- 
stored? Therein lay the Medusa’s 
answer. Unify humanity (it 
thought: re-unify humanity) and 
the only problem left would be 
that of influx. If that influx could 
not be done through Gurlick di- 
rectly, other ways might be found; 
it had never met a hive-mind yet 
that it couldn’t enter. 

Gasping, Gurlick grated, “Try 
that again, you gon’ kill me, you 
hear?” 

i^OLDLY examining what it 
^ could of the mists of his mind, 
the Medusa weighed that state- 



ment and doubted it. On the other 
hand, Gurlick was, at the moment, 
infinitely valuable. It now knew 
that he could be hurt, and organ- 
isms which can be hurt can be 
driven. It realized also that Gur- 
lick might be more useful, how- 
ever, if he could be enlisted. 

To enlist an organism, you find 
out what it wants and give it a 
little in a way that indicates 
promise of more. It asked Gurlick 
then what he wanted. 

“Lea’me alone,” Gurlick said. 

The response to that was a flat 
negative, with a faint stirring of 
that wrenching, explosive force it 
had already used. Gurlick whim- 
pered, and the Medusa asked him 
again. 

“What do I want?” whispered 
Gurlick. He ceased, for the mo- 
ment, to use words, but the con- 
cepts were there. They were hate 
and smashed faces, and the taste 
of liquor, and a pile of clothes by 
the bank of a pond: she saw him 
sitting there and was startled; then 
she smiled and said, Hello, Hand- 
some. What did he want? . 

The Medusa at this point had 
some considerable trouble inter- 
rupting. Gurlick, on the subject of 
what Gurlick wanted, could go on 
with surprising force for a very 
long time. The Medusa found it 
possible to understand this resent- 
ment, surely the tropistic flailing 
of something amputated, something 
denied full function, robbed, de-

prived. And, of course, insane. 

Deftly, the Medusa began mak- 
ing promises. The rewards were 
described vividly indeed, and in 
detail that enchanted Gurlick. 
They were subtly implanted feed- 
back circuits from his own imagin- 
ings and they dazzled him. And 
from time to time there was a 
faint prod from that which had 
hurt him, just to remind him that 
it was still there. 

At last, “Oh, sure, sure,” Gur- 
lick said. *TU find out about that, 
about how people can get put to- 
gether again. An’ then, boy, I gon’ 
step on their face.” 

So it was, chuckling, that Daniel 
Gurlick went forth from his 
wrecked truck to conquer the 
world. 

"TklMITY Carmichael sat back 
and smiled at the weeping 
girl. “Sex,” she told Caroline, “is, 
after all, so unnecessary.” 

Caroline knelt on the rug with 
her face hidden in the couch cush- 
ion, her nape bright red from 
weeping, the end strands of her 
hair wet with tears. 

She had come unexpectedly, in 
mid-afternoon, and Dimity Car- 
michael had opened the door and 
almost screamed. She had caught 
the girl before she could fall, led 
her to the couch. When Caroline 
could speak, she muttered about a 
dentist, about how it had hurt, how 
she had been so sure she could 



make it home but was just too 
sick, and, finding herself here, had 
hoped Dimity would let her lie 
down for a few minutes . 

Dimity had made her comfort- 
able and then, with a few sharp 
unanswerable questions (“What 
dentist? What is his name? Why 
couldn’t you lie down in his of- 
fice? He wanted you out of there 
as soon as he’d finished, didn’t he? 
In fact, he wasn’t a dentist and he 
didn’t do the kind of operations 
dentists do, isn’t that so?”) she 
had reduced the pale girl to this 
sodden, sobbing thing huddled 
against the couch. “I’ve known for 
a long time how you were carry- 
ing on. And you finally got caught.” 
It was at that point, after think- 
ing it out in grim, self-satisfied si- 
lence, that Dimity Carmichael said 
sex was, after all, so unnecessary. 
“It certainly has done you no 
good. Why did you give in, Carol- 
ine? You didn’t have to.” 

“I did, I did ... ” 

“Nonsense. Say you wanted to 
and we’d be closer to the truth. 
No one has to.” 

Caroline said something — “I 
love (or loved) him so,” or some 
such. Dimity sniffed. “Love, Carol- 
ine, isn’t that. Love is everything 
else there can be between a man 
and a woman, without that.” 
Caroline sobbed. 

“That’s your test, you see,” ex- 
plained Dimity Carmichael. “We 
are human beings because there 



TO MARRY MEDUSA 



17 



are communions between us which 
are not experienced by — by rab- 
bits, we’ll say. If a man is willing 
to make some great sacrifice for 
a woman, it might be a proof of 
love. Considerateness, chivalry, 
kindness, patience, the sharing of 
great books and fine music — these 
are the things that prove a man. 
It is hardly a demonstration of 
manhood for a man to prove him- 
self merely as capable as a rabbit” 

Caroline shuddered. Dimity Car- 
michael smiled tightly. Caroline 
spoke. 

“What? What’s that?” 

Caroline turned her cheek to 
rest it in her clenching hand. Her 
eyes were squeezed closed. “I said 
. I just can’t see it the way you 
do. I can’t.” 

“You’d be a lot happier if you 
did.” 

“I know, I know . .” Caroline 
sobbed. 

Dimity Carmichael leaned for- 
ward. “You can, if you like. Even 
after the kind of life you’ve lived 
— oh, I know how you were play- 
ing with the boys from the time 
you were twelve years old — but 
that can all be wiped away, and 
this will never bother you again. 
If you’ll let me help you.” 

/'CAROLINE shook her head ex- 
^ haustedly. It was not a re- 
fusal, but instead doubt, despair. 

“Of course I can,” said Dimity, 
as if Caroline had spoken her 



doubts aloud. “You just do as I 
say.” 

She waited until the girl’s shoul- 
ders were still, until she lifted her 
head away from the couch, turned 
to sit on her calves, looked side- 
wise up at Dimity from the cor- 
ners of her long eyes. “Do what?” 
Caroline asked forlornly. 

“Tell me what happened — 
everything.” 

“You know what happened.” 
“You don’t understand. I don’t 
mean this afternoon — that was a 
consequence and we needn’t dwell 
on it. I want the cause. I want to 
know exactly what happened to 
get you into this.” 

“I won’t tell you his name.” 

“His name,” said Dimity Car- 
michael, “is legion. I don’t care 
about that. What I want you to 
do is to describe to me exactly 
what happened, in every last de- 
tail, to bring you to this,” and she 
waved a hand at the girl, and her 
“dentist,” and all the parts of her 
predicament. 

“Oh,” said Caroline faintly. Sud- 
denly she blushed. “I— I can’t be 
sure just wh-which time it was.” 
“That doesn’t matter either,” 
said Dimity flatly. “Pick your own. 
For example, the first time with 
this latest one. All right? Now tell 
me what happened — every last 
little detail, from second to second.” 
Caroline turned her face into 
the upholstery again. “Oh . 
why?” 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You’ll see.” She waited for a 
time, and then said, “Well?” and 
again, “Look, Caroline, we’ll peel 
away the sentiment, the bad judg- 
ment, the illusions and delusions, 
and leave you free. As I am free. 
You will see for yourself what it 
is to be that free.” 

Caroline closed her eyes, making 
two red welts where the lids met. 
“I don’t know where to begin . .” 
“At the beginning. You had been 
somewhere — a dance, a club?” 
“A ... a drive-in.” 

“And then he took you—” 
“Home. His house.” 

“Go on.” 

“We got there and had another 
drink and — it happened, that’s 
all.” 

“What happened?” 

“Oh, I can’t, I can’t talk about 
it! Don’t you see?” 

“I don’t see. This is an emer- 
gency, Caroline. You do as I tell 
you. Just talk.” She paused and 
then said quietly, “You got to his 
house.” 

1 1 ''HE girl looked up at her with 
one searching, pleading look, 
and, staring down at her hands, 
began speaking rapidly. Dimity 
Carmichael bent close to listen, 
and let her go on for a minute, 
then stopped her. “You have to 
say exactly how it was. Now — 
this was in the parlor.” 

“L-living room.” 

“Living room. You have to see 



it all again — drapes, pictures, 
everything. The sofa was in front 
of the fireplace, is that right?” 
Caroline haltingly described the 
room, with Dimity repeating, ex- 
panding, insisting. Sofa here, fire- 
place there, table with drinks, win- 
dow, door, easy chair. How warm, 
how large, what do you mean red, 
what red were the drapes? “Begin 
again so I can see it.” 

More swift, soft speech, more 
interruption. “You wore what?” 
“The black faille with the vel- 
vet trim and that neckline, you 
know—” 

“Which has the zipper—” 

“In the back.” 

“Go on.” 

After a time, Dimity stopped 
her with a hand on her back. “Get 
up off the floor. I can’t hear you. 
Get up, girl.” Caroline rose and sat 
on the couch. “No, no; lie down. 
Lie down,” Dimity whispered. 

Caroline lay down and put her 
forearms across her eyes. It took 
a while to get started again, but at 
last she did. Dimity drew up an 
ottoman and sat on it, close, watch- 
ing the girl’s mouth. 

“Don’t say it,” she said at one 
point. “There are names for these 
things. Use them.” 

“Oh, I — just couldn’t.” 

“Use them.” 

Caroline used them. 

“But what were you feeling all 
this time?” 

“F-feeling?” 



TO MA&RY MEDUSA 



19 



“Exactly.” 

Caroline tried. 

“And did you say anything while 
this was going on?” 

“No, nothing. Except—” 

“Well?” 

“Just at first,” whispered the 
girl. She moved and was still again, 
and her concealing arms clamped 
visibly tighter against her eyes. 
“I think I went . and her teeth 
met, her lips curled back, her 
breath hissed in sharply. 

¥~\IMITY Carmichael’s lips 
U curled back and she clenched 
her teeth and sharply drew in her 
breath. “Like that?” 

“Yes.” 

“Go on. Did he say anything?” 

“No. Yes. Yes, he said, ‘Caroline, 
Caroline, Caroline,’” she crooned. 

“Go on.” 

She went on. Dimity listened, 
watching. She saw the girl smiling 
and the tears that pressed out 
through the juncture of forearm 
and cheek. She watched the faint 
flickering of white-edged nostrils. 
She watched the breast in its rapid 
motion, not quite like that which 
would result from running up 
stairs, because of the shallow shiver 
each long inhalation carried, the 
second’s catch and hold, the gasp- 
ing release. 

“Ah-h-h-h-h!” Caroline screamed 
suddenly, softly. “Ahh ... I thought 
he loved me! I did think he loved 
me!” She wept. “That’s all . 



“No, it isn’t. You had to leave, 
get ready to leave. Hm? What did 
he say? What did you say?” 
Finally, when Caroline said, 
. and that’s all,” there were no 
questions to ask. Dimity Car- 
michael rose and picked up the ot- 
toman and placed it carefully 
where it belonged by the easy 
chair, and sat down. The girl had 
not moved. 

“Now how do you feel?” 

Slowly the girl took down her 
arms and lay looking at the ceiling. 
She wet her lips and let her head 
fall to the side so she could look 
at Dimity Carmichael, composed 
in the easy chair — a chair not too 
easy, but comfortable for one who 
liked a flat seat and a straight back. 
The girl searched Dimity Car- 
michael’s face, looking apparently 
for shock, confusion, anger, dis- 
gust. She found none of these, 
nothing but thin lips, dry skin, cool 
eyes. 

Answering at last, she said, “I 
feel . awful.” She waited, but 
Dimity Carmichael had nothing to 
say. She sat up painfully and cov- 
ered her face with her hands. She 
said, “Telling it was making it 
happen all over again, almost real. 
But-” 

Again a silence. 

“—but it was like . doing it 
in front of somebody else. In front 
of-” 

“In front of me?” 

“Yes, but not exactly.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You did do it in front of some- 
one — yourself. You will never be 
in such a situation again,” Dimity 
Carmichael intoned, her voice re- 
turning and returning to the same 
note like some soft insistent buz- 
zer, “without hearing yourself tell 
it, every detail, every sight and 
sound of it, to someone else. Ex- 
cept that the happening and the 
telling won’t be weeks apart, like 
this time. They’ll be simultaneous.” 
“But the telling makes it all 
so . cheap, almost . funny!” 
“It isn’t the telling that makes 
it that way. The act is itself ridicu- 
lous, ungraceful, altogether too 
trivial for the terrible price one 
pays for it Now you can see it 
as I see it; now you will be un- 
able to see it any other way. Go 
wash your face.” 

S HE did, and came back look- 
ing much better, with her hair 
combed and the furrows gone from 
her brows and the comers of her 
long eyes. With the last of her 
makeup gone, she looked even 
younger than usual; to think she 
was actually two years older than 
Dimity Carmichael was incredible, 
incredible . 

She slipped on her jacket and 
took up her topcoat and handbag. 
“I’m going. I — feel a lot better. 
I mean about . things.” 

“It’s just that you’re beginning 
to feel as I do about . things.” 
“Oh!” Caroline cried from the 



door, from the depths of her 
troubles, her physical and mental 
agonies, the hopeless complexity of 
simply trying to live through what 
life presented. “Oh, I wish I was 
like you! I wish I’d always been 
like you!” And she went out. 

Dimity Carmichael sat for a 
long time in the not-quite-easy 
chair with her eyes closed. Then 
she rose and went into the bed- 
room and began to take off her 
clothes. She needed a bath; she 
felt proud. She had a sudden recol- 
lection of her father’s face showing 
a pride like this. He had gone 
down into the cesspool to remove 
a blockage when nobody else 
would do it. It had made him quite 
sick, but when he came up, un- 
speakably filthy and every nerve 
screaming for a scalding bath, it 
had been with that kind of pride. 

Mama had not understood that 
nor liked it She would have borne 
the unmentionable discomforts of 
the blocked sewer indefinitely 
rather than have it known even 
within the family that Daddy had 
been so soiled. Well, that’s the way 
Daddy was. That’s the way Mama 
was. The episode somehow crys- 
tallized the great difference be- 
tween them, and why Mama had 
been so glad when he died, and 
how it was that Dimity’s given 
name — given by him — was one 
which reflected all the luminance 
of wickedness and sin, and why 
Salome Carmichael came to be

known as Dimity from the day he 
died. No cesspools for her. Clean, 
crisp was little Dimity, decent, 
pleated, skirted and cozy all her 
life. 

To get from her bedroom into 
the adjoining bath — seven steps 
— she bundled up in the long robe. 
Once the shower was adjusted to 
her liking, she hung up the robe 
and stepped under the cleansing 
flood. She kept her gaze, like her 
thoughts, directed upward as she 
soaped. 

T HE detailed revelation she had 
extracted from Caroline flashed 
through her mind, all of it, in a 
second, but with no detail missing. 
She smiled at the whole disgusting 
affair with a cool detachment. In 
the glass door of the shower stall, 
scattering of hairs, the strong 
square clean yellow teeth, 
she saw the ghost-reflection of her 
face, the coarse-fleshed, broad nose, 
the heavy chin with its random 
I wish I was like you! I wish 
I’d always been like you! Caroline 
had said that, slim-waisted, full- 
breasted Caroline, Caroline with 
the mouth which, in relaxation, 
pouted to kiss me, Caroline with 
the skin of a peach, whose eyes 
were long jewels of a rare cut, 
whose hair was fine and glossy and 
inwardly ember-radiant. I wish I 
was like you . 

Could Caroline have known that 
Dimity Carmichael had yearned 



all her life for those words spoken 
that way by Caroline’s kind of 
woman? For were they not the 
words Dimity herself repressed as 
she turned the pages of magazines, 
watched the phantoms on the 
stereophonic, technicolored, wide 
deep unbearable screen? 

It was time now for the best 
part of the shower, the part Dimity 
looked forward to most. She put 
her hand on the control and let 
it rest there, ecstatically delaying 
the transcendant moment 

... be like you . perhaps 
Caroline would, one day, with luck. 
How good not to need all that, how 
fine and clear everything was with- 
out it! How laughingly revolting, 
to have a man prove the power of 
a rabbit’s preoccupations with his 
animal stragglings and his breathy 
croonings of one’s name, “Salome, 
Salome, Salome ...” (I mean, she 
corrected herself suddenly and 
with a shade of panic, Caroline, 
Caroline, Caroline.) 

In part because it was time, and 
part because of a swift suspicion 
that her thoughts were gaining a

Carmichael turned back, the teeth 
met, the breath was drawn in with 
a sharp, explosive hiss. 

i^URLICK sank his chin into 
his collarbones, hunched his 
shoulders, and shuffled. “I’ll find 
out,” he promised, muttering. “You 
jus’ let me know what you want, 
I’ll find out fya. Then, boy, look 
out.” 

At the corner, sprawled out on 
the steps of an abandoned candy 
store, he encountered what at first 
glance seemed to be an odorous 
bundle of rags. He was about to 
pass it when he stopped. Or was 
stopped. 

“It’s on’y Freddy,” he said dis- 
gustedly. “He don’t know nothin’ 
hardly.” 

“Gah dime bo?” asked the 
bundle, stirring feebly, and extend- 
ing a filthy hand which flowered 
on the stem of an impossibly thin 
wrist. 

“Well, sure I said somebody 
oughta know,” growled Gurlick, 
“but not him, f’godsakes.” 

“Gha dime bo? Oh . It’s Dan- 
ny. Got a dime on ya, Danny?” 

“All right, all right, I’ll ast ’im!” 
said Gurlick angrily, and at last 
turned to Freddy. “Shut up, Fred- 
dy. You know I ain’t got no dime. 
Listen, I wanna ast you somethin.’ 
How could we get all put together 
again?” 

Freddy made an effort which 
he had apparently not considered 



worth while until now: he focused 
his eyes. “Who — you and me? 
What you mean, put together?” 

“I tole you!” said Gurlick, not 
speaking to Freddy; then, at the 
mingled presssure of threat and 
promise, he whimpered in exasper- 
ation and said, “Just tell me can 
we do it or not, Freddy.” 

“What’s the matter with you, 
Danny?” 

“You gon’ tell me or aincha?” 
Freddy blinked palely and 
seemed on the verge of making a 
mental effort. Finally he said, “I’m 
cold. I been cold for three years. 
You got a drink on you, Danny?” 
There wasn’t anybody around, 
so Gurlick kicked him. “Jerk,” he 
said, tucked his chin down, and 
shuffled away. Freddy watched 
him for a while, until his gritty 
lids got too heavy to hold up. 

Two blocks further, Gurlick saw 
somebody else and tried to cross 
the street. He was not permitted 
to. “No!” he begged. “No, no, no! 
You can’t ast every single one you 
see.” Whatever he was told, it was 
said in no uncertain terms, be- 
cause he whined, “You gon’ get 
me in big trouble, jus’ you wait.” 
Ask he must; ask he did. The 
plumber’s wife, who stood a head 
taller than he and weighed twice 
as much, stopped sweeping her 
stone steps as he shuffled toward 
her, head still down but eyes up, 
and obviously not going to scuttle 
past as his kind usually did.

He stopped before her, looking 
up. She would tower over him if 
he stood on a box; as it was, he 
was on the sidewalk and she on 
the second step. He regarded her 
like a country cousin examining a 
monument. She looked down at 
him with the nauseated avidity of 
a witness to an automobile acci- 
dent. 

He put a hand on the side of his 
head and screwed up his eyes. The 
hand fell away; he gazed at her 
and croaked, “How can we get 
put together again?” 

It seemed a long noisy while 
before the immense capacity of 
her lungs was exhausted by her 
first great ring of laughter, but 
when it was over, it brought her 
face down again, which served 
only to grant her another glimpse 
of Gurlick’s anxious filthy face, 
and caused another paroxysm. 

¥TE left her laughing and headed 
for the park. Numbly he 
cursed the woman and all women, 
and all their husbands, and all 
their forebears and descendants. 

Into the park the young spring 
had brought slim grass, treebuds, 
dogs, children, old people and a 
hopeful ice-cream vendor. The 
peace of these beings was leavened 
by a scattering of adolescents who 
had found the park on such a day 
more attractive than school, and it 
was three of these who swarmed 
into Gurlick’s irresolution as he 



stood just inside the park, trying 
to find an easy way to still the de- 
mand inside his head. 

“Dig the creep,” said the one 
with heroes on the back of his 
jacket, and another: “Or -bit!” and 
the three began to circle Gurlick, 
capering like stage Indians, hold- 
ing fingers out from their heads 
and shrilling “Bee-beep! Bee-beep” 
satellite signals. 

Gurlick turned back and forth 
for a moment like a weathervane 
in a williwaw, trying to sort them 
out. “Giddada year,” he growled. 

“Bee-beep!” screamed one of the 
satellites. “Stand by fer r e-yentry!” 
The capering became a gallop as 
the orbits closed, swirled around 
him in a shouting blur, and at the 
signal “Burnout!” they stopped ab- 
ruptly and the one behind Gurlick 
dropped to his hands and knees 
while the other two pushed. Gur- 
lick hit the ground with a whoosh, 
flat on his back with his arms and 
legs in the air. Around the scene, 
one woman cried out indignantly, 
one old man’s mouth popped open 
with shock, and everyone else, 
everyone else, laughed and 
laughed. 

“Giddada year,” gasped Gurlick, 
trying to roll over and get his 
knees under him. 

One of the boys solicitously 
helped him to his feet, saying to 
another, “Now, Rocky, ya shoonta. 
Ya shoonta.” When the trembling 
Gurlick was upright and the sec-

ond of the trio — the “Hero” — 
down on hands and knees behind 
him again, the solicitous one gave 
another push and down went Gur- 
lick again. Gurlick, now dropping 
his muffled pretenses of threat and 
counterattack, lay whimpering 
without trying to rise. Everybody 
laughed and laughed, all but two, 
and they didn’t do anything. Ex- 
cept move closer, which attracted 
more laughers. 

“Space Patrol! Space Patrol,” 
yelled Rocky, pointing at the ap- 
proaching blue uniform. “Four 
o’clock high!” 

“Ess-cape velocity!” one of them 
barked; and with their antenna- 
fingers clamped to their heads and 
a chorus of shrill bee-beeps, they 
snaked through the crowd and 
were gone. 

“Bastits. Lousy bastits. I’ll kill- 
urn, the lousy bastits,” Gurlick 
wept. 

“Ah right. Ah right! Break it up. 
Move along. Ah right,” said the 
policeman. The crowd broke it up 
immediately ahead of him and 
moved along sufficiently to close 
the gap behind, craning in gap- 
mouthed anticipation of another 
laugh . laughter makes folks feel 
good. 

The policeman found Gurlick 
on all fours and jerked him to his 
feet, a good deal more roughly 
than Rocky had done. “Ah right, 
you, what’s the matter with you?” 

The indignant lady pushed 



through and said something about 
hoodlums. “Oh,” said the police- 
man, “hoodlum, are ye?” 

“Lousy bastits,” Gurlick sobbed. 
The policeman quelled the in- 
dignant lady in mid-protest with 
a bland, “Ah right, don’t get ex- 
cited, lady; I’ll handle this. What 
you got to say about it?” he de- 
manded of Gurlick. 

G URLICK, half suspended from 
the policeman’s hard fist, 
whimpered and put his hands to 
his head. Suddenly nothing around 
him, no sound, no face, pressed 
upon him more than that insistence 
inside. “I don’t care there is lotsa 
people, don’t make me ast now!” 
“What’d you say?” demanded 
the policeman truculently. 

“Okay, okay!” Gurlick cried to 
the Medusa, and to the policeman: 
“All I want is, tell me how we 
c’n get put together again.” 
"What?” 

“All of us,” said Gurlick. “Every- 
body in the world.” 

“He’s talking about world 
peace,” said the indignant woman. 
There was laughter. Someone ex- 
plained to someone else that the 
bum was afraid of the Commu- 
nists. Someone else heard that and 
explained to the man behind him 
that Gurlick was a Communist. 
The policeman heard part of that 
and shook Gurlick. “Don’t you go 
shootin’ your mouth off around 
here, or it’s the cooler for you.”

Gurlick sniveled and mumbled, 
“Yessir, yessir,” and sidled cring- 
ing away. 

“Ah right. Move along. Show’s 
over. Ah right, there . .” 

Gurlick ran. He was out of 
breath before he began to run, so 
his wind lasted him only to the 
edge of the park, where he reeled 
against the railing and clung there 
to whimper his breath back again. 
He stood with his hands over his 
face, his fingers trying to press 
back at that thing inside him, his 
mouth open and noisy with self- 
pity and anoxia. A hand fell on 
his shoulder and he jumped wildly. 

“It’s all right,” said the indig- 
nant woman. “I just wanted to let 
you know everybody in the whole 
world isn’t cruel and mean.” 
Gurlick looked at her, working 
his mouth. She was in her fif- 
ties, round-shouldered, bespec- 
tacled and most earnest. She said, 
“You go right on thinking about 
world peace. Talking about it, too.” 
He was not yet capable of speak- 
ing. He gulped air. 

“You poor man.” She fumbled 
in an edge-flaked patent leather 
pocketbook and found a quarter. 
She held it and sighed as if it 
were an heirloom, and handed it 
to him. He took it unnoticing and 
put it away. He did not thank her. 
He asked, “Do you know?” He 
pressed his temples in that newly 
developed compulsive gesture. “I 
got to find out, see? I got to.” 



“Find out what?” 

“How people can get put back 
together again.” 

“Oh,” she said. “Oh, dear.” She 
mulled it over. “I’m afraid I don’t 
know just what you mean.” 
“Y’see?” he informed his inner 
tormentor, agonized. “Ain’t nobody 
knows — nobody!” 

“Please explain it a little,” the 
woman begged. “Maybe there’s 
some one who can help you, if I 
can’t.” 

Gurlick said hopelessly, “It’s 
about people’s brains, see what I 
mean, how to make all the brains 
go together again.” 

“Oh, you poor man . .” She 
looked at him pityingly, clearly 
certain that his brains indeed 
needed putting together again, and 
Well, at least he realizes it, which 
is a sight more than most of us 
do. “I know! Dr. Langley’s the 
man for you. I clean for him once 
a week, and believe me, if you 
want to know somebody who 
knows about the brain, he’s the 
one. He has a machine that draws 
wiggly lines and he can read them 
and tell what you’re thinking.” 
Gurlick’s vague visualization of 
such a device flashed out to the 
stars, where it had an electrifying 
effect. “Where’s it at?” 

“The machine? Right there in 
his office. He’ll tell you all about 
it; he’s such a dear, kind man. He 
told me all about it, though I’m 
afraid I didn’t quite—”

“Where’s it at?” 

‘Why, in his office. Oh, you 
mean where. Well, it’s 13 Deak 
Street, on the second floor. Look, 
you can almost see it from here. 
Right there where the house with 
the-” 

Without another word, Gurlick 
put down his chin and hunched 
his shoulders and scuttled off. 

“Oh, dear,” murmured the wom- 
an worriedly, “I do hope he doesn’t 
bother Dr. Langley too much. But 
then he wouldn’t; he does believe 
in peace.” She turned away from 
her good deed and started home. 

Gurlick did not bother Dr. 
Langley for long, and he did in- 
deed bring him peace. 

f | ' HERE was a mad boy in 
Rome, and an angry warrior 
in Africa whose yams were being 
stolen at night, and there was the 
thief who stole them. All over 
the world people, with all their 
hearts, did the difficult things they 
must do to be human beings, and 
learned what they had to learn, 
paying what it cost them. Two and 
three-quarter billions . two and 
three-quarter billion subjective 
planets, some circling close to each 
other and to light, and others far 
out and cold in the lonely dark; 
but all separate, isolated, discrete. 
Commissar, peasant, potentate, the 
children, the old ones, the insane, 
the underprivileged — each basi- 
cally alone. 



Guido, the boy in Rome, had 
been born during the fighting at 
Anzio, and was found by an 
unrra team a year and a half 
later, living with some wild chil- 
dren, maggoting the bones of the 
ruined town. He was full of music, 
to a degree notable even in a 
country full of music. Before he 
could talk, he could whistle, and 
he would whistle any music he 
heard after one hearing. In the 
shuffle of souls that followed, he 
was taken in by a Corfu shepherd 
who, in the next ten years, kicked 
the music out of the boy, or per- 
haps he kicked it down. 

The shepherd was a smuggler, 
and though he needed the boy’s 
strong back and hard hands, he 
wanted nothing near him which 
might attract attention. Guido 
dared not utter a phrase of music, 
not a note. The shepherd devel- 
oped a high skill in detection; he 
could be aware of music welling 
up in the boy before Guido him- 
self knew of it, and would knock 
him down and kick him and his 
unborn melodies. And when the 
association between music and 
punishment was strong enough, 
there was no more music from the 
boy — and too much unkillably, 
unquellably inside him. 

After the shepherd died, Guido 
turned into something not quite 
human. He committed a series of 
ingenious nuisances which for a 
long time were lost in the seeth of

the city, unconnected as they 
seemed to be with each other. He 
smashed some stained-glass win- 
dows, and he broke the leg of a 
beggar over a curbstone; he took 
a toy from a child and threw it 
into the river; he vandalized a 
print shop. 

And at last a detective with 
rather more sight, more insight 
than most found the thread upon 
which was strung these episodes; 
for the stained glass was one of 
the windows of the Chapel of the 
Annunciation, and choir practice 
was in session; the beggar was one 
who sang for his supper; the child’s 
toy was a harmonica; the print 
shop was printing sheet music. The 
detective contrived to give Guido 
a violin, and there was, for Guido, 
a burst of light, and would be, in 
time, a very explosion of music 
from him . 

A ND the warrior, Mbala, began 
to guard his yam patch at 
night, which was by custom the 
duty of his dead father, as Mbala 
would one day die and then guard 
the yam patch of his sons. But 
Mbala’s faith in this old belief 
was shaken, for all he could agree 
that his father was supposed to 
guard against devils, not against 
men, and it was manifestly a man 
who was stealing the yams. 

The thief, Nuyu, had once had 
faith in such beliefs too, but he no 
longer believed in anything at all 



but his own clever hands. 

They were, in their own theolo- 
gy, Mbala and Nuyu, backslider 
and atheist respectively. 

And one night, while Mbala 
watched and Nuyu hid, waiting 
him out, there came from the sky 
a floating, glowing sphere. It sank 
to the edge of the yam patch and, 
not quite touching the ground, 
slowly circled the field; and where 
it had passed, the thick tangle of 
bush which surrounded the culti- 
vated land was cleared away, and 
in its place a thin drift of white, 
cold material which changed to 
water in a minute or two. 

Now it happened that the sphere 
was an untenanted and automatic 
machine, and that the weed it 
harvested and processed was as- 
tralagous vetch, which has a high 
affinity for selenium, and the build- 
ers of the machine needed all the 
selenium they could get. 

But to Nuyu the thief, who was 
hiding in the vetch at the time, 
this was retribution not only for 
his current sins, but all his past 
ones, cast as it was in the strange 
figure of a spirit guarding the yams 
— shades of his childhood legends, 
so long laughed away! 

And to Mbala, this was his 
father, not only discovering the 
thief (who came howling and gib- 
bering to huddle in contrite ter- 
ror against Mbala) but at the 
same time clearing more land for 
him.

After the sphere was gone, fall- 
ing upward and away to the north 
(where it had detected another 
stand of vetch), Mbala did not, as 
he had earlier intended, kill his 
thief. Instead, they returned to 
the village, companions in revela- 
tion, each at the peak of a species 
of that rare ecstasy, the religious 
experience : one confirmed, the 

other converted. 

THESE WERE people, these 
are anecdotes dwelt upon for their 
element of the extraordinary. But 
each man alive has such a story, 
unique unto himself, of what is in 
him and of its molding by the 
forces around him, and of his inter- 
pretations of those forces. Here a 
man sees a machine as a god, and 
there a man sees a god as a mere 
kind of angry argument; and an- 
other uses the angry argument of 
others quite as if it were a machine. 
Yet for all his ability to work in 
concert with his fellows, and to in- 
duce some sympathy in their vi- 
brations, he remains isolated; no 
one knows exactly how another 
feels. 

At the very climax of sensa- 
tion, Man approaches unconscious- 
ness . unconsciousness of what? 
Why, of all around him; never of 
himself. 

W V7" OU Doctor Langley?” 

The doctor said, “Good 

God.” 



Dear, kind man he might be to 
his cleaning lady, but to Gurlick 
he was just another clean man full 
of knowledges and affairs which 
Gurlick wouldn’t understand, plus 
the usual, foreseeable anger, dis- 
gust and intolerance Gurlick stimu- 
lated wherever he went. In short, 
just another one of the bastits to 
hate. 

Gurlick said, “You know about 
brains.” 

The doctor said, “Who sent you 
here?” 

“You know what to do to put 
people’s brains together again.” 

“What? Who are you? What do 
you want anyway?” 

“Look,” said Gurlick, “I got to 
find this out, see. You know how 
to do it or not?” 

“I’m afraid,” said the doctor 
icily, “that I can’t answer a ques- 
tion I don’t understand.” 

“So ya don’t know anything 
about brains.” 

The doctor sat tall behind a 
wide desk. His face was tall and 
narrow, and in repose fell natural- 
ly into an expression of arrogance. 
No better example in all the world 
could have been found of the epi- 
tome of everything Gurlick hated 
in his fellow-man. The doctor was 
archetype, coda, essence; and, in 
his presence, Gurlick was so un- 
reasonably angry as almost to for- 
get how to cringe. 

“I didn’t say that,” said Lang- 
ley.

He looked at Gurlick steadily 
for a moment, openly selecting a 
course of action: Throw him out? 
Humor him? Or study him? He 
observed the glaring eyes, the 
trembling mouth, the posture of 
fear-driven aggressiveness. 

He said, “Let’s get something 
straight. I’m not a psychiatrist.” 
Aware that this creature didn’t 
know a psychiatrist from an ac- 
countant, he explained, “I mean I 
don’t treat people who have prob- 
lems. I’m a physiologist, specializ- 
ing on the brain. I’m just interested 
in how brains do what they do. If 
the brain was a motor, you might 
say I am the man who writes the 
manual that the mechanic studies 
before he goes to work. That’s all 
I am, so before you waste your 
own time and mine, get that 
straight. If you want me to recom- 
mend somebody who can help you 
with whatev— ” 

“You tell me,” Gurlick barked, 
“you just tell me that one thing 
and that’s all you got to do.” 

“What one thing?” 

Exasperated, adding his impa- 
tience with all his previous fail- 
ures to his intense dislike of this 
new enemy, Gurlick growled, “I 
tole ya.” When this got no re- 
sponse, and when he understood 
from the doctor’s expression that 
it would get none, he blew angrily 
from his nostrils and explained, 
“Once everybody in the world had 
just the one brain, see what I 



mean? Now they all took apart. 
All you got to tell me is how to 
stick ’em together again.” 

“You seem to be pretty sure 
that everybody— how’s that again? 
— had the same brain once.” 

G URLICK listened to some- 
thing inside him. Then. “Had 
to be like that,” he said. 

“Why did it have to be?” 
Gurlick waved a vague hand. 
“All this. Buildin’s, cars, tools, 
’lectric, all like that. This don’t git 
done without the people all think 
with like one head.” 

“It did get done that way, 
though. People can work together 
without— thinking together. That is 
what you mean, isn’t it— all think- 
ing at once, like a f hive of bees?” 
“Bees, yeah.” 

“It didn’t happen that way with 
people. What made you think it 
did?” 

A startled computation was 
made among the stars, and, given 
the axioms which had proved un- 
alterably and invariably true here- 
tofore, namely, that a species did 
not reach this high a level of tech- 
nology without the hive-mind to 
organize it, there was only one way 
to account for the doctor’s incred- 
ible statement— providing he did 
not lie — and Gurlick, informed of 
this conclusion, did his best to 
phrase it. “I guess what happened 
was everybody broke all apart, 
they on their own now, they just

don’t remember no more. I don’t 
remember it, you don’t remember 
it, that one time you and me and 
everybody was part of one great 
big brain.” 

“I wouldn’t believe that,” said 
the doctor, “even if it was true.” 
“Sure not,” Gurlick agreed, ob- 
viously and irritatingly taking the 
doctor’s statement as a proof of 
his own. “Well, I still got to find 
out how to stick ’em all together 
again.” 

“You won’t find it out from me. 
I don’t know. So why don’t you 
just go and—” 

“You got a machine, it knows 
what you’re thinkin’,” said Gurlick 
suddenly. 

“I have a machine which does 
nothing of the kind. Who told you 
about me, anyway?” 

“You show me that machine.” 
“Certainly not. Look, this has 
been very interesting, but I’m busy 
and I can’t talk to you any more. 
Now be a good—” 

“You got to show it to me,” said 
Gurlick in a terrifying whisper, for 
through his fogbound mind had 
shot his visions (she’s in the water 
up to her neck, saying, Hello, 
Handsome, and he just grins, and 
she says, I’m coming out, and he 
says, Come on then, and slowly 
she starts up toward him, the water 
down to her collarbones, to her 
chest, to—) and a smoky curl of 
his new agony. He had to get this 
information. He must. 



r | 'HE doctor pressed himself 
away from his desk a few 
inches in alarm. “That’s the ma- 
chine over there. It won’t make 
the slightest sense to you. I’m not 
trying to hide anything from you 
— it’s just that you wouldn’t un- 
derstand it.” 

Gurlick sidled over to the equip- 
ment the doctor had pointed to. 
He stood looking at it for a time, 
flashing a cautious ratlike glance 
toward the doctor from time to 
time, and pulling at his mouth. 
“What you call this thing?” 

“An electroencephalograph. Are 
you satisfied?” 

“How’s it know what you’re 
thinkin’?” 

“It doesn’t. It picks up electrical 
impulses from a brain and turns 
them into wavy lines on a strip 
of paper.” 

Watching Gurlick, the doctor 
saw clearly that in some strange 
way, his visitor was not thinking of 
the next question; he was waiting 
for it. He could see it arrive. 

“Open it up,” said Gurlick. 

“What?” 

“Open it. I got to look at the 
stuff inside it.” 

“Now look here! I—” 

Again that frightening hiss: “I 
got to see it.” 

The doctor sighed in exaspera- 
tion and pulled open the file 
drawer of his desk. He located a 
manual, slapped it down on the 
desk, leafed through and opened it.

“There’s a picture of the machine. 
This is a wiring diagram. If it 
makes any sense to you, it’ll tell 
you more than a look inside would 
tell you. I hope it tells you that the 
thing’s far too complicated for a 
man without train—” 

Gurlick snatched up the manual 
and stared at it. His eyes glazed 
and cleared. He put the manual 
down and pointed. “These here 
lines is wires?” 

“Yes . .” 

“This here?” 

“A rectifier. It’s a tube. You 
know what a tube is.” 

“Like radio tubes. Electric is in 
these here wires?” 

“This can’t mean anyth—” 
“What’s this here?” 

“Those little lines? Ground. 
Here, and here, and over here, the 
current goes to ground.” 

Gurlick placed a grimy finger- 
tip on the transformer symbol. 
“This changes the electric. Right?” 
Dumfounded, Langley nodded. 
Gurlick said, “Regular electric 
comes in here. Some other kind 
comes in here. What comes in here, 
huh?” 

“That’s the detector. The input. 
The electrodes. I mean whatever 
brain the machine is hooked up to 
feeds current in there.” 

“It ain’t very much.” 

“It ain’t,” mimicked the doctor 
weakly, “very much.” 

“You got one of those strips with 
the wavy lines?” 



ORDLESSLY, the doctor 
opened a drawer, found a 
trace and tossed it on top of the 
diagram. Gurlick pored over it for 
a long moment, referring twice to 
the wiring diagram, then threw it 
down. “Okay. Now I found out.” 
“You found out what?” 

“What I wanted.” 

“Will you be kind enough to 
tell me just what you found?” 
“God,” said Gurlick disgustedly, 
“how sh’d 7 know?” 

Langley shook his head, ready 
to laugh at this mystifying and ir- 
ritating visitation. “Well, if you’ve 
found it, you don’t have to stick 
around.” 

“Shut up,” said Gurlick, cocking 
his head, closing his eyes. Langley 
waited. 

It was like hearing one side of a 
phone conversation, but there was 
no phone. “How the hell I’m sup- 
posed to do that?” Gurlick com- 
plained at one point, and, later, 
“I gon’ need money for anything 
like that. No, I can’t. I can’t, I tell 
ya; you just gon’ git me in th’ 
clink . what you think he gon’ 
be doin’ while I take it?” 

“Who are you talking to?” Lang- 
ley demanded. 

“I dunno,” said Gurlick. “Shut 
up now.” He fixed his gaze on the 
doctor’s face, and for seconds it 
was unseeing. Then, suddenly, it 
was not, and Gurlick spoke to 
him: “I got to have money.” 

“I’m not giving any handouts

this season. Now get out of here.” 

Gurlick, showing all the signs of 
an unwelcome internal goading, 
came around the desk and re- 
peated his demand. As he did so, 
he saw for the very first time that 
Doctor Langley sat in a wheel- 
chair. 

That made all the difference in 
the world to Gurlick. 

TTENRY was tall. He stood tall 
and had a surprisingly adult 
face, which made him all the more 
ridiculous as he sat through school 
day after day, weeping. He did 
not cry piteously nor with bellows 
of rage and outrage, but almost 
silently, with a series of widely 
spaced, soft, difficult sniffs. He did 
what he was told (get in line . 
move your chairs, it’s story time 
. fetch the puzzles . put away 
the paints), but he did not speak 
and would not play or dance or 
sing or laugh. He would only sit, 
stiff as a spike, and sniff. Henry 
was five and kindergarten was 
tough for him. Life was tough for 
him. 

“Life is tough,” his father was 
fond of saying, “and the little 
coward might as well learn.” 

Henry’s mother disagreed, but 
deviously. She lied to everyone 
concerned — to her husband, to 
Henry’s teacher, to the school psy- 
chologist and the principal and to 
Henry himself. She told her hus- 
band she was shopping in the 



mornings, but instead she was sit- 
ting in the corner of the kinder- 
garten room watching Henry cry- 
ing. After two weeks of this, the 
psychologist and the principal 
corralled her and explained to her 
that the reality of home involved 
having her at home, the reality of 
school involved not having her at 
school, and Henry was not going 
to face the reality of school until 
he could experience it without her. 

She agreed immediately, be- 
cause she always agreed with any- 
one who had a clear opinion about 
anything, went back to the room, 
told the stricken Henry that she 
would be waiting just outside, and 
marched out. She completely over- 
looked the fact that Henry could 
see her from the window, see her 
walk down the path and get into 
her car and drive away. If he had 
any composure left after that, it 
was destroyed a few minutes later 
when, having circled the block and 
concealed her car, she crept back 
past the Keep off the Grass sign 
and spent the rest of the morning 
peeping in the window. 

Henry saw her right away, but 
the teacher and the principal 
didn’t catch onto it for weeks. 
Henry continued to sit stiffly and 
hiss out his occasional sobs, won- 
dering numbly what there was 
about school so terrifying as to 
make his mother go to such lengths 
to protect him, and, whatever it 
was, feeling silent horror of it.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Henry’s father did what he could 
about Henry’s cowardice. It pained 
him because, though he was cer- 
tain it didn’t come from his side, 
other people might not know that. 

He told Henry ghost stories 
about sheeted phantasms which ate 
little boys, and then sent him up to 
bed in the dark, in a room where 
there was a hot-air register open- 
ing directly into the ceiling of the 
room below. The father had 
troubled to spread a sheet over 
the register, and when he heard 
the boy’s door open and close, he 
shoved a stick up through the 
register and moaned. The white 
form rising up out of the floor 
elicited no sound or movement 
from Henry, so the father went 
upstairs laughing, to see the effect 
he had not heard. 

A S stiff as ever, straight and tall, 
Henry stood motionless in the 
dark, so his father turned on the 
light and looked him over, and 
then gave him a good whaling. 

“Five years old,” he told the 
mother when he got back down- 
stairs, “and he wets his pants yet.” 
He jumped out shouting at Hen- 
ry from around comers and hid 
in closets and made animal noises 
and he gave him ruthless orders to 
go out and punch eight- and ten- 
year-olds in the nose and warmed 
his seat for him when he refused, 
but he just couldn’t seem to make 
the little sissy into anything else. 



“Blood will tell,” he used to say 
knowingly to the mother who had 
never stood up to anyone in her 
life and had manifestly tainted the 
boy. But he clung to the hope that 
he could do something about it, 
and he kept trying. 

Henry was afraid when his par- 
ents quarreled, because the father 
shouted and the mother wept; but 
he was afraid when they did not 
quarrel too. This was a special fear, 
raised to its peak on the occasions 
when the father spoke to him pleas- 
antly, smiling. Undoubtedly the 
father himself did not realize it, 
but his pattern for punishing the 
boy was invariably a soft-voiced, 
smiling approach and a sudden 
burst of brutality, and Henry had 
become incapable of discriminat- 
ing between a genuine pleasantry 
and one of these cheerful precur- 
sors to punishment. 

Meanwhile, his mother coddled 
and cuddled him secretly and un- 
systematically, secretly violated his 
father’s deprivations by contra- 
banding to him too much cookies 
and candy, yet all the while turned 
a cold and unresponsive back to 
any real or tacit plea for help in 
the father’s presence. 

Henry’s natural curiosity, along 
with his normal rebelliousness, had 
been thoroughly excised when they 
first showed themselves in his sec- 
ond and third years, and at five 
he was so trained that he would 
take nothing not actually handed

to him by a recognized authority, 
go nowhere and do nothing unless 
and until clearly instructed to do 
so. Children should be seen and 
not heard. Do not speak unless 
spoken to. 

“Why didn’t you poke that kid 
right in the nose? Why? Why?” 
“Daddy, I—” “Shaddup, you little 
yellow-belly. I don’t want to hear 
excuses.” 

So tall little, sad little Henry sat 
sniffing in kindergarten, and was 
numbly silent everywhere else. 

A FTER clubbing Dr. Langley 
with the floor-lamp, Gurlick 
rummaged around as ordered, and, 
bearing a bundle, went shopping. 
The Medusa permitted him to 
shop for himself first, quite willing 
to concede that he knew the sub- 
tleties of his own matrix better than 
it did. He got a second-hand suit 
from a hockshop in the tenderloin 
district, and a shave and a trim at 
the barber college. 

Esthetically, the improvement 
was negligible; socially, it was 
enormous. He was able to get what 
he wanted, though none of it was 
easy, since he personally knew the 
names of none of the things he was 
compelled to buy. 

Probably the metal samples 
were hardest of all to acquire; he 
had to go into an endless succes- 
sion of glassy-eyed silences before 
a bewildered lab-supply clerk un- 
dertook to show him a periodic 



table of the elements. Once he had 
that, things moved more rapidly. 

By pointing and mumbling and 
asking and trancing, he acquired 
lab - demonstration samples of 
nickel, aluminum, iron, copper, 
selenium, carbon and certain 
others. He asked for but could not 
afford deuterium, four-nines pure 
tantalum, and six-nines silver. The 
electrical-supply houses frustrated 
him deeply on the matter of small- 
gauge wire with a square cross- 
section, but someone directed him 
to a jewelry-findings store and he 
finally had what he wanted. 

By now he was burdened with 
a wooden crate rigged, by an ac- 
commodating clerk, into something 
approximating a foot-locker in size 
and shape, with a rope handle to 
carry it by. His destination was de- 
cided after a painful prodding ses- 
sion by the Medusa, which dug 
out of Gurlick’s unwilling brain a 
memory that Gurlick himself had 
long ago let vanish — a brief and 
unprofitable stab at prospecting, or 
rather at carrying the pack for a 
friend who was stabbing at it, years 
ago. The important facet of the 
memory was an abandoned shack 
miles from anywhere, together with 
a rough idea of how to get there. 

So Gurlick took a bus and an- 
other bus, and stole a jeep and 
abandoned it, and at last, cursing 
his tormentors, slavering for his 
dream, and wailing his discomfort, 
he walked. 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Heavy woods, an upland of scrub 
pine and dwarf maple, then a 
jagged rock ridge — that was it; 
and the roofless remnant of the 
shack like a patch of decay be- 
tween and against the stained 
tooth-roots of the snaggly ridge. 

More than water, more than 
food or to be left alone, Gurlick 
wanted rest, but he was not al- 
lowed it. Panting and sniffling, he 
fell to his knees and began to fum- 
ble with the ropes on his burden. 
He took out the mercury cells and 
the metal slugs and the wire and 
tube-sockets, and began to jumble 
them together. 

He didn’t know what he was 
doing and he didn’t have to. The 
work was being done by an ag- 
gregate of computing wills scat- 
tered across the heavens, partly by 
direct orders, partly by a semi- 
direct control, brain to neurone, 
bypassing that foggy swamp which 
comprised Gurlick’s consciousness. 

Gurlick disliked the whole thing 
mightily, but except for a lachry- 
mose grumble, no protest was pos- 
sible. So he blubbered and slaved, 
and did not, could not, let up until 
it was finished. 

YW/"HEN it was finished, Gurlick 
” was released. He stumbled 
away from it, as if a rope under 
tension had tied him and was sud- 
denly cut. He dropped heavily, 
reared up on his elbows to blink at 
the thing, and then exhaustion 



overcame him and he slumped and 
slept. 

When he fell asleep, the thing 
was a tangle of components, pos- 
sessing (to any trained terrestrial 
eye) a certain compelling sym- 
metry and an elaborate uselessness 
(but how useless would seem a 
variable frequency oscillator to a 
wise Bushman or a savage from 
Madison Avenue?); but when he 
awoke, the picture was different. 
Very different. 

What Gurlick had built was not, 
in actuality, a matter receiver, al- 
though it acted as if such a thing 
were a possibility. It was, rather, 
a receiver and amplifier for a cer- 
tain “band” in the “thought” “spec- 
trum”— each of these terms being 
analogous and general. 

The first receiver, and its be- 
Gurlicked attachments, turned in- 
formation into manipulation, and 
constructed, from the elemental 
samples Gurlick had supplied it, 
a second and much more efficient 
machine of far greater capacity. 
This in turn received and manipu- 
lated yet a third receiver and 
manipulator; and this one was a 
heavy-duty device. The process 
was, in essence, precisely that of 
the sailor who takes a heaving- 
line to draw in a rope which brings 
him a hawser. 

In a brief span of hours, ma- 
chines were making machines to 
use available matter to make ma- 
chines which would scout out and 



TO MARRY MEDUSA 



37 



procure locally unavailable mat- 
ter, which was returned to the site 
and used by other machines to 
make yet others, all specialized, 
and certain of these in immense 
numbers. 

Gurlick came unbidden out of 
that dream, where, as he sat on the 
bank on the pile of clothes, shiny 
black and red and an edge of lacy 
white, he was greeted (Hello, 
Handsome ) by her who so boldly 
(after he refused to go away) be- 
gan to come up out of the water, 
slowly and gleaming in the sun- 
light, the water now down to her 
waist, and she was beginning to 
smile— 

He awoke in the midst of an 
incredible clanking city. Around 
him were row upon row of huge 
blind machines, spewing forth 
more machines by the moment : 

Tanklike things with long snake 
necks and heads surrounded by a 
circlet of trumpets; silver balls ten 
feet in diameter, which now and 
then would flick silently into the 
air, too fast to be believed, too 
silent; low, wide, massive devices 
which slid snaillike along roads of 
their own making, snouted with a 
projector which put out a strange 
beam which would have been like 
light if it were not cut off at the 
far end as if by an invisible wall; 
and with these, sniffing along the 
rocks, some of which trembled and 
slumped; and then there would be 
a movement up the beam to the 

38 



machine, and from behind the ma- 
chine, silvery ingots were laid like 
eggs while fine cold dust gouted 
off to the side. 

URLICK awoke surrounded 
by this, blinking and staring 
stupidly. It was some minutes later 
that he realized where he was— 
atop a column of earth, ten feet in 
diameter and perhaps thirty feet 
high. All around, for hundreds of 
yards, the ground had been ex- 
cavated and . used. 

At the edge of his little plateau 
was a small domed box which, 
when his eye fell on it, popped 
open and slid a flat bowl of hot, 
mushlike substance toward him. 
He picked it up and smelled it. 
He tasted it, shrugged, grunted, 
raised the bowl to his lips and 
dozed its contents into his mouth 
with the heel of his hand. Its 
warmth in his belly was soothing, 
then puzzling, then frightening, the 
way it grew. He put his hands to 
his beltline and abruptly sat down, 
staring at his numb and disobedi- 
ent legs. 

Dazed, he looked out across the 
busy scape, and saw approaching 
him a stilted device with endless 
treads for feet and a turtlelike 
housing, perhaps a dozen feet in 
diameter, approaching. It straddled 
his imprisoning column of earth, 
achieving a sort of mechanical tip 
toe, and the carapace began to 
descend over him and all his perch, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



like a great slow candle-snuffer. 
He now could not speak, nor could 
he sit up any longer; he fell back 
and lay helpless, staring up and 
silently screaming . 

But as the device, its underside 
alive with more wriggling tool- 
tipped limbs than has a horseshoe 
crab, slowly covered him, he was 
flooded with reassurance and 
promise, a special strength (its 
specialty : to make him feel strong 
but in no wise be strong) and the 
nearest thing to peace that he had 
ever known. He was informed 
that he was to undergo a simple 
operation, and that it was good, oh, 
good. He was informed why: 

The spore, the “raisin,” had been 
life or its surrogate. It had trav- 
ersed space physically, bodily, and 
it had finished its function and its 
capabilities with its invasion of 
Gurlick. But the transfer of the 
life-essence of all the Medusa into 
all of humanity was something that 
Earth-built machines — even if 
Earth-built machines — even if 
not accomplish. Only life can trans- 
mit life. A very slight alteration 
indeed — an adjustment of iso- 
topes in certain ionized elements 
in Gurlick’s ductless glands— would 
make the membership of humanity 
in the corpus of the Medusa a cer- 
tainty. 

The machines now abuilding 
would effectively restore (the Me- 
dusa still unswervingly operated 
from a conviction that this was a 



restoration) the unity of the hu- 
man species, its hive-mind, so that 
each “person” could reach, and 
be reached by, all persons; but 
the fusion with the Medusa would 
be Gurlick’s special chore and 
would take place on the instant 
that his seed married with the 
ovum of a human female, much 
like — he received two pictures: a 
pair of bees in nuptial flight, then 
a huge, busy, buzzing hive — with, 
of course, himself in the all-power- 
ful tended center. But with the dif- 
ference, he was given to understand 
without understanding, that it 
would somehow be simultaneous. 

As the machine slowly closed 
over him, its deft limbs already 
performing the first of a hundred 
delicate manipulations, it caught 
up his dream and congratulated 
him on it, and gave it detail and 
depth his creative poverty had 
never made possible to him be- 
fore, so that he lived it realer than 
real, from the instant of approach 
(and a degree of anticipation 
which might have destroyed him 
had he felt it earlier) to the mo- 
ments of consummation, so violent 
they shook the Earth and sent the 
sky itself acrinkle with ripples of 
delighted color. 

And more: for in these tactile 
inventions there was no human 
limitation, and it was given to him 
to proceed again, and yet again, 
without exhaustion or dulling fam- 
iliarity, either through the entire 



TO MARRY MEDUSA 



39 



episode or through any smallest 
part of it, whether it be the thrill 
of seeing the clothes (shiny black 
and scarlet, and the tumbled frost- 
ing of lace-edged white) or the 
pounding, fainting climax. 

Always, too, was the laughing 
offhand promise that any conquest 
of Gurlick’s would be such a peak, 
or a higher one; let him wallow in 
his dream because he loved it, but 
let him understand also that it 
was only one of many, the symbol 
of any, the quality of all. 

So, while it built its machines 
to fuse (“again”) the scattered 
psyche of humanity, it got Gurlick 
—good— and— ready. 

TF it isn’t now, boy, Paul San- 
ders told himself, it never will 
be. Keeping one hand between the 
girl’s gossamer-clad shoulderblades, 
he slid gently off the sofa, stood, 
stooped, and lifted Charlotte Dun- 
say in his arms. 

Dimity (nee Salome) Car- 
michael had put in a long day. 
Full of her thoughts of it, she put 
her thoughts by; standing in her 
showerstall, she slipped into a de- 
licious suspension, her hand rest- 
ing on the chrome handle marked 
Hot - Cold. 

In Rome, a mad boy walked, 
incapable of hate, no longer 
hunted, his pressured rebellions 
having been caught at the kindling 
point and flung into a violin case. 
There was nothing left in Guido, 



no room for anything in Guido, but 
a heady joy and a fierce passion 
for this hard-gleaming, carven 
miracle under his arm, waiting as 
sensitive as a naked nerve the 
hungry reach of his unshackled 
talent. No lover, no miser, no 
acolyte on Earth loved woman or 
money or Master more than Guido 
loved this violin; no whelping 
wolverine, no wounded water buf- 
falo was quite so watchful for an 
enemy. 

Henry, five years old, slept as 
usual flat on his back and face 
straight up, arms rigid, fists 
clenched under and pinned down 
by his buttocks, and his ankles to- 
gether. He was having a night- 
mare, soundlessly, of being sur- 
rounded by gentle smiling fathers, 
some of whom wore the masks of 
the other kids in his class, and 
storekeepers, and passing puppy- 
dogs, but who were really just smil- 
ing fathers, dressed up and being 
gentle at the very verge of ex- 
ploding in his face. 

And between him and all the 
fathers was a loving goddess with 
soft hands full of forbidden lolli- 
pops and peanut-butter sandwiches 
to be passed to little boys in the 
dark when they had been sent to 
bed without their suppers because 
they were little cowards; this god- 
dess was there to care for him and 
protect him, but when the ex- 
plosion came, with this breath or 
the next or the one after, the pup- 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



pies and children and grocers and 
fathers would whisk through to 
him as if the goddess weren’t 
there at all; and while they did 
what they would do to him, she 
would still be there smiling and 
ready with guilty lollipops, not 
knowing what the fathers were 
doing to him . 

And under this nightmare was 
the color of hopelessness, the ab- 
solute certainty that to awake from 
it would be to emerge into it; the 
dream and the world were one 
now, fused and identical. 

They left the kraal, all of them, 
the infants carried dangling from 
headbands or piggyback, the tod- 
dlers awed and huddling together, 
the adults hushed and wondering; 
and, leading them, Mbala who had 
regained his faith and Nuyu who 
had found his. The village had not 
far to go, kraal to yam patch; and 
yet it was a pilgrimage of sorts, 
the devout fired by the transfig- 
ured, coming to witness the miracle 
of the cleared field. 

These are motes among the mil- 
lions, remarked upon for that about 
them which is remarkable, yet dif- 
ferent only insofar as each is dif- 
ferent from, or has a difference of, 
some quality, and pattern of quali- 
ties, repeated two and three-quar- 
ter billion living times under this 
sun. There is a place in this nar- 
rative for all those close enough 
to each of us to be called You, 
and for that far more limited and 



select company (for many can 
call a man You), the privileged 
who are entitled to call themselves 
“I” (so few may do this, no two 
the same). Peon, peasant, fellahin, 
jibaro, mass-men with their hard 
hands: matador, mariner, apothe- 
cary, salesman, tilt-tongued with 
their special cants, canted each one 
to a special askew; this is their 
tale too. 

G URLICK lay hooded and un- 
aware, passive under the sub- 
microscopic manipulations of the 
machine which brought his special 
membership in the Medusa to his 
seed. So he did not observe the 
change in the mighty operations 
around him, when the egg-laying 
snail-gaited miners drew in and 
darkened the snouts of light, and 
fell neatly apart to have their sub- 
stance incorporated in other, more 
needed machines; and these in turn 
complete their special tasks and 
segment and disperse to others 
which still needed them, until at 
last there remained only the long- 
necked, tank-treaded, trumpet- 
headed ones, and enough silver 
spheres to carry them, in their mul- 
ti-thousands, to their precisely 
mapped destinations. 

There was no provision for fail- 
ure, for there would be no failure. 
The nature of the electroenceph- 
alograph, and of its traces, clearly 
showed to the transcendant sci- 
ence of the Medusa exactly what 



TO MARRY MEDUSA 



41 



was lacking in the average mind 
which kept it from being a com- 
mon mind. 

The net would be comparative- 
ly simple to cast and draw shut, 
for it found the potent base of the 
hive mentality alive and awaiting 
it, showing itself wherever humans 
blindly moved in the paths of 
other humans, purely because other 
humans so moved; wherever 
friends apart impulsively sat down 
to write one another simultaneous 
letters, wherever men in groups 
(cartels, committees, mobs, and 
nations) divided their intelligence 
by their numbers and let that in- 
credible quotient chart their course. 

The possible or probable nature 
of a human hive, once (re) estab- 
lished, was a question hardly ex- 
plored, because it was hardly im- 
portant. Once united, humanity 
would join the Medusa, because 
the Medusa always (not almost, 
not “in virtually every case,” but 
always ) infused the hives it 
touched. 

So the factory area rumbled to 
silence, and the noiseless spheres 
swept over the storage yard and 
scooped up their clusters of long- 
necked projectors, fell away up 
with them, flashed away to all the 
comers of Earth, ready to place 
the projectors wherever their ema- 
nations (part sound, part some- 
thing else) would reach masses of 
humans. 

They could not reach all hu- 



mans, but they would reach most, 
and the established hive would 
then draw in the rest. No human 
would escape; none could; none 
would want to. 

Then, somewhere in this flaw- 
less, undivided, multi-skilled en- 
tity, Gurlick would plant a tiny 
fleck of himself, and at the in- 
stant of fusion between it and a 
living ovum, the Medusa would 
spread through it like crystalliza- 
tion through a supersaturated solu- 
tion. 

J UST another rash of saucer- 
sightings, thought the few ob- 
servers, and recipients of their ob- 
servations, in the brief minutes left 
to them to think as they had al- 
ways thought. 

Some of the military had, in 
these minutes, a harrowing per- 
plexity. Anything tracked at such 
speeds as the radars reported must, 
with small variations, appear some- 
where along an extrapolated path; 
the higher the speed, the finer the 
extrapolation. 

The few recordings made of the 
flick and flash of these objects 
yielded flight-paths on which the 
objects simply did not appear. It 
was manifestly impossible for them 
to check and drop straight to their 
destinations at such velocities; they 
did, however, and before the theo- 
reticians could finish their redefi- 
nition of “impossible,” they and 
all their co-workers, colleagues, ac-

quaintances, cohabitants, heirs and 
assigns were relieved of the neces- 
sity to calculate. 

It happened so quickly, one 
minute a heterogenous mass of 
seething non-communicants, the 
next, the end of Babel. 

tTE stood motionless with the 
girl in his arms, ready to put 
her down on the sofa; and then, 
without a start, without a word of 
.wonderment, Paul Sanders set her 
on her feet and stood supporting 
her with a firm arm around her 
shoulders until her head cleared 
and she could stand alone. 

There was nothing said, because 
there was in that moment nothing 
to be said. In a split second there 
was orientation of a transcendant 
nature — nothing as crude as mu- 
tual mind-reading, but an instant 
and permeating acknowledgment 
of relationships, I to you, we to the 
rest of the world; the nature of a 
final and overriding decision, and 
the clear necessity of instant and 
specific action. 

Together, Paul Sanders and 
Charlotte Dunsay left her apart- 
ment. The hallway was full of 
people in all stages of dress — all 
moving wordlessly, purposefully. 
No one paid Charlotte, in her 
nylon nightgown, the slightest at- 
tention. 

They walked to the elevator 
bank. She paused before it with 
a half-dozen other people, and he 



opened the door of the fire stairs 
and sprang up them two at a time. 
Emerging on the roof, he went to 
the kiosk which sheltered the ele- 
vator motor and cables, twisted off 
the light padlock with one easy 
motion, opened the door and en- 
tered. He had never been here be- 
fore in his life; yet without hesita- 
tion he reached to the left and 
scooped up a five-foot slice bar 
which lay across the grating, and 
ran with it down the fire stairs. 

Without glancing at floor num- 
bers, he left the fire stairs on the 
fourth floor, turned left and ran 
down the hall. The last door on 
the right opened as he reached it; 
he did not glance at the old lady 
who held it for him, nor did she 
speak. He sped through a foyer, 
a living room, and a bedroom, 
opened the window at the far right 
and climbed out. 

There was a narrow ledge on 
which he could barely keep his 
balance and carry the heavy bar as 
well, yet he managed it. The chief 
enemy of a balancing man is the 
poison of fear which permeates 
him: Fit fall! I’ll fall! but Paul 
felt no fear at all. He made a 
rapid succession of two-inch side- 
wise shuffles until he reached the 
big eyebolt from which there hung, 
out and down, the huge chain sup- 
porting one end of a massive 
theater marquee. Here he turned 
sidewise and squatted, brought his 
bar up over his shoulder and,

reaching down, thrust the tip 
through the fourth link of the 
chain. Then he waited. 

The street below — what he 
could see of it — seemed at first 
glance to be normally tenanted, 
with about as many people about 
as one might expect at this hour 
of a Saturday night. But then it 
could be seen that nobody strolled 
— everyone walked briskly and 
with purpose; one or two people 
ran, the way they ran indicating 
running to, not from anything. He 
saw Charlotte Dunsay cross the 
street, swinging along on her bare 
feet, and enter a showroom where 
computing machines were on dis- 
play. Though the place had been 
closed since noon, it was now open 
and lighted, and full of people 
silently and rapidly working. 

There came a sound, and more 
than a sound, a deep pervasive ulu- 
lation which seemed at first to be 
born in all the air and under the 
Earth, sourceless. But as it grew 
louder, Paul heard it more from 
his left, and finally altogether from 
the corner of the building. What- 
ever was making that sound was 
crawling slowly up the street to 
take its place at the intersection, 
a major one where three avenues 
crossed. 

Patiently, Paul Sanders waited. 

t'ROM his soundless nightmare, 
Henry soundlessly awoke. He 
slid out of bed and trotted out of 

44 



his room, past his parents’ open 
door — they were awake, but he 
said nothing, and if they saw him, 
they said nothing either. Henry 
padded down the stairs and out 
into the warm night. He turned 
downtown at a dog-trot and ran 
for three blocks south, one west, 
and two south. He may or may not 
have noticed that while the traffic 
lights still operated, they were no 
longer obeyed by anyone, includ- 
ing himself. Uncannily, cars and 
pedestrians set their courses and 
their speeds and held them, re- 
gardless of blind corners, passing 
and repassing each other without 
incident and with no perceptible 
added effort. 

Henry had been aware for some 
time of the all but subsonic hoot- 
ing and of its rapid increase in vol- 
ume as he ran. When he reached 
the big intersection, he saw the 
source of the sound on the same 
street he ran on, but past the cor- 
ner where the theater stood. It was 
a heavy tanklike machine, sur- 
mounted by a long flexible neck, 
on top of which four horns, like 
square megaphones or speakers, 
emitted the sound. The neck 
weaved back and forth, tilting the 
horns and changing their direction 
in an elaborate repetitive motion, 
which had the effect of adding a 
slow and disturbing vibrato to the 
sound. 

Henry dashed across the street 
and under the side-street marquee. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He came abreast of the thing just 
as it was about to enter the inter- 
section. 

Without once breaking stride, 
Henry turned and dived straight 
into the small space between the 
drive-spindle of the machine’s 
tread and its carrier rollers. His 
blood spouted, and on it the 
spindle spun for a moment; the 
other track, still driving, caused the 
machine to swerve suddenly and 
bump up on the sidewalk under 
the marquee. 

Paul Sanders, at the very instant 
the child had leaped, and before 
the small head and hands entered 
the machine’s drive, leaned out 
and down and jammed the chisel 
point of his slice-bar hard through 
the fourth link of the chain. Plung- 
ing outward, his momentum car- 
ried the bar around the chain and, 
as his weight came upon it, gave 
the chain a prodigious twist. 

The eyebolt pulled out of the 
building wall with a screech, and 
the corner of the marquee sagged 
and then, as the weight of the 
chain came upon it, and Paul San- 
der’s muscular body with it, the 
marquee let go altogether and 
came hammering down on the ma- 
chine. 

In a welter of loose bricks, sheet- 
tin, movie-sign lettering and gir- 
ders, the machine heaved mightily, 
its slipping treads grating and 
shrieking on the pavement. But it 
could not free itself. Its long neck 



and four-horned head twitched and 
slammed against the street for a 
moment, and then the deep howl 
faded and was gone, and the head 
slumped down and lay still. 

Four men ran to the wreckage, 
two of them pushing a dolly on 
which rode an oxy-acetylene out- 
fit. One man went instantly to 
work taking measurements with 
scale, micrometer and calipers. 
Two others had the torch going in 
seconds and fell to work testing 
for a portion of the machine which 
might be cut away. The fourth 
man, with abrasive rasps and a 
cold chisel, began investigating the 
dismantling of the thing. 

And meanwhile, in unearthly si- 
lence and with steady determina- 
tion, people passed and repassed, 
on foot, in cars, and went about 
their business. No crowd collected. 
Why should it? Everybody knew. 

'T’HE entire village population, 
with Mbala and Nuyu at their 
head and the witch-doctor follow- 
ing, were within two hundred yards 
of Mbala’s yam patch when the 
thing came down from the sky. It 
was broad daylight here, so the 
ghostly luminous moonlet effect 
was missing; but the shape of the 
projector as it dangled by invisible 
bands from the sphere was outre 
enough, unprecedented enough, to 
bring a gasp of astonishment and 
fear from the villagers. Mbala 
stopped and bowed down and 



TO MARRY MEDUSA 



45 



called his father’s name, and all 
the people followed suit. 

The sphere dropped rapidly to 
the yam patch, which happened to 
be in a spot known locally as 
Giant’s Voice — a flat area sur- 
rounded by four great ship’s prow 
monoliths, the result of some an- 
cient cataclysm which cleft the 
hill north and south, and again 
northwest by southeast. It was 
said that a man could shout here 
and be heard around the world. 
Exaggeration or no, it was, judg- 
ing by the photograph taken by the 
selenium miner, an ideal position 
for a projector, and here it was. 

The sphere set down its bur- 
den and started up again without 
pause, swift as a bouncing ball. 
The projector began its wavering 
bass hooting, which swept out 
through the echoing clefts of the 
Giant’s Voice, rolled down upon 
the villagers, and silenced their 
chant as if it had blotted it up. 

There was a moment — mere 
seconds — of frozen inaction, and 
then half the warriors turned as 
one man and plunged away 
through the jungle. The rest, and 
all the women and children, drew 
together, over four hundred of 
them, and poured swiftly up the 
slope toward the yam patch. No 
one said a word or made a sound, 
yet when they choked the space 
between two of the stone steeples, 
half the people ran into the clear- 
ing, skirting its edge, while half 



squatted where they were, block- 
ing their avenue from side to side. 
The runners reach the north open- 
ing, filled it, and also squatted, 
wordless and waiting. 

Directly across from the first 
group, in the westward opening, 
there was movement, as one, two, 
a dozen, a hundred heads ap- 
peared, steadily and quietly ap- 
proaching. It was the Ngubwe, 
neighboring villagers with whom 
there was a tradition, now quies- 
cent, of wife-stealing and warfare 
going back to the most ancient 
days. Mbala’s people and the 
Ngubwe, though aware of each 
other at all times, were content to 
respect each other’s privacy and 
each cultivate his own garden, and 
for the past thirty years or so, 
there had been room enough for 
everybody. 

7VTOW three openings to the rock- 

^ rimmed plateau were filled 
with squatting, patient natives. 
Even the babies were silent. For 
nearly an hour there was no sound 
but the penetrating, disturbing 
howl of the projector, no motion 
but its complex, hypnotic pattern 
of weavings and turnings. And 
then there was a new sound. 

Blast after shrill blast, the angry 
sound approached, and the wait- 
ing people rose to their feet. The 
women tore their clothes to get 
bright rags, the men filled their 
lungs and emptied them, and filled 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



them again, getting ready. 

Through the open southern gate- 
way, four warriors erupted, howl- 
ing and capering. Hard on their 
heels came a herd of furious ele- 
phants, three, four, seven — nine 
in all, one old bull, two young 
ones, four cows and two calves, 
distraught, angry, goaded beyond 
bearing. The fleeing warriors sepa- 
rated, two to the right, two to the 
left, sprinted to and disappeared in 
the crowds waiting there. 

The big bull trumpeted shrilly, 
wheeled, and charged to the right, 
only to face nearly two hundred 
shrieking, capering people. He 
swerved away, his momentum car- 
rying him along the rock wall and 
to the second opening, where he 
met the same startling cacophony. 
The other elephants, all but one 
young bull and one of the calves, 
thundered along behind him, and 
when he drew up as if to wheel and 
attack the second group, he was 
pounded and pressed from behind 
by his fellows. 

By now quite out of his great 
fearless placid mind, he put up his 
trunk, turned his mighty shoulders 
against those who pressed him, and 
found himself glaring at this noisy, 
shining thing in the center of the 
clearing. 

He shrieked and made for it, 
followed by the bellowing herd. 
The noisy, shining thing moved 
on its endless treads, but not swift- 
ly enough, nor far enough, nor in 



enough places at once to avoid the 
tons of hysteria which struck it. 
The elephants tore off its howling 
head and its neck, in three succes- 
sive broken bits, and shouldered it 
over on its side and then on its 
back. The howling stopped with 
deafening suddenness when the 
head came off, but the tracks kept 
treading air for minutes. 

"C 1 LEPHANTS were used in Ber- 
■“ lin, too, on the machine which 
landed in the park near the famous 
zoo, though this was a more dis- 
ciplined performance by trained 
animals who did exactly as they 
were told. 

In China, a projector squatted in 
a cleft in the mountains, under a 
railroad trestle, and began hooting 
into the wind. An old nomad with 
arthritis hobbled out of the rocks 
and pulled two spikes, shifted one 
rail. A half-mile down the track, 
the engineer and fireman of a loco- 
motive pulling a combination pas- 
senger-freight train with over four 
hundred people aboard wordlessly 
left their posts, climbed back over 
the tender and uncoupled the loco- 
motive from the first car. There 
was, on the instant, a man at every 
handwheel on the train. It coasted 
to a stop, while far ahead the loco- 
motive thundered over the edge 
of the trestle and was crushing the 
projector before the alien machine 
could move a foot. 

In Baffin Land, a group of Es- 



TO MARRY MEDUSA

kimo hunters stood transfixed, 
watching a projector squatting 
comfortably on mounded and im- 
passable pack ice and, in the crisp 
air, blaring its message across the 
wastes to the ears of four and pos- 
sibly five widely scattered settle- 
ments. The hunters had not long 
to wait; high above the atmos- 
phere, a mighty Atlas missile ap- 
proached, and, while still well be- 
low their horizon, released a com- 
paratively tiny sliver, the redoubt- 
able Hawk. 

The little Hawk came shrieking 
out of the upper, air, made a wide 
half-circle to kill some of its excess 
velocity, and then zeroed in on the 
projector with the kind of accuracy 
the old-time Navy bombardiers 
would brag about: “I dropped it 
right down his stack.” 

From then on, missiles got most 
of the projectors, though, in 
crowded areas, other means were 
found. In Bombay, a projector 
took its greatest toll — one hun- 
dred and thirty-six, when a mob 
simply overran one of the ma- 
chines and tore it to pieces with 
their bare hands. And, in Rome, 
one man dispatched four of them 
and came out of it unscathed. 

One man? 

Unscathed? 

A boy, rather, walking along the 
elevated section of the new high- 
way over the hills just north of 
Rome, who paused for not more 
than three seconds in his steady 



walk, then wordlessly turned and 
entered the Lagonda which drifted 
up to the curb just then. It was 
driven by a bright-eyed young 
woman, not excessively pretty, but 
of that unusual pure Italian type 
with pale red hair and green eyes. 
She had nothing to say, but drove 
the overpowered, scalded-cat La- 
gonda with a light touch and a 
sure hand. 

As if on some unseen cue, the 
boy opened the door, slipped out 
on the running board, and inched 
forward to lodge himself firmly be- 
tween the hood and the flaring fen- 
der, his knee hooked over the 
bracket which supports the great 
moon of a headlight. 

T) ENT against the wind of their 
speed, he unclamped his arm 
from the violin case he had been 
clutching all this while, opened it 
and took out the violin, letting the 
case flap away like a misshapen 
bat. Stolidly he broke the violin in 
two, separating neck from sound- 
box, and with his teeth pulled the 
four pegs, freeing the strings. He 
let the soundbox flutter off and 
splinter on the steel-bound curb, 
and with the fingerboard of the 
violin in his hand, its curled scroll 
uppermost, he unhooked his knee 
from the headlight brace and got 
his free hand on it instead. There 
he crouched, slit-eyed. 

As the elevated road swept in 
a broad curve to the left, the girl 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tooled the car as far as she could 
into the left lane, then put on a 
burst of speed which made the boy 
Guido’s muscles crack, and shot 
diagonally across the road and up 
on the sidewalk at the right. At 
the last possible instant, she 
wrenched the wheel and swerved 
away from the hard teeth of the 
railings, and Guido sprang up 
and out, soaring high over the side- 
hill, hurtling through the air at 
nearly eighty kilometers per hour. 

For her velocity to the micro- 
second, for his altitude and tra- 
jectory to seven decimal places, 
the best computing minds on Earth 
had done their utmost, matching 
these factors to all the others: his 
height and weight and the strength 
of his legs, the fact that of all 
pedestrians in the area at the time, 
he alone should possess such an 
object as the neck and carven 
scroll of a violin, which, it hap- 
pened, was precisely the right size 
and curvature capable of disabling 
a vital membrane in the throat of 
the projectors at one blow; all 
matched with the observed trajec- 
tory of a descending sphere which 
carried, not one, but four pro- 
jectors, obviously to a place in the 
City of Seven Hills where, by 
landing at the same place and 
moving apart a minimal distance, 
they could blanket a maximum 
area and number of people. 

At the very peak of his parabola, 
and past it into the sharp descend- 



ing curve, his free arm and both 
legs snapped like a trap around 
the intertwined necks of the four 
projectors. They were bound so 
that their heads were one atop the 
other. Guido shinnied upward far 
enough to reach the topmost, and 
crammed his shaped and hardened 
club into its horn. He silenced it 
and, with three quick blows, the 
other three, striking the last just 
as the whole package touched 
Earth. 

The sphere began its bounce 
skyward angrily, but fouled in the 
coils of a giant steel-cored rope 
mat, one of those used to muffle 
blasting in built-up areas. The mat 
had been hung like a great cur- 
tain under the viaduct, and ar- 
ranged to fall out and down as the 
sphere dipped low. A cluster of 
silent, sweating people waiting 
there caught the comer ropes and 
instantly anchored the mat to gir- 
ders and concrete piers, and the 
sphere lunged and lunged upward 
until suddenly it began to grow 
hot and then fell leadenly to the 
ground. 

Guido helped take it apart to 
find out how it worked.

light: sky. Crash! A brighter, un- 
bearable flash of light on light, a 
sharp smell of burning chemicals, 
a choking cloud of dust and smoke 
and the patter-patter of falling 
debris. Confusion, bewilderment, 
disorientation and growing anger at 
the deprivation of a dream. 

The sharp command to every 
sentience, mechanical or not, on 
the entire hilltop: Get Gurlick out 
of here! 

A flash of silver overhead, then 
a strange overall sticky, pore-chok- 
ing sensation, like being coated 
with warm oil, and, underneath, 
the tom hill dwindles away. There 
are still hundreds of projectors 
left, row on row of them, but from 
the size of the terraces where they 
are parked, there must have been 
hundreds of thousands more. 

Crash! A half-dozen of the pro- 
jectors bulge skyward and fall 
back in shatters and shards. Look 
there, a flight of jets. See, two 
silver spheres, dodging, dancing; 
then the long curve of a seeking 
missile points one out, and the trail 
and the burst make a bright ball 
on a smoky string, painted across 
the sky. Crash! Crash! Even as the 
scarred hill disappears in swift dis- 
tance, the parked projectors can 
be seen bursting skyward, a dozen 
and a dozen and a score of them, 
pressing upward through the rain 
of pieces from those blasted a 
breath or a blink ago; and Cra— 

No, not crash this time, but a 



point, a porthole, a bay-window 
looking in to the core of hell, 
all the colors and all too bright, 
growing, growing, too, too big to 
be growing so fast, taking the hill- 
top, the hillside, the whole hill 
lost in the ball of brilliance. 

And for minutes afterward, hang- 
ing stickily by something invisible, 
frighteningly in midair under the 
silver sphere, but not feeling wind 
or acceleration or any of the im- 
possible turns as the sphere 
whizzes along low, hedge-hopping, 
ground-hugging, back-tracking and 
hovering to hide; for minutes and 
minutes afterward, through the 
drifting speckles of overdazzled 
eyeballs, the pastel column can be 
seen rising and rising flatheaded 
over the land, thousands and 
thousands of feet, building a roof 
with eaves, the eaves curling and 
curling out, or are they the grasp- 
ing fingers of rows and rows of 
what devils who have climbed up 
the inside of the spout, about to 
put up what hellish faces? 

“Bastits,” Gurlick whimpered, 
“tryin’ to atom-bomb me. You 
tell ’em who I am?” 

No response. The Medusa was 
calculating to capacity — to its 
immense, infinitely varied capacity. 
It had expected to succeed in uni- 
fying the mind of humanity. It had 
correctly predicted its certainty of 
success and the impossibility of 
failure. 

But success like this? 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



T IKE this: In the first forty min- 
utes, humanity destroyed sev- 
enty-one per cent of the projectors 
and forty-three per cent of the 
spheres. To do this, it used every- 
thing and anything that came to 
hand, regardless of the cost in 
lives or materiel: 

It put out its fire by smothering 
it with its mink coat. It killed its 
rattlesnake by hitting it with the 
baby. It moved, reactive and ac- 
curate and almost in reflex, like a 
man holding a burning stick, and 
as the heat increases near one fin- 
ger, it will release and withdraw 
and find another purchase while 
he thinks of other things. It threw 
a child into the drive of a projec- 
tor because he fit, and because he 
contained the right amount of the 
right grade of lubricant for just 
that purpose at just that time. It 
could understand in microseconds 
that the nearest thing to the exact 
necessary tool for tearing the 
throat out of a projector would be 
the neck and scroll of a violin. 

And like this: Beginning in 
the forty-first minute, humanity 
launched the first precision weapon 
against the projectors, having de- 
vised and produced a seeking 
mechanism which would infallibly 
find and destroy projectors (though 
they did not radiate in the electro- 
magnetic spectrum, not even infra- 
red) and then made it compact 
enough to cram into the warhead 
of a Hawk, and, further, applied 



the Hawk to the powerful Atlas. 

And this was only the first. 

In the fifty-second minute — 
that is, less than an hour after the 
Medusa pushed the button to unify 
the mind of Man — humanity was 
using hasty makeshifts of apalling 
efficiency, devices which reversed 
the steering commands of the pro- 
jectors (like the one which, under 
its own power, walked off the Hell 
Gate Bridge into eighty feet of 
water) and others that rebroad- 
cast the projectors’ signals 180° 
out of phase, nullifying them. 

At the ninety-minute mark, hu- 
manity was knocking out two of 
every three flying spheres it saw, 
not by accurate aiming (because 
as yet humanity couldn’t tool 
up to countermeasure inertialess 
turns at six miles per second) but 
by an ingenious application of the 
theory of random numbers, by 
which they placed proximity mis- 
siles where the sphere wasn’t but 
almost certainly would be — and 
all too often was. 

The Medusa had anticipated 
success. But to sum up: success 
like this? For hadn’t humanity 
stamped out every operable instru- 
ment of the Medusa’s invasion 
(save Gurlick, about whom they 
couldn’t know) in just two hours 
and eight minutes? 

This incredible species, unique- 
ly possessed of a defense against 
the Medusa (the Medusa still 
stubbornly insisted) in its instant,

total fragmentation at the invader’s 
first touch, seemed uniquely to pos- 
sess other qualities as well. It 
would be wise — more: it was im- 
perative — that Earth be brought 
into the fold where it would have 
to take orders. 

Hence — 

Gurlick. 

TT swept Gurlick back into its 
-*• confidence, told him that in 
spite of the abruptness of his awak- 
ening, he was now ready to go out 
on his own. It described to him 
his assignment, which made Gur- 
lick snicker like an eight-year-old 
behind the barn, and assured him 
that it would set up for him the 
most perfect opportunity its mighty 
computers could devise. Speed, 
however, was of the essence — 
which was all right with Gurlick, 
who spat on his hands and made 
cluck-cluck noises from his back 
teeth and wrinkled up half his 
face with an obscene wink, and 
snickered again to show his wil- 
lingness. 

The sphere hovered now at tree- 
top level over heavily wooded 
ground, keeping out of sight while 
awaiting the alien computation of 
the best conceivable circumstances 
for Gurlick’s project This might 
well have proved lengthy, based 
as it was Gurlick’s partial, mis- 
taken, romantic, deluded and 
downright pornographic informa- 
tion, and might even have supplied 



some highly amusing conclusions, 
since they would have been based 
on logic, and Gurlick’s most cer- 
tainly were not. 

These diverting computations 
were lost, however, and lost for- 
ever when the sphere dropped diz- 
zyingly, released Gurlick so ab- 
ruptly that he tumbled, and in- 
formed him that he was on his 
own — the sphere had been de- 
tected. 

Growling and grumbling, Gur- 
lick sprawled under the trees and 
watched the sphere bullet upward 
and away, and a moment later, 
the appearance of a Hawk, or 
rather its trail, scoring the sky 
in a swift reach like the spread of 
a strain-crack in window glass. 

He did not see the inevitable, 
but heard it in due course, the 
faint distant thump against the 
roof of the world which marked 
the end of the sphere’s existence— 
and very probably the end of all 
the Medusa’s artifacts on Earth. 

He said an unprintable syllable, 
rolled over and eyed the wood- 
lands with disfavor. This wasn’t 
going to be like flying over it like 
a bug over a carpet, with some 
bigbrain doing all your thinking 
for you. On the other hand . 
this was the payoff. This was 
where Gurlick got his — where at 
long last he could strike back at 
a whole world full of bastits. 

He got to his feet and began 
walking.

ganism, mankind, as never before, 
I am I as never before. When 
Man has demands on me, I am 
totally dedicated to Man’s pur- 
pose. Otherwise, within the wide, 
wide limits of mankind’s best in- 
terests, I am as never before a 
free agent; I am I to a greater 



degree, and with less obstruction 
from within and without, than ever 
before possible. 

For gone, gone altogether, are 
individual man’s hosts of pests and 
devils, which in strange combina- 
tions have plagued us all in the 
past : the They - don’t - want - me 
devil, the Suppose-they-find-out 
devil, the twin imps of They-are- 
lying-to-me and They-are-trying- 
to-cheat-me; gone, gone is I’m- 
afraid-to-try, and They-won’t-let- 
me, and I-couldn’t-be-loved-if-they- 
knew. 

Along with the imps and devils, 
other things disappeared — things 
regarded throughout human his- 
tory as basic, thematic, keys to the 
structures of lives and cultures. 

Now if a real thing should dis- 
appear, a rock or a tree or a hand- 
ful of water, there will be thunder 
and a wind and other violence, de- 
pending upon what form the van- 
ished mass owned. Or if a great 
man disappears, there is almighty 
confusion in the rush to fill the 
vacuum of his functions. 

But the things which disap- 
peared now proved their unreality 
by the unruffled silence in which 
they disappeared. Tariffs, taxes, 
boundaries and frontiers, hatred 
and suspicion of humans by hu- 
mans, and language itself (except 
as part of an art) with all the dif- 
ficulties of communication between 
languages and within them. 

In short, removed now was man-

kind’s cess-gland, the secretions of 
which had poisoned its body since 
it was born, distorting decencies 
like survival and love into greed 
and lust, turning Achievement (“I 
have built”) into Position (“I have 
power”). 

QO much for humanity’s new 
^ state-of-being. As to its abili- 
ties, they were simply based, 
straightforward. There are always 
many ways to accomplish any- 
thing, but only one of them is 
really best. Which of them is best 
— that is the source of all argu- 
ment on the production of any- 
thing, the creator of factions 
among the designers, and the first 
enemy of speed and efficiency. 

But when humanity became a 
hive and needed something — as, 
for example, the adaptation of the 
swift hunting missile Hawk to the 
giant carrier Atlas — the device 
was produced without considera- 
tions of pride or profit, without 
waste motion, and without inter- 
personal friction of any kind. The 
decision was made, the job was 
done. 

In those heady first moments, 
anything and everything available 
was used — but with precision. 
Later (by minutes) fewer ingen- 
ious stopgaps were used, more per- 
fect tools were shaped from the 
materials at hand. And still later 
(by hours) there was full produc- 
tion of new designs. Mankind now 



used exactly the right tool for the 
jobs it had to do . 

And within it, each individual 
flowered, finding freedoms to be, 
to act, to take enrichment and 
pleasure as never before. 

What were the things that 
Dimity (Salome?) Carmichael 
had always needed, wanted to do? 
She could do them now. 

An Italian boy, Guido, packed 
taut with talent, awaited the ar- 
rival of the greatest living violinist 
from behind a now-collapsed Iron 
Curtain; they would hereafter 
spend their lives and do their 
work together. 

The parents of a small stiff boy 
named Henry contemplated, as 
all the world contemplated, what 
had happened to him and why, 
and how totally impossible it would 
be for such a thing ever to happen 
again. Sacrifice there must be from 
time to time, even now; but never 
again a useless one. Everyone now 
knew, as if in personal memory, 
how fiercely Henry had wanted to 
live in that flash of agony which 
had eclipsed him. 

All Earth shared the two kinds 
of religious experience discovered 
by the Africans Mbala and Nuyu, 
wherein one had become confirmed 
in his faith and the other had 
found it. What, specifically, had 
brought to them it was of no signifi- 
cance; the fact of their devotion 
was the important thing to be 
shared, for it is in the finest nature

of humanity to worship, fight it as 
he sometimes may. The Universe 
being what it is, there is always 
plus ultra, plus ultra — powers 
and patterns beyond understand- 
ing, and more beyond these when 
these are understood. Out there 
is the call to which faith is the 
natural response and worship the 
natural approach. 

Such was humanity when it be- 
came a hive — a beautiful entity, 
balanced and fine; self-sufficient 
and wondrously alive. A pity, in 
a way, that such a work of art was 
to exist in this form for so brief 
a time . 



Z"' 1 URLICK, alone of humans in- 
sulated from the human hive, 
member of another, sensed none 
of this. Driven, hungry through a 
whole spectrum of appetites, full 
of resentment, he shuffled through 
the woods. He had been vaguely 
aware of the outskirts of a town 
not far from where the silver 
sphere had set him down. He 
would, he supposed, find what he 
wanted there, though wanting it 
was the only thing quite clear to 
him. How he was to get it was 
uncertain; but get it he must. 

He was aware of the presence 
within him of the Medusa, ob- 
serving, computing, but — not di- 
recting, cognizant as it was of the 
fact that the fine details of such 
an operation must be left to the 
species itself. Had it had its spheres 



and other machines available, 
there might have been a great deal 
it could do to assist Gurlick. But 
now — he was on his own. 

He was in virgin forest, the in- 
terlocked foliage overhead dim- 
ming the mid-morning sunshine to 
an underwater green, and the foot- 
ing was good, there being little 
underbrush and a gentle down- 
slope. Gurlick gravitated downhill, 
knowing he would encounter a 
path or a road sooner or later, and 
monotonously cursed his empty 
stomach, his aching feet, and his 
enemies. 

He heard voices. 

He stopped, shrank back against 
a treetrunk, and peered. For a 
moment, he could detect nothing, 
and then, off to the right, he heard 
a sudden musical laugh. He looked 
toward the sound and saw a brief 
motion of something blue. He 
came out of hiding and, scuttling 
clumsily from tree to tree, went to 
investigate. 

There were three of them, girls 
in their mid-teens, dressed in hal- 
ters and shorts, giggling over the 
chore of building a fire in a small 
clearing. They had a string of fish, 
pike and lake trout, and a frying 
pan, and seemed completely and 
hilariously preoccupied. 

Gurlick, from a vantage point 
above them, chewed on his lower 
lip and wondered what to do. He 
had no delusions about approach- 
ing openly and sweet-talking his

way into their circle. It would be 
far wiser, he knew, to slip away 
and go looking elsewhere, for some- 
thing surer, safer. On the other 
hand . 

He heard the crackle of bacon 
fat as one of the girls dropped the 
tender slivers into the frying pan. 
He looked at the three lithe young 
bodies, and at the waiting string 
of fish, half of which were scaled 
and beheaded, and quietly moaned. 
There was too much of what was 
wanted down there for him to turn 
his back. 

Then a curl of fragrance from 
the bacon reached him and top- 
pled his reason. He rose from his 
crouch and in three bounds was 
down the slope and in their midst, 
moaning and slavering. One of the 
youngsters bounded away to the 
right, one to the left. The third 
fell under his hands, shrieking. 

“Now you jus’ be still,” he 
panted, trying to hold his victim, 
trying to protect himself against 
her hysterical slappings, writhings, 
clawings. “I ain’t goin’ to hurt you 
if you jus’— uh!” 

TIE was bowled right off his 
feet by one of the escapees, 
who had returned at a dead run 
and crashed him with a hard shoul- 
der. He rolled over and found him- 
self staring up at the second girl 
who had run away, as she stood 
over him with a stone the size of a 
grapefruit raised in both hands. 



She brought it down; it hit Gurlick 
on the left cheekbone and the 
bridge of his nose, and filled the 
world with stars and brilliant tat- 
ters of pain. 

He fell back, wagging his head, 
pawing at his face, trying to get 
some vision back and kick away 
the sick dizziness, and when at 
last he could see again, he was 
alone with the campfire, the frying 
pan, the string of fish. 

“Li’l bastits,” he growled, hold- 
ing his face. He looked at his 
hands, on which were flecks of his 
own blood, swore, turned in a 
circle as if to find and pursue them, 
and then squatted before the fire, 
reached for two cleaned fish and 
dropped them hissing into the pan. 

Well, he’d got that much out 
of it, anyway. 

He had eaten four of the fish 
and had two more cooking when 
he heard voices again, a man’s 
deep “Which way now? Over 
here?” and a girl’s answer, “Yes, 
where the smoke’s coming from.” 

Jailbait ... of course, of course 
they’d have gone for help! Gurlick 
cursed them all and lumbered 
downslope, away from the sound 
of voices. Boy, he’d messed up, 
but good. The whole hillside would 
be crawling with people hunting 
him. He had to get out of here. 

He moved as cautiously as he 
could, quite sure he was being 
watched by hundreds of eyes, yet 
seeing no one until he glimpsed

two men off to his left and below 
him. One had binoculars on a strap 
around his neck, the other a shot- 
gun. 

Gurlick, faint with terror, 
slumped down between a tree- 
trunk and a rock, and cowered 
there until he could hear their 
voices, and while he heard them, 
and after he heard them, with 
their curt certain syllables and 
their cold lack of mercy. 

When all was quite quiet again, 
he rose, and at that moment be- 
came aware of an aircraft sound. 
It approached rapidly, and he 
dropped back into his hiding place, 
trembling, and peeped up at the 
glittering patches of blue in the 
leafy roof. The machine flew direct- 
ly overhead, low, too slowly — a 
helicopter. He heard it thrashing 
the air off to the north, down- 
hill from him, and for a while he 
could not judge if it was going or 
coming or simply circling down 
there. 

In his pride, he was convinced 
that its business was Gurlick and 
only Gurlick, and in his ignorance 
he was certain it had seen him 
through the thick cover. 

IT went away at last and the 
forest returned to its murmur- 
ing silence. He heard a faint shout 
behind and above him, and scut- 
tled from cover and away from 
the sound. Pausing for breath, he 
caught another glimpse of the man 



with the shotgun off to his left, 
and escaped to the right and down. 

And, thus pursued and herded, 
he came to the water’s edge. 

There was a dirt path there and 
no one in sight; and it was warm 
and sunny and peaceful. Slowly, 
Gurlick’s panic subsided and, as 
he walked along the path, there 
was a deep throb of anticipation 
within him. He’d gotten away 
clean; and had outdistanced his 
enemies and now, enemies, beware! 

The path curved closer to the 
bank of the lake. Alders stood 
thick here, and there was the smell 
of moss. The path turned and the 
shade was briefly darker here, at 
the verge of the floods of gold 
over the water. And there by the 
path it lay, the little pile of fabric, 
bright red, shiny black, filmy white 
with edges iced with lace . 

Gurlick stopped walking, stopped 
breathing until his chest hint. Then 
he moved slowly past this in- 
credible, impossible consolidation 
of his dream, and went to the 
bushes at the water’s edge. 

She was out there — she. 

He made a sharp wordless sound 
and stood forward, away from the 
bushes. She turned in the water 
and stared at him, her eyes round. 

Emancipated now, free to be 
what she had always wished to be, 
and to do what she needed to do 
without fear or hesitation; swim- 
ming naked in the sun, sure and 
fearless, shameless; utterly oriented

within herself and herself within 
the matrix of humanity and all 
its known data, Salome Carmichael 
stood up in the water, under the 
sun, and said, “Hello, Handsome.” 

S O ended humanity within its 
planetary limits; so ended the 
self-contained, self-aware species- 
hive which had for such a brief 
time been able to feel, to the ends 
of its world, its multifarious self. 
The end came some hours after 
the helicopter — the same one 
which had set her down by the 
pond — had come for Salome Car- 
michael, which it had the instant 
Gurlick quit the scene. Gurlick had 
seen it, from where he crouched 
guiltily in the bushes. After it had 
gone away, he slowly climbed to 
his feet and made his way back 
to the pond. He hunkered down 
with his back to a tree and re- 
garded the scene unwinkingly. 

It had been right there, on the 
moss. 

Over there had lain the pretty 
little heap of clothes, so clean, so 
soft, so very red, shiny black, the 
white so pretty. The strangest 
thing that had ever happened to 
him in his whole life had hap- 
pened here, stranger than the com- 
ing of the Medusa, stranger than 
the unpeopled factory back there 
in the mountains, stranger even 
than the overwhelming fact of this 
place, of her being here, of the 
unbelievable coincidence of it all 



with his dream. And that strangest 
thing of all was that once, when 
she was here, she had cried out, 
and he had then been gentle. 

He had been gentle with all his 
heart and mind and body, for a 
brief while flooded, melted, swept 
away by gentleness. No wrinkled 
raisin from out of space, no con- 
cept like the existence of a single 
living thing so large it permeated 
two galaxies and part of a third, 
could be so shockingly alien to 
him, everything he was and had 
ever been, as this rush of gentle- 
ness. 

Its microscopic seed must have 
lain encysted within him all his 
life, never encountering a single 
thing, large or small, which could 
warm it to germination. Now it 
had burst open, burst him open, 
and he was shocked, shaken, 
macerated as never before in his 
bruised existence. 

He crouched against the tree 
and regarded the moss, and the 
lake, and the place where the red 
and the black and the lace had 
lain, and wondered why he had 
run away. He wondered how he 
could have let her go. The gentle- 
ness was consuming him even now 
. he had to find somewhere to 
put it down, but there wouldn’t 
be anyone else, anyone or any- 
thing, for him to be gentle to, any- 
where in the world. 

He began to cry. Gurlick had 
always wept easily, his facile tears 



TO MARRY MEDUSA

his only outlet for fear, and anger, 
and humiliation, and spite. This, 
however, was different. This was 
very difficult to do, painful in the 
extreme, and impossible to stop 
until he was racked, wrung out, 
exhausted. It tumbled him over 
and left him groveling on the moss. 
Then he slept, abruptly, his 
whipped consciousness fleeing away 
to the dark. 

W HAT can travel faster than 
light? 

Stand here by me, friend, on 
this hillside, under the black and 
freckled sky. Which stars do you 
know — Polaris? Good. And the 
bright one yonder, that’s Sirius. 
Look at them now: at Polaris, at 
Sirius. Quickly now: Polaris, Sirius. 
And again: Sirius, Polaris. 

How far apart are they? It says 
in the book, thousands of light- 
years. How many? Too many: 
never mind. But how long does 
it take you to flick your gaze from 
one to the other and back? A sec- 
ond? A half-second next time, then 
a tenth? You can’t say that 
nothing, absolutely nothing, has 
traveled between the two. Your 
vision has: your attention has. 

You now understand, you have 
the rudiments of understanding 
what it is to flick a part of yourself 
from star to star, just as (given the 
skill) you may shift from soul to 
soul. 

With such a shift, down such 



a path, came the Medusa at the 
instant of its marriage to humanity. 
In all the history of humanity, the 
one instant (save death) of most 
significance is the instant of syn- 
gamy, the moment of penetration 
by the sperm of the ovum. Yet al- 
most never is there a heralding of 
this instant, nor a sign: it comes 
to pass in silence and darkness, 
and no one ever knows but the 
mindless flecks of complex jelly 
directly involved. 

Not so now; and never before, 
and never again would marriage 
occur with such explosion. A micro- 
second after that melding, Gur- 
lick’s altered seed to the welcom- 
ing ovum of a human, the Medusa 
of space shot down its contacting 
thread, an unerring harpoon car- 
rying a line to itself, and all of its 
Self following in the line, ready to 
reach and fill humanity, make of 
it a pseudopod, the newest mem- 
ber of its sprawling corpus. 

But if the Medusa’s bolt can 
be likened to a harpoon, then it 
can be said that the uprushing 
flood it met was like a volcano. 
The Medusa had not a micro- 
microsecond in which to realize 
what had happened to it. It did not 
die; it was not killed any more 
than humanity would have been 
killed had the Medusa’s plan been 
realized. Humanity would have 
become a “person” of tire illimit- 
able creature. 

But now .

sciousness, blocked as it was by 
the thought-lines of the Medusa. 

These lines, however, were open 
still, and when humanity became 
Medusa, it flooded down to Gur- 
lick and made him welcome. 
Come! it called, and whirled him 
up and outward, showing and shar- 
ing its joy and strength and pride, 
showering him with wonders of a 
thousand elsewheres and a hun- 
dred heres; it showed him how 
to laugh at the most rarefied tech- 
nician’s joke and how to feel the 
structure of sestinae and sonnets, 
of bridges and Bach. It spoke to 
him saying We and granting him 
the right to regard it all and say I. 

And more: he had been prom- 
ised a kingship, and now he had 
it, for all this sentient immensity 
acknowledged to him its debt, and 
let him but make the phantom of 
a wish of a thought, and his de- 
sires would be fulfilled. 

And it was at this that humanity 
swirled and steadied, perplexed. 
For Gurlick, numb and passive as 
he tossed like a chip on their ocean 
of wonders, had a wish, and had it, 
and had it. 

True, none of this could have 
come about without him. This re- 
sult could not have been with any- 
one else in his place, so — true 
— enough — he was owed a debt. 
Pay it then. 



Pay the debt; you do not re- 
ward a catalyst by changing it, the 
unchanging, into something else. 
So — take away hunger and pover- 
ty (of body and soul), deprivation 
and discomfort gnd humiliation, 
and you take away the very core 
of his being — his sole claim to 
superiority. 

Don’t ask him to look out among 
the stars and join in the revelries 
of giants. Don’t thank him, don’t 
treat him, and above all, do not 
take away from him his reasons 
to hate: they have become his life. 

So they paid him, meticulously 
to the specifications he himself 
(though all unknowing) set up. 

And as long as he lived, there 
would be a city comer holding 
drab streets and fumes, suddenly 
sullen pedestrians and careless, 
dangerous aimers of trucks and 
cabs; obligingly moist unbearable 
heat and bitter cold; and bars 
where Gurlick could go and put 
in his head, whining for a drink, 
and bartenders would obediently 
send him out into the wet with his 
hatred, back to a wrecked truck 
in a junkyard where he might lie 
in the dark and dream that dream 
of his. 

“Bastits,” Gurlick would mutter 
in the dark, hating . happy. 
“Lousy bastits.”

lyTOW, instead, humanity became 

' the creature; flooded it, filled 
it to its furthermost crannies, 
drenched its most remote cells 
with the Self of humankind. Die? 
Never that; the Medusa was alive 
as never before, with a new and 
different kind of life, in which its 
slaves were freed but its motiva- 
tions unified; where the individual 
was courted and honored and 
brought special nutrients, body and 
mind, and where, freely, “want to” 
forever replaced “must.” 

And all for want of a datum: 
that intelligence might exist in in- 
dividuals, and that dissociated in- 
dividuals might cooperate and yet 
not be a hive. For there is no 
structure on Earth which could not 
have been built by rats, were the 
rats centrally directed and proper- 
ly motivated. 

How could the Medusa have 
known? Thousands upon thou- 
sands of species and cultures 
throughout the galaxies have tech- 
nological progress as advanced as 
that of Earth, and are yet com- 
posed of individuals no more high- 
ly evolved than termites, lemurs 
or shrews. What slightest hint was 
there for the Medusa that a hive- 
humanity would be a different 
thing than a super-rat? 

Humanity had passed the bar- 
riers of language and of individual 
isolation on its planet. It passed the 
barriers of species now, and of iso- 
lation in its cosmos. As available 



to Guido as the faith of Mbala now 
became the crystal symphonies of 
the black planets past Ophiuchus. 
Charlotte Dunsay, reaching across 
the world to her husband in Ho- 
bart, Tasmania, might share with 
him a triple sunrise in the hub 
of Orion’s great Nebula. 

As one man could share the 
being of another here on Earth, 
so both, and perhaps a small child 
with them, could fuse their inner 
selves with some ancient contem- 
plative mind leeched to the rocks 
in some roaring methane cataract, 
or soar with some insubstantial 
life-forms adrift where they were 
born in the high layers of some 
dense planet’s atmosphere. 

So ended mankind, to be born 
again as hive-humanity; so ended 
the hive of Earth to become star- 
man, the immeasurable, the limit- 
less, the growing; maker of music 
beyond music, poetry beyond 
words, and full of wonder, full of 
worship. 

CO too ended Gurlick, the iso- 
lated, alone among humankind 
denied membership in the fusion 
of humans, full of a steaming fog, 
aglow with his flickerings of hate 
and the soft shine of corruption, 
member of something other than 
humankind. For, while humanity 
had been able to read him (and 
his dream) and herd him through 
the forest to its fulfillment, it had 
never been able to reach his con-

OFFENSE 

Is this why history is so 

untidy ... it is being used 

as a social sewage system? 



Illustrated by MARTINEZ 



O NE minute Roykin was in 
the Web and it was begin- 
ning to vibrate and get hot. 
And then red lightnings flashed and 
crashed, and then he was naked, on 
dusty ground, under a pale winter 
sun. The wind was knifely cold. 

Roykin stood up and looked an- 
grily around. 

A hoarse voice shouted at him, a 
voice like Grillard’s voice, in a lan- 



guage he didn’t understand. Grillard 
had all of stuffy male wrath in his 
voice when he talked to Roykin, 
and so had this voice. 

But it was not Grillard. It was 
sobering. Roykin’s anger chilled as 
quickly as his body, for this was no 
place for anger. He looked around 
him and what he saw made him 
momentarily afraid. 

Bare dirt was underfoot. 



THIRD OFFENSE 



63 



A frozen sky was overhead. 

Low wooden barracks surrounded 
him. 

Nearby was a clot of naked men 
with doomed and opaque faces. 
They were looking at him. An irreg- 
ular crescent of men in brown uni- 
forms, splashed jagged black-and- 
white at the shoulders, surrounded 
them all. The uniformed men were 
looking at him too. 

Roykin thought anxiously: Curse 
Grillard, what sort of place is this? 

It was a cold place that stank 
with a thick, pungent stink of sweat 
and sickness. It was a lot worse than 
the galleys, Roykin admitted, and 
at the. time he had thought that 
there would never be anything 
worse. But that had been his first 
offense. Naturally this would be 
worse; Roykin could trust Grillard 
to see to that . 

A man in a brown uniform 
stepped forward and struck him on 
the head with an eighteen-inch club. 

The blow floored Roykin. 

XT E climbed to his feet with the 
merely tiresome sensation of 
physical pain filling his skull like a 
breath swelling a balloon. 

The man was standing over him 
still. There was no passion in his 
face, Roykin noticed. He looked at 
Roykin as a carpenter might look 
at a nailhead. Perhaps the nailhead 
would need another blow and per- 
haps not, but he wasn’t angry at the 
nail. 



Hurriedly, Roykin scrambled 
over to the knot of naked men. They 
marched off in the shivering cold. 
The man with the club looked emp- 
tily after. 

The line of bareskinned men 
passed a sign, with lettering on it 
that was hooked curlicues and strag- 
gling lines. Roykin couldn’t read it 
very well, partly because it wasn’t 
in his own language and partly be- 
cause, although the letters were 
Roykin’s familiar ABCs, they were 
more ornate than he was used to. 

But underneath the more compli- 
cated words was one simple one. He 
read it: 

BELSEN 

Roykin slept that night on a 
board floor, with cold air coming up 
between the cracks. 

The smell was appalling. It was a 
fetid slaughterhouse stench, like the 
hot steamy gusts from a rendering 
plant, but it wasn’t hot — it was cold 
as old ice. It was very difficult for 
Roykin to get to sleep, particularly 
because a baby was crying annoy- 
ingly near his ear. The baby wept 
and wept. 

Curse Grillard, Roykin thought 
in fatigue. His head still hurt badly 
and that was an inconvenience. 

Still ... it wasn’t so bad. Roykin 
had always been able to adjust him- 
self to whatever came along; it was 
the thing he prided himself on. At 
least he wasn’t pushing an eighteen- 
foot oar, as in the galleys; that was

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bad, but he had adjusted to that 
well enough, though it was work. 
Roykin didn’t like work. And they 
didn’t seem to care if the prisoners 
worked or not in this place, what- 
ever this place was, and that in itself 
was an improvement. Roykin curled 
up and set his mind to trying to go 
to sleep; but the crying baby both- 
ered him. 

Roykin propped himself up and 
looked around. 

There was no baby. It was a man, 
ancient as Methuselah’s father, with 
arms like pipestems and a face 
hacked out of dirty bone — no flesh, 
no softness, stretched rock-tight. 
And his eyes were closed and he 
was crying, crying. 

Roykin could think of nothing 
that he could do or wanted to do 
about it, and accordingly returned 
to the effort to go to sleep. But he 
remembered things drowsily : things 
from another place and time. Gril- 
lard, furiously angry, hissing into 
the microphone: “You don’t de- 
serve another chance, Roykin. 
You’ve had chance after chance, 
and what do you make of them?” 

“I don’t like your chances,” said 
Roykin. 

“The world doesn’t like you, Roy- 
kin! You’re antisocial. You’ve 
stolen. You’ve hurt people. What 
are we to do? Corrective school?” 

“I don’t like your school.” 

“All right. That leaves only one 
thing.” Bang came the gavel, and 
the microphone enlarged the sound 



flatly. “Second offense, thirty days. 
Take him away.” 

And the greasy-feelered police, 
sparkling blue from the ends of their 
sensors, wrapped themselves around 
Roykin and rolled him away to the 
Web. 

Roykin, remembering, fell asleep 
to dream of Grillard and — with 
fond contempt — of Zenomia, who 
had watched at the Web as he went 
and would be waiting at the Web as 
he returned. Joke on her. Joke on 
Grillard — great joke! 

For this to Grillard was punish- 
ment, designed to correct, this Web- 
borne transference to a place of 
punishment and pain. But Roykin 
had never been afraid of pain; and 
to Roykin pain had never been pun- 
ishment. 

r I ’HERE was no more parading 
around naked, though the filth 
that was in the clothing Roykin re- 
ceived was worse than bare skin. 
Roykin needed someone to talk to, 
and in time found someone — no, 
not one of his own people, but what 
was called a Spaniard. The lan- 
guage he spoke was not the inflected 
loan-worded Spanish Roykin was 
used to, but an earlier version; still, 
Roykin could make himself under- 
stood and could understand, though 
some of the words of the jailers 
were more familiar than the Span- 
ish. And he had found out where he 
was. 

Belsen? A concentration camp,

explained his informant. For crim- 
inals, Jews, homosexuals, aliens and 
the politically suspect. For what? 
Haltingly, the Spaniard tried to ex- 
plain each of the terms, but Roykin 
lacked patience for instruction in 
the mores of this time. Where? he 
asked. Germany. 

Where was Germany? 

His informant began to look wor- 
ried, particularly as one of the men 
in brown uniforms was wandering 
near. Silently the man crept away. 

But Roykin at last remembered; 
yes, Germany — he had heard of it. 
Things fell into place. He discov- 
ered that the gauntlet he had run, 
naked, was called “medical inspec- 
tion” and, for a while, Roykin 
thought wonderingly of the spec- 
trum-readers of his own time, that 
diagnosed physical state by elec- 
tronic measurement. 

But Roykin understood these 
matters: this was a place where 
things were not called by proper 
names; it was a place where things 
were concealed in part for purposes 
of security and in part so that those 
who were here should lack even the 
assurance of knowing what was in 
store for them . and should there- 
fore suspect and fear everything. 
Roykin determined to remember 
that principle; it would be helpful 
when the thirty days were up. 

The men in brown uniforms put 
Roykin to work. 

He was taken to an open ditch 
where blank-faced men in filthy 



rags like his own were up-ending 
wheelbarrows of ash into the trough 
and others were striking the ash 
with great hammers. 

Roykin looked closer and saw 
what the hammers were for. Mixed 
in the ash were pieces of calcined 
bone; it was the task of the hammers 
to shatter them out of shape, per- 
haps so that the ash itself could be 
added anonymously to some farm- 
er’s soil, perhaps out of an instinct 
for neatness. 

Roykin rebelled. No, not at the 
cremated remains, for that was to be 
expected in a punishment time, but: 
“Work!” he cried, in the halting Ger- 
man he had begun to pick up. “I 
shall not work! I am not here for 
work!” 

“Halfs mahl,” said one of the 
men in brown uniforms standing by, 
and moved passionlessly to hit him 
in the face. 

Roykin felt his teeth crumble. He 
reeled to where he was ordered to 
go and stood for a moment, tasting 
the pain. It was an inconvenience 
again, he thought, appraising it; but 
not too bad, not too bad at all. 

Pain had never been punishment 
for Roykin, as has been said. Pain is 
only a tingle in the nerve endings, 
not different from touch or taste or 
chill; it is only the connotations of 
pain that make it feared. The pain 
of a knife rending through the flesh 
is only in part the message that the 
cut nerves send. In part it is also 
fear, and that the greater part — fear 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




THIRD OFFENSE 



67 





of death; fear of long slow healing 
aches; fear that it will never heal, 
that an arm or a leg may be lost or 
an eye go blind. Pain itself is not 
always feared — even by others than 
Roykin; the grueling pain of child- 
birth is more sought than evaded. 

From such fears as make pain in- 
supportable, Roykin, for good rea- 
son, was immune. To that degree, 
he was immune from pain; and this 
was what Grillard had not been able 
to learn. 

All the same, Roykin picked up 
his hammer and began to punish the 
calcined bone. 

TJOYKIN understood that there 
was danger here. 

Thirty days is not long, but it 
was up to him to survive the thirty 
days; it would be no court’s fault if 
he were killed first. And perhaps, he 
mused, it had even been Grillard’s 
wish that he should die here in this 
place, and thus the problem of Roy- 
kin should once and for all be solved. 
The thought amusing him, he 
laughed. He determined, then, to 
avoid the worst of the punishments 
these men offered. 

Of such punishments there were 
many. Around him was more than 
pain, pain multiplied to a pitch that 
raised it to another magnitude en- 
tirely. Roykin discovered that every 
person in this place was here be- 
cause it was desired that he die. 
Some were killed outright by blow 
or knife or gun. Some were starved. 



Some were placed in enormous gas 
chambers, stripped and extin- 
guished, and their corpses ransacked 
for dental fillings and for rings. 

Roykin thought, by the twentieth 
day, almost wistfully of the galleys. 

This was not the galleys. This 
was something different. Here the 
imprisoned were not commanded to 
work until they died. Here they 
were commanded to die. 

Roykin had to admit that it made 
a pattern and even that it had a cer- 
tain elegance. This was Early Ma- 
chine Age. There was no real need 
for human slaves, which inevitably 
made a difference in attitude toward 
the preservation of human life; the 
impulse to preserve life rested only 
on ethical considerations, not on the 
solid basis of conservation of usable 
property. There were, however, no 
ethical considerations in Belsen. 

It was a long stride from his tenth- 
century galleys, where his first of- 
fense had brought him, but it was 
not a stride upward. 

Still, he survived, though he grew 
quite thin. Twenty days. Thirty. 

And he felt the invisible Web 
wrapped, tight and burning, around 
him. The dying prisoner whom he 
had been robbing of a moldy piece 
of bread looked apathetically up at 
him, then wonderingly, then disap- 
peared. 

Roykin dropped a few inches 
onto a padded couch. 

Bright lights blazed around him. 
He was home. 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ENOMIA was waiting to greet 
^ him — of course. 

“Pfiu,” she said, wrinkling her 
nose. “Darling Roykin, I am here 
but — pfiu.” 

Roykin felt strong as a tiger. He 
fought his way free of the Web and 
kicked against the protecting bars. 
“I stink!” he exulted. “Ah, we all did, 
Zenomia, but I lived and the others 
didn’t You, there! Let me out of 
here.” 

Behind his glass panel, the Web 
operator silently disapproved, but 
he moved a hand and the bars that 
kept visitors from tangling with the 
Web dropped away. Roykin 
bounded out and clutched the girl. 

“We’ll get married again,” he 
planned. “I need a woman tonight. 
Now! You’ll do.” 

“Roykin,” she said, straining 
away, “please bathe. I’ll wait.” 

Roykin laughed and, walking 
lightly, stripped off his clothes and 
threw them at the Web operator. 
They struck the glass and left a 
mark. Roykin laughed again. 

He went surely to the dressing 
rooms on the other side of the door, 
for he remembered the way. Naked 
and laughing to himself, he passed 
unremembered faces, men and 
women who perhaps worked there, 
perhaps had business elsewhere in 
the building, perhaps had come to 
see what it was like — everyone 
knew about the Web, though only a 
few like Roykin would ever experi- 
ence it themselves. Or perhaps they 



had come to see Roykin! Some of 
the faces seemed to know him, for 
they whispered to each other. 

He laughed louder. Roykin! Roy- 
kin knew Roykin, too — it was a 
name that everyone should know! 

He was still laughing as the bath 
sprayed him, soaped him, rinsed 
him and dried him. 

“Love?” whispered the bath re- 
cording, its perfume sprays and 
powder jets cocked. “Sport? Sleep? 
What is your pleasure?” 

Roykin frowned. The mood for 
Zenomia had passed him. 

“Nothing,” he decided. “Just get 
me out of here.” 

Warm gusts of air wrapped them- 
selves obediently around him and 
the curtain slipped away. 

He stepped out and clothed him- 
self, while Zenomia waited lovingly. 
But he said grandly, “Not now. I 
will see you later, perhaps. Now I 
intend to visit with Grillard.” 

RILLARD’S house stood alone 
on stilts in six feet of water. 

“Hoy!” cried Roykin, waving at 
the house. “Come get me!” 

Obediently, the house unrolled a 
floating streamer from the door to 
the grassy bank where Roykin 
stood. He stepped on it and stood 
regally as it retracted to deposit him 
on the doorstep. 

A silvery voice recognized him 
and chimed, “Roykin, Roykin,” 
though he had never been there be- 
fore. 



THIRD OFFENSE 



69 



Trust Grillard, he thought — he 
hasn’t neglected to tell the house 
that I might appear. Roykin waited, 
tapping his foot. 

Grillard himself appeared. 

The handsome face, white-haloed, 
was dignified but uneasy. “What do 
you want, Roykin?” 

“I’m back, Grillard.” 

“I know you’re back. I signed the 
order for the Web.” 

Roykin pushed by him. “You 
signed the order that sent me there, 
too.” 

“I had no choice. What do you 
want?” 

Roykin walked on in and sat 
down, fingering little knickknacks 
on a table before him. “Chinese, 
Grillard?” he guessed, picking up a 
little figurine. It was quite heavy 
and dangerous. “It looks Chinese.” 
“Get out of here, Roykin.” 

Roykin considered. “No,” he de- 
cided, “I don’t want to do that. I 
thought I wanted Zenomia, but I 
didn’t want her either. I’m not sure 
what I do want. Is that amusing, 
Grillard?” 

Grillard peered fretfully out from 
the white whiskers that framed his 
face. He said uneasily: “I’m warn- 
ing you, Roykin. The next time will 
be your third offense, and that isn’t 
a matter of thirty days.” 

“What is?” asked Roykin dream- 
ily. “No, it wasn’t Zenomia I wanted, 
though she has taut breasts. It 
wasn’t a woman at all. I wanted to 
frighten someone.” 



“Get out of here!” 

“I may steal your Chinese figu- 
rine,” said Roykin, “or I may hit 
you with it. Perhaps I will pull out 
your whiskers. Have you a wife, 
Grillard? I don’t know, maybe I 
could violate her. I have learned 
these things, in thirty days with 
your help as well as elsewhere. I 
am grateful, I think.” 

“Roykin,” Grillard cried shrilly, 
“the third offense is — ” 

“Shut up, old man, and come 
here,” said Roykin, moving toward 
him, and he couldn’t afterward re- 
member what had come next. 

T>UT he remembered what hap- 
-■-* pened the next morning, oh, 
yes. 

Grillard, with a bit of surgeon’s 
plaster across his forehead, stood 
over him on the dais, scowling, and 
said into the microphone : “The di- 
agnosis is total dissociation, schizoid. 
Third offense. One week.” And then 
it was the Web again. 

Roykin leaped to his feet where 
the Web dropped him, very angry, 
for not even Zenomia had been 
there to see him go. (He thought, 
though he couldn’t remember for 
sure, that he had been to see her 
after striking Grillard. Also there 
had been something about a fire. 
Perhaps he had made her dislike 
him.) 

But he looked about him, and he 
was not so angry. This time they 
had let him keep his clothes, and 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



besides it was not cold. Oh, it was 
hot. Fools, he cried silently, very 
pleased. Only one week? 

But it might be an unpleasant 
week. 

Foul stenches smote his nose. He 
was standing calf-deep in thick 
black mud, and two sorry horses 
were straining to draw a wheeled 
wagon past him. The heat was ap- 
palling; the smell was awful; there 
were clouds of insects. (But only 
one week! he sang to himself.) 

“Hi!” he cried. “Hoy!” 

The man on the wagon shouted 
at him and whipped his horses. This 
angered Roykin and he leaped to 
the wagon — leaped and missed and 
came down half sprawling in the 
ugly mud. But he caught himself up 
again, laughing (only one week!), 
and climbed aboard. 

“Where am I, man?” he de- 
manded. “When is this?” 

The man snarled at him. 

“Man, tell me!” cried Roykin, 
and finally made himself under- 
stood. 

“Philadelphia?” repeated Roy- 
kin, trying to remember where that 
was. “And the year is seventeen 
hundred and ninety-three?” 

It made no sense, no sense at all. 
He swung off the wagon and let the 
carter flog his feeble beasts away. 
There were many like him; the road 
was packed. Overhead, a cloud- 
fogged sun steamed the earth gently, 
evoking every smell that the 
smeared soil was capable of. Seven- 



teen-ninety-three, thought Roykin, 
frowning. But what was 1793, that 
it should be a punishment? And for 
only one week? 

“Ware!” cried a voice strongly. 
‘Ware for the dead wagon!” 

And another wagon sloshed and 
slithered by; and it held a cargo of 
stickfigures in rags. There had been 
bodies like that in Belsen when 
Roykin took the task of cleaning 
out the gas rooms after a busy day’s 
extermination; but he had never 
thought to see them here. 

“Ware!” cried the dead-cart driv- 
er’s voice, passing away. “Ware for 
the victims of the yellow fever!” 

And Roykin stopped and looked 
around. 

It was a city in flight and he was 
in the middle of it. Half of Philadel- 
phia was on these roads, striving for 
the safety that lay outside the city 
— striving in vain for wherever they 
went they could not escape them- 
selves, and it was in themselves that 
the plague lay. 

Yellow fever! 

A NGRILY Roykin ran, slipping 
and falling, to a house and 
thundered at the door. A curtain 
quivered at an upper window, but 
the door remained barred. 

“Prophylaxis!” shouted Roykin. 
“An ampoule of antibiotic, quickly!” 
The window curtain quivered again 
to mock him, and then not even 
that. 

“I beg you!” shouted Roykin, 



THIRD OFFENSE

but no answer. And how could there 
be? he sobbed to himself. Seventeen 
hundred and ninety-three! Antibi- 
otics were nearly two centuries 
away, as far from reach as the 
Moon! 

He looked around him again, and 
the smell no longer mattered. It was 
filth that bred the fever, but the 
fever was grown now; the filth no 
longer mattered. 

Yellow fever. 

With horror, Roykin brushed the 



stinging insects from his skin. 

But they returned again, bringing 
their itch of death. 

There were wagons, there were 
roads, there were many ways of get- 
ting out of the city. 

But not in time. Roykin stood 
with the whining mosquitoes swarm- 
ing around his head, staring up at 
the uncaring sky. 

Third offense. 

One week.

HOW TO GET AROUND 
ON OTHER PLANETS 

By WILLY LEY 

T HE year will be around 
1985 A.D. 

Captain Sixtus E. Boyle, 
assisted by Navigator Roderich 
Meerschaum, has just put his ship 
down at latitude 6° 15' S. on 
Mars. What do they do next? 

Before landing, they had orbited 
Mars for several days in order to 
take detailed pictures of the sur- 
face in the equatorial regions so 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



73 



that they could decide on a suit- 
able spot for landing. The general 
instructions which they carried 
both on perma-paper and in their 
heads had been somewhat vague 
about the landing itself. They 
merely stated that the landing 
should be made near the Martian 
equator for reasons of tempera- 
tures. 

Near the equator, one could ex- 
pect reasonable temperatures dur- 
ing the day. The nights would be 
extremely cold, but that could not 
be helped. Far from the equator, 
it would be cold around the clock. 

In addition to the order to land 
near the equator, the instructions 
merely said that, “of course,” the 
landing place should be “in the 
proximity of interesting forma- 
tions.” Captain Boyle finally found 
a spot on the photographs which 
looked like smooth desert with a 
ridge of fairly high hills (rare on 
Mars) not too far away. There 
is also a “canal” nearby. On the 
pictures taken from the orbit 
around Mars, the formation did 
not look like a “canal,” nor like 
anything else for which there was 
an established name. 

But the charts drawn from a 
long distance — Earth, that is — in- 
sisted that it was a canal. Hence 
it was something to be investigated. 

Now the ship sits on the desert 
sand, undamaged. The ridge of 
hills is to the north, clearly visible, 
and it looks as if it were about five 



miles away. And the “canal,” what- 
ever it really is, must be to the 
east. It is not visible from the ship, 
but if they hit anywhere near the 
intended spot, it would be about 
twenty miles away. 

The captain decides that one 
does not explore well on an empty 
stomach, so the crew eats first 
There is a rest period of several 
hours, mostly for the purpose of 
getting used to gravity again. Then 
the captains assign watches and 
two men break out the ground 
car. 

T ET’S come back from the fu- 
ture and think about that 
ground car for Mars. How would 
you design ground transportation 
for such different conditions? 

But the first question might well 
be whether you really need a 
ground car. What’s wrong with 
walking? 

Of course one could walk on 
Mars. 

As has been mentioned, the day- 
time temperatures near the Mar- 
tian equator are bearable, even if 
highly extreme. In the morning, 
say, one hour after sunrise, it is 
still about forty below zero. An 
hour after noon, it is around seven- 
ty above zero. The tropics of Mars 
might better be called its “intem- 
perate zone,” but they do not rep- 
resent an impossible situation. Our 
own highland of Tibet is very 
nearly as bad; the temperature 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



does not go so low there during 
the night, but it climbs to around 
a hundred in daytime when the 
season is right. 

Air pressure is a somewhat dif- 
ferent story. The Martian atmos- 
phere, near the ground, has rough- 
ly the same pressure as our own 
atmosphere eleven miles up. This 
calls for a pressure suit, especially 
since the oxygen content seems to 
be near zero. Even if it were all 
oxygen, a man could not breathe 
at such a low pressure. The incon- 
venience of the pressure suit is 
more than compensated by the low 
gravity — a man will weigh pre- 
cisely 38 per cent of what he 
weighs on Earth. Which means 
that even a heavy suit, with oxygen 
bottles on the back and all kinds 
of hand tools dangling from the 
belt, will not produce full Earth 
weight for the explorer. 

So one could walk and the men 
will do it for short distances. But, 
for exploration, ground transpor- 
tation of some kind is needed. 
Specimens will have to be car- 
ried to the ship. Even if they are 
not heavy, they might be awk- 
ward to handle. 

The design of any kind of 
ground transportation is chiefly 
influenced by the nature of the 
ground. On Mars, there may be 
rocky ground in many places, 
rather rough. Much of it must be 
sandy desert. And in those areas 
which look dark when seen from 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Earth, there are likely to be salty 
marshes. For all these types of 
ground, wheels are not practical. 

HP HE first alternative that al- 
ways occurs to everybody, 
when wheels won’t do, is the cater- 
pillar tread. But it has its limita- 
tions too, and for Mars the best 
bet is indubitably the so-called 
“rolligon” — the barrel-shaped in- 
flated pillows developed for similar 
conditions on Earth. 

Rolligons produce fine traction 
on sand and do not sink in. They 
can tolerate very rough rocky 
ground and don’t shake up the 
driver in the process. They do well 
in marshes, and if the water should 
be too deep, they will float. They 
could be inflated on the spot with 
Martian atmosphere. It would 
take some time because the atmos- 
phere is so thin, but it can be com- 
pressed. 

The question of engine power is 
somewhat more complicated. It 
must not need air, for we have to 
go on the assumption that Mar- 
tian air will not sustain combus- 
tion, even when compressed to 
what we consider normal density. 
Right now we know three types 
of non-air-breathing engines. They 
are (1) the rocket, (2) the elec- 
tric motor and (3) the atomic 
reactor. 

Rocket power is useless for the 
conditions in question, because the 
ground vehicles must be able to

move very slowly, which is the 
one thing the rocket cannot do, at 
least not efficiently. The electric 
motor could provide almost any 
speed range desired, but it needs 
electric current. Of course, one 
might say that between 1958 and 
1985 somebody may invent an in- 
credibly efficient kind of storage 
battery. This is possible, but no- 
body can promise that somebody 
else will. 

As regards atomic reactors, we 
can’t really tell. Maybe it can be 
built small enough and light 
enough in time, but it would be 
hard to say when, and impossible 
to tell what other complications 



might go with a small reactor. 

It was pointed out several years 
ago — by Wemher von Braun — 
that a ground car for an airless 
planet or a planet with oxygen- 
less atmosphere could be turbine- 
powered, provided you pick the 
right fuel for the turbine. The right 
fuel would be hydrogen peroxide, 
H 2 0 2 . At ordinary temperatures, 
hydrogen peroxide is a liquid and 
it is quite safe if pure, or rather if 
it does not contain any other im- 
purities than water. When hydrogen 
peroxide is decomposed, the reaction 
proceeds according to the formula 

2 H 2 0 2 > 2 H 2 0 + 0 2 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Fig. 2: Diagram of two-stags hydrogen 
peroxide turbine 



It produces water and free oxy- 
gen. It also produces, which the 
equations fails to show, a large 
amount of heat. Hence the water 
appears in the form of steam, so 
that the product is a mixture of 
steam and hot oxygen. If there 
was water present in the hydrogen 
peroxide, this water is naturally 
heated into steam too. 

t’OR 80 per cent hydrogen per- 
oxide (the other 20 per cent be- 
ing water), all the water, both the 
20 per cent present and the water 
formed by the decomposition, will 
appear as steam with a tempera- 
ture of 870 degrees Fahrenheit. 
This steam can turn a turbine 
wheel. After it has passed through 
the turbine wheel, the steam will 
be too cool and too weak to do 
additional work. 

But the free oxygen that was 
formed by the decomposition and 
which is mixed with the steam has 
not done any work worth men-

tioning. So far, it has only in- 
creased the bulk somewhat. So, 
when it emerges from the turbine 
wheel, the steam-oxygen mixture 
enters a combustion chamber 
where some ordinary fuel like 
gasoline is injected. After it has 
burned, there is now a mixture of 
hot carbon dioxide from the com- 
bustion and reheated steam. This 
can drive a second turbine wheel. 

You have here what is known 
as a two-stage turbine which is 
not air-breathing, hence the ideal 
power plant for ground vehicles 
on airless or oxygenless planets. 

But by the time an expedition 
sets out for Mars, there will be an 
establishment of some sort on the 
Moon. Conditions on the surface 
of the Moon are like those on 
Mars, with much exaggeration. 

Where Mars has a thin atmos- 
phere, the Moon has just traces of 
gases, argon and so forth. (When 
I say traces, I mean traces, not 
just a highly attenuated gas.) 
Where Mars cools off to an esti- 
mated seventy degrees below zero 
during the night, the Moon cools 
to an estimated one hundred de- 
grees below zero during its night 
— if a night lasts two weeks, Earth 
time, the surface obviously has a 
better chance to radiate what heat 
it has into space. Likewise, the two- 
week day produces higher tem- 
peratures as it wears on slowly. 

Near the Moon’s equator, the 
temperature of the surface rock 



77 




Fig. 3: Moon car 



climbs to beyond the boiling point 
of water after a week of sunshine. 

As for condition of the lunar 
surface, one can only say that it 
is not Earthlike. The old ideas 
about the rock cracking into splin- 
ters because of the large tempera- 
ture span between day and night 
have been abandoned. Laboratory 
experiments have shown that rock 
will not crack if heated and cooled 
as slowly as in the course of a full 
lunar day. 

But the rock is being pounded 
by meteorites of all sizes. Meteo- 
rites of a size that form craters 
visible from Earth are naturally 
rare. But cosmic dust grains are 



very frequent. Each dust grain 
hitting lunar rock will produce 
several other dust grains. The cos- 
mic rays join in this work; they 
can, and in time will, break up 
the crystalline structure of the 
rock. 

HP HE overall result of these 
forces, acting over several mil- 
lion years of time, must be sharp 
rocks on the one hand and a layer 
of dust on the other. On an ex- 
posed vertical or very steep rock 
surface, the action of dust forma- 
tion must be continuous, since the 
rock flakes and dust produced will 
simply fall off and settle on the 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ground. On a flat area, however, 
the process must be self-limiting, 
because the dust formed will pro- 
tect the rock underneath against 
further meteorite and cosmic ray 
impacts. 

The question is how far the dust- 
forming process can be carried be- 
fore the dust becomes a protection. 
In the case of tiny metorites, 
roughly speaking of the size of 
sand grains, half an inch of dust 
will obviously be enough; the force 
of a new impact will not be car- 
ried through such a layer, but will 
be dissipated by throwing some 
of the existing dust around. Cos- 
mic rays could easily penetrate a 
half-inch layer of dust, however, 
and continue the process of the 
destruction of the rock. But this 
process must be self-limiting too, 



except that the required dust layer 
would have to be thicker. 

The general consensus right now 
is that the average depth of a dust 
layer might be about an inch, but 
that in some places a much deeper 
accumulation is easily possible. If 
dust is fine enough, it will behave 
more or less like water, and the 
English astronomer Thomas Gold 
— now in the United States — has 
suggested that the smoothness of 
the Moon’s maria is due to such 
a dust accumulation; the maria 
might be just large depressions 
filled with dust. 

The lunar surface, then, must 
be rocky with a dust layer on top, 
with possible accumulations of dust 
of great depth. 

The two-stage hydrogen per- 
oxide turbine would work on the

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



79 




Fig. 5: Prototype of Gyrobus under construction 



Moon too; the problem is what 
shape to give to the car. Most 
people who had to think about 
this problem — the first probably 
were illustrators of science fiction 
magazines — have simply settled 
for a tank as the most likely shape. 
Caterpillar treads can negotiate 
any kind of ground except ground 
that is very soft. They do not slip 
easily on gravel and can take con- 
siderable inclines. 

But so can rolligons, and if there 
are such dust-filled depressions, the 
rolligons would be safer. If a tank 
shape is picked, it might be prac- 
tical to have a tank push an ordi- 
nary heavy wheel ahead of itself 
on a boom. This would show 
where the ground is treacherous. 

Another likely shape for a Moon 
car would be a vehicle which 



simply has four wheels, but very 
large wheels, at least fifteen feet 
in diameter, with spiked rims. Such 
a vehicle could make much better 
speed on flat ground, and because 
of the large size of the wheels, 
there would be a high clearance 
between the body of the car and 
the ground, which would permit 
the passing of obstacles where a 
tank would have to lurch and 
clamber. 

T T is very likely that every Moon 
car would have to carry a 
sheet metal “shield” on vertical 
booms above its body. 

This shield would, in the first 
place, be a protection against too 
much sunlight. Since the Moon 
lacks anything that could reason- 
ably be called an atmosphere, the 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sunlight beating down on the lunar 
plains will be about three times as 
powerful as the tropical Sun on a 
clear day on Earth. 

In the second place, the shield 
would protect the body of the car 
against the fairly frequent dust 
particles coming from space with 
an average velocity of forty miles 
per second. They would cover the 
shield with nearly microscopic pits 
in the course of time, but they 
would not penetrate. 

But if there is a permanent 
base of some kind on the Moon, 
electricity would be a possible 
source of power for the Moon cars 
in the vicinity of the vase. The 
base would have an atomic reactor, 
a stationary power plant, for its 
own needs. Ground cars staying 
close to the base could run on re- 
chargeable batteries. 

The problem is that rechargeable 
batteries must not be exposed to a 
vacuum; they have to be pres- 



surized — that is, they must be 
located in the interior of the Moon 
car. This might be inconvenient, 
to say the least, and the designers 
therefore are likely to fall back 
on a trick used in Switzerland a 
few years ago. 

Engineers of the Swiss "firm of 
Oerlikon, at Oerlikon, near Zurich, 
built an experimental bus with a 
capacity of two dozen passengers. 
The wheels of this bus were driven 
by an ordinary three-phase elec- 
tric motor, but the current for the 
motor was not supplied by either 
overhead wire or by batteries. The 
energy was stored in a one-ton 
flywheel, measuring six feet in 
diameter and mounted in a hori- 
zontal position under the floor of 
the bus. 

To reduce friction, the Swiss en- 
gineers ran the flywheel in a sealed 
casing in a hydrogen atmosphere, 
but this is a minor point. 

A second three-phase motor was

81 



mounted on the flywheel shaft, and 
at the terminal, this motor brought 
the flywheel up to 3000 revolu- 
tions per minute, drawing current 
from the net When disconnected 
from the net, this motor became 
the generator, drawing mechanical 
energy from the flywheel and sup- 
plying electric current to the drive 
motor. 

After six miles of stop-and-go 
driving with a full passenger load, 
the flywheel had run down to 1500 
revolutions per minute. It then 
needed recharging, which could 
be done by means of power out- 
lets near passenger stops. The re- 
charging took two minutes. Then 
the bus was ready for another six- 
mile run, 

With a stationary power plant 
for the Moon base, such flywheel- 
driven vehicles would be very 



practical for routine runs on the 
lunar surface. If there are a num- 
ber of routine stops — say, lunar 
base, space port, astronomical ob- 
servatory and so forth — cables 
could be laid to those points from 
the power plant, with intermediate 
recharging points where necessary. 

The problem of getting around 
on other planets bears much re- 
semblance to quite a number of 
other detail problems in space 
travel. Engineers have very defi- 
nite ideas of how these problems 
could be solved. They could even 
build their solutions right now. 

But these solutions are not 
needed here on Earth. They are 
needed at the other end of the 
trip. 

And the first problem is to get 
to the other end of the trip.

THE TROUBLE WITH 

ELMO 

By DANIEL KEYES 

Said trouble being that Elmo 
had to live by his wits — and 
the one man who could outwit 
him couldn't do it wittingly! 



(•ffTjHE trouble with Elmo,” 
shouted Senator Ferdus, 
m as Private Busby helped 
him up into the copter, “is that he 
thinks he’s in business for him- 
self. He’s got to be made to un- 
derstand once and for all, Busby, 
that he’s only a computing ma- 
chine.” 



The thin, weary-looking private, 
haggard from lack of sleep, checked 
his controls and then peered 
through the early morning mist at 
the Washington Control Tower. 
Over the roar of the spinning 
rotors, he could hear the Senator 
still talking. 

“—Our government won’t toler-

ate it, Busby. Elmo has been pull- 
ing this for years just to excuse 
his staying alive. It won’t do, Bus- 
by. It’s blackmail. And I’m warn- 
ing you that it’s your job to—” 
The Senator paused as he looked 
around him. “Busby! Why aren’t 
we off the ground?” 

Private Busby pointed to the 
flickering red light on the control 
panel. “Waiting for an automatic 
beam to the other side of the Poto- 
mac.” 

“Busby, this is an emergency! 
For all I know, that mechanical 
monster is creating a new crisis at 
this very moment. Forget about 
the automatic. You can fly this 
thing without—” 

Busby took a deep breath and 
flicked the manual control switch, 
lifting the copter so quickly that 
the Senator lost the rest of his 
sentence. He glared suspiciously, 
waggled a fat but threatening 
finger. “Busby, I suspect you’re 
on Elmo’s side.” 

All the way to Computer Base, 
the Senator hammered away. 
“Mark my words, Busby. The peo- 
ple will not stand for the idea of 
spending twenty millions a year 
to service an Electronic Monitor 
that served its purpose more than 
fifteen years ago. You’d better 
come through with a demolition 
job this time. Not in twenty or 
thirty years, when Elmo decides 
he’s ready, but now, Busby, now! 
Otherwise, I’m afraid I’ll have to 

84 



recommend and insist upon your 
demotion.” 

J AKE Busby sighed, glanced 
down at the stitch marks that 
formed a chevron-shaped scar on 
his sleeve. 

“Senator,” he said, “fifteen years 
ago, when they assigned me to the 
Computer Demolition Squad, I 
was a master sergeant with a good 
record. And then the President is- 
sues the order to dismantle Elmo. 
The Secretary of Cybernetics 
hands it to the General of the 
Army, and down it comes through 
the old chain of command. Gen- 
erals, colonels, majors, until — 
where does it end up? Right here 
in the lap of Jake Busby. 

“And since then, Senator, I’ve 
had my ratings taken away from 
me, stripe by stripe, by every of- 
ficer who blames me for not get- 
ting his promotion. Senator—” Bus- 
by settled back and lit one of his 
favorite cigars, calmer now— “I’m 
sorry, but I’ve got no more stripes 
to give.” 

“What did you do before you 
volunteered to serve your coun- 
try?” 

“I didn’t volunteer, Senator. I 
was drafted. Before that, I ran a 
little business of my own. Busby’s 
Fixit Shop. And I used to go from 
house to house to find out if people 
needed anything fixed or—” 

“How old are you, Busby?” 
“Forty-six, Senator. And I had 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



this shop of mine all fitted out 
with lathes and—” 

“Then will you tell me,” snapped 
the Senator, “why the Army’s best 
computer technician, after twenty- 
two years in uniform and fifteen 
years of study and preparation, 
can’t get Elmo dismantled? My 
boy, don’t you see what you’re 
doing to your military career?” 
“Senator, I go through this every 
few years, but I’ll say it again: 
Elmo was built to solve the world’s 
major problems, and he can’t let 
himself be dismantled until he’s 
finished the job. Now you’ve got to 
admit that this cobalt radiation in 
the atmosphere was a threat to 
human survival.” 

“You know as well as I do, Bus- 
by— as well as any sixth-grade 
child knows by now — that Elmo 
caused the cobalt radiation in the 
first place.” 

Busby hunched angrily over the 
controls and stared ahead as he 
chewed his cigar. “The cobalt 
radiation was a byproduct of the 
solution to the world-famine threat. 
If not for Elmo—” 

“If not for your Elmo,” shouted 
the Senator, “there would have 
been no famine in the first place! 
It was a result of his solution to the 
storm cycle that he created to 
solve the problem of the five-year 
drought. Your Elmo solves one 
problem by creating a new one, 
just to keep us from putting him 
out of business. Well, you’d better 



make certain that this new solu- 
tion to the cobalt radiation hasn’t 
created any new problems. Other- 
wise, Busby, if they can’t break 
you any lower than a private, I’ll 
see that you’re court-martialed.” 

“But that’s not fair! Is it my 
Computer? Why do I have to be 
the goat? For crying out loud, 
I didn’t build him!” 

Senator Ferdus shrugged his 
shoulders and clasped his hands 
across his huge stomach. It was a 
final movement, like the passing of 
judgment. “Busby, the people are 
crying for blood. If it’s necessary, 
yours will have to do.” 

Busby stared at his cigar, 
chewed to shreds the way it al- 
ways was when he became upset. 
As they approached Computer 
Base, the dreadful question pound- 
ed into his mind as it had during 
all these months of waiting. Elmo 
had solved the radiation problem. 
What would the new problem be? 

t'ROM the air, the building 
housing Elmo at its center 
looked like a flat oval — the out- 
line shape of an egg. There, two 
hundred feet below ground level, 
the Electronic Monitor (known as 
Elmo for short) worked away at 
solving the problems of mankind. 
Busby lowered the copter gently 
— like a giant spider at the end 
of an invisible thread — to the 
roofport cradle. 

He wouldn’t be in this mess 



THE TROUBLE WITH ELMO 



85 



now, thought Busby, if they had 
let him out of the Army when his 
hitch was up. When it was discov- 
ered he had been trained for the 
special job of dismantling Elmo, 
someone declared him essential to 
the national defense. His discharge 
was pigeonholed and he was as- 
signed to demolition duty at Com- 
puter Base. 

He remembered his first years 
as an aide to the scientists who 
built Elmo. Under their instruc- 
tion, he got to know Elmo and be- 
came more interested in learning 
how an Electronic Monitor worked. 
He serviced Elmo’s parts with the 
loving care that a boy bestows on 
his first jalopy. He polished and 
oiled and tightened. And by the 
time the last of the scientists died, 
Busby knew more about Elmo 
than any man alive. 

And of course there were the 
feelings of guilt as he waited for 
Elmo to outlive his usefulness, 
waited for the final problem to be 
solved so he could perform his 
duty — as executioner. Thinking 
about that now, he caught himself 
up short. As much as he loved 
Elmo, he couldn’t deny the pecul- 
iar problems that were so unex- 
pected and suspicious. If Elmo was 
really creating them, as some peo- 
ple said, to stay alive, then Elmo 
was a menace. 

Inside the central vault, the 
Senator strode up and down with 
his hands clasped behind his back 

86 



while he surveyed his electronic 
nemesis. “All right, Busby, let’s get 
to it. I want to know exactly how 
Elmo has solved this problem. 
And then I want you to get right 
to work on the demolition job. 
Unless he’s pulled another fast one. 
And if he has, by gad—” 

“Oh, shut up!” It came out with- 
out Busby realizing it, but sud- 
denly he was glad he said it. 

Senator Ferdus’ mouth dropped 
open and he stared with bulging 
eyes beneath his thick white eye- 
brows. “I— I— how dare—” 

Busby swallowed and decided 
that, for once in his life, he would 
go all the way. “Now listen, Sena- 
tor. Outside this control room, you 
may be a big shot as the duly 
elected representative of suckers 
from Idaho, but down here you’re 
just my guest. I’m the only per- 
son who has unlimited clearance 
— even the President accepts that. 
If you keep your mouth shut, you 
can stay. If not, I’ll have to see 
that you’re escorted off Computer 
Base. As I mentioned before, Sen- 
ator,” he added, pointing to the 
stitch marks on his sleeve, “I have 
nothing to lose.” 

T IKE a gulping fish, the Senator 
opened and closed his mouth, 
finally shut it without saying any- 
thing. The transformation in Bus- 
by’s behavior was unmistakable; 
here he was undisputed authority. 
The Senator nodded a bright red 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



face and seated himself in a near- 
by chair. 

“Good, Senator. We understand 
each other. Now let’s find out 
what this is all about.” Busby 
reached over and threw the kine- 
scope tape-key that would present 
Elmo’s verbal and visual report. 

In the midst of the semi-circu- 
lar arc of computer banks, a video 
screen flashed into blinding white- 
ness. On both sides of this screen, 
oscilloscopes traced the electrical 
waves of sound. The voice boomed 
out, deep, hollow, clear. Elmo’s 
bass was slightly metallic, but to 
Busby it had the familiar tone of 
a friend. 

in answer to your move, 
Knight to Queen four, I move 
Bishop to Bishop five, check—” 
The video, now in focus, showed 
a closeup of Busby straining, deep 
in thought, over a chessboard. 

Busby fumbled with the tape- 
key. He had gone too far bapk on 
the kinescope recording. From the 
accusing look on the Senator’s 
face, Busby knew he would have a 
hard time explaining to a Senate 
investigating committee why he 
used a multi-billion-dollar Elec- 
tronic Monitor as a chess com- 
panion. 

Silently cursing himself, he 
found the position on the tapes 
that indicated the exact time he 
left the control room to pick up 
the Senator. Why hadn’t he re- 
membered to erase the chess-play- 



ing tapes as he always did? It was 
too late now. The Senator was 
making notes in his memo book. 

“Here we are,” said Busby, try- 
ing to appear lighthearted. “Now 
we’ll find out what’s going on.” 

At first there was no sound, 
and the video showed only the 
usual scanning of the various parts 
of the world. Then the picture 
halted and closed in on the scene 
of an open meadow just half a 
mile south of Computer Base. 
There appeared a circle of shim- 
mering orange light, like a spot- 
light, against the background of 
the uncut grass. 

The Senator leaned forward. 
“What’s that?” 

Before Busby could say he had 
no idea, they were confronted with 
the materialization of an enor- 
mous silver object that resembled 
an early twentieth-century gas-fuel 
tank. Peculiarly, this was crated 
with glowing yellow bands of un- 
dulating ribbonlike substance tied 
into a giant bow. 

Then a second appeared along- 
side the first. 

“Seems to be a tank of some 
kind,” suggested Busby. “Let’s cut 
Elmo in and ask him directly . 
Elmo, what’s going on? What are 
those things?” 

Q-V-Z-S. Electronic Monitor

two-nine, eight Contact made with 
intelligent life on Proxima Cen- 
tauri.” 



THE TROUBLE WITH ELMO

The Senator dropped his note- 
book as he jumped to his feet. 

“A matter-transmitter field has 
been established at Computer 
Base and surrounding neighbor- 
hood to serve as a receiving cen- 
ter for the shipment of gleep from 
the second planet of Proxima Cen- 
tauri. This liquid ore, when re- 
leased in the form of gases, will 
counteract the cobalt radiation in 
Terran atmosphere. All that re- 
mains is the payment for the twen- 
ty billion tuns of gleep as per our 
trade agreement.” 

r T , HE Senator screeched. “Trade 
agreement? Busby, what is 
this?” 

“Elmo,” chided Busby, “you 
can’t make a trade agreement. 
That’s against the law. Only Con- 
gress can—” 

Elmo interrupted. “That would 
be the case, Private Busby, if it 
were a matter of trade here on 
Earth. The people of the planet 
Kdoolit are not from Earth— or 
even our own Solar System. The 
Senator himself would have to 
agree that the law does not apply.” 

“We’ll pass a law!” shouted the 
Senator. 

“That might prevent a recur- 
rence,” said Elmo, “but it would 
hardly affect anything done before 
the passage of such a law. That is 
fortunate, since gleep is essential 
for the preservation of life on 
Earth. I have solved the problem. 



The rest is up to you.” 

“To me?” said Busby. “Why al- 
ways me?” 

“To the governments of Earth,” 
amended Elmo. 

“This time,” roared the Sena- 
tor, “you’ve gone too far! You’ve 
overstepped your authority—” 

“I suggest,” continued Elmo, 
“that Congress make arrangements 
with the people of Asia as to pay- 
ment. The shipment of gleep will 
be completed within forty-eight 
hours. I have been informed that 
the Kdoolans will require C.O.D. 
payment in full, since Earth has 
not yet established a galactic 
credit rating.” 

Busby was almost afraid to ask 
the obvious question. “Elmo, tell 
me. What’s the payment for this 
gleep?” 

“The best terms I could get for 
twenty billion tuns of gleep de- 
livered, via interstellar matter- 
portation, was the exchange of the 
ore for the continent of Asia. We’re 
getting a bargain.” 

“Busby, you heard him! You 
heard what he said! Asia — he 
traded twenty-billion tuns of greep 
for Asia!” 

“Gleep,” corrected Elmo, “not 
greep. Yes, it was difficult to find 
something the Kdoolans actually 
needed. There was nothing else to 
make it worthwhile for them to 
matterport the molten ore over the 
distance of four and one-third light- 
years.”

“He’s sold one of Earth’s conti- 
nents . moaned the Senator. 

“Only after exploring every 
other possibility,” said Elmo. 

Busby tried another angle. “You 
can’t do that, Elmo. It’s against 
all your restrictive tapes. All those 
millions of people—” 

“Oh, no, not the people,” said 
Elmo, “just the land. Though it 
may create problems of relocation 
and reorganization, that is not in- 
soluble.” 

The Senator staggered around 
in circles as if trying to tag some- 
one in a game of blind man’s buff. 
“He’s crazy! He’s out of his mind! 
How can he sell a chunk of Earth?” 

T>USBY suspected that he had 
not yet learned the complete 
story. “Elmo, what do they want 
with Asia?” 

“The Kdoolans live on a planet 
whose land mass rests on a high- 
ly unstable molten core. It is this 
lava from which they are able to 
pump out gleep — somewhat as 
we pump out oil. But they are 
desperately in need of land. Most 
of what they have keeps sinking 
below sea level or getting upended 
as mountain ranges.” 

“Well, they can’t have Asia!” 
shouted the Senator. “That’s final. 
Get in touch with ’em and tell ’em 
we’ll give anything else we can 
spare, but not Asia—” 

“The Kdoolans,” said Elmo, 
“have already begun delivery. 



Their sales representative, Kzar, 
informs me that as soon as the 
shipment is delivered in full, they 
will insist on payment If we don’t 
give them Asia, they’ll just take 
it.” 

“We’ll fight! Asia or no Asia, 
it’s a part of Earth and we’re not 
letting any aliens get a foothold—” 
Elmo’s voice sounded almost 
weary. “The Kdoolans have a cul- 
ture far beyond ours. We would 
have no way of stopping them 
fron\ taking Asia. And now, if 
you’ll excuse me, I have a new 
problem to work out.” 

Busby avoided the Senator’s 
stare. “N-new problem?” 

“The problem of relocating the 
entire population of Asia.” 

Senator Ferdus’ voice turned 
frantic. “You can’t do that! That’s 
half the population of Earth to 
spread over the other half!” 

“The alternative, Senator, is 
having an irate party of Kdoolans 
take over Earth for themselves. 
Now, if you don’t mind, I’m faced 
with the serious problem of trans- 
porting hundreds of millions of 
refugees during the next few days. 
Since the Computer Base is set 
up as a teleport station, I will use 
this as a port of entry.” 

The Senator was trying to direct 
Busby’s attention to the screen. 
“Look! Look! Make him stop it, 
Busby! Make him stop!” 

Busby saw them. There in the 
shimmering, widening ball of 



90

orange light in the meadow, 
framed against the background of 
hundreds of giant tanks, were a 
dozen strange creatures — serpen- 
tine things that had never walked 
the Earth before. 

The Senator grabbed the phone 
on Busby’s desk, and when he 
finally found the right end, he 
shouted into it. “Get me the White 
House. The President. Emergen- 
cy. Invasion from outer space! Hel- 
lo! No, I’m not crazy! Tell him to 
call an emergency meeting!” 

Slamming the phone into its 
cradle, he shook his fist at Busby. 
“It’s all your fault. You’d better 
do something about it — and 
damned quick!” 

Before Busby could answer, the 
Senator was out of the room. 

A T the secret meeting of the 
cabinet and the leaders of 
Congress, it was agreed that some 
other payment should be made 
to the aliens for the gleep. 

“What if they refuse?” asked 
the Senator from Missouri. 

“Then,” declared the Secretary 
of State, “we go to the brink of 
war!” 

Busby, forgetting that he was 
merely an invited guest, spoke 
up. “Mr. Secretary, Elmo won’t 
permit war.” 

The Secretary glowered at Bus- 
by and thoughtfully pulled his 
lip. “You misquote me, sir. I didn’t 
say war.” 



“But you said—” 

“I know exactly what I said, 
sir. I said the brink of war. Your 
Electronic Monitor has no right 
to prevent us from going to the 
brink of war as often as we like. 
It is absolutely necessary as a dip- 
lomatic technique for preserving 
the peace. And this is a time, above 
all, for diplomacy.” 

It was motioned, seconded and 
passed unanimously (Busby not 
being permitted to vote) that all 
dealings with the aliens should be 
conducted through Elmo, and 
since everyone was certain that 
Elmo would not permit the Kdoo- 
lans to attack, it was established 
that absolutely no concessions 
were to be made. 

Elmo had to find another way 
to make payment, and Busby was 
responsible for seeing it done. 

Several of the Senators had 
ideas. The Senator from Wiscon- 
sin said that if the government 
would assure a subsidy, his state 
would be glad to provide cheese 
for payment of the gleep. At this 
suggestion, the Senator from Kan- 
sas leaped to his feet and said that 
wheat was the staff of life, and 
that the government should con- 
sider buying it from the farmers 
of his state to use as payment. 
The Senator from Texas just 
wanted to point out that if gleep 
had oil in it, it was subject to 
tariff, and he had to insist that 
his state be protected. 



THE TROUBLE WITH ELMO 



91 



Busby was confused until he re- 
membered it was an election year. 
This was, obviously, the beginning 
of a series of speeches for the peo- 
ple — speeches that would be re- 
called on the floor of the Senate 
for inclusion into the Congres- 
sional Record. 

Nobody noticed Busby leave 
the meeting. 

’■7' ZAR of Kdoolit, a long lizard- 
like creature with red scales, 
long tentacle-arms, and two faces, 
was waiting when Busby entered 
Elmo’s control room. Elmo intro- 
duced them. Kzar bowed gracious- 
ly. His head appeared to be sup- 
ported on a swivel base, and one 
of his faces smiled while the other 
one frowned. 

“I turn the face of peace in your 
direction. We have come in peace- 
ful trade, and now we ask pay- 
ment for our services.” 

“But we can’t give you Asia.” 
Busby frowned as he replied. 

Kzar immediately stirred in 
alarm. His glistening scales stood 
on end and he swiveled his head 
around, displaying an angry coun- 
tenance. “You dare to make war?” 
“No! No!” gasped Busby, trying 
to smile through his chattering 
teeth. “Of course not. I forgot about 
the facial expression—” 

Elmo soothed his visitor, ex- 
plaining the difference in facial 
mobility on Earth. Earthlings, he 
pointed out, could frown when 



they were really happy, pretend- 
ing they had nothing to be hap- 
py about. “This,” said Elmo, “pre- 
vents the envy of a neighbor or a 
friend. A necessary protective de- 
vice. On the other hand, humans 
can smile when they are actually 
angry and even preparing for war. 
Very different from your people, 
Kzar. You must make allowances.” 

Kzar looked doubtful, but he 
finally relaxed and listened to Bus- 
by. However, argue as he might, 
Busby could not convince Kzar 
that it was impractical to take 
Asia. How would the United States 
explain to the people of Asia that 
their land had been confiscated as 
payment in a business deal with 
another planet? “It won’t do any 
good,” said Busby, “to tell them 
we’re doing it to save mankind. 
We’ve used that excuse too often 
before.” 

“I see no alternative,” thought 
Kzar, telepathing impatiently. “I 
assure you that neither Wisconsin 
cheese nor your Idaho potatoes nor 
Kansas wheat will serve us in the 
place of land. Now, if you’ll ex- 
cuse us, I have details to work out 
with your great problem solver, 
Elmo, about converting our gleep 
into gases to release into your at- 
mosphere.” 

T ATER that afternoon, at the 
" White House, Busby learned 
that Senator Ferdus had reported 
to his commanding officer about 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the chess games with Elmo. It was 
generally agreed that Busby’s mis- 
use of Elmo had resulted in the 
crisis at hand. Furthermore, the 
Senator suggested to the Army 
that Busby had the power to solve 
this whole mess if he really wanted 
to, and it was obviously his lack 
of patriotism that prevented him 
from doing so. He even hinted that 
Busby might be a Kdoolit agent 
in disguise, planted here on Earth 
years ago to work out this dia- 
bolical plot. 

When they finally let Busby go, 
it was with the ultimatum to find 
a way of preventing the loss of 
Asia and at the same time getting 
rid of the Kdoolan threat to the 
peace. As the General of the Army 
put it: “Private Busby, that’s an 
order! See that you do it or—” 

Outside, Busby sat down on the 
steps of the Capitol. For half an 
hour, he sat there feeding the 
pigeons while he wept. “Whatever 
I do, I’m going to get it in the 
neck. I feel like telling them to 
take this uniform and do what- 
ever they damn well please with 
it.” He sat there daydreaming 
about what it would be like to 
go home to Allenville, back to his 
little repair shop, where he could 
make his daily rounds from door 
to door and do little odd jobs for 
his friends and neighbors. 

If there was one thing he knew, 
it was that he had no business be- 
ing in the Army. He was the kind 



of guy who just had to be his own 
boss, and he had discovered to 
his sorrow, after so many years, 
that being your own boss was 
something they tended not to en- 
courage in the Army. 

That, of course, was what gave 
him the idea. 

All the way back to Computer 
Base in the copter, he went over 
and over the details in his mind. 
There was no doubt about it, it 
would work. If only he was not 
too late. 

When he arrived, Kzar was still 
there, and Busby — remember- 
ing to smile broadly — communi- 
cated his proposition. Kzar listened 
quietly, thought about it, and fi- 
nally agreed to leave Asia exactly 
where it was. He praised Busby for 
a most superior solution to the 
entire problem. Busby smiled and 
let his hand rest contentedly on 
the metal shell that covered Elmo’s 
master keys. From now on, things 
were going to be mighty different 
around here. 

TT’ ARLY next morning, Busby 
admitted Senator Ferdus to 
the Vault and informed him that 
the crisis was over. 

The Senator looked suspicious. 
“What crisis?” 

“Well, the Kdoolans are gone 
and Asia is still where it always 
was. That’s why I called you.” 

The Senator shook his head. 
“Busby, I don’t believe a word of 



THE TROUBLE WITH ELMO 



93 



it. What are you trying to pull 
now?” 

Busby flipped the dials on the 
televiewer to focus on the meadow 
where the Kdoolans first landed 
on Earth. They were gone and so 
were their empty gleep tanks. 
Once again the meadow was green. 

The Senator stared. “And you 
say Asia is still where it belongs?” 

Busby nodded. 

“All right, Busby, what have you 
done? If you’ve betrayed our gov- 
ernment in any way — given away 
any military secrets—” 

Busby waved these comments 
aside. “The only thing I gave away 
was our problem.” He flipped the 
dial to show the area where the 
Electronic Computer had once 
stood. “The Kdoolans were crazy 
about Elmo. They have tremen- 
dous problems to solve. We’ve 
been wanting to get rid of Elmo 
for the last fifteen years. So — the 
most logical thing in the world — 
I gave them Elmo instead of 
Asia.” 

Senator Ferdus blinked vacant- 
ly. “You gave them what?” 

“All your worries are over. The 
Kdoolans transported Elmo to 
Proxima Centauri during the 
night. As far as Earth is concerned, 
he’s completely dismantled, de- 
commissioned, demolished. Elmo 
is gone.” 

As the words took effect, the 
Senator began to burble. 

“You — you gave Elmo away? 



A multi-billion dollars worth of 
equipment? All the computer 
secrets that we’ve guarded all these 
years? You gave them away? This 
is treason, Busby! Treason! You 
can be executed for this! And I 
promise you, Busby, I promise 
you—” 

Busby backed away. He had 
known this was going to happen, 
that Senator Ferdus would be on 
his back no matter what he did. 

“Wait a minute, Busby. You’re 
lying.” The Senator paused and 
looked at the screen again. “You 
know as well as I do that Elmo 
was built to solve problems for 
human beings. Elmo just won’t 
work up there on Kdoolit And 
besides, there’s no one who knows 
how to service him but you, Bus- 
by — and you’re here. Come clean, 
Busby. Let’s have the truth. What 
have you done with Elmo? 
Where’d you hide him? You ought 
to know you can’t swipe a multi- 
billion-dollar government computer 
and get away with it. What have 
you done with the blasted—” 

The Senator stopped. His eyes 
opened wide; his thick white eye- 
brows arched into question marks; 
his red face drained of all its color. 
He looked frantically around the 
chamber. The door hadn’t opened, 
and there was no place where Bus- 
by could possibly have hidden. 

“Busby?” he whispered. ‘Where 
are you, Busby?” 

He looked under the desk, be- 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



hind the chairs, between the rows 
of empty shells where Elmo’s elec- 
tronic computing units had, until 
yesterday, pulsed with thought. 

“It’s all just a bad dream,” he 
reassured himself. “He couldn’t 
just vanish into thin air. He was 
never here ...” 

Yet there, in the ashtray, chewed 
to shreds as it always was when 
Busby was upset, the Senator saw 
Busby’s still-lit cigar. 

“Busby!” he roared, pounding 
the desk with his fist. “Busby, 
come back!” 

TN a hastily erected Computer 
Base on Kdoolit, the second 
planet in the system of Proxima 
Centauri, Mr. Jake Busby relaxed 
over the chess board with a tall, 
frosty glass of Kdoolan beer. He 
smiled as he recalled his last 



glimpse of Senator Harry Ferdus’ 
face. As Ferdus had said, Elmo 
would solve problems only for 
humans. But Jake Busby was the 
one man who could service Elmo, 
and Jake Busby was a human, 
wasn’t he? 

And then, thought Busby, when 
all the problems on Kdoolit were 
solved, there would be no need for 
Elmo to manufacture new ones. 
There were millions of worlds in 
the Cosmos with intelligent life 
and problems to be solved. Now 
Elmo had a reason to exist, and, 
for that matter, so did Busby. 
They were partners in the Univer- 
sal Fixit Company. 

“Anyway,” he said aloud, fin- 
ishing the glass of beer, “it’s a liv- 
ing — and I’m my own boss.” 

“Your move,” said Elmo.

N OBODY moaned: “Buddy, 
please listen to me? I’m 
hungry. Couldn’t you at 
least give me something to eat?” 
We paid no attention, of course. 
“Oliver,” Diane said. “I love 
you.” 

I stopped and kissed her. No- 
body sobbed and drifted away in 
the mist. 

All of Grendoon was down by 
the Wallow. Torches inflamed the 
fog like living lips of fire, kissing 
each other as they blended. The 
noise of the big jungle machines 
boomed in the background, but 
it was almost drowned out by the 
crowd, a constant bull’s bellow 
of noise.

“Listen to them, Diane,” I said. 
“They’re happy.” 

“And so am I,” she whispered. 

“You don’t miss the plantation?” 

“No.” 

“Nor-” 

“Nor Albert,” she said emphati- 
cally. “Especially not Albert.” I 
felt her shiver in spite of the fact 
that the temperature was a hun- 
dred and ten. 

Nobody clutched at my arm, 
looming out of the mist, but I 
shook him off and he flinched mut- 
tering away. 

I stopped, looking at Diane. 
Suddenly she was tense. “What’s 
the matter?” 

She asked in a small voice: “Did 
you recognize that one?” It was 
embarrassing. I shook my head. 
She said: “I did, Oliver. He used 
to work for Albert too. And he 
crossed him, and now—” 

The joy froze in me. I said 
roughly: “Snub Albert! Let’s get 
down to the Wallow. This is our 
night, Diane — don’t let anything 
spoil it.” 

But behind us, in the fog, no- 
body was sniffling wretchedly. 

IT was sundown, you see. Not 
that we ever see the sun on 
Venus. But it makes a difference. 
During “day,” we stay indoors as 
much as we can, and when we go 
out, we wear not only thermosuits 
and hoods, but portable air — at 
least at “noon.” Toward twilight, 



we can breathe the ambient air; at 
dusk, we can leave off the hoods. 
At “night,” sometimes, you can go 
out without even a thermosuit, 
but this was a long way from night. 

The other thing that happens 
at night is that the fog begins to 
condense. For about two months 
right around “midnight,” the ceiling 
climbs, sometimes, to a thousand 
feet; but all that water has to go 
somewhere, and it does. 

It makes a nice celebration. 

Grendoon has nearly eighteen 
hundred people living in it, and 
I don’t think a hundred were left 
minding the store. Everybody else 
was laughing and joking and wan- 
dering around, carrying the torches, 
waiting for the water. The kids get 
an enormous kick out of it, but so 
do most of the grownups. 

“It’s coming,” whispered Diane. 

“I see.” 

Already the bottom of the Wal- 
low was sticky red mud, like the 
blood that runs out of a prime 
roast of beef. We were at the 
town end of the Wallow now, fol- 
lowing the tapewalks toward the 
deep part, toward the hills. 

“Here you are, buddy!” shouted 
a vendor, grinning, and thrust a 
pair of torches at me. I paid him, 
handed one to Diane and walked 
on. 

There’s a reason for the torches, 
too. The English knew about it; 
in the old wars, before aircraft 
bothered much with radar, the Eng- 



98

lish were plagued by fog. They 
dug trenches around their landing 
strips and filled them with oil; 
the planes came in, and maybe the 
fog was too thick; so they touched 
off the trenches of oil, and the 
curtain of flame burned off the 
fog. 

That’s what the torches did. 
First we could see outlines, then 
bright beads of light from the 
torches themselves, and by the 
time a thousand torches were all 
aburn, we could see for more than 
fifty yards. We didn’t need tape- 
walks then; we hurried down the 
bank toward the cheering, jostling 
throng. 

There was a roar from the north 
end of the Wallow, where the 
sludgy creek drained thick juices 
from the hills. “It’s coming!” 

Diane took her hand off my fore- 
arm. I released her hand. We both 
pressed forward, looking. 

In the licking light of the torches, 
the first thin trickle of water was 
coming down into the Wallow. It 
happens every few months, every 
time slow Venus makes a com- 
plete spin around its axis relative 
to the sun; but it was like a miracle. 
It always was. 

Even inside my thermosuit, I 
felt cooler, more comfortable. It 
was like Iowa in October; it was 
like the first freeze-up on the 
stream that went by everybody’s 
home, long ago. The water was 
coming down! 



I whispered: “It’s a wonderful 
time to be in love.” 

But Diane wasn’t beside me. 

?rr|ARLING! Where are you?” 
I bawled. 

And then I saw her. 

She had been separated in the 
crowd, but she was only a couple 
of yards away, stumbling back 
toward me. I couldn’t see her face, 
only the hooded neck and line 
of her jaw, obscured by the trans- 
parent mantle of the thermosuit. 
But it was enough. 

Diane was terrified. 

A huge hulking cow of a man, 
a face like a footprint in mud, an 
expression like a stepped-on lizard, 
was bellowing angrily at her: 
“Wassamatta thew? Whyntcha 
watchwatcha doing?” 

Diane turned to me, white-faced. 
“Darling,” she sobbed, “this gen- 
tleman says I jostled him.” 
“What?” 

“I— I didn’t, dear! You believe 
me, don’t you?” 

“Of course.” But it was like a 
knell tolling. 

“You’ve got to believe me!” 

“I believe you.” But it didn’t 
matter; nothing mattered; we both 
knew the score then. 

I said to the bellowing man: 
“Sir, my fiancee is deeply apolo- 
getic. The crowd — the excitement 
— all the confusion—” 

He stared at me, lowering. He 
glanced around, under shaggy eye- 



SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES 



99 



brows, gauging the mood of the 
crowd around us. It didn’t satisfy 
him. He shrugged and moved off. 

“Come on, dear,” I said, and ur- 
gently hurried her along. 

She said: “Oliver. They won’t 
give up. They’ll try again.” 

“It won’t do them any good!” 
“But it will, Oliver,” she said 
reasonably. “You know Albert. He 
never gives up. That was just one 
of his bullies. He’ll have others.” 
I took her by the elbows and 
turned her around to face me. 
In the red and shuddering light 
from the torches, her eyes were 
dark but luminous; her face was 
sad and calm. Her beauty wrung 
my heart. 

“We can take care of ourselves, 
Diane,” I promised. But it was a 
lie. I knew it was a lie. Albert 
Quayle hadn’t given up, not that 
easily. He wasn’t going to let me 
have his wife without a fight 
He was out to get her — with 
hired assassins, no doubt 

And when she was gone, he 
would be coming after me. I re- 
membered how nobody had whim- 
pered in the fog. 

“Will we whimper, do you 
think?” Diane asked suddenly. 

It was no more than I was ask- 
ing myself. 

I caught her arm and turned her 
again toward the Wallow. Our 
torches were getting low. I threw 
them into the first few inches of 
silted water and we watched, with- 

100 



out words, as they choked and 
died. 

II 

T^HE world had begun for me 
six months before. 

I came down on the ship from 
Earth like a newborn baby, all 
pink and squally, tied into my de- 
celeration-proof bassinet, crushed 
with the parturition pains of land- 
ing by rocket on an alien planet. 

What did I know? The ads said, 
“Venus, the New Frontier.” They 
said, “Venus, the planet where 
every man can start over,” and, 
“Own 1,000 Acres! Be Your Own 
Boss on Venus!” 

It wasn’t any lie. It was all there. 

I got out of the ship at Gren- 
doon and got on the line at Cus- 
toms. It wasn’t a long line. 

“Immigrant?” they asked. 

And I said: “Sure. I’m going to 
spend the rest of my life here.” 

It was true. But I didn’t know 
why they laughed. 

I didn’t know that there wasn’t 
any choice. I didn’t know that, 
once you’re conditioned for Venus, 
you can’t ever live on Earth again. 

They let you wear the brassard 
for two weeks — everybody knows 
what it means; everybody gives 
you plenty of leeway. That’s so 
you can find your way around. 
You get a place to live. You get 
a job. You make your plans. You 
make up your mind. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Then — if you want to stay — 
you get conditioned. 

If not, there’s the return rocket 
waiting. 

Before I was conditioned, they 
sold me a thermosuit and pinned a 
brassard on it, with the sparkling 
word Visitor brightly picked out 
in diamond ink. They gave me a 
card with Quayle’s name and ad- 
dress on it, and turned me loose to 
hit him up for a job. 

Then I stepped out into the hot, 
penetrating fog. 

Albert Quayle’s address was on 
Breezy Point, overlooking the Wal- 
low. I struggled along the tape- 
walks, and even inside the ther- 
mosuit I was wringing wet It was 
a hot day. The fog was whitely 
bright, a flour of soggy pearls that 
I stirred as I walked. I sucked a 
tube of suit air, but my face was 
exposed to the steam; I felt as if 
I were being gently boiled. Voices 
spoke to me out of the fog, beg- 
ging; but I couldn’t help them and 
so I ignored them as might any 
citizen of Grendoon. 

Then I came to Albert Quayle’s 
house. 

Enormous blowers ripped the 
fog to tendrils around it. I could 
see it through a wavering haze. A 
big place, pink aluminum, with pic- 
ture windows — to look out on fog. 
A big place for a big shot, and that 
was Albert Quayle. 

I walked up the cinderblock 
path. 



It was like a Japanese garden 
back on Earth. Out of the con- 
densation sumps in the walls, a 
stream of hot water pulsed. It 
flowed through cement -walled 
troughs across a cactus garden; the 
path went over one of the brooks, 
gently steaming, on a little arched 
bridge. It was expensive; spend- 
ing that much on his house, you 
couldn’t blame him for spending 
enough on blowers to give it a 
chance to be seen. The water, of 
course, came out of the sluice from 
the air-conditioning. It had to go 
somewhere. But the garden, the 
little stream, the bridge — that took 
money. 

That was what Quayle had. He 
had money, and he had something 
more than money. 

He had Diane. 

I RANG. The door opened. 
There she was. 

I glanced at the card in my 
gauntleted fingers. “Mrs. Quayle?” 
I inquired formally. 

“I am Mrs. Quayle,” she ack- 
nowledged just as formally. 

Tm looking for a job,” I mum- 
bled. 

A figure like a nightclub moan- 
er. Eyes like the sad pits of Hell. 
Lips that tragically invited. 

I tore my eyes off her and 
dashed them against the card 
again. “Your husband — they said 
at the office that he could help 
me.” 



SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES 



101 



“Help you?” Her voice was like 
a bitter lullaby. “He’ll help himself. 
But he’ll give you a job, if that’s 
what you want.” 

And then I knew I was in love. 

And I knew what it meant. Be- 
cause even then, not twenty-four 
hours on Venus, I knew who Al- 
bert Quayle was. I knew that he 
wasn’t a man to tangle with, not 
in Grendoon, not if you wanted to 
stay alive. 

But I had tangled with him after 
all. I had taken from him the one 
possession he did not care to lose. 

Diane caught my hand now. 
She was shaking. “Oliver, Oliver. 
It’s him.” 

“I know.” 

“That fat man — he was work- 
ing for Albert.” 

“I know.” 

“He’s out to get us. Both of us! 
Oliver, I shouldn’t have let you do 
this. It’s the end.” 

“I know.” 

“Quit saying ‘I know’!” she 
screamed. 

I patted her hand, through the 
gauntlet, to show that I under- 
stood. Gently I led her along the 
banks of the Wallow, down to 
where the crowd was thickest. 

“I’m sorry, Oliver,” she whis- 
pered suddenly. “I’d like to kill 
him.” 

“You can’t.” 

“I know I can’t, but I’d like to. 
If only we weren’t conditioned—” 

I said: “Forget it. We’re through 

102 



with him. As soon as your divorce 
is final, we get married. That’s 
that.” 

I glanced at my watch, un- 
der the transparent gauntlet of the 
thermosuit. “Only another hour,” 
I told her. 

“Oh, Oliver!” 

HP HAT was more like it. The ex- 
pression on her face was a can- 
dy bride’s, beaming from the top 
of a white frosted wedding cake. 
Only another hour and then the 
statutory waiting period would be 
over. It was hard to believe that 
already eleven hours had passed 
since we confronted Quayle with 
our love. 

Almost gaily, we moved among 
the rejoicing throng. It was fes- 
tival; the Grendoonians were laugh- 
ing, singing, like happy children. 

It was like Iowa when I was 
a boy. There, when the creeks 
froze over, the whole town would 
come down to the lake — the 
grownups to watch, the teen-agers 
to skate, the old ones and the 
babies to walk stiff-legged across 
the ice, everyone enjoying what 
the weather had done. 

Here it was fog into water, water 
enough to fill the Wallow and 
make a pond of it for a few months 
of each year. There it had been 
water into ice, but the principle 
was the same; it was carnival 
time. 

Nobody came sniffling up to 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



us. Abjectly he asked: “Mister, 
please. I’m hungry! Couldn’t you 
help me out?” 

Diane shivered and clutched my 
arm. For an instant, I was tempted 
to speak, but the instant passed. 
And then there was a confused 
clamor, and the nobody suddenly 
turned. 

“An Earthie!” he gasped, joy- 
ful, and darted away from us. 

Diane stood on tiptoe, peering. 
“It is,” she said. “Look, darling!” 

And there he was, an Earth- 
man, tall and dark-faced with the 
UV tan of a sunny planet; but 
his face was crimson with anger 
now. He was backed against the 
margin of the Wallow, surrounded 
by a dozen nobodies, imploring, 
clamoring, begging unashamed for 
food, lodging, for help — for every- 
thing. 

His gold brassard shone clear, 
with the word Visitor glittering in 
diamond ink. It was an invitation 
to every shunned nobody in Gren- 
doon, for only an Earthie was low 
enough to talk to them. Short of 
grubbing for roots and making tree- 
houses in the jungle and taking 
their chances with swamp, disease 
and saposaurs, it was the only way 
nobodies could live, by finding a 
Terrestrial to help them. 

But this Terrestrial was making 
hard work of it. He was offering 
them money, which was foolish — 
what good was money to them? 
And he was striking at them in 



annoyance, which was even worse. 
It was bringing him down to the 
level of the nobodies, almost. 

“I’ll have to help him,” I told 
Dianne. 

She nodded. 

I walked sternly over to him. 
The nobodies scattered like mist 
before me. 

r I ’HEY fled, whimpering, as I be- 
gan to talk to him. 

He said angrily: “Thanks. What 
kind of a place is this?” 

“I’m sorry you were bothered. 
Don’t pay any attention to them. 
They’ll go away.” 

“But why?” 

“It’s the way we do things here,” 
I said. 

“Humph.” He looked at me ir- 
ritably. In a high, shrill voice, his 
face pouting like a fish out of 
water, he complained: “I don’t 
think much of Venus. What a gyp! 
I spent twenty-five hundred bucks 
on this trip. I might as well have 
gone to the Moon.” 

“You’re a tourist?” 

“That’s what they said when 
they sold me the ticket,” he an- 
swered disagreeably. 

“I’m sorry.” 

“It isn’t your fault,” he admitted. 
Then he tried to be a little more 
friendly. “Look,” he said confiden- 
tially, “is this all there is to it? I 
mean the Coming of the Water, 
and the spirit of Mardi Gras that 
rims through the town and all, like 



SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES 



103 



they said in the travel agency?” 

“This is all.” 

“Man!” He shook his head rue- 
fully. “But isn’t there, well, some 
place where I can find a little more 
excitement? I came millions of 
miles. I’ve been saving up for this 
vacation for years.” 

“Not the kind of excitement you 
want, mister,” I told him, and 
turned to look for Diane. 

But she wasn’t there. 

“Darling!” I shouted, and heard 
my voice drowned out in the mul- 
titudinous cries of the crowd 
around the Wallow. “Darling, 
where are you?” 

No answer. 

“Something wrong, buddy?” 
asked the Earthie. 

I didn’t have any answer for 
him. Yes, something was wrong- 
plenty was wrong; but there wasn’t 
anything he could do about it. 

She was gone. Search as I did, 
I couldn’t find her. Quayle. It had 
to be Quayle. Somehow, in the 
minutes when I let her out of my 
sight, he had begun his revenge. 

Ill 

T^RANTIC, I hurried back to the 
hotel. Where else was there 
to go? 

The room clerk looked at me 
funny. I don’t know how else to 
put it. It was the kind of look I 
got from everybody when I first 
came to Venus, but I hadn’t seen 



it since I got conditioned to live 
here and took off the brassard. 

I went up in the elevator, and 
the room clerk’s look went out of 
my mind like a nobody vanishing 
into the fog. There wasn’t room 
for it. The only thing I had space 
for in my mind was Diane, Diane 
gone. I hurried down the corridor 
and unlocked the door, my fingers 
shaking. 

“Darling!” I cried. 

But there was no answer. 

She wasn’t there. The room was 
empty— our room. We had checked 
into it that morning, gone out to 
file for her divorce, eaten, wasted a 
little time, then decided to visit 
the Wallow since we were in a 
holiday mood. 

But that mood was gone. 

It had been the slimmest of 
hopes that she might have come 
back to the hotel, but now even 
that hope was gone . 

And then I took a longer look 
at the room. It was as if someone 
— incredibly, impossibly — had 
struck me. 

The cigarette butts were still in 
the ashtrays. 

A soggy towel hung sloppily 
across a rack. 

Across the back of a chair, 
Diane’s afternoon thermosuit lay 
slackly, its efnpty arms reaching 
out to the wastebasket. 

The room had not been cleaned! 

I turned slowly and looked at 
the back of the door, but I knew 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



before I looked what I would see. 

There was a pink slip taped to 
the door — pink, the color of the 
complaint forms of the Maids, But- 
lers and Domestics. I read it with 
cold attention, though I knew what 
it would say.

Said: “This room is a disgusting

T OPENED the door and went 
racing back down to the lobby. 
The desk clerk was all smiles, 
with a sneer folded into the mid- 
dle of every one of them. “Yes, Mr. 
Sawyer. The room? Oh, I’m sor- 
ry, Mr. Sawyer. That Grievance 
Report — some sort of mistake, 
I’m sure. But the chambermaid—” 
I said tightly: “What about the 
chambermaid?” 

“Oh, you know, Mr. Sawyer. 
They don’t like to be ordered 
around. You can’t blame them.” 



I got a grip on myself. “Look. 
We didn’t even call the chamber- 
maid. Don’t you understand? We 
were getting married. We came in, 
dropped the suitcases, grabbed 
something to eat down here in the 
dining hall, and that’s it. Outside 
of that, we weren’t even in the 
hotel.” 

“Oh. The dining hall, yes.” 

I stopped short. ‘What about 
the dining hall?” 

He shrugged faintly. “You know, 
Mr. Sawyer. I’m sorry to have to 
tell you, but there’s been a com- 
plaint in the dining room too.” 
“It isn’t possible!” 

The clerk whispered chilling- 
ly: “Mr. Sawyer, are you telling 
me that I lie?” 

I said, fast: “It’s just a mistake, 
I mean. I remember everything 
that happened in the dining room. 
The waitress was downright won- 
derful. Why, we talked to her! And 
I left her a big tip! And—” 

“Excuse me, Mr. Sawyer. I’m 
rather busy.” 

I took the warning. 

There seemed to be only one 
thing to do. 

I walked across the lobby of the 
hotel; it was like walking through 
a mushy daiquiri. Ice floated on all 
sides of me. The atmosphere was 
congealed. The bellboys looked 
but saw me not; the elevator men 
glanced through me at the room 
clerk, but never realized I was 
alive; at the entrance to the dining

room, the hostess sucked a tooth 
and stared at the wall and hummed 
quietly to herself. 

I walked past her. She didn’t 
blink. 

I found a table and sat down. 

In about fifteen minutes, a wait- 
ress came up to my table. “Miss,” 
I said eagerly, “I—” 

But she checked the setting with 
a practiced eye and walked away 
again. 

I stared after her. More minutes 
passed. 

I cleared my throat. ‘Miss,” I 
said again to the waitress as she 
came to the table next to mine to 
take an order. “Miss!” 

But she didn’t respond and, 
after one quick, curious glance, 
neither did the customers at the 
table. 

It was the deep-freeze, all right; 
they were cutting me dead. 

And I turned back to the table, 
and just caught a glimpse of the 
back of another waitress. For a 
moment, I had the crazy notion 
that she had been about to serve 
me. But that notion was wrong. 
She had been to my table, all right; 
the proof was on the table before 
me, a sheet of bright green paper. 

I read it. 

It was bad. 

f I ''HE pink slip from the cham- 
bermaid had been bad enough. 
It meant that no member of the 
local would ever clean a room for 

106 



me in a hotel while the Grievance 
Report was outstanding. But all 
that meant was that I couldn’t live 
in a hotel, and there were, after 
all, other places to live if I worked 
at finding them. That complaint 
wasn’t fatal. 

But the green one was more 
serious. It was on the stationery 
of the Cooks, Waiters and Restau- 
rant Workers: 

COMPLAINT 
Re : Oliver Sawyer 

Offense: Deliberate undertipping 

Miss Gina Sortini of this res- 
taurant served the abovemen- 
tioned Customer luncheon. Cus- 
tomer seemed well satisfied with 
the service and made no com- 
plaint. Nor, according to affidavit 
of headwaiter, hostess and cashier, 
had Customer any just cause for 
complaint 

After Customer had left, Wait- 
ress found two pennies under 
plate. It was not absentminded- 
ness. Waitress distinctly remem- 
bers seeing Customer put money 
under plate, whereupon Cus- 
tomer’s Guest, a young woman, 
commented upon said gratuity 
and both Customer and Guest 
laughed and made several joking 
remarks. 

Matter referred to Grievance 
Adjuster this date. 

And that meant that eat I could 
or starve I might, but I would do 
neither of them in any public res- 
taurant in Grendoon. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

I remembered Diane’s comment 
and how we had laughed — that 
part was true. But it had been be- 
cause the tip was large; I was ex- 
travagant, she said. 

There was no mistake here. It 
was deliberate. There was no long- 
er any possible doubt. 

I got up and walked slowly 
away from the table. I was the In- 
visible Man. I went out into the 
lobby, hesitated, crossed it to the 
door. I was still carrying my ther- 
mosuit; I hadn’t stayed in my 
room long enough to take it off. 

I walked hopelessly out of the 
door and into the hot gray night. 

There was a pile of luggage on 
the broad steps outside the double- 
paned door. I tripped over it, 
started to walk on, went back and 
looked more closely. 

It was my luggage. 

IV 

T RENTED an armored car and 
-*• raced out to the spaceport. 
Thank heaven it was only the 
hotels and restaurants so far! 

But it would be more, for Quayle 
would never stop. I would have 
to face it some day and find an 
answer, or live through the total 
extinction of my personality that 
came with being shunned like any 
other nobody. But I wouldn’t face 
it now, not until I had found 
Diane. 

It was only desperation that 



drove me to the spaceport. Cryp- 
tic roarings from the side of the 
taped road told us of the giant 
machines that were at work in the 
Ag fields. I turned at an inter- 
section and eased cautiously into 
the right-hand transverse road, the 
sonic feeler sending out beeps into 
the fog to search for oncoming 
cars. Abruptly there was a sod- 
den flare of white and the giant 
blast of an industrial explosive be- 
hind it 

It was like that everywhere, out- 
side of Grendoon and the other 
little cities. You don’t remake a 
planet without using power, a lot 
of power, in all quantities and 
forms. 

And, of course, power can be 
dangerous . wherefore the con- 
ditioning. 

I drove into the spaceport 
through a flaming fence of natural- 
gas jets. A rocket was coming in. 
The buildings loomed queerly tall 
in the faint residual mist — it was 
strange to see the top of a two- 
story building. But though I could 
see much, I could not see Diane. 

Nobody came weeping up to me 
on the walk outside the parking 
lot. I took a closer look. It was 
Vince Borton. 

I knew him — had known him, 
when he was alive; but the time 
was coming when I would no 
longer be able to make that dis- 
tinction. He was typical of the 
kind that hangs around the docks, 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



begging handouts from the tourist. 
He had been a farmer before. In 
fact, he farmed with me. In fact, 
he had come in from Earth on the 
rocket with me. And went to work 
with Quayle for me; and it was 
because he had been caught steal- 
ing money from Quayle’s pension 
fund that he was shunned. 

He sobbed: “Mister, please! If 
I don’t get something to eat, 111—” 

“I can’t help you, Vince,” I said. 

I left him staring after me, a 
shabby nobody with a flat-footed 
stance and an expression of hor- 
ror and surprise. 

People didn’t talk to nobodies. 

But when somebody did, it 
wasn’t to refuse help. 

And the only explanation of be- 
havior like mine was the true one: 
I was in process of becoming a no- 
body myself. 

A high, confidential voice be- 
hind me said: “What’s the matter, 
buddy? You don’t look as happy 
as you did last time I saw you.” 

I turned. I saw a bright gold 
brassard with the word Visitor 
picked out in diamond ink. 

It was the Earthie I had seen 
down by the Wallow. 

“Hello,” I said shortly. 

A N enormous roaring seeped out 
of the overhead mist. Tubes 
bellowing, the Earth rocket set- 
tled in on the landing pad, point- 
ing a finger of flame at Venus to 
destroy it and then embracing it. 



And then it started again. 

There was a crowd, as there al- 
ways is when a rocket’s coming in. 
A tall, lean fellow in a thermosuit 
of Agricultural yellow almost 
bumped into me. He nodded po- 
litely and started to turn away. 

“HeTshoo!” I sneezed. And so 
did the Earthie, two mighty, thun- 
dering sneezes. The Aggie whirled 
on us. His face was mottled and 
raging — much more so than the 
offense justified! 

He demanded: !< Whafs the mat- 
ter with you?” 

I said quickly: “I’m sorry. Very 
sorry. Excuse me. Us,” I added, 
though the Earthie hadn’t much 
to lose. I pulled the Earthie away 
after me. 

He looked at me with eyes like 
question marks. 

“Sneeze powder,” I explained 
to him in a low voice. 

“What?” 

“To make me sneeze on him.” 

“What?” 

“I’m sorry I got you into it, 
but the brassard will keep you out 
of trouble. Now you’d better leave 
me alone.” 

He stared at me with doubting 
eyes and pouty lips. “Look, I’m 
just a stranger here, but I don’t 
get it. Why the sneeze powder?” 

“To make trouble.” 

“Trouble.” He thought, and then 
admitted: “I heard about this kind 
of thing. You Venusians have your 
own system. Not like Earth.” 



SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES 



109 



“Not the least damned little bit 
like Earth.” 

“No violence, eh?” 

“We can’t afford it.” 

He nodded. “I know. They ex- 
plained it to me back at the travel 
agency. Something about condi- 
tioning. Venus is a frontier planet, 
and all frontiers are the same. 
Everybody is likely to kill every- 
body else. Especially because 
weapons are so powerful nowa- 
days.” 

“They have to be here, because 
of the saposaurs. But not just 
weapons.” 

“No, I know about that. Explo- 
sives. Big machines that could 
shred a man into confetti. So they 
condition you against violence, eh? 
No matter what happens, once 
you’re through with the condition- 
ing you can’t kill anybody. And 
if somebody is really out to get 
somebody else—” 

“He cuts him dead.” I nodded. 
“You have the picture. That’s 
what’s happening to me now. Now 
you better stay away from me—” 
“Dunlap.” 

“Whatever your name is — we 
haven’t been formally introduced. 
I don’t want to get you into 
trouble.” 

I turned and left him. The world 
was hot and empty without Diane; 
I didn’t want to share it with him. 

But I didn’t have much of a 
world to share. 

Even less than I’d thought. 



I" MARCHED out toward the 
parking lot and there was the 
Aggie again. He was on the taped 
path; the jets were off and the 
fog beginning to settle in again. 
I thought of swinging around him, 
but the path was narrow. 

I nodded politely. “Sorry,” I 
said formally. 

He looked at me with recogni- 
tion, then with annoyance. 

And then his eyes opened wide, 
and the expression became utter 
rage — contempt — hatred. 

“What — what’s the matter?” I 
faltered. 

He turned away without a word, 
as icy as the waitress in the hotel, 
as completely as an anybody had 
ever cut a nobody. 

Even if he was one of Quayle’s 
men, there was no reason for this. 
I watched, incredulous. 

In the haze of five yards of 
thickening fog, I saw him stop to 
talk to one of the field police. The 
Aggie walked on and the police- 
man came slowly toward me. I 
nodded politely. 

The policeman looked through 
me. He saw my face and memo- 
rized it; but he also didn’t see it, 
not at all. He looked at my chest 
for a thoughtful second. And then 
he turned and moved back toward 
the parking lot. 

I followed. 

He went to my car, produced 
an official electroseal, locked it. 
On the entrance door, he slapped 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a sticker with the glowing scarlet 
word: Impounded. 

“Hey!” I yelled. “What’s the 
matter?” 

There was no reason for that! It 
was the sort of treatment reserved 
for the gravest offenders — thieves, 
like Vince; accidental murderers; 
those who used the shunning serv- 
ices without good and sufficient 
reason . 

And one other category. 

I touched my chest. 

A sharp metal star point scraped 
my finger. Pinned to my thermo- 
suit was a badge — no, a brassard. 
The brassard. In diamond ink, the 
word Visitor flared. 

I was wearing the brassard with- 
out right. It was the lowest crime 
in this world. 

I had been framed. 

V 

~D USHING back along the tape- 
walks like a ghost put to flight 
with bell, book and candle, I 
looked for help. The only help in 
all the world for me just then was 
the Earthie. 

Vince Borton clutched at me 
out of the fog as I passed. “Oliver! 
You too?” 

“Me too.” 

“But why?” 

I said grimly, too full of hate 
and fear to answer: “Albert Quayle, 
that’s all. Good-by.” But he fol- 
lowed. 



I found Dunlap saying angrily 
to another new Earthie just pin- 
ning on his brassard: “Lousy place, 
not worth the plutonium to blow it 
to hell! Take my advice, Mac. 
Turn around. Get right back on 
that rocket and—” 

I stopped and said formally: “I 
beg your pardon.” 

He turned and looked at me. 
“Oh. You.” 

“Can you help me?” 
Suspiciously: “What do you 
mean? All I want is out, buddy. 
I don’t want to get in any trouble 
here.” 

“You can’t. You’re wearing the 
brassard.” 

“Maybe.” 

“There’s no risk involved! Re- 
member? We Venusians can’t use 
violence. That’s the first thing we 
do, before we take off the brassard. 
We get conditioned against it. And 
you’re immune to anything else. 
That’s what the brassard’s for.” 
“Well? You didn’t tell me what 
you want.” 

“I want you to come see how 
the other half lives. The Terra 
Club.” 

“What’s at the Terra Club?” 

“A man named Albert Quayle,” 
I said. 

"l^INCE hit us up for a ride back 
* to town — in Dunlap’s car, of 
course; I couldn’t use mine. I let 
him, provided he sat in the back 
seat. 



SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES 



111 



He grinned at me wryly. 

But I couldn’t apologize, because 
the fission-blasts were going off 
again and the noise drowned every- 
thing out for a moment. 

Dunlap demanded aggressively: 
“What is all that?” 

“That’s the reason.” 

“Blasting? The reason for 
what?” 

“The reason for the conditioning. 
Every man a Zeus, with real thun- 
derbolts, not mythical or magical. 
You’ve heard of the saposaurs?” 
“Saposaurs?” He nodded. “Sort 
of intelligent lizards, eh? But they 
don’t like people. They stay in the 
back lands.” 

“Most of the time. Not always. 
Look.” I pointed to ithe built-in 
machine guns on the car. “They’re 
needed, mister. It isn’t safe to 
travel on Venus without plenty of 
weapons. And the tools! Plutonium 
built the Wallow. All of Venus 
was marsh. Most of it still is. With- 
out the atomic explosives to shove 
out the water, we’d be living in 
jellied mud.” 

He said hoarsely: “There isn’t 
any danger from the saposaurs in 
the car, is there?” 

“Not unless one shows up.” 

He said, “Oh.” 

Vince Borton volunteered eager- 
ly from the back seat — it must 
have been a joy for him to talk 
again — “There are plenty of them 
out in the fields. Not so much at 
night. They come in the daylight 



months, when there’s plenty of 
fog.” 

“Why?” 

“They like knives,” Vince told 
him. “They’re not really smart — 
sort of a gorilla plus twenty-five 
per cent. But they’re smart enough 
to know that steel will outlast their 
teeth and claws. They never had 
fire and don’t much want it. Steel 
is something else. They’ll break up 
a car, if they can, just to take the 
jagged metal for weapons.” 

Dunlap said slowly: “But — all 
right, granted you have to have 
strong safeguards against violence, 
with all that plutonium around, 
and guns to protect against the 
saposaurs. What about this busi- 
ness of ignoring people to death?” 
“Shunning them,” I corrected 
him. “Cutting them dead. There 
has to be some way, mister. The 
community can’t tolerate anti-so- 
cial behavior. Why, if somebody 
insults my wife, I can’t hit him — 
I don’t know how any more. The 
community has to have protection 
against — against — ” 

“Against you and me,” said 
Vince mournfully from the back 
seat. 

T¥7E dropped Vince at the edge 
** of the city and followed the 
tapewalks to the Terra Club. 

Dunlap complained: “It’s hot. 
I don’t like it this hot.” 

“You weren’t forced to come to 
Venus.”

“But I can’t stand this heat!” He 
was fretful and irritable — because 
he didn’t like what he was getting 
into, I was sure. 

“Watch the tape,” I ordered. 

Lights were ahead, bobbing like 
pastel ghosts in the fog. A man 
loomed up. He glanced at me, then 
through me; he nodded to Dunlap. 

“Already,” I said. 

“What?” 

“Forget it” 

But it was a blow. The police 
weren’t like the locals of the 
unions; they didn’t content them- 
selves with filing a protest and let- 
ting it get around to their own 
members. Now I was shunned by 
everyone; everyone in Grendoon 
would have seen my picture on the 
tri-V. 

“Turn in here, mister,” I told 
him, with my heart solid lead in- 
side me. 

The sign hanging from the tape 
wheeped faintly as we came close 
and its scanners picked us up, then 
blazed with the orange letters: 

TERRA CLUB 

We went in the door. 

The maitre-de greeted us af- 
fably, glad-to-see-you-tonight and 
all that. And then I moved into 
the light where he could get a bet- 
ter look at me and I was sud- 
denly a ghost. He couldn’t see 
me at all. 

I skinned out of my thermosuit, 



and Dunlap from his — but the 
check girl took his and there was 
nothing to do with mine but sling 
it over my shoulder. 

“Ask for a table for two, mister,” 
I said tightly. 

“I’d like a table. For two.” 
“The gentleman is expecting 
someone?” the maitre-de inquired 
politely. 

“Say yes, mister.” 

“Yes.” 

“Very well, sir.” The maitre-de 
led Dunlap down to a table right 
at the side of the dance floor. 
That was for me, that table, not 
for Dunlap. But Dunlap didn’t 
know that The maitre-de wanted 
it that way. He wanted me to be 
seen. I mean — no, not seen, but 
not-seen by everybody. So that 
everybody who was not-seeing me 
could get a good look. Good 
enough so that they would know 
enough never to see me again. 

r I ’ HE table was for two, all 
right, but it was only one chair 
that the maitre-de pulled out. I 
had to pull out my own. And 
when the waiter came, he only 
turned one glass right-side up, 
spread one napkin, offered one 
menu. 

I said: “Thank God for your 
brassard. Order me some scotch, 
mister. And a sandwich.” 

“Two scotches and a sandwich.” 
Dunlap looked at me. “Ham?” 
“Anything.”

“Ham, or whatever you’ve got.” 

The waiter looked at him, then 
shrugged. 

He brought the two scotches 
and the sandwich and lined them 
all up in front of Dunlap. 

I didn’t mind leaning across the 
table to get mine. I wolfed the 
sandwich; already I was hungry. 
Later it would be worse, but I 
wasn’t looking far ahead. I lifted 
my glass. 

“Confusion to our enemies.” 

Dunlap was acting more and 
more nervous. He said sullenly: 
“But I don’t know. I mean it’s 
more your enemy, isn’t it? I won- 
der if I really should get involved 
in a private disagreement.” 

“A private murder.” 

“All right, damn it! But this 
isn’t much fun and it’s costing me 
money.” 

“Money?” I reached in my 
pocket and tossed my wallet in 
front of him. He stared at me. 
“Keep it. It’s no good to me. Lit- 
erally. There isn’t a man in Gren- 
doon with something to sell who’ll 
sell it to me.” 

He looked thoughtful. He 
opened the wallet and whistled. 

“There’s a lot of dough here, 
buddy.” 

“What? Well, why not?” I swal- 
lowed the drink. “I worked for 
Quayle nearly six months. Out in 
the boondocks. Hard work, fighting 
off saposaurs, handling the pluto- 
nium. Ask Vince Borton — he was 



there working with me. Then—” 
“What then?” 

“I got to talking to Quayle’s 
wife. You saw her. Down at the 
Wallow.” 

Dunlap looked at me with a 
certain expression on his face. 

“All right,” I said. “She was his 
wife. But you don’t know him, 
mister! A rat. Made life hell for 
her. Rough to work for — you 
wouldn’t think he was conditioned, 
the language he uses. In town, he’d 
be shunned himself — but out on 
the fields customs are a little dif- 
ferent about giving offense. Es- 
pecially when the man giving 
offense is the boss.” 

He grumbled edgily: “But I 
don’t even know this Quayle!” 
“Now you do,” I told him, and 
pointed. “He’s just coming in.” 

Q UAYLE was a toad, with a 
toad’s face and features. 
Three men were with him — 
overseers from the farms, big men, 
rough and mean men, the kind 
that seemed to seek him out. And 
there was a woman, a woman in 
a scarlet dress. 

That would be Diane’s succes- 
sor. Trust Quayle! He wouldn’t go 
long without a woman, and always 
a beauty. Diane had been far 
from the first — only three of them 
he’d been married to, and she one 
of them; the other two had died 
out on the boondocks. Not in-quo- 
tation-marks “died”— one got in the 



114

way of a saposaur, the other dis- 
appeared in the swamps. That was 
how Quayle had got where he was, 
in fact— both of them had been 
rich, and he inherited. 

His filmed toad’s eyes went 
mildly around the room. 

He didn’t see me. It was very 
clear that he didn’t see me. After 
he was through not seeing me, he 
whispered something to one of the 
men, and the man snapped a 
finger for a waiter, and whispered 
to the waiter, and the waiter whis- 
pered back. 

And then Albert Quayle smiled 
a toadish smile. 

Oh, live a minute, that smile 
said. Live a minute longer; let 
yourself be sheltered by an Earth- 
man’s brassard. But he won’t stay 
forever. 

And then you’re dead. 

And Quayle was right, unless I 
found a way to handle it. 

The first thing was to get Dun- 
lap on my side. I had to show 
him what I was up against. 

“Order two more scotches,” I 
told him. 

While the waiter was gone, I 
whispered: “Listen close. You 

don’t believe that this shunning 
business can kill, do you? You 
think that simply ignoring a man 
can’t be fatal? Watch what hap- 
pens.” 

He scowled, almost as toadish 
a face as Quayle’s own. “Hold on, 
buddy! What are you up to? If 



you kill this guy Quayle or some- 
thing — ” 

“If I only could!” But then the 
waiter was back. 

I took one of the glasses out of 
the waiter’s hand. 

He just blinked once at the 
remaining glass, then calmly set it 
in front of Dunlap. “Sorry, sir,” he 
apologized. “You wanted two 
scotches, didn’t you? Ill get 
another.” 

“Now watch what happens.” I 
took the full glass and walked 
straight across the dance floor. 

No one bumped into me, though 
the band was playing and the floor 
was full. No one noticed that I 
was there. They danced neatly 
around a moving vacuum named 
me. 

I got to Quayle’s table and 
stood staring at him for a second. 
The woman moved nervously, but 
no one else gave any sign that a 
man was standing within a yard 
of them all. 

I shouted loudly: “Quayle!” 

There was no response, none at 
all. Only the woman blinked. 

“Quayle,” I cried, “you’re a rot- 
ten, stinking murderer! You’re 
snubbing me to death because I 
took your wife away from you!” 

And I threw the liquor in his 
face. 

He made sure to turn his head 
in time — raw alcohol bums — but 
that was all I could see. I fell 
writhing to the floor.

That’s the conditioning, you see. 
The muscles are there, and the 
brain can think murder; but once 
the thought becomes action, even 
if it is less than murder, if it is 
violence in any form — then the 
conditioned reflex snaps shut. 
Think of an iron maiden from 
Nuremberg, white-hot, the spikes 
closing in on you. Think of an 
epileptic fit. Think of being boiled 
alive. 

Combine them. 

Unfortunately, I did not lose 
consciousness, though the room 
spun madly around me and I 
couldn’t see anything but a tor- 
tured giant Quayle’s face mottled 
and furious, with the liquor slosh- 
ing down his ugly cheek. 

A FTER a few minutes, I got up 
painfully. 

The dancers had been all 
around me, but no foot had 
touched me; every person in the 
room must have seen and heard, 
but there was no sign. The music 
was playing. The Terra Club was 
gay and laughing. 

I walked shakily back to our 
table. 

Vince Borton was standing 
there, pleading with Dunlap for 
something; but his eyes were on 
me. “You damned fool! What do 
you think you were trying to 
prove?” 

“More scotch,” I said hoarsely. 

Dunlap pushed one of his 



glasses over. He looked shaken. 
“That was the conditioning?” 

I nodded. ' 

Vince said, “You’re crazy! Come 
out of here! I came to tell you 
something, but—” 

I cut in; “Imagine what it 
would have been if I’d tried to 
kill him.” 

“I can’t,” Dunlap admitted. 

“It would have killed me.” 

“It should have killed you!” 
Vince blazed. (And while we were 
shouting, all around us the Terra 
Club was having a party.) 

I said; “Vince. Please. Leave 
me alone.” 

Suddenly he calmed. “All right.” 
Then he said thoughtfully, “Listen. 
Funny thing. You know when you 
threw the liquor in Quayle’s face?” 

“Yes. I know.” 

“But do you know what he 
did?” He nodded, satisfied at my 
expression. “He started to go for 
you.” 

“But that’s not so strange,” Dim- 
lap protested. “Buddy here went 
for Quayle first.” 

“And then neither of them could 
follow through.” 

“Mmm. I see,” Dunlap said 
after a moment; but then he 
shrugged. “All right,” he said. 
“You’ve convinced me. You de- 
liberately let yourself in for that 
to prove a point, so I guess I 
have to say you’ve proved it. Now 
what?” 

“Help me, mister.”

“How?” 

“First I want to find my fiancee. 
I’ve got to. But I can’t talk to 
anyone, so you’ll have to—” 
“No, he won’t,” Borton inter- 
rupted. “That’s what I came to 
tell you.” 

“Tell me what?” 

“Where Diane is.” Borton fin- 
gered his ragged cap. “I heard 
from one of the other nobodies. 
You know how it is — misery loves 
company. When somebody new 
gets shunned, we all know it right 
away.” 

“And my fiancee?” 

He nodded. “Shunned. She’s 
over at the Wallow, on an island. 
And the water’s coming in and she 
can’t get anybody to help her.” 

VI 

O UTSIDE the Terra Club, I 
said: “Now I’ve got him! 
Quayle’s in the palm of my hand!” 
The hot fog closed in on all of 
us like a barber’s steamy towel. It 
seemed to make it difficult for 
Dunlap to breathe. He wheezed 
nervously: “What are you talking 
about?” 

The doorman glanced at him 
curiously, then away. Borton was 
almost treading on the man’s shoes, 
but the doorman didn’t know he 
was alive. 

“I’m talking about Quayle! This 
is the end of the road for him, I 
promise you. I didn’t want to do 



this, but he doesn’t leave me any 
choice. Now that I know where 
Diane is, I’m going to blow the 
lid off. We’ll go get her and then 
it’s the end for Quayle.” 

Dunlap clutched at his chest, 
knocking the brassard off his ther- 
mosuit. He bent and fumbled for 
it. When he stood up, he seemed 
a little steadier. 

“How?” he asked. 

“With a little help from the 
police, that’s how! Do you know 
what he’s been doing? He’s been 
smuggling steel knives to the sa- 
posaurs. I can prove it — with my 
fiancee’s help! It’s our ace in the 
hole.” 

“But, look. What does that have 
to do with you?” 

“Everything! Why do you think 
we were shunned, Dunlap? He’s 
behind it. He’s afraid. My fiancee 
knew all about it. She had to. But 
she wouldn’t have talked. And 
neither would I, because that was 
the way she wanted it. But now — ” 
“I know. Now you’re going to 
blow the lid off,” he said, jittering. 

“You bet we are. Once we let 
the truth out, he’s discredited — 
done. He’ll be a nobody then, not 
us. And then we can appeal our 
cases. The courts will listen. We’ll 
get the verdict reversed; they’ll 
believe me when I say I didn’t put 
the brassard on. The locals will let 
us off.” I grinned, as confidently 
as I could, although I was sweating 
more than hot fog could justify. 



SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES

“And the pity of it,” I said, “is 
that Quayle didn’t have to have 
it this way. We were willing to 
buy him off if necessary.” 

f I ''HEY both stood looking at me 
like saposaur chicks fresh out 
of the egg — puzzled, surprised, 
ready for a fight. 

“What the hell are you talking 
about?” Vince Borton asked me. 
“You don’t have anything Quayle 
wants, except Diane— and he won’t 
want her back. He just wants to 
get even with the two of you.” 
“That’s where you’re wrong, 
Vince. I told you. He bribes the 
saposaurs with steel knives, to go 
after the other plantations and 
leave his alone. But it takes a lot 
of knives. There are lots of sapo- 
saurs. And it’s against the law, of 
course.” 

“So?” 

“So he can’t get all the knives 
he wants,” I explained patiently. 
“But I can get them for him. 
Plenty! We talked about it, my 
fiancee and I; that was what we 
were going to offer him. But now 
— no. Now it’s war.” 

Dunlap said tenaciously: “Ex- 
plain that a little, will you? Where 
were you going to get them?” 

“I know where there’s a ship- 
load! Did you ever hear of the 
Formidable? Old Earth ship — oh, 
twenty-five years back. It crashed. 
They did that in those days. It 
missed Glendoon by twenty miles, 



smashed itself up and sank in 
forty feet of mud. But I know 
where it is.” 

I let that sink in, the way the 
old rocket had sunk into the 
greasy mud. 

“I found it while I was working 
for Quayle, digging his own drain- 
age ditches, blasting with his own 
plutonium. I thought of telling him 
about it. But I told my fiancee 
first and then the two of us — 
Well. Anyway, we didn’t tell him. 
And it’s loaded with knives. That 
was twenty-five years ago, you 
see. They used to try to trade with 
the saposaurs then.” 

Dunlap cleared his throat. “I, 
uh, I think I left my wallet at the 
table. Wait a minute, will you? I’ll 
be right back.” 

Vince Borton stared after him. 
Then, lowering his voice so that 
the unhearing doorman would 
really not hear, he blazed : “Oliver, 
you idiot! What’s the use of telling 
him all those lies?” 

“No, Vince. Don’t get me wrong. 
They’re only part lies. I do know 
where the Formidable crashed — 
but it isn’t forty feet of mud, it’s 
four hundred; and Quayle’s own 
thousand-acre drainage lake is 
right on top of it now. He’ll never 
recover it. But he’ll want those 
knives, as long as he thinks they 
can be had.” 

“So? Then why did you tell the 
Earthie about it? Why not tell 
Quayle?”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I stepped back to the entrance 
of the Terra Club. The noise of 
revelry was loud inside it, loud 
enough to drown out most of the 
distant dull roll of blasting. But I 
could see clearly through the 
double glass door. 

Even through the doors, across 
the crowded dance floor, I could 
see someone bending to talk to 
Albert Quayle. I could see Quayle’s 
look of worry, then the change of 
expression. 

Avarice gleamed out of his eyes, 
like golden glints from a pawn- 
broker’s sign. 

“Don’t worry, Vince,” I said 
softly. “Quayle knows.” 

TT wasn’t far to the Wallow. 

Vince Barton led us by the taped 
path to the water’s edge. We were 
quiet, especially Dunlap. 

The torches were gone. Most of 
the people were gone. Only scat- 
tered couples and groups were left, 
often drunk, all invisible in the 
clotted fog. The thick water in the 
Wallow had risen to the very edge 
of the tapewalk. 

“Under here.” Vince held the 
tape for us. We stepped off into 
sucking mud. The distant rumble 
of explosions was still drumming 
at the horizons. Venus is an enor- 
mous planet, no oceans, just 
swamps, so it’s bigger in land 
area than four Earths; there is 
much blasting to be done, and the 
sound of plutonium carries. 



But above the distant boom, in 
a moment I heard something else. 

A thin, distant voice cut like 
piano wire at my heart. Out in the 
middle of the Wallow Diane, in- 
visible, was moaning. “Help me! 
Please — please — the water’s get- 
ting higher!” 

And there were people within 
the sound of her voice — a good 
many, though most had left — and 
they had boats if they chose to 
use them. But she wasn’t there for 
them. She was nobody. A ghost. 
If anyone knew she was alive, 
there was no sign shown. 

“Mister. Get a boat.” 

He looked at me. 

“Go ahead, man. Ask someone 
— - anybody. They’ll lend it to 
you, because you’re wearing the 
brassard. But they won’t talk to 
Borton or me.” 

He trudged off, muttering his 
worried disapproval. 

As soon as he had disappeared 
into the fog, I said: “All right, 
Vince. You remember what I told 
you in front of the Club. Now do 
it!” 

“Aw, Oliver! You’re crazy! Do 
you know what you’re getting 
into?” 

“Do you want to be shunned all 
the little rest of your life?” 

He grunted once and walked 
away. But I knew 'he didn’t 
approve. 

That didn’t matter. What mat- 
tered was Diane and life.

So now I was all alone in the 
hot slimy fog, with Diane’s distant 
sobs tearing at me. I wanted to 
call to her, only there was a reason 
for not doing it. 

But time was passing. 

r | 1 HE Wallow was filling rapidly 
now with the run-off from the 
hills. The air was twenty degrees 
colder. Still hot — terribly hot, by 
Earth standards; but as our por- 
tion of Venus rolled into shadow, 
water was wrung out of the sodden 
air, and it had to go somewhere. 
Now the Wallow was a hundred 
acres of steaming muddy water. 
All that was left of the red mud 
of six hours before was a few 
islands poking up. Diane was on 
one of them. But in a while, 
maybe a very short while, all of 
the islands would disappear. By 
full flood time, the shallowest point 
in the Wallow would be sixty feet 
deep. 

And it was not merely drowning y 
that endangered her. That water 
was hot. 

Time was passing — 

Then I heard Dunlap’s wheezing 
breath, and a moment later the 
thunk of his oars moving blindly 
toward me in the fog. 

“Here!” I yelled. 

He found me. 

I scrambled aboard, and we 
rowed clumsily out on the soupy 
lake, following the sound of Diane’s 
sobbing voice. 



SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES

S HE cried unbelievingly: “Dar- 
ling!” 

I clutched at her in the mist. It 
was like Leander embracing Hero, 
still wet from the raging Helles- 
pont; it was the meaning and pur- 
pose of all my life. 

Then I felt her go suddenly 
tense. 

She strained to see through the 
hot fog. In a voice that cracked a 
little, she said: “It’s — if s the 

Earthie.” 

I looked around politely. 

Dunlap was standing there in 
an awkward, embarrassed stance. 
His face was half turned away. 

He cleared his throat. “I can 
explain,” he apologized. 

“Explain what, mister?” 

He felt his throat. “I mean I 
was afraid she’d take this attitude. 
I knew she wouldn’t understand 
about what happened. Here I am 
trying to help you and — 

“What did happen, mister?” 
Diane said furiously: “He’s the 
one! He got you away on purpose! 
And then the fog closed in, re- 
member? And somebody grabbed 
me. Grabbed me!” 

“I know, dear.” 

“But it was physical! Only an 
Earthie could have done it and he 
was the only Earthie in sight. He 
grabbed me and brought me out 
here on a boat. And left me. And 
then somebody came by and I 
called to them and — they 
shunned me, darling! He did it!” 



“But it wasn’t me, I swear. Ask 
your friend here! I was with him, 
wasn’t I?” 

“You were with me for about 
three minutes.” I patted his arm 
with my free hand. “But you didn’t 
do it,” I reassured him. “I know 
that. It wasn’t him, darling.” 

“Then who-” 

I stopped her: “Be patient, dear. 
Just for a few moments.” 

We stood there. 

r 1 1 HEN there were voices in the 
fog. A boat’s oars. And then a 
familiar whining voice, droning the 
nobody’s familiar whimpering cry. 
“Mister? Please, mister. I haven’t 
eaten in three days—” 

“Vince!” I shouted. “Here we 
are.” 

He came up out of the fog, 
looked us over and nodded. Behind 
him there were other figures in the 
fog. 

“Who the devil are they?” Dun- 
lap demanded, fingering his bras- 
sard. 

“Nobody,” I told him. “Nobody 
at all.” 

There were four of them, ghost- 
ly in the mist. In the fog, they had 
no faces, only vague mottled 
shapes, and faint voices that 
agreed: “Nobody, mister. Just 

nobody.” 

“But maybe,” I said steadily, 
“they won’t be nobodies forever. 
Maybe soon they’ll be somebodies 
again.” 



122

"rk UNLAP shouted horsely: “I 
don’t know what you’re try- 
ing to pull, Oliver, but I don’t like 
it I’m getting out of here!” 

I stood in front of him. “How 
did you know my name was 
Oliver?” 

He rocked back, staring. 
“What?” 

“I never told you my name. We 
weren’t properly introduced.” 

“A visitor wouldn’t know that—” 

“And he wouldn’t know my 
name either. Other people wouldn’t 
use it in front of him without 
proper introductions. That would 
be cause for offense.” 

“But 

“Never mind.” I raised my voice. 
“Quayle! Come on out here. I 
know you’re on the island. You 
wouldn’t miss a chance to get 
knives — besides, I heard your ca- 
noe.” 

A moment, while Dunlap’s face 
turned to melting butter. 

Then there was a soft, sludgy 
sound of footsteps in the mud. 
Albert Quayle walked steadily up 
to us, his fat toad’s face a mask. 
He glanced at Dunlap, and even 
in the drenching heat of that little 
island in the Wallow, Dunlap 
shuddered. 

Then Quayle turned to me. He 
waited. 

I said cheerfully: “We’re ready, 
I think. Quayle, here. Dunlap, 
here. Diane and myself, here. Bor- 
ton and the witnesses—” 



“Witnesses?” Quayle’s lips didn’t 
move; only the word popped out 
of the fog and hung there between 
us. 

“To a murder, Quayle. Yours. 
You’re going to die.” 

“Ha!” He was contemptuous. 
“You can’t kill me. I’m an im- 
portant man here, Oliver. Who’s 
going to shun me on your say-so?” 
I paused. “There are other ways 
of killing,” I said softly. 

He didn’t move a muscle. I let 
him think for a second. Then I 
said: “Vince, have you got what 
I asked for?” 

He passed me something cold 
and sharp. It was hard to make 
out in the fog but I knew what it 
was; and then I held it up and 
they all knew. 

“A knife, Quayle!” I said. “It’s 
what you want, isn’t it? A knife to 
bribe a saposaur to wreck some- 
body else’s plantation. That’s what 
brought you here, and now you 
can have this one, at least!” 

He stood frozen. I took a second 
to turn to Diane. “Good-by,” I 
whispered. She didn’t know what 
I meant by that, but it was all 
right. If it turned out that she had 
to know, she would know. 

And then I said loudly to 
Quayle: “I’m going to give you 
the knife— where it belongs. You 
put too much trust in conditioning, 
thinking I can’t use this. But 
maybe you’re wrong.” 

He licked his lips. 



SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES 



123 



“Did you ever hear of a bribe?” 
I demanded. “Ever hear of a man 
who was supposed to be condi- 
tioned— but wasn’t? Well, you’re 
looking at one and now, Quayle, 
here’s your knife.” 

And I tensed, and fought my 
own body to do it, and I jumped 
for him, the knife raised to plunge 
into his breast. 

And that was the last I saw. I 
fell senseless to the ground, be- 
cause, you see, what I had just 
told him had been an utter lie. 

"OUT I came to, very slowly and 
-*-* with much pain. 

A long time had passed. 

I hurt in places where I’d never 
known there was a nerve. I was 
weaker than any living man has a 
right to be. 

But I was alive. 

That was all I needed to know. 
If I was alive, everything was all 
right; that was the gamble I had 
taken. The conditioning doesn’t 
prevent, not quite. It only pun- 
ishes. I had sought out that pun- 
ishment as a bluff; but it was a 
bluff that could easily have killed 
me. 

Diane was leaning over me. 
Blearily I focused on her face. 
Her scent was musky, her expres- 
sion calm and passionate. “Oliver,” 
she murmured. “You’re all right. 
Don’t worry.” 

“I know,” I whispered. “At least 
I lived through it. That was the 



hard part — but worth it all.” 

I rubbed my face. There was 
heavy stubble on it; I had been 
unconscious at least a full day. I 
was in a hospital room. 

“You didn’t kill Quayle with the 
knife.” 

“No. The attempt was bad 
enough. If I’d succeeded, there 
would have been no chances at 
all; the conditioning would have 
killed me.” 

She looked at me with a glance 
of wonder and loving admiration. 
“You knew exactly what was going 
to happen, didn’t you? When you 
said all that about a man bribing 
the immigration people to get in 
without being conditioned, it was 
Quayle you were talking about, 
wasn’t it?” 

I nodded. 

“You were right. He wasn’t 
conditioned. He—” She shivered. 
“He killed his first two wives, 
Oliver. Did you know that? But 
I guess you did. For their inheri- 
tance. And he killed others to get 
them out of the way. He confessed 
it all, once it was too late and they’d 
begun to shun him. And he was the 
one who grabbed me in the fog — 
from behind, so I couldn’t see his 
face. And then when you went at 
him with the knife—” 

“I know.” I nodded again, be- 
ginning to feel better. “He hit me, 
proving that he wasn’t con- 
ditioned.” 

“That’s right. And with Vince

there was no doubt. The police 
listened to them. Vince was 
framed — Albert admitted it.” 

“I know.” 

“And Dunlap? Did you know 
about him? He wasn’t an Earthie; 
he was from one of the South Pole 
cities, working for Quayle, running 
in knives for trade with the sapo- 
saurs.” 

“I know. When he called me 
Oliver, I knew for sure, but I’d 
wondered since that scene in the 
Club. He didn’t tell me what 



Quayle had done when I threw 
the drink in his face — tried to hit 
me then, too, and didn’t pass out. 
Vince Borton had to tell me about 
it. Then there was the brassard — 
Dunlap must have done it, if the 
cop didn’t, and it had to be one 
or the other.” 

Diane leaned forward. “It’s all 
right now,” she said huskily. “We 
can forget. Oliver, you’re wonder- 
ful!” 

I said, reaching out to her: “I 
know.”

ANY IMPROVEMENT? 

We asked last year how communities were doing for supplies of 
Galaxy — adequate or inadequate numbers of copies, regular or 
irregular distribution? 

Readers wrote in. A lot of them. 

The result was remarkably like a revised battle plan. Reserve 
copies were sped into lightly held towns. Fortified positions that 
had held out against science fiction were breeched. Copies were 
liberated from under-the-counter concealment and put in the front 
lines. 

Everybody benefited, and our thanks to those reader-scouts 
who did a terrain-mapping job that we could never have done on 
our own. 

But that was a year ago. How are things now?

CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY 
by Robert A. Heinlein, Charles 
Scribner’s Sons, N. Y., $2.95 

A T first, it appeared that Hein- 
lein had fallen over the same 
fallacy that afflicted the van Vogt 
post-atomic series: extreme tech- 
nological skill in a primitive so- 
ciety. Starting his story in a slave 
market, Heinlein soon makes his 
point that even in so-called en- 
lightened eras in history, frontiers 
always brought slavery into being. 
In Sargon, capital of the Nine 
Worlds, sedan chairs toted by 
slaves are a mark of elegance. 



Thorby, a young, fiercely rebel- 
lious boy, is auctioned to an old 
one-legged beggar who refuses to 
be his master. In actuality, he has 
rescued the boy from slavery. He 
teaches Thorby languages, con- 
centration and retention. 

Although their sole income is 
from alms, it is soon evident to 
Thorby that Baslim is far from 
being solely a beggar. This is 
proved forcefully one day when 
Baslim disappears and Thorby is 
hounded into hiding by the police. 
In accord with the old man’s in- 
structions, he manages to locate 
the skipper of a spaceship of the 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Free Traders and to repeat a hyp- 
notically memorized message from 
the old beggar. 

As foster son of Baslim, to whom 
the Traders owe a debt of honor, 
Thorby is accepted as one of the 
People, subject to their codes and 
taboos. Here, Heinlein gives an 
accurate and detailed anthropolog- 
ical picture of a small isolated 
culture, practicing both exogamy 
and endogamy as well as being a 
patrilocal matriarchy. 

Sounds frightening, but it’s a 
humanities course in one easy les- 
son. 

Thorby’s actual identity is a bit 
startling, but Heinlein is invariably 
logical. And invariably entertain- 
ing, I might add, even when en- 
gaged in a crusade against future 
slavery. 

A STIR OF ECHOES by Richard 
Matheson. J. B. Lippincott Co., 
Phila., $3.00 

"D OBINSON’S Power and 
-*•*- Maine’s Isotope Man preced- 
ed Matheson’s in Lippincott’s 
“Novel of Menace” series. Like 
Power, Stir of Echoes qualifies in 
full. Matheson expertly builds a 
mood of horror and terror that 
only on one occasion exceeds cre- 
dulity. 

After a jocose opening, which 
nevertheless fits the spirit of the 
parlor-game hypnosis stunt that 
precipitates the action, the story 



becomes taut and gripping. Tom 
Wallace is the scoffing subject of 
his college-student brother-in-law 
at one of neighbor Elsie’s deadly 
dull parties. Incredibly, he goes 
under. 

The repercussions begin later, 
however, as a result of the hypno- 
tist freeing and uninhibiting his 
mind. That night, he sees a ghostly 
woman in black. He later finds 
that he possesses either clairvoy- 
ance or low telepathy. He is aware 
of imminent or impending death. 
He cannot read thoughts, but is 
susceptible to and overwhelmed by 
raw emotion. His life becomes a 
complete nightmare because his 
newfound gift is completely uncon- 
trollable and unpredictable. 

Matheson rides the nightmare 
to the finish line in a lather of cold 
sweat.

eral interest in matters of

WASP by Eric Frank Russell. 
Avalon Books, N. Y., $2.75 

"DUSSELL, old pro, has a real 
sleeper here. He draws on his 
wartime experience in the British 
Army and the almost incredible 
feats of British Intelligence in the 
darkest days of WW II when 
Britain could only sting its enemy. 

The Sirian Combine and Terra 
are at war and, although inferior 
technologically, Sirius has an over- 
whelming numerical advantage — 
so much so that Terra is forced 
to adopt the Wasp technique. 

James Mowry, Wasp, was born 
and spent his first seventeen years 
on Sirian Diracta. Special train- 
ing, pigmentation and surgery en- 
able him to pass as Sirian on 
planet Jaimec where he is to sting 
the planetary officials by one-man 
sabotage, rumor-mongering and as- 
sassination into crediting existence 
of a widespread underground anti- 
war organization. 

Russell has invested this hard- 
boiled yarn with plenty of action 
and authenticity. A fine light 
opera. 

ONCE AROUND THE SUN by 
Ronald Fraser. The Macmillan 
Co., N. Y., $3.95 



HT'HE IGY program is a com- 
plicated enterprise, and Dr. 
Fraser as Administrative Secretary 
of the International Council of Sci- 
entific Unions, worldwide sponsor 
of the IGY, has the inside track 
on information about it. 

The title is a misnomer — the 
IGY was chosen for maximum sun- 
spot activity, a period of eighteen 
months. 

A glance at the contents page 
alone sets the head spinning with 
the ramifications of the program. 
Part I “On the Boundaries of the 
Known World” subheads the 
Earth’s size and shape, magnetic 
fields, wandering poles, atmos- 
pheric jet streams, ocean current, 
the night airglow and chemistry of 
the atmosphere, the atmospheric 
heat engine and multiple etcs. Part 
II, “Toward New Horizons,” cate- 
gorizes the areas of cooperation 
among the nations for the purpose 
of extending knowledge of Part I. 

Jampacked with data and ex- 
planation, ORTS is virtually a 
handbook of the IGY.

“Lorelei of the Red Mist” by 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Bradbury and Brackett is the oper- 
atic result of a barely post-war 
collaboration, when neither of 
these talents had jelled into pres- 
ent solidity. It is a pleasant super- 
fantasy-adventure on Venus in a 
more-so mood of Burroughs and 
Kline. 

“The Golden Helix” by Stur- 
geon is an account of the estab- 
lishment of a star colony by three 
couples who awaken from sus- 
pended animation to find them- 
selves either the pawns or the gods 
of a mysterious race. The story 
has the moments of poetry to be 
found in any Sturgeon work but 
doesn’t rank as real Sturgeon. 

“Destination Moon” by Hein- 
lein more than makes up for the 
minor shortcomings of the other 
yarns. This masterpiece of film 
and print still has immense emo- 
tional impact and credibility and is 
of redoubled interest now that the 
Age of Space has truly dawned.

QPUTNIK’S prime effect was to 
^ spotlight the inadequacies of 
American education. To supple- 
ment formal study, I will present 
monthly reviews of noteworthy 
items. 

The three books above are 
excellently done popularizations 
in narrative form, full of palatable 
information, experiments and il- 
lustrations. 

Randy Morrow, brother Sam 
and their science-writer father car- 
ry the thread of story continuity 
in each volume. In Chemistry, the 
boy’s carbide lamp fails at a spe- 
lunking outing. A recommended 
local chemist is a teen-aged girl 
who teaches Randy chemical fun- 
damentals. In Electronics, Randy 
overcomes the animosity of a mal- 
adjusted young ham operator. 
Atomic Energy sees the boys visit 
Argonne National Laboratory. 

My only quibble is the empha- 
sis on these being boys’ books. By 
actual test, I have found them to 
be of equal interest to teen-age 
girls. 

If Popular Mechanics intends, 
as I hope, to make this a series, 
they have set a genuinely high 
and meritorious standard for them- 
selves.

AND WHITE 



By j. t. McIntosh 

To poke loopholes in galactic 
law, never advertise what you 
are selling ... so you can sell 
what you are not advertising! 

Illustrated by MARTINEZ 



1 LOOKED in the tank and 
shuddered. My lovely wife 
Rogan was turning into some- 
thing I couldn’t look at for long 
without getting sick. I decided not 
to risk looking in there again. 

Ped was in the control sphere 
playing with a black and white 
board and a lot of little disks. I’d 
seen him at it before. 

“What’s this?” I inquired. 
“Game I picked up on Earth. 
Checkers.” 



“It isn’t in the spools,” I ac- 
cused. 

“Is. You haven’t digested them 
all,” he accused back. 

“I still have two to go,” I ad- 
mitted. “Is the game any good?” 

He showed me. It was very 
simple. I said so, wondering what 
he saw in it. 

“Try,” he said, indicating the 
white discs. 

I made a move. He made one. 
I made another. 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“See?” he said. 

I had to take a piece. He took 
two. I had to take another. He 
moved. I took another. He moved 
again. I took one more. 

Having got me exactly where 
he wanted me, he wiped me off 
the board. 

“I see,” I said. “The rule about 
capture makes it. Think it’ll go in 
the Twenty Worlds?” 

“Can try,” said Ped. He pushed 
the board away. “What are you 
trying to sell on this planet?” 

“Nothing much,” I said. 

Ped spat I winced. He was an 
old man with a lot of nasty habits 
he’d picked up on the umpteen 
worlds on which he’d been the 
first Vigintan. But I had to put 
up with him, nasty habits and all, 
because I knew of nobody with 
one-tenth his talent in his own valu- 
able line. 

How many people could land 
on an alien world about which 
nobody knew anything and leave 
it six months later with complete 
knowledge of the language, cus- 
toms and physical structure of the 
principal race? And no unsolved 
crime left on the planet, either, 
or suspicion among the highest 
creatures of the world concerned 
that an alien had been among 
them. 

“You know the law,” I said 
virtuously. “We can’t exploit this 
or any other unaffiliated world.” 

“I know it,” he said skeptically. 



A NYWAY, it was none of Ped’s 
business. He was retained 
simply to teach us enough for us 
to pass as natives. Rogan and I 
wouldn’t have had a hope landing 
on our own, without Ped’s expert 
preliminary work. 

“What do you sell, usually?” 
he asked. 

“Ergeron,” I said, knowing he 
could find out, anyway. 

“What’s that?” 

“It powers this ship.” 

“Oh,” he said. “Well, they’re a 
long way from that Two centuries 
at least. They’ll go to their moon 
any day, and the planets the fol- 
lowing week. But deep space . 
they won’t be buying ergeron for 
three centuries at least.” 

“Well, I guess my company will 
still be around in three centuries,” 
I said. “And they’ll still have to 
use ergeron. It’s the only way, 
theoretically.” 

He spat again. I decided to ter- 
minate this conversation pretty 
quickly. I didn’t like the turn it 
was taking. 

“What are you selling now?” he 
asked. 

“I don’t know.” Before he spat 
again, which seemed to be his un- 
hygienic way of saying “I don’t 
believe you,” I went on hastily: 
“That is, I don’t know what we’re 
going to call it. What we’re going 
to say it will do, I guess.” 

“You mean it won’t do it?” 

“No, it’ll do what we say.” I

turned away. “If I digest the other 
two spools now, can you get the 
metabolism change started?” 

“Right away. Your wife should 
be pretty well along.” 

I shuddered again. “She is. I 
looked.” 

“Wait,” he said. “One thing you’d 
better know. It’s not on the spools. 
It’s no more than a hunch about 
these people.” 

“Think I’d better hear it, if it’s 
only a hunch?” 

“Obviously. You’re going to do 
something good? Bad?” 

“Good, I’d say.” 

“Naturally you’d say.” He spat. 
But this time I was a long way 
away. “Remember this. These peo- 
ple see things in black and white. 
No grays. You’re a friend, every- 
thing you do is fine. You’re an 
enemy, nothing you ever do can 
be right They like you, you’re 
in. They hate you, you’re outside 
for good.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “That may be 
useful. We should convince them 
at all costs that what we’re doing 
is good?” 

“You’d better,” said Ped. 

TVTEXT time I saw Rogan, things 
-L ’ were different. I was one of 
the things that were different, and 
that made a big difference in the 
way she looked to me. Now it 
was Ped who made us both sick. 

We didn’t have to look at him, 
but we had to smell him. It was a 

132 



pity that the two species, Terran 
human and Vigintan, could use 
the same atmosphere and tempera- 
ture range. Being Terran and be- 
ing in the same room with a Vigin- 
tan was an experience we could 
have done without. 

Like and dislike are a lot more 
physical than you know until 
you’ve made a body-change. I’d 
seen Rogan as a Terran and I’d 
been sick — but that was when I 
was Vigintan. Now that we were 
both Terran, she was wonderful, 
far more beautiful than when we 
were both Vigintan. That meant 
sex was a stronger impulse on 
Earth than on the Twenty Worlds. 

Rogan was thinking the same 
thing. She murmured: “This is go- 
ing to be interesting. On some 
worlds, sex is nice; on other worlds, 
it’s nasty; but on any world there’s 
nothing quite like it.” 

“Where there is sex, that is,” 
I remarked. 

“Where there isn’t, I don’t go. 
I have better things to do than be 
a neuter.” 

“When do you want me to come 
back for you?” Ped interrupted. 
We spoke English, he Vigintan— 
it was easier that way. 

I reflected. “How much local 
currency did you say you’d col- 
lected for us?” 

“Ten thousand dollars.” 

I checked that against what I’d 
learned from the spools. “Which 
isn’t exactly a fortune.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Best I could do.” 

“Well have to start in a small 
way. I guess well need six weeks.” 
I wanted so much to get away from 
the Vigintan smell that I could 
hardly think straight. We should 
have fixed all this before making 
the body-changes — or made Ped 
resume his Terr an shape. 

“Think six weeks will be 
enough?” Ped asked. 

“Yes. Let’s go, Rogan.” 

“Haven’t you forgotten some- 
thing?” Ped asked mildly. 

“I don’t think so.” 

“They wear clothes on this 
planet.” 

T groaned. “We’ll put them on 
in the landing car,” I said. 
“It couldn’t be that you don’t like 
my company?” Ped inquired. 

“I hate to say this,” I said, “but 
you stink.” 

“So do you,” said Ped, unruffled. 
“Both of you. Also, you look—” 

“I know,” I said hastily. “Vigin- 
tans and humans are different. 
Let’s leave it at that” 

I shut the door behind us. Al- 
most at once, the landing car’s air 
refiner swirled away the last traces 
of Vigintan scent — though to call 
it that is to flatter it — and we 
breathed delicious clean air. 

“We don’t know how to wear 
these things,” Rogan objected, stir- 
ring the little pile of clothes with 
her foot. ‘We should have let him 
show us.” 



“I know,” I said, “but I couldn’t 
stand it any longer.” 

“I know what you mean,” she 
said feelingly. 

The little car was falling away 
from the parent ship. It was time 
to make ourselves into civilized 
Terrans. 

We knew a lot about Earth 
from the spools we’d digested, but 
that was all theoretical, and put- 
ting clothes on is practical. Though 
Rogan knew what the little wisps 
of white nylon were meant to be, 
it needed quite a lot of experimen- 
tation to get them on right. Imagine 
putting on a brassiere for the first 
time, when you haven’t seen any- 
body putting one on, or wearing 
one. We kept putting things on 
back to front, and telling each 
other doubtfully: “I’m sure that 
can’t be right.” 

However, when Rogan looked 
at last as if her dress had been 
painted on her, we were sure that 
might be right Funny how back- 
ward peoples can think of things 
that escape far more advanced 
races — zip-fasteners are wonder- 
ful, and when we sell the idea in 
the Twenty Worlds, it’ll pay for 
the trip twice over. That’s if Ped 
hasn’t sold it first. 

My clothes gave me less trouble, 
once I had figured one thing out 
Rogan’s fastenings were all at the 
back, which gave us the idea all 
mine must be too, only they 
weren’t. My clothes were pretty 



I N BLACK AND WHITE 



133 



crumpled by the time I’d estab- 
lished that. 

By then, we had landed in the 
spot Ped had picked — soft soil 
four hundred yards from a high- 
way two miles outside a small 
town called Gelland. We got out 
and set the landing car to dig 
itself in. Half an hour later, there 
was only a big patch of darker 
soil to show where it was, and that 
wouldn’t last long under a hot sun. 

We took careful bearings, picked 
our way to the road and started to 
walk to Gelland. 

TESUS, it’s hot,” said Rogan. 

“You’re not supposed to say 
that,” I reminded her. 

“Am I just supposed to fry in 
silence?” 

“Not that. Women don’t say 
‘Jesus’.” 

“But it’s part of the local re- 
ligion. Aren’t women supposed to 
be religious?” 

“You didn’t digest spool eight,” 
I said accusingly. 

“I did too. I know women aren’t 
supposed to say ‘Jesus,’ and — and 
— but the spool didn’t say why not. 
I don’t think it’s fair that men 
should be able to use some words 
and women shouldn’t. Most of 
them are very useful words. Any- 
way, I’m going to take this dress 
off.” 

“You can’t. Didn’t you digest 
spool three?” 

Rogan sulked. 



Those references to digesting 
data may be misleading because 
it is also a Terran idiom. That, 
however, is only a metaphor; we 
really digest information — we eat 
it. Some long-ago genius — I don’t 
know if he was Vigintan or there 
was a Vigintan middleman in- 
volved — couldn’t see why it had 
to be a metaphor and experi- 
mented till he came up with an 
edible neuron tape onto which in- 
formation could be — well, fed — 
and the tape — how else can I ex- 
press it? — fed directly into the 
brain. Easy, cheap, permanent. 

We saw a tall, yellow-haired 
youth ambling along the highway 
in our direction and braced our- 
selves for our first effort to con- 
vince a human that we were 
human. 

“Excuse me, sir,” I said. 

He stopped, but looked sur- 
prised. “Why? You ain’t done 
nothin’,” he said. 

Hastily I checked back, and 
there it was. On accosting a 
stranger, say, “Excuse me, sir or 
madam, as the case may be.” 
Damn Ped. He’d got it wrong. 

“How do you know?” demanded 
Rogan, unable to leave well enough 
alone. 

Curiously enough, this seemed 
to be the right thing to say. The 
yellow-haired youth grinned, and 
it seemed we were all right 

“Does this road go anywhere?” 
I asked. 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Now I knew as I said it that 
that wasn’t quite right. I should 
have said something like “How 
far to the next town?” But there 
was no need for this character to 
say: 

“Naw. I been watching it all 
day and it ain’t moved yet.” 

VW/E had been unlucky enough 
” to meet a humorist. We pos- 
sess a sense of humor too, but 
there was no telling if it was the 
same. As a matter of fact, it is, 
more or less, but we didn’t know 
that then. 

“How far to the next town?” I 
asked warily. 

“Three miles,” he said. “Maybe 
four.” 

Rogan turned to me resentfully. 
“Ped said it was only—” 

I dug her in the ribs. “Thanks,” 
I said to the youth. 

“Think nothin’ of it.” 

“I won’t,” I assured him cour- 
teously. 

He stared at us and moved 
slowly on. 

“I wonder what we did wrong,” 
I mused when I was sure he 
couldn’t hear me. 

“I know what we did wrong,” 
Rogan complained. “Trusting that 
Ped! Three miles — that’s about 
six thousand five hundred of these 
steps . Jesus!” 

“I told you not to say that.” 

She said a coarser word. “If it’s 
actually that far, I am not going to 



carry this ridiculous extra weight,” 
she declared. 

She took off her dress. 

Almost immediately a car, the 
first we’d seen — naturally Ped had 
picked a very quiet roadway — 
came up behind us, went past us 
swerving all over the road with 
three faces goggling at us and 
came to a halt about two hundred 
yards further on. Before we 
reached it, however, a woman got 
out of the back seat, pushed over 
the man in the driving seat and 
drove off. 

• “Well, what do you know about 
that?” said Rogan. 

“If you don’t put your dress 
back on,” I said grimly, “I will.” 
“Idiot,” she retorted. “You’d 
never get into it.” 

“Refer to spool seven,” I said. 
“When to wear which clothes.” 

“I was half asleep when I di- 
gested that,” she admitted. “Oh, 
well, I guess you’re right. Zip me 
up the back.” 

T HERE were a lot more mis- 
takes we made, but a couple 
of days later we were past the 
worst. We knew that if people 
looked old-fashioned at us, we 
just had to pretend it was all a 
joke, and we knew that almost 
anything Rogan said was regarded 
as a joke anyway. We knew that 
the yellow-haired youth had stared 
because people don’t walk along 
a highway dressed as we were and 



I N BLACK AND WHITE 



135 



not carrying anything. We knew 
that if we’d said our car was out 
of gas, he’d have been satisfied — 
only that might have landed us in 
trouble too, when we failed to 
produce a car, so perhaps it was 
just as well that we hadn’t made 
any explanations. 

We took a hotel room — not the 
first we tried; the second. It was a 
pity about that first hotel. Ped 
had told us about wedding rings, 
and made one when he made the 
clothes, but Rogan had forgotten 
to put it on. It was probably still 
on the floor of the landing car. • 

A T the second hotel, there was 
no trouble. 

The first thing was to make some 
of the stuff I’d developed on the 
ship and find a name for it. We 
wanted to call it Elixir of Life, but 
found that had been used. Every 
name we thought of had already 
been used. 

Then Rogan read a wonderful 
book called Alice in Wonderland 
and we decided to call it simply 
Drink Me. 

There were difficulties in mak- 
ing Drink Me, and not the ones 
I’d expected. It wasn’t in the least 
difficult to get chemicals and drugs; 
the trouble was that they weren’t 
quite what I expected when I got 
them. Standards were different, 
but I’d anticipated that. What 
I had not considered were the 
impurities. 



Seems obvious, but I hadn’t 
realized that what a chemist calls 
impurities are quite arbitrary, and 
different in every culture. Iodine is 
an impurity in salt if you don’t 
want it. So are air, water, oxygen, 
hydrogen, carbon, in anything. I 
kept finding that human chemists 
had gone to enormous trouble to 
remove from this or that something 
that I wanted left in, and hadn’t 
bothered about something else that 
I wanted left out. 

Water was worst of all. On my 
home planet, we seldom bother to 
distill water; consequently, our 
standard is undistilled water. 
Shocking chemistry on Earth, I 
know. Trouble was, neither fresh 
water nor distilled water reacted 
quite the way I wanted, and I had 
to go to a lot of trouble to intro- 
duce the proper impurities. 

“Call yourself a chemist,” said 
Roger derisively, while I sweated 
blood. 

Despite the difficulties, I had a 
couple of dozen bottles of Drink 
Me ready in a day or two. Then 
we saw a lawyer and fixed up the 
legal side. That was easy, because 
we didn’t care much about exclu- 
sive rights. 

That puzzled him a lot. 

I couldn’t very well explain that 
after a week or two we weren’t go- 
ing to be around to collect the cash, 
so we didn’t care who got it. 

I had a few thousand labels 
printed. They said:

DRINK ME 

for Coughs 
Colds 
Catarrh 
Bronchitis 
Asthma 
Headaches 
etc. 

In small type, the formula was 
given, but there was a warning that 
the manner of preparation was im- 
portant. If an ordinary Earth 
chemist made it up according to 
the given formula, the result would 
be harmless but wouldn’t work. 

On the Twenty Worlds, we’re 
not geniuses and we don’t know 
everything. In biology, however, 
we have practically all the an- 
swers. Making ourselves Terran 
bodies was just one of our party 
tricks. The elixir was another. With 
the information Ped had brought 
back, it had been child’s play for 
me to throw Drink Me together. 

Getting it on the market wasn’t 
nearly so easy. After buying clothes 
and things, and living expenses, we 
only had seven thousand dollars 
left. 

“A real Elixir of Life and we 
can’t sell it,” Rogan sneered. 

“We haven’t tried yet. You’re 
the saleswoman.” 

She perked up at that. She’d had 
nothing to do so far. “What do I 
do?” she asked. “How do you sell 
things here?” 

Unfortunately, we didn’t quite 



know. We could have hired some- 
body to sell the stuff for us, if only 
we’d known whom to hire. But 
things are awkward when you’re in 
a _ strange land, no matter how 
much theoretical knowledge you 
have about it. 

What we eventually did was 
this. Rogan made the rounds of 
the various drugstores in town, 
buying aspirin or bromides or 
paperback books, until she found 
an owner who had a heavy asth- 
matic wheeze. It had to be an 
owner, of course.- Then she told 
him brightly there was no need to 
wheeze like that. She was travel- 
ing for a firm which had made 
asthma prehistoric. 

“Just try this,” she said, pro- 
ducing the bottle. “I’ll be back in 
a couple of hours.” 

“Hey, wait a minute,” wheezed 
E. Levitski, Prop. But Rogan was 
gone. 

When she went back, his asthma 
had completely gone. 

“It was too easy,” she told me 
later. “He fell over himself to buy 
a couple of gross. What’s a gross?” 

I explained as I made up the 
couple of gross. We delivered them. 

“Now what do we do?” Rogan 
asked. 

“We take a holiday,” I said. 
“This job is finished, honey.” 

¥¥7E spent a couple of weeks 
” having fun in our part of 
Earth. There were forests, lakes 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and rivers, and we liked it all. We 
weren’t much interested in the peo- 
ple everywhere. Every town in the 
Galaxy is full of people. 

But we liked the fishing and we 
liked bathing. 

Bathing — now there’s some- 
thing. 

Nobody on the Twenty Worlds 
has ever willingly immersed him- 
self or herself in water. Maybe 
that’s one reason we smell. Another 
reason we don’t do it is we’d never 
come out. It’s all very well for Ter- 
rans — they float. 

How we came to learn to swim 
was, Rogan was moaning as usual 
about the heat when we happened 
to see a couple of girls in bathing 
suits. Nobody had told us about 
that. Ped had been too busy other- 
wise to find out about bathing suits 
— and, as I said, he was an old 
man, anyway. 

Naturally, Rogan had to get into 
a suit. Then she found what they 
were for. 

We were horrified. Rationally, 
we knew it was quite likely that 
human bodies would float. Emo- 
tionally, we knew too well that if 
we went into the water, we’d sink 
like stones. 

T> UT Rogan was still hot and the 
water of the lake looked beau- 
tifully cool. She waded in, waving 
good-by. 

Five minutes later, she could 
float. It was amazingly easy. And 



after that we spent a lot of our 
time in the water. 

At the end of a couple of weeks, 
we went back to Levitski’s to see 
what had happened. 

Nothing had happened. 

I couldn’t believe it. He had sold 
a couple of dozen bottles of Drink 
Me, but that was all. And he’d 
only been able to do that because 
he’d been telling everybody with 
obvious sincerity how wonderful 
the stuff was. 

Could it be that everybody who 
had bought the stuff had been 100 
per cent healthy and sane? 

Two days later, however, we 
had the first nibble. Levitski rang 
up to ask for more. Somebody had 
come in and bought his entire 
stock. 

I made more. And more. And 
more. Soon I couldn’t make it fast 
enough. 

It was a shock to learn, however, 
that people were simply buying 
it as an asthma cure. 

We set up a small factory to 
make the stuff — it was simple 
enough, so long as I supervised 
operations. And then orders started 
coming in from all over the place 
— one from as far as Philadelphia, 
nearly a thousand miles away. 

Then one day, when I arrived 
back at our hotel, Rogan was 
looking excited and secretive. 

“There’s a man to see you,” she 
said. “Dr. Byron. Do you think he 
suspects what we are?” 



I N BLACK AND WHITE 



139 



I went in to see him and find 
out. 

T\R. James Byron was a young- 
ish man, very energetic and 
excitable. “Mr. Smith?” he said. 

I admitted it, then also cau- 
tiously admitted that I had de- 
veloped Drink Me. 

Dr. Byron produced two large 
plates which I recognized as chest 
X-rays. “You’re not a doctor?” 

I shook my head. “Just a 
chemist.” 

“Nevertheless, you might find 
these interesting.” The first X-ray 
showed three tubercular cavities. 
In the second, the cavities were 
much less distinct. 

“You see?” said Byron excited- 
ly. “Regeneration. Do you know 
anything about this, Mr. Smith?” 
“Only what you’ve told me,” I 
said. “This is unusual, isn’t it?” 
“There was precisely one week 
between these X-rays,” said Byron. 
“And the only thing I can find to 
account for this astonishing change 
is that my patient took some of 
your product. Against my advice, I 
may say. I repeat, Mr. Smith — 
do you know anything about this?” 
“We never claimed that Drink 
Me was a cure for tuberculosis,” 
I stated. 

He stared at me. “Why not? In 
my experience, drugs of this sort 
are supposed to do anything. I 
sometimes wonder why anybody 
ever dies.” 



Sarcasm. Obviously this was a 
case for Rogan. I brought her in. 

“This is the sales representa- 
tive,” I said. “My wife Rogan.” 
Byron fixed her with his rather 
wild gaze. “Mrs. Smith, what is 
this product for?” 

“Coughs and colds,” said Rogan 
brightly. “It positively won’t make 
hair grow.” 

“Will it cure tuberculosis?” 
“Well,” said Rogan judicially, 
“it won’t do it any harm.” 

“Bronchitis, asthma, silicosis, 
pneumonia?” 

“I can only suggest,” Rogan said, 
“that you try it and see.” 

“I will,” said Byron. 

A ND he did. He was back three 
days later, dazed. “This stuff 
seems to cure any respiratory ail- 
ment. 

“Oh, that’s good,” Rogan said. 
“I was sure it would be good for 
something. My husband’s very 
clever.” 

“I’m beginning to wonder if you 
are, too,” said Byron thoughtfully. 
Curiously enough, now that he had 
found something to excite him, he 
seemed much less excited and 
much more thoughtful. “In fact, 
Mr. and Mrs. Smith, I’m beginning 
to get ideas about you two.” 

We couldn’t help exchanging 
startled glances. 

“I’m just wondering,” said By- 
ron, “when you’re going to stop 
charging a dollar a bottle and start 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



charging, say, fifty dollars.” 

“Oh,” said Rogan, relieved that 
that was all he was wondering. 
“You think we should?” 

Byron stared hard at her. “What 
else won’t this thing do besides 
not making hair grow?” 

“Well,” said Rogan, “we never 
said it would cure cancer.” 

Byron jumped in the air and 
scuttled out. 

“Six weeks was a good guess,” 
I said complacently. 

Once you start a huge ball roll- 
ing, you can’t stop it if you try. As 
it happened, we didn’t want to stop 
it. 

We were gradually becoming 
famous. So was Drink Me. Our pic- 
tures appeared in the papers. We 
were on newsreels. We sold a 
bottle of Drink Me in Washington. 
The President had had a cough. 

Rogan was asked to sponsor a 
brand of stockings. Somebody had 
noticed her legs. 

A famous male film star rang 
us up and asked plaintively if it 
was quite true that Drink Me 
wouldn’t make hair grow. We said 
sorry, yes. 

Rogan was asked to sponsor a 
shampoo. Somebody had noticed 
her hair. 

A Kentucky farmer claimed to 
have got drunk on Drink Me. He 
didn’t sue; he was delighted. We 
couldn’t account for the incident. 
It turned out that his wife had 
put the medicinal brandy in an 



empty Drink Me bottle. 

Rogan was asked to sponsor a 
new girdle. People were noticing 
too damned much about Rogan. 

Indeed, it was high time we dis- 
appeared. 

The next time Dr. Byron called 
to see us, he had a fat German 
doctor with him, a Dr. Hans Aus- 
terlitz. 

“It is not possible,” Austerlitz 
declared, “to cure cancer in a week 
with a drug orally administered.” 

We agreed. 

“Besides,” said Rogan, “it’s 
against the law to claim to be able 
to cure cancer at all. You know 
that, Doctor.” 

“Nevertheless—” began the Herr 
Doktor. 

Rogan stopped him. “Dr. Aus- 
terlitz, we make a cough mixture. 
Please don’t embarrass us.” 

“But—” Austerlitz tried to con- 
tinue. 

“Please,” said Rogan. 

CHE was right; it was embarrass- 
^ ing. 

I’d never forgotten what Ped 
had said about these people. We 
were public benefactors. So long 
as we were careful to stay public 
benefactors, everything we did 
was fine. Everybody loved us, ex- 
cept people who couldn’t get Drink 
’Me. 

There had inevitably been a 
rush of imitators. One of them was 
called Drink This, another Try 



IN BLACK AND WHITE 



141 



Me. They looked and tasted exact- 
ly like our product. 

But they didn’t do anything, of 
course. 

People bought them only when 
supplies of Drink Me failed, which 
was often. We only had one small 
factory trying to supply the whole 
of the United States, and after that 
the rest of the world. We’d been 
careful to ensure that samples 
reached every part of Earth. 

The last time Byron called on 
us, he had a positively glassy look 
in his eye. 

“Another thing you didn’t claim,” 
he said weakly, “was that Drink 
Me would cure insanity.” 

“That’s right,” Rogan assented. 
“We didn’t claim it, I mean.” 

“Well, I’ve tried it,” said Byron. 
“And in all cases there is a distinct 
improvement. Ordinary people 
who take it seem to have their 
minor neuroses cleared up for 
them.” 

He stopped and looked at us 
pleadingly. “What is this stuff?” 

“A cough mixture,” said Rogan 
brightly. 

“I’m beginning to get ideas 
again,” he said. “I tried to dupli- 
cate your product. I couldn’t.” 

“You didn’t do it right,” I said. 

“I wonder. Once people have 
had a thing like this, they’ve got 
to go on having it. You could hold 
the world for ransom, you know 
that?” 

“He wouldn’t do a thing like 



that,” said Rogan, very shocked. 

“I wonder. Can anybody make 
it but you?” 

We saw no reason to tell him. 

Just two days before we were 
due to leave, a very awkward situ- 
ation arose. The President wanted 
to see us. His cough was better. 
Besides, new legislation was to be 
passed to buy up the Drink Me 
formula, plant, equipment and 
process for the benefit of all hu- 
manity. Apparently any time any- 
thing important happens, human 
beings have to pass laws about it. 

We managed to fix an appoint- 
ment for the day after we’d be 
gone. 

Our last morning we spent 
swimming. As we lay in the sun 
afterward, Regan sighed: “I’m go- 
ing to miss this, Jac.” 

“Me too,” I said. I looked at her, 
slim, tanned, provocative in a white 
sharkskin two-piece. “There’s a lot 
of things I’m going to miss.” 

“I’m almost sorry about what 
we’re doing to them,” she said. 

“Only almost?” 

“Yes, only almost. It’s a good 
idea for a sales team to be two 
people in love with each other. If 
I’d been single, I’d have fallen in 
love with some human male and 
would probably have stayed here. 
And if you’d been single—” 

“I never saw a girl half as pretty 
as you.” 

“You didn’t look,” she said com- 
placently, flexing sundry muscles 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and making my hair stand on end. 

Soon we had to go. We had 
left everything; the people at the 
factory, the reporters, Byron and 
the others could have no clue that 
we’d been planning to disappear. 
All we had with us as we walked 
out that same road were the shoes, 
shirt and pants I wore, and the 
shoes, shorts and blouse Rogan 
wore. 

We were picked up without a 
bit of trouble by Ped. 

V7" ES, we did miss Earth. I didn’t 
know how much until we were 
back in our own bodies and I 
found that even my Vigintan mind 
remembered Rogan wistfully as a 
human female. 

I saw to my disgust that, while 
we’d been gone, Ped had been per- 
fecting a form of zip-fastener which 
he obviously intended to sell on 
the Twenty Worlds. There was 
nothing we could do about it; 
he was first. 

I took my revenge by beating 
him at checkers. On Earth, I’d 
played quite a few games. 

“Well,” he said, “have you mur- 
dered them?” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“Wrecked the place, so that we 
can move in? Given them some- 
thing they can use to kill them- 
selves with? Or what?” 

“You know the law,” I said. 

Ped spat. 

“He’s ill,” said Rogan solicitous- 
I N BLACK AND WHITE 



ly. “Let’s put him to tank, Jac.” 

“I’m not ill,” Ped retorted, sur- 
prised. 

“You must be. You’re spitting. 
You take his leg, Jac, and I’ll 
take his heads.” 

I should have thought of that. 
I only saw Ped spit once more 
after that 

“What did you do to them?” 
he demanded. “You couldn’t sell 
them ergeron, so what did you 
do?” 

We saw we’d have to tell him. 

“We made an investment,” I 
said. 

“We cured them,” said Rogan. 

“You did what?” 

“Cured them. Left them a drug 
which mops up practically all their 
diseases. Lung infections, malig- 
nant growths, most heart diseases, 
paralysis, brain disorders.” 

“And just what do you hope to 
gain by that?” 

I sighed. “Well, with the drop in 
neurosis, they don’t fight wars. 
Won’t be able to now. The stuff 
also makes both sexes universally 
fertile. All the killing diseases and 
war are out, so they’ll breed like 
flies.” 

“So?” 

I sneered. “I thought you could 
play checkers. A few years and 
their world’s full. Before that, 
they’ve gone to the Moon. They 
find how to make homes on Mars 
and Venus, because they have to. 
Then on Mercury, the asteroids 

143 



and Jupiter’s moons, because they 
have to. Then Saturn, Uranus, 
Neptune, Pluto — even Jupiter, 
because they have to.” 

Ped grunted. “Then they buy 
ergeron, because they have to. I 
might have known. Did know. And 
I bet it’ll cost them plenty.” 
“Naturally. And it won’t be so 
very long either.” 

“Poor little Earthmen. They 



should have shot you both.” 

“I’ve got an idea,” Rogan re- 
marked, “that they’re erecting 
statues of us right now. They’re 
nice people.” 

“Who see things in black and 
white,” I supplemented. “And if 
anyone was ever white as snow, 
we are.” 

Ped spat.

Ah, one may well say, there is indeed good news next month: two 
established favorites return like brighter-than-ever comets, and an unfamiliar 
name blazes forth for the first time on the sky map of science fiction luminaries 
— unfamiliar now, but not for long. 

LASTBORN, an Isaac Asimov novella, fresh and resourceful in ideas, 
taut in suspense, wonderfully warm and tender: Scientific experiment or not, 
the. patient is the nurse's responsibility . and all the more so for having 
died endless centuries ago! 

THING OF BEAUTY, a Damon Knight novelet, shrewd and sharp and 
laden with all the good things of Earth: Here is the gizmo that can put Gordon 
Fish in the chips — or land him right in the soup — and he can't possibly 
know which he is ordering! 

FROM AN UNSEEN CENSOR, a sparkling novelet, introduces Rosel 
George Brown, the new name that should soon be as familiar as any in the 
field; a Southern gentlewoman, Mrs. Brown has a muscular inventiveness and 
a hearty, ingenious humor, as for example: You can't beat Uncle Isadore — 
he's quick and he's dead — but that is exactly what he is daring his bewil- 
dered nephew to do! 

Short stories, features, including return of editorials — plus THE LAST 
OF THE MOAS by Willy Ley, a bird much stranger even than its almost unbe- 
lievable appearance would suggest, victim of a tragedy that should never 
have happened, bone (literally) of contention between scientific factions that 
recent developments are forcing into the same encampment — and least 
likely suspect of a discovery that may yet be made.
