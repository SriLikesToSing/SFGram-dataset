how could I resist 



FRED SABERHAGEN 



The battle was a long one for 
deep space, lasting well over a 
standard hour, and as fierce as 
any fight in which the losing side 
can have no expectation of survi- 
val. Commander Ridolfi had 
fought his heavy cruiser, the 
Dipavamsa, with a desperate skill 
that twice in a matter of minutes 
forestalled instant destruction by 
the berserker’s missiles, and each 
member of his crew performed 
superbly well in making such 
combat decisions as could be 
handled slowly enough to let 
human brains co-operate with 
their slave computers. 

The human crew of course 
faced death or worse if they 
should lose. And the berserker, 
their unliving foe, faced its own 
analogue of death and worse- 
than-death. To lose would mean 
destruction — which was nothing 
to a berserker if destruction could 
bring victory. But destruction in 
defeat meant certain failure to 
achieve any further progress to- 
ward its programmed goal, the 
annihilation of all life, whenever 
and wherever it could be at- 
tacked. 

Aboard the Dipavamsa there 
were only four civilian passengers, 
including Otto Novotny, who in 
his long life had never come close 
to taking part in a battle before 
and who felt a great deal too old 
and paunchy for such endeavors 
now. Nevertheless he was more 
alert than any of the other 



civilians, and had begun to don 
his requisite suit of space armor 
as soon as the Battle Stations 
klaxon sounded, while the other 
three were still wondering aloud 
if it was only practice. 

Ten seconds later the first ber- 
serker missile blew against the 
cruiser’s defensive screens, a 
mere kilometer from her hull, and 
they all knew better. 

Dipavamsa was fighting for 
her life several light years from 
any star, along a trade route 
where in these last few standard 
months no unarmed vessels had 
dared to try to pass. The ber- 
serker machine, a sphere some forty 
or fifty kilometers in diameter, all 
armor and combat computers and 
heavy weapons and drive, had 
waited like a spider in the midst 
of the net of detectors it had 
planted in subspace. The region 
where its detectors existed was 
conterminous to one in normal 
space where a strait of hard vac- 
uum bent between two "nebulae, 
forming a bottleneck only a few 
billion kilometers wide in which a 
reasonably fast passage could be 
achieved. When a manned ship 
dared to try the strait — heavy 
cruiser or not — the berserker 
jumped to the attack. 

Locked together with their ar- 
maments of fields and counter- 
fields like grappling ocean ships of 
old, the contending metallic 
giants rolled into normal space.

there to remain until the issue 
was decided. After the first 
enemy missile-blast reverberated 
through the cruiser’s hull, 
Novotny thought that the battle 
would probably be over one way 
or the other before he could get 
himself completely into the un- 
familiar armor. His efforts were 
complicated by a sudden lack of 
artificial gravity; every erg of the 
cruiser’s energies was suddenly 
needed for more important things 
than maintaining a rightsideup. 

But he persevered, working 
with the same methodical speed 
with which he usually solved 
problems of quite a different kind 
and finally got the armor on. No 
sooner had he sealed its last seam 
and begun to wonder what to do 
next, when Dipavamsa’s hull was 
breached by blast and beam. 
Hatches slammed to seal com- 
partments, but the air in their 
compartment could not be held 
and Novotny saw the lives of his 
companions who had ' been too 
slow snuffed out like candle 
flames. 

After that the battle became a 
scrambling confusion of largely 
physical effort for the humans 
who took part in it. For Novotny 
especially, who had less idea of 
what to expect than did any of the 
cruiser’s crew and who was not in 
as good shape as they were 
either. Now the berserker chose 
to hurl some of its auxiliary 
machines across the narrow 



no-man’s-land of space to try to 
board the cruiser. It could use the 
ship if it could capture it still 
reasonably intact, and probably it 
wanted living prisoners. 

Prisoners of course were useful 
for interrogation, after which a 
berserker generally killed them 
quickly; it was programmed only 
to pursue death, not suffering, 
though of course it was quite will- 
ing to apply judicious torture to 
extract information of value in ad- 
vancing the cause of death. And 
prisoners were needed for exper- 
iments that the berserkers carried 
on extensively, in an effort to 
learn what made Homo Sapiens, a 
species now spread across this 
part of the Galaxy, such a resis- 
tant life-form to their relentless 
program of sterilization. 

The berserkers were automated 
warships, made by an unknown 
race to fight in an interstellar war 
that had been over ages since; 
they had outlasted their original 
enemies and their makers as well, 
having been programmed and 
equipped to rebuild and repro- 
duce themselves. Still trying to 
carry out their originally pro- 
grammed task, they had made an 
age-long progress across the spiral 
arms, leaving nothing living in 
their wake. 

While following the motions of 
the Commander’s arms, which 
were gesturing to shovel suited 
people from one wrecked-looking 



6 



GALAXY 




compartment to another, Novotny 
had a chance to look out through 
the holed hull to catch his first 
glimpse of the enemy. The mon- 
strous spherical hull of the ber- 
serker was visible by the cherry- 
glow of craters that the cruiser’s 
weapons had pocked across its 
armor hide. One crater flared 
anew while Novotny watched, 
flamed with some power that 
seemed to be eating like a cancer 
into the enemy’s metal bowels. 
But again the cruiser was rocked 
and shaken in its turn, Novotny 
and Commander Ridolfi were 
picked up by the same invisible 
hand and slammed together into a 
bulkhead, saved only by their 
suits from broken bones. 

Now some of the berserker’s 
boarding machines, which were a 
little bigger than men and of di- 
vers shapes, managed to get 
aboard Dipavamsa, and Novotny 
had a chance to see the enemy at 
close range. Men, some of whom 
were hardened veterans, were 
screaming around him in terror, 
but his own unconsciously- 
maintained attitude was that 
under conditions like these one 
could hardly spare the time to be 
frightened. Vaguely he thought of 
this situation as resembling an 
impossible editorial deadline — one 
thing that could never help was 
panic. He followed as best he 
could the Commander’s waved 
and shouted orders, and kept 
alert. At last he got his own 



chance to blaze away at the foe, 
with a small recoilless rifle he had 
snatched up from a fallen 
crewman’s hands. 

By that time — as Novotny con- 
fusedly understood, from scraps of 
combat jargon that came into his 
helmet — Commander Ridolfi had 
ordered his Second Officer and a 
picked crew to leave the cruiser 
in an armed launch that could 
take shelter among the drifts and 
waves of nebular material in space 
nearby, darting through where 
the bulky berserker could not 
pass at speed. It was a feigned 
acknowledgement of defeat, in- 
tended to make the enemy think 
they were abandoning ship, a bat- 
tle tactic to lure the damaged 
enemy in where a sharp coun- 
terattack might still destroy it. 

Ridolfi himself, as the cruiser’s 
commanding officer, and 
Novotny, as more or less useless 
baggage, were among those who 
stayed aboard her and tried to 
fight a delaying action through 
her corridors. The vacuum around 
Novotny’s helmet continued to 
buzz and sing with the strange 
energies of this battle; he 
clutched his recoilless rifle and 
continued to fire it toward the 
enemy’s boarding machines 
whenever he caught a glimpse of 
one of them. He could not have 
said whether or not his shots were 
doing any good. He also tried to 
stay close to Ridolfi’s side; 
whether he felt in slightly less

hopeless danger there, or was 
hoping thus to improve his 
chances of being useful, he did 
not pause to consider. Ridolfi in- 
deed kept snapping orders, but 
they were meant for members of 
his crew. 

The two of them were still to- 
gether, trying to defend the cen- 
tral control room of the ship, 
when Death struck closer to them 
than an any moment yet. 

It came very suddenly. One 
moment Novotny was still looking 
toward Ridolfi for a hint of what 
they might try to do next — and the 
next moment a berserker machine 
that looked like a cross between a 
centipede and a crab had thrown 
itself upon them and they were 
prisoners. Steel claws that moved 
with the force of atomic power ef- 
fortlessly tore Novotny’s rocket 
launcher away and wrenched the 
Commander’s sidearm from his 
hand. The berserker shifted its 
grip then, holding each pair of 
human arms helpless with a single 
claw — and then machine and men 
went down together in a tangle as 
a new force slammed at the 
cruiser from outside. The Second 
Officer and his picked crew, in 
their fresh and undamaged 
launch, had begun their coun- 
terattack. 

The crab-centipede was 
wrecked, sheared almost in two, 
as the launch sent something like 
the Angel of the Lord passing al- 
most invisibly through the embat- 



tled ship, cutting selectively, pass- 
ing over fragile human bodies 
and machinery that it could 
somehow identify as human prop- 
erty. 

The mass of his late captor, and 
its tenacious grip which had not 
relaxed with the destruction of its 
computer-brain, pinned Novotny 
in an angle between deck and 
bulkhead, surrounded by wreck- 
age. Beside him Ridolfi grunted 
and struggled in similar difficul- 
ties. Then they abruptly ceased 
their efforts to get free, simul- 
taneously ceased even to 
breathe — another berserker 
machine was entering the dam- 
aged control room. 

If it was aware of them, it did 
not turn. It moved straight to one 
of the panels before which a 
human astrogator normally sat, 
and with a startling delicacy 
began to remove the panel from 
its mounting. Neatly — almost 
timidly, it seemed — it probed for 
the panel fasteners, teasing and 
tickling at them with grasping de- 
vices that could have ripped the 
panel free like so much tissue 
paper. 

... it was working so carefully, 
and now it almost had what it was 
after. It reached inside and pulled 
out . very slowly . 

... a small metal case . 

That burst into a flaming snow- 
ball even as the berserker oh so 
gently tugged it free of its connec- 
tions, a blaze that here in free fall 



8 



GALAXY 




sent out its flames in a sunburst of 
straight radii, a wad of radiant 
glory that the enemy instantly 
hurled away. Without pause the 
enemy turned to snatch up a 
small bundle of paper printout 
that writhed weightlessly across 
the deck. It shoved this inside it- 
self, door slamming shut protec- 
tively across the orifice — and the 
machine was gone, lunging with 
inhuman speed out of the room 
again. 

“Novotny.” The two of them 
gasped for breath again and once 
more struggled against the dead 
claws that held them prisoner. 
“Look — can you shift your weight 
this way? Lean on it here, maybe 
I can get a hand out of this 
claw. .” 

After a minute or two of 
cooperative effort both of them 
were free. From some compara- 
tively great distance the shocks 
and slams of battle were still com- 
ing to them through the hull. 
“Novotny, listen to me.” The 
Commander talked while looking 
for his pistol, which he at last 
grabbed from a turning swirl of 
other weightless debris that 
drifted in the middle of the room. 
“It was going after our astroga- 
tional databank just then. After 
that thing that burst into flame?” 

“I saw.” 

“It didn’t get what it wanted, 
because the bank’s destructor 
charge worked when it was pulled 
out. But it must need astroga- 



tional information badly, or it 
wouldn’t have sent a machine 
after it, before the battle’s even 
over. Maybe its own banks have 
been shot up.” 

Novotny moved his head inside 
his helmet, showing that he un- 
derstood so far. 

The Commander had his pistol 
back, held absently in his right 
hand, and his left hand clamped 
briefly on Novotny’s suited arm. 

“I believe you have in your quar- 
ters something it could use as a 
substitute. I understand you’re 
traveling with the whole new edi- 
tion of Encyclopedia Calactica in 
microstorage — and the EG gives 
galactic coordinates for all inha- 
bited systems, right?” 

Novotny agreed again. Now 
that he had been almost immobile 
for a little while, his muscles were 
starting to stiffen from the unac- 
customed workout. He could hear 
the wheezings from inside his 
own chest, and his body was be- 
ginning to feel like so much fluid 
lead. If they weren’t in free fall 
he would certainly be dizzy and 
have to sit down. Decades at a 
senior executive’s desk had left 
him too fat and old for this kind of 
nonsense. 

But he was moving again now, 
keeping up with the agile Com- 
mander as they picked their way 
out of the ruined control room, 
which now looked not in fit shape 
for controlling anything. 

“Then we’ve got to get to your 



THE ANNIHILATION OF ANGKOR APEIRON 



9 




quarters,” the Commander was 
saying, “while there’s still a 
chance. You’ve got just the one 
copy of the encyclopedia there?” 

“Yes.” 

“We must see that it’s de- 
stroyed.” 

They had started down a cor- 
ridor, and there came a glimpse 
of a machine moving ahead of 
them, and the vibrations of its 
massy passage came through the 
bulkheads to their gripping hands. 
Taking shelter together in a 
doorway, they waited for it to get 
out of their way. 

The Commander kept trying to 
make contact with his Second Of- 
ficer by suit radio, but seemed 
unable to get any reply. Maybe, 
thought Novotny, it’s only that 
the space between is far too 
noisy. 

“Commander,” he asked, when 
there was a momentary opportun- 
ity, “What sector are we in now? 
Of the Galaxy, I mean, in Revised 
Galactic Coordinates?” 

Ridolfi’s eyes came to full focus 
on him for what might have been 
the first time. “Omicron Sector, 
Ring Eleven — what does it mat- 
ter? Oh, you mean you want to 
know which volumes of your set it 
will be most important to destroy. 
Good thinking. That damned 
machine will be too shot up itself 
to get out of Omicron without 
help. I don’t think it’ll be able to 
catch another ship, even if one 
should come along. It’ll be trying 



to find an undefended planet 
nearby, within a light year or two 
if possible, preferably an inha- 
bited one where there’ll be 
machines it can take over and 
some readymade materials that it 
can use to repair itself.” 

“And my encyclopedia is now 
the only means by which it can 
locate such a planet?” 

“That’s the way I read the situ- 
ation. It can’t just go visiting stars 
at random, the chance of success 
is far too small . remember 
that printout it picked up from 
the control room floor? That was a 
copy of what we call the Military 
Information Sheet, which we got 
when we filed our flight plan. 
Among other things it contains a 
list of all the defended planets 
along our projected course — all 
the places where we might be 
able to look for help in case of an 
emergency. I suppose it’ll go for 
one of them if it can’t find any- 
thing better. But in your refer- 
ence book it’s likely to get the 
address of some undefended 
one . the war’s a recent thing 
in this neck of the galactic woods, 
remember?” 

Novotny’s face bore a doubtful 
look, but the Commander was no 
longer watching him. 

“Coast’s clear, Novotny. Let’s 
move.” Then the two of them 
were in motion again, diving and 
scrambling in free fall. For the 
moment their luck held; no more 
berserkers came in sight as they 



10 



GALAXY 




reached the stateroom corridor 
and swam along it to the door of 
Novotny’s cabin. The door had 
been jammed shut by some warp- 
ing of the battered ship around it, 
and it took the men an agonizing 
moment or two to force it free. 

Then they were inside. “Where 
is it?” 

“There on the table, Command- 
er. Already plugged into the 
reading machine. But wait.” A 
new anxiety had come into 
Novotny’s voice. “I’m not sure 
that destruction is our wisest 
move.” 

Commander Ridolfi only looked 
at him. “Get back.” 

But Novotny had not moved 
when a third figure suddenly 
joined them in the little cabin; 
the crab-centipede’s cousin, which 
raised a multitude of claws. 

The Commander aimed his gun 
again, but not at the berserker. 
He thought his own life and battle 
now lost anyway, and more im- 
portant than perhaps damaging 
one more of the berserker’s 
machines would be denying it this 
information on new targets. He 
aimed at the reading machine that 
sat like some dull sculpture on 
the table. 

Novotny reached out deliber- 
ately and knocked Ridolfi’s arm 
aside: 

The berserker, on the verge of 
killing both of them, hesitated 
fractionally as it observed their 
struggle. Did one of these life- 



units wish to become goodlife, a 
willing ally of the cause of Death? 
Such conversions had happened 
before, more than a few times, 
and a goodlife could be very use- 
ful. And what on the table was so 
important that a life-unit strug- 
gled to destroy it — ? 

From the armed launch came 
the next phase of counterattack. 
The cabin was nearly ripped 
apart. The berserker lashed out at 
Ridolfi, and the Commander saw 
that his pistol was gone again, be- 
fore it could be fired, and his arm 
gone with it almost to the shoul- 
der. The suit will seal itself 
around the wound, he thought, in 
sudden massive shock that made 
all things seem trivial. He saw the 
reading machine snatched up 
from the table in the claws of the 
berserker, and the launch’s 
weapons struck again. A fresh 
gust of escaping atmosphere 
whirled through the cruiser from 
a newly-ruptured compartment, 
and with the last glow of his con- 
sciousness the Commander could 
see stars. 

His first feeling when his 
wits came back was sheer as- 
tonishment at being still alive. As- 
tonishment deepened when he 
realized that he had somehow 
been brought on board the ar- 
mored launch. All four bunks in 
its tiny sickbay were full of 
wounded, and men and women 
and machines were steadily at 



THE ANNIHILATION OF ANGKOR APEIRON 



11 




work, passing back and forth con- 
tinually in the small space be- 
tween the bunks. 

The Second Officer came in to 
report, relief dawning on his face 
when he saw that Ridolfi was get- 
ting up and evidently in shape to 
resume his command. Shock and 
loss of blood had been treated, 
pain blocked, and bandages sealed 
the wound from which a new arm 
could one day be made to grow. 

The Second made his report 
concisely. The launch was now 
some half a million kilometers 
within the nebula, its defenses 
alertly repelling or safely 
detonating — so far — all the tor- 
pedoes that the berserker had 
sent after it. The battle had 
ground to a halt, otherwise, in 
mutual though incomplete de- 
struction. What was left of the 
cruiser had now been abandoned 
by both contending forces. Before 
pulling back deep within the 
nebula, the launch had dared to 
delay long enough to follow dis- 
tress signals and pick up two 
suited survivors who had, it 
seemed, somehow been blown 
clean away from the embattled 
cruiser in the last stages of the 
fighting. One of the survivors was 
Commander Ridolfi himself. The 
other. 

“That makes nineteen people 
on the air and food,” the Second 
Officer mused, as they stood look- 
ing down at the collapsed shape of 
Otto Novotny, slumped in total 



exhaustion in a corner of the small 
dayroom where there hardly 
seemed room for his gross form. 
“Still, we should be able to recy- 
cle, and make supplies last until 
we’re eventually picked up. .” 

“I don’t know if there’ll be 
nineteen or not, for very long.” 
Ridolfi’s voice was hard as that of 
one just going into battle, not 
coming out of it, and his eyes 
were welded on the fat civilian. 

“Sir?” The Second didn’t get it 
at all, not yet. 

“I mean, Mister, that unless I 
get some questions answered by 
this man here, and answered 
damn fast. I’m going to convene a 
formal court and press charges 
against him of voluntarily aiding a 
berserker. ” 

There were only six people in 
the dayroom when the first inform- 
al inquiry began; the Command- 
er didn’t want to prejudice pos- 
sible jurors if the thing came to a 
formal trial, which he was em- 
powered to give even civilians 
when in space and in the face of 
the enemy. 

As Novotny, by now somewhat 
recovered though still slow of 
movement and blinking a bit be- 
wilderedly, was ushered in and 
shown to the seat across the table 
from him, the Commander was 
simultaneously handed a note 
from the other side. It informed 
him that the berserker had just 
been observed dropping out of 



12 



GALAXY 







normal space in the area of the 
battle. Instruments showed it de- 
parting the local area, having evi- 
dently completed such emergency 
repairs as it could manage on the 
spot. A reading on the subspace 
signals of its departure gave a vec- 
tor for its probable destination 
that deepened the lines carved 
down through Ridolfi’s cheeks. 

A silence grew in the room, 
until Ridolfi spoke. “This is not 
yet a trial, Mr. Novotny. But I 
warn you that there may be one 
before we get back to a planet, if 
we ever do; or are picked up by 
another human ship, if we ever 
are. If there is a trial, you will be 
charged with voluntarily aiding a 
berserker, and conviction will 
carry an almost certain penalty of 
death.” 

Exhaustion and puzzlement 
seemed to be absorbed almost at 
once within the layers of fat as 
Novotny pulled himself together. 
“Ah. I stand ready, of course. 
Commander, to answer any ques- 
tions on my behavior that you 
may have.” 

“That’s good. Frank answers 
will be required.” Ridolfi tried to 
keep his one hand from fidgetting 
before him on the table. “On 
board the cruiser, in a combat 
situation, you deliberately inter- 
fered with my attempt to destroy 
(he databank containing your en- 
cyclopedia. Do you deny it?” 

Novotny was sitting very still, 
as if he feared that movement

might land him in further trouble 
of some kind. He thought before 
answering, and his face main- 
tained a frown. ‘No, I do not deny 
that, Commander.” 

The Commander paused, then 
put his arm out on the table, fin- 
gers opened, elbow straight, a 
dominating gesture. “You do not. 
Very well. My intention in de- 
stroying that data, sir, was to pre- 
vent its use as an astrogational aid 
by the berserker. If you wanted 
to save it, it was surely not for 
yourself. Did you expect that the 
berserker might accord you some 
favorable treatment if you. .” 
Novotny was shaking his head. 
“I very seriously doubt that the 
data in the encyclopedia will do 
the enemy the least bit of good, 
in this case. Nor did I wish to 
help the enemy.” 

The Commander’s voice was re- 
lentlessly unchanged. “On the 
cruiser, you and I both saw the 
berserker going after the astroga- 
tional databank, which it evi- 
dently needed but didn’t get. 

“We also know the enemy is 
severely damaged, which means it 
will be looking for some compara- 
tively near planet where it can 
commandeer machinery and ma- 
terials to repair itself; in addition, 
of course, to wiping out as many 
unprotected human lives there as 
it can reach. Because we fought it 
to a standstill here in space 
doesn’t mean it won’t be able to 
poison an atmosphere and de- 



populate a planet, if it comes on 
one only lightly defended or takes 
one unaware. Is all this news to 
you?” 

“I think I understand all this, 
Commander.” 

“Let those who are here with 
us be witness that you do.” 
Ridolfi glanced briefly round at 
the faces of the others, all of them 
staring now at the accused. “Be- 
cause so far you are answering 
yourself right into a trial. Mister 
Novotny. There are only two 
things, basically, that a berserker 
ever wants or needs; victims, and 
facilities for repair and refitting. 
And you’ve shown this one where 
to go for both of them.” 

Novotny slumped a little in his 
chair and closed his eyes. But 
when he opened them his voice 
was as steady as before. “Com- 
mander, if I am. indeed on trial 
for my life, or likely to be, then I 
would like to hear the charges 
and the evidence as fully as possi- 
ble before I try to answer them. 
Go on.” 

“Very well.” Ridolfi nodded 
grimly. “You came on board the 
Dipavamsa with two copies of your 
new edition, one of which was 
subsequently and routinely 
stowed aboard this launch, along 
with some other baggage not im- 
mediately in use. That copy is still 
here and available, and since 
going off combat alert I’ve fed it 
into our computer and asked for a 
readout — as the berserker can 



14 



GALAXY 




readily do with the copy you gave 
it — of all inhabited planets within 
seven light-years of where our 
battle was fought. That’s about as 
far as that berserker is going to 
get without repairs; and extending 
the radius another light year or so 
brings no new planets in.” 

The Commander had a paper 
which he now consulted. “There 
are seven inhabited planets to be 
found, according to the Ency- 
clopedia Galactica, within that 
radius. They are Angkor Apeiron, 
Comparettia, Epirus, Francavilla, 
Han Kao, Reissner, and Yang 
Ch’i. Exact coordinates, RGC, are 
given for each.” He put one piece 
of paper on the table and took 
another from a pocket of his shirt. 
“I have here part of a spare copy 
of the Military Information Sheet 
given us when we filed our flight 
plan before departing on this trip. 
Among other things, it lists the 
six inhabited planets in this same 
region that have notable ground 
defenses, or fleet units standing 
by, or both. As one more bit of 
evidence, Mr. Novotny, let me 
state now that you were also a 
witness with me that a copy of 
this list of the six defended 
planets was also seized by the 
berserker. Any denials yet?” 
Ridolfi’s fingers were shaking and 
he put the second paper down. 
“Not yet, Commander.” 
“Though whether you under- 
stood the full implications of that 
seizure at the time. .” 



“I had . some idea, I sup- 
pose, of what the implications 
were. Proceed.” 

Ridolfi read: “The six defended 
planets on the military list for this 
region are: Comparettia, Epirus, 
Francavilla, Han Kao, Reissner, 
and Yang Ch’i. Notably missing 
from this military list is Angkor 
Apeiron.” The Commander 
pushed his second paper out on 
the table beside the first, where 
anyone who wished might look 
them over, and then produced a 
third. 

He went on: “According to the 
latest census figures, as given in 
this EG article, this world has 
about eleven million, six hundred 
thousand inhabitants. Its chief ex- 
port industries are crystal growing 
and natural honey. The spaceport 
is small, but probably the ber- 
serker could plunder it. for useful 
machines and materials after it 
has wiped out what appears to be 
an undefended populace. 

The Commander needed a 
moment before he could con- 
tinue. “Angkor Apeiron was dis- 
covered by Chang Izanagi, of 
Hathor, in 7626 CE . first col- 
onized only ten standard years 
later.” His voice was starting to 
shake a little like his hand. “I 
suppose your reference work is 
quite reliable in these particulars? 
I mean, about there being eleven 
million people there, especially?” 

Novotny paused for thought, 
began to speak, then stopped and 



THE ANNIHILATION OF ANGKOR APEIRON 



15 




shook his head and tried again. 
“The EG is the most reliable gen- 
eral reference work in human his- 
tory, Your Honor — Command- 
er — whatever I am to call you 
now — ” 

“ ‘Commander’ will still do.” 

“ — when it is used for the pur- 
poses for which it is intended. 
Which is to say that it was never 
meant to serve as a manual of do- 
it-yourself medicine, or law, or as- 
trogation either. It is a means by 
which one can verify, or learn, a 
fact; check a date or name; obtain 
entree to almost any field of 
knowledge, and learn where to go 
for further. .” 

“Yes. Spare us the sales talk, 
we’re not in the market for a set 
right now.” Nobody cracked a 
smile. “Now here in your reliable 
reference work, which you gave 
the enemy as a present, are the 
precise coordinates for the 
Apeiron system; Sector Omicron 
111.254, Ring Eleven 87.58, 
Galactic Latitude 7.54 North. 
These figures are correct, are they 
not? Hasn’t the EG a competent 
editorial staff, with the technical 
and scientific knowledge. .” 

“The staff at the home office is 
more than competent. Command- 
er. It is very good indeed. I 
speak from personal experience.” 

The Commander leaned for- 
ward. “Then what, Mr. Novotny, 
is going to save the inhabitants of 
Angkor Apeiron from the conse- 
quences of your action?” 



Novotny leaned back, some- 
what haughtily, as if he had at last 
taken affront. “Only the fact. 
Commander, that the inhabitants 
of Angkor Apeiron do not exist.” 
There was a silence in the day- 
room, as if each person who 
looked at the speaker were wait- 
ing for his last words to somehow 
clear themselves out of the air, or 
for some great hand to reach in 
from outside the little ship and 
mend the broken spring of sanity. 

The Commander, his shakiness 
shocked away, was the first to 
reply: “You mean . you claim 
to have some knowledge . that 
the planet has already been 
evacuated, or wiped out?” 

“I mean, sir, that the star 
Apeiron has no planets. It has 
never had any. When the ber- 
serker arrives there it will find no 
victims and no material help; and 
if your estimate of its damaged 
condition is as accurate as I would 
like to believe, before it can go on 
to some other world it will have 
died, if that is the proper word, of 
the injuries your crew has so gal- 
lantly inflicted on it.” 

“But . .” The Second Officer 
was starting a disbelieving pro- 
test. 

Novotny rounded on him 
sharply. “Why do you suppose 
the military authorities protected 
six settled planets in this region 
and ignored a seventh?” 

“Lack sufficient forces. .” 
“Bah. Correct me if I am 



16 



GALAXY 




wrong, Commander, but would 
not the general or admiral in 
charge be more likely to spread 
his forces thinner, and not leave 
eleven million people totally un- 
defended, since this sector has 
become a combat zone? Of course 
his forces are probably spread all 
too thin already, which is why I 
thought it good to direct our late 
antagonist to a desert system, 
rather than letting it go challenge 
some of them. ” 

Ridolfi had recovered, or al- 
most. “Desert system? But this 
EG entry . you claim your en- 
cyclopedia is the most 
reliable. .” 

Novotny was holding up a 
pudgy, magisterial hand, and his 
face had eased into something 
that approached a smile. “I will 
explain, as I have promised. But 
to do so I must briefly go far 
afield from berserkers and space 
warfare.” 

His accuser had not yet relaxed 
a bit. “Do so. Go as far as you 
like. But be sure that you come 
back.” 

Novotny took another moment 
to marshall his thoughts before he 
spoke. “Suppose . suppose that 
you, Commander, are a ruthlessly 
good businessman, back on Earth 
or one of the other crowded 
worlds. And you decide that there 
is money to be made in purveying 
information to the public, even as 
EG makes money. You decide 
that you will compile and sell a 



general reference work. Or 
perhaps one more specialized — on 
ga lac to graph y, let us say, listing 
and describing all the inhabited 
and explored planets as well as 
other bodies in the Galaxy that 
are for some reason interesting. 

“You decide that you will put a 
great deal less work into your en- 
cyclopedia than we put into ours, 
and therefore be able to sell yours 
for a great deal less money, while 
including the same information 
we include. How? The most di- 
rect expedient is of course to copy 
all your articles verbatim from 
ours; but this the laws and courts, 
alas for your enterprise, are never 
going to allow. You are forced to 
the inconvenience of at least re- 
writing our material somewhat as 
you crib. 

“Given a little computer help, 
to rearrange the syntax and re- 
place words with their synonyms, 
this will not be such an arduous 
task as might at first appear. Even 
our several billions of words 
might be rehashed and reprinted, 
in slightly different format, in 
a quite reasonable time. Behold! 
And Commander Ridolfi’s Ency- 
clopedia of All Knowledge is avail- 
able for the home data bank, at a 
much lower fee than ours 
. never mind that you will not 
provide your customers with the 
constant updating service that ours 
receive. 

“So! Even with much rewriting, 
your basic idea is still illegal, 



THE ANNIHILATION OF ANGKOR APEIRON 



17 




still infringes upon our copy- 
rights, does it not? Well,, now 
the answer is no longer quite so 
clear-cut. But believe me, our 
lawyers will try, have tried in 
similar cases, to sue you for a 
bundle, as soon as they find out 
what you have done. 

“Now you show up for trial, 
and are on the witness stand, 
though not with your life at stake 
of course . Commander 
Ridolfi, I the prosecuting attorney 
ask you: Is it true or not, that you 
have compiled your so-called re- 
ference work virtually entirely 
from EG? Now think carefully, for 
on your answer your whole de- 
fense will stand or fall. 

“Of course it is not true! you 
answer ringingly. You used the 
Merchant Astrogation banks, you 
used periodicals and the records 
from dusty archives, you looked 
in books, you queried eminent 
authorities in many fields, just as 
does the great EG itself. 

“Ohh? I ask, and now my voice 
is of the softest, and I cast an eye 
toward the jury. Then tell me, 
sir, which of these many indis- 
pensable sources did you use to 
cross-check your information on 
the planet Angkor Apeiron?” 

There was another silence in 
the dayroom, a different sort of 
silence this time, and death that 
had all along seemed close was 
suddenly light years off again, at 
one with the berserker’s wake 
that faded in subspace. 



Novotny felt the difference and 
began to sag. “Because you see, 
sir, we have made this entry up, 
population, industries, discovery 
date and all, as encyclopedists 
have made up entries for the 
same reason from very ancient 
times. We made it up to catch 
such plagiaristic fish as you, and 
put it as bait for you within the 
great EG, and nowhere else in 
the great universe of worlds or in- 
formation storage does Angkor 
Apeiron exist . there are a 
number of other baits like this 
one. Commander, among our 
forty million entries. Quite a few, 
like this , one, I had a hand in 
making up myself; but how many 
there are altogether I do not 
know; no one man or woman 
knows them all. The ordinary' user 
is of course never going to hear of 
Angkor Apeiron anysVhere and is 
therefore never going to look it 
up. If he comes upon it while 
browsing at his reading machine, 
he is only treated to a dull and 
minor fantasy that he will soon 
forget.” 

Novotney let himself sink back 
into a chair that no longer seemed 
to be a dock above the edge of 
death. Then he turned his head to 
a wallscreen showing space, and 
looked off into the nebular cloud- 
banks of the Deep. “I wonder if it 
can even wonder how it was 
tricked, or how it tricked 
itself. .1 know that it could 
never understand.” ★

cleopatra amid the kudzu 

Do you know what kudzu is? 
Kudzu. Most people who live in a 
domed city, even the Urban Nu- 
cleus of Atlanta, aren’t like to 
know. How many of you have 
been outside our huge, geodesic 
walnut? I know about kudzu for 
two reasons: when I was very lit- 
tle my grandmother used to tell 
me about it and, more impres- 
sively maybe, I am one of those 
who have been into the Open: 
Japan invades. 

Far Eastern vines 
Run from the 

clay banks they are 
Supposed to 

keep from eroding, 

Up telephone poles. 

Which rear, 

half out of leafage, 

As though 

they would shriek. 

James Dickey’s description of 
kudzu in the opening lines of a 
poem entitled “Kudzu.” It’s a 
good description, too, especially 
the part, about the telephone 
poles shrieking. Not too many 
standing telephone poles out 
there anymore, but pine trees, 
old barns, collapsing fire 
towers— all of these do seem to 
be shrieking as the merciless 
kudzu clambers over them. 

Kudzu. Pueraria lobata, native 
to Japan, imported during a pre- 
cious century to keep the red clay 
from washing away. Baroque, 
vegetable architecture. 

My grandmother told me about 
it before I ever saw it. My last 



name is Noble, but Zoe, my 
grandmother, gave me my first 
one: Clio. I remember Zoe very 
well even though she lived with 
us only the last three years of her 
life and died when I was five. 
Also, I have a photograph of my 
grandmother that she took her- 
self, using a tripod and timer: a 
large black-and-white one. This 
photograph, which sits on top of 
my visicom console as I write 
this, gives me a hand-hold on 
Zoe’s heart and on several genera- 
tions of the past. 

The past is important to me. 
Just as you have to hack your way 
out of furiously growing kudzu to 
attain a vantage point on the sur- 
rounding terrain, sometimes you 
have to rise above and survey the 
past in order to get the lay of 
your own soul. Zoe understood 
that, and I think that’s why my 
arents, after once renouncing 
er and packing her off to the 
Geriatrics Hostel, let her, in her 
seventy-second year, stick me 
with a monicker like Clio. But, 
having bridged a generation and 
walked over that bridge into my 
grandmother’s life, 1 find that I 
like my name OK. 

In Greek mythology, you know, 
Clio was the Muse of History. (Ta 
da!) 

The piece of history I’m telling 
now occurred just last year, but 
really it takes in many more 
human seasons than just 2066, 
month of Summer. It’s the story 
of how three of us on a 
resources-reclamation team, in 
the employ of the Human De- 
velopment Commission (the very 



21 




same authority that, nineteen 
years ago, disbanded Zoe’s ex- 
perimental septigamoklan in the 
Geriatrics Hostel), went out into 
the Open to fetch back several 
people to our Urban Nucleus. 

Although I was only twenty-one 
last summer. I’d been out on 
three missions before the one this 
story is about: all routine, all pre- 
dictable. We’d “reclaimed ’ a 
number of people with desirable 
technical skills or influential rela- 
tives in the city by going out, 
finding their kudzu-camouflaged 
encampments, and asking them to 
return with us. Upon the promise 
of enfranchisement and respect- 
able jobs, they all had: every one 
of them. They were flattered that 
an rr team had been sent out for 
them. 

Our efforts were part of what 
the bureaucrats in the Commis- 
sion called the “Fifth Evacuation 
Lottery” — although it wasn’t an 
evacuation at all in the way the 
first four had been, when the 
domes were going up sixty and 
seventy years ago (1994-2004, in 
case you’re counting: a neat de- 
cade). The Fifth Evacuation Lot- 
tery is another thing altogether, 
not an evacuation but a series of 
carefully planned manhunts. 

The three of us who went out 
last summer were Newjyn Yates, 
the team leader; Alexander Guest, 
a man of swarthy complexion al- 
though, unlike Yates, not a black; 
and me, Clio Noble. Three was 
the optimum number for such 
teams; it had something to do 
with an old NASA policy. 

Twice before I’d been on teams

with Newlyn Yates, and I was a 
little bit dithery about him: he 
did things to my sense of equilib- 
rium, sabotaged it mostly. But 
Yates was all poker spine, set jaw, 
and unflappable decorum, and 
we’d never come close to body- 
burning, despite the opportunities 
spending all that time in the 
Open naturally provides. Yates 
was awfully interior, he was in- 
grown. In the Open you couldn’t 
get him to uncoil, he did every- 
thing as if by an invisible manual. 
Off duty, you never got a chance 
to see him. 

Alexander Guest, a big, 
mahogany-colored man with a 
graggy profile, was probably ten 
years older than Yates. He looked 
like he ought to be wearing moc- 
casins and the traditional turban 
of the old Creek Indians — for 
good reason, it turned out. Before 
our assignment last summer. I’d 
never met him before, never even 
seen him in the Comihission Au- 
thority tower. He was just insane 
enough to like traipsing through 
kudzu; you could tell by the way 
the wilderness polled up in his 
muddy eyes. He was insane in 
other ways, too. 

But this I found out in the 
Open. On the day I met him in 
the rr section of the Human De- 
velopment Tower, he just looked 
bummish and uncouth. We were 
sitting in plastic chairs in the car- 
peted anteroom of Yates’ office, 
two zombies rising out of the 
deadness of sleep at six o’clock in 
the morning: even so, I had to 
admit that the craggy, brown man 
whose bulk seemed to overflow 
the fragile cup of his chair was 

GALAXY 




more awake than I. 

‘Lo,” he said. An orotund 
rumble. 

I nodded. 

“Looks like we’re gonna be 
team members. You know what 
this one’s about?” 

“No,” I said. “Do you?” 

“Think SO. ” H e said this 
matter-of-factly rather than 
smugly, but I still didn’t feel like 
asking him the natural follow-up 
question. So, shifting in his wob- 
bly chair (with him in it, it looked 
like it had been stolen from a 
Van-Ed elementary division class- 
room), he said, “What’s yOur 
name, Miz?” 

I told him. 

"Cleo,” he said, missing it by a 
letter. “Short for Cleopatra. Mar- 
ried up with her brother and 
bodyburned with two Romans. 
Well, Cleo, you’re the first red- 
haired ‘Gyptian I’ve ever seen. 
Nice to meet you.” 

I didn’t correct him about my 
name. I did manage the bogus 
courtesy of nodding: again. That 
was all I could manage. 

“History’s a pastime of mine,” 
he said after a while. “My name’s 
Guest, Alexander Guest. That’s 
how I’m listed in the UrNu cen- 
sus anyhow, and even here at the 
Tower. Really, though, it’s an 
alias. 

“The alias I’d rather go by,” he 
said after musing for a while, “is 
Menewa. But it’s hard to get peo- 
ple in an Urban Nucleus to call 
you that. All the forms say Last 
name, first name, middle initial.’ 
You write down somepin like 
Menewa’ they jes’ stamp IN- 
COMPLETE on the forms and 



send ’em back to you. You see, 
Cleo, I’m an Indian. The name 
Menewa. ...” 

Fortunately, he got cut off be- 
cause Newlyn Yates, trim in a 
one-piece worksuit and street 
slippers, glided through the an- 
teroom and into his office. Guest 
didn’t have time to lapse into an 
incomprehensible Muskohogean 
dialect: the words “Come in” 
floated back to us as Yates disap- 
peared, and the Indian Menewa 
and the ‘Gvptian Cleopatra ex- 
changed a glance, got up, and fol- 
lowed their black pharoah- 
chieftain into the dark. 

In the center of Yates’ metal 
desk — once Yates had coasted the 
false wood surface aside — you 
could see an illuminated projec- 
tion well; in fact, that was all we 
see when we came into his office. 
Yates was standing behind the 
desk and he beckoned us to take 
up positions opposite him. Then 
he pushed a button so that a map 
of tne transit tunnels leading out 
of Atlanta to the other Urban 
Nuclei appeared in the projection 
well. 

“We’ll take a transit-car to this 
station,” Yates said, pointing at 
the map. “The juncture of the 
Miami and Savannah tunnels, 
southeast of here. Then we ll have 
to go to the end of the Savannah 
tributary, dismantle the filter sys- 
tem on one of the ventilation 
units, climb through, and strike 
out on foot. The biomonitor-relay 
people have one of our targets 
placed at about forty-five kilome- 
ters due east of the tunnel junc- 
ture.” Yates’ father had once been 
the director of the city’s 

23 



ALLEGIANCES 




Biomonitor Agency, but in the 
last fifteen years the Agency had 
extended its operations to include 
surveillance of the natives of the 
countryside; this was in addition 
to the medical monitoring of all 
dome-dwellers. A target, both 
then and now, was a human being 
who was being monitored. 

“Hot damn,” I said. An old ex- 
pression of my grandmother’s. 
“How did they manage that?” 

“An implant tab at the nape of 
our subject’s neck, they told me,” 
Yates said. “A month ago — two 
months ago — he came into the 
city.” 

‘‘Why?” 

“The Agency told me he 
brought a truckload of peanuts up 
here, using what’s left of the old 
highway system. While here, he 
was drugged, implanted, and af- 
terwards pumped by a hypnotist- 
physician at Grady Memorial. 
He’s not aware of the implant tab 
or the fact that he was ques- 
tioned.” 

“Why didn’t we just keep him 
here when he came to the city? It 
doesn’t make sense to go out and 
fetch him now.” I was doing all 
the asking: Alexander Guest, the 
gingerbread Indian, was standing 
hunch-shouldered and open- 
mouthed beside me. 

“The man’s name is Jonah 
Trap,” Yates said, irritated with 
me, the projection well giving his 
face the demonic geometry of a 
mask. “A black. But we’re not 
going after him, Miz Noble. 
We’re after two people whose in- 
telligence and ability the city 
needs and who’re now apparently 
living with Trap near the old town 

24 



of Toombsboro. You were 
selected for this assignemnt be- 
cause one of the people is a 
woman: the Commission Author- 
ity believes you may be able, far 
better than Mr. Guest or I, to 
persuade her to return with us.” 

“Why was I chosen?” Indian 
Alex said, surprising both Yates 
and me. 

“I thought they explained that 
to you. You met Trap while he 
was here, they told me; they said 
you’d even been into that area of 
the Open before. Is that true?” 

“Yep.” 

“Then those are your reasons. 
You ought to be helpful.” Then 
Yates said, “And in case the ques- 
tion seems to logically present it- 
self now, I’m going because I’m 
ood at taking teams out and 
ringing them back entire. The fact 
I’m black probably won’t hurt 
much either, not in this instance.” 

“Well,” I said, “who are the 
people? The man . and the 
woman?” 

“That, Miz Noble, I can’t tell 
you till we’re on our way to 
Toombsboro.” 

“Why not?” 

“If I could tell you that,”I said, 
“I could tell you the other. 
Couldn’t I?” 

“Not necessarily. Maybe the 
Commission Authority just wants 
to be sure we don’t spread our 
targets’ names around before we 
leave. You could easily tell us that 
without telling us the names of 
the targets.” 

“Well, Miz Noble, if you have 
it all figured out, why ask?” Yates 
was an icicle with an iron bar in- 
side it, and I had just put my 

GALAXY 




lily-white foot so far into my 
mouth that I was gnawing on 
ankle bone. Hot damn, I said to 
myself: an old expression of my 
grandmother’s. 

Aloud I said, “I don’t have it all 
figured out. I didn’t even know 
we had a tunnel to Old Savannah: 
Savannah’s not one of the Urban 
Nuclei. Never was, was it?” 

“It’s about one-tenth of a tun- 
nel,” Yates said, letting his finger 
trace the route in the projection 
well. “A dead-ender. Anyway, the 
geology of the coastal region 
wouldn’t permit the construction 
of a viable tunnel, even if there 
were people there to get to. Same 
with Miami. Most of the Trans- 
Seminole ‘tunnel,” you know, is 
above-ground and hooded.” He 
tapped the illuminated map. 
“Once we exit the main tunnel 
near the Ocmulgee mound here,” 
tapping again, “we’ll head down 
the dead-ender and then surface 
well to the east of Macon. Then, a 
kudzu-fouled walk in the Open. 
We may be able to use the old 
state highway — 57, I think — for a 
good part of the way. That should 
ease it a little for us.” 

Guest said, “That highway’s 
tom up and overgrown, 57 is — at 
least over here where we’re, gonna 
come out.” He shook his head. 
“Crazy.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” Yates said. 
"We’ll get there, Mr. Guest.” In 
live more minutes the briefing 
was over, and Yates turned us out 
of the office, out of the Tower, for 
the rest of the day. An open day. 

“You like to get some coffee, 
Cleo?” Guest asked me. 

“No thanks,” I said. “See you at 



six o’clock tomorrow morning.” 

I went back to my cubicle on 
Level 3, under. That’s where, a 
quarter of a century ago, my par- 
ents started from: Level 3.

The transit tunnels are dark; 
they smell of the dampness of 
concrete. Even before construc- 
tion on the domes of the Urban 
Nuclei had begun, the entire 
Federation-wide network of tun- 
nels was blasted into existence by 
an arsenal of immaculately sani- 
tary H-bombs: grrr-choom, grrr- 
choom, grrrrr-whumpf! Strangely, 
we don t use the tunnels that 
much. 

On the morning after our con- 
ference in the Human Develop- 
ment Tower, an open transit-car 
carried us in eerie silence to the 
Miami-Savannah juncture, where, 
before we turned into the Savan- 
nah tributary, I knew we were 
passing pretty darn close to the 
old Ocmulgee Mounds. At these 
mounds and the territory called 
the Ocmulgee Old Fields, the 
Creek Indians had long ago 
formed the Creek Indian Confed- 
eracy. Several prehistoric cultures 
had thrived here, too. 

I started wondering. Maybe the 
domes of the Urban Nuclei had 
been raised from the same im- 
pulse that had motivated Kheops 
in Egypt and the Mound Builders 
in Georgia. Oh, in these two 
cases I know the immediate mo- 
tives diverge: Pharoah wanted a 



ALLEGIANCES

splendid tomb whereas the In- 
dians wished their flat-topped 
pyramids to serve as the thrones 
of the gods. But if Pharoah be- 
lieved himself a deity, a god in- 
carnate, then his tomb was also a 
throne, and the common de- 
nominator in the two instances is 
humankind’s need to exalt some- 
thing larger than itself. A religious 
motive, finally. 

Anyhow, that’s my belief, and 
I’m not talking about the Ortho- 
Urban Church, either. I’ve tried 
to voice it once or twice, but 
these ideas, spilling from the lips 
of a twenty-two-year-old woman 
with red hair, elicit only peeved 
looks (“The girl thinks she s Ber- 
trand Russel, Tom”) or curt dis- 
missals (“Sophomoric bullshit, 
Clio”). So I reserve these rumina- 
tions now for accounts like this 
one. Except I probably won’t be 
writing any more accounts like 
this one. Circumstances change. 

But for the beam of a single 
headlamp, our resources- reclama- 
tion team rode in absolute dark- 
ness. Th e winds of our blast- 
borne passage smelled of con- 
crete, concrete and iron. Yates 
slowed at the Miami-Savannah 
juncture and negotiated the turn 
into the southeastward tributary 
of the subterranean network: 
Guest had to get out and switch 
the transit-rails. Then off we went 
again, the Ocmulgee Old Fields 
behind us, well to the west. We’d 
been traveling for three hours. 

I shouted into the resurging 
wind of our movement: “ Now can 
you tell us who we’re going 
after?” 



Turning his head, Yates permit- 
ted his thin profile to carve itself 
in the air: ‘ Wait till we’re out! 
You’ve waited this long!” 

In fifteen minutes the wind 
began to die, the walls to lose 
their dizzying speed, and we 
glided into what I could only 
think of as Dead-End Station: yel- 
low fluorescents casting a some- 
how greenish light over the plat- 
form here. You half-expected, 
when you were close enough to 
see more clearly, to find stalac- 
tites on the ceiling. Didn’t, 
though; too mercilessly hot. 

We got out and began unload- 
ing equipment and carrying it up 
to the platform. Yates wore a 
myriad tools on his low-slung 
belt, as well as a holster of artifi- 
cial leather: it contained a laser 
pistol. (One such weapon to each 
reclamation team, and the team 
leader carried it.) Then Yates 
pointed at the ventilation unit at 
the top of the tunnel’s final wall. 

“OK,” he said. “Let’s dismantle 
that grate.” 

Guest climbed up the mainte- 
nance rungs to the unit and began 
working to take the filter apart. 
The filter systems had been 
installed when the Federation had 
been worried about the tunnel’s 
Internal Environmental Control 
(IEC, if you like initials), fearing 
that the Open’s tainted atmo- 
sphere would spill into the net- 
work and strangle us with the 
wastes we had fled from. If that’s 
what we’d fled from. The Open 
had never been so foully tainted 
as that. Never. The first reclama- 
tion team had carried oxygen 
canisters and over-the-head masks

GALAXY 




(which made them look like star- 
tled rhesus monkeys when they 
put them on: perforated speakers, 
plastiglass eyes, and all), but its 
members hadn’t had to use this 
equipment. And ninety per cent 
of Atlanta’s people still believe 
you can’t go outside. Most of 
them, if they knew differently, 
still wouldn’t rush to re-colonize 
the wilderness. 

“This thing’s rusted,’’ Guest 
said, swaying up there on the 
maintenance ladder. “Won’t 
budge.” 

So yates had to go up and cut 
both the filter system atid the 
grate out of their moorings with 
the laser pistol. After the area 
around the ventilation unit had 
cooled, we all climbed through, 
weighted with paraphernalia, into 
the Open: Guest first, then me, 
then Newlyn Yates. 

And the first thing we saw was 
the deformed, rearing landscape: 
green temples, arabesques of 
Kiidzu, pagodas to the gods of 
rampant fertility. The Orient had 
invaded Georgia, invisible 
samurai crouched in the vines. 
The wilderness shouted at us, and 
the sky — this always amazed 
me — was a brilliant sky-blue. 

The job they gave Clio Noble 
was tying flaming-red markers on 
trees ana rotted fence posts, any- 
thing up-jutting. “Hell.” Alexan- 
der Guest said. “She don’t need 
to do that. You got a wrist- 
compass and I could smell our 
way back to the station.” He lifted 
his big head and whufUed two or 
three times at the air, a comic 
and lordly bear in the chapel of

What a spectacular year 1974 has 
been for our science-fiction list — more 
titles selling more copies to more peo- 
ple than ever before. 1974 was the 
year of RAMA — Arthur C. Clarke’s 
big bestseller that has already been 
back to press several times. Hard to 
keep up with the unprecedented 
reorders — but we’re coping, so that 
the book will be in stock at all 
times. .along with Arthur’s classic 
Childhood's End, now reissued and 
brilliantly repackaged. Look for them 
both! 

1974 was also the year of Icerigger, 
our own Alan Dean Foster’s survival 
novel that took off like a shot and is 
still outselling most other books in the 
category. Why? Who knows? Perhaps 
the marvelous Dean Ellis cover moved 
the books off the racks; or maybe the 
cover looked enough like the hard- 
cover bestseller Alive; or maybe all 
the Star Trek Log fans followed Foster 
to science fiction. Or maybe a combi- 
nation of all these factors — or maybe 
none. But we think the book sold its 
bloody head off because Alan is a 
damn good writer, and sf readers are 
desperately looking for the kind of ad- 
venture fiction he writes so well. 

Also in ’74, we introduced several 
top science-fiction authors to the 
list — authors who, for one reason or 
another, had never been published by 
Ballantine. Back in March, we 
brought out Frank Herbert’s classic 
chiller Under Pressure, a little gem 
that is already in its third printing and 
has become a permanent fixture on 
our backlist. Then there was Stanley 
G. Weinbaum — the best of, that is. 
Some of our sales honchos wanted to 
know “What’s a Weinbaum?” So they 
read the big beautiful collection that 
introduces our Classic Library — and 
they found out. L. Sprague de Camp 
appeared on our science-fiction list for 
the first time in ’74, as did Ray Gallun 
and — you guesses it! — Leigh Brackett! 
In addition to books by the old pros, 
we featured several smashing first

Now on to 1975 and January’s big 
book The Best of Planet Stories # 1 . 
edited by Eric John Stark’s favorite 
lady, Leigh Brackett. Planet Stories 
was that late, great pulp magazine of 
the 40s and 50s that featured strange 
adventures on other worlds — lots of 
larger-than-life swashbucklers and 
lovely damsels in distress. Quite a 
combo! Here is heroic fiction at its 
best — a dynamite collection culled 
from the pages of the greatest pulp sf 
magazine. Most of these stories have 
never been reprinted; many of them 
are appearing in paperback for the 
first time. Leigh has included by popu- 
lar demand (or at least on request by 
the publisher) her famous collabora- 
tion with Ray Bradbury, “Lorelei of 
the Red Mist,” first published back in 
1946 and now something of a classic. 
Then there’s “The Rocketeers Have 
Shaggy Ears” (what a title!) and Fred 
Brown’s immortal “The Star-Mouse” 
(who will ever forget Mitkey Mouse?)! 
And these s lots more in this big book, 
not least Leigh Brackett’s penetrating 
portrait of an era she helped make 
happen. Not to be missed!

Voyage to a Fore got ten Sun — a rousing 
space opera. Trader Zim was doomed 
to spend 20 years in isolation on some 
god-forsaken planet unless he agreed 
to accompany the President of Earth

was 1200 years old! It was going to be

“Suppose something happens to 
you. Guest,” Yates said. “Or to 
me. Maybe Clio. .Miz Noble,” 
he emended, “will have to get 
back here on her own.” I grinned 
at him, and the martinet in Yates 
revived. “Miz Noble will set the 
rags, and that’s it.” 

So off we went, angling north- 
east in order to intercept the 
ruins of State Highway 57, Clio 
Noble tying markers the color of 
her hair at intervals of roughly a 
hundred meters — unless the eclips- 
ing vegetation or a turn in our 
progress demanded them more 
often. Langorously swinging his 
machete, Indian Alex marched 
point. Newlyn Yates, good team 
leader that he was, brought up 
the rear. 

Two brown thrashers (once 
upon a time, the state bird) and a 
logy cardinal. Which was funny 
enough — in context, mind you- 
— to make me chuckle out loud; 
in that knee-high kudzu “brown 
thrashers” was especially good. 

“Don’t get to laughing so hard,” 
Yates said from behind me, “you 
forget to keep an eye open for 
snakes. They love this stuff.” 

Guest stopped and turned 
around. “My little brothers,” he 
said. 

I glared. He’d almost lopped off 
my head with his machete. 

‘Sense me,” he said, wiping 
his brow with one mesh sleeve. 
“It’s snakes, though. Since I’m an 
Indian they’re s’posed to be my 
little brothers: snakes, lizards, al- 
ligators, all like that. But I saw a 
green mamba at the Grant Park 
Zoo two years ago and got so

GALAXY 




crawly I had to get out of there.” 
His shoulders shuddered. “Went 
right home.” 

“If you’ve been out here be- 
fore,” Yates accused, “you’ve seen 
snakes plenty of times. ’ 

“Yeah, but I didn’t come ’spe- 
cially to look at ’em.” Then he 
said something both clumsily poet- 
ic and, right then, incomprehen- 
sible: “This Hothlejjoya ain’t no 
herpetologist: no sir. ’ And started 
hacking again. 

We did see some snakes, 
too — as we always did in the 
Open. One was a coral snake, up 
from Florida no doubt, that we 
gave a wide berth. Guest waved 
Yates and me around it and whis- 
pered to me as I went by, “Hope 
we don’t run across any asps, 
Cleo.” I thought he was being a 
smart Alex until I deduced from 
his head movements and inflec- 
tion that he really did hope that. 
Literally, he meant it. An asp in 
Georgia, a creature as alien as 
that! 

At one o’clock we found some 
shade, a knoll in the forest of pine 
and kudzu. Some moss actually 
grew at the base of the slash pine 
we decided to camp under. For 
lunch. We drank from our can- 
teens and v nibbled at our dried ra- 
tions. 

“Well,” I said. “How ’bout 
now?” 

Yates looked at me. “How ’bout 
now what?” Imperial annoyance. 

“Telling us who we’ve come 
after this time. I think it’s a pretty 
safe wager we won’t leak the word 
to someone disreputable.” 

“OK,” Yates said. I noticed that 
Guest, his heavy jaw working on a 



dehydrated vitamin bar, was gaz- 
ing off into the distant portals of 
kudzu, apparently indifferent to 
Yates’ impending revelation. 
Well, he’d told me he thought he 
knew what this mission was all 
about; maybe he did. < 

Yates said, “Do you know the 
name Carlo Bitler?” 

“I know we’re not looking for 
him,” I said. “He was a half-caste 
demagogue who was assassinated 
in the UrNu Capitol Building al- 
most forty years ago.” 

“Thirty-seven. And he wasn’t a 
demagogue, Miz Noble.” Archly 
he said this: very archly. 

"OK,” I said. “Beg your par- 
don. Why do you mention him?” 
“We’re looking for his wife,” 
Yates announced, “and for the son 
of the man who assassinated Bit- 
ler, Emory Coleman. We think 
the two of them are together. 
Fiona Bitler was Coleman’s 
teacher in a Van-Ed program for 
precocious children before the 
two of them disappeared.” 

“Great Maynard’s ghost!” I was 
really excited: that’s an expletive 
for thugboys and sentimental 
politicians. “How long ago was 
that?” 

“Thirty-two years.” 

“You’ve got it all memorized! 
How old does that make Fiona Bit- 
ler and the little boy she was 
teaching?” 

“The ‘little boy’ is now forty- 
one, Miz Noble, and Fiona Bitler 
has to be in her mid-sixties. In 
thirty years people age.” Which 
was about the stupidest thing I’d 
ever heard Yates say. He was 
melancholy, though. To cover his 
emotion he lifted the canteen and

drank. 

Indian Alex hadn’t stopped 
munching. None of what we a just 
been talking about impressed 
him, his eyes still veered away 
into pine copses and viny 
cathedrals. When he did look at 
us again, well into Yates’ and my 
awkward silence, he said, 
“Toombsboro was named for 
Robert Toombs, I think.” He 
wiped vitamin-bar crumbs from 
his hands. “Robert Toombs was 
an unusual man. Confederate 
general who escaped the yankees 
in the last year of the war and 
ended up in London. Came back 
to Georgia later, but never would 
swear his loyalty to the Union.” 

“Yes, sir,” Yates said, an- 
noyance surfacing again. “Old 
Toombs was a real jewel.” 

“Hitler’s your hero,” I said by 
way of mediation (they hadn t 
asked for it, though); “maybe 
Toombs is his. Everyone has his 
own heroes.” I remembered a 
story about Toombs that a profes- 
sor of mine had always relished 
telling: In an early year of the war 
the old secessionist had bragged 
to a friend that one Georgia 
brigade with cornstalks could defeat 
any bunch of yankees sent against 
them. After the war the friend 
reproached Toombs for this bit of 
brag. Well, Toombs drawled (my 
professor drawled it, anyhow), we 
could of — but them yankee bas- 
tuds wouldn’t fight with corn- 
stalks. (Ho ho.) But it wasn’t a 
story that would amuse Yates, 
though; so, out there in the 
Open, I didn’t tell it. 

“Not a hero of mine,” Guest 
said. “When that war broke out 



there wasn’t an Indian left in 
Georgia, least not officially: only 
white men and Negro slaves. But 
Toombs was a man who knew 
where he stood, that’s for sure.” 

“Let’s go,” Yates said. He was 
already standing up. 

“Wait a minute,” I said. 
“Heroes aside, what’re Fiona Bit- 
ler and that old pupil of hers 
doing out here near Toombsboro? 
Strange place for them to be, isn’t 
it?” 

Without looking at me Yates 
began jockeying his implement- 
lined belt into place over his hips. 

i ohan Trap’s farming out here, 
e reports say. He’s Fiona 
Bitler’s first cousin: son of her 
mother’s brother. When she and 
the boy left the city in ’34, they 
naturally went to Trap.” 

“And they’ve been living out 
here thirty years?” 

“Off and on. It isn’t completely 
clear.” 

“So why do we, in this funky 
Year of Our Lord, come out here 
to haul them back to a place they 
must’ve wanted out ofr” Which 
was a question that needed ask- 
ing. Most of the “indigenous sal- 
vageables” our resource reclama- 
tion teams brought back to the 
city had never lived in it before, 
had never been enfranchised. 
Fetching runaways was business 
we didn t engage in. Let the trash 
go, one of our more intellectual 
ward reps liked to say. 

“To persuade them to return. 
Emory Coleman’s a genius, and 
Mrs. Bitler’s husband s been vin- 
dicated over and over again for 
his so-called rabblerousing.

him, schools, housing projects, 
churches. The woman ought to he 
able to come back to that. She 
always wanted natural change, 
that’s why she was a teacher. She 
ought to be able to die in the city 
that finally recognized the right- 
ness of her husband’s goals. ” 

“Fine recognition,” I said. “Im- 
plementing the Retrenchment 
Edicts of ’35 and crushing that 
so-called ‘Glissador Revolt’ three 
years back, when there wasn’t any 
revolt at all; nothing physical any- 
how.” This was heresy, but Yates 
didn’t respond to it. His loyalties 
were cruelly divided: -the city 
employed him, but his pigmenta- 
tion suffused him with an al- 
legiance no mere emolument or 
law could undermine. Newlyn 
Yates wasn’t that sort of human 
being; a soldier maybe, but no 
mercenary.

of horseshoe bend 

About five o’clock on that first 
day we stumbled out of the green 
mosques and jumbled pagodas 
into an open area of sorts. A uni- 
versal groundcover of kudzu still 
tripped us up, but now it rose no 
higher than our upper shins: we 
waded through it like kids in the 
shallow end ol a recreation pool. 
Guest raked the blade of his 
machete through the vines and 
felt for the hidden surface. 

The machete clanged. Guest 
scraped at the ground-cover. 
“Well, here she is, Mr. Yates:

And it was. The vines had sim- 
ply grown across it. We followed 
the filigreed roadbed for a while, 
moving east, and had the easiest 
time of it the wilderness had so 
far granted us. Well before sun- 
down, though, we stopped, 
moved off the roadbed into a 
copse of deciduous trees (wild 
precans), and made our camp for 
the evening. 

Twilight still twinkling in the 
tall pines and pecans, Yates told 
us to go to bed: he would roust us 
out early, he said, so we could 
steal a march on the heat. We 
prepared to sleep on the ground. 

But tall thunderheads began 
rolling through the twilight from 
the northwest, and Yates ordered 
us to pitch our one-person tents 
in a kind of triangle, dig run-off 
trenches, and hurriedly finish 
supper. The woods began to 
boom, the branches of the trees 
to thrash about violently. Huge 
drops began to fall through the 
accumulating darkness and the 
stuttering leaves. 

Well, no stars this night; no 
bloated moon and no vivid, glit- 
tering constellations. Too bad. 
Those are things that make being 
a team member worth all the agi- 
tation of soul. From my two pre- 
vious trips with him I remem- 
bered that Yates had sometimes 
stayed up all night, transfixed, 
looking at the stars. (How did I 
know it was all night? Sometimes 
I stayed up, too, watching him.) 
Tonight, though, Yates crawled 
into nis tent before the worst of 
the deluge hit and fell soundly 
asleep. A feat I couldn’t emulate. It 
was too noisy. And my soul was 



agitated: we were going after 
Fiona Bitler and Emory Coleman! 

It rained an hour, at least. 
W’hen it stopped, I looked up and 
saw a shadowy bulk hunkering 
next to my tent: Alexander Guest, 
rocking on his heels in the slow, 
sloughing, red mud. “ ’Lo,” he 
said. 

“What’re you doing?” I said. 
Not too civilly, maybe. 

“First watch,” he said. “Yates 
gave me first watch. You can’t do 
it proper from a tent.” 

“Why do we need one at all?” I 
said. “Nothing out here but 
snakes, raccoons, and opossums.” 
The answer was that Yates did 
everything by the manual, even 
down to assigning watches in the 
middle of thunderstorms. 

“Can’t sleep, huh?” 

That question disturbed me a 
little. I was afraid (ashamed after- 
wards, though) that Guest was 
going to propose a mutual settling 
of the nerves, a little easy body- 
warming as a prelude to sleep. I 
said, “No. But look at Yates. 
Don’t you hate a man who can go 
off like that, and then stay off?” 

“I don’t hate anybody,” he said 
obliquely. Then, staring into the 
dark: “ ’Cept maybe Andrew Jack- 
son. I’ve never really forgiven 
Andrew Jackson.” 

“For what?” 

“For the way he treated In- 
dians, you know. When that man 
got elected President, the 
Civilized Tribes and ever’ other 
Indian in Georgia was doomed. In 
ten years, violatin’ first this trea- 
ty, then that, he had all of us 
cleared out of here: Yamacraw, 
Creek, Yuchi, Cherokee. That 



32 



GALAXY 




Jackson’s one dead fellow I wish 
was alive, jes’ so I could kill him 
again.” 

“I’d think his being dead so 
long revenge enough.” 

“No,” Guest shook his head. 
“Death is a sweetness, it’s the 
dying, you know, that’s the 
devil-bitch, always hungry for 
new meat. .1 wish ole Jackson 
was new meat again so I could 
feed him to the devil-bitch.” 

Death as Goddess, Death as 
Avenging Female. Well, Indians 
had considered the white man’s 
failure to isolate his woman dur- 
ing menstruation as the most 
heinous of obscenities. I could ac- 
cept the devil-bitch metaphor 
from Guest even though it would 
have angered me from anybody 
else; I could accept it without ap- 
proving it, just as I could under- 
stand but never approve the 
Indian’s fear and awe of a woman 
in her cycle. 

Thinking these things, I 
crawled out of my tent. It seemed 
rude to carry on a conversation 
Irom the comfort of my bedding 
while Guest squatted in the mud. 
Together we drew a log up to the 
rain-squelched ashes of our fire 
and sat down. Yates slept on. 
Should I assure Indian Alex that I 
was in a touchable condition? 

Instead I said, “You told me 
yesterday your name was an 
alias. ” 

“Sort of,” he said. “It’s the 
name on my birth certificate, but 
Alexander and Guest certainly 
ain’t Indian names. I’d be closer 
to it using something like Alexan- 
der X, the way some of them 
old-time black Muslims did. Like 



the one who got shot in New 
York, that Malcolm fellow. He 
didn’t know his real name was 
any more than I do mine — now.” 

Guest told me that he was the 
descendant of Cherokee Indians 
who had escaped into North 
Carolina at the time of the Great 
Removal in 1838 and 1839. 
Somewhere along the line a 
great-grandfather had taken the 
name Guest. “The reason for 
that,” the big man said, “is Guest 
is one of the most common forms 
of Gist, and George Gist was the 
anglo name of Sequoyah.” 

“Sequoyah? The inventor of the 
Cherokee syllabary?” 

“Yep. Which I can read. I got a 
nigh-on complete microfilm fac- 
simile of the Cherokee Phoenix. 
The Indian newspaper run off at 
New Echota up in old Gordon 
County. Got it back in my cubi- 
cle.” 

The other reason that Guest 
was an appropriate name for 
Alexander’s family, he explained, 
was that they were “guests ’ in the 
city: none of them had ever been 
granted enfranchisement. 

“What about Alexander?" I 
said. 

“Well, that’s from Alexander 
McGillivray. He was a famous 
Creek micco whose father’d been 
a Scotch trader. If you want to 
survive in the Urban Nucleus, 
you know, you can’t go around 
calling yourself Menewa. So I got 
me a compromise name: Alexan- 
der Guest. ’ 

“Why do you want to call your- 
self Menewa? Is that a Cherokee 
name?” 

“No. That’s the name of a 



ALLEGIANCES 



33 




Creek warrior who called himself 
Hothlepoya when he was young. 
That means Crazy War Hunter. 
He was an unusual man, Menewa 
was; more unusual than Robert 
Toombs, even.” 

And, talking slowly, the ground 
around us steaming so that ghosts 
seemed to be rising from the 
heavy, carnal earth, Alexander 
Guest told me the story of 
Menewa. 

By 1812 the Creek Confederacy 
had fragmented into pro- and 
anti-American actions; most of the 
Upper or Alabama Creeks were 
hostile to the new American na- 
tion, while many of the Lower or 
Georgia Creeks, hoping for the 
best, determined to support and 
befriend it. 

“A few of these Lower Creeks,” 
Guest said, “was in the pay of the 
U.S. government. Which you 
can’t blame ’em too much for- 
— since they was givin’ up land 
right and left and jes’ tryin’ to 
survive in a turned-upside-down 
world.” 

The principal culprit, as Guest 
saw it, was a half-Scot Lower 
Creek, a man named William 
Macintosh, who led his people in 
a massacre of the anti-American 
party of a chief named Weather- 
ford (“Then Scots jes’ seemed to 
have a way with the Indian gals”) 
after Weatherford had directed 
his own massacre of the soldiers 
and their families of Fort Mims in 
Alabama: a Civil War ante-dating 
the one that gave the world Wil- 
liam Tecumseh Sherman. 

“Got all that straight?” Guest 
asked. 

34 



“I don’t know. What about 
Menewa?” 

“Well, he was a chief of an 
anti-American faction called the 
Red Sticks, and he and Macintosh 
robably saw themselves as the 
eadliest of enemies. At the battle 
of Horseshoe Bend in 1812, the 
Red Sticks was making a despera- 
tion stand against Jackson’s Ten- 
nessee militia and some pro- 
American Indians, and things 
didn’t go too good for Menewa. 
Macintosh was there, and some 
Yuchi Indians, and maybe six- 
hundred or so Cherokee.’ 

“Cherokee?” 

“Well,” Guest said defensively, 
“they’d been promised all sorts of 
things. Some of ’em even had 
friends among the white men. 
Also, they was pretty sure this 
country never was gonna be all 
Indian again. They was doin’ what 
they thought they had to do, jes’ 
like Menewa’s Red Sticks was- 
— unless they was gettin’ paid to 
do it.” 

The battle lasted several hours. 
Jackson used cannons to bombard 
the Red Stick positions on the 
peninsula. Only seventy of the 
original nine-hundred Red Stick 
warriors survived, and three- 
hundred women and children 
were taken as captives. What 
about Menewa? 

“H e was shot seven times,” 
Guest said. “Seven times! None of 
'em kilt him, though. Then, when 
he woke up — he’d been left for 
dead in the brush, you know — he 
took a shot at one of Jackson’s 
militiamen. That fellow shot back. 
He drilled Menewa right through 
the cheek, but that didn’t kill 

GALAXY 




him, either. Menewa woke up in 
the middle of the night. He 
crawled to the river, found him a 
canoe, and floated down the Tal- 
lapoosa to some of the women and 
children who’d hidden themselves 
there. Made it alive, too.” 

“Sounds as tough as Rasputin,” 
1 said. 

“Sure. Far as survivin’ goes, 
anyhow. But the real Rasputins at 
the battle of Horseshoe Bend was 
Jackson and Macintosh. They took 
all the Red Sticks’ land, all of 
Menewa’s goods and property, 
too, and Macintosh probably went 
off thinkin’ he’d finished Menewa 
for good,” 

“He hadn’t?” 

“It took thirteen years, but 
Menewa got his revenge. Yessir!” 
In 1825, against both Creek 
custom and law, Macintosh (“who 
was gettin’ paid regular from the 
slate, mind you”) ceded to Geor- 
gia all the Creek land that hadn’t 
already been signed away in past 
treaties. 

“So the Creeks, the big miccos 
who hadn’t been talked to, got to- 
gether and decided to kill ole 
Mac. On May Day a bunch of ’em 
attacked his house and killed the 
bastard. His son-in-law, too. A lot 
ol Georgia history writes this up 
as some sort of tragedy, Cleo, but 
it was only what the ole traitor 
deserved. He knew it, too. You 
bet he did. The best part, though, 
is this: it was Menewa who actu- 
ally killed Macintosh.” 

Despite this triumph over his 
rival, Menewa lived out a story 
whose conclusion wasn’t so happy. 
In 1826 Menewa went to 
Washington himself to make a

new treaty. He didn’t give up any 
new land, but he promised the 
loyalty of himself and his people 
to the of the United States. 

“The land got took over, any- 
how,” Guest said. “Governor 
Troup was a cousin of Macintosh, 
and ne didn’t give a damn how 
many white men tramped all over 
the Creek and Cherokee ter- 
ritories. He jes’ said to hell with 
this U.S. gov’ment’s treaty, and 
pretty soon some of the Creeks 
was beggin’ for food or livin’ in 
the woods and swamps and tryin’ 
to get by there. Coweta Town, 
the capital of the Lower Creeks, 
was full of white land speculators, 
Cleo, and finally a micco named 
Eneah Emathla got some of the 
Creeks together to fight it. That’s 
when Jackson, who was now your 
president, you know, told his sec- 
retary of war to Send troops in 
and smash up this ‘rebellion.’ 
Know who helped the white sol- 
diers do it, Cleo?” 

Cicadas were whirring in the 
undergrowth; the night sky looked 
like a dyer’s vat full of torn bed 
sheets. “Not Menewa?” I said. 

“Yep. Him and about two- 
thousand of his followers. ” 

“Why?” 

“Because in ’25, you know, he’d 
pledged his loyalty to the U.S. 
gov’ment. He’d even taken to 
wearin' a general’s uniform, stan- 
dard army style, and someone in 
Washington promised him and his 
followers they wouldn’t have to 
trek off to Oklahoma like the rest 
of them.” 

“He sold out his people,” I 
said. 

“He kep’ his word. And the 
36 



gov’ment broke its. They marched 
Menewa, a battered ole man, off 
with all them others, never to 
come back. And some who saw 
that ole Red Stick say he wept to 
go.” 

“Look,” I said. “He put his ab- 
stract honor above the material 
well-being of the Creeks. He gave 
his allegiance foolishly, then acted 
upon it foolishly.” 

“Damn straight,” Guest said, 
“considerin’ who he gave it to. 
They never once put their, uh, 
abstract honor above material 
well-being.” Groaning like an ar- 
thritic septuagenarian, he stood 
up and kicked languidly at the 
muddy ashes of our fire. 

Questioningly, I looked up at 
him. 

“Your watch, Cleo,” he said. 
“You can wake Yates in a coupla 
hours.” Then he lumbered over to 
his rain-sopped tent, took off his 
boots, and went to bed.

That night I got about two 
hours sleep. We borke camp at 
four in the morning and moved 
out; eastward on kudzu-carpeted 
Highway 57. In thirteen hours we 
probably traveled about thirteen 
old-style miles. (Twice we saw 
buckshot-riddled, rusted signs 
saying things like Gordon 12, Ir- 
winton 21.) The going was so bad 
because in places the asphalt had 
crumbled like a stale graham 
cracker; briary thickets had reas- 
serted their primacy. 

A little after Gordon 12, Irwin- 

GALAXY 




ton 21, upon which I had tied a 
red marker, I said, “There’s got to 
be a better way.” 

“Like what? ’ Yates said. 

“How about a belicraft?” 
“There’s two in the whole city 
now. Besides, some redneck out 
here would open fire if he saw 
one.” 

Having got a little beyond the 
junction of Highways 57 and 18 
(the latter of which led to the old 
town of Gordon), we stopped in 
the evening and made camp 
again. Five o’clock or so. While 
gathering firewood with Guest, I 
asked him if he had known that 
our “targets” were Fiona Bitler 
and Emory Coleman. Through an 
opening in the trees I could see 
Yates shedding his gear and rag- 
ging rubbish out of the circle of 
our proposed encampment. To 
me, it seemed a good idea to 
know where he was. 

Not, however, to Guest. 
"Sure,” he rumbled. “I knew'.” 
“How?” My voice was quieter 
than the Indian’s: a shush by 
means of example, I hoped. 

“I was the one that met Trap 
when he come into the city. I’m 
not employed bv the Human De- 
velopment Commission, you 
know. Usually I work at one of 
the dome’s receiving points. It’s a 
job you can’t do if you’re en- 
franchised, you might get cor- 
rupted off the True Path.” 

“But Yates said you’d been out 
in this area before.” 

“Have. But not any team 
member on a rr squad. Since I 
work at the old Interstate 20 Re- 
ceiving Point, I’m also a agent be- 
tween the city and some of the 



farmers out there. There ain’t a 
single s«lf-sufficient Urban Nu- 
cleus in the whole Federation, 
spite what the councilmen and 
ward reps say. Amazes me some 
people don’t believe the truth of 
that. Anyhow, I’ve been into the 
Open beaucoups of times. — And a 
few miles from here w 7 e ain’t 
onna have to wade through 
udzu no more. Wouldn’t’ve had 
to do any of this if the city wasn’t 
so set on motherhennin’ its 
chicks.” 

“Did you set Trap up for his 
drugging?” 

“I did. But that business about 
puttin’ a implant tab in his nape is 
jes’ a lot of eyewash. Yates thinks 
it happened, but it didn’t. Hell, I 
knew where the man lived, and 
the fellows at Grady Memorial got 
all the other information out of 
him with the hypnotizin’, and the 
drugs too. Surprised ’em, what he 
had to say. You see, I got a friend 
at the hospital.” 

“Why’d you set Trap up? He 
must’ve trusted you.” 

“’Cause enfranchised or not, I 
had to sign a oath to carry out the 
city’s biddin’ — in all things, you 
know — before they’d even give 
me a job.” Holding two fistfuls of 
dry kindling, my gingerbread In- 
dian paused and looked intently at 
me. “And, Miz Noble, I put ny 
name on the paper, I put my 
name on the paper — with no one 
sayin’ he’d scalp me if I didn’t.” 
He started to turn. 

I caught his elbow. “Do you 
know why the authorities want 
Mrs. Bitler and Coleman back in 
the city?” 

“Probably not for a ticker-tape 

37 



ALLEGIANCES 




parade, Miz Noble.” 

“Then what?” 

“Old Trap told the doctors his 
cousin and her pupil, who calls 
himself Nettlinger now instead of 
Coleman (Nettlinger was his real 
father’s name, you know, and he 
was the fellow who shot 
Bitler) — anyhow, Trap said they’d 
spent several years in New Free 
Europe: to be eggzac’, the Scan- 
dinavian Polity. That’s dangerous. 
Now they’re both back, the infec- 
tion might spread — sort of like 
kudzu, I guess.” 

“So what will the city do?” 

“Question ’em, lock ’em up 
someplace. Maybe worse. I don t 
know.” Guest broke free of me 
this time, and of my questioning, 
and made his heavily delicate way 
back to the clearing, where Yates 
had begun, with the fuel he had 
gathered, to boil some drinking 
water. I just stood there. Oh, 
Grand Zoe, what a picture of per- 
plexity I would have made, what 
a study in bewilderment. 

Hanging over the trees like 
lamps, stars abounded that night: 
they freckled the matte sky with 
gold, silver, silver-blue, red: a 
carnival of constellations. It was 
splendidly gaudy, like a gauche 
hat. 

Yates, propped up on his el- 
bows and forearms, his head 
thrown back, began without 
prompting to talk: 

“Before I’d ever been into the 
Open, I used to dream about 
doing what we’re doing now. See- 
ing the stars firsthand; not on 
film, or in picture-books, or done 
up by some crazy foreigner with 



rings and haloes around them, 
like they showed us in art- 
appreciation class. I wanted real 
stars, just like these. 

“Even inside the dome I felt 
connected to them, you know: 
they were like missing parts of my 
body the nerve ends wouldn’t let 
me forget. Or maybe like pulled 
teeth that had little radio trans- 
mitters inside them, so that even 
when they’d been dropped down 
the disposer-converter in some 
dentist s office, they still kept 
sending me messages: an all-the- 
time toothache, no matter what I 
did. So I tried everything I could 
to get close to them, to the stars 
on the Other Side. They had 
something to tell me, you know, 
gaps to fill in. 

“When I was fourteen a man 
who worked for my father in the 
Biomonitor Agency — his name 
was Ardrey, I won’t forget that- 
— started taking me combcrawl- 
ing: you know, using girderboots 
and mesh gloves, expensive mag- 
netized equipment, to climb over 
the inside of the dome. Scary as it 
could be, even when you was just 
practicing easy assaults out on the 
perimeter of the city and doing a 
lot of vertical climbing instead of 
hanging upside-down over the 
whole skyscape. I did that, too, 
though. Partly so Ardrey wouldn’t 
think I was a baby, but mostly 
because combcrawling, when I 
did it, I felt like I was pressing 
myself that much closer to the 
real sky outside and the stars hid- 
ing behind the dome. The dome 
was just another skin to get 
through, and I tried to get 
through it combcrawling, scared 



38 



GALAXY 




as I was. 

“Then Ardrey and I had an ar- 
gument. It was about this old 
woman who died on Level 9, 
under. Since he worked for the 
Bio Agency, he had her cubicle 
burned out — even though she had 
the whole thing made up like the 
inside of a spaceship. Neatest and 
craziest thing I ever saw. We’d 
gone down there because I’d chal- 
lenged Ardrey to go look at a 
deader in person. I think I 
thought dying was one way to get 
outside tne dome, scarier even 
than combcrawling but probably 
more effective, too. Anyway, Ar- 
drey ordered this spaceship- 
cubicle she was living in, with 
these fake viewscreens of planets 
and stars, eaten up by flame- 
torches and refurbished for a new 
occupant. I hated him for doing 
it, I called him names. Stopped 
combcrawling, too; just never 
went with him no more. My 
lather had to sell back all the 
equipment he bought me. 

“Three or four years later Ar- 
drey was killed in a combcrawling 
accident. Now it’s outlawed, no- 
body can do it. And I’m sorry I 
never made it up with that man, 
know-it-allish as he liked to act. 
Ardrey just did what my father 
would have ordered him to do if 
Ardrey hadn’t gone ahead and 
done it himself. Simple as that.

couldn’t see them. Can you tell 
me, why is that? Sitting here 
looking at them, I ache ten times 
as bad as when I was fourteen 
years old and girderclimbing in 
order to press myself right 
through the skin of the dome to 
the torn-off pieces of myself: ten 
times as bad. Now why is that? 
Can you tell me, why is that?” 

But he didn’t really expect an 
answer, and Alezander Guest and 
I, sipping at our metal cups of 
insta-caffe, didn’t break the si- 
lence. The Ferriswheel lights in 
the sky kept turning. 

Yates rousted us out early the 
next morning, before sunrise, and 
we were on our way again. In two 
hours’ time, just as tne sun had 
begun to send sparkles through 
the foliage, the foliage itself fell 
away and we were staring at 
cleared fields. Too, the kudzu on 
57 had been hacked aside and 
contained. We walked out of the 
vines and onto a recently com- 
pacted and graveled surface. On 
previous trips into the Open I had 
never seen anything like this, no 
manicured roadbeds arid certainly 
no cultivated fields the size of 
these: garden plots and arbors I’d 
seen, but not farms, not grazing 
land. Well, Guest had hinted at 
such a possibility. 

“Can I stop stringing up these 
silly rags?” I asked Yates. The 
road stretched out before us like 
an invitation, whitewashed 
wooden fences paralleling it on 
both sides. 

“Sure,” Yates said amiably, 
coming up from the rear to lead 
us. “This is a civilized pocket.’ 

39 




My surprise to you, a pift for the 
two days’ slogging we ve done.” 
He looked around happily. “They 
told me it’d be here.” 

Guest said, “Did they tell you 
it uz more’n a pocket?” 

Yates, sweat in the hollows of 
his eyes, stared at the big man. 

“There’s a strip of cultivated 
land through here,” Guest went 
on, “all the way to Savannah. And 
some of the towns have people in 
’em, too. Not Toombsboro, it 
don’t. But I rwinton and 
Wrightsville and Vidalia and 
beaucoups of others. Savannah’s 
got thirty-thousand people, at 
least. Ships still run in and out of 
it, that’s probably how Bitler and 
Nettlinger got to the Scandinavian 
Polity and back.” 

Blank of all expression, his eyes 
maybe a little caged-looking, 
Yates said, “Guest, you’re crazy.” 
But he had been hit with an In- 
dian club and was standing dazed 
on doomed legs: just to hold him 
up, I wanted to embrace him. 

“Wait till you see all the walkin’ 
’lucinations I can conjure, then,” 
Guest said. “Far as surprisin’ us 
with this gravel road goes, we’re 
gonna run into U.S. 441 at 
Irwinton — and it run straight on 
up to old Interstate 20. We 
could’ve saved two days and a 
heck of lot of boot leather if the 
ole Com Authority had let us 
come by way of ’em.” He spit into 
57’s loose gravel. 

“Guest,” Yates began. 
“Guest. .” Then, to both of us: 
“Come on.” 

We walked in the sunshine 
down the gravel road: right out of 
Erskine Caldwell, we were. If 



we’d had fishing poles, the scene 
would have been perfect. Eventu- 
ally we passed a house, and a man 
on a parboiled, rustpurpled trac- 
tor came down its enclosed drive 
pulling a flat-bedded hay wagon. 
After expressing, by his move- 
ments more than anything else, 
his distrust and suspicion, the 
man said, “Yeah, old Jonah Traps 
lives on the other side of Irwin- 
ton. Get in. Take you that far at 
least. 

Bald and leathery of neck, he 
did what he said he would- 
— carrying us right into the Irwin- 
ton town square, where he let us 
off. Coming in, I noted that U.S. 
441 bisected our own “highway” 
and ran off to the north, there to 
connect with Interstate 20 (as In- 
dian Alex alleged) out of Atlanta. 
Anyhow, by some strange trans- 
mutation, we had all traveled into 
a rural community redolent of the 
life depicted on old John Deare 
and International ' Harvester 
calendars. (It was popular early 
last year to decorate your cubicles 
with reproductions of 
“Americana.” Now I was a piece 
of Americana myself: a living 
curiosity. And a curious one, too.) 
We watched our benefactor’s trac- 
tor chug around a corner. 

“Runs on methane,” Guest 
said. “Distilled from pig’s shit, or 
any other kind of droppin’s you 
care to use.” 

Yates looked at the Indian with 
distaste. 

“No worse than the city’s waste 
converters,” I said. 

A few people staring at us from 
store windows and chairs under 
awnings, we went on through the

little town, still on Highway 57, 
and followed the gravel road to- 
ward the site of old Toombsboro. 
The fields on either side of us 
waved with beans, or cotton, or 
com. 



we got closer and closer to 
the dwelling place of our 
“targets,” I began thinking about 
what sort of living accommoda- 
tions a man like Trap would re- 
ceive if he lived in the Urban 
Nucleus. Since most of the sur- 
faceside ghettoes had been razed 
(they had tom down Bondville in 
the conciliatory aftermath of the 
“Glissador Revolt”), he would 
most likely go under: most likely 
Level 7, or 8, or maybe even 9. 
The circles of Dantes Hell, our 
cynical professor types always 
called them. Except that in the 
UrNu scheme of things, the inno- 
cent get punished along with the 
guilty. A few of the absolutely 
shiftless sort have been consigned 
to the Big Bad Basement, but you 
can find plenty of those upstairs, 
too. 

On Level 9, for instance, you 
have people whose greatest crime 
consists of being too young or too 
old or maybe of having only a 
“marginally utilizable skill,” like 
grocery-stocking or message- 
running or waiting tables. 

In addition, all the unenfranch- 
ised live on Level 9, which 
meant — as I had either forgotten 
or never really considered — that 
Alexander Guest had a cubicle in 
this final ring of our parochial in- 
ferno. 

What were the sins ot these 



damned, what enormities were 
they guilty of? 

My father would say, “You’re a 
bleeding heart, Clio. Almost 
everybody’s lived under, one time 
or another. Forty-five meters up 
or down just don’t make that 
much difference.” 

And Mama Lannie, twirling her 
chiffon sleeves, would say, “Oh, 
she’s just young yet, Sanders, 
that’s how she’s supposed to feel.” 

As if sympathy were a glandular 
condition like acne. So that I 
would go off remembering how 
Dante had put the perpetrators of 
passionate crimes in less abysmal 
circles of Hell than those who had 
committed sins of malice and 
fraud. Which meant, to me any- 
how, that whereas I ought to be 
sentenced only to Level 7 for kill- 
ing my parents in an idealistic 
rage, Atlanta’s councilmen and 
ward reps — for their manifold, 
premeditated treacheries — ought 
to find brimstone and pitchforks 
waiting for them on our two 
nethermost strata. Sayeth Dante, 
it is more heinous to abuse the in- 
tellect, which separates us from 
the beasts, than to abuse the 
emotions. Therefore, I was proud 
of my overactive and probably 
misfunctioning glands. 

On Highway 57, without ever 
having met him, I was proud of 
Jonah Trap for shunning the 
whale’s belly of the Urban Nu- 
cleus and forging a life for himself 
and his family in the Open. A 
black man — a poorly educated 
black man, mind you — in the ren- 
ovated plantation house of a 
one-time “marster.” No Level 9 
for him, no Level 9 for his brood.

sesame street down on 
marster’s plantation 

When we reached Trap’s house, 
we paused before it like as- 
tronauts on the rim of an unex- 
pectedly quartz-shot, lunar crater. 
In awe we stood there, or at least 
Yates and I did. From the graded 
roadbed we looked across a lake- 
sized lawn whose far edge, im- 
mediately before the ante bellum 
mansion itself, was dominated by 
two gnarled, top-heavy oaks. His 
and her trees, they’d been called 
in New England: one for the Mas- 
ter and one for his Dame. Pools 
of shade undulated on the grass. 
The mansion had a portico sup- 
ported by four Doric columns, 
and beyond the living 
complex — which included a neat, 
single-story structure off to the 
right — you could see the begin- 
nings of terraced red fields. 

A shieldlike, wooden sign on 
the gate by the roadbed said 
Phoenix Plantation. A series of 
starlike points on the sign had 
been connected to make this fig- 
ure: 

“What’s that?” I said. 

“The constellation Cygnus,” 
Yates replied without a second’s 
hesitation. “Sometimes called the 
Swan, or the Northern Cross. But 
it could be a phoenix, too, I 
guess: any sort of firebird that’s 
born again every night.” 

A breeze rocked the sign. It 
was only nine o’clock or so in the 
morning, and I felt like I had 
been born again, right there on 
the edge of Jonah Trap’s lawn: the 
Athena of Noble stepping from 

42 



the sundered, feverish forehead of 
Newlyn Yates. Indian Alex, un- 
perturbed by all this, was our 
staid midwife. 

“Well, let’s go see if anybody’s 
home,” I said. And I struck out 
up the long, circular drive that 
passed behind the oaks in front of 
the mansion. Scufflings behind 
me indicated that I was being fol- 
lowed. 

A venerable-appearing black 
woman answered my knock at the 
wide, shaded door. I asked for 
Jonah Trap. She introduced her- 
self as. .Fiona Bitler, cousin of 
the man who owned the Phoenix 
Plantation; and without asking us 
who we were she invited us in, 
graciously. 

Waxed parquetry in the an- 
teroom. An enormous chandelier. 
An imposing, carven china 
cabinet. Silence and coolness such 
as you might anticipate finding in 
an Ice Palace. And then, as we 
trailed the shorts-clad woman into 
an adjoining room (I hope I have 
legs that good when I’m sixty-five, 
and that they don’t interfere with 
my looking venerable): the al- 
together incongruous sounds of 
children laughing. 

“Come sit down with us,” Mrs. 
Bitler said. “We’ve just started 
school for Jonah’s grandchildren. 
As for Jonah, you’ll have to wait 
till noon to see him.” 

School. 

For the first time since coming 
into the Open together, Yates and 
Guest exchanged a sympathetic 
glance — but, along with me, they 
followed their hostess through the 
sliding wooden doors to the left of 
the long foyer and into an ele- 

GALAXY 




gant, high-ceilinged “classroom.” 
Mrs. Bitler motioned us to a row 
of rocking chairs behind the five 
black children, three boys and 
two girls, who were sitting on the 
(loor and who did not turn their 
heads as we entered. Their gazes 
were fixed on the screen of a vid- 
eoplayback unit mounted on a 
high metal stand. Since I saw no 
electrical outlets or fixtures in the 
entire room, the complex must 
have drawn its power from bat- 
teries. The power source made no 
difference to the kids; they were 
successively intent, bemused, ap- 
prehensive, raucous, puzzled, and 
quietly delighted, all in accord 
with the images unwinding on the 
screen and the sounds sputtering 
out of the unit’s speakers. A 
school of no little gaiety. 

I leaned forward to watch: pup- 
pets, cartoons, animal films, 
adults singing and talking with 
children, letters and numbers 
flashing by, all of it spliced to- 
gether with quick cuts and re- 
markable elan. Indian Alex, 
whose chair rested on the hard- 
wood floor instead of the rug, had 
to keep himself from rocking in 
time to the activity: his move- 
ments made the floor squeak. 
Yates, holding himself erect 
(tricky in a rocking chair), just 
looked bewildered.

Mrs. Bitler told us. “When I

purposes. You had to give cause 
for wanting the tapes, and sign for

them — but you could get them. 
The year after I left, the tapes 
were proscribed; nobody got to 
use them, not for any reason.” 

On the screen two puppets, 
apparently outer-space creatures, 
were examining a telephone. 
They bobbed up and down, their 
googly eyestalks bouncing, and 
made high-pitched, repetitive 
noises: “Yip yip. .yip yip 

yip. .yip yip.” Trap’s grandchil- 
dren, all of them under six, I’d 
say, were giggling. When the 
video-taped telephone rang and 
the unearthly creatures plunged 
out of sight in panic, the kids guf- 
fawed and bounced about and cuf- 
fed each other. Guest was laugh- 
ing, too: a close-mouthed, re- 
sonating chuckle. 

“Is that educational?” Yates 
said. 

“In a way, I suppose,” Mrs. Bit- 
ler said. “It’s certainly funny. ” A 



ALLEGIANCES

new sequence was on now, 
though: an animated alphabet, 
each letter surrealistically 
metamorphosing into the one fol- 
lowing it. 

“How did Mr. Trap get these 
tapes?” I asked. 

“He bought them from a man 
whose father had taken them from 
an educational television station in 
the evacuated university town of 
Athens. The video equipment 
Jonah had put together by an 
electronics hobbyist in Savannah. 
He has almost two years’ worth of 
these tapes; he used them to start 
Gabriel’s and Michael’s education, 
not knowing what else he could 
do for them. Jonah can read, but 
only just.” 

We watched for fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Although Guest 
was engrossed in the program, 
Yates still had not loosened up. I 
touched the arm of Mrs. Bitler’ s 
chair and said, “We didn’t come 
only to see Mr. Trap. We came to 
see and talk to you also, Mrs. Bit- 
ler, and the man you took out of 
the city with you in ’34. Gerard 
Coleman. Gerard Nettlinger. 
Whichever of those names he 
goes by now.” Yates, whose reac- 
tion I had been unsure of, looked 
past Mrs. Bitler at me with an 
expression suggesting gratitude: 
I’d done something right! 

“How did you know we were 
here?” she asked. “We haven’t 
been, you see, for that terribly 
long: two or three months. In 
fact, Emory’s been to Europe and 
back — again — since we arrived 
here in. .what?. .the middle of 
April?” That was old-style dating, 
not one of the Federation’s “sea- 

44 



sonal” months. 

Yates glanced at Guest as if 
surprised by the big man’s presci- 
ence: hadn’t Guest, just that 
morning, mentioned the Scan- 
dinavian Polity? 

“We learned Trap was your 
cousin,” I said, “and just sup- 
posed you would be here. ” 

Fortunately Mrs. Bitler did not 
ask how we had learned that Trap 
was her cousin or how we had 
known where he lived. “Well,” 
she said instead, “you don’t have 
to wait till noon to talk to me. 
This is almost over.” We waited. 
When the program ended, she 
turned off the video-playback 
unit, then called to the children’s 
mothers, who had been at the 
back of the house in the kitchen. 
Casta and Georgia, their names 
were. They nodded politely to us 
and herded their children into the 
wing of the house giving off the 
classroom. Mrs. Bitler led us 
through another high-ceilinged 
room to the cool, grey kitchen 
they’d just evacuated. 

“This is a good place to talk,” 
she said, and we all sat down at a 
round oaken table. 

Through the screened-in 
porch behind the kitchen I could 
see a grape arbor in the back 
yard, a portion of the cultivated 
field we had seen from the road, 
and an adjacent orchard beyond 
the arbor: these were peach trees, 
Mrs. Bitler said, and that’s where 
the men were, out there picking 
the fruit. Trap and his family 
were people who still divided 
their labors into men tasks and 
women tasks. That was the only 

GALAXY 




relic of unenlightened agrarian life 
predisposing me against them, 
and Fiona Bitler, a woman who 
had lived once in the shadow of 
her husband’s passionate crusad- 
ing, didn’t seem at all perturbed 
by the dichotomy. A breeze lifted 
the kitchen curtains, and the 
planet seemed to stretch out 
around us like a new Eden (the 
inan-and-maiden opposition still 
sadly intact). In comparison, 
though, most of the other “indi- 
genous salvageables” we had gone 
out after haa been living like fer- 
reting beasts. 

Yates said, “Where is Mr. Col- 
eman, Mrs. Bitler?” 

“It’s Nettlinger now. When he 
was old enough to decide for him- 
self, he began using his real 
father’s name again.” Another of 
Guest’s assertions corroborated. 
“At any rate, he’s asleep. You’re 
not likely to see him until this 
evening; he functions best at 
night, and, like an owl, that’s 
when he comes out.” 

“He uses the name of the man 
who assassinated your husband?” 
Yates asked, his long, nervous 
hands poised on their fingertips 
over the table. 

“It’s his father’s name, isn’t it?” 
said Guest, who was leaning back 
in his chair, hands clasped at his 
middle. “Whose name you want 
him to use? W'hose name you 
use?” 

I could see Yates emotionally 
staggering, first from Mrs. Bitler’s 
revalation, then from Guest’s 
midlly delivered, but unexpected 
assault: so vulnerable under the 
obsolete, martial armor he af- 
fected in the field. “But his 



mother remarried ” Yates coun- 
tered, looking from the composed 
Indian to the composed black 
woman, “and his new father offi- 
cially adopted him.” 

“Yes,” Mrs. Bitler said. 

“Well, do you approve of the 
change? From Coleman to the 
name of your husband’s assassin?” 
His hands looked as if they would 
momentarily flee from him. 

“As a boy Emory had no say in 
the matter. The name was 
changed, lipity lip, just like that. 
Later he decided on the other. 
My approval — your approval- 
— anyone else’s approval — is be- 
side the point.” She looked at 
Yates. “Isn’t it?” 

“But how did it make you feel?” 
“Emory isn’t his father, Mr. 
Yates, but his father lives in him. 
We don’t renounce our pasts out 
of hand, even if we don’t like 
them. We don’t renounce our 
origins, our birthrights, our 
kindred. We acknowledge them at 
least. Then, if we don’t like them, 
we move away from them into our 
selves.” Fiona Bitler laughed. 
“Now, that’s the sort of didactic 
pronouncement only a queen or a 
comfortable old whore can get 
away with, I give you leave to 
classify me as you like.” 

“A B C,” a thin voice said from 
the door. “E F G.” It was one of 
the kids who’d been watching the 
video-playback unit: a boy wear- 
ing only a pair of cotton under- 
pants. He didn’t look much more 
than two. 

Fiona Bitler motioned the child 
to her, and he climbed into her 
lap. “This is Carlo,” she said. 
“Jonah’s youngest grandchild.”

She introduced us all around. 

“Hello, Carlo,” I said. 

The boy looked me directly in 
the eye. “A B C,” he said seri- 
ously. “EFG. ..HIJK." Paus- 
ing in the appropriate spots, he 
continued successfully to the end. 

“Carlo has a twenty-six letter 
vocabulary,” Mrs. Bitler said. The 
namesake of her dead husband, 
the boy stayed in her lap for the 
rest of our conversation, occasion- 
ally reciting his letters in a voice 
that didn’t disrupt Mrs. Bitler’s 
narration but provided a contra- 
puntal undercurrent to it. And 
she took us back to 2034: 

1 KIDNAPPED EMORY, she 
began. “Before that, I worked 
very, hard to put myself in a posi- 
tion to teach the boy, not know- 
ing exactly what I would do once I 
achieved this goal. I had followed 
Emory’s development from only a 
month or two after Carlo’s death 
down to the moment he was 
placed in my Van-Ed classroom, 
you see, and I felt an affinity with 
him for several reasons, not 
merely because he was the son of 
my husband’s murderer. 

“Maybe one reason was mater- 
nal: Carlo and I had never had 
any children. Planned them, yes, 
but never had them. The 
strongest motivation, though, was 
the fact that Emory and I shared 
a similar questionable blessing: 
precociousness. It had brought 
me to the attention of the Educa- 
tion Authority of the Human De- 
velopment Commission at the age 
of four and lifted my entire family 
out of the Bondville ghetto into 
Tower housing. But that was just 



after the dome was completed, 
before the gradual return of a 
claustrophobically bred repres- 
siveness. I don’t know what it ac- 
complished for Emory, this pre- 
cociousness, until he was accepted 
into one of the special-education 
programs. I know that his mother 
and her new husband, John Adam 
Coleman, lived in a Level 5 cubi- 
cle, under. So it didn’t accomplish 
for his family what it had once ac- 
complished for mine. 

“He was eight when I met him 
for the first time, a thin, spindly, 
almost palsied-looking little boy 
who could have passed for an au- 
tistic child except for his occa- 
sional lapses into sociability. He 
liked to draw, almost always in 
black or purple crayon, and some- 
times he would come out of his 
corner to show us these produc- 
tions. Mockery, some of these 
drawings seemed. 

“Toward the end of that year 
— the only one we had together 
inside the dome — he must have 
discovered who I was, what obli- 
que relationship I had to him. 
After that, mockery emerged in 
his actions as well as his drawings. 
He insisted on dragging odd re- 
minders of his father, Carlo’s 
murderer, into the classroom. The 
principal one was an old instruc- 
tional film of his father’s: Net- 
tlinger had been a dentist, and 
Emory, who was the class projec- 
tionist when we showed films, 
would run this film even when 
another one was scheduled. You 
couldn’t stop him, he wouldn’t be 
reasoned with, and Fiona 
Bitler. .well, Fiona Bitler was 
losing control of things. So I 



46 



GALAXY 




asked for help. 

“The Van-Ed people gave me a 
psychologist from the Human De- 
velopment Commission, a 
middle-aged man with a pleasant 
disposition but something out of 
kilter in his eyes. Greer. Dr. 
Gregory Greer. The man tried. 
He tried his best. But what hap- 
pened was, he quickly alienated 
Emory and wrenched nis own ob- 
jectivity apart by falling in love 
with me. I don’t know which 
happened first, maybe they occur- 
red simultaneously — but Greer 
couldn’t admit either of them to 
himself: he was a bachelor, his 
commitment was wholly to 
sychological troubleshooting, and 
e didn’t know how to handle a 
collapse on two fronts, the per- 
sonal as well as the professional. I 
don’t think I’m flattering myself 
about the personal aspect of the 
situation; I may have even en- 
couraged the man — in ways too 
subtle for me to pinpoint — to re- 
linquish his objectivity. I don’t 
know. I hope to God I never find 
out for certain. 

“The result, oddly, was that 
Greer somehow threw Emory 
back into a strange sort of sym- 
pathy with me. Finally Greer suf- 
fered a nervous breakdown in the 
classroom where I taught: he 
came in the evening when nobody 
was there and set fire to Emory’s 
drawings and the old film that the 
boy had been showing. 

“Two days later Emory asked 
me to take him away from his 
parents. He said he wanted to 
live with me. During this same 
week, of course, Greer was hos- 
pitalized, and my life seemed as

up in the air as it had been after 
Carlo’s death. Sick I was: deeply, 
hollowly sick.” Fiona Bitler stared 
into the peach orchard beyond 
the screened porch, a black Isis 
recalling her struggle to resurrect 
in her own life and work the 
image of her husband and the 
promise of their unborn children. 
Little Carlo was now blithely say- 
ing his numbers. “How I was tug- 
ged,” Fiona Bitler said at last, 
now I was cruelly tugged.” Her 
arms were wrapped around Carlo. 

“I cast about for help. Again. 
My mother, who was alive men, 
told me that a friend of hers who 
worked at an UrNu receiving 
point had heard from her brother: 
Jonah Trap had delivered some 
goods to the city. The friend 
might be able to get a message 
through to him, if mother had one 
she wanted carried. ‘You’ve got 
one,’ I told Mama, ‘you’ve got a 
very special message you want 
carried.’ And so one day after 
class in the VanEd complex I took 
Emory over to Mama’s, and we 
all rode a transit-car to a lift- 
terminal as close to our friend’s 
receiving point as we could. We 
didn’t take anything with us, only 
ourselves, and that night we rode 
out of the city in the back of 
Jonah’s pickup truck, under a tarp 
since we were afraid there might 
be patrollers out.” She lapsed, 
suddenly, into plantation dialect 
and began to sing:

“A long, bumpy ride to the 
Phoenix Plantation, right here 
where we’re all sitting now.” 

She let Carlo down. The boy 
made a circle around us, touching 
the backs of our chairs and some- 
times putting his lips to the edge 
of the table. “A B C,” he said 
gruffly; “A B C.” 

“Nicer here than in a subterra- 
nean cubicle, ’ Mrs. Bitler said. 
“Isn’t it? Even if you happen to 
be a kidnapper.” 

The morning passed much too 
quickly for me. The two young 
women, Georgia and Casta, 
cooked on a wood stove that 
quickly heated up the kitchen. 
Indian Alex and I helped Jonah 
Trap’s daughter-in-law put the 
noon meal on the table, while 
Yates and Mrs. Bitler, two or 
three children tagging along, 
strolled through the scuppernong 
arbor and part of the peach or- 
chard. When they returned for 
dinner, Yates took me aside and 
said that they had talked about 
her late husband and her own de- 
sire to see the city again. “It 



shouldn’t be too hard for you to 
persuade her to come back with 
us,” he said. 

Trap and his two sons came in 
from the orchards to eat. More in- 
troductions. Gabriel and Michael, 
this is Mr. Yates, Mr. Guest, and 
Miz Noble. The kitchen was 
teeming with people, the 
linoleum floor sighed under us, 
additional wings on the table were 
folded into place and dishes dealt 
out like playing cards. Georgia 
took the kids into the back yard to 
eat on the lawn. 

Fried chicken, sliced tomatoes, 
fried okra, fresh cucumbers, fried 
fruit pies, cornbread, slabs of 
home-churned butter, well water 
cooled in the earth. Amid this 
abundance, silverware rattled and 
latters of food went from hand to 
and as if hovering on their own 
power. 

Looking at Guest, Trap said, 
“You I done met, Mistah Guest. 
These people yo’ frien’s?” He 
pointed his fork at Yates and me. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Well, they plenny welcome, 
then. Will you ax the blessin’, 
Casta?” 

Casta asked the blessing: it 
wasn’t an Ortho-Urban prayer, 
that’s the main thing I remember 
about it. Between mouthfuls of 
food, then, Jonah Trap got our 
business straightened out: we 
wanted to invite hi's cousin and 
Gerard Nettlinger to return to the 
Urban Nucleus, at least for a kind 
of commemorative visit. (I think I 
was the bright one who used the 
word “commemorative.”) Fiona 
Bitler said that Emory had been 
planning, for several years, to do 



48 



GALAXY 




just that; since returning from the 
Scandinavian Polity two weeks 
ago, he had moved this contem- 
plated visit to the top of his own 
personal time-table: he wanted a 
chance, in fact, to address a com- 
bined session of the Urban Coun- 
cil and the Conclave of Ward 
Representatives. 

“Good luck to you there,” Alex- 
ander Guest said. 

“We’re both enfranchised,” 
Mrs. Bitler said. “Or were. Be- 
sides, I’d think our returp would 
stir up enough interest to invite 
such a public address.” 

“A century ago,” I said, “the 
Japanese permitted a rescued 
hold-out in the South Pacific to 
speak to their parliament, almost 
thirty years after World War II.” 
Not one of my better-received 
analogies. Jonah, Michael and 
Gabriel, Casta, Newlyn and 
Alex — they all stopped chewing to 
look at me: Scarlet O’Hara, Ph.D. 
in Comparative History. 

“That's exactly right,” Fiona 
Bitler said. 

After dinner Trap and his sons 
returned to the orchards. The 
serving dishes on the table were 
covered with an embroidered 
cloth:' no more cooking that day. 
Guest and I, working in wash/dry 
landem, took care of the dirtied 
plates and silverware. But Emory 
Nettlinger was elsewhere, sleep- 
ing out the heat of the day, and 
the afternoon was much longer 
than the morning.

Mrs. Bitler countered the 
length of the afternoon a little by 
giving us a bedroom upstairs and 
urging us to take naps: “If you 
want to talk to Emory this eve- 
ning, you’d better get some sleep.” 
We had left our gear on the 
mansion’s porch, in the portico. 
We hauled it up the stairs to our 
bedroom (the middle one of three 
in relation to the stairwell) and 
stacked it on the floor between 
the room’s two brass beds. The 
beds had feather mattresses, 
though, and Alex refused to sleep 
on them, preotesting a weak back. 
He made a pallet beside our gear 
and lay down on that. For the 
first time since we had been in 
the house Newlyn removed the 



ALLEGIANCES

belt supporting his holster and let 
his constricted facial muscles 
relax; he put the hand laser under 
his pillow. Even though all the 
heat in the mansion had seemed 
to concentrate itself in this one 
room, we all managed to sleep. 
The floors were so rickety that 
Newlyn didn’t even feel com- 
pelled to set a “watch.” 

We met Emory Nettlinger him- 
self that evening — after the sup- 
per Newlyn wouldn’t let us go 
downstairs for. “One meal like 
that a day is enough,” he said, 
shaking his head almost jovially. 
“Feather mattresses and fried 
food, it’ll do you in.” 

Jovial or not, he wouldn’t let us 
go down — until he was sure the 
Traps had finished the evening 
meal. Then we clumped in our 
boots single-file down the stairs 
and, at Trap’s direction, met Mrs. 
Bitler and her former ward in 
caned lawn chairs under the 
“Master’s Oak.” It was almost 
twilight. 

Nettlinger stood to shake hands 
with us. He was a short man with 
allid skin, close-cropped blond 
air making a point in the middle 
of his forehead, and eyes like 
bluish ice. The veins in his tem- 
ples pulsed. ' 

“You want to take us back to 
the Urban Nucleus,” he said. 
“That’s fine, Mr. Yates. We’re 
almost ready — almost — to go.” 
“Will you come with s tomor- 
row?” Newlyn asked. 

“No. Tomorrow I’m not pre- 
pared to commit myself to. Nor 
would you and your people be 
rdy for us to leave with you.” 
“Why not? That’s what we 



came for.” 

“Sit down,” he said, and New- 
lyn and I took up lawn chairs; 
Alex, true to form, sat down on 
the f*rass. “To answer your ques- 
tion, ’ Nettlinger said, “you are 
ones who have been too long in 
city pent, and, like a great many 
other of the Urban Nucleus’ citi- 
zens, you’re going to require 
some. .what shall I call 
it? . .grooming? indoctrination? 
before you’ll be truly ready to ac- 
cept us.” 

“We’ve accepted you already,” 
I said. “And Mrs. Bitler will find 
that the city’s done a great deal to 
rectify the conditions her husband 
once complained of.” This was 
Newlyn’s line, I knew, but out 
here it seemed altogether true, 
not merely a part of the truth. 
Alex’s fears were exaggerated. 
— And I was supposed to De “per- 
suasive.” 

“Maybe you’ve accepted us,” 
Fiona Bitler said," looking at Net- 
tlinger, “but we don’t intend to 
come back to Atlanta alone.” 

“Trap’s family will be welcome, 
too,” Newlyn said. “It’ll have to 
be arranged, but I think — ” 

“Jonah doesn’t want to leave 
the Phoenix Plantation,” she 
countered. “We’re not speaking of 
them.” 

“Then who?” Alex said. “We 
s’posed to guess?” 

Nettlinger said, “Do you know 
where we’ve spent most of our 
time in the Open? Not here, cer- 
tainly. Not here.” 

“The Scandinavian Polity,” Alex 
said. 

“Eventually, eventually. I’ve 
just come from there, in fact. But 



50 



GALAXY 




when Fiona first took me out of 
the city, when I was a child, she 
arranged in Savannah to transport 
me to relatives of my father in 
Austria. That’s when we discov- 
ered that Austria per se didn’t 
exist anymore: the national units 
we supposed still intact had long 
since melded into the encompass- 
ing political entity of New Free 
Europe. 

“At any rate, I insisted that 
Fiona accompany me, and we 
sailed to the continent on a steam 
vessel someone had christened 
the Phoenix. It was named for one 
a man named John Stevens had 
built in 1808! A steam vessel, 
please note. Lately, we’ve 
traveled by air — since the Scan- 
dinavian Polity had aircraft which 
can compensate for the several in- 
adequate, coastal landing strips 
this ‘country’ still possesses — but 
we first left here on a steamship!” 

Nettlinger told us that he had 
acquired tutors through the inter- 
vention of a paternal uncle in 
Salzburg and that Fiona and these 
rotating tutors had taken him 
beyond the “kinetic relations” ses- 
sions and the “elementary” in- 
tegral calculus of the Van-Ed 
program in Atlanta into physics 
and higher mathematics: wave 
theory, relativistic studies, sub- 
atomic physics. 

“Oh, I gravitated to these 
studies naturally,” Nettlinger said, 
smiling at Mrs. Bitler. 

Moreover, he and Fiona had 
moved his schooling about: from 
Salzburg to Vienna, from Vienna 
to Munich, and, finally, when 
Nettlinger was sixteen, from 
Munich to Scandipol (formerly 



Kobenhaven), the designated ad- 
minstrative center of the Scan- 
dinavian Polity of New Free 
Europe. Here, his “schooling” 
ended, and he began work in a 
research-development institution, 
on aeronautical and space en- 
gineering projects that the Euro- 
eans, Eurasians, and Japanese 
ad jointly commandeered, by de- 
fault, from the abandoned NASA 
programs of the United States. 

“Actually,” he said, “ ‘com- 
mandeered’ is the wrong 
word, since what they had ap- 
propriated was neither hardware 
nor working plans but — this is 
very important — an attitude no 
longer countenanced in the Urban 
Nuclei because of the very nature 
of these cities, these nuclei-, it’s 
the eternal opposition of entropy 
and growth, perhaps even of au- 
tism and extroversion. ‘Nucleus’ 
says it all, Mr. Yates: Atlanta sees 
itself, as do all the other domed 
cities, as the center of its own 
very narrow and circumscribed 
universe. And we’re afraid that 
your own gracious. .acceptance 
of Fiona and me will not be 
shared by Atlanta’s authorities, 
primarily because of the argument 
we intend to bring with us. ’ 

“No,” Alex said. “They’re 
likelier to accept people than a 
argument. What is it?” 

“To tear down the domes and 
rejoin the community of men, 
which is also the community of 
life.” Legs crossed, hands folded, 
the man looked remarkably prig- 
gish: prim as a prufrock. Even so, 
his voice was free of supercilious- 
ness. 

Alex put a blade of grass be-

tween his teeth. “Doomed,” he 
said. “You really are doomed.” 

Mrs. Bitler said, “That’s' why 
Emory’s been telling you about 
the changes in Europe and about 
the course of his own education 
there. Since uou find this hard to 
accept, you know the urban au- 
thorities are going to require 
some time to become comfortable 
with the changes in the outer 
world.” 

“But they aren’t that startling,” 
I said. “Here they are: Europe’s 
become a single political unit, and 
Emory Nettlinger has studied ad- 
vanced sciences in three or four 
different cities.” The twilight had 
come together around us as if 
guilted out of sequined, navy-blue 
cloth; fireflies were winking on 
and off under the trees. Fireflies, 
stars, and mosquitoes. I slapped 
at my exposed arms and squinted 
at the silhouettes of those around 
me: Mrs. Bitler was rubbing her 
bare legs as if similarly pestered. 

“That’s true,” Nettlinger said, 
“but there’s more.” He suggested, 
though, that we go inside since 
the mosauitoes and the gathering 
dark made continuing on the lawn 
unpleasant. 

Trap’s sons, daughters-in-law, 
and grandchildren had all retired 
to bedrooms in the mansion’s 
west wing. In the foyer we found 
Trap himself preparing to go up- 
stairs to bed. 

“That owl there,” Trap said, 
pointing to Nettlinger as we came 
in, “got him a place to stay in that 
ole overseer cottage. Can’ stan’ no 
early-mornin’ scootin’ about. Do 
all his thinkin’ when the moon 

52 



shine.” 

“A clear case of lunacy,” Net- 
tlinger said. “Godnight, sir.” 

“Goodnight." Trap paused on 
the stairs. “Goodnight, evvy- 
body.” And went on up with the 
step of a considerably younger 
man. 

In the parlor across the hall 
from the video-playback “class- 
room,” Nettlinger resumed the 
process of our grooming. I felt 
even more removed from my own 
century than I had that morning 
in Irwinton. The parlor was il- 
luminated by wall-mounted gas 
lamps, and the quality of the 
light — shifting, intangible, touch- 
ed with the influence of lac- 
uered floors and voluted window 
rapes — made the impetus of 
Nettlinger’s words almost too 
choicely ironic for comfort. The 
setting was Victorian rather than 
ante bellum, and Nettlinger was 
our intent, thin-faced tour guide 
leading us into a future that had 
already been part of the Old 
World’s past. Legs crossed, hands 
folded, he sat in a chair that swal- 
lowed him. 

“Did you know that during the 
construction of the domes, shortly 
after the turn of this century, men 
walked on the moon again? Did 
any of you know that?” 

Newlyn’s face was tattooed with 
blue and purplish highlights; he 
leaned forward on the edge of the 
striped sofa, hands hanging. “I 
don’t believe that.” But he 
wanted to, you could read the de- 
sire in his posture. 

“No one in an Urban Nucleus 
has any reason to believe that,” 
Nettlinger said. “So why should 

GALAXY 




you? As a boy, I had no idea that 
such a thing could be. Fiona had 
never heard of a moon expedition 
beyond the American Apollo 17 
mission. If any enfranchised citi- 
zen of the domes knew that an 
Old World coalition had put men 
on the moon, he sat on the 
fact — smothered it beneath the 
wide, twin buttocks of urban pol- 
icy and patriotism. My own opin- 
ion is that no one knew, that no 
one in the city’s hierarchy would 
have cared very much even if the 
fact had been conclusively dem- 
onstrated. 

“The truth is, however, that 
continuously since 2023, two 
years before I was born, human 
beings have had a large and ex- 
panding base on the moon: a 
base, a colony, a shipyard, an 
observatory. .Enough. You 
must call it a city, I suppose: 
oddly enough, a domed one. 
How do you feel when I tell you 
these things?” His eyes stopped 
on me. 

Since Newlyn and Alex weren’t 
going to answer, I said, “That it’s 
too early for bedtime stories, is 
how I feel.” 

“OK,” he said enthusiastically, 
his accent now more European 
than American Southern. “Ex- 
pected. Anticipated. How else 
should you feel? But it’s the 
truth, and it’s part of the reason 
Fiona and I aren’t going trotting, 
trit-trot, trit-trot, into Atlanta to- 
morrow. The news is a shock, a 
jolt, it will undoubtedly throw a 
good many people and some of 
the UrNu authorities into confu- 
sion. And the note of dismay, or 
confusion, or even exhilaration. 



sounded by the broadcasting of 
this news — I must warn you — will 
only be the minor of that sounded 
by the rest of what I have to tell 
you. Do you understand me?” 

“We’ve gone to the planets?” 
Newlyn said: We’ve. He was 
transferring the accomplishments 
of New Free Europe into the 
hands of humanity in general. We 
came in peace for all mankind. 
(And womankind as well, Mr, 
Armstrong?) 

“Beyond,” Fiona Bitler said. 

“To what?” Alex said. “To 
what?” He looked as if he wanted 
out of doors again, whereas I was 
proving susceptible to Newlyn’s 
excitement: I found myself lean- 
ing forward, too. 

“When I arrived in Scandipol,” 
Nettlinger said, sidestepping, it 
seemed at first, Alex’s question, 
“they had been working on rel- 
ativistic and astrophysical con- 
cepts beyond those that had to do 
with the propulsion systems for 
earth-moon transport. Their com- 
patriots on the moon had, in fact, 
built a prototype of a vessel 
whose range would be interstellar 
rather than merely interplanetary. 

“Gravitation wells and as- 
trodynamics, metallurgy and 
stress mechanics; oh, it was a 
program drawing upon but other- 
wise divergent from the ones that 
had established us on the moon. 

“How to tell you? My mentor 
at the institute was Nils Caspers- 
son, and my own contributions 
were minor. Everything had gone 
forward extremely well before my 
arrival, I could only hone — by vir- 
tue of my virgin perspective, if 
nothing else — the insights Cas-

persson and his fellows had de- 
veloped over a period of three in- 
tensive decades. But I won’t be 
self-servingly modest: I did con- 
tribute, I did lend my own quirky 
insights to these researches. 
Emory Nettlinger, seventeen 
years old. 

“In 2043 our moon-orbiting 
prototype was given probe- 
capability and mechanically test- 
acfvanced a range of four light- 
years, nearly the distance of 
Alpha Centauri — although on this 
first unmanned ‘flight’ our direc- 
tioning was reluctantly, unavoid- 
ably random: a technological em- 
barrassment, I must grant you. 
But we retrieved the vessel; we 
called it back to our solar system 
and confirmed by its onboard 
equipment, photographic and 
chronometric as well as proto- 
astrogational, the very real fact of 
its advance. The surprise — the 
great, hoped-for surprise — was 
the coincidence of shipboard, 
subjective time and 

Scandipol/moon-base, subjective 
time: a round-trip of eight light- 
years in ninety-three Earth- 
standard days. Not the negation of 
Einsteinian physics, oh no, but a 
kind of ballet kick over the glass 
stage of interstellar space.” Net- 
tlinger uncrossed his legs, pointed 
his toes, and performed a funny, 
seated entrechat. 

“Caspersson, Fiona, and I got 
drunk, oh, we got magnificently 
stewed, we did, in the dead of an 
old Kobenhaven winter, snow sift- 
ing down outside like confetti 
from our friends on the moon. 
That’s how it was, wasn’t it, 
Fiona?” 

54 



“Like confetti,” she said. 

And I remembered Alex’s say- 
ing, Probably not for a ticker-tape 
parade. Right now he looked as 
unsettled, as uncomfortable, as I 
had ever seen him: a bear on a 
lumpy ottoman. But I was too 
happy for Newlyn to worry very 
much about Alex’s discomfort: 
Newlyn was a fourteen-year-old 
gawking about in the spaceship- 
cubicle of that old woman on 
Level 9, before Ardrey told him 
that it all had to be “flame- 
decontaminated.” 

Nettlinger got carried away, 
maybe just from looking at New- 
lyn, maybe from the simple joy 
he took in these recollections. He 
went on to tell us about the con- 
cept he and Caspersson called 
“light-probing,” and about its con- 
trolled implementation in a “fleet” 
of operable, manned vessels. “Six 
light-probe ships,” he said. “Why, 
that’s a fleet. Who could want 
more than that so soon? Who 
could afford a larger investment?” 
Planned, constructed, equipped, 
and manned, and all by 
Nettlinger’s twenty-fifth birthday, 
too. Then broadcast, according to 
itineraries computer-derived, to 
those stars within a hundred 
light-year range possessing the 
optimum likelihood of habitable 
planets. Four of the vessels, it 
seemed,' had returned and gone 
out again with new crews! 

“One way to our furthest 
target,” Nettlinger explained, 
using a word that had a numbing 
and familiar impersonality, “is 
only 7.2 years. The remaining two 
ships — if nothing hinders tnem- 
— ought to be back in our own 

GALAXY 




system before Christmas, perhaps 
slightly after the New Year at the 
very latest. All goes well.” 

“Oh, it’s a New Year already,” 
Newlyn said. “You got. to come 
back with us now, Mr. Net- 
tlinger,” then turning to the 
woman, “Mrs. Bitler: both of you. 
Hot damn, who’s gonna want a 
dome over their heads when you 
can tell ’em things like that? Hey, 
nobody’s gonna get apoplexy 
hearin that, nobody! It’s gonna 
wake up all them mummies 
sleepin’ in the Basement, is all: 
Thats what it’ll do!” For the first 
time since I had been around 
him, Newlyn was falling into the 
speech rhythems suggestive of his 
blackness. But that Hot damn: 
somewhere, some time, he had 
got that from me, Clio'Noble. 

“An’ maybe not,” Alex said 
from his footstool, his bulk almost 
shapeless in the pooled light next 
to the sofa. “I don’t see it jes’ that 
way, Mr. Yates.” 

“H ow do you see it then. 
Guest?” They were using each 
other’s names like weapons. 

“The only way I can, where I 
sit from. When General Og- 
lethorpe first landed in this state, 
to make a colony of it, you know, 
an Indian they called Long King 
came all the way from Coweta 
Town to see him. You know 
why?” 

Hell no,” Newlyn said. 
“What’s that got to do with any- 
thin’, with anythin’ at all?” He 
was shaking his head in exaspera- 
tion. 

“Wait a minute,” I said. "Let 
him tell it, OK?” 

“Please do,” Nettlinger said. 



“Arguments against us we proba- 
bly require more than blind en- 
thusiasm. To forearm ourselves, 
you see.” 

“All right,” Alex said. He 
looked up at the ceiling: the 
cracks and moisture stains fixed 
his attention. “Long King went to 
Oglethorpe to learn wisdom. He 
thought God had sent ole Og- 
lethorpe to teach the Indians 
since it was plain the English had 
more and knew more and must 
have been picked by Him to in- 
struct ’em. So they gave up some 
land in payment for the instruc- 
tion they was supposed to get. 
Later, the English got all the land 
and the only wisdom the Indians 
was left with was, You can’t trust 
the English. But it was too late, 
they was on reservations in Ok- 
lahoma keepin’ themselves warm 
with cholera.” Alex looked down. 

Everyone considered this, New- 
lyn annoyed that he couldn’t give 
vent to his excitement — which 
was still effervescing in his head 
and hand movements. Finally, 
Mrs. Bitler said, “I don’t think 
Emory’s saying we’re going to 
bring the population to the Urban 
Nucleus wisdom, or even ad- 
vanced technological knowledge, 
necessarily. The offer is really the 
chance to rejoin a larger commu- 
nity.” 

“Oglethorpe,” Alex said, “didn’t 
say he was bringing wisdom, 
either. The Indians jes’ looked at 
the English and supposed it, is 
all.” 

“The citizens of Atlanta,” New- 
lyn said, “aren’t going to suppose 
they’re inferior beings in need of 
instruction.” His speech was crisp

again. 

“Who said ‘inferior’?” Alex said. 
"Besides, you’re one citizen that’s 
supposin’ jes’ what Long King 
supposed when Oglethorpe got 
here. You’re an Indian hopin’ 
these people will take you back to 
England and show you off to the 
lords and ladies.” 

I chuckled, right out loud. And 
it was really me who had done it. 
Newlyn gave me his exasperated 
look, then said: “I think Guest’s 
opinion is an eccentric one. 

“A minority opinion,” I said, 
and Newlyn didn t know whether 
I was supporting him or subtly 
ridiculing him: I didn’t either. 

“Well,” Mrs. Bitler said, “ec- 
centric or not, it’s probably a view 
that will be held, with all sorts of 
variations, by enough people to 
make our hesitancy about going 
into the city the wisest course. 
You people may have to be our 
ambassadors, going ahead of us to 
pave our way. Because caution is 
called for, caution is required.” 
“Selah,” Emory said. “Selah to 
that.” 



VII 

the citizens of the 
urban nucleus considered as 
indignant desert birds 

At three in the morning we 
broke it off, Emory and Fiona tell- 
ing us that the best procedure 
would be for us to go back to the 
Urban Nucleus and explain to the 
authorities what we had heard at 
Phoenix Plantation. Jonah would 
serve as a go-between for later 



preparations, if these were 
needed. Inconclusive; all of it, in- 
conclusive. 

Alex wouldn’t sleep upstairs. 
He wouldn’t say why, but it 
pretty clearly had to do with the 
conflict between him and Newlyn. 
“That lawn looks plenty good 
enough,” he said when we were 
in our room. “Cooler than up 
here, too.” 

So I helped him carry his bed 
gear down the stairs (Fiona and 
Nettlinger were still in the parlor 
as we went by) and watched as he 
spread it out under the Master’s 
Oak, cane chairs around it like a 
breastwork fortification. Resem- 
bling the hard, sinister, bone under 
a face that has melted away, the 
moon had come up: full. I 
couldn’t see anything on it that 
might be the domed base of 
Nettlinger’s narrative. Just the 
moon, nothing more. 

“Sweet Cleopatra,” Alex said to 
me. 

“What about the mosquitoes?” I 
didn’t know why he’d said that, so 
I was heading him off. 

“What about them back there 
in the Kudzu? We made it, Cleo. 
I’m gonna make it out here to- 
night.” He kissed me on the 
forehead, father to daughter. Our 
feet almost entangled in his sleep- 
ing bag, surrounded by cane 
chairs, we stood there. “Kiss me 
again, Cleo?” Asking, not order- 
ing. 

“Why?” 

“Because Yates is gonna get 
more’n that, even.” 

It wasn’t insulting somehow, it 
wasn’t even self-pitying: only a 
statement of fact that I didn’t at

that moment believe in. I kissed 
Alex, putting my arms around the 
bulges above his waist, the ones 
my mother always called “love 
handles.” (My father had a pretty 
good set of them.) Then it was 
over. Alex sat down in one of the 
chairs and looked at the moon. 

“You know what I want more 
than anythin’ else in the world, 
Cleo?” He didn’t give me a 
chance to answer. “Enfranchise- 
ment,” he said. “That’s all I want, 
that’s why I do things like this 
one, come out here and all. One 
day — I keep thinkin’ — -.they’re 
gonna say to me, ‘OK, Mr. Guest, 
you can call yourself Menewa, 
and from now on you’re fully pro- 
tected by the Urban Charter. Jes’ 
write Menewa on this form here 
and drop it in the mail.’ That’s 
what I dream about, even actin’ 
as a agent between the city and 
all the Jonah Traps out here.” 

“Why?” I said. “What do you 
really owe the UrNu authorities? 
I don’t know why you must 
haven’t defected and stayed out 
here.” 

“I don’t either, Cleo. Cept that 
I’m waitin’ for my enfranchise- 
ment.” He looked at me in bewil- 
derment. “Ain’t that the damn- 
dest?” 

U Clio?” NEWLYN said from one 
of the brass beds. I closed the 
door, and he said, “Is Nettlinger 
still up?” 

“Talking with Mrs. Bitler,” I 
said. I couldn’t see Newlyn, he 
couldn’t see me: the room bound 
us together in an indivisible 
blackness and a summer heat that 
(he moon still hadn’t begun to 



siphon off. 

“I think they’re lovers,” New- 
lyn said. “Bodyburners.” 

“She’s twenty-five years older 
than he is,” I said, finding the 
bed opposite his. Did he really 
think Fiona Bitler was a modern- 
day Isis, both mother and consort 
to her own Nettlinger/Osiris? 

“How she look to you? De- 
crepit?” The blackness in the 
room had crept into his speech: 
city blackness, Bondville black- 
ness, even though Newlyn had 
never lived a day in one of those 
razed tenements. Under maybe, 
but only Level 1 or 2. 

“No. Hardly decrepit.” 
“Preserved,” Newlyn said. 
“What you got to call 
‘preserved.’ ” But I was else- 
where, light-probing through my 
own grey matter. “What’s wrong, 

chor 

“Guest. Alexander Guest.” 
“Look,” he said, turning so that 
the bed springs sighed and I 
could almost see his face resolving 
out of the darkness. “That man’s a 
case. All this Indian history, all 
his foreknowledge of what’s gonna 
happen if Nettlinger comes to At- 
lanta. And he claims to 
be. .what? a Creek Indian?” 
“Cherokee.” 

Newlyn was quiet a minute. “I 
know something about them, too, 
about the Cherokee. Indians and 
black men; co-holders of honors in 
this world’s dispossession stakes. 
But when the Cherokee got 
thown out of Georgia, Miz Noble, 
some of ’em was rich enough to 
take their nigger slaves on the 
Trail of Tears. I always remem- 
bered that, whatever else of 



ALLEGIANCES 



57 




school I long since forgot. So if 
those black people was cousins in 
sufferin’ to the Cherokee that 
dragged them along, they was 
cousins twice -removed. Did you 
know that, Miz Clio Noble?” 

“No,” I said. “Why are you so 
wrought up?” Our first quarrel, 
our first real quarrel. Start by 
using her first name but end up 
by spitting out the whole thing 
like a curse: almost flattering. 

Newlyn lay back, the mattress 
sighed, the bed springs clinked. I 
took off my boots and socks and 
just sat there with my feet on the 
hardwood floor. After a while, 
Newlyn said, “Come over here, 
Clio. Please.” It was seduction by 
ennui, not as I had imagined time 
and time again it would finally 
occur: loving violence and tender 
rapacity on both sides. I finished 
undressing, went over to 
Newlyn’s bed, and slid myself 
onto his naked, clammy body. 

Ain’t this the damndest? I was 
thinking as it all unrolled like film 
footage consisting of nothing but 
blank frames. Then, head on his 
chest as he slept, I wondered if I 
had committed a sin of passion or 
of fraud. To which circle would 
Dante, that old anal-retentive, 
consign me? 

After a half hour or so I got out 
of Newlyn’s bed, put on all my 
clothes but my foot gear, and lay 
down on the floor. Went to sleep 
there, too; went to sleep there as 
if I had been lovingly embalmed 
by the hot night. 

And woke up to the shrill, re- 
peating shouts of someone down- 
stairs, terrifyingly like war whoops 
from the ghosts of murdered red 



men: war whoops rising through 

( onah Trap’s house as if the pre- 
ude to a general massacre. 

“Yip yip yip!” the shouts came. 
“Yip yip!’ 

“Jesus,” Newlyn said, sitting up 
on his bed and swinging his legs 
to the floor. “What in Christ is 
that?” 

But he was naked, and, answer- 
ing him nothing. I went ahead of 
him to the door. I burst into the 
upstairs corridor to confront only 
darkness. No lamp anywhere, the 
hallway too tightly sealed for the 
spillings of moonlight. A commo- 
tion from the stiars, a creaking of 
the banister railing and successive 
hollow thumpings on the steps 
themselves. Continuing above 
these noises, the war whoops that 
had yanked us out of our sleep. 

Holding my heart, my every 
pulse beat, in the curl of my 
tongue, I edged down the hall and 
stopped on the very brink of the 
stairwell. A door was thrown open 
behind me, far enough away that 
I felt certain it was Jonah Trap, 
and not Newlyn, coming to pro- 
vide moral reinforcement. 

“Yip yip yip!” the shouts con- 
tinued to come. Then, suddenly, 
they mutated into coherent lan- 
guage: “Yates! Clio! Get the hell 
out of there! Get the hell up!” It 
was Alex, and his voice was as- 
cending through the foyer and the 
stairwell from the open door of 
the Phoenix mansion. Then he 
started the war whoops again, that 
strangled-sounding, banshee yip- 
ping. I couldn’t see Alex because 
of the shadow of an eclipsing 
shape on the steps. 

No: two shadows, two shapes. 



58 



GALAXY 




They changed position and 
seemed to retreat as if in response 
to my presence. When they did, I 
could see Alex silhouetted in the 
doorway, moonlight pouring its 
waxy, bone-hard glow across the 
parquetry, the chandelier spar- 
kling in a fitful run of tiny bursts. 
Then Jonah Trap was at my 
elbow, candle in hand. 

The shapes that had formerly 
blocked my view of Alex were not 
at the bottom of the stairs; they 
were edging toward the entrance 
to the parlor. Not stealthily: dip- 
lomatically. One of them lifted its 
head and stared at me for a mo- 
ment, as if trying to confirm a 
recognition. The other, its back to 
the first, looked guardedly toward 
the open doorway, where Alex 
had still not given up his hue- 
and-crying. 

Behind Trap and me, Newlyn 
came clumping down the hall in 
his boots, and there was move- 
ment in the third upstairs room, 
too. 

“It awright,” Trap said. “It aw- 
right, Miz Nobel, you jes’ go on 
back to bed. I take care of this 
now.” 

But I had already taken two or 
three steps down the stairwell, 
my weight on the lefthand banis- 
ter. The creature in the foyer had 
not let go of my face, nor had I 
released its: a physiognomy 

carved out of maple or mahogany, 
but flexible in spite of its rigid 
appearance. 

Lips that moved. Two parallel, 
vertical bridges separating the 
eyes and lips. Two brow-hooded 
eyes possessing large, hourglass- 
shaped pupils, one bulb of each 



horizontal pupil set to the front, 
the other Dulb curving away to 
the side as if to provide simul- 
taneous peripheral and frontal vis- 
ion. The eye structures them- 
selves looked like moist patches of 
canvas set into the wooden sock- 
ets of a primitive mask and glued 
there with a thin layer of muci- 
lage. All of this, every bit of it, 
hypnotizing and unreal. 

Guest, having seen people at 
the head of the stairwell, had fi- 
nally shut up. 

I took two more steps down the 
stairs. The other shape turned 
toward me. A face very similar to 
the first, perhaps taller from chin 
to crest. Each creature, behind its 
head, had a corona of bone or car- 
tilage that extended its height and 
gave it an out-of-time, out-of- 
place regality. What were they? 
What were they doing in the 
foyer of Jonah Trap’s house? 

“Clio!” Newlyn said. “Clio, stop 
right the hell where you are!” 

I looked back up the stairs. The 
number of lights there had prolif- 
erated, as had the number of 
people. Emory Nettlinger, wear- 
ing a dressing-gown so hastily 
knotted at the waist that Trap’s 
candle and his own lantern 
showed me Nettlinger’s thin, 
white legs, came jerking along the 
corridor and stopped above me on 
the landing. Fiona Bitler, carrying 
another lantern, came up behind 
the three men now standing 
there: her cousin, her lover, and 
Newlyn Yates, who was holding 
his hand laser trained on the 
shapes downstairs. 

Alex shouted up to us, “They 
come out of that overseer’s cot- 



ALLEGIANCES 



59 




tage! I saw ’em cross the lawn and 
come inside! When they started 
up the stairs, Yates, I started in to 
whoopin’!” 

“Thank you for that,” Net- 
tlinger said, sotto voce. 

“These are the ‘visitors’ he 
wants to bring into Atlanta! Alex 
shouted. “This is what we’re 
havin’ to get groomed for!” 

Somewhere in that huge house, 
a child had long since begun to 
cry. Without turning around, the 
two strange shapes below us re- 
treated deliberately into the dark- 
ness of the parlor. Then little 
Carlo came out of the classroom 
opposite the parlor and stood in 
the middle of the foyer, dwarfed 
by shadowy adults and incom- 
prehensible events, naked and 
bawling. I started down to him, 
but Fiona, setting her lantern 
down and descending quickly, 
swept past me and caught the boy 
up in her arms. Trap’s sons and 
daughters-in-law appeared in the 
entrance to the video-unit class- 
room, too, but Fiona, handing 
Carlo to Gabriel, turned them 
back. 

An empasse. No one moved. 

“We can’t take ’em into the 
Urban Nucleus!” Alex shouted, 
still from the doorway. He was 
afraid to come in, afraid of the 
things he had followed up the 
lawn to Trap’s mansion. “If w ; e 
do, Yates, I ain’ cornin’ with you! 
I’ll go on ahead and spile 
over’thin’ for you, I’ll tell em 
what Nettlinger’s plannin’, I 
swear I will!” 

Newlyn ignored all this; he 
looked at Nettlinger. “Starmen?” 

“Please, Mr. Yates, put your 



weapon back in your room. Let 
me go down to them, they didn’t 
know you were here anymore 
than you knew they were.” 

“It s not any wisdom I want to 
touch!” Alex was shouting. “It’s 
not any wisdom worth goin’ into 
bondage for!” 

Several other children were 
crying now. Mrs. Bitler slid the 
panel to, closing off the room that 
the families of Gabriel and 
Michael Trap had come through. 
This muffled the noises of their 
dismay and confusion. 

“They ain’ seen ’em befo’ 
either,” Jonah Trap said, his arm 
around my shoulders, and, al- 
though I had been steelily in con- 
trol to this point, I realized I was 
crying. “They jes’ like you and yo’ 
gen’lemen, Miz Noble. It take 
some time, is all; it jes’ take some 
time.” 

We were midway down the 
steps, and I could see the two 
creatures in the parlor as if they 
were lepers hovering inside the 
mouth of a cave, cerements for 
garments, muipmy-cloth unwind- 
ing from their arms — except that 
what I first saw as unwinding 
bandages were in reality the 
loose, ribbonlike extensions of 
their incredibly long forearms. 

“Yates, Yates!” Alex was shout- 
ing, Mrs. Bitler beside him now. 
“You’d do best to shoot ’em, 
you’d really do best to take ’em 
out now!” But Newlyn had put 
the weapon away (though he 
hadn’t retreated to our bedroom 
as Nettlinger had asked him to), 
and Fiona was trying to calm 
Alex, just as Jonah Trap was try- 
ing to comfort me. I don’t know 



60 



GALAXY 




why I was crying, I didn’t really 
feel in need of comforting: all I 
can suggest is that I was em- 
pathizing with Alex’s panicky 
premonition of ruin. 

“Can you believe this?’’ Newlyn 
said. He said it as if he believed it 
completely, as if he relished the 
spectacle of our astonishment, his 
own included. 

Jonah Trap turned me so that I 
had to come back up the stairs 
with him, but I kept casting back 
over my shoulder. I saw Fiona 
lead Alex back out onto the lawn 
and close the front door behind 
her. 

Nettlinger said, “Well, 
everybody’s been given a good 
jolt, our visitors as well as our- 
selves. Please, Mr. Yates, you and 
Clio, go back to your room.” He 
turned to Trap. “It’s your house, 
Jonah. Tell them that it’s an 
order, for their own sakes.” 

“No one get ordered here but 
chillun,” Jonah said. “But I 
suzges’ the same thin’, Miz 
Noble, I strongly sugges’ it.” 

Nettlinger went down the 
stairs, carrying his lantern. I 
wouldn’t turn back to our room 
until I saw him go into the parlor 
and caught one more glimpse of 
the “starmen” who had thrown 
the Phoenix mansion into a 
four-o’clock-a.m. uproar. Then the 
little blond man pulled the glass- 
paneled doors to the parlor shut 
and returned the gleaming foyer 
to cool normality: silence and 
emptiness. 

After Newlyn and I had gone 
back to our room, there were no 
more doors to be closed. Not 
physical ones, anyway. 



Jonah trap drove Alexander 
Guest and me back to Atlanta in a 
pickup truck built so long ago that 
its fenders and sideboards jounced 
about maddeningly. In the truck- 
bed, a load of peaches — since he 
had to make the trip, he said, 
might as well do some business, 
too. 

It was raining when we left, so 
we rode in the cab, not beneath a 
tarp in the back. West on High- 
way 57 to Irwinton we went, then 
right on U.S. 441 in order to 
make connection with Interstate 
20 . 

As we drove, I kept thinking of 
all the red flags — flags of warning, 
now — hanging on the green tem- 
ples along our route out from the 
transit-tunnel. Through the 
wiper-cleared semicircles on the 
truck’s windshield, we could see 
more vines rearing, Jittering in 
the thin, steamy rain. 

The rain finally stopped, and on 
the outskirts of Atlanta, late that 
evening, we saw the Northern 
Cross among the ragged, blown- 
away clouds. 

Newlyn had refused to come 
back with us. Before we left, he 
gave the hand laser to Alex and 
told him it was his. Not to me, 
but to Alex. And not to slight me, 
either, but maybe to bridge the 
chasm between Alex and him. 
Riding back to the Urban Nucleus 
in Trap’s pickup, the Indian 
retty well knew he wouldn’t 
ave a chance to use the weapon. 
That didn’t mean anything, 
though, that didn’t matter. After 
seeing all the burning constella- 
tions, we were absorbed into the 
city through a receiving point, 



ALLEGIANCES 



61 




Alex’s own, the one where he or- 
dinarily worked. Trap unloaded 
his peaches. 

So: one enfranchised team 
member had defected, the only 
unenfranchised team member had 
returned, and Clio Noble, full 
citizen, feeling an affinity for both 
these men and even for the vague- 
ly sphinx-headed creatures who 
had ultimately decided their al- 
legiances for them, came back 
into the city because — 

They debriefed us, Alex and 
me. And we told them the truth, 
all of it. Then I quit my position 
with the Human Development 
Commission, my position as a 
resources-reclamation specialist. 
This was last year. Since then, for 
resigning with no apparent or at 
least acceptable reason, they 
moved me out of my Level 3 
cubicle to one on Level 9. My 
parents have asked me to move 
back in with them, but I’m an 
adult now and have kept myself in 
enough earnies to subsist on by 
waiting tables in the Gas Light 
Tower plaza. Mama, bless her, is 
trying to get me a job clerking at 
Consolidated Rich’s. “Or maybe 
even modeling,” she says some- 
times; “if it weren’t for all those 
freckles. ...” 

I haven’t seen Alex, even 
though he’s supposed to live on 
Level 9 too, since our debriefing 
sessions at the end of last sum- 
mer: he has dissolved into the 



population as surely, as irrevoca- 
bly, as a chameleon into kudzu. I 
just hope he’s still alive some- 
where, preferably not in this city, 
and that he’s found some people 
who don’t think he’s crazy for 
wanting to be called Menewa. 

Not long ago the chairman of 
the joint Council/Conclave an- 
nounced that the widow of Carlo 
Bitler and her former student, 
Emory Coleman, would be re- 
turning to the Urban Nucleus 
from a long sojourn in Europe. 
The spirit of the announcement 
makes me think that no reprisals 
are planned; the councilmen and 
ward reps are touting it as some 
kind of coup. I just don’t know. 
At the same time, I hope Newlyn 
comes back with Fiona and Net- 
tlinger, though how safe his re- 
turn would be is hard to assess. 
He did defect, you know; for at 
least a year he renounced the 
city — and I’m living on Level 9 
for quitting my job, nothing more 
than that. 

What’s going to happen? Some- 
times I think about Nettlinger’s 
“starmen” and wonder if this 
great, mound-shaped tomb of ours 
is destined to be the cradle of a 
new community. I see their 
rough, masklike faces. 

And even though we still don’t 
understand each other, you me, 
or I you, I want you to answer me 
this: Are we now, all of us, living 
in Bethlehem? And, if so, in 
whose tax books must we enroll 
ourselves? ★

The idea first came up at a 
beer and bull session at Jesse 
Weston’s place. She and her hus- 
band, Ardee, had been down at 
the beach that afternoon, and 
Ardee had stuck his foot on a dis- 
carded pop top. He was sounding 
off at his usual length about 
where and when it had happened, 
how much it had hurt, how 
crowded the beach was, and 
wasn’t it awful how much garbage 
was strewn about. That’s the way 
he actually talked: ‘strewn 

about’. He’s an English lit. major. 
Jesse had been sitting there, her 
gray eyes wide, nodding occasion- 
ally, when she interupted him: 
“You know what would be 
funny?” She addressed us in gen- 
eral. Nobody responded. What 
Jesse had thought funny in the 
past had ranged from a five 
hundred pound granite facing- 



Don Trotter 



block left in the kneehole of 
Thorsen’s desk (“That way his 
feet’ll reach the floor.”) to arrang- 
ing for every phone in the lab to 
ring with a loud, juicy raspberry. 
That is to say, a very narrow and 
very practical range. Seeing she 
wasn’t going to proceed without a 
little prodding, I ventured: 

“Not another quarter-ton tomb- 
stone, I hope. My hernias still 
twinge when I think about it.’ 

She looked contemptuous. 
“That was trivial, and lacking in 
social significance. No, picture 
this: It’s a chilly day this De- 
cember. All the world, or at least 
the hardened space-freaks, are 
huddled around their TV sets. We 
see through the eyes of Marsman 
I, who just fifteen minutes before 
has first set tread upon the ocher 
sands of Barsoom.” (She pro- 
nounced it to rhyme with ‘Bar 
Boom’.) “Our eyes sweep the 
horizons of the Red Planet, then 
fix on a distant hill. Treads chum 
the crimson grit, propel us toward 
the summit. We reach the crest, 
and what confronts us on the 
other side?” 

“Beer cans!” 

“Miles of beer cans.” 

“Acres of pop top plants.” 

It was practically chorused. 
She’d telegraphed the punch line. 

She looked pleased. “That’s 
right. Wouldn’t it be perfect ?” 
She hugged her knees and grinned 
hugely at its absolute perfec- 
tion. 



Kim Sohn spoke up: “Better 
yet, if the whole place were 
paved over with black asphalt.” 

My turn: “Or even better, 
Marsman comes over the brow of 
the hill, and there’s a little white 
cardboard sign, on a wooden 
stake. He rolls over to it, and it 
says: ‘No Tresspassing, by order 
of the owner, A.M. Thorsen’.” 

“In that icky orange ink of his.” 
That was Stephie, my wife. 

“No, no, not a sign, a stone tab- 
let.” Kim’s wife, Lee. 

“Not a tablet, an engraved facing 
block.” That was mine and 
brought the house down. Perhaps 
I should explain that Professor 
Albert Michaelson Thorsen is 
“boss” to Jesse, Kim and me, and 
that his vanity is exceeded only 
by his shortness. There’s a sign on 
his door that says: ‘‘A. M. Thor- 
sen’. Someone years ago penciled 
in ‘A.IM.ighty’ Thorsen. He never 
erased it. 

Kim spoke thoughtfully: “You 
know, it might not be impossi- 
ble.” 

Me: “Kim, do you know what 
the freight charges on five 
hundred pounds over 60 million 
miles would be?” 

“Probably enough to recarpet 
the stadium. Twice. But you 
know that, besides monitoring 
Thorsen’s life-detection experi- 
ment with it, they’re using that 
gizmo of the Computer Science 
department’s to process Mars- 
man’s return signal into, among 



64 



GALAXY 




other things, real-time TV 
pictures.” That ‘gizmo’ was the 
third largest computer in exis- 
tance, and the biggest one that 
wouldn’t have found capitalism 
terribly confusing. ‘‘It might be 
possible to alter the output 
slightly. I know a guy over there 
who’d love to help out on this, if 
it’s possible.” Kim ‘knew a guy’ 
just about every useful place 
there was. 

“Call him, Kim, call him!” That 
was Jesse, looking about ten years 
old and as if she were having a 
tough time keeping from jumping 
up and down and clapping. 

We were all just mellow 
enough for it not to seem un- 
reasonable. Kim balanced his beer 
on top of a Vietnamese brass 
elephant, and went to use the 
phone. 

While he was gone, I began to 
have second thoughts. 

“You know, having his name 
come up like that on national TV 
would be pretty embarassing for 
him.” In spite of everything, all of 
us respected, and some of us even 
liked the little expletive. 

Jesse snorted. “The little ban- 
tam will bask in it.” 

Lee came to my aid. “I think 
Hank’s right, Jesse. Five minutes 
after Thorsen’s name appeared 
there’d be a couple of dozen re- 
porters badgering him. And 
they’d keep it up for weeks — you 
know how desperate for scandal 
they are.” 

MARSMAN MEETS THE ALMIGHTY 



Jesse wasn’t that easily de- 
feated. “Nuts, he’ll love it.” 

“And it probably wouldn’t do 
his academic reputation any good. 
You know how those things are, 
everybody’d think he’d done it 
himself for the publicity.” I was 
back on the attack again. 

“He probably would if he were 
to think of it.” 

My bright and beautiful bride 
had a suggestion. “Listen, how 
about if instead of something with 
Thorsen’s name on it, Thorsen 
himself is there, maybe standing 
shaking his head at your pitiful 
notions like Hank says he does. 
That way it’d be harder to trace 
who it was and there’d be no 
question of hurting his academic 
standing. ” 

“Well, that misses the beautiful 
symbolism, but you might be 
right about his academic reputa- 
tion. Thorsen would sacrifice his 
first-born daughter before that.” 

Ardee stuck in his oar. “You’re 
all aware that it would be purest 
vandalism if this scheme de- 
stroyed valuable data.” 

That sobered us a bit. No one 
had even considered that aspect 
of it. And it suggested something 
else to me. 

“And has anyone thought about 
what happens if we get caught? 
Tampering with a project as ex- 
pensive as this one is likely to 
rate more than a visit to the prin- 
cipal.” 

“But you’re not really going to 

65 




do it are you. Hank,” Stephie 
wanted to know. “I mean, its fun 
to think about, but God!” 

“I don’t know if I am or not, 
but I’m betting that if it’s possible 
Kim and Jesse are going to give it 
their damndest.” 

“You betcha,” Jesse confirmed. 
“I think Kim is looking on it as 
an interesting technical exercise.” 
Lee turned to face me. “He prob- 
ably hasn’t considered Thorsen or 
what happens if we get caught. ” 

“I notice you said ‘we’. You 
want in on this?” 

“Sure, if there’s anything 
three-quarters of an attorney can 
do. I think it would be funnier 
than Hell.” She swore badly, 
capitalizing the word. 

Kim returned from the phone 
in the kitchenette, recovered his 
beer from the elephant, thanked 
the beast, and sprawled out on 
the rug. 

Jesse practically assaulted him. 
“Well, come on — give!” 

“OK, the guy I know in Com- 
puter Science says that he thinks 
he can get us what we need to do 
it. He’s going to look into it and 
come over tomorrow.” 

“O frabjous day! Callooh! 
Callay!” Jesse exulted. 

“Indeed,” Kim said drily. 
“Before you get too carried 
away, Kim, have you thought 
about what this might do to the 
data from the TV experiment? 
And what happens if we get 
caught?” 



“Yes to both.” So much for Lee 
and Kim’s marriage. “All we’ve 
got to do is rig a subroutine that 
causes the output of the TV- 
processing program to include 
Thorsen’s facing block at some 
point. The Output is altered, but 
the input, the actual data, is un- 
affected, and they can clear things 
up afterwards.” 

I interupted to tell him about 
the replacement of the block with 
Thorsen himself. 

“Better yet. The Almighty on 
Mars.” He sipped beer. “As for 
getting caught, we can set up the 
subroutine to commit hara kiri af- 
ter its run. Poof! Up in a cloud 
of random numbers. I know that 
verges on mixed metaphor, 
Ardee. After the subroutine is 
gone, all that’s left is the tiny in- 
sertion in the main program that 
calls the subroutine in the right 
circumstances, and that contains 
no account numbers or anything 
else to implicate us directly. 

. .of course, suspicion is apt to 
be rather heavy.” 

“You’re not British are you, 
Kim?” 

He ignored me. “The only re- 
ally hard part, aside from getting 
the subroutine to give a pretty 
picture, is getting the passwords 
that let us make that tiny inser- 
tion in the main program. But 
Georgie thinks he may be able to 
get ahold of them for us; his 
father is associate chairman of the 
department.”

“Sounds almost foolproof,” 
commented Lee. “And I think 
Jesse’s right, Thorsen will love it, 
although it may be somewhat dif- 
ficult to tell at first.” 

I took a couple of large swal- 
lows of beer. “Yeah. .OK, let’s 
do it.” 

“Okay.” Jesse sounded sur- 
prised. She hadn’t thought there 
was anything to be decided. 

K.im’s tame computer whiz 
came to the lab the next morning. 
The kid looked about twelve, all 
pimples and stringy hair, and 
mostly he looked down at his 
shoes and mumbled, but he 
seemed taken with Kim, and he 
provided the passwords we 
needed. Those, the dust-covered 
time-sharing remote computer 
terminal in the comer of the lab, 
and the programming expertise 
Kim had picked up as a math 
major before switching to exobio- 
logy were all we needed. A couple 
of weeks later, Kim had the sub- 
routine written and was proudly 
displaying his work on the TV 
display of the terminal. 

“Oh, it’s beautiful, Kim.” Jesse 
was ecstatic. 

“It is, Kim,” I agreed. “It’s 
Thorsen right down to the ends of 
his pointy little mustache. And 
that’s his supercilious head shake 
too.” 

“It is pretty good, isn’t it.” He 
was really pleased with himself. 
“Of course, getting it to look like 



Thorsen was no real trick. The 
hard part was getting it to appear 
in the right place at the right 
time. For instance, I couldn’t just 
have him appear centered in the 
picture, that might have made 
him look as if he were floating in 
the air. And if he simply appeared 
at some preset time he might 
suddenly pop into existance in 
front of some feature of the land- 
scape. No, the way this works, 
the main program will report to 
the subroutine every hundred 
milliseconds. When the sub- 
routine has gotten reports in a se- 
quence that indicates that Mars- 
man is breasting a hill, then it 
triggers, and Thorsen comes into 
view as we crest the hill, then 
vanishes a few seconds 
later. .like that.” He pointed to 
the TV display where the sub- 
routine was running over and 
over, Thorsen appearing over the 
hill, shaking his head pityingly, 
then vanishing. 

“Doesn’t having the main pro- 
gram report to the subroutine re- 
quire more than a ‘tiny inser- 
tion’?” Jesse wanted to know. 

“Only marginally; and the iden- 
tifying information still self- 
destructs with the subroutine.” 

Jesse was grinning at the dis- 
play again. “It’s really perfect, just 
mimsy.” 

“Shouldn’t he be a little nobler 
about the brow?” a voice behind 
us wanted to know. A familiar 
voice. Thorsen’s voice. 



MARSMAN MEETS THE ALMIGHTY

Kim and I both froze. Jesse ral- 
lied to our aid: 

“Oh, good, Dr. Thorsen. Take 
a look at this. We’ve been think- 
ing of doing some promotional 
announcements for the educa- 
tional channel about Marsman. 
You know: ‘No telling what’ll turn 
up on Mars. Don’t miss 
Marsman.’ ” It was close enough 
to the truth that I cringed. 

“With my face?’’ 

“Well, naturally we needed 
someone distinctive looking — an 
ordinary face just wouldn’t do.” 

"I’m pleased to see such initia- 
tive, but you’d better leave that 
sort of thing to the TV experiment- 
ers. Our own experiment is far 
more significant; see what you can 
dream up for that.” 

He left looking unconvinced 
but thoughtful. Kim killed the 
display on the screen, and as far 
as any of us knew that was the 
end of that. 

Early the next morning Jesse 
stuck her head into the cubbyhole 
I used as an office. 

“Thorsen wants us in his office. 
He wants to play speculations 
again.” 

“What’s he doing here this time 
of day? Its only a little after 
eight.” 

“ ‘Ours not to reason why’ ”, 
she misquoted. 

Kim was already there, perched 
on a window sill, mountains in 



the background peaking over his 
shoulder. Thorsen sat with his 
feet up on the desk. Jesse sank - 
gracefully to sit cross-legged on 
the carpet. I flopped into the only 
chair. 

“All right, you’ve just been told 
that an animal about the size of a 
cat positively and for a fact exists 
on Mars. What’s it look like? 
Hank, you start.” 

He was always picking on me in 
these sessions. The last one, a 
couple of weeks before, he’d 
wanted to know what numbering 
system intelligent Jovans were 
likely to use. I’d held out for bi- 
nary, arguing that they’d most 
likely be built along the lines of 
fish, with bilateral symmetry. 
Everybody else held out for radial 
symmetry, like squids or octopus, 
and octal, decimal, or duodeci- 
mal. Apparently I was to be the 
goat again. 

“Well, to begin with, the re- 
sults from the Viking probes 
showed no lower order life, no 
plants, no smaller animals, no 
microorganisms.” 

“No detected microorganisms,” 
Thorsen in tempted. “You’re well 
aware that those experiments 
were neither conclusive nor in 
some cases even well conceived.” 

“No detected microorganisms,” 
I corrected myself. “Nonetheless 
the TV experiments showed 
nothing analogous, to terres- 
trial plants or animals, and without 
those to live on, and in fact a 



68 



GALAXY 




whole ecological base to have 
evolved out of, more complex, 
larger animals are extremely un- 
likely.” 

“Correct, and I’d have been ex- 
tremely perturbed had you failed 
to bring that up. However, you’ve 
been told that such an animal ex- 
ists even so. What does it look 
like?” 

“OK, say something on the 
order of a turtle. Low, close to 
the ground so the wind doesn’t 
bother it, hard integument so the 
sandstorms don’t scour it to 
death. Black or dark brown for 
camouflage from predators if there 
are any, and to absorb what little 
energy is available from the sun.” 

“Black will make it radiate bet- 
ter at night,” Kim put in. 

“Well, maybe it can change 
color then, but in the daytime it’ll 
be black.” 

“What about locomotion,” 
Thorsen wanted to know. 

“Well, I’d say legs, or some- 
thing very similar. Wings are ob- 
viously out, and sliding or gliding 
like a snake or snail wouldn’t 
work well in that fine grit. Maybe 
six or eight of them, with broad, 
paddle-shaped ends to dig in and 
anchor.” 

“Any other limbs, Jesse?” 
Somebody else’s turn now. 

“Yes, two of those paddle- 
shaped feet modified to scoop 
sand into its mouth.” She 
sounded certain. 

“Why?” 




“There are only three major 
sources of energy available to 
Myrtle: direct solar radiation, 
which is obviously inadequate, 
radioactive decay, of which there 
ain’t that much there to decay, 
and other life forms, our as-yet- 
to-be-detected microorganisms. I 
therefore conclude that she makes 
her living by filtering smaller or- 
ganisms out of the sand, like 
whales filter krill.” 

“You left one out,” said Thor- 
sen, and waited. Jesse looked 
puzzled. 

“The wind,” Kim helped out. 

“Oh, yeah, sure, but I can’t 
think of any likely way for an or- 
ganism to use that. I mean mar- 
tians with little windmills on top 
of their heads would never be 



MARSMAN MEETS THE ALMIGHTY 




able to reproduce. They’d be too 
busy laughing at each other.” She 
giggled, and rocked back onto her 
elbows. 

“I agree windmills are impracti- 
cal,” Kim said, “But how about a 
sessile organism with thousands of 
tendrils waving around in the 
breeze, sort of like a sea 
anemone?” 

“How does it get energy from 
that,” Thorsen wanted to know. 

“Say its got two kinds of ten- 
drils, one impregnated with 
natural lodestone, the other with 
some sort of conductor. The ten- 
drils are shaped so the flow 
around them is very turbulent, so 
when the wind blows over them 
they whip around and bingo, a 
natural generator.” 

“Lodestone isn’t that common 
even on Earth,” I put in to show 
I was listening. 

“Make him self-energizing 
then, like a powerhouse 
generator, that way it wouldn’t 
take much.” 

“It sounds pretty unlikely to 
me.” 

"Have you ever seen a hermit 
crab? Or a human being?” 

“Let’s hear some more about 
Hank’s turtle,” Thorsen ordered. 
“Head, sense organs, Jesse?” 

“I’d say a retractible cluster of 
sense organs. That sort of thing 
isn’t generally very durable. 
Probably something analagous to 
eyes, so Myrtle can stay in bright 
sunlight and avoid stepping into 



puddles. .of shadow, and a pair 
of antennae — feathery things, like 
a moth’s — for detecting breezes. 
Probably they’d be as far apart as 
possible when extended to give 
the most directional information. 
Hearing would be useless, of 
course.” 

“Anything else, Kim?. 
Hank?” 

“Well, it might be useful for it 
to be able to sense changes in at- 
mospheric pressure, and maybe to 
smell water or whatever it uses 
for a solvent, but those funccions 
could be in the antennae.” 

“OK. .anybody want to add 
anything else?” He waited a few 
seconds. “What you’ve come up 
with is substantially the same as 
the result of my own thoughts.” 
He fumbled around in the papers 
on his desk, then came up with a 
pencil drawing which he passed 
around. It showed a creature very 
similar to what we’d described. 

Thorsen had been staring out 
the windows while we examined 
his drawing. When I put it back 
on his desk, he spoke, still staring 
out the window: 

“It has come to my attention 
that some members of this group 
may have the capability to make 
alterations in the output of the 
television experiment on Mars- 
man I.” ‘Come to his attention’, 
indeed. I wondered how much 
he’d doped out for himself and 
how much he’d squeezed out of 
Ardee Weston. I was sure Ardee 



70 




was our weak link and sure Thor- 
sen knew it. He looked around at 
each of us in turn. 

“Possibly,” I admitted. Jesse 
glared at me. 

Thorsen looked back out the 
window again. “I wonder if any of 
you has fully comprehended the 
power you have at your disposal. 
Consider what the effect would be 
if rather than my humble self (!) 
the creature I have just shown 
you were to be ‘sighted’ on Mars 
by Marsman. Life on Mars! And 
not just some boring little bacteria 
only people like us care about, 
but something big enough to see 
and strange enough to excite. At 
the least, the very least (He was 
beginning to sound excited!) it 
would assure the launching of 
further Marsmen. And I think the 
odds are excellent that it would 
trigger completion of Ares and 
Stalin. The cold detente is just 
starting to heat up, and a joint 
manned Mars mission could be 
just the thing to fan the flames. 
But the citizens of neither country 
would pay for it without there 
being something up there to ex- 
cite their interest.” He had a 
strange look in his eyes, a dreamy 
look I had never seen before. All 
at once, I realized: I’ll be 
damned, the Almighty wants to be 
an astronaut. But if he could get 
the manned mission revived, he 
probably had a pretty good 
chance; he was about the top ex- 
obiologist in the country. A lot of 



other things fell into place too. All 
that jogging he did, for instance, 
and that biplane he was so fond of 
buzzing football games in. But he 
was still talking: 

“We’ve been tending to turn 
more and more inwards the last 
decade. There’s been little in 
space to capture the public’s imag- 
ination so appropriations have 
been waning. We must do some- 
thing like this to turn attention 
outwards or mankind will remain 
forever earthbound.” He realized 
he was getting uncharacteristically 
poetic, and turned toward Kim 
briskly. “Well, Kim? I think you 
are probably handling the nuts and 
bolts of this.” 

Kim looked at Jesse and me, 
then replied. “Sure, we can do it, 
but why not go all the way, have 
John Carter gallop up on a thoat?” 

“Don’t be ridiculous.” 

“The whole idea is ridiculous. 
Do you really think that if some- 
thing like this,” he brandished the 
drawing he’d picked up from the 
desk, “wanders across the land- 
scape the actual data from Mars- 
man won’t be checked and re- 
checked, processed and repro- 
cessed, trying to get every possible 
shred of detail? And that when it 
is, the hoax won’t be discovered, 
and the whole space research 
program totally discredited. Then 
watch your appropriations wane!” 
Kim was as angry as I’d ever seen 
him. 

“I’ye considered that with the 



MARSMAN MEETS THE ALMIGHTY 



71 




most extreme care, Kim, and I 
feel that the chances of our being 
found out are very small.” He 
grinned. “I had a few drinks with 
the chairman of the Computer 
Science department at the faculty 
club last night. Once the data 
from Marsman is in the computer, 
there’s literally nothing that can’t 
be done to it while its still in the 
computer. No one will ever ex- 
amine data of any sort except that 
provided by the computer. And 
consider human nature. The peo- 
ple running the TV experiment 
won’t doubt their own machine, 
expecially when its putting out 
exactly what they’d most hoped to 
see. No, Kim, I think we’re safe.” 

“But its criminal, deliberately 
falsifying data that way.” 

“In a moral sense, you’re right 
of course, and that point bothered 
me more than any other. Its 
against every principle I was 
taught and believe, but I think in 
this one case the advancement of 
science requires the violation of 
its principles.” 

“ ‘Violation’ is right,” Kim said. 

“Doc, just how badly do you 
want to go to Mars,” I asked. 

He looked surprised and a little 
angry. “Your perception amazes 
me. Hank, but if you’re implying 
that I’m advocating this merely 
because I want to go to Mars, 
you’re absolutely wrong. Even if I 
knew right now that the only ef- 
fect would be to cause the launch- 



ing of more Marsmen, I’d still 
want to follow this course.” 

“But you still haven’t answered 
my question.” 

“How badly do I want to go to 
Mars?” He looked embarassed 
and turned to stare out the win- 
dow again. “More than anything 
at all.” 

“Then I think we should do it.” 

“Me too,” Jesse echoed. 

It took us three more days, 
working in shifts, to convince Kim 
to help us. He put up moral ar- 
guments, ethical arguments, 
technical arguments, and practical 
arguments, but in the end, he 
yielded. 

And he did a beautiful job. It 
was 6 a.m. here, but a little be- 
fore noon (“Don’t want to have to 
worry about shadows.”) in Solis 
Lacus on the sixth day after 
Marsman landed. A' light sand- 
storm (“Or tracks.”) had come up 
earlier in the morning, and the 
duty engineer on Earth was alter- 
nately yawning and staring at the 
TV screen trying to decide 
whether to tell Marsman to go 
into resting mode until it passed. 
The screen showed the boulder 
field Marsman’s dog brain was 
guiding it thru. Suddenly out 
from behind one of the boulders 
churned Myrtle, all eight legs 
paddling sand for all they were 
worth, apparently flushed by 
Marsman. It almost immediately 
disappeared behind another boul- 
der, and was seen no more. 



72 



GALAXY 




Marsman hadn’t been program- 
med to go chasing after things, 
even things as interesting as that 
(oh, vain regrets!), so he took no 
notice, and by the time his mas- 
ters could get word to him to go 
back for another look no trace 
could be found. It was very con- 
vincing, and like I said, a beauti- 
ful job. 

Unfortunately it wasn’t enough. 
The papers the next day had 
‘Mars Turtle Found’ in four-inch 
type, all right, and a fuzzy photo 
of Myrtle, but the next day it was 
half-inch type on page four, and 
the day after that, interviews with 
scientists on page nineteen, and 
within a week it was forgotten by 
the public. No manned mission, 
no more Marsmen, no more 
money. 

Things were very gloomy 
around the lab after that. Thorsen 
tried to take it philosophically: 
“We just underestimated the 
public’s capacity for apathy. We 
didn’t capture their imaginations.” 

But four weeks later the Solis 
Lacus Plinth did. Jesse came tear- 
ing into the lab to get Kim and 
me, and we all ran down to 
Thorsen’s office. The bulletin was 
playing over and over on all the 
networks. A three meter cube of 
quartz, half drifted over with 
sand, once deeply carved, now 
worn almost smooth by the cease- 
less action of the wind and and 
sand over the weary eons. They’d 
moved Marsman up close, and 




you could see the sand and wind 
eddying around it, and the carv- 
ing, very faint, but almost, almost 
intelligible. The hackles on the 
back of my neck rose. Even Thor- 
sen was speechless. 

Funds for more Marsmen were 
voted almost that night, and con- 
struction resumed on Ares and 
Stalin the following morning. So 
Thorsen got what he wanted after 
all. He’s scheduled to land with 
the first group next month. 
They’re planning to set down in 
Solis Lacus, where Marsman I fi- 
nally conked out, near where the 
Plinth is supposed to be. 

But I wonder ...

FARTHER 

OUT 



THE VELIKOVSKY AFFAIR 



r or 25 years the startling cos- 
mological theories of Immanual 
Velikovsky have sparked debates 
that generate far more heat than 
light. Is he a misunderstood 
genius, persecuted by a Big Sci- 
ence Establishment unwilling to 
acknowledge the truth, or is he a 
crackpot trudging through the 
fever swamps of pseudoscience? 

“If he’s right, the rest of us are 
crazy,” said Harvard astronomer 
Harlow Shapley. “He has fear- 
lessly said that much of our con- 
ventional science is a bust and 
needs restructuring. Most of us 
have known this for a long time,” 
says Fred Jueneman, science writ- 
er and Velikovsky supporter. 

The Velikovsky Movement chal- 
lenges not only astronomy and ar- 
cheology, but the whole structure 
of science. It’s not surprising that 
emotions run high, and discus- 



sions of Velikovsky tend to be de- 
bates in which each side scores 
points off the other. There’s little 
serious examination of Veli- 
kovsky’s theories and evidence. 

It is easy to see how this hap- 
pened. Big Science not only 
treated Velikovsky as a crackpot 
from the beginning, but violated 
its own canons of ethics and fair 
play in doing it. The whole sad 
story was told in the American 
Behavioral Scientist ten years ago, 
and is available in De Grazia’s 
book, The Velikovsky Affair (New 
York: University Books, 1968). 

The scientific community 
should be, and much of it is, 
ashamed of itself. Not only was 
Velikovsky’s best seller — a trade 
book, not a textbook — hounded 
out of the MacMillan Company by 
massive attacks of academicians on 



74 



GALAXY 




MacMillan’s textbooks, it was also 
pursued even after the book was 
transferred to Doubleday which 
has no textbook department. 

“Reviews” of Velikovsky ap- 
peared in which the “scientist” 
reviewer proudly stated that 
he/she had not read Velikovsky 
and never would. Cecilia Payne- 
Gaposhkin, a colleague of 
Shapley’s, published a paper 
which misquoted Velikovsky and 
demolished the misinformation in 
the misquotes. It would be easy 
to fill this column with horror 
stories; for my purposes it’s suffi- 
cient to show that Big Science has 
something to be ashamed of. 

If Velikovsky is just another 
crackpot, those involved can claim 
that although the tactics were 
wrong, no real harm was done. 
However — if he has a core of 
truth in his publications! If he 
should have been taken seriously! 
Then indeed is there grounds for 
massive guilt feelings. To avoid 
guilt, refutation of Velikovsky is 
not enough. It must be shown 
that he was never worthy of seri- 
ous attention. 

I think this is why many scien- 
tists are not merely academic op- 
ponents, but actual enemies of 
this Russian-born psychiatrist. It 
explains why an entire day session 
of the AAAS could be devoted, 
not to looking at Velikovsky ’s 
theories for their merit, but 
rather to taking various state- 
ments of his and picking them 



apart. It may be why there was so 
much gleeful sarcasm expended 
on refuting casual remarks in no 
way central to Velikovsky’s 
hypotheses. 

Unfortunately for Velikovsky 
and his supporters, it is easy to 
score points off him. Some of his 
claims are so absurd that his most 
ardent supporters don’t want to 
discuss them. Moreover, Vel- 
ikovsky is guilty of both academic 
showmanship and sloppy scholar- 
ship. He can’t help making spec- 
tacular claims that are totally ir- 
relevent to his theories. He often 
quotes out of context. He does 
not evaluate his sources, and he 
seldom discusses evidence against 
his theories. 

I’m sure this last paragraph will 
infuriate the Velikovskians as 
thoroughly as the opening para- 
graphs have inflamed his enemies. 
It would be unfair simply to make 
my charges and not give in- 
stances, but for continuity I will 
postpone examination of 
Velikovsky’s rather strange scho- 
larly tactics and procede im- 
mediately to my main thesis.* 

I think both sides have lost 
sight of the major point of the de- 
bate. In my judgment, Velikovsky 



*In the interests of fairness, and with 
Jens s concurrence, I hereby invite Dr. 
Velikovsky (at standard Galaxy rates and a 
maximum length of 7,000 words) to ad- 
dress himself to any or all of the issues 
raised in Dr. Pournelle’s column. 

— BAEN 



75 




has raised important questions 
that 'the Science Establishment 
should deal with. At the same 
time, his tactics and those of his 
followers make it difficult to have 
the impartial discussion he and 
they claim to want so badly. 

!MoST DISCUSSIONS OF VEL- 
IKOVSKY begin with a summary of 
his theories, invariably stating 
that his thesis is that sometime 
prior to 1500 BC the planet 
Venus, previously unknown in the 
solar system, erupted as a 
“comet” from Jupiter; that Venus 
narrowly missed striking Earth 
about -1500, and again 52 years 
later; and that some time after 
that Earth had one or more near 
encounters with Mars. 

Although Velikovsky does say 
all this, it is not his basic thesis. 
Actually, Velikovsky’s theories 
begin with his evidence for cata- 
clysms in the immediate pre- 
historical times of Western, and 
world, civilization. His entire 
cosmology rests on the catas- 
trophe hypothesis, and most of his 
evidence is mythological, legend- 
ary, and archeological. If it can 
be shown that there were wide- 
spread catastrophies in the period 
2000 BC to 700 BC, then Vel- 
ikovsky deserves well of the schol- 
arly world, no matter what the 
fate of his cosmological theories. 

After all , his cosmic billiards 
game is no more than his sug- 
gested mechanism whereby such 



catastrophies might have taken 
place. He is convinced that no 
other mechanism could account 
for what he believes were key 
events in man’s histoiy. Whether 
he is right or wrong about the 
cosmological mechanism, the 
catastrophies are his primary 
hypothesis, and the evidence for 
them is his primary data. 

It is this evidence which the 
scholarly community ought to ex- 
amine with care. If there were no 
catastrophies, his cosmology is 
simply irrelevent. If there were, 
it is up to those who reject his 
cosmology to come up with alter- 
nate explanations for these events; 
and Velikovsky will deserve the 
credit for bringing our pre-history 
to light. 

Therefore, I propose to take 
Velikovsky seriously and examine 
his evidence for catastrophies. I 
also intend to raise several well- 
known facts that Velikovsky has 
ignored in his account of the 
life and times of the Bronze Age. 

Velikovsky states that much of 
his cosmic thesis comes from the 
Bible, and close reading of his 
books shows that he believes that 
the Bible is a real account of real 
history. For example, he points 
out that the Bible frequently re- 
fers to the Amalekites as very im- 
portant people, yet history knows 
them only as desert robbers. 

He is in good company in 
pointing this out; the Hittite Em- 



76 



GALAXY 




pire was discovered partly from 
the Biblical references to Hittites 
as a great Empire; for a hundred 
years archeologists thought of the 
Hittites as unimportant. Could 
the Biblical references be a key to 
unknown events in Near East 
pre-history? 

In order to bring the Bible into 
correspondence with Egyptian 
history, though, Velikovsky has 
had to compile an entirely new 
Bronze Age Chronology. In doing 
so he once again places himself in 
a position in which if he’s right, 
the other experts are crazy. 

In defense of his chronology, 
Velikovsky has written a persua- 
sive essay attacking the basis for 
traditional chronologies. He 
points out that most archeologists, 
not being chronologists, simply 
accept the “standard” chronology 
of Egypt and key their data to 
that; but the Egyptologists’ 
chronology rests on far shakier 
data than its proponents believe. 
So far so good: and I for one wish 
I could find a good undergraduate 
level text on chronology, because 
my research has turned up only 
rather obscure articles that don’t 
convince me. 

However, to say that the tradi- 
tional chronologies rest on less 
data than is generally supposed, 
and that there are nightmarish 
contradictions involved in accept- 
ing them, is not to say that 
Velikovsky’s own scheme is cor- 
rect. Velikovsky has not made 



minor adjustments in Egyptian 
chronology: he has thrown out 
about 500 years of what Egyp- 
tologists think of as history. 

Because of this it is difficult to 
deal fairly with Velikovsky. One 
cannot simply show that there was 
no world-wide catastrophe at 
some date that Velikovsky says 
there was one, because he does 
not accept the usual dating 
scheme. His cosmology and his 
chronology fit together like a fine 
watch must be dealt with as one. 

Furthermore, his books suffer 
from his style. He is often ob- 
scure, generally inteiprets every- 
thing in the most sensational light 
possible, and sometimes is inter- 
nally inconsistent; financially his 
methods have served him well 
but as a scholar he is his own 
worst enemy. 

It’s hard to take him seriously. 
One has a strong temptation to 
throw his book across the room 
because it is so easy to pick out 
some outrageous statement and 
refute it out of hand. One must 
continually try to decide just how 
crucial a particular enormity is to 
his theories. 

One must also ignore his in- 
furiating habit of documenting the 
well-known while providing either 
no reference at all, or an unreli- 
able source, for some of his most 
startling assertions. Finally, Vel- 
ikovsky never mentions some 
quite well-known facts that seem 
to contradict his theories. I’ll give 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



77 




examples of this later. 

For all that, though, let’s look 
at the evidence for catastrophe in 
the Bronze Age. 

Velikovsky begins well; in his 
first two controversies I agree 
with his position. First, he at- 
tempts to supplement archeologi- 
cal finds with myth and legend. 
Therein lies a sad story: ar-. 
cheologists and historians seldom 
work together. There is a power- 
ful archeological school that con- 
demns any attempt to blend the 
testimony of the spade with 
legend and myth, and reputations 
of highly esteemed archeologists 
have suffered when they tried to 
link their potsherds to legend. 

In my judgment this is a 
shame, and if Velikovsky can get 
historians and archeologists to talk 
to each other — even if only to re- 
fute him — he will have done, both 
a favor. 

Velikovsky also relies on the 
Bible, and is immediately em- 
broiled in a curiously vicious schol- 
arly war. Historians who are per- 
fectly willing to build whole gen- 
erations of XVth Century BC his- 
tory on “Manetho” will reject the 
Bible on the grounds that it was 
written much later than the 
events it describes by priests who 
wanted to prove certain points. 
Yet Manetho was a 3rd Century 
BC priest who wanted to please 
his Greek masters, a sort of Egyp- 



tian Geoffrey of Monmouth — and 
his works have not even survived. 
What we know of Manetho comes 
from those who quoted him much 
later. Could it be that scholars, 
having once been unable to pub- 
lish anything contradictory to the 
Bible, now have a tendency, in 
reaction, to reject everything it 
says? 

But Velikovsky takes the Bible 
as history, and his view seems to 
gain strength as new archeological 
finds are made; and of course he 
is not alone in presuming that 
myth and legend contain a central 
core of historical truth. 

I first became interested in Vel- 
ikovsky because of his assertion 
that Plato had “one too many 
zeros” in his dating of the Atlantis 
legend. Plato says that Atlantis 
fell 9000 years before his own era. 
Velikovsky makes that 900. 

Martin Gardiner in his Fads 
and Fallacies in the Name of Sci- 
ence ridicules Velikovsky for 
dropping the zero, and years later 
Isaac Asimov’s “Minds in Confu- 
sion” echoed Gardiner with no 
better evidence. Yet it is very 
likely that Velikovsky was correct 
here; certainly his view has sup- 
port from well-regarded scholars. 

In 1939, Spyridon Marinatos, 
then Ephor of the Cyclades, 
theorized that Minoan civilization 
may have been destroyed by a 
cataclysmic eruption of Thera, a 
volcanic island 60 miles south of 
Cnossus. That eruption can be 



78 



GALAXY 




dated by archeology, radiocarbon 
technique, and vulcanology to 
about 1450 BC or perhaps a few 
years earlier — ie, 900 years before 
Plato. 

The eruption was singularly vio- 
lent, from four to ten times as 
powerful as Krakatoa. It was the 
most powerful explosion in known 
human history, with a force of 
more than 70 megatons. 

The identification of Atlantis 
and Minoan Crete had been ar- 
gued by reputable scholars from 
1910 on, and in 1950 Marinatos 
explicitly discusses Crete’s fall as 
the basis of the Atlantis Legend. 
This proved to be a mistake: not 
the identification, which has come 
to be widely accepted, but discuss- 
ing it Marinatos has suffered 
from the charge of “sen- 
sationalism” ever since. I spent a 
day with him last summer and al- 
though he was charming and help- 
ful, he simply will not discuss At- 
lantis at all. In 1950, however, he 
did. 

Velikovsky must be familiar 
with Marinatos’ work, and I am 
aghast when Velikovsky’s support- 
ers in Pensee claim that their idol 
“introduced” the dating of Atlantis 
to 900 rather than 9000 years be- 
fore Plato. However, he certainly 
can rightly claim to have been 
among the first to recognize the 
importance of the Thera disaster 
and it was his handling of 
mythological data which led him 
to give it the correct date.

He can likewise claim to be 
among the first to accept the now 
widely held view that if there is 
an historical basis for the Atlantis 
legend, the fall of Minoan Crete 
in about -1450 was the event that 
inspired it. It should be noted 
that the conditional is widely ac- 
cepted, but many archeologists 
doubt there was any historical 
basis for the Atlantis Legend at 
all. I’ll add my view: Atlantis was 
real and Crete was it. 

Now Velikovsky claims to be 
able to show that the Thera disas- 
ter was only the Mediterranean 
aspect of a global catastrophe. He 
must claim that: the Thera cata- 
strophe is well documented and 
forms the major part of his evi- 
dence for disasters having taken 
place at that time. 

He marshals an impressive 
amount of evidence for universal 
destruction at the time of the 
Thera eruption. He not only 
quotes myth and legend from 
China and Central America, but 
eminent French archeologists 
working in Mesopotamia. Unfor- 
tunately, I am not competent to 
evaluate his claims — and I cannot 
simply take them on faith because 
of his “scholarship.” 

Velikovsky nowhere discusses 
the evidence against his view of 
Thera. There’s an impressive 
amount of it, but as far as all of 
his works are concerned it might 
as well not exist. He has to be 
familiar with the evidence; he 



quotes' from the same documents 
that contain it. But he ignores it 
completely, and in fact at the 
AAAS meeting in San Francisco 
last spring, asserted that he does 
not have to change a single sen- 
tence of any of his books — even 
after 25 years. 

In the rest of this column I will 
show why I for one use 
Velikovsky’s books as an interest- 
ing compendium of legends, but 
do not consider them serious 
scholarship. I intend to bring up 
archeological facts that Velikovsky 
must be aware of, but which he 
has never mentioned, and which I 
believe establish that the Thera 
eruption, although locally devas- 
tating, was not a world-wide 
catastrophe. 

By Velikovsky’s own admission, 
if the 1500 BC events were not a 
universal catastrophe, he has no 
case. It is inconceivable that 
Venus narrowly missed Earth and 
yet did not affect the entire 
Mediterranean basin, if not the 
whole world. The day the sun 
stood still must have been devas- 
tating for everyone. If it was only 
catastrophe for those near Thera, 
there can be no case for the near 
miss by Venus. 

First. Velikovsky’s revised 
chronology is not peripheral to his 
cosmology. He has revised the 
whole of Bronze Age chronology 
because he must. In particular, he 
must place the XVIII Dynasty 



80 



GALAXY 




of Egypt well into the First 
Millenium BC, and not at 1450 BC 
where everyone else puts it. 

The reason for this is that we 
have very good records of the 
XVIII Dynasty. It was the most 
glorious period of ancient Egypt. 
It begins with Ahmose, who ex- 
pelled the Hyksos (even Vel- 
ikovsky admits that, and the order 
of pharoahs in the Dynasty; what 
he disputes is when they lived.) It 
includes Thuthmose I, Queen 
Hatshepsut of the Punt Expedi- 
tion, Thuthmose III the Great, 
and continues into decline with 
Ahkhenaton the monotheist here- 
tic. The XVIII is a nearly un- 
broken record of achievement, 
and there is little room for disas- 
ters within it. 

Now if the Thera disaster took 
place in XVIII Dynasty, it had to 
be local, not universal. There are 
a few serious scholars who think 
the Thera explosion might have 
affected part of the Egyptian 
Delta, bringing darkness at noon, 
lightning, rains of red dust to 
produce rivers of blood, etc., and 
thus form the background for the 
Exodus; but no one contends that 
it was more than a local event in 
one province, and the “pharoah” 
referred to in the Bible must have 
been a local official. 

Actually, most archeologists and 
Egyptologists think even this 
much is poppycock, and I must 
admit that although I would like 
to believe it for dramatic pur-

poses, it is unlikely. How could 
the Exodus take place during 
Egypt’s period of expansionistic 
glory? For precisely this reason 
Velikovsky has redated the XVIII 
Dynasty to about 900 BC, con- 
temporary with David and Sol- 
omon. 

Anyone who has visited the Na- 
tional Museum at Athens, and the 
dig at Cnossus in Crete, and the 
Minoan museum at Iraklion — and 
I have only recently returned 
from there — must be convinced 
that the Thera eruption took place 
in the period called Late Minoan 
I. The date of LM I may be in 
doubt, but not that the city 
Marinatos is excavating at Akrotira 
on the island of Thera was an LM 
I culture. 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



81 




Now in the tomb of Rekhmire, 
an Egyptian Vizier and Foreign 
Minister, there are paintings of 
Cretans carrying tribute 
offerings — and those offerings are 
from the LM I period. They are 
typical: a bull-head rhyton, and a 
collared rhyton — both easily rec- 
ognizable as uniquely LM I. 

Rekhmire was definitely an 
XVIII Dynasty official, so that 
whatever the date of XVIII 
Dynasty, it must correspond to 
LM I period on Crete. Even Vel- 
ikovsky admits this. 

And there we have the con- 
tradiction; if the Thera eruption 
was in LM I it must have been in 
900 BC by Velikovsky’s chronol- 
ogy, and thus cannot serve as evi- 
dence for his -1450 disaster. But 
of course we can establish that the 
Thera eruption was in -1450, and 
in fact it was Velikovsky’s recogni- 
tion of this at a time when most 
archeologists underestimated its 
importance that first attracted me 
to Velikovsky’s work. The date of 
the eruption is established by 
stratigraphy, radio-carbon, and 
vulcanology, and is not seriously 
in doubt. 

The only one who disputes the 
date is Pomerance of the Ar- 
cheological Institute of America, 
and Dr. Pomerance wants it in 
1200 to account for the so-called 
Dark Ages of Greece. Even if he 
were right it would be no use to 
Velikovsky, who must place LM I 
in -900; and besides, Velikovsky 



doesn’t believe in the Dark Ages 
to begin with. And Pomerance is 
absolutely alone in his dating. 
Everyone else agrees that the 
eruption was no later than 1400 
BC. 

Second. Velikovsky quotes 
Manetho extensively in his books, 
and although he argues strongly 
against some parts of his history, 
he is not ashamed to use Manetho 
as an authority when he is 
needed. Velikovsky also uses the 
Greek legend of the Deucalion 
Flood as evidence for a cata- 
strophe, and he very definitely 
dates the Deucalion Flood at 
about 1450 BC. 

Manetho quite clearly states 
that the Deucalion Flood took 
place in the XVIII Dynasty, but 
you won’t learn that from Vel- 
ikovsky. 

Next. In Earth in Upheaval 
Velikovsky reprints a speech 
made in October 1953. In that 
speech he claimed that Linear B, 
a language of the time of LM I, 
would prove to be Greek. There 
is then a long footnote in the book 
pointing out that in November 
1953, a month after Velikovsky’s 
prediction, Michael Ventris first 
announced his decipherment of 
Linear B, and lo and behold it 
was Greek. 

This claim to a correct “predic- 
tion” is false. In 1951 Ventris sent 
copies of his decipherment to 
leading archeologists. By 1952 his 
claim was the talk of the profes- 



82 



GALAXY 




sion. In summer, 1952, there was 
a key find, a tablet decipherable 
using Ventris’ system, but which 
Ventris had never seen. This con- 
firmed Ventris’ theory, and by 
January of 1953 virtually everyone 
in archeology believed Linear B 
“would prove to be Greek.” A few 
diehards held out for ten more 
years, but they were a small 
minority. 

So, of course by October 1953 
there was no great expertise in- 
volved in identifying Linear B. 
Velikovsky discusses Linear B in 
books published before 1952, but 
in none of them does he even 
hazard a guess that it is Greek; it 
was not until the answer was 
known that he “predicted” it. 

Unfortunately those Linear B 
tablets give him real problems. 
Velikovsky must place Linear B in 
about -700, because the largest 
find was in the Palace of Nestor at 
Pylos, and Velikovsky has the Tro- 
jan War in about 700 BC rather 
than -1250 when everyone else 
thinks it took place. (The tradi- 
tional date is -1194, and it is still 
accepted by some authorities.) 
Also, Linear B is contemporary 
with the LM I pottery on Crete, 
although it survived on the main- 
land until much later. 

But Linear B is contemporary 
with the Thera disaster which Vel- 
ikovsky himself dates to -1500. 
There are several new finds that 
definitely make Linear B slightly 
predate the Thera eruption, so if 



Velikovsky’s chronology is right, 
his disaster date is wrong, and his 
position is endangered; and vice- 
versa. 

Next. Velikovsky must prove 
the Thera eruption to be a uni- 
versal disaster. It’s the heart of his 
position. But the eruption took 
place in LM I, and LM I is found 
in Mycenaean cities on the main- 
land, so that Minoan and 
Mycenaean civilizations can be 
synchronized. Mycenae experi- 
enced rapid growth of power and 
wealth following the end of LM I. 
This is precisely what one would 
expect if a local catastrophe re- 
moved the Minoans from the 
Aegean so that the Mycenaeans 
could inherit their trading em- 
pire. It is not what one would ex- 
pect to follow universal cata- 
strophe. 

Needless to say, you will find 
none of these facts in Velikovsky’s 
books or his more recent publica- 
tions in Pensee. 

In other words, both Velikovsky 
and his critics have suppressed 
evidence and indulged in other 
academic mau-mau tactics. 
Neither has played fair with the 
disinterested student. Now I wish 
I could simply dismiss Velikovsky 
as dead wrong at the heart of his 
theory and get on with my book 
on Atlantis. 

(Well, of course; why else would I 
know so much about the Bronze 
Age Aegean? And remember, you 
saw the identification of Thera with 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



83 




Atlantis in this column when Willy 
Ley was writing it.) 



Unfortunately, I can’t simply 
dismiss Velikovsky, because there 
do remain maddening discrepan- 
cies in chronology, and some of 
them were predicted by Vel- 
ikovsky. He has correctly pre- 
dicted that radio-carbon dating 
would show that certain artifacts 
of both the XVIII Dynasty and 
Pre-Columbian Central America 
would prove to be younger than 
expected. 

I don’t have to accept cosmic 
billiards to use Velikovsky’s eclec- 
tic studies of legend. I just have 
to be careful, because Velikovsky 
quotes Ginzberg’s fairy tales of 
Jewish legend and Jane Harrison’s 
excellent studies as if they were 
comparably reliable sources. 

I do think there are some prob- 
lems with chronology, although I 
doubt I need a cometary Venus to 
account for them. I do think some 
of the legends Velikovsky has 
painstakingly studied may embody 
real historical truths, possibly 
even of widespread cataclysms. 

In fact, I have a wild guess 
— and it is no more than that 
— about a very large meteor strike 
in the Mediterranean around 1200 
BC giving rise to the Phaeton 
legend. It might account for the 
very sudden decline of popula- 
tions and culture, the loss of writ- 



ing, and general discontinuities 
not only in Greece, but around 
the Mediterranean basin. But 
that’s another story for another 
time and place, and if you want 
me to tell it here, write the Editor 
and ask for it. [By all means! Ed.] 
Archeology is not really a 
“natural” subject for this column, 
and I only went into it this month 
in order to try to play fair with 
Velikovsky. 

I’m willing to learn from any- 
one, and I think there may well 
have been hitherto-unsuspected 
natural disasters in the late 
Bronze Age. For that reason I 
wish mightily that someone better 
qualified than I would read 
Velikovsky’s books with an open 
mind and determine just how 
much real evidence he has in 
among all the other stuff he refer- 
ences. I don’t mean just his 
legends, either, but the physical 
anomalies he describes in Earth 
in Upheaval. 

On the other hand, having ex- 
perienced what Velikovsky does 
to the evidence in a period in 
which I have some knowledge, I 
can understand why professional 
archeologists don’t want to take 
him seriously. It isn’t just that he 
challenges their “orthodoxy”, but 
that he is either ignorant of basic 
facts, which in view of his wide- 
spread reading is hard to believe; 
or that he ignores them, inviting 
others to do the same to 
him. * *

I 

won’t have my brain picked,” 
shouted Everly, squinting over 
the rear sight of the 30-30 and 
aligning the bead on the rocks 
below. “ Not this time! Not again!” 

A faint shadow dodged from 
rock to rock. Eberly squeezed the 
trigger. The rifle bucked against 
his shoulder. Dirt puffed in front 
of the rocks. The shot had fallen 
short. 

“Eberly, give up,” came Plagio’s 
voice, amplified by a bullhorn. 
“You haven’t got a chance. You 
can t fight us. There are too many 
of us.” 

“Where there’s life,” responded 
Eberly, wishing he had something 
pithier and more original to say, 
“there’s hope.” He squeezed off 
another round. Rock shattered. A 
man screamed. 

“You made a contract, Eberly.” 

“An illegal contract.” 

“ But an enforceable contract, 
Eberly.’’’ 

Bullets splattered on the rocks 
around Eberly, punctuating 
Plagio’s comment about the 
contract’s enforceability. Specific 
Performance? Was that what they 
called making someone fulfill his 
contract? Eberly shrugged. 
Maybe they called it Specific Per- 
formance. Maybe they called it 
Fred. Eberly had studied law 
once, but that, too, was gone, 
plucked from his head for a fee. 



He dusted the rock chips from 
his sleeve and decided to change 
position. Plagio and his men were 
too close. Soon they would know 
his exact position. Knowing it, 
they could surround him and 
wait. Even if the Mohave sun 
failed to cook him, hunger and 
thirst would eventually defeat 
him; if he lost consciousness even 
for a minute Plagio would sweep 
down on him, sedate him, carry 
him off and pick his brain. 

Eberly shoved two replacement 
shells into the 30-30. He stuck a 
bookmark into the tattered copy 
of Don Quixote and stuffed it into 
his coat pocket with the box of 
shells. This time, he would finish 
the book. If he had to shoot 
Plagio himself, he would follow 
Don Quixote to the end. 

Quietly, keeping low behind 
the rocks, Eberly scurried toward 
the ledge he had spotted earlier. 
He slung the rifle across his back, 
but hesitated before continuing 
the climb, glancing down. Over 
the ledge, the cliff fell away for 
two hundred meters to the de- 
sert. One slip would leave him 
flattened on the sand or draped 
over a cactus, a sack of broken 
bones. Yet, death with honor 
— even without honor — had ad- 
vantages. It would cheat Plagio of 
his pound of engrams. Momentar- 
ily, Eberly considered jumping, 
then rejected the idea. Any satis- 
faction he might feel at cheating 
Plagio would only be transitory. 



87 




Better to climb higher and hope 
for total victory. 

He began a sideways shuffle 
along the ledge, fingertips strain- 
ing in fissures to hold his body 
against the rock wall. Once, he 
glanced down. His head swirled. 
He looked away, stopping and 
leaning his sweating forehead 
against the cool rock. He tried to 
breathe deeply to calm his nerves. 

“Eberly!” 

“Not now,” muttered Eberly. 
“Don’t distract me.” 

“We see you moving, Eberly. 
We have heat scanners on you.” 

Eberly inched toward the next 
outcropping, trying to ignore the 
distracting voice. 

“ Submit , Eberly. You’ve done it 
before. It takes only a few sec- 
onds. It is painless. Think of your 
wife and children. If you submit, 
they will continue to live in lux- 
ury. If you are killed they will 
have to go on welfare. Your wife 
is too slow-witted to be of use to 
us.’’ 

Now Plagio was insulting 
Gloria. True, Gloria was a slow 
learner. It had taken her four 
years just to master the funda- 
mentals of Rumanian grammer, a 
skill Eberly sold Plagio for fifty 
dollars flat fee. Considering 
Gloria’s faulty preterit and weak 
future subjunctive, along with her 
complete inability to understand 
the Rumanian relative pronoun, it 
was probably a good price. Still, 
Plagio had no reason to insult her. 



“Your own wife pronounced 
French like a Bulgarian ,” shouted 
Eberly. 

An angry burst of rifle fire ans- 
wered. 

Eberly reached the outcrop- 
ping and relative safety. To the 
west, the sun, an elongated 
orange ball on the desert horizon, 
was setting. No one would try to 
cross the ledge at night. If he 
could hold them off until after 
dark, he could finish the last two 
hundred pages of Don Quixote. 

Eberly unslung the rifle and 
positioned himself behind a tall 
rock with a V-shaped notch in the 
top, resting the gun barrel in the 
notch. At this distance, he would 
need all the stability he could find 
to keep Plagio pinned down. 
Below, he heard gravel slip. He 
fired twice. 

“No,” he muttered. “Save the 
ammunition. Only shoot when I 
see something worth shooting.” 

He got out the box of shells and 
opened it, replacing the two spent 
rounds and counting the rest in 
the fading light. Thirty rounds, 
including those in the rifle. 
Hardly enough for a war but ade- 
quate to hold off Plagio. 

“Eberly!” 

“Brain picker!" shouted Eberly. 
“Filthy brain picker!” 

“1 harvest a crop. Nothing 
more. We have had a profitable 
arrangement in the past, Eberly. 
Why can’t it continue ?”

“Why can’t I finish Don Qui- 
xote?” 

“I am a reasonable man. How — ” 

“You are a pig and a brain 
picker!” 

“As I was saying, I am a 
reasonable man, a businessman. 
How much do you have to go to 
finish it?” 

“ About two hundred pages.” 

A pause ensued. “ How long will 
it take you?” 

“In this light? All night. Maybe 
longer.” 

“How long with a good reading 
lamp?” 

“ Four or five hours. ’ 

“It’s too long. The customer is 
waiting. He has a final exam in 
Spanish tomorrow at eleven a.m. 
He’s paid in advance. We have to 
set up the equipment, make the 
extraction and the implant, then 
get him back to Los Angeles for 
the exam. Submit, Eberly. You 
can finish the book next time.” 

Next time. Eberly had already 
learned Spanish seven times. 
Each time, when he mastered the 
ability sufficiently to read Don 
Quixote, Plagio, who used Don 
Quixote as the objective test of 
Spanish mastery, extracted the 
skill from him, leaving Don Qui- 
xote or Sancho Panza or the beauti- 
ful Dulcinea or the not so beauti- 
ful Rosinante in some dire situa- 
tion and Eberly unable to find out 
what happened. He was thankful, 
at least, that he could remember 
the plot. Plagio only took the lan- 



guage skill, not the information it 
conveyed. 

“Plagio!” yelled Eberly. 

“What?” 

“You said the same thing last 
time and the time before that. It’s 
no go. You’ll never let me finish. 
Next time will be exactly like this 
time. As soon as I can read it, 
you’ll pick my brain. I won’t even 
know how to say buenos dias." 

“ Read it in translation.” 

Infuriated by Plagio’s aesthetic 
insensitivity, Eberly muttered, 
“ Carumba ,” and squeezed off 
three rounds. His ears rang from 
the explosions. 

“ Eberly , what was that for?” 

“Because it’s never the same in 
translation, you philistine!” 

Eberly sat down behind the 
rocks, planning to take advantage 
of the last rays of sunlight. He 
opened Don Quixote and began 
looking for his place. 

“Let’s see, they came to the inn 
and Don Quixote fell asleep 
and — ah, here it is. The curate 
has just said the original cause of 
Don Quixote’s madness was from 
reading books.” 

Eberly became immersed in his 
book. Eventually, the light faded 
completely. He withdrew a pen- 
light from his shirt pocket, but in- 
stead of flicking it on to read, he 
leaned back against the rocks. His 
escape from Plagio’s Palm Springs 
home had unexpectedly drained 
him. He had planned to escape, 
then make his way to the main

highway and thumb a ride to Los 
Angeles. Somehow — probably 
from crashing through the win- 
dow, an act he found considerably 
more unnerving and more difficult 
than in the movies (It had taken 
two trys and the help of the rifle 
butt to get through the plate 
glass) — his sense of direction had 
become addled. Instead of striking 
out toward the highway, he had 
struck out across the desert. He 
had expected Plagio to follow im- 
mediately. Evidently, Plagio’s 
henchman, Marvin The Extractor, 
a name referring to Marvin’s per- 
forming illicit engramectomies, 
had remained unconscious longer 
than expected. The glancing blow 
with the Ming vase, shattering 
the vase, had felt too light to put 
Marvin out long, but after an 
hour of walking, Eberly had 
looked back and seen no sign of 
pursuit. Only when he neared the 
rocks three hours later and started 
his climb to reconnoiter and get 
his bearings did he see the jeep, 
bouncing toward him across the 
desert. 

“Eberly. ” 

Eberly noticed how the voice 
carried in the night air, making 
Plagio seem to be right on top of 
him. “What?” 

“Can we make a deal?” 

“ What kind of deal?" 

“You submit and — ” 

“Never!” 

“You submit and I'll give you 
three weeks paid vacation in 



Acapulco before you start on your 
next subject." 

“What good will Acapulco be if 
I don’t know Spanish?” 

“You don’t have to talk to any- 
one.” 

“I like talking to people.” 

“ O.K . , make it Miami — 
anywhere. ” 

Eberly thought about it. 
Plagio must be desperate. He had 
never offered Eberly a vacation 
before. He always expected Eb- 
erly to be back at the books the 
day after an extraction. The client 
must be someone big, or the son 
of someone big, possibly one of 
Plagio’s superiors. In spite of the 
dominating figure Plagio had be- 
come in Eberly’s life, Eberly 
knew Plagio was small fry to the 
Organization, that vague and only 
obliquely-mentioned group who 
financed Plagio. When Congress 
outlawed engram transplants in 
the early 1990’s, claiming it al- 
lowed the rich to become not only 
richer but smarter, organized 
crime moved in. The price to col- 
lege students, harried executives 
without time to take night classes, 
or any of the myriad other slow- 
learners in society had actually 
dropped when people like Plagio 
took over. The American Medical 
Association had maintained the 
cost of the operation at such arti- 
ficially high levels — they fought 
the criminalization of engram ex- 
traction tooth and nail, but popu-

GALAXY 




lar sentiment and the proximity of 
a congressional election carried 
the day — that even the illegality 
of the procedure failed to sustain 
the high price. Nowadays, a col- 
lege student with five thousand 
dollars and a disinclination to 
study — by the looks of Plagio’s 
balance sheet, something close to 
eighty percent of the students in 
the country engaged in “cram- 
ming” as it was colloquially 
called — could buy French, Ger- 
man, Spanish or any western lan- 
guage at a level sufficient to sus- 
tain them through graduate study. 
Slavic, Oriental and African lan- 
guages, along with ancient lan- 
guages, came slightly higher. 
Other subjects varied according to 
the job market. One year sciences 
would be expensive, the next, law 
or medicine. Liberal Arts seldom 
became economically interesting 
enough to transplant, except 
foreign languages, Eberly’s spe- 
cialty. Group rates were also 
available, allowing students to pass 
around skills as needed. Plagio 
preferred to sell to groups, frater- 
nities and sororities. Though the 
fee per person was smaller, the 
total was larger and the 
overhead — supporting people like 
Eberly, who had a gift for lan- 
guage learning (He had once 
learned Kurdish in seven weeks.) 
remained constant. 

Still, if Plagio were so anxious 
to deliver, the customer must be 
important. Did that fact give Eb- 



erly some bargaining power? 
Maybe. 

“Plagio.” 

“What?” 

“Who’s the customer ?” 

“What’s it to you?” 

“I’ve got a deal of my own to 

“Let’s have it.” 

“You let me finish this book and 
I’ll submit. Tell the customer to 
call in sick.” 

“He tried that already. His 
teacher doesn’t give makeup 
exams. If he doesn’t take the 
exam, he flunks. If he flunks, he’s 
out of school — he’s a borderline 
case already. If he’s out of school, 
you know what that means.” 

“One less future customer for 
you.” 

“Right." 

“Is that all you think about, 
Plagio, money?” 

“It makes the world go round, 
Eberly 

“There’s more to life than 
money. ’’ 

“What?” 

At a loss, Eberly hedged. “Why 
can’t you be reasonable?” 

“I think I am being reasonable. 
You’re the one that’s fighting the 
system and being unreasonable. 
What can you gain? A Pyrrhic 
victory?” 

“A what?” 

“Are you forgetting your En- 
glish?” 

Eberly shook his head. Pyrrhic? 
It was Greek to him. He shrug-

ged and sat down, flicking on the 
penlight. Plagio would never un- 
derstand. Things other than 
money drove some men, things 
with intrinsic merit, things with- 
out market value. He began to 
read. The dot of light danced 
across the page, illuminating accent 
marks and tildes. He read on. 
Don Quixote, once more mounted 
and questing, galloped, or rather, 
considering the nature of the 
sway-backed Rosinante, plodded 
through Eberly’s brain. If only, 
mused Eberly, he had some mod- 
em equivalent to Rosinante, some 
charger, sound of limb and ready 
for flight, some jennet or jade 
or — 

“Jeep,” said Eberly. 

He stood up and peered around 
the rocks. No sign of Plagio. 
Vaguely oudined below him, visible 
in the starlight only as a rectangu- 
lar lump on the sand, stood the 
jeep. 

“But how?” wondered Eberly 
aloud. 

If he retraced his steps, cross- 
ing the rock ledge, Plagio would 
see him. Plagio’s heat scanner 
worked even better at night. 
Searching the rocks for an alter- 
nate exit, he found the only pos- 
sibility, a sheer descent to the de- 
sert floor. Looking at the drop he 
felt himself sway. It would be dif- 
ficult during the day. At night, it 
would be impossible. He decided 
to wait for dawn, and then de- 
scend and try for the jeep. 

92 



Dawn, tentative, gradual, 
then more assertive, arrived just 
as the battery in Eberly’s penlight 
gave out, sending its faint emana- 
tions over the desert horizon. 
Though he had only ten pages to 
go to finish Don Quixote, he de- 
cided to postpone the pleasure. 
Dawn would rouse Plagio, too. If 
Plagio arrived before the end of 
the book — Eberly broke off, un- 
willing to .let the thought appear 
in his mind. 

He stuffed his belongings into 
his jacket, checked the rifle and 
prepared for the descent. If he 
were lucky, he would make it to 
the jeep and freedom before 
Plagio noticed. 

“Eberly. ” 

Should he answer? If he failed 
to answer, Plagio would boldly 
climb the rocks to inspect, think- 
ing Eberly had escaped in the 
night. He wanted Plagio pinned 
in the rocks as long as possible. 

“ What is it now , mind raper!” 
“Eberly, do you have to use in- 
sulting language like that? I have 
always treated you fairly. ” 

“Like a prize Hereford, ready 
for milking. ” 

“A Hereford’s a steer.” 

“Call it what you will, brain 
picker! You understand what I 
mean.” 

“No, I don’t, Eberly. I don’t 
understand you at all. I thought I 
did, once. 1 thought you were like 
the rest of us. I thought you knew 
what was important in life. ” 

GALAXY 




“Money.” 

“That’s right. What you can’t 
sell in the market place isn’t worth 
having.” 

“It’s a form of intellectual pros- 
titution, Plagio.’ 

“Prostitution’s a marketable 
skill, Eberly. If you think Gloria’s 
game, I’m sure I can find a spot 
for — ” 

“INTELLECTUAL prostitution, 

I said.” 

“Oh, Sorry. It’s hard to hear in 
these rocks.” 

“You drain people’s minds for 
profit, PlagiO." 

“As I said, I harvest a crop. 
The crop is in demand. It’s the 
way of the world, Eberly. Submit 
to it.” 

“Submit,” muttered Eberly, 
jacking a shell into the chamber of 
the 30-30, about to pop up over 
the top of a rock and get ofT a 
shot. He controlled himself. 
Plagio probably wanted him to 
show himself. Though Plagio 
would have instructed his men to 
shoot for the torso, thus saving 
the brain and its engrams, Eberly 
felt little comfort in the idea. 
Plagio could extract the engrams 
for up to two or three hours after 
death. No, he would remain hid- 
den. 

“Eberly.” 

“What?” 

“When did you suddenly get 
morality?” 

"What do ijou mean?” 

“ You’ve worked with me for the 



last ten years. You’ve never com- 
plained before.” 

“I never complained because I 
was hooked.” 

“Narcotics? They will interfere 
with your learning capacity, Eb- 
erly. ” 

“Not narcotics-money!” 

A sarcastic edge came into 
Plagjio’s amplified voice. “But now 
you’re not hooked.” 

Eberly thought about Gloria, 
about the kids, Ephraim and 
Ezekiel, both born when he was 
studying Biblical Greek. The 
money, arriving every Friday like 
clock-work, never late, never 
short, had kept him going. Each 
time he wanted to do something 
for himself — branch out into busi- 
ness, or go back to school and 
learn something unsaleable (His- 
tory or Literature) — money and 
the soft seduction of luxury, along 
with Glory’s spendthrift nature, 
kept his nose in a grammer book, 
conjugating Estonian verbs. Ten 
years without once doing some- 
thing for himself. Ten years with- 
out taking his eyes from the de- 
mands of the market place. Ten 
years without doing something for 
its intrinsic worth. It was ten 
years too long. Plagio might know 
what Hereford meant — a 
Hereford could be sold on the 
market — but he would never un- 
derstand the meaning of intrinsic 
worth, a thing done for itself, a 
windmill tilted. No, Eberly was 
no longer hooked, at least for the 



THE LINGUIST 



93 




moment, on money. He was 
hooked on something more com- 
pelling, something he had to do, 
if only once, for himself. Casting 
his eyes up to the last fading star 
in the west, Eberly, hand in his 
jacket pocket, held tightly to Don 
Quixote. 

“It’s time to try for the jeep.” 

The descent was steeper than 
Eberly anticipated. He tore his 
pantleg on the rocks, almost 
dropped the rifle once, and hung 
by his fingertips innumerable 
times, sweating and scrambling 
for a foothold. Eventually, hands 
tom and bleeding from the sharp 
rocks, he dropped the last three 
meters to the desert, narrowly 
missing a kangoroo rat, who 
looked at him — frozen except for 
its twitching nose — then fled. 

“You’re lucky,” said Eberly to 
the vanished rat. “No Plagios in 
your life.” 

During his descent, the sun 
had climbed up the sky. It baked 
the desert and broiled Eberly. 
June was a less than accommodat- 
ing month in the Mohave. Eberly 
wished he had a hat. He wiped 
his forehead on his sleeve, plan- 
ning his next move. Approach the 
jeep by stealth or rush it? Should 
he try for the jeep at all? Plagio 
or one of his men might be close 
to it. They could put a bullet 
through him before he could drop 
the jeep into low. Perhaps he 
should exploit his small advantage 



and head into the desert. And the 
keys, what if they were in Plagio’s 
pocket? Eberly glanced at the 
sun. He could almost hear it 
crackling. No, the desert was out. 
It had to be the jeep, the jeep or 
surrend — 

“Never.” 

The keys. If the keys were miss- 
ing, he could sabotage the jeep 
and try to escape on foot. Either 
way, it was his only chance. 

Keeping low, he worked his 
way around the base of the rock 
pile. With luck, Plagio would be 
above him, looking up and shout- 
ing into his bullhorn. 

“Eberly.” 

Hypothesis proved. Plagio was 
still talking to him. Getting no 
answer, Plagio would be drawn 
farther up the rocks and farther 
away from the jeep. 

“ Eberly , answer me.”- 

Eberly chuckled, amused at fool- 
ing Plagio, then tensed, freezing 
behind a man-sized boulder. The 
scraping footsteps of a man de- 
scending in gravel had frozen 
him. Cautiously, he peered 
around the boulder, keeping low. 
The jeep stood on a sand dune 
about twenty meters from the 
rocks. Marvin The Extractor, his 
elongated head like a loaf of bread 
with hair, approached it. Horror- 
struck, Eberly watched as Marvin 
leaned across the driver’s seat and 
plucked the keys from the igni- 
tion. Plagio was one step ahead of 
him. 



94 



GALAXY 




Throwing caution, and, inadver- 
tently, his penlight, to the wind, 
Eberly — leaving his crouch be- 
hind the rocks like a Marine leav- 
ing a landing craft, rifle gripped at 
the small of the stock and the bar- 
rel, holding it almost horizontal 
before him, a fearsome, bared- 
tooth leer on his face — charged. 
Charging on sand proved a slow 
business. Still, he managed to 
surprise Marvin, noting, before 
Marvin turned, the white bandage 
on the back of Marvin’s head 
where the vase had landed. 

Marvin turned, saw Eberly 
sturggling up the dune, started to 
laugh — pointing his finger — as 
Eberly took a comic pratfall in the 
loose sand, changed his mind and 
went for his sidearm, a .45 in a 
flap holster. Marvin’s attempted 
laugh fueled Eberly’s rage. Eberly 
reached the top of the dune. Mar- 
vin had the holster flap up and 
the gun half-withdrawn. Eberly 
swung with the rifle butt, con- 
necting with the side of Marvin’s 
loaf-shaped head. Marvin, staring 
blankly, dazed, stood a moment 
after the blow, shook his head 
once, then wilted. His uncon- 
scious body began rolling down 
the dune like a log. 

Rolling, Marvin’s .45 went off. 

“Damn it,” muttered Eberly, 
frowning, “why don’t you tell the 
whole world, Marvin.” 

The shot would bring Plagio. 
Eberly scrambled after the rolling 
man. Abruptly, Marvin stopped 



rolling, almost tripping Eberly. 
Eberly knelt and gave the prone 
figure a slight nudge. It flopped 
on its back, snorting sand and be- 
ginning to breathe again. Quickly, 
Eberly rifled the pockets, coming 
up with two sets of keys, one pre- 
sumably for the jeep and the 
other for Marvin’s car. 

He shook Marvin. 

“Wake up, you creep.” 

Marvin’s eyes started to open, 
narrow slits in the sand-matted 
face. Eberly dangled both sets of 
keys before Marvin’s eyes. 

“Which of these fits the jeep?” 

The eyes closed. The head 
lolled. 

“Marvin, damn it, wake up.” 
He slapped Marvin once. The 
blow succeeded only in pushing 
Marvin farther down the dune. 

Sand kicked up near Marvin’s 
head, followed almost im- 
mediately by the sound of rifle 
fire. Eberly looked up. Plagio and 
two men, half inch figures resting 
their rifles on rocks, fired at him. 

Taking both sets of keys, he left 
Marvin and started up the dune. 
Sand hopped and jumped around 
his feet. He heard one stray 
round plink off the jeep. Only 
when he reached the relative 
safety of the opposite side of the 
jeep did he look back. Plagio, 
kneeling, and the two men, stand- 
ing behind him and firing, had 
reached the base of the rock pile. 

Eberly steadied the rifle across 
the hood of the jeep and fired 



THE LINGUIST 



95 




four quick rounds. Though he 
could see none of them hit, 
Plagio, scurrying for the rocks, 
must have gotten the message. 

Eberly reloaded and got into 
the jeep. Frantically, he tried the 
keys, innumerable keys on both 
chains. Why did Marvin carry so 
many keys? Vaguely, Eberly re- 
membered a commeht of Plagio’s. 
Marvin, before setting up as an 
engram extractor, had stolen cars. 
It explained much of Marvin’s 
character, the joy he took in his 
work. Stealing cars, stealing en- 
grains, they both gave Marvin the 
same illicit thrill. A key fit. 

Eberly stomped the clutch to 
the floor and twisted the key. The 
jeep ground, coughed and caught, 
coming alive. He jammed the 
gearshift into first and popped the 
clutch. The jeep lurched, almost 
seemed to hop, and then stopped, 
stalled. 

Eberly restarted it, this time 
gently releasing the clutch. The 
engine uttered a decrescendo of 
slowing, labored, lugging noises, 
stalling. 

Eberly checked the emergency 
brake — off — then leaned out to 
look at the front tire — flat. At the 
instant Eberly had popped the 
clutch, Plagio’s aim had evidently 
proven true. It accounted for the 
hopping sensation. 

“What now?” asked Eberly, 
staring at the flat tire. 

A bullet shattered the 
windshield, leaving a hole sur- 



rounded by a spiderweb of cracked 
glass. 

“Take cover,” answered Eberly. 

He got out of the jeep and 
crawled under it, positioning him- 
self so Plagio would have to 
charge straight up the dune and 
into his rifle fire. 

Furtively, Plagio attempted to 
dart from the rocks. Eberly fired. 
Sand spurted at Plagio’s feet. The 
figure retreated, shaking its fist at 
Eberly. After several seconds, the 
bullhorn came on. 

“Eberly.’ 

Eberly cupped his hands 
around his mouth, answering. 
“What?" 

“You can’t escape now. You 
may have us pinned down but 
we’ve got you pinned down, too. 
And that jeep isn’t going any- 
where. It’s a standoff, Eberly. 
Give up.’’ 

Suddenly, inexplicably, doubt 
surfaced in Eberly ’s mind. Plagio 
was right, a standoff. What could 
he hope to gain by resisting 
Plagio? Actually, the man wanted 
nothing more than his due, com- 
pletion of the illegal contract. 
What was wrong with that? In re- 
turn, Eberly would get not only 
his life, something he had always 
found useful, but life in luxury. 

Conscious of his own mortality, 
conscious of the shortness of life, 
conscious also that he was out- 
gunned, Eberly considered sub- 
mitting. He had responsibilities, 



96 



GALAXY 




Gloria and the children. Selfish- 
ness, a quality he abhorred on 
principle though practiced from 
time to time, was no reason to 
deny his family the good life, was 
it? He imagined Gloria in the wel- 
fare line, dress in rags, hair fraz- 
zled, people crowding in front of 
her. He imagined Ephraim and 
Ezekiel, selling pencils, begging 
from strangers, their eyes tear- 
filled and pitiful. And why? 

Eberly crawled out from under 
the jeep, disgusted with himself, 
preparing to surrender. He stood 
up and took the copy of Don 
Quixote from his pocket, glaring 
at it. 

“Because of you,” he snarled. 
“ That’s why!” 

He hurled the book to the sand 
and began hopping on it with 
both feet. 

“You! You! You! Traitor! 
Seducer! What the hell good are 
you anyway?” 

He stopped hopping, stepping 
back from the book. It had fallen 
on its spine, open to the page 
with Eberly’s bookmark. He 
looked at the half-buried book, 
breathing deeply and trying to 
control his fury, pondering. 

A bullet whizzed past his ear, 
jerking him from his ponderings. 
He dropped to the sand, nose in- 
ches from the book. Plagio, una- 
ware of Eberly’s intent to surren- 
der, was still firing. 

"Plagio ,” shouted Eberly. 

The firing ceased. "What?” 



“I want — ” The words seemed to 
stick in his throat. 

"You want what?” 

"I want to — ” Eberly broke off, 
his attention attracted by the page 
in front of his nose. He began to 
read. 

“ You want to what?” coaxed 
Plagio. 

“Just a minute.” 

"Eberly?” 

"Just a minute!” 

Eberly became lost in the 
knight’s final return home. Sancho 
Panza’s wife, Joan Panza, after 
asking about the health of 
Sancho’s donkey (Better, an- 
swered the squire, than that of the 
master), inquired what profit the 
squire had gained from his adven- 
tures, what dresses for Mrs. 
Panza, what shoes for the chil- 
dren? 

I bring none of these things, 
good wife, quoth Sancho, 
although 1 bring other things of 
more moment and estimation. 

“More moment and estima- 
tion,” mumbled Eberly, sniffing, 
a tear beginning its journey down 
his cheek. Doubt again surfaced 
in his mind, this time challenging 
his desire to surrender. His voice 
changed, hardening, determina- 
tion encrusting every syllable. 

“More moment and estima- 
tion.” 

He looked over the top of the 
book. Plagio was nowhere in 
sight. 

"Plagio!” 



THE LINGUIST

No answer. He looked down 
the sloping dune. Something odd, 
or rather, the lack of. something 
odd — Marvin — attracted his atten- 
tion. Had Marvin revived? Or — 

Grasping the book in one hand 
and the rifle in the other, Eberly 
crawled under the jeep, elbows 
and knees dragging him forward. 
He reached the crest of the dune. 
Temorously, he looked over. The 
dune dipped in the area of 
Marvin’s body, creating natural 
cover, obscuring Eberly’s line of 
fire. He could see the tops of 
three heads behind the dip. 
While Eberly read, Plagio and his 
men had reached Marvin. They 
advanced out of the divot on their 
stomachs. Seeing him, they fired, 
rifles blazing in rapid succession. 
Sand hopped and skipped on all 
sides. 

Repositioning the book slightly, 
Eberly rested the rifle barrel 
along the book’s inner crease and 
aimed. He fired twice, halting 
Plagio’s advance. He glanced 
down at the page next to the bar- 
rel, reading on. 

Proceeding in this manner, fir- 
ing and reading, pausing occa- 
sionally to turn a page or reload, 
Eberly impeded Plagio’s advance 
and followed Don Quixote’s. He 
read through the sonnets and 
epitaphs of the last few pages, 
eventually arriving at both the last 
paragraph and his last bullet. 

A scholar, read Eberly, had 
been given the moldy, time-worn 



papers treating of the life and do- 
ings of Don Quijote de la Mancha 
and had, according to the author, 
(someone named Cervantes) de- 
ciphered them. They promised to 
tell of further exploits, a third 
sally for the great knight. 

“A third sally,” said Eberly, 
closing the book and firing the 
last round. Another tear formed 
in his eye as he wistfully imagined 
the third sally. 

“Eberly.” 

The voice of reality. “What?” 

“By my count, you’re out of 
ammunition. We re coming up." 

Eberly rolled on his back, 
throwing his arms out to either 
side and letting the sun warm his 
face. He spoke quietly. “Come 
and get me, vulture. I’m ready.” 

He could hear Plagio marching 
up the dune. What had Plagio 
scheduled him for next time? Ah, 
yes, Russian. For the fifth time, 
Russian. In that word, Eberly saw 
his future. Russian would be hard- 
er than Spanish. First of all, that 
funny alphabet, like barbed-wire 
he would have to penetrate to get 
at the language. Secondly, it 
would take more time and effort 
to plan carefully, plus more en- 
durance to carry out the plan. 
Momentarily, he shuddered at the 
rigors that lay ahead. At the same 
time, he welcomed them. What 
else could a man do who was driv- 
en from within? What else could 
a man do who was only on page 
fifteen of War and Peace?

“Alter, it’s time for you to vent

“I’ll vent when I feel like 'it. 
Hey, you! I asked you a question!

love to rant and rave against the 



organized conspiracy, the plot to 
destroy science fiction as we know 
it! The enemy is everywhere, in- 
sidiously scheming. Well, 
you know I’ve been reading all 
my life and I make no bones 
about it. I’ve had it up to 
here — over my bloody 
head! — with what are called ‘liter- 
ary values’. They are an intellec- 
tual con-game, an elitist ego-trip,

Geis? Gotta balance my sen- 
tence.” 

“Uhhh. .” 

“Hopeless. You’re — ” 

“All right, let’s hear you define 
exactly ‘literary values’. You hate 
them so much, you ought to know 
what you hate.” 

“C’mon, Geis, you know! Ex- 
cessive, pretentious, obsessive 
characterization. Deep, Important 
Thoughts. Significance. No sci- 
ence fiction writer alive today can 
win a Hugo or a Nehula without a 
heap of Significance and Sym- 
bolism. Actually, Symbolism is 
even better — a good Christ-figure, 
a birth trauma, an Earth 
Mother. .a Succubus. .the 
orgasmic Symbolism, for instance, 
of Bob Shaw’s hero in his phallus 
spaceship thrusting, raping, the 
vagina’ of Orbitsville and going 
deep into the dyson sphere

bolism! Of course, a good critic 
can find a Symbol in any story or 
scene or. Writers always use 
symbols. .it’s unavoidable.”

“So how are these hated ‘liter- 
ary values’ ruining science fiction? 
And let me say, Alter, that this all 
has a familiar ring to it. Can’t you 
rant about something else?” 

“Of course, and I will next 
time, Geis. I’m just reinforcing an 
engram. Hitting the nail on the 
head to drive it deeper. Repeti- 
tion is the heart of propaganda, 
the soul of advertising, the karma

“Get on with it.” 

“It comes down to. .well, let 
me explain it this way. See, in 
porno writing — at which you are 
an expert, eh? — the sex impera-

rative consideration. The plot, 
characterization, locale, the whole 
schmeer is bent and twisted to 
serve the sex scenes, sex scenes, 
and more sex scenes. Right? So. 
What is happening in science fic- 
tion nowdays is that the genre is 
sliding gradually into the bed of 
the literary mainstream- and get- 
ting seduced. .seduced. You 
sure that isn’t a girl?” 

“That is not a ‘girl’. Seduced

“Getting seduced — well, gradu-

“In a word. Alter, science fic-

prostituted science fiction to the

Science fiction should be fun and

and a few writers still cling to the 
reader imperative), but more and 
more it is boring, serious, ego- 
trippy, Literary. .serving a new 
set of masters. Hail and farewell.” 
“You exaggerate. You overstate. 
You oversimplify.” 

“Maybe. But when certain lead- 
ing lights in the s-f scene lust for 
respectability and academic accep- 
tance and start calling their work 
and our genre ‘speculative fiction’ 
and ‘speculative fantasy’, that’s a 
signal I find difficult to ignore.” 
“Alter, you are a troglodyte, an 
arch reactionary with your head 
buried firmly in 1937. That was 
the year, I recall, that you read 
your first science fiction 
magazine — a tattered copy of 
ASTONISHING SUPER SCIENCE 
STORIES.” 

“Sure, sure, I know that old 
put-down: there’s a ten-year-old 
in this 47-year-old mass of aches 
and pains who is yowling for the 
good old days. I’m hip that most 
of those pulp-days stories were 
God-Awful and I’d hold my nose 
if I read them today. But — ”

danger, life-and-death, gosh-wow, 
malevolent aliens, space 
wars. .all that discredited raygun

“damn right! If it’s done 
realistically and with skill and tal-

palid, gutless, soul-searching, 
whining, mystical, considerate, 
socially conscious crap that’s pas- 
sing as science fiction today. 
Writers today are becoming afraid 
to be entertainers and ‘commer- 
cial’ in science fiction now. They’ll 
be sneered at, they fear, and not 
approved for reading in S-F 101

have come to that.” 

“But, if this new type of science 
fiction is what the readers

“Oh, Geis! In the depression of

they do now! Now IF is gone.

“Well, there’s TV, poor dis- 
tribution of magazines. ...” 

“Bullshit. If there were as many 
science fiction programs on TV as 
there are detective shows, I’d 
maybe agree. .to a degree. But 
printed fiction has many advan- 
tages over TV fiction — if it’s 
GOOD fiction. As for the poor 
distribution argument. .if s-f

demand for the mags, you better 
believe the distributors would de-

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 




WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

I had been back in Amber for 
less than a week when my 
brother Caine was killed, killed 
in such a fashion as to make me 
the logical suspect. Only, I had 
arrived on the scene a trifle 
ahead of schedule. I got my 
hands on the real culprit and in- 
tended to question him. He was 
understandably displeased with 
this, and circumstances required 
that I kill him in order to deal 
properly with his displeasure. 
This left me more than dis- 
pleased. It left me without an 
adequate defense. But there was 
something strangely familiar 
about the guy: He strongly re- 
sembled one of those creatures 
which had come in pursuit of 
Random, back when he had 
sought sanctuary at Flora’s place 
in Westchester, years ago. 

I buried Caine and bore his 
killer’s remains to the palace. 
Random had never explained 
what had been going on back at 
that time. I realized I had better 
have the story fast, before I let 
the others know what had be- 
come of Caine. 

When I got to him, Random 
told me that years before, when 
he had been living off in Shadow, 
he had received a cryptic mes- 
sage from our missing brother, 
Brand. Brand had indicated that 
he was a prisoner in a peculiar 
place: a burning, sunless land of 
revolving rocks and drifting dead. 
There he was held in an isolated 
tower, guarded by a transparent 
serpent and a squad of strange 
troops. Random had decided to 
go to his rescue. 



Steering his sail plane through 
Shadow to that place. Random 
had mounted to the tower and 
fought with the serpent. He fi- 
nally dispatched the creature, but 
was unable to effect Brand’s re- 
lease. Weaponless, battered and 
with a sprained ankle, he had 
been forced to flee aboard one of 
the moving boulders. He was 
pursued by the tower’s guards, 
with whom he fought several 
skirmishes. In the process, he 
learned of their anatomical 
peculiarities, the features they 
shared with Caine’s killer. 

He fled through Shadow, and 
somehow they were able to pur- 
sue him, an exercise normally re- 
stricted to those who are related 
by blood to the royal family of 
Amber. He finally decided to 
head for the shadow Earth, 
where sister Flora dwelled. 

In the meantime, he was con- 
tacted by Julian, via his Trump, 
and advised that Eric was con- 
templating taking the throne, in 
light of Dad’s Tong and unac- 
countable absence. Various 
speculations had passed through 
his mind at this point, but there 
was really nothing he could do 
about the situation, one way or 
the other. 

Arriving in California and dis- 
covering that his pursuers were 
still with him, Random had 
phoned Flora’s place and I had 
received the call. He had flown 
over in response to my offer of 
assistance, and the creatures had 
not been far behind. The rest I 
knew. 

Of all the conjectures we then 
made, the only one that seemed 



105 




certain was that some part of the 
family itself was behind the en- 
tire business. That in mind, it 
seemed advisable to have at hand 
every weapon available to me. So 
I fetched the Jewel of Judgment 
and took it down to the Pattern, 
where I went through the process 
of attuning it. This was a some- 
what involved procedure, but its 
results were satisfactory. After 
that, I was able to use it for pur- 
poses of controlling the elements. 

I then questioned Flora at 
some length as to how she had 
come to be my warden off on 
that shadow Earth. She alleged 
having encountered me by acci- 
dent, in France, on the eve of 
those events which so delight his- 
torical novelists, around the end 
of the eighteenth century. She 
had told Eric of this and became 
his confidante as to how I had 
gotten where I was. She agreed 
to take up residence in that place 
and keep an eye on me in return 
for favors to come. She refused 
to admit any direct involvement 
in my accident. It seemed to me 
that she knew more than she was 
telling, but I was in an awkward 
position when it came to pressing 
her on that point; that is, I was 
still missing a few days from my 
memory collection, and this was a 
matter I wanted to keep to my- 
self. She agreed to identify tbe 
corpse of Caine’s slayer as of the 
same ilk as those who had once 
pursued Random into her home. 
She agreed to support me in any- 
thing I might be about. Blessed 
are the pure in heart. I went and 
got drunk in my tomb and told 
Canelon my troubles. 

106 



The following day, Gerard ac- 
companied me to the Grove of 
the Unicorn, to retrieve Caine’s 
body. On the way, he paused to 
beat me unconscious, to show me 
he could still do it, to show me he 
could make good on what he then 
promised; i.e., that he Would kill 
me if I should turn out to be the 
one behind the plot that was ob- 
viously underfoot, overhead and 
pressing in on all sides. The 
others, he informed me, were 
watching his performance over 
his Trump, so that any reprisal 
against him would constitute an 
admission of guilt on my part. I 
told him — and my viewing audi- 
ence, by proxy — that this did not 
necessarily follow, and I had to 
let it go at that. There was no- 
thing much else that I could do. 

We proceeded to the grove and 
disinterred Caine. While we 
were about it, the unicorn put in 
an appearance. I had never seen 
it before and neither had 
Gerard. I hoped it was a good 
omen, for the beast is the patron 
of Amber. 

Then we headed back, and I 
had a definite course of action in 
mind for a change, for that 
Evening. One that involved 
— unavoidably — cooperation on 
the part of the family.

swered by Random with a nod and 
a friendly obscenity. 

We were in the library, and I 
was seated on the edge of the big 
desk. Random occupied a chair to 
my right. Gerard stood at the 
other end of the room, inspecting 
some weapons that hung on the 
wall. Or maybe it was Rein’s etch- 
ing of the unicorn he was looking 
at. Whichever, along with our- 
selves, he was also ignoring Julian, 
who was slouched in an easy chair 
beside the display cases, right 
center, legs extended and crossed 
at the ankles, arms folded, staring 
down at his scaley boots. Fiona 
— five-two, perhaps, in height 
—green eyes fixed on Flora’s blue 
own as they spoke, there beside 
the fireplace, hair more than 
compensating for the vacant 
hearth, smouldering, reminded 
me, as always, of something from 
which the artist had just drawn 
back, setting aside his tools, ques- 
tions slowly forming behind his 
smile. The place at the base of 
her throat where his thumb had 
notched the collarbone always 
drew my eyes as the mark of a 
master craftsman, especially when 
she raised her head, quizzical or 
imperious, to regard us taller 
others. She smiled faintly, just 
then, doubtless aware of my gaze, 
an almost clairvoyant faculty the 
acceptance of which has never 
deprived of its ability to discon- 
cert. Llewella, off in a corner, 
pretending to study a book, had 
her back to the rest of us, her 
green tresses bobbed a couple 
inches above her dark collar. 
Whether her withdrawal involved 
animus, self-consciousness in her 



alienation or simple caution, I 
could never be certain. Probably 
something of all these. Hers was 
not that familiar a presence in 
Amber. 

.... And the fact that we con- 
stituted a collection of individuals 
rather than a group, a family, at a 
time when I wanted to achieve 
some over-identity, some will to 
cooperate, was what led to my 
observations and Random’s ac- 
knowledgement. 

I felt a familiar presence, heard 
a “Hello, Corwin’ and there was 
Deirdre, reaching toward me. I 
extended my hand, clasped her 
own, raised it. She took a step 
forward, as if to the first strain of 
some formal dance and moved 
close, facing me. For an instant, a 
rilled window had framed her 
ead and shoulders and a rich 
tapestry had adorned the wall to 
her left. Planned and posed, of 
course. Still, effective. She held 
my Trump in her left hand. She 
smiled. The others glanced our 
way as she appeared and she hit 
them all with that smile, like the 
Mona Lisa with a machine gun, 
turning slowly. 

“Corwin,” she said, kissing me 
briefly and withdrawing, “I fear I 
am early.” 

“Never,” I replied, turning to- 
ward Random, who had just risen 
and who anticipated me by sec- 
onds. 

“May I fetch you a drink, sis- 
ter?” he asked, taking her hand 
and nodding toward the 
sideboard. 

“Why, yes. Thank you,” and he 
led her off and poured her some 
wine, avoiding or at least postpon- 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN

ing, I suppose, her usual clash 
with Flora. At least, I assumed 
most of the old frictions were still 
alive as I remembered them. So if 
it cost me her company for the 
moment it also maintained the 
domestic tranquility index, which 
V'as important to me just then. 
Random can be good at such 
things when he wants to. 

I drummed the side of the desk 
with my fingertips, I rubbed my 
aching shoulder, I uncrossed and 
recrossed my legs, I debated 
lighting a cigarette. 

Suddenly, he was there. At the 
far end of the room, Gerard had 
turned to his left, said something 
and extended his hand. An instant 
later, he was clasping the left and 
only hand of Benedict, the final 
member of our group. 

All right. The fact that Benedict 
had chosen to come in on 
Gerard’s Trump rather than mine 
was his way of expressing his feel- 
ings toward me. Was it also an 
indication of an alliance to keep 
me in check? It was at least calcu- 
lated to make me wonder. Could 
it have been Benedict who had 
put Gerard up to our morning’s 
exercise? Quite possibly. 

At that moment, Julian rose to 
his feet, crossed the room, gave 
Benedict a word and a handclasp. 
This activity attracted Llewella. 
She turned, closing her book and 
laying it aside. Smiling then, she 
advanced and greeted Benedict, 
nodded to Julian, said something 
to Gerard. The impromptu con- 
ference warmed, grew animated. 
All right again, and again. 

Four and three. And two in the 
middle. 



I waited, staring at the group 
across the room. We were all pres- 
ent, and I could have asked them 
for attention and proceeded with 
what I had in mind. However. , . 

It was too tempting. All of us 
could feel the tension, I knew. It 
was as if a pair of magnetic poles 
had suddenly been activated 
within the room. I was curious to 
see how all the filings would fall. 

Flora gave me one quick 
glance. I doubted she had 
changed her mind overnight 
— unless, of course, there had 
been some new development. No, 
I felt confident that I had antici- 
pated the next move. 

Nor was I incorrect. I over- 
heard her mentioning thirst and a 
glass of wine. She turned partway 
and made a move in my direction, 
as if expecting Fiona to accom- 
pany her. She hesitated a moment 
when this did not occur, suddenly 
became the focus of the entire 
company’s attention, realized this 
fact, made a quick decision, 
smiled and moved in my direc- 
tion. 

“Corwin,” she said, “I believe I 
would like a glass of wine.” 

Without turning my head or 
removing my gaze from the tab- 
leau before me, I called back over 
my shoulder, “Random, pour 
Flora a glass of wine, would you?” 

“But of course,” he replied, and 
I heard the necessary sounds. 

Flora nodded, unsmiled and 
passed beyond me to the right. 

Four and four, leaving dear 
Fiona burning brightly in the 
middle of the room. Totally self- 
conscious and enjoying it, she 
turned immediately toward the 



108 GALAXY 




oval mirror with the dark, intri- 
cately carved frame, hanging in 
the space between the two 
nearest tiers of shelves. She pro- 
ceeded to adjust a stray strand of 
hair in the vicinity of her left 
temple. 

Her movement produced a 
flash of green and silver among 
the red and gold geometries of 
the carpet, near to the place 
where her left foot had rested. 

I had simultaneous desires to 
curse and to smile. The arrant 
bitch was playing games with us 
again. Always remarkable, 
though. Nothing had changed. 
Neither cursing nor smiling, I 
moved forward, as she had known 
I would. 

But Julian, too, approached, 
and a trifle more quickly than I. 
He had been a bit nearer, may 
have spotted it a fraction of an in- 
stant sooner. 

He scooped it up and dangled 
it gently. 

“Your bracelet, sister,” he said 
pleasantly, “It seems to have 
forsaken your wrist, foolish thing. 
— Here. Allow me.” 

She extended her hand, giving 
him one of those lowered-eyelasn 
smiles while he refastened her 
chain of emeralds. Completing 
the business, he folded her hand 
within both of his own and began 
to turn back toward his corner, 
from whence the others were cast- 
ing sidelong glances while at- 
tempting to seem locally oc- 
cupied. 

‘I believe you would be 
amused by a witticism we are 
about to share — ” he began. 

Her smile grew even more de- 



lightful as she disengaged her 
hand. 

“Thank you, Julian,” she re- 
lied. “I am certain that when I 
ear it I will laugh. Last, as usual, 
I fear.” She turned and took my 
arm. “I find that I feel a greater 
desire,” she said, “for a glass of 
wine.” 

So I took her back with me and 
saw her refreshed. Five and four. 

Julian, who dislikes showing 
strong feelings, reached a decision 
a few moments later and followed 
us over. He poured himself a 
glass, sipped from it, studied me 
for ten or fifteen seconds, then 
said, “I believe we are all present 
now. When do you plan proceed- 
ing with whatever you nave in 
mind?” 

“I see no reason for further de- 
lay,” I said, “now that everyone 
has had his turn.” I raised my 
voice then and directed it across 
the room. “The time has come. 
Let us get comfortable.” 

The others drifted over. Chairs 
were dragged up and settled into. 
More wine was poured. A minute 
later we had an audience. 

“Thank you,” I said when the 
final stirrings had subsided. “I 
have a number of things I would 
like to say, and some of them 
might even get said. The course 
of it all will depend on what goes 
before, and we will get into that 
right now. Random, tell them 
what you told me yesterday.” 

“All right.” 

I withdrew to the seat behind 
the desk arid Random moved to 
occupy the edge of it. I leaned 
back and listened again to the 
story of his communication with 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



109 




Brand and his attempt to rescue 
him. It was a condensed version, 
bereft of the speculations which 
had not really strayed from my 
consciousness since Random had 
put them there. And despite their 
omission, a tacit awareness of the 
implications was occurring within 
all the others. I knew that. It was 
the main reason I had wanted 
Random to speak first. Had I 
simply come out with an attempt 
to make a case for my suspicions, 
1 would almost certainly have 
been assumed to be engaged in 
the time-honored practice of di- 
recting attention away from 
myself — an act to be followed 
immediately by the separate, 
sharp, metallic clicks of minds 
snapping shut against me. This 
way, despite any thoughts that 
Random would say whatever I 
wanted him to say, they would 
hear him out, wondering the 
while. They would toy with the 
ideas, attempting to foresee the 
point of my having called the as- 
sembly in the first place. They 
would allow die time that would 
permit the premises to take root 
contingent upon later corrobora- 
tion. And they would be wonder- 
ing whether we could produce the 
evidence. I was wondering that 
same thing myself. 

While I waited and wondered I 
watched the others, a fruitless yet 
inevitable exercise. Simple curios- 
ity, more than suspicion even, re- 
quired that I search these faces 
for reactions, clues, indications 
— the faces that I knew better 
than any others, to the limits of 
my understanding such things. 
And of course they told me noth- 



ing. Perhaps it is true that you 
really only look at a person the 
first time that you see him, and 
after that you do a quick bit of 
mental shorthand each time that 
you recognize him. My brain is 
lazy enough to give that its likeli- 
hood, using its abstracting powers 
and a presumption of regularity to 
avoid work whenever possible. 
This time I forced myself to see 
though, and it still did not help. 
Julian maintained his slightly 
bored, slightly amused mask. 
Gerard appeared alternately sur- 
prised, angry and wistful. Ben- 
edict just looked bleak and sus- 
picious. Llewella seemed as sad 
and inscrutable as ever. Deirdre 
looked distracted. Flora acquies- 
cent and Fiona was studying 
everyone else, myself included, 
assembling her own catalogue of 
reactions. 

The only thing that I could tell, 
after some time, was that Random 
was making an impression. While 
no one betrayed himself, I saw 
the boredom vanish, the old sus- 
picion abate, the new suspicion 
come to life. Interest rose among 
my kin. Fascination, almost. Then 
everyone had questions. At first a 
few, then a barrage. 

“Wait,” I finally interrupted. 
“Let him finish. The whole thing. 
Some of these will answer them- 
selves. Get the others after- 
wards.” 

There were nods and growls, 
and Random proceeded through 
to the real end. That is, he car- 
ried it on to our fight with the 
beastmen at Flora’s, indicating 
that they were of the same ilk as 
the one who had slain Caine. 



110 



GALAXY 




Flora endorsed this part. 

Then, when the questions 
came, I watched them carefully. 
So long as they dealt with the 
matter of Random’s story, they 
were all to the good. But I 
wanted to cut things short of 
speculation as to the possibility of 
one of us being behind it all. As 
soon as that came out, talk of me 
and the smell of red herring 
would also drift in. This could 
lead to ugly words and the 
emergence of a mood I was not 
anxious to engender. Better to go 
for the proof first, save on later 
recriminations, corner the culprit 
right now if possible and consoli- 
date my position on the spot. 

So I watched and waited. When 
I felt that the vital moment had 
ticked its way too near I stopped 
the clock. 

“None of this discussion, this 
speculation, would be necessary,” 
I said, “if we had all of the facts 
right now. And there may be a 
way to get them — right now. That 
is why you are here. 

That did it. I had them. Atten- 
tive. Ready. Maybe even willing. 

“I propose we attempt to reach 
Brand and bring him home,” I 
said, “now.” 

“How?” Benedict asked me. 

“The Trumps.” 

“It has been tried,” said Julian. 
“He cannot be reached that way. 
No response.” 

“I was not referring to the or- 
dinary usage,” I said. “I asked 
you all to bring full sets of 
Trumps with you. I trust that you 
have them?” 

There were nods. 

“Good,” I said. “Let us shuffle 



out Brand’s Trump now. I pro- 
pose that all nine of us attempt to 
contact him simultaneously.” 

“An interesting thought,” Ben- 
edict said. 

“Yes,” Julian agreed, producing 
his deck and riffling through it. 
“Worth trying, at least. It may 
generate additional power. I do 
not really know.” 

I located Brand’s Trump. I 
waited until all the others had 
found it. Then, “Let us coordinate 
things,” I said. “Is everyone 
ready?” 

Eight assents were spoken. 
“Then go ahead. Try. Now.” 

I studied my card. Brand’s fea- 
tures were similar to my own, but 
he was shorter and slenderer. His 
hair was like Fiona’s. He wore a 
green riding suit. He rode a white 
horse. How long ago? How long 
ago was that? I wondered. Some- 
thing of a dreamer, a mystic, a 

f »oet. Brand was always disil- 
usioned or elated, cynical or 
wholly trusting. His feelings 
never seemed to find a middle 
ground. Manic-depressive is too 
facile a term for his complex 
character, yet might serve to indi- 
cate a direction of departure, mul- 
titudes of qualifications lining the 
roadway thereafter. Pursuant to 
this state of affairs, I must admit 
that there were times when I 
found him so charming, consider- 
ate and loyal that I valued him 
above all my other kin. Other 
times, however, he could be so 
bitter, sarcastic and downright 
savage that I tried to avoid his 
company for fear I might do him 
harm. Summing up, the last time 
that I had seen him had been one 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



111 




of the latter occasions, just a bit 
before Eric and I had had the fall- 
ing out that led to my exile from 
Amber. 

.... And those were my 
thoughts and feelings as I studied 
his Trump, reaching out to him 
with my mind, my will, opening 
the vacant place I sought him to 
fill. About me, the others shuffled 
their own memories and did the 
same. 

Slowly, the card took on a 
dream-dust quality and acquired 
the illusion of depth. There fol- 
lowed that familiar blurring, with 
the sense of movement which 
heralds contact with the subject. 
The Trump grew colder beneath 
my fingertips, and then things 
flowed and formed, achieving a 
sudden verity of vision, persis- 
tent, dramatic, full. 

He seemed to be in a cell. 
There was a stone wall behind 
him. There was straw on the 
floor. He was manacled, and his 
chain ran back through a huge 
ring bolt set in the wall above and 
behind him. ft was a fairly long 
chain, providing sufficient slack 
for movement, and at the moment 
he was taking advantage of this 
fact, lying sprawled on a heap of 
straw ana rags, off in the corner. 
His hair ana beard were quite 
long, his face thinner than I had 
ever before seen it. His clothes 
were tattered and filthy. He 
seemed to be sleeping. My mind 
went back to my own 
imprisonment — the smells, the 
cold, the wretched fare, the 
dampness, the loneliness, the 
madness that came and went. At 
least he still had his eyes, for they 

112 



flickered and I saw them when 
several of us spoke his name: 
green they were, with a flat, va- 
cant look. 

Was he drugged? Or did he be- 
lieve himself to be hallucinating? 

But suddenly his spirit re- 
turned. He raised himself. He ex- 
tended his hand. 

“Brothers!” he said. 
“Sisters. .” 

“I’m coming!” came a shout 
that shook the room. 

Gerard had leaped to his feet, 
knocking over nis chair. He 
dashed across the room and 
snatched a great battle axe from 
its pegs on the wall. He slung it 
at his wirst, holding the Trump in 
that same hand. For a moment he 
froze, studying the card. Then he 
extended his free hand and sud- 
denly he was there, clasping 
Brand, who chose that moment to 
pass out again. The image wa- 
vered. The contact was broken. 

Cursing, I sought through the 
pack after Gerard’s own Trump. 
Several of the others seemed to 
be doing the same thing. Locating 
it, I moved for contact. Slowly, 
the melting, the turning, the 
re-forming occurred. There! 

Gerard had drawn the chain 
taut across the stones of the wall 
and was attacking it with the axe. 
It was a heavy thing, however, 
and resisted his powerful blows 
for a long while. Eventually, sev- 
eral of the links were mashed and 
scarred, but by then he had been 
at it for almost two minutes, and 
the ringing, chopping sounds had 
alerted the jailers. 

For there were noises from the 
left — a rattling sound, the sliding 

GALAXY 




of bolts, the creaking of hinges. 
Although my field of perception 
did not extend that far, it seemed 
obvious that the cell’s door was 
being opened. Brand raised him- 
self once more. Gerard continued 
to hack at the chain. 

“Gerard! The door!” I shouted. 

“I know!” he bellowed, wrap- 
ping the chain about his arm and 
yanking it. It did not yield. 

Then he let go the chain and 
swung the axe, as one of the 
horny handed warriors rushed 
him, blade upraised. The 
swordsman fell, to be replaced by 
another. Then a third and a fourth 
crowded by them. Others were 
close on their heels. 

There was a blur of movement 
at that moment and Random knelt 
within the tableau, his right hand 
clasped with Brand’s, his left 
holding his chair before him like a 
shield, its legs pointing outward. 
He sprang to his feet and rushed 
the attackers, driving the chair like 
a battering ram into their midst. 
They fell back. He raised the 
chair and swung it. One lay dead 
on the floor, fallen to Gerard’s 
axe. Another had drawn off to one 
side, clutching at the stump of his 
right arm. Random produced a 
dagger and left it in a nearby 
stomach, brained two more with 
the chair and drove the final man 
back. Eerily, while this was going 
on, the dead man rose above the 
floor and slowly drifted upward, 
spilling and dripping the while. 
The one who had been stabbed 
collapsed to his knees, clutching at 
the blade. 

In the meantime, Gerard had 
taken hold of the chain with both 



hands. He braced one foot against 
the wall and commenced to pull. 
His shoulders rose as the great 
muscles tightened across his back. 
The chain held. Ten seconds, 
perhaps. Fifteen. 

Then, with a snap and a rattle, 
it parted. Gerard stumbled back- 
ward, catching himself with an 
outflung hand. He glanced back, 
apparently at Random, who was 
out of my line of sight at the mo- 
ment. Seemingly satisfied, he 
turned away, stooped and raised 
Brand, who had fallen uncon- 
scious again. Holding him in his 
arms, he turned and extended 
one hand from beneath the limp 
form. Random leaped back into 
sight beside them, sans chair, and 
gestured to us also. 

All of us reached for them, and 
a moment later they stood in our 
midst and we crowded round. 

A sort of cheer had gone up as 
we rushed to touch him, to see 
him, our brother who had been 
gone these many years and just 
now snatched back from his mys- 
terious captors. And at last, hope- 
fully, finally, some answers might 
also have been liberated. Only he 
looked so weak, so thin, so 
pale. 

“Get back!” Gerard shouted. 
“I’m taking him to the couch! 
Then you can look all you — ” 

Dead silence. For everyone had 
backed off, and then turned to 
stone. This was because there was 
blood on Brand, and it was drip- 
ping. And this was because there 
was a knife in his left side, to the 
rear. It had not been there mo- 
ments before. Some one of us had 
just tried for his kidney and pos-

sibly succeeded. I was not heart- 
ened by the fact that the 
Random-Corwin Conjecture that 
it was One Of Us Behind It All 
had just received a significant 
boost. I had an instant during 
which to concentrate all my facul- 
ties in an attempt to mentally 
photograph everyone’s position. 
Then the spell was broken. 
Gerard bore Brand to the couch 
and we drew aside; and we all 
knew that we all realized not only 
what had happened, but what it 
implied. 

Gerard set Brand down in a 
prone position and tore away his 
filthy shirt. 

“Get me clean water, to bathe 
him,” he said. “And towels. Get 
me saline solution and glucose 
and something to . hang them 
from. Get me a whole medical 
kit.” 

Deirdre and Flora moved to- 
ward the door. 

“My quarters are closest,” said 
Random. “One of you will find a 
medical kit there. But the onlv IV 
stuff is in the lab on the third 
floor. I’d better come and help.” 

They departed together. 

We had all had medical training 
somewhere along the line, both 
here and abroad. That which we 
learned in Shadow though, had to 
be modified in Amber. Most an- 
tibiotics from the shadow worlds, 
for example, were ineffectual 
here. On the other hand, our per- 
sonal immunological processes 
appear to behave differently from 
those of any other peoples we 
have studied, so that it is much 
more difficult for us to become 
infected — and, if infected, we deal 



with it more expeditiously. Then, 
too, we possess profound re- 
generative abilities. 

All of which is as it must be, of 
course, the ideal necessarily being 
superior to its shadows. Ana 
Amberites that we are, and aware 
of these facts from an early age, 
all of us obtained medical training 
relatively soon in life. Basically, 
despite what is often said about 
being your own physician, it goes 
back to our not unjustified dis- 
trust of virtually everyone, and 
most particularly those who might 
hold our lives in their hands. All 
of which partly explains why I did 
not rush to shoulder Gerard aside 
to undertake Brand’s treatment 
myself, despite the fact that I had 
been through a med school on the 
shadow Earth within the past 
couple generations. The other 
part of the explanation is that 
Gerard was not letting anyone 
else near Brand. Julian and Fiona 
had both moved forward, appar- 
ently with the same thing in 
mind, only to encounter Gerard’s 
left arm like a gate at a railway 
crossing. 

“No,” he had said. “I know that 
I did not do it, and that is all that 
I know. There will be no second 
chance for anyone else.” 

With any one of us sustaining 
that sort of wound while in an 
otherwise sound condition, I 
would say that if he made it 
through the first half hour he 
would make it. Brand, though. 
The shape he was in. There 
was no telling. 

When the others returned with 
the materials and equipment, 
Gerard cleaned Brand, sutured 



114 



GALAXY 




the wound and dressed it. He 
hooked up the IV, broke off the 
manacles with a hammer and 
chisel Random had located, co- 
vered Brand with a sheet and a 
blanket and took his pulse again. 

“How is it?” I asked. 

“Weak,” he said, and he drew 
up a chair and seated himself be- 
side the couch. “Someone fetch 
me my blade — and a glass of 
wine. I didn’t have any. Also, if 
there is any food left over there, 
I’m hungry.” 

Llewella headed for the 
sideboard and Random got him 
his blade from the rack behind 
the door. 

“Are you just going to camp 
there?” Random asked, passing 
him the weapon. 

“I am.” 

“What about moving Brand to a 
better bed?” 

“He is all right where he is. I 
will decide when he can be 
moved. In the meantime, some- 
one get a fire going. Then put out 
a few of those candles.” 

Random nodded. 

“I’ll do it,” he said. Then he 
picked up the knife Gerard had 
drawn from Brand’s side, a thin 
stiletto, its blade about seven inch- 
es in length. He held it across 
the palm of his hand. 

“Does anyone recognize this?” 
he asked. 

"Not I,” said Benedict. 

“Nor I,” said Julian. 

“No,” I said. 

The girls shook their heads. 

Random studied it. 

“Easily concealed — up a sleeve, 
in a boot or bodice. It took real 
nerve to use it that way. .” 



“Desperation,” I said. 

”... .And a very accurate an- 
ticipation of our mob scene. In- 
spired, almost.” 

“Could one of the guards have 
done it?” Julian asked. “Back in 
the cell?” 

“No,” Gerard said. “None of 
them came near enough.” 

“It looks to be decently bal- 
anced for throwing,” Deirdre 
said. 

“It is,” said Random, shifting it 
about his fingertips. “Only none 
of them had a clear shot or the 
opportunity. I’m positive.” 

Llewella returned, bearing a 
tray containing slabs of meat, naif 
a loaf of bread, a bottle of wine 
and a goblet. I cleared a small 
table and set it beside Gerard’s 
chair. As Llewella deposited the 
tray, she asked, “But why? That 
only leaves us. Why would one of 
us want to do it?” 

I sighed. 

“Whose prisoner do you think 
he might have been?” I asked. 

“One of us?” 

“If he possessed knowledge 
someone was willing to go to this 
length to suppress, what do you 
think? The same reason also 
served to put him where he was 
and keep him there.” 

Her brows tightened. 

“That does not make sense 
either. Why didn’t they just kill 
him and be done with it?” 

Must have had some use for 
him,” I said. “But there is really 
only one person who can answer 
that question adequately. When 
you find him, ask him.” 

“Or her,” Julian said. “Sister, 
you seem possessed of a 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



115 




superabundance of naivete, sud- 
denly.” 

Her gaze locked with Julian’s 
own, a pair of icebergs reflecting 
frigid infinities. 

‘As I recall,” she said, “you 
rose from your seat when they 
came through, turned to the left, 
rounded the desk and stood 
slightly to Gerard s right. You 
leaned pretty far forward. I be- 
lieve your hands were out of 
sight, below.” 

“. And as I recall,” he said, 
“you were within striking distance 
yourself, off to Gerard’s left — and 
leaning forward.” 

“I would have had to do it with 
my left hand — and 1 am right- 
handed. 7 

“Perhaps he owes what life he 
still possesses to that fact.” 

“You seem awfully anxious, 
Julian, to find that it was someone 
else.” 

“All right,” 1 said. “All right! 
You know this is self-defeating. 
Only one of us did it, and this is 
not the way to smoke him out.” 

“. Or her,” Julian added. 

Gerard rose, towered, glared. 

“I will not have you disturbing 
my patient,” he said. “And Ran- 
dom, you said you were going to 
see to the fire.” 

“Right away,” Random said, 
and moved to do it. 

“Let us adjourn to the sitting 
room off the main hall,” I said, 
“downstairs. —Gerard, I will post 
a couple guards outside the door 
here.’ 

“No,” Gerard said. “I would 
rather that anyone who wishes to 
try it get this far. I will hand you 
his head in the morning.” 



I nodded. 

“Well, you can ring for any- 
thing you need — or call one of us 
on the Trumps. We will fill you in 
in the morning on anything that 
we learn.” 

“Gerard seated himself, 
runted and began eating. Ran- 
om got the fire going and extin- 
uished some lights. Brand’s 
lanket rose and fell, slowly but 
regularly. We filed quietly from 
the room and headed for the 
stairway, leaving them there to- 
gether with the flare and the 
crackle, the tubes and the bottles. 

VII. 

Many are the times I have 
awakened, sometimes shaking, 
always afraid, from the dream that 
I occupied my old cell, blind once 
more, in the dungeons beneath 
Amber. It is not as if I were un- 
familiar with the condition of im- 
prisonment. I have been locked 
away on a number of occasions, 
for various periods of time. But 
solitary, plus blindness with small 
hope of recovery, made for a big 
charge at the sensory deprivation 
counter in the department store 
of the mind. That, with the sense 
of finality to it all, had left its 
marks. I generally keep these 
memories safely tucked away dur- 
ing waking hours, but at night, 
sometimes, they come loose, 
dance down the aisles and frolic 
round the notions counter, one, 
two, three. Seeing Brand there in 
his cell had brought them out 
again, along with an unseasonal 
chill; and that final thrust served 
to establish a more or less perma- 



116 



GALAXY 




nent residence for them. Now, 
among my kin in the shield-hung 
sitting room, I could not avoid the 
thought that one or more of them 
had done unto Brand as Eric had 
done unto me. While this capacity 
was in itself hardly a surprising 
discovery, the matter of occupy- 
ing the same room with the cul- 
prit and having no idea as to his 
identity was more than a little dis- 
turbing. My only consolation was 
that each of the others, according 
to his means, must be disturbed 
also. Including the guilty party, 
now that the existence theorem 
had shown a positive. I knew then 
that I had been hoping all along 
that outsiders were entirely to 
blame. Now, though. On the 
one hand, I felt even more re- 
stricted than usual in what I could 
say. On the other, it seemed a 
good time to press for informa- 
tion, with everyone in an abnor- 
mal state of mind. The desire to 
cooperate for purposes of dealing 
with the threat could prove help- 
ful. And even the guilty party 
would want to behave the same as 
everyone else. Who knew but 
that he might slip up while mak- 
ing the effort? 

“Well, have you any other in- 
teresting little experiments you 
would care to conduct?” Julian 
asked me, clasping his hands be- 
hind his head and leaning back in 
my favorite chair. 

“Not at the moment,”. I said. 

“Pity,” he replied. “I was hop- 
ing you would suggest we go look- 
ing for Dad now in the same fash- 
ion. Then, if we are lucky, we 
find him and someone puts him 
out of the way with more cer- 



tainty. After that, we could all 
lay Russian Roulette with those 
fine new weapons you’ve 
furnished — winner take all.’ 

“Your words are ill-considered,” 
I said. 

“Not so. I considered every one 
of them,” he answered. “We 
spend so much time lying to one 
another that I decided it might be 
amusing to say what I really felt. 
Just to see whether anyone 
noticed.” 

"Now you see that we have. 
We also notice that the real you is 
no improvement over the old 
one.” 

“Whichever you prefer, both of 
us have been wondering whether 
you have any idea what you are 
going to do next. ” 

“I do,” I said. “I now intend to 
obtain answers to a number of 

S uestions dealing with everything 
lat is plaguing us. We might as 
well start with Brand and his 
troubles.” Turning toward Ben- 
edict, who was sitting gazing 
into the fire, I said, “Back in Av- 
alon, Benedict, you told me that 
Brand was one of the ones who 
searched for me after my disap- 
pearance. ” 

“That is correct,” Benedict 
answered. 

“All of us went looking,” Julian 
said. 

“Not at first, I replied. “Ini- 
tially, it was Brand, Gerard and 
yourself, Benedict. Isn’t that what 
you told me?” 

“Yes,” he said. “The others did 
have a go at it later, though. I 
told you that, too.” 

I nodded. 

“Did Brand report anything 

117 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 




unusual at that time?” I asked him. 

“Unusual? In what way?” said 
Benedict. 

“I don’t know. I am looking for 
some connection between what 
happened to him and what hap- 
pened to me.” 

“Then you are looking in the 
wrong place,” Benedict said. “He 
returned and reported no success. 
And he was around for ages after 
that, unmolested.” 

“I gathered that much,” I said. 
“I understand from what Random 
has told me, though, that his final 
disappearance occured approxi- 
mately a month before my own 
recovery and return. That almost 
strikes me as peculiar. If he did 
not report anything special after 
his return from the search, did he 
do so prior to his disappearance? 
Or in the interim? — Anyone? 
Anything? Say it if you’ve got it!” 

There followed some mutual 
glancing about. The looks seemed 
more curious than suspicious or 
nervous, though. 

Finally, then, “Well,” Llewella 
said, “I do not know. Do npt 
know whether it is significant, I 
mean.” 

All eyes came to rest upon her. 
She began to knot and unknot the 
ends of her belt cord, slowly, as 
she spoke. 

“It was in the interim, and it 
may have no bearing,” she went 
on. “It is just something that 
struck me as peculiar. Brand 
came to Rebma long ago — ” 

“How long ago?” I asked. 

She furrowed her brow. 

“Fifty, sixty, seventy years. I 
am not certain. .” 

I tried to summon up the rough 



conversion factor I had worked 
out during my long incarceration. 
A day in Amber, it seemed, con- 
stituted a bit over two and a half 
days on the shadow Earth where I 
had spent my exile. I wanted to 
relate events in Amber to my own 
time-scale whenever possible, just 
in case any peculiar correspon- 
dences turned up. So Brand went 
to Rebma sometime in what was, 
to me, the nineteenth century. 

“Whatever the date,” she said, 
“he came and visited me. Stayed 
for several weeks.” She glanced at 
Random then. “He was asking 
about Martin.” 

Random narrowed his eyes and 
cocked his head. 

“Did he say why?” he asked 
her. 

“Not exactly,” she said. “He 
implied that he had met Martin, 
somewhere, in his travels, and he 
gave the impression that he would 
like to get in touch with him 
again. I aid not realize until some 
time after his departure that find- 
ing out everything he could con- 
cerning Martin was probably the 
entire reason for his visit. You 
know how subtle Brand can be, 
finding out things without seem- 
ing to be after them. It was only 
after I had spoken with a number 
of others whom he had visited 
that I began to see what had oc- 
curred. I never did find out why, 
though.” 

“Tnat is — most peculiar. .” 
Random observed. “For it brings 
to mind something to which I had 
never attached any significance. 
He once questioned me at great 
length concerning my son — and it 
may well have been at about that 



118 



GALAXY 




same time. He never indicated 
that he had met him, however 
— or that he had any desire to do 
so. It started out as a bit of banter 
on the subject of bastards. When 
I took offense he apologized and 
asked a number of more proper 
questions about the boy, whicn I 
assumed he then put for the sake 
of politeness — to leave me with a 
softer remembrance. As you say, 
though, he had a way of drawing 
admissions from people. — Why is 
it you never told me of this be- 
fore?” 

She smiled prettily. 

“Why should I have?” she said. 

Random nodded slowly, his face 
expressionless. 

‘Well, what did you tell him?” 
he said. “What did he learn? 
What do you know about Martin 
that I don t?” 

She shook her head, her smile 
fading. 

“Nothing — actually,” she said. 
“To my knowledge, no one in 
Rebma ever heard from Martin 
after he took the Pattern and van- 
ished. I do not believe that Brand 
departed knowing any more than 
when he arrived. 

“Strange. .” I said. “Did he 
approach anyone else on the sub- . 
ject?” 

“I don’t remember,” Julian 
said. 

“Nor I,” said Benedict. 

The others shook their heads. 

“Then let us note it and leave it 
for now,” I said. “There are other 
things I also need to know. 
— Julian, I understand that you 
and Gerard attempted to follow 
the black road awhile back, and 
that Gerard vya s injured along the 



way. I believe you both stayed 
with Benedict for a time after 
that, while Gerard recuperated. I 
would like to know about that ex- 
pedition.” 

“It seems as if you already do,” 
Julian replied. “You have just 
stated everything that occurred.” 

“Where did you learn of this, 
Corwin?” Benedict inquired. 

“Back in Avalon,” I said. 

“From whom?” 

“Dara,” I said. 

He rose to his feet, came over, 
stood before me, glared down. 

“You still persist in that absurd 
story — about the girl!” 

I sighed. 

“We have been round and 
round on this too many times,” I 
said. “By now I have told you ev- 
erything that I know on the sub- 
ject. Either you accept it or you 
do not. She is the one who told 
me, though.” 

“Apparently then there were 
some things you did not tell me. 
You never mentioned that part 
before.” 

“ “Is it true or isn’t it? About 
Julian and Gerard.” 

“It is true,” he said. 

“Then forget the source for now 
and let us get on with what hap- 
pened.” 

“Agreed,” Benedict said. “I 
may speak candidly, now that the 
reason for secrecy is no longer 
with us. Eric, of course. He was 
unaware of my whereabouts, as 
were most of the others. Gerard 
was my main source of news in 
Amber. Eric grew more and more 
apprehensive concerning the 
black road and finally decided to 
send scouts to trace it through 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



119 




Shadow to its source. Julian and 
Gerard were selected. They were 
attacked by a very strong party of 
its creatures at a point near Av- 
alon. Gerard called to me, via my 
Trump, for assistance and I went 
to their aid. The enemy was dis- 
patched. As Gerard had sustained 
a broken leg in the fighting and 
Julian was a bit battered himself, 
I took them both home with me. 
I broke my silence with Eric at 
that time, to tell him where they 
were and what had become of 
them. He ordered them not to 
continue their journey, but to re- 
turn to Amber after they had re- 
covered. They remained with me 
until they did. Then they went 
back.” 

‘‘That is all?” 

“That is all.” 

But it wasn’t. Dara had also 
told me something else. She had 
mentioned another visitor. I re- 
membered it quite distinctly. 
That day, beside the stream, a 
tiny rainbow in the mist above 
the waterfall, the mill wheel turn- 
ing round and round, delivering 
dreams and grinding them, that 
day we had fenced and talked and 
walked in Shadow, had passed 
through a primordial wood, com- 
ing to a spot beside a mighty tor- 
rent where turned a wheel fit for 
the granary of the gods, that day 
we had picnicked, flirted, gos- 
siped, she had told me many 
things, some of them doubtless 
false. But she had not lied con- 
cerning the journey of Julian and 
Gerard, and I believed it possible 
that she had also spoken truly 
when she said that Brand had vis- 
ited Benedict in Avalon. “Fre- 

120 



quently” was the word she had 
used. 

Now, Benedict made no secret 
of the fact that he distrusted me. 

I could see this alone as sufficient 
reason for his withholding infor- 
mation on anything he judged too 
sensitive to become my business. 
Hell, buying his story, I would 
not have trusted me either if our 
situations were reversed. Only a 
fool would have called him on it 
at that moment, though. Because 
or the other possibilities. 

It could be that he planned to 
tell me later, in private, of 
the circumstances surrounding 
Brand’s visits. They could well 
have involved something he did 
not wish to discuss before the 
group, and especially before 
Brand’s would-be killer. 

Or — There was, of course, the 
possibility that Benedict himself 
was behind it all. I did not even 
like to think about the conse- 
quences. Having served under 
Napoleon, Lee and MacArthur, I 
appreciated the tactician as well 
as the strategist. Benedict was 
both, and he was the best I had 
ever known. The recent loss of his 
right arm had in no way di- 
minished him in this, or for that 
matter impaired his personal 
fighting skills. Had I not been 
very lucky recently he could eas- 
ily have turned me into a pile of 
scallops over our misunderstand- 
ing. No, I did not want it to be 
Benedict, and I was not about to 
grope after whatever he had, at 
that moment, seen fit to conceal. 

I only hoped that he was just sav- 
ing it for later. 

So I settled for his, “That is 

GALAXY 




all,” and decided to move on to 
other matters. 

“Flora,’' I said, “back when I 
first visited you, after my acci- 
dent, you said something which 1 
still do not quite understand. In 
that I had ample time relatively 
soon thereafter in which to review 
many things, I came across it in 
my memories and occasionally 
puzzled over it. I still do not un- 
derstand it. So would you please 
tell me what you meant when you 
said that the shadows contained 
more horrors than any had 
thought?” 

“Why, I do not properly recall 
saying it,” Flora said. “But I sup- 
pose that I must have, if it made 
such an impression. You know the 
effect that I was referring to: that 
Amber seems to act as something 
of a magnet on adjacent shadows, 
drawing things across from them; 
the nearer you get to Amber the 
easier the road becomes, even for 
shadow-things. While there al- 
ways seems to be some exchange 
of materials among adjacent 
shadows themselves, the effect is 
more forceful and also more of a 
one-way process when it comes to 
Amber. We have always been 
alert for peculiar things slipping 
through. Well, for several years 
prior to your recovery, more such 
things than usual seemed to be 
showing up in the vicinity of 
Amber. Dangerous things, almost 
invariably. Many were recogniza- 
ble creatures from nearby realsm. 
After a time though, things kept 
coming in from farther and farther 
afield. Eventually, some which 
were totally unknown made it 
through. No reason could be 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



found. for this sudden transporta- 
tion of menaces, although we 
sought fairly far for disturbances 
which might be driving them this 
way. In other words, highly im- 
probable penetrations of Shadow 
were occurring.” 

“This actually began while Dad 
was still around?” 

“Oh, yes. It started several 
years before your recovery — as I 
said.” 

“I see. Did anyone consider the 
possibility of there being a con- 
nection between this state of af- 
fairs and Dad’s departure?” 

“Certainly,” Benedict replied. 
“I still feel that that was the 
reason for it. He went off to in- 
vestigate, or to seek a remedy.” 
“But that is purely conjecture,” 
Julian said. “You know how he 
was. He gave no reasons.” 
Benedict shrugged. 

“It is a reasonable inference, 
though,” he said. “I understand 
that be had spoken of his concern 
over the — monster migrations, if 
you like — on numerous occa- 
sions.” 

I withdrew my cards from their 
case, having recently gotten into 
the habit of carrying a set of 
Trumps with me at all times. I 
raised Gerard’s Trump and re- 
garded it. The others were silent, 
watching me as I did this. Mo- 
ments later, there was contact. 

Gerard was still seated in his 
chair, his blade across his knees. 
He was still eating. He swallowed 
when he felt my presence and 
said, “Yes, Corwin? What do you 
want?” 

“How is Brand?” 

“Sleeping,” he said. “His pulse 

121 




is a little stronger. His breathing 
is the same — regular. It’s still too 
early — ” 

“I know,” I said. “I mainly 
wanted to check your recollection 
of something? Near the end 
there, did you get the impression 
from anything he might have said 
or done that Dad’s going away 
might have been connected with 
the increased number of Shadow 
beings that were slipping through 
into Amber?” 

“That,” said Julian, “is what is 
known as a leading question.” 
Gerard wiped his mouth. 

“There could have been a con- 
nection, yes,” he said. “He 
seemed disturbed, preoccupied 
with something. And he did talk 
about the creatures. But he never 
really said that that was his main 
concern — or whether it was some- 
thing entirely different.” 

“Like what?” 

He shook his head. 

“Anything. I — Yes. Yes, 
there is something you probably 
ought to know, for whatever it is 
worth. Some time after his disap- 
pearance, I did make an effort to 
find out one thing. That was, 
whether I was indeed fhe last 
person to see him before his de- 
parture. I am fairly certain that I 
was. I had been there in the 
palace all evening, and I was pre- 
paring to return to the flagship. 
Dad nad retired about an hour 
earlier, but I had stayed on in the 
guard room, playing draughts 
with the Captain. As we were 
sailing the following morning, I 
decided to take a book with me. 
So I came up here to the library. 
Dad was seated at the desk.” He 

122 



gestured with his head. “He was 
going through some old books, 
and ne had not yet changed his 
garments. He nodded to me when 
I entered, and I told him I had 
just come up for a book. He said. 
You’ve come to the right place,’ 
and he kept on reading. While I 
was looking over the shelves, he 
said something to the effect that 
he could not sleep. I found a 
book, told him good night, he 
said, ‘Good sailing,’ and I left.” 
He lowered his eyes again. “Now 
I am positive he was wearing the 
Jewel of Judgment that night, that 
I saw it on him then as plainly as 
I see it on you now. I am equal- 
ly certain that he had not had it 
on earlier that evening. For a 
long while after, I thought that he 
had taken it along with him, 
wherever he went. There was no 
indication in his chambers that he 
had later changed his clothing. I 
never saw the stone again until 
you and Bleys were defeated in 
your assault on Amber. Then, 
Eric was wearing it. When I 
questioned him, he claimed that 
he had found it in Dad’s cham- 
bers. Lacking evidence to the 
contrary, I had to accept his 
story. But I was never happy with 
it. Your question — and seeing you 
wearing it — has brought it all 
back. So I thought you had 
better know about it.” 

“Thanks,” I said, and another 
question occurred to me but I de- 
cided against asking it at that 
moment. For the benefit of the 
others, I closed off by saying, “So 
do you think he needs any more 
blankets? Or anything else?” 
Gerard raised his glass to me. 

GALAXY 




“Very good. Keep up the good 
work,” I said, ana I passed my 
hand over his card. 

“Brother Brand seems to be 
doing all right,” I said, “and 
Gerard does not recollect Dad’s 
saying anything that would di- 
rectly connect Shadow slippage 
and his departure. I wonder how 
Brand will recall things, when he 
comes around?” 

“If he comes around,” Julian 
said. 

“I think that he will,” I said. 
“We have all taken some pretty 
had beatings and we are still 
around. Our vitality is one of the 
few things we have come to trust. 
My guess is that he will be talking 
by morning.” 

“What do you propose doing 
with the guilty party, he asked, 
“if Brand names nim?” 

“Question him,” I said. 

“Then I would like to do the 
questioning. I am beginning to 
leel you may he right this time, 
Corwin, and that the person who 
stabbed him may also be respon- 
sible for our intermittent state of 
seige, for Dad’s disappearance 
ana for Caine’s killing. So I would 
enjoy questioning him before we 
cut his thrtat, ana I would like to 
volunteer for that last part also. ” 

“We will keep it in mind,” I 
said. 

“You are not excluded from the 
reckoning, Corwin.” 

“I was aware of that.” 

“I have something to say,” said 
Benedict, smothering a rejoinder 
from Julian. “I find myself trou- 
bled both by the strength and the 
apparent objective of the opposi- 
tion. I have encountered tnem 



now on several occasions, and 
they are out for blood. Accepting 
for the moment your story of the 
irl Dara, Corwin, her final words 
o seem to sum up their attitude: 
‘Amber will be destroyed.’ Not 
conquered, subjugated or taught a 
lesson. Destroyed. — Julian, you 
wouldn’t mind ruling here, would 
you?” 

Julian smiled. 

“Perhaps next year this time,” 
he said. “Not today, thank you.” 

“What I am getting at is that I 
could see you — or any of us 
— employing mercenaries or ob- 
taining alllies to effect a takeover. 
I cannot see you employing a 
force so powerful that it would 
represent a grave problem itself 
afterwards. Not a force that seems 
bent on destruction rather than 
conquest. I cannot see you, me, 
Corwin, the others as actually try- 
ing to destroy Amber, or willing 
to gamble with forces that would. 
That is the part I do not like 
about Corwin’s notion that one of 
us is behind this.” 

I had to nod. I was not unaware 
of the weakness of that link in my 
chain of speculations. Still, there 
were so many unknowns. I 
could offer alternatives, such as 
Random then did, but guesses 
prove nothing. 

“It may be,” Random said, 
“that one of us made the deal, but 
underestimated his allies. The 
guilty party may now be sweating 
this thing as much as the rest of 
us. He may not be in a position to 
turn things off now, even if he 
wants to.” 

“We could offer him the pppor- 
tunity,” Fiona said, “to betray his 

123 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 




allies to us now. If Julian could be 
persuaded to leave his throat 
uncut and the rest of us were will- 
ing to do the same, he might 
come around — if Random’s guess 
is correct. He would not claim the 
throne, but he was obviously not 
about to have it before. He would 
have his life and he could save 
Amber quite a bit of trouble. Is 
anyone willing to commit himself 
to a position on this?” 

“I am,” I said. “I will give him 
his life if he will come across, 
with the understanding that it will 
be spent in exile.” 

“I will go along with that,” Ben- 
edict said. 

“So will I,” said Random. 

“On one condition,” Julian said. 
“If he was not personally respon- 
sible for Caine’s death, I will go 
along with it. Otherwise, no. And 
there would have to be evi- 
dence.” 

“Life, in exile,” Deirdre said. 
“All right. I agree.” 

“So do I,” said Flora. 

“And I,” Llewella followed. 

“Gerard will probably agree, 
too,” I said. “But I really wonder 
whether Brand will feel the same 
as the rest of us? I’ve a feeling he 
may not.” 

“Let us check with Gerard,” 
Benedict said. “If Brand makes it 
and proves the only holdout, the 
guilty party will know he has only 
one enemy to avoid — and they 
can always work out their own 
terms on that count.” 

“All right,” I said, smothering a 
few misgivings, and I recontacted 
Gerard, who agreed also. 

So we rose to our feet and 
swore that much by the Unicom 

124 



of Amber — Julian’s oath having an 
extra clause to it — and swore to 
enforce exile on any of our own 
number who violated the oath. 
Frankly, I did not think it would 
net us anything, but it is always 
nice to see families doing things 
together. 

After that, everyone made a 
point of mentioning that he would 
be remaining in tne palace over- 
night, presumably to indicate that 
no one feared anything Brand 
might have to say in the 
morning — and especially to indi- 
cate that no one had a desire to 
get out of town, a thing that 
would not be forgotten, even if 
Brand gave up the ghost during 
the night. In that I had no further 
questions to put to the group and 
no one had sprung forward to own 
up to the misdeeds covered by 
the oath, I leaned back and lis- 
tened for a time after that. Things 
came apart, falling into a series of 
conversations and exchanges, one 
of the main topics being an at- 
tempted reconstruction of the li- 
brary tableau, each of us in his own 
place and, invariably, why each of 
us was in a position to have done 
it, except for the speaker. I 
smoked; I said nothing on the 
subject. Deirdre did spot an in- 
teresting possibility, however. 
Namely, that Gerard could have 
done the stabbing himself while 
we were all crowded around, and 
that his heroic efforts were not 
prompted by any desire to save 
Brand’s neck, but rather to 
achieve a position where he could 
stop his tongue — in which case, 
Brand would never make it 
through the night. Ingenious, but 

GALAXY 




I just couldn’t believe it. No one 
else bought it either. At least, no 
one volunteered to go upstairs 
and throw Gerard out. 

After a time, Fiona drifted 
over, sat beside me. 

“Well, I’ve tried the only thing 
I could think of,”' she said. “I 
hope some good comes of it.” 

“It may,” I said. 

“I see that you have added a 
peculiar piece of ornamentation to 
your wardrobe,” she said, raising 
the Jewel between her thumb ana 
forefinger and studying it. 

Then she raised her eyes. 

“Can you make it do tricks for 
you?” she asked. 

“Some,” I said. 

“Then you knew how to attune 
it. It involves the Pattern, doesn’t 
it?” 

"Yes. Eric told me how to go 
about it, right before he died.” 

“I see.” 

She released it, settled back 
into her seat. 

“Did he give you any cautions 
to go along with it?” she asked. 

“No,” I said. 

“I wonder whether that was a 
matter of design or circum- 
stance?” 

“Well, he was pretty busy 
dying at the time. That limited 
our conversation considerably.” 

“I know. I was wondering 
whether his hatred for you out- 
weighed his hopes for the realm, 
or whether he was simply ignor- 
ant of some of the principles in- 
volved. ” 

“What do you know about it?” 

“Think again of Eric’s death, 
Corwin. I was not there when it 
occurred, but I came in early for 



the funeral. I was present when 
his body was bathed, shaved, 
dressed — and I examined his 
wounds. I do not believe that any 
of them were fatal, in themselves. 
There were three chest wounds, 
but only one looked as if it might 
have run into the mediastinal 
area — ” 

“One’s enough.” 

“Wait,” she said. “It was dif- 
ficult, but I tried judging the 
angle of the puncture with a thin 
glass rod. I wanted to make an in- 
cision, but Caine would not per- 
mit it. Still, I do not believe that 
his heart or arteries were dam- 
aged. It is still not too late to order 
an autopsy, if you would like me 
to check further on this. I am cer- 
tain that his injuries and the gen- 
eral stress contributed to his 
death, but I believe it was the 
Jewel that made the difference.” 
“Why do you think this?” 
“Because of some things that 
Dworkin said, when I studied 
with him — and things that I 
noticed afterwards, because of 
this. He indicated that while it 
conferred unusual abilities, it also 
represented a drain on the vitality 
of its master. The longer you wear 
it, the more it somehow takes out 
of you. I paid attention after that, 
and I noticed that Dad wore it 
only seldom and never kept it on 
for long periods of time.” 

My thoughts returned to Eric, 
the day he lay dying on the slopes 
of Kolvir, the battle raging about 
him. I remembered my first look 
at him, his face pale, his breath 
labored, blood on his chest. 
And the Jewel of Judgment, there 
on its chain, was pulsing, heart- 

125 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 




like, among the moist folds of his 
garments. I had never seen it do 
that before, or since. I recalled 
that the effect had grown fainter, 
weaker. And when ne died and I 
folded his hands atop it, the 
phenomenon had ceased. 

“What do yon know of its func- 
tion?” I asked her. 

She shook her head. 

“Dworkin considered that a 
state secret. I know the 
obvious — weather control— and I 
inferred from some of Dad’s re- 
marks that it has something to do 
with a heightened perception, or 
a higher perception. Dworkin 
had mentioned it primarily as an 
example of the pervasiveness of 
the Pattern in everything that 
gives us power — even the Trumps 
contain the Pattern, if you look 
closely, look long enough — and he 
cited it as an instance of a conser- 
vation principle: all of our special 
powers have their price. The great- 
er the power, the larger the in- 
vestment. The Trumps are a small 
matter, but there is still an ele- 
ment of fatigue involved in their 
employment. Walking through 
Shadow, which is an exercise of 
the image of the Pattern which 
exists within us, is an even great- 
er expenditure. To essay the Pat- 
tern itself, physically, is a massive 
drain on one’s energies. But the 

i ewel, he said, represents an even 
ligher octave of the same thing, 
and its cost to its employer is ex- 
ponentially greater.” 

Thus, if correct, another am- 
biguous insight into the character 
of my late and least favored 
brother. If he were aware of this 
phenomenon and had donned the 

126 



t ewel and worn it overlong any- 
iow, in the defense of Amber, it 
made hipi something of a hero. 
But then, seen in this light, his 
passing it along to me, without 
warnings, became a deathbed ef- 
fort at a final piece of vengeance. 
But he had exempted me from his 
curse, he’d said, so as to spend it 

H erly on our enemies in the 
, This, of course, only meant 
that he hated them a little more 
than he hated me and was deploy- 
ing his final energies as strategi- 
cally as possible, for Amber. I 
thought then of the partial charac- 
ter of Dworkin’s notes, as I had 
recovered them from the hiding 
lace Eric had indicated. Could it 
e that Eric had acquired them 
intact and had purposely de- 
stroyed that portion containing 
the cautions, so as to damn his 
successor? That notion did not 
strike me as quite correct, for he 
had had no way of knowing that I 
would return when I did, as I 
did, that the course of battle 
would run as it had, and that I 
would indeed be his successor. It 
could just as easily have been one 
of his favorites that followed him 
to power, in which case he would 
certainly not have wanted him to 
inherit any booby traps. No. As I 
saw it, either Eric was not really 
aware of this property of the 
stone, having acquired only par- 
tial instructions for its use, or 
someone had gotten to those pa- 
pers before I had and removed suf- 
ficient material to leave me with a 
mortal liability. It may well have 
been the hand of the real enemy, 
once again. 

“Safety factor?” I asked. 

GALAXY 




“No,” she said. “I can give you 
only two pointers, for whatever 
they may be worth. The first is 
that I do not recall Dad’s ever 
wearing it for long periods of 
time. The second, I pieced to- 
gether from a number of things 
that he said, beginning with a 
comment to the effect that ‘when 
people turn into statues you are 
either in the wrong place or in 
trouble’. I pressed him quite a bit 
on that, over a long period of 
time, and I eventually got the 
impression that the first sign of 
having worn it too long is some 
sort of distortion of your time 
sense. Apparently it begins 
speeding up the metabolism 
— everything — with a net effect 
that the world seems to be slow- 
ing down around you. This must 
take quite a toll on a person. That 
is everything that I know about it, 
and I admit that a large part of 
the last is guesswork. How long 
have you been wearing it?” 

“Awhile now,” I said, taking my 
mental pulse and glancing about 
to see whether things seemed to 
be slowing down any. 

I could not really tell, though of 
course I did not feel in the best of 
shape. I had assumed it was to- 
tally Gerard’s doing, though. I 
was not about to yank it off, how- 
ever, just because another family 
member had suggested it, even if 
it was clever Fiona in one of her 
friendlier moods. Perversity, 
cussedness. No, independence. 
That was it. That and purely for- 
mal distrust. I had only put it on 
for the evening a few hours be- 
fore, anyway. I’d wait. 

“Well, you have made your 



point in wearing it,” she was say- 
ing. “I simply wanted to advise 
you against prolonged exposure 
until you know more about it.” 
“Thanks, Fi. I’ll have it off 
soon, and I appreciate your telling 
me. By the way, whatever be- 
came of Dworkin?” 

She tapped her temple. 

"H is mind finally went, poor 
man. I like to think that Dad had 
him put away in some restful re- 
treat in Shadow.” 

“I see what you mean,” I said. 
“Yes, let us think that. Pour fel- 
low.” 

Julian rose to his feet, conclud- 
ing a conversation with Llewella. 
He stretched, nodded to her and 
strolled over. 

“Corwin, have you thought of 
any more questions for us?” he 
said. 

“None that I’d care to ask just 
now.” 

He smiled. 

“Anything more that you want 
to tell us?” 

“Not at the moment.” 

“Any more experiments, dem- 
onstrations, charades?” 

“No.” 

“Good. Then I’m going to bed. 
Good night.” 

“Night.” 

He bowed to Fiona, waved to 
Benedict and Bandom, nodded to 
Flora and Deirdre as he passed 
them on the way to the door. He 
aused on the threshold, turned 
ack and said, “Now you can all 
talk about me” and went on out. 

“All right,” Fiona said. “Let’s. I 
think he’s the one.” 

“Why?” 1 asked. 

“I’ll go down the list, subjec- 

127 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 




tive, intuitive and biased as it is. 
Benedict, in my opinion, is above 
suspicion. If he wanted the 
throne, he’d have it by now, by 
direct, military methods. With all 
the time he has had, he could 
have managed an attack that 
would have succeeded, even 
against Dad. He is that good, and 
we -all know it. You, on the other 
hand, have made a number of 
blunders which you would not 
have made had you been in full 
possession of your faculties. That 
is why I believe your story, am- 
nesia and all. No one gets himself 
blinded as a piece of strategy. 
Gerard is well on the way to es- 
tablishing his own innocence. I 
almost think he is up there with 
Brand now more for that reason 
than from any desire to protect 
Brand. At any rate, we will know 
for sure before long — or else have 
some new suspicions. Random has 
simply been watched too closely 
these past years to have had the 
opportunity to engineer every- 
thing that has been happening. So 
he is out. Of us more delicate 
sorts, Flora hasn’t the brains, 
Deirdre lacks the guts, Llewella 
hasn’t the motivations, as she is 
happy elsewhere but never here, 
and I, of course, am innocent of 
all but malice. That leaves Julian. 
Is he capable? Yes. Does he want 
the throne? Of course. Has he 
had time and opportunity? Again, 
yes. He is your man.” 

“Would he have killed Caine?” 
I asked. “They were buddies.” 

She curled her lip. 

“Julian has no friends,” she 
said. “That icy personality of his is 
thawed only by thoughts of him- 

128 



self. Oh, in recent years he 
seemed closer to Caine than to 
anyone else. But even that. 
Even that could have been a part 
of it. Shamming a friendship long 
enough to make it seem believ- 
able, so that he would not be sus- 
pect at this time. I can believe 
Julian capable of that because I 
cannot believe him capable of 
strong emotional attachments.” 

I snook my head. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “His 
friendship with Caine is some- 
thing that occurred during my ab- 
sence, so everyting I know con- 
cerning it is secondhand. Still, if 
Julian were looking for friendship 
in the form of another personality 
close to his own, I can see it. 
They were a lot alike. I tend to 
think it was real, because I don’t 
think anybody is capable of de- 
ceiving someone about his friend- 
ship for years. Unless the other 
party is awfully stupid, which is 
something Caine • was not. 
And — well, you say your reason- 
ing was subjective, intuitive and 
biased. So is mine, on something 
like this. I just don’t like to think 
anybody is such a miserable 
wretch that he would use his only 
friend that way. That’s why I 
think there is something wrong 
with your list.” 

She sighed. 

“For someone who has been 
around for as long as you have, 
Corwin, you say some silly things. 
Were you changed by your long 
stay in that funny little place? 
Years ago you would have seen 
the obvious, as I do.” 

“Perhaps I have changed, for 
such things no longer seem obvi- 

GALAXY 




ous. Or could it be that you have 
changed, Fiona? A trifle more 
cynical that the little girl I once 
knew. It might not have been all 
that obvious to you, years ago.” 

She smiled softly. 

“Never tell a woman she has 
changed, Corwin. Except for the 
better. You used to know that, 
too. Could it be that you are re- 
ally only one of Corwin’s shadows, 
sent back to suffer and intimidate 
here on his behalf? Is the real 
Corwin somewhere else, laughing 
at us all?” 

“I am here, and I am not laugh- 
ing,” I said. 

She laughed. 

“Yes, that is it!” she said. “I 
have just decided that you are not 
yourself! 

“Announcement, everybody!” 
she cried, springing to her feet. “I 
have just noticed that this is not 
really Corwin! It has to be one of 
his shadows! It has just an- 
nounced a belief in friendship, 
dignity, nobility of spirit and 
those other things which figure 
preminently in popular romances! 
I am obviously onto something!” 

The others stared at her. She 
laughed again, then sat down 
abruptly. 

I heard Flora mutter “drunk” 
and return to her conversation 
with Deirdre. Random said, 
“Let’s hear it for shadows” and 
turned back to a discussion with 
Benedict and Llewella. 

“See?” she said. 

“What?” 

“You’re insubstantial,” she said, 
patting my knee. “And so am I, 
now that I think about it. It has 
been a bad day, Corwin.” 



“I know. I feel like hell, too. I 
thought I had such a fine idea, for 
getting Brand back. Not only that, 
it worked. A lot of good it did 
him.” 

“Don’t overlook those bits of 
virtue you’ve acquired,” she said. 
“You’re not to blame for the way 
it turned out.” 

“Thanks.” 

“I believe that Julian might 
have had the right idea,” she said. 
“I don’t feel like staying awake 
any longer.” 

I rose with her, walked her to 
the door. 

“I’m all right,” she said. “Re- 
ally.” 

“Sure?” 

She nodded sharply. 

“See you in the morning then.” 

“I hope so,” she said. “Now 
you can talk about me.” 

She winked and went out. 

I turned back, saw that Ben- 
edict and Llewella were ap- 
proaching. 

“Turning in?” I asked. 

Benedict nodded. 

“Might as well,” Llewella said, 
and she kissed me lightly on the 
cheek. 

“What was that for?” 

“A number of things,” she said. 
“Good night.” 

“Good night.” 

Random was crouched on the 
hearth, poking at the fire. 
Deirdre turned to him and said, 
“Don’t throw on more wood just 
for us. Flora and I are going, 
too.” 

“Okay.” He set the poker aside 
and rose. “Sleep well, ’ he called 
after them. 

Deirdre gave me a sleepy smile 

129 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 




and Flora a nervous one. I added 
my good nights and watched them 
leave. 

“Learn anything new and use- 
ful?” Random asked. 

I shrugged. 

“Did you?” 

“Opinions, conjectures. No new 
facts, ’ he said. “We were trying 
to decide who might be next on 
the list.” 

“And. .?” 

“Benedict thinks it’s a tossup. 
You or him. Providing you are not 
behind it all, of course. He also 
thinks your buddy Ganelon ought 
to watch his step.” 

“Ganelon. Yes, that’s a 
thought — and it should have 
been mine. I think he is right 
about the tossup, too. It may 
even be slightly weighted against 
him, since they know I’m alert 
because of the attempted 
frameup.” 

“I would say that all of us are 
now aware that Benedict is alert 
himself. He managed to mention 
his opinion to everyone. I believe 
that he would welcome an at- 
tempt.” 

I chuckled. 

“That balances the coin again. I 
guess it is a tossup.” 

“He said that, too. Naturally, 
he knew I would tell you.” 

“Naturally. I wish he would 
start talking to me again. Well. 
Not much I can do about it now,” 
I said. “The hell with everything. 
I’m going to bed.” 

He nodded. 

“Look under it first.” 

We left the room, headed up 
the hall. 

“Corwin, I wish you’d had the 

130 



foresight to bring some coffee 
back with you, along with the 
guns,” he said. “I could use a 
cup.” 

“Doesn’t it keep you awake?” 
“No. I like a couple cups in the 
evening.” 

“I miss it mornings. We’ll have 
to import some when this mess is 
all settled.” 

“Small comfort, but a good 
idea. — What got into Fi, any- 
how?” 

“She thinks Julian is our man.” 
"She may be right.” 

“What about Caine?” 
“Supposing it was not a single 
individual,’ he said, as we 
mounted the stair. “Say it was 
two, like Julian and Caine. They 
finally had a falling out, Caine 
lost, Julian disposed of him and 
used the death to weaken your 
position as well. Former friends 
make the worst enemies.” 

“It’s no use,” I said. “I get 
dizzy when I start sorting the pos- 
sibilities. We are either going to 
have to wait for something more 
to happen, or make something 
happen. Probably the latter. But 
not tonight — ” 

“Hey! Wait up!” 

“Sorry.” I paused at the land- 
ing. “Don’t know what got into 
me. Finishing spurt, I guess.” 
“Nervous energy,’ he said, 
coming abreast of me once more. 
We continued on up, and I made 
an effort to match his pace, fight- 
ing down a desire to hurry. 

“Well, sleep well,” he said, fi- 
nally. 

“Good night, Random.” 

He continued on up the stair 
and I headed off along the cor- 

GALAXY 




ridor toward my quarters. I was 
feeling jittery by then, which 
must be why I dropped my key. 

I reached and plucked it out of 
the air before it had fallen very 
far. Simultaneously, I was struck 
by the impression that its motion 
was somewhat slower than it 
should have been. I inserted it in 
the lock and turned it. 

The room was dark, but I de- 
cided against getting a candle or 
an oil lamp going. I had gotten 
used to the dark a long time ago. 
I locked and bolted the door. My 
eyes were already half-adj listed to 
the gloom, from the dim hallway. 
I turned. There was some star- 
light leaking in about the drapes, 
too. I crossed the room, unfasten- 
ing my collar. 

He was waiting in my bed 
chamber, to the left of the en- 
trance. He was perfectly positioned 
and he did nothing to give himself 
away. I walked right into it. He 
had the ideal station, he held the 
dagger ready, he had the element 
of total surprise going for him. By 
rights I should have died — not in 
my bed, but just there at its foot. 

I caught a glimpse of the 
movement, realized the presence 
and its significance as I stepped 
over the threshold. 

I knew that it was too late to 
avoid the thrust even as I raised 
my arm to try to block it. But one 
peculiarity struck me before the 
blade itself did: my assailant 
seemed to be moving too slowly. 
Quick, with all the tension of his 
wait behind it, that is how it 
should have been. I should never 
have known it was occurring until 
after the act, if then. I should not 



have had time to turn partway 
and swing my arm as far as I did. 
A ruddy haze filled my vision and 
I felt my forearm strike the side 
of the outflung arm at about the 
same moment as the steel 
touched my belly and bit. Within 
the redness there seemed a faint 
tracing of that cosmic version of 
the Pattern I had followed earlier 
in the day. As I doubled and fell, 
unable to think but still for a 
moment conscious, it came 
clearer, came nearer, the design. 
I wanted to flee, but horse my 
body stumbled. 1 was thrown. 

VIII. 

Out of every life a little blood 
must spill. Unfortunately, it was 
my turn again, and it felt like 
more than a little. I was lying, 
doubled up, on my right side, 
both arms clutching at my mid- 
dle. I was wet, and every now 
and then something trickled along 
the creases of my belly. Front, 
lower left, just above the beltline, 
I felt like a casually opened en- 
velope. These were my first sen- 
sations as consciousness came 
round again. And my first thought 
was, “What is he waiting for?” 
Obviously, the coup de grace had 
been withheld. Why? 

I opened my eyes. They had 
taken advantage of whatever time 
had elapsed to adjust themselves 
to the darkness. I turned my 
head. I did not see anyone else in 
the room with me. But something 
peculiar had occurred and I could 
not quite place it. I closed my 
eyes and let my head fall back to 
the mattress once more. 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



131 




Something was wrong, yet at 
the same time right. 

The mattress. Yes, I, was 
lying on my bed. I doubted my 
ability to have gotten there unas- 
sisted. But it would be absurd to 
knife me and then help me to 
bed — 

My bed. It was my bed, yet 
it was not. 

I squeezed my eyes tight. I 
gritted my teeth. 1 did not under- 
stand. I knew that my thinking 
could not be normal there on the 
fringes of shock, my blood pooling 
in my guts and then leaking out. I 
tried to force myself to think 
clearly. It was not easy. 

My bed. Before you are fully 
aware of anything else, you are 
aware whether or not you are 
awakening on your own bed. And 
I was, but — 

I fought down an enormous im- 
pulse to sneeze, because I felt it 
would tear me apart. I compressed 
my nostrils and breathed in 
short gasps through my mouth. 
The taste, smell and feel of dust 
was all about me. 

The nasal assault subsided and I 
opened my eyes. I knew then 
where I was. I did not understand 
the why and how of it, but I had 
come once more to a place I had 
never expected to see again. 

I lowered my right hand, used 
it to raise myself. 

It was my bedroom in my 
house. The old one. The place 
which had been mine back when 
I was Carl Corey. I had been re- 
turned to Shadow, to that world 
where I had spent the years of my 
exile. The room was heavy witn 
dust. The bed had not been made 



up since the last time I had slept 
in it, over half a decade before. I 
knew the state of the house fully, 
having looked in on it only a few 
weeks earlier. 

I pushed myself further, man- 
aged to slide my feet out over the 
edge of the bed and down. Then 1 
doubled up again and sat there. It 
was bad. 

While I felt temporarily safe 
from further assault, I knew that I 
required more than safety just 
then. I had to have help, and I 
was in no position to help myself. 
I was not even certain how much 
longer 1 might remain conscious. 
So I had to get down and get out. 
The phone would be dead, the 
nearest house was not too close 
by. I would have to get down to 
the road, at least. I reflected 

S 'rimly that one of my reasons for 
ocating where I had was that it 
was not a well-traveled road. I 
enjoy my solitude, at least some 
of the time. 

With my right hand, I drew up 
the nearest pillow and slipped off 
its case. I turned it inside out, 
tried to fold it, gave up, wadded 
it, slipped it beneath my shirt and 
pressed it against my wound. 
Then I sat there, just holding it in 
place. It had been a major exer- 
tion and I found it painful to take 
too deep a breath. 

After a time, though, I drew 
the second pillow to me, held it 
across my knees and let it slip out 
of its case. I wanted the pillowslip 
to wave at a passing motorist, for 
my garments, as usual, were dark. 
Before I could draw it through my 
belt though, I was confounded by 
the behavior of the pillow itself. It 



132 



GALAXY 




had not yet reached the floor. 1 
had released it, nothing was sup- 
porting it and it was moving. But 
it was moving quite slowly, de- 
scending with a dream-like delib- 
eration. 

I thought of the fall of the key, 
as I had dropped it outside my 
room. I thought of my unintended 
quickness on mounting the stair 
with Random. I thought of Fiona s 
words, and of the Jewel of Judg- 
ment which still hung about my 
neck, now pulsating in time with 
the throbbing of my side. It might 
have saved my life, at least for the 
moment; yes, it probably had, if 
Fiona’s notions were correct. It 
had probably given me a moment 
or so more than would otherwise 
have been my due when the as- 
sailant struck, letting me turn, 
letting me swing my arm. It 
might, somehow, even have been 
responsible for my sudden trans- 
portation. But I would have to 
think about such things at another 
time, should I succeed in main- 
taining a meaningful relationship 
with the future. For now, the 
jewel had to go — in case Fiona’s 
fears concerning it were also 
correct — and I had to get moving. 

I turked away the second pillow 
cover, then tried to stand, holding 
onto the footboard. No good! Diz- 
ziness and too much pain. I low- 
ered myself to the floor, afraid of 
passing out on the way down. I 
made it. I rested. Then I began to 
move, a slow crawl. 

The front door, as I recalled, 
was now nailed shut. All right. 
Out the back, then. 

I made it to the bedroom door 
and halted, leaning against its 



frame. As I rested there, I re- 
moved the Jewel of Judgment 
from my neck and wrapped its 
chain about my wrist. I had to 
cache it someplace, and the safe 
in my study was too far out of the 
way. Besides, I believed that I 
was leaving a trail of blood. Any- 
one finding and following it might 
well be curious enough to investi- 
gate and spring the small thing. 
And I lacked the time and the 
energy. 

I made my way out, around and 
through. I had to rise up and 
exert myself to get the back door 
open. I made the mistake of not 
resting first. 

When I regained consciousness, 
I was lying across the threshold. 
The night was raw and clouds fill- 
ed much of the, sky. A mean 
wind rattled branches above the 
patio. I felt several drops of mois- 
ture on the back of my outflung 
hand. 

I pushed up and crawled out. 
The snow was about two inches 
deep. The icy air helped to revive 
me. With something near panic, I 
realized just how foggy my mind 
had been during much of my 
course from the bedroom. It was 
possible that I might go under at 
any time. 

I started immediately for the far 
corner of the house, deviating 
only to reach the compost heap, 
tear my way into it, drop the 
jewel and reposition the clump of 
dead grasses I had broken loose. I 
brushed snow over it and. con- 
tinued on. 

Once I made it around the 
corner, I was shielded from the 
wind and headed down a slight 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



133 




incline. I reached the front of the 
house and rested once more. A 
car had just passed and I watched 
its tail lights dwindle. It was the 
only vehicle in sight. 

Icy crystals stung my face as I 
moved again. My knees were wet 
and burning cold. The front yard 
sloped, gently at first, then drop- 
ped sharply toward the road. 
There was a dip about a hundred 
yards to the right, where 
motorists generally hit their 
brakes. It seemed this might give 
me a few moments more in the 
headlights of anyone coming from 
that direction — one of those small 
assurances the mind always seeks 
when things get serious, an aspi- 
rin for the emotions. With three 
rest stops, I made it down to the 
roadside, then over to the big 
rock that bore my house number. 
I sat on it and leaned back against 
the icy embankment. I hauled out 
the second pillow case and draped 
it across my knees. 

I waited. I knew that my mind 
was fuzzy. I believe that I drifted 
into and out of consciousness a 
number of times. Whenever I 
caught myself at it, I attempted to 
impose some version of order on 
my thoughts, to assess what had 
happened in the light of every- 
thing else that had just happened, 
to seek other safety measures. 
The former effort proved too 
much, however. It was simply too 
difficult to think beyond the level 
of responding to circumstance. 
With a sort of numb enlighten- 
ment, though, it occurred to me 
that I still had my Trumps. I could 
contact someone in Amber, have 
him transport me back. 

134 



But who? I was not so far gone 
that I failed to realize I might be 
contacting the one responsible for 
my condition. Would it be better 
to gamble that way, or to take my 
chances here? Still, Random or 
Gerard — 

I thought that I heard a car. 
Faint, distant. The wind and 
my pulsebeat were competing 
with perception, though. I turned 
my head. I concentrated. 

There. Again. Yes. It was an 
engine. I got ready to wave the 
cloth. 

Even then, my mind kept stray- 
ing. And one thought that flitted 
through was that I might already 
be unable to muster sufficient 
concentration to manipulate the 
Trumps. 

The sound grew louder. I 
raised the cloth. Moments later, 
the farthest visible point along the 
road to my right was touched with 
light. Shortly after, I saw the car 
at the top of the rise, I lost sight 
of it once more as it descended 
the hill. Then it climbed again 
and came on, snowflakes flashing 
through its headbeams. 

I began waving as it approached 
the dip. The lignts caught me as 
it came up out of it, and the 
driver could not have missed see- 
ing me. He went by though, a 
man in a late model sedan, a 
woman in the passenger seat. The 
woman turned and looked at me, 
but the driver did not even slow 
down. 

... .A couple minutes later 
another car came by, a bit older, 
a woman driving, no visible pas- 
sengers. It did slow down, but 
only for a moment. She must not 

GALAXY 




have liked my looks. She stepped 
on the gas and was gone. 

I sagged back and rested. A 
prince of Amber can hardly invoke 
the brotherhood of man for pur- 
poses of moral condemnation. At 
least not with a straight face, and 
it hurt too much to laugh just 
then. 

Without strength, concentration 
and some ability to move, my 
power over Shadow was useless. I 
would use it first, I decided, to 
get to some warm place. I 
wondered whether I could make 
it back up the hill, to the compost 
heap. I had not thought of trying 
to use the jewel to alter the 
weather. Probably, I was too 
weak for that too, though. Proba- 
bly, the effort would kill me. 
Still. 

I shook my head. I was drifting 
off, more than half a-dream. I had 
to stay awake. Was that another 
car? Maybe. I tried to raise the 
cloth and dropped it. When I 
leaned forward to retrieve it, I 
just had to rest my head on my 
knees for a moment. Deirdre. 
I would call my dear sister. If 
anyone would help me, Deirdre 
would. I would get out her 
Trump and call her. In a minute. 
If only she weren’t my sister. I 
had to rest. I am a knave, not a 
fool. Perhaps, sometimes, when I 
rest, I am even sorry for things. 
Some things. If only it were 
warmer. But it wasn’t too bad, 
bent over this way. Was that a 
car? I wanted to raise my head, 
but found that I could not. It 
would not make that much differ- 
ence in being seen though, I de- 
cided. 



I felt light on my eyelids and I 
heard the engine. Now it was 
neither advancing nor retreating. 
Just a steady cycling of growls. 
Then I heard a shout. Then the 
click-pause-chunk of a car door, 
opening and closing. I felt that I 
could open my eyes, but I did not 
want to. I was afraid that I would 
look only on the dark and empty 
road, that the sounds would re- 
solve into pulsebeats and wind 
once more. It was better to keep 
what I had than to gamble — 

“Hey! What’s the matter? You 
hurt?” 

Footsteps. This was real. 

I opened my eyes. I forced 
msyelf up once again. 

“Corey! My God! It’s you!” 

I forced a grin, cut my nod 
short of a topple. 

“It’s me. Bill. How’ve you 
been?” 

“What happened?” 

“I’m hurt,’ I said. “Maybe bad. 
Need a doctor.” 

“Can you walk if I help? Or 
should I carry you?” 

“Let’s try walking,” I said. 

He got me to my feet and I 
leaned on him. We started for his 
car. I only remember the first few 
steps. 

When that low-swinging sweet 
chariot turned sour and swung 
high once more, I tried to raise 
my arm, realized that it was re- 
strained, settled for a considera- 
tion of the tube affixed thereto 
and decided that I was going to 
live. I had sniffed hospital smells 
and consulted my internal clock. 
Having made it this far, I felt that 
I owed it to myself to continue. 
And I was warm, and as comfort- 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



135 




able as recent history allowed. 
That settled, I closed my eyes, 
lowered my head and went hack 
to sleep. 

Later, when I came around 
again, felt more fit and was spot- 
ted by a nurse, she told me that it 
was seven hours since I had been 
brought in and that a doctor 
would be by to talk with me 
shortly. She also got me a glass of 
water and told me that it had 
stopped snowing. She was curious 
as to what had happened to me. 

I decided that it was time to 
start plotting my story. The sim- 
pler the better. All right. I was 
coming home after an extended 
stay abroad. I had hitchhiked out, 
gone on in and been attacked by 
some vandal or drifter I had sur- 
prised inside. I crawled back out 
and sought help. Finis. 

When I tola it to the doctor I 
could not tell at first whether he 
believed me. He was a heavy man 
whose face had sagged and set 
long ago. His name was Bailey, 
Morris Bailey, and he nodded as I 
spoke and then asked me, “Did 
you get a look at the fellow?” 

I snook my head. 

“It was dark,” I said: 

“Did he rob you, too?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Were you carrying a wallet?” 

I decided I had better say yes 
to that one. 

“Well, you don’t have one now, 
so he must have taken it.” 

“Must have,” I agreed. 

“Do you remember me at all?” 
“Can t say that I do. Should I?” 
“You seemed vaguely familiar 
to me when they brought you in. 
That was all, at first. ’ 



“And. .?” I asked. 

“What sort of garments were 
you wearing? They seemed some- 
thing like a uniform.” 

“Latest thing. Over There, 
these days. You were saying that I 
looked familiar?” 

“Yes,” he agreed. “Where is 
Over There, anyway? Where did 
ou come from? Where have you 
een?” 

“I travel a lot,” I said. “You 
were going to tell me something a 
moment ago.” 

“Yes,” he said. “We are a small 
clinic, and some time ago a fast- 
talking salesman persuaded the 
directors to invest in a com- 
puterized medical records system. 
If the area had developed more 
and we had expanded a lot, it 
might have been worthwhile. 
Neither of these things happened, 
though, and it is an expensive 
item. It even encouraged a cer- 
tain laziness among the clerical 
help. Old files just don’t get 
purged the way they used to, 
even for the emergency room. 
Space there for a lot of useless 
backlog. So, when Mister Roth 
gave me your name and I ran a 
routine check on you, I found 
something and I realized why you 
looked familiar. I had been work- 
ing the emergency room that 
night too, around seven years ago, 
when you had your auto accident. 
I remembered working on you 
then— and how I thought you 
weren’t going to make it. You 
surprised me though, and you still 
do. I can’t even find the scars that 
should be there. You did a nice 
job of healing up.” 

“Thanks. A tribute to the 



136 GALAXY 




physician. I’d say.” 

“May I have your age, for the 
record?” 

“Thirty-six,” I said. That’s al- 
ways safe. 

He jotted it somewhere in the 
folder he held across his knees. 

“You know, I would have 
sowrn — once I got to checking 
you over and remepibering — that 
that’s about the age you looked 
the last time I saw you.” 

“Clean living.” 

“Do you know about your blood 
type?” 

“It’s an exotic. But you can 
treat it as an AB Positive for all 
practical purposes. I can take any- 
thing, but don’t give mine to any- 
body else.” 

He nodded. 

“The nature of your mishap is 
going to require a police report, 
you know.” 

“I had guessed that.” 

“Just thought you might want 
to be thinking about it.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “So you were 
on duty that night, and you 
patched me up. ? Interesting. 
What else do you recall about it? ’ 
“What do you mean?” 

“The circumstances under 
which I was brought in that time. 
My own memory is a blank from 
right before the accident until 
some time after I had been trans 
ferred up to the other place- 
— Greenwood. Do you recall how 
I arrived?” 

He frowned, just when I had 
decided he had one face for all 
occasions. 

“We sent an ambulance,’’ he 
said. 

“In response to what? Who re- 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



ported the accident? How?” 

“I see what you mean,” he said. 
“It was the State Patrol that called 
for the ambulance. As I recollect, 
someone had seen the accident 
and phoned their headquarters. 
They then radioed a car in the vi- 
cinity. It went to the lake, ver- 
ified the report, gave you first aid 
and called for the ambulance. And 
that was it.” 

“Any record of who called in 
the report in the first place?” 

He shrugged. 

“That’s not the sort of thing we 
keep track of,” he said. “Didn’t 
your insurance company investi- 
gate? Wasn’t there a claim? They 
could probably — ” 

“I had to leave the country 
right after I recovered,” I said. ' I 
never pursued the matter. I sup- 
pose tnere would have been a 
police report, though. .” 

“Surely. But I have no idea 
how long they keep them 
around — ” He chuckled. “Unless, 
of course, that same salesman got 
to them, too. — It is rather late to 
be talking about that though, isn’t 
it? It seems to me there is a sta- 
tute of limitations on things of 
that sort. Your friend Roth will 
tell you for sure — ” 

“It isn’t a claim that I have in 
mind,” I said. “Just a desire to 
know what really happened. I 
have wondered about it on and off 
for a number of years now. You 
see, I have this touch of retrograde 
amnesia going — ” 

“Have you ever talked it over 
with a psychiatrist?” he said, and 
there was something about the 
way he said it that I did not like. 
Came one of those little flashes of 



137 




insight then: Could Flora have 
managed to get me certified in- 
sane before my transfer ' to 
Greenwood? Was that on my re- 
cord here? And was I still on ex- 
cape status from that place? A lot 
of time had passed and I knew 
nothing of the legalities involved. 
If this was indeed the case, how- 
ever, I imagined they would have 
no way of knowing whether I had 
been certified sane again in some 
other jurisdiction. Prudence, I 
guess it was, cautioned me to lean 
forward and glance at the doctor’s 
wrist. I seemed possessed of a 
subliminal memory that he had 
consulted a calendar watch when 
taking my pulse. Yes, he had. I 
squinted. All right. Day & month: 
November 28. I did a quick calcu- 
lation with my two-and-a-half to 
one conversion and had the year. 
It was seven, as he had indicated. 

“No, I haven’t,” I said. “I just 
assumed it was organic rather 
than functional and wrote the 
time off as a loss.” 

“I see,” he said. “You use such 
ph rases rather glibly. People 
who’ve been in therapy some- 
times do that.” 

“I know,” I said, “I’ve read a 
lot about it.” 

He sighed. He stood. 

“Look,” he said. “I am going to 
call Mister Roth and let him know 
ou are awake. It is probably 
est.” 

“What do you mean by that?” 

“I mean that with your friend 
being an attorney, there might be 
things you want to discuss with 
him before you talk to the 
police.” 

He opened the folder wherein 

138 



he had somewhere jotted my age, 
raised his pen, furrowed his brow 
and said, “What’s the date, any- 
way?” 

I wanted my Trumps. I im- 
agined my belongings would be in 
the drawer of the bedside table, 
but getting at it involved too 
much twisting and I did not want 
to put the strain on my sutures. It 
was not all that urgent, though. 
Eight hours’ sleep in Amber 
would come to around twenty 
hours here, so everyone should 
still have been respectably retired 
back home. I wanted to get hold 
of Random though, to come up 
with some sort of cover story for 
my not being there in the morn- 
ing. Later. 

I did not want to look suspi- 
cious at a time like this. Also, I 
wanted to know immediately 
whatever Brand had to say. I 
wanted to be in a position to act 
on it. I did a quick bit of mental 
juggling. If I could do the worst 
of my recovering here in Shadow 
it would mean less wasted time 
for me back in Amber. I would 
have to budget my time carefully 
and avoid complications on this 
end. I hoped that Bill would ar- 
rive soon. I was anxious to know 
what the picture was in this place. 

Bill was a native of the area, 
had gone to school in Buffalo, 
come back, married, joined the 
family firm and that was that. He 
had known me as a retired Army 
officer who sometimes traveled on 
vague business. We both be- 
longed to the country club, which 
was where I had met him. I had 
known him for over a year with- 
out our exchanging more than a 

GALAXY 




few words. Then one evening I 
happened to be next to him in the 
bar and it had somehow come out 
that he was hot on military his- 
tory, particularly the Napoleonic 
Wars. The next thing we knew, 
they were closing the place up 
around us. We were close friends 
from then on, right up until the 
time of my difficulties. I had occa- 
sionally wondered about him 
since. In fact, the only thing that 
had prevented me from seeing 
him the last time I had passed 
through was that he would doubt- 
less have had all sorts of questions 
as to what had become of me, and 
I had had too many things on my 
mind to deal with them all that 
racefully and still enjoy myself. I 
ad even thought once or twice of 
coming back and seeing him if I 
could, when everything was fi- 
nally settled in Amber. Next to 
the fact that this was not the case, 
I regretted not being able to meet 
him in the club lounge. 

H e arrived within the hour, 
short, heavy, ruddy, a bit grayer 
on the sides, grinning, nodding. I 
had propped myself up by then, 
already tried a few deep breaths 
and decided they were prema- 
ture. He clasped my hand and 
took the bedside chair. He had 
his briefcase with him. 

“You scared the hell out of me 
last night, Carl. Thought I was 
seeing a ghost,” he said. 

I nodded. 

“A bit later, and I might have 
been one,” I said. “Thanks. How 
have you been?” 

Bill sighed. 

“Busy. You know. The same old 
stuff, only more of it.” 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



“And Alice?” 

“She’s fine. And we’ve got two 
new grandsons — Bill Jr.’s — twins. 
Wait a minute.” 

He fished out his wallet and lo- 
cated a photo. 

“Here.” 

I studied it, noted the family 
resemblances. 

“Hard to believe,” I said. 

“You don’t look much worse for 
the years.” 

I chuckled and patted my ab- 
domen. 

“Subtracting that, I mean,” he 
said. “Where nave you been?” 

“God! Where haven’t I been!” I 
said. “So many places I’ve lost 
count.” 

He remained expressionless, 
caught my eyes and stared. 

“Carl, what kind of trouble are 
you in?” he asked. 

I smiled. 

“If you mean am I in trouble 
with the law, the answer is no. 
My troubles actually involve 
another country, and I am going 
to have to go back there shortly.” 

H is face relaxed again, and 
there was a small glint behind his 
bifocals. 

“Are you some sort of military 
adviser in that place?” 

I nodded. 

“Can you tell me where?” 

I shook my head. 

“Sorry.” 

“That I can sort of understand,” 
he said. “Doctor Roth told me 
what you said had happened last 
night. Off the record now, was it 
connected with whatever you 
have been doing?” 

I nodded again. 

“That makes things a little 

139 




clearer,” he said. “Not much, but 
enough. I won’t even ask you 
which agency, or even if there is 
one. I have always known you to 
be a gentleman, and a rational 
one at that. That was why I grew 
curious at the time of your disap- 
pearance and did some investigat- 
ing. I felt a bit officious and self- 
conscious about it. But your civil 
status was quite puzzling, and I 
wanted to know what had hap- 
pened. Mainly, because I was 
concerned about you. I hope that 
doesn’t disturb you?” 

“Disturb me?” I said. “There 
aren’t that many people who care 
what happens to me. I’m grateful. 
Also, curious what you disco- 
vered. I never had the time to 
look into it, you know, to straigh- 
ten things out. How about telling 
me what you learned?” 

He opened the briefcase and 
withdrew a manila folder. Spread- 
ing it across his knees, he shuffled 
out several sheets of yellow paper 
covered with neat handwriting. 
Raising the first of these, he re- 
garded it a moment, then said, 

‘ After you escaped from the hos- 
pital in Albany and had your acci- 
dent, Brandon apparently drop- 
ped out of the picture and — ” 
“Stop!” I said, raising my hand, 
trying to sit up. 

“What?” he asked. 

“You have the order wrong, 
also the place,” I said. “First 
came the accident, and Green- 
wood is not in Albany.” 

“I know,” he said. “I was refer- 
ring to the Porter Sanitarium, 
where you spent two days and 
then escaped. You had had your 
accident that same day, and you 



were brought here as a result of 
it. Then your sister Evelyn en- 
tered the picture. She had you 
transferred to Greenwood, where 
you spent a couple weeks before 
departing on your own motion 
once again. Right?” 

“Partly,” I said. “Namely, the 
last part. As I was telling the doc- 
tor earlier, my memory is shot for 
a couple days prior to the acci- 
dent. This business about a place 
in Albany does sort of seem to 
ring a bell, but only very faintly. 
Do you have more on it?’ 

“Oh yes,” he said. “It may even 
have something to do with the 
state of your memory. You were 
committed on a bum order — ” 

“By whom?” 

He shook the paper and 
peered. 

“ ‘Brother, Brandon Corey; at- 
tendant physician, Hillary B. 
Rand, psychiatrist’, ” he read. 
“Hear any more bells?” 

“Quite possibly,” I 'said. “Go 
ahead.” 

“Well, an order got signed on 
that basis,” he said. “You were 
duly certified, taken into custody 
and transported. Then, concern- 
ing your memory. .” 

“Yes?” 

“I don’t know that much about 
the practice and its effects on the 
memory, but you were subjected 
to electroshock therapy while you 
were at Porter. Then, as I said, 
the record indicates that you es- 
caped after the second day. You 
apparently recovered your car 
from some unspecified locale and 
were heading back this way when 
you had the accident.” 

“That seems right,” I said. “It 



140 GALAXY 




does.” For a moment, when he 
had begun talking, 1 had had a 
wild vision of having been re- 
turned to the wrong shadow — one 
where everything was similar, but 
not congruent. Now, though, I did 
not believe this to be the case. I 
was responding to this story on 
some level. 

“Now, about that order,” he 
said. “It was based on false evi- 
dence, but there was no way of 
the court’s knowing it at the time. 
The real Doctor Rand W'as in Eng- 
land when everything happened, 
and when I contacted him later 
he had never heard of you. His 
office had been broken into while 
he was away, though. Also, pecu- 
liarly, his middle initial is not B. 
He had never heard of Brandon 
Corey either.” 

“What did become of Bran- 
don?” 

“He simply vanished. Several 
attempts were made to contact 
him at the time of your escape 
from Porter, but he could not be 
found. Then you had the acci- 
dent, were brought here and 
treated. At that time, a woman 
named Evelyn Flaumel, who rep- 
resented herself as your sister, 
contacted this place, told them 
you had been probated and that 
the family wanted you transferred 
to Greenwood. In the absence of 
Brandon, who had been ap- 
pointed your guardian, her in- 
structions were followed, as the 
only available next of kin. That 
was how it came about that you 
were sent to the other place. You 
escaped again, a couple weeks 
later, ana that is where my 
chronology ends.” 



’’then what is my legal status 
right now?” I asked. 

“Oh, you’ve been made whole,” 
he said. “Doctor Rand went down 
after I talked with him and gave 
the court an affidavit reciting 
these facts. The order was va- 
cated.” 

“Then why is the doctor here 
acting as if I might be a psycho 
case?” 

“Oh my! That is a thought. It 
hadn’t occurred to me. All their 
records would show here is that at 
one time you apparently were. I 
had better see him on the way 
out. I have a copy of the journal 
entry in here, too. I can show it 
to him.” 

“How long was it after I left 
Greenwood that things were set 
right with the court?” 

“The following month,” he said. 
“It was several weeks before I 
could bring myself to get nosy.” 

“You couldn’t know how happy 
I am that you did,” I said. “And 
you have given me several pieces 
of information I think are going to 
prove extremely important.” 

“It is nice to be able to help a 
friend sometime,” he said, closing 
the folder and replacing it in his 
briefcase. “One thing. When 
this is all over — whatever you are 
doing — if you are permitted to 
talk about it, I would like to hear 
the story.” 

“I can’t promise. .” I said. 

“I know. Just thought I’d men- 
tion it. — By the way, what do 
you want to do about the house?” 

“Mine? Do I still hold title to 
it?” 

“Yes, but it will probably be 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



141 




sold this year for back taxes if you 
don’t do anything about it.” 

“I’m surprised that hasn’t al- 
ready happened.” 

“You gave the bank power of 
attorney for paying your bills.” 

“I never thought of that. I’d 
just set it up for utilities and my 
charge accounts. Stuff like that.” 
“Well, the account is nearly 
empty now,” he said. “I was talk- 
ing to McNally over there the 
other day. That means the house 
will go next year if you don’t do 
anything.” 

“I’ve got no use for it now,” I 
said. “They can do whatever they 
want with it.” 

“Then you might as well sell it 
and realize what you can.” 

“I won’t be around that long.” 

“I could handle it for you. Send 
the money wherever you want.” 
“All right,” I said. “I’ll sign 
anything necessary. Pay my hospi- 
tal bill out of it and keep the 
rest.” 

“I couldn’t do that.” 

I shrugged. 

“Do whatever you think best, 
but be sure and take a good fee.” 
“I’ll put the balance in your ac- 
count.” 

“All right. Thanks. — By the 
way, before I forget, would you 
look in the drawer of that table 
and see if there is a deck of cards 
there? I can’t reach it yet, and I’ll 
be wanting them later.” 

“Surely. ’ 

He reached over, opened it. 

“A big brown envelope,” he 
said. “Kind of bulgy. They proba- 
bly put whatever was in your 
pockets in it.” 

"Open it.” 

142 



“Yes, here’s a pack of cards,” 
he said, reaching inside. “Say! 
That’s a beautiful case! May I?” 

“I — ” What could I say? 

He slipped the case. 

“Lovely. .” he murmurred. 
“Some kind of Tarots. Are they 
antique?” 

“Yes.” 

“Cold as ice. I never saw 
anything like these. Say, that’s 
ou! Dressed up like some kind of 
night! — What s their purpose?” 
“A very complicated game,” I 
said. 

“How could that be you if they 
are antique?” 

“I didn’t say it was me. You 
did.” 

“Yes, so I did. Ancestor?” 

“Sort of.” 

“Now that’s a good looking gal! 
— But so is the redhead. .” 

“I think. .” 

He squared the deck and re- 
placed it in the case. He passed it 
to me. 

“Nice unicorn, too,” he added. 
“I shouldn’t have looked at them, 
should I?” 

“That’s all right.” 

He sighed and leaned back in 
the chair, clasping his hands be- 
hind his head. 

“I couldn’t help it,” he said. “It 
is just that there is something 
very strange about you, Carl, 
beyond any hush-hush work you 
may be doin;* — and mysteries in- 
trigue me. I ve never been this 
close to a real puzzler before.” 
“Because you just slipped your- 
self a cold deck of Tarots?” I 
asked. 

“No, that just adds atmos- 
phere,” he said. “While what you 

GALAXY 




have been doing all these years is 
admittedly none of my business, 
there is one recent incident I am 
unable to comprehend.” 

“What is that?” 

“After I brought you here and 
took Alice home last night, I went 
back to your place, hoping to get 
some sort of idea as to wnat had 
happened. The snow had let up 
by then, though it started in again 
later, and your track was still 
clearly visible, going around the 
house and down the front 
yard. .” 

I nodded. 

“But there were no tracks going 
in — nothing to indicate your arri- 
val. And for that matter, there 
were no other tracks departing 
— nothing to show the flight of 
your assailant.” 

I chuckled. 

“You think the wound was self- 
inflicted?” 

“No, of course not. There 
wasn’t even a weapon in sight. I 
followed the bloodstains back to 
the bedroom, to your bed. I had 
only my flashlight to see by, of 
course, but what I saw gave me 
an eerie feeling. It seemed as if 
you had just suddenly appeared 
there on the bed, bleeding, and 
then gotten up and made your 
way'out. ” 

“Impossible, of course.” 

“Why no tracks, though?” 

“The wind must have blown 
snow over them.” 

“And not the others?” He shook 
his head. “No, I don’t think so. I 
just want to go on the record as 
interested in the answer to that 
one too, if you ever do want to 
tell me about things.”

“I will remember,” I said. 

“Yes,” he said. “But I 
wonder. I’ve a peculiar feeling 
that I may never see you again. It 
is as if I were one of those minor 
characters in a melodrama who 
get shuffled offstage without ever 
learning how things turn out.’ 

“I can appreciate the feeling,” I 
said. “My own role sometimes 
makes me want to strangle the au- 
thor. But look at it this way: in- 
side stories seldom live up to 
one’s expectations. Usually they 
are grubby little things, reducing 
down to the basest of motives 
when all is known. Conjectures 
and illusions are often the better 
possessions.” 

He smiled. 

“You talk the same as always,” 
he said, “yet I have known occa- 
sions when you have been tempt- 
ed to virtue. Several of 
them. .” 

“How did we get from the foot- 
prints to me?” I said. “I was 
about to tell you that I suddenly 
recalled having approached the 
house by exactly the same route 



143 





as I left it. My departure obvi- 
ously obliterated the signs of my 
arrival.” 

“Not bad,” he said. “And vour 
attacker followed the same 
route?” 

“Must have.” 

“Pretty good,” he acknowl- 
edged. “You know how to raise a 
reasonable doubt. But I still feel 
that the preponderance of evi- 
dence indicates the weird.” 

“Weird? No. Peculiar, perhaps. 
A matter of interpretation.” 

“Or semantics. Have you read 
the police report on your acci- 
dent?” 

“No. Have you?” 

“Uh-huh. What if it was more 
than peculiar? Then will you grant 
me my word, as I used it: 
‘weird’?” 

“Very well.” 

“. .And answer one ques- 
tion ?“ 

“I don’t know. .” 

“A simple yes-or-no question. 
That’s all. 

“Okay, it’s a deal. What did it 
say?” 

“It said that they received re- 
port of the accident and a patrol 
car proceeded to the scene. There 
they encountered a strangely 
garbed man in the process of giv- 
ing you first aid. He stated that 
he had pulled you from the 
wrecked car in the lake. This 
seemed believable in that he was 
also soaking wet. Average height, 
light build, red hair. He had on a 
green outfit that one of the offi- 
cers said looked like something out 
of a Robin Hood movie. He re- 
fused to identify himself, to ac- 
company them or to give a state- 



ment of any sort. When they in- 
sisted that he do so, he whistled 
and a white horse came trotting 
up. He leaped onto its back ana 
rode off. He was not seen again.” 

I laughed. It hurt, but I 
couldn’t help it. 

“I’ll be damned!” I said. 
“Things are starting to make 
sense.’ 

Bill just stared at me for a mo- 
ment. Then, “Really?” he said. 

“Yes, I think so. It may well 
have been worth getting stabbed 
and coming back for what I 
learned today.” 

“You put the two in peculiar 
order,” he said, massaging his 
chin. 

“Yes, I do. But I am beginning 
to see some order where I had 
seen nothing before. This one 
may have been worth the price of 
admission, all unintended.’ 

“All because of a guy on a 
white horse?” 

“Partly, partly. Bill, I am 
going to be leaving here soon — ” 
“You are not going anywhere 
for awhile.” 

“Just the same — those papers 
ou mentioned. I think I had 
etter get them signed today.” 

“All right. I’ll get them over 
this afternoon. But I don’t want 
you doing anything foolish.” 

“I grow more cautious by the 
moment,” I said, “believe me.” 

“I hope so,” he said, snapping 
his briefcase shut and rising. 
“Well, get your rest. I’ll clear 
things up with the doctor and 
have those papers sent over 
today.” 

“Thanks again.” 

I shook his hand.

“By the way,” he said, "you did 
agree to answer a question.” 

“I did, didn’t I? What is it?” 
“Are you human?” he asked, 
still gripping my hand, no special 
expression on his face. 

I started in on a grin, then 
threw it away. 

“I don’t know. I — I like to 
think so. But I don’t really — Of 
course I am! That’s a silly. Oh 
hell! You really mean it, don’t 
you? And I said I’d be honest. .” 
I chewed my lip and thought for a 
moment. Then, “I don’t think so,” 
I said. 

"Neither do I,” he said, and he 
smiled. “It doesn’t make any real 
difference to me, but I thought it 
might to you — to know that 
someone knows ^ou are different 
and doesn’t care. ’ 

“I’ll remember that, too,” I 
said. 

"Well. See you around.” 
"Right.” 

IX. 

It was just after the State Pa- 
trolman left. Late afternoon, I 
was lying there feeling better, and 
feeling better that I felt better. 
Lying there, reflecting on the 
hazards involved in living in 
Amber. Brand and I were both 
laid up by means of the family’s 
favorite weapon. I wondered who 
had gotten it worse? Probably he 
had. It might have reached his 
kidney, and he was in poor condi- 
tion to begin with. 

I had stumbled across the room 
and back again twice before Bill’s 
clerk came over with the papers 
for me to sign. It was necessary 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



that I know my limits. It always 
is. Since I tended to heal several 
times faster than those about me 
in that shadow, I felt that I ought 
to be able to stand and walk 
some, to perform in the same 
fashion as one of these after, say, 
a day and a half, maybe two. I es- 
tablished that I could. It did hurt, 
and I was dizzy the first time, less 
dizzy the second. That was some- 
thing, anyway. So I lay there feel- 
ing better. 

I had planned the Trumps do- 
zens of times, dealth private sol- 
itaires, read ambiguous fortunes 
among familiar faces. And each 
time I had restrained myself, 
suppressing my desire to contact 
Random, to tell him what had 
happened, to inquire after new 
developments. Later, I kept tell- 
ing myself. Each additional hour 
they sleep is two and a half for 
you, here. Each two and a half for 
you, here, is the equivalent of 
seven or eight for some lesser 
mortal, here. Abide. Think. Re- 
gen rate. 

And so it came to pass that a 
little after dinnertime, just as the 
sky was darkening again, I was 
beaten to the punch. I had al- 
ready told a well-starched young 
member of the State Patrol every- 
thing that I was going to tell him. 
I have no idea whether he be- 
lieved me, but he was polite and 
he did not stay long. In fact, it 
was only moments after he left 
that things began to happen. 

Lying there, feeling better, I 
was waiting for Doctor Bailey to 
stop by ana check whether I was 
still oriented. Lying there, assess- 
ing all of the things Bill had told 



145 




me, trying to fit them together 
with other things that I knew or 
had guessed at. 

Contact! I had been antici- 
pated. Someone in Amber was an 
early riser. 

“Corwin!” 

It was Random, agitated. 
“Corwin! Get up! Open the 
door!Brand’s come around, and 
he’s asking for you.” 

“Have you been pounding on 
that door, trying to get me up?” 
“That’s reight.” 

“Are you alone?” 

“Yes. ’ 

“Good. I am not inside. You 
have reached me in Shadow.” 

“I do not understand.” 

“Neither do I. I am hurt, but I 
will live. I will give you the story 
later. Tell me about Brand.” 

“He woke up just a little while 
ago. Told Gerard he had to talk to 
you right away. Gerard rang up a 
servant, sent him to your room. 
When he couldn’t rouse you, he 
came to me. I just sent him back 
to tell Gerard I’d be bringing you 
along shortly.” 

“I see," I said, stretching slowly 
and sitting up. “Get in some place 
where you can’t be seen, and I’ll 
come through. I will need a robe 
or something. I am missing some 
clothes.” 

“It would probably be best if I 
went back to my rooms, then.” 
“Okay. Go ahead.” 

“A minute, then.” 

And silence. 

I moved my legs, slowly. I sat 
on the edge of the bed. I 
gathered up my Trumps and re- 
placed them in their case. I felt it 
important that I mask my injury 



back in Amber. Even in normal 
times one never advertises one’s 
vulnerability. 

I took a deep breath and stood, 
holding onto the bed frame. My 
practice had paid off. I breathed 
normally ana relaxed my grip. 
Not bad, if I moved slowly, if I 
did not exert myself beyond the 
barest essentials required for ap- 
pearances’ sake. I might be 
able to carry it until my strength 
really returned. 

Just then I heard a footfall, and 
a friendly nurse was frame in the 
doorway, crisp, symmetrical, dif- 
fering from a snowflake mainly in 
that they are all of them alike. 

“Get back in that bed, Mister 
Corey! You are not supposed to 
be_ up!” 

“Madam,” I said, “it is neces- 
sary that I be up. I have to go.” 

“You could have rung for a 
pan,” she said, entering the room 
and advancing. 

I gave my head a weary shake 
just as Random’s presence 
reached me once more. I won- 
dered how she would report this 
one — and if she would mention 
my prismatic afterimage as I 
trumped out. Another entry, I 
suppose, for the growing record of 
folklore I tend to leave behind. 

“Think of it this way, my dear,” 
I told her. “Ours has been a 
purely physical relatinship all 
along. There will be others. 
Many others. Adieu!” 

I bowed and blew her a kiss as 
I stepped forward into Amber, 
leaving her to clutch at rainbows 
as I caught hold of Random’s 
shoulder and staggered.

If you yearn for the sweet

ancestors, perhaps you too 
should take a look into — 

THE WALDEN 




1 HEY CALLED THE paleolithic 
flint-chipper Henry, and his 
shapeless wife Gertrude. There 
were also five children of various 
sizes. That gave the expedition a 
lot to observe. 

The three Windows that had 
been built were all clumsy de- 
vices that hadn’t justified the 
money the government had 
plowed into them. Hopes of spy- 
ing partriotically on the country’s 
enemies, or privately on some 
well-chosen friends, or scientifi- 
cally on the enigmas of history, 
were ended when it was 
mathematically demonstrated that 
each Window could show only a 
single segment of time and in 
each case the prehistoric past, and 
furthermore only the past of the 
particular spot in which the Win- 
dow was located in the twentieth 
century. Improvement of the pro- 
cess seemed impossible, so the 
project was canceled and the 
Windows were turned over to the 
paleo-anthropologists, who alone 
found some reason to rejoice. No, 
not quite alone. 

The present expedition con- 
sisted of six anthropologists, some 
graduate students as hewers of 
wood and drawers of water — and 
three professional movie camera- 
men. The costs of the expedition 
were being underwritten by a 
California film company, and this 
bothered Dr. Phillip Beldone, 
anthropologist-philologist. 

“Do we have to let those peo- 



ple get their fingers in, mucking 
things up?’ 

It was pointed out to him that 
the film company was paying the 
bills and supplying the best 
cameraman in the business, that 
the company had nothing to say 
about the direction of the expedi- 
tion, and that the serious re- 
searchers would get free processing 
for a year’s worth of film. 

“Yes,” Beldone said, “but we 
don’t have any control over the 
film they release. I’ll bet it comes 
out as a skin flick.” 

Beldone had been first a poor 
boy on the streets of New Y'ork 
and then a student at Oxford. 
He’d picked up a number of 
Britishisms there that he dropped 
into his sentences for effect. He 
was a good fellow, but he had 
some odd ideas. 

The Window was -in the body of 
a Land Rover parked near the 
front of the cave. The millenia 
and their glaciers had laid down a 
lot of rock and earth, so the ob- 
servers looked back through time 
from a perch twenty feet in the 
ancient air. Power was supplied 
through a line run up from the 
large generator down at the main 
camp by the river. 

The anthropologists directing 
filming served four-hour shifts, 
the cameramen eight hours. Half 
an hour before he was due to re- 
lieve his predecessor, Beldone 
came trudging up the hill in the 
dark, under his arm his private 



148 



GALAXY 




notebook, thick and well cared 
for. 

“Damn bloody television,” he 
said. “You go watch it if you 
want.” 

A certain vice president had 
dropped in last week, just to see 
how his boys were doing. Brought 
with him and left behind with a 
grand gesture was a large televi- 
sion set. Color, yet. It worked 
fine even here, making the 
graduate students happy. But not 
everyone, not Beldone. 

“What’s the matter, Phil?” 

"You’d think there’d be a place 
in the world where they couldn’t 
shove remedies for blocked nasal 
passages at you. In color, yet.” 

“Oh, Phil. Ought to be good for 
a chapter in your magnum opus, 
there. So use it. Turn dross into 
gold; of the spirit, I mean.” 

“I intend to. I shall.” Phil 
smiled just slightly, but he meant 
the words. 

“Goodnight now.” Smiling, the 
other scientist touched Phil’s arm 
and went out, closing the door 
behind him. The cameraman, 
whose name was P. Waner 
Byrd — his father had been a 
baseball fanatic — was sitting back 
in a swivel chair with one eye on 
the Window. He was an older and 
more leisurely man than Beldone. 

“Is anything happening?” Bel- 
done asked. 

“No, they’re just sitting around 
eating.” Byrd shrugged. “Nothing 
new.”

The Window’s viewing area 
measured somewhat larger than 
that of the television now display- 
ing nasal congestion to the main 
camp. The Window could be 
swung around a pivot in the mid- 
dle of the truck to provide a full 
three hundred sixty degree view. 
Through it now Henry and his 
family could be seen hunkered 
around the campfire eating. 
Henry was not clad in the bear- 
skin strongman’s outfit of the car- 
toons. He and all his clan wore 
tailored outfits of tanned hide that 
were functional if not pretty. 
From their communal bowl they 
ate meat brought home by Henry, 
stewed with roots collected by 
Gertrude and the children. In 
that longpast time there was 



THE WALDEN WINDOW

still daylight as they ate. 

Beldone pulled up his chair and 
sat down. When there was noth- 
ing doing in the Window he 
sometimes worked on his book 
(“A return on a higher plane to 
Thoreau, to the simple life”, he 
could say in his own mind and 
one day in print) but now he just 
held the notebook in his lap. 

Byrd asked: “What’s on the TV 
tonight?”. 

“We were watching an opera, 
for a while.” Some beautiful 
things would be lost to devotees 
of the Simple Life, because the 
price was too high. “It doesn’t 
matter. They spoil everything. Art 
one moment and armpits the 
next.” 

“Oh, the commercials? They’re 
not that bad,” Byrd said. “Some 
of them are funny and the rest 
you can ignore.” 

“Maybe so,” Beldone said. “I 
never could. I owned a telly once. 
And then one day I could feel the 
brainwashing beginning to get to 
me, and I broke the tube.” 

“You did?” 

“Yes.” Beldone smiled. “Just 
picked up a heavy glass ashtray 
and threw it. Made a most lovely 
noise.” 

Henry spoke to two of his 
middle-sized children and after a 
reluctant moment they picked 
down a hanging skin bag, stuck a 
stick through the thongs at its top 
so they could carry it between 
them, and set off downhill to the 



river, passing under the Window. 

“Chores,” said Byrd. “I wonder 
what they get for an allowance?” 
“Did you get an allowance 
when you were a kid?” 

“Yes.” 

“I never did. As a matter of 
fact, I turned over the money I 
made to my parents. You know. 
I’m growing to actually envy 
Henry and his family. The times 
are good. Life isn’t too hard. And 
they don’t have to put up 
with . ha. Television announc- 

ers.” 

Byrd smiled. “No Social Se- 
curity.” 

“No taxes.” 

“Yes,” Byrd said, “but I don’t 
imagine Henry will live much 
past forty, will he?” 

“No. You’re right, of course. 
But his is the world as man 
evolved to fit it, and that’s an ad- 
vantage we’ll never ...” 

Henry and Gert had jumped to 
their feet. A moment later the 
two children burst back on scene, 
wildly pointing and apparently 
yelling. They didn’t have the 
water bag with them. Henry 
grabbed up a spear. His older 
son, who perhaps came to his 
shoulder, did the same, standing 
a step behind his father. 

Beldone was up and watching 
intently. Byrd had switched on 
the camera. After the family had 
been caught in alert position, 
Gertrude shepherding the girls 
and the younger boy into the 



150 



GALAXY 




cave, Beldone said: “Let’s swing 
around and see what’s coming.” 

“Right.” 

Window and camrera swiveled 
to look down the hill. Climbing 
toward them were three people. 
Two were women, carrying packs. 
The third, a very large man, 
brought with him the filled 
waterbag, swinging it in one hand 
while he raised the other in a 
sign of peace. He had a couple of 
spears but they were slung on his 
back. He stumbled once, sloshing 
water on himself; the women with 
him tittered. 

“Who’s this?” Byrd wondered. 
“Relatives come to call?” 

“We’ll see.” Beldone lifted the 
phone and informed base camp of 
the new arrivals, while Byrd 
brought the Window round again 
and focussed on the cave mouth. 
The newcomers came into sight 
just below and halted there. 
Henry came slowly forward, spear 
ready, and he and the new man 
talked. Now and then Gertrude 
acted as barber for Henry, so 
most of his face was usually ex- 
posed; the newcomer had hair 
down past his shoulders, and a 
great bushy beard. He towered 
over Henry, but benignly. After 
they had talked for a couple of 
minutes, Henry waved the three 
forward to the fire, and called 
Gertrude. 

She came out of the cave, and 
with her oldest daughter bustled 
about adding reserve ingredients

to the stew. The older boy set 
down his spear and took the 
waterbag from the stranger’s 
peaceful hand. 

In the two months the expedi- 
tion had been observing this fam- 
ily, only once before they had vis- 
itors. Byrd was filming every 
moment. Beldone went up into 
the cab to move the Land Rover 
slightly for a better angle. 

Back in the rear, Beldone said: 
“Try for closeups of the new ones 
talking.” 

“That fella’s beard’ll cover a lot 
of lip movements.” 

“True, but the more talking 
mouths we can get on film the 
better our chance of cracking the 
language.” 

The new man had sat down 
crosslegged near the fire, facing 
the Window almost directly, to 
gobble some food. That chore out 
of the way, he belched, and 
wiped his mouth on his hand. 
Then, accommodating, he started 
talking. And he talked. He was a 
funny fellow, for Henry and Ger- 
trude soon were laughing. And 
the shy children gradually crept 
closer, watching with bright in- 
tent eyes as the bearded man 
chattered, waved his hands, 
waited for laughter. 

“I wonder who they are?” Byrd 
said. He was getting a lot of 
close-up footage. 

Beldone just shook his head. 

Bushy-Beard abruptly stopped 
his palaver and pulled from 



somewhere a small drum, which 
he tapped on while his two 
women got up to go capering 
around the fire. They hopped and 
jumped briskly in their shapeless 
leggings and jackets, shiny with 
grease. With their natural haircuts 
and gap-toothed smiles they did 
not seem particularly attractive to 
Beldone, but they did have a cer- 
tain sense of rhythm. When the 
first viewers from the main camp 
arrived at the LAND Rover, out 
of breath, cursing someone’s 
sprained ankle that had delayed 
them, Beldone just waved them 
inside while keeping a fascinated 
eye on the Window. 

The dance was cut off suddenly. 
The big man set the drum aside 
and stood up. Looming over 
Henry, he began to talk again, 
and this time all the lip move- 
ments showed clearly through the 
facial brush. 

“Phil, what — are you all right?” 

Beldone raised an imperative 
hand. 

Henry was standing now too, 
but retreating step by step. Spear 
not thought of, useless against this 
threat. The big man matched him 
step for step, advancing beard to 
beard, spraying words while with 
one hand he motioned his women 
forward with their packs. 

“Phil! What is it?” 

Phil was tearing pages from his 
notebook into little bits. His voice 
seemed changed. “What is it? It’s 
the bloody commercial!” +

Dear Mr. Baen, 

J.A. Lawrence's November story, “The 
Persistence of Memory,” deserves some 
comments on its biological heresies First, 
there is the misconception that having the 
same genetic makeup produces a psychic 
link between the people involved. This is 
not the first clone story which has used 
this idea, which is provably false. The 
proof lies in the existence of manv indi- 
viduals of identical genetic makeup (identi- 
cal twins) who show no such link. And the 
only difference between twins and clones 
is that the latter are an artificial creation of 
the former. 

Another idea without biological basis is 
the supposed effect of celibacy on the 
psy chic link of clones (or for that matter 
on any mental or physical process). Is 
there any physiological basis for such an ef- 
fect? I cannot think of one. May be an en- 
docrine imbalance could effect psychic 
contact but only temporarily. The real idea 
that Lawrence was probably driving at was 
that loss of celibacy means loss of some 
pristine and ideal state. I would add to 
these qualities intangible and immeasura- 
ble. 

I enjoyed the story. It was only after- 
wards that I got to thinking about the 
biology. 

“The Aerial Machine” by Herbie Bren- 
nan probably deserves classification with 
Chariots of the Cods. [.Vo , no! Anything 
but that! — Ed.] We poor stupid earthlings 
are constantly suckered in by these alien 
ploys. If aliens are interested in us, when 
they want us to know about them, we will 
know. One can only hope (for how could 
one prepare) that conquest is not the rule 



on other worlds. While we wait, specula- 
tion is always a bit chilling. 

Jerry Pournelle’s holographic brain 
model sounds right. But if a small portion 
of the holograph contains the whole pic- 
ture, why does increased brain capacity 
between species usually indicate increased 
intelligence? Surely no animal has a brain 
small enough to make the picture fuzzy. I 
would appreciate Jerry’s answer to this 
question. 

Congratulations on editing some fine 
magazines. Pool Anderson you have given 
us. Isaac Asimov you have given us. Dick 
Geis you have forced on us (Even though 
I enjoy every minute of his outrageous 
ideas). Here comes the suggestion. I want 
Heinlein. As publisher of the latest Hugo 
winning novel, Rendevous With Rama, 
you ought to be able to strike a deal with 
any author. Take heart! If you can get 
Clarke, you can get Heinlein. Say it over 
and over. Now do it. Please. [OK — I'll ash 
him. — Ed] 

If is the best SF magazine being pub- 
lished today and I have tried them all. 
Keep up the good work and don’t cut any 
more pages out of those magazines!

Perhaps the prior existence of a conscious 
entity produced by the same "genetic tem- 
plate would create a uniquely personal 
"psychic-field effect ” that would 
envelope-and thus conjoin-the clones in 
question? Also, Ms. iMwrence postulates 
identical memory-sets. 

Dear Jim, 

Thanks for sending me the August 
Galaxy. I’ve begun to read it, and I didn't 
find BEFORE THE REVOLUTION quite 
so bad — at the end she really had my 
sympathies for the old woman. I guess the 
only problem with this kind of story is that 
it’s cumbersome to read quite so much in- 
terior monologue unless it’s written with 
more zap. By contrast GARIGOLLI is 
terrific — just about the funniest thing I’ve 
read in a long time, a super-duper winner 
of a tale, extremely timely nowadays, 
especially from the point of view of a fed- 
eral official trying to find ways to recycle 
PE.

Poul Anderson’s article hit me between 
the eyes, in a way, because just before I 
read his ‘ cyclical theory," 1 finished a 
piece on this general subject — from a 
slightly different slant. My angle was that 
sf will become literature, someday. .and 
when it does, it’ll be a dead genre. Poul 
has obviously been dipping into Toynbee 
or Spengler or both — towering proponents 
of cyclical history, as evidenced both by 
KNIGHT OF GHOSTS AND SHADOWS 
and the sf article. I am also very in- 
terested in that concept. It’s a damn useful 
perspective for the luturistically oriented 
author. 



Some (non-exhaustive) comments about 
the October Galaxy. UNDER THE 
HAMMER — I was with Drake all the way. 
And suddenly the story ended, before I 
was ready for it to end, and I got the im- 

f iression that it was Chapter One of a 
onger work. Well done — but the real 
kudos, I think, go to Jack Gaughan. Tell 
Jack that the cover was magnificent! If you 

should run , Jack should be 

asked to do the art. 

EASY RIDER was fun — and I could just 
see you blow when RMN resigned! MAS- 
TER G made me thing of the movie Last 
Y'ear at Marienbad — a film I rather hated 
at first but later got to like. I guess the 
story depends on endless repetition to 
create a mood, and it’s an attempt at art, 
but for me it was a little long. The TWIST 
has my approval, and as for metal eating 
rocks on tne moon, I enjoyed having a 
sample of NASA-style sf before my eyes. 
Those 76-year old fans really ate it up, I’d 
uess. James Lacey tries what I usually 
on’t dare — creating a massive confusion 
from which he doesn’t entirely extricate us 
at the end. 



Incindentally, I liked Utley’s piece in 
August Galaxy — Utley is outdoing himself 
in creating hilarious, up-beat pieces! It’s 
certainly a step up from a woman with her 
guts hung up, on the way to becoming an 
android, to show us the start of the Uni- 
verse in a Big Bang with a priest fingering 
the erotic elbow of a female bee! Man 
alive! I liked it! 



So far I still like the October IF best of 
all your books. It’s superb through and 
through. Even the weakest piece (JULIE) 
isn’t so bad — and I got a really Big Bang 
out of DEATH AND TAXES. By the way, 
if you correspond with Colin Kapp — tell 
him from me that Mephisto is magnificent, 
as close to a perfect piece of sf as I’ve seen 
recently, meaning scientific theme, charac- 
ter, visual effects, and balanced story tel- 
ling. 



Please do not print any of my comments 
in your letter column unless they’re attri- 
buted to Charles Dickens, or something. 

Charles Dickens 

I've always wanted to attribute a letter to 
Charles Dickens. 

Dear Jim, 

Entropy can be reversed! After Fred 
Pohl quit as editor of Galaxy and If, both 
zines went to hell in a handbasket. Thanks 
to you, both are rising to their former 
levels of good and fun reading. I tip my 
space helmet to you. 

First of all, a variety of artists. Bravo! 
Jack Gaughan is a good SF artist, witness 
his cover and the showcase in the October 
issue of Galaxy, but he was being over 
worked. Fabian has always been good and 
several of your new illustrators show great 
promise. 

The quality of your stories has improved 
to the point where I expect you to be 
grabbing your fair share of the Hugo’s in 
times to come (now there is a phrase that 
sounds familiar). And I must compliment 
you on your features. 

Congratulations on your coup in signing 
Dick Geis on as a regular contributer. The 
last time something like that happened 
was when F&SF got Isaac Asimov as Sci- 
ence editor . [Take that, Geis! Ed.] 

I’d like to take him to point, however, 
on his October “Alien Viewpoint” column 
in If. 

Now, Dick’s alter-ego claims to want 
realism in SF stories, namely to make the 
characters more human. Ego seems to 
claim that to make characters believ- 
able, we must place human limitations on 
them, to wit, give them faults and foibles. 

Now I quote from Before the Golden 



155 




Age an afterword by Isaac Asimov: 

“That hero (of “Submieroscopic” and 
"Awlo of Ulm”) is rich, athletic, and the 
kind of square-shooter who longs to kill 
ants for sport, and who does kill an inof- 
fensive deer the instant he sees it, even 
though he is not hungry at the time and 
has no intention of eating it. , . 

There is love at first sight, the 

princess who acceps a strange adventurer 

as her husband 

.... The kind of tale in which virtue just 
happens to have stronger muscles, readier 
fists, and better weapons. .” 

A brief psychoanalytical look at the hero 
and heroine reveal them to be totally out 
of touch with reality, failing the grasp 
clear and present dangers, easily deceived, 
armed with cruel and vicious tempers, un- 
forgiving, sadistic, masocistic, immature 
psychotics who are quite impetuous, con- 
tradictory, and filled with dark compul- 
sions and obsessions. Is this human 
enough for alter-ego, Dick? 

Seriously, I think SF has produced 
some outstanding characters. Most have 
been larger than life, true, but then SF 
deals with larger than life issues. Name 
one mundane character who can equal 
Gully Foyle, Ben Reich, Prestign of Pre- 
stign, Lazarus Long, Rysfing, Sol 
Dagenheim, Valentine Michael Smith, or 
any Puppeteer. Larger than life situations 
call for larger than life characters. The 
common, everyday variety would shrivel 
up and die. 

Fortunately it was an extra-ordinary 
man who suffered a great personal tragedy 
and not an ordinary one, else Captain 
Nemo might have spent the rest of his life 
drifting through various gin shops cursing 
whatever government happened to be in 
power instead of building the Nautilus. 
Fortunately an extra-ordinary man was 
president of a port-Civil War veterans’ 
club instead of an ordinary one, else Impy 
Barbicane might have lobbied Congress 
instead of building the greatest cannon in 
the world and launching himself, two 
others, and the hopes of a nation to the 
moon. 

Realism’s great, but don’t forget that it 
takes a big (confidence) (wo)man to do a 
big job.

Dear Mr. Baen: 

1 just finished reading the October is- 
sues of IF and Galaxy and thought they 
were both superb. I had been thinking of 
letting my subscriptions to both lapse but 
now I wouldn’t think of doing so. Keep up 
the excellent work!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Now to the reasons that I’m writing. 
First, if “Yours in Christ, ]. Parker Wil- 
bern. Chairman, Federal City Conserva- 
tive Club” was so offended by Mack 
Reynolds’ Second Advent that he had to 
rip it out of the magazine why in the ex- 
pletive deleted is he reading science fiction 
in the first place! 

Second, I certainly agree with your 
statement, "Fandom: I will take famdon 
seriously as long as fandom does not re- 
turn the favor." I have been reading sci- 
ence fiction seriously for over twenty some 
years, and the few slight brushes that I 
nave had with fandom have left me with 
the opinion that famdom on a whole does 
not read science fiction because they are 
too busy going to conventions and discuss- 
ing it. 

Third, I also agree with your statement 
in your editorial, “No, when it comes to 
defining our field, intensive definitions 
don’t seem to work very well. They just 
build walls. Unnecessary' ones." 

Fourth and final, I absolutely adored 
your story, Mepltisto - The Ion Explorer 
by Colin Kapp. It was one ol the most 
beautiful stories I have ever read. Please 
tell Mr. Kapp that I would like to read 
more about Dr. Peter Lisbon. 

(Mrs.) Lois A. Anderson 

Thank you — and another on team story is 
in the works. 

Dear Sirs: 

Thank you for sending me the October 
issues of Galaxy and If, which I had re- 
quested in my last letter Irecause my sub- 
scription copies had not arrived — even 
though both issues had been on the news* 
, stands several weeks earlier. My subscrip- 
tion copies finally arrived. If I don’t re- 
ceive a request from you to ship them 
back, I will give the extra copies to friends 
to introduce them to these fine magazines. 

GALAXY 




Arsen Darnay's “The Eastcoast Con- 
finement ’ deserved to be the cover story 
in the October Galaxy. It’s by no means a 
totally original idea, but Mr. 
Damev’s writing skill made it a richly de- 
veloped story. This begs for expansion into 
a novel, with two parts to be developed 
further: the unification of the lour interior 
cultures, and the breakout. The first is 
easy to foresee, at least in outline. The 
second will take a lot of ihinkingout to 
reach a logically satisfying conclusion. I 
think Darnay should be encouraged to 
proceed. 

As an attorney specializing in federal 
taxation, I have some nits to pick with S. 
Roger Keith’s “Death and Taxes” in the 
October If. 1 assume Mr. Keith is an ac- 
countant, since his “notes’ are preapred by 
a C.P.A. But really', Mr. Keith — 25 
A . F T . R . 2d and 52 T.C. published in 
2196? These volumes were, in fact, pub- 
lished in 1970 and 1969, respectively. You 
should have computed the correct volume 
numbers for that year to maintain a con- 
vincing background to your case reports. 
Along the same line, the Tax Court has 
never affirmed or reversed a Circuit Court 
of Appeals, so the correct citation for your 
first case, for example, would be: Hegar t. 
Commissioner. 476 A.F.T. R.2d 95-392 (cd 
Cir. 2196), affg 502 T.C. 76 (2195). 

I have a more substantive objection to 
Mr. Keith’s third case. He apparently for- 
got to check the Citator for an update on 
his cases before he returned his page 
proofs to the printer; 537 Wires of Stud 
was reversed on certiorari by the Supreme 
Court under the rapid review procedures 
instituted by the Court in 2183. The Sec- 
ond Circuit opinion was manifestly in 
error, since a joint federal income tax re- 
turn when more than two spouses are fil- 
ing is by its very nature a consolidated re- 
turn: one return for everyone. In a joint 
return, each spouse gets a personal ex- 
emption ($3175 for the returns involved in 
this case), blit this is beside the point; 
federal law permits only one joint return, 
and on this return there is only one ocea-. 
sion to deduct the shared husband. The 
Second Circuit reached the right result, 
but its concept of 537 “joint” returns was 
absurd. 537 Wives of Stud v. Commis- 
sioner, 105 U.S.2d 453 (2196), re vg per 
curiam 263 F.4th 882 (2d Cir.). 

Is there any truth the to rumor that If is

Sirs, 

1 very' much enjoy your magazine, but 
who can wait two months for Part II of a 
novel? How long is it going to take us to 
get thru the middle fifth of Zelazny’s 
AMBER series? Torture, pure torture.

Besides having the pleasure of reading 
about Flandry’s faithful Chives serving 
Chateau Falkayn ’35, I really enjoy 
Anderson’s work. With the possible excep- 
tion of Tau Zero I have seen nothing of 
the future beyond Flandry’s declining 
Empire — for instance with Admiral 
McCormac’s group. Does he plan further 
human civilizations or other stories? 

I am very happy to see R.E. Geis with 
you — except that he can't seem to find 
time for his own zine now — or he doesn’t 
keep good subscription records for it.

Here'* how the Club works: 

When your application for 
membership is accepted, you’ll 
receive your choice of 4 books 
for just 100 plus shipping and 
handling. If not absolutely fas- 
cinated, return them within ten 
days — membership will be can- 
celled and you'll owe nothing. 
About every 4 weeks (14 times 
a year), we’ll send you the 
Club's bulletin. Things to 
Come, describing the 2 coming 
Selections and a variety of Al- 
ternate choices. If you want 
both Selections, you need do 
nothing; they’ll be shipped 
automatically. If you don't want 
a Selection, or prefer an Alter- 
nate, or no book at all, just fill 



out the convenient form al- 
ways provided, and return it 
by the date specified. We try to 
allow you at least ten days for 
making your decision. If you 
do not get the form in time to

receive unwanted books, re- 
turn them at our expense. 

As a member you need take 
only 4 Selections or Alternates 
during the coming year. You 
may resign anytime thereafter, 
or remain a member as long as 
you wish. Most books are 
only $1.98 plus shipping and 
handling. Some extra value 
selections are slightly higher 
but always much less than 
Publisher’s Editions. Send no 
money. But do send the cou- 
pon today.
