CAUSES 



W hat would you say caused 
World War I? 

Scihool children learn; “The 
First World War was caused by 
the assassination of the Arch- 
duke Ferdinand at Sarajevo . ” 
Military historians think it was 
because of the German General 
Staff’s erroneous appraisal of its 
strategy and strength. Others 
tell us it was because of Ger- 
many’s need for colonies . 
or because the build-up of ar- 
mies went so far that sooner or 
later they were bound to be 
used. 

Four different “causes”, you 
see. But which of them was the 
cause? 

There’s an important new 
book which casts light on this 
question. The name of it is Phili- 
sophical Foundations of Physics, 
by Rudolf Carnap, and it was 
called to our attention by its 
editor, Martin Gardner, a favor 
for which we are grateful. 

Does it answer the question 
raised above? Not exactly . 
but in the way we have come to 
expect scientific progress to re- 
solve questions, it disposes of it 
all the same — not by answering 
it, but by showing we are asking 
the wrong question. 



Carnap is a philosopher, and 
one of the characteristics of that 
trade is that its best practitioners 
are less interested in making you 
agree with their conclusions than 
they are in having you come to 
conclusions of your own. It is 
our conclusion (not necessarily 
Carnap’s) that to look for the 
“causes” of real-world events, 
and particularly of human events, 
is much like attempting to isolate 
the demons w'hich inhabit luna- 
tics. 

As Carnap says — speaking 
not of human events, but of 
science: “Exactly what does the 
cause-and-effect relation mean? 
In everyday life, the concept is 
certainly a vague one. Even in 
science, it is often not clear what 
a scientist means when he says 
that one event has ‘caused’ an- 
other . It is easy to see how 
men of primitive cultures could 
suppose that elements in nature 
were animated, as they them- 
selves were, by souls that willed 
certain things to happen.” 

A great deal of scientific 
thought is carried on by 
means of model-making. Some 
gifted people doubt the proprie- 
ty of this — there are dangers

in confusing the model with the 
real thing — but the process 
still goes on, very usefully and 
attractively, as it has since Euclid 
wrote his Elements 2200 years 
ago. With a mathematical model, 
or a logical model, or a geomet- 
ric model we can perform what- 
ever operations we like and be 
sure that the results will follow 
logically and causually from our 
assumptions. 

But this is only possible be- 
cause our assumptions are by 
definition true. We don’t need 
to test them against observed 
“fact”, because logical modali- 
ties are all the “fact” we need 
for logical systems. In this way 
we can make the calculation that 
out of a suitably large number 
of spins of a balanced coin, half 
will be heads and half will be 
tails. (If we make the actual 
test and find the results come 
out wrong, so powerful is the 
model that we at once realize 
the coin could not have been 
“balanced”.) Similarly we de- 
duce that the sum of the angles 
of a triangle must be exactly 
180°. We might test it, if we 
wish to — Carl Gauss is sup- 
posed to have tried it with three 
mountains in Germany — but 
even if we were to find a dis- 
crepancy it would not interfere 
with the workings of the model. 
High-school students would still 



be able to do their trig homework 
according to the same Euclidean 
laws. 

But of course, if we found out 
that large triangles were differ- 
ent from those we experience in 
daily life in that respect, we 
might begin to suspect that there 
was not really a one-to-one cor- 
respondence between model and 
reality. And so there is not. Log- 
ical modalities do not necessar- 
ily operate in the real world. As 
Einstein said, “So far as the 
theorems of mathematics are 
about reality, they are not cer- 
tain. And so far as they are cer- 
tain, they are not about reality.” 

S o what caused World War I? 

Well, that’s a question 
we’re not prepared to answer 
definitely. But we have a no- 
tion that it was caused largely 
by causality. People in authority, 
making models, imposing con- 
cepts of causality on the real 
world of human events, came to 
certain conclusions about what 
would happen if. 

Turned out they were wrong. 
Things didn’t happen as they 
planned — and a great many 
people died in the collapse of 
their models. 

And we have a notion, too, 
that if World War III comes, it 
may come about in much the 
same way. —THE EDITOR

PART ONE 



THE 

PALACE 
OF LOVE 

by JACK VANCE 



Illustrated by MORROW 



Kirth Gersen was pledged to murder 



the man he hated 
one whose cruelest 



I 

X Then one asked Kirth Ger- 
^ ’ sen to explain the drives 
which led him across the galaxy, 
he found it difficult. He was 
gentle . but he was a killer. 



. especially the 
weapon was love! 



He was urbane, informed and 
cultured . but he was remorse- 
less. To questions about the 
seeming contradictions of his 
character, he would respond: 
“There’s really no mystery. 
I’ve been trained to a certain 



8 



function. It’s all I know. To 
justify the training, to fulfill my 
life, I exercise the function. It’s 
as simple as that.” 

To one who knew the general 
outlines of Gersen’s past, this 
explained much. The five “De- 
mon Princes” joining for the his- 
toric raid on Mount Pleasant 
Iiad destroyed or enslaved five 
thousand men ' and women. 
Among the handful of survivors 
were Rolf Gersen and his young 
grandson. Such an experience 
must alter anyone’s life; yet 
others had known tragedy and 
terror but were not changed, 
felt neither rage nor hate. 

“My grandfather felt the rage 
and hate,” Kirth Gersen would 
reply in rather a flippant tone of 
voice. “So far as I’m concerned 
the hate is abstract.” 

This could be even more dis- 
turbing to a questioner: “Are 
you then just a mechanism? 
This is mindlessness, to be the 
instrument of someone else’s 
hate!” 

The answer — with a grin: 
“That’s not quite accurate. My 
grandfather trained me or, rath- 
er, had me trained, and I am 
grateful to him. Without the 
training, I would be dead.” 
“Fie must have been a terri- 
ble man, so as to warp a child’s 
mind!” 

“Fie was a dedicated man. Fie 
loved me and assumed I shared 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



his dedication. I did and I do.” 
“But what of the future? Is 
revenge all you want from life?” 
“ ‘ Revenge’? I don’t think so. 
I have only one life to live and 
I know what I hope to achieve.” 
“But why not try to achieve 
the same goals through a law- 
ful agency? Isn’t this a better 
way?” 

“There isn’t any lawful agen- 
cy. Only the IPCC, which isn’t 
altogether effective.” 

“Then why not bring the is- 
sues before the people of the 
Concourse, and the other im- 
portant worlds? You have the 
energy; you have more than 
enough money. Isn’t this better 
than killing men with your own 
hands?” 

Then Gersen had no rational 
counter-arguments. “These 
aren’t my talents,” he would say. 
“I work alone, at what I do 
best.” 

II 

^n the practice of “what he did 
^ best” Kirth Gersen approach- 
ed the planet Aloysius. 

Landing formalities at Aloy- 
sius were as rigorous as those of 
Sarkoy were lax. At a distance 
of a million miles, the “first 
shell”, Gersen announced his in- 
tention to land, identified him- 
self and his ship, gave references, 
explained the reasons for his 

9 



visit and was allowed to ap- 
proach the “second shell” at a 
distance of a half million miles. 
Here he waited while his appli- 
cation was studied, his refer- 
ences checked. He was then or- 
dered down into the “third 
shell” a hundred thousand miles 
above the planet, and here, af- 
ter a brief delay, he was given 
landing clearance. 

The formalities were irksome, 
but not to be avoided. Had Ger- 
sen neglected to halt at the first 
shell, weapons would have been 
trained on his ship. Had he fail- 
ed to heed the second shell, a 
Thribolt gun would have fired 
a salvo of adhesive paper disks 
at his ship. He had then failed to 
halt, he and his ship would have 
been destroyed. 

Gersen complied with all nec- 
essary regulations, received 
clearance and landed at the Dor- 
gan Central Spaceport. 

New Wexford lay twenty miles 
north, a city of crooked streets, 
steep hills and old buildings of 
almost medieval aspect. The 
banks, brokerage houses, ex- 
changes occupied the center of 
the city, with hotels, shops and 
agencies on the surrounding hills, 
and some of the finest private 
homes in the Oikumene scattered 
about the surrounding country- 
side. 

Gersen checked into the vast 
Congreve Hotel, bought news- 
10 



papers, ate a placid lunch. The 
life of the city flowed past him: 
mercantilists in their conscious- 
ly archaic garb; aristocrats from 
Boniface, anxious only to re- 
turn; occasionally a citizen of 
Cuthbert, conspicuous for the ec- 
centric flair of his garments and 
his glossy depilated head. Earth- 
folk at the Congreve could be 
identified by somber garments 
and an indefinable self-assur- 
ance — a quality the citizens of 
the outer worlds found exasper- 
ating, no less than the geocentric 
term “outer worlds” itself. 

Gersen relaxed. The atmos- 
phere of New Wexford was 
soothing. Everywhere were re- 
assuring evidences of solidity, 
good-living, law and order. He 
liked the steep streets, the stone 
and iron buildings, which now, 
after more than a thousand 
years, could no longer be deni- 
grated as “self-conscious quain- 
terie”, the Cuthbertian epithet. 

/^ersen had paid one previous 
visit to New Wexford. Two 
weeks of discreet investigation 
had pointed to one Jehan Ad- 
dels of Trans-Space Investment 
Corporation as an economist of 
extraordinary resource and acu- 
men. Gersen had called Addels 
by public telephone, blanking his 
own image. Addels was a young- 
ish man, slight of body, with a 
long quizzical face, a balding 

GALAXY 



scalp which he had not 
troubled to have rehaired. “Ad- 
dels here.” 

“I am someone you don’t 
know; my name is irrelevant. I 
believe you are employed by 
Trans-Space?” 

“Correct.” 

“How much do they pay 
you?” 

“Si.xty thousand, plus some 
fringe benefits,” Addels replied 
without embarrassment, though 
lie was talking to a stranger over 
a blank screen. “Why?” 

“I’d like to hire you in a sim- 
ilar capacity at a hundred 
thousand, with a monthly raise 
of a thousand and a bonus every 
five years of, say, a million 
SVU.” 

“The terms are appealing,” 
Addels replied drily. “Who are 
you?” 

“I prefer to remain anony- 
mous,” said Gersen. “If you in- 
sist, I’ll meet you and explain 
as much as you like. Essential- 
ly, what you need to know is 
that I am not a criminal. The 
money I want you to handle has 
not been acquired contrary to 
the laws of New Wexford.” 

“Hm. How much is the sum 
in question? What securities are 
represented?” 

“Ten billion SVU, in cash.” 

“Whisht!” breathed Jehan Ad- 
dels. “Where — ” a flicker of 
annoyance crossed his face, and 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



he broke off his sentence: Jehan 
Addels liked to think of himself 
as imperturbable. He continued. 
“This is an extraordinary amount 
of money. I can’t believe it was 
accumulated by conventional 
means.” 

“I haven’t said this. The mon- 
ey came from Beyond, where 
conventions don’t exist.” 

Addels smiled thinly. “And no 
laws. Hence, no legality. And no 
criminals . Still, the source 
of your funds is no concern of 
mine. Exactly what do you wish 
done?” 

“I want the money invested to 
yield income, but I want to call 
no attention to the money. I 
want no rumors, no publicity. I 
want the money invested with- 
out causing even a ripple of no- 
tice.” 

“Difficult.” Addels reflected a 
moment. “Not impossible, how- 
ever, if the program is proper- 
ly planned.” 

“This is at your discretion. 
You will control the entire oper- 
ation, subject to an occasional 
suggestion from me. Naturally 
you may hire a staff, though the 
staff is to be told nothing.” 

“Small problem there. I 
know nothing.” 

“You are agreeable to my 
terms?” 

“Certainly, if the whole busi- 
ness is not a hoax. I can’t avoid 
becoming an extremely wealthy 

11 



man, both from my salary and 
from investments I can make 
collateral with yours. But I will 
believe it when I see the money. 
Presumably it is not counter- 
feit.” 

“Your own fake-meter will as- 
sure you of this.” 

“Ten billion SVU,” mused 
Addels. “An enormous sum, 
which might well be expected to 
tempt even an honest man. How 
do you know I won’t embezzle 
from you?” 

“I understand that you are 
not only a cautious man, but a 
man of discipline. Also, you 
should have no inducement to 
embezzle. Otherwise I have no 
safeguards.” 

Jehan Addels gave his head a 
crisp nod. “Where is the mon- 
ey?” 

“It will be delivered wherever 
you like. Or you can come to 
the Congreve Hotel and pick it 
up yourself.” 

“The situation is not all that 
simple. Suppose I should die 
overnight? How would you re- 
cover your money? If you should 
die, how would I learn of the 
fact?. What disposition would I 
then make of this vast sum, pre- 
suming that it exists?” 

“Come to Suite 650 at the 
Congreve Hotel. I’ll give you 
the money, and we’ll make ar- 
rangements for any immediate 
contingencies.” 

12 



J ehan Addels appeared in Ger- 
sen’s suite half an hour later. 
He inspected the money which 
was contained in two large cases, 
checked a few of the notes with 
his fake-meter, and shook his 
head in awe. “This is a tremen- 
dous responsibility. I could give 
you a receipt, but it would be a 
meaningless formality.” 

“Take the money,” said Ger- 
sen. “Tomorrow, include in 
your will an instruction that in 
the event of your death the mon- 
ey is mine. If I die, or if I do not 
communicate with you within a 
year, use the income for chari- 
table purposes. But I expect to 
be back in New Wexford with- 
in two or three months. Here- 
after, I will communicate with 
you only by telephone, using the 
name Henry Lucas.” 

“Very well,” said Addels, rath- 
er heavily. “I think this takes 
care of all contingencies.” 

“Remember, absolute discre- 
tion! Not even your family must 
know the details of your new 
occupation.” 

“As you wish.” 

The next morning Gersen de- 
parted Aloysius for Alphanor; 
now, three months later, he was 
back in New Wexford, again at 
the Congreve Hotel. 

Going to a public telephone, 
blanking the screen as before, 
he tapped out Jehan Addels’s 
call-number. The screen burst 

GALAXY 



into a pattern of green leaves 
and pink briar roses. A female 
voice spoke: “Braemar Invest- 
ment Company.” 

“Mr. Henry Lucas to speak 
to Mr. Addels.” 

“Thank you.” 

“Addels’s face appeared on the 
screen. “Addels.” 

“This is Henry Lucas.” 
Addels leaned back in his 
chair. “I am happy — and I may 
say relieved — to hear from 
you.” 

“The line is clear?” 

Addels checked his anti-eaves- 
drop meter and blinker light. 
“All clear.” 

“How are matters progress- 
ing?” 

“Well enough.” Addels pro- 
ceeded to describe his arrange- 
nunts. He had paid the cash into 
ten numbered accounts in as 
many hanks, five in New Wex- 
ford, five on Earth, and was 
gradually converting the cash 
into income-producing invest- 
ments, using enormous delicacy 
to avoid sending tremors along 
the sandpapered nerves of the 
financial world. 

“1 had not comprehended the 
magnitude of the job when I 
undertook it,” said Addels. “It 
is simply staggering! Mind you, 
I am not complaining! I could 
not ask for a more interesting 
or more challenging job. But in- 
vesting ten billion SVU discreet- 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



ly is like jumping into water ^ 
without getting wet. I am put- j 
ting together a staff merely to <. 
handle details of investigation 
and management. Eventually, 
for maximum efficiency, I think 
we will be forced to become a 
bank, or perhaps several banks.™ 
“Whatever is most appropri- 
ate,” said Gersen. “In the mean- 
time I have a special job for 
you.” 

Addels instantly became wary. 
“And what is this job?” 

“Recently I’ve been reading 
that the Radian Publishing 
Company, which publishes Cos- 
mopolis, is in financial difficul- 
ties. I would like you to buy 
control.” 

Addels pursed his lips. “I can 
do this without difficulty, of 
course. In fact, I can buy out- 
right. Radian is on the verge 
of bankruptcy. But you should 
know that, as an investment, this 
is not an attractive buy. They 
have been losing money steadily 
for years, which of course is 
why they can be had so easily.” 
“In this case we will buy as 
a speculation and try to put 
things right. I have a particular 
reason in wishing to own it.” 
Addels hastily disavowed any 
intent to act counter to Gersen’s 
wishes. “I merely want you to 
be under no misapprehensions. I 
will start acquiring Radian stock 
tomorrow.”

Ill 

■jVyTurchison’s Star, Sagitta 203 
the Star Directory, lay 
out in the galactic plane be- 
hind Vega, thirty light-years be- 
yond the Pale. It was one of a 
cluster of five vari-colored suns: 
two red dwarfs, a blue-white 
dwarf, a peculiar unclassifiable 
blue-green star of medium size 
and a yellow-orange G6, which 
was Murchison’s Star. Murch- 
ison, the single planet, was some- 
what smaller than Earth, with a 
single huge continent cincturing 
the world. A searing wind blew 
dunes around the equatorial 
zone, mountainous highlands 
sloped gradually to the polar 
seas. In the mountains lived 
aborigines, black creatures of 
unpredictable characteristics. By 
turns they were murderously 
savage, torpid, hysterical or co- 
operative. In the latter mood 
they served a useful purpose, 
supplying dyes and fibers for the 
tapestries which were one of 
Murchison’s principal exports. 

The factories which produced 
the tapestries were concentrated 
about the city Sabra and em- 
ployed thousands of female op- 
eratives. These were supplied by 
a dozen slaving concerns, chief 
among whom was Gascoyne the 
Wholesaler. By virtue of effi- 
cient inventory control Gascoyne 
was able to give his customers 
14 



efficient service at reasonable 
prices. He made no effort to 
compete with the specialty hous- 
es and dealt mainly in slaves in 
the Industrial and Agricultural 
classifications. At Sabra his prin- 
cipal business was in Industrial 
F-2 Selecteds: women unpre- 

possessing or past the first bloom 
of youth, but warranted to be of 
good health and agility, coopera- 
tive, diligent and amiable. Such 
were the terms of Gascoyne’s 
Ten-Point Guaranty. 

In two such slaves, Kirth Ger- 
sen hoped to find a clue to an- 
other of the Demon Princes. 

Sabra, on the shore of the 
north polar sea, was a drab hap- 
hazard city with a heterogeneous 
population whose main goal was 
to earn sufficient money to go 
elsewhere. The coastal plain to 
the south was studded with hun- 
dreds of peculiar volcanic stubs, 
each crowned with a bristle of 
liver-colored vegetation. 

Sabra’s single distinction was 
Orban Circus, an open area at 
the heart of the city centered on 
one of these volcanic stubs. The 
Grand Murchison Hotel occu- 
pied the crest of the stub; around 
the circus were the most impor- 
tant establishments of the plan- 
et: Wilhelm’s Trade Hotel, the 
Tapestry Mart; the depot of 
Gascoyne the Wholesaler, Oden- 
our’s Technical Academy, Cady’s 
Tavern, the Blue Ape Hotel, the 

GALAXY 



Hercules Import Company, the 
warehouse and showroom of the 
Tapestry Producer’s Coopera- 
tive, the Sportsman Supply and 
Trophy House, Gambel’s Space- 
Ship Sales, the District Victual- 
ling Company. 

Sabra was a city large enough 
and wealthy enough to need pro- 
tection from raiders and free- 
booters, even though it fulfilled 
fi service to the folk who lived 
beyond the Pale. Thribolt bat- 
teries were constantly manned 
l)y members of the City Militia, 
and ships coming in from space 
wtre regarded with intense sus- 
picion. 

^ ^ ersen, approaching with cir- 
cumspection, radioed down 
to the spaceport and was direct- 
ed into a landing orbit. At the 
spaceport he. was subjected to 
inteiTogation by members of the 
local Deweaseling Brigade, who 
were reassured by Gersen’s Pha- 
raon. Weasels — the agents of 
the IPCC — uniformly travel- 
ed space in Locater 9B’s; these 
were the only ships the IPCC 
chose to risk Beyond. 

Gersen for once could afford to 
be candid. He stated that he had 
come to Sabra to locate a woman 
brought here twenty or more 
years bcfoi'e by Gascoyne the 
Wholesaler. The Deweaselers, 
watching the pips and bulbs on 
their truth machine, exchanged 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



sardonic glances, amused by this 
excess of quixotry, and waved 
Gersen forth to the freedom of 
the city. 

The time was midmorning. ■ 
Gersen registered at the Grand 
Murchison Hotel on top of the 
Orban Stub, which was crowded 
almost to capacity with tapestry 
buyers, commercial salesmen 
from the Oikumene and sports- 
men intent on stalking the Bower 
Mountain aborigines. 

Gersen bathed and changed 
into a local costume of scarlet 
plush pantaloons and a black 
jacket. Descending to the dining 
room he ate a lunch of local sea 
produce: seaweed salad, a dish 
of local molluscs. Directly be- 
low was the depot and offices of 
Gascoyne the Wholesaler: a 

rambling structure of three stor- 
ies enclosing a central courtyard. 
An enormous pink and blue sign 
across the facade read: 

GASCOYNE’S MART 
Select Slaves for any Purpose 

with a pair of handsome women 
and a stalwart man depicted be- 
low. At the bottom of the sign 
a message read: Gascoyne’s 10- 
Poini Warranty is Justly Pam~ 
oasl 

Gersen finished his lunch, des- 
cended to the circus and started 
to walk over to Gascoyne’s 
Mart.

T Te was lucky enough to find 

-*■ Gascoyne himself available 
and was ushered into a private 
office. Gascoyne was a hand- 
some, well-built man of indeter- 
minate age, with dark curly hair, 
a dashing black mustache, ex- 
pressive eyebrows. His office was 
simple and informal, with a bare 
floor, an old wooden desk, an in- 
formation screen showing evi- 
dence of much use. On one wall 
hung a plaque with Gascoyne’s 
famous ten-point guaranty 
limned in gold leaf and surround- 
ed by scarlet festoons. 

Gersen explained the purpose 
of his visit. “About twenty-five 
years ago, give or take five years, 
you visited Sarkovy, where you 
bought a pair of women from a 
certain Kakarsis Asm. Their 
names were Inga and Dundine. I 
am anxious to locate these wom- 
en. Perhaps you would be good 
enough to search them out in 
your records.” 

“Gladly,” said Gascoyne. “I 
can’t say as I recall the circum- 
stances, but — ” He went to the 
information bank, worked the 
knobs and dials a moment, evok- 
ing flashes of blue light and a 
sudden grinning visage which 
flickered away. Gascoyne shook 
his head despondently. “Might as 
well be a stone for all the use 
it gives me. I must have it re- 
paired . Well, we shall see. 
This way, if you please.” He 
16 



took Gersen into a back room 
lined with ledgers. “Sarkovy. I 
go there seldom. A pestilent 
world, the home of a wicked 
race!” He searched his ledgers, 
one year after another. “This 
must be the trip. So long ago! 
Thirty years! Now, let us look. 
My, my, how this old ledger 
brings back the memories! ‘Good 
old days’ is not just a banality 
. What were the names 
again?” 

“Inga, Dundine. I don’t know 
their last names.” 

“No matter. Here they are.” 
He copied numbers upon a slip 
of paper, went to another ledger, 
turned to the numbers in ques- 
tion. “They were both sold here 
on Murchison. Inga went to 
Qualag’s Factory. You know 
where that is? Third along the 
right bank of the river. Dun- 
dine went to Juniper Factory, 
across the river from Qualag’s. 
I trust these women were not 
friends or relatives? Like any 
other, my business has its dis- 
agreeable aspects. At Qualag’s 
and Juniper the women live 
wholesome productive lives, but 
certainly they are not pampered. 
Still, who is in this life?” And 
raising his eyebrows, he made 
a deprecatory gesture around his 
austere office. 

Gersen gave his head a wry 
shake of sympathy. He thanked 
Gascoyne and departed. 



GALAXY 



Q ualag’s Factory was a half- 
dozen four-story buildings 
around a compound. Gersen en- 
tered the lobby of the main of- 
fice, which was hung with sample 
tapestries. A pallid male clerk 
with varnished blond hair came 
to inquire his business. 

“Gascoyne tells me,” said Ger- 
sen, “that thirty years ago Qua- 
lag’s purchased a female named 
Inga, on your invoice 10V623. 
Can you tell me if this woman 
is still employed by you?” 

The clerk shuffled off to search 
his records, then went to an in- 
tercom and spoke a few words. 
Gersen waited. Into the office 
came a tall placid-faced woman 
with heavy arms and legs. 

The clerk said petulantly: 
“Gentleman here wants to know 
about Inga, B2-AG95. There’s a 
yellow card on her with two 
white clips but I can’t find the 
reference.” 

“You’re looking under Dormi- 
tory F. The B2’s are all Dorm 
A.” The woman located the cor- 
rect reference. “Inga. B2-AG95. 
Dead. I remember her very well. 
An Earthwoman giving herself 
all style of airs. Complained 
constantly of this and that. She 
came to the dye-works while I 
was recreation counsellor. I re- 
member her well. She worked in 
blues and greens, and it put her 
off; she finally threw herself 
into a vat of dusty-orange. 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



That’s long ago. My, how time 
flies.” 

Leaving Qualag’s, Gersen 
crossed the river by a bridge and 
walked to the Juniper Factory, 
which was somewhat larger than 
Qualag’s. The office was similar, 
though with a brisker atmos- 
phere. 

Gersen again put his question, 
this time in connection with 
Dundine. But the clerk was not 
cooperative and refused to check 
the records. “We aren’t allowed 
to give out such information,” 
said the clerk, looking disdain- 
fully at Gersen from the altitude 
afforded him by his position be- 
hind the counter. 

“Let me discuss the matter 
with the manager,” said Gersen. 

“Mr. Plusse owns the factory. 
If you will be seated I will an- 
nounce you.” Gersen went to 
examine a tapestry ten feet wide 
by six feet high, representing a 
flowered field on which stood 
hundreds of fanciful birds. 

“Mr. Plusse will see you, sir.” 

A yTr. Plusse was a small surly 
■^’■*-man with a white top-knot 
and eyes of blue agate. Clearly 
he had no intention of obliging 
Gersen or anyone else. “Sorry, 
sir! We have our production to 
consider. Trouble enough with 
the women as it is! We do our 
best for them; we provide good 
food and recreational facilities, 

17 



bathe them once a v^eek. Still 
it’s impossible to keep them sat- 
isfied.” 

“May I ask if the woman still 
works for you?” 

“It makes no difference if she 
does or not. You would not be 
allowed to disturb her.” 

“If she is here, if she is the 
woman I am looking for, I’ll be 
glad to recompense you for any 
inconvenience.” 

“Hmf. Just a moment.” Mr. 
Plusse spoke into the intercom. 
“Is not there a Dundine in wic- 
ker-stitching? What’s her current 
index? . Hmf ... I see.” He 
returned to Gersen, whom he 
now regarded in a thoughtful 
new light. “A valuable employee. 
I can’t have her badgered. If 
you insist on speaking to her, 
you’ll have to buy her. The 
price is three thousand SVU.” 

Without a word Gersen put 
down the money. Mr. Plusse 
licked his small pink mouth. 
“Hmf.” He spoke into the in- 
tercom. “With a minimum of 
commotion, bring Dundine to 
this office.” 

Ten minutes passed, while Mr. 
Plusse ostentatiously made no- 
tations on a chart. The door 
opened; the clerk entered with 
a large-bodied woman in a white 
smock. Her features were big 
and moist; her hair short, mouse 
brown, crimped and tied with 
string. Wringing her hands ap- 
18 



prehensively she stared from 
Mr. Plusse to Gersen and back 
again.” 

“You are leaving our service,” 
said Mr. Plusse in a dry voice. 
“This gentleman bought you.” 

Dundine looked at Gersen with 
bright fear. “Oh, what do you 
plan to do with me, sir? I’m use- 
ful and well here! I do my work. 
I don’t want to go out on the 
back farms. I wouldn’t want to 
do this, and I’m too old for 
barge work.” 

“Nothing like that, Dundine. 
I’ve paid Mr. Plusse off, you’re 
a free woman now. You can go 
back to your home if you like.” 

Tears sprang into her eyes. 
“I don’t believe it.” 

“It’s true.” 

“But — why did you do this?” 
Dundine’s face wavered between 
bewilderment and fear. 

“I want to ask you a few 
questions.” 

Dundine turned her back, bent 
her head over her hands. 

\ fter a moment Gersen asked, 
Is there anything you want 
to bring with you?” 

“No. Nothing. If I was wealthy 
I’d take that little tapestry on 
the wall, the little girls dancing. 
I did the wickering on that 
tapestry and I was all that fond 
of the thing.” 

“What - is the price?” Gersen 
asked Mr. Plusse. 



GALAXY 



“That is our Style 19, which 
is priced at 750 SVU.” 

Gersen paid 750 SVU and took 
the tapestry. “Come, Dundine,” 
he said shortly. “Best that we 
start off.” 

“But my good-bys! My dear 
friends!” 

“Impossible,” said Mr. Plusse. 
“Do you wish to disturb the 
other women?” 

Dundine sniffed and rubbed 
her nose. “There’s my bonuses I 
haven’t taken. It’s three recrea- 
tion half-periods. I’d like to give 
them to Almerina.” 

“That can’t be done, as you 
know. We never allow transfers 
or bartering of bonus units. If 
you wish, you may use them 
now, before your departure.” 
Dundine looked uncertainly 
toward Gersen. “Do we have 
time? It seems a shame to let 
them go to waste . but I sup- 
pose it makes no difference 
now.” 

They walked along the river 
road back toward the center of 
town, with Dundine casting tim- 
id glances toward Gersen. 

“I can’t imagine what you 
want of me,” she said tremulous- 
ly. “I’m certain I’ve never known 
you in my life.” 

“I’m interested in what you 
can tell me of Viole Falushe.” 
“Viole Falushe? But I know 
no such person. I can tell you 
nothing.” Dundine stopped short, 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



her knees shaking. “Are you go- 
ing to take me back to the fac- 
tory?” 

“No,” said Gersen hollowly. “I 
won’t take you back.” He look- 
ed at her in deep discourage- 
ment. “Aren’t you the Dundine 
who was kidnapped with Inga 
many years ago?” 

“Oh yes. I’m Dundine. Poor 
Inga. I’ve never heard of her 
since she went to Qualag’s. They 
say it’s ever so dreary at Qua- 
lag’s.” 

Gersen’s mind raced back and 
forth. “You were kidnapped and 
brought to Sarkovy?” 

“Yes, indeed, and oh, what 
a time we had! Riding the step- 
pes on those bouncing old wag- 
ons!” 

“But the man who kidnapped 
you and brought you to Sar- 
kovy — that was Viole Falushe, 
or so I am told.” 

“Him!” Dundine’s mouth twist- 
ed as if she had bitten into some- 
thing sour. “His name wasn’t 
Viole Falushe!” 

And Gersen belatedly recalled 
that his informant, Kakarsis 
Asm, had told him the same. The 
man who had sold Inga and 
Dundine had not used the name 
“Viole Falushe” at that time. 

“No, no,” said Dundine in a 
soft voice, looking far back down 
her life. “That wasn’t any Viole 
Falushe. It was that nasty little 
Vogel Filschner.” 

19 



IV 

\ 11 the way back into the 
Oikumene, in fragments and 
ejaculations, bits from here, odd- 
ments from there, Dundine told 
her story, and Gersen gave over 
trying to elicit a connected nar- 
rative. 

Expansive, inflated with free- 
dom, Dundine talked with en- 
thusiasm. She knew Vogel Fils- 
chner — yes, indeed! She knew 
him well. So he changed his 
name to Viole Falushe? Small 
wonder, after the shame his 
mother must feel. Though Ma- 
dame Filschner had never en- 
joyed the best of reputations, 
and no one had ever known Vog- 
el Filschner’s father. He had at- 
tended school with Dundine, two 
classes ahead. 

“Where was this?” asked Ger- 
sen. 

“Why, at Ambeules!” declared 
Dundine, surprised that Gersen 
did not already know the story as 
well as herself. Though Gersen 
knew Rotterdam, Hamburg and 
Paris, he had never visited Am- 
beules, a suburb of Rolingshaven 
on the west coast of Europe. 

Volgel Filschner had always 
been a strange, brooding boy, ac- 
cording to Dundine. “Extremely 
sensitive,” she confided. “Ripe 
always for a great rage or eye- 
fuls of tears. One never knew 
what Vogel might do!” And for 
20 



a space she fell silent, shaking 
her head in marvel at the deeds 
of Vogel Filschner. “Then when 
he was sixteen, and I but four- 
teen, a new girl came to school. 
Oh, she was a pretty thing! Jher- 
al Tinzy was her name, and who 
but Vogel Filschner should fall 
in love!” 

But Vogel Filschner was 
grubby and unsavory. Jheral 
Tinzy, a girl of sensitivity, found 
him repulsive. “WTio could 
blame her?” mused Dundine. 
“Vogel was an eerie boy. I can 
see him yet: tall for his age, 
and somewhat thin, with a round 
belly and a round bottom, like 
a billiken. He walked with his 
head to the side, watching all 
with his dark burning eyes! They 
watched, they saw all, they 
never forgot a thing — Vogel 
Filschner’s eyes! I must say that 
Jheral Tinzy used him heartless- 
ly, laughing and gay the while! 
She drove poor Vogel to desper- 
ation, this is my belief. And that 
man Vogel took up with - — I 
can’t recall his name. He wrote 
poetry, very strange and daring. 
He was thought ungodly, though 
he had patrons in the upper 
classes. Those days so long ago, 
so tragic and so sweet! Ah, if I 
could live them again, what 
changes there would be!” 

At this point Dundine went in- 
to a nostalgic reminiscence. 
“Even now I can smell the air 

GALAXY 



from the sea! Ambeules, our old 
district, is on the Gaas, and this 
is the loveliest part of the city, 
though by no means the richest. 
The flowers are unimaginable! 
To think that I have seen no 
flowers for thirty years, except 
for those I myself worked.” And 
now nothing must do but that 
Dundine should examine her 
tapestry which she had draped 
upon the back bulkhead of the 
saloon. 

■presently she returned to the 
subject of Vogel Filschner. 
‘‘The most morbidly sensitive of 
youths! The poet egged him on. 
And truth to tell, Jheral Tinzy 
humiliated Vogel dreadfully. 
Whatever the cause, Vogel per- 
formed his terrible deed. There 
were twenty-nine girls in the 
choral society. Every Friday 
night we sang. Vogel had learned 
to operate a spaceship — it was 
a course all the boys took. So 
Vogel stole one of those little 
Locater ships, and when we came 
out from choral practice to the 
bus, it was Vogel who drove us 
away. He took us to the space- 
ship and made us all get aboard. 
But it was the one night Jheral 
Tinzy had not come to practice. 
Vogel had no knowledge of this 
until the last girl left the bus, and 
he was like a stone statue. Too 
late then! He had no choice but 
to flee.” Dundine sighed. “Twen- 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



ty-eight girls, pure and fresh as 
little flowers. How he dealt with 
us! We knew he was strange, but 
ferocious as a wild beast? No, 
never. How could we girls im- 
agine such things? For reasons 
best known to himself he never 
used us in bed — Inga thought 
he was sulking because he had 
failed to capture Jheral. Godelia 
Parwitz and Rosamond — I can’t 
think of her name — they tried 
to hit him with a metal imple- 
ment, though it would have been 
the death of all had they suc- 
ceeded, for none of us knew how 
to guide the ship. He punished 
them in a dreadful manner so 
that they cried and sobbed. Inga 
and I told him he was a wicked 
monster to act so. He only 
laughed, did Vogel Filschner. ‘A 
wicked monster, am I? I’ll show 
you a wicked monster!’ And he 
took us to Sarkovy and sold us 
to Mr. Asm. 

“But first he stopped at an- 
other world and sold ten girls 
who were the least weU-favored. 
Then Inga and I and six others 
who hated him the most were 
sold on Sarkovy. Of the others, 
the most beautiful, I know noth- 
ing. Thanks to Kalzibah, I have 
been succored.” 

D undine wanted to return to 
Earth. At New Wexford 
Gersen furnished her a ward- 
robe, a ticket to Earth and funds 

21 



sufficient to keep her in com- 
fort the rest of her life. At the 
spaceport she embarrased him 
by falling on her knees and kiss- 
ing his hands. “I thought to die 
and have my ashes scattered on 
a far planet! How was I so 
lucky? With so many other poor 
creatures, why did Kalzibah 
select me for his favor?” 

The same question, in differ- 
ent terms, had been troubling 
Gersen himself. With his wealth, 
he might have bought the whole 
of Qualag and Juniper and every 
factory on Sabra and brought 
each of the wretched women to 
their homes. 

But what then? he asked him- 
self. Sabra tapestries were in de- 
mand. New factories would be 
established, new slaves import- 
ed. A year later all would be 
as before. 

Still . Gersen heaved a sigh. 
The universe abounded with 
evils. No one man could defeat 
them all. Meanwhile Dundine 
was wiping her eyes and appar- 
ently preparing to fall on her 
knees once more. Gersen said 
hastily, “One request I wish to 
make of you.” 

“Anything, anything!” 

“You plan to return to Roling- 
shaven?” 

“It is my home.’ ’ 

“You must not reveal how you 
were brought from Sabra. Tell 
no one! Invent any wild tale. But 
22 



do not mention me. Do not men- 
tion that I asked you of Vogel 
Filschner.” 

“Trust me! The fiends of hell 
can tear forth my tongue, even 
then I will not speak!” 

“Good-by then.” Gersen de- 
parted hastily before Dundine 
could again demonstrate her 
gratitude. 

At a public telephone he called 
Braemar Investment Company. 
“Henry Lucas to speak to Mr. 
Addels.” 

“A moment, Mr. Lucas.” 
Addels appeared on the 
screen. “Mr. Lucas?” 

Gersen allowed his image to 
go forth. “All continues to go 
well?” 

C t A s well as could be expect- 
ed. My problems arise 
only from the sheer mass of our 
money. I should say, your mon- 
ey.” Addels permitted himself to 
smile. “But gradually I am 
training an organization. Inci- 
dentally, Radian Publishing 
Company is ours. We had it 
cheaply, because of the circum- 
stances I mentioned previously.” 
“No one has been inquisitive? 
There have been no questions, 
no rumors?” 

“To the best of my knowledge, 
none. Zane Publishing Company 
bought Radian; Irwin and Jed- 
dah own Zane; a numbered ac- 
count at a Pontefract bank owns 

GALAXY 



Irwin and Jeddah. Braemar In- 
vestment is the numbered ac- 
count. Who is Braemar Invest- 
ment? Ostensibly it is I.” 

“Well done!” said Gersen. 
“You could not have managed 
better.” 

Addels acknowledged the 
praise with a stiff nod. “I must 
say once more that Radian seems 
a poor investment, at least on 
the basis of past performance.” 
“Why has it been losing mon- 
ey? Everyone seems to read Cos- 
mopolis. I see it everywhere.” 
“Perhaps this is so. Neverthe- 
less circulation has slowly been 
declining. More significantly, the 
typical reader no longer is a de- 
cision-maker. The management 
has been trying to please every- 
one, including the advertiser. As 
a result the magazine has lost its 
flair.” 

“There would seem to be a 
remedy for the situation,” said 
Gersen. “Hire a new editor, a 
man of imagination and intelli- 
gence. Instruct him to revitalize 
the magazine, without regard for 
advertisers or circulation, spar- 
ing no reasonable expense. When 
the magazine regains its prestige, 
circulation and advertisers will 
return fast enough.” 

“I am relieved that you pre- 
face the word ‘expense’ with 
‘reasonable’,” said Addels in his 
driest voice. “I still am not ac- 
customed to dealing with mil- 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



lions as if they were hundreds.” 

“No more am I,” said Ger- 
sen. “The money means nothing 
to me, except that I find it un- 
commonly useful. One other 
matter. Instruct the Cosmopolis 
head office — I believe it is lo- 
cated in London — that a man 
named Henry Lucas will be sent 
to the editorial offices. Represent 
him as an employee of Zane Pub- 
lishing if you like. He is to be 
put on the payroll as a special 
writer, who will work when and 
where he chooses, without inter- 
ference.” 

“Very well, sir. I will do as 
you require.” 

V 

ersen, who had lived nine 
years on Earth, nevertheless 
felt something of an outworlder’s 
exhilaration as he hung above 
the great globe awaiting his 
clearance from Space Security. 
Finally it arrived, with precise 
landing instructions, and Ger- 
sen dropped down to the West 
Europe spaceport at Tarn. He 
passed through sanitation proce- 
dures and health inspection, the 
most stringent of the Oikumene, 
punched appropriate buttons at 
the Immigration Control con- 
sole and finally was allowed to 
proceed about his business. 

He rode to London by tube 
and registered at the Royal Oak 

23 



Hotel, a block off the Strand. The 
season was early autumn; the 
sun shone through a high thin 
overcast. Old London, permeated 
with the vapors of antiquity, 
shone like a fine gray pearl. 

Gersen’s clothes were in the 
Alphanor style, fuller in cut and 
richer in color than the clothes 
of London. On the Strand he 
went into a gentleman’s outfit- 
ter, where he selected a fabric, 
then stripped to his underwear 
and was measured by photonic 
scanners. Five minutes later he 
was delivered his new garments: 
black trousers, a jacket of dark 
brown and beige, a white blouse 
and black cravat. Inconspicuous 
now, Gersen continued along the 
Strand. 

Dusk came to the sky. Every 
planet had its distinctive dusk, 
thought Gersen. The dusk of Al- 
phanor, for instance, was an elec- 
tric blue, gradually fading to the 
richest of ultramarines. Sarkovy 
dusk was a dead dismal gray, 
with a tawny overtone. Dusk at 
Sabra had been brown-gold, with 
domains of color around the 
other stars of the cluster. The 
dusk of Earth was dusk as it 
should' be: soft, heather-gray, 

soothing, an ending and a begin- 
ning. 

Gersen dined at a restaurant 
which had maintained an un- 
broken tenancy of over seventeen 
hundred years. The old oak 
24 



beams, fumed and waxed, were 
as stout as ever. The plaster re- 
cently had been scraped of 
twenty layers of white-wash and 
refinished, a process which oc- 
curred every hundred years or 
so. Gersen’s thought reverted to 
his youth. 

He had visited London twice 
with his grandfather, though for 
the most part they had lived at 
Amsterdam. There never had 
been dinners such as this, never 
leisure or idleness. Gersen shook 
his head sadly as he recalled the 
exercises to which his merciless 
grandfather had put him. A won- 
der that he had stood up to the 
discipline. 

Gersen bought a copy of Cos- 
mopolis and returned to the ho- 
tel. He went into the bar and, 
sitting at a table, ordered a pint 
of Worthington’s Ale, brewed at 
Burton-on-Trent as had been the 
case for some two thousand 
years. He opened Cosmopolis and 
glanced at the first page. 

It was easy to understand why 
the magazine had become mori- 
bund. There were three long 
articles: Have Earthmen Become 
Less Virile? Patricia Poitrine : 
New Toast of the Smart Set. A 
Clergyman’s Guide to Spiritual 
Renewal. 

Gersen flicked through the 
pages, then laid the magazine 
aside. He drained the mug and 
went up to his room. 



GALAXY 




I n the morning he visited the 
editorial offices of Cosmopolis 
and asked to speak to the per- 
sonnel director. This was Mrs. 
Neutra, a brittle black-haired 
woman wearing a great deal of 
preposterous jewelry. She show- 
ed no inclination to speak to 
Gersen. “Sorry, sorry, sorry. I 
can’t consider anything or any- 
one at this moment. I’m in a flap. 
Everybody’s in a flap. There’s 
been a shakeup; no one’s job is 
any good.’’ 

“Perhaps I had better speak 
to the editor-in-chief,” said Ger- 
sen. “There was to have been a 
letter from Zane Publishing, and 
it should have arrived.” 

The personnel director made 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



a gesture of irritation. “Who or 
what is Zane Publishing?” 

“The new owners,” said Ger- 
sen politely. 

“Oh.” The woman pushed 
among the papers on her desk. 
“Maybe this is it.” She read. 
“Oh. You’re Henry Lucas.” 
“Yes.” 

“Hmm . Piff puff . You’re 
to be a special writer. Something 
we just don’t need at the mo- 
ment. But I’m only Personnel 
Director. Oh hell, fill out the ap- 
plication, make an appointment 
for your psychiatric tests. If you 
survive, and you probably won’t, 
show up a week from tomorrow 
for your orientation course.” 
Gersen shook his head. “I 

25 



don’t have time for any of these 
formalities. I doubt if the new 
owners have much sympathy 
with them.” 

“Sorry, Mr. Lucas. This is our 
inflexible program.” 

“What does the letter say?” 
“It says to put Mr. Henry Lu- 
cas on the payroll as special 
writer.” 

“Then please do so.” 

“Oh, double bing-bang hell! 
If this is how things are going to 
go, why have a personnel direc- 
tor? Why have psychiatric tests 
and orientation courses? Why 
not just let janitors put out the 
rag?” 

The woman seized a form, 
wrote with swift strokes of a 
flamboyant quill-pen. “Here you 
are. Take it in to the managing 
editor, he’ll arrange your as- 
signment.” 

The managing editor was a 
portly gentleman with lips purs- 
ed in a worried pout. “Yes, Mr. 
Lucas. Mrs. Neutra just called 
me. I understand you have been 
sent here for a position by the 
new ownership.” 

“I’ve been associated with 
them for a long time,” said Ger- 
sen. “But all I want at this mo- 
ment is whatever identification 
you supply your special corres- 
pondents, so that if it ever be- 
comes necessary I can demon- 
strate that I’m an employee of 
Cosmopolis.” 

26 



''T^he managing editor spoke 
into an intercom. “On your 
way out, step into Department 
2A, and your card will be pre- 
pared.” He leaned morosely back 
into his chair. “It seems that you 
are to be a roving reporter, re- 
sponsible to no one. A very nice 
billet, if I may say so. What 
do you propose to write about?” 
“One thing or another,” said 
Gersen. “Whatever comes up.” 
The managing editor’s face 
sagged with bewilderment. “You 
can’t go out and write a Cosmo- 
polis article like that! Our issues 
are programmed months ahead! 
We use public opinion polls to 
find out what subjects people 
are interested in.” 

“How can they know what 
they’re interested in if they 
haven’t read it?” asked Gersen. 
“The new owners are throwing 
public opinion polls away.” 

The managing editor shook his 
head sadly. “How will we know 
what to write about?” 

“I have an idea or two. For 
instance, the Institute could 
stand an airing. What are its 
current aims? Who are the men 
of Degrees 101, 102, 103? What 
information have they suppress- 
ed? What of Tyron Russ and 
his anti-gravity machine? The 
Institute deserves a comprehen- 
sive study. You could easily de- 
vote an entire issue to the In- 
stitute.” 



GALAXY 



The editor nodded curtly. 
“Don’t you think it’s a bit — 
well, intense? Are people really 
interested in these matters?” 

“If not they should be.” 
“Easily said, but it’s no way 
to run a magazine. People don’t 
want to really understand any- 
thing. They want to think they 
have learned without the neces- 
sity of application. In our ‘heavy’ 
article we try to supply keys and 
guides, so at least they’ll have 
something to talk about at par- 
ties. But go on. What else do 
you have in mind?” 

“I’ve been thinking of Viole 
Falushe and the Palace of Love. 
Exactly what goes on at this es- 
tablishment? What face does 
Viole Falushe show, what name 
does he bear when he comes in 
from Beyond? Who are his 
guests at the Palace of Love? 
How have they fared? Would 
they care to return?” 

“An interesting topic,” the 
editor admitted. “A bit close to 
the knuckle perhaps. We prefer 
to stay away from sensational- 
ism and — shall we say? — the 
grim facts of reality. Still I’ve 
often wondered about the Palace 
of Love. What in the world does 
go on? The usual, I suppose. But 
no one knows for sure. What 
else?” 

“That’s all for now.” Gersen 
rose to his feet. “In fact, I’ll be 
working on this story myself.” 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



The managing editor shrugged 
his shoulders. “You seem to have 
a free hand.” 

ersen immediately rode the 
sub-channel tube to Roling- 
shaveri, arriving at the vast Zone 
Station a few minutes before 
noon. He crossed the murmuring 
white-tiled lobby, past slideways 
and escalators labeled WIEN, 
PARIS, TSARGRAD, BERLIN, 
BUDAPEST, KIEV, NEAPO- 
LIS, a dozen other ancient cities. 
He paused at a kiosk to buy a 
map, then went to a cafe and 
settled himself at a table with 
a stein of beer and plate of 
sausages. 

Gersen had lived long in Am- 
sterdam and had passed through 
the Zone Station on several oc- 
casions, but of the city Roling- 
shaven he knew little. As he ate 
he studied the map. 

Rolingshaven was a city of 
considerable extent, divided into 
four principal municipalities by 
two rivers, the Gaas and the 
Sluicht, and the great Evres Ca- 
nal. At the north was Zummer, 
a rather grim district of apart- 
ment towers and careful malls 
laid out by some neat-minded 
city council of the far past. On 
the Heybau, a promontory hook- 
ing out into the sea, was the fa- 
mous HandeUial Conservatory, 
the wonderful Galactic Zoo and 
the Kindergarten. Zummer other- 

27 



wise was lacking any interest. 

South, across the Sluicht was 
the Old City, a teeming confu- 
sion of small shops, inns, hos- 
tels, restaurants, beer caverns, 
bookstalls, huddled offices, as- 
kew little houses of stone and 
timber, dating from the Middle 
Ages. It was a district as chaotic 
and picturesque as Zummer was 
stark and dull; and here as well 
Vi;as the ancient University, over- 
looking the fish market along 
the banks of the Evres Canal. 

Ambeules lay across the ca- 
nal: a district of nine hills cov- 
ered with homes and a periphery 
given to wharves, warehouses, 
shipyards, mud-flats from which 
were dredged the famous Fla- 
mande Oysters. The great Gaas 
estuary separated Ambeules 
from Dourrai, a district of some- 
what lower hills again covered 
with small homes, with the great 
industries and fabrication plants 
straggling along the shore and 
southward. 

This was the city where Viole 
Falushe, or more accurately, 
Vogel Filschner, had lived and 
w’here he had committed his first 
great crime. The exact locale was 
Ambeules, and Gersen decided 
to base himself in this area. 

Finishing beer and sausages he 
rode an escalator to the third 
level above, where a local tube- 
car whisked him south under the 
Eves Canal to Ambeules Station. 
28 



He rode to the surface and, look- 
ing right and left through the 
hazy radiance which Character- 
ized the region, approached the 
old woman who managed a 
newsstand. “Which is a good ho- 
tel nearby?” 

The old woman pointed a 
brown finger. “Up Hoeblingasse 
to the Rembrandt Hotel. As good 
as any in Ambeules. Of course if 
its elegance you require, then 
you must go to the Hotel Prince 
Franz Ludwig, in Old Town, the 
finest in Europe with prices to 
match.” 

Gersen chose the Rembrandt 
Hotel, a pleasant old-fashioned 
structure with public rooms pan- 
eled in dark wood, and was tak- 
en to a suite of high-ceilinged 
rooms overlooking the great gray 
Gaas. 

''T~'he day was still young. Ger- 
sen rode a cab to the Mairic, 
where he paid a small fee atid 
was given access to the City Di- 
rectory. He ran the record back 
to 1495. The screen spun to the 
letter F, Fi, and finally to the 
name Filschner. At this time 
three Filschners were listed. Ger- 
sen made notes of the addresses. 
He likewise found two Tinzys 
and made similar notes. Then he 
dialed to the current li.stings 
and found two Filschners and 
four Tinzys. One of the Filsch- 
ners and one of the Tinzys had 

GALAXY 



maintained the same address 
across the years. 

Gersen next visited the office 
of the Ambeules Helton, and on 
the strength of his Cosmopolis 
card was given access to the 
morgue. He brought the index to 
the screen, scanned it for the 
name of Vogel Filschner, found 
a code number, coded and 
punched the Show button. 

The tale was much as Dupdine 
had told, though in condensed 
form. Vogel Filschner was des- 
cribed as “a boy given to spells 
of brooding and wandering alone 
by night.” His mother, Hedwig 
Filschner identified as a beauti- 
cian, professed herself amazed at 
Vogel’s outrageous deed. She 
described him as a “good boy, 
though very idealistic and 
moody.” 

Vogel Filschner had had no 
close friends. In the biology lab- 
oratory he had been teamed with 
a lad named Roman Haenigsen, 
the school chess champion. They 
had played an occasional game 
of chess during the lunch hour. 
Roman evinced no astonishment 
at Vogel’s crime: “He was a fel- 
low who hated to lose. Whenever 
I beat him, he would go savage 
and throw aside the pieces. Still, 
it amused me to play with him. I 
don’t like people who take the 
game frivolously.” 

Vogel Filschner was not a friv- 
olous boy, thought Gersen. 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



A photograph appeared : the 
kidnapped girls, grouped in a 
picture identified as the “Phili- 
dor Bohus Choral Society”. In 
the front row stood a plump 
smiling girl in whom Gersen rec- 
ognized Dundine. Among the 
girls would be Jheral Tinzy, and 
Gersen checked the face against 
the caption. Jheral Tinzy was 
the third girl in the fourth row. 
Not only did a girl in the third 
row obscure her face; she also 
had turned her head aside at 
the time the photograph was 
taken, and what could be seen 
of her face was indistinct. 

There was no photograph of 
Vogel Filschner. 

The file ended. 

So much for that, thought 
Gersen. Vogel Filschner’s identi- 
ty with Viole Falushe was not 
widely apprehended in Ambeu- 
les, if not at all. As verification, 
Gersen dialed for the file on Vi- 
ole Falushe, the Demon Prince, 
but only a single reference excit- 
ed his interest: “Viole Falushe at 
various times has implied that his 
original home was Earth. On sev- 
eral occasions a rumor has reach- 
ed us to the effect that Viole 
Falushe has been seen here in 
Ambeules. Why he should wish 
to haunt our unexciting district 
is a question which cannot be 
answered, and the rumors appear 
to be no more than an insane 
hoax.” 



29 



ersen departed from the 
newspaper offices and went 
to stand in the street. 

The gendarmerie? Gersen de- 
cided against approaching them. 
Unlikely that they could tell him 
more than he already knew. Un- 
likely that they would if they 
could. Additionally, Gersen had 
no desire to arouse official curi- 
osity. 

Gersen checked the addresses 
he had noted, as well as the lo- 
cation of the Philidor Bohus Ly- 
ceum, against his map. The Ly- 
ceum was the nearest, at the far 
side of Lothar Parish. Gersen sig- 
naled a three-wheeled auto-cab 
and was conveyed up one of the 
nine hills through a district of 
small detached houses. Some 
were constructed in the ancient 
fashion, of glazed dark red brick 
and a high pitched roof of milk 
glass tiles, others in the new “hol- 
low trunk” style : narrow concrete 
cylinders two thirds below the 
ground. There were houses of ar- 
tificial sandstone compressed as 
a unit from molded soil; houses 
of pink or white panels surmount- 
ed by crimped metal domes; 
houses of laminated paper, with 
transparent roofs electrically 
charged to repel dust. The bulbs 
of uni-cast glass or glass-metal 
so common among the worlds of 
the Concourse had never won ac- 
ceptance among the folk of west- 
ern Europe, who compared them 
30 



to pumpkins and paper lanterns 
and called the people who lived 
in them “non-human futurians”. 
The cab discharged Gersen be- 
fore the Philidor Bohus Lyceum, 
a grim cube of synthetic black 
stone flanked by a pair of small- 
er cubes. 

The director of the lyceum was 
Dr. Willem Ledinger, a bland 
large-bodied man with taffy-col- 
ored skin and a lank lock of yel- 
low hair which wound around his 
scalp in a most peculiar manner. 
Gersen wondered at the man’s 
audacity thus to present himself 
before several thousand adoles- 
cents. Ledinger was affable and 
unsuspicious, readily accepting 
Gersen’s statement that Cosmo- 
polis wished to present a survey 
of contemporary young people. 

“I don’t think there’s much to 
write about,” said Ledinger. “Our 
young people are, if I must say 
it, unexceptionable. We have 
many bright students and at 
least our fair quota of dullards.” 

Gersen steered the conversa- 
tion to students of the past and 
their careers; from here it was an 
easy connection to the subject 
of Vogel Filschner. 

“Ah, yes,” mused Dr. Leding- 
er, patting his yellow top-knot. 
“Vogel Filschner. I haven’t heard 
his name for years. Before my 
time, of course; I was a mere 
instructor across the city at Hul- 
ba Technical Academy. But the 

GALAXY 



scandal reached us, never fear! 
Faculties have big ears. What a 
tragedy! To think of a lad like 
that going so far wrong!” 

“He never returned to Am- 
beules, then?” 

“He’d be a fool to do so. Or to 
advertise his presence, at any 
rate.” 

“Do you have the likeness of 
Vogel Filschner among your rec- 
ords? Perhaps I might do a sep- 
arate piece upon this peculiar 
crime.” 

^^rudgingly Dr. ledinger ad- 
mitted that photographs of 
Vogel Filschner were on file. 
“But why rake up old nasti- 
ness? It is like breathing into 
graves.” 

“On the other hand, such an 
article might identify the rogue 
and bring him to justice.” 

“Justice?” Dr. Ledinger curled 
his lip in disbelief. “After thirty 
years? He was a hysterical child. 
No matter what his crime, by this 
time he has made redemption 
and found peace. What could be 
gained by bringing him to what 
you call ‘justice’?” 

Gersen was somewhat startled 
by Dr. Ledinger’s vehemence. 
“To dissuade others. Perhaps 
there is a potential Vogel Filsch- 
ner among your students this very 
instant.” 

Dr. Ledinger smiled wistfully. 
“I don’t doubt it an instant. Cer- 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



tain of these young rascals — 
well, I won’t tell tales out of 
school. And I won’t supply you 
with the photographs. I find the 
idea completely objectionable.” 
“Is there a yearbook for the 
year of the crime? Or better, the 
previous year?” 

Dr. Ledinger looked at Gersen 
a moment, his affability slowly 
disappearing. Then he went to his 
wall, plucked a volume from the 
shelves. He watched quietly as 
Gersen turned the pages and fi- 
nally came upon the photograph 
of the Girls’ Choral Society he 
had already seen. Gersen point- 
ed. “There is Jheral Tinzy, the 
girl who rebuffed Vogel and drove 
him to his crime.” 

Dr. Ledinger examined the pic- 
ture. “Think of it. Twenty-eight 
girls — snatched away Beyond. 
Their lives blasted. I wonder how 
they fared.” 

“Whatever became of Jheral 
Tinzy? She was not among the 
group, if you recall.” 

Dr. Ledinger examined Gersen 
with suspicion. “You seem to 
know a great deal about the case. 
Have you been completely can- 
did with me?” 

Gersen grinned. “Not altogeth- 
er. I am principally interested in 
Vogel Filschner, but I don’t want 
anyone to know I’m interested. 
If I can get the information I 
need discreetly, with no one the 
wiser, so much the better.” 



31 



“You are a police officer? Or 
of the IPCC?” 

Gersen displayed his identifi- 
cation. “Here is my sole claim 
to fame.” 

“Hmmf. Cosmopolis plans to 
publish an article on Vogel Fil- 
schner? It seems a waste of paper 
and ink. No wonder Cosmopolis 
has lost prestige.” 

“What of Jheral Tinzy? You 
have her photograph in your 
files?” 

“Undoubtedly.” Dr. Ledinger 
laid his hands upon the desk, to 
signal that the interview had 
reached its end. “But we cannot 
open our confidential files hap- 
hazardly. I am sorry.” 

Gersen rose to his feet “Thank 
you, in any case.” 

“I have done nothing to help 
you,” said Dr. Ledinger stonily. 

VI 

'ITogel Filschner had lived with 
^ his mother in a narrow little 
house at the eastern end of Am- 
beules, bordering on a dingy dis- 
trict of warehouses and transpor- 
tation depots. Gersen climbed 
the embroidered iron steps, touch- 
ed the button, faced the inspec- 
tion eye. A woman’s voice spoke. 
“Yes?” 

Gersen spoke in his most con- 
fident voice: “I am trying to lo- 
cate Madame Hedwig Filschner, 
who lived here many years ago.” 

32 



“I know no one of that name. 
You must consult with Ewane 
Clodig, who owns the property. 
We only pay rent. 

Ewane Clodig, whom Gersen 
found in the offices of Clodig 
Properties, consulted his records. 
“Madame Hedwig Filschner? The 
name is familiar, but I don’t see 
it on my list . Here it is. She 
moved, let me see, thirty years 
ago.” 

“You have her present ad- 
dress?” 

“No, sir. That is too much to 
ask. I have not even a forward- 
ing address from thirty years ago 
. But it comes back! Is .she 
not the mother of Vogel Filsch- 
ner, the boy slaver?” 

“Correct.” 

“Well then, I can tell you this. 
When the deed was known, she 
packed her belongings and dis- 
appeared, and no one has heard 
of her since.” 

J heral Tinzy’s old home was a 
tall octagonal structure of the 
so-called Fourth Palladian style, 
situated halfway up Bailleul Hill. 
The address corresponded to one 
which Gersen had noted in the 
current directory; the family had 
not changed its residence. 

A handsome woman of early 
middle age ansv.?ered the door. 
She wore a gay peasant smock, a 
flowered scarf around her head. 
Gersen appraised the woman bc- 

GALAXY 



fote he spoke. She returned a 
gaze so direct as to be bold. 
“You’re Jheral Tinzy?” Gersen 
asked tentatively. 

“Jheral?” The woman’s eye- 
brows arched high. “No. No, in- 
deed.” She gave a sardonic bark 
of laughter. “What a strange 
thing to ask. Who are you?” 
Gersen produced his identifi- 
cation. The woman read, return- 
ed the card. “What makes you 
think I am Jheral Tinzy?” 

“She lived here at one time. 
She would be about your age.” 
“I’m her cousin.” The woman 
considered Gersen more carefully 
than ever. “What did you want 
with Jheral?” 

“May I come in? I’ll explain.” 
The woman hesitated. As Ger- 
sen came forward she made a 
(|uick motion to restrain him. 
Then, after a dubious glance 
over her shoulder, she moved 
aside. 

Gersen entered a hall with a 
floor of immaculate white glass 
tiles. On one hand was the dis- 
play wall characteristic of mid- 
dle-class European homes. Here 
hung a panel intricately inlaid 
with wood, bone and shell — Len- 
ka workmanship from Nowhere, 
one of the Concourse planets, a 
set of perfume points from Pam- 
file; a rectangle of polished and 
perforated obsidian : — one of the 
so-called ‘supplication slabs’ from 
Lupus 2311; a small tapestry of 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



exquisite design and workman- 
ship. Gersen paused to examine 
it. “This is a beautiful piece. Do 
you know where it came from?” 
“It’s very rich,” agreed the 
woman. “I believe it came from 
off-world.” 

“It looks to me like a Sabra 
piece,” said Gersen. 

TTrora the upper floor came a 
'*■ harsh call: “Emma? who is 
there?” 

“Awake already,” muttered 
the woman. She raised her voice. 
“A gentleman from Cosmopolis, 
Aunt.” 

“We wish no magazines!” cried 
the voice. “I am explicit!” 

“Very well. Aunt. I’ll tell him 
so.” Emma signaled Gersen into 
a sitting room, jerked her head 
toward the source of the voice. 
“Jheral’s mother. She is not well.” 
“A pity,” said Gersen. “Where, 
incidentally, is Jheral?” 

Emma turned her bold glance 
on Gersen. “Why do you want 
to know?” 

“To be candid, I’m trying to 
locate one Vogel Filschner.” 
Emma laughed soundlessly 
and without mirth. “You’ve come 
to the wrong place to find Vogel 
Filschner. What a joke!” 

“You knew him?” 

“Oh yes. He was in the class 
under mine at the Lyceum.” 
“You haven’t seen him since 
the kidnapping?” 



33 



“Oh, no. Never. Still, it’s 
strange that you should ask. 
Emrna hesitated, smiling tremu- 
lously as if in embarrassment. 
“It’s like a cloud passing over 
the sun. Sometimes I look 
around, sure that I’ve glimpsed 
Vogel Filschner — but he’s never 
there.” 

“What happened to Jheral?” 

Emma seated herself, looked 
far back down the years. “You 
must remember that there was 
much publicity and outcry. It 
was the greatest outrage in mem- 
ory. Jheral became pointed at; 
there were unpleasant scenes. 
Several of the mothers actually 
slapped and abused Jheral; she 
had snubbed Vogel, driven him 
to crime, hence shared his guilt. 
I must admit,” said Emma re- 
flectively, “that Jheral was a 
heartless flirt. She was simply 
adorable, of course. She could 
bring the boys with one little 
side^look — like this.” Emma 
demonstrated. “Such a rascal. 
She even flirted with Vogel — 
pure sadism, because she 
couldn’t bear the sight of him. 
Ah, the detestable Vogel! Every 
day Jheral would come home 
from school to tell us another of 
Vogel’s enormities. How he dis- 
sected a frog and then, after 
wiping his hands on a paper 
towel, ate his lunch! How bad- 
ly he smelled, as if he never 
changed his clothes! How he 
34 



would boast of his poetic mind 
and try to impress her with his 
magnificence! It’s true. Jheral 
with her tricks incited Vogel — 
and twenty- eight other girls paid 
the price.” 

“And then?” 

“Great indignation. Everyone 
turned against Jheral, as per- 
haps they had always longed to 
do. Jheral finally ran away with 
an older man. She never returned 
to Ambeules. Not even her 
mother has the slightest idea of 
where she is.” 

Into the room rushed a blaz- 
ing-eyed old woman with a mane 
of flying white hair. Gersen 
jumped behind a chair to avoid 
her charge. “What do you do, 
asking questions in this house? 
Be off with you! Hasn’t there 
been trouble enough? I don’t 
trust your face, you are like all 
the rest! Out, never return! 
Scoundrel! The audacity, enter- 
ing this house with your filthy 
questions . .” 

Gersen left the house as ex- 
peditiously as he was able. Em- 
ma started to accompany him to 
the door; but her aunt, hobbling 
forward, shoved her aside to pre- 
vent her from going. 

The door closed; the near- 
hysterical ranting became muf- 
fled. Gersen heaved a deep 
breath. A virago! He had been 
lucky to escape without any 
scratches. 



GALAXY 



A t a nearby cafe Gersen drank 
a flask of wine and watched 
the sun sink toward the sfea. 

An excellent possibility, of 
course, that the entire line of in- 
vestigation, beginning with the 
notice in the Avente newspaper, 
was a wild-goose chase. To date, 
the only link between Viole Fal- 
ushe and Vogel Filschner was the 
opinion of Kakarsis Asm. Emma 
Tinzy apparently believed that 
she had seen Vogel Filschner in 
Ambeules; Viole Falushe might 
well enjoy the dangerous pleasure 
of returning to the scenes of his 
childhood. If so, why had he not 
revealed himself to his old ac- 
quaintances? Although it seemed 
that Vogel Filschner had made 
precious few friends or acquaint- 
ances in any event. Jheral Tinzy 
perhaps had made the wisest of 
decisions when she took herself 
away from Ambeules. Viole Fal- 
ushe had a notoriously long mem- 
ory. 

His one friend had been Roman 
Haenigsen, the chess champion. 
Somewhere also had been men- 
tion of a poet who had incited 
Vogel Filschner to excess . , 

Gersen called for a directory, 
and searched for the name 
Haenigsen. There it was; the 
book almost fell open to the 
name. Gersen copied the address 
and asked directions from a wait- 
er. It appeared that Roman 
Haenigsen lived hardly five min- 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



utes’ walk away. Finishing his 
wine, Gersen set off through the 
waning sunlight. 

The house of Roman Haen- 
igsen was the most elegant of 
the houses he had visited this 
day: a three-story structure of 
metal and melt-stone panels, 
with electric windows to go 
transparent or opaque at a 
spoken word. 

Haenigsen was only just ar- 
riving home when Gersen turned 
into the walkway: a small brisk 
man with a large head and prim 
meticulous features. He peered 
sharply at Gersen and asked his 
business. Candor in this case 
seemed more useful than indirec- 
tion. Gersen said: 

“I am making inquiries in re- 
gard to your old classmate Vogel 
Filschner. I understand that you 
were almost his only friend.” 
“Hm,” said Roman Haenig- 
sen. He thought a moment. 
“Come inside, if you will, and we 
will talk.” 

He took Gersen into a study 
decorated with all manner of 
chess memorabilia : portraits, 

busts, collections of chessmen, 
photographs. “Do you play 
chess?” he asked Gersen. 

“I have played on occasion, 
though not often.” 

“Like anything else, one must 
practice to keep in fighting trim. 
Chess is an old game.” He went 
to a board, disarranged the chess- 

35 



men with affectionate contempt. 
“Every variation has been ana- 
lyzed; there is a recorded game 
to illuminate the results of any 
reasonable move. If one had a 
sufficiently good memory he 
would not need to think to win 
his games; he could merely play 
someone else’s winning game. 
Luckily, no one owns such a 
memory but the robots. Still, you 
did not come here to talk of 
chess. Will you take a glass of 
liquor?” 

“Thank you.” Gersen accept- 
ed a crystal goblet containing 
an ineh of spirits. 

“Vogel Filschner! Strange to 
hear that name once more! Is 
his whereabouts known?” 

“This is what I am attempting 
to learn.” 

O Oman Haenigsen gave his 
head a wry shake. “You will 
learn nothing from me. I have 
neither seen him nor heard from 
him since' 1494.” 

“I had hardly expected that 
he would return in his old iden- 
tity. But it’s possible — ” Ger- 
sen paused as Roman Haenigsen 
snapped his fingers. 

“Peculiar!” said Haenigsen. 
“Each Thursday night I play at 
the Chess Club. Perhaps a year 
ago I noticed a man standing 
under the clock. I thought, 
surely that’s not Vogel Filsch- 
ner? He turned, I saw his face. 
36 



It was a man somewhat like Vo- 
gel, but far different. A man of 
fine appearance and poise, a man 
who had nothing of Vogel’s 
hang-dog surliness. And yet, 
since you mention it, there was 
something to this man, perhaps 
his manner of holding his arms 
and hands, which reminded me 
of Vogel.” 

“You haven’t seen this man 
since?” 

“Not once.” 

“Did you speak to him?” 
“No. In my surprise I must 
have halted to stare, but then I 
hurried on past.” 

“Can you think of anyone 
Vogel might wish to see? Did 
he have friends other than 
yourself?” 

Roman Haenigsen pursed his 
lips wryly. “I was hardly his 
friend. We shared a laboratory 
table ; I played him an occa- 
sional game of chess, which he 
often won. Had he applied him- 
self he might have taken the 
championship. But he cared only 
for mooning over girls and writ- 
ing bad poetry in imitation of a 
certain Navarth.” 

“Ah. Navarth. This is the poet 
whom Vogel Filschner sought to 
emulate.” 

“Unfortunately. In my opinion 
Navarth was a charlatan, a 
bombast, a man of the most dub- 
ious attitudes.” 

“And what became of him?” 
GALAXY 



“I believe he still is about, 
though hardly the man he was 
thirty years ago. People have 
grown wise. Studied decadence 
no longer shocks as it did when 
I was a lad. Vogel naturally was 
entranced and went through the 
most ludicrous antics in order 
to identify with his idol. Yes, in- 
deed. If anyone is to blame for 
the crimes of Vogel Filschner it 
is the mad poet Navarth!” 

VII 

£ \n the following day Gersen 

’ i^aid a second visit to the 
offices of the Helion. The dos- 
sier on Navarth was enthusias- 
tic and ample, reporting scan- 
dals, improprieties, defiances and 
outrageous pronouncements 
across a period of forty years. 

The initial entry dealt with an 
opera presented by students of 
the university, with libretto by 
Navarth The first performance 
was declared an infamy, and 
nine stiuients were expelled from 
the university. Thereafter Na- 
varth’s career soared and col- 
lap.sed, resurged, recollapsed, at 
last with finality. For the past 
ten years he had resided aboard 
a houseboat on the Gaas estu- 
ary, near the Fitlingasse. 

Gersen tubed to Station Hed- 
rick on Boulevard Castel Vi- 
vence, surfaced into the com- 
mercial and shipping district of 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



Ambeules, beside the Gaas es- 
tuary. The district roiled with 
the activity of agencies, ware- 
houses, offices, wharves, buffets, 
restaurants, wine shops, fruit- 
hawkers, news kiosks, dispensa- 
ries. Barges nosed into docks to 
be unloaded by robots; drays 
rumbled along the boulevard ; 
from below came the vibration of 
freight moving by tube. At a 
sweet-shop Gersen inquired for 
the Fitlingasse and was directed 
east along the boulevard. 

Automatic open-sided pas- 
senger-wagons served the boule- 
vard, with patrons riding on 
benches facing the street. Gersen 
rode a mile, two miles, with the 
Gaas on the right hand. The 
bustle diminished: the imposing 
blocks and masses of the com- 
mercial district gave way to three- 
and four-story structures of vast 
age, queer narrow-windowed 
buildings of melt-stone or terra- 
cotta panels, stained a hundred 
subtle colors by smoke and salt 
air. Occasionally the wagon 
passed vacant areas, where only 
weeds grew. Through these gaps 
could be seen the next street to 
the north, on a somewhat higher 
level than Boulevard Castel Vi- 
vence, with tall apartment build- 
ings pressed tightly against each 
other. 

The Fitlingasse was a narrow 
gray alley striking off up the 
hill. Gersen alighted and almost 

37 



at once observed a hulking two- 
storied houseboat moored to a 
dilapidated dock. 

A wisp of smoke drifted up 
from the chimney. Someone was 
aboard. 

ersen took stock of the sur- 
roundings. Hazy sunlight 
played on the estuary; on the 
far shore thousands of houses 
with brown tile roofs stood in 
ranks down to the water’s edge. 
Elsewhere were unused wharves, 
rotting piles, a warehouse or two, 
a saloon with purple and green 
windows extending over the 
water. 

On the dock a girl of seven- 
teen or eighteen sat tossing peb- 
bles into the water. She gave 
Gersen a brief dispassionate 
stare, looked away. 

Gersen turned back to consider 
the houseboat. If this were Na- 
varth’s residence he enjoyed a 
very pleasant prospect — though 
the wan sunlight, the brown 
roofs of Dourrai, the rotting 
wharves, the lapping water in- 
vested the scene with melan- 
choly. Even the girl seemed som- 
ber beyond her years. She wore 
a short black skirt, a brown 
jacket. Her hair was dark and 
rumpled, whether from wind or 
neglect could not be known. Ger- 
sen approached and inquired, 
“Is Navarth aboard the house- 
boat?” 

38 



She nodded without change of 
expression and watched with 
the detachment of a naturalist 
as Gersen descended the ladder 
to the landing, then crossed an 
alarming gangplank to the fore- 
deck of the houseboat. 

Gersen knocked at the door. 
There was no response. Gersen 
knocked again. 

The door was flung violently 
open. A sleepy, unshaven man 
peered forth. His age was in- 
determinate; he was thin, spin- 
dle-shanked, with a twisted beak 
of a nose, rumpled hair of no 
particular color, eyes which 
though perfectly set gave the 
impression of looking in two 
directions at once. His manner 
wild and truculent. “Is there no 
privacy left in the world? Off the 
boat, at once! Whenever I settle 
for a moment’s rest, some sheep- 
faced functionary, some impor- 
tunate peddler of tracts insists 
on pounding me out of my couch. 
Will you not depart? Have I not 
made myself clear? I warn you, I 
have a trick or two up my 
sleeve!” 

Gersen tried to speak to no 
avail. When Navarth reached 
within he hastily retreated to the 
dock. “A moment of your time!” 
he called. “I am no functionary, 
no salesman. I am named Henry 
Lucas, and I wish — ” 

Navarth shook his skinny fist. 
“Not now, not tomorrow, not in 

GALAXY 



the total scope of the future, nor 
at any time thereafter do I wish 
to make your acquaintance. Be 
off with you! You have the face 
of a man that brings ill news; a 
gnasliing blacktooth grin. These 
matters are clear to me; you are 
fey! I want nothing of you. Go 
away.” With a leer of evil 
triumph he swung the gangplank 
away from the landing, re-entered 
the houseboat. 

Gcrsen returned to the dock. 
The girl sat as before. Gersen 
looked back down at the house- 
boat. He asked in a wondering 
voice: “Is he always like that?” 

“He is Navarth,” said the girl, 
as if this were all that need be 
said. 

crsen went to the sal oon and 
drank a pint of beer. The 
bartender was a quiet watchful 
man of great height with an im- 
posing stomach, and either knew, 
nothing aljout Navarth or did not 
choose to reveal what he knew. 
Gersen gleaned no information. 

He sat thinking. A half hour 
passed. Then going to the tele- 
phone directory, he looked in 
the classified section under ‘Sal- 
vage’. An advertisement caught 
his eye: 

Joban Salvage and Tow 
Tugs — Crane Barge — 
Diving Equipment 

No job too large or too small 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



Gersen telephoned and made 
his needs known. He was assured 
that on the morrow the equip- 
ment he required would be at 
his service. 

The following morning a hea- 
vy ocean-going tug drove up the 
estuary, turned, eased into the 
mooring next to Navarth’s house- 
boat, with a bare three feet be- 
tween. The mate bawled orders 
to the seamen; lines were flung 
up to the dock and dropped over 
bollards. The tug was securely 
moored. 

Navarth came out on the deck, 
dancing with fury. “Must you 
loom so close? Take that great 
hulk away! Do you intend to 
thrust me into the dock?” 
Leaning on the railing of the 
tug. Gersen looked into No- 
varth’s upturned face. “I be- 
lieve I spoke a few words to 
you yesterday?” 

“I recall very well. I re- 
quested your departure, and here 
you are again, more inconven- 
iently than before.” 

“I wonder if you would give 
me the pleasure of a few min- 
utes conversation? Perhaps there 
might be profit in it for you.” 
“Profit? Bah! I have poured 
more money out of my shoe than 
you have spent. I require only 
that you take your tug else- 
where.” 

“Certainly. We are here but 
for a few minutes.” 



39 



Navarth gave a pettish nod. At 
the far side of the tug the diver 
Gersen had hired was climbing 
back aboard. Gersen turned to 
Navarth. “It’s very important 
that I speak to you. If you would 
be so good as to — ” 

“This ‘importance’ exists from 
a single point of view. Be off 
with you and your mammoth 
tug!” 

“At once,” said Gersen. He 
nodded to the diver, who touched 
a button. 

Under the houseboat sounded 
an explosion ; the houseboat 
shuddered, began to list. 

Navarth ran back and forth 
in a frenzy. From the tug grap- 
ples were lowered and hooked to 
the houseboat’s rub-rail. “Ap- 
parently there has been an ex- 
plosion in your engine room,” 
Gersen told Navarth. 

“How can this be? There has 
never been an explosion before! 
There is not even an engine. I 
am about to sink!” 

“Not so long as you are sup- 
ported by the lines. But we are 
leaving in one minute, and I 
must cut loose the grapples.” 

“What?” Navarth threw up 
his arms. “I will go to the bottom, 
together with the boat! Is this 
your desire?” 

“If you recall, you yourself 
ordered me to leave,” said Ger- 
sen in a reasonable voice. 
“Hence — ” he turned to the 

40 



crewmen — “throw off the 
grapples! We depart!” 

“No, no!” bellowed Navarth. 
“I’ll sink!” 

“If you invite me aboard 
your boat, if you talk to me and 
help me compose an article I’m 
writing, then that’s a different 
matter,” said Gersen. “I might 
be disposed to help you through 
this misfortune — even, per- 
haps, to the extent of repairing 
your hull.” 

“Why not?” stormed Navarth. 
“You are responsible for the ex- 
plosion!” 

“Careful, Navarth! That’s at 
the very verge of slander! Re- 
member there are witnesses!” 
“Bah! What you have done is 
piracy and extortion. Writing an 
article, indeed! Well, then — why 
didn’t you say so in the first 
place? I too am a writer! Come 
aboard; we will talk. I am al- 
ways grateful for some small di- 
• version; a man without friends 
is a tree without leaves.” 

Gersen jurnped down upon the 
houseboat; Navarth, now all 
amiability, arranged chairs where 
they caught the full play of the 
pallid sunlight. He brought forth 
a bottle of white wine. “Sit then; 
make yourself at ease!” He open- 
ed the bottle, poured, then lean- 
ing back in his chair drank with 
pleasure. His face was placid and 
guileless, as if all the racial wis- 
dom had passed through leav- 

GALAXY 



ing no perceptible traces. Like 
Earth, Navarth was old, irre- 
sponsible and melancholy, full of 
a dangerous mirth. 

“You are a writer then? I may 
say you do not correspond to 
the usual image.” 

ersen produced his Cosmo- 
polls identification. “Mr. 
Henry Lucas,” read Navarth. 
“Special writer. Why do you 
come to me? I am no longer 
heeded, my vogue is a memory. 
Discredited, penurious. Where 
was my offense? I sought to ex- 
press truth in all its vehemence. 
This is a danger! A meaning 
must be uttered idly, without 
emphasis. The listener is under 
no compulsion to react, his cus- 
tomary defenses are not in place, 
the Meaning enters his mind. I 
have much to say about the 
world, but every year the com- 
pulsion dwindles. Let them live 
and die: it is all one to me. 
What will you write about?” 
“Viole Falushe.” 

Navarth blinked. “An inter- 
esting topic, but why come to 
me?” 

“Because you knew him as 
Vogel Filschner.” 

“Hm. Well, yes. This is a fact 
not generally known.” With fin- 
gers suddenly limp. Navarth 
poured more wine. “What speci- 
fically do you wish?” 
“Knowledge.” 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



“I sugggest,” said Navarth, 
suddenly brisk, “that you seek 
the information at its source.” 
Gersen nodded agreement. 
“Well enough, if I knew where 
to look. But what if he is off 
Beyond, at his Palace of Love?” 
“This is not the case. He is 
here on Earth.” As soon as Na- 
varth spoke he seemed to re- 
gret his ingenuousness and 
frowned in irritation. 

Gersen leaned back, his doubts 
and misgivings dissolved. Vogel 
Filschner and Viole Falushe were 
one; here was a man who knew 
him in both identities. 

Navarth had become uneasy 
and resentful. “A thousand top- 
ics more interesting than Viole 
Falushe.” 

“How do you know he’s on 
Earth?” 

Navarth made a sound of 
grand scorn. “How do I know 
anything? I am Navarth!” He 
pointed to a wisp of smoke on 
the sky. “I see that, I know.” 
Fie pointed to a dead fish, float- 
ing belly upward. “I see that, I 
know.” He raised the bottle of 
wine, held it up against the sun- 
light. “I see that, I know.” 
Gersen reflected a moment in 
silence. “I am in no position to 
criticize your epistemology,” he 
said at last. “In the first place, 
I don’t understand it. Have you 
no more explicit knowledge of 
Viole Falushe?” 



41 



Navarth attempted to lay his 
finger slyly alongside his nose, 
but miscalculating, prodded his 
eye. “There is a time for bravado 
and another for caution. I still 
do not know the point of your 
article.” 

“It is to be a judicious docu- 
ment, without exaggeration or 
apology. I intend that the facts 
shall speak for themselves.” 

XTavarth pursed his lips. “A 

~ dangerous undertaking. 
Viole Falushe is the most sensi- 
tive of men. Do you recall the 
princess who detected a pea un- 
der forty mattresses? Viole Fal- 
ushe can smell out a slur in a 
blind infant’s morning invocation 
to Kalzibah. On the other hand, 
the world revolves; the carpet of 
knowledge unrolls. Viole Falushe 
has given me no cause for grati- 
tude.” 

“Your appraisal of his charac- 
ter then is negative?” asked Ger- 
sen cautiously. 

Navarth could control himself 
no longer. He drank wine with 
a grandoise gesture. “Negative 
indeed. Were I to give all or- 
ders, what a retribution I would 
create!” He slumped back in his 
chair, pointed a skinny finger 
toward the horizon, spoke in a 
hushed monotone; “A pyre tall 
as a mountain, and Viole Falushe 
at the top! Platforms surround- 
ing for ten thousand musicians. 
42 



With a single glance I strike the 
fire. The musicians play while 
their whiskey boils and their in- 
struments melt. Viole Falushe 
sings soprano . .” He poured 
more wine. “A wistful vision. It 
can never be. I would be con- 
tent seeing Viole Falushe drown- 
ed or dismembered by lions.” 

“You evidently are well ac- 
quainted.” 

Navarth nodded, his gaze fixed 
on the past. “Vogel Filschner 
read my poetry. An imaginative 
youth, but disoriented. How he 
changed, how he expanded! To 
his imagination he added con- 
trol; he is now a great artist.” 

“Artist? What manner of art- 
ist?” 

Navarth dismissed the question 
as irrelevant. “Never could he 
have arrived at his present sta- 
ture without art, without style 
and proportion! Do not be de- 
ceived! Like myself he is a sim- 
ple man, with the clearest of 
goals. Now you — you are the 
most complicated and opaque of 
men. I see a corner of your mind, 
then a black film shifts. Are you 
an Earthman? . But tell me 
nothing.” Navarth waved his 
hands as if to intercept any an- 
swer Gersen might feel called 
upon to make. “There is too 
much knowledge already in the 
world; we use facts as crutches, 
to the impoverishment of our 
senses. Facts are falsehoods, logic 

GALAXY 



is deceit. I know a single sj^stem 
of communication: the declaim- 
ing of poetry.” 

“Viole Falushe is also a poet?” 
“He has no great art with 
words,” grumbled Navarth, un- 
willing to relinquish control of 
the conversation. 

“When Viole Falushe visits 
Earth, where does he stay? Here 
with you?” 

Navarth stared at Gersen un- 
believingly. “This is a sorry 
thought.” 

“Where then does he stay?” 
“Here, there, everywhere. He 
is as elusive as air.” 

“How do you seek him out?” 
“That I never do. He occa- 
sionally visits me.” 

“And has he done so recent- 
ly?” 

“Yes, yes, yes. Have I not im- 
plied as much? Why are you so 
interested in Viole Falushe?” 
“To answer this would be to 
inflict a fact upon you,” said 
Gersen with a grin. “But it’s no 
secret. I represent Cosmopolis 
magazine and I wish to write an 
article on his life and activi- 
ties.” 

“Hmmf. A popinjay for vanity 
is Viole Falushe. But why not 
ask him directly?” 

“1 would like to do so. First I 
must make his acquaintance.” 
“Nothing is easier,” declared 
Navarth, “provided you pay the 
fees.” 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



“Why not? I am on a liberal 
expense account.” 

"VTavarth jumped to his feet, 
^ suddenly full of enthusiasm. 
“We will need a beautiful girl, 
young, unsullied. She must pro- 
ject a particular quality of scin- 
tillance, a susceptibility, a fervor, 
an urgency.” He looked vaguely 
here and there, as if in search of 
something he had lost. Up on 
the dock he spied the girl whom 
Gersen had seen the day before. 
Navarth put fingers to his mouth, 
produced a shrill whistle, sig- 
naled the girl to approach. 
“She’ll do very v/ell.” 

“Is this an unsullied young 
scintillant?” asked Gersen. “She 
seems more of a guttersnipe.” 
“Ha ha!” cawed Navarth. 
“You will see! I am weak and 
cachectic, but I am Navarth; old 
as I am women bloom under my 
touch. You shall see.” 

The girl came aboard the 
houseboat and listened to Na- 
varth’s program without com- 
ment. “We go forth to dine. Ex- 
pense means nothing, we shall 
exalt ourselves with the finest. 
Prepare yourself then with silks, 
with jewels, with your most pre- 
cious unguents. This is a wealthy 
gentleman, the finest of fellows. 
What is your name once more?” 
“Henry Lucas.” 

“Henry Lucas. He is impatient. 
Go then, prepare yourself.” 



43 



The girl shrugged. “I am pre- 
pared.” 

“You are the best judge of 
this,” declared Navarth. “Inside 
then, while I consult my ward- 
robe.” He glanced at the sky. 
“A yellow day, a yellow night. I 
will wear yellow.” 

He led the way into his saloon, 
which was furnished with a 
wooden table, two chairs of carv- 
ed oak, shelves stuffed with 
books and oddments, a vase con- 
taining several stalks of pam- 
pas grass. Navarth reached into 
a cabinet for a second flagon of 
wine, which he opened and bang- 
ed upon the table, along with 
glasses. “Drink.” With this he 
disappeared into the next room. 



Gersen and the girl were left 
alone. He examined her covert- 
ly. She wore the black skirt of 
yesterday, w'ith a black short- 
sleeved blouse, sandals, no jew- 
elry or skin-tone, which on Earth 
was not currently fashionable. 
The girl had good features, 
though her hair was a tangle. 
She was either extremely poised 
or vastly indifferent. On impulse 
Gersen took a comb from Na- 
varth’s wash-stand and. going to 
the girl, combed her hair. After 
a single startled glance she stood 
quiet and passive. Gersen won- 
dered what went on in her mind. 
Was she as mad as Navarth? 

“There,” he said at last. “You 
look somewhat better!” 




GALAXY 



Navarth returned, wearing a 
maroon jacket several sizes too 
large, a pair of yellow shoes. 
“You have not tasted the wine.” 
He filled three glasses brimming. 
“A merry evening in prospect! 
Here, the three of us; three is- 
lands in the sea, on each island a 
castaway soul: we go forth to- 
gether, and what shall we find?” 

Gersen tasted the wine: a fine 
heady moscato; he drank. Na- 
varth poured the wine down his 
throat as if he were emptying a 
bucket into the estuary. The girl 
drank, without a tremor, with- 
out display of emotion. A strange 
girl — thought Gersen. Somewhere 
behind the grave face was flam- 
boyance. What stimulus could 
bring it forth? What would cause 
her to laugh? 

“Are we ready then?” Navarth 
looked inquiringly from the girl 
to Gersen, then threw open the 
door and ushered them gracious- 
ly forth. “In search of Viole Falu- 
she!”

'"T~'he Hotel Prince Franz Lud- 
wig was the most elegant 
rendezvous of Rolingshaven. The 
main foyer was enormous: it 

measured two hundred feet on 
a side, a hundred feet to the 
ceiling. Golden light exuded from 
twelve chandeliers; a deep gold- 
en-brown carpet enriched with 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



subtle patterns covered the floor. 
The walls were covered with silk 
of pale blue and yellow; the 
ceiling depicted scenes from a 
medieval court. The furnishings 
were of an intricate antique 
style, solid yet graceful, with 
cushions of rose or yellow satin, 
the woodwork lacquered a muted 
gold. On marble tables stood 
eight-foot urns from which a pro- 
fusion of flower overflowed; be- 
side each table stood a smartly 
uniformed page boy. Here was 
a sumptuous intricacy which 
could be found nowhere but on 
old Earth. Never before had Ger- 
sen entered a place so grand. 

Navarth selected a couch near 
an alcove where a quartet of 
musicians played a set of capric- 
cios. Navarth summoned a page 
and ordered champagne. 

“Is this where we seek Viole 
Falushe?” asked Gersen. 

“I have seen him here on sev- 
eral occasions,” said Narvarth. 
“We shall be on the alert.” 

Sitting in the murmurous gold- 
en room they drank champagne. 
The girl’s black skirt and blouse, 
her bare brown legs and sandals, 
through paradox or improbable 
juxtaposition, seemed neither 
tawdry nor unsuitable. Gersen 
was puzzled. How had she man- 
aged the transformation? 

Navarth spoke of this and 
that; the girl said little, or noth- 
ing; Gersen was content to let 

45 



events go at their own pace. In- 
deed, he found himself enjoying 
the outing. The girl had put 
down considerable wine, but 
showed no effects. She seemed 
interested in the people who 
moved through the great foyer, 
but in a spirit of detachment. At 
last Gersen asked, “What is your 
name? I don’t know how to speak 
to you.” 

''T^he girl did not respond im- 
mediately. Navarth said, 
“Call her what you like. This is 
my custom. Tonight she is Zan 
Zu from Eridu.” 

The girl smiled, a brief flicker 
of amusement. Gersen decided 
that she was not, after all, a lack- 
wit. 

“Zan Zu, eh? Is this your 
name?” 

“It’s as good as any other.” 

“The champagne is finished, 
an excellent vintage. We go to 
dine!” Navarth rose to his feet 
and gave his arm to the girl. 
Crossing the foyer, they descend- 
ed four broad stairs into the 
dining room, which . was no less 
magnificent than the foyer. 

Navarth ordered dinner with 
enthusiasm and finesse. Never 
had Gersen enjoyed a finer meal 
— one which made him regret 
the limits imposed by the capa- 
city of his stomach. Navarth ate 
with voracious enjoyment. Zan 
Zu of Eridu, as Gersen now 
46 



thought of the girl, ate delicate- 
ly, without interest. 

Gersen watched her sidelong. 
Was she ill? Had she recently 
undergone some great sorrow, or 
shock? She seemed composed 
enough — too composed, con- 
sidering the wine she had drunk: 
moscato, champagne, the various 
wines Navarth had ordered to 
accompany dinner. Well, it made 
no difference to him, Gersen re- 
flected. His business was with 
Viole Falushe. Though here at 
the Hotel Prince Franz Ludwig, 
in the company of Navarth and 
Zan Zu, Viole Falushe seemed 
unreal. 

With an effort Gersen brought 
himself back to the business at 
hand. How easy to be seduced 
by richness, elegance, exquisite 
food, the golden light of chan- 
deliers! He asked, “If Viole Fal- 
ushe is not to be found here, 
where do you propose to look?” 
“I have no set scheme,” Na- 
varth explained. “We must move 
as the mood takes us. Do not 
forget that Viole Falushe long 
ago regarded me as an exemplar. 
Is it not reasonable to suppose 
that his program will merge with 
our own?” 

“Reasonable indeed.” 

“We will test the theory.” 
They lingered over coffee, tri- 
fles of fragrant pastry, quarter- 
gills of krystallek. Then Gersen 
paid the dinner check, well over 

GALAXY 



SVU 200. and they departed the 
Hotel Prince Franz Ludwig. 

“Now where?” asked Gersen. 

Navarth ruminated. “We are 
somewhat early. Still, at Mik- 
mak’s Cabaret there is always 
arnusement of one kind or an- 
other, if only in watching the 
good burghers at their decorous 
case.” 

T^rom Mikmak’s Cabaret, they 
^ moved to Paru’s, on to Der 
Fliegende Hollander, thence to 
the Blue Pearl. Each new tavern 
and cabaret seemed somewhat 
less genteel than the previous. 

From the Blue Pearl Navarth 
led the way to the Sunset Cafe 
on the Boulevard Castel Vivence 
in Ambeules, thereafter to a suc- 
cession of waterfront dives, beer 
cellars and dance-halls. At Za- 
diel’s All-World Rendezvous, 
Gersen interrupted one of Na- 
varth ’s dissertations. “Is if here 
that we can expect Viole Falu- 
she?” 

“Where else but here?” de- 
manded the mad poet, now 
somewhat drunk. “Where the 
heart of Earth beats the thickest 
blood! Thick, purple, smelling 
of must: like crocodile blood, 
the blood of dead lions. Never 
fear! You will see your man! 
. What was I discussing? My 
youth, my squandered youth! At 
one time I worked for Tellur 
Transit, investigating the con- 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



tents of lost suitcases. Here, per- 
haps, I gained my deepest in- 
sight into the structure of the 
human soul.” 

Gersen. sat back in his chair. 
In the present circumstances 
passive weariness was the opti- 
mum course. To his surprise he 
found himself slightly drunk, 
though he had attempted mod- 
eration. The colored lights, the 
musics, Navarth’s wild talk were 
probably no less responsible than 
the alcohol. 

Zan Zu was as remote as ever. 
Looking sidelong at her, as he 
had tended to do all evening, 
Gersen wondered: what goes on 
in this umbral creature’s mind? 
What does she hope from life? 
Does she daydream, does she 
yearn for a handsome lover, does 
she ache to travel, to visit the 
outworlds? 

From the ancient cathedral on 
Flamande Heights twelve rever- 
berating strokes of the bass bell. 
“The hour is midnight,” croaked 
Navarth. He rose swaying to his 
feet, looked from Gersen to the 
girl. “Now we proceed.” 

“Where now?” asked Gersen. 

Navarth pointed across the 
street, to a long low pavilion with 
an eccentric roof and festoons 
of green lights. “I suggest the 
Celestial Harmony Cafe, the ren- 
dezvous of travelers, spacemen, 
offworld wanderers, wayward 
vagabonds such as ourselves.” 

47 



the Celestial Harmony 
' Cafe they walked, Navarth 
declaiming upon the poor quali- 
ty of life in present day Roling- 
shaven. “We are stagnant, slow- 
ly decaying! Where is our vitali- 
ty? Drained to the outworlds! 
We have bled our life away! On 
Earth remain the -sickly, the de- 
praved, the cryptic thinkers, the 
sunset wanderers on the mud- 
flats, the paranoids and involutes, 
the great epicures, the timid 
dreamers, the medievalists!” 
“You have traveled the Oiku- 
mene?” Gersen inquired. 

“Never has my foot lost con- 
tact with the soil of Earth!” 

“In which of the categories, 
then, are you included?” 

Navarth waved his arms on 
high. “Have I not inveighed 
against categories? Here is the 
Celestial Harmony Cafe. We ar- 
rive at the peak of the evening!” 
They entered, threaded their 
way to a table, and Navarth in- 
stantly ordered magnum of 
champagne. The cafe was crowd- 
ed; voices, clatter, and shuffle 
competed with boisterous jigs 
played by an orchestra of fife, 
concertina, euphonium and ban- 
jo, while the clientele danced, 
cavorted, kicked and pranced 
after the modes familiar to them. 

A long bar on a level some- 
what higher than the main floor 
ran the width of the building. 
Men standing at the railing were 
48 



silhouetted against the orange 
and green lights of the bar. At 
the tables of the main floor sat 
men and women of every age, 
race, social condition and degree 
of sobriety. Most wore European 
garments, but not a few dis- 
played the costumes of other re- 
gions and other worlds. Hostess- 
es formal and self-appointed 
roved here and there, soliciting 
drinks, dispensing ribald repar- 
tee, arranging assignations. The 
musicians presently took up other 
instruments: a baritone lute, 

viola, flute and tymponet, with 
which they accompanied a troupe 
of tumblers. Navarth drank 
champagne with indefatigable 
zest. 

Zan Zu from Eridu looked this 
way and that, whether from in- 
terest, uneasiness or a sense of 
suffocation Gersen could not be 
sure. Her knuckles were white 
where she held the goblet. She 
turned her head suddenly, met 
his gaze; her lips quivered in 
the faintest possible ghost of a 
smile. Or an embarrassed grim- 
ace . She raised the goblet, 
sipped her champagne. 

Navarth’s gaiety was at its 
height. He sang to the music, 
tapped the table with his fingers, 
reached to embrace the hostess- 
es, who sidestepped with an air 
of boredom. 

As if struck by a new thought 
he turned to consider Zan Zu, 

GALAXY 



then inspected Gersen, as if puz- 
zled why Gersen were not more 
enterprising. Gersen could not 
resist another glance at Zan Zu, 
and whether through wine, the 
colored lights, the ambiance of 
the evening, the guttersnipe toss- 
ing pebbles from a dock was 
gone. Gersen stared at her. The 
transformation was astonishing. 
She was magic, a creature of en- 
trancing intensity. 

XT avarth was watching, gaiety 

^ suddenly abandoned. Ger- 
sen turned, Navarth looked 
quickly away. What am I up 
to? Gersen wondered. What is 
Navarth up to? 

Reluctantly Gersen rejected 
the concepts which had surged 
up into his mind. He settled back 
into his chair. 

Zan Zu, the girl from Eridu, 
looked somberly down at her 
goblet. With relief? Sadness? 
Boredom? Gersen was at a loss 
to decide. The ways of the girl’s 
mind seemed important indeed. 
What was he getting into, he 
asked himself with a pang of 
bitter anger. He glared at Na- 
varth, who met his gaze bland- 
ly. Zan Zu sipped her cham- 
pagne. 

Navarth intoned: “The Vine of 
Life grows a single melon. The 
color of the heart is unknown 
until the rind is split.” 

Gersen looked out across the 
THE PALACE OF LOVE 



tables. Navarth filled his gob- 
let; Gersen drank. 

Navarth was right. For a gain 
so wild, so delicious, so magic, 
there must be an initial abandon, 
a burning of bridges. What of 
Viole Falushe? What of his basic 
momentum? And as if in re- 
sponse to the thought Navarth 
seized his arm. “He has just 
come in.” 

Gersen roused himself from 
his brooding. “Where?” 

“There. At the bar.” 

Gersen scanned the line of 
men who stood along the rail- 
ing. Their silhouettes were near- 
ly identical. Some looked this 
way, some that; some held mugs 
or flasks; others leaned with el- 
bows on the railing. “Which is 
Viole Falushe?” 

“See the man who watches the 
girl? He can see no one else. He 
is fascinated.” 

Gersen searched along the line 
of men. None seemed to be pay- 
ing any great attention. Navarth 
whispered in a husky voice : “She 
knows! She is even more aware 
than I!” 

Gersen glanced at the girl, who 
seemed uneasy; her fingers fum- 
bled with the stem of the gob- 
let. 

As he watched, she glanced 
across the room at one of the 
dark shapes. How she had divin- 
ed the attention was beyond Ger- 
sen’s comprehension. 



49 



A waiter approached the girl, 
spoke into her ear: Gersen 
could not hear what was said. 
Zan Zu looked down at the 
champagne goblet, twisted the 
stem between her fingers. 

She came to some decision 
and putting her hands on the 
table rose to her feet. Gersen 
felt a surge of passion. Ignoble 
to sit quietly, to allow this to 
happen! He had been affronted. 
He was being pillaged of some- 
thing which, while it had never 
belonged to him, nevertheless 
was his own. With a spasm of 
terror he wondered if it were too 
late. He lurched forward. He put 
his arm around the girl’s waist, 
drew her down upon his lap. 

She turned him an astounded 
glance, like one suddenly wak- 
ing from sleep. “Why did you 
do that.^’’ 

“I don’t want you to go.” 

“Why not?” 

Gersen could not bring him- 
self to speak. Zan Zu sat passive- 
ly, if somewhat primly. Gersen 
noticed that there were tears in 
her eyes, that her cheeks were 
wet. Gersen kissed her cheek; 
Navarth gave vent to a mad 
cacchinnation. “Never, never 
does it end!” 

Gersen put Zan Zu back on 
her chair, but held his hand over 
hers. “What never will end?” he 
asked in an even voice. 

“I too have loved. But what 
50 



of that? The time for love is 
past. Now there will be trouble, 
of course. Do you not under- 
stand the sensitivity of Viole 
Falushe? He is as strange and 
delicate as a fern frond. He can- 
not bear deprivation; it sets his 
teeth on edge and makes him 
ill.” 

“This did not occur to me.” 

“You have acted altogether 
wrongly,” scolded Navarth. “His 
thoughts were totally for the 
girl. You need only have fol- 
lowed her, and there would have 
been Viole Falushe.” 

“Yes,” muttered Gersen. “True. 
True. I now understand that.” 
He glowered at the wine gob- 
let, then back at the line of sil- 
houettes. Someone was watch- 
ing; he could sense the atten- 
tion. There was trouble on the 
way. He was not in optimum 
condition, he had not trained in 
weeks. Additionally he was half- 
drunk. 

A man walking past seemed 
to slip. He reeled into the table, 
upset wine into Gersen’s lap. He 
looked into Gersen’s face with 
eyes the color of bone. “Did you 
trip me, you sneak? I’ve a mind 
to spank you like a child.” 

Gersen studied the man. He 
had a slab-sided face, close- 
cropped yellow hair, a short neck 
as wide as his head. His body 
was stocky and muscular, the 
body of a man who spent much 

GALAXY 



of his life on one of the heavy 
planets. “I don’t believe I trip- 
ped you,” said Gersen. But sit 
down. Join us for a glass of wine. 
Ask your friend to join us, as 
well.” 

The white-eyed man paused 
to consider a moment. He came 
to a decision. “I demand an 
apology!” 



C t^ertainly,” said Gersen. “It 
was on the tip of my 
tongue. If in any way I am re- 
sponsible for causing you incon- 
venience, I am sorry.” 

“This is not enough! I despise 
foul baboons like yourself who 
insult one, then think to smirk 
themselves free of the conse- 
quences.” 



“This is your privilege,” said 
Gersen. “Despise whom you like. 
But why not bring your friend 
over to join us? We could find 
much to talk about. You are 
from which world?” He raised 
his glass to drink. 

The white-eyed man struck 
down the glass. “I insist that you 
leave the premises. You have 
offended me sufficiently.” 

Gersen looked across the 
white-eyed man’s shoulder. 
“Your friend comes, in spite of 
your asinine braying.” 

The white-eyed man turned to 
look; Gersen kicked at his knee, 
hacked at the bulwark of a neck. 
Seizing one of the man’s arms. 



THE PALACE OF LOVE 



Gersen heaved and sent him spin- 
ning across the dance floor. The 
w'hite-eyed man bounced erect 
without effort and came back in 
a running crouch. Gersen pushed 
a chair into his face; the white- 
eyed man swept it aside, while 
Gersen struck him in the stom- 
ach. This was ribbed with mus- 
cle and hard as oak. The white- 
eyed man hunched his shoullers, 
jumped for Gersen, but four 
bouncers had appeared. Two 
propelled Gersen to the rear 
entrance and ejected him; two 
more escorted the white-eyed 
man to the front entrance. 

Gersen stood disconsolately in 
the street. The entire evening 
was a botchery. What had got 
into him? 

The white-eyed man might 
well be circling the building to 
find him. Gersen stepped back 
into the shadows. After a mo- 
ment he started cautiously 
around to the front. At the 
corner waited the white-eyed 
man. “Dog’s meat. You kicked 
me, you struck me. It is my 
turn.” 

“Best that you go your way,” 
said Gersen in a mild voice. “I 
am a dangerous man.” 

“What do you think of me?” 
The white-eyed man approach- 
ed; Gersen backed away, in no 
mood for rough-housing. He car- 
ried weapons, but on Earth kill- 
ing was not taken lightly. 



51 



The white-eyed man sidled 
forward. Gersen’s heel came in 
contact with a bucket. He pick- 
ed it up, slung it into the white- 
eyed man’s face and was quickly 
around the corner. The white- 
eyed man came after him. Ger- 
sen held out his hand to dis- 
play his proiac. “See this? I can 
kill you.” 

The white-eyed man stood 
back, teeth glinting in a show 
of absolute contempt. 

ersen went to the front of 
the Celestial Harmony Cafe, 
the white-eyed man following at 
a distance of thirty feet. 

The table was vacant. Navarth 
and Zan Zu were gone. The 
lounging figure at the railing? 
Lost among the others. 

The white-eyed man waited 
beside the building. Gersen re- 
flected a moment. Then slow- 
ly, as if in a reverie, he moved 
off down the boulevard and 
turned into a dark side street. 

He waited. A minute passed. 
Gersen slid twenty feet farther 
along to a more favorable posi- 
tion, all the time watching the 
gap where street met boulevard. 



But no one passed in front, no 
one came to investigate. 

Gersen waited ten minutes, 
watching both ways, presently 
craning his neck to peer up, on 
the chance that his enemy was 
coming over the roofs. 

At last he returned to the 
boulevard. The botchery was 
complete. The white-eyed man, 
the most immediate link with 
Viole Falushe, had not bothered 
to pursue Gersen’s acquaintance. 

Seething with frustration, Ger- 
sen rode out Boulevard Castel 
Vivence to the Fitlingasse. The 
tug had departed; the houseboat, 
once more sound of hull, rode 
dark and silent on the water. 
Gersen alighted from the cab, 
went out on the dock. Silence. 
Lights from Dourrai glinted on 
the estuary. 

Gersen shook his head in 
mournful amusement. What 
more could be expected from an 
evening with a mad poet and a 
girl from Eridu? 

He returned to the cab and 
was conveyed to the Rembrandt 
Hotel. His quest had begun bad- 
ly .. but he had all the time 
in the world.

HOW THE 
HEROES DIE 

by LARRY NIVEN 

Illustrated by FINLAY 



Every man on Mars was a hero 
— but some heroes were more 
brave and daring than others! 



I 

/^nly sheer ruthlessness could 
have taken him out of town 
alive. The mob behind Carter 
hadn’t tried to guard the Mars- 
buggies, since Carter would have 
needed too much time to take 
a buggy through the vehicular 
airlock. They could have caught 
him there, and they knew it. 
Some were guarding the per- 
sonnel lock, hoping he’d try for 
that. He might have; for if he 



could have closed the one door 
in their faces and opened the 
next, the safeties would have 
protected him while he went 
through the third and fourth to 
the outside. On the Marsbuggy 
he was trapped in the bubble. 

There was room to drive 
around in. Less than half the 
prefab houses had been erected 
so far. The rest of the bubble- 
town’s floor was flat, fused sand, 
empty but for scattered piles of 
foam-plastic walls and ceilings 



53 



and floors. But they’d get him 
eventually. Already they were 
starting up another buggy. 

They never expected him to 
run his vehicle through the bub- 
ble wall. 

The Marsbuggy tilted, then 
righted itself. A blast of breath- 
ing air roared out around him, 
picked up a cloud of fine sand 
and hurled it explosively away 
into the thin, poisoned atmos- 
phere. Carter grinned as he 
looked behind him. They would 
die now, all of them. He was 
the only one wearing a pressure 
suit. In an hour he could come 
back and repair the rip in the 
bubble. He’d have to dream up 
a fancy story to tell when the 
next ship came . 

Carter frowned. What were 
they — 

At least ten wind-harried men 
were wrestling with the wall of 
a prefab house. As Carter 
watched, they picked the wall 
up off the fused sand, balanced 
it almost upright and let go. 
The foam-plastic wall rose into 
the wind and slapped hard 
against the bubble, over the ten- 
foot ' rip. 

Carter stopped his buggy to 
see what would happen. 

Nobody was dead. The air 
was not shrieking away but 
leaking away. Slowly, method- 
ically, a line of men climbed 
into their suits and filed through 
54 



the personnel lock to repair the 
bubble. 

A buggy entered the vehicu- 
lar lock. The third and last was 
starting to life. Carter turned 
his buggy and was off. 

Top speed for a Marsbuggy is 
about twenty-five miles per 
hour. The buggy rides on three 
wide balloon-tired wheels, each 
mounted at the end of a five 
foot arm. What those wheel’s 
can’t go over, the buggy can 
generally hop over on the com- 
pressed air jet mounted under- 
neath. The motor and the com- 
pressor are both powered by a 
Litton battery holding a tenth 
as much energy as the original 
Hiroshima bomb. 

Carter had been careful, as 
careful as he had had time for. 
He was carrying a full load of 
oxygen, twelve four-hour tanks 
in the air bin behind him, and an 
extra tank rested against his 
knees. His batteries were near- 
ly full; he would be out of air 
long before his power ran low. 
When the other buggies gave 
up he could circle round and 
return to the bubble in the time 
his extra tank would give him. 

His own buggy and the two 
behind him were the only such 
vehicles on Mars. At twenty- 
five miles per hour he fled, 
and at twenty-five miles per 
hour they followed. The closest 
was half a mile behind. 



GALAXY 



Carter turned on his radio. 

He found the middle of a 
conversation. “ — Can’t afford 
it. One of you will have to 
come back. We could lose two 
of the buggies, but not all 
three.” 

That was Shute, the bubble- 
town’s research director and sole 
military man. The next voice, 
deep and sarcastic, belonged to 
Rufus Doolittle, the biochem- 
ist. “What’ll we do, flip a coin?” 

“Let me go,” the third voice 
said tightly. “I’ve got a stake 
in this.” 

Carter felt apprehension touch 
the nape of his neck. 

“Okay, Alf. Good luck,” said 
Rufus. “Good hunting,” he add- 
ed maliciously, as if knew Car- 
ter was listening. 

“You concentrate on getting 
the bubble fixed. I’ll see that 
Carter doesn’t come back.” 

Behind Carter, the rearmost 
buggy swung in a wide loop to- 
ward town. The other came on. 
And it was driven by the lin- 
guist, Alf Harness. 

A ^ ost of the bubble’s dozen 
-^'^-*-men were busy repairing 
the ten-foot rip with heaters and 
plastic sheeting. It would be a 
long job but an easy one, for by 
Shute’s orders the bubble had 
been deflated. The transparent 
plastic had fallen in folds across 
the prefab houses, forming a se- 
HOW THE HEROES DIE 



ries of interconnected tents. One 
could move about underneath 
with little difficulty. 

Lieutenant-Major Michael 
Shute watched the men at work 
and decided they had things xin- 
der control. He walked away 
like a soldier on parade, stoop- 
ing as little as possible as he 
moved beneath the dropping 
folds. 

He stopped and watched 
Gondot operating the airmaker. 
Gondot noticed him and spoke 
without looking up. 

“Mayor, why’d you let Alf 
chase Carter alone?” 

Shute accepted his nickname. 
“We couldn’t lose both tractors.” 
“Why not just post them on 
guard duty for two days?” 

“And what if Carter got 
through the guard? He must be 
determined to wreck the dome. 
He’d catch us with our pants 
down. Even if some of us got 
into suits, could we stand an- 
other rip in the bubble?” 

Gondot reached to scratch his 
short beard. His fingertips rap- 
ped helmet plastic, and he look- 
ed annoyed. “Maybe not. I can 
fill the bubble anytime you’re 
ready, but then the airmaker’ll 
be empty. We’ll be almost out of 
tanked air by the time they fin- 
ish mending that rip. Another’ll 
finish us.” 

Shute nodded and turned 
away. All the air anyone could 

55 



use — tons of nitrogen and oxy- 
gen — were right outside; but 
they were in the form of nitric 
oxide gas. The airmaker could 
convert it three times as fast as 
men could use it. But if Carter 
tore the dome again, that would 
be too slow. 

But Carter wouldn’t. Alf would 
see to that. The emergency was 
over — this time. 

And so Lieutenant-Major 
Shute could go back to worrying 
about the emergency’s underly- 
ing causes. 

His report on those causes had 
been finished a month ago. He 
had reread it several times since, 
and always it had seemed com- 
plete and to the point. Yet he 
had the feeling it could be writ- 
ten better. He ought to make it 
as effective as possible. What he 
had to say could only be said 
once, and then his career would 
be over and his voice silenced. 

Cousins had sold some fiction 
once, writing as a hobby. Per- 
haps he would help. But Shute 
was reluctant to involve anyone 
else in what amounted to his 
own rebellion. 

Yet — he’d have to rewrite that 
report now, or at least add to it. 
Lew Harness was dead, mur- 
dered. John Carter would be 
dead within two days. All Shute’s 
responsibility. All pertinent. 

The decision wasn’t urgent. It 
would be a month before Earth 



was in reach of the bubbletown’s 
sending station. 

A /T ost of the asteroids spend 
most of their time between 
Mars and Jupiter, but it often 
happens that one of them cross- 
es a panet where theretofore it 
had crossed only an orbit. There 
are asteroid craters all over Mars 
— old eroded ones, sharp new 
ones, big ones, little ones, ragged 
and smooth ones. The bubble- 
town was at the center of a large, 
fairly recent crater four ^miles 
across : an enormous, poorly cast 
ash tray discarded on the red- 
dish sand. 

The buggies ran over crack- 
ed glass, avoiding the occasional 
tilted blocks, running uphill to- 
ward the broken rim. A sky the 
color of blood surrounded a tiny, 
brilliant sun set precisely at the 
zenith. 

Inevitably Alf was getting 
closer. When they crossed the 
rim and started downhill they 
would pull apart. It was going to 
be a long chase. 

Now was the time for regrets, 
if there ever was such a time. 
But Carter wasn’t the type, and 
he had nothing to be ashamed of 
anyway. Lew Harness had to 
die; had as much as asked to 
die. Carter was only puzzled that 
his death should have been pro- 
voked so violent a reaction. 
Could they all be— the way Lew 



56 



GALAXY 



had been? Unlikely. If he’d 
stayed and explained — 

They’d have torn him apart. 
Those vulpine faces, with the 
distended nostrils and the bared 
teeth! 

And now he was being chased 
by one man. But that man was 
Lew’s brother. 

Here was the rim, and Alf was 
still well behind. Carter slowed 
as he went over, knowing that 
the way down would be rougher. 
He was just going over the edge 
when a rock ten yards away 
exploded in white fire. 

Alf had a flare pistol. 

Carter just stopped himself 
from scrambling out of the bug- 
gy to hide in the rocks. The bug- 
gy lurched downward, and — like 
it or not — Carter had to forget 
his terror to keep the vehicle up- 
right. 

The rubble around the cra- 
ter’s rim slowed him still fur- 
ther. Carter angled the buggy 
for the nearest rise of sloping 
sand. As he reached it, Alf came 
over the rim, a quarter mile be- 
hind. His silhouette hesitated 
there against the bloody sky, 
and another flare exploded, 
blindingly bright and terrifying- 
ly close. 

Then Carter was on the 
straightaway, rolling down slip- 
ing sand to a flat horizon. 

The radio said, “Gonna be a 
long one. Jack.’’ 



Carter pushed to transmit. 
“Right. How many flares do you 
have left?’’ 

“Don’t worry about it.’’ 

“I won’t. Not the way you’re 
throwing them away.” 

Alf didn’t answer. Carter left 
the radio band open, knowing 
that ultimately Alf must talk to 
the man he needed to kill. 

The crater which was home 
dropped behind and was gone. 
Endless flat desert rose before 
the buggies, flowed under the 
oversized wheels and dropped 
behind. Gentle crescent dunes 
patterned the sand, but they 
were no barrier to a buggy. Once 
there was a Martian well. It 
stood all alone on the sand, a 
weathered cylindrical wall seven 
feet high and ten in circumfer- 
ence, made of cut diamond 
blocks. The wells and the slant- 
ing script written deep into their 
‘dedication blocks’ were respon- 
sible for the town’s presence on 
Mars. Since the only Martian 
ever found — a mummy centu- 
ries dead, at least — had explod- 
ed at the first contact with wa- 
ter, it was generally assumed 
that the wells were crematori- 
ums. But it wasn’t certain. Noth- 
ing was certain about Mars. 

''T^ie radio maintained an eery 
silence. Hours rolled past; 
the sun slid toward the deep red 
horizon, and still Alf did not 



HOW THE HEROES DIE 



57 



speak. It was as if Alf had 
said everything there was to say 
to Jack Carter., And that was 
wrong! Alf should have felt the 
need to justify himself! 

It was Carter who sighed and 
gave up. “You can’t catch me, 
Alf.” 

“No, but I can stay behind 
you as long as I need to.” 

“You can stay behind me just 
twenty-four hours. You’ve got 
forty-eight hours of air. I don’t 
believe you’ll kill yourself just 
to kill me.” 

“Don’t count on it. But I won’t 
need to. Noon tomorrow, you’ll 
be chasing me. You need to 
breathe, just like I do.” 

“Watch this,” said Carter. The 
O-tank resting against his knee 
was empty. He tipped it over 
the side and watched it roll 
away. 

“I have an extra tank,” he said. 
He smiled in relief at his release 
from that damning weight. “I 
can live four hours longer than 
you can. Want to turn back?” 

“No.” 

“He’s not worth it, Alf. Your 
brother was nothing but a queer.” 

“Does that mean he’s got to 
die?”' 

“It does if the son of a bitch 
propositions me. Maybe you’re a 
little that way yourself?” 

“No. And Lew wasn’t queer 
till he came here. They should 
have sent men and women.” 



“Amen.” 

“You know, lots of people get 
a little sick to their stomachs 
about homosexuals. I do myself, 
and it hurt to see it happening to 
Lew. But there’s only one type 
who goes looking for ’em so he 
can beat up on ’em.” 

Carter frowned. 

“Latents. Guys who think they 
might turn queer themselves if 
you gave ’em the opportunity. 
They can’t stand queers around 
because queers are temptation.” 
“You’re just returning the 
compliment.” 

“Maybe.” 

“Anyway, the town has enough 
problems without things like 
that going on. This whole proj- 
ect could have been wrecked by 
someone like your brother.” 
“How bad do we need kill- 
ers?” 

“Pretty badly, this time.” 

S uddenly Carter knew that he 
was now his own defense at- 
torney. If he could convince Alf 
that he shouldn’t be executed, 
he could convince the rest of 
them. If he couldn’t — then he 
must destroy the bubble or die. 
He went on, talking as persua- 
sively as he knew how. 

“You see, Alf, the town has 
two purposes. One is to find out 
if we can live in an environment 
as hostile as this one. The other 
is to contact the Martians. Now 



58

there are just fifteen of us in 
town — ” 

“Twelve. Thirteen when I get 
back.” 

“Fourteen if we both do. 
Okay? Each of us is more or 
less necessary to the functioning 
of the town. But I’m needed in 
both fields. I’m the ecologist, 
Alf. I not only have to keep the 
town from dying from some sort 
of imbalance, I also have to fig- 
ure out how the Martians live, 
what they live on, how Martian 
life forms depend on each other. 
You see?” 

“Sure. How ’bout Lew? Was 
he necessary?” 

“We can get along without 
him. He was the radio man. At 
least a couple of us have enough 
training to take over communi- 
cations.” 

“You make me so happy. 
Doesn’t the same go for you?” 

Carter thought hard and fast. 
Yes, Gondot in particular could 
keep the town’s life-support 
system going with little help. 
But — “Not with the Martian 
ecology. There isn’t — ” 

“There isn’t any Martian ecol- 
ogy- Jack, has anyone ever 
found any life on Mars besides 
that man-shaped mummy? You 
can’t be an ecologist without 
there being something to make 
deductions from. You’ve got 
nothing to investigate. So what 
good are you?” 



Carter kept talking. He was 
still arguing as the sun dropped 
into the sea of sand and dark- 
ness closed down with a snap. 
But he knew now it was of no 
use. Alf’s mind was closed. 

II 

T)y sunset the bubble was taut, 
^ ^ and the tortured scream of 
incoming breathing-air had drop- 
ped to a tired sigh. Lieutenant- 
Major Shute unfastened the 
clamps at his shoulders and lift- 
ed his helmet, ready to jam it 
dov/n fast if the air was too thin. 
It wasn’t. He set the helmet 
down and signalled thumbs-up 
to the men watching him. 

Ritual. Those dozen men had 
known the air would be safe. 
But rituals had grown fast where 
men worked in space, and the 
most rigid was that the man in 
charge fastened his helmet last 
and unfastened it first. Now 
suits were being removed. Men 
moved about their duties. Some 
moved toward the kitchen to 
clean up the vacuum-induced 
havoc so Hurley could get din- 
ner. 

Shute stopped Lee Cousins as 
he went by. “Lee, could I see 
you a minute?” 

“Sure, Mayor.” Shute was “the 
Mayor” to all bubbletown. 

“I want your help as a writer,” 
said Shute. “I’m going to send 



60 



GALAXY 



in quite a controversial report 
when we get within range of 
Earth, and I’d like you to help 
me make it convincing.” 

“Fine. Let’s see it.” 

The ten streetlamps came on, 
dispelling the darkness which 
had fallen so suddenly. Shute 
led the way to his prefab bun- 
galow, unlocked the safe and 
handed Cousins the manuscript. 
Cousins hefted it. “Big,” he said. 
“Might pay to cut it.” 

“By all means if you find any- 
thing unnecessary.” 

“I’ll bet I can,” Cousins grin- 
ned. He dropped on the bed and 
began to read. 

Ten minutes later he asked, 
“Just what IS the incidence of 
homosexuality in the Navy?” 

“I haven’t the faintest idea.” 
“Then it’s not powerful evi- 
dence. You might quote a limer- 
ick to show that the problem’s 
proverbial. I know a few.” 
“Good.” 

A little later Cousins said, “A 
lot of schools in England are co- 
educational. More every year.” 
“I know. But the present 
problem is among men who 
graduated from boys’ schools 
when they were much younger.” 
“Make that clearer. Inciden- 
tally was your school coeduca- 
tional?” 

“No.” 

“Any queers?” 

“A few. At least one in every 
HOW THE HEROES DIE 



class. The seniors used to use 
paddles on the ones they sus- 
pected.” 

“Did it help?” 

“No. Of course not.” 

“Okay. You’ve got two sets of 
circumstances under which a 
high rate of homosexuality oc- 
curs. In both cases you’ve got 
three conditions : a reasonable 
amount of leisure, no women, 
and a disciplinary pecking or- 
der. You need a third example.” 
“I couldn’t think of one.” 
“The Nazi organization.” 
“Oh?” 

“I’ll give you details.” Cous- 
ins went on reading. He finished 
the report and put it aside. 
“This’ll cause merry hell,” he 
said. 

“I know.” 

Ct^'T^he worst thing about it is 
-*■ your threat to give the 
whole thing to the newspapers. If 
I were you I’d leave that part of 
it out.” 

“If you were me you wouldn’t,” 
said Shute. “Everyone who had 
anything to do with WARGOD 
knew they were risking every- 
thing that’s happened. They pre- 
ferred to let us take that risk 
rather than risk public opinion 
themselves. There are hundreds 
of Decency Leagues in the Unit- 
ed States. Maybe thousands, I 
don’t know. But they’d all come 
down on the government like 

61 



Ill 



harpies if anyone tried to send 
a mixed crew to Mars or any- 
where else in space. The only 
way I can make the govern- 
ment act is to give them a great- 
er threat.” 

“You win. This is a greater 
threat.” 

“Did you find anything else to 
cut out?” 

“Oh, hell yes. I’ll go through 
this again with a red pencil. You 
talk too much, you use too 
many words that are too long 
and you generalize. You’ll have 
to give details, or it’ll lose its 
impact.” 

“I’ll be ruining some reputa- 
tions.” 

“Can’t be helped. We’ve got 
to have women on Mars — and 
right now. Rufe and Timmy are 
building up to a real spitting 
fight. Rufe thinks he caused 
Lew’s death by leaving him, and 
Timmy keeps taunting him with 
it.” 

“All right,” said Shute He 
stood up. He had been sitting 
erect throughout the discussion, 
as if sitting at attention. “Are 
the buggies still within radio 
range?” 

“They can’t hear us, but we 
can hear them. Timmy still is 
keeping busy working the bug- 
gy’s radio.” 

“Good. I’ll keep him on it 
until they go out of range. 

“Shall we get dinner?” 

62 



T)hobos rose where the sun had 
set, a scattering of moving 
dots of light, like a crescent of 
dim stars. It grew brighter as it 
rose: a new moon becoming a 
half moon in hours. Then it was 
too high to look at. Carter had 
to keep his eyes on the triangle 
of desert lit by his headlights. 
The headlight beams were the 
color of earthly sunlight, but to 
Carter’s Mars-adapted eyes they 
turned everything blue. 

He had chosen his course well. 
The desert ahead was flat for 
more than seven hundred miles. 
There would be no low hills 
rising suddenly before him to 
trap him into jet-jumping in 
faint moonlight or waiting for 
Alf to come down on him. Alf’s 
turnover point would come at 
high noon tomorrow, and then 
Carter would have won. 

For Alf would turn back to- 
ward the bubble, and Carter 
would go on into the desert. 
When Alf was safely over the 
horizon, Carter would turn left 
or right, go on for an hour, and 
then follow a course parallel to 
Alf’s. He would be in sight of 
the bubble an hour later than 
Alf, with three hours in which to 
plan. 

Then would come the hardest 
part. Certainly there would be 
someone on guard. Carter would 

GALAXY 



have to charge past the guard — 
who might be armed with a flare 
pistol — tear the bubble open and 
somehow confiscate the supply 
of O-tanks. Ripping the bubble 
open would probably kill every- 
one inside, but there would be 
men in suits outside. He would 
have to load some of the O- 
ranks on his buggy and open 
the stopcocks of the rest, all 
before anyone reached him. 

What bothered him was the 
idea of charging a flare pistol. 
But perhaps he could just aim 
the buggy and jump out. He 
would have to see. 

His eyelids were getting heavy, 
and his hands were cramped. 
But he dared not slow down, 
and he dared not sleep. 

Several times he had thought 
of smashing the come-hither in 
his suit radio. With that thing 
constantly beeping, Alf could 
find him anytime he pleased. 
But Alf could find him anyway. 
His headlights were always be- 
hind, never catching up, never 
dropping away. If he ever got 
out of Alf’s sight, that come- 
hither would have to go. But 
there was no point in letting Alf 
know that. Not yet. 

Stars dropped into the black 
western horizon. Phobos rose 
again, brighter this time, and 
again became too high to watch. 
Diemos now showed above the 
steady shine of Alf’s headlights. 

HOW THE HEROES DIE 



Quddenly it was day, and here 
^ and there were thin black 
shadows pointing to a yellow 
horizon. Stars still glowed in a 
red-black sky. There was a 
crater ahead, a glass dish set in 
the desert, not too big to circle 
around. Carter angled left. The 
buggy behind him also angled, 
if he kept turning like this, Alf 
couldn’t help but gain on him. 
Carter sucked water and nutri- 
ent solution from the nipples in 
his helmet and concentrated on 
steering. His eyes felt gritty, 
and his mouth belonged to a 
Martian mummy. 

“Morning,” said Alf. 

“Morning. Get plenty of sleep?” 

“Not enough. I only slept 
about six hours, in snatches. I 
kept worrying you’d turn off 
and lose me.” 

For a moment Carter went 
hot and cold. Then he knew 
that Alf was needling him. He’d 
no more slept than Carter had. 

“Look to your right,” said 
Alf. 

To their right was the crater 
wall. And — Carter looked again 
to be sure — there was a silhou- 
ette on the rim, a man-shaped 
shadow against the red sky. 
With one hand it balanced some- 
thing tall and thin. 

“A Martian,” Carter said soft- 
ly. Without thinking he turned 
his buggy to climb the wall. Two 
flares exploded in front of him, 

63 



a second apart, and fae franti- 
cally jammed the tiller bar hard 
left. 

“God damn it, Alf! That was 
a Martian! We’ve got to go after 
it!” 

The silhouette was gone. No 
doubt the Martian had run for 
its life when it saw the flares. 

Alf said nothing. Nothing at 
all. And Carter rode on, past 
the crater, with a murderous 
fury building in him. 

I t was eleven o’clock. The tips 
of a range of hills were push- 
ing above the western horizon. 

“I’m just curious,” Alf said, 
“but what would you have said 
to that Martian?” 

Carter’s voice was tight and 
bitter. “Does it matter?” 

“Yah. The best you could 
have done was scare him. When 
we get in touch with the Mar- 
tians, we’ll do it just the way 
we planned.” 

Carter ground his teeth. Even 
without the accident of Lew 
Harness’ death, there was no 
telling how long the translation 
plan would take. It involved 
three s'teps: sending pictures of 
the writings on the crematory 
wells and other artifacts to 
Earth, so that computers could 
translate the language; writing 
messages in that language to 
leave near the wells where Mar- 
tians would find them; and then 
64 



waiting for the Martians to make 
a move. 

But there was no reason to 
believe that the script on the 
wells wasn’t from more than one 
language or from the same lan- 
guage as it had changed over 
thousand of years. There was 
no reason to assume the Mar- 
tians would be interested in 
strange beings living in a glori- 
fied balloon, regardless of wheth- 
er the invaders knew how to 
write. And could the Martians 
read their own ancestors’ .script? 

An idea . “You’re a lin- 
guist,” said Carter. No answer. 

“Alf, we’ve talked about 
whether the town needed Lew, 
and we’ve talked about whether 
the town needs me. But how 
about you? "Without you we’d 
never get the well -script trans- 
lated.” 

“I doubt that. The CalTech 
computers are doing most of the 
work, and anyhow I left notes. 
But so what?” 

“If you keep chasing me you’ll 
force me to kill you. Can the 
town afford to lose you?” 

“You can’t do it. But I’ll make 
you a deal if you want. It’s 
eleven now. Give me two of your 
O-tanks, and we’ll go back to 
town. We’ll stop two hours from 
town, leave your buggy, and 
you’ll ride the rest of the way 
tied up in the air bin. Then you 
can stand trial.” 



GALAXY 



“You think they’ll let me 
off?” 

“Not after the way you ripped 
the bubble open on your way 
out. That was a blunder, Jack.” 

“Why don’t you just take one 
tank?” If Alf did that, Carter 
would get back with two hours 
to spare. He knew, now, that he 
would have to wreck the bubble. 
He had no alternative. But Alf 
would be right behind him with 
the flare gun . 

“No deal. I wouldn’t feel safe 
if I didn’t know you’d run out 
of air two hours before we got 
back. You want me to feel safe, 
don’t you?” 

It was better the other way. 
Let Alf turn back in an hour. 
Let Alf be in the bubble when 
Carter returned to tear it open. 

C Charter turned him down,” 
said Timmy. He hunched 
over the radio, holding his ear- 
phones with both hands, listen- 
ing with every nerve for voices 
which had almost faded away. 

“He’s planning something,” 
Gondot said uneasily. 

“Naturally,” said Shute. “He 
wants to lose Alf, return to the 
bubble and wreck it. What other 
hope has he?” 

“But he’d die too,” said Tim- 
my. 

“Not necessarily. If he killed 
us all he could mend the new 
rip while he lived on the O-tanks 
HOW THE HEROES DIE 



we’ve got left. I think he could 
keep the bubble in good enough 
repair to keep one man alive.” 
“My Lord! What can we do?” 
“Relax, Timmy. It’s simple 
math.” It was easy for Lieuten- 
ant-Major Shute to keep his 
voice light, and he didn’t want 
Timmy to start a panic. “If Alf 
turns back at noon, Carter can’t 
get here before noon tomorrow. 
At four he’ll be out of air. We’ll 
just keep everyone in suits for 
four hours.” Privately he won- 
dered if twelve men could re- 
pair even a small rip before they 
used up the bottled air. It would 
be one tank every twenty min- 
utes . but perhaps they 

wouldn’t be tested. 

“Five minutes of twelve,” said 
Carter. “Turn back, Alf. You’ll 
only get home with ten minutes 
to spare.” 

The linguist chuckled. A quar- 
ter mile behind, the blue dot of 
his buggy didn’t move. 

“You can’t fight mathematics, 
Alf. Turn back.” 

“Too late.” 

“In five minutes it will be.” 
“I started this trip short an 
O-tank. I should have turned 
two hours ago.” 

Carter had to wet his lips 
from the water nipple before he 
answered. “You’re lying. Will 
you stop bugging me? Stop it!” 
Alf laughed. “Watch me turn 
back.” 



65 



i His buggy came on quickly. 

;■ It was noon, and the chase 
would not end. At twenty-five 
miles per, two Marsbuggies a 
quarter of a mile apart moved 
serenely through an orange des- 
ert. Chemical stains of green rose 
ahead and fell behind. Crescent 
dunes drifted by, as regular as 
waves on an ocean. The ghostly 
path of a meteorite touched the 
northern horizon in a momen- 
tary white flash. The hills were 
higher now, humps of smooth 
rock-like animals sleeping be- 
yond the horizon. The sun burn- 
ed small and bright in a sky 
reddened by nitric oxide and, 
near the horizon, blackened by 
its thinness to the color of 
bloody India ink. 

Had the chase really started 
at noon? Exactly noon? But it 
was twelve thirty now, and he 
was sure that was too late. 

Alf had doomed himself — to 
doom Carter. 

But he wouldn’t. 

“Great minds think alike,” he 
told the radio. 

“Really?” Alf’s tone said he 
couldn’t have cared less. 

“You took an extra tank.” 
“No I didn’t. Jack.” 

“You must have. If there’s 
one thing I’m sure of in life, it’s 
that you are not the type to kill 
yourself. All right, Alf, I quit. 
Let’s go back.’ ’ 

“Let’s not.” 



“We’d have three hours to 
chase that Martian.” 

A flare exploded behind his 
buggy. Carter sighed ragged- 
ly. At two o’clock both buggies 
would turn back to bubbletown, 
where Carter would probably be 
executed. 

But suppose I turn back now? 

That’s easy. Alf will shoot me 
with the flare §un. 

He might miss. If I let him 
choose my course. I’ll die for 
certain. 

Carter sweated and cursed 
himself, but he couldn’t do it. 
He couldn’t deliberately turn 
into Alf’s gun. 

At two o’clock the base of the 
range came over the horizon. 
The hills were incredibly clear, 
almost as clear as they would 
have been on the Moon. But 
they were horribly weathered, 
and the sea of sand lapped 
around them as if eager to fin- 
ish them off, to drag them 
down. 

Carter rode with his eyes 
turned behind. His watch hands 
moved on, minute to minute, 
and Carter watched in disbelief 
as Alf’s vehicle continued to fol- 
low. As the time approached and 
reached two thirty. Carter’s dis- 
belief faded. It didn’t matter, 
now, how much oxygen Alf had. 
They had passed Carter’s turn- 
over point.

GALAXY 



“You’ve killed me,” he said. 
No answer. 

“I killed Lew in a fistfight. 
What you’ve done to me is much 
worse. You’re killing me by slow 
torture. You’re a demon, Alf.” 
“Fistfight my aunt’s purple as- 
terisk. You hit Lew in the throat 
and watched him drown in his 
own blood. Don’t tell me you 
didn’t know what you were do- 
ing. Everybody in town knows 
you know karate.” 

“He died in minutes. I’ll need 
a whole day!” 

“You don’t like that? Turn 
around and rush my gun. It’s 
right here waiting.” 

We could get back to the cra- 
ter in time to search for that' 
Martian. That’s why I came to 
Mars. To learn what’s here. So 
did you, Alf. Come on, let’s turn 
back.” 

“You first.” 

But he couldn’t. He couldn’t. 
Karate can defeat any hand-to- 
hand weapon but a quarterstaff, 
and Carter had quarterstaff 
training too. But he couldn’t 
charge a flare gun! Not even if 
Alf meant to turn back. And Alf 
didn’t. 

IV 

\ faint whine vibrated through 
the bubble. The sandstorm 
was at the height of its fury, 
which made it about as dan- 
HOW THE HEROES DIE 



gerous as an enraged caterpillar. 
At worst it was an annoyance. 
The shrill, barely audible whine 
could get on one’s nerves, and 
the darkness made street lamps 
necessary. Tomorrow the bubble 
would be covered a tenth of an 
inch deep in fine. Moon-dry 
silt. Inside the bubble it would 
be darker than night until some- 
one blew the silt away with an 
O-tank. 

To Shute the storm was de- 
pressing. Here on Mars was 
Lieutenant-Major Shute, Boy 
Hero, facing terrifying dangers 
on the frontiers of human ex- 
ploration! A sandstorm that 
wouldn’t have harmed an infant. 
Nobody here faced a single dan- 
ger that he had not brought with 
him. 

Would it be like this forever? 
Men traveling enormous dis- 
tances to face themselves? 

There had been little work 
done since noon today. Shute 
had given up on that. On a 
stack of walls sat Timmy, prac- 
tically surrounding the buggy- 
pickup radio, surrounded in turn 
by the bubble’s population. 

Timmy stood up as Shute ap- 
proached the group. “They’re 
gone,” he announced, sounding 
very tired. He turned off the 
radio. The men looked at each 
other, and some got to their 
feet. 

“Tim! How’d you lose them?” 

67 



Timmy noticed him. “They’re 
too far away, Mayor.” 

“They never turned around?” 
“They never did. They just 
kept going out into the desert. 
Alf must have gone insane^. Car- 
ter’s not worth dying for.” 
Shute thought — But he was 
once. Carter had been one of the 
best: tough, fearless, bright, en- 
thusiastic. Shute had watched 
him deteriorate imder the bore- 
dom and the close quarters 
aboard ship. He had seemed to 
recover when they reached Mars, 
when all of them suddenly had 
work to do. Then, yesterday 
morning — murder. 

Alf. It was hard to lose Alf. 
Lew had been little loss, but 
Alf— 

Cousins dropped into step be- 
side him. “I’ve got that red- 
pencil work done.” 

“Thanks, Lee. I’ll have to do 
it all over now.” 

“Don’t do it over. Write an 
addendum. Show how and why 
three men died. Then you can 
say, T told you so.’ ” 

“You think so?” 

“My professional judgment. 
When’s the funeral?” 

“Day after tomorrow. That’s 
Sunday. I thought it would be 
appropriate.” 

“You can say all three services 
at once. Good timing.” 

To all bubbletown. Jack Car- 
ter and Alf Harness were. dead. 
68 



But they still breathed — 

'■^he mountains came toward 
them: the only fixed points 
in an ocean of sand. Alf was 
closer now, something less than 
four hundred yards behind. At 
five o’clock. Carter reached the 
base of the mountains. 

They were too high to go over 
on the air jet. He could see spots 
where he might have landed the 
buggy while the pump filled the 
jet tank for another hop. But for 
what ? 

Better to wait for Alf. 

Suddenly Carter knew that 
that was the one thing in the 
world Alf wanted. To roll up 
alongside in his buggy. To watch 
Carter’s face until he was sure 
Carter knew exactly what was 
to come. And then to blast Car- 
ter down in flames from ten feet 
away and watch while a bright 
magnesium-oxidizer flare burned 
through his suit and skin and 
vitals. 

The hills were low and shal- 
low. Even from yards away he 
might have been looking at the 
smooth flank of a sleeping beast 
— except that this beast was not 
breathing. Carter took a deep 
breath, noticing how stale the 
air had become despite the puri- 
fier unit, and turned on the com- 
pressed air jet. 

The air of Mars is terribly 
thin, but it can be compressed; 

GALAXY 



and a rocket will work any- 
where, even a compressed-air 
rocket. Carter went up, leaning 
as far back in the cabin as he 
could to compensate for the loss 
of weight in the O-tanks behind 
him, to put as little work as 
possible on gyroscopes that were 
meant to spin only in emergen- 
cies. He rose fast, and he tilted 
the buggy to send it skating 
along the thirty-degree slope of 
the hill. There were flat places 
along the slope, but not many. 
He should reach the first one 
easily . 

A flare exploded in his eyes. 
Carter clenched his teeth and 
fought the urge to look behind. 
He tilted the buggy backward 
to slow himself down. The jet 
pressure was dropping. 

He came down like a feather 
two hundred feet above the des- 
ert. When he turned off the jet, 
he could hear the gyros whining. 
He turned the stablizer off and 
let it run down. Now there was 
only the chugging of the com- 
pressor, vibrating through his 
suit. 

Alf was out of his buggy, 
standing at the base of the 
mountains, looking up. 

“Come on,” said Carter. “What 
are you waiting for?” 

“Go on over if you want to.” 

“What’s the matter? Are your 
gyros fouled?” 

“Your brain is fouled. Carter. 

HOW THE HEROES DIE 



Go on over.” Alf raised one arm 
holding it out stiffly. The hand 
showed flame, and Carter duck- 
ed instinctively. 

The compressor had almost 
stopped, which meant the tank 
was nearly full. But Carter 
would be a fool to take off, be- 
fore it was completely full. You 
got the greatest acceleration from 
an air jet during the first sec- 
onds of fhght. The rest of the 
flight you got just enough pres- 
sure to keep you going. 

But — Alf was getting into his 
buggy. Now the buggy was ris- 
ing. 

/barter turned on his jet and 
went up. 

He came down hard, three 
hundred feet high, and only then 
dared to look down. He heard 
Alf’s nasty laugh, and he saw 
that Alf was still at the foot of 
the mountains. It had been a 
bluff! 

But why wasn’t Alf coming 
after him? 

The third hop took him to the 
top. The first downhill hop was 
the first he’d ever made, and it 
almost killed him. He had to do 
his decelerating on the last rem- 
nants of pressure in the jet tank! 
He waited until his hands stop- 
ped shaking, then continued the 
rest of the way on the wheels. 
There was no sign of Alf as he 
reached the foot of the range 

69 



and started out into the desert. 

Already the sun was about to 
go. Faint bluish stars in a red- 
black sky outlined the yellow 
hills behind him. 

Still no sign of Alf. 

Alf spoke in his ear, gently, 
almost kindly. “You’ll just have 
to come back. Jack.” 

“Don’t hold your breath.” 
“I’d rather not have to. That’s 
why I’m telling you this. Look 
at your watch.” 

It was about six thirty. 

“Did you look? Now count it 
up. I started with forty-four 
hours of fresh air. You started 
with fifty-two. That gave us 
ninety-six breathing hours be- 
tween us. Together we’ve used 
up sixty-one hours. That leaves 
thirty-five between us. 

“Now, I stopped moving an 
hour ago. From where I am it’s 
almost thirty hours back to base. 
Sometime in the next two and a 
half hours, you’ve got to get my 
air and stop me from breathing. 
Or I’ve got to do the same for 
you.” » 

It made sense. Finally, every- 
thing made sense. “Alf, are you 
listening? Listen,” said Carter 
and he opened his radio panel 
and, moving by touch, found a 
wire he’d located long ago. He 
jerked it loose. His radio crack- 
led deafeningly, then stopped. 

“Did , you hear that, Alf? I 
just jerked my come-hither 
70 



loose. Now you couldn’t find me 
even if you wanted to.” 

“I wouldn’t have it any other 
way.” 

Then Carter realized what 
he’d done. There was now no 
possibility of Alf finding him. 
After all the miles and hours of 
the chase, now it was Carter 
chasing Alf. All Alf had to do 
was wait. 

Darkness fell on the west. 

V 

garter went south, and he went 
'' immediately. It would take 
him an hour or more to cross 
the range. He would have to 
leap-frog to the top with only 
his headlights to guide him. His 
motor would not take him up- 
hill over such a slope. He could 
use the wheels going down, with 
luck, but he would have to do 
so in total darkness. Diemos 
would not have risen; Phobos 
was not bright enough to help. 

It had gone exactly as Alf had 
planned. Chase Carter to the 
range. If he attacks there, take 
his tanks and go home. If he 
chooses to cross, he may be 
killed. Take his tanks. If he 
makes it, show him why he has 
to come back. Time it so he has 
to come back in darkness. If by 
some miracle he makes it this 
time — well, there’s always the 
flare gun. 



GALAXY 




HOW THE HEROES DIE 



71 




Carter could give him only 
one surprise. He would cross six 
miles south of where he was ex- 
pected and approach Alf’s buggy 
from the southeast? 

Or was Alf expecting that too? 

It didn’t matter. Carter was 
beyond free will. 

The first jump was like jump- 
ing blindfolded from a ship’s 
airlock. He’d pointed the head- 
lights straight down, and as he 
went up he watched the circle of 
light expand and dim. He an- 
gled east. First he wasn’t mov- 
ing at all. Then the slope slid 
toward him, far too fast. He 
back-angled. Nothing seemed to 
happen. The pressure under him 
died slowly, but it was dying, 
and the slope was a wavering 
blur surrounded by dark. 

It came up, clarifying fast. 

The landing jarred him from 
coccyx to cranium. He held him- 
self rigid, waiting for the buggy 
to tumble end-for-end down the 
hill. But the buggy was tilted at 
a horrifying angle, it stayed. 

Carter sagged and buried his 
helmet in his arms. Two enor- 
mous hanging tears, swollen to 
pinballs in the low gravity, drop- 
ped onto his faceplate and 
spread. For the first time he re- 
gretted all of it. Killing Lew, 
when a kick to the kneecap 
would have put him out of ac- 
tion and taught him a perma- 
nent, memorable lesson. Snatch- 
72 



ing the buggy instead of sur- 
rendering himself for trial. Driv- 
ing through the bubble — making 
every man on Mars his mortal 
enemy. Hanging around to 
watch what would happen — 
when, perhaps, he could have 
run beyond the horizon before 
Alf came out the vehicular air- 
lock. He clenched his fists and 
pressed them against his face- 
plate, remembering his attitude 
of mild interest as he sat watch- 
ing Alf’s buggy roll into the 
lock . 

Time to go. Carter readied 
himself for another jump. This 
one would be horrible. He’d be 
taking off with the buggy canted 
thirty degrees backward . 

• 

ait a minute. 

Thdre was something wrong 
with that picture of Alf’s buggy 
as it rolled toward the lock sur- 
rounded by trotting men. Defi- 
nitely something wrong there. 
But what? 

It would come to him. He 
gripped the jet throttle and 
readied his other hand to flip on 
the gyros the moment he was 
airborne. 

— Alf had planned so care- 
fully. How had he come away 
with one O-tank too few? 

And — if he really had every 
thing planned — how did Alf ex- 
pect to get Carter’s tanks if 
Carter clashed? 




GALAXY 



Suppose Carter crashed his 
buggy against a hill, right now, 
on his second jump. How would 
Alf know? He wouldn’t, not un- 
til nine o’clock came and Carter 
hadn’t shown up. Then he’d 
know Carter had crashed some- 
where. But it would be too late! 
Unless Alf had lied. 

That was it, that was what 
was wrong with his picture of 
Alf in the vehicular airlock. Put 
one O-tank in the air bin and 
it would stand out like a sore 
thumb. Fill the air bin and then 
remove one tank, and the hole in 
the hexagonal array would show 
like a full moon in a clear, black 
sky. There had been no such 
hole. 

Let Carter crash now, and Alf 
would know it with four hours 
in which to search for his buggy. 

Carter swung his headlights 
up to normal position, then 
moved the buggy backwards in 
a dead -slow half circle. The 
buggy swayed but didn’t topple. 
Now he could move down be- 
hind his headlights . 

VI 

NTiner oclock. If Carter were 
^ wrong then he was dead 
now. Even now Alf might be un- 
fastening his helmet, his eyes 
blank with the ultimate despair, 
still wondering where Carter had 
gotten to. But if he were right . 

HOW THE HEROES DIE 



Then Alf was nodding to him- 
self, not smiling, merely confirm- 
ing a guess. Now he was decid- 
ing whether to wait another five 
minutes on the chance that Car- 
ter was late, or to start search- 
ing now. Carter sat in his dark 
cabin at the foot of the black' 
mountains, his left hand clutch- 
ing a wrench, his eyes rivited on 
the luminous needle of the di- 
rection finder. 

The wrench had been the 
heaviest in his tool box. He’d 
found nothing sharper than a 
screwdriver, and that wouldn’t 
have penetrated suit fabric. 

The needle pointed straight 
toward Alf. , 

And it wasn’t moving. 

Alf had decided to wait. 

How long would he wait? 

Carter caught himself whis- 
pering, not loudly. Move, idiot. 
You’ve got to sdarch both sides 
of the range. Both sides and 
the top. Move. Move! 

Ye gods! Had he shut off his 
radio? Yes, the switch was 
down. 

Move. 

The needle moved. It jerked 
once, infinitesimally, and he was 
quiet. 

It was quiet a long time — 
seven or eight minutes. Then it 
jerked in the opposite direction. 
Alf was searching the wrong side 
of the hills! 

And then Carter saw the flaw 

73 



in his own plan. Alf must now 
assume he was dead. And if he, 
Carter, was dead, then he wasn’t 
using air. Alf had two hours ex- 
tra, but he thought he had four! 

The needle twitched and 
moved — a good distance. Carter 
sighed and closed his eyes. Alf 
was coming over. He had sensi- 
bly decided to search this side 
first; for if Carter was on this 
side, dead, then Alf would have 
to cross the range again to reach 
home. 

Twitch. 

Twitch. He must be at the 
top. 

Then the long, slow, steady 
movement down. 

Headlights. Very faint, to the 
north. Would Alf turn north? 

He turned south. Perfect. The 
headlights grew brighter . and 
Carter waited, with his buggy 
buried to the windshield in the 
sand at the base of the range. 

Alf still had the flare gun. De- 
spite all his certainty that Car- 
ter was dead, he was probably 
riding with the gun in his hand. 
But he was using his headlights, 
and he was going slowly, per- 
haps fifteen miles per hour. 

He would pass . twenty 
yards west . 

/barter gripped the wrench. 

Here he comes. 

There was light in his eyes. 
Don't see me. And then there 
7A 



wasn’t. Carter swarmed out of 
the buggy and down the sloping 
sand. The headlights moved 
away, and Carter was after 
them, leaping as a moonie leaps, 
both feet pushing at once into 
the sand, a second spent in fly- 
ing, legs straddled and feet 
reaching fonvard for the landing 
and another leap. 

One last enormous kangaroo 
jump — and he was on the O- 
tanks, falling on knees and fore- 
arms with feet lifted high so the 
metal wouldn’t clang. One arm 
landed on nothing at all where 
empty O-tanks were missing. 
His body tried to roll off onto 
the sand. He wouldn’t let it. 

The transparent bubble of 
Alf’s helmet was before him. 
The head inside swept back and 
forth; sweeping the triangle cre- 
ated by the headlights. 

Carter crept forward. He 
poised himself over Alf’s head, 
raised the wrench high and 
brought it down with all his 
strength. 

Cracks starred out in the plas- 
tic. Alf looked up with his eyes 
and mouth all wide open, his 
amazement unalloyed by rage 
or terror. Carter brought the 
weight down again. 

There were more cracks, long- 
er cracks. Alf winced and — fi- 
nally — brought up the flare gun. 
Carter’s muscles froze for an 
instant as he looked into its hell- 

GALAXY 



ish mouth. Then he struck for 
what he knew must be the last 
time. 

The wrench smashed through 
transparent plastic and scalp and 
skull. Carter knelt on the O- 
tanks for a moment, looking at 
the unpleasant thing he’d done. 
Then he lifted the body out by 
the shoulders, tumbled it over 
the side and climbed into the 
cabin to stop the buggy. 

Tt took him a few minutes to 
find his own buggy where 
he’d buried it in the sand. It 
took longer to uncover it. That 
was all right. He had plenty of 
time. If he crossed the range by 
1 2 :30, he would reach bubble- 
town on the last of his air. 

There would be little room for 
finesse. On the other hand, he 
would be arriving an hour be- 
fore dawn. They’d never see 
him. They would have stopped 
c.xpecting him, or Alf, at noon 
tomorrow — even assuming they 
didn’t know Alf had refused to 
turn back. 

The bubble would be empty 
of air before anyone could get 
into a suit. 

Later he could repair and fill 
the bubble. In a month Earth 
would hear of the disaster: how 
a meteorite had touched down 
at a corner of the dome, how 
John Carter had been outside at 
the time, the only man in a suit. 

HOW THE HEROES DIE 



They’d take him home, and he 
could spend the rest of his life 
trying to forget. 

He knew which tanks were his 
empties. Like every man in town, 
he had his own method of ar- 
ranging them in the air bin. He 
dumped six and stopped. It was 
a shame to throw away empties. 
The tanks were too hard to re- 
place. 

He didn’t know Alf’s scheme. 
He’d have to test Alf’s empties 
individually. 

Already Alf had thrown some 
away. (To leave space for Car- 
ter’s tanks?) One by one. Car- 
ter turned the valve of each 
tank. If it hissed, he put it in 
his own air bin. If it didn’t, he 
dropped it. 

One of them hissed. Just one. 

Five O-tanks .He couldn’t pos- 
sibly make a thirty-hour trip 
on five O-tanks. 

Somewhere, Alf had left three 
O-tanks where he could find 
them again. Just on the off 
chance — just in case something 
went terribly wrong for Alf and 
Carter captured his buggy. Car- 
ter still wouldn’t go home alive. 

Alf must have left the tanks 
where he could find them easily. 
He must have left them near 
here; for he had never been out 
of Carter’s sight until Carter 
crossed the range, and further- 
more he’d kept just one tank to 
reach them. The tanks were 

75 



nearby, and Carter had just two 
hours to find them. 

In fact, he realized, they must 
be on the other side of the range. 
Alf hadn’t stopped anywhere on 
this side. 

But he could have left them 
on the hillside during his jumps 
to the top ... 

In a sudden frenzy of hurry. 
Carter jumped into his buggy 
and took it up. The headlights 
shov/^ his progress to the top. 

'"T^he first red rays of sunlight 
found Lee Cousins and Rufe 
Doolittle already outside the 
bubble. They were digging a 
grave. Cousins dug in stoic si- 
lence. In a mixture of pity and 
disgust he endured Rufe’s con- 
stant compulsive flow of words. 

“ . first man to be buried 
on another planet. Do you think 
Lew would have liked that? No, 
he’d hate it. He’d say it wasn’t 
worth dying for. He wanted to 
go home. He would have, too, 
on the next ship ...” 

The sand came up in loose, 
dry shovelfuls. Practice was 
needed to keep it on the shovel. 
It tried to flow like a viscous 
liquid.' 

“I tried to tell the Mayor 
he’d have liked a well burial. 
The Mayor wouldn’t listen. He 
said the Martians might not — 
Heyr 

Cousins’ eyes jerked up, and 

76 



the movement caught them — a 
steadily moving fleck on the 
crater wall. Martian! was his 
first thought. What else could be 
moving out there? And then he 
saw that it was a buggy. 

To Lee Cousins it was like a 
corpse rising from its grave. The 
buggy moved like a blind thing 
down the tilted blocks of old 
glass, touched the drifted sand 
in the crater floor, all while he 
stood immobile. At the corner of 
his eye he saw Doolittle’s shovel 
flying wide as Doolittle ran for 
the bubble. 

The buggy grazed the sand, 
then began reclimbing the crater. 
Cousins’ paralysis left him, and 
he ran for the town’s remaining 
buggy. 

The ghost was moving at half 
speed. He caught it a mile be- 
yond the crater rim. Carter was 
in the cockpit. His helmet was 
in his lap clutched in a rigid 
death-grip. 

Cousins reported, “He must 
have aimed the buggy along his 
direction finder when he felt his 
air going. Give him credit,” he 
added and lifted a shovelful 
from the second grave. “He did 
that much. He sent back the 
buggy.” 

J ust after dawn a small biped 
form came afound a hill to 
the east. It walked directly to 
the sprawled body of Alf Har- 

GALAXY 



ness, picked up a foot in both 
delicate-looking hands and be- 
gan to tug the corpse across the 
sand, looking rather like an ant 
tugging a heavy breadcrumb. In 
the twenty minutes it needed to 
reach Alt’s buggy the figure 
never stopped to rest. 

Dropping its prize, the Mar- 
tian climbed the pile o^ empty 
O -tanks and peered into the air 
bin, tlicn down at the body. But 
there was no way such a small, 
weak being could lift such a 
mass. 

The Martian seemed to re- 
member something. It scrambled 
down the O-tanks and crawled 
under the buggy’s belly. 

Minutes later it came out, 
dragging a length of nylon line. 
It tied each end of the line to 
one of Alf’s ankles, then drop- 
ped the loop over the buggy’s 
trailer attachment knob. 

For a time the figure stood 
motionless above Alf’s broken 



helmet, contemplating its work. 
Alf’s head might take a beating 
riding that way; but as a speci- 
men Alf’s head was useless. 
Wherever nitric oxide gas had 
touched moisture, red fuming 
nitric acid had formed. By now 
the rest of the body was dry 
and hard, fairly well preserved. 

The figure climbed into the 
buggy. A little fumbling, sur- 
prisingly little, and the buggy 
was rolling. Twenty yards away 
it stopped with a jerk. The Mar- 
tian climbed out and walked 
back. It knelt beside the three 
O-tanks which had been tied be- 
neath the buggy with the bor- 
rowed nylon line, and it opened 
the stopcocks of each in turn. 
It leapt back in horrid haste 
when the noxious gas began 
hissing out. 

Minutes later the buggy was 
moving south. The O-tanks 
hissed for a time, then were 
quiet. —LARRY NIVEN

private ship-to-ship band on 
which not even Cencom could 
eavesdrop. 

The Seld-Ilsa snorted unsym- 
pathetically. “You’re doing some- 
thing which is more than I can 
say in Mediatior Service; I’ve 
spent weeks and weeks on end 
waiting for them to make up 
their minds w'hich planetary cri- 



80 



sis is most crucial. By the time 
we get there, critical mass has 
been reached, and we have a 
helluva mess to clean up.” 
“You think MedServ doesn’t 
procrastinate?” Helva retorted 
sharply. “Why Jennan and I 
. ” and she stopped, startled 
to have been able to mention his 
name. 

lisa took advantage of the 
brief pause and grumbled on, 
oblivious to Helva’s stunned si- 
lence. 

“You’d think they’d’ve brief- 
ed use better in training. When 
I think of the situations I’ve 
already encountered that were 
never even mentioned! Theory, 
procedure, technique, that’s all 
we were handed. Not a single 
practical suggestion. Just gar- 
bage, garbage, trivial garbage. 
They don’t need brain ships, 
they need computers!” The 822 
ranted on. “Stupid, senseless, 
unemotional computers.” 

T_T elva spotted the fallacies in 
the 822’s complaints, but 
remained quiet. She and lisa had 
been classmates, and she knew 
from past experience the voids 
in the other’s personality. 

“I heard,” the 822 said con- 
fidentially, “that your mission 
has to do with that blue block 
building in the hospital annex.” 

Helva adjusted her right fin 
scanner, but the oblong struc- 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



ture was devoid of any unusual 
feature that would indicate its 
contents. 

“Have you heard when I’m 
supposed to hasten away from 
here again?” she asked lisa 
hopefully. 

“Can’t talk now; here comes 
Seld back. See you around.” 

Helva watched as the 822’s 
brawn-half ascended to the air- 
lock and the SI-822 lifted off 
Regulus Center Base. Seld had 
partied with Jennan in Helva 
one time when both ships were 
down at Leviticus IV. Seld had 
a passable bass, as she recalled it. 
Envy briefly touched her. She 
flicked back to the ambiguous 
hospital annex, savagely wonder- 
ing what kind of emergency this 
would be. And would she remain 
an X-designate the rest of her 
service life? 

She had set down at the end 
of tlie great Regulus field, the 
farthest edge from the Service 
Cemetery. Despite her resigna- 
tion to Jennan’s loss, despite 
Theoda’s healing tears, Helva 
could not bring herself to grind 
more salt into her sorrow with 
proximity to Jennan’s grave. 
Perhaps in a century or so . 
Consequently, waiting around on 
Regulus was painful. And with 
the 822 gone, she could no long- 
er divert her pain into anger at 
the prolonged wait she must en- 
dure. 



81 



“KH-834, your “brawn” is on 
her way with assignment tape,” 
Cencom alerted her. 

Helva acknowledged the mes- 
sage, excitement stirring within 
her. It was almost a relief to re- 
ceive a double-initial call, the 
pleasure overriding her twinge of 
regret that her “brawn” partner 
was feminine. It was a relief, 
too, to experience any emotion 
after the numbing of Jennan’s 
death. The Annigoni experience 
had broken her apathy. 

A groxmd car zipped out from 
the direction of the massive Con- 
trol and Barracks complex, skid- 
ding to a stop at her base. With- 
out waiting, Helva lowered the 
lift and watched as a tiny figure 
hefted three pieces of baggage 
onto the platform. 

“K” meant to stay a while, 
Helva decided. The lift ascend- 
ed, and shortly her new “brawn” 
was framed in the open lock, 
against the brilliant Regulan 
sky. 

“Kira of Canopus requesting 
permission to board the XH- 
834,” said the young woman, 
saluting smartly toward Helva’s 
position behind the titanium 
bulkhead. 

“Permission granted. Welcome 
aboard, Kira of Canopus.” 

The girl kicked the limp lump 
of a fabric bag unceremoniously 
aboard. But she carefully car- 
ried the other two back to the 
82 



pilot’s cabin. The odd-shaped 
one Helva identified, after a 
moment’s reflection, as an an- 
cient, stringed instrument called 
a guitar. 

Naturally they’d send me 
someone musically oriented, she 
thought, not at all sure she was 
pleased with this infringement 
on her most cherished memories 
of Jennan. She ruthlessly sup- 
pressed this unworthy thought 
with the admonition that the 
majority of Service personnel 
were musically oriented. The in- 
finite possibilities of the art 
passed travel time admirably. 

T^ira flipped open the other 
compact case, and Helva, 
surreptitiously peeking, noticed 
it was full of vials and other 
medical equipment. Kira in- 
spected the contents with quick 
fingers and, closing the case, 
strapped it with care against the 
rigors of acceleration on the 
shelves behind the bed. 

Kira was, in form and nature 
as well as sex, the antithesis of 
Jennan. Since she was in a carp- 
ing mood, Helva wondered how 
much of that was intentional. 
But that would mean Cencom 
had more sensitivity than Helva 
decided, privately, they were 
computationally blessed with. 

Kira of Canopus couldn’t weigh 
more than 40 kilos fully suited. 
Her narrow face with slanted 

GALAXY 



cheekbones had a delicacy which 
appeared ill-suited to bear the 
euphemism of “brawn” for the 
mobile half of a Service ship 
partnership. Her hair, dark 
brown, was braided tightly in 
many loops around her long 
oval skull. Her eyes, wide set 
and almond shaped, were of a 
clear, cool, deep green, thickly 
lashed. Her fingers, slim and 
tapering, were as dainty as her 
narrow feet, oddly graceful in 
heavy shipboots. Her movements, 
swift and sure, were quicksilver, 
full of restless energy, dartingly 
inquisitive. 

Kira reentered the main cab- 
in. Helva, used to Theoda’s le- 
thargic movements, had to ad- 
just quickly. 

Kira inserted the order tape, 
locking it into its niche in the 
pilot’s board. As the code ran 
through, a startled exclamation 
was wrung from Helva. 

“Three hundred thousand ba- 
bies?” 

Kira’s laugh was a staccato 
arpeggio of mirth. 

“Assignment Stork, by the ho- 
lies!” 

“You’re only temporary?” 
questioned Helva, trying to keep 
the irritation out of her voice. 
Even on brief acquaintance, there 
was a magnetism about Kira that 
appealed to Helva. 

Kira smiled wryly. “This as- 
signment will take some time. 

THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



Only thirty thousand are col- 
lected already. Even in this day 
and age, it takes time to make 
babies.” 

“I haven’t got facilities ...” 
Helva began aghast at the 
thought of becoming a nursery. 
She broke off as the tape elabor- 
ated on the condition of the pro- 
posed cargo. “Babies in rib- 
bons?” 

Kira, who had had previous 
briefing on their mission, laughed 
at Helva’s outraged reaction. 

The tape continued remorse- 
fully, and Helva understood the 
significance of the miles of 
plastic tubing and tanks of 
fluid which had been placed in 
her not overgenerous cargo 
spaces. 

In the system of the star Nek- 
kar, an unexpected radiation 
flare had sterilized the entire 
population of its newly colonized 
planet. A freak power failure 
had resulted in the total loss of 
the planet’s embryo banks. The 
KH-834’s mission was to rush 
embryos to Nekkar from planets 
which had answered the emer- 
gency call. 

II 

T n the very early days of space 
-*• travel, when man had still 
not walked on Mars or Jupiter’s 
satellites, a tremendous advance 
had been made in genetics. A 

83 



human fetus in its early stages 
was transferred from one womb 
to another, the host mother 
bringing the child to term and 
giving it birth without having an 
actual relationship to it. A sec- 
ond enormous stride forward in 
propagating the race of man oc- 
curred when a male sperm was 
scientifically united with a fe- 
male ovum. Fertilization was 
successful, and the resultant fe- 
tus was brought to term, the 
child growing to normal, well- 
balanced maturity. 

It became a requirement of 
those in hazardous professions or 
those with highly desirable dom- 
inant characteristics of intelli- 
gence or physical perfection to 
donate sperm and ova to what 
became known as Race Conser- 
vation Agency. 

As civilization expanded onto 
newer, rawly dangerous worlds, 
the accepted custom was for 
young men and women to leave 
their seed with the RCA on 
reaching their majority. It was 
good sense to have such a viable 
concentration of genetically cat- 
alogued seed available. So that, 
given a lack say, in a generation 
of a particularly desirable eth- 
nic group, sufficient additional 
embryos could be released to re- 
store the ecological balance. 

On an individual basis, the 
young wife, untimely widowed, 
might bear her husband’s chil- 
84 



dren from his seed on file at the 
RCA. Or a man, wishing a son 
of certain pronounced genetic 
characteristics to perpetuate a 
family name or business, would 
apply to the bank. There were, 
of course, ridiculous uses made 
of the RCA facilities: women in 
the thrall of hysteria over a 
noted spaceranger or artist would 
apply to the RCA for his seed 
if the male in question was 
agreeable. But naturally-con- 
ceived children were the rule 
rather than the exception. Helva 
herself had been the naturally 
inseminated child of her parents. 
The fact that some obscure birth 
defect had tendered her a gro- 
tesque, physical cripple was one 
of those curious, unpredictable 
accidents not even the most 
careful practice of prenatal care 
and obstetrics could avoid. She 
had been enlisted by her parents 
in Central Worlds’ Brain-ship 
Service. By the time she was 
three months old, she had been 
transferred to a shell which, 
by means of by-passing the 
damaged synapses connecting 
brain impulses to extremities, 
had enabled Helva to start her 
education as the controlling 
agency of a sleek, powerful 
spaceship. 

Generally, the RCA serves 
Central Worlds as a repository 
in case of just such an emer- 
gency as had arisen at Nekkar: 

GALAXY 



the inability of individuals to 
propagate the race. An appeal 
had reached the Main RCA on 
Elarth to locate and deliver 300, 

000 fertilized ova of genetic type 
similar to the Nekkarese. RCA 
had 30,000 on hand and had for- 
warded the call to all major 
RCA banks throughout the Cen- 
tral Worlds, asking for contribu- 
tions which the KH-834 would 
pick up and deliver to Nekkar. 

Ill 

''y^he tape ended with a silent 
-*■ hold cue to Helva. It took 
her a moment to realize that, 
though she had the mission in- 
formation, she had received noth- 
ing on her partner. No matter 
how temporary this assignment, 
it would take time; and some 
basic biography would be essen- 
tial for Helva to function effec- 
tively in partnership with Kira. 
Obediently she cut the tape, ac- 
tivating a record-store for the 
balance for later playback. It 
would appear there were many 
unusual factors in this assign- 
ment. Central Worlds moved in 
mysterious ways, itself to sus- 
tain. 

“Well,” Helva exclaimed to 
end the brief silence after the 
mission portion of the tape was 
silent. “I hadn’t expected moth- 
erhood at my tender age. I see 

1 had underestimated the de- 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



mands Central Worlds makes of 
its minions.” 

Her attempt at levity touched 
off a violent response in Kira, 
and Helva wondered what under 
a first magnitude star had she 
got for a partner. 

“Read this tape on me before 
we proceed with the mission,” 
Kira said in a dead voice, all 
her previous vivacity wiped out. 

She slammed the store but- 
ton, shunting the mission tape 
to the ship files, and inserted a 
second reel. With an almost sav- 
age twist she turned on the au- 
dio, sitting stiffly erect and mo- 
tionless as the tape played back, 
either deaf or impervious to the 
biograph. 

Kira Falemova Mirsky of 
Canopus had finished all but a 
year of “brawn” training. She 
came of a Service-oriented fam- 
ily which had brought up 
ten generations to illustrious, 
once exalted, careers in Cen- 
tral Worlds’ service branches. 
She had left the Training School 
on marital leave which had last- 
ed two years, ending at her hus- 
band’s death. A long term of 
hospitalization and therapy fol- 
lowed, during which time the 
tape noted that Kira had asked 
for and taken medical training, 
but did not reapply for “brawn” 
education. She had responded to 
a high level request to take this 
temporary assignment as her 

85 



training had matched perfectly 
the needs of this particular emer- 
gency. 

Then followed a rattle of per- 
sonal indices, emotional, psycho- 
logical and educational which 
Helva translated, as she was ex- 
pected to, to mean that Kira 
Mirsky of Canopus would make 
an unusually fine “brawn” if She 
gave herself half a chance. The 
tape ended abruptly, as if there 
should be more. The omission, 
probably on the last tag of the 
mission reel, seemed to sing out 
its absence far louder than the 
tritest concluding evaluation or 
recommendations. Central Worlds 
had many devious facets, and 
perhaps such an obvious omis- 
sion was one. Surely Kira sensed 
it. That damned biograph left 
too much unsaid, particularly 
apparent to a “brawn” trainee. 
Helva’s mind danced with the 
possibilities and gnawed mental 
teeth against the silent hold- 
cue. In the meantime, Helva 
was faced with a very awkward 
situation, her new partner still 
with anticipation and predisposed 
by Central Worlds to make a 
bad first adjustment to Helva. 

Helva made a rude, sibilant 
noise and was relieved to see 
Kira react in surprise to it. 

“Brains they got?” Helva de- 
manded contemptuously. “I don’t 
call that a proper tape. They 
forgot half the garbage anyway. 
86 



Ssscheh!” and she repeated her 
exasperation noise. “Oh, well, I 
expect we’ll do fine together, if 
only because they left out the 
usual nonsense. Besides, the mis- 
sion is temporary.” 

T^ira said nothing, but the 
woodenness left her slender 
body as if an anticipated ordeal 
had been cancelled. She swal- 
lowed hard, licking her lips ner- 
vously, still unsure of her posi- 
tion, having steeled her nerves 
for something unpleasant. 

“Let’s get the cargo aboard 
and turn me into a rocking ship.” 
Kira rose, her body awkward, 
but she managed to smile at 
Helva’s column. “With pleasure. 
Have your holds been outfitted?” 
“ ‘With yards and yards of 
lacing and a bicycle built for 
two on it,’ ” Helva replied, 
quipping from an ancient patter 
song. She was determined to es- 
tablish a comfortable empathy. 

Kira’s smile was less tentative, 
and her body motion became 
more fluid. 

“Yes, it would look like that, 
I guess.” 

“Of course I’ve never seen a 
bicycle built for two ...” 

“Or a purple cow?” and Kira 
giggled girlishly. Helva ignored 
the nervous edge to the laugh- 
ter, grateful the “brawn” did 
have such an active, if misplaced, 
sense of humor. 



GALAXY 



“Hmmm. Purple cow, my dear 
bravm, is an all too apt analogy 
for our present occupation. And 
don’t tell me I’ll have room for 
300,000 mechanical teats in the 
cargo space Central Worlds saw 
fit to give us.” 

“Oh, no,” Kira laughed. “We 
don’t have but the first hun- 
dred thousand accounted for as 
of the time the tape was cut. 
We’ll swing out from Regulus 
towards Nekkar, picking up do- 
nations as we go, deliver them 
within the four-week time limit, 
when the fetuses must be either 
implanted or decanted, and 
swing around the Wheel until 
we do meet the quota.” 

Helva knew this from the 
tape. “Three hundred thousand 
isn’t a very big number for a 
planetary population of a million 
that needs to expand.” 

“My dear KH-834,” Kira sav- 
ored the name, “the word ‘tem- 
porary,’ particularly when used 
by our beloved Service, has 
elastic qualities of infinite ex- 
pansion. Also, another team, with 
drone transports, is recruiting or- 
phans from unsooialized worlds 
to insure the proper age varia- 
tions. But born children aren’t 
our concern.” 

“The heavens be praised!” 
Helva muttered under her 
breath. She did not have room 
to transport active live bodies, 
and her one tragic experience 




THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



87 



with overcrowding as she outran 
Ravel’s exploding sun was not 
likely to recommend a similiar 
occurrence. 

Kira smiled back at Helva 
over her shoulder, as she con- 
tacted the Hospital Unit to re- 
quest transfer. 

Will you activate the pump- 
ing equipment?” she asked Hel- 
va, who was in the process of 
doing just that. 

''T^he miles of plastic tubing, 
once filled with the tiny 
sacs of fertilized ova, would 
contain the nutritive and amni- 
otic fluids necessary for the 
growth of the embryos. 

The continuous ribbon of tiny 
compartments, each with its mi- 
nute living organism, was pre- 
pared for the voyage with the 
caution and care of a major sur- 
gical operation on a head of 
planet. Each segment must con- 
tact an intake point for the nu- 
tritive fluid and an outgo valve 
for the dispersal of wastes. Each 
meter of ribbon was inspected 
to insure the proper contact 
was made. The ribbon and 
its fluids as well as the en- 
casing tube buffeted the embryos 
with more invulnerability against 
the rigors of space travel than 
had they been carried in a nat- 
ural womb. As long as the KH- 
834 made the journey to Nekkar 
within the four weeks, all 30,- 
88 



000 fetuses would live to be 
born. 

It became apparent to Helva 
that Kira was dedicated in a 
detached, if professional, way to 
the assignment. Central Worlds 
might be relying on a maternal 
instinct as additional insurance 
for the mission. Helva, to her in- 
ner amusement, found herself, 
the pituitarily inhibited shell- 
person, rising nobly to the chal- 
lenge. Kira, obviously young 
enough to someday enjoy moth- 
erhood, was completely unin- 
volved. Yet the affinity Helva 
felt towards these minute voy- 
agers was basically a shell re- 
action. They were, after all, en- 
capsulated as she was, the dif- 
ference being that they would 
one day burst from their scien- 
tific husks, as she never could 
nor even desired to. Still, she 
felt a growing protectiveness, 
above and beyond the ordinary, 
towards her passengers. The sit- 
uation didn’t appear to touch 
Kira’s psyche, and that puzzled 
Helva. 

She struggled to identify the 
coldness of Kira’s reaction and 
could not. Then the technicians 
who had effected the installation 
of the precious cargo withdrew, 
and Helva was busy with the 
mechanics of take-off. 

It was a pleasure to have a 
passenger who knew how to take 
care of herself. Not that Theoda 

GALAXY 



had been a burden in the psy- 
chological sense of the word, 
but Kira knew the procedures, 
and Helva did not need to spare 
a thought towards her. Take-off 
was under minimum thrust, not 
that the triply-buffeted embryos 
could suffer damage had she 
blasted off with all power, but 
Helva preferred to take no un- 
necessary chances, and there 
was plenty of time to reach 
Nekkar in Bootes’ sector. 

IV 

Thirst planet of call would be 
^ Talitha where forty -thou- 
sand future citizens of Nekkar 
had been prepared. After lift, 
Kira made a careful check on 
all circuits in the nursery, con- 
firmed her findings with Helva’s 
remote monitors and informed 
Cencom that they were clear of 
Regulus and driving towards 
Talitha. 

The formalities ended, Kira 
swung slowly around in the 
gimballed pilot’s chair. Her slen- 
derness lost in the padded arm- 
chair, she seemed both too fra- 
gile and too young for her re- 
sponsibilities. 

“The larder is well stocked,” 
Helva suggested. 

Kira stretched leisurely, slew- 
ing her shoulders around to ease 
the taut muscles across her 
back. She shook her head sharp- 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



ly, sending a shower of hair fas- 
teners slithering across the cab- 
in as her braids came tumbling 
out of the coronet. Helva watch- 
ed fascinated. Shoulder-length 
hair was the common fashion 
among spacewomen. The tips of 
Kira’s braids brushed the floor. 
Whatever maturity she possessed 
departed with the severe coif- 
feur. Like the prototype of an 
ancient fantasy creature, Kira 
rose from the pilot’s chair and 
moved across the deck to the 
galley. 

“You wouldn’t by any remote 
computational factor stock a 
beverage known as coffee?” Kira 
asked wistfully. 

Helva chuckled, remembering 
a similar plea from a med offi- 
cer named Onro. It seemed to 
be an occupational necessity. 

“I have three times as much 
as normal service inventory 
suggests,” Helva assured her. 

“Oh,” Kira’s eyes rolled up- 
wards in mock rapture, “you 
know! The ship that brought me 
here was a provincial transport 
from Draconis and hadn’t a drop 
on board. I nearly perished,” 
she exclaimed with lavish emo 
tion. 

Kira flipped open the proper 
cabinet and broke the heatseal, 
sniffing deeply as the fragrant 
aroma arose from the heating 
liquid. She gulped down a sip, 
grimacing against the heat. With 

89 



an expression of intense relief, 
she leaned against the counter. 
“You and I are going to do no- 
bly together, Helva. I’m sure of 
it.” 

Helva caught the rasp of fa- 
tigue in the lilting voice. Would 
she always receive passengers in 
the advanced stages of exhaus- 
tion? Or was something the mat- 
ter with Helva that all her vis- 
itors tended to fall asleep once 
aboard her? As a nursery ship 
this could be an asset, Helva 
thought acidly. 

“It’s been a long day for you, 
Kira. Why don’t you get some 
rest? I’m staying up anyway.” 

Kira chuckled, knowing that 
the brainships never slept. She 
glanced towards the cargo holds. 

“I’ll listen with all ears perk- 
ed,” Helva reassured her. 

“I’ll just finish my coffee and 
take a short snooze,” Kira 
agreed. At the cabin door she 
turned back towards Helva’s 
column, cocking her head slight- 
ly, her green eyes sparkling. 

“Helva, do you peek?” Her 
expression was prim to the purs- 
ing of her lips. 

“I assure' you,” Helva replied 
with great dignity, “I am a very 
properly mannered ship. Scout.” 

“I shall expect you to con- 
duct yourself decorously at all 
times as behooves a person in 
your position in life,” Kira re- 
plied so haughtily, that Helva 
90 



imagined her pedigree sprinkled 
with royal ancestors. 

Head high, Kira stepped into 
her cabin only to trip on one of 
her swinging braids and tumble 
into the room. Helva was sorely 
tempted to get a glimpse of 
Kira’s face. 

“Don’t you dare look in!” Kira 
exclaimed, her voice breaking 
with laughter. 

Helva had promised nothing 
about turning off sound, and 
Kira got to her feet, giggling 
softly. In a very short while 
only the sound of a sleeper’s 
shallow, slow breathing broke 
the stillness of the ship. 

T T elva took out of file the por- 
tion of the tape which fol- 
lowed the hold-cue. The excerpt 
was brief and enigmatic. 

“Scout Mirsky is a practicing 
Dylanist, accepting this assign- 
ment in Central World Service 
without suspension of her craft. 
Accordingly she is not to be per- 
mitted shore leave on the fol- 
lowing planets as her activities 
constitute an infringement of 
planetary laws restricting prose- 
lytization of government groups 
and/ or an embarrassment to 
Central World Service: Ras Al- 
gothi. Das Alhague and Sabek. 
Subject Scout and Ship desig- 
nate are not, repeat are not, to 
approach planets or stars Ba- 
ham and Homan in the Pegasus 

GALAXY 



Sector or planets of stars Beid 
and Keid in the Eridanus Sec- 
tor.” 

Nothing could be clearer than 
that, but the reasoning behind 
such restrictions was unfathom- 
able. And Kira was a practicing 
Dylanist, whatever that was. 
The name had a familiar ring, 
and the guitar which Kira cher- 
ished suggested a musical group 
of some sort. Well, mused Helva, 
she’d let it come up in conversa- 
tion naturally. 

The six days to Talitha were 
livened by Kira’s rapid switches 
of mood and manner, from gam- 
in to queen, welcome to Helva 
after both Theoda’s stolidness 
and as counterpoint to her pain- 
ful memories of Jennan. Helva 
literally did not know what Kira 
would do next. However, when it 
came time to check passengers, 
Kira was deftly professional and 
painstakingly thorough. 

Dubhe, the second planet on 
their tour, called in to con- 
firm a contribution of forty 
thousand fertilized ova, to be 
ready at the touchdown. Kira 
checked computations on ETA 
at Dubhe, arriving at the same 
figure simultaneously with Hel- 
va. Child she might look, child 
she might play, but Kira’s work- 
ing mind was sharp and accu- 
rate. 

The transfer at Talitha went 
without undue incident because 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



Kira’s acute attention to detail 
averted the one possible acci- 
dent. An attendant, too eager to 
finish his assignment, tripped 
over the leads to a fluid tank in 
the now crowded cargo hold. 

Kira lit into him with a furi- 
ous catalogue of his ancestors, 
his present worth, his future ca- 
reer potential and his probable 
imminent demise if he repeated 
his awkwardness. She did so in 
three languages, other than Ba- 
sic, that Helva knew and several 
that had the advantage of sound- 
ing even more vicious. Yet the 
minute she had exhausted her 
choler, she turned, coolly collect- 
ed, to the head of the detail 
with apologies. 

Once lifted from Talitha, Kira 
shook loose the pins that held 
her braids and settled in the 
pilot’s chair with a sigh of re- 
lief. 

“I caught three of your de- 
scriptions of him, but the oth- 
ers were beyond me.” 

“I find that old Terran Rus- 
sian, mixed with liberal neu- 
magyarosag, is extremely vitri- 
olic in sound,” Kira said with a 
satisfied smile. “Actually I was 
only repeating a recipe for a pro- 
tein dish called paprikash. It 
sounds much, much worse, 
doesn’t it?” She grinned broadly 
at Helva, her green eyes wide. 

“Effective, too. The oaf posi- 
tively blanched.”

“Thom ...” Kira cut off 
her words, pressing her lips firm- 
ly together, her face, for one 
tiny moment, showing inner 
pain. “I think,” she murmured, 
closing her eyes, “I’m hungry.” 
Her voice was breathless, like a 
child’s. “And,” her eyes flashed 
open, her face composed again, 
“I think I shall make papri- 
kash! Since, you realize, I have 
just furiously remembered the 
accurate recipe.” She danced 
across the floor. “Taught me by 
an old gypsy.” She waggled her 
finger at Helva. “Promise not to 
peek. It’s a family secret.” 

She pivoted on her toes, round 
and round into the galley, laugh- 
ing breathlessly as she caught 
the counter for support. 

“Doesn’t it smell heavenly?” 
Kira demanded of Helva, later 
pausing with the dish raised to 
Helva’s column. “Be better with 
noodles and thick cmsty bread. 
Hmm!” she mumbled happily 
over a full mouth. “Oh, perfect. 
I have not lost my touch.” She 
touched her fingers to her lips, 
releasing a kiss to the air in the 
extravagance of gustatory enjoy- 
ment. -“Marvelous.” She curled 
her legs under her on the wide 
pilot’s chair and ate quickly, 
licking her fingers occasionally 
when the stew splashed. 

“You make me wish I wasn’t 
nourished by a bunch of fla- 
gons,” Helva remarked. “I’ve 
92 



never seen anyone enjoy the 
simple business of eating as much 
as you do. And you don’t seem 
to suffer from excess calories.” 

Kira shrugged negligently. 
“Excellent metabolism. Abso- 
lutely unalterable. That’s me!” 
That fleeting edge of bitterness 
crept into the gay voice. 

T T elva began to suspect that 
these sudden switches of 
mood were less the product of 
a naturally volatile spirit than 
the elaborate defenses of a badly 
hurt woman, struggling to sup- 
press her pain by overriding all 
references to it. 

Helva remembered how care- 
fully the guitar case had been 
stowed in the closet. Not so 
much as a hint had Kira made 
that it was there, silently wait- 
ing. Was this out of deference 
to Helva’s recent tragedy? For 
surely Kira knew of Jennan’s 
death and the legends that had 
already begun to cling to the 
834. Or was Kira avoiding the 
guitar for a reason of her own? 

Kira finished her meal. The 
dish lay on her lap. Her face 
was brooding, eyes fixed on a 
spot at the base of the control 
console. 

Her whole attitude was apa- 
thetical and unhealthy. Helva 
knew she must break this mood. 
Kira had somehow been touched 
on too vital a point — despite the 

GALAXY 



overtly innocuous conversation — 
to help herself. 

Softly, without conscious 
choice from her wealth of musi- 
cal references, Helva began to 
sing an old air: 

Music for a while 
Shall all your cares be- 
guile; 

Wond’ring how your Pains 
were eased. 

'“How my pains are eased?” 
hissed Kira, her eyes great, 
green globes glittering with ha- 
tred on the titanium column. 
“Do you know how my pain will 
be eased?” She was on her feet 
in such violent upward heave 
that there seemed to be no in- 
termediate motion of rising. Tall 
in fury, Kira frightened Helva 
with the sudden strength in the 
slight body. “In death! In 
DEATH!”— and she held her 
arms straight up, wrists turned 
towards Helva so that she saw 
the thin white scars of arterial 
cuts. 

“You . .” Kira’s arms drop- 
ped rigid to her sides. “You had 
the chance to die. No one could 
have stopped you. Why didn’t 
you? What kept you living after 
he died?” the girl demanded 
with trenchant scorn. 

Helva drew in her breath 
sharply, against the tantalizing 
memory of an anguished desire 
to dive into the clean white heart 
of Ravel’s exploding sun. 

THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



“Do you realize that even, if 
a person wants to die, it is not 
allowed! Not allowedP’ Kira be- 
gan to pace wildly, graceful 
even in this savage mood. “No. 
You promptly are subjected to 
such deep conditioning you can- 
not. Anything else is permitted 
in our great society except the 
one thing you really want — if it 
happens to be death. Do you 
realize that I have never been 
left alone in tliree years? And 
now ...” Kira’s face was con- 
torted in ugly anger and con- 
tempt, “ . now you’re my 
nursemaid. And don’t think for 
one moment I’m not aware you 
have had a confidential report 
on my emotional instability.” 

“Sit down,” Helva ordered 
coldly and activated the final 
section of the mission tape with 
its restriction. As the import of 
the message reached Kira, she 
did sit, slumped lifeless in the 
pilot’s chair, her face drained of 
all emotion. 

“I’m sorry, Helva. I’m really 
sorry,” she raised trembling 
hands in apology. “I just didn’t 
believe they would leave me 
alone at last.” 

“They are very good at con- 
ditioning,” Helva remarked soft- 
ly. “They must be, and they 
have to be. They can’t have 
ships or people going rogue 
from grief. But I think they have 
let you alone. They’ve merely 

93 



made sure you can't get to those 
few worlds where ritual suicide 
is permitted, like Baham, Ho- 
man, Beid and Keid. And they 
can’t allow you to commit sui- 
cide because the ethos of Cen- 
tral Worlds is dedicated to ex- 
tending life and propagating it 
wherever and whenever possible. 
I’m a living example of the ex- 
tremes to which they are willing 
to go to sustain a human life. 
The RCA is another aspect of 
the same ethos. For you to seek 
suicide means a breakdown in 
this ethos which cannot be per- 
mitted. Even the Pegasus and 
Eridani planets limit the con- 
ditions under which suicide is 
condoned and proscribe certain 
grotesque ceremonies to insure 
that only the most desperate at- 
tempt it. 

“You’d think,” Helva sighed 
with exasperation, “they’d figure 
out someway to alleviate loss, 
since Death is the one thing the 
great and glorious Central 
Worlds hasn’t been able to cure.” 

ira’s tumbled hair hid her 
'^'^face from Helva’s view. 
Even the slim fingers were mo- 
tionless. The girl had abandoned 
herself to grief, and suddenly 
Helva was immeasurably irri- 
tated with this immolation in 
self-pity. True enough, she had 
been tempted to suicide, but her 
conditioning had held. She had 
94 



keened her loss to black space, 
but she had lifted with Theoda 
to Annigoni and gone on with 
the business of living. Just as 
Theoda had after her own trag- 
edy. As many people had all 
over the universe and through- 
out time. When her medical ad- 
visors had realized that Kira 
was wallowing in sorrow, they 
should have applied a block — 
oh, no, not when Kira had near- 
ly finished “brawn” training; 
Helva remembered that factor. 
She had been made block-resis- 
tant, so the only therapy was 
intensive conditioning. They 
couldn’t erase, only inhibit. 

Helva looked dispassionately 
at her “brawn,” furious at her 
situation, realizing that Central 
Worlds had known exactly what 
they were asking of Helva when 
they assigned Kira to her. That, 
too, was part of the ethos. Use 
what you have that wiU get the 
job done. 

“Kira, what is a Dylanist?” 

The lowered head jerked up, 
the curtaining hair falling away 
from the face. The scout blink- 
ed and turned to stare at Hel- 
va’s bulkhead. 

“Well, that is the last ques- 
tion I would have expected,” 
she said in a quiet voice. She 
gave a little snort of laughter 
and then tossed her head, shak- 
ing her hair out of her way. 
She looked at Helva thought- 

GALAXY 



fully, speculatively. “All right. 
I’ll absolve you of the guilty 
crime of psychotherapy. Altho’,” 
Kira began pointing an accusa- 
tory finger at the column, “I 
was coerced to make this mis- 
sion, and I thought it awfully 
suspicious that you were to be 
my ship.” 

“Yes, that would follow logic- 
ally, wouldn’t it?” Helva agreed 
calmly. 

Kira laid a slim hand on the 
bulkhead, on the square plate 
that was the only access to 
Helva’s titanium shell within the 
column. It was a gesture of 
apology and entreaty, simple 
and swift. Had Helva been 
aware of sensory values, it 
would have been the lightest of 
pressures. 

“A Dylanist is a social com- 
mentator, a protestor, only with 
music. A skilled Dylanist, and I 
wasn’t one ...” (from the em- 
phasis on the pronoun, Helva 
assumed that Kira considered 
her husband. Thorn, had been 
one) “ . can make so com- 
pelling an argument with melo- 
dy and words that what he 
wants to say becomes insinuat- 
ed into the subconscious.” 

“Subliminal song?” Helva 
questioned. 

“Well, haven’t you been 
haunted by a melody?” Kira 
paused at the door of her cab- 
in. 

THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



“Hmmm, yes, I have,” Helva 
agreed, not sure that the theme 
from Rovolodorus’ Second Ce- 
lestial Suite was exactly what 
Kira had in mind. Still the point 
was well taken. 

“A really talented Dylan styl- 
ist,” Kira continued, returning 
with the guitar case, “can create 
a melody with a message that 
everyone sings or hums, whis- 
tles, spits or drums in spite of 
himself. Why, you can even 
wake up in the morning with 
a good Dylan-styled song sing- 
ing in your head. You can 
imagine how effective that is 
when you’re proselytizing for a 
cause.” 

Helva roared with laughter. 
“No wonder you’d be consider- 
ed an embarrassment to Central 
Worlds on the Ophiuchus cir- 
cuit.” 

Kira grinned impishly. “I got 
the chapter, verse and section 
on that, plus what a waste of 
time, talent and ability that 
could be put to worthwhile use 
in service to C.W.” 

Che made a face as she struck 
chords, sour from long dis- 
use. She tightened the keys, 
tuning the chords up from the 
bass string, her expression un- 
expectedly tender as she work- 
ed. She struck a tentative chord, 
tightened the E string a frac- 
tion more and nodded satisfac- 

95 



tion at the resulting, mellow 
sound. 

With flashing strong fingers 
she wove a pattern of chords 
and notes, drawing more vol- 
ume from the instrument than 
its fragile structure suggested. 
To Helva’s amazement, she 
recognized an ancient Bach 
fugue just as Kira struck an 
angry discord, clamping both 
hands on the strings to keep 
them from resonating. 

“Achh,” she exclaimed, sharp- 
ly flapping her hands and then 
clenching them into tight fists. 
“I haven’t played since . ” 
She struck a major chord, then 
modulated to a diminishing mi- 
nor. “I remember we spent one 
entire night — till noon the 
next day, actually — trying to 
analyze an early Dylan song. 
The trouble was, you weren’t 
supposed to analyze Dylan. You 
had to feel him, and if you 
tried to parse what he was say- 
ing into Basic or into psycho- 
logical terms, it ... it was 
meaningless. It was the total 
imagery of the music and the 
words that made the gut re- 
act. That was the whole purpose 
of his style. When the gut re- 
acts, the mind gets the whiplash, 
and another chip is knocked off 
the solid block within.” 

“I’d say his work might be 
good therapy,” Helva remarked 
dryly. 

96 



Kira flashed her an angry 
look which dissolved into a grin. 
She made her guitar laugh. 
“The trouble with therapy is 
you tend to find too many con- 
fusing alternative meanings to 
the simplest notions and words, 
and then you’re so confused, 
you suspect everyone and every- 
thing.” And Kira’s guitar echoed 
the pitch of her words derisive- 
ly- 

A red warning light flashed 
on the panel simultaneously 
with an impulse to Helva’s in- 
ternal monitors. The guitar was 
the sole occupant of the pilot’s 
chair, and Kira was halfway 
down the passageway to the 
number three hold before Helva 
could activate her own visual 
check. 

Kira paused at the door long 
enough to assess the damage, 
before she spun to the further 
hold where their additional sup- 
plies were stored. 

The clumsiness of the tech- 
nician had, to all scrutiny, been 
remedied at the time of the 
accident by securing the tub- 
ing in the demijohn of nutri- 
tive fluid. What had not been 
apparent at that time was that 
the closure at the other end 
of the line had been loosened. 
Sufficient fluid had dripped 
away from the weakened joint 
to register on the telltale. Helva 
anxiously checked with her 

GALAXY 



magnified vision along the sec- 
tion of embryos that tank ser- 
viced. There was loss at the 
joint but the ribbon was still 
fuU. 

Kira was back with new tub- 
ing and joints. Deftly she re- 
moved the faulty equipment, 
careful in her transfer to pre- 
vent air bubbles seeping in 
along the ribbon. Then Kira 
carefully checked the entire 
length of ribbon and each min- 
ute sac under magnification to 
make certain there were no vis- 
ible bubbles or disruptions to the 
contact between sac top and 
the nutritive nipple fastening. 

Then she checked the joints 
in the other ribbons, each line, 
each flask, every connection. It 
was a job of several hours dura- 
tion, but she made no attempt 
to hasten the process. 

Reassured, she and Helva did 
another check of the internal 
monitors before she closed the 
hatch. 

“I should have cut him up 
and made him into the papri- 
kash. That would have served 
him right!” Kira muttered as 
she disappeared into the pri- 
vacy of her cabin. 

Helva eavesdropped until she 
heard the slow, even breathing. 
All the while, the stiU guitar 
stared back at her from the 
pilot’s scat, threads of that 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



haunting melody taunting Helva 
as she watched. 

V 

A t Dubhe, Kira listened on an 
^ elaborate spectrum inspec- 
tion of the disturbed ribbon to 
make sure none of the several 
thousand fetuses within the 
strand had suffered impair- 
ment. Whatever emotional prob- 
lems tormented Kira, she held 
them apart from her profes- 
sional life. Her objectivity was 
appreciated by Helva the more 
because she had had a glimpse 
of Kira’s personal turmoil. 

The KH-834 sped onward 
from Dubhe to Merak where 
another twenty thousand wait- 
ed. On the short voyage between 
Dubhe and Merak, neither Kira 
nor Helva mentioned what Hel- 
va styled “the paprikash inci- 
dent.” Kira did not put the 
guitar away either, but spent 
some time every “evening” giv- 
ing Helva additional samples 
of Dylanist wit and social pene- 
tration, from the ancient dream 
songs of the Protest Decade in 
early. Atomic history to exam- 
ples of contemporary protests. 

When the call from Ahoth 
came, it interrupted Kira’s mas- 
terful rendition of a very ear- 
ly Dylan, “Blowin’ in the 
Wind.” 

Kira laid aside her guitar 

97 



carefully and answered the call, 
her face registering polite sur- 
prise at the origin. 

“Fifteen thousand?” she re- 
peated for confirmation and re- 
ceived what Helva felt was an 
unnecessarily curt rejoinder and 
cut off. 

While Kira had been dealing 
with the call, Helva had acti- 
vated the ship’s memory files 
for facts on the planet. 

“That’s odd,” she remarked. 
“How so?” asked Kira, jot- 
ting down eta computations. 

“There’s no record of their 
having a bank. Grim planet. In 
a highly unstable volcanic per- 
iod. Use a lot of molten mining 
techniques. Highest mortality 
rate in the Central Worlds.” 

“I think,” commented Kira 
dryly, “you’d better see what 
Cencom has to say about our 
landing there.” 

“It’s not on the restricted list, 
Kira,” Helva replied, but she 
activated the tight beam. 

“Alioth?” Cencom exclaim- 
ed, surprised out of its formal 
voice. “The mayday didn’t go 
out to them as we have no 
record of a bank there. Ethnical- 
ly speaking it’s possible. Hold.” 
Kira cocked an eyebrow at 
Helva. “They’re checking with 
I know who. Two gets you one 
they abort the call.” 

“Two gets me one of what?” 
jibed Helva. 

98 



“KH,” Cencom returned. 
“Proceed to Alioth. No bank 
listed, but traders report im- 
provements in mining techniques 
indicate technological advances 
at proper level for race propa- 
gation. Religious hierarchy pow- 
erful, so do not antagonize. Re- 
peat, do not antagonize. And re- 
port soonest.” 

“You just lost two whatever 
it was you bet,” Helva taunted. 

“Okay,” Kira said with a 
shrug. “Filmbank have any 
clips?” 

T Telva flashed them on the 
-^viewer. The first were as- 
pects of the small spaceport. 
The main city was dominated 
by an enormous temple against 
the side of an extinct volcano: 
the broad multiple steps lead- 
ing to it reminding Helva of 
a ziggurat. She didn’t much 
care for worlds with a religious 
hierarchy, but she appreciated 
the fact that her opinion was 
at the moment jaundiced. Too 
many religions were gloom and 
doom. Alioth, fourth planet of 
its solar system, was far enough 
out from its primary to get 
little of its brightness, and its 
volcanic era predisposed it to 
Dantean excesses. 

One last scene showed a pro- 
cession of torch-bearing, cowled 
figures crossing a huge central 
plaza in front of the temple. 

GALAXY 



“A truly cheerless place,” 
Kira commented, making a face. 
“Well, with only fifteen thou- 
sand, we won’t have to stay 
long.” She strummed a gay time 
to counteract the morbid pic- 
tures. 

“They are in the ethnic group 
required by Nekkar,” Helva re- 
marked dubiously. 

“Can’t ■ see a thing with all 
those hoods,” Kira said. “You 
don’t suppose the embryos 
come complete with cowl, do 
you? Thafd be a facer for the 
Nekkarese,” she giggled, add- 
ing a guitar laugh. 

“You should say, born with 
a caul.” 

Kira threatened Helva with 
the guitar, then made her in- 
spection of the three holds. 

“This extra fifteen thousand 
will crowd us a little with the 
20,000 at Merak,” Kira mused 
as she worked. 

“Alioth is spatially alligned 
with Nekkar. We can make it 
there with time to spare. Then, 
hoiyotoho off on another stork 
run.” 

Kira straightened, wrinkling 
her nose in Helva’s direction. 

“Hoiyotoho is utterly inap- 
propriate to a stork run.” 

“For you, maybe, but not for 
me. I am, after all, an armored 
maid.” 

“Ha!” Kira barked, and she 
fell silent as she peered through 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



a magnifying lens at a joint. 

When the two had finished 
the inspection, Kira paused at 
the galley, reaching absently for 
coffee. She wandered, moody 
for the first time in nearly a 
week, into the main cabin and 
plunked herself down on the 
pilot’s chair, curling her feet un- 
der her and sitting quietly, only 
the curling vapor of the heat- 
ing coffee moving. 

“Stork run!” she said final- 
ly. “D’you realize, Helva, I’m 
the same ethnic group, too? 
Those pieces of life are the 
children of people like me. Only 
unlike me. Because they have 
left seed, and I have none.” 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” Helva 
snapped, hoping to ward off a 
Kiran explosion. “You fulfilled 
your RCA duty when you 
reached your majority, didn’t 
you?” 

“No,” Kira laughed back. 
“No, I didn’t. I had met Thorn 
by then, and I was going to 
have all my children. I didn’t 
need any agency to insure the 
propagation of those chromo- 
somes that are essentially Kira 
Falernova Mirsky of Cano- 
pus. As a matter of fact,” she 
said sardonically, “I even wrote 
a Dylan On the RCA, full of 
wit and drollery, with candid 
cracks about the uncanned 
child.” 

She swung the chair around 

99 



to face Helva, her eyes nar- 
rowed in self-contempt. 

“One of the many items my 
so-censored biograph left out 
was that my only child died 
a -homing, from his mother’s 
womb untimely ripped, ripping 
it and rendering her complete- 
ly barren.” 

Kira spanned her tiny hips 
with slender hands. “No life 
in these loins, ever . not im- 
planted nor impregnated. No 
nothing of Thorn or all we had 
together. That,” and she snap- 
ped her finger, “for our su- 
preme egotistical self-assurance.” 

It was for such accidents that 
the RCA recommended seed do- 
nations from every young adult. 
It was pointless to remind Kira 
of this. She was all too patent- 
ly aware of her folly. 

“That’s why I returned to 
medicine after Thorn’s death 
rather than to the Service. But 
all my studies proved that there 
was no rebirth in me nor birth 
for me. Science can do many 
wonders, make many adjust- 
ments, but not that.” 

She sighed heavily, but her 
bitterness was not as frantic as 
that first explosion. Helva won- 
dered if Kira had resigned her- 
self to barrenness as ^e had 
not, from appearances, resigned 
herself to living. 

“Which is why, dear Helva, 
it is ironic for me, of all people, 
100 



to be assisting this particular 
cargo around the Great Wheel.” 

Helva refrained from any re- 
marks. Kira finished her coffee 
and retired to rest. Within a few 
hours, there would be Merak to 
deal with, then on to Alioth. 

VI 

'"T^hey cleared Merak in record 
time, the technicians being 
both quick and careful. Alioth 
was only a few days onward 
before the last hop to Nekkar. 
Scout and ship had now achiev- 
ed a pleasant routine in which 
Helva filled gaps in her classi- 
cal and ancient musical reper- 
toire with Kira’s^ comprehensive 
acquaintance with folk music 
from old Terra and the early 
colonial periods of the now ma- 
jor worlds. 

Helva woke Kira just before 
touchdown on Alioth. The scout 
dressed quickly in a somber 
tunic, braiding her hair so close- 
ly to her scalp Helva wonder- 
ed her head didn’t ache. 

Touchdown was not auspi- 
cious. To begin with, the space- 
port was overshadowed by the 
jagged, glowing peaks of Alioth’s 
active continental spine. They 
were told to touch down some 
distance from the small rec- 
tangular building that housed 
what control and administration 
the unhospitable planet requir- 

GALAXY 



ed. Kira protested they were 
too far from the building to 
effect a quick transfer and was 
brusquely informed she was to 
await the arrival of a ground 
vehicle. It took its time in ar- 
riving, a huge transport truck 
loaded with cowled figures 
which took positions around 
Helva’s base, elbow to elbow. 
Their attitude was suspiciously 
belligerent, their presence an in- 
sult to a ship bearing Helva’s 
markings. 

“What is the meaning of 
mounting a guard on a scout 
ship in Central Worlds Medical 
Service?” Kira demanded in firm 
tones of control tower. 

“For the protection of your 
cargo.” 

At this moment, the charge 
officer of the guard contingent 
requested permission to enter 
tlic scout ship. 

“Well?” Helva asked softly 
of Kira. 

“I don’t see we have much 
choice, but I suggest you tape 
this audio and visual and en- 
code it back to Regulus.” 

“My thought, too,” Helva 
agreed thoughtfully. “I think 
I’ll play silent.” 

“A good idea,” Kira admit- 
ted, adjusting a contact but- 
ton on her cloak. 

There were many backward 
planets, where the partnership 
of the mobile “brawn” scout and 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



his “brain” ship was improperly 
understood. On such worlds it 
often had been to the advan- 
tage of the partners to keep the 
“brain’s” abilities unknown un- 
til needed, if needed. The but- 
ton would allow Helva , to keep 
in sight and sound contact with 
Kira. 

The officer, an ominous, tall 
figure in its black cowl, ap- 
peared at the airlock which Hel- 
va opened. The man, his face 
unseen, towered above Kira. A 
thin hand was extruded from 
the draperies and made a ges- 
ture towards breast and hid- 
den face that could be inter- 
preted as a salute of sorl^. 

Kira responded in kind, wait- 
ing for him to speak first. 

“Second Watch Officer Non- 
eth,” he finally intoned. 

“Medical Scout Kira of Can- 
opus,” Kira replied with dig- 
nity. Helva did not fail to note 
that the girl clung to her plane- 
tary designation rather than a 
ship-partner identity as KH-834. 

“Your presence is required at 
High Temple to discuss the do- 
nation,” Noneth said in hollow, 
measured tones. 

“Time is of the essence in a 
transfer of this nature,” Kira 
began smoothly. 

“Time,” intoned the officer, 
“is at the disposal of Him Who 
Orders. It is at his command 
you are to come.” 



101 




“The seed is ready for ship- 
ment?” Kira asked, insistent on 
some information. 

A shudder rippled the fabric 
surrounding the figure on Non- 
eth. 

“Do not blaspheme.” 

“Unintentional, I assure you,” 
Kira said, calmly refusing to 
offer further apology. 

“Come,” ordered the officer 
in a voice of command that 
crackled with authority. 

“He Who Orders bids you 
come, woman,” a sepulchral, 
harsh voice echoed shrilly 
through the tiny cabin. 

ira won another mark of 
respect from Helva, when 
she gave no indication of sur- 
prise at that awesome bellow. 
The scout’s eyes flicked brief- 
ly over the smooth, oval fasten- 
ing on Noneth’s hood. Helva as 
well as Kira recognized the de- 
vice for what it was, a two- 
way control similar to the one 
Kira wore — a type issued only 
through the Scout Service. 

There’d be a nova of a scan- 
dal when Central Worlds dis- 
covered who was distributing 
these restricted designs on back- 
ward planets. 

“The order must be obeyed. 
The Temple itself has spoken,” 
Noneth cried in a voice quaver- 
ing with reverance. “Dally not.”

102 



The Temple was feminine, 
Helva realized, having apprais- 
ed the timbre of the voice. 

“I am under orders,” Kira be- 
gan evasively. 

“That is the Eternal Truth.” 
Noneth replied, nodding as Kira 
apparently responded in a man- 
ner consonant with solemn ac- 
cord, his religion. He raised his 
hand in a stylized gesture and 
added, “May Death come to you 
at the moment of your tri- 
umph.” 

Kira, about to make a grace- 
ful obeisance, halted and star- 
ed up at the hidden face, her 
eyes wide with shock. 

“May Death come to you at 
the moment of your triumph?” 
she murmured. The blood drain- 
ed from her face. 

“Is not Death the greatest of 
blessings?” asked the priest, 
mildly surprised at her ignor- 
ance. 

It was all Helva could do 
to remain silent, but a deep 
instinct stifled her half-formed 
groan of protest. It took little 
extra interpolation to surmise 
that Death on Alioth would be 
the greatest of blessings: relief 
from the terrible drudgery, the 
grim and gloomy aspect of the 
planet with its hovering smok- 
ing mountains. The normal per- 
ils of molten mining plus the 
daily anxiety of a volcano 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



emerging and erupting under- 
foot had emphasized the brevi- 
ty of existence until the emiAa- 
sis had swung towards Death as 
a welcome respite from grinding 
toil and miserable conditions. 
Was Cencom out of its alleged 
mind, when it did not ban Kira 
from landing on Alioth, know- 
ing her compulsion? She 
wouldn’t even have to strain 
against her conditioning. 

“Yes, Death is the greatest of 
blessings. That is Eternal 
Truth,” Kira repeated, trance- 
like. 

“Come with me,” Noneth en- 
joined, gently persuasive, his 
gaunt hand beckoning to Kira. 
“Come,” echoed the sepuchral 
voice greedily. 

The ground car had no soon- 
er left the base of the KH-834 
than the guard began to move. 

“She will see Him Who Or- 
ders,” one sighed enviously. 
“The bare-faced harlot will be 
given an unjust Reward. Now! 
Up the lift and let us secure the 
cargo. Think of it! Thousands 
more to die to expiate the sin 
against Him Who Orders.” 

''T^hat was sufficient for Helva. 

She locked the lift controls 
and slid the airlock securely 
tight. Curse, hammer, buffet 
though those Aliothites might, 
Helva was invulnerable against 

103 



such weapons as Alioth’s tech- 
nology possessed. She activated 
the tight beam to Cencom. Ali- 
oth would rue the day its reli- 
gious hierarchy decided to hi- 
jack the cargo of a Service Ship. 
Much less kidnap its scout. 

Dispassionately Helva took 
account of the matter of Kira’s 
departure. The girl had, in the 
extremes of grief, sought death. 
But Helva doubted Kira would 
betray her service. For one thing, 
she couldn’t, although the Ali- 
othites didn’t realize the ship 
was capable of independent 
thought and action. Having en- 
ticed the scout away, they as- 
sumed the ship was grounded, 
impotent, and they could take 
their time forcing the scout to 
accede to their designs on the 
embryos. 

I could just leave, Helva 
thought. If Death is the reward 
these zealots seek, then I have 
no compunctions about burn- 
ing the guard detail to its due 
merits. But I cannot leave this 
“brawn”. Not yet. I have time. 
What was the matter with Cen- 
com? They were never around 
when you needed them! And 
why in the name of little apples 
did they permit Kira to land 
on a death-dedicated planet? 
You idiot, Helva told herself, 
because they didn’t know that’s 
the way the religion turned. 

The ground rumbled beneath 
104 



her. Far to the north a fire- 
ball zoomed heavenward, burst- 
ing in a shower of lighted frag- 
ments. Other fireworks follow- 
ed as well as more ominous 
movement beneath Helva’s tail- 
fins. She held herself ready for 
an instant lift-off if her balance 
was shaken beyond normal re- 
covery in her stabilizers. Some- 
where to the northeast, another 
volcano answered the first. 

Helva saw the ground car car- 
rying Kira reach the central 
building, and she muttered, in- 
effective mental commands for 
Kira to snap out of her trance 
and switch on the contact but- 
ton. 

The guard, impervious to the 
massed eruptions, kept right on 
trying to force the lift mechan- 
ism. Their cowls kept falling 
from their faces, and they kept 
replacing them as if a bareface 
were indecent. The red light 
from the fireballs which con- 
tinued to light the sky illum- 
inated gaunt, ascetic faces, dir- 
ty with ingrained volcanic dusts, 
dull-eyed from improper nutri- 
tion and continual fatigue. 

Kira alighted from the trans- 
port and, flanked by guards, 
was escorted to a smaller vehi- 
cle which disappeared from Hel- 
va’s augmented vision into the 
complex of city buildings. The 
transport turned back to the 
field and Helva. 



GALAXY 



One more enterprising guard 
urged his fellows to bring a 
gantry rig against the ship. This 
they did, slowly and with much 
effort, wheeling the unwieldy 
frame from a far side of the 
field. Helva watched the per- 
formance with grim amusement. 
Their own fault for insisting we 
set down so far from the facili- 
ties of the port. Perhaps they 
couldn’t see in the gloom of 
Alioth’s perpetual twilight that 
the lock was closed tight, too. 

She tried to rouse Cencom 
on the tight beam, cursing at 
the delay, furious she was un- 
able to reach Kira on the con- 
tact. 

“Contact button,” she mutter- 
ed to herself, recalling the an- 
omalous appearance of one on 
Noneth’s hood. Now, if it were 
actually either Service issue of 
an imitation, she ought to be 
able to use it. And that Temple 
female had utilized one to sec- 
ond Noneth’s commands to Kira. 

Helva wasted no time in 
throwing open the wide-wave on 
the contact band. As hastily, 
she closed it, dazed with the re- 
sultant chaotic kaleidoscope of 
sight and sound that besieged 
her unsuspecting senses. Mental- 
ly reeling from the impact, she 
wondered painfully how she had 
managed to get several hundred 
thousand contacts at once. 
Quickly she scanned the scur- 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



rying guards, still trying to wres- 
tle the gantry frame to her. 
Each one had a button securing 
his hood at the throat, 

“Great glittering galaxies,” 
moaned Helva. “That Temple 
female’s got them by the throat. 
This religion must be composed 
of schizoids to deal with that 
kind of chaos.” 

T Tolding tightly to her sanity, 
Helva opened the band a 
fraction, wincing at the con- 
fusion of sound and sight. She 
tried to focus in on one contact 
alone, but felt herself drown- 
ing in the myriad pictures that 
returned. It was like trying to 
focus on a pinpoint through the 
faceting of a fly’s eyeball. 

Grimly she diminished the 
band into one small area, forc- 
ing herself to accept only one 
of the conflicting and overlap- 
ping images that returned to her. 
She cut out the sound complete- 
ly. Fortunately every wearer in 
the selected segment was con- 
verging on one location, cross- 
ing a huge plaza, crowded with 
gyrating, swaying cowled fig- 
ures, their robes flapping around 
them as they approached the 
wide deep steps that led up the 
side of the dead volcano. This 
was the ziggurat Helva had no- 
ticed in the tape clip. 

Suddenly everything and 

105 



every figure tilted. It took Hel- 
va a moment to realize she too 
was rocking with the earthquake 
as three more volcanoes spewed 
out their guts skjrward. She 
waited, alert, lest the instability 
of the spaceport field became 
too critical for her to remain 
planetbound. 

An ecstatic, moaning roar 
wafted through the air which 
was becoming hazy as the 
earth’s minute shift released gas- 
es from narrow fissures in the 
floor of the plaza. Helva, al- 
ready confused, did not at first 
catch the significance of the gas 
or the fact that the ululation 
was reaching her ship’s outer 
ears, not issuing from the dumb 
contact circuits. 

Frantically Helva increased 
power in the tight beam, des- 
perately trying to raise Cencom 
over the volcanic interferences. 
Simultaneously she cut in the 
narrow contact, not able to risk 
losing Kira. Everyone in the 
plaza was now waving arms 
aloft, hoods thrown back from 
joyful faces raised to the spark- 
filled, gas-fogged skies. Then 
the Aliqthites wheeled, ducking 
their heads to breathe deeply 
of the rising gas fumes. Incre- 
dulous Helva watched as more 
and more people pushed and 
crowded around the fissures, in- 
haling deeply, staggering away, 
106 



faces rapt, arms aloft, move- 
ments erratic. Stunned, Helva 
realized that the gases were 
either hallucinogenic or euphor- 
ic, deadly dangerous as senses 
were dulled to the perils of 
wandering in the open iduring 
mass volcanic eruptions. Yet the 
exposed plaza was rapidly fill- 
ing with bodies either already 
intoxicated or frantically trying 
to achieve it. 

The significance of gas erup- 
tions in the plaza before the 
Temple of this demoniac reli- 
gion was not lost on Helva. 
This effect was known and cal- 
culated by the temple hierar- 
chy. Helva was revolted and 
enraged by such a depraved 
government, and she redoubled 
her efforts to locate Kira and 
her escort. They would have to 
leave the vehicle and enter the 
plaza on the south side. One 
multiexposed group caught her 
searching eyes. There couldn’t 
be two such slender, hoodless 
figures on this mad planet. Kira 
was just entering the plaza, her 
inexorable progress towards the 
ziggurat steps impeded by the 
jerking, jolting freak-inebriates. 

Frenzied, Helva widened the 
band, trying to skip from con- 
tact to contact, forward towards 
Kira. The effect was madden- 
ing, like seeing thousands of 
film tapes all interlocking fuzzi- 

GALAXY 



ly, playing on the same master 
screen. For the first time in her 
life, Helva felt vertigo and nau- 
sea of the mind .Her sense of 
impending disaster deepened as 
she tried to reach Kira before 
she entered the Temple of 
Death. Placed as it was on top 
of the massive ziggurat, right 
ne.xt to the old volcano, it must 
be heavy with hallucinogenic 
gases. Helva thanked the Ser- 
vice for the small blessing that 
Kira had been desensitized to 
such hazards as hallucinogens, 
but she was as immobile in her 
trance as if she were susceptible. 

VII 

T T elva groaned at her inability 
to reach Kira, spiritually or 
I)hysically. 

“Ooooh,” an answering groan 
rose from the multitude. “The 
Temple weeps,” the cry went 
up, garbled from a thousand 
throats. Even the guards at the 
spaceport, wrestling with the 
gantry frame, echoed the .chant. 

“Oh,” Helva gasped, and her 
surmise that she was broadcast- 
ing to all Aliothites was con- 
firmed, as her exclamation was 
n (1 1)3^ the crowd. She had 
hec'n mistaken for the voice of 
their Temple female. 

Oblivious to the multivision, 
Helva stared at the cylindrical 
lop of the Temple and recog- 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



nized what she had not con- 
sciously identified before. The 
cylinder was a ship on its long 
axis, nose and fins buried in 
the lava of the old eruption. 
The Temple entrance was noth- 
ing more than an airlock, and by 
that entrance, Helva could 
trace the faintly visible designa- 
tion of a Central Worlds brain 
ship. 

As clear as the day she had 
heard it, the day Jennan had 
died, Helva recalled what Sil- 
via, the 422, had told her about 
another grief-stricken ship. The 
732 had turned rogue after the 
death of her scout on the metal- 
heavy planet of a white dwarf. 
Where better to hide than a 
red-dark violent world, so con- 
ducive to the immolation of 
grief? Or had the 732, aimed 
at the fiery maw of the erupt- 
ing volcano, somehow been de- 
flected from the seething cone 
at the last moment to be lodged 
immovably in the lava flow at 
its base? Had the 732 turned 
her tortured mind on the grim 
world and urged thousands to 
die in expiation for the death 
of its beloved? 

The requirements of her duty 
were suddenly lucid to Helva, 
and the plans to discharge it 
sprang to mind. Unconsciously 
and with the genius of sheer 
desperation, Helva began to 
sing, her voice a deep caressing 

107 



baritone, coloring her resonances 
with minor-keyed longing, sus- 
pending reason to the dictates of 
sheer instinct. 

Death is mine, mine for- 
ever. 

She intoned, repeating the 
phrase a third above, as the re- 
sponsive Aliothites chanted the 
first phrase in obedient mimicry. 
It was like having an incredibly 
well-rehearsed world-chorus at 
your disposal. Helva immediate- 
ly exploited the phenomenon 
ruthlessly : 

Sleep 1 cannot, rest eludes 
me. 

And down a fifth: 

Dreams to plague me, 
tortured I. 

Up to an augmented seventh as 
the chorus chimed in on a dis- 
sonance, calculated to raise in- 
ner hackles and pierce the gut 
with longing: 

Let me sleep, let me rest, 
let me die. 

Helva sang, her voice sliding 
into the edged timbre of a 
harsh yearning tenor. 

Down again to the original 
musical phrase, but this time the 
baritone quality was tinged with 
scorn : 

Death is mine, mine for- 
ever. 

Let me sleep, let me rest, 
let me die. 

The last word became a vibrant 
crescendo of derision, diminish- 
108 



ing to a mocking whisper, long 
after the supporting chorus had 
completed its cry on the aug- 
mented seventh. 

4C/^encom calling KH-834, 
will you acknowledge? 
ACKNOWLEDGE?” the hard, 
official voice of Regulus Base 
Cencom broke through Helva’s 
fantastic musical improvisation. 

“Mayday, mayday,” Helva 
replied in a jolting soprano on 
both tight beam and the Alio- 
thite contact band. The chorus 
obediently shrilled out the re- 
sounding emergency challenge. 
Helva caught her breath, as she 
saw Kira stagger with instinctive 
reaction to the cry. 

“Mayday?” Cencom blasted 
back. “Who the hell is Dylan- 
izing on Alioth?” 

With a shock, Helva realized 
that was exactly what she was 
doing, Dylanizing. Her appeal 
to Kira, though couched music- 
ally — music being the one me- 
dium she subconsciously hoped 
would reach the entranced scout 
— had crystallized further into 
the subliminal form of a Dylan- 
esque protest. Exultant, she 
knew how to manipulate this to 
her own ends. With a barely 
perceptible increase in tempo, 
she repeated her first phrase, 
no longer a longing legato, but 
a mocking staccato. As the 
chorus responded idiotically true 

GALAXY 



to its model, she hurriedly re- 
ported to Cencom. 

“Alioth’s religious head is the 
rogue ship 732; the religious mo- 
tivation is deatii!” 

“The scout, where is your 
scout?” Cencom crackled back 
as near panic as it would ever 
come. 

“What is the release word for 
the 732?” Helva hissed, then 
chanted the second phrase for 
her Dylan, again packing Up the 
tempo so that the beat as well 
as the sound had urgency to 
it. 

“Why are you Dylanizing? 
Report!” Cencom demanded, 
outraged. 

“Don’t bother me. The re- 
lease word!” Helva snarled. She 
jumped her voice an octave and 
a half, switching registers to 
, heldcntenor, her phrase ring- 
ing through the plaza in an 
arrow of sheer emotion-packed 
sound to pierce the trance of 
her scout. 

Kira’s guard was lurching 
now, half-dazed by the treach- 
erous fumes that filled the pla- 
za. They had Kira by the arms, 
and Helva trapped in the back- 
ground of the mighty chorus, 
couldn’t tell whether they were 
restraining Kira or hanging on- 
to her for support. She alone 
was unaffected by the hallucin- 
ogen. 

“Let me sleep, let me rest, 

THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



let me die!” Helva’s tenor rang, 
scornfully, lashing viciously at 
Kira’s deathwish. 

“You fool,” Cencom mouthed 
in sheer rage, “don’t say that! 
She wants to die!” 

“GIVE ME THE RELEASE 
WORD!” Helva screamed at 
the tight beam in a strident 
soprano. Then projected her 
voice, bitterly powerful, angri- 
ly compelling, thundering the 
protest. 

“Let me sleep, let me rest, 
let me die!” The phrase echoed 
tauntingly through the plaza. 
The chorus, unable to imitate 
the incredible pitch of Helva’s 
voice, dropped to the lower oc- 
tave. The challenge rocked back 
across the plaza, punctuated by 
the massive thunder of erupting 
volcanoes. 

With a sudden, soundless, 
soul-shattering wrench, the 
massed glimpses of chaos dis- 
solved, and Helva was suddenly 
of single sight, in a darkly cur- 
tained chamber, unevenly lit by 
red braziers. Increasing her dark 
vision, Helva penetrated the 
gloom, her attention focused on 
the hideous object that domin- 
ated the room. 

VHI 

/^n a raised, black basaltic 
slab lay the decomposi®g 
remains of what had once been 

109 



a man. Its teeth were bared 
whitely through the decayed 
flesh in a travesty of a smile. 
The tendons of his neck were 
stark ridges, and the cartilage 
of his isophagus ended in the 
indestructible fabric of a scout 
coverall. His bands, crossed on 
the chest cavity, crumpled by 
a massive fatal blow, were link- 
ed by the intertwined post-mor- 
tal growth of fingernails. This, 
Helva knew, was the 732’s dead 
“brawn”. 

And Helva was watching 
through Kira’s contact button. 

A wailing chant filled the 
chamber, a meaningless mourn- 
ful dribble of sound, emanating 
from the walls, the ceiling, the 
floor. The mad “brain”, still en- 
cased in its indestructible titan- 
ium shell, had all circuits open, 
keening, oblivious to everything. 

In as soundless a whisper as 
she could broadcast, Helva mut- 
terel swiftly to Kira. “It’s the 
rogue 732. It’s gone mad. It’s 
got to be destroyed.” It was 
easier somehow for Helva, 
knowing what she must do, to 
think of the 732 as an imper- 
sonal “it,” rather than the fe- 
male' the “brain” once was. 

Kira swayed, making no re- 
ply. 

For one paralyzing demi- 
second, Helva wondered if the 
girl had inadvertently opened 
the contact, if Kira were still 

no 



in the thrall of the powerful 
deathwish. Had Helva’s Dylan 
protest pierced Kira’s self-des- 
tructive trance with its mock- 
ery? Had Helva succeeded in 
jolting her “brawn” to sanity? 
The release word would be no 
mortal use if she did not have 
her mobile “brawn’s” coopera- 
tion to immobolize the rogue. 

With slow steps Kira ap- 
proached the bier and its ghast- 
ly occupant. The keening grew 
louder, the mumbling became 
articulated. 

“He has been taken. He Who 
Orders has been taken,” chant- 
ed the 732, and the crowd 
echoed the chant as readily as 
they had Helva’s. “He is gone. 
Seber is gone.” 

Again, not again, helpless! 
Helva cried, her mind over- 
whelmed by her hopelessness. 

Eerily another sound was 
superimposed over the 732’s 
wail. 

“Now that dwarf presents a 
definite problem, Lia,” the wow- 
ing, muffled words could bare- 
ly be distinguished. “I wouldn’t 
be surprised . ” 

It was a man’s voice, Helva 
realized, played back at a lag- 
ging speed which distorted the 
words into a yawing parody. 
The ship was broadcasting, had 
broadcasted this tape so often 
until Seber’s tapped voice was as 
decayed as his corpse. 



GALAXY 



Kira continued to sway in her 
graceful circumnavigation. 

“Speak, oh Seber, in singing 
tones that they servant, Kira, 
may hear the music of thy be- 
loved voice,” Kira crooned, 
making an obeisance to the col- 
umn behind which lay the shell 
of the mad 732. 

T T elva managed with super- 
human effort to suppress 
the cry of intolerable relief at 
the cues Kira was feeding her. 

“CENCOM, THE RELEASE 
WORD!” Helva pleaded on the 
tight beam just as the 732’s 
crooning broke off abruptly. 
Helva could almost feel the 
ship’s held breath. 

Delay! Delay! Where was 
Cencom ! 

“Lia, the interference on my 
contact is incredible. Can’t you 
clear up the relays? That dwarf 
is wreaking havoc ...” 

Even Kira jumped involun- 
tarily as Helva, deepening her 
voice to a baritone approxima- 
tion of Seber’s, adlibbed franti- 
cally. 

“Can’t seem to read you 
clearly. Lia? Lia? You got wires 
crossed?” 

“Seber? Seber?” shrieked the 
rogue ship, her voice wild with 
incredulous hope. “I’m trapped. 
I’m trapped. I was thrown off 
course when the edge of the 
volcano blew. I tried to die.” 
THE SHIP WHO KILLED 



Kira was fumbling with the 
draperies at the bulkhead. Her 
escorts, roused from their euph- 
oria as they sensed sacrilege, 
dove towards Kira. Her swift 
hand caught one on the voice 
box in a deadly hhop. She duck- 
ed under the other man, using 
her body to throw him against 
the bier so squarely that his 
head cracked ominously against 
the stone, and he slumped down. 

“KH, the release is na-thom- 
te-ah-ro, watch the pitch!” 

And Helva, knowing she was 
in effect executing one of her 
own kind, broadcast the release 
word into the 732. As the sylla- 
bles with their pitched nuances

activated the release of the ac- 
cess panel, Kira caught the 
plate, reached in deftly and 
threw th,e valve that would flood 
the inside of the shell with an- 
aesthesia. 

“I can’t see you, Seber. Where 
are . and the 732’s despair- 
ing wail was stilled in longed- 
for death. 

Kira whirled, the panel clink- 
ing behind the concealing drap- 
eries as cowled figures lurched 
into the main cabin from the 
quarters behind. 

“Hold!” Helva commanded in 
Lia’s voice. “He Who Orders 
has decided. Take the bare- 
faced woman back to the ship. 
Such blasphemous seed is not 
for the chosen of Alioth.” 

Kira, again trancelike, fol- 
lowed the dazed hoods back 
down the steps. 

“Helva, what in hell’s name is 
happening there?” Cencom de- 
manded within the 834. 

“He has decided,” the fana- 
tical mob in the plaza groaned 
and swayed in the thrall of the 
hallucinogenic fumes. 

“Helva!” snapped Cencom. 

“Oh shut up all of you,” 
snapped Helva, schizoidically. 
“He has ordered. That is Eter- 
nal Truth.” 

She watched just long enough 
to be sure that the reeling, 
freak-drunk Aliothites would not 
interfere with Kira’s return. 
112 



How they could, Helva couldn’t 
imagine, for they were dropping 
by the hundreds, exhausted by 
fumes and frenzy, 

“I demand to know why you 
have deliberately abbrogated 
specific restrictions in your 
journey tape regarding Dylan- 
istic . ” 

“Demand be Dylanized,” Hel- 
va cut them off angrily. “The 
end justifies the means, and 
might I remind you that for 
some reason unknown forever 
to God and man, your list of 
restricted planets did NOT in- 
clude Alioth as by the finger- 
nails of that- God they should 
have!” 

Cencom sputtered indignant- 
ly. 

“Control yourself,” Helva sug- 
gested acidly. “I found your 
long-lost rogue, and I have 
killed her. And I have touched 
on the release therapy for your 
precious Kira of Canopus. What 
more do you want of one 
“brain” shell? Huh?” 

Cencom maintained silence 
for sixty stunned seconds. 

“Where is Kira?” 

Helva could swear Cencom 
sounded contrite. “She’s all 
right,” Helva muttered. 

“Put her on.” 

“She’s all right!” Helva re- 
peated with weary emphasis. 
“She’s on her way back from 
the Temple.” 



GALAXY 



The spaceport rocked under 
a multiple eruption north of the 
city just as the vehicle bear- 
ing Kira screeched to a halt at 
the lift. Helva unlocked the 
mechanism, and Kira lept on 
before the guards came to their 
senses. The ground danced un- 
der the ship’s stabilizers, and as 
Kira dove from airlock to pi- 
lot’s couch, Helva slammed the 
lock shut and precipitiously lift- 
ed from grim Alioth.

I n the tail scanners they saw 
the guards retreating to safe- 
ty as the gantry tumbled leis- 
urely down. Bright jewels dot- 
ted the receding planet as it 
gave them a volcanic sendoff. 

“Scout Kira of the KH-834 
reporting,” the slender girl said 
crisply to Cencom, shedding the 
cloak. Helva half-expected a 
shower of hairpins to follow but 
Kira remained tautly erect be- 
fore the tight beam. She gave a 
terse report, demanding to know 
why traders had not reported the 
])resencc of Service-type con- 
tact buttons plainly visible on 
every Aliothite. And why, which 
was a far more criminal omis- 
sion, the hallucinogenic gas 
eruptions had not been report- 
ed. 

“Hallucinogenic gas?” Cen- 
corn echoed weakly. Such in-

stances v/ere the nightmares of 
colonization, as entire popula- 
tions could be subjected to ille- 
gal domination by such emis- 
sions, as indeed had happened 
on Alioth. 

“I recommended strongly that 
all traders dealing with Alioth 
in the last fifty years be ques- 
tioned as to their motives in 
suppressing such information 
from Central Worlds. And dis- 
cover who was the semi-intelli- 
gent CW representative who 
cleared this freak-off planet for 
colonization.” 

Cencom was reduced to in- 
coherent sputters. 

“Stop gargling,” Kira suggest- 
ed sweetly, “and order an all- 
haste planet therapy team here. 
You’ve got an entire society to 
reorient to the business of liv- 
ing. We’ll file a comprehensive 
report from Nekkar, but now 
I’ve got to inspect our chil- 
dren. That was a rough take- 
off. Over and out.” And Kira 
closed the tight beam down. 

With a fluid motion she pro- 
pelled herself to the kitchen, 
shaking her braids free and mas- 
saging her scalp with rough fin- 
gers. 

“My head is pounding!” she 
exclaimed, reaching for coffee. 
“That gas was unbelievably 
malodorous.” She leaned wear- 
ily against the counter, her 
shoulders sagging in fatigue.

Helva waited, knowing Kira 
was sorting her thoughts. 

“The closer I got to that tem- 
ple, the deeper the terrible 
miasma of grief. It was almost 
visible, Helva,” she said and 
then added scathingly, “and I 
wallowed in it. Until that Dy- 
lan of yours reached me, Hel- 
va.” Her eyes widened respect- 
fully. “The hair on the back 
of my neck stood up straight. 
That final chord got me, right 
here,” she groaned, jabbing at 
her abdomen with a graphic 
fist. “Thom would have given 
strings from his guts to com- 
pose such a powerful Dylan.” 
Her shoulders jerked in a 
violent muscle spasm. “That 
awful corpse!” She closed her 
eyes and shuddered, shaking her 
head sharply to rid herself of 
the effect. “I think ...” she 
murmured, her eyes narrowing 
with self -appraisal, “I think I 
had done the same thing to 
Thom.” 

“I think perhaps you had,” 
Helva agreed softly. 

Kira sipped at her coffee, her 
face tired but alive, the mask 
of vivacity replaced by an inner 
calm. “I have been so stupid,” 
she said with trenchant self- 
contempt. 

“Not even Cencom is infal- 
lible,” Helva drawled. 

Kira threw back her head in 
a whoop of laughter. 

114 



“That’s Eternal Truth!” she 
crowed, dancing back into the 
main cabin. 

TTelva watched this victory 
dance, immeasurably pleas- 
ed with the outcome of the af- 
fair as far as Kira was con- 
cerned. She could not regret 
that she had had to kill one of 
her own peers. The Lia had died 
years before with her scout: that 
tortured remnant had peace at 
last, and so had Kira. She and 
Helva would continue together 
on their stork run, picking up 
the seeds from .... 

Helva let out a yip of exul- 
tation, utterly astonished at the 
solution that had risen from 
her subconscious. Kira stared at 
her, startled. 

“What hit you?” 

“It’s so ridiculously simple I 
can’t imagine someone never 
suggested it to you. Or maybe 
they did, and you rejected it.” 
“I’ll never know unless you 
tell me what it is,” Kira re- 
plied caustically. 

“One of the facets of your 
grief psychosis ...” 

“I’m over it now,” Kira in- 
terrupted Helva, eyes flashing 
angrily. 

“ . Ha to that. One of the 
facets has been the lack of 
progeny from your seed and 
Thorn’s? Right?” 

The scout’s face turned stark-

!y white, but Helva plunged on. 

“Neither set of your parents 
was stupid enough to have ig- 
nored their RCA duty. Right? 
So their seed is on file. Take 
some of your mother’s and his 
father’s and ...” 

Kira’s eyes widened, and her 
jaw dropped, her face lighting 
with incredible radiance. Tears 
streamed down her cheeks. Deli- 
cately she stretched out her 
hand, touching the access panel 
softly. 

Helva was ridiculously, em- 
barassingly delighted at her ac- 
ceptance of the idea. Then Kira 
drew her breath in sharply, her 
face concerned. 

“But for you . wouldn’t 
you take your mother’s and . .” 

“No,” Helva said sharply, 
then added more gently, “that 
won’t be necessary.” She knew 
in mind and heart now that the 
resolution of grief is highly in- 
dividual: that both she and Kira 
had reached it by different 
means, just as Theoda had. 

Kira looked unaccountably 
stricken, as if she had no right 
to take the solution Helva of- 
fered if Helva did not, too. 

“After all,” the ship chuckled, 
“there aren’t many women,” 
and Helva used the word proud-

BY WILLY LEY 

THE 

DELAYED DISCDVERY 



I f you have a bit of a radium 
compound and a sample of a 
beryllium compound in a glass 
tube something very interesting 
takes place, even though it can- 
not be seen directly. We now 
know that the disintegrating ra- 
dium atoms disgorge alpha par- 
ticles which, in turn, knock neu- 



116 



trons out of the beryllium atoms. 
Such a radium-beryllium tube, 
therefore, becomes a source of 
neutrons. 

The discovery that a mixture 
of radium and beryllium com- 
pounds emits a peculiar kind of 
“radiation” was made by several 
researchers in 1929 or 1930. They 
all noticed that the “radiation” 
was capable of pushing protons 
out of substances rich in hydro- 
gen, such as paraffin. But at first 
they could not explain just what 
was going on. The one who did 
explain it — thereby becoming 
the discoverer of the neutron 
that had not been known to exist 
— was Sir James Chadwick in 
1932. 

Two years later Enrico Fermi 
and his co-workers in Italy be- 
gan to use such radium-beryllium 
tubes to irradiate all kinds of ele- 
ments with neutrons to see what 
would happen. When they got to 
uranium they observed peculiar 
effects that seemed to indicate 
the presence of radioactive atoms 
with an atomic weight higher 
than that of uranium, the heav- 
iest element then known. The 
news that “trans-uranian” ele- 
ments had been created, excited 
the “radioactive group”, as they 
called themselves, the team of 
Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner and 
Fritz Strassmann at the Kaiser 
Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry 
in Berlin. 

FOR YOUR INFOR/MTION 



They, too, began to irradiate 
uranium and thorium with neu- 
trons from radium-beryllium 
tubes; and they, too, obtained 
“trans-uranian” elements which 
they named eka-osmium, eka- 
iridium and eka-platinum. What 
all of them had really done was 
to split the uranium atom, but 
five years had to go by until 
they realized what had really 
happened. 

Why the long delay. 

Of course Otto Hahn, who fi- 
nally did arrive at the truth, was 
the first to ask himself that 
question.* The simple answer is 
that the uranium and thorium 
atoms behaved in a manner that 
was not only completely unex- 
pected but also somewhat in- 
credible. The next question 
v/ould be why this was an un- 
expected behavior, and the an- 
swer to that one is that the whole 
history of research had never 
given the faintest indication that 
anything like that might be in 
the future. 

/^f course the whole story be-

Mendeleyev in 1868. About 63 
different chemical elements were 
known at the time, and Mende-

leyev wondered whether they 
could be classified in some man- 
ner, just as animals and plants 
had been classified. When Men- 
deleyev thought about the prob- 
lem, he did not know that this 
had been tried twice before (by 
the Frenchman Alexander Emile 
Beguyer de Chancourtois in 1862 
and by the Englishman John 
Alexander Newlands in 1864) ; 
nor did he know that the Ger- 
man Dr. Luther Meyer was en- 
gaged in the same task at the 
same time. Mendeleyev had two 
criteria 'in mind. One was the 
atomic weight, the other the 
number of valences of each ele- 
ment — that is, the number of 
other atoms an atom can hold. 

Leaving out the lightest ele- 
ment, hydrogen, Mendeleyev be- 
118 



gan with lithium that can com- 
bine with one other atom. Beryl- 
lium came next. Its atom could 
combine with two other atoms. 
Then came boron that could 
combine with three other atoms 
and after that carbon that could 
combine with four others. Going 
along that way Mendeleyev 
found a series ofl-2-3-4- 
3-2-1 valences, and the next 
set of elements repeated this se- 
ries, which is the reason why we 
still speak of a “periodic” table. 

The periods after the first two 
sets of seven each were longer 
than seven links which did not 
worry him. What was worrisome 
was that the elements, when ar- 
ranged in this manner, usually 
produced columns of elements 
with similar chemical character-

istics. Usually, that is, but not 
all the time; and in 1871 Mende- 
leyev took the daring step of dis- 
regarding atomic weight in a few 
cases and of leaving gaps in his 
table. 

These gaps, he declared, rep- 
resented elements still to be dis- 
covered; they were next to the 
known elements aluminum, bor- 
on and silicon; and Mendeleyev, 
using the Greek root eka (in the 
meaning “to the side of”), 
labelled the empty spaces eka- 
aluminum, eka-boron and eka- 
silicon. They were discovered 
quite soon. In 1875 eka-alumin- 
um became gallium, in 1879 eka-

boron became scandium and in 
1885 eka-silicon became ger- 
manium. 

After such a success in pre- 
diction nobody could doubt that 
Mendeleyev’s Periodic Table 
was valid. But while all doubts 
about the validity of the sys- 
tem were ruled out, that did not 
mean that there were no trouble 
spots. In some places things did 
not fit well, which probably 
meant undiscovered elements. 
Then there was a cluster of ele- 
ments that were collectively 
known as the “rare earth ele- 
ments” (now referred to as the 
lanthanides after their first

representative, see Table 1 as 
a memory refresher) which 
were very similar to each other 
chemically and which also up- 
set a neat and orderly arrange- 
ment no matter how one tried 
to fit them in. Finally there was 
the problem of a few new ele- 
ments in the area of the heavy- 
weights. In 1898 Marie Sklodow- 
ska-Curie had found two new 
elements, polonium with an 
atomic weight of 210 and radium 
with an atomic weight of about 
226. 

While Mme. Curie is mainly 
known for the discovery of these 
two elements, she would be near- 
ly as famous for other work, even 
if polonium and radium had been 
found by others. She proved that 
“Becquerel’s rays” (discovered 
120 



by Antoine Becquerel in 1896) 
were emitted by the uranium in 
the compounds he used and that 
thorium (discovered in 1828 by 
Jons Jacob Berzelius) also emit- 
ted radiation. Finally it was 
Mme. Curie, who coined the term 
“radioactivity”. 

'"T'he discoveries of the Curies 
' prompted a large number of 
the new generation of scientists 
to go after radioactive sub- 
stances. There was Bertram B. 
Boltwood (1870-1927) in Ameri- 
ca who discovered a new cle- 
ment called “ionium”. There 
was Friedrich Ernst Dorn in Ger- 
many (1838-1916) who showed 
in 1900 that radium did not emit 
radiation only but also a gas 
that was entered into the 

GALAXY 



Periodic Table as niton — it 
formed the bottom of the column 
of noble gases helium, neon, ar- 
gon, krypton and xenon that had 
been discovered by Sir William 
Ramsay during the last half- 
decade of the nineteenth century. 
There was Sir William Ramsay 
himself (1852-1916); there was 
Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937), 
a native of New Zealand work- 
ing in Canada and ending his life 
as Lord Rutherford of Nelson 
(after his birthplace). There was 
Hans Geiger (1882-1945), who 
worked with Rutherford and 
whose name is attached to the 
most important single instrument 
in atomic research, and there 
was Otto Hahn (born 1879), who 
worked with both Rutherford 
and Ramsay. There was, some- 
what later, Niels Bohr (1885- 
1962) of Denmark and Enrico 
Fermi (1901-1954) of Italy. 

There was, in addition to 
Ramsay, a large British contin- 
gent of which Frederick Soddy 
(1877-1956), Sir Joseph Thom- 
son (1856-1940), Henry Gwyn- 
Jeffries Moseley (1887-1915) 
and Sir James Chadwick (born 
1891) became the most famous. 

Before we go on it will be 
useful to look at Fig. 1. It shows 
a section of the Periodic Table 
as it would have looked in 1900 
if the table had then been drawn 
with the principles now known 
to be important. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Especially the bottom line is 
important. Four radioactive ele- 
ments were known: radium, 

actinium, thorium and uranium. 
It was not quite clear then what 
their order should be, and it was 
suspected that there might be 
more. 

Then Boltwood contributed 
his “ionium”. Otto Hahn began 
his career by discovering what 
he called “radio-thorium”. At a 
later date he added an element 
he called “meso-thorium,” and 
a little later he had to realize 
that he was dealing with two 
elements that were logically call- 
ed meso thorium -1 and mesothor- 
ium-2. Then he found one that 
he called uranium-X that proved 
to be quite a nuisance as far as 
experimentation wtih radioactive 
substances were concerned. In 
1907 Otto Hahn acquired an 
assistant by the name of Lise 
Meitner, the daughter of a Jew- 
ish lawyer in Vienna who found 
that academic circles in Berlin 
discriminated against her — not 
because she was Jewish, but be- 
cause she was a woman! Female 
scientists were not yet accepted, 
and the great Emil Fisdier told 
Hahn that he could have her as 
an assistant only if she promised 
to stay in their own laboratory 
and never to betray her presence 
to the (male) students of the 
university. Together they discov- 
ered Protactinium. 



121 



In the meantime still other 
“elements” had put in an ap- 
pearance: there was actinium-B 
and actinium-X, there was thor- 
ium-B, thorium-X and thorium- 
C. Rutherford began to suspect 
that atomic transformations 
seemed to be going on right un- 
der the eyes of the investigators, 
and Boltwood began to talk of 
a decay chain which probably 
ran from uranium via ionium 
and possibly thorium to radium 
and from there to lead. Of course 
this violated the fundamental 
rule of chemistry that elements 
are (a) independent and (b) un- 
changeable. Chemists who went 
after their own discoveries in 
their own fields began to make 
jokes about modern alchemists 
who tried to transmute metals,i. 
and they were openly indignant 
when Hahn and others could not 
show them “samples” of meso- 
thorium-2 or uranium-X. The 
fact that Hahn, in practically 
every publication, had to stress 
that he worked with quantities 
too small to be weighed shows 
how strange the new “radio- 
chemistry” must have looked to 
“ordinary” chemists. 

A 11 quibbling aside, the multi- 
^ tude of radioactive elements 
posed a problem. Where did they 
fit into the Periodic Table? 

Mendeleyev’s table had prov- 
ed its worth for the non-radio- 

122 



active elements. Therefore the 
radioactives had to fit into it 
somewhere. But by 1912 nearly 
fifty such substances had been 
found. Even if you cut that num- 
ber in half by assuming that 
many of them bore two different 
names because they had been 
discovered independently by dif- 
ferent researchers and assuming 
further that a few mistakes had 
been made — even two dozen 
recently discovered radioactive 
elements just could not be ac- 
commodated by the table. 

It was Frederick Soddy, in 
1913, who found the answer. 
These radioactive elements all 
differed from each other as far 
as radiation was concerned. 
Some emitted one kind of rays 
and others another kind, and 
those that emitted the same kind 
differed in intensity. But many of 
them were alike in their chemical 
characteristics, and the Periodic 
Table dealt with chemical ele- 
ments. Hence many of the radio- 
active elements belonged in the 
same place in the table. Greek 
for “same place” is eisos topos; 
the concept of isotopes had been 
born. 

And just at about the same 
time Henry Gwyn-Jeffries 
Moseley — also a Rutherford 
pupil — almost single-handedly 
revolutionized the table itself. 
He demonstrated that all ele- 
ments behaved properly under

X-ray analysis if one sorted 
them by the number of electric 
charges in their nuclei. The num- 
ber of charges — called “atomic 
number” . — was the important 
thing; the atomic weight was 
secondary. Now the table ac- 
quired the form shown in Fig. 
1. There could not possibly be 
an element between actinium 
(# 89 ) and thorium (#90) since 
one cannot have half a charge; 
but there was room for an un- 
known element between thorium 
and uranium (#92). Element 
#91 was the protactinium of 
Hahn and Meitner. 

The recognition of the exis- 
tence of isotopes and the ar- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



rangement by atomic number 
had not only saved Mendeley- 
ev’s table against the onslaught 
of the radioactives, it had great- 
ly improved it. 

Now, knowing what to look 
for, one could think a little less 
gropingly about the structure of 
the atom. Rutherford had shown 
in the meantime that the “alpha 
particle” shot out by radium was 
actually the nucleus of a helium 
atom. It was also clear that the 
so-called beta rays were actually 
electrons. Rutherford, in a lec- 
ture to chemists who still looked 
at all this with a mixture of won- 
der and helplessness, made an 
interesting comparison. When an 



123 



atom breaks down, he said, it is 
similar to firing a howitzer. The 
alpha particle is the shell; the 
smoke (still material but tenous 
by comparison) is represented 
by the electrons called beta rays; 
while the flash of light from the 
howitzer compares to the gamma 
rays which are true radiation and 
not particles. 

Now the idea of how an atom 
was constructed was this: the 
helium atom has the atomic 
number 2 which means that two 
electrons orbit the nucleus. The 
nucleus theh should consist of 
two positively charged protons. 
But the atomic weight of helium 
is 4, hence there have to be four 
protons in the nucleus. But since 
the nucleus only has two unit 
charges there must also be two 
electrons in that nucleus, neu- 
tralizing two of the four protons. 

Of course one could raise all 
kinds of questions about this. 
But these seemed to be the ob- 
served facts, and the purpose of 
a theory is to explain the ob- 
served facts, not to doubt them. 

In 1932, as has been told. Sir 
James Chadwick discovered ex- 
perimental facts which could 
only be explained by assuming 
the existence of a sub-atomic 
particle that was as massive as 
a proton but lacked an electric 
charge, a neutral particle to be 
named neutron. And Werner 
Heisenberg in Germany said im- 
124 



mediately and apparently with 
a sigh of relief, that this would 
eliminate the electrons in the 
nucleus. The alpha particle 
would simply consist of two pro- 
tons and two neutrons which 
would explain both the charge 
and the mass. In the same year 
“heavy hydrogen” (with mass 
2) was discovered, and interest 
shifted from the heaviest ele- 
ments in the table to the lightest. 

rj^ig. 2 shows how, according to 
our knowledge of today, the 
six lightest isotopes are built. 

Ordinary helium has its two 
protons and two neutrons in the 
nucleus and is a stable element. 
But there is a helium isotope, 
called tralphium, with only one 
neutron in the nucleus. This is 
an unstable isotope, of mass 3. 
Hydrogen also has an isotope of 
mass 3, called tritium, with two 
neutrons and one proton. Like 
helium of mass 3 it is unstable, 
but hydrogen of mass 2 (deuter- 
ium) and ordinary hydrogen are 
stable. 

Below ordinary hydrogen one 
more “element” has been added 
recently. Its nucleus consist of 
a “muon” (also called mu-me- 
son), and “muonium” might be 
considered an isotope of hydro- 
gen. But since a muon lasts only 
about 5 millionth of a second this 
is the shortest-lived of all the 
short-lived isotopes. 



GALAXY 



All this was necessary as back- 
ground for the answer to the 
question of why it took so long 
to recognize the fission of uran- 
ium for what it was. In 1917 
Rutherford had succeeded for 
the first time in actually trans- 
muting an element by bombard- 
ing nitrogen atoms. Some of the 
atoms were struck by alpha par- 
ticles, losing protons from their 
nuclei in the process. 

Assuming that the alpha par- 
ticle itself was absorbed by the 
nucleus, the following had taken 
place: 

7 N 14 + 2He4 , 0^7 + iHi 

or, in words: a nitrogen nucleus 
of atomic number 7 and mass 14 
had absorbed a helium nucleus 
(#2 of mass 4), forming an oxy- 
gen nucleus (#8 of mass 17) and 
a hydrogen nucleus. 

This very first successful ex- 
periment showed what could 
happen. The addition of an alpha 
particle would raise the atomic 
number of the new nucleus by 
2; the loss of an alpha particle 
would lower it by 2. Of course 
the new nucleus might be im- 
stable and shoot out a proton 
(lowering the atomic number by 
1) or else it might shoot out an 
electron (which means that one 
of the neutrons in the nucleus 
had changed into a proton) 
which would raise the atomic

number by 1. In short, all the 
changes that were observed in 
the course of time, and there 
were very many of them, chang- 
ed the atomic number by 1 or 
by 2, up or down in the table. 
If bombardment with alpha par- 
ticles, and later with neutrons, 
had produced a new element, 
the researcher would look at the 
table in both directions for 1 or 
2 numbers and then try chem- 
ical tests to see where the new- 
ly created isotope belonged. 

It was all perfectly clear. 

'■y^he new elements produced by 
the neutron bombardment 
of uranium therefore must have 
slid down two places, turning 
into isotopes of thorium, or, by 
continued decay, isotopes of ra- 
dium. Or else they had moved 
up a place or two — three at the 
very most — and filled the 
spaces above #92; #93 would 
then be eka-rhenium, #94 eka- 
osmium and #95 eka-iridium. 

Actually the uranium atom 
had broken into #56 barium and 
#36 krypton, forming several 
radioactive isotopes of each. 
Look at Fig. 1 again and you’ll 
see that barium is located above 
radium, which means that they 
are chemically similar. Uranium 
fission produced radioactive iso- 
topes with radium-barium char- 
acteristics; it was much easier to 
assume that the new radioactive

isotopes were radium isotopes. 

But Hahn and Strassmann be- 
came doubtful. In a repiort pub- 
lished early in 1939 they con- 
cluded with the words: “speak- 
ing as chemists we feel obliged 
to say that the new substances 
are not radium but barium.” In 
another report, only a few 
months later, they definitely said 
that the new isotopes were bar- 
ium, but still maintained that 
eka-rhenium, eka-osmium, etc. 
had been found. Actually they 
were isotopes of lanthanum and 
yttrium, which were not recog- 
nized because the chemical 

126 



methods used were aimed at 
finding elements with character- 
istics similar to the platinum 
metals. 

American researchers who had 
far better facilities and were al- 
ready armed with the knowledge 
that uranium broke down into 
medium-heavy elements also 
had a difficult time. They had 
produced element #93 (neptun- 
ium) and #94 (plutonium), and 
according to the rules neptunium 
should be chemically similar to 
rhenium and plutonium to os- 
mium. 

They were not — and the 
GALAXY 



problem was cleared up only 
after the second world war. 
Somebody might have guessed 
the truth, but I don’t know who 
did it first. Element #89 (actin- 
ium) is located on the table be- 
low #57 (lanthanum), and lan- 
thanum starts the strange series 
of the rare elements. Actinium, 
we know, starts a similar series; 
the elements from 89 to 103 (see 
Table II and Fig. 3) are now 
collectively called the actinides, 
and the tables resumed with the 
still undiscovered element #104. 

As Fig. 3 show.s, element

Too Many Esks 

by HAYDEN HOWARD 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 

Dr. West's main purpose in life 
was to save the Earth from an 
invasion no one else suspected! 



I 



ringing above the opened 
^ ’ harbor-ice, the immense 
flock of male sandpipers crowd- 
ed down on the thawing tundra. 
With menacing squeaks, the 
fragile sandpipers hopped at 
each other. Flurrying wings, 
they battled for nesting terri- 
tories close to the tiny pond. 

Too many sandpipers? Dr. 



Joe West rested beside his heavy 
pack and tried to force his 
thoughts ahead to the Arctic 
harbor, where the ragged tents 
were crowding. A squeaking 
sandpiper fled past his boot. Dr. 
West’s imagination recoiled from 
the harbor. He stared into the 
tiny pond, where wriggling 
swarms of mosquito larvae al- 
ready were pupating. 

Already there was a bloody 



128 



whine behind Dr. West’s ear. He 
slapped the back of his neck. 
“Dammit, I don’t want to end 
up like a criminal;” 

Through the mosquitos, he 
focused his binoculars against 
the bleak natural harbor. “I 
don’t want to be a martyr.” 

The distant' growling of the 
tractor-truck trundling food 
cases out of the beached L.S.T. 
was punctuated by a gun shot. 
Probably some bearded amateur 
humanitarian shooting at a sea- 
gull! Dr. West glared through 
his binoculars at the flamboy- 
ant amateur lettering across 
the hull of the chartered land- 
ing ship. BOOTHIA PENIN- 
SULA OR BUST — NEW 
YORK SAVE THE ESKIMOS 
DAY COMMITTEE. 

“No matter how many you 
feed there’ll be more.” Dr. West 
shook his head in a haze of 
mosquitos and refocused his bi- 
noculars at the tent-city rim- 
ming the harbor like dirty snow. 
With its explosive rate of 
growth, the tents would spread 
all the way inland to this pond 
before — 

Dr. West blinked. His ner- 
vous system tingled from sur- 
facing childhood guilt as he 
recognized through the binocu- 
lars, magnified and in com- 
pressed perspective beside a dis- 
tant plywood cabin, the uni- 
formed man, Mountie — Police 
TOO /AANY ESKS 



Inspector — Canadian police- 
man — cop, cop, cop! 

/^n the surface. Dr. West knew 
the problem was how to 
distribute the aerosol spray cans 
to the Esks without being 
traced. The depths of his prob- 
lem were more disturbing. 

He had landed his float plane 
on LaRue Lake, the long pond 
located an hour’s hike inland 
across the boggy tundra. No 
secrecy there. Two seaplanes 
and an amphibian already were 
tied up like spiders as if their 
pilots expected wind. Evidently 
the lake was safer than the ex- 
posed harbor. A grinning Esk 
had peered out of a single tent, 
probably a guard for the planes. 
Many muddy boot prints con- 
verged on deeper tracks, a trail 
left by all the airborne white- 
men who had hurried to in- 
spect the multiplying Esks. 

Through his binoculars. Dr. 
West studied the cop — the 
Mountie walking away from the 
plywood cabin and its tall radio 
mast. Striding past stacked 
supply crates, the Mountie went 
down the beach . toward the 
bearded characters lolling in 
front of the L.S.T. 

Liked a beached whale, the 
landing ship vomited the trac- 
tor-truck with another load of 
food cases. Up to the tents of 
the Esks, no one seemed to be 

129 



guarding the supplies. Perhaps 
during the past winter the R. C. 
M. P. had discovered that the 
Esks were more obedient, less 
tempted to thievery even than 
Eskimos. Dr. West frowned. 

Hordes of Esk children were 
romping around the boxes. Dr. 
West could not see any guards. 
He put away his binoculars. 

Glancing at the vast Arctic 
sky, he hoisted his pack, heavy 
with the disguised containers of 
aerosol spray. He plodded 
straight into the village. Con- 
cealment was impossible any- 
way. 

While the children scampered 
around him. Dr. West walked 
stiffly to meet the Mountie, who 
was striding up from the beach, 
in a swarm of mosquitos. 

“Sir, I recognize . you are 
Dr. Joseph West.” The Mountie 
managed to seem glad to see 
him. “As you predicted, sir, 
we’ve a rapidly growing com- 
munity.” The Mountie had a 
warm handshake. “It is . 
it is an honor, sir, to meet you. 
Sir, I’ve always considered you 
as the . the discoverer of 
these — people. A pleasure to 
meet you. Why don’t we con- 
tinue on to my cabin. Your 
flight, walking from the lake, 
you must be tired and hungry, 
sir.” He reached to relieve Dr. 
West of the weight of his pack. 

“Thank you,” Dr. West mut- 
130 



tered with embarrassment, allow- 
ing the Mountie to take the sur- 
prisingly heavy pack. 

For the moment, the Moun- 
tie was too courteous to ask if 
he had a Landing Permit. No 
doubt the politician, LaRue, had 
warned the R. C. M. P. to be 
on the lookout for Dr. West. 

Inside the cabin, mosquitos 
hummed across plywood walls 
lined with books, stereo com- 
ponents and photosatellite maps 
of the Boothia Peninsula. Evi- 
dently the Mountie expected a 
permanent assignment here. 

“Here’s my Landing Permit.” 
Dr. West handed it over with a 
belligerent smile. “Surprised?” 

“No, sir. Headquarters ra- 
dioed me to be expecting your 
aircraft.” The Mountie acted 
like a solid type who would not 
expose his surprise, even if a 
little green man from Uranus 
four-lettered on his R. C. M. P. 
hat. 

During tea and mosquitos. Dr. 
West opened his heavy pack. He 
lifted out a tape recorder, a 
strobe light with the largest size 
battery pack and a bulky bat- 
tery-operated 16mm movie cam- 
era. Due to efficient forethought, 
all this equipment used the 
same size cylindrical inter- 
changeable batteries. None of 
the equipment would work, be- 
cause each battery enclosed and 
concealed an aerosol spray can. 

GALAXY 



Dr. West glanced from the 
tape recorder to the Mountie’s 
mildly interested expression. 
“I’m looking for Eevvaalik,” Dr. 
West announced, and the Moun- 
tie’s eyelids flickered. 

I t was Dr. West who had been 
surprised when- his applica- 
tion for a Landing Permit fi- 
nally was granted. The Esks had 
become a political football, and 
footballs bounce both ways. A 
year ago. Cultural Sanctuary 
guards would have kept Dr. 
West out, but — 

In the Canadian Parliament, 
after listening to impassioned at- 
tacks by members of LaRue’s 
party against the Whole Cul- 
tural Sanctuary Commission 
concept and its incapability of 
caring for the exploding Esk 
population, the M.P.’s had re- 
fused to pass the annual ap- 
propriation for the Boothia Pen- 
insula Eskimo Cultural Sanc- 
tuary. 

When carry-over funds were 
exhausted, the Sanctuary Guards 
had to be withdrawn, and smil- 
ing politicians. Life photo- 
graphers, amazed gynecologists 
and disturbed Family Allow- 
ance administrators had landed 
on LaRue Lake and plodded 
across the tundra to gawk at 
the Esks. 

The Canadian government’s 
Family Planning nurses already 
TOO MANY ESKS 



had reported that the Esks 
showed discouragingly negative 
attitudes toward customary 
birth control techniques. 

When the rumor reached Ot- 
tawa that Family Planning nurs- 
es were injecting Esk women 
with a six-month ovulation-de- 
lay hormone and assuring the 
women it was a flu shot, there 
was more outraged oratory from 
old Etienne LaRue in Parlia- 
ment. The nurses were with- 
drawn. Landing Permits were 
limited. Dr. West’s application 
was not answered. 

Ignored rather than specifi- 
cally denied by some cautious 
clerk. Dr. West had suspected 
the bureaucrats still were hold- 
ing their fingers up to test the 
winds of change. 

Dr. West’s past reputation in 
population control research for 
the U. S. Defense Department 
was enough for LaRue to de- 
mand he be kept out. 

In Canada, from one side 
blew the dinosaur’s breath of old 
Etienne LaRue, opposing any 
population limitation for the 
Esks or anyone else. Whether 
the Esks might vote for his 
party was unimportant, he said. 

On the other side were in- 
creasingly disquieted bureau- 
crats and politicians responsible 
for the food, clothing and well- 
being of the rapidly increasing 
Esks. Unless something sensible 

131 



were done, taxes would have 
to increase. 

Eventually, addressed to Dr. 
West, a Landing Permit was is- 
sued with an illegible signature. 
Some bureaucrat hoped to re- 
main anonymous. 

“You’re quite lucky, sir,” the 
Mountie was saying, “to locate 
her. Eevvaalik was brought to 
this camp two weeks ago. Our 
doctor tells me she is quite ill, 
T.B.” 

The thought flashed through 
Dr. West’s mind, when he fled 
from the Boothia Peninsula, he 
must take Eevvaalik with him. 
Kidnapping? Last winter, Eev- 
vaalik refused to go. Now would 
she harshly scream and fight 
and cough? This might be his 
last chance. In California, he 
could get professional help in 
interrogating her. Depth hyp- 
nosis aided by pentathol injec- 
tions might expose what Eev- 
vaalik claimed she could not 
bear to remember. Unreason- 
ably, sometimes she claimed all 
the Esks were her children. 
What had created the first Esk? 
Locked in her greasy head — 

II 

CC''T^his way, sir.” As the 
-*■ Mountie led him through 
the aimless crowds of grinning 
Esks toward Eevvaalik’s tent. 
Dr. West knew he ought to add 
132 



kidnapping to his crimes. He 
was already suspected of it. The 
day before he took off from 
California, an inside page of the 
San Francisco Chronicle had 
carried excerpts from Etienne 
LaRue’s latest speech in Mon- 
treal. As an addendum to florid 
attacks upon Canada’s birth- 
control clinics, public schools, 
and parking problem, Etienne 
LaRue demanded to know why 
the government had not investi- 
gated the kidnapping last win- 
ter of an Eskimo, a certain Mar- 
thalik, now reported to be held 
against her will in California. 

Marthalik had gone willing- 
ly with Dr. West to California. 
She was an Esk, not an Eskimo. 
The only one of her uncounted 
children Dr. West had brought 
with her might be his son. Not 
yet three years old, the smil- 
ing boy already managed under- 
standable English. Terrifyingly, 
he was as large and agile and 
mature as a 12-year-old boy, 
or any other 3-year-old Esk. 

“In this tent,” the Mountie 
was saying. “Eevvaalik?” 

The tents were Canadian 
Army surplus and looked it. 
Eevvaalik crouched in the dim 
corner beside her hollowed stone 
seal-oil lamp, empty. Dr. West 
unslung his heavy pack. 

“Eh-eh,” she laughed, im- 
mediately recognizing him. “It 
is The-Whiteman-Who-Was-Bit- 

GALAXY 



ten-By-A-Dog.” Coughing, she 
gasped: “Tell this person of her 
husband.” 

“Peterluk has much to eat. 
He has a warm place to sleep,” 
Dr. West answered. “The Gov- 
ernment would not let me go 
in to see him.” 

“A good place,” Eevvaalik 
said hopefully. “This person 
wishes to be there also.” 

Silently, the Mountie left the 
tent. Mosquitos whined. 

Dr. West smiled at Eevvaalik 
as he knelt beside her and felt 
lier pulse. In a way he was 
sorry that her weakness had 
drained away her crusty in- 
d(]iendence. Probably she was 
the only real Eskimo in the 
camp. 

“Y ou would like it in Ottawa,” 
he said, meaning California, be- 
ginning to think she would go 
with him to the plane with no 
trouble at all. 

“Eh-eh,” she laughed. “What 
is this warm prison called?” 

“The New Ottawa Reforma- 
tion Center. They say each per- 
son has his own igloo in the 
tower.” Dr. West laid his hand 
on her brow, wishing he had 
brought a thermometer. 

“Peterluk needs a woman,” 
Eevvaalik laughed. “This per- 
son will be stronger soon.” She 
slapped her bony chest. “This 
p<Tson can still do it with Pet- 
erluk the way he likes.” She 
TOO AAANY ESKS 



managed a feeble leer at Dr. 
West. “So you take this person 
to her husband.” 

“Soon-soon,” Dr. West sighed, 
regretting he had not even 
brought a sleeping injection 
from his medical bag which now 
seemed so far away in the 
plane on LaRue Lake. 

Ignoring the mosquitos, leath- 
er-skinned old Eevvaalik slept. 

''T^his tent seemed the only 
'*■ place where Dr. West could 
escape the thousand eyes. Swift- 
ly, he opened the back of the 
tape recorder, took out the bat- 
teries. Prying off the top of 
a cylindrical battery, he remov- 
ed a small, orange aerosol can 
labeUed MOSQUITO SPRAY. 

With his heavy-bladed hunt- 
ing knife he dug hard-packed 
filth-clotted gravel from the 
floor of the tent. He refilled 
the battery with gravel. Jam- 
ming on the top, he fitted the 
battery back into the tape re- 
corder. By the time he had 
operated on all the batteries in 
the tape recorder, in the battery 
pack for the strobe light and in 
the battery-powered camera, he 
had 16 aerosol cans labelled 
MOSQUITO SPRAY. 

He was sweating with haste 
and fright as he removed the 
rigidity boards from the square 
pack, dovetailed the boards to- 
gether and opened the little 

133 



package -of box nails. He ham- 
mered the box together using 
the butt of his hunting knife. 
The outside of the box was 
stamped: MOSQUITO SPRAY 
— NEW YORK SAVE THE 
ESKIMOS DAY COMMIT- 
TEE — 334, a non-existent but 
likely looking invoice number. 

If he had planned all of this 
sooner, if he had made the ter- 
rible decision earlier. Dr. West 
thought, he might have planted 
this box in the freight car to 
Churchill on Hudson Bay or 
in the L.S.T. when it was be- 
ing loaded. He might have 
avoided this risk. But here he 
was. 

No excuse, even now, ahead 
of the Government’s plan to re- 
settle the Esks, he might have 
been able to place these terri- 
ble cans in the next food ship- 
ment and never come to the 
Boothia Peninsula. But here he 
was. “What makes me do these 
things?” 

It was as dim outside as it 
would ever be. The crazy orange 
sun was looping down to the 
horizon and would rise without 
setting.' 

Dr. West withdrew his head 
into the tent. Leaving the pho- 
tographic equipment on the gra- 
vel floor, he fitted the wooden 
box containing the aerosol cans 
into his pack. Their spray would 
not kill mosquitos. 

134 



When he tried to walk past 
hordes of playing children, they 
followed him. Like Eskimo chil- 
dren they didn’t keep regular 
sleeping hours. Here it was mid- 
night. They ran ahead of him 
toward a stack of unopened 
wooden crates stamped: DEHY- 
DRATED FREEZE-DRIED 
218. 

Children swarmed ahead of 
him onto the crates, giggling. 
Little girls hummed and flapped 
their skinny arms. 

My iod, I can't really do it, 
Dr. West thought. Let the Cana- 
dian government do it. They’ve 
got to, eventually. But most 
Canadian economists insisted 
the country was underpopulat- 
ed. He thought of China, India 
— still increasing. 

More disillusioning, in the 
U.S. during 1968-70 when use 
of THE PILL was most wide- 
spread the birth-rate had start- 
ed down. Then the Pentagon 
had become frantic because the 
future supply of scientists and 
soldiers was diminishing in com- 
parison with unfriendly coun- 
tries whose birth rates remained 
high. 

U. S. economists became dis- 
turbed because production was 
geared to a population growth 
rate of about 3% per year, and 
this slump to a 1% population 
increase might be leading to- 
ward a recession. Increased 

GALAXY 



space spending and accelerated 
pump priming were not taking 
up the slack. There would not 
be enough future consumers, un- 
less, as one of the less inhibited 
tele-commentators put it: “The 
opinion media embark on a 
massive educational program of 
mother-priming.” 

Four children became the 
minimum family size in adver- 
tisements. Income tax deduc- 
tions were raised to $1,000 for 
the first child, another $1,500 
for the second, an additional 
$2,000 for the third and on up. 
Publicity was given to patrio- 
tically large families. New ex- 
cise taxes increased the costs of 
birth-control pills. The popula- 



tion growth rate increased to 
more than 3%. 

In defiance of a vast array 
of birth-control methods avail- 
able in the richest country in 
the world, the U.S. population 
was now increasing at 4% per 
year. The 250 million popula- 
tion would double in 25 years. 

This rate increase was tor- 
toise-slow compared with the 
Esks. 

4C\^^hat got for us?” The 
’ '^roundly innocent face of 
an Esk boy peeked over the 
supply crates close to Dr. West, 
and the suddenly grinning boy 
opened his little hands; he was 
a clown.

“Nothing. Everything.” Dr. 
West answered. 

Laughing, all the children be- 
gan jabbering at once. Their 
modern Eskimo dialect seemed 
cruder, clumsier than Dr. West 
remembered from a year ago. 
With only other Esks as their 
models for growing up so quick- 
ly, would each generation be 
simpler, more crudely hewn than 
the last? 

Dr. West asked if any of 
them could read. He pointed to 
the marks on the boxes. None 
of the children grasped what 
he meant. They didn’t know 
about reading. 

Dr. West thought they would 
not have time to learn. They 
would be adults and breeding by 
the time they were 5 years old. 
Could they learn to read? How 
long would they live? No one 
knew yet. Some of the first 
generations 5 years ago had 
shown a slight grasp of ab- 
stractions. Was this a declining 
ability? Those first Esks had 
two real Eskimos, Peterluk and 
Eewaalik, as models. Now these 
children saw only other inex- 
perienced Esks as their models 
for growing up. “Do you hunt 
walrus?” Dr. West asked. “Play 
at hunting walrus? Harpoon? 
Seal?” 

“Wal-rus?” Already these 2- 
year-old and 3-year-old chil- 
dren, who looked like 12 -year- 

136 



olds, didn’t know what walrus 
were. Due to the outspreading 
population pressure around this 
harbor where the supplies were 
landed, Esk children might not 
even see a seal. A little girl 
climbed onto Dr. West’s lap. 
“Tell me of our grandfather in 
the sky.” 

“Once there was a great white 
bear who looked down from the 
stars,” Dr. West began, but since 
he last was on the Boothia Pen- 
insula the myth must have been 
crystallized in a new order, be- 
cause the children giggled and 
began telling him the story. 

“That star. That star.” They 
were pointing, but in the sun- 
faded Arctic night the star was 
invisible to Dr. West. 

“That star flying to this place 
closer all the time,” the boy ex- 
plained patiently. “That is how 
we began. Grandfather bear send 
part of himself ahead. He say 
be fruitful and multiply and 
prepare this place for me.” 

“What does fruitful mean?” 
Dr. West asked. “Multiply?” 

“Don’t know yet,” the boy 
answered solemnly. “But — 
when we have covered the 
world. Grandfather bear will 
come. And once again all of 
us will become one. It will feel 
so good.” 

The children giggled and 
laughed and clapped their hands, 
echoing: “Will feel so good.”

L ike children everywhere, 
their attention was shift- 
ing. They lost interest in Dr. 
West and ran away to play. 
Dr. West listened to their shrill 
voices in the distance, while he 
removed the wooden box of 
aerosol spray cans from his pack 
and left it among the bigger 
wooden crates. He walked away, 
his heart beating faster instead 
of slower. 

What are you doing? Dr. 
West’s young-old face twisted 
as if a spear was probing his 
heart. I'm doing what has to 
he done now. What can’t be 
done after the Esks have spread 
through the Canadian popula- 
tion. 

But do you know what you 
are doing? Dr. West blindly hur- 
ried away, thinking of Martha- 
lik’s gently smiling face across 
the breakfast table in Califor- 
nia. Anxious to please him, she 
had repeated that she was glad 
not to be bothered with a baby: 
“1 dream about many babies. 
Something — Grandfather Bear 
from the sky? Silly dream.” 
Like the waxing moon her rest- 
lessness returned each month, 
and she cried out in her sleep; 
but to him she laughed with 
anbarrassment: “Eh-eh, it feels 
strange not to have a baby 
every month. Feels strange not 
to accomplish anything.” 

TOO MANY ESKS 



At the start of the experi- 
ment, Dr. West had sat with his 
arms around her, both of them 
inhaling the bacterial endospores. 
In 24 hours Marthalik had run 
a temperature of 99 degrees; his 
temperature had been 100. For 
a few days she mentioned vague 
internal itchings. Then her ob- 
vious symptoms vanished. She 
had “recovered.” But each 
childless month her restlessness 
returned more forcibly. Now in 
her dreams, which she would 
or could not describe, she shout- 
ed — in anger? At him? 

Do you know what you are 
doing to these people psycholo- 
gically? Dr. West pushed into 
Eevvaalik’s tent and shoved his 
photographic equipment into his 
pack. I can’t even predict all 
their physical reactions to this 
pathogen. 

He winced at the thought of 
children playing with the orange 
cans. 

Endospores of the bacteria 
were “sleeping” in these aero- 
sol cans marked MOSQUITO 
SPRAY. It was true the bac- 
teria had been repeatedly test- 
ed on chimps and humans while 
he was Director of Oriental 
Population Problems Research 
at the University of California. 
A mildly virulent strain, but 
bred to be resistant to the range 
of antibiotics available in cer- 
tain nations, their infection tend- 

137 



ed to cause a swelling of the 
Fallopian tubes. 

In four to five years some 
of the original test women in 
California began having babies 
again, although timewise more 
widely spaced. Here was the 
potentiality for controlling the 
population growth of other na- 
tions, secretly, unilaterally. 

The research had been funded 
by a Defense Department grant. 
By the time the young, contri- 
buting scientists discovered their 
first gray hairs, their enthusiasm 
had faded. Dr. West was parti- 
cularly susceptible to guilt feel- 
ings. After he jockeyed into the 
Director’s job. Dr. West diverted 
bacterial research to a charac- 
teristic not in the Pentagon’s 
original specifications. It was 
a limiting, time-space character- 
istic which was a triumph of 
bacterial genetics. The bacteria 
were genetically altered until 
they exhibited consistently self- 
attenuating virulency. 

Self-attenuating, like the rip- 
ples from a stone dropped into 
a pond, as the bacterial in- 
fection spread outward through 
the population its virulency 
would spread outward to noth- 
ing. It could not infect the 
world. From a single source, it 
could not even engulf a small 
country. 

This had disappointed the 
Pentagon, as Dr. West bitterly 
138 



recalled. The Defense Depart- 
ment reduced several of its fin- 
ancial grants to the University, 
a warning slash on the wrist. 
The University’s lifeblood was 
government-financed research, 
so it became vital that Dr. 
Joseph West should resign as 
Director of Oriental Population 
Problems Research. 

■X ¥ rith a little “pencil-and- 
can-of-beans” research 
grant. Dr. West had returned to 
Arctic endocrinology. Camping 
with what he thought were Es- 
kimos, he felt secretly relieved 
to be out as Director. Trying 
to act like an organization man 
had been raising hell with his 
blood pressure. But these Es- 
kimos didn’t act like the Es- 
kimos he remembered from his 
previous trips to the Arctic. 
Slowly like a blind man, he 
clumsily “saw” that they were 
not. Then Marthalik, the girl 
he had been sleeping with, 
swelled up an gave birth within 
a month. A month? 

When he had returned to 
California with Marthalik, the 
men in population research 
thought his report was a prac- 
tical joke — until Marthalik 
gave birth at monthly inter- 
vals. Then he got professional 
cooperation. Marthalik was the 
only Esk on whom the popula- 
tion-limiting bacteria had been 

GALAXY 



tested. A time-threat appeared. 
Dr. West had to act quickly, 
when he learned the Canadian 
Government was preparing to 
resettle the Esks throughout the 
North. From a scientific point 
of view he knew he had acted 
too quickly, insanely. One Esk 
was not a valid sample. 

All members of a species will 
not react the same way to a 
new disease. In his mind, on a 
graph, a bell-shaped curve con- 
fronted him. Individual reac- 
tions tend to group along a bell- 
shaped curve. On the lip of the 
“bell” a few have surprisingly 
slight reactions to a disease. The 
great majority of people along 
the hump of the curve have the 
typical illness. A few down the 
other side of the bell-curve suf- 
fer violent reactions. 

Dr. West’s face tightened like 
a death mask. If the virulent 
side of the bell graph had a 
cut-off appearance with a pop- 
ulation line rising straight up 
from maximum virulency, the 
researcher would be looking at 
an abstract line of corpses. 

“God, forgive me!” Dr. West 
couldn’t know where Martha- 
lik’s mild reaction would fit 
on a bell- shaped curve of the 
entire infected Esk population. 

/ tell you / had to act now 
before these people sdattered. Dr. 
West wondered if he had spok- 
en out loud. 

TOO MANY ESKS 




“We will go now,” Dr. West 
said quietly, and he knelt be- 
side Eevvaalik and began to 
help her up. 

“Eh-eh, this person stand by 
herself.” Eevvaalik swayed 
while he supported her arm, and 
as she shuffled across the tent 
floor she was temporarily halted 
by a paroxysm of coughing, and 
then she continued on out into 
the garish Arctic day-night un- 
der her own power. “Eh-eh, big 
sky.” 

Her legs sagged, and Dr. West 
supported her while the mosqui- 
tos whined. 

D r. West knew he was going 
to need strong help to carry 

139 



Eewaalik all the way across 
the tundra to his plane. He 
hoped the Mountie was asleep. 
Quietly, Dr. West drafted four 
Esks. Unquestioningly they tried 
to obey him. Finally, two of 
the Esks understood — observ- 
ed from him how to form a 
carrying-chair of their inter- 
locked hands for Eewaalik. The 
other two Esks wandered along 
behind. Dr. West was beginning 
to think he would get away with 
Eewaalik. 

The Mountie blundered to- 
ward them, his hair still rumpled 
with sleep, his eyes blinking in 
the weak midnight sunglow. Dr. 
West realized that an Esk must 
have been instructed to watch 
constantly, and the Esk had run 
to awaken the Mountie. 

“Sir, if she is so ill,” the 
Mountie mumbled, “you’d best 
take her to my cabin.” He add- 
ed apologetically: “Our doctor 
isn’t here. Gone to Walrus Point 
Encampment two sleeps ago. Put 
her in my cabin. I’ll send a boy 
for our doctor’s reserve kit, if 
you want to give her something.” 

Dr. West started to speak 
and couldn’t. It was now or 
never. 

The Mountie blinked at the 
pair of Esks. “You, you, walk 
slow. Carry old woman to big 
cabin.” 

“Eh? Not old,” Eewaalik pro- 
tested faintly as they carried 

140 



her off and away from Dr. West. 

“Sir, you’ll want some tea.” 
The Mountie’s hand closed on 
Dr. West’s arm and steered him 
toward the cabin. 

It was as if the Mountie knew 
how Marthalik had been re- 
moved to California and didn’t 
intend to let Dr. West fly off 
with Eewaalik as well. 

Dr. West felt suddenly old. 
As he v.?a!ked, he resisted the 
urge to glance toward the stack 
of crates. Had the Esk spy 
witnessed him hiding the box 
of spray cans and thought to 
teU the Mountie of the little 
box the Whiteman had left 
among the crates? 

“You, you put her on the 
floor. Over there by stove,” 
the Mountie was ordering the 
Esks as they went into the 
cabin. To Dr. West the Mountie 
smiled wanly. “I’m not afraid 
of a little T.B.” 

“Eevvaalik’s was an arrested 
case of T.B.,” Dr. West said. 
“What was the doctor — how 
was the doctor treating her?” 
“Don’t know, sir. I thought 
antibiotics cured that sort of 
thing nowadays, but — are the 
germs, sir, getting ahead of us? 
I’d thought she was better.” 
“Have you seen T.B. among 
the Esks?” It was a rhetorical 
question. Dr. West was nerving 
himself to walk defiantly out of 
the cabin and hike to his plane. 

GALAXY 



“None, sir. Esks all seem 
sound as Canadian dollars,” the 
Mountie laughed wearily. 
“Healthier than the rest of us.” 
“And multiplying a hell of a 
lot faster,” Dr. West blurted, 
realizing he was going to stay 
and see it out to the end no 
matter what happened. 

“One chap had a crate fall 
on his foot today, sir. Bloody 
mess. He’s not complaining of 
much pain, but Esks don’t,” the 
Mountie’s sleepy voice rambled 
on. “Bloody mess. Sir, since the 
doctor may not be back for 
days, I was hoping you’d have 
a look at this injured Esk, Not 
now, sir. After you’ve slept. 

Dr. West knew the Mountie 
didn’t intend for him to leave. 
He was the mouse. Was the 
Mountie the cat? He sat down 
on the corner bunk. 

Swirling with 36 hours of 
e.-<hau.stion. Dr. West slept 
among the whirling mosquitos.

rhen Dr. West awoke, there 
’ ’ was an intermittent hiss- 
ing noise within the cabin. He 
opened his eyes and watched 
the Mountie moving around in 
the cabin with one arm up- 
raised, waving a little orange 
can. A masking odor of artifi- 
cial pine trees drifted down 
upon Dr. West’s face. Breathing 
TOO MANY ESKS 



quickly. Dr. West raised him- 
self on one elbow. 

The Mountie lowered the 
orange-colored aerosol spray 
can. “You’ve had a good sleep, 
sir. Canned bacon for break- 
fast, sir?” 

Dr. West couldn’t open his 
mouth to answer. His contract- 
ing stomach was about to crawl 
out of his mouth as he watched 
the Mountie using the Mosquito 
Spray. 

“Any time I wake up,” the 
Mountie’s voice chatted on, “I 
call that meal my breakfast. I 
miss not having fried seal liver. 
This spray must be the slow- 
acting kind. Ah, see that mos- 
quito! Still circling around like 
a Skua. Skua’s a fierce gull. 
Nearest thing we have to a 
vulture. Sir, do you want your 
eggs sunny-side up? Those 
bearded chaps from New York 
may think themselves better 
than uniformed men, but the 
girl, skinny little thing — she’s 
the cook in their landing ship, 
made me a present of these 
dozen eggs. A uniform always 
appeals to the women, sir. Never 
fails. Made me a present of 
this strawberry jam. How many 
pieces of bacon will you be hav- 
ing, sir?” He sprayed near the 
frying pan. 

The overpowering odor of 
frying bacon whirled around as 
Dr. West blundered outside and 

141 




threw up before an interested 
audience of young Esks. They 
were impressed by his dry 
heaves for a few moments. Then, 
giggling, a boy chased a girl 
through the crowd, spraying her 
face with the mist from an 
orange can. She was inhaling a 
fog of millions of bacterial 
spores. 

When Dr. West went back 
into the bacon-reeking cabin, 
the mosquitos were whining un- 
abated. The spray was harm- 
less to mosquitos. 

Eewaalik was awake. Squat- 
ting in the corner, she was de- 
vouring Dr. West’s unfinished 
breakfast. 

142 



“Here, sir, a good cup of tea 
will swish out the stomach, I 
always say.” The Mountie 
cheerfully waved his hand at a 
mosquito. “When you feel fit, I 
hope you’ll take a look at the 
Esk with the crushed foot.” The 
mountie evidently intended to 
keep Dr. West as long as he 
could. 

Dr. West knew the Mountie 
had been in communication with 
his superiors by radio. Were 
they belatedly checking out the 
“kidnapping” of Marthalik? 
That might necessitate telephone 
calls to authorities in Califor- 
nia. Reputedly the R. C. M. P. 
were sticklers as to legal pro- 
cedure, careful as to the rights 
of a suspect. 

'"T^his Mountie might think Dr. 

West was attempting to make 
off with Eewaalik, but proof 
to a judge would be difficult if 
Dr. West denied that intent. 
Temporary impasse — 

After inspecting the crushed 
foot of the grinning Esk, Dr. 
West told the Mountie he want- 
ed to walk to his plane to get 
his medical bag. Instead, the 
Mountie sent an Esk to get it. 

In that irritating moment. Dr. 
West hoped this damned, smug 
Mountie would be susceptible to 
the endospores from the aerosol 
can. In males the infection 
sometimes produced uncomfort- 

GALAXY 



able and embarrassing symp- 
toms like prostatitus. In 24 
hours he would know — 

I n 24 hours the Mountie ap- 
peared crestfallen. Presum- 
ably his latest radio conversa- 
tion indicated the R. C. M. P. 
had not yet convinced a judge 
that a crime had been commit- 
ted. No warrant had been is- 
sued. Dr. West felt like telling 
the Mountie to go to hell. He 
felt like walking off to his plane 
without looking back. He might 
get away with it. 

“Sir, there’s a woman having 
a bit of trouble giving birth.” 
With so many Esks around all 
day, the Mountie produced one 
inescapable case after another 
for Dr. West. 

“Serves her right for having 
one every month!” 

“I know you don’t mean that, 
sir. She’s a mother.” 

“Of course she’s a super- 
mother.” 

“Sir?” 

“She’ll produce so many chil- 
dren that your children won’t 
have room to sit down.” 

“I’m a bachelor, sir.” 

“You’re a human being. You’ll 
be one of an inundated spe- 
cies.” 

“Sir, are you talking about 
birth control? We were warn 
— An 5 Tway it doesn’t seem to 
do any good. The Family Plan- 
TOO AAANY ESKS 



ning nurses said the Esk women 
WANT to have more babies.” 
“And just what did the nurs- 
es do to prevent it?” 

To this question the Mountie 
colored with embarrassment. 
“This and that, sir. Pills and 
all. When they found out what 
the pills were for, the Esk wom- 
en threw the pills away.” 
“There are other female 
methods than pills.” 

“I’m a bachelor, sir. I — not 
instructed in the R. C. M. P.” 
“Like diaphragms?” Dr. West 
continued maliciously at this 
Victorian-Uniformed Mountie. 
“Diaphragms,” Dr. West re- 
peated. “I suppose those 
wouldn’t be practical if the 
women resisted. And intra- 
uterine devices, little curlycues 
of plastic or stainless steel. Even 
with cooperative women there 
is a 20% expulsion rate. Did 
the nurses try hormone injec- 
tions on the Esk women? Tech- 
nically, science is equipped to 
control births in any number 
of ways. Some hormone injec- 
tions prevent ovulation for six 
months. Didn’t they try in- 
jections?” 

“Sir, now these Esk women 
won’t even let the doctor hypo 
them for blood tests, or measles 
preventative shots, or — ” 

“You mean some fool told 
them what the birth control 
injections were for?” 



143

“Sir, you can’t inject people 
against their v/ill.” The Moun- 
tie’s face was sweating. “You 
can’t just seize people and in- 
ject them from having babies. 
Our whole Canadian democratic 
system ■ — ’’ The Mountie sat 
down red-faced. 

“Let me take your tempera- 
ture,” said Dr. West. 

“I’m all right, sir. I’m never 
ill.” 

The Mountie’s temperature 
was already 100, and there was 
no way to know how much higher 
it would rise. 

“I’m all right, sir. Do you 
think an outsider has brought 
in the flu? Those bearded types 
in the L.S.T., they do a lot of 
coughing. I’ve eaten several 
meals with them. I’m never ill, 
sir, but I’m concerned about our 
Eskimos.” 

The Mountie peered out the 
door. “They used to be quite 
susceptible, sir. Back in 1968 
we had severe influenza which 
started in Baffinland. We tried 
to quarantine. We watched it 
spread on he map . .” 

“I’ll go out,” Dr. West said, 
cautiously. 

The Mountie opened his 
mouth as if to protest. Whether 
from concern that Dr. West also 
might be a flu carrier or that 
Dr. West might make an un- 
authorized departure, the Moun- 
tie did not say. 

144 



D r. West observed some of the 
children were sitting rather 
than racing around. When he 
dipped his thermometer in the 
alcohol tube, women squeaked 
with fright and edged away. 
Apparently the women were 
afraid he was preparing to in- 
ject them with a new kind of 
no-baby needle. This was con- 
firmed by the laughter of the 
men. Children were giggling. 

After much instruction and 
demonstration to ensure they did 
not bite off the thermometer, Dr. 
West began taking the children’s 
temperatures. Most of this small 
group were running temperatures 
of 99 to 100. 

The ■ Mountie appeared be- 
hind him, breathing hard and 
keeping away from the Esks. 
Mosquitos clustered on his blot- 
chy face. “Sir, do you think — ■ 
I think I shall order an imme- 
diate quarantine of this vil- 
lage.” 

From a distance, the Moun- 
tie told certain men to carry 
his words through the village, 
guards should be appointed and 
so forth. 

While Esks might be more 
obedient than Eskimos, as the 
day dragged on Dr. West ob- 
served several groups departing. 
The guards protested, gestured, 
tried to explain. But Esks never 

GALAXY 



use force. The Esks accepted 
life as cheerfully and non-com- 
batively as if it were a dream 
soon to be ended. Soon guards 
and departees all were laugh- 
ing. The guards waved good- 
bye. The departees trudged 
north along the coast toward one 
of the smaller camps. They had 
no sleds, no dogs. The Esks bred 
so much faster, that the dogs 
had become a rare minority, 
mainly eaten. Most of the ac- 
cessible seals had been killed. 
The younger Esks wore only 
war-surplus khaki. When win- 
ter returned, Dr. West thought, 
there would be misery and 
death. 

The miseries predicted for the 
world by Malthus: “the con- 

stant tendency of all animated 
life to increase beyond the 
nourishment prepared for it” 
would be demonstrated upon 
the Esks as if in a speeded-up 
movie of the next 100 years of 
the human population explo- 
sion. Soon. 

Dr. West knew the Esk popu- 
lation would not achieve starva- 
tion-balance with its harsh Arc- 
tic environment because human- 
itarians would continue to send 
in food — to fuel new babies. 
The Esks would spread south. 

“At the least, this epidemic 
will slow the birth-rate,” Dr. 
West muttered in self-justifi- 
cation, “and give the Canadian 
TOO MANY ESKS 



government time to formulate a 
policy, before the Western Hem- 
isphere is overrun.” He realized 
he was talking to himself again 
and closed his mouth. Western 
Hemisphere overrun sounded — 
ridiculous. 

At least this epidemic will 
demonstrate, tor the first time 
on a large group, what planned 
population control can 'accom- 
plish. “Quickly, cheaply, almost 
humanely — ” 

By the next day. Dr. West’s 
confidence was shaken. Most of 
the Esks showed symptoms of 
the disease, but mild symptoms 
on the bell-shaped curve. Mar- 
thalik’s must have been a severe 
case. 

A few Esks showed tempera- 
tures of as much as 100. Un- 
fortunately, Esks were more re- 
sistant than humans. Not only 
were they completely immune to 
T.B., they were only mildly af- 
fected by this population con- 
trol disease. 

I t was the Mountie who was 
sick. His temperature had 
risen to 102 degrees. 

Dr. West discovered the 
bearded humanitarians in the 
LST were running temperatures 
of over 101 to 103. The two 
Life photographers were con- 
fined to their tent. The bleary- 
eyed Mountie radioed for air- 
borne medical help. 



145 



Dr. West stared down at old 
Eewaalik shivering in the blan- 
kets of what had been Dr. 
West’s bed. Her temperature 
was approaohing 105 degrees. 
He lost his nerve and began to 
cool her with damp rags. He 
forced aspirin between her dry 
lips. She whined at the bitter 
taste. 

“Let this — person,” she pro- 
tested, “ — find happiness. Do 
not ... do things. No. Eh-eh.” 
She laughed or coughed. “You 
not sick — don’t know.” 

He tried to force another as- 
pirin. 

“Pah!” she spat it back. “You 
don’t know.” 

Unexpectedly, she said: “You 
don’t even know — this per- 
son is the mother of everybody- 
Eh-eh.” 

“Yes, I know that.” Dr. West 
knelt beside her. He glanced at 
the tape recorder, but the bat- 
teries were filled with gravel. 
“I know you are the mother. 
Who is the father? What did he 
look like?” 

“Terrible, this person feels 
terrible,” Eewaalik moaned. 
“This person, eh-eh, won’t re- 
member until you make her 
feel so good.” 

Even now, was she still teas- 
ing him, holding back her 
knowledge for some last advan- 
tage? Dr. West did not know. 

Eewaalik was prattling about 
146 



her youth, when she was a 
young girl. “Eh-eh, in those 
days, few Itmuit (Eskimos), 
many seals. This person asleep 
with full belly.” 

“Want to sleep,” she cried 
out in sudden anguish, “Help 
me! Want to sleep.” 

By contrast, the Mountie kept 
getting out of bed. He stag- 
gered between the window and 
the radio closet, where his two- 
way radio equipment was hous- 
ed. “Sir, until the medical plane 
gets here, and it never will, 
what with fog and carburetor 
difficulties and false promises, 
sir, we’ve got to do something 
for these people.” 

“They’re not as sick as you 
are.” 

“Sir, the old woman looks 
like she’s dying.” 

“Not likely,” Dr. West an- 
swered with more confidence 
than he felt. “She — and you 
are the two with the highest 
temperatures.” 

“I’m responsible for all these 
people, sir. I should have kept 
this disease from spreading. The 
operator at Seal Camp says the 
fever has already reached there. 
Says some of my people arrived 
there yesterday. Why don’t you 
do something, you’re a doctor, 
or were a doctor.” The Mountie 
staggered back to the radio 
closet without waiting for a 
reply. 



GALAXY 



Dr. West bent over the fit- 
fully sleeping Eevvaalik. He had 
started both Eevvaalik and the 
Mountie on a course of terra- 
mycin capsules, to keep down 
any secondary bacterial infec- 
tions. Against the bacteria now 
spreading its poison through 
the narrow tube-structures of 
their bodies there was a spe- 
cific anti-botic, but he did not 
have it. It would not have been 
available to him without a risky 
theft from one of the guarded 
laboratories in California. It was 
a classified military secret, as 
were the bacteria in the spray 
cans. 

Dr. West smiled bitterly. For 
conspiring with others to “bor- 
row” a starter sample of this 
population-control bacteria, for 
stealing a military secret, he was 
already liable to prosecution by 
the U. S. Government. If the 
spray cans and the bacteria 
were traced to him, and he was 
taken back to the U.S., — he 
remembered what happened to 
men who stole other military 
secrets — 

“Now the radioman at Stone 
Bay says it’s popped up there.” 
The Mountie was clumsily 
charting the new locations of 
the illness on his wall map. 
“It’s what we did during the 
flu epidemic,” he muttered in- 
effectively. “The date of ap- 
pearance and where the visitors 
TOO AAANY ESKS 



came from. I keep telling them 
to cut off every camp from 
every other camp. Spreads and 
spreads.” 

VI 

''X^he next day the promised 
-*■ medical plane still had not 
even taken off. Engine distri- 
butor trouble was reported, and 
the Mountie blundered around 
the cabin, flopping down on 
the bed and sleeping fitfully. 

By now, radio operators up 
and down the coast were com- 
paring virulency of the disease 
in their respective encampments. 
The bacteria had spread south 
from one coastal camp to the 
next, until mild cases were re- 
ported in the fifth camp. Only 
a few mild cases in the fifth 
camp. 

“Here, they had it worse, but 
they’re getting better.” The 
Mountie looked out the door- 
way. The Esks at their camp 
were becoming more active. The 
disease was running its course. 

At Dr. West’s suggestion, the 
flying boat was diverted to an- 
other camp. The Mountie seem- 
ed to want the flying boat here 
first, but he agreed, temporar- 
ily. 

The next day as his fever de- 
clined, the Mountie put more 
detail into his chart — as if 
a map showing the spread of 

147 



the disease magically could 
control the disease. 

“I can’t understand this,” the 
Mountie said. “It seems to have 
stopped going south. In the fifth 
encampment, they say there are 
visitors from the fourth encamp- 
ment but no one in the fifth 
encampment has it bad enough 
to matter. A few slight fevers. 
Do you think it’s halted here?” 
He pressed his thick finger 
against the map. 

“Yes.” Dr. West winced; a 
clue was stalking him. 

On each of the five encamp- 
ments to the south, the map 
contained the Mountie’s scrawl- 
ed date for the reported arrival 
of visitors. “Everyone’s done a 
terrible job of not keeping vis- 
itors out, sir. More inefficient 
than during the flu. So many 
more people now, but it’s no ex- 
cuse, sir.” 

In the village immediately 
south of them about 50% of 
the Esks reportedly had been 
sick — in the second village, 
20% to 25%, in the third vil- 
lage, in the fourth village, 10% 
and in the fifth village there 
were only a few with a mild 
fever or other symptoms. 

“As it went south, it died 
out,” the Mountie murmured. 
“It’s not like flu, is it, sir?” 

“No, it isn’t,” Dr. West 
agreed. 

Staring at the opposite ex- 
148 



tension of the disease on the- 
map in a northerly direction. Dr. 
West began to have a trapped 
feeling. A clue as to the origin 
of the disease was beginning to 
take shape on the map. 

“The two villages nearest to 
the north of us had it as bad 
as we did,” the Mountie said, 
talking to himself. “Then it 
faded, weaker in each of the 
next five villages. So it took 
a total of seven villages to 
wear it out going north, but 
five going south.” He turned and 
stared at Dr. West. 

“In two north camps where 
they had it as bad as we did,” 
the Mountie said, “their radio 
operators both report they no- 
ticed orange cans, mosquito 
spray cans like we’ve been us- 
ing here.” 

/^utside, there was the roar of 
the big medical flying boat 
circling tire harbor for a land- 
ing. 

The Mountie’s face widened 
with relief, and he walked back 
into his radio closet and closed 
the door. 

Dr. West knelt by Eevvaalik’s 
sleeping form. As he lifted her 
wrist to feel her pulse, he knew 
she was dead. 

When the Mountie came out 
of the radio closet, he stared at 
her, then at Dr. West’s drawn 
face. 



GALAXY 



“She’s not the only one dead, 
sir. I didn’t want to disturb you 
before the plane arrived, but 
about a dozen people are dead 
at the camp to the north of us. 
Mostly older people.” 

“The last of the real Eski- 
mos,” Dr. West blurted and felt 
sick, as if not just this Moun- 
tie, but the v/hole world, were 
closing in on him. 

“I think so, sir. I think the 
disease was strongest where the 
spray cans were, sir. Here and 
in the two camps to the north 
where visitors carried mosquito 
spray cans. I’ve had men on 
the look out for cans in the 
other camps, but no sign of 
them. I know the disease is 
mildest in the camps furthest 
away from the cans. You’re a 
doctor. How do you explain 
that, sir?” 

“Probably a bacteria with 
self-attenuating virulency,” Dr. 
West answered with calm des- 
peration. 

“I’ve never heard of that, 
sir.” 



“There’s a lot you haven’t 
heard of!” Then Dr. West man- 
aged to control his voice. “Think 
of microscopic blobs like strings 
of grapes, typical bacteria each 
excreting tissue-destroying poi- 
son as an incidental by-product, 
The toxin is what makes the 
person feel sick. Virulent bac- 
teria, we say.” 

Dr. West stared out the open 
door to the harbor where the 
flying boat had landed; nov/ the 
Mountie had reinforcements. 
“Where was I? Bacteria multi- 
ply so rapidly, a new genera- 
tion every half hour, millions 
of bacteria within a person,” 
Dr. West laughed unexpectedly. 
“There is the possibility of 
hundreds of bacterial mutations. 
Bacteria with slight genetic al- 
terations. Here is the surprising 
thing. A single mutated bacter- 
ium may be “born” which ex- 
cretes less poison and for some 
reason arouses less resistance in 
the body of the person. It and 
its descendants may be able to 
multiply more quickly through

the next few bodies than the 
previous bacteria of its species. 
The mutated bacteria win the 
competition. Bacteria compete 
for living space, too. These less 
virulent but more fertile bac- 
teria squeeze out their old-fash- 
ioned relatives and take over.” 
“From the poisonous ones, 
sir? Like the meek shall inherit 
the earth. Hardly that, sir?” 

“In self-attenuating bacteria 
that is what has happened,” Dr. 
West laughed as if in triumph. 
“The less poisonous had a built- 
in survival advantage. They’ve 
spread through the Esks with 
less and less symptoms, until 
they could infect the world — 
with no noticeable effect.” 

“The bacteria, sir?” The 
Mountie was staring at the map. 
“Surprising to me, sir. The op- 
posite would be so much worse.” 
“You mean more and more 
virulent mutations. For some 
bacteria this does happen. It 
makes no difference to the bac- 
teria as long as multiplication 
proceeds most rapidly.” Dr. 
West watched the airmen walk- 
ing up the beach toward him. 
His voice faded: “Like it or not, 
life’s basic chemical command 
simply is to survive and mul- 
tiply.” 

“It is true there will be too 
many Esks, sir.” The Mountie 
was staring at him. “Is that 
what you’re really thinking?” 

150 



“What do you think? This 
planet was yours first! They’re 
only Esks.” 

“Perhaps, sir, but this is a 
civilized country.” The Moun- 
tie’s eyes scrutinized Dr. West, 
“Are you saying Esks are not 
fully human, sir? Saying things 
like that. Hitler soothed his 
Germans to pop off the Jews, by 
saying — other races . Are 
you saying Esks aren’t human?” 

D r. West retorted: “30-day 

gestation period, and you 
still think Esks are human? 
Those stupid, bearded kooks in 
the L.S.T.,” Dr. West gasped, 
“they are the humans. Stupidly 
feeding a new and competing 
species — Esks. Human? The 
Esks? No, not human unless 
monthly births from each Esk 
woman is a historically human 
characteristic. Mutated humans? 
Hell, no! In an Esk there are 
too damn many neat mutations 
at one time. They aren’t hu- 
man. You are the humanitarian 
idiots bringing food so the Esks 
can multiply until — ” 

“Sir, we can’t let people 
starve! Listen, sir, those bearded 
chaps in the L.S.T., at least 
they obeyed the law and hand- 
ed me approved invoices, lists of 
all the food they brought in. All 
imports approved. That is re- 
quired by law. Look at these 
approved lists on my desk.

Shipping number 334 is for 500 
cartons of prefolded paper dia- 
pers. It is not for a little wooden 
box full of bloody cans of 
MOSQUITO SPRAY!” 

Dr. West looked away as the 
Mountie’s voice rose. 

“The Esks brought the box 
to me.” The Mountie’s voice 
broke as if in pain. “I said, 
open it. How could I know? I 
said, just what I need, mosqui- 
to spray. I took a can. I said, 
you chaps take the rest. Sir, I 
even showed them how to press 
the knob on top to make the 
spray come out. Sir, I didn’t — 
the bloody hell. What was in 
those cans? People died. People 
died.” Mosquitos whined around 
the two men. 

Dr. West’s mouth was so dry 
he couldn’t answer. 

“People died, sir. People died.” 
The Mountie looked down at 
the lump of bedcovers where 
Eevvaalik’s body lay. 

“But you didn’t even get sick. 



sir,” the Mountie blurted. “I 
think you brought those spray 
cans from California, sir. The 
R. C. M. P. will trace them 
back to where they were manu- 
factured. You needn’t speak 
without advice from your coua- 
selor-at-law. Sir — ” The Moun- 
tie’s voice trailed off, and he 
stared out the cabin door. 

The words ARREST and 
MURDER remained unspoken. 
For days they had been flying 
through Dr. West’s consciousness 
like savage-beaked Skuas. Now 
they fell at his feet. The worst 
had happened. There was noth- 
ing more he could do. 

Dr. West’s face twisted in a 
smile of numb relief as the 
cheery pilots and doctors from 
the flying boat blundered into 
the cabin and shook hands all 
around. The Mountie was too 
courteous to mention they were 
shaking hands with a murderer. 
They all sat down and had tea.

■''T^'his time we’re talking about 
four books which not only 
proffer some sort of merit of 
their own but also make some 
representation about the condi- 
tion and progress of science fic- 
tion as a form of literature. Ac- 
cordingly, they’re going to be re- 
viewed not only as things in 
themselves but for their value 
as guides to those who may feel 
they don’t know too much about 
tire field and might consider 
purchasing them in an effort to 
learn something. Or, putting it 
another way, for their value as 
gifts to people whom you would 
like to introduce to the field. 

World’s Best Science Fiction: 
1966, edited by Donald A. Woll- 
heim and Terry Carr (Ace 



Books, is, apposite to Judith 
Merril’s annual anthologies, the 
other respectable and apparently 
regular compilation of what its 
title claims to be. The previous 
or 1965 version in this series has 
even been certified by Miss Mer- 
ril’s crediting some of its con- 
tents for her own book — a 
breathtaking play — and in gen- 
eral was so well received that 
I regretted passing up the oppor- 
tunity to put in my dissenting 
oar at the time. 

There are fifteen selections in 
this current volume, and one is 
at once struck by the thought 
that it was a lean year in which 
only fourteen sf stories published 
in English everywhere in the 
world were better than Harlan 



152 



Ellison’s “ ‘Repent, Harlequin!’ 
Said the Ticktockman”, or, go- 
ing on with the same sort of 
arithmetical negativism, Vernor 
Vinge’s “Apartness” or Joseph 
Green’s “The Decision Makers”, 
Lin Carter’s “Uncollected Works” 
or Christopher Anvil’s “The 
Captive Djinn.” You see where 
arithmetic leads us. An immedi- 
ate third of the contents of this 
book is made up of stories which 
will not on inspection seem to be 
outstanding. 

“Apartness”, “Repent, Harle- 
quin!” and “The Decision Mak- 
ers” share the quality of being 
about solidly acceptable ideas; 
one, that segregation is bad, two, 
that regimentation is bad, three, 
that colonialism is fallacious, 
dangerous and bad. In 1936 
when Leslie Charteris was scor- 
ing off the Establishment in the 
course of telling his Saint stories, 
this was daring stuff in commer- 
cial fiction. But even in 1936, 
it was necessary for potboiler- 
level crime drama to do more 
with the plot than provide an 
occasion for a philosophical point 
to be made. Now, I’m aware 
that there’s a whole generation 
who thinks that this kind of rudi- 
mentary social consciousness is 
deep stuff, but if we are consid- 
ering this book as something to 
show an outsider, chances are he 
will be a bit foozled that these 
primitive statements are consid- 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



ered enough to make an out- 
standing science-fiction story. 
More or less similarly, the Lin 
Carter story is distressingly slight, 
considering what H. G. Wells 
did with “Brownlow’s Newspa- 
per”, and “The Captive Djinn” 
is a technical trickery thing 
about the clever Earthman who 
gets away from the stupid aliens 
who capture him. As you know, 
this piece usually depends on the 
aliens living with so improbable 
a technology that the sophisti- 
cated Earthman is bound to win 
at whatever word length the 
author desires. This particular 
example stacks the cards so 
openly, and so clumsily, that it 
makes a dubious choice for any 
anthology let alone one with 
these pretensions. 

Good, solid science fiction is 
represented in this collection by 
Arthur C. Clarke’s “Sunjam- 
mer”, James H. Schmitz’s “Plan- 
et of Forgetting” and “Masque 
of the Red Shift” by Fred Sa- 
berhagen. These are stories about 
real scientific problems, or at 
least possible real problems that 
could crop up in the future, and 
represent the kind of story which 
justifies the existence of science 
fiction as a distinct genre. Clif- 
ford D. Simak’s “Over the River 
and Through the Woods” is a 
very good example of the kind 
of story no genre minds con- 
tain. Human and warm, 

153 



founded on a genre concept — 
in this case, time travel — it is an 
altogether attractive story with- 
out being a particularly star- 
tling one. And . Larry Niven’s 
“Becalmed in Hell” and, even 
more so, David I. Masson’s 
“Traveler’s Rest” are what I 
think most people will recognize 
as uncommon science-fiction 
stories. In both of them the 
author has created a sense of 
actually having stood at the 
heart of his situation, looked it 
over thoroughly and then 
brought back to us an immedi- 
ate sense of how it feels to, one, 
explore Venus, and, two, live in 
a world of time-distortion. The 
latter is particularly engrossing 
in this respect, and represents 
major talent. 

Finally, Ron Goulart’s “Call- 
ing Dr. Clockwork” and Fritz 
Leiber’s “The Good New Days” 
are founded in our life and times 
as extended into the future, but 
intelligently so ; the Goulart is 
even less of an obvious tilt at 
windmills than the Leiber. Ei- 
ther one of them is head and 
shoulders in sophistication over 
what Happens when some bright 
young man sets out to prove 
that he too has something to 
say. 

It’s not a bad anthology, in 
other words, and contains some 
rewarding moments. Unlike the 
Merril, it does not draw some of 
154 



its “best” selections from sources 
which are not normally directed 
to or supported by science-fic- 
tion readers. But it echoes the 
same taste, loading its contents 
far out of statistical conformity 
to the proportion of inept social 
protest actually published in the 
sf magazines. It doesn’t and 
can’t, therefore, be the “best” of 
science fiction. It can reflect 
what its editors think science 
fiction ought to be, or worse, 
it can be the false face they 
think will most ingratiate the 
field with strangers. This has al- 
ways been a mistake, and I see 
no reason not to think it will be 
a mistake again. 

Orbit 1 (Putnam) is a collec- 
tion of original science-fiction 
stories, edited by Damon Knight 
and introduced with the words 
“Here are the nine best new sci- 
ence-fiction stories I could find 
in eight months of reading man- 
uscripts.” Knight, of course, is 
known to be one of the most 
knowledgeable editors and critics 
in this field, and any such state- 
ment must be followed by an ex- 
emplary compilation, or what’s 
Heaven for? 

And as a matter of fact, these 
are each in its own way attrac- 
tive stories, each with its flash 
of ingenuity, each with its dash 
of charm, or Damon would not 
have liked it. In other words, 

GALAXY 



the Berkley paperback edition 
will be well worth its price. The 
hardcover version meanwhile has 
its troubles with hardcover stan- 
dards. 

What I mean by that inflam- 
matory remark is best inferred 
from the following additional 
quote: “All I had in my mind 
was to try to put together a 
collection of unpublished stories 
good enough to stand beside an 
anthology of classic science fic- 
tion.” That is the standard this 
book does not quite attain, 
though the attempt is brave. 

Three of these stories are 
froth: Allison Rice’s “The Loo- 
lies Are Here,” Sonya Dorman’s 
“Splice of Life,” and Thomas M. 
Disch’s “Five Eggs.” They are 
froth because in treatment or 
theme they are deliberately tri- 
vial; comments on, rather than 
illustrations of, housewife prob- 
lems, hypochrondriac problems, 
and poetaster problems. They are 
well turned out; the Rice is a 
funny thing, “Splice of Life” is 
suitably unsettling, and “Five 
Eggs” does have that moment of 
charm etcetra mentioned above. 
But it seems odd to have it im- 
plied they are one-third of the 
best sf the editor saw in eight 
months. The jacket copy says 
one year. 

Poul Anderson, James Blish, 
and Richard McKenna are each 
represented by exactly the kind 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



of story for which his name is 
recognized and valued. Respec- 
tively, “The Disinherited”, “How 
Beautiful with Banners” and 
“The Secret Place.” McKenna’s 
is about time travel, love and 
maturation. Blish’s is about exo- 
biology, sexuality and intelli- 
gence. Anderson’s is about xen- 
anthropology, politics and moral 
courage. 

I found the Blish a little be- 
wildering, as I sometimes do 
with Blish stories — the author 
seems to have a very clear idea 
of the scientific situation on 
which his plot revolves, and he 
is ruthlessly disciplined in tell- 
ing a story which could occur 
only in that situation, but I 
think there are times when he 
does not let laymen in enough 
on how they would feel if this 
were happening to them, rather 
than to the educated protagon- 
ist. This may or may not be a 
quibble. I’m very much aware 
of the fact that historically this 
is the science fiction. And it’s 
a very well written story, and 
carries something of an emotion- 
al charge. But I get the feeling 
that I’m reading it through a 
sheet of slightly tinted glass, 
and because it nevertheless con- 
veys so much to me, I wish 
there were no barriers at all. I 
may of course be asking Blish 
to be a different author, in which 
case I withdraw the wish. 

155 



In the case of McKenna, I 
think we have a minor story by 
a major writer, and in the case 
of Anderson, we have a kind of 
story which is so hard to write, 
I think, that only Anderson -at- 
tempts it regularly. Only Ander- 
son’s successful attempts provide 
the reference that enables me to 
say this story of the man doing 
the necessary cruel thing, and 
being hated for it, is not as good 
as some others I’ve seen. Never- 
theless, just as we had no one 
better than McKenna for writ- 
ing about masculine love, and we 
have no one better than Blish 
for writing hard stories of phys- 
ical science, we have no one 
better than Anderson for writ- 
ing about intelligent motivations 
in the historical future. So to this 
extent, modified by these judg- 
ments on these individual exam- 
ples, these three are representa- 
tive of the best that science fic- 
tion can do in each of these 
three of the many kinds of 
science fiction. 

Another common type of sci- 
ence fiction is the kind con- 
cerned with the places where we 
will live. One of the older con- 
ventional places is within an ex- 
isting larger galactic empire to 
which we are newcomers, and in 
this type Kate Wilhelm’s “Star- 
es Flonderans” is a pretty good 
example of thinking, in the sense 
that she has concerned herself 
156 



with a very real possible prob- 
lem. However, this is the kind 
of story in which all the char- 
acters are mouthpieces, discuss- 
ing some inexplicable mystery of 
vital importance to them, while 
actually performing no actions. 
What action does occur is scene- 
setting by the author, who pro- 
vides, at intervals, visible illus- 
trations of that same mystery. 
Forward progress thus is zero. 
Finally the author pushes a cou- 
ple of new characters and some 
additional scenery on stage; thus 
the actual nature of the prob- 
lem is revealed, and what you 
suddenly realize is that the story 
that ought to have started there, 
and arisen from it, is thus lost. 
It was good thinking, nice think- 
ing, but now another attempt 
will have to be made. 

Keith Roberts’s “The Deeps” 
is about people living beneath 
the sea, a fairly new — or at least 
newly rediscovered — locale. Rob- 
erts’s treatment of it is extreme- 
ly effective; the enchantment of 
‘the deeps,’ the undercurrent of 
tension and fear that prolonged 
diving brings to those of us who 
attain maturity on land, our in- 
credulous observation of the nat- 
ural ease with which our chil- 
dren take to it and find entirely 
different fascinations in it, thus 
disquieting us more than if we 
ourselves found only revulsion — 
all these things are in this story. 

GALAXY 



This brings us to the special 
case of Virginia Kidd, who, as 
this book tells us, was formerly 
married to James Blish and col- 
laborated with him on many 
stories and novels published un- 
der his byline. In “Kangaroo 
Court”, one does find many of 
the devices and approaches 
which are typical of a Blish 
story, as well as a quality of 
competence and self-trust which 
is accepted as a matter of 
course in work signed by an es- 
tablished name. In this unique 
context, it shows up as what we 
would call “daring” in a new 
writer. In other words, there is 
evident knowledge that there are 
things you should leave out as 
well as things you must put in. 

“Kangaroo Court” is about 
marsupial aliens who return to 
Earth to check on the progress 
of a colony they planted on this 
planet millenia ago. By introduc- 
ing the fact that the aliens 
travel by an experimental fast- 
er-than-light ship, and that rela- 
tive to them the colony was 
planted only a few months ago, 
the author in one swoop accom- 
plishes the introduction of a 
great many potent story-turns. 
The aliens must face the fact 
that the planet now belongs to 
autochthonous mammals. We in 
turn have to face the fact that 
all unbeknownst to us we have 
been containing and abrading a 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



large chunk of an alien ecology 
and have in a sense participated 
in the final stages of its decay to 
sub-intelligent levels. 

However, as in the Blish story, 
there is a sense of the last-act 
performers being conscious of a 
four-alarm fire backstage. There 
is also the immediate appearance 
of a villain whose villainy is pret- 
ty much unmotivated except in 
terms of cliche. He is a one-view- 
point man without past or future 
— a fetish dropped from the sky 
to worry the three-dimensional 
characters. Too, the narrative 
pacing is bad — there either 
needs to be more buildup to- 
ward the ending or, perhaps 
preferably, less detail before- 
hand, so that the need for a 
tacked-on trip to Australia does 
not arise. The actual story all 
takes place aboard the landed 
alien spaceship where marsupial 
and mammal sit in deliberation 
over the two viewpoints on the 
situation. Even so, this is very 
nearly a major story, by an un- 
doubtedly important writer, rep- 
resenting a definite gain to the 
field. 

What Damon Knight has put 
together here, then, is a book 
that represents science fiction 
well but not to any extraordin- 
ary extent. He has come up 
with some solid stories, some 
well written trifling stories, and 
one or two uncommon stories, 

157 



though none that ring so well as 
to be clearly and obviously the 
“best” of anything. 

The question then follows nat- 
urally: Am I perhaps asking too 
much when I suggest as strongly 
as I do that a “best” story pro- 
claim itself outstanding not only 
in relation to its immediate com- 
pany but in relation to all sci- 
ence-fiction writing? Well, on the 
face of it, I’m asking it to do 
more than its editors strictly 
promise. But whatever the right 
or wrong of this matter, there 
have clearly been stories and 
writers that have been respon- 
sible for the shape of this field, 
in the sense that they have un- 
covered for us new possibilities 
in the craft and new areas into 
which the general body of this 
field might advance. This sense 
of progression, this feeling that 
there is indeed a quality of in- 
trinsic excellence which reveals 
itself without regard to relative 
merits, possesses many of us, I 
think. Sometimes in fits and 
starts, sometimes as a source of 
general compulsion toward a 
half-realized ideal. Being what it 
is, it frequently takes on the 
tones of intransigent frustration 
and makes us sound very grum- 
py indeed when we call for its 
evocation. 

And thus we segue naturally 
into two books created by Sam 
Moskowitz. 

158 



These are Seekers of Tomor- 
row and Modern M'asterpieces 
of Science Fiction, released si- 
multaneously by World. Seek- 
ers of Tomorrow is a compilation 
of Moskowitz’s short biographies 
of science-fiction writers. Mod- 
ern Masterpieces of Science Fic- 
tion is an anthology of stories by 
those same writers. Taken to- 
gether, they represent an item 
of scholarship and dedication, 
and a potential keystone for any 
understanding of the field on the 
part of someone lately come to 
it. 

Moskowitz is a master of de- 
notation. He will find a fact hid- 
den from all other unaided eyes 
at a distance of a hundred yards, 
and he will write it down. In 
preparing these volumes for pub- 
lication, he states that he reread 
“the entire science-fiction out- 
put of every science fiction writ- 
er discussed ... As a prelude to 
writing this book, every science 
fiction magazine containing or- 
iginal material ever published in 
the English language was col- 
lected (as well as hundreds in 
foreign languages), and thou- 
sands of the key books, bulletins, 
newspaper clippings and related 
items were assembled. Quite lit- 
erally, it took thirty years of 
reading and collecting to make 
the writing of this book possi- 
ble.” This from the introduction 
to Seekers of Tomorrow, which 

GALAXY 



contains biographies of Edward 
E. Smith, John W. Campbell, 
Edmond Hamilton, Jack Wil- 
liamson, Murray Leinster, John 
Wyndham, Eric Frank Russell, 
L. Sprague De Camp, Lester del 
Rey, Robert A. Heinlein, A. E. 
van Vogt, Theodore Sturgeon, 
Isaac Asimov, Clifford D. Sim- 
ak, Fritz Leiber, C. L. Moore, 
Henry Kuttner, Robert Bloch, 
Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clark, 
Philip Jose Farmer and Mort 
Weisinger. (Mr. Weisinger’s 
name was entered here out of 
order by the reviewer). 

There is only one name here 
that one could really cavil with, 
though I think both Fred Pohl 
and Cyril Kornbluth might have 
had more extensive inclusion. 
The biographies are very inter- 
esting, and certainly contain a 
number of uncommon facts 
which tend to explain the indi- 
vidual creative approaches of 
these writers. There may be 
times when Moskowitz’s ap- 
proach, in his introductions, in 
the biographies and in his gener- 
al treatment, infuriates you, as 
when he refers to John Camp- 
bell’s “deluded” readers, or says 
that Jack Williamson “got more 
than he bargained for” after 
making a considerable effort to 
get into World War II. You 
must remember that Moskowitz 
is a master of denotation. He 
wouldn’t know a connotation if 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



it snapped at his ankle, which is 
something that happens quite 
often. 

Moskowitz’s personal approach 
leads to other easily visible at- 
tributes, some of which are a 
real pleasure to argue with, 
as when he says the T. S. Strib- 
ling’s “The Green Splotches” is 
a story about an atomic -powered 
space rocket. Well, it isn’t. It’s 
a story about green splotches. 
But it is true that the fake Ce- 
sare Ruano was mining radium, 
though his spaceship seemed to 
react sharply to light-pressure, 
thus making it obviously the 
place where Arthur C. Clarke 
found the idea for “Sunjammer.” 

As you might gather, Mosko- 
witz’s approach to the history 
and evolution of this field is this 
“tune detective” approach. A dif- 
fusionist if there ever was one, 
he is concerned with tracing ev- 
ery story ever published to its 
origin in half a phrase thrown 
away in a story by Miles J. 
Breuer, which story itself of 
course is based on a paragraph 
in S. P. Meek. That anyone ever 
got an idea from some place oth- 
er than a previous story found in 
an earlier issue in the Mosko- 
witz complete collection is not 
allowed even as a theoretical 
talking point, and each such 
structure of investigation is based 
on assertion of impeccable re- 
search. Thus it is with glee that 

159 



one discovers such boo-boos as 
the claim that Robert Heinlein 
wrote a story called “Delilah 
and the Spacemen’s Rigger” or 
that Steven Vincent Benet is the 
author of something called “By 
the Place of the Gods.” When 
he confuses Arthur C. Clarke’s 
“Loophole” with another story, 
he is clearly making a mistake 
of his own, rather than being 
blamed for the very bad proof- 
reading which abets the less fre- 
quent lapses in his nevertheless 
impressive memory. 

Make no mistake about it — 
quibbling aside, Moskowitz 
knows, and transmits, at least as 
much about the history of sci- 
ence fiction and its evolution, as 
anyone possibly could. Though 
his bias is not the common bias 
and is therefore easily visible, 
his bias is probably no stronger 
than anyone else’s would be. 
There is an incredible amount of 
love and patience embodied in 
these books. The idea of the two 
books as a device for telling us 
a great deal about the writers, 
the stories and the forces which 
add up to “modern” science fic- 
tion is ■ a stunner. A few people 
might have gotten all of this 
together in their heads, but I 
cannot imagine anyone else who 
would have gotten it out on pa- 
per, and for that reason alone 
Moskowitz has fulfilled his func- 
tion and his ambition, though 
160 



not as flawlessly as he might 
like or might assert. Neverthe- 
less he has done the humanly 
possible, which as you know is 
sometimes incredibly difficult to 
do. 

The stories contained in Mod- 
ern Masterpieces of Science Fic- 
tion are: “The Vortex Blasters”, 
“Night”, “A Logic Named Joe”, 
“Requiem” (the good story of 
Edmond Hamilton), “With Fold- 
ed Hands”, “Adaptation”, “The 
Witness”, “The Command”, 
“Kindness”, “We Also Walk 
Dogs”, “The Enchanted Village”, 
“Liar!”, “Microcosmic God”, 
“Huddling Place”, “Coming At- 
traction”, “Doorway into Time”, 
“We Guard the Black Planet!”, 
“The Strange Flight of Richard 
Clayton”, “Wake for the Liv- 
ing”, “Before Eden” and “Moth- 
er”, I think that with the ex- 
ception of the Hamilton “Requi- 
em” (as distinguished from Hein- 
lein’s good story of the same 
name), there are few stories here 
which need the author’s byline 
conjoined with them to be im- 
mediately recognizable. They are 
not always the obvious stories — 
for example, one would not or- 
dinarily mention “Metamorpho- 
site” when speaking of Eric 
Frank Russell and then run 
“The Witness” instead — but 
on the other hand I’m very glad 
to see “A Logic Named Joe.” 

In addition, as you’ve gath- 
GALAXY 



ered, Moskowitz includes much 
matter on stories and writers not 
given the full treatment. I think, 
everything taken in its place, 
provided you could not get hold 
of a copy of Adventures in Time 
and Space (in the first edition) 
you could do a lot worse in rep- 
resenting the field than to pass 
out a copy of Modern Master- 
pieces of Science Fiction, which 
despite the promise of the jacket 
does gain considerably by con- 
taining no contribution from the 
earnest Mr. Weisinger, whose bi- 
ography in Seekers of Tomorrow 



will justify whatever evil one 
might care to think of him. Or 
haven’t you read any Superman 
D.S. publications lately? I have. 
As for Seekers of Tomorrow tak- 
■en as a whole, there is no other 
book like it. If you’re at aU in- 
terested in this field to the ex- 
tent of wanting to know some- 
thing about who writes it and 
why, you have, got to have it. 
You have to have Moskowitz 
with it, but that’s not as bad as 
it may sound. The field is full 
of opinionated people, or haven’t 
you noticed? -AL/GIS BUDRYS 



REMEMBER DIANETiCS? 



Sixteen years ago, a book was published which predicted the appearance of 
Homo Novis, the next spectacular, upward leap in man's evolution. It 
blazed the trail through the confusions and misunderstandings about the 
nature of man and his mind to make the achievement possible by pre- 
senting the thoroughly researched and precise technology for clearing the 
mind of the unknowns that caused man's aberrative behavior. That book 
is DIANETICS, THE MODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH by L. 
Ron Hubbard. 

In those sixteen years, all over the world in the organizations of Scien- 
tology, millions of people have been steadily and quietly moving up toward 
that high state of being known as CLEAR. 

And so, now, the men of the future are already among us, hard at work 
building the civilization of tomorrow. 

They are coming out of Saint Hill in England. They are the men who 
no longer have a reactive mind. They are the masters of themselves and 
their environment. They are the Clears. 

You can be one of them. Order the book, DIANETICS, THE MODERN 
SCIENCE OP MENTAL HEALTH, and discover the way to your own in- 
credible future.

PLANET 

of 

FAKERS 

by j. T. McIntosh 

Illustrated by McCLANE 



They didn't wear clothes because they 
didn't dare — and for the sarhe reason 
they could never hope to return home! 



I 

tfVText, please,” Stevens call- 
^ ed, and the guard at the 
door opened it. 

The small, tubby man who 
entered was frightened out of his 
wits. He was also naked. But 
then, so was Stevens, so were 



the two guards, so were Evans 
and Anna and Jonina. He wasn’t 
the odd man out. 

“Hammett, isn’t it?” said 
Stevens, picking up his steth- 
oscope. 

“Yes, sir.” Even Hammett’s 
eyebrows were shivering. 

“Don’t worry,” Stevens said 



162 



mildly. “If you’re okay, you’ve 
nothing to worry about. If you’re 
a Faker — ” 

“I’m me, sir,” said Hammett 
earnestly. Jonina came to draw 
a blood sample from his arm, 
and at one and the same time he 
tried to look at her and not look 
at her. Some of the older people, 
even after a month of total nudi- 
ty all the time everywhere, still 
hadn’t gotten used to it and nev- 
er would. 

“Well, that’s what we’re go- 
ing to find out,” said Stevens. 

“You don’t use pincers now, 
do you?” Hammett asked ap- 
prehensively. 

“No, that doesn’t work any 
more.” 

“And no . survival tests, like 
holding a guy’s head under wa- 
ter?” 

“They don’t work any more 
either.” 

“And no ... ” involuntarily 
he glanced at Jonina, who was 
withdrawing the needle, and in- 
stantly looked away as embar- 
rassed as if he’d been caught 
looking through a keyhole “ . 
no . sex?” 

“That worked for only two 
days,” Stevens sighed. 

Hammett looked slightly re- 
lieved, but only slightly. 

It was no use listening to the 
little man’s heart, really, for if he 
was a Faker he could make it 
race exactly as it was doing. All 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



the same, as a doctor, Stevens 
liked to form an impression from 
a long list of symptoms — and 
the fact that Hammett’s heart 
sounded as it did went with the 
fact that Hammett reacted as he 
did when Jonina bent over him 
to make it a little less likely that 
he was a Faker. The blood tests 
weren’t much use either, yet if 
the Fakers had got Hammett in 
the last hour or two, the blood 
sediment rate would be signifi- 
cant. They could take over the 
body and the brain instantly, but 
the blood had a will of its own. 

' I ■'he detection team tried doz- 
ens of brief tests on Ham- 
mett, shot questions at him and 
examined his brainwaves — in 
short, they ran a random sam- 
ple of tests which had caught 
Fakers out in the past. 

They were fully aware, how- 
ever, that the most useless thing 
they could do was use tests which 
had previously caught Fakers 
out . 

Evans, who had been working 
at the other end of the clinic on 
a set of answers from Hammett, 
suddenly thought of something 
and waddled back to the group. 
Evans, the oldest of the tec team, 
was pale and paunchy and not 
enthusiastic about Operation 
Birthday Suit. If, like Stevens 
and the two girls, you were 
young and slim and well-formed, 

163 



you still might not like it — but 
you had less reason positively to 
dislike it, Evans considered. 

“Thought of something, Tom?” 
Stevens said hopefully. 

Evans nodded and asked 
Hammett: “Who was Black 

Beauty?” 

“Black Beauty?” Hammett 
echoed blankly. 

The two girls, both working 
on samples, stopped and turned 
to look at Hammett, who had 
gone pale and looked, if any- 
thing, even more frightened. 

“Good question, Tom,” Stev- 
ens commented. “Well, Ham- 
mett?” 

The little man licked his lips. 
“The Mona Lisa?” he said. 
“Some dame in a poem? A play?” 

The atmosphere in the clinic 
changed. 

“Just wait in there, Hammett, 
will you?” Stevens said, point- 
ing to one of the soundproof 
cells which had been construct- 
ed out of the former changing 
cubicles. 

Hammett went so pale that 
scars unsuspected before, showed 
on his face. “For Pete’s sake. 
Doctor,” he begged, “don’t do 
anything rash. I’m me, I tell 
you — ” 

“We’ll find out,” Stevens said 
evenly. 

One of the guards pushed the 
little man into a cell and made 
sure the door was properly shut. 
164 



“Funny,” Jonina said. “Noth- 
ing medical or scientific works. 
This blood is just ordinary hu- 
man blood. Yet a simple little 
question like that works — ” 

“I don’t really think he’s a 
Faker,” Stevens said. 

“Neither do I,” said Anna. 

\ nna was small and dark, Jo- 
nina tall and blonde. Jonina 
was a nurse, and Anna a physi- 
cist. Jonina looked twenty-one 
and was in fact eighteen. Anna 
looked eighteen and was actually 
twenty-four. She was unofficially 
engaged to Stevens. 

“I’m not so sure,” said Jonina 
thoughtfully. “When I was 
standing over him just now and 
he made like a shy middle-aged 
adolescent, I got the idea it must 
be an act. Seemed a bit overdone 
... I guess it might be worth 
having him back and trying the 
temptress routine. I’m game, 
though he’s rather a repulsive 
little man . Anna?” 

Anna shrugged. 

“Nothing that stops working 
ever works again,” Stevens said. 
“But we’ve nothing to lose.” He 
nodded to the guards, and they 
brought Hammett back. 

“Doctor,” he croaked. “I’m not 
much of a reader, see, not an 
educated man . Whoever Black 
Beauty is, I guess you know all 
about her, but not everybody 
knows as much as you. I mean, 

GALAXY 



it could be a dame or coal or a 
black diamond or ” 

He stopped as Jonina put her 
arms round him. 

The team, and most of the vic- 
tims, had elected to treat this 
sort of thing as comedy. Of 
course, it ceased to be funny 
when Fakers were caught this 
way. But the rest of the time . 
well, anything went if you could 
treat it as pure farce. 

Anna joined in, and they made 
smoke blow out of the little 
man’s ears. But he didn’t think 
it was fun. He was sick with em- 
barrassment. It was a moment 
of exquisite relief for him when 
he was allowed to go back to 
his cell. 

“Well?” said Stevens. 

“Yes,” said Jonina. 

“No,” said Anna, at the same 
time. 

Then they started to argue. 
No man could really be that 
way, Jonina said. He was exag- 
gerating. Anna said Jonina was 
just a kid and when she was a 
little older and had a little more 
experience with men, she’d know 
they could be any way. Jonina 
said well maybe Anna would 
know about that, but when she 
necked with a man, any man, she 
expected a lot more genuine un- 
inhibited male reaction. Anna, 
refusing to be drawn, asked cool- 
ly how often Jonina necked with 
little fat men old enough to be 

PLANET OF FAKERS 



her father and how often she 
thought Hammett in the last fif- 
teen years had had two naked 
girls trying to seduce him. 

“Break it up, girls,” Stevens 
sighed. “Let’s leave him there for 
a while and finish this batch.” To 
the guard at the door he said: 
“Next, please.” 

A skinny youth entered. “Who 
is Black Beauty?” Stevens shot 
at him. 

The youth blinked. “A horse 
in a kids’ story. A horse that — ” 

“Okay. You can go.” 

Surprised, because these tests 
could take hours, the youth went 
out. 

The other three were surprised 
too. “Taking a chance, aren’t 
you?” said Evans. “We don’t 
know that the Fakers don’t know 
about Black Beauty. They could 
easily — ” 

“I want to try that question 
on as many people as possible 
before the Fakers find the an- 
swer. In half an hour it’ll be 
useless. If Hammett is a Faker, 
they already know the question, 
and in two minutes they’ll have 
the answer. Even if he isn’t, the 
news will be all over the colony 
that we’re asking about Black 
Beauty — ” 

“We could tell everybody not 
to breathe a word of it,” said 
Jonina. 

Stevens smiled wryly. “That 
would be as good as a broadcast. 

165 



Next, please,” he said quietly. 

II 

'^he guard opened the door 
again. A girl came in, a 
small girl rather like Anna. 

“Sonia?” said Stevens. He 
couldn’t remember her surname. 

“That’s right.” She was not 
nervous. She smiled at Jonina 
and Anna, who did not smile 
back. 

Again Stevens decided in the 
first seconds that he was not 
dealing with a Faker. Sonia was 
enjoying herself, enjoying being 
the center of attention. She had 
a moderately pretty face that 
would not, a month ago, have 
attracted much notice in the 
domed city. But she had the fig- 
ure for Operation Birthday Suit 

“Just one question, Sonia,” 
said Stevens, and asked it. 

The girl grinned. “If I weren’t 
so modest, I’d say it could be 
me,” she observed. 

“Now the right answer,” said 
Stevens patiently. 

“Well I’ll be polite and say 
Anna here.” 

“Quit stalling.” 

“Black Beauty?” 

Stevens nodded to the guard. 

Sonia not only protested, she 
tried to fight. Anna, who didn’t 
like her and made no secret 
about it, chopped her hard on 
166 



the back of the neck, and after 
that she was bundled into a sec- 
ond cell with no trouble. 

“But she’s not a Faker,” Anna 
said when the door was closed. 
“She’s a louse, but not a Fak- 
er.” 

“Don’t kids read about Black 
Beauty any more?” Stevens said, 
frowning. “Is it a dud question?” 

“No,” said Evans, Anna and 
Jonina, more or less together. 

“Next, please,” said Stevens. 

The youth who entered was 
rather between Hammett and 
Sonia in attitude. He was ner- 
vous, and yet he was excited too. 
This regular examination was 
the biggest thing in the lives of 
the 316 Procarpan colonists at 
the moment. It was, quite liter- 
ally, a matter of life and death. 
They feared it and felt a mighty 
relief when it was over once 
again. But it also, in a macabre 
way, gave some of the colonists 
a terrific kick to pass the test, 
to prove they were human. 

R ight away Stevens said: 
“Who is Black Beauty?” 

“A horse,” said the youth. “A 
horse that drew a London cab, 
and — ” 

“Okay,” said Stevens. “You 
can go.” 

After he had gone, the other 
three looked at him in doubt. 
Relying on a single question was 
a big gamble. 



GALAXY 



Answering their unspoken 
question, Stevens said: “He’s a 
technician. He has skills that 
can’t be picked up in a few 
weeks. If he were a Faker, he’d 
be found out in a couple of 
hours.” 

Evans still looked doubtful. 
“We can’t afford to cut cor- 
ners, Steve.” 

“We can’t afford not to. We’ve 
got three hundred ten to keep 
testing. We haven’t caught a 
Faker in a week — and if the 
past record is anything to go 
by, there must be about half a 
dozen new Fakers in that time, 
not counting any we might have 
missed before. I guess we may 
have to skip the people we know 
aren’t Fakers, like us six and the 
Director and the technicians and 
engineers, and concentrate for a 
while on the unskilled . Right, 
next, guard.” 

“That’s the lot,” said the 
guard. 

“We’ll have Hammett back, 
then.” 

It had seemed, when Hammett 
first came in, that he couldn’t 
possibly be more scared. But that 
had been proved wrong. Fright 
had become fear, then terror, and 
now absolute desperation. 

“All right,” said Stevens, “you 
can go.” 

Hammett scuttled out before 
he could change his mind. 

“Why the heck did you let him 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



go?” Jonina demanded. She was 
ruffled — she was the one who 
had said he might well be a 
Faker. 

“They don’t know human ter- 
ror,” Stevens said. “If he were 
a Faker, he couldn’t act like that 
because he wouldn’t know how. 
Fakers have experienced a lot 
of things here, but not — ” 
“You’re wrong, Steve,” said 
Evans quietly. “What about the 
people taken over by Fakers?” 
Could there be greater fear?” 
Jonina shuddered, but Stevens 
was unimpressed. “It’s quick. Us- 
ually they don’t even see the 
white worm. If they do, they 
either manage to kill it or they 
run. If they run, they’re either 
caught in a second or they es- 
cape. What the Fakers see is not 
suspense terror, but escape ter- 
ror. Hammett didn’t look the 
way a man would look when 
trapped by a worm.” 

Evans nodded slowly. 

Qonia was brought out. She was 
still annoyed, but confident 
now. “You might have given me 
a chance,” she protested. “Black 
Beauty — sure, a horse. A horse 
in kids’ books.” 

Stevens made a gesture, Anna 
screamed, the nearest guard 
brought up his gun and fired. 
Sonia collapsed like an empty 
sack, dead before she started to 
fall. 



167 



“Well, well,” said Evans in a 
hushed tone. “I hope you knew 
what you were doing, Steve.” 

“She wasn’t a Faker, Arthur,” 
Anna whispered. She was the 
only person in the colony who 
called Stevens Arthur. Every- 
body else called him Steve, ex- 
cept when linking him with 
Evans. Then they were Stevens 
and Evans. 

“Let’s just wait, huh?” said 
Stevens, curt with her for once. 

They aU stared down at the 
body on the floor. The gun the 
guard had used killed instantly 
but without any visible injury. 
Apart from her crumpled posi- 
tion, the girl on the floor might 
merely have been asleep. 

They scarcely moved for ten 
minutes. They were all, includ- 
ing the two guards, remembering 
that three of the people destroy- 
ed as Fakers had not been Fak- 
ers at all . 

At last, to the immense relief 
of all of them, the faint green 
tinge that proved she was a 
Faker began to appear under 
the girl’s skin. 

“Give that to the lab boys,” 
Stevens said, indicating the 
corpse. The guards carried it 
out. 

“Well, you spotted her — but 
how?” said Evans. 

“When she went into the cubi- 
cle, she just didn’t know who 
Black Beauty was. Some things 
168 



you forget temporarily, like a 
name or an address — but if you 
know Black Beauty was a horse, 
you don’t forget that. If you do, 
you don’t suddenly remember 
it.” 

“So what happened?” 

Stevens face went grim. “A 
Faker among us went to the li- 
brary. Or found out from some- 
body in the colony. I’m going 
to see the Director about that 
now.” 

Ill 

'"X^he Director was working on 
-*■ a chess problem when Stev- 
ens walked in on him. Like 
everyone else he was stark nak- 
ed, even in his private room. 

“Well, Steve?” the Director 
asked. 

“Caught one,” Stevens said. 

“Good. About time,” said the 
Director pleasantly. “Who have 
we lost?” 

“Girl called Sonia. I don’t re- 
member her other name.” 

“I know her. Small, dark. Poor 
kid. Did you send the corpse to 
the labs?” 

“Of course.” 

“Good. One of these days 
they’ll turn up something. 
They’re asking for a live Faker, 
by the way.” 

Stevens pursed his lips. “When 
we find Fakers, we don’t dare 
do anything but blast them. 

GALAXY 



That way we kill any extra 
worms they’re carrying. Besides, 
their strength — ” 

“I know, I know. You could 
strap suspects in chairs before 
starting the tests, couldn’t you?” 
“That wouldn’t stop the worms 
coming out if they saw a chance. 
Director, there’s something I 
want done right away.” He ex- 
plained the Black Beauty test 
and added: “I’ve been to the 
library. There isn’t a copy of the 
book, and I couldn’t find a men- 
tion in any of the encyclopedias, 
except under Sewell — and that 
would be no use to anyone who 
didn’t know where to look in 
the first place.” 

“So?” 

“So some Faker among us 
asked somebody.” 

“And you want to spot the 
Faker. Right.” He turned to tlie 
intercom and gave orders. An 
immediate exhaustive check was 
to be made. Who had asked 
whom about Black Beauty? The 
orders made it clear, in case any- 
one thought he might be buying 
trouble, that nobody was inter- 
ested in the person who had 
{inswered the question — only in 
the person who had 'asked. 

When he had finished giving 
the orders, the Director turned 
back to Stevens. “Any ideas 
about tlieir method of communi- 
cation yet?” he asked. “The lab 
boys swear it isn’t telepathy.” 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



S tevens shook his head. “All 
any of us can guess is that 
it’s an extra sense we can’t con- 
ceive . suppose a certain race 
had never had hearing, they’d 
wonder how we could communi- 
cate. They’d notice we moved 
our lips and work on the possi- 
bility that we were using a kind 
of sign language. But then they’d 
find that we didn’t have to look 
at a person’s lips to get the 
message — ” 

“What kind of sense would 
work in a soundproof, lightproof, 
radiationproof room? The lab 
boys insist no telepathic waves 
could get through that shield- 
ing.” 

Stevens shrugged. “We know 
it happens. Anything any Faker 
knows, learns, can do, every other 
Faker instantly knows, has 
learned, can do. That’s why it 
gets harder and harder to spot 
them . Director, can’t we drop 
Operation Birthday Suit? It isn’t 
helping any more, and in some 
ways it’s hindering — ” 

“How?” 

“Well, though the young peo- 
ple soon get used to it, the old- 
er folks don’t. They tend to seek 
privacy. They stay alone as 
much as possible. And that’s just 
playing into the Faker’s hands. 
Besides, nakedness means every 
inch of all of us is vulnerable 
all the time, and a worm mere- 
ly has to get close enough to 

169 



strike — through the ground 
straight into bare feet maybe — ” 

“Clothes never gave any pro- 
tection. They don’t need bare 
skin. They can strike through 
anything.” 

“Okay, forget that point if 
you like.” 

The Director thought for a 
moment and then shook his 
head. “No,” he said. “We can’t 
drop it. We know that the Fak- 
ers used to carry spare worms 
under their clothes, on their 
sjtin, in their pockets. Now 
worms have to emerge from the 
body, and that takes time. May- 
be not much time, but still time. 
Another thing is, you know a 
Faker who has just taken over 
doesn’t move quite right, the 
muscles jump, there’s a flush — 
we’ve spotted seven that way, 
remember.” 

“But only one in the last three 
weeks,” Stevens argued. “I think 
they’ve beaten that too — ” 

“How?” 

“Well, obviously when a worm 
strikes and flows into a human 
body, there must be conflict for 
a time — minutes if not hours. 
Although the brain seems to be 
blotted out instantly, the body 
fights on longer. The blood fights 
longest of all — we calculate that 
seven hours after substitution, 
the BSR is still significantly 
high. But the Fakers have long 
since found how to keep this con- 
170 



flict masked. They stop the 
flush, force the muscles to relax, 
and any internal fight that’s go- 
ing on proceeds without visible 
sign.” 

'"T^he Director nodded slowly. 

“Maybe, maybe. But we 
stay in the buff. You won’t shift 
me, Steve. In overalls a single 
Faker could carry enough worms 
to take over a whole dormitory 
before the guards could do a 
thing. Naked, on your own esti- 
mate, Fakers can’t carry more 
than two or three spare worms.” 
Stevens nodded grudgingly. 
“Another thing, then — don’t 
you think the library should be 
closed? Sure, it’s shutting the sta- 
ble door after the horse has bolt- 
ed, but take the present case . 
If we ask a question that catch- 
es Fakers, all the others have to 
do is go to the library and find 
the answer.” 

“There are three girls check- 
ing everybody who uses the li- 
brary and when, Steve.” 

“Sure, but we’ve never yet 
caught a Faker that way. At tiie 
same time, the availability of the 
library means — ” 

“No, Steve,” said the Director 
definitely. “The library has to 
remain open for about half our 
personnel an5rway — you, your 
staff, the scientists, the recorders. 
I can’t see that closing it to the 
others, which would be very diffi- 

GALAXY 



cult administratively, would 
make much difference.” 

Stevens nodded even more 
grudgingly. “I have to get back,” 
he said. “There’s another batch 
lined up by this time.” 

“Goes on all the time, doesn’t 
it? Steve, any suggestions you’ve 
got. I’ll listen.” 

What in hell’s the good of lis- 
tening and then saying no? Stev- 
ens thought but didn’t say. Not 
for the first time, another 
thought formed in his mind; The 
Director always had perfectly 
good reasons for doing the wrong 
thing, but with some other man 
in charge of the Procarpan dome 
colony, tlie Faker problem might 
well have been beaten long since. 

Stevens made one more try: 
“Well, why can’t we make one 
big room somehow and all live 
in it? That way the Fakers 
could never get at anybody on 
their own — ” 

The Director was shaking his 
head again. “Our materials are 
cruelly limited. We have noth- 
ing but what we landed with. 
Steve, what nobody is ever go- 
ing to understand when we get 
back — if we get back — is that 
in this colony there’s just no 
way of stopping Faker worms 
getting at people. Crowding 
everybody together would mere- 
ly help them to take over scores 
of people quickly, silently, in- 

PLANET OF FAKERS 



stead of the odd one now and 
then. We can’t send people 
round in twos or threes or fours, 
because if half of them are Fak- 
ers, we’re simply sentencing the 
other half. The only weapon that 
really works is the guns, and the 
best use we can make of them 
is to give them to guards who 
patrol the whole area, search for 
worms and take note when two 
people come too close . .” 

He stopped and added rather 
irritably: “Surely your job is 
more vital than anything I can 
do? If you could only find a 
simple, quick, infallible test that 
would show whether any man or 
woman was possessed or not — ” 
“Quite,” Stevens retorted. “If 
only you hadn’t been in such 
a hurry to teach the Fakers 
everything we know, it would 
have been easy. As it is, it’s get- 
ting close to impossible.” 

Giving the Director no oppor- 
tunity to answer, he strode out. 

IV 

T eft on his own, the Director 
' put the chessboard aside and 
thought for a moment. Had he 
made mistakes? Was he still 
making them? 

Well, obviously, mistakes had 
been made in the beginning. But 
how could they have been avoid- 
ed, save by second sight? 



171 



The Director liked to think 
on paper. He drew a pad toward 
him and wrote: 

I still feel that though this is 
probably the most desperate and 
horrifying situation any group of 
people have ever faced, there 
must be a simple solution -which 
we are missing. 

He read through what he had 
written, tore it up and started 
again: 

When we came, we set up a 
settlement by standard procedure. 
The ship was left in orbit, sealed 
and unmanned, and we all came 
do-wn in the tenders. The air, 
though temporarily breathable, 
kills in twenty-four hours, so first 
we set up the Standard Poisonous 
Atmospheres Dome. Then we dis- 
mantled five of the tenders, seal- 
ed the sixth, and set up a stand- 
ard colony within the SPAD. 

The floor of the dome was 
soft earth. We have not yet 
found rock or stone on Procarpa. 
Perhaps that is the real cause of 
the trouble. 

It was assumed, as it always is, 
that we’d use local material. We 
brought all we actually need, in- 
cluding food and prefabricated 
living accommodations. However, 
in the usual course of events a 
settlement such as this would 
gradually have been transformed 
by the use of local raw materials, 
wood, stone, -rock or metal. Per- 
manent buildings would be erect- 
ed, the floor inside the dome 
172 



would be paved, and so on. 

But in our early days, all the 
■work was done inside the dome, 
and only occasional scouting par- 
ties went out to explore. They 
found no rock in the -vicinity, no 
living creatures except plants, and 
the trees of Procarpa are too 
small, thin and sappy to be of 
much use as a building material. 

Then came the Fakers — and 
now we dare not send parties 
outside the dome. The last that 
were sent did not return. 

Could Stevens be right? Was 
it all his fault? Definitely not, 
the Director decided firmly. 
When humans met an entirely 
unknown form of life, it mi^t 
prove in the end that the best 
thing they could have done was 
shoot on sight. But that didn’t 
mean they should always shoot 
on sight. Obviously not. He 
wrote : 

After weeks of preliminary 
work we were utterly astonished 
when one day a man appeared — 
outside the dome. If he had worn 
a mask, if he had been humanoid, 
if he had even been signific.antly 
different from us, his appearance 
would not have cau.sed such a 
sensation. 

The startling thing was that as 
far as we could see he was ex- 
actly like us, and wearing clothes 
the same as ours. 

We let him in, of course, since 
that was what he clearly wanted. 
Since he could breathe air we 
GALAXY 



could not, we expected that our 
air would be poinsonous to him 
and that we would have to take 
him out again almost at once. 

But he didn’t seem to notice 
the difference. 

At close cjuarters, he wasn’t a 
man after all. He was merely a 
fair copy. And we guessed at 
once that the highest life form of 
Procarpa was capable of fantas- 
tic mimicry. Pie and his kind, 
unknown to us, had been watch- 
ing us through the dome, and at 
least one had fashioned himself 
on us. 

He could not talk. Apparently 
he had no heart, and he did not 
breathe. What appeared to be 
clothes were part of the creature 
himself. 

Simple tests showed he had 
intelligence comparable to our 
own. He made no objection to 
examination. 

He was a non-vertebrate pro- 
toplasmic mystery ... his body 
turned out to consist of white 
flesh rather like that of some 
fish, but with the property of be- 
ing soft or hard at will. We 
could not, of course, dissect or 
vivisect him without declaring 
war on his race — we presumed, 
rightly, that he was not unique. 

To say that we were interested 
is an understatement. We had 
found the most adaptable form of 
life yet known, perhaps the most 
adaptable in the galaxy. 

We were still more interested 
when we noticed, after he had 
been with us for a few hours, that 
he was now an exact copy of a 
human being — except that his 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



clothes were stiU part of him. 
The change had been gradual. 
But now he had hair, instead of a 
dark area of flesh the color of 
hair. His eyes, his hands, his 
mouth, his nails, his nostrils were 
now like ours — and he was 
breathing. 

We offered him food, and he 
ate it. 

Then, as an experiment, one of 
the lab technicians stripped and 
showed him what a human body 
really looked like. At once he 
began to change. In an hour he 
was a perfect, naked, human male. 
What had looked like clothes 
were incorporated in him . 

Well, what else could have 
been done, then? We were not, 
thought the Director, positively 
not wrong to do exactly as we 
did. We’re supposed to be a re- 
search station, aren’t we, a colo- 
ny set up to find out about a 
chosen world? 

The Procarpan was given 
clothes and shown how to put 
them on. He picked up things with 
uncanny rapidity . perhaps 
this was the first hint of warn- 
ing. 

We had been talking to him, 
of course, and by this time he 
was talking back. He had no diffi- 
culty in imitating human speech. 
Indeed, he did this so well that 
he answered every remark in an 
exact copy of the speaker’s voice. 

It was when a girl from the 
kitchen came to take away the 

173 



dishes that he made his first di- 
rect request He had no difficul- 
ty in making himself clear. He 
had noticed that there were two 
types of human. He wanted the 
waitress to take off her clothes 
so that he could examine her. 

It was funny, the Director 
thought, in view of the situation 
in the colony during the last 
month, what difficulty this caus- 
ed at the time. The waitress was 
scandalized. The scientists, in- 
terested to see if the Procarpan 
would now turn himself into a 
woman given the necessary in- 
formation, were all for the ex- 
periment. But the girl refused 
point-blank and stormed out. 

The only women present at the 
time were a doctor and a physi- 
cist, neither youthful and both 
understandably modest. A call 
went out for volunteers, and sev- 
eral soon appeared. But they all 
proposed to go no further than 
to wear a bikini. The scientists 
explained patiently that this, in 
the circumstances, was no use. 
The volunteers said bikini or 
nothing, but they didn’t mean 
this literally. In fact, they with- 
drew. 

Eventually it was a young 
nurse, Terry Walter, who agreed. 
And it was the greatest mistake 
of her short life. 

The Director wrote: 

We were rather disappointed 



at the result, or rather lack of re- 
sult. The Procarpan merely look- 
ed at the girl from all angles, 
touched her lightly once or twice, 
and appeared to have lost inter- 
est. And he stayed as he was. 

The sequel came two hours 
later — and it was almost as 
startling as the Procarpan’s first 
appearance. 

A naked Terry Walter was 
seen outside the dome. She was 
admitted and given clothes. The 
real Terry Walter was summoned 
— and the two were more similar 
than identical twins. They spoke 
in the same voice . but there 
the resemblance broke down, since 
the real Terry knew everything 
she had always known, and the 
fake Terry knew only what the 
male Procarpan in the laboratory 
knew. 

This was astonishing enough. 
The first Procarpan had not been 
outside the dome. Yet two hours 
after he saw Terry Walter, an 
exact copy appeared from out- 
side. 

Of course we saw the signifi- 
cance of this. The Procarpans 
were not only adaptable, they 
were telepaths. More than that, 
the fake Terry knew, had ap- 
parently heard and seen, all that 
the male Procarpan knew. And 
a simple test soon showed that 
whatever the fake Terry was told, 
he instantly knew. 

The Director paused for a 
moment and then wrote reluc- 
tantly : 



174 



GALAXY 



To give him full credit. Dr. 
Arthur Stevens immediately ad- 
vised caution. He came to me 
and pointed out that we were 
not merely entertaining two possi- 
bly dangerous aliens of unknown 
(hough obviously vast potential, 
but also their entire race. Every 
Procarpan — and there might be 
a dozen of them or millions — 
apparently had access to all that 
one of them experienced. Per- 
haps they were not really a race 
of individuals at all, but a single 
entity with individual members. 
And we were keeping practically 
nothing secret from them. 

I told Stevens that we must 
find out all we possibly could 
about the Procarpans. We must 
continue teaching them our lan- 
guage so that they could tell us 
aliout themselves. 

Tills they never did . 

The Director looked for a long 
time at those last four words. 

V 

C C "NT ext, please,” Stevens call- 

^^ed. 

And so it went on. An ex- 
haustive test, and even then not 
necessarily a conclusive one, 
could take an hour. Average, say 
forty minutes. The team could 
scarcely work more than four- 
teen hours a day. That meant 
twenty-one tested a day. And 
there were three hundred nine 
colonists. 

PLANET OF FAKERS 



There had been a lot more. 
Originally there had been 371 
colonists. Sixty-two had been 
possessed by Fakers, who had 
been detected and destroyed. Or 
rather, 62 had been destroyed, 
59 of whom had been Fakers . 

Jonina had come up with some 
thing this time. She gave the 
electrician who entered an or- 
dinary wooden pencil, new, hexa- 
gonal, unsharpened. 

The electrician, Saunders, said ; 
“Where d’you get hold of that? 
Haven’t seen one for years. Cer- 
tainly never thought we’d 
brought any with us.” 

“I found a box of twelve,” Jo- 
nina said, “and that’s the only 
one out of it. We can be quite 
certain there isn’t another in the 
dome.” 

Saunders was puzzled. “What 
about it? What do you want me 
to do with it?” 

“Write your name.” 

“Huh?” Involuntarily he look- 
ed around. 

“What are you looking for?” 

“Well, I guess there isn’t such 
a thing as a sharpener in the 
colony. I’ll need a knife, a razor 
or something.” 

“Okay,” Stevens said. “You 
can go.” 

Among the three of them who 
remained when he had left — 
the guards were instructed to act 
as much as possible like robots, 
doing and saying nothing but 

175 



what they were told — the fa- 
miliar excitement began to grow. 
Were they really on to some- 
thing? 

“Think it’s definitive?” Jo- 
nina asked. 

“We’ll have a better idea when 
Anna gets back.” As Stevens 
spoke, Anna came in. 

“I couldn’t find a picture or 
an explanation in the library,” 
she said. “The encyclopedias 
don’t mention pencils at all. The 
dictionary merely says ‘old-fash- 
ioned form of stylus.” 

“So maybe it will work,” Ste- 
vens said thoughtfully. He pick- 
ed up the pencil. “A thing like 
this could beat the Fakers. We 
could have everybody in here 
in an hour or two . Jonina, 
run after Saunders and warn him 
under no circumstances to say 
a word about this test to any- 
body.” Jonina left hurriedly. 

“We could improve the test,” 
Stevens went on. 

“Not mention what the pen- 
cil is for?” Evans suggested. 
“Not even give a clue by ask- 
ing people to write their name?” 

“No, I guess we have to do 
that — a lot of our own people 
will need that slight clue to re- 
mind them what a pencil is. But 
with that, they’ll know. There 
can’t be anybody here who didn’t 
use pencils as a kid. No, I was 
thinking of two other things. 
Anyone got a knife?” 

176 




vans gave him a scalpel. 

“You’re not going to sharpen 
it, surely? That would give the 
whole thing away ...” 

He broke off as he saw what 
Stevens was doing. In gold on 
the red pen were the words : 
BLUE STAR PENCIL CO. 
MADE IN JAPAN. HB. Stevens 
carefully cut out “pencil”. 

“No use letting them know 
what to look for,” he said. “An- 
na, have you any red nail var- 
nish?” 

Anna rolled her eyes. “Men,” 
she said succinctly. “I wonder 
why we bother . We’re sup- 
posed to be getting married, and 
he’s never noticed I don’t use 

GALAXY 



nail lacquer. Jonina uses it. Fin- 
gers and toes. And it’s about that 
shade.” 

Evans was puzzled. “You’d 
hardly need to cover up that 
shaved bit, would you?” he said. 
“To a Faker, that would only 
add to the mystery.” 

“That’s not what I had in 
mind.” 

Anna had looked in Jonina’s 
handbag. “Here you are.” 
Stevens held the pencil with 
one end up. “You can see the 
lead. A smart person who had 
never seen or heard of a pencil 
might see the core and guess 
what it was for, and then it 
wouldn’t be hard to work out 
that the wood had to be cut 




immmm 




PLANET OF FAKERS

away to make a point. Let’s 
make it a little more difficult, 
shall we?” 

Carefully he lacquered the two 
ends of the pencil. When the lac- 
quer dried there was no sign of 
the graphite. 

“I really think we’ve got some- 
thing,” Evans said quietly. “How 
about a two-minute snap test, 
everybody in line, guards on the 
job, no talking?” 

“Go ahead,” Stevens said. 
“Get on the intercom.” 

“Are we telling the Director?” 
“No. The fewer people who 
know what’s going on the better.” 
He frowned. “Jonina’s taking her 
time ...” 

J onina caught up with Saun- 
ders in the long corridor that 
linked the living quarters with 
the lab block. Since there were 
guards at each end, there was 
little or no danger here. 

The white worms that could 
turn humans into Fakers were 
about eight inches long and 
slightly less than two inches 
thick. They were not, fortunately, 
tremendously mobile. Thus al- 
though when they did manage 
to strike they could penetrate the 
victim’s skin in practically no 
time and take over completely 
within two or three seconds, any- 
one who saw them in time could 
escape. It was useless to stamp 
on them or grasp them — the 
178 



worm always won such encoun- 
ters. If you didn’t have a gun 
you ran. 

Fortunately, too, in their 
worm form the Fakers were not 
particularly adaptable. They 
could change color but not their 
shape to any great extent. It was 
assumed that the worm form was 
the irreducible Faker physical 
minimum, designed for posses- 
sion, not adaptation. 

The worms could penetrate 
most fabric as if it were not 
there, but metal completely de- 
feated them and wood in good 
condition was nearly as effective 
a barrier, especially if it was 
painted. 

So the labs and kitchens and 
living quarters, constantly pa- 
trolled by men and women with 
stun guns, were reasonably safe. 
Worms that did get in were al- 
most certain to be seen and 
destroyed. And although they 
took chances and never in any 
circumstance left any person 
they had possessed, if indeed this 
was possible for them, the des- 
truction of individual worms 
evidently did matter to them. 
The chances they took to possess 
humans were seldom suicidal. 

The snags from the humans’ 
angle were that all Fakers in 
human form carried in their 
bodies, undetectable, two or 
three worms capable of further 
conquests, and that in the dome 

GALAXY 



it was impossible always to re- 
main indoors. What had been 
brought and set up was, after 
all, only a skeleton settlement, 
incapable without building ma- 
terials of some kind of modifica- 
tion, adaptation or expansion. 
Besides, three-quarters of the 
colonists were fully occupied one 
way or another in the fight to 
counter and contain the Fakers, 
and the rest were engaged in 
essential services. It might be 
possible, by total concentration, 
to halt possession by Fakers. But 
it wasn’t possible to do that and 
everything else. 

Oaunders turned inquiringly as 
^ Jonina came up behind him. 

“That test,” Jonina said 
breathlessly. “You mustn’t 
breathe a word about it to any- 
body. If anybody asks, you know 
nothing.” 

“Sure,” said the electrician. 
Then his attention was caught. 
It wasn’t surprising. Well-en- 
dowed at any time, Jonina, 
breathing deeply, made a re- 
markable spectacle. 

“What’s it worth not to tell.?” 
Saunders murmured. 

“Don’t be crazy.” 

He put his arms round her 
and tried to kiss her. For a mo- 
ment Jonina, who was not ex- 
actly inhibited, did not resist. 
Saunders was young and not un- 
attractive, and what was a kiss 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



between people who were not 
even friends? 

Then suddenly she had a mo- 
ment of purest terror. 

Often this must be how it hap- 
pened. 

Nudity gave some sort of ex- 
cuse for playfulness. You didn’t 
have to be young. You didn’t 
have to be of different sexes. 
Any time two people met in a 
non -public spot, a certain bois- 
terous horseplay would seem 
anything but suspicious. 

And then . two bodies press- 
ed together, breast against breast, 
abdomen against abdomen . 
Even the second or two of re- 
sistance would be cloaked. A 
girl, a man held by strong arms 
would try to make a perfectly 
natural breakaway — while 
something passed from one body 
through another. 

She reacted, violently. She 
used her knee, both hands, her 
head, an elbow. She made quite 
a mess of the playful technician. 
And in doing so she satisfied her- 
self completely that it hadn’t 
really been necessary. 

Her terror dissolved. “You’ll 
keep quiet,” she said. 

It would be some time before 
he could speak. “Well, I’m sor- 
ry,” she said mildly, “but with 
this sort of thing going on, any- 
one who steps out of line de- 
serves anything he gets.” 

She waited until he could walk, 

179 



then left him. When he did get 
his breath back, he didn’t speak. 
He would never be a friend of 
hers. 

She started back to the clinic. 

Oo that they could never tell 
us about themselves. 

This they never did . 

It was possible, the Director 
thought, that there was nothing 
to tell. The Fakers were 100% 
parasites, their life goal being to 
imitate. Perhaps they had no re- 
membered history. Perhaps, with 
each new race they learned to 
imitate, the past was cancelled. 

Well, he might as well bring 
the summary up to date. 

The two imitation humans 
lived among us for weeks learn- 
ing. Their powers of assimilation 
were remarkable. In no time 
they had vocabularies better than 
average, became quite indistin- 
guishable from real humans, were 
even considered as humans. 

We liked them. They soon 
knew everyone in the colony by 
name, talked with them, learned 
their history. They were the best 
listeners we had ever known. 

The fake Terry Walter was 
particularly popular — though, 
as we learned afterwards, her 
extensive relations with the men 
in the colony were in the sexual 
sense innocent . 

Our discovery of the next step 
in the Faker campaign was acci- 

180 



dental. We might never have dis- 
covered what was happening at 
all, or only when it was far 
too late. 

A friend of the real Terry 
came directly to me. She was 
puzzled. She and Terry had 
known each other for a long time. 
They had a strictly private word 
game of their own, one they had 
never shared with anyone. 

Now suddenly Terry didn’t 
any more. 

We thought at first that the 
real and fake Terry were hav- 
ing some fun with us, as twins 
do. We brought them together. 

We found that one of them, no 
matter how good a copy, could 
still be identified as a Procar- 
pan. Blood and other samples re- 
moved from her responded exact- 
ly like human samples at first. 
But in a matter of minutes or 
hours they changed, attempting 
to turn into something else . 

We realized the gravity of the 
situation. Both Procarpans were 
locked up. The creature who had 
been the real Terry was ex- 
haustively questioned. It was be- 
yond doubt that her body had 
been taken over somehow by the 
Procarpans. 

And how many more? 

That was when the testing 
started. 

Well, how could anyone have 
guessed, the Director thought, 
that the Procarpans had two 
totally different techniques of 

GALAXY 



imitation? Making themselves 
look like humans, even actually 
existing humans, had been rela- 
tively harmless. Anyway, there 
had been only two of them. The 
question of admitting to the 
dome five hundred Procarpans 
looking like humans had never 
arisen. 

But finding that a human had 
become a Procarpan was a dif- 
ferent matter. 

We tried to restore Terry. We 
asked the Procarpan inside her 
to bring her back, to leave her. 
He, she or it merely went on 
with the stubborn, hopeless pre- 
tense of being Terry. 

We tried drugs. We even tried 
torture. Nothing happened ex- 
cept that when the Faker realiz- 
ed that we were never going to 
stop, that Terry W'alter, possess- 
ed, would never be free among 
us again, she decided to die. 

She died. We could not stop 
her. Significantly, however, we 
noticed the typical green tinge 
after death which apparently is 
an infallible sign. 

The two imitation humans died 
too. 

But now we were alerted: how 
many other Fakers were already 
among us? 

We started testing. Then it 
was easy. Friends asked questions 
which only the real person 
could answer. There were, we 
found, already four Fakers among 
us. 

PLANET OF FAKERS 



We tried to restore the vic- 
tims, but apparently Fakers never 
let go — if they are capable of 
letting go. We don’t know. 

It must be admitted that 
though we saw the horror of 
situation, it was some time before 
we saw the complete danger. 
The trouble was every Falser 
knew everything which had ever 
been said or done in the presence 
of any Faker, or the two imita- 
tion humans. 

They were the people they 
seemed to be, and therefore no 
medical test worked. Somewhere 
in their body, as we now know, 
there was a white worm • — but 
we have never found any way of 
establishing this short of execu- 
tion . 

But because at first it was so 
easy to spot Fakers, most of us 
assumed it would always be so. 

We were wrong. It was not 
long before a male Faker could 
graphically describe a baseball 
game, demonstrate golf shots, tell 
off-color stories, and describe ac- 
tual locations on Earth. Soon a 
girl Faker could react to clothes, 
perfume, obscenity, compliments 
exactly like a real girl. 

For a time actual sexual inter- 
course was definitive — but only 
for a time. Pain worked briefly. 
So did tests based on creative 
sense of humor, for the Fakers 
could only imitate humor, not 
initiate it. Unfortunately, many 
humans are similar. 

We soon found out about the 
worms. It was after that that I 

181 



ordered total nudity all the time, 
after a plump woman Faker in 
blouse and slacks was found to 
be carrying seventeen worms oii 
her body, to say nothing of any 
others that might have been in 
it. 

Soon we reached a stage when 
we could test a suspect for an 
hour and not be sure. Everything 
which had worked before was 
known and rendered useless. 

Skills were still beyond the 
Fakers. No Faker can play the 
piano — but they can sing and 
whistle, and they know all the 
tunes the average person knows, 
all the words. 

Now we’re in the position 
where we’re not so much trying 
to beat the Fakers as beat our- 
selves — think of important, vi- 
tal, significant, definitive things 
which, so far, we’ve missed . 

The Director took a fresh 
sheet and wrote firmly: 

My only mistake, the only one 
which can be held against me, was 
not ordering withdrawal from this 
world the last time I could be 
certain that every Faker among 
us had been detected. 

Unless we find a storybook so- 
lution that totally nullifies the 
Fakers, Procarpa must certainly 
be abandoned. But obviously we 
cannot take this scourge with us. 

It could be the end of the hu- 
man race; perhaps before this 
the Fakers have totally eradi- 
cated other races, here or else- 

182 



where. Besides, from our own 
point of view, we should not 
wish to be imprisoned in a ship 
with such an enemy . 

He had thought that through 
and made up his mind. It was 
possible that the problem could 
very easily be beaten on a ship. 
The Fakers might depend on a 
supply of worms and be inca- 
pable of quick procreation off 
Procarpa. Perhaps on a ship the 
problem would sink to negligible 
proportions. 

But perhaps it wouldn’t. 

The Fakers apparently could 
learn nothing they hadn’t been 
taught. And the settlers had been 
careful not to teach them about 
space travel. 

It wasn’t really a heroic, no- 
ble, selfless decision. If they 
couldn’t get off Procarpa with- 
out Fakers among them, it ob- 
viously wasn’t worth getting off 
Procarpa at all. 

VI 

tCXI^hat kept you? What 
’ ’happened?” said Stevens 
as Jonina returned. 

Her moment of terror, and the 
whole brief episode, was now 
quite unimportant. “Nothing,” 
she said. 

Evans had just finished ar- 
ranging an immediate snap test 
of the entire personnel, except 

GALAXY 



the Director, when the intercom 
buzzed. He came back to the 
group at the other end of the 
clinic, his face grave. 

“That Black Beauty query,” 
he said. “Nobody told anyone 
anything.” 

Stevens frowned. “That means 
that whoever told has been tak- 
en over already,” he said. “Well 
. let’s get started. 

The organization for such a 
snap test had been worked out 
long ago. Everybody in the colo- 
ny would be in the open, spac- 
ed out, watched by guards. There 
would be no talking. People test- 
ed and passed would go back to 
their places. 

If the test worked and went on 
working — and those were big 
ifs — they would spot every Fak- 
er at present in the colony. 

The first ten men and women 
knew at once what the red ob- 
ject was and knew it had to be 
sharpened. The eleventh was 
puzzled, and just as the six peo- 
ple in the room were becoming 
nearly certain she was a Faker, 
she suddenly realized: “Oh, it’s 
a pencil.” 

The thirteenth turned the pen- 
cil over and over, tried to write 
with it, pressed the shaved spot 
in the hope that a stylus would 
pop out, felt for catches, tried to 
unscrew it. He acted exactly like 
any human being presented with 
a writing tool unfamiliar to him. 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



But Stevens had to back his 
judgment . 

There was the usual tense per- 
iod of waiting. The man on the 
floor might have died simply for 
the crime of not recognizing a 
pencil, never having used one as 
a child. 

He hadn’t. He was a Faker. 

In their relief and excitement, 
the four testers hugged eadi 
other. Jonina (who had already 
forgotten all about Saunders) 
even hugged the two guards, who 
were usually completely ignored. 

' I 'hey had a test which worked. 

•*' No Faker knew what to do 
with the pencil, and this time, 
owing to the precautions taken, 
there was no way for the Fakers 
to find out. 

If any of the men and wom- 
en armed and appointed as 
guards was a Faker, there could 
be a bloody gun battle — but 
this was unlikely, since the Fak- 
ers played their parts so perfect- 
ly that a Faker who was a guard 
would act like a guard up to the 
moment of discovery. 

The testing went on. 

The next Faker knew, of 
course, that it was no use press- 
ing the shaved spot. He tried 
licking the pencil. 

They didn’t wait this time to 
make sure he was a Faker. They 
bundled the corpse into one of 
the cubicles and went on test- 

183 



ing. But he was a Faker all right. 

The next Faker demanded ink. 
Evidently the Fakers had decid- 
ed by this time that the red stick 
was simply a very primitive pen, 
and they knew about ink. 

He was shot too and pushed 
into a cubicle. 

There were some near things 
with people who were not Fak- 
ers. One girl of seventeen, the 
youngest person in tire colony 
— brought along because her 
mother, father and brother were 
there — seemed to have no idea 
what the red stick could be. Stev- 
ens would have given the signal 
to have her shot but for the 
fact that he knew her brother 
and parents were in the colony. 
If she had become a Faker, could 
they possibly have failed to spot 
it? 

So they gave her every chance. 
Could it be that lead pencils 
were now so old-fashioned that 
the youngest people had never 
used, seen, or heard of them? Yet 
Jonina, who had thought of the 
test, was only eighteen. 

Finally it clicked. The girl had 
seen sharpened pencils but did 
not know them in their un- 
sharpened form. She did not 
know they could come that way. 

Altogether, they spotted and 
killed seven Fakers. 

The very last was a Faker; he 
had chosen to remain in this 
position so that he would have 
184 



the very maximum chance of 
finding out something in time to 
save himself. 

But all he had managed to 
figure out was that since the red 
stick did not write by itself, since 
it did not unscrew and evidently 
was not used with ink or paint, 
it must be an instrument which 
worked in conjunction with a 
special surface, like chalk on a 
blackboard or an etching needle 
on metal. He therefore asked for 
“the right paper” . 

When they had confirmed that 
he had been a Faker, the tec 
team members were jubilant. 
They had not expected such suc- 
cess. For some time now all the 
most brilliant ideas had been 
countered. 

“I must see the Director,” 
Stevens said. 

“To give him the test too?” 
Evans said meaningly. 

“That as well. But mainly be- 
cause now, if we take real emer- 
gency measures, we can beat the 
Fakers. Never let anybody out 
of the sight of at least three other 
people, even for an instant. Keep 
everybody squatting in the open 
if necessary. After all, we’re un- 
der a dome.” 

T Te put a call through. “It’s a 
breakthrough,” he told the 
Director jubilantly. “We figured 
out a test ... of course it won’t 
work again, after today, but we 

GALAXY 



know as of now there are no Fak- 
ers left in the colony. How about 
that. Director?” 

There was a moment’s pause. 
Then the Director’s voice ex- 
ploded on them: “Fool! Get over 
here right away.” And the line 
went dead. 

They looked at each other. 
“The Director?” said Evans. 
“Could he be — ?” 

“No,” said Stevens positively. 
“And if he were, he wouldn’t 
step out of line by blaming us 
for catching Fakers.” 

“All the same,” said Evans, 
“we’ll all go with you, Steve.” 
They went to the Director’s 
room. He had calmed down a 
little. He was disappointed now 
rather than angry. 

First, however, Stevens gave 
him the pencil. 

“Oh, that?” he said. “Did that 
work? The Fakers didn’t know 
it had to be sharpened? Steve, 
we’ve missed a great chance. You 
should have told me you had 
something . Are you sure this 
won’t work again?” 

Stevens shrugged. “Pretty cer- 
tain. The Fakers will take over 
somebody or other within hours. 
Now that the test is over and 
everybody’s dispersed, the pen- 
cil probe will be freely discussed 
— a Faker could find out what 
he wanted to know without even 
asking directly.” 

“We’ve missed a great chance,” 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



the Director repeated gloomily. 
“This could have got us off the 
planet.” 

The team exchanged glances. 
“You’re prepared to abandon the 
colony, then?” said Stevens. 

“What choice is there? No one 
else would come here. We’ve 
found no natural resources any- 
way, and the atmosphere is poi- 
sonous. Colony Control wouldn’t 
finance more than a base here, 
even without Fakers. As it is — 
I decided some time ago we must 
abandon the colony the moment 
we can be sure we’re absolutely 
clean — ” 

“Then you might have told 
us,” Evans said. 

“It’s up to you to tell me when 
you have — ” 

“Director, it’s foolish to ex- 
pect anyone to work in the dark,” 
said Stevens bluntly. “Anyway, 
we know we’re clean now. Why 
not — ” 

“No, it’s useless,” said the 
Director wearily. “We need at 
least two tenders to take every- 
body off. Even then people will 
be packed like sardines in con- 
ditions that can’t be maintained 
for more than an hour or two. 
By the time we’ve rebuilt a sec- 
ond tender, there will be Fakers 
among us again.” 

“If we line up everybody and 
never let people even go to the 
bathroom except in sixes . ” 
Stevens said. 



185 



Director shook his head 
impatiently. “A second ten- 
der can’t be reassembled that 
way.” 

“Then why not do it in two 
trips? We know the ship is clean 
since the Fakers have no ma- 
chines and wouldn’t work ours 
anjrway. Take a tested batch up 
and then test the second batch.” 

“I’m not going to withdraw un- 
til we can all withdraw,” said the 
Director flatly. 

Again the team exchanged 
glances. No one had more cause 
than they to know that the Dir- 
ector’s handling of the whole sit- 
uation had not been perfect. But 
he was the Director. Things had 
to be done his way. He was like 
the captain of a ship — in final 
command. 

“Well, I guess it’s no use argu- 
ing,” said Stevens. “I take it 
you’re going to have a second 
tender restored and then, when 
everything’s ready, you want an- 
other definite test?” 

“Another short test,” the Di- 
rector corrected. “If it takes half 
an hour per person, that’s too 
long. That means seventy-five 
hours to load each tender, and 
we can’t shut up one fifty people 
in a tender for more than a few 
hours . What I want is this. 
We rebuild a tender, get every- 
thing complete and then aU line 
up. Before anybody has to eat 
or drink or sleep, before the 
186 



Fakers have a chance to do any- 
thing entirely new, you get 
everybody positively cleared and 
into the two tenders. That means 
a quick test like the one you’ve 
just used. Hell, you’ve proved 
it’s possible. Why can’t you do 
it again?” 

VII 

\ s far as the team, back in the 
clinic, was concerned, this 
question was easy to ask but very 
difficult to answer. 

They discussed the matter 
without the guards, though the 
guards were safe. A password 
system was employed. This work- 
ed perfectly on a small scale, in 
research teams and with a few 
trusted guards, but human na- 
ture prevented it from working 
in the colony at large. Such a 
system had been tried several 
times, and it had always broken 
down. 

In any large group there were 
always some who had to tell . 

Evans said: “Sure, when a 
simple little thing like the pen- 
cil test works, it suddenly looks 
for about five minutes as if tliis 
problem wouldn’t give an aver- 
age-grade moron much trouble. 
But the fact is we can test and 
test for days and let every Faker 
in the colony through the net.” 

“I think,” Jonina remarked, 
“that the first thing to figure 

GALAXY 



out is some nasty accident that 
might happen to the Director.” 
Stevens nodded. “I know what 
you mean.” 

“Do you?” 

There was a strange quality 
in her voice that made them all 
look at her. She was tense as a 
high diver before a leap. 

“We’re the testers,” she said 
meaningly. “Suppose we find the 
Director is a Faker?” 

“But he isn’t,” said Stevens. 
“He’s wrong, but he’s no Faker.” 
“Does that make a differ- 
ence?” Jonina said. 

Then they saw exactly what 
she meant. They saw, too, why 
she made the suggestion while 
the guards were not present. 

They had to kill Fakers. If 
they made mistakes, it was too 
bad. No one could hold them 
responsible, any more than a 
surgeon could be held responsi- 
ble when the patient died. 

“No,” said Anna abruptly. 
“That wouldn’t help. At the 
present moment, I guess the 
Director’s right.” 

“Huh?” Evans exclaimed. 
“Yes, right. If the final stage 
is anything but a quick all-or- 
nothing test, the Fakers have 
time to see what’s happening 
and try something new.” 

“Such as?” 

She shrugged. “With their 
abilities, do you think they 
couldn’t figure out something — 

PLANET OF FAKERS 



if they saw defeat staring them 
in the face?” 

They didn’t. 

fn five days the tender was 
JLready. Every inch of it was 
tested during assembly, in case 
the Fakers could be metal and 
plastic as they could be human 
beings. (But if so, surely the bat- 
tle was over and the Fakers had 
won?) When ready, it was sealed, 
like the other tender. There were 
no worms in either of them. 

Routine tests had" identified no 
new Fakers, and there might be 
none. But the work of reassem- 
bling the tender, and the conse- 
quent disorganization and strain 
on the remaining accommoda- 
tions, meant opportunities which 
must, Stevens decided grimly, 
have resulted in the creation of 
at least six new Fakers. 

The Director — and Anna — 
were right. It was impossible, on 
a long-term basis, to keep a colo- 
ny under a dome running and 
have all the top brains engaged 
in a fight against the Fakers and 
at the same time ensure that no- 
body was ever alone or in twos 
or threes, anyway, in a standard 
settlement with only earth as 
raw material. 

Talks went on every day on the 
final test. The Director some- 
times attended, and the scientists 
working on the problem from 
other angles, were consulted. 



187 



Generally it was agreed that 
something like the pencil test 
must be the answer. It had to 
be something that every human 
knew about, and no Faker. 
Therefore it had to be some- 
thing which had no day-to-day 
part in the life of the colony 
and which would not have been 
discussed. 

Following the success of the 
pencil test, filling and using a 
fountain pen was considered. 
Apart from the fact, however, 
that no pen could be found in 
the colony, the test was finally 
decided to be inadequate. Al- 
though one or two Fakers might 
not show sufficient familiarity 
with a pen, the third or fourth 
would have figured it all out. 

There had never been a baby’s 
bottle in the colony. But again, 
every test based on such an ob- 
ject seemed too easy. 

"V To Faker, given combustibles, 
-*■ ^ would know how to light a 
fire — at least, so it was assum- 
ed. Would every human? Could 
the team see the difference, in 
a practical test, between a hu- 
man with only theoretical knowl- 
edge of lighting fires and a Fak- 
er with only theoretical knowl- 
edge of lighting fires? 

Mechanical tests, earlier, had 
been very effective. The snag 
was that the Fakers, although 
they had never shown more than 
188 



average mechanical aptitude, 
had become better at some of 
these tests than the least apt 
humans. 

Earlier, too, tests based on the 
fact that the Fakers had no orig- 
inal sense of humor had worked. 
But many humans had no in- 
dividual sense of humor either. 
They had learned to laugh at 
certain words, certain situations, 
certain behaviors. They laughed 
because others laughed. Given 
a test designed to grade their ap- 
preciation of the comic, they 
came out lower than the Fakers 
— who were better at imitation 
than any human. 

Thousands of things were con- 
sidered. Every possible test, even 
those constructed on impeccable 
principles, had a hole. 

Every human had to pass. 
Every Faker had to fail. 

A series of tests was postulat- 
ed: tests of mechanical aptitude, 
sense of humor, selfconsciousness 
and other human characteristics 
and capacities. Yet suppose 
some rated like a Faker on all 
tests — did that prove he was 
a Faker? 

Unfortunately, no. 

The first idea came from An- 
na — and it was not a test. 

She pointed out a mistake they 
had been making right from the 
beginning. An understandable but 
stupid mistake. 

Always, the moment they were 
GALAXY 



sure a suspect was a Faker, they 
executed him. Naturally, it was 
impossible to take chances once 
a Faker was discovered. 

But this meant that the Fakers 
always knew the key question. 

Suppose the pencil test had 
been included with others. Sup- 
pose no interest had been shown 
when a suspect failed to do any- 
thing with the pencil. Suppose 
he had been executed ten min- 
utes later. 

The Fakers would never have 
known their precise mistake. 

So it was agreed that when the 
key question was found. Fakers 
would not be executed instant- 
ly. The team would wait, acting 
as casually as possible, until 
something else happened which 
might be a mistake. Thus the 
value of the test might be pre- 
served. 

On the fifth day Anna said: 
“Suppose we put the clock for- 
ward two months?” 

It took the other three some 
time to work out what she 
meant. 

T?ven then, her idea, like Jo- 
nina’s, aroused no initial en- 
thusiasm. It did not seem to be 
definitive. It did not call for 
positive enough reaction. There 
must be a great deal about it 
in the library. The subject must 
surely have been discussed free- 
ly in the colony, in the hearing 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



of Fakers. Then, too. Fakers who 
failed the test early would pass 
on information which would en- 
able later Fakers to pass. 

Nevertheless, the four mem- 
bers of the team batted the idea 
around in their minds, did some 
checking in the library, and be- 
gan to see how the plan might 
work. 

The great virtue of the idea 
was the vast opportunity it gave 
Fakers to go wrong. Humans, 
with their background, their ex- 
perience, their seventeen (at 
least) years of life, could scarce- 
ly get completely on the wrong 
track. Although they might not 
know certain things, they could 
not possibly make any positive 
mistakes. 

It was not as simple as the 
pencil test. It would need equip- 
ment. It would need a specially 
prepared testing room, the con- 
tents of which must be kept se- 
cret. True, the second Faker 
would know all about them. But 
could he react correctly, even 
knowing? 

Gradually they came to be- 
lieve he could not. 

“But,” said Jonina glumly, 
“the Director will put his foot in 
it somehow.” 

“No, he won’t,” Stevens as- 
sured her. 

“You know him — ” 

“This is how we’ll work it. The 
Director, who won’t know a thing 

189 



about the test, will be tested first. 
He’ll be first in the first ship.” 
The other three brightened. 
“Then,” Stevens went on, “the 
pilots, engineers, technicians. If 
anything happens, the two ten- 
ders can be sealed and take off 

it 

“Leaving us behind,” Evans 
remarked quietly. 

“Quite. But that shouldn’t hap- 
pen. We’ll have Fred and Charlie 
with us. There shouldn’t be more 
than a dozen Fakers among us in 
all. The rota will be random so 
that they can’t be the last doz- 
en, or anything like that. You 
know what the Fakers are like. 
They’ll go on pretending, right 
to the end.” 

“We hope,” said Evans. “Steve, 
will it really work?” 

Stevens took a piece of paper 
from his pocket. “I took a leaf 
out of the Director’s book and 
worked this out on paper,” he 
said. “These are the reasons why 
I think Anna’s test will work.” 
They read : 

1. It is an essentially human 
thing. 

2. Many reactions, many hu- 
man reactions, are possible, but 
how could the Fakers guess any 
of them? (except those mention- 
ed in books). 

3. All humans have childhood 
memories of it. No Fakers have 
any knowledge of it at all, save 
from adults. 

190 



4. Fakers will know what Fak- 
ers have done in the test room, 
but not what any humans have 
done. 

VIII 

he day came. 

The two tenders stood 
ready, inside the dome. When 
they took off, the dome would 
be destroyed. 

This, they all believed, was 
important. Fakers found an in- 
telligent community and imitat- 
ed it. Possibly, once the humans 
had left they would go on pre- 
tending to be a human colony. 
And that might eventually be 
serious. 

But with the dome destroyed, 
with everything within it des- 
troyed — there would be an ex- 
plosion triggered by the atmos- 
pheric pressure change soon af- 
ter the dome went — the Pro- 
carpans would have neither 
cause nor opportunity to go on 
pretending to be humans. 

Between the tenders was a 
small steel hut with no v^indows 
and a single door. Inside the hut 
were Stevens, Evans, Jonina and 
two guards. Outside were Anna 
and two more guards. 

Around the hut and the ten- 
ders stood three hundred two 
people. There had never been 
a crowd quite like this. They 
were all quite naked, and they 

GALAXY 




didn’t make a sound. The guards 
among them had orders to shoot 
anyone who spoke. 

Anna was amused to see that 
the Director was quite nervous. 
He wanted to speak to her, but 
the rules were strict. He too 
would be shot if he tried to com- 
municate. 

Inside, Stevens said: “Well, 
this is it. If the Fakers have 
found out what we’re doing, if 
they manage to get through this 
test, we’ll just have to beat them 
on the ship.” 

“But the Director said . ” 
Jonina began. 

Stevens smiled. “The Director 
is first in line. Once the seal is 
broken and he’s in the tender, 
we’ll decide what’s to be done.” 

He nodded to the guard at the 
door, and the Director came in. 

One by one, the Director first, 
men and women emerged from 
the testing room and walked to 
the tenders. They went to ten- 
ders A and B alternately, so that 
overcrowding would not be too 
serious until the end. 

Fakers were spotted and, af- 
ter a misleading period of pre- 
tense, executed. 

No mistakes were made. No 
one who was not a Faker failed 
the test. And there was plenty 
of reason to believe that no one 
who was passed it. 

Like the pencil test, it was 
working. They could see that. 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



As in the pencil test, successive 
Fakers tried different things, and 
certain aspects of the testing had 
to be dropped once they knew 
the right answers. 

But the Fakers could not 
learn enough to get through. 

Gradually the crowd thinned. 
Anna was picking people for 
testing at random, so that the 
Fakers in the crowd could not 
determine the order of selection. 
If they could, they might give 
themselves a better chance of 
passing the test. They might, 
too, decide that the last half 
dozen or so should all be Fak- 
ers and take over guards and 
team. 

The crowd dwindled to a 
hundred, then fifty, then twenty. 

And suddenly Anna burst into 
the testing room. “Worms!” she 
screamed. “Hundreds of them!” 

They rushed out. 

All over the area within the 
dome, worms were oozing from 
the ground. The guards killed 
them as they came — but still 
they came. The remaining colo- 
nists leaped in a mad dance of 
survival. Two jumped the wrong 
way, were captured by worms, 
and were ruthlessly cut down. 

Stevens shouted and one tend- 
er door closed. Another shout 
and the four members of the 
team, the guards, and eleven 
colonists still not tested dashed 
to the other tender.

Within seconds they were off 
the surface of the planet. 

''T^he pilot protested. “Look, 
•*' I’m in charge of this ship, 
not you,” he said. 

“In a few minutes you will 
be,” said Stevens. “But you must 
realize that while eleven people 
are still untested, I have to be 
in charge. And I need the con- 
trol room. It’s the only space 
there is.” 

“You haven’t seen the way 
we’re crammed in this ship. Peo- 
ple are literally piled on top of 
each other in the lockers, even 
in the machine room. Believe me, 
the Black Hole of Calcutta must 
have been a luxury hotel com- 
pared with this.” 

“The ventilation here is ade- 
quate,” Stevens retorted. “No- 
body will die. Now you fly the 
ship. I’m finishing the testing 
in here.” 

The team and the guards 
knew what to do. 

The first of the last eleven en- 
tered. It was a girl, a very 
frightened girl. 

“We’ye lost the props,” Stev- 
ens said. “So we’ll have to do 
this in words. Suppose I wore a 
green suit and boots, wore a 
green hood, and had a long white 
beard. Suppose I had white fur 
round the edges of the suit. Who 
would I be?” 

192 



She stared at him blankly. Pa- 
tiently he described the garb 
again. 

“Green?” she said. 

“Green, or yellow.” 

“Not red?” 

“Okay, suppose it was red.” 
“You’d be Santa Claus.” 
“Could I have another name?” 
“Well ... St. Nicholas?” 
They began to relax, as they 
always did when they became 
sure they were testing a human, 
not in the presence of a Faker. 

The Fakers did not know 
about St. Nicholas. But earlier, 
satisfied from other evidence — 
they did not ask questions in 
the same order — that the sus- 
pect was a Faker, they had killed 
him the moment he mentioned 
St. Nicholas. Since then no Fak- 
er had mentioned the name. 

“Could I have still another 
name?” Stevens asked. 

The girl was puzzled for a 
moment. Then she tried tenta- 
tively: “Father Christmas?” 
They sent her to join the other 
humans packed like sardines. 

“I don’t get it,” the pilot said. 
“On that, can you be sure?” 

CCTt so happens,” Stevens said, 
-I- “that Father Christmas isn’t 
mentioned in any of the refer- 
ence books as the personification 
of Christmas. Santa Claus is, and 
so is St. Nicholas.” 



GALAXY 



“Seems a heck of a small thing 
to go on,” the pilot commented. 

“Maybe not so small . but 
we don’t have to rely on that. 
There’s lot’s more. Funny, the 
mistletoe bit never worked at 
all. They knew all about that. 
The point of this thing is, it’s 
the end of October and the colo- 
ny didn’t exist last Christmas. 
There hasn’t been a lot of talk 
about Christmas in the colony, 
and there’s no commercial cam- 
paign to keep reminding us how 
many shopping days there are 
till Christmas.” 

“But it must have been men- 
tioned,” said the pilot. 

“Sure it’s been mentioned — 
often. But there are no kids in 
the Colony. Christmas when it 
did come wasn’t going to be any- 
thing much. There would be only 
token presents, no cards, no tur- 
key, no snow. We’d have held a 
mild sort of celebration. Nobody 
was looking forward to Christ- 
mas particularly, because noth- 
ing much was going to happen. 
So why talk about it?” 

“Well ...” said the pilot. 
“Now do you mind if we get 
on?” 

The next suspect, also a girl, 
was asked: “What do you eat 
at Christmas?” 

She told them, quite confident- 
ly. She knew all about Christ- 
mas. She had seen about twenty 
of them — well, say seventeen, 
PLANET OF FAKERS 



since she wouldn’t remember 
much about the first two or 
three. 

And when she happened to 
mention pouring vodka over the 
pudding and setting it alight, 
Stevens passed her, although 
vodka was hardly traditional. 

They had had two pieces of 
luck in the test. They had ex- 
pected success with mistletoe 
(there was of course none in 
the colony), with various parts 
of the Christmas story, with 
snow, yule logs, reindeer, tur- 
keys, crackers, punch bowls and 
all the other things particularly 
associated with the old-fashion- 
ed, traditional Christmas. 

But of course chance oper- 
ated. And somehow the Fakers 
had altogether missed hearing 
about Father Christmas. They 
could not know the Christmas 
family ritual, for who would 
describe in detail what every- 
body knew? Even pictures of 
Santa Claus were only in black 
and white . 

Also, they had picked some- 
thing up wrong. They had heard 
vaguely about burning brandy 
at an old-fashioned Christmas 
feast. But they didn’t know it 
was poured over the pudding 
first. 

A young man entered. He 
talked about Santa Claus, but 
not about Father Christmas. He 
knew all about adult Christ- 

193 



mases, with paper hats and 
cocktails and mistletoe, but he 
was a little vague about the 
hanging-up-stockings ritual. He 
knew about burning brandy, 
but seemed to think it was 
poured into a small chalice and 
burned like, say, incense, as 
part of what was fundamentally 
a religious festival . 

The body was pushed out into 
space. 

He was the last Faker. There 
had been eleven in all . 

T?xhaustive tests on the ship 
convinced Stevens and the 
Director that there was not a 
Faker on board. They could be 
satisfied they were right, be- 
cause, in space again, all the 
humans could be expected to 
know what to do in a space- 
ship and no Faker could. 

The Director said: “Your test 
worked, Steve, and you can ac- 
cept my assurance that you and 
Anna will get full credit. But 
honestly, wasn’t the fact that it 
worked so well really luck? 
Couldn’t it have failed utter- 
ly?” 

“No,” said Stevens, “it couldn’t. 
There’s a whole body of ex- 
perience, and emotion, round a 



thing like Christmas. Sure, if 
one Faker had seen one genuine 
Christmas, the whole thing 
would have flopped. As it was, 
if some angles didn’t work, 
others were bound to work. And 
they went on working because 
we never let the Fakers know 
where they’d gone wrong.” 

He didn’t want to talk about 
it any more. It was over. Anna 
was waiting for him in the 
games room, and curiously, but 
understandably, she would be 
far more attractive in a halter 
and shorts than she had been 
without them . 

“It had to work,” he said, 
speaking the epitaph on the Fak- 
ers. “In an adult colony, two 
months before Christmas, how 
could anything the Fakers had 
heard enable them to guess what 
a child’s Christmas on Earth is 
like? How could they talk con- 
vincingly of a child’s feelings, 
even as a long-gone, distant 
thing? The bliss, the excitement 
of opening parcels on Christmas 
morning?” 

He grinned. “And how could 
they possibly guess the truth 
— that Santa Claus is really 
your old man?”

“We’re lookin| for people 
who want to write” 



By Gordon Carroll 

Director, Famous Writers School. Former 
editor, Reader's Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would likedo test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you can be 
trained to become a successful writer. 

Several years ago, we started the 
Famous Writers School. Our aim was to 
help qualified people acquire the skills 
they need to break into print. We poured 
everything we knew about writing into 
a new kind of professional training 
course, which you take at home and in 
your free time. After a solid grounding 
in fundamentals, you get advanced train- 
ing in the specialty of your choice— Fic- 
tion, Non-Fiction, Advertising or Busi- 
ness Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor spends up to two hours 
analyzing your work. He blue-pencils 
corrections right on it — much as an 
editor does with established writers. 
Then he returns it to you with a long 
personal letter of advice and specific 
recommendations. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to more than 100 



publications including Reader’s Digest, 
True, Redbook. 

Stephen Novak of Wayne, N. J., says, 
‘T just received a check from Ellery 
Queen's Mystery Magazine. That’s 1 1 
stories sold in sijc^onths.” Doris Steb- 
bins of S. Coventry, Conn., who has sold 
six stories to Woman’s Day for $2,050 
writes, “Taking your Course has made 
it all possible.” 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for the School’s Aptitude 
Test. If you test well, or offer other evi- 
dence of writing ability you may enroll. 
But there is no obligation to do so.
