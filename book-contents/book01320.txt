A RELATIVISTIC DILEMMA 



npvhe reason that a spaceship can- 

X not exceed the speed of lisrht, 
so they tell ns, Is that as it acceler- 
ates it gains mass. Take the closest 
we Stave to a real spcu:e-going space- 
ship now — say, the Gemini capsule, 
with a mass of something like ten 
thousand pounds. Accelerate it to 
nine-tenths the speed of lig'ht — oh, 
maybe 170,000 miles per second — 
and its moss has doubled. It now 
has a mass of twenty thousand 
pounds. Accelerate it some more. 
At 95% the s^d of light it may 
mass 40,000 pounds. At 96%, 80,- 
000 pounds. At 97% i)erhaps it 
reaches order-of-magnitude incre- 
ments . and when ultimately it 
achieves the full velocity of C (or 
more accurately, if it could achieve 
that velocity) its mass would be- 
come infinite. 

What happens when an infinite 
mass comes to exist in the universe 
is a sort of goblin s-will-get-you 
pleasantly chilling speculation that 
relativistic physicists and mathema- 
ticians amuse their friends with 
over edn stein of beer. One such re- 
cently suggested that the simplest 
way to describe the effect would 
simply be to say that tlie universe 
would collapse. 



Of course, in the real world it's 
not a problem — not now, anyway, 
or in the foreseeable future — be- 
cause we simply have no means of 
accelerating a mass to light speed. 
The more massive our Gemini cap- 
sule becomes the more difficult to 
accelerate; and you can't really 
push it up to the infinite-mass stage 
without infinite force in the thrust- 
ers to do the job. 

B ut look at it a different way. It 
doesn't much matter what mass 
you accelerate to that point. Start 
out with a 10,000-pound Gemini cap- 
sule — or a ten-billion-ton Skylark 
DuQuesne — or, for that matter, 
a feather. Infinite is infinite. 

What happens when you acceler- 
ate a rather small, but still measur- 
able, mass to light speed? Say a 
proton? Say we do it in a proton 
accelerator? 

Or more pertinently . bearing 
in mind that light itself has mass; 
it is deflected by gravitational 
fields, just like an orbiting rock — 
what happens when light travels at 
light speeds? 

If anyone happens to know the 
answer, will they please let us know 
it? Soon? — THE EDITOR

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



I 

I t did not stop moaning for a long 
time. ‘It was a battered mass of 
splintered bone and oozing blood 
and brains, matting strands of blond- 
ish, almost-human hair. But Bill 
Jackson continued to batter and to 
hack and to scream. Steadily, mon- 
otonously, until exhaustion overcame 
him. 



Slowly sanity returned. 

Tony Baker, former captain, 
USAF, Texas Corps had vomited. 
Now, spent and trembling, he wait- 
ed. Slowly the other man came from 
his knees to his feet, stilling his gory 
hands. His sleepwalker’s expression 
had changed to one of sane aware- 
ness. Then he too vomited. 

Without a word they brought gas- 
oline from the body of the smashed 



6 




plane, a blue-and-silver S-195 Scout- 
er. They poured it on the remains of 
the last android. Silently, his hands 
shaking, Bill Jackson struck a match, 
then threw its spurting flame into 
the mangled thing on the ground. 
They stepped back, raising their 
arms to shield their faces from the 
heat that flared and roared at them. 
They watched. 

Amid the flames something 
moved. 

Tony Baker gagged and turned 
away. Behind him a hand, rather 
like a human hand, rose slowly. A 
groan, rather like a human groan, 
sounded a last agony. “It wasn’t 
dead.” 

Tony turned back to watch as the 
tortured thing struggled in the 
flames. And at last the movements 
ceased. 

It was dead. 

T he two men stared in numbed 
horror. “I hate ’em,” Bill Jack- 
son said. “I’m glad it’s dead. But I 
wouldn’t have wished that on . 
on anything. We should’ve made 
sure . .” Then he remembered the 
awful way in which he had made 
sure, and he shuddered. 

He was the older of the two men. 
He wqs a big man, dark, with a per- 
petual beard-shadow on a massive 
face. His black hair was shot with 
a very few strands of gray. He was 
perhaps forty-one or-two. His hand 
rose now to Tony’s shoulder and 
they turned and walked across the 
little clearing to the stream trickling 
to the east of their camp. They 
squatted and washed themselves in 
the laughing, unconcerned water. 



“Bill,” Tony said in the moonlight.' 

“Yeah?” 

“It’s all over now, isn’t it?” 

“Yeah,” Bill Jackson said. He 
touched his whiskered chin, rubbing 
where blood clung. “Yeah, I guess it 
is, Sport.” 

“Bill . should we bury it?” 

Jackson looked at him. *^Bury it! 
Bury that? Tony, that thing — ” He 
broke off and their eyes spoke in the 
darkness. “Yeah. Yeah, I guess so 
Come on.” 

They walked from the bank of the 
stream back into the clearing. Back 
to the remains of their campfire — 
and of that other fire. 

Bill fixed a soldier’s trench shovel 
to his rifle. He dug a shallow hole 
and shoved in the charred remains. 
They stamped the earth, then hesi- 
tated, each thinking the same 
thought; then they left it, without 
praying, under the Christmasy shape 
of a tall pine. 

Automatically Bill went to the 
fire and threw three logs on, arrang- 
ing them to bum up. He turned. 

“Come on,” he said, and together 
they crossed the clearing to the 
stream. They jumped across, feet 
squishing, and scrambled up the 
little bank on the other side. The 
stream afforded a barrier of sorts 
on the east side of the camp, the 
scout-plane on the north, the cabin 
and palisade they planned would 
shelter the south end. Across the 
stream and the clearing, the camp’s 
west side was sheltered by a steeply 
sloping hill. They had almost de- 
nuded the hill of its good trees and 
had rolled the trunks down to form 
a barrier.

B ill Jackson sat down. Slowly 
Tony Baker sat beside him. 
“How many cigarettes left, 
Tony?” 

“Two.” 

Bill sighed. “Well, I can’t think of 
a better time to split one. We can’t 
save ’em forever.” 

Tony nodded and lit the ciga- 
rette. He inhaled deeply, slowly, lux- 
uriously, and passed it to the other 
man. 

“Tony . .” 

“Yeah?” 

“Let’s don’t talk about it. Let’s 
don’t think about it — let’s talk about 
something else.” Bill puffed and 
passed the cigarette back. 

“All right.” Tony looked at the 
moon riding high and fat and silvery 
above the trees. They sat in silence. 

Neither man was sure if he was 
sorry for what had been done; it 
had happened so suddenly. They had 
set the trap and it had been sprung. 
Flamed by the passions of the mo- 
ment and the danger and the hate 
instilled by years of war, they had 
been compelled toward the awful 
climax. Savagely — and half-hesitant- 
ly, even then — they had obeyed. And 
now it was done, their energies 
spent, and there was time for recol- 
lection, reflection . and, perhaps, 
remorse. 

“Well, dammit, talk about so«me- 
thing,” Bilj said. “I’m thinking about 
it — and I don’t want to!” 

“Uh — how’d it all start. Bill?” 
Tony asked. Tony was twenty-three, 
slighter: long, stringy muscles on a 
small frame; shorter by three inches. 
He had been an active participant 
in war since three days after his 



seventeenth birthday. He let the 
smoke trail out in a slow cloud, then 
handed the white cylinder back to 
the man who had pulled him out of 
his crashed aircraft. 

Bill answered quickly, seizing 
willingly upon a new subject. “We 
made ’em. Sport. We created ’em. 
At least the scientist-types did — in 
their labs. They want^ a sturdier 
breed for the mines and the factor- 
ies, so they mixed up chemicals and 
DNA and God knows what else and 
made the Androids.” He shook his 
head. “God! Made ’em!” He was 
seeing a vision of burning laborator- 
ies, burning scientists, dangling 
chemists, exploding chemicals. 
“They were tougher, stronger, lon- 
ger-lived. The scientists made ’em so 
they could reproduce themselves.” 
“That was the mistake, wasn’t 
it?” Tony said in a quiet, flat voice. 

“No. Just making ’em was the 
mistake. All those yowlin’ preachers 
were right. Pretty soon they were 
raising little As, thinking they were 
superior, smarter than men.” 
“Weren’t they?” 

Bill swung to stare at him. “You 
believe that?” 

T ony looked into eyes gone sud- 
denly ugly; looked and looked 
away, down at the moon’s wriggly 
reflection in the running water. “1 
don’t know. My father and brothers 
were fighting the As ever since I 
can remember. It was just natural. 
It was life. I was never even sure 
why. Everybody fought and fought 
and everybody died fighting or came 
back torn up; dead, really. I wasn’t 
— I’m not — old enough to remem-

IF 




ber, Bill. Are They? I mean, were 
they superior?” 

“Well, they were smart,” 
Bill said with proud reluctance. 
He handed Tony the cigarette’s last 
quarter-inch, pierced with a pin. He 
followed Tony’s eyes to the silver 
shimmer in the water. “But no, 
dammit, they weren’t menl They 
couldn’t’ve been as smart!” His hand 
dug the bayonet’s edge into the soft 
earth beside him. “But they were 
clever, crafty; they hid their real 
number, collected weapons, met sec- 
retly . plotted . .” 

“But we wouldn’t allow them 
equality,” Tony said. “When they 
made their pleas to the government.” 

“Pleas! DemandsF* Bill spat. “But 
we couldn’t. Lord, there wasn’t any 
choice; we made ’em. They weren’t 
people. It was them or us; they 
were trying to take over. We had to 
fight. Had to. There couldn’t be any 
mercy in that war. No mercy and 
no surrenler. We’d given the As the 
ability to think, to reason, and their 
reason told ’em they were slaves; 
that they’d always be slaves . 
unless they became man*s master. So 
we fought . and fought and 
fought. And here we are.” 

Tony Baker shuddered. “What a 
waste!” . 

“Yeah, waste. The waste was 
when we first made ’em,” Bill said, 
the words whipping out of him. 
“Speaking of waste — ” He took ^he 
remaining fraction of the cigarette. 
He inhaled with care, cursed as he 
burned his lip, extracted the pin. 
He killed the remains with a wetted 
thumb and returned the pin to the 
front of his shirt. 



Tony looked at him, then up at 
the moon; down at the water. “Uh — 
Bill. Is it true that there were . • 
Man-Android crossbreeds?” 

Bill swung his head to stare at 
him. “Hell, no! We hated each other. 
What made you ask that?” 

Tony shrugged. He had to be 
careful with Bill; double-think- every- 
thing before he said it. “I just won- 
dered. It was possible, wasn’t it? 
Their chromosomes are modeled af- 
ter ours . .” 

“Were,” Bill Jackson said with 
firm assurance. “And that’s a lot of 
bunk. Bull!” 

“But—” 

Bill’s face became ugly, his eyes 
flaring like glass in the moonlight. 
The lines from his nostrils to the 
corners of his mouth were harsh 
and deep. D’you think any man 
would? Would you bed one of 
them?” 

Tony thought of the warty thing 
they had killed and he shuddered 
and shook his head. “No, I guess 
not. Bill. Anyhow, it doesn’t matter, 
now. We killed it. There’s nobody 
left. Just you and me.” 

Above his head a Great Horned 
Owl, filled with the smug assurance 
that he was not the last of his kind, 
hooted his derision.

T he last surviving android walked 
from the shadows of the woods 
and stood before the campfire kin- 
dled by the last two surviving men. 

Its face was an ugly travesty of a 
human female’s; broad, warty, wor- 
thy of Hogarth’s worst satire. The 
lips, thin and twisted, writhed back 
from yellowish teeth. For just a mo- 
ment it stared at the two prone fig- 
ures in their sleeping-bags by the 
popping fire; then it approached 
them with the stealth of the Un- 
human. Its big, almost-human hands 
swung loosely at its sides, empty; 
weaponless — and Bill Jackson 
charged from behind the blue-and- 
silver corpse of a wrecked scout- 
plane. The penultimate survivor of 
Earth’s slaughtered billions lunged 
with bayonet fixed to empty rifle. 

He learned quickly that the An- 
droid had not been duped by the 



10 



IF 




grass-stuffed dummies lying by the 
campfire. With reflexes designed by 
Man to be faster than men’s, it 
whirled, poised for just an instant 
and ran. It plunged through the little 
wall of buckbushes and crashed 
noisily off through the conifer for- 
est. 

Bill Jackson gazed after it, bewil- 
dered. “Well, I’ll be damned! First 
time I ever saw one of them run 
from anything!” He walked to the 
base of a tall fir. He looked up 
through the ragged branches at the 
pale face peering down from a plat- 
form. “Didn’t work,” Bill Jackson 
said. “After all that trouble, it didn’t 
work!” 

Tony Baker, former Scoutcraft 
pilot in the terrible war the An- 
droids called “Civil” and the men 
called “The War Against the As”, 
slid down the rope from the plat- 
form to the ground. “I was afraid of 
that. Bill.” He was a younger man, 
slimmer, his face not yet set in the 
lines with which age and hate and 
experience had creased Bill’s dark 
face. 

“It should have!” Bill said. His 
manner was that of a small boy. “All 
that practicing with the rope, all that 
cutting the branches and fixing the 
clearing -just right, all that damned 
grass we cut to stuff those dummies 
. damn! All this work for noth- 
ing!” 

“Not quite for nothing,” Tony 
Baker said. He looked beyond the 
fire to the almost-finished cabin, 
roofed just today, at the camp’s 
north end; back to the two grass 
dummies sprawled in their sleeping- 
bags; finally back to Jackson. “We 



learned how smart they are, Bill,” 

“Uh-huh. Hell, we’re menV 

“Yeah,” Tony Baker said. He 
pulled the rope — on which he was 
to have swung ..down upon the An- 
droid — back to the bole of the Doug- 
las fir, secured it lightly on the 
nail they had driven there. He re- 
turned his pale blue eyes to ti'ie big 
man. 

4 4T>ill, look. I know you’re older, 

A) but I’ve seen more action 
against these things than you have; 
they grabbed me when I was seven- 
teen and put a uniform on me.” He 
plucked at the blue and silver shirt 
under the mackinaw; the nights were 
chill. “They gave me a gun and they 
said ‘Go, boy, go kill Androids.’ 
That’s what I did for three years, 
until they found out about my fly- 
ing lessons — I’d tried to tell ’em — 
and they quickied me through flight 
school and put me in poor ole Brig- 
itte over there.” He waved a hand 
at the scoutcraft, a USAF S-195 that 
had brought him crashing down to 
Bill Jackson. “I was in the Alamo 
Division, at the Third Battle of 
Johnson City. The immune divi- 
sion, remember? Yeah, immune. 
The As let go their bacterigas and in 
six days there were Jack and Chris 
and I. Then — ” 

“Don’t lecture me, fella! I did 
some fighting myself.” And Bill 
talked about it as Tony grinned. He 
hadn’t intended to get into it again, 
but both men were tense — and 
though war might be hell, man has 
never ceased to want to talk about 
it. “But because I knew the country 
up here and liked it they made me

boss of a work detail. We were im- 
mune too. I buried ’em all. Then I 
started carving out this clearing . 
and zoom!" Down comes a flyboy, all 
shiny and silver and blue. Nice of 
you, at that. That little toy plane 
makes a nice barrier across the 
south side of the clearing. Damn 
good thing for you, too. If I hadn’t 
pulled you out, you’d be dead, 
Sport. That Android woulda found 
you . that’s how it found us, I 
guess. Lord knows how far away it 
was, but it homed in on your plane.” 
From Bill Jackson’s lips the word 
Android emerged as the foulest 
curse. 

Tony raised a hand to the back of 
his head with a boyish grin; he’d re- 
moved the bandage only today. 
“You’re right. Bill.” He looked 
around at the little camp. Home. 
“And you know I appreciate it.” 

“I wasn’t fishing.” 

“I know it. I was thinking about 
us — the clearing, the cabin, the 
trap. Even if it didn’t work. Creativ- 
ity. That’s the one thing the As 
don’t have, creativity. The poisoned 
rains they used on us, the radio fre- 
quencies, the mutated parasites — 
every one of ’em a human invention. 
We should be able to get it. We 
gave ’em everything but creative- 
ness.” 

B ill walked over and bent to heft 
a log and place it carefully on 
the low fire. “Creativity . we’re 
gonna need that. Sport. D’you real- 
ize we’re probably all that’s left? 
You and me and that Android?” He 
looked at Tony and the thought hit 
him and he sat quickly. 



Tony came over to the fire and 
squatted, then sat with a grunt on 
the ground. He unbuttoned one shirt 
pocket, took out the last earthly re- 
mains of a wilted pack of wilted cig- 
arettes. He peered in; old Mother 
Hubbard examining the cupboard, 
hopefully. “Two,” he told Bill. “Let’s 
split one.” Bill nodded and Tony, 
thinking of creativeness, creation, re- 
creation, recreation, procreation, 
drew a burning sliver from the fire 
and lighted the cigarette slowly, not 
wasting a milliliter 6t tobacco by 
burning it off. He inhaled with the 
long, sucking draw of a man who 
knows he hasn’t long to keep the 
habit. He handed the Tiger to Bill. 

“You flyboys and your Tigers,” 
Bill muttered. “If you’d smoked fil- 
ters we wouldn’t have to use the 
pin.” But he grinned to let Tony 
know he was kidding. Tony had 
unlaced and slipped off one of his 
cleated boots. He bent now to ex- 
amine his foot. Bill hunched for- 
ward to look. 

“You still worried about bugs?” 

Tony smiled. Bugs! Well, “Bacter- 
iological agents” was quite a mouth- 
ful. “Yeah, some. But it’s been al- 
most three years since there was 
anything new being spread. Just my 
luck to get ringworm or athlete’s 
foot.” 

“Nah,” Bill said, peering at the 
wrinkled foot. “Just a rub-blister, 
’sail. Too much flying and not 
enough walking. I think you and I 
can figure we’re immune to anything 
there is, by now. Survival of the fit- 
test — that’s us.” 

Tony found himself unable to 
smile as he took off the other boot 



12 



IF 




and walked, barefoot, to the plane 
for his sneakers. The ground felt 
good; cold and invigorating to hot 
feet. He came back to pull the white 
sneakers on by the fire. He looked 
up as Bill held out the cigarette. 
“Here. I’m one up on you — I took 
another drag while you got those 
slippers.” 

Tony inhaled deeply. “Well, my 
doctor didn’t approve anyhow. He’s 
— he was an AMAist — a lung-can- 
cerist . Bill? You know that one 
we chased off tonight’s the fittest of 
her kind.” 

“Her? Its.” Bill said, snarling. 
“Its.” 

“Okay. D’you realize we set the 
trap, we plotted, waited to kill it 
like two tigers? And it came un- 
armed.” 

“Sure. At night, sneaking. And 
Androids are twice as strong as we 
are, remember. It didn’t need wea- 
pons.” 

“Well, it’s odd it didn’t have a 
club or something.” Tony frowned. 
“Maybe it wanted to make peace,” 
he said. “Maybe we’re not supposed 
to kill it.” 

“What’s that mean? ‘Not supposed 
to’? Who’s making the rules? We’re 
it. Sport.” 

Tony^Baker cautioned himself be- 
fore he spoke. “There’s just you and 
me and that Android, Bill. A female 
Android. With fallopian tubes. Man’s 
gone; maybe Mother Nature’s got 
control again. She’s determined to 
keep old man going.” 

Bill snorted. “You want to put 
on your Sunday-go-to-meeting 
clothes and go out to find that 
A, smoke the peace-pipe? I promise 



I’ll bury you — or whatever’s left of 
you, if I find it.” He stood and 
turned away; even the set of his 
shoulders and his stiff back were a 
sneer. 

T ony knew there was no use ar- 
guing. There was little arguing 
with Bill Jackson at any time, and 
particularly not when he knew he 
was right. As when he’d thought of 
the rope business. They’d spent hours 
trimming the bole of the big fir, 
building the platform, securing the 
rope, practicing, with Bill talking ex- 
citedly and whistling and humming 
like Orville Wright tightening the 
last nut on his brainstorm. 

Tony glanced at the useless Scout- 
er and sighed. “Yeah, I’ll take the 
first watch, Bill.” 

“Yeah ... get plenty of sleep, 
and tomorrow we can go hunting. 
Okay by me,” Bill said. He dumped 
dampish, browning grass out of his 
sleeping bag and crawled into it, 
boots and all. He was snoring, bear- 
like, before Tony reached the plane. 
Its open cabin doorway was an ex- 
cellent place from which to keep 
watch. 

He stopped. 

Had there been a movement? Re- 
flection from the flames? He stared 
till his eyes began to bum, holding 
his breath as he listened, then clos- 
ed them tightly and glanced back at 
the fire. He went over to the com- 
bination barrier-breakwater-woodpile 
to bring more logs closer to the fire 
— and stopped again. 

Reflection? Or another movement, 
there by the S-195? His hand grip- 
ped hard around the rifle stock and

he glanced at Bill, the fire. Then he 
stepped up to the woodpile, his eyes 
on the plane. He did not take them 
off it, squatting, setting the rifle 
against a pile of logs, reaching out 
blindly to stack one, two, three 
smaller logs in the curve of his left 
arm. Hugging them against his chest 
he picked up the bayoneted rifle 
again, rose slowly and took a hesi- 
tant step toward the campfire. And 
another — 

And an arm clamped around his 
throat. He was jerked back, his voice 
cut off, the wood spilling, bouncing 
painfully off his toe. The rifle was 
yanked from his hand and dropped 
to the ground. He raised both hands 
to the powerful band around his 
neck, clutched it. 

Blam! 

Ill 

H e awoke, shaking his head, 
frowning and trying to move 
his arms until he realized they were 
bound behind his back. He was sit- 
ting on a pile of old grass, sour- 
smelling, in darkness. His head 
throbbed . Efill! The Android! It 
had him; it had grabbed him from 
behind, must’ve banged him on the 
head! Now where — as he looked 
around, wrinkling his nose, straining 
his eyes in an effort to make them 
acclimate faster, he realized he was 
in a cave. 

It had not killed him! 

As his eyes became accustomed to 
the cave’s faintly moonlit darkness 
he found it, squatting against the 
rock wall to the right of the grassy 
pallet on which he lay. It moved 



now to his side. It made placating, 
appealing gestures with a horny 
hand and stretched its lips in a gro- 
tesque caricature of a smile. Its 
eyes were reassuring, questioning. 
Slowly it leaned forward and raised 
the hand. Slowly it removed the gag 
in his mouth. 

He yelled. 

The sound reverberated loud in 
the cave. He yelled again, as the 
Android squatted beside him, re- 
garding him in silence. It showed no 
reaction to the noise.' Then it extend- 
ed a hand — slowly, in the careful 
manner one adopts with wary ani- 
mals to put them at ease — and 
touched his throat, his mouth. It 
frowned and raised the hand to its 
own mouth, then its throat. Its lips 
wriggled as it remembered. First 
there came a gurgling growl from its 
throat, then a voice. It sounded fa- 
miliar but Tony Baker did not recog- 
nize it as his own. 

“Sound does not go out of the 
cave, Man. We rounded a corner. 
See, the moonlight is reflecting in on 
us.” 

Tony stopped yelling. 

“Man. You and that other Man 
are the last of your kind. The very 
last. And . and I am the last 
Android.” 

He stared at it. He had known it, 
he and Bill had said it. But now 
someone — something — else was say- 
ing it, and it sounded horrible. The 
thought caught him, swarmed over 
his brain, ran down the corridors of 
his mind, shrieking. He put out his 
tongue to wet his lips. 

“I had to get away from . 
other Man. I am sorry I had to hurt

IF 




you. We must talk. Android and 
Man should not destroy each other. 
wShould not fight. Both kinds are 
gone: destroyed because they did 
not talk, did not think. We three 
have no reason to hate, to kill.” It 
paused, waited. When Tony said 
nothing it went on, in his voice: 
“Other Man — Bill? would never 
talk. We must. And I am not in- 
terested in Bill Jackson.” 

I t had listened to them, he real- 
ized. It had been out there, lis- 
tening to us talk, this poor earnest 
creature, he sympathized — no, em- 
pathized — with it and its efforts, 
its earnestness. He made a face and 
blinked as he moved his head and 
it informed him it did not wish to 
be moved. A not-quite-human An- 
droid hand rose to touch his fore- 
head where tawny hair bubbled 
over. He tried not to flinch. 

“Your head hurts ... I am sorry. 
I do not want to hurt you or to be 
hurt. I did not bring you here to 
torture you.” 

“Didn’t you?” It wasn’t much and 
it sounded pretty silly, he knew, but 
at least he’d said something. 

“Oh no!” The asymmetrical head 
wagged. “No! Androids are not sad- 
ists.” » 

“Look, I’ve been fighting An- 
droids seven years. That isn’t the 
way I’ve heard it.” 

“Propaganda,” the Android said. 
“Our leaders lied to us. Your lead- 
ers lied to you. Enemies are not 
told truth about each other. No, we 
are not sadists, not even cruel. Man 
and Android were — are much alike. 
But not that much alike.” 



Ouch, Tony Baker thought, and ' 
he looked away and swallowed. 
“Look, I said I’ve been fighting 
seven years. In war. I was a soldier, 
then a pilot. I’ve killed Androids. 
I’ve killed a lot of Androids. If 
you’re going to kill me, let’s do it.” 

It shook its head again. “I have 
killed, too: Men. It was hard, kill- 
ing gods. But not now. I will not 
kill you. I could have. Remember I 
could have killed you there and then 
the other . Bill.” 

True enough, Tony Baker thought. 
“All right — what are you called?” 
“Androids have no names. I am 
SA-562-0.” It touched the numbers 
on the pocket of the green uniform- 
blouse it wore. Men had learned it 
did no good to brand Androids; their 
fantastic body-control threw off even 
tattooing. 

“All right, then, SA. That’s no 
name, but we’ll worry about it later. 
Sally, maybe. All right: we’re at 
war. Our leaders declared war. And 
neither you nor I have been mustered 
out.” He frowned. He felt silly, but 
it seemed somehow to need to be 
done: “As a representative of the 
government of the United States and 
of Earth — the only representative, 
bar one — I declare truce. No. I de- 
clare peace.^" 

‘ The smile was horrible, and he 
tried again not to show his revulsion 
for the pitiful surrogate-woman. “As 
only representative of Android race 
of Earth, I, too, declare peace.” 

E yes met for a moment; skyblue 
human eyes and greenish al- 
most-human eyes. Then the android 
reached around and untied him. He

rubbed his wrists, sitting up, arching 
his aching back. 

It sat back, watching him. Dog- 
like, he thought. Dogs worship with 
their eyes. Cats stare. We’re the cats. 

“Do you know how much it hurts 
us, Man, to war with Men? We have 
always stood in awe of Men. Living 
gods who created us. We could not 
forget that.” 

“Yet you were able to go to war, 
to kill men. To exterminate them.” 
He choked on the words, trying not 
to sound accusing.. 

“We did not begin that way. We 
fought because we had to. Man be- 
gan to fear us and tried to limit us 
so as to hold us as slaves. But he 
had given us the power to reproduce, 
just as he did. Believe me, Man, 
please believe me, androids had no 
thought of wiping out Man. I think 



if we had thought that we would 
not have fought. It terrified us 
to realize we were causing Men 
to die.” And the creature shuddered. 
Tony stared. “Men are the creators,” 
it said, in that same quiet voice, the 
sad voice of Tony Baker. Suddenly 
he realized it. 

“That’s my voice!” 

It nodded. “We are not creative; 
we are imitative. Man could not give 
us creativeness ... or did not. 
Would you rather that I used his 
voice?” 

“No . and call me by my 
name: Tony Baker. You are a fe- 
male; use a female voice.” It 
frowned, and he realized it was try- 
ing to remember. “Uh — movies . 
television . Stella Steele! You 
know Stella Steele?” 

It looked at him frowning, then 






beamed and nodded. “Yes,” Stella 
Steele’s sensuously childlike voice 
said, and he had to gasp. 

“Lord! That’s her voice.” He 
thought about what he’d tried not to 
think about. Women. Stella Steele. 
He remembered her fabulous clothes, 
her smile, her glorious figure; re- 
membered, too, how she’d looked in 
the uniform the night she appeared 
on every screen everywhere, Amer- 
ica’s successor to Bara and Harlow 
and Mdnroe and Loren and Nickel 
and Vinci. Uniformed, golden hair 
tumbling from under a field-cap, ex- 
horting all the men of the world — 
her subjects — to fight and fight on 
for their girls and wives and moth- 
ers; and for Stella Steele, their 
dreamgirl. He shook his head viol- 
ently, trying to blot out that im- 
age, trying nott to think of the 



sad announcement amid tapping 
drums and against a black backdrop, 
the announcement that Stella Steele 
had been killed in the Battle of Palo 
Alto. It had been worse than the 
deaths of the presidents; Tony Baker 
and his cohorts had not been fight- 
ing for the presidents. He shook his 
head again, blinked tearily, and said 
nostalgically : 

“We could have built a fine civ- 
ilization together.” His words stum- 
bled as they emerged. 

“We still can, Tonybaker,” Stella 
Steele’s voice said from the appari- 
tion in the cave. 

Silence. Silence broken finally by 
the not-quite-human creation of 
Man, as she folded her arms beneath 
womanish — and yet uninteresting — 
breasts. “Men . and androids . 
were . are . interfertilc.”

'^■^here was silence again. He 
A blinked. “And that’s why you 
brought me here.” 

“Yes.” The eyes were intensely 
appealing, pleading. 

“No.” He shook his head. “No. 
I’m sorry . .but no, I can’t.” 

The android with the voice of the 
world’s dead goddess of love leaned 
back, sorrow showing in both its 
pitiful face and lumpy body. “Then 
you are the last Man. Can you not 
see, Man, god, what I see? We do 
one of three things. We kill each 
other, we live apart and die and 
leave Earth to the birds and the in- 
sects and the lesser animals. Or we 
— join — to bring Man back to 
Earth.” Her voice rose a trifle as 
he started to interrupt. “Perhaps our 
offspring would be as strong, as in- 
telligent as the Android . but with 
Man’s creative potential. Still Man — 
but a new Man. A superior Man!” 
“No.” 

“Androids — ” it was feeling for 
words, frowning its cerebral process 
— “Androids were denied something 
else. We do not possess the high de- 
gree of esthetic appreciation Man 
does. It does not enter our minds, 
usually. But is it — this?” The mis- 
shapen hand gestured at the mis- 
shapen body, the misshapen head 
and gynecomorphous features. “The 
thought of mating with me? It means 
only shallow physical revulsion?” 
“Look,” Tony Baker said, turning 
away, feeling ashamed and terribly 
in the wrong but unable to help him- 
self. “Call it shallow if you will, but 
it’s there. Yes. That’s why it can’t 
be.” Now his voice was as sad as 
hers. 



“Men had a saying about beauty,” 
that marvelous voice said behind 
him, and he shivered. “It was only 
skin deep, you said. So is ugliness, 
Tonybaker.” 

He nodded his tortured head, 
ashamed to turn and face the sad 
creature behind him. He heard its 
shuffling movements. Irrational, he 
thought, unrational, he told himself, 
and yeah, he told himself, but know- 
ing that doesn’t help any. Again, un- 
able to control it he felt the shiver 
dance up his back. 

“You cannot forget?” 

“Forget? If I were blind, perhaps. 
No, not even then. I can feel, touch. 
That esthetic sense you mentioned 
applies to all the senses of man. We 
can see, and feel, and hear, and . 
just now I hear Stella Steele. I know 
she is dead, but I hear Stella Steele. 
That sense is satisfied. Lord, it’s 
sated, staring at the wall and just 
hearing the voice like this. But I can 
still see, feel, touch, I can still 
smell — ” 

“Then if you cannot change your 
mind, we are lost, both of us, and 
both our races. But if this is super- 
ficial, Tonybaker ... if it exists in 
the senses, as you say . .” 

H er tone made him turn. “My 
God!” was ripped from his 
throat as he stumbled back painfully 
against a rock wall, dumbfounded 
by the sight that greeted his eyes. 

She smiled, a gentle curving up of 
the ends of pink lips, a crinkling of 
the smooth flesh around wide green 
eyes, a wrinkling of a small, unfin- 
ished-appearing little nose. She put 
her head on one side and blonde

hair swirled; hair the color of straw 
and honey and the setting sun. She 
raised a hand — a delicate, tapering 
hand with smooth, undying flesh, 
to the straining fabric of the breast 
of her blouse; fabric straining and 
shining smoothly, tightened by the 
taut-pushing elliptical shapes be- 
neath. She shifted one leg, and the 
uniform slacks were a tense sheen 
over round thighs and Vargas calves. 

She was Stella Steele.

B ill still slept, snoring, lying peace- 
fully on his back near the fire. 
Tony stood over him, watching the 
magnificence of Stella Steele’s back 
moving away into the trees. She dis- 
appeared, and he looked down at 
Bill. With the bayoneted rifle 
clutched in both hands Tony watched 
the rise and fall of Bill’s massive 
chest. He’ll never understand, Tony 
thought. I’ll either have to kill him 
or just — leave. And dear God, how 
do I do either? This guy saved my 
life! With a wrenching jerk of his 
arms he tossed the weapon away and 
dropped to one knee.” 

“Bill.” 

“Umph?” 

Bill awoke with a suddenness that 
brought him to a wide-eyed sitting 
position, his head snapping about in 
search of danger. Finally he looked 
at Tony. “You didn’t wake me for 
my watch!” he accused. “It’s nearly 
dawn.” He scrabbled around, getting 
himself out of the sleeping-bag. 

“I’ve been thinking. Bill.” 

“Yeah, you sure have. You let 
the fire go out.” Bill stretched his 



big frame while Tony checked the 
fire; it wasn’t out. “Thinking about 
what?” Bill asked. 

“Bill, there’s you, and there’s me 
. and that’s all. Except for the 
Android.” 

“I’m listening. Sport.” There was 
a warning note in Bill’s voice. Tread 
lightly, it said; and Tony trod light- 

ly- 

“We both know — we all three 
know that men and Androids can 
produce offspring. And — ” 

“Uh-huh. A half-breed. A little 
monster, not a man, not an A. And 
what’s the percentage. Sport? They’d 
probably be sterile hybrids to boot!” 

“Bill, we don’t know. Either the 
human race dies with you and me 
or we try and keep it going — 
through that Android. Suppose there 
was a kid. Or ten. Suppose they 
were men with an Android’s 
strength and reasoning power? 
They’d be better men than you and 
I are.” 

“I say bull! And I say this, too, 
Tony: which of us is going to 
impregnate that wartfaced monster 
and which one of us is going to 
hold the bayonet on her? Look, I’ll 
take that part.” 

Dammit! Bill meant that both 
ways Tony thought; he’d rather kill. 
“Bill, it would beat living in an 
unpopulated world and knowing 
that when we die it all dies. There’s 
no more men. And no more And- 
roids, either.” 

“You got it for that goblin, huh? 
Well, I haven’t. And I be damned 
if I’ll let you. Don’t try to feed 
me that human race stuff. You just 
need a woman — or the nearest

thing. That thing. He waved at the 
woods. 

“That’s not true, damn you! I — ” 

B ill knocked him down with one 
stride and one swing. Tony 
looked up at him. “Now just what 
the hell ...” 

Bill Jackson picked up the bayon- 
eted rifle and flipped it into his 
left hand and reached up to his 
shirt pocket with his right. “Here, 
I’ll show you something.” He toss- 
ed a small leather case to the other 
man. 

Tony opened it. There were two 
pictures, two smiling faces: a wom- 
an’s and Bill’s. He looked up again. 

“Mom,” Bill said, in a voice that 
was quiet and harsh. “My mother. 
Dad died when I was seven, but 
she raised me by herself. She was 
a strong woman, bless her. Stronger 
than Dad ever was. I loved her 
... I owed her ever3^hing. Would 
vou like to hear how she died, 
Tony?” 

Tony stored the revelation away 
in a corner of his mind. “No, but 
Bill— ” 

“That tell you why I’ll never 
make peace? \^y I’ll kill the last 
damned Android if I can — and kill 
you before I’ll let you filthy your- 
self with it?” 

“Bill, I — no! Look out!” 

Too late. The heavy rock the 
beautiful gifl held and swung with 
one delicate hand crashed into the 
back ^ of Bill Jackson’s head with a 
chunking, squishing sound. His eyes 
were wide and surprised as he 
stiffened and jerked and toppled 
forward toward Tony. He smashed 



to the ground and Tony saw that 
blood and gray brainstuff were 
streaming from the back of a head 
split like a ripe watermelon. 

“Damn you!” Tony got to his 
knees and searched, his eyes blind- 
ed by tears, for the rifle Bill had 
dropped. He grasped it and she 
jumped back. 

“I’m sorry,” she said. “You said 
he’d never give in. Why did you 
have to come back?” She was cry- 
ing a woman’s tears. “You heard 
what he said! He’d have Jcilled both 
of us!” 

“Damn you! Damn you Bill, 
damn you Stella — ” Tony caught 
a deep breath and said very quiet- 
ly: “Come here. Android.” 

His voice was low and ugly. She 
shook her head — and he made a 
rush for her. 

She eluded him. Android reflexes 
still driving the movie-star body, 
running across the clearing. Sudden- 
ly he stopped; she turned to look 
back at him, tears glistening on her 
cheeks. 

“You will change your mind. 
After you have buried your worst 
enemy, you will change your mind. 
And when you do, you’ll be able to 
find me.” 

“Never! Get away and stay away! 
If you stay away from me maybe 
I c^n persuade myself not to find 
you and kill you.” 

She shook her head and smiled 
a tiny smile and golden-blonde hair 
flew. “You’ll change your mind, 
Tonybaker.” And she was gone. The 
beautiful, beautiful Android was 
gone and Bill was gone, and Tony 
stood there, sobbing.

S he met him at the mouth of the 
cave three days later. They 
looked at each other in silence. 

He hadn’t wanted to come. He 
still didn’t want to do it. But he 
was a man. Bill was dead. He had 
to be and think and act a man. 
Slowly she raised her feminine 
hands, lovely, empty hands. Slowly 
he raised his, palms up and empty. 

“I came,” Tony said. “For a new 
beginning.” 

She nodded. “I have waited for 
a new beginning.” She flashed a 
beauty queen’s smile at him and 
he swallowed. 

“What shall I call you?” 

She shrugged. And one magni- 
ficently molded breast bounded and 
shuddered. 

“You need a name . SA for 
Synthetic Android . silly re- 
dundance . Sally, maybe . 
no, Synthy. Synthetic Synthy.” 

She smiled. “That’s better than 
Sinny,” she said, and she laughed, 
a girl’s lovely laugh, bubbling from 
her throat like a silvery spring from 
a mountainside. Tony Baker raised 
a hand to touch her face. 

She jumped back. He frowned, 
hesitated, then .took a step forward, 
his eyes asking a question. 

“I — I’m changed, remember? 
I’m not Sa-562-Q any more, but 
I’m not Stella Steele either. I’m — 
I’m a girl ... as if I were just 
born. I’m sorry. Wait. Please wait 
— count to ten. Then come in.” 

She went into the cave. He 
watched her walk, sighing, thinking 
about her and himself and Bill and 



what it was to be a man. To be 

Man. 

Then he counted on, to twenty, 
to be sure, and went into the cave 
and around the corner into the 
little rock room where she had 
ceased — outwardly — to be a thing. 
He stumbled. He caught himself 
with one hand against cool stone 
and looked down. He had stumbled 
over her clothing. He stood still, 
waiting for his eyes to acclimate to 
dimness. 

She knelt on the grassy pallet — 
no, there was new grass there now, 
not sour and brown — where he’d 
Iain, bound, three nights ago. Her 
hair streamed down over naked 
shoulders. She was exquisitely beau- 
tiful. She raised her arms, and he 
went to her and dropped to his 
knees and slipped his arms around 
her warm, soft waist. 

He reached back and slipped the 
bayonet from his boot and shoved it 
very deftly between her shoulder- 
blades. 

Her scream became a gurgle in 
his ear as she lunged against him, 
arching her back, trying to escape 
the searing steel tearing away her 
life. Her arms tightened about him, 
her hands clutched at him; clutched 
and rose to his throat — then she 
shuddered and fell back, pulling 
him with her. He felt his arm 
break just as he felt unhuman fin- 
gers begin to close. 

He screamed. Once. '

eat at yourself, Bill. Me, I’m going 
to try and make peace with that 
Android out there. If I can.” He 
decided against saying anything fur- 
ther about her, about what she had 
become. 

Bill lowered the rifle. “I won’t 
let you go. Sport.” 

“Going to kill me?” 

Bill hesistated. 

“You’ll have to. Bill. And what’s 
the gain in that? You’ll just be 
alone . and what’ve you ac- 
complished?” 

“I’ll have saved you.” 

“Bill, I don’t think you’re in- 
terested in saving me. Not from any- 
thing, anyhow. You’ve just got a 
blind spot, like some people had in 
the last century, down South.” 
“That’s a lie! You’re a man, my 
friend! I just can’t let you — ” 

“Let me what? Attempt the one 
thing that’s sensible?” 

B ill Jackson narrowed his eyes and 
turned his head slightly, look- 
ing at the other man from the edges 
of his eyes. “You’ve seen her, 
haven’t you? While I was asleep. 
That’s why you didn’t wake me 
for my watch. You weren’t here.” 
Tony nodded without speaking. 

“I won’t allow it, Tony!” 

“You can’t stop it. Bill. So long. 
Bill.” 

And then the big man lunged, 
leaping across the clearing with the 
bayonet fixed. Tony dived to one 
side, leaving a leg behind for Bill 
to stumble over. Tony scrambled 
to his feet and slammed one foot 
down on the rifle barrel. For a 
moment they were still, the fallen 



man staring at the other one. 

“You’re not a bad guy. Bill,” 
Tony said. “But ...” 

“I’ll kill you,” Bill Jackson told 
him, very quietly, without attempt- 
ing to rise. He wasn’t stupid; the 
younger man’s lithe agility and 
speed matched his big strength,'^ and 
he knew it. 

Tony Baker shook ’ his head. 
“You’ll get over it.” 

Then as Bill started to move the 
beautiful blonde who had been an 
Android moved in fast and looped 
a vine around his legs. They left 
him with the bayonet stuck in the 
ground like a marker, knowing he 
could get at it to free himself. 

“Sure she’s great-looking, Tony! 
Sure she’s beautiful!” Bill shouted, 
and his voice was almost a sob. “But 
she’s still not a she; she’s an it, an 
Android. She’s tricking you! She’s 
worse than a woman!” Then, as they 
went on, leaving him, his voice 
descended and he said very quietly, 
“I’ll get you. I’ll get you both.” 
And he did, three days later, in 
a deadfall he had arranged not far 
from the cave.

T ony picked up the rifle again, 
rose slowly, and took a cautious 
step back toward the campfire — 
And swung at a definite sound 
behind him. As his jaw muscles 
relaxed, dropping his mouth open, 
so did the muscles of his arm go 
limp. 

Peering at him around the plane, 
clearly vteible ia a pale corridor of 
moonlight, was a face. A girl’s love- 
ly face, framed by a mass of pale 
hair. She smiled, smiled and b^k- 
oned silently. He glanced back at 
BiU: snorifig. The rifle with its 
ugly steel snout ready, he went to 
her. Jt had to be the Android. But 
this was a girl. A beautiful girl! Had 
it — she — could she — 

She removed his doubts by an in- 
genuous question: “You like me 

now, Man?” 



He spoke across six feet of space. 
“Now? You’re the Android?” 

She shook her head and golden- 
blonde hair swirled. “We should not 
fight. You are the last Man. I am 
the last . female. When we die, 
there is nothing. No Men ... no 
Androids. Do you want that?” 

The enormity of It fell upon him. 
Not for the first time, no; but in 
its full implications, yes, for the 
first time. To the best of his knowl- 
edge she — it? She was right. There 
were no others. There was Bill Jack- 
son and there was Tony Baker and 
there was an Android . who 
was also a beautiful and extremely 
desirable girl. He had never seen 
an A look this way; it was hard to 
remember what she was. Where was 
the awful difference for which bil- 
lions had died? 

His voice was a hoarse whisper. 
“What — what are you called?” 

“Cynthe,” she said this time, 
remembering what he did not. The 
name plucked at his mind, sending 
questioning tendrils into his mem- 
ory banks; why did it seem familiar? 

She took a careful step toward 
him. “You may put the point of the 
bayonet — another step — “just 
here,” she said, and she raised one 
finger to touch one marvelous breast. 
“I shall die without resisting death.” 
Another step. “Or you may come 
with me, away from him,” and she 
took another step. Now she stood 
but a pace away, her hands at her 
sides, waiting within easy reach of 
the sliver of steel at the end of 
his rifle. He lifted it, watched its 
deadly gleam, watched the entice- 
ing rise and fall of her chest.

IF 




He dropped the rifle butt to the 
trail. Then as she turned and walked 
away, without looking back, he fol- 
lowed her into the trees. 

T he sun found Tony Baker study- 
ing the sleeping girl beside him, 
her hair a bright splash on the 
grass. He chewed his lip. 

He gazed at her, revolted by 
what she was, what she really was, 
yet not really revolted at all, but 
torn by his male need for a wom- 
an. Once satisfied, that need would 
return again, today, tonight, tomor- 
row, forming an addiction; and it 
would grow worse. Androids, she 
had told him, were adept at re- 
molding their pliant flesh. They 
possessed no specific facial features 
or even bodies of their own. They 
had been created from human plas- 
ma so that they were sort of mu- 
tated human stock, slightly closer 
to Man than Cro-Magnon had been. 
They were sturdier, more adaptable, 
than their creator, and imitative of 
his clever inventiveness. 

His valiant attempt at scientific 
detachment and the hodgepodge of 
scientific phrases did not work. He 
was looking down at a sleeping 
beauty, a lovely and fine-bodied girl. 
Her only fault lay in the fact that 
she was perhaps too perfect. Even 
in repose, sleeping peacefully on her 
back, the fantastic muscular struc- 
ture of the Android held her 
breasts nearly erect. And they 
would remain that way, he knew, 
still firm, years from now. Strange 
. her Unhumanity was reflected 
in her overperfection. He did not 
miss the irony. 



What would they do? Would they 
just start walking, leaving Bill, 
leaving this place, forgetting, or pre- 
tending to forget? Would they, could 
they, live idyllically and raise ba- 
bies? He did not know. And if she 
did conceive, if it were possible, 
what form would thedr child 
take? Would it represent the best 
of both man and Android? Or the 
worst? Man’s killing instinct rather 
than his creativity, perhaps? Would 
it be Man, or Android^ or Man- 
droid? He did not know. Would 
this represent the end of creativity? 

But otherwise it was the end of 
everything. He rose to his knees, 
studying her, and there came another 
thought. 

Could man trust Android? 

And then the obvious corollary, 
equally answerless: Could Android 
trust Man? 

There was fearful risk for both 
of them. She must be aware of it as 
I am, he thought. Each of us has had 
the opportunity to kill the other. 
Would this change? He stood, frown- 
ing. 

S he awoke. Her eys snapped open, 
her head turned, and wide- 
awake eyes looked into his. She 
smiled and held up a woman’s soft 
hand. He bent and took it and 
helped her up. He pulled her against 
him, holding her, looking at her, 
looking at and into and through 
her face. Then he stepped back, 
holding her at arm’s length. With 
something akin to prescience (wom- 
an’s intuition, transmitted to the 
almost-woman?), she understood and 
backed away. She met his gaze, not

i;;oving or speaking to interrupt his 
ifioughts. 

The dark spot appeared on her 
bare left breast at the same instant 
as the loud cracking sound slashed 
at his eardrums. She was hurled 
back, sprawling, and blood started 
bubbling from the sudden black 
hole. 

“It — it is through the heart,” 
she said, in a low, straining voice. 
“Uncanny markmanship or uncanny 
luck. Man’s luck. I — I cannot live. 
I’m sorry ... so sorry. I wanted to 
love you ... we could have . .” 
Her mouth stopped moving as her 
eyes ceased seeing. 

He turned to watch Bill Jackson 
running toward him from the for- 
est, the rifle ready in his hands for 
another shot. He started up the 
grassy hill Tony and Cynthe had 
climbed, hand in hand, the night 
before. 

“Damn close call, Sport! Lucky 
lor you I found you — and that I 
been saving these three bullets in 
my pocket. I couldn’t’ve got up here 
in time. Lord, she was less than 
ten feet away!” He reached Tony’s 
side and heaved a deep breath. 
“Look, next time you decide to 
take an early morning stroll without 
taking me along — don'tr He grin- 
ned a savior-hero’s grin and then 
looked down at the girl’s body, 
sprawled on its back, one knee 
bent. “Whew! Got a cigarette? 1 
sure could use one.” 

“No^ Bill. They’re gone; we 
smoked the last one.” 

“So it changes its shape, huh? 
Tried to trick you. But that Android 
strength was still there.” He shook 



his head. “You’d have found out, 
boy! Embracing that would’ve been 
like hugging a boa constrictor!” He 
shook his head again. “Yeah, they 
change . some woman, huh? Wish 
we could find a real woman like 
this — this dirty Android trickster!” 
Suddenly he took a step forward 
and lunged, hooking the bayonet’s 
point in the soft belly, ripping it 
up in a red-welling channel. 

Tony watched the broad, tense 
back, listened to the other man’s 
cursing. Do you. Bill? Do 'you wish 
we’d find a girl, a real girl? Would 
you be as vicious and gleeful in 
what you’re doing if she were still 
in her old shape, warty and hideous. 
Bill old buddy? He shuddered, 
realized there were tears in his eyes, 
and raised a hand to brush them 
away.

4 4T will keep the name,” Cynthe 

X thought. “Cynthe . syn- 
thetic Cynthe. He gave it to me. 
He did not mean to kill me. He 
would not have done it. It was 
the other Man ... it is always the 
other Man.” 

This time the Android had re- 
acted with no surprise to her new 
situation: It was obvious that every 
time someone was killed, things 
. changed. Changed just enough 
so that it was all right again, so 
that there was another chance. She 
wondered how many chances there 
were, how many times she must 
know the terrible pain of death. But 
she had to have this new chance. 
She had to succeed, somehow. She 
knew but one goal, one purpose, 
one mission: Mankind. She sat, 

hands locked girlishly around her 
knees, thinking with the high in- 
telligence Man had given her. 

Should she find some way to 
kill the other man, secretly, so that 
the other . Tonybaker . did 
not know, so that it appeared to be 
an accident? Or should she try 
again to avoid him? But eluding 
him had failed, twice. He fought 
before he listened, with his poor 
brain, all tense and twisted up so 
that she could actually feel it. And 
it hurt. Was there no possibility of 
making peace with him? What was 
needed, she knew, was another male, 
a male of his sort. Or a special 
kind of female. But the other one 
. Tony; she rolled the name over 
her tongue, savoring its taste as a 
connoisseur savored good brandy. 



He was uncertain, torturing him- 
self mentally, trying to come to a 
decision, trying to shake off all he 
had learned both before and dur- 
iny the terrible war between her 
race and his. He did not really 
w'ant to kill. He was less driven 
by unthinking prejudice, possessed 
of more insight, more empathy. And 
he had need of her body. Her pink 
lips curved up at the corners as she 
remembered, thinking that were she 
truly a woMan, she would erupt in 
gooseflesh. 

At the thought her arms and legs 
prickled. 

She smiled at the thousands of 
tiny eruptions. Anything you can 
do, we can do better, she thought, 
and voluntarily. 

She did not know herself how 
she felt about mating with a Man. 
But if she could conceive by him, 
Man or Mandroid, it did not mat- 
ter. If this could happen, and she 
was by then uncertain, after the 
long conditioned distrust and hate 
of war, she could take the child 
away and raise it alone. But how . 

A direct frontal assault! In day- 
light. A new day, this new body — 
yes! Cynthe stretched, deliciously, 
and lay back. Yes. Tomorrow. 

The last two men in the world 
sat on the bank of a trickle of 
water not big enough to be dis- 
tinguished by the name creek. 
Across the bank there was a clear- 
ing in the Oregon forest; across 
the clearing lay the crumpled 
wreckage of a small aircraft, a 
twisted hull of blue and gleaming 
silver. The last two men in the 



MANDROID 



27 




world were discussing the future, 
the immediate future. There was 
no long-term future. They had built 
a leanto, and now they had decided 
to build a cabin, there at the east 
end of the campsite which had be- 
come home. They smoked, handing 
a cigarette back and forth care- 
fully; Tony’s pack, now common 
property, contained only nine more. 

“Tell you something else,” the 
bigger man said. “Just in case we’re 
not the last — just in case some As 
survived — let’s pull up enough grass 
to stuff our sleeping bags. That way 
one of us can sleep while the other 

— Tony!” Bill Jackson pointed, big- 
eyed, across the clearing. “Look!” 

Tony Baker looked. Then he 
stood, stretching his wiry suppleness 
beside the huge strength of Bill 
Jackson. Emerging from the tree 
beside the S-195’s wreckage was a 
girl; a slender blonde girl with sway- 
ing hips and a bouncy chest be- 
neath a blouse and shorts made from 
what had been a uniform of some 
sort. 

“She — she looks a little like 
Stella Steele,” Tony said. 

“That Hollywood harlot!” Bill 
raised a hand to Tony’s arm. “Wait 

— she may not be what she looks 
like, Sport.” At Tony’s questioning 
look the older man said: “Android, 
Tony. They can change their ap- 
pearance. Remember their tricks 
during the war. We’d better be 
careful; have to figure a way to 
make sure she isn’t one of them.” 

T ony nodded, feeling the auto- 
matic revulsion which was a 
reflex action to the word Android. 



28 





But the revulsion was balanced by 
what he saw; the delightful swaying 
walk of a woman, the delightful 
jiggling of a female superstructure. 
A woman . how long had it 
been since he’d seen a woman? 
Funny . had he? He felt a . 
a half-memory . 

He watched her approach, half- 
hearing Bill: “We’ll have to cap- 
ture her, stay wary of her, test her, 
somehow.” 

“Uh-huh.” Tony didn’t take his 
eyes off the approaching girl. “Cap- 
turing her looks like no problem. 
Bill. She’s coming right to us. Lord, 
she’s smiling, too. Look at that! 
She doesn’t look as if she’s afraid 
of 

“Yeah. That doesn’t seem natural, 
does it? I mean if she was a girl, 
a real girl, she’d either be half- 



afraid of two men, or she’d be 
just the opposite. Running to us. 
She just looks — unconcerned. Like 
an A trying to trick us.” 

Tony smiled. “Well, it’s a cinch 
she shouldn’t be unconcerned. Boy, 
look at her!” 

They did, Tony wondering if Bill 
wanted the girl to be an A . 

why? He hadn’t known Bill long. 
The big man had been there, mir- 
aculously, to pull him out of the 
plane, to nurse him, watch over 
him while he raved, with the ugly 
gash in his head. The big man pos- 
sessed tenderness, Tony knew. But 
he was also possessed by what 
amounted to a pathological hatred 
of the Androids. 

They looked at her. 

She paused a few feet from the 
stream’s opposite bank, appearing 






suddenly uncertain as they failed 
to move or call out. She looked 
from Tony to Bill and back again, 
smiling a little girl’s smile from a 
little girl’s face above what was 
definitely not a little girl’s body. 
Her smile was brilliant, flashing, 
wide-open. She raised a hesitant 
hand in greeting. Slowly, equally 
hesitantly, Tony lifted his hand in 
silent reply. 

“Caution, boy, caution,” Bill said 
quietly. 

“Bill, she isn’t even armed** Tony 
said, and his voice sounded plaintive, 
even to himself. 

“Prove that,” Bill Jackson said. 
“What can you be sure of, where 
an Android’s concerned?” 

“// an A’s concerned.” 

Bill did not respond directly to 
that. “You talk to her,” he said. 
“Just talk to her. Leave the rest to 
me.” 

“But ...” 

“Talk to her, Tony, dammit!” 

T ony hesistated, then raised his 
voice. “Hi. We — uh, we 
thought we were the last people 
on Earth. Are — are there more of 
you?” Now thafs a dumb thing to 
say, he told himself. 

“No. No. No more. I — I thought 
I was the last. Thank God I’m not.” 
Again her smile dazzled him. Fum- 
bling, boyishly shy, he introduced 
himself and Bill. 

“I’m from Oregon, too,” she said. 
She -sounded vague, uncertain. “Do 
— do you have anything hot to 
drink?” 

“Together,” Bill said, and he gave 
Tony a little push down the bank. 



Behind him, as he scrambled down 
the slope and hopped the stream, 
Bill stood, pretending looseness and 
unconcern. But the rifle was ready 
in his hands. Tony knew that Bill 
could move fast for a big man with 
a barrel chest and a belly going gut- 
ty. He climbed the other bank and 
stopped at its summit as she backed 
away a couple of steps. He heard 
Bill’s boots clump as the other man 
bounded across the water and climb- 
ed up beside him. 

“Yeah,” Bill told hen. “We’ve got 
some acorn coffee — if you don't 
mind an occasional worm.” He 
grinned his big grin and walked 
toward her and on, his left hand 
hand rising to her shoulder to guide 
her along side him. Tony took three 
long steps to come up on her other 
side, wishing he’d thought of put- 
ting a hand on her shoulder. Dam- 
mit, he couldn’t now. From the 
corner of his eye he noticed what 
no man would fail to notice. She 
was a busty girl wearing a rather 
masculine green uniform-blouse with 
a lighter circle on her upper arm 
where a corps patched had been 
removed. One poked-out flap pocket 
had lost its button. Her shorts were 
fringed on one leg where the hem 
had frayed. He swallowed. She was 
even more stunning seen close. She 
was young, maybe his age, maybe 
twenty or younger, with very fair, 
very clear, smooth skin and a sort 
of funny nose. It was so little it 
appeared unfinished, cute,, and an 
outpoked lower lip that looked at 
once babyish and sensuous. 

Bill removed the bayonet from 
the rifle and pushed it carefully into 



30 



IF 




his boot-top. The rifle he handed 
to Tony. Then, without turning his 
back to the girl, he built up the 
fire and hung the pot on the wooden 
andirons they had rigged day be- 
fore yesterday. 

“We’re just naturally wondering 
how you came to be here and who 
you are,” he said, in the same casual 
tone he’d have used to remark on 
the weather. 

Tony knew the casual manner 
was false, and he reminded himself 
that no matter how good she looked 
with her long sun-colored hair Bill 
was right; she might be an A. And 
— and if she were? He frowned 
at that thought. 

“Are you?” Her voice reflected 
the same unconcern as Bill’s. Tony 
couldn’t help smiling. He sobered 
as Bill swung from the fire and 
stared at her. 

“Yes. We’d like to be sure you’re 
not on Android.” 

IX 

S he returned his gaze, wide-eyed 
and female, her lips almost 
but not quite smiling, as if the 
thought were so silly as to be ludi- 
crous. “You think I’m an And- 
roid?” 

Bill was suddenly unsure of him- 
self, and Tony couldn’t help an in- 
ward smile. He said nothing as Bill 
nodded. “You could be.” 

She raised her eyebrows, made a 
moue, and nodded her head on one 
side. “Now thafs not very flatter- 
ing, Mister Bill Jackson!” Her lips 
still looked as though they might 
be trying to laugh at him. “I’ve al- 



ways thought 1 looked pretty much 
like a girl.” Like a spectator at a 
tennis-match, Tony looked to Bill 
for his reply, then back to the girl 
as she spoke again. “May I sit 
down?” She was looking down at 
the two carefully smoothed logs they 
had positioned by the fire today. 

“Sure,” Bill said, “but first tell 
us your name . .” He trailed off, 
frowning, obviously nonplussed as 
she parked her pert rump on one 
of the logs. She smiled up at him 
and lifted one round shoulder which 
had an interesting effect on her 
blouse. “Cynthe.” 

“Cynthia? Cynthia what?” 
^'CyntheT she said again, and 
spelled it. “That’s all I remember. 
And I’m afraid I can’t tell you how 
I got here, either.” 

Tony came alive. “Amnesia, Bill? 
The war . surely an Android 
would have a better story than 
that.” 

“She doesn’t look like she had 
that kind of experience,” Bill said. 
“As to that other: you thought of 
it. An Android’s smart enough to 
know you’d think that — and have 
a story so unbelievable we’d buy it 
because it’s unbelievable. Like you 
just did.” 

How logical a man is when he 
wants to believe something, Tony 
Baker thought. But again Bill was 
right. Tony couldn’t decide if the 
big man were smarter than he, if 
he were stupid or in love or some- 
thing, or if Bill just wanted her 
to be an Android. 

“It’s a pretty name,” Tony said, 
and he received the reward he’d 
sought: a bright flash of smile.

“Um," Bill said, “Sounds like 
a showgirl’s name.” He watched her 
as she turned wide green eyes and 
the ingenuous smile on him. “You 
a showgirl?” He had hunkered down 
and pulled the bayonet from his 
boot. He squatted there, idly 
thumbing it. 

“B///!” Tony tried to keep from 
flushing; knew he was, felt his face 
warming. 

B ut the girl was unperturbed. “I 
guess that is a compliment,” 
she said, and then she frowned, a 
puckering of a smooth brow. “But 
I honestly don’t know. I might have 
been — I don’t know.” Her face 
brightened. “7 know — I could try 
to dance or sing to find out — or do 
a strip-tease!” Her face was ra- 
diant. Tony stared, thinking about 
the strip, trying not to eye the four 
buttons on her blouse. 

“Nah,” Bill said, quickly. “For- 
get it. That wouldn’t prove any- 
thing.” And Tony thought: damn 
jackass! Let her sing or dance or — 
he swallowed again. “Tony,” Bill 
said, still looking at the girl. “And- 
roids don’t give a damn if they’re 
naked or not. From what she just 
said, she doesn’t either.” 

“Ah, she was kidding,” Tony said, 
and wondered if she had been. 
“Look: if she were one of them, 
would she come here like this? An 
A doesn’t have to go to these 
lengths. If she were one she could 
have just waited till tonight and 
killed us.” 

“Maybe she intends to,” Bill said. 
“What’s the first thing you can 
remember, Cynthe?” 



She thought about it, pursing her 
lips. “Smoke. I smelled smoke. I 
came toward it — and came here.” 
She nodded at the campfire and 
waited for the next question. 

“That’s all? Hell, don’t you re- 
member yesterday? Or this morn- 
ing?” 

She shook her cloud of blonde 
hair. 

Tony thought of something for 
the first time. “Bill, how’d you know 
I wasn’t one? You didn’t put me 
through a question-and-answer ses- 
sion.” 

Bill looked at him with a crafty, 
superior smile. “I know. I tested 
you. You were unconscious, re- 
member? You’ve still got the lump 
on your head. And the scratch on 
your chest.” 

Tony nodded. “So? What d’ya 
mean, tested me?” 

“Okay, Sport, I’ll tell you.” Bill 
looked him directly in the eyes. 
“That bump came from the crash. 
The scratch on your chest came 
from this'' He raised the foot-and- 
more of tempered steel and wag- 
gled it. 

“You cut me? While I was out? 
Why?” 

“Tony, Androids can control their 
bodily processes, just like they can 
make themselves look any way they 
want. If you’d been an A you’d have 
healed immediately, and without any 
scab or scar. You’re wearing your 
proof right now. I saw the scab 
this morning.” And Bill turned 
and fixed the girl with the same 
steady gaze. Suddenly Tony wished 
he hadn’t asked. There was a long 
silence.

C ynthe broke it. “Tony, that’s 
boiling. Could I have a cup 
now?” The smile flashed, went 
away again as she turned to Bill. 
“Bill. Would you mind heating that 
bayonet? I don’t want to get in- 
fected.” 

“Cynthe!” Tony jerked around 
and the dark mud of surrogate cof- 
fee sloshed to hiss in the fire. “Bill! 
No!” 

Bill hadn’t moved. He was frown- 
ing. “Now an Android would never 
suggest that. Only a human would 
be willing to be cut ... to prove it. 
But an A would be smart enough to 
think just that . figger we’d ac- 
cept your willingness as proof 
enough ...” His frown vanished 
as he smiled. He rose. “Okay, Missy, 
ni heat the bayonet.” And he 
turned and picked up the rifle and 
affixed the blade to it. Then hold- 
ing the stock carefully, he pushed 
a couple of inches of bayonet into 
the fire. 

Tony stared at him. He was 
startled at the way Bill’s mind 
worked. The big man wasn’t stupid. 
He’d have made a good general — 
or a chess player. Tony had prac- 
tically heard the wheels turning as 
Bill had thought, then guessed, then 
second-guessed, then — he jerked his 
head around ^s the girl spoke, next 
to him. 

- “May I have that, Tony? I need 
some fortification.” Her fingers 
touched his hand as she took the 
steaming cup of acorn juice. Her 
hand was cool, soft. He wondered 
if it were always cool, or if she were 
about ten times as scared as she was 
acting. She smiled briefly at him 



over the cup’s lip as she raised it 
and bent her head to blow a cloud 
of steam. She watched it rise and 
eddy and dissipate. Then she walked 
over to stand across the fire from 
Bill, watching him turn the bayonet. 

Bill Jackson looked up at her. 
“Look, uh, Cynthe — nothing per- 
sonal, right? It’s just that we’ve got 
to be sure. And maybe you don’t 
even know. Maybe you’re hypno- 
tized. To make you actually believe 
you’re not an Android, I mean. 
Until — until something triggers you 
to remember and attack us. Like the 
moon, for instance. See?” 

She nodded in silence, raising the 
cup to sip, her eyes on the pink 
blade. It’s about the color of her 
lips, Tony thought, and he watched 
it glow redder. 

He tried to think of something 
to say, some way to stop the test. 
But he couldn’t think of a way. She 
was all right. She had to be. He 
watched the bayonet become a cher- 
ry red. They did not speak, all three 
of them staring fixedly at the sliver 
of sharp steel as its color crept 
along the spectrum from red into 
orange-yellow, then yellow. Bill 
stared, turning it in the fire with 
the same care he’d have exercised if 
the bayonet had spitted a fresh 
young rabbit. 

The blade was white. Bill removed 
it from the fire and looked at it as 
if hypnotized. He raised his eyes 
to the girl. 

“Any bugs on this have gone to 
meet their honorable ancestors by 
now,” he said, and Tony thought: 
The bastard’s trying to be light 
about it. He immediately felt em-

barrassed, and a little ashamed. This 
test had not been Bill’s idea. 

Or had it? 

T he girl nodded and walked 
around the fire to sit down on 
the log again, with some interesting 
jiggles. Tony wished he’d been 
standing behind her. He threw the 
thought out of his mind angrily. He 
tried to decide if he wanted to 
watch or not. He did. 

He watched in horrible fascina- 
tion as Bill rose and walked over 
to Cynthe. He dropped to a squat- 
ting position again, in front of her. 
He held the bayonet toward her. 
Its whitish point was less than a foot 
from her. She stared at it. Tony 
waited, forgetting to breathe. 

Then she tilted her head back 
and swallowed the rest of the mis- 
erable coffee with a shudder. She 
set the cup down and ignored the 
bayonet, looking instead into Bill’s 
eyes. “Has it occurred to you that 
if an Android can control, con- 
sciously, its body, it — I — might de- 
cide not to heal right up? Surely 
control works both ways.” 

“Hey, Bill, that’s right!” Tony’s 
voice was loud. “It wouldn’t prove 
a thing.” 

Bill shook his head. “Now you got 
me wondering about you again. 
Missy. You had me convinced. But 
now you’re trying to get out of it. 
Yeah, what you say’s possible. But 
m^ybe not if an A didn’t know it 
was an A. Not if you were hypno- 
tized, like I said.” 

She looked at the blade, raising 
her eyebrows and wrinkling her 
nose. “That’s a good point,” she 



said quietly. “But I wonder why if 
there was more than one Android 
left they’d bother. They’d be more 
than a match for you. Even one 
might be.” She poked a finger daint- 
ily into her mouth and extended it. 
With the same delicacy she tapped 
the bayonet’s tip. 

There was a tiny hissing spat of 
steam. She jerked her hand back. 
She looked at Bill again. 

“There’s something else. Androids 
and humans have supposedly never 
mated because Androids have the 
control you mentioned. No mother 
Android would want to bring a 
half-Man into the world to suf- 
fer.” 

“You’re talking like one. Lady.” 
Bill’s voice was low and ominous. 

“Um. Android males have al- 
ways held an attraction for human 
females . but that same mech- 
anism prevented Androids from 
taking advantage. No rapes, no vol- 
untary seduction. And we all know 
some women tried. But as far as 
we know there’s never been a cross- 
ing of the line in that regard.” She 
studied Bill’s face, then looked up 
at Tony. “Tell me, Tony Baker and 
Bill Jackson, which of you would 
have that much regard for your 
offspring?” 

“Now, dammit — ” Bill began. 

Tony’s eyes widened. He started 
forward. “Don’t!” 

B ut he was too late; very deliber- 
ately Cynthe drew back her left 
hand and shoved it forward to im- 
pale Its upraised thumb on the point 
of the bayonet. There was a hiss 
and the sudden odor of roasting

IF 




flesh and a bitten-off, childish whim- 
per. 

“My God,” Tony managed to get 
out, despite his heaving stomach. In- 
voluntarily Bill jerked the gun. The 
bayonet slipped free. Her eyes clos- 
ed, her face contorted in pain, her 
teeth fastened in her lower lip, 
Cynthe clapped her left hand to her 
breast and covered it with her right. 

“It — hurts,” she said, in a tiny, 
surprised voice. 

“Why’re you hiding it?” Bill 
asked. He stood quickly. His eyes 
were bright and glassy, resembling 
cat-eye marbles. 

“She’s not hiding it, stupid,” Tony 
flared at him. “She’s nursing it!” 

Cynthe looked at Bill sadly, her 
green eyes remaining ingenuously 
wide. Slowly she dropped her right 
hand, unclenched the left, and held 
a gashed, blackened thumb up to- 
ward Bill. Without changing her 
thumbs-up gesture she rose to her 
feet. “Would you like to put your 
finger into it, Thomas?” He did not 
answer. Tony stood, rooted, then 
began to unbutton his shirt. He 
pulled it off and went to her, wrap- 
ped it around her injured hand and 
tied the sleeves together at the wrist. 
She didn’t look at him. 

“Proof?” she asked, in the same 
tiny voice, but her shrug was im- 
plicit in it. My God, Tony thought, 
she’s brave. “It will take several 
days even to begin to heal,” Cynthe 
said. “During that time I want — ” 
her voice paled, as her lips did — “I 
want to live apart from you.” 

“You will, Cynthe,” Tony told 
her. “You can stay in the plane. 
There’s two good bunks Bill and 



I rigged from the seats. But then — ” 
“I’ll be ready,” she said. “Mean- 
while, lock me in.” 

Bill lowered the bayonet, staring 
at her, as she stepped between them 
and walked to the Scouter. As she 
reached it she turned. “If I know 
I'm an Android, I could control 
this. Maybe I am controlling it now. 
If I’m an Android, but have been 
hypnotized so that I don’t know it 
— ” She smiled. “Then perhaps I 
have a posthypnotic suggestion that 
prevents my wounds from healing 
rapidly?” She shook her head, still 
smiling. “Be sure to lock me in.” 
She climbed into the broken cab- 
in of the aircraft

T ony and Bill looked at each 
other. 

Tony watched the other man load 
his arms with wood and bring it 
over to the campfire in the moon- 
light. “Help you. Bill?” 

“Naw.” 

Tony frowned. He regarded his 
toes. He picked up the bayonet and 
a piece of wood and whittled at it. 
“Bill?” 

“Yeah?” Bill sat on the other log, 
facing him. He picked up the rifle 
and looked at it, set it down again. 
“We’re lucky. About Cynthe.” 
“Yeah. If she’s not an Android.” 
“Even if she is. Bill.” Tony whit- 
tled, not looking up from the piece 
of wood he was denuding. Its bare 
whiteness gleamed like flesh. 

Bill looked at him. “What do you 
mean?” 

“I mean that last thing she said.

She’s right. We can never be sure 
about her. But even if she is an A, 
what difference does it make?” Tony 
lied deliberately; he had thought of 
a way to be sure. If the girl were 
knocked out, as he’d been, thea cut 
— but he had decided not to tell 
Bill. He didn’t want her tested. 

Bill’s voice was sarcastic. “I don’t 
know, Tony. If there’s a snake over 
there in your sleeping bag, what’s 
the difference whether it’s a black 
snake or a timber rattler?” 

“Here,” Bill said, and he handed 
the younger man a small leather pic- 
ture case. Tony looked at him, then 
opened thi case; a woman and a 
man smiled at him. He nodded, 
looked his question at Bill. 

“That’s the difference, Tony. My 
Mom. I’m uh . virgin, Tony. 
Yeah, Big Bill, I admit it. I’ve never 
touched anybody. You want to hear 
how she died, my Mom?” 

Think about that later, Tony 
thought. “No. But, Bill—” 

“Tliat tell you why I’ll never 
make peace? \\^y I’ll kill the last 
damned Android if I can? Or why 
I’ll kill you, if I have to, to keep 
you from filthying yourself?” 
“What’d you do after she died. 
Bill?” 

“I took this gun — ” he picked 
it up — “and that bayonet and I 
went wild. I won two medals. I 
kept on .going wild till I was as- 
signed to this work detail. By then 
th^y weren’t passing out medals any 
more. I didn’t want ’em anyhow.” 
“Bill, have you ever thought . 
don’t you tfai^ you’re a little un- 
realistic? Now, I mean, with every- 
one gone? Why keep on hating?” 



B ill hefted the picture case with- 
out looking into it. His eyes 
narrowed and his hand squeezed 
hard, whitening his fingernails. “Be- 
cause there’s one left.” 

“Maybe,” Tony reminded him, 
and Bill shrugged. 

“Maybe, yeah.” 

“You’ll find a reason to kill her 
anyhow, won’t you?” 

“Just what the hell are you say- 
ing?” Bill eyes were bright as he 
restored the picture to his left shirt 
pocket, carefully rebuttoning the 
flap. 

“Just that maybe you cracked a 
little bit the day your mother was 
killed.” 

“Calling me insane, that what 
you’re doing? You damned fool!” 
Bill shot to his feet. “See what that 
damned girl — that damrted thing, I 
mean — is doing to us? Already 
she’s standing between us! Girl or 
thing, she — she has the body of 
a harlot!” 

“That’s what I thought. Bill. It 
doesn’t make any difference to you 
whether she’s a girl or an A.” 

“Damn you! You don’t believe 
that! You think it doesn’t make any 
difference to you. You’re thinking 
with your crotch, not your head. 
You think that as long as she looks 
round and soft and big-bosomed 
that’s all — ” 

“You don’t like women very well, 
do you, Bill?” 

Bill stared. Whatever he said was 
a growl in his throat as he leaped. 
Tony went backward off the log 
with the big man on him and felt 
him stiffen and saw the moonlight 
wink off the point of the bayonet

as it slipped out of Bill’s back. 
Tony’s wrist hurt; it was twisted 
against his body. 

“T-Tony — ” 

“Bill! Oh my God, Bill! I’m so 
sorry — Bill!” The big man was 
limp against him. Slowly, shaking his 
head and blinking to clear away 
tears, Tony got out from under 
him. He stared down at Bill Jack- 
son’s form, unmoving. Suddenly the 
thought came to him: Yes. I’ve got- 
ten out from under him. 

S&mewhere, somewhen, there was 
exultation. 

Tony Baker sobbed, an ugly dry 
sound, and then he turned and ran 
to the plane. He wasn’t sure if Bill 
were alive or dead. Maybe the two 
of them, Tony and Cynthe, could fix 
him up, nurse him, take care of 
him. Then Bill would know — 

As his hand touched the metallic 
blue door of the S-195 something 
extremely hard and solid struck him 
in the back. 

He heard a loud crackling sound 
as he arched his back, falling against 
the plane, struggling to turn, to 
stay on his feet. 

“My God, Bill — ” He slid down 
the smooth side of the Scouter and 
sat against it, his head on his chest. 

“Didn’t know I had bullets in 
my podcet, did you. Sport?” Bill said 
to the dead man as he stumbled 
across the clearing. With all his 
strength he got to the plane, perked 
the hot thing out of his abdomen, 
felt it bring the blood rushing with 
it. He got the door open. The girl 
was there, her thumb still band- 
aged, her eyes wide and green and 
young. 



“What was that? Was that a 
shot?” 

He lunged forward into the cab- 
in, bayonet held before him. He 
felt its momentary halt as it struck 
her stomach, then felt it slide in. 
heard her cry, heard her moans as 
he lay half within, half out of the 
little craft. 

He was dead before the lonely 
sun rose.

T he bigger one carried a small 
case. It swung from her shoul- 
der on a long leather strap, bump- 
ing her big hip. She carried some- 
thing in her other hand; a club, 
made from the leg of a table. The 
smaller one was empty-handed, full- 
breasted. They came out of the for- 
est and walked to the edge of a 
downsloping bank, the flood-channel 
of a stream that was now merely a 
trickle. 

The bigger one stopped her com- 
panion with an arm. They stopped 
and looked across the stream at the 
clearing, the fire, the wreckage of 
a small S-203 scout aircraft, and the 
two men. 

The smaller man wore a bandage 
about his head. For a moment the 
two women watched them, watched 
their strong bodies raise a bracing 
pole against a half-completed leanto 
at the east side of the clearing. Then 
the big woman kicked a small rock 
with the toe of her boot and watched 
it rattle down the bank. It bounced, 
then bounced again, leaping into the 
air to splash into the gurgling water. 
The big man turned toward them.

His arm swept up, pointed. He ran 
to the campfire and picked up a 
heavy rifle with a silvery knife at 
its end. 

“Wait, Bill,” Tony Baker said. 
“Wait — they’re women.” 

*'Maybe they’re women,” Bill 
Jackson said. “Don’t be too silre. 
You know about Androids. They 
can change themselves.” 

“Boy, she’s a big one! Your size. 
Bill. Me for the little blonde.” Tony 
Baker waved. “Hi!” He winced and 
dropped the hand to his head. 
“Danm! I’ve still got a headache.” 
“That’s good, Tony. I don’t mean 
the headache — I mean talk. Talk 
to them. Blit be careful.” 

T he two men walked across the 
clearing. They stopped on their 
side of the bank, gazing across at 
the two women. The big redhead 
was maybe thirty, maybe a little 
less. She was one hell of a hunk of 
woman, Tony thought. About twice 
as much as he’d care to try to han- 
dle. Her companion — he smiled. 
Small, rather babyfaced, with long 
pale hair and big wide eyes that 
looked green from where he stood. 
And she was either built or she 
was carrying a very large con- 
cealed , weapon in what was left of 
the blouse tied over her breasts. 

“Stop right there,” the redhead 
said, and she hefted the table-leg. 
“Don’t come any nearer.” 

“Uh — but — who’s coming?” 
Tony said uncomfortably. “This is 
our camp. You came.” Boy, what a 
way to begin a conversation! What 
a wav to introduce myself! “We’re 
just standing here, ma’m.” 



“Let’s keep it that way. We don’t 
dare take any chances. You two 
male himks could be Androids . 
although I gotta admit I hope you’re 
not.” 

Bill Jackson exploded angry words 
*'We could be Androids!” 

“Ah, so you’re not mute after all, 
huh, bigun?” The redhead smiled 
and waggled the club, “Of course 
you could be. How are we to know, 
two defenseless women?” 

She looks about as defenseless, 
Tony diought, as Bill Jackson. She 
was nearly six feet tall if she was 
an inch, with flashing eyes and a 
beat-up officer’s cap riding jauntily 
on a mane of pure flame. She wore 
a loose combat jacket, big chest poc- 
kets with their flaps and brass but- 
tons making it impossible for him 
to know if she had anything under- 
neath or not. A wide black belt 
with a shiny U.S. buckle cinched her 
waist, tightly, above long, long legs 
encased in shiny black military jodh- 
purs and knee-high boots. Something 
or other in an odd little case hung 
from a shoulder strap. Oh, she’s 
female, he thought, but no defense- 
less female! She wore the armored 
officer’s uniform and gave orders as 
if she’d been used to both all her 
life. But the other one . 

“By damn!” Bill Jackson said, 
and Tony looked at him as the big 
man blinked. “By golly!** 

“As a matter of fact we couldn’t 
trust you boys even if you aren’t 
Androids. Wars turn some people 
into into beasts!” She hooked her 
left thumb into the wide belt and 
hefted the tableleg again. “So you 
two just stand there. Who are you?”

''TNmy grinned. Give him a com- 
A mand-tone and he sure snaps 
to, he thought. He hardly knew the 
big man, but Bill had b^n playing 
Big Man ever since he’d pulled Tony 
out of his cracked-up S-203 and 
patched him up. Tony had allowed 
it. He was twenty-three and a cap- 
tain, a pilot. But what the hell can 
you do when you’re all stringy mus- 
cle and shorter and younger? 

“All right small type, what’s your 
problem?” 

“You make big noises for a de- 
fenseless woman,” he told her. “I’m 
Tony Baker, I’m a Texican, and my 
mother wasn’t an Android. And I 
bleed, and scab, and scar. Okay?” 
The redhead shook her head. 
“Nokay. But turnabout’s fair, I 
guess. I’m Lilith. Call me Lily. And 
I’m not from Texas, so how come 
I’m bigger’n you?” 

Bill Jackson whooped and slapped 
his new friend on the back so hard 
Tony was barely able to keep from 
going over the embankment, 

“This little one with the big 
front’s Cynthe James. At least that’s 
her s^ory. Sounds like a madeup 
name to me, and she was showbiz. 
She’s lost her memory, poor thing, 
since she got a dose of some kind of 
gas and woke up surrounded by 
corpses. Me, I’ve got memories too, 
but I’m stuck with ’em. Oh, and I 
outrank you. Mister. I’m afraid I 
made captain over a year ago.” She 
tossed Bill a smart-aleck salute. 
“Serial number, bigun, fast.” 



“Eigjit - nine - oh - one - twe • 
five - five - nine - six Gee Oee." 
“Lovely. Vm impressed* Baker?” 
“You may not like this, lady: Ay -

one, T for Texas.” 

“AO! My my. That miserable 
piece of tin over there your 
plane?” 

“It was. And I’m afraid I made 
captain two years ago.” 

Again she flij^ed the mock-salute 
from the bill of a cap with a sev- 
eral-thousand-mission crush. “Now 
fellas, here’s the pitch. There’s just 
one way I know to tell an A from 
a human, and that’s by woimding the 
suspect. Now I see you have a 
nice shiny bayonet . ” 

Bill nodd^ exuberantly, and 
Tony saw that his eyes were bright 
and shining as a boy’s. He raised 
the bayoneted rifle. 

“Y’know,” Lily said, “I believe 
you might not be an Android after 
all, bigun. You’re too damn dumb. 
Stop that! Any A’d have sense 
enough to heat that oversize pocket- 
knife before he started carving him- 
self. Go on over to the fire and 
heat it. We’ll follow. At a dis- 
tance.”

/Grinning sheeplishly, Bill nodded 
or and backed away. Then, near- 
ly stumbling, he turned and walked 
to the fire. He looked back over 
his shoulder twice. 

Tony stared. Who was this guy? 
What had happened to that Bill 
Jackson fella? Bill squatted by the 
fire and began to heat the blade

while Tony stood beside him, watch- 
ing the long-legged approach of Lily 
and the hip-swing walk of her 
friend Cynthe. Funny name, Cyn- 
the. It seemed vaguely, elusively fa- 
miliar. 

Bill held up the bayonet. In the 
wan light of the setting sun it 
glowed pink. “Enough?” 

Lily nodded, thumb hooked in 
belt, stick-club ready, and watched 
as Bill detached the bayonet from 
the rifle and held out his left arm. 

“Let’s go first class, Sergeant,” 
Lily said, “And make it a nice deep 
one.” Bill nodded, grinning. He 
slashed his forearm. Then he held 
it out for inspection. It trickled red. 

“Didn’t hurt,” he said, the way 
a ten-year-old would have proclaim- 
ed it. He held the barely glowing 
bayonet out to Tony. He took it 
gingerly, then looked at Cynthe. 
“Can’t you talk, Cyndie?” 

“When I have a chance,” she said, 
with a smile that reminded him of a 
shaft of sunlight bursting through 
clouds after a rain. Lily chuckled. 
Tony glanced at her and the tall 
woman nodded meaningfully at the 
bayonet. 

“By your leave, Captain,” he said. 
“Proceed, Captain,” she said. 
“Ouch! Bill’s a damned liar — 
it does hurt!” He waved the bleed- 
ing arm in the air. He hung on to 
the bayonet. “How about your using 
it now. Captain?” 

“Don’t be silly. Sport,” Bill said, 
and Tony was startled to see that 
the man was angry. 

“Glad to,” Lily said. “Want to 
trust me with that bayonet?” 

Tony considered. “Not bloody 



likely,” he said. He waved it in the 
air, cooling it before returning it 
to his boot. 

“Well, we’re bleeding,” Bill said, 
practically bouncing up and down. 
If the big idiot had a tail, Tony 
thought, he’d wag it. “Now what?” 
“Stop slavering. Big Man. Now 
we separate, but we get together 
once a day to see how those 
wounds’re healing. After we’re sure 
we can trust one another ...” 
“Then we can love,” Cynthe said 
in a guileless little voice, and Bill 
and Tony blinked. Bill’s eyes nar- 
rowed as he looked at the unaffected 
child-face. 

L ily laughed. “Cynthe! Tsk!” 
Then, rather apologetically, she 
told the men: “She’s a bit off in 
that area. Amnesia, as I said, but 
from what I gather she was a few 
days from marriage. She’s nuts about 
kids.” Lily patted her shoulder. 
“She’ll come out of it.” 

“Sure she will. You’ll be fine, 
Cynthe,” Tony said. “You’ll be just 
fine.” 

“I told her I’d do all the talking,” 
Lily said. “It wasn’t easy to get it 
through this fluffhead’s koko that — 
well, we may be the last human 
beings, peer — ee — odd.” She re- 
garded them in silence as the im- 
pact of it went pounding on heavy 
feet through their minds. “Your 
trust is touching, boys, but not 
smart. Our turn.” The big woman 
flipped the chairleg club into her 
left hand and unbuttoned two but- 
tons of her blouse with her right. 
Bill gawked. Tony marveled at 
Lilith’s lack of reserve, her unaf- 



42 



IF 




fected candor. She seemed as ultra- 
civilized as Cynthe did ingenuous. 
It was almost as if Lilith were from 
somewhere far away. 

“Easy, bigun,” she said, grinning 
a widemouthed grin at Bill. “Some- 
times us big-types aren’t big every- 
where. I’m afraid there’s not much 
in here but — this.” Her hand came 
out of the uniform blouse with a 
knife and automatically Tony’s knees 
bent in a half-crouch as his hand 
whipped up from his boot with the 
bayonet. ^ 

Twenty feet away Lilith blinked. 
“Touchy cuss, aren’t you? By your 
leave, Capn,” she said, imitating his 
own ironic tone, and she swung and 
nicked Cynthe’s arm with her little 
knife. 

“Oh!” 

“Bleed for your life, kid,” Lily 
said, and she pushed Cynthe away 
and quickly slashed her own arm. 
More red drops fell to stain the 
ground. “Now, We meet here daily 
for arm-inspection, right? Come on, 
Cyn.” 

Cynthe hung back, her full lower 
lip puckering. “Oh, can’t we stay 
and have something hot?” 

Lily slung back her vermillion 
mane and guffawed, “Like Bill and 
Tony, maybe?” And she laughed 
some more. “She has a passion for 
coffee.” She shrugged. “Little hard 
to find in the middle of the Oregon 
woods, Cynthe-babe.” 

“We’ve got coffee,” Tony said, 
aware that he spoke too rapidly, too 
eagerly. He tried to slow his words, 
to sound casual. “Fresh acorn cof- 
fee.” 

“Eyuk,” Lily commented with 



feeling. “You ain’t sellin’ me, Tony 
Baker. We’ll see you.” 

“Uh — Cap’n Lily,” Bill said. He 
raised a hand. “We — uh — we have 
twelve cigarettes. Maybe we should 
all have a smoke before we break 
up.” 

“Peace pipe? Us good girls don’t 
smoke. Sorry.” 

“In that cracked-up Scouter,” 
Tony said, “there are. two bunks. 
Bill and I fixed ’em up out of 
the seats this morning. You might 
as well spend the night in there. The 
hatch secures from inside.” 

S he hooked a thumb into her belt 
again, threw out her left hip 
and her right leg. She poked at her 
lip with the club, obviously con- 
sidering. No one spoke for perhaps 
a minute; a long minute. “You 
know, Tony Baker Captain comma 
USAF, I retract about — oh, fifty 
per cent of what I’ve said and 
thought about you. Cynthe honey, 
trot over there and get in the plane, 
will you? And lock the door.” 
Cynthe trotted. Tony watched the 
delightful process happily, while 
Lily watched him and Bill watched 
Lily. When the door slammed be- 
hind the blonde girl Lily ambled 
after her, keeping an eye on the 
men. She tried the door-handle, then 
yanked, twisted. 

“Okay. It’s locked, all ri^t. Cyn- 
the, open up for mama. Tony, Bill 
— ” she bowed, man-fashion — “we 
thank you for your hospitality. See 
you in the AM. Have fun.” And in 
she climbed, longjeggedly. The door 
slammed. 

“Boy,” Bill said, the word riding 



AAANDROID 



43 




exuberantly out on a great breath 
of air. “Boy. That’s some female 
woman.” 

Tony grinned at the Cajun talk, 
then said with great innocence: 
“Not an A?” 

“Ah, don’t be silly. They’re the 
ones worried — about us!” Bill 
chuckled. “Man, she’s some tough! 
Did you see her, Tony? Did you 
see her?” 

“No,” Tony said, hanging the 
kettle over the campfire and plac- 
ing two logs. “No, I didn’t. I saw 
nothing, I was struck blind by Cyn- 
the.” 

**Cynthe,'* Bill said, the way a 
drinking man says milk. He shook 
his head. “Cynthe! Huh! I bet that 
big bazooka packs a wallop like 
a grizzly. Tony . you know who 
she . reminds me of? It’s amaz- 
ing. Even the name.” 

Tony looked around, interested. 
Bill’s voice had a faraway quali- 
ty. “No, BiU. Who?” 

Bill was staring at the aircraft. 
“My mother. Big woman. Tough. 
Twice the guts my dad ever had. 
And her name was Lillian. Oh, not 
the same . Mom’s hair wasn’t 
even red. Now I know it should 
have been, though, after seeing 
Capn Lil.” He wagged his head 
again. 

Staring at him, narrow-eyed, Tony 
shook his head. “Yeah,” he said. 
“Yeah. I see.” 

He gave his physical attention to 
the' pot of acorn coffee. Bill stood 
still, gazing at the twisted silvery 
scoutcraft in the manner of a coon- 
hound waiting for his man to come 
with light and rifle. 



XIII 

T ony was sitting, his eyes some- 
where in the fire, thinking as 
he sipped his second cup of mis- 
erable coffee, when Bill poured a 
cup. “Hey, Bill, you’ve had two. 
Those worms’ll give you a fever or 
the runs or something.” 

“Not for me,” Bill said, with a 
grin Tony could only call sly. The 
big man turned and headed for the 
plane. 

“Hey!” Tony’s voice rebounded 
from the other man’s back with no 
visible effect. Tony shook his head, 
grinning, the grin slowly changing 
to a frown. “Oh well,” he told him- 
self. “To each, as the man said, his 
own.” But he continued to watch, 
hoping to catch a glimpse of Cynthe, 
poor kid, when — if — the hatch 
opened. 

It did, and he saw a flash of 
steel; Lily’s knife. Without hearing 
what they said he saw Bill offer her 
the cup, saw him sip it and proffer it 
again, saw Lily take it, sling its con- 
tents disdainfully on the ground. 
What she needs, Tony thought, is 
somebody about Bill’s size . but 
somebody who liked his daddy bet- 
ter than his mommy! 

“What’s up, bigun?” Lily asked 
Bill, and she waved the knife in 
his face. She looked down at hhn 
from the arch of the S-203’s hatch- 
way. 

“Miss . Li . Capn . uh — 
I thought maybe you’d like a cup 
of coffee?” 

“Coffee? Acorn stew? There 
shouldn’t even be any of those 
around here. What’s the worm

count?” She stuck a thumb in her 
belt the way Bill’s mom used to 
hook one workworn thumb in the 
front of her apron. She jerked the 
knife at the cup. “Or for that mat- 
ter the poison count, Mister And- 
roid? Suppose you try it.” 

Bill did, taking a healthy swig of 
the murky stuff and letting her see 
him swallow. He held the cup out 
to her once more, hoping that she 
would accept it. 

“You think I’m gonna drink that 
stuff after you’ve slobbered in it? 
Not, in the immortal words of Cap- 
tain ‘Texican’ Baker, bloody like- 
ly!” And she took the cup and 
swung her arm in an arc, sending 
the dark liquid splattering to the 
ground. She stared at him. “You 
look as if you’re about to cry, Billy 
Jackson.” 

His eyes widened. “I — I haven’t 
been called Billy since . since 
Mom ...” 

“Afom.'” She exploded the word 
from her mouth as if it were un- 
clean. “Mom! Boy, thafs not like- 
ly! I wouldn’t even want you for an 
ancestor, much less a son.” 

He looked down. “You’re a 
tough woman to please, Capn. You 
make me want to say I’m sorry 
everytime I open my mouth.” 

Her hand touched his shoulder, 
his cheek. “Moon-calf,” she said. 
“Poor, twisted-up moon-calf. Look, 
Bill Jackson, suppose you go back 
to the fire. Sit around for awhile. 
Then take a little walk. Across the 
creek, or whatever you call the 
gash in the ground over there. 
That big fir tree with the light- 
ning-blast. Okay?” 



H e stared at her, then nodded. 

She withdrew her hand, un- 
polished nail slicing his cheek, 
grinned, and pulled the cabin door 
closed. He heard her dog it. He 
went back to the fire, walking, Tony 
calculated, about two feet above 
the ground. 

“Boy, she’s an unfriendly one,” 
Tony said over his cup. But his 
eyes were narrowing*, waiting for 
the reaction he expected. 

Bill’s head snapped up. “No she 
isn’t! It’s natural. She thinks we 
may be Androids, that’s all. Hell, 
Tony, she’s a woman. You know 
how some men are about women. 
Gotta be careful.” 

“Yeah, Yeah. She ought to trim 
her nails, too.” Tony watched Bill 
raise a guilty hand to his cheek. 
“It migjit’va helped. Bill, if you’d 
acted like that bayonet-cut hurt. You 
tried to impress ’em and gave a 
damned good imitation of an And- 
roid.” 

“My gosh! I didn’t think ef that!” 
Bill stared at him. “Boy, I guess you 
were right. That goshawfill coffee 
— whew! I think I’ll take a walk.” 
He stood with a great show of be- 
ing casual, looked around as if 
trying to decide which way to go. 
He nodded and started toward the 
stream. 

“Bill.” 

Jackson stopped, looked around. 
Tony waved the bayonet. “Better 
take this.” 

Bill hesistated, then bobbed his 
head and came back for it. “Yeah. 
Make a loud noise if anything hap- 
pens, Sport.” 

“You too. Bill,” Tony said, and

he turned back to watch the orange 
and yellow and blue dance of the 
flames. 

He heard Bdl’s boots — clump, 
squish — as he jumped the stream. 
We ought to bridge that silly thing, 
Tony thought. From the tail of his 
eye he watched the Scouter’s door 
ease open, saw the big woman look- 
ing at him, then sliding out. She 
closed the door quickly and silently 
and leaned against it a moment, 
watching him. Then she stepped 
into the woods. 

Tony Baker sighed. He regarded 
the bubbling pot. Maybe / should 
try the coffee gambit, he thought. 
But what if she is .. Synthetic 
Cyntbe? What if she is? 

He thought about it. 

4 4/^ver here, Billy. Watch that 
^^big root — I nearly fell flat. 
Sit down here, against the tree.” 
Without a word Bill sat, looking 
up at her. He liked looking up at 
her. The shiny kneeboots moved to 
within a couple of feet of him. 
“You — you’re some woman.” 

“Or some Android?” 

“Hell, you’re no A!” 

“You sure? ” 

“I’m sure.” 

“As a matter of fact you’re 
right. But you and that Tony. Him 
a captain? How old is he?” 

He shnigged. “Possible. Told me 
he got into it when he was sev- 
enteen. Air Force; can’t fly un- 
less you’re an officer. Or he may’ve 
been trying to impress you girls — 
but he’s at least a first lieutenant, 
anyhow. You really worried about 
us, still? You hate A s that much?” 



“Well, you’ve no idea. No idea. 
Bill Jackson, how much an Android 
has cost me.” 

“Your family?” 

She smiled in the darkness, study- 
ing the tree against which he sat. 
“Yes. Yes, my family. The very 
closest member.” 

“Me, too,” he said, and he fished 
the picture case out of his pocket. 
“Here.” 

She shook her head. “No thanks. 
I burned mine, Billy Jackson. You 
should, too.” 

“Yeah, maybe . maybe now, I 
can.” His forehead rippled. 

“Now, Bill. Suppose I told you 
I am an Android.” 

He gazed up at her, slipping the 
case slowly back into his left shirt 
pocket. He studied her; the boots 
and the flaring jodhpurs, the big 
hips and hands, the odd little case 
swinging from her shoulder, the 
belt buckle, bright even , in the 
shadowed darkness under the trees. 
“Nope. I couldn’t believe you. Cap- 
tain.” He shook his head positive- 
ly. “Nope.” 

“Um. Suppose I told you Cynthe 
was. That her name’s short for 
‘synthetic’?” 

He jerked his back away from 
the tree, sitting erect. His voice was 
a low susurration. “Is she? I won- 
dered . what she said, so funny 
. damn! Is she?” 

Lilith shrugged, holding his eyes 
with hers. “She’s with me. Would it 
matter?” 

“Funny thing to say.” His answ-r 
came without hesitation. “Of enur^ - 
it matters! She’d have to die An 
A’s an A.” 



46 



IF 




“Brilliant,” she muttered. “That’d 
be his business, wouldn’t it? 
Tony’s?” 

He shook his dark head. “No, 
Ma’m! It’s my business. I’m a 
man. A Man.” 

“Period, huh? Is that it. Bill?” 

He nodded. “Period. ISie’s an A, 
she dies.” 

“Men,” she said. “Men. You’re 
sure I’m not — but you’re ready to 
believe that little thing is. Ready to 
kill her. You believe what you want 
to believe, don’t you?” 

CCTt’s not too bad,” Cynthe said. 

X“It makes pretty good coffee. 
Thank you, Tony.” She smiled daz- 
zlingly at him over the cup. “She 
told me to stay in the plane. I 
would’ve too, if you hadn’t come 
and asked me to have some coffee. 
I — I hoped you would,” she chuc- 
kled, smiling into the cup in the 
manner of a child inspecting a 
Christmas package. ''Acorn coffee!” 
She drank, peered again into the 
cup, then set it down. 

He sat with his eyes on her, 
trying to think of something he 
could say that would make her smile 
again. He was startled as very wide, 
intensely green eyes turned on him. 

“Something odd,” she told him. 
“You know, I discovered I can . 
I can make this wound heal right 
up!” She held out her arm. “With- 
out a scar or anything. Lily got mad 
and made me cut myself again.” Her 
big eyes looked into his. “Does that 
mean I’m — ” 

“Stop!” His voice was intense. “I 
— I knew it, I think. I’ve been 
thinking about it Cynthe. It doesn’t 



matter.” His hand reached out and 
took hers gently. “Not to me. But it 
would to Bill. That’s why you’ve 
got to promise not to mention it 
any more. Not ever.” 

Her huge eyes flickered emerald 
in the firelight. “I promise.” 

“What should we do, Cynthe? 
What do you want?” 

Her shoulder lifted in an unaf- 
fected shrug. “Babies,” she an- 
swered at once. “Oh childrenl 
Y-your children ...” When she 
dropped her eyes it was not coquerty. 
She was the most artlessly genuine 
person he had ever met Her eyes 
came back up to his, and he nodded. 

“Uh-huh. The eternal nest-builder. 
The eternal optimist. A man wants 
it for one reason, a woman for 
another, human or Android. For 
what, Cynthe?” His voice remained 
intense, and he was unaware of the 
pressure he was exerting on her 
hand, unaware of the faint change 
that took place in it. Flesh and 
muscle hardened as, a nearly auto- 
matic defense against pain. “For 
what, Cynthe? What if there’s no 
future?” 

A little vertical channel opened 
between her eyes as the inside 
edges of her brows lifted. “Isn’t 
that the only way there can be a 
future? If we make one? That’s 
what she said.” 

“Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is. I 
think a man gives less of a damn 
about the human race than a wom- 
an; we want a kid of two to ex- 
tend our own pride. But . ^ it 
would be nice to bounce a grand- 
son someday. Who will our son

marry, Synthetic Cynthe, if we can 
have one? Or our daughter?” 

“But didn’t Adam and his wife, 
created, like me, from him ...” 

He interrupted. “His second wife. 
Yes, PoUyana. But who did Adam’s 
son marry?” 

She narrowed those round eyes, 
pursed her lips, puckered an un- 
marked brow. He realized it might 
be unmarked ten, twenty years from 
now. No. He’d ask her to age — a 
little — as he did. He didn’t think 
he ooidd stand it otherwise. 

“ ‘And Cain left the presence of 
the Lord,* ” she said, looking up, 
“ ‘ and settled in the land of Nod, 
East of Eden. Cain knew his wife, 
and she conceived and — ” 

“His wife, Cynthe. His wife. What 
wife? There were people over in 
Nod, then, right? But this is Nod. 
There is no Eden, and I think that 
part of the old story makes its 
figurative sense clear. There were 
others. But for us, for our Cain, 
or Abei, or little Cynthe — ” 

“For us,” she said very softly, 
“for us, Tony, there is no land of 
Nod. But if our first child is a girl, 
or if tiiere are never any boys, 
well.” The serious expression was 
incongruous on her ingenuous face, 
but it was there, and her eyes were 
purpeseM. “There is the story of 
Lot, Tony, in the same book. His 
wife was gone, and his daughters 
wanted chfldren. So they had chil- 
dren by their father. They each 
bore him a son, Moab and . 
somebody. Or — if we have only 
sons ... oh, Tony!” Her other hand 
came up to cover his, small and 
warm. “Don’t look at me that way. 



We’re overcoming a bigger barrier 
right now than that one, breaking 
a stronger code. Men lay their 
aversion to what they call ‘Incest’ 
to the Bible, the Torah . but the 
book itself sets the precedent, fig- 
urative or not.” 

She waited for him to say some- 
thing. He did not. 

“And don’t cite me the Bourbons 
of France,” she said, reminding him 
of the high intelligence, the high 
Android reasoning power behind 
that open face. “We’re not the 
Bourbons. My kind can’t be mental- 
ly ill. And you must be immune 
to practically everything, or you 
wouldn’t be here. Not even color- 
blind, or you wouldn’t have been 
in the Air Force!” She smiled, a 
simple* upeurving of the corners 
of her pink mouth. Her fingers 
tightened on his. “And we’ll have 
many children, anyhow. Won’t we?” 

He nodded raising his other hand 
to her face — And the screaming 
began. 

XIV 

S orrowfully the tall woman looked 
down at the big man sprawled, 
like an overgrown boy, beneath the 
tree. “There’s just no hope, is there. 
Bill? No chance. You’re immunt- 
able.” 

“Huh?”, 

“You have any idea what’s in 
here?” She tapped the shiny case 
at her hip. 

“No. Funny-looking affair. Food, 
I guess. What’s it made of, any- 
how?” 

“Oh. it’s a synthetic. It’s called 



48 



IF 




Timeless. Yes, I guess it is food. 
Nourishment for Mankind. Some- 
thing for you, Billy Jackson.” She 
sank to her haunches beside him 
and slid the strap off her shoul- 
ders. She set the case on his thighs. 
He looked at it and at her with 
a questioning frown. 

“What’s the biggest rule you can 
think of. One you wouldn’t dream 
of breaking, Bill?” 

“What? Gosh, I don’t know. The 
biggest rule. Like rape, or — oh. 
Sure, I know. Androids.'* His lips 
stiffened. 

She sighed. “Intermingling with 
the Androids. Yes, that’s yom* code. 
Bill, if you can believe this: I’m 
breaking an even bigger injunction 
by doing this. But I’ve got to. For 
you. For Man.” 

Nervously he tried to smile. 
“Lord, what’s in here?” 

She looked at him. “You really 
want to know?” Her voice was 
teasing. He nodded, and now he 
grinned. She gazed at him still. 
Then she came to her decision. 
“You sure do spoil a surprise, Billy 
Jackson. It’s a timber rattler.” 

He chuckled. “In this little case? 
And this far North?” He bent his 
head, laughing, and flipped up the 
catch. He lifted the lid. 

The timber rattler lurched for- 
ward and struck him in the left side 
of his shirt, just below the pocket 
with its picture-case. It clung, fangs 
caught for a moment in the fabric. 

In' that moment Lilith’s knife 
swished out, chopped, in one swift 
stroke, down into the back of the 
snake’s head. It lashed violently 
and opened its jaws and died. 



“My God!” Bill Jackson choked. 
“It — it was I What — you — I’ve 
got to get to the camp! There’s a 
kit in the plane — oh! it hurts!” 

“It got you near the heart, Billy. 
I imagine it’s too late. And ... I 
told you, Man. I warned you, gave 
you a chance. But . just in case 
it’s not too late — ” 

He was struggling to rise, clutch- 
ing his chest, reaching down to 
his boot for the bayonet, confused, 
bewildered, gasping. He looked at 
her, saw the fist coming, said 
“Mom — ” 

And the fist slammed into his 
jaw and he slid sideways to the 
ground and lay unconscious, his 
eyes closed peacefully. 

S he pinned the dead snake’s head 
to the ground and squatted there, 
watching him, watching has chest. 
At least he was not feeling the 
burning pain, the swelling, the slow- 
ing of his heart . 

Finally she stood. She unbuttoned 
her blouse and took off her belt 
and dropped it to the ground be- 
side the body of the Man. She un- 
zipped her jodhpurs. Her voice was 
soft and low and sad. “There’s al- 
ways a snake in Eden, Billy Jack- 
son,” she said. She watched as he 
died. Then she turned toward the 
camp and screamed until Tony and 
Cynthe came, yelling, crashing 
through the brush. 

“I — we were — well ...” The 
big woman was buttoning up her 
blouse, Tony saw at once. Explana- 
tions were unnecessary. Somehow 
he was relieved. Bill was — had 
been — okay after all. He looked 



MANDROID 



49 




Oown at the other man, sprawled so 
peacefully beneath the towering 
Douglas fir. 

“I was over there,” Lily said. “I 
didn’t hear anything. But — when I 
said something and he didn’t an- 
swer, I came . found him . 
and the snake. I killed it.” 

His arm around Cynthe’s waist, 
Tony looked at Bill Jackson and 
fought a further feeling of relief. 
The man’s face — Tony had known 
he was dead the moment he saw 
him. Now he bent, noticing the 
marks in Bill’s shirt, realizing why 
it had been so fast. Almost in the 
heart. He pulled the knife from the 
dead rattler’s head. “He came a 
long way from home to do this,” 
Tony said. 

“And so did you, Texican. And 
so did I.” Lily buckled the belt 
and took the knife from him with 
a sigh. “So did I.” 

“We’ll bury him,” Tony said. “I 
think maybe right here, under the 
tree. Lily, if you can trust me now 
. please stay.” He tightened his 
fingers on Cynthe’s flank and she 
leaned into him. 

Lily hooked a thumb in her belt. 
“Just the three of us? Oh, come 
now, Tony. You don’t mean that. 
Three’s too many, Tony, whether 
it’s two men and a woman, or — ” 
she looked down at Bill — “or two 
women and a man. Oh, no. There’s 
no room in Eden for a Lilith. That 
would be as ridiculous as — ” 

^This is hardly what I’d call 
Eden,” Tony Baker said. He glanced 



at the girl beside him. “Or Nod 
either.” 

“ — as the Jabberwock,” Lilith 
finished. 

Jabberwock! The Mandroid open- 
ed the box, regarded the woven 
skein of a lifeline a moment, then 
cut it, irrevocably. As he did the 
tortured fabric of TimeSpace they 
had cut and spliced and reset so 
often — split, tore, ripped. The new 
Prime Mover waited. He did not 
vanish! He was /is /will be! Suc- 
cess! 

4 4''T^he what?” Tony asked. 

A “What’re you — ” 

“Tony!” Cynthe screamed. 

Lilith’s eyes rolled up. She went 
limp, sank to the ground, a limp 
rag, empty of life and being. Tony 
took one step forward. Then he 
halted with a cry. 

Lilith’s timeline was in the far 
future, the no-time, no-space, time- 
less and spaceless future of Tony’s 
descendants. She did not exist, not 
really, in this TimeSpace. In 
her/his/its time she became a hero 
by becoming a heretic; a great a 
hero as The Baker and The Synthe, 
The Firsts. 

In their time she ceased to exist. 
She was/is/will be not. 

Man and Android stared. There 
was no trace of Lilith. Yes, a trace; 
the smallish timber rattler, unwound- 
ed and undead but sore of jaw, shot 
off into the woods. Tony and Cyn- 
the watched it, uncomprehending. 

Ever. END

OUR MAN IN FANDOM 

FAN CLUBS U.S.A. 

by LIN CARTER 

Ever get the urge to talk 
S.F. with others? Here's 
how /o cfo ff . and why! 



C hances are, if you live in 
in or near a major U.S. City, 
there may be a local science-fiction 
fanclub in your vicinity. Wherever 
there are six 'or a dozen otherwise 
normal persons who share an in- 
terest in and enthusiasm for read- 
ing this kind of stuff, a fanclub 
tends to spring up. You may not 
even know there’s one right smack 
in your home town, because they 
don’t advertise, don’t usually pro- 
selytize, generally keep pretty much 
to themselves. That doesn’t mean 
they do not welcome fresh new 



members. They certainly do. And 
if you’d like to get together once 
in awhile with congenial people of 
similar lit’ry tastes it might be 
worth your while to look ’em up 
and drop around. 

I know of about twenty local 
science-fiction clubs currently ac- 
tive, and I’ll tell you about them 
in this column — and, if you’re 
what TIME magazine likes to call 
a “sci-fi addict” (a shuddersome 
neologism, if I ever heard one), 
why not pay the local club a visit? 
I can promise you an interesting 



51 




afternoon of talk, and the chance 
to make friends with people who 
have also succumbed to the appeal 
of Our Favorite Reading Matter. 

Eost Coast Fan Clubs 

I live in New York, and this siz- 
able tows has a long and fiend- 
ishly coimpiicated history of local 
fanclubs, dating back even before 
the golden days of Hugo Gerns- 
back’a **Science Fiction League”. 
In fac-t. New York seems to have 
been the home of the very, very first 
fanchib in the universe: something 
called The Seienceers, who came 
into existence around 1929 or ’30. 
As an added honor, this club pub- 
lished what May be the first fan- 
zine on record, a club periodical 
called The Planet (or something 
similar) which eurvived for about 
nine issues. 

Unlike fanadnes of today, which 
are largely concenied with fmnnish 
doings, this great-granddaddy of 
them all was pretty generally dedi- 
cated to seience fiction itself, as 
witness this Poem from the historic 
first issue: 

Burroughs, Cummings, Merritt, 
Kline, 

Burks and Leinster; none so 
fine, 

Ed Hamilton and Vic Rousseau 
With Capt\ Meek complete the 
show. 

In the field of science fiction, 
They're supreme, that's my con- 
viction." 

This determined doggerel is sign- 
ed “A.G.” which T presume stands 
for Allen Glasser, the first editor. 



Today, as befits this most mam- 
moth of metropoli {-Uses? -leis??), 
we New Yorkers rejoice in, not 
merely one, not just two, but a full 
three and one-half local fanclubs. 

The oldest, centered around the 
Bronx, is called The Lunarians. The 
second, located in Brooklyn, enjoys 
the name of The Fanoclasts. The 
third, an offshoot of Fanoclastism, 
is called (rather cryptically) FISFA, 
and meets in Manhattan. (The “one- 
half” cited above, is a fan group ef 
only sporadic activity, and currently 
defunct, I’d say, clustered about 
New York’s City College.) 

What about other cities here on 
the coast? Well, there’s a group up- 
state in Syracuse, N.Y., which made 
a bid for the site of the 1 966 World 
Science Fiction Convention — we’ll 
discuss the fine old tradition of the 
annual conventions in another in- 
stallment of this column — and, 
right across the Hudson in Newark, 
New Jersey, there’s a very large, 
very active and quite old fanclub 
called ESFA (Eastern Science Fic- 
tion Association). Unlike its more 
informal Gotham cousins, ESFA has 
genuine club officers and elections, 
and puts on formal meetings with 
Guest Speakers and all. 

Then there’s a fanclub down in 
Baltimore, Maryland, and a lively 
group in Washington, D.C., the 
yearly hosts of a regional “conclave” 
called the Disclave (we’ll cover the 
local and regional get-togethers in a 
forthcoming O.M.I.F., I promise), 
and Boston is home to a club of 
college students at M.I.T.

ciety, one of the nation’s biggest 
fanciubs« and (with the Los Angeles 
club) jK)ssibly the nation’s oldest. It 
got started about 1935 and has been 
going strong ever since, having al- 
ready been the host to two World 
Conventions. 

The only club I know of still go- 
ing in the South is a group in Char- 
lotte, North Carolina. But, in days 
of old, there was a fanclub in New 
Orleans, and, in addition, one in my 
own home town, St. Petersburg, 
Florida. 

Fanclubs in the Mid-West 

O ut in what H. L. Mencken used 
to call, rather disrespectfully, 
“the Bible-and-Hookworm Belt” 
there are fewer fanclubs. 

Chicago has one (at least), and 
so do Detroit, Michigan, and Cin- 
cinnati, Ohio, and then there’s Cleve- 
land, former home of Harlan Ellison 
and current home of Andre Norton 
. Cleveland, by the way, folks, 
will be the site of this year’s World 
Convention, rather bafflingly yclept 
Tricon, but I will tell you about that 
anon. 

Another major midwest group, 
now extinct, centered about Jackson, 
and Battle Cr^k, Michigan, and en- 
joyed the name of. the Galactic 
Roamers. One of the pioneer sf 
writers, that all-time great-of-greats 
E. E. Smith, Ph.D., belonged to the 
Roamers, and used to read aloud his 
stories while they were in-the-works 
to memlws, for criticism, comment 
and suggestions. Alas! Doc Smith is 
no longer with us — nor are the 
Galactic Roamers, either! 



Fanclubs on the West-Coast 

C alifornia has always been a ma- 
jor center of fanclubbing, fan- 
zining and fan activity in general. 
Los Angeles houses one of the most 
famed and venerable of all such 
groups, the redoubtable LASFS (Los 
Angeles Science Fantasy Society," in 
abbreviation, and in conversation 
pronounced ''lass- fuss"') The LASFS 
competes with the Philly fanclub for 
the title of oldest, but it’s a toss-up 
either way. 

Then, over in Berkeley, there’s a 
lively little club who delight in the 
cognomen, The Elves', Gnomes' and 
Little Men's Chowder, Science-Fic- 
tion and Marching Society (a charm- 
ing name which they borrowed from 
Crockett Johnson’s now sadly de- 
funct but immortal in memory comic 
strip, Barnaby), Most fanclubs are 
known familiarly by their initials, but 
happily this group chose not to call 
themselves the EGALMCMASFS, 
but "the Little Men.” 

(Incidentally, don’t get the notion 
fanclubs are made up of naught but 
fans alone . lots of important sf 
writers, illustrators, editors, etc., be- 
long, if they are in the vicinity. Wit- 
ness Doc Smith and the Galactic 
Roamers, above. And the Little Men 
number among their membership 
Jack Vance and Poul and Karen 
Anderson, to say nothing of An- 
thony Boucher, mystery-reviewer for 
The New York Times, and founder 
of The Magazine of Fantasy & 
Science Fiction. L. Sprague de Camp 
is a frequent dropper-in to the do- 
ings in Philadelphia; Ace Books’ 
editor Donald A. Wollheim and IF's 



FAN CLUBS U.S.A.

cover artist Jack Gaughan, visit New 
York’s Fanoclasts from time to time, 
and other science fiction profession- 
als belong to local groups. And, be- 
yond the scope of a column on fan 
clubs, but worthy of mention, is yet 
another of New York’s institutions. 
The Hydra Club — as far as is be- 
knownst to me, the only local fan 
club for sf professionals anywhere 
around. Willy Ley, Lester Del Rey, 
Robert Silverberg, Hans Stefan San- 
lesson — former editor of Fantastic 
Universe — sf writer’s agent Henry 
Morrison, and others in the New 
York area — including myself — be- 
long.) 

San Francisco is home to a club 
called The Golden Gate Futurians, 
and there are other clubs rumored 
to exist in the outlying regions of 
California — one that I know of, for 
example, in San Diego. 

There is also a fanclub in Seattle, 
Washington, and there is another — 
or up until fairly recently, at least, 
there was — in Portland, Oregon. 

So there you have the twenty-odd 
clubs still active — and if I’ve left 
out yours, by inadvertance, from this 
brief, informal survey, don’t be hurt. 
Clubs come and go, spring up over- 
night, vanish just as quickly. And, 
even though not listed here, there 
may very well be one in your town. 
After all, somebody buys up all those 
science fiction magazines and paper- 
backs at your comer drugstore. 

What Happens In a Fandub? 

I have been a member of, drop- 
ped in on, visited, and even 
been guest speaker at, a variety of 



fanclubs on the East Coast, and I 
think I can answer the question 
burning in your mind. What do they 
do? 

Most of them meet twice a month 
(some meet weekly; others, only 
monthly; let’s not quibble!) These 
meetings range all the way from the 
formality of ESFA and LASFS (with 
club officers, elections, constitutions 
and formal programs) . down to 
the informality that marks a Fano- 
clast meeting. Your formal program 
usually consists of one or two guest 
speakers. Maybe they will invite a 
local or visiting sf author or editor 
to give a brief talk; maybe a mem- 
ber who visited a distant regional or 
world con will give a “report”, some, 
times even a slide-show or home- 
movie of con-doin’s. 

Your informal meeting is just a 
regular get-together of local fans or 
readers who like to spend the after- 
noon with friends and acquaintances 
of similar interests, for a good old- 
fashioned gabfest. There may be a 
few records on the hi fi . cans 
of cold beer in the kitchen ... a 
bowl of pretzels on the coffee-table. 
New York’s Lunarians used to have, 
and maybe still do, a giant 18 -cup 
coffee-maker well-stocked and avail- 
able to the membership. 

But whatever the culinary prepar- 
ations be (or lack of same, on a 
BYOB or “bring-yer-own-beer” ba- 
sis), you simply sit around and con- 
verse. Not necessarily about science- 
fiction, I hasten to add: talk can and 
does range through movies, pop art, 
comic books, radio serials, Bette 
Davis, Shakespeare, fan scandals . and 
feuds, Dali or Picasso, Mozart, Alex

Raymond and Hal Foster, Batman, 
George Pal, the ‘Cyclic’ poets, Ez- 
ra Pound, new fanzines, forthcoming 
conventions, the latest paperbacks, 
TV commercials and (sometimes) 
shows, pre-Columbian art, Hannes 
Bok, Burroughs, ‘Conan’, Sherlock 
Holmes, the Oz books, jazz, folk 
music, cars, sex, religion, politics, 
Viet Nam, draft-card burners, com- 
munism, Tolkien, old movie serials, 
James Bond and damn near anything 
else you can think of, up to and 
including Ghek the Kaldane and 
Qadgop the Mercotan! 

Now sometimes fanclubs hold 
their meetings in the home of a 
member — as do New York’s Fano- 
clasts and Lunarians — other clubs 
rent facilities from local halls (such 
as the ESFA in Newark and the 
PSFS in Philadelphia), For local 
conclaves, regional conferences and 
world conventions (of course, space 
is reserved in rented halls or hotels. 
Clubs which convene in a member’s 
home frequently switch around from 



home to home ... as, for instance, 
the Fanoclasts met first, and for 
awhile, at the East Side apartment 
of Dick Lupoff, later in the Bronx 
apartment of Lin Carter, and are 
now getting together twice a month 
at Ted White’s apartment in Brook- 
lyn. 

And it is not entirely unknown for 
an occasional, lucky club to actually 
Own A Whole Building All By It- 
self. I seem to remember that such 
was the case in Los Angeles, with 
the far-famed Bixel Street headquar- 
ters of the LASFS. 

But large or small, formal or cas- 
ual, hither or yon, fanclubs are fun. 
Look one up, if you live in any of 
the cities named above: spend an 
evening or an afternoon getting to 
know other people who also like 
science fiction. Fanzine publishing 
or writing may not be your meat — 
but no one who likes science fiction 
can fail to make interesting new 
friends and find congenial conversa- 
tion in a fanclub. END

The Weapons 
That Walked 

by D. M. MELTON 

Illustrated by ADKIKS 

Somtihing on the planet warred 
against Man — and its weapons 
were the deadliest ever known! 



I 

I n most situations Joe Hanley was 
even tempered and tended to 
look on the bright side. But halfway 
down to the surface of Kasti III, 
with the landing boat falling like a 
rock, there just wasn’t any bright 
side. 

Joe got the E-Ship on the horn. 
When Ensign Holman’s tumble-hair- 
ed, heart-shaped face appeared in the 
tank he yelled, “Slim! I need a grap- 
ple tug, fast! And get me the Maint 
Chief. I turned in a squawk sheet a 
week ago about the antigrav on this 



boat! . That was when he came 
as close as he ever did to losing 
his temper. Beyond an absent mod 
she turned back to the computer con- 
sole and ignored him. 

He hung on, fu-mlng. Presently, in 
spite of himself, he calmed down 
and began to chuckle. 

From what he could see and hear. 
Commander Thornton was up to his 
ears in some kind of emergency, too. 
And it had to be urgent, because al- 
though a single, gentle tap would do 
it, the commander’s stubby thumb 
was jabbing repeatedly at the Panic 
Button. Soon he saw that the com- 



56 




mander had heard his call to Slim, 
for the stubby thumb started alter- 
nating between the General Quarters 
button and the Maint Chiefs call. 

Joe frowned thoughtfully. Faintly 
he could hear the GQ klaxons howl- 
ing in the corridors. That meant 
somebody else was in trouble, too, 
probably the team already down on 
K-IV. Well, that was The Thorn’s 
job — to prod them all when they 
needed it, and to worry about them 
all when they were in trouble. And 
sure enough, soon, between jabs, 
Thornton caught his eye in the 
screen. 

“Joe! We can’t send a tug down 
to catch you. Trouble on IV. You 
abort! Blast out of that thing!” 

Joe watched and listened a few 
more seconds — long enough to hear 
Ensign Holman, calmly doing three 
or four other things at the same 
time, instruct Albert, the computer, 
to take the E-Ship out of orbit, full 
emergency, and also track Joe down, 
pinpoint his touchdown, and tape it 
all. Quite a gal, that tall, black 
headed Martian. She’d do to have 
along. 

Then he turned back to his own 
problem. He caught a glimpse of 
the wooded surface of K-III rushing 
up at him. Lt tended to spur him on. 
(Later Hohnan told him, with some- 
thing ajpproaohing a giggle, that he 
had been scrabbling like a Martian 
sand crab on the floor of a dome.) 
But he wrestled the failing antigrav, 
by the book and by improvising, un- 
til it flickered out completely. While 
that doomed his mission it did stop 
the snapping, off-and-on action that 
had been shaking his brains and 



stomach lcx)se. And it also told him 
it was time to go, for by then the 
boat was in atmosphere, falling free, 
red hot and tumbling. 

He made a fast check of the few 
items he could take with him, lock- 
ed the escape pod and jabbed his 
own Panic Button, grinning when he 
noticed that although a single, gentle 
tap would do it, he had punched it 
three times! ffis stomach flipped 
through two more on-and-off G pulls 
— once with the slamming explosion 
of ejection and again, happily, when 
the big chute jerked open. Then his 
muttering at the Maint Section eas- 
ed off, for from then on everything 
went by the book. The pod settled 
right side up, in the clearing for 
which he had aimed it, with every- 
thing intact and functioning. 

A s the yellow cloud of nylon set- 
tled beside him he let out his 
breath in a long sigh of relief. He 
was down, he thought wryly, in a 
landing he could walk away from. 
But it sure wasn’t according to plan, 
either the E-Service plan or his own. 

The last he shrugged aside. His 
own plans were long range anyway, 
and he knew the odds. About one 
possible site for life in every fifteen 
hundred cubic light years. All you 
could do was try, and he was a pa- 
tient man, 

Joe’s patience, In fact, and his 
quiet manner and soft speech, had 
been known to lead some people to 
misjudge him. Off watch he was 
generally found sitting on the back 
of his neck in the lounge, seemingly 
with no thought but for the moment, 
and always within voice or gesture

range of the coffee robot. But scat- 
tered through as much of the galaxy 
as the Exploration Service had so far 
opened you could find any number 
of junior officers, wardroom space- 
lawyers and not a few aggressive 
alien life forms who had learned, 
witih varying degrees of shock, that 
until you got to know him it was 
wiser not to crowd him. 

So while most of the eager first- 
trippers really wanted the point spot 
in the surface survey of Kasti III, 
nobody pressed after he told them, 
“Look! My name is up and I’ve 
taken my share of Mars-type sand 
craters and methane swamp worlds. 
What’s wrong with my dropping in, 
for a change, on a planet where you 
can breathe?” 

The Drive Engineer, who had 
trained with Joe back at Vanden- 
berg, let a mock-serious look 
sweep around the table and back 
to Joe. “Nothing wrong, Joe. Only 
you do have this habit of wander- 
ing off into the woods, when there 
are woods to wander off into. It’s 
time consuming. But, of course, it’s 
just your early upbringing showing. 

Joe grinned. “You grew up in the 
same place, Chief.” 

“Yes but I did grow up. You see 
— ” the Chief waved his cup at the 
circle of faces — “Joe comes from 
Terra, northern California, where be- 
lieve it or not there are still a couple 
of hundred square kilometers of for- 
est, with wildlife yet. When we were 
kids there, they would let you hunt 
only with rifle-mount cameras. But 
Joe’s a shade atavistic. Why, this trip 
he even tried to sneak a combination 
fly-rod and shotgun on board.” 



Joe grinned again and lounged 
back deeper in his chair. “Wrong, 
Chief. The handle wasn’t a shotgun, 
although that’s an idea. It converted 
into a hunting bow. And if you’d just 
kept your big mouth shut — ” 

The Chief looked pained. “I was 
thinking, as always, of the good of 
the service, and trying to keep The 
Thorn out of your side. But even 
so, when you draw the point spot 
on a planet like III your test sites 
still seem to always turn up near po- 
tential bird runs or fishing streams.” 
“Part of the point’s job is to check 
out the fauna.” 

“But your methods, Joe! Remem- 
ber Palma I? Those amphibians you 
were illegally angling for turned out 
to be highly intelligent?” 

Joe squirmed uncomfortably. “I 
wasn’t fishing for them,” he defend- 
ed. “And I made friends with them, 
finally.” 

“Sure you did.” The Chief nod- 
ded owlishly. “You had to. Since it 
turned out the one you snagged was 
that tribe’s equivalent of medicine 
man. And I’ll grant that required 
tact, considering where you snagged 
him. Embarrassing! How would you 
like to be . .” 

The chime broke In with Joe’s sig- 
nal, and Ensign Holman’s flawless 
intercom voice called his name. 
“Thirty minutes to drop. Captain.” 
Joe drained his cup, told the Chief 
where he could go, and palmed his 
coffee ration tab into the Chiefs slot 
on the dispenser robot. The robot 
rolled on down the table bubbling 
happily. It couldn’t care less, and 
eventually the Chief would yell his 
head off.

THE WEAPONS THAT WALKED 



59 



Joe made his way forward, toward 
the computer and control room. But 
on the way, after a series of inno- 
cent glances back down the empty 
corridor, he ducked into the supply 
section, making a fast, last minute 
check for pocket size items that 
could be converted into fishing tac- 
kle. Mostly this E-work was dreary 
and dangerous, much of it drudgery. 
You rarely found a pretty little world 
like III, all woods and streams and 
fresh air. This just might at long last 
be the one he was looking for. Any- 
way, nobody was going to talk him 
out of this drop. 

X Tobody did. But now, he thought 
soberly as he looked around 
him, he’d about as soon somebody 
had. Here he sat, his boat and equip- 
ment off somewhere in the woods in 
pieces, with the E-Ship pulling away. 

He turned the pod’s little vision 
tank and a quick glance showed him 
the ship was still too busy to talk 
with him. He relaxed, but his relief 
at being all in one piece was marred 
by a vague uneasiness. 

He shook it off. A new planet, no 
matter what kind, always made you 
feel that way. He unstrapped, and 
opened the p^. After all, Albert had 
long since sent down homing scoop 
missiles and checked out the sea 
water and the air. He drew in a deep, 
satisfying breath and let it out with 
an equally long si^ of relief. Fresh! 
It had the rich, green smell of things 
growing in soil instead of hydro- 
ponic tanks. It smelled like home. 
There was something a little like 
cedar, and a salty, seaweed smell 
from the beach not too far away. 



Ihere was the smell of a lush, re- 
cently wet, meadow. But there was 
also something — at which he frown- 
ed slightly — that reminded him of 
a well kept but crowded zoo. 

That faint animal smell brought 
back the vague feeling of uneasiness. 
And now, close up, K-III didn’t seem 
quite the same as it had when he 
had studied it with Ensign Holman 
in the E-Ship’s big screens. The En- 
sign had brushed that tumbling 
black hair from her eyes and waved 
a slim hand at the computer banks 
which made up one wall of her sec- 
tion. 

“Albert has told us all he can 
about III, from up here. But it 
sha{>es up like a jewel, close to being 
Terra’s twin.” 

Joe had shaken his head, and had 
felt a note of bitterness in his voice. 
“Not Terra’s twin now. Terra’s twin 
before there were people, maybe.” 

She laughed. “That’s right. You’re 
the one who thinks man should take 
a bold step backward.” 

“Nope. I just think he shouldn’t 
trample everything underfoot. You 
grew Up under those plasteel domes 
on Mars . although — ” he smiled 
briefly — “it doesn’t show. You must 
have spent a lot of time in the One- 
Gee gyms when you were growing 
up. But you wouldn’t know about 
forests and streams.” 

She nodded. “You’re right. Our 
flowers came from hydroponic 
farms.” 

“Well, the people on Terra pick 
their flowers from hydroponic tanks, 
too, now. They invented the bull- 
dozer a couple of hundred years be- 
fore they invented the FTL drive

IF 




and antigrav. By that time, Terra 
was no longer a jewel. It was prac- 
tically all paved.” 

She laughed. “I’ve been there. And 
I’ve talked with the Chief. He told 
me you both grew up in one of the 
last National Parks. Said your dad, 
a Ranger, once accidentally cut a 
bulldozer in half. A laser misfire.” 

Joe’s lips quirked. “Well, those 
first rifles weren’t dependable. But 
the accident did save a three thou- 
sand year old redwood, for a while. 
But what about III here? What can 
I expect?” 

“Albert has printed up a summary 
for you. Kasti is Sol type, and III, 
while smaller, checks out very close 
to Terra, or, as you say, Terra a 
thousand years back. No people, but 
ii has seas, forests, streams and all 
kinds of things that fly, swim and 
walk.” 

Joe’s eyes lit up. “Untouched! 
How about things that sting, claw 
and bite?” 

Ensign Holman had smiled, and 
her blue eyes scanned the six feet 
from his square jawed, close cropped 
head to his plasteel boots. “There are 
some. Must be in a balanced ecol- 
ogy. But that’s why they issue those 
laser rifles to you broad-shouldered 
pioneer types*. Still, there’s no indi- 
cation of anything down there any 
more intelligent than a bright chim- 
panzee or formidable than a rhino- 
ceros. Just find us a site for the lab 
huts and we’ll be down and protect 
you.” 

Joe had grinned at her then. Now, 
at the memory he laughed ruefully. 
There wasn’t much he could do to- 
ward a preliminary survey. Without 



the landing boat and its equipment 
he was left with packaged rations, 
his suit, and the short barreled laser 
rifle. His hand gun as always he was 
wearing. It added up, at best, to 
survival. 

II 

Y et the park-like glade Jooked as 
safe as a suburban back yard 
when he stepped out of the pod. He 
let the helmet swing back and 
breathed deeply. 

The air was still pungent with the 
odor of growing things. He could 
hear bird sounds, some musical, some 
raucous as an indignant blue jay. The 
breeze was soughing through a tall, 
sequoia-like tree some fifty yards 
away. 

For an instant hk spiiite lifted. 
This was a pretty little world. Then 
he became wary as it came to him 
that the sounds he heard were all 
distant. Nearby it was a little too 
quiet. The faint zoo sm^ was strong- 
er, and he had the distinct feeling 
he was being watched. 

He moved away from the pod. 
The signs showed that grazing ani- 
mals of some kind fed over this 
meadow. The wdnd again drew his 
attention to the tree. It towered 
there in splendid isolation, beautiful 
as a mountain redwood. But there 
was something about It that wasn’t 
quite right. He flipped down the hel- 
met and took a long binocular look 
through the faceplate. 

It did look a little like a redwood, 
except the branches were smaller 
and closer together. It was a tree 
that could be climbed. Tlie needle

leaves were mostly clustered at the 
outer tips of the branches, and high- 
magnification showed the lower, ma- 
tured needles flared at the base, with 
tips dark and sharp. 

“Darts?” he wondered, frowning. 
The thought drew his gaze down- 
ward and he realized what it was 
about the tree that was different. 
The grass under it was undisturbed. 
His lips pursed in a thoughtful 
whistle. “Oh-oh! And the grass eat- 
ers know how close they can feed. I 
wonder what triggers it?” 

He walked the perimeter of the 
circle of rich grass. There had to be 
some way of finding out without 
walking in there. 

He thought of the hand gun at his 
belt. The pellet could be set to ex- 
plode on impact, with about double 
the force of an old fashioned, hand 
thrown grenade. But he wanted to 
see what the tree’s reaction was to 
a walking animal — or man. It didn’t 
react to movement. He could see 
cricket-like bugs busy in the grass, 
arid, while he was watching, some 
kind of bat-like flying thing spotted 
him, darted aside, and flew with im- 
punity under the spreading branches. 

He turned away, glancing at the 
pod, reassured by his estimate that 
he could reach the entry port in sec- 
onds. Then a flash of movement 
near the stream caught his eye. 

He drew the hand gun and turned 
toward the pod just as three lean, 
cat-like shapes burst from cover and 
converged from three directions. As 
he circled the tree he muttered irri- 
tably into his suit radio. 

“I hope you can still see and hear 
me. Holman. Look at those things! 



‘Nothing down there any more in- 
telligent than a bright chimpanzee!’ 
you say!” For at his first move the 
cats changed course, one making for 
the pod. Their obvious intention was 
to either cut him down or force him 
back, under the tree. 

A dozen strides told him he would 
lose the race. These things were in- 
credibly fast. He stopped, dropped 
to one knee, and steadied the hand 
gun in both palms. The weapon 
grunted spitefully and the pellet 
burst three feet in front of the near- 
est cat. He saw it spin end over end 
as he wheeled to face the others. 
The gun grunted again, and the sec- 
ond cat disintegrated. He turned 
again, but the third cat had swerved 
abruptly and was headed back for 
cover. Frowning, he watched it dis- 
appear. Then he walked over to the 
sprawled animal he had stunned and 
used a non-explosive pellet just to 
be sure. 

C lose up, it still looked something 
like a cat — a cross between a 
puma and a weasel, with some night- 
marish overtones. It was a fanged 
and clawed predator, hairless and 
lean, all chest and no belly, built for 
speed. Again he looked around. Then 
he gingerly picked up the cat and 
whirled like a hammer thrower, toss- 
ing the carcass as far as he could. 

Carefully he stepped off the dis- 
tance. Then he carried it back to 
the tree. 

Even though he had guessed what 
would happen he was shaken by the 
tree’s reaction. When the ho ly struck 
the ground inside the circle of un- 
disturbed grass the branches above 



62 



IF 




the point of impact lashed into mo- 
tion. The tips whipped up and then 
down, and there was a harsh, tear- 
ing sound. " 

Dozens of dart-shaped needles 
hissed into the ground and into the 
body of the cat. 

But he was unprepared for what 
followed. There was a stirring in the 
grass as writhing, off-white roots 
worked up out of the ground. The 
network thickened and Joe shudder- 
ed as he turned back to the pod. 

Back inside, he opened a mug of 
coffee, waited a moment for it to 
heat, and laced it with medkit bran- 
dy. He glanced warily around the 
now empty meadow and then turn- 
ed to the pod’s little communicator 
tank. The tank hummed softly, but 
showed only a swirling pattern of 
color. He checked the tuning and 
then called, “Slim, can you hear 
me?” 

Ensign Holman’s voice came back 
clearly. “Loud and clear. Captain. 
And you should watch your lan- 
guage. But we’re nearly out of direct 
visual range. What’s with the tree?” 

“The tree we stay away from. It’s 
a people eater.” 

“We suspected as much when we 
saw you stun and use that first ani- 
mal instead of blowing it apart. That 
was good shooting.” 

“Now what would a computer 
operator know about shooting?” 

“Don’t be smug. You forget I 
went through the same boot camp 
you did, only a few years later — 
when it was a few degrees tougher. 
I can use a hand gun, too. But there’s 
no time to exchange compliments. 
We’ve launched some communica- 



tion satellites, and one of them 
should be in range soon. But we can 
see enough without it to tell you 
there’s something unusual going on 
around you. Movement, all around, 
but we can’t tell what. We’ll pick you 
up through the comsats soon. But 
The Thorn says watch it! Out’* 

Joe scowled, sipped some more 
coffee, and looked around the mea- 
dow. Watch it! he thought sardon- 
ically. What did Thornton and that 
good-looking Martian think he would 
be doing? The meadow was still emp- 
ty — or was it? A thin, rasping 
scream tore at his ears. Oh-oh! His 
cat was back, with a half dozen of 
its brothers, prowling near the edge 
of the glade but keeping their dis- 
tance. And there was a grunting, 
wheezing sound, too, growing loud- 
er. 

He locked the communicator’s vi- 
deo eyes on a moving bulk in the 
distant trees. The vision tank brought 
in an image of an animal as mon- 
strous as the cats and nearly as ugly. 

It was larger than the rhino Hol- 
man had mentioned. It had longer 
legs, and there was no horn on it’s 
horse-faced head. It looked as if it 
could run, should occasion demand. 
And as it moved its sides seemed to 
reflect dull highlights. He zoomed 
in close and again whistled. “Shades 
of Georgie Patton! It’s the tank 
corps!” 

T he highlights were reflections 
from thick, horny plates, appar- 
ently rubbed smooth on the sides, 
which made up the animal’s hide. 
Even the horse face was armored, 
the eyes mere holes in a solid plate

Oi horn. Joe gulped the remaining 
coffee and grimly checked the rifle. 

Outside, tense and ready, he sur- 
veyed the meadow. 

Cats aiid other unidentified prowl- 
ers, no doubt predators, now ringed 
the perimeter. Those, he thought, he 
could handle, unless they all rushed 
at once. But there were now four of 
the big “ihinhorses”, and they might 
be hard to stop, depending on how 
fast they were. They looked fast 
And any one of them could push the 
pod around like an empty ration 
carton. 

He waited, scowling thoughtfully. 
There had been something odd about 
the tree. Now there was something 
odd about this. Some defensive in- 
stinct flashed warning after warn- 
ing. 

Then it came to him that this was 
shaping into a pattern. And he didn’t 
like the patt^i at all. This menag- 
erie was bdiaving as if it had been 
summoned and was being directed! 

Two of the rhinhorses had turned, 
skirting the edge of the meadow, and 
were plodding purposefully around 
behind him. If they rushed, and he 
failed to stop them, they would over- 
run him or force him back toward 
the tree. 

The treel A thought struck him, 
but he rejected it. He had seen some 
fantastic fliings in the way of far-out 
life f<Hms, but he wasn’t ready to 
accept tdepathic plant life. It just 
couldn^t be that overgrown thorn 
bush. Then he muttered angrily at 
himself. Of course! How stupid could 
you get? It was something he had 
overlooked, never thought of. Some- 
tiding in the tree! 



There was no time for a second 
survey. One of the rhinhorses was 
moving in at a trot, speeding to 
what could soon be a headlong 
charge. He raised the laser, then 
lowered it. He was figuring on com- 
ing out of this alive. And for now, 
at least, the pod was home and head- 
quarters. He didn’t want an esti- 
mated two tons of alien carrion ma- 
turing on his doorstep. It was worth 
a try. He drew the hand gun and 
placed a pellet in front of the now 
charging beast. At the explosion it 
swerved and snorted. He placed an- 
other to one side, and another. The 
animal tossed its head, bellowing 
and wheezing. But it turned away, 
slowing to a trot. 

The others stopped, and all were 
watching. For an instant there seem- 
ed no movement anywhere. 

Again he looked up at the tree. 
He saw no target, but a good-sized 
climber could be concealed anywhere 
behind the trunk. And now the me- 
nagerie was stirring again, getting 
restless. Abruptly he raised the rifle 
and swept a cutting beam across the 
base of the tree. 

As the beam hit, the animals mill- 
ed as if in sudden confusion. The 
base of the tree smoked and the 
trunk swayed, seeming to hang in 
mid air as it slowly toppled. Then, 
with the falling trunk midway in its 
arc, something ape-like, which re- 
minded Joe of a monstrous flying 
lemur, spread its gliding membranes 
and soared from the upper branches. 
It drifted toward the brushy area 
near the stream and Joe saw an- 
other rhinhorse burst from cover 
and make for the gliding figure. The 



64 



IF 




big animal was running with remark- 
able speed, and the soaring figure 
glided to its back, scrambling and 
beating its arms as it groped for foot- 
hold. 

As the rhinhorse and its rider dis- 
appeared, the other animals milled. 
Joe went into a crouch, ready for a 
rush. He waited, sizing up the mill- 
ing ring, choosing spots where either 
the laser or the hand gun would be 
more effective. Then, gradually, he 
relaxed, staring about with growing 
conviction. He was right! This me- 
nagerie had been assembled and di- 
rected. And now it was losing inter- 
est! 

The remaining rhinhorses had 
started placidly cropping grass, ig- 
noring him completely. The cats fad- 
ed back into the forest, all except 
one, which was singlemindedly pur- 
suing dinner at the far edge of the 
glade. While he watched, the cat 
made its kill, one of its late allies, 
and carried it off without a back- 
ward glance. 

Ill 

J oe’s next prescription of medkit 
brandy went down neat. He 
needed it. The pod communicator 
beeped, and he fine-tuned the E- 
Ship’s band. 

The tank cleared to reveal Com- 
mander TTiornton’s craggy features. 
Thornton’s face fractured into one 
of its rare smiles. “The comsat 
caught up with you. We got most of 
that, and we’re still recording. That 
was quite a show. Captain.” 

Joe grimaced. “I’m glad somebody 
liked it. Commander. I sure didn’t. 



And I have the feeling I’m going to 
like it less later on. These carnivores 
are playing for keeps, or at least 
their boss is. How soon can you get 
some people and equipment down 
here?” 

“Soon, Joe. Five-six days. The 
people on IV are in worse shape, than 
you. Earthquake, and their dome is 
losing air, with the outside atmo- 
sphere mostly ammonia. You hole 
up somewhere and hang on. We’ll 
be back.” 

Thornton’s face shifted aside and 
Ensign Holman’s wide blue eyes 
went over him. She gave him a brief, 
non-service smile, then sobered and 
spoke briskly. “You bandied that ef- 
ficiently, Captain. Albert says those 
animals were almost certainly being 
directed, probably by some tele- 
pathic means, by that thing which 
glided out of the tree. He says — ” 

Joe broke in with amused irrita- 
tion. “You and Albert! You’re even 
getting so you talk like him. Look, 
Slim, you could use transistors for 
brains and figure that one out. How 
much detail did you get? Could you 
see where it went? Run the tape.” 

She nodded, and presently she 
said, “See? South of you, three or 
four kilometers, on that knoll with 
more trees around it. Watch! What- 
ever it was riding, that big animal 
scrambled off and climbed to the 
rocks at the top.” 

“I’ve got it. Could be it Mves there, 
although I doubt if that matters 
much. Did you see where my boat 
crashed? I might be able to ^vage 
something.” 

“No tape, but the Chief was mon- 
itoring.” 



THE WEAPONS THAT WALKED 



65 




Joe saw the drive engineer’s face 
move into the screen beside Holman. 
“You cut it pretty fine, Joe,” he 
said. “The boat went in only a cou- 
ple of kilometers east of you. But 
there can’t be much left of it. Spare 
computer and power units maybe, 
if you’re lucky.” 

Joe grimaced wryly. “Big help!” 

The Chiefs face split in a wide 
grin. “Why so glum, Joe? Aren’t you 
the guy who always finds a bright 
side? This is the chance you’ve been 
waiting for. Nothing to do for the 
next week but fish and hunt. Live it 
up!” 

Joe almost yelled his exasperation. 
“Live it up. Fish and hunt. Why, you 
idiot, didn’t you see that tape Slim 
just ran?” 

“Sure. But what — ” 

“But what! The what is that I’m 
not the one that is going to be doing 
the hunting. That big, ugly flying 
ape, with his pack of killer cats and 
armor plated herbivora, is going to 
be hunting mer 

T he image in the tank was begin- 
ning to waver. The E-Ship, 
“falling” outward toward K-IV at 
the full acceleration of that big plan- 
et’s gravity, was nearly out of visual 
range of the comsats. 

The Chief, frowning thoughtfully, 
moved aside and Ensign Holman’s 
heart-shaped face filled the screen. 
The image blurred, and that, Joe 
thought, probably accounted for the 
fact that she no longer looked cool 
and calm. Then the image blurred 
out and the tank became a swirling 
mass of color. But her voice came 
in strongly, the waver in it probably 



just transmission surge as the corn- 
sat boosters stepped up the signal. 
“Take care, pioneer. We’ll be back!” 

Joe stared out at his now not so 
pretty little world. No, he thought, 
it’s as pretty as ever. But it has some 
unfriendly flora and fauna, some ag- 
gressively dangerous. That big flying 
ape — Joe found himself thinking of 
it as “The Hunter” — had run. But 
it had lost only a skirmish, not a war. 
It had to run, after Joe cut its com- 
mand and observation post out from 
under it. Assuming it was intelligent 
as well as telepathic, and it would be 
stupid to assume anything else, it 
now knew as much about Joe’s wea- 
pons as Joe knew about its wea- 
pons. 

An inconsistency or two nagged at 
Joe. This “bright chimpanzee”, this 
hunter, had gone after Joe on sight, 
true enough. But why hadn’t he sent 
his whole menagerie in to overrun 
Joe? And the tree! Surely he couldn’t 
control that spastic monstrosity. How 
had he gotten up there? 

Joe mused, absently watching the 
big, ugly rhinhorses placidly feeding 
away from him. And it reminded 
him the hunter had glided down to 
one of them from the upper branch- 
es. Of course! A running glide could 
have carried the hunter over the 
sensitive root area, in past the branch 
tips. From there he could climb. 

Joe sighed, and came to his feet. 
The rest of it was tomorrow’s prob- 
lem. The sun was dropping, and he 
had to find a rocky hideout of his 
own, since the pod offered no pro- 
tection at all. And it looked like he 
was going to be the quarry in a 
dangerous if not deadly game of hide 



66 



IF 




and seek. But he stood there, finish- 
ing the coffee, still thinking, and the 
more he thought of holing up the 
less he liked it. Probably his best 
defense would be a hard and deter- 
mined offense. He would go hunting 
himself! 

And there was something else. He 
looked around, musing. He had been 
searching for something for a long 
time and this might be it. But he 
could never, reasonably, expect it to 
be handed to him on a silver plate. 
He had to find out, once and for all, 
if he could cope with this planet. He 
looked out toward the surrounding 
woods and presently he said aloud, 
“I don’t know where you are, fellow, 
or whether or not you can read my 
mind. But if you can, you better get 
set. Tomorrow you and I are going 
to go- for brokel” 

H is preparations didn’t take long. 
There wasn’t much he could 

take. 

The suit hampered movement 
slightly, but it would provide protec- 
tion against nuisance attacks. Small 
predators, or bad-tempered snake 
types, if any, would only bend their 
fangs on it. He wasnT at all sure 
about the dart-tree needles, undoubt- 
edly poison.^ He gathered up the 
laser, a food pack, a thermos. He 
hoped the rhinhorses would ignore 
the pod, with him out of it. He closed 
the port and started cautiously across 
the meadow, south, toward the area 
where Slim’s tape had shown the 
hunter had gone to ground. In his 
mind he and the hunter had already 
changed roles. 

Under other circumstances his first 



night on III might have been enjoy- 
able. There were trees, many with a 
familiar look, which reminded him 
of the few remaining forest patches 
at home. Other trees were weirdly 
different, having the look of giani 
ferns. The dart trees were few, and 
easily avoided, although they did 
grow in clumps or rows in places. 
He paused momentarily at the edge 
of a stream, briefly lost in« nostalgia 
at the purling whisper of water over 
the rocks. Once he crouched, alert, 
but the sound which had startled him 
was only something small and bound- 
ing, the fleeing, furry equivalent, he 
guessed, of a terran cottontail. 

Presently he found what he want- 
ed. 

He was in a sparsely wooded val- 
ley now, the ground rising steadilv 
but gently. At the edge of a dry 
stream bed he found a rocky forma- 
tion open only on one side, with 
enough overhang so nothing could 
drop on him from above. Branches, 
cut with the laser, he piled in front. 
His brushwood barricade would stop 
nothing, but nothing could get 
through it without making enough 
noise to warn him. 

IV 

H e slept fitfully at first, but later 
he must have slept soundly, for 
he woke feeling rested, to bird 
sounds, mostly musical. 

He yawned and stretched, savor- 
ing the sight, sound and smell of a 
damp woodland warming in the sun. 
He smiled to himself. This was it! 
This was what had sent him into the 
E-Service. 



THE WEAPONS THAT WALKED 



67 




Then he came to his feet, alert, 
when the birds to one side went 
suddenly silent, reminding him of 
the business at hand. As he stood up 
one of the cats, standing motionless 
a hundred meters away, drifted 
ghost-like back into the woods. He 
frowned after it. Who, he wondered, 
was really doing the hunting here? 
How much communication did these 
beasts have? Could the cat report? 
He pushed aside his brush barricade. 
Now, at daybreak, the birds made 
an early warning system. He picked 
a spot in the open, by the stream, 
and breakfasted out of a can, shar- 
ing the last of it with something 
small and furry which came, nose 
twitching, from its own rocky shel- 
ter. 

He moved on south, keeping in 
the open when possible, until he 
guessed he was within half a kilo- 
meter of the hunter’s rocky knoll. 
There was a whisper of movement 
in the undergrowth. Once he heard 
the chilling scream of a cat. Then a 
crashing in the woods behind him 
whirled him around, keyed for trou- 
ble. Trouble was shaping. One of the 
rhinhorses was coming toward him 
through the trees. Joe was astonished 
to see the charging beast was ignor- 
ing a dart tree which stood in its 
path. The beast thundered closely 
past the tree trunk and the branches 
lashed violently. Then he realized 
that with* its head low, to protect 
its eyes, the big beast was imper- 
vious. The needles would simply 
glance from that armored back. 

He brought up the laser, then 
swore under his breath, realizing al- 
most too late that this attack was 



loo obvious, too blatantly a diver- 
sion. He wheeled around, gambling 
on a quick estimate that anything 
so ponderous could not possibly turn 
as quickly as he could jump from 
its path. He burned down one leap- 
ing cat in mid air, disabled another 
as it raced in from the side. Then 
he leaped, sprawling, from the thun- 
der of pounding feet behind him. 
The rhinhorse crashed past, wheez- 
ing, but looking neither right nor 
left. Joe came to his feet in time to 
see a third cat fade into the under- 
brush up the slope ahead. 

He waited, ready for another 
move, but none came. He was keen- 
ly alert now, convinced finally that 
he had not overrated his adversary. 
The hunter was something more than 
just a crafty ape. This last move was 
something Joe himself might have 
tried had he been directing the same 
“weapons” the hunter was using. 

He moved on, alert but thinking 
hard. Was he being stupid about this? 
After all, five or six days and the E- 
Ship would be back with help. He 
shook off the thought. This was, now 
more than ever, a personal duel be- 
tween himself and that quickly 
glimpsed flying ape with its wide, 
fur covered membranes and man-like 
head. He thought for a moment. 
What if their positions were revers- 
ed? What would he, Joe, do if he 
were in the hunter’s place? First he 
would try to influence this strange 
new being, try driving thoughts at 
him, try to make him do what he 
wanted, go where he wanted. 

Joe halted wdth a start. Was he 
being influenced? Was he being led, 
or driven, into some kind of trap? 



68 



IF 




He thought not. Certainly he had re- 
acted properly a few moments back. 
He mov^ again, still wondering. 
Then he realized the question was 
academic. It no longer mattered 
whether he had been led into a trap 
or had walked into it by chance. 
He was in it, and it was closing 
around him. He had come to the 
foot of the high, rocky prominence 
which the viewers in the comsats had 
shown to be the hunter’s lair. This 
approach was bordered with dart 
trees, big ones, which overlapped, 
with no way out between them. And 
behind him again was the restless, 
prowling ring of cats and lesser quad- 
rupeds, cutting off retreat. They 
could overrun him any time they 
were ordered to! 

H e didn’t wait. He slipped the 
pack from his back and, run- 
ning, threw a barrage of explosions 
from the hand gun into the woods 
and followed his barrage back to the 
edge of the trees to a rocky out- 
cropping. A big dart tree, with 
smaller trees of other kinds nearby, 
protected him from one side. From 
the other, the cats could get at him 
only two or three at a time. It was 
at best a reprieve. But it would buy 
him some time. 

He crouched by the rocks, breath- 
ing hard, and grew tense as he real- 
ized that time itself could beat him. 
The hunter could wait him out if it 
came to a stalemate. And it looked 
as if some of the cats were getting 
ready for a rush at the open corri- 
dor leading in to him. He recalled 
their confused behavior the day be- 
fore when the hunter’s attention had 



been diverted. Apparently there was 
a limit to his ability to control and 
direct. Joe watched the cats, and the 
movements in the woods which indi- 
cated others were collecting. It’s 
worth a try, he thought, and turned 
the laser on one of the big, rocky 
outcroppings at the top of the knoll. 

The rock smoked and chipped, 
dust and vapor rising as the beam cut 
into it. He judged the hunter’s con- 
fusion by the sudden disruption 
among the cats. Some retreated, 
others merely stopped, crouched and 
snarling. But the rush which had 
been shaping was broken up. 

But this, too, was a losing tactic. 
There wasn’t energy enough in the 
laser’s power pack to destroy that 
rocky outcropping which protected 
the hunter. Joe studied the rocky 
knoll, estimating heights and dis- 
tances, and glanced up at the dart 
tree which, at one side of him, was 
both a shield and a barrier. This 
tree, too, towered. And from its 
upper branches he believed he could 
see over the hunter’s barricade. 

He fired more pellets into the 
woods around him, sent several, for 
effect, against the still smoking rocks 
at the top of the hill. Then he made 
a quick estimate of height and dis- 
tance and turned the laser against 
a smaller tree growing outside the 
dart tree’s circle of sensitive roots. 
He cut out a wedge low in the trunk 
and the tree slowly toppled, crashed 
through the dart tree’s lower branch- 
es, and fell heavily across the root 
system, its upper tip well inside the 
dart tree’s inner circle. The dart tree 
lashed in blind frenzy, but when the 
pressure stabilized the dart-tipped

limbs straightened, inert. Joe flipped 
down his helmet, chose a pathway 
through the upright branches of the 
felled tree, and raced across his 
bridge to the safe area in close to 
the dart tree’s trunk. He jumped, 
caught a handhold, and climbed. Be- 
low him the cats converged, raging, 
ringing the tree. 

J oe climbed, watching for a 
glimpse of the hunter. Once he 
glanced down and smiled grimly. 

The hunter could see him. Two 
of the cats were making their way 
across his tree trunk bridge below, 
on their way up after him. For the 
moment he ignored them, watching 
the knoll as he climbed higher. Be- 
low him the cats gained. It was only 
a distraction, but it was a good one, 
for soon he would have to dispose of 
them. 

He could see the far side of the 
hunter’s knoll before he could see 
into the fort-like formation where 
the hunter must be hiding. The far 
side, too, had its share of dart trees, 
but these were widely spaced. There 
were rocks on the far side also, big 
outcroppings between which the 
hunter could dodge if he chose to 
retreat. One of the rhinhorses was 
there, too, glimpsed as it made its 
way up the far side between the 
rocks. 

Joe could hear the cats snarling 
behind him. Soon he would have to 
turn away and dispose of them. 
Then, below him on the knoll, the 
big rhinhorse crossed an open area 
and Joe caught a glimpse of the 
brown, ape-like shape of the hunter 
as he leaped for the rhinhorse’s 



lowered neck. The hunter scrambled 
up and the big animal burst into the 
open, heading away, toward an open- 
ing in the trees. Joe braced himself, 
ignored the cats and drew a bead on 
the rider. 

It was a long shot, at a moving 
target. But when the laser hissed 
Joe saw the rider jerk, sway and 
clasp one hand against his shoulder. 
Then the rider slumped forward, 
face down, clinging to the rhinhorse’s 
neck. The rhinhorse slowed its pace, 
nearly stopped, and presently trot- 
ted on aimlessly, changing course. 

Joe glanced down. The cats were 
close, too close, but no longer con- 
trolled. One was retreating, backing 
gingerly down the tree trunk. The 
other was still climbing, looking 
about as if dazed but still coming — 
probably now, he thought, of its own 
killer’s volition. Joe coldly shot it 
out of the tree and then turned back 
to the hunter. 

He was still clinging to his mount, 
but apparently no longer able to 
guide it. And because of that he was 
doomed. For the rhinhorse, having 
no fear of the dart tree needles, was 
wandering away from the opening 
toward which the hunter had guided 
it. It was on a course which would 
take it between two big, closely 
placed trees which would sweep the 
wounded hunter from its back. 

Again Joe lifted the rifle, aiming 
carefully. The beam hissed, smoking, 
into the ground at one side of the 
trotting rhinhorse. The animal start- 
ed and jerked away, nearly unseating 
the clinging rider. Joe sent another 
beam after the first, close in, and 
the ground smoked and blackened 



70 



IF 




as the heat bit into it. This time the 
animal turned aside and trotted safe- 
ly past the trees on open ground. 

Joe dropped his faceplate and 
watched at high magnification. As 
the rhinhorse cleared the trees Joe 
saw the rider struggle upright, look- 
ing back. It was Joe’s first close look 
at his adversary, and he wasn’t pret- 
ty, that was certain. But neither was 
he a beetle-browed ape. Inside that 
homely, fur-covered head was a skull 
of a size and shape to hold as good 
a brain as a dolphin’s — or a man’s. 
And, looking back, the hunter did 
something which made Joe nod and 
smile thoughtfully. 

True, the hunter was swaying, 
barely able to keep his seat. And he 
could have been only reaching for 
his burned shoulder. But Joe didn’t 
think so. Joe was virtually certain 
that weakly, but definitely, the hunt- 
er raised his hand. 

Joe raised his own hand, empty, 
palm forward. The hunter turned 
away, swaying but holding his seat. 

V 

J oe was back in his meadow, fish- 
ing, when the landing boat came 
in with the rest of the K-III team. 
This gne settled like a leaf. 

Joe chuckled to himself at his im- 
age of the boys in Maintenance ag- 
onizing over its performance. Joe had 
found the wreck of his own boat. It 
was mostly scrap, but with some 
computer components still usable, 
and his own p<^ communicator, he 
had jury-rigged a gadget with which 
Albert, with Slim Holman’s help, had 
analyzed the creek water, some of 



the game, and a whopping, flopping 
gilled thing from the stream, finding 
them all usable. Joe had been living 
high — ha,d, in fact, been living it up, 
with nothing to do but fish and hunt. 

Holman came in with them. She 
left the group by the boat and ap- 
proached, slim and lithe, skirting the 
dead dart tree with distaste. Joe 
watched with appreciation. She would 
do to have along. She was the only 
woman he had ever seen who could 
make those issue coveralls look as 
if they had been tailored. He cocked 
an eyebrow. Come to think of it, 
maybe they had been tailored, by 
her. She smiled a greeting. 

“The Chief was right. I might 
have known you’d be off fishing 
when there’s work to do.” 

After that she talked only shop, 
until as they walked back along the 
creek, her eyes began to dance. 

“And right over there,” she point- 
ed — “is your swimming hole.” 

Joe felt his ears burning. “Slim! I 
wouldn’t have thought it of you! Just 
how long were you back in visual 
contact before I knew it?” 

She laughed. “I’ll never tell you, 
pioneer.” 

Joe laughed too, but then he sob- 
ered and looked away, around the 
meadow, at the green forest glade 
that stretched away unbroken and 
unscarred. He turned back to the 
girl. “I’ll tell you something. Slim. 
One day that is going to be a swim- 
ming hole, a real one. I’m going to 
build my dam right across here.” 

She looked up at him, wide eyed. 
“What are you talking about.” 

“Me. I’ve found it. This is home 
Slim.”

“You mean you’re going to stay 
here? You can’t!” 

“No, not now. But I’m coming 
back here. I’m something of a ward- 
room space lawyer, Slim. I’ve read 
the fine print in my contract. There 
is a paragraph most of these guys 
skip over — but it’s the paragraph 
which brought me into the service 
to begin with. When your term is 
up you get a bonus, a good one. 
Most of the boys don’t read past 
that point. They just start spending 
the money. But you can, if you 
choose, take land instead of cash. 
And this — ” he waved expansively 
— “is going to be my bonus. As 
much land here on III as I can talk 
them out of. I’m going to be the first 
colonist here, and I’m going to have 
plenty to say about the way this little 
world is used.” 

“But the hunter, Joe. The one 
you drove away, and the others like 
him.” 

“I can cope with them. I’m learn- 
ing more about them every day, and 
they’re learning about me. But look. 
Slim. As you say, there’s work to 
do now. But this little world has the 
darnedest moon you ever saw. Twice 
as bright as Luna. Walk out here 
with me tonight and I’ll bring you 
up to date about Joe Hanley. I can 
tell you things about him that even 
Albert doesn’t know.” 

It was. her turn to blush. “Joe 
Hanley, I’ve never asked Albert any- 
thing about you! Why . .” 

He laughed and took her arm. 
“Come on, there’s work to do. The 
Thorn will want a report, and I 
want to get this decision of mine on 
the record.” 



T hat evening Ill’s moon turned 
out to be everything Joe had 
predicted. The meadow was silent 
and glowing. They walked slowly, 
taking in the moonlit landscape. But 
when they approached the stream 
they heard a sudden sound nearby, a 
sighing, grunting wheeze. 

Joe froze for an instant, then drew 
his hand gun and stepped in front 
of the girl. She said nothing, but she 
just as quickly moved up beside him 
again, her own gun out, waist high. 
Joe noted with approval that she 
handled it as if she knew what it 
was, but he ordered, “Get back!” 
“No! I can use this thing if need 
be, remember? What is it?” 

He put a hand on her wrist. 
“Don’t move, then, unless I do. It’s 
a cat, and with them you take noth- 
ing for granted.” 

Then they saw it approaching, 
slowly, half crouched, moving with 
the loose, flowing gait common to 
predators. Ghostly moonlight glint- 
ed in its eyes. The girl caught her 
breath. 

“It’s . it’s carrying something!” 
Almost at their feet the cat put 
down its burden. For an instant it 
glared at them, fangs gleaming 
whitely. Joe watched tensely, and he 
could sense the girl at his side fight- 
ing to keep under control. Joe felt — 
something — touch his mind, a prob- 
ing that somehow could get through 
to him. For the tiniest fraction of 
an instant he felt — well, reassured. 
Then the feeling was gone. 

But the hunter was nearby. Joe 
could almost see the cat’s killer urge 
being stifled, suppressed, the lean 
body frozen almost rigid. Then with 



72 



IF 




a rasping snarl the cat turned away. 
In seconds its loose, flowing run car- 
ried it into the shadows. 

“Joe! What does it mean. I felt 
something . .” 

“I think I know. This is the third 
time, and one of those predators 
would never do a thing like that 
on its own.” 

The girl looked around at the sur- 
rounding woods and shivered. “Then 
the hunter sent it!” 

“Yes. That thing the cat brought 
is the K-III equivalent of a rainbow 
trout. I imagine that to the hunter 
it is a delicacy. It’s a gift — a kind 
of Peace offering. It means we can 
come to terms with him.” 

“But he’s a killer!” 

“No, he’s a hunter. That’s a dis- 
tinction lost on most people. The cats 
are killers. But uncontrolled they’re 
no worse than any other predator. 
They can be handled. But I believe 
I can make friends with the hunter. 
Who knows? Maybe I can teach him 
to use tools, and he can teach me 
to use my mind.” 

The sighing wheeze sounded again. 
This time the shrubbery parted, and 
an ugly, horse-faced head, jaws mov- 
ing rhythmically, pushed into view. 
The girl started, and took Joe’s arm. 
Joe laughed. “It’s only George.” 

She looked up. “\^y, that’s how 
. he’s what we heard, before the 
cat came.” 

“Yes. I found him trying to roll 
in the sand one day, and gimmicked 
the laser to burn the moss off his 
back. Since then he’s appointed me 



his groom and himself my body- 
guard.” 

T he girl released his arm and 
glanced around. The park-like 
glade was shimmering in the fluor- 
escence of Ill’s enormous moon. 
And that, Joe thought, was some- 
thing else he liked about thfs new 
world. In this moonlight her eyes 
and her smile didn’t seem cool, as 
they usually did. And when she 
spoke, her voice was warm, pitched 
low. 

She said, “Joe, I lied, to you this 
morning. Only a little, though, be- 
cause this morning I really hadn’t 
talked to Albert about you, much. 
But this afternoon I did. After feed- 
ing him the data on what you told 
me this morning, and after telling 
him I like this new world of yours 
too.” 

Joe laughed. “You believe every- 
thing that outsize calculator tells 
you?^’ 

“Yes. He doesn’t know how to 
lie. And when I said I was going to 
tell you all this he predicted — 
ninety-nine point eight probability 
— what you’re going to say next.” 
Joe looked down at her, but before 
he could speak she put a slim hand 
momentarily to his lips. Then she 
reached out and patted the rhin- 
horse’s ugly, armored nose. 

“Just for tonight, Georgie,” she 
whispered, “go do your bodyguard- 
ing from over there by the stream 
someplace. I know what I’m going 
to say next, too.” END

IF ^ Short Story 




by CAROL EASTON 



Dreams were the stuff the 
world was built on — then 
one day the dreams stopped! 



T he day they nationalized the 
Dream Machine Corporation 
was the day Harry Carver dreamed 
himself to death. On that last day, 
in his confusion and despair, there 
was simply no choice. The principles 
on which he had built his life — and 
by this time his life and the dream 
machines had become indistinguish- 
able, one from the other — seemed 
a mockery, a colossal practical joke 
with Harry Carver both the perpe- 
trator and the target. 

The machine was to have been 
Harry’s gift to the world — his pan- 
acea for the emotionally lame, halt 
and blind. A solution to humanity’s 
hitherto insoluble problems. Those 
unhappy individuals for whom "self- 
acceptance was unattainable, if not 
incomprehensible, would at last be 



able to derive happiness and satis- 
faction from their lives. Frustration 
would become as extinct as, say, 
smallpox. Men would live in har- 
mony with their fellow men; wars 
would become ancient history, and 
the tools of war, nuclear stockpiles 
and all, museum relics. No one 
would be dissatisfied with his lot, for 
it would be the one he had freely 
chosen, and which he could ex- 
change for another at any time. 

For financial and other practical 
reasons, the Dream Machine Cor- 
poration had been founded in Har- 
ry’s garage. 

The first machine was bulky, 
noisy and far from esthetic — in fact, 
it was encased in an old, discarded 
telephone booth. Experimentation 
with animals being impossible, Harry 



74 




had searched long and hard for a 
subject. At last he had settled on the 
unhappiest human being he knew: 
his father-in-law. Joe Stoddard had 
lived a full and happy life, but since 
his wife’s death fifteen years ago, 
his genial disposition had deterior- 
ated into an almost catatonic state. 
Loneliness had overwhelmed him; he 
had lost his taste for living, neither 
had he sufficient motivation for dy- 
ing. The contrast between his present 
and former selves was heartbreak- 
ing for Harry to watch, and his 
father-in-law had been in the back 
of his mind all the while he was con- 
structing the machine. So Joe Stod- 
dard was the logical choice for the 
machine’s trial run. 

J oe had sat quietly, eyes closed, in 
the converted phone booth 
while Harry programmed the ma- 
chine with the information Joe had 
given him. 

Slowly the muscles of Joe’s face 
relaxed into a smile. Within a few 
minutes he looked twenty years 
younger, and the deeply-etched lines 
around his mouth seemed almost to 
disappear. An expression of pure joy 
fixed itself on his face, and Harry’s 
eyes never left that face during the 
four hours until the machine auto- 
matically switched itself off. Joe 
Stoddard yawned, stretched himself 
and looked at Harry, his eyes shin- 
ing with a light that had flickered 
out fifteen years ago. “God bless 
you,” he murmured to Harry. “It’s 
a miracle. I just dreamed my honey- 
moon all over again — only it was 
more real than any dream I’ve ever 
had. It was realer than — realer than 



real, is what I’d call it. I could smell 
Louise’s perfume, and feel the soft- 
ness of her skin. Really feel it! I 
don’t know if it’s hypnotism or hallu- 
cination or what, but, Harry — it 
was more real than anything I’ve 
ever experienced. Likelife, but larg- 
er than life!” 

Thus the first testimonial for the 
dream machine. 

Due to the inordinate amount of 
time required to program the ma- 
chine, Harry found it necessary to 
hire a staff, small to begin with, to 
assist him. And in order to meet 
his payroll, he found it necessary to 
rent, quietly and on a private basis, 
a few of the first experimental ma- 
chines. 

At first the price was exorbitant; 
but Harry made those early sales to 
people whose pleasure it is to buy 
what no one else can afford. Each 
dream was personalized and orig- 
inal, and this naturally kept the 
price up. Later, Harry thought, basic 
dreams could be mass-produced on 
a much lower cost-per-dream basis. 
And so, within just a few months, 
the dream machines became .ac- 
knowledged status symbols. 

Word-of-mouth advertising flour- 
ished, and Harry finally resorted to 
buying advertising time and space, 
not to sell more machines, for from 
the beginning the demand exceeded 
the supply, but to educate the pub- 
lic to dispel the rumors that seemed 
to multiply daily. The most com- 
mon misconception was that the 
dream machines were a new en- 
tertainment medium, a sort of elab- 
orate, three-dimensional personal 
television set. The public couldn’t

75 




seem to believe that anything as in- 
timate, as individual as a dream, 
could be manufactured. But it was 
something new, they admitted, and 
that fact alone guaranteed its suc- 
cess on the market. The first Christ- 
mas after Harry had gotten his fac- 
tory going on a full-time basis, ev- 
eryone who already had a portable 
hair dryer, electric can opener, elec- 
tric carving knife, not to mention 
color TV — in short, most of the 
population received gift certificates 
for dream machines. They had only 
to fill out the elaborate order 
blanks and drop them in the mail, 
and within three months the dream 
machine of their choice would be 
delivered, installed and demonstrat- 
ed for them. 

B y this time, those certain basic 
categories Harry had anticipat- 
ed were taking shape. 

By far the greatest demand was 
for the Little Girl/Boy Dream. 
Mothers wanted it, and fathers — 
particularly analysands. Senior citi- 
zens ordered them and even oc- 
casionally teenagers. To be a child 
again — this was the dream of 
dreams. Rare was the adult, how- 
ever, who chose to dream his own 
childhood. Of all the dreams, the 
Childhood Dreams were farthest 
from reality. But still, as Joe Stod- 
dard had put it, “realer than real”. 

Each, week’s national “Top Ten 
Dreams” became the basis of the 
new psychiatry. The Elizabeth Tay- 
lor Dream was a favorite with the 
housewives, and its counterpart with 
their husbands. Conservatives or- 
dered variations of the Dictator 



Dream, available in various histor- 
ical settings (the Christians-to-the 
Lions Dream was a heavy seller). 
Liberals, on the other hand, quickly 
bought out the Saint Dreams, from 
Aquinas to Xavier. Harry had ex- 
pected these to be big sellers with 
the clergy, but they leaned almost to 
a body to the Fetish Dreams, Ant- 
eaters through Zoos. All orders 
were, under strictest security meas- 
ures, kept confidential. Executives 
ordered Walden Dreams, and farm- 
ers ordered Playboy Dreams. Con- 
firmed drug and alcohol addicts 
kicked their habits with ease while 
dreaming Don Juan and other Con- 
quest Dreams. Politicians favored 
the Coronation Dream, and military 
men dreamed, almost without excep- 
tion, of Mom. 

There were categories within cat- 
egories of dreams, the basic ones 
being sexual, financial and spirit- 
ual. Each dreamer was guaranteed 
that it was impossible for him to 
dream exactly the same dream 
twice; although the emotional exper- 
ience desired by the dreamer never 
varied, nor did the main characters, 
the plot twists, costumes and set- 
tings brought an element of sus- 
pense to each dream, thus heighten- 
ing the final satisfaction. The 
dreams were the ultimate escape. 

Yet, unlike other escapees, they 
were always fresh, available at will 
(after the initial expense) and com- 
pletely safe. Television, movies, 
comic books and sports events be- 
came obsolete. The dreams eclipsed 
all other, less convincing, diversions. 
The population was truly at peace 
with itself; divorce, crime, conflict

IF 




of any kind simply ceased to be. 
People went to work each morning 
blissful and highly motivated by the 
previous night’s dream, and worked 
feverishly through the day to get 
home to their dream machines. 

B y the second anniversary of the 
formation of the Dream Ma- 
chine Corporation, disturbing doubts 
had begun to take shape in Harry 
Carver’s mind. 

He had designed the machines to 
comfort the afflicted, never dream- 
ing that the term encompassed the 
entire population. It seemed to 
Harry that he alone, in all the 
dreaming country, had no compal- 
sion to dream. Even those of his 
friends whom he had considered 
most happy, best- adjusted, dreamed 
themselves to sleep each night. His 
own wife, Marian, had requested 
and received a custom streamlined 
dream machine, programmed to her 
college days. It wasn’t, she assured 
Harry, that she was dissatisfied with 
her life with him. It was just — ^well, 
she really couldn’t explain it, but 
she just couldn’t give up that year 
of her life when she was runner-up 
to the Homecoming Queen. (Only 
in her dream, of course, she wasn’t 
runner-up.) 

Harry found it lonely evenings 
while Marian dreamed, so for some- 
thing to do, he programmed him- 
self a James Bond dream. He had 
been working fifteen hours a day, 
seven days a week, trying to fill the 
back orders that overflowed his of- 
fices. And after all, a man was en- 
titled to some relaxation. It was his 
only luxury, if indeed it could be 



considered a luxury. For awhile, life 
was good. But then Harry began to 
wonder, can life be too good? 

He had observed the symptoms 
first in his father-in-law, who by 
now had probably logged the most 
dreaming hours in the country. 

At first, the dreams had motivat- 
ed him to be more productive, more 
sociable, more aware than ever in 
his life. But little by little, Joe Stod- 
dard seemed to become — there was 
only one word for it, Harry decided 
— dreamlike. There were moments, 
and they grew alarmingly more fre- 
quentj when Joe’s face would, with- 
out warning, begin to blur around 
the edges, becoming more and more 
indistinct until — Harry would rub 
his eyes, blink and squint, but there 
was no doubt about it — it would 
disappear altogether, sometimes 
leaving empty space, sometimes to 
be replaced by other faces mouthing 
senseless, disjointed words. 

This unnerved Harry to the ex- 
tent that he sought to lose himself 
in his work as never before. The 
possible explanations for Joe’s be- 
havior were far too frightening for 
Harry to contemplate. 

And, at first, his work succeeded 
in keeping his mind occupied. But 
as the weeks passed, the work be- 
came monotonous; the novelty of it 
had worn thin, and the routine of 
it became, for Harry, deadly dull. 
He found himself looking forward 
with ever-growing anticipation to his 
nightly 007 dreams, infinite in their 
variations, predictable in style but 
never in detail. He installed a dup- 
licate of his personal machine in his 
office, for use during his dream 



THE DREAM MACHINE

breaks. He often spent the night now 
on the couch in the office lounge, 
knowing Marian, absorbed in her 
own dreams, wouldn’t notice his ab- 
sence. Besides, his behavior was per- 
fectly normal. Everyone spent the 
greatest part of his time dreaming 
now; people stayed more and more 
within their dream machines, se- 
cure, safe and contented, often for- 
getting to eat or sleep — forgetting, 
in fact, to wake up. 

T he last session of the Congress 
of the United States — the last 
session, that is, where enough mem- 
bers were awake to constitute a 
quorum — ^had less the appearance 
of a legislative session than a 
shadow play. 

Voices rose and fell with a hyp- 
notic harmoniousness, and every bill 
introduced was passed unanimously; 
for the first time in the history of 
any nation, opposing parties ceased 
to attack each other. The final bill, 
sponsored by the leaders of both 
parties, proposed that in the inter- 
ests of national security, national 
defense, farm price supports, foreign 
aid, stable currency, management 
and labor, civil rights. The Bill of 
Rights, the CIA, the FCC, the DAR, 
SEATO, NATO and the Armed 
Forces Radio Service, the Dream 
Machine Corporation would hence 
forth become a public utility, owned 
and operated by the United States 
government. The motion was carried 
by a voice vote, and when Harry 
Carver could not be reached by 
telephone, a telegram was sent to 
inform him of the new legislation. 
When the Western Union messen- 



ger interrupted Harry at the climax 
of a dream, Harry was appalled at 
the seriousness of the situation. Any 
government with the power to con- 
trol its citizens’ dreams could — 
Harry shuddered at the implications. 
Surely, he thought, it must be a mis- 
take! Didn’t they realize, couldn’t 
they see where this sort of thing 
must lead? He, Agent 007, would 
have to tell them — 

No, that was wrong! He splashed 
his face with ice water, trying to 
jolt his drowsy brain to full aware- 
ness. He was Harry Carver, of 
course, and he would appear before 
a Joint Session of Congress, if nec- 
essary, and show them just how mis- 
guided, how fuzzy their thinking had 
become! 

The first thing to do, he thought, 
was to contact some influential leg- 
islators and sound them out before 
making any public statement. He 
dialed direct to Washington, but the 
phones rang in empty offices. Fran- 
tic, he tried to c^l an emergency 
meeting of his Board of Directors — 
but their telephones were all off the 
hook. Harry, by a supreme effort of 
will, forced himself to concentrate. 
It was an almost impossible task. 
The papers, he thought, what do the 
morning papers say?' Pehaps there 
he might find a clue to help form- 
ulate his course of action. He went 
out into the empty streets, looking 
for a newspaper to tell him what 
was happening in the nation whose 
problems he, Harry, had single- 
handedly eliminated. 

But the newsstands were covered 
with dust and rust, and the papers 
on them were yellowed and fading.

IF 




H arry strained to focus his eyes, 
and found himself alone in a 
land of changing shapes and shad- 
ows. Buildings floated through the 
mists, their forms constantly chang- 
ing. Harry felt himself surrounded 
by spectral giants, menacing despite, 
or perhaps because of, their un- 
substantiality. He was seized by an 
uncontrollable panic. He tried to 
run, exerting every muscle, but he 
had the sensation of walking under 
water. Somethingy some nameless, 
faceless thing was after him. Sud- 
denly a wave of relief washed over 
him. Directly in front of him, sent 
by some merciful Providence, stood 
his own monogrammed dream ma- 
chine, familiar and safe in a world 
of terror. He dropped gratefully into 
its reclining massage chair — the 
newer models were greatly refined 
— and pressed the “Dream” button. 

For one moment, all was as it had 
been, and Harry began to relax. He 
was suave and supremely confident 
in his evening clothes, surrounded 



by a voluptuous harem. But no — 
something was wrong! He was Harry 
Carver again, and this time sur- 
rounded by immense, roaring prehis- 
toric monsters breathing fire! 

No sooner had he grasped the im- 
age than it changed, then changed 
again, and again. He was encircled 
by a montage of storms, volcanic 
eruptions, giant insects, animals of 
every description, earthquakes, and 
grotesque, misshapen faces — and 
they were all, every one of them, 
after him. His mouth felt parched, 
his tongue thick. He tried to scream, 
but only soft whimpers came from 
his throat. He could feel the phys- 
ical presence of the nightmare now, 
crushing his body and freezing his 
brain. He was falling — a void had 
opened beneath him and he was 
spinning and whirling, ever faster, 
no control nOw, consciousness dis- 
solving into the silence of a star, 
broken only by echoes of alarm 
clocks, ringing unheeded in empty 
rooms. END

IF • Novelette 



Sweet Reason 

by CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 



Illustrated by MODEL 



Here's how the failed Cenfrans 
handle goof-offs. It'd never 
work with humans . would it? 



I 

^aptain Karp Moklin, Centran 
^ assistant psychologist at the 
local prisoner-detention camp, nod- 
ded to the perspiring Earth psy- 
chotherapist who was his visitor. 

“Yes, Dr. Garvin. As you say, 
such cases as these are for the 
spWalists.” 

Garvin drew a shaky breath. “I 
certainly do feel privileged. Cap- 
tain, to come and watch a Centran 
psychologist at work. Fm very 



anxious to meet Major Poffis. My 
own — ah — efforts certainly don’t 
seem to have accomplished much.” 

In the cell behind him stood a 
large Centran soldier, his fur un- 
brushed and untrimmed, tail thrash- 
ing in triumph, a sneer on his face, 
and a chunk of Dr. Garvin’s sport 
jacket in his hand. 

“Of course,” said Garvin, “really 
deep psychotherapy is a very slow 
process. This is why I am so 
an^ous to see one of your own 
people, and observe his methods. 



80 





Possibly if we could — ah — pool 
our resources it might be possible 
to considerably accelerate the course 
of treatment.” 

Moklin nodded. “Major Poffis 
himself has often complained that 
the work takes too long.” 

“Is the — ah — the incidence of 
relapses — ” Garvin hesitated, then 
rephrased the question to fit the less 
developed Centran mentality. “I 
mean, do the patients have to come 
back very often for a second course 
of treatments?” 

The Centran seemed startled at 
this idea. “No, of course not.” 
“The treatments are usually sue- 
cessfulT' 

“Oh, yes.” 

“Does the major also treat those 
suffering from — ah — battle fa- 
tigue — ” 

The Centran looked puzzled. 
“Everyone is fatigued in battle. No, 
the major’s treatment is not meant 
for that. He handles mostly these 
uncontrollables, the ones with — ” 
“Severe neuroses?” 

“With the — ah — with the vio- 
lent — ah — ” Moklin paused as 
if mentally searching for some word 
or phrase that he had memorized 
onr^ with the intention of using it 
later for effect. He straightened, 
and said learnedly, “With the ‘vio- 
lent antisocial tendencies.’ ” 

Garvin blinked. “This is Major 
Poffis’s specialty, then?” 

“Yes,” said Captain Moklin. “He 
does a lot of this work.” 

“That is precisely what we find 
most difficult.” Garvin glanced un- 
easily at the prisoner, who with coy 
gestures was now urging him to 



come closer to the bars. “We find,” 
liC coughed slightly, “that these are 
often the most obstinate cases. They 
are difficult to reach — to contact 
— to form any common — ” 

The captain glanced at the wall 
clock. 

“Major Poffis can reach theifo. He 
will be here soon. He is always on 
time. Then you will iee how he 
does it.” 

The prisoner methodically tore his 
piece of Garvin’s jacket to shreds, 
and leered at Garvin through the 
bars. 

T he clang of an outer door and 
the sound of voices heralded 
the arrival of Major Poffis. 

Dr. Garvin said anxiously, “Is 
the major, ah, quite high in your 
academic hierarchy? In civilian life, 
I mean.” 

The Centran captain looked 
blank. “He has a Qh.Q.” 

“Ah, I see. Of course. Well — I’m 
not really familiar with the niceties 
of Centran — ah — academic pro- 
tocol. Shall I call him ‘major,’ or 
‘doctor’?” 

The Centran looked blank. “He 
is a major.” 

Garvin had the sensation of com- 
ing solidly up against a blank wall. 
He nodded hastily, and barely 
stopped himself from saying, “Silly 
of me to ask.” Such comments, he 
had found, were likely to cause the 
Centrans to agree. Instead, he pre- 
pared himself to greet the Centran 
academic. 

From the man’s record of cures, 
he was a veritable master psychol- 
ogist. Some of Garvin’s colleagues. 



SWEET REASON 



81 




of course, did not consider the 
record of cures really significant. 
For them what counted were the 
methods used and the theoretical 
justification of the methods. But 
Garvin personally found it a little 
embarassing to do no better than 
unaided nature. From Major Poffis 
— in his mind he decided to call 
him Dr. Poffis — from Dr. Poffis 
he would learn the best of Centran 
practices, then combine it with the 
highest Earth theory, and perhaps 
thus create a universal treatment 
superior to any hitherto used. 

A murmur just outside the door 
told of Dr. Poffis’s approach. 

Garvin prepared his smile and 
readied the comment, “I hope that 
a useful cross-fertilization of our 
mutual concepts may bear fruit in 
a more successful treatment. Doc- 
tor.” Just where he would put this 
into the conversation, Garvin wasn’t 
sure, but he wanted it ready when 
the time came. 

The door latch clicked, and Gar- 
vin extended his right hand. He was 
on the alert to approach the tall 
distinguished Centran who would 
come in, who would perhaps be im- 
pressively silver-furred, with a slight- 
ly wry smile, or perhaps with a look 
of blazing incandescent genius de- 
manding the instant submission of 
lesser intellects, and — 

The door opened. A Centran ma- 
jor of above average height, broad- 
ly built, with muscles up both sides 
of his neck under the fur, walked 
in and growled, “All right, Moklin, 
what’s on the sheet for today?” 

Captain Moklin bawled, “Atten- 
tionV" 



The prisoner raised his right hand 
to his forehead, as if in salute. Then 
he lowered the thumb and forefinger 
to the sides of his nose and blew 
out hard. In case the idea didn’t 
get across, he spat through the bars 
onto the major’s tunic. 

The major showed no sign of 
noticing anything unusual. “At ease. 
What do we have today, Moklin?” 

“This is the first one, sir, in the 
cell right here.” 

The major nodded, started to 
speak, then frowned at Garvin. Gar- 
vin had his phrases all set, and 
now heard himself say stupidly, 
“How do you do? I am Dr. Gar- 
vin from Rolling Hills Rest and Re- 
habilitation Center. I — er — had 
hoped that a — ah — a useful cross- 
fertilization of our — ah — mut- 
ual — ” 

M ajor Poffis took a closer look 
at Garvin. 

Garvin paused, groping around 
for some way to give a more con- 
ventional ending to this opening 
gambit. 

Poffis glanced at the captain. “Is 
this a patient?” 

“No sir. This is the Earth psy- 
chologist from Mental Institution 
16 .” 

Garvin cleared his throat, and said 
gently but firmly, “We find it more 
appropriate to designate it ‘Rollin<2 
Hills Rest and — ’ ” 

Poffis looked him over coldly. 
“What the devil’s the matter wi'h 
them out there?” 

Garvin looked blank. “What?” 
Poffis said shortly. “Why don’t 
they get their thumb out of their 



82 



IF 




mouths and give us some action? 
I sent half-a-dozen cases of com- 
bat nerves in six months ago, and 
so far we’ve gotten just one back. 
The boy was worthless. What the 
devil do you do to your patients?” 
He turned to Captain Moklin. “I 
notice this fellow has a chunk out 
of his jacket. Has he been adminis- 
tering treatment in my absence?** 

“Not actually, sir. He just walked 
over and tried to reason with the 
patient, that’s all.” 

Poffis looked mollified. “That 
shouldn’t do much harm.” He 
glanced at the cell. “Now then, this 
fellow hasn’t been in combat yet, 
has he?” 

“No, sir. He isn’t out of train- 
ing yet.” 

“You’re sure we’ve got the right 
recordsl This isn’t a damned ad- 
ministrative bungle like that last 
mess?” 

“No, sir,” said Moklin grimly. 
“I checked that myself, sir. This 
is the right man, all right.” 

“What’s the recommendation?” 

“Court recommended death. Pa- 
tient’s commanding officer pleaded 
for leniency.” 

The patient laughed out loud, as 
if witnessing a peculiarly silly scene 
in a play. 

Major Poffis looked the patient 
over appraisingly, then glanced at 
Moklin. “On what grounds did his 
commanding officer plead for len- 
iency?” 

“He thought the fellow could be 
made into a good soldier, sir. With 
the proper treatment.” 

Poffis scowled. “Yes, there’s that 
again. What’s on the sheet, Mok- 



lin? How many of these cases have 
we got for today?” 

Moklin looked apK)logetic. “Three 
more for this morning, sir. Now, 
about this prisoner — ” 

Poffis stared at him. “And this 
afternoon?” 

“Sir?” 

*'How many this afternoon?” 
“We’ve got — that is — ” Mok- 
lin swallowed. “Sir, there are six of 
them.” 

Poffis’s brows came together. 
‘That’s too many. Put some of 
them over till tomorrow.” 

“Well, sir, tomorrow — ” 

Poffis snarled, “It takes time to 
get a cure started. I’ll handle three 
this morning, and three this after- 
noon. From there, it’s routine. But 
I’m taking six new ones a day and 
that’s that.” 

“Sir, at that rate, they’ll pile up 
from here all the way back to Train- 
ing, and the colonel will — ” 
Poffis’s eyes glinted. 

“I know how many new patients 
I can handle in a day, Moklin. If 
the colonel wants me to take on 
eight a day, ten a day, twelve a 
day, then / am going to end up on 
the other side of these bars, and 
the colonel can see how that works 
out. Let them pile up. That’s better 
than sending back fake cures. 
There’s a cause to this mess some- 
where. The sooner that dawns on 
them, the quicker they’ll slap the 
clokal detonak on this whole re- 
gion, and burn out the pus. Now 
let’s have the keys to the cell so I 
can get started.” 

Moklin dazedly handed over the 
keys to the cell. 



SWEET REASON 



83 




n 

G arvin, stupefied, was grappling 
with the idea that the Centran 
thought six new patients a day, 
with routine follow-up treatment, 
was about right. If Garvin got six 
patients really cured in a year, it 
w'as cause for celebration. Baffled, 
he took a fresh look at the patient 
Poffis was ready to treat. 

This patient had watched with in- 
terest the exchange between Poffis 
and Moklin, but now stiffened as 
he saw Poffis come toward the cell. 
He threateningly approached the 
bars, bared his teeth and suddenly 
reached out through the bars to 
take a grab at Poffis’s uniform. 

Garvin watched intently, wonder- 
ing what Poffis could possibly do 
now. 

Poffis instantly seized the out- 
stretched hand, whirled and yanked 
downward. 

The patient screamed and slam- 
med against the bars. 

Poffis promptly kicked him back 
against the opposite wall, then un- 
locked the cell door, went in, 
banged the door shut and tossed the 
keys to Moklin. The patient shook 
his hand dazedly, felt his shoulder, 
glared, let out a roar of rage and 
sprang across the cell at Poffis. 

Poffis whirled, shot out a leg, 
tripped the patient, and sent him 
smashing head-first into the far 
comer of the cell. 

The patient lay on his face for 
about fifteen seconds, then sat up 
dazedly, stared at Poffis and sucked 
in a deep breath. His voice came 
out loud and ringing. 



“I got a right to go to a rest 
home! Fm crazy! I’m a patient! I’m 
sick! You can’t touch me! I got a 
right to go to a rest home!” 

Poffis said angrily, “If I knew 
where that idea came from, I could 
get this work-load down to normal. 
All right, Moklin. Read the charge.” 

Captain Moklin unfolded a long 
sheet of paper and read in a clear 
sober voice: 

“Prisoner committed * following 
acts, which have been proved by 
careful and thorough inquiry. He: 

“1) Threatened to beat up his 
own mess-mates, and then took their 
food from them by force. 

“2) Threatened his squad-leader 
with a knife, when reprimanded. 

“3) While off-duty, struck an eld- 
erly man who happened to step in 
his way, thus bringing disgrace on 
the armed forces. 

“4) On being charged as above, 
laughed in the face of his com- 
manding officer. Lieutenant Boggis, 
and referred to Lieutenant Boggis as 
a ‘molk.’ 

“5) Struck Lieutenant Boggis on 
the face with his open hand. 

“6) Threatened Lieutenant Bog- 
gis that if Lieutenant Boggis de- 
fended himself, he (the prisoner) 
would state under oath that Lieuten- 
ant Boggis struck first. 

“7) Resisted the guards summon- 
ed to the scene. 

“8) While under detention, an- 
nounced to everyone within hearing 
that he would receive a medical 
discharge and be home living on 
a pension while those who did their 
duty would be eaten up by Mikerils 
for their pains. Prisoner taunted all 



84 



IF 




the law-abiding soldiers within hear- 
ing that they would soon be at the 
front defending him, 

“9) By voice and act, abused 
everyone in authority who came near 
him during detention. 

“10) Refused to cooperate with 
properly designated authorities in 
curbing his undisciplined actions. 
This refusal was compounded by dis- 
respect and insult, and reflects no 
detectable principle or ideal, but 
merely -an undisciplined, willful, ill- 
governed nature, which is urgently 
in need of correction.” 

Captain Moklin lowered the pa- 
per. “That’s it, sir.” 

4 4T see,” said Poffis. “Well, well. 

JL Here we have a full-blown 
case of it.” He studied the patient, 
who got to his feet, looking appre- 
hensive and defiant. 

“Now, then,” said Poffis, “the 
first thing to realize is that how 
you got here doesn’t matter. What 
matters is that you’re here. This is 
the trap right next to the drain. 
Either we cure you, or they shoot 
you. And we aren’t given much 
time to cure you.” 

“I’m sickr cried the prisoner. “I 
want to go to a rest — ” 

“Luckly,”,said Poffis, “we’ve got 
just the way to cure you. We’ve de- 
veloped it over several thousands 
of years. There are only two things 
you need to know about this cure: 
It’s quick. And it hurts.” 

The prisoner opened his mouth, 
and shut it again. Poffis was mov- 
ing right along like a planet in its 
orbit, and showed no sign of stop- 
ping for anything. 



‘There’s one reliable way,” said 
Poffis, “that Nature teaches what’s 
right and what’s wrong. When you 
do right, you get rewarded. When 
you do wrong, you get hurt. Our 
method is the same, but more con- 
densed.” 

**Look” said the patient exasper- 
atedly, one hand outstretched, “I’m 
not responsible. You can’t blame me 
for — ” 

“The basic idea of the cure is 
very simple,” said Poffis briskly. 
“It is based on the observation of 
sages, that there is a real inner 
self, which is not subject to the 
phenomena of the physical world, 
and an outer self which is.” 

A succession of expressions 
crossed the patient’s face, and end- 
ed with a look of defiant outrage. 
“To the Mikerils with all this 
stuff!” He followed that with a 
piece of profanity that took Gar- 
vin’s breath away, but that left Poffis 
and Moklin visibly imtouched. 

“The real inner self,” said Poffis, 
“is conscious of events, because it 
is ‘connected,’ by resonances and 
various nerve-tracts, with the, outer 
physfcal self that exists in the physi- 
cal world, and is a type of living pro- 
toplasmic machine, serving the in- 
ner spiritual self which is not physi- 
cal.” 

The patient shouted, “I’m crazy! 
I WANT TO GO TO A REST 
HOME!” 

Poffis moved steadily along: ‘To 
properly treat the patient, it is 
necessary to distinguish between the 
true inner self of the patient, the 
outer physical self wtdch is the 
medium through which the patient 



SWEET REASON 



85 





contacts and is contacted by the phy- 
sical world, and the various traits, 
habits and emotions which manifest 
outwardly through the physical 
body, and inwardly by coloring the 
information passed to the brain and 
thence to the real self.” 

The patient stamped his • foot. 
“Ah for — ” 

“The real self,” said Poffis, “is 
strictly blameless. The trouble comes 
from wrong traits and attitudes hav- 
ing been established, usually in 
childhood, and by their habitual 
presence having generated emotions 
which falsely color the information 
passed" to the brain. The cure for 
this is best administered early, by 
the parent. By inflicting pain with- 
out damage, the parent breaks the 
grip of the wrong emotion, destroys 
its effects in distorting the infor- 



mation passed to the brain and dem- 
onstrates that emotions are tem- 
porary and changeable. Seeing the 
wrong emotipn flee before the hand 
of the parent, the child is embolden- 
ed to strike down the wrong emo- 
tion himself, and takes the first 
step towards becoming master in 
his own house.” 

T he patient ground his teeth, and 
looked around like one seeking 
sympathy for the heavy burden un- 
der which he labors. 

“Punishment, “ said Poffis method- 
ically, “should be swift, intense and 
fleeting, with proper suggestions for 
future improvement, and should be 
ended without vindictiveness when 
the right attitude is firmly estab- 
lished. That’s the theory. Now for 
the practise.” 

The patient leaned against the 
bars in an attitude of exaggerated 
boredom, and looked ready to fall 
asleep anytime. 

‘The practise,” said Poffis, “is 
even simpler than the theory. By 
appropriate action, we first permit 
the undesirable traits to manifest, 
and promptly deliver painful con- 
sequences on each occasion. Next 
we administer a general treatment 
designed to loosen up bad traits and 
induce a cooperative frame of mind, 
during which we urge improvement. 
Following this comes formal punish- 
ment, then the actual recovery. All 
this is basically very simple, the dif- 
ficulty being to properly suit the 
treatment to the individual patient. 
That’s the practise. Now you have it, 
and your mind will retain enough so 
that it may be of use to you later. 



86 



IF 




It’s time. Prepare for treatment.” 

Outside the cell, Moklin opened 
a faucet that filled a bucket half- 
full of water. He tossed a sponge 
into the bucket, picked up a clean 
towel and a first-aid kit, set a chair 
just outside a comer of the cell 
and dusted off the seat of the chair 
with a whisk broom. 

The patient glanced around with a 
scowl and gave the cell door a quick 
shake. The door was solidly locked. 

Poffis glanced at the wall clock, 
then cleared his throat with a some- 
what pompous, false and irritating 
sound. He said, “Now, first, permit 
me to point out — ah — that this 
method, while it could be used for 
wrong purposes, is in fact only used 
for the real good and the gen- 
uine — ” 

Dr. Garvin, outside the cell, 
squinted at Major Poffis, and tried 
to get him back into focus. By some 
trick of vocal wizardry, Poffis now 
began to project such an air of 
sweet reasonableness that even Gar- 
vin felt the urge to get Poffis by 
the throat and bang his head against 
the wall. Garvin had no trouble 
overcoming this impulse, but the 
patient abruptly cea^ looking for 
a way out, and eyed Pdffis. 

“ — welfare of the patient,” Pof- 
fis was saying sweetly. “The entire 
treatment is meant for the patient, 
who, deprived of proper parental 
assistance in the initial stages of 
character-formation, is thus disad- 
vantaged by his defective self-con- 
trol. We assist the deprived patient 
in many areas — ” 

“GVr,” said the patient. His 
tail flicked back and forth, and his 



lips drew back to disclose large 
sharp teeth. 

“ — always,” said Poffis piously, 
“to aid in whatever measure may be 
granted to us the unfortunate, un- 
derprivileged — ” 

The patient blurred forward, seiz- 
ed Poffis around the waist* and 
slammed him to the floor. 

Poffis landed stretched out, his 
forearms taking much of the im- 
pact, rolled aside fast as his patient 
took a flying kick at him, bounded 
to his feet and landed a blow that 
sent the patient .sprawling. 

As the patient stumbled, dazed 
and fearful, to his feet, Poffis seem- 
ed to undergo a delayed action from 
the fall he’d suffered. He gripped 
his side and tottered around the cell 
like someone in the last stage of 
physical deterioration. 




SWEET REASON 



87 




This was too good an opportmjity 
for the patient to resist. He hastened 
over to start a blow from the floor 
up, aimed for Poffis’s jaw. 

Poffis, however, recovered with 
miraculous speed, moved aside as 
the blow whistled past and smashed 
the patient on the jaw. 

Garvin watched in stupefaction as 
Moklin stepped forward with the 
water bucket. 

Poffis was now bent over the un- 
conscious patient, tenderly bathing 
his bloodied face with a wet sponge. 

Ill 

A s the patient came to and looked 
around dazedly, Poffis at once 
began to plead, “Now look here, I 
am your officer. You can’t — ” 
The patient at once caught the 
pleading tone, and the words “I 
am your officer.” He reacted with 
still-fast reflexes. 

“C«i, can^t ir he snarled. He 
staggered to his feet with Poffis’s 
help, and immediately tried to plant 
his knee in Poffis’s groin. 

Poffis turned too fast, and sank 
his fist in his patient’s midsection. 

Dr. Garvin watched the patient 
collapse and lie motionless. 

Poffis now dumped a bucket of 
water on the patient, brought him 
to, and as the patient looked around 
dazedly Poffis bent over him and 
said sympathetically, “Understand, 
none of this meant for the real 
you. We have to retrain your habits 
and attitudes, and this is the quick- 
est way. I realize what you’re go- 
ing through, because I’ye been 
through the same thing myself.” 



The patient sat up dizzily. Some 
instinct for self-preservation appar- 
ently prompted him to keep Poffis 
talking. “You — you did?” 

“Yes,” said Poffis reminiscently. 
“I’ve been through the whole thing. 
You see, I had bad habits.” A tinge 
of regret entered his voice. “And 
wrong attitudes, and I didn’t even 
know it. That’s how it works. No 
one could reason with me, or get 
through to me by anything that 
boiled down to reason, because, you 
see, this wrong attitude of mine 
distorted everything, and I couldn’t 
understand things right.” 

Garvin was staring, wondering 
what would happen next. Poffis’s 
voice was starting to grow heated. 

“So,” said Poffis emotionally, 
“they stuck me in a cell, and for 
these bad habits and wrong atti- 
tudes they beat me up, and slammed 
me all around,” He sucked in a deep 
breath. '"Sure I had it coming, I 
deserved it. Because of the bad hab- 
its.” His voice dropped. “But I 
felt every blow. It was meant for 
the bad habits. But I felt it.” 

There was now an impression of 
smoldering resentment building up 
behind Poffis’s expressionless face. 
The patient glanced around ner- 
vously. 

“Bad habits,” said Poffis flat- 
ly. "They got me in all that trouble. 
And I suffered. I hate them I” 
“Sure,” said the patient nervous- 
ly. “I can appreciate — ” 

“I hate bad habits, bad traits, bad 
emotions,” said Poffis, his voice ris- 
ing, “But they’ve been beat out of 
me, so now there’s only one way I 
can get back at them,” 



88 



IF 




The patient tried a quick shake 
of the cell door. It was still locked. 

“And that,'* said Poffis, “is to 
find them in someone else," 

The patient’s eyes were wide- 
open.* “Hey, now. Wait a minute. 
Listen, now!” 

“Right here", snarled Poffis, gaz- 
ing intently at the patient, “I see 
conceit, arrogance, carelessness — ” 
Poffis’s voice, already charged 
with emotion, took on a tone sug- 
gestive of rending flesh and pop- 
ping bones. He tore off his tunic 
and tossed it toward a corner of 
the cell, where Moklin with one 
deft motion snapped it out through 
the bars and laid it on the chair, 
neatly folded. 

Patient and psychotherapist were 
suddenly flashing around the cell in 
a blur of speed, the prisoner scream- 
ing at the top of his lungs, “You 
can’t! Help Your’e responsible! 
STOPI“ 

WHAM! 

T he cell was one flying tangle of 
furry arms, legs and tails, with 
now the prisoner’s horrified face in 
view, and now Poffis’s grim visage. 
Grunts, screams and gasps resound- 
ed like the sounds of a medieval tor- 
ture chamber,. 

Captain Moklin, watching, grinned 
and nodded. 

Dr. Garvin looked on in horri- 
fied stupefaction, staring at the 
chaos resolved momentarily into 
grim scenes. 

For 501 instant the prisoner was 
flattened out on the floor. 

Then he was slammed motion- 
less against the bars. 

SWEET REASON 



Next he was suspended in midair, 
one outstretched arm against the 
ceiling. 

A fraction of a second later, it 
was one chaos of violence all over 
again. 

Interspersed with the violence was 
Poffis’s grim voice: 

“You will listen 
“You will try! 

“You will learn!” 

There was a sudden crash, and 
the prisoner was saying rapidly, “All 
right! ni do it! Sure, 77/ do it! Any- 
thing you say!” 

Poffis stared intently into the 
prisoner’s eyes. “You look crafty. 
You don’t mean it.” 

The cell exploded into chaos. 

The prisoner screamed, “I prom- 
ise\ I mean it!” 

Poffis stared deep into his eyes. 
“Close, but you’re not there yet.” 
The violence ended the next time 
with a cry of despair. Then Poffis 
straightened. “Moklin!” 

“Yes, sir! The lash?” 

“The board.” 

Moklin handed in a medium-sized 
solidly made paddle. 

The prisoner stared as Poffis took 
it, and said in a kindly voice, “Bend 
over, son. Grip the bars.” 

The prisoner swallowed, tore his 
gaze from the paddle, bent and took 
hold of the bars with both hands. 

Poffis took the paddle in a prac- 
ticed grip. 

“You have committed ten serious 
offenses. For each offense, there 
must be a blow. The blows must be 
hard, or they will not be punish- 
ment. Hold on tight. MoklinV* 

“Yes, sir?” 



89 




“Read the offenses.” 

Moklin raised the list, and read 
slowly and distinctly. At the end of 
each numbered offense, Poffis de- 
livered a staggering blow. 

Toward the end, as the list went 
on and on, the prisoner began to 
sob, but continu^ to tightly grip 
the bars. 

At last, the list, which seemed 
to Garvin, watching dazedly, to be 
ten times as long as when it was 
first read — at last this list came to 
an end. 

Moklin said soberly, “That is the 
end of the list of offenses, sir.” 
Poffis said. So be it. Take the 
board.” He handed the paddle out 
through the bars. 

The prisoner collai>sed on the 
floor, sobbing uncontrollably. 

Poffis waited a moment, then said, 
“Prisoner, that ends the punishment. 
But punishment is not necessarily 
the same as repayment. You have, 
by your actions, done grave dam- 
age to the Integral Union itself. Yet 
the Integral Union feeds and shel- 
ters you. You have attacked what 
defended you. Are you sorry?” 

''Yes*' cried the prisoner. 

Poffis nodded. “Good. Look at 
me. Are you going to do betterT* 
"YesV^ 

Poffis nodded slowly. “Yes, I see 
you mean it. MoklinV* 

“Yes, sir?”. 

“This prisoner has hard work in 
front of him. He will need to sleep, 
but first he needs something to 
ease the pain, and he also needs a 
little warm thin gruel. Take care of 
this at once. ” 

“Yes, sir.” 



G arvin, still watching in a sort of 
daze, saw Poffis help the pris- 
oner to his feet, to ease him, very 
carefully, warning him where to 
put his hands and feet, ontg the 
cot. To Garvin’s astonishment, the 
prisoner, still sobbing, gripped Pof- 
fis’s hand in what appeared to be 
gratitude. 

Poffis said gently, “Don’t worry 
son. You may think we’re going to 
half-kill you. But we’ll get you out 
of it.” 

Moklin stepped into the* cell, car- 
rying a small bowl in one hand, 
and a jar of bandages in the other. 

Poffis stepped out of the cell and 
beckoned Garvin into the next room. 
Uncertain what to expect, Garvin 
followed with unspoken reservations. 
Poffis shut the door behind them. 

“Now, just what the devil is go- 
ing on at Mental Institution 16?” 
Garvin said, “Why just standard 
treatment.” 

"Whose standard treatment?” 
“Well — ” 

“What is it?” 

Garvin drew a slow deep breath, 
and described it. 

Poffis shook his head. 
“Conceivably that may work on 
Earthmen. But a thing like that 
won’t work on Centrans.” 

“Is that so?” said Garvin, his 
professional pride touched. “Well, 
all I can say is, it certainly is more 
scientific than the procedure you 
use!” 

“Obviously,” said Poffis, “that’s 
exactly what’s wrong with it. The 
techniques of Science were develop- 
ed for use on inanimate objects** 

As Garvin grappled with this 



90 



IF 




statement. Poffis said, “Observe 
what has happened. Science came 
into existence to solve purely physi- 
cal problems. To solve these 
problems it was necessary to ex- 
clude emotional considerations. The 
forces operative in this physical 
world are different from the forces 
operative in the emotional world. 
It is as if one were land and the 
other sea. The seafarer who goes 
ashore has little need for nets, lines 
and a knowledge of the tides, winds, 
and currents. But when he has built 
up his structure on solid land, is 
he then automatically fitted to go 
back to sea, relying exclusively on 
land methodsl It won’t work. Dr. 
Garvin, except where, so to speak, 
the emotional sea has been frozen 
over, turned to ice on the surface. 
In the emotional world, to say, ‘My 
methods are entirely scientific,’ is 
similar to saying, ‘I have made an 
entirely scientific proposal of mar- 
riage.’ It is a cause for alarm, not 
confidence.” 

Garvin hesitated, distracted by 
the uneasy suspicion that there 
might be some truth to Poffis’s point, 
but stung by the implications. If 
psychology wasn’t a science, then 
wasn’t he, Garvin, a charlatan of 
some kind? ' 

Poffis said earnestly, “Why insist 
that your study must be a science? 
Should everything be jammed into 
the same mold, and any parts that 
don’t fit be thrown away? Just be- 
cause a hammer is useful, should 
we throw away screwdrivers, wrench- 
es, pliers and every other tool, and 
force the hammer to do work it 
isn't meant fori Or, by some kind of 




SV/EET REASON 



9 



verbal wizardy, have we got to 
represent screwdrivers, wrenches, 
pliers and other useful tools, as dif- 
ferent kinds of hammers? They are 
not hammers, my friend, any more 
than all useful studies are sciences. 
If you let such a distortion enter in- 
to your thought, you not only blur 
your picture of the subject you are 
thinking of, but also your picture 
of Science itself.” 

O n thinking it over, it seemed 
perfectly clear to Garvin that 
if psychology was not a science, then 
he, Garvin, must necessarily be a 
fake. , If psychology was not a 
science, then it followed that he 
v/as no scientist, and this meant that 
he was less than, for instance, a 
physicist, or a chemist, and if he 
admitted to being not a scientist, 
it followed that he would seem to 
be less than one of those incredible 
creatures, the political scientists who, 
everyone agreed, were actually no 
scientists at aU. 

All this went through Garvin’s 
head in a flash, and at the end he 
said cooly, “Psychology, Major Pof- 
fis, whatver it may be among Cent- 
rans, is universally recognized 
among Earthmen as the ‘science of 
the mind.’ I certainly don’t intend 
to argue this proposition.” 

Poffis was watching Garvin’s ex- 
pressions ihtently. “Psychology,” 
said Poffis, with the air of one who 
reluctantly concedes a point, “may 
deserve to be a science; it may have 
distinct scientific elements', but if 
you say psychology is and is only 
a science, then I say that in your 
respect for your subject, it appears 



to me that you are mistakingly throw- 
ing half your tool kit into the near- 
est ditch. The essense of Science is 
the Scientific Method, and the es- 
sense of the Scientific Method is 
the Repeatable Experiment. To have 
a repeatable experiment requires 
first that the object experimented 
upon be comparatively constant. If 
atoms could argue, fight back, run 
away, sulk, plead, throw tantrums, 
learn our terminology and use it 
against us, then we mig^t reason- 
ably have some doubts as to just 
how strictly scientific the study of 
atoms could be. But in that case, 
would the study of atoms be any 
the less important?” 

Garvin said hesitantly, “I came 
here to learn your method, so that 
I could combine your methods and 
ours — ” 

Poffis looked doubtful. “Your 
method, as you have described it, 
suggests to me the attempt to fix 
a malfunctioning groundcar by the 
use of analytical chemistry.” 

“And how would you explain 
your brand of psychology?” 

“Very simple. To begin with, we 
believe in sympathy, power of will, 
character, habit, love, association, 
contrast, the power of example, the 
soul, the spirit — ” 

“What a hodgepodge! You’ve got 
religion in there! You’ve got — ” 
“What we’ve got in there,” said 
Poffis, “is Truth, and we accept 
Truth from any source, including 
religion.” 

“But, of all the unscientific — ” 
Poffis momentarily paralyzed 
Garvin with a poke of his long 
forefinger.

IF 




“The one advantage of Science 
is that it enables us, where it is 
applicable, to reach Truth. Truth 
is the goal, my friend, and Science 
is one means of reaching Truth, 
where Science applies. Don’t for- 
get your quest. You are seeking 
Truth. Don't mistake the means for 
the goal." 

Poffis went out, leaving Garvin 
open-mouthed. 

Dazedly Garvin considered Pof- 
fis’s last' two sentences. 

“You are seeking Truth.” Cer- 
tainly this was so. Why had he ever 
been interested in Science in the 
first place? He was seeking Truth. 
And that warning, “Don’t mistake 
the means for the goal.” Could he, 
Garvin, possibly be like a boy who 
spent so much time laboring over 
his finicky but beloved car that he 
rarely actually went anywhere? 

The rest of Poffis’s argument 
was borne in on him. How the 
devil did you have a science when 
the thing you were working with 
was as unstable and changeable as 
the human personality and the 
human intellect? Science! Was it an 
example of Science when the ob- 
ject of the experiment got up and 
tried to strangle you, as had hap- 
pened twice » now to poor Hardi- 
son? Was it Science when the ex- 
perimenter fell in love with the 
object of the experiment, as had 
happened to Pangeist? And what 
about Hergeswalther, who got 
sucked into the patient’s fantasy, 
and was only gotten out again be- 
cause the patient realized what was 
going on? 

“Science^ snarled Garvin. “My 



toot, it’s a science. Only parts of 
it are scientific.” And, in that case, 
how was it going to get him to 
Truth? 

For the second time, it dawned on 
Garvin that Poffis was really a 
master psychologist. How the deuce 
had Poffis known what he, Garvin, 
had turned to Science for? And 
how had Poffis been able to drive 
his ideas across with such effect that, 
just a few minutes later, Garvin 
was accepting them as his own? But 
the main thing was — how was Pof- 
fis able to make cures while he, 
Garvin, spent half his time flounder- 
ing through the dark, and as often 
as not accomplished littie more than 
to give the patient a knowledge of 
the underlying theory, which might 
or might not work? 

Garvin hesitated, then went to the 
door. 

C aptain Moklin glanced up and 
smiled. Across the room, the 
patient slept peacefully. 

Garvin said in a low voice, “Does 
the major always use the same treat- 
ment?” 

“No. It depends on the patient.” 
That was helpful, thought Garvin 
sourly. 

Moklin said, “Major Poffis looks 
to see what is wrong with the pa- 
tient, then he fixes it. Down the 
corridor is one who is here because 
it is against his principles to obey 
orders. Major Poffis will break his 
arguments into little bits and pieces. 
He will make it all so clear that 
the prisoner will go out seeing the 
question in a new light. But most 
of these uncontrollables have a 



SWEET REASON 



93 




treatment more like this one here. 
Only, each treatment is different in 
the details, because the prisoners are 
different.” 

Garvin nodded. He was still get- 
ting nowhere. At random, to keep 
the conversation going until he 
thought of a new approach, he said, 
“No wonder the major complained 
about the work-load.” 

“Yes,” said Moklin, “the work- 
load is piling up, and the major 
hasn’t even an apprentice to help 
him.” 

Garvin nodded sympathetically, 
then blinked, “Apprentice? You 
mean you teach psychotherapy by 
the apprentice-system?** 

“Not I,” said Moklin, block- 
headedly literal-minded. 

“No, no,” said Garvin, “I mean, 
is that the Centran system for teach- 
ing psychotherapy?” 

**The Centran system?” said Mok- 
lin blankly. “Why should we have 
only one system? Also, there are 
schools that teach it.” 

“Yes, but you can’t have bothV* 
Moklin looked at him. “Why 
not?” 

' “Well, the results wouldn’t be 
uniform, for one thing.” 

“So?” 

Garvin looked blank. Here he 
was again. The Centrans, block- 
headed fellows, did some silly 
thing, and «when Garvin tried to 
explain why it was silly, his reasons 
evaporated, and he was left with 
this foolish feeling. 

“Well,” he said stubbornly, 
**obviously a man taught at a spe- 
cial school would know more than 
a mere apprentice. By the results 



not being uniform, 1 mean that 
the apprentice would be inferior” 
“Oh, you think so? With Major 
Poffis to teach, you think the ap- 
prentice would be laggardly in his 
efforts?” 

“Well, no, I can see the major 
would keep him working, but — 
after all, there are a lot of things 
to be taught. At a school, there 
would be a special teacher for each 
subject.” 

M oklin nodded agreeably. “And 
this special teacher will have 
a class with many in it, and split 
his efforts among the class.” 

“All right,” said Garvin angrily, 
“if this apprentice system works, 
why do the students go to school 
instead of apprenticing themselves 
to the major?” 

“Because,” said Moklin prompt- 
ly, “they are afraid to apprentice 
themselves to the major. Once they 
apprentice themselves to him, he 
will not let them go until they are 
almost as good at cures as he is, 
and he is one of the best there is. 
It will be nothing but work, work, 
study, practise, practise, and the 
major will see through excuses, pun- 
ish laziness, stimulate earnest hard 
work, judge with merciless accuracy- 
And we have been unable to find 
any students who are anxious to go 
through this.” 

Garvin thought it over. “But at 
the end, his apprentice will be al- 
most as good at it as he is?'* 

“Oh, yes. Major Poffis will see 
to that.” 

“H’m.” Garvin paused to consider. 
He was totally fed up with floun- 



94 



IF 




dering around. Among other kinds 
of patients, Rolling Hills Rest and 
Rehabilitation Center, where Garvin 
worked, got a good number of un- 
controllables. The frustration in 
dealing with them was terrific. 
“Ah,” said Garvin, “is there any 
limitation — on age, race and so on 
— would the major take a — ah — 
an Earthman, past the usual student 
age — ” 

“With this work-load,” said Mok- 
lin, “the major would take anyone, 
provided the apprentice was in ear- 
nest, and, of course, showed some 
promise.” 

“How many apprentices can the 
major take at once?” 

“I don’t know. I’ve never known 
him to take more than three at one 
time.” 

Garvin thought hard. He would 
like to have a record of cures like 
the major’s. On the other hand, he 
certainly did not want the major’s 
undiluted attention focused on him 
alone. It followed that he would 
need to interest someone else. How 
about Hardison? After that second 
strangling attempt, Hardison had 
sworn that he’d always wanted to 
be a corporation lawyer, and the di- 
rector had practically turned him- 
self inside » out to keep Hardison 
from quitting, right on the spot, 
and heading for law school. 

Then there was Hergeswalther. 
His brief sojourn in fantasy-land 
had given him a new outlook. Who 
among the staff hadn’t heard him 
muttering, “I could go nuts myself, 
any time. Any time.” What wouldn’t 
Hergeswalther do to get a better 
grip on sanity?” 



Here are two additional pros- 
pective apprentices, if Garvin could 
only sell them on the idea. He 
glanced at Moklin. 

“How much do apprentices get 
paid?” 

“Not much as apprentices, beyond 
room and board,” said Moklin,. add- 
ing at once, “But they get very high 
pay when they have acquired their 
skill.” 

“H’m,” said Garvin, “that’s very 
interesting.” 

I n his mind, he was saying to 
Hardison and Hergeswalther, “It’s 
a tremendously exciting idea to me, 
from a scientific viewp>oint. Here 
we have a method that works, that 
turns out cures like clockwork, and 
it’s never really been scientifically 
analyzed.” 

“Yes,” he could hear Hardison 
say. “But, for God’s sake, Garv, to 
apprentice ourselves to this Centran 
witch doctor — ” 

“I know, I know. But that’s the 
only way to really get his methods. 
We could write a book afterward, 
detailing the underlying scientific 
elements of the cures.” 

“Hey, we could, couldn’t we?” 
Hardison had always wanted to write 
a book. 

Hergeswalther said uneasily, “And 
meanwhile, what do we eat?” 

“Well, we get room and board, 
and I guess not much more. But 
afterward we’ve got the ability. And 
then they really pay. Believe me, 
there’s plenty of business there. 
The patients are piling up fast. And 
we could cure them.” 

“Yes,” said Hardison, with a 



SWEET REASON 



95 




smile, “That would be a change, 
wouldn’t it? If our treatment would 
work** 

There was a thoughtful silence. 

“Just think, Walt,” said Hardison, 
“we coiild call the book. Elements 
of Centran Psychotherapy, 

Hergeswalther’s lips repeated the 
title, and he added softly, “by Her- 
geswalther, Hardison and Garvin.” 

“Yes,” murmured Hardison, half- 
aloud. “By Hardison, Hergeswalther 
and Garvin.” 

Garvin came out of his fantasy. 
Actually, he told himself, the book 
should be “by Garvin, Hardison and 
Hergeswalther.” Any fool could tell 



that it sounded better that way. Not 
that that argument would get any- 
where with the other two. Let’s see 
now: A, b, c, d, e, f, g, /i, i . 
Of coursel It was alphabetical! Gar- 
vin could rest his case solidly on 
that argument. 

Beaming, Garvin got his coat 
and turned to thank Moklin for a 
very pleasant visit. 

Moklin said, “I am sorry. Dr. 
Garvin, that you must go now. 
Shall I say good-by to the major 
for you?” 

Garvin shook his head. 

“Don’t bother,” said Garvin. “I’ll 
be back!” END

What Has Gone Before — 



Roan Cornay, a human born in mysterious circumstances 
in a ghetto on Tambool, grows up among outcasts and is kid- 
napped by a traveling Extravaganzoo, where he is valuable as 
a freak. Roan falls in love with the exotic dancer, Stellaraire, 
and gains the friendship of Iron Robert, the Strongest Being in 
the Universe. Roan and Stellaraire plan to desert the circus. 
Roan wants to seek fabled Terra, which he is convinced really 
exists, and to learn who his real parents were. But Iron Robert 
is badly wounded In a contest with the terrible Chinazel! and 
Roan and Stellaraire remain to nurse him back to health. 

The circus ship (originally a Terran war vessel) is attacked 
by pirates and havoc is wrought when the ship suddenly auto- 
matically accelerates to three G, which only Roan and Iron 
Robert survive. Stellaraire is pinned under a fallen beam and 
burns to death. Roan is badly burned trying to save her. The 
pirates, headed by Henry Dread, board the ship. Henry Dread 
is fascinated with the human Roan and takes him aboard the 
pirate vessel and has a doctor treat Roan's burns. At Roan's in- 
sistence Iron Robert is saved from the ruined circus ship and kept 
on the pirate ship, but in chains. Roan is resented by the crew 
of Gooks and Geeks (humanoids and non-humanoids), but fights 
his way into their respect, and finally gains the trust and friend- 
ship of Henry Dread. 

On the ancient Terran outpost of Aldo Cerise Roan wan- 
ders through a Terran park. The beauty of it reinforces his re- 
solve to find Terra some day. He emerges from the idyllic garden 
to find the crew in mutiny against Henry Dread, and moves in 
to save the pirate. Back on the ship, Henry reveals to Roan that 
he is not a mere pirate, but a commander in the Imperial Terran 
Navy, which is trying to build itself up again from Rim Head- 
quarters. 

They find a Niss warship, and against Roan's advice Henry 
approaches it. It fires, Henry's ship is fatally hit, Henry fires back. 
Roan gives the order to abandon ship and shoots Henry Dread 
in an argument over Iron Robert, who after all will not fit into 
the lifeboat. Iron Robert forces Roan into a lifeboat and Roan 
immediately takes over leadership. As the lifeboat is too small 
for the number of men in it. Roan decides to try to board the

were lifting a purse back on Croan- 
ie.” 

The crewman showed a quick, 
nervous smile. “Sure. I don’t want 
to wake nobody up.” 

“What’s these Niss like, Terry?” 

Roan turned and slashed his 
forearm across the mouth of the 
speaker. 

“That’s ‘Captain’ to you, sailor! 

I don’t know what the Niss are like, 
and I don’t give a damn. They’ve 
got what we need and we’re taking 
it.” 

“The size of that scow! There 
must be a million of ’em aboard.” 

“Don’t worry. Just kill them one 
at a time.” 

They watched the screens in si- 
lence. 

“Two miles,” the navigator hissed. 
“No alarm yet.” 

The lifeboat drifted closer to the 
swelling curve of the miles-long 
warship. The scrawl of great alien 
characters was blazoned across the 
dull black of the hull. Complex 
housings set at random caught the 
faint glint of starlight. Roan select- 
ed a small disk scribed on the metal 
plain below. 

“Match up to that, Noag,” he or- 
dered. “The rest of you suit up.” 

H e hauled i stiff vacuum suit 
from the wall locker, settled 
the helmet in place, flipped switch- 
es. Stale air wafted across his face 
from the suit blower. 

The lifeboat’s engines nudged her, 
positioning the lock directly over the 
hatch of the Niss ship. Roan stood 
by, watching the maneuvering on a 
small repeater screen. 



“Quiet now, all of you,” he said. 
“Any noise we make will be trans- 
mitted through the hull.” 

The two vessels touched with a 
barely perceptible rasp of metal on 
metal. 

“Nice work, Noag. You’re learn- 
ing,” Roan said. “Hold her tight 
there and magnetic-lock.” He lis- 
tened. Through his deck-boots he 
could feel the vibration of the en- 
gine; nothing more. 

“Cycle her open,” he ordered. 

“Hey, what kinda air these Niss 
use?” someone called. “My tanks 
are low.” 

“What’s the matter, you gonna 
stay here if it ain’t to your liking?” 
another came back. 

Air hissed as the lock cycled. 
Roan’s suit plucked at him as ihe 
pressure dropped. Through the op- 
ening the iodine-black curve of the 
alien hull blocked their way. 

“Cut into her, Askor,” Roan 
commanded. The crewman pushed 
into the opening, set a blaster on 
narrow beam, pressed the firing 
stud. The dark metal reddened, 
turned a glaring white, went bluish, 
then puddled, blowing away, driven 
by the pressure of released gasses. 
The soft spot bulged, blew out un- 
der the pressure of the Niss ship’s 
internal atmosphere. Askor worked 
on, widened the opening, cut out a 
ragged hole a foot in diameter. 

“Shut down.” Roan stepped past 
him, reached through, found a re- 
lease, tripped it. The Niss lock ro- 
tated up and away, exposing the 
lightless interior of the enemy ship. 
Icy air gusted into the lifeboat, 
bringing a faint, foul taint. Frost

formed on the metal where it 
touched. 

“Let’s go!” Blaster in hand, Roan 
stepped through the opening. The 
beam of his hand light lanced ahead, 
picked out curving walls, complex 
shapes fitted to what should be the 
floor. Festoons of odd-sized tubing 
looped across the room. There was 
a scattering of heavy dust over ev- 
erything. 

Silently, the boarders came 
through the broached hull and gath- 
ered in a huddle around Roan. Their 
breath made frosty puffs before 
their faces. 

“Where do we go from here?” 
Noag muttered. 

Roan threw his light on a nar- 
row vertical slit in the wall. “That 
might be a door,” he said. “We’ll 
try it.” 

nphe corridors of the Niss ship 
were high, narrow, lit by dim 
strips that had glowed to reluctant 
life in the minutes after the invad- 
ers had boarded. The walls seemed 
to press in on Roan. It was hard to 
breathe, and there was sweat on his 
forehead, in spite of the chill that 
cut at his exposed hands and face 
like skinning knives. 

“She’s pulling a half G,” Askor 
said. “There’s power on some- 
wheres.” 

“I don’t like this,” Noag mut- 
tered behind Roan. “If they jump 
*us now, we’re stuck like mud-pigs 
in a deadf^.” 

“Shut up,” Roan said. His heart 
pounding high up under his ribs, 
and what Noag was saying made it 
worse. He strode on, careless of 



sound now, emerged from the con- 
stricting passage into a wide cham- 
ber walled with honeycombed stor- 
age racks. The crewmen gathered, 
staring around. One went to the 
nearest niche, drew out a heavy 
bundle wrapped in stiff, v/axy cloth. 
He plucked at the bindings, tore the 
covering away, blinked at a gro- 
tesquely-shaped metal casting, pep- 
pered over with tiny fittings. The 
others craned, took the object as the 
finder passed it around. 

“What the nine hells is that?” 

“Hey, how about the next rack?” 

“Can’t you slobs even wait until 
after the fight to start looting?” 
Roan snapped. “Put that back where 
you got it — and cut out the chat- 
ter.” The men fell silent, listening 
for the enemy they had, incredibly, 
forgotten for the moment. 

“Come on.” Roan led the way 
out of the storeroom along another 
narrow way that stretched into dark- 
ness .... 

“These passages,” a crewman 
whispered hoarsely. “There’s miles 
of ’em. What if we get lost in 
here?” 

“That’s easy,” another offered. 
“We just pound on the walls until 
the Niss come to see what’s the 
matter.” 

“Where they hiding, anyways?” 
Noag shifted his power gun from 
his right fist to his left. “We been 
prowling this tub for an hour.” 

The corridor ended at a blank 
wall ahead. Roan raised a hand. 

“Hold it up,” he said. He indi- 
cated the passage along which they 
had just come. “I’ve been counting 
paces. We’ve come about half a 



100 



IF 




XXlll 



mile along here. That puts us on 
the opposite side of the ship from 
the hatch we came in by. All we’ve 
seen is cargo, supply and utilities 
space. We’re going back to the big 
corridor we crossed and move for- 
v/ard. I’m guessing we’ll find the 
personnel areas in that direction. 
We’re going to string out now, and 
keep our eyes open. The first man 
that talks without something im- 
portant to say will get a mouth full 
of pistol butt. Understand? All right; 
let’s go.” 

Roan led the way back a hundred 
yards and turned left into a wider 
passage. Like the others it was gray, 
featureless, faintly lit by a feeble 
glare-strip set in the ceiling, stretch- 
ing on and on into the remote dis- 
tance, too far to be seen. 

“I’m freezin’,” a crewman whined. 
“I ain’t gonna be able to fire my 
gun, my fingers is so stiff.” 

“Holster your guns and get your 
hands warm,” Roan said quietly. 
He went to a narrow door set in the 
wall, pushed at its edges. It yield- 
ed at the center, swung inward in 
two panels. He looked into a square 
room with papers scattered across 
the floor, a slanted table attached to 
one wall. There was a saddle-like 
seat mounted on a four-foot stand 
before the table. Roan picked up 
one of the paper scraps; it crumbled 
in his fingers. There were strange 
characters printed on the fragment 
be held. Roan stopped for a second, 
tried to gain some sense from the 
figures, but gave up. 

He stepped back out of the 
room, continued along the wide 
passage. 



I n an immense, dim-lit hall. Roan 
looked at ranked hundreds of 
saddle-like perches arranged in end- 
less rows on either side of foot-wide 
counters that ran the length of the 
vast room. A hint of a vile odor 
hung in the still air. Dust stirred 
underfoot as the nervous-eyed men 
stared around, fingering guns. 

“This is an eating-room, I think,” 
Roan said. “We’re getting closer.” 
“Closer to what?” a voice grum- 
bled. 

“We’ll take the next ramp up. The 
crew quarters will be somewhere 
near the mess.” 

“Hey — ^what’s that?” A short- 
necked, round-backed crewman 
pointed a blunt finger. Roan walked 
over to look. What looked like hand- 
fuls of fish bones were scattered in 
a mound seven feet long, inches 
wide, half-buried in dust. The crew- 
man dug a toe in, uncovered a dull 
metal object like a strap buckle. He 
kicked again, and a curious double- 
bladed knife with a knobby grip at 
the center skidded across ^e floor. 
The finder exclaimed, jumped after 
it, picked it up. 

“Neat!” he stated. He gripped the 
weapon, one stubby blade protrud- 
ing bn either side of his rock-like 
fist. “Ya get ’em goin’ and cornin’!” 
“Gripes,” another grunted, eyeing 
the heaped dust and the fish bones. 
“That’s one of ’em — ^what’s left of a 
Niss!” 

Roan looked around the broad 
room, saw other mounds. 

“Let’s get moving,” he said. “I 
want to see what’s up above.” 



EARTHBLCX>D

T hey were in a long, narrow, 
high-ceilinged room lined with 
saddles before racks and dusty 
screens interspersed with panels of 
tiny glass-like buttons. One screen 
glowed faintly, showing a greenish 
image of stars against space, and a 
tiny oblong that drifted, turning on 
its short axis. Above the screen, 
scattered beads of light glowed. 

On the floor below the panel lay 
two of the long dust heaps that had 
been Niss. The crewmen were busy 
picking ornate metal objects from 
among the fish-bones. 

“This guy must of been a big 
shot,” Noag rasped. “Look at this 
knick-knack!” He held up a star- 
burst done in untarnished yellow 
metal with a giant jewel at its cen- 
ter. 

“Chief, this must be the command 
deck, right?” Askor muttered. He 
was a hulking hybrid of mixed Min- 
id and Zorgian blood, with the stiff, 
tufted hair of the latter scattered in- 
congruously across the typical broad 
Minid skull. 

“I think so,” Roan said. “And 
that’s Warlock on the screen there.” 
“I don’t get it.” Askor looked 
around the long room. “Where are 
they? What are they waiting for?” 
Roan stood with folded arms, 
staring at the screen. As he watched, 
the blip that had been Henry 
Dread’s ship expanded suddenly in- 
to a vivid sphere that swelled, 
spreading out in ragged streamers, 
fading . 

“She blew,” Askor stated. “It’s 
kind of a funny feeling. I lived 
aboard her for thirty years . .” 
“In reply to your question,” Roan 



said in a harsh voice, tearing his 
eyes from the screen, “they’re all 
around us. We’ve seen forty or fifty 
of them in the past three hours.” 
“Yeah, but them was just bones! 
I’m talkin’ about — ” 

“You’re talking about the Niss — 
the crew of this vessel,” Roan cut 
in. He pointed to the scattered re- 
mains on the floor. “There they arc. 
Meet the captain and the mate.” 
Askor furrowed his heavy brow. 
“Somebody fired that broadside that 
knocked out Warlock** he growled 
sharply. 

Roan jerked a thumb at the glow- 
ing lights. “The automatics took care 
of that,” he said. “They were set 
to blast anything that came in range. 
I’d guess the power piles are nearly 
drained. That’s why her bombard- 
ment didn’t annihilate us complete- 
ly.” 

“You mean — they’re all dead?” 
Askor looked down at the dust and 
fine bones. His face spread into a 
broad grin. He chuckled, then put 
his wide hands to his chest and 
laughed, a booming guffaw. 

“That’s rich, hey, chief? Us pussy- 
footing around like that and there’s 
not a living soul aboard!” 

“Chee,” a bystander commented. 
“Think a’ that! How long’s this tub 
been floating around like this?” 
Roan kicked the bones aside, 
hoisted himself into the saddle be- 
fore the command panel, began 
punching keys at random. 

“I don’t know,” he said. “But I 
think it’s a fair guess she’s been 
cruising for the best part of five 
thousand years, with a full comple- 
ment of corpses aboard.”

I n a cramped, metal-walled cham- 
ber lost far aft of the immense 
engines, Askor looked sideways at 
Roan. 

“Looks like the Niss had a few 
captives aboard, eh, Cap’n?” 

Roan looked down at the scattered 
bones of men, and the smaller bones 
of women, and in the far corner, 
two small skeletons of children. Hu- 
man bones. Terry bones, moulder- 
ing among chains. 

“Gather up the identity disks,” he 
said emotionlessly. There was a 
clump of feet in the corridor. The 
horned head of Gungle appeared in 
the doorway, his eyes wide with 
excitement. 

“Cap’n, we found something! A 
slick thousand-tonner, a Navy job, 
banged up a little but spaceworthy! 
She’s slung in the boat deck!” 

Roan followed the man along dark 
ways littered with discards from the 
looting parties ransacking the an- 
cient vessel, now and again passing 
the scattered remains of a long- 
dead crewman. 

“Wonder what killed ’em all, 
Cap’n?” Askor kicked a mound, 
sent foul dust flying. 

“Disease, starvation, suicide. What 
does it matter? Dead’s dead.” 
Askor cast a quick glance at his 
grim-faced captain, said nothing. 

On the boat deck. Roan studied 
the businesslike lines of the sleek 
vessel poised in a makeshift cradle 
between malformed Niss scout-boats, 
the numerals printed across her 
bows, the ITN crest. 

“Looks like she took a hit aft.” 
Noag pointed out areas of fused 
metal beside flaring discharge noz- 



zles. “But they made repairs. Musta 
been getting her ready for some kind 
of sneak job.” 

Roan mounted the access ladder, 
shouldered through the narrow port. 
There was an odor of mildew and 
dust. He flicked on lights, went for- 
ward, climbed a companionway to 
the surprisingly spacious command 
deck, stood looking around at the 
familiar Terran screens, instruments, 
fittings. He threw open a wall lock- 
er, choked at the dust that flew, 
hauled out a ship-suit. He thumbed 
the tarnished TER. IMP. affixed 
above the pocket, read the name 
stencilled below. 

ENDOR. 

“Hey,” Askor said from behind 
him. “That’s the same as it says on 
one o’ them ID’s we took off them 
bones.” He sorted through the 
bright-metal disks, handed one over. 

“I didn’t know you could read 
Terran.” Roan eyed the halfbreed. 

“I can’t exactly read, Cap’n — but 
I’m good at rememberin’. They look 
like the same marks to me.” 

“So the captain died in chains.” 
Roan tossed the disk back. “I think 
his suit will fit me.” 

“How about it, Cap’n?” Noag 
called from the entry. “How’s she 
look?” 

“Check her out,” Roan said. “If 
everything works, load her up and 
figure out how to get those hull 
doors open.” 

Askor rubbed calloused palms to- 
gether with a sound like a rasp on 
rough wood. 

“She’s a sweet tub, Cap’n. Not as 
big as Warlock, but we never need- 
ed all that tonnage anyways. I’ll bet 



104 



IF 




she’s fast. We can hit and get out 
before the dirt-diggers know what 
hit ’em.” 

“We’re through raiding for a 
while,” Roan said. “There’s more 
loot aboard this hulk than we can 
haul — enough to make every man 
aboard rich.” 

“Not gonna raid?” Askor 
scratched at his bristled scalp. 
“Where we goin’ then, Cap’n?” 

“Set your course for a world 
called Tam bool. It’ll be listed in the 
manual.'’ Roan indicated the glow- 
ing face of the index set in the nav- 
igator’s panel. 

“Tambool? What’s there?” 

“My past — may be,” Roan said, 
and turned away to pore over the 
ancient star maps on the chart 
table. 

XXIV 

A skor sat beside Roan, staring in- 
to the wide, curved panoramic 
screen that filled the wardroom 
wall. He sipped his Terran coffee — 
a drink that it had taken many 
months to develop a habit for — 
then cleared his throat self-con- 
sciously. 

“It’s been a long cruise, Cap’n,” 
he said. 

Roan»didn’t answer. 

“A few more hours,” Askor went 
on. “We’ll be touching down at 
Tambool. Not much of a place, but 
there’ll be a few kicks.” 

“I’ll distribute a few kicks my- 
self if you don’t shut up,” Roan 
said. 

Across the table, a crewman 
named Poion laid down his ever- 



present stylus, closed his pad. He 
flickered his translucent eyelids 
down over his bulging eyes, finger- 
ing a wine glass delicately. 

“Gee, Chief,” Askor tried again. 
“It’s been nine months now since the 
fight with the Niss ship and all. 
You been snappish as a gracyl in 
moulting season ever since you took 
over as Captain. You didn’t used to 
be this way, back when you was 
Cap’n Dread’s Number Two.” 

“I’m not anybody’s Number Two 
now,” Roan said. “I’m Number One, 
and don’t ever forget it.” He drained 
his glass, refill^ it. 

“What do you seek on the minor 
world, Tambool, Captain?” Poion 
asked in his soft, breathy voic.e. 
J‘Henry Dread’s mission was not 
there.” 

Roan looked at the Beloian cur- 
iously. Poion seldom started con- 
versations and never personal ones. 
“I thought you could read minds.” 
“I read emotions. I compose with 
emotions. It is the art of my people. 
I am now scoring a composition for 
ten minds and a dozen experimental 
animals — ” 

“Let’s hear you read my emo- 
tions,” Roan cut him off abruptly. 

Poion shook his head as though to 
dislodge a troublesome thought. “I 
cannot. That’s why I asked you 
the question. I haven’t the talent 
for Terran emotions. They’re not 
like the others. They’re in a dif- 
ferent mode. More powerful, more 
brutal, more . primitive.” 

Roan snorted. “So you can’t tell 
anything from my mind?” 

“Oh, a little,” Poion said. “You 
are engaged in a noston, a return 



EARTHBLOOD 



105 




home. But your nostalgia is not the 
nostalgia of any other creature in 
the Universe.” He sipped his wine, 
watching Roan. “Because you have 
no home.” 

On the screen Tambool rose on 
the left and the ship turned on its 
gyros and an arrow swung. Roan 
gripped his glass, watching the world 
swell on the screen. 

T he vibrations of landing stopped, 
and Roan rose and walked 
back through the crew compart- 
ments. He found Askor by the exit 
port, rattling a gun nervously 
against his belt. 

“I told you this wasn’t like other 
ports,” Roan said sharply. “You’ll 
keep the men under control. They’re 
to pay for what they take. And no 
shooting.” 

Askor muttered but Roan ignored 
him. The port cycled open; Askor 
ducked his head and peered out at 
the puddled field, the drab row of 
sheds, the dismal town straggling up 
the hillside. 

“Gripes, Chief, what’s the crum- 
my dump got that’s so hot?” 

“Not much. But such as it is, 
I don’t want anybody bleeding all 
over it.” The other men had crowd- 
ed around now, decked out in their 
shore-going clothes, guns and knives 
in belts, anticipatory grins in place. 

“My business won’t take but a 
few hours,” Roan said. “While we’re 
here, forget looting. There’s not 
much you’d want anyway.” 

The men muttered and shuffled 
their feet, but no one said anything 
loud enough to take exception to. 
“No reception party,” Sidis com- 



mented as the men followed Roan 
down the ramp. “At least not in 
sight.” He licked his lips and watch- 
ed the windows of the sheds and 
peered at every shelter that might 
house an ambush. 

“Anybody that wants to land here 
can land,” Roan said. “Nobody 
cares, and you shift for yourself. 
It’s not rich enough to loot and it’s 
useless as a base. It’s a place for 
outcasts to come and lose them- 
selves.” 

Poion glanced sideways at Roan. 
Roan saw the glance.. He was talk- 
ing too much — ^more than the men 
expected of their tactiturn captain. 
It was a sign of nervousness, and it 
made the men nervous too. 

He walked on in silence, heading 
for the jumble of shacks behind the 
port. Had it been this derelict — this 
dirty and depressing when he’d left 
it as a child? 

It didn’t matter. He was return- 
ing as a man, and he’d come for a 
purpK>se. And let anyone who got in 
his way look out. 

R oan marched the men past the 
tented Soetti quarter, under the 
walls and towers of the Veed sec- 
tion, into the Gracyl slums. He al- 
most marched past his old house 
without recognizing it. Everything 
seemed smaller, dirtier than he re- 
membered. 

A group of unwashed gracyl in- 
fants dug morosely in their in- 
stinctive way in the dust of the 
yard, and Roan thought fleetingly 
how strangely each Gracyl reenact- 
ed his race’s evolution from a prim- 
itive burrowing rodent. The flower 



106 



IF 




garden was gone and no one had 
whitewashed the house for years. A 
suspicious Gracyl mare peered from 
the window where Bella had once 
flapped a towel to call Roan to 
meals. 

He swallowed a nostalgia that 
he hadn’t expected to have and 
marched the men on, past the gar- 
bage dump, now bigger than ever. 
No one knew, or asked, why he took 
that route. He walked confidently, 
his head up, his guns strapped to 
his hips, his boots kicking up de- 
cisive splatters of mud as though 
he knew where he was going. 

He had no friends to look for, no 
hint as to how to find Bella. But 
Uncle T’hoy hoy had had a favor- 
ite haunt — a tumbledown bar where 
he had been wont to huddle with 
other hardbitten slaves, sipping at 
vile Yill drinks and muttering un- 
knowable Yill secrets. It would be 
a starting place. 

Roan turned a corner, and the 
men behind him murmured. He 
could picture the grins spreading. 
This looked more like it, the pirate’s 
part of his mind noted automatical- 
ly. Ahead a carefully trimmed wine 
vine made an enclosure, and beyond 
could be seen the spangled tops of 
rich houses. A small party of Veed 
petty nobles was coming through 
the gate; some had iridion clasps on 
their pleated skirts and one had a 
diamond class-badge attached to his 
neck. The only weapons they car- 
ried were daggers and whett^ tal- 
ons, and their slithering gait had the 
native insolence of those who think 
daggers are enough. Roan felt the 
men slow behind him, watching the 



Veed. He turned and gave them the 
look of ferocity that came so easr, 
ily now. 

“All right, you hull-scrapings. 
I’ve warned you. The first man that 
gets out of line gets a bullet in the 
guts.” 

“Those Geeks friends of yours?” 
Noag inquired loudly, watching the 
Veed move past. Noag was a Gook, 
and he had no use for Geeks. 

“I have no friends,” Roan said. 
“If you think I’m kidding try me.” 

T he Veed had paused. Now two 
of them swaggered over. 

“Get you gone from the places of 
the noble Veed,” one said in flat, 
badly accented Interlingua. 

“And take these mud-swine of 
half-caste Terries with you,” the 
Other added. They stood with their 
hands resting on their knives. They 
looked as though they hoped some- 
one would give them some slight 
cause to draw them. 

“Okay if I kill these two?” Sidis 
asked hopefully. He was grinning, 
and his polished teeth shone like 
silver. 

“No killing,” Roan said. The 
other men moved up and began to 
ring in the two Ve^. They moved 
together, suddenly nervous, realiz- 
ing that these were not local out- 
casts. 

“Begone,” Roan said in the fault- 
less Yill that Bella had taught him. 
“My slaves scent easy blood.” 

The two Veed took their hands 
from their knives and made inscru- 
table Veed faces. ‘Take your vile 
scent with you,” one said, but he 
moved back.

“Before you go,” Roan said, 
“give me news of T’hoy hoy, the 
Yill bard and teller of tales.” He 
put his hands on his guns to show 
that it was no idle inquiry. 

“It is said the one you name can 
be found over his cups in any pot- 
house so undisceming as to accept 
his custom,” the Veed snapped the 
answer. 

Roan grunted and turned on to- 
ward the gate. He remem-bered that 
once the Veed quarters had been 
sacred and taboo, and that he 
hadn’t been good enough to be al- 
lowed there except when he ran 
messages or delivered merchant’s 
goods. But now he was Roan, the 
Man, and he went where he liked. 

He strode through the gate. Veed 
faces turned, ready to hiss their an- 
ger, but a silence fell over them as 
the small party tramped past. There 
were a few half-hearted cat-calls 
but no one moved to intercept them. 
The Veed had seen the byplay at the 
gate with the two daggermen, and 
understood that it was a time for 
discretion. 

XXV 

O n the far side of the Veed quar- 
ter, in the swarming section of 
the city. Roan halted the men at a 
tavern under the battered red, green 
and purple symbol of an all-blood 
establishment. 

“You wait out here,” Roan said. 
“I’ll send out a round. And keep 
your^hands off your guns and other 
people’s belongings.” 

There was a Yill inside. He wasn’t 
Uncle T’hoy hoy but he was of the 



Twix caste, one of those inconspic- 
uous ones who were always to be 
found in public places sitting unob- 
trusively in a comer to pick up in- 
formation, compose their strange 
Yill poems and be available in case 
there were messages to be sent. 

Roan slid into the cracked seat 
across from the Yill, ordered Bac- 
chus wine for himself and Fauve for 
the old Yill, then took out an oblong 
coin and put it on the table. 

The Yill winked his eyes at Roan 
and let the coin lie there. There 
were many things a . Yill would 
do for money and other things 
nothing could make him do. The 
Yill was waiting to find out which 
kind of thing Roan had in mind. 

“First,” Roan said, coming di- 
rectly to business in the Yill fashion, 
“I want to find my mother, Bella 
Cornay. Then I want to find T’hoy 
hoy, my foster uncle.” 

The Yill took the coin with point- 
ed fingers from which the fight- 
ing talons had fallen long ago. He 
deposited it under his tongue and 
watched while the clumsy, frizzle- 
haired waiter brought the wine. He 
smelled the Fauve, looked keenly 
at Roan and said: 

“I am L’pu the Chanter of 
Verses. I know you. The flame- 
colored Terr an boy who filled the 
empty life of the faded beauty, 
Bella. You were a small, wild flame 
of a youngling, and you have lived 
to beo>me a fire of a man. Your 
mother’s heart would have leapt 
for your beauty, which is that of 
all great beasts of prey.” 

“Mother is . dead?” Roan felt 
a slow sadness. He had never loved 



108 



IF 




his mother enough, and it had not 
been fair. All he’d ever thought 
about was Raff. 

“She is no longer alive,” the Yill 
said. He was being precise about 
something. Roan waited to see if 
he would say more, but he didn’t 
and it was no use to ask. 

“Uncle T’hoy hoy?” 

“At this moment, T’hoy hoy lis- 
tens at the house of the autocrat 
of the noisome Soetti. Would you 
have me fetch him?” Roan nodded 
and the Yill drank off his wine and 
slipped away. 

;Alone, Roan sat and waited in 
the small, dank tavern. The room 
smelled of a hundred liquors, poison 
to each other, and of alien sweats. 
Outside the flaps of the cellophase 
windov^ the men were bored, talk- 
ing too loudly and throwing knives 
carelessly at each other’s feet. Rain 
started up and drummed on the tin 
roof. It reminded Roan suddenly, 
overwhelmingly, of home. But he 
thrust the emotions back under a 
gulp of strong wine. Home was 
gone, had never been. Tambool 
was a place like any other, and in 
a few hours he’d be on his way. 
He had another drink and waited. 

Bella was no longer alive. L’pu 
had said. What did that mean? 

H e heard the men jibing at some- 
one outside and the tavern 
lighted with an opening door and 
feet shuffled. It was Uncle T’hoy 
hoy. He had gotten old, so old, and 
his gray face was like shrivelled 
clay, but it rose into smiles for 
Roan. 

“My boy,” he said. “Oh, my 

EARTHELCX)D 



boy.” And Roan saw that if a Yill 
could cry. Uncle T’hoy hoy would 
have cried. 

Roan embraced the old slave and 
ordered two more Fauves. 

“I guess I’ve changed,” he said. 
“Would you have known me?” 

“You have changed, but I would 
have known. you. Roan. But tell me 
the story of your years. Have you 
killed and have you loved and have 
you hated?” 

“All that and more,'* Roan said. 
“I’ll give you my story for your 
collection. But my mother. What 
happened to Bella?” 

Uncle T’hoy hoy reached under 
his belt, inside his tunic, brought out 
a thick gold coin and offered it 
to Roan. “Your inheritance,” he 
said. “All that remains of a once 
fair flower of the Yill.” Uncle 
T’hoy hoy was a story-teller and he 
couldn’t help being poetic. Roan told 
himself, suppressing his impatience. 

“Where did Bella get gold?” Roan 
fingered the coin. It was an an- 
cient Imperial stater and represent- 
ed a lot of money in the ghettos of 
Tambool. 

“She had nothing for which to 
live, with Raff dead and you stolen. 
She sold herself to the Experimental 
College for vivisection. This was 
her pay, and she left it for you 
in case you should ever return.” 

“And — she left no message?” 

“The deed speaks all that need 
be said. Roan.” 

“Yes.” Roan shook his head. “But 
I don’t want to think about that 
now. I have to hurry. Uncle T’hoy 
hoy. My men are itchy for action 
and loot, and if anybody even looks 

109 




at them sideways they’re going to 
cut loose. I came here to find out 
who I am. I know Dad and Ma 
bought me at a Thieves’ Market 
here on Tambool, but I don’t know 
which one. Did they ever give you 
a clue?” 

C4XTO clue was needed, Roan. I 
was there.” 

“You?” 

“I came here, all the way from 
a far world, to kidnap you,” T’hoy 
hoy said, remembering an old irony 
and smiling his strange Yill smile 
at it. 

“You!” Roan was grinning too at 
the unlikely image of the old Yill 
as a hired adventurer. 

“Ah!” T’hoy hoy said. He shook 
his head. “Better it were perhaps 
if all this were left untroubled un- 
der the mantle of time — ” 

“I want to know who I am. Un- 
cle. I have to know. I’m supposed 
to be of Terran blood — Pure 
Strain. But who were my parents? 
How did the ITN get me?” 

Uncle T’hoy hoy nodded, his old 
eyes remembering the events of 
long ago. 

“I can tell you my story, Roan. 
Your story you must find out for 
yourself.” 

“I’ve shot my way in and out of 
a lot of places,” Roan said. “But 
you can’t shoot your way into the 
past. You’re my only lead.” 

“We can^ here,” T’hoy hoy said, 
“following orders. We were minutes 
late at the bazaar — but the dealer 
talked a little. We trailed the pur- 
chasers, and they went to earth 
in a closed place where tourists 



never venture. When we saw them, 
we laughed at how easy it would 
be; a frail Yill woman and an old 
hybrid Terran in an ill-fitting 
suit ...” 

“Raff was never old.” 

“So we discovered. It was incredi- 
ble. He fought like a fiend from the 
Ninth Pit, and even after his body- 
bones were broken, he fought on, 
and killed all the others, and he 
would have killed me. But the lady 
Bella saw that I was a Yill, like 
herself, and that I would yield. She 
needed me, so my life was spared. 
Then by my oath I was forevbr 
bound to her and to Raff. And 
to you.” 

Outside, the men had begun a 
game of rolling the tankards their 
drinks had been served in, and 
shooting at them. Inside there were 
only Roan and T’hoy hoy and 
the bartender frowning worriedly 
over his pewters and casting glances 
toward the door. 

“Send out a refill,” Roan called. 
He poured his and T’hoy hoy’s 
glasses full. 

“Dad used to say I was Pure 
Strain. But whenever I asked him 
what made me any more valuable 
than any other more or less pure 
Terran, all he said was that I was 
something special. What did he 
mean, T’hoy hoy?” 

“Special you were. Roan, for 
many men died for the owning 
of you. But how, I cannot say.” 

“This market where I was bought. 
Tell me where it is; maybe the 
dealer who sold me knows some- 
thing.” 

“As to the bazaar, tell you I 



no 



IF 




will, but as for the dealer . 
alas, he died of a throat ailment.” 
“A throat ailment?” 

“There was a knife in it,” T’hoy 
hoy said a little guiltily. “Ah, I 
admit, Roan, I was not so even- 
tempered then as now.” T’hoy hoy 
told Roan the location of the 
Thieves’ Market on the far side 
of Tambool. “But let me advise 
you to stay clear of the place. Roan. 
It was an evil haunt of the scum 
of the Galaxy twenty-five years 
ago, and the neighborhood has since 
deteriorated.” 

Roan was watching through the 
window as a large company of Veed 
gentry went by outside; his crew- 
men stood silent, watching, but 
everything in their stance suggested 
disrespect. Sidis was tossing his 
knife in the air and catching it 
without looking, and grinning his 
steel-toothed grin. 

“They’re like children,” Roan 
started, and broke off. A lone Veed 
had hurried past, trailing the group, 
and the diamond at his throat had 
glinted like a small sun, and from 
the corner of his eye Roan caught 
a sudden movement, then a thud. 

H e was out in the street in a 
moment, in time to see Noag’s 
short cloak flutter at an alley mouth. 
Roan sprang after him and whirled 
the lumbering Minid around, but 
it was too late. The young Yill no- 
ble’s head dangled at a fatal angle. 

An angry buzzing was growing 
among the gathering bystanders. 
They didn’t like Veed nobles, but 
strangers killing them in the public 
street was too much. 



“Come on, you brainless slobs!” 
Roan yelled. “Form up and let’s get 
moving!” He looked at Noag, and 
the Minid fingered his knife and 
looked back. 

“You can stay here with your 
Veed and his diamond,” Roan grat- 
ed, and passed him by. 

“Huh?” Noag looked puzzled. 
“You can’t do that! It’d be murder,” 
he roared, starting after Roan. “I 
got no Tamboolian m^rieyl I don’t 
know the language! I won’t last a 
hour!” 

“Tough,” Roan said. “Cover him, 
Askor, and shoot him if he tries to 
follow us.” 

T’hoy hoy was trotting beside 
Roan, looking back worriedly. 
“Cleverly done,” he puffed. “The 
sacrifice will satisfy them for the 
moment, but you’d best not tarry. 
Farewell, Roan. Send word to me, 
for I would know how your saga 
ends.” 

“I will. Uncle,” Roan said. He 
pressed a heavy Imperial thousand- 
credit token into the old Yill’s hand 
and hurried after his men. At the 
gate he looked back. 

Noag was squatting at the alley 
mouth. Tears were streaming down 
his face but he was cutting the 
diamond off the dead Veed. 

XXVI 

I t was a steaming, screaming color 
blaze of a bazaar, and the dust 
was like yellow pK)ison, and as Roan 
marched his men through the nar- 
row, twisting ways between stalls, 
no one gave them a second look. 
No one gave anything a second look

in the Thieves’ Market unless it 
was something he wanted to steal. 

They came out into an open plaza, 
and wended their way across it 
among sagging stalls with sun-faded 
awnings. Merchants too poor to 
rent booths squatted by heaps of 
tawdry merchandise. Gold and 
green deathflies buzzed everywhere, 
and the air reeked of opulent per- 
fumes and long-rotted vegetables 
and sweat and age and forbidden 
drugs. They passed a scarlet and 
blue display of Tirulean silks that 
were worth fabulous amounts and 
a spread of painted esoterica that 
was worth nothing at all and came 
up to a crumbling wall cut from 
the chalky ochre rockface that 
towered over the square. A hand- 
painted sign beside a dark stair 
said YARG & YARG, LIVESTOCK. 
Under the first sign, another hung 
by one rusted pin. It said FOR 
SALE — VIABLE HUMAN EM- 
BRYOS. Something had been paint- 
ed beneath the words, but the let- 
ters had been scratched out. 

Roan turned to the men. “Go 
shopping,” he said, and they stood 
and looked amazed. 

“Go shopping. Spread out so you 
won’t look like an army; and don’t 
start anything.” 

“Where you going. Boss?” Askor 
inquired. 

“I’m going* to see how easy it is 
to become a father.” 

R oan climbed the narrow, hollow- 
ed steps, pushed past the rem- 
nant of a beaded hanging into a 
dark and smelly room lit by a crack 
in the ceilin^. From behind a desk. 



a mangily feathered Geek in tar- 
nished bangles looked at him with 
utter insolence. 

Roan kicked a broken chair aside 
and leaned on the desk. 

“What do you want?” The crea- 
ture rasped in a scratchy, irritable 
voice. “Who referred you here? We 
deal wholesale only, to selected cus- 
tomers.” 

“I don’t go through channels,” 
Roan interrupted. “I came to in- 
quire about buying an embryo. A 
human one, like you advertise out- 
side.” 

“We have thousands of satisfied 
customers,” the dealer said auto- 
matically, but in a tone that in- 
dicated that he had no need of 
another. He was looking Roan over 
distastefully. “How much you pre- 
pared to pay — if I should hap- 
pen to have something in stock?” 

“Money doesn’t matter. Just so 
it’s the real thing.” 

“Your approach appeals to me.” 
The dealer fluffed out his nK>ulted 
face ruff and sat up a little straight- 
er. “But you have to have at least 
one wife. Sodomate law. The FeSs 
would get me.” 

“Let me worry about that. What 
have you got?” 

“Well, I could offer you a good 
buy in a variety of FA blood 
lines — ” 

“What does FA mean?” 

“Functionally adapted. Webbed 
digits, heavy-gravity types, Kghtly 
furred — that sort of thing. Very 
nice. Guaranteed choice, selected — ” 

“I want genuine Terry type.”

IF 




“What about our number 973? 
Features the cyclopic maternal gene, 
rudimentary telepathic abilities that 
could be coaxed along — ” 

“I said Terry type. The original 
variety.” 

“Nonsense! You know better than 
that. It doesn’t exist.” 

“Doesn’t exist, eh? He bent close 
to the dealer. “Take a look. A good 
look.” 

The dealer clacked his tarnished 
beak and looked at Roan worriedly. 
His large round eyes were watery. 
He blinked and look surprised. 

“My goodness,” he said. Then: 
“The feet. You’d be surprised how 
often it’s the feet.” 

Roan stepped back and pulled 
a boot off and planted his bare 
foot on the massive old desk. 

T he dealer gasped. **Five digits! 
One might almost think — ” 

He looked up into Roan’s face 
with a sudden alarm. He slid off his 
stool and hopped back. 

“You’re not — oh, no!” 

“Sure I am,” Roan said. “I came 
from right here. Twenty-five years 
ago. And now I want to know all 
about the circumstances surround- 
ing my presence on your shelves.” 
“Go away! I can’t help you! I 
wasn’t here then! I know nothing!” 
“For your sake,” Roan said, 
“you’d better know something.” He 
took a gun out of his belt and hefted 
it on his palm. 

“My . my uncle. Uncle Targ. 
He might — but he left word he 
wasn’t to be disturbed!” 

“Disturb him,” Roan said omin- 
ously. 



The dealer’s eye went to a corner 
of the room, flicked back. 

“Tomorrow. Come back tomor- 
row. I’ll check the files, and — 
Roan came around the desk and 
headed for the corner the dealer 
had glanced at. There was the tiny 
glint of an oculus from a shadowy 
niche. The feathery alien skittered 
across to intercept Roan. 

“Uncle Targ isn’t active in the 
business any more! He’s not a well 
being! If you’d just — ” 

“But I see he still retains an ac- 
tive interest.” Roan swept the dealer 
aside, raised the gun and fired a 
low-power blast at the wall. Plaster 
shattered all around the Eye, ex- 
posing wires which led down to- 
ward a circular hairline crack in 
the f used-sand floor. Roan brought 
the gun up and fired at the crack. 

The dealer jumped at him and 
hauled at his arm, squawking. Ab- 
ruptly, the trap door flew up and 
a tiny old voice screeched in five 
languages: “Stop, cease, desist, have 
done, give over!” A naked, ancient 
head popped up from the opening, 
its three remaining feathers in dis- 
array. “Break off, check, stay, hold, 
cut short! Chuck it, I say!” he 
shrilled. “Terminate — ” 

“I’ve already stopped,” Roan 
said. “Uncle Targ, I presume?” He 
tossed the dealer aside, stepped to 
the opening. Spidery stairs led down. 
He bolstered the gun and descended 
into the heavy reek of sulphur di- 
oxide. Uncle Targ danced on skin- 
ny, scaled legs, screaming in at least 
four tongues' he hadn’t used be- 
fore. 

“You swear with great authori- 



EARTH BLOOD 



113 




ty,” Roan said when the oldster 
paused for breath. “Why all the 
flummery?” 

The creature skittered to the wall 
and plugged a wire dangling from its 
wrist into a socket. 

“I should have let you rot! I 
should have decanted you at the 
first sight of that accurst box with 
its crests and jewels and its stink 
of trouble! B^ause of you, my 
very own pK>uch-brother was hack- 
ed to spare-ribs in the flower of his 
dealership! But instead, I maintained 
you at the required ninety-eight de- 
grees Fahrenheit for days, and this 
is the thanks I get!” He stopped 
and breathed heavily for a mo- 
ment. Then: 

“Go away,” he piped in a calm- 
er tone. “I’m an old being.” 

“You’re an old windbag, but 
that’s your problem,” Roan said 
carelessly. “All I want to know is, 
who am I?” 

“All that shooting! You could 
have shorted my metabolic booster 
unit!” 

R oan looked around at the dim- 
lit room. There were no win- 
dows, but the walls were panelled in 
pure gold and somebody kept it 
polished. There was a chandelier 
hung with diamonds and a burl 
desk that must have cost a couple 
of thousand Imperial to import from 
Jazeel. The creature’s flimsy old 
body was* swathed in yards of sil- 
ver damask, and in one side of his 
beak he wore a ruby that looked 
like the heart of a rare red wine. 

“You’ve got a right nice sick- 
room,” Roan said. “And it’s a mat- 



ter of no moment to me whether 
you’re evading the Feds or the tax 
collectors or if you just like to 
be alone. But I’m still waiting for 
an answer.” He tossed the gun im- 
patiently and motioned with his free 
hand at Uncle Targ’s wires. “I can 
either plug you,” he said, “or un- 
plug you.” 

Uncle Targ squeaked around in 
the back of his throat as though he 
were pulling out rusty file drawers 
in his head. 

“I’ll have to get vour records.” 
he hesitated. “Don’t look, now.” 
He sounded as though he had them 
in his bra. 

Roan went on looking, but Uncle 
Targ played a tune with his fingers 
on a solid piece of wall and a draw- 
er slid out. A card flipped up. 

Roan reached over Uncle Targ’s 
shoulder and grabbed the card. 
Somehow, he’d expected to see 
names on it: his father’s name, or 
his mother’s. Or a country. 

Instead, it said, Pure Terran, Beta. 
ITN Experimental StatioHy Alpha 
Centauri. {Special source d.g.) 

“What does ‘Beta’ mean?” Roan 
asked. 

“Beta is you. Alpha was some- 
body else. And then there was Gam- 
ma, and the others.” 

“Others. Pure Terran?” 

“They weren’t viable.” 

“Were they my brothers?” 

Uncle Targ shrugged. “Alien bio- 
logies have never been a hobby of 
mine!” 

“But what else do you know?” 

“What’s the difference? Why do 
you care? You’re you and it seems 
to me you’re pretty lucky. Suppose

IF 




you were me, getting older and 
older and all the money I’ve got 
won’t buy even a minute of the 
pleasures you can get free.” The 
screech was a whine now. 

“Why I care is my business. Tell- 
ing me is your business.” 

Tremulously, the old creature un- 
plugged himself, teetered across to 
his stool, perched and lit up a dope- 
stick. It was obvious from the way 
he caressed it that he wasn’t allowed 
to have them very often. 

“So long ago,” he murmured, 
looking at the ceiling. 

“Did you know I was stolen?” 
Roan asked. 

“You are crude,” Uncle Targ 
said distastefully. He pushed a but- 
ton and the trap door slammed shut 
in his nephew’s face peering from 
above. 

“I’m waiting.” Roan reminded 
him. 

“I, ah,” Uncle Targ said. “That 
is, so many of one’s usual sources 
had withered away. You under- 
stand — ” 

“What made me so valuable?” 

“You? Valuable? You retailed 
for a miserable two thousand, if I 
recall correctly.” 

“Still, there was your brother. 
And someone went to considerable 
trouble to cohie after me.” 

U ncle Targ blew smoke from orif- 
ices in the side of his head. 
“Who knows? You do seem to be 
a more or less classic specimen of 
Man, if anyone has an interest in 
such matters.” He sighed. “I envy 
anyone who cares that much about 
anything at all. With me it was 



money, but even that palls now.” 
“The card said I came from Al- 
pha Centauri. Can’t you tell me any 
more than that?” 

Uncle Targ rolled one beady eye 
at Roan. “On the flask,” he said, 
“there was a name: Admiral Star- 
bird, and the notation ‘Command 
Interest.’ I have no idea what that 
might mean.” 

“Are there Terrans on Alpha?” 

“I know nothing whatever of this 
Alpha place,” Uncle Targ piped. 
“And I do not care to know. But 
there are no Terrans living there - 
or anywhere else, for that matter. 
The Pure Terran is a myth. Oh, ten, 
fifteen thousand years ago, certain- 
ly. They kept to themselves. Lords 
of the universe! Practiced all sorts 
of racial purity measures — except 
for the specially mutated slaves they 
bred. But then they had the poor 
judgment to lose a war. Since then 
the natural tendency toward environ- 
mental adaptation has had free rein. 
And with the social barriers down, 
the various induced mutations in- 
bred freely with the Pure Strain. 
Today you’re lucky if you can pick 
up what we in ±e trade call an 
Eighty X; a reasonable superficial 
resemblance to the ancient type.” 
“What about me?” 

“Umm. If I were to cut into you, 
I daresay I’d encounter all sorts of 
anomalies. How many hearts do 
you have?” 

“I don’t know. I thought you 
said alien biology wasn’t a hobby 
of yours.” 

“One can’t help picking up a 
few — ” 

There was a loud thud from

above and plaster fell down on the 
burl desk. Uncle Targ screeched 
and jumped for the trap-door but- 
ton. The lid sprang open and a 
solid slug whanged off the gold wall 
by Roan’s ear. The ancient being’s 
profanity cut off In mid-curse. 

Roan yanked out his gun and 
flattened himself against the wall. 
Through the trap door he could see 
Askor holding Uncle Tafg’s nephew 
by the neck and slamming the 
feathered head against the desk. A 
small ragged slave was scrabbling 
frantically for the beaded hanging, 
but Sidis’s unsheathed claws had 
him pinned by a trailing cloak. Roan 
fired a shot into the ventilator grill. 
It made an echo like eternity burst- 
ing. 

“All right, boys, break it up,” 
he called and clambered up into 
the shop. Sidis looked at him, grin- 
ning his metallic grin, and the slave 
broke free and bolted from the 
room. Askor waved the dealer in 
a wide gesture as though he had 
forgotten he were holding him. 

“Poion seen you come in here, 
and we thought we heard some 
shots. And then we couldn’t find 
you.” 

“So all you rowdies could think 
of was to shoot the place up. I 
told you to go shopping.” 

**Pay for stuff?” Askor tossed the 
dealer aside; he struck with a clat- 
ter of beak and claws and bangles 
and crept to a neutral comer. “We 
figured you was kidding.” 

Roan glanced down into Uncle 
Targ’s private retreat. The ancient 
lay on his back, glazed eyes wide, 
v/ith his mouth full of blood.

“Come on,” Roan said. “Let’s get 
out of here.” 

Back in the plaza the bazaar had 
died as though a sudden storm had 
slammed it shut. Roan could feel 
the eyes staring at him from be- 
hind blind shutters and past bare- 
ly parted hangings at narrow win- 
dows and through cracks in sagging 
facades. Askor glanced around, 
strutting. 

“I guess they know we been to 
town, hey, Chief?” 

“Shut up and march,” Roan said. 
This is what I always leave be- 
hind me, he thought. Fear. 

CCT don’t get it. Chief.” Askor 
X grumbled, sitting beside Roan 
in the eerie light of the control 
panel. “For better’n a year and a 
half now — ever since we lost War- 
lock — we been by-passing dandy 
targets, blasting balls to bulkheads 
from one two-bit world to another. 
And when we get there — no shoot- 
ing, you say. Go shopping, you say. 
The boys are getting kinda fed up.” 
“We stopped and took on sup- 
plies once or twice,” Roan said. “But 
I suppose that wasn’t enough to sat- 
isfy your sporting instincts.” 

“Huh?” Aw, that was peanuts. 
Just grocery shopping, like.” 

“With a few good-natured kill- 
ings thrown in, just to keep your 
hand in. You can tell the crew 
there’ll be pfenty of action now.” 
“Yeah? Say, that’s great, Cap’n! 
What ■ you got in mind? A run 
through the Spider Cluster, maybe? 
Knock off a few of them market 
towns that ain’t been hit for a hun- 
dred years?” 



“Nothing so pedestrian. Set your 
course for Galactic East.” 

Askor scratched at his hairless 
skull. “East? Why do we want to 
head out that way. Chief? That’s 
rough territory. Damn few worlds 
to hit, and them, poor ones.” 

“There’ll be plenty of worlds. 
And after the first couple years’ 
travel, we’ll be in a part of space 
no one’s visited for a few thousand 
years.” 

“A couple years’ run out the 
Arm? Cripes, Cap’n, that’ll put us 
in No-man’s-space! The ghost- 
ships — ” 

“I don’t believe in ghost-ships. 
We may run into Niss, though. 
That’s where the last big engage- 
ments were fought.” 

“Look, Chief,” Askor said quick- 
ly. “What about if we talk this over, 
huh? I mean, what the hell, there’s 
plenty of good worlds right here 
in this sector to keep us eating 
good for the next two hundred 
years. What I say is, why look for 
trouble?” 

“You’re afraid, Askor? That sur- 
prises me,” 

“Now wait a minute, Cap’n! I 
didn’t say I was scared. I just . .” 
His voice trailed off. “>^at I’m 
getting at is, what the hell’s out 
there? Why leave good hunting 
grounds for nothing?” 

“Alpha Centauri’s out there,” 
Roan said. 

“Alpha . That’s the place you 
said the real ITN was. Cripes, Chief, 
I thought you said we was through 
with that chasing around.” 

Roan came to his feet. “What do 
you think this is, a ladies’ discus-

sion circle? I gave you an order, 
and by the nine hells, you’ll carry 
it out!” 

Askor looked at him. “You 
sound more like old Cap’n Dread 
all the time,” he said. “I’ll follow 
your orders, Cap’n. I always have. 
I know I ain’t smart; I need some- 
body with brains to tell me what 
to do. I just made the mistake of 
thinking we could talk about it.” 

“We’ve talked enough,” Roan cut 
him off. “You plot your course to 
raid every second-rate planet be- 
tween here and Alpha, if that’s what 
it takes to make you happy. Just 
don’t forget where we’re headed.” 

Askor was grinning again. “That’s 
more like it, Chief,” he said. “This 
is what the boys been waiting for. 
Boy, what a cruise; It’ll be a ten- 
year run, cutting into new territory 
all the way!” 

“And no more talk about ghost- 
ships! Or live Niss either.” 

“Okay, Cap’n. But with some 
good targets in sight, it’ll take more 
than a shipload of spooks to scare 
the boys ok.” 

After Askor left the bridge. Roan 
sat for a long time staring into the 
main viewscreen, with its spread- 
ing pattern of glittering stars. 

So much for the next ten years, 
he thought. After that .... 

But there’d be time enough to 
plan that when the sun called Alpha

— which had served the freebooters 
as home for seven years now, since 
a stray missile had uncovered the 
underground depot in whicii the 
retreating ITN had concealed it, 
fifty-seven hundred years before. 

Sidis sat across from him. His 
grin was ragged now with the ab- 
sence of five front teeth, carried 
away by a shell fragment in an en- 
gagement off Rastoum the pre- 
vious year. Poion perched in his 
special seat, fitted up to ease the 
stump of his left leg, toying with 
a massive silver wine goblet. Askor 
was tilted back with a boot on the 
mahogany table-top, paring diunks 
from a wedge of black cheese and 
forcing them into his capacious 
mouth. 

“I called you here,” Roan said, 
“to tell you the cruise is nearly 
over. The story that last batch of 
prisoners told fits in. The sun ahead 
is Alpha.” 

“Not many of the old bunch still 
around, hey, Cap’n?” Sidis ob- 
served. “Bolu, Honest Max, Yack 

— all gone.” 

“Whaddaya expect?” Askor in- 
quired, with his mouth full. He 
lifted his alabaster chalice and 
washed the cheese down with green 
Bacchus wine, then belched heartily. 
“We been on, lessee, twenty-one 
raids in the last eleven years, and 
fought three deep-space engagements 
with wise-guy loc^ patrols.” 

“You can reminisce later,” Roan 
said. “I expect the ITN to pick us 
up on their screens any day now. 
I don’t like that, but it can’t be 
helped. If they let us alone how-

ever, I’m making planetfall on the 
fourth world of the system. Accord- 
ing to the records. ITN Headquar- 
ters is on the second. “I’ll take one 
of our soout boats from there and 
make the run in alone.” 

“Whaddaya mean, alone?” Askor 
butted in. “You need all the boys 
along on that caper, Chief, if I 
know my Terries!” 

“I don’t expect any trouble. And 
if I did, I’d still go in alone. A 
show of force wouldn’t buy me any- 
thing against the whole ITN. I’m 
paying a peaceful call, that’s all.” 
“From the stories we been hear- 
ing, I got my doubts the ITN has a 
cheery welcome for nosy strangers. 
What you want with them Terries 
anyways. Chief?” 

“I’m a Terry myself,” Roan said 
shortly. 

“In his origins a being finds hints 
of 'his destiny,” Poion murmured. 
“Alas, our captain knows his not.” 

wait for me on planet 
I four,” Roan went on. “And 
stay under cover. If I’m not back 
in . ten days, you’re on your 
own.” 

“Hey, you mean . .?” Sidis 
grin was sagging, hooked up on the 
bad side by twisted scar tissue. He 
looked from Roan to Askor to 
Poion. “You’re talking about let- 
ting the captain walk in there 
alone? And where does that leave 
the rest of us?” 

‘^You’ll be all right,” Roan said. 
“You’ll be happy. You can raid 
back down through the Eastern Arm 
and shoot up everything in sight, 
without me to nag you.” 



“Just like that, huh? Thirteen 
years together, and then, srrikkr 
He made a cutting motion across his 
throat. 

“I didn’t take you to raise,” Roan 
growled. “I remember you the day 
we met. You were pounding some 
Ycthan’s brains out against the 
bulkhead. You were doing all right.” 

“Back out through the Ghost 
Fleet, alone?” Sidis’s grin was a 
grimace now. “To the Ninth Hell 
with that! I’m going with you, 
Cap’n!” 

“I’m going alone,” Roan said flat- 

ly- 

“Then you’ll have to shoot me, 
Cap’n,” Sidis said distinctly. 

Roan nodded quietly. “That 
could be arranged.” 

“And me too,” Askor said. 
“Count me in.” 

“And I,” Poion said. “I shall go 
or die, as my captain wills.” 

Roan looked from one to an- 
other. He lifted his glass and took 
a long draught, put it back on the 
table. 

“You’re that scared of the ghosts 
of departed Terries?” 

Nobody spoke. 

“You Gooks amaze me,” Roan 
said. “All right, we four. But no 
more.” 

Sidis’s grin was back in place. 
Askor grunted and carved off an- 
other slab of cheese. Poion nodded. 

“It is well,” he said. “We four.” 

4 4 /bungle,” Roan asked, “you 

VJ" think you can navigate the 
Archaeopteryx now?” 

“Yeah, Chief,” Gungle said, grin- 
ning his snaggle-toothed Minid grin.

IF 




“Yeah, I think. You show me what 
to feed in, I feed it in.” 

“Suppose you were captain now. 
What course would you set?” 

“No offense, Chief, but I’d plug 
in a straight line back to East Sec- 
tor. Me and the boys, we heard 
back on Leeto about the Terry Ghost 
Fleets. There ain’t no civilization 
for parsecs. Just these dead worlds 
like Centaurus Four here, without 
even no air.” 

“What are your coordinates for 
the nearest allblood joy city?” 
Gungle grinned wider, flicked a 
chart of the Eastern Sector on the 
navigation screen and punched out 
a course to Leeto. 

“Okay,” said Roan. “You’re cap- 
tain in full charge until I get back.” 
“Huh?” 

“I’m taking Poion, Askor and Sid- 
is with me to Centaurus Two.” 
Gungle gaped. Roan took the 
heavy gem he’d worn on his chest 
since Alda Cerise and tossed it 
to the Minid, who hung it around 
his neck and threw his shoulders 
back and stood proud, the grin 
turning to a sterp look of dignity. 

“Now pipe the crew up,” Roan 
told him. 

“Men,” he said, when they had 
all assembled. “I’m going to leave 
you for a while.” He raised a hand 
to still the muttering that started 
up. “Meanwhile Gungle’s captain, 
and he’ll do any gut-splitting that’s 
necessary. And anybody that’s got 
any ideas about anybody else being 
captain had better think twice. 
That’s my Terran magic jewel Gun- 
gje’s wearing. As long as he wears 
it nothing can touch him.” 



The men rolled their eyes at Gun- 
gle and made magical signs in twen- 
ty-four different religions. But no 
one raised any objection. 

XXVIII 

4 4''T^hat thing really magic?” Sid- 
A is asked, as the scout boat 
nosed on toward the brilliant star 
that was Centaurus Two, with 
Archaeopterys four days astern, out- 
ward bound for Leeto. 

“It created magic in the heart 
of Gungle,” Poion answered. “He 
is now a man and a leader. It 
created magic in the hearts of the 
crew as well. They fear him. All 
this I could feel very plainly.” 

“Yeah, but that’s not what I 
mean,” Sidis started. 

“Look!” Roan was pointing at 
the forward viewscreen. 

“A ship,” Askor said. “Heavy 
stuff, too!” 

“It didn’t take ’em long to spot 
us,” Sidis said. “Somebody’s awake 
in these parts. ” 

“We’ll hold our course steady as 
she goes,” Roan said. “Leave the 
first move up to them.” 

“What if the first move is a fifty 
megaton ner amidships?” Sidis in- 
quired. 

“That’ll be a sign we ain’t want- 
ed,” Askor grunted. 

Roan tuned the all wave receiv- 
er, picked up star-static, a faint mur- 
mur of distant planetary communi- 
cations. Then the drone of a pow- 
erful carrier came througji. 

“Inbound boat, heave to and iden- 
tify yourelf,” a voice barked in a 
peculiarly intoned Panterran.

“Survivors from the merchant 
vessel Archaeopteryx,** Roan trans- 
mitted. “On course for the second 
planet. Who are you?” 

“This is the Imperial Terran Navy 
talking. Ye’re in Navy space. Stand 
by to receive a boarding party and 
ho tricks or we’ll blow ye to king- 
dom come.” 

“Are we glad to see you,** Roan 
transmitted. “Any hot coffee 
aboard?” 

But there was no answer, and 
the four ex-pirates watched the Ter- 
ran vessel growing in their tiny 
view screen. 

“Ah, Captain,” Poion observed 
sadly, “again the Terran Navy is 
a disappointment. You look for home 
and there is no home.” 

“Your emotion receiver’s work- 
ing overtime.” Roan said. “But I 
admit our welcome lacked warmth.” 

“Me, I feel like a fly that’s about 
to get swatted,” Sidis said. “Why 
don’t you ever read my emotions, 
Poion?” 

“You’re too stupid to have emo- 
tions,” Askor said. “We shoulda 
brought Trixie in. She could handle 
that Terry tub.” 

The ITN vessel came in, paced 
the tiny scout boat at a distance of 
fifty miles and then came along- 
side, looming like a dull-metal 
planetoid. There was a heavy shock 
as its magnetic grapples embraced 
the boat. 

’’Open up there!” the harsh but 
strangely estivated sounding voice 
said from the communicator. 

R oan nodded to Askor. He oper- 
ated the control and the four 



pairs of eyes watched the lock cy- 
cle open. Hot, dense air wooshed 
into the boat from the higher- 
pressure interior of the naval ves- 
sel, bringing odors of food and to- 
bacco and a pervading animal stink. 

Askor snorted. ‘Terries! I can 
smell ’em!” 

Boots clanged against metal deck- 
ing. A tall, lean man wearing an 
open blue tunic over a bare chest 
ducked through the lock. He had 
a lined, triangular face, and there 
was sweat glittering across his fore- 
head and chest. His, pale eyes were 
restless. He gripped a powerful 
rifle with both hands and looked 
at the three massive humanoids and 
then past them at Roan. 

“Who are ye?” he demanded of 
Roan, ignoring the others. 

“Roan Cornay, master of the 
Archaeopteryx.**** 

“Who’re these beauties?” he 
jerked his chin at the three Gooks, 
not looking at them. 

“My crew. We were all that got 
out.” 

“You go aboard,” the man said 
to Roan, keeping the power rifle 
pointed at him. “These others stay 
here.” 

Roan hesistated a moment. Poion 
caught his feeling and nodded im- 
perceptibly at Askor. Then Roan 
stepp^ accommodatingly toward the 
port behind the Man, and as he 
passed he half-turned, quickly, 
slammed the gun from the Ter- 
ran’s bands with a lightning blow. 
Askor caught it, flipped it up 
and let it point casually at its 
former owner. 

“I prefer to keep my crew with 



122 



IF 




me,” Roan said calmly. 

The Man had flattened his back 
against a bulkhead and his mouth 
was open. “Ye’re stark, raving 
mad!” he said. “I’m Navy. One 
yell ...” 

“ . and I’ll have your guts 
plastered on the ceiling,” Askor 
said, grinning. “Whattaya say, 
Cap’n. Let him have it?” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” Roan said, 
watching a rivulet of sweat that 
was- crawling along the Man’s neck. 
“Maybe he’s going to be nice after 
all. Maybe he’ll extend the hos- 
pitality of his ship to all of us. 
How about it, Terry?” 

And Roan smiled an ironic grin 
at himself. This was the first time 
he’d called anybody else Terry. And 
it came out like a dirty word. 

Askor nodded. “He’ll need to 
point his pop gun at us.” Askor 
pushed a thumb against the firing 
stud of the Man’s power rifle and 
bent it out of line. He tossed it 
back to the Man. “Don’t worry,” he 
said. “We won’t tell nobody it don’t 
shoot.” 

R oan walked close behind the 
Man as he went through the 
port into the Navy ship. “No need 
to be nervous.” Roan told the Ter- 
ran. “Just say all the right things 
when you ^ee your buddies.” 

A small, roundly built man with 
a high, pale forehead stood waiting 
for them in the hold. He wore the 
tarnished silver leaf of an ITN 
commander on the shoulder of his 
uniform and he was flanked by 
four armed Men. He had small, dim 
eyes that squinted at Roan and his 



companions, as though the brilliant 
lighting of the hold blinded him. 

“Some reason why ye didn’t dump 
’em back out into space, Draco?” 

Draco cleared his throat. “Dis- 
tressed spacemen. Commander Hull- 
wright.” 

Commander Hullwright frowned, 
still looking hard at Roan. “Aren't 
they all. But I see. This * one 
seems ...” 

“Yes, sir,” Draco said quickly. 
“He’s Terran, but I don’t think he 
even knows it. That’s why I brought 
him in to you.” 

Hullwright grunted, but to Dra- 
ca’s obvious relief he was looking 
at Roan and ignoring the others. 

“Ye speak a little Panterran?” the 
commander asked Roan. 

“Yes. I recognized your voice.” 

“Then why didn’t ye answer me 
hail?” 

“I did.” 

“Hmmmph. Blasted receiver’s 
prob’ly out again. Draco, see to it.” 
Draco drifted back, eyeiug Askor 
and Sidis nervously, and Command- 
er Hullwright forgot about him 
again. 

“Don’t know you’re Terran, eh, 
lad?” Hullwright asked Roan. “Ye 
must be pretty overwhelmed with 
all this.” He Located with a wave 
the Navy ship and himself and his 
officers. 

“I’ve seen ships before.” Roan 
said. 

“Um. Got an ugly tongue in 
your mouth. No doubt ye’re a dirty 
spy from Rim HQ.” 

“No.” 

“Fat chance ye’d tell me if ye 
were a spy. \^at’s your story?

What are ye supposed to be doing 
in ITN space?” 

“My merchantman Archaeop- 
teryx blew up a couple of parsecs 
back. I was outbound for Leeto 
for shore leave. We had a brush 
with pirates off Yound and I guess 
they mined us. We four escaped. 
I was afraid we’d drift forever.” 

4 C T eft ye’r ship and crew to 
fend for themselves, eh?” 
Hiillwright’s lip curled. “All right. 
I’ll give ye a berth and ye can 
start in the Navy, swabbing decks. 
Maybe ye can work up to some- 
thing. Maybe ye can’t. Take care of 
him, Draco.” He shot a look at 
Askor and Sidis. “And put the 
animals back on their boat.” 

“Wait a minute.” Roan said. 
“These are my men, and they’re 
hungry and thirsty. And I don’t 
swab decks. I’m a master.” 

“Right now you’re the most in- 
significant swab in the Imperial Ter- 
ran Navy, you puppyl” Hullwright 
barked. “And as for your ‘men’, 
they’ll have to find their own animal 
feed in space. Put ’em back and 
cast ’em loose, Draco.” 

Draco shuffled his feet unhap- 
pily. “Uh, Commander. They claim 
to be distressed spacemen ...” 
“What’s this — petty sentiments 
about distressed Gooks? What’s go- 
ing on, anyhow? Are ye in on this 
mutiny I keep hearing rumors 
about? What ...” 

The four armed men with Hull- 
wright had tightened up their ranks 
and one drew the gun from his 
holster. “Drop that power rifle, 
Draco,” he said. 



Draco dropped it. Sweat draped 
from the end of his nose. “Listen, 
Commander,” he said hoarsely, 
“they made me — ” 

Roan took a quick step while at- 
tention was centered on Draco. His 
right hand made an expert chop 
across the throat of the man with 
the unholstered gun. Askor leapt like 
a cork from a bottle, seized two of 
the Men in his vast hands, slammed 
their heads together in his favorite 
tactic. Sidis caught the last of the 
four as he was bringing up his gun, 
yanked the weapon from the Terran 
with such force that the Man skid- 
ded across the hold and slammed 
against the bulkhead screaming, 
clutching a bloody hand. 

“Hey, look!” Sidis said cheer- 
fully, holding the gun up, “His fin- 
ger’s still stuck in the guard!” Sidis 
dislodged the amputated member 
and tossed the gun up. “What do 
you want us to do with these nancies. 
Chief?” 

“Poke them in the ship’s lazar- 
et. Commander Hullwright’s coming 
with us for a little pleasant conver- 
sation, aren’t you, sir? We’ll go to 
the bridge where we can talk in pri- 
vacy and comfort.” 

Askor gathered up the guns, gave 
the best one to Roan, and handed 
the others to Poion and Sidis for 
safe keeping. 

Commander Hullwright’s ineffect- 
ual little eyes were frightened. 
“What,” he began, “what are 
you ...” 

“Now, now, be calm. Command- 
er,” Roan said. “If you play it 
cleverly, you may even live through 
this.”

R oan sat in the captain’s padded 
chair, gnawing a roasted leg of 
fowl and studying the charts of the 
Space Traffic Control Area sur- 
rounding Nyurth, the second planet 
out from Centaurus, and other 
charts showing the layout of the 
vast headquarters complex. 

“You know, Commander,” Roan 
said. “I’m impressed with the Im- 
perial Terran Navy after all. I’ll 
just want a few details from you 
so I can be even more impressed. 
Care for another piece of bird?” 
Hullwright snarled. Sidis cracked 
him across the shins with the power 
rifle. 

“Answer nice when the Cap’n 
speaks to you,” he admonished. 

“No, I don’t want a piece o’ bird, 
you pirate!” he roared. 

“Tell me about the defenses. 
Commander,” Roan said. 

“I’ll tell ye nothing, ye murder- 
ing mutinous cross-breed Geeks!” 
“Our captain objects to adjec- 
tives,” Poion said mildly, giving 
Hullwright a gentle but telling twist 
of the ear. “And I find your emo- 
tional radiation both primitive and 
appalling. Answer the captain cor- 
rectly and succinctly.” 

“I’d eat me own tongue first!” 
Roan tossed the chicken leg aside 
and began peeling a banana, “Umm. 
Now, about these charts. How many 
of the emplacements are operative 
— and which ones?” He held the 
chart for Hullwright to see. 

Hullwright was silent. Sidis jabbed 
him roughly with the end of the 
gun. 



“Ye think I’d betray me uniform, 
ye scum?” Hullwright snarled. 

“That’s right,” Roan said. “Un- 
less you’d rather die. One piece at 
a time.” 

“Ye wouldn’t dare lay a hand on 
me, ye filth! I’m an officer of the 
Imperial Terran Navy!” 

“I killed a captain once.”' Roan 
said. “It was just as easy as killing 
a Gook.” 

Hullwright tried to keep his de- 
fiant look in place, but the spirit 
had wilted from him. 

“Damn ye’r eyes,” he said, “ye 
won’t get through anyway. Untie me 
right hand and I’ll point them out 
to ye on the chart.” 

H ullwright sagged in the chair. 

His little eyes closed and he- 
rubbed his space eyebrows with his 
hand. Empty glasses and plates lit- 
tered the plotting board and chart 
table, the remains of meals brought 
up from the galley at the com- 
mander’s reluctant request, and 
passed in through the service slot. 

“I’ve told ye all I know,” Hull- 
wright said hoarsely. “Ye’ve sucked 
me brain* ’s dry as a mummy’s 
tongue.” 

“You’ve done very well. Com- 
mander,” Roan said. “Askor, what’s 
the fix for Planet Three?” 

“Twenty-seven million miles 
abaft our port beam, Cap’n.” 

“Fine. Now Commander, I’ve got 
just one more little favor to ask, 
and you’ve been so nice. Pass the 
word to your Second Officer to as- 
semble the crew on the boat deck 
in fatigues for calisthenics in exact- 
ly ten minutes.”

“Hah? What’s that?” 

Askor applied the butt of the 
rifle. “Jump, Terry!” 

After two more prods of increas- 
ing severity, Huilwrigjit complied. 
With the cold muzzle of Askor’s 
rifle against his left temple, his 
ragged voice sounded through the 
vessel. 

“And now, good-bye. Command- 
er,” Roan said. “Askor, you and 
Sidis take the commander to join 
his men. They’ll be in their skivvies 
and unarmed, so you shouldn’t have 
to kill many of them. Dump all 
but two kilotons of reaction mass 
from our lifeboat. Then load the 
commander and his men aboard and 
cast them off.” 

“That’s cold-blooded murder, ye 
swine!” A crack across bloody shins 
cut Hullwright off. 

“You’ll have enough fuel aboard 
to reach Centaurus Three. Accord- 
ing to your charts, it has a breath- 
able atmosphere. There are forty- 
three of you and the supplies and 
water should last you a couple 
months, if you’re not careless. And 
if I find you’ve been honest with me 
about the information you gave me. 
I’ll see that you’re picked up. 

“Wait a minute,” Hullwright said 
blurrily. “I just remembered. About 
that picket line, the outer one . .” 
The commander corrected a few 
errors he had made. Then Askor 
took him away, followed by Sidis 
with his toothy grin. 

A lone, Roan sat in the bridge and 
knew he was a fool. He could 
have gone on looting the universe, 
or set himself up for life on some 



pleasant planet, with never another 
care in the world. Instead, here he 
was alone with three Gooks, going in 
to face the Imperial Terran Navy. 

And why? 

I’m still looking for Terra, Roan 
thought. Poion says I’m looking for 
home and I have no home to find. 
Man has no home. Perhaps there is 
no Terra. But that’s something Poion 
wouldn’t know — and the Imperial 
Terran Navy might. They might 
know the truth of the story of the 
ancient Niss blockade of Terra. 

Roan thought of the dead Niss 
ship firing its last volley, and that 
made him think of Henry Dread. 
Even now he couldn’t remember 
Henry Dread without pain. He had 
had blood on his hands before, but 
Henry’s was the only blood that 
stained. 

Poion came in with his silent 
tread. “Let that memory die, my 
captain,” he said. “Gird yourself for 
the future.” 

Roan felt the boat lurch slightly. 
That would be the lifeboat kicking 
free. Askor and Sidis came back 
into the control deck in high good 
humor. Their laughter was like a 
cannon ball rolling over an iron 
grill. 

“That was cute, chief,” Sidis said. 
“The tub’s all yours. What are you 
going to do with it?” 

“First we’re going to scuttle her,” 
Roan said, smiling grimly at three 
astonished expressions. “Then we’re 
going to ride what’s left into ITN 
HQ on Nyuith.” 

“And after that?” Askor asked. 

“After that we start taking 
chances.”

I t tcx)k nine hours to burn a care- 
fully aligned series of holes 
through the bulkheads of the ITN 
destroyer, so arranged as to destroy 
food and water supplies and smash 
unimportant portions of the control 
system, while leaving intact the vital 
minimum of instruments and fuel 
reserves. 

The final punctures through the 
outer hull-plates were bored by Si- 
dis, cramped in a too-small ITN 
regulation vacuum suit, at points 
marked by tiny pilot-holes cut from 
within. When the job was complete, 
crude patches were rigged. The four- 
some gathered in the now sealed-off 
control deck, surrounded by heaps 
of supplies placed there before the 
work was begun. 

“Get the story straight,” Roan 
said. “We’re from an ITN detach- 
ment on Carolis. That’s far enough 
away they won’t know any better. 
We found this tub derelict, beyond 
the fourth from Centaurus, driving 
out-system at a half G. We boarded 
her and sealed off the leaks, restor- 
ed atmosphere to the conn deck, and 
headed her for her home station for 
salvage.” 

“What were we doing nosing 
around this . Sector?” Askor asked, 
levering the cap from a can of com- 
pressed quagle eggs. 

“We were lost,” Roan said. “And 
next time you get a yen for quagle 
eggs, go in the john. They smell like 
a corpse’s armpit.” Th^e were a 
few things the Minids ate Roan 
could never get used to. “We left 
our scout ship in orbit around fourth 



from Centaurus. We were out of 
supplies and almost out of fuel. 
When we first saw the Navy ship 
we thought we were being rescued. 
Then we found out it was a ghost 
ship. We’re distressed spacers — 
nothing more.” 

“We’ll be more distressed yet, 
when the ITN gets hold of us,”.. As- 
kor said. 

“I get distressed every time you 
open your ugly mouth,” Sidis said. 
“Why don’t you shut up and let the 
cap’n do the worrying?” 

“It’s a good forty-hour run into 
the Planetary Control Area,” Roan 
said. “We’ll stand watch two on and 
four off. Every half hour we trans- 
mit our mayday signal. We’ll keep 
our receivers open. I doubt that we’ll 
pick up anything, but if we do, ig- 
nore it.” 

“What if we hear an order to 
heave to?” 

“Our receivers are out. We keep 
going.” 

Roan keyed the Transmitter to 
the ITN distress channel. 

“ITN vessel Rage of Heaven, un- 
der salvage crew, calling ITN HQ 
at Nyurth,” he called. “We’re head- 
ed in-system on course for Nyurth; 
our position is . /’ 

A t the center of a box of four 
heavy destroyers which paced 
the damaged vessel at a distance of 
one hundred miles. Roan steered 
the scuttled and patched Rage of 
Heaven in past the tiny outer moon 
of Nyurth. He crossed the orbit of 
the massive inner moon and de- 
scended, braking now, into the up- 
per reaches of the deep atmosphere.

The escort moved in to fifty miles, 
then ten. On the screens, the tell- 
tales winked with the incoming 
pulses of long-range sensors aimed 
from the planetary surface nine hun- 
dred miles below. 

“They’re tracking us like we was 
a missile volley from a hostile super- 
D,” Sidis growled through his care- 
fully polished teeth. He was sharp- 
ening a new toothpick with a steel 
file. Sweat beaded his low forehead. 

“At least they’ve laid off hailing 
us,” Askor pointed out. “I thought 
maybe the bastards meant it when 
they gave us that final warning.” 

“Their emotions when we emerge 
from the ship should be fascinating,” 
Poion said, delicately whetting an 
even finer edge on his already razor- 
sharp stiletto. 

Sidis eyed the business end of his 



power gun and blew any possible 
dust out of it. Then he took out his 
whetstone and started honing his 
double-bladed Niss knife. 

“You know, Cap’n,” Askor said, 
“I dunno if it was a good idea, trick- 
ing us out in these Terry suits. A 
Gook ain’t a Terry, no matter how 
you slick him up.” 

“You’re honorary Terries,” Roan 
said. “Now shut up and follow my 
lead.” 

T he ship grounded clumsily at the 
extreme edge of the vast port 
complex. Roan watched on the 
screens as two of his escort settled 
in nearby, gun ports open and en- 
ergy projectors aimed. The others 
hovered a mile or two above. 

“They must think we got an army 
in here,” Askor said. 








The three crewmen looked at 
Roan. “Do we walk out there. Just 
like that?” 

“You know a better way?” Roan 
adjusted the set of the collar of his 
ITN uniform, hitched his gun belt 
to center the buckle. 

“No weapons out,” he said. “We 
can’t buck the whole Imperial Ter- 
ran Navy. Right now all we’ve got 
is my brains. So keep your traps 
shut.” " 

“Well,” Askor said, eyeing the 
bright sky, “it’s as good a day as 
any to take a swig from the Hell- 
horn.” 



Roan led the way down the land- 
ing ramp, squinting at bright sun- 
shine, sniffing the alien scent of 
fresh air. Across the field, an offi- 
cial, uniformed contingent of the 
Imperial Terr an Navy was drawn 
up in a rank to greet him. Their 
shoulder insignia glittered in the sun, 
and their metal belts shone. Striding 
at the head of his hulking compan- 
ions, Roan snapped over liis shoul- 
der: 

“If one of you thugs disgraces me. 
I’ll have his guts an inch at a time.” 
The ranked Terrans stood rigidly 
waiting, and Roan admired their 



“I begin to sense their emotions.” precise formation, their disciplined

mixture of curiosity and excitement hated himself because he wished he

Then he was closer, and he saw 
they were not all the same height, 
as they had appeared to be, but 
were artfully arranged in graduated 
rows with the tallest on the right 
and the near-midgets at the far end. 
His step alnK)st faltered, but he went 
on, seeing the alien faces now, the 
wrong-colored eyes under the regu- 
lation helmets, the queer-colored 
skin of wrists showing above six- 
fingered and four-fingered gloves, 
the slashes in polished boots to ease 
wide, webbed feet, the misshapen 
bodies that bulged under the uni- 
forms^ of glory. 

At twenty feet, he barked the 
order to halt. A heavy body bump- 
ed him from behind. He whirled, 
bellowed at the trio who were spread^ 
ing out, gaping at the strangers. 

“Back in line there, you bone- 
skulled sons of one-legged joy-girls!” 

He turned again, saluted stiffly as 
a short, pink-faced Terran came up, 
casually returning Roan’s greeting 
with a wave of a soft hand. He was 
wearing the insignia of a Lieutenant 
Commander, and he tucked a short 
swagger stick under his arm, glanced 
past Roan at his crew, wiped his 
nose with a forefinger. 

“Commodore Quex would like to 
welcome you and your men and 
requests the honor of your presence 
at Imperial Naval Headquarters at 
your earliest convenience,” he said 
in a high, melodious voice. A civiliz- 
ed voice. 

Roan nodded, staring at the 
strange Terran’s face. 

There were two heavy-lidded eyes 
— pale blue. Roan noted, with a 
small lift of excitement — a blob of 



a nose, a puckered mouth, folds of 
fat under the small chin. For so.me 
reason it reminded Roan of a baby 
Fustian, before its shell grew. It 
didn’t look like the kind of face 
Roan had pictured conquering a gal- 
axy. But he concealed his disap- 
pointment and: ‘motioned his crew to 
follow him as the Terran led the 
way across the field. 

4 4TT7hat do you get from them 
▼ ^ up close, Poion?” Roan 
asked softly as they marched behind 
the Terran officer, flanked by a 
squad of Men. 

“Some sort of fear, oddly enough, 
Poion said. 

“Fear? Of four ragged spacemen?” 

“Not exactly of us. But that is 
the emotion I read.” 

The Headquarters of the ITN was 
a craggy many-towered palace built 
ages before by a long-dead prince of 
a vanished dynasty. It loomed like 
a colossus over the tumbled mud 
houses of the village. A vast green 
window like a cyclopean eye cast 
back brilliant viridian reflections as 
Roan and his crew marched in under 
the crumbling walls along a wide 
marble walkway, went up wide steps 
flanked by immaculate conical trees 
of dark green set among plants with 
tiny violet blossoms. It was faintly, 
sadly reminiscent of the garden on 
Aldo Cerise. 

Inside, the sun glowed in long 
rectangles along the echoing floor 
of a wide, high room. Terries in 
fitted tunics of Navy blue stood at 
rigid attention by elongated doors 
at the sides of the room. Above, a 
vaulted ceiling arched up into sha- 



130 



IF 




dows where gold and blue mosaics 
caught occasional sun gleams among 
masses of hanging brass carvings, all 
polished, which dangled like ear- 
rings from a hundred peaked cor- 
ners, clanging as the wind moved 
them. They went under a vast arch 
of enameled brass, across a wide 
floor of gleaming brass plates. Far 
up among dark rafters, echoes of 
more brass clashed softly. 

As the men marched by. Geek 
slaves prostrated themselves. They 
were lean, ribby, deep-eyed crea- 
tures, with vestigial scales across 
high shoulders, long, finger-toed feet 
and draggled manes of lank hair 
along their prominent spines. They 
wore only loin cloths in spite of the 
chill, and some of them trembled 
violently as Roan looked at them. 
From cold — or fear. 

The small Terran officer trotted 
ahead, disappeared through high 
doors with a sign for Roan to wait. 
His men clustered close behind him, 
drawn together and suddenly alert, 
almost disciplined. 

“We could jump ’em now,” As- 
kor growled. “I get jumpy just wait- 
ing.” 

“There is a certain pleasure in the 
experience of mortal suspense,” Poi- 
on said philosophically. “In such 
a moment the current of life runs 
deep and swift.” 

“You’ll actually enjoy dying, you 
poetic bastard,” Askor grunted. 

Roan hissed at his men as they 
began to mutter. Waiting came hard 
to them. But there was no need to 
worry about them. They could smell 
danger at half a parsec — and it 
was an odor they were fond of. 



XXXI 

R oan’s guide reappeared and 
beckoned to him. 

“Wait here,” Roan said to his 
men, “and don’t shoot anybody be- 
fore I get back!” He followed 
through the bossed, agate-studded 
door into a shadowed, higji-vaulted 
room in which magnificence hung 
like rotted velvet dra{>es. A spider- 
lean man in a rank-ehcnisted uni- 
form rose from behind a desk like 
a beached freighter. He offered a 
bony hand. Roan took it, and felt 
the stitching along the fingers where 
the webbing had been removed. He 
had a wide mouth and a strange, 
small chin. His ears were odd, and 
at close range Roan could see that 
they were edged with pink scar tis- 
sue. 

“I am Commodore Quex,” the 
man said in a soft, almost feminine 
voice. He was slight, delicately bon- 
ed, but the cruelty in the slits of his 
eyes was that of a wolf, not of a 
cat. 

Behind Roan, the fat Terran sa- 
luted and went out and the door 
closed behind him. 

“I’m Roan Cornay,” Roan said. 
“Lieutenant Cornay,” he added. 

“Ah, yes. From Corilis. What a 
pleasure to welcome you, ah. Lieu- 
tenant.” A finger like a parchment- 
wrapped bone brushed at a red- 
edged eye. At close range. Roan 
could see a whitish crust at the cor- 
ners of the puckered mouth. An un- 
pleasant odor hung about the old 
man. He settled back into his chair, 
snapped his fingers. Something mov- 
ed in the shadows, and Roan saw 



EARTHBLOOD 



131 




that it was a slave, face down on 
the thick, moldy carpet. It rose and 
scuttled to swing a heavy chair 
around for Roan to sit in. 

The commodore glanced at a 
paper before him, then looked at 
Roan, his hand hovering near his 
eye. “Your ship, ah, Navy 39643- 
G4. Our records — ” 

“I captured her. After Warlock 
was lost.” 

“Ah, yes. So you said. Hmmm. 
Warlock was a valuable vessel. I 
don’t believe your reports made it 
clear precisely how she was lost.” 
“In action.” Roan paused, think- 
ing of what he had been about to 
say about the Niss ship, and de- 
ciding quite suddenly not to say 
it. He let the sentence hang. 

Quex was looking thoughtful. 
“Surprising . and fortunate that 
you were able to obtain a replace- 
ment. And Captain Dread was lost 
as well?” The old voice was a purr. 
Roan felt tension creep along the 
back of his neck. He shifted in his 
chair so as to keep the door in view. 
“That’s ri^t,” he said. 

“And before his, ah, death, he 
tendered you your appointment?” 
The red eye peered past the finger 
at Roan. 

^ “Four years ago.” 

“Umnun. And how did you hap- 
pen to enter into your, ah, assoc- 
iation with Dread?” 

“He took me from a ship he 
captured.” 

Quex sucked in his dry lips. “An- 
other naval unit?” he asked sharp- 

ly- 

“No; ft was a travelling show. I 
was one of the Freaks.” 



“You were a captive of non-Shu- 
mans?” Quex was digging at his ear 
now, angrily. 

“Not really. I was, at first, but — ” 

Quex leaned forward. “You lived 
among them willingly?” There was 
an edge on his voice like a saw. 

“They treated me well enough. 
I had good quarters and plenty of 
food.” 

“Beware of Geeks bearing gifts,” 
Quex said flatly. He leaned back, 
his thin fingers on the edge of the 
table. 

“And what is your andestry, Cor- 
ney? If you don’t mind my asking.” 
His voice indicated that he didn’t 
care whether Roan minded or not. 

R oan opened his mouth to say 
that he was genuine Terrestrial 
strain, but he heard himself say- 
ing, “I’m not sure. I was adopted. 
My folks didn’t talk about it much.” 
“Mmmm. To be sure,” Quex 
murmured meaninglessly. He poked 
at the papers on his desk. “About 
your cargo. Iridion. Gold. Gem 
stones. Various heavy metals.” He 
looked up with a smile like a false- 
face. “Some error in transmission, 
I assume.” 

“It’s all aboard my ship. Her 
holds are crammed with the stuff. 
I’ll be obliged if you’ll have it off- 
loaded. I need the space for ammu- 
nition and stores. Who do I see 
about provisioning?” 

Quex’s mouth was open, showing 
inflamed gums and the tip of a 
white tongue. 

“Provisioning? For what?” 

“For my next cruise. My new as- 
signment.” 



132 



IF 




“Ah, of course.” Quex showed the 
false face again. His finger was back 
at his eye. “But we can discuss these 
details later. I’ve laid on a dinner in 
your honor tonight. You’ll want to 
prepare. Real Terran fare again, 
eh?” 

“I take it most of the fleet is out 
on space duty now?” Roan said. 

“Why do you say that?” Quex 
shot a darting look. 

“I only saw half a dozen ships 
at the port. Some of them seemed 
to be half dismantled. How big a 
force does Alpha HQ command?” 
Quex lifted the paper from his 
desk and dropped it again. “Ah, an 
extensive force, Cornay. Quite ex- 
tensive. Rather extensive.” 

“You have other bases here on- 
world?” 

“Oh, ah, assuredly. Lieutenant. 
Why,” Quex waved a hand toward 
the draped window. “You didn‘t im- 
agine these few rusting hulks were 
our entire fleet?” He curved his 
puckered lips in a smile that crin- 
kled the cruelty lines around his 
eyes. “Most amusing. Most. But — ” 
he rose — “I suggest we allow these 
matters to wait until after our cele- 
bration of your happy return.” 

Roan stood. “Certainly, sir. But 
I’d like to ask when the counter-at- 
tack is planned. I want to know how 
to set up my cruise.” 

“Counter-attack?” Quex gaped. 
“The massive offensive in force 
against the.Niss. How many of them 
are there? Where have they set up 
their headquarters? What — ” 

The commodore held up two 
quivering hands. “Cornay, need I 
remind you that all this is highly 



classified?” He shot a lOok at the 
nearest slave, crouched against the 
floor. 

“Oh.” Roan glanced at the slave. 
“I didn’t think . .” 

Quex rounded the desk. “Not 
that we have any trouble with our 
slaves. They know their place, don’t 
they, old one?” 

He kicked the slave hard in the 
ribs. It grunted and glanced up with 
an almost human smile,* then stared 
at the floor again. 

“Still, I shall have to dispose of 
this fellow now. Pity in a way. He's 
been with me for twenty years and 
is well trained. But getting old. A!i, 
well.” Quex took Roan’s elbow, 
guided him toward the door. “Until 
tonight, then?” 

“What about my crew?” 

“Your crew. Of course. Do briMf^ 
them along. Yes. Capital idt'a. 
Your entire crew, mind you. How 
many did you say there were?” 
“Just the four of us,” Roan said. 
“At second Moonrise then, Cor- 
nay. Don’t be late.” 

“We’ll be there,” Roan said. 

V ast grins broke across battered 
faces as Roan rejoined his 

crew. 

“Glad to see you. Boss,” Asknr 
said. “We was about to come in 
after you.” 

“Relax. I’ll call the plays,” Roan 
said. 

A small, neat Terry with an ele- 
gant walk flicked ashes from a dope 
stick, came toward Roan and his 
men. The guard officer came to at- 
tention. 

“That will do, Piitertek,” the new- 



EARTHBLOOD 



133 




comer said gently. He looked Roan 
over, smiling faintly, glanced at the 
others. 

“But, sir . the guard protest- 
ed. 

“And your watchdogs, too,” the 
dandy said. He was carefully dressed 
in immaculate blue pK)lyon with sil- 
ver corded shoulderboards bearing 
the winged insignia of a captain. 
His blond, rigidly waved hair shone 
with oil and he touched it with pol- 
ished fingernails. His perfume re- 
minded Roan distantly of Stellaraire. 

“My name is Trishinist,” he said 
with a small flourish of one mani- 
cured hand. “Sorry about the recep- 
tion. These commissioned peasants 
— no finesse. Perhaps you’d like a 
bite to eat and then we can have a 
little chat?” 

“My men are hungry, too,” Roan 
said. “They never seem to get in- 
vited anywhere.” 

“The enlisted men’s mess is — ” 

“They’re officers.” 

“My apKxlogies. Of course.” Cap- 
tain Trishinist led the way along a 
side corridor, chatting easily about 
the weather, the servant problem, 
the inadequacies of the mess cusine. 

The dining room was quiet with 
deep rugs and moss green drapes and 
still, intricate chandeliers. Waiters 
sprang forward to draw out chairs 
at a long, white-linened table. 

Askor and Sidis sat down awk- 
wardly, then relaxed and grinned 
at each other. 

Trishinist murmured an order to 
a servitor, waited and turned con- 
tentedly to the table as the waiter 
brought a loaded tray. 

“Champagne and honeydew,” 



Trishinist said as Roan’s men eyed 
the frosted bottle and the breakable- 
looking glasses. “I hope you find it 
adequate.” 

Askor reached out and helped 
himself to half a melon from the 
tray as the waiter passed and took 
a vast bite. 

“Hey,” he said, chewing juicily, 
“Pretty good. But the skin’s kinda 
tough.” 

“Wipe your chin,” Roan said 
more than a little annoyed. 

Askor used his sleeve. “Sorry,” 
he muttered. Sidis had plucked the 
bottle from the tray and rapped it 
on the edge of the table to knock 
the top off. He jumped to his feet, 
suddenly startled, as the wine foamed 
out. 

“Uh-oh,” he said. “This one’s went 
to the bad.” 

A waiter rescued the bottle with 
an impassive face, mopped up the 
wine. Poion took the bottle, sniffed 
it, then took a swig from the broken 
neck. 

“An interesting drink,” he said. 
“Effervescent, like the human mind. 
And worth a brief sonnet.” 

“What’s the matter with you?” 
Roan snapped. “Offer the captain 
a drink.” 

Poion blushed and pushed the 
bottle along to Trishinist, who waved 
it away with a smile. 

Roan picked up his melon and 
took a bite. “Good,” he said around 
a mouthful of melon. 

Trishinist’s hand hovered over a 
spoon. TTien he picked up his melon 
with delicate fingertips and nibbled 
its edges. “So glad you enjoy it,” he 
said.

W aiters cleared away the last 
of the dishes and filled glasses 
with mysterious-smelling brandy. 
Sidis slapped his belly and belched. 
“A great feed,” he said. 

Askor plied a fingernail on a 
back tooth. “First real Terry chow 
I ever had,” he co<mmented. “Un- 
less you want to count — ” 

“Thank you. Captain,” Roan cut 
him off hurriedly. “It was a good 
breakfast.” 

Trishinist offered dope-sticks all 
around and lit up as the waiters 
cleared the last of the dishes. 

“Now, about Rage of Heaven** 
Tris<hinist said. “You say you found 
her abandoned. May I ask how it 
happened that you were cruising in 
this area?” 

Roan said carefully: “We heard 
there were inhabited worlds in this 
area. New markets. My ship was 
blasted by a time mine and we 
were drifting when we spotted the 
cruiser.” 

“You knew this was ITN con- 
trolled space?” 

“Yes.” Roan was watching Trish- 
inist’s face carefully. He wished 
Poion could tell him what Trishin- 
ist was feeling. It would help. 

“And ycAi encountered the dere- 
lict where?” 

Roan repeated the coordinates of 
the imaginary rendezvous beyond 
fourth Centaurus. 

Trishinist glanced around; the 
doors were closed, now and the 
waiters gone. He leaned across the 
table and his languid expression 
was gone. So were thousands of 



years of culture. It was as though 
suddenly all the waves went out of 
his hair. 

“You’re early,” he hissed. “Four 
months ahead of schedule.” 

R oan sat perfectly still, holding 
the interested smile in place. 
“As it happens, we’re ready here,” 
Trishinist went on, licking his lips. 
“But I dislike Elan’s imprecision. If 
we’re going to be working togeth- 
er — ” 

“Hey. chief,” Sidis began. 
“Hush,” Poion murmured. 
Trishinist squinted at the three 
crewmen. “What about these?” he 
asked Roan. 

“They do what I say,” Roan said. 
Poion smiled. “It is true,” he 
said. 

Trishinist frowned. “I had ex- 
pected rather more ... ah ... re- 
presentative individuals.” 

“They’re as representative as I 
need them to be,” Roan said. 

“You have your identification?” 
Roan reached inside his tunic, 
brought out an ITN identification 
disk on a chain, handed it across. 
Trishinist looked at it carefully. 

“Endor,” he murmured. “Elan’s 
never mentioned your name to me 
Captain.” 

“No doubt.” Roan said. 

“Blan is proposing no changes in 
the scheme at this date, I trust?” 
Trishinist said sharply. “I’ve ful- 
filled my part of the arrangement. 
I assume he’s done as well.” 

“You see me here,” Roan said. 
“Where are his squadrons now?” 
“They’re in position.” Roan im- 
provised. 



EARTHBLOOD

“Is he prepared to move at once?” 
Roan frowned. “That depends on 
you,” he said. 

“On mer 

“Of course. WeTe early. Yon ‘ 
you’re ready, Captain. Just wlnal do 
you mean by that? In detail.” 
Trisihinist’s jaw muscles were 
tensed up. “I told you, I’ve complied 
with our agreement in every re- 
spect.” 

“I can’t work with you if you re- 
fuse to tell me anything. I want to 
know just how ready you are.” 
Trishinist relaxed his jaw muscles 
with a visible effort. “The organ- 
ization among the rank and file is 
now over the eighty per cent figure. 
Sixty-four of the ninety-eight senior 
officers are aligned with us. Over 
ninety per cent of the junior corps. 
Our men control communications 
and three of the five major supply 
depots 

Roan listened, taking occasional 
sips from his glass. Askor and Sidis 
sat, mouths slightly open, listening. 
Poion was smiling behind his hand. 
But Roan didn’t kick him because 
it took some practice before a 
stranger could tell Poion was smil- 
ing. 

“The units on maneuvers are, of 
course, those including high con- 
centrations of unreliables,” Trishin- 
ist concluded. **The base garrison 
has been carefully selected over the 
past three years and can be count- 
ed on absolutely. Now, what of 
your group?” 

“We’re ready,” Roan said. 

“At full strength?” 

“I have triple the number of 
volunteers I expected.” 



“Excellent!” Trishinist pursed his 
lips. “How soon can you be in jump- 
off position?” 

“We’re already in position.” 
“You mean . you mean that 
literally?” The captain moved un- 
easily in his chair. 

“Absolutely.” 

“Certainly you don’t mean — to- 
day?” 

Roan put both hands palms down 
on the table. “Now,”, he said, be- 
cause all this was having such an 
extraordinary effect on Trishinist. 

T rishinist’s face seemed to fall 
apart as a look of comprehen- 
sion and shock came over it. Sweat 
popped out on his forehead and his 
eyes went to Sidis, who was polish- 
ing his teeth, and Askor who was 
just sitting, and Poion who all of a 
sudden began to look as though 
there was something important 
about him. 

“Oh, I see now,” Trishinist said. 
“I see why you brought them. I 
...” A sick expression passed over 
his eyes — “you really think it’s nec- 
sesary to go that far.” 

“\^at’s the alternative?” Roan 
asked steadily. 

“You’re right, of course. Still . 
he is Pure Strain.” 

Roan stood up. “We’ve spent 
enough time talking about it. I’d 
like to meet him now.” 

“Meet . .” Trishinist looked al- 
most wild for a moment. “Oh . .” 
He relaxed. “Just to . ah . 
assess him, of course.” 

“Of course.” 

“Very well.” Trishinist rose. 
“Things are moving a trifle rapidly

for me. But you’re right. There’s no 
need to delay.” 

At the door he hesitated, glancing 
at Askor, Sidis and Poion. 

“Ah . which one?” 

Sidis grinned his jagged grin, 
Trishinist shuddered and went on 
out into the hall. 

Guards in bright-plated helmets 
snapped to attention as Captain 
Trishinist halted Roan and his men 
at a massive carved door. 

“I’ll introduce you as a new ar- 
rival from one of the Outer Towns,” 
he said to Roan. “He likes to meet 
the new recruits. There are so few 
these days. The other will wait, of 
course.” 

Askor looked at Roan; Roan 
nodded. “Stay here,” he said. “Don’t 
wander off looking for liquor.” 

“Gee, Boss,” Sidis said. 

Trishinist opened the door; Roan 
followed him into an ivory-walled 
anteroom ornamented with a pale 
blue floral cornice. A harried-look- 
ing staff lieutenant came in from 
the room beyond, exchanged quick 
words with the captain, then mo- 
tioned them through the arched 
way. 

The room was wide, silent, deep- 
carpeted in dusty blue, with light 
curtains filtering the yellow light 
from tall windows. There were deep 
chairs, cabinets and bookshelves of 
rioh-polished wood, and a vast desk 
behind which an ancient Man with 
snow-white hair sat, his gnarled 
hands gripping the arms of his mas- 
sive chair. 

“Good morning. Admiral Star- 
bird,” Trishinist said. “I’ve brought 
a caller.” 



S tarbird waved Trishinist and the 
aide from the room, indicated a 
chair, sat studying Roan’s face in 
silence. 

“Have I not met you somewhere, 
once, young Man?” His voice was 
the rumble of subterran^n waters. 

“I don’t think so, sir,” Roan said. 
He was staring at the other’s lined 
face. He had never seen an old 
Man before, and he was remember- 
ing Henry Dread and the expression, 
at once that of the hunter and the 
hunted, that Henry had worn and 
that the old man had too. 

“That fellow,” Starbird jerked his 
head toward the door through which 
Trishinist had gone. “He a friend 
of yours?” 

“I just met him today.” 

“Vicious little ferret,” Starbird 
said. “He’s up to something. Thinks 
I don’t know. Has his picked men 
all over my headquarters. But it 
doesn’t matter. No guts. That’s his 
trouble. Oh, yes, he’ll plan; he’ll talk. 
But there’s no steel in the man.” 
The Admiral’s eyes were on Roan’s 
face, as though searching for a clue 
to something. 

“From the Outer Towns, eh? 
What were your parents like?” 

“I don’t know, sir. I was raised 
by foster parents.” 

“And you want to fight the en- 
emies of Imperial Terra.” 

“I’ve thought about it.” 

“If I were young again,” Starbird 
said with sudden vigor. His fingers 
twitched on the chair arms. “I re- 
member my first day. Ah, those 
were great times, young man! There

was someihing in the air, a feeling 
of things to be done, goals to strive 
for . He sat, looking beyond 
Roan into the past. 

“My father was on fleet duty 
then,” he went on talking to himself 
now, communing with the dead. 
“He commanded a five kilo^onncr, 
the old Zealot; she was lost off 
Pluto on a routine recon run, 
gunned out of space by the Niss. 
Three hundred years ago that must 
he now. I was just a lad, then, on 
border duty in the north. I was to 
have been with him on his next 
sweep. He was a bold one; too bold. 
Who else would penetrate all the 
way to Sol’s edge? Nobody!” Star- 
bird pounded his chair-arm and 
looked at Roan. “None of these 
sniveling garrison sailors you see 
disgracing the uniform today! 
They’re a cruel lot, young man! 
And gutless!” 

Roan sat silently, waiting. 

“Revenge,” Starbird said. “I swore 
I’d have it! But no suicide run, by 
God! Plenty of smirks and snickers 
thrown my way. All talk, they said. 
Talk! But I wasn’t jumping off half- 
ready. I needed the rank first. Then 
reorganization, weeding out the cor- 
ruption, the twisted element that was 
choking the service like Venusian 
tangle- weed! Measure a man’s genes 
instead of his guts, that was their 
way! Damn his genes! It’s the dream 
that make a man, not the number 
of his toes!” 

S tarbird fell silent, his face twitch- 
ing with the pain of old mem- 
ories. 

“I had my star at last,” he said 



suddenly. “I put my plan before the 
general staff. The plan I’d worked 
out over all those years. Five hun- 
dred ships of the line, a million 
picked men. We were to move in 
two echelons, blast our way past 
the Niss picket lines beyond Pluto, 
strike with our full power all the 
way in past the Neptune and Jupiter 
orbits. Then — when they massed to 
meet us — split! Our probes had 
given us plenty of information on 
the Niss defensive patterns! I anal- 
yzed their data, and ^ saw the an- 
swer: We’d split beyond Mars, break 
up into two hundred and fifty pairs, 
and carry a running fight right in 
past Luna. Then regroup in a beau- 
tiful maneuver I’d worked out as 
carefully as a ballet — and hit the 
Niss inner blockade line with a 
spearhead that could blast its way 
through the walls of Hell!” The old 
Man’s eyes blazed with a fierce light; 
then he let out a long breath and 
leaned back. He raised his hands, 
let them fall. 

“They laughed at me,” he said 
flatly. “We weren’t ready, they said. 
The Niss were too powerful, we 
didn’t have the firepower to stand 
against them. Wait, they said. Wait!” 
He sighed. “That was almost two 
hundred years ago. We’re still wait- 
ing. And four lights away, the Niss 
blockade of Terra still stands!” 

Roan was sitting bolt upright. 
“Terra?” he said. 

“Ah, the name still has magic for 
you, does it lad?” 

“Only four lights from here?” 

Starbird nodded. “Sol’s her sun. 
The third planet. The double world. 
Terra the Fair. Locked up behind a

wall of Niss!” Starbird’s fist 
slammed the desk. “I’ll never live 
now to see my plan used! We wait- 
ed too long; soniehow, the fire that 
We carried died while we talked — 
and the dream died with it.” 

Roan sat forward in his chair. 
“Admiral, you said you weren’t wor- 
ried about Trishinist. What if he 
had outside help?” 

Starbird's eyes narrowed. “What 
outside help?” 

“A man named Blan.” 

“Blan? That warped imp out of 
Hades? Is he still alive?” 

“His forces are due here in four 
months.” 

Starbird was sitting erect now, 
the force back in his voice. “How 
do you know this, lad?” 

“Trishinist mistook me for Bran’s 
emissary. He’s ready to make his 
move now. Today. He thinks one of 
my crew is assigned to assassinate 
you. I’m here now to size you up 
for the killer.” 

Starbird rose and walked across 
to the door. He was a tall, once- 
powerful man with square, bony 
shoulders and lean hips. He flipped 
a lock, threw a wall switch that 
snicked locks on outer doors. He 
came back and sat behind the desk. 

“All right, young fellow. Maybe 
you’d better tell me all you know 
about this plot.” 

Ci'T^hat’s as much as I was able 
A to get out of him,” Roan 
said. “With half the men backing 
him, he’s in a strong position, even 
without Blan’s reinforcements.” 
Starbird stroked the side of his 
jaw thoughtfully. “That timetable 



suits me very well. Let Trishinist go 
ahead with his plans. When he dis- 
covers his allies are missing, he’ll 
collapse.” 

“I can’t stay much longer, sir.” 
Roan got to his feet. “Trishinist will 
begin to suspect something. What 
do you want me to do?” 

Admiral Starbird thumbed his 
chin. “When’s the assassination 
scheduled?” 

“Tonight, after the banquet.” 
“Make it late. I’ll be ready. Just 
follow my lead. In the meantime, 
arm yourself. How many men do 
you have with you that you can 
trust?” 

“Three:” 

Starbird nodded a smile was grow- 
ing on his seamed face. His hand 
slammed the table. “Young fellow 
— what was your name again?” 
“Roan. Roan Comay.” 

Starbird was cackling. ‘Terra ex- 
cites you, does it?” The old man 
turned to a wall safe, punched keys 
with trembling fingers. The door 
swung open and he took out a sheaf 
of many-times-folded papers. 

“My attack plan,” he said. ‘The 
ships are ready — over four hundred 
of them, in concealed docks on the 
other side of the planet! I’ve kept 
them ready, hoping. I needed a lead- 
er, Mister Cornay. Trishinist has 
supplied the men. Let him try his 
coup! Let him send his killer to me! 
Then, when he comes along a little 
later to see for himself. I’ll be sitting 
here, laughing at him! And the or- 
ders will be waiting! I have a few 
loyal officers; they’ll command the 
five squadrons of the flotilla. And 
you, lad! You’ll take command as

acting Admiral of the Fleet! Do 
you understand?” 

“You’d trust me, Admiral? You 
don’t even know me.” 

“I’ve known many men in my 
years, boy. I can judge a fighting 
man when I see one. Will you do 
it?” 

“That’s what I came here for,” 
Roan said softly. “That’s what I’ve 
lived the last thirteen years of my 
life for.” 

XXXIV 

R oan’s thugs clustered about him 
in the windy bronze-and-mos- 
aic hallway outside the Grand Din- 
ing Chamber. They were splendid in 
new clothes of bright-colored silky 
cloth spangled over with beads and 
ornaments of glass and polished 
copper, and they smelled incongru- 
ously of flowers. 

“Keep your guns out of sight,” 
Roan ordered. “Keep your hands off 
the females and don’t kick the 
slaves. That’s a privilege we’ll leave 
to our hosts. No rough stuff unless 
I give the word, no matter what hap- 
pens. And any man that drinks so 
much he can’t shoot straight will de- 
serve whatever he gets.” He settled 
his palm-sized power gun against his 
stomach under the wide scarlet 
cummerbund that had been wound 
around him by his assigned slaves 
in the dust-covered splendor of his 
quarters. 

“Let’s go,” he said and pushed 
through the high mother-of-pearl in- 
laid doors. The clang and thump of 
noise-makers burst out; dancing girls 
'sprang into motion, whirled forward 



strewing flower petals. A thousand 
tiny colored lights gleamed from 
chandeliers and winked from tiny 
fountains that sparkled on long 
tables spread with dazzling white 
cloths almost hidden under gleam- 
ing plates, polished eating tools, 
slender glasses as fragile as first 
love. There were hundreds of Ter- 
rans seated at the table, and they 
rose, clapping their hands. Com- 
modore Quex came forward, his 
eyes, set at the extreme edges of his 
face, flicking over Roan and past 
him at his crew. He took Roan’s arm 
and tugged him toward the nearest 
table. “You’ll sit with me at the 
head table, of course.” 

Roan held back without seeming 
to. “What about my men?” 

“Oh, they’ll be well taken care 
of.” Quex smiled. He kept his upper 
lip pulled down to cover his teeth, 
but Roan caught a glimpse of wide- 
ly spaced points. A crowd of hu- 
manoid females with slender bodies 
and immense eyes and huge bare 
breasts were crowding around the 
men, taking their arms possessively, 
giggling up into surprised Gook 
faces that broke into vast, bristly, 
snaggle-toothed smiles. 

“Belay that.” Roan snapped. 
“You men will sit with me — or I’ll 
sit with them,” he amended, turning 
back to Quex. “I have to keep an 
eye on them,” he explained. 

“Ah, but yes, as you wish. Lieu- 
tenant.” Quex dithered for a mo- 
ment, then signalled, and crouching 
slaves darted in, shuffled chairs and 
place settings about. Roan took the 
deep armchair Quex waved him to 
and looked around.

“Where’s the admiral?” 

“He is unfortunately indisposed,” 
Quex toed a slave aside and took 
the chair oppKJsite Roan. “Chavig- 
ney ’85 or Beel Vat?” he inquired 
brightly. 

“Chavigney ’85,” Roan said, be- 
cause he’d heard of it. “Indisposed 
how?” 

“Admiral Starbird is getting on. 
He can’t stand much . excite- 
ment,” Quex showed his pointed 
teeth again and watched the slave 
pour ruby liquid into goblets. He 
picked his up, flicked a libation on 
the marble floor and nosed his 
glass. Roan drained his and thrust 
it out for a refill. No doubt the 
Chavigney ’85 had a magnificent 
bouquet, but at the moment he 
didn’t care. 

Q uex was staring at him; he re- 
membered his smile when 
Roan looked at him: “I don’t be- 
lieve I’ve ever seen hair just like 
yours before,” he said. “Quite . 
ah . striking.” 

“We all have our little peculiar- 
ities,” Roan said shortly, and let 
his eyes rest on Quex’s. They seemed 
to sit at the comers of his head 
and bulge. 

“No offense,” Quex said. “One 
sees a mew face so seldom.” 

“How many Terrans are there 
here at HQ?” Roan asked, glancing 
at the obvious Gooks along . the 
table. 

Something touched his shoulder. 
Mis hand went to his gun; and then 
there was a choking cloud of per- 
fume and a lithe, blue-trimmed girl 
was sitting on his lap. She had soft. 




EARTH&LOOD 



141 



round breasts with blue-dyed tips 
that poked through her beads, and 
she squirmed up against Roan’s 
chest and nudged his wine-glass 
against his lips. She looked a little 
like Stellaraire. For an instant Roan 
felt a lost emotion clutch at him, 
but he took the glass and put it 
firmly on the table and palmed the 
female gently from him. 

“Stand over there,” he said stern- 
ly. “If I need anything, I’ll call 
you.” 

The girl looked stricken, and then 
she looked at Quex and shrank back. 
The commodore slapped his hands 
sharply together, and the girl turned 
and was gone. 

“I don’t want her to get in any 
trouble,” Roan started. “It was 
just — ” 

Quex hissed. The points of his 
teeth showed plainly now. “We do 
our best with our Geeks,” he said. 
“But they are so abysmally stupid.” 

Slaves came with the food then. 
It was marvelous, and Roan forgot 
his problems for the moment, savor- 
ing the first real Terran-style cook- 
ing he had ever tasted. The wine 
was good too, and Roan had to force 
himself to sip it carefully. Along 
the table, his men spooned in the 
delicacies, and then when they grew 
impatient with the small bites, used 
their hands. Their girls kept up a 
constant shrill giggling, slopping 
wine against big alien teeth, spilling 
it down across stubbled jaws. Beside 
Quex^ Askor took a glass from his 
neighbor’s girl’s hand and poured 
the contents down his girl’s throat. 
She choked and sputtered, and As- 
kor caught Roan’s eye and winked. 



The noisemakers kept up their 
cacaphony. Roan watched them, ar- 
ranged behind a screen of bushy 
potted plants sawing and pumping 
and puffing at the gleaming, com- 
plicated noisemakers. 

“You like music?” Quex asked, 
leaning across the table. There were 
purple, juicy stains at the corners 
of his mouth and his eyes bugged 
more than ever. He had loosened his 
collar, and Roan saw red scars down 
the sides of his neck where some- 
thing had been surgically removed. 

“I don’t know,” Roan said, be- 
cause he had never heard the word 
before. “Is it something to eat?” 

“The sounds,” Quex said. He 
waved a hand at the orchestra, 
bleating and shrilling in the corner 
behind their screen of foliage. 

“It’s all right, I suppose,” Roan 
said. “Back in the ’zoo, they were 
louder.” 

“You want it louder?” 

“I remember a sound I heard 
once,” Roan said, thinking quite 
suddenly of the deserted park in the 
Terr an city on Aldo Cerise. “Real 
Terran sounds. Pretty sounds.” He 
was feeling the wine, he realized. He 
took a deep breath and sat up 
straighter, and felt for his gun with 
his fingertips. 

“Terry music?” Quex clapped his 
hands and a slave popped up and 
leaned close to get Quex’s instruc- 
tions, then slipped away. 

R oan glanced at his men. They 
were still chewing with their 
mouths open, reaching across each 
other’s plates for juicy gobbets al- 
most out of reach, wiping thick fin- 



142 



IF 




geis on now-greasy silks. Henry 
Dread had picked his Gooks for 
size, not beauty, Roan was thinking, 
when he became aware of a sound 
penetrating the bellowed talk and 
laughter. It was an elfin horn, pick- 
ing its way slowly above the uproar. 
Then it was joined by other sounds, 
deep and commanding, like the 
tramp of marching armies, and now 
the horns darted and flickered like 
the lightnings of a coming storm 
while a bugle called demon troops 
to the attack. Roan pushed his glass 
aside, listening, searching for the 
source, and his eyes saw the noise- 
makers behind the flower boxes. 

“Are they doing that?” 

“A clever group, eh. Lieutenant? 
Oh, they know any number of tricks. 
They can make a sound like a 
wounded dire-beast charging — ” 

“Shut up,” Roan said, not even 
noticing he’d said it. “Listen!” Now 
a lonely horn picked out a forlorn 
melody of things beautiful and for- 
gotten, and Roan remembered the 
glimpse he’d almost had, once, of 
how life must have been in the days 
of the Empire. 

The music faded to silence. The 
players mopped at their faces with 
soiled handkerchiefs and reached 
for clay mugs. They looked tired and 
hot and ill-tempered and frightened, 
all at once.' 

“How could a crew of ugly Geeks 
make sounds like that?” he won- 
dered aloud. 

“You like it?” Quex said coldly. 
He was fingering the braid on his 
sleeve rather pointedly. 

“I’m sorry. Commodore,” Roan 
said. “I was quite carried away.” 



Quex managed a sour smile. “It’s 
some ancient thing about a Prince 
called Igor,” he said. “Would you 
like to hear another? They do a 
rather clever thing called Jivin' 
Granny." 

“No.” Roan shook his head to 
clear away the vision. 

Quex chose an attenuated cheroot 
from a blue-and-orange inlaid box a 
cringing slave offered him. The slave 
lit it, and when the lighted match 
fell on the floor from the creature’s 
trembling hand, Quex planted a solid 
kick in its side. It grunted and 
crawled over to Roan and he took 
a cigar and watched the slave crawl 
away. When it thought it was out of 
sight, it patted its injured side and 
wept silently. 

“Now Lieutenant.” Quex blew 
out smoke impatiently, as though he 
enjoyed knowing he was smoking a 
rare weed, but was annoyed with 
the actual process. “You’ve just re- 
ported in from a long cruise. You 
deserve to relax.” 

“I don’t want to relax,” Roan 
said. “I'd like to know about the 
Niss. What kind of fleet can they 
put in space?” 

“Surely all that can wait,” Quex 
said blandly. He waved his glass. 
Wine slopped on the floor and a 
slave scrambled to lick it up. There 
were other slaves under the table, 
eating scraps, and still more crowd- 
ed in, offering finger bowls. An- 
other girl had gotten into his lap 
somehow, and she was breathing 
erotica into his ear. Roan was aware 
that he was dizzier than he should 
be. and he pushed the slaves away 
and forced his eyes to focus.

“I’ve waited long enough,” he 
said. He could feel the thickness of 
his tongue, and he worked on get- 
ting angry enough for his temper to 
boil the lethargy away. 

A slave shoved a vast pile of 
foamy stuff in front of Roan. Quex 
was clapping his hands again and 
there was a stir, and two immense 
dull-faced ITN troopers were haul- 
ing someone small and struggling 
into the open space at the center of 
the square of tables. 

“Sorry if I seemed to have been 
dilatory in handling this matter,” 
Quex was saying, “but I always 
think executions go better with the 
dessert.” 

R oan blinked while the two troop- 
ers held the girl down on a 
short bench with her head over one 
end. 

He recognized her as the one 
who had first gotten into his lap. 
Her gold-dusted hair was in dis- 
array now, and her thin pantaloons 
stuck to her legs. One of the men 
holding her down got out a knife 
with a foot-long blade and casually 
thrust it into the side of her neck. 

She screamed once, and then 
she was slack, and the trooper was 
sawing away, holding the head by 
the hair. He got it free and held it 
up. There was blood on his hands 
to the elbow, and more was spread- 
ing out on the floor. Roan got to 
his feet,’ and his girl pulled him 
back, laughing. 

^“Clumsy oxen,” Quex said. He 
picked up his cigar and drew on it, 
and then tossed it into the soup 
tureen. “You’d think they were 



butchering swine. Try our ice 
cream. It’s rather good, consider- 
ing. “ 

Roan’s men were staring at the 
body of the girl. They were used to 
bloodshed, but they’d never seen 
anything like this. The executioners 
trooped off, one with the head and 
the other with the body, and a 
slave came with a bucket of water 
and a nauseous looking rag. 

“What — ^what — ” Roan stuttered. 

Quex raised his plucked eyebrows. 
“The creature annoyed you. That’s 
something we TerranS don’t tolerate 
in slaves.” 

Roan got to his feet, and the girl 
on his lap squalled and slid off onto 
the floor. 

“All right, men! Up!” He bawled. 
“The party’s over! We’re leaving! 
Let’s march!” 

In the sudden silence, Askor 
laughed foolishly. The ITN person- 
nel stirred at their places, glancing 
toward Quex. Roan went along the 
table to Askor and slapped him so 
hard it hurt at the other end of the 
room. He jerked him to his feet, 
and turned, and Quex was holding 
a long-barreled nerve-gun in his 
hand. It was aimed at Roan. 

“Not so fast. Lieutenant — or 
whatever you are,” the commodore 
said in a voice like chipped glass. 

“You made a poor choice of iden- 
tities.” The identity disk Roan had 
produced dangled from his finger. 
He tossed it to the floor. “Lieuten- 
ant Commander Endor was lost in 
action some six thousand years ago. 
You’re under arrest for mutiny in 
Deep Space and the murder of Com- 
mander Henry Dread.”

R oan looked along the table and 
caught Askor’s yellow eye. The 
men were still in their places, wait- 
ing for the word. The garrison men 
were getting to their feet, gathering 
in clumps, watching. Some of them 
had guns out now. 

Roan moved toward Quex and his 
gun, staggering a little more than 
was necessary. 

“What do you want with me?” 
he said thickly. “You’ve got the 
cargo I brought.” 

“Yes, there is that,” Quex said. 
“Curious, your bringing it here. You 
could have set yourself up in lux- 
ury for life with that haul. However, 
that’s neither here nor there. Now, 
before we go any further, if you’ll 
take off your jacket, please . .” 
Askor stirred. Roan flickered an 
eyelid at him, and the halfbreed 
settled back. Roan stripped off his 
braid 4ieavy jacket and tossed it on 
the floor. The Imperial Terran Sym- 
bol over the pocket made a loud 
clink when it hit. 

‘To the skin, please,” Quex in- 
sisted. Roan pulled off the silky 
white shirt, and the crowd staring 
at him drew in quick breaths. Quex 
got up and came around the end of 
the table, not bothering even to 
kick the crouching slave. His eyes 
were round, taking in Roan’s 
smooth, unscarred hide, and the red- 
dish hair across his chest. 

“Your feet,” he ordered. Roan 
pulled out a chair and sat down and 
pulled off his boots. The spurs 
clanked as he tossed them aside. 
Quex leaned close and stared. 



“Unbelievable,” he said. “You’re 
a Terran. A real Terran. A text- 
book case.” He looked into Roan’s 
eyes with an expression almost of 
awe. “You might even be a Pure 
Strain.” 

“Hurry up and shoot, if you’re 
going to,” Roan said. He picked up 
a glass and drained it. It would 
have ben easy to toss it into^ Quex’s 
face, but he wasn’t ready for that 
yet. 

“Where did you come from 
Who were your parents?” 

“My parents bought me as an 
embryo.” Roan was watching Quex’s 
face. 

“Where?” Quex snapped. 

“At the Thieves’ Market on Tam- 
bool.” 

Quex raised a hand and brought 
it down in a meaningless gesture. 
“Of course. There is a certain fan- 
tastic inevitability to it! A Pure 
Terran, cast among Geeks. Natur- 
ally he would seek out his own.” 

“What do you know about me?” 
Roan interrupted Quex’s soliloquy. 

Q uex stepped back, signed for a 
chair, sank down, watching 
Roan over the gun. He laughed** 
shortly, a silly laugh. “I suppose 
I shall have to abandon the idea 
of shooting you. I’ll make it up by 
planning something rather special 
for these animals of yours who’ve 
had the effrontery to plump them- 
selves down at table with gentle- 
folk.” And Quex tittered again, en- 
joying himself now. “In a way. I’m 
almost a sort of parent to you my- 
self.” He crossed his legs, swinging 
his foot.

“I was rather active in my young- 
er days. The admiral honored me 
by dispatching me as his personal 
agent among the renegade pigs of 
the Gallian World. It was they who 
initiated the experiment. I took a 
chance. Don’t imagine I wasn’t 
aware of the risks! I lifted the en- 
tire lot — the wealth of the Nine 
Gods, and you could hold it in 
your hand! The fools were careless, 
they practically invited me. And 
then I made my error. Trusting 
Geeks! I was an idiot!” 

Roan saw Quex’s finger tighten 
on the firing stud. He tensed, ready 
to jump, but the commodore drew 
a shuddery breath and calmed him- 
self. 

“I was fool enough to divulge the 
nature of the consignment to the 
stinking animal who called himself 
captain of the Gallian vessel on 
which I had arranged passage. It 
was necessary, actually. I demand- 
ed refrigeration facilities, and one 
explanation led to another — 

“He tricked me. At the end of 
the tedious five-year run, I dis- 
covered he had changed course for 
his own world. We landed and he 
turned me and my so-carefully 
guarded prize over to his Shah. This 
heathen considered that it would be 
a tremendously impressive thing to 
parade a palace guard of Terrans 
— Pure Terrans, and all identical. 
Can you imagine it?” Quex held out 
his hand and a glass appeared in it, 
and was filled. He looked at Roan. 
“Am I boring you?” 

Roan let out a breath. “Go on,” 
he said. 

“Alas,” Quex continued. “At this 



crucial moment, a spontaneous 
popular uprising broke out. The 
Shah, his two hundred and thirty- 
four frightful little whelps — and 
anyone else who happened to be 
standing about — were killed.” 

“Spontaneous?” Roan asked. He 
looked at the nearest slave who 
crouched away, quivering. 

“It was as spontaneous,” Quex 
answered, smiling with his bright, 
cruel slits of eyes, “as the ITN 
could make it. My messages to Rim 
HQ had gone through before land- 
ing, of course; the forces arrived 
within a week to restore order. Of 
course, the natives were not so well 
domesticated then. They had a cer- 
tain animal spirit which had to be 
curbed before they were made use- 
ful possessions. I was only fifty-two 
at the time — some twenty-five 
years ago now, Terry reckoning — 
but I had a natural bent for such 
things.” He waved a hand. “The 
rest is history.” 

“And how did I get to Tambool?” 
Roan cut in. 

Quex frowned. “The discussion 
begins to tire me,” he said. “You’re 
a valuable though insolent proper- 
ty, and Admiral Starbird will be de- 
lighted when I report that I’ve re- 
covered the breeding stock that 
slipped through our fingers all those 
years ago.” 

“No, he won’t,” Roan said. “One 
of his spies has already slipped out 
by the side door to report on you.” 

Q uex jerked around to look where 
Roan had pointed and Roan’s 
foot caught the gun, knocked it 
high in the air.

IF 




Then Askar and Sidis were on 
their feet, reaching for the nearest 
ITN man. One aimed a gun at As- 
kor; the giant Minid knocked him 
spinning under the table, whirled 
on a pair of back-pedaling dandies, 
cracked their heads together, tossed 
them aside, caught two more. 

Roan was holding Quex by the 
neck now, and drinking wine from 
the bottle with the other hand. The 
ITN men in the rear milled in loud 
confusion, unable to get a clear 
shot. 

“You Geeks stand back, or we’ll 
shoot!” A frightened looking navy 
man had climbed on a chair and 
was pointing a fancy power pistol 
wildly around the room. Sidis took 
aim, shot him in the head. He 
flopped back in a spatter of blood 
and fell among his fellows. 

There were more shots now as 
the astonished hosts realized that 
their outnumbered victims intended 
to fight back. That was a mistake. 
Four pirate guns went into action, 
blasting wholesale into the scream- 
ing, panicked diners, who jammed 
into the corners and against the 
doors, making effective resistance 
by the few determined men among 
them impossible. 

“Belay that!” Roan yelled over the 
din as a glas§ smashed beside him. 
He hauled Quix into a chair, shout- 
ed again. There were moans and 
howls from the wounded, bellow- 
ing from the enraged crew, the bu^^z 
and crackle of guns. Smoke poured 
up from smoldering hangings ignit- 
ed by wild shots. There was a stink 
of blood and spilled wine in the 
air. Roan jumped on the table and 



shouted for order. By degrees the 
tumult abated. 

“All right,” Roan said. “We’re 
getting out of here, but before we 
go. I’ve got a few more questions 
to ask old rabbit-ears here.” He 
stepped down from the table as 
the men began rifling the bodies and 
pulling fancy ornaments off the liv- 
ing. Quex started at him with wide, 
shocked eyes. 

“You can’t! We outnuriiber you 
fifty to one — a hundred to one!” 
The commodore’s voice rose. He 
started to his feet. “Attack them!” 
he screeched. Roan put a foot against 
his chest and slammed him back, 
then pulled a chair up and sat in 
it. There were two slaves mewling 
under the table; as they realized 
they were in view, they scuttled far- 
ther back. 

A splinter of flying glass had cut 
Roan’s forehead. There was blood 
trickling down into his right eye 
and around his face and onto his 
neck. It annoyed him. 

“Pardon this little interruption. 
Commodore,” he said. “You had 
just come to the part where the 
ITN arrived to restore order. What 
did they do with the embryo — or 
should I say me?” 

Q uex babbled. Roan tossed a wine 
bottle to him, and it fell in his 
lap, bubbled down over his knees. 
He groped it up, drank, lowered 
the bottle with a sob. 

“They ... we ... it wasn’t 
here*. It was gone. Stolen.” 

“It seems to have been remark- 
ably hard property to hang on to. 
What made it so valuable?”

“A specimen of Pure Terran 
stock? Do you jest?” 

“Sure, but there are some fairly 
pure Terries around, like Henry 
Dread. What made me different?” 
“You’re Pure Strain; unbeliev- 
ably pure strain!” 

“All right. Who stole me?” 

“One of my spies, the rotter! A 
creature I trusted!” Quex warmed 
to the memory. “He’d finished his 
work for me, and when I sent a 
couple of men with knives to ad- 
vise him I had no more need of 
his services, he was nowhere to be 
found! He’d skipped out — and the 
special bejeweled incubator unit was 
gone with him! I searched. Oh, how 
I searched! I tore the tongues from 
a hundred man and five hundred 
Geeks, and then at last I got a hint 
— a word babbled by a former offi- 
cer of the Shah’s guard in his dying 
delirium. Tambool. I dispatched a 
crew at once, led by a sturdy Yill 
scoundrel — the best I could find 
among the rabble that follow the 
uniform of the Empire — but none 
of them ever returned. I heard tales, 
later, of how they were set upon 
by a horde of madmen. But the em- 
bryo was lost.” 

“That horde of madmen was my 
dad. Raff Cornay,” Roan said. 
“We’ll drink to him.” He raised his 
bottle and took a long swig. 

“You’re not drinking. Commo- 
dore,” he sdid. “Drink!” 

Quex took a half-hearted sip. 
“Drink, damn you! Or do I have 
to pour it down your neck?” 

Quex drank. 

“Hey, this stuff is all junk, 
Cap’n!” Askor called, tramping over 



to where Roan sat with one boot on 
Quex’s chair. He tossed a handful of 
brass jewelry on the table. “Let’s 
load up on Terry wine and shove 
off. And, uh, a couple of the boys 
was asking, okay if we take along 
a few broads too?” 

The wounded were making a dis- 
mal sound from the heaps where 
they lay. Sidis went over and started 
shooting the noisest ones. The rest 
became quieter. 

“You know better than that,” 
Roan said. “You louts, would be 
cutting each other’s throats in a 
week.” 

“Yeah.” Askor scratched an arm- 
pit with a blunt finger. “I figured.” 

“Round up the boys now. I’ll be 
through in a minute.” Askor turned 
away with a roar of commands. 
Quex trembled so violently his seat 
bounced in the chair. 

“What are y-you g-going to do 
with m-me?” 

‘‘Have another drink,” Roan com- 
manded. He watched while his vic- 
tim complied. 

“I’ll— I’ll be sick,” Quex slob- 
bered. 

R oan got to his feet. He pulled 
his shirt and jacket back on, 
jammed his feet into his boots. 

There was a dead officer lying 
behind his chair. Roan paused long 
enough to take a handsome sheath- 
knife with the Imperial Eagle from 
his body, clip it to his own belt. 

“Askor. Poion, Lock all the 
doors,” he ordered. 

Quex came to his feet. He pulled 
at the edge of his tunic, swaying. 
His eyes were like blood-red clams.

IF • Short Story 



BY 

MIND ALONE 

by LARRY NIVEN 



They had the greatest gift in 
the world — and the deadliest! 



F rom the blue water and crowded 
pines of Lake Arrowhead to 
the rectangular citrus orchards 
around San Bernardino is a drop of 
nearly a mile as the crow falls. The 
road down is hours longer. It falls 
gently, in looping curves and in 
sharp, neck-cracking twists, joins a 
four-lane highway without straight- 
ening out, swoops across empty 
space and winds about dynamite- 
blasted cliffs . of naked rock, until 
after hours of driving the highway 
finally -touches the valley floor and 
takes off straight as a bullet. Carol 
heaved a sigh of relief as we touch- 
ed down, and I said, we’ll find 

a place that’ll sell us cigarettes.” 



We did. Carol and I were both 
nicotine addicts, which had made 
the smokeless drive just that much 
longer. We bought beer, too, and 
took it along. As we were walking 
back to the car, Carol said, “Art, 
why do you suppose Pat didn’t tele- 
port up to the Lake?” 

I thought about that while I got 
the car going. After Carol opened 
the beers and handed me one, I ask- 
ed, “Did she ever tell you how she 
used to go up there every summer 
with her grandparents?” 

“She sure did. Pat must love that 
place.” 

“The long, sweltering drive from 
Beverly Hills to the foot of the 



150 




mountain. The air cooling and thin- 
ning as the car rises; the altitude 
signs showing higher and higher. 
Finally the deep blue of the Lake 
flashing through the pines.” I was 
more or less quoting Pat; but she’d 
described it accurately enough. 
“That’s why she didn’t teleport up. 
The drive is part of going to Lake 
Arrowhead. She didn’t want to miss 
a single detail.” 

“Do you think she’ll be all right?” 
“The doctor said so, didn’t he?” 
“Him! He didn’t even know what 
was wrong with her.” 

“Neither do we.” 

That was arguable. Carol leaned 
her lovely blonde head against the 
headrest and watched the lemon 
groves go by. 

In two hours she would be dead. 
Dead in a manner unique since the 
beginning of time. Dead by my care- 
lessness. But I didn’t know that then. 

She looked out in a silence of 
rushing wind and humming motor, 
and after a time she said, “Well, it 
was one strange party.” 

I t was one strange party, all right. 

Just to get you placed, it all 
took place six years ago, in July of 
1972, during the four-day weekend 
break in the summer semester at 
UCLA. The oil companies were rich 
then, and General Motors was worth 
three times what it is now. 

We changed all that. We knew it 
was coming, but we didn’t expect to 
have to pay for it. We were young. 
Expecting something for nothing is 
part of being young. 

There were seven couples here, 
fourteen of us out of the twenty in 



Larsen’s class, plus Raymond C. F. 
Larsen himself. Pat couldn’t have 
invited more. As it was, some of us 
had been on the couches last night, 
and would be tonight. Pat — Patricia 
Blackman, the richest girl in the 
class — had invited as many as she 
could, and substituted where she got 
turned down, until she had enough 
to jam the wide stone bungalow 
which was Happy DaySy her grand- 
parents’ Lake Arrowhead retreat. 

We wore sweaters and sports 
jackets, having discarded the swim 
suits earlier, and we looked like any 
group of UCLA students working 
out the fate of the world with drinks 
in our hands. But if you watched 
long enough you’d see the differ- 
ences. You’d see somebody vanish 
and reappear elsewhere with a fresh 
drink or a handful of mixed nuts or 
a cigarette stolen from one of Pat’s 
crystal-and-silver cigarette boxes. 
You’d hear a skinny senior describ- 
ing the teleporting society in Bester’s 
The Stars My Destination as if he’d 
thought it up all by himself; and 
you’d see that the five people around 
him were listening, really listening. 
You’d see Carol, ostensibly with me, 
flickering from clump to clump of 
drinkers as she tried to keep up with 
two arguments and a gossip session. 

Larsen’s class was the world’s only 
class in teleportation. It was going 
to change the world. We were going 
to change the world. We felt the 
responsibility, yes we did. Through- 
out most of the big living room the 
talk dealt with nothing else. 

Teleportation is the gentle art of 
wishing yourself from place to place. 
And it w'orks; it works fine, once you 



BY MIND ALONE 



151 




know how. The fifteen in our little 
party seemed to shift like a mirage. 
Watching them hurt the eyes. Pat 
Blackman was even busier than Car- 
ol, emptying ash trays, seeing that 
everyone had a drink, changing re- 
cords and generally playing the per- 
fect hostess, all at distance-anihilat- 
ing jumps like the flicker of a worn 
film. Ten minutes ago she’d stopped 
a fight by sheer diplomacy, when Tim 
Something tried to save a moment 
by teleporting into the john when 
Linda Baird was already there. In 
the middle of the room, tall and ca- 
daverous and twenty-two years older 
than anyone else. Dr. Raymond C. 
F. Larsen was holding forth. 

H e looked like the melancholy 
farmer with the pitchfork in 
American Gothic would look if you 
gave him a loud sports coat and a 
yellow tie and poured three martinis 
into him. “It means the total break- 
down of physics!” he roared, jab- 
bing a grinning sophomore in the 
chest with a forefinger. “We’ll have 
to rewrite every law we know!” 
“Nuts,” said the sophomore, who 
was a physics major. 

“Go on,” Larsen prompted. He 
loves an argument. Carol once said 
he’d rather fight than smoke. 

“Be happy to,” said the sopho- 
more. “Ever since the Renaissance, 
every chapge we’ve made in physics 
has been something of a generaliza- 
tioii. Every previous law was a spe- 
cial, local case of the laws we use 
now. What we’ve got will work just 
like it always has.” 

“Except teleportation.” 

I thought the sophomore had the 



short end of the argument. General 
relativity, which was evolved to ex- 
plain a mere fourteen-minute preces- 
sion in Mercury’s orbit, had smashed 
Newtonian physics. The Principle of 
Uncertainty had ended the philo- 
sophy of determinism without chang- 
ing any part of real life. So, per- 
versely, 1 stepped in in the sopho- 
more’s favor. 

“Suppose teleportation was re- 
stricted to the laws of physics?” 

“That’s impossible!” came the roar 
of opinion. But Larsen. said, “How? 
Think of something we can test. 
Art.” 

“All right.” 

“Pat! We’re out of cigarettes.” 

Pat came out of nowhere near the 
big table in the middle of the room. 
“Right,” she said, and disappeared. 
In a few moments she was back. 
“There aren’t any in the closets, 
either. Hmmmmm.” In voice and 
mannerisms and the mobility of her 
not-pretty, not-homely face, Patricia 
Blackman was larger than life. She 
stood there with an index fingernail 
tapping her teeth, her eyes fixed up 
and sideways, the very picture of the 
word scheme. “I’ll have to go for 
some.” 

“Let me go,” I offered. “I know 
where the Village is.” The Village is 
a tiny cluster of shops across the 
Lake. Besides being the perfect gen- 
tleman, I wanted time to think of an 
answer to Larsen’s challenge. 

But Pat’s wide mouth grinned at 
me under the Roman nose. “It’s 
Sunday,** she proclaimed triumphant- 
ly. Everything’s closed.** She leaned 
close and patted me on the arm. 
“Now don’t worry, hon. I’ll get some

at the beach house. Mother’s got 
stacks of cartons in the downstairs 
closet.” 

“Hold it, Pat. Hermosa Beach is 
a long way from here.” 

“We’ve all gone further than 
that/' she said, and was gone. Her 
cheerful smile seemed to disappear 
a split second after she did — like 
the Cheshire cat. 

Too late to stop her. Pat was at 
the beach — now. 

I said, “Doctor Larsen, could that 
be dangerous?” 

He shook his head. “She’s right. 
From the campus to San Diego was 
much further.” 

“But we did that under supervised 
conditions.” 

“How do you supervise telepor- 
tation?” Larsen smiled like a child 
with a joke. “You all know as much 
about teleportation as I do,” 

Good Lord, I thought, and wished 
myself to the bar to fill my glass. If 
I’d known that at the beginning of 
the course I’d have backed out right 
then. I’d only joined out of curiosity; 
curiosity, and the fact that Carol was 
in it. Why not? It was only a six- 
week course, and no credit meant 
nothing to lose. 

And Larsen could make any 
course fun. ' 

We’d sat in the classroom chairs 
with the plywood platforms for 
notebooks, listening to Larsen de- 
liver his introductory lecture. Half 
of us already knew him from his 
philosophy of chemistry courses. The 
rest didn’t know whether to giggle 
or not. Larsen is a frustrated actor. 
When he lectures he waves his arms 



and marches back and forth and 
shifts djalects to act out his ideas. 
His dialects are lousy, but he doesn’t 
know that. His story was as incred- 
ible as his lecture style. 

On a Sunday afternoon about 
three months ago,’ Dr. Raymond C. 
F. Larsen had leaned back in his 
swivel chair, gotten his pipe going, 
and begun daydreaming of the many 
things he’d like to do before he was 
old. Become a spelunker. Learn to 
ride a surfboard. Eat steak tartare, 
just once. When he got up to take 
a shower, he was really into the 
swing of it. He stood with his back 
to the shower head, with the hot 
water falling heavily on the back of 
his neck, and there he made his 
great decision. He would join a nud- 
ist camp that very summer! 

Would he have backed out? Of 
course he’d have backed out. But 
he didn’t get the chance, because the 
next he knew, no more water was 
falling, and there was a very cold 
breeze all around him. 

He stood in the center of Sun- 
and-Fun Nature Camp, just thirty 
miles north of Los Angeles. And he 
was dripping wet and stark naked. 
From all directions, thoroughly tan- 
ned men and women as naked as he 
stared at him in obvious horror* 

Sure they were staring. They’d 
seen him appear out of nowhere! 
But Larsen didn’t think of that. He 
crouched like a man with acute in- 
testinal cramps, trying to cover him- 
self (he demonstrated for us, there 
in the classroom), and frantically 
wished himself back into his show- 
er. 

He knew he could do it, now, any 



BY MIND ALONE 



153 




time he wanted. (He demonstrated 
this, too, and twenty laughing stu- 
dents, laughing at his antics whether 
they believed his story or not, went 
utterly silent.) But could he teach 
others the art? He wanted to know 
all about teleportation: its limits, its 
uses, its dangers. 

Give him credit for courage. He 
went before the Board. The Board 
of Trustees watched him flicker 
around the Board Room like a ca- 
daverous hallucination, and after a 
four-hour conference they had agreed 
to let him try . 

. The first few class days, Lar- 
sen had been the only teleport. The 
rest of us would grit our teeth and 
clench our eyelids, while Larsen 
cried, “No, no, no! You’ve got to 
be relaxed, confident. Look at me!” 
And with an expression so confi- 
dent it couldn’t look anything but 
silly, Larson would teleport all over 
the room. He inspired nothing but 
envy. 

He tried beer, which he’d been 
drinking that historic day: two- 

thirds of a can of Coors per stu- 
dent. He tried beer and a pipe, his 
own carefully broken-in Dunhill with 
the mouthpiece dipped in antiseptic 
each time one of us used it. Carol 
flatly refused to touch it. He tried 
having us teleport out of our own 
showers, while he called encourage- 
ment from outside the curtain. One 
day he tried* beer plus a tranquilizer. 

And suddenly Linda Baird wasn't 
amorfg us. 

I got my drink replenished and 
reached for a cigarette to occupy 
my other hand. I was out, and Pat 



wasn’t back yet. Nuts. I joined Lar- 
sen again. Shouldering my way in- 
to the group that surrounded him. 

His eyes lit. “Art, have you 
thought of an experiment for us?” 

I hadn’t, but I said, “Yah. Get 
someone to teleport to two different 
places at the same time. If it v/orks, 
there’ll be two of him, and that’ll 
violate the Law of Conversation of 
Matter.” 

That got a laugh. Larsen said, 
“All right, you’re elected to go first.” 
“Let’s let Carol go first. Two of 
Carol would be a fun thing.” 

She was standing right beside me, 
of course, and she cocked her head 
at me and asked, “What are you but- 
tering me up for?” 

“Got a cigarette?” 

She had two, and she grimaced 
when she had to give me one. It was 
mentholated, and it was dried from 
the altitude, but I’ll smoke anything 
in an emergency. Carol said, “Pat 
should have been back by now.” 

I nodded. It had been a good fif- 
teen minutes. 

“We’d better call her home.” Lar- 
sen sounded a bit uneasy. 

Lon Dugan was the guy she’d 
come with, and he had her beach 
house number. We crowded around 
while Larsen made the call, When 
he hung up he looked very sober. 
“She’s been taken sick,” he said. 

W e got the story out of him. 

Pat’s parents had been watch- 
ing television when they’d heard a 
scream from the next room. They’d 
rushed in to find Pat on the floor, 
already unconscious, with a blazing 
fever. The doctor was there now. 



154 



IF 




“I’m going after her,” said Lon 
Dugan. 

“Take the car!” Larsen ordered. 
“Don’t try any more teleporting.” 

Lon went outside and we heard 
his car starting. The rest of us 
stayed, but not in any party mood. 
Had Pat strained her powers, or 
weakened some unknown and un- 
guessed region in her brain? There 
was no real evidence for it, but most 
of us were convinced that Pat was 
sick because she had teleported. Lar- 
sen obviously thought so. His air of 
clownish good humor was gone. He 
sat on the couch and silently wor- 
ried. 

Half and hour later we called 
again. 

When the doctor arrived Pat had 
a temperature of one hundred and 
four. Her cheeks were flaming red, 
and the touch of her skin burned. 
The doctor refused to make a diag- 
nosis, saying that all of her symp- 
toms seemed to proceed directly 
from the fever. Now the fever had 
dropped to an even hundred. 

Another half hour before our 
next call. The fever was falling with 
unlikely speed. It was down to nine- 
ty-nine point one. Pat had been con- 
scious for a few minutes, and the 
doctor had immediately given her 
a sedative. ,He knew about our ex- 
periments with teleportation, and he 
didn’t want Pat going anywhere in 
her present condition. It was typical 
of Pat that she had left orders for 
the party to go on without her. But 
that didn’t seem right. People began 
leaving by twos and fours. Larsen 
was still on the couch, looking like 
the Thinker now, or like a math 



student heating his head against an 
exam problem that won’t come right. 

S o we edged the car out from 
among the other cars and took 
off down the twisting concrete road 
that leads a mile down to the base 
of the mountains. We all had our 
cars, because none of us but Pat 
would have known where to teleport 
to. It was a silent drive until we got 
the cigarettes. They seemed to loosen 
us up, to get us talking. 

“Yeah, a strange party,” I agreed. 
“Carol, do you think Pat’s teleport- 
ing made her sick?” 

“Of course. But I don’t know why 
it should.” 

“Maybe it didn’t. Maybe it’s just 
our native egotism, our — hubris — 
that makes us think the whole world 
revolves around our new power.” 

“ ‘Ubris?’ ” 

“Hubris. The pride that challenges 
the gods.” 

“Oh.” She couldn’t have cared 
less. “Why would Pat have to go 
all the way to the beach for ciga- 
rettes?” 

I knew what she meant. “Pat’s 
just honest.” 

“Suppose she’d teleported inside a 
shop, made a list of what she took, 
then paid off the bill Monday. What’s 
wrong with that?” 

“It could give her a reputation.” 
“A reputation for honesty.” 
“Couldn’t it make a storekeeper 
nervous, knowing there were people 
around who could get into his shop 
any time they wanted?” 

“Mmmm.” 

We drove with the windows open. 
It was hot down here on the flat- 



BY MIND ALONE 



15S 




lands. The sun was setting in red 
glory behind endless groves of citrus 
tr^es. Above the low music from the 
radio, Carol said thoughtfully, “Art, 
why not steal?” 

“I thought one of us would get 
there eventually.” 

“I mean it. The penalty for theft 
is imprisonment, right? How do you 
imprison a teleport?” 

“You don’t. You can’t.” 

“WeU?” 

“How about public opinion? 

And where would you like to have 
dinner?” 

“The ‘Four-In-Hand, I guess.” 
“Would you proclaim it far and 
wide that you’re an untouchable 
thief and don’t give a damn who 
knows it? How many friends would 
you have left?” 

“Oh.” 

“But that wouldn’t work on every- 
body. Fact is, the law doesn’t take 
teleportation into account. When it 
does, they’ll change the penalty to 
‘shoot on sight’.” 

Carol giggled. “I guess so. You’ve 
nipped a brilliant crime career in 
the bud.” 

“You mean I’ve made an honest 
woman of you.” 

“Have it your way.” 

“I’ve been trying.” 

“What happened to her. Art?” 
The fear in her voice made me 
look over. Carol was scared, deep 
down scared, and all the banter- 
ing and philosophical discussions 
wouldn’t hide it. I said, “There must 
be laws we don’t know about yet. 
Pat ran into one.” 

“How? What did she do that we 
didn’t?” 



T he first time, it’s like diving from 
a fifty foot board into what 
you’re sure is concrete. You can’t! 
You know you can’t! You swallow 
more beer, and the tranquilizer be- 
gins to reach you, and Larsen, com- 
manding, says “Now!” And you’re 
home, with no chair under you. 
When you get up there’s beer all 
over your shirt. You feel wonder- 
ful. 

Pat was the fourth to learn, right 
after me. At the end of the second 
week we walked like we. owned the 
Earth. Some of us thought we did. 
We could teleport, all of us. We 
made excursions. We drove to the 
San Diego Zoo, and from the en- 
trance we teleported back to the 
classroom and back again to the 
entrance, one at a time. People 
stared. Lon appeared in the cage 
with the grizzly bear, and called it 
a coward when it wouldn’t wrestle, 
and when it finally came at him he 
was outside the bars, laughing. 

Euphoria? Pride? What we felt 
really was hubris. We had beaten 
God’s laws, and now no law of 
Man could touch us. We were the 
new lords of creation . until Pat, 
who knew neither pride nor humility, 
was laid low by a law none of us 
could understand. 

If she had been. 

No wonder wc were frightened. 
Hubris is the overweaning pride that 
brings down the gods’ most terrible 
wrath. 

No, Pat hadn’t done anything we 
hadn’t done. She’d been treated just 
like the others, traveled just as far 
as the others. Unless . 

“She might have done more tele- 

IF 



156 




porting than we did,” I said. “There’s 
no way to tell. Did she usually walk 
upstairs? I do, unless I’m in a hurry. 
She runs out of gas pretty often, 
doesn’t she? Then she’d teleport to 
a gas station she knew, maybe miles 
away. Does she usually take her car 
to cocktail parties, shopping trips and 
so on?” 

“At the party she looked like she 
was everywhere at once.” 

“So did you. Maybe that’s it. She 
wore herself out, then overstrained 
. uh-oh.” I turned to look Carol 
in the eye. “Now listen to me, baby. 
Don’t you do any more teleporting 
for awhile! You were flipping around 
just as much as Pat.” 

“Look at the road, dammit. I 
promise.” 

C arol was half asleep when we hit 
the freeway. I shifted us into 
the fast lane and relaxed. No more 
stoplights for the next hour. By and 
by I saw that half the cars around us 
had their headlights on. I followed 
their example. 

Just as I was sure Carol was 
asleep, she opened her eyes and 
asked, “Could it have been the 
height?” 

“What about the height?” 

“Pat. Lake Arrowhead is a mile 
up. Hermosa Beach is at sea level. 
None of us had ever had to teleport 
over such a big difference in alti- 
tude.” 

“That’s right. But I don’t see what 
difference it makes.” 

“Some unknown law. Like you 
said.” 

We left it at that, as far as talking 
went. I was still thinking about hub- 



ris. It’s an old concept, possibly 
present in every religion. The god or 
gods will instantly smite anyone who 
shows pride enough to insult them. 
Jehovah changed human language 
rather than let men build a tower to 
Heaven at Babel. Niobe’s fourteen 
children were killed in a day and a 
night when she dared compare her 
fecundity against the divine Leto’s. 
Hubris is always the first and great- 
est crime. 

Were we expecting the divine 
wrath? We had smashed God’s laws 
of physics, and subconsciously we 
awaited punishment. 

I told myself we had let a simple 
case of flu scare us into cat fits. 

But . the phrase skittered about 
in my head. Some unknown law, 
some unknown law . Was the 
universe playing tricks on us? 

Man finds the unexpected in every 
new field. The Bernoulli effect in- 
verts itself, disastrously at first, above 
the speed of sound. Mercury loses 
her hydrogen atmosphere to solar 
heat, but, amazingly, draws it back 
from the solar wind. The problem 
of Venus’ opaque atmosphere be- 
comes ridiculously simple; but as- 
tronomers realize for the first time 
that the Moon has tom away ninety- 
nine per cent of Earth’s air. 

Some unknown law .... The 
most shocking thing about Pafs 
sudden sickness was her sudden re- 
covery. One minute, a kflling fever. 
An hour later, just half a degree. 
And it had taken the doctor ten min- 
utes to get there. When had Pat’s 
fever been at its peak? 

Her parents had rushed into the 
living room at the sound of her 



BY MIND ALONE 



157 




scream. She'd been burning hot to 
the touch, within seconds of her ar- 
rival. 

On her arrival? 

Yet I’d have sworn she was nor- 
mal when she left the Lake .... 

I had it then, the whole answer in 
three words. Larsen was in for a 
surprise. “Unknown law, hell!’’ 
“What?” Carol looked up with 
sleepy eyes. 

“You were dead right. It was the 
altitude — ” 

I was interrupted. 

L ater the newspapers filled me in 
on the details. A genuine pea- 
soup fog had come to the Los 
Angeles area, a fog such as you 
won’t find here once in five years. 
It had come rolling in over the free- 
way, sharp edged and very thick, and 
when cars hit it, they hit suddenly 
and slowed drastically. Sunday nights 
are traffic jam nights anyway. This 
jam was long and dead slow, and 
its tail was just inside the curtain 
of fog. 

I saw the lights blur around me, as 
I saw a fuzzy red glow ahead become 
two fuzzy red lights. A car, stopped 
dead! (He might as well have been. 
He was doing five miles an hour with 
frequent stops.) 

Does it sound like a long time? 
Three seconds did it. I stamped on 
the brake pedal, and from the cor- 
ner of my eye I saw Carol vanish. I 
screamed, “Oh, you idiot, you idiot! 
Carol, come back!” 

The two taillights smashed me in 
the face. 

I raised my head and felt with my 
tongue for broken teeth. I found 



four. I was jammed between the 
steering wheel and the driver’s seat, 
and I couldn’t move at all. All I 
could do was wait for help. 

And Carol was gone, which meant 
Carol was dead. 

Pat would be all right. But Lar- 
sen was in for a surprise. We 
wouldn’t be changing any laws of 
physics. What Pat had run into was 
the law of Conservation of Energy. 
In teleporting a mile downhill she’d 
lost a good deal of potential energy. 
She’d gotten it back in heat: about 
seven degrees per mile. 

And if that law held, so did con- 
servation of momentum. 

Some cops came along and pried 
me out of the car. A doctor told me 
how lucky I was, and I believed 
him, because all I had was two 
cracked ribs and four teeth knocked 
out on the steering wheel, which is 
why my smile today is so even and 
bright. 

The next morning Larsen visited 
me at the hospital. He told me about 
Carol. 

She’d teleported home. She’d ap- 
peared in the middle of her bedroom, 
four feet from a startled maid. The 
maid was in the hospital, suffering 
from shock. 

Last night a jerking muscle woke 
me up to catch myself whispering, 
“Carol, come back. Come back.” I 
hope she doesn’t. It’s been six years 
since she rammed into a bedroom 
wall at sixty miles per hour, without 
even a seat belt to protect her. If she 
came back now, she’d be breaking 
another of God’s marvelously con- 
sistent laws. And you can’t do that.

Dear Editor: 

I have copies of If back to 
the beg'inning of the second issue, 
and although I have not looked very 
hard I have yet to see a letter pub- 
lished from over here in dear old 
Sunny England. Haven^t we paid 
back our War Debt yet or some- 
thing? Although If and WOT are 
appearing on the stands here six 
months behind current, lots of peo- 
ple I know think both mags great 
and 7/ is quite a hit in our college, 
especially in the Sci Fi Society. 
Here is a list of praises, ringing 
with shouts of adulation: 

1) Retief — terrific, especially 
Reliefs War. 

2) C. C. MacApp — excellent; 
glad to see he has more strings to 
his bow than Gree, viz. the long 
story in the February *65 issue. 

3) Saberhagen — magnificent; 
waiting impatiently for the long 
stories promised. 

4) Heinlein — praise again (at 
last I know what Tanstaafl 
means!), although one criticism: 
Could have done without Podkayne 
of Mars serial in 1963. 

5) E. E. Smith — more than very 
good story, Skylark DuQuesne — a 
great pity that there Is no more to 
follow. 



6) Lots of new names, R. Laffer- 
ty, etc. 

What about a sequel to Starchildy 
featuring The Ed, and Williamson? 
Say the first round between man- 
kind and the stars — if they bother 
to notice us. Plea for the future: 
More Van Vogt, Laumer, Heinlein!

Dear Editor: 

Looking back over the issues of If, 
I noticed that from June to October 
1965 you ran a story. Skylark Du- 
Quesne by the unmatchable E. E. 
Smith, Ph.D. Pve just observed that 
a recent Ace Book carried the an- 
nouncement of Smith*s death; how- 
ever Smith died on August 31, 1965, 
nearly five months ago. As far as 
I can see. If carried no such note 
of any kind during that period. 
However, Pm not going to quarrel 
why or why not this information 
was not published, just that I see 
no reason for delay. 

Being a fond reader of his, I was 
able to derive only fractions from 
his life and his works. I would 
appreciate any available informa- 
tion concerning his biography and 



159 




if all possible, anything close to a 
phoUgraph. Thank you . — Richard

Dear Editor: 

I was sorry to' hear that Doc 
Smith was dead, especially since 
he was just beginning: to resume 
really writing once more, and I 
would like to say a few words in 
praise of him. 

I have not read much of his 
work, but what I have read had 
impressed me with one thing — he 
Thinks Big. He tosses around con- 
cepts and huge events almost gaily, 
like a little boy playing v/ith a ball. 
A planet being vaporized, or things 
like Lenses, are nothing to him. 
Albeit, he is not the best writer 
there ever was; sometimes he seems 
a little dated. However, his business 
was as a chemist, and if he had 
spent a lot more time on his writ- 
ing, science fiction would be an 
even better thing than it is. 

A few words about your maga- 
zine. Looking over the November, 
1964 issue, I find it somewhat fee- 
ble, while your most recent issue 
is a drastic improvement. The gen- 
eral level of all the stories seems 
to be improving. You don’t have 
the best s-f magazine there is, but 
you are getting better steadily. 

There is one type of story I 
would especially like to see, and 
that is ‘‘swords and scorcery.” How- 
ever, I am afraid that is not quite 
the kind of material you use. Also, 
some more work by Edmond Hamil- 
ton would be very much in hand. 

Many critics have complained of 
the lack of s-f magazines, com- 
pared with the great numbers there 
have been in the past. I, however, 
believe this sort of thing runs in 



cycles. Looking back over the his- 
tory of s-f, one finds this so. There 
were many mags in the early thir- 
^ ties, a slack in the middle of that 
decade, and then another rise just 
before the war. Then again in the 
early fifties .there was another up- 
surge, and nov/ I think we are 
entering still another. There have 
been three new imaginative maga- 
zines, (possibly four), counting 
Web Terror Tales, which I know 
very little about, and am thus un- 
qualified to speak about, over the 
last five years: Worlds of Tomor- 
row, Magazine of Horror, and Gam- 
ma. 

That someone is willing to buy 
your magazine indicates a poten- 
tial market, and this general rise 
in quality and quantity over the 
last few years indicates the market 
is responding. 

So — worry rot. (Too much.) — 
Kent Peacock. 

j|s ♦ 

Dear Editor: 

The latest issue (September, 
1965) of If is a big improvement. 
Especially as regarding the interior 
art. It looks like you had a little 
fun with satire in that first story. 
You are forgiven this time, but 
don’t let it happen again. At least, 
don’t use foreign phrases. I had 
to grab my French-English dic- 
tionary to find out what was going 
on a couple of times. That was 
work; and I hate work. 

I wish I could find out why some 
of today’s writers insist on re- 
placing the trusty old ray gun with 
a laser. I ran into that wall, again, 
in Greeks Damned Ones. The laser 
is the one thing that would be 
almost impossible to turn into a 
weapon. Actually, a laser is not 
any single object; it can be created

out of a number of things. Laser 
is not a word, but a collection of 
words describing a polarization ef- 
fect. The full statement is Light 
Amplification by Stimulater Emis- 
sion of Radiation. Laser only re- 
fers to the use of light. However, 
it was preceded by the maser; Mi- 
crowave Amplification by Stimu- 
lated Emission of Radiation. I get 
a little irritated when some pro- 
tagonists pulls one of these things 
out of a holster. 

Aside from these little irrita- 
tions, it was a fine issue. — D. 
Bruce Berry, 4554 N. Malden St.,

Dear Editor: 

I usually don’t go in for that 
^‘letters to the editor” stuff, but 
something’s got me bugged. I hope 
that the thirty-two new pages in If 
do not bring any science-fact arti- 
cles to your wonderful magazine. 
There’s hardly a science-fiction 
magazine without some dull (to me, 
at least) science article taking up 
pages that could be filled with ac- 
tion. 

I think Laumer’s Retief stories 
are fine, but the stories that real- 
ly grab me are Saberhagen’s Ber- 
serker jobs. — Shawn Wright, 4115 
South Delaware, Independence, Mis- 
souri, 64050. 

# Nope, no science articles are 
planned — r at least, not unless we 
come across something unusual 
enough and interesting enough to 
avoid being dull I — Editor, 

* * * 

Dear Editor: 

You were right when you said 
that The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress 
is Heinlein’s best since Stranger in 
a Strange Land, However, that isn't 
saying very much. All Mr. Heinlein 



turned out in that period was Pod- 
kayne of MarSy Glory Road and 
Farnham’s Freeholdy all of which 
are below his average. 

All its faults considered, I still 
nominate The Moon Is a Harsh 
Mistress for Best Novel of 19G6. 
My nominations for 1965 were. Best 
Short Story, Mindswapy by Robert 
Sheckley; Best Novel, The ^Thrce 
Stigmata of Palmer Eldritchy by 
Philip K. Dick. 

Earthhloody at least in its first 
part, seems to have its points, but 
I have the feeling Keith Laumer 
could have done better alone. It 
appears to be set in the far future 
of the Retief stories. 

Please get A. E. Van Vogt to 
write a third Null- A novel that will 
tie up all those loose ends! Earth 
and Venus are about to be destroyed, 
and Enro is still conquering the 
League! Can’t Gosseyn use his 
vaunted extra brain to get us out 
of it? — John Hoggatt, 3473 West

Dear Editor: 

I would like to make a few com- 
ments regarding the November edi- 
torial on racial differences. 

In it, you state that “Negroes 
score lower on intelligence tests 
than whites but Northern Negroes 
score higher on intelligence tests 
than Southern Whites, presumably 
because of better schools, better 
public health facilities, etc.” From 
this you conclude that “most racial 
differences are environmental rather 
than innate.” 

* You are probably referring here 
to the Army Alpha intelligence tests 
which were administered to white 
and Negro soldiers during World 
War I. First of all, the argument 
in the given context is fallacious. 
When two large groups are given 
the same test, you cannot select 
small groups ad lib. from the two 
score distributions for comparison. 
In 1918-19, the schools of the South 
lagged behind those of the North 
in both equipment and teacher- 
training. The correlation of Alpha 
and ^hooling was about .70, and 
urban dwellers scored higher than 
rural. Therefore the difference of 
8 points between 665 rural Missis- 
sippi whites and 152 urban Ohio 
Negroes (the largest mean differ- 



ence) could mean simply that edu- 
cation and other environmental fac- 
tors lower the scores of white as well 
^as Negroes. The only fair compar- 
ison on Army Alpha is that of 
Negroes and whites from the same 
state, where schools and other con- 
ditioning factors are roughly equat- 
ed. When this is done, Negroes still 
trail whites by 15 to 20 IQ points, 
about the national average. — Mike 
Hansen, 12228 Elderberry Street, 
Chino, California 91710. 

# Thanks, but the fallacy in your 
argument is that conditioning fac- 
tors for whites and for Negroes are 
in no large area in this country 
really “roughly equated.” A ghetto 
is a ghetto, whether it exists in 
Harlem or in Watts. An inferior 
school is an inferior school, whether 
it is separate by law, as Negro 
schools were in the South, or sep- 
arate by geography, as in the North. 
A couple of weeks ago in Toronto 
we were discussing this subject 
with Dr. Edward McKeown (old- 
time sf fans may remember him as 
chairman of the 1948 World SF 
Convention in Toronto; now he is 
an executive of the Toronto Board 
of Education). Toronto has a small 
and thoroughly integrated Negro 
population. The difference in 
achievement between Negroes and 
whites whether measured in IQ 
scores, school tests or any other 
quantitative marking, are — in Ned 
McKeown^s word — “indefectible.” 
That about does it for another 
month. Don’t forget Jim Blish’s 
serial starting in the next issue. 
His major character is a teen-age 
boy who happens to be the first 
human being to land on Mars — 
because he didn’t know it was im- 
possible! It’s a good one.

IF 





Could you write 
for television? 



By Max Shulman 



X rankly, I don’t know. But this I do know: 
when I was running the Dobie Gillis show, 
I often paid $2,500 and more for scripts 
turned out by people who should have been 
arrested for impersonating writers. 

How such people got to be high-priced 
TV writers is not as mysterious as it seems. 
Television is an insatiable maw into which 
scripts must be fed at a rate unprecedented 
in the history of entertainment. It is a grate- 
ful producer indeed who consistently gets 
scripts which have been written with real 
understanding of television’s powers and 
limitations. 

To help train new TV writers, I joined 
with Rod Serling (creator of The Twilight 
Zone, winner of five Emmy Awards) and 
ten other leading authors* to start the 
Famous Writers School. We pooled every- 
thing we had learned in our long years in the 
business to devise four professional writing 
courses that men and women, seriously in- 
terested in writing, could take in their own 
homes in their free time. 



story (or documentary or commercial) in 
quick, visual sequences . the knack of 
thinking and writing with a lens! 

Through a series of carefully planned 
assignments, you learn as you write— guided 
by our own specially organized textbooks. 
Your assignments are painstakingly edited 
and revised by our staff of instructors, them- 
selves all professional writers. Under our 
supervision, an instructor works with you 
by mail, much as a producer or editor works 
with an established writer. 



Do you have an aptitude for writing? 

To help you (and us) decide whether you’ve 
got the stuff to be a writer, we have worked 
up a revealing aptitude test. The coupon 
below will bring you a copy, along with a 
4s-page School brochure. If your test indi- 
cates aptitude, you are eligible to enroll in 
the School. You are, however, under no ob- 
ligation to do so.
