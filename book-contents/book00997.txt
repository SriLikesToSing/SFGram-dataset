Annual Report to our Readers 

The twelvemonth between our first annual report and this, which marks 
the beginning of our third year, was rammed full of activity for GALAXY. 
H all boils down to this one astonishing fact, however: 

GALAXY has acquired the second largest circulation in science fiction 
and is pushing hard toward first place. 

For a magazine to achieve this record in so short a time is a tribute to 
its unyielding policy of presenting the highest quality obtainable; to its 
readers for' their loyalty and appreciation; to its authors for helping it 
maintain those standards and even advance theAi. 

During the turbulent first year of GALAXY'S existence, other publishers 
thought the idea of offering mature science fiction in attractive, adult 
format was downright funny. They knew what sold— shapely female endo- 
morphs with bronze bras, embattled male mesomorphs clad in muscle, and 
frightful alien monsters in search of a human meal. v 

Eyen our former publisher became infected with that attitude, and the 
resulting internal conflicts were no joke ot all. But now: 

• We have the biggest promotion campaign mapped out that any science 
fiction magazine has ever had. 

• We are working out the broadest circulation possible. Note that we 
reach the stands regularly on the second Friday of each month. (Sub- 
scribers, however, get their copies at least five to ten days before.) 

• Better printing, paper and reproduction of art lie ahead. 

• These new art techniques I mentioned in the past are on their way. 
They were stubborn things to conquer, but you'll be seeing them soon. 

• If you want to find WILLY LEY in a science fiction magazine henceforth, 
you'll have to buy GALAXY. As our science editor, he will work exclusively 
for us in this field. 

• Last and by far the most important, the literary quality of GALAXY will 
continue to be a rising curve— as steeply rising as we can manage. 

Coming up, for example: 

• Noyember; THE MARTIAN WAY by Isaac Asimov, a novella that intro- 
duces problems and situations in space travel that I have never seen before. 

• December: RING AROUND THE SUN by Clifford D. Simak is a powerful 
new serial with a. startling theme and one surprising development after 
another. 

• March: After the conclusion of the Simak serial, we have THE OLD DIE 
RICH by a chap named Gold. Naturally, the story was read by impartial 
critics— no writer can judge his own work— and they report it's GALAXY 
quality. ! hope you'll agree with them. 

Yes, it's been a fine year. Next year looks even better.

GUNNER CADE 

science fiction to suit 
the expert's taste 



"Gunner Cade 
is surety one oj 
the most excit- 
ing of science fiction stories.” That's 
hotv John W. Campbell, Jr., dean 
of s i: editors, describes this new 
novel by Cyril Judd. He also calls 
it "an ingenious, drilling, and 
thoroughly plausible account of 
the ways in which a new human 
society could be built by subtle 
and not-so-subtle twistings of our 
present culture.” 

44 A very rare sort of book — an 
intelligent spinq-tingler.” That’s 
what William Tenn terms Gunner 
Cade. This highly regarded (and 
hard-lo-please) s-f writer credits 
it with being "a most frightening 
Study of the ‘soldier mentality’ and 
where it might lead us. - ” 

Pretty fair praise — and you’ll 
find it’s no more than this swift.

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




IS THREE 

t 

Gerard's problem would dismay any psychotherapist. He knew his 
name without knowing his identity; what he did, but not what 
he was. Worse yet, he didn't know how many of him there were! 




Illustrated by 
DON SIBLEY 



1 FINALLY got in to see this 
Stern. He wasn’t an old man 
at all. He looked up from his 
desk, flicked his eyes over me 
once, and picked up a pencil. “Sit 
over there, Sonny.” 

I stood where I was until he 
looked Up again. Then I said, 
“Look, if a midget walks in here. 
What do you say — sit over there, 
Shorty?” 

He put the pencil down again 
and stood up. He smiled. His 
smile was as quick and sharp as 
his eyes. “I was wrong,” he said, 
“but how am I supposed to know 
you don’t want to be called 
Sonny?” 

That was better, but I was still 
mad. “I’m fifteen and I don’t 
have to like it. Don’t rub my nose 
in it.” 

He smiled again and said okay, 
and I went and sat down. 
“What’s your name?” 

“Gerard.” 

“First or last?” 

“Both,” I said. • 



BABY IS THREE 



* 



“Is that the truth?" • 

I said, “No. And don’t ask me 
where I live either.” 

He put down hte pencil. “We’re 
not going to get very far this 
way.” 

“That’s up to> you. What are 
you worried about? I got feelings 
of hostility? Well, sure I have. I 
got lots more things than that 
wrong with me or I wouldn’t be* 
here. Are you going to let that 
stop you?” 

“Well, no, but— ” 

“So what else is bothering you? 
How .you’re going to get paid?” 
I took, out a thousand-dollar bill 
and laid it on the desk. “That’s 
so you won’t have to bill me. You 
keep track of it. Tell me when it’s 
used up and I’ll give you more. 
So you don’t need my address. 
Wait,” I said, when he reached 
toward the money. “Lot it lay 
there. I want to be sure you and I 
are going to get along.” 

TTE folded his hands. “I don’t 
* do business this way, Son — I 
mean, Gerard.” \ 

“Gerry,” I told him. “You do, 
if you do business with me.” 

“You make things difficult, 
don’t you? Where did you get a 
thousand dollars?” 

“I won a contest. Twenty-five 
words or less about how much 
fun it is to do my daintier under- 
things with Sudso.” I leaned for- 
ward. “This time it’s the truth.” 



“All right,” he said. 

I was surprised. I think he 
knew it, but he didn’t say any- 
thing more. Just waited for me 
to go ahead. 

“Before we start — if we start,” 
I said, “I got to know something. 
The things I say to you — what 
comes out while you’re working 
on me — is that just between us, 
like a priest or a lawyer?” 
“Absolutely,” he said. 

“No matter what?” 

“No matter what.” 

I watched him when he said 
it. I believed him. 

“Pick up your mpney,” I said. 
“You’re on.” 

He didn’t do it. He said, 
“As you remarked a minute ago, 
that is up to me. You can’t buy 
these treatments like a candy bar. 
We have to work together. If 
either one of us can’t do that, 
it’s useless. You can’t walk in 
on the first psychotherapist you 
find in the phone book and make 
any demand that occurs to you 
just because you can pay for it.” 
I said tiredly, “I didn’t get you 
out of the phone book and I’m 
not just guessing that you can 
help me. I winnowed through a 
dozen or more head-shrinkers be- 
fore I decided on you.” 

“Thanks,” he said, and it look- 
ed as if he was going to laugh at 
me, which I never like. “Winnow- 
ed, did you say? Just how?” 
“Things you hear, things you 



« 



GALAXY* SCIENCE FICTION 



read. Yen know. Vm sot saying, 
so just file that with my street 
address.” 

He looked at me for a long 
time. It was the first time he’d 
used those eyes on me for any- 
thing but a flash glance. Then he 
picked up the bill. " 

“What do I do first?” I de- 
manded. 

“What do you mean?” 

“How do we start?” 

“We started when you walked 
in here.” 

So then I had to laugh. “All 
right, you got me. All I had was 
an opening. I didn’t know where 
you would go from there, so I 
couldn't be there ahead of you.” 
“That’s very interesting,” Stern 
said. “Do you usually figure ev- 
erything out in advance?” 
“Always.” 

“How often are you right?” 

“All the time. Except — but I 
don’t have to tell you about no 
exceptions.” 

He really grinned this time. “I 
see. One of my patients h^s been 
talking.” 

“One of your ex-patients. Your 
patients don’t talk.” 

““I ask them not to. That ap- 
plies to you, too. What did you 
hear?” 

“That you know from what 
people say and do what they’re 
about to say an<i do, and that 
sometimes you let’m do it and 
sometimes you don’t. How did 



you learn to do that?” 

He thought a minute. “I guess 
I was born with an eye for details, 
and then let myself make enough' 
mistakes with enough people un- 
til I learned not to make too 
many more. How did you learn 
to do it?” 

I said, “You answer that and- 
I won’t have to come back here.” 
“You really don’t know?” 

“I wish I did. Look, this isn’t 
getting us anywhere, is it?” 

He shrugged. “Depends on 
where you want to go.” He 
paused, and I got the eyes full 
strength again. “Which thumb- 
nail description of psychiatry do 
you believe at the moment?” 

“I don’t get you.” 

S TERN slid open a desk draw- 
er and took out a blackened 
pipe. He smelled it, turned it over 
while looking at me. “Psychiatry 
attacks the onion of the self, re- 
moving layer after layer until 
it gets down to the little sliver of 
unsullied ego. Or: psychiatry 

drills like an oil well, down and 
sidewise and down again, through; 
all the muck and rock, until it 
strikes a layer that yields. Or: 
psychiatry grabs a handful of 
sexual motivations and throws 
them on the pinball-machine of 
your life, so they bounce on down 
against episodes. Want more?” 
I had to laugh. “That last one 
was pretty good.” 



BABY IS THREE

“That last one was pretty bad. 
They are all bad. They all try to 
simplify something which is com- 
plex by its very nature. The only 
thumbnail you’ll get from me is 
this: no one knows what’s really 
wrong with you but you; no one 
can find a cure for it but you; no 
one but you can identify it as a 
cure; and once you find it, no one 
but you can do anything about 
it.” 

“What are you here for?” 

“To listen.” 

“I don’t have to pay somebody 
no day’s wage every hour just to 
listen.” 

“True. But you’re convinced 
that I listen selectively.” 

“Am I ?” I wondered about it. 
“I guess I am. Well, don’t you?” 
“No, but you’lf never believe 
that.” 

I laughed. He asked me what 
that was for. I said, “You’re not 
calling me Sonny.” 

“Not you.” He shook his head 
slowly. He was watching me while 
he did it, so his eyes slid in their 
sockets as his head moved. “What- 
is it you want to know about 
yourself, that made you worried 
I might tell people?” 

“I want to find out why I killed 
somebody,” I said right away. 

It didn’t faze him a bit. “Lie 
down over there.” 

I got up. “On that couch?” 

-He nodded, 

As I stretched out self -con- 

• 9 



sciously, I said, “I feel like I’m 
in some damn cartoon.” 

“What cartoon?” 

“Guy’s built like a bunch of 
grapes,” I said, looking at the 
ceiling. It was pale gray. 
“What’s the caption?” 

“ ‘I got trunks full of ’em’.” 
“Very good,” he said quietly. 
I looked at him carefully. I 
knew then he was the kind of guy 
who laughs way down deep when 
he laughs at all. 

He said, “I’ll use that in a 
book of case histories some time. 
But it won’t include yours*. What 
made you throw that in?” When 
I didn’t answer, he got up and 
moved to a chair behind me 
where I couldn’t see him. “You 
can quit testing, Sonny. I’m good 
enough for your purposes.” 

I clenched my jaw so hard, my 
back teeth hurt. Then I relaxed, 
I relaxed all over. It was wonder- 
ful. “All right,” I said, “I’m sor- 
ry.” He didn’t say anything, but 
I had that feeling again that he 
was laughing. Not at me, though. 

“How old are you?” he asked 
me suddenly.' 

“Uh— fifteen” 

“Uh — fifteen,” he repeated. 
“What does the ‘uh’ mean?” 
“Nothing. I’m fifteen.” 

“When I asked your age, you 
hesitated because some other 
number popped up. You dis- 
carded that and substituted .‘fif- 
teen.’ ” 

M.AXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“The hell I did! I am fifteen!”' 

“I didn’t say you weren’t,” His 
voice came patiently. “Now what 
was the other number?” 

I got mad again. “There wasn’t 
any other number! What do you 
want to go pryin’ my grunts 
apart for, trying to plant this and 
that and make it mean what you 
think it ought to mean?” 

He was silent. 

“I’m fifteen,” I said defiantly, 
and then, “I don’t like being only 
fifteen. You know that. I’m not 
trying to insist I’m fifteen.” 

He just waited, still not saying 
anything. 

I felt defeated. “The number 
was eight.” 

“So you’re eight. And your 
name?” 

“Gerry.” I got up on one el- 
bow, twisting my neck around so 
I could see him. He had his pipe 
apart and was sighting through 
the stem at the desk lamp. “Ger- 
ry, without no ‘uh!’ ” 

“All right,” he said mildly, 
making me feel real foolish. 

I leaned back and closed my 
eyes. 

Eight, T thought. Eight. 

“It’s cold in here,” I com- 
plained. 

Eight. Eight, plate, state, hate. 
I ate from the plate of the state 
and I Tiate. I didn’t like any of 
that and I snapped my eyes open. 
The ceiling was still gray. It was 
all right. Stern was somewhere 



behind me with his pipe, and he 
was all right. I took two deep 
breaths, three, and then let my 
eyes close. Eight. Eight years old. 
Eight, hate. Years, fears. Old, 
cold, Damn it! I twisted and 
twitched on the couch, trying to 
find a way to keep the cold out. 
I ate from the plate of the — 

1 GRUNTED and with my 
mind I took all the eights 
and all the rhymes and every- 
thing they stood for, and made it 
all black. But it wouldn’t stay 
black. I had to put something 
there, so I made a great big lu- 
minous figure eight and just let 
it hang there. But it turned on 
its side and inside the loops it 
began to shimmer. It was like one 
of those movie shots through bi- 
noculars. I was going to have to 
look through whether I liked it 
or not. 

Suddenly I qYiit fighting it and 
let it wash over me. The binocu- 
lars came close, closer, and then 
I was there. 

Eight. Eight years old, cold. 
Cold as a bitch in the ditch. The 
ditch was by a railroad. Last 
year’s weeds were scratchy straw. 
The ground was red, and when 
it wasn’t slippery, clingy mud, it 
was frozen hard like a flowerpot. 
It was hard like that now, dusted 
with hoar-frost, cold as the win- 
ter light that pushed up over the 
hills. At night the lights were 

• f 



• AiY IS THREE 



warm, and they were all in other 
people’s houses. In the daytime 
the sun was in somebody else’s 
house too, for all the good it did 
me. 

I was dying in that ditch. Last 
night it was as good a place as 
any to sleep, and this morning it 
was as good a place as any to die. 
Just as well. Eight years old, the 
sick -sweet taste of pork-fat and 
wet bread from somebody’s gar- 
bage, the thrill of terror when 
you’re stealing a gunnysack and 
you hear a footstep. 

And I heard a footstep. 

I’d been curled up on my side. 
I whipped over on my stomach 
because sometimes they kick your 
belly. I covered my head with my 
arms and that was as far as I 
could get. 

After a while I rolled my eyes 
up and looked without moving. 
There was a big shoe there. There 
was an ankle in the shoe, and an- 
other shoe close by. I lay there 
waiting to get tromped. Not that 
I cared much any more, but it 
was such a damn shame. All these 
months on my own, and they’d 
never caught up with me, never 
even come close, and now this. 
It was such a shame I started to 
cry. 

- The shoe took me under the 
armpit, but it was not a kick. It 
rolled me over. I was so stiff 
from the cold, I went over like 
a plank. I just kept my arms over 



my face and head and .lay there 
with my eyes closed. For some 
reason I stopped crying. I think 
people only cry when there’s a 
chance of getting help from 
somewhere. 

When nothing happened, I 
opened my eyes and shifted my 
-forearms a little so I could see up. 
There was a man standing over 
me and he was a mile high. He 
had on faded dungarees and an 
old Eisenhower jacket with deep 
sweat-stains under the arms. His 
face was shaggy, like the guys 
who can’t grow what you could 
call a beard, but still don’t shave. 

He said, “Get up.’’ 

I looked down at his shoe, but 
he wasn’t going to kick me. I 
pushed up a little and almost fell 
down again, except he put his big 
hand where my back would hit 
it. I lay against it for a second 
because I had to, and then got up 
to where I had one knee on the 
ground. 

• “Come on,” he said. “Let’s go.” 

I swear I felt my bones creak, 
but I made it. I brought a round 
white stone up with me as I stood, 
I hefted the stone. ''I had to look 
at it to see if I was really holding 
it, my fingers were that cold. I 
told him, “Stay away from me or 
I’ll bust you in the teeth with this 
rock.” 

His hand came out and down 
so fast, I never saw the way he 
got one finger between my palm 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and the rock, and flicked it out of 
my grasp. I started to cuss at 
him, but he just turned his back' 
and walked up the embankment 
toward the tracks. He put his 
chin, on his shoulder and said, 
“Come on, will you?” 

H E didn’t chase me, so I didn’t 
run. He didn’t talk to me, so 
I didn’t argue. He didn’t hit me, 
so I didn’t get mad. I went along 
after him. He waited for me. He 
puF out his hand to me arid I 
spit at it. So he went on, up to 
the tracks, o«t of my sight. I 
clawed my way up. The blood 
was beginning to move in my 
hands and feet and they felt like 
four point-down porcupines. 
When I got up to the roadbed, 
the man was standing there wait- 
ing for me. 

The track was level just there, 
but as I turned my head to look 
along it, it seemed to be a hill 
that was steeper and steeper and 
turned over above me. And next 
thing you know, I was lying flat 
©n my back looking up at the 
cold sky. 

The man came over and sat 
down on the rail near me. He 
didn’t try to touch me. I gasped 
for breath a couple of times, .and 
suddenly felt I’d be all right if 
I could sleep for a minute — just 
a Tittle minute. I closed- my eyes. 
The man stuck his finger in my 
, ribs, hard. It hurt. 



“Don’t sleep,” he said, 

I looked at him. 

He said, “You’re frozen stiff 
and weak with hunger. I want to 
take you home and get you warm- 
ed up and fed. But it’s a long 
haul up that way, and you won’t 
make it by yourself. If I carry 
you, will that be the same to you 
as if you walked it?” 

“What are you going to do 
when you get me home?” 

“I told you.” 

“All right,” I said. 

He picked me up and carried 
me down the track. If he’d said 
anything else in the world, I’d 
of laid right down where I was 
until I froze to death. Anyway, 
what did he want to ask me for, 
one way or the other? I couldn’t 
of done anything. 

f stopped thinking about it 
and dozed off. 

I woke up once when he turn- 
ed off the right of, way. He dove 
into the woods. There was no 
path, but he seemed to know 
where he was going. The itex t 
time I woke from a crackling 
noise. He was carrying me over 
a frozen pond and the ice was 
giving under his feet. He didn’t 
hurry. I looked down and saw 
the white cracks raying out under 
his feet, and it didn’t seem to 
matter a bit. I bleared off again. 

He put me down at last. We 
were there. “There” was inside a 
room. It was very warm. He put

It 



me on my feet and I snapped out 
of it in a hurry. The first thing I 
looked for was the door. I saw it 
and jumped over there and put 
my back against the wall beside 
it, in case I wanted to leave., Then 
I looked around. 

It was a big room. One wall 
was rough rock and the rest was 
logs with stuff shoved between 
them. There was a big fire going 
in the rock wall, not in a fireplace, 
exactly; it was a sort of hollow 
place. There was an old auto 
battery on a shelf opposite, with 
two yellowing electric light bulbs 
dangling by wires from it. There 
was a table, some boxes and a 
couple of three-legged stools. The 
air had a haze of smoke and such 
a wonderful, heartbreaking, ean- 
dy-and-crackling smell of food 
that a little hose squirted inside 
my mouth. 

The man said. “What have I 
got here, Baby?” 

And the room was full of kids. 
Well, three of them, but somehow 
they seemed to be more than 
three kids. There was a girl about 
my age — eight, I mean — with 
blue paint on the side of her face. 
She had an easel and a palette 
with lots of paints and a fistful of 
brushes, but she. wasn’t using the 
brushes. She was smearing the 
paint on with her hands. Then 
there was a little Negro girl 
about five with great big eyes 
who stood gaping at me. And in 



a wooden crate, set up on two 
sawhorses to make a kind of 
bassinet, was a baby. I guess 
about three or four months old. 
It did what babies do, drooling 
some, making small bubbles, 
waving its hands around very 
aimless, and kicking. 

W HEN the man spoke, the girl 
at the easel looked at me 
and then at the baby. The baby 
just kicked and drooled. “ 

The girl said, “His name’s 
Gerry. He’s mad.” 

“What’s he mad at?” the man 
asked. He was looking at the - 
baby. 

“Everything,” said the girl, 
“Everything and everybody.” 
“Where’d he come from?” 

I said, “Hey, what is this?” but 
nobody paid any attention. The 
man kept asking questions at the 
baby and the girl kept answering. 
Craziest thing I ever saw. 

“He ran away from a state 
school,” the girl- said. “They fed 
him enough, but no one bleshed 
with him.” 

That’s what she said — ■ 
“bleshed.” 

I opened the door then and 
cold air hooted in. “You louse,” 

I said to the man, “you’re from 
the school.” 

“Close the door, Janie,” said 
the man. The girl at the easel 
didn’t move, but the door banged 
shut behind me. I tried to open

f - 

it and it wouldn’t move. I let out 
a howl, yanking at it. 

“I think yoti ought to stand in 
the comer,” said the man. “Stand 
him in the corner, Janie.” 

Janie looked at me. One of the 
three-legged stools sailed across 
' to me. It hung in midair and 
turned on its side. It nudged me 
with its fiat seat. I jumped back 
and it came after me. I dodged 
to the side, and that was the cor- 
ner. The stool came on. I tried 
to bat it down and just hurt my 
hand. I ducked and it went lower 
than I did. I put one hand on it 
and tried to vault over it, but it 
just fell and so did I. I got up 
again and stood in the corner, 
trembling. The stool turned right 
side up and sank to the floor in 
front of me. 

The man said, “Thank you, 
Janie.” He turned to me. “Stand 
there and be quiet, you. I’ll get 
to you later. You shouldn’ta 
kicked up all that fuss.” And 
then, to the baby, he said, “He 
got anything we need?” 

And again it was the little girl 
who answered. She said, “Sure. 
He’s the one.” 

“Well,” said the man. “What 
do you know!” He came over. 
“Gerry, you can live here. I don’t 
come from the school. I’ll never 
turn you in.” 

“Yeah, huh?” 

“He hates you,” said Janie. 

“What am I supposed ' to do 

IABY 



about that?” he wanted to know, 

Janie turned her head to look 
into the. bassinet. “Feed him.** 
The man nodded and began fid- 
dling around the fire. 

Meanwhile, the little Negro 
girl had been standing in the one 
spot with her big eyes right out 
on her cheekbones, looking at me. 
Janie went back to her painting 
and the baby just lay there same 
as always, so I stared right back 
at the little Negro girl. I snapped, 
“What the devil are you gawking 
at?” 

She grinned at me. “Gerry ho- 
bo,” she said, and disappeared. I 
mean she really disappeared, went 
out like a light, leaving hqr 
clothes where she "had been. Her 
little dress billowed in the air 
and fell in a heap where she had 
been, and that was that. She was 
gone. 

“Gerry hee-hee,” I heard. I 
looked up, and there she was, 
stark naked, wedged in a space 
where a little outcropping on the 
rock wall stuck out just below 
the ceiling. The second I saw her 
she disappeared again. 

“Gerry hb-ho,” she said. Now 
she was on top of the row of 
boxes they used as storage 
shelves, over ot\ the other side of 
the room. 

“Gerry hee-hee!” Now she was 
under the table. “Gerry ho-ho!’* 
This time she was right in the 
corner with me, crowding me.

I yelped and tried to get out 
of the way and bumped the stooL 
I was afraid of it, so I shrank 
back again and the little girl was 
gone. 

The man glanced over his 
shoulder from where he was 



working at the fire. “Cut it out, 
you kids,” he said. 

T HERE was a silence, and 
then the girl came slowly out 
from the bottom row of shelves. 
She walked across to her dress

and put it on. 

“How did you do that?” I 
wanted to know. 

“Ho-ho,” she said. 

Janie said, “It’s easy. She’s 
really twins.” 

“Oh,” I said. Then another girl, 
exactly the same, came from 
somewhere in the shadows and 
stood beside the first. They were 
identical. They stood side by 
side and stared at me. This time 
I let them stare. 

“That’s Bonnie and Beanie,** 
said the painter. “This is Baby 
and that — ” she indicated the 
man — “that’s Lone. And I’m 
Janie.” 

I couldn’t think of what to say, 
so I said, “Yeah.” 

Lone said, “Water, Janie.” He 
held up a pot. I heard water 
trickling, but didn’t see anything. 
“That’s enough,” he said, and 
hung the pot on a crane. He pick- 
ed up a cracked china plate and 
brought it over to me. It was full 
of stew with great big lumps of 
meat in it, and thick gravy and 
dumplings and carrots. “Here, 
Gerry. Sit down.” 

I looked at the stool. “On 
that?” 

“Sure.” 

“Not me,” I said. I took the 
plate and hunkered down against 
the wall. 

“Hey,” he said after a time. 
“Take it easy. We’ve all had 
chow. No one’s going to snatch it 



IS 



away from you. Slow down!** 

I ate even faster than before. 
I was almost finished when I 
threw it all up. Then for some 
reason my head hit the edge of 
the stool. I dropped the plate and 
spoon and slumped there. I felt 
real bad. 

Lone came over and looked at 
me. “Sorry, kid,” he said. “Clean 
up, will you, Janie?” 

Right in front of my eyes, the 
mess on the floor disappeared. I 
didn’t care about that or any- 
thing else just then. I felt the 
man’s hand on the side of my 
neck. Then he tousled my hair. 

“Beanie, get him a blanket. 
Let’s all go to sleep. He ought to 
rest a while.” 

I felt the blanket go around 
me, and I think I was asleep be- 
fore he put me down. 

I don’t know how much later 
it was when I woke up. I didn’t 
know where I was and that scared 
me. I raised my head and saw the 
dull glow of the embers in the 
fireplace. Lone was stretched out 
®n it in his clothes. Janie’s easel 
stood in the reddish blackness 
like some great preying insect. I 
saw the baby’s head pop 'up out 
of the bassinet, but I couldn’t 
tell whether he was looking 
straight at me or away. Janie 
was lying on the floor near the 
door and the twins were on the 
©Id table. Nothing moved except 
the baby’s head, bobbing a little. 



I got to my feet and looked 
around the room. Just a room, 
only the one door. I tiptoed to- 
ward it. When 1 passed Janie, she 
opened her eyes. 

“What’s the matter?” she 
whispered. 

“None of your business,” I told 
her. I went to the door as if I 
didn’t care, but I watched her. 
She didn’t do anything. The door 
was as solid tight closed as when 
I’d tried it before. 

J went back to Janie. She just 
looked up at me. She wasn’t 
scared. I told her, “I got to go to 
the john.” 

“Oh,” she said. “Why’n’t you 
say so?” 

Suddenly I grunted and grab- 
bed my guts. The feeling I had 
I can’t begin to talk abput. I 
acted as if it was a pain, but it 
wasn’t. It was like nothing else 
that ever happened to me before, 
“Okay,” Janie said. “Go on 
back to bed.” 

“But I got to—” 

“You got to what?” 

“Nothing.” It was true. I didn’t 
have to go no place. 

“Next time tell me right away. 
I don’t mind.” 

I didn’t say anything. I went 
back to my blanket. 

T HAT’S all?” said Stern. I 
lay on the couch and looked 
up at the gray ceiling. He asked, 
“How old are you?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



1 « 




' “Fifteen,” I said dreamily. He 
Waited until, for me, the gray 
ceiling acquired walls and a floor, 
a rug and lamps and a desk and 
a chair with Stern in it. I sat 
up and held my head a second, 
and then I looked at him. He was 
fooling with his pipe and looking 
at me. “What did you do to me?” 
“I told you. I don’t do any- 
thing here. You do it.” 

“You hypnotized me.” 

“I did not.” His voice was 
quiet, but he really meant it. 

“What was all that, then? It 
was . ..it was like it was happen- 
ing for real all over again.” 

“Feel anything?” 

“Everything.” I shuddered. 
'‘Every damn thing. What was 
it?” 

“Anyone doing it feels better 
afterward. You can go over it all 
again now any time you want to, 
, ■ and every time you do, the hurt 
in it will be less. You’ll see.” 

It was the first thing to amaze 
me in years. I chewed on it and 
then asked, “If I did it by myself, 
how come it never happened be- 
fore?” 

“It needs someone to listen.” 
, “Listen? Was I talking?” 

“A blue streak.” 

“Everything that happened?” 
“How can I know? I wasn’t 
r there. You were.” 

. “You don’t-believe it happened, 

do you? Those disappearing kids 
and the footstool and all?” 

I IABY IS THREE 



He shrugged. “I’m not in the 
business of believing or not be- 
lieving. Was it real to you?” 

“Oh, hell, yes!” 

“Well, then, that’s all that mat- 
ters. Is that where you live, with 
those people?” 

I bit off a fingernail that had 
been bothering me. “Not for a 
long time. Not since Baby was 
three.” I looked at him. “You re- 
mind me of Lone.” 

“Why?” 

“I don’t know. No, you don’t,” 
I added suddenly. “I don’t know 
what made me say that.” I lay 
down abruptly. 

The ceiling was gray and the 
lamps weft dim. I heard the pipe- 
stem click against his teeth. I lay 
there for a long time. 

“Nothing happens,” I told him, 

“What did you expect to hap- 
pen?” 

“Like before.” 

“There’s something there that 
wants out. Just let it come.” 

It was as if there was a re- 
volving drum in my head, and on 
it were photographed the places 
and things and people I was after. 
And it was as if the drum was 
spinning very fast, so fast I 
couldn’t tell one picture from 
another. I made it stop, and it 
stopped at a blank segment. I 
spun it again, and stopped • it 
again. 

“Nothing happens,”-! said. • 

“Baby is three;” he repeated. 

i t 



“Oh I said. “That.” I closed 
my eyes. 

That might be it. Might, sight, 
night, light. I might have the 
sight of a light in the night. May- 
be the baby. Maybe the sight of 
the baby at night because of the 
light ... 

T HERE was night after night 
when I lay on that blanket, 
and a lot of nights I didn’t. Some- 
thing was going on all the time 
in Lone’s house. Sometimes I 
slept in the daytime. I guess the 
only time everybody slept at once 
was when someone was sick, like 
me. the first time I arriyed there. 
It was always sort of dadk in the 
room, the same night and day, 
the fire going, the two old bulbs 
hanging yellow by their wires 
from the battery. When they got 
too dim, Janie fixed the battery 
and they got bright againr 

Janie did everything that need- 
ed doing, whatever no one else 
felt like doing. Everybody else 
did things, too. Lone was out a 
lot. Sometimes he used the twins 
to help him, but you never missed 
them, because they’d be here and 
gone and back again bing! like 
that. And Baby, he just stayed in 
his bassinet. 

I did things myself. I cut wood 
for the fire and I put up more 
shelves, and then I’d go swim- 
ming with Janie and the twins 
sometimes. And I talked to Lone. 



I didn’t do a thing that the others 
couldn’t do, but they all did 
things I couldn’t do, I was mad, 
mad all the time about that. But 
I wouldn’t of known what to do 
with myself if I wasn’t mad all 
the time about something or 
other. It didn’t keep us from 
bleshing, Bleshing, that was Jan- 
ie’s word. She said Baby told it 
to her. Sfie said it meant everyone 
all together being something, even 
if they all did different things. 
Two arms, two legs, one body, 
one head, all working together, 
although a head can’t walk and 
arms can’t think. Lone said may- 
be it was a mixture of “blending” 
and “meshing,” but I don’t think 
he believed that himself. It was 
a lot more than that. 

Baby talked all the time. He 
was like a broadcasting station 
that runs twenty-four hours a 
day, and you can get what it’s 
sending any time you'tune in, but 
it’ll keep sending whether you 
tune in or not. When I say he 
talked, I don’t mean exactly that. 
He semaphored mostly. You’d 
think those wandering, vague 
movements of his hands and arms 
and legs and head were meaning- 
less, but they weren’t. It was 
semaphore, only instead of a sym- 
bol for a sound, or such like, the 
movements were whole thoughts. 

I mean spread the left hand 
and shake the right high up, and 
thump with the left heel, and it

means, "Anyone who thinks a 
Marling is a pest just don’t kno# 
anything about how a starling 
thinks” or something like that. 

Lone couldn’t read the stuff 
and neither could I. The twins 
% could, but they didn’t give a 
damn. Janie used to watch him 
all the time. He always knew 
what you meant if you wanted 
to ask him something, and he’d 
tell Janie and she’d say what it 
was. Part of it, anyway. Nobody 
could get it all, not even Janie. 
Lone once told me that all babies 
know that semaphore. But when 
nobody receives it, they quit do- 
ing it and pretty soon they for- 
get. They almost forget. There’s 
always some left. That’s why cer- 
tain gestures are funny the world 
over, and certain others make 
you mad'. But like everything 
else Lone said, I don’t know 
whether he believed it or not. 

All I know is Janie would sit 
\ there and paint her pictures and 
watch Baby, and sometimes she’d 
bust out laughing, and sometimes 
she’d get the twins and make 
them watch and they’d laugh, 
too, or they’d wait til! he was 
finished what he was saying and 
then they’d creep off to a corner 
and whisper to each other about 
it. Baby never grew any. Janie 
did, and the twins, and so did I, 
-but not Baby. He just lay there. 

Janie kept his stomach full and 
cleaned him up every two or three 

KABY IS THREE 



days. He didn’t cry and he didn’t 
make any trouble. No one ever 
went near him. 

J ANIE showed every picture 
she painted to Baby, before 
she cleaned the boards and paint- 
ed new ones. She had to clean 
them because she only had three 
of them. It was a good thing, too, 
because I’d hate to think what 
that place would of been like if 
she’d kept them all; she did four 
or five a day. Lone and the twins 
were kept hopping getting tur- 
pentine for her. She could shift 
the paints back into the little 
pots on her easel without any 
trouble, just by looking at the 
picture one color at a time, but 
turps was something else again. 
She told me that Baby remem- 
bered all her pictures and that’s 
why she didn’t have to keep 
them. They were all pictures of 
machines and gear-trains and 
mechanical linkages and what 
ldbked like electric circuits and 
things like that. I never thought 
too much about them. 

I went out with Lone to get 
some turpentine and a couple of 
picnic hams, one time. We went 
through the woods to the railroad 
track and down a couple of miles 
to where we could see the glow of 
a town. Then the woods again, 
and some alleys, and a back 
street. 

Lone was like always, walking 

I* 



along, thinking, thinking. 

We came to a hardware store 
and he went up and looked at the 
lock and came back to where I 
was waiting, shaking his head. 
Then we found a general store. 
Lone grunted and we went and 
stood in the shadows by the door. 
I looked in. 

All of a sudden, Beanie was in 
there, naked like she always was 
whet) she traveled like that. She 
came and opened the door from 
the inside. We went in and Lone 
closed it and locked it. 

“Get along home, Beanie,” he 
said, “before you catch' your 
death.” 

She grinned at me and said, 
“Ho-ho,” and disappeared. 

We found a pair of fine hams 
and a two-gallon can of -turpen- 
tine. I took a bright yellow ball- 
point pen and Lone cuffed me 
and made me put it back. 

“We only take what we need,” 
he told me. 

After we left, Beanie came bafck 
and locked the door and went 
home again. I only went with 
Lone a few times, when he had 
more to- get than he could carry 
easily. 

I was there about three years. 
That’s all I can remember about 
it. Lone was there or he was out, 
and you could hardly tell the 
difference. The twins were with 
each other most of the time. I 
got to like Janie a lot, but we 



never talked much. Baby talked 
the time, only I don’t know 
what about. 

We were all bu«;y_ and we 
bleshed. 

T SAT up on the couch sud- 
denly. 

Stern said, “What’s the mat- 
ter?” 

“Nothing’s the matter. This 
isn’t getting me any place.” 

“You said that when you’d 
barely started. Do you think 
you’ve accomplished anything 
since then?’’ 

“Oh, yeah, but — ” 

“Then how can you be sure 
you’re right this time?” When I 
didn’t say anything, he asked 
me, “Didn’t you like this last 
stretch?” 

I said angrily, “I didn’t like or 
not like. It didn’t mean nothing. 
It was just — just talk.” 

“So what was the difference be- 
tween this last session and what 
happened before?” 

“My gosh, plenty! The first 
one, I felt everything. It was all 
really happening to. me. But this 
time — nothing.” 

“Why do you suppose that 
was?” 

“I don’t know. You tell me.” 
“Suppose,” he said thoughtfuf- 
ly, “that there was some episode 
so unpleasant to you that you 
wouldn’t dare relive it.” 

“Unplfeasant? You think freez-

4«g to death isn’t unpleasant?” 
“There are all kinds of unpleas- 
antness. Sometimes the very thing 
you’re looking for — the . thing 
that’ll clear up your trouble — is 
so revolting to you that you won’t 
go near it. Or you try to hide it. 
Wait,” he said suddenly, “may- 
be ‘revolting’ and ‘unpleasant’ are 
inaccurate words to use. It might 
be something very desirable fo 
you. It’s just that you don’t want 
to get straightened out.” 

“I want to get Straightened 
out.” 

He waited as if he had to clear 
something up in his mind, and 
then said, “There’s something in 
that ‘Baby is three’ phrase that 
bounces you away. Why is that?” 
“Damn if I know.” 

“Who said it?” 

“I dunno . .uh . .” 

He grinned. “Uh?” 

I grinned back at him.- “I said 
it.” 

“Okay. When?” 

I quit grinning. He leaned for- 
ward, then got up. 

“What’s the matter?” I asked. 
“I didn’t think anyone could 
be that mad.” I djdn’t say any- 
thing. He went over to his desk. 
“You don’t want to go on any 
more, do you?” 

“No.” 

“Suppose I told you you want 
to quit because you’re right on 
the very edge of finding out what 
you want to know?” 



“Why don’t you tell me and 
see what I do?” 

He just shook his head. “I’m 
not telling you anything. Go on, 
leave if you want to. I’ll give you 
back your change.” 

“How many people quit just 
when they’re on top of the an- 
swer?” 

“Quite a few.” 

“Well, I ain’t going to.” I lay 
down. 

.He didn’t laugh and he, didn’t 
say, “Good,” and he didn’t make 
any fuss about it: He just picked 
up his phone and said, “Cancel 
everything for this afternoon,” 
and went back to his chair, 'up 
there out of my sight. 

TT was very quiet in there. He 
*- had the place soundproofed. 

I said, “Why do you suppose 
Lone let me live there so long 
when I couldn’t do any of the 
things that the other kids could?” 
“Maybe you could.” 

“Oh, no,” I said positively. “I 
used to try. I was strong for ai 
kid my age and I knew how to 
keep my mouth shut, but aside 
from those two things I don’t 
think I was any different from 
any kid. I don’t think I’m any 
different right now, except what 
difference there might be from 
living with Lone and his bunch.” 
“Has this anything to do with 
‘Baby is three’?” 

I looked up at the gray ceiling. 



BABY IS THREE 



21 



■‘‘Baby is three. Baby is three. I 
went up to a big house with a 
winding drive that ran under a 
sort of theater-marquee thing. 
Baby is three. Baby . 

“How old are you?” 

“Thirty-three,” I said, and the 
next thing you know 1 was up 
off that couch like it was hot, and 
heading for the door. 

“Don’t be foolish,” Stern said. 
“Want me to waste a whole af- 
ternoon?” 

“What’s that to me? I’m pay- 
ing for it.” 

“All right, it’s up to you.” 

I went back. “I don’t like any 
part of this,” I said. 

“Good. We’re getting warm 
then.” 

“What made me say ‘Thirty- 
three?’ I ain’t thirty-three. I’m 
fifteen. And another thing . 

“Yes?” 

“It’s about that . ‘Baby is 
three.” It’s me saying it, all right. 
But when I think about it — it’s 
not my voice.” 

“Like thirty-three’s not your 
age?” 

“Yeah,” I whispered. 

“Ger»y,” he said warmly, 
“there’s nothing to be afraid of.” 

T REALIZED I was breathing 
•*- too hard. I pulled myself to- 
gether. I said, “I don’t like re- 
membering saying things in 
somebody else’s voice.” 

“Look,” he told me. “This 



head -shrinking business, as you 
called it a while back, isn’t what 
most people think. When I go with 
you into the world of your mind 
—or when you go yourself, for 
that matter — what we find isn’t 
so very different from the so- 
called real world. It seems so at 
first, because the patient comes 
out with all sorts of fantasies and 
irrationalities and weird experi- 
ences. But everyone lives in that 
kind of world. When one of the 
ancients coined the phrase ‘truth 
is stranger than fiction,’ he was 
talking about that. 

“Everywhere we go, everything 
we do, we’re surrounded by sym- 
bols, by things so familiar we 
don’t ever look at them or don’t 
see them if we do look. If anyone 
ever could report to you exactly 
what he saw and thought while 
walking ten feet down the street, 
you’d get the most twisted, cloud- 
ed, partial picture you ever ran 
across. And nobody ever looks at 
what’s around him with any kind 
of attention until he gets into a 
place like this. The fact that he’s 
looking at past events doesn’t 
matter; what counts is that he’s 
seeing clearer than he ever could

let slide that way. But consider: 
all your thinking is done in code 
and you have the key to only 
about a tenth of it. So you run 
into a stretch of code which is 
abhorrent to you. Can’t you see 
that the only way you’ll find the 
key to it is to stop avoiding it?” 

“You mean I’d started to re- 
member with . with somebody 
else’s mind?” 

“It looked like that to you for 
a while, which means something. 
Let’s try to find out what.” 

“All right.” I felt sick. I felt 
tired. And I suddenly realized 
that being sick and being tired 
was a way of trying to get out of 
it. 

“Baby is three,” he said. 

Baby is maybe. Me, three, 
thirty-three, me, you Kew you. 

“Kew!” I yelled. Stern didn’t 
say anything. “Look, I don’t 
know why, but I think I know 
how to get to this, and this isn’t 
the way. Do you mind if I try 
something else?”. 

“You’re the doctor,” he said. 

■ • I had to laugh. Then I closed 
my eyes. 

f-M ''HERE, through the edges of 
the hedges, the ledges and 
wedges of windows were shoul- 
dering up to the sky. The lawns 
were sprayed-on green, neat and 
dean, and all the flowers looked 
as if they were afraid to let their 
petals break and be untidy. 



I walked up the drive in my 
shoes. I’d had to wear shoes and 
my feet couldn’t breathe. I didn’t 
want to go to the house, but I had 
to. 

I went up the steps between the 
big white columns and looked at 
the door. I wished I could see 
through it, but it was too white 
and thick. There was a window 
the shape of a fan over it, too 
high up, though, and a window on 
each side of it, but they were all 
crudded up with colored glass. 
I hit on the door with my hand 
and left dirt on it. 

Nothing happened, so I hit it 
again. It got snatched open and 
a tall, thin colored woman stood 
there. “What you wait?” 

I said I had to see Miss Kew. 
“Well, Miss Kew don’t want to 
see the likes of you,” she said. 
She talked too loud. “You got a 
dirty face.” ~ 

I started to get mad then. I 
was already pretty sore about 
having "to come here, walking 
around near people in the day- 
time and all. I said, “My face 
ain’t got nothin’ to do with it. 
Where’s Miss Kew? Go on, find 
her for me.” 

She gasped. “You can’t speak 
to me like that!” 

I said, “I didn’t want to speak 
to you like any way. Let me in.” 
I started wishing for Janie. Janie 
could of moved her. But I had to 
handle it by myself. I wasn’t do-

ing so hot, either. She slammed 
the door before I could so much 
as curse at her. 

So I started kicking on the 
door. For that, shoes are great. 
After a while, she snatched the 
door open agai%so sudden I al- 
most went on my can. She had a 
broom with her. She screamed at 
me, “You get away from here, 
you trash, or I’ll call the police!” 
She pushed me and I fell. 

I got up off the porch floor and 
went for her. She stepped back 
and whupped me one with the 
broom as I went past, but any- 
how I was inside now. The wo- 
man was making little shrieking 
noises and coming for me. I took 
the broom away from her and 
then somebody said, “Miriam!” 
in a voice like a grown goose. 

I froze and the woman went 
into hysterics. “Oh, Miss Kew, 
look out! He’ll., kill us all. Get the 
police. Get the — ” 

“Miriam!” came the honk, and 
Miriam dried up. 

There at the top of the stairs 
was this prune-faced woman with 
a dress on that had lace on it. 
She looked a lot older than she 
was, maybe because she held her 
mouth so tight. I guess she was 
about thirty-three — thirty- three. 
She had mean eyes and a small 
nose. 

I asked, “Are you Miss Kew?” 

“I am. What is the meaning of 
this invasion?” 



“I got to talk to you. Miss 
Kew.” 

“Don’t say ‘got to.’ Stand up 
straight and speak out.” 

The maid said, “I’ll get the 
police.” 

Miss Kew turned on her. 
“There’s time enough for that, 
Miriam. Now, you dirty little 
boy, what do you want?” 

“I got to speak to you by your- 
self,” I told her. 

“Don’t you let him do it, Miss 
Kew,” cried the maid. 

“Be quiet, Miriam. Little boy, 
I told you not to say ‘Got to.’ 
You may say whatever you have 
to say in front of Miriam.” 

“Like hell.” They both gasped. 
I said, “Lone told me not to.” 

“Miss Kew, are you goin’ to 
let him — ” 

“Be quiet, Miriam! Young 
man, you will keep a civil — ” 
Then her eyes popped up real 
round. “Who did you say . .” 

“Lone said so.” 

“Lone.” She stood there on the 
stairs looking at hef hands. Then 
she said, “Miriam, that will be 
all.” And you wouldn’t know it 
was the same woman, the way 
she said it. 

The maid opened her mouth, 
but Miss Kew stuck out a finger 
that might as well of had a rifle- 
sight on the end of it. The maid 
beat it. 

“Hey,” I said, “here’s your 
broom.” I was just going to

tHrow it, but Miss Kew got to me 
and took it out of my hand. 

• “In there,” she said. 



S HE made me go ahead of her 
into a room as big as our 
swimming hole. It had books all 
over and leather on top of the 
tables, with gold flowers drawn 
into the corners. 

She pointed to a chair. “Sit 
there. No, wait a moment.” She 
went to the fireplace and got a 
newspaper out of a box and 
brought it over and unfolded it 
on the seat of the chair. “Now sit 
down.” 

I sat on the paper and she 
dragged up another chair, but 
didn’t put no paper on it. 

“What is it? Where is Lone?” 
“He died,” I said. 

She pulled in her breath and 
went white. She stared at me 
until her eyes started to water. 

“You sick?” I asked her. “Go 
ahead, throw up. It’ll make you* 
feel better.” 

“Dead? Lone is dead?” 

“Yeah. There was a flash flood 
last week and when he went out 
the next night in that big wind, 
he walked under a old oak tree 
that got gullied under by the 
flood. The tree come down on 
him.” 

“Came down on him,” she 
whispered. “Oh, no . it’s not 
true.” 

“It’s true, all right. We planted 



him this morning. We couldn’t 
keep him around no more. He 
■was beginning to st — ” 

“Stop!” She covered her face 
with her hands. 

“What’s the matter?” 

“I’ll be all right in a moment,” 
she said in a low voice. She went 
and stood in front of the fireplace 
with her back to me. I took off 
one of my shoes while I was 
waiting for her to cpme back. 
But instead she talked from 
where she was. “Are you Lone’s 
little boy?” 

“Yeah. He told me to come to 
you.” 

“Oh, my dear child!” She came 
running back and I thought for 
a second she was going to pick 
me up or something, but she 
stopped short and wrinkled up 
her nose a little bit. “Wh-what’s 
your name?” 

“Gerry,” I told her. 

“Well, Gerry, how would you 
like to live with me in this nice 
big house and — and have new 
clean clothes — and everything?” 
“Well, that’s the whole idea. 
Lone told me to come to you. He 
said you got more dough than 
you know what to do with, and 
he said you owed him a favor.” 
“A favor?” That seemed to 
bother her. 

“Well,” I tried to tell her, “he 
said he done something for you 
once and you said some day 
you’d pay him back for it if you 



ever could. This is it.” 

“What did he tell you about 
that?” She’d got her honk back 
by then. 

“Not a damn thing.” 

“Please don’t use that word,” 
she said, with her eyes closed. 
Then she opened them and nod- 
ded her head. “I promised and 
I’ll do it. You can live here from 



now on. If — if you want to.” 
“That’s got nothin’ to do with 
it. Lone told me to.” 

“You’ll be happy here,” she 
said. She gave me an up-and- 
down. “I'll see to that.” 

“Okay. Shall I go get the other 
kids?” 

“ Other kids — children?” 

“Yeah. This ain’t for just me. 




For all of us — the whole gang.” 
"Don’t say ‘ain’t.’ ” She leaned 
back in her chair, took out a 
silly little handkerchief and dab- 
bed her lips with it, looking at 
me the whole time. ‘‘Now tell me 
about these — these other chil- 
dren.” ' 

“Well, there’s Janie, she’s elev- | 
en like me. And Bonnie and 




Beanie are eight, they’re twins, 
and Baby. Baby is three.” 

“Baby is three,” she said. 

T SCREAMED. Stern was kneel- 
ing beside the couch in a flash, 
holding hfs palms against my 
cheeks to hold my head still; I’d 
been whipping it back and forth. 

“Good boy,” he said. “You 
found it. You haven’t found out 
what it is, but now you know 
where it is.” 

“But for sure,” I said hoarsely. 
“Got water?” 

He poured me some water out 
of a thermos flask. It was so cold 
it hurt. I lay back and rested, 
like I’d climbed a cliff. I said, “I 
can’t take anything like that 
again.” 

“You want to call it quits for 
today?” 

“What about you?” 

“I’ll go on as long as you want 
me to.” 

I thought abput it. “I’d like to 
go on, but I don’t want no thump- 
ing around. Not for a while yet.’* 

“If you want another of those 
inaccurate analogies,” Stern said, 
“psychiatry is like a road map. 
There are always a lot of different 
ways to get from one place to 
another place.” 

“I’ll go around by the long 
way,” I told him. “The eight-lane 
highway. Not that track over th<T 
hill. My clutch is slipping. Where 
do I turn off?”

He thupkled. I liked the sound 
of it. “Just past that gravel drive- 
way." 

“I been there. There’s a bridge 
washed out.” 

“You’ve been on this whole 
road before,” he told me. “Start 
at the other side of the bridge.” 
“I never thought ®f that. I 
figured I had to do the whole 
thing, every inch.” 

“Maybe you won’t have to, 
maybe you will, but the bridge 
will be easy to cross when you’ve 
covered everything else. Maybe 
there’s nothing of value on the 
bridge and maybe there is, but 
you can’t get near it till you’ve 
looked everywhere else.” 

“Let’s go.” I was real eager, 
somehow. 

“Mind a suggestion?” 

“No." 

“Just talk,” he said. “Don’t try 
to get too far into what you’re 
saying. That first stretch, when 
you were eight — you really lived 
it. The second one, all about the 
kids, you just talked about. Then, 
the visit .when you were eleven, 
you felt that. Now just talk 
again.” 

‘*A11 right.” 

He waited, then said quietly, 
“In the library. You told her 
about the other kids.” 

TOLD her about . and 
.then she said . and some- 
thing happened, and I screamed. 



She comforted me and I cussed 
at her. , 

But we’re not thinking about 
that now. We’re going on. 

In the library. The leather, the 
table, and whether I’m able to do 
with Miss Kew what Lone said. 

What Lone said was, “There’s 
a woman lives up on the top of 
the hill in the Heights section, 
name of Kew. She’ll have to take 
care of you. You got to get her 
to do that. Do everything she 
tells you, only stay together. 
Don’t you ever let any one of 
you get awdy from the others, 
hear? Aside from that, just you 
keep Miss Kew happy and she’ll 
keep you happy. Now you do 
what I say.” That’s what Lone 
said. Between every word there 
was a link like steel cable, and 
the whole thing made something 
that couldn’t be broken. Not by 
me it couldn’t. 

Miss Kew said, “Where are 
your sisters and the baby?” 

“I’ll bring ’em.” 

“Is it near here?” 

“Near enough.” She didn’t say 
anything to that, so I. got up. “I’ll 
be back soon.” 

“Wait,” she said. “I — really, I 
haven’t had time to think. I 
mean — I’ve got to get things 
ready, you know.” 

I said, “You don’t need to 
think and you are ready. So- 
long.” 

From the door I heard • her

laying, louder and louder as I 
walked away, “Young man, if 
you’re to live in this house, you’ll 
learn to be a good deal better- 
mannered — ” and a lot more of 
the same. 

I yelled back at her, “Okay, 
okay!’’ and went out. 

The sun was warm and the sky 
was good, and pretty soon I got 
back to Lone’s house. The fire 
was out and Baby stunk. Janie 
had knocked over her easel and 
was sitting on the floor by the 
door with her head in her hands. 
Bonnie and Beanie were on a 
stool with their arms around each 
other, pulled up together as close 
as they could get. as if it was cold 
in there, although it wasn’t. 

I hit Janie in the arm to snap 
her out of it. She raised her head. 
She had gray eyes — or maybe it 
was more a kind of green — but 
now they had a funny look about 
them, like water in a glass that 
had some milk left in the bottom 
of it. 

I saidf “What’s the matter 
around here?” 

“What’s the matter with 
what?” she wanted to know. 

“All of yez,” I said. 

She said, "We don’t give a 
damn, that’s all.” 

“Well, all right,” I said, “but 
yue got to do what Lone said. 
Gome on.” 

“No.” I looked at the twins. 
They turned their backs on me. 



Janie said, “They’re hungry.” 

“Well, why not give ’em some- 
thing?” 

She just shrugged. I sat down. 
What did Lone have to go get 
himself squashed for? 

“We, can’t blesh no more,” said 
Janie. It seemed to explain every- 
thing. 

“Look,” I said, “I’ve got to be 
Lone now.” 

Janie thought about that, and 
Baby kicked his feet. Janie look- 
ed at him. “You can’t,” she said. 

“I know where to get the heavy 
food, and the turpentine,” I said. 
“I can find that springy moss to 
stuff in the logs, and cut wood, 
and all.” 

But I couldn’t call Bonnie and 
Beanie from miles away to unlock 
doors. I couldn’t just say a word 
to Janie and make her get water 
and blow up the fire and fix the 
battery. I couldn’t make us blesh. 

We all stayed like that for a 
long time. Then I heard the bas- 
sinet creak. I looked up. Janie 
was staring into it. 

“All right,” she said. “Let’s go.” 

“Who says so?” 

“Baby.” 

“Who’s running things now?” 
I said, mad. “Me or Baby?” 

“Baby,” Janie said. 

I got up and went over to bust 
her one in the mouth, and then I 
stopped. If Baby could make 
them do what Lone wanted, then 
it would get done. If I started

pushing them alt around, it 
wouldn’t. So I didn’t say any- 
thing. Janie got up and walked 
out the door. The twins watched 
her go. Then Bonnie disappeared. 
Beanie picked up Bonnie’s clothes 
and walked out. I got Baby out 
of the bassinet and draped him 
over my shoulders, 

I T was better when we were all 
outside. It was getting late in 
•the day and the air was warm. 
The twins flitted in and out of 
the trees like a couple of flying 
squirrels, and Janie and I walked 
along like we were going swim- 
ming or something. Baby started 
to kick, and Janie looked at him 
a while and got him fed, and he 
was quiet again. 

When we came close to town. 
I wanted to get everybody close 
together, but I was afraid to say 
anything. Baby must of said it 
instead. The twins came back to 
us and Janie gave them their 
clothes and they walked ahead 
of us, good as you please. I don’t 
know how Baby did it. The# sure 
hated to travel that way. 

We didn’t have no trouble ex- 
cept one guy we met on the street 
near Miss Kew’s place. He stop- 
ped in his tracks and gaped at 
us, and Janie looked at him and 
made his hat go so far down over 
his eyes that he like to pull his 
neck apart getting it back up 
♦gain. 



What do you know, when we 
got to the house somebody had 
washed off all the dirt I’d put on 
the door. I had one hand on 
Baby’s arm and one on his ankle 
and him draped over my neck, 
so I kicked the door and left some 
more, dirt. 

“There’s a woman here name 
of Miriam,” I told Janie. “She 
says anything, tell her to go to 

hell.” 

The door opened and there was 
Miriam. She took one look and 
jumped back six feet. We all 
trailed inside, Miriam got her 
wind and screamed, “Miss Kew! 
Miss Kew!” 

“Go to hell,” said Janie, and 
looked’at me. I didn’t know what 
to do. It was the first time Janie 
ever did anything I told her to. 

Miss Kew came down the 
stairs. She was wearing a different 
dress, but it was just as stupid 
and had just as much lace. She 
opened her mouth and nothing 
came out, so she just left it open 
until something happened. Final- 
ly she said, “Dear gentle Lord 
preserve us!” 

The twins lined up and gawked 
at her. Miriam sidled over to the 
wall and sort of slid along it, 
keeping away from us, until she 
could get to the door and close it. 
She said, “Miss Kew, if those are 
the children you said were going 
to live here, I quit.” 

Janie said, “Go to hell.”

Just then, Bonnie squatted 
down on the rug. Miriam squawk- 
ed and jumped at her. She. grab- 
bed hold ©f Bonnie’s arm and 
went to snatch her up. Bonnie 
disappeared, leaving Miriam with 
One small dress and the damned- 
est expression on her face. Beanie 
grinned enough to split her head 
in two and started to wave like 
mad. I looked ‘where she was 
waving, and there was Bonnie, 
naked as a jaybird, up on the 
banister at the top of the stairs. 

Miss Kew turned around and 
saw .her and sat down plump on 
the steps. Miriam went down, 
too, like she’d been slugged. 
Beanie picked up Bonnie’s dress 
and walked up the steps past 
Miss Kew and handed it over. 
Bonnie put it on. Miss Kew sort 
of lolled around and looked up. 
Bonnie and Beanie came back 
down the stairs hand in hand to 
where I was. Then they lined up 
and gaped at Miss Kew. 

“What’s the matter with her?” 
Janie asked me. 

“She gets sick every once in a 
while.” 

“Let’s go back home.” 

“No,” I told her. 

•JLjTSS KEW grabbed the ban- 
nister and pulled herself up. 
She stood there hanging on to it 
for a while with her eyes closed. 
All of a sudden she stiffened her- 
•elf. She looked about four inches 



taller. She came marching over to 
us. 

“Gerard,” she honked. 

I think she was going to say 
something different. But she sort 
of checked herself and pointed. 
“What in heaven’s name is that?” 
And she aimed her finger at me. 

I didn’t get it right Sway, so I 
turned around to look behind 
me. “What?” 

“That! That!” 

“Oh!” I said. “That’s Baby.” 

I slung him down off my back 
and held him up for her to look 
at. She made a sort of moaning 
noise and jumped over and took 
him away from me. She held him 
out in front of her and moaned 
again and called him a poor little 
thing, and ran and put him down 
on a long bench thing with 
cushions under the colored-glass 
window. She bent over him and 
put her knuckle in her mouth and 
bit on it and moaned some more. 
Then she turned to me. 

“How long has he been like 
this?” 

I looked at Jane and she looked 
at me. I said, “He’s always been 
like he is.” 

She made a sort of cough and 
ran to where Miriam was lying 
flaked on the floor. She slapped 
Miriam’s face a couple of times 
back and forth. Miriam sat up 
and looked us over. She closed 
her eyes and shivered and sort of 
climbed up Miss Kew hand over

hand until she was on her feet. 

“Pull yourself together,” said 
Miss Kew between her teeth. 
“Get a basin with some hot water 
and soap. Washcloth. Towels. 
Hurry!” She gave Miriam a big 
push. .Miriam staggered and grab- 
bed at the wall, and then ran out. 

Miss Kew went back to Baby 
and hung over him, titch-titching 
with her lips all tight. 

“Don’t mess with him,” I said. 
“There’s nothin’ wrong with him. 
.We’re hungry.” 

She gave me a look like I’d 
punched her. “Don’t speak to 
me!” 

“Look,” I said.' “we don’t like 
this any more’n you do. If Lone 
hadn’t told us to, we wouldn’t 
never have come. We were doing 
all right where we were.” ’ 

“Don’t say ‘wouldn’t never,’ ” 
said Miss Kew. She looked at all 
of us, one by one. Then she took 
that silly little hunk of handker- 
chief and pushed it against her 
mouth. 

“See?” I said to Janie. “All the 
time gettin’ sick.” 

“Ho-ho,” said Bonnie. 

Miss Kew gave her a long look. 
“Gerard,” she said in a choked 
sort of voice, “I understood you 
to say that these children were 
your sisters.” 

. “Well?” 

She looked at me as if I was 
»eal stupid. “We don’t have little 
colored girls for sisters, Gerard.”

Janie said, “We do.” 

Miss Kew walked up and back, 
real fast. “We have a great deal 
to do,” she said, talking to her- 
self. 

Miriam came in with a big oval 
pan and towels and stuff on her 
acm. She put it down on the 
bench thing and Miss Kew stuck 
the back of her hand in the water, 
then picked up Baby and dunked 
him right in it. Baby started to 
kick. .< 

I stepped forward and said 
“Wait a minute. Hold on now. 
What do you think you're 
doing?” 

Janie said, “Shut up, Gerry. He 
says it’s all right.” 

“All right? She’ll drowned 
him.” 

“No, she won’t. Just shut up.” 

W ORKING up a froth with 
the soap, Miss Kew smear- 
ed it on Baby and turned him 
over a couple of times and scrub- 
bed at his head and like to 
smothered him in a big white 
towel. Miriam stood gawking 
while Miss Kew lashed up a 
dishcloth around him so it come 
out pants. When she was done, 
you wouldn’t of known it was the 
same baby. And by the time Miss 
Kew finished with the job, she 
seemed to have a better hold on 
herself. She was breathing hard 
arid her mouth was even tighter. 
She held out the baby to Miriam. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Take this poor thing,” she 
said, “and put him — ” 

But Miriam backed away. “I’m 
sorry, Miss Kew, but I am leav- 
ing here and I don’t care.” 

Miss Kew got her honk out. 
“You can’t leave me in a predica- 
ment like this! These children 
need help. Can’t you see that for 
yourself?” 

Miriam looked me and Janie 
over. She was trembling. “You 
ain’t safe. Miss Kew. They ain’t, 
just dirty. They’re crazy!” 
“They’re victims of neglect, 
and probably no worse than you 
or I would be if we’d been neglec- 
ted. And don’t say ‘ain’t.’ 
Gerard!” 

“What?” 

“Don’t say — oh, dear, we have 
so, much to do. Gerard, if 
you and your — these other chil- 
dren are going to live here, you 
shall have to make a great many 
changes. You cannot live under 
this roof and behave as you have 
so far. Do you understand that?” 
“Oh, sure. Lone said we was to 
do whatever you say and keep 
you happy.” 

“Will you do whatever I 
say?” 

“That’s what I just said, isn’t 
it?” 

“Gerard, you shall have to 
learn not to speak to me in that 
tone. Now, young man, if I told 
you to do what Miriam says, too, 
would you do it?” 



I said to Jane, “What about 
that?” 

“I’ll ask Baby.” Janie looked 
at Baby and Baby wobbled his 
hands and drooled some. She 
said, “It’s okay.” 

Miss Kew said, “Gerard, I 
asked you a question.” 

“Keep your pants on,” 1 said. 
“I got to find out, don’t I? Yes, 
if that’s what you want, we’ll 
listen to Miriam, too.” 

Miss Kew turned to Miriam. 
“You hear that, Miriam?” 

Miriam looked at Miss Kew 
and at us and shook her head. 
Then she held out her hands a bit 
to Bonnie and Beanie. 

They went right to her. Each 
one took hold of a hand. They 
looted up at her and grinned. 
They were probably planning 
some sort of hellishness, but I 
guess they looked sort of cute. 
Miriam’s mouth twitched -and I 
thought for a second she was 
going to look human. She said, 
“All right. Miss Kew.” 

Miss Kew walked over and 
handed her the baby and she 
started upstairs with him. Miss 
Kew herded us along after Mir- 
iam. We all went upstairs. 

They went to work on us then 
and for three years they never 
stopped. 

T HAT was hell,” I said .to 
Stern. 

“They had their work cut out,”

“Yeah, I s’pose they did. So 
did we. Look, we were going to do 
exactly what Lone said. Nothing 
on earth could of stopped us 
from doing it. We were tied and 
bound to doing every last little 
thing Miss Kew said to do. But 
she and Miriam never seemed to 
understand that. I guess they felt 
they had to push every inch of 
the way. All they had to do was 
make us understand what they 
wanted, and we’d of done it. 
That's okay when it’s something 
like telling me not to climb into 
bed with Janie. 

“Miss Kew raised holy hell over 
that. You’d of thought I’d robbed 
the Crown Jewels, the way she 
acted. But when it’s something 
like, ‘You must behave like little 
ladies and gentlemen,’ it just 
doesn’t mean a thing. And two 
out of three orders she gave us 
were like that. ‘Ah-ah!’ she’d 
say. ‘Language, language!’ For 
the longest time I didn’t dig that 
at all. I finally asked her what 
the hell she meant, and then she 
finally came out with it. But you 
see what I mean.” 

“I certainly do,” Stern said. 
“Did it get easier as time went 
on?” 

“We only had real trouble 
twice, once about the twins and 
once about Baby. That one was 
real bad.” 

“What happened?” 

“About the twins? Well, when 



we’d been there about a week or 
so we began to notice something 
that sort of stunk. Janie and me, 
I mean. We began to notice 
that we almost never got to see 
Bonnie and Beanie. It was like 
that house was two houses, one 
part for Miss Kew and Janie and 
me, and the other part for Miriam 
and the twins. I guess we’d have 
noticed it sooner if things hadn’t 
been such a hassel at first, getting 
us into new clothes and making 
us sleep all the time at night, and 
all that. But here was the thing: 
We’d all get turned out in the 
side yard to play, and then along 
comes lunch, and the twins got 
herded off to eat with Miriam 
while we ate with Miss Kew. So 
Janie said, ‘Why don’t the twins 
eat with us?’ 

“ ‘Miriam's taking care of 
them, dear,’ Miss Kew says. 

“Janie looked at her with those 
eyes. ‘I know that. Let ‘em eat 
here and I’ll take care of ‘em.’ 

“Miss Kew’s mouth got all 
tight again and she said, ‘They’re 
little colored girls, Jane. Now 
eat your lunch.’ 

“But that didn’t explain any- 
thing to Jane or me, either. I said, 
‘I want ‘em to eat with us. Lone 
said we should stay together.’ 

“ ‘But you ate together,’ she 
says. ‘We all live in the same 
house. We all eat the same food. 
Now let us ndt discuss the mat- 
ter.’

“I looked at Janie and she 
Hooked at me, and she said, ‘So 
why can’t we all do this livin’ 
and eatin’ right here?” 

“Miss Kew put down her fork 
and looked hard. ‘I have explain- 
ed it to you and I have said that 
there .will be no further discus- 
sion.’ 

“Well, I thought that was real 
nowhere. So I just rocked back 
lhy head and bellowed, “Bonnie! 
Beanie!” And hing, there they 
were. 

“So all hell broke loose. Miss 
Kew ordered them out and they 
wouldn’t go, and Miriam come 
steaming in with their clothes, 
and she couldn’t catch them, and 
Miss Kew got to honking at them 
and finally at me. She said this 
was too much. Well, maybe she 
had had a hard week, but so had 
we. So Miss Kew ordered us to 
leave. 

“I went and got Baby and start- 
ed out, and along came Janie 
and the twins. Miss Kew waited 
till we were all out the door and 
next thing you know she ran out 
after us. She passed us and got in 
front of me and made me stop. 
So we all stopped. 

“‘Is this how you follow 
Lone’s wishes?’ she asked. 

*‘I told her yes. She said she 
understood Lone wanted us to 
Stay with her. And I said, ‘Yeah, 
but he wanted us to stay together 
more.’ 

IASY IS THREE 



“She said come back in, we’d 
have a talk. Jane asked Baby and 
Baby said okay, so we went back. 
We had a compromise. We didn’t 
eat in the dining room no more. 
There was a side porch, a sort 
of verandah thing with glass 
windows, with a door to the din- 
ing room and er door to the kit- 
chen, and we all ate out there 
after that. Miss Kew ate by her- 
self. 

“But something funny happen- 
ed because of that whole cock- 
eyed hassel.” 

HAT Was that?” Stem 
asked me. 

I laughed. “Miriam. She looked 
and sounded like always, but she 
started slipping us cookies be- 
tween meals. You know, it took 
me years to figure out what all 
that was about. I mean it. From 
what I’ve learned about people, 
there seems to be two armies 
fightin’ about race. One’s fightin 
to keep 'em apart, and one’s 
fightin’ to get 'em together. But 
I don’t see why both sides are so 
worried about it! Why don’t they 
just forget it?” 

“They can’t You see, Gerry, 
it’s necessary for people to believe 
they are superior in some fashion. 
You and Lone and the kids--* 
you were a pretty tight unik 
Didn’t you feel you were a little 
better than all of the rest of the 
world?”

“Better? How could we be 
better?” 

“Different, then.” 

“Well, I suppose so, but we 
didn’t think about it. Different, 
yes. Better, no.” 

“You’re a unique case,” Stem 
said. “Now go on and tell me 
about the other trouble you had. 
About Baby.” 

“Baby. Yeah. Well, that was a 
couple of months after we moved 
to Miss Kew’s. Things were al- 
ready getting real smooth, even 
then. We’d learned all the ‘yes, 
ma’am, no, ma’am’ routines by 
then and she’d got us catching up 
with school — regular periods 
morning and afternoon, five days 
a week. Jane had long ago quit 
taking care of Baby, and the 
twins walked to wherever they 
went. That was funny. They 
could pop from one place to an- 
other right in front of Miss Kew’s 
eyes and she wouldn’t believe 
what she saw. She was too upset 
about them suddenly showing up 
bare. They quit doing it and she 
was happy about it. She was 
happy about a lot of things. It 
had been years since she’d seen 
anybody — years. She’d even had 
the meters put outside the house 
so no one would ever have to 
come in. But with us there, she 
began to liven up. She quit wear- 
ing those old-lady dresses and be- 
gan to look halfway human. She 
ate with us sometimes, even.

“But one fine day I woke up 
feeling real weird. It was like 
somebody had stolen something 
from me when I was asleep, only 
I didn’t know what. I crawled 
out of my window and along the 
ledge into Janie’s room, which I 
wasn’t supposed to do. She was in 
bed. I went and woke her up. I 
can still see her eyes, the way 
they opened a little slit, still 
asleep, and then popped up wide. 
I didn’t have to tell her some- 
thing was wrong. She knew, and 
she knew what it was. 

“ ‘Baby’s gone!’ she said. 

“We didn’t care then who woke 
up. We pounded out of her room 
and down the hall and into the 
little room at the end where Baby 
slept. You wouldn’t believe it. 
The fancy crib he had, and the 
white chest of drawers, and all 
that mess of rattles and so on, 
they were gone, and there was 
just a writing desk there. I mean 
it was as if Baby had never been 
there at all. 

“We didn’t say anything. We 
just spun around and busted into 
Miss Kew’s bedroom. I’d never 
been in there but once and Jane 
only a few times. But forbidden 
or not, this was different. Miss 
Kew was in bed, with her hair 
braided. She was wide awake 
before we could get across the 
room. She pushed herself back 
and up until she was sitting 
against the headboard. She gave 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the two of us the cold eye. 

“ ‘What is the meaning of 
this?’ she wanted to know. 

“ ‘Where’s Baby?’ I yelled at 
her. 

“ ‘Gerard,’ she says, ‘there is 
no need to shout.’ 

“Jane was a real quiet kid, but 
she said, ‘You better tell us where 
he is, Miss Kew,’ and it would of 
scared you to look at her when 
she said it. 

“So all of a sudden Miss Kew 
took off the stone face and held 
out her hands to us. ‘Children,’ 
she said, ‘I’m sorry. I really am 
sorry. But I’ve just done what is 
best. I’ve sent Baby away. He’s 
gone to live with some children 
like him. We could never make 
him really happy here. You know 
that.’ 

“Jane said, ‘He never told us he 
wasn’t happy.’ 

“Miss Kew brought out a hol- 
low kind of laugh. ‘As if he could 
talk, the poor little thing.!’ 

“ ‘You better get him back 
here,’ I said. ‘You don’t know 
•What you’re fooling with. I told 
you we wasn’t ever to break up.’ 

“She was getting mad, but she 
held on to herself. ‘I ‘11, try to ex- 
plain it to you, dear,’ she said. 
‘You and Jane here and even the 
twins are all normal, healthy 
children and you’ll grow up to 
be fine men and women. But 
poor Baby’s — different. He’s not 
going to grow very much more, 



and he’ll never walk and play like 
other children.’ 

“ ‘That doesn’t matter,’ Jane 
said. ‘You had no call to send 
him away.’ 

“And I said, ‘Yeah. You better 
bring him back, but quick.’ 
“Then she started to jump 
salty. ‘Among the many things I 
have taught you is, I am sure, not 
to dictate to your elders. Now, 
then, you run along and get 
dressed for breakfast, and we’ll 
say no more about this.’ 

“I told her, nice as I could, 
‘Miss Kew, you’re going to wish 
you brought him back right now. 
But you’re going to bring him 
back soon. Or else.’ 

“So then' she got up out of 
her bed and ran us out of the 
room.” 

1 WAS quiet a while, and Stem 
asked, “What happened?” 
“Oh,” I said, “she brought him 
back.” I laughed suddenly. “I 
guess it’s funny now, when you 
come to think of it. Nearly three 
months of us getting bossed 
around, and her ruling the roost, 
and then all of a sudden we lay 
down the law. We’d tried our 
best to be good according to her 
ideas, but, by God, that time she 
went too far. She got the treat- 
ment from the second she slam- 
med her door on us. She had a 
big china pot under her bed, and 
it rose up in the air and smashed

through her dresser mirror. Then 
one of the drawers in the dresser 
slid open and a glove come out of 
it and smacked her face. 

“She went to jump back on the 
bed and a whole section of plaster 
fell off the ceiling onto the bed. 
The water turned on in her little 
bathroom and the plug went in, 
and just about the time it began 
to overflow, all her clothes fell 
off their hooks. She went to run 
out of the room, but the door 
was stuck, and when she yanked 
on the handle it opened real 
quick and she spread out on the 
floor. The door slammed shut 
again and more plaster come 
down on her. Then we went back 
in and stood looking at her. She 
was crying. I hadn’t known till 
then that she could. 

“ ‘ Y ou going to get Baby back 
here?’ I asked her. 

“She just lay there and cried. 
After a while she looked up at 
us. It was real pathetic. We 
helped her up and got her to a 
chair. She just looked at us for 
a while, and at the mirror, and 
at the busted ceiling, and then 
she whispered, ‘What happened? 
What happened?’ 

“ ‘You took Baby away,’ I said. 
‘That’s what.’ 

“So she jumped up and said 
real low, real ■ scared, but real 
strong: ‘Something struck the 
house. An airplane. Perhaps there 
was an earthquake. We’ll talk

iik>ut Baby after breakfast." 

“I said, ‘Give her more, Janie.’ 

“A big gob of water hit her on 
the face and chest and made her 
nightgown stick to her, which 
was the kind of thing that upset 
her most. Her braids stood 
straight up in the air, more and 
more, till they dragged her stand- 
ing straight up. She opened her 
mouth to yell and the powder 
puff off the dresser rammed into 
it. She clawed it out. 

“ ‘What are you doing? What 
are you doing?’ she says, crying 
again. 

“Janie just looked at her, and 
put her hands behind her, real 
smug. ‘We haven’t done any- 
thing,’ she said. 

“And I said, ‘Not yet we 
haven’t. You going to get Baby 
back?’ 

“And she screamed at us, ‘Stop 
it! Stop it! Stop talking about 
that mongoloid idiot! It’s no good 
to anyone, not even itself! How 
could I ever make believe it’s 
mine?’ 

“I said, ‘Get rats, Janie.’ 

“There was a scuttling sound 
along the baseboard. Miss Kew 
covered her face with her hands 
and sank down on the chair. ‘Not 
rats,’ she said. ‘There are no 
rats here.’ Then something 
squeaked and she went all to 
pieces. Did you ever see anyone 
really go to pieces?” 

“Yes,” Stern said. 



“I was about as mad as I 
could get,” I said, “but that was 
almost too much for me. Still, 
she shouldn’t have sent Baby 
away. It took a couple of hours 
for her to get straightened out 
enough- so she could use the 
phone, but we had Baby back 
before lunch time.” I laughed. 
“What’s funny?” 

“She never seemed able to 
rightly remember what had hap- 
pened to her. About three weeks 
later I heard her talking to Mir- 
iam about it. She said it was the 
house settling suddenly. She said 
it was a good thing she’d sent 
Baby out for that medical check- 
up — the poor little thing might 
have been hurt. She really be- 
lieved it, I think.” 

“She probably did. That’s fair- 
ly common. We don’t believe 
anything we don’t want to be- 
lieve.” 

“How much of this do you be- 
lieve?” I asked him suddenly. 

“I told you before — it doesn’t 
matter. I don’t want to believe 
or disbelieve it.” 

“You haven’t asked me how 
much of it I believe.” 

“I don’t have to. You’ll make 
up your own mind about that.’* 
“Are you a good psychothera- 
pist?” 

“I think so,” he said! “Whom 
did you kill?” 

The question caught me abso- 
lutely off guard. “Miss Kew,” I

said. Then I started to cuss and, 
swear. “I didn’t mean to tell you 
that.” 

“Don’t worry about it,” he 
said. “What did you do it for?” 

“That’s' what I came here to 
find out.” 

“You must have really hated 
her.” 

I started to cry. Fifteen years 
old and crying like that! 

TTE gave me time to get it all 
out. The first part of it came 
out in noises, grunts and squeaks 
that hurt my throat. Much more 
than you’d think came out when 
my nose started to run. And 
finally — words. 

“Do you know where I came 
from? The earliest thing I can 
remember is a punch in the 
: 4nouth. I can still see it coming, 
a fist as big as my head. Because 
I was crying. I been afraid to 
cry ever since. I was crying be- 
cause I was hungry. Cold, may- 
be. Both. After that, big dormi- 
tories, and whoever could steal 
the most got the most. Get the 
hell kicked out of you if you’re 
pad, get a big reward if you’re 
good. Big reward: they let you 
alone. Try to live like that. Try 
fo live so the biggest, most won- 
derful thing in the whole damn 
World is just to have ’em let you 
jltlone! 

- . “So a spell with Lone and the 
kids. Something wonderful : you 



belong. It never happened before. 
Two yellow bulbs and a fireplace 
and they light up the world. It’s 
all there is and all there ever has 
to be. 

“Then the big change : clean 
clothes, cooked food, five hours 
a day school; Columbus and 
King Arthur and a 1925 book on 
Civics that explains about septic 
tanks. Over it all a great big 
square -cut lump of ice, and you 
watch it melting and the corners 
curve, and you know it’s because 
of you, Miss Kew . hell, she 
had too much control over her- 
self ever to slobber over us, but 
it was there, that feeling. Lone 
took care of us because it was 
part of the way he lived. Miss 
Kew took care of us, and none 
of it was the way she lived. It 
was something she wanted to do. 

“She had a weird idea of 
‘right’ and a wrong idea of 
‘wrong,’ but she stuck to them, 
tried to make her ideas do us 
good. When she couldn’t under- 
stand, she figured it was her own 
failure . and there was an al- 
mighty lot she didn’t understand 
and never could. What went 
right was our success. What went 
wrong was her mistake. That last 
year, that was . oh, good.” 

“So?” 

“So I killed her. Listen,” I 
said. I felt I had to talk fast. I 
wasn’t short of time, but I had 
to get rid \>f it. “I’ll tell you all

I know about it. The one day be- 
fore I killed her. I woke up in the 
morning and the sheets crackly 
clean under me, the sunlight 
coming in through white curtains 
and bright red-and-blue drapes. 
There’s a closet full of my clothes 
— >mine, you see; I never had any- 
thing '"that was really mine before 
— and downstairs Miriam clink- 
ing around with breakfast and 
the twins laughing. Laughing 
with her, mind you, not just with 
each other like they always did 
before. 

“In the next room, Janie mov- 
ing around, singing, and when I 
see her, I know her face will 
shine inside and out. I get up. 
There’s hot hot water and the 
toothpaste bites my tongue. The 
clothes fit me and I go down- 
stairs and they’re all there and 
I’m glad to see them and they’re 
glad to see me, and we no sooner 
get set around the table when 
Miss Kew comes down and ev- 
eryone calls out to her at once. 

“And the morning goes by like 
that, school with a recess, there 
in the big long living room. The 
twins with the ends of their 
tongues stuck out, drawing the 
alphabet instead of writing it, 
and then Jane, when it’s time, 
painting a picture, a real picture 
of a cow with trees and a yellow 
fence that goes off into the dis- 
tance. Here I am lost between the 
two parts of a quadratic equa- 



tion, and Miss Kew bending close 
to help me, and I smell the sachet 
she has on her clothes. I hold up 
my head to smell it better, and 
far away I hear the .shuffle and 
klunk of filled pots going on the 
stove. back in the kitchen., 

“And the afternoon goes by 
like that, more school and some 
study and boiling out into the 
yard, laughing. The twins chas- 
ing each other,, running on their 
two feet to get where they want 
to go; Jane dappling the leaves 
in her picture, trying to get it 
just the way Miss Kew says it 
ought* to be. And Baby, he’s got 
a big play-pen. He don’t move 
around much any more, he just 
watches and dribbles some, and 
gets packed full of food and kept 
as clean as a new sheet of tinfoil. 

“And supper, and the evening, 
and Miss Kew reading -to us, 
changing her voice every time 
someone else talks in the story, 
reading fast and whispery when 
it embarrasses her, but reading 
every word all the same. 

“And I had to go and kill her. 
And that’s all.” 

“’^LTOU haven’t said why,” Stern 
said. 

“What are you — stupid?” I 

yelled. 

«■ Stern didn’t say anything. I 
turned on my belly on the couch 
and propped up my chin in my 
hands and looked at him. You 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



never could tell what was going 
on with him, but I got the idea 
that he was puzzled. 

“I said why,” I told him. 

“Not to me.” 

I suddenly understood that I 
was asking too much of hing. I 
said slowly, “We all woke up at 
the same time. We all did what 
somebody else wanted. We lived 
through a day someone else’s 
way, thinking someone else’s 
thoughts, saying other people’s 
words. Jane painted someone 
else’s pictures, Baby didn’t talk 
to anyone, and we were all happy 
with it. Now do you see?” 

“Not yet.” 

“God!” I said. I thought for a 
while. “We didn’t blesh.” 

“Blesh? Oh. But you didn’t 
after Lone died, either.” 

“That was different. That was 
like a car running out of gas, but 
the car’s there — there’s nothing 
wrong with it. It’s just waiting. 
But after Miss Kew got done 
with us, the car was taken all to 
pieces, see?” 

It was his turn to think a 
while. Finally he said, “The mind 
makes us do funny things. Some 
of them seem completely reason- 
less, wrong, insane. But the cor- 
nerstone of the work we’re doing 
it this: there’s a chain of solid, 
unassailable logic in the things 
We do. Dig deep enough and you 
find cause and effect as clearly 
if*, this field £fs you do in any 



other. I said logic, mind; I didn’t 
say ‘correctness,’ or ‘rightness’ or 
‘justice’ or anything of the sort. 
Logic and truth are two very 
different things, but they often 
look the same to the mind that’* 
performing the logic. 

“When that 'mind is sub- 
merged, working at cross-pur ? 
poses with the surface mind, then 
you’re all confused. Now in your 
case, I can see the thing you’re 
pointing at — that in order to pre- 
serve or to rebuild that peculiar 
bond between you kids, you had 
to get rid of Miss Kew. But I 
don’t see the logic. I don’t see 
that regaining that ‘Meshing’ was 
worth destroying this new-found 
security which you admit was 
enjoyable.” 

I said, desperately, “Maybe it 
wasn’t worth destroying it.” 

Stern leaned forward and 
pointed his pipe at me. “It was 
because it made you do what you 
did. After the fact, maybe things 
look different. But, when you 
were moved to do it, the impor- 
tant thing was to destroy Miss 
Kew and regain this thing you'd 
had before. I don’t see why and 
neither do you.” 

“How are we going to find 
out?” 

“Well, let’s get right to the 
most unpleasant part, if you’re 
up to it.” 

I lay down. “I’m ready.” 

“All right. Tell me everything

that happened just before you 
killed her.” 

1 FUMBLED through that last 
day, trying to taste the food, 
hear the voices. A thing came 
and went and came again : it was 
the crisp feeling of the sheets. I 
thrust it away because it was at 
the beginning of that day, but it 
came back again, and I realized 
it was at the end, instead. 

I said, “What I just told you, 
all that about the children doing 
things other people's way instead 
of their own, and Baby not talk- 
ing, and everyone happy about it, 
and finally that I had to kill Miss 
Kew. It took a long time to get 
to that, and a long time to start 
doing it. I guess I lay in bed and 
thought for four hours before I 
got up again. It was dark and 
quiet. I went - out of the room 
and down the hall and into Miss 
Kew’s bedroom and killed her.” 
“How?” 

“That’s all there is!” I shouted, 
as loud as I could. Then I quiet- 
ed down. “It was awful dark . 
it still is. I don’t know. I don’t 
want to know. She did love us. 
I know she did. But I had to kill 
her.” 

“All right, all right,” Stern 
said. “I guess there’s no need to 
get too gruesome about this. 
You’re—” 

“What?” 

“You’re quite strong for your 



age, aren’t you, Gerard?” : 
“I guess so. Strong enough, 
anyway.” 

“Yes,” he said. 

“I still don’t see that logic you 
were talking about.’’ I began to 
hammer on the couch with my 
fist, "hard, once for each word: 
“Why — did — I — have — to 
— go — and — do — that?” 

“Cut that out,” he said. “You’ll 
hurt yourself.” 

“I ought to get hurt,” I said. 
“Ah?” said Stern. 

I got up and went to the desk 
and got some water. “What am I 
going to do?” 

“Tell me what you did after 
you killed her, right up until the 
time you came here.” 

“Not much,” I said. “It was 
only last night. I went back to 
my room, sort of numb. I put 
all my clothes on except my 
shoes. I carried them. I went out. 
Walked a long time, trying to 
think, went to the post office 
when it opened. Miss Kew used 
to let me go for the mail some- 
times. Found this check waiting 
for me for the contest. Cashed it 
at the bank, opened an account, 
took eleven hundred bucks. Got 
the idea of getting some help 
from a psychiatrist, spent most 
of the day looking for one, came 
here. That’s all.” 

“Didn’t you have any trouble 
cashing the check?” 

“I never have any trouble

making people do what I want 
them to do.” 

He gave a surprised grunt. 

“I know what you’re thinking 
—I couldn’t make Miss Kew do 
what I wanted.” 

“That’s part of it,” he ad- 
mitted. 

“If I had of done that,” I told 
him, “she wouldn’t of been Miss 
Kew any more. Now the banker 
—all I made him do was be a 
banker.” 



I LOOKED at him and sudden- 
ly realized why he fooled 
With that pipe all the time. It 
Was so he could look down at it 
•nd you wouldn’t be able to see 
bis eyes. 

“You killed her,” he said — and 
1 knew he was changing the sub- 
ject — “and destroyed something 
■that was valuable to you. It must 
futve been less valuable to you 
!»an the chance to rebuild this 
iiing you used to have with the 
ther kids. And you’re not sure 
the value of that.” He looked 
“Does that describe your 
»in trouble?” 
li “Just about.” 

“You know the single thing 
lat makes people kill?” When 
didn’t answer, he said, “Sur- 
ival. To save the self or some- 
bang which identifies with the 
Ilf. And in this case that doesn’t 
aly, because your setup with 
Miss Kew had far more survival 



value for you, singly and as a 
group, than the other.” 

‘ So maybe I just' didn’t have 
a good enough reason to kill her.” 
“You had, because you did it. 
We just haven’t located it yet. 
I mean we have the reason, but 
we don’t know why it was im- 
portant enough. The answer is 
somewhere in you.” 

“Where?” 

He got up and walked some. 
“We have a pretty consecutive 
life -story here. There’s fantasy 
mixed with the fact, of course, 
and there are areas in which we 
have no detailed information, but 
we have a beginning and a mid- 
dle and an end. Now, I can’t say 
for sure, but the answer may be 
in that bridge you refused to 
cross a while back. Remember?” 
I remembered, all right. I said, 
“Why that? Why can’t we try 
something else?” 

He quietly pointed out, “Be- 
cause you just said it. Why are 
you shying away from it?” 
“Don’t go making big ones out 
of little ones,” I said. Sometimes 
the guy annoyed me. “That both- 
ers me. I don’t know why, but it 
does.” 

“Something’s lying hidden in 
there, and you’re bothering it so 
it’s fighting back. Anything that 
fights to stay concealed is very 
possibly the thing we’re after. 
Your trouble is concealed, isn’t 
it?”

“Well, yes,” I said, and I felt 
that sickness and faintness again, 
and again I pushed it away. Sud- 
denly I wasn’t going to be stop- 
ped any more. “Let’s go get it.” 

2 lay down. 

He let me watch the ceiling and 
listen to silence for a while, and 
then he said, “You’re in the li- 
brary. You’ve just met Miss Kew. 
She’s talking to you; you’re tell- 
ing her about the children.” 

I lay very still. Nothing hap- 
pened. Yes, it did; I got tense 
inside, all over, from the bones 
out. more and more. When it got 
as bad as it could, still nothing 
happened. 

I heard him get up and cross 
the room to the desk. He fumbled 
there for a while: things clicked 
and hummed. Suddenly I heard 
my own voice: 

“Well, there's Jane, she’s elev- 
en like me. And Bonnie and 
Beanie are eight, they’re twins, 
and Baby. Baby is three.” 

And the sound of my own 
ter earn — 

And nothingness. 

S PUTTERING up out of the 
darkness, I came flailing out 
with my fists. Strong hands 
caught my wrists. -They didn’t 
check my arms; they just grab-' 
bed and rode. I opened my eyes. 
I was soaking wet. The thermos 
lay on its side on the rug. Stern 
was crouched beside me, holding 



my wrists. I quit struggling. 

“What happened?” 

He let me go and stood back 
watchfully. “Lord,” he said, 
“what a charge!” 

I held my head and moaned. 

He threw me a hand-towel and 
I used it. “What hit me?” 

“I’ve had you on tape the i 
whole time,” he explained. “When i 
you wouldn’t get into that recol- ; 
lection, I tried to nudge you into i 
it by using your own voice as 
you recounted it before. It works 
wonders sometimes.” 

“It worked wonders this time,” 

I growled. “I think I blew a fuse.” 
“In effect, you did. You were 
on the trembling verge of going 
into the thing you don’t want to 
remember, and you let yourself j 
go unconscious rather than do it.” j 
“What are you so pleased j 
about?” 

“Last-ditch defense,” he said 
tersely. “We’ve got it now. Just 
one more try.” 

“Now hold on. The last-ditch 
defense is that I drop dead.” 

“You won’t. You’ve contained 
this episode in your subconscious 
mind for a long time and it hasn’t 
hurt you.” 

“Hasn’t it?” 

“Not in terms of killing you.” 
“How do you know it won’t 
when we drag it out?” 

“You’ll see.” 

I looked up at him sideways. 
Somehow he struck me as know- 



i 44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing what he was doing, 

“You know a lot more about 
yourself now than you did at the 
thne,” he explained softly. “You 
Can apply insight. You can evalu- 
ate it as it comes up. Maybe not 
Completely, but enough to pro- 
tect yourself. Don’t worry. Trust 
me. I can stop it if it gets too 
bad. Now just relax. Look at the 
Ceiling. Be aware of your toes. 
Don’t look at your toes. Look 
■traight up. Your toes, your big 
toes. Don’t move your toes, but 
feel them. Count outward from 
grour big toes, one count for each 

t feoc. One, two, three. Feel that 
third toe. Feel the toe, feel it, 
feel it go limp, go limp, go limp, 
^he toe next to it on both sides 
its limp. So limp because your 
■es are limp, all of your toes are 
limp — ” 

“What are you doing?’’ I 
shouted at him. 

He said in the same silky voice, 
*You trust me and so do your 
■toes trust me. They’re all limp 
because you trust me. You — ” 
“You’re trying to hypnotize 
me. I’m not going to let you do 
that.’’ 

“You’re going to hypnotize 
yourself. You do everything your- 
self. I just point the way. I point 
your toes to the path. Just point 
your toes. No one can make you 
go anywhere you don’t want to 
go, but you want to go where 
your toes are pointed where your 



toes are limp where your ..." 

On and on and on. And where 
was the dangling gold ornament, 
the light in the eyes, the mystic 
passes? He wasn’t even sitting 
where I could see him. Where 
was the talk about how sleepy I 
was supposed to be? Well, he 
knew I wasn’t sleepy and didn’t 
want to be sleepy. I just wanted 
to be toes. I just wanted to be 
limp, just a limp toe. No brains 
in a toe, a toe to go, go, go eleven 
times, eleven, I’m eleven ... 

I split in two, and it was all 
right, the part that watched the 
part that went back to the li- 
brary, and Miss Kew leaning to- 
ward me, but not too near, me 
with the newspaper crackling 
under me on the library chair, 
me with one shoe off and my limp 
toes dangling . and I felt a 
mild surprise at this. For this was 
hypndsis, but I was quite con- 
scious? quite altogether there on 
the couch with Stern droning 
away at me, quite able to roll 
over and sit up and talk to him 
and walk out if I wanted to, but 
I just didn’t want to. Oh, if this 
was what hypnosis was like, I 
was all for it. I’d work at this. 
This was all right. 

There on the table I’m able to 
see that the gold will unfold on 
the leather, and whether I’m able 
to stay by the table with you, 
with Miss Kew, with Miss 
Kew ...

fc . and Bonnie and Beanie 
are eight, they’re twins, and 
Baby. Baby is three.” 

"Baby is three,” she said. 
There was a pressure, a stretch- 
ing apart, and a ... a breakage. 
And with a tearing agony and a 
burst of triumph that drowned 
the pain, it was done. 

And this is what was inside. 
All«io one flash, but all this. 

ABY is three? My baby 
would be three if there were 
a baby, which there never was. 

Lone, I’m open to you. Open, 
is this open enough? 

His irises like wheels. I’m sure 
they spin, but I never catch them 
at it. The probe that passes in- 
visibly from his brain, through 
his eyes, into mine. Does he 
know what it means to me? Does 
he care? He doesn’t care, he 
doesn’t know; he empties me and 
I fill as he directs me to; he 
drinks and waits and drinks again 
and never looks at the cup. 

•When I saw him first, I was 
dancing in the wind, in the wood, 
in the wild, and I spun about and 
he stood there in the leafy shad- 
ows, watching me. I hated him 
for it. It was not my wood, not 
my gold-spangled fern-tangled 
glen. But it was my dancing that 
he took, freezing it forever by 
being there.' I hated him for it, 
hated the way he looked, the way 
he stood, ankle-deep in the kind 



wet ferns, looking like a tree with 
roots for feet and clothes the 
color of earth. As I stopped he 
moved, and then he was just a 
man, a great ape-shouldered, 
dirty animal of a man, and all 
my hate was fear suddenly and I 
was just as frozen. 

He knew what he had done 
and he didn’t care. Dancing . » 
never to dance again, because 
never would I know the woods 
were free of eyes, free of tall, 
uncaring, dirty animal men. Sum- 
mer days with the clothes chok- 
ing me, winter nights with the 
precious decencies round and 
about me like a shroud, and 
never to dance again, never to 
remember dancing without re- 
membering the shock of knowing 
he had seen me. How I hated 
him! Oh, how I hated him! 

To dance alone where no one 
knew, that was the single thing 
I hid to myself when I was 
known as Miss Kew, that Vic- 
torian, older than her years, later 
than her time; correct and 
starched, lace and linen and 
lonely. Now indeed I would be 
all they said, through and 
through, forever and ever, be- 
cause he had robbed me of the 
one thing I dared to keep secret. 

He came out 'into the sun and 
walked to me, holding his great 
head a little on one side. I stood 
where I was, frozen inwardly and 
outwardly and altogether by the 




48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tore of anger and the layer of 
fear. My arm was still out, my 
Waist still bent from my dance, 
and when he stopped, I breathed 
again because by then I had to. 
He said, "You read books?” 

1 couldn’t bear to have him 
near me, but I couldn’t move. He 
put out his hard hand and touch- 
ed my jaw, turned my head up 
until I had to look into his face. 
I cringed away from him, but 
my face would not leave his 
hand, though he was not holding 
it, just lifting it. "You got to 
read some books for me. 1 got 
no time to find them.” 

I asked him, "Who are you?” 
"Lone,” he said. “You going to 
read books for me?” 

"No. Let me go, let me go!” 

He laughed at me. He wasn’t 
holding me. 

"What books?” I cried. 

E thumped my face, not very 
hard. It made me look up a 
bit more. He dropped his hand 
away. His eyes, the irises were 
going to spin . , 

"Open Up in there,” he said. 
-"Open way up and let me see.” 
There were books in my head, 
fend he was looking at the titles 
* . he was not looking at the 
titles, for he couldn’t read. He 
was looking at what I knew of 
the books. I suddenly felt ter- 
ribly useless, because I had only 
a fraction of what he wanted. 



"What’s that?” he barked. 

I knew what he meant. He’d 
gotten it from inside my head. I 
didn’t know it was in there, even, 
but he found it. 

"Telekinesis,” I said. 

“How is it done?” 

“Nobody knows if it can be 
done. Moving physical objects 
with the mind!” 

“It can be done,” he said. “This 
one?” 

"Teleportation. That’s the 
same thing — well, almost. Mov- 
ing your own body with mind 
power.” 

"Yeah, yeah, I see it,” he said 
gruffly. 

"Molecular interpenetration. 
Telepathy and clairvoyance. I 
don’t know anything about them. 
I think they’re silly.” 

"Read about ’em. It don’t mat- 
ter if you understand or not. 
What’s this?” 

It was there in my brain, on 
my lips. “Gestalt.” 

“What’s that?” 

"Group. Like a cure for a lot 
of diseases with one kind of 
treatment. Like a lot of thoughts 
expressed in one phrase. The 
whole is greater than the sum of 
the parts.” 

"Read about that, too. Read a 
whole lot about that. That’s the 
most you got to read about. 
That’s important.” 

He turned away, and when his 
eyes came away from mine it was 




BABY IS THREE

like something- breaking, so that 
I staggered and fell to one -knee. 
He went off into the woods with- 
out looking back. I got my things 
and ran home. There was anger, 
and it struck me like a storm. 
There was fear, and it struck me 
like a wind. I knew I would read 
the books, I knew I would come 
back, I knew I would never 
dance again. 

So I read the books and I came 
back. Sometimes it was every day 
for three or four days, and some- 
times, because I couldn’t find a 
certain book, I might not come 
back for ten. He was always there 
in the little glen, waiting, stand- 
ing in the shadows, and he took 
what he wanted of the books and 
nothing of me. He never men- 
tioned the next meeting. If he 
came there every day to wait for 
me, or if he only came when I 
did, I have no way of knowing. 

He made me read books that 
contained nothing for me, books 
on evolution, on social and cul- 
tural organization, on mythology, 
and ever so much on symbiosis. 
What I had with him were not 
conversations; sometimes noth- 
ing audible would pass between 
us but his grunt of surprise or 
small, short hum of interest. 

He tore the books out of me the 
Way he would tear berries from 
a bush, all at once; he smelled of 
sweat and earth and the green 
Juices his heavy body crushed

when he moved through the 
wood. 

If he learned anything from 
the books, it made no difference 
in him. 

npHERE came a day when he 
sat by me and puzzled some- 
thing out. 

He said, “What book has some- 
thing like this?” Then he waited 
for a long time, thinking. “The 
way a termite can’t digest wood, 
you know, and microbes in the 
termite’s belly can, and what the 
termite eats is what the microbe 
leaves behind. What’s that?” 

“Symbiosis,” I remembered. I 
remembered the words. Lone tore 
the content from words and threw 
the words away. “Two kinds of 
life depending upon one another 
for existence.” 

“Yeah. Well, is there a book 
about four-five kinds doing 
that?” 

“I don’t know.” 

Then he asked, “What about 
this? You got a radio station, you 
got four-five receivers, each re- 
ceiver is fixed up to make some- 
thing different happen, like one 
digs and one flies and one makes 
noise, but each one takes orders 
from the one place. And each one 
has its own power and its own 
thing to do, but they are all apart. 
Now: is there life like that, in- 
stead of radio?” 

“Where each organism is a part

^the tSiole, but separated?..! 
’t think so . unless you 
an social organizations, like a 
team, or perhaps a gang of men 
Working, all taking orders from 
the same boss.” 

“No,” he said immediately, 

; “not like that. Like one single 
animal.” He made a gesture with 
his cupped hand which I under- 
stood.* 

I asked, “You mean a gestalt 
jilife-form? It’s fantastic.” 

“No book has about that, 
huh?” 

“None I ever heard of.” 

“I got to know about that,” he 
|said heavily. “There is such a 
-thing. I want to know if it ever 
happened before.” 

I can’t see how.- anything of 
I’the sort could exist.” 

“It does. A part that fetches, 
a part that figures, a part that 
finds out, and a part that talks.” 
“Talks? Only humans talk.” 
“I know,” he said, and got up 
find went away. 

..<• I looked and looked for such a 
.book, but found nothing remote- 
By like it. I came back and told 
him so. He was still a very long 
time, looking off to the blue-on- 
blue line of the hilly horizon. 
Then he drove those about-to- 
i spin irises at me and searched. 
i- “You learn, but you don’t 
think,” he said, and looked again 
eat the hills. 

“This all happens with hu- 



* 



*B Y IS THREE 



mans,” he said eventually. “It 
happens piece by piece right 
under folk’s noses, and they don’t 
see it. You got mind-readers. You 
got people can move things with 
their mind. You got people can 
move themselves with their mind. 
You got people can figure any- 
thing out if you just think to ask 
them. What you ain’t got is the 
one kind of person who can pull 
’em all together, like a brain pulls 
together the parts that press and 
pull and feel heat and walk and 
think and all the other things. 

"I’m one,” he finished sudden- 
ly. Then he sat still for so long, 
I thought he had forgotten me. 

“Lone,” I said, “what do you 
do here in the woods?” 

“I wait,” he said. “I ain’t fin- 
ished yet.” He looked at my eyes 
and snorted in irritation. “I don’t 
mean ‘finished’ like you’re think- 
ing. I mean I ain’t— completed 
yet. You know about a worm 
when it’s cut, growin’ whole 
again? Well, forget about the cub 
Suppose it just grew that way, 
for the first time, see? I’m getting 
parts. I ain’t finished. I want a 
book about that kind of animal 
that is me when I’m finished.” 

"I don’t know of such a book. 
Can you tell me more? Maybe 
if you could, I’d think of the 
right book or a place to find it.” 
He broke a stick between his 
huge. hands, put the two pieces 
side by side and broke them to- 



9T 



wi&i one strong twist. 

“All I know is I got to do what 
I’m doing like a bird’s got to nest 
when it’s time/ And I know that 
When I’m done I won’t be any- 
thing to brag about. Ill be like a 
body stronger and faster than 
anything there ever was, without 
the right kind of head on it. But 
maybe that’s because I’m one of 
the first. That picture you had, 
the caveman . 

“Neanderthal.” 

“Yeah. Come to think of it, he 
was no great shakes. An early try 
at something new. That’s what 
I’m going to be. But maybe the 
right kind of head’ll come along 
after I’m all organized. Then it’ll 
be something.” 

He grunted with satisfaction 
and went' away. 

X TRIED, for days I tried, but 
I couldn’t find what he want- 
ed. I found' a magazine which 
stated that the next important 
evolutionary step in man would 
be a psychic rather than a physi- 
' cal direction, but it said nothing 
about a — shall I call it a gestalt 
organism? There was something 
about slime molds, but they seem 
to be more a hive activity of 
amoebae than even a symbiosis. 

To my own unscientific, per- 
sonally uninterested mind, there 
was nothing like what he wanted 
except possibly a band marching 
together, everyone playing differ- 



ent kinds of instruments with dif- 
ferent techniques and different 
notes, to make a single thing 
move along together. But he 
hadn’t meant anything like that. 

So I went back to him in the 
cool of an early fall evening, and 
he took what little I had in my 
eyes, and turned from me angrily 
with a gross word I shall not per- 
mit myself to remember. • 

“You can’t find it,” he told me. 
“Don’t come back.” 

He got up and went to a tatter- 
ed birch and leaned against it, 
looking out and down into the 
wind -tossed crackling shadows. I 
think he had forgotten me al- 
ready. I know he leaped like a 
frightened animal when I spoke 
to him from so near. He must 
have been completely immersed 
in whatever strange thoughts he 
was having, for I’m sure he 
didn’t hear me coming. 

I said “Lone, don’t blame me 
for not finding it. I tried.” 

He controlled his startlement 
and brought those eyes down to 
me. “Blame? Who’s blamin’ any- 
body?” 

“I failed you,” I tpld him, “and 
you’re angry.” 

He looked at me so long I be- 
came uncomfortable. 

“I don’t know what you’re 
talkin’ about,” he said. 

I wouldn’t let him turn away 
from me. He would have. He 
would have left me forever with

and shook him, it was like trying 
to shake the front of my house. 
\ “You can know!” I screamed at 
'f him. “You know what I read. 

- You must know what I think!” 
He shook his head. 

“I’m a person, a woman,” I 
raved at him. “You’ve used me 
and used me and you’ve given 
me nothing. You’ve made me 
break a lifetime of habits — read- 
ing until all hours, coming to you 
in the rain and on Sunday — you 
don’t talk to me, you don’t look

me that I couldn’t break. And 
when you’re finished, you say, 
‘Don’t come back.’ ” 

“Do I have to give something 
back because I took something?” 
“People do.” 

He gave that short, interested 
hum. “What do you want me to 
give you? I ain’t got anything.” 
I moved away from him. I 
felt ... I don’t know what I felt. 
After a time I said, “I don’t 
know.” 

He shrugged and turned. I 
fairly leaped at him, dragging 
-him back. “I want you to — ”

“Well, damn it, what?” 

I couldn’t look at him; I could 
hardly speak. “I don’t know. 
There’s something, but I don’t 
know what it is. It’s something 
that — I couldn’t say if I knew 
it.” When he began to shake hhr 
head, I took his arms again, 
“You’ve read the books out of 
me; can’t you read the . the 
me out of me?” , 

“I ain’t never tried.” He held 
my face up, and stepped close. 
“Here,” he said. 

H IS eyes projected their 
strange probe at me and’ I 
screamed. I tried to twist away. 
I hadn’t wanted this, I' was sure 
I hadn’t. I struggled terribly. I 
think he lifted me right off the 
ground with his big hands. He 
held me until he was finished, 
and then let me drop. I huddled 
to the ground, sobbing. He sat 
down beside me. He didn’t try 
to touch me. He didn’t tty to go 
away. I quieted at last and 
crouched there, waiting. 

He said, “I ain’t going to do 
much of that no more.” 

I sat up and tucked my skirt 
close around me and laid my 
cheek on my updraw?n knees so I 
could see his face. “What Hap- 
pened?” 

He cursed. “Damn mishmash 
inside you. Thirty-three years old 
— what you want to live like that 
for?”

“I live very comfortably,” I 
said with some pique. 

“Yeah,” he said. “All by your- 
self for ten years now ’cept for 
someone to do your work. No- 
body else.” 

“Men are animals, and wo- 
men ...” 

“You really hate women. They 
all know something you don’t.” 

“I don’t want to know. I’m 
quite happy the way I am. 

“Hell you are.” 

I said nothing to that. I despise 
that kind of language. 

“Two things you want from 
me. Neither makes no sense.” He 
looked at me with the first real 
expression I have ever seen in his 
face: a profound wonderment. 

“You want to know all about me, 
where I came from, how I got to 
be what I am.” 

“Yes, I do want that. What’s 
the other thing I want that you 
know and I don’t?” 

■ “I was born some place' and 
growed like a weed somehow,” 
he said, 'ignoring me. “Folks who 
didn’t give even enough of a 
damn to try the orphanage rou- 
tine. I lived with some other folks 
fpr a while, tried school, didn’t 
like it. Too small a town for them 
special schools for my kind, re- 
tarded, y’know. So I just ran 
loose, sort of in training, to be the 
village idiot. I’da made it if I’d 
stayed there, but I took to the 
woods instead.” 



“Why?” 

He wondered why, and finally 
said, “I guess because the way 
people lived didn’t make no sense 
to me. I saw enough up and down, 
back and forth, to know that they 
live a lot of different ways, but 
none of ’em was for me. Out here 
I can grow like I want.” 

“How is that?” I asked over 
one of those vast distances that 
built and receded between him 
and me so constantly. 

“What I wanted to get from 
your books.” 

“You never told me.” 

TT'OR the second time he said, 
“You learn, but 1 ' you don’t 
think. There’s a kind of-^well, 
person. It’s all made of separate 
parts, but it’s all one person. It 
has like hands, it has like legs, 
it has like a talking mouth, and 
it has like a brain. That’s me, a 
brain for that person. Damn 
feeble, too. but the best I know 
of.”, 

“You’re mad,” 

“No, I ain’t,” he said, unoffend- 
ed and completely certain. “I 
already got the part that’s like 
hands. I can move ’em anywhere 
and they do what I want, though 
they’re too young yet to do much 
good. I got the part, that talks, 
that one’s real good.” 

“I don’t think you talk very 
well at all,” I said. I cannot stand 
incorrect English.

My own head was swimming. 
"What made you start doing 
this?” 

He considered me gravely. 
^“What made you start growing

[fact' “You don’t figure a thing

ful that you’ll be glad to do it. 
But you’ll forget, all right, every- 
thing but a sort of . feeling. 
And my name, maybe.” 

I don’t know what moved me 
to ask him, but I did, forlornly. 
“And no one will ever know about 
you and me?” 

“Can’t,” he said. “Unless . 
well, unless it was the head of 
the animal, like me, or a better 
one.” He heaved himself up. 

“Oh, wait, wait!” I cried. He 
mustn’t go yet, he mustn’t. He 
was a tall, dirty beast of a man, 
yet he had enthralled me in some 
dreadful way. “You haven’t given 
me the other ... whatever it 
was.” 

“Oh,” he said. “Yeah, that.” 

He moved like a flash. There 
was a pressure, a stretching apart, 
and a ... A breakage. And with 
a tearing agony and a burst of 
triumph that drowned the pain, 
it was done. 

1 CAME up out of it, through 
two distinct levels : 

I am eleven, breathless from 
shock from a transferred agony 
of that incredible entrance into 
the ego of another. And: 

I am fifteen, lying on the couch 
while Stern drones on, “. quiet- 
ly, quietly limp, your ankles and 
kgs as limp as your toes, your 
belly goes soft, the back of your 
neck is as limp as your belly, it’s 
quiet and easy and all gone soft 



and limper than limp , . ” 
I sat up and swung my legs to 
the floor. “Okay,” I said. 

Stern looked a little annoyed. 
“This is going to work,” he said, 
“but it can only work if you co- 
operate. Just lie — ” 

“It did work,” I said. 

• “What?” 

“The whole thing. A to Z.” I 
snapped my fingers. “Like that.” 
He looked at me piercingly. 
“What do you mean?” 

“It was right there, where you 
said. In the library. When I was 
eleven. When she said, ‘Baby is 
three.’ It knocked loose some- 
thing that had been boiling 
around in her for three years, and 
it all came blasting out. I got it, 
full force; just a kid, no warning, 
no defenses. It had such a — a 
pain in it, like I never knew could 
be.” 

“Go on,” said Stern. 

“That’s really all. I mean that’s 
not what was in it; it’s what it 
did to me. What it was, a sort of 
hunk of her own self. A whole lot 
of things that happened over 
about four months, every bit of 
it. She knew Lone.” 

“You mean a whole series of 
episodes?” 

“That’s it.” 

“You gpt a series all at once? 
In a split second?” 

“That’s right. Look, for that 
split second I was her, don’t you 
see? I was her, everything she’d 

56 



ever done, everything she’d ever 
thought and heard and felt. Ev- 
erything, everything, all in the 
right order if I wanted to bring 
it out like that. Any part of it 
if I wanted it by itself. If I’m 
going to tell you about what I 
had for lunch, do I have to tell 
you everything else I’ve ever 
done since I was born? No. I tell 
you I was her, and then and for- 
ever after I can remember any- 
thing she could remember up to 
that point. In just that one 
flash.” 

“A gestalt he murmured. 

“Aha!” I said, and thought 
about that. I thought about a 
whole lot of things. I put them 
aside for a moment and said, 
“Why didn’t I. know all this be- 
fore?” 

“You had a powerful block 
against recalling it.” 

1 GOT up excitedly. “I don’t 
see why. I don’t see that at 
all.” 

“Just natural revulsion,” he 
guessed. “How about this? You 
had a distaste for assuming a fe- 
male ego, even for a second.” 
“You told me yourself, right 
at the beginning, that I didn’t 
have that kind of a problem.” 
“Well, how does this sound to 
you? You say you felt pain in 
that episode. So — you wouldn’t 
go back into it for fear of re- 
experiencing the pain.”

not believing or disbelieving, just 
taking it all in. I had to tell him, 
and I suddenly realized that I 
didn’t have enough words. I 
knew the things, but not the 
names for them. 

Lone took the meanings . and 
threw the words away. 

Further back: “You read 

books. Read books for me.” 
The look of his eyes. That — 
“opening up” thing.

I went over to Stem. He look- 
ed up at me. I bent close. First 
he was startled, then he controll- 
ed it, then he came even closer to 
me. 

“My God,” he murmured. “I 
didn’t look at those eyes before. 
I could have sworn those irises 
spun like wheels . 

S TERN read books. He’d read 
more books than I ever imag- 
ined had been written. I slipped 
in there, looking for what I 
wanted. 

I can’t say exactly what it was 
like. It was like walking in a tun- 
nel, and in this tunnel, all over 
the roof and walls, wooden arms 
stuck out at you, like the thing 
at the carnival, the merry-go- 
round, the thing you snatch the 
brass rings from. There’s a brass 
ring on the end of each of these 
arms, and you can take any one 
of them you want to. 

Now imagine you make up 
your mind which rings you want, 
and the arms hold only those. 
Now. picture yourself with a thou - 
sand hands to grab the rings off 
with. Now just suppose the tun- 
nel is a zillion miles long, and 
you can go from one end of it to 
the other, grabbing rings, in just 
the time it takes you to blink 
once. Well, it was like that, only 
easier. 

It was easier for me to do than 
it had been for Lone.

TRAIGHTENING up, I got 
away from Stern. He looked 
sick and frightened. 

“It’s all right,” I said. 

“What did you do to me?” 

“I needed some words. Come 
on, come on. Get professional.” 
I had to admire him. He put 
his pipe in his pocket and gouged 
the tips of his fingers hard against 
his forehead and cheeks. Then 
he sat up and he was okay again. 

“I know,” 1 said. “That’s how 
Miss Kew felt when Lone did it 
to her.” 

“What are you?” 

“I’ll tell you. I’m the central 
ganglion of a complex organism 
which is composed of Baby, a 
computer; Bonnie and Beanie, 
teleports; Jane, telekineticist ; 
and myself, telepath and central 
control. There isn’t a single thing 
about any of us that hasn’t been 
documented: the teleportation of 
the Yogi, the telekinetics of some 
gamblers, the idio-savant mathe- 
maticians, and most of all, the 
so-called poltergeist, the moving 
about of household goods 
through the instrumentation of a 
young girl. Only in this case 
every one of my parts delivers at 
peak performance. 

“Lone organized it, or it formed 
around him; it doesn’t matter 
which. I replaced Lone, but I 
Was too underdeveloped when he 
idled, and on top of that I got an 
Occlusion from that blast from 

f« 



Miss Kew., To that extent you 
were right when you said the 
blast made me subconsciously 
afraid to discover what . was in 
it. But there was another good 
reason for my not being able to 
get in under that ‘Baby is three’ 
barrier. 

“We rah into the problem of 
what it was I valued more than 
the security Miss Kew gave us. 
Can’t you see now what it was? 
My gestalt organism was at the 
point of death from that security. 
I figured she had to be killed or 
it — I — would be. Oh, the parts 
would live on : two little colored 
girls with a speech impediment, 
one introspective girl with an ar- 
tistic bent, one mongoloid idiot, 
and me — ninety per cent short- 
circuited potentials and ten per 
cent juvenile delinquent.” I 
laughed. “Sure, she had to be 
killed. It was self-preservation 
for the gestalt.” 

Stern bobbled around with his 
mouth and finally got out: “I 
don’t — ” 

“You don’t need to,” I laughed. 
“This is wonderful. You’re fine, 
hey, fine. Now I want to tell you 
this, because you can appreciate 
a fine point in your specialty. 
You talk about occlusions! I 
couldn’t get past the ‘Baby is 
three’ thing because in it lay the 
clues to what I really am. I 
couldn’t find that out because I 
was afraid to remember that I

failed in the thing I had to 
So to save the gestalt. Ain’t that 
purty?” 

“Failed? Failed how?” 

“Look. I came to love Miss 
Kew, and I’d never loved any- 
thing before. Yet I had reason to 
kill her. She had to be killed; I 
couldn't kill her. What does a hu- 
man mind do when presented 
with imperative, mutually exclu- 
sive alternatives?” 

“It — it might simply quit. As 
you phrased it earlier, it might 
blow a fuse, retreat, refuse to 
function in that area.” 

“Well, I didn’t do that. What 
else?” 

“It might slip into a delusion 
that it had already taken one of 
the courses of action.” 

T NODDED happily. “I didn’t 
kill her. I decided I must; I 
got up, got dressed — and the next 
thing I knew I was outside, wan- 
dering, very confused. I got my 
money — and I understand now, 

• with super-empa£hy, how I can 
win anyone’s prize contest — and 
I went looking for a head-shr ink - 
er. I found a good one.” 

“Thanks,” he said dazedly. He 
looked at me with a strangeness 
in his eyes. “And now that you 
know, what’s solved? What are 
you going to do?” 

“Go back home,” I said hap- 
pily. “Reactivate the super-or- 
ganism, exercise it secretly in

ways that won’t make Miss Kew 
unhappy, and We’ll stay with her 
as long as we know it pleases 
her. And we’ll please her. She’ll 
be happy in ways she’s never 
dreamed about until now. She 
rates it, bless her strait-laced, 
hungry heart.” 

“And she can’t kill your — ges- 
talt organism?” 

“Not a chance. Not now.” 
“How do you know it isn’t 
dead already?” 

“How?” I echoed. “How does 
your head know your arm 
works?” 

He wet his lips. “You’re going 
home to make a spinster happy. 
And after that?” 

I shrugged. “After that?” I 
mocked. “Did the Pekin man 
look 'at Homo Sap walking erect 
and say, ‘What will he do after 
that?’ We’ll live, that’s all, like 
a man, like a tree, like anything 
else that lives. We’ll feed and 
grow and experiment and breed. 
We’ll defend ourselves.” I spread 
my hands. “We’ll just do what 
comes naturally.” 

“But what can you do?.” 
“What can an electric motor 
do? It depends on where we ap- 
ply ourselves.” 

Stern was very pale. “But 
you’re the only such organism, . 

“Are we? I don’t know. I don’t 
think so. I’ve told you the parts 
have been around for ages — the 
telepaths, the poltergeists. What

was lacking was the ones to or- 
ganize, to be heads to the scatter- 
ed bodies. Lone was one, I’m one; 
there must be more. We’ll find 
out as we mature.” 

“You — aren’t mature yet?” 
“Lord, no!” I laughed. “We’re 
an infant. We’re the equivalent 
of about a three-year-old child. 
So you see, there it is again, and 
this time I’m not afraid of it: 
Baby is three.” I looked at my 
hands. “Baby is three,” I said 
again, because the realization 
tasted good, “And when this par- 
ticular group-baby is five, it 
might want to be a fireman. At 
eight, maybe a cowboy or maybe 
an FBI man. And when it grows 
up, maybe it’ll build a city, or 
perhaps it’ll be President.” 

“Oh, God!” he said. “God!” 
I looked down at him. “You’re 
afraid,” I said. “You’re afraid of 
Homo Gestalt.” 

He made a wonderful effort 
and smiled. “That’s bastard ter- 
minology.” 

“We’re a bastard breed,” I 
said. I pointed. “Sit over there.” 

H E crossed the quiet room and 
sat at the desk, I leaned close 
to him and he went to sleep with 
his eyes open. I straightened up 
and looked around the room. 
Then I got the thermos flask and 
filled it and put it on the desk. I 
fixed the corner of the rug and 
put a clean towel at the head of 



the couch. I went to the side of 
the desk and opened it and look- 
ed at the tape recorder. 

Like reaching out a hand, I 
got Beanie. She stood by the desk, 
wide-eyed. 

“Look here,” I told her. “Look 
good, now. What I want to do is 
erase all this tape. Go ask Baby 
how.” 

She blinked at me and sort of 
shook herself, and then leaned 
over the recorder. She was there 
— and gone — and back, just like 
that. She pushed past me and 
turned two knobs, moved a point- 
er until it clicked twice. The tape 
raced backward past the head 
swiftly, whining. 

“All right,” I said, “beat it.” 

She vanished. 

1 got my jacket and went to 
the door. Stern was still sitting at 
the desk, staring. 

“A good head-shrinker,” I 
murmured. I felt fine. 

Outside I waited, then turned 
and went back in again. 

Stern looked up at me. “Sit 
over there, Sonny.” 

“Gee,” I said. “Sorry, sir. I got 
in the wrong office.” 

“That’s all right,” he said. 

I went out and closed the door. 
All the way down to 'the store to 
buy Miss Kew some flowers, I 
was grinning about how he’d ac- 
count for the loss of an afternoon 
and the gain of a thousand bucks.

I T’S difficult, when you’re on 
one of the asteroids, to keep 
from tripping, because it’s 
almost impossible to keep your 
eyes on the ground. They never 
got around to putting portholes 
in spaceships, you know — unnec- 
essary when you’re flying by GB, 
and psychologically inadvisable. 



besides — so an asteroid is about 
the only place, apart from Luna, 
where you can really see the stars. 

There are so many stars in an 
asteroid sky that they look like 
clouds; like massive, heaped-up 
silver clouds floating slowly 
around the inner surface of the 
vast ebony sphere that surrounds

you and your tiny foothold. They 
are near enough to touch, and 
you want to touch them, but they 
are so frighteningly far away . 
and so beautiful: there’s nothing 
in creation half so beautiful as 
an asteroid sky. 

You don’t want to look down,, 
naturally. 

I HAD left the Lucky Pierre to 
search for fossils (I’m David 
Koontz, the Lucky Pierre's pa- 
leontologist). Somewhere off in 
the darkness on either side of me 
were Joe Hargraves, gadgeting 
for mineral deposits, and Ed 
Reiss, hopefully on the lookout 
for anything alive. The Lucky 
Pierre was back of us, her body 
out of sight behind a low black 
ridge, only her gleaming nose 
poking above like a porpoise 
coming up for air. When I looked 
back, I could see, along the jag- 
ged rim of the ridge, the busy 
reflected flickerings of the bubble- 
camp the techs were throwing 
together. Otherwise all was black, - 
except for our blue-white torch 
beams that darted here and there 
over the gritty, rocky surface. 

. The twenty-nine of us were 
E. T. I. Team 17, whose assign- 
ment was the asteroids. We were 
four years and three months out 
of Terra, and we’d reached Vesta 
right on schedule. Ten minutes 
after landing, we had known that 
the clod was part of the crust of 



Planet X — or Sorn, to give it hr 
right name — one of the few such 
parts that hadn’t been blown 
clean out of the Solar System. 

That made Vesta extra-special. 
It meant settling 'down for a 
while. It meant a careful, months- 
long scrutiny of Vesta’s every 
square inch and a lot of her cubic 
ones, especially by the life-scien- 
tists. Fossils, artifacts, animate 
-life ... a surface chunk of Sorn 
might harbor any of these, or all. 
Some we’d tackled already had 
a few. 

In a day or so, of course, we’d 
have the one-man beetles and 
crewboats out, and the floodlights 
orbiting overhead, and Vesta 
would be as exposed to us as a 
molecule on a microscreen. Then 
work would start in earnest. But 
in the meantime — and as usual — 
Hargraves, Reiss and I were out 
prowling, our weighted boots 
clomping along in darkness. Cap- 
tain Feldman had long ago given 
up trying to keep his science- 
minded charges from galloping 
off alone like this. In spite of 
being a military man, Feld’s a 
nice guy ; he just shrugs and says, 
“Scientists!” when we appeal 
brightly at the airlock, waiting to 
be let out. 

S O the three of us went our sep- 
arate ways, and ' soon were 
out of sight of one another. Ed 
Reiss, the biologist, was looking

hardest for animate life, natu- 
rally. 

But I found it. 

T HAD crossed a long, rounded 
expanse of rock — lava, won- 
derfully colored — and was de- 
scending into a boulder-cluttered 
pocket. I was nearing the “bot- 
tom” of the chunk, the part that 
had been the deepest beneath 
Sorn’s surface before the blow-up. 
It was the likeliest place to look 
for fossils. 

But instead of looking for fos- 
sils, my eyes kept rising to those 
incredible stars. You get that way 
particularly after several weeks 
of living in steel; and it was 
lucky that I got that way this 
time, or I might have missed the 
Zen. 

My feet tangled with a rock. 
1 started a slow, light-gravity fall, 
and looked down to catch my 
balance. My torch beam flickered 
across a small, red-furred teddy- 
bear shape. The light passed on. 
I brought . it sharply back to 
target. 

My hair did not stand on end, 
regardless of what you’ve heard 
me quoted as saying. Why should 
it have, when I already knew 
Yurt so well — considered him,, in 
fact, one of my closest friends? 

The Zen was standing by a 
rock, one paw resting on it, ears 
cocked forward, its stubby hind 
legs braced ready to launch it 



into flight. Big yellow eyes 
blinked unemotionally' at the 
glare of the torch, and I cut down 
its brilliance with a twist of the 
polarizer lens. 

The creature stared at me, 
looking ready to jump halfway 
to Mars or straight at me if I 
made a wrong move. 

I addressed it in its own lan- 
guage, clucking my tongue and 
whistling through my teeth: 
“Suh, Zen—” 

In the blue-white light of the 
torch," the Zen shivered. It didn’t 
say anything. I thought I knew 
why. Three thousand years of 
darkness and silence . 

I said, “I won’t hurt you,"® 
again speaking in its own lan- 
guage. 

The Zen moved away from the 
rock, but not away from me. It 
came a little closer, actually, and 
peered up at my helmeted, mir- 
ror-glassed head — unmistakably 
the seat of intelligence, it appears, 
of any race anywhere. Its mouth, 
almost human-shaped, worked; 
finally words came. It hadn’t 
spoken, except to itself, for three 
thousand years. 

“You . are not Zen,” it said. 
“Why — how do you speak Zen- 
nacai?” 

It took me a couple of seconds 
to untangle the squeaking syl- 
lables and get any sense out of 
them. What I had already said 
to it were stock phrases that Yurt

in mind, by the way: I barely “I am — last of Zen,” it said, 

knew the language, and the Zen I said nothing. I was studying 

could barely remember it. To it closely, looking for the features 
save space, the following dialogue which Yurt had described to us: 
is reproduced without bumblings, the lighter red fur of arms and 
blank stares and What-did-you- neck, the peculiar formation of

over an hour. domen. They were there. From 

“I am an Earthman,” I said, the coloring, I knew this Zen was 



Through my earphones, when I 
spoke, I could faintly hear my 
own voice as the Zen must have 
heard it in Vesta’s all but nonex- 
istent atmosphere: tiny, metallic, 
cricketlike. 

“Eert . mn?” 

I pointed ' at the sky, the in- 
credible sky. “From out there. 
From another .world.” 

It thought about that for a 
while. I waited. We already knew 
that the Zens had been better as- 
tronomers at their peak than we 
yrere right now, even though 
they’d never mastered space 
travel; so I didn’t expect this one 
to boggle at the notion of crea- 
tures from ■ another world. It 
didn’t. Finally it nodded, and I 
thought, as I had often before, 
how curious it was that this ges- 
ture should be common to Earth- 
men and. Zen. 

“So. Eert-mn” it said. “And 
you know what I am?” 

When I understood, I nodded, 
too. Then I said, “Yes,” realizing 



a female. 

The mouth worked again — not 
with emotion, I knew, but with 
the unfamiliar act of speaking. 

“I have been here for — for — ■” 
she hesitatecl — “I don’t know 
For five hundred of my years.’ 
“For about three thousand of 
mine,” I told her. ] 

A ND then blank astonishment 
sank home in me — astonish 
ment at the last two words of her 
remark. I was already familia 
with the Zens’ enormous intelli- 
gence, knowing Yurt as I did . , < 
but imagine thinking to qualify 
years with my when just out of 
nowhere a visitor from another 
planetary orbit pops up! And< 
there had been no special stress 
given the distinction, just clear, 
precise thinking, like Yurt’s. 

I added, still a little awed; 
“We know how long ago your 
world died.” 

“I was child then,” she said. 
“I don’t know — what happened,

I have wondered.” She looked up 
at my steel-and-glass face; I 
must have seemed like a giant. 
Well, I suppose I was. ‘‘This — • 
what we are on — was part of 
Sorn, I know. Was it — ” She 
fumbled for a word— “was it 
atom explosion?” f 

I told her how Sorn had gotten 
careless with its hydrogen atoms 
and had blown itself over half of 
creation. (This the E. T. I. Teams 
had surmised from scientific rec- 
ords found on Eros, as well as 
from geophysical evidence scat- 
tered throughout the other bod- 
ies.) 

“I was child,” she said again 
after a moment. “But I remem- 
ber — I remember things different 
from this. Air . heat . light 
• . how do I live here?” 

Again I felt amazement at its 
intelligence; (and it suddenly oc- 
curred to me that astronomy and 
nuclear physics must have been 
taught in Sorn’s “elementary 
schools” — else that -my years and 
atom explosion would have been 
all but impossible). And now this 
old, old creature, remembering 
back three thousand years to 
childhood — probably to those 
“elementary schools” — remem- 
bering, and defining the differ- 
ences in environment between 
then and now; and more, won- 
dering at its existence in the 
different now — 

And then I got my own think- 



ing straightened out. I recalled 
some of the things we had 
learned about the Zen. 

Their average lifespan had been 
12,000 years or a little over. So 
the Zen before me was, by our 
standards, about twenty - five 
years old. Nothing at alljstrange 
about remembering, when you 
are twenty-five, the things that 
happened to you when you were 
seven ... 

But the Zen’s question, even 
my rationalization of my reac- 
tion to it,- had given me a chill. 
Here was no cuddly teddy bear. 

This creature had been born 
before Christ! 

She had been alone for three 
thousand years, on a chip of bone 
from her dead world beneath a 
sepulchre of stars. The last and 
greatest Martian civilization, the 
L’hrai, had risen and fallen in 
her lifetime. And she was twenty- 
five years old. 

“How do I live here?” she 
asked again. 

I got back into my own frame- 
work of temporal reference, so 
to speak, and began explaining 
to a Zen what a Zen was. (I 
found out later from Yurt that 
biology, for the reasons which 
follow, was one of the most diffi- 
cult studies; so difficult that 
nuclear physics actually preceded 
it!) I told her that the Zen had 
been, all evidence indicated, the 
toughest, hardest, longest-lived 



ZEN

creatures God had ever cooked 
up: practically independent of 
their environment, no special 
ecological niche; just raw, stub- 
born, tenacious life, developed to 
a fantastic extreme — a greater 
force of life than any other 
known, one that could exist al- 
most anj' where under practically 
any conditions — even floating in 
midspace, which, asteroid or no, 
this Zen was doing right now. 
The Zens breathed, all right, 
but it was nothing they’d had 
to do in order to live. It gave 
them nothing their incredible me- 
tabolism couldn’t scrounge up 
out of rock or cosmic rays or 
interstellar gas or simply do with- 
out for a few thousand years. If 
the human body is a furnace, 
then the Zen body is a feeder 
pile. Maybe that, I thought, was 
what evolution always worked 
toward. 

“Please, will you kill me?” the 
Zen said. 

I ’D been expecting that. Two 
years ago, on the bleak surface 
©f Eros, Yurt had asked Engstrom 
to do the same thing. But I asked, 
“Why?” although I knew what 
the answer would be, too. 

The Zen looked up at me. She 
was exhibiting every ounce of 
emotion a Zen is capable of, which 
is a lot; and I could recognize 
it, but not in any familiar terms. 
A tiny motion hero, a quiver 



there, but very quiet and still for 
the most part. And that was the 
vjolent expression;" restraint,, 
Yurt, after two years of living 
with us, still couldn’t understand 
why we found this confusing. 

Difficult, aliens — or being alien. 

“I’ve tried so often to do it 
myself,” the Zen said softly. “But 
I can’t. I can’t even hurt myself. 
Why do I want you to kill me?” 
She was even quieter. Maybe she 
was crying. “I’m alone. Five hun- 
dred years, Eert-mn — not too 
long. I’m still young. But what 
good is it — life — when there are 
no other Zen?” 

“How do you know there are 
no other Zen?” 

fci: . 

“There are no others,” she said 
almost inaudibly. I suppose a hu- 
man girl might have shrieked it. 

A child , I thought, when your 
world blew up. And you survived. 
Now you’re a young three-thou- 
sand-year -old woman . unedu- 
cated, afraid, probably crawling 
with neuroses. Even so, in your 
thousand-year terms, young lady , 
you’re not too old to change. 

“Will you kill me?” she asked 
again. 

And suddenly I was having one 
of those eye-popping third-row • 
center views of the whole scene: 
the enormous, beautiful sky; the 
dead clod, Vesta; the little crea- 
ture who stood there staring at me 
—the brilliant-ignorant, human- 
like-alien, old-young creature who 



M 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was asking me to kill her. 

For a moment the human qual- 
ity of her thinking terrified me 
. the feeling you might have 
waking up seme night and find- 
ing your pet puppy sitting oh 
your chest, looking at you with 
wise eyes and white fangs gleam- 
ing . 

Then I thought of Yurt — 
smart, friendly Yurt, who had 
learned to laugh and wisecrack — 
and I came out of the jeebies. I 
realized that here was only a sick 
girl, no tiny monster. And if she 
were as resilient as Yurt . well, 
it was his problem. He’d probably 
pull her through. 

But I didn’t pick her up. I 
made no attempt to take her |sack 
to the ship. Her tiny white teeth 
and tiny yellow claws were 
harder than steel; and she was, i 
I knew, unbelievably strong for 
her size. If she got suspicious or 
decided to tl>row a phobic tizzy, 
she could scatter shreds of me 
over a square acre of Vesta in 
less time than it would take me 
to yelp. 

“Will you- — ” she began again, 

I tried shakily, “Hell, no. Wait 
here.” Then I had to translate it. 

T WENT back to the Lucky 
* Pierre and got Yurt. We could 
do without him, even though he 
had foe eh a big help. We’d taught 
him a lot— he’d been a child at 
the blow-up, too — and he’d 



taught us a lot. But this was 
more important, of course. 

When I told him what had 
happened, he was very quiet; cry- 
ing, perhaps, just like a human 
being, with happiness. 

Cap Feldman asked me what 
was up, and I told him, and he 
said, “Well, I’ll be blessed!” 

I said, “Yurt, are you sure you 
want us to keep hands off . 
just go off and leave you?” 

“Yes, please.” 

Feldman said, “Well, I’ll be 
blessed.” 

Yurt, who spoke excellent Eng- 
lish, said, “Bless you all.” 

I took him back to where the 
female waited. From the ridge, I 
knew, the entire crew was watch- 
ing through binocs. I set him 
down, and he fell to studying her 
intently. 

“I am not a Zen,” I told her, 
giving my torch full brilliance 
for the crew’s sake, “but Yurt 
here is. Do you see ... I mean, 
do you knew what you look 
like?” 

She said, “I can see enough of 
my own body to — and — yes . 

“Yurt,” I said, “here’s the fe- 
male we thought we might find. 
Take over.” 

Yurt’s eyes were fastened on 
the girl. 

“What — do I do now?” she 
whispered worriedly. 

“I’m afraid that’s something 
only a Zen would know,” I told 



ZEN

her, smiling inside my helmet. 
“I’m not a Zen. Yurt is." 

She turned to him. “You will 
tell me?" 

“If it becomes necessary.” He 
moved closer to her, not even 
looking back to talk to me. “Give 
us some time to get acquainted, 
will you, Dave? And you might 
leave some supplies and a bubble 
at the camp when you move on, 
just to make things pleasanter.” 

By this time he had reached 
the female. They were as still as 
space, not a sound, not a motion. 
I wanted to hang around, but I 
knew how I’d feel if a Zen, say, 
wouldn’t go away if I were the 
last man alive and had just met 
the last woman. 

I moved my torch off them 
and headed back for the Lucky 
Pierre. We all had a drink to the 
saving of a great race that might 
have become extinct. Ed Reiss, 
though, had to do some worrying 
before he could down his drink. 

“What if they don’t like each 
other?" lie asked anxiously. 

“They don’t have much 
choice,” Captain Feldman said, 
always the reatist. “Why do 
homely women fight for jobs on 
the most isolated space out- 



Reiss grinned. “That’s right 
They look awful good after a 
year or two in space.” 

“Make that twenty -five by Zen 
standards or three thousand by 
ours,” said Joe Hargraves, “and 
I’ll bet they look beautiful to 
each other.” 

We decided to drop our inves- 
tigation of Vesta for the time 
being, and come back to it after 
the honeymoon. * 

Six months later, when we re- 
turned, there were twelve hun- 
dred Zen on Vesta! 

Captain Feldman was a realist 
but he was also a deeply moral 
man. He went to Yurt and said, 
“It’s indecent! Couldn’t the two 
of you control yourselves at least 
a little? Twelve hundred kids!" 

“We were rather surprised our- 
selves,” Yurt said complacently. 
“But this seems to be how Zen 
reproduce. Can you have only 
half a child?” 

Naturally, Feld got the author- 
ities to quarantine Vesta. Good 
God, the Zen could push us clear 
out of the Solar System in a cou- 
ple of generations! 

I don’t think they would, but 
you can’t take such chances, can 
you?

Wait for Weight

W HEN Dr. Allport Brin- 
ton’s alarm clock sound- 
ed, it brought madness. 
It was very clever; it not only 
rang chimes of amazing pene- 
trating power, it turned on all 
the lights in the room, closed the 
window, and started his bath wa- 
ter running. But this morning it 
was not appreciated. In fact, as 
Dr. Brinton gpt o6t of bed, he 
Mlently called down evil on the 
technician who had built it for 
him. 



The “off” switch was on the 
wall farthest away from his bed 
and was controlled by a hairtrig- 
ger combination dial that couldn’t

be operated by anyone not fully 
awake. Dr. Brinton fumbled for 
a while, then gave up and started 
looking for his bedroom slippers. 
They had apparently crawled 
away during the night. 

He padded into his bathroom 
barefoot. He was about to see 
what a hot bath would do for 
what he had already diaghosed as 
a histamine headache when the 
alarm clock, having decided that 
anyone who could sleep through 
ten minutes of chiming was un- 
wakable, stopped chiming, turned 
off the lights, opened the win- 
dow, and let all the water out. 

Dr. Brinton was walking back 
toward the light switch when he 
tripped on his bedroom slippers 
and fell back into bed. No further 
invitation was necessary; he slept 
till noon. 

Dr. Brinton unmistakably had 
a hangover. Considering the party 
he had attended the night before, 
it was not surprising. Actually, it 
was remarkable that he had been 
able to get out of bed at all. Dur- 
ing the fourteen years that the 
Rocket Research Station had 
been in operation, the parties that 
were held every time another test 
flight resulted in failure had 
grown from a few drinks in some- 
body’s room to a mammoth bust- 
up that left the whole place 
partially paralyzed for days af- 
terward. 

First as chief chemist, and later 



as director of the Station, Dr. 
Brinton had attended every on*- 
of the scores of parties durin>- 
every one of the fourteen years 
It spoke well for his endurance to 
say that he was back at his office 
at one o’clock. Some people didn’t 
make it until the next day. 

H IS secretary, who didn't 
drink, was one of very few 
who were at work on time. She 
walked into his office and stood 
in front of his desk, tapping her 
foot. Her facial expression showed 
that she thought people who got 
drunk at parties were amoral, de- 
generate, and entirely unfit for 
administrative positions. Dr. 
Brinton, who had been, mentally 
comparing the relative merits of 
Prussic acid and hanging as pain 
relievers, sat up straight to prove 
that he was moral, alert, and 
ready for any problem that might . 
come up. His secretary sniffed to 
indicate that she didn’t believe 
him. Dr. Brinton dropped his eyes 
to admit that maybe he wasn’t at 
his best at the moment, but it was 
only a temporary condition, and 
by tomorrow he would be okay j 
“In two minutes you’ll wish 
you were dead,’’ said his secre 
tary. “Read this.” ; 

She handed him a letter. He \ 
read it and his knuckles cracked 
as he gripped the arms of his '• 
chair. 

Senator MacNeill coming to : 



visit here? ’ he cried in alarm. 
Though his voice was squeaky, 
he was surprised to hear it at all. 
* Get me a line to Washington, 
our top priority, Audrey at the 
Naval Department.” 

The calj was put through. 
“Commander Audrey? This is 
Brinton at the Station, Joe 
MacNeill is coming to visit us. 
Can you head him off? ... 

“Yes, I know, but he’s on one 
of his economy drives. We just 
did a test yesterday and if he 
inspects this place now, we won’t 
get enough money to build a pin- 
ball machine. Delay him a week, 
anyway ... 

“Well, try. I’ll arrange a tour 
for him as best I can, but if he 
doesn’t come. I’ll be much hap- 
pier. Let me know as soon as 
possible. Fine. Good-by.” 

He scribbled a memo and car- 
ried it out .to his secretary. “Copy 
of this to all department heads, 
right away. Phone the commis- 
sary and have them get all the 
decorations taken down in the 
dining room. Tell them to lay in 
some steaks for tomorrow. Phone 
Harry Sparling in Public Rela- 
tions— alert him V.V.I.P. tomor- 
row, extra-special tour including 
all our movies on the subject. 
I’m going over to the Fuels De- 
partment.” 

Dr. Ferber, head of Fuels, met 
Dr. Brinton at the door of his lab, 
“I just got your memo,” he 

WAIT FOR WEIGHT 



said. “Is that budget-butcher 
really coming down here?” 

Dr. Brinton nodded his head 
gently. “I’m afraid so. I came 
over to see what kind of show we 
can put on for him.” 

“We have some samples to rus 
on the indoor motors. There are 
a couple of loads left for the 
acceleration sled. And I suppose 
if we work all night we could get 
a sergeant-major ready, but if 
he’s on an economy drive that 
might bq too elaborate. Just a 
view of everybody pouring stuff 
from one test-tube to another 
might be best.” 

“Do the samples and run the 
sled once,” Dr. Brinton said. 
“That should provide enough fire 
and noise. The rest of it will have 
to be fast talk. I think I’ll go 
home to bed.” 

BRINTON considered 
” himself a methodical man. 
He had bacon and eggs every 
morning for breakfast. He always 
took a vitamin pill with his af- 
ternoon coffee. And he was used 
to exactly eight hours sleep. It 
was this last habit that caused 
him to wake up that night at 
midnight; he had gone to bed at 
four that afternoon and habit is 
a hard thing to break. At first he 
thought it was morning, but a 
glance at his watch hanging on 
its illuminated pedestal corrected 
that 



7 3 



He grunted, rolled over, and 
waited for sleep to overtake him 
again. Nothing happened. He 
turned and Stared at the ceiling 
for a while. Still nothing; he had 
not felt so wide awake for a long 
time. Then he was struck by one 
of the flashes of inspiration that 
had made him famous — he would 
raid the refrigerator. 

D ownstairs, he found that 

his son Eric had anticipated 
him by two minutes, and was 
busy setting the table with cheese, 
pickles, ice cream, peanut butter, 
and everything else necessary to 
keep a sixteen-year-old boy op- 
erating at peak efficiency. A pile 
of books on the table indicated 
that he had just finished his 
homework. Dr. Brinton was 
pleased that his son had worked 
so late, but the choice of food 
made him shudder. He rummaged 
In the refrigerator himself, found 
a cold pork chop that Eric had 
somehow overlooked, and bore 
it to the table in triumph. 

“We were dealt a blow today,” 
he said, between mouthfuls. 

“Oh?” said Eric, on guard in 
case it was about his school work. 

“Received word that Senator 
MacNeill is coming here tomor- 
row. No, today — it’s after mid- 
night.” 

“Oh ” It was an “dh” of re- 
lief. A senator couldn’t be nearly 
as troublesome as a teacher. 



“Don’t say ‘oh’ like that. He’ll 
probably close the Station tight 
and we’ll all be out of work. You 
don’t realize, it, but money has 
been getting harder and harder 
to cadge for this place. We’re 
practically running only the 
Fuels department now.” 

He got up, threw the bone from 
his pork chop into a garbage pail, 
washed his hands at the sink, and 
sat down again. 

He continued, “Wait till he 
finds out about those four re- 
actor rockets that are cooling off 
on the Moon, waiting for us to 
get there. I can hear him scream, 
‘Five million dollars each! Each 
full of precious equipment, to say 
nothing of invaluable fissionable 
material!’ And then this place 
gets shut down.” 

Eric had a suggestion. “Give 
him the old routine about how 
we have to get men to the Moon 
or the Russians will do it first 
and use all the equipment we’ve 
sent there without even thanking 
us.” 

“Umm,” said his father, con- 
sidering, He shook his head final- 
ly. “His answer to that is why 
send good money after bad. No. 
I just hope he feels better after 
a steak dinner. Either that or the 
wings fall “ off his plane.” He 
smiled wistfully at the thought. 
“Oh, well,” he said, “let’s go to 
bed.” * 

They went their separate ways,

but only Eric went to bed. His 
father entered the library, sat 
down, got his pipe going, and 
began to reread How to Win 
Friends . and Influence People. 

' -* 

t'T'HE next day saw Dr. Brinton 
contemplate suicide, homi- 
cide, and voting Republican, 
though riot necessarily in that 
order. The Senator had viewed 
their most inspiring onward-and- 
upward movies and merely asked 
how much they cost to make. He 
had eaten a huge steak at the 
commissary, and then inspected 
the garbage cans for waste. His 
visits to various departments had 
been marred by his lack of in- 
terest in anything except the 
number of men employed by each 
and their average salaries, though 
he did comment that they all 
looked hung-over. In the Fuels 
Department, he had walked out 
on the demonstrations, interrupt- 
ing some actual experiments that 
were going on outside the test 
room. 

Dr. Brinton was now riding in 
the back of a jeep, explaining to 
the Senator that nuclear rockets 
were not too efficient, and the 
shielding necessary to make them 
safe for men weighed more than 
their payload. The Senator noted 
down the word “inefficient.” 

A loudspeaker on a pole a little 
farther down the road interrupted 
the explanation. “Twenty-five, 



twenty-five, twenty - five, *"■ it 
shouted. “Five-nine, eighteen. 
Five-nine, eighteen. Seventy- 
three, ten-eight.” It began to re- 
peat the message. 

The driver, who had slowed 
while they listened to the mes- 
sage, turned the jeep around and 
sped them back the other way 

“What in Heaven’s name was 
that?” asked the Senator, who 
was busy hanging on. 

“Twenty -five means emergen- 
cy,” shouted Dr. Brinton. “Five 
and nine is fire and explosion in 
the Fuels Department, which is 
eighteen. Seventy-three is my call 
number and ten -eight means they 
want me to get there in a hurry.” 

For the first time, the Senator 
looked impressed. Then he grew 
angry again when his hat blew off 
and the driver wouldn’t stop to 
go back and get it. The jeep took 
a shortcut across the concrete 
fence, and left tire marks in the 
grass in front of the Fuels De- 
partment. Dr. Brinton jumped 
out and ran into the building, 
leaving the Senator to argue with 
the driver about going back for 
the hat. 

The lab outside the test room 
was dusty and littered with 
broken glass. Two technicians 
were receiving first aid for minor 
cuts, but everyone else seemed 
to be in an almost holiday mood. 

Dr. Ferber saw Dr. Brinton 
standing iri the doorway and

came over to him immediately, fourth time when he noticed that 
“That telephone operator gets his feet were getting wet. His 
too excited.” he said. “There’s kick must have jammed some re- 



no fire, and I think it was an 
implosion, not an explosion. 
Wrecked our new pressure cata- 
lyzer. Harrison’s gone to hospi- 
tal and the two you see are hurt, 
but none of it’s very serious. I 
suppose Butcher Boy is going to 
put this down in his little note- 
book, too.” 

“If you are referring to me,” 
said the Senator’s voice behind 
them, “I most certainly am going 
to make a note of it. And I 
suggest you both start adver- 
tising for other jobs.” 

J[pRINTON had been indulging 
in a pleasant little fantasy in 
which he had cut Senator Mac- 
Neill up into twenty-eight pieces, 
placed them in aluminum cans, 
and made them radioactive in 
the Station pile. He was smiling 
at the newsreel cameras, about to 
fire the first Senator-powered 
spaceship in the history of man- 
kind, when his alarm clock, which 
had maliciously been waiting for 
just such an opportunity, spoiled 
his dream by waking him up. 

That was how the next day 
started. It continued in the same 
vein when, in a fit of petulance, 
he strode into his clothes closet 
and kicked the alarm control box, 
barefoot. He was working the 
combination dial for the third or 



lays in the control box; the bath 
water was overflowing. Since the 
box was sealed to prevent him 
from fooling with it, he had had 
to prevent a flood by limping 
downstairs and pulling the mas- 
ter switch. 

With no electricity, his break- 
fast consisted of cold fruit juice, 
cold cereal, and cold milk. When 
he got to his office, he ordered a 
pot of coffee and made out a 
requisition for a pipe wrench. If 
it ever happened again, he was 
going to shut the water off in-r 
stead. 

His secretary came in with the 
coffee and poured him a cup. 

“I have some letters for you to 
sign,” she said brightly, to cheer 
him up. Dr. Brinton drank his 
coffee. “Our new filing system is 
working very well,” she added, 
pouring him another cup. The 
doctor’s face relaxed a little, but 
it was because the snow bank in 
his stomach was beginning to 
melt. His secretary played her 
trump. “And somebody from the 
Fuels Department phoned and 
said something was passing the 
yellow line and might make the 
blue.” 

She was never sure afterward 
whether Dr. Brinton had gone 
around his desk, or over it. She 
had blinked and by the time her

eyes were open again, he was 
gone. 

Dr. Brinton found a crowd in 
the indoor test lab, chuckling 
over the line being drawn by a 
differential analyzer. He elbowed 
his way to the front, looked him- 
self, and began a little dance of 
impatience. The . analyzer was 
connected with linkages to the 
test stand where a tiny rocket 
motor was thrusting out a hot 
blue pencil of flame. The results 
from the analyzer were plotted 
as range capability against time 
on a piece of graph paper which 
had four curved colored lines 
overprinted on it. The curved 
lines were marked in succession: 
“Earth,” ‘‘Moon,” “Moon” and 
“Earth.” 

If the first Earth line, colored 
red, was passed, the fuel under 
test could power a rocket to leave 
Earth, carrying men with it. If 
the yellow line— the first Moon 
line — was reached, the rocket 
could theoretically land men on 
the Moon. Several rockets, carry- 
ing dummy' loads, had already 
tried and failed: their fuels, 

though the best available, barely 
reached the yellow line when 
under test. 

The blue — second — Moon line 
was calculated to indicate an es- 
cape from, the Moon without re- 
fueling, and the last line, in green, 
was. a theoretical powered land- 
ing back on Earth.

The pen of the analyzer had 
already passed the blue line and 
was more than halfway to the 
green* 

“FTThis is the stuff that was left 
in the catalyzer after the ex- 
plosion yesterday!” Dr. Ferber 
shouted to Dr. Brinton over the 
roar from the little engine. “It 
looked as if it would bum, so 
I tested it. Jackpot!” 

“What is it?” asked Dr. Brin- 
ton. 

“Supposed to be an artificial 
base for a perfume!” 

The last word seemed louder 
because the test rocket just then 
ran out of fuel and grew silent. 
The tracing of the pen stopped 
a fraction short of the green line. 

Dr. Ferber continued in his 
normal voice while he busied 
himself with the connections of 
the engine: “We didn’t have any- 
thing to do to put on a show for 
MacNeill yesterday, so I told 
the lads to carry on with ex- 
periments of their own. It was 
Harrison who made this stuff. 
He was cut by flying glass and 
landed in the hospital. I phoned 
there this morning and found the 
damn fool doctor took his appen- 
dix out. Said he figured he might 
as well while Harrison was in 
there. He’s still under the an- 
esthetic and we won’t be able to 
ask him anything for several 
hours.”

“Doesn’t matter,’* said Dr. 
Brinton. “We know it works; we 
have to find out why it works. 
Got any left? We’ll analyze it.” 
The next few hours saw Dr. 
Brinton rapidly become a bitter 
and disillusioned man. 

When a qualitative test inform- 
ed them that the presence of 
nitrogen meant they were going 
to have to use an even longer and 
more laborious process than the 
ordinary one, he uttered a few 
sentences that made a couple of 
nearby German exchange stu- 
dents wonder if perhaps they 
hadn’t a portion missed in the 
English language learning. 

When he found that he had 
forgotten his pipe at home, and 
the analysis required too much 
of their attention to allow him 
to go home and get it, he quoted 
a paragraph or two that earned 
him the undivided attention of 
everyone in the lab. 

But when he took the results 
ever to a calculator and worked 
them out to carbon 281.6% he 
had barely started the prologue 
■when frustration overtook him 
and he subsided, speechless. He 
was at a loss to say or do any- 
thing except mumble that 281.6% 
was impossible. 

D R. BERBER came over and 
took the paper with the re- 
sults from him. Everyone in the 
lab watched while he checked the 



calculations patiently. 

A delegation minutely checked 
the apparatus the two doctors 
had used; it was faultless. One 
person even went so far as to cast 
a suspicious look at the big auto- 
matic micro -balance standing on 
its pedestal in the center of the 
room. He weighed a piece of 
paper, wrote his name on it in 
pencil and reweighed it. The 
difference was satisfactory. For 
a few moments, they all just 
stood and looked at each other. 
Then the whole lot of them set 
to work. 

A junior technician headed for 
the spectrograph, came back in 
three minutes with a freshly de- 
veloped spectral photograph and 
a puzzled look. He spent some 
time comparing both of them 
with the illustrations in a manual 
entitled Structural Formulae as 
Indicated by Spectral Groupings. 

The two German exchange 
students made a few tries at 
finding the class of compound. 
They soon were deep in a tech- 
nical discussion in their own lang- 
uage, the only recognizable words 
being “biuret,” “dumkopf,” and 
“damn.” 

A senior research - chemist tried 
crystalizing some and invented 
an entirely new swear word. 

With four helpers, Dr. Brinton 
and Dr. Ferber redid the com- 
bustion analysis in slightly less 
than twice the tirqe it would have 



7S 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



taken only one of them. Of course 
they were assured of accuracy; 
each ' step was checked at least 
twice by everyone. 

The result was still carbon 

281 . 6 %. •- 

Dr. Brinton escaped the en- 
suing mental paralysis since he 
had already been through the ex- 
perience once. He went over and 
began to study the figures writ- 
ten in on the side of the spectral 
photograph. Out of little more 
than idle curiosity,- he compared 
the ratios of the rough quanti- 
tative estimate found spectro- 
graphically with the more 
accurate but impossible answer of 
the combustion micro-analysis. 

While he was doing the neces- 
sary figuring, he listened sympa- 
thetically to the technician. The 
young man was complaining bit- 
terly about things in general, and 
chemistry in particular. Chemi- 
cal reference books came in for 
a special roasting, because; 
“either that lousy book is in- 
complete, or this structural for- 
mula is out of this world.” 

That did it. 

Brinton got out a scratch pad 
and drew a little diagram. 

Then he went to talk to Dr. 
Ferber. 

“Would it be possible that 
Harrison started with a multi- 
ringed phenol?” he asked. Dr. 
Ferber nodded. Dr. Brinton show- 
ed him the drawing. “Does that 



remind you of any >_ 
figure?” 

Dr. Ferber looked. There was 
a pause, then his eyes lit up. 

“Of course,” he said. “Since 
formulae are usually drawn in 
one plane, I doubt if anyone 
ever noticed that before. And 
when it comes under stress by 
compression, it’s only natural 
that it should fold.” He paused 
and looked at the calendar, 
“Four weeks?” he asked. 

“That’ll do fine,” said Dr. Brin- 
ton. “I’ll arrange the details. You 
look after the fuel. Harrison can 
give us the details of this one, 
but there are probably any num- 
ber of fuels based on this princi- 
pal. Some will be even more 
efficient, too.” 

He excused himself, went to a 
phone, and asked for a Washing- 
ton number. The call was answer- 
ed, 

“Hello, Senator MacNeill?” he 
said. “How would you like to be 
guest of honor at a party ?” 

TiRINTON peered through the 
ring of reporters over to the 
head table where Senator Mac- 
Neill was speaking, and speaking, 
and speaking. 

“He’s on his home state,” Dr, 
Brinton said. “About half an 
hour to go. Now, gentlemen, you 
were asking about the new fuel. 
You all received press handouts 
containing the information. You 



WAIT FOR WEIGHT 



79 



will probably receive copies of 
the Senator’s speech. And the 
broadcast from our first men on 
the Moon went out over several 
networks hours ago. It seems to 
me that you have enough for sev- 
eral stories.” 

One of the reporters asked be- 
wilderedly, “What is a tesseract? 
I read the handout twice and I 
still don’t understand.” 

“A mathematician would be 
better qualified to explain,” said 
Dr. Brinton, “but I’ll try. A tes- 
seract is a fourth dimensional 
cube. A line has one dimension, 
a square has two, a cube has 
three, and a tesseract has four. A 
cube can be unfolded into six 
squares, and a tesseract unfolds 
to eight cubes. The new fuel had 
a molecular structure resemb- 
ling an unfolded tesseract. When 
pressure is applied,' it folds up 
into a tesseract so that it takes up 
less room and relieves the pres- 
sure. 

‘'The practical application is 
that we can get eight pounds of it 
into a one pound can. The other 
seven pounds of it are riding 
around in the fourth dimension. 
As soon as it starts to burn, the 
structure is destroyed, so that it 
comes back out of the fourth di- 
mension. Several people have as- 
sured me that it can’t work. 



They’re probably right, excej :. 
that it does. Oh, I’ll be back h. 
a minute.” 

He went over to another group 
and spoke to one of its members. 
The man addressed nodded his 
head and left. Dr. Brinton re- 
turned. 

“If there are no more questions, 
I suggest we do some serious 
drinking. I am now out of a job 
and I want to celebrate.” 

P ROMPTLY at seven-thirty, a 
relay clicked and the alarm 
clock went into its usual daily 
routine with the chimes, window, 
lights, and bath water. 

Dr. Brinton woke up enough to 
reach out a lazy arm and flip a 
newly installed toggle switch be- 
side his bed. Everything returned 
to normal. The light and the 
chimes both faded away, the win- 
dow reopened, and a soft gurgling 
came from the bathroom. 

A slight gurgling also came 
from the bed, where Dr. Brinton, 
with a happy little smile on his 
face, had gone peacefully back 
to sleep, perfectly satisfied that 
he had worked himself into un- 
employment by finding the fuel 
that would power spaceships to 
— and from — any part of the So- 
lar System.

TW World of 2052 

W ABC has just written a 
letter to the future and 
I helped to write it— 
more precisely, I talked part of

when finished, was broadcast and 
is now safely buried in a place 
where it will not deteriorate, m

be taken out and rebroadeast a 
century from now. 

Naturally, i't is reminiscent of 
the Westinghouse Time Capsule 
which was buried on the World’s 
Fair Grounds a dozen years ago, 
to enlighten the inhabitants of 
this planet 5000 years from now 
about the doings of the year 
1940. During the same year, a 
Time Vault was started in North 
Carolina, intended to preserve for 
posterity the books which we 
consider most important in our 
day. 

This idea of writing letters to 
the future is not exactly new. For 
centuries, European master build- 
ers enclosed documents, contem- 
porary coin of the realm and an 
occasional chronicle in the foun- 
dation stones of buildings, and 
American builders took over the 
tradition. 

Trouble is that in those cases 
where the contents were recover^- 
ed and examined, it turned out 
that the documents told things 
which we already knew from 
other sources, and that the coins 
were well known to numismatists 
and often not even rare. Still, one 
wishes that this habit had been 
established much earlier, say in 
Greek or at least Roman times. 

But the only Roman example 
of such a Time Vault was not an 
intentional one. About half a 
century ago, the learned world 
was startled and excited by the 

m, ‘ * i 



announcement that a rich Ro- * 
man’s private library had been 
found in Pompeii. It had been 
-buried when Mt. Vesuvius let go 
in what is probably the most 
publicized and romanticized vol- 
canic outbreak of all recorded 
history. The rolls of parchment 
were charred, of course. They had 
dried out in the interim and were 
so fragile that they could not be 
handled in any usual way. Still, 
methods of transporting them, 
unrolling them and finally read- 
ing them were worked out. And 
then it turned out that the origi- 
nal owner of that library had been 
a fanatic disciple of a small and 
completely unimportant philoso- 
phical school. After all that labor, 
it was a sad disappointment. 

T HE so-called Document Cave 
not far from the Dead Sea in 
Palestine, which was found re- 
cently, promises better results. 
At the very least, our knowledge 
of the history of the books of the 
Old Testament is going to be im- 
proved by that discovery^ And 
that Document Cave might even 
have been meant as a kind of 
Time Vault, for the documents 
seem to have been hidden there s 
from contemporaries for the fu- / 
ture, although the men who did 
it may have had only three or ; 
four generations in mind — not 
sixty or more, as it turned out to 
be. 

ALAXY SCIi NCI FICTION 



TN a somewhat larger sense, 
every book written is a small 
time capsule. For while a book is 
primarily addressed to contem- 
poraries, it is expected or hoped 
to last into the future. I can get 
first-hand information about the 
knowledge and beliefs of Gains 
Plinius Secundus (Pliny the El- 
der) directly from the shelves of 
my own library. It isn’t an orig- 
inal, but it is serviceable. Even 
originals last a long time, though. 
If I want to find out what the 
famous Municipal Physician of 
Zurich, Dr. Konrad Gesner, 
thought and knew about fossils 
in 1560, my library will serve, too. 
And this book was not preserved 
through the centuries in some 
Time Vault; it survived through 
the interest and care of genera- 
tions of people. 

The most interesting contents 
of any Time Capsule would be 
those portions in which its orig- 
inators tell the future finders their 
guesses about the civilization, 
habits, etc., of the finders. But, 
again, it need not be a specific 
Time Capsule; it can be simply 
a book which has been preserved. 

As has been pointed out in, 
GALAXY by L. Sprague de 
Camp, we are just beginning to 
reap that kind of harvest from 
early examples of science fiction. 
If we are somewhat flabbergasted 
at the lack of vision of daring of 
those writers, and more than a 



little astounded by the nonsense 
which we were supposed to in- 
dulge in — not that we don’t in- 
dulge in different kinds of 
nonsense of our own designing— 
it should merely prove to us that 
we should be more daring in 
some respects and more careful 
in others. 

Now let’s see if I can apply 
that advice myself. 

As I told my audience of a 
hundred years hence, I think — - 
lots of printed paper to the con- 
trary notwithstanding — that 
cities will not be obsolete. Nor do 
I think that the wheeled vehicle 
will be obsolete, having been re- 
placed by the helicopter, or by 
some other device yet to be 'in - 
vented. Nor do I believe that the 
day of the printed word has al- 
most reached its end. 

Having a little more space here 
in the magazine than I had time 
on the air, I would like to elab- 
orate a bit on these statements. 
With and without reference to 
atomic bombs, we have been in- 
formed that “cities are abnor- 
mal.” Now, cities had originally 
the purpose of being trading 
centers. Later, they also became 
manufacturing centers. And you 
can’t say that those who settled 
inr the cities did it because of ne- 
cessity. Then, as now, the major- 
ity did it from choice. 

It is obviously more convenient 
to be in the center of things than 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



ss 



in the outskirts. And having 
lived in the country, I know from 
personal experience that it ,is not 
convenient. If you get there dur- 
ing a heat wave, it may look that 
way, and the little walk of 5500 
feet for a newspaper or' some 
smokes or even your mail, down 
a winding road, may be pleasant. 
But try it on a cold winter day, 
when the road is icy and has 
eight .inches of loose snow on top. 
Try to take care of unexpected 
guests, unless your basement is 
a private grocery store. Try to 
enjoy (or even be attentive) in 
a movie if you know that the last 
bus home comes by just five 
minutes after the show; especial- 
ly, if you also know that just the • 
last bus is often early because the 
driver wants to go home, too. 

In spite of what moralists and 
real estate agents tell us, the 
country home is convenient only 
if you also have a city home. And 
since people have the deplorable 
habit of looking after their own 
convenience, cities are neither ab- 
normal nor obsolescent. 

A nother item i brought up 
in my broadcast was trans- 
portation. Will people ride in 
from sixty miles away in their 
own helicopters? Well, some may, 
of course, but that isn’t the prop- 
er answer. 

The helicopter, once it gets to 
be easier to fly than the current 

M 



production models, will have a 
great deal of advantages over 
the ground car. But it still needs 
parking space at the other end 
and the traffic problems of the 
modern city are not caused by 
the cars which, move, but by 
those which are parked. 

The solution is obviously a 
type of transpoitation which does 
not park, but keeps moving. 

Just imagine how easy it would 
be to get around in New York if 
all the transportation available 
were public transportation — sub- 
ways, elevateds, busses and taxi- 
cabs. The remedy for the future 
might not be up to the engineer 
only, but to the lawmakers as 
well. 

This is not the place to go into 
the design of a city free of traffic 
problems. I just want to add that, 
while it has been proved that a 
large city can be supplied by air 
lift, it is neither a cheap nor a 
logical method of doing it. 

Finally: I do think that the 
people a hundred years from now 
will still buy newspapers and 
read books. I also believe that 
these books and papers will be 
printed — presumably with a more 
lavish use of color than nowadays 
— on paper. I don’t believe in the 
“electronic device” which replaces 
the newspaper, nor in the news- 
paper printed photographically 
on a piece of plastic the size of 
a special delivery stamp. All you 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



have to do is insert it in the pro- 
jector and the letters will appear 
on the ceiling of your bedroom. 
You can read it while having 
breakfast in bed. Damned in- 
convenient is all I have to say. 

I’ll go along with the tape re- 
corder attached to the telephone 
which will take messages — “the 
deadline is really today, but since 
you were kept busy with two tele- 
vision shows and three confer- 
ences, it can be extended until 
Saturday”— while you are away. 
I go along with that because there 
you have an electrical device, 
your telephone, to begin with, 
and it can be adapted for play- 
back. 

But the printed word is supe- 
rior to any recording device or 
projector in several respects, each 
important. You can read it in 
any position you happen to pre- 
fer at the moment. You need no 
special reconverting tool. No mat- 
tet how simple, small, light and 
fool and tinkerproof that device 
is postulated to be, you can for- 
get or mislay it. And, like any- 
thing else, it can run down or go 
out of order. Also, you can easily 
add a note or a reminder to the 
printed word. Furthermore, you 
can file a piece of newspaper. Of 
course you can file pieces 6f 
sound tape, too, or plastic micro - 
slides, but then you need your 
reconverting device to find out 
what’s on it. 



Nor do I think that books will 
be printed on anything which we 
would not call paper, even though 
it may technically be something 
else. In quite a number of stories, 
the spaceship pilot looks up the 
characteristics of a planet in an 
almanac “printed on indestruc- 
tible metal foil” and this practice, 
for all one can tell, was not re- 
stricted to the spaceman’s alma- 
nac in those stories. 

Let’s see now. My own Rockets, 
Missiles and Space Travel has 
very nearly reached the bulk 
where it becomes a little hard to 
handle. I just measured and 
weighed it. The dimensions are 
8V2 x 6 x IV2 inches and its 
papier is about as thin as it can 
be and still be decent. In any 
event, I don’t think that metal 
foil could be any thinner than 
that paper and still take inscrip- 
tions of some kind on both sides. 
Hence the dimensions would be 
the same as those of the paper 
book. 

But while the paper book, with 
binding, weighs two lbs., the 
metal book, if aluminum, would 
weigh nine pounds! 

I’m all in favor of a non-yel- 
lowing, non-cracking permanent 
paper for books. But no metal 
foil, please, unless you can come 
up with a useful lithium alloy of 
a specific gravity of 0.5 or less. 

Well, there you have a dis- 
course on things that won’t hap-

pen. Go back to the stories now 
end see what might. 

RED FEATHERS 

I F you’ll be patient for about 
100 seconds. I’ll get around to 
the theme. Those 100 seconds 
have to be used to lay the ground- 
work. The subject of today’s lec- 
ture about surprise developments 
is a bird. 

The name: Turacu s (or Cory- 
thaix ) leucotis. 

Common name: touraco. 
Habitat: southern Africa. 

Date of discovery: not known 
(at least not to me), but it must 
have been early, for the bird is 
not rare. 

Coloration: back, bluish-black; 
tail, ditto, with some green 
in it; leading edge of wings, 
bluish-black (minor individual 
changes) ; neck and breast, bright 
green; whitish markings on neck 
and head; yellow and red crest; 
main wing feathers, bright red. 

Now the story. In 1818, a 
French explorer by the name of 
Jules Verreaux was camping in 
southern Africa. It was during the 
rainy season, the sky was gray 
with clouds, water dripped from 
every branch and every leaf, and 
the soil was almost too soggy to 
walk on. It was decidedly the 
kind of weather for staying in- 
doors, but Jules Verreaux did not. 
He made short trips of a few 

•6 



hours’ duration at a time, partly 
because he wanted to see how the 
wild animals were faring during 
the rainy season, partly because 
he was no doubt bored with the 
unchanging meteorology. 

On one of his short trips, he 
came across a flock of birds which 
were sitting around in the bushes, 
dripping with rain water and 
looking unhappy. When Verreaux 
approached them, they tried to 
fly away, but they were too wet 
to take off. 

Verreaux tried to catch one 
with his bare hands and finally 
succeeded, but the wet bird strug- 
gled free. Verreaux then saw that 
his hand was dripping with red 
liquid. His first thought was that 
he had been pecked by the strug- 
gling bird, even though he had 
not felt any pain and could not 
find the wound. Upon closer ob- 
servation, he noticed that the liq- 
uid, while red, did not look like 
blood. It did not seem plausible, 
but he could only conclude that 
the color had come off the red 
feathers of the wet bird. And after 
his return to France, he reported 
that there was a bird in South 
Africa afflicted with a plumage 
that was not color-fast in the rain. 

This, of course, was ridiculous 
Color may wash out of cheap 
manmade fabrics, but not , bird 
feathers, most especially not 
while said feathers were still at- 
tached to a live bird. Just to 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



prove how ridiculous these claims 
were, stuffed touracos were taken 
from the shelves in museums, a 
red feather or two clipped off and 
put in a glass of water. The result 
was as expected : the feathers 
stayed red and the water stayed 
clear. So that was that. Verreaux 
must have made a mistake of 
some kind. Maybe he had been 
fooled by the juice of accidentally 
squeezed red berries. 

l/IORE than four decades had 
to pass until somebody came 
forward to defend Verreaux. 
Gambia was a British colony by 
then, with a military garrison, 
and the garrison had a medical 
staff. One of the members of that 
staff was a Dr. Hinde, who kept 
touracos in a large open air en- 
closure. And Dr. Hinde reported, 
in 1865, that his touracos, after a 
bath, stained old newspapers red 
when they 'sat down on them to 
dry. Not only did they stain the 
papers, Dr. Hinde could actually 
observe the loss of color and 
wrote that “the birds nearly 
washed themselves white in water 
left for them to drink.” 

Since this was not a chance ob- 
servation under difficult circum- 
stances, but something that had 
been seen at leisure and repeated- 
ly, the fact itself could not longer 
be doubted. An English chemist 
by the name of A. H. Church 
decided to go after the mystery 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 




and came up with a detailed re- 
search report that was published 
in the Proceedings .of the Royal 
Society in 1869. 

Church had first washed the 
feathers with alcohol to remove 
any oil or fat that might cling to 
them. Then he tested the pig- 
ment of the feathers for solubility 
and quickly found that it dis- 
solved in soap water. He tried 
ammonia and caustic soda — they 
both worked. 

Proceeding with caustic soda, 
he, accumulated a large quantity 
of reddish solution and then pre- 
cipitated the pigment by means 
of hydrochloric acid. The precipi- 
tate was then washed once more 
with alcohol (in which it did not 

87 



dissolve) to remove impurities 
that might'be present. The result 
of all this was a flaky powder of 
crimson color which Church then 
analyzed. 

It turned out to be a copper 
compound; its name became tou- 
racine. And touracine, as had 
been demonstrated under strict 
laboratory conditions, was easily 
soluble in any alkaline liquid. 

Church’s report was most sat- 
isfactory to a chemist, but the 
naturalists were not happy with 
ft. All right, you could dissolve 
touracine with the aid of soap or 
alkali in the laboratory. But it 
did not rain soap suds in south- 
ern Africa. It had also been dem- 
onstrated that neither rain water, 
nor distilled water, nor tap water 
dissolved any touracine. Yet Ver- 
reaux' touracos had dripped red 
in the rain. And Dr. Hinde’s tou- 
racos had washed most of the 
touracine out of their red feathers 
with their drinking water. 

Zoological handbooks fisted 
tfee observed facts without offer- 
ing any explanation. Apparently 
there wasn’t any. Long after 
Church’s careful chemical work, 
in about 1925, a German biolo- 
gist, Dr. logo Krumbiegel, de- 
cided that the purpose of a 
anystery it it* solution. He read 
everything that had been reported 
•bout the touracc and the beha- 
jpinr of the copper compound in 
Ite red leathers, and he thought 



that he found a hint in Church’s 
report. 

It said that “ordinary soap, or 
ammonia or caustic soda or any 
other alkali “tested” made the 
touracine dissolve. Of all the 
things mentioned, only ammonir 
was a possibility in the forest 
and plains of southern Africa. 1 
does occur in Nature in trace: 
The problem was whether trace* 
were enough. 

ly'RUMBIEGEL went to work 
systematically, beginning wit 
distilled water. No result. Taj 
water was next, then boiling wa 
ter, both distilled and tap. Nega- 
tive. He weighed some feather' 
down with wire and immerse- 
them in water for a week. Still 
negative. Then ammonia, house- 
hold strength of a few parts in m 
hundred. Positive, as expected. 
Then ammonia diluted to two 
parts in a thousand. Still positive 
— strongly positive, in fact. Dr. 
Krumbiegel thinned the solution 
some more. When he reached « 
“concentration” of one part c»f 
ammonia in two million parts of 
water, he stopped. The result was 
still positive and a one-to-two- 
million ratio certainly was a 
“trace.” 

Ammonia, then, was the an- 
swer. Verreaux’s touracos had 
been in the underbrush close to 
the ground, and rain water which 
drips from branch to branch is 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sure to pick up some ammonia. 
Not much — an expert estimate 
said “around one part in a mil- 
lion” — but • Dr. Krumbiegel had 
just demonstrated to himself that 
one part in two million was 
enough. And Dr. Hinde’s toura- 
cos probably had had several 
parts in a thousand in their drink- 
ing water, for caged birds don’t 
worry where their droppings land. 
They don’t know, naturally, that 
their droppings contain ammonia. 

Once a teuraco has lost the 
touracine of its red feathers, it 
stays discolored until the next 
moulting period, when brightly 
colored new feathers begin to 
sprout. As far as the body chem- 
istry of the bird is concerned, the 
whole is a way of ridding the body 
of a copper compound which 
would be poisonous to the or- 
ganism if it were not changed into 
the non-toxic touracine. Normal- 
ly it would be lost along with the 
feathers during the next moult. 
But because it happens to be 
soluble, it can be lost before the 
next moult. 

That purely incidental fact 
created the zoological riddle that 
ended up in making the touraco 
famous as the only bird that isn’t 
color-fast.

A FTER my pieee about the

(one yard added) appeared, 1 
have been asked what value for 
“pi” should be used to calculate 
the distance precisely. Well, that 
depends, of course, on the degree 
of precision you want. The ■■cus- 
tomary value of 3.1416 is 
perfectly fine for all but astro- 
nomical calculations. To fourteen 
places the value is: 

3. 1J1 59265358979 
and that is good enough to obtain 
the circumference of a circle the 
size of the equator to one-mil- 
lionth of an inch. 

T HE way to remember pi to 
fourteen places is to memorize 
the sentence : “How I want »

drink, alcoholic, of course, after 
the heavy chapters involving 
quantum mechanics.” It not only 
works, it probably is by a famous 
author, Sir James Jeans. At least 
others have credited him with it, 
though he himself never claimed 
authorship. 

Pi has been calculated to sev- 
eral hundred decimal places. In 
1873, the British mathematician 
William Shanks published the 
figures for 707 places, but it later 
turned out that he made a mis- 
take at about the 510th place. 
Nowadays, electronic calculators

would want them to, but there is 
really no practical reason for do-

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Is it possible that there are dark 
or black planets ip our solar sys- 
tem and, if so, how would astron- 
omers detect suc(i a planet? 

Mildred Moore 
116 William Street 
Hightstown, N. J. 

It is quite certain that there 
Is no black planet of a size 
worth mentioning in our solar 
system, at least not inside the 
orbit of Uranus. If a planet 
really absorbed all the light 
from the Sun that falls upon it, 
it would still betray its presence 
by its gravitational action. The 
movements of the other known 
planets near to it would be dif- 
ferent. In fact, for a long time 
both Neptune and Pluto, al- 
though not invisible, played the 
role of such “black planets.” 
They were detected by their in- 
flnenee on the orbits of the 
planets near diem. 

On January 27, 1950, a /apa- 
mme astronomer saw an explosion 
mm Mars. Do you know the cause 
*t it?

lasted for some time. But.it did :|| 
not. A number of astronomers, M 
prompted by the report from | 
Japan, looked for it and failed I 
to see it. It is probable, there- 
fore, that what the Japanese as- 
tronomer saw was the impact 
of a large meteorite. Since Mars 
is close to the Asteroid Belt, it 
should be hit by considerable 
chunks of matter much more 
frequently than Earth’s. In the 
last case of that kind on Earth 
(Eastern Siberia in # 1947), an 
enormous column of smoke 
and dust formed immediately 
after impact, but it lasted less 
than twelve hours. The “explo- 
sion” on Mars was probably the 
same thing. 

Could you explain to me why 
exactly does a Mdbius Strip have 
only one side? Secondly, are there

First: yes, there Is such a 



9ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thing as a Klein’s Bottle. 1 am 
not sure whether I should also 
say that there is a Tesseract, for 
a Klein’s Bottle can actually be 
built, while a Tesseract can only 
be represented. But let’s begin 
with the Mobius Strip and a 
mention of the branch of math- 
ematics to which it belongs, 
namely analysis situ, or topol- 
ogy, also called rubber sheet 
geometry, in descending line of 
dignity. 

Take a sheet of paper and 
make a few crosses at random, 
on both sides. Those crosses 
you can connect by straight or 
wavy lines without going over 
an edge are obviously on the 
same side of the paper. If you 
paste a strip of paper together 
so that it forms a cylinder, you 
l^nd that your crosses are either 
on the outside of the cylinder 
or on the inside. But if, in past- 
ing, you give it the Mobius half- 
twist, you’ll fjmd that you can 
connect them all. Therefore, it 
has only one side. 

For your amusement, draw 
the centerline and then cut 
carefully along the centerline. 
The result will puzzle you no 
end. 

Similarly, Klein’s Bottle, 
though obviously a solid body, 
has only one side. If you want' 
to make one, use something 
that ean he shaped easily, for 
example self-setting clay. (No

pattern on flat paper is pos- 
sible. ) 

While the Strip and the Bot- 
tle actually exist, the Tesseract 
is merely a concept, arrived at 
by the following reasoning: 
here we have a one-dimensional 
line a. Four such lines form a 
two-dimensional square, « 2 , 
which is bounded by four lines, 
and has 4 vertices (corners). 
Four such squares .form the 
three-dimensional cube, « 8 , 
which is bounded by six 
squares, has 12 edges and 4 
vertices. 

The four-dimensional cube, 
called Hypercube or Tesseract, 
would be mathematically de- 
scribed as a 4 and we can slate 
that it should be bounded by 8 
cubes, have 16 vertices, 24 
faces and 32 edges. But since 
it is supposed to be four-dimen- 
sional, we obviously can't make 
one. 

"/ must take exception to your 
statement in the June 1952 issue 
ol GALAXy that the chances of 
finding intelligent life on other 
planets are excellent. You have 
no doubt read du Douy’s Human 
Destiny; it contains a calculation 
that the probability of even a 
simple protein molecule’s forma- 
tion on an Earthlike planet — that 
is> this one — is approx, one in 
16 821 . Let’s say that he has made 
• slight error on the order of 



91 



jq»°o_ That would stilt leave the 
probability oi a protein mole- 
cule's appearance on Earth about 
t>ne in 10 21 . For the sake of sim- 
plicity in calculation, assume that 
our galaxy contains 10 billion 
Earthlike planets; the chance of 
finding life would still be- only one 
in 10 11 , a rather insignificant 
probability. To assume thtit life 
will appear on a planet, or even 
one per cent of the planets, where 
conditions are similar to those on 
Earth, is therefore not quite rea- 
sonable. 

W. E. Miller 
64 Norris Avenue 
Haworth, N. J. 

I have read Human Destiny 
and I count the time spent with 
that book as one of the more 
or less lost weekends of my life 
— loss of time being the most 
evident result in the battle be- 
tween reason and mysticism. 

If the probability of the 
formation of a protein mole- 
cule were one in 10 821 as du 
Nouy decreed, or merely one 
in 10 21 as you find more likely, 
the conclusion would be inev- 
itable that it didn’t happen at 
all. Not even on Earth, Those 
botanical parks, zoological gar- 
dens, aquaria and mass meet- 
ings are just illusions. 

Seriously, du Nouy’s calcu- 
lation is completely shattered 
by the existence of plant life 



on Mars, something that is 
generally accepted as a result 
©f observational evidence. 
Speaking of Earth alone, it 
could be asserted that the gera- 
niums and the oysters, the ca- 
nary birds and their keepers 
are not illusions; in short, that 
the fantastically low probabili- 
ty of the formation of a pro- 
tein molecule came true in 
this particular case which, 
therefore, had to be unique. 
But if you find that it came 
true on two planets in the same 
solar system, you either have 
to stretch credulity beyond its 
admittedly high elastic limit, 
or else you conclude that the 
original assertion must be 
wrong. 

It could be w/ong in two 
ways; either because it simply 
happens not to be true because 
the probability of tlie forma- 
tion of protein molecules under 
proper conditions is much high- 
er; or else it could be wrong 
because there is an additional 
factor which operates to invali- 
date the low probability. 

That additional factor was 
pointed out more than half a 
century ago by the great Swed- 
ish astrophysicist Svante Arr- 
henius. Arrhenius pointed out 
that the size of the spores of 
most bacteria is such that for 
them the light pressure of a 
nearby star is stronger than 



92 SAL AX Y SCIENCE FICTION 



% 



tlie gravitation of the same star. 
Hence they could drift through 
space in opposition to gravita- 
tional fields. 

Arrhenius also pointed out 
that such spores could stand 
free space conditions and that, 
just under these conditions, 
their life processes would be 
slowed down to such an extent 
that they could stay alive for 
thousands of years. 

In that case, life had to orig- 
inate only once to spread 
through the whole Galaxy in 
time — and who could say that 
it had originated on Earth? 

Nor does it seem likely that 
the probability of protein mole- 
cule formation is actually so 
low. It has been shown in the 
laboratory that under the in- 
fluence of ultra-violet light 
from the Sun, a number of 
very interesting compounds 
will form from nothing more 
exotic than water, carbon di- 
oxide and ammonia. Some of 
these compounds are sugars. 
Others might very well be 
building blocks of proteins, for 
they came in various stages of 
complexity. 



Actually, these substances are 
quickly destroyed by micro- 
organisms. But if there are no 
micro-organisms yet, these 
simpler substances may well 
continue building up — into mi- 
cro-organisms. 

Since I place du Nouy’s con- 
clusions with those that 
“proved” the steamship, air- 
plane and rocket couldn’t work, 

I still maintain that the prob- 
ability of life on other planets 
is high.

, , . but a clumsy or reckless farmer 

can turn any green planet into a dust bowfP 



tic with you if your own ill-ad- 
vised actions were not so largely 
responsible for this situation,” He 
checked his young listener’s half- 
uttered protest. “Oh, I realize 
that youngsters have to learn, 
and experiment is the only source 
of knowledge: but why not use 
the results of other people’s ex- 
periments? This sort of thing has 
happened before, I think you’ll 
find.” 

“I didn’t know.” The answer 
was sullen despite the grudging 
respect. “How was I supposed 
to?" 

“Did you get an education or 
not?” There was some heat in the 
query, “I can’t imagine what the 
primary teachers do these days. 
Even though you are so young, 
I understood that you had some 
qualifications and even a bit of 
promise in agriculture. That’s 
why I thought you could be 
trusted without supervision for a 
few years. Am I to assume that 
you became dissatisfied with the 
yield of this farm?” 

' “Of course. Why else study 
agriculture?” 

“Until you can answer that for 
yourself, I won’t try to. Tell me 
in detail what you did. Did you 
try to step up the output of the 
central radiator?” 

“What do you think I am?” 
The younger being’s indignation 
flared abruptly. 

The other remained calm and 



exhibited faint traces of amuse- 
ment, permitting the feeling to 
show in his answer rather more 
plainly than was stricly tactful. 

“Don’t boil your crust off. You 
might not be able to spare it 
next time you go in to harvest. 
People still do try the stunt I 
mentioned, you know. Every now 
and then it works for someone 
after a fashion, so the rest feel it’s 
still worth trying. If it wasn’t 
that, just what did you do? 
You’re missing a culture unit, if 
I remember this solar system cor- 
rectly.” 

T HE student took a moment to 
find just the right words. “One 
of the lots seemed to be practi- 
cally ideal. When it first solidi- 
fied, it was just far enough from 
the radiator and just large 
enough to retain a thin surface 
film of light elements; and it 
responded beautifully to cultur- 
ing with water-base growths. On 
the colder ones, by the way, I had 
good luck with ammonia cul- 
tures.” 

“Quite possible, in that sort of 
bed. I noticed a couple of them 
were bare, though. Was that an- 
other result of this experiment 
of yours?” 

“Indirectly, yes.” The young 
farmer looked a trifle apprehen- 
sive. “There was another plot, a 
good deal farther out and colder 
than my ideal one. But it was too

t 

it for ammonia growths and too 
all to furnish the pressure they 
seem to need — at least the ones 
I’m familiar with.” The addition 
‘‘ was made hastily. 

■ “I judged that it should have 
a good supply of food elements, 
cooling where it did; and since 
it wasn't doing well where it was, 
I thought it would be a good idea 
to move it farther in.” 



The listener’s manner lost some 
of its amused aspect. 

“Just how did you decide to go 
about that? The energy involved 
would have demanded several 
times the mass of your own body, 
even with total conversion— 
which I can’t believe you’ve mas- 
tered.” 

“I don’t suppose I have. It 
seemed to me that the unit it- 
self could furnish the mass with- 
out serious loss, though.” 

“I see.” The comment was 



grim. “Go on.” 

“Well, I went in and set up 
a conversion reaction. I touched 
it off as well as I could on the 
forward side of the unit, though 
that was a little hard to arrange 
-—the thing was spinning like 
mad, as most of them do. Maybe 
; that was the reason I let a little 
too much mass get involved, or 
j maybe the globe wasn’t as mas- 
sive as I had thought.” 

You mean you were uncer- 
tain of its mass? Is something 
Wrong with your perceptive fac- 



ulties as well as your judgment? 
Just how old are you, anyway?” 
“Fifteen.” The sullenness, 
which had began to depart from 
the youngster’s tone as he warm- 
ed to his narrative, returned in 
full strength. The questioner 
noted it and realized that he was 
not being as tactfut as he might 
be; but under the circumstances 
he felt entitled to a little emotion. 
“Fifteen years on what scale?” 
“Local — this furnace, around 
the mass-center of' the system.” 
“Hmph. Continue.” 

“Most of the sphere was vola- 
tilized, and most of what wasn’t 
was blown completely out of the 
system’s gravitational influence. 
The rest — well, it’s still circling 
the furnace in quite a wide var- 
iety of orbits but it’s not much 
good to anyone.” 

T HERE was a pause while the 
nearly useless outermost unit 
swung beneath the two speakers, 
then on to the far side of the 
glowing sphere of gas that held it 
with unbreakable fingers of grav- 
ity. The supervisor was not ac- 
tually boiling — that would be 
difficult even for a body com- 
posed largely of methane, oxygen, 
and similar solids when it is at 
a temperatui^ of about half a 
degree absolute — but his temper 
was simmering. After a moment 
he spoke again. 

“Let me get this straight. You 



sent a slave with a message that 
your farm had gotten out of hand 
and that you would like advice. 
Am I to understand that you 
spent so much time ruining one 
©f your units that some of the 
others developed culture varia- 
tions whose taste didn’t appeal 
to you? I'm afraid my sympathy 
grows rapidly less.” 

"It’s not that I don’t like the 
stuff ; it’s that I can’t eat it.” The 
youngster must have been angry, 
too; there was no other imagin- 
able reason why he should have 
made a statement at once so true 
in fact and so misleading in im- 
plication. The superintendent, 
swallowing the implication whole, 
permitted the remains of his tem- 
per to evaporate completely. 

"You can’t eat it? That is 
really too bad. Pardon me while I 
go to sample some of this repul- 
sive chemical — or perhaps you 
would like to come along and 
show me what you have been 
eating. There is hardly enough 
drift in this area to support you, 
particularly with a decent- sized 
crew of slaves. What have you 
been feeding them? Perhaps you 
ought to let someone else take 
over this farm and get yourself a 
research job out in one of the 
drift clouds, soaking up your 
nourishment from a haze of free 
atoms ten parsecs across for a few 
years. You youngsters!” 

"I’ve been eating -from the am- 



monia units. So have the slaves." 

“Vei;x well, then I shall look 
over your water culture, which by 
elimination must be the one that’s 
been giving trouble. On second 
thought, you needn’t come along. 
It’s the third plot from the fur- 
nace. I can find my way.” He 
moved off abruptly, not even 
waiting for an answer. 

And the student, with no slight- 
est shadow of an excuse, simply 
because of his own childish loss 
of temper, let him go without a 
word of warning. 

It might, of course, have made 
no difference if he had spoken. 
The superintendent was annoyed, 
too, and might understandably 
have chosen to ignore his junior. 
His attention, as he permitted 
himself to fall toward the central 
radiator, was divided between his 
own irritation and the condition 
of the various plots. Only gradu- 
ally did the latter feeling pre- 
dominate. 

H E had to admit the outer- 
most was too cold for much 
chemical action except actual life 
processes which were too slow to 
be useful. The fact that the 
youngster he had left above had * 
induced anything at all to grow 
there was at least one point to 
his credit. It swung past only 
once while he was falling by its 
orbit. Though his gravity- given 
speed was slow, its ■ speed was 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



iftlower— and 'it had farther to go. 
Pr The next * two . he had noted 
readier were bare of useful 
[ growths. He remembered now 
t that the student had admitted 
k- this fact to be an indirect result 
of his experiment. The superin- 
f tendent could not see the con- 
i’ rieetion. The plots themselves, on 
l closer inspection, seemed physi- 

■ cally undamaged, and the student 
j;' himself could not possibly have 
p eaten them both clean, no matter 
| what his hunger. Of course, a 
;■ crowd of slaves might — but he 

• 'was not going to accuse anybody 

• yet of letting slaves get that far 
‘ out from under control. They 

■ Were not even allowed to ap- 
f proach a culture plot in person, 

. being fed from its produce by 
I- their master. 

The plots themselves were 
' r large bodies, though not the larg- 
l est in the system, with their solid 
{ bulks veiled under mile after 
kmile of hydrogen compounds. The 
superintendent’s senses probed in 
| vain for the enormously complex 
| compounds that were the pre- 
I'ferred food of his kind. Several 
jlmuch smaller bodies ware gravi- 
jr-tating about each of these plots, 
tjbut none was large enough to 
p'hold the light elements in the 
Eliquid or gaseous form necessary 
tfor food culture. 

|, The next unit had. the merit of 
interesting appearance, if noth- 
png else. In addition to the more 



or less standard quota of bodies 
circling it, it possessed a regular 
halo of minute particles traveling 
in a solidly interwoven maze of 
orbits just outside the atmos- 
phere. On the surface, and even 
in the atmosphere itself, its cul- 
tures were flourishing. The super- 
intendent paused to take a 
sample, and had to admit that 
once again the youngster had not 
done too badly. 

His temper cooling, he rode the 
farm plot most of the way around 
its orbit, taking an occasional 
taste and growing calmer by the 
moment. By the time he left the 
limits of his atmosphere, he was 
almost his normal self. 

This, however, did not last 
long enough even for him to get 
rid of the globe’s orbital speed, 
to 'say nothing of resuming his 
drop toward the Sun. He had 
slanted some distance inward and 
fallen well behind the ringed 
sphere when his attention was 
drawn to another, much smaller 
object well to one side of his line 
of flight. 

Physically, there was little re- 
markable about it. It was lCss 
massive even than his own body,, 
though a short period of obser- 
vation disclosed that it was in 
an orbit about the central fur- 
nace, just as the farm plots were. 
Sometimes its outline was clear, 
at others it blurred oddly. Its 
brightness flickered in an appar- 




ently meaningless pattern. Mere- 
ly on its physical description, 
there was nothing remarkable 
about it, but it seized and held 
the superintendent’s puzzled at- 
tention. Off his planned course 
though it was, he swung toward 
it, wondering. The student had 
mentioned no friends or co- 
workers — 

Gradually, details grew clearer 
and the superintendent’s feelings 
grew grimmer. He did not like to 
believe what he saw, but the evi- 
dence was crowding in. 

“Help! Please help! Master!” 

T HE bubble of horror burst, 
and one of anger grew in its 
place. Not one of his own kind, 
injured or dying and an object 
of terror and revulsion thereby; 

Mt 



this thing was a slave. A slave, 
moreover, well within the limits 
of the farm, where it had no 
business to be without supervi- 
sion; a slave who dared call on 
him for help! 

“What are you doing here?” 
The superintendent sent the ques- 1 
tion crackling along a tight beam | 
toward the apparently helpless | 
creature. “Did you enter this re- ’ 
gion without orders?” 

“No, Master. I was . or- 
dered,” 

“By whom? What happened to 
you? Speak more clearly!” j

mgs, he realized that help must 
be given if he were to learn any- 
thing. Conquering a distinct feel- 
ing of repugnance, he moved up 
beside the slave to investigate its 
injuries. He expected, naturally, 
to find the visible results of a 
thorough ion-lashing, that being 
the principal occupational hazard 
faced by the slaves; but what he 
actually saw almost made him 
forget his anger. 

The unfortunate creature’s 
outer crust was pitted — dotted 
and cratered with a pattern of 
circular holes which resembled 
nothing the superintendent had 
ever encountered. He knew the 
long, shallow scars of an ion- 
lashing and the broad, smoothed 
areas which showed on the crust 
of one of his people when close 
exposure to a sun had boiled away 
portions of his mass. These 
marks, however, looked almost 
as though the slave had been ex- 
posed to a pelting by granules of 
Solid matter! 

A ridiculous thought, of course. 
The stupidest slave could detect 
and avoid the occasional bits of 
rock and metal which were en- 
countered in the interstellar void. 
After all, they had the same sen- 
sory equipment and physical 
powers as the masters. An un- 
prejudiced judge might even have 
said they were of the same spe- 
cies as the masters. 

Whatever had caused the crea- 



ture’s injury, there was little that 
could be done for it. Grudgingly, 
inspired far more by curiosity 
than by sympathy, the superin- 
tendent did that little, supplying 
hydrocarbons and other organic 
matter lately skimmed from the 
ringed planet. 

Food, however, was not enough. 
Bits of extraneous metal were 
imbedded in its body, altering 
the precise pattern of charged 
metal nodes that spelled life to 
these beings. Some of its own 
field nodes had apparently been 
chipped or blown away, and oth- 
ers were discharged. The crea- 
ture’s body was only a fraction 
of its normal size — the regular 
reserve of “food" compounds that 
ordinarily made up so much of 
even a slave’s bulk had long since 
been consumed or had evapo- 
rated. 

There was no doubt that it 
was dying. But there was some 
chance that it might gain strength 
enough to impart information if 
it were fed. It was — sparingly, of 
course. 

“No sense wasting food on a 
slave that’s about to die,” the 
superintendent explained without 
brutality. 

“Certainly not. Master,” the 
slave agreed without resentment. 

“WfHAT happened to you?”

ed. The slave was in no condition

to' be coherent; but a lifetime of 
conditioning, brought some order 
to its agony-dazed mind, and it 
answered. 

“I was ordered to the inner 
plots — to harvest.” The word- 
symbols came haltingly, but with 
sufficient clarity to be unmistak- 
able, shocking as their implica- 
tion was. 

So the student had trusted 
slaves near a food supply! Per- 
haps that accounted for the two 
stripped planets. 

“You went to harvest when a 
young fool like this orders it?” 

“He was a master, and he gave 
the order. Many of us went; many 
of us have been going for years — 
and seldom returning. We did not 
wish it, Master, but he ordered it. 
What could we do?” 

“You could have asked the first 
superintendent who came here 
whether it was better to disobey 
a Prime Order or a young mas- 
ter.” 

“You are the first to come. 
Master, as far as I know. And 
the young master said we were 
not to speak of this order to any- 
one. It is only because you com- 
mand me to speak that I do so 
now — that and the fact that there 
is little more that he coqld do 
to me, anyway.” 

The overseer ignored the point- 
ed closing sentence. “You say 
many of you have been ordered 
to do this, but few have returned 



from the errand? What happened 
to them? What happened to 
you?” 

“They die. I did not know 
how; now I suppose it must be — • 
this way.” 

There was a pause, and the 
supervisor was moved to sarcasm. 
“I suppose they are struck by 
meteoric particles, as you seem 
to have been. Do slaves absorb 
personal characteristics such as 
stupidity from their masters? 
Could you not dodge the me- 
teors?” 

“No, not all of them. The re- 
gion near the central furnace has 
more of such matter than any 
other place 1 have ever seen. 
Some pieces are iron, some are of 
other matter; but they cannot be 
avoided. They strike too hard. 
They cannot be absorbed in nor- 
mal fashion, but simply boil off 
one’s body material into space. 
The shock is so tremendous that 
I, at least, could do nothing to- 
ward recovering the material un- 
til it had dissipated beyond hope 
of salvage. That is the reason so 
much of my mass is gone; it was 
not merely starvation. 

“Some of the other slaves did 
better than I — as I said, some of 
them have survived — but others 
did much worse. They would dive 
in toward the furnace, and their 
bodies would come falling back 
out in just about the shape I am.” 

“And still he sends his slaves

fin to harvest?" 

| “Yes. We did not do too badly, 
P actually, on the largest plots ; but 
| then he got interested in the oth- 
ers farther in. After all, they’re 
hotter. He ventured in himself 
1 almost to the orbit of the plot 
that was destroyed — did you 
l know that? — but came out very 
quickly and sent us on all such 
f journeys thereafter. 

“We — or, rather, those who pre- 
; ceded me — cleaned off the next 
inner plot, the fourth from the 
central furnace, fairly well, 
though the loss of slaves was high. 
Then he wanted to start on the 
third. I was one of the first to 
work on this project. 

; “I did not expect to live, of 
course, after what I had heard 
' from the others; but the order 
' came, and I let myself fall toward 
i the sun. My orbit passed close to 
jj. the greatest of the plots, which 
l the master has been harvesting 
; himself, and I hoped to strengthen 
• myself with a little food from it 
| as I passed.” 

*T^HAT confession showed how 
■ certain the slave felt of his 
if own imminent death, as well as 
the state of demoralization into 
I which the student’s activities had 
Ipermitted his servitors to fall. 

I “But I did not dare take any 
pood when the time came,” the 
pslave went on feebly. “As I passed 
through the region where the de- 
li AlO 

I 



stroyed plot had been, drifting 
particles began to grow more nu- 
merous. At first there would be 
an occasional bit of stone or iron, 
which I could dodge easily. Then 
they came in twos and threes, 
and sometimes I would have to 
change an escape curve in mid- 
maneuver. Then they came in 
dozens and clusters, and at last 
I could avoid them no longer. I 
was struck several times in rapid 
succession. 

“For a moment I almost turned 
back — I had never dreamed that 
anything could feel like that — 
and then I remembered the order 
and went on. And I was struck 
again, and again, and each time 
the order faded in my mind. I 
reached the orbit of the fourth 
planet, crossed it — and turned 
out again. It didn’t seem to help; 
I Was still being pelted. For a 
time I must have almost lost ori- 
entation; but at last I won out 
to a place near the orbit of the 
giant planet. That was where I 
remembered the order again. 

“I had never disobeyed a mas- 
ter before, and I didn’t know what 
to do, or say, or think. I’d start 
back toward the Sun, and re- 
member what had happened, and 
come back out. Then I’d remem- 
ber the master, and head in again. 
I didn’t dare go out in the cold 
where he would be waiting. I 
didn’t dare dive back into that 
storm of rock and metal from 

103 



the old fifth planet. But I had to 
do something. I couldn’t float by 
the orbit of the Giant Planet for- 
ever. He would find me there 
sooner or later, and that would be 
worse than if 1 had come out to 
him. I had to think,” * 

That word struck the superin- 
tendent like a shock. The very 
idea of a slave’s thinking — mak- 
ing a decision for himself con- 
cerning an action he was to 
perform — was repugnant to a 
member of the dominant race. 
They preferred to think of their 
slaves as mindless creatures rely- 
ing on their masters for the 
necessities of existence — a com- 
forting fiction that had been 
maintained for so many rota- 
tions of the Galaxy that its orig- 
inators had come to believe it 
themselves. He had suspected 
that this particular slave must be 
an unusual specimen in many 
ways; now he was sure of it. 

It was this that kept him silent 
while the creature paused, vis- 
ibly collected its waning energies, 
and resumed the tale. 

‘T found what I thought was 
the answer at last. Since the tre- 
mendous number of particles 
must have come from the farm 
that had been blown up, it 
seemed likely that their orbits 
would be more or less controlled 
by that and would have at least 
a slight family resemblance. If I 
were to take up a powered, nearly 



elliptical path through that re- 
gion, matching velocities wit) 
most of them instead of falling 
in a practically parabolic orbr 
across their path, I should b« 
able to avoid the worst of the 
blows.” 

W EAKLY, the shattered crea- 
ture shuddered and paused 
mustering strength to continue 
“I had about made up my mind 
to try this when I detected ar» 
other slave inbound,” it went or 
“and it occurred to me that tw< 
would be better than one. If on 
died, at least the other coul 
learn from what had happened, 
caught’ him easily since he we; 
in free fall and explained the 
idea. He seemed willing to foi 
low any suggestion, not thinkir. 
for himself at all, so he wer 
with me. 

“For a while it worked. We ge t 
inside the orbit of the fourth 
planet without being hit more 
than a few times each — that we? 
harder on me than on him, be - 
cause I’d already been hurt quite 
a lot on the first trip. Into that 
level, a great deal of the wreck- 
age is formed of quite large par- 
ticles, anyway; it’s easy to see 
and avoid. Farther in, though, 
where most of the heavy stuff 
either never went or was cleared 
out by collision with the inner 
planets in a few million of their 
revolutions, there was much more

extremely fine stuff. It actually 
seems to increase in concentra- 
tion near the sun. Maybe radia- 
tion pressure has something to 
do with it. 

“Anyway, we began to take a 
bad beating again. It was a little 
better than before. My idea must 
have had something to it, but it 
still wasn’t good. The other slave 
wasn’t used to it, but it 
still wasn’t good. The other slave 
wasn’t used to it, either, and lost 
control of himself just as I had. 
We were almost to the third farm 
plot then, but he must have gone 
completely blind from pain. He 
apparently never sensed the food 
so near by — that plot is incred- 
ibly ridh. 

“He went blundering squarely 
into another, useless plot that ac- 
companies the third one in its 
orbit; an object too small to hold 
culture material in that temper- 
ature range, though still several 
hundred times the diameter of 
my body or his. He rammed it 
hard, and- the energy involved in 
matching velocities was more 
than enough to volatilize his mass 
completely. The object was pret- 
ty well scarred with impact cra- 
ters, but he made one of the 
neatest. 

“I was close enough then to 
the third planet to start harvest- 
ing — at least, I Would have been 
under normal circumstances. I 
tried, but couldn’t concentrate on 



H Aid 



one course- of action long enough. 
The bombardment was endless. 
There are simply no words to 
describe what it was like. I was 
not twenty of its own diameters 
■from, the most amazingly rich 
farm plot I have ever seen, and 
was not able to touch a bit of it! 

“It had been so long since it 
was harvested that substances 
completely strange to me had de- 
veloped in its surface layers. 
There were carbohydrates, of 
course, and light-element oxides 
and carbonates which anyone 
would expect; but there were 
proteins more fantastically com- 
plex than anyone could well im- 
agine. Their emanations nearly 
drove me wild. They must have 
been building up and breaking 
down at incredible speed at that 
temperature — I had quite an at- 
mosphere out, as a result of boil- 
ing off surface matter to use up 
incoming radiant energy — and 
they had evolved t-o ari unheard- 
of degree. And I couldn’t get a 
taste! 

“I could sense them, though, 
and in spite of the pain of the 
meteor bombardment, I stayed 
near the planet, vacillating as I 
had done before, for a couple of 
hundred of its trips around the 
Sun. That may seem like a short 
time, but it was long enough to 
ruin my body past saving. It was 
only when my senses began to 
fail that I was able to turn away 

106 



from it and fight my way out 
this far. I just managed to get 
info a stable orbit that would 
keep me clear of that hellish halo 
of planet fragments, and every 
now and then I succeeded in* 
mustering enough energy to call 
for help, but I knew it was use- 
less. Even had you come much 
sooner, it would still have been 
too late for me. 

“I live to warn you, however. 
Do not go within the orbit ot the 
old fifth planet! Do not even 
look within it, for if you sense 
what lies on that unharvested 
third world, you will be drawn 
to your doom as surely as I was 
ordered to mine!” 

T HE slave fell silent, and the 
superintendent pondered its 
tale as they drifted on about the 
Sun. He Could not, offhand, think 
of any adequate punishment for 
the student whose recklessness 
had brought about this state of 
affairs. The mere cruelty of or- 
dering endless crowds of slaves 
to nearly certain death did not 
affect him particularly; but the 
waste of it did, very much. To 
him the thought of hundreds of 
lifeless bodies drifting endlessly 
about the Sun, boiling off a little 
more of their masses with each 
perihelion passage until nothing 
was left but a loose collection of 
high melting-point pebbles, was 
a painful picture of economic loss. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



!*hc fact that the best farm plot 
in the system had apparently be- 
come unattainable was also to be 
^considered, and the driving of at 
least one slave to the extreme of 
'thinking for himself was not to 
be ignored. 

. Of course, everything should be 
(checked before confronting the 
! student with such charges. Only 
the last, after all, could be con- 
sidered as yet a matter of ob- 
jective knowledge, 

t The overseer moved abruptly 
pway from the slave — Sunward. 
|Fhe dying creature, seeing him 
■depart, called once more for aid, 
jand was silenced instantly and 
permanently by a slashing beam 
•Of ions. For an instant the over- 
seer regretted the impulsive act — 
«ot from gratitude for the warn- 
ing, to which he attached little 
height and which was part of a 
slave s duty, but simply because 
t was impulsive rather than rea- 
ioned. But then he reflected that 
he creature could probably not 
Save told much more anyway, 
■ven if it had survived until his 
feturn. 

He was in no hurry. He let the 
ravity of the central furnace 
faw him in to the orbit of the 
bant Planet, his senses covering 
fee half-billion-mile sphere of 
lace ahead where death was re- 
nted to lurk. 

At this range, all seemed in- 
Scuous. He watched the inner 




planets circling rapidly in their 
paths— even the giant one made 
most of a revolution during his 
fall — and noted that the slave had 
spoken the truth about a com- 
panion body to the third* planet. 
But space seemed otherwise 
empty. 

He did not completely abandon 
caution, however. What had 
proven fatal to slaves might be 
inconvenient or even dangerous to 
a master. - 

IJE stopped at the fifth planet’s 
orbit and began a more mi- 
nute examination of that suspi- 
cious volume of space. 

The small bodies were there, - 
all right. Thousands of them, 
even though he was not trying to 
detect anything less than a twen- 
tieth of his own diameter. They 
did show a rather vague prefer- 
ence for the orbit of the old fifth 
planet, as the slave had said. The 
greater number circled between 
the present fourth and fifth or- 
bits, at any rate. There seemed 
no reason why he could not match 
velocities well enough to keep out 
of trouble. Why, chance alone 
could be trusted to protect him 
from collision with a few thou- 
sand asteroids, when they were 
scattered through something like 
ten-to- the - twenty - fourth - power 
cubic miles of space! 

Still, there was little wisdom in 
going into possible danger with- 



107 



f 

owt a very sound reason. It would 
be well to judge from his present 
position if such reason existed. 
His finer senses could easily op- 
erate at the half billion miles that 
separated him from the farthest 
point of the third planet’s orbit. 
So, holding his position, he fo- 
cused his attention on the elusive 
farm plot in question. 

Being so close to the central 
furnace, it revolved rapidly. He 
faced somewhat the same prob- 
lem in examining it that a man 
would have trying to recognize a 
friend on a merry-go-round — as- 
suming that the friend were spin- 
ning in his seat like a top at the 
same time. 

It took the superintendent only 
a few revolutions of the body to 
adjust to this situation, however, 
and as details registered more 
and more clearly on his con- 
sciousness, he began to admit 
grudgingly that the slave had not 
exaggerated. 

The plot was fabulous! 

Substances for which he had 
no name abounded, impressing 
themselves on the analytical sense 
that was his equivalent of both 
taste and smell. Strange as they 
were, he could tell easily that; 
they were foods — packed with 
available energy and carrying 
fascinating taste potentialities, 



which simply never had a chance 
to evolve on the regularly har- 
vested worlds of the Galaxy. 

The overseer wondered whether 
it might not be worth while to let 
other plots run wild for a few 
years. His principal vice, by the 
standards of his people, was glut- 
tony; but the most ascetic of his 
species would have been tempted 
uncontrollably by that planet. 

He almost regretted the few 
tons of food he 'had taken on 
from the ringed planet — though 
he had, he told himself quickly, 
sacrificed much of that in help- 
ing the slave and would lose still 
more if he decided actually to 
penetrate into the high-tempera- 
ture zones near the Sun. 

Huge as his mass was, his 
normal temperature was so low 
that life processes went on at an 
incredibly slow pace. To him, 'a 
chemical reaction requiring only 
a few millennia to go to comple- 
tion was like a dynamite explo- 
sion. A few pounds of organic 
compounds would feed his miles - 
thick bulk . for many human 
lifetimes of high activity. 

In short, the slave had been 
quite right. 

A LMOST involuntarily, ra- 
tionalizing his appetite as he 
went, the superintendent permit- 
ted himself to drift into the

[assumed a parabolic, free-fall or- 
febit in the general plane of the sys- 
tem, with its perihelion point 
approximately tangent to the or- 
bit of the third planet. At this 
? distance from the Sun, the dif- 
ference between parabolic and 
circular velocities was not too 
great to permit him to detect 
Seven the tiniest particles in time 
to avoid them. That fact, of 
^course, changed as he fell sun- 
5 ward. 

Perhaps he had been counting 
on a will power naturally super- 
ior to that of the slave who had 
| warned him. If so, he had for- 
gotten the effects of an equally 
superior imagination. The pull 
of the third planet was correspon- 
dingly stronger and, watching the 
spinning globe, he was jarred out 
of an almost hypnotic trance by 
the first collision. It awakened 
him to the fact that his natural 
superiority to the slave race 
might not be sufficient to keep 
lim out of serious trouble. 

The space around him — he was 
low well inside the orbit of the 
burth planet — was literally 
irowded with grain-of-dust me- 
teors, each, as he had seen on the 
slave’s crust, able to blast out a 
'rater many times its own volume 
ft a living body. Individually, 
:hey were insignificant; collec- 
ivfely, they were deadly. 

: His attention abruptly wrench- 
d back to immediate problems 



of existence, the superintendent 
started to check his fall and veer- 
once more toward the safe, frozen 
emptiness of interstellar space. 
But the spell of the gourmet V 
paradise he had been watching 
was not that easily thrown off. 
For long moments, while the: 
planet circled its primary once 
and again, he hung poised, with- 
gluttony and physical anguish al- 
ternately gaining the upper hand- 
in a struggle for possession of his 
will. Probably he would have lost, 
alone; but his student did have a 
conscience. 

“Sir!” The voice came faintly 
but clearly to his mind. “Don’t 
stay! You mustn’t! I should 
never have let you come— but I 
was angry! I know I was a fool; 

I should have told you every- 
thing!” 

“I learned. It was my own 
fault.” The superintendent found 
it curiously difficult to speak. 
“I came of my own free will and 
I still think that plot is worth 
investigation.” 

“No! It’s not your own free 
will — no will could remain free 
after seeing what that planet has 
to offer, I knew it and expected 
you to die — but I couldn’t go 
through with it. Come, and 
quickly. I will help.” 

r T , HE student was in an orbit 

almost identical with that of 
the superintendent, though still

a good deal farther out. Perhaps 
it was the act of looking at him, 
which took his attention momen- 
tarily from the alluring object 
below, that made the older being 
waver. Whatever it was, the stu- 
dent perceived the break and 
profited by it. 

“Don’t even look at it again, 
sir. Look at me, and follow — or if 
you’d rather not look at me, look 
at that!” 

He indicated the direction 
plainly, and the dazed listener 
looked almost involuntarily. 

The thing he saw was recog- 
nizable enough. It consisted of 
a small nucleus which his senses 
automatically analyzed. It con- 
sisted of methane and other hy- 
drocarbons, some free oxygen, a 
few other light-element com -

pounds, and had nuggets of 
heavier elements scattered 
through it like raisins in a plum 
pudding. Around it for thousands 
of miles there extended a tenuous 
halo of the more volatile of its 
constituent compounds. The 
thing was moving away from the 
Sun in an elliptical orbit, showing 
no sign of intelligent control. A 
portion of its gaseous envelope 
was driven on ahead by the pres- 
sure of sunlight from below. 

It was a dead slave, but it 
could as easily have been a dead 
master. 

A' dead slave was nothing; but 
the thing that had killed it could 
do the fame to him. 

It was the first time, in his 
incredibly long life that the per- 
sonal possibility of death had 
struck home to him; and prob- 
ably nothing less than that fear 
could have saved his life. 

With the student close beside, 
he followed the weirdly glowing 
corpse out to the farthest point 
of its orbit; and as it started to 
fall back into the halo of death 
girdling that harmless-looking 
star, he pressed on out into the 
friendly darkness. 

Perhaps some day that third 
planet would be harvested; but 
it would not be by one of his 
kind — not, at least, until that 
guarding haze had been swept up 
by the planets that drifted 
through its protecting veil. 



I T was not a very good group* 
Wright reflected. That always 
seemed to be the case. When he 
had luck with observing weather, 
he had no one around to appreci- 
ate the things that could be seen. 
He cast a regretful glance toward 
the dome of the sixty-inch tele- 
scope, where a fellow candidate 
was taking another plate of his 
series, and wondered whether 
there were not some better way 
than part-time instructing to pay 
the expenses of a doctorate pro- 
gram. 

Still, the night was good. Most 
of the time in the latitude — 

“Mr. Wright! Is that a cloud 
or the Aurora?” 

“If you will stop to consider 
the present position of the Sun 
below the horizon,” he answered 
indirectly, “you will discover that 
the patch of light you are indicat- 
ing is directly opposite that 
point. It lies along the path of 
the Earth’s shadow, though, of 
course, well beyond it. It is called 
the Gegenschein and, like the 
Zodiacal Light, is not too com- 
monly visible at this latitude. 
We did see the Light some time 
ago, if you remember, oil an eve- 
ning when we started observing 
earlier. Actually, the Gegen- 
schein is a continuation of the 
luminous band we call the Zodia- 
cal Light. The latter can some- 
times be traced all the way 
around the sky to the point we

are now watching.” 

“Wtiat .causes them?” 

“The most reasonable assump- 
tion is that they are light reflec- 
ted from small, solid particles — - 
meteors. Apparently a eloud of 
such matter extends outward for 
some distance past the Earth’s 
orbit, though just how far, it is 
hard to say. It grows fainter with 
distance from the Sun, as would 
be expected, except for the patch 
we call the Gegenscheiri.” 

“Why the exception?” 

“I think one of you can answer 

that.” 

“Would it be for the same rea- 
son that the full Moon is so much 
more than twice as bright as 
either quarter? Simply because 
the particles are rough, and 
appear dark in most positions 
because of the shadows of ir- 
regularities on their own surfaces 
— shadows which disappear when 
the light is behind the observer?” 
“I think you will agree that 
that would account for it,” 
Wright said. “Evidently the me- 
teors are there, are large com- 
pared to wavelengths of visible 
light, and form a definite part of 
the Solar System, I believe it 
wa* once estimated that if the 
space inside the Earth’s orbit 
contained particles one milli- 
meter in diameter and five miles 
apart, they would reflect enough 
light to account for what we are 
observing. They might, of course. 



be smaller and more numerous. 
Only that amount of reflecting 
surface is necessary.” 

“You had me worried,” an- 
other voice broke in. “I’d been 
hearing for years that there 
would be little reason to fear j 
collision with meteors when we 
finally get a rocket out of the ' 
atmosphere. For a moment, I 
thought a cloud such as you were 
working up to would riddle any- 
thing that got into space. One 
pinhead every five miles isn’t 
so bad, though.” 

“There is a fairly good- chance 
of collision, I would say,” re- 
turned Wright, “but just what 
damage particles of that size 
would do, I am not sure. It seems 
rather likely that they would be 
volatilized by impact. How the j 
hull of a rocket would react, we i 
will have to find out by experi- 
ence. I wouldn’t mind taking the | 
risk myself. I think we can sum < 
up the greatest possibilities by ‘ 
saying that the meteoric content j 
of the Solar System has and will ; 
have nothing but nuisance value 1 
to the human race, whether or J 
not we ever leave our own plan- | 
et.” 1 

A streak of white fire arced | 
silently across the sky, putting j 
a fitting period to the subject. ; 

Wright wondered whether it J 
would appear on his friend’s pho- 
tographic plate.

Tree, 

Spare That Woodman 

By DAVE DRYFOOS 



The single thing to fear was 
fear — ghastly, walking fearl 



S TIFF with shock, Naomi 
Heckscher stood just inside 
the door to Cappy’s one- 
room cabin, where she’d hap- 
pened to be when her husband 



discovered the old man’s body, ' 
Her nearest neighbor — old 
Cappy — dead. After all his wire- 
pulling to get into the First 
Group, and his slaving to make a 




farm on this alien planet, dead in 
bed! 

Naomi’s mind circled franti- 
cally, contrasting her happy an- 
ticipations with this shocking ac- 
tuality. She’d come to call on a 
friend, she reminded herself, a 
beloved friend — round, white- 
haired, rosy- cheeked; lonely be- 
cause he’d recently become- a 
widower. To her little boy, Cappy 
was a combination Grandpa and 
Santa Claus; to herself, a sort of 
newly met Old Beau. 

Her mouth had been set for a 
sip of his home brew, her eyes 
had pictured the delight he’d take 
in and give to her little boy. 

She’d walked over with son and 
husband, expecting nothing more 
shocking than an ostentatiously 
Stolen kiss. She’d found a corpse. 
And to have let Cappy die alone, 
In this strange world . 

She and Ted could at least 
have been with him, if they’d 
known. 

But they’d been laughing and 
singing in their own cabin only 
a mile away, celebrating Richard’s 
fifth birthday. She’d been an- 
noyed when Cappy failed to show 
up with the present he’d prom- 
ised Richard. Annoyed — while the 
old man pulled a blanket over his 
head, turned his round face to 
the wall, and died. 

Watching compassionately, Na- 
omi was suddenly struck by the 
matter-of-fact way Ted examined 



the body. Ted wasn’t surprised. 1 
“Why did you tell Richard to I 
stay outside, just now?” she de- 
manded. “How did you know 
what we’d find here? And why 
didn’t you tell me, so I could 
keep Richard at home?” , 

She saw Ted start, scalded by 
the splash of her self-directed 
anger, saw him try to convert his 
wince into a shrug. 

“You insisted on coming,” he 
reminded her gently. “I couldn’t 
have kept you home without — 
without saying too much, worry- 
ing you — with the Earth-ship 
still a year away. Besides, 1 didn’t 
know for sure, till we saw the 
tree-things around the cabin.” 

The tree-things. The trees-that 
were-not. Gnarled blue trunk 
half-hidden by yellow leaf-needks 
stretching twenty feet into the 
sky. Something like the hoary a 
mountain hemlocks she and Ted 
had been forever photographing 
on their Sierra honeymoon, >. 
seven life-long years ago. 

Three of those tree-things had 
sjvayed over Cappy’s spring for 
a far longer time than Man had 
occupied this dreadful plane 
Until just now ... 

The three of them had topped 
the rise that hid Cappy’s farm 
from their own. Richard was run- 
ning ahead like a happily inquisi- 
tive puppy. Suddenly he’d 
stopped, pointing with a finger 
she distinctly recalled as needing

thorough soapy scrubbing. 

“Look, Mommie!” he'd said, 
“Gappy’ s trees have moved. 
They’re around the cabin, now.” 
He’d been interested, not sur- 
prised. In the past year, Mazda 
had become Richard's home ; only 
Earth could surprise him. 

But, Ted, come to think of it, 
had seemed withdrawn, his face 
a careful blank. And she? 

“Very pretty,” she’d said, and 
stuffed the fag-end of fear back 
into the jammed, untidy mental 
pigeon-hole she used for all un- 
pleasant thoughts. “Don’t run too 
far ahead, dear.” 

But now she had to know what 
Ted knew. 

“Tell me!” she said. 

“These tree-things — ” 

“There’ ve been other deaths! 
How many?” 

“Sixteen. But I didn’t want to 
tell you. Orders were to leave 
women and children home when 
we had that last Meeting, je- 
member.” 

“What did they say at the 
Meeting? Out with it, Ted!” 
“That — that the tree-things 
think!” 

“But that’s ridiculous!” 

“Well, unfortunately, no. Look, 
I’m not trying to tell you that 
terrestrial trees think, too, nor 
even that they have a nervous 
system. They don’t. But— well, 
on Earth, if you’ve ever touched 
a lighted match to the leaf of a 



sensitive plant like the '•mimosa, 
say — and I have — you’ve been 
struck by the speed with which 
other leaves close up and droop. 
I mean, sure, we know that the 
leaves droop because certain cells 
exude water and nearby leaves 
feel the heat of the match. But 
the others don’t, yet they droop, 
too. Nobody knows how it 
works . 

“But that’s just defensive!” 
“Sure. But that’s just on 
Earth!” 

“All right, dear. I won’t argue 
any more. But I still don’t under- 
stand. Go on about the Meeting.” 
“Well, they said these tree- 
things both create and respond to 
the patterned electrical impulses 
of the mind. It’s something like 
the way a doctor creates fantasies 
by applying a mild electric cur- 
rent to the right places on a pa- 
tient’s brain. In the year we’ve 
been here, the trees — or some of 
them — have learned to read from 
and transmit to our minds. The 
range, they say, is around fifty 
feet. But you have to be recep- 
tive — ” 

“Receptive?” 

“Fearful. That’s the condition. 
So I didn’t want to tell you be- 
cause you must not let yourself 
become afraid, Naomi, We’re 
clearing frees from the land, in 
certain areas. And it’s their 
planet, after all. Fear is their 
weapon and fear can kill!”

“Haven’t you ever heard of a Glass tinkled and crashed as

witch-doctor and is killed by 
magic? The savage is convinced, 
having seen or heard of other 
cases, that he can be killed. The 
witch-doctor sees to it he’s told 
he will be killed. And sometimes 
the savage actually dies — ” 

“From poison, I’ve always 
thought.” 

“The poison of fear. The phy- 
sical changes that accompany 
fear, magnified beyond belief by 
belief itself.” 

“But how in the world could 
all this have affected Gappy? He 
wasn’t a savage. And he was el- 
derly, Ted, A bad heart, maybe. 
A stroke. Anything.” 

“He passed his pre-flight phy- 
sical only a year ago. And — well, 
he lived all alone. He was careful 
not to let you see it, but I know 
he worried about these three trees 
on his place. And I know he got 
back from the Meeting in a wor- 
ried state of mind. Then, obvious- 
ly, the trees moved — grouped 
themselves around his cabin 
within easy range. But don’t be 
afraid of them, Naomi. So long 
as you’re not, they can’t hurt 
you. They’re not bothering us 
now.” 



“Richard! Richard!” 

Her child was not in sight. Nor 
within earshot, it seemed. 

“Richard Heckscher ! Where 
are you?” Sanity returned with 
the conventional primness. And it 
brought her answer. 

“Here I am, Mommie! Look- 
ut!” 

He was in a tree! He was fif- 
teen feet off the ground, high in- 
the branches of a tree-thing, 
swaying — 

For an instant, dread flowed 
through Naomi as if in her 
bloodstream and something was 
cutting off her breath. Then, as 
the hands over mouth and throat 
withdrew, she saw they were 
Ted’s. She let him drag her into 
the cabin and close the broken 
door. 

“Better not scare Richard,” he 
said quietly, shoving her gently 
into a chair. “He might fall.” 

Dumbly she caught her breath-, 
waiting for the bawling out she’d 
earned. 

But Ted said, “Richard keeps 
us safe. So long as we fear for 
him, and not ourselves — ” 

That was easy to do. Outside, 
she heard a piping call: “Look at 

A L A XY SCIENCE FICTION 



116 



me now, Mommie!" 

“Showing off !” she gasped. In a 
flashing vision, Richard was half 
boy, half vulture, flapping to the 
ground with a broken wing. 

“Here,”- said Ted, picking up 
a notebook that had been on the 
table. “Here’s Cappy’s present, A 
homemade picture book. Bait.” 

“Let me use it!” she said. 
“Richard may have seen I was 
scared just now.” 

Outside again, under the tree, 
she called, “Here’s Cappy’s pres- 
ent, Richard. He’s gone away and 
left it for you.” 

Would he notice how her voice 
had gone up half an octave, be- 
come flat and shrill? 

“I’m coming down,” Richard 
said. “Let me down, Tree.” 

He seemed to be struggling. 
The branches were cagelike. He 
was caught! 

Naomi’s struggle was with her 
voice. “How did you ever get up 
there?” she called. 

“The tree let me up, Mommie,” 
Richard explained solemnly, “but 
he won’t let me down!” He whim- 
pered a little. 

He must not become fright- 
ened! “You tell that tree you’ve 
got to come right down this in- 
stant!” she ordered. 

She leaned against the cabin 
for support. Ted came out and 
slipped his arm around her. 

“Break off a few leaves, 
Richard,” he suggested. “That’ll 



show your tree who’s boss!” 
Standing close against her hus- 
band, Naomi tried to stop shak- 
ing. But she lacked firm support, 
for Ted shook, too. 

His advice to Richard was 
sound, though. What had been a 
trap became, through grudging 
movement of the branches, a lad- 
der. Richard climbed down, scold- 
ing at the tre£ like an angry 
squirrel. 

N AOMI thought she’d suc- 
ceeded in shutting her mind. 
But when her little boy slid down 
the final bit of trunk and came for 
his present, Naomi broke. Like a 
startled animal, she thrust the 
book into his hands, picked him 
up and ran. Her mind was a jelly, 
red and quaking. 

She stopped momentarily after 
running fifty yards. “Burn the 
trees!” she screamed over her 
shoulder. “Burn the cabin! Burn 
it all!” She ran on, Ted’s answer- 
ing shouts beyond her compre- 
hension. 

Fatigue halted her. At the top 
of the rise between Cappy's farm 
and their own, pain and dizziness 
began flowing over her in waves. 
She set Richard down on the 
mauve soil and collapsed beside 
him. 

When she sat up, Richard 
squatted just out of reach, watch- 
ing curiously. She made an effort 
at casualness: “Let’s see what 



TREE, SPARE THAT WOODMAN 



117 



Daddy’s doing back there.” 

“He’s doing just what you said 
to, Mommie!” Richard answered 
indignantly. 

Her men were standing to- 
gether, Naomi realized. She 
laughed. After a moment, Richard 
joined her. Then he looked for his 
book, found it a few paces away, 
and brought it to her. 

“Read to me, Mommie.” 

“At home,” she said. 

Activity at Cappy’s interested 
her now. Wisps of smoke were 
licking around the trees. A tongue 
of flame lapped at one while she 
watched. Branches writhed. The 
trees were too slow-moving to 
escape ... 

But where was Ted? What had 
she exposed him to, with her 
hysterical orders? She held her 
breath till he moved within sight, 
standing quietly by a pile of sal- 
vaged tools. Behind him the cabin 
began to smoke. 

Ted wasn’t afraid, then. He 
understood what he faced. And 
Richard wasn’t afraid, either, be- 
cause he didn’t understand. 

But she? Surreptitiously Naomi 
pinched her hip till it felt black 
and blue. That was for being such 
a fool. She must not be afraid! 

“Daddy seems to be staying 
there,” she said. “Let’s wait for 
him at home, Richard.” 

“Are you going to make Daddy 
burn our tree? 

She jumped as if stung. Then, 



consciously womanlike, she sought 
relief in talk. 

“What do you think we should 
do, dear?” 

“Oh, I like the tree, Mommie. 
It’s cool under there. And the 
tree plays wtih me.” 

“How, Richard?” 

“If I’m pilot, he’s navigator. 
Or ship, maybe. But he’s so 
dumb, Mommie ! I always have to 
tell him everything. Doesn’t 
know what a fairy is, or Goldi- 
locks, or anything!” 

He clutched his book affec- 
tionately, rubbing his face on it. 
“Hurry up, Mommie. It’ll be 
bedtime before you ever read to 
me!” 

She touched his head briefly. 
“You can look at the book while 
I fix your supper.” 

OUT to explain Cappy’s pic- 
* tures — ‘crudely crayoned car- 
toons, really — she had to fill in 
the story they illustrated. She 
told it while Richard ate: how 
the intrepid Spaceman gallantly 
used his ray gun against the vil- 
lainous Martians to aid the green- 
haired Princess. Richard spooned 
up the thrills with his mush, gaz- 
ing fascinated at Cappy’s colorful 
and fantastic pictures, propped 
before him on the table. Had T ed 
been home, the scene might al- 
most have been blissful. 

It might have been ... if their 
6wn tree hadn’t reminded her of 



: GAIAX Y SCIENCE FICTION 



118 



Cappy’s. Still, she’ll almost man- 
aged to stuff her fear back into 
that mental pigeon-hole before 
their own tree. It was unbeliev- 
able, but she’d been glancing out 
the window every few minutes, 
so she saw it start. Their own tree 
began to walk. 

Down the hill it came — right 
there ! — framed in the window be- 
hind Richard’s head, moving 
slowly but inexorably on a root 
system that writhed along the 
surface. Like some ancient sculp- 
ture of- Serpents Supporting the 
Tree of Life. Except that it 
brought death . 

“Are you sick, Mommie?” 

No, not sick. Just something 
the matter with her throat, pre- 
venting a quick answer, leaving 
no way to keep Richard from 
turning to look out the window. 

“I think our tree is coming to 
play with me, Mommie.” 

No, no! Not Richard! 
“Remember how you used to 
say that abodt Cappy? When he 
was really coming to see your 
daddy?” 

“But Daddy isn’t home!” 

“He’ll get here, dear. Now eat 
your supper.” 

A lot to ask of an excited little 
boy. And the tree was his friend, 
it seemed. Cappy’s tree had even 
followed the child’s orders^ 
Richard might intercede— 

No! Expose him to such dan- 
ger? How could she think of it? 



“Had enough to eat, dear? 
Wash your hands and face at the 
pump, and you can stay out and 
play till Daddy gets home. I— I 
want- — — I' may have to see your 
friend, the tree, by myself . .” 
“But you haven’t finished my 
story !” 

“I will when Daddy gets home. 
And if I’m not here,, you tell 
- Daddy to do it.” 

“Where are you going, Mom - 
raie?” 

“I might see Cappy, dear. Now 
go and wash, please!” 

“Sure, Mommie. Don’t cry.” 
Accept his kiss, even if it is 
from a mouth rimmed with sup- 
per. And don’t rub it off till he’s 
gone out, you damned fool. You 
frightened fool. You shaking, 
sweating, terror-stricken fool. 

Who’s he going to kiss when 
you’re not here? 

The tree has stopped. Our little 
tree is having its supper. How 
nice. Sucking sustenance direct 
from soil with aid of sun and air 
in true plant fashion — but ex- 
hausting our mineral resources. 

{How wise of Ted to make you 
go to those lectures! You wouldn’t 
want to die in ignorance, would 
you?) 

The lecture — come on, let’s go 
back to the lecture! Let’s free 
our soil from every tree or we’ll 
not hold the joint in fee. No, not 
joint. A vulgarism, teacher would 
say. Methinks the times are out 



TREE, SPARE THAT WOODMAN 



119 



of joint. Aroint thee, tree! 

Now a pinch. Pinch yourself 
hard in the same old place so 
it’ll hurt real bad. Then straighten 
your face and go stick your head 
out the window. Your son is talk- 
ing — your son, your sun. 

Can your son be eclipsed by a 
tree? A matter of special spatial 
relationships, and the space is 
shrinking, friend. The tree is only 
a few hundred feet from the 
house. It has finished its little 
supper and is now running 
around. Like Richard. With 
Richard! Congenial, what? 

Smile, stupid. Your son speaks. 
Answer him. 

“What, dear?” 

“I see Daddy! He just came 
over the hill. He’s running! Can 
I go meet him, Mommie?” 

“No, dear. It’s too far.” 

Too far. Far too far. 

“Did you say something to me, 
Richard?” 

“No. I was talking to the tree. 
I’m the Spaceman and he’s the 
Martian. But he doesn’t want to 
be the Martian!” 

Richard plays. Let us play. 
Let us play. 

You’re close enough to get into 
the game, surely. A hundred and 
fifty feet, maybe. Effective range, 
fifty feet. Rate of motion? Pro- 
jected time-interval? Depends on 
which system you observe it from. 
Richard has a system. 

“He doesn’t want to play, 



Mommie. He wants to see you!” 
“You tell that tree your Mom- 
mie never sees strangers when 
Daddy isn’t home!” 

“I’ll make him wait!” 

Stoutly your pot-bellied little 
protector prevents his protective 
mother from going to pot. 

“If he won’t play, I’ll use my 
ray gun on him!” 

Obviously, the tree won’t play. 
Watch your son lift empty hands, 
-arm himself with a weapon yet 
to be invented, and open fire 
on the advancing foe. 
“Aa-aa-aa!” 

So that’s how a ray gun sounds! 
“You’re dead, tree! You’re 
dead! Now you can’t play with 
me any more. You’re dead!” 

OEEING it happen, then, watch - 
' ^ ing the tree accept the little 
boy’s fantasy as fact, Naomi won- 
dered why she’d never thought of 
that herself. 

So the tree was a treacherous 
medicine -man, was it? A true 
believing witch-doctor? And who 
could be more susceptible to the 
poisoning of fear than a witch- 
doctor who has made fear work — 
and believes it’s being used against 
him? 

It was all over. She and the 
tree bit the dust together. But 
the tree was dead, and Naomi 
merely fainting, and Ted would 
soon be home ...

rpHIS is Clarke Year, it seems; 
■*- and a very good year it is, too. 
To take the non-fiction book first, 
The Exploration of Space is a 
completely -satisfying job. The 
first -book about astronautics and 
the mechanics ' of traveling and 
living in space to be taken by the 
Book of the .Month Club, it does 
not assume that you have a Ph.D. 



★ * * * ★ SHELF 



in Extraterrestrial Vector Analy- 
sis (whatever that is', if it exists). 
However, it does assume that you 
are a normally thoughtful, edu- 
cated, imaginative citizen with a 
fairly mature approach. In other 
words, not for morons. 

Above all, it is soundly scien- 
tific; there is nothing crackpot 
about it. Its prophecies of future 
developments may often be 
proved wrong in detail, but they 
are definitely logical in theory. 

From a brief historical survey, 
beginning with Lucian, of the 
ideas of space travel, we pass to 
a marvelously comprehensible 
analysis of . the principles of the 
rocket motor, and thence to the 



121 



nature of the Solar System, the 
methods of escaping from Earth’s 
gravity, possible spaceships, and 
so on, via some highly realistic 
domed cities on Mars to the far- 
distant possibilities of travel to 
the stars. 

Illustration-wise, this book is, 
next to the Bonestell-Ley Con- 
quest of Space, the handsomest 
production yet in this field. From 
simple diagrams which brilliantly 
explain such recondite subjects 
as gravity, to a number of gor- 
geous full-color plates, one of 
which shows the domed city of 
Mars in a breathtaking fashion, 
the book is a treasure-chest of 
pictorial and scientific richness. 

Sands of Mars, Clarke’s never- 
serialized second novel, is a fit 
successor to^ Prelude to Space, 
which appeared as a GALAXY' 
novel a couple of years ago. Like 
Prelude, it is utterly real, as real 
as only someone who knows the 
current facts about space flight 
can make this sort of imaginative 
writing. 

The story tells of the voyage 
to Mars of a famous newsman 
and ex -science -fiction -novelist by 
the name of Martin Gibson, and 
his conversion from an anti-Mars 
character to an all-out enthusiast. 
A subplot describing the emo- 
tional woes Gibson suffers when 
he recognizes one of the space- 
ship crew as his illegitimate son 



slows the story a little, but un- 
questionably adds to the impact 
of the novel. These are people, 
not “spacemen,” we are meeting. 

The trip through space is noth- 
ing beyond what we can find 
in The Exploration of Space , 
decked out in fictional garments. 
Clarke’s Mars, on the other hand, 
is a logical leap into the dark. 
None of the inventions and ideas 
is particularly unlikely, though, 
and all of them are put in a clear 
and unforgettable light by the 
author’s ability at visualizing the 
uncreated. 

One may perhaps be justified 
in a slight cringe at the super- 
scientific way the problems of 
Mars’ cold and its low oxygen are 
eventually solved; but even that 
technique should not seem totally 
unlikely when one suddenly real- 
izes that one has blithely ac- 
cepted without a whimper the 
fantastic — but scientifically quite 
sound — idea of a spaceship for 
the Mars run which is capable of 
transporting 180 people! 

Genuinely good reading.

npHE indefatigable Chicagoans,

annual series, and -a good idea, 
too — a collection of the “best” 
novelets of the year. Stories of 
this length are usually problems 
for the anthologist, whose pub- 
lisher often presses him for “more 
stories per book.” As a result, 
some of the best science fiction 
has long missed the momentary 
immortality of hard covers. 

The “bestness” of the five nov- 
elets included is, of course, de- 
batable; no one should ever ex- 
pect any collection to be wholly 
pleasing to himself. Tastes differ 
too much. But this collection is 
at least a good average. 

No one could possibly veto Eric 
Frank Russell’s superb “. And 
Then There Were None,” cer- 
tainly one of the most evocative 
and provocative idea novelets 
that ever hit the literature of 
space travel. The Gands, with 
their wonderful “Myob!” and 
“F — I. W.” slogans, will never be 
forgotten by anyone who reads 
about them. 

Arthur Clarke’s sensitive and 
perceptive “Seeker of the Sphinx” 
is a top selection, too. In a de- 
lightful and obviously quite un- 
premeditated way, its ideas play a 
sort of warm and contrasty coun- 
terpoint to the theme of Russell’s 
tale. 

“Hunting Season” by Frank M. 
Robinson is a good one, too, 
though a bit slobbery. This re- 
viewer felt that the idea was bet-

est,” but there is enough merit 
in the Robinson -story to make 
its reprinting a good idea. 

I didn’t think too much of Poul 
Anderson’s post-Einstein re-do oi 
the Wellsian “Time Machine,” 
which is called “Flight to For- 
ever” and which is super-impos- 
sible science fantasy ; and nothing 
at all of Walter Miller’s “Izzard 
and the Membrane,” which dem- 
onstrates how political propa- 
ganda can ruin science fiction. 

Nevertheless, the collection as 
a whole is eminently worthwhile. 
May there be more in the series!

'T’HiS strange and fascinating 
•*- program for the future • of 
Man, reported in seven Astound- 
ing stories and one from Thrill- 
ing Wonder, all but one collected 
in book form here for the first 
time, describes a tomorrow that is, 
for me, completely enthralling. 

Commencing with a simple pic- 
ture of the end of Cities as a re- 
sult of decentralization caused 
by the family helicopter and 
chemical gardening, it ends up 
with a series of parallel worlds, 
one of which is in possession of 
ants, another controlled by a very 
attractive dog civilization (the 



123 



stories are legends on this world), 
and a third consisting of the 
planet Jupiter, where the human 
race, wholly transformed into a 
new type of life, has abandoned 
humanity, with all its faults. 

One has the pleasant^ feeling 
that the series was written for 
the fun of it, not to uphold any 
theories, not to satirize anything, 
not for filthy lucre, and not, in- 
deed, for any particular audience 
except the author himself. This 
makes the book all the more de- 
lightful. 

The Dogs, who tell the legends^ 
seriously doubt whether Man, 
with his wars and his crimes, 
ever existed at all, and if he did, 
they wonder why. Smart people, 
those Dogs; they suspect the tales 
are pure fabrications of the pre- 
civilized Dog mind. Anthropol- 
ogy, indeed! What could you call 
it with Dogs? Canopology, I pre- 
sume.

1 AM of that select and goodly 
company of stuffed shirts who 
deny that humor and science fic- 
tion can successfully intermingle. 
In this I am, of course, something 
of a wet blanket about the drun- 
ken Gallagher and his narcis- 
sistic robot, Joe, the lead charac- 
ters in this book. 



On the other hand, my decla- 
mations at times falter to a halt 
when, in spite of myself, I hear 
myself busting out in giggles over 
some absurdity of these two 
strictly synthetic and primitive 
pieces of pulp characterization. 
This does not mean that I think 
the Gallagher series is good 
science fiction, for it isn’t — zany 
imaginings of a rather anti-scien- 
tific sort. 

The principles seem to be: 
“Scientists invent when drunk.” 
“Research and invention is an 
individual, not a cooperative ef- 
fort; a subconscious, rather than 
an intellectual effort.” Very un- 
helpful conclusions that can be 
deduced from the actually harm- 
less and often amusing adven- 
tures of this ga-ga technician and 
his super-robot in an overscien- 
tific, undersociologized world 
which continues to misuse science 
and technology just ah we do. 

Perhaps I’m being unneces- 
sarily serious. Point is, I want to 
let Mr. Kuttrier know I enjoy 
him still and realize that he is 
putting over some very nice sat- 
irical points in these stories, even 
though you have to hunt for 
them ( Padgett is Mr. Kuttner.) 

Vital statistics: the book has 
five Gallagher stories, all from 
Astounding; and two (“Gallagher 
Plus” and “The World Is Mine”) 
never before anthologized.

though, money a-plenty. Funny 
about drinking. The wobbling,

Important discovery. Boon to

plated. Liquor drops into a pit, 
clunk. Walk steady, talk steady. 
Put in come the illusions on little 
soft pink feet. 

Ruth ahead of you, hurrying 
down a dark street. “Ruth! 
Wait!” 

Hurriedly she puts on a wat- 
tled mask, turns and grimaces at 
you, rasps in a mocking gin- 
husky voice. “Ya wan’ something, 
sweetie?” 

S HE has slipped around the 
next corner. Run, now, and 
see her in the next block. Cake 
the wet December slush on the 
shrinking, stiffening leather of 
the shoes that came out of that, 
store window. 

“Marty, let’s buy you a pair 
of those. I like those shoes.” 

Suit she liked. Now a bit drib- 
bled, a shade rancid. Apartment 
the way they had left it that 
night. Never gone back. Beds not 
made, no doubt. 

Walk through the night streets, 
looking for punishment. Looking 
for a way to release the load of 
guilt. Now the old places don’t 
want you. “Sorry, Mr. Grey nor. 
.You've begun to stink.” The lit- 

1*6 



tie bars don’t care, 

“flTAP-PEEE NEW YEAR!” 
The bar mirrors are enchanted. 
Ruth stands behind you. She 
said, “Never run away from me, 
dariing. You’d be too easy to 
find. Wanted — a red-headed man 
with one blue eye and one brown 
eye. See? You couldn’t get away 
with it.” 

The face that looks hack has 
been gaunted, because you stop- 
ped eating. 

He bent low over- the bar until 
his lips almost touched the shot 
glass, then lifted it in a hard arc, 
tossing his head back. It burned 
its way down into the nothing- 
ness. The bartender slapped the 
change down. Martin Greynor 
fumbled with it, pushed a quar- 
ter over to the far edge. The bar- 
tender slipped it off the bar with 
a surly grunt- and clinked it into 
& glass on the back bar. 

Martin turned around and saw 
the three girls again. He wonder- 
ed if it was again, or if he was 
seeing them for the first time. 
The mind performs such odd lit- 
tle hop, skip, jumps. He debated 
it solemnly, got nowhere. 

They were at a table. They 
were all looking at him with an 
air of watchfulness. That could 
be imagined, too. Three lovelies 
like that are not going to make 
the weary, ginmill rounds with 
you and keep watching you. You 
ain’t that purty, Martin.

When in doubt, you write it 
down on top of your mind and 
underline it very firmly and hope 
that when the situation occurs 
again, you can find the place 
where you wrote it down. 

He walked out steadily and 
stood oil the sidewalk. He had the 
strong impression that Ruth was 
stretched flat on the roof,, her 
head over the edge of the build- 
ing, grinning down at him. He 
turned sharply and looked up. 
The Moon hung misty over Man- 
hattan, debauched by neon. 

T^EXT block. Don’t turn right. 

’ That will take you toward 
midtown, toward the higher 
prices, toward the places where 
they let you get three steps in- 
side the door, then turn you firm- 
ly and walk you back out. Stay 
over here, buster. 

They’d rolled him a few times 
that first week. Made a nuisance 
to go to the bank and get more 
'cash each time. Now they’d stop- 
ped bothering. One of the times 
they’d left him sitting, spitting 
out a tooth. His tongue kept find- 
ing the hole. 

Neon in the middle of the next 
block. Two couples sitting on the 
curb. 

“Down by-ee the old mill 
streeeeeeem . .” 

Spotted by the prowl car. 

“Break it up! Move along 
there!” 

GAME FOR BLONDES 



TTE looked back. Three female 
silhouettes, arm in arm, step 
in step, tick-tock-tick of the pret- 
ty stilt heels avoiding the gray 
smears of slush. 

He ducked into the door under 
the neon. This was a dark one. 
Dancing was going on back there 
somewhere to the cat-fence yowl 
of a clarinet and pulse-thump of 
piano. He edged in at the bar. 
The bartender came over fast, 
with that trouble-look on his face. 
Martin shoved the five out fast. 

“Rye straight,” he said. 

The bartender paused for a 
count of three, then turned back 
to the rye department. 

Martin looked over and saw 
them come in. He hunted on top 
of his mind and found the heav- 
ily underlined place. He read it 
off. Three blondes. Three arro- 
gant, damp-mouthed, hot-eyed, 
overdressed blondes — sugary in 
the gloom. Same ones. 

- It brought him up out of him- 
self, hand clutching the rim of 
his soul, for a quick look over 
the edge. One lone blonde in this 
place would have pivoted heads 
in tennis-match style. Two would 
bring hot arid heart-felt exhala- 
tions. Three, he saw, seemed to 
stun the joint. It put a crimp in 
the rumble of bar-talk. It ran 
furry fingers down male spines. 

They were watching him. He 
stared back until he was certain. 
Okay. Fact confirmed. Three 



127 



blondes following him from joint 
to joint. Watching him. Next 
step — watch real close, see if any- 
body walks through them. 

They got a table along the wall. 
He watched. A hefty young man 
strutted over to their table, hik- 
ing up his pants, making with the 
bold smile. He bent over the 
table. They all gave him cold 
looks. One shook her shining 
head. He persisted. 

The young man turned fast 
and hard and went high and rigid 
into the air. Martin saw him go 
up in that jet-leap of spasmed 
muscles, head thrown back, ag- 
ony-masked face. He fell like 
something pushed out of a win- 
dow. People gathered around 
him. They blocked Martin’s 
view. 

He* looked at the blondes. They 
were watching him. In an empty 
lot in the back of his mind, a 
rabbit bounded for cover, where 
there was no cover, and the dogs, 
sat watching, tongues lolling. 
Cold started at a spot at the base 
of his spine. It crept nuzzling 
into his armpits. 

He drank and scooped up his 
change and left. 

He ran to the corner and stood, 
and the trembling went away. 
The 'slush was beginning to 
freeze. It crunched a bit under 
hts shoes. That was another 
thing. You didn’t have to eat, 
and you didn’t get cold. Ergo, 



one should be beyond fear. Go 
around being afraid of blondes 
and people will begin to point at 
you. 

He snickered. The sound was j 
as rigid as the rind of freeze atop 
the sidewalk slush. We have \ 
nothing to fear but fear itself. ; 

Problem for the class: You got ' 
a guy, see. He’s dying of cancer } 
or something, see. He’s in agony 
and somebody comes into his 
room and stands by his bed and 
lifts a big club to hammer him 
one. Is the guy afraid? If so, \ 
why? If he is, it means that fear j 
is something divorced from an 1 
objective and intellectual ap- 1 
praisal of the total situation. It 
means fear is spawned in the guts, 
down there where the animal 
lives, down where the rabbit j 
blood is. J 

A PIECE of paper scuttered 
around the corner and em- 
braced his leg. He bent over, pick- 
ed it loose and sent it on its way. 

“Hell of a big hurry, aren’t 
you?” he said. 

Tick, tack, tick, tack. By God. 
perfect marching. Ex-WACs? A‘l 
blonde and all coming along. S 
what can blondes do to you? He 
stood his ground for a slow count 
of ten. 

Tick, tack. 

Fear rocketed into his throat 
and burst out his ears and he ran 
like hell.

A cruiser nailed him in the 
spotlight/ tracking him like 
a floorshow, making him feel as 
though he were running, running, 
running in one spot. He stopped 
and leaned against a building, 
panting. The spot still held him. 
It nailed his eyes to the wall be- 
hind him. Big shoulders blocked 
it. Creak of leather and brass 
gleam. 

“What you running for, chief?” 

“It’s ... a cold night. Keeping 
warm.” 

The cuff, slid him along the 
wall and the hand on his rancid 
suit yanked him back upright. 
“What you running for, I said?” 

“Those three blondes coming. 
They’re after me.” He could hear 
them coming. The spot went 
away. He was blind. But he, 
could hear them. 

“After you, you creep?” 



“Yes, I . .” 

“Johnny, we better dump the 
chief here off at the ward. Come 
on, Mr. Irresistable.” 

Tick, tack, tock, tick. Silence. 
“What do you girls want?” 
Brass buttons took a high, 
hard, stiff-legged, stiff-armed 
leap. Martin fell into slush and 
rolled. Inside the cruiser, the 
driver stiffened, his head going 
bong on the metal roof. 



|LfffARTIN ran, bleating. An 
empty field and no cover. 
The wise eyes of the hunting

dogs. Wait until Ije comes around 
again, fellows. 

He turned, skidding in the 
freezing slush, and ran inb an 
alley, tangling his legs in a bunch 
of trash, sprawling, clawing his 
way up again, running into a 
wall, stinging his hands. He turn- 
ed. Three female silhouettes in 
the alley mouth. High-waVed, 
long-legged, stilt-heeled, cream- 
headed. 

He made little sounds in his 
throat and pawed his way along 
the wall. An alley like a shoe box 
with one end missing — the end 
they were at. 

He sat down and covered his 
eyes. Count to ten and they’ll go 
away. One-a-larry, two-a-larry, 
three-a-larry, four. 

New spotlight. This was a dif- 
erent one. It came at him from a 
lot of little directions, like one of 
those trick showers with a dozen 
spray heads. 

“Got um,” a blonde voice said. 

“Up to spec, no?” 

They stood outside the radi- 
ance. 

“Color and out,” one said. 

“Take um.” 

Something grew in front of 
him, a red happy-new-year bal- 
loon. So it was a gag, maybe. It 
lobbed through the air toward 
him, turning in iridescence. He 
caught it. It was red jelly with a 
cellophane skin. It kept trying to 
slide down between his fingers. 



GAME FOR BLONDES 



12 * 



“Yah-hah!” one of the blondes 
said. 

It broke in his hands, showered 
green needles up to his nose to 
sizzle in his brain fat. 

The sky broke in half and he 
went over backward and down, 
heels up and over, sizzling. 

M ARTIN slid naked across a 
mirrored floor. He was bug- 
sized and it was the mirror on 
his mother’s dressing table a mil- 
lion years ago. He stopped slid- 
ing and tried to sit up. The 
bracing hand skidded and he hit 
his head. 

He tried more cautiously. He 
could sit up by carefully shifting 
his weight, but he couldn’t stand. 
The surface was frictionless. 
Compared to it, glare ice was like 
sandpaper. 

He lay down" and looked up. 
Overhead was nothing. He 
thought about that for quite a 
while. Nothing. No thing. Noth- 
ing with a flaw in it. A little 
flaw. He peered at it. It was in 
the shape of a tiny naked man. 
He moved a leg. The tiny naked 
man moved a leg. Everything 
clicked into focus. A mirror 
under him and, at an incredible 
height above him, another. 

Now, he thought, I’m a germ 
on a big microscope. His body 
felt odd. He managed to sit up 
again. He looked at himself. 
Clean. Impossibly, incredibly 



clean. His fingernails were snowy. 
His toenails were like white pa- 
per. His skin was clean and pink 
with a glow of health, but the old 
heart went thudding slowly and 
sickly along. 

Silence. All he could hear was 
the roar of his blood in his ears. 
Like listening to a sea shell. 
There had been a big pink conch 
in his grandfather’s house. • 

“Hear the sea, Marty?” 

The mirror tilted and he slid 



into a hole that wasn’t there be- 
fore. He came out into a square | 
blue room. , 

His three blondes were there, i 
watching him. We don’t get pink j 
elephants. We don’t get snakes j 
and bugs. We get blondes. | 

He stood up, too aware of his i 
nudity. They watched him calm- 
ly, ignoring it. 

“Now, look,” he said, “can’t 
we be friends?” ^ 

They had changed. Their 
mouths were different — vivid 
green paint in a perfect rectangle. 
They looked at him with that 
calm pride of ownership. Nice 
doggy. * 

“Now, look,” Re began again, 
and stopped when he noticed 
their strange dresses. He looked 
closer. Ladies, please, you can’t 
dress with a paint spray. But 
they had. 

“This,” he said, “is a night- 
mare by Petty, out of Varga ’’

shaded at the edges, but just "a 
paint job. One of them stepped 
to him, grabbed him by the hair 
and tilted his head back. She 
looked into his eyes and made a 
little satisfied clucking sound. 
She turned and pointed to the 
corner. 

“ Y up now,” she said. 

“How does one go about yup- 
ping?” he asked vacantly. » 

She looked at one of the other 
blondes, who said slowly and 
precisely, “Hurry — up — now. 
late.” 

There was a pile of clothes in 
the corner.' He went over, glad 
for a chance of regaining pants, 
even in a dream world. The 
garments were recognizable, the 
material wasn’t. A sartorial car- 
toon of the American male, 
mid- twentieth century. Every in- 
congruity of the clothing exagger- 
ated. Sleeve buttons like saucers. 
Shoulders padded out a foot on 
each side. No buttons, no snaps, 
no zippers. You just got inside 
them and they were on, somehow.* 
The buttons on the suit were 
fakes. The suit was bright blue 
with a harsh red stripe. 

Dressed, he felt like a straight 
man in a burlesque. 

From a distance he heard a 
great shout. It sounded like 
“Yah-hah!” from ten thousand 
throats. He suddenly had the 
strong hunch that he was going 
on display. 



The nearest blonde- confirmed 
that hunch. She stepped over and 
clamped a metal circlet around 
his forehead. 

Three golden chains dangled 
from his headpiece. Each blonde 
took one chain. The nearest one 
to one of the blue walls touched 
it. A slit appeared and folded 
back. They went through. The 
blondes began to strut. A mid- 
way strut. A stripper stomp. 

“Here comes Martin,” he said 
feebly. 

TTE was in the middle of a gar- 
den. The clipped turf under- 
foot was springy. Tailored 
terraces rose on three sides. A fat 
sun and a billion flowers and 
several thousand exceptionally 
handsome people wearing paint 
jobs and nothing else. 

The center arena had some 
people in it, people fastened to 
chains as he was, each one held 
by three blondes. The spectators 
were all on the terraces. There 
was a picnic atmosphere. 

They went into the middle of 
the arena. The other captives 
were being led in an endless 
circle. 

“Yah-hah!” the multitude 
yelled. “Yah-hah-hah!” 

They posed in the center and 
then began the circling. Martin 
stared at his fellow captives. 
Some were men and some were 
women. One wore animal skins; 



GAME FOR BLONDES 



131 



another wore armor. One was 
dressed like the pictures of George 
Washington. Some wore clothing 
he’d never seen before. 

He was led .around and around. 
More performers took 'their cen- 
ter ring bow. Something was 
bothering him, some silly small 
thing. He couldn’t fit his mind 
over it. Too much was going on 
in this delirium. 

Then he got it — all the captives 
had red hair. 

He turned and looked at the 
scared woman who walked be- 
hind him. She had red hair, one 
blue eye and one brown eye. She 
wore gingham and a sunbonnet. 

He sneaked looks at the 
others. One blue eye. One brown 
eye. Red hair. 

Everyone stopped walking. 
There was a great and final, 
“Yah-hah.” Three sets of blondes 
stood in the center ring without 
captives. Their heads were bowed. 

His blondes trotted him over, 
took off the circlet and flipped 
him back into the blue room. 
The slit was closed. He pinched 
his leg. 

“Hell,” he said softly. 

The slit opened after what he 
imagined to be an hour had 
passed. One of his blondes came 
back. She had a man with her, a 
chesty citizen dressed in cerise 
paint. 

“Talkit ya tempo,” she said, 
pointing at the chesty man.

He beamed at Martin. “Bless- 
ings,” he said. 

“Blessings yourself.” 

“Indebted. Thanking very 
much.” 

“Your welcoming very much, 
bud.” 

“Knowing all?” the man asked 
with a wide arm sweep. 

“Knowing nothing. Not a 
damned thing! What’s this all 
about?” 

The chesty man beamed some 
more. He scratched his paint job 
lightly. He frowned. “Hard to 
say. You past. I future. Is party. 
My party. My house. My gar- 
den. Having game. Sending ladies 
your tempo, lot of tempos. All 
same thing. Bringing only with 
red on hair, eye brown, eye blue. 
Hard to find. For game.” 

Martin goggled at him. “You 
mean a scavenger hunt through 
time?” 

“Not knowing. Is only game. 
Some ladies failing. Too bad.” 

“What happens to them?” 

The man grinned. “No present 
for them. Now, present for you. 
Returning. Any place in tempo 
yours. To place taken. To other 
place. Sooner, later. Your 
choice.” 

“Return me to any . moment 
in my life?” 

“All tempo function. You say 
»—how? — resonance.” 

“Send me to December 10th, 
eight P.M.” „ 



M artin greynor was sit 

ting on the edge of his bed. 
He had just yanked his shoelaces 
tight in the left shoe. The tipped 
laces were still in his hands. He 
let go of them. He heard a show- 
er pouring. The sound stopped 
suddenly. 

His throat was full of rusty 
wire. “Ruth?” 

She opened the bathroom dooi . 
She was wrapped in a big yellow 
towel. 

“What is it now, Marty? My 
goodness, you’ve been needling 
me all evening. You’re in a per- 
fectly foul humor. I’m hurrying 
just as fast as I can.” 

“Ruth, I . He tried to 
smile. His lips felt split. 

She came to him, quick with 
concern. “Marty! Are you all 
right, darling? You look so odd. " 
“Me? I’ve never been more all 
right.” He pulled her down be- 
side him. 

“Hey, you! I’m soaking wet.” 
“Baby, do we have to drive 
way out there tonight? Do we?” 
She stared at him. “Good Lord, 
it was your idea. I detest both of 
them.’ You know that.” 

“Let’s stay home. Just the two 
of us. Bust open that brandy, 
maybe. Use up some of those

ter this way, instead of all snarly

think we could phone and tell 
them you have a fever, darling. 
It wouldn’t really be a lie.” 

S HE made the call, winking at 
him as she gave worried 
noises about his symptoms. She 
hung up and said, “She was huf- 
fy and painfully sweet. Tonight 
the Grey nor s are at home. Dar- 
ling, it would have been a crum- 
my evening.” 



“A . , disastrous evening.” 
“They play kid games all the 
time. That’s what irks me. Re- 
member in the summer? They 
had a scavenger hunt. If that 
isn’t the height of silliness!” 

He looked at the fire glow re- 
flected in her hair. 

“It isn’t a bad game, baby.” 
“What do you mean?” 

He shrugged. “Guess it depends 
on who’s playing it and what the 
prize is.”

Forecast 

Leading next month's issue is a compellingiy convincing novella, THE 
MARTIAN WAY by Isaac Asimov, one of the most ingenious, human and 
down-to-probability stories this superb and popular author has ever pro- 
duced. Science fiction often has a way of ignoring the potential realities 
of such forthcoming situations as space travel— though GALAXY strives 
hard to discover and deal with them— and Asimov presents a type of fuel 
and the problems -that getting it involve, entirely new to this medium, as 
far as we on GALAXY know. The solution is in line with the very latest 
discovery about our own solar system. 

Supporting Asimov's suspensefui offering are:

In this carefully chosen, precision-trained 
space crew, where did a fumbling bubble- 



head like Bertelli fit in? Why was he selected?

Isn't it strange that princes and

And clowns that caper in sawdust 
rings 

And ordinary folk like you and 
me 

Are builders of eternity. 

To each is given a bag of tools. 

An hour-glass and a book of

And each must buitd ere his time

T HE SHIP hummed and 
thrummed and drummed. 
It was a low-cycle note, 



A LltTLE OIL 



137 



sonorous and penetrating like 
that produced by the big-pipe 
octave of a mighty organ. It 
moaned through hull-plates, 
groaned out of girders, throbbed 
along nerves and bones, -beat 
upon tired ears and could not be 
ignored. Not after a week, a 
month or a year. Certainly not 
after most of four years. 

There was no effective cure for 
the noise. It was the inevitable, 
unavoidable result of bottling an 
atomic propulsor within a cylin- 
der of highly conductive metal. 
The first ship had screeched one 
hundred cycles higher, minute 
after minute, hour after hour, and 
had never returned. Somewhere 
amid the waste spaces of the in- 
finite, it might still be howling, 
unheard, unheeded, after thirty 
years. 

Ship number two had started 
out with a slag-wool padded en- 
gine room and silicone-lined ven- 
turis. The low note. The drone of 
a burdened bee amplified twenty 
thousand times. And the bee had 
not come back to the hive. 
Eighteen years into the star field 
and blindly heading onward for 
another hundred, thousand or ten 
thousand years. 

The vessel now thundering 
along was number three, not go- 
ing outward, but on it's way back, 
beading for home. Nosing toward 
w not- yet- visible red dot lost in 
the mist of stars, a strayed soul 



fumbling for salvation, it was de- 
termined not to be damned as 
others -had been damned. Ship 
number three — that meant some- 
thing. 

Sea sailors cherish sea super- 
stitions. Space sailors coddle 
space superstitions. In the cap- 
tain’s cabin where Kinrade 
sat writing the log, a supersti- 
tion was pinned to the wall and 
functioned as a morale booster. 

- THIRD TIME DOES IT! 

They had believed it at the 
start when the crew had number- 
ed nine. They would believe it at 
the finish, though reduced to six. 
But in between times there had 
been and might again be bad 
moments of shaken faith when 
men wanted out at any cost, even 
the cost of death, and to hell 
with the ultimate purpose of the 
flight. Moments when men fought 
other men in effort to break loose 
from audiophobia, claustropho- 
bia, half a dozen other phobias. 

K INRADE wrote with the pen 
in his right hand, a blued- 
steel automatic within easy reach 
of his left. His eyes concentrated 
on the log, his ears on the ship 
and its everlasting drumming. 
The noise might hesitate, falter 
or cease, and the blessing of its 
cessation would be equally a 
curse. Or other sounds might rise

above this persistent background, 
an oath, a shout, a shot. It had 
happened once before, when 
Wey garth cracked. It could hap- 
pen again. 

Kinrade was somewhat edgy 
himself, for he jerked in his seat 
and slid his left hand sidewise 
when Bertelli came in unexpect- 
edly. Recovering, he swung his 
chair round on its socket, gazed 
into the other’s sad gray eyes. 

“Well, have they' marked it 
yet?” 

The question startled Bertelli. 
His long, lugubrious, hollow- 
cheeked face grew longer. His 
great gash of a mouth drooped at 
the corners. The sad eyes took 
on an expression of hopeless baf- 
flement. He was clumsily embar- 
rassed. 

Recognizing these familiar 
symptoms, Kinrade became more 
explicit. “Is Sol visible on the 
screen?” 

“Sol?” Bertelli ’s hands tangled 
together, the fingers like carrots. 

“Our own sun, you imbecile!” 

“Oh, that!” The eyes widened 
in delighted comprehension. “I 
haven’t asked.” 

“I thought maybe you’d come 
to tell me they’ve got it spotted 
at last.” 

“No, Captain. It’s just that I 
wondered whether you need any 
help.” His expression switched 
from its accustomed glumness to 
the eager smile of a fool more 

A 1 1 T T I E OIL 



than willing to serve. The mouth 
lifted, widened so much that it 
made the ears stick out and re- 
minded the onlooker of a slice 
of melon. 

“Thanks,” said Kinrade, more 
kindly. “Not right now.” 

Bertelli’s embarrassment came 
back in painful strength. His face 
was humbly apologetic for hav- 
ing asked. After shifting around 
on his big, ugly feet, he went out. 
As always, he skidded violently 
on the steel-floored catwalk, re- 
gained balance with a clatter of 
heavy boots. Nobody else slipped 
at that spot, but he invariably 
did. 

Kinrade suddenly realized that 
he was smiting and changed it to 
a troubled frown. For the hun- 
dredth time he consulted the 
ship’s register, found it no more 
informative than on the ninety- 
nine other occasions. There was 
the little roster with three names 
of the nine crossed out. And the 
same entry halfway down: En- 
rico Bertelli, thirty-two, psychol- 
ogist. 

It was the bunk. If Bertelli 
were a psychologist or anything 
remotely connected with scientif- 
ic expertness, then he, Robert 
Kinrade, was a bright blue gi- 
raffe. For almost four years 
they'd been locked together in 
this groaning cylinder, six men 
carefully chosen from the great 
mass of humanity, six men sup- 

m 



posed to be the salt of the Earth, 
the cream of their kind. But the 
six were five men and a fool. 

There was a puzzle here. It in- 
trigued him in spare moments 
when he had time to think with 
a mind untrammeled by serious 
matters. It dangled before him 
tantalizingly, making him repeat- 
edly picture its subject all the 
way down from sad eyes to flat 
feet. During rare moments of. 
meditation, he found himself 
vainly trying to analyze Bertelli 
and deduce the real reason for his 
being, concentrating upon him to 
the temporary exclusion of the 
others. 

As opportunity occurred, Kin- 
rade watched him, too, marvel- 
ing that any so-called expert 
could be so thoroughly and un- 
failingly nit-witt'ed. He studied 
Bertelli with such intentness that 
he failed to notice whether the 
others might be doing the same 
for similar reasons born of sim- 
ilar thoughts. 

Yet this concentration was his 
answer — and he did not know it. 

M ARSDEN was duty naviga- 
tor and Vail stood guard in 
the engine room when Kinrade 
went to lunch. The other three 
already were at the table in the 
tiny galley. He nodded briefly 
and took his place. 

Big blond Nilsen, atomic en- 
gineer by choice, plus botanist by 



official coercion, eyed Kinrade 
skeptically and said, “No sun.” 

“I know?” 

“There ought to be.” 

Kinrade shrugged. 

“But there isn’t,” Nilsen per- 
sisted. 

“I know.” 

“Do you care?” 

“Don’t be a sap.” Breaking 
open a packaged meal, Kinrade 
tossed it into his compartmented 
plastic plate. 

Thrum-thrum went the ship 
i from floor, walls and ceiling, 
i “So you think I’m a sap, do 
you?” Nilsen leaned forward, 
stared with aggressive expect- 
ancy. 

“Let’s eat,” suggested Aram, 
the thin, dark and nervous cos- 
mogeologist at his side. “One 
bellyache’s enough without hunt- 
ing another.” 

“That’s not the point,” de- 
clared Nilsen. “I want to know 
>> ■ 

He shut up as Bertelli mum- 
; bled, “Pardon me,” and reached 
across him for salt in a container 
fastened to the other end of the 
table. 

Unscrewing it, Bertelli brought 
: it to his end, sat down, found 

himself on the extreme edge of 
his seat. His eyes popped very 
slightly in mild surprise. He 
stood, slid the seat forward on its 
runners, sat again, knocked the 
salt off the table. Radiating 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



£46 



shame and self-consciousness, he 
picked it up, used it in the man- 
ner of one emptying a large 
bucket, practically lay full length 
on the table to screw it in its 
original position. That task per- 
formed, he squirmed backward 
with his behind in the air, gained 
the seat again. 

It was the edge and so near 
that he began to slide off it. The 
eyes bulged a fraction more wide- 
ly than before and once again he 
went through the seat-sliding per- 
formance. Finally he sat down, 
smoothed out an invisible nap- 
kin, favored everyone with a look 
of abject apology. 

Taking in a deep breath, Nil- 
sen said to him, “Sure you 
wouldn’t care for a little more 
salt?” 

Bertelli’s eyes dulled under the 
impact of the problem, sought 
his plate, examined it with idiot- 
ic care, “No, I don’t think so, 
thank you.” 

Surveying his own plate a mo- 
ment, Nilsen looked up, met Kin- 
rade’s eyes, asked, “What’s this 
guy got that others haven’t got?” 

Grinning at him, Kinrade re- 
plied, “That problem is a corker. 
I’ve been trying to figure it out 
and I can’t.” 

A half-smile came into Nilsen’s 
features as he confessed, “Neither 
can I.” 

Bertelli said nothing. He went 
on with his meal, eating in char- 



acteristic manner with elbows 
held high and his hand uncertain- 
ly seeking a mouth it could not 
miss. 

P UTTING a pencil-tip to the 
screen, Marsden said, “That 
one looks pink to me. But it may 
be my imagination.” 

Kinrade bent close and had a 
look. “Too small to be sure. A 
mere pinpoint.” 

“Then I’ve been kidding my- 
self.” 

“Not necessarily. Your eyes 
may be more color-sensitive than 
mine.” 

“Ask Goofy here,” suggested 
Marsden. 

Bertelli examined the brilliant 
dot from ten different distances 
and as many angles. Finally he 
squinted at it. 

“That can’t be it,” he an- 
nounced, triumphant with discov- 
ery, “because our sun is orange- 
red.” 

“The fluorescent coating -of the 
screen would make it look pink,” 
informed Marsden with a touch 
of impatience. “Does that dot 
look pink?” 

“I don’t know,” Bertelli ad- 
mitted miserably. 

“You’re a great help.” 

“It’s too far away for more 
than mere guesswork,” said Kin- 
rade. “Resolution isn’t good 
enough to cope with such a dis- 
tance. We’ll have to wait until 



A LITTLE OIL 



T41 



we get a good deal closer.” 

“I’m fed up waiting,” .said 
Marsden, scowling at the screen. 

“But we’re going home,” Ber- 
telli reminded him. 

“I know. That’s what’s* killing 
me.” 

“Don’t you want to go home?” 
Bertelli puzzledly asked. 

“I want to too much.” Irri- 
tatedly, Marsden rammed the 
pencil back into his pocket. “I 
thought I’d stand the inward trip 
better than the outward one just 
because it would be homeward. 
I was wrong. I want gr£en grass, 
blue skies and plenty of room to 
move around. I can’t wait.” 

“I can,” said Bertelli, virtuous- 
ly. “Because I’ve got to. If I were 
unable to wait, I’d go nuts.” 
“Would you?” Marsden looked 
him over, the grouch slowly fad- 
ing from his face. The change 
went as far as a chuckle. “How 
much of a trip would that be?” 
Leaving the navigation room, 
he headed toward the galley, still 
chuckling as he went. Rounding 
the farther corner, he let out a 
low guffaw. 

“What’s funny?” asked Ber- 
telli, vacantly mystified. 

Straightening up from the 
screen, Kinrade eyed him with 
care. “How is it that whenever 
somebody starts blowing his — ” 
Changing his mind, he let the 
sentence die out. 

“Yes, Captain?” 



“Oh, forget it.” 

The ship plunged onward, 
moaning at every plate. 

Vail appeared presently, com- 
ing off duty and on his way to 5 

eat. He was a short man of great ’I 

width, with long arms and power- ' 
ful hands.

“Any luck?” 

“We’re not sure.” Kinrade in- 
dicated the dot burning amid a 
confusing host of others. “Mars- 
den thinks that’s it. He may be 
wrong.” 

“Don’t you know?” asked Vail 
looking at him and ignoring the 



screen Kinrade was pointing to. 

“We will in due time. It’s a bit 
early yet.” 

“Changing your tune, aren’t 
you?” 

“What do you mean?” Kin- 
rade’s tone was sharp. 

“Three days ago you told us 
that Sol should become visible 
in the screen almost any time. 
That gave us a lift. We needed 
it. I’m no sniveling babe myself, 
but I must admit I wanted that 
boost.” He surveyed the other 
with a touch of resentment. “The 
higher hopes go, the lower they 
fall when they drop.” 

“I’m not dropping mine,” Kin- 
rade said. “Three days plus or 
minus is a tiny margin of error 
in a return trip taking two years.” 

“That would be true if we’re 
on correct course. Maybe we 
aren’t.” 

“Are you suggesting that I’m 
not competent to work out the 
proper coordinates?” 

“I’m suggesting that even the 
best of us can blunder,” Vail gave 
back stubbornly. “In proof of 
which, two ships have gone to 
pot.” 

“Not because of navigational 
errors,” put in Bertelli, looking 
unconvincingly profound. 

Pursing his lips, Vail stared at 
him and inquired, “What the hell 
do you know about space navi- 
gation?” 

“Nothing,” Bertelli confessed 



with the air of one surrendering 
a back tooth. He nodded toward 
Kinrade. “But he knows enough.” 

“I wonder!” 

HE route for return was J 
worked out in full detail by 
Captain Sanderson before he 
died,” said Kinrade, his color a 
little heightened. “I’ve checked i 
and rechecked at least a dozen 1 
times. So has Marsden. If you’re ; 
not satisfied, you can have the * 
calculations and go through them 
yourself.” \ 

“I’m not a trained navigator.” 
“Then shut your trap and 
leave other — ” 

Bertelli broke in with a note of J 
protest. “But I didn’t have it J 
open!” | 

Shifting attention to him, Kin- j 
rade asked, “You didn’t have J 
what open?” - | 

“My mouth,” said Bertelli. He 1 
registered personal injury. “Don’t -j 
know why you have to pick on -j 
me. Everyone picks on me.” | 
“You’re wrong,” Vail told him, 
“He—” | 

“There you are. I’m wrong. I 
I’m always wrong. I’m never J 
right.” Emitting a deep sigh, Ber- 
telli wandered out, dragging big 
feet. His face was a picture of < 
misery. , i 

Vail watched him in faint ' 
amazement, then said, “That 
looks to me like a persecution ! 
complex. And he’s supposed to 




144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



be a psychologist. What a 
laugh!” 

“Yes,” agreed Kinrade, with- 
out humor. “What a laugh!” 

Going to the screen, Vail ex- 
amined it. “Which one does 
Marsden think is Sol?” 

“That one.” Kinrade pointed it 
out for him. 

Staring at it hungrily for quite 
a time, Vail finished, “Oh, well, 
let’s hope he’s right.” Then he 
departed. 

Left alone, Kinrade sat in the 
navigator’s chair and looked at 
the screen without seeing it. His 
mind was on a problem that 
might be real or might be imag- 
inary. 

When does science become an 
art? Or should it be: when does 
art become a science? 

A RAM cracked next day. He 
got a dose of “Charlie,” the 
same psychotic behavior pattern 
that had put an end to Weygarth. 
There was a technical name for 
it, but few knew it and fewer 
could pronounce it. The slang 
term came from an ancient, al- 
most forgotten war in which the 
rear-gunner of a big aircraft— 
Tail End Charlie— would think 
too long of the heavy bomb-load 
and the thousands of gallons of 
high octane spirit right behind 
his perspex parrot-cage, and all 
of a sudden he’d batter upon the 
walls of his prison, screaming, 

A LITTLE Ol L 



The way Aram broke was 
characteristic of this space afflic- 
tion. He sat next to Nilsen, quiet- 
ly downing his meal, but picking 
at the compartmented plastic 
tray as though completely indif- 
ferent to food or drink. Then, 
without a word or the slightest 
change of expression, he pushed 
away the tray, got up and ran 
like hell. Nilsen tried to trip him 
and failed. Aram shot through the 
door like a bolting rabbit, raced 
headlong down the passage to - 
ward the airlock. 

Slamming his own chair back 
to the limit of its holding rails, 
Nilsen went after him with Kin- 
rade one jump behind. BertelU 
stayed in his seat, a forkful of 
food halfway to his mouth, his 
gaze fixed blankly on the facing 
wall while his big ears remained 
perked for outer sounds. 

They caught Aram frantically 
struggling with the airlock wheel 
and trying to force it the wrong 
way around. Even if he had ro- 
tated it the right way, he 
wouldn’t have had time to open 
it. His thin features were pale 
and he was snuffling with exer- 
tion. 

Reaching him, Nilsen jerked 
him around by one shoulder, 
smacked him in the jaw. There 
was plenty of force behind that 
blow. Aram, a small, lightly 
built man, caromed along the 
passage and ended up as an un- 



145 



conscious bundle by the forward 
door. Rubbing his knuckles, Nil- 
sen grunted to himself, checked 
the airlock wheel to make sure 
if was holding good and tight. 

Then he grasped the -victim’s 
feet while Kinrade lifted the 
shoulders and between them they 
bore the sagging Aram to his tiny 
cabin, laid him in his bunk. Nil- 
sen remained on watch while 
Kinrade went for the hypodermic 
needle and a shot of dope. They 
put Aram out of the running for 
the next twelve hours. This was 
the only known countermeasure: 
an enforced sleep during which 
an overactive brain could rest 
and strained nerves recuperate. 

Returning to the galley, Nilsen 
resumed his interrupted meal, 
said to Kinrade, “Good thing he 
didn’t think to swipe a gun.” 

Kinrade nodded without an- 
swering. He knew what the other 
meant. Weygarth had tried to 
bold them off with a gun. while 
he prepared his dash to false 
freedom on a blast of air. They 
could not rush him without risk- 
ing serious loss. They’d had to 
shoot him down quickly, ruth- 
lessly, before it was too late. 
Weygarth had been their first 
bitter casualty only twenty 
months out. 

And now they dared not suffer 



minimum. Four would be damn- 
ed forever to a great metal coffin 
thundering blindly amid the host 
of stars. 

It brought up yet another of 
the problems that Kinrade had 
not been able to resolve, at least 
to his own satisfaction. Should 
an airlock be fastened with a real 
lock to which only the captain 
held the key? Or might that cost 
them dear in a sudden and grave 
emergency? Which was the great- 
er risk, lunatic escape for one or 
balked escape for all? • 

Oh, well, they were homeward 
bound, and when they got back 
he’d hand over the log and the 
detailed reports and leave the 
big brains to work it out for 
themselves. That was their job; 
his to make landfall safely. 

K INRADE glanced at Nilsen, 
noted the introspective frown 
on his face and knew that he was 
thinking of Weygarth. Scientists 
and top-grade technicians are 
people with highly trained minds, 
but that does not make them less 
or more than other men. Their 
status does not keep them in 
splendid isolation from humanity. 
Outside of their especial interests, 
they are plain, ordinary folk sub- 
ject to the strains and tensions of 
every man. Their minds are not 



another loss. Five men could run and cannot be solely and,ever- 
the ship, control it, steer it, land lastingly 1 occup/ed with one sub- 
it. Five represented the absolute ject. Sometimfcs they think of 

146 GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



other men and sometimes of 
themselves. Nilsen’s was a train- 
ed mind, intelligent and sensitive, 
therefore so much the more liable 
to crack. Kinrade knew instinc- 
tively that if and when Nilsen 
made a break for the lock, he 
would not forget the gun. 

It took less intelligent, less 
imaginative types — the cow-mind 
—to endure long incarceration in 
a huge steel boiler on which a 
dozen devils hammered hour after 
hour, day after day, without cease 
or let-up. There was another 
problem for Earth’s bigbrains to 
mull a' while : dull-witted people 
were tops for endurance, but use- 
less functionally. Bright minds 
were essential to run the ship, 
yet somewhat more likely to go 
phut , even though only tempo- 
rarily. 

What did this add up^to? An- 
swer: the ideal space crew should 
be composed of hopeless slopes 
with high I. Q. A contradiction 
in, terms. 

Now that he came to consider 
it,- the thought struck him that 
here might be the solution to the 
mystery of Bertelli. Those who 
had designed and built the ship 
and hand-pjcked the crew were 
people of formidable craftiness. 
It was incredible that they’d dig . 
up a gormless character like Ber- 
telli in a spirit of not giving a 
damn. The selection had been 
deliberate and carefully calcu- 



lated, of that Kinrade was cer- 
tain. Perhaps the loss of two ships 
had convinced them that they’d 
have to be more modest in their 
choice of crews. Maybe Bertelli 
had been planted to test how a 
dope made out. 

If so, they had something — but 
it wasn’t enough. Without a 
doubt, Bertelli would be the last 
to crack, the last to race for the 
airlock. Beyond that, nothing 
could be said in his favor purely 
from the technical viewpoint. He 
knew little worth knowing and 
that he had learned from the 
others. Any responsibility with 
which he was entrusted invari- 
ably got bollixed in masterly 
style. Indeed, with his big, clumsy 
mitts on any of the controls, he 
would be a major menace. 

He was liked, all right. In fact, 
he was popular in a way. Ber- 
telli had other accomplishments 
about as genuinely useful on a 
.spaceship as a skunk’s smell-gun 
at a cdhvention. He'' could play 
several musical instruments, sing 
in a cracked voice, mime in real- 
ly funny manner, tap-dance with 
a peculiar sort of loose-jointed 
clumsiness. After they’d got over 
their initial irritation with him, 
they had found him amusing and 
pathetic — a bumbler they were 
sorry to feel superior to, because 
they couldn’t think of anyone 
who wouldn’t be superior to him.

would learn that a spaceship is 
better without non-technical 
thickheads, Kinrade decided 
rather uncertainly. They had 
made their test and it hadn’t 
come off. It hadn’f come off. It 
hadn’t come off. The more he re- 
peated it to himself, the less sure 
he felt about it. 

Vail came in, paused at the 
sight of them. “I thought you’d 
finished ten minutes ago.” 

“It’s all right.” Nilsen stood up, 
brushed away crumbs, gestured 
toward his chair. “I’ll go watch 
the engines.” 

Getting his tray and meal, Vail 
seated himself, eyed the others. 
“What’s up?” 

“Aram’s in bed with Charlie,” 
Kinrade told him. 

Not the flicker of emotion 
crossed Vail’s face. He made a 
vicious stab at his food, said, 
“The Sun would bring him out of 
that condition. That’s what we 
all want, a sight of the Sun.” 

“There are millions of auns,” 
informed Bertelli, eagerly offering 
the lot. 

Leaning his elbows on the 
table, Vail said in a harsh voice 
and with great significance, “That 
is precisely the point!” 

Bertelli’s eyes dulled into com- 
plete confusion. He fidgeted with 
his tray, knocked his fork around 
without noticing it. Still looking 
at Vail, he felt for the fork, pick- 
ed it up by the prongs, absently 



poked at the tray with the handle. 
Then he lifted the handle toward 
his mouth. 

“I’d try the other end,” advised 
Vail, watching with interest. “It’s 
sharper.” 

The eyes lowered, studied the 
fork while gradually they took 
on an expression of vacant sur- 
prise. He made a childish motion 
indicative of helplessness. Finally 
he bestowed on both his usual 
apologetic grin and at the same 
time gave a casual twitch of 
finger and thumb that landed the 
handle smack in his palm. 

Kinrade noticed that flip. Vail 
didn’t, but he did — and for once 
he got a strange, uncanny feeling 
that Bertelli had made a very 
small mistake, a tiny error that 
might have passed unseen. 

W HEN Kinrade was in his 
cabim, the intercom called 
on the desk and Marsden’s voice 
said, “Aram’s just come out of it. 
He’s got a sore jaw, but he seems 
cooled down. I don’t think he 
needs another shot — yet,.” 

“We’ll let him run loose, but 
keep an eye on him for a while,” 
Kinrade decided. “Tell Bertelli 
to stick close. He has nothing 
better to do.” 

“All right.” Marsden paused, 
added in lower tones, “Vail is 
pretty surly lately. Have you 
noticed?” 

“He’s okay. Just gets jumpy 



148

now and again. Don’t we all?” 

“I suppose so.” Marsden 
sounded as if he’d like to say 
more, .but he didn’t. He cut off 
and the intercom went silent. 

Finishing the day’s entry on 
the log, Kinrade examined him- 
self at the mirror, decided he’d 
put off a shave a little longer. 
This was his idea of petty lux- 
ury; he disliked the chore, but 
lacked the courage to grow a 
beard. Other men, other notions. 

He lay back in his chair and 
enjoyed a quiet think, first about 
the planet called home, then the 
men who had sent this ship into 
space, then the men who were 
flying it with him. They’d been 
trained for the job, these six who, 
for the first time, had reached 
another, star, and their training 
had incorporated a certain 
amount of useful flexibility. The 
three spacemen among them had 
been given superswift education 
in some branch of science. The 
scientists had undergone courses 
in space navigation or atomic en- 
gineering. Two aptitudes per 
man. Then he thought again and 
eliminated Bertelli. 

Pre-flight education had gone 
further than that. A baldheaded 
old coot who bossed a lunatic 
asylum had lectured them on 
space etiquette with every air of 
knowing what he was talking 
about. Each man, he had explain- 
ed, would know only three things 



about his fellows, to wit: name, 
age and qualification. No man 
must ask for more nor seek to 
pry into another’s private life. 
Unknown lives provide no basis 
for irrational prejudices, antag- 
onisms or insults, he had said. 
Empty personalities don’t clash 
so readily. So it was established 
that none might urge another to 
reveal what made him tick. 

Thus Kinrade could not probe 
the reasons why Vail was ir- 
ritable above the average or what 
made Marsden more impatient 
than others. He could not deter- 
mine from past data why Nilsen 
potentially was the most danger- 
ous or Aram the least stable. 
Neither could he insist that Bert- 
elli explain his presence in under- 
standable terms. Pending success- 
ful completion of the flight, each 
man’s history remained hidden 
behind a curtain through which, 
from time to time only insigni- 
ficant items had been glimpsed. 

After most of four years exist- 
ing cheek by jowl with these 
people, he had * come to know 
them as never before — but not 
as he would know them some 
day in the green fields of Earth 
when the flight was a bygone 
event, the tabu was broken and 
they had memories for free dis- 
cussion. 

He liked to muse on these 
matters because he had devel- 
oped a theory that he intended 



A LITTLE OIL 



149 



to dump right in the laps of the 
experts. It concerned lifers in pen- 
itentiaries. Not all criminals are 
stupid, he believed. Many might 
be intelligent, sensitive men some- 
how pushed or kicked - off the 
path called straight and narrow. 
Walled up, some of them would 
get a dose of Charlie, try to bust 
out, beat up a warder, anything 
anything to escape — and be re- 
warded for their efforts with soli- 
tary confinement. It was like 
treating a poisoned man with an 
even more powerful dose of what 
' had made him ill. It was wrong, 
wrong. He was convinced of that. 
There was a reformist streak in 
Kinrade. 

Upon his desk he had a neatly 
written scheme for the treatment 
of lifers likely to go psycho. It 
involved constant individual ob- 
servation and the timely use of 
occupational therapy. Whether of 
not it was practical, he didn’t 
know, but at least it was con- 
structive. The plan was his pet. 
He wanted leading penologists 
to play with it, give it a serious 
tryout. If it worked — and he felt 
that it should — the world would 
have derived one benefit from 
this flight in a way not originally 
contemplated. Even that alone 
made it profitable. 

A T that point, his thoughts 
were brought to an abrupt 
end by the arrival of Nilsen, 



Vail and Marsden. Behind them, 
waiting in the doorway, but not 
entering, was Aram with Bertelli 
in attendance. Kinrade braced 
himself in his seat and spoke 
gruffly. 

“This is great. Nobody at the 
controls.” 

“I switched on the autopilot,” 
Marsden said. “It will hold her 
on course four or five hours. You 
said so yourself.” 

“True.” His eyes examined 
them. “Well, why the scowling 
deputation?” 

“This is the end of the fourth 
day,” Nilsen pointed out. “Soon 
we’ll be into the fifth. And we’re 
still looking for Sol.” 

“So?” 

“I’m not satisfied that you 
know where we’re going.” 

“I am.” 

“Is that a fact or more face- 
saving?” 

Kinrade stood up, said, “For 
the sake of argument, suppose I 
admitted that we’re running blind 
— what could you do about it?” 

“That’s an easy one.” Nilsen’s 
air was that of one whose sus- 
picions have almost been con- 
firmed. “We picked you for cap- 
tain after Sanderson died. We’d 
withdraw the vote and choose 
somebody else.” 

“And then?” 

“Make for the nearest star, 
hunt around for a planet we can 
live on.” 



150 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Sol is the nearest star.” 

“It is if we’re heading right,” 
Nilsen retorted. 

Sliding open a drawer in his 
desk, Kinrade took out a large 
roll of paper, spread it across the 
top. Its multitude of tiny squares 
bore a large number of dots and 
crosses amid which a thick, black 
line ran in a steady curve. 

“This is the return course.” 
His fingers indicated several 
crosses and dots. “We can tell 
by direct observation of these 
bodies whether or not we are on 
course. There’s only one thing we 
can’t check with absolute accur- 
acy.” 

“What’s that?” inquired Vail, 
frowning at the chart. 

“Our velocity. It can be esti- 
mated only with a five per cent 
margin of error, plus or minus. 
I know we’re on course, but not 
precisely how far along it. Hence 
the four-day lag. I warn you that 
it can extend to as much as ten.” 
Nilsen said, heavily, “They 
took photos of the star forma- 
tion on the way out. We’ve just 
been putting the transparencies 
over the screen. They don’t 
match.” 

“Of course they don’t.” Kin- 
rade displayed impatience. 
“We're not at the same point. 
The star field will have circum- 
ferential displacement.” 

“We aren’t without brains de- 
spite not being trained naviga- 

A LITTLE OIL 



tors;” Nilsen gave back. “There 
is displacement. It progresses 
radially from a focal point that 
is not the pink spot you claim is 
Sol. The point is about halfway 
between that and the left edge of 
the screen.” He gave, a loud sniff, 
invited, “Can you talk yourself 
out of that one?” 

Kinrade sighed, put a finger on 
the chart. “This line is a curve, 
as you can see. The outward 
course was a similar curve bend- 
ing the reverse 'way. The tail 
camera focused along the line 
of the ship’s axis. A few thou- 
sand miles out, it was pointing 
sunward, but the farther the ship 
got, the more its axis pointed to 
one side. By the time we crossed 
the orbit of Pluto, it was aiming 
to hell and away.” 

Peering at the chart, Nilsen 
thought a while, asked shrewdly, 
“If you are sincere, what’s the 
absolute margin of error?” 

“I told you — ten days.” 
“Nearly half of those have 
gone. We’ll give you the other 
half.” 

“Thanks!” said Kinrade, faint- 
ly sarcastic. 

“After which we’ll either see 
Sol and identify it beyond doubt 
or we’ll have a new captain and 
be heading for the nearest light.” 
“We’ll draw lots for captain,” 
suggested Bertelli from the back. 
“I’d like the chance to boss a 
ship.” 

W 



“Heaven help us!” exclaimed 
Marsden. 

“We’ll pick the man best quali- 
fied,” said Nilsen. 

“That’s why ypu chose Kin- 
rade' in the first place"” Bertelli 
reminded Mm. 

“Maybe. But we’ll find some- 
one else.” 

“Then I insist on being con- 
sidered. One dope is as good as 
another for making a mess of 
things.” 

“When it comes to that, we’re 
not in the same class,” replied 
Nilsen, feeling that his efforts 
were being subtly sabotaged. 
“You can out-boob me with your 
big. hands pinned to your big 
ears.” He looked over the others. 
“Isn’t that so?” 

They grinned assent. 

It wasn’t Nilsen’s triumph. It 
was somebody else’s. 

Merely because they did grin, 

B ERTELLI organized another 
party that night. For once his 
birthday was not the pretext. 
Somehow he’d managed to cele- 
brate seven birthdays in four 
years without anyone seeing fit to 
count them all. But an excuse 
can be overdone, so he announced 
his candidacy for the post of 
captain, explaining that he wished 
to curry favor with voters. It was 
as good as any. 

They cleared the galley as 
they’d done a score of times be- 



fore. They broke a bottle of gin, 
shared it between them, sip- 
ped with introspective glumness. 
Aram did his party-piece by bird- 
calling between two fingers, re- 
ceived the usual polite applause. 
Marsden recited something about 
the brown eye of the little yellow 
dog. By that time Nilsen had 
warmed up sufficiently to sing 
two songs in a deep, rich bass. 
He gained louder applause for 
having varied his-repertoire. 

Weygarth, of course, wasn’t 
there to do his sleight-of-hand 
tricks. Sanderson and Dawkins 
were also missing from the bill. 
Temporarily, their absence was 
forgotten as the tiny audience 
awaited the star turn. 

Bertelli, of course. This was the 
sort of thing at which he ex- 
celled and the chief reason why 
a major nuisance had become 
tolerated, liked, perhaps loved. 

When they’d held the alien 
landfall spree, he’d played an 
oboe for most of an hour, doing 
more things with the instrument 
than they had believed possible. 
He had ended with a sonic im- 
pression of an automobile col - 
lision, the agitated toot of horns, 
the crash, the heated argument 
between oboe-voiced drivers tha« 
finished with decidedly rud 
noises. Nilsen had almost rolle < 
out of his seat. 

On the way home, there he 
been a couple more whoopees at

ranged for no reason other than 
the hell of it. Bertelli had mimed 
for those, his dental plates re- 
moved, his features rubbery, his 
arms like snakes. First the eager 
sailor leaping ashore and seeking 
a chance to play his own strump- 
et. The search for talent, the dis- 
covery, pursuit, encounter, rebuff, 
the persuasion, the going to a 
show, the strolling home, the pass 
on the doorstep rewarded with a 
black'eye. 

Another time he’d reversed the 
role, become a plump blonde fol- 
lowed by a hungry sailor. Word- 
lessly, but with motions, gestures, 
posturings and facial expressions 
equal to if not better than speech, 
he had taken them on the night’s 
prowl ending with the fight on 
the doorstep. 

This time he pretended to be a 
bashful sculptor shaping a statue 
of Venus de Milo with invisible 
clay. Piling up a column of what 
wasn’t there, he hesitantly strok- 
ed it, nervously patted it, embar- 
rassedly smoothed it into 
near-visible form. He rolled two 
cannon-balls, plonked them on 
her chest while covering his eyes, 
rolled two pills and shyly put 
them on top, delicately molded 
them into shape, glanced fright- 
enedly around, then bestowed a 
hurried kiss on his own handi- 
work. 

It took him twenty hilarious 
minutes to make her almost, but 

A LITTLE OIL 



not quite, complete, at which 
point he took idiotic alarm. He 
scanned the horizon, looked out 
the door, peered under the table 
-to insure that they two were 
alone. Satisfied yet full of em- 
barrassment, he made a faltering 
approach, withdrew, plucked up 
fresh courage, lost it again, had 
a spasm of daring that failed at 
the critical moment. 

Vail offered pungent advice 
while Nilsen sprawled in the next 
seat and held an aching dia- 
phragm. Summoning up every- 
thing he had in an effort to finish 
the job, Bertelli made a mad rush 
at it, fell over his own feet, slid 
on his face along the steel floor- 
plates. Nilsen made choking 
sounds. Stupidly enraged with 
himself, Bertelli shot to his feet, 
drew his bottom lip over the tip 
of his nose, waggled his bat-ears, 
closed his eyes, made one violent 
stab with a forefinger — and pro- 
vided Vtnus with a navel. 

For days afterward, they 
chuckled over that performance, 
making curvaceous motions with 
their hands or prodding each 
other in the paunch at odd mo- 
ments. The ghostly Venus stayed 
good for a laugh until , . the 
Sun came up. 

Ti/TAKING another of his fre- 
quent checks late in the 
eighth day, Marsden found that 
one of the transparencies now co- 



153 



incided dot for dot with focal .S 
point two inches leftward of an 1 
enlarged pink glow. He let go | 
a howl that brought the rest of | 
the crew racing to the bow. , 

Sol was identified. They looked ! 
at it, licked lips over it, looked •-< 
again. Four years in a bottle is i 
like forty years in the star fields ^ 
— and they had been bottled too ; 
long. One by one they visited 
Kinrade’s cabin and exulted over 
the superstition on tire wall.

THIRD TIME DOES IT!

Morale boosted way up. The » 
ship’s drumming and thrumming j 
somehow lost its hellishness and ! 
took on a heartening note of urg - ■ 

ency. Jangled nerves accepted 
the new and different strain of 




anticipation right to the glorious 
moment when a voice from Earth 
came feebly through the radio 
receiver. The voice strengthened 
day by day, week by week, until 
finally it bawled from the speaker 
while the fore observation-porij. 
was filled with half a planet. 

“From where I’m standing, I 
can see an ocean of faces turned 
toward the sky,” said the an- 
nouncer. “There must be half 
a million people present, sharing 
the most eventful hour in history. 
At any moment now, folks, you 
will hear the distant drone of the 
first spaceship to return from an- 
other star. I just can’t tell you 
how much — ” 

What followed the landing was 
the worst part. The blaring bands, 
the thunder of cheers. The hand-

shakes, speeches, the posing for 
press photographers, newsreels, 
television scanners, the cameras 
of countless frantic amateurs. 

It ended at last. Kinrade said 
farewell to his crew, felt the bear- 
trap grip of Nilsen’s hand, the 
soft, frank clasp of Aram, the shy, 
self-conscious touch of Bertelli. 

Looking into the latter’s 
mournful eyes, he said, “The au- 
thorities will now start howling 
for all the data we’ve got. I 
suppose you’ve finished your 
book.” 

“What book?” 

“Now, now, don’t kid me.” 
He offered a knowing wink. 
“You’re the official psychologist, 
aren’t you?” 

He didn’t wait for an answer. 
While the others busied them- 
selves collecting personal belong- 
ings, he got the log and the file 
pf reports, took them to the Ad- 
ministration Building, 

L OOKING no different for the 
passage of time, Bancroft sat 
paunchily behind his desk, said 
with satirical satisfaction, “You 
are now looking at a fat man wal- 
lowing in the joys of promotion, 
and higher salary.” 

“Congratulations.” Kinrade 
dumped the books and sat down. 

“I would swap both for youth 
and adventure.” Casting an an- 
ticipatory glance at what the 
Other had brought, Bancroft went 



on, “There are questions I’m 
bursting to ask. But the answers 
are hidden somewhere in that pile \ 
and I guess you’re in a hurry to 
go home.” | 

“A ’copter will pick me up 
when it can get through the over- j 
crowded air. I have twenty min-, j 
utes to spare.” 

“In that case I’ll use them” 
Bancroft leaned forward, eyes in- 
tent. “What about the first two ; 
ships?” 1 

“We searched seven planets ] 
Not a sign.” j 

“They hadn’t landed or crash- 
ed?” i 

“No.” ,| 

“So they must have gone on?” j 
“Evidently.” 

“Any idea why?” ; 

Kinrade hesitated, said, “It’s a ] 
hunch and nothing more. I think ; 
their numbers were reduced by 
accident, sickness or whatever. J 
They became too few to retain i 
control of the ship.” He paused, | 
added, “We lost three men our- * 
selves.” i 

“Tough luck.” Bancroft looked 1 
unhappy. “Who were they?” 
“Weygarth, Dawkins and San- : 
derson. The first died on the way j 
out. He never saw the new sun, 
much less his own. The story is 
there.” He gestured toward the 
reports. “The other two were j 
killed on the fourth planet, which l 
I’ve established as unsafe for hu- 
man habitation.”

“What’s wrong with it?” 

“A big and hungry life-form 
exists under the surface, sitting 
with traps held open beneath a 
six-inch crust of soil. Sanderson 
walked around, fell into a red, 
sloppy mouth four feet wide by 
ten long. He was gulped from 
sight. Dawkins rushed to his res- 
cue, but dropped into another.” 
His fingers fumbled with each 
other as he finished, “There was 
nothing we could do, not a 
damned thing.” 

“A pity, a great pity.” Bancroft 
shook his head slowly from side 
to side. “How about the other 
planets?” 

“Four are useless. Two are 
made to measure for us.” 

“Hah, that’s something!” He 
glanced at the small clock on his 
desk, continued hurriedly, “And 
now the ship. Doubtless your re- 
ports are full of criticisms. Noth- 
ing is perfect, not even the best 
we’ve produced. What do you 
consider its most outstanding 
fault?” 

“The noise. It could drive you 
out of your mind. It needs cutting 
out.” 

“Not completely,” Bancroft 
contradicted. “There is psychic 
terror in absolute silence.” 

“All right. Then it needs cut- 
ting down to more endurable 
level. Try it yourself for a week 
and see how you like it.” 

“I wouldn’t. The problem is 



being beaten, although slowly. 
We have a new and quieter type 
of engine already on the test- 
bench. Four years’ progress, you 
know.” 

“We need it,” said Kinrade. 

B ancroft went on, “And 
what do you think of the 
crew?” 

“Best ever.” 

“They ought to be. We skim- 
med the world for the cream- 
nothing less was good enough. 
Each man was tops in his own 
particular line.” 

“Including Bertelli?” 

“I knew you’d ask about him.” 
Bancroft smiled as if at a secret 
thought. “You want me to ex- 
plain him, eh?” 

“I’ve no right to insist, hut I’d 
certainly like to know why you 
included such a dead weight.” 
“We lost two ships,” said 
Bancroft, looking serious. “One 
could be an accident. Two were 
not. It’s hard to believe that .an 
exceptional kind of breakdown 
or a collision with a lump of rock 
or some other million-to-one 
chance would occur twice run- 
ning.” 

“I don’t believe it myself.” 
“We spent years studying the 
problem,” Bancroft continued. 
“Every time we got the same 
answer: it wasn’t due to any 
defect in the vessels. The cause 
lay somewhere in the human ete-

ment. Short of a four-year test 
on living men, we could do no 
more than speculate. Then one 
day the likely solution popped 
up by sheer chance.” 

‘How?” 

“We were in this very room, 
beating our brains for the hun- 
dredth or two-hundredth time, 
when that clock stopped.” He in- 
dicated the timepiece facing him. 
“A fellow named Whittaker from 
the Space Medicine Research Sta- 
tion wound it up, shook it, got it 
going. Immediately afterward a 
brainwave hit him, kerplonk!” 
Picking up the clock, Bancroft 
opened its back, turned it to- 
ward his listener. 

“What do you see?” 

“Cogs and wheels.” 

“Nothing else?” 

“Couple of coiled springs.” 
“Are you sure that is all?” 

“All that matters,” declared 
Kinrade, having no doubt. 

“Wrong, dead wrong,” said 
Bancroft, positively, “You have 
made precisely the mistake we 
made with ships number one and 
two. We built giant metal clocks, 
fitted them with human cogs and 
wheels accurately designed for 
their purpose. Cogs and wheels 
of flesh and blood, chosen with 
, the same care as one would 
choose parts for a, fine watch. 
But the. clocks stopped. We had 
overlooked something that Whit- 
taker suddenly thought of.” 

A MTTLE OIL 



“Well, what was it?” 

Bancroft smiled and said, “A 
little oil.” 

“Oil?” exclaimed Kinrade, sit- 
ting up. 

“Our error was natural. In a 
technological age, we technicians 
tend to think we’re the whole 
cheese. We aren’t. Maybe we’re 
a very considerable slice, but we 
are not the lot. Civilization is 
composed of others also, the 
housewife, the taxi driver, the 
dime store salesgirl, the postman, 
the hospital nurse, the corner cop. 
It would be a hell of a civilization 
built solely on boys pushing studs 
of computor-machines and with- 
out the butcher, the baker, the 
candlestick-maker. That’s a les- 
son some of us needed to learn.” 

“You’ve got something,” Kin- 
rade agreed, “but I don’t know 
what.” 

“We had another problem in 
our laps,” said Bancroft. “What 
sort of oil must you use for 
human cogs and wheels? Answer: 
human oil. What kind of individ- 
ual specializes in being oil?” 

“And you dug up Bertelli?” 

“We did. His family has been 
oil for twenty generations. He is 
the present holder of a great 
tradition — and internationally 
famous.” 

“Never heard of him. I suppose 
he traveled with us under a false 
name?” 

“He went under his own.” 

i$9 



“I didn’t recognize him,” Kin- 
rade persisted, “Neither did any- 
one else. So how can he be 
famous? Or did he have his face 
altered by plastic surgery?” 

“He changed it completely in 
one minute flat.” Getting up, 
Bancroft lumbered to a filing 
cabinet, opened it, sought through 
several folders. Extracting a full- 
plate glossy photography, he slid 
it across the desk. “All he did to 
his face was wash it.” 

Picking up the picture, Kinrade 
stared at the chalk-white features, 
the cone-shaped hat set rakishly 
On a high, false skull, the huge 
eyebrows arched in perpetual sur- 
prise, the red diamonds painted 
around the mournful eyes, the 
grotesque, bulbous nose, the crim- 
son ear-to-ear mouth, the thick 
ruff of lace around the neck. 
“Coco!” 

“The twentieth Coco with 
which this world has been bless- 
ed,” Bancroft confirmed. 

Kinrade had another long look. 
“May I keep this?” 

“Certainly. I can get a thou- 
sand more copies any time I 
’ want.” 

Tr/"INRADE emerged from the 
Administration Building just 
in time to see the subject of his 
thoughts in hot pursuit of a 
ground-taxi. 

With a shapeless and hurriedly 
packed bag swinging wildly from 



one hand, Bertelli went along in 
exaggerated, loose .-jointed bounds 
with big boots rising waist-high, 
while his long neck protruded 
forward and his face bore a 
ludicrous expression of woe. 

Many a time the onlooker had 
been puzzled by the fleeting 
familiarity of one of Bertelli's 
poses or gestures. Now, knowing 
what he did know, he recognized 
instantly the circus jester’s classic 
anxiety-gallop across a sawdust 
ring. To make it complete, Ber- 
telli should have been casting 
frightened glances over one shoul- 
der at a floating skeleton attached 
to him by a long cord. 

Bertelli caught up with the taxi, 
bestowed an inane smile, slung 
his bag inside and clambered after 
it. The taxi whirled away with 
twin spurts of vapor from its 
underbody jets. 

For a long minute, Kinrade 
stood looking absently at the 
poised spaceships and the sky. 
His mind was viewing the world 
as a gigantic stage on which every 
man, woman and child played a 
wonderful and necessary part. 

And holding the whole show to- 
gether with laughter, exaggerat-
