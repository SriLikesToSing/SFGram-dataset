IF • Editorial 



W E don’t know what a tit- 
tle is and (please!) we 
don't want to know. It just 
seems to go along pretty well 
with Jots. 

Beating the breeze with our 
bearded Feature Editor the 
other day, and he came up 
with an interesting thought 
about your letters. He was 
mulling over the fact — if it is 
a fact — that there hasn’t been 
a really brilliant new s-f au- 
thor in a dozen years. He says 
he doesn’t agree with this 
completely, but somebody said 
it at a Conference. Back in 
what Sam Moskowitz calls the 
Golden Age of S-F— 1939-’42, 
good authors appeared out of 
nowhere in gross lots : d’fcl 

Key, Heinlein, Simak,' Lein- 



ster, Don A. Stuart, Ray Brad- 
bury, Jerome Bixby and 
plenty more, all in a matter of 
months. Our bearded F. E. 
wondered if the letter col- 
umns of the day had anything 
to do with it. 

You’d be surprised how 
many of that bumper crop 
used to write to the magazines 
months and years before they 
sold stories to them. Did the 
writing of those letters turn 
them into good authors, or at 
least toward authorship? Or 
did they write just because 
they were writers? Our B.F.E. 
had no opinion on that; but 
one thing he did point out was 
that the letters they wrote 
were, more often than not, 
crackling with humor and 



5 





loaded with information. 
There was many a good- 
natured fist-fight in those col- 
umns, and a lot of highly mis- 
cellaneous matters got 
thrashed out. 

We wagged our editorial 
head and told the B.F.E. that 
some readers nowadays com- 
plain that letter columns are 
just plain dull. And we added 
that when Galaxy put it to a 
vote, the majority said — no 
letters. Well, said the B.F.E. 
scratching his head (with his 
beard ; he has talent, you 
know) maybe they say that be- 
cause it’s true. And if it’s true, 
all anyone has to do is to write 
bright, sparkling letters. Then 
the column won’t be dull, peo- 
ple will read it, more will 
write to it. And maybe, the 
B.F.E. added thoughtfully, 
maybe after a few months of 
sharpening their wits against 
one another, there’ll be a 
whole explosion of good new 
writers who can bounce from 
the letter pages in . the back to 
the bill-of-fare up front. 

Just a thought, he said. 

W E don’t know quite what 
to do with the thought, 
so we pass it on to you. 

Speaking of the B.F.E., by 
the way, who says his name 
(this week anyway) is Theo- 
dore Sturgeon, be it known, if 
you don’t know it already, that 
he is to be the Guest of Honor 
at the Chicon II, which is the 
World Science Fiction Con- 
vention to be held at the Pick- 
Congress Hotel in Chicago, 



next Labor Day weekend. 
Memberships ($2) and infor- 
mation can be had from 
George W. Price, Treasurer, 
P.O. Box 4864, Chicago 80, 
which is still in Illinois. The 
B.F.E. is honored, IF is hon- 
ored, and you ought to try to 
make it because it’s going to 
be one big beautiful bash. 

A writer friend of ours re- 
ports that he was faced recent- 
ly with a writer’s dream: the 
sight of a total stranger in a 
diner eating slowly and raptly 
reading one of this writer’s 
books. Our hero pinched him- 
self to see if he was awake, 
and he was ; he sat quiet 
awhile and pondered which of 
many delectable ways and 
means he might use to start 
the conversation which would 
have to reach the wonderful, 
‘‘You mean you wrote this?” 
and the quite-casual, ‘‘Why, 
yes, it happens I did.” 

Deciding at last on the dou- 
ble-reverse, or hyperbolic ap- 
proach, the writer leaned over 
to the diner and said, ‘‘Hey, 
Mac, what you want to read 
that kind of junk for?” 

The diner slowly closed the 
book and gazed at it as if he’d 
never really seen it before. 
Then he nodded and said, “I 
think you got something 
there,” tipped the book off the 
counter onto the floor, ate the 
rest of his French apple pie 
and left without looking back. 

We don’t quite know what 
to do with this story either, so 
you can have it too.

Retief knew the importance of sealed orders 

and the need to keep them that way!

RETIEF 

OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN 



44TT*S true,” Consul Pass- 
Awyn said, requested as- 
signment as principal officer 
at a small post. But I had in 
mind one of those charming 
resort worlds, with only an 
occasional visa problem, or 
perhaps a distressed space- 
man or two a year. Instead, 
I'm zoo-keeper to these con- 
founded settlers. And not for 
one world, mind you, but 
eight!” He stared glumly at 
Vice-Consul Retief. 

“Still,” Retief said, “it gives 
an opportunity to travel — ” 
“Travel !” the consul barked. 
“I hate travel. Here in this 
backwater system particular- 
ly — ” He paused, blinked at 
Retief and cleared his throat. 
“Not that a bit of travel isn^t 
an excellent thing for a junior 



officer. Marvelous experi- 
ence.” 

He turned to the wall-screen 
and pressed a button. A sys- 
tem triagram appeared : eight 
luminous green dots arranged 
around a larger disk repre- 
senting the primary. He 
picked up a pointer, indicat- 
ing the innermost planet. 

“The situation on Adobe is 
nearing crisis. The confound- 
ed settlers — a mere handful of 
them — have managed, as usual, 
to stir up trouble with an in- 
telligent indigenous life form, 
the Jaq. I can't think why 
they bother, merely for a few 
oases among the endless des- 
erts. However I have, at last, 
received authorization from 
Sector Headquarters to take 
certain action.” He swixng 



7 





back to face Retief. ‘‘I’m send- 
ing you in to handle the situa- 
tion, Retief — under sealed or- 
ders.” He picked up a fat buff 
envelope. “A pity they didn’t 
see fit to order the Terrestrial 
settlers out weeks ago, as I 
suggested. Now it is too late. 
I’m expected to produce a mir- 
acle — a rapprochement be- 
tween Terrestrial and Adoban 
and a division of territory. 
It’s idiotic. However, failure 
would look very bad in my 
record, so I shall expect re- 
sults.” 

He passed the buff envelope 
across to Retief. 

“I understood that Adobe 
was uninhabited,” Retief said, 
“until the Terrestrial settlers 
arrived.” 

“Apparently, that was an 
erroneous impression.” Pass- 
wyn fixed Retief with a 
watery eye. “You’ll follow 
your instructions to the letter. 
In a delicate situation such as 
this, there must be no impul- 
sive, impromptu element intro- 
duced. This approach has been 
worked out^in detail at Sec- 
tor. You need merely imple- 
ment it. Is that entirely 
clear?” 

“Has anyone at Headquar- 
ters ever visited Adobe?” 

“Of course not. They all 
hate travel. If there are no 
other questions, you’d best be 
on your way. The mail run de- 
parts the dome in less than an 
hour.” 

“What’s this native life 
form like?” Retief asked, get- 
ting to his feet. 



“When you get back,” said 
Passwyn, “you tell me.” 

T he mail pilot, a leathery 
veteran with quarter-inch 
whiskers, spat toward a 
stained corner of the compart- 
ment, leaned close to the 
screen. 

“They’s shootin’ goin’ on 
down there,” he said. “See 
them white puffs over the 
edge of the desert?” 

“I’m supposed to be pre- 
venting the war,” said Retief. 
“It looks like I’m a little 
late.” 

The pilot’s head snapped 
around. “War?” he yelped. 
“Nobody told me they was a 
war goin’ on on ’Dobe. If 
that’s what that is, I’m gettin’ 
out of here.” 

“Hold on,” said Retief. “I’ve 
got to get down. They won’t 
shoot at you.” 

“They shore won’t, sonny. 
I ain’t givin’ ’em the chance.” 
He started punching keys on 
the console. Retief reached 
out, caught his wrist. 

“Maybe you didn’t hear me. 
I said I’ve got to get down.” 
The pilot plunged against 
the restraint, swung a punch 
that Retief blocked casually. 
“Are you nuts?” the pilot 
screeched. “They’s plenty 
shootin’ goin’ on fer me to see 
it fifty miles out.” 

“The mail must go through, 
you know.” 

“Okay! You’re so dead set 
on gettin’ killed, you take the 
skiff. I’ll tell ’em to pick up 
the remains next trip.’*

“You’re a pal. I’ll take your 
offer.’' 

The pilot jumped to the 
lifeboat hatch and cycled it 
open. “Get in. We’re closin’ 
fast. Them birds might take 
it into their heads to lob one 
this way. .” 

Retief crawled into the nar- 
row cockpit of the skiff, 
glanced over the controls. The 
pilot ducked out of sight, 
came back, handed Retief a 
heavy old-fashioned power 
pistol. “Long as you’re goin’ 
in, might as well take this.” 

“Thanks.” Retief shoved the 
pistol in his belt. “I hope 
you’re wrong.” 

“I’ll see they pick you up 
when the shootin’s over — one 
way or another.” 

The hatch clanked shut. A 
moment later there was a jar 
as the skiff dropped away, 
followed by heavy buffeting 
in the backwash from the de- 
parting mail boat. Retief 
watched the tiny screen, hands 
on the manual controls. He 
was dropping rapidly: forty 
miles, thirty-nine. 

A crimson blip showed on 
the screen, moving out. 

Retief felt sweat pop out on 
his forehead. The red blip 
meant heavy radiation from a 
warhead. Somebody was play- 
ing around with an outlawed 
but by no means unheard of 
fission weapon. But maybe it 
was just on a high trajectory 
and had no connection with 
the skiff. 

Retief altered course to the 
south. The blip followed. 



He checked instrument 
readings, gripped the controls, 
watching. This was going to 
be tricky. The missile bored 
closer. At five miles Retief 
threw the light skiff into max- 
imum acceleration, straight to- 
ward the oncoming bomb. 
Crushed back in the padded 
seat, he watched the screen, 
correcting course minutely. 
The proximity fuse should be 
set for no more than 1000 
yards. 

At a combined speed of two 
miles per second, the skiff 
flashed past the missile, and 
Retief was slammed violently 
against the restraining har- 
ness in the concussion of the 
explosion. .a mile astern, and 
harmless. 

Then the planetary surface 
was rushing up with frighten- 
ing speed. Retief shook his 
head, kicked in the emergency 
retro-drive. Points of light 
arced up from the planet face 
below. If they were ordinary 
chemical warheads the skiff’s 
meteor screens should handle 
them. The screen flashed bril- 
liant white, then went dark. 
The skiff flipped on its back. 
Smoke filled the tiny com- 
partment. There was a series 
of shocks, a final bone-shak- 
ing concussion, then stillness, 
broken by the ping of hot 
metal contracting. 

C OUGHING, Retief disen- 
gaged himself from the 
shock-webbing. He beat out 
sparks in his lap, groped un- 
derfoot for the hatch and

S 




wrenched it open. A wave of 
hot jungle air struck him. He 
lowered himself to a bed of 
shattered foliage, got to his 
feet. .and dropped flat as a 
bullet whined past his ear. 

He lay listening. Stealthy 
movements were audible from 
the left. 

He inched his way to the 
shelter of a broad-boled dwarf 
tree. Somewhere a song lizard 
burbled. Whining insects cir- 
cled, scented alien life, buzzed 
off. There was another rustle 
of foliage from the under- 
brush five yards away. A bush 
quivered, then a low bough 
dipped. 

Retief edged back around 
the trunk, eased down behind 
a fallen log. A stocky man in 
grimy leather shirt and shorts 
appeared, moving cautiously, a 
pistol in his hand. 

As he passed, Retief rose, 
leaped the log and tackled 
him. 

They went down together. 
The stranger gave one short 
yell, then struggled in silence. 
Retief flipped him onto his 
back, raised a fist — 

“Hey!” the settler yelled. 
“You’re as human as I am!” 
“Maybe I’ll look better after 
a shave,” said Retief. “What’s 
the idea of shooting at me?” 
“Lemme up. My name’s Pot- 
ter. Sorry ’bout that. I figured 
it was a Flap-jack boat ; looks 
just like ’em. I took a shot 
when I saw something move. 
Didn’t know it was a Terres- 
trial. Who are you ? What you 
doin’ here? We’re pretty close 



to the edge of the oasis. That’s 
Flap- jack country over there.” 
He waved a hand toward the 
north, where the desert lay. 

“I’m glad you’re a poor shot. 
That missile was too close for 
comfort.” 

“Missile, eh? Must be Flap- 
jack artillery. We got nothing 
like that.” 

“I heard there was a full- 
fledged war brewing,” said 
Retief. “I didn’t expect — ” 
“Good!” Potter said. “We 
figured a few of you boys 
from Ivory would be joining 
up when you heard. You are 
from Ivory?” 

“Yes. I’m—” 

“Hey, you must be Lemuel’s 
cousin. Good night ! I pretty 
near made a bad mistake. 
Lemuel’s a tough man to ex- 
plain something to.” 

1 m — 

“Keep your head down. 
These damn Flap-jacks have 
got some wicked hand weap- 
ons. Come on...” He moved 
off silently on all fours. Re- 
tief followed. They crossed 
two hundred yards of rough 
country before Potter got to 
his feet, took out a soggy ban- 
dana and mopped his face. 

“You move good for a city 
man. I thought you folks on 
Ivory just sat under those 
domes and read dials. But I 
guess bein’ Lemuel’s cousin 
you was raised different.” 

“As a matter of fact — ” 
“Have to get you some real 
clothes, though. Those city 
duds don’t stand up on ’Dobe.” 
Retief looked down at the 



10 



by KEITH LAUMER 




charred, torn and sweat- . 
soaked powder-blue blazer and 
slacks. 

‘‘This outfit seemed pretty 
rough-and-ready back home/’ 
he said. “But I guess leather 
has its points.” 

“Let’s get on back to camp. 
We’ll just about make it by 
sundown. And,* look. Don’t say 
anything to Lemuel about me 
thinking you were a Flap- 
jack.” 

“I won’t, but — ” 

Potter was on his way, lop- 
ing off up a gentle slope. Re- 
tief pulled off the sodden 
blazer, dropped it over a bush, 
added his string tie and fol- 
lowed Potter. 

II 

4^TJj^E’RE damn glad you’re 
here, mister,” said a fat 
man with two revolvers belted 
across his paunch. “We can 
use every hand. We’re in bad 
shape. We ran into the Flap- 
jacks three months ago and we 
haven’t made a smart move 
since. First, we thought they 
were a native form we hadn’t 
run into before. Fact is, one of 
the boys shot one, thinkin’ it 
was fair game. I guess that 
was the start of it.” He stirred 
the fire, added a stick. 

“And then a bunch of ’em 
hit Swazey’s farm here,” Pot- 
ter said. “Killed two of his 
cattle, and pulled back.” 

“I figure they thought the 
cows were people,” said Swaz- 
ey. “They were out for re- 
venge.” 



“How could anybody think a 
cow was folks?” another man 
put in. “They don’t look noth- 
in’ like — ” 

“Don’t be so dumb, Bert,” 
said Swazey. “They’d never 
seen Terries before. They 
know better now.” 

Bert chuckled. “Sure do. 
We showed ’em the next time, 
didn’t we. Potter? Got four.” 

“They walked right up to 
my place a couple days after 
the first time,” Swazey said, 
“We were ready for ’em. Pep- 
pered ’em good. They cut and 
run.” 

“Flopped, you mean. Ugliest 
lookin’ critters you ever saw. 
Look just like a old piece 
of dirty blanket humpin’ 
around.” 

“It’s been goin’ on this way 
ever since. They raid and then 
we raid. But lately they’ve 
been bringing some big stuff 
into it. They’ve got some kind 
of pint-sized airships and 
automatic rifles. We’ve lost 
four men now and a dozen 
more in the freezer, waiting 
for the med ship. We can’t af- 
ford it. The colony’s got less 
than three hundred able-bod- 
ied men.” 

“But we’re hanging onto our 
farms,” said Potter. “All these 
oases are old sea-beds — a mile 
deep, solid topsoil. And 
there’s a couple of hundred 
others we haven’t touched yet. 
The Flap-jacks won’t get ’em 
while there’s a man alive.” 

“The whole system needs 
the food we can raise,” Bert 
said. “These farms we’re try-

ing to start won’t be enough 
but they’ll help.” 

“We been yellin’ for help 
to the CDT, over on Ivory,” 
said Potter. “But you know 
these Embassy stooges.” 

“We heard they were send- 
ing some kind of bureaucrat 
in here to tell us to get out 
and give the oases to the Flap- 
jacks,” said Swazey. He tight- 
ened his mouth. “We’re wait- 
in’ for him. 

“Meanwhile we got rein- 
forcements cornin’ up, eh, 
boys?” Bert winked at Re- 
tief. “We put out the word 
back. home. We all got rela- 
tives on Ivory and Verde.” 
“Shut up, you damn fool!” 
a deep voice grated. 

“Lemuel !” Potter said. “No- 
body else could sneak up on 
us like that.” 

“If I’d a been a Flap-jack; 
I’d of et you alive,” the new- 
comer said, moving into the 
ring of fire, a tall, broad-faced 
man in grimy leather. He eyed 
Retief. 

“Who’s that?” 

“What do ya mean?” Potter 
spoke in the silence. “He’s 
your cousin. .” 

“He ain’t no cousin of 
mine,” Lemuel said slowly. He 
stepped to Retief. 

. “Who you s p y i n’ for, 
stranger?” he rasped. 

R etief got to his feet. “i 
think I should explain — ” 
A short-nosed automatic ap- 
peared in Lemuel’s hand, a 
clashing note against his 
fringed buckskins.. 



“Skip the talk. I know a 
fink when I see one.” 

“Just for a change, I’d like 
to finish a sentence,” said Re- 
tief. “And I suggest you put 
your courage tock in your 
pocket before it bites you.” 
“You talk too damned fancy 
to suit me.” 

“Maybe. But I’m talking to 
suit me. Now, for the last time, 
put it away.” 

Lemuel stared at Retief. 
“You givin’ me orders. ?” 
Retief’s left fist shot out, 
smacked Lemuel’s face dead 
center. He stumbled back, 
blood starting from his nose; 
the pistol fired into the dirt 
as he dropped it. He caught 
himself, jumped for Retief. 
and met a straight right that 
snapped him onto his back: 
out cold. 

“Wow!” said Potter. “The 
stranger took Lem... in two 
punches !” 

“One,” said Swazey. “That 
first one was just a love tap.” 
Bert froze. “Hark, boys,” he 
whispered. In the sudden si- 
lence a night lizard called. 
Retief strained, heard noth- 
ing. He narrowed his eyes, 
peered past the fire — 

With a swift lunge he 
seized up the bucket of drink- 
ing water, dashed it over the 
fire, threw himself flat. He 
heard the others hit the dirt a 
split second behind him. 

“You move fast for a city 
man,” breathed Swazey beside 
him. “You see pretty good too. 
We’ll split and take ’em from 
two sides. You and Bert from

the left, me and Potter from 
the right/' 

'^No," said Retief. ‘^You 
wait here. I'm going out 
alone." 

"What's the idea! . 

"Later. Sit tight and keep 
your eyes open/' Retief took 
a bearing on a treetop faintly 
visible against the sky and 
started forward. 

F ive minutes' stealthy prog- 
ress brought him to a slight 
rise of ground. With infinite 
caution he raised himself, 
risking a glance over an out- 
cropping of rock. 

The stunted trees ended 
just ahead. Beyond, he could 
make out the dim contour of 
rolling desert. Flap-jack coun- 
try. He got to his feet, clam- 
bered over the stone — still hot 
after a day of tropical heat — 
and moved forward twenty 
yards. Around him he saw 
nothing but drifted sand, pale- 
ly visible in the starlight, and 
the occasional shadow of jut- 
ting shale slabs. Behind him 
the jungle was still. 

He sat down on the ground 
to wait. 

It was ten minutes before a 
movement caught his eye. 
Something had separated it- 
self from a dark mass of stone, 
glided across a few yards of 
open ground to another shel- 
ter. Retief watched. Minutes 
passed. The shape moved 
again, slipped into a shadow 
ten feet distant. Retief felt 
the butt of the power pistol 
with his elbow. His guess had 



better be right this time . 

There was a sudden rasp, 
like leather against concrete, 
and a flurry of sand as the 
Flap-jack charged. 

Retief rolled aside, then 
lunged, threw his weight on 
the flopping Flap-jack — a 
yard square, three inches 
thick at the center and all 
muscle. The ray-like creature 
heaved up, curled backward, 
its edge rippling, to stand on 
the flattened rim of its encir- 
cling sphincter. It scrabbled 
with prehensile fringe-tenta- 
cles for a grip on Retief's 
shoulders. He wrapped his 
arms around the alien and 
struggled to his feet. The 
thing was heavy. A hundred 
pounds at least. Fighting as 
it was, it seemed more like 
five hundred. 

The Flap-jack reversed its 
tactics, went limp. Retief 
grabbed, felt a thumb slip into 
an orifice — 

The alien went wild. Retief 
hung on, dug the thumb in 
deeper. 

"Sorry, fellow," he muttered 
between clenched teeth. "Eye- 
gouging isn't gentlemanly, but 
it's effective. " 

The Flap-jack fell still, only 
its fringes rippling slowly. 
Retief relaxed the pressure of 
his thumb; the alien gave a 
tentative jerk; the thumb dug 
in. 

The alien went limp again, 
waiting. 

*‘Now we understand each 
other," said Retief. "Take me 
to your leader.*' 



RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN 



13 




T wenty minutes’ walk 
into the desert brought Re- 
tief to a low rampart of thorn 
branches: the Flap-jacks’ out- 
er defensive line against Ter- 
ry forays. It would be as good 
a place as any to wait for the 
move by the Flap-jacks. He 
sat down and eased the weight 
of his captive off his back, but 
kept a firm thumb in place. If 
his analysis of the situation 
was correct, a Flap-jack picket 
should be along before too 
long. 

A penetrating beam of red 
light struck Retief in the face, 
blinked off. He got to his feet. 
The captive Flap-jack rippled 
its fringe in an agitated way. 
Retief tensed his thumb in the 
eye-socket. 

‘‘Sit tight,” he said. “Don’t 
try to do anything hasty...’* 
His remarks were falling on 
deaf ears— or no ears at all — 
but the thumb spoke as loudly 
as words. 

There was a slither of sand. 
Another. He became aware of 
a ring of presences drawing 
closer. 

Retief tightened his grip on 
the alien. He could see a dark 
shape now, looming up almost 
to his own six-three. It looked 
like the Flap-jacks came in all 
sizes. 

A low rumble sounded, like 
a deep-throated growl. It 
strummed on, faded out. Re- 
tief cocked his head, frown- 
ing. 

“Try it two octaves higher,” 
he said. 

••Awwrrp ! Sorry, Is that 



better?” a clear voice came 
from the darkness. 

“That’s fine,” Retief said. 
“I’m here to arrange a prisoner 
exchange.” 

“Prisoners? But we have no 
prisoners.” 

“Sure you have. Me. Is it 
a deal?” 

“Ah, yes, of course. Quite 
equitable. What guarantees do 
you require?” 

“The word of a gentleman is 
sufficient.” Retief released 
the alien. It flopped once, dis- 
appeared into the darkness. 

“If you’d care to accompany 
me to our headquarters,” the 
voice said, “we can discuss our 
mutual concerns in comfort.” 

“Delighted.” 

Red lights blinked briefly. 
Retief glimpsed a gap in the 
thorny barrier, stepped 
through it. He followed dim 
shapes across warm sand to a 
low cave-like entry, faintly lit 
with a reddish glow. 

“I must apologize for the 
awkward design of our com- 
fort-dome,” said the voice. 
“Had we known we would be 
honored by a visit — ” 

“Think nothing of it,” Re- 
tief said. “We diplomats are 
trained to crawl.” 

Inside, with knees bent and 
head ducked under the five- 
foot ceiling, Retief looked 
around at the walls of pink- 
toned nacre, a floor like bur- 
gundy-colored glass spread 
with silken rugs and a low 
table of polished red granite 
that stretched down the center 
of the spacious room, set out

with silver dishes and rose- 
crystal drinking-tubes. 

Ill 

CCT ET me congratulate you/' 

-L^the voice said. 

Retief turned. An immense 
Flap-jack, hung with crimson 
trappings, rippled at his side. 
The voice issued from a disk 
strapped to its back. '*You 
fight well. I think we will find 
in each other worthy adver- 
saries." 

“Thanks. I'm sure the test 
would be interesting, but I'm 
hoping we can avoid it." 

“Avoid it?" Retief heard a 
low humming coming from the 
speaker ill the silence. “Well, 
let us dine," the mighty Flap- 
jack said at last. “We can re- 
solve these matters later. I am 
called Hoshick of the Mosaic 
of the Two Dawns." 

“I'm Retief." Hoshick wait- 
ed expectantly, “...of the 
Mountain of Red Tape," Re- 
tief added. 

“Take place, Retief," said 
Hoshick. “I hope you won’t 
find our rude couches uncom- 
fortable." Two other large 
Flap-jacks came into the room, 
communed silently with Ho- 
shick. “Pray forgive our lack 
of translating devices," he 
said to Retief. “Permit me to 
introduce my colleagues..." 

A small Flap-jack rippled 
the chamber bearing on its 
back a silver tray laden with 
aromatic food. The waiter 
served the four diners, filled 
the drinking tubes with yel- 



low wine. It smelled good. 

“I trust you’ll find these 
dishes palatable,” said Ho- 
shick. “Our metabolisms are 
much alike, I believe." Retief 
tried the food. It had a deli- 
cious nut-like flavor. The 
wine was indistinguishable 
from Chateau d'Yquem. 

“It was an u n e x p e c t e d 
pleasure to encounter your 
party here,” said Hoshick. “I 
confess at first we took you 
for an indigenous earth-grub- 
bing form, but we were soon 
disabused of that notion." He 
raised a tube, manipulating it 
deftly with his fringe tenta- 
cles. Retief returned the sa- 
lute and drank. 

“Of course," Hoshick con- 
tinued, “as soon as we realized 
that you were sportsmen like 
ourselves, we attempted to 
make amends by providing a 
bit of activity for you. We’ve 
ordered out our heavier equip- 
ment and a few trained skir- 
mishers and soon we’ll be able 
to give you an adequate show. 
Or so I hope.” 

“Additional skirmishers?" 
said Retief. “How many, if 
you don't mind my asking?" 

“For the moment, perhaps 
only a few hundred. There- 
after. .well, I'm sure we can 
arrange that between us. Per- 
sonally T would prefer a con- 
test of limited scope. No nu- 
clear or radiation-effect weap- 
ons. Such a bore, screening the 
spawn for deviations. Though 
I confess we've come upon 
some remarkably useful 
sports. The rangerform such 



RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN

as you made captive, for ex- 
ample. Simple-minded, of 
course, but a fantastically 
keen tracker.” 

“Oh, by all means,” Retief 
said. “No atomics. As you 
pointed out, spawn-sorting is 
a nuisance, and then too, it’s 
wasteful of troops.” 

“Ah, well, they are after all 
expendable. But we agree : no 
atomics. -Have you tried the 
ground-gwack eggs? Rather 
a specialty of my Mosaic. , .” 
“Delicious,” said Retief. “I 
wonder. Have you considered 
eliminating weapons altogeth- 
er?” 

A scratchy sound issued 
from the disk. “Pardon 
my laughter,” Hoshick said, 
“but surely you jest?” 

“As a matter of fact,” said 
Retief, “we ourselves seldom 
use weapons.” 

“I seem to recall that our 
first contact of skirmishforms 
involved the use of a weapon 
by one of your units.” 

“My apologies,” said Retief. 
“The — ah — the skirmishform 
failed to recognize that he was 
dealing with a sportsman.” 
“Still, now that we have 
commenced so merrily with 
weapons. ” Hoshick sig- 
nalled and the servant refilled 
tubes. 

“There is an aspect I haven’t 
yet mentioned,” Retief went 
on. “I hope you won’t take this 
personally, but the fact is, our 
skirmishforms think of weap- 
ons as son^ething one em- 
ploys only in dealing with 



certain specific life-forms.” 
“Oh? Curious. What forms 
are those?” 

“Vermin. Or Varmints’ as 
some call them. Deadly antag- 
onists, but lacking in caste. I 
don’t want our skirmishforms 
thinking of such worthy ad- 
versaries as yourself as var- 
mints.” 

“Dear me ! I hadn’t realized, 
of course. Most considerate of 
you to point it out.” Hoshick 
clucked in dismay. “I see that 
skirmishforms are much the 
same among you as with us: 
lacking in perception.” He 
laughed scratchily. “Imagine 
considering us as — what was 
the word? — varmints.” 

“Which brings us to the 
crux of the matter. You see, 
we’re up against a serious 
problem with regard to skirm- 
ishforms. A low birth rate. 
Therefore we’ve reluctantly 
taken to substitutes for the 
mass actions so dear to the 
heart of the sportsman. We’ve 
attempted to put an end to 
these contests altogether...” 
Hoshick coughed explosive- 
ly, sending a spray of wine 
into the air. “What are you 
saying?” he gasped. “Are you 
proposing that Hoshick of the 
Mosaic of the Two Dawns 
abandon honor. ?” 

“Sir!” said Retief sternly. 
“You forget yourself. I, Re- 
tief of the Red Tape Moun- 
tain, make an alternate pro- 
posal more in keeping with 
the newest sporting princi- 
ples.” 

“New?” cried Hoshick. “My

dear Retief, what a pleasant 
surprise! I*m enthralled with 
novel modes. One gets so out 
of touch. Do elaborate.” 

‘^It’s quite simple, really. 
Each side selects a representa- 
tive and the two individuals 
settle the issue between them.” 
”1. .um. fear I don’t un- 
derstand. What possible sig- 
nificance could one attach to 
the activities of a couple of 
random skirmishforms?” 

haven’t made myself 
clear,” said Retief. He took a 
sip of wine. ”We don’t in- 
volve the skirmishforms at all. 
That’s quite passe.” 

“You don’t mean. ?” 
“That’s right. You and me.” 

O UTSIDE on the starlit 
sand Retief tossed aside 
the power pistol, followed it 
with the leather shirt Swazey 
had lent him. By the faint 
light he could just make out 
the towering figure of the 
Flap-jack rearing up before 
him, his trappings gone. A si- 
lent rank of Flap-jack retain- 
ers were grouped behind him. 

“I fear I must lay aside the 
translator now, Retief,” said 
Hoshick. He sighed and rip- 
pled his fringe tentacles, “My 
spawn-fellows will never cred- 
it this. Such a curious turn 
fashion has taken. How much 
more pleasant it is to observe 
the action of the skirmish- 
forms from a distance.” 

“I suggest we use Tennessee 
rules,” said Retief. “They’re 
very liberal. Biting, gouging, 
stomping, kneeing and of 



course choking, as well as the 
usual punching, shoving and 
kicking.” 

“Hmmm. These gambits 
seem geared to forms employ- 
ing rigid endo-skeletons ; I 
fear I shall be at a disadvan- 
tage.” 

“Of course,” Retief said, “if 
you’d prefer a more plebeian 
type of contest. .” 

“By no means. But perhaps 
we could rule out tentacle- 
twisting, just to even it.” 

“Very well. Shall we be- 
gin?” 

With a rush Roshick threw 
himself at Retief, who ducked, 
whirled, and leaped on the 
Flap-jack’s back. .and felt 
himself flipped clear by a 
mighty ripple of the alien’s 
slab-like body. Retief rolled 
aside as Hoshick turned on 
him; he jumped to his feet and 
threw a right hay-maker to 
Hoshick’s mid-section. The 
alien whipped his left fringe 
around in an arc that connect- 
ed with Relief’s jaw, sent him 
spinning onto his back... and 
Hoshick’s weight struck him. 

Retief twisted, tried to roll. 
The flat body of the alien 
blanketed him. He worked an 
arm free, drumming blows on 
the leathery back. Hoshick 
nestled closer. 

Retief’s air was running out. 
He heaved up against the 
smothering weight. Nothing 
budged. 

It was like burial under a 
dump-truck-load of concrete. 

He remembered the ranger- 
form lit had captured. The 



RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN 



17 




sensitive orifice had been 
placed ventrally, in what 
would be the thoracic area. 

He groped, felt tough hide 
set with horny granules. He 
would be missing skin tomor- 
row... if there was a tomor- 
row. His thumb found the ori- 
fice and probed. 

The Flap-jack recoiled. Re- 
tief held fast, probed deeper, 
groping with the other hand. 
If the alien were bilaterally 
symmetrical there would be a 
set of ready made hand- 
holds. 

HERE were. 

Retief dug in and the 
Flap-jack writhed, pulled 
away. Retief held on, scram- 
bled to his feet, threw his 
weight against the alien and 
fell on top of him, still goug- 
ing. Hoshick rippled his 
fringe wildly, flopped in ter- 
ror, then went limp. 

Retief relaxed, released his 
hold and got to his feet, 
breathing hard. Hoshick 
humped himself over onto his 
ventral side, lifted and moved 
gingerly over to the sidelines. 
His retainers came forward, 
assisted him into his trap- 
pings, strapped on the trans- 
lator. He sighed heavily, ad- 
justed the volume. 

‘‘There is much to be said 
for the old system,’' he said. 
“What a burden one’s sports- 
manship places on one at 
times.” 

“Great sport, wasn’t it?” 
said Retief. “Now, I know 
you'll be eager to continue. If 

IS 



you’ll just wait while I run 
back and fetch some of our 
gougerforms — ” 

“May hide-ticks devour the 
gougerforms!” Hoshick bel- 
lowed. “You’ve given me such 
a sprong-ache as I’ll remember 
each spawning-time for a 
year.” 

“Speaking of hide-ticks,” 
said Retief, “we’ve developed 
a biterform — ” 

“Enough!” Hoshick roared, 
so loudly that the translator 
bounced on his hide. “Sudden- 
ly I yearn for the crowded 
yellow sands of Jaq. I had 
hoped. .” He broke off, drew 
a rasping breath. “I had 
hoped, Retief,” he said, speak- 
ing sadly now, “to find a new 
land here where I might plan 
my own Mosaic, till these 
alien sands and bring forth 
such a crop of paradise-lichen 
as should glut the markets of 
a hundred worlds. But my 
spirit is not equal to the pros- 
pect of biterforms and gouger- 
forms without end. I am 
shamed before you. .” 

“To tell you the truth, I’m 
old-fashioned myself. I’d rath- 
er watch the action from a 
distance too.” 

“But surely your spawn-fel- 
lows would never condone 
such an attitude.” 

“My spawn-fellows aren’t 
here. And besides, didn’t I 
mention it? No one who’s real- 
ly in the know would think of 
engaging in competition by 
mere combat if there were any 
other way. Now, you men- 
tioned tilling the sand, raising

lichens — things like that — ” 
*^That on which we dined 
but now/' said Hoshick, ‘‘and 
front which the wine is made," 
*‘The big news in fashion- 
able diploniacy today is farm- 
ing competition. Now, if you'd 
like to take these deserts and 
raise lichen, we'll promise to 
stick to the oases and ^ 
vegetables." 

Hoshick curled his back in 
attention. “Retief, you’re 
quite serious? You would 
leave all the fair sand hills to 
us?" 

"The whole works, Hoshick. 
I'll take the oases.” 

Hoshick rippled his fringes 
ecstatically. “Once again you 
have outdone me, Retief," he 
cried. “This time, in generos- 
ity.” 

“We’ll talk over the details 
later. I'm sure we can establish 
a set of rules that will satisfy 
all parties. Now I’ve got to get 
back. I think some of the gou- 
gerforms are waiting to see 
me." 

IV 

I T was nearly dawn when Re- 
tief gave the whistled sig- 
nal he had agreed on with 
Potter, then rose and walked 
into the camp circle. Swazey 
stood up. 

“There you are," he said. 
“We been wonderin’ whether 
to go out after you." 

Lemuel came forward, one 
eye black to the cheekbone. 
He held out a raw-boned hand. 
“Sorry I jumped you, stranger. 



Tell you the truth, I thought 
you w^ some kind of stool- 
pigeon from the CDT." 

Bert came up behind Lem- 
uel. “How do you know he 
ain’t, Lemuel?" hex said. “May- 
be he—" 

Lemuel floored Bert with a 
backward sweep of his arm. 
“Next cotton-picker says some 
embassy Johnny can cool me 
gets worse’n that." 

“Tell me," said Retief. 
“How are you boys fixed for 
wine?" 

“Wine? Mister, we been 
livin’ on stump water for a 
year now. ’Dobe’s fatal to the 
kind of bacteria it takes to 
ferment likker." 

“Try this." Retief handed 
over a sqat jug. Swazey drew 
the cork, sniffed, drank and 
passed it to Lemuel. 

“Mister, where’d you get 
that?" 

“The Flap-jacks make it. 
Here’s another question for 
you: Would you concede a 
share in this planet to the 
Flap-jacks in return for a 
peace guarantee?" 

At the end of a half hour of 
heated debate Lemuel turned 
to Retief. “We’ll make any 
reasonable deal," he said. “I 
guess they got as much right 
here as we have. I think we’d 
agree to a fifty-fifty split. 
That’d give about a hundred 
and fifty oases to each side.” 

“What would you say to 
keeping all the oases and giv- 
ing them the desert?" 

Lemuel reached for the 
wine jug, eyes on Retief.

“Keep talkin’, mister,” he said. 
“I think you got yourself a 
deal.” 

C ONSUL Passwyn glanced 
up at Retief, went on per- 
using a paper. 

‘‘Sit down, Retief,” he said 
absently. “I thought you were 
over on Pueblo, or Mud-flat, 
or whatever they call that des- 
ert.” 

‘‘Fm back.” 

Passwyn eyed him sharply. 
‘‘Well, well, what is it you 
need, man? Speak up. Don’t 
expect me to request any mili- 
tary assistance, no matter how 
things are. 

Retief passed a bundle of 
documents across the desk. 
‘‘Here’s the Treaty. And a 
Mutual Assistance Pact dec- 
laration and a trade agree- 
ment.” 

“Eh?” Passwyn picked up 
the papers, riffled through 



them. He leaned back in his 
chair, beamed. 

“Well, Retief. Expeditious- 
ly handled.” He stopped, 
blinked at Retief. “You seem 
to have a bruise on your jaw. 
I hope you’ve been conducting 
yourself as befits a member 
of the Embassy staff.” 

“I attended a sporting 
event,” Retief said. “One of 
the players got a little excit- 
ed.” 

“Well. .it’s one of the haz- 
ards of the profession. One 
must pretend an interest in 
such matters.” Passwyn rose, 
extended a hand. “You’ve 
done well, my boy. Let this 
teach you the value of follow- 
ing instructions to the letter.” 

Outside, by the hall inciner-

enough to take from his brief- 
case a large buff envelope, 
still sealed, and drop it in the 
slot. end

RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN

IF • Short Story 



J EHN Dofan was a very hu- 
man-looking and highly in- 
telligent young man, but some- 
times he did not show good 
sense. Any young man might 
meet a girl night after night 
in an apple orchard, but Dofan 
had to do it in time of war, 
behind enemy lines, with the 
daughter of the mayor. On 
top of that he had to try to 
pry information out of her. 

Even this might have been 
all right if Dofan had used a 
little more sense. After four 
consecutive nights of press- 
ings and squeezings and heavy 
breathings, one does not 
maintain a stony silence when 
a girl like Betty Fuller nes- 
tles up closer and says, ‘"We 
will be so happy together."’ 
The situation swiftly deterio- 



by THEODORE L. THOMAS 



rated after that. He wound up 
under arrest. 

Flung into a root cellar, 
Jehn Dofan underwent a short 
but intense period of ques- 
tioning by three burly sol- 
diers, aided by the butt end of 
their flintlock rifles and di- 
rected by a second lieutenant 
bent on promotion. Dofan told 
them nothing. But it did not 
matter. As the soldiers left, 
the second lieutenant said, 
drawing himself to attention, 
“You hang at dawn, scum. We 
know how to treat spies.” 

For the first time Dofan 
saw that he was in trouble. 

Betty Fuller rushed in as 
the soldiers went out. She 
flung herself on Dofan and 
covered his bloodied face with 
kisses and wept into the hoi-

and make his name immortal. 

It was easy. He just had to die!

low of his neck. “My darling/' 
she wailed, “what have I done 
to you?" 

With this to work on, Do- 
fan might have extricated him- 
self even then, for Betty Full- 
er’s father was the mayor, 
and a friendly mayor wields 
much influence even with the 
military if he puts his mind 
to it. But Dofan, although 
very human-looking and high- 
ly intelligent, did not show 
good sense for the second 
time in the same night. 

He looked at Betty Fuller 
coldly and said, “You’ve done 
enough. Why don’t you let me 
alone?" 

Her eyes widened in disbe- 
lief and then flashed in hatred. 
She turned and tapped calmly 
on the door, and the soldiers 
let her out. 

D awn was dose, and Do- 
fan had no time to lose. 
He went to a corner of the 
root cellar and listened to 
make certain no one was com- 
ing. With his right thumb he 
probed deep up under his 
right jaw. He found the tiny 
button imbedded there, and he 
pushed it and held it. 

He said softly, “Jehn Do- 
fan calling Base. Jehn Dofan 
calling. .’’ 

“We have you, Dofan. 
Talk." 

“I'm captured, heavily 
guarded. They plan to hang 
me at dawn, less than an hour. 
Condition appears desperate. 
I need help." 

“Will this rescue constitute 



a major interference with the 
natives? And, if so, are you 
willing to stand court-mar- 
tial?" 

“Yes," said Dofan. “I be- 
lieve it will require major in- 
terference, and I am willing to 
stand court-martial." 

“Stand by for instructions." 

Dofan removed his thumb 
and paced back and forth in 
the root cellar in the candle- 
light. 

Now that he had committed 
himself, he was a little sorry. 
But there seemed no other 
way out. This would spoil a 
perfect . record here on the 
planet Earth. Betty Fuller 
had succeeded in ruining him. 
He would be drummed out of 
the Controllers, and she and 
the other Earth people did not 
even know such an organiza- 
tion existed. There would 
come a time when he could. 

A series of sharp buzzes 
echoed inside his head. It 
startled him; he had not ex- 
pected his instructions so 
soon. He went to the corner 
and pressed the switch under 
his jaw and said, “Jehn Do- 
fan." 

“This is Charn Dofan. How 
are you, brother?" 

Dofan felt his breath catch 
in his throat, and for a mo- 
ment he could not speak. A 
great feeling of relief swept 
over him. Charn Dofan was 
here, his older brother, come 
to him in a time of trouble as 
always. 

He said, “Cham, it is good 
to hear your voice. Where

THE SPY 




arc you calling from, broth- 
er?’’ 

‘‘About a mile away. I com- 
mand a troop of cavalry sta- 
tioned in Brooklyn. I heard 
your call to Base and came 
out. Are you well?” 

‘‘Very well, brother. And 
you?” 

“Very well.” 

A silence fell. The silence 
rested uncomfortably and 
strangely with Jehn Dofan. 
There had never been any 
strained silences between him 
and his brother. Something 
was wrong. He asked, “Is all 
well at home?” 

There was a perceptible 
pause before the answer came. 
“Our parents and our family 
are all in good health.” Again 
the silence. 

Jehn Dofan said, “Tell me 
what is wrong, Charn. Base 
will call soon to tell me of 
the rescue procedure. What 
is it?” 

A pause, then Charn Dofan 
began to speak. “Our Islands 
at home are ready to demand 
full statehood. The Main- 
landers are trying to find 
some way to keep us out. A 
vote will be taken next week. 
As things stand now, we can 
just about muster the neces- 
sary strength, but it won’t 
take much to change things. 
We won’t get another chance 
for a long while. We’ll have 
to keep paying the taxes, let- 
ting them bleed us white, con- 
trolling our production.” 

Jehn Dofan nodded in un- 
derstanding. “Yes, our people 



have worked toward state- 
hood for a long time. I hope 
we make it.” 

Again the silence. Jehn 
Dofan was puzzled. 

He said, “What is wrong? 
What can we do about it from 
here?” 

T his time his brother’s 
words poured out, 
wrenched from the heart. 
“Base commander is a Main- 
lander! He will have to inter- 
fere openly with the natives to 
rescue you, and this will re- 
flect on all the Islanders. No 
question about it, Jehn. It 
will tip the vote the wrong 
way. Your rescue will be an 
international incident back 
home.” 

Jehn Dofan shook his head 
regretfully and said, “I sup- 
pose you are right. But I 
don’t know how we can stop 
him from here. We are...” 
And then he understood. 

He felt sick to his stomach, 
and he began to perspire. His 
breath caught in his throat. 
His heart pounded. He re- 
fused to accept the full reali- 
zation — kept thrusting it out 
of his mind — but it kept in- 
truding. 

His brother continued, 
“Base will be calling in a few 
moments. I will be nearby, no 
- matter what happens. Call on 
me for anything. I will abide 
by your decision. Good-by.” 
The radio fell silent before 
Jehn Dofan could speak. 

He was alone in the cellar. 
He slumped to the dirt, too 
weak to pace.

He was frightened. He had 
not seriously considered the 
possibility of dying on this 
planet. Yet here he was, in a 
position where his own broth- 
er had to point out the de- 
sirability of letting himself be 
executed instead of rescued. 
The Islands needed a hero 
now, not a goat. He needed 
time to think this out. 

But there was no time. The 
buzzer sounded inside his 
head. He jumped. He went to 
the corner and pushed the 
switch and spoke. 

‘^Base commander,” was the 
response, and without further 
preamble the commander 
launched into a description 
of the rescue plans. In spite 
of the turmoil that raged in 
his mind, Dofan recognized 
that the plans were more vio- 
lent and complex than they 
needed to be. It was apparent 
that the commander was seiz- 
ing the opportunity to make 
trouble. The recognition 
steeled his mind. 

‘‘There will be no rescue. 
Commander., I have decided 
that I do not want to be the 
cause of such open interfer- 
ence.” 

The commander started to 
speak, but then fell silent, rec- 
ognizing the impropriety of 
arguing with Dofan about 
such a matter. But his fury 
was apparent. Feeling it. Do- 
fan said, “There is no need 
to talk further. Commander. I 
sign off now. Do not risk open 
interference by contacting me 
again. Good-by, sir.” 

THE SPY 



T hey came for him short- 
ly. They marched him be- 
tween two colunms of red- 
coated soldiers to the slow 
beat of muffled drums. He 
climbed the gallows steps in 
the bright morning sunshine 
and looked out over the Long 
Island countryside. As they 
adjusted the noose around his 
neck, his eyes swept the as- 
sembled crowd. There to the 
left, among the others, stood 
a tall, black-haired figure in 
a red coat. The eyes and nose 
were the same as his eyes and 
nose, and he looked at his 
brother and smiled. 

A few feet from his brother, 
all unknowing, stood Betty 
Fuller, and for a wild moment 
he considered calling out to 
her for help. He saw the sneer 
on her face, and he was im- 
mediately ashamed of his mo- 
mentary weakness. He gritted 
his teeth and tried to think of 
a way to die well. 

He looked up to the sky, 
in a westerly direction. He 
could not see it, for it was 
light-years away, but he knew 
it was there. A lovely island 
on another planet, bathed in 
warm breezes, the place where 
his people were. 

His executioners asked him, 
“Do you have anything to say, 
schoolmaster?” 

Then he knew what to do 
to swing the vote; it came to 
him all of a sudden. With his 
face raised toward home, he 
said, “I only regret that I have 
but one life to lose for my 
-country.” END

Here’s the genuine, inside, 
light-hearted story of 



DEATH AND TAXES 



by H. A. HARTZELL illustrated by dyas 



44TT’S a crime, Your Honor,” 

-I said the young man with 
the dreamy eyes and paint- 
smeared sport-shirt. ”The 
Council not only proposes 
tearing down this picturesque 
landmark, but would thereby 
destroy the home of our only 
local ghost.” 

“Really, Mr. Masterson!” 
The mayor smiled to show he 
knew Jerry Masterson was 
only kidding, then brandished 
a State Highway Commission 
report recommending that the 
antiquated Waukeena Light- 
house be demolished. “Mr. 
Masterson, we respect your 
feelings as an artist, and are 
well aware of the local super- 
stition regarding the ghost of 
Captain MacGreggor, but this 
building is over seventy years 
old and needs expensive re- 
pairs. The financial burden is 
too great for our metropolis of 



less than fifteen hundred 
souls. The State has dis- 
avowed responsibility, and — ” 
“Your Honor!” 

“The chair recognizes Mr. 
Higgins.” 

“As president of the Histor- 
ical Soci I wish to state we 
vigorously oppose the wreck- 
ing of this building. One by 
one, our landmarks have fall- 
en. Are we to hand down to 
our children a community 
without pride of ancestry? 
Are we — ?” 

“Your Honor,” bellowed an- 
other voice. “As a member of 
the Taxpayers League. .” 

For two hours, sentiment 
battled hotly with double-en- 
try bookkeeping. Then the 
City Council expressed its 
deep regrets to the Historical 
Society — and unanimously ac- 
cepted the bid of Sam Schultz 
Salvage Company. Mr. Schultz 



26 





handed the Council his check 
for five hundred dollars and 
was authorized to begin 
wrecking immediately. 

‘‘First thing tomorrow 
morning,” Mr. Schultz prom- 
ised. 

T omorrow morning! As 
he walked into the spring 
night, toward the old, decay- 
ing house where he lived 
alone, Jerry Masterson felt 
sadness. His own difficulties 
had prepared him to admit 
life was geared to financial 
considerations. But things had 
come to a pretty pass when 
even a ghost was not safe 
from dollars and cents. “Poor 
Captain Wully,” he said with^ 
out realizing he spoke aloud. 

“Aye, aye,’’ said a voice. 
“Poor Wully MacGreggor. As 
a ghost in good standing, a 
dues-paying member of As- 
modeus Local of the United 
Lighthouse Haunters of 
America, Wully never done 
nothin’ to deserve this. Evict- 
ed I Got a smoke, matey?” 
Jerry Masterson did a dou- 
ble-take. Out of reflex cour- 
tesy, he proffered a cigarette 
and was about to strike a 
match when his companion 
reached slightly to the left, 
where several coals glowed in 
mid-air. Selecting one, the 
stranger said, “Thank you. 
Junior. You can go now.” He 
turned, lit Jerry’s cigarette 
and his own. 

“All right, joker,” said Jer- 
ry. “Show me how you did it 
and I’ll show you a couple of 

DEATH AND TAXES 



card tricks and a disappearing 
penny routine.^ 

“Later,” said the stranger. 
“Right now, matey, my sails is 
draggin’ and I need spiritual 
reinforcement— 1 i q u i d. And 
you're buying.^ 

“There’s a fifth of Scotch in 
my studio, but I’m not pouring 
for any phony tricksters. I’ve 
been saving it till I sold a 
canvas.” 

“Scotch,” sighed the strang- 
er ecstatically. “Shades of 
the Loch Ness Monster! Quit 
scratching, Gertrude.” 

“Gertrude?” 

“My cat — she’s black. A 
handsome beastie if you over- 
look a hole in her head. A 
twenty-two caliber hole. Ger- 
trude, materialize for the nice 
man.” 

Nothing happened, and Jer- 
ry diplomatically sought to 
ease a situation that was 
rapidly becoming embarrass- 
ing. “Maybe she’s bashful.” 

“Not Gertrude. Just temper- 
amental. She could materialize 
if she wanted to. She doesn’t 
want to. Now take Junior. .” 

“Junior?” 

“He’s the conscientious 
type. Tries too hard, poor 
boy.” 

“About that Scotch,” said 
Jerry. “You don’t think may- 
be a couple of cups of black 
coffee. 

The stranger’s face regis- 
tered horror — and trust be- 
trayed. “For shame, laddie. To 
be insulted in my darkest 
hour! Me, Captain Wully 
MacGreggor !” 



27 




“Sure. You’re Wully Mac- 
Greggor — and I’m Napoleon.” 
“Watch.” 

There was nothing to watch. 
The stranger had disappeared. 
A disem^died voice said, 
“Now about that Scotch? If 
Waukeena light is being torn 
down tomorrow, I’ll be home- 
less. I’ve got a lot of haunting 
to do in the little time that’s 
left. And here we stand, wag- 
gin’ our jaws.” 

Jerry’s first impulse was to 
run like hell. “But I don’t be- 
lieve in ghosts!” His voice 
sounded. 

“Of course you do. If you 

didn’t, you couldn’t have seen 
>* 

me. 

He’d heard of self-hypnosis 
—apparently the session with 
the Mayor had upset him. “All 
right, so you’re Wully Mac- 
Greggor. Why pick on me?” 
“Because I like you,” said 
the ghost. “You said a kind 
word for me to the City Coun- 
cil and I’d like to do some- 
thing nice for you.” 

“If you can’t help yourself, 
I don’t see how you’re going 
to be much help to me, but 
what’ve I got to lose?” He 
was too numb to worry fur- 
ther. Ghosts, yet. ! 

N ext morning, Jerry Mas- 
terson awoke with a hang- 
over. He dimly remembered 
floating lights, red, yellow, 
blue and green. He remem- 
bered Captain Wully scaring 
a couple of lovers with noises 
the young lady described as 
“something like bagpipes in 

23 



an echo chamber.” And he 
seemed to remember that, to- 
ward the end of the evening, 
Gertrude had deigned to ma- 
terialize — along with a head- 
less black ox and a white stag. 

He shook his head and 
reached for the aspirin. “As 
of now,” he promised himself, 
“I’m on the wagon.” He 
seemed to recall a snake too, a 
seven-headed snake with a 
gleaming carbuncle in the 
middle head. Permanently on 
the wagon! A scraping noise 
came from above. He listened. 
The noise occurred again. It 
seemed to emanate from the 
tower room on the third floor. 
He raced up the winding Vic- 
torian staircase, on up the nar- 
row stairs to the attic, and 
stopped. 

From behind the tower 
room door, came thin, eerie 
skirling of bagpipes. 

“Hey, you in there,” he 
called. 

“Matey!” boomed Captain 
Wully’s voice. “Come on in.” 

Captain Wully was seated 
on an old sea-chest, the bag- 
pipes still tucked under his 
arm. “Hope my practicing 
didn’t disturb you. I play sec- 
ond bagpipe in the banshee 
band.” 

“But the scraping noise. 

“My sea-chest. I had a lit- 
tle trouble getting you home 
by cockcrow, and I had to 
move the sea-chest on over- 
time. I want to say right now 
it was right decent of you to 
offer me a home on such short 
acquaintance. I appreciate it,

and I promise to show my — ** 
-‘Look/^ said Jerry. ‘‘All 
this time I was being so big- 
hearted, did I also say I was 
going to have to sell the house 
for non-payment of taxes?” 
“You didn’t. If I’d a-known 
that, I’d put you wise to grab- 
bing Celeste’s carbuncle. It’s 
goc^ luck.” 

“It didn’t bring you any 
luck.” 

“I’m not eligible. Employ- 
ees, relatives etc.” 

“Why can’t I get it now?” 
“Too late. Celeste only ma- 
terializes once every seven 
years. Those canvases you 
mentioned. For sale?” 

“No bidders, and the critics 
all agree. Competent drafts- 
manship, highly finished tech- 
nique — ^but carefully uni- 
maginative, middle-class.” 
“The pictures — where are 
they now?” 

“Downstairs. I was going to 
crate them today, and send 
them to the Art Festival at 
Northport, but I’ve got the 
shakes too bad.” 

Captain Wully pushed back 
the tarn on his head, scratched 
his balding dome. “I’ve got it. 
You catch yourself a nap, 
matey. I’ll crate the pictures 
for you and batten down the 
hatches all nice an’ ship- 
shape.” 

J ERRY Masterson, when he 
draped himself over the 
bumpy carvings on the studio 
love seat, intended to take 
only a quick forty winks. But 
the morning was well spent 

DEATH AND TAXES 



when he awakened, stiff and 
cramped. Two sturdy crates 
stood near the door and, from 
the skylight end of the studio, 
wafted a rich fragrance of 
latakia. Captain Wully drew 
deeply on a Scotch briar filled 
with Jerry’s private blend of 
tobacco, waved his pipe to- 
ward the easel and said, “A 
right bonnie lass, matey. Your 
betrothed?” 

Jerry shook his head dole- 
fully. “Her family are Cov- 
ered Wagon. You’ve no idea 
what that means in a small 
town like this. My uncle lived 
here fifteen years and was 
still a ‘newcomer’ when he 
died and left me the house. 
I’ve been here two years, but 
that’s a Johnny-come-lately to 
the Higginses. Her name’s 
Heather, and I doubt if she 
knows I’m alive.” 

Captain Wully twirled his 
mustache, which curled lux- 
uriantly at either end and was 
of an improbable shade Jerry 
classified as Hunter’s Pink. So 
was his beard. “What did you 
say her name was?” 

“Heather Higgins.” 

“You sighed the second time 
* you said it, too. I just wanted 
to be sure.” 

Jerry crossed to the unfin- 
ished canvas. “Hair like sun- 
shine on slightly oxidized 
copper. Eyes blue like the sea 
where it meets the horizon on 
a summer day.” 

Gertrude!** yelled Captain 
Wully. 

From the turbulence of the 
air current which marked Ger- 

29 




trade’s passing, Jerry decided 
the invisible cat had been in a 
hurry. 

‘‘And who are you, and 
what are you doing here?” 
Captain Wully yelled at a 
second slipstream. 

Distinctly audible was a 
high pitched caterwauling. In 
addition, there was a sound 
that made Jerry’s curly hair 
crawl — the baying of a wolf? 

“I better look into this,” 
Captain Wully muttered and 
dashed outside. As he reached 
the doorway, his figure melt- 
ed into transparency, then into 
air. 

Jerry loaded the crated 
paintings into his car and 
took them to the express of- 
fice. They wouldn’t sell — they 
never did. But he couldn’t af- 
ford to pass up the chance 
that they might. 

When he returned home, 
there was no sign of Captain 
Wully, only a few paper can- 
dy wrappers on the floor. He 
started to pick them up, but 
remembered he wanted to im- 
prison a highlight on Heather 
Higgins’s nose and forgot the 
papers. 

Someone had been into his 
paints. A tube of Payne’s gray 
had been pressed dry. The cap 
was off the gamboge, and a 
new tube of bice green had 
been squeezed in fhe middle. 
Nor had the intruder bothered 
to scrape the palette, which 
gleamed with puddles of col- 
or. 

A dab of ivory, the hint of 
rose madder and a suspicion 



of cadmium yellow fused un- 
der his brush tip. Creative 
fury struck him, and he failed 
to notice a figure that paused 
at the outside front gate. The 
figure stooped, picked up 
something, then carefully 
scanned the inside walkway. 
Here, too, she picked up some- 
thing. She stooped momentari- 
ly on the front porch, and 
again in the hallway. 

T hen Heather Higgins 
stood in the studio. Her 
gaze swept the floor, and she 
bent over to pick up a candy 
wrapper. 

“You don’t have to do that,” 
Jerry said. “I was getting 
around to it — eventually.” 

She whirled to face him. 
Her eyes turned from azure to 
ultramarine. “You might tell 
me what’s going on around 
here !” 

“Suppose you tell me, I’m 
still trying to catch up with 
it myself.” 

‘^Thiefr 

“Thief?” 

“Stealing Scotch whiskey 
and my new plaid skirt! But 
you made a mistake on the 
rum butter toffee. I trailed 
the wrappers.” 

The Scotch whiskey and 
rum toffee Jerry could see a 
reason for — but not the plaid 
skirt. “So help me, I’m inno- 
cent.” 

“So you’re innocent!” She 
dashed to a comer behind the 
easel and snatched a plaid 
skirt from the floor. 

“You'll just have to believe 



30

me. I had nothing to do with 
it.’’ 

‘‘Oh no?” 

‘‘Look at me. Do I look like 
a criminal?” 

As she looked her expres- 
sion softened slightly, but she 
said, “I always picked the 
wrong picture in psychology 
tests. It’s you innocent look- 
ing fellows that always turn 
out to be the crooks.” 

Jerry tried his best to look 
desperate. The result was too 
much for Heather Higgins, 
who laughed. 

‘‘Hold it,” Jerry said. ‘‘I 
want to catch your eyes.” 

He grabbed his brush and 
made several quick strokes on 
the canvas. 

“Why,” she said, “it looks 
like me — a. little. But I’m not 
that pretty.” 

“You are. And it’d look 
more like you if I didn’t have 
to do it from memory.” 

And that was how Heather 
Higgins reluctantly happened 
to promise Jerry Masterson 
she’d return next morning for 
a sitting. She left, and Jerry 
was eating dinner when Cap- 
tain Wully walked in to the 
whistled measures of Comin* 
Through the Rye, 

**Ryer said Jerry. “You? 
Rye?” 

“I borrowed her old man’s 
Scotch, if that’s what you’re 
gettin’ at. And if you think I 
enjoyed eatin’ all that candy 
just to leave a trail — I hope I 
don’t see another piece of can- 
dy for three hundred years.” 

“Just to satisfy my curi- 

DEATH AND TAXES 



osity,” Jerry pleaded, “where 
does the plaid skirt come in?” 
“The MacGreggor tartan? I 
needed a kilt.” 

“All of a sudden you need 
a kilt. Why?” 

“It’s a long story. But 
first — ” he reached into a cup- 
board and produced Jerry’s 
safety razor — “do you mind if 
I borrow this? And where do 
you keep the scissors?” 

It took fifteen minutes to 
locate the scissors. 

“We were discussing a 
kilt,” Jerry prompted. 

“If a body kiss a body, need 
a body cry,” sang Captain 
Wully’s baritone. 

But, eventually. Captain 
Wully and the scissors were 
seated at the table behind a 
round magnifying mirror. “It 
begins with Gertrude. You re- 
member how she scooted 
through the studio this after- 
noon with a werewolf after 
her?” 

“How stupid of me not to 
realize.” 

“I felt Gertrude needed 
help. I caught up with the 
werewolf and gave him a piece 
of my mind. ‘Pretty small po- 
tatoes,’ I says, ‘when a were- 
wolf chases cats. You must be 
pretty second-rate to have 
fallen so low. A regular lamb 
in wolf’s clothing.’ T’ll have 
you know,’ he says, T’m pretty 
hot stuff. Related to Dracula 
on my mammy’s side, and to 
Frankenstein on my pap- 
py’s.’ ” 

The scissors snipped rapid- 
ly, and bits of pink mustache 

31 




littered the unswept floor. 

“ ‘A renegade/ I says. ‘Your 
family must be awfully proud 
of you. Chasing cats!’ 
Ouch — ” as the scissors 
slipped. “I says, ‘Where do 
you live?’ And he says, ‘Down 
the road a piece. I’m lapdog 
for an Indian princess.’ ‘I 
think,’ I says, usin’ my head 
real quick like, ‘I better see 
you home and see what your 
mistress has to say about 
this.’ ” 

The mustache having been 
whittled to a tailored tooth- 
brush, Captain Wully started 
on his beard. “You should see 
her, laddie. A real Indian 
princess, left over from a Lov- 
ers Leap. Bein’ four hundred 
years old, she’s real aristoc- 
racy and doesn’t mingle with 
younger ghosts, which is why 
I never seen her before. My- 
self, I’m three score and hard- 
ly in her class. Although I 
must say she took a shine to 
me. But Indian braves don’t 
wear beards.’’ 

Captain Wully put down the 
razor and revealed that he 
too was beardless. “Sporran, 
silver buckles and all the fix- 
in’s I got in my sea-chest — but 
my kilt went down wi’ my 
ship.” 

When Captain Wully real- 
ized Heather Higgins had tak- 
en the plaid skirt home, he 
was inconsolable. 

H eather Higgins kept 

her appointment to sit 
next morning. She was greet- 
ed at the mailbox by a sub- 



dued young man, who hastily 
shoved in his pocket a letter 
promising drastic action in 
the matter of “tax liens 
against property situate, to 
wit, etc.” 

“The oddest thing has hap- 
pened,” she said. 

And Jerry knew. “The plaid 
skirt is gone again.” 

She gave him a chilly look. 
“See here! For a young man 
who claims to know nothing 
about — 

“It’s my handyman,” he bab- 
bled. “My handyman’s a klep- 
tomaniac.” 

“Lem Butler’s the only 
handyman in town. Don’t try 
to tell me Lem — ” 

“Since the person concerned 
is progressing toward a cure, 
I can’t mention names. 
Couldn’t you let me pay for 
the skirt?” It took a lot of 
fast talking, and it took time 
— but he finally diverted her 
attention. 

She was a patient model. He 
quickly blocked in the flowing 
waves of her hair. But a lis- 
tening look had come over her. 
Jerry listened too. 

Down the stairwell drifted 
muted notes of a bagpipe, 
striving to adapt its chromatic 
limitations to ^Indian Love 
Call.* Another instrument was 
audible also. 

“Funny thing about this 
house,” he said. “When I first 
moved in, I used to think I 
heard bagpipes.” 

“Accompanied by a glock- 
enspiel ?” 

“Is that what it is?”

The upper half of a very el- 
derly gentleman bobbed in. 

Junior r bawled Captain 
Wully from the stairs. 

‘'Leave me alone/* pleaded 
the elderly gentleman. “Lem- 
me concentrate.** 

Captain Wully dashed in. 
“For shame, Junior. Steal- 

ingr 

Junior*s eyes filled with 
tears. “Just one more nip, and 
I know I could have relaxed 
enough to finish materializ- 
ing. 

Heather’s fascinated gaze 
wavered between the bottom- 
less Junior and Captain Wul- 
ly’s kilt. The kilt had a zipper 
placket exactly like a lady’s 
skirt. “I think I’m losing my 
mind,” she said. 

Jerry Masterson attempted 
to explain the inexplicable. 
He recounted events of the 
preceding several days and 
concluded, “No matter what 
you think, you couldn’t see 
him if you didn’t believe.” 
“What about the glocken- 
spiel?” she asked weakly. 

“That’s Red Skeleton,” said 
Captain Wully. “He uses a 
couple of ball-peen hammers 
on his ribs. We was tunin’ up 
to serenade Pocahauntus.” 
“The cat,” said Heather. 
“She’s left out.” 

“Oh, no, she ain’t. Gertrude 
sings coloratura.” 

**That even I don’t believe,” 
said Jerry. 

J UNIOR’S upper half poised 
before the easel, and he 
flourished a brush. “Just a 

DEATH AND TAXES 



touch about the eyes. And an- 
other here.” He flicked at the 
mouth. 

“Get away from there T 
yelled Jerry. 

Junior burst into tears 
again. “I was only trying to 
help. Besides, it did need — ” 

“Well, I’ll be...” Jerry 
looked at the canvas. “Junior 
was right.” 

“About Gertrude,” insisted 
Captain Wully. “If you don’t 
believe it, why don’t you come' 
serenadin’ with us, you and 
Miss Heather?” 

Jerry looked inquiringly at 
Hfeather. 

“I’ll hate myself if I do,” 
she said. 

“Then we won’t go.” 

“But I’ll hate myself worse 
if I don’t.” 

He called that evening to 
take her to the serenade, and 
met her family. Mr. Higgins 
was very pleasant. Mrs. Hig- 
gins was very pleasant. But 
Jerry was uncomfortably 
aware of a large photograph 
on the mantle. The photograph 
was of a young man, and it 
was not pleasant. Its eyes fol- 
lowed Heather Higgins pos- 
sessively. The photograph’s 
tailored suit intimated its 
pockets were not lined with 
tax liens. 

Mrs. Higgins noticed Jer- 
ry’s interest. “That’s Wesley 
Tatom.” 

“Of the First National Bank 
Tatoms,” said Mrs. Higgins. 

“His great grandfather was 
Ephraim Tatom,” said Mrs. 
Higgins.

Ephraim Tatom, so Jerry 
gathered in the next half hour, 
had practically blazed the 
Oregon Trail single-handed. 

''Wesley is attending the 
State Bankers Convention 
right now,” said Mr. Higgins. 

Mrs. Higgins gave Jerry a 
meaningful look. "We’re very 
fond of dear, sweet Wesley,” 
she said. 

Jerry was understandably 
relieved when it came time to 
depart. 

As for the serenade, Ger- 
trude was in fine voice. Her 
words were incomprehensible, 
but no more so than foreign 
opera. Captain Wully puffed 
through Indian Love Call and 
a pibroch or two on the pipes, 
ably assisted by Red Skeleton 
on the glockenspiel and Jun- 
ior on the mouth-harp. 

Princess Pocahauntus was 
impressed by Captain Wully’s 
full dress. She fingered the 
flowing shoulder plaid, tsk- 
tsking over the fineness of 
such a blanket. And the silver 
buckle s— only a big chief 
would possess such wealth. 

Gertrude bristled, and ^s- 
car, the werewolf, dashed up 
with a limp and furry trophy, 
which he laid at the princess’ 
feet. 

“What’s that?” Heather 
gasped. 

“A sidehill gouger,” ex- 
plained Pocahauntus. “Sec?” 

S HE put the little animal up- 
right, or as nearly upright 
as circumstances permitted, 
for the gouger's left legs were 

DEATH AND TAXES 



three inches shorter than his 
right ones. Reaching into her 
reticule, she produced a cou- 
ple of artistically carved bone 
pegs, which she fastened to 
the abbreviated left legs. 
“Prosthetics. Relics of our 
last gouger, who migrated to 
Switzerland.” 

“Somebody ought to write a 
book,” mused Heather. 

“Lots of books have been 
written,” said Pocahauntus, 
“but not one from the 'inside.' 
What we spirits need is a 
John Gunther. Now take the 
subject of Lovers Leaps. More 
twaddle has been written 
about — ” 

“I’ve done a couple of re- 
gional articles for the Covered 
Wagon Quarterly, but nobody 
wants to print my historical 
fiction,” said Heather. “What 
about Lovers Leaps?” 

“Now take my own. I was 
really running away from a 
greasy warrior. He chased me 
to the cliff edge and, in my 
girlish innocence, I jumped. 
What price virtue!” 

“Too bad I wasn’t around,” 
mourned Captain Wully. “I’d 
a-caught you.” 

“If I had it to do over 
again, I wouldn’t jump.” Her 
black eyes flashed, and she 
drew herself up regally. “I’d 
push that feather-headed Cas- 
anova off instead.” 

Then, graciously, she sug- 
gested barbecuing a salmon 
over the open fire, but Heath- 
er was afraid it would take 
too long and her parents 
might worry. So she and Jer- 



35 




ry excused themselves and left 
^ptain Wully to his court- 
ing. As Jerry walked Heather 
up the front steps, the scent of 
lilacs was an invitation to ro- 
mance, the moon a lover’s 
promise. 

“Good night,** said Heather. 
“It’s been such fun.“ 

Her handclasp carried a hint 
of finality that went be- 
yond words, and Jerry said, 
^Beenr^ 

“Wesley gets back tomor- 
row.” 

Without being told, Jerry 
knew that Heather’s portrait 
would have to be finished 
from memory. Any man 
worthy of the name, Jerry 
told himself, would have ar- 
gued the point — unless he was 
broke and jobless and had a 
tax lien in his pocket. 

He tried to work on her pic- 
ture next morning, sought to 
imprison the laughter of her 
eyes, the song of her lips. But 
then he realized that the 
laughter was for somebody 
else. The song too. 

From above came a few ex- 
perimental notes on the glock- 
enspiel. Presently Junior’s 
mouth harp joined in. The 
melody -staggered uncertainly, 
finally emerged as Mendels- 
sohn’s Wedding March, 

Jerry threw down his brush 
and left the house. He walked 
toward the lighthouse. That 
once stately saltbox had al- 
ready lost its lensed cupola 
and most of its siding. He 
watched for a long time as the 
Sam Schultz Salvage Compa- 



ny pried board from board and 
piled all in a stack of jack- 
straws. Maybe he could go to 
work for Sam Schultz and 
make enough to pay off the 
taxes. And, if he observed all 
the Horatio Alger niceties, 
maybe some day he’d own the 
company and could seek 
Heather Higgins’ hand in mar- 
riage — only to discover she 
had long since married Wes- 
ley. 

He walked along the beach. 
Climbing to a jutting promon- 
tory, he watched waves break 
against the rocks below. Why 
not throw himself into the 
sea? He could become a ghost, 
and maybe find a lady ghost, 
and. 

H e went home and forced 
himself to work on 
Heather Higgins’ portrait. He 
filled an entire sketch pad 
with brief line drawings of 
her until, late at night, he 
finally fell asleep in his chair. 
He awakened to broad day- 
light — and the whistling of 
the. postman. 

The letter was from Eloise 
Wright, Chairman of the 
Northport Art Festival, and 
concerned his canvases. 

Ellis is positively dithy- 
nmbicl Claims you*ve 
caught a hauntingly spirit- 
ual quality, and wants to 
buy the storm canvas for his 
San Francisco galleries. 
Barret, the Chicago Barret, 
is lyrical about the spectral 
lights and shadows, and is 



hy »C A. HARTZELL 




writing his New York deal- 
er about a showing. Have 
sold four canvases. Enclose 
certified check — 

Jerry reached for a chair. 
Four canvases? His asking 
price for four canvases had 
never come to any such figure 
as the check represented. The 
letter contained a postscript. 

Barret is out of his head 
over ^'Gertrude.*' Impres - , 
sionism at its finest, with 
an eerie, imaginative qual- 
ity unsurpassed by any 
American artist. Soul of the 
eternally feminine, as typi- 
fied by a cat with a hole in 
the head. Social satire in 
oil. Picture not priced. He 
asks what will you take 
within reason? One thou- 
sand? 

Jerry was sure of only one 
thing. He’d never painted any 
picture of Gertrude. There 
was, however, the matter of 
that tube of bice green 
squeezed in the middle, and 
the gamboge left capless. He 
ran to the stairwell and yelled 
for Captain Wully, who pres- 
ently appeared. 

‘T have here a letter — ” 

‘T didn’t do it,” Captain 
Wully protested. ** ’Twas 
Junior touched up the paint- 
ings. And ’twas Junior paint- 
ed Gertrude. Me? All I did 
was help Junior dry the paint 
and boost your prices a wee 
muckle.” 

“How much?” 



“By nothing at all, you 
might say. A zero on the 
end?” 

Jerry looked at the check. 
‘T feel like I’ve been obtaining 
money under false pretenses. 
Junior doesn’t even get any 
credit.” 

“But he does. Every one of 
those paintings was signed ‘J. 
Masterson-Junior.’ ” 

“I feel more honest about 
banking the check,” said Jer- 
ry. 

When he made out his de- 
posit slip and totaled his bank 
balance, Jerry reflected how 
quickly an inferiority com- 
plex can melt in financial sun- 
shine. He made a brief stop at 
the post office, where 'he 
mailed a check to the county 
assessor. He then headed 
straight for Heather Higgins’ 
front door. 

She had company. 

“Glad to know you.” Jerry 
acknowledged introduction to 
Wesley Tatom and stared 
with helpless fascination at 
the latter’s necktie — of Mac- 
Greggor plaid. 

“You arrived just in time to 
give me a little moral sup- 
port,” said Heather breathless- 

ly- 

“Now, Heather, we mustn’t 
bore Masterson with our per- 
sonal difficulties.” 

“I’ve started a story about 
Oscar the werewolf, but Wes- 
ley thinks — ” 

Wesley intei;-rupted. “I’m 
looking at it from a business 
standpoint. Some day I’ll step 
into my father’s shoes at the

bank. And what would the 
Board of Directors think of a 
bank president's wife who 
wrote claptrap about were- 
wolves and spare-rib glocken- 
spiels?" 

doubt if they’d think any- 
thing at all — particularly if it 
paid well," said Jerry, and 
stared at Wesley Tatom’s tie. 
The knot had begun to ease 
gently. 

‘Tf she thinks she wants to 
write, why can’t she stick to 
covered wagons, and — " 

“How stuffy of you!’’ said 
Heather. 

Wesley Tatom felt uncer- 
tainly of his tie, tightened the 
knot. 

“As a matter of curiosity," 
Jerry addressed his rival, 
“what makes you so sure 
Heather is going to marry 
you?" 

“It’s one of those taken-for- 
granted matters. We’ve gone 
together since — say ! What 
business is it of yours, any- 
way !” 

Now Heather, too, was 
watching Wesley’s necktie. 

“I don’t think women like to 
be taken for granted," Jerry 
said. 

One end of the necktie be- 
came longer and longer as its 
opposite end shortened. With 
a final but quiet jerk, the 
necktie came free, hesitated 
for a moment opposite Wes- 
ley’s belt buckle, then folded 
itself neatly and floated away. 

Heather giggled. “Were you 
laughing at me?” Wesley de- 
manded. ■ 



“Heather," said Jerry, “will 
you marry me?” 

In the free-for-all that fol- 
lowed, nobody settled any- 
thing. 

A ll that occurred some 
time ago, of course. Mean- 
while, what collector hasn’t 
heard of J. Masterson- Junior, 
whose canvases are lauded for 
their “other world" quality? 
And, if you have children, you 
probably know by heart the 
little book chronicling the 
fortunes and misfortunes of 
Oscar, the werewolf who 
fainted at the sight of blood. 
And there’s Harriet, the 
hodag. And Gary, the stone- 
eating gyascutus. And Robert, 
the sidehill gouger. 

Recently in print is a story 
of Oscar’s love for Vi, the 
Vitiated Vampire. 

Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Master- 
son are widely respected. She 
writes the books. He illus- 
trates them in his spare time. 
Such a delightfully zany cou- 
ple ! Always joking about a 
Scottish sea captain who lives 
in the attic and is married to 
an Indian princess. 

No wonder the Masterson 
children are overly imagina- 
tive — warning their playmates 
not to sit on Gertrude, not to 
step on Oscar’s tail. But all 
kids go through a phase like 
that. Only a few of them are 
lucky enough to grow up and 
make money out of it — lots of 
highly respectable money — 
like the Mastersons. END

IF • Short Story 



MISRULE 



Glen Wheatley thanked his lucky stars for bis good fortune 
every day of his life . every day, that is, but one! 



by ROBERT SCOTT 



T he brick smashed through 
the window and skittered 
across the top of Glen Wheat- 
ley’s desk. He had already 
removed most of the break- 
ables, but it caught a large 
plastic ash tray and sent it 
caroming off his cheekbone. 
A thin trickle of blood crept 
down his face. 

“Good God, aren’t they 
starting a little early this 
year?” Bert Hillary, who 
shared Wheatley’s office, was 
obviously not expecting an 
answer. He had been making 
it clear for the past hour 
(they had all got to their 
desks an hour earlier for this 
day) that he was an old 
hand, while this was Glen’s 
first experience of People’s 
Day. 



Glen knew that Hillary had 
been in the Civil Service only 
five or six years. He himself 
could hardly be accused of 
being an expert on the every- 
four-years Day. Still, he 
waited for the older man to 
make the first move. 

Hillary got up and peered 
cautiously out the shattered 
windov/. “Yeah, they’re al- 
ready boiling around the out- 
er wall like yeast in a vat. 
That guy with the brick must 
have quite a pitching arm.” 
Sweat stood out on his fore- 
head. He was clearly much 
more frightened than he pre- 
tended to be. 

Glen noticed this with some 
satisfaction. At least, he 
wasn’t the only one. “Come 
on, Wheatley. Us lower-level 



39 





boys have got to be on the 
hop. You’d be surprised how 
fast that mob can get up 
here.” 

Glen unfolded the map of 
Government House that had 
been placed on his desk that 
morning. He stared grimly at 
it, dabbing at his cheek with 
a rather grubby handkerchief 
meanwhile. The bleeding did 
not show any signs of stop- 
ping. 

Hillary hurried to the door. 
'‘Come on !” He was openly 
nervous now. “It’s no good 
studying that map for safety- 
holes now. You should have 
been doing that ever since 
we got here this morning.’' 

As a matter of fact, Glen 
had been doing just that, 
whenever Hillary’s flow of 
words had momentarily run 
dry. But he had not yet got 
the location of all the nearby 
hidden cubbies clearly in his 
mind. “Government House is 
such a maze,” he said defen- 
sively. 

“And we’re damned lucky 
it is,” Hillary said from the 
doorway. “Anyway, how do 
you know that map you’ve got 
there isn’t just what they’ve 
been hawking in People’s 
Square all this past week?” 
He gave a slightly sick leer. 

“You know those maps are 
inaccurate. They’re just a 
sop, just to give the mob an 
extra t h r i 1 L Government 
House plants most of them.” 
He could sound like an old 
hand, too, Glen thought with 
a certain smugness. 



“Nuts to that. Some of them 
are amazingly accurate. There 
are a hell of a lot of non-Gov- 
ernment people in here from 
year to year, and some of 
them aren’t here just on busi- 
ness. Let’s get going.” Hillary 
pulled Glen through the door, 
and then locked it. Glen 
raised his eyebrows at this. 
“Oh, sure,” his co-worker 
said wryly. “Gives the People 
something to v/ork off steam 
on.” He patted the flimsy 
door. “This will cave in un- 
der a few hard shoulders. 
Not like the safety-hole pan- 
els. We hope.” 

“But they don’t unlock for 
another half hour in this 
area.” 

“Thirty-eight minutes, to be 
exact,” Hillary said, glancing 
at his watch. “And of course 
the ones deeper in and higher 
up open even later. We’re 
supposed to give them a run 
for their taxes.” 

T he corridor was emptying 
out rapidly. Glen could 
hear smashing noises from 
the ground floor. 

Apparently the People were 
already in the building, be- 
ginning their day of destruc- 
tion. He thought gratefully 
of his private apartment, 
tucked away in the impreg- 
nable heart of Government 
House. Of course, it was 
closed off to him too on this 
day; but at least it was safe 
from the mob. They would get 
mainly the chaff to destroy. 
“I’m heading for the upper 



by ROBERT SCOTT 




levels/^ Hillary said. “Even if 
the safeties open later up 
there, it takes longer for the 
mob to penetrate. There’s 
enough breakable and burn- 
able stuff at the first few lev- 
els to keep them busy for a 
while. Coming?” 

Glen had just seen Joan 
Bourne emerge from her of- 
fice and lock the door. He 
headed toward her. “I’m go- 
ing to stay near some out-of- 
the-way safety in this area and 
hop in when it first opens. I 
don’t feel like running from 
the People,” he called back 
with a bravado he did not real- 
ly feel. 

“Suit yourself.” Hillary was 
already at the stairs. He 
paused for a moment. “And 
good luck.” 

“Thanks,” Glen said. “Good 
hiding.” 

Joan had been listening, and 
met him in the middle of the 
corridor. “I think you’ve got 
the right idea, Glen. Want 
some company?” 

He smiled, and brushed her 
cheek with his lips. “You 
know the answer to that, Joan. 
For life.” 

“This is Hardly the day to 
bring that up again.” She took 
his arm, and they turned off 
down a side corridor. “Be- 
sides, I thought our relation- 
ship was very nice as it is,” 
she pouted. 

“It is. I’m just greedy.” 

The side passageway took 
them deeper into the labyrinth 
that was Government House. 
Glen had hardly ever been out 



of it. He had been born and. 
brought up in the great ce;n- 
tral area that surrounded Gov- 
ernment Park, now sealed off 
from both the People and the 
Civil Servants. Apart from a 
vacation trip to another city’s 
Government House, this had 
been Glen’s entire world. And 
two years ago he had passed 
the Examinations and become 
a full-fledged CS, with all the 
privileges — and perils, he was. 
now realizing — that that en- 
tailed. 

They turned into another 
corridor, went past a bank of 
elevators — turned off for the 
day, as all the elevators were 
in the official section of the 
building — and went up a long 
flight of stairs.'^ 

Glen stopped at the third 
level. 

“This looks like as good a 
spot as any to wait for the 
first safety-holes to open. It’s 
out of the way. And there’s a 
hole right here, according to 
the map. It’ll be opening in 
twenty minutes. The mob 
should be busy down there for 
longer than that.” They locat- 
ed the almost invisible key 
square, and Glen pressed his 
Class-6 key to it. “Just on the 
chance they might have given 
us a break,” he said half 
apologetically. 

“Apparently they haven’t,” 
Joan murmured. “Let’s see if 
my Class-5 has any better 
luck.” She pressed her own 
key to the square, but the pan^ 
el still refused to slide back. 
Class-5 sliehers in this area

were often combined with 
those for Class 6. 

G len looked at her quiz- 
zically. “Joan, we gradu- 
ated at the same time, and 
you’re already Class-5 — Job 
Consultation — while I’m still 
Class-6 — Secondary School 
Allocation. How do you do 
it?” 

“Brains, personality and tal- 
ent. Hadn’t you noticed?” She 
pressed close to him. 

He kissed her. “Mmm, yes. 
But I still don’t see. ...” 
“Darling,” she said, “Joan 
Bourne is a young lady des- 
tined to go far. And fast.” 
“You seem so different 
from the other girls here 
though, Joan/” He blushed. 
“You didn’t happen to come 
from... Outside. Er...from 
the People, that is?” 

“I grew up in Block 6, Sec- 
tion A, overlooking the statue 
of Martyr Sherman Adams in 
Government Park. Just two 
blocks down from you, if I 
remember your records cor- 
rectly.” 

“You’ve had access to my 
records?” 

“Class-5 always does to 
Class-6’s. And I took a special 
interest in you, my dear.” She 
stroked his cheek. 

“Then you’re forgiven the 
snooping,” Glen smiled. “But 
to think I was being so polite 
and discreet about asking your 
origins !” 

“Not many take the Exams 
and come to Civil Service 
from Outside any more, sweet. 



Just as not many from here 
decide to go out and try their 
luck in the big world. Gener- 
ally we stay on our side of the 
fence, and they stay on theirs. 
Except for the Day, of course. 
And then it’s all one-way 
traffic.” 

“But I’ve heard some CS 
people go Outside for their 
vacation. I never have, of 
course, but...” 

“Oh, yes, quite a few do. 
You’re taken in a CS plane 
to another Government House, 
where you won’t be known in 
the city outside. You are given 
appropriate papers and emerge 
from the House during busi- 
ness hours. You mingle with 
the People, just like one of 
them. And when vacation’s 
over, back to the House for 
Job Consultation or Welfare 
Benefits or whatever you 
want to trump up. Show your 
true papers, and you’re 
whisked back to your own 
cozy womb.” She smiled remi- 
niscently. “Outside is an in- 
teresting experience.” 

This annoyed Glen obscure- 
ly. He put his arm around her. 
“I don’t want you going Out- 
side again. At least, not with- 
out me.” 

“Oh, the People are just 
people. Except for today...” 

well, the Bourne 
from which no traveler 
returneth! Hope I’m not in- 
terrupting anything, my dear. 
Anything important, that is.” 
At this unexpected voice, 
Glen let go of Joan and spun 



42 



by ROBERT SCOTT 




to face the intruder. It was a 
Class-2 High Official named 
Duckpath, whom he had heard 
speak at a few Government 
banquets. He dropped his 
fists, which he had uncon- 
sciously raised. 

‘'Mustn’t be so nervous, 
young man,” Duckpath said, 
swaying slightly. He was ob- 
viously quite drunk. ‘^How are 
you, joanie?” He patted her 
rump affectionately and gave 
her a smacking kiss. Joan 
looked both annoyed and 
amused. Glen flushed, but said 
nothing. 

After a moment of contem- 
plating the new arrival, Joan 
said, “Well, Ducks, what 
brings you down to the lower 
echelons?” 

‘‘Oh, pleasure, pleasure, my 
dear. Wanted to see all the 
fun and games. Usually pretty 
dull on top, you know.” He 
winked at her, then cocked an 
ear. ‘‘Sounds like the rabble 
are getting warmer, too.” 

Glen listened, and realized 
he had been hearing all along 
a dim muttering which was 
now clearly getting louder. A 
distinct crash sounded, and he 
was sure he smelled smoke. 

“Come on, Joan,” he said, 
tugging at her arm. “Let’s get 
into the shelter. It must be 
time now.” 

“Young man, you are obstre- 
perous, aren’t you?” Duckpath 
interposed himself between 
Glen and Joan. “Be calm, be 
calm. As you may know, my 
key will open any of the low- 
er echelon’s shelters, and at 



any time. Yours is not due to 
open for five minutes yet, for 
example, but at the touch of 
this — ” he flashed his Class-2 
key — “all barriers will fall 
before us. And I like the scent 
of danger. Just the scent, of 
course. Now — ” he motioned to 
Glen — “if you will just stand 
by that stairway, you will be 
able to see them in plenty of 
time for us all to get into 
shelter. You two shall be my 
guests. It will be very cozy.” 
He giggled. 

Glen scowled, but dki as he 
was told. 

It was true that the stairs 
were the obvious place for the 
onslaught. They led both up 
and down. He assumed Duck- 
path had come down them, but 
of course the People were still 
below, although apparently 
working their way rapidly to 
the stairs. The only other way 
up to this area was through 
one of the secret passageways, 
which the mob would not 
know about. 

Another crash echoed up 
the stairwell, much louder 
this time. A wisp of smoke 
curled lazily in the air in 
front of him. 

Glen fingered the caked 
blood on his cheek. Things he 
bad never questioned before 
seemed utterly meaningless 
and cruel now. His irritation 
with Duckpath bubbled over, 
and he said sourly, “What 
madness ! This whole proce- 
dure is incredibly stupid and 
wasteful.” 

Joan glanced at Duckpath 



MISRULE 



43 




with raised eyebrows^ but said 
nothing. That gentleman at 
first stiffened, then relaxed 
and said blandly, ‘T wouldn’t 
criticize the Government too 
much, my boy. It gives us all 
we have. And it can take it 
away also.” He smiled. ”This 
is not madness, but sheer sani- 
ty. You must have been ne- 
glecting your Political Science 
courses.” 

”Sanity ! It’s murder and 
destruction,” Glen muttered. 

”You know very well, young 
man, that all that is being 
destroyed is easily replaced. 
Will be replaced tomorrow, in 
fact. Ours is an opulent, pro- 
ductive society.” Duckpath’s 
smile deepened into a smirk. 
”A11 the important documents, 
all the valuables, are safely 
locked away in the central sec- 
tion. And the good that is be- 
ing done today!” He became 
rapturous. “The People are led 
by us, led by the nose. We de- 
cide where they will go to 
school, where they will live, 
which job they will get, how 
many children they may have. 
Soon we will decide when 
they are to die. We have the 
power.” His eyes glistened. 

“And in return we give 
them security. The population 
is balanced, the country pro- 
ductive, the old cared for; 
there is medical service for 
all. Everything is arranged 
for the best by the great com- 
plex of Government Houses 
all over the world. Everything 
is in the hands of the Govern- 
ment.” Duckpath was panting 



slightly. “Everything is in our 
hands.” 

everything is so perfect, 

-*"why this?” Glen gestured 
toward the cloud of smoke 
seeping through the entrance 
to the stairway. 

“It’s only the office fur- 
nishings. The building itself 
won’t burn,” Joan murmured. 

Duckpath gave her a little 
squeeze. “Our callow young 
friend is talking about the ha- 
tred, I believe, Joanie. The 
urge of the People to destroy 
and kill. Well, it is only natu- 
ral.” He belched softly. 
“These People are aware that 
their lives are woven from 
threads held in Government 
House. And though they are 
well cared for, they resent it. 
They resent having to file 
into this building and be allo- 
cated to this and that. They 
want someone to take care of 
them, but they resent their 
loss of freedom. They resent 
our power. 

“So this is their day. It 
comes once every four years. 
The day that gives them the 
illusion that they have some 
control over us, the day of 
Mob Rule. This is the day 
they can express all their 
locked-up frustrations, all 
their fury at the State which 
feeds and clothes them and 
watches over them. They can 
batter down and smash and 
burn.” Duckpath stared at 
Glen and seemed to sober a 
little. “Yes, they can even 
kill. They cannot bring guns 



by ROBERT SCOTT 




or knives here, but they can 
use fire and fists and stones. 
And that is even better for 
boiling away their hostilities. 
The hotheads among the Peo- 
ple will go so far as to kill, 
and that will cool them. But 
they will get only the fumble- 
fingered and feeble-witted. 
The rest will take care of 
themselves.” He paused for a 
moment, breathless. ”Do you 
realize we haven’t had even 
the sniff of a revolution in 
four hundred years? No civil 
strife at all. No charge of any 
kind.” He laughed. “This is 
Sheep’s Day. .their day to be 
wolves.” 

“Glen, you’d better watch 
the stairs,” Joan said, her face 
taut. 

Glen started. Duckpath’s 
harangue had distracted him, 
and somehow chilled him too. 
He peered down the stairwell. 
There were People at the end 
of the lower corridor, milling 
around and shouting. 

“We’ve got to get to shel- 
ter,” he said, hurrying toward 
Joan. 

Duckpath began to talk 
again. “This is nothing new. 
The Romans had a word for 
it, and a day for it, too. A day 
when the laws were abandoned 
and society was turned upside 
down. A day when the people 
cast off the bonds of civiliza- 
tion and order. A day of Mis- 
rule. They even had a King of 
Misrule. I rather like that. I 
might be such a King.” He 
struck a pose. “King of Mis- 
rule !” He turned with a grand 



gesture to Joan. “And you 
are my...” 

A rock crashed against the 
side of his head. Another ex- 
ploded on the wall next to 
Glen. 

“The secret passageways, 
Glen!” Joan screamed. 
“They’ve come up the other 
way. The maps must have 
been accurate this time.” 

There was a knot of men at 
the far bend of the corridor. 
They carried torches, and 
clumps of stones in sacks at 
their waists. Obviously they 
were not the dilettantes of 
People’s Day. They were af- 
ter more than the crash of fur- 
niture. 

“Get the dame, boys!” one 
of them yelled. They charged 
forward. Duckpath was lying 
across the entrance to the 
shelter, and the mob was al- 
most on him. 

“We’ve got to take the stair- 
way, Joan!” Glen cried, fum- 
bling at her arm. 

“His key, his key!” She 
knelt beside Duckpath and 
pulled the key out of his 
hand. The High Official 
stirred, but did not speak. An 
amazing amount of blood had 
already accumulated on the 
floor around him. 

A brick grazed Glen’s shoul- 
der, sending him spinning 
toward the stairway. Joan 
rushed after him, and they 
pounded the stairs together. 
“I can get in anywhere with 
this,” she gasped, holding up 
the key. 



MISRULE 




Presumably the half-con- 
scious Duckpath had made the 
oncoming men pause. Ripping 
sounds could be heard, and a 
horrible strangled cry. They 
were relieving the High Offi- 
cial of his personal belong- 
ings — and probably of his life. 

But the People from the 
floor below were now surging 
up the stairs, joined by four 
men from the crowd that had 
first seen Joan. “Get the 
dame! Government meat !'• 
The cry came booming up to 
Glen and Joan. 

They stumbled into the cor- 
ridor at the next landing, real- 
izing they would never make 
it up the next flight before 
the mob reached them. They 
were both fumbling with 
their maps. “There’s a small 
Class-3 right around here,” 
Joan waved her map in his 
face. She raced along the wall 
for a few yards and then 
clapped Duckpath’s key to it. 
A panel slid back and she 
slipped inside. “Thank God!” 
She glanced around her. “Dar- 
ling, it’s only a single. Too 
bad.” 

There was obviously no 
room for another person, Glen 
saw with dismay. Joan and 
the air-freshening apparatus 
took up all the space. 

“Hurry and find another, 
sweets.” She pitched him the 
Class-2 key, and blew him a 
kiss as the door slid shut. It 
would open again only after 
sundown, when People’s Day 
was officially over. 

A mass of screaming People 



burst from the stairway, and 
raised a great shout on seeing 
Glen. He dashed down the cor- 
ridor, turned left, and then 
turned right at the next pas- 
sageway. He was in a long cor- 
ridor ending in a large win- 
dow opening on the outside. 

Glen squinted at his map 
through eyes that refused to 
focus. He suddenly realized 
they were streaming with 
tears. 

There was a Class-4 shelter 
several paces along on the 
left. He rushed to it and 
pressed the High Official’s 
key to the square. A dim red 
light glowed through the 
plastic of the key. Full. 

He pounded on the panel. 
Of course it was soundproof. 
Of course the shelter was 
full of wise Civil Servants. 
Only the fumble-fingered and 
the feeble-witted, only the 
chaff... 

The People came pouring 
around the corner as Glen 
backed toward the end of the 
corridor. A stone sang past 
him and smashed through the 
window. Another caught him 
in the ribs. He backed faster, 
now completely blinded by 
tears. The growl of hatred 
from the mob grew louder. A 
heavy blow struck his collar- 
bone and he lurched backward. 
His knees caught, and then 
he was flipping over. Out and 
down. 

He sailed through the air. 

The pressure of the mob was 
gone. There was no time to 
think. There was just an cx-

hilarating sense of flight, of 
space, of freedom.

...AND BESIDES 
THOSE BOMBS... 



W E entered World War I 
with a number of active 
cavalry detachments. We en- 
tered World War II with a 
great many spruce-sparred, 
fabric-covered biplanes. In 
each case there were old-line 
specialists who fought like the 
devil to keep what was dem- 
onstrably obsolete, old-line of- 
ficers, who persisted in fight- 
ing the last war this time with 
the last war's methods. Be- 
cause it all happened in our 
time, it is difficult to get de- 
tached enough to realize that a 
modern war stimulates not 
only production, but invention 
and design. In eighteen 
months this country built 
more ships and planes than it 
would have, in normal times, 
in half a century; and that 
further, the B-29 (of which 
we built thousands) was a de- 



sign-century ahead of the old 
Keystone bombers, of which 
we had some dozens in 1939. 

You'd think that by now 
we'd realize that a new war, 
or even a sharp intensification 
of the cold war, will bring 
about even more drastic devel- 
opments. Technological ad- 
vances don't occur arithmeti- 
cally, in a straight slant like 
a cellar door; they occur geo- 
metrically, in a curve like a 
ski-jump slope or Mr. Robert 
Hope's famous nose. At this 
writing the general public 
seems to have a sort of numb 
idea that a new war would be 
something like the last, with 
something or other called fall- 
out added, and no conception 
at all of the fact that a 100 
megaton H-bomb has the pow- 
er of five thousand of the 
eggs we laid on Hiroshima 



48 





and Nagasaki. Most impor- 
tantly, there’s so much talk 
about the Big Bombs that wy 
seem to have lost sight com- 
pletely of the array of totally 
novel weapons which are cer- 
tain to emerge, just as the 
bazooka and the P-40 and the 
H-bomb itself emerged last 
time. 

Let’s take a look at some of 
them — devices now ixi actual 
existence, or under develop- 
mental contract, or in other 
ways a-borning. 

THE LASER is a light-inten- 
sifier. Coupled with radar and 
a simple computing circuit, it 
can get off a flash, in a split 
second, which will put a hole 
in a tank as big as your head 
at 500 yards. Since this is a 
beam, not a missile of any 
kind, it travels at the speed of 
light and needs no corrections 
for windage or trajectory, and 
does not have to ‘‘lead” a mov- 
ing target. Its developers 
claim that even in its present 
primitive stage it can move 
a satellite 1000 miles out 
slightly off orbit. 

THE ATOMIC PISTOL, using 
slugs of californium, a rare 
radioactive metal which has 
a c h a i n-reaction-supporting 
critical mass of not much 
more than a .50-caliber bullet. 
It will hit with the force of 
10 tons of TNT. 

RADAR "DEATH RAYS." 

Present-day high-intensity ra- 



dars are carefully fenced and 
guarded lest they "fry” un- 
wary bystanders. The effect is 
protobly adaptable to weapon- 
ry. 

GASES. Aside from the 
many and varied specialized 
gases we wish we could forget 
about but which are already in 
the tanks, a “Miltown” gas has 
been suggested and probably 
has been formulated — some- 
thing which can send out more 
clouds of tranquilizer than an 
election campaign. 

ION BEAMS, and high-flux 
focused beams of particles 
other than ions — these too are 
in the “death-ray” department. 
The ion beam is a leading con- 
tender for outer-space propul- 
sion, which does not disqual- 
ify it one bit from being a 
lethal ray. 

BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, 
PRIMARY. Twenty or more 
diseases, some in intensified 
natural form, some mutated. 

BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. 
SECONDARY. The so-called 
hormone “poisons,” which can 
inhibit or de-control growth 
patterns in cereal and other 
plants, so that they fail to ma- 
ture, or come to seed, or per- 
haps die off. There is now a 
new possibility that the same 
sort of thing can be done by 
viruses. 

Along with these, there are 
plans afoot involving not so 



. • . AND BESIDES THOSE BOMBS . 



49 




much new weapons, but new 
uses for the weapons we have. 

For example, it is theorized 
that in certain areas of the 
earth’s crust where known 
geological faults exist, a res- 
onance might be set up by 
carefully calculated and timed 
impacts and, just as marching 
men can cause a bridge to col- 
lapse, these impulses might 
cause the fault to slip and 
generate an earthquake. 

Then there’s the tactic of 
the Disguised War, where 
prevailing winds could be 
made to carry some debilitat- 
ing but not deadly disease — 
mononucleosis, for example, 
which just makes you weak as 
a duck — for a year or two un- 
til you just had no resistance 
(of any kind) any more. 

S OME theoreticians have 
suggested non-radioactive 
dust bombs which might well 
sharply raise or lower the at- 
mospheric temperature. This 
could raise, havoc with Russia 
(and Canada incidentally) 
without bothering us too 
much. Russia, on the other 
hand, could without compunc- 
tion explode enough clean 



bombs in enough of the right 
places in the oceans, and so 
load the troposphere with ice 
crystals that the Pole would 
warm up and the melting ice 
would flood our coastal cities. 
Russia hasn’t got any coastal 
cities — not, that is, to compare 
with ours. 

Well... there are more we 
could mention here, and cer- 
tainly more too classified to 
have leaked through to us, and 
still naore which carry the 
‘‘Burn Before Reading” stamp 
and are unknown to all but a 
few in the upper inner circle, 
and again more which, as al- 
ways happens, would leap into 
being during a war or near- 
war. 

Reading down the list 
makes one wonder why no one 
seems to be pushing very hard 
for a strong program of 
meticulously performed, mu- 
tually inspected, gradual dis- 
armament. Perhaps the illiter- 
ate populations are too igno- 
rant, and the literate ones too 
apathetic, to make themselves 
heard. 

Or perhaps that solution is 
just too science-fiction-y for 
them! END

He was a mighty hunter. 

Trouble was, he was on the side of the beasts! 



DEADLY 

GAME 



by EDWARD WELLEN 



D eep in the dusk of the 
wood Jess Seely saw the 
beast’s pupils shine. 

He had been careful of eve- 
ry footfall and of every shift 
of his shotgun as he made his 
way through the forest. But 
they had got wind of him, 
they had been on his trail from 
the instant he stepped into the 
wood, they were all around 
him now. The eyes vanished, 
but he could hear soft scurry- 
ings. 

Move quietly and keep your 
eyes open; that was the first 
lesson he had learned and the 
best. He moved still deeper 
into the wood, years of wood- 
craft in every move. The years 
had slowed him. But the ex- 
perience gained in those same 
years had made every move 



tell. He heard soft scurryings. 
They were stalking him. How 
would they try to get him this 
time? 

He let the shotgun dangle 
carelessly so the barrels 
threatened himself. 

Would that fempt one of 
them — a squirrel ?— to leap 
from a limb, ainiing to strike 
at the trigger apd set off the 
shot? No, he sqw it now. They 
had something else in wait 
just ahead. A deadfall. 

Only at the last fraction of 
a second did his sweep of eye 
take in the one bit of beaver 
track they had failed to brush 
away. 

He walked slowly on, strain- 
ing for sign of trip wire. It 
would be a length of vine; he 
should spot it by its dying 

51 





color. He should, but he did 
not. ,,He frowned. Was he 
guessing wrong? Then he 
spotted it — a length of living 
vine, one end still rooted, the 
other wrapping the trunk of a 
great spruce in a neat knot. 
The spruce itself seemed un- 
touched, at first sight. They 
had plastered the gnawings 
back in place, but to his eyes 
— now that he knew what he 
was looking for — there stood 
out enough difference be- 
tween the living wood and the 
dead to show the big bite they 
had taken out of the base of 
the tree. He admired their 
sense of balance. His lightest 
brush against the vine would 
bring the tree crashing down 
on him. 

To raise — then dash — their 
hopes, he tried to keep from 
letting on he had seen the set- 
up and went on without break- 
ing stride — then he length- 
ened and lifted his step at the 
last to miss triggering the trip 
wire by a hair. A silence, then 
a small chatter of disappoint- 
ment. 

He kept on. Under the talk- 
ing foliage of quaking aspen 
he made out other sounds. 
Soft scurryings. What would 
they have waiting ahead? A 
noose? No, poison-tipped 
thorns. 

T he rustle of leaves gave 
warning. He whirled aside. 
One of them — a raccoon? — 
loosed a bent branch of haw- 
thorn. The branch whipped at 
him and the wicked spikes 



barely missed his flesh. The 
branch was still trembling 
when he raised his shotgun 
but the raccoon — he felt sure 
it was a raccoon and smiled, 
remembering the first of them, 
Bandido— had vanished. Yet 
he had to make the futile ges- 
ture so those watching would 
not know the gun bore no 
load. He eyed the wicked 
spikes and again smiled. On 
each tip a sticky smear held 
a thick powdering. The pow- 
der would be dried leaves of 
foxglove. Or had they found 
something better? He smiled 
again at more chatter of frus- 
tratioii. 

But he sharpened his senses 
as he pushed on. He stopped 
where the going grew sudden- 
ly easy. They had cleared a 
path; it invited him to bypass 
a tangle of underbrush. He 
looked to see that the over- 
arching boughs did not hold 
loops of vine ready to drop, 
and took the path. Nothing. 
But there had to be some- 
thing. He pushed on, then 
slowed, smelling dampness 
that was not the dankness of 
mold. 

Ahead, the trail widened 
into a clearing. In the center 
of the clearing lay a patch of 
spongy ground that could be 
lethal quagmire. Yet the tracks 
of a big woodchuck led 
straight across the patch, 
promising the ground would 
hold. Something about the 
tracks gave Jess Seely pause. 
They had a dainty, yet drag- 
ging, look. 



52 



liy EDWARD WELLEN 




He read faint tracks on ei- 
ther side of the patch and 
knew what had taken place. 
Not one but three woodchucks 
had crossed the clearing to- 
gether, abreast, almost in step. 
Two had kept to the solid 
ground on either side of the 
bog, each holding in its jaws 
one end of a fallen tree limb. 
The big woodchuck in the 
middle had ridden with the 
bulk of his weight on that 
support, making footprints 
without sinking into the 
mire. 

Jess Seely smiled and skirt- 
ed the patch. 

He wondered vaguely why 
the chatter he heard now 
seemed to be chatter not of 
frustration but of expectation. 
He had no time for more than 
vague wonder at that, and at 
the sudden hush. The ground 
— not ground but a covering 
of dirt over a wickerwork of 
branches — gave under ^ him. 
His hands flung up, the gun 
shot out of his grip. He fell. 

H IS coming to was an in- 
and-out thing, pulsing 
awareness, intermitting dream. 
The pit was deep. They 
were good at digging. They 
had patience. He nodded, and 
blacked out. 

He came to again. He lay 
crumpled, a leg bent strangely 
under him. He was helpless, 
but they would not come right 
away. They would not trust 
him, they would wait to make 
sure he was not playing help- 
less. Then they would come. 



They had patience. 

He tightened himself 
against the pain. This was 
what he had worked toward, 
and in any case it would have 
been useless to have regrets. 
He had no regrets. He had 
been a good game warden. He 
lapsed into unconsciousness 
again, smiling. 

The wait was long and he 
knew he had passed through 
a spell of delirium. There was 
a timeless moment when it 
seemed to him he came aware 
in the past, reliving the start 
of it. That had been the time 
when, feeling a gnawing help- 
lessness, seeing the day com- 
ing when he would no longer 
be there to save them from 
his fellow man, he caught that 
poacher. The poacher was too 
busy to sense his approach, 
busy cursing some animal 
that had once again sprung 
the trap and made off with the 
bait. 

He knew, in that long-ago 
day, that it would be wasting 
time to haul the man into 
court. The local justice of the 
peace would let him off with 
a mild rebuke. So Jess Seely 
booted the man out of the 
wood, baited and reset the 
trap and lay in wait. 

At last a large raccoon 
nosed into view, picked up a 
piece of twig in a forepaw and 
reached cautiously to stick it 
into the trap. The trap 
snapped shut its grin on noth- 
ing. The raccoon v/as about to 
make off with the bait when 
Jess Seely remembered to 



DEADLY GAME 



S3 




move. He aimed his hypo- 
dermic gun and shot the rac- 
coon to sleep. He carried the 
raccoon home — and that was 
the start of Jess Seely’s pri- 
vate, unauthorized and top-se- 
cret psychological testing lab- 
oratory. 

The raccoon made an auspi- 
cious first subject, quickly 
mastering all sorts of release 
mechanisms to escape from 
puzzle boxes and to win re- 
wards, learning to fit pegs 
into holes and to tie knots. 
The one stupidity was Jess 
Seely’s. He had grown fond of 
the raccoon — Bandido — a n d 
he had let Bandido sense that. 
It was lucky Jess Seely had 
realized that at this early 
stage, or the whole thing 
would have gone for nothing. 
He had to break Bandido of 
his liking. He forced himself 
to set about coldly instilling 
in Bandido hate and fear of 
man — any man. 

Only when he felt sure he 
had brought that about did he 
free Bandido. He tagged 
Bandido and released him into 
the wild, then hunted other 
promising subjects. There was 
only one Bandido. Jess Seely 
did not give any of the others 
a name. 

He did not dare. 

He rigged more and more 
sophisticated release mecha- 
nisms, and in time was gradu- 
ating animals that were able 
to disarm any trap safely and, 
before making off with the 



bait, move the trap, reset it 
and conceal it so the original 
setter of the trap would step 
into it. Other than a shot from 
a trapper who thought the re- 
setting was his doing, Jess 
Seely had little trouble with 
poachers after that. 

A t mating seasons he used 
his capture-gun again to 
bring together the brightest 
of his subjects. And in thirty 
years, thanks to training and 
selective breeding, the wild- 
life under his protection had 
learned to deal with all traps, 
set out sentries, string alarm 
wires across trails, toss stones 
to mislead hunters and put 
hounds out of action and, with 
earth or urine, fight fire. 

Now he was clear in his 
mind and he felt a humble 
pride. He had set out to teach 
them to guard their preserve, 
to save themselves. He had 
done a good job of this. He 
had taught them well. He 
heard them coming closer to 
the rim of the pit. Now he 
saw their eyes. 

He fixed on one face. Old 
Bandido! But that couldn’t 
be. Old Bandido was long 
dead. This was a son or a 
grandson or a great-grandson. 
In a sense they were all chil- 
dren of Jess Seely. 

No matter. They would have 
no pity on him. He had 
taught them well indeed, he 
thought smiling,

THE HOPUTE 




They were the mightiest warriors the 
universe had ever known. All they . 
lacked was something to live for! 



By Richard 




Sheridan 



J ORD awoke to the purr of 
the ventilators billowing 
the heavy curtains at the 
doorway. Through them, 
from the corridor, seeped the 
cold, realistic, shadowless 
light that seemed to sap the 
color from man and matter 
and leave only drabness and 
emptiness. 

His eyes were sandy with 
sleep. He blinked. The optic 
nerves readied for sight, pu- 
pils focused, retina recorded. 
The primordial fear of un- 
familiar things disappeared 
as he recognized the objects 
in the room, identified wak- 
ing as a natural phenomenon 
and remembered the day’s 
objectives. 

He lay quietly on the pal- 
let ; dimly conscious of 



identity, clinging physically 
to the temporal death vanish- 
ing behind his opened eyes. 
Pale light, swollen bladder, 
sticky throat, quiescent body, 
unimportant hunger, dim fear 
of incipient living. 

He felt for the cigarettes 
on the floor beside his bed. 
His careful, sleepy fingers 
passed lightly over the ashy 
ashtray and fell on wrinkled 
cellophane. Dry tubes from a 
synthetic Virginia. He shook 
a cigarette from the pack and 
lay with it jutting from his 
lips. The steady, filtered, 
odorless breeze centered on 
his senseless frontal lobes and 
whispered down his silver 
checks, 

A light. His hand crawled, 
finger walking across the 

55 





crimson carpet to the group- 
ing, found the metal tube and 
flew back to his chest. He 
fumbled with the trigger. His 
muscles were lethargic and 
he pressed it hard with a 
childish impatience. 

Perseverance. 

Now the metal tip glowed 
orange as the radioactive 
motes in the tube destroyed 
themselves with rigid self- 
control. Careful suction, then, 
and a cubic foot of tobacco 
smoke howled down his esoph- 
agus into his lungs, examined 
each feathery cranny and left 
by muscular contraction. 

It tasted bad, but he’d ex- 
pected that it would. 

He didn’t have to smoke all 
of it. The habit decently re- 
quired only that he take a 
puff, leave it smolder, take 
another, allow himself to be 
scorched and futilely try to 
set the bed afire. 

He watched the smoke be- 
ing plucked from the air by 
the purifiers to be expelled 
with other smokes, smells and 
gases into an atmosphere that 
consisted of little else. 

H IS last night’s pleasure 
stirred, vainly fought 
the inevitable and fluttered 
its hands. “You awake. Sol- 
dier?” 

The room glowed with a 
rosy light. 

“Approximately.'' 

The woman uncoiled her- 
self and lay flat. Through the 
tangle of bronzed hair, one 
ear shone w h i t e 1 y. She 



brushed the hair from her 
eyes and her scarlet mouth 
opened in a feline yawn. The 
woman was pink and white; 
she quivered in voluptuous 
ecstasy and slithered on the 
satin with her own satiny, 
round and naked flesh. 

“I didn’t hear the alarm,” 
she said, her voice thick with 
the residue of sleep. Her 
body pressed warm to his as 
she slid his cigarette from his 
fingers. 

He shared the cigarette, 
thinking of the distance be- 
tween the bed and the bath- 
room. The clock told him he 
had eight minutes to wait for 
maximum emission. His phys- 
iological chart showed a tol- 
erance of nine and one-third 
hours. 

Eight minutes to wait. Then 
he would have twenty minutes 
in which to shower, and fif- 
teen to clothe himself in the 
shimmering, clinging opaque 
that, like the casing on a 
sausage, would cover him, 
leaving only his eyes, ears 
and mouth. These the neu- 
rologist would take care of 
before the mechanics fitted 
him into his machine for his 
next tour of duty. 

There was a time for eating, 
time for a last cigarette, time 
for briefing and a long, long 
time for the Galbth II. 

Time for everything but 
living. 

Gently he kissed the wom- 
an’s soft neck. “What’s your 
name?” he asked wistfully, 
his attention divided between 



56

the short gold hairs at the 
base of her head and the all 
important clock. 

The woman chuckled 
chidingly and toyed with his 
hands, tracing the veins that 
stood rigid on their backs 
where the tortured nerves 
had forced them to the sur- 
face like a maze of pale blue 
pipes. 

She did not answer. He 
could no more know her name 
than he could know her face 
behind the silver opaque — 
than he could know her voice 
behind the vocal distorter — 
no more than he could know 
anyone, or that anyone could 
know him. 

Three times a week the 
Sex-Dispatcher sent him a 
woman. For all he knew it 
could be the same woman, or 
three different women. 

‘‘Can I tell the dispatcher 
that I pleased you?" The 
voice distorter had shifted 
and made her sound as though 
she had a cold. It was, of 
course, impossible. That 
scourge hadn’t attacked the 
fortress in thirty years. In all 
probability it would never 
attack it again. 

He nodded, grinding the 
cigarette into the ashtray. “It 
would be nice,” he said, “if 
we could know one another.” 

She smiled. “Some day.” 

The clock gave warning, 
counting backwards through 
thirty seconds. Jord patted 
the woman’s thigh in dismiss- 
al. “You may as well go 
now.” 



S HE slid from the bed, 
neither reluctant nor im- 
patient. Her simple tunic lay 
on the crimson rug where she 
had dropped it nine hours be- 
fore. “Good-by, Soldier,” she 
said. 

He was already on his way 
to the bathroom. If he should 
see her again, her yoice would 
be different, her hair would 
be different. She had no scars 
or physical aberrance that he 
could recognize her by. She 
was healthy, intelligent and 
normal, and therefore selected 
for breeding. So was he. Ask 
the geneticists. He had. 

In the bathroom, the clock 
told him to wash his face. 
Carefully he rubbed desen- 
sitizer on his mask, on the ten 
thousand artificial nerve end- 
ings that transcribed every 
motion of the living tissue it 
encased and magnified that 
motion a thousand times to 
the mightier motions of the 
machine. 

The desensitizer entered 
the porous material; the mask 
sagged and became transpar- 
ent like a cellophane sack. He 
lifted it from his face. 

Two huge holes for eyes, 
a gaping rent of a mouth. He 
threw it with disgust into the 
depository. It would go back 
to the Neurological Division 
to be cleaned and repaired. 

He looked into the mirror 
with the interest of a man 
who sees his face on rare 
occasions. The nerves stood 
out like splintered cracks in 
glass. He fingered his face 

57 



THE HOPLITE 




lovingly, unmindful of the ag- 
ony caused by his touch, re- 
membering the woman. He 
wondered in what manner her 
face would differ from his. 

The pain made him stop 
thinking about it and he 
closed his eyes to spray a 
weak solution of desensitizer 
on the burning flesh. Almost 
immediately the pain was 
gone ; but it left him with a 
marble mask that wouldn’t 
come to life again until the 
effects of the desensitizer 
wore off. 

He washed quickly in warm 
water, rubbed disinfectant on 
the atrophied area, rinsed it 
and stepped in front of the 
dryer. A thousand tongues of 
almost corporeal warmth 
licked over his skin. 

He had shaved and desen- 
sitized his body the night be- 
fore, so it was only a matter 
of washing and disinfecting 
before he clinibed into the 
overall casing and stepped 
clumsily into the sensitizing 
shower. The huge bag began 
to shrink and cloud, adhering 
to his body as though it were 
another layer of his skin. 

Since the casing acted as a 
magnifying extension of his 
nervous and muscular sys- 
tems, his body, within the 
casing, felt nothing. There 
was no sense of contact as he 
walked aross the floor and 
opened the bathroom door. As 
far as feeling went, he was 
without a body. 

He said “hello” experimen- 
tally, to see if the distorter 



was still on. It wasn’t. The 
hard flatness of his voice sur- 
prised him. The rosy light 
was gone also. Something pe- 
culiar to women caused the 
filter to slide over the coldly 
glowing silver. No man could 
cause it. No warrior was sup- 
posed to want to. 

H e went through the cur- 
tains into the tube-like 
corridor and joined the oth- 
er silver warriors on their 
way to the mess hall. He 
knew no one of them, yet 
knew them all. In battle, no 
friend of his would die, yet 
no one would die that he did 
not know. Two hundred years 
of war in this forgotten bit 
of the universe had shown 
the value of this. Some day, 
if he lived to be old, he would 
become a civilian. Until then 
the only faces he would see 
would be his ov/n and those 
of the subnormal servers in 
the mess hall. He had no 
loyalties except to the for- 
tress. The fortress was his 
past, present and future. 

He nodded a greeting to his 
server. “How are you today, 
Teddy?” The voice distorter 
madp him a gentle baritone. 

The moron stared at him 
blankly, not understanding 
what was spoken, not caring. 
It was mentally impossible 
for him to care about anyone 
and psychologically impossi- 
ble for anyone to care about 
him. That was why he was 
allowed to serve in the mess. 
He set Jord’s rations before 



58 



by Richard Sheridan 




him in their plastic contain- 
ers. A scientific measure of 
calories, proteins, vitamins, 
minerals and hay-like rough- 
age. 

Jord wished the idiot was 
able to talk, but decided 
against holding a one-sided 
conversation with him. He 
used to do it quite often, 
taking pleasure in the shift- 
ing planes of his face, until 
he'd become sick with longing 
for a complete human being. 
He knew no one and only his 
psychiatrist knew him. The 
fortress was to him one com- 
plete body. 

The parts of that body 
could never be allowed to be- 
come more important than the 
total of those parts. It was 
the first thing a potential 
master of a Galbth II learned: 
The basic lesson in loneliness. 

He choked down the meas- 
ured kilograms of roughage, 
saving the concentrates until 
the last when he could suck 
out the synthetic flavoring 
and delude himself for a mo- 
ment that he was eating food. 
His fare consisted of the pre- 
cise amount necessary to keep 
him operating at maximum ef- 
ficiency and maintain opti- 
mum size. A two-pound var- 
iation in his weight would re- 
quire a refitting. 

He smoked his last ciga- 
rette for the day and then 
made his way to the third 
section briefing room. 

There were twelve warriors 
in his section. Except for mi- 
croscopic differences in their 



builds, there was little, if 
anything, to distinguish one 
from the other. They had no 
contact with anything as per- 
sonalized as officers. Each 
warrior was a separate unit. 
The centralization of author- 
ity was complete. There was 
only the loudspeaker to com- 
mand. For a time the warriors 
had been allowed to designate 
the voice as '‘The General," 
but it was soon discovered 
that they felt a particular 
loyalty to the name. The word 
was dropped. To designate 
authority, a warrior used the 
word: "Authority." This 
word also served as his offi- 
cial concept of politics. With 
all the strength of the for- 
tress in the warriors, this was 
to be desired. 

Simultaneously, the speaker 
and the large television screen 
below it came to life. 

T he scene showed one of 
the fortress’s carefully 
tilled roughage farnjs being 
looted by a large body of the 
natives — the enemy that was 
determined to erase the last 
remnant of an empire that 
once held the entire solar 
system in its grasp. That 
meant nothing to Jord. It was 
the faces — the faces that were, 
relatively, not even faces at 
all. Yet there were points of 
similarity within the gulf of 
difference — and the faces. 
Faces without masks! 

The voice called "Author- 
ity" was expressionless and 
precise. 



THE HOPLITE

^As you can see* a large 
and heavily armed contingent 
of the enemy has breached 
the dome of number seven 
surface-farm.” 

The scout obligingly 
swiveled his television optic 
to show the fused gap in the 
huge plastic dome through 
which the natives were haul- 
ing incendiary materials to 
destroy the crop. The motion- 
less bulk of a warrior lay 
close beside the opening. He 
had been downed by artillery, 
while above the force-field 
the ever present aircraft of 
the natives circled watchful- 
ly. Somewhere, the ancient 
generators had shorted long 
enough for the raiders to slip 
through. 

detachment has already 
been sent out,” the voice con- 
tinued. “The natives are to be 
forced back beyond the north- 
ern defense perimeter. Intelli- 
gence estimates eight hundred 
of the enemy and thirty field- 
pieces. The fortress depends 
on you. You will not fail the 
fortress.” 

On that note, the loudspeak- 
er was silent. 

‘Tt seems to me,” the war- 
rior on Jord’s right murmured 
as they moved towards the 
opening bulkhead at the far 
side of the room, ”that we 
almost always fail.” He wasn’t 
contradicting, only remark- 
ing. 

Jord nodded. One warrior 
lost today, two last week, one 
the week before, and more be- 
fore that. He saw the levia- 



thans, 140 tons of machinery 
with great gaping holes in 
their bodies, saw the wires 
and conduits, armor and all 
the intricacies that went into 
a Galbth II. He saw them 
steaming, stumbling, falling 
— respirators clogged — smoth- 
ering. Their motions weak- 
ened, their limbs failed, the 
warriors died. 

Two hundred years ago the 
planet had been a peaceful 
colony. Then with the col- 
lapse of the empire had come 
two hundred years of rever- 
sals, and they who had once 
been the overseers of harmless 
workers now found themselves 
struggling for the barest sur- 
vival. Only the workers, the 
natives, had adapted. 

He went through the bulk- 
head into the immenseness of 
the cavern where the machines 
stood waiting in the shadow- 
less light. 

Down the iron catwalks 
the silver warriors* ran. Down 
to the mechanics, down to the 
surgeons with their surgeon 
fingers dead white beneath 
the operating lamps. All 
waiting. Waiting to fit the 
mechanism for a thousand 
eyes to the optic nerves, the 
amplifiers to the audio. 

J ORD felt the familiar hor- 
ror. 

When you were fitted with 
the conduits for optics and 
audios, you lost all contact 
with reality. You became a 
consciousness in nothing. His 
great fear at this time was of 



60

falling. He seemed to fall for 
eons until the mechanics with 
steel hands slid him into his 
machine and, bit by bit, his 
body returned. 

Fingers, hands, wrists, arms, 
feet, legs, shoulders, back, 
neck, jaw, cheeks, nose, 
eyes — 

His cranial optics slid from 
their sockets within the blue 
steel skin of his head, and he 
looked down to the floor of 
the cavern, seventy feet be- 
low. 

‘‘Check motion?” 

He moved in the ritual bal- 
let. Seventy feet and 140 tons 
of steel and glass, copper and 
nickel, silver and plastic, and 
a man buried deep inside. 

The ultimate machine. The 
ultimate extension of a man. 

A ton of fist opened and 
closed, moved with effortless 
grace and fell to his side with 
enough power to crush a 
block of granite. His atomic 
muscles turned silently when 
he walked. His legs of flesh 
commanding legs of steel. He 
could walk two hundred miles 
an hour or run five times that 
fast. He could thread a needle 
with his fingers, or rip 
through a mountain. 

“Check respirators.” 

“Check.” 

The technicians scurried 
from the cavern floor. The 
all-clear sounded and the roof 
slid open and a ramp grew 
up from the floor. 

His voice echoed through 
the cavern, mingling with the 
voices of the other warriors* 



Joyous, thankful voices — the 
horror had passed and they 
were alive again. 

On the surface it was win- 
ter. The m e t h a n e-frosted 
ground beneath the machines 
was like iron. Iron against 
steel feet rang in the heavy 
air. Wispy tendrils of steam 
rose from the great bodies. 
The respirators sucked and 
transformed ammonia and 
methane. The great feet left 
imprints in earth and ^tone. 

Jord exulted in the freedom 
of the surface, iw the long 
vistas of unwalled space, in 
the curve of a far away hori- 
zon. He exulted in his machine 
body, so human in its parts, 
so more than human in its 
size and capabilities. The 
column of the neck, the steel 
sinews ; every muscle, every 
ligament, every nerve of the 
human body had its counter- 
part in the machine. What 
man could do, the machine 
did. What affected man, in 
proportion, affected the ma- 
chine. 

Even to pain, the machine 
was complete. 

He withdrew his optics and 
sent his telescope rising ten 
feet above his head, searching 
the gray land for the other 
detachment. A dozen miles 
away he could see the dome 
of the ravished farm. The 
little specks were scurrying 
to complete their destruction 
before the dreaded warriors 
should appear. They had 
blocked the entrance of the 
shallow valley in which the 



THE HOPLITE 



61 




farm lay with their artillery. 
Behind it the gunners would 
try to hold off the warriors 
and give the rest time to es- 
cape. Not that it mattered. 
The enemy cared little for 
his losses. 

His telescope swiveled, 
found the scarp of an ancient 
bomb, ringed with what was 
probably fission produced ob- 
sidian, and rested on the bod- 
ies of the machines who had 
beaten his detachment to the 
scene and now came stream- 
ing out to join them. 

The two detachments 
merged, hesitated as each 
warrior assumed his position 
and began the attack. 

They would charge straight 
at the guns, so much a war- 
rior cared for the marksman- 
ship of former slaves — so 
much a warrior cared for the 
power of native shells. 

AT eight miles the snouts 
of the cannons began to 
belch. The gunnery was high. 
The barrage passed harmless- 
ly overhead. 

The first strike was for 
him. The armor-piercing shell 
clanged and flattened out 
against his chest, staggering 
him back. He rallied, caught 
his balance, sped on. He al- 
most pitied the limited in- 
ventiveness of the natives, 
whose genius ended when 
they drove man into the for- 
tresses. 

Another shell. A warrior 
whirled and stumbled. Jord 
crashed into him^ steadied 

62 



him. The explosions blended 
into an endless sound. 

He felt a shell bounce from 
his shoulder, taking six op- 
tics with it and leaving the 
smell of scorched steel. They 
were too thick now to dodge, 
too close to bear. Earth and 
stone sprayed up from a sud- 
den crater before him. He 
wheeled. Now they were in a 
range where the shells could 
disable an arm or leg. 

An arm! A stiff-hung, mo- 
tionless limb of steel. 

The rush had brought them 
to the artillery. Their feet 
trampled the ancient guns. 
They smashed at belching 
muzzles with hammer fists. 
They had breached the de- 
fenses. The natives had fled. 
In minutes they would be 
trampling the fleeing enemy. 

Then the earth erupted... 

Jord had only one leg still 
functioning when he regained 
consciousness. One leg and 
perhaps eight of his optics. 
His audio was dead and there 
was something wrong with 
his respirator. He had to fight 
to keep down the panic. 

A warrior who had been 
trapped inside his machine 
once told him what it was 
like inside a Galbth II when 
you couldn’t move, or help 
yourself. If you but closed 
your eyes you imagined your- 
self inside a shell, and that 
shell inside a larger shell, 
and that inside a still larger 
shell until, after a hundred 
shells, you could imagine 
your machine, still true to 

by Richard Sheridan 




your form, lying helpless and 
twisted on the ground. 

There was no way you 
could get out of your ma- 
chine without the help of the 
mechanics. Even if there were 
it' was impossible to exist on 
the surface. You had to lie 
where you fell. Or, if possi- 
ble, make your way back as 
best you could to your lock. 

He tried moving. His good 
leg sawed the air like a giant 
flail. There was some motion 
in his chest, but that was all. 
He erected all the optics he 
could control and found him- 
self lying on his stomach, dis- 
membered. About twenty 
yards to the right he saw the 
other leg of his machine ly- 
ing across a warrior who 
seemed to have no motion at 
all. As far as he could see, no 
one had escaped. Warriors 
and parts of warriors were 
strewn all about him. He 
swiveled his optics in anxi- 
ety. If he were to be rescued, 
it must be soon. Already the 
air was foul and he was hav- 
ing trouble focusing his op- 
tics. 

He wanted to get out of the 
machine. He never wanted 
anything as much as he want- 
ed this. The smell of metal 
and the taste of metal stran- 
gled him. He wanted to get 
out. Worse than he wanted 
faces, worse than he wanted 
identity, worse than he want- 
ed to be able to live on the 
surface. He could feel all the 
weight of the machine on his 
body. The vocalizer was still 
THE HOPLITE 



on and he moaned into the 
dirt. 

He tried to raise his optics 
again, but the power had 
somehow failed. Many-faced, 
congealing darkness drew 
near. He rushed into it. 

T he Genocide Squad was 
the first to go into the 
crater. 

The last warrior had ceased 
moving. Later the salvagers 
would come to collect the pre- 
cious metals. They drilled 
Jord’s machine open but, 
luckily, by this time he was 
dead. 

“Which one next?’' he 
asked, clambering awkward- 
ly from the hole in* the ma- 
chine's back. He was a native 
and, except for certain func- 
tional differences in his con- 
struction, was little distin- 
guished from other natives. 
But normalcy is relative. The 
normalcy of a native may be 
radically different from that 
of a fortress dweller. 

“We are fortunate the 
bomb didn’t destroy more of 
these b o d i e s," he said, re- 
joining his partner at the side 
of the warrior. 

“What is it like, inside?" 
his partner asked curiously. 

The Genocide Monitor 
stopped for a moment and ap- 
praised the vast bulk. He had 
long ago ceased to be either 
fascinated or repelled by the 
soft, unfunctional bodies of 
fortress dwellers. 

“Just another human," the 
android said. END

S ILENTLY, so as not to 
shock anyone with illu- 
sions about well dressed 
young women, Sandra Lea 
Grayling cursed the day she 
had persuaded the Chicago 
Space Mirror that there would 
be all sorts of human interest 
stories to be picked up at the 
first international grandmas- 
ter chess tournament in which 



an electronic computing ma- 
chine was entered. 

Not that there weren't 
enough humans around, it was 
the interest that was in doubt. 
The large hall was crammed 
with energetic dark-suited 
men of whom a disproportion- 
ately large number were bald, 
wore glasses, were faintly un- 
tidy and indefinably shabby,

USCF, USSF, USSR and 
UNESCO. Sandra felt fairly 
sure about the last three. 

The many clocks, bedside 
table size, would have struck 
a familiar note except that 
they had little red flags and 
wheels sprinkled over their 
faces and they were all in 
pairs, two clocks to a case. 
That Siamese-twin clocks 
should be essential to a chess 
tournament struck Sandra as 
a particularly maddening cir- 
cumstance. 

H er last assignment had 
been to interview the 
pilot pair riding the first 
American manned circum-lu- 
nar satellite — and the five al- 
ternate pairs who hadn’t made 
the flight. This tournament 
hall seemed to Sandra much 
further out of the world. 

Overheard scraps of con- 
versation in reasonably intel- 
ligible English were not par- 
ticularly helpful. Samples: 
“They say the Machine has 
been programmed to play 
nothing but pure Barcza Sys- 
tem and Indian Defenses — and 
the Dragon Formation if any- 
one pushes the King Pawn.” 
“Hah! In that case. .” 

“The Russians have come 
with ten trunkfuls of prepared 
variations and they’ll gang up 
on the Machine at adjourn- 
ments. What can one New Jer- 
sey computer do against four 
Russian grandmasters?” 

“I heard the Russians have 
been programmed— -with hyp- 
notic cramming and somno- 



briefing. Votbinnik had a 
nervous breakdown.” 

“Why, the Machine hasn’t 
even a Haupturnier or an in- 
tercollegiate won. It’ll over its 
head be playing.” 

“Yes, but maybe like Capa 
at San Sebastian or Morphy 
or Willie Angler at New 
York. The Russians will look 
like potzers.” 

“Have you studied the 
scores of the match between 
Moon Base and Circum-Ter- 
ra?” 

“Not worth the trouble. The 
play was feeble. Barely Ex- 
pert Rating.” 

Sandra’s chief difficulty 
was that she knew absolutely 
nothing about the game of 
chess — a point that she had 
slid over in conferring with 
the powers at the Space Mir- 
ror, but that now had begun 
to weigh on her. How wonder- 
ful it would be, she dreamed, 
to walk out this minute, find 
a quiet bar and get pie-eyed 
in an evil, ladylike way. 

“Perhaps mademoiselle 
would welcome a drink?” 

“You’re durn tootin’ she 
would!” Sandra replied in a 
rush, and then looked down 
apprehensively at the person 
who had read her thoughts. 

It was a small sprightly eld- 
erly man who looked like a 
somewhat thinned down Peter 
Lorre — there was that same 
impression of the happy Slavic 
elf. What was left of his white 
hair was cut very short, mak- 
ing a silvery nap. His pince- 
nez had quite thick lenses. 



hy FRITZ LEIBER 




But in sharp contrast to the 
somberly clad men around 
them, he was wearing a pearl- 
gray suit of almost exactly the 
same shade as Sandra’s — a cir- 
cumstance that created for her 
the illusion that they were fel- 
low conspirators. 

‘'Hey, wait a minute,” she 
protested just the same. He 
had already taken her arm and 
was piloting her toward the 
nearest flight of low wide 
stairs. “How did you know I 
wanted a drink?” 

“I could see that mademoi- 
selle was having difficulty 
swallowing,” he replied, keep- 
ing them moving. “Pardon me 
for feasting my eyes on your 
lovely throat.” 

“I didn’t suppose they’d 
serve drinks here.” 

“But of course.”. They were 
already mounting the stairs. 
“What would chess be with- 
out coffee or schnapps?” 
“Okay, lead on,” Sandra 
said. “You’re the doctor.” 
“Doctor?” He smiled wide- 
ly. “You know, I like being 
called that.” 

“Then the name is yours as 
long as you want it — Doc.” 

M eanwhile the happy 

little man had edged 
them into the first of a small 
cluster of tables, where a 
dark-suited jabbering trio was 
just rising. He snapped his 
fingers and hissed through 
his teeth. A white-aproned 
waiter materialized. 

“For myself black coffee,” 
he said. “For mademoiselle 



rhine wine and seltzer?” 

“That’d go fine.” Sandra 
leaned back. “Confidentially, 
Doc, I was having trouble 
swallowing. .well, just about 
everything here.” 

He nodded. “You are not 
the first to be shocked and 
horrified by chess,” he as- 
sured her. “It is a curse of 
the intellect. It is a game for 
lunatics — or else it creates 
them. But what brings a sane 
and beautiful young lady to 
this 64-square madhouse?” 

Sandra briefly told him her 
storv and her predicament. By 
the time they were served. 
Doc had absorbed the one and 
assessed the other. 

“You have one great advan- 
tage,” he told her. “You know 
nothing whatsoever of chess — 
so you will be able to write 
about it understandably for 
your readers.” He swallowed 
half his demitasse and 
smacked his lips. “As for the 
Machine — you do know, I sup- 
pose, that it is not a humanoid 
metal robot, walking about 
clanking and squeaking like a 
late medieval knight in ar- 
mor?” 

“Yes, Doc, but...” Sandra 
found difficulty in phrasing 
the question. 

^ “Wait.” He lifted a finger. 
‘T think I know what you’re 
going to ask. You want to 
know why, if the Machine 
works at all, it doesn’t work 
perfectly, so that it always 
wins and there is no contest. 
Right?” 

Sandra grinned and nodded. 



THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE

Dot’s ability to interpret her 
mind was as comforting^ as the 
bubbly, mildly astringent mix- 
ture she was sipping. 

He removed his pince-nez, 
massaged the bridge of his 
nose and replaced them. 

/If you had,” he said, ‘'a 
billion computers all as fast 
as the Machine, it would take 
them all the time there ever 
will be in the universe just to 
play through all the possible 
games of chess, not to men- 
tion the time needed to classi- 
fy those games into branching 
families of wins for White, 
wins for Black and draws, and 
the additional time required 
to trace out chains of key- 
moves leading always to wins. 
So the Machine can’t play 
chess like God. What the Ma- 
chine can do is examine all 
the likely lines of play for 
about eight moves ahead — 
that is, four moves each for 
White and Black — and then 
decide which is the best move 
on the basis of capturing en- 
emy pieces, working toward 
checkmate, establishing a pow- 
erful central position and so 
on. 

sounds like the 
A way a man would play 
a game,” Sandra observed. 
‘"Look ahead a little way and 
try to make a plan. You know, 
like getting out trumps in 
bridge or setting up a fi- 
nesse.” 

“Exactly!” Doc beamed at 
her approvingly. “The Ma- 
chine is like a man, A rather 

68 



peculiar and not exactly pleas- 
ant man. A man who always 
abides by sound principles, 
who is utterly incapable of 
flights of genius, but who 
never makes a mistake. You 
see, you are finding human 
interest already, even in the 
Machine.” 

Sandra nodded. “Does a hu- 
man chess player — a grand- 
master, I mean — ever look 
eight moves ahead in a game?” 

“Most assuredly he does! 
In crucial situations, say 
where there’s a chance of win- 
ning at once by trapping the 
enemy king, he examines many 
more moves ahead than that 
— thirty or forty even. The 
Machine is probably pro- 
grammed to recognize such 
situations and do something 
of the same sort, though we 
can’t be sure from the infor- 
mation World Business Ma- 
chines has released. But in 
most chess positions the pos- 
sibilities are so very nearly 
unlimited that even a grand- 
master can only look a very 
few moves ahead and must 
rely on his judgment and ex- 
perience and artistry. The 
equivalent of those in the Ma- 
chine is the directions fed 
into it before it plays a game.” 

“You mean the program- 
ming?” 

“Indeed yes! The program- 
ming is the crux of the prob- 
lem of the chess-playing com- 
puter. The first practical mod- 
el, reported by Bernstein and 
Roberts of IBM in 1958 and 
which looked four moves

ahead, was programmed so 
that it had a greedy worried 
tendency to grab at enemy 
pieces and to retreat its own 
whenever they were attacked. 
It had a personality like that 
of a certain kind of chess- 
playing dub — a dull-brained 
woodpusher afraid to take the 
slightest risk of losing materi- 
al — ^but a dub who could al- 
most always beat an utter nov- 
ice. The^ WBM machine here 
in the hall operates about a 
million times as fast. Don’t 
ask me how, I’m no physicist, 
but it depends on the new 
transistors and something they 
call hypervelocity, which in 
turn depends on keeping parts 
of the Machine at a tempera- 
ture near absolute zero. How- 
ever, the result is that the 
Machine can see eight moves 
ahead and is capable of being 
programmed much more craft- 
ily.” 

'‘A million times as fast as 
the first machine, you say. 
Doc? And yet it only sees 
twice as many moves ahead?” 
Sandra objected. 

“There is a geometrical pro- 
gression involved there,” he 
told her with a smile. “Believe 
me, eight moves ahead is a lot 
of moves when you remember 
that the Machine is errorlessly 
examining every one of thou- 
sands of variations. Flesh-and 
blood chess masters have lost 
games by blunders they could 
have avoided by looking only 
one or two moves ahead. The 
Machine will make no such 
oversights. Once again, you 

THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE 



see, you have the human fac- 
tor, in this case working for 
the Machine.” 

“Savilly, I have been look- 
ing allplace for you!” 

A stocky, bull-faced man 
with a great bristling shock of 
black, gray-flecked hair had 
halted abruptly by their table. 
He bent over Doc and began 
to whisper explosively in a 
guttural foreign tongue. 

S ANDRA’S gaze traveled 
beyond the balustrade. Now 
that she could look down at it, 
the central hall seemed less 
confusedly crowded. In the 
middle, toward the far end, 
were five small tables spaced 
rather widely apart and with a 
chessboard and men and one 
of the Siamese clocks set out 
on each. To either side of the 
hall were tiers of temporary 
seats, about half of them oc- 
cupied. There were at least as 
many more people still wan- 
dering about. 

On the far wall was a big 
electric scoreboard and also, 
above the corresponding ta- 
bles, five large dully glassy 
chessboards, the White 
squares in light gray, the 
Black squares in dark. 

One of the five wall chess- 
boards was considerably larger 
than the other four — the one 
above the Machine. 

Sandra looked with quicken- 
ing interest at the console of 
the Machine — a bank of keys 
and some half-dozen panels of 
rows and rows of tiny telltale 
lights, all dark at the moment. 

69 




A thick red velvet cord on lit- 
tle brass standards ran around 
the Machine at a distance of 
about ten feet. Inside the cord 
were only a few gray- 
smocked men. Two of them 
had just laid a black cable to 
the nearest chess table and 
were attaching it to the Sia- 
mese clock. 

Sandra tried to think of a 
being who always checked 
everything, but only within 
limits beyond which his 
thoughts never ventured, and 
who never made a mistake. 

“Miss Grayling! May I pre- 
sent to you Igor Jandorf.” 

She turned back quickly 
with a smile and a nod. 

‘T should tell you, Igor,” 
Doc continued, “that Miss 
Grayling represents a large 
and influential Midwestern 
newspaper. Perhaps you have 
a message for her readers.” 
The shock-h e a d e d man’s 
eyes flashed. “I most certainly 
do !” At that moment the wait- 
er arrived with a second cof- 
fee and wine-and seltzer. Jan- 
dorf seized Doc’s new demi- 
tasse, drained it, set it back on 
the tray with a flourish and 
drew himself up. 

your readers. Miss 
A Grayling,” he pro- 
claimed, fiercely arching his 
eyebrows at her and actually 
slapping his chest, “that I, 
Igor Jandorf, will defeat the 
Machine by the living force of 
my human personality ! Al- 
ready I have offered to play it 
an informal game blindfold— 



I, who have played 50 blind- 
fold games simultaneously ! 
Its owners refuse me. I have 
challenged it also to a few 
games of rapid-transit — an 
offer no true grandmaster 
would dare ignore. Again they 
refuse me. I predict that the 
Machine will play like a great 
oaf — at least against me. Re- 
peat: I, Igor Jandorf, by the 
living force of my human per- 
sonality, will defeat the Ma- 
chine. Do you have that? You 
can remember it?” 

“Oh yes,” Sandra assured 
him, “but there are some other 
questions I very much want to 
ask you, Mr. Jandorf.” 

“I am sorry. Miss Grayling, 
but I must clear my mind now. 
In ten minutes they start the 
clocks.” 

While Sandra arranged for 
an interview with Jandorf af- 
ter the day’s playing session^ 
Doc reordered his coffee. 

“One expects it of Jandorf,’* 
he explained to Sandra with a 
philosophic shrug when the 
shock-headed man was gone. 
“At least he didn’t take your 
wine-and-seltzer. Or did he? 
One tip I have for you: don’t 
call a chess master Mister, call 
him Master. They all eat it 
up.” 

“Gee, Doc, I don’t know 
how to thank you for every- 
thing. I hope I haven’t offend- 
ed Mis — Master Jandorf so 

that he doesn’t — ” 

-»> 

“Don’t worry about that. 
Wild horses couldn’t keep 
Jandorf away from a press 
interview. You know, his

rapid-transit challenge was 
cunning. That’s a minor varie- 
ty of chess where each player 
gets only ten seconds to make 
a move. Which I don’t -sup- 
pose would give the Machine 
time to look three moves 
ahead. Chess players would 
say that the Machine has a 
very slow sight of the board. 
This tournament is being 
played at the usual interna- 
tional rate of 15 moves an 
hour, and — ” 

‘Ts that why they’ve got all 
those crazy clocks?” Sandra 
interrupted. 

“Oh, yes. Chess clocks meas- 
ure the time each player 
takes in making his moves. 
When a player makes a move 
he presses a button that shuts 
his clock off and turns his op- 
ponent’s on. If a player uses 
too much time, he loses as 
surely as if he were checkmat- 
ed. Now since the Machine 
will almost certainly be pro- 
grammed to take an equal 
amount of time on successive 
moves, a rate of 15 moves an 
hour means it will have 4 min- 
utes a move — and it will need 
every second of them ! Inci- 
dentally it was typical Jan- 
dorf bravado to make a point 
of a blindfold challenge — just 
as if the Machine weren’t play- 
ing blindfold itself. Or is the 
Machine blindfold? How do 
you think of it?” 

“Gosh , I don’t know. Say, 
Doc, is it really true that Mas- 
ter Jandorf has played 50 
games at once blindfolded? I 
can’t believe that.’' 



course not!” Doc as- 
sured her. “It was only 
49 and he lost two of those 
and drew five. Jandorf always 
exaggerates. It’s in his blood.” 

“He’s one of the Russians, 
isn’t he ?” Sandra asked. 
“Igor?” 

Doc chuckled. “Not exact- 
ly,” he said gently. “He is 
originally a Pole and now he 
has Argentinian citizenship. 
You have a program, don’t 
you?” 

Sandra started to hunt 
through her pocketbook, but 
just then two lists of names 
lit up on the big electric 
scoreboard.

“Gripes, Doc, they all sound 
like they were Russians,” San- 
dra said after a bit. “Except 
this Willie Angler. Oh, he’s

I 

the boy wonder, isn’t he?’' 

Doc nodded. ‘‘Not such a 
boy any longer, though. He’s 
. Well, speak of the Devil’s 
children... Miss Grayling, I 
have the honor of presenting 
to you the only grandmaster 
ever to have been ex-chess- 
champion of the United States 
while still technically a mi- 
nor — Master William Augus- 
tus Angler.” 

A tall, sharply-dressed 
young man with a hatchet face 
pressed the old man back into 
his chair. 

‘‘How are you. Savvy, old 
boy old boy?” he demanded. 
“Still chasing the girls, I see.” 
“Please, Willie, get off me.” 
“Can’t take it, huh?” Angler 
straightened up somewhat. 
“Hey waiter ! Where’s that 
chocolate malt? I don’t want 
it next year. About that ex-, 
though. I was swindled. Sav- 
vy. I was robbed.” 

“Willie!” Doc said with 
some asperity. “Miss Grayling 
is a journalist. She would like 
to have a statement from you 
as to how you will play 
against the Machine.” 

A ngler grinned and 
shook his head sadly. 
“Poor old Machine,” he said. 
“I don’t know why they take 
so much trouble polishing up 
that pile of tin just so that I 
can give it a hit in the head. I 
got a hatful of moves it’ll burn 
out all its tubes trying to an- 
swer. And if it gets too fresh, 
how about you and me giving

the hotfoot. Savvy? The mon- 
ey WBM’s putting up is okay, 
though. That first prize will 
just fit the big hole in my 
bank account.” 

“I know you haven’t the 
time now. Master Angler,” 
Sandra said rapidly, “but if 
after the playing session you 
could grant me — ” 

“Sorry, babe,” Angler broke 
in with a wave of dismissal. 
“I’m dated up ft>r two months 
in advance. Waiter! I’m here, 
not there !” And he went 
charging off. 

Doc and Sandra looked at 
each other and smiled. 

“Chess masters aren’t exact- 
ly humble people, are they?” 
she said. 

Doc’s smile became tinged 
with sad understanding. “You 
must excuse them, though,” he 
said. “They really get so lit- 
tle recognition or recompense. 
This tournament is an excep- 
tion. And it takes a great deal 
of ego to play greatly.” 

“I suppose so. So World 
Business Machines is respon- 
sible for this tournament?” 
“Correct. Their advertising 
department is interested in 
the pfestige. They want to 
score a point over their great 
rival.” 

“But if the Machine plays 
badly it will be a black eye 
for them,” Sandra pointed out. 

“True,” Doc agreed thought- 
fully. “WBM must feel very 
sure. It’s the prize money 
they’ve put up, of course, 
that’s brought the world’s 
greatest players here. Other- 



73 




wise half of them would be 
holding off in the best tem- 
peramental-artist style. For 
chess players the prize money 
is fabulous — ^$35,000, with 
$15,000 for first place, and all 
expenses paid for all players. 
There’s never been anything 
like it. Soviet Russia is the 
only country that has ever 
supported and rewarded her 
best chess players at all ade- 
quately. I think the Russian 
players are here because UN- 
ESCO and FIDE (that’s Fed- 
eration Internationale d e s 
E c h e c s — the international 
chess organization) are also 
backing the tournament. And 
perhaps because the Kremlin 
is hungry for a little prestige 
now that its space program is 
sagging.” 

‘‘But if a Russian doesn’t 
take first place it will be a 
black eye for them.” 

Doc frowned. ‘‘True, in a 
sense. They must feel very 
sure... Here they are now.” 

F our men were crossing 
the center of the hall, which 
was clearing, toward the tables 
at the other end. Doubtless 
they just happened to be go- 
ing two by two in close for- 
mation, but it gave Sandra the 
feeling of a phalanx. 

“The first two are Lysmov 
and Votbinnik,” Doc told her. 
“It isn’t often that you see 
the current champion of the 
world — Votbinnik — and an ex- 
champion arm in arm. There 
are two other persons in the 
tournament who have held that 



honor — Jal and Vanderhoef 
the director, way back.” 

“Will whoever wins this 
tournament become cham- 
pion?” 

“Oh no. That’s decided by 
two-player matches — a very 
long business — after elimina- 
tion tournaments between 
leading contenders. This tour- 
nament is a round robin : each 
player plays one game with 
every other player. That 
means nine rounds.” 

“Anyway there are an awful 
lot of Russians in the tourna- 
ment,” Sandra said, consulting 
her program. “Four out of ten 
have USSR after them. And 
Bela Grabo, Hungary — that’s 
a satellite. And Sherevsky and 
Krakatower are Russian- 
sounding names.” 

“The proportion of Soviet 
to American entries in the 
tourneiment represents pretty 
fairly the general difference 
in playing strength between 
the two countries,” Doc said 
judiciously. “Chess mastery 
moves from land to land with 
the years. Way back it was 
the Moslems and the Hindus 
and Persians. Then Italy and 
Spain. A little over a hundred 
years ago it was France and 
England. Then Germany, Aus- 
tria and the New World. Now 
it’s R u s s i a- — including of 
course the Russians who have 
run away from Russia, But 
don’t think there aren’t a lot 
of good Anglo-Saxon types 
who are masters of the first 
water. In fact, there are a lot 
of them here around us.

though perhaps you don’t 
think so. It’s just that if you 
play a lot of chess you get to 
looking Russian. Once it prob- 
ably made you look Italian. 
Do you see that short bald- 
headed man?” 

“You mean the one facing 
the Machine and talking to 
Jandorf ?” 

“Yes. Now that’s one with a 
lot of human interest. Moses 
Sherevsky. Been champion of 
the United States many times. 
A very strict Orthodox Jew. 
Can’t play chess on Fridays 
or on Saturdays before sun- 
down.” He chuckled. “Why, 
there’s even a storv going 
around that one rabbi told 
Sherevsky it would be unlaw- 
ful for him to play against 
the Machine because it is tech- 
n i c a 1 1 y a golem — the clay 
Frankenstein’s monster of He- 
brew legend.” 

Sandra asked, “What about 
Grabo and Kratower?” 

D OC gave a short scornful 
laugh. “Krakatower! Don’t 
pay any attention to him. A 
senile has-been, it’s a scandal 
he’s been allowed to play in 
this tournament ! He must 
have pulled all sorts of 
strings. Told them that his 
lifelong services to chess had 
won him the honor and that 
they had to have a member of 
the so-called Old Guard. 
Maybe he even got down on 
his knees and cried — and all 
the time his eyes on that ex- 
pense money and the last* 
place consolation prize! Yet 

TM€ .e4-6ai#ARC MADHOU8C 



dreaming schizophrenically of 
beating them all ! Please, don’t 
get me started on Dirty Old 
Krakatower.” 

“Take it easy. Doc. He 
sounds like he would make 
an interesting article. ' Can 
you point him out to me?” 

“You can tell hirrl bv his 
long white beard with coffee 
stains. I don’t see it any- 
where, though. Perhaps he’s 
shaved it off for the occa- 
sion. It would be like that 
antique womanizer to develop 
senile delusions of youthful- 
ness.” 

“And Grabo?” Sandra 
pressed, suppressing a smile 
at the intensity of Doc’s ani- 
mosity. 

Doc’s eyes grew thoughtful. 
“About Bela Grabo (why are 
three out of four Hungarians 
named Bela?) I will tell you 
only this: That he is a very 
brilliant player and that the 
Machine is very lucky to have 
drawn him as its first oppo- 
nent.” 

He would not amplify his 
statement. Sandra studied the 
scoreboard again. 

“This Simon Great who’s 
down as programming the 
Machine. He’s a famous physi- 
cist, I suppose?” 

“By no means. That was the 
trouble with some of the early 
chess-playing machines — they 
were programmed by scien- 
tists. No, Simon Great is a 
psychologist who at one time 
was a leading contender for 
the world’s chess champion- 
ship. I think WBM was sur- 

75 




prisingly shrewd to pick him 
for the programming job. Let 
me tell you — No, better 
yet — ’’ 

Doc shot to his feet, 
stretched an arm on high and 
called out sharply, ‘'Simon !” 
A man some four tables 
away waved back and a mo- 
ment later came over. 

“What is it, Savilly?” he 
asked. “There’s hardly any 
time, you know.” 

T he newcomer was of mid- 
dle height, compact of 
figure and feature, with gray- 
ing hair cut short and combed 
sharply back. 

Doc spoke his piece for 
Sandra. 

Simon Great smiled thinly. 
“Sorry,” he said, “But I am 
making no predictions and we 
are giving out no advance in- 
formation on the program- 
ming of the Machine. As you 
know, I have had to fight the 
Players’ Committee tooth and 
nail on all sorts of points 
about that and they have won 
most of them. I am not per- 
mitted to re-program the Ma- 
chine at adjournments— only 
between games (I did insist 
on that and get it!) And if 
the Machine breaks down dur- 
ing a game, its clock keeps 
running on it. My men are 
permitted to make repairs — if 
they can work fast enough.” 
“That makes it very tough 
Oil you,” Sandra put in. “The 
Machine isn’t allowed any 
weaknesses.” 

Great nodded soberly. “And 

76 



now I must go. They’ve al- 
most finished the count-down, 
as one of my technicians keeps 
on calling it. Very pleased to 
have met. you. Miss Grayling 
— I’ll check with our PR man 
on that interview. Be seeing 
you. Savvy.” 

The tiers of seats were 
filled now and the central 
space almost clear. Officials 
were shooing off a few knots 
of lingerers. Several of the 
grandmasters, including all 
four Russians, were seated at 
their tables. Press and com- 
pany cameras were flashing. 
The four smaller wallboards 
lit Up with the pieces in the 
opening position — ^white for 
White and red for Black. 
Simon Great stepped over the 
red velvet cord and more flash 
bulbs went off. 

“You know. Doc,” Sandra 
said, “I’m a dog to suggest 
this, but what if this whole 
thing were a big fake? What 
if Simon Great were really 
playing the Machine’s moves? 
There would surely be some 
way for his electricians to 
rig—” 

Doc laughed happily — and 
so loudly that some people at 
the adjoining tables frowned. 

“Miss Grayling, that is a 
wonderful idea! I will prob- 
ably steal it for a short story. 
I still manage to write and 
place a few in England. No, I 
do not think that is at all like- 
ly. WBM would never risk 
such a fraud. Great is ccwn- 
pletely out of practice for ac- 
tual tournament play, though 

by FRiTZ LEIBER 




not for chess-thinking. The 
difference in style between 
a computer and a man would 
be evident to any expert. 
Great’s own style is remem- 
bered and would be recog- 
nized — though, come to think 
of it, his style was often de- 
scribed as being machine- 
like...” For a moment Doc’s 
eyes became thoughtful. Then 
he smiled again. ”But no, the 
idea is impossible. Vanderhoef 
as Tournament Director has 
played two or three games 
with the Machine to assure 
himself that it operates legiti- 
mately ,and has grandmaster 
skill.” 

‘‘Did the Machine beat 
him?” Sandra asked. 

D OC shrugged. “The scores 
weren’t released. It was 
very hush-hush. But about 
your idea. Miss Grayling — 
did you ever read about Mael- 
zel’s famous chessplaying au- 
tomaton of the 19th Century? 
That one too was supposed to 
work by machinery (cogs and 
gears, not electricity) but ac- 
tually it had a man hidden in- 
side it — your Edgar Poe ex- 
posed the fraud in a famous 
article. In my story I think 
the chess robot will break 
down while it is being dem- 
onstrated to a millionaire pur- 
chaser and the young in- 
ventor will have to win its 
game for it to cover up and 
swing the deal. Only the mil- 
lionaire’s daughter, who is 
really a better player than ei- 
ther of them... yes, yes! Your 



'•Ambrose Bierce too wrote a 
story about a chessplaying 
robot of the clickety-clank- 
grr kind who murdered his 
creator, crushing him like an 
iron grizzly bear when the 
man won a game from him. 
Tell me. Miss Grayling, do 
you find yourself imagining 
this Machine putting out an- 
gry tendrils to strangle its 
opponents, or beaming rays of 
death and hypnotism at them? 
I can imagine...” 

While Doc chattered hap- 
pily on about chessplaying 
robots and chess stories, San- 
dra found herself thinking 
about him. A writer of some 
sort evidently and a terrific 
chess buff. Perhaps he was* 
an actual medical doctor. 
She’d read something about 
two or three coming over with 
the Russian squad. But Doc 
certainly didn’t sound like a 
Soviet citizen. 

He was older than she’d 
first assumed. She could see 
that now that she was listen- 
ing to him less and looking 
at him more. Tired, too. Only 
his dark-circled eyes shone 
with unquenchable youth. A 
useful old guy, whoever he 
was. An hour ago she’d been 
sure she was going to muff 
this assignment completely 
and now she had it laid out 
cold. For the umpteenth time 
in her career Sandra shied 
away from the guilty thought 
that she wasn’t a writer at all 
or even a reporter, she just 
used dime-a-dozen female at- 
tractiveness to rope a sus-

ceptible man (young, old, 
American, Russian) and pick 
his brain. •• 

She realized suddenly that 
the whole hall had become 
very quiet. 

Doc was the only person 
still talking and people were 
again looking at them disap- 
provingly. All five wall-boards 
were lit up and the changed 
position of a few pieces 
showed that opening moves 
had been made on four of 
them, including the Ma- 
chine's. The central space be- 
tween the tiers of seats was 
completely clear now, except 
for one man hurrying across 
it in their direction with the 
rapid yet quiet, almost tip-toe 
walk that seemed to mark all 
the officials. Like mortician^ 
assistants, she thought. He 
rapidly ^mounted the stairs 
and halted at the top to look 
around searchingly. His gaze 
lighted on their table, his eye- 
brows went up, and he made 
a beeline for Doc. Sandra 
wondered if she should warn 
him that he was about to be 
shushed. 

The official laid a hand on 
Doc's shoulder. ‘‘Sir!" he said 
agitatedly. “Do you realize 
that they've started your 
clock. Dr. Krakatower?" 

S ANDRA became aware that 
Doc was grinning at her. 
“Yes, it’s true enough. Miss 
Grayling," he said. “I trust 
you will pardon the deception, 
though it was hardly one, 
even technically. Every word 



I told you about Dirty Old 
Krakatower is literally true. 
Except the long white beard 
— he never wore a beard after 
he was 35 — that part was an 
out-and-out lie! Yes, yes! I 
will be along in a moment ! Do 
not worry, the spectators will 
get their money's worth out 
of me ! And WBM did not 
with its expense account buy 
my soul — that belongs to the 
young lady here." 

Doc rose, lifted her hand 
and kissed it. “Thank you, 
mademoiselle, for a charming 
interlude. I hope it will be re- 
peated. Incidentally, I should 
say that besides. (Stop pull- 
ing at me, man! — there can't 
be five minutes on my clock 
yet !) . that besides being 
Dirty Old Krakatower, grand- 
master emeritus, I am also the 
special correspondent of the 
London Times. It is always 
pleasant to chat with a col- 
league. Please do not hesitate 
to use in your articles any of 
the ideas I tossed out, if you 
find them worthy — I sent in 
my own first dispatch two 
hours ago. Yes, yes, I come! 
Au revoir, mademoiselle!" 

He was at the bottom of the 
stairs when Sandra jumped up 
and hurried to the balustrade. 

“Hey, Doc!" she called. 

He turned. 

“Good luck !" she shouted 
and waved. 

He kissed his hand to her 
and went on. 

People glared at her then 
and a horrified official came 
hurrying. Sandra made big

frightened eyes at him, but 
she couldn't quite hide her 
grin. 

IV 

S ITZFLEISCH (which 
roughly means endurance 
— “sitting flesh" or “buttock 
meat") is the quality needed 
above all others by tournament 
chess players — and their audi- 
ences. 

After Sandra had watched 
the games (the players’ faces, 
rather — she had a really good 
pair of zoomer glasses) for a 
half hour or so, she had gone 
to her hotel room, written her 
first article (interview with 
the famous Dr. Krakatower), 
sent it in and then come back 
to the hall to see how the 
games had turned out. 

They were still going on, 
all five of them. 

The press section was full, 
but two boys and a girl of 
high-school age obligingly 
made room for Sandra on the 
top tier of seats and she 
tuned in on their whispered 
conversation. The jargon was 
recognizably related to that 
which she’d gotten a dose of 
on the floor, but gamier. Play- 
ers did not sacrifice pawns, 
they sacked them. No one was 
ever defeated, only busted. 
Pieces weren’t lost but blown. 
The Ruy Lopez was the Dirty 
Old Roodcy — and incidentally 
a certain set of opening moves 
named after a long-departed 
Spanish churchman, she now 
discovered from I^vc, Bill 

THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE 



and Judy, whose sympathetic 
help she won by frequent 
loans of her zoomer glasses. 

The four-hour time control 
point-^two hours and 30 
moves for each player — had 
been passed while she was 
sending in her article, she 
learned, and they were well on 
their way toward the next 
control point — an hour more 
and 15 moves for each player 
— after which unfinished 
games would be adjourned and 
continued at a special morning 
session. Sherevsky had had to 
make 15 moves in two min- 
utes after taking an hour 
earlier on just one move. But 
that was nothing out of the 
ordinary, Dave had assured 
her in the same breath, 
Sherevsky was always letting 
himself get into “fantastic 
time-pressure" and then wrig- 
gling out of it brilliantly. He 
was apparently headed for a 
win over Serek. Score one for 
the USA over the USSR, 
Sandra thought proudly. 

Votbinnik had Jandorf prac- 
tically in Zugzwang (his 
pieces all tied up. Bill Ex- 
plained) and the Argentinian 
would be busted shortly. 
Through the glasses Sandra 
could see Jandorf’s thick 
chest rise and fall as he glared 
murderously at the board in 
front of him. By contrast Vot- 
binnik looked like a man lost 
in reverie. 

Dr. Krakatower had lost a 
pawn to Lysmov but was 
hanging on grimly. However, 
Dave would not give a 

79 




plugged nickle for his chanqes 
against the former world’s 
champion, because ‘‘those old 
ones always weaken in the 
sixth hour.” 

“You for-get the bio-logical 
mir-acle of Doc-tor Las-ker,” 
Bill and Judy chanted as one. 

“Shut up,” Dave warned 
them. An official glared an- 
grily from the floor and shook 
a finger. Much later Sandra 
discovered that Dr. Emanuel 
Lasker was a philosopher- 
mathematician who, after 
holding the world’s champion- 
ship for 26 years, had won a 
very strong tournament (New 
York 1924) at the age of 56 
and later almost won another 
(Moscow 1935) at the age of 
67. 

S ANDRA studied Doc’s face 
carefully through her 
glasses. He looked terribly 
tired now, almost a death’s 
head. Something tightened in 
her chest and she looked away 
quickly. 

The Angler-Jal and Grabo- 
Machine games were still 
ding-dong contests, Dave told 
her. If anything, Grabo had a 
slight advantage. The Ma- 
chine was “on the move,” 
meaning that Grabo had just 
made a move and was waiting 
the automaton’s reply. 

The Hungarian was about 
the most restless “waiter” 
Sandra could imagine. He 
twisted his long legs constant- 
ly and writhed his shoulders 
and about every five seconds 
he ran his hands back through 



his unkempt tassle of hair. 

Once he yawned selfcon- 
sciously, straightened himself 
and sat very compactly. But 
almost immediately he was 
writhing again. 

The Machine had its own 
mannerisms, if you could call 
them that. Its dim, unobtru- 
sive telltale lights were wink- 
ing on and off in a fairly rap- 
id, random pattern. Sandra got 
the impression that from time 
to time Grabo’s eyes were try- 
ing to follow their blinking, 
like a man watching fireflies. 

Simon Great sat impassive- 
ly behind a bare table next to 
the Machine, his five gray- 
smocked technicians grouped 
around him. 

A flushed-faced, tall, distin- 
guished-looking elderly gen- 
tleman was standing by the 
Machine’s console. Dave told 
Sandra it was Dr. Vanderhoef, 
the Tournament Director, 
one-time champion of the 
world. 

“Another old potzer like 
Krakatower, but with sense 
enough to know when he’s 
licked,” Bill characterized 
harshly. 

“Youth, ah, un-van-quish- 
able youth,” Judy chanted 
happily by herself. “Flashing 
like a meteor across the chess 
fir-ma-ment. Morphy, Angler, 
Judy Kaplan. .” 

“Shut up! They really will 
throw us out,” Dave warned 
her and then explained in 
whispers to Sandra that Van- 
derhoef and his assistants had 
the nervous-making job of 



80 



by FRITZ LEIBCR 




feeding into the Machine the 
moves made by its opponent, 
*'so everyone vsrill know it's on 
the level, I guess." He added, 
“It means the Machine loses 
a few seconds every move, be- 
tween the time Grabo punch- 
es the clock and the time Van- 
derhoef gets the move fed into 
the Machine." 

Sandra nodded. The players 
were making it as hard on the 
Machine as possible, she de- 
cided with a small rush of 
sympathy. 

S UDDENLY there was a 
tiny movement of the 
gadget attached from the Ma- 
chine to the clocks on Grabo’s 
table and a faint click. But 
Grabo almost leapt out of his 
skin. 

Simultaneously a red castle- 
topped piece (one of the Ma- 
chine’s rooks, Sandra was in- 
formed) moved four squares 
sideways on the big electric 
board above the Machine. An 
official beside Dr. Vanderhoef 
went Qver to Grabo’s board 
and carefully moved the cor- 
responding piece. Grabo 
seemed about to make some 
complaint, then apparently 
thought better of it and 
plunged into brooding cogita- 
tion over the board, elbows on 
the table, both hands holding 
his head and fiercely massag- 
ing his scalp. 

The Machine let loose with 
an unusually rapid flurry of 
blinking. Grabo straightened 
up, seemed again about to 
make a complaint, then once 

tHC iS4-SQUARE MADHOUSE 



more to repress the impulse. 
Finally he moved a piece and 
punched his clock. Dr. Van- 
derhoef irtimediately flipped 
four levers on the Machine's 
console and Grabo's move ap- 
peared on the electric board. 

Grabo sprang up, went over 
to the red velvet cord and mo- 
tioned agitatedly to Vander- 
hoef. 

There was a short confer- 
ence, inaudible at the distance, 
during which Grabo waved his 
arms and Vanderhoef grew 
more flushed. Finally the lat- 
ter went over to Simon Great 
and said something, apparent- 
ly with some hesitancy. But 
Great smiled obligingly, 
sprang to his feet, and in turn 
spoke to his technicians, who 
immediately fetched and un- 
folded several large screens 
and set them in front of the 
Machine, masking the blink- 
lights. Blindfolding it, 
Sandra found herself think- 
ing. 

Dave chuckled. “That’s al- 
ready happened once while 
you were out," he told San- 
dra. “I guess seeing the lights 
blinking makes Grabo nerv- 
ous. But then not seeing them 
makes him nervous. Just 
watch." 

“The Machine has its own 
mysterious pow-wow-wers," 
Judy chanted. 

“That’s what you think," 
Bill told her. “Did you know 
that Willie Angler has hired 
Evil Eye Bixel out of Brook- 
lyn to put the whammy on 
the Machine? S’fact." 



81 




. pow-wow-wers unknown 
to mere mortals of flesh and 
blood—” 

‘‘Shut up!” Dave hissed. 
‘‘Now youVe done it. Here 
comes old Eagle Eye. Look, I 
don’t know you two. I’m with 
this lady here.” 

B ela Grabo was suffering 
acute tortures. He had a 
winning attack, he knew it. 
The Machine was counter- 
attacking, but unstrategically, 
desperately, in the style of 
a Frank Marshall complicat- 
ing the issue and hoping for 
a swindle. All Grabo had to 
do, he knew, was keep his 
head and not blunder — not 
throw away a queen, say, as 
he had to old Vanderhoef at 
Brussels, or overlook a mate 
in two, as he had against 
Sherevsky at Tel Aviv. The 
memory of those unutterably 
black moments and a dozen 
more like them returned to 
haunt him. Never if he lived 
a thousand years would he be 
free of them. 

For the tenth time in the 
last two minutes he glanced 
at his clock. He had fifteen 
minutes in which to make five 
moves. He wasn’t in time- 
pressure, he must remember 
that. He mustn’t make a move 
on impulse, he mustn’t let his 
treacherous hand leap out 
without waiting for instruc- 
tions from its guiding brain. 

First prize in this tourna- 
ment meant incredible wealth 
— transportation money and 
hotel bills for more than a 

Q2 



score of future tournaments. 
But more than that, it was one 
more chance to blazon before 
the world his true superiority 
rather than the fading reputa- 
tion of it. ”... Bela Grabo, 
brilliant but erratic...” Per- 
haps his last chance. 

When, in the name of Heav- 
en, was the Machine going to 
make its next move? Surely it 
had already taken more than 
four minutes! But a glance at 
its clock showed him that 
hardly half that time had gone 
by. He decided he had made 
a mistake in asking again for 
the screens. It was easier to 
watch those damned lights 
blink than have them blink 
in his imagination. 

Oh, if chess could only be 
played in intergalactic space, 
in the black privacy of one’s 
thoughts. But there had to be 
the physical presence of the 
opponent with his (possibly 
deliberate) unnerving manner- 
isms — Lasker and his cigar, 
Capablanca and his red neck- 
tie, Nimzowitsch and his nerv- 
ous contortions (very like 
Bela Grabo’s, though the lat- 
ter did not see it that way). 
And now this ghastly flash- 
ing, humming, stinking, but- 
ton-banging metal monster ! 

Actually, he told himself, he 
was being asked to play two 
opponents, the Machine and 
Simon Great, a sort of con- 
sultation team. It wasn’t fair! 

T he Machine hammered its 
button and rammed its 
queen across the electric 

by FRITZ LEIBER 




board. In Grabo^s imagination 
it was like an explosion. , 

Grabo held onto his nerves 
with an effort and plunged 
into a maze of calculations. 

Once he came to, like a man 
who has been asleep, to realize 
that he was wondering wheth- 
er the lights were still blink- 
ing behind the screens while 
he was making his move. Did 
the Machine really analyze at 
such times or were the lights 
just an empty trick? He 
forced his mind back to the 
problems of the game, decided 
on his move, checked the 
board twice for any violent 
move he might have missed, 
noted on his clock that he’d 
taken five minutes, checked 
the board again very rapidly 
and then put out his hand and 
made his move — with the 
fiercely suspicious air of a 
boss compelled to send an ex- 
tremely unreliable underling 
on an all-important errand. 

Then he punched his clock, 
sprang to his feet, and once 
more waved for Vanderhoef. 

Thirty seconds later the 
Tournament Director, very 
red-faced now, was saying in 
a low voice, almost pleadingly, 
‘‘But Bela, I cannot keep ask- 
ing them to change the 
screens. Already they have 
been up twice and down once 
to please you. Moving them 
disturbs the other players and 
surely isn’t good for your own 
peace of mind. Oh, Bela, my 
dear Bela — ” 

Vanderhoef broke off. 
Grabo knew he had been go- 

THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE 



ing to say something improper 
but from the heart, such as, 
“For God’s sake don’t blow 
this game out of nervousness 
now that you have a win in 
sight” — a n d this sympathy 
somehow made the Hungarian 
furious. 

“I have other complaints 
which I will make formally 
after the game,” he said harsh- 
ly, quivering with rage. “It is 
a disgrace the way that 
mechanism punches the time- 
clock button. It will crack the 
case ! The Machine never 
stops humming! And it stinks 
of ozone and hot metal, as if 
it were about to explode !” 

“It cannot explode, Bela. 
Please !” 

“No, but it threatens to! 
And you know a threat is al- 
ways more effective than an 
actual attack! As for the 
screens, they must be taken 
down at once, I demand it!” 

“Very well, Bela, very well, 
it will be done. Compose your- 
self.” 

Grabo did not at once re- 
turn to his table — he could 
not have endured to sit still 
for the moment — but paced 
along the line of tables, 
snatching looks at the other 
games in progress. When he 
looked back at the big electric 
board, he saw that the Ma- 
chine had made a move al- 
though he hadn’t heard it 
punch the clock. He rushed 
back and studied the board 
without sitting down. Why, 
the Machine had made a 
stupid move, he saw with a 

83 




rush of exaltation. At that mo- 
ment the last screen being 
folded started to fall over, but 
one of the gray-smocked men 
caught it deftly. G r a b o 
flinched and his hand darted 
out and moved a piece. 

He heard someone grasp. 
Vanderhoef. 

TT got very quiet. The four 
•^soft clicks of the move be- 
ing fed into the Machine were 
like the beat of a muffled 
driTm. 

There was a buzzing in 
Grabo’s ears. He looked down 
a': the board in horror. 

The Machine blinked, 
blinked once more and then, 
although barely twenty sec- 
onds had elapsed, moved a 
rook. 

On the glassy gray margin 
above the Machine’s electric 
board, large red words flamed 
on : 

CHECK! AND MATE IN 
THREE 

Up in the stands Dave 
squee5:ed Sandra’s arm. ‘‘He’s 
done it! He’s let himself be 
swindled.” 

“You mean the Machine has 
beaten Grabo?” Sandra asked. 

“What else?” 

“Can you be sure? Just like 
that?” 

“Of cour... Wait a sec- 
ond. Yes, I’m sure.” 

“Mated in three like a pot- 
zer,” Bill confirmed. 

' “The poor old boob,” Judy 
sighed. 

84 



Down on the floor Bela 
Grabo sagged. The assistant 
director moved toward him 
quickly. But then the Hungar- 
ian straightened himself a lit- 
tle. 

“I resign,” he said softly. 

The red words at the top of 
the board were wiped out and 
briefly replaced, in white, by: 

THANK YOU FOR A 
GOOD GAME 

And then a third statement, 
also in white, flashed on for a 
few seconds : 

YOU HAD BAD LUCK 

Bela Grabo clenched his 
fists and bit his teeth. Even 
the Machine was being sorry 
for him! 

He stiffly walked out of the 
hall. It was a long, long walk. 

V 

ADJOURNMENT time 
neared. Serek, the ex- 
change down but with consid- 
erable time on his clock, 
sealed his forty-sixth move 
against Sherevsky and handed 
the envelope to Vanderhoef. 
It would be opened when the 
game was resumed at the 
morning session. Dr. Kraka- 
tower studied the position on 
his board and then quietly 
tipped over his king. He sat 
there for a moment as if he 
hadn’t the strength to rise. 
Then he shook himself a lit- 
tle, smiled, got up, clasped

hands briefly with Lysmov 
and wandered over to watch 
the Angler- Jal game. 

Jandorf had resigned his 
game to Votbinnik some min- 
utes ago, rather more surlily. 

After a while Angler sealed 
a move, handing it to Vander- 
hoef with a grin just as the 
little red flag dropped on his 
clock, indicating he’d used 
every second of his time. 

Up in the stands Sandra 
worked her shoulders to get a 
kink out of her back. She’d 
noticed several newsmen hur- 
rying off to report in the Ma- 
chine’s first win. She was 
thankful that her job was 
limited to special articles. 

‘‘Chess is a pretty intense 
game,” she remarked to Dave. 

He nodded. “It’s a killer. I 
don’t expect to live beyond 
forty myself.” 

“Thirty,” Bill said. 

“Twenty-five is enough 
time to be a meteor,’' said 
Judy. 

Sandra thought to herself: 
the Unbeat Generation. 

N ext day Sherevsky 
played the Machine to a 
dead-level ending. Simon 
Great offered a draw for the 
Machine (over an unsuccess- 
ful interfering protest from 
Jandorf that this constituted 
making a move for the Ma- 
chine) but Sherevsky refused 
and sealed his move. 

“He wants to have it proved 
to him that the Machine can 
play end games,” Dave com- 
mented to Sandra up in the 

THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE 



stands. “I don’t blame him.** 
At the beginning of today’s 
session Sandra had noticed 
that Bill and Judy were fol- 
lowing each game in a very 
new-looking 1::^ok they shared 
jealously between them. 
Won^t look new for long, 
Sandra had thought. 

“That’s the ‘Bible’ they got 
there,” Dave had explained. 
“MCO — Modern Chess Open- 
ings. It lists all the best open- 
moves in chess, thousands and 
thousands of variations. That 
is, what masters think are the 
best moves. The moves that 
have won in the past, really. 
We chipped in together to 
buy the latest edition — the 
13th — just hot off the press,” 
he had finished proudly. 

Now with the Machine- 
Sherevsky ending the center 
of interest, the kids were con- 
sulting another book, one with 
grimy, dog-eared pages. ^ 
“That’s the ‘New Testa- 
ment’ — Basic Chess End- 
ings"* Dave said when he no- 
ticed her looking. “There’s so 
much you must know in end- 
ings that it’s amazing the Ma- 
chine can play them at all. I 
guess as the pieces get fewer 
it starts to look deeper.” 

S ANDRA nodded. She was 
feeling virtuous. She had 
got her interview with Jan- 
dorf and then this morning 
one with Grabo (“How it 
Feels to Have a Machine Out- 
Think You”). The latter had 
made her think of herself as a 
real vulture of the press, cir- 

as 




cling over the doomed. The 
Hungarian had seemed in a 
positively suicidal depression. 

One newspaper article made 
much of the Machine’s “psy- 
chological tactics,” hinting 
that the blinking lights were 
designed to hypnotize oppo- 
nents. The general press cov- 
erage V73.S somewhat startling. 
A game that in America nor- 
mally rated only a fine-print 
column in the back sections of 
a very few Sunday papers was 
now getting boxes on the 
front page. The defeat of a 
man by a machine seemed 
everywhere to awaken nervous 
feelings of insecurity, like the 
launching of the first sputnik. 

Sandra had rather hesitant- 
ly sought out Dr. Krakatower 
during the close of the morn- 
ing session of play, still feel- 
ing a little guilty from her in- 
terview with Grabo. But Doc 
iiad seemed happy to see her 
and quite recovered from last 
night’s defeat, though when 
she had addressed him as 
“Master Krakatower” he had 
winced and said, “Please, not 
that!” Another session of cof- 
fee and wine-and-seltzer had 
resulted in her getting an in- 
troduction to her first Soviet 
grandmaster, Serek, who had 
proved to be unexpectedly 
charming. He had just man- 
aged to draw his game with 
Sherevsky (to the great 
amazement of the kibitzers, 
Sandra learned) and was most 
obliging about arranging for 
an interview. 

Not to be outdone in gal- 

86 



lantry, Doc had insisted on es- 
corting Sandra to her seat in 
the stands — at the price of 
once more losing a couple of 
minutes on his clock. As a re- 
sult her stock went up consid- 
erably with Dave, Bill and 
Judy. Thereafter they treated 
anything she had to say with 
almost annoying deference — 
Bill especially, probably in 
penance for his thoughtless 
cracks at Doc. Sandra later 
came to suspect that the kids 
had privately decided that she 
was Dr. Krakatower’s mis- 
tress — probably a new one be- 
cause she was so scandalously 
ignorant of chess. She did not 
disillusion them. 

Doc lost again in the second 
round — to Jal. 

I N the third round Lysmov 
defeated the Machine in 27 
moves. There was a flaring of 
flashbulbs, a rush of newsmen 
to the phones, jabbering in the 
stands and much comment and 
analysis that was way over 
Sandra’s head — except she got 
the impression that Lysmov 
had done something tricky. 

The general emotional reac- 
tion in America, as reflected 
by the newspapers, was not 
too happy. One read between 
the lines that for the Machine 
to beat a man was bad, but for 
a Russian to beat an American 
machine was worse. A widely- 
read sports columnist, two 
football coaches, and several 
rural politicians announced 
that chess was a morbid game 
played only by weirdies. De- 

by FRITZ LEIBER 




spite these thick-chested he- 
man statements, the elusive 
mood of insecurity deepened. 

Besides the excitement of 
the Lysmov win, a squabble 
had arisen in connection with 
the Machine’s still-unfinished 
end game with Sherevsky, 
which had been continued 
through one morning session 
and was now headed for an- 
other. 

Finally there were rumors 
that World Business Ma- 
chines was planning to re- 
place Simon Great with a na- 
tionally famous physicist. 

Sandra begged Doc to try to 
explain it all to her in kinder- 
garten language. She was feel- 
ing uncertain of herself again 
and quite subdued after being 
completely rebuffed in her ef- 
forts to get an interview with 
Lysmov, who had fled her as 
if she were a threat to his So- 
viet virtue. 

Doc on the other hand was 
quite vivacious, cheered by his 
third-round draw with Jan- 
dorf. 

‘‘Most willingly, my dear,” 
he said. “Have you ever no- 
ticed that kindergarten lan- 
guage can be far honester than 
the adult tongues? Fewer fic- 
tions. Well, several of us 
hashed over the Lysmov game 
until three o’clock this morn- 
ing. Lysmov wouldn’t, though. 
Neither would Votbinnik ar 
Jal. You see, I have my comr 
munication problems with the 
Russians too. 

“We finally decided that 
Lysmov had managed to guess 



with complete accuracy both 
the depth at which the Ma- 
chine is analyzing in the open- 
ing and middle game (ten 
moves ahead instead of eight, 
we think — a prodigious 
achievement!) and also the 
main value scale in terms of 
which the Machine selects its 
move. 

“Having that information, 
Lysmov managed to play into 
a combination which would 
give the Machine a maximum 
plus value in its value scale 
(win of Lysmov’s queen, it 
was) after ten moves but a 
checkmate for Lysmov on his 
second move after the first 
ten. A human chess master 
would have seen a trap like 
that, but the Machine could 
not, because Lysmov was ma- 
neuvering in an area that did 
not exist for the Machine’s 
perfect but limited mind. Of 
course the Machine changed 
its tactics after the first three 
moves of the ten had been 
p 1 a y e d — it could see the 
checkmate then — ^but by that 
time it was too late for it to 
avert a disastrous loss of ma- 
terial. It was tricky of Lys- 
mov, but completely fair. Af- 
ter this we’ll all be watching 
for the opportunity to play 
the same sort of trick on the 
Machine. 

YSMOV was the first of 

-■-^us to realize fully that 
we are not playing against a 
metal monster but against a 
certain kind of programming. 
If there are any weaknesses 



THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE 



87 




we can spot in that program- 
ming, we can win. Very much 
in the same way that we can 
again and again defeat a flesh- 
and-blood player when we dis- 
cover that he consistently at- 
tacks without having an ad- 
vantage in position or is regu- 
larly overcautious about 
launching a counter-attack 
when he himself is attacked 
without justification.’' 

Sandra nodded eagerly. ‘‘So 
from now on your chances of 
beating the Machine should 
keep improving, shouldn’t 
they? I mean as you find out 
more and more about the pro- 
gramming.” 

Doc smiled. “You forget,” 
he said gently, “that Simon 
Great can change the program- 
ming before each new game. 
Now I see why he fought so 
hard for that point.” 

“Oh. Say, Doc, what’s this 
about the Sherevsky end 
game?” 

“You are picking up the 
language, aren’t you?” he ob- 
served. “Sherevsky got a lit- 
tle angry when he discovered 
that Great had the Machine 
programmed to analyze steadi- 
ly on the next move after an 
adjournment until the game 
was resumed next morning. 
Sherevsky questioned wheth- 
er it was fair for the Machine 
to ‘think’ all night while its 
opponent had to get some rest. 
Vanderhoef decided for the 
Machine, , though Sherevsky 
may carry the protest to 
FIDE. 

“Bah — I think Great wants 

86 



us to get heated up over such 
minor matters, just as he is 
happy (and oh so obliging!) 
when we complain about how 
the Machine blinks or hums or 
smells. It keeps our minds off 
the main business of trying to 
outguess his programming. In- 
cidentally, that is one thing 
we decided last night — Sher- 
evsky, Willie Angler, Jan- 
dorf, Serek, and myself — that 
we are all going to have to 
learn to play the Machine 
without letting it get on our 
nerves and without asking to 
be protected from it. As Wil- 
lie puts it, ‘So suppose it 
sounds like a boiler factory 
even — okay, you can think in 
a boiler factory.’ Myself, I am 
not so sure of that, but his 
spirit is right.” 

Sandra felt herself perking 
up as a new article began to 
shape itself in her mind. She 
said, “And what about WBM 
replacing Simon Great?” 
Again Doc smiled. “I think, 
my dear, that you can safely 
dismiss that as just a rumor. I 
think that Simon Great has 
just begun to fight.” 

VI 

R ound Four saw the Ma- 
chine spring the first of 
its surprises. 

It had finally forced a draw 
against Sherevsky in the 
morning session, ending the 
long second-round game, and 
now was matched against Vot- 
binnik. 

The Machine opened Pawn 
by FRITZ LEIBER 




to King Four, Votbinnik re- 
plied Pawn to King Three. 

‘'The French Defense, Bin- 
ny’s favorite,” Dave muttered 
and they settled back for the 
Machine’s customary four- 
minute wait. 

Instead the Machine moved 
at once and punched its clock. 

Sandra, studying Votbinnik 
through her glasses, decided 
that the Russian grandmaster 
looked just a trifle startled. 
Then he made his move. 

Once again the Machine re- 
sponded instantly. 

There was a flurry of com- 
ment from the stands and a 
scurrying-about of officials to 
shush it. Meanwhile the Ma- 
chine continued to make its 
moves at better than rapid- 
transit speed, although Vot- 
binnik soon began to take 
rather more time on his. 

The upshot was that the 
Machine made eleven moves 
before it started to take time 
to ‘think’ at all. 

Sandra clamored so excited- 
ly to Dave for an explanation 
that she had two officials wav- 
ing at her angrily. 

As soon as he dared, Dave 
whispered, “Great must have 
banked on Votbinnik playing 
the French — almost always 
does — ^and fed all the varia- 
tions of the French into the 
Machine’s ‘memory’ from 
MCO and maybe some other 
books. So long as Votbinnik 
stuck to a known variation of 
the French, why, the Machine 
could play from memory with- 
out analyzing at all. Then 

THE 64.SQUARE MADHOUSE 



when a strange move came 
along — one that wasn’t in its 
memory — only on the twelfth 
move yet! — ^^the Machine went 
back to analyzing, only now 
it’s taking longer and going 
deeper because it’s got more 
time — six minutes a move, 
about. The only thing I won- 
der is why Great didn’t have 
the Machine do it in the first 
three games. It seems so ob- 
vious.” 

Sandra ticketed that in her 
mind as a question for Doc. 
She slipped off to her room to 
write her “Don’t Let a Robot 
Get Your Goat” article (draw- 
ing heavily on Doc’s observa- 
tions) and got back to the 
stands twenty minutes before 
the second time-control point. 
It was becoming a regular rou- 
tine. 

Votbinnik was a knight 
down — almost certainly bust- 
ed, Dave explained. 

“It got terrifically compli- 
cated while you were gone,” 
he said. “A real Votbinnik 
position.” 

“Only the Machine out- 
binniked him,” Bill finished. 

Judy hummed Beethoven’s 
“Funeral March for the Death 
of a Hero.” 

Nevertheless Votbinnik did 
not resign. The Machine 
sealed a move. Its board 
blacked out and Vanderhoef, 
with one of his assistants 
standing beside him to wit- 
ness, privately read the move 
off a small indicator on the 
console. Tomorrow he would 
feed the move back into the 

69 




Machine when play was re- 
sumed at the rooming session. 

Doc sealed a move too al- 
though he was two pawns 
down in his game against 
Grabo and looked tired to 
death. 

“They don’t give up easily, 
do they?” Sandra observed to 
Dave. “They must really love 
the game. Or do they hate it?” 

“When you get to psychol- 
ogy it’s all beyond me,” Dave 
replied. “Ask me something 
else.” 

Sandra smiled. “Thank you, 
Dave,” she said. “I will.” 

C OME the morning session, 
Votbinnik played on for a 
do7en moves then resigned. 

A little later Doc managed 
to draw his game with Grabo 
by perpetual check. He caught 
sight of Sandra coming down 
from the stands and waved to 
her, then made the motions of 
drinking. 

N'yw he looks almost like a 
hoy, Sandra thought as she 
joined him. 

“Say, Doc,” she asked when 
they had secured a table, “why 
is a rook worth more than a 
bishop?” 

He darted a suspicious 
glance at her. “That is not 
your kind of question,” he 
said sternly. “Exactly what 
have you been up to?” 

Sandra confessed that she 
had asked Dave to teach her 
how to play chess. 

‘T knew those children 
would corrupt you,” Doc said 
somberly. “Look, my dear, if 

90 



you learn to play chess you 
won’t be able to write your 
clever little articles about it. 
Besides, as I warned you the 
first day, chess is a madness. 
Women are ordinarily im- 
mune, but that doesn’t justify 
you taking chances with your 
sanity.” 

“But I’ve kind of gotten in- 
terested, watching the tourna- 
ment,” Sandra objected. “At 
least I’d like to know how the 
pieces move.” 

“Stop!” Doc commanded. 
“You’re already in danger. Di- 
rect your mind somewhere 
else. Ask me a sensible, down- 
to-e a r t h journalist’s ques- 
tion — something completely 
irrational !” 

“Okay, why didn’t Simon 
Great have the Machine set to 
play the openings fast in the 
first three games?” 

“Hah! I think Great plays 
Lasker-chess in his program- 
ming. He hides his strength 
and tries.to win no more easily 
than he has to, so he will have 
resources in reserve. The Ma- 
chine loses to Lysmov and im- 
mediately starts playing more 
strongly — the psychological 

impression made on the other 
players by such tactics is for- 
midable.” 

“But the Machine isn’t 
ahead yet?” 

“No, of course not. After 
four rounds Lysmov is lead- 
ing the tournament with 
3% — Yiy meaning 354 in the 
win column and 54 in the loss 
column. ” 

“How do you half win a 

by FRITZ LEIBER 




game of chess? Or half lose 
one?** Sandra interrupted. 

‘'By drawing a game — play- 
ing to a tie. Lysmov*s 3^ - ^ 
is notational shorthand for 
three wins and a draw. Under- 
stand? My dear, I don’t usual- 
ly have to explain things to 
you in such detail.** 

“I just didn’t want you to 
think I was learning too much 
about chess.** 

“Ho! Well, to get on with 
the score after four rounds. 
Angler and Votbinnik both 
have 3 — 1, while the Machine 
is bracketed at 2^ — 1J4 with 
Jal. But the Machine has cre- 
ated an impression of 
strength, as if it were all set 
to come from behind with a 
rush.’* He shook his head. “At 
the moment, my dear,’* he said, 
“I feel very pessimistic about 
the chances of neurons against 
relays in this tournament. Re- 
lays don’t panic and fag. But 
the oddest thing. .** 

“Yes?’* Sandra prompted. 
“Well, the oddest thing is 
that the Machine doesn’t play 
‘like a machine* at all. It uses 
dynamic strategy, the kind we 
sometimes call ‘Russian’, com- 
plicating each position as 
much as possible and creating 
maximum tension. But that 
too is a matter of the program- 
ming. 

D OC'S foreboding was ful- 
filled as round followed 
hard-fought round. In the 
next five days (there was a 
weekend recess) the Machine 
successively smashed Jandorf, 

THE 64 SQUARE MADHOUSE 



Serek and Jal and after seven 
rounds was out in front by a 
full point. 

Jandorf, evidently im- 
pressed by the Machine’s 
flawless opening play against 
Votbinnik, chose an inferior 
line in the Ruy Lopez to get 
the Machine “out of the 
books.’’ Perhaps he hoped that 
the Machine would go on 
blindly making book moves, 
but the Machine did not 
oblige. It immediately slowed 
its play, “thought hard” and 
annihilated the Argentinian in 
25 moves. 

Doc commented, “The Wild 
Bull of the Pampas tried to 
use the living force of his hu- 
man personality to pull a fast 
one and swindle the Machine. 
Only the Machine didn’t 
swindle.” 

Against Jal, the Machine 
used a new wrinkle. It used 
a variable amount of time on 
moves, apparently according 
to how difficult it “judged” 
the position to be. 

When Serek got a poor 
pawn-position the Machine 
simplified the game relent- 
lessly, suddenly discarding its 
hitherto “Russian” strategy. 
“It plays like anything but a 
machine,” Doc commented. 
“We know the reason all too 
well — Simon Great — but do- 
ing something about it is 
something else again. Great is 
hitting at our individual weak- 
nesses wonderfully well. 
Though I think I could play 
brilliant psychological chess 
myself if I had a machine to 

91 




do the detail work.” Doc 
sounded a bit wistful. 

The audiences grew in size 
and in expensiveness of ward- 
robe, though most of the cafe 
society types made their visits 
fleeting ones. Additional 
stands were erected. A hard- 
liquor bar was put in and then 
taken out. The problem of 
keeping reasonable order and 
quiet became an unending one 
for Vanderhoef, who had to 
ask for more “hushers.’* The 
number of scientists and com- 
puter men. Navy, Army and 
Space Force uniforms were 
more in evidence. Dave and 
Bill turned up one morning 
with a three-dimensional chess 
set of transparent plastic and 
staggered Sandra by assuring 
her that most bright young 
space scientists were moder- 
ately adept at this 512-square 
game. 

Sandra heard that WBM 
had snagged a big order from 
the War Department. She also 
heard that a Syndicate man 
had turned up with a book on 
the tournament, taking bets 
from the more heavily heeled 
types and that a detective was 
circulating about, trying to 
spot him. 

The newspapers kept up 
their f r o n t-page reporting, 
most of the writers personal- 
izing the Machine heavily and 
rather too cutely. Several of 
the papers started regular 
chess columns and ‘‘How to 
Play Chess” features. There 
was a flurry of pictures of 
movie starlets and such sitting 



at chess boards. Hollywood re- 
vealed plans for two chess 
movies: “They Made Her a 
Black Pawn” and “The Mon- 
ster From King Rook Square”. 
Chess novelties and costume 
jewelry appeared. The United 
States Chess Federation 
proudly reported a phenome- 
nal rise in membership. 

S ANDRA learned enough 
chess to be able to blunder 
through a game with Dave 
without attempting more than 
one illegal move in five, to 
avoid the Scholar’s Mate most 
of the time and to be able to 
checkmate with two rooks 
though not with one. Judy had 
asked her, “Is he pleased that 
you’re learning chess?” 

Sandra had replied, “No, he 
thinks it is a madness.” The 
kids had all whooped at that 
and Dave had said, “How 
right he is!” 

Sandra was scraping the 
bottom of the barrel for topics 
for her articles, but then it oc- 
cured to her to write about the 
kids, which worked out nice- 
ly, and that led to a humorous 
article “Chess Is for Brains” 
about her own efforts to learn 
the game, and for the nth time 
in her career she thought of 
herself as practically a col- 
umnist and was accordingly 
elated. 

After his two draws. Doc 
lost three games in a row and 
still bs:d the Machine to face 
and then Sherevsky. His 
1 — 6 score gave him undis- 
puted possession of last place.

He grew very depressed. He 
still made a point of squiring 
her about before the playing 
sessions, but she had to make 
most of the conversation. His 
rare flashes of humor were 
rather macabre. 

‘‘They have Dirty Old 
Krakatower locked in the cel- 
lar/' he muttered just before 
the start of the next to the 
last round, “and now they 
send the robot down to de- 
stroy him.” 

“Just the same, Doc,” 
Sandra told him, “good luck.” 

Doc shook his head. 
“Against a man luck might 
help. But against a Machine?” 

“It’s not the Machine you’re 
playing, but the programming. 
Remember?” 

“Yes, but it’s the Machine 
that doesn’t make the mis- 
take. And a mistake is what I 
need most of all today. Some- 
body else’s,” 

Doc must have looked very 
dispirited and tired when he 
left Sandra in the stands, for 
Judy (Dave and Bill not hav- 
ing arrived yet) asked in a 
confidential, womanly sort of 
voice, “What do you do for 
him when he’s so unhappy?” 

“Oh, I’m especially passion- 
ate,” Sandra heard herself an- 
swer. 

“Is that good for him?” 
Judy demanded doubtfully. 

“Sh !” Sandra said, some- 
what aghast at her irresponsi- 
bility and wondering if she 
were getting tournan>ent- 
nerves. “Sh, they’re starting 
the clocks.” 



K rakatower had lost 

two pawns when the first 
time-control point arrived and 
was intending to resign on his 
31st move when the Machine 
broke down. Three of its 
pieces moved on the electric 
board at once, then the board 
went dark and all the lights 
on the console went out ex- 
cept five which started wink- 
ing like angry red eyes. The 
gray-smocked men around 
Simon Great sprang silently 
into action, filing around back 
of the console. It was the first 
work anyone had seen them do 
except move screens around 
and fetch each other coffee. 
Vanderhoef hovered anxious- 
ly. Some flash bulbs went off. 
Vanderhoef shook his fist at 
the photographers. Simon 
Great did nothing. The Ma- 
chine’s clock ticked on. Doc 
watched for a while and then 
fell asleep. 

When Vanderhoef jogged 
him awake, the Machine had 
just made its next move, but 
the repair-job had taken 50 
minutes. As a result the Ma- 
chine had to make 15 moves in 
10 minutes. At 40 seconds a 
move it played like a dub 
whose general lack of skill 
was complicated by a touch of 
insanity. On his 43rd move 
Doc shrugged his shoulders 
apologetically and announced 
mate in four. There were more 
flashes. Vanderhoef shook his 
fist again. The machine 
flashed: 



THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE 



93 





04 



by FRITZ LEIBER 





YOU PLAYED BRILLI- 
ANTLY. CONGRATULA- 
TIONS! 

Afterwards Doc said sourly 
to Sandra. “And that was one 
big lie — a child could have 
beat the Machine with that 
time advantage. Oh, what an 
ironic glory the gods reserved 
for Krakatower’s dotage — to 
vanquish a broken-down com- 
puter ! Only one good thing 
about it — that it didn't happen 
while it was playing one of 
the Russians, or someone 
would surely have whispered 
sabotage. And that is some- 
thing of which they do not ac- 
cuse Dirty Old Krakatower, 
because they are sure he has 
not got the brains even to 
think to sprinkle a little mag- 
netic oxide powder in the Ma- 
chine’s memory box. Bah!” 

Just the same he seemed 
considerably more cheerful. 

Sandra said guilelessly, 
“Winning a game means noth- 
ing to you chess players, does 
it, unless you really do it by 
your own brilliancy?” 

Doc looked solemn for a 
moment, then he started to 
chuckle. “You are getting al- 
together too smart. Miss 
Sandra Lea Grayling,” he said. 
“Yes, yes — a chess player is 
happy to win in any barely 
legitimate way he can, by an 
earthquake if necessary, or his 
opponent sickening before he 
does from the bubonic plague. 
So— I confess it to you — I 
was very happy to chalk up 
my utterly undeserved win 

THE 64-SQUARC MADHOUSE 



over the luckless Machine.” 

“Which incidentally makes 
it anybody’s tournament again, 
doesn’t it. Doc?” 

^^^JTOT exactly.” Doc gave a 
wry little headshake. 
“We can’t expect another 
fluke. After all, the Machine 
has functioned perfectly seven 
games out of eight, and you 
can bet the WBM men will be 
checking it all night, especial- 
ly since it has no adjourned 
games to work on. Tomorrow 
it plays Willie Angler, but 
judging from the way it beat 
Votbinnik and Jal, it should 
have a definite edge on Wil- 
lie. If it beats him, then only 
Votbinnik has a chance for a 
tie and to do that he must de- 
feat Lysmov. Which will be 
most difficult.” 

“Well,” Sandra said, “don’t 
you think that Lysmov might 
just kind of let himself be 
beaten, to make sure a Rus- 
sian gets first place or at least 
ties for it?” 

Doc shook his head em- 
phatically. “There are many 
things a man, even a chess 
master, will do to serve his 
state, but party loyalty 
doesn’t go that deep. Look, 
here is the standing of the 
players after eight rounds.” 
He handed Sandra a penciled 
list.

Jal VS. Serek 

Shercvsky vs. Krakatower 
Jandorf vs. Grabo 

After studying the list for 
a ivhile, Sandra said, “Hey, 
even Angler could come out 
first, couldn’t he, if he beat 
the Machine and Votbinnik 
lost to L)7smov?” 

‘’Could, could — yes. But I’m 
afraid that’s hoping for too 
much, barring another break- 
down. To tell the truth, dear, 
the Machine is simply too 
good for all of us. If it were 
only a little faster (and these 
technological improvements 
always come) it would out- 
class us completely. We are 
at that fleeting moment of 
balance when genius is al- 
most good enough to equal 
mechanism. It makes me feel 
sad, but proud too in a morbid 
fashion, to think that I am in 
at the death of grandmaster 
chess. Oh, I suppose the game 
will always be played, but it 
won’t ever be quite the same.” 
He blew out a breath and 
shrugged his shoulders. 

**As for Willie, he's a good 



one and he’ll give the Machine 
a long hard fight, you can de- 
pend on it. He might conceiv- 
ably even draw.” 

He touched Sandra’s arm. 
“Cheer up, my dear,” he said. 
“You should remind yourself 
that a victory for the Machine 
is still a victory for the USA.” 

D OC’S prediction about a 
long hard fight was de- 
cidedly not fulfilled. 

Having White, the Machine 
opened Pawn to King Four 
and Angler went into the Si- 
cilian Defense. For the first 
twelve moves on each side 
both adversaries pushed their 
pieces and tapped their clocks 
at such lightning speed (Van- 
derhoef feeding in Angler’s 
moves swiftly) that up in the 
stands Bill and Judy were 
still flipping pages madly in 
their hunt for the right col- 
umn in MCO. 

The Machine made its thir- 
teenth move, still at blitz 
tempo. 

“Bishop takes Pawn, check, 
and mate in three!” Willie anr 
nounced very loudly, made the 
move, banged his clock and 
sat back. 

There was a collective gasp- 
and-gabble from the stands. 

Dave squeezed Sandra’s arm 
hard. Then for once forgetting 
that he was Dr. Caution, he 
demanded loudly of Bill and 
Judy, “Have you two idiots 
found that column yet? The 
Machine*s thirteenth move is a 
boner 

Pinning down the reference

with a fingernail, Judy cried, 
‘'Yes! Here it is on page 161 
in footnote (e) (2) (B). Dave, 
that same thirteenth move for 
White is in the book! But 
Black replies Knight to Queen 
Two, not Bishop takes Pawn, 
check. And three moves later 
the book gives White a plus 
value.’' 

“What the heck, it can’t be," 
Bill asserted. 

“But it is. Check for your- 
self. That boner is in the 
book** 

“Shut up, everybody!’’ Dave 
ordered, clapping his hands to 
his face. When he dropped 
them a moment later his eyes 
gleamed. “I got it now! 
Angler figured they were us- 
ing the latest edition of MCO 
to program the Machine on 
openings, he found an editori- 
al error and then he deliber- 
ately played the Machine into 
that variation!" 

Dave practically shouted his 
last words, but that attracted 
no attention as at that moment 
the whole hall was the noisiest 
it had been throughout the 
tournament. It simmered down 
somewhat as the Machine 
flashed a move. 

Angler replied instantly. 

The Machine replied almost 
as soon as Angler’s move was 
fed into it. 

Angler moved again, his 
move was fed into the Ma- 
chine and the Machine 
flashed : 

I AM CHECKMATED. 
CONGRATULATIONS ! 



N ext morning Sandra 
heard Dave’s guess con- 
firmed by both Angler and 
Great. Doc had spotted them 
having coffee and a malt to- 
gether and he and Sandra 
joined them. 

Doc was acting jubilant, 
having just drawn his ad- 
journed game with Sherevsky, 
which meant, since Jandorf 
had beaten Grabo, that he was 
in undisputed possession of 
Ninth Place. They were all 
waiting for the finish of the 
V o t b i n n i k-Lysmov game, 
which would decide the final 
standing of the leaders. Willie 
Angler was complacent and 
Simon Great was serene and 
at last a little more talkative. 

“You know, Willie,’’ the 
psychologist said, “I was 
afraid that one of you boys 
would figure out something 
like that. That was the chief 
reason I didn’t have the Ma- 
chine use the programmed 
openings until Lysmov’s win 
forced me to. I couldn’t check 
every opening line in MCO 
and the Archives and Shak-- 
hmaty. There wasn’t time. As 
it was, we had a dozen typists 
and proofreaders busy for 
weeks preparing that part of 
the programming and making 
sure it was accurate as far as 
following the books went. Tell 
the truth now, Willie, how 
many friends did you have 
hunting for flaws in the latest 
edition of MCO?’’ 

Willie grinned. “Your un-

lucky 13th. Well, that’s my 
secret. Though I’ve always 
said that anyone joining the 
Willie Angler Fan Club ought 
to expect to have to pay some 
day for the privilege. They’re 
sharp, those little guys, and I 
work their tails off.” 

Simon Great laughed and 
said to Sandra, ”Your young 
friend Dave was pretty sharp 
himself to deduce what had 
happened so quickly. Willie, 
you ought to have him in the 
Bleeker Street Irregulars.” 
Sandra said, ‘T get the im- 
pression he’s planning to start 
a club of his own.” 

Angler snorted. ”That’s the 
one trouble with my little 
guys. They’re all waiting to 
topple me.” 

Simon Great said, *'W^11, so 
long as Willie is passing up 
Dave, I want to talk to him. 
It takes real courage in a 
youngster to question author- 
ity.” 

”How should he get in 
touch with you?” Sandra 
asked. 

While Great told her, Wil- 
lie studied them frowningly. 

“Si, are you planning to 
stick in this chess-program- 
ming racket?” he demanded. 

Simon Great did not answer 
the question. ”You try telling 
me something, Willie,” he 
said. “Have you been ap- 
proached the last couple of 
days by IBM?” 

“You mean asking me to 
take over your job?” 

“I said /BM, Willie.” 
“Oh.” Willie’s grin became 



a tight one. “I’m not talking.” 

T here was a flurry of 
sound and movement 
around the playing tables. 
Willie sprang up. 

“Lysmov’s agreed to a 
draw!” he informed them a 
moment later. “The gangster!” 
“Gangster because he puts 
you in equal first place with 
Votbinnik, both of you ahead 
of the Machine?” Great in- 
quired gently. 

“Ahh, he could have beat 
Binny, giving me sole first. 
A Russian gangster!” 

Doc shook a finger. “Lys- 
mov could also have lost to 
Votbinnik, Willie, putting 
)^ou in second place.” 

“Don’t think evil thoughts. 
So long, pals.” 

As Angler clattered down 
the stairs, Simon Great signed 
the waiter for more coffee, lit 
a fresh cigarette, took a deep 
drag and leaned back. 

“You know,” he said “it’s a 
great relief not to have to im- 
personate the hyperconfident 
programmer for awhile. Being 
a psychologist has spoiled me 
for that sort of thing. I’m not 
as good as I once was at beat- 
ing people over the head with 
my ego.” 

“You didn’t do too badly,” 
Doc said. , 

“Thanks. Actually, WBM is 
very much pleased with the 
Machine’s performance. The 
Machine’s flaws made it seem 
more real and more news- 
worthy, especially how it 
functioned when the going

got tough — those repairs the 
boys made under time pres- 
sure in your game, Savilly, 
will help sell WBM computers 
or I miss my guess. In fact 
nobody could have watched 
the tournament for long 
without realizing there were 
nine smart rugged men out 
there, ready to kill that com- 
puter if they could. The Ma- 
chine passed a real test. And 
then the whole deal drama- 
tizes what computers are 
and what they can and can't 
do. And not just at the pop- 
ular level. The WBM re- 
search boys are learning a lot 
about computer and program- 
ming theory by studying how 
the Machine and its program- 
mer behave under tournament 
stress. It's a kind of test un- 
like that provided by any 
other computer work. Just 
this morning, for instance, 
one of our big mathemati- 
cians told me that he is be- 
ginning to think that the 
Theory of Games does apply 
to chess, because you can 
bluff and counterbluff with 
your programming. And Fm 
learning about human psy- 
chology." 

Doc chuckled. ‘'Such as 
that even human thinking is 
just a matter of how you 
program your own mind? — 
that we're all like the Ma- 
chine to that extent?" 

“That's one of the big 
points, Savilly. Yes.” 

Doc smiled at Sandra. “You 
wrote a nice little news-story, 
dear, about how Man con- 

THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE 



quered the Machine by a pal- 
pitating nose and won a vic- 
tory for international amity. 

“Now the story starts to go 
deeper.” 

44 A lot of things go deeper,” 
Sandra replied, looking 
at him evenly. “Much deeper 
than you ever expect at the 
start." 

The big electric scoreboard 
lit up.

“It was a good tournament,” 
Doc said. “And the Machine 
has proven itself a grand- 
master. It must make you feel 
good, Simon, after being out 
of tournament chess for twen- 
ty years.” 

The psychologist nodded. 

“Will you go back to psy- 
chology now?" Sandra asked 
him. 

Simon Great smiled. “I can 
answer that question honestly. 
Miss Grayling, because the 
news is due for release. No. 
WBM is pressing for entry of 
the Machine in the Interzonal 
Candidates’ Tournament. 

99 




They want a crack at the 
World's Championship.” 

Doc raised his eyebrows. 
“That's news indeed. But look, 
Simon, with the knowledge 
you've gained in this tourna- 
ment won’t you be able to 
make the Machine almost a 
sure winner in every game?'' 

“I don't know. Players like 
Angler and Lysnwv may find 
some more flaws in its func- 
tioning and dream up some 
new stratagems. Besides, 
there's another solution to the 
problems raised by having a 
single computer entered in a 
grandmaster tournament.'' 

Doc sat up straight. “You 
mean having more program- 
mer-computer teams than just 
one?'' 

“Exactly. The Russians are 
bound to give their best play- 
ers computers, considering 
the prestige the game has in 
Russia. And I wasn’t asking 
Willie that question about 
IBM just on a hunch. Chess 
tournaments are a wonderful 
way to test rival , computers 
and show them off to the pub- 
lic, just like cross-crountry 
races were for the early auto- 
mobiles. The future grandmas- 
ter will inevitably be a pro- 
grammer-computer team, a 
man-machine symbiotic part- 
nership, probably with more 
freedom each way than I was 
allowed in this tournament— -I 
mean the man taking oyer the 
play in some positions, the ma- 
chine in others.’* 

“You’re making my head 
swim,'' Sandra said. 



is in the same 
-‘•▼-■•storm-tossed o c e a n,” 
Doc assured her. “Simon, that 
will be very fine for the mas- 
ters who can get themselves 
computers — either from their 
governments or from hiring 
out to big firms. Or in other 
ways. Jandorf, I’m sure, will 
be able to interest some Ar- 
gentinian millionaire in a 
computer for him. While I . 
oh, I'm too old. .still, when 
I start to think about it... 
But what about the Bela 
Grabos? Incidentally, did you 
know that Grabo is contesting 
Jandorf 's win? Claims Jan- 
dorf discussed the position 
with Serek. I think they ex- 
changed about two words.” 
Simon shrugged, “The Bela 
Grabos will have to continue 
to fight their own battles, if 
necessary satisfying them- 
selves with the lesser tourna- 
ments. Believe me, Savilly, 
from now on grandmaster 
chess without one or more 
computers entered will lack 
sauce.” 

Dr. Krakatower shook his 
head and said, “Thinking gets 
more expensive every year.” 
From the floor came the 
harsh voice of Igor Jandorf 
and the shrill one of Bela Gra- 
bo raised in anger. Three 
words came through clearly: 
“. .1 challenge you. .” 

Sandra said, “Well, there’s 
something you can’t build into 
a machine — ego.” 

“dh, I don’t know about 
that,” said Simon Great.

It’s tough to see into minds when 

you’re only a child and tougher 

still when you see what scares you! 

GRAMP 



By Charles V. De Vet 



UTI77HY is Gramma making 
mad pictures at you?” 
I asked Cramp. 

Gramp looked at me, ”What 
pictures, Chum?” 

“Pictures in her mind like 
you're lazy. And like she 
wanted to hurt you,” I said. 

Cramp’s eyes got wide. He 
kept looking at me, and then 
he said, “Get your cap. Chum. 
We’re gonna take a little 
walk.” 

Gramp didn’t say anything 
until we walked all the way 
to the main road and past Mr. 
Watchorn’s corn field. I 
walked behind him, counting 
the little round holes his 
wooden leg made in the grav- 
el. Finally Gramp said, “Abra- 
cadabra.” 

That was our secret worcL 



It meant that if I was play- 
ing one of our games, I was 
to stop for awhile. Gramp and 
I had lots of games we played. 
One of them was where wc 
made believe. Sometimes we’d 
play that Gramp and I had 
been working all day, when 
we really just stayed in the 
shade telling stories. Then 
when we got home and Gram- 
ma as'^ked us what we had 
done, we’d tell her about how 
hard we had worked. 

“I really did see mad pic- 
tures in Gramma’s mind,” I 
said. 

“Have you ever seen pic- 
tures in anybody’s mind be- 
fore?” Gramp asked. 

“I always see them,” I said. 
“Don’t you?” 

“No,” Gramp said after a 



101 





minute. ''Other people can't 
cither. You're probably the 
only little boy who can.” 

"Is that bad?” 

"No,” Gramp answered. "It's 
good. But remember how I 
told you that people don’t like 
other people who are differ- 
ent? Well, even though see- 
ing pictures like you do is a 
wonderful thing, other people 
won’t like you if they know 
you can do it. So we’ll just 
keep it a secret between us.” 
I was glad Gramp told me, 
because he always knows the 
best things to do. I’m his 
Chum. I love him better than 
anyone else in the whole 
world. Whenever the other 
kids tease me and call me 
Crazy Joe I go to Gramp and 
he tells me funny stories and 
makes me laugh. 

1 remember the first time he 
told me about people hating 
other people who are differ- 
ent. 

"Why do the kids call me 
Crazy Joe and laugh at me?” 
I asked him. 

"Well, you see,” Gramp said 
slowly, "your Daddy worked 
for Uncle Sam in a big place 
where they make things that 
the government won’t tell 
anybody about. Then your 
Daddy got sick from some- 
thing in the big place. After 
a long time he went up to 
stay with God. Then God took 
Mommy too, when He gave 
you to her. And now you’re 
our little boy, mine and Gram- 
ma’s. And because you’re a 

102 



very special kind of little boy, 
the other children are jealous. 
So I wouldn’t play with them 
any more if they tease you. 
Just don’t let them see you’re 
afraid of them. You’ll always 
be Gramp’s Little Joe.” 

I love Gramp very much . 
We kept walking until we 
came to Fayette. We went 
into Carl Van Remortal’s 
store. Gramp sat on a chair by 
the big iron stove and I sat 
on his knee on his good leg. 
The stove must be real old, 
because it’s got 1926 on its 
door in big iron letters. 

"Tell me the pictures you 
see in Mr. Van’s mind,” Gramp 
whispered in my ear, "but 
don’t let him hear you.” 

"He’s making pictures of 
the fishing boats coming in,” 
I ^said. "In the pictures he’s 
talking to Jack La Salle and 
giving him some money for 
his fish... The pictures are 
getting all mixed up now. He’s 
putting the fish in ice in box- 
es, but other pictures show 
him in church. Jack La Salle 
is in the church too, and Mr. 
Van’s sister Margaret is 
dressed in a long white dress 
and standing alongside him.” 
"He’s thinking that Jack La 
Salle will be marrying Mar- 
garet pretty soon,” Gramp 
said. "What else is he think- 
ing?” 

"The pictures are coming so 
fast now that I can’t name 
them all,” I said. 

Mr. Lawrence St. Ours came 
into the store, and Gramp told 
me to read what he was think- 

by Charles V. De Vet 




ing. I looked inside his head. 

‘‘He’s making pictures of 
himself driving a car, and buy- 
ing bread, and bacon, and pil- 
ing hay on his farm, and...*^ 
I said, but then I had to stop. 
“All the pictures come so fast 
that I can’t read them,” I told 
Gramp. “Everybody makes 
blurry pictures like that most 
of the time.” 

“Instead of trying to tell 
me what the pictures are, see 
if you can understand what 
they mean,” Gramp said. 

I tried but it was awful hard 
and pretty soon I got tired 
and Gramp and I left the 
store and went back home. 

The next morning Gramp 
and I went ouF in the barn 
and Gramp said, “Now let’s 
see what we got here.” He had 
me try to do a lot of things, 
like lifting something without 
touching it, and trying to 
make chickens run by making 
a picture of them doing that 
and putting it in their minds. 
But I couldn’t do any of them. 

After a while he said, “Let’s 
go down to the store again.” 

W ’^E went to the store al- 
most every day after that. 
Then sometimes we just 
walked around Fayette, and 
Gramp had me practice read- 
ing what the pictures in peo- 
ple’s minds meant instead of 
just what they looked like. 
Sometimes I did it real good. 
Then Gramp would buy me 
some candy or ice cream. 

One day we were following 
Mr. Mears and 1 was telling 
GRAMP 



Gramp what I saw in Mr. 
Mears’ mind when Mr. St. 
Ours drove by in his car. “Mr. 
Mears is making pictures 
about feeding meat to Mr. St. 
Ours’s dog and the dog is 
crawling away and dying,” I 
said to Gramp. 

Gramp was real interested. 
He said, “Watch close and 
read everything you can about 
that.” I did. After, Gramp 
seemed very happy. He bought 
me a big chocolate bar that 
time. Chocolate is my best 
kind of candy. 

I read lots of things in oth- 
er people’s minds that made 
Gramp feel good too, and he 
bought me candy just about 
every day. 

Gramp seemed to have mon- 
ey all the time now instead 
of having to ask Gramma for 
any. She wanted to know 
where he got all the money. 
But he just smiled with his 
right cheek like he does and 
wouldn’t tell her. Most of the 
people in town didn’t seem to 
like Gramp any more. They 
made mad pictures about him 
whenever we met them. 

Sometimes when we were in 
the store Mrs. Van would 
come in and she would talk 
to me. She was awful nice. 
But she always had sad pic- 
tures in her mind and some- 
times she would cough real 
hard and hold a handkerchief 
up in front of her mouth. 

When she did that Mr. Van 
used to get sad too. In his 
pictures Mrs. Van would be 
dead and laying in a coffin 

103 




And they would be burying 
her in a big hole in the 
ground. Mr. Van was nice too. 
He gave me crackers and 
cookies, or sometimes a big 
thin slice of cheese. 

One night Gramp was hold- 
ing me and buying some gro- 
ceries and Mr. Van was put- 
ting them in a cardboard box, 
and he was thinking about go- 
ing to the bank in Escanaba 
and cashing a check. And the 
man gave him a big handful 
of money. 

I told Gramp, but then Mr. 
Van came close. I didn’t say 
an)miore, like Gramp had told 
me. Mr. Van was whistling 
now. He made pictures of giv- 
ing the money to Mrs. Van. 
She was getting on a train and 
going to a place where it was 
sunny all the time, and her 
cough went away and she 
wasn’t skinny any more. In 
his mind Mrs. Van was real 
pretty. She didn’t have the 
long nose like she really has. 

When we got in our car 
Gramp was excited. He asked 
me where Mr. Van had put 
the money he brought back 
from Escanaba. 

He had bad pictures in his 
mind about taking Mr. Van’s 
money and I didn’t want to 
tell him. But he grabbed my 
arm so hard it hurt and I be- 
gan to cry. Gramp never hurt 
me before. 

‘‘What are you crying for?” 
he asked me, cranky. 

“I don’t want you to take 
Mr. Van’s money,” I told him. 

Gramp let go of my arm and 

104 



didn’t say anything for a 
while. 

“Sometimes the pictures you 
see aren’t true,” he said. “You 
know that.” He took out his 
blue handkerchief and made 
me blow my nose. “Like‘ when 
yon see pictures in Gramma’s 
mind about her hurting me,” 
he said. “She never does, you 
know. So the pictures aren’t 
true. It’s just what we call 
imagination.” 

“But your pictures are bad ! 
They make me scared,” I said. 

“We all make bad pictures 
like that, but we don’t mean 
them,” Gramp said. “Remem- 
ber how you said that you’d 
like to eat the whole apple 
pie last Sunday? You prob- 
ably made pictures of doing 
that. But you never did, be- 
cause you know that Gramma 
and me should have some of it 
too.” I guess Gramp can ex- 
plain just about everything. 

So I told him where Mr. 
Van had hid the money under 
a box of brown sugar. Gramp 
smiled and started the car. 

He let me steer while it was 
going slow. “Who’s my 
Chum?” he asked. 

“I am,” I said, and I laughed 
real happy. 

T he next day when I got 
up Gramp was gone. 

I went back of the barn and 
played. I got a bunch of tin 
cans and punched holes in 
them with a nail like Gramp 
showed me, and I made steps 
out of rocks and put a can on 
each step. I poured water in 

by Charles V. De Vet 




the top can. It ran through 
the holes from each can to the 
other all the way down the 
steps. 

I heard our car come in the 
front yard. 

I went around the barn, and 
Gramp was just going up the 
steps to the house. He had 
been to Fairport where the 
big store is, and he had bought 
a lot of things that he was 
carrying in his arms. At first 
I was , glad because he had 
bought something that was for 
me too. 

But then I saw some bad 
pictures mixed with the hap- 
py ones— of Gramp breaking a 
window in Mr. Van’s store 
when it was dark and going 
in and taking something from 
underneath the brown sugar 
box. 

“You told me you wouldn’t 
take Mr. Van’s money. And 
you did!” I said. 

“Ssh,” Gramp said. He put 
his packages on the porch and 
sat down and took me on his 
lap. He took a deep breath. 
“Remember what I told you 
about imagination, Chum?” he 
asked me. “So you know 
you’re not supposed to believe 
all the pictures you see. Now 
you’re Gramp’s Chum. And I 
want you to promise me again 
not to tell anyone but me 
what you see, and I’ll tell you 
if the pictures are real or not. 
Promise?” 

I promised, and Gramp 
opened one of the packages. 
He took out two new pistols 
and a belt with double hol- 

GRAMP 



sters to carry them in. He 
bent over and buckled them 
on me. 

“You look just like Hoppy 
now,” he said. 

I gave him a big kiss, and 
ran back of the barn to shoot 
robbers. 

TN the afternoon Gramp was 
•Splaying he was a bad In- 
dian and trying to scalp me 
when a strange car drove in 
our yard. 

Mr. Van and two men with 
badges got out. 

Mr. Van was real mad. 
“We’ve come after the mon- 
ey, Bill,” he said. 

Gramp got white. He was 
scared, but he said, loud, 
“What the hell are you talk- 
ing about?” 

“You know what, Bill,” Mr. 
Van said. “Someone saw you 
break into the store. It will 
go easier on you if you admit 
it.” 

“I told you I don’t know 
what you’re talking about,” 
Gramp said. His eyes moved 
kind of quick. Then he no- 
ticed me and he walked over 
to me. “That’s a fine way to 
talk in front of the boy,” he 
said over his shoulder. He 
took my hand. “Come on. 
Chum. We’re going in the 
house.” 

“Just a minute,” the biggest 
policeman said. “We’ve got a 
few questions that we have to 
ask you.” 

Gramp made believe he was 
brushing some dirt from my 
pants. “Did anyone see me 

105 




take the money, Chum?" he 
whispered to me. 

‘"No," I said, even though I 
didn’t understand exactly.^ 
“Mr. Van is just pretending 
he knows you took it but he 
doesn’t." 

“Good boy." Cramp patted 
me on the head. “Go into the 
house now." 

He turned and walked back 
to the three men, pushing his 
wooden leg into the ground 
hard. I didn’t go in the house, 
though. 

“Now I’ve had just about 
enough of this," Gramp said, 
with a big frown on his face. 
“You can’t bluff me. Van. Say

what you got to say, and get 
off my property." 

Mr. Van’s shoulders seemed 
to sag and he got sad. He 
made the pictures in his mind 
of Mrs. Van being dead and 
being put in a big hole. 

It made me so sorry I 
couldn’t stand it, and I cried, 
“Tell him you got his money 
under the seat in our car! 
Please, Gramp! Give it back 
to him." 

Nobody said anything, but 
everybody turned and looked 
at me. 

They stood real still. I saw 
in Cramp’s mind that I had 
been bad, bad. I ran to him 
and put my face in his coat 
and began to cry. I couldn’t 
help it. 

After a minute Gramp knelt 
on his good knee in front of 
me and took my cheeks in 
both his hands. 

“I’ve let you down. Chum," 
he said. He wasn’t mad any 
more. 

He picked me up in his 
arms. “You needed me, Little 
Joe," he said. “You needed 
me." His eyes were all 
smudgy. He squeezed me so 
hard I couldn’t breathe, al- 
most. 

Then he put me down and 
said, “Come on," to the two 
policemen. He walked away

the other IF 



DACK in 1944, after some 
^ tropical adventures, no 
writing for 2^ years, and full 
of ambitions for my re-entry 
into print in the soon-to-be- 
had postwar world, I invented 
a new magazine. In my na- 
ivete, I worked on the idea 
late at night when no one else 
was around and kept the ma- 
terial in a locked file when I 
went out, so sure I was that 
the idea, if it got into other 
hands, would instantly light 
up the sky while moneyed 
publishers tumbled over one 
another’s shoulders trying to 
force currency on the thief. 
The time came, however, when 
even I had to realize that one 
just doesn’t produce a maga- 
zine single-handed, perform- 
ing all functions unseen by 
others until it hits the stands; 
no, not even if one’s name is 
Leo Margulies. 

About this time I began to 
get letters from one Groff 
Conklin about, of all things, 
his desire to start a new maga- 
zine after the war was over. I 



had not yet met Groff (now 
one of my most valued 
friends) and I wish I had a 
multiflanged double-ended de- 
temporizer so I could travel 
back through time and see 
through his eyes what he 
thought of me and my wild 
idea, and at the same time re- 
capture my picture of him. All 
I can tell you for sure is that 
I must have seemed much 
more knowledgeable than I 
actually was, and he seemed 
as energetically warm and en- 
thusiastic as he actually is. 
And then, somewhere along 
the line, we got busy, he with 
his anthologies, I with my sto- 
ries. Maybe it was just the 
matter of a hundred thousand 
bucks or so for capital, which 
neither of us seemed to have 
at the time. But we did quite a 
bit of work on it. I designed 
a cover and had an artist 
friend render it for me. It was 
very stHking, somewhat along 
the lines of an old Unknoiyn 
typographical cover, with a 
background of hemorrhage 



107 





brown and lettering which, 
planned as crushed grape, 
came out as bruised broccoli. 
The two letters of the title, 
lower case and quite fat, start- 
ed in the upper left-hand cor- 
ner and their pedestals ran all 
the way to the bottom. 

We called it— IF. 

The years went by and oth- 
er things piled up, and the 
file of correspondence, the 
prospectus, the calculations 
and the cover dummy fell into 
a drawer somewhere (no long- 
er locked) and stayed there 
until one day I got a phone 
call from one Paul Fairman, 
a nice guy and a pretty fair 
country writer as well. He 
was starting a new magazine 
and he was calling it IF. All 
knowledgeable again, I had 
lunch with him and gave him 
a lot of good advice about how 
he couldn’t get any stories un- 
less he had money to pay for 
them and he couldn’t get that 
without a publisher, and it 
wasn’t the right time to start a 
magazine. I gave him the cov- 
er dummy as a booby prize 
and he thanked me for every- 
thing. He then went out and 
got money and backing and 
stories (one of them from me) 
and started the magazine. It 
has existed more or less con- 
stantly ever since. It has 
changed publishers and edi- 
tors and format; and just to 
complete the series of unlike- 
ly blows IF and I haye glanc- 
ingly struck one another dur- 
ing our careers, I now find 
myself one of its editors 

108 



while living ten miles away 
from where Mr. James Quinn 
used to publish it, and Larjy 
Shaw used to edit it. 

But for all its growth and 
change, IF has never become 
my IF — the other IF. I do not 
intend to make it so. There is, 
however, meat enough in its 
basic idea to afford you some 
pretty fascinating chewing. 
The moral, in case one is 
called for, would seem to be 
that your nova-burst of an in- 
spiration might serve, one 
day, to illuminate a few inner 
pages. Or maybe it’s aim for 
the stars, you’ll reach the 
treetops. 

T he other IF was to be a 
sort of science fiction 
magazine. But unlike any- 
thing else in the field, it was 
to be built around what, to me, 
was (and is) the most com- 
pelling single component of 
some science fiction — extra- 
polation, or what I like to call 
“gunsight vision. You line up 
something near at hand with 
something not quite so near, 
but real and reachable. Sight- 
ing the line between them, 
your vision is aligned by them 
to something r e m o t e — ^but 
clearly indicated. If I learn 
about a synchrotron, and then 
find out that the circular 
track can be straightened out 
to make a linear accelerator, 
I can by this knowledge clear- 
ly visualize a ray cannon or a 
space, drive on the same gen- 
eral principles. If I read about 
ground-effect cars, and then 



BY THEODORE STURGEON 




find out that someone has de- 
signed a hand-pushed utility 
car not powered, merely lifted 
by a small motor, I can visual- 
ize immensely long trains 
traveling over a highway built 
like a shallow ditch, pulled 
by a more or less conventional 
truck-tractor, with perhaps a 
wheeled caboose for braking. 

The principle works with 
people, too. One of the narra- 
tive knacks so generously giv- 
en me by Will Jenkins (Mur- 
ray Leinster) during those 
visits I mentioned in the last 
issue uses the same basic 
theory. To create plot from 
character, he told me, you 
take someone you know and 
understand and put him in a 
(for him) totally impossible 
situation. Then you let him 
work his way out of it by be- 
ing himself — by being uncon- 
querably, unswervingly and in 
all respects himself. His illus- 
tration was the yarn of a sea 
captain who after a storm 
found himself alone in the 
ocean with a bit of driftwood. 
What he was was a captain — 
which he couldn’t be because 
he had no ship. His way out 
(in typical Leinster ‘Vhat’s he 
doing that for?” prose) was to 
hold up his shirt on a stick to 
catch the wind for nine hours, 
then to drift quietly for two 
days, then to use the shirt 
again for six hours, where- 
upon he reached an island. 
Being what he was, he knew 
his exact position when he 
lost his ship, he knew the pre- 
vailing winds, he knew the 

Hie other IF 



currents in the area. The 
germane point here is that 
when he had no ship to com- 
mand, he became one. 

Another common example is 
the sweet little old lady thrust 
into the den of thieves, throw- 
ing them all into conniptions 
with her unchanging concern 
with tea-time and vespers. In 
short, take two mismatched 
knowns, extend the line be- 
tween them and they’ll point 
out a discovery, 

Now,*,if you want to extra- 
polate in more detail, and/or 
with more accuracy, the rifle- 
sights — two points — are not 
enough. Put just three points 
on a sheet of graph paper and 
join them, and you have a 
curve with certain character- 
istics. You can extend this, 
keeping the same characteris- 
tics, a distance beyond the 
third known point, with a rea- 
sonable assumption that when 
the fourth point is discovered 
it will lie in your curve. You 
can’t extend it too far, though, 
and still expect reasonable ac- 
curacy. But with five points — 
fifty — five hundred — the ex- 
act nature of your curve be- 
comes so apparent that you 
have to be right when you ex- 
tend it. You can write good 
sfc/ence- fiction this way — 
studying known science until 
you know it so well you can 
make a fair extrapolation. You 
can write good science-fiction 
by studying just as hard and 
then throwing a wild factor 
in somewhere up in the extra- 
polated area — ^precisely what 

109 




Asimov did in the Foundation 
series when he introduced The 
Mule into the millennia-long 
‘‘future history** drawn up by 
the psycho-historian Selden, 

N OW we’re getting close to 
the mainspring of the oth- 
er IF. Some years ago Jim 
Blish got so exercised by the 
alarming growth of the New 
York Port Authority, a local 
phenomenon which builds and 
operates tunnels, bridges and 
airports in the New York-New 
Jersey complex, that he sharp- 
ened up his typewriter and in 
seventy-some thousand words 
showed what would happen if 
this went on for two or three 
hundred years. Poul Anderson 
wrote two brilliant interplane- 
tary stories, one clearly about 
NATO, the other dealing with 
the Marshall Plan, These 
three stories, and L. Ron Hub- 
bard’s Final Blackout, are 
yarns I’d have taken for the 
other IF had there been one 
(and if other editors hadn’t 
gotten there first.) 

This kind of thing would 
have been the body of the 
magazine; but the departure, 
the scintillating Idea, was the 
one, or possibly two items in 
each issue under the general 
classification If this goes 
on. 

(That happens to be a Hein- 
lein title. I am not referring 
to his story. Just look at the 
words.) 

Now, every citizen makes 
this kind of extrapolation all 
the time. If the boss slams his 

110 



hat on the rack and doesn’t 
answer the receptionist’s 
“G’morning” you have evi- 
dence from ’way back what 
kind of morning it’s going to 
be. If your older brother has 
moaned his way through Al- 
gebra 3 with Miss G., well- 
known battle-axe, for a teach- 
er, you know pretty much 
what’s in store for you that 
fine September morn when 
you find yourself in her class. 
Or turn the thing around and 
get into the hindsight depart- 
ment. When Sue marries Joe 
instead of Sam, to your utter 
astonishment, and then you 
suddenly slap yourself on the 
head and say “of course! Re- 
member when they. .and that 
other time... and the thing 
that happened at the Christ- 
mas party ...” and it all 
abruptly makes sense ; well, 
say you had had the wit to 
notice and correctly interpret 
those things; you’d have been 
able to predict that marriage, 
wouldn’t you? 

To get printed in this spe- 
cial section of the other IF, 
then, you’d have to look about 
you and see what’s going on. 
You have to study it until you 
understand it. You’d have to 
wait, perhaps, until something 
new happened, giving you two 
points — the rifle-sights. And 
then study out more points, 
five, fifty, five hundred, until 
you felt able to extrapolate 
—oh, two days, a week, four 
years, ten. Then you’d write 
the piece and send it in, and 
if in four years or ten you 

BY THEODORE STURGEON 




proved to be dead wrong, it 
would be just because you 
didn’t plot enough points. 
(Unless there was a wild fac- 
tor ; and even those can be 
predicted sometimes. Your 
hindsight tells you so.) 

I dreamed such dreams 
about the other IF! It’d be on 
the stands a few months, see, 
and then I’d get this letter 
from a young government of- 
ficial suggesting it might be 
time for a conservative reviv- 
al, and ‘‘B. Goldwater” would 
go on the table of contents. A 
Mr. Willkie would write a 
reasoned conviction that we 
are one species and one world. 
A minor union official would 
predict that the auto workers 
would one day ask for a guar- 
anteed annual wage, and Reu- 
ther would go into the semi- 
annual. index. An obscure ref- 
ugee scientist named Wernher 
would write a piece with the 
laughable conclusion that the 
Russians would be first with 
a satellite. Finally, years later. 
Time would do a takeout on 
IF in the Press section, under 
the caption Newsstand Nos- 
tradamus or Pulp Prognosti- 
cator, with a cut of me holding 
up the table of contents of the 
June 1946 issue, with my fin- 
ger on the article, Why I Can't 
Lose in '48, by H. S. Truman. 
Wonderful, wonderful dreams 
And yet. ^ . 

A nd yet, wouldn’t it be 
wonderful to make a rea- 
soned prediction, see it in 
print three months Jater, and 

the other IF, 



have it coincide with that very 
day’s headlines? And what if 
you goof? I used to own a 1939 
Readers Digest bearing an ar- 
ticle about Why Japan Will 
Never Fight a War Against 
the U.S. I read an 1804 article 
(I suspect by a stockholder in 
a canal-boat firm) reasoning 
very plausibly that a locomo- 
tive could not pull a train be- 
cause only one mathematical 
point of each wheel was tan- 
gent to the track, and the cars 
(“carriages,” he said) would 
just be too heavy to start mov- 
ing. So what? You can take it. 

And I do mean you. I really 
do. 

I have not only a liking, but 
a profound respect for the 
kind of mind which reads sci- 
ence fiction. It’s a good mind. 
It recognizes no horizons. It 
is not afraid to go far out. 
And in many cases its ability 
to reason goes all the way 
from the awesome to the 
frightening. S-f has predicted 
a lot, has been wrong more of- 
ten than right, but has never, 
I do believe, really and truly 
tried to predict from the here 
and how to 90 days off. Are 
you game ? Do you want to try 
it? If you do, I’ll go along 
with you for two issues. Then 
we’ll skip one and take stock. 

The time element is perfect 
for this caper. It takes just 
about three months from the 
time you mail it for it to be 
printed and distributed. 
You’re reading this as spring 
starts to stir the turf. I write 
it in early December. Major

Glenn has not yet been 
launched. Governor Rockefel- 
ler, newly returned from the 
South Pacific, announces a 
shelter plan for everybody 
every place, over and above 
homes and schools. Swedish 
U.N. planes have just bombed 
a Katangese airport. Arc you 
oriented? 

Then let me establish a for- 
mat, and stick my own neck 
out. I want you to notice that 
these are not wild guesses; if 
you want to go a little deeper 
into your reasoning, by all 
means do so. 

PREDICTION ONE 

^Elizabeth Taylor*s Cleo- 
patra will he finished and re- 
leased, 

%Blondes will be '*out** bru- 
nettes **in,'* 

^Shoulder-length hair, with 
bangs, will be The Thing, 
%Necklines will do something 
they haven*t done publicly 
since Louis XIV, 

PREDICTION TWO 

%Many schools are over- 
crowded and operating on 
shifts because funds cannot be 
found for building additions, 
%School fallout shelters fre- 
quently cost more than build- 
ing additions, 

^Therefore by the time this 
appears there will have been 
news stories about at least 
seven violent protests by par- 
ent-taxpayers against the in- 
stallation of shelters in 

112 



schools which have not been 
able to build additions, 

PREDICTION THREE 

%Jack Paar has managed to 
be in several kinds of spectac- 
ular trouble. 

%He is due to leave the air in 
March, 

%He will do so in the midst 
of the most elaborate trouble 
he has yet managed. 

Get the idea? It would, of 
course, be preferable if your 
predictions were scientific or 
bore on s-f; mine come right 
off the top of my head, where 
the point is. All right : here 
are the ground rules: 

1. Deadline for the Septem- 
ber issue (due out in July): 
March 20. Deadline for the 
November issue (due out in 
September) : May 25. (That 
means I’ll be able to feature 
some of your best at the Chi- 
con : Pick-Congress Hotel, 
Chicago, Aug. 31 — Sept. 3.) 

2. No big prizes: this is for 
kicks. And for research: I 
know you are capable of ob- 
serving enough contributory 
details, of sensing the trend 
of events accurately enough, 
to come up with some truly 
startling results. (But just to 
make the game more interest- 
ing, we’ll reward some of the 
best guesses with free IF sub- 
scriptions.)

spondence except through 
these pages. END

It was just a little black box, 
useful for getting rid of things. 
Trouble was, it worked too well!

see my problem, 
, 1 Professor?’’ Tony Car- 
men held his pinkly mani- 
cured, flashily ringed hands 
wide. 

I saw his problem and it 
was warmly embarrassing. 

‘'Really, Mr. Carmen,” I 
said, “this isn’t the sort of 
thing you discuss, with a total 
stranger. I’m not a, doctor — 
not of medicine, , anyway — or 
a lawyer.” 

“They can’t help me. I need 
an operator in your line.” 

“I work for the United 
States government. I can’t be- 
come involved in anything 
illegal.” 

Carmen smoothed down the 
front of his too-tight mid- 
night blue suit and touched 
the diamond sticking in his 
silver tie. You can’t. Professor 
Venetti? Ever hear of the 
Mafia?” 

“I’ve heard of it,” I said 
uheasily. “An old fraternal 



organization something like 
the Moose or Rosicrucians, 
founded in Sicily. It alleged- 
ly controls organized crime in 
the U.S. But that is a respon- 
sibility-eluding myth that 
honest Italian-Americans are 
stamping out. We don’t even 
like to see the word in print.” 
“I can understand honest 
Italian-Americans feeling that 
way. But guys like me know 
the Mafia is still with it. We 
can put the squeeze on marks 
like you pretty easy.” 

You don’t have to tell even 
a third generation American 
about the Mafia. Maybe that 
was the trouble. I had heard 
too much and for too long. All 
the stories I had ever heard 
about the Mafia, true or false, 
built up an unendurable threat. 

“All tight, I’ll try to help 
you; Carmen. But... that is, 
you> didn’t kill any of these 
people?” 

He snorted. “I haven’t killed 

113 





anybody since early 1943.” 

. ‘'Please I said weakly. 
“You needn’t incriminate 
yourself with me.” 

“I was in the Marines,” 
Carmen said hotly. “Listen, 
Professor, these aren’t no Pro- 
hibition times. Not many peo- 
ple get made for a hit these 
days. Mother, most of these 
bodies they keep ditching at 
my club haven’t been mur- 
dered by anybody. They’re ac- 
cident victims. Rumbums with 
too much anti-freeze for a 
summer’s day, Spanish-Ameri- 
can War vets going to visit 
Teddy in the natural course of 
events. Harry Keno just stows 
them at my place to embarrass 
me. Figures to make me lose 
my liquor license or take a 
contempt before the Grand 
Jury.” 

“I don’t suppose you could 
just go to the police — ” I saw 
the answer in his eyes. “No. I 
don’t suppose you could.” 

“I told you once, Professor, 
but I’ll tell you again. I have 
to get rid of these bodies they 
keep leaving in my kitchen. I 
can take ’em and throw them 
in the river, sure. But what if 
me or my boys are stopped en 
route by some tipped badge?” 
“Quicklime?” I suggested 
automatically. 

“What are you talking 
about? Are you sure you’re 
some kind of scientist? Lime 
doesn’t do much to a stiff at 
all. Kind of putrifies them 
like. 

“I forgot,” I admitted. “I’d 
read it in so many stories I’d 



forgotten it wouldn’t work. 
And I suppose the furnace 
leaves ashes and there’s al- 
ways traces of hair and teeth 
in the garbage disposal. An 
interesting problem, at that.” 
“I figured you could handle 
it,” Carmen said, leaning back 
comfortably in the favorite 
chair of my bachelor apart- 
ment. “I heard you were work- 
ing on something to get rid of 
trash for the government.” 
“That,” I told him, “is re- 
stricted information. I sub- 
contracted that work from the 
big telephone laboratories. 
How did you find it out?” 
“Ways, Professor, ways.” 
The government did want 
me to find a way to dispose of 
wastes — radioactive wastes. It 
was the most important prob- 
lem any country could have in 
this time of growing atomic 
industry. Now a small-time 
gangster was asking me to use 
this research to help him dis- 
pose of hot corpses. It made 
my scientific blood seeth. But 
the shadow of the Black Hand 
cooled it off. 

“Maybe I can find some- 
thing in that area of research 
to help you,” I said. “I’ll call 
you.” 

“Don’t take too long. Pro- 
fessor,” Carmen said cordially. 

T he big drum topped with 
a metallic coolie’s hat had 
started out as a neutralizer for 
radioactivity. Now I didn’t 
know what to call it. 

The A EC had found bury- 
ing canisters of hot rubbish 



114 



BY JIM HARMON 




in the desert or in the Gulf 
had eventually proved unsat- 
isfactory. Earth tremors or 
changes of temperature split 
the tanks in the ground, caus- 
ing leaks. The undersea con- 
tainers rusted and corroded 
through the time, poisoning 
fish and fishermen. 

Through the SBA I had 
been awarded a subcontract to 
work on the problem. The 
ideal solution would be to find 
a way to neutralize radioactive 
emanations, alpha, beta, X et 
cetera. (No, my dear, et cetera 
rays aren’t any more danger- 
ous than the rest.) But this is 
easier written than done. 

Of course, getting energy to 
destroy energy without pro- 
ducing energy or matter is a 
violation of the maxim of the 
conservation of energy. But I 
didn’t let that stop me — any 
more than I would have let the 
velocity of light put any limi- 
tations on a spacecraft engine 
had I been engaged to work 
on one. You can’t allow other 
people’s ideas to tie you hand 
and foot. There are some who 
tell me, however, that my re- 
fusal to honor such time-test- 
ed cliches is why I only have 
a small private laboratory 
owned by myself, my late 
wife’s father and the bank, 
instead of working in the vast 
facilities of Bell, Du Pont, or 
General Motors. To this, I can 
only smile and nod. 

But even refusing to be 
balked by conservative ideas, 
I failed. 

I could not neutralize radio- 



activity. All I had been able 
to do (by a basic disturbance 
in the electromagnetogravita- 
tional co-ordinant system for 
Earth-Sun) was to reduce the 
mass of the radioactive matter. 

This only concentrated the 
radiations, as in boiling con- 
taminated water. It did make 
the hot stuff vaguely easier to 
handle, but it was no break- 
through on the central prob- 
lem. 

Now, in the middle of this, 
I was supposed to find a way 
to get rid of some damned 
bodies for Carmen. 

Pressed for time and know- 
ing the results wouldn’t have 
to be so precise or carefully 
defined for a racketeer as for 
the United States government, 
I began experimenting. 

I cut corners. 

I bypassed complete safety 
circuits. 

I put dangerous overloads 
on some transformers and 
doodled with the wiring dia- 
grams. If I got some kmd of 
passable incinerator I would 
be happy. 

T turned the machine on. 

The lights popped out. 

There were changes that 
should be made before I tried 
that again, but instead I only 
found a larger fuse for a 
heavier load and jammed that 
in the switchbox. 

I flipped my machine into 
service once again. The lights 
flickered and held. 

The dials on my control 
board told me the story. It 
was hard to take. 



THE EXPENDABLES

• But there it was. 

The internal scale showed 
z^rb. 

I had had a slightly hot bar 
of silver alloy inside. It was 
completely gone. Mass zero. 
The temperature gauge 
showed that there had been no 
charige in centigrade reading 
that ' couldn’t be explained by 
the mechanical operation of 
the machine itself. There had 
been no sudden discharge of 
electricity or radioactivity. 
I checked for a standard anti- 
gtavity effect but there was 
none. Gravity inside the cylin- 
der had gone to zero but never 
to minus. 

I was at last violating con- 
servation of energy — not by 
successfully inverting the 
cube of the ionization factor, 
but by destroying: mass. .by 
simply making it cease to ex- 
ist with no cause-and-effect 
side effects. 

I knew the government 
wouldn’t be interested, since 
I couldn’t explain how my de- 
vice worked. No amount of 
successful demonstration 
could ever convince anybody 
with any scientific training 
that it actually did work: 

But I shrewdly judged that 
Tony Carmen wouldn’t ask an 
embarrassing “how” when he 
was incapable of understand- 
ing the explanation. 

does it 

' Work?” Tony Carmen de- 
manded of me, sleeking his 
mifror-black hair and staring 
up at the disk-topped drum. 



“Why do you care?” I 
asked' irritably. “It will dis- 
pose of yoiir bodies for you.” 
“I got a reason that goes be- 
yond the stiff, but let’s stick 
to that just for now. Where 
are these bodies going? I don’t 
warit them winding up in the 
D.A.’s bathtub.” 

“Why not? How could they 
trace them back to you?” 
“You’re the scientist,” Tony 
said hotly. “I got great respect 
for those crime lab boys. May- 
be the stiff got some of my 
exclusive brand of talc on it, 
I don’t know.” 

’‘Listen here, Carmen,” I 
said, “what makes you think 
these bodies are going some- 
where? Think of it only as a 
kind of — incinerator.” 

“Not on your life. Professor. 
The gadget don’t get hot so 
how can it burn? It don’t use 
enough electricity to fry. It 
don’t cut ’em up or crush ’em 
down, or dissolve them in 
acid. I’ve seen disappearing 
cabinets before.” 

Mafia or not, I saw red. 
“Are you daring to suggest 
that I am working some trick 
with trap doors or sliding 
panels?” 

“Easy, Professor,” Carmen 
said, effortlessly shoving me 
back with one palm. “I’m not 
saying you have the machine 
rigged. It’s just that you have 
to be dropping the Stuff 
through a sliding panel in- 
well, everything around ' us. 
You’re sliding all thait aside 
and dropping things through. 
But I Want to know where

they wind up. Reasonable?” 
Carmen was an uneducated 
lout and a criminal but he had 
an instinctive feel for the 
mechanics of physics. 

“I don’t know where the 
stuff goes, Carmen,” I finally 
admitted. ”It might go into 
another plane of existence. 
'Another dimension’ the 
writers for the American 
Weekly would describe it. Or 
into our past, or our future.” 
The swarthy racketeer 
pursed his lips and apparently 
did some rapid calculation. 

”I don’t mind the first two, 
but I don’t like them going 
into the future. If they do 
that, they may show up again 
in six months.” 

”Or six million years.” 
''You’ll have to cut that fu- 
ture part out, Professor.” 

I was beginning to get a 
trifle impatient. All those folk 
tales I had heard about the 
Mafia were getting more dis- 
tant. "See here. Carmen, I 
could lie to you and say they 
went into the prehistoric past 
and you would never know the 
difference. But the truth is, I 
just don’t know where the 
processed material goes. 
There’s a chance it may go 
into the future, yes. But un- 
less it goes exactly one year 
or exactly so many years it 
would appear in empty space 
. because the earth will have 
moved from the spot it was 
transmitted. I don’t know for 
sure. Perhaps the slight De- 
neb-ward movement of the 
Solar System would wreck a 



perfect three-point landing 
even then and cause the dis- 
patched materials to burn ap 
from atmospheric friction, 
like meteors. You will just 
have to take a chance on the 
future. That’s the best I can 
do.” 

Carmen inhaled deeply, 
"Okay. I’ll risk it. Pretty long 
odds against any squeal on the 
play. How many of these 
things can you turn out, Pro- 
fessor?” 

"I can construct a duplicate 
of this device so that you may 
destroy the unwanted corpses 
that you would have me be- 
lieve are delivered to you with 
the regularity of the morning 
milk run.” 

The racketeer waved that 
suggestion aside. "I’m talking 
about a big operation, Venetti. 
These things can take the 
place of incinerators, garbage 
disposals, waste baskets...” 

"Impractical,” I snorted, 
"You don’t realize the tre- 
mendous amount of electrical 
power these devices re- 
quire. .” 

"Nuts! From what you said, 
the machine is like a TV set; 
it takes a lot of power to get 
it started, but then on it coasts 
on its own generators.” 

ii'^HERE’S something to 
A what you say,” I admit- 
ted in the face of his unex- 
pected information. "But I 
can hardly turn my invention 
over to your entirely persua- 
sive salesmen, I’m sure. This 
is part of the results of an

investigation for the govern- 
ment. Washington will have 
to decide what to do with the 
machine.’* 

‘‘Listen, Professor,” Carmen 
began, “the Mafia — ” 

“What makes you think I’m 
any more afraid of the Mafia 
than I am of the F.B.I.? I may 
have already sealed my fate 
by letting you in on this 
much. Machinegunning is 
hardly a less attractive fate to 
me than a poor security rat- 
ing. To me, being dead pro- 
fessionally would be as bad as 
being dead biologically.” 

Tony Carmen laid a heavy 
hand on my shoulder. I final- 
ly deduced he intended to be 
cordial. 

“Of course,” he said smooth- 
ly “you have to give this to 
Washington but there are 
ways, Professor. I know. I’m a 
business man — ” 

“You are?** I said. 

He named some of the busi- 
nesses in which he held large 
shares of stock. 

“You are.^' 

“I’ve had experience in this 
sort of thing. We simply leak 
the information to a few hun- 
dred well selected persons 
about all that your machine 
can do. We’ll call ’em Ex- 
pendables, because they can 
expend anything.” 

“I,” I interjected, “planned 
to call it the Venetti Ma- 
chine.” 

“Professor, who calls the 
radio the Marconi these 
days?” 

“There are Geiger-Muller 



Counters, though,” I said. 

“You don’t have to give a 
Geiger counter the sex appeal 
of a TV set or a hardtop con- 
vertible. We’ll call them Ex- 
pendables. No home will be 
complete v/ithout one.” 

“Perfect for disposing of 
unwanted bodies,” I mused. 
“The murder rate will go 
alarmingly with those devices 
within easy reach.” 

“Did that stop Sam Colt or 
Henry Ford?” Tony Carmen 
asked reasonably. 

Naturally, I was aware that 
the government would not be 
interested in my machine. I 
am not a Fortean, a' psychic, a 
psionicist or a screwball. But 
the government frequently 
gets things it doesn’t know 
what to do with — like air- 
planes in the ’twenties. When 
it doesn’t know what to do, it 
doesn’t do it. 

There have been hundreds 
of workable perpetual motion 
machines patented, for exam- 
ple. Of course, they weren’t 
vices in the strictest sense of 
the word. Many of them used 
the external power of gravity' 
they would wear out or slow 
down in time from friction, 
but for the meanwhile, for 
some ten to two hundred 
years they would just sit 
there, moving. No one had 
ever been able to figure 
out what to do with them. 

I knew the AEC wasn’t go- 
ing to dump tons of radioac- 
tive waste (with some possible 
future reclaimation value) 
into a machine which they 



118 



BY JIM HARMON 




didn’t believe actually could 
work. 

Tony Carmen knew exactly 
what to do with an Expend- 
able once he got his hands on 
it. 

Naturally, that was what I 
had been afraid of. 

T he closed sedan was warm, 
even in early December. 
Outside, the street was a 
progression of shadowed block 
forms. I was shivering slight- 
ly, my teeth rattling like the 
porcelain they were. Was this 
the storied ‘‘ride,” I won- 
dered? 

Carmen finally returned to 
the car, unlatched the door 
and slid in. He did not rein- 
sert the ignition key. I did not 
feel like sprinting down the 
deserted street. 

“The boys will have it set 
up in a minute,” Tony the 
racketeer informed me. 
“What?” The firing squad? 
“The Expendable, of 
course.” 

“Here? You dragged me out 
here to see how you have 
prostituted my invention? I 
presume you’ve set it up with 
a ‘Keep Our City Clean’ sign 
pasted on it.” 

He chuckled. It was a some- 
what nasty sound, or so I 
imagined. 

A flashlight winked in the 
sooty twilight. 

“Okay. Let’s go,” Tony 
said, slapping my shoulder. 

I got out of the car, rub- 
bing my flabby bicep. When- 
ever I took my teen-age 



daughter to the beach from 
my late wife’s parents’ home, 
I frequently found 230 pound 
bullies did kick sand in my 
ears. 

The machine was installed 
on the corner, half covered 
with a gloomy white shroud, 
and fearlessly plugged into 
the city lighting system via a 
blanketed streetlamp. Two 
hoods hovered in a doorway 
ready to take care of the first 
cop with a couple of fifties or 
a single .38, as necessity dic- 
tated. 

Tony guided my elbow. 
“Okay, Professor, I think I 
understand the bit now, but 
I’ll let you run it up with the 
flagpole for me, to see how it 
waves to the national anthem.” 

“Here?” I spluttered once 
more. “I told you, Carmen, I 
wanted nothing more to do 
with you. Your check is still 
on deposit. ” 

“You didn’t want anything 
to do with me in the first 
place.” The thug’s teeth 
flashed in the night. “Throw 
your contraption into gear, 
buddy.” 

That was the first time the 
tone of respect, even if faked, 
had^ gone out of his voice. I 
moved to the switchboard of 
my invention. What remained 
was as simple as adjusting a 
modern floor lamp to a me- 
dium light position. I flipped. 

Restraining any impulse to- 
' ward colloqualism, I was also 
deeply disturbed by what next 
occurred. 

One of the massive square 



THE EXPENDABLES 



119 




shapes on the horizon van- 
ished. 

“What have you done?” I 
yelped, ripping the cover off 
the machine. 

Even under the uncertain il- 
lumination of the smogged 
stars I could see that the unit 
was half gone — in fact, exact- 
ly halved. 

“Squint the Seal is one of 
my boys. He used to be a me- 
chanic in the old days for 
Burger, Madle, the guys who 
used to rob banks and stuff.” 
There was an unmistakable 
note of boyish admiration in 
Carmen’s voice. “He figured 
the thing would work like 
that. Separate the poles and 
you increase the size of the 
working area.” 

“You mean square the oper- 
ational field. Your idiot 
doesn’t even know mechanics.” 

“No, but he knows all about 
how any kind of machine 
works.” 

“You call that working?” I 
demanded. “Do you realize 
what you have there, Car- 
men?” 

“Sure. A disintegrator ray, 
straight out of Startling Sto- 
ries/* 

My opinion as to the type 
of person who followed the 
pages of science-fiction mag- 
azines with fluttering lips and 
tracing finger was upheld. 

I looked at the old ware- 
house and of course didn’t see 
it. 

“What was this a test for?” 
I asked, fearful of the Frank- 
enstein I had made. “What 



are you planning to do now?” 
“This was no test, Vcnetti. 
This was it. I just wiped out 
Harry Keno and his intimates 
right in the middle of their 
confidential squat.” 

“Good heavens. That’s un- 
couthly old-fashioned of you. 
Carmen ! Why, that’s mur- 
der/* 

“Not,” Carmen said, “with- 
out no corpus delecti/* 

“The body of the crime re- 
mains without the body of the 
victim,” I remembered from 
my early Ellery Queen train- 
ing. 

“You’re talking too much. 
Professor,” Tony suggested. 
“Remember, you did it with 
your machine.” 

“Yes,” I said at length. 
“And why are we standing 
here lettmg those machines 
sit there?” 

T here were two small items 
of interest to me in the 
Times the following morning. 

One two-inch story — ^barely 
making page one because of a 
hole to fill at the bottom of an 
account of the number of vic- 
tims of Indian summer heat 
prostration — told of the incin- 
eration of a warehouse on 
Fleet Street by an ingenious 
new arson bomb that left “vir- 
tually” no trace. (Maybe the 
fire inspector had planted a 
few traces to make his expla- 
nation more creditable.) 

The second item was fur- 
ther over in a science column 
just off the editorial page. It 
told of the government — !—

developing a new process of 
waste disposal rivaling the old 
-Buck Rogers disintegrator 
ray. 

This, I presumed, was one 
of Tony Carmen’s information 
leaks. 

If he hoped to arouse the 
public into demanding my in- 
vention I doubted he would 
succeed. The public had been 
told repeatedly of a new ra- 
dioactive process for preserv- 
ing food and a painless way 
of spraying injections through 
the skin. But they were still 
stuck with refrigerators and 
hypodermic needles. 

I had forced my way half- 
way through the paper and the 
terrible coffee I made when 
the doorbell rang. 

I was hardly surprised when 
it turned out to be Tony Car- 
men behind the front door. 

He pushed in, slapping a 
rolled newspaper in his palm. 
‘‘Action, Professor.” 

“The district attorney has 
indicted you?” I asked hope- 
fully. 

“He’s not even indicted you, 
Venetti. No, I got a feeler on 
this plant in the Times/* 

I shook my head. “The gov- 
ernment will take over the in- 
vention, no matter what the 
public wants.” 

“The public? Who cares 
about the public? The Arci- 
vox corporation wants this 
machine of yours. They have 
their agents tracing the plant 
now. They will go from the 
columnist to his legman to my 
man and finally to you; Won’t 

THE EXPENDABLES 



be long before they get here. 
An hour maybe.^ 

“Arcivox makes radios and 
TV sets. What do they want 
with the Expendables?” 
“Opening up a new appli- 
ance line with real innova- 
tions. I hear they got a new 
refrigerator. All open. Just 
shelves — no doors or sides. 
They want a revolutionary 
garbage disposal too.” 

“Do you own stock in the 
company? Is that how you 
know?” 

“I own stock in a competi- 
tor. That’s how I know,” Car- 
men informed me. “Listen, 
Professor, you can sell to 
Arcivox and still keep control 
6f the patents through a sep- 
arate corporation. And I’ll 
give you 49% of its stock.” 
This was Carmen’s idea of 
a magnanimous offer for my 
invention. It was a pretty 
good offer — 49% and my good 
health. 

“But will the government 
let Arcivox have the machine 
for commercial use?” 

“The government would let 
Arcivox have the hydrogen 
bomb if they found a commer- 
cial use for it.” 

There was a sturdy knock 
on the door, not a shrill ring 
of the bell. 

“That must be Arcivox 
now,” Carmen growled. “They 
have the best detectives in the 
business. You know what to 
tell them?” 

I knew what to tell them. 



121 




I peeled off my wet shirt and 
threw it across the corner of 
my desk, casting a reproving 
eye at the pastel air-condition- 
er in the window. It wasn't 
really the machine's fault — 
The water department report- 
ed the reservoir too low to 
run water-cooled systems. It 
would be a day or two before I 
could get the gas type into my 
office. 

Miss Brown, my secretary, 
was getting a good look at my 
pale, bony chest. Well, for the 
salary she got, she could stand 
to look. Of course, she herself 
was wearing a modest one- 
strap sun dress, not shorts and 
halters like some of the girls. 

“My," she observed “it cer- 
tainly is humid for March, 
isn’t it. Professor Venetti?" 

I agreed that it was. 

She got her pad and pencil 
ready. 

“Wheedling form letter to 
Better Mousetraps. Where are 
our royalties for the last quar- 
ter of the year? We know we 
didn’t have a full three 
months with our Expendable 
Field in operation on the new 
traps, but we want the payola 
for what we have coming. 

“Condescending form letter 
to Humane Lethal Equipment. 
Absolutely do not send the 
California penal system any 
chambers equipped with our 
patented field until legisla- 
ture officially approves them. 
We got away with it in New 
Mexico, but we're older and 
wiser now. 

“Rush priority telegram to 



President, United States, kny 
time in the next ten days. 
Thanks for citation, et cetera. 
Glad buddy system working 
out well ir^ training battlefield 
disintegrator teams. 

“Indignant form letter to 
Arcivox. We do not feel we 
are properly a co-respondent 
in your damage suits. Small 
children and appliances have 
always been a problem, viz ice 
boxes and refrigerators. Sug- 
gest you put a more compli- 
cated latch on the handles of 
the dangerously inferior doors 
you have covering our effi- 
cient, patented field.” 

I leaned back and took a 
breather. There was no get- 
ting around it — I just wasn’t 
happy as a business man. I had 
been counting on being only a 
figurehead in the Expendable 
Patent Holding Corporation, 
but Tony Carmen didn't like 
office work. And he hadn't 
anyone he trusted any more 
than me. Even. 

I jerked open a drawer and 
pulled off a paper towel from 
the roll I had stolen in the 
men's room. Scrubbing mv 
chest and neck with it, I 
smoothed it out and dropped 
it into the wastebasket. It slid 
down the tapering sides and 
through the narrow slot above 
the Expendable Field. I had 
redesigned the wastebaskets 
after a janitor had stepped in 
one. But Gimpy was happy 
now, with the $50,000 we paid 
him. 

I opened my mouth and

up its eraser, reflecting her 
fierce alertness* 

Tony Carmen banged open 
the door, and I closed my 
mouth. 

“G-men on the way here,” he 
blurted and collapsed into a 
chair opposite Miss Brown. 

“Don’t revert to type,” I 
warned him. “What kind of 
G-Men? FBI? FCC? CIA? 
FDA? USTD?” 
“Investigators for the 
Atomic Energy Commission.” 
The solemn, conservatively 
dressed young man in the door 
touched the edge of his snap- 
brim hat as he said it. 

“Miss Brown, would you 
mind letting our visitor use 
your chair?” I asked. 

“Not at all, sir,” she said 
dreamily. 

“May I suggest,” I said 
“that we might get more busi- 
ness done if you then removed 
yourself from the chair first.” 
Miss Brown leaped to her 
feet with a healthy galvanic 
response and quit the vicinity 
with her usual efficiency. 

O NCE seated, the AEC man 
said “I’ll get right to the 
point. You may find this trou- 
blesome, gentlemen, but your 
government intends to comfis- 
cate all of the devices using 
your so-c ailed Expendable 
field, and forever bar their 
manufacture in this country or 
their importation.'' 

“You stinking G-men aren’t 
getting away with this," Car- 
men said ingratiatingly, “Ever 
heat of the Mafia?" 



“Not much,” the young man 
admitted earnestly, “since the 
FBI finished with its deporta- 
tions a few years back.” 

I cleared my throat. “I must 
admit that the destruction of a 
multi-billion business is dis- 
concerting before lunch. May 
we ask why you took this 
step?” 

The agent inserted a finger 
between his collar and tie. 
“Have you noticed how unsea- 
sonably warm it is?” 

“I wondered if you had. 
You’re going to have heat 
prostration if you keep that 
suit coat on five minutes 
more.” 

The young man collapsed 
back in his chair, loosening 
the top button of his ivy 
league jacket, looking from 
my naked hide to the gos- 
somer scrap of sport shirt 
Carmen wore. “We have to 
dress inconspicuously in the 
service,” he panted weakly. 

I nodded understandingly. 
“What does the heat have to 
do with the outlawing of the 
Expendables?” 

“At first we thought there 
might be some truth in the 
folk nonsense that nuclear 
tests had something to do with 
raising the mean temperature 
of the world,” the AEC man 
said. “But our scientists 
quickly found they weren’t to 
blame.” 

“Clever of them." 

“Yes, they saw that the 
widespread use of your ma- 
chines was responsible for the 
higher temperature. Your de- 



THE EXPENDABLES 



123 




vice violates the law of con- 
servation of energy, seeming- 
ly. It seemingly destroys mat- 
ter without creating energy. 
Actually — 

He paused dramatically, 

“Actually, your device add- 
ed the energy it created in 
destroying matter to the en- 
ergy potential of the planet in 
the form of heat. You see 
what that means? If your de- 
vices continue in operation, 
the mean temperature of 
Earth will rise to the point 
where we burst into flame. 
They must be outlawed!” 

“I agree,” I said reluctantly. 

Tony Carmen spoke up. 
“No, you don’t. Professor. 
We don’t agree to that.” 

I waved his protests aside. 

“I would agree,” I said, “ex- 
cept that it wouldn’t work. 
Explain the danger to the pub- 
lic, let them feel the heat rise 
themselves, and they will 
hoard Expendables against 
seizure and continue to use 
them, until we do burst into 
flame, as you put it so re- 
ligiously.” 

“Why?” the young man de- 
manded. 

“Because Expendables are 
convenient. There is a ban on 
frivolous use of water due to 
the dire need. But the police 
still have to go stop people 
from watering lawns, and I 
suspect not a few swimming 
pools are being filled on the 
sly. Water is somebody else’s 
worry. So will be generating 
enough heat to turn Eden into 
Hell.” 



“Mass psychology isn’t my 
strongest point,” the young 
man said worriedly. “But I 
suspect you may be right. 
Then — we’ll be damned?” , , 

“No, not necessarily,” I told 
him comfortingly. “All we 
have to do is use up the excess 
energy with engines of a spe- 
cific design.” 

“But can we design those 
engines in time?” the young 
man wondered with uncharac- 
teristic gloom. 

“Certainly,” I said, practis- 
ing the power of positive 
thinking. “Now that your 
world-wide testing laborato- 
ries have confirmed a vague 
fear of mine, I can easily re- 
verse the field of the Expend- 
able device and create a rather 
low-efficiency engine that 
consumes the excess energy in 
our planetary potential.” 

'^HE agent of the AEC 
^ whose name I can never 
remember was present along 
with Tony Carmen the night 
my assistants finished with 
the work I had outlined. 

While it was midnight out- 
side, the fluorescents made 
the scene more visible than 
sunlight. My Disexpendable 
was a medium-sized drum in 
a tripod frame with an un- 
turned coolie’s hat at the bot- 
tom. 

Breathlessly, I closed the 
switch and the scooped disc 
began slowly to revolve. 

“Is it my imagination,”, the 
agent asked, “or is it getting 
cooler in here?”

^Professor.’* Carmen gave 
me a warning nudge* 

There was now something 
on the revolving disc. It was a 
bar of some shiny gray metal. 

‘‘Kill the power, Professor/* 
Carmen said. 

‘'Can it be,** I wondered, 
**that the machine is somehow 
recreating or drawing back 
the processed material from 
some other time or dimen- 
sion?” 

“Shut the thing off, Venet- 
ti r’ the racketeer demanded. 

But too late. 

There was now a somewhat 
dead man sitting in the saddle 
of the turning circle of metal. 

If Harry Keno had only 
been sane when he turned up 
on that merry-go-round in 
Boston I feel we would have 
learned much of immense val- 
ue on the nature of time and 
space. 

As it is, I feel that it is a 
miscarriage of justice to hold 
me in connection with the 
murders I am sure Tony Car- 
men did commit. 

I hope this personal account 



when published will end the 
vicious story supported by the 
district attorney that it was I 
who sought Tony Carmen out 
and offered to dispose of his 
enemies and that I sought his 
financial backing for the ex- 
ploitation of my invention. 

This is the true, and only 
true, account of the develop- 
ment of the machine known as 
the Expendable. 

I am only sorry, now that 
the temperature has been 
standardized once more, that 
the Expendable’s antithesis, 
the Disexpendable, is of too 
low an order of efficiency to 
be of much value as a power 
source in these days of. nu- 
clear and solar energy. So the 
world is again stuck with the 
problem of waste disposal... 
including all that I dumped 
before. But as a great Ameri- 
can once said, you can’t win 
’em all. 

If you so desire, you may 
send your generous and fruit- 
ful letters towards my upcom- 
ing defense in care of this 
civic-minded publication.

IF of March, 1962, Happy 
Homicide, p. 82, records the 
fallacy (such even in a futur- 
istic setup) that brain tissue, 
dead longer than five minutes, 
still contains mind vibrations 
traceable by a super-dooper 
encephalogram. If brain and 
mind be identical, then violin 
and violinist are interchange- 
able as well. Even fiddler Al- 
bert Einstein thought so, leav- 
ing his erstwhile brain to sci- 
ence. Did the microtome lo- 
cate his genius? General tenor 
of IF ingenious, plausible, 
well edited, facetious fiddle- 
sticks at minimum, genuine 
merit. Candid editorial excel- 
lent. Four-dimensional wis- 
dom unknowable to us 3-di- 
mensional clucks. Will convey 
info if anything fulminant 
crosses my horizon. Psionics 
inconstant undeveloped toy. 
All the best to you, yours, etc.

Dear Editors — ^whoever you 
are: 

It*s been many years (more 
than I care to remember) since 
I sat down last and hacked out 
a letter to a pro-editor. Even 
so, I was surprised to see Ken 
Winkes’s letter in your Janu- 
ary issue; I have always been 
under the impression that a 
letter column was supposed to 

HUE AND CRY 



be for just the purpose that 
he suggests — discussion, argu- 
ment, (you should forgive the 
expression) hue and cry. Or 
have letter columns changed 
that much in the last ten 
years ? 

I wonder if Ken Winkes re- 
members the letter columns of 
the old Thrilling Wonder Sto- 
ries, Startling Stories (under 
Sam Merwin and Sam Mines) 
and Planet Stories (under 
Robert Lowndes). I suppose 
all of us in those days had, to 
a certain degree, the so-called 
“sense of wonder.'^ But such 
letter columns — eight, ten 
pages long — those were the 
days when professional au- 
thors were regular contribu- 
tors, and the discussion 
ranged from new findings of 
Sumerian artifacts in the Ira- 
nian desert to the latest devel- 
opments in rocket fuels. Now, 
the Sumerian artifacts have 
withdrawn to the museums 
and the artificial satellites are 
circling the Earth by the doz- 
en."^ometimes I think the guy 
was right who said that famil- 
iarity breeds contempt. 

Of course the inevitable 
happened. Between rising 
costs of magazine publishing 
and waning interest on the 
part of the letter writers, the 
forum-type letter column was 
doomed to extinction; and in 
my mind at least, now occu- 
pies the same portion of the 
imagination usually reserved 
for particularly idyllic mem- 
ories. 

Since Ken asks, suppose we

try a definition of this term 
‘‘sense of wonder” (even 
though it's rather like trying 
to define “time.”) My diction- 
ary defines “wonder” as: 

, .thing or event that causes 
astonishment and admiration 
...feeling of surprise. .and 
awe aroused by something 
strange. unexpected, incred- 
ible ; to have doubt mingled 
with curiosity.” And: “Sense; 
the ability of the nerves and 
brain to receive and react to 
stimuli.” 

‘"Sense of wonder: The 

brain reaction to a set of 
stimuli which inspire awe, 
astonishment, admiration, sur- 
prise; to be inspired by these 
stimuli to doubt (no doubt 
mixed with curiosity) ; aston- 
ishment and unexpected in- 
credulity; the whole thing be- 
ing a function of a vivid 
imagination.” 

It's a tenuous thing, this 
“sense of wonder.” To have 
one, you must have imagina- 
tion. In fact, a sense of won- 
der and imagination are two 
hairs of the same dog — you 
might say, two sides of the 
same hair. It is not something 
limited to a reading and ap- 
preciation of science fiction. 
Imagination opens the lock on 
any door, shows the way to 
the solving of any problem. It 
is just that, to many people, 
science fiction is a whole new 
set of doors. Before 1957, one 
of these doors opened to the 
regions of near space. Now 
that sputniks and satellites 
are shooting about all over up 



there, the frontier has all but 
vanished. It is “explored” ter- 
ritory. Near space has attained 
the status of the “Old West” 
during the early years of this 
century — almost all explored, 
filled with dust, weather and 
hundreds of people just trying 
to live there, never mind how 
wonderful it is. 

Someone said not too long 
ago that once men have gone 
to the moon there will be an- 
other frontier gone — after all, 
what enjoyment is there in 
reading a story about a trip 
across country in a car? Many 
stories were written about 
that very thing, years ago. 
Now cross-country trips are a 
matter of course. 

Imagination — the “sense of 
wonder” — hasn't vanished and 
it never will. But with each 
stride forward of science, a 
portion of what was once alive 
only in the imagination be- 
comes hard living fact. You 
don't have to use your imagi- 
nation to deal with it... at 
least with the basic parts of it. 

But for every problem 
solved there are a hundred 
new ones. It is impossible for 
Man to become bored with 
evervthing — at least, not for a 
few hundred thousand years.

ed many a magazine, but Plan- 
et Stories wasn't one of them. 
Mai Reiss, Jerry Bixby, Paul 
Fairman, Scott Peacock were 
a few of Planet*s eminent 
helmsmen. 

But with the rest of what 
yoii say we agree ! Science fic- 
tion doesn't suffer because 
science moves along. There 
are always new frontiers — aU 
ways new discoveries — always 
new things to look at through 
the illuminating mirror that 
our writers hold up for us.

Dear Mr. Sturgeon: 

I send this along to you for 
several reasons. 1 : Readers 
seldom influence the format 
of publishing policy of a mag- 
azine — only its life or death. 
2 : As a feature editor you can 
think about and discuss many 
things an editor must reject. 

Over Labor Day I attended 
the Sci-Fic Convention here 
in Seattle. I was pleased with 
the convention — -but the one 
factor that disturbed me was 
the percentage of middle-age 
and past m i d d 1 e-aged to 
youth. Lots of young people — 
to be sure — but not nearly 
enough. 

Again, the high per cent of 
the youth that fell into the 
“screwball” or “fad” division. 
Fads are soon dropped as peo- 
ple mature. Will they drop s.f. 
as well? I think so. 

I have been working for. 
Boeing Airplane Company the 
past couple of years, and I 

HUE AND CRY 



have been working on advance 
planning on Dyna-Soar III. 
Wandering about in 1966 and 
doing niuch of what I used to 
dream of doing when I was in 
high school and finally got 
the training to do. The thing 
I have noted (has been noted 
elsewhere) is the lack of in- 
terest among our younger 
employees in the actual pro- 
ject — aside from pay day. 

What is the problem? Well, 
I think it has been the loss of 
“bridge material” in s.f. The 
loss of space opera has been 
lauded in some areas — but kids 
that have been raised on Matt 
Dillon and “The Untouch- 
ables” have a tough time 
transferring their interest to 
the advanced pages of Analog 
or Galaxy. IF does pop up 
with some but — only once in a 
while. 

Let them find their way to 
the advanced social and tech- 
nical S-F through plain old 
space opera!

* 1: We v/ere at Seattle too, 

and noticed the lack of young- 
er fans, relatively speaking. 
Heard a very logical explana- 
tion, though. Seattle being 
very far from usual fannish 
hangouts, only the more sol- 
vent — which is generally to 
say, the older — fans could 
scrape up the carfare. 2: IF 
tries real hard to bring good 
‘*space opera” to its readers. 
We like it too. The hard part 
is convincing the writers to 
write it for us. 3: A boon, f el-

lows! Please don’t address 
your letters to Our Bearded 
Feature Editor, or the art di- 
rector, or the publisher. This 
involves us either in forward- 
ing mail back and forth — 
which takes time and lets 
some of it get lost, we fear — 
or in opening Our Bearded 
Feature Editor’s personal mail 
from old loves, ardent fans 
and long-lost relatives — which 
involves us in angry re- 
proaches. Just: “Hue & Cry, 
c/o IF” will do fine. At great 
expense to ourselves we em- 
ploy a large secretarial staff — 
or anyway, a staff composed 
of 1 large secretary — to sort 
things out. Trust her! 

— Editor, 

Dear Editor: 

Okay, okay, you’ve put the 
“Worlds of” back in the title 
were it belonged, but how do 
you Fead it now? “IF — 
Worlds of Science Fiction” or 
“Worlds of IF — Science Fic- 
tion”? The former is the origi- 
nal title and by far the best 
one. Will be eagerly awaiting 
your answer, since I bind my 
copies by myself and don’t 
know which of the titles to 
put on the spine of the maga- 
zine. 

Congrats on the new cover 
and spine logos ; they look 
much better in the bookcase. 
But what’s the big idea, using 
just one metallic clip, or what- 

er you call it? Does this 
really cut costs, or is this just 
plain avarice? 

There used to be occasional 



(and very good too, I might 
add) anthologies, of which the 
last one was The Second 
World of If. Why couldn’t 
you continue the series? I’m 
sure the readers would receive 
them back enthusiastically. 
Also, why not have Ted Stur- 
geon review some books each 
issue? A book review feature 
is very necessary to a maga- 
zine. And, while you’re at it, 
get somebody to write science 
articles, eight to ten pages 
long, not those skimpy news 
items Sturgeon is forced to 
do; Scientific American does 
them much better. By the way, 
I am also entirely in favor of 
a 3-4 page editorial and some 
6 pages of letters. Come now, 
it isn’t very much, is it? 

Alexander Yudenitch 

San Paulo, Brazil 
* Re avarice: We’re trying 
to do something about that 
now, though it pains our 
greedy soul to part with the 
price of an extra staple. 
(That’s a joke. The problem is 
actually more complicated — 
but we are working on it.) Re 
“Science News Briefs”: Okay, 
we’ve killed them. Like this 
month’s Sturgeon science ar- 
ticle better? Re anthologies: 
We're working on that, too. 
Let you know more about it 
soon. — Editor. 

By the way, you letter-writ- 
ers — take a look at The Other 
IF in this issue before you sit 
down to a typewriter again. 
Might give you something 
fresh to think about! END
