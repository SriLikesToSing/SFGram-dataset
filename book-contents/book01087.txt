THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the bid- 
den processes of man's mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH? 



T ET’s think about education for 
a while. How much do we 
need? And what do we need it 
for? 

By the age of thirteen or four- 
teen a child is supposed to have 
learned a few simple arts and 
skills — the rudiments of geogra- 
phy, as much simple arithmetic as 
he will ever need and a beginning 
in algebra; English, grammar and 
spelling sufficient to write a let- 
ter or read a mass-circulation 
magazine; and a smattering of 
other odds and ends. 

At eighteen, leaving high 
school, he will have added a half- 
baked acquaintance with the less 
useful forms of another language; 
and a few excursions into geom- 
etry and intermediate algebra. He 
will perform experiments involv- 
ing most of the simpler discover- 
ies of 19th century science. He 
will have tasted the less contro- 
versial delights of literature, and 
memorized enough historical 
dates to understand, at least, what 
the major holidays commemorate. 

Four college years later, his 
bachelor’s degree in his hand, he 
will be presumed to have “com- 
pleted” his education ... in every 
respect save one. 



If he is to be a chemist, he 
will have learned as much about 
French essays as he will ever be 
required to know. 

If he is to be a teacher of social 
studies, he will have completed 
his learning of mathematics. 

He will, in short, have learned 
all he needs to know — about 
every subject about which he 
really needs to know nothing. It 
is in the next two, four or ten 
years — whether in school or serv- 
ing his apprenticeship outside of 
school — that he will at last learn 
his own work. 

It is in this “post graduate” 
period that the chemist learns 
chemistry and the social studies 
teacher learns what the Lynds 
were up to when they wrote Mid- 
dletown. 

In any branch of learning, then, 
in which a body of knowledge al- 
ready exists, the practitioner is in 
his thirties before he really knows 
what can be taught him. And 
what can be “taught”? He knows 
what Michelson did in 1887. But 
he doesn’t know what Fred Hoyle 
is doing in 1961. He knows what 
Galileo deduced about gravita- 
tion and mass in 1591, but he 
doesn’t know what some isolated 



5 



worker has just learned this week. 
Only dead knowledge is en- 
tombed in texts. For what is going 
on now, where the work is to be 
done, only day-by-day continuing 
study can keep a man abreast of 
his own field. 

TT is a two-headed problem, you 
see. 

Head one: Too much time is 
spent learning what isn’t needed. 
(Not needed the job, anyway. 
Naturally the more everyone 
knows about everything, the more 
understanding we’ll have in the 
world. The question is really how 
much of a price we are willing to 
pay to have a “well-rounded” pop- 
ulation.) 

Head two: There is too much 
information in every area for any 
one person to digest. 

There is a solution at least to 
the problem propounded by the 
second head. Algis Budrys once 
wrote a story in which people 
kept their memories in little com- 
puter-storage boxes which they 
carried around with them. Want 
to know Uncle Charlie’s birthday? 
Plug in the appropriate area of 
the little black box, and the stored 
information comes promptly to 
mind. 

Well, the story is fiction, of 
course. We don’t have any such 
little black box on the market. 

Do we? 

What Budrys was suggesting 



was an idea, not a box. Maybe, af- 
ter all, we’re not so far from the 
idea. Data is now being made 
available in highly compressed 
form. 10,000 pages of French 
atomic-energy data is to be had 
by anyone with the price in the 
form of a batch of microcards not 
much larger than a canasta deck. 
They can be flicked out by sorters 
without much difficulty by simple 
edge-coding. You don’t read 
French? No problem. Machine 
translation of foreign languages is 
already a practical reality. (An 
awkward, unpolished, idiosyncra- 
tic reality — “Le chat est noir” is 
likely to come out “The/this cat- 
masculine (is?) black/blackly” — 
but a reality all the same.) 

It is a question of accessibility. 
The most accessible place for in- 
formation is right in the front of 
your own brain — “at the tip of 
your fingers,” as we say — but 
surely an acceptable second-best 
would be to have it really “at the 
tips of your fingers” — i.e., at the 
other end of a computerized tele- 
type setup. 

It would be a pretty big box to 
carry around, but it can be built: 
A computer, linked with sufficient 
storage capacity (which doesn’t 
have to be in one place; Interna- 
tional Tel & Tel will gladly give 
you a circuit from almost any- 
where to almost everywhere), so 
that the man working on the 
angular momentum of galaxies in 



6 



GALAXY 



Pasadena can get the latest spec- 
troscopic data from France, Eng- 
land, Australia and Capetown 
simply by pushing the combina- 
tion of buttons that translates as: 
“Galaxies, spectroscopic, internal 
Doppler shifts of.” 

A ND what about the other head 
of the problem? What about 
the task of merely acquiring a 
basis of embalmed knowledge — 
i.e., “education?” 

There’s no doubt, as we said, 
that knowledge is a desideratum. 
But there are kinds and kinds of 
knowledge. It isn’t going to help 
a layman (won’t for that matter 
even help a mathematician par- 
ticularly!) to know that the six 
millionth prime number is 104,- 
395,289. Surely it is enough for 
him to know a few simple rules: 
that the distribution of primes is 
such that in the first hundred mil- 
lion integers about one out of 
twenty is a prime; or to know, if a 
number like 104,395,281 comes 
up, that it is not a prime. (All he 
has to know is the simple rule 
that if the sum of the digits in a 
number is divisible by three, the 
number itself is divisible by three, 
and thus by definition not a 
prime.) 

By the same token, it isn’t par- 
ticularly important to memorize 
the date of the Battle of New Or- 
leans or the signing of the Eman- 
cipation Proclamation. The se- 



quence of events surrounding 
each of these occasions may be 
worth remembering: for New Or- 
leans, because it occurred after 
the War of 1812, of which it was 
a part, was actually over (the 
Treaty of Ghent had been signed, 
but the combatants didn’t know 
about it); for the Emancipation 
Proclamation, because its timing 
offers an interesting and useful 
glimpse into the thinking of one 
of our greatest presidents (it 
waited on the Union victory at 
Antietam, because Lincoln, a mas- 
ter politician, held it up until a 
Northern victory would give it 
extra meaning.) 

Actually, a good answer to 
most school test questions would 
be: “I can look it up for you, if 
you want me to.” Unfortunately, 
that’s not a passing answer! 

But perhaps it isn’t the answer 
that’s wrong; perhaps it’s the sys- 
tem of examining on details in- 
stead of on understanding. 

What’s the answer to the prob- 
lem of education? Well, it’s not 
the business of a science-fiction 
magazine to say. We supply ques- 
tions, not answers. Hugo Gerns- 
back says that that’s the hard 
part of the creative process: It’s 
easy to work out the answers, 
once the questions are known. 

Well, let’s work on these for a 
while!

pitied him?

HERE was a tremendous 



difference between the 



liner and the ferry in 
Mercer’s treatment. On the liner, 
the attendants made gibes when 
they brought him his food. 

“Scream good and loud,” said 
one rat-faced steward, “and then 
we’ll know it’s you when they 
broadcast the sounds of punish- 
ment on the Emperor’s birth- 
day.” 

The other, fat steward ran the 
tip of his wet red tongue over 
his thick purple-red lips one 
time and said, “Stands to reason, 
man. If you hurt all the time, 
the whole lot of you would die. 
Something pretty good must 
happen, along with the — what- 
chamacallit. Maybe you turn in-

to a woman. Maybe you turn 
into two people. Listen, cousin, 
if it’s real crazy fun, let me 
know. .” Mercer said nothing. 
Mercer had enough troubles of 
his own not to wonder about the 
daydreams of nasty men. 

At the ferry it was different. 
The biopharmaceutical staff was 
deft, impersonal, quick in remov- 
ing his shackles. They took off 
all his prison clothes and left 
them on the liner. When he 
boarded the ferry, naked, they 
looked him over as if he were 
a rare plant or a body on the 
operating table. They were al- 
most kind in the clinical deftness 
of their touch. They did not 
treat him as a criminal, but as 
a specimen. 

Men and women, clad in their 
medical smocks, they looked at 
him as though he were already 
dead. 

He tried to speak. A man, 
older and more authoritative 
than the others, said firmly and 
clearly, “Do not worry about 
talking. I will talk to you myself 
in a very little time. What 
we are having now are the pre- 
liminaries, to determine your 
physical condition. Turn around, 
please.” 

Mercer turned around. An or- 
derly rubbed his back with a 
very strong antiseptic. 

“This is going to sting,” said 
one of the technicians, “but it 



is nothing serious or painful. We 
are determining the toughness of 
the different layers of your 
skin.” 

Mercer, annoyed by this im- 
personal approach, spoke up just 
as a sharp little sting burned him 
above the sixth lumbar vertebra. 
“Don’t you know who I am?” 
“Of course we know who you 
are,” said a woman’s voice. “We 
have it all in a file in the corner. 
The chief doctor will talk about 
your crime later, if you want to 
talk about it. Keep quiet now. 
We are making a skin test, and 
you will feel much better if you 
do not make us prolong it.” 
Honesty forced her to add 
another sentence: “And we will 
get better results as well.” 

They had lost no time at all 
in getting to work. 

He peered at them sidewise to 
look at them. There was nothing 
about them to indicate that they 
were human devils in the ante- 
chambers of hell itself. Nothing 
was there to indicate that this 
was the satellite of Shayol, the 
final and uttermost place of 
chastisement and shame. They 
looked like medical people from 
his life before he committed the 
crime without a name. 

They changed from one rou- 
tine to another. A woman, wear- 
ing a surgical mask, waved her 
hand at a white table. 

“Climb up on that, please.”

GALAXY 



No one had said “please” to 
Mercer since the guards had 
seized him at the edge of the 
palace. He started to obey her 
and then he saw that there were 
padded handcuffs at the head of 
the table. He stopped. 

“Get along, please,” she de- 
manded. Two or three of the 
others turned around to look at 
both of them. 

The second “please” shook 
him. He had to speak. These 
were people, and he was a per- 
son again. He felt his voice ris- 
ing, almost cracking into shrill- 
ness as he asked her, “Please 
ma’am, is the punishment going 
to begin?” 

46 f TVHERE’S no punishment 
here,” said the woman. 
“This is the satellite. Get on the 
table. We’re going to give you 
your first skin-toughening before 
you talk to the head doctor. 
Then you can tell him all about 
your crime — ” 

“You know my crime?” he 
said, greeting it almost like a 
neighbor. 

“Of course not,” said she, “but 
all the people who come through 
here are believed to have com- 
mitted crimes. Somebody thinks 
so or they wouldn’t be here. 
Most of them want to talk about 
their personal crimes. But don’t 
slow me down. I’m a skin tech- 
nician, and down on the surface 



of Shayol you’re going to need 
the very best work that any of 
us can do for you. Now get on 
that table. And when you are 
ready to talk to the chief you’ll 
have something to talk about 
beside your crime.” 

He complied. 

Another masked person, prob- 
ably a girl, took his hands in 
cool, gentle fingers and fitted 
them to the padded cuffs in a 
way he had never sensed before. 
By now he thought he knew every 
interrogation machine in the 
whole empire, but this was noth- 
ing like any of them. 

The orderly stepped back. 
“All clear, sir and doctor.” 

“Which do you prefer?” said 
the skin technician. “A great 
deal of pain or a couple of 
hour’s unconsciousness?” 

“Why should I want pain?” 
said Mercer. 

“Some specimens do,” said the 
technician, “by the time they ar- 
rive here. I suppose it depends 
on what people have done to 
them before they got here. I 
take it you did not get any of 
the dream-punishments.” 

“No,” said Mercer. “I missed 
those.” He thought to himself, I 
didn’t know that I missed any- 
thing at all. 

He remembered his last trial, 
himself wired and plugged in to 
the witness stand. The room had 
been high and dark. Bright blue 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL

light shone on the panel of 
judges, their judicial caps a fan- 
tastic parody of the episcopal 
mitres of long, long ago. The 
judges were talking, but he 
could not hear them. Momen- 
tarily the insulation slipped and 
he heard one of them say, “Look 
at that white, devilish face. A 
man like that is guilty of every- 
thing. I vote for Pain Terminal.” 
“Not Planet Shayol?” said a sec- 
ond voice. “The dromozoa 
place,” said a third voice. “That 
should suit him,” said the first 
voice. One of the judicial engi- 
neers must then have noticed 
that the prisoner was listening 
illegally. He was cut off. Mercer 
then thought that he had gone 
through everything which the 
cruelty and intelligence of man- 
kind could devise. 

But this woman said he had 
missed the dream-punishments. 
Could there be people in the 
universe even worse off than 
himself? There must be a lot of 
people down on Shayol. They 
never came back. 

He was going to be one of 
them; would they boast to him 
of what they had done, before 
they were made to come to this 
place? 

“You asked for it,” said the 
woman technician. “It is just an 
ordinary anesthetic. Don’t panic 
when you awaken. Your skin is 
going to be thickened and 



strengthened chemically and bio- 
logically.” 

“Does it hurt?” 

“Of course,” said she. “But get 
this out of your head. We’re not 
punishing you. The pain here is 
just ordinary medical pain. Any- 
body might get it if they needed 
a lot of surgery. The punish- 
ment, if that’s what you want to 
call it, is down on Shayol. Our 
only job is to make sure that 
you are fit to survive after you 
are landed. In a way, we are 
saving your life ahead of time. 
You can be grateful for that if 
you want to be. Meanwhile, you 
will save yourself a lot of 
trouble if you realize that your 
nerve endings will all respond to 
the change in the skin. You had 
better expect to be very uncom- 
fortable when you recover. But 
then, we can help that, too.” She 
brought down an enormous lever 
and Mercer blacked out. 

HEN he came to, he was 
in an ordinary hospital 
room, but he did not notice it. 
He seemed bedded in fire. He 
lifted his hand to see if there 
were flames on it. It looked the 
way it always had, except that 
it was a little red and a little 
swollen. He tried to turn in the 
bed. The fire became a scorch- 
ing blast which stopped him in 
mid-turn. Uncontrollably, he 
moaned.

GALAXY 



A voice spoke, “You are ready 
for some pain-killer.” 

It was a girl nurse. “Hold your 
head still,” she said, “and I will 
give you half an amp of pleasure. 
Your skin won’t bother you 
then.” 

She slipped a soft cap on his 
head. It looked like metal but 
it felt like silk. 

He had to dig his fingernails 
into his palms to keep from 
threshing about on the bed. 

“Scream if you want to,” she 
said. “A lot of them do. It will 
just be a minute or two before 
the cap finds the right lobe in 
your brain.” 

She stepped to the corner and 
did something which he could 
not see. 

There was the flick of a 
switch. 

The fire did not vanish from 
his skin. He still felt it; but 
suddenly it did not matter. His 
mind was full of delicious pleas- 
ure which throbbed outward 
from his head and seemed to 
pulse down through his nerves. 
He had visited the pleasure 
palaces, but he had never felt 
anything like this before. 

He wanted to thank the girl, 
and he twisted around in the 
bed to see her. He could feel his 
whole body flash with pain as he 
did so, but the pain was far 
away. And the pulsating pleas- 
ure which coursed out of his 



head, down his spinal cord and 
into his nerves was so intense 
that the pain got through only 
as a remote, unimportant signal. 

She was standing very still in 
the corner. 

“Thank you, nurse,” said he. 

She said nothing. 

He looked more closely, 
though it was hard to look 
while enormous pleasure pulsed 
through his body like a sym- 
phony written in nerve-messages. 
He focused his eyes on her and 
saw that she too wore a soft 
metallic cap. 

He pointed at it. 

She blushed all the way down 
to her throat. 

She spoke dreamily, “You 
looked like a nice man to me. 
I didn’t think you’d tell on 
me. .” 

He gave her what he thought 
was a friendly smile, but with 
the pain in his skin and the 
pleasure bursting out of his 
head, he really had no idea of 
what his actual expression might 
be. “It’s against the law,” he 
said. “It’s terribly against the 
law. But it is nice.” 

“How do you think we stand 
it here?” said the nurse. “You 
specimens come in here talking 
like ordinary people and then 
you go down to Shayol. Terrible 
things happen to you on Shayol. 
Then the surface station sends 
up parts of you, over and over 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL

again. I may see your head ten 
times, quick-frozen and ready 
for cutting up, before my two 
years are up. You prisoners 
ought to know how we suffer,” 
she crooned, the pleasure-charge 
still keeping her relaxed and 
happy, “you ought to die as soon 
as you get down there and not 
pester us with your torments. 
We can hear you screaming, you 
know. You keep on sounding 
like people even after Shayol be- 
gins to work on you. Why do 
you do it, Mr. Specimen?” She 
giggled sillily. “You hurt our 
feelings so. No wonder a girl like 
me has to have a little jolt now 
and then. It’s real, real dreamy 
and I don’t mind getting you 
ready to go down on Shayol.” 
She staggered over to his bed. 
“Pull this cap off me, will you? 
I haven’t got enough will power 
left to raise my hands.” 

ll/TERCER saw his hand trem- 
ble as he reached for the 

cap. 

His fingers touched the girl’s 
soft hair through the cap. As he 
tried to get his thumb under 
the edge of the cap, in order to 
pull it off, he realized that this 
was the loveliest girl he had 
ever touched. He felt that he 
had always loved her, that he al- 
ways would. He cap came off. 
She stood erect, staggering a 
little before she found a chair to 



hold to. She closed her eyes and 
breathed deeply. 

“Just a minute,” she said in 
her normal voice. “I’ll be with 
you in just a minute. The only 
time I can get a jolt of this is 
when one of you visitors gets a 
dose to get over the skin 
trouble.” 

She turned to the room mirror 
to adjust her hair. Speaking with 
her back to him, she said, “I 
hope I didn’t say anything about 
downstairs.” 

Mercer still had the cap on. 
He loved this beautiful girl who 
had put it on him. He was ready 
to weep at the thought that she 
had had the same kind of pleas- 
ure which he still enjoyed. Not 
for the world would he say any- 
thing which could hurt her feel- 
ings. He was sure she wanted to 
be told that she had not said 
anything about “downstairs” — 
probably shop talk for the sur- 
face of Shayol — so he assured 
her warmly, “You said nothing. 
Nothing at all.” 

She came over to the bed, 
leaned, kissed him on the lips. 
The kiss was as far away as the 
pain; he felt nothing; the Ni- 
agara of throbbing pleasure 
which poured through his head 
left no room for more sensation. 
But he liked the friendliness of 
it. A grim, sane corner of his 
mind whispered to him that this 
was probably the last time he 



14 



GALAXY 



would ever kiss a woman, but it 
did not seem to matter. 

With skilled fingers she ad- 
justed the cap on his head. 
“There, now. You’re a sweet guy. 
I’m going to pretend-forget and 
leave the cap on you till the 
doctor comes.” 

With a bright smile she 
squeezed his shoulder. 

She hastened out of the room. 

The white of her skirt flashed 
prettily as she went out the 
door. He saw that she had very 
shapely legs indeed. 

She was nice, but the cap . 
ah, it was the cap that mattered! 
He closed his eyes and let the 
cap go on stimulating the pleas- 
ure centers of his brain. The 
pain in his skin was still there, 
but it did not matter any more 
than did the chair standing in 
the corner. The pain was just 
something that happened to be 
in the room. 

A FIRM touch on his arm 
made him open his eyes. 

The older, authoritative-look- 
ing man was standing beside the 
bed, looking down at him with 
a quizzical smile. 

“She did it again,” said the 
old man. 

Mercer shook his head, trying 
to indicate that the young nurse 
had done nothing wrong. 

“I’m Doctor Vomact,” said 
the older man, “and I am going 



to take this cap off you. You 
will then experience the pain 
again, but I think it will not be 
so bad. You can have the cap 
several more times before you 
leave here.” 

With a swift, firm gesture he 
snatched the cap off Mercer’s 
head. 

Mercer promptly doubled up 
with the inrush of fire from his 
skin. He started to scream and 
then saw that Doctor Vomact 
was watching him calmly. 

Mercer gasped, “It is — easier 
now.” 

“I knew it would be,” said the 
doctor. “I had to take the cap 
off to talk to you. You have a 
few choices to make.” 

“Yes, doctor,” gasped Mercer. 

“You have committed a seri- 
ous crime and you are going 
down to the surface of Shayol.” 

“Yes,” said Mercer. 

“Do you want to tell me your 
crime?” 

Mercer thought of the white 
palace walls in perpetual sun- 
light, and the soft mewing of the 
little things when he reached 
them. He tightened his arms, 
legs, back and jaw. “No,” he 
said, “I don’t want to talk about 
it. It’s the crime without a name. 
Against the Imperial family . .” 

“Fine,” said the doctor, “that’s 
a healthy attitude. The crime is 
past. Your future is ahead. Now, 
I can destroy your mind before 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL

you go down — if you want me 
to.” 

“That’s against the law,” said 
Mercer. 

Doctor Vomact smiled warmly 
and confidently. “Of course it is. 
A lot of things are against hu- 
man law. But there are laws of 
science, too. Your body, down on 
Shayol, is going to serve science. 
It doesn’t matter to me whether 
that body has Mercer’s mind or 
the mind of a low-grade shell- 
fish. I have to leave enough 
mind in you to keep the body 
going, but I can wipe out the 
historic you and give your body 
a better chance of being happy. 
It’s your choice, Mercer. Do you 
want to be you or not?” 

Mercer shook his head back 
and forth, “I don’t know.” 

“I’m taking a chance,” said 
Doctor Vomact, “in giving you 
this much leeway. I’d have it 
done if I were in your position. 
It’s pretty bad down there.” 

Mercer looked at the full, 
broad face. He did not trust the 
comfortable smile. Perhaps this 
was a trick to increase his pun- 
ishment. The cruelty of the 
Emperor was proverbial. Look 
at what he had done to the 
widow of his predecessor, the 
Dowager Lady Da. She was 
younger than the Erpperor him- 
self, and he had sent her to a 
place worse than death. If he 
had been sentenced to Shayol, 



why was this doctor trying to 
interfere with the rules? Maybe 
the doctor himself had been con- 
ditioned, and did not know what 
he was offering. 

Doctor Vomact read Mercer’s 
face. “All right. You refuse. You 
want to take your mind down 
with you. It’s all right with me. 
I don’t have you on my con- 
science. I suppose you’ll refuse 
the next offer too. Do you want 
me to take your eyes out before 
you go down? You’ll be much 
more comfortable without vision. 
I know that, from the voices that 
we record for the warning broad- 
casts. I can sear the optic nerves 
so that there will be no chance 
of your getting vision again.” 
Mercer rocked back and forth. 
The fiery pain had become a 
universal itch, but the soreness 
of his spirit was greater than the 
discomfort of his skin. 

“You refuse that, too?” said 
the doctor. 

“I suppose so,” said Mercer. 
“Then all I have to do is to 
get ready. You can have the cap 
for a while, if you want.” 

Tl/TERCER said, “Before I put 
the cap on, can you tell 
me what happens down there?” 
“Some of it,” said the doctor. 
“There is an attendant. He is a 
man, but not a human being. He 
is a homunculus fashioned out 
of cattle material. He is intelli- 



16 



GALAXY 



gent and very conscientious. You 
specimens are turned loose on 
the surface of Shayol. The drom- 
ozoa are a special life-form 
there. When they settle in your 
body, B’dikkat — that’s the at- 
tendant — carves them out with 
an anesthetic and sends them up 
here. We freeze the tissue cul- 
tures, and they are compatible 
with almost any kind of oxygen- 
based life. Half the surgical re- 
pair you see in the whole 
universe comes out of buds that 
we ship from here. Shayol is a 
very healthy place, so far as 
survival is concerned. You won’t 
die.” 

“You mean,” said Mercer, 
“that I am getting perpetual 
punishment.” 

“I didn’t say that,” said Doctor 
Vomact. “Or if I did, I was 
wrong. You won’t die soon. I 
don’t know how long you will 
live down there. Remember, no 
matter how uncomfortable you 
get, the samples which B’dikkat 
sends up will help thousands of 
people in all the inhabited 
worlds. Now take the cap.” 

“I’d rather talk,” said Mercer. 
“It may be my last chance.” 

The doctor looked at him 
strangely. “If you can stand that 
pain, go ahead and talk.” 

“Can I commit suicide down 
there?” 

“I don’t know,” said the doc- 
tor. “It’s never happened. And 



to judge by the voices, you’d 
think they wanted to.” 

“Has anybody ever come back 
from Shayol?” 

“Not since it was put off lim- 
its about four hundred years 
ago.” 

“Can I talk to other people 
down there?” 

“Yes,” said the doctor. 

“Who punishes me down 
there?” 

“Nobody does, you fool,” cried 
Doctor Vomact. “It’s not punish- 
ment. People don’t like it down 
on Shayol, and it’s better, I 
guess, to get convicts instead of 
volunteers. But there isn’t any- 
body against you at all.” 

“No jailers?” asked Mercer, 
with a whine in his voice. 

“No jailers, no rules, no pro- 
hibitions. Just Shayol, and B’d- 
ikkat to take care of you. Do 
you still want your mind and 
your eyes?” 

“I’ll keep them,” said Mercer. 
“I’ve gone this far and I might 
as well go the rest of the way.” 

“Then let me put the cap on 
you for your second dose,” said 
Doctor Vomact. 

The doctor adjusted the cap 
just as lightly and delicately as 
had the nurse; he was quicker 
about it. There was no sign of 
his picking out another cap for 
himself. 

The inrush of pleasure was 
like a wild intoxication. His 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



17 



burning skin receded into dis- 
tance. The doctor was near in 
space, but even the doctor did 
not matter. Mercer was not 
afraid of Shayol. The pulsation 
of happiness out of his brain was 
too great to leave room for fear 
or pain. 

Doctor Vomact was holding 
out his hand. 

Mercer wondered why, and 
then realized that the wonderful, 
kindly cap-giving man was of- 
fering to shake hands. He lifted 
his own. It was heavy, but his 
arm was happy, too. 

They shook hands. It was 
curious, thought Mercer, to feel 
the handshake beyond the dou- 
ble level of cerebral pleasure 
and dermal pain. 

“Good-by, Mr. Mercer,” said 
the doctor. “Goodby and a good 
good night. .” 

II 

r T'HE ferry satellite was a hos- 
pitable place. The hundreds 
of hours that followed were like 
a long, weird dream. 

Twice again the young nurse 
sneaked into his bedroom with 
him when he was being given 
the cap and had a cap with him. 
There were baths which calloused 
his whole body. Under strong 
local anesthetics, his teeth were 
taken out and stainless steel took 
their place. There were irradia- 



tions under blazing lights which 
took away the pain of his skin. 
There were special treatments for 
his fingernails and toenails. Grad- 
ually they changed into formid- 
able claws; he found himself strop- 
ping them on the aluminum bed 
one night and saw that they left 
deep marks. 

His mind never became com- 
pletely clear. 

Sometimes he thought that he 
was home with his mother, that 
he was little again, and in pain. 
Other times, under the cap, he 
laughed in his bed to think that 
people were sent to this place 
for punishment when it was all 
so terribly much fun. There 
were no trials, no questions, no 
judges. Food was good, but he 
did not think about it much; the 
cap was better. Even when he 
was awake, he was drowsy. 

At last, with the cap on him, 
they put him into a adiabatic 
pod — a one-body missile which 
could be dropped from the ferry 
to the planet below. He was all 
closed in, except for his face. 

Doctor Vomact seemed to 
swim into the room. “You are 
strong, Mercer,” the doctor 
shouted, “you are very strong! 
Can you hear me?” 

Mercer nodded. 

“We wish you well, Mercer. 
No matter what happens, re- 
member you are helping other 
people up here.” 



18 



GALAXY 



“Can I take the cap with me?” 
said Mercer. 

For an answer, Doctor Vo- 
mact removed the cap himself. 
Two men closed the lid of the 
pod, leaving Mercer in total 
darkness. His mind started to 
clear, and he panicked against 
his wrappings. 

There was the roar of thunder 
and the taste of blood. 

next thing that Mercer 
A knew, he was in a cool, cool 
room, much chillier than the 
bedrooms and operating rooms 
of the satellite. Someone was 
lifting him gently onto a table. 

He opened his eyes. 

An enormous face, four times 
the size of any human face 
Mercer had ever seen, was look- 
ing down at him. Huge brown 
eyes, cowlike in their gentle in- 
offensiveness, moved back and 
forth as the big face examined 
Mercer’s wrappings. The face 
was that of a handsome man of 
middle years, clean-shaven, hair 
chestnut-brown, with sensual full 
lips and gigantic but healthy 
yellow teeth exposed in a half 
smile. The face saw Mercer’s 
eyes open, and spoke with a 
deep friendly roar. 

“I’m your best friend. My 
name is B’dikkat, but you don’t 
have to use that here. Just call 
me Friend, and I will always 
help you.” 



“I hurt,” said Mercer. 

“Of course you do. You hurt 
all over. That’s a big drop,” said 
B’dikkat. 

“Can I have a cap, please,” 
begged Mercer. It was not a 
question; it was a demand; 
Mercer felt that his private in- 
ward eternity depended on it. 

B’dikkat laughed. “I haven’t 
any caps down here. I might use 
them myself. Or so they think. 
I have other things, much better. 
No fear, fellow, I’ll fix you up.” 

Mercer looked doubtful. If the 
cap had brought him happiness 
on the ferry, it would take at 
least electrical stimulation of the 
brain to undo whatever torments 
the surface of Shayol had to 
offer. 

B’dikkat’s laughter filled the 
room like a bursting pillow. 

“Have you ever heard of con- 
damine?” 

“No,” said Mercer. 

“It’s a narcotic so powerful 
that the pharmacopeias are not 
allowed to mention it.” 

“You have that?” said Mercer 
hopefully. 

“Something better. I have 
super-condamine. It’s named af- 
ter the New French town where 
they developed it. The chemists 
hooked in one more hydrogen 
molecule. That gave it a real 
jolt. If you took it in your pres- 
ent shape, you’d be dead in 
three minutes, but those three 



20 



GALAXY 



minutes would seem like ten 
thousand years of happiness to 
the inside of your mind.” B’dik- 
kat rolled his brown cow eyes 
expressively and smacked his 
rich red lips with a tongue of 
enormous extent. 

“What’s the use of it, then?” 

“You can take it,” said B’dik- 
kat. “You can take it after you 
have been exposed to the 
dromozoa outside this cabin. 
You get all the good effects and 
none of the bad. You want to 
see something?” 

What answer is there except 
yes, thought Mercer grimly; does 
he think I have an urgent invi- 
tation to a tea party? 

“Look out the window,” said 
B’dikkat, “and tell me what you 
see.” 

The atmosphere was clear. 
The surface was like a desert, 
ginger-yellow with streaks of 
green where lichen and low 
shrubs grew, obviously stunted 
and tormented by high, dry 
winds. The landscape was mo- 
notonous. Two or three hundred 
yards away there was a herd of 
bright pink objects which 
seemed alive, but Mercer could 
not see them well enough to de- 
scribe them clearly. Further 
away, on the extreme right of 
his frame of vision, there was 
the statue of an enormous hu- 
man foot, the height of a six- 
story building. Mercer could not 



see what the foot was connected 
to. “I see a big foot,” said he, 
“but — ” 

“But what?” said B’dikkat, 
like an enormous child hiding 
the denouement of a hugely pri- 
vate joke. Large as he was, he 
would have been dwarfed by 
any one of the toes on that tre- 
mendous foot. 

“But it can’t be a real foot,” 
said Mercer. 

“It is,” said B’dikkat. “That’s 
Go-Captain Alvarez, the man 
who found this planet. After six 
hundred years he’s still in fine 
shape. Of course, he’s mostly 
dromozootic by now, but I think 
there is some human conscious- 
ness inside him. You know what 
I do?” 

“What?” said Mercer. 

“I give him six cubic centi- 
meters of super-condamine and 
he snorts for me. Real happy 
little snorts. A stranger might 
think it was a volcano. That’s 
what super-condamine can do. 
And you’re going to get plenty 
of it. You’re a lucky, lucky man, 
Mercer. You have me for a 
friend, and you have my needle 
for a treat. I do all the work 
and you get all the fun. Isn’t 
that a nice surprise?” 

Mercer thought, You’re lying! 
Lying! Where do the screams 
come from that we have all 
heard broadcast as a warning on 
Punishment Day? Why did the 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



21 



doctor offer to cancel my brain 
or to take out my eyes? 

The cow-man watched him 
sadly, a hurt expression on his 
face. “You don’t believe me,” he 
said, very sadly. 

“It’s not quite that,” said 
Mercer, with an attempt at 
heartiness, “but I think you’re 
leaving something out.” 

“Nothing much,” said B’dik- 
kat. “You jump when the dro- 
mozoa hit you. You’ll be upset 
when you start growing new 
parts — heads, kidneys, hands. 
I had one fellow in here who 
grew thirty-eight hands in a 
single session outside. I took 
them all off, froze them and sent 
them upstairs. I take good care 
of everybody. You’ll probably 
yell for a while. But remember, 
just call me Friend, and I have 
the nicest treat in the universe 
waiting for you. Now, would you 
like some fried eggs? I don’t eat 
eggs myself, but most true men 
like them.” 

“Eggs?” said Mercer. “What 
have eggs got to do with it?” 
“Nothing much. It’s just a 
treat for you people. Get some- 
thing in your stomach before 
you go outside. You’ll get 
through the first day better.” 
Mercer, unbelieving, watched 
as the big man took two pre- 
cious eggs from a cold chest, 
expertly broke them into a little 
pan and put the pan in the heat- 



field at the center of the table 
Mercer had awakened on. 

“Friend, eh?” B’dikkat grinned. 
“You’ll see I’m a good friend. 
When you go outside, remember 
that.” 

A N hour later, Mercer did go 
outside. 

Strangely at peace with him- 
self, he stood at the door. B’dikkat 
pushed him in a brotherly way, 
giving him a shove which was 
gentle enough to be an encour- 
agement. 

“Don’t make me put on my 
lead suit, fellow.” Mercer had 
seen a suit, fully the size of an 
ordinary space-ship cabin, hang- 
ing on the wall of an adjacent 
room. “When I close this door, 
the outer one will open. Just 
walk on out.” 

“But what will happen?” said 
Mercer, the fear turning around 
in his stomach and making little 
grabs at his throat from the in- 
side. 

“Don’t start that again,” said 
B’dikkat. For an hour he had 
fended off Mercer’s questions 
about the outside. A map? B’dik- 
kat had laughed at the thought. 
Food? He said not to worry. 
Other people? They’d be there. 
Weapons? What for, B’dikkat 
had replied. Over and over 
again, B’dikkat had insisted that 
he was Mercer’s friend. What 
would happen to Mercer? The 



22 



GALAXY 



same that happened to every 
body else. 

Mercer stepped out. 

Nothing happened. The day 
was cool. The wind moved 
gently against his toughened 
skin. 

Mercer looked around appre- 
hensively. 

The mountainous body of 
Captain Alvarez occupied a good 
part of the landscape to the 
right. Mercer had no wish to get 
mixed up with that. He glanced 
back at the cabin. B’dikkat was 
not looking out the window. 

Mercer walked slowly, straight 
ahead. 

There was a flash on the 
ground, no brighter than the 
glitter of sunlight on a fragment 
of glass. Mercer felt a sting in 
the thigh, as though a sharp in- 
strument had touched him 
lightly. He brushed the place 
with his hand. 

It was as though the sky fell 
in. 

A pain — it was more than a 
pain: it was a living throb — 
ran from his hip to his foot on 
the right side. The throb reached 
up to his chest, robbing him of 
breath. He fell, and the ground 
hurt him. Nothing in the hospi- 
tal-satellite had been like this. 
He lay in the open air, trying 
not to breathe, but he did 
breathe anyhow. Each time he 
breathed, the throb moved with 



his thorax. He lay on his back, 
looking at the sun. At last he 
noticed that the sun was violet- 
white. 

It was no use even thinking of 
calling. He had no voice. Ten- 
drils of discomfort twisted within 
him. Since he could not stop 
breathing, he concentrated on 
taking air in the way that hurt 
him least. Gasps were too much 
work. Little tiny sips of air hurt 
him least. 

The desert around him was 
empty. He could not turn his 
head to look at the cabin. Is this 
it? he thought. Is an eternity of 
this the punishment of Shayol? 

There were voices near him. 

Two faces, grotesquely pink, 
looked down at him. They might 
have been human. The man 
looked normal enough, except 
for having two noses side by 
side. The woman was a carica- 
ture beyond belief. She had 
grown a breast on each cheek 
and a cluster of naked baby-like 
fingers hung limp from her fore- 
head. 

“It’s a beauty,” said the wo- 
man, “a new one.” 

“Come along,” said the man. 

They lifted him to his feet. 
He did not have strength enough 
to resist. When he tried to speak 
to them a harsh cawing sound, 
like the cry of an ugly bird, 
came from his mouth. 

They moved with him effi- 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



23 



ciently. He saw that he was be- 
ing dragged to the herd of pink 
things. 

As they approached, he saw 
that they were people. Better, he 
saw that they had once been 
people. A man with the beak of 
a flamingo was picking at his 
own body. A woman lay on the 
ground; she had a single head, 
but beside what seemed to be 
her original body, she had a 
boy’s naked body growing side- 
wise from her neck. The boy- 
body, clean, new, paralytically 
helpless, made no movement 
other than shallow breathing. 
Mercer looked around. The only 
one of the group who was wear- 
ing clothing was a man with his 
overcoat on sidewise. Mercer 
stared at him, finally realizing 
that the man had two — or was 
it three? — stomachs growing 
on the outside of his abdomen. 
The coat held them in place. 
The transparent peritoneal wall 
looked fragile. 

“New one,” said his female 
captor. She and the two-nosed 
man put him down. 

TPHE group lay scattered on the 
ground. 

Mercer lay in a state of stupor 
among them. 

An old man’s voice said, “I’m 
afraid they’re going to feed us 
pretty soon.” 

“Oh, no!” “It’s too early!” “Not 



again!” Protests echoed from the 
group. 

The old man’s voice went on, 
“Look, near the big toe of the 
mountain!” 

The desolate murmur in the 
group attested their confirmation 
of what he had seen. 

Mercer tried to ask what it 
was all about, but produced only 
a caw. 

A woman — was it a woman? 
— crawled over to him on her 
hands and knees. Beside her or- 
dinary hands, she was covered 
with hands all over her trunk 
and halfway down her thighs. 
Some of the hands looked old 
and withered. Others were as 
fresh and pink as the baby-fin- 
gers on his captress’ face. The 
woman shouted at him, though 
it was not necessary to shout. 

“The dromozoa are coming. 
This time it hurts. When you get 
used to the place, you can dig 
in — ” 

She waved at a group of 
mounds which surrounded the 
herd of people. 

“They’re dug in,” she said. 

Mercer cawed again. 

“Don’t you worry,” said the 
hand-covered woman, and gasped 
as a flash of light touched her. 

The lights reached Mercer 
too. The pain was like the first 
contact but more probing. Mer- 
cer felt his eyes widen as odd 
sensations within his body led to 



24 



GALAXY 



an inescapable conclusion: these 
lights, these things, these what- 
ever-they-were, were feeding him 
and building him up. 

Their intelligence, if they had 
it, was not human, but their mo- 
tives were clear. In between the 
stabs of pain he felt them fill 
his stomach, put water in his 
blood, draw water from his kid- 
neys and bladder, massage his 
heart, move his lungs for him. 

Every single thing they did 
was well meant and beneficent 
in intent. 

And every single action hurt. 

Abruptly, like the lifting of a 
cloud of insects, they were gone. 
Mercer was aware of a noise 
somewhere outside — a brain- 
less, bawling cascade of ugly 
noise. He started to look around. 
And the noise stopped. 

It had been himself, scream- 
ing. Screaming the ugly screams 
of a psychotic, a terrified drunk, 
an animal driven out of under- 
standing or reason. 

When he stopped, he found he 
had his speaking voice again. 

A man came to him, naked 
like the others. There was a 
spike sticking through his head. 
The skin had healed around it 
on both sides. “Hello, fellow,” 
said the man with the spike. 

“Hello,” said Mercer. It was a 
foolishly commonplace thing to 
say in a place like this. 

“You can’t kill yourself,” said 



the man with the spike through 
his head. 

“Yes, you can,” said the wom- 
an, covered with hands. 

Mercer found that his first 
pain had disappeared. “What’s 
happening to me?” 

“You got a part,” said the 
man with the spike. “They’re al- 
ways putting parts on us. After 
a while B’dikkat comes and cuts 
most of them off, except for the 
ones that ought to grow a little 
more. Like her,” he added, nod- 
ding at the woman who lay with 
the boy-body growing from her 
neck. 

“And that’s all?” said Mercer. 
“The stabs for the new parts 
and the stinging for the feeding.” 

“No,” said the man. “Some- 
times they think we’re too cold 
and they fill our insides with 
fire. Or they think we’re too hot 
and they freeze us, nerve by 
nerve.” 

The woman with the boy- 
body called over, “And some- 
times they think we’re unhappy, 
so they try to force us to be 
happy. 7 think that’s the worst 
of all.” 

Mercer stammered, “Are you 
people — I mean — are you the 
only herd?” 

The man with the spike 
coughed instead of laughing. 
“Herd! That’s funny. The land 
is full of people. Most of them 
dig in. We’re the ones who can 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



25 



still talk; we stay together for 
company. We get more turns 
with B’dikkat that way.” 

Mercer started to ask another 
question, but he felt the strength 
run out of him. The day had 
been too much. 

The ground rocked like a ship 
on water. The sky turned black. 
He felt someone catch him as 
he fell. He felt himself being 
stretched out on the ground. 
And then, mercifully and magi- 
cally, he slept. 

Ill 

ITHIN a week, he came to 
know the group well. They 
were an absent-minded bunch of 
people. Not one of them ever 
knew when a dromozoon might 
flash by and add another part. 
Mercer was not stung again, but 
the incision he had obtained just 
outside the cabin was hardening. 
Spike-head looked at it when 
Mercer modestly undid his belt 
and lowered the edge of his 
trouser-top so they could see the 
wound. 

“You’ve got a head,” he said. 
“A whole baby head. They’ll be 
glad to get that one upstairs 
when B’dikkat cuts it off you.” 
The group even tried to ar- 
range his social life. They intro- 
duced him to the girl of the 
herd. She had grown one body 
after another, pelvis turning into 



shoulders and the pelvis below 
that turning into shoulders again 
until she' was five people long. 
Her face was unmarred. She 
tried to be friendly to Mercer. 

He was so shocked by her 
that he dug himself into the soft 
dry crumbly earth and stayed 
there for what seemed like a 
hundred years. He found later 
that it was less than a full day. 
When he came out, the long 
many-bodied girl was waiting for 
him. 

“You didn’t have to come out 
just for me,” said she. 

Mercer shook the dirt off him- 
self. 

He looked around. The violet 
sun was going down, and the sky 
was streaked with blues, deeper 
blues and trails of orange sunset. 

He looked back at her. “I 
didn’t get up for you. It’s no use 
lying there, waiting for the next 
time.” 

“I want to show you some- 
thing,” she said. She pointed to 
a low hummock. “Dig that up.” 

Mercer looked at her. She 
seemed friendly. He shrugged and 
attacked the soil with his power- 
ful claws. With tough skin and 
heavy digging-nails on the ends 
of his fingers, he found it was 
easy to dig like a dog. The earth 
cascaded beneath his busy 
hands. Something pink appeared 
down in the hole he had dug. 
He proceeded more carefully. 



26 



GALAXY 



He knew what it would be. 

It was. It was a man, sleeping. 
Extra arms grew down one side 
of his body in an orderly series. 
The other side looked normal. 

Mercer turned back to the 
many-bodied girl, who had 
writhed closer. 

“That’s what I think it is, 
isn’t it?” 

“Yes,” she said. “Doctor Vo- 
mact burned his brain out for 
him. And took his eyes out, too.” 

Mercer sat back on the 
ground and looked at the girl. 
“You told me to do it. Now tell 
me what for.” 

“To let you see. To let you 
know. To let you think.” 

“That’s all?” said Mercer. 

The girl twisted with startling 
suddenness. All the way down 
her series of bodies, her chests 
heaved. Mercer wondered how 
the air got into all of them. He 
did not feel sorry for her; he did 
not feel sorry for anyone except 
himself. When the spasm passed 
the girl smiled at him apolo- 
getically. 

“They just gave me a new 
plant.” 

Mercer nodded grimly. 

“What now, a hand? It seems 
you have enough.” 

“Oh, those,” she said, looking 
back at her many torsos. “I 
promised B’dikkat that I’d let 
them grow. He’s good. But that 
man, stranger. Look at that man 



you dug up. Who’s better off, he 
or we?” 

Mercer stared at her. “Is that 
what you had me dig him up 
for?” 

“Yes,” said the girl. 

“Do you expect me to 
answer?” 

“No,” said the girl, “not now.” 

“Who are you?” said Mercer. 

“We never ask that here. It 
doesn’t matter. But since you’re 
new, I’ll tell you. I used to be 
the Lady Da — the Emperor’s 
stepmother.” 

“You!” he exclaimed. 

She smiled, ruefully. “You’re 
still so fresh you think it mat- 
ters! But I have something more 
important to tell you.” She 
stopped and bit her lip. 

“What?” he urged. “Better tell 
me before I get another bite. I 
won’t be able to think or talk 
then, not for a long time. Tell 
me now.” 

She brought her face close to 
his. It was still a lovely face, 
even in the dying orange of this 
violet-sunned sunset. “People 
never live forever.” 

“Yes,” said Mercer. “I knew 
that.” 

“ Believe it,” ordered the Lady 
Da. 

Lights flashed across the dark 
plain, still in the distance. Said 
she, “Dig in, dig in for the night. 
They may miss you.” 

Mercer started digging. He 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



27 



glanced over at the man he had 
dug up. The brainless body, with 
motions as soft as those of a 
starfish under water, was push- 
ing its way back into the earth. 

T^IVE or seven days later, 
there was a shouting through 
the herd. 

Mercer had come to know a 
half-man, the lower part of 
whose body was gone and whose 
viscera were kept in place with 
what resembled a translucent 
plastic bandage. The half-man 
had shown him how to lie still 
when the dromozoa came with 
their inescapable errands of do- 
ing good. 

Said the half-man, “You can’t 
fight them. They made Alvarez 
as big as a mountain, so that he 
never stirs. Now they’re trying 
to make us happy. They feed us 
and clean us and sweeten us up. 
Lie still. Don’t worry about 
screaming. We all do.” 

“When do we get the drug?” 
said Mercer. 

“When B’dikkat comes.” 

B’dikkat came that day, push- 
ing a sort of wheeled sled ahead 
of him. The runners carried it 
over the hillocks; the wheels 
worked on the surface. 

Even before he arrived, the 
herd sprang into furious action. 
Everywhere, people were digging 
up the sleepers. By the time 
B’dikkat reached their waiting 



place, the herd must have un- 
covered twice their own number 
of sleeping pink bodies — men 
and woman, young and old. The 
sleepers looked no better and no 
worse than the waking ones. 

“Hurry!” said the Lady Da. 
“He never gives any of us a shot 
until we’re all ready.” 

B’dikkat wore his heavy lead 
suit. 

He lifted an arm in friendly 
greeting, like a father returning 
home with treats for his chil- 
dren. The herd clustered around 
him but did not crowd him. 

He reached into the sled. 
There was a harnessed bottle 
which he threw over his shoul- 
ders. He snapped the locks on 
the straps. From the bottle there 
hung a tube. Midway down the 
tube there was a small pressure- 
pump. At the end of the tube 
there was a glistening hypodermic 
needle. 

When ready, B’dikkat ges- 
tured for them to come closer. 
They approached him with ra- 
diant happiness. He stepped 
through their ranks and past 
them, to the girl who had the 
boy growing from her neck. 
His mechanical voice boomed 
through the loudspeaker set in 
the top of his suit. 

“Good girl. Good, good girl. 
You get a big, big present.” He 
thrust the hypodermic into her 
so long that Mercer could see 



28 



GALAXY 



an air bubble travel from the 
pump up to the bottle. 

Then he moved back to the 
others, booming a word now 
and then, moving with improb- 
able grace and speed amid the 
people. His needle flashed as he 
gave them hypodermics under 
pressure. The people dropped to 
sitting position or lay down on 
the ground as though half-asleep. 

TTE knew Mercer. “Hello, fel- 
low. Now you can have 
the fun. It would have killed 
you in the cabin. Do you have 
anything for me?” 

Mercer stammered, not know- 
ing what B’dikkat meant, and 
the two-nosed man answered for 
him, “I think he has a nice baby 
head, but it isn’t big enough for 
you to take yet.” 

Mercer never noticed the 
needle touch his arm. 

B’dikkat had turned to the 
next knot of people when the 
super-condamine hit Mercer. 

He tried to run after B’dikkat, 
to hug the lead space suit, to tell 
B’dikkat that he loved him. He 
stumbled and fell, but it did not 
hurt. 

The many-bodied girl lay near 
him. Mercer spoke to her. 

“Isn’t it wonderful? You’re 
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. 
I’m so happy to be here.” 

The woman covered with 
growing hands came and sat be- 



side them. She radiated warmth 
and good fellowship. Mercer 
thought that she looked very 
distinguished and charming. He 
struggled out of his clothes. It 
was foolish and snobbish to wear 
clothing when none of these nice 
people did. 

The two women babbled and 
crooned at him. 

With one corner of his mind 
he knew that they were saying 
nothing, just expressing the eu- 
phoria of a drug so powerful 
that the known universe had 
forbidden it. With most of his 
mind he was happy. He won- 
dered how anyone could have 
the good luck to visit a planet 
as nice as this. He tried to tell 
the Lady Da, but the words 
weren’t quite straight. 

A painful stab hit him in the 
abdomen. The drug went after 
the pain and swallowed it. It 
was like the cap in the hospital, 
only a thousand times better. 
The pain was gone, though it 
had been crippling the first time. 

He forced himself to be delib- 
erate. He rammed his mind into 
focus and said to the two ladies 
who lay pinkly nude beside him 
in the desert, “That was a good 
bite. Maybe I will grow another 
head. That would make B’dikkat 
happy!” 

The Lady Da forced the fore- 
most of her bodies in an upright 
position. Said she, “I’m strong, 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



29 



too. I can talk. Remember, man, 
remember. People never live for- 
ever. We can die, too, we can 
die like real people. I do so be- 
lieve in death!” 

Mercer smiled at her through 
his happiness. 

“Of course you can. But isn’t 
this nice . .” 

With this he felt his lips 
thicken and his mind go slack. 
He was wide awake, but he did 
not feel like doing anything. In 
that beautiful place, among all 
those companionable and attrac- 
tive people, he sat and smiled. 

B’dikkat was sterilizing his 
knives. 

1Y/JERCER wondered how long 
the super-condamine had 
lasted him. He endured the minis- 
trations of the dromozoa with- 
out screams or movement. The 
agonies of nerves and itching of 
skin were phenomena which 
happened somewhere near him, 
but meant nothing. He watched 
his own body with remote, cas- 
ual interest. The Lady Da and 
the hand-covered woman stayed 
near him. After a long time the 
half-man dragged himself over 
to the group with his powerful 
arms. Having arrived he blinked 
sleepily and friendlily at them, 
and lapsed back into the restful 
stupor from which he had 
emerged. Mercer saw the sun 
rise on occasion, closed his eyes 
30 



briefly, and opened them to see 
stars shining. Time had no 
meaning. The dromozoa fed him 
in their mysterious way; the 
drug canceled out his needs for 
cycles of the body. 

At last he noticed a return 
of the inwardness of pain. 

The pains themselves had not 
changed; he had. 

He knew all the events which 
could take place on Shayol. He 
remembered them well from his 
happy period. Formerly he had 
noticed them — now he felt 
them. 

He tried to ask the Lady Da 
how long they had had the drug, 
and how much longer they 
would have to wait before they 
had it again. She smiled at him 
with benign, remote happiness; 
apparently her many torsos, 
stretched out along the ground, 
had a greater capacity for re- 
taining the drug than did his 
body. She meant him well, but 
was in no condition for articulate 
speech. 

The half-man lay on the 
ground, arteries pulsating pret- 
tily behind the half-transparent 
film which protected his abdom- 
inal cavity. 

Mercer squeezed the man’s 
shoulder. 

The half-man woke, recog- 
nized Mercer and gave him a 
healthily sleepy grin. 

“ ‘A good morrow to you, my 
GALAXY 



boy.’ That’s out of a play. Did 
you ever see a play?” 

“You mean a game with 
cards?” 

“No,” said the half-man, “a 
sort of eye-machine with real 
people doing the figures.” 

“I never saw that,” said Mer- 
cer, “but I — ” 

“But you want to ask me 
when B’dikkat is going to come 
back with the needle.” 

“Yes,” said Mercer, a little 
ashamed of his obviousness. 

“Soon,” said the half-man. 
“That’s why I think of plays. We 
all know what is going to hap- 
pen. We all know when it is 
going to happen. We all know 
what the dummies will do — ” 
he gestured at the hummocks in 
which the decorticated men were 
cradled — “and we all know 
what the new people will ask. 
But we never know how long a 
scene is going to take.” 

“What’s a ‘scene’?” asked Mer- 
cer. “Is that the name for the 
needle?” 

The half-man laughed with 
something close to real humor. 
“No, no, no. You’ve got the 
lovelies on the brain. A scene is 
just a part of a play. I mean we 
know the order in which things 
happen, but we have no clocks 
and nobody cares enough to 
count days or to make calendars 
and there’s not much climate 
here, so none of us know how 



long anything takes. The pain 
seems short and the pleasure 
seems long. I’m inclined to think 
that they are about two Earth- 
weeks each.” 

Mercer did not know what an 
“Earth-week” was, since he had 
not been a well-read man before 
his conviction, but he got noth- 
ing more from the half-man at 
that time. The half-man received 
a dromozootic implant, turned 
red in the face, shouted sense- 
lessly at Mercer, “Take it out, 
you fool! Take it out of me!” 

When Mercer looked on help- 
lessly, the half-man twisted over 
on his side, his pink dusty back 
turned to Mercer, and wept 
hoarsely and quietly to himself. 

TI/I'ERCER himself could not 
tell how long it was before 
B’dikkat came back. It might 
have been several days. It might 
have been several months. 

Once again B’dikkat moved 
among them like a father; once 
again they clustered like chil- 
dren. This time B’dikkat smiled 
pleasantly at the little head 
which had grown out of Mercer’s 
thigh — a sleeping child’s head, 
covered with light hair on top 
and with dainty eyebrows over 
the resting eyes. Mercer got the 
blissful needle. 

When B’dikkat cut the head 
from Mercer’s thigh, he felt the 
knife grinding against the carti- 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



31 



lage which held the head to his 
own body. He saw the child- 
face grimace as the head was 
cut; he felt the far, cool flash of 
unimportant pain, as B’dikkat 
dabbed the wound with a corro- 
sive antiseptic which stopped all 
bleeding immediately. 

The next time it was two legs 
growing from his chest. 

Then there had been another 
head beside his own. 

Or was that after the torso 
and legs, waist to toe-tips, of the 
little girl which had grown from 
his side? 

He forgot the order. 

He did not count time. 

Lady Da smiled at him often, 
but there was no love in this 
place. She had lost the extra 
torsos. In between teratologies, 
she was a pretty and shapely 
woman; but the nicest thing 
about their relationship was her 
whisper to him, repeated some 
thousands of time, repeated with 
smiles and hope, “People never 
live forever.” 

She found this immensely 
comforting, even though Mercer 
did not make much sense out of 
it. 

Thus events occurred, and vic- 
tims changed in appearance, and 
new ones arrived. Sometimes 
B’dikkat took the new ones, rest- 
ing in the everlasting sleep of 
their burned-out brains, in a 
ground-truck to be added to 



other herds. The bodies in the 
truck threshed and bawled with- 
out human speech when the 
dromozoa struck them. 

Finally, Mercer did manage to 
follow B’dikkat to the door of 
the cabin. He had to fight the 
bliss of super-condamine to do 
it. Only the memory of previous 
hurt, bewilderment and perplex- 
ity made him sure that if he did 
not ask B’dikkat when he, Mer- 
cer, was happy, the answer 
would no longer be available 
when he needed it. Fighting 
pleasure itself, he begged B’dik- 
kat to check the records and to 
tell him how long he had been 
there. 

B’dikkat grudgingly agreed, 
but he did not come out of the 
doorway. He spoke through the 
public address box built into the 
cabin, and his gigantic voice 
roared out over the empty plain, 
so that the pink herd of talking 
people stirred gently in their 
happiness and wondered what 
their friend B’dikkat might be 
wanting to tell them. When he 
said it, they thought it exceed- 
ingly profound, though none of 
them understood it, since it was 
simply the amount of time that 
Mercer had been on Shayol: 

“Standard years — eighty- 
four years, seven months, three 
days, two hours, eleven and one 
half minutes. Good luck, fellow.” 

Mercer turned away. 



34 



GALAXY 



The secret little corner of his 
mind, which stayed sane through 
happiness and pain, made him 
wonder about B’dikkat. What 
persuaded the cow-man to re- 
main on Shayol? What kept him 
happy without super-condamine? 
Was B’dikkat a crazy slave to 
his own duty or was he a man 
who had hopes of going back to 
his own planet some day, sur- 
rounded by a family of little 
cow-people resembling himself? 
Mercer, despite his happiness, 
wept a little at the strange fate 
of B’dikkat. His own fate he ac- 
cepted. 

He remembered the last time 
he had eaten — actual eggs 
from an actual pan. The dromo- 
zoa kept him alive, but he did 
not know how they did it. 

He staggered back to the 
group. The Lady Da, naked in 
the dusty plain, waved a hospi- 
table hand and showed that 
there was a place for him to sit 
beside her. There were un- 
claimed square miles of seating 
space around them, but he ap- 
preciated the kindliness of her 
gesture none the less. 

IV 

r T , HE years, if they were years, 
went by. The land of Shayol 
did not change. 

Sometimes the bubbling sound 
of geysers came faintly across the 



plain to the herd of men; those 
who could talk declared it to be 
the breathing of Captain Alvarez. 
There was night and day, but no 
setting of crops, no change of sea- 
son, no generations of men. Time 
stood still for these people, and 
their load of pleasure was so 
commingled with the shocks and 
pains of the dromozoa that the 
words of the Lady Da took on 
very remote meaning. 

“People never live forever.” 

Her statement was a hope, not 
a truth in which they could be- 
lieve. They did not have the wit 
to follow the stars in their 
courses, to exchange names with 
each other, to harvest the experi- 
ence of each for the wisdom of 
all. There was no dream of escape 
for these people. Though they 
saw the old-style chemical 
rockets lift up from the field be- 
yond B’dikkat’s cabin, they did 
not make plans to hide among the 
frozen crop of transmuted flesh. 

Far long ago, some other 
prisoner than one of these had 
tried to write a letter. His hand- 
writing was on a rock. Mercer 
read it, and so had a few of the 
others, but they could not tell 
which man had done it. Nor did 
they care. 

The letter, scraped on stone, 
had been a message home. They 
could still read the opening: 
“Once, I was like you, stepping 
out of my window at the end of 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



35 



day, and letting the winds blow 
me gently toward the place I 
lived in. Once, like you, I had one 
head, two hands, ten fingers on 
my hands. The front part of my 
head was called a face, and I 
could talk with it. Now I can 
only write, and that only when I 
get out of pain. Once, like you, I 
ate foods, drank liquid, had a 
name. I cannot remember the 
name I had. You can stand up, 
you who get this letter. I cannot 
even stand up. I just wait for the 
lights to put my food in me mole- 
cule by molecule, and to take it 
out again. Don’t think that I am 
punished any more. This place 
is not a punishment. It is some- 
thing else.” 

Among the pink herd, none of 
them ever decided what was 
“something else.” 

Curiosity had died among 
them long ago. 

r T , HEN came the day of the 
little people. 

It was a time — not an hour, 
not a year: a duration somewhere 
between them — when the Lady 
Da and Mercer sat wordless with 
happiness and filled with the joy 
of super-condamine. They had 
nothing to say to one another; the 
drug said all things for them. 

A disagreeable roar . from 
B’dikkat’s cabin made them stir 
mildly. 

Those two, and one or two 



others, looked toward the speaker 
of the public address system. 

The Lady Da brought herself 
to speak, though the matter was 
unimportant beyond words. “I do 
believe,” said she, “that we used 
that call that the War Alarm.” 

They drowsed back into their 
happiness. 

A man with two rudimentary 
heads growing beside his own 
crawled over to them. All three 
heads looked very happy, and 
Mercer thought it delightful of 
him to appear in such a whimsical 
shape. Under the pulsing glow of 
super-condamine, Mercer regret- 
ted that he had not used times 
when his mind was clear to ask 
him who he had once been. He 
answered it for them. Forcing his 
eyelids open by sheer will power, 
he gave the Lady Da and Mercer 
the lazy ghost of a military salute 
and said, “Suzdal, ma’am and sir, 
former cruiser commander. They 
are sounding the alert. Wish to 
report that I am ... I am ... I 
am not quite ready for battle.” 

He dropped off to sleep. 

The gentle peremptories of the 
Lady Da brought his eyes open 
again. 

“Commander, why are they 
sounding it here? Why did you 
come to us?” 

“You, ma’am, and the gentle- 
man with the ears seem to think 
best of our group. I thought you 
might have orders.” 



36 



GALAXY 



Mercer looked around for the 
gentleman with the ears. It was 
himself. In that time his face was 
almost wholly obscured with a 
crop of fresh little ears, but he 
paid no attention to them, other 
than expecting that B’dikkat 
would cut them all off in due 
course and that the dromozoa 
would give him something else. 

The noise from the cabin rose 
to a higher, ear-splitting intensity. 

Among the herd, many people 
stirred. 

Some opened their eyes, looked 
around, murmured, “It’s a noise,” 
and went back to the happy 
drowsing with super-condamine. 

The cabin door opened. 

B’dikkat rushed out, without 
his suit. They had never seen him 
on the outside without his pro- 
tective metal suit. 

He rushed up to them, looked 
wildly around, recognized the 
Lady Da and Mercer, picked 
them up, one under each arm, 
and raced with them back to the 
cabin. He flung them into the 
double door. They landed with 
bone-splitting crashes, and found 
it amusing to hit the ground so 
hard. The floor tilted them into 
the room. Moments later, B’dik- 
kat followed. 

He roared at them, “You’re 
people, or you were. You under- 
stand people; I only obey them. 
But this I will not obey. Look 
at that!” 



Four beautiful human children 
lay on the floor. The two smallest 
seemed to be twins, about two 
years of age. There was a girl of 
five and a boy of seven or so. 
All of them had slack eyelids. 
All of them had thin red lines 
around their temples and their 
hair, shaved away, showed how 
their brains had been removed. 

B’dikkat, heedless of danger 
from dromozoa, stood beside the 
Lady Da and Mercer, shouting. 

“You’re real people. I’m just a 
cow. I do my duty. My duty does 
not include this. These are 
children.” 

nPHE wise, surviving recess of 
Mercer’s mind registered 
shock and disbelief. It was hard 
to sustain the emotion, because 
the super-condamine washed at 
his consciousness like a great tide, 
making everything seem lovely. 
The forefront of his mind, rich 
with the drug, told him, “Won’t 
it be nice to have some children 
with us!” But the undestroyed in- 
terior of his mind, keeping the 
honor he knew before he came 
to Shayol, whispered, “This is a 
crime worse than any crime we 
have committed! And the Empire 
has done it.” 

“What have you done?” said 
the Lady Da. “What can we 
do?” 

“I tried to call the satellite. 
When they knew what I was 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



37 



talking about, they cut me off. 
After all, I’m not people. The 
head doctor told me to do my 
work.” 

“Was it Doctor Vomact?” Mer- 
cer asked. 

“Vomact?” said B’dikkat. “He 
died a hundred years ago, of old 
age. No, a new doctor cut me off. 
I don’t have people-feeling, but 
I am Earth-born, of Earth blood. 
I have emotions myself. Pure 
cattle emotions! This I cannot 
permit.” 

“What have you done?” 

B’dikkat lifted his eyes to the 
window. His face was illuminated 
by a determination which, even 
beyond the edges of the drug 
which made them love him, made 
him seem like the father of this 
world — responsible, honorable, 
unselfish. 

He smiled. “They will kill me 
for it, I think. But I have put in 
the Galactic Alert — all ships 
here” 

The Lady Da, sitting back on 
the floor, declared, “But that’s 
only for new invaders! It is a 
false alarm.” She pulled herself 
together and rose to her feet. 
“Can you cut these things off me, 
right now, in case people come? 
And get me a dress. And do you 
have anything which will counter- 
act the effects of the super-con- 
damine?” 

“That’s what I wanted!” cried 
B’dikkat. “I will not take these 



children. You give me leader- 
ship.” 

There and then, on the floor of 
the cabin, he trimmed her down 
to the normal proportions of 
mankind. 

The corrosive antiseptic rose 
like smoke in the air of the 
cabin. Mercer thought it all very 
dramatic and pleasant, and 
dropped off in catnaps part of the 
time. Then he felt B’dikkat trim- 
ming him too. B’dikkat opened a 
long, long drawer and put the 
specimens in; from the cold in the 
room it must have been a refrig- 
erated locker. 

He sat them both up against 
the wall. 

“I’ve been thinking,” he said. 
“There is no antidote for super- 
condamine. Who would want 
one? But I can give you the 
hypos from my rescue boat. They 
are supposed to bring a person 
back, no matter what has hap- 
pened to that person out in 
space.” 

There was a whining over the 
cabin roof. B’dikkat knocked a 
window out with his fist, stuck 
his head out of the window and 
looked up. 

“Come on in,” he shouted. 

r T'HERE was the thud of a 
landing craft touching ground 
quickly. Doors whirred. Mercer 
wondered, mildly, why people 
dared to land on Shayol. When 



38 



GALAXY 



they came in he saw that they 
were not people; they were 
Customs Robots, who could 
travel at velocities which people 
could never match. One wore the 
insigne of an inspector. 

“Where are the invaders?” 

“There are no — ” began 
B’dikkat. 

The Lady Da, imperial in her 
posture though she was complete- 
ly nude, said in a voice of com- 
plete clarity, “I am a former 
Empress, the Lady Da. Do you 
know me?” 

“No, ma’am,” said the robot 
inspector. He looked as uncom- 
fortable as a robot could look. 
The drug made Mercer think that 
it would be nice to have robots 
for company, out on the surface 
of Shayol. 

“I declare this Top Emer- 
gency, in the ancient words. Do 
you understand? Connect me 
with the Instrumentality.” 

“We can’t — ” said the in- 
spector. 

“You can ask,” said the Lady 
Da. 

The inspector complied. 

The Lady Da turned to B’dik- 
kat. “Give Mercer and me those 
shots now. Then put us outside 
the door so the dromozoa can 
repair these scars. Bring us in as 
soon as a connection is made. 
Wrap us in cloth if you do not 
have clothes for us. Mercer can 
stand the pain.” 



“Yes,” said B’dikkat, keeping 
his eyes away from the four soft 
children and their collapsed eyes. 

The injection burned like no 
fire ever had. It must have been 
capable of fighting the super-con- 
damine, because B’dikkat put 
them through the open window, 
so as to save time going through 
the door. The dromozoa, sensing 
that they needed repair, flashed 
upon them. This time the super- 
condamine had something else 
fighting it. 

Mercer did not scream but he 
lay against the wall and wept for 
ten thousand years; in objective 
time, it must have been several 
hours. 

The Customs robots were tak- 
ing pictures. The dromozoa were 
flashing against them too, some- 
times in whole swarms, but 
nothing happened. 

Mercer heard the voice of the 
communicator inside the cabin 
calling loudly for B’dikkat. “Sur- 
gery Satellite calling Shayol. 
B’dikkat, get on the line!” 

He obviously was not replying. 

There were soft cries coming 
from the other communicator, the 
one which the customs officials 
had brought into the room. Mer- 
cer was sure that the eye-machine 
was on and that people in other 
worlds were looking at Shayol for 
the first time. 

B’dikkat came through the 
door. He had torn navigation 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



39 



charts out of his lifeboat. With 
these he cloaked them. 

Mercer noted that the Lady 
Da changed the arrangement of 
the cloak in a few minor ways 
and suddenly looked like a per- 
son of great importance. 

They re-entered the cabin 
door. 

B’dikkat whispered, as if filled 
with awe, “The Instrumentality 
has been reached, and a Lord of 
the Instrumentality is about to 
talk to you.” 

There was nothing for Mercer 
to do, so he sat back in a corner 
of the room and watched. The 
Lady Da, her skin healed, stood 
pale and nervous in the middle 
of the floor. 

The room filled with an odor- 
less intangible smoke. The smoke 
clouded. The full communicator 
was on. 

A human figure appeared. 

A WOMAN, dressed in a uni- 
form of radically conserva- 
tive cut, faced the Lady Da. 

“This is Shayol. You are the 
Lady Da. You called me.” 

The Lady Da pointed to the 
children on the floor. “This must 
not happen,” she said. “This is a 
place of punishments, agreed up- 
on between the Instrumentality 
and the Empire. No one said any- 
thing about children.” 

The woman on the screen 
looked down at the children. 



“This is the work of insane 
people!” she cried. 

She looked accusingly at the 
Lady Da, “Are you imperial?” 

“I was an Empress, madam,” 
said the Lady Da. 

“And you permit this!” 

“Permit it?” cried the Lady 
Da. “I had nothing to do with 
it.” Her eyes widened. “I am a 
prisoner here myself. Don’t you 
understand?” 

The image-woman snapped, 
“No, I don’t.” 

“I,” said the Lady Da, “am a 
specimen. Look at the herd out 
there. I came from them a few 
hours ago.” 

“Adjust me,” said the image 
woman to B’dikkat. “Let me see 
that herd.” 

Her body, standing upright, 
soared through the wall in a 
flashing arc and was placed in the 
very center of the herd. 

The Lady Da and Mercer 
watched her. They saw even the 
image lose its stiffness and dig- 
nity. The image-woman waved an 
arm to show that she should be 
brought back into the cabin. 
B’dikkat tuned her back into the 
room. 

“I owe you an apology,” said 
the image. “I am the Lady 
Johanna Gnade, one of the Lords 
of the Instrumentality.” 

Mercer bowed, lost his balance 
and had to scramble up from the 
floor. The Lady Da acknowl- 



40 



GALAXY 



edged the introduction with a 
royal nod. 

The two women looked at each 
other. 

“You will investigate,” said the 
Lady Da, “and when you have 
investigated, please put us all to 
death. You know about the 
drug?” 

“Don’t mention it,” said B’dik- 
kat, “don’t even say the name in- 
to a communicator. It is a secret 
of the Instrumentality!” 

“I am the Instrumentality,” 
said the Lady Johanna. “Are you 
in pain? I did not think that any 
of you were alive. I had heard of 
the surgery banks on your off- 
limits planet, but I thought that 
robots tended parts of people and 
sent up the new grafts by rocket. 
Are there any people with you? 
Who is in charge? Who did this 
to the children?” 

B’dikkat stepped in front of 
the image. He did not bow. “I’m 
in charge.” 

“You’re underpeople!” cried 
the Lady Johanna. “You’re a 
cow!” 

“A bull, ma’am. My family is 
frozen back on earth itself, and 
with a thousand years’ service I 
am earning their freedom and my 
own. Your other questions, 
ma’am. I do all the work. The 
dromozoa do not affect me much, 
though T have to cut a part off 
myself now and then. I throw 
those away. They don’t go into 



the bank. Do you know the secret 
rules of this place?” 

The Lady Johanna talked to 
someone behind her on another 
world. Then she looked at B’dik- 
kat and commanded, “Just don’t 
name the drug or talk too much 
about it. Tell me the rest.” 

UW/T: HAVE,” said B’dikkat 
** very formally, “thirteen 
hundred and twenty-one people 
here who can still be counted on 
to supply parts when the dromo- 
zoa implant them. There are 
about seven hundred more, in- 
cluding Go-Captain Alvarez, who 
have been so thoroughly ab- 
sorbed by the planet that it is no 
use trimming them. The Empire 
set up this place as a point of 
uttermost punishment. But the 
Instrumentality gave secret or- 
ders for medicine — ” he ac- 
cented the word strangely, 
meaning super-condamine — “to 
be issued so that the punishment 
would be counteracted. The Em- 
pire supplies our convicts; The 
Instrumentality distributes the 
surgical material.” 

The Lady Johanna lifted her 
right hand in a gesture of silence 
and compassion. She looked 
around the room. Her eyes came 
back to the Lady Da. Perhaps 
she guessed what effort the Lady 
Da had made in order to remain 
standing erect while the two 
drugs, the super-condamine and 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL 



41 



the lifeboat drug, fought within 
her veins. 

“You people can rest. I will 
tell you now that all things pos- 
sible will be done for you. The 
Empire is finished. The Funda- 
mental Agreement, by which the 
Instrumentality surrendered to 
the Empire a thousand years ago, 
has been set aside. We did not 
know that you people existed. We 
would have found out in time, but 
I am sorry we did not find out 
sooner. Is there anything we can 
do for you right away?” 

“Time is what we all have,” 
said the Lady Da. “Perhaps we 
cannot ever leave Shayol, because 
the dromozoa and the medicine. 
The one could be dangerous. The 
other must never be permitted to 
be known.” 

The Lady Johanna Gnade 
looked around the room. When 
her glance reached him, B’dikkat 
fell to his knees and lifted his 
enormous hands in complete sup- 
plication. 

“What do you want?” said she. 

“These,” said B’dikkat, pointed 
to the mutilated children. “Order 
a stop on children. Stop it now!” 
He commanded her with the last 
cry, and she accepted his com- 
mand. “And lady — ” He stopped, 
as if shy. 

“Yes? Go on.” 

“Lady, I am unable to kill. It 
is not in my nature. To work, to 
help, but not to kill. What do I 



do with these?” He gestured at 
the four motionless children on 
the floor. 

“Keep them,” she said. “Just 
keep them.” 

“I can’t,” he said. “There’s no 
way to get off this planet alive. I 
do not have food for them in the 
cabin. They will die in a few 
hours. And governments,” he 
added wisely, “take a long, long 
time to do things.” 

“Can you give them the 
medicine? >> 

“No, it would kill them if I 
give them that stuff first before 
the dromozoa have fortified their 
bodily processes.” 

The Lady Johanna Gnade 
filled the room with tinkling 
laughter that was very close to 
weeping. “Fools, poor fools, and 
the more fool I! If super-con- 
damine works only after the 
dromozoa, what is the purpose of 
the secret?” 

B’dikkat rose to his feet, of- 
fended. He frowned, but he could 
not get the words with which to 
defend himself. 

The Lady Da, ex-empress of a 
fallen empire, addressed the 
other lady with ceremony and 
force: “Put them outside, so they 
will be touched. They will hurt. 
Have B’dikkat give them the 
drug as soon as he thinks it safe. 
I beg your leave, my lady. .” 

Mercer had to catch her before 
she fell. 



42 



GALAXY 



44'V7’OU’VE all had enough,” 
said the Lady Johanna. “A 
storm ship with heavily armed 
troops is on its way to your ferry 
satellite. They will seize the medi- 
cal personnel and find out who 
committed this crime against 
children.” 

Mercer dared to speak. “Will 
you punish the guilty doctor?” 
“You speak of punishment,” 
she cried. “You!” 

“It’s fair. I was punished for do- 
ing wrong. Why shouldn’t he be?” 
“Punish — punish!” she said 
to him. “We will cure that doctor. 
And we will cure you too, if we 
can.” 

Mercer began to weep. He 
thought of the oceans of happi- 
ness which super-condamine had 
brought him, forgetting the hide- 
ous pain and the deformities on 
Shayol. Would there be no next 
needle? He could not guess what 
life would be like off Shayol. Was 
there to be no more tender, 
fatherly B’dikkat coming with his 
knives? 

He lifted his tear-stained face 
to the Lady Johanna Gnade and 
choked out the words, “Lady, we 
are all insane in this place. I do 
not think we want to leave.” 

She turned her face away, 
moved by enormous compassion. 
Her next words were to B’dikkat. 
“You are wise and good, even if 
you are not a human being. Give 
them all of the drug they can 



take. The Instrumentality will 
decide what to do with all of you. 
I will survey your planet with 
robot soldiers. Will the robots be 
safe, cowman?” 

B’dikkat did not like the 
thoughtless name she called him, 
but he held no offense. “The 
robots will be all right, ma’am, 
but the dromozoa will be excited 
if they cannot feed them and 
heal them. Send as few as you 
can. We do not know how the 
dromozoa live or die.” 

“As few as I can,” she mur- 
mured. She lifted her hand in 
command to some technician un- 
imaginable distances away. The 
odorless smoke rose about her 
and the image was gone. 

A shrill cheerful voice spoke 
up. “I fixed your window,” said 
the customs robot. B’dikkat 
thanked him absentmindedly. He 
helped Mercer and the Lady Da 
into the doorway. When they had 
gotten outside, they were prompt- 
ly stung by the dromozoa. It did 
not matter. 

B’dikkat himself emerged, car- 
rying the four children in his two 
gigantic, tender hands. He lay 
the slack bodies on the ground 
near the cabin. He watched as the 
bodies went into spasm with the 
onset of the dromozoa. Mercer 
and the Lady Da saw that his 
brown cow eyes were rimmed 
with red and that his huge cheeks 
were dampened by tears.

Hours or centuries. 

Who could tell them apart? 

The herd went back to its 
usual life, except that the inter- 
vals between needles were much 
shorter. The once-commander, 
Suzdal, refused the needle when 
he heard the news. Whenever he 
could walk, he followed the cus- 
toms robot around as they photo- 
graphed, took soil samples, and 
made a count of the bodies. They 
were particularly interested in 
the mountain of the Go-Captain 
Alvarez and professed themselves 
uncertain as to whether there was 
organic life there or not. The 
mountain did appear to react to 
super-condamine, but they could 
find no blood, no heart-beat. 
Moisture, moved by the dromo- 
zoa, seemed to have replaced the 
once-human bodily processes. 

V 

A ND then, early one morning, 
the sky opened. 

Ship after ship landed. People 
emerged, wearing clothes. 

The dromozoa ignored the 
newcomers. Mercer, who was in 
a state of bliss, confusedly tried 
to think this through until he 
realized that the ships were 
loaded to their skins with com- 
munications machines; the “peo- 
ple” were either robots or images 
of persons in other places. 

The robots swiftly gathered to- 



gether the herd. Using wheel- 
barrows, they brought the hun- 
dreds of mindless people to the 
landing area. 

Mercer heard a voice he knew. 
It was the Lady Johanna Gnade. 
“Set me high,” she commanded. 

Her form rose until she seemed 
one-fourth the size of Alvarez. 
Her voice took on more volume. 

“Wake them all,” she com- 
manded. 

Robots moved among them, 
spraying them with a gas which 
was both sickening and sweet. 
Mercer felt his mind go clear. 
The super-condamine still oper- 
ated in his nerves and veins, but 
his cortical area was free of it. He 
thought clearly. 

“I bring you,” cried the com- 
passionate feminine voice of the 
gigantic Lady Johanna, “the 
judgment of the Instrumentality 
on the planet Shayol. 

“Item: the surgical supplies 
will be maintained and the 
dromozoa will not be molested. 
Portions of human bodies will be 
left here to grow, and the grafts 
will be collected by robots. 
Neither man nor homunculus will 
live here again. 

“Item: the underman B’dikkat, 
of cattle extraction, will be re- 
warded by an immediate return 
to earth. He will be paid twice his 
expected thousand years of 
earnings.” 

The voice of B’dikkat, without 



GALAXY 



amplification, was almost as loud 
as hers through the amplifier. He 
shouted his protest, “Lady, 
Lady!” 

She looked down at him, his 
enormous body reaching to ankle 
height on her swirling gown, and 
said in a very informal tone, 
“What do you want?” 

“Let me finish my work first,” 
he cried, so that all could hear. 
“Let me finish taking care of 
these people.” 

The specimens who had minds 
all listened attentively. The 
brainless ones were trying to dig 
themselves back into the soft 
earth of Shayol, using their 
powerful claws for the purpose. 
Whenever one began to disap-

pear, a robot seized him by a 
limb and pulled him out again. 

“Item: cephalectomies will be 
performed on all persons with ir- 
recoverable minds. Their bodies 
will be left here. Their heads will 
be taken away and killed as 
pleasantly as we can manage, 
probably by an overdosage of 
super-condamine.” 

“The last big jolt,” murmured 
Commander Suzdal, who stood 
near Mercer. “That’s fair enough.” 
“Item: the children have been 
found to be the last heirs of the 
Empire. An over-zealous official 
sent them here to prevent their 
committing treason when they 
grew up. The doctor obeyed 
orders without questioning them. 
Both the official and the doctor 
have been cured and their mem- 
ories of this have been erased, so 
that they need have no shame 
or grief for what they have done.” 
“It’s unfair,” cried the half- 
man. “They should be punished 
as we were!” 

The Lady Johanna Gnade 
looked down at him. “Punishment 
is ended. We will give you any- 
thing you wish, but not the pain 
of another. I shall continue. 

“Item: since none of you wish 
to resume the lives which you led 
previously, we are moving you to 
another planet nearby. It is simi- 
lar to Shayol, but much more 
beautiful. There are no dromo- 
zoa.” 



A PLANET NAMED SHAYOL

A T this an uproar seized the 
herd. They shouted, wept, 
cursed, appealed. They all 
wanted the needle, and if they 
had to stay on Shayol to get it, 
they would stay. 

“Item,” said the gigantic image 
of the lady, overriding their 
babble with her great but femin- 
ine voice, “you will not have 
super-condamine on the new 
planet, since without dromozoa it 
would kill you. But there will be 
caps. Remember the caps. We 
will try to cure you and to make 
people of you again. But if you 
give up, we will not force you. 
Caps are very powerful; with 
medical help you can live under 
them many years.” 

A hush fell on the group. In 
their various ways, they were try- 
ing to compare the electrical caps 
which had stimulated their pleas- 
ure-lobes with the drug which 
had drowned them a thousand 
times in pleasure. Their murmur 
sounded like assent. 

“Do you have any questions?” 
said the Lady Johanna. 

“When do we get the caps?” 
said several. They were human 
enough that they laughed at their 
own impatience. 

“Soon,” said she reassuringly, 
“very soon.” 

“Very soon,” echoed B’dikkat, 
reassuring his charges even 
though he was no longer in con- 
trol. 



“Question,” cried the Lady 
Da. 

“My Lady . .?” said the Lady 
Johanna, giving the ex-empress 
her due courtesy. 

“Will we be permitted mar- 
riage?” 

The Lady Johanna looked 
astonished. “I don’t know.” She 
smiled. “I don’t know any reason 
why not — ”' 

“I claim this man Mercer,” said 
the Lady Da. “When the drugs 
were deepest, and the pain was 
greatest, he was the one who al- 
ways tried to think. May I have 
him?” 

Mercer thought the procedure 
arbitrary but he was so happy 
that he said nothing. The Lady 
Johanna scrutinized him and 
then she nodded. She lifted her 
arms in a gesture of blessing and 
farewell. 

The robots began to gather the 
pink herd into two groups. One 
group was to whisper in a ship 
over to a new world, new prob- 
lems and new lives. The other 
group, no matter how much its 
members tried to scuttle into the 
dirt, was gathered for the last 
honor which humanity could pay 
their manhood. 

B’dikkat, leaving everyone 
else, jogged with his bottle across 
the plain to give the mountain- 
man Alvarez an especially large 
gift of delight.

For that real deep-down badness, 
nothing beats the Good Old Days. 




MACHINE 



ET HIM alone,” said 
Stephen’s father. “It’s 
I A a phase they all go 
through. He’ll snap out of it.” 
Stephen didn’t really believe 
he was ever going to snap out of 
it, but he was grateful that his 
folks let him alone. He wasn’t 
worried what they thought, just 
as long as they allowed him to 
watch the viddies. 

Because his father was rich and 
connected with the university 
labs, Stephen had his own viddie 
set. While his parents indulged 
their normal tastes and watched 
the adult mush on the wall down- 
stairs, Stephen stayed in his room 
and his own world. 

It was a wonderful world for 

47 



any thirteen-year-old — the world 
called the Good Old Days. There 
were all kinds of viddie shows 
about the golden pioneer era of 
seventy-five years ago, the mar- 
velous time when heroes like 
Dion O’Bannion and Hymie 
Weiss walked the Earth. 

Stephen watched a show called 
Big Jim — about Big Jim Colo- 
simo and his lovable friends. He 
watched The Enforcer; that was 
the one about Frank Nitti. He 
was a man of action, like the 
heroes of Johnny Torrio and Legs 
Diamond. The Legs Diamond 
show was very exciting, because 
Legs was the one who always 
danced his way around the bul- 
lets in a gang war. That was how 
he got his name. 

Stephen learned a lot about 
the people who had lived in the 
romantic past. He knew about 
flashy gambling men like fancy 
Arnold Rothstein, who was so 
suave, and wild rascals like Bugs 
Moran. There was a new show 
out called The Great Dillinger, 
and that was pretty good. But the 
best of all was Stephen’s favorite 
— Scarf ace Al. No wonder it was 
right up there on top with all the 
kids; its hero was Scarface Al 
Capone, the Robin Hood of 
Chicago, who took from the rich 
and gave to the poor. 

Lots of times Stephen found 
himself humming the theme song, 
which went: 



Al Capone, Al Capone, 

A mighty man who 
walked alone — 
Wherever daring deeds 
are known, 

Men sing the praise of 
Al Capone. 

Stephen liked the way the 
machine guns came in on the 
end of the last line. 

But then he liked everything 
about Al Capone; the way he got 
his scar — defending his sister 
from the crooked prohibition 
agents; the way he disguised 
himself as “Mr. Brown” when he 
was fighting the wicked cops and 
the thieving politicians of Chi- 
cago. Stephen knew all about Al 
Capone, riding in from his hide- 
out in Cicero to bring justice to 
Chicago and save pretty girls 
from the evil Vice Squad men. 

Stephen joined the “Scarface 
Al Club” and ate enough cereal 
to get himself the complete prize 
outfit — the artificial scar to 
wear, the bulletproof vest and 
everything. 

He might have been a very 
happy boy if he hadn’t found his 
uncle’s subjectivity reactor. 

TT WAS a big machine, resem- 

bling nothing quite so much 
as the genetic control, which his 
uncle had also invented. The 
genetic control was a large box 
in which a woman could sit and 



48 



GALAXY 



be bombarded by radiations 
which would eradicate recessive 
and undesirable traits in her ova, 
thus leading to the reproduction 
of healthy offspring. This appar- 
atus, marketed under the popular 
name of “Heir Conditioner,” was 
an immediate success because it 
was a failure. Nothing really hap- 
pened, but the woman who used 
it felt better; in that respect it 
resembled a face cream and had 
the additional advantage of being 
much more expensive. 

The machine which Stephen 
found — the subjectivity reactor 
— was a failure because it was 
a success. Not an immediate fail- 
ure, for it was never manufac- 
tured or marketed, but a gradual 
failure. His uncle had devised it 
while still a young man, many 
years ago, and it too was a large 
box which contained a variety of 
mechanisms. Under their stim- 
ulus, the subject became capable 
of materializing, in tangible three- 
dimensional form, his immediate 
thought patterns. 

The gradual failure came 
about because his uncle had ex- 
perimented upon himself, and 
pretty soon his home was over- 
flowing with tangible three-dimen- 
sional forms to which his wife 
objected; most particularly to the 
redheads. 

Consequently the subjectivity 
reactor was carted off to the 
storage building behind the uni- 



versity labs where Stephen’s 
uncle and father both worked, 
and no one ever mentioned that 
it was also capable, by virtue of 
the same principle of materializ- 
ing thought, of acting as a time 
machine. 

Stephen himself found it out 
by accident one day when he 
was playing around, exploring the 
deserted warehouse premises. He 
noticed the boxlike apparatus 
and crawled inside, pretending 
for the moment that he was a 
hero like Pretty-Boy Floyd, hid- 
ing out from the dirty old Feds. 
He didn’t pay much attention to 
the blinking lights and whirling 
mirrors which became self-acti- 
vating the moment he stepped 
inside and closed the door; he 
was wishing he had a gat to 
protect himself in case that arch- 
fiend J. Edgar Hoover showed up. 
He’d show him! 

“All right, copper — you asked 
for it.” And he’d reach in his 
pocket and pull out his gat, like 
this, and — 

Stephen felt the weight before 
he saw it. And then he did pull 
his hand out of his pocket and he 
was holding a gat. A real roscoe, 
a genuine equalizer. Stephen 
stared at it, his thoughts whirling 
faster than the mirrors. 

The gun — where did it come 
from? He’d just thought about it 
and it was here; how could that 
be? Actually, he hadn’t even

thought, just wished. The way he 
wished he had been around back 
in the Good Old Days, the way he 
was wishing now. He’d give any- 
thing to see real live American 
History in the making, like that 
morning of St. Valentine’s Day 
in the garage on Clark Street . 

f T^HE MIRRORS revved faster 
and suddenly they disap- 
peared. Everything disappeared. 



It was like a viddie dissolve, so 
Stephen wasn’t frightened. He 
knew the next scene would come 
up right after the commercial. 
Only this wasn’t viddie and there 
was no commercial. The next 
scene came up when the blurring 
stopped and he found himself 
sitting in the same box, the 
mirrors still whirring and he 
heard the noise outside. Stephen 
blinked, tugged at the door of 



50 



GALAXY 




the compartment, opened it, and 
saw the machine guns spit. 

He knew where he was now. 
He’d seen it a dozen times on 
viddie, imagined it a thousand 
more. The garage, at eleven 
o’clock in the morning; the two 
executioners disguised in the uni- 
forms of the hated police were 
mowing down the seven finks. 

Stephen, in the subjectivity 
reactor, had materialized at the 



very instant the firing started. 
For thirty seconds Stephen stared 
at the finks as they writhed and 
fell. And during those thirty 
seconds the finks became men. 
Men who wriggled and flopped 
after the bullets struck, until the 
two swarthy hoods in uniform 
stepped up and completed their 
work with revolvers. There was 
blood on the wall and floor, and 
a terrible, acrid odor. The two 
men noticed it, too, and com- 
mented harshly in Italian. One of 
them laughed and spat on the 
floor. 

Stephen wasn’t laughing and 
he felt that unless he got out of 
here right away he’d do more 
than spit. He started to close the 
door and it was then that the 
executioners looked up and saw 
him. 

“What the hell — ” said the 
short one, and raised his revolver. 
His taller companion slapped it 
out of his hand. 

“Wait,” he said He stooped, 
picked up the machine gun, and 
faced Stephen in the doorway of 
the compartment “Awright, kid, 
how you get in here? Where you 
come from?” He raised the muz- 
zle of his weapon. “C’mon, talk!” 

Stephen talked. It was hard to, 
with the choking in his throat as 
he watched the machine gun 
muzzle that was like a cruel 
mouth — almost as cruel as the 
mouth of the man who held it. 



CRIME MACHIN E

It was hard to explain, too, and 
he wasn’t sure he understood the 
situation himself. Certainly the 
shorter assassin didn’t under- 
stand, because he nudged his 
companion and said, “He’s nuts! 
Hurry up and give it to him — 
we gotta get outa here!” 

The big man with the machine 
gun shook his head. “Shaddup 
and listen. Dincha hear? This 
thing goes through time. It’s a 
time machine. Aincha never 
heard?” 

“Porko Dio! No such thing — ” 

“No such thing now.” The big 
man nodded. “But maybe they 
invent it later on. That’s where 
this kid comes from. How else 
you figure he got here if not like 
that?” 

“So?” 

“So you wanna get outa here, 
right?” 

“Sure, to St. Louis. That’s 
where A1 said we’d get the pay- 
off — ” 

“You know what kinda payoff 
we end up with.” The big man 
made a nasty noise in his throat. 
“But suppose we really get out. 
Suppose we go back with the 
kid here.” 

He took a step forward. “Aw- 
right, kid, whaddya say?” He 
stared at Stephen. 

OTEPHEN stared back, into his 
^ face and the face of his com- 
panion. Here was his chance to 



take two real live gangsters back 
into his own world, his own time. 
It was something he’d always 
dreamed of. Only he had never 
dreamed they really looked and 
talked like this. And he had never 
dreamed the reality he glimpsed 
over their shoulders; the torn, 
huddled, oozing reality on the 
garage floor. Now he knew all 
there was to knQw about the 
Good Old Days. 

The big man raised his weapon. 
“Hurry up! We ain’t got all day. 
Whaddya say?” 

Stephen knew he himself didn’t 
have all day, or even another 
minute. Fortunately, thanks to 
the viddies, he knew what to say 
and how to say it. His hand 
squeezed the trigger inside his 
coat pocket. First the small man 
went down and then the big man. 

As the big man fell there was 
a short, staccato burst from the 
machine gun. Several bullets 
punctured the shell of the com- 
partment. But by this time 
Stephen had slammed the door 
of the subjectivity reactor and 
hurled himself to the floor in 
quivering panic, wishing with all 
his being that he was back where 
he belonged . 

He might have had a hard 
time explaining the presence of 
the gat if he hadn’t wished so 
strongly that it would disappear. 
As it was, he emerged from the 
subjectivity reactor completely 



52 



GALAXY 



unscathed. To all intents and 
appearances, Stephen was un- 
changed by his experience. 

The thing of it was that from 
then on he never watched Scar- 
face A1 any more. 

“He’s growing up,” his mother 
said proudly. 

“What did I tell you?” his 
father said. “I knew he’d get over 
it. All it takes is time.” 

When he said, “All it takes is 
time,” he suddenly remembered 
Stephen’s visit to the old storage 
building. That night he made a 
trip there himself to confirm his 
suspicions. 

And there, as he expected, he 
found the subjectivity reactor — 
and the telltale impressions left 
by the machine-gun bullets. 

Funny thing, they didn’t pen- 
etrate with half the force of the 
old Colt .45s. Stephen’s father 
stopped until he found the holes 
near the bottom of the machine. 
Stephen’s father remembered the 
day those shots had been fired. 

Sometime he’d have to tell 
Stephen. Tell him how it was 
when he was a boy, when the 
machine had first been invented. 
Like father, like son. 

Stephen’s father gazed at the 
Colt bullet holes and smiled 
reminiscently. He too had had his 
viddie heroes in his youth. Only 
his personal favorite happened to 
be the real 1870 Wyatt Earp.

CRIME MACHINE

The creature from Venus didn't 
know right from left — and life 
and death hung in the balance! 

AMATEUR 
IT IN 
CHANCERY 

By GEORGE O. SMITH 



P AUL Wallach came into 
my office. He looked dis- 
traught. By some trick of 
selection, Paul Wallach, the direc- 
tor of Project Tunnel, was one of 
the two men in the place who did 
not have a string of doctor’s and 
scholar’s degrees to tack behind 
their names. The other was I. 
“Trouble, Paul?” I asked. 

He nodded, saying, “The tun- 
nel car is working.” 

“It should. It’s been tested 
enough.” 

“Holly Carter drew the short 
straw.” 

“Er — •” I started and then 
stopped short as the implication 
became clear. “She’s — she’s — 
not — ?” 

“Holly made it to Venus all 
right,” he said. “Trouble is we 
can’t get her back.” 

“Can’t get her back?” 

He nodded again. “You know, 
we’ve never really known very 
much about the atmosphere of 
Venus.” 

“Yes.” 

“Well, from what little came 
through just before Holly blacked 
out, it seems that there must be 
one of the cyanogens in the atmos- 
phere in a concentration high 
enough to effect nervous paraly- 
sis.” 

“Meaning?” 

“Meaning,” said Paul Wallach 
in a flat tone, “that Holly Carter 
stopped breathing shortly after 



54 



GALAXY 



she cracked the airlock. And her 
heart stopped beating a minute 
or so later.” 

“Holly — dead?” 

“Not yet, Tom,” he said. “If we 
can get her back in the next fif- 
teen or twenty minutes, modern 
medicine can bring her back.” 
“But there’ll be brain damage!” 
“Oh, there may be some tempo- 
rary impairment. Nothing that re- 
training can’t restore. The big 
problem is to bring her back.” 
“We should have built two tun- 
nel cars.” 

“We should have done all sorts 
of things. But when the terminal 
rocket landed on Venus, every- 
body in the place was too anxious 
to try it out. Lord knows, I tried 
to proceed at a less headlong pace. 
But issuing orders to you people 
is a waste of time and paper.” 

I looked at him. “Doc,” I asked, 
giving him the honorary title out 
of habit, “Venus is umpty-million 
miles from here. We haven’t 
another tunnel car, and no rocket 
could make it in time to do any 
good. So how can we hope to 
rescue Holly?” 

“That’s the point,” said Wal- 
lach. “Venus, it appears, is in- 
habited.” 

“Oh?” 

“That’s what got Holly caught 
in the first place. She landed, then 
saw this creature approaching. 
Believing that no life could exist 
in an atmosphere dangerous to 



life, she opened the airlock and 
discovered otherwise.” 

“So?” 

“So now all we have to do is 
to devise some way of explaining 
to a Venusian the difference be- 
tween left and right. I thought 
you might help.” 

“But I’m just a computer pro- 
grammer.” 

“That’s the point. We all fig- 
ured that you have developed a 
form of communication to that 
machine of yours. The rest of the 
crew, as you know, have a bit of 
difficulty in communicating 
among themselves in their own 
jargon, let alone getting through 
to normal civilians. When it 
comes to a Venusian, they’re 
licked.” 

I said, “I’ll try.” 

T>ROJECT Tunnel is the hard- 
ware phase of a program 
started a number of years ago 
when somebody took a joke seri- 
ously. 

In a discussion of how the 
tunnel diode works, one of the 
scientists pointed out that if an 
electron could be brought to ab- 
solute rest, its position according 
to Heisenberg Uncertainty would 
be completely ambiguous. Hence 
it had as high a possibility of be- 
ing found on Venus as it had 
of being found on Earth or any- 
where else. Now, the tunnel diode 
makes use of this effect by a 



AMATEUR IN CHANCERY 



55 



voltage bias across the diode 
junction. Between narrow limits, 
the voltage bias is correct to upset 
the ambiguity of Mr. Heisenberg, 
making the electron nominally 
found on one side of the junction 
more likely to be found on the 
other. 

Nobody could deny the oper- 
ability of the tunnel diode. Proj- 
ect Tunnel was a serious attempt 
to employ the tunnel effect in 
gross matter. 

The terminal rocket mentioned 
by Paul Wallach carried the 
equipment needed to establish 
the voltage bias between Venus 
and the Earth. Once established, 
Project Tunnel was in a state that 
caused it to maroon the most 
wonderful girl in the world. 

Since the latter statement is 
my own personal opinion, my 
pace from the office to the lab- 
oratory was almost a dead run. 

The laboratory was a mad- 
house. People stood in little knots, 
arguing. Those who weren’t talk- 
ing were shaking their heads in 
violent negation. 

The only one who appeared un- 
upset was Teresa Dwight, our 
psi-girl. And here I must confess 
an error. When I said that Paul 
Wallach and I were the only ones 
without a string of professorial 
degrees, I missed Teresa Dwight. 
I must be forgiven. Teresa had a 
completely bland personality, 
zero drive, and a completely un- 



startling appearance. Teresa was 
only fourteen. But she’d discov- 
ered that her psi-power could get 
her anything she really wanted. 
Being human, therefore, she did 
not want much. So forgive me for 
passing her by. 

But now I had to notice her. As 
I came in, she looked up and said, 
“Harla wants to know why can’t 
he just try.” 

W ALLACH went white. “Tell 
that Venusian thing ‘NO!’ 
as loud as you can.” 

Teresa concentrated, then 
asked, “But why?” 

“Does this Harla understand 
the Heisenberg Effect?” 

She said after a moment, “Har- 
la says he has heard of it as a 
theory. But he is not quite pre- 
pared to believe that it does in- 
deed exist as anything but an 
abstract physical concept.” 

“Tell Harla that Doctor Car- 
ter’s awkward position is a direct 
result of our ability to reduce the 
tunnel effect to operate on gross 
matter.” 

“He realizes that. But now he 
wants to know why you didn’t fire 
one of the lower animals as a 
test.” 

“Tell him that using animals 
for laboratory experiments is only 
possible in a police state where 
the anti-vivisection league can be 
exiled to Siberia. Mink coats and 
all. And let his Venusian mind 



56 



GALAXY 



make what it can of that. Now, 
Teresa — ” 

“Yes?” 

“Tell Harla, very carefully, 
that pressing the left-hand button 
will flash the tunnel car back here 
as soon as he closes the airlock. 
But tell him that pushing the 
right-hand button will create 
another bias voltage — where- 
upon another mass of matter will 
cross the junction. In effect, it 
will rip a hole out of this labora- 
tory near the terminal, over there, 
and try to make it occupy the 
same space as the tunnel car on 
Venus. None of us can predict 
what might happen when two 
masses attempt to occupy the 
same space. But the chances are 
that some of the holocaust will 
backfire across the gap and be as 
violent at this end, too.” 

“Harla says that he will touch 
nothing until he has been assured 
that it is safe.” 

“Good. Now, Tom,” he said, ad- 
dressing me, “how can we tell 
right from left?” 

“Didn’t you label ’em?” 
“They’re colored red on the 
right and green on the left.” 

“Is Harla color-blind?” 

“No, but from what I gather 
Harla sees with a different spec- 
trum than we do. So far as he is 
concerned both buttons look 
alike.” 

“You could have engraved ’em 
‘COME’ and ‘GO’.” 



Frank Crandall snorted. “May- 
be you can deliver an ‘English, 
Self-Taught’ course through Tere- 
sa to the Venusian?” 

I looked at Crandall. I didn’t 
much care for him. It seemed that 
every time Holly Carter came 
down out of her fog of theoretical 
physics long enough to notice a 
simpleton who had to have a 
machine to perform routine cal- 
culations, we were joined by 
Frank Crandall who carted her 
off and away from me. If this be 
rank jealousy, make the most of 
it. I’m human. 

“Crandall,” I said, “even to a 
Hottentot I could point out that 
the engraved legend ‘GO’ con- 
tains two squiggly symbols, 
whereas the legend ‘RETURN’ 
contains ‘many’.” 

Vtf^ALLACH stepped into the 
tension by saying, “So we 
didn’t anticipate alien life. But 
now we’ve got the problem of 
communicating with it.” 

Crandall didn’t appear to no- 
tice my stiff reply. He said, “Con- 
found it, what’s missing?” 

“What’s missing,” I told him, “is 
some common point of reference.” 
“Meaning?” 

“Meaning that I could define 
left from right to any semi-intelli- 
gent human being who was aware 
of the environment in which we 
live.” 

“For example?” 



AMATEUR IN CHANCERY 



57 



I groped for an example and 
said, lamely, “Well, there’s the 
weather rule, valid for the north- 
ern hemisphere. When the wind 
is blowing on your back, the left 
hand points to the low pressure 
center.” 

“Okay. But how about Venus? 
Astronomical information, I 
mean.” 

I shook my head. 

“Why not?” he demanded. “If 
we face north, the sun rises on 
our right, doesn’t it?” 

“Yes. Even in the southern 
hemisphere.” 

“Well, then. So it doesn’t make 
any difference which hemisphere 
they’re in.” 

“You’re correct. But you’re also 
making the assumptions that 
Venus rotates on its axis, that the 
axis is aligned parallel to the 
Earth’s and that the direction of 
rotation is the same.” 

‘We know that Venus rotates!” 

‘We have every reason to be- 
lieve so,” I agreed. “But only be- 
cause thermocouples measure a 
temperature on the darkside that 
is too high to support the theory 
that the diurnal period of Venus 
is equal to the year. I think the 
latest figures say something be- 
tween a couple of weeks and a 
few months. Next, the axis needn’t 
be parallel to anything. Shucks, 
Crandall, you know darned well 
that the solar system is a finely 
made clock with no two shafts 



aligned, and elliptical gears that 
change speed as they turn.” 

U pRACTICALLY everything 
^ in the solar system rotates 
in the same direction.” 

I looked at him. “Would you 
like to take a chance that Venus 
agrees with that statement? 
You’ve got a fifty percent chance 
that you’ll be right. Guess wrong 
and we have a metric ton of hard- 
ware trying to occupy the same 
space as another metric ton of 
matter.” 

“But — ” 

“And furthermore,” I went on, 
“we’re just lucky that Polaris hap- 
pens to be a pole star right now. 
The poles of Mars point to noth- 
ing that bright. Even then, we can 
hardly expect the Venusian to 
have divided the circumpolar sky 
into the same zoo full of mythical 
animals as our forebears — and 
if we use the commonplace 
expression, maybe the Venusian 
never paused to take a long- 
handled dipper of water from a 
well. Call them stewpots and the 
term is still insular. Sure, there’s 
lots of pointers, but they have to 
be identified. My mother always 
insisted that the Pleiades were. 
— er — was the Little Dipper.” 
Teresa Dwight spoke up, pos- 
sible for the second or third time 
in her life without being spoken 
to first. She said, “Harla has been 
listening to you through me. Of 



58 



GALAXY 



astronomy he has but a rudimen- 
tary idea. He is gratified to learn 
from you that there is a ‘sun’ that 
provides the heat and light. This 
has been a theory based upon 
common sense; something had to 
do it. But the light comes and 
goes so slowly that it is difficult 
to determine which direction the 
sun rises from. The existence of 
other celestial bodies than Venus 
is also based on logic. If, they 
claim, they exist, and their planet 
exists, then there probably are 
other planets with people who 
cannot see them, either.” 

“Quoth Pliny the Elder,” mum- 
bled Paul Wallach. 

I looked at him. 

“Pliny was lecturing about 
Pythagoras’ theory that the Earth 
is round. A heckler asked him 
why the people on the other side 
didn’t fall off. Pliny replied that 
on the other side there were un- 
doubtedly fools who were asking 
their wise men why we didn’t fall 
off.” 

“It’s hardly germane,” I said. 

“I’m sorry. Yes. And time is 
running out.” 

nPHE laboratory door opened 
to admit a newcomer, Lou 
Graham, head of the electronics 
crew. 

He said, “I’ve got it!” 

The chattering noise level died 
out about three decibels at a time. 
Lou said, “When a steel magnet 



is etched in acid, the north pole 
shows selective etching!” 

I shook my head. “Lou,” I said, 
“we don’t know whether Venus 
has a magnetic field, whether it 
is aligned to agree with the Earth’s 
— nor even whether the Venusi- 
ans have discovered the magnetic 
compass.” 

“Oh, that isn’t the reference 
point,” said Lou Graham. “I’m 
quite aware of the ambiguity. The 
magnetic field does have a vector, 
but the arrow that goes on the 
end is strictly from human agree- 
ment.” 

“So how do you tell which is 
the north pole?” 

“By making an electromagnet! 
Then using Ampere’s Right Hand 
Rule. You grasp the electromag- 
net in the right hand so that the 
fingers point along the winding 
in the direction of the current 
flow. The thumb then points to 
the north pole.” 

“Oh, fine! Isn’t that just the 
same eonfounded problem? Now 
we’ve got to find out whether 
Harla is equipped with a right 
hand complete with fingers and 
thumbs — so that we can tell him 
which his right hand is!” 

“No, no,” he said. “You don’t 
understand, Tom. We don’t need 
the right hand. Let’s wind our 
electromagnet like this: We place 
the steel bar horizontally in front 
of us. The wire from ‘Start’ leaves 
us, passes over the top of the 



AMATEUR IN CHANCERY 



59 



bar, drops below the bar on the 
far side, comes toward us on the 
under side, rises above the bar on 
the side toward us, and so on 
around and around until we’ve 
got our electromagnet wound. 
Now if the ‘start’ is positive and 
the ‘end’ is negative, the north 
pole will be at the left. It will 
show the selective etching in 
acid.” 

I looked at him. “Lou,” I said 
slowly, “if you can define positive 
and negative in un-ambiguous 
terms as well as you wound that 
electromagnet, we can get Holly 
home. Can you?” 

Lou turned to Teresa Dwight. 
“Has this Harla fellow followed 
me so far?” 

She nodded. 

“Can you speak for him?” 
“You talk, I hear, he reads me. 
I read him and I can speak.” 

66/"\KAY, then,” said Lou Gra- 
ham. “Now we build a Le 
Clanche cell. Ask Harla does he 
recognize carbon. A black or light- 
absorbing element. Carbon is ex- 
tremely common, it is the basis of 
life chemistry. It is element num- 
ber six in the periodic chart. Does 
Harla know carbon?” 

“Harla knows carbon.” 

“Now we add zinc. Zinc is a 
light metal easily extracted from 
the ore. It is fairly abundant, and 
it is used by early civilizations for 
making brass or bronze long be- 



fore the culture has advanced 
enough to recognize zinc as an 
element. Does Harla know zinc?” 
“He may,” said Teresa very 
haltingly. “What happens if Harla 
gets the wrong metal?” 

“Not very much,” said Lou. 
“Any of the light, fairly plentiful 
metals that are easily extracted 
from the ore will suffice. Say tin, 
magnesium, sodium, cadmium, so 
on.” 

“Harla says go on.” 

“Now we make an electrolyte. 
Preferably an alkaline salt.” 

“Be careful,” I said. “Or you’ll 
be asking Harla to identify stuff 
from a litmus paper.” 

“No,” said Lou. He faced 
Teresa and said, “An alkaline 
substance burns the flesh badly.” 
“So do acids,” I objected. 
“Alkaline substances are found 
in nature,” he reminded me. 
“Acids aren’t often natural. The 
point is that an acid will work. 
Even salt water will work. But an 
alkaline salt works better. At any 
rate, tell Harla that the stuff, like 
zinc, was known to civilized 
peoples many centuries before 
chemistry became a science. 
Acids, on the other hand, are 
fairly recent.” 

“Harla understands.” 

“Now,” said Lou Graham tri- 
umphantly, “we make our bat- 
tery by immersing the carbon and 
the zinc in the electrolyte. The 
carbon is the positive electrode 



60 



GALAXY 



and should be connected to the 
start of our electromagnet, 
whereas the end of the winding 
must go to the zinc. This will 
place the north pole to the left 
hand.” 

“Harla understands,” said 
Teresa. “So far, Harla can per- 
form this experiment in his mind. 
But now we must identify which 
end of the steel bar is north-pole 
magnetic.” 

“If we make the bar magnetic 
and then immerse it in acid, the 
north magnetic pole will be se- 
lectively etched.” 

“Harla says that this he does 
not know about. He has never 
heard of it, although he is quite 
familiar with electromagnets, 
batteries, and the like.” 

I looked at Lou Graham. “Did 
you cook this out of your head, 
or did you use a handbook?” 

He looked downcast. “I did use 
a handbook,” he admitted. 
“But — ” 

“Lou,” I said unhappily, “I’ve 
never said that we couldn’t es- 
tablish a common frame of ref- 
erence. What we lack is one that 
can be established in minutes. 
Something physical — ” I stopped 
short as a shadowy thought began 
to form. 

"OAUL Wallach looked at me 
as though he’d like to speak 
but didn’t want to interrupt my 
train of thoughts. When he could 



contain himself no longer, he said, 
“Out with it, Tom.” 

“Maybe,” I muttered. “Surely 
there must be something phy- 
sical.” 

“How so?” 

“The tunnel car must be full 
of it,” I said. “Screws?” 

I turned to Saul Graben. Saul 
is our mechanical genius; give 
him a sketch made on used 
Kleenex with a blunt lipstick and 
he will bring you back a gleaming 
mechanism that runs like a 
hundred-dollar wrist watch. 

But not this time. Saul shook 
his head. 

‘What’s permanent is welded 
and what’s temporary is snapped 
in with plug buttons,” he said. 

“Good Lord,” I said. “There 
simply must be something!” 
There probably is,” said Saul. 
“But this Harla chap would have 
to use an acetylene torch to get 
at it.” 

I turned to Teresa. “Can this 
psi-man Harla penetrate metal?” 
“Can anyone?” she replied 
quietly. 

Wallach touched my arm. 
“You’re making the standard, 
erroneous assumption that a sense 
of perception will give its owner 
a blueprint-clear grasp of the me- 
chanical details of some machin- 
ery. It doesn’t. Perception, as I 
understand it, is not even similar 
to eyesight.” 

“But — ” I fumbled on — 



AMATEUR IN CHANCERY 



61 



“surely there must be some com- 
mon reference there, even grant- 
ing that perception isn’t eye- 
sight. So how does perception 
work?” 

“Tom, if you were blind from 
birth, I could tell you that I have 
eyesight that permits me to see 
the details of things that you can 
determine only by feeling them. 
This you might understand basi- 
cally. But you could never be 
made to understand the true def- 
inition of the word ‘picture’ nor 
grasp the mental impression that 
is generated by eyesight.” 

“Well,” I persisted, “can he pen- 
etrate flesh?” 

“Flesh?” 

“Holly’s heart has stopped,” I 
said. “But it hasn’t been removed. 
If Harla can perceive through 
human flesh, he might be able to 
perceive the large, single organ 
in the chest cavity near the 
spine.” 

Teresa said, “Harla’s percep- 
tion gives him a blurry, incom- 
plete impression,” She looked at 
me. “It is something like a badly 
out-of-focus, grossly under-ex- 
posed x-ray solid.” 

“X-ray solid?” I asked. 

“It‘s the closest thing that you 
might be able to understand,” she 
said lamely. 

I dropped it right there. Teresa 
had probably been groping in the 
dark for some simile that would 
convey the nearest possible im- 



pression. I felt that this was going 
to be the nearest that I would 
ever get to understanding the 
sense of perception. 

“Can’t he get a clear view?” 
“He has not the right.” 

“Right!” I exploded. “Why — ” 
Wallach held up his hand to 
stop me. “Don’t make Teresa 
fumble for words, Tom. Harla has 
not the right to invade the person 
of Holly Carter. Therefore he can 
not get a clearer perception of her 
insides.” 

“Hell!” I roared. “Give Harla 
the right.” 

“No one has authority.” 
“Authority be dammed!” I bel- 
lowed angrily. “That girl’s life is 
at stake!” 

Vj^ALLACH nodded unhappily. 

» ▼ “Were this a medical emer- 
gency, a surgeon might close his 
eyes to the laws that require au- 
thorization to operate. But even 
if he saved the patient’s life, he is 
laying himself open to a lawsuit. 
But this is different, Tom. As you 
may know, the ability of any psi- 
person is measured by their wel- 
come to the information. Thus 
Teresa and Harla, both willing to 
communicate, are able.” 

“But can’t Harla understand 
that the entire bunch of us are 
willing that he should take a 
peek?” 

“Confound it, Tom, it isn’t a 
matter of our permission! It’s 



62 



GALAXY 



a matter of fact. It would ease 
things if Holly were married to 
one of us, but even so it wouldn’t 
be entirely clear. It has to do with 
the invasion of privacy.” 

“Privacy? In this case the very 
idea is ridiculous.” 

“Maybe so,” said Paul Wallach. 
“But I don’t make the rules. 
They’re natural laws. As immu- 
table as the laws of gravity or the 
refraction of light. And Tom, 
even if I were making the laws I 
might not change things. Not even 
to save Holly Carter’s life. Be- 
cause, Tom, if telepathy and 
perception were as free and un- 
bounded as some of their early 
proponents claimed, life would 
be a sheer, naked hell on earth.” 
“But what has privacy to do 
with it? This Harla isn’t at all 
humanoid. A cat can look at a 
king — ” 

“Sure, Tom. But how long 
would the cat be permitted to 
read the king’s mind?” 

I grunted. “Has this Harla any 
mental block about examining the 
outside?” 

He looked at me thoughtfully. 
“You’re thinking about a scar or 
some sort of blemish?” 

“Yes. Birthmark, maybe. No 
one is perfect.” 

“You know of any?” 

I thought. 

It was not hard for me to con- 
jure up a picture of Holly Carter. 
Unfortunately, I looked at Holly 



Carter through the eyes of love, 
which rendered her perfect. If she 
had bridgework, I hadn’t found it 
out. Her features were regular 
and her hair fell loose without a 
part. Her complexion was flaw- 
less ... at least the complexion 
that could be examined whilst 
Holly sunned herself on a deck 
chair beside the swimming pool. 

I shook my head. Then I faced 
an unhappy fact. It hurt, because 
I wanted my goddess to be per- 
fect, and if she were made of 
weak, mortal flesh, I did not want 
to find it out by asking the man 
who knew her better than I did. 

Still, I wanted her alive. So I 
turned to Frank Crandall. 

“Do you?” I asked. 

“Do I what?” 

“Know of any scars or birth- 
marks?” 

“Such as?” 

“Oh, hell,” I snapped. “Such as 
an appendix scar that might be 
used to tell left from right.” 

“Look, Tom, I’m not her phy- 
sician, you know. I can only give 
you the old answer: ‘Not until 
they wear briefer swim suits.’ ” 

My heart bounced lightly. 
That Holly was still in mortal 
danger was not enough to stop 
my elation at hearing Frank 
Crandall admit that he was not 
Holly’s lover, nor even on much 
better terms than I. It might have 
been better to face the knowledge 
that Holly was all woman and all 



AMATEUR IN CHANCERY 



63 



human even though the informa- 
tion had to come from someone 
who knew her well enough to get 
her home. 

Then I came back to earth. I 
had my perfect goddess — in 
deadly peril — instead of a hu- 
man woman who really did not 
belong to any man. 

TT HADN’T seen Saul Graben, 

leave, but he must have been 
gone because now he opened the 
door and came back. He was 
carrying a heavy rim gyroscope 
that was spinning in a set of 
frictionless gymbals. He looked 
most confused. 

He said, “I’ve spent what seems 
like an hour. You can’t tell me 
that this gizmo is inseparable 
from the selfish, insular intellect 
of terrestrial so-called homo 
sapiens.” 

He turned the base and we all 
watched the gymbal rings rotate 
to keep the gyro wheel in the 
same plane. “It should be cosmic,” 
he said. “But every time I start, 
I find myself biting myself on the 
back of the neck. Look. If you 
make the axle horizontal in front 
of you and rotate the gyro with 
the top edge going away from 
you, you can define a common re- 
ference. But motion beyond that 
cannot be explained. If the axle 
is depressed on the right side, the 
gyro will turn so the far edge 
looks to the right. But that’s de- 



fining A in terms of A. So I’m 
licked.” 

Frank Crandall shook his head. 
“There’s probably an absolute to 
that thing somewhere, but I’m 
sure none of us know it. We 
haven’t time to find it. In fact, I 
think the cause is lost. Maybe 
we’d better spend our time figur- 
ing out a plausible explanation.” 
“Explanation?” blurted Wal- 
lach. 

“Let’s face it,” said Crandall. 
“Holly Carter’s life is slipping 
away. No one has yet come close 
to finding a common reference to 
describe right from left to this 
Harla creature.” 

“So what’s your point?” 
“Death is for the dying,” 
Crandall said in a monotone. “Let 
them have their hour in peace and 
dignity. Life is for the living, and 
for the living there is no peace. 
We who remain must make the 
best of it. So now in about five 
minutes Holly will be at peace. 
The rest of us have got to answer 
for her.” 

“How do you mean?” 

“How do you propose to ex- 
plain this unfortunate incident?” 
asked Crandall. “Someone will 
want to know what happened to 
the remains of Holly Carter. I can 
see hell breaking loose. And I can 
see the whole lot of us getting 
laughed right off the Earth be- 
cause we couldn’t tell right from 
left. And I can see us all clob- 



64 



GALAXY 



bered for letting the affair take 
place.” 

“You seem to be more worried 
about your professional reputa- 
tion than about Holly Carter’s 
life!” 

“I have a future,” he said. 
“Holly doesn’t seem to. Hell,” he 
groaned, “we can’t even gamble 
on it.” 

“Gamble?” 

“How successful do you think 
you’d be in getting this Venusian 
to risk his life by closing his eyes 
and making a fifty-fifty stab in the 
dark at one of those buttons?” 

“Well — ” started Wallach — 
“we’d be gambling too, you know. 
But — ” 

VVyAIT a moment,” I said. “I’ve 
got a sort of half-cracked 
theory. May I try?” 

“Of course.” 

“Not ‘of course.’ I’ll have to 
have quiet, with just Teresa to 
communicate through.” 

“If you have any ideas, try 
them,” said Wallach. 

“Do you really know what 
you’re doing?” demanded Frank 
Crandall. 

“I think so,” I replied. “If it 
works, it’ll be because I happen to 
feel close to Holly.” 

“Could be,” he said with a 
shrug. I almost flipped. Duels 
have been fought over less. But 
instead of taking offense, Cran- 
dall topped it off by adding, “You 



could have been a lot closer if 
you’d tried. She always said you 
had the alert, pixie-type mind 
that was pure relaxation instead 
of a dead let-down after a period 
of deep concentration. But you 
were always scuttling off some- 
where. Well, go ahead and try, 
Tom. And good luck!” 

I took a deep breath. 

“Teresa?” I asked. 

“Yes, Mr. Lincoln?” 

“Tell Harla to concentrate on 
the buttons.” 

“He is.” 

“There is a subtle difference 
between them.” 

“This he knows, but he does 
not know what it is.” 

“There is a delicate difference 
in warmth. One button will be 
faintly warmer than the other.” 
“Harla has felt them.” 

I dropped the third-person 
address and spoke to Teresa as if 
she were but one end of a tele- 
phone line. “Harla,” I said, “only 
part of the difference lies in the 
warmth to physical touch. There 
should be another kind of 
warmth. Are you not affected by 
a feeling that one is better than 
the other?” 

Harla’s reply came direct 
through Teresa: “Why yes, I am 
indeed drawn to the warmer of 
the two. Were this a game I would 
wager on it. But that is emotion 
and hardly suitable as a guide.” 
“Ah, but it is!” I replied 



AMATEUR IN CHANCERY 



65 



quickly. “This is our frame of ref- 
erence. Press the warmer of the 
but — ” 

I was violently interrupted. 
Wallach shook me violently and 
hurled me away from Teresa. 
Frank Crandall was facing the 
girl, shouting, “No! No! The warm 
one will be the red one! You must 
press the green — ” 

And then he, too, was interrup- 
ted. 

Displaced air made a near- 
explosive woosh! and the tunnel 
car was there on its pad. In it was 
a nightmare horror holding a limp 
Holly Carter across its snakelike 
tentacles. A free tentacle opened 
the door. 

“Take her while I hold my 
breath,” said Harla, still talking 
through Teresa. “I’ll return the 
tunnel car empty. I can, now that 
I know that warmth is where the 
hearth is.” 

Harla dropped the unconscious 
girl in my arms and snapped 
back into the car. It disappeared, 



then returned empty just as the 
doctor was bending over Holly. 

CO now I have my Holly, but 
^-'every now and then I lie awake 
beside her in a cold sweat. Harla 
could have guessed wrong. Just 
as Wallach and Crandall had 
been wrong in assuming the red 
button would be warmer than the 
green. Their reaction was as emo- 
tional as Harla’s. 

I hope Harla either forgives me 
or never finds out that I had to 
sound sure of myself, and that I 
had to play on his emotions sim- 
ply to get him to take the 
fifty-fifty chance on his — hers — 
our lives. 

And I get to sleep only after 
I’ve convinced myself that it was 
more than chance . that some- 
how our feelings and emotions 
guided Harla where logic and def- 
inition fail. 

For right and left do not exist 
until terrestrial man defines them.

THE 




■ARTHMAH 



By FREDERIK POHL Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



O NE night when I was C.Q. 
at the 549th, the Officer of 
the Day came in, swearing, 
with a tall, dark-skinned private 
wandering sullenly along behind 
him. 

We were up to our eyeballs in 
frantic work; Trenton had just 
been evacuated. “Get me the M.P. 
barracks,” yelled the O.D. “What 
do you think? This rat’s been sell- 
ing rations to the civilians.” That 
was Lt. Lauchheimer, who was a 
pale young man with enormous 
integrity. He looked at the prison- 
er as if he wanted to kick him. I 
could understand that. 

The prisoner looked back at 
him calmly, without very much 



interest at all. He leaned back 
against the wall, put one elbow 
on the hammering teletype and 
sighed. Behind him was a poster 
of a great green bug being bay- 
oneted by an American infantry- 
man, captioned: 

SIRIANS, GO HOME! 

“Sit down,” snapped Lt. Lauch- 
heimer, “ — you. Whatever the 
hell you said your name was.” 
“He’s Private Postal, sir,” I said 
reluctantly. “Pinkman W. Postal.” 
The prisoner looked at me for 
the first time. The orderly room 
was full and bustling, so it wasn’t 



68 



GALAXY 



surprising he hadn’t noticed me. 
“Oh. Hello, Harry.” 

I dialed the M.P. barracks with- 
out answering him, but it was 
already too late. When I handed 
the phone to Lt. Lauchheimer he 
glared at me. I said, “We took 
basic together, Lieutenant. We, 
uh — We weren’t very close bud- 
dies.” 

“Sergeant, I didn’t ask you.” 

I listened while he was talking 
on the phone, although I was sup- 
posed to be checking casualty re- 
ports resulting from the morning’s 
assault on the Sirian bubble. It 
seemed that Pinky had been 
given a truckload of supplies for 
evacuees and told to deliver it 
to a relief center in Bound Brook. 
They’d picked him up in New 
Brunswick with the supplies gone 
and a pocketful of cash. It was 
about what I would have ex- 
pected. 

The M.P. jeep was there in less 
than five minutes, and Lt. Lauch- 
heimer escorted Pinky out with- 
out another word to me. But he 
didn’t forget. Two weeks later, 
when we were packing up for the 
move to Staten Island, he was in 
charge of my section and he put 
me on every rough detail he could 
think of. I guess I didn’t blame 
him. I would have done the same. 
He didn’t know me very well, but 
he knew I knew Pinky Postal. 

Lauchheimer didn’t get off my 
back until the Boston Retreat, 



when we were bombed-in togeth- 
er for twelve hours and had a 
chance to talk things over. After 
that we were pretty close. He 
asked me to come along when he 
volunteered for the Worcester 
booby-trapping mission that al- 
most worked, which I did, so in a 
way you might say that Pinky 
Postal was responsible for my get- 
ting the Congressional Medal of 
Honor. 

I’m glad I got it. There were 
fifteen awarded that day, includ- 
ing mine and Lauchheimer’s. 
They lined us up alphabetically, 
and my name begins with a “W”. 
So, although my Medal looks like 
all the others, it’s pretty special. 
It was the last one issued. After 
that the Sirians englobed Wash- 
ington. 

VK/'HEN Pinky Postal got his 
* ’ bright notion of selling GI 
canned milk in New Brunswick 
he was twenty-three years old. He 
had been drafted at nineteen, out 
of Cincinnati. 

He hated it — hated both. He 
hated being drafted; and he hated 
Cincinnati. He had never done a 
day’s work. He liked to drive 
around down in Kentucky and 
try to pick up girls, but he was 
a poor man’s son. The girls were 
not usually impreseed by his 
wobbly old Ford. In basic train- 
ing his unmade bed cost the 
whole platoon a weekend pass at 



THE ABOMINABLE EARTHMAN 



69 



Saturday inspection, so the pla- 
toon gave him a bit of a hazing. 
He wasn’t hurt. But the next day 
he went AWOL. 

He got as far as the railroad 
station. He spent the rest of the 
eight-week training cycle clean- 
ing latrines after duty hours, and 
our platoon had the dirtiest la- 
trines on the post. 

By the time the Sirians landed 
three years later Postal should 
have been out of the Army, ex- 
cept that he never stopped try- 
ing. He fought the Army with 
everything he had. A warrant of- 
ficer called him a Dutch mudheel 
— well, something like that — 
and Pinky hit him. That was 
three months in the guardhouse 
with forfeiture of pay. A mess 
sergeant got somehow in the way 
of a toppling vat of boiling dried 
Iimas after a few words with 
Pinky, who had been on KP. The 
court-martial called it deliberate 
assault with intent to maim. 
While he was awaiting trial for 
that he got out of the stockade 
and went AWOL again, and . 
add it up yourself; he had enough 
bad time to keep him in as long 
as they wanted him; and he was 
still trying to make it up when 
the Sirians blew their bubble 
around Wilmington. 

Pinky couldn’t have cared less. 

They weren’t shooting at him, 
were they? So what difference 
did it make to Pinky? What was 



there to choose between a hope- 
lessly inimical government of hu- 
man beings, whose rules were be- 
yond him, and a hopelessly alien 
government of green-chitoned 
bugs, whose rules were never ex- 
plained? 

The difference was too small 
for Pinky to bother with. Pinky 
was as much an alien as the Siri- 
ans, in his unattractive, angle- 
shooting way. 

But the Army still thought of 
him as a soldier, after all. In the 
massive redeployment that tried 
to put an armed perimeter around 
the bubble, Pinky found himself 
put to work. He hated that most 
of all. 

We were throwing everything 
we had at the Sirians. The troops 
in Delaware and Maryland lived 
in lead suits for a month because 
we tried to break in with hydro- 
gen bombs. All we accomplished 
was to kill off every green thing 
and wild animal for forty miles 
south of Wilmington. The bubble 
didn’t even bend, and the troops 
got plenty of chance to become 
pretty foul inside those suits. I 
remember it very well; I was one 
of them. 

So was Pinky but, heavens 
knows how, he managed to get 
sent north. He was supposed to 
be driving a truck again in the 
evacuation of Philadelphia. The 
place he was evacuating was Bryn 
Mawr, and probably he mistook 



70 



GALAXY 



the girls’ panic for another kind 
of excitement. They screamed to 
the colonel. Pinky wound up in a 
punishment battalion once more, 
and there he met the missionary 
from inside the bubble, an exile 
from Eden. 

IT to me straight, 
Rocco. What’s it like in 
the bubble?” 

“Go to hell.” 

“Come on, Rocco! Look, you 
don’t like working in the boiler 
room, do you? Maybe I know how 
we can cut out of here.” 

“Shut up, Postal. The ser- 
geant’s looking at us.” 

Vindictively Pinky turned the 
steam valve a moment before 
Rocco was ready for it. The high- 
temperature jet barely missed 
boiling his fingers. 

“What the hell did you do that 
for? Get off my back, Postal!” 
“Come on. What’s it like?” 
“Shut up, you two! Drag tail!" 
Pinky sulked. The job of de- 
lousing refugee clothing took two 
men, one to lift the hundred- 
pound bundles in and out of the 
steam boiler, one to turn the 
valve. Pinky was twice the size 
of the little ex-prisoner of the Sir- 
ians, but it was Pinky who sat at 
ease with one gloved hand on the 
valve. 

“Don’t you want to get out of 
here?” 

“Look, Postal. They won’t take 



me back. Now leave me alone, 
will you?” 

“. Well, what’s it like? Do 
they feed you?” 

“Sure.” 

“Work you hard?” 

The little man said dreamily, 
“There’s a stud farm down in 
Delaware. Fifteen hundred wom- 
en, they say. Only a couple dozen 
men. For breeding, see?” 

“Breeding? You mean — ” 

“They’re growing slaves, I 
guess. Well, I was working on a 
farm and they closed that up. I 
got friendly with the overseer and 
he put me in for the breeding 
farm. Plenty of food. Nothing else 
to do. I — ” 

“I’m warnin’ you two! For the 
last time." 

But then, after the last smelly, 
flea-ridden bale had come out of 
the sterilizer, Pinky had a chance 
for one more word with the mis- 
sionary. Why couldn’t he go back? 

“Postal, I don’t want to talk 
about it. They threw me out. I 
was all set, passed the overseers, 
right up to one of the bugs. He — 
He said I was too little. They 
don’t want anybody under six 
feet tall.” 

Back in the barracks, Pinky 
slipped out of his dirty GI shoes 
and painstakingly marked his 
height off on the wall. The tape 
measure showed that nothing had 
changed. He was exactly six feet, 
one and a quarter inches tall.

them was when the Russian radio 
satellite began a frantic emergen- 
cy message in clear, and then 
went dead before it finished. Then 
all the other space stations went 
dead. 

Then the ship came down on 
Australia and, pop, up went the 
pale green bubble. 

The bubbles were like a wall, 
except more flexible and beauti- 
fully controlled. The rule was: 
What the Sirians wanted to pass 
could pass; everything else could 
not. 

Time passed; the other ships 
landed; there were more bubbles. 

Then the bubbles grew bubbles. 
They clustered in groups, expand- 
ing. Sometimes the new bubbles 
were big, sometimes small. Some- 
times a couple of months would 
go by without much expansion, 
sometimes half a dozen little buds 
would pop up in a week. 

No metallic object could get 
through them at all after the first 
week. Evidently the Sirians had 
decided that was their simplest 
defense. 

We tried non-metallic attacks, 



of course. We drifted poison gas 
and bacteria through them easily 
enough. But nothing happened 
as far as we could see ... as far 
as we could see was, after all, only 
the outermost skin of the bubble. 

A man could walk through — 
or most of the time he could — 
without feeling a thing, as long 
as he had taken off his wrist watch 
and laid down his gun. Not al- 
ways. I was in Camden when the 
5th Mountain Division sent in an 
attack with wooden spears and 
pottery grenades. Fifty men got 
through but the fifty-first bounced 
back, knocked unconscious, as 
though he’d hit a stone wall. I 
don’t know what happened to the 
fifty men who got through. The 
only thing I’m pretty sure of is 
that they didn’t much worry the 
bugs. 

Some people did come back. 
The Sirians threw them out, like 
Pinky’s missionary, Rocco. Prob- 
ably the Sirians had chosen types 
who would have little of impor- 
tance to tell, except how much 
they liked living under the Siri- 
ans. That’s what they told, every 
one of them. 

They were a problem to the 
Army. Most of them were soldiers, 
as it happened. The Army didn’t 
much like the idea of sending 
them back to their units, whose 
morale was already hanging low, 
so they put the missionaries in 
special battalions, along with the 



72 



GALAXY 



goof-offs and low-grade criminals, 
like Pinky Postal. 

Pinky heard the message of the 
missionaries loud and clear. He 
didn’t like the punishment battal- 
ion at all. 

He got his chance when he was 
handing out tetanus shots for a 
line of children and a jeep skidded 
in the slush, side-swiping the 
medics’ personnel carrier. The 
kids scattered like screaming 
geese. By the time the medic 
corporal got his detail rounded 
up again he had only five men 
instead of six. 

Pinky was in the back of a 
truck, heading south along the 
old Turnpike. Snow was driving 
down on him, but he was very 
happy. 

He had outsmarted the Army. 
They would look for him, but 
they would look North. It is al- 
ways easy to desert in the direc- 
tion of the enemy in wartime; the 
traffic is all the other way. 

He walked the last mile to the 
edge of the bubble, looming over 
him in the darkness like a green 
glass cliff. The snow was easing 
off and it was almost daylight as 
he stepped through. 

f T'HE Sirians never intended to 
destroy the Earth, only to own 
it. Pinky’s missionary was quite 
right. Almost at once they began 
breeding slaves. 

It was exactly the sort of job 



that Pinky would seek. He was 
not a bookish man, but he was 
immensely erudite on prurience. 
He knew very well what a breed- 
ing farm was like. There were the 
dozens of helpless, tamable does; 
and there was the big stud stal- 
lion, himself. What would be 
closer to the heart of any red- 
blooded boy? He made his way 
there, finally, very much elated. 
There were fifteen others in the 
shipment, all tall, heavy, muscu- 
lar men, all extremely cheerful. 
They rode in the back of an old 
Ford pickup truck, in warm sun- 
shine. They didn’t mind that it 
had a purplish tinge (green, 
Pinky would have thought, if he 
had thought about it at all; but 
the bubble reflected the green 
bands of the spectrum and what 
came through left the sun looking 
like a violet spotlight in the sky.) 
There were lavender clouds in 
a mauve sky, and all around them 
the bugs were busy with their re- 
construction. Snow-white ma- 
chines on wire-mesh treads were 
neatly paving over the rubble 
that had been a small Maryland 
town. “Bring on the girls,” bel- 
lowed Pinky, waving a bottle in 
one hand. It was only California 
sherry, but it was all he’d been 
able to find in the abandoned 
supermarket where they’d spent 
che night. 

“Man!” cried one of the other 
eager breeders. “Women!” Pinky. 



THE ABOMINABLE EARTHMAN

dropped the bottle in his excite- 
ment, staring. 

They were women, all right. 
They were flat on their backs on 
a grassy meadow, their legs in the 
air, pumping invisible bicycle 
pedals under the direction of a 
husky blonde girl. “Vun, two. 
T’ree, four! Vun, two. T’ree, four! 
All right, ladies. Now some bend- 
ing and stretching, hurry up, 
yoomp!" As the breeding stock 
clambered to its legs, Pinky ob- 
served that they had in fact al- 
ready been bred, some months 
before. It was only mildly disap- 
pointing. Where these were, there 
were bound to be others. 

The truck slowed and stopped, 
and Pinky saw his first Sirian. 

The creature was twelve feet 
high but flimsily constructed. It 
had a green carapace like a June 
bug’s, jointed in the center. It was 
not paying any attention to the 
snorting volunteer stallions. It 
stood on four hind legs, holding 
in its front pair of legs an instru- 
ment like a theodolite. (It had 
two smaller pairs of legs clasped 
across its olive-colored belly 
plate.) 

“Out! Everybody out!” bawled 
a man in a green brassard, circling 
respectfully around the Sirian 
toward the truck. “Nip along, 
you!” 

Pinky was first off, and first to 
reach the man in the green bras- 
sard. He had at'that time been in 



the bubble for less than thirty-six 
hours, but he knew who to butter 
up. Green brassards were over- 
seers. They were the human 
straw-bosses for the Sirians. “Ex- 
cuse me, sir. Say. I happened to 
get some good cigars last night, 
and I wondered if you . ?” 

r |^HE Sirians were not hard 
masters, but they were firm. 
They knew what they wanted in 
the way of a slave population — 
strength, size, stupidity — and it 
was only a detail that they found 
it necessary to kill some of those 
who gave them trouble. The 
trouble did not have to arise from 
viciousness. As Pinky Postal was 
entrenching himself with the man 
in the green brassard, one of the 
other candidate breeders made 
the mistake of gawking too close 
to the Sirian, who moved, which 
startled the captive, who brushed 
against the horny edge of green 
chiton at the Sirian’s tail. It was 
like green fire. The man did not 
even make a sound. Washed in a 
green blaze of light, he froze, 
straightened and fell dead. 

At about that time the first 
dead Sirian fell into our hands — 
partly because of Lt. Lauchhei- 
mer and myself — and we had a 
chance to discover what the green 
fire was. Not that it helped us. It 
was a natural defense, like the 
shock of an electric eel; electro- 
magnetic, at neural frequencies, it 



74 



GALAXY 



paralyzed life. Nothing else. It 
would not set off a match or stir 
a cobweb, but it would kill. 

Pinky did not know this, but 
he knew what he had already 
known, that the Sirians were 
deadly. Shaken, he waited for the 
physical examination. 

The overseer was not kind to 
Pinky because of the gift of ci- 
gars. He knew that kindness was 
not involved; it was a simple 
bribe. But as he shared Pinky’s 
code he repaid the bribe. He did 
not volunteer information, but he 
answered questions. Would all of 
them be kept for breeding stock? 
“God, no. Six jobs want to be 
filled, the rest of you go back.” 
Was there any special trick to 
passing the examination? The 
overseer jerked his thumb at a 
door labeled: Dr. Lessard. “Up to 
the doc.” And was it really what 
they said, inside, all girls and fun? 
The overseer laughed and walked 
away. There had only been two 
cigars. 

The doctor had overheard part 
of the conversation. He was hu- 
man, a dark little man with a 
dark little mustache. “I give you 
one piece of advice,” he said 
grimly, “stay away from Billings. 
What? Billings — him; the man 
you were talking to. He’s been 
working for the bugs since they 
landed in Australia.” 

Pinky said, “But aren’t you 
working for them?” The doctor 



did not answer, unless the extra, 
unnecessary twist of the blood- 
sampling needle was an answer. 
There were a lot like the doctor 
in the bubbles — policemen, doc- 
tors, a few elected officials of 
towns, who saw only one duty and 
that was to continue at their jobs. 
They worked for the bugs, but 
not as Billings did. 

Twenty minutes later the doc- 
tor had completed his blood tests. 
“Do I pass?” Pinky demanded 
eagerly. “You know, do I get to 
breed?” 

The doctor looked at him 
thoughtfully. 

Abruptly he laughed. He 
erased a little mark on the paper 
and substituted another. “I think 
you do,” he said. 

Pinky didn’t understand the 
doctor’s laughter for several 
hours. 

Then the five of the lot who 
had been selected were led into 
a long, narrow, white room with 
a bank of refrigerators against 
one wall and a remarkable quan- 
tity of test-tubes, flasks, glass tub- 
ing and other chemical-looking 
instruments on benches against 
the other. The five potent studs 
stared at each other, until a sour- 
faced human male, wearing a lab- 
oratory smock, came reluctantly 
in to start them on their duties. 

There was a storm of questions; 
the man said, “Oh, shut up, all of 
you. I hate this job.”

"V/f EANWHILE there was a war 
on, and we were losing it. 

I don’t know all the battles that 
were fought, I only know we 
didn’t win them. I saw the atomic 
cannon on Cape Cod, I heard 
about the George Washington’s 
attempt to penetrate the Atlantic 
Coast bubble, which resulted in 
its flooding and sinking in a hun- 
dred fathoms of water. We heard 
that the Russians had managed to 
penetrate with a plywood missile, 
built with a ceramic skin and 
guided by a human kamikaze vol- 
unteer. There was a latrine rumor 
that the Canadians got through 
with a whole squadron of gliders. 
But whatever results were 
achieved were invisible from out- 
side the bubbles. 

The one small victory that 
went to the human race came 
through Lt. Lauchheimer and my- 
self. We buried ourselves in a 
little cave off a railroad tunnel, 
just outside Worcester, Massa- 
chusetts. We were there four 
weeks before the Sirians got 
around to expanding the bubble 
to include us. They finally did; 
and the gamble paid off. 

We were inside the bubble with 
a live bomb. 

According to Intelligence, its 
information derived from correla- 
ting the accounts of returned mis- 
sionaries, our target was a Sirian 
scout vessel in the mathematical 
center of the sphere; blow that

up, and the bubble would burst. 
We did. It did. We traveled at 
night and never saw a Sirian. At 
night the bubble was a wet-look- 
ing, faintly luminous lavender 
shroud. Lauchheimer had a porta- 
ble electronic gizmo which trian- 
gulated the center for us. We 
found the center, located the ship, 
fused the bomb, had an hour to 
get away, did . and saw, in the 
first rays of the morning sun, a 
great mushrooming cloud that 
rose into a blue, bubble-free sky. 

Paratroopers captured four live 
Sirians; eight others were found 
dead from the blast. 

That was what gave Lauch- 
heimer and me our Congressional 
Medals. 

The hostages didn’t stay with 
us very long. They were brought 
to Washington too, for study. Ten 
minutes after we got our Medals 
— flicker, whine — there was a 
sudden surge of color and a dis- 
tant sound; the sun outside the 
White House window went pur- 
ple and we were all caught. 

Some months after that I found 
myself sharing a kennel with 
Pinky Postal. 

Ill 

T HAD NOT expected to see him 
there, though I suppose I 
could have guessed it. I knew 
more than he, though. I knew that 
the Sirians’ idea of breeding was 



by no means the joyous sport that 
had inspired troubadors and axe- 
killings for thousands of years. 
After all, we use artificial insemi- 
nation on our domestic animals, 
why should the Sirians be less 
efficient? 

I knew enough, in fact, to have 
tried to avoid the breeding farm, 
for more reasons than one. Des- 
tiny makes games of our inten- 
tions; I was selected out of a 
thousand casual laborers in the 
work camp near Bethesda, and 
trucked to the farm overnight. 

Pinky was thin, pale, trembling. 
He recognized me at once. “Help 
me, Harry! I got to get out of 
this place.” 

I looked around the place. It 
had been the Bethesda Naval 
Hospital at one time, with 
changes made by the bugs. It was 
now one enormous lying-in home, 
with beds for eighteen hundred 
women, dormitories for thousands 
more in the grounds around, and 
a special small detention home 
for we fortunate donors. “You got 
what you wanted, didn’t you?” I 
said. 

Pinky had lost forty pounds, 
and there was no more flesh on 
his arms than on a spider crab’s, 
but he surprised me. Without a 
word he jumped at my throat. 

I beat him off with difficulty. 
“All right! It was a joke.” 

He slumped in a heap, whining, 
“Oh, Harry! I been here fourteen 



78

months and one of the bug boys 
tells me I have a hundred and 
twenty-three kids already, and 
more on the way, and — And, I 
swear, the closest I’ve been to a 
woman is looking at them out the 
window. You know what? 
They’ve got some of my — 
They’ve got samples, you know, 
in the deep freeze. They could 
kill me tomorrow and I’d go 
right on having kids for maybe 
twenty years. Harry! I didn’t 
know it would be like this at all.” 
I left him and looked out the 
window. There was an exercise 
yard, a mess hall, a community 
shower — and a wall. Donors 
were not allowed outside of it. 

I said, “You ought to feel hon- 
ored. There are only ten of these 
stud farms in the world.” 

“And they’re all the same — 
all this artificial insemination?” 
“All exactly the same, Pinky. 
I’m sorry.” That was a lie, of 
course — about being sorry; why 
would anyone waste compassion 
on Pinky Postal? But I was com- 
mitted to telling lies. I could not 
trust him with the truth. 

“Maybe it will work out all 
right,” I said vaguely, reassuring 
not him but myself. 

It had to. Something had to. 
Of the twenty-five of us who were 
abruptly sworn in as intelligence 
officers when the bubble closed in 
over Washington — the last real 
hope of any organized effort 



against the bugs — I was pretty 
sure that I was the only survivor. 

nPHE only hope of accomplish- 
ing anything against the Siri- 
ans lay in the possibility of de- 
stroying their central high com- 
mand which was not a Sirian, or 
at any rate not an organic Sirian, 
but a machine. A computer. It did 
not rue them, but it detailed their 
plans. 

There was a chance, said the 
general who swore us in, that if 
we destroyed the computer they 
would be confused and weakened, 
then we might get at them with 
conventional arms. 

I followed Pinky’s example 
and made friends with the man 
in the green brassard, Billings. I 
had no cigars. “I want to help 
you,” I told him. 

“My oath.” He sat down with 
contempt and lit a cigarette with 
loathing. “You chaps get queerer 
every day.” ' 

I wheedled, “You never know, 
Billings. They might put you on 
stud any day.” 

“Too true.” But it had shaken 
him. “And what can you do to 
stop them?” 

I built a dream castle for him. 
“I have something they want, Bill- 
ings. I can tell you about some- 
thing the bugs will want to know.” 

Scornfully:- “Hell! There isn’t 
anything they want to know. 
They’ve a shootin’ big machine 



THE ABOMINABLE EARTHMAN 



79 



that tells them everything they 
need.” 

“But the machine only knows 
what it’s told. There’s something 
the bugs have never known to 
tell it.” 

He looked impresed for a mo- 
ment. “Dinkum? But — ” Then he 
shook his head. Casually he 
flicked ashes on my shoe. “I 
know what you’re up to. You fel- 
lows are always coming to me 
with crook stories about how this 
is going to help me and that’s 
going to save my life. It’s no good. 
You can’t fool me, cobber. And if 
you could, I can’t fool them.” 

I said persuasively, “Let me 
try, won’t you? It’s a matter of 
human nature.” 

“What is?” 

“What information they’ve 
given the computer. You were 
caught in the first landing, weren’t 
you? Don’t you remember what 
happened? They took a hundred 
men and women and subjected 
them to tests; the results made 
up a profile of human psychology 
for their computer.” He nodded, 
watching me. “But they didn’t 
have a Pinky Postal.” 

jOILLINGS said positively, “I 
don’t know what the hell 
you’re talking about.” 

But gradually I worked him 
over. I had to. Pinky was my 
ticket to the Sirian central head- 
quarters. What I could accom- 



plish there I did not know, but I 
knew that nothing at all could be 
accomplished on the stud farm. 
Besides, the argument was plaus- 
ible — if not to Billings, then it 
would be to a Sirian. For what 
I had said was true. Their data 
was biased in favor of decent hu- 
man beings, for their first captives 
were those who stood and fought. 
“Sure you know what you’re 
talking about, pal?” 

“I’m sure.” 

“You’re not just sore because 
they wouldn’t let you in with the 
sheilas?” 

“I’m looking for a way out of 
here, Billings. That’s all. Think 
it over. You’ll see I’m right. 
They’ll reward you.” 

He looked at me with contemp- 
tuous eyes. “You don’t know much 
about them, do you? But prob- 
ably they won’t hurt me. Worth 
a try, no doubt. .” He said 
thoughtfully: “They’ll be wild as 
cut snakes if this isn’t right. And 
I’ll be wild at you.” But he finally 
gave in. 

Pinky was pathetic in his grati- 
tude. I was his only friend. He 
would never forget me; and, say, 
come to think of it, I was getting 
a break out of this too, wasn’t I? 
How about giving him first pick 
of the food, for instance, or would 
I rather that he told the Sirians 
he couldn’t react properly to their 
tests with me along? 

He was reacting exactly prop- 



80 



GALAXY 



erly, of course. But the trouble 
was the Sirians had their own 
ideas. Billings brought us down 
to the big barn where the only 
Sirian for miles around sometimes 
stopped by to check performance 
at the stud farm and, after waiting 
for some hours, the Sirian ap- 
peared. Billings, trembling, tried 
to explain what it was I had said. 
The Sirian grasped the idea very 
quickly; my promise was kept; 
the Sirian took the bait. He said 
something into a small spherical 
contraption he wore dangling 
from one middle leg and in a 
moment there was a Sirian plane, 
and Pinky and Billings were 
herded into it. 

Just them. Not me. 

For me it was back to the stud 
farm. Pinky had been my ticket 
to the headquarters and the ticket 
had just been punched. 

r pHE main Sirian headquarters 
on North America was in 
Maryland, on the site of what had 
once been the Bowie race track. 
Off to the south lay the horse 
barns. Where the grandstand and 
track itself had been, now trace- 
lessly slagged over, stood the 
Sirian construction that they had 
flung up around their ship. 

The building looked like a 
castle, worked like a palace. A 
palace is more than a home; it is 
workshop and office, an adminis- 
trative center; so was this. But 



it did have a resemblance to a 
medieval castle, at least from a 
great enough distance in the air. 
There were things like towers and 
things like battlements. Closer up 
the resemblance was gone. The 
lobed wall that surrounded it was 
not for defense, as in a castle; it 
was the Sirian equivalent of a 
garage, where their ground and 
air vehicles were kept. The towers 
were viewless, except at the very 
top, where sweeping silvery nee- 
dles performed a function like 
radar’s. 

Pinky and the Aussie came to 
it with suspicion and delight. Any- 
thing was better than the stud 
farm. 

Or almost anything. But un- 
deniably this was queer. They 
were sent to a hexagonal green- 
on-green room, small, bedless. 
Billings spat on the floor when he 
saw it. But even that satisfaction 
was denied him. The floor shim- 
mered, the saliva collected in 
quicksilvery beads and trembled 
toward an almost invisible slit, 
where it vanished. Pinky said, 
“You don’t like the accommoda- 
tions?” 

“It ain’t Darling Point,” said 
Billings. “You know what I wish? 
I wish that pal of yours was here. 
I’ve a notion of something I want 
to say to him.” 

But Billings had only been a 
strawboss at the stud farm, Pinky 
had actually been one of the 



THE ABOMINABLE EARTHMAN 



81 



studs. “It’s not so bad,” he said 
with cheerful confidence, “and 
anyway we’ll make out. Or I will.” 
He hesitated and said: “You 
won’t believe this, but I wish 
there were some women here.” 

The Sirians wasted no time. 
Considering the limitations placed 
on their researches by the lack of 
unimpeded communication (no 
human ever learned the Sirian 
speech, and they could manage 
human tongues only through a 
sort of vodor), they were thor- 
ough and complete. None of it 
made much sense to Pinky, of 
course. All he knew was that he 
and Billings were bored, annoyed 
and persecuted for twelve hours 
at a time with endless nibbling 
nuisances. Word associations, re- 
flex tests, interpretive depth 
studies much like a Rorschach — 
the works. “There’s not much in 
being a guinea pig,” sighed Bill- 
ings, exhausted and angry. 

“Would you rather be a stud?” 
asked Pinky, very cheerfully. He 
was quite happy. He had dis- 
covered an angle to shoot. 

IV 

nPHE heart of the Sirian head- 
quarters was a room thirty 
feet tall, a hundred feet square, 
lighted with a sourceless green 
glow and inhabited at all times 
by several dozen of the bugs. 

Pinky had seen the room from 



a gallery above it. The results of 
his tests and Billing’s were fed 
into receptors in a little room just 
off the great one. It was there, 
banked like a horseshoe along 
three walls, that the central com- 
puter whispered and glowed. 

The Sirians did not trouble 
with electricity in its grosser 
forms. The computers operated 
on what seemed to be neural im- 
pulses, projecting their data on 
soft green-ivory breast-shaped 
bosses in letters of light. There is 
very much about those computers 
which is mysterious, but some 
things are sure: For one, at least 
a hundred problems could be 
worked and answered simultane- 
ously, so that the feat of juggling 
Pinky’s personality quirks into 
the standard human profile could 
go on whenever convenient to the 
bugs, without interrupting the cal- 
culation of Hohmann trajectories 
for the remainder of their fleet 
(then approaching Orbit Pluto), 
the logistics of their Canadian en- 
terprise, the setting of breeding 
quotas and the computation of 
field strengths for each bubble in 
their chain. 

Not all of the answers were ex- 
pressed numerically; some were 
translated directly into action in 
their factories; some were ex- 
pressed visually. In the center of 
the room, for instance, was what 
(although Pinky could not have 
recognized it) was a situation 



82 



GALAXY 



map. The chart was of North 
America, but as the human con- 
vention of portraying bodies of 
water as featureless plains was 
not followed by the Sirians, Pinky 
could make of it nothing but a 
scramble of topography, as mean- 
ingless to him as the chart of the 
back side of the Moon. 

If Pinky had had the wit to 
understand what he saw even he 
might have been shocked. The 
circles of Sirian bubbles were 
etched in fire. They had grown — 
how they had grown! All the 
Eastern seaboard was a string of 
fat Sirian beads now, and a 
beaded limb swung west as far as 
the featureless plain of Ohio. The 
last quick sproutings of bubbles 
had taken in and neutralized four 
Army Corps areas, eight SAC 
bases, the manufacturing centers 
of most of the eastern half of the 
continent and every center of 
population of importance north of 
Savannah and east of the Great 
Lakes. There was very little left. 

Pinky Postal saw all that with- 
out comprehending. Or caring. 

What he comprehended very 
clearly was that in the hours 
when he was not under scrutiny 
he was allowed to do as he liked. 

The Sirians were not careless, 
they were merely confident. They 
had every reason to be. The few 
hundred humans at liberty within 
the headquarters had no weapons. 
All of them combined were no 



match for a single bug, who could 
effortlessly destroy them one 
after another at will. There was 
little prospect of effective sabo- 
tage in the areas available to the 
captives. Most rooms were fea- 
tureless dormitories, halls, exer- 
cise areas, yards. The workshops 
and armories were closed to 
humans. The few chambers which 
had any strategic importance — 
principally the computer room — 
were never left untended. 

Pinky restlessly prowled the 
headquarters and the abandoned 
human buildings surrounding it. 
He found treasures — in the old 
jockey’s quarters, a wicker basket 
of champagne; in the Steward’s 
office, a tin box full of money. 

He waved the hundred-dollar 
bills in Billing’s face, but the Aus- 
sie only snarled, “What’s the use 
of that?” 

“Oh, cheer up,” said Pinky dis- 
passionately. “What’s the use of 
anything? But money’s always 
good. You’ll see.” 

“I’ll see we’ll spend the rest of 
our lives whingeing about here,” 
groaned Billings. He had become 
very morose. He almost stopped 
eating and, as days passed, 
stopped speaking. In the tests he 
failed to cooperate. 

Not Pinky. Pinky was a model 
of cooperation. He had learned 
that the way to get along with the 
bugs was to do what they wanted, 
and he was not surprised when 



THE ABOMINABLE EARTHMAN 



83 



one night as the tests were con- 
cluded Billings was detained. 
Pinky walked slowly toward their 
room, and did not even look back 
when from behind him he caught 
a flash of silent green light and 
heard a sharp, panicky sound 
from Billings, then silence. Too 
bad. But Pinky had his plans. 

BY THEN I was in the hills 
around Frederick, Maryland, 
with the freedom forces. 

Well, we called ourselves that, 
for morale mostly; but actually 
my work lay mostly in nurse- 
maiding chitinous young Waldo, 
our ace of trumps. 

I had not escaped from the 
breeding farm, I had been liber- 
ated. A fire and noise woke us 
donors one night; we saw human 
figures dancing around the flame 
of burning buildings, and in the 
confusion the raiders broke into 
our close-penned corral and led 
us away. It was none too soon for 
me, and I was not only grateful, 
I was astonished. For these were 
free men and women living under 
the bubbles! 

It was inconceivable, but there 
they were. 

Undoubtedly the Sirians could 
have hunted us down, but they 
didn’t bother. Probably there 
were too many humans loose 
under their screens, like silverfish 
in an old house. They had ways 
of locating weapons as long as 



there was a metallic component 
like the barrel of a gun or shaft 
of a knife — magnetic or elec- 
tronic detectors, no doubt — but 
while we kept free of metal they 
never troubled us. 

So our weapon was the torch. 

We killed bugs, too. We fried a 
dozen one night in firing a stand 
of yellow pine where they were 
— I don’t know; perhaps camping. 
We clubbed a few, killed some 
from a distance with bow and 
arrow. Strike and run, we must 
have destroyed fifty of them in 
six months. That was not a small 
number. It was more than one 
per cent of all the Sirians on 
Earth. 

It was relatively easy for us to 
move about because the expand- 
ing bubbles had swept so much 
of the human race ahead of them. 
The towns were deserted. The 
bug centers were easy to avoid. 
All of North America was now 
under the green umbrella; a 
mauve sun sailed over all of 
Europe and most of Asia. We 
learned, through such sparse com- 
munications facilities as were left 
to us, that Africa and South 
America were largely bug-free. 
Evidently the warmer parts of the 
Earth were not attractive to the 
Sirians. They were now a sort of 
game preserve, nearly all that 
survived of humanity packed 
into those two continents, almost 
two billion people crowded into 



84 



GALAXY 



the malarial Amazon basin and 
the hot savannahs of the Congo. 

So we crept about under their 
feet and stung them when we 
could. We became ingenious in 
setting snares. With the high- 
octane gasoline from an aban- 
doned storage tank we washed 
one of their landing strips one 
night, and set it ablaze just as 
one of their gull-winged flyers 
came in. The intention was to in- 
cinerate them all, and then for us 
to vanish tracelessly; but the Siri- 
an pilot saw danger at the last 
moment and almost soared free. 
The flames caught him, and the 
ship pinwheeled into the side of a 
hill. And that was very fortunate 
for us, because that was how we 
captured Waldo. 

T¥7ALDO was a small, dark- 
green creature the size of a 
puppy, newly hatched and not 
very dangerous. 

He was our first living Sirian 
captive. We dared take time to 
poke about in the wreck of the 
plane, knowing that there would 
be investigation, and we found 
that only two of its crew were 
adult Sirians; the others were 
eggs or hatchlings. The crash had 
killed them handsomely. All but 
one. John Gaffney found the one; 
rummaging through the dark he 
suddenly screamed: “The little 
louse! He bit me!” But it wasn’t 
a bite, it was a neural shock. It 



was Waldo. He was alive. As he 
was only a newborn, his shock 
was painful but not deadly. 

We roped him and dragged 
him out onto the side of the hill. 
In the light of a quarter million 
burning gallons of gasoline, 
pinned on his back with ten legs 
waving, he did not seem danger- 
ous, only comic. “Kill him,” said 
Gaffney, rubbing his leg. 

“No.” I had a better idea. 
“They’ll never miss him. Why 
don’t we keep him? He can be — 
We can use him for — ” 

“What?” demanded Gaffney. 
“No, kill him!” But I had my way 
finally. We had no plan for a 
captive Sirian, because it had 
never occurred to us we might 
catch one. But surely something 
would turn up! 

So we swung him in a ham- 
mock and lashed him tight, and 
we got out of there minutes before 
the Sirian rescue parties were 
circling the sea of flame. 

It was months before we had 
any idea of what to do with him. 
As I had insisted on kidnapping 
him, he was given me to raise. 
This was not pleasant. He was a 
painful pet, and difficult to 
handle. 

I mention only the difficulty of 
feeding him. Infant Sirians were 
nurtured on a sort of nectar, 
probably once secreted by Sirian 
adults but now, in their dwellings, 
synthesized in quantity. We had 



THE ABOMINABLE EARTHMAN 



85 



none. We tried everything. Honey 
was good but hard to come by. 
Molasses made him drunk. Sim- 
ple sugar solution he refused to 
touch. We finally settled on maple 
syrup with, after experimenting, 
a few drops of whiskey. 

On this he thrived. I deter- 
mined to try to teach him Eng- 
lish. 

I could not hope that he would 
ever speak it, but neither can a 
dog. He was much brighter than 
a dog. “Walk,” “sit,” “come” — 
he learned those before he was 
a month old. He showed that he 
could learn much more. 

In the winter evenings he 
would cuddle in my lap and we 
would look at the pictures in 
magazines together, I pointing 
out “car” and “house” and “wash- 
ing machine” and Waldo reaching 
out with a jointed, taloned leg to 
scratch at the picture on the 
page. He made a faint humming 
sound, and his hardening chiton 
was rather warm. I grew almost 
fond of him, he was so eager to 
learn. Yet I was kept from over- 
sentimentality by the potent sting 
he carried with him always. He 
would fall asleep in my lap. Just 
as a human child will restlessly 
turn over a time or two before 
drifting off, so Waldo would emit 
one sleepy shock before the black, 
hard eyes unfocused and he went 
into the catalepsy that was their 
sleep. 



As he grew larger (and he grew 
astonishingly fast), those light 
love-pats in good night became 
more and more agonizing. Twice 
I was knocked unconscious. 

We tried insulation. We 
wrapped him in rubber sheets, 
shrouded him in layer on layer 
of quilts. We tried keeping him 
off my lap, merely close by on a 
couch. Nothing worked. Always 
he drowsily reached out with one 
leg or an eyestalk or the corner 
of his backplate, just before he 
drifted off. And I leaped half out 
of my skin. 

(TKN CHRISTMAS day of the 
second year of the Sirian con- 
quest, Gaffney brought us a new 
recruit. 

I was not present when she 
arrived — I was out exercising 
Waldo, under the shelter of an 
overgrown old apple orchard — 
and I missed the questioning. By 
the time I got back to our camp 
she was asleep, worn out, but 
Gaffney was bubbling with news. 

“She was actually in their 
headquarters! She drew us a plan 
of the whole thing, Harry — look!” 
It was crude, but if the girl was 
reliable it was all the information 
we had hoped for. We located the 
computer room, the Sirian sleep- 
ing quarters, the defensive instal- 
lations, the shops, the laboratories. 
Slave quarters ringed one floor. 
Surveillance of half a continent 



86 



GALAXY 



was carried on in an observatory 
near the top. “And look here,” 
said Gaffney in excitement, “see 
this line? The inner part of the 
headquarters is almost independ- 
ent of the rest. Double walls, 
limited access, construction heav- 
ier, stronger inside. What does 
that suggest?” I opened my 
mouth. “A ship!” he cried, not 
giving me a chance, “the central 
part of the building is a ship!” 

More than that, the girl had 
told him that that ship housed 
all the brains of the Sirian expedi- 
tion. They had but one computer; 
it had landed with the first touch- 
down on Australia, but had been 
moved to the United States. If 
we could destroy that ship. 

“But that’s the part that wor- 
ries me,” admitted Gaffney, down- 
cast. “How do we get in? They 
let her wander about pretty much 
as she wanted, see — all the hu- 
mans do. Fact, the humans are 
pretty much independent, long as 
they do what the bugs want. Even 
have their own, well, boss, a fel- 
low who — Never mind. What I 
started out to say, the bugs can 
afford to let the humans roam 
around, because the corridors are 
booby-trapped. It’s something 
like Waldo’s shock. There are 
places where this girl couldn’t go, 
because she would die, unless a 
Sirian was with her. It didn’t 
bother Sirians.” 

We puzzled that over for a 



while. Waldo, beside me, rested 
one talon gently in my hand — 
he was very well behaved and 
quite trustworthy except, as I 
said, just as he was drifting off 
to sleep. He loomed over us (be- 
ing now more than nine feet tall), 
staring at the scribbled map with 
polite curiosity. 

I turned and stared at him ab- 
ruptly. “Waldo! He could help 
us!” Quickly I explained. If Siri- 
ans could pass the booby-traps, 
why, we had our own Sirian! 

I said, “We’ll have to ask the 
girl. Did they carry anything 
special? But she would have said 
so, and I think not. I think prob- 
ably their own neural shock ema- 
nations screened off the radiations 
from the booby traps, and if that’s 
the case — ” 

“Don’t guess,” said Gaffney. 
“We’ve woke her up with all our 
noise. Here she comes now.” 

And there was the girl, coming 
drowsily into the room. She 
glanced toward me, stopped stark, 
her hand flew to her mouth, she 
screamed. 

I threw a look at Waldo beside 
me. 

“Oh, you saw him? Don’t worry 
about him, young lady! He’s per- 
fectly tame. But no doubt he re- 
minded you of the horrors you 
suffered while the captive of the 
Sirians. .” 

She simmered down slowly, 
shaking her head. “No — no. I’m 



THE ABOMINABLE EARTHMAN

sorry to be such a fool. It isn’t 
the bug I was worried about. It’s 
just that seeing you standing there 
that way, so close to him — well. 
You scared me half to death. For 
a minute,” she said with apolo- 
getic embarrassment, “for a 
minute I thought you were the 
boss. Mr. Postal.” 

V 

TT'ARTH had now been con- 
quered in all of its important 
parts. We knew that the great 
colonizing fleet that would follow 
the first wave had long been orbit- 
ing the sun, reducing its velocity, 
knocking off miles-per-second to 
match speed with the Earth and 
to land. 

What we did not know was 
how tedious life had become for 
the conquerors. 

Pinky Postal, however, had 
them right under his eye. He saw 
how little there was for them to 
do. These were soldiers, not in- 
tellectuals, not artists, not even 
home-builders; their work was to 
fight, and they were fought out. 
They had won. 

Two days before Billings was 
killed, Pinky caught a glimpse of 
what might be. He found five 
quarts of champagne and got 
quite drunk. In his intoxication he 
blundered where he knew he 
should not go — into Sirian quar- 
ters — and it was only the provi- 



dence of drunks that kept him 
from a booby trap, but somehow 
he found himself in a small room, 
where something heaved under a 
tarpaulin. 

It was a queer sight, and he 
kicked it. 

The tarpaulin flung free. There 
was a high-pitched Sirian chirp, 
and three great insect bodies 
bounded up from the floor, where 
they had been huddled. Gravely, 
drunkenly, Pinky realized that he 
was about to die. He had caught 
them at something, heaven knew 
what. And they would surely 
smite him low. 

As he was drunk, he merely 
stood there, weaving slightly, 
breathing calm alcoholic defiance 
at the Sirian who bent dangerous- 
ly toward him. 

— But he did not die. 

He did not die, and the next 
morning, through the pounding 
haze of his hangover, he wondered 
why. There were blanks in his 
recollection. But he remembered 
standing there, and he remem- 
bered that the killing bolt from 
the Sirian had never come. 

He puzzled over it for a whole 
day. 

Then, that evening, a Sirian 
came toward him and bent low. 

Pinky was not drunk this time, 
and he was terrified. He tried to 
run, fell, squirmed and lay flat on 
his back while the great flat June- 
bug face swooped down at him. 



88 



GALAXY 



Again the bolt did not strike. 

The face hung there, for 
seconds and then for minutes. 
And by and by Pinky saw that 
the Sirian was twitching. It 
twitched and stirred. Then it de- 
finitely staggered. It stumbled, 
caught itself, almost fell athwart 
him, caught itself again. The faint 
cricket-chirp sounded, ragged and 
. and . drunken. 

Drunken! 

And Pinky, sleepless that night, 
staring at the black ceiling of his 
green-on-green cubicle, realized 
that he had found what he 
wanted. 

He became a pusher. Of him- 
self. 

/"VF course the Sirians had their 
vices. What creature does 

not? 

Carbon dioxide was their 
liquor. Their respiratory systems 
being what they were, it was only 
infrequently that their own waste 
gases reached their intake ori- 
fices; but the concentrated breath 
of a mammal could send them 
reeling; a few minutes inhaling 
a man’s direct breath would stiff- 
en them in a giggling paralysis. 

But on their planet of Sirius, 
they had no mammals. 

They did what they could with 
what they had to work with. Their 
most secret vice was bundling — 
two (or, rarely and most despic- 
ably, three or more) of the Siri- 



ans furtively huddled under an 
airtight sheet, exuding COo and 
intoxicating one another. It was 
a fearful vice. It was also a dan- 
gerous one. It could not be prac- 
ticed openly. And when done in 
secret there was always the risk 
that the drunks would pass out 
and ultimately die of hyperintoxi- 
cation. 

They were not merely drupks, 
they were alcoholics, a racial 
characteristic; for once they had 
tasted the happy-gas exuded by 
gross mammalian chemistry they 
were addicts. Pinky collected his 
first addict by chance, but he was 
courageous enough and thought- 
ful enough to make more. It took 
courage. It took exposing himself 
to a chance bolt from a new con- 
tact, but once the first few mo- 
ments were past, so was the 
danger. A new habit had been 
formed; the pusher had hooked 
a new customer. It was the sort 
of industrious empire-building to 
which Pinky was best fitted, for 
he was perceptive to all weak- 
nesses of the flesh — even chiti- 
nous flesh hatched under alien, 
blue-white stars. 

Pinky was supply enough for 
whole roomfuls of Sirians, such 
clouds of intoxicant wafted from 
him. As days and weeks passed, 
more and more the work of the 
Sirian headquarters came to re- 
volve around him. The business 
of occupying Earth tended itself 



THE ABOMINABLE EARTHMAN 



89 



well enough. The quasi-radars 
kept their vigil and marked their 
targets, the computers never 
stopped monitoring the approach 
of the fleet and correcting its 
course. They gave him a vodor, 
so that he could talk to them 
direct; he talked in commands. 
They obeyed his commands, for 
he was intelligent enough to bait 
them. He sent them on scroung- 
ing expeditions to find choice 
food — a good bargain for them 
for, as with Earthly topers, it was 
not the simple chemical paralysis 
that pleased them best but the 
subtle bouquet and tang of con- 
taminants. What bliss in the reek 
of green onions on his breath! 
What tingling thrill in the stale 
scent of tobacco! They sent par- 
ties rummaging through the near- 
by abandoned towns, for canned 
cheese and garlic, for spearmint 
chewing gum and cinnamon 
drops. 

Food and drink supplied, he 
next demanded control over the 
other humans in the Sirian head- 
quarters. This too they gave him 
— why not? It was Pinky, after 
all, who knew how to brew those 
rare blends of flavor that made 
all the difference. If Pinky chose 
to exercise the human crew in 
ways of his own, he never failed 
to share their breath with his em- 
ployers. For this reason the other 
humans grew to hate, fear and 
despise him, but they feared the 



Sirians even more. Pinky was per- 
fectly happy for the first time in 
his life. He was not a king, he 
was more. 

The Sirians ruled the world. 
And, in all but name, he ruled 
the Sirians. 

It was into this earthly paradise 
of Pinky’s that we snakes wrig- 
gled, bringing destruction. 

HPHE rest is history: How, em- 
■*- boldened by the increasing 
laxity of the Sirians, we attacked 
their headquarters; how Waldo, a 
happy child with no consciousness 
that he was betraying his race, 
led us through the trapped corri- 
dors into the Sirian fortress; how 
we were found out by that most 
Sirian of tyrants, Pinky Postal. 
For it was he who spotted us. He 
and his humans had ministered to 
the whole headquarters detach- 
ment, leaving them in a happy 
stupor, when the alarm bells rang, 
and though Pinky roused one of 
the bugs enough to locate us, the 
creature was far too tipsy to do 
anything about it. 

It was the end of the world for 
Pinky Postal. His paradise was 
over. 

He confronted us at the en- 
trance passage, wild with fear and 
hate. 

“Harry!” he bawled, screeching 
with rage. “You louse! You rat! 
You human!” 

“Shut up,” said I, and in truth 



90 



GALAXY 



I paid him little attention. I was 
wondering where the Sirians 
were. We didn’t then know that 
they were all dead drunk, or al- 
most all; we thought they might 
come ravening down among us 
with murderous shocks blazing 
left and right. Pinky danced be- 
fore us, almost weeping; but when 
we deployed left and right, as we 
had rehearsed it so many times, 
he bolted away and, crash, a steel 
door slammed behind him. 

We invested the outer shell of 
the Sirian structure with no 
trouble at all. It was all too easy, 
in fact. It turned out to be costly. 
Fifteen of us died in the Sirian 
takeoff. 

Yes, the Sirian takeoff — which 
so many have wondered at — 
now the truth can be told. Two of 
Pinky Postal’s retinue at the 
last, when they saw what was 
happening, fled with only seconds 
to spare back to the Earth Pinky 
was spurning. They told us how 
Pinky, raving, strove to arouse 
the bugs to destroy us; failing, 
tried to get them to lock us out; 
failing even in that, managed at 
the last only to sober one Sirian 
just enough to pull the master 
switches that blasted their ship 
loose from its shell, sending it 
screaming up, out and away, Siri- 
ans, computer, Pinky and all. 

Fifteen of our raiding party 
died in its rocket-flames. It was 
a cheap price, of course. 



But how are we to explain to 
history that the Sirian conquest 
of humanity was defeated not by 
our strength but by our vices? 

A ND when it comes to that, 
J -*- what can I say to the Presi- 
dent? 

He is very sunburned and 
healthy looking from his summer 
on the Orinoco. He is a titan at 
the tasks of reconstruction. Life is 
almost normal again; and he as- 
sures me that, with what we have 
learned from the works the Siri- 
ans left behind, we shall have no 
trouble in fighting off their in- 
vasion if they dared to attempt it 
again. They left a hundred bubble 
generators, and now we know how 
to pierce any bubble. We have 
already mopped up their survi- 
vors. Young Waldo is busy every 
day, trying to learn to talk to his 
own kind and tell them that they 
have lost a war. 

Naturally, the President wants 
to reward the man who made all 
this possible — at, says the Presi- 
dent with sorrow and pride, the 
cost of his own dear life. 

I wish I could stop it, but I 
don’t know how. I don’t mind, 
really, that mine should not be 
the last Congressional Medal of 
Honor after all. 

But I resent it most keenly that 
the next should go in absentia to 
Pinky Postal!

BY WILLY LEY 
THE HOME-MADE LAND 

W HEN I, in January 1935, 
spent two days of sight- 
seeing in London, a man 
who showed me around one morn- 
ing proudly said: “My people 
built this city.” Westminster Ab- 
bey and the Houses of Parliament 
looked very beautiful in the 
morning sunlight of that clear 
day and I fully understood how 
he felt. But aside from that he 
was simply speaking the truth, 
cities don’t happen by themselves. 
I heard a similar statement 



92 



GALAXY 



many years later near Phoenix, 
Arizona, when I was shown areas 
made fertile by irrigation. The 
man said: “We made this desert 
into land.” 

But a Dutchman — and only 
a Dutchman — could go farther. 
He could point to an endless 
meadow, or even just to a map 
of his country, and declare: “We 
made this land!” He could even 
add: “And we’ll make more.” 

The Kingdom of The Nether- 
lands, to give it its proper name, 
has an area of 12,500 square 
miles, as any almanac will tell 
you. What the almanac usually 
does not say is that if The Nether- 
lands were “untouched by human 
hands” some 6800 square miles 
would be under water at high tide, 
and would thus be uninhabitable 
because the salty water of the 
North Sea, if nothing else, would 
ruin all edible crops. 

The Dutch have literally made 
half of their land themselves. 
Though the history of The Neth- 
erlands has its share of wars, the 
main enemy since 1200 A.D. has 
been the North Sea. 

The main battleground was the 
area of the two provinces of 
North Holland and South Hol- 
land. North Holland is the area 
to the north of the old university 
town of Leiden (after which the 
Leiden, or Leyden, jars are 
named), with Amsterdam in its 
approximate center. The next 



largest Dutch city, Rotterdam, is 
the approximate center of South 
Holland. 

To the south of South Holland 
we have the Province of Zeeland, 
consisting almost exclusively of 
islands. (The Dutch captain Abel 
Janszoon Tasman bestowed the 
name of his native province on 
islands about as far away from 
Zeeland as one can be, when 
staying on the same planet. This 
is how New Zealand got its 
name.) Zeeland is the current bat- 
tleground, as we’ll see; the battle 
of Holland is all but won. It mere- 
ly needs consolidation. 

T^HE watery geography of the 
-* 1 - provinces of Holland and Zee- 
land is determined by three rivers, 
all of which have their sources 
outside the country. The north- 
ernmost of the three is the Rhine 
which, as it enters Dutch territory, 
changes its name to Waal for a 
distance of about 30 miles. After 
that it is called by its original 
name, but in Dutch spelling: Rijn. 
(Remember Rembrandt van 
Rijn?) Another arm of the 
Rhine is called the Lek; but the 
portion of the Lek near its mouth 
is called the Nieuw Meuse. (Pre- 
sumably due to an old misunder- 
standing, for the Meuse, or Maas, 
is the river to the south of the 
Rhine which widens into the Hol- 
landsch Diep before it empties 
itself into the North Sea.) The

93 



third river is the Schelde, which 
begins to widen just as soon as it 
has passed Antwerp. 

At one time all this was under 
Roman occupation, of course. It 
would be most interesting if some 
Roman had drawn us a map of 
the country as it looked when he 
was commander of a legion. Actu- 
ally Roman writers say very little 
about the country . most likely 
because it wasn’t worth anything 
in its natural state. Only three 
classical sources are known to me, 
Tacitus (in his Germania ), Pom- 
ponius Mela (in his De Choro- 
graphia ) and, of course, Cajus 
Plinius Secundus (Pliny the 
Elder) in his “Natural History”. 
Pomponius Mela has just one 
sentence for the current Holland: 
“Then it (meaning the Rhine) is 
no longer a river but an enormous 
lake covering a large area, called 
Fie vo.” (. “sed ingens lacus, ubi 
campos implevit, Flevo dicitur," 
if you want the original wording.) 

The most accurate, as usual, is 
Pliny. He states that the Rhine 
in that area has three arms, 
named Helium (the western- 
most), Rhenus (the center arm) 
and Flevum (the arm that goes 
to the north.) “In the north the 
Rhine widens into the lake. In the 
west it empties into the Meuse.” 
One of the commentators of Pliny 
added that in 12 B.C. the Roman 
general Drusus Germanicus (also 
known as Drusus Senior) “con- 



nected Flevo lake with the Rhine, 
probably following the bed of the 
river Yssel” (in Dutch IJssel.) 

All this is not too helpful now, 
but a few facts emerge. 

River water made a very large 
lake, probably in the southern 
part of what later became the 
Zuider Zee, while at least one 
arm of the Rhine seems to have 
merged inland with the Meuse. 
The overall picture is that of an 
area where a canoe was far more 
useful than a horse — and which, 
consequently, did not interest the 
Romans. They liked firm ground 
and were partial to paved high- 
ways. 

Since two Dutch words will 
crop up all the time in what is to 
follow they might as well be ex- 
plained in advance. The word Zee 
(pronounced Zay) refers to a 
body of salt water, while the word 
Meer (pronounced like “mare”) 
means a body of fresh water. 
This is somewhat confusing, be- 
cause two German words which 
look almost the same and sound 
the same happen to have almost 
the opposite meanings. A German 
See is a fresh-water lake, if used 
with the masculine article, and a 
body of salt water if used with 
the feminine article. And the Ger- 
man word Meer means the ocean. 
One sometimes feels that a good 
synonym for “language” would be 
“chaos.” 

At any event, the Dutch

wrested land both from the salty 
Zee and from freshwater Meet by 
building dikes, filling in and drain- 
ing. But, in spite of hard work 



through many generations, the 
overall balance did not look so 
good. A Dutch government pam- 
phlet states that between 1200

95 



and about 1900 A. D. the Dutch 
made land to the following ex- 
tent: 

940.000 acres along the sea- 

shore 

345.000 acres by draining lakes 



1,285,000 acres. 

But during the same time they 
lost 1,400,000 acres! 

The name of that loss was 
Zuider Zee. 

r | ''HE formation of the Zuider 
Zee is easy to explain. The 
whole area was below sea level 
all along, with its deepest portion 
filled by Flevo lake. But a great 
deal of the Zuider Zee area re- 
mained dry land simply because 
higher land near the shore pro- 
tected it from the North Sea. 

The catastrophe which flooded 
the low-lying basin with salt water 
announced itself with a stormy 
spring tide on All Saint’s Day of 
1170 A. D. On that day the North 
Sea tore two pieces of land from 
the North Holland province, 
creating the two islands of Wier- 
ingen and Texel. Just about a 
century later, on Christmas Day, 
1277, the North Sea finally broke 
through, flooding the whole area 
and producing the Zuider Zee. 

In 1277 nobody could even 
think of doing anything about it. 

But a few centuries later, pre- 
sumably encouraged by success- 
ful dike building on a smaller 



scale, some Dutchman began to 
wonder whether the work of the 
North Sea might not be undone. 
A study by Hendrik Stevin, pub- 
lished in 1667 under the title 
“How the Fury of the North Sea 
may be stopped and Holland may 
be protected against it” may not 
have been the very first study to 
consider draining of the Zuider 
Zee, but it was the first to see 
print. During the following 150 
years the idea of reclaiming the 
area covered by the Zuider Zee 
was expounded quite often in the 
Netherlands (some Germans also 
gave good advice across the bor- 
der) but it got to be a theme like 
the railway tunnel from Calais 
to Dover: much literature and no 
action. 

The reason why there was no 
action was very simple: any Zui- 
der Zee plan would require a 
colossal investment. 

If the plan succeeded this in- 
vestment would be recovered and, 
in time, large profits would be 
made. But if it failed for any one 
of a dozen different reasons the 
investment would be a total loss. 

In the meantime another proj- 
ect simply had to be tackled. 
There were two bodies of fresh 
water which offered a threat to 
Amsterdam, the capital. One of 
them was the IJ (the Dutch treat 
“ij” as one letter, hence the appar- 
ent double capital in words like 
IJssel; the pronunciation is sim- 



96 



GALAXY 



ply a long I) which had an open 
connection to the Zuider Zee. The 
other was the H aarlemmermeer. 

To get rid of the menace, the 
sum of 8,355,000 guilders was 
earmarked in 1837. Work began 
three years later and lasted a 
dozen years. The Dutch govern- 
ment somewhat ruefully stated 
that it had cost 13,789,377 guild- 
ers. But it had been a success, 
even though another 20 years of 
work were needed to change the 
newly won land into fruitful soil. 

The Dutch name for reclaimed 
land is “polder”. Reclaiming land 
is therefore called by a term which 
can be Anglicized as “inpolder- 
ing.” While the IJ polder and the 
Haarlemmermeer polder were 
still wet, three scientists and en- 
gineers, van Diggelen, Kloppen- 
burg and Faddegon, published a 
similar scheme for the Zuider Zee. 
An enormous dike was to close 
the mouth of the big bay, the 
trapped water was slowly to be 
pumped out and the two rivers 
emptying themselves into the 
Zuider Zee, the IJssel and the 
Amstel, were to be diverted to go 
into the North Sea directly. 

The cost estimate was 92 mil- 
lion guilders. 

A S MORE and more projects 
were published or submitted 
to the government in the form 
of memoranda, the government 
felt that there should be a body 



of experts which could judge the 
feasibility of the various plans. 
Thus an evaluation group, the 
Zuiderzeevereeniging, was estab- 
lished. 

To see what they would get if 
they did inpolder the Zuider Zee 
extensive drilling was carried out. 
(One source says 2188 test drill- 
ings were made.) It became clear 
that about three-fourths of the 
area of the Zuider Zee could be 
made into valuable land. 

Especially three men were the 
driving spirits: van Diggelen, Dr. 
Cornelis Lely and the head of 
the evaluation group, Dr. Buma. 
A complete plan was finished in 
1892. But it took time. The turn- 
ing point was probably the speech 
made by Queen Wilhelmina of 
The Netherlands on the occasion 
of the opening of parliament in 
September, 1913. The speech con- 
tained the sentences: “I consider 
the time has come to undertake 
the enclosure and reclamation of 
the Zuider Zee. The result will be 
improved water control conditions 
in the adjacent provinces, exten- 
sion of territory and a permanent 
increase in the opportunities of 
employment.” 

If times had been normal, the 
Queen’s words would probably 
have caused quick action. But 
times were not normal. The First 
World War was brewing. 

The act of parliament which 
decided to attack the Zuider Zee 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



97 



was passed on June 14, 1918. The 
scheme to be followed was that 
of Dr. Cornells Lely. 

It differed from other and 
earlier schemes in preserving a 
body of water in the Zuider Zee 
area. The older schemes had sim- 
ply wanted to close up the whole 
of the bay and to re-route the 
rivers going into the Zuider Zee 
so that they would go into the 
North Sea directly. Dr. Lely 
pointed out that this might lead 



to floods farther inland if, as can 
happen, a storm-driven flood 
raises the level of the North Sea 
for a few days above the level of 
the rivers. This does not mean, of 
course, that the level of the whole 
North Sea would be above that of 
the rivers; it would only be the 
level of the sea near the coast. 
But that is reason for disaster 
enough. Moreover, Dr. Lely did 
not want to kill off the Zuider Zee 
fisheries. Finally, he wanted the 




98 



GALAXY 



newly won land to be accessible 
by water. 

In short: instead of just drying 
up the whole bottom of the bay, 
a number of very large islands 
were to be created in its area. 

The overall scheme, then, en- 
visaged first the construction of 
the main dike, from the island of 
Wieringen to Friesland at the 
eastern shore of the Zuider Zee. 
Then two large polders were to 
be started, one going south from 
the island of Wieringen, 49,000 
acres in extent. This was first 
called the northwest polder, but 
later the name was changed to 
Wieringermeer polder. 

The other polder was to be to 
the South of Friesland, the north- 
east polder, 119,000 acres in ex- 
tent. It is, incidentally, the only 
one which has retained its original 
and purely geographical name. 
Then the southeast polder, the 
biggest of them all (232,000 
acres) was to be tackled. Since 
then the name has ben changed 
into Flevoland, since this is the 
probable area of Flevo Lacus of 
the Romans. Also, the job has 
been subdivided into two phases, 
East Flevoland and South Flevo- 
land, though this is going to be 
one polder when finished. 

The last of the projected pold- 
ers was the southwest polder 
(150,000 acres), now called 
Markerwaard. 

The remaining body of water 



would then have an area of nearly 
250,000 acres. It had to be fairly 
large to receive the waters of the 
IJssel and other smaller rivers, 
and because of the peculiar and 
probably unique circumstance 
that the salt water outside the 
main dike would often have a 
higher level than the water inside 
the dike. No water could then be 
discharged into the North Sea. 
And under bad flood conditions 
this might go on for some time, 
so there had to be a basin to hold 
the river water until it could be 
discharged. 

But in the course of time this 
basin would become fresh water, 
hence it should no longer be 
called by the old name: No longer 
Zuiderzee (the Dutch run words 
together) but Ijsselmeer. 

V^ORK started in 1927. Three 
** things were tackled simul- 
taneously, the main dike, the 
Wieringermeer polder and a 100- 
acre trial polder which was 
named Andijk. The purpose of 
the trial polder was to have an 
experimental area for finding out 
how the land had to be treated 
after it had been inpoldered. 

Obviously you can’t go ahead 
and try to sow wheat or plant 
beets on land which had been 
soaking in salt water for six hun- 
dred years. Incidentally, the 
polders to be started later would 
benefit from the gradual sweet- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



99 



ening of the Ijsselmeer, since that 
would leach out salt. 

By 1929 the test polder was 
dry. The next task was to make it 
into soil which could be useful. 

At the German end of the 
North Sea land had been re- 
claimed from the sea in the past, 
too, by inpoldering. There it had 
been a rule of thumb among the 
peasants that a new polder, if 
kept well drained, would become 
useful in six or seven years time. 
In half a dozen years enough rain 
fell on a polder to wash the salt 
away. The Dutch presumably had 
done the same in the past, but 
now they were looking for meth- 
ods to speed up the natural proc- 
ess. Gypsum was added to the 
soil, then fertilizers, different fer- 
tilizers in different parts of the 
test polder. Then they experi- 
mented with various vegetables 
to see which would succeed. 

The test polder ceased to exist 
as such on November 1, 1935. It 
had done its job as an experimen- 
tal farm. Now it became just a 
farm. 

By that time the main dam was 
finished, too. 

The island of Wieringen served 
as an anchor. It had been con- 
nected to the mainland with a 
comparatively short dam in 1925. 
The big job was the dam from 
Wieringen to Friesland, 20 miles 
of dam to be built right through 
the sea. The bulk of the dam is 



sand and earth dredged from the 
sea bottom. 

On the inland side the dam has 
a heavy stone facing. On the sea- 
ward side there is a bulge of 
boulder clay. On top of this clay 
bulge brushwood mattresses were 
laid, made by twisting brushwood 
into heavy rope-like shapes and 
then weaving these “ropes” into 
mattresses. On top of the mat- 
tresses they dumped heavy boul- 
ders, field stones, pieces of old 
concrete, anything that would 
weigh a lot and withstand the 
pounding of the waves for an in- 
definite length of time. 

At first this was just hard work, 
in the sense that large quantities 
of clay and rocks had to be moved 
and put into position. But as the 
building of the dam progressed, 
the space through which the tide 
could flow in and out of the 
Zuider Zee became narrower and 
narrower and the current in the 
remaining gap became more and 
more violent. 

The man who furnished the 
necessary calculations of what to 
expect of this current was Hend- 
rik Antoon Lorentz, Nobel Prize 
winner in Physics in 1902. As the 
critical period of closing the final 
gap approached, the expenditure 
in men and equipment began to 
resemble that for a real battle. 
Ten thousand people were on the 
dam. There were 27 large dredges 
in action, 13 floating cranes, 132 



100 



GALAXY 




barges and 88 tugs. The closing 
of the dam was timed like an 
attack. At such and such a time 
the current would be near a 
standstill, then were so and so 
many hours for plugging the dam. 
When the tide returned it had to 
find a solid obstacle. 

The dam was finished on May 
28, 1932. 

A T THAT time the polder to 
the south of the island of 
Wieringer, the Wieringermeer 
polder, was ready to receive its 
first crop. Since the area was 
somewhat protected by the island 



(and by the beginnings of the 
big dam), this polder had been 
finished in 1932. The experience 
gained on the test polder enabled 
the Dutch experts to make the 
land arable within only two years 
of its being dry. 

On this polder — as well as on 
the ones finished later — the 
system was to divide it into plots 
of roughly 50 acres. Each one of 
these plots had a paved road in 
front and a large canal in the 
back, making it accessible both by 
land and by water. Just in case 
the main dam might give way, a 
most unlikely thing, a terp (arti-

ficial hill) was built in the center 
of the polder. It is high enough 
to be several feet above the high- 
est recorded flood level of the 
North Sea, and large enough to , 
protect everything on the polder 
than can move and climb it. 
(Somebody calculated that the ; 
whole population of Amsterdam 
would have standing room on top ( 
of the terp.) i 

Two years after finishing the ( 
big dam work began on northeast 
polder, which was ready to bear 
crops ten years later, in 1942. 

Naturally the soil of such a 
polder is not uniform. As any- i 
where else the quality varies from i 
area to area. The best land of a 
polder is used for vegetables, the 
next best for grain (mainly rye), ] 
while the poorest sections are ;

ing to worry about many other 
things. But two major catastro- 
phes happened. 

The first was the German oc- 
cupation of the Netherlands dur- 
ing the Second World War which, 
naturally, brought everything to 
a near standstill, though the Ger- 
mans, at first, did not interfere 
directly. In fact quite a number 
of German engineers looked very 
carefully, if unofficially, at the 
Wieringermeer polder, because 
they had had a similar project in 
mind since about 1932. There had 
been talk about inpoldering a bay 
called the Frische Haff (to the 
east of Danzig) and they wanted 
to see how it was done. 

The Frische Haff project would 
have been easier than the Zuider 
Zee for several reasons. To begin 
with, the bay is nearly fresh water 
naturally, and because of the 
geometry of the land only an 
eight-mile dam would be needed. 
This project, incidentally, is now 
dead because the area became 
Polish after the war. Of course it 
may be revived as a Polish proj- 
ect. 

But near the end of the war the 
Germans wrecked dikes deliber- 
ately to protect their own retreat, 
especially in the area of the Prov- 
ince of Zeeland. But the dikes 
wrecked by the retreating Ger-

man armies were repaired and 
Zeeland lived up to its Latin 
motto luctoT et emergo, “I strug- 
gle and emerge.” 

A FTER the damage had been 
repaired most Dutchmen, in- 
cluding the Zeelanders, would 
concede that such things could 
and would happen during a war, 
but thought that everything was 
fine with the dikes and the co- 
existence of the North Sea and 
the Kingdom of The Netherlands 
otherwise. The day and night 
which taught them differently 
was the first day of February, 
1953. 

Storm conditions were unusual 
and intense, the dikes of Zeeland 
were breached in 67 places, 
375,000 acres of land were 
flooded, 9,000 buildings de- 
stroyed and 38,000 more dam- 
aged. The death toll was 1800 
people. 

The overall damage was esti- 
mated at over 300 million dollars. 

A Dutch agency, the Rijks- 
waterstaat (we would call an 
equivalent agency, if we had one, 
the Federal Water Administra- 
tion), had been worried all along, 
and had drafted memoranda 
about things that really should be 
done. But their warnings had ap- 
peared unnecessary. 

But after the February flood of 
1953 every Dutchman suddenly 
realized what he had merely 



learned in school, namely that 60 
per cent of the kingdom’s popu- 
lation live and work below sea 
level. And the Rijkswaterstaafs 
plan was quickly accepted. 

Zeeland, as a look at the map 
will show, consists of half a dozen 
large and a few small islands, 
grouped around four major out- 
lets for river water into the sea. 
But under bad storm conditions 
these become four major inlets 
for the sea. 

To keep the islands of Zeeland 
safe as they now are, some 500 
miles of dikes would have to be 
raised by six to seven feet, involv- 
ing the reconstruction of about a 
hundred locks, culverts, pumping 
stations and so forth. The alterna- 
tive, the Delta Plan, is just to tie 
the whole complex of islands to- 
gether into one land by building 
a total of about 20 miles of dikes, 
as sturdy as the main dam, across 
the mouth of the Zuider Zee. 

The first step of the Delta Plan 
— now under way — is the so- 
called three-island plan, a name 
which is based on the fact that 
once Walcheren, North Beveland 
and South Beveland were three 
islands. 

Earlier work has already con- 
nected Walcheren and South 
Beveland. Then the northern- 
most of those outlets, called Har- 
ingsvliet, is to be dammed. The 
target date is 1968. Then the 
second outlet, called the Brouwer- 



104 



GALAXY 



shavensche Gat, is to be dammed; 
this dam should be completed in 
1970. The next dam, and inci- 
dentally the longest one in the 
Delta Plan, will go across the 
outlet called the Easter Schelde. 
(It is called that not with the 
religious holiday in mind but in 
contrast to the Wester Schelde.) 
It will seal it off by 1978. 

The southernmost of the out- 
lets, the Wester Schelde, must be 
left open; there is heavy traffic 
up and down the Wester Schelde 
to Antwerp, which is not a Dutch 
city. Here the dike along the 
southern shore of Walcheren and 
South Beveland will have to be 
raised and strengthened. The 
same is true to the north of Zee- 
land. The deep channel between 
Rotterdam and the sea, the so- 
called Rotterdamsche Waterweg, 
also cannot be interfered with, so 
that a protecting dike at or near 
the southern shore of the Water- 
weg is indicated. 

One of the reasons why the 
Delta Plan was accepted so fast 
and is pursued energetically is 
that the storm conditions of 1953 
have been carefully examined. It 
turned out, to everybody’s horror, 
that the 1953 situation still con- 
tained mitigating factors. The 
flood could have been four feet 
higher than it was! 

The Delta Plan is mainly de- 
fensive. It is not aimed at produc- 
ing much new land. But it has the 



secondary aim of producing a 
large fresh water reservoir. The 
interconnected bodies of water 
behind the Delta Plan dams are 
already referred to collectively as 
the Zeeuwse Meet, the Zeeland 
lake. 

The fact is that The Nether- 
lands, which are always plagued 
by too much sea water and are 
seasonally plagued by too much 
river water too, do need more 
fresh water in midsummer. The 
Zeeuwse Meer will be the irriga- 
tion reservoir for these periods. 

f T'HERE are two secondary 
^ dams, from Duiveland to 
Overflakkee and from there to 
the mainland. Later on they will 
carry highways, but their primary 
purpose is to influence the cur- 
rents in such a way that the main 
dams will be easier to build. 

Another part of the Delta Plan 
is a most interesting construction 
to the east of Rotterdam. There 
is a river coming in from the east 
called the Hollandsche I Jssel. 
Though the name is the same it 
has nothing to do with the IJssel 
which puts fresh water into the 
Ijsselmeer. (The latter is some- 
times called the Geldersche IJssel, 
to avoid confusion between the 
two rivers.) What is wrong with 
the Hollandsche IJssel is that it 
could be a very vulnerable point 
in case of a bad flood. The sea, 
racing up in a tidal wave through

the Rotterdamsche Waterweg 
could enter the Hollandsche 
IJssel and pour into the low-lying 
land to the East of Rotterdam. 

What has been built is actually 
an enormous guillotine, a steel 
blade as wide as the river, resting 
in two massive towers. If a wave 
should come up the Waterweg the 
steel blade can be lowered within 
minutes, literally cutting off the 
flood. The construction is now be- 
ing finished, but as far as I know 
it hasn’t been needed yet. 

As has been mentioned, the 
purpose of the Delta Plan is not 
to make more land, but to make 
the existing land safe. However, 
between 25,000 and 40,000 acres 
of new land will be a by-product. 

Have the Dutch reached the 
limit of the new land they can 
make with the Delta Plan? 

By no means. There is another 
scheme m the future. Dutch gov- 
ernment sources are careful to 
point out that this is in the more 
distant future — partly, no doubt, 
to calm the feelings of Dutch tax 
payers, partly because the Delta 
Plan should be hurried with all 



available means, since nobody 
can tell when the next big flood 
will build up. 

But that “future plan” is ob- 
vious from a glance at the map. 
There is rather shallow water to 
the north of the big Zuider Zee 
dam. The Dutch call it the Wad- 
denzee. To the north of the Wad- 
denzee you have a chain of 
islands, obviously indicating the 
original coastline. A dam from 
North Holland to the island of 
Texel would not be longer than 
the average Delta Plan dam, 
though it may be more difficult 
to build. 

The same statement holds 
true for the dams between the 
islands all the way to the island 
of Ameland, and a dam from 
Ameland to the mainland would 
be only about half the length of 
the Zuider Zee dam. 

One Dutch expert, Prof. 
Thyse, said, “It will be done not 
later than the year 2000.” 

Personally I am willing to bet 
that it will be long finished when 
that oft-used date comes around.

this may be our last opportunity 
to discover how those creatures 
reproduce — ” said Laoconia. 
She shook her head. “What we 
really should be doing is going in 
there with a full staff, capturing 
representative specimens, putting 
them through — ” 

“You will note the prohibition 
in Section D of the High Council’s 
mandate,” said Dr. Fladdis. “‘The 
Field Agent may not enclose, re- 
strain or otherwise restrict the 
freedom of any Rukuchp na- 
tive ’ ” 

“How bad is their birthrate 
situation?” asked Laoconia. 

“We have only the word of the 
Rukuchp special spokesman. 



This Gafka. He said it was crit- 
ical. That, of course, was the de- 
termining factor with the High 
Council. Rukuchp appealed to us 
for help.” 

Laoconia got to her feet. “You 
know what I think of this music 
idea. But if that’s the way we’re 
going to attack it, why don’t we 
just break the law all the way — 
take in musical recordings, 
players . .” 

“Please!” snapped Dr. Fladdis. 

Laoconia stared at him. She 
had never before seen the Area 
Director so agitated. 

“The Rukuchp natives say that 
introduction of foreign music has 
disrupted some valence of their 
reproductive cycle,” said Dr. 
Fladdis. “At least, that’s how 
we’ve translated their explana- 
tion. This is the reason for the 
law prohibiting any traffic in 
music devices.” 

“I’m not a child!” snapped 
Laoconia. “You don’t have to ex- 
plain all. .” 

“We cannot be too careful,” 
said Dr. Fladdis. “With the mem- 
ory of Monligol still fresh in all 
minds.” He shuddered. “We must 
return to the spirit of the SocAnth 
motto: ‘For the Greater Good of 
the Universe.’ We’ve been 
warned.” 

“I don’t see how music can be 
anything but a secondary stimu- 
lant,” said Laoconia. “However, I 
shall keep an open mind.”

1 AOCONIA Wilkinson looked 
up from her notes, said: 
“Marie, was that a noise outside?” 
She pushed a strand of gray hair 
from her forehead. 

Marie Medill stood at the op- 
posite side of the field hut, staring 
out one of the two windows. “I 
only hear the leaves,” she said. 
“They’re awfully loud in that 
wind.” 

“You’re sure it wasn’t Gafka?” 

Marie sighed and said, “No, it 
wasn’t his namesong.” 

“Stop calling that monster a 
him!” snapped Laoconia. 

Marie’s shoulders stiffened. 

Laoconia observed the reflex 
and thought how wise the Service 
had been to put a mature, veteran 
anthropologist in command here. 
A hex-dome hut was too small to 
confine brittle tempers. And the 
two women had been confined 
here for 25 weeks already. La- 
oconia stared at her companion — 
such a young romantic, that one. 

Marie’s pose reflected boredom 
. worry . 

Laoconia glanced around the 
hut’s crowded interior. Servo-re- 
corders, night cameras, field com- 
puters, mealmech, collapsible 
floaters, a desk, two chairs, fold- 
ing bunks, three wall sections 
taken up by the transceiver 
linking them with the mother 
ship circling in satellite orbit 
overhead. Everything in its place 
and a place for everything. 



“Somehow, I just can’t help 
calling Gafka a him,” said Marie. 
She shrugged. “I know it’s non- 
sense. Still . when Gafka 
sings. .” 

Laoconia studied the younger 
woman. A blonde girl in a one- 
piece green uniform; heavy peas- 
ant figure, good strong legs, an 
oval face with high forehead and 
dreaming blue eyes. 

“Speaking of singing,” said 
Laoconia, “I don’t know what I 
shall do if Gafka doesn’t bring 
permission for us to attend their 
Big Sing. We can’t solve this mess 
without the facts.” 

“No doubt,” said Marie. She 
spoke snappishly, trying to keep 
her attention away from Lao- 
conia. The older woman just sat 
there. She was always just sitting 
there — so efficient, so driving, a 
tall gawk with windburned face, 
nose too big, mouth too big, chin 
too big, eyes too small. 

ARIE turned away. 

“With every day that passes 
I’m more convinced that this 
music thing is a blind alley,” said 
Laoconia. “The Rukuchp birth- 
rate keeps going down no matter 
how much of our music you teach 
them.” 

“But Gafka agrees,” protested 
Marie. “Everything points to it. 
Our discovery of this planet 
brought the Rukuchps into con- 
tact with the first alien music

they’ve ever known. Somehow, 
that’s disrupted their breeding 
cycle. I’m sure of it.” 

“Breeding cycle,” sniffed Lao- 
conia. “For all we know, these 
creatures could be ambulatory 
vegetables without even the most 
rudimentary. .” 

“I’m so worried,” said Marie. 
“It’s music at the root of the 
problem, I’m sure, but if it ever 
got out that we smuggled in those 
education tapes and taught Gafka 
all our musical forms. .” 

“We did not smuggle any- 
thing!” barked Laoconia. “The 
law is quite clear. It only prohib- 
its any form of mechanical re- 
producer of actual musical 
sounds. Our tapes are all com- 
pletely visual.” 

“I keep thinking of Monligol,” 
said Marie. “I couldn’t live with 
the knowledge that I’d contrib- 
uted to the extinction of a sen- 
tient species. Even indirectly. If 
our foreign music really has dis- 
rupted . .” 

“We don’t even know if they 
breed!” 

“But Gafka says. .” 

“Gafka says! A dumb vege- 
table. Gafka says!” 

“Not so dumb,” countered 
Marie. “He learned to speak our 
language in less than three weeks, 
but we have only the barest rudi- 
ments of songspeech.” 

“Gafka’s an idiot-savant,” said 
Laoconia. “And I’m not certain 



I’d call what that creature does 
speaking.” 

“It is too bad that you’re tone 
deaf,” said Marie sweetly. 

Laoconia frowned. She leveled 
a finger at Marie. “The thing I 
note is that we only have their 
word that their birthrate is de- 
clining. They called on us for 
help, and now they obstruct 
every attempt at field observa- 
tion.” 

“They’re so shy,” said Marie. 

“They’re going to be shy one 
SocAnth field expedition if they 
don’t invite us to that Big Sing,” 
said Laoconia. “Oh! If the Coun- 
cil had only authorized a full field 
expedition with armed support!” 

“They couldn’t!” protested 
Marie. “After Monligol, practi- 
cally every sentient race in the 
universe is looking on Rukuchp 
as a final test case. If we mess up 
another race with our med- 
dling . .” 

“Meddling!” barked Laoconia. 
“Young woman, the Social Anth- 
ropological Service is a holy call- 
ing! Erasing ignorance, helping 
the backward races!” 

“And we’re the only judges of 
what’s backward,” said Marie. 
“How convenient. Now, you take 
Monligol. Everyone knows that 
insects carry disease. So we move 
in with our insecticides and kill 
off the symbiotic partner essen- 
tial to Monligolian reproduction. 
How uplifting.”

“They should have told us,” 
said Laoconia. 

“They couldn’t,” said Marie. 
“It was a social taboo.” 

“Well. .” Laoconia shrugged. 
“That doesn’t apply here.” 

“How do you know?” 

“I’ve had enough of this silly 
argument,” barked Laoconia. “See 
if Gafka’s coming. He’s overdue.” 

‘jl/TARIE inhaled a trembling 
breath, stamped across to 
the field hut’s lone door and 
banged it open. Immediately the 
tinkle of glazeforest leaves grew 
louder. The wind brought an odor 
of peppermint from the stubble 
plain to her left. 

She looked across the plain at 
the orange ball of Almac sinking 
toward a flat horizon, swung her 
glance to the right where the wall 
of the glazeforest loomed over- 
head. Rainbow-streaked batwing 
leaves clashed in the wind, shift- 
ing in subtle competition for the 
last of the day’s orange light. 

“Do you see if?” demanded 
Laoconia. 

Marie dropped her attention to 
the foot of the forest wall, where 
stubble spikes crowded against 
great glasswood trunks. “No.” 
“What is keeping that crea- 
ture?” 

Marie shook her head, setting 
blonde curls dancing across her 
uniform collar. “It’ll be dark 
soon,” she said. “He said he’d re- 



turn before it got fully dark.” 

Laoconia scowled, pushed a- 
side her notes. Always calling it 
a him! They’re nothing but ani- 
mated Easter eggs! If only . 
She broke the train of thought, 
attention caught by a distant 
sound. 

“There!” Marie peered down 
the length of glazeforest wall. 

A fluting passage of melody 
hung on the air. It was the 
meister-song of a delicate wind 
instrument. As they listened, the 
tones deepened to an organ throb 
while a section of cello strings 
held the melody. Glazeforest 
leaves began to tinkle in sympa- 
thetic harmony. Slowly, the music 
faded. 

“It’s Gafka,” whispered Marie. 
She cleared her throat, spoke 
louder, self-consciously: “He’s 

coming out of the forest quite a 
ways down.” 

“I can’t tell one from the 
other,” said Laoconia. “They all 
look alike and sound alike. 
Monsters.” 

“They do look alike,” agreed 
Marie, “but the sound is quite 
individual.” 

“Let’s not harp on my tone 
deafness!” snapped Laoconia. She 
joined Marie at the door. “If 
they’ll only let us attend their 
Sing. .” 

A six-foot Easter egg ambled 
toward them on four of its five 
prehensile feet.

The crystal glistening of its 
vision cap, tipped slightly toward 
the field hut, was semi-lidded by 
inner cloud-pigment in the direc- 
tion of the setting sun. Blue and 
white greeting colors edged a 
great bellows muscle around the 
torso. The bell extension of a 
mouth/ear — normally visible in 
a red-yellow body beneath the 
vision cap — had been retracted 
to a multi-creased pucker. 

“What ugly brutes,” said 
Laoconia. 

“Shhhh!” said Marie. “You 
don’t know how far away he can 
hear you.” She waved an arm. 
“Gaaafkaa!” Then: “Damn!” 

“What’s wrong?” 

“I only made eight notes out of 
his name instead of nine.” 

Gafka came up to the door, 
picking a way through the stubble 
spikes. The orange mouth/ear ex- 
tended, sang a 22-note harmonica 
passage: “Maarrriee Mmmmmm- 
edillll.” Then a 10-second con- 
certo: “Laoconnnnia Wiiilkinnn- 
sonnnn!” 

“How lovely!” said Marie. 

“I wish you’d talk straight out 
the way we taught you,” said 
Laoconia. “That singing is diffi- 
cult to follow.” 

/^AFKA’S vision cap tipped to- 
ward her. The voice shifted 
to a sing-song waver: “But polite 
sing greeting.” 

“Of course,” said Laoconia. 



“Now.” She took a deep breath. 
“Do we have permission to attend 
your Big Sing?” 

Gafka’s vision cap tipped to- 
ward Marie, back to Laoconia. 

“Please, Gafka?” said Marie. 

“Difficulty,” wavered Gafka. 
“Not know how say. Not have 
knowledge your kind people. Is 
subject not want for talking.” 

“I see,” said Laoconia, recog- 
nizing the metaphorical formula. 
“It has to do with your breeding 
habits.” 

Gafka’s vision cap clouded 
over with milky pigment, a sign 
the two women had come to rec- 
ognize as embarrassment. 

“Now, Gafka,” said Laoconia. 
“None of that. We’ve explained 
about science and professional 
ethics, the desire to be of real 
help to one another. You must 
understand that both Marie and 
I are here for the good of your 
people.” 

A crystal moon unclouded in 
the part of the vision cap facing 
Laoconia. 

“If we could only get them to 
speak straight out,” said Lao- 
conia. 

Marie said: “Please, Gafka. We 
only want to help.” 

“Understand I,” said Gafka. 
“How else talk this I?” More of 
the vision cap unclouded. “But 
must ask question. Friends per- 
haps not like.” 

“We are scientists,” said Lao- 



112 



GALAXY 



conia. “You may ask any ques- 
tion you wish.” 

“You are too old for . breed- 
ing?” asked Gafka. Again the 
vision cap clouded over, sparing 
Gafka the sight of Laoconia 
shocked speechless. 

Marie stepped into the breech. 
“Gafka! Your people and my peo- 
ple are . well, we’re just too 
different. We couldn’t. There’s no 
way . that is . .” 

“Impossible!” barked Laoconia. 
“Are you implying that we might 
be sexually attacked if we at- 
tended your Big Sing?” 

Gafka’s vision cap unclouded, 
tipped toward Laoconia. Purple 
color bands ran up and down the 
bellows muscle, a sign of con- 
fusion. 

“Not understand I about sex 
thing,” said Gafka. “My people 
never hurt other creature.” The 
purple bands slowed their up- 
ward-downward chasing, relaxed 
into an indecisive green. The vi- 
sion cap tipped toward Marie. “Is 
true all life kinds start egg young 
same?” This time the clouding of 
the vision cap was only a mo- 
mentary glimmerwhite. 

“Essentially, that is so,” agreed 
Laoconia. “We all do start with 
an egg. However, the fertilization 
process is different with different 
peoples.” Aside to Marie, she 
said: “Make a note of that point 
about eggs. It bears out that they 
may be oviparian as I suspected.” 



Then: “Now, I must know what 
you meant by your question.” 

Gafka’s vision cap rocked left, 
right, settled on a point between 
the two women. The sing-song 
voice intoned: “No.t understand I 
about different ways. But know I 
you see many thing my people 
not see. If breeding (glimmer- 
white) different, or you too old 
for breeding (glimmerwhite) my 
people say you come Big Sing. 
Not want we make embarrass for 
you.” 

4 4 \\/E are scientists,” said 
Laoconia. “It’s quite all 
right. Now, may we bring our 
cameras and recording equip- 
ment?” 

“Bring you much of things?” 
asked Gafka. 

“We’ll only be taking one large 
floater to carry our equipment,” 
said Laoconia. “How long must 
we be prepared to stay?” 

“One night,” said Gafka. “I 
bring worker friends to help with 
floater. Go I now. Soon be dark. 
Come moonrise I return, take to 
Big Sing place you.” The trumpet 
mouth fluted three minor notes 
of farewell, pulled back to an 
orange pucker. Gafka turned, 
glided into the forest. Soon he had 
vanished among reflections of 
glasswood boles. 

“A break at last!” barked Lao- 
conia. She strode into the hut, 
speaking over her shoulder. “Call

the ship. Have them monitor our 
equipment. Tell them to get dup- 
licate recordings. While we’re 
starting to analyze the sound- 
sight record down here they can 
be transmitting a copy to the 
master computers at Kampichi. 
We want as many minds on this 
as possible. We may never get 
another chance like this one!” 
Marie said: “I don’t — ” 
“Snap to it!” barked Laoconia. 
“Shall I talk to Dr. Baxter?” 
asked Marie. 

“Talk to Helen?” demanded 
Laoconia. “Why would you want 
to bother Helen with a routine 
question like this?” 

“I just want to discuss. .” 
“That transceiver is for official 
use only,” said Laoconia. “Trans- 
mit the message as I’ve directed. 
We’re here to solve the Rukuchp 
breeding problem, not to chit- 
chat.” 

“I feel suddenly so uneasy,” 
said Marie. “There’s something 
about this situation that worries 
me.” 

“Uneasy?” 

“I think we’ve missed the point 
of Gafka’s warning.” 

“Stop worrying,” said Laoconia. 
“The natives won’t give us any 
trouble. Gafka was looking for a 
last excuse to keep us from at- 
tending their Big Sing. You’ve 
seen how stupidly shy they are.” 
“But what if — ” 

“I’ve had a great deal of ex- 



perience in handling native peo- 
ples,” said Laoconia. “You never 
have trouble as long as you keep 
a firm, calm grip on the situation 
at all times.” 

“Maybe so. But. .” 

“Think of it!” said Laoconia. 
“The first humans ever to attend 
a Rukuchp Big Sing. Unique! You 
mustn’t let the magnitude of our 
achievement dull your mind. 
Stay cool and detached as I do. 
Now get that call off to the ship!” 

TT was a circular clearing per- 
haps two kilometers in dia- 
meter, dark with moonshadows 
under the giant glaze trees. High 
up around the rim of the clearing, 
moonlight painted prismatic rain- 
bows along every leaf edge. A 
glint of silver far above the center 
of the open area betrayed the 
presence of a tiny remote-control 
floater carrying night cameras 
and microphones. 

Except for a space near the 
forest edge occupied by Laoconia 
and Marie, the clearing was 
packed with silent shadowy 
humps of Rukuchp natives. Vision 
caps glinted like inverted bowls 
in the moonlight. 

Seated on a portable chair be- 
side the big pack-floater, Lao- 
conia adjusted the position of the 
tiny remote unit high above 
them. In the monitor screen be- 
fore her she could see what the 
floater lenses covered — the

clearing with its sequin glitter of 
Rukuchp vision caps and . the 
faintest gleam of red and green 
instrument lights between herself 
and Marie seated on the other 
side of the floater. Marie was 
monitoring the night lenses that 
would make the scene appear as 
bright as day on the recording 
wire. 

Marie straightened, rubbed 
the small of her back. “This 
clearing must be at least two kilo- 
meters across,” she whispered, 
impressed. 

Laoconia adjusted her ear- 
phones, tested a relay. Her feet 
ached. It had been at least a four- 
hour walk in here to this clear- 
ing. She began to feel latent 
qualms about what might be 
ahead in the nine hours left of the 
Rukuchp night. That stupid 
warning. 

“I said it’s a big clearing,” 
whispered Marie. 

Laoconia cast an apprehensive 
glance at the silent Rukuchp 
figures packed closely around. “I 
didn’t realize there’d be so many,” 
she whispered. “It doesn’t look to 
me as though they’re dying out. 
What does your monitor screen 
show?” 

“They fill the clearing,” whis- 
pered Marie. “And I think they 
extend back under the trees. I 
wish I knew which one was 
Gafka. I should’ve watched when 
he left us.” 



“Didn’t he say where he was 
going?” 

“He just asked if this spot was 
all right for us and if we were 
ready to help them.” 

“Well, I’m sure everything’s 
going to be all right,” said Lao- 
conia. She didn’t sound very con- 
vincing, even to herself. 

“Isn’t it time to contact the 
ship?” asked Marie. 

“They’ll be calling any — ” A 
light flashed red on the panel in 
front of Laoconia. “Here they are 
now.” 

QHE flipped a switch, spoke 
^ into her cheek microphone. 
“Yes?” 

The metallic chattering in 
Laoconia’s earphones only made 
Marie feel more lonely. The ship 
was so far away above them. 

“That’s right,” said Laoconia. 
“Transmit your record immedi- 
ately and ask Kampichi to make 
an independent study. We’ll com- 
pare notes later.” Silence while 
she listened, then: “I’m sure 

there’s no danger. You can keep 
an eye on us through the over- 
head lenses. But there’s never 
been a report of a Rukuchp na- 
tive offering violence to any- 
one. Well, I don’t see what we 
can do about it now. We’re here 
and that’s that. I’m signing off 
now.” She flipped the switch. 

“Was that Dr. Baxter?” asked 
Marie. 



MATING CALL

“Yes. Helen’s monitoring us 
herself, though I don’t see what 
she can do. Medical people are 
very peculiar sometimes. Has the 
situation changed with the na- 
tives?” 

“They haven’t moved that I 
can see.” 

“Why couldn’t Gafka have 
given us a preliminary briefing?” 
asked Laoconia. “I detest this 
flying blind.” 

“I think it still embarrasses 
him to talk about breeding,” said 
Marie. 

“Everything’s too quiet,” hissed 
Laoconia. “I don’t like it.” 



“They’re sure to do something 
soon,” whispered Marie. 

As though her words were the 
signal, an almost inaudible vibra- 
tion began to throb in the clear- 
ing. Glaze leaves started their 
sympathetic tinkle-chiming. The 
vibration grew, became an organ 
rumble with abrupt piping oblig- 
atto that danced along its edges. 
A cello insertion pulled a melody 
from the sound, swung it over the 
clearing while the glazeforest 
chimed louder and louder. 

“How exquisite,” breathed 
Marie. She forced her attention 
onto the instruments in front of 



116

her. Everything was functioning. 

The melody broke to a single 
clear high note of harmonic bril- 
liance — a flute sound that 
shifted to a second phase with 
expanded orchestration. The mu- 
sic picked up element after ele- 
ment while low-register tympani 
built a stately rhythm into it, and 
zither tinkles laid a counter-point 
on the rhythm. 

“Pay attention to your instru- 
ments,” hissed Laoconia. 

Marie nodded, swallowing. The 
music was like a song heard be- 
fore, but never before played 
with this perfection. She wanted 



to close her eyes; she wanted to 
submit entirely to the ecstasy of 
sound. 

Around them, the Rukuchp 
natives remained stationary, a 
rhythmic expansion and contrac- 
tion of bellows muscles their only 
movement. 

And the rapture of music in- 
tensified. 

Tl/fARIE moved her head from 
side to side, mouth open. 
The sound was an infinity of 
angel choirs — every sublimity 
of music ever conceived — now 
concentrated into one exquisite

distillation. She felt that it could 
not possibly grow more beautiful. 

But it did. 

There came a lifting-expand- 
ing-floating ... a long gliding 
suspenseful timelessness. 

Silence. 

Marie felt herself drifting back 
to awareness, found her hands 
limply fumbling with dials. Some 
element of habit assured her that 
she had carried out her part of 
the job, but that music . She 
shivered. 

“They sang for 47 minutes,” 
hissed Laoconia. She glanced 
around. “Now what happens?” 

Marie rubbed her throat, 
forced her attention onto the 
luminous dials, the floater, the 
clearing. A suspicion was forming 
in the back of her mind. 

“I wish I knew which one of 
these creatures was Gafka,” 
whispered Laoconia. “Do we dare 
arouse one of them, ask after 
Gafka?” 

“We’d better not,” said Marie. 

“These creatures did nothing 
but sing,” said Laoconia. “I’m 
more certain than ever that the 
music is stimulative and nothing 
more.” 

“I hope you’re right,” whis- 
pered Marie. Her suspicion was 
taking on more definite shape . 
music, controlled sound, ecstasy 
of controlled sound . Thoughts 
tumbled over each other in her 
mind. 



Time dragged out in silence. 

“What do you suppose they’re 
doing?” hissed Laoconia. “They’ve 
been sitting like this for 25 min- 
utes.” 

Marie glanced around at the 
ring of Rukuchp natives hem- 
ming in the little open space, 
black mounds topped by dim 
silver. The stillness was like a 
charged vacuum. 

More time passed. 

“Forty minutes!” whispered 
Laoconia. “Do they expect us to 
sit here all night?” 

Marie chewed her lower lip. 
Ecstasy of sound, she thought. 
And she thought of sea urchins 
and the parthenogenetic rabbits 
of Calibeau. 

A stirring movement passed 
through the Rukuchp ranks. 
Presently, shadowy forms began 
moving away into the glazefor- 
est’s blackness. 

“Where are they going?” 
hissed Laoconia. “Do you see 
Gafka?” 

“No.” 

The transmission-receive light 
flashed in front of Laoconia. She 
flipped the switch, pressed an 
earphone against her head. “They 
just seem to be leaving,” • she 
whispered into the cheek micro- 
phone. “You see the same thing 
we do. There’s been no move- 
ment against us. Let me call you 
back later. I want to observe 
this.”

GALAXY 



A Rukuchp figure came up be- 
side Marie. 

“Gafka?” said Marie. 

“Gafka,” intoned the figure. 
The voice sounded sleepy. 

Laoconia leaned across the in- 
strument-packed floater. “What 
are they doing now, Gafka?” she 
demanded. 

“All new song we make from 
music you give,” said Gafka. 

“Is the sing all ended?” asked 
Marie. 

“Same,” breathed Gafka. 

“What’s this about a new 
song?” demanded Laoconia. 

“Not have your kind song be- 
fore correct,” said Gafka. “In it 
too much new. Not understand 
we how song make you. But now 
you teach, make right you.” 

“What is all this nonsense?” 
asked Laoconia. “Gafka, where 
are your people all going?” 

“Going,” sighed Gafka. 

Laoconia looked around her. 
“But they’re departing singly . 
or . well, there don’t seem to be 
any mated pairs. What are they 
doing?” 

“Go each to wait,” said Gafka. 

And Marie thought of cary- 
ocinesis and daughter nuclei. 

“I don’t understand,” com- 
plained Laoconia. 

“You teach . how new song 
sing,” sighed Gafka. “New song 
best all time. We keep this song. 
Better much than old song. Make 
better — ” the women detected 



the faint glimmer-haze lidding of 
Gafka’s vision cap — “make 
better young. Strong more.” 
“Gafka,” said Marie, “is the 
song all you do? I mean, there 
isn’t anything else?” 

“All,” breathed Gafka. “Best 
song ever.” 

Laoconia said: “I think we’d 
better follow some of these. .” 
“That’s not necessary,” said 
Marie. “Did you enjoy their mu- 
sic, Dr. Wilkinson?” 

“Well. .” There appeared to 
be embarrassment in the way the 
older woman turned her head 
away. “It was very beautiful.” 
“And you enjoyed it?” per- 
sisted Marie. 

“I don’t see what. .” 

“You’re tone deaf,” said Marie. 
“It’s obviously a stimulant of 
some sort!” snapped Laoconia. “I 
don’t understand now why they 
won’t let us. .” 

“They let us,” said Marie. 

TT AOCONIA turned to Gafka. 
^ “I must insist, Gafka, that we 
be permitted to study all phases 
of your breeding process. Other- 
wise we can be of no help to you.” 
“You best help ever,” said 
Gafka. “Birthrate all good now. 
You teach way out from mixing 
of music.” A shudder passed up- 
ward through Gafka’s bellows 
muscles. 

“Do you make sense out of 
this?” demanded Laoconia.

“I’m afraid I do,” said Marie. 
“Aren’t you tired, Gafka?” 
“Same,” sighed Gafka. 
“Laoconia, Dr. Wilkinson, we’d 
better get back to the hut,” said 
Marie. “We can improvise what 
we’ll need for the Schafter test.” 
“But the Schafter’s for deter- 
mining human pregnancy!” pro- 
tested Laoconia. 

The red light glowed in front 
of Laoconia. She flipped the 
switch. “Yes?” 

Scratching sounds from the 
earphones broke the silence. 
Marie felt that she did not want 
to hear the voice from the ship. 

Laoconia said: “Of course I 
know you’re monitoring the test 
of . Why should I tell Marie 
you’ve already given Schafter 
tests to yourself . .” Laoconia’s 
voice climbed. “WHAT? You 
can’t be ser. That’s impossible! 
But, Helen, we . they . you 
. we ... Of course I . Where 
could we have . Every woman 
on the ship. .” 

There was a long silence while 
Marie watched Laoconia listen- 
ing to the earphones, nodding. 
Presently, Laoconia lifted the 
earphones off her head and put 
them down gently. Her voice 
came out listlessly. “Dr. Bax . 
Helen suspected that . she ad- 
ministered Schafter tests to her- 
self and some of the others.” 
“She listened to that music?” 
asked Marie. 



“The whole universe listened 
to that music,” said Laoconia. 
“Some smuggler monitored the 
ship’s official transmission of our 
recordings. Rebroadcast stations 
took it. Everyone’s going crazy 
about our beautiful music.” 

“Oh, no,” breathed Marie. 
Laoconia said: “Everyone on 
the ship listened to our record- 
ings. Helen said she suspected 
immediately after the broadcast, 
but she waited the full half hour 
before giving the Schafter test.” 
Laoconia glanced at the silent 
hump of Gafka standing beside 
Marie. “Every woman on that 
ship who could become pregnant 
is pregnant.” 

“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” asked 
Marie. “Gafka’s people have de- 
veloped a form of group parth- 
enogenesis. Their Big Sing sets 
off the blastomeric reaction.” 
“But we’re humans!” protested 
Laoconia. “How can. .” 

“And parts of us are still very 
primitive,” said Marie. “This 
shouldn’t surprise us. Sound’s 
been used before to induce the 
first mitotic cleavage in an egg. 
Gafka’s people merely have this 
as their sole breeding method — 
with corresponding perfection of 
technique.” 

Laoconia blinked, said: “I won- 
der how this ever got started?” 
“And when they first en- 
countered our foreign music,” 
said Marie, “it confused them, 



120 



GALAXY 



mixed up their musical relation- 
ships. They were fascinated by 
the new musical forms. They ex- 
perimented for new sensations 
. and their birthrate fell off. 
Naturally.” 

“Then you came along,” said 
Laoconia, “and taught them how 
to master the new music.” 

“Exactly.” 

“Marie!” hissed Laoconia. 

“Yes?” 

“We were right here during 
that entire. You don’t suppose 
that we . that I . .” 

“I don’t know about you,” said 
Marie, “but I’ve never felt more 
certain of anything in my life.” 

QHE chewed at her lower lip, 
^ fought back tears. “I’m going 
to have a baby. Female. It’ll have 
only half the normal number of 
chromosomes. And it’ll be sterile. 
And I. .” 

“Say I to you,” chanted Gafka. 
There was an air of sadness in the 
singsong voice. “Say I to you: all 
life kinds start egg young same. 
Not want I to cause troubles. But 
you say different you.” 

“Parthenogenesis,” said Lao- 
conia with a show of her old 
energy. “That means, of course, 
that the human reproductive pro- 
cess need not . that is, uh . 
we’ll not have to ... I mean to 
say that men won’t be. .” 

“The babies will be drones,” 
said Marie. “You know that. Un- 



fertile drones. This may have its 
vogue, but it surely can’t last.” 
“Perhaps,” said Laoconia. “But 
I keep thinking of all those re- 
broadcasts of our recordings. I 
wonder if these Rukuchp crea- 
tures ever had two sexes?” She 
turned toward Gafka. “Gafka, do 
you know if. .” 

“Sorry cause troubles,” in- 
toned Gafka. The singsong voice 
sounded weaker. “Must say fare- 
well now. Time for birthing me.” 
“You are going to give birth?” 
asked Laoconia. 

“Same,” breathed Gafka. “Feel 
pain on eye-top.” Gafka’s prehen- 
sile legs went into a flurry of 
digging in the ground beside the 
floater. 

“Well, you were right about 
one thing, Dr. Wilkinson,” said 
Marie. “She-he is not a him” 
Gafka’s legs bent, lowered the 
ovoid body into the freshly dug 
concavity in the ground. Immedi- 
ately, the legs began to shrink 
back into the body. A crack ap- 
peared across the vision cap, 
struck vertically down through 
the bellows muscles. 

Presently, there were two 
Gafkas, each half the size of the 
original. As the women watched, 
the two half-sized Gafkas began 
extruding new legs to regain the 
normal symmetry. 

“Oh, no,” whispered Marie. 
She had a headache.

A man who lived three lives? A piker! Jerry 
Norcriss lived hundreds — all over the Galaxy! 
By JACK SHARKEY Illustrated by SCHELLING 



ARCTURUS 

TIMES 

THREE 



L IEUTENANT Jerry Nor- 
criss stood at the edge of 
the wide green clearing, 
sniffing contentedly of the not- 
unpleasant air of Arcturus Beta. 
Three hundred yards behind him, 
crewmen and officers alike la- 
bored to unload the equipment 
necessary for setting up camp for 
this, their first night on the planet. 

No one had asked him to lend 
his strong back to the proceed- 
ings. Space Zoologists were never 
required to do anything which 
might sap, even slightly, any of 
their physical energies. Moreover, 
they were under oath not to take 
any orders to the contrary. 

Now and then, a hot-shot pilot 



would feel resentment at the 
zoologist’s standoffish position, 
and take out his feelings with a 
remark like, “Would you pass the 
sugar, if you don’t think it would 
sprain your wrist, sir?” Such inci- 
dents, if reported back to Earth, 
inevitably resulted in the break- 
ing of the pilot, and his imme- 
diate removal from command. It 
was seldom the zoologist himself 
who made the report. Any crew 
member who overheard such 
statements would make the re- 
port as soon as possible, no mat- 
ter what feelings of loyalty they 
might otherwise have for the pilot 
or person who had spoken. 

From the moment of landing, 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



123 



the lives of every man aboard a 
ship were in the hands of the 
Space Zoologist. 

From Captain Daniel Peters, 
the pilot, down to Ollie Gibbs, the 
mess boy, there was nothing but 
respect for Jerry Norcriss, and no 
envy whatsoever for the job he 
would soon be doing. That is not 
to say they were on friendly terms 
with him, either. 

It was the next thing to im- 
possible to call a Space Zoologist 
“friend.” Even amongst them- 
selves, the zoologists were dis- 
tracted, bemused, withdrawn from 
their surroundings. After their 
first Contact, they never were able 
to join in amiable camaraderie 
with other men. Such social con- 
tact was not forbidden them. It 
was merely no longer a part of 
their inclination. In their eyes a 
cool, silvery light shimmered, an 
inner light that marked them for 
the ultimate adventurers they 
were. No person would ever suf- 
fice them. They lived only for 
the job they did. Without it, few 
lived longer than a terrestrial 
year. Even with it, there was often 
sudden death. 

Jerry was barely thirty, but his 
thick shock of hair was almost 
totally white and his mouth a 
firm line which never curled in 
a smile nor twisted in a frown. 
At the edge of the clearing, his 
bronzed flesh glowing ruddily in 
the failing sunset light of Arc- 



turus, he stood and waited. Off in 
the distance behind him, Daniel 
Peters started across the clearing 
from the sunset-red gleaming of 
the sleek metal spaceship. 

He drew abreast of the solitary 
figure, and said respectfully, “All 
in readiness, sir.” 

The words reached Jerry as 
from across a void. He turned 
slowly to face the other man, fo- 
cusing his will with the effort it 
always took just to use his voice. 

“Thank you, Captain,” he said. 

That was all he said, but as he 
followed Peters across the clear- 
ing toward the scorched circle 
where the great ship had de- 
scended on its column of fire, 
the pilot could not suppress a 
shudder. Jerry’s voice was oddly 
disconcerting to the nervous sys- 
tem of the listener. It seemed 
like the “ghost-voice” of a medi- 
um at a seance. The mind that 
was Jerry Norcriss was only uti- 
lizing a body for the purpose of 
speaking. It did not actually be- 
long there. 

And that was true enough. 
Jerry and the others of his kind 
no longer lived in their bodies. 
They merely existed there, wait- 
ing painfully for the next occa- 
sion of Contact. 

TT>ESIDE the ship’s ladder, 
hooked to an external power- 
outlet beneath a metal flap on 
one towering tailfin, was the 



124 



GALAXY 



couch and the helmet Jerry Nor- 
criss would use. 

Jerry lay back with the ease 
of long habit and adjusted the 
helmet-strap beneath his chin, as 
Peters read to him mechanically. 
The data came from the trans- 
lated resume of the roborocket 
that had gathered data on Arc- 
turus Beta for the six months 
prior to the landing of the space- 
ship. 

“. three uncatalogued species,” 
his voice droned on. “An under- 
ground life-pulse in the swamp- 
lands near the equator; the 
creature could not be spotted 
from the air ... A basically feline 
creature, also near the equator, 
but in a desert region, metabolism 
unknown . And pulses of intel- 
ligent life, and of some unfamiliar 
lower animal life, on the northern 
seas . All other life-forms on 
the planet conform to previously 
discovered patterns, and can be 
dealt with in the prescribed man- 
ners.” 

A small section of Jerry Nor- 
criss’s mind found itself mildly 
amused, as always, by this bit of 
formality. The outlining of the 
planetary reconnaissance to a 
Space Zoologist was mere proto- 
col, a holdover from the ancient 
custom of briefing a man who was 
about to undergo a mission of 
importance. Vainly did the zool- 
ogists try to convince authority 
that this briefing was futile. A 



man in Contact was no longer a 
man. He was the creature whose 
mind he inhabited, save for a 
miniscule remnant of personal 
identity. His job was to Learn the 
creature from the inside out. As 
his mind, off in the alien body, 
Learned, the information was 
relayed via the Contact helmet 
to an electronic brain on the 
ship, to be later translated into 
code-cards for the roborockets. 

Man’s expansion throughout 
the universe was progressing 
faster than his mind could memo- 
rize or categorize. 

The roborockets obviated his 
need to learn. For every known 
kind of alien-species problem, 
there was a solution. The scan- 
nerbeams of the rocket would 
sense each life-form over which 
they passed, in the rocket’s six- 
month orbit about the planet. If 
all species conformed to already 
known types, then a signal would 
fly by ultrawave across the void 
to Earth, declaring the planet fit 
for immediate colonization. But 
if new species were encountered, 
the beam to Earth carried a hur- 
ried call to the Naval Space 
Corps, with a request for the next 
available zoologist. 

Zoologists spent their Earth- 
side time at Corps Headquarters, 
in the Comprehension Chamber. 
There, with the millions of index- 
cards at fingertip control, they lay 
back upon their couches and 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



125 



learned, through dreamlike vicar- 
ious playbacks, about the species 
Contacted by their confreres. Any 
Space Zoologist with even five 
years’ service had more accu- 
mulated knowledge in his brain 
than any dozen ordinary zoolo- 
gists. And more intimate knowl- 
edge, too. A man who has been 
an animal has infinitely more 
knowledge of that animal than a 
man who has merely dissected 
one. 

CO JERRY lay there, letting his 
^ ears record the voice of the 
pilot but closing his conscious 
mind to the import of the words. 
It never did any good to know 
that the creature you were about 
to be was unknown. And no com- 
ment on what sort of animal it 
might be could be half so infor- 
mative as actually being what it 
was. 

Jerry repressed an urge to 
fidget. This was almost the worst 
part of Contact: The wait, while 
the senseless briefing took place. 
Soon enough he would know more 
of the species under observation 
than could be held on ten reams 
of briefing-sheets. Soon enough 
he would be sent, for an irreduci- 
ble forty minutes, into the mind 
of each of the creatures to be 
learned. 

The irreducible time-extent of 
Contact was its primary hazard. 
When the Contact helmet had 



been developed, it had been found 
that approximately forty minutes 
— forty-point-oh-three minutes, 
to be exact — had to be spent in 
the creature’s mind. No amount of 
redesigning, fiddling or tinkering 
could change that time. The Zoo- 
logist could spend neither more 
nor less than that amount in a 
creature’s mind. 

Since all creatures have natural 
enemies, Contact called for more 
than simply curling up and re- 
laxing inside the alien mind. The 
zoologist’s host-alien might have 
a metabolism which called for it 
to drink a pint of water every 
fifteen minutes or shrivel. In 
which case the zoologist would 
shrivel with it, his punishment 
for not sufficiently Learning his 
host. 

This, then, was the reason those 
irreducible forty minutes were a 
hazard. Should the creature be- 
ing Contacted die, the zoologist 
died with it. There was no avoid- 
ing death if it came to the in- 
habited creature. A good zoolo- 
gist Learned fast, or perished. 
Which is why there is no such 
thing as a bad Space Zoologist. 
You’re either a good one or a 
dead one. 

Peters’ voice came to a halt 
and he closed the plastic folder 
over the briefing-sheet. 

“That’s about the size of it, sir,” 
he said. “We’ve focused the Con- 
tact-beams toward the indicated 



126 



GALAXY 



areas and made a final check of 
all the wiring, tubes and power- 
sources.” 

Jerry sighed contentedly and 
shut his eyes. 

“Whenever you’re ready, then, 
Captain,” he whispered, and 
relaxed his body in preparation 
for his first Contact. His mind 
and imagination toyed a moment 
with brief fancies about his forth- 
coming existences in swamp, 
desert and sea, then he pushed 
the thoughts away and let his 
mind go empty. 

Faintly, he heard Peters call- 
ing an order to the technician 
within the spaceship — 

Then silent lightning flashed 
across his consciousness. 

II 

TTE OPENED his eyes. Six 
eyes. In two rows of three 
eyes each. 

He did not, however, see six 
images. The widespread belief in 
the multitudinous images seen by 
the faceted eyes of a housefly 
had been debunked the first time 
a helmeted biochemist had in- 
truded upon that insect’s puny 
brain. As with human eyes, the 
images were fused into a whole 
when they reached the mind. 
Save for the disconcerting sensa- 
tion of possessing a horizontal 
and vertical peripheral vision of 
approximately three hundred 



degrees sight was comfortably 
normal. 

Jerry looked over his surround- 
ings and noted one slightly annoy- 
ing side-effect of his hexafocal 
outlook. As a human will see — 
as when looking at the tip of a 
pencil pointed at the face — two 
images at the far end of any ob- 
ject looked upon, so Jerry, while 
able to zero in anywhere he chose, 
could see six ghost-images cor- 
responding in their angle of per- 
spective to the positions of his 
six eyes. Had he a pencil-tip to 
stare at, it would have appeared, 
beyond the tip, to be vaguely like 
a badminton bird seen head on, 
with images of the pencil-body 
comprising the “feathers.” 

A few moments of glancing 
about soon took care of the 
primary irritation of this unfamil- 
iar sensation, and Jerry began to 
study his surroundings carefully. 

He was inside a circular cavity 
of some sort, facing toward bright- 
ness at the opening ahead of him. 
The walls of the cavity were dark, 
sandy-smooth and slightly moist, 
so he reasoned he was in some 
sort of burrow in the soil. Beyond 
the opening, there was light and 
warmth and a hint of greenery 
which his host’s eyes could not 
bring into sharp focus. 

“I wish I knew my size,” he 
thought. “Am I some small insect 
awaiting a victim, or a rabbit- 
souled mammal hiding from a 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



127 



predator, or a lion-sized carnivore 
sleeping off a heavy meal?” 
Attempts to turn his head for 
a look at his host’s body availed 
him nothing. Jerry relaxed for a 
moment, and tried to sense his 
body by feel. He had, he knew in 
a moment, no neck. Head and 
torso were a one-piece unit, or 
at least inflexibly joined. 

Carefully, Jerry moved his 
right “hand” out before his face 
for a look. He saw a thin, flesh- 
covered bony limb, with a double 
“elbow,” terminating in a semi- 
circular pad which seemed suited 
for nothing but support. No claw, 
talon or digit on the pad; just a 
tesselated rubbery bottom, the 
tesselations apparently acting as 
treads do on a tire. 

“Whatever I am,” Jerry sighed, 
“I’m non-skid.” He considered a 
moment, then added, “I can’t be 
an insect, then. Insects can’t rely 
on weight to keep them rightside 
up, and need gripping mechan- 
isms. Okay, insect-size is out.” 

J ERRY extended the pad before 
him and cautiously leaned his 
weight on it, then removed it 
back beneath his torso and 
studied the earth where it had 
rested. There was a concavity 
there, corresponding to the pad. 
It was not especially deep. 

“Well, that lets out elephant- 
size,” he reasoned, “and most 
oversize forms. I must be some- 



where between a mouse and a 
middle-sized wolf. But what am 
I?” 

Jerry tried breathing. Nothing 
happened; there was no sense of 
dilation anywhere in his body. 
“Odd,” he thought. “Unless I get 
oxygen — or whatever gases this 
creature breathes — through my 
food . Or maybe I have air- 
tubes like an insect’s ... No, I’d 
have to shift my body now and 
then for air circulation, and I feel 
no discomfort remaining still. Be- 
sides, I have flesh, and that tube 
arrangement only functions well 
in a body with an endoskeleton. 
Must be dependent on food in- 
take, then. Stores its oxygen or 
whatever.” 

He extended the tesselated 
pad, and rubbed it cautiously 
against the soil. There was a dim 
sensation of touch in the pad. But 
it was subordinate to a soma-cen- 
tric sense of location. His pad 
“knew” where it was in relation to 
his body, but had no great tactile 
capacity for his surroundings. 
“Well,” Jerry thought, “that lets 
out feeling my body to determine 
shape or function.” 

As it sometimes did when he 
was enhosted, his mind went back 
to old Peters, his instructor, who 
had taught “Project C” to the 
eager young zoologists. Project 
Contact had been mostly devoted 
to giving the student an open 
mind on metabolism and adapta- 



128 



GALAXY 



bility to environment. A Learner 
had to be able to reason out — 
and quickly — the metabolism of 
his host. It was little use know- 
ing a Terran life-ecology; man 
lives on combustibles and oxygen, 
the oxygen combining with com- 
bustibles to provide heat, and 
plants live on carbon dioxide and 
water and sunlight, renewing the 
atmospheric oxygen. So old 
Peters had always stressed the 
student’s learning their Basic 
Combinations. 

Basic Combinations prepared 
the student — or so the school 
board hoped — for a wide variety 
of chemical relationships between 
a host and its environment. The 
students had to know what to do 
to survive should the host, for 
instance, live in a chlorine at- 
mosphere, and need large 
amounts of antimony in its diet 
for proper combustion and sur- 
vival. There were a good many 
chemical elements in the uni- 
verse; the student had to know 
how to deal with any combina- 
tion of them in a host’s metabol- 
ism. 

For the most part, the instincts 
of the host would carry a Learner 
through the Contact period. A 
species tended to keep its physical 
needs not only in its mind, but 
in its body as well. Mr. Peters 
had a saying he’d been fond of 
emphasizing to the students: 
“When in doubt, black out.” The 



saying became a cliche to the 
student body, but they had the 
sense not to disregard it. A cliche 
is, after all, only a truth which 
has become trite because it is 
vitally necessary to use it often. 

“When in doubt, black out,” 
meant simply that if a situation 
arose which seemed impossible to 
handle rationally, the enhosted 
Learner’s last resort was reliance 
upon the instinctive behavior of 
the host. The only thing to be 
done was to pull the mind into a 
tiny knot bobbing in the host’s 
own brain, and let the host itself, 
once more in control, take the 
Learner instinctively to environ- 
mental victory. Or defeat. 

r I ^HERE were dangers, of course. 

A Learner enhosted in a 
chicken, for instance, would be a 
fool to trust the chicken’s instincts 
regarding, say, a snake. A chicken 
confronted by' a snake tends to 
become hypnotized by its deadly 
adversary, and to stand stupidly 
in place until it is killed. In cases 
of that sort, the Learner would 
be safer taking control and going 
clucking off to the nearest high 
ground. 

On the other hand, a Learner 
inhabiting something with the 
hairtrigger instincts of a bat 
would be much better off letting 
the animal’s instincts take over 
in moments of grave risk, such as 
flying through the blades of a 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



129 



revolving fan. A bat could get 
through without a second thought 
about those whirling metal scy- 
thes, but a man’s mind could not 
think fast enough to avoid a grim 
death by all-over amputation. 

“Maybe,” Jerry thought hope- 
fully, “I’ve got an easy one.” It 
was possible, of course. His host 
might be in the midst of an after- 
noon siesta, and Jerry could relax 
and “sit out” his forty minutes of 
Contact. But such cases were few. 
At any moment a predator might 
come down into that orifice in 
the soil, and Jerry would have 
to fight for his host’s life to pre- 
serve his own. Relaxed Learning 
was seldom feasible. 

“I’d better see what sort of 
fighting equipment I have,” he de- 
cided, wishing vainly that he 
could just turn his head and look 
his body over. This proceeding by 
feel was a slow, tortuous, and 
sometimes deceptive process. Hol- 
low fangs that seemed capable of 
injecting venom into an enemy 
might — as in the case of the 
Venusian Sea Vampires — turn 
out to be an organ for drinking 
water, the sacs above the fangs 
being for digesting liquids and 
not for storing poisons. 

Jerry stimulated what should 
be his tongue into action, check- 
ing for the presence of fangs. 
Within the mouth of the creature, 
which felt large in relation to its 
head, he sensed a rasping move- 



ment, a kind of dull dry rustling, 
but could feel nothing with the 
tongue itself. “Best have a look 
at it,” he decided suddenly, and, 
opening his jaws, extended the 
tongue. 

J ERRY was distinctly shocked 
by the thing that skewed and 
writhed forward from beneath his 
eyes. His sensation was not un- 
like that of a man who opens his 
mouth and finds a snake in it. 
And Jerry further realized that 
he was now seeing with another 
sextet of eyes, at the end of the 
tongue. 

He was not one alien — he 
was two! 

His primary six eyes took in 
the pink-and-gray horror extend- 
ing ahead of him. The tongue was 
almost like another animal, ser- 
pentine in construction, and had 
two horny — what? — arms? — 
pincer-jaws? — at either side of 
the “head”. They were tubular, 
like a cow’s horns, and lay at 
either side of a wide slit-mouth 
in the tongue itself. 

On impulse, Jerry Swiveled the 
tip of the tongue back upon itself, 
and gazed through the six eyes 
around the tongue-slit-and-jaws/ 
arms at the main body of his host. 
Then, suddenly feeling ill, he 
snapped the tongue back into his 
mouth and shut his jaws. 

It had been a horrible sight. 
Where he’d expected to see the 



130 



GALAXY 



abdominal region of his host, just 
behind the thoracic section, there 
lay a wet, red concavity, in the 
midst of gaping jaws. Jerry him- 
self was enhosted in a “tongue” 
of some still larger creature 
within that soft earthen burrow! 
And some remaining fragment of 
his host’s awareness told him 
that the creature of whom he 
was the tongue was itself the 
tongue of yet another creature. 
He was a segment of some 
gigantic segmented worm-crea- 
ture whose origin lay who-knows- 
how-far beneath the earth. 

Carefully, stilling a mental 
feeling akin to mal de mer, he re- 
protruded his tongue and looked 
more carefully at it. Sure enough, 
just behind the “head” of the thing 
were two stubby growths, not yet 
mature. In time, Jerry realized, 
those growths would develop into 
a pair of double-elbowed front 
“arms” with semi-tactile tesse- 
lated pads at the base, and the 
curving jaws/arms would drop 
off or be resorbed, while that 
“tongue” extended a “tongue” of 
its own. 

“And then what happens to my 
segment?” he wondered. “Do I 
simply lie here forever with jaws 
agape?” 

As he pondered this, there 
came a movement in the greenery 
just beyond the burrow orifice. 
A squiggly thing with an ill-as- 
sorted tangle of under-append- 



ages came prancing with almost 
laughable ill-balance into view. 
Jerry, intent on observing this 
creature — very like a landbound 
jellyfish walking clumsily upon 
its dangling arms — relaxed his 
vigil as regards control of the 
host. 

Before he realized it, his jaws 
were flung wide, and that self- 
determined tongue was leaping 
for its prey. The horny jaws/ arms 
clamped into the viscous body of 
the passing creature, and the slit- 
mouth extended upper and lower 
lips like pseudopods to cover the 
writhing, squealing victim. Then 
a huge lump appeared in the 
tongue, just behind its “head.” 
Jerry waited with a distinct lack 
of relish for the still squirming 
“meal” to make its alimentary 
way back into his own esophag- 
ous. 

However, it did not. Just short 
of his lips, it halted. And after a 
few moments, it ceased to strug- 
gle. 

Annoyed, but uncertain just 
why he was, Jerry attempted to 
re-mouth his tongue. It did not 
come back. His jaws lay open 
wide, and his tongue remained 
where it had shot forward to grasp 
the tentacled creature. 

Something clicked in Jerry’s 
mind, and he once more tried 
“seeing” out of the tongue’s six 
eyes. He found that he still could, 
but dimly.

It took him about three sec- 
onds to figure out his peril. 

rpHE SEGMENT behind his 
own would never re-swallow 
his segment, which had been its 
tongue. It couldn’t. It was dead. 
For the time-period in which his 
own segment had existed as the 
third segment’s tongue, it had 
some control over it. It could 
extend the tongue, and could see 
through the eyes in the tongue. 
But then Jerry’s segment had 
fed, had grown, and the parent- 
segment had died, as had its 
parent-segments before it. The 
thing, whatever it was, grew fast, 
too. 

That was the frightening part. 

Even while he thought this, he 
saw that the lump was gone from 
his tongue. But his tongue was 
twice the size it had been! 

Repeated efforts on his part to 
withdraw it back within his jaws 
met with failure. Again he tried 
looking through its eyes, and 
found his tongue-vision even dim- 
mer. Then with a tremor of shock, 
he realized that his own vision 
was dimmer, too. 

His host was dying. It was no 
longer needed to house the 
tongue. 

Up ahead of him, the tongue- 
part was digging busily with those 
pincers, erecting for itself an ex- 
tension of the burrow. Like a mole 
in reverse, it did not make a 



mound by tunneling through the 
soil, but by lying atop the soil 
and erecting itself a circular 
tunnel in which to await victims. 

Jerry’s mind brought to him a 
vision of what this section of this 
unknown morass must look like, 
with miles and miles of curving 
tunnels, each housing a hideous 
worm-creature, of whom all seg- 
ments were dead except the front 
one, which would in turn be dead 
as soon as its tongue had fed a bit 
and grown to mature size. 

Shivering within his mind, 
Jerry wondered how much of the 
forty-minute period had gone by. 

He had no way of estimating. 
His personal time-sense was over- 
powered by that of his host. A 
man within a gnat, with the life- 
span of a day, would feel sub- 
jectively that he had lived a life- 
time within it, although only 
those same forty minutes would 
pass by until his return to his 
own body, helmeted upon the 
couch. 

Each new segment might take 
a day to grow, or it might take a 
few minutes. Jerry could not tell. 
He could only wait until he was 
sent to his next Contact. There 
was no method of self-release 
from Contact. That was why sur- 
vival was imperative. 

A flicker of movement caught 
his dimming vision, and he real- 
ized that his tongue had snared 
yet another of the jellyfish-things. 



132 



GALAXY 



The second lump was quickly 
absorbed as he watched, and he 
found he could no longer make 
contact at all with the six eyes 
of the tongue-tip. His own six 
were blurring, with a rapidity he 
was able to observe, and he knew 
that the life of the host could 
not last very long. 

Vaguely, he was aware that the 
stubby growths of his tongue had 
now sprouted into appendages 
such as his own. The tongue could 
no longer be called that, because 
it was nearly a full-grown seg- 
ment. Within it, he imagined, it 
was growing a new tongue of its 
own, the faster to hasten its own 
eventual demise. 

66T’VE got to stop it,” he 
thought. “But how can I? It 
won’t withdraw, no matter how 
hard I try. And if it would, it’s 
grown too large to fit inside my 
jaws any more, even if I tried 
cramming it in with these stupid 
pads of mine . .” 

He stopped the pointless line 
of reasoning and lifted his pair of 
double-elbowed “arms” before his 
failing sextet of eyes. 

“They look strong enough, but 
are they?” 

He could feel his control slip- 
ping. His life would hang upon 
the success or failure of 'his ex- 
periment, but there was no time 
to try and reason out a better 
attempt at survival. 



Swiftly, ignoring the wriggling 
protests of the segment before his 
own, he encircled it tightly with 
those two-jointed “arms” and held 
it tight and painfully taut. It was 
still soft, still relatively raw from 
its rapid growth, and was not 
equipped to fend off attack from 
the rear. Jerry, straining terribly, 
ignoring the searing pain that 
licked his consciousness, cruelly 
and methodically tore out what 
had been his tongue. 

The dripping end of the thing 
flopped once, then lay still. And 
Jerry’s vision, after swimming in 
gray haze for a moment, coal- 
esced once more into sharp focus 
and he knew his host was alive 
again. 

“Whew!” he gasped, grateful to 
shut the great jaws once more. 
“It’ll be tough, but I know how to 
survive, now. My segment’s low 
enough on the evolutionary scale 
to regenerate lost parts; it will 
grow itself a new tongue. If I 
don’t get lifted to a new Contact 
in the meantime, I’ll simply tear 
that one out, too, and hang on 
until I get out of this damned 
thing!” 

Then the segment ahead of him 
moved, and Jerry knew cold fear. 

At the mouth of the burrow, 
one of the squiggly jellyfish-things 
had inserted a tentacle into the 
burrow and was busily ingesting 
the torn-out segment into a gap- 
ing hole in its underside amongst 



134 



GALAXY 



the shiny, wiggling arms. Even as 
he watched, it had completed its 
meal, and with a shiver of gusta- 
tory pleasure, readjusted its rela- 
tive dimensions until it was three 
times its former size. 

“This,” said Jerry, bitterly, “is 
one hell of an ecology. Each crea- 
ture is the other’s chief natural 
enemy!” 

Then his fright grew as he saw 
that the jellyfish — he could no 
longer think of it as anything 
else — was methodically ripping 
down the walls of the burrow, and 
coming for him. 

Frantically, Jerry tried getting 
at the thing with his tongue, but 
the raw stump within his jaws 
was still in the process of gene- 
rating a new head-and-eyes part. 
A mere stub shot forward to wag 
futilely at the approaching 
enemy. 

Jerry shot his tesselated pads 
forward, trying to push and pum- 
mel the thing away, but the few 
blows that landed rebounded 
from that shiny body like pith- 
balls bouncing from an electro- 
static plate. 

Then the jellyfish grappled 
with, and held onto, one of Jerry’s 
arms, and began calmly to tuck it 
into its digestive cavity. If the pad 
had been only lightly tactile be- 
fore, it became supersensitive 
now, as the creature’s digestive 
juices began to erode it into its 
component chemicals. 



Jerry felt as if he’d rammed 
his hand into an open wood fire. 
He tried to scream; nothing 
emerged between his jaws except 
that futile tongue-stump. The 
jellyfish, climbing in a leisurely 
fashion down the limb it was in- 
gesting, flicked out a tentacle and 
began doing something horrible 
to Jerry’s upper right eye. It sent 
waves of pain into his mind, and 
almost blotted out all thought, 
except for a maniac notion that 
urged Jerry to laugh at the 
creature’s ambition. For its 
highly maneuverable tentacle-tip 
was diligently attempting to 
unscrew the eye. 

Jerry’s right arm was gone. 
Tentacles flipped and floundered 
all about his head-section. The 
digestive cavity of the jellyfish 
was widening, trying to take in 
Jerry’s head at a single swallow. 
He saw, with the five usable eyes 
remaining, a crystally concavity, 
the sides glinting with digestive 
fluid tinted beautiful emerald by 
the foliage out beyond its semi- 
transparent body. Then the thing 
closed over his head, and the last 
of the eyes began to sear and 
sting. 

Jerry’s mind cried out in an- 
guish . and lightning flashed 
across his consciousness. White, 
silent lightning. 

Pain ceased. 

The time of Contact had 
passed.

/^APTAIN Daniel Peters paced 
agitatedly back and forth be- 
fore the couch holding that still 
figure in its bulky helmet. The 
last glow of the sunset had 
vanished behind the trees around 
the clearing minutes before. 
Peters took three puffs from a 
just-ignited cigarette, then crush- 
ed the white cylinder under his 
heel. 

“Sir?” said a man at the air- 
lock of the ship. 

Peters looked up swiftly, and 
identified the speaker as the 
technician for the Contact mecha- 
nism. 

“How’s it going?” he asked, try- 
ing to keep his voice matter-of- 
fact. 

“First report’s just come in,” 
said the man, with a brief smile. 
“Information’s being coded onto 
a new card for the roborocket 
index. I guess Norcriss came 
through the Contact all right. His 
life-pulse still shows on the 
panel. It was flickering badly 
for a few minutes, though. Think 
I should terminate?” 

Peters hesitated, then shook 
his head. “No, I guess not. They 
tell me there are no after-effects 
to even a hazardous Contact. Nor- 
criss’ll be wanting to get on with 
it . poor devil,” he added, with 
a wry smile that touched only 



his lips, didn’t reach his eyes. 
“Proceed, seaman.” 

The other man nodded, and 
vanished within the ship . 

IV 

\^AST flat fields of sun-bronzed 
’ stone stretched in all direc- 
tion to the horizon, pockmarked 
with rimless craters, seething with 
red liquid which flickered with 
dusty blue fingers of fire here and 
there on its surface. Every so 
often a pale plume of steamy 
white rose toward the coppery 
overturned bowl that was the 
sky. 

Cautiously Jerry sniffed the air. 
Sulphur. That was the red liquid 
burning in those many pits: Yel- 
low sulphur melted into gluey 
scarlet pools amid the nearly in- 
visible shimmer of its consuming 
fires. 

“Sulphur doesn’t steam,” Jerry 
thought idly, still sniffing at the 
fumes. “So the white plumes 
mean there is water, or some 
volatile liquid, mingled with the 
deposits in these pits.” 

After a moment, he realized 
that he was no longer taking 
random sniffs of the fumes, but 
was actually indulging himself in 
a regular orgy of breathing. The 
smell of the sulphur was as strong 
and piercing as he’d ever known 
it, but absent was the almost 
simultaneous effect of raw throat, 



136 



GALAXY 



streaming eyes, and hacking 
cough. 

“The desert air must be nearly 
all sulphur gases,” he realized. 
That would explain the hue of 
the sky, and the not-unpleasant 
silvery haziness of the atmos- 
phere. 

“And I, if I don’t keel over in 
a few more moments, must be a 
sulphur-breathing creature.” 

Sunlight, from nearly directly 
overhead, was warm and comfort- 
able upon his head, back and 
hindquarters. An unusually flex- 
ible feeling in the caudal region 
of his spine told him that he had 
a tail, even before he swung his 
huge head about for a glance at 
it. The body, as bronzed as the 
rock on which it stood, was some- 
thing like a lion’s, although the 
taloned feet, from heel to the first 
leg-joint, were horny and rough 
in appearance. They were not un- 
like those of a barnyard fowl, if 
considerably thicker and decid- 
edly more lethal. 

That, save for a hard-to-see 
fringe of darker fur that ran up 
his neck toward where he felt his 
ears to be, was all of his body 
that he could view. 

“I wonder,” he mused, “what 
my head looks like?” 

A brief turning of the problem 
in his mind gave him the solution 
to it. It wasn’t the best possible 
way of getting an idea of his latest 
cranial conformations, but — un- 



less there was a looking-glass 
lying about — it was the only way 
at hand. 

Jerry tilted his head until his 
eyes fell upon his shadow on the 
brown rock beneath him. By tilt- 
ing it from one side to the other, 
and joining the various silhouettes 
in his mind by a simple applica- 
tion of basic gestalt, he knew what 
his head looked like. 

Very like a lion’s, except that 
it seemed to have no external 
ear. A single slender silhouette 
that fell from the forehead re- 
gion, stiletto-pointed, must be a 
sort of horn, unless it deciduated 
periodically, like a deer’s antlers. 

P^URTHER speculation on his 
appearance was interrupted 
by the appearance of another 
creature, trotting like a terrier 
between the fuming sulphur-pits, 
coming his way. 

It could be a twin to what he 
now knew he looked like, but it 
seemed just a bit smaller, some- 
how. And it was carrying some- 
thing carefully in its teeth. 

“Should I run, fight or just ig- 
nore it?” Jerry wondered. “It 
doesn’t seem menacing. But 
neither does a Pekinese till you 
try to pet it.” 

He allowed his mind to re- 
treat a fractional bit from con- 
trol of his host, and watched its 
reactions to the newcomer. Jerry 
felt a surge of emotion, a sort 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



137 



of fond, proud, doting feeling, and 
knew that this approaching crea- 
ture was his cub. “That’s a help,” 
he thought, relieved, and resumed 
control of the animal. 

The cub halted a short distance 
away, and gently set its burden 
upon the rock, placing a fore- 
footful of talons upon the thing 
before letting go with its jaws. 
Under the talons, the thing 
moved. Jerry saw that it was a 
sort of squirrel, except that it 
had well-developed forepaws, 
the pads of which hinted that it 
undoubtedly ran quadripedally 
instead of climbing trees. Then 
the memory of the sort of terrain 
he was in re-crossed his mind, 
and Jerry felt foolish. 

Naturally it didn’t climb trees 
in a region that was devoid of 
any vegetation whatsoever. 

Jerry noticed that the cub 
seemed to be waiting for some- 
thing. He wished he could speak. 
He had the goofy feeling that he 
was supposed to say, like a man 
confronted by a bottle of Chateau 
Neuf in the hopeful hands of a 
wine steward, “That’ll do nicely, 
thank you.” 

A nod was almost universally 
a sign of acquiescence, so he tried 
that instead. The cub seemed 
pleased, and immediately, by 
lowering that forehead-horn be- 
tween a pair of the talons en- 
folding the struggling land-squir- 
rel, snuffed out its life with a 



thrust through its neck. Then it 
removed the talons from its prey, 
and took a backward step. 

Apparently, as the sire, Jerry 
was to get first bite. 

“Now don’t go all picayune,” 
he cautioned his digestive tract. 
“Come on, Jerry boy. You eat 
oysters while they’re alive. You 
should be able to eat a squirrel 
when it’s dead. Besides, if you 
like the smell of this lion-crea- 
ture’s atmosphere, you’ll probably 
like the taste of its food. Eat 
hearty.” 

With that, Jerry lowered his 
head and let his sharp teeth snap 
off a haunch of the squirrel-thing. 
He went to ohew it, then realized 
that — unlike his prior Contact’s 
over-equipage — he had no 
tongue. This was strictly a bolt- 
your-food host. So he tossed his 
head back, and managed, with a 
spasmodic effort of his thick 
muscular throat, to get the morsel 
into his stomach. 

The cub stepped forward then, 
bit off a chunk for itself and got 
it down with less apparent effort. 

“Well, he’s had more practice 
at tongueless eating,” Jerry con- 
soled himself. Then, noting that 
the cub was standing patiently 
awaiting something, he swayed 
his head from side to side, try- 
ing to convey, “No thanks, it’s 
all yours, kid.” 

But the cub, its head tipped 
perplexedly to one side, was still 



138 



GALAXY 



watching him, waiting for some- 
thing, a sort of puzzled anxiety 
in its gaze. Jerry reasoned that 
if he simply backed off, the cub 
would take that as a gesture of 
refusal to eat any more, so he 
took a few steps away from the 
squirrel-thing. 

A ND the cub, an almost human 
look of bafflement on its face, 
gurgled a whine from its throat. 
It began to bounce about on its 
legs like a housebroken dog that 
very urgently wants out. 

Jerry thought hard. The fran- 
tic desire of the cub for him to 
do something was more than 
mere pettishness on its part. 
There was real panic in its eyes, 
now. Jerry felt the first thrill of 
danger. What was he doing 
wrong? Or what wasn’t he doing 
right? 

Mere after-you-Pop protocol 
could not explain the glint of 
fright in his cub’s eyes. Or could 
it? 

Jerry tried to remain calm and 
think reasonably. The sire-and- 
cub relationship was throwing 
him. Most animals — in the 
narrow group that remained 
linked by relationship and af- 
fection even after the cubs 
matured — ran along opposite 
lines. The parent went out and 
got food for the kids, and not 
vice-versa. On this planet, ap- 
parently, having a cub was the 



nearest thing to Social Security. 

“Remember, you idiot,” Jerry 
snapped at himself, “this is a 
species. It is no beast rational 
mind you are dealing with, but 
an animal mind. That means 
that the cub’s apparent protocol 
is instinctive, and not a matter 
of etiquette. And an instinct has 
a reason behind it, doesn’t it? 
Only man can skip over protocol. 
You have to do something be- 
fore the cub feels that it can 
do it — and whatever it is 
you’re not doing, it’s driving the 
cub to distraction. You’d better 
go for a second helping of 
squirrel, and fast, or you’re 
going to have your kid in a 
mental institution!” 

Not exactly relishing complet- 
ing the meal, Jerry stepped back 
to the furry little corpse on the 
rock, and only as he came near 
enough to bite into it was he 
suddenly aware of another odor 
mingling with that of the sul- 
phur fumes. Unbelieving, he 
stared at the spreading pool of 
putrescence that ringed the re- 
mains of his cub’s prey. He 
stared, silent and amazed, as 
flesh and bone crumbled and 
dissolved there on the ground, 
until there was nothing there but 
the noissome liquid and a few 
tiny teeth. 

“Incredible!” thought Jerry. 
“To decompose so damned fast! 
But it certainly explains why 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



139 



Junior brought me that thing 
still alive and kicking. It didn’t 
last more than a few minutes 
after it died — Ugh!” 

The sickly retch boiled out 
from his stomach with a painful 
expansion, and he scented the 
same foul odor on his breath 
as arose from the liquid that 
now lay drying in the burning 
sunlight. 

“The damn thing’s going rot- 
ten inside me!” he said to him- 
self, feeling the first wave of 
illness shake him from horn to 
tail-tip. 

His flesh, beneath its bronze- 
colored fur, felt suddenly cold 
and greasy. Jerry knew that feel- 
ing well, from one summer when 
he’d eaten a sandwich with 
mayonnaise that had lain too 
long outside the refrigerator. It 
was the onset of ptomaine. He 
and the cub could be dead, in 
a very ugly manner, within less 
time than he had to await his 
next Contact. Or was it less 
time? It was subjective, wasn’t 
it? Maybe this period would be 
over more quickly than the last 
one. Or maybe more slowly . 

J ERRY turned to look at the 
cub. Its eyes were glazing. It 
was breathing in gasps through 
its open mouth, staggering as it 
tried to remain on its feet. 

“We’re poisoned,” Jerry groan- 
ed. “And it’s not on purpose. 



That cub didn’t trot here with 
that squirrel just to knock off 
its old man! There’s something 
else has to be done, something 
I’ve overlooked. And my stupid- 
ity is killing us.” 

Weakly, almost automatically, 
Jerry’s conscious mind did the 
only thing possible under the 
circumstances. Cliche of old 
Peters or not, “When in doubt, 
black out” was the only solu- 
tion. Jerry swiftly relinquished 
his grip on the controls, and let 
the lion-thing take over its own 
destiny. 

The first thing it did was 
rush toward the scarlet surface 
of the boiling sulphur pit near 
the cub. The muscles relaxed 
and showed no sign of relaxing 
in that flame-bound gallop, and 
Jerry grabbed at its mind and 
got back in control just as its 
forefeet stood on the brink of 
that blue-flaming red pool. 

“Oh, damn!” he groaned, ago- 
nized by both his fear of fire 
and the growing discomfort with- 
in his stomach. “Of all the crea- 
tures in the universe, I have to 
hit one with the lemming-in- 
stinct. This damn thing’s bent on 
boiling itself alive if I let go. 
And if I stay in control, I die of 
ptomaine!” 

Jerry Norcriss wasted nearly 
thirty seconds feeling sorry for 
himself. And then he remem- 
bered something about lem- 



140 



GALAXY 



mings. And also something about 
cubs. 

Lemmings, those strange little 
rodents that take it periodically 
in their heads to all go rushing 
into the ocean and drown, are 
not suicide-bent. Their ancestry 
is older than the continent on 
which they live. At one time the 
spot wherein they plunge into 
the ocean was linked with the 
next continent over. The migra- 
tion — for that’s what it is with 
lemmings — had at one time 
been perfectly safe. So safe that 
the migration of the lemmings 
became instinctive. And, after 
the continents separated, or the 
band of land joining them sank 
beneath the sea, the lemmings 
blithely continued their trek, and 
perished. Lemmings might die, 
but the ages-old instinct of the 
specie wouldn’t. 

No animal, Jerry realized, is 
deliberately self-destructive. No 
animal but man — who is more 
than animal, and can decide 
upon his own destiny despite 
what his instincts buck for. 

And cubs, Jerry recalled with 
chagrin, are not always born 
knowing survival-tactics. Some 
cubs have to be taught how to 
survive. And this one is still in 
the process of learning, and only 
senses that — since it is becom- 
ing deathly ill — something is 
horribly wrong. It wants its sire 
to show it survival, and its sire 



is in the hands of a nincompoop 
like me . 

T^ORTUNATELY for Jerry and 
the cub, his thoughts on cubs 
and lemmings lasted only a frac- 
tional second, so all-inclusive is 
the mind’s apprehension of a 
situation. 

And then Jerry, feeling greatly 
relieved, let go of the controls 
once more and let the lion-thing 
bend and drink from the blazing 
sulphur-pool at its feet. 

Of what the host was con- 
structed, Jerry had no idea. Its 
cell-structure might be high in 
silicates, or possibly be akin to 
asbestos. Whatever it was, the 
blazing red sulphur went down 
its gullet like sweet warm wine, 
and the decaying squirrel-thing 
was transformed into chemicals 
that were comfortably digestible. 

Jerry was glad to see that the 
cub, standing on shaky legs, was 
drinking, too. It seemed likely 
to survive its brush with death. 

Not a bad life, he thought. 
Catch a meal, take a swig of 
wine and then just loaf around 
in the sun. Nice planet ... if 
you like sulphur, and have a 
bright-eyed young kid who won’t 
make a move without your ap- 
proval and example — 

Jerry’s ruminations were cut 
short by a sound of leathery 
wings, high in the coppery sky. 
Abruptly alert, he lifted his 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



141 



shaggy head and saw an ominous 
formation of Vs in the sky. They 
grew in size, and became the 
forms of gigantic airborne things, 
a cross between the ancient Ter- 
ran pterodactyl and a sort of 
saber-toothed ape. 

Something told him these ap- 
proaching things were not 
friendly. 

He turned his head to the 
cub, but this, apparently, was a 
lesson already learned, because 
all he saw of his scion was a 
disappearing blur of buttocks 
and tail as the cub scurried in 
a clumsy gallop across the plains 
of sunburnt rock. In another 
instant, Jerry was scurrying right 
after him, for reasons above and 
beyond Togetherness. 

The paws wouldn’t manage 
right, so he finally dropped back 
a bit and let the lion-thing’s 
brain take over the job of 
escape, his own mind merely 
going along for the ride. 

“But where can we hide?" he 
wondered, fascinated despite his 
fear. “Can we pull the hollow 
reed routine under the surface 
of a sulphur-pit? Or are there 
caves someplace in the vicinity? 
Or do we just run until either 
our legs or those simianipters’ 
wings give out?” 

Then his mind got entangled 
with the purely empirical cogi- 
tation about the validity of coin- 
ing a word like simianipters 



(which seemed to mean “ape- 
winged” when the coinage he de- 
sired was “winged-apes”) and his 
mind was bouncing so busily be- 
tween this knotty problem and 
the chances of escape from those 
creatures and the puzzle of just 
what constituted safety from the 
flying things that he barely 
noticed the white flash of silent 
lightning that heralded cessation 
of Contact.

ii/^ONTACT completed,” said 
the technician to Peters, in 
the purple twilight slowly deep- 
ening to black starry night. 
“Slight dimming of Norcriss’s 
life-pulse this time, not so bad as 
last time.” 

Peters nodded as he ripped 
open a fresh packet of cigarettes. 
“Machine functioning properly?” 
“Yes, sir,” the technician 
nodded. “Norcriss could go on 
at least three more Contacts 
with the power we have left. 
Shall I activate him again, sir?” 
“Go ahead,” murmured Pe- 
ters, his eyes fastened on the 
pallid face of the young man 
on the couch .

and that in turn meant intel-

ligence. Yet he couldn’t inhabit 
an intelligent mind! 

Jerry opened his eyes and 
took in the scene before him. 
His vista was oddly diverted into 
vertical panels, and then, as his 
mind settled into full control, he 
knew that the panels were 
spaces between bars. 

The thought crossed his mind 
that bars must be vertical every- 
where in the universe. Horizon- 
tal ones would hold a prisoner 
as well, but the origin of bars 
lay in primitive stockades, 
stakes plunged into the ground 
about a prisoner. Primordial 
tribal habits were not easily 
broken, even after attainment of 
civilization. 

Through the bars he saw — 
well — men. They were at least 
bipedal, and walked upright, and 
had two upper limbs with facile 
digits at the ends, all in keeping 
with the nearly universal rule of 
bilateral identity. 

Beyond that, the resemblance 
to man ceased. 

The creatures he saw were 
clothed in satiny uniforms, yet 
something about the material 
told him it would hold up under 
heavy stress. Wherever their 
actual bodies showed — head 
and hands, mostly, though a 
man of apparently lesser rank 
was bared to the waist, working 
on a machine set against one 
wall — they were covered with 



short (or cropped) white down. 
Jerry could detect on the heads 
no sign of ears or nose, but in 
the midst of the furry expanse 
of face, tiny green-glinting beads 
of jet were eyes, and a thin, 
wide blue-gray slit further down 
was the mouth. 

The hands, he noted with in- 
terest, were furred even within 
the palms. Or so he thought until 
one of the creatures, idly flexing 
a hand, showed Jerry that the 
fingers bent on double joints in 
either direction. There were no 
nails as such, but each digit on 
those deceptively soft-looking 
hands terminated in a tapering 
cone of some hard black mate- 
rial, as shiny as the eyes in those 
coconut-frosted faces. 

Jerry once more had cause to 
regret the impossibility of Con- 
tact within a mind of an intel- 
ligent creature. Intelligence 
equated with impenetrability, so 
far as Contact went. You could 
learn of an intelligent race only 
so much as their words and 
gestures and behavior cared to 
let you know. 

Jerry knew he was in a sea- 
region, but whether over it, on 
it, or under it — No. The room, 
so far as he could see, was 
windowless. It could mean that 
the vehicle was carrying its own 
atmosphere, in order to keep the 
riders alive, whether the outside 
surface of the ship were within 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



143 



inimical gases or liquids, or the 
deadly nothingness between 
planets. 

Then again, he might simply 
be within a fortress, or below 
sea-level in a ship. Jerry gave it 
up, and concentrated on himself, 
and his barred container. 

f'pHE CAGE was as high as 
one-fourth the height of any 
of the men before it, so Jerry 
reckoned his own size as about 
one-sixth. If they were all six- 
footers, then he must be about 
rabbit-sized. He glanced down 
his body and saw hard gray 
scales over a curving belly, with 
a pair of hind feet that seemed 
to be all phalanges and no 
metatarsals. From “heel” to foot- 
tip, Jerry had three long, hard- 
looking black spikes. “Something 
like a swan’s foot with the web- 
bing removed,” he mused. 

A look at his forepaws before 
his face showed him three simi- 
lar phalanges, though only two- 
thirds the length of the hind 
ones, and having in addition a 
sort of stubby rudimentary 
thumb. His forearms were scaly, 
too, and possessed a wicked 
spur of the same black material 
jutting downward from the 
elbow. 

Happily, three sides of his 
cage were polished metal walls, 
so he was able to get an inkling 
of his facial characteristics in the 



warped uncertain mirror of the 
surfaces. He saw startled-looking 
eyes, round as quarters, with red 
irises that dilated greatly with 
each tilt of his head toward the 
shadowy rear of the cage, and 
narrowed the orifice about the 
pupil to a pinprick when he 
turned near the front. He seemed 
to be noseless, also. When he 
tried to sniff, nothing hap- 
pened. The attempt made his 
head feel stuffed up, but he knew 
that the feeling was only inside 
his mind, and not an actual sen- 
sation. 

Jerry looked at his mouth. It 
was just a wide slit in his round, 
earless head — no, not earless; 
there were auricular holes under 
a flange of gray scale — just a 
wide slit with a glint of sharp- 
pointed bright orange teeth. 

“Well,” he thought, “I’m at 
least a carnivore, possibly an om- 
nivore, with teeth like that. The 
light in this room is apparently 
not intolerable to those fur-faces 
out there. So — if the slight 
shooting pains in my head plus 
the shutting of the irises when I 
face into the room are any 
criteria — I must be a nocturnal 
beast of some kind. Eyes like 
this would be blinded by sun- 
light.” 

He decided he was, in the 
ecology of the fur-faces, some- 
thing along the lines of a rac- 
coon, even if his flesh were 



144 



GALAXY 



scaly as a pangolin’s. “Maybe 
I’m a pet,” he hoped. “But there’s 
something about the atmosphere 
of this room — ” 

Something rustled and clacked 
against the wall of his cage. 

Jerry withdrew his control a 
fraction to let the host’s mind 
tell him what it might be. The 
mind of his host was atingle 
with antagonism. Yet, as Jerry 
heard a similar movement some- 
where off to the far side, the 
mind of his host grew suddenly 
tender and excited. 

Jerry re-assumed control, hav- 
ing the information he needed. 
His cage was one of at least 
three, possibly many more, hous- 
ing animals like the one enhost- 
ing him. The nearby cage con- 
tained an animal of his own sex, 
the other contained an animal 
of the opposite sex, possibly a 
mate. Whether male or female, 
Jerry had no idea. He had in 
any Contact — barring a pro- 
creative arrangement beyond the 
simple bisexual — a fifty-fifty 
chance of being male. The worm 
had been self-generating, the uni- 
cornate lion-thing had been male. 
What Jerry’s present sex was, he 
had no idea. Even on Earth, 
scaly creatures tended to baffle 
all but the experts as to sex. 
Jerry inspected the mind of his 
host for a few moments, but 
could find out only that it 
yearned for that other one in 



the other cage. The intensity of 
the yearning gave no clue 
if the urge were man-for-woman, 
woman-for-man, mother-for-child, 
child-for-parent or — it was 
barely possible — friend for 
friend. 

Jerry decided to ignore the 
yearning by taking full control 
of the host once more. He took 
stock of his circumstances. Here 
he was, a nocturnal carnivore, 
caged with many of his own 
kind in a vehicle moving through 
space or water. 

He was not just there for the 
ride, that was certain. 

Being delivered somewhere? 
No, the room beyond the bars 
looked little like a storage hold. 
Of course, these fur-faces might 
have alien ideas about the way 
a storage hold should look. Still, 
they seemed to be bosses of 
some kind. There was no mistak- 
ing the dressy look of their uni- 
forms. A high-ranking officer 
might go into a storage hold, 
but it would be for an inspec- 
tion only, and these creatures 
were busily doing something in 
the center of the room. 

nPHERE were three of them, 
discounting the bare-to-the- 
waist man working on that odd- 
looking machine. They stood by 
some waist-high object — two 
with their backs to Jerry, one 
in profile — very intently ab- 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



145 



sorbed in something on that sur- 
face. 

Jerry twisted his head about, 
but could make out no relevant 
details on that surface. “They 
could be studying a map laid 
out on a table,” he pondered, 
curiously. “Or maybe they are 
shooting dice at a crap table, 
or — ■” 

Further conjecture was sud- 
denly, and horribly, obviated. 

The man at the wall straight- 
ened up from his labors and 
announced something, unintel- 
ligible to Jerry (the voice was 
an unbroken hum that rose and 
fell in pitch, unarticulated into 
consonants or vowels), which 
undoubtedly meant, “She’s all 
fixed.” The fur-face in profile 
turned with quick attention and 
stepped to the machine. He 
pulled from its slot a thing like 
the cable-supported arm of a 
small crane terminating in a 
cone-shaped flexible surface, and 
arranged it over the thing on the 
table which his movement to 
the machine had exposed to 
Jerry’s gaze. 

The thing on the table was 
the face of another of the white- 
furred men, and Jerry suddenly 
knew that this was an operating 
room. These men were doctors, 
involved in surgery. 

The machine, so hastily re- 
paired, was some sort of anes- 
thetizing gadget They’d had to 



wait for it before proceeding. All 
this information Jerry worked 
out with only a small part of 
his mind; the majority of his con- 
centration was focused upon the 
other thing he’d seen upon the 
table, strapped wide-eyed into 
position beside the patient. 

It had scales, sharp orange 
teeth, and might have been a 
rabbit-sized cross between a 
raccoon and a pangolin, and the 
wide eyes were tightly irised into 
discs of coppery red, with no 
visible pupils, under the light 
that overhung the operating 
table. 

“What the hell is going on 
here?” Jerry thought, with dis- 
may. “Surgery? In the same 
room with cages full of animals? 
What about sanitation? What 
about infection? The doctors are 
maskless. The room is only pas- 
sably clean — certainly not 
scoured with green soap, alcohol 
or live steam. And that repair- 
man is standing beside the table 
scratching his stomach!” 

Bewildered, yet drawn to 
watch with morbid fascination, 
Jerry ignored the pain that star- 
ing into the room brought to his 
eyes, and gave full attention to 
the proceedings. 

HTHEY were — from a raccoon/ 
pangolin’s viewpoint — pretty 
ghastly. The men, muttering to 
each other as medics the uni- 



146 



GALAXY 



verse over must while engaged 
in surgery, started snipping and 
plucking and sawing and clamp- 
ing with lackadaisical facility 
upon the two bodies strapped to 
the table. One medic concen- 
trated upon the man, the other 
upon the animal, while the an- 
esthetist merely held the cone 
lightly upon the patient’s face, 
and glanced now and then at 
dials upon the machine proper, 
as if for reassurance, or possibly 
to show that they were efficient 
and well-trained. 

They did not trouble to an- 
esthetize the animal. 

As they shifted about in their 
work, Jerry got a better look at 
the patient. All along his chest 
and belly, the white fur was 
gone. From the edges of the 
empty region, Jerry could see 
that the fur had been scorched 
away. The surviving fur in the 
periphery was stunted and slight- 
ly carbonized. The “flesh” be- 
neath that exposed region was 
smooth, excepting a few blistered 
spots near the center. It resem- 
bled thin, flexible green plastic, 
of the sort that seems to be 
translucent, but is actually trans- 
parent, the darkness of the color 
tending to make it seem opaque 
unless light could be placed di- 
rectly behind it. Into this sur- 
face went the scalpels and 
clamps and pins of the medics, 
until they had a triangular flap 



lying back to expose the organs 
within. 

Jerry, well-versed in all the 
metabolisms available to the 
scientists of Earth, was com- 
pletely baffled by this one. None 
of the internal organs was 
fastened to anything. 

The abdominal hollow of the 
creature was filled with a clear 
lemon-colored liquid. The organs 
just floated within the liquid. 
They were, Jerry noticed with 
amazement, not even juxtaposed 
with any sort of permanence. 
Even as the medic reached for 
them, they bobbed and moved 
about each other in the yellow 
fluid, as impermanent of locale 
as apples in a rainbarrel. 

Then Jerry had it. 

“They’re colloidal!” he gasped 
within his mind. “A tough, 
flexible outer shell! The whole 
thing hollow from cranium to 
fingertip to toe, containing a 
liquid that acts as reagent, cata- 
lyst, suspensor and electrolyte 
for the mineral crystals, cell 
globules and chemical coagulates. 
These fur-faced creatures are 
nothing more than ambulant, in- 
telligent hunks of protein! The 
whole setup’s there. The lemon- 
colored fluid is the dispersion 
medium, and those ‘organs’ 
they’re lifting out are the dis- 
perse-phase. But . what do 
they need the raccoon/pangolin 
for?”

His fellow-creature, hissing in 
agony, was already a glittering, 
almost formless thing under the 
grisly tools of the medic stand- 
ing over it. 

It was, Jerry realized, being 
laid belly-open with no more 
regard than is given a lobster’s 
tail-muscle by the gourmet with 
his tiny three-pronged fork. 

Jerry could only watch and 
wonder and wait to see the use 
to which the animal would be 
put. He had not long to wait. 

/~VNCE laid open, the animal’s 
internal fluid, a pale gray 
solution, was sucked out into a 
bulb-headed tube, much as a 
housewife gets the turkey-drip- 
pings from under the bird for 
basting. The fluid was dribbled 
into a row of transparent jars 
with calibrated sides, some get- 
ting more, some getting less. 
Then a drop of liquid — a 
brown liquid for this one, a red 
for that one, and so on — was 
added to each. While Jerry 
gazed at the scene, fighting the 
headache that began to grow 
with the brightness of the lights 
over the operating table, the med- 
ic captured each jar and gave it 
a sharp, practiced shake. 

And then the whole picture 
was clear to Jerry. 

“Crystal-clear,” he said, with 
bitter humor. 

For that was the answer. The 



fur-faces were colloidal, the rac- 
coon/ pangolins were crystalloid. 
Whatever fluid lay within the 
bellies of the animals, it was a 
super-saturate, needing but the 
right chemical additive before 
coming out of its liquid state to 
form the right crystals. 

In each jar, almost instantly 
after shaking, bright crystals had 
begun to form within the liquid. 
Within but a few moments, the 
jars were being uncapped and 
the medics, with neat little tongs, 
were lifting the crystals from 
the solutions and placing them 
within the abdominal cavity of 
their anesthetized patient. The 
flap was fastened down into 
place with a gadget that seemed 
to work on the principle of a 
soldering iron. As it slid along 
the angled edges of the incision 
the sides met and fused, leaving 
only a tiny ridge to attest to 
the fact of the operation. 

One of the medics nodded to 
the bare-to-the-waist creature 
still standing by. The man 
shoved over a wheeled cart, 
slipped the patient onto it and 
wheeled him out of the room 
through an archway barely 
within Jerry’s field of vision. 

Jerry’s main concern, however, 
was for the fate of the crystalloid 
creature, lying so still upon the 
table. One of the medics undid 
the straps across the body, lifted 
it by a hind leg and shoved it 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



149 



through a hinged metal flap 
against the wall, then stabbed a 
button . 

A red flare went off beyond 
the still oscillating metal flap, 
and Jerry had all the informa- 
tion he needed. A nice little in- 
cinerator, for hollowed-out corp- 
ses. 

“I wonder,” Jerry thought 
dismally, “how long my forty 
minutes will take in this Con- 
tact!” His headache was grow- 
ing worse, and it wasn’t just from 
the lights. 

At that moment, a sudden 
lurch sent him crashing against 
the wall of the cage. A clamor 
of alarm bells began throughout 
the vessel. 

One of the medics yelled 
something, and threw a switch 
against the wall opposite that 
housing the anesthetizing ma- 
chine. A panel slid away, reveal- 
ing a large mosaic of close- 
packed little spheroids. As the 
medic twisted a dial at the base 
of this arrangement, some of the 
spheroids began to flicker 
whitely, while others remained 
dark. 

Then Jerry recognized it for 
what it was. A form of tele- 
vision screen, composed of 
individual lights instead of phos- 
phorescing dots activated by 
magnetically guided electrons 
from a cathode. The effect was 
the same. 



A picture, sharply etched by 
the alternation and varying in- 
tensities of the bulbs, appeared 
on the mosaic-screen. Across the 
dream-like surging of the black- 
gray-and-white heavy seas in the 
foreground, Jerry made out an 
armada of strange-looking ves- 
sels coming across the -ocean 
toward wherever the pickup 
camera lay. Unlike Earth-ves- 
sels, they tapered inward as the 
sides of the vessels rose from the 
waters, then were abruptly 
truncated near what would have 
been a peak by a railinged area 
that was the deck. 

“Unless I’m much mistaken,” 
thought Jerry, grimly, “I am on 
a ship which — be it alone or 
one of many in a convoy — is 
about to be attacked by those 
vessels out there.” 

A SECOND later he knew he 
was right. 

From the approaching fleet 
there had come no sign of ar- 
mament, no flash or flame or 
belch of smoke or blaze of ray, 
but the room he was in jolted 
violently, then canted crazily for 
a sick moment before righting 
itself. The alarm bells grew 
louder in their metallic clangor. 

Footsteps pounded down the 
corridor. The bare-to-the-waist 
man or another like him — Jerry 
could not distinguish between 
the creatures — came into the 



150 



GALAXY 



room shouting something. The 
surgeons shouted back and then 
the man raced out again. 

Another jolt made the room 
tremble, but this time it felt 
different, as though the room 
were built to take that sort of 
stress. Jerry recognized that his 
ship was in the process of firing 
back, with whatever strange 
weapons these fur-faces em- 
ployed. Even as he reasoned this 
out, one of the enemy vessels 
on the screen shuddered, split 
into almost-matching halves and 
plunged beneath the waves amid 
much flame and confusion. 

The medics were not watch- 
ing. One of . them had moved out 
of Jerry’s view and now stepped 
back into it, carrying the wrig- 
gling form of one of the animals 
from the cages. As Jerry 
watched, the animal, its orange 
teeth snapping vainly at those 
hard black fingertips on the 
medic’s white-furred hands, was 
lashed to the table in the gray- 
smeared spot where its prede- 
cessor had perished. Then the 
bare-chested man was coming 
back into the room, wheeling a 
man on a cart. This one was 
missing fur from an arm and 
part of the chest area. Jerry was 
able to confirm his earlier theory 
that the hollowness of the crea- 
tures was extended throughout 
the flexible green body-sheaths. 

“Sonics,” thought Jerry, all at 



once. “They’re using sonic rays 
on each other. A good dose of 
heavy infravibration could ruin a 
collodial creature! The loss of 
the fur through subsonic friction 
is only a side-effect. The main 
damage is the breakdown of 
those colloid organs when the 
beam focuses on a man.” 

That would explain the way 
the other ship had simply sun- 
dered. Artificially induced metal- 
fatigue, by the application of 
controlled vibration. 

“Damn,” thought Jerry, “this is 
dangerous!” 

Other alien vessels were 
visible now on that granulated 
“screen,” heading away from the 
camera. At least Jerry’s ship was 
not alone in the face of that 
armada. His ship was one of at 
least a dozen — with more, pos- 
sibly, outside the pickup range 
of the camera — involved on 
his side of the battle. Some of 
them shattered silently apart 
and boiled into the churning 
waters with a violence so great 
that Jerry could “feel” the sound 
with his eyes. 

Apparently the medics, while 
anxious about the course of the 
fray, did not want their surgical 
endeavors bothered with the ac- 
tual noise of the battle. Or per- 
haps the technology which had 
evolved this type of TV screen 
had never stumbled upon the 
familiar-to-Earth methods of

transmitting sound by electro- 
magnetic radiation. 

64TTOW long can forty minutes 
last?” Jerry wondered in 
growing concern. By his own 
time-sense, warped by the life- 
span of his host, he felt he’d 
been present in that room well 
over an hour. And still he was 
captive to the environment of 
the scaly crystalloid raccoon/ 
pangolin creature, and doubly 
imperiled of survival. Even if 
“his” side took the lead in the 
struggle, many fur-faces would 
need this treatment — which 
destroyed one of his species with 
each operation. 

Jerry did not know whether 
or not the animals were chosen 
in any special order. But his 
mind told him that even were 
his host the last so chosen, his 
odds for survival were dwindling 
fast. 

Assuming the wall against 
which his cage was stacked with 
the others were the same size as 
the wall opposite his cage — 
and symmetrical construction of 
rooms seemed a strong likeli- 
hood — then, judging by his 
cage-size, the maximum number 
of cages that could be so stacked 
was six high and four across, or 
twenty-four cages. Figuring one 
animal per cage, that left some 
twenty-one animals ahead of 
him. 



Possibly — barely possibly — 
this tier of cages might not be 
against a wall. It might be the 
forefront of hundreds of rows of 
similar stacked cages. But no 
medic hurrying to save a life 
would walk to Row #2 when 
Row # 1 was still undepleted. 

“So if I just sit here,” he 
thought, gloomily, “I’m bound to 
end up alongside a fur-face on 
that table. My life gone so that 
his may survive. ‘It is a far, far 
better thing I do’ and so on, but 
I don’t know as I’m ready to lay 
down my life for a fur-face 
without even being given the 
choice, damn it! Let’s figure a 
way out of this mess!” 

The ship went whooomp, sud- 
denly. The room gave a crazy 
tilt again before — rather slug- 
gishly, Jerry noted with alarm 
— righting itself. At the same 
moment the TV screen blanked 
out. 

“Well, there goes the camera,” 
he thought, his insides feeling 
oddly cold and upset. “That may 
mean that if I don’t die on the 
operating table, I may well be 
forced to succumb to a watery 
grave. Damn! When will those 
forty minutes be up?” 

He was jerked from his 
thoughts by the appearance of 
a huge white-furred hand fum- 
bling with the catch on his cage. 

Hard, pointed black fingertips 
reached in through the opened 



152 



GALAXY 



door for him. Jerry snapped and 
clacked his teeth upon them in 
vain, as he was carried toward 
the strap-sided concavity beside 
a new fur-scorched patient on 
the operating table. 

“Use your head!” he screamed 
at himself. “These fur-faces aren’t 
expecting an intelligent attack 
from a lab-animal! The other 
crystalloid creatures have the 
paltry instinctive self-preserva- 
tion mechanism to bite at the 
objects gripping them, those im- 
pervious black fingertips. But 
you know better, right?” 

And with that thought, Jerry 
tilted his head just a bit further 
forward, and let his orange fangs 
crackle through the thin chitin- 
ous green “flesh” beneath the stiff 
white fur on the alien’s wrist . 

'V7’ELLOW dispersion-medium 
A spurted with a satisfactory 
gush from the scalloped gap in 
the alien’s forearm. 

Jerry landed nimbly on his 
hind feet on the metal floor as 
the shrieking medic dashed to 
a confrere for whatever first aid 
is given when a colloidal crea- 
ture’s liquid contents are spilling 
out. 

While a minor part of his 
mind wondered idly if they’d 
employ a tourniquet or just a 
cork, the rest of his mind con- 
centrated on directing those fore- 
paw-and-foot phalanges to carry 



him swiftly up the face of the 
stacked cages. There were 
twenty-four of them, all right, 
against the wall. He perched pre- 
cariously on the top, in the cage- 
roof-to-ceiling space that was too 
small for another layer of the 
same. 

As the fur-face medic fiddled 
around with the wrist of the 
man Jerry had bitten (it was 
the raccoon/pangolin medic, of 
course), the anesthetist dragged 
a small stool over to the base 
of the stacked cages and began 
climbing up after him. 

“Oh, hell,” thought Jerry, cow- 
ering weakly against the wall. “If 
I had a piece of chalk or a char- 
coal stick I could write some- 
thing. Or draw a picture, maybe, 
on the ceiling. Then they’d know 
I was intelligent, and — They’d 
probably use me anyhow. The 
middle of a battle is no time 
for writing learned scientific 
papers about new zoological 
‘finds.’ ” 

Those black fingertips were 
coming for him, too carefully for 
a repeat wrist-crunching perform- 
ance. If he were taken this time 
the bearer would handle with 
care. 

Jerry skittered and scrabbled 
for the corner near the wall, 
hoping to engage the anesthetist 
in a game of you-climb-up-at- 
fhis-point-and-I-run-back-to-fhaf- 
point. But the fur-face had too 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



153 



long a reach to make it practical. 
As Jerry cowered helplessly, 
those black fingertips gripped 
him about the throat with 
strangling force. It apparently 
made no difference if he died on 
the top of the cages or under 
the scalpel. He could only fend 
feebly with his paws at the crea- 
ture as he was lifted down to 
the table and set into the con- 
cavity, dizzy and sick. 

“White lightning?” he begged. 
“Come on, white lightning! 
Please, test, be over. How long 
can forty minutes last?” 

Then the room gave a horrible 
shudder and all the lights went 
out. 

Jerry, not yet strapped in 
place, heard the cries of the 
medics, and then the terrifying 
sound of rushing seas in the in- 
visible corridor as the room 
canted swiftly onto its side. This 
time it did not right itself. A 
thick, falling-elevator feeling 
bunched up inside Jerry. He 
knew that the warship was plung- 
ing beneath the heaving surge 
outside. 

He scrambled about on the 
floor — no, it was the wall now 
— almost brained by the crash- 
ing bulk of the operating table. 
He kept jumping futilely up- 
ward, hoping somehow to escape 
to the corridor and get outside 
the ship before all that water got 
inside this room. 



Then icy tons of fluid crashed 
down upon him, flattening him 
against the wall beneath his feet. 
The cries of the medics were 
suddenly gurgles, then a brief, 
faintly heard sound of bub- 
bling. 

Jerry, trying to swim against 
the swirling pressures of the 
flood that now lifted him from 
against the wall and spun him 
end over end, could hold his 
breath no longer. 

In despair, he felt his jaws 
widen and take in the chill liquid 
in which he was whirled. 

It went in without gagging 
him, and did not come out. Not 
through his mouth, at any rate. 
It came out through long slots 
just in front of those auricular 
vents in his head. 

Gills! Jerry was an amphibian. 

Webbing, hitherto folded away, 
appeared on his feet. “I’ll be 
damned,” he sighed, with weary 
relief. 

Then he paddled determinedly 
about in the utter blackness until 
he found a cage lying on its side, 
the door sprung open. Jerry got 
inside, closed the door until it 
caught as well as its broken 
catch would allow and settled 
himself for a nice wait. 

“At least I won’t have to 
worry about getting gobbled by 
a natural underwater enemy,” he 
figured. 

He had to wait another sub- 



154 



GALAXY 



jective hour before the silent 
flash of white lightning lifted 
him out of his third, and last, 
Contact on Arcturus Beta. 

VII 

Ci ALL right, sir?” asked Pe- 
ters, removing the bulky 
helmet with care. 

Jerry sat up and nodded, 
blinking his eyes as he adjusted 
to his body once more. He was 
hard-pressed not to start testing 
his own joints and lungs and 
limbs for knowledge, and had to 
forcibly remind himself that this 
frail shell was his “normal” body. 

Now to await the technician’s 
analysis of the data. 

Jerry, waving off Peters’ hand, 
outstretched in automatic offer 
of assistance, sat up wearily on 
the edge of the couch. After a 
deep breath he got to his feet. 
Within the ship, the data-analy- 
zer clattered busily. 

“Some hot coffee, sir?” asked 
Peters, helpfully. 

Jerry was annoyed at the ef- 
fort it cost him just to talk. 
“That will go nicely, Captain,” 
he managed. 

The technician leaned out the 
airlock door, his homely face 
split in a grin. “No problem with 
the aliens, sir,” he said to Peters. 
“Amiability indeterminate, but 
their basic weapon is infrasonics. 
They’re built like hard bubbles, 



sure suckers for bayonets or bul- 
lets. I don’t think, with sonic- 
shields, we’ll have much trouble 
with them.” 

Peters, in the process of pour- 
ing Jerry’s coffee, shrugged. 
“Well, we’re not here to make 
trouble, either. The roborocket 
reported that the aliens live 
either at sea or at least always 
in coastal regions. They shouldn’t 
object to our starting a settle- 
ment this far inland.” 

“And,” said Jerry, suddenly, as 
he took the coffee and sipped at 
the hot brown liquid, “I suppose 
those worm-creatures and the 
horned lions are to be elimin- 
ated?” 

The technician dropped his 
eyes. “We can’t have new colon- 
ists getting pulled into those bur- 
rows, or impaled on those horns, 
sir.” He handed the report, trans- 
lated by the machine into read- 
able English, to Peters. The pilot 
scanned the sheets, and nodded. 

“Seems easy enough,” he said 
agreeably. “Those jellyfish-things, 
and the flying apes are similar 
to species encountered before. 
They’ll respond to simple gun- 
fire. Removal of the worm-things 
will be automatic, once their 
source of sustenance is des- 
troyed.” 

Jerry continued to sip his 
coffee and made no comment. 

“As for the lion-things,” 
Peters continued, “I doubt we’ll 



ARCTURUS TIMES THREE 



155 



have to attack them directly, 
since their digestive mechanism 
calls for sulphur from those pits. 
When we cap off the pits, or 
dry them up, to clear the air for 
the incoming colonial wave, that 
should starve them out within 
a week.” 

“Less than that,” Jerry re- 
marked emotionlessly. “Being 
hungry they’ll eat, regardless. 
Then, unable to go on to the 
next step in the process — the 
ingestion of the sulphur — 
they’ll die of food-poisoning. 
Simple, neat and efficient.” 
Peters smiled and gripped 
Jerry’s hand with his own. 

“We have you to thank for 
the information, sir,” he said, in 
obvious admiration. “At least we 
know we won’t have to fight the 
intelligent aliens. We’ll have the 
central regions; they’ll have the 
coasts and seas.” 

“And — ” Jerry pointedly with- 
drew his strong fingers from the 
pilot’s hand — “what happens 
when Mankind decides to spread 
out? When the colony grows 
awhile, it’s bound to want some 
of the coastal regions. Then 
what?” 

TEETERS looked uncomforta- 
ble, then said, “I don’t think 
that’s likely to happen, sir. Not 
for some time, at any rate.” 
“But it will happen,” said 
Jerry, somberly. “It always hap- 



pens. Earthmen meet new races, 
arbitrate a hit, sign pacts and 
move in. Then, when they’re 
settled pretty well, they ask the 
other race to move out. It’s 
almost a truism, Captain, that 
Earth can’t comprehend anyone 
but an Earthman having any 
rights to survival.” 

The tight-lipped technician ex- 
changed a look with Peters, then 
ducked back inside the ship. Ad- 
verse commentary about a Space 
Zoologist was dangerous. But no 
one had yet been broken in 
rank or discharged for a facial 
expression. 

“Well, sir, you’re entitled to 
your opinion, of course,” said 
Peters, wishing he had the moral 
courage to duck inside after the 
technician and avoid conversing 
with Norcriss. The job was done; 
why not forget it? 

Jerry, sensing the other man’s 
discomfort, dropped the topic, 
and contented himself with sit- 
ting there in the increasing dark- 
ness, sipping his coffee. After a 
minute or two, Peters gratefully 
mumbled his excuses and went 
into the ship. 

Jerry sighed, finished his cof- 
fee, then began to walk toward 
the edge of the clearing, to 
watch the stars glow more 
brightly than they could in the 
interference of the ship’s lights 
illuminating the camp. 

When he reached the rim of 



156 



GALAXY 



the wooded area, he stopped, 
then lay on his back in the cool 
grass and watched the night sky, 
his thoughts rueful ones and his 
inner amusement ironic. 

People always were puzzled 
about how a Space Zoologist 
could stand being a creature 
other than a human being. And 
Space Zoologists always were 
puzzled about how a human be- 
ing could stand being part of 
that conquering race called man. 

The twinkling stars distracted 
Jerry. Lying there watching 
them, he wondered to which of 
their planets he would be sent 



next, and to what dangers he 
might — in his new bodies — 
be subjected. 

Neither he nor any of his fel- 
low zoologists had any real ap- 
prehensions about death in an 
alien body. Fear of death, yes. 
That was normal enough, and 
inescapable in any creature. But 
he had no fear of perishing as a 
crawling thing, or multilegged 
thing, or soaring winged thing. 

To Jerry Norcriss — indeed, 
to any Space Zoologist — to die 
like a man was a dubious honor 
at best.

CLUSTER 







Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



W HEN the eviction order 
arrived, Fats Jordan was 
hanging in the center of 
the Big Glass Balloon, hugging his 
guitar to his massive black belly 
above his purple shorts. 

The Big Igloo, as the large liv- 
ing-Globe was more often called, 
was not really made of glass. It 
was sealingsilk, a cheap flexible 
material almost as transparent as 
fused silica and ten thousand 



158 



GALAXY 



times tougher — quite tough 
enough to hold a breathable pres- 
sure of air in the hard vacuum of 
space. 

Beyond the spherical wall 
loomed the other and somewhat 
smaller balloons of the Beat Clus- 
ter, connected to each other and 
to the Big Igloo by three-foot- 
diameter cylindrical tunnels of 
triple-strength tinted sealingsilk. 
In them floated or swam about an 
assemblage of persons of both 
sexes in informal dress and un- 
dress and engaged in activities 
suitable to freefall: sleeping, sun- 
bathing, algae tending (“rocking” 
spongy cradles of water, fertilizer 
and the green scummy “guk”), 
yeast culture (a rather similar 
business), reading, studying, argu- 
ing, stargazing, meditation, space- 
squash (played inside the globu- 
lar court of a stripped balloon), 
dancing, artistic creation in nu- 
merous media and the production 
of sweet sound (few musical in- 
struments except the piano de- 
pend in any way on gravity). 

Attached to the Beat Cluster 
by two somewhat larger sealing- 
silk tunnels and blocking off a 
good eighth of the inky, star- 
speckled sky, was the vast trim 
aluminum bulk of Research Satel- 
lite One, dazzling now in the un- 
tempered sunlight. 

It was mostly this sunlight re- 
flected by the parent satellite, 
however, that now illuminated 



Fats Jordan and the other 
“floaters” of the Beat Cluster. A 
huge sun-quilt was untidily 
spread (staying approximately 
where it was put, like all objects 
in freefall) against most of the in- 
side pf the Big Igloo away from 
the satellite. The sun-quilt was a 
patchwork of colors and materials 
on the inward side, but silvered 
on the outward side, as turned- 
over edges and corners showed. 
Similar “Hollywood Blankets” 
protected the other igloos from 
the undesirable heating effects of 
too much sunlight and, of course, 
blocked off the sun’s disk from 
view. 

Fats, acting as Big Daddy of 
the Space Beats, received the 
eviction order with thoughtful 
sadness. 

“So we all of us gotta go down 
there?” 

TTE jerked a thumb at the 
Earth, which looked about as 
big as a basketball held at arms- 
length, poised midway between 
the different silvers of the sun- 
quilt margin and the satellite. 
Dirty old Terra was in half phase: 
wavery blues and browns toward 
the sun, black away from it ex- 
cept for the tiny nebulous glows 
of a few big cities. 

“That is correct,” the proctor 
of the new Resident Civilian Ad- 
ministrator replied through thin 
lips. The new proctor was a lean 



THE BEAT CLUSTER 



159 



man in silvery gray blouse, Ber- 
muda shorts and sockassins. His 
hair was precision clipped — a 
quarter-inch blond lawn. He 
looked almost unbearably neat 
and hygienic contrasted with the 
sloppy long-haired floaters around 
him. He almost added, “and high 
time, too,” but he remembered 
that the Administrator had en- 
joined him to be tactful — “firm, 
but tactful.” He did not take this 
suggestion as including his nose, 
which had been wrinkled ever 
since he had entered the igloos. 
It was all he could do not to hold 
it shut with his fingers. Between 
the overcrowding and the loath- 
some Chinese gardening, the Beat 
Cluster stank. 

And it was dirty. Even the 
satellite’s precipitrons, working 
over the air withdrawn from the 
Beat Cluster via the exhaust tun- 
nel, couldn’t keep pace with the 
new dust. Here and there a film of 
dirt on the sealingsilk blurred the 
starfields. And once the proctor 
thought he saw the film crawl. 

Furthermore, at the moment 
Fats Jordan was upside-down to 
the proctor, which added to the 
latter’s sense of the unfitness of 
things. Really, he thought, these 
beat types were the curse of space. 
The sooner they were out of it 
the better. 

“Man,” Fats said mournfully, 
“I never thought they were going 
to enforce those old orders.” 



“The new Administrator has 
made it his first official act,” the 
proctor said, smiling leanly. He 
went on, “The supply rocket was 
due to make the down-jump 
empty this morning, but the Ad- 
ministrator is holding it. There is 
room for fifty of your people. We 
will expect that first contingent at 
the boarding tube an hour before 
nightfall.” 

Fats shook his head mournfully 
and said, “Gonna be a pang, 
leavin’ space.” 

His remark was taken up and 
echoed by various individuals 
spotted about in the Big Igloo. 

66T T’S going to be a dark time,” 
said Knave Grayson, mer- 
chant spaceman and sun-wor- 
shipper. Red beard and sheath- 
knife at his belt made him look 
like a pirate. “Do you realize the 
nights average twelve hours down 
there instead of two? And there 
are days when you never see Sol?” 

“Gravity yoga will be a trial 
after freefall yoga,” Guru Ishping- 
ham opined, shifting from pad- 
masana to a position that put his 
knees behind his ears 1 in a fashion 
that made the proctor look away. 
The tall, though presently much 
folded and intertwined, Briton 
was as thin as Fats Jordan was 
stout. (In space the number of 
thins and fats tends to increase 
sharply, as neither overweight nor 
under-musculature carries the 



160 



GALAXY 



penalties it does on the surface of 
a planet.) 

“And mobiles will be trivial 
after space stabiles,” Erica Janes 
threw under her shoulder. The 
husky sculptress had just put the 
finishing touches to one of her 
three-dimensional free montages 
— an arrangement of gold, blue 
and red balls — and was snapping 
a stereophoto of it. “What really 
hurts,” she added, “is that our 
kids will have to try to compre- 
hend Newton’s Three Laws of 
Motion in an environment limit- 
ed by a gravity field. Elementary 
physics should never be taught 
anywhere except in freefall.” 

“No more space diving, no more 
water sculpture, no more vacuum 
chemistry,” chanted the Brain, 
fourteen-year-old fugitive from a 
brilliant but much broken home 
down below. 

“No more space pong, no more 
space pool,” chimed in the 
Brainess, his sister. (Space pool, 
and likewise billiards, is played 
on the inner surface of a stripped 
balloon. The balls, when properly 
cued, follow it by reason of their 
slight centrifugal force.) 

“Ah well, we all knew this bub- 
ble would someday burst,” Gussy 
Friml summed up, pinwheeling 
lazily in her black leotards. 
(There is something particularly 
beautiful about girls in space, 
where gravity doesn’t tug at their 
curves. Even fat folk don’t sag in 



freefall. Luscious curves become 
truly remarkable.) 

“Yes!” Knave Grayson agreed 
savagely. He’d seemed lost in 
brooding since his first remarks. 
Now as if he’d abruptly reached 
conclusions, he whipped out his 
knife and drove it through the 
taut sealingsilk at his elbow. 

The proctor knew he shouldn’t 
have winced so convulsively. 
There was only the briefest whis- 
tle of escaping air before the edge- 
tension in the sealingsilk closed 
the hole with an audible snap. 

TZ"NAVE smiled wickedly at the 
^“-proctor. “Just testing,” he ex- 
plained. “I knew a roustabout who 
lost a foot stepping through seal- 
ingsilk. Edge-tension cut it off 
clean at the ankle. The foot’s still 
orbiting around the satellite, in a 
brown boot with needle-sharp 
hobnails. This is one spot where 
a boy’s got to remember not to 
put his finger in the dike.” 

At that moment Fats Jordan, 
who’d seemed lost in brooding 
too, struck a chilling but authori- 
tative chord on his guitar. 

“Gonna be a pang 

“Leavin’ space,” (he sang) 

“Gonna be a pang!” 

The proctor couldn’t help winc- 
ing again. “That’s all very well,” 
he said sharply, “and I’m glad 
you’re taking this realistically. 



THE BEAT CLUSTER 



161 



But hadn’t you better be getting 
a move on?” 

Fats Jordan paused with his 
hand above the strings. “How do 
you mean, Mister Proctor?” he 
asked. 

“I mean getting your first fifty 
ready for the down jump!” 

“Oh, that,” Fats said and 
paused reflectively. “Well, now, 
Mr. Proctor, thafs going to take 
a little time.” 

The proctor snorted. “Two 
hours!” he said sharply and, grab- 
bing at the nylon line he’d had 
the foresight to trail into the Beat 
Cluster behind him (rather like 
Theseus venturing into the Mino- 
taur’s probably equally smelly 
labyrinth), he swiftly made his 
way out of the Big Igloo, hand 
over hand, by way of the green 
tunnel. 

The Brainess giggled. Fats 
frowned at her solemnly. The gig- 
gling was cut off. To cover her 
embarrassment the Brainess be- 
gan to hum the tune to one of 
her semi-private songs: 

“Eskimos of space are we 

“In our igloos falling free. 

“We are space’s Esquimaux, 

“Fearless vacuum-chewing 
hawks.” 

Fats tossed Gussy his guitar, 
which set him spinning very slow- 
ly. As he rotated, precessing a 
little, he ticked off points to his 



comrades on his stubby, ripe- 
banana-clustered fingers. 

“Somebody gonna have to tell 
the research boys we’re callin’ off 
the art show an’ the ballet an’ ter- 
minatin’ jazz Fridays. Likewise 
the Great Books course an’ Satur- 
day poker. Might as well inform 
our friends of Edison and Con- 
vair at the same time that they’re 
gonna have to hold the 3D chess 
and 3D go tournaments at their 
place, unless they can get the 
new Administrator to donate 
them our quarters when we leave 
— which I doubt. I imagine he’ll 
tote the Cluster off a ways and 
use the igloos for target practice. 
With the self-sealin’ they should 
hold shape a long time. 

“But don’t exactly tell the re- 
search boys when we’re goin’ or 
why. Play it mysterioso. 

“Meanwhile the gals gotta start 
sewin’ us some ground clothes. 
Warm and decent. And we all 
gotta get our papers ready for 
the customs men, though I’m 
afraid most of us ain’t kept nothin’ 
but Davis passports. Heck, some 
of you are probably here on Nan- 
sen passports. 

“An’ we better pool our credits 
to buy wheelchairs and dollies 
groundside for such of us as are 
gonna need ’em.” Fats looked 
back and forth dolefully from 
Guru Ishpingham’s interwoven 
emaciation to his own hyper-port- 
liness. 



162 



GALAXY 



1%/IEANWHILE a space-diver 
had approached the Big Ig- 
loo from the direction of the satel- 
lite, entered the folds of a limp 
blister, zipped it shut behind him 
and unzipped the slit leading in- 
side. The blister filled with a dull 
pop and the diver pushed inside 
through the lips. With a sharp 
effort he zipped them shut be- 
hind him, then threw back his 
helmet. 

“Condition Red!” he cried. “The 
new Administrator’s planning to 
ship us all groundside! I got it 
straight from the Police Chief. 
The new A’s taking those old de- 
portation orders seriously and 
he’s holding the — ” 

“We know all about that, Trace 
Davis,” Fats interrupted him. 
“The new A’s proctor’s been 
here.” 

“Well, what are you going to 
do about it?” the other demanded. 

“Nothin’,” Fats serenely in- 
formed the flushed and shock- 
headed diver. “We’re comply in’. 
You, Trace — ” he pointed a finger 
— “get out of that suit. We’re 
auctionin’ it off ’long with all the 
rest of our unworldly goods. The 
research boys’ll be eager to bid 
on it. For fun-diving our space- 
suits are the pinnacle.” 

A carrot-topped head thrust 
out of the blue tunnel. “Hey, Fats, 
we’re broadcasting,” its freckled 
owner called accusingly. “You’re 
on in thirty seconds!” 



“Baby, I clean forgot,” Fats 
said. He sighed and shrugged. 
“Guess I gotta tell our downside 
fans the inglorious news. Remem- 
ber all my special instructions, 
chillun. Share ’em out among 
you.” He grabbed Gussy Friml’s 
black ankle as it swung past him 
and shoved off on it, coasting 
toward the blue tunnel at about 
one fifth the velocity with which 
Gussy receded from him in the 
opposite direction. 

“Hey, Fats,” Gussy called to 
him as she bounced gently off the 
sun-quilt, “you got any general 
message for us?” 

“Yeah,” Fats replied, still ro- 
tating as he coasted and smiling 
as he rotated. “Make more guk, 
chillun. Yeah,” he repeated as he 
disappeared into the blue tunnel, 
“take off the growth checks an’ 
make mo’ guk.” 

CEVEN seconds later he was 
^ floating beside the spherical 
mike of the Beat Cluster’s short- 
wave station. The bright instru- 
ments and heads of the Small 
Jazz Ensemble were all clustered 
in, sounding a last chord, while 
their foreshortened feet waved 
around the periphery. The half 
dozen of them, counting Fats, 
were like friendly fish nosing up 
to the single black olive of the 
mike. Fats had his eyes on the 
Earth, a little more than half 
night now and about as big as 



THE BEAT CLUSTER

the snare drum standing out from 
the percussion rack Jordy had his 
legs scissored around. It was good, 
Fats thought, to see who you 
were talking to. 

“Greetings, groundsiders,” he 
said softly when the last echo 
had come back from the sealing- 
silk and died in the sun-quilt. 
“This is that ever-hateful voice 
from outer space, the voice of 
your old tormentor Fats Jordan, 
advertising no pickle juice.” Fats 
actually said “advertising,” not 
“advertisin’ ” — his diction always 
improved when he was on 
vacuum. 

“And for a change, folks, I’m 
going to take this space to tell 
you something about us. No jokes 
this time, just tedious talk. I got 
a reason, a real serious reason, 
but I ain’t saying what it is for 
a minute.” 

He continued, “You look 
mighty cozy down there, mighty 
cozy from where we’re floating. 
Because we’re way out here, you 
know. Out of this world, to quote 
the man. A good twenty thousand 
miles out, Captain Nemo. 

“Or we’re up here, if it sounds 
better to you that way. Way over 
your head. Up here with the stars 
and the flaming sun and the hot- 
cold vacuum, orbiting around 
Earth in our crazy balloons that 
look like a cluster of dingy glass 
grapes.” 

The band had begun to blow 



softly again, weaving a cool back- 
ground to Fat’s lazy phrases. 

“Yes, the boys and girls are in 
space now, groundsiders. We’ve 
found the cheap way here, the 
back door. The wild ones who 
yesterday Would have headed for 
the Village or the Quarter or Big 
Sur, the Left Bank or North 
Beach, or just packed up their 
Zen Buddhism and hit the road, 
are out here now, digging cool 
sounds as they fall round and 
round Dear Old Dirty. And folks, 
ain’t you just a little glad we’re 
gone?” 

^T^HE band coasted into a phrase 
that was like the lazy swing 
of a hammock. 

“Our cold-water flats have 
climbed. Our lofts have gone aloft. 
We’ve cut our pads loose from 
the cities and floated them above 
the stratosphere. It was a stiff drag 
for our motorcycles, Dad, but we 
made it. And ain’t you a mite 
delighted to be rid of us? I know 
we’re not all up here. But the 
worst of us are. 

“You know, people once pic- 
tured the conquest of space en- 
tirely in terms of military out- 
posts and machine precision.” 
Here Burr’s trumpet blew a 
crooked little battle cry. “They 
didn’t leave any room in their 
pictures for the drifters and 
dreamers, the rebels and no-goods 
(like me, folks!) who are up here

right now, orbiting with ^ few < 
pounds of oxygen and"'aT couple 
of gobs of guk (and a few cock- 
roaches, sure, and maybe even a 
few mice, though we keep a cat) 
inside a cluster of smelly old bal- 
loons. 

“That’s a laugh in itself: the 
antique vehicle that first took 
man off the ground also being the 
first to give him cheap living 
quarters outside the atmosphere. 
Primitive balloons floated free in 
the grip of the wind; we fall free 
in the clutch of gravity. A bal- 
loon’s a symbol, you know, folks. 

A symbol of dreams and hopes 
and easily-punctured illusions. Be- 
cause a balloon’s a kind of bubble. 
But bubbles can be tough.” 

Led by Jordy’s drums, the band 
worked into the Blue Ox theme 
from the Paul Bunyan Suite. 

“Tough the same way the hem- 
lock tents and sod huts of the 
American settlers were tough. We 
got out into space, a lot of us did, 
the same way the Irish and Finns 
got west. They built the long rail- 
roads. We built the big satellites.” 

Here the band shifted to the 
Axe theme; 

“I was a welder myself. I came 
into space with a bunch of other 
galoots to help stitch together Re- 
search Satellite One. I didn’t like 
the barracks they put us in, so I. 
made myself a little private home ; 
f sealingsilk, a material whic^l 
was used only for storing] 




G A.IAX 



liquids and gases — nobody’d even 
thought of it for human habita- 
tion. I started to meditate there 
in my bubble and I came to grips 
with a few half-ultimates and I 
got to like it real well in space. 
Same thing happened to a few of 
the other galoots. You know, folks, 
a guy who’s wacky enough to 
wrestle sheet aluminum in vac- 
uum in a spider suit may very 
well be wacky enough to get to 
really like stars and weightless- 
ness and all the rest of it. 

“When the construction job was 
done and the big research outfits 
moved in, we balloon men stayed 
on. It took some wangling but we 
managed. We weren’t costing the 
Government much. And it was 
mighty convenient for them to 
have us around for odd jobs. 

I ^HAT was the nucleus of our 
squatter cluster. The space 
roustabouts and roughnecks came 
first. The artists and oddballs, who 
have a different kind of toughness, 
followed. They got wind of what 
our life was like and they bought, 
bummed or conned their way up 
here. Some got space research 
jobs and shifted over to us at the 
ends of their stints. Others came 
up on awards trips and managed 
to get lost from their parties and 
accidentally find us. They brought 
their tapes and instruments with 
them, their sketchbooks and typ- 
ers; some even smuggled up their 



own balloons. Most of them 
learned to do some sort of space 
work — it’s good insurance on 
staying aloft. But don’t get me 
wrong. We’re none of us work- 
crazy. Actually we’re the laziest 
cats in the cosmos: the ones who 
couldn’t bear the thought of carry- 
ing their own weight around 
every day of their lives! We most- 
ly only toil when we have to have 
money for extras or when there’s 
a job that’s just got to be done. 
We’re the dreamers and funsters, 
the singers and studiers. We 
leave the ‘to the stars by hard 
ways’ business to our friends the 
space marines. When we use the 
‘ad astra per aspera’ motto (was 
it your high school’s too?) we 
change the last word to asparagus 
— maybe partly to honor the 
green guk we grow to get us oxy- 
gen (so we won’t be chiseling too 
much gas from the Government) 
and to commemorate the food- 
yeasts and the other stuff we 
grow from our garbage. 

“What sort of life do we have 
up here? How can we stand it 
cooped up in a lot of stinking 
balloons? Man, we’re free out 
here, really free for the first time. 
We’re floating, literally. Gravity 
can’t bow our backs or break our 
arches or tame our ideas. You 
know, it’s only out here that stu- 
pid people like us can really 
think. The weightlessness gets our 
thoughts and we can sort them. 



THE BEAT CLUSTER 



167 



Ideas grow out here like nowhere 
else — it’s the right environment 
for them. 

“Anybody can get into space if 
he wants to hard enough. The 
ticket is a dream. 

“That’s our story, folks. We 
took the space road because it 
was the only frontier left. We had 
to come out, just because space 
was here, like the man who 
climbed the mountain, like the 
first man who skin-dove into the 
green deeps. Like the first man 
who envied a bird or a shooting 
star.” 

The music had softly soared 
with Fat’s words. Now it died with 
them and when he spoke again it 
was without accompaniment, just 
a flat lonely voice. 

“But that isn’t quite the end 
of the story, folks. I told you I 
had something serious to impart 
— serious to us anyway. It looks 
like we’re not going to be able 
to stay in space, folks. We’ve been 
told to get out. Because we’re the 
wrong sort of people. Because we 
don’t have the legal right to stay 
here, only the right that’s con- 
veyed by a dream. 

“Maybe there’s real justice in 
it. Maybe we’ve sat too long in 
the starbird seat. Maybe the beat 
generation doesn’t belong in 
space. Maybe space belongs to 
soldiers and the civil service, with 
a slice of it for the research boys. 
Maybe there’s somebody who 



wants to be in space more than 
we do. Maybe we deserve our 
comedownance. I wouldn’t know. 

“So get ready for a jolt, folks. 
We’re coming back! If you don't 
want to see us, or if you think 
we ought to be kept safely 
cooped up here for any reason, 
you just might let the President 
know. 

“This is the Beat Cluster, folks, 
signing off.” 

A S FATS and the band pushed 
away from each other, Fats 
saw that the little local audience 
in the sending balloon had grown 
and that not all new arrivals were 
fellow floaters. 

“Fats, what’s this nonsense 
about you people privatizing your 
activities and excluding research 
personnel?” a grizzle-haired 
stringbean demanded. “You can’t 
cut off recreation that way. I de- 
pend on the Cluster to keep my 
electron bugs happily abnormal. 
We even mention it downside 
in recruiting personnel — though 
we don’t put it in print.” 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Thoms,” Fats 
said. “No offense meant to you 
or to General Electric. But I got 
no time to explain. Ask somebody 
else.” 

“Whatdya mean, no offense?” 
the other demanded, grabbing at 
the purple shorts. “What are you 
trying to do, segregate the 
squares in space? What’s wrong 



168 



GALAXY 



with research? Aren’t we good 
enough for you?” 

“Yes,” put in Rumpleman of 
Convair, “and while you’re doing 
that would you kindly throw 
some light on this directive we 
just received from the new A — 
that the Cluster’s off-bounds to us 
and that all dating between re- 
search personnel and Cluster 
girls must stop? Did you put the 
new A up to that, Fats?” 

“Not exactly,” Fats said. “Look, 
boys, let up on me. I got work to 
do.” 

“Work!” Rumpleman snorted. 

“Don’t think you’re going to 
get away with it,” Thoms warned 
Fats. “We’re going to protest. 
Why, the Old Man is frantic about 
the 3D chess tournament. He 
says the Brain’s the only real 
competition he has up here.” 
(The Old Man was Hubert Wil- 
lis, guiding genius of the open 
bevatron on the other side of the 
satellite.) 

“The other research outfits are 
kicking up a fuss too,” Trace 
Davis put in. “We spread the 
news like you said, and they say 
we can’t walk out on them this 
way.” 

“Allied Microbiotics,” Gussy 
Friml said, “wants to know who’s 
going to take over the experi- 
ments on unshielded guk societies 
in freefall that we’ve been run- 
ning for them in the Cluster.” 

Two of the newcomers had 



slightly more confidential mes- 
sages for Fats. 

Allison of Convair said, “I 
wouldn’t tell you, except I think 
you’ve guessed, that I’ve been 
using the Beat Cluster as a pilot 
study in the psychology of an- 
archic human societies in freefall. 
If you cut yourself off from us, 
I’m in a hole.” 

“It’s mighty friendly of you 
to feel that way,” Fats said, “but 
right now I got to rush.” 

OPACE Marines Sergeant Gom- 
^ bert, satellite police chief, 
drew Fats aside and said, “I don’t 
know why you’re giving research 
a false impression of what’s hap- 
pening, but they’ll find out the 
truth soon enough and I suppose 
you have your own sweet insidi- 
ous reasons. Meanwhile I’m here 
to tell you that I can’t spare the 
men to police your exodus. As 
you know, you old corner-cutter, 
this place is run more like a na- 
tional park than a military post, 
in spite of its theoretical high se- 
curity status. I’m going to have to 
ask you to handle the show your- 
self, using your best judgment.” 

“We’ll certainly work hard at 
it, Chief,” Fats said. “Hey, every- 
body, get cracking!” 

“Understand,” Gombert con- 
tinued, his expression very fierce, 
“I’m wholly on the side of official- 
dom. I’ll be officially overjoyed 
to see the last of you floaters. It 



THE BEAT CLUSTER 



169 



just so happens that at the mo- 
ment I’m short-handed.” 

“I understand,” Fats said soft- 
ly, then bellowed, “On the jump, 
everybody!” 

But at sunset the new A’s proc- 
tor was again facing him, right- 
side-up this time, in the Big Igloo. 

“Your first fifty were due at the 
boarding tube an hour ago,” the 
proctor began ominously. 

“That’s right,” Fats assured 
him. “It just turns out we’re going 
to need a little more time.” 
“What’s holding you up?” 
“We’re getting ready, Mr. 
Proctor,” Fats said. “See how 
busy everybody is?” 

A half dozen figures were 
rhythmically diving around the 
Big Igloo, folding the sun-quilt. 
The sun’s disk had dipped be- 
hind the Earth and only its wild 
corona showed, pale hair stream- 
ing across the star-fields. The 
Earth had gone into its dark 
phase, except for the faint un- 
balanced halo of sunlight bent by 
the atmosphere and for the faint 
dot-dot-dot of glows that were 
the Los Angeles-Chicago-New 
York line. Soft yellow lights 
sprang up here and there in the 
Cluster as it prepared for its 
short night. The transparent bal- 
loons seemed to vanish, leaving 
a band of people camped among 
the stars. 

The proctor said, “We know 
you’ve been getting some unof- 



ficial sympathy from research 
and even the MPs. Don’t depend 
on it. The new Administrator can 
create special deputies to enforce 
the deportation orders.” 

“He certainly can,” Fats agreed 
earnestly, “but he don’t need to. 
We’re going ahead with it all, Mr. 
Proctor, as fast as we’re able. 
F’rinstance, our groundclothes 
ain’t sewed yet. You wouldn’t 
want us arriving downside half 
naked an’ givin’ the sat’ a bad 
reputation. So just let us work an’ 
don’t joggle our elbow.” 

The proctor snorted. He said, 
“Let’s not waste each other’s 
time. You know, if you force us 
to do it, we can cut off your 
oxygen.” 

r I TIERE was a moment’s si- 
■*- lence. Then from the side 
Trace Davis said loudly, “Listen 
to that! Listen to a man who’d 
solve the groundside housing 
problem by cutting off the water 
to the slums.” 

But Fats frowned at Trace and 
said quietly only, “If Mr. Proctor 
shut down on our air, he’d only 
be doing the satellite a disservice. 
Right now our algae are produc- 
ing a shade more oxy than we 
burn. We’ve upped the guk pro- 
duction. If you don’t believe me, 
Mr. Proctor, you can ask the 
atmosphere boys to check.” 

“Even if you do have enough 
oxygen,” the proctor retorted, 



170 



GALAXY 



“you need our forced ventilation 
to keep your air moving. Lacking 
gravity convection, you’d suffo- 
cate in your own exhaled breath.” 
“We got our fans ready, battery 
driven,” Fats told him. 

“You’ve got no place to mount 
them, no rigid framework,” the 
proctor objected. 

“They’ll mount on harnesses 
near each tunnel mouth,” Fats 
said imperturbably. “Without 
gravity they’ll climb away from 
the tunnel mouths and ride the 
taut harness. Besides, we’re not 
above hand labor if it’s necessary. 
We could use punkahs.” 

“Air’s not the only problem,” 
the proctor interjected. “We can 
cut off your food. You’ve been 
living on handouts.” 

“Right now,” Fats said softly, 
“we’re living half on yeasts grown 
from our own personal garbage. 
Living well, as you can see by a 
look at me. And if necessary we 
can do as much better than half 
as we have to. We’re farmers, 
man.” 

“We can seal off the Cluster,” 
the proctor snapped back, “and 
set you adrift. The orders allow 
it.” 

Fats replied, “Why not? It 
would make a very interesting 
day-to-day drama for the ground- 
side public and for the food 
chemists — seeing just how long 
we can maintain a flourishing 
ecology.” 



The proctor grabbed at his 
nylon line. “I’m going to report 
your attitude to the new Admin- 
istrator as hostile,” he sputtered. 
“You’ll hear from us again short- 
ly.” 

“Give him our greetings when 
you do,” Fats said. “We haven’t 
had opportunity to offer them. 
And there’s one other thing,” he 
called after the proctor, “I notice 
you hold your nose mighty rigid 
in here. It’s a waste of energy. 
If you’d just steel yourself and 
take three deep breaths you’d 
never notice our stink again.” 

r ¥' , HE proctor bumped into the 
tunnel side in his haste to 
be gone. Nobody laughed, which 
doubled the embarrassment. If 
they’d have laughed he could 
have cursed. Now he had to bot- 
tle up his indignation until he 
could discharge it in his report 
to the new Administrator. 

But even this outlet was denied 
him. 

“Don’t tell me a word,” the 
new Administrator snapped at his 
proctor as the latter zipped into 
the aluminum office. “The depor- 
tation is canceled. I’ll tell you 
about it, but if you tell anybody 
else I’ll down- jump you. In the 
last twenty minutes I’ve had mes- 
sages direct from the Space Mar- 
shal and the President We must 
not disturb the Beat Cluster be- 
cause of public opinion and

because, although they don’t 
know it, they’re a pilot experi- 
ment in the free migration of 
people into space.” (“Where else, 
Joel,” the President had said, “do 
you think we’re going to get 
people to go willingly off the 
Earth and achieve a balanced ex- 
istence, using their own waste 
products? Besides, they’re a float- 
ing labor pool for the satellites. 
And Joel, do you realize Jordan’s 
broadcast is getting as much at- 
tention as the Russian landings 
on Ganymede?”) The new Ad- 
ministrator groaned softly and 
asked the Unseen, “Why don’t 
they tell a new man these things 
before he makes a fool of him- 
self?” 

Back in the Beat Cluster, Fats 
struck the last chord of “Glow 
Little Glow Worm.” Slowly the 
full moon rose over the satellite, 



dimming the soft yellow lights 
that seemed to float in free space. 
The immemorial white globe of 
Luna was a little bit bigger than 
when viewed from Earth and its 
surface markings were more 
sharply etched. The craters of 
Tycho and Copernicus stood out 
by reason of the bright ray sys- 
tems shooting out from them and 
the little dark smudge of the 
Mare Crisium looked like a 
curled black kitten. Fats led 
those around him into a new 
song: 

“Gonna be a pang 
“Leavin’ space, 

“Gonna be a pang! 

“Gonna be a pang 
“Leavin’ space, 

“So we won’t go!”

The big news for December is Poul Anderson, beginning a major

The Day After Doomsday. It's Anderson's latest, and not far from being 
his best ever — which, as every science-fiction reader well knows, is very 
good indeed. 

But there's more. Three fine novelettes, including Algis Budrys with 
Wall of Crystal, Eye of Night and Margaret St. Clair with a classification- 
defying exercise in wit and whimsy. An Old Fashioned Bird Christmas. Plus 
Willy Ley . plus the usual lineup of shorts . plus (we hope; if the type

THE ASTRONAUTS by Martin 
Caidin. E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc. 

The limited payloads of our 
rockets have necessitated the 
Mercury Project approach to our 
first spaceflight. Despite safe- 
guards and fail-safe devices, our 
attempts are marginal. 

Caidin’s copiously illustrated 
book fills in the information gap 



about America’s seven astronauts, 
the men who hold the key to our 
chances. They are so remarkably 
able that the results of the tests 
awed the medical and technical 
testers. “Some of them actually 
kept up with (the tests) and they 
aren’t designed to be kept up 
with!”

NINETY SECONDS TO SPACE 
by Jules Bergman. Hanover 
House. 

The book, an extravagantly il- 
lustrated account of the X-15 and 
its predecessors, refers in title to 
the total powered flight time of 
the rocket craft. It is also the 
story of the men who fly in (and 
occasionally die in) these barrier- 
shattering flying laboratories. As 
an inspirational story of hard 
work, research, experimentation 
and pure bravery, this book is 
tough to beat. 

COUNTDOWN by William Roy 
Shelton. Little, Brown & Co. 

“The story of Cape Canaveral,” 
reads the subtitle of this book 
which chronicles the growth of 
America’s prime rocket-launch 
area from a snake’s paradise to 



the most exciting piece of real- 
estate in the western hemisphere. 
It is also the life story of many

all of the shoots, has written a 
breezy, interest-sustaining story. 

THE MAN WHO RODE THE 
THUNDER by W. H. Rankin. 
Prentice Hall, Inc. 

Marine Lt. Col. Rankin made 
headlines when he bailed out of 
a supersonic jet ten miles up with- 
out a pressure suit and then de- 
scended through a thunderstorm. 
The return to earth took forty 
minutes instead of ten, but a frail 
human being survived the unbe- 
lievable violence of the thunder, 
lightning and deluge. 

This thrilling true adventure 
makes one speculate upon what 
extremes of physical anguish the 
new breed of spacemen will have 
to endure.

is — but it only took the Navy

was a shrewd decision to switch

serve as inspiration to all good 
damn-the-red-taper-ers. 

THE FASCINATING WORLD 
OF ASTRONOMY by R. S. 
Richardson. McGraw Hill Book 
Co., Inc. 

Dr. Richardson, formerly of 
Palomar and Mt. Wilson, employ- 
ing the question-and-answer tech- 
nique, poses questions that lay- 
men ask most: 

“What makes the sun shine?” 

“What created the planets?” 

“What is the farthest the eye

The good doctor has written an 
eminently readable and informa- 
tive book. 

THE BOOK OF THE ATOM by

Author de Vries’s bated-breath

“The Greatest Race of All Time;” 
“Leviathan in Chains;” “A Crack-

CAREERS AND OPPORTUNI-

The stupendous strides of tech-

revision of a 1945 career guide. 
Industries and products undreamt 
of 15 years ago have opened up 
job opportunities equally new. 
Pollack’s fine book details oppor-

THE ROMANCE OF WEIGHTS 
AND MEASURES by Keith Gor- 
don Irwin. The Viking Press. 

Irwin’s special interest is the 
English system; its origins, 
changes and present complexity. 
He presents the beautiful simplic- 
ity of decimal-system measure- 
ment in Anglo-Saxon England a 
millenium ago and the succeeding 
chaos created by Norman con- 
quest and foreign trade. 

In his fascinating book, Irwin, 
like Asimov, proves that the sub- 
ject of weights and measures can 
be as engrossing as any facet of 
human development. 

THE LIFE AND TIMES OF 
TARQUIN THE ETRUSCAN by 
C. M. Franzero. The John Day 
Co., Inc. 

That the Etruscans are a 
people of mystery is peculiar be- 
cause Etruria, even more than 
Greece, is the cornerstone of 
Roman civilization. Rome took 



over intact the Etruscan system 
of government, army organiza- 
tion, civil engineering. The found- 
er of the Tarquinian dynasty of 
Roman kings was Etruscan. 

However, the infamous “Rape 
of Lucrece” touched off the de- 
struction, in repugnance, by the 
Romans of every available Etrus- 
can relic. 

Franzero’s minutely detailed 
book makes the utmost of myth 
and conjecture. 

THE LOST PHARAOHS by 
Leonard Cottrell. Holt, Rine- 
hart and Winston. 

Archeology being scientific de- 
tection raised to the heights, it is 
hardly surprising that Cottrell’s 
exciting book reads like a detec- 
tive story. Instead of tracking 
down culprits, however, Egyptolo- 
gists uncover cadavers buried for 
millenia. In one fantastic dis- 
covery, over thirty Pharaohs were 
found in a common tomb where 
they had been hastily reburied 
more than 3000 years ago to save 
them from the ravages of tomb 
robbers!

SCIENCE PUZZLERS by Mar-

First impression is that Gard-

of stunts. However, each puzzler 
is just that; it makes the reader 
ponder even though no special 
experimental equipment is 
needed. 

Chemistry, astronomy, topol-

tors to the mind-teasers. 



THE WILD ROCKET by Peggy 
Hoffman. Westminster Press. 

An indisputably fit subject for 
a science-fiction juvenile is the 
planning, building and firing of a 
home-made, six-foot, solid-propel- 
lant rocket by an untutored back- 
woods boy. These basic facts are 
mere background however, for 
Mrs. Hoffman’s warm, tender 
story of the guts and sheer deter- 
mination of the orphaned, love- 
less youth and the understanding 
he encounters.

He was dangerously insane. 

He threatened to destroy 
everything that was noble and 
decent — including my date 
with my girl! 



By DONALD E. WESTLAKE 
Illustrated by WEST 

W HEN the elevator didn’t 
come, that just made 
the day perfect. A 
broken egg yolk, a stuck zipper, 
a feedback in the aircon exhaust, 
the window sticking at full trans- 
parency — well, I won’t go 
through the whole sorry list. Suf- 
fice it to say that when the ele- 
vator didn’t come, that put the 
roof on the city, as they say. 

It was just one of those days. 
Everybody gets them. Days when 
you’re lucky in you make it to 
nightfall with no bones broken. 

But of all times for it to hap- 
pen! For literally months I’d been 
building my courage up. And 
finally, just today, I had made up 
my mind to do it — to propose to 
Linda. I’d called her second thing 
this morning — right after the 
egg yolk — and invited myself 
down to her place. “Ten o’clock,” 
she’d said, smiling sweetly at me 
out of the phone. She knew why 
I wanted to talk to her. And 




178 



GALAXY 



when Linda said ten o’clock, she 
meant ten o’clock. 

Don’t get me wrong. I don’t 
mean that Linda’s a perfectionist 
or a harridan or anything like 
that. Far from it. But she does 
have a fixation on that one sub- 
ject of punctuality. The result of 
her job, of course. She was an ore- 
sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being 
robots, were invariably punctual. 
If an ore-sled didn’t return on 
time, no one waited for it. They 
simply knew that it had been 
captured by some other Project 
and had blown itself up. 

Well, of course, after working 
as an ore-sled dispatcher for three 
years, Linda quite naturally was a 
bit obsessed. I remember one 
time, shortly after we’d started 
dating, when I arrived at her 
place five minutes late and found 
her having hysterics. She thought 
I’d been killed. She couldn’t 
visualize anything less than that 
keeping me from arriving at the 
designated moment. When I told 
her what actually had happened 
— I’d broken a shoe lace — she 
refused to speak to me for four 
days. 

And then the elevator didn’t 
come. 

¥ TNTIL then, I’d managed 
^ somehow to keep the day’s 
minor disasters from ruining my 
mood. Even while eating that hor- 
rible egg — I couldn’t very well 



throw it away, broken yolk or 
no; it was my breakfast allotment 
and I was hungry — and while 
hurriedly jury-rigging drapery 
across that gaspingly transparent 
window — one hundred and fifty- 
three stories straight down to slag 
— I kept going over and over my 
prepared proposal speeches, try- 
ing to select the most effective 
one. 

I had a Whimsical Approach: 
“Honey, I see there’s a nice little 
Non-P apartment available up on 
one seventy-three.” And I had a 
Romantic Approach: “Darling, I 
can’t live without you at the mo- 
ment. Temporarily, I’m madly in 
love with you. I want to share 
my life with you for a while. Will 
you be provisionally mine?” I 
even had a Straightforward Ap- 
proach: “Linda, I’m going to be 
needing a wife for at least a year 
or two, and I can’t think of any- 
one I would rather spend that 
time with than you.” 

Actually, though I wouldn’t 
even have admitted this to Linda, 
much less to anyone else, I loved 
her in more than a Non-P way. 
But even if we both had been 
genetically desirable (neither of 
us were) I knew that Linda rel- 
ished her freedom and independ- 
ence too much to ever contract 
for any kind of marriage other 
than Non-P — Non-Permanent, 
No Progeny. 

So I rehearsed my various ap- 



THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR 



179 



proaches, realizing that when the 
time came I would probably be 
so tongue-tied I’d be capable of 
no more than a blurted, “Will you 
marry me?” and I struggled with 
zippers and malfunctioning air- 
cons, and I managed somehow to 
leave the apartment at five min- 
utes to ten. 

Linda lived down on the hun- 
dred fortieth floor, thirteen stories 
away. It never took more than 
two or three minutes to get to 
her place, so I was giving myself 
plenty of time. 

But then the elevator didn’t 
come. 

I pushed the button, waited, 
and nothing happened. I couldn’t 
understand it. 

The elevator had always 
arrived before, within thirty sec- 
onds of the button being pushed. 
This was a local stop, with 
an elevator that traveled be- 
tween the hundred thirty-third 
floor and the hundred sixty- 
seventh floor, where it was pos- 
sible to make connections for 
either the next local or for the 
express. So it couldn’t be more 
than twenty stories away. And 
this was a non-rush hour. 

I pushed the button again, and 
then I waited some more. I looked 
at my watch and it was three 
minutes to ten. Two minutes, and 
no elevator! If it didn’t arrive this 
instant, this second, I would be 
late. 



It didn’t arrive. 

I vacillated, not knowing what 
to do next. Stay, hoping the ele- 
vator would come after all? Or 
hurry back to the apartment and 
call Linda, to give her advance 
warning that I would be late? 

Ten more seconds, and still no 
elevator. I chose the second al- 
ternative, raced back down the 
hall, and thumbed my way into 
my apartment. I dialed Linda’s 
number, and the screen lit up with 
white letters on black: PRIVACY 
DISCONNECTION. 

Of course! Linda expected me 
at any moment. And she knew 
what I wanted to say to her, so 
quite naturally she had discon- 
nected the phone, to keep us from 
being interrupted. 

Frantic, I dashed from the 
apartment again, back down the 
hall to the elevator, and leaned 
on that blasted button with all 
my weight. Even if the elevator 
should arrive right now, I would 
still be almost a minute late. 

No matter. It didn’t arrive. 

I would have been in a howl- 
ing rage anyway, but this impos- 
sibility piled on top of all the 
other annoyances and breakdowns 
of the day was just too much. I 
went into a frenzy, and kicked 
the elevator door three times be- 
fore I realized I was hurting my- 
self more than I was hurting the 
door. I limped back to the apart- 
ment, fuming, slammed the door 



180 



GALAXY 



behind me, grabbed the phone 
book and looked up the number 
of the Transit Staff. I dialed, pre- 
pared to register a complaint so 
loud they’d be able to hear me in 
sub-basement three. 

I got some more letters that 
spelled: BUSY. 

TT TOOK three tries before I 
•■■got through to a hurried-look- 
ing female receptionist. “My name 
is Rice!” I bellowed. “Edmund 
Rice! I live on the hundred and 
fifty-third floor! I just rang for the 
elevator and — ” 

“The-elevator-is-disconnected.” 
She said it very rapidly, as though 
she were growing very used to 
saying it. 

It only stopped me for a sec- 
ond. “Disconnected? What do 
you mean disconnected? Eleva- 
tors don’t get disconnected!” I told 
her. 

“We - will - resume - service - as - 
soon- as -possible,” she rattled. 
My bellowing was bouncing off 
her like radiation off the Project 
force-screen. 

I changed tactics. First I in- 
haled, making a production out 
of it, giving myself a chance to 
calm down a bit. And then I 
asked, as rationally as you could 
please, ‘Would you mind terribly 
telling me why the elevator is 
disconnected?” 

“I-am-sorry-sir-but-that — ” 

“Stop,” I said. I said it quietly, 



too, but she stopped. I saw her 
looking at me. She hadn’t done 
that before, she’d merely gazed 
blankly at her screen and par- 
roted her responses. 

But now she was actually look- 
ing at me. 

I took advantage of the fact. 
Calmly, rationally, I said to her, 
“I would like to tell you some- 
thing, Miss. I would like to tell 
you just what you people have 
done to me by disconnecting the 
elevator. You have ruined my 
life.” 

She blinked, open-mouthed. 
“Ruined your life?” 

“Precisely.” I found it neces- 
sary to inhale again, even more 
slowly than before. “I was on my 
way,” I explained, “to propose to 
a girl whom I dearly love. In 
every way but one, she is the 
perfect woman. Do you under- 
stand me?” 

She nodded, wide-eyed. I had 
stumbled on a romantic, though I 
was too preoccupied to notice it 
at the time. 

“In every way but one,” I con- 
tinued. “She has one small im- 
perfection, a fixation about punc- 
tuality. And I was supposed to 
meet her at ten o’clock. Tm late /” 
I shook my fist at the screen. “Do 
you realize what you’ve done, 
disconnecting the elevator? Not 
only won’t she marry me, she 
won’t even speak to me! Not now! 
Not after this!” 



THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR 



181 



“Sir,” she said tremulously, 
“please don’t shout.” 

“I’m not shouting!” 

“Sir, I’m terribly sorry. I un- 
derstand your — ” 

“You understand?" I trembled 
with speechless fury. 

She looked all about her, and 
then leaned closer to the screen, 
revealing a cleavage that I was 
too distraught at the moment to 
pay any attention to. “We’re not 
supposed to give this information 
out, sir,” she said, her voice low, 
“but I’m going to tell you, so 
you’ll understand why we had to 
do it. I think it’s perfectly awful 
that it had to ruin things for you 
this way. But the fact of the 
matter is — ” she leaned even 
closer to the screen — “there’s 
a spy in the elevator.” 

II 

TT WAS my turn to be stunned. 

1 just gaped at her. “A — a 
what?” 

“A spy. He was discovered on 
the hundred forty-seventh floor, 
and managed to get into the ele- 
vator before the Army could catch 
him. He jammed it between 
floors. But the Army is doing 
everything it can think of to get 
him out.” 

“Well — but why should there 
be any problem about getting 
him out?” 

“He plugged in the manual 



controls. We can’t control the 
elevator from outside at all. And 
when anyone tries to get into the 
shaft, he aims the elevator at 
them.” 

That sounded impossible. “He 
aims the elevator?” 

“He runs it up and down the 
shaft,” she explained, “trying to 
crush anybody who goes after 
him.” 

“Oh,” I said. “So it might take 
a while.” 

She leaned so close this time 
that even I, distracted as I was, 
could hardly help but take note 
of her cleavage. She whispered, 
“They’re afraid they’ll have to 
starve him out.” 

“Oh, no!” 

She nodded solemnly. “I’m ter- 
ribly sorry, sir,” she said. Then 
she glanced to her right, suddenly 
straightened up again, and said, 
“We-will-resume-service-as-soon- 
as-possible.” Click. Blank screen. 

For a minute or two, all I could 
do was sit and absorb what I’d 
been told. A spy in the elevator! 
A spy who had managed to work 
his way all the way up to the 
hundred forty-seventh floor be- 
fore being unmasked! 

What in the world was the 
matter with the Army? If things 
were getting that lax, the Proj- 
ect was doomed, force-screen or 
no. Who knew how many more 
spies there were in the Project, 
still unsuspected? 



182 



GALAXY 



Until that moment, the state of 
siege in which we all lived had 
had no reality for me. The Proj- 
ect, after all, was self-sufficient 
and completely enclosed. No one 
ever left, no one ever entered. 
Under our roof, we were a nation, 
two hundred stories high. The 
ever-present threat of other proj- 
ects had never been more for 
me — or for most other people 
either, I suspected — than oc- 
casional ore-sleds that didn’t re- 
turn, occasional spies shot down 
as they tried to sneak into the 
building, occasional spies of our 
own leaving the Project in tiny 
radiation-proof cars, hoping to 
get safely within another project 
and bring back news of any im- 
mediate threats and dangers that 
project might be planning for us. 
Most spies didn’t return; most 
ore-sleds did. And within the 
Project life was full, the knowl- 
edge of external dangers merely 
lurking at the backs of our 
minds. After all, those external 
dangers had been no more than 
potential for decades, since what 
Dr. Kilbillie called the Ungentle- 
manly Gentleman’s War. 

Dr. Kilbillie — Intermediate 
Project History, when I was fif- 
teen years old — had private 
names for every major war of the 
twentieth century. There was 
the Ignoble Nobleman’s War, the 
Racial Non-Racial War, and the 
Ungentlemanly Gentleman’s War, 



known to the textbooks of course 
as World Wars One, Two, and 
Three. 

The rise of the Projects, ac- 
cording to Dr. Kilbillie, was the 
result of many many factors, but 
two of the most important were 
the population explosion and the 
Treaty of Oslo. The population 
explosion, of course, meant that 
there was continuously more and 
more people but never any more 
space. So that housing, in the 
historically short time of one cen- 
tury, made a complete transfor- 
mation from horizontal expansion 
to vertical. Before 1900, the vast 
majority of human beings lived 
in tiny huts of from one to five 
stories. By 2000, everybody lived 
in Projects. From the very begin- 
ning, small attempts were made 
to make these Projects more than 
dwelling places. By mid-century, 
Projects (also called apartments 
and co-ops) already included res- 
taurants, shopping centers, baby- 
sitting services, dry cleaners and 
a host of other adjuncts. By the 
end of the century, the Projects 
were completely self-sufficient, 
with food grown hydroponically 
in the sub-basements, separate 
floors set aside for schools and 
churches and factories, robot ore- 
sleds capable of seeking out raw 
materials unavailable within the 
Projects themselves and so on. 
And all because of, among other 
things, the population explosion. 



THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR 



183 



And the Treaty of Oslo. 

It seems there was a power- 
struggle between two sets of 
then-existing nations (they were 
something like Projects, only 
horizontal instead of vertical) 
and both sets were equipped 
with atomic weapons. The 
Treaty of Oslo began by stating 
that atomic war was unthink- 
able, and added that just in 
case anyone happened to think 
of it only tactical atomic weap- 
ons could be used. No strategic 
atomic weapons. (A tactical 
weapon is something you use on 
the soldiers, and a strategic 
weapons is something you use on 
the folks at home.) Oddly enough, 
when somebody did think of the 
war, both sides adhered to the 
Treaty of Oslo, which meant that 
no Projects were bombed. 

Of course, they made up for 
this as best they could by using 
tactical atomic weapons all over 
the place. After the war almost 
the whole world was quite dan- 
gerously radioactive. Except for 
the Projects. Or at least those of 
them which had in time installed 
the force screens which had been 
invented on the very eve of battle, 
and which deflected radioactive 
particles. 

However, what with all of the 
other treaties which were broken 
during the Ungentlemanly Gentle- 
man’s War, by the time it was 
finished nobody was quite sure 



any more who was on whose side. 
That project over there on the 
horizon might be an ally. And 
then again it might not. Since 
they weren’t sure either, it was 
risky to expose yourself in order 
to ask. 

And so life went on, with little 
to remind us of the dangers lurk- 
ing Outside. The basic policy of 
Eternal Vigilance and Instant 
Preparedness was left to the 
Army. The rest of us simply lived 
our lives and let it go at that. 

"OUT now there was a spy in 
^-*the elevator. 

When I thought of how deeply 
he had penetrated our defenses, 
and of how many others there 
might be, still penetrating, I 
shuddered. The walls were our 
safeguards only so long as all po- 
tential enemies were on the 
other side of them. 

I sat shaken, digesting this 
news, until suddenly I remem- 
bered Linda. 

I leaped to my feet, reading 
from my watch that it was now 
ten-fifteen. I dashed once more 
from the apartment and down 
the hall to the elevator, praying 
that the spy had been captured 
by now and that Linda would 
agree with me that a spy in the 
elevator was good and sufficient 
reason for me to be late. 

He was still there. At least, 
the elevator was still out. 



184 



GALAXY 



I sagged against the wall, 
thinking dismal thoughts. Then I 
noticed the door to the right of 
the elevator. Through that door 
was the stairway. 

I hadn’t paid any attention to 
it before. No one ever uses the 
stairs except adventurous young 
boys playing cops and robbers, 
running up and down from land- 
ing to landing. I myself hadn’t set 
foot on a flight of stairs since I 
was twelve years old. 

Actually, the whole idea of 
stairs was ridiculous. We had 
elevators, didn’t we? Usually, I 
mean, when they didn’t contain 
spies. So what was the use of 
stairs? 

Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie 
(a walking library of unnecessary 
information), the Project had 
been built when there still had 
been such things as municipal 
governments (something to do 
with cities, which were more or 
less grouped Projects), and the 
local municipal government had 
had on its books a fire ordinance, 
anachronistic even then, which 
required a complete set of stairs 
in every building constructed in 
the city. Ergo, the Project had 
stairs, thirty-two hundred of them. 

And now, after all these years, 
the stairs might prove useful 
after all. It was only thirteen 
flights to Linda’s floor. At sixteen 
steps a flight, that meant two hun- 
dred and eight steps. 



Could I descend two hundred 
and eight steps for my true love? 
I could. If the door would open. 

It would, though reluctantly. 
Who knew how many years it 
had been since last this door had 
been opened? It squeaked and 
wailed and groaned and finally 
opened half way. I stepped 
through to the musty, dusty land- 
ing, took a deep breath, and 
started down. Eight steps and a 
landing, eight steps and a floor. 
Eight steps and a landing, eight 
steps and a floor. 

On the landing between one 
fifty and one forty-nine, there was 
a smallish door. I paused, looking 
curiously at it, and saw that at 
one time letters had been painted 
on it. The letters had long since 
flaked away, but they left a 
lighter residue of dust than that 
which covered the rest of the 
door. And so the words could still 
be read, if with difficulty. 

I read them. They said: 

EMERGENCY ENTRANCE 
ELEVATOR SHAFT 
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL 
ONLY 

KEEP LOCKED 
I frowned, wondering imme- 
diately why this door wasn’t 
being firmly guarded by at least 
a platoon of Army men. Half a 
dozen possible answers flashed 
through my mind. The more re- 



186 



GALAXY 



cent maps might simply have 
omitted this discarded and un- 
necessary door. It might be sealed 
shut on the other side. The Army 
might have caught be spy al- 
ready. Somebody in authority 
might simply have goofed. 

As I stood there, pondering 
these possibilities, the door 
opened and the spy came out, 
waving a gun. 

Ill 

TTE COULDN’T have been any- 
one else but the spy. The gun, 
in the first place. The fact that 
he looked harried and upset and 
terribly nervous, in the second 
place. And, of course, the fact that 
he came from the elevator shaft. 

Looking back, I think he must 
have been just as startled as 
I when we came face to face like 
that. We formed a brief tableau, 
both of us open-mouthed and 
wide-eyed. 

Unfortunately, he recovered 
first. 

He closed the emergency door 
behind him, quickly but quietly. 
His gun stopped waving around 
and instead pointed directly at 
my middle. “Don’t move!” he 
whispered harshly. “Don’t make 
a sound!” 

I did exactly as I was told. I 
didn’t move and I didn’t make a 
sound. Which left me quite free 
to study him. 



He was rather short, perhaps 
three inches shorter than me, 
with a bony high-cheekboned face 
featuring deepset eyes and a thin- 
lipped mouth. He wore gray 
slacks and shirt, with brown slip- 
pers on his feet. He looked exactly 
like a spy . which is to say that 
he didn’t look like a spy, he looked 
overpoweringly ordinary. More 
than anything else, he reminded 
me of a rather taciturn milkman 
who used to make deliveries to 
my parents’ apartment. 

His gaze darted this way and 
that. Then he motioned with his 
free hand at the descending stairs 
and whispered, “Where do they 
go?” 

I had to clear my throat be- 
fore I could speak. “All the way 
down,” I said. 

“Good,” he said — just as we 
both heard a sudden raucous 
squealing from perhaps four 
flights down, a squealing which 
could be nothing but the opening 
of a hall door. It was followed by 
the heavy thud of ascending boots. 
The Army! 

But if I had any visions of 
imminent rescue, the spy dashed 
them. He said, “Where do you 
live?” 

“One fifty-three,” I said. This 
was a desperate and dangerous 
man. I knew my only slim chance 
of safety lay in answering his 
questions promptly, cooperating 
with him until and unless I saw 



THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR 



187 



a chance to either escape or cap- 
ture him. 

“All right,” he whispered. “Go 
on.” He prodded me with the gun. 

And so we went back up the 
stairs to one fifty-three, and 
stopped at the door. He stood 
close behind me, the gun pressed 
against my back, and grated in 
my ear, “I’ll have this gun in my 
pocket. If you make one false 
move I’ll kill you. Now, we’re 
going to your apartment. We’re 
friends, just strolling along to- 
gether. You got that?” 

I nodded. 

“All right. Let’s go.” 

We went. I have never in my 
life seen that long hall quite so 
empty as it was right then. No 
one came out of any of the apart- 
ments, no one emerged from any 
of the branch halls. We walked to 
my apartment. I thumbed the 
door open and we went inside. 

Once the door was closed be- 
hind us, he visibly relaxed, sag- 
ging against the door, his gun 
hand hanging limp at his side, a 
nervous smile playing across his 
lips. 

I looked at him, judging the 
distance between us, wondering if 
I could leap at him before he 
could bring the gun up again. But 
he must have read my intentions 
on my face. He straightened, shak- 
ing his head. He said, “Don’t try 
it. I don’t want to kill you. I don’t 
want to “kill anybody, but I will 



if I have to. We’ll just wait here 
together until the hue and cry 
passes us. Then I’ll tie you up, so 
you won’t be able to sic your 
Army on me too soon, and I’ll 
leave. If you don’t try any silly 
heroics, nothing will happen to 
you.” 

“You’ll never get away,” I told 
him. “The whole Project is 
alerted.” 

“You let me worry about that,” 
he said. He licked his lips. “You 
got any chico coffee?” 

“Yes.” 

“Make me a cup. And don’t 
get any bright ideas about dous- 
ing me with boiling water.” 

“I only have my day’s allot- 
ment,” I protested. “Just enough 
for two cups, lunch and dinner.” 

“Two cups is fine,” he said. 
“One for each of us.” 

A ND NOW I had yet another 
grudge against this blasted 
spy. Which reminded me again of 
Linda. From the looks of things, 
I wasn’t ever going to get to her 
place. By now she was probably 
in mourning for me and might 
even have the Sanitation Staff 
searching for my remains. 

As I made the chico, he asked 
me questions. My name first, and 
then, ‘What do you do for a liv- 
ing?” 

I thought fast. “I’m an ore-sled 
dispatcher,” I said. That was a 
lie, of course, but I’d heard enough 



188 



GALAXY 



about ore-sled dispatching from 
Linda to be able to maintain the 
fiction should he question me 
further about it. 

Actually, I was a gymnast in- 
structor. The subjects I taught in- 
cluded wrestling, judo and karati 
— talents I would prefer to dis- 
close to him in my own fashion, 
when the time came. 

He was quiet for a moment. 
“What about radiation level on 
the ore-sleds?” 

I had no idea what he was 
talking about, and admitted as 
much. 

‘When they come back,” he 
said. “How much radiation do 
they pick up? Don’t you people 
ever test them?” 

“Of course not,” I told him. I 
was on secure ground now, with 
Linda’s information to guide me. 
“All radiation is cleared from the 
sleds and their cargo before 
they’re brought into the build- 
ing.” 

“I know that,” he said impa- 
tiently. “But don’t you ever check 
them before de-radiating them?” 

“No. Why should we?” 

“To find out how far the radia- 
tion level outside has dropped.” 

“For what? Who cares about 
that?” 

He frowned bitterly. “The same 
answer,” he muttered, more to 
himself than to me. “The same 
answer every time. You people 
have crawled into your, caves and 



you’re ready to stay in them 
forever.” 

I looked around at my apart- 
ment. “Rather a well-appointed 
cave,” I told him. 

“But a cave nevertheless.” He 
leaned toward me, his eyes gleam- 
ing with a fanatical flame. “Don’t 
you ever wish to get Outside?” 
Incredible! I nearly poured 
boiling water all over myself. 
“Outside? Of course not!” 

“The same thing,” he grumbled, 
“over and over again. Always the 
same stupidity. Listen, you! Do 
you realize how long it took man 
to get out of the caves? The long 
slow painful creep of progress, 
for millenia, before he ever made 
that first step from the cave?” 
“I have no idea,” I told him. 
“I’ll tell you this,” he said bel- 
ligerently. “A lot longer than it 
took for him to turn around and 
go right back into the cave again.” 
He started pacing the floor, wav- 
ing the gun around in an agitated 
fashion as he talked. “Is this the 
natural life of man? It is not. Is 
this even a desirable life for man? 
It is definitely not.” He spun back 
to face me, pointing the gun at 
me again, but this time he pointed 
it as though it were a finger, not 
a gun. “Listen, you,” he snapped. 
“Man was progressing. For all his 
stupidities and excesses, he was 
growing up. His dreams were get- 
ting bigger and grander and better 
all the time. He was planning to 



THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR 



189 



tackle space! The moon first, and 
then the planets, and finally the 
stars. The whole universe was out 
there, waiting to be plucked like 
an apple from a tank. And Man 
was reaching out for it.” He 
glared as though daring me to 
doubt it. 

T DECIDED that this man was 
-■-doubly dangerous. Not only 
was he a spy, he was also a 
lunatic. So I had two reasons for 
humoring him. I nodded politely. 

“So what happened?” he de- 
manded, and immediately an- 
swered himself. “I’ll tell you what 
happened! Just as he was about 
to make that first giant step, 
Man got a hotfoot. That’s all it 
was, just a little hotfoot. So what 
did Man do? I’ll tell you what he 
did. He turned around and he ran 
all the way back to the cave he 
started from, his tail between his 
legs. That’s what he did!” 

To say that all of this was in- 
comprehensible would be an ex- 
treme understatement. I fulfilled 
my obligation to this insane dia- 
logue by saying, “Here’s your 
coffee.” 

“Put it on the table,” he said, 
switching instantly from raving 
maniac to watchful spy. 

I put it on the table. He drank 
deep, then carried the cup across 
the room and sat down in my 
favorite chair. He studied me nar- 
rowly, and suddenly said, “What 



did they tell you I was? A spy?” 

“Of course,” I said. 

He grinned bitterly, with one 
side of his mouth. “Of course. 
The damn fools! Spy! What do 
you suppose I’m going to spy 
on?” 

He asked the question so vio- 
lently and urgently that I knew I 
had to answer quickly and well, 
or the, maniac would return. “I — 
I wouldn’t know, exactly,” I stam- 
mered. “Military equipment, I 
suppose.” 

“Military equipment? What 
military equipment? Your Army 
is supplied with uniforms, whistles 
and hand guns, and that’s about 
it.” 

“The defenses — ” I started. 

“The defenses,” he interrupted 
me, “are non-existent. If you mean 
the rocket launchers on the roof, 
they’re rusted through with age. 
And what other defenses are 
there? None.” 

“If you say so,” I replied stiffly. 
The Army claimed that we had 
adequate defense equipment. I 
chose to believe the Army over 
an enemy spy. 

“Your people send out spies, 
too, don’t they?” he demanded. 

“Well, of course.” 

“And what are they supposed 
to spy on?” 

“Well — ” It was such a point- 
less question, it seemed silly to 
even answer it. “They’re supposed 
to look for indications of an 



190 



GALAXY 



attack by one of the other proj- 
ects.” 

“And do they find any indica- 
tions, ever?” 

“I’m sure I don’t know,” I told 
him frostily. “That would be clas- 
sified information.” 

“You bet it would,” he said, 
with malicious glee. “All right, if 
that’s what your spies are doing, 
and if I’m a spy, then it follows 
that I’m doing the same thing, 
right?” 

“I don’t follow you,” I ad- 
mitted. 

“If I’m a spy,” he said impa- 
tiently, “then I’m supposed to look 
for indications of an attack by 
you people on my Project.” 

I shrugged. “If that’s your job,” 
I said, “then that’s your job.” 

He got suddenly red-faced, and 
jumped to his feet. “That’s not 
my job, you blatant idiot!” he 
shouted. “I’m not a spy! If I were 
a spy, then that would be my 
job!” 

r ¥^HE maniac had returned, in 
full force. “All right,” I said 
hastily. “All right, whatever you 
say.” 

He glowered at me a moment 
longer, then shouted, “Bah!” and 
dropped back into the chair. 

He breathed rather heavily for 
a while, glaring at the floor, then 
looked at me again. “All right, 
listen. What if I were to tell you 
that I had found indications that 



you people were planning to 
attack my Project?” 

I stared at him. “That’s impos- 
sible!” I cried. “We aren’t plan- 
ning to attack anybody! We just 
want to be left in peace!” 

“How do I know that?” he de- 
manded. 

“It’s the truth! What would we 
want to attack anybody for?” 
“Ah hah!” He sat forward, 
tensed, pointing the gun at me 
like a finger again. “Now, then,” 
he said. “If you know it doesn’t 
make any sense for this Project 
to attack any other project, then 
why in the world should you 
think they might see some ad- 
vantage in attacking you?” 

I shook my head, dumb- 
founded. “I can’t answer a ques- 
tion like that,” I said. “How do I 
know what they’re thinking?” 
“They’re human beings, aren’t 
they?” he cried. “Like you? Like 
me? Like all the other people in 
this mausoleum?” 

“Now, wait a minute — ” 

“No!” he shouted. “You wait a 
minute! I want to tell you some- 
thing. You think I’m a spy. That 
blundering Army of yours thinks 
I’m a spy. That fathead who 
turned me in thinks I’m a spy. 
But I’m not a spy, and I’m going 
to tell you what I am.” 

I waited, looking as attentive 
as possible. 

“I come,” he said, “from a Proj- 
ect about eighty miles north of 



THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR 



191 



here. I came here by foot, with- 
out any sort of radiation shield at 
all to protect me.” 

The maniac was back. I didn’t 
say a word. I didn’t want to set 
off the violence that was so ob- 
viously in this lunatic. 

“The radiation level,” he went 
on, “is way down. It’s practically 
as low as it was before the Atom 
War. I don’t know how long it’s 
been that low, but I would guess 
about ten years, at the very 
least.” He leaned forward again, 
urgent and serious. “The world is 
safe out there now. Man can come 
back out of the cave again. He 
can start building the dreams 
again. And this time he can build 
better, because he has the hor- 
rible example of the recent past 
to guide him away from the pit- 
falls. There’s no need any longer 
for the Projects.” 

And that was like saying there’s 
no need any longer for stomachs, 
but I didn’t say so. I didn’t say 
anything at all. 

“I’m a trained atomic engineer,” 
he went on. “In my project, I 
worked on the reactor. Theoreti- 
cally, I believed that there was a 
chance the radiation Outside was 
lessening by now, though we had 
no idea exactly how much radia- 
tion had been released by the 
Atom War. But I wanted to test 
the theory, and the Commission 
wouldn’t let me. They claimed 
public safety, but I knew better. 



If the Outside were safe and the 
Projects were no longer needed, 
then the Commission was out of 
a job, and they knew it. 

66%V/ELL, I went ahead with 
the test anyway, and I 
was caught at it. For my punish- 
ment, I was banned from the Proj- 
ect. They kicked me out, tell- 
ing me if I thought it was safe 
Outside I could live Outside. And 
if it really was safe, I could come 
back and tell them. Except that 
they also made it clear that I 
would be shot if I tried to get 
back in, because I would be car- 
rying deadly radiation.” 

He smiled bitterly. “They had 
it all their own way,” he said. 
“But it is safe out there, I’m living 
proof of it. I lived Outside for 
five months. And gradually I 
realized I had to tell others. I 
had to spread the word that Man 
could have his world back. I 
didn’t dare try to get back into 
my own Project; I would have 
been recognized and shot before 
I could say a word. So I came 
here.” 

He paused to finish the cup of 
chico that I should have had 
with lunch. “I knew better,” he 
continued, “than to simply walk 
into the building and announce 
that I came from Outside. Man 
has an instinctive distrust for 
strangers anyway; the Projects 
only intensify it. Once again, I 



192 



GALAXY 



would have been shot. So I’ve 
been working in a more devious 
way. I snuck into the Project — 
not a difficult thing for a man 
with no metal on his person, no 
radiation shield cocooning him — 
and for the last two months I’ve 
been wandering around the build- 
ing, talking with people. I strike 
up a conversation. I try to plant 
a few seeds of doubt about the 
deadliness of Outside, and I hope 
that at least a few of the people 
I talk to will begin to wonder, as 
I once did.” 

Two months! This spy, by his 
own admission, had been in the 
Project two months before being 
detected. I’d never heard of such 
a thing, and I hoped I’d never 
hear of such a thing again. 

“Things worked out pretty 
well,” he said, “until today. I said 
something wrong — I’m still not 
sure what — and the man I was 
talking to hollered for Army, 
shouted I was a spy.” He pounded 
the chair arm. “But I’m not a 
spy! And it’s the truth, Outside is 
safe!” He glared suddenly at the 
window. “Why’ve you got that 
drape up there?” 

“The window broke down,” I 
explained. “It’s stuck at trans- 
parent.” 

“Transparent? Fine!” He got 
up from the chair, strode across 
the room, and ripped the drape 
down from the window. 

I cowered away from the sun- 



glare, turning my back to the 
window. 

“Come over here!” he shouted. 
When I didn’t move, he snarled, 
“Get up and come over here, or 
I swear I’ll shoot!” 

And he would have, it was 
plain in his voice. I got to my feet, 
hesitant, and walked trembling 
to the window, squinting against 
the glare. 

“Look out there,” he ordered. 
“Look!” 

I looked. 

IV 

HPERROR. Horror. Dizziness 
and nausea. 

Far and away and far, nothing 
and nothing. Only the glare, and 
the high blue, and the far far 
horizon, and the broken gray slag 
stretching out, way down below. 

“Do you see?” he demanded. 
“Look down there! We’re so high 
up, it’s hard to see, but look for 
it. Do you see it? Do you see the 
green? Do you know what that 
means? There are green things 
growing again Outside! Not much 
yet. It’s only just started back, 
but it’s begun. The radiation is 
down. Plants are growing again.” 

The power of suggestion. And, 
of course, the heightened sensitivi- 
ty caused by the double threat 
of a man beside me carrying a 
gun that yawning aching expanse 
of nothing beyond the window. 



THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR 



193 



I nearly fancied that I did see 
faint specks of green. 

“Do you see it?” he asked me. 

“Wait,” I said. I leaned closer 
to the window, though every 
nerve in me wanted to leap the 
other way. “Yes!” I said. “Yes, I 
see it! Green!” 

He sighed, a long painful sigh 
of thanksgiving. “Then now you 
know,” he said. “I’ve been telling 
you the truth. It is safe Outside.” 

And my lie worked. For the 
first time, his guard was com- 
pletely down. 

I moved like a whirlwind. I 
leaped, and twisted his arm in a 
hard hammerlock, which caused 
him to cry out and drop the gun. 
That was wrestling. Then I turned 
and twisted and dipped, causing 
him to fly over my head and 
crash to the floor. That was judo. 
Then I jabbed one rigid forefinger 
against a certain spot on the side 
of his neck, causing the blood in 
his veins to forever stop its mo- 
tion. That was karati. 

VW / KLL, by the time the Army 
* * men had finished question- 
ing me, it was three o’clock in 
the afternoon, and I was five 
hours late. The Army men cor- 



roborated my belief that the man 
had been a spy, who had appar- 
ently lost his mind when cor- 
nered in the elevator. Outside was 
still dangerous, of course, they 
assured me of that. And he’d 
been lying about having been here 
two months. He’d been in the 
Project less than two days. Not 
only that, the Army men told me 
they’d found the radiation-proof 
car he’d driven, and in which he 
had hoped to drive back to his 
own Project once he’d discovered 
all our defenses. 

Despite the fact that I had the 
most legitimate excuse for tardi- 
ness under the roof, Linda refused 
to forgive me for not making our 
ten o’clock meeting. When I asked 
her to marry me she refused, at 
length and descriptively. 

But I was surprised and re- 
lieved to discover how rapidly I 
got over my heartbreak. This was 
aided by the fact that once the 
news of my exploit spread, there 
were any number of girls more 
than anxious to get to know me 
better, including the well-cleav- 
aged young lady from the Trans- 
it Staff. After all, I was a hero. 

They even gave me a medal.
