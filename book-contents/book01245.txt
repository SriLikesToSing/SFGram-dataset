PREVIEW — What happens when billions of minute metal particles 
start "bleeding" back from the fourth dimension, perforating with 
fatal results the population of America? The above reproduction 
(black on red tint) is made from the full color cover painting, by 
Kenneth Rossi, which illustrates a scene from the story BLEED- 
BACK, by Winston Marks. This splendid satire of a problem of mys- 
terious magnitude which is finally solved by simplicity itself is in the 
next issue of IF. Watch for this unusual cover, in full color, on your

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

NEWS ABOUT science fiction con- 
ventions all over the country has 
been flowing across our desk in an 
almost continuous stream ever since 
we started IF. Seems as though 
there are people everywhere who 
are really inveterate science fiction 
hobbyists, and they really go all out 
for it in more ways than just read- 
ing the stuff. The favorite gambit 
at these shindigs seems to be the 
auction at which fans vie with each 
other to bid for mint copies of some 
magazine, or an original illustration 
or manuscript. The fans are really 
out to add to their collections, and 
woe betide the guy or gal who tries 
to beat them out of the one particu- 
lar cover or illo that they want. 

On second thought that kind of 
enthusiasm isn’t surprising — recent 
surveys show that “hobbying” (to 
coin a word) is the nation’s biggest 
industry. Sounds absurd, doesn’t it? 
But in a broad sense the “big” in- 



dustries — steel, transportation, com- 
munication, construction, etc., all 
have to take a back seat Of coxirse, 
anything that diverts your mind 
and gives you mental and physical 
stimulation or relaxation is a hobby 
— whether it be sport cars, do-it- 
yourself, collecting science fiction 
illustrations or bird watching. And 
taken in the aggregate it is physical- 
ly and morally a bigger industrial 
giant than any listed on the stock 
exchanges. 

NO OTHER NATION in the 

world has so many ways to relax 
and so much leisure time to relax as 
we do. Here in America the poorest 
man as well as the richest can take 
some time out to get his mind off 
business or personal problems — if he 
wants to. Which is one of the rea- 
sons that we have the strongest na- 
tion the world has ever seen. A na- 
tion that can relax, can rebound; a 
man with a hobby or two to relax 
him now and again isn’t so brittle 
that he’ll crack when tension is ap- 
plied. 

This “hobbying” really makes for 
a titanic industry. According to re- 
cent figures, the do-it-yourself busi- 
ness alone has grown to something 
like $6,000,000,000 annually. That’s 
six billion bucks spent during the 
past year for tools and gimmicks to 
make home-made chairs, tables, doll 
houses, doghouses, playroom bars, 
etc. Hardware manufacturers, paint 
makers, building material fabrica- 
tors provide the materials and even 
produce “do-it-yourself” kits for the 
hobbyist who likes to work with 
wood and metal. More millions 
have gone into a rash of public a- 



2 



tions that have sprung up like 
mushrooms around this business. 
They give you simplified directions, 
advise you what tools you need, ad- 
vise you on technique and even pro- 
vide patterns and blueprints for 
anything from a shoeshine box to a 
ten room house. Industrial exhibits 
put on for do-it-yourself enthusiasts 
draw millions of viewers every year. 

So, despite the fact that we might 
wind up by having the carpenter, 
electrician, plumber or mason to do 
it all over again — that’s beside the 
point; at least we have had the 
fun of monkeying with it ourselves. 
Sure, some folks spend a hundred 
or two hundred bucks for tools and 
make something they couldn’t get 
38 cents for — ^but it was a lot of fun 
and diverted the tensions for a 
while. 

A guy can spend a lot of dough 
for fishing equipment and fish for 
two or three years before he catches 
enough fish to make a healthy 
breakfast — ^but ask any fisherman if 
he can count his fun by the number 
of fish he caught. The same is true 
of those who hunt, or play golf, or 
collect butterflies, or do crossword 
puzzles. I know someone who col- 
lects the covers on paper matches — 
does it with a passion — and it’s a 
really fascinating collection. You 
never knew so many different mes- 
sages and pictures could be put on 
match book covers. And this person, 
who spends very little now and then 
for scotch tape and loose leaf sheets, 
gets as much kick out of this collec- 
tion, which comes from all over the 
world, as the man who spends thou- 



sands of dollars on his gun collec- 
tion. My wife collects miniature 
porcelain rabbits and I’ve found out 
that the porcelain type is dam near 
as prolific as the meat and fur type. 
If you think about it for a minute 
you’ll realize that almost everyone 
you know collects something . 
from buttons to furniture. 

BUT THE IDEA of this isn’t to 
enumerate hobbies or the expenses 
involved. The point is that a hobby, 
or some form of relaxation, is im- 
portant business and, what’s more 
vital, is excellent and important 
therapy for all of us who live in a 
tense world. Discuss a person’s hob- 
by and watch him glow, watch the 
animation that lights his face 
whether he’s listening or talking. 
Try a business conversation gambit 
with a stranger on a train and the 
fountain of talk dries up pretty fast ; 
he’s relaxing at the moment and 
doesn’t want to get tied up in men- 
tal knots or petty shop talk. Look 
around, take stock of some of the 
folks you know both socially and in 
a business way . we’ll wager a 
“do-it-yourself” kit that the cranks, 
the malcontents are the ones who 
haven’t got a hobby. 

So, three bows to the hobby in- 
dustry, may it grow even bigger 
and bigger. Its products are prob- 
ably the closest thing to a cure-all 
that Mankind has yet come across. 
The relaxation afforded by a change 
of pace in thinking, in physical ef- 
fort, in mental approach, makes 
America and Americans healthier — 
in every way. — ^jlq

THE STRANGERS 



Though he had been molded y he had also been broken. 



Yety as they laughed at himy they feared him — for 



they shared a knowledge he didnt know he possessed. 



S PENCER set the ice-filled glass 
back on the bar and flicked the 
two bent and sodden straws that 
hung over the lip. “Happy Birth- 
day to me,” he whispered to him- 
self, and hit the straws so sharply 
that they danced halfway around 
the inside of the glass. 

So much for the past twenty- 
four years. Eighteen years of hav- 
ing it good, six of having it bad. 

He raised a finger at the bartend- 



er and pushed his glass forward. 
The man nodded and began to mix 
a fresh drink. 

Six years of being half a man. 
After eighteen years of training to 
be something more than a man. 

Spencer hitched his bad leg 
awkwardly around on the stool, 
fumbling in his pockets for a match. 

“Mr. Laban is dead, I’m afraid.” 
The voice was quiet, but firmly 
modulated — the voice of that rare 



4 




animal, the trained elocutionist. 

Or the operatic singer, Spencer 
thought inanely as his head 
snapped around and he looked at 
the man who suddenly sat beside 
him. 

His hair was gray — prematurely 
so, to judge by his tanned, lean 
face, which was neither lined nor 
rough-skinned. His eyes sparked 
with the poise and confidence im- 
plicit in the graceful carriage of 
his body. He was not consciously 
drawn up for inspection. He simply 
radiated unshakable grace and 
capability. 

“How do you know and how’d 
you find me?” Spencer demanded. 

The man reached out, metal 
glittering in his tapered fingertips, 
and lit Spencer’s cigarette. “He 
died of a heart attack early this 
morning.” 

For the first time, Spencer real- 
ized how much alcohol was at 
work in his system. He was finding 
it difficult to concentrate. Sus- 
tained thought was impossible. 

“What’s your name, fellow?” he 
asked harshly. 

The graceful man smiled. “It 
doesn’t mean anything to you? Mr. 
Laban’s death?” 

“What kind of a question is 
that? Of course it means some- 
thing — if it’s true. I knew him for 
a long time. He did a lot for me. 
I’m as human as the next guy.” 

The man raised his eyebrows in 
polite arches. “Ah?” Then he 
smiled fleetingly. “I’m sorry. You 
seem to have misunderstood my 
meaning.” He laughed — a surpris- 
ingly bass sound that filled the 
small bar for a brief moment, dying 



out before it attracted attention. 
“All right,” he said as though 
something Spencer said had pleased 
him very much “Good night.” He 
slipped off his stool. 

“Wait a minute! Where’s his 
body?” 

The graceful man shook his 
head. “I don’t know. I don’t sup- 
pose it really matters.” He stepped 
away, and with a wave of his hand, 
was gone up the shadowy stairs to 
the street. 

Spencer looked after him, frown- 
ing. He shook his head sharply to 
wipe some of the fog out of his 
forebrain and half pushed himself 
off his stool, but the bartender 
touched his arm. 

“Your drink, sir.” 

“Uh? Oh, thanks — what do I 
owe you?” 

He gulped the drink while the 
bartender made change, and got 
up the stairs as rapidly as he covdd, 
but the graceful man was out of 
sight by then. 

Spencer cursed his drinking. 
He’d picked a fine time. 

On the other hand, if he hadn’t 
been in the bar, the graceful man 
wouldn’t have found him. 

That seemed a thin thesis, some- 
how. Very thin. The man had 
found him here — ^he could have 
found him anywhere else. 

Spencer couldn’t decide what to 
do now. All his thought processes 
seemed trapped in some maze that 
let them scurry aroimd and around, 
with never a clear channel in 
which to flow. And now the com- 
plicated emotions of grief, regret, 
and remembrance, with their at- 
tendant hosts of bitterness, were 



6 



ALGIS BUDRYS 




crowding into the maze, leaving no 
room for anything more. 

He wondered, fleetingly, what 
the graceful man’s purpose might 
have been, but he had to let that 
curiosity pass for the moment. In 
any case, whatever the graceful 
man had been trying to accom- 
plish, he had failed. 

Except that he hadn’t seemed 
disapp)ointed. On the contrary. 

Spencer frowned again. He 
threw away his cigarette and lit a 
fresh one. Walking awkwardly, lost 
in thought, his shoe-sole slurring 
on the sidewalk, he made his way 
down the dark street. 



H e found himself on a bench 
in Washington Square. 

Let us go back, he thought as he 
leaned his forehead on his palms. 
Let us review the case. 

Westen Hillyard Spencer, b. 
1/9/32. d.? 

Hgt: 5', 11" Wght: 178 lb.

He coughed smoke out of his 
raw throat and smiled sardonical- 
ly. He was going to hate himself in 
Ae morning. 

“Which,” he said aloud to the 
Borough of Manhattan, “is not 
strictly unprecedented.” 

On three drinks? 

His forehead knotted convulsive- 
ly. It had been only three, hadn’t 

THE STRANGERS 



it? What was happening to his 
liquor capacity? 

But his consciousness was drift- 
ing away from his surroundings 
and he was surrendering to the tide 
of memory. 

Mr. Laban had been a strange 
man. Where had he come from? 
Spencer frowned as he tried to re- 
member the answer and could not 
find it. It seemed as though his 
family had always known the care- 
fully-dressed man with the gold- 
headed stick which he carried al- 
most like a sword, and behind 
whose eyes burned the unusual fire 
of some extraordinary drive. Cer- 
tainly, he had been a visitor in the 
Spencer home since the beginning 
of Westen’ s memories. 

No — Mr. Laban had certainly 
visited the Spencer home, but he 
was not a visitor, in the ordinary 
sense of the word. Nor was it Wes- 
ten’s parents that he came to see. 
But there seemed no adequate way 
of describing precisely what that 
complicated relationship between 
them had been. 

His visits had been all alike, no 
matter where the Spencers hap- 
pened to be living. Unannounced 
and unexpected, there would be 
the thump of the stick on the door- 
mat, and then the knock on the 
door. 

“George! It’s Mr, Laban!” His 
mother’s voice — suddenly tense 

and uneasy. 

“I heard it!” His father — sud- 
denly irritated. Then his father’s 
sigh, and a look of resignation 
crossing his features. “You want to 



7 




answer it, Madge?” 

“Can’t you? Just this once? I 
mean. I’m wearing this awful 
apron — ” 

And his father would sigh once 
more, and go to the door where 
Mr. Laban waited without knock- 
ing again, as if sure there was 
someone coming to let him in, as 
there always was. And his mother 
woxdd dart into the kitchen. Some- 
times, she didn’t come out until 
Mr. Laban was gone. If Mr. Laban 
ever noticed her absence, or over- 
heard the fretful discussion that 
followed his knock, he gave no 
sign of it. 

George Spencer would open the 
door. 

“Hello, George, how are you?” 
Mr. Laban’s voice was a deep, con- 
fident bass, resonant with vigor and 
self-assurance. “Is Westen at 
home?” 

“Hello, Mr. Lab^. Yes, he’s 
home.” Westen noticed that his 
father never added that, somehow, 
Westen was always at home when 
Mr. Laban came. He merely took 
Mr. Laban’s hat and stick, and 
then called: “Westen! Wes! Mr. 
Laban’s here.” Westen always 
knew it was Mr. Laban as soon as 
he heard the thump of the stick 
outside the door. He would come 
into the parlor, where Mr. Laban 
was standing in the middle of the 
rug, smiling and waiting for him. 

Then, out of Mr. Laban’s 
pockets would come the candy bars 
and the bright packages of chew- 
ing gum — “Mind, Westen, save the 
wrappers to throw the gum away 
in.” — and the shining half-dollars 
— “I won’t have time to stay and 

8 



take you to the movies, Westen, 
but Great Expectations is playing 
downtown, and I’d like you to see 
it. See what you can learn from it. 
If you like it, go down to the li- 
brary afterwards and borrow the 
book. There are some valuable 
things in it — some very valuable 
things.” 

He had never been sure of how 
he really felt about Mr. Laban. Mr. 
Laban was like aunts and uncles — 
he was there, and he was thereby 
unquestionable. It was a long time 
before he even began to wonder 
why, if his parents were so upset 
by Mr. Laban’s visits, those visits 
continued. But, all through his 
youth, it was a part of his life to 
come downstairs whenever he was 
called and told that the dignified, 
dark-haired man — ^in the suits that 
were much better tailored than 
George Spencer’s — was waiting to 
see him. He would wait until the 
first rush of candy and half-dollars 
was over, for then he and Mr. La- 
ban could sit down on the sofa. 
Mr. Laban would talk to him, 
choosing his words and expressions 
carefully, in a quiet and measured 
tone that his father never seemed 
to use with him. 

“Well, Westen, have you thought 
over what we talked about last 
time?” 

“About the chrysalids, sir?” 

“That’s right, Westen. Did you 
take the books out of the library?” 

“Yes, sir. The lady thought it 
was funny for me to take them out 
— she thought I was a little boy, 
and she wanted me to take out one 
of those books they have. You 
know, like in primary grades. But 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




I told her you wanted me to read 
them, and she said she guessed — 
she supposed — it was all right. Are 
you my tutor?” 

“Why, yes, Westen, I suppose I 
am. It’s perfectly all right for you 
to say so, at any rate, as long as 
that’ll get you the books. That’s 
something else for you to remem- 
ber. Sometimes it’s all right to tell 
people things they think are so, 
even if they aren’t, as long as you 
know you’re doing it for a good 
purpose. But what did you learn 
from the books?” 

“Well, sir, there are certain 
kinds of insects that m2ike a sort of 
shell around themselves, and live 
in it until they’re ready to come 
out, and then they’re moths. The 
shell is called a chrysalis, and it’s 
sort of hard inte — in^^gument. 
And — ” 

“That’s fine, Westen. I don’t ex- 
pect you to be able to tell me all 
you’ve learned, because it’s not 
necessary. If you’ve read the books 
carefully, all the information has 
been stored in your brain, and will 
be available all your life, even if 
you seem to forget it after a while. 
Remember what I told you about 
background?” 

“Yes, sir. I don’t have to mem- 
orize everything — not like poems, 
or multiplication tables. It’s still in 
me, even if I can’t just say it right 
off, and every time I learn some- 
thing new it gets added to my old 
background, and all the pieces of 
what I know get hooked together. 
Then, when I grow up, I’ll be able 
to use all those hooked-together 
pieces without really remembering 
every piece all the way through. 

THE STRANGERS 



I’ll just know what to do.” 

“That’s right, Westen. When 
you grow up, you’ll know what to 
do.” 



A S HE thought of it now, Westen 
L still could not understand how 
his parents could have been so in- 
effectual. Certainly, they must have 
resented Mr. Laban. Admittedly, 
there had been something uncom- 
fortable to them in Mr. Laban’s 
interest. It had been a strange sort 
of interest, too — somewhat like 
that of the rich, resented uncle 
who was not really doing too much 
for his favorite poor nephew 
now, but who, in the future, 
might. 

The train of implication was 
obvious. 

And yet, Mr. Laban had never 
said anything of that nature, or 
even hinted at it. There had sim- 
ply been a manner in his attitude 
toward Wes, a tone in the words he 
spoke to him, that seemed to trace 
the far-off but definite outlines of 
a wonderful and exciting future. 
With each of Mr. Laban’s visits, 
varied in length and frequency as 
they had been, that atmosphere of 
expectation had grown more tan- 
gible, and the shape of the future 
had seemed more real. 

“Well, now, Westen, I suppose 
you’d like to go on to college?” Mr. 
Laban was older now. His hair had 
grayed slightly, but his eyes still 
glowed with their unfathomable 
drive, and his expression showed 
no lessening of the quiet confidence 
he felt in that future whose sketchy 

9 




outlines were taking on more and 
more concreteness. 

Spencer shuffled his feet awk- 
wardly. In the past few years he 
had become increasingly aware of 
the discomfort Mr. Laban’s visits 
brought to his home. But he en- 
joyed his talks with the quiet man 
whose sentences fell into measured 
paragraphs, building verbal struc- 
tures of logic and thought. As his 
parents lapsed into a gray ano- 
nymity of word and action, he 
found himself more and more 
drawn to Mr. Laban. Their rela- 
tionship had slowly but systemati- 
cally shifted to an intellectual peer- 
age. Nevertheless, he knew that his 
parents regarded that relationship 
with a sort of hopeless desperation 
— as though some force had pro- 
gressively drawn their only child 
away from them, sapping their 
first hope and pride in a son to 
carry on the heritage of their name. 

So, now, he hesitated. 

“Well, Mr. Laban, I don’t know. 
I’d like to, I suppose. But it’d be 
kind of hard on my parents. Even 
if I earned enough money to put 
me through school, there’d be at 
least four years before I was do- 
ing anything to help them out. My 
father isn’t earning as much as he 
used to.” 

“Yes, yes, that’s a point. A good 
point. But remember that your fa- 
ther wouldn’t have to contribute 
to your support any longer, either. 
It seems to me that his pay is large 
enough to provide for your mother 
and himself. 

“It would be a shame to miss 
what a college education can of- 
fer you, Westen. Reading, by it- 

10 



self, is not enough. Trained habits 
of thought and investigation must 
be established. Classroom discus- 
sion is extremely stimulating. There 
is only so much that one mind, 
thinking alone, can accomplish. 

“I’d like you to study advanced 
mathematics, too. There is much 
to be learned from topology and 
non-Euclidean geometry. Very 
much. Such information can be 
very useful to you in your later 
life.” 

“I’d like to, Mr. Laban. But I 
don’t know. .” He found it hard 
to raise even that weak objection 
in the face of Mr. Laban’s urgent 
desire for him to go. 

“Of course, Westen. It’s not a 
decision I’d want you to make in a 
moment. Think it over. I’m sure 
you’ll do what seems to be the best 
thing.” 

Mr. Laban let the topic lapse, 
his interest shifting. 

“I suppose you’ve got a young 
lady these days, eh, Westen?” 

Spencer found himself blushing, 
to his dismay. “Well, uh, no one 
in particular, sir.” 

Mr. Laban smiled — the wise, 
kind smile that crossed his quiet 
features from time to time. 

“That’s as it should be at your 
age. Some time — next year, per- 
haps — I’d like you to meet some- 
one I know. She’s a fine girl. A 
warm, sensitive person. I’m sure 
you’d like her.” 

Spencer flushed again, and sub- 
stituted an uncomfortable smile for 
his lack of an answer. Mr. Laban 
smiled understandingly in return. 

And he had gone to college. 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




A small, not-tcx>-eminent school 
which could, however, be the step- 
ping-stone for a later transfer to 
a more famous institution. More- 
over, Mr. Laban had arranged for 
a sports scholarship that left him 
free to spend more time in study 
without having to work. 

And now he remembered his 
parents, when he had left them at 
the bus station. His mother and fa- 
ther had been thin, bleached-out 
wraiths of the people he remem- 
bered from his early childhood. 

His mother had cried weakly, 
and clung to him, while his father 
had gripped his hand more strong- 
ly than he ever had before. 

“Wes, I hope you do yourself 
good down there,” he had said. His 
face drifted into an acceptance of 
p>ermanent frustration. “I guess 
there’re people who know some- 
thing most other people don’t — 
people who can get almost any- 
thing they want out of life. They 
know how to make other people do 
things their way. I don’t know — 
we haven’t been as close to you as 
your mother and I would have 
liked, maybe. But if they can teach 
you how to be one of those people, 
well. I haven’t got it figured 
out into the right words, I guess.” 

He stopped, and his grip grew 
even tighter. “Anyway — good luck, 
Wes.” 



T he goalposts were etched in 
white against the flat blue of 
the sky that towered over the backs 
of the dun jerseys in front of him. 
Gravel and scattered clumps of 
grass churned under his feet as he 

THE STRANGERS 



back-pedalled, feeling the muscles 
of his calves and thighs taking the 
impacts in coiled surety. 

There was a voice, cracking out 
over the field, spattering off the 
almost empty stands in this prac- 
tice session, and the dun jerseys 
were weaving back and forth in re- 
sponse to the signals. 

Most important, there was a 
ball. It flickered back. A man 
caught it, spun, feinted to the l^ft 
side of the line, spun again, leaped, 
and lobbed the ball further back. 
Another man took it, touched one 
blunt nose down, and then Spencer 
felt the surge beginning at the sole 
of his foot, rolling up calf and 
thigh, and felt the momentum 
gathering in his body as he drove 
forward. Then his right leg lashed 
out for the last time, with all his 
weight and hurtling mass behind 
it. The ball boomed like a beaten 
drum, and rose toward the hori- 
zontal crossbar. 

He grinned, his lips in a thin line 
that dug back into his cheeks at the 
comers. He kept his eye on the 
ball, and did not see the B Team’s 
dun jerseys hurtling aside as the 
green-and-silken-white varsity can- 
noned through the light and mill- 
ing line. His foot was still in the 
air, and he balanced on his left toe. 

Suddenly there was gravel in his 
mouth, and he spat it out. He kept 
his eyes closed, breathing despite 
the knife-edge that touched him 
whenever his ribs rose or fell. He 
spat again. The gravel had tasted 
bloody. 

There were men surging around 
him. He heard the coach come 
lumbering up, heard his savage bel- 

11 




low at his assistant. 

®‘What kind of crazy play was 
that?” 

The assistant stumbled over his 
words in the face of the coach’s 
violence. “Gee, Andy, it was just a 
thing I had dreamed up to get 
everybody warmed up fast. Have 
everybody working their specialty 
at the same time.” 

“There’s better ways than hav- 
ing them practice illegal plays!” 

“I’m sorry, Andy,” the assistant 
said flatly. 

“What about Spencer, here?” 
the coach demanded. 

“Had the wind knocked out of 
him, I guess.” The assistant’s voice 
had a shrug in it. There was a pe- 
culiar edge to the man’s words. 

Spencer felt the coach’s bulk 
squatting down beside him. “How 
is it, kid?” The bellowing voice was 
gentle. 

Spencer tried to make some sort 
of sound, but he found that the 
best he could do was to cough air 
out of his throat in a series of ugly 
grunts. He felt the coach’s urgent 
fingers touching the side of his 
mouth where the blood must have 
been trickling out, then felt gravel 
rebound from his side as the coach 
leaped to his feet and spun, shout- 
ing for the trainer. 

As he could not remember the 
eleven men hitting him, so he could 
not now recall the interval between 
the coach’s frantic shouts and the 
time when he opened his eyes. The 
two squads of players, the coach, 
and the assistant were standing 
around him, towering over his 
face. The trainer was cursing as he 
worked. 

12 



He moved his eyes slowly up to- 
ward the assistant coach. Strange, 
that on such a hot, bright day a 
man’s face could be completely free 
of perspiration, the eyes wide open 
in the glare, with something smil- 
ing slightly in them. 

Spencer remembered thinking: 
It^s my ribs, damn it! Leave the leg 
alone! But it turned out to be the 
leg, too. 

Mr. Laban came to see him in 
the student infirmary. The cane 
thumped on the composition floor- 
ing outside the door of his room, 
and Spencer came awake instantly. 
His mind cleared of the drifting 
semi-lethargy that a month in the 
traction sling had brought. Then 
the door opened, and he saw the 
man — the much older man, he saw 
with sharp dismay — who neverthe- 
less still carried pride and dignity 
on his shoulders. 

“Mr. Laban!” 

“How are you, Westen?” The 
voice was quiet. 

Not so much quiet as still, Spen- 
cer realized, his dismay growing. 
And pride and dignity were not, 
somehow, proper substitutes for 
confidence. 

His mouth quirked sidewise in a 
crooked smile, and he gestured at 
the ropework stretching his body. 
“I’m about as well off as you could 
expect.” 

“Yes. Um — ^yes, yes,” Mr. Laban 
murmured absently. He pulled a 
chair away from the wall and sat 
down at the foot of Spencer’s bed. 
He reached out awkwardly and 
touched the heavy cast on Westen’ s 
leg, as though hoping against hope 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




that it was not really solid. “Westen 
— I*m — I’m sorry.” 

“So am I. But it’s not anybody’s 
fault.” Spencer shrugged. 

Mr. Laban shook his head quick- 
ly. “It was mine. I sent you down 
here. I knew they’d try to get at 
you, but I thought they wouldn’t 
be able to. I misjudged.” 

Spencer looked at him in be- 
wilderment, “I’m afraid I don’t 
follow you,” he told him, wonder- 
ing just how badly Mr. Laban was 
feeling — whether the sharp change 
in his manner had gone so far as 
to leave him with a vague perse- 
cution mania. 

But Mr. Laban was going on. 
“Westen — ^your parents have passed 
away.” 

Spencer lay suspended, his mind 
sagging in concert with his body. 

“They both had very bad 
hearts,” Mr. Laban said. “They 
died almost together.” 

“I didn’t know,” Spencer said 
tonelessly. 

“It only happened yesterday.” 

He hadn’t known they were sick, 
was what he’d meant, but Spencer 
only nodded. Somehow, he didn’t 
want to talk about them. 

“What do you plan to do after 
you’re well?” Mr. Laban asked, his 
sequence of thought leaping urgent- 
ly from point to point without 
pause, as though he did not have 
much time. 

The question shocked Spencer. 
Didn’t Mr. Laban have some plan? 

“I don’t know,” he answered 
finally. “They cancelled the scholar- 
ship.” 

Mr. Laban nodded. “It’s a small 
school. And it wasn’t really their 

THE STRANGERS 



responsibility. They’re paying for 
your treatment.” 

“Sure. When they figure out a 
way to buy me a new hip, I’m sure 
they’ll let me know.” 

“Westen!” But the protest was 
perfunctory. The purpose was gone 
from Mr. Laban’s manner, and he 
acted like a man picking up the 
fragments of a broken, valuable 
possession that could never be 
made whole again. 

“All right, Westen, perhaps you 
know the best way for you to feel. 
I’ve arranged a position for you. 
A very reputable New York con- 
cern. If you do your work as well 
as I’m sure you can, you’ll have a 
secure place in the company for 
the rest of your life.” 

Mr. Laban stood up. “I’m sorry 
if I seem brusque.” He rubbed his 
forehead for a moment. “I’m all 
alone, suddenly, and there’s so 
much to do. I’m older than I 
should be.” He began putting his 
chair back in its place. 

Spencer felt something boiling 
inside him. It was too much. To 
pick up a boy, split him off from 
his parents, push him, pull him, 
nudge him into the rough sem- 
blance of a shape he was to assume 
• — and then drop him. Too much, 
to come here and deliver a series of 
blows like this, then to mutter an 
apology and go. 

“Mr. Laban!” 

“Westen, I’m sorry. Deeply 
sorry.” 

Spencer shook his head emphati- 
cally. ‘Tm sorry, Mr. Laban, but 
I deserve more than that. Some 
sort of explanation, at least.” 

Mr. Laban gazed down at him 



13 




through his tired eyes. Finally he 
sighed. “Yes, you do, Westen. But 
I can’t give it to you.” 

Spencer’s lips compressed. “Mr. 
Laban — have you ever been hit 
high and low at the same time? 
When you didn’t have the faintest 
expectation of it?” 

Mr. Laban . nodded slowly. 
“Many times. I understand what 
you feel, Westen.” 

“I’m sorry, but I can’t accept 
that. I have been hit that way. 
Twice. Once out on that field, and 
by you, just now. It sort of sep- 
arates the boy from the man. And 
I’ll tell you this, flat out; I know 
something funny’s been going on. 
You didn’t pick me up because of 
rny curly hair or bright eyes. You 
haven’t been grooming me all my 
life for any clerkship. And I didn’t 
get the business because somebody 
was afraid I’d steal the job in the 
bank from some relative of theirs. 
And unless you tell me now — right 
now— what’s been going on, I’ll 
find out. Then I’m going to blow 
the whole thing wide open, and 
you might not like where the pieces 
fall. So let’s do it the easy way.” 
He sank back as far as the 
framework would let him, sur- 
prised at himself, as though some 
unexpected predator had struck 
out the darkness behind his con- 
scious mind. 

Mr. Laban, too, was looking at 
him oddly. Then he nodded slow- 
ly. “Perhaps you’re right.” He 
frowned, as though arguing with 
himself. “I hadn’t considered that 
reaction on your part.” 

He gestured helplessly. “But I 
can^'t tell you everything. For your 

14 



own good — ” He nodded to re- 
affirm the point as Spencer gri- 
maced his annoyance. ^^Yes, Wes- 
ten — believe me. You’ve taken my 
word before. Take it again. I can 
tell you this; you’re quite right. I 
had plans for you. And you had 
the original qualifications to ful- 
fill them. Those plans are at cross- 
purposes with those of another 
group as powerful as ours — as 
mine. And we do not clash on a 
level which even modern science 
for all its microscopes and tele- 
scopes, can detect. You might 
argue with me. You might point to 
your broken bones. Believe me, 
Westen — that is only the path of 
the . the bullet, if you visualize 
in those terms. The damage is 
deeper, and far less easy to repair. 
Impossible to repair. It is in your 
mind, Westen. The damage to your 
body is nothing — or, if anything, 
only a means to an end. It has put 
you on the defensive — given you a 
badge of inferiority. You may not 
realize it now. But you will never 
again feel yourself equal to any set- 
back or obstacle which might ap- 
pear. At the crucial moment when 
only a firm self-confidence could 
support you, you would remember 
your damaged body. You would 
feel the psychological weight of be- 
ing — forgive me — a cripple. You 
would falter. 

“And where we fight — and in 
the way we fight — there can be no 
faltering.” 

He stopped and looked quickly 
at Spencer. “That is the truth, as 
much as I can give it to you. You 
will find it difficult to believe. I’m 
sorry about that.

“Wcsten — ^it might be best if you 
forgot some of the things we’ve 
talked about in the past. I think 
you’ve realized for some time that 
I was training you toward an un- 
derstanding of things which very 
few men have ever understood be- 
fore. Now I have told you, as much 
as I am able, why I was doing it. 
And you must take my word for it 
that the old goal is now unattain- 
able. Consider the forces in play 
here. Try to forget. It would be ter- 
ribly dangerous for you to attempt 
anything else.” 

He looked at Spencer’s ruined 
body, and spread his hands helpless- 
ly. “Please forgive me.” He reached 
the door, shoulders sagging. 

Spencer stared after him. Sud- 
denly, he was remembering all of 
Mr. Laban’s kindnesses, and the 
picture of Mr. Laban as he had 
been — confident, his step alive, his 
cane swinging incisively. It did not 
matter whether he believed Mr. 
Laban now or not — ^he could not let 
the old man leave this way, hag- 
ridden. 

He called out sharply, trying to 
offer him a straw. 

“You mentioned a girl once, Mr. 
Laban. I don’t know how, but 
couldn’t she help you?” 

Mr. Laban shook his Head sadly. 
“Giulia? No, no. I failed with her, 
too.” His voice dropped once more. 
“I thought, for a while . .” He 
opened the door, staring into space. 
“Hopeless,” he murmured. The 
door began to close. 

“Goodbye, Mr. Laban.” 

“Goodbye, Spencer. I — I am sor- 
ry your parents died.” And then 
the door closed. 



T he position was a junior 
clerkship in a bank. He’d had 
to start low. Personnel managers 
didn’t take as kindly to football 
men as most schools like to think, 
and one year of college wasn’t much 
anyway. But starting low was good 
enough if you could work yoiur way 
up in a hurry. 

A man who had to walk slowly 
could usually devote himself to 
thinking fast. A low, crookedly tri- 
umphant smile ran across Spencer’s 
mouth. 

And life was a remarkably mal- 
leable medium. The smile hooked 
more sharply as he remembered the 
hurt and bewildered adolescent 
who had felt so sloppily emotional 
when Mr. Laban left him in the in- 
firmary. It was quite possible to 
shape an attitude and atmosphere 
in oneself which precluded any 
more opportunities for hurt or help- 
lessness. 

But, with banks as with all higher 
form of human endeavor, there is 
a stratum at whose underside every 
man must halt. Some beat their 
wings frantically against the glassy 
surface, refusing to admit that it 
takes time for a vice president to 
die so that a division head may take 
his place, thus leaving a vacuum to 
be filled with the rarified gas of a 
section manager who, in turn, 
leaves a breach through which the 
senior clerk may leap into the sun 
of the private payroll. 

Spencer had touched that stra- 
tum, recognized it for what it was, 
and given notice, all in the course 
of a week. 

That had been a few weeks ago. 
Mr. Laban had not even known 



THE STRANGERS 



15 




his protege was on the bum. Now, 
he would never know. 

He did not remember getting up 
from the park bench, but suddenly 
he realized that he was leaning 
against the inside of the arch 
at the foot of Fifth Avenue, where 
he had no business being, where 
it was physically dangerous to be, 
since his feet were planted in 
the roadway. But he was too busy 
thinking of the desperate, aging 
man with the dying fire behind his 
eyes. 

Spencer shook his head in the 
cloying darkness of the midsummer 
night. Mr. Laban was dead. What- 
ever the old man’s future had been, 
he had never reached it. 

So, the rich uncle had never left 
his fortune to his nephew. Great 
Expectations, Mr. Laban had never 
dreamed that the parallel might 
be so close. 

Spencer shrugged up at the over- 
hanging face of an apartment 
house. Perhaps he’d made an heir 
of his niece, after all. What was the 
girl’s name again? Julia? No, not 
quite Julia but the slightly different 
and more lilting Giulia. He had 
never heard her last name. 

Coincidents were rampant all 
around him in his life. The graceful 
man had been sitting beside him in 
the bar. Another coincidence. And, 
it was yet another accident that the 
light, open-topped car hummed to 
a stop beside him. He turned his 
blank face toward it, and found 
himself looking into the grave 
brown eyes of a slender-faced girl 
whose chestnut hair was drawn 



sharply back over one ear and 
swirled down over her other 
shoulder. Her deep, full-red lips 
were slightly parted. Her voice car- 
ried a ghost of uncertainty. 

“You shouldn’t be standing there, 
you know,” she said, but the light 
words were not as casual as they 
should have been, and she was 
looking at him with an odd in- 
tensity of interest. 

He looked at her speechlessly for 
a moment. This is my night for 
characters, he thought. Well, Tm 
in the right neighborhood. 

But, for some reason, he found 
himself drawn to this girl with even 
more than the amount of interest to 
be expected. 

Hot damn! Adventure corn.es to 
my hum-drum life! he tried to gibe 
the odd feeling away, but could not 
quite succeed. And because it was 
a midsummer’s night, and he stood, 
still vaguely adrift in alcohol, at the 
foot of a fabulous street, he shook 
his head gently and answered her. 
“I don’t really know why I’m stand- 
ing here. You have funny-shaped 
ears.” 

She stared at him for one blank 
instant, her dark eyebrows like 
wings. Then she laughed. 

“My name’s Giulia.” 

He smiled crookedly. ‘T was just 
thinking of you.” What the hell, it 
was a half-truth, wasn’t it? 

“You were?” she frowned. 

“Sure. My name’s Wes.” 

Her mouth trembled into sur- 
prise, and she grew a little pale. 
“But I was just thinking of you!” 

They looked at each other blank- 
ly, not quite ready to accept the 
coincidence at its face value. 



16

“Well/’ he said finally. “Fancy 
that.” 

“Y — ^yes,” she answered. She was 
lost in thought for a moment. 
“Well. Would — would you like to 
go for a ride?” 

Why not? He nodded. He took 
his hand away from the side of the 
arch and walked around the nose 
of the car to the other door. He 
felt his right foot touch the asphalt 
crookedly, felt the straining half- 
jammed action of his hip, and the 
bitterness in him snarled — ^but did 
not cry very loudly, or else the mid- 
summer night and something else, 
equally intangible and equally po- 
tent, came in and hushed it. 

I’m a commercial artist,” she 
said hours later. The Hudson glim- 
mered as the car ran along the 
broad arm of the George Washing- 
ton Bridge. The breeze touched 
them with its fond coolness. “What 
do you do?” 

He followed the hurrying dip and 
stately rise of the suspension cable 
as it swung above his head. His 
neck rested on the yielding ridge 
of the seat’s back. 

“I look at the moon,” he said 
lightly. “I count the stars and smell 
the night. I drink Tom Collinses 
in a cellar bar off Sheridan Square. 
I am a windblown autumn leaf, 
now tumbling through the air, now 
spinning groundward, now resting 
on the frost-touched grass, and 
when the other leaves fall and cover 
me — when the rains of September 
have packed and trampled me into 
the tough layer of the other crushed 
leaves — I shall lie supine and wait 
for the blessedly concealing blanket 

THE STRANGERS 



of the snow to hide me, to dissolve 
me, to put me back in the earth 
whence I am sprung.” 

She giggled happily and wrinkled 
her nose. “When you’re not being 
stupid, what do you do?” 

He raised an admonishing finger. 
“Ah, Giulia, it is when I am truly 
stupid that I do anything else. 
Truly. It is when I send to ask for 
whom the bell tolls that I am mere- 
ly a jobless senior clerk in a bank, 
only recently holding the purse- 
strings of a thousand — nay, a hun- 
dred thousand — in my impover- 
ished fingers. Are you a good com- 
mercial artist?” 

She nodded in rapid, self-deriding 
affirmation. “Oh, very good.” She 
turned the car off the bridge and 
into the West Side Highway. 
“Where have we been?” she asked 
breathlessly. 

“We have,” he ticked off on his 
upraised fingers, “driven up Fifth 
Avenue in a midsummer night’s de- 
lirium. We have circumnavigated 
Central Park and then, having be- 
come bored with the Imperial City, 
we have been to Bear Mountain, 
thence to such places as Nyack, 
sans kayak; we have flirted briefly 
with an edge of New Jersey, and 
we have crossed our bridges when 
we came to them. The Isist one, as 
I recall, was dedicated to someone 
named Hamilton or Jefferson or 
Something, but we, in our bubble- 
headed daring, nevertheless made 
use of it. And that tinkling sound to 
the east is the break of dawn.” 

He clasped his hands behind his 
head and sighed. “And we have 
spoke of many things. Of cabbages, 
lungs, and the New York Giants, 



17 




who, we have solemnly decided, 
are due to make a rousing finish of 
it, after starting off in their usual 
miserable slump. If the pitching 
holds up.” 

“I have to go home,” Giulia said. 

“I know.” The cold dawn breeze 
touched him. 

Giulia stopped the car in front of 
his house and rested her head 
against the back of the seat, her eyes 
losing their sparkle. 

“This was fun,” she said wist- 
fully. 

He nodded silently. 

“I wish this whole world would 
go away!” she said with sudden ve- 
hemence. “I wish things were al- 
ways like last night.” Then the 
mood left her as unexpectedly as it 
had come. “Which is classifiable un- 
der the heading of escapism,” she 
said wryly. “Onward, Spencer, ever 
onward. Wheels must turn, pumps 
must pump, etceteras must etcetera. 
Send not to ask for whom the bill 
tolls.” 

He got out of the car reluctantly, 
and stood beside it, his hands on the 
window coaming. 

“Fd like to see you tonight, Giu- 
lia.” 

“Fd like to see you.” She smiled 
gently. “Don’t mind me. It’s a 
shock, like dropping back off a 
cloud.” 

“I know. I just bounced off the 
same one.” 

“Well, let’s keep a few wisps 
around, just to remind us.” 

He shook his head in mild amaze- 
ment. “Do you realize how much 
we had to talk about, and didn’t? 
There’s Mr. Laban and the whole 



business of how we happened to 
meet . .” 

“I know.” Her eyes darkened, 
and something frightened took hold 
of her lips. “I’m glad we didn’t. 
That’s for later — for much later. I 
haven’t seen Mr. Laban since I — ” 
Something dark and troubled 
crossed her face, and she stopped, 
her nail-bitten fingers tightening on 
his hand. “Much later,” she said 
softly. 

“All right,” he said lightly. He 
would not have pressed the point 
any farther for the world. “I’ll call 
you.” 

She smiled again. “I’ll be home 
most of the afternoon. I may be out 
buying some dog food or something, 
but if I don’t answer. I’ll be back in 
a minute. 

“Whatever you do, don’t give 
up.” She put a kiss in the air for 
him before she started the car and 
drove away. He stood on the side- 
walk, looking after her. Of all the 
inexplicable things that had hap- 
pened to him since last night, she 
was the only one he wanted. 

Nevertheless, he waited until her 
car was out of sight before he began 
the twisted, ugly climb up the stairs 
to his door. He looked up into the 
doorway, and the graceful man was 
standing behind the glass, watch- 
ing every step. 

T he graceful man held 

the door open as Spencer 
reached the top step, his eyes film- 
ing with rage. 

The man put up a quick hand, 
palm out. “Wait, Mr. Spencer!” 
There was less assurance in his 



18 



ALGIS BUDRYS 




voice, this time. His lips were slack 
at the comers with the first hint of 
apprehension. “I didn’t think you’d 
want me to help you up the steps. 
On the other hand, here I was. A 
difficult position.” 

‘‘You’re right. What else have you 
got to say?” 

“Please listen to me!” 

Spencer narrowed his eyes. That 
last had been an unmistakable plea. 
His mouth twisted scornfully, and 
his fingers hooked. But the wave of 
shame and anger had broken with- 
in him. He’d be a fool not to pay 
some attention to the man. 

“Well?” 

“I — I’m willing to help you.” 

Spencer almost laughed. But 
there was too much of a change 
from the confident, almost super- 
human man of last night. The man 
was badly frightened of something. 
In that fright, he might say more 
than he intended. 

“Go ahead.” 

The graceful man licked at a cor- 
ner of his mouth. “Could we go up 
to your room?” 

Spencer thought it over for a 
moment. “No,” he said finally. “Not 
yet. Give me one good reason.” 

The graceful man clutched at his 
sleeve. “Listen,” he said urgently, 
“I’m not one of your enemies. I’m 
a third party. From outside. I’ll help 
you get your people out of this 
jam.” 

Suddenly, the memory of that last 
talk with Mr. Laban was very clear 
in Spencer’s mind. Enemies, Mr. 
Laban had said. And clashes on a 
level no Earthman could ever be 
aware of. 

Something prickled at the small 
THE STRANGERS 



of Spencer’s back, and the carefully 
acquired cynicism of six years was 
revealed to be a very feeble wall in- 
deed. 

The graceful man saw his hesita- 
tion. “Listen!” he exclaimed again, 
“I’m no fool! I can^t fight you now! 
I never suspected that Laban had 
arranged for you and the girl to 
meet. Can’t you see that? My whole 
plan was based on the assumption 
that he’d ^ven up after both of 
you were crippled. And so you were, 
individually. But as a team — ” 

Spencer shook his head, uncom- 
prehending. He was vastly tired. 
His shoulder muscles were scream- 
ing with the unbalanced load they’d 
been carrying too long without any 
rest. His mouth was fogged with 
last night’s alcohol, and the bright 
glare of the day was stabbing at his 
bloodshot eyes. 

“Go on,” he said, forcing the 
words through his stiff mouth. 
Much of what the man was saying 
was sheer gibberish. But some of it 
was clicking into place. The grace- 
ful man had his facts arranged in 
the wrong order, and some of them 
were not facts at all. But he was tell- 
ing Spencer what he wanted to 
know, nevertheless, 

“There isn’t any more. You can 
see I’m in no position to fight. All 
right, then I’ll help you. I’ve got to 
do something. You don’t pass over 
an opportunity like this. Not one 
like this.” 

Spencer frowned. The man was 
acting like a commission agent with 
an account slipping out of his grasp. 

“What’s your price?” Spencer de- 
manded. 

The man looked startled. “Sal- 

19 




vage rights, of course.” 

“On what?” 

The graceful man stared at him. 
“On what?” A slow realization 
came over his face. “You don't 
know!” He looked up at Spencer’s 
surprised face, inches away, and 
laughed. 

“You don’t know!” he repeated. 
“It was an accident! A true acci- 
dent! I’ve tricked myself!” 

Too late, Spencer shot out a hand 
to grab his jacket. The doormat 
skidded out from under his bad foot 
and he fell heavily. His head thud- 
ded against the cold tile of the 
foyer. The graceful man danced 
back, out of the reach of his grasp- 
ing hands. Then he sprang forward, 
hurdling Spencer’s body. “What a 
feeble excuse you are!” the graceful 
man said with something like in- 
credulity. “What a feeble excuse!” 

Spencer reached out desperately. 
But the mat skidded again, and he 
only slid helplessly to one side. He 
tried to get to his feet, but the mat 
slipped again. And once more. 

The graceful man chuckled. He 
half-danced down the steps. “I’ll be 
back!” he cried over his shoulder 
and walked briskly away down the 
sidewalk, his shoulders straight and 
his head up in the early morning 
sunshine. 

Slowly, Spencer managed to stand 
up. Completely numb, he staggered 
to the elevator and got up to his 
apartment. He stripped off his 
clothes with weak hands and fell 
across his bed. 

He was too close to panic to think 
now, he realized. 

Weapons he did not understand, 

20 



in a war he could not see. And the 
graceful man was after salvage 
rights. 

He had to get to a telephone and 
warn Giulia. 

He reached across the bed, his 
stiffly straight fingers reaching for 
the instrument. But his body had 
been too much abused. His finger- 
tips barely touched the smoothness 
of hard rubber as he fell asleep. 

Remember this: Any point in one 
space is adjacent to all points in any 
other. Here is instantaneous com^ 
munication and transportation. 

Spencer rolled in his sleep. 

Consider this: The stranded trav- 
eler must have hotel accommoda- 
tions. If these are unavailable, he 
must knock on the villager's door 
and beg a lodging for the night. 

Spencer pawed at his face in an- 
noyance and mumbled. 

Extrapolate from this: The lodg- 
ing is suited to the necessity of the 
lodger. One man's haystack is an- 
other's shelter. 

And if the weary travelers must 
stop where there are thieves, then 
they must set out alarms and choose 
sentries from among their numbers. 

Finally, Spencer awoke. He re- 
membered the dream, but if dreams 
were accepted as data, nightmares 
would be subject to censorship. 

H e did not know what he was 
going to say to Giulia. He 
came out of the subway entrance 
and hurried toward her apartment 
house. She had sounded cheerful 
and unworried over the phone, and 
he hadn’t mentioned the graceful 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




man. As long as she was safe and 
unafraid, he first of all wanted to 
find out what she knew about Mr. 
Laban — and what weapon had been 
used to strike her down. 

Suppose he did find out? What 
good would it do? What defenses 
could they raise against the shad- 
owy legions that waited just behind 
their shoulders? 

“Wes ten Hilyard Spencer, Aged 
24, Occupation : Melodramatist,” 
he thought wryly as he swung down 
the sidewalk. 

He smiled crookedly, his confused 
mood beginning to evaporate. Out 
of the subway and in the light of the 
cool, comfortable evening, he was 
rapidly snapping back to normal. 

He noticed with a slight shock 
that his limp was far less pro- 
nounced when his mind was busy 
with something else, and then he 
saw Giulia standing on her steps, 
waiting for him. 

She came down and linked her 
arm with his, her eyes shining and 
her lips parted not in last night’s 
wonder, but in anticipation. Some- 
thing warm touched his emotions. 

“Well, hello!” she said. 

He realized that he had been 
standing silently, simply looking at 
her, and flushed. “Hello.” 

They laughed together, his rue- 
ful chuckle mingling with the 
bright river of her voice. “Whith- 
er?” she asked. 

Catching her mood, he pursed his 
lips and cocked his head. “Oh, any- 
where. Cost is no object.” 

She grinned. ^"Ah-huh! My job- 
less poet. Shall we order our car 
and tour some more?” 

“All right!” They laughed again. 

THE STRANGERS 



Her car was parked a few yards 
up the street. They climbed in, and 
she pulled away from the curb with 
a growl of the motor. Spencer no- 
ticed it. Yesterday, it had been a 
faint whispering, as gentle as — well, 
yes, as gentle as Giulia, just as to- 
day it was in perfect keeping with 
her more intense mood. “I say 
again, lad — whither?” She was 
finding something to respond to in 
the car’s decisive progress. He could 
see she enjoyed driving; liked the 
snap of wrists that sent the roadster 
around a corner with a precise 
swing of the tires. Yesterday, the 
car had drifted around the turns. 
Today it forged through them. 

“Long Island, maybe?” 

“Righto!” She shot the car across 
town, weaving skillfully through 
traffic. The motor idled threaten- 
ingly at stop lights, the car jumping 
ahead of all others as the lights 
changed. The tires sang waspishly 
along East River Drive. 

“Smoke me.” 

“Huh?” He looked at her un- 
comprehendingly. 

“A cigarette. A butt. Smoke me, 
boy, smoke me!” Her fingers 
snapped out a rapid beat to the 
words. 

“Oh. Sure.” He lit two cigarettes 
and put one between her lips. 
“Hussy.” She hadn’t smoked last 
night — ^he remembered, guiltily, 
that he’d never offered her a ciga- 
rette. In her mood then, she must 
have been too shy to ask. 

“Hussy I be,” she agreed, swing- 
ing the car onto the Triboro Bridge. 
“For tonight, I be a hussy.” And 
something laughed in her shining 
eyes. 



21 




The road was narrow, a head- 
lighted tunnel in the dark. She 
drove slowly now, while the breeze 
whispered through the shrubbery 
that grew close to either side of 
them. 

“Feel like stopping for a little 
chat?” she asked him with a lazy 
turn of her head. 

He nodded. “All right.” 

Her hand moved to the dash- 
board, and the lights switched off. 
The night fell in a murky road- 
block. Giulia cut her speed to almost 
nothing, bent over the wheel, and 
peered ahead. “Yuh, yuh, yuh,” 
she checked off under her breath, 
her glance darting over the almost 
invisible bushes beside them. 
“Fw/i.'” 

She spun the wheel suddenly, 
and the car, sweeping branches 
cracklingly aside, nosed off the road 
and into a gap in the shrubbery. 
She ran the car forward until a 
screen of branches closed behind 

them, and then cut the motor. “By 
God, I can find it in the dark!” she 
breathed to herself. 

Spencer handed her a fresh ciga- 
rette, all his muscles completely re- 
laxed. Last night had not been a 
time for talking. But tonight’s was 
a different Giulia. For the first time 
in six years, he did not feel alone. 
For the first time since the graceful 
man had spoken to him in the bar, 
he did not feel bewildered and 
afraid. 

Their childhoods had been much 
alike. For as long as she could re- 
member, Mr. Laban had been 
coming to her parents’ home. And 

then, suddenly, six years ago, some- 

22 



thing had struck out and crippled 
her. Not physically. But so viciously 
that Spencer did not pry for the de- 
tails she was obviously reluctant to 
give. And, at the same time, her 
parents had died. 

“Heart attacks?” Spencer asked 
bitterly. 

She nodded silently. 

“And right after that, Mr. Laban 
dropped you,” he said. 

She nodded again. “Just like 
that.” She shrugged and fell silent 
again. 

“Did you ever find out what he 
was training us for?” He asked it 
only after considerable hesitation. 
If she said no, that was the end. 
Then there was nothing left to do 
but crouch in the depths of the 
blind alley and listen to the foot- 
steps drawing closer in the night. 

“I’m— I’m not sure.” 

The long-held breath sighed out 
of Spencei^s lungs. 

“It’s something about some peo- 
ple — well, not people, but that’ll do, 
I guess — who were trapped here on 
Earth a long time ago. They were 
traveling through space.” 

She shook her head at the in- 
adequacy of her understanding. 
“Not in ships, though. It’s — ^it’s 
hard to understand. Mr. Laban said 
it was as though our universe was 
like a tunnel connecting two cities. 
These . people . were in the 
tunnel when something happened. 
Something blocked the ends of the 
tunnel. And all those people have to 
wait until somebody digs them 
out.” 

“Until someone digs them out! 
How long have they been here?” 

She shook her head again. “I 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




don't know. But Mr. Laban once 
said something that made me won- 
der if it wasn’t since before there 
were people — I mean people like 
us.” 

Spencer stubbed his cigarette out 
and looked into the night that had 
been falling since the Earth began 
to turn, four billion years in the 
past. 

“What was our job?” he asked in 
a voice that trailed off into a husky 
whisper. 

Giulia stirred restlessly on her 
half of the seat. “I don’t know,” 
she said. “It had something to do 
with those people. That’s all I 
know.” Something in her voice 
caught his attention. He looked 
more closely and realized she was 
crying. 

“GiuUa!” 

She reached out for him, her face 
against his shoulder. “Wes! Wes! 
It’s been so lonely!” 

The car snarled back toward 
Manhattan. Spencer was driving, 
his eyes tight, lus responses over-fast 
and harsh, while Giulia curled lux- 
uriously on the seat beside him, her 
head in his lap. One hand traced 
an intricate pattern on his thigh, 
and the breath flowed smoothly in 
and out of her relaxed body. 

Sweet Giulia! he thought. Gentle 
Giulia! Yes, you can find that 
shrub-locked hideaway in the dark. 
I would trust you to find it from 
anywhere on the Eastern Seaboard, 
on the darkest night in the dirtiest 
storm that ever brewed in hell. I’d 
stake my life on your proficiency. 

“Smoke me, boy,” she murmur^ 
from his lap. 

THE STRANGERS 



Smoke you! Fd like to set the fires 
of hell to roasting you! But he put 
the cigarette between her lips gently 
enough. 

He eased the car to the curb in 
front of Giulia’s house. “We’re 
here,” he said. 

Giulia stirred in his lap. “We’re 
here because we’re here because 
. .” she sang softly. She reached 
up and pulled his lips down to hers. 
Her nails touched the nape of his 
neck in a slow movement. 

“Gall me tomorrow, boy?” 

“Sure,” he lied out of harsh bit- 
terness. 

“Ah? What’s eating you, lad?” 

“Nothing’s eat — ” A ball of ice 
exploded in his stomach. His hand 
shot up and grasped her suddenly 
tense wrist. 

“You’ve got awfully long nails. 
Grandma,” he said viciously. 
“Quick— where did you meet me 
last night?” 

The girl chuckled and lifted her 
head. “I could answer that. But it 
wouldn’t prove anything.” The 
laughing torrent leaped and rippled 
under the tone of her voice. “Be 
damned if I was going to chop my 
fingernails.” 

His hand crushed her wrist as his 
jaw set into a harsh, strained line 
broken by the jut of the muscles 
that clamped it. “Let’s have it!” 

“Relax, lad. It wasn’t that bad.” 

“You wouldn’t know.” 

She arched her eyebrows and 
pouted carelessly. “I’m Giulia’s 
twin sister,” she said. “Tina. It’s 
a shorter name — easier to say over 
a phone.” 

“Not if you want Giulia,” he 



23 




snarled. “I’ll know, next time.” He 
let go of her wrist and flung open 
the door on his side. He pushed 
himself out, taking the full shock of 
his weight on his bad hip, glad of 
the pain that welled up to distract 
his rage. 

Tina grinned up at him. “You 
may not care, next time.” Her eyes 
glinted with light reflected from a 
storefront sign, which was red. 

“I’ll care.” 

Tina shrugged. 

“Will you tell me why?” he asked 
out of the depth of anger. 

Tina chuckled and winked at 
him. “I like you. Generally speak- 
ing, I like all of Giulia’s men. You 
sounded mighty cute over the 
phone.” 

He clutched her shoulder. “Cut 
it out!” he said from deep in his 
throat. “Quit playing games. Why’d 
you go through this rigamarole with 
me?” 

For just a moment, the folds of 
Tina’s garish mask parted. “We 
were curious as to just how much 
you knew.” Then she was laughing 
again. “So long, sonny,” she chuck- 
led. “I’ll make a point of telling 
Giulia what a nice date you are.” 

He turned away, his mouth curl- 
ing sourly, and dragged his leg up 
the street toward die subway en- 
trance. 



H e paid no attention to the 
placement of his foot or the 
twist of his body as he made his 
way from the subway exit to his 
apartment house. 

Weapons, he thought in bitter 
despair. What kills a man more 



surely — a bullet through the head or 
a stab through the heart? 

And they stabbed deep, some- 
times, he suddenly recalled. 

Tina had dangled bait in front 
of him, telling him just enough to 
pull information from him if he 
had it, not enough to help him if 
he didn’t. 

What had happened to Giulia? 

Why hadn’t he thought of that 
while he was there, in front of her 
house? Why had he turned away, 
instead of running upstairs? 

Was that a weapon, too— as were 
doormats that suddenly lost all hold 
on a floor? 

He had to get in touch with 
Giulia. 

His key fumbled in the lock, and 
he swung the door open with a 
thud of his shoulder. Hitching his 
body forward in clumsy surges, he 
made for the telephone. 

“Hello,” the graceful man said, 
“I just came in myself.” 

Spencer stopped dead. He pulled 
in a deep breath and let it sigh out 
again. Turning around, he went 
back and closed the door. 

“Have a seat,” he said dully. 

“Thank you.” The graceful man 
sank down into a chair and crossed 
his ankles. 

Spencer sighed again. “I don’t 
think I care anymore,” he said, “but 
how’d you get in here?” 

“All points in one space are ad- 
jacent to any point in any other, re- 
member?” The graceful man 
chuckled. “But you don’t. Besides, 
it’s not quite true, or you people 
wouldn’t be here, would you? But 
you don’t know that, do you?” He 
laughed. 

24 




Spencer crossed the room and 
sat down, feeling the hopelessness 
wash all the resistance out of his 
muscles. They were always four 
steps ahead of him, always laugh- 
ing. Walls meant nothing to them 
— space and time were something 
to move through. 

Mr. Laban had warned him. 
“All right, stop rubbing it in,” he 
said, surprising himself with the 
peevishness in his voice. “Do what- 
ever you came here for.” 

“That was quite a little hornet’s 
nest you and the girl stirred up,” 
the graceful man said conversa- 
tionally. “You fooled me. You also 
fooled your enemies. Temporarily, 
of course, but my! what a scurry- 
ing about there was. Simply because 
you accidentally ran into each oth- 
er.” He shook his head in wonder. 
“Get on with it.” 

The graceful man smiled fleet- 
ingly. “Now, then — ^your little 
contretemps with, ah, Tina . .” 
“How’d you find out about that?” 
The graceful man smiled again. 
“My, you’re always asking that, 
aren’t you?” he mused. “You 
wouldn’t know.” He chuckled 
quiedy. 

“At any rate, there’s proof that 
you’ve aroused the opposition, so to 
speak. They can’t quite fathom 
what you’re up to — ^which is un- 
derstandable, since you don’t realize 
yourself — ^but they are aroused. 
This is something I am not too 
happy to see. If they blunder across 
my own operation, they’ll give me 
trouble.” 

He hitched himself forward in the 
chair. “I’m very sorry, Mr. Spencer, 
but I’m afraid we’ve come to a 

26 



parting of the ways.” He stood up 
and extended his hand. “I certain- 
ly hope you’ll bear no lasting 
grudge.” 

Spencer pushed himself up and 
reached out to take the hand. The 
graceful man was still not making 
any sense, but it hardly mattered 
any more. 

The graceful man smiled. “I 
find it interesting that the most 
dangerous thing one can do to you 
people is to kill you before you’re 
ready.” 

His fingers closed around Spen- 
cer’s. “Ordinarily I’d have my res- 
ervations about you. But with suc- 
cess so near, it hardly matters if 
you’re free to transfer to a healthy 
chrysalis or not . .” 

Spencer realized he was shaking 
hands with Death. 

And the things Mr. Laban had 
taught and told him — the little 
hints, the recommended studies, the 
inexplicable incidents — ^were sud- 
denly organized. In the blink of a 
second, there was a pattern where 
none had been before. 

And something that had always 
been in his mind, straining at the 
jammed door Mr. Laban had par- 
tially opened, extended a paw 
through the narrow crack. Razor- 
keen claws clicked open. 

The graceful man stopped as 
though something had been dashed 
in his face. His eyes glittered coldly. 
“What did you do?” he asked in a 
faint voice. 

The hopelessness and confusion 
began to melt out of Spencer’s 
mind. The new thing, partial and 
tenuous as it was, began to take its 
place. He could feel it moving, sense 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




the flexure of its muscles. 

He had horn double^taamcd once 
too often, and this time the boy 
had jarred away from the man. 

‘^Salvage, eh?” He held the 
graceful man transfixed on his piti- 
less gaze and got back to his chair. 
He twitched the paw again, and 
the graceful man screamed thinly 
past the obstruction in his throat. 

“I can control this thing pretty 
well,” Spencer said as matter-of- 
factly as the graceful man at his 
best. “But I still don’t know why 
I’ve got it. Suppose you tell me.” 
He opened his — grip? — a fraction. 

“I — I can’t understand it,” the 
graceful man protested hoarsely. 
“There was nothing — ^nothing . 

“I believe you fall short of in- 
fallibility,” Spencer said dryly and 
flicked a talon at the pain centers 
responding to the man’s trigeminal 
nerve, “Sit down and stop wasting 
time.” 

The man — no longer poised or 
graceful — shook himself. He half- 
fell onto the couch, rubbing his 
throat. He sat looking down at the 
floor, his voice hopeless. 

“I’ve already said that all points 
in one space are ad — ” 

“And I already know that. Go 
on. 

“Very well. This is not simply a 
mathematical concept — ” 

“Obviously.” 

“ilH right! I don’t know how 
much you already know! Show 
some patience!” 

Spencer only smiled. 

“All right,” the graceful man re- 
sumed more quietly. “A party of 
travelers were trapped in this uni- 
verse. How long ago, on the local 

THE STRANGERS 



time scale, I couldn^t say. And I 
don’t know how it happened. Pos- 
sibly they chose a route that isn’t 
open very often, despite what the 
mathematics say. At any rate, what 
should have been an instantaneous 
passage became, instead, a voyage 
involving thousands of years on the 
local time scale. And as long as they 
were in this universe, they had to 
conform to its physical laws. They 
were long-lived, in these terms, but 
not that long-lived. They had to 
find shelters, somewhere — some 

means of staying alive until the 
route was open again. 

“You must understand that these 
were not physical beings. What the 
human race is trying to accomplish 
with physical devices, they do as 
easily as a human raises his arm. 

“I say ‘they do.’ What I mean, 
of course, is — we do.” 

Spencer looked at him silently. 
He tightened the clutch of his paw. 

“/’m not lyingr^ the graceful man 
screamed. 

“All right,” Spencer said, “You’re 
not lying. What’s all this mean in 
terms of you and myself?” 

“The travelers went into sus- 
pended animation. They went into 
chrysalis. They started with ani- 
mals, then switched to human be- 
ings when they evolved. I think 
some of them may have moved into 
the more complex plants. I don’t 
know. But I do know that at least 
every human being acts as a chry- 
salis for one of them. When the 
chrysalis dies, they move on to a 
fresh one. Automatically. Most of 
them are completely unaware of 
the passage of time. They’re just 
waiting.” 



27 




Spencer frowned, remembering 
his nightmare. The stranded travel- 
ers had crawled into some strange 
haystacks indeed! 

“Let’s get this cleared up,” he 
said. “First: there are other uni- 
verses besides this one. Other di- 
mensions, if you want to call them 
that. All these universes, including 
ours, are so arranged that any 
specific point in one touches all 
points in another. What the scien- 
tists call hyperspace — the thing they 
figure will allow us to eventually 
beat the speed-of-light barrier and 
reach other stars. Right?” 

The graceful man nodded. “If 
you know how to shift from universe 
to universe at will, you can start in 
this room, say, then drop into the 
next universe for a moment, and 
come out in Pittsburgh. Instantane- 
ously.” 

“Ah-AwA.' Except that something 
went wrong with this particular 
group of travelers.” 

The man nodded again. “Yes. 
What it was, I don’t know. The 
transfer isn’t mechanical — ^we don’t 
use spaceships or any other machin- 
ery. Maybe something went wrong 
in the brain of the individual actu- 
ally handling the transfer. I don’t 
know.” 

Spencer shrugged. “It doesn’t 
matter. Human — or inhuman — 
error isn’t something you can neg- 
lect, but it does happen. Now — let’s 
keep checking. This group of travel- 
ers got into this universe, but 
couldn’t get out. Not until certain 
factors shifted back into proper re- 
lationship. They took a wrong turn 
and got trapped in a blind canyon. 
They had to wait until something 

28 



— some natural process, analogous 
to a slow shift in geological strata — 
opened a new path for them. 
Right?” 

The graceful man rubbed his 
throat. “That’s right,” he said husk- 
ily. His eyes welled with slow hate 
for Spencer. 

“Three: These travelers had to 
find shelter. They did. They seeped 
into the bodies of living organisms 
on Earth. When evolution pro- 
duced people, they took over peo- 
ple. And when their host chrysalis 
dies, they just find another one. 
Just like rolling over in your sleep.” 

“Yes.” 

“That’s the biggest pack of lies 
I’ve ever heard from a sober man.” 
Spencer’s claw tightened ruthlessly. 

“Don’t! It’s true!” the graceful 
man screamed. “Listen — I’m not 
one of those people! This body was 
never born on Earth. I made it. I 
had to. I’ve got to conform to the 
physical laws of this universe. So 
did you. All of you. You had to 
find shelter, or you’d have died. 
But the chrysalids don’t know. They 
can’t feel you. They live out their 
lives normally — they have minds 
and feelings of their own. But 
they’re chrysalids, just the same. 
Each of them is the home of one of 
you. You’ve got to believe I’m not 
lying. Look inside yourself. You can 
do that — ^you’ve got special powers. 
You’re one of the ones whose job it 
is to watch over the safety of the 
others!” 

Spencer looked at him coldly. 
He couldn’t do that. The door in 
his mind was barely open. He only 
could half-sense the forces that 
lived behind it. 



ALGIS BUDRYS 




“Somebody has to be awake all 
the time,” the graceful man was 
babbling. “Somebody has to fight 
off the enemies.” 

“Ah. We’ve finally gotten to that. 
What about the enemies? Who are 
they?” 

The graceful man looked up 
wearily, and, had Spencer given 
him the chance, would have 
sneered. The faintest beginnings of 
stubbornness trembled at the sides 
of his lips. But the claw stabbed 
deep. 

“Look,” he said, “what kind of 
individuals will you find among 
any large group of Earthmen? All 
kinds — saints and sinners, philan- 
thropists and thieves. What makes 
you think other kinds of life are any 
different? 

“If you can stay awake, so can 
others. You’re a guardian. Others 
in the group saw a chance to do a 
little midnight thievery.” 

“All right — ^fine. But what can 
they possibly be after?” Spencer let 
the rest of his questions go for the 
moment. This was the important 
one. 

The graceful man stared at him. 
''What? Good Lord, man, don’t 
you know yet? Look — what kind 
of medium of exchange would ap- 
ply among people who don’t have 
material bodies — who have no use 
for promises on paper or tokens 
stamped out of metal? Personal ob- 
ligation, that’s what. Debt. And if 
you first get someone under your 
control — if you tie him up he and 
all his successive chrysalids are un- 
der your domination — ^if you en- 
slave his chrysalids, put them in 
uniform, make them worship some 

the strangers 



central ideal that keeps them from 
drifting away from you ... In other 
words, if you pen diem up in bar- 
riers of distinct race, and creed, 
and nationality — then they’re yours. 
Sure, the individual chrysalids grow 
old and die. But the young ones are 
still bom under your domination. 
If you set up that kind of system, 
and then, when the path re-opens, 
you're the one who wakes up the 
individuals your chrysalids shelter, 
and you're the one who shows them 
the open path — then they’re in your 
debt. 

“The catch is, Spencer, your ene- 
mies have to eliminate you before 
they can do that. Because if even 
one of you Watchers is awake and 
aware when the route opens, you 
can wake up all the others. And 
that’s your job. You people — you 
Watchers — were set up from the 
very beginning, to do just that.” 

Spencer looked at him narrowly. 
It just might be. Crazy as it was, it 
just might be. If it wasn’t, then how 
else could you explain the claw that 
squeezed the graceful man so ruth- 
lessly? 

“So I’m a Watcher, eh? Or, 
rather, I was trained to be a Watch- 
er. Giulia was, too. And Mr. Laban 
was a Watcher.” He smiled coldly 
at the graceful man. “And you’re 
in the salvage business. You found 
out our situation, somehow, and 
now you’re willing to tell us where 
the path is — ^for a percentage. Is 
that right? Is that right?" 

“Well, sure — you don’t expect a 
man to stumble over a setup like 
this and not take advantage of it, 
do you? Sure. I’m from the uni- 
verse you people left, all this time 



29 




ago. I found the other end of the 
route, and came in to see what the 
pickings were. And I ran right into 
this hassle you’re involved in.” 

“So the route’s open now, is it?” 
“Sure. What have I been telling 
you?” 

Spencer’s mouth crooked in dis- 
gust. “How do we stay awake? 
What do you mean by that?” 

The graceful man shook his head. 
“You don’t. But in every generation 
one of you wakes up for the balance 
of your chrysalid’s life. You can 
awaken others and train them to be 
your successors.” 

“And our enemies have a similar 
setup?” 

“Sure.” 

“Is that all?” 

“Isn’t it enough?” The graceful 
man shot him a bitter look. 

Spencer flexed the muscles of his 
power, and the graceful man reeled. 
“Don’t!” he shouted. “I’m a human 
being, just as though I was bom 
here. I feel with these nerves. I’m 
at the mercy of these organs. Stop 
hurting me!” 

Spencer laughed and let go. “All 
right, sonny,” he said coldly. “I’ll 
let you live. But when you get back 
to where you came from — remem- 
ber you owe your life to the indi- 
vidual who’s living in here with 
me.” 

The graceful man — the erstwhile 
graceful man — ^looked at him bitter- 
ly. “Magnanimous, aren’t you? You 
don’t even know what it means to be 
under obligation to someone else, do 
you? You wouldn’t be so free with 
your gifts if you knew.” He stared 
down at his ineffectual human 
hands, cursing. “A man tries to 

30 



make a little here and there, and the 
big-shots walk all over him.” He 
shot a look of pure hate at Spencer. 

Spencer gave himself time to 
laugh at him once more. Then he 
left the apartment, hurrying to get 
to Giulia. The last he saw of the 
graceful man was the broken, 
huddled figure on the couch. 

He limped out of the elevator as 
fast as he could, knowing that he 
might be on his way to disaster, not 
only for himself but for Giulia and 
all the other individuals he was 
meant to guard. For he was not 
Watcher Spencer. He was only 
Westen Spencer, cripple, with some 
understanding at last of what lay 
behind the jammed door in his 
mind, but with the door still tight- 
ly blocked. 



P erhaps the graceful man 
could come and go as he 
pleased. Spencer still could not — 
and he was growing gladder and 
gladder of it with every minute. 
Except for the latent power of that 
other individual within him, he 
wanted no part of their wonders. 

He hailed a cab, not caring about 
his money now, and sat tensely un- 
til they reached Giulia’s apartment 
house. 

Giulia’s and Tina’s. Spencer 
grimaced. Now he knew how 
Giulia had been crippled. But that 
could concern him no more now 
than did the fact that it was four 
o’clock in the morning. He ran 
twistingly up the steps. 

Don’t kill. Cripple. That was 
their technique. For if they killed 
the chrysalis before the individual 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




within had given up the fight, then 
they were only restoring fresh 
weapons to the warrior. But if they 
tied him down — ^if they walled him 
up in his own bitter prison . 

Giulia stood in the doorway. He 
stopped, looking at her, at the 
tracks tears had left on her face. 
“Gome in, Wes,’^ she said gently. 
Spencer stared at her. “How 
did you know I was coming?” 

“I knew. Please come in.” He 
stepped into the hall, and she 
leaned against him, the slow tears 
coming down her cheeks. “Wes, 
Wes, Wes,” she murmured, her 
trembling mouth just below his 
chin. “I knew you weren’t coming, 
but I kept hoping I was wrong. I 
sat in my room, and waited, and 
waited, and I knew you weren’t 
coming ...” The voice lost itself 
momentarily against his chest. She 
tilted her head back. “But I waited 
anyway. Until now.” 

He reached out and stroked the 
soft hair at the nape of her neck. 
“It’s all right, Giulia, I’m here 
now. And I’ve got a surprise for 
you.” He smiled as she looked up 
at him, the wonderful glow break- 
ing through behind her eyes. 

“A surprise? What is it?” 

He shook his head gently and 
kissed the tip of her nose. “Not 
now. Not down here. Can we go 
up to your room?” 

She smiled, her lips falling into 
the remembered lines. “Of course.” 
She put her arm around his waist, 
and walked up the stairs with him. 

He looked around as he stepped 
into her room. “You don’t know 
anybody named Tina, do you?” he 
asked. 



She looked at him uncertainly. 
“Tina? No, I don’t. Why?” 

He reached out and took her 
hand, with its ragged nails. “I 
didn’t think so. I’ll tell you about 
it, later.” 

“All right. Now tell me about 
the surprise.” 

He smiled into her deep eyes. 
“The surprise is something I am 
going to tell you about yourself, 
and about the world.” He sat down 
on the couch, and she curled beside 
him, her grave, astonished face 
looking up at him. His fingers laced 
in hers, he began to tell her. 

“ — and that’s why all these 
things have happened to us,” he 
finished. “And that’s why, though 
we’re not really awake yet — and if 
I don’t know why, I care less — 
we’ve got all these powers.” 

He felt her tremble, and stopped. 
“What’s the matter?” 

Giulia shook her head, and the 
slow tears began again, gathering 
in the comers of her upturned eyes 
and welling slowly down the sides 
of her cheeks. 

“I never understood before. I 
never knew. But now I can see it. 
I can understand why I sometimes 
do things without wanting to, why 
I know things when I shoiddn’t. 
Why did I go driving last night? 
Why did I stop under the arch for 
you? Can’t you see it, Wes? I’m a 
— 3. witch. Wes, I’m one of them.” 

He stared at her in agony. So 
that was what haxmted her! 

“No, darling, no,” he said. 
“You’re not a witch. There isn’t 
any such thing. And you’re not one 
of them. If you were, I wouldn’t

love you — I couldn’t. And you 
couldn’t love me.” 

The sound of the words hung in 
the air, and he found time to won- 
der what sort of wonderful feeling 
it could be that made him so sure. 
‘Tt was only because you’re so 
quick to feel things. It’s just some 
special ability of yours, half-awak- 
ened.” 

It was true, he thought. A sensi- 
tive enough human might tap into 
the powers of the individual he un- 
wittingly sheltered. 

But Giulia shook her head des- 
perately. “No; no, Wes. I never 
thought of it this way before, but 
when I first told Mr. Laban about 
it, he was frightened. He was con- 
cerned for me too, but he was more 
frightened. And — and it kept get- 
ting worse. I could hear what peo- 
ple around me were thinking — 
what men were thinking when they 
looked at me, and . and ...” 
She buried her face in her hands. 
“Not always,” she said past her 
wet fingers. “It would come and 
go. I began to see things — like 
people who weren’t people, who 
were only shadowy outlines with 
things inside them.” 

So that was it, he thought. That 
was how the Watchers knew what 
to watch for. A special sense that 
disregarded the chrysalis and saw 
only the sheltered individual with- 
in. 

“Most of the time the things 
were quiet,” Giulia went on. “As 
though they were asleep. But some- 
times they were terrible, and moved 
and did things . Wes!” 

He held her tightly. 

“And then • . then my — ^my 

32 



familiar followed me home, and 
the next time Mr. Laban came he 
just looked at me and went away. 
He never came back.” 

He would, Spencer thought sav- 
agely. No understanding of people. 
No caring. How had that long, 
ragged line of watchers ever man- 
aged not to break? How many had 
been little more than he, just hu- 
mans with partially awakened 
powers who somehow kept the tra- 
dition alive imtil another genuine 
watcher came awake and gave 
them all the impetus to carry on a 
bit farther? And how many had 
had the powers, and never known 
where they came from, or why? 

“Your familiar 

“A dog. A little black dog. It’s 
not a real familiar, of course.” She 
smiled faintly. “I’m not really a 
warty old crone with a cauldron 
of spells. But I’ve had a little black 
dog for the last six years.” 

He felt his muscles tense. Never 
once had the graceful man said that 
all the present chrysalids were hu- 
man. 

And he’d had an artificial hu- 
man chrysalis, created at will. If he 
could do that . 

A dog, he thought. A little black 
dog. 

“Where is your dog?” he asked, 
his throat dry. 

“Asleep in the other room.” 

“Call it!” 

“All right,” she said, wondering. 
She turned toward the open door- 
way to the other room. “Here, 
Princess. Come here,” she called 
softly. 

Printr^jj, he thought, and with 
complete expectancy, watched Tina 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




come through the doorway. 

“Oh!” Giulia’s hand shot up to 
cover her mouth, and she crouched 
against Spencer, completely white. 

“Hi, boy,” Tina said. 

Spencer smiled — a tired, sardonic 
grimace. “Giulia, darling, I want 
you to meet one of our enemies,” 
he said bitterly. 

“But she looks like me!” 

“I know,” Spencer said, his face 
tired, and older than it ever had 
been. “You’ve been listening, 
haven’t you, Tina?” 

Something was growing inside 
him. 

“To every golden word, lad. Do 
me something.” 

“Has it done you any good?” 

And still growing. 

Tina shrugged. “Some. Not 
much. But I’ve always had a small 
jump on you two pigeons.” She 
laughed. “Both of you all tied in 
knots the way you are.” 

It was almost grown. 

“That’s not true anymore,” 
Spencer said. He felt the alien rage 
gathering itself within him. 

“You’re Princess?” Giulia asked 
in a strange voice. Spencer looked 
at her, and her face was set into 
an expression he would not have 
recognized if it had not been grow- 
ing on his own. 

“Yep,” Tina said. But her eyes 
were suddenly too white, and she 
was staring at both of them. 

“Then I’m a Watcher,” Giulia 
said. 

Maim the stinking Insurgent, 
Watcher Spencer thought. 

Tina lifted one side of her upper 
lip, and the bright canine shone 
stark white in the lamplight. 

THE STRANGERS 



Suddenly, Giulia cried out. She 
folded her hands over her stomach, 
and the corners of her lips went 
pale. 

Watcher Spencer struck out at 
the Insurgent’s chrysalis, trying to 
drive past it at the entity within. 

“No, Watcher!” Giulia cried out 
in her terrible Watcher voice. 
“She’s mine!” 

Tina suddenly clutched her 
throat. 

Spencer sat imprisoned in his 
own body, watching the Watchers. 
So this is what it^s like to be a 
Watcher, he thought with that part 
of his mind that the battling Titan 
had left him. Waiting, and waiting, 
with the terrible patience of ter- 
rible rage, and then pouncing! 
Pouncing with such Wagnerian in- 
tensity! He laughed silently in the 
crannies of his leased brain. 

And still the battle went on. 

Then, Tina sobbed. Spencer .saw 
her suddenly double up, and heard 
Watcher Giulia’s vengeful laugh. 
And then he saw Tina’s dress be- 
gin to dance across her hips. 

Spencer laughed and laughed, 
while the two Watchers applied 
their wratiiful punishment, oblivi- 
ous, in their entities of pure elec- 
trons and gulf-spanning minds, to 
the ridiculousness of what was hap- 
pening. 

Heaven only knew what was 
happening to the Insurgent as an 
entity. But Tina, the chrysalis, was 
being spanked. 

And that was Giulia’s doing. Not 
Watcher Giulia — she, or it, was too 
preoccupied with her relentless at- 
tack on the entity within the chrys- 
alis, too cold and ruthless ever to 



33 




understand any sort of laughter but 
that of superhuman triumph. No 
it was Giulia herself — human Giu- 
lia, gentle Giulia — who took her 
human revenge on human Tina. 

Armageddon! Spencer thought. 
This is Armageddon! He rocked 
with silent laughter, and Giulia, 
too, was laughing. And Tina 
squealed and yapped. 

Human Tina? Oh, no — ^for 
Tina’s artificial chrysalis was shift- 
ing, melted under the fury of the 
simultaneous Watcher attack. Sud- 
denly the illusion of human flesh 
and human form was gone — and a 
little black puppy yipped frantical- 
ly, clawing at tihe slightly open front 
door. Then the door pushed farther 
open, and the little black puppy 
tumbled outside and fled down the 
stairs, leaving a diminishing sound 
of panicked yipping behind it. 

Awake! Arise! 

Watcher Spencer, his superhu- 
man mind linked with Watcher 
Giulia’s, hurled out his ponderous 
summons. 

It hurtled around the Earth, 
touching seas and mountains, rocks 
and swamps, lakes and beaches, 
and the places of Man. 

Awake! 

In their chrysalids, the sleepers 
heard it. Heard it as they slept in 
men, in bats, in wolves, in foxes. 
And, somewhere, the graceful man 
heard it too, and slipped bitterly 
away from his artificial body, to 
await the coming of that individual 



who called himself, for now. 
Watcher Spencer. 

And the impalpable, invisible, 
weightless horde rose up, completed 
its journey, and was gone at last. 

Spencer looked at Giulia. Of all 
the former chrysalids, only they felt 
the weight slipping away. The rest 
of the human race just went on liv- 
ing. 

They looked at each other and 
smiled. 

“Well, thafs over,” Giulia said, 
and laughed. Her light fingers 
traced the line of Spencer’s jaw. 
“We’re not carrying the Watchers 
around with us any longer. We’re 
just us.” 

“That’s right. Just us. Just the 
human race and all the other living 
things the Earth has grown.” He 
touched the firm warmth of her 
neck. He shook his head. “They 
were such a God-damned desperate 
bunch! So solemn. So relentless.” 

“Wes?” 

“Yes, Giulia?” 

“Do you think the world’ll be 
any different now?” 

“You mean, no more wars or 
slavery, no more shying away from 
people because they don’t talk or 
dress or worship as we do? I don’t 
know. I’m just a normal human 
being, I guess, after all. I don’t 
much believe in utopias and pat 
solutions. But we might try going 
outside and giving a look. Maybe 
they’ve lowered taxes.” • • •

BRIGHT ISLANDS 



HEN THE two Creno-Doc- 
tors were gone, Miryam took 
the red capsule from under the 
base of the bedlamp and slipped 
it between her dry lips. 

Reason told her to swallow the 
capsule quickly, but instead she 
held it under her tongue, clinging, 
against her will, to the last few mo- 
ments of life. 

She knew she was being weak, 
that she was still seeking hope 
where there was no hope, and she 
prayed to the ancient God of the 
Ghetto that the gelatin coating 
would dissolve quickly. 

Pain interrupted the prayer, 
spreading like slow fire from deep 
within her young body, where the 
unwanted child of Genetics Center 



stirred so restlessly, so impatient to 
be born. 

The white walls of her Center 
room blurred in and out of focus. 
Shadows merged together in brief, 
uncertain patterns. Lights flickered 
where there were no lights, and the 
darkness was so intense it had a 
glare of its own. 

At the worst of the pain cycle, 
Miryam bit down on her imder lip 
until the flesh showed as white as 
her teeth. She fought off tempta- 
tion to crunch the capsule and put 
an end to all pain, all fear. 

No, she would not go that way. 
She would go in a moment of 
blinding clarity, knowing why, sa- 
voring the last bitter sweet second 
of her triumph.

With a subconscious gesture of had taught nursery school since es- 
femininity, Miryam brushed the caping from the Ghetto, 
dark, damp hair from her forehead, “Doesn’t look a bit like one of 
and wiped the perspiration from her kind,” another agent had said, 

her lips. putting his hand under her chin 

“Pretty little thing,” one of the and turning her face to the glare 

Geno-Service agents had called of his flashlight. “No wonder she 

her, when she was arrested last fall fooled the Psycho and Chemico 
in the Warsaw suburb where she squads. Lucky for us!” 



37 



“What’s the matter, little one?” 
the first agent had spoken again. 
“Didn’t you know we were com- 
ing? I thought all of you people 
were supposed to be telepaths. 
Or doesn’t it work when you’re 
asleep?” 

He flipped the covers off her 
trembling body and whistled. 

“Hands off!” the Geno-Sergeant 
had warned sharply. “She’s for 
Center!” 

Now the capsule under her 
tongue was moist and soft. Time 
fled on swift, fluttering wings. Soon 
the horror would be done. 

But the stubborn spark still 
glowed, and Miryam allowed her 
mind to drift down the long, shin- 
ing corridor to the room where the 
younger of the two Geno-Doctors 
was changing into a white coat. 
The older man, who wore the gold 
trefoil of Geno-Sar on his collar, 
tilted back in his chair. 

“She should be just about due,” 
he said cheerfully. 

“Yes, Sir,” replied the young 
doctor, sounding the proper note 
of deference for a man who com- 
muned daily with the political elite. 

“What do you think of her?” 

“Well, Sir, frankly — I was sur- 
prised — ” The young doctor twisted 
muscular arms to button the back 
of his jacket. He had but recently 
come from the Genetics Sanitarium 
on the Black Sea, and his face was 
tanned deep brown. “From read- 
ing the weekly reports of your 
staff, I didn’t know she was that — 
that young — ” 

Miryam trembled with a hope 
she dared not recognize, but it was 
crushed out of her by the Geno- 

38 



Sar’s booming voice. 

“Not only one of the youngest — 
but one of the very best specimens 
we’ve had to work with at Center! 
You read her psi rating?” 

“Yes, Sir. Seventy-two point 
four, wasn’t it?” 

“Seventy- two point six! Abso- 
lutely phenomenal! Closest thing 
to a pure telepath our agents have 
ever turned up for us! This could 
be a big night for Center, my 
boy. A big night!” 

The young doctor shook his head 
to clear away the lingering image 
of a tragic, lovely face against a 
tear-stained pillow. Miryam was 
startled to find this image in his 
mind, and her pulse leaped again. 

In a carefully professional tone, 
the young doctor asked : 

“What was her rating after in- 
semination? Did the emotional 
shock. ?” 

“Not at all! Oh, naturally, jdie 
was uncooperative in the tests, but 
pentathol and our cross-references 
gave us a true picture!” 

“And the spermatozoa?” 

“Best we could get! Refrigerated 
about thirty years ago from a speci- 
men that tested forty-seven point 
eight.” 

The Geno-Sar paused, and be- 
cause a comment was obviously in 
order, the young doctor said: 
“This certainly could be a big 
night for Center!” 

The Geno-Sar snapped his ciga- 
rette lighter with an expansive 
flourish. 

“All the sciences have been tak- 
ing a crack at psi — ever since the 
last Politbureau directive gave it 
number one priority. You should 

FRANK RILEY 




have heard the talk at Sar-Bureau 
meeting this afternoon! The Math- 
Sar actually laughed at Genetics 
. told us to stick to our white 
mice!” 

The young doctor made a po- 
lite cluck of disapproval. 

“Those stupid mathematicians 
could learn something of heredity 
from their own ancients,” the 
Geno-Sar continued, growing 
heated. “Think of Liebnitz, gifted 
at 14 — Galois, a genius before he 
was 21!” 

The Geno-Sar recovered his tem- 
per, and winked. 

“Of course, I didn’t say that at 
the meeting — the Bureau chief is 
very partial to Math — but I did re- 
mind them, most pointedly, of the 
known data on inherited sensory 
differences between individuals. 
And you should have seen the 
squirming! Especially when I got 
into the taste studies and the 
phenyl-thio-carbamide tests! Then, 
when I told of Genetics research on 
sense of time — sense of direction — 
sensitivity to pain, sound and smells 
— Well, the Chief was hanging on 
my every word! The Psycho-Sar 
became desperate to the point of 
rashness, and he jibed at me about 
our ancient master, Profim Lysen- 
ko.” The Geno-Sar’s head inclined 
slightly as he pronounced the name. 
“But the Chief himself gave the 
correct answer! He quoted from a 
Bureau directive which stated 
clearly that sensory characteristics, 
like any others, could well have 
been acquired in the first place, 
and then passed on through hered- 
ity! Oh, I tell you, it was a heart- 
warming afternoon!” 

BRIGHT ISLANDS 



The younger man had been pay- 
ing him only half attention. 

“It’s strange we should find some 
cases of psi among her people,” he 
mused. “When I was at the Uni- 
versity I always meant to study 
something about the — ” he hesi- 
tated and searched for the ap- 
proved term, “ — the specimen 
races, but I never had time. .” 

For an instant the Geno-Sar’s 
steel-blue eyes narrowed, and 
Miryam was shocked to find him 
appraising the young man for pos- 
sible heresy. She had always re- 
garded the scientific mind as some- 
thing remote, cold, but never as 
something that could commit a 
heresy. 

However, the Geno-Sar decided 
to table the subject. 

“Of course you didn’t!” he 
boomed. “You couldn’t have made 
such a splendid record without total 
specialization! Each to his own, 
that’s how science has prospered 
under the benevolence of our 
party!” He glanced up at the 
clock. “Well, aren’t we just about 
ready for this delivery?” 

M iryam drew back her mind. 

What a fool she was to go on 
seeking! 

The child resumed its inexo- 
rable turning within her swollen 
body, and she knew she could 
never give to the world a life con- 
ceived so terribly, so coldly, with- 
out love or passion or tenderness. 

Even in these final moments, 
with the gelatin melting under her 
tongue, Miryam shuddered with 
the remembered anguish of strug- 

39 




gling up from the depths of anaes- 
thesia to find herself bearing the 
seed of a child, from a faceless man 
who had died long ago. 

Often, during the carefully 
guarded months of pregnancy, she 
had wondered about that man, 
who he had been, how his talent 
had compared with hers. 

Miryam knew little about ge- 
netics, or any other science. The 
scientific mind had always fright- 
ened her, and she had feared to 
explore it. But she knew there was 
no truth to the folklore that psi 
was a characteristic of her people. 
She knew of only a few cases out- 
side her own family, although with- 
in her family it seemed to have 
been a characteristic that had re- 
curred frequently for many gener- 
ations. Her father had cautioned 
her about selecting a husband, and 
pleaded with her not to flee the 
Ghetto. 

For the past three days, since the 
nurse had momentarily left the 
cabinet at the end of the corridor 
unlocked and unguarded, Miryam 
had known that she need not be 
concerned about the success or 
failure of this terrible experiment. 
From the nurse’s mind she had 
plucked the essential facts about 
the potency of the red capsule. 
This knowledge, for all its loneli- 
ness, had been something to cher- 
ish, to press to her full breasts, as 
she would never hold that child of 
horror. 

Tears filled her eyes, squeezed in 
droplets between the closed lids. 
Tears because she was so alone. 
Tears of unbearable sadness and 
pity, for her people, for her youth 

40 



and her young body, for the 
warmth that would be eternally 
cold, for the unnatural child that 
squirmed and turned, and would 
never cry. 

In a last forlorn gesture, in a 
final seeking before the darkness 
closed, Miryam let her mind stray 
out of the white room, out of the 
marble magnificence of Center. She 
let her thoughts escape on the soft 
breeze of the early summer evening. 

How beautiful it was, even here 
in the city, amid the science build- 
ings that formed bright islands of 
light around the minarets and 
vaulted domes of Government 
Square. 

Even these awesome buildings 
were lovely in the purple dusk. 
Their windows were like scattered 
emeralds of light. 

How could there be so much 
beauty without compassion? So 
much knowledge without under- 
standing? So much human genius 
without humanity? 

And what a battering of thoughts 
in the mild air around the centers 
of science! What a discordance! 
What a tumult of theories, each of 
them nurtured within its own walls 
by the zealous Sars. 

There were the Departments of 
Chemistry and Physics. There was 
the glass-walled tower of Astron- 
omy! There was the Institute of 
Psychology, with all its many bu- 
reaus. And the new Electronics 
Building, alabaster even in the 
dusk. 

They were all there, extending 
in stately splendor along the main 
avenues, and along the park, where 
the gossamer mist was rising.

How intolerant were the thoughts 
they radiated! How sure! 

Electronics said : “Quite obvious- 
ly the answer to psi is in the elec- 
trical currents of the brain. Our 
newest electro-encephalograph has 
demonstrated. 

Chemistry said: “Solution to psi 
inevitably will be found in Ae 
chemical balance of the cells. 

Parapsychology said: “We must 
continue to ignore those who insist 
upon attributing physical proper- 
ties to a non-physicd characteris- 
tic. 

And underneath this learned 
babble, Miryam heard the moth- 
like whispering of her own people, 
starving in the Ghetto, or hidden 
throughout the city, disguised, fur- 
tive, tense. 

Her mind came close to Gov- 
ernment Square, and she cringed, 
as she had cringed all her young 
life. The somatics were unbearable. 
Hatred and fear, blind prejudice, 
jealousy, cunning, ceaseless intrigue 
and plotting, setting Sar against 
Sar, using Ae genius of each sci- 
ence, dividing and ruling. 

No, there was nothing left. No 
hope, no promise. This was the end 
of time. This was the night of the 
world. 

Withdrawing again, retreating 
into itself, Miryam’s mind brushed 
the fragment of a thought. It was a 
half-formed thought, more a grop- 
ing, more a question, than an idea. 
It was delicate, fragile, a wraith 
and a wisp. But it came to her as 
clear as the note from a silver bell. 

Startled, she hesitated in her 
withdrawal, and perceived the 
young Geno-Doctor in the corridor 

BRIGHT ISLANDS 



near her room. He had paxised by 
the casement window, and was star- 
ing out at the twinkling islands of 
light around Government Square. 

And as his gaze wandered mood- 
ily from Tech, to Psycho, to Chem- 
ico, to all the incandescent, ko- 
lated centers of genius, the idle 
speculation had formed. 

“Wouldn’t it be an unusual view 
if all those bright islands were con- 
nected by strings of light. ?” 

Once formed, the speculation 
had fanned the ember of a 
thought: 

“Wonder if psi will build those 
strings of lights?” 

Then the young doctor turned 
almost guiltily from the window to 
meet the Geno-Sar coming down 
the corridor. And he said with 
crisp efficiency, 

“Fll check out 12-A for de- 
livery.” 

“Good boy! I’ll go on up and 
check the staff. .” The Geno-Sar 
rubbed his hands together, and 
walked off, repeating nervously, 
“Two psi characteristics must be 
the answer — ^two psi — ” 

“Maybe they are,” the young 
doctor murmured softly. “Maybe 
they are. .” 



D elivery, Miryam thought. 

The life within her throbbed 
and prodded. There was an ebbing 
of pain for a moment, and in that 
moment she saw with the blinding 
clarity she had sought that this 
child of hers might bring new hope 
to the world. That psi ability might 
be the answer to many things for

YOUR TIME IS UP 



BY WALT SHELDON 

The Colonel was a career man; and knowing what would hap- 
pen within his lifetime promised to be an invaluable asset . 
But he had never heard of that ancient legend of Faust .

AT FIRST I thought it was just 
another wrong number. Well, 
it was, in a sense — but not the kind 
of wrong number I thought it was. 
The ringing signal burred against 
my ear in the usual way, then there 
was a click, and somebody said, 
“Office of Historical Research. 
Zon Twenty speaking.” 

“Oh. ’Scuse me,” I said. “I must 
have dialed wrong.” 

That was euphemism — mis- 
placed loyalty, maybe. I didn’t dial 
the wrong number, and I knew it. 
But high brass had installed a new 
automatic dialing system in the 
Pentagon as an economy measure, 
and it produced so many wrong 
numbers and entanglements that I 



think it actually must have cost 
more money in the long run than 
the old-fashioned live operator sys- 
tem — but then that shouldn’t sur- 
prise you if you’ve ever been con- 
nected with the military. 

I was about to hang up after my 
apology. The voice on the other 
end said: “Wait! Did you say — 
dialedr 
“Sure,” I said. 

“Then — ” and he seemed sur- 
prised, if not downright startled — 
“what kind of a phone are you 
speaking from?” 

“Huh?” I said. “What kind? 
The regular kind. Phone, desk, 
dial, M-1 — or whatever the Army 
calls it.” 



43 





This time his voice went off like 
a small bomb. “The Army?'* he 
said. 

“Sure,” I said. “What’s the mat- 
ter with the Army?” 

And thought : Navy or Air Force 
type, no doubt. Our allies. Have to 
put up with them in the Pentagon. 
Have to put up with a lot of things 
— even being Colonel Lawrence 
Boggs didn’t save you from a snafu 
dialling system. I thought: some- 
body is out to needle armchair col- 
onels this week. I’ll play around 
with it for a while, maybe find out 
who’s got the sense of humor. 

The voice said, “Look here, are 
you joking with me?” 

“Perish it,” I said. 

“But this talk about — about dial 
phones. About armies. Why, you 
sound like one of those historical 
tri-vids about the twentieth cen- 
tury!” 

I smiled, without too much hu- 
mor, shook my head at the phone, 
and said, “Look, fellow, come off 
it, will you? I haven’t got time to 
play games.” I hoped he wasn’t 
some general or equivalent rank in 
a pixie mood. 

“Wait!” he said. “Wait — ^please 
— don’t think off! Tell me, what 
year is it? Where you are, I mean.” 
“What year? It’s 1955, of 
course.” 

“Why,” he said, “this is remark- 
able!” 

“It is?” 

“Do you know what I think has 
happened? A quantum inversion.” 

“Beg pardon?” I said. 

“Karpo Sixteen predicted the 
possibility just the other day! Lis- 
ten, my friend, let me ask you just 



a few questions — ” 

Then the mechanical voice of 
the operator cut in. It wasn’t a real 
operator, of course, just a recorded 
voice, part of the new automatic 
system. These voices gave all the 
standard phrases and usually at the 
wrong time, the way the system was 
working. The worst of it was you 
couldn’t argue with them or curse 
them — at least you always felt a lit- 
tle foolish afterward if you did. 

The operator’s voice said, 
sorry. Your time is up!" 

“Now, wait!” said my communi- 
cant, his voice fading a little, “Don’t 
cut us off! Don’t think off yet!” 

Again: “7’m sorry. Your time is 

upr 

And after that a click, and after 
that silence. 

I jiggled the hook a few times. 
No result. I shrugged. I hung up 
and rearranged the papers on my 
desk and went back to work, for- 
getting for the moment the party 
I’d been trying to call in the first 
place. And forgetting the odd con- 
versation I had just had. No — not 
quite. Not quite forgetting it. 
Queerly, it clung to my mind. 
What had he said his name was? 
Zon Twenty. Sounded like that, 
anyway. Odd name. Of course I 
still thought it was a gag of some 
kind. Yet it bothered me. Zon’s 
manner, his tone of voice had been 
so convincing. What he had said 
suggested that in some queer way I 
had managed to place a telephone 
call into the future. But as a sane, 
normal, recently promoted colonel, 
I knew this was impossible. 

At lunch I was still thinking 
about it. I ate in the officers’ mess

on my floor and steered my tray 
through the line. I taw, among 
other acquaintances Major “Clip- 
per” Moskowitz at a far table, and 
remembered that he was a great 
science fan, always talking about 
rockets and reaching the moon, 
and that sort of thing — ^we had 
one argument about why a rocket 
works in a vacuum, such as space, 
and he hammered the table and 
drew diagrams and quoted New- 
ton, and I’m still not convinced. 
Anyway, I went over and sat next 
to Clipper. 

“ ’Lo, Larry. How’s it?” he said. 

“Routine,” I said. “Latest re- 
quest for overseas duty turned 
down. I’ll probably die in the Pen- 
tagon with my pencil still behind 
my ear.” 

We talked of such things for sev- 
eral minutes. 

“Clipper,” I said finally, “you’re 
the G.L.E. on this future science 
stuff—” 

“The what?” 

“Greatest Living Expert. Latest 
Pentagonese. Tell me, what do you 
think of the possibility of ever be- 
ing in touch with the future?” 

“You mean time travel?” 

“I guess that’s what you’d call 
it.” 

“Time travel is nonsense,” he 
said. “A logical absurdity. By defi- 
nition, time is a series of infinitesi- 
mally small moments in succession. 
Once a point in time is established, 
it can’t be changed, any more than 
energy can be destroyed.” 

“I didn’t say anything about 
changing anything. I was thinking 
about — well, talking with some- 
body in the future,’* 

YOUR TIME IS UP 



“Just as paradoxical,” he said, 
shrugging, and taking a huge bite 
of braised beef tongue. “If you go 
into the futme — or talk to the fu- 
ture— the future affects the change, 
through you. In other words, if 
you can’t go back into the past, 
neither can people from the fu- 
ture. And it’s inconceivable that 
such a thing wouldn’t make 
changes. Maybe only small ones, 
but they’d multiply in time. ^Thou 
canst not change a flower, without 
troubling of a star/ That’s Francis 
Thompson, You step on one spider 
today, and you affect the evolution 
of spiders, the ecology of all other 
things in the distant future. By a 
simple act like that you could de- 
stroy or create a whole species to 
come.” 

“My head swimmeth,” I said. 
“All I want to know is — 

He wasn’t even listening to me. 
He enjoyed spouting this kind of 
thing. “Of course, it’s theoretically 
possible for you to witness events 
out of the past, without being party 
to them. If, for instance, you could 
travel away from Earth at more 
than the speed of light, overtaking 
the light waves of an event — say, 
the Monitor and Merrimac 
fight-” 

“Or the Battle of Gettysburg,” I 
said, loyal to the core. 

“ — ^you could look back and see 
it happen. The futmre? I doubt it. 
Unless in some way time and space 
actually curve back upon them- 
selves, as some think. 

“Uh huh,” I said, and drank my 
coffee and finally left Clipper Mos- 
kowitz. 



45 




after that I did manage to for- 
J\get about Zon Twenty tem- 
porarily. It was a busy week. The 
draft quota had gone up, and Per- 
sonnel Planning had worked out 
new criteria for classification, and 
I had to study these to apply them 
to analysis. This won’t make much 
sense to you unless you’ve worked 
in a military headquarters yourself. 
I worked. I had a dim idea that if I 
worked hard enough ' somebody 
would favorably regard one of my 
requests to get sent overseas. 

I’ve got to explain something 
right here. I don’t want anybody 
to get the idea I’m a hero type — a 
professional volunteer. But I’m a 
career officer, and overseas duty is 
the quickest way to tactical unit 
command, which is important on 
the record. The lack of it has kept 
many a perfectly good colonel from 
getting his first star and making 
that final big step. 

So I worked hard, and of course, 
sent in another request for transfer, 
this time under the provisions of a 
different set of regulations. And I 
didn’t think about Zon Twenty 
again until about a week later, one 
afternoon, when the phone rang. 

“Personal Analysis. Colonel 
Bog-” 

He didn’t even let me finish. 
“Well! I’ve found you again! The 
man from the past!” 

“Oh, no,” I said. “Don’t tell me. 
Not Zon Twenty — ” 

“Yes, it’s I, of course! Seems 
we’ve had another lucky accident, 
and been connected again. I was 
despairing of it for a while. Now, 
for machine’s sake, don’t go away 
this time! I’ve got to talk to you!” 

46 



“It’s your dime,” I said. 
“Dime!” He pounced on it. 
“That was a monetary unit, when 
you had money, wasn’t it?” 

“Look, mister — ” 

“You haven’t guessed what’s 
happened, have you? We have it 
pretty well analyzed at this end. 
But we didn’t really suppose your 
technology would be equal to it 
back there.” 

“Look, just who are you, and 
where are you?” I said. 

“My name is Zon Twenty, as I 
told you. I’m an historical tech- 
nician in the Office of Ancient Re- 
search in Washington, the capital 
of the planet. Earth. I’m an Earth- 
man myself, of course. My job is 
to prepare studies of ancient civi- 
lizations such as yours — ” 

“Now, wait — what kind of a gag 
is this?” 

“A gag? Oh — that’s the ancient 
term for a joke. Good! I’ll make a 
note of that!” 

“Come on. Who is it? Did Clip- 
per Moskowitz put you up to this?” 
“Oh, dear,” said Zon Twenty, 
and I could hear his heavy sigh. “I 
was afraid you wouldn’t be able to 
grasp the situation. I’m going to 
have to offer proof, I suppose. 
Look here — exactly what date is it 
where you are?” 

“I told you. 1955.” 

“I mean what month and year?” 
“It’s August 23, 1955 — and I 
think you know that as well as I 
do.” 

“August 23d. Just a minute . 
we’ll make a quick tape on the 
cyb, here. Ah, yes, here we are. 
August 23d. All right. The nearest 
date of significance is September

1st. On the date twenty-one of your 
so-called nations reached — or 
should I say will reach — a new 
trade and tariff agreement in the 
U.N., and this will eventually lead 
directly to the free nation federa- 
tion in — ” 

sorry! Your time is up!^" 

It was that blasted recorded 
voice of the mechanical operator 
again. 

“Hey! Don’t cut us off!” I said. 
“Hello? Are you still with me? 
Look here — I’ll try to call back! 
It’s difficult, but I think I can!” 
said Zon Twenty. 

“/’m sorry! Your time is up!” 
And again the click, and silence. 
This time I didn’t forget Zon 
Twenty, neither quickly nor easily. 
If it was a gag, it was a beauty: 
crazy and elaborate, and the act- 
ing was superb. If it wasn’t a gag 
— ^well, I couldn’t yet quite believe 
that it wasn’t a gag. A week 
streamed by in a sea of paperwork. 
My latest overseas transfer request 
came back disapproved. Then, on 
the morning of September 2nd I 
opened the newspaper and saw the 
headline: 

TWENTY-ONE NATIONS REACH 
TRADE ACCORD IN U.N. 

I read the story. It was essential- 
ly what Zon had predicted — or re- 
membered — or whatever you want 
to call it. I was confused now. 

That day I didn’t work very 
well. I couldn’t concentrate. I am 
not a deep thinker, and have no 
illusions that I am. But one idea 
presented itself, starting as kind 
of hypnotic little glow in the bot- 
tom of my mind, and this grew 

YOUR TIME IS UP 



until I could scarcely think about 
anything else. 

Put it under the heading of 
temptation. Ask yourself if you 
would have been able to resist. Or 
just forget all the moral and ethical 
implications, and accept that I was 
tempted in this way. If I could be 
in touch with this Zon character — 
if he really was from the future, 
and an historical expert, at that — 
he could tell me all sorts of things 
that were going to happen. I could 
then either predict them or other- 
wise adjust my actions to fit them. 
I could go up so fast it would make 
Caesar’s career look like a misfit 
reservist’s. I could — 

Well, then I started justifying 
and rationalizing. I could do my 
country all sorts of good. I thought 
along those lines for a while, and 
presently even managed to con- 
vince myself that my original pur- 
pose had been altruistic all along. 

Of course I tried to get in touch 
with Zon Twenty again. Over and 
over again I dialed the number I 
had dialed the first time I had be- 
come connected with him by ap- 
parent accident. I dialed random 
numbers. I listened to a long and 
boring dissertation on permutation 
of numbers by Clipper Moskowitz 
in an effort to devise a system of 
hitting all possible combinations. 
There were an awful lot of possible 
combinations. 



M y phone rang again nearly 
ten days later. 

It was Zon. He said, “Oh, there 
you are! I’d about given up! Look 
— ^the quantum inversion is swing- 

47 




ing back to normal! This is the 
last time we’ll be able to talk! So 
we’ve got to make every moment 
count!” 

“Sure ” I said. “You bet. Only I 
don’t exactly get it. I don’t under- 
stand just how all this happens. If 
you’d explain — ” 

“That’s not important. Briefly, 
we use telepathic induction for 
message selection. That’s why I 
was startled when you mentioned 
the ancient dial phone. And of 
course we don’t have armies any 
more.” 

“Yes, but—” 

“Listen, Colonel — ^what was your 
name? Never mind. You can be 
most valuable to me in my re- 
search. You can supply details 
about your time that simply don’t 
exist any more — ” 

“Don’t exist? Don’t you have 
movies, recordings, magazines, all 
that stuff?” 

“Of course not. They were all 
destroyed in the Final War.” 
“The what?” 

“The FingJ War. You’ll hear 
about it soon enough. If you sur- 
vive, that is. Only three hundred 
thousand did, out of the entire 
population. They were the seed of 
our present civilization.” 

“Hey, now, wait a minute! What 
about this war? When was it? 
When’s it going to be, I mean?” 
“There’s no point in your ask- 
ing,” said Zon. “You can’t change 
it, you know. If you could change 
it, I wouldn’t be here. My world 
as I know it wouldn’t exist. The 
fact that my time does exist proves, 
therefore, you never changed it. 
Now, if you’ll just calm down — ” 

48 



“Calm down?” I shouted it 
across the centuries at him. “How 
can I? How would you feel? Look, 
this Final War, as you call it. Is it 
going to be soon? You can at least 
tell me that, can’t you?” 

“All right. Soon, as all time is 
reckoned. In your lifetime, I would 
say. Now, I suggest that you adjust 
yourself emotionally and accept 
what is inevitable. The best thing 
you can do is answer a few ques- 
tions I’ve prepared.” 

I took his advice. I calmed 
down. “Questions? Well, Mr. Zon, 
or whatever your name is. I’ll tell 
you what I’ll do. I’ll make a bar- 
gain with you. I’ll answer your 
questions if you’ll answer mine. I’ll 
tell you what’s happening here — 
anything you want to know — ^if you 
look in that little file of yours and 
tell me what’s going to happen in 
my time. A dead?” 

He was silent for a moment, and 
at first I thought we’d been cut off 
again. 

“Hello? Zon? You still there?” 
“Yes, I’m still here.” His voice 
had become oddly quiet. “So it’s 
the old Faust legend all over again, 
is that it?” 

“I don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about,” I said. I didn’t — then. 
“You just answer my questions, 
and I’ll answer yours. Mine first.” 
“All right,” he said. “Very well.” 
And I started my barrage. When 
would the Final War start? He 
told me. How would it start? He 
told me that. Who would be the 
belligerents, and what weapons 
and techniques would be used at 
first, and what new ones would 
be developed? He knew. Where 

WALT SHELDON 




would the major campaigns be 
fought — ^how many troops would 
be involved? I got the whole story. 
I scribbled furiously and put it on 
paper. 

Afterwards, he asked his ques- 
tions. They were innocuous, com- 
pared to mine. He wanted to know 
about taboos and marriage customs 
and slang expressions and educa- 
tion and eating habits and articles 
of clothing. I told him. 

I was in the midst of an explana- 
tion of the game of Bingo, of all 
things, when there was a sudden 
whooshing and crackling in the 
earpiece of the telephone. 

“Hello? Zon? Still with me?” 

“Yes — ^but I think the signal’s 
going out. This may be the in- 
version passing! We probably won’t 
be able to talk again. Hello? Do 
you still hear?” 

“I do. Look — one more thing 
before we go. You said this dictator 
— the one everybody hated so 
much — survived the final series of 
blasts. He and his staff. Where 
were they? Where were they when 
the blasts came?” 

“In a country at that time called 
Canada. Little place named Reso- 
lution, on Great Slave Lake. They’d 
dug in there — ^very elaborate un- 
derground installation.” 

“And the date you gave me is 
correct?” 

“As far as I know. You’re de- 
termined to be in that place at 
that time, I suppose.” He seemed 
amused. 

“You can say that again,” I said. 

There were more rumblings of 
static on the line. 

“Well, since you’re so deter- 



mined,” said 2^n Twenty, “one 
more word of advice. The dictator 
and all his followers were after- 
wards imprisoned by what populace 
remained. Small wonder, since 
they were mainly responsible for 
all the carnage. It was a pretty hor- 
rible thing. They were slowly and 
most savagely tortured continuous- 
ly for nearly two decades. So if you 
mean to be there, at Great Slave 
Lake, I suggest you arrange to be 
on the right side.” 

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’ll ar- 
range it somehow. Larry Boggs is 
going to live through this, if any- 
body is — 

“What’s that? What’s that you 
said?” 

“I said I’m going to live through 
this — 

“No, no, the name. Boggs. Is 
that your name?” 

“Certainly that’s my name. 
Colonel Lawrence E. Boggs, United 
States Army, and — ” 

He was laughing. He was laugh- 
ing loudly, uproariously, and, I 
thought, hollowly. 

The background noise in the re- 
ceiver had been steadily getting 
worse. Now it swelled, like an an- 
gry sea. Interference of some sort 
snarled and crackled. A sick feel- 
ing began to grow like fungus in 
my stomach. 

Suddenly his voice came through 
again. He was still laughing. 
“Generalissimo Lawrence E. Boggs 
survived all right Colonel, he — ” 
All the noise cut away suddenly. 
There was a pinpoint of silence. 
Then the mechanical operator: 
“I’m sorry! Your time is up!”

coming semester was requested a 
week early. It looked very authen- 
tic. He handed it back. 

“So you’re going out on the 
Floor tonight anyway!” 

She stood up. “Yes. Thanks very 
much for the drinks, Mr. Talbot. I 
hope I haven’t bored you with all 
the talk about sociology. A space- 
man just in from Mars probably 
expects something more lively.” 
She blushed and turned rapidly 
away. 

Jim merely bowed his crew-cut 
head and smiled politely as she 
moved off. Then his eyes swept the 
room, a faint frown appearing on 
his forehead. There were a few 
tourists like the girl. There were a 
few spacemen, loud as usual, loud 
and noisy as their profession de- 
manded. And there were the men 
of the ocean, far too many of them, 
with their white, pasty faces and 
bloodshot eyes, their stony expres- 

52 



sions and their sudden, awkward 
motions as they forgot, temporarily, 
that they weren’t moving in one 
hundred feet of water. 

The men of the ocean weren’t 
drinking tonight. 

Jim’s frown deepened. He saw 
the uniformed figure of a copper 
from the Underwater Police, 
watching the room as he was, and 
recognized the reserve insignia. If 
the reserves were out, every single 
man on the Underwater Squad 
must be on duty tonight. 

A low, mournful whistle sounded. 
Last call for the Catalina Subma- 
rine. Suddenly it stopped, and for 
a second in ^e silence you could 
hear the boom of the breakers, the 
saddest sound in the world to Jim. 
Across the room he saw a sea- 
miner tip a signal to a kelp-cutter 
and he saw the cutter slide out of 
his chair, throw a coin on the table, 
and disappear into the fog behind 
the figure of the girl sociologist 
from Iowa. 

Uh-huh! 

Jim moved to the door, spoke to 
the reserve. 

“The boys are restless tonight.” 

The reserve looked at his space- 
man’s uniform in surprise. But then 
spacers were frontier men like 
Floormen and he nodded and 
spoke as insider to insider. 

“You said it. They’re all over 
the Bottom out there.” 

“For what?” 

“Old Man Cady’s come home,” 
said the reserve. “Three weeks ago 
they dragged him out of his kelp- 
beds and took him to Long Beach 
Memorial Hospital to die. But he 
said he’d come back to the Floor, 

R. E. BANKS 




and he did, and the Fbonnen 
think it’s great.” 

“The men of the ocean must be 
getting sentimental,” said Jim. 
“They weren’t in my day.” 

“You a Floorman?” the reserve 
asked in surprise. 

Jim grinned. “I was bom in 
Donovan’s kelp-patch,” he said. 
“But I got the hell out. It was too 
wet.” 

The reserve grinned at the old 
half-joke. “It’s wetter than water 
tonight,” he said, giving back a 
bromide. “If you’re thinking of a 
return visit, I wouldn’t go out 
there until tomorrow if I was you.” 

Jim didn’t answer. Instead he 
went out into the fog. In times of 
fog it was better, but you could still 
feel and smell and hear the city, 
the insane babble and crash and 
rush of it. The city that ran from 
Long Beach south to Old San 
Diego and north to Old San Fran- 
cisco. That ran inland through Los 
Angeles to the Sierras and over the 
mountains and across what used 
to be the plains. You could drive 
from the West Coast to Denver 
these days, they said, and never be 
out of sight of a man, building or 
advertising sign. Jim wouldn’t 
know because he didn’t like the 
land and its cities. There weren’t 
any cities in space — ^yet, nor under 
the ocean — yet. And that’s where 
you had to go if you wanted to 
escape this deafening twenty-four 
hour roar. Even with the men of 
the ocean having a ball for them- 
selves out on the Floor, it would be 
piore peaceful than the City, he 
thought. 

At the Submarine ticket window 



the girl from Iowa — Helen Lind- 
sey, wasn’t it? — was still arguing 
with an Underwater cop. 

“Lady, there’s a big celebration 
going on out there tonight, and 
when these guys cut loose it ain’t 
safe for inlanders. Like I told you, 
you can’t go out.” 

“At least let me buy a ticket to 
Catalina. The ride on the Sub- 
marine should be safe if I don’t get 
oflF.” 

The cop shrugged. But as she 
turned to the window the ticket 
man who had been selling tickets 
put up a sign SOLD OUT. 

Helen looked annoyed; then she 
turned and melted into the crowd. 
Near Jim a tourist spoke to his 
wife: “These crazy ocean people. 
They’ve been crowding the Sub- 
marine on every trip since six 
o’clock just riding back and forth, 
the man said. If we’re going to 
Catalina, we’d better take a sur- 
face boat or fly over.” 

The woman snorted. “I don’t see 
why they don’t build a bridge. It’s 
just an island, twenty miles out.” 



J IM shouldered his way through 
the crowd, keeping his eye on 
Helen. “I am very altruistic to- 
night,” he thought. “I’m sooo-oo 
altruistic.” 

As he expected, she pressed right 
up to the gate when it opened and 
flashed a bit of colored paper, 
probably a hotel check, and went 
right on through with the crowd. 
Once she got on the Submarine, 
she could always pay her way and 
one more never mattered. Prefty 
determined to be on that Sub, for 

53 



MEN OF THE OCEAN 




an innocent lady professor. 

Then Jim saw what he’d been 
expecting to see. The quick flash 
of a fish knife in the crowd. Those 
fish knives were apparently as 
sharp as ever, for the man sliced 
the handle of the girl’s bag as he 
jostled her and somebody else 
stepped on her toe and her purse 
was gone without her ever realiz- 
ing it. Jim recognized the face of 
the kelp-cutter from the tavern. 

He grinned. If you were caught 
on the Sub without either a ticket 
or money, they held you for the 
police at the other end. The men 
of the ocean were going to great 
pains to make sure that Helen 
Lindsey stayed on the Sub, but she 
didn’t have a ticket to begin with 
and he doubted that her money 
was in her purse. The men of the 
ocean would have to do better than 
that on this girl who was so anx- 
ious to join their celebration. 

Some celebration! 

Old Man Cady was dying out 
there tonight on the Floor and the 
men of the ocean were having a 
celebration to see that he died 
alone. That made sense when you 
considered that Old Cady owned 
three-fourths of the ocean floor be- 
tween the mainland and Catalina. 

Jim got on the Submarine too, 
using the fake ticket routine, and 
the busy guard passed him through. 
The locks slammed, bells jangled 
and the mighty vessel submerged, 
its squalid interior crammed with 
the soft-talking men of the sea, its 
grimy portholes flicking wizened 
lights out into the gloom of the 
Floor. Down below the pilot picked 

54 



up the Kelp-cutter’s Walkway and 
the propellers churned; the Sul> 
marine shook all over like an old 
lady with the ague and pushed 
through the water. Jim grinned to 
himself as he recognized the same 
furnishings of fifteen years ago, the 
same plush seats only a little more 
grimy today. 

It was too crowded to sit down. 
He stood at one end of the corridor 
near the Ladies Room and watched 
the underwater markers as they 
moved along. 

Meredith’s Mines — Buoy Office, 
Goldstein’s Kelp-farm, Entriken’s 
Mineral Buoy, Strong’s Mineral 
and Metal Supply, Rancho San 
Kelp, The Forks — 

He was expecting some action at 
The Forks, and he wasn’t disap- 
pointed. Helen got up to go to the 
Ladies Room. She pressed right by 
him without seeing him, because 
he leaned behind a miner. 

“Going to Catalina?” asked the 
miner, jostled into conversation. 

“Catalina Spaceport,” lied Jim. 
“Takeoff tomorrow.” 

“Most spacemen travel on top to 
to Catalina,” said the man accus- 
ingly. 

“I had a leftover ticket,” said 
Jim. “Excuse me.” 

He stepped in front of the 
“Ladies”. He was aware that he 
wasn’t the only one interested in 
Helen’s ploy, as he thought of it. 
Half of the Submarine eyed the 
door. Even the Conductor who had 
gotten half-way up the aisle, punch- 
ing tickets, called out ineffectually 
“Hey, lady, your ticket — ” 

Here the aisle was momentarily 

R. E. BANKS 




clear. The Submarine’s reputation 
for non-cleanliness assured Jim that 
Helen was in there alone. He put 
his shoulder to the door and waited 
for a lurch. He counted on the 
lurch. The ride was always jerky 
because the Third Mate always 
took over after the trip began so 
the pilot and engineer could enjoy 
their twenty-year old card game. 
Nothing had changed. Jim got his 
lurch. He broke through the door, 
because the fastenings were of the 
feeblest, as he well remembered. 

Helen had her diving suit on, all 
but the helmet. She had hooked it 
out of the bin marked Emergency. 
Her next step would’ve been to slip 
into the escape hatch. There were 
two things that were always first- 
rate on the Catalina Sub despite 
the rest of its faults. One was the 
diving suits, the other was the 
escape hatches. At least three times 
a year the Sub conked out and you 
had to go down to the Walkway 
and finish your trip under your own 
power. 

Helen looked at him in utter 
astonishment. Jim thought of the 
long reams oi explanations he 
would have to make and realized 
how little time he had, with every 
sea-man out there waiting to see 
what happened, and took a short- 
cut. 

He belted her on the cheek and 
then once in the solar plexis, be- 
cause unless you had practice in 
knocking people out, how could 
you be sure? 

She folded and slumped obedi- 
ently on the floor. 

He flipped her coat over her to 
hide the diving suit, cradled the 

MEN OF THE OCEAN 



helmet on her stomach and picked 
her up. He shouldered out of there 
just as the puffing Conductor broke 
through the last of the crowd. 

“Lady fainted,’” he threw over 
his shoulder and kept right on go- 
ing to the tiny door marked CREW 
—NO ADMITTANCE. 

“This is a helluva night,” groaned 
the Conductor. “Gad, she isn’t go- 
ing to have a baby, is she?” 

“This I doubt,” said Jim. 

He and the Conductor stood 
alone in the narrow walkway be- 
hind the Crew door, a catwalk that 
led to the Pilot’s compartment. 
Anxious white faces peered through 
the slit of glass, but the men of the 
ocean didn’t try to follow, figuring 
she’d be taken to the First Aid 
room. Jim carried her out of range 
of the door and laid her on the cat- 
walk above the pounding motors 
instead. 

He turned to the Conductor. 
“Here — I’m no doc. You take a 
look.” 

While the anxious old man bent 
to peer at the patient, Jim silently 
asked for forgiveness. Then he 
brought his heavy hand down hard 
across the exposed neck of the 
white-haired old man. It wasn’t 
too funny, he thought, as he 
dragged the old boy out of the way. 
Still, he had gained priceless mo- 
mentary solitude. They were out of 
range of vision of the men of the 
ocean and the Crew up ahead 
didn’t know there was trouble. 

Three steps down the corridor 
was another emergency locker. Jim 
grabbed a rubber suit from it and 
slid into the suit with the practice 

55 




of twenty years in space and under 
water. He flopped llie bowl helmet 
on his head, lifted Helen’s helmet 
off her stomach where he’d carried 
it and adjusted it on the now-writh- 
ing body. She was coming to now. 
Good. 

He picked her up, looked for the 
red light and found it. A dozen 
steps, half-dragging Helen and he 
was on the platform. He tripped 
the lever and the floor section can- 
tilevered around and dropped them 
in the tank. Ten seconds later, they 
were flushed out on the floor of 
the ocean. When it came to escape 
hatches the Crew had it all over the 
passengers on the Catalina Sub- 
marine. He watched the big metal 
fish ooze away from them in the 
water, its feeble port lights bravely 
dotting the darkness. What with 
this and that and the other thing, 
he had about ten minutes before 
the men of the ocean would know 
of their escape, and then the fun 
would really begin. 

Because tonight the men of the 
ocean weren’t letting any outsider 
within range of Old Man Cady. 
And the dark-haired girl wasn’t 
heading any place else, despite all 
the talk about Iowa, sociology and 
the other phoney baloney. While 
they were sinking to the Kelp-cut- 
ter’s Walkway, Jim wondered how 
many agents, male and female and 
children the Real Estate Founda- 
tion had sent out tonight and how 
many would get through to Cady 
to buy up the ocean floor before he 
died. 

Probably none, he thought as his 
feet touched the ooze of the Floor. 
Not even Helen. Not if he knew 



the men of the ocean. 



IM TALBOT was back in 
dreamworld. The equalizing 
pressures of the suit gave the body 
feel of normalcy even in a hundred 
feet of water, but the closed-in, 
drifting lightness was a stirring 
memory from the old days. Not the 
free lightness of space but an im- 
mersed lightness in which the sway- 
ing, deep currents took over and 
managed you. The silence was awe- 
inspiring after the roar of the con- 
tinuous city that was America and 
after the noisiness of space. 

Jim appreciated the quiet for a 
bit. Spacemen always shouted 
when they talked because what 
could be noisier than a spaceport? 
Spacemen shouted because even in 
the deep outside quiet of space 
they were enclosed in a noisy cap- 
sule where bells rang, a thousand 
large and small motors hummed 
and throbbed, burped and gurgled, 
depending on their health. Where 
cargo was always being banged 
around to make finer weight ad- 
justments, orders, news, music and 
time signals came whining out of 
the ship loud-speaker, men chat- 
tered and the maintenance crews 
banged their buckets and mop 
handles, and hustle and bustle were 
the antidotes for vast space soli- 
tude. 

This was a silence and darkness 
almost womb-like. This was a lazy 
giving over and slow movement in 
a ghost-world, where the dim light 
from the miner’s lamp in his helmet 
showed flashes of rock and kelp and 
the sandy floor, but where he was 

R. E. BANKS 



56 




sheltered and protected from the 
nerve-cutting hustle of civilization. 
This was one reason why the men 
of the ocean were different . 

Two phosphorescent steel cables 
moved slowly through the water 
just above the sandy floor, one 
eternally winding its way towards 
Catalina, the other to the main- 
land, like an underwater ski tow. 
Jim hooked onto one of the ties 
and fastened Helen’s belt hook to 
another. She struggled for a bit, 
then she became quiet and he 
figured her senses had fully re- 
turned. 

Every hundred yards or so along 
the Kelp-cutter’s Walkway there 
was a tiny dome. Jim set the hooks 
for “detach” and as they swept in- 
to the structure they were oozed 
off the line. He grabbed her flailing 
hand and sank to the upper floor of 
the dome, kicking the lock panel 
without even thinking. They were 
deposited rather crudely on the 
white, soft sand of the lower dome 
with a quantity of water which im- 
mediately drained away, and he 
took off his helmet and she hers. 

“Well!” she gasped. “I’ve been 
wooed and won before, but never 
quite like this.” 

“I saved you from arrest,” said 
Jim. He explained about her purse, 
watching her narrowly, but she 
kept up her role-playing, shrugging 
off her loss. She seemed more in- 
terested in the dome and studied 
it curiously, the black gashes of 
portholes and the institutionally in- 
adequate 25 watt light bulb in its 
no-steal wire cage. It was a com- 
fortable little bug-wallow with 
breathable air, ten feet across, rest- 

MEN OF THE OCEAN 



ing on the ocean floor. On one wall 
was a pay telephone. On the other 
a half-dozen motor propellers in 
racks. 

“Sorry about the rough stuff,” 
said Jim. 

“It was one way to get out on 
the Floor,” she said without hos- 
tility. In the tight rubber suit she 
looked little and lost. She drew up 
her knees and hugged them with 
her hands, staring at him with a 
bright-eyed look. 

“The only way,” said Jim. “You 
were smart enough to know that 
you didn’t dare get off at the regu- 
lar underwater stops without be- 
ing followed, but too dumb to know 
that the escape hatch routine at- 
tracts just as much attention. Now 
you can level with me. Why did 
you come out on the Floor tonight. 
Miss Not-from-Iowa?” 

The eyes remained bright and in- 
nocent. 

“Just to say I’d been on the 
Floor and walk around a little.” 

Jim got up without a word. He 
fumbled out his all-purpose credit 
card, fed it to a wall slot and re- 
moved two motor propellers from 
the racks by the hand-straps. He 
strapped one on himself and 
showed her how to adjust hers. 

“Come on. Miss Iowa.” 

She followed him to the lock, 
grinning through her bowl helmet 
at the embarrassing addition to her 
pert behind. 

“The subject of hundreds of dull 
jokes,” he said, “but practical. Let’s 
go. 

They slipped out on the Floor, 
talking on radcommunication now. 
He showed her how to work the 



57 




motor and they moved off under 
power until they began to feel kelp 
fronds slap against their suits. 

She stopped him. 

“Where are you going?” 

He pointed behind them to 
the faint, glowing dot that was the 
dome they’d just vacated. “The 
men of the ocean are guarding all 
the domes tonight. We were lucky 
to have entered that one when the 
guard W 21 S out working the line. 
We can’t go back. So we might as 
well return to Long Beach under 
our own power, now that you’ve 
had a look at the Floor.” 

“I’m not ready — to go in yet.” 
The trouble with half-trained 
agents is that they don’t know the 
full dangers. And this was no time 
for lectures. The guard patrolling 
the Walkway would soon be back 
to the dome of Station 54 and in- 
stantly notice the missing propel- 
lers. He would also probably have 
the flash on their escape from one 
of the ocean men on die Sub. 

First he would pulse a warning 
to the Kelp-cutter’s headquarters, 
probably Cady’s No. Three mine. 
Then he would start out after 
them. Meanwhile in the head- 
quarters the silent men would be 
gathered around a map, plotting 
the movements of the outsiders 
who had invaded the Floor to- 
night. 

Jim had seen the hand-radar net- 
work in operation before, and a 
minnow couldn’t get through from 
the mainland if the men of the 
ocean didn’t want it to. Anybody 
they picked up close to shore would 
be sent back to the land safely 
enough — ^but those they found back 

58 



here in the kelp in the inner de- 
fenses — 

Jim felt his heart quicken. 

He had to know whether the 
girl were an agent or not — and he 
had to know fast. He put a strangle 
hold on her and cut her air intake 
to almost nothing. 

“Talk!” 

She was strong, but Jim was 
thinking of the radar-net and the 
spear-guns and the determined 
men on the Floor. They sank to 
the bottom, sliding in the ooze. He 
maintained control. 

“All — all right,” she whistled 
finally. 

He knelt above her, his miner’s 
lamp on low peering anxiously into 
the glass helmet. He could only 
make out the eyes, but the look of 
innocence was gone. 

“I was hired by the Real Estate 
Foundation to try to reach Old 
Man Cady,” she said. “Now what?” 

“Then the rumor is true — that 
the Foundation got the Old Man 
to sign an option on his Floor prop- 
erty while at Long Beach Memori- 
al.” 

“I guess so. Don’t know. I — I’m 
from Fullerton. I really am — Si 
sociologist. Junior College. I’d done 
some work on the Floor and its 
problems. I can wear a suit and 
dive. They offered me a lot of 
money. I needed the money.” 

“Why?” 

“Why?” she laughed shortly. 
“What do you care?” 

“Give me your motive.” 

“I wanted five thousand to go 
study the red ants on Venus,” she 
spat out over radcom. 

Jim stood up. The men of the 

R. E. BANKS 




ocean were coming now. You 
couldn’t see them nor could you 
hear them. But over the years he 
recalled the faint rhythmic vibra- 
tions of the seat propellers that the 
men of the ocean used. As a kid, 
he could’ve told how many they 
were. Now he only knew they were 
coming. 

“Let’s move,” he said. 

They moved off into the kelp. 
The seaweed was a darker mass in 
the darkness and looked like an 
impenetrable wall. But the jungle 
was only a growing mass of plants, 
rooted to the bottom, leafing up 
with bulbous floats, reaching for 
the surface where it had to have 
the sun, like 2iny plant, for photo- 
synthesis. They brushed into the 
clogging, choking stuff, the skin 
effect of their suits transmitting the 
feeling to them. There were tim- 
nels in the kelp, but you had to 
know how to find them. Jim found 
them, marveling that the girl from 
Fullerton would believe she had a 
chance on the Floor. She couldn’t 
have known he would follow her 
from the shore to help. Either she 
was to meet a confederate at The 
Forks or her motive was one of 
desperation. Presently he would 
have to know which. 

Meanwhile, he led the way, stay- 
ing close to the bottom. Sometimes, 
he dived to a rock and burrowed 
against it. Sometimes, he left the 
timnel in the kelp to slide and 
twist through the kelp forest itself 
and emerge in the tunnel again. He 
was making it a little tough for 
hand radar, he hoped. 

Helen followed, helpless at the 
moment to argue. They were in the 

MEN OF THE OCEAN 



center of the kelp fann now. A 
faint beep signal from the detector 
in his suit began to guide him. The 
signal meant human habitation. In 
the absolute darkness and sliding 
nothingness of the water it was 
good to know that there was a 
farm home buoy ahead. 

Suddenly there was a faint vibra- 
tion above, a different sort. A metal 
spear tip, propelled by a killing 
charge of CO2 cut past them as 
their silent pursuers caught a flash 
of them. Jim instantly cut his hel- 
met light; he had already made 
Helen douse hers. He saw the di- 
rection of the tow-line paying out 
behind the spearhead; and dove 
into the kelp mass at a tangent, 
cutting off his propeller motor. 
They sank, nested in the mass, mo- 
tionless. He spent the waiting time 
in clearing her propeller of the sea- 
weed that die constantly tangled 
with, and they bumped body to 
body in a silence that was so deep 
he could hear the thump of his 
own heart. 

The hunt on the ocean floor was 
different. Silence — ^the sudden ag- 
gression — and if you were smart 
and didn’t swim in panic, half the 
time the hunter couldn’t find you. 
A novice would’ve spurted into a 
swim of death, but Jim remem- 
bered the old ways and forced the 
discipline of inaction on his nervous 
system that cried out to be moving. 
At last sufficient time had passed 
so that they dared to move again, 
no motor vibrations being discerni- 
ble. 

And now — 

They broke into a clearing. The 
farm home buoy loomed dark in 

59 




front of them, its anchor line go- 
ing to the bottom, but floating 
easily, its majestic weight swaying 
with the currents. Jim went right 
to it, forcing out thoughts of what 
couldVe happened in fifteen years. 
He broke into the entrance lock 
and pushed the bell desperately. 

“Who?” said a voice, and he al- 
most fainted. 

His luck was running tonight — 

“Jim Talbot,” he said. 

There was a silence from the 
wall speaker. Helen took off her 
bowl and stared at him in white- 
faced puzzlement. 

“Jim — Talbot,” whispered the 
feminine, metallic wall-voice. 

“For Christ’s sake, Bea, let us 
in!” cried Jim. 

T he farm home buoy swayed 
and rolled seventy-five feet be- 
low the surface, twenty feet above 
the Floor. The little woman in 
slacks and a short hair-cut who 
faced them stared at Jim as if he 
were a parolee from death. Jim 
stood there, buckling his knees to 
get used to the long-forgotten mo- 
tion of the farm home buoy. Helen 
who had no sea-legs, collapsed in 
a chair, puzzled. 

“So you’ve come back,” said the 
woman in slacks. 

“All the way. Did you — is he — ” 
“I married him,” she said. “That 
was twelve years ago. We have a 
child. She’s sleeping upstairs.” She 
gestured at the ceiling. 

“Your parents?” 

“They died.” 

Jim let out a long, slow breath 
and sank into a chair. “It’s good 

60 



to know Ed lived,” he said. “After 
fifteen years. The last time I saw 
him, he was floating in the kelp 
with six inches of my spear stick- 
ing in him.” 

“It could’ve been different,” she 
said. He felt sorry for her with the 
lines in her face now, and the gray- 
fringed hair. But she still had that 
delicate, fragile beauty. And may- 
be she felt sorry for him, for he had 
aged too. But in the end the heart 
couldn’t speak. The heart can 
never speak except in the phrases 
of melodrama. “Could have been 
different”, “So you’re back.” He 
thought of the hours and hours of 
unspoken interior monologues he’d 
had with the image of her, and here 
she was, and here he was, back on 
the Floor again, and as usual the 
time was short, as it always was 
throughout life, and he couldn’t 
break down in front of a stranger 
and say “My God, how the hell 
have you been — ” 

“How’s kelp-farming?” he asked 
instead. 

“Horrible,” she said. “It’s done 
and over. The kelp-price has brok- 
en forever. They’re spore-farming 
up there now, with those spores 
the spacemen — you spacemen — 
brought back to Earth. Kelp-cut- 
ting is done. We fed the world for a 
generation and they don’t need kelp 
any more, all the hungry millions 
and millions.” 

“What’s the kelp-price?” 

“A nickel a hundredweight,” 
she said. 

“God in heaven.” 

There was a faint stir below. 
“You’ve got to pass me over,” 
said Jim. “I’m on my way to see 

R. E. BANKS 




the Old Man and you’ve got to 
pass me over.” 

A spasm of uncertainty crossed 
her face. “Jim, you don’t belong 
any more. Ed’s still a kelp-cutter. 
I’m his wife. He’s out tonight, 
working the net, trying for a few 
more hours to save things. All out- 
siders are enemies tonight.” 

“Kelp-cutting’s done. Sea-min- 
ing’s done. The people of the land 
need your space to live in, Bea. It 
won’t matter if Old Cady dies with- 
out selling his land to the Founda- 
tion. The world needs it. The 
world’ll get it.” 

“And you’ll get millions if your 
uncle sells out to them,” said Bea 
bitterly. “Is that why I’ve got to 
pass you over?” 

Helen sat up with a gasp. 

“I won’t get millions,” said Jim. 
“I won’t get anything at all. The 
Old Man doesn’t care much for his 
relatives that deserted the ocean.” 
“The option they tricked him in- 
to signing while he was in the hos- 
pital expires tomorrow,” said Bea. 
“He may not live that long. Then, 
in his will, the land goes to the Un- 
derwater Association, they say. In 
perpetuity.” she sighed. “The As- 
sociation will never give up the 
land to the Real Estate Founda- 
tion. Like Ed says, let ’em build 
houses in the Atlantic. Why don’t 
they try the Gulf of Mexico?” 
There wasn’t time to argue. Jim 
took the little woman in his arms. 
“You’ve got to pass me over, Bea,” 
he said desperately. 

A strange voice came at them 
from the intercom. A firm voice 
asking for admittance to the home 
buoy for a search. 

MEN OF THE OCEAN 



Bea shuddered. “Jim — I can’t 
hide you!” 

But Helen was on her feet. From 
her inside pocket she had a wallet 
out. Jim saw something green then 
and started to cut Helen off. “You 
fool, don’t—” 

But Helen pushed Jim aside. 
“How much?” she said. “Here’s 
five hundred — ^no, a thousand!” 

Bea blushed. Jim was about to 
snatch the money from the table 
and throw it back at Helen, but 
Bea picked up the bills. 

“It’s been hard, very hard,” she 
said, her bright eyes studying Jim’s 
face. 

“Where can we hide?” asked 
Helen. 

“She took the money!” Jim 
whispered in the darkness. 

“I don’t blame her. With those 
kelp-prices it must be rough, feed- 
ing and clothing a family.” 

In the darkness Jim tried to 
swallow his bitterness. For the first 
time he truly felt the desperation 
of the men of the ocean. But hadn’t 
kelp-foods always been doomed? 
There had always been something 
a little wrong with them. Seaweed 
had bulk and was rich in minerals 
washed down by the rivers of the 
land, absorbed by the ocean plants. 
Enriched by vitamins and proteins, 
it had carried mankind along but 
was tasteless. Spore-farming yielded 
rich, sun-grown crops today. The 
kelp-cutters had suffered for many 
months now. Could he blame Bea 
for snatching the money? 

“I take it you shot a man and 
had to leave. Otherwise you’d have 
married her,” said Helen. 



61 




“I would have.” 

“Don’t blame her for not wait- 
ing either,” said Helen. “In life 
you make the best of what exists.” 
“I don’t,” snapped Jim and she 
dianged the subject. 

“Are we safe here?” 

“There’s a secret place on each 
farm home buoy,” said Jim. 
“That’s where tte kelp-cutters 
keep their money, because there 
aren’t any banks on the ocean floor. 
The men of the ocean would never 
ask the location of anyone’s house 
safe. We’re in it. We’re okay.” 
Helen stirred in the darkness. 
“Jim — ^why are you helping me? I 
mean, if you don’t stand to gain 
from the sale of the land.” 

“Red ants on Venus.” 

She was silent. Then she said 
slowly. “All right. I do have a good 
reason for being on the Floor as an 
agent of the Foimdation. My hus- 
band worked for them. He took 
some money to speculate. The 
Foundation manager will prosecute 
unless I can help him on this option 
business. I can’t afford to fail.” 
“Why didn’t your husband come 
himself?” 

“Because,” she said softly, “he 
was stabbed when he tried to get in 
to see Old Man Cady at Long 
Beach Memorial Hospital, day be- 
fore yesterday. He may live and he 
may not, but he won’t want to, if 
I fail.” 

Jim listened for the sincerity. It 
was there. 

“And you?” she asked. 

Faintly, as if far away, he could 
hear the pursuers arguing with 
Bea. He decided he would have to 
level with Helen. 



“I’ve been faired by the Space- 
men’s Retirement Fund,” he said. 
“We want the Floor. If I can get 
it, they’ll make me manager of the 
whole operation.” 

“Why the Floor for retired space- 
men?” 

“What else to do with the old 
men of space?” asked Jim. “They 
can’t stand the rigors of the new 
space colonies. And they can’t find 
any land on the monstrous cities of 
Earth, except the poorest of re- 
claimed desert land, which is a 
hell of a desolate place to end your 
life. But under the ocean it’s dif- 
ferent. Quiet. Everybody is equal. 
A yoimg man can’t move much 
faster than an old one. They can 
raise a little kelp, do a little sea- 
mining to bolster their pensions. 
The low prices won’t matter to 
them. They can go into town on 
Saturday, and the rest of the time 
play cards, drink and think. Space- 
men don’t mind wearing pressure 
suits and they rather prefer soli- 
tude or they wouldn’t be in space. 
The only thing they really want to 
get away from is hustle and bustle 
— and the Floor is perfect for that.” 

“Maybe we can work out some- 
thing between the Foundation and 
the Retirement Fund,” she said. 
“Maybe we can share the Floor.” 

“No,” said Jim. “This was my 
project, and I sold it to the Retire- 
ment Fund. It only makes sense if 
I can buy all Cady’s land. Some 
for buildings, the rest for invest- 
ment. Otherwise the Retirement 
Fund will invest in a land establish- 
ment or a space-station which cost 
less.” 

“So your job as manager depends 



62 



R. E. BANKS 




on getting all the Floor land?” 
“Yes,” 

She was silent. “Something 
doesn’t fit. You have the knowledge 
of how to get to Cady. You have 
the incentive — a life-time job, per- 
haps even a dream fulfillment. 
That fits because as Manager of 
the project you’d become the big- 
gest man on the Floor, and every- 
one wants to return to his place of 
origin as a success. But you don’t 
need me at all. So why have you 
helped me?” 

Jim didn’t answer. 

She laughed. “Something tells 
me there’s skullduggery ahead. But 
I warn you now, I intend to fulfill 
my mission.” 

“Of course,” he said. 



H elen was his diversion. It 
could only be a matter of min- 
utes now, he thought as they swam 
along after leaving Bea’s place, be- 
fore she would realize why he had 
helped her. And then? 

When they found Cady’s Num- 
ber Three Mine, where the old 
man was probably hiding, Jim 
would need her. She needed him 
to get her to that spot. Once there, 
only one of them could succeed, 
and they were more dangerous to 
each other than the common 
enemy. 

He tried to convince himself 
that her position was hopeless com- 
pared to his. How would she get 
inside the mine? But he knew there 
were ways. Once in the mine, how 
could she reach Cady? Answer: 
Cady would insist on seeing any 
agent good enough to break the 

MEN OF THE OCEAN 



net, for Cady was that way. Once 
saw Cady bow could she, in 
the midst of hostile men of the 
ocean, get his signature to extend 
the option? For that matter, how 
could he? He smiled to himself. It 
could be done. It could be done, 
because Cady was smart, Cady 
knew the old Floor economy was 
done and would have signed be- 
fore, except that the men of the 
ocean captured him in a moment 
of sickness. But then, he reasoned, 
why wouldn’t Cady have already 
signed, despite agents and options? 

He knew the answer to that one, 
too. Like all old people, Cady 
thought he would live a Iktle longer 
and it would be a disagreeable task 
to sign away the Floor when it had 
been his whole life — ^he would 
wait imtil the last possible moment 
unless he were pushed. 

A mission was practical and 
could succeed. They had to get 
through, and yet only one of them 
must reach Cady. 

They spoke carefully of neutral 
things as they moved through the 
water. How skin divers in the old 
days had started the trek to the 
ocean. How the opening worlds of 
atomic science had allowed man- 
kind to flourish until they literally 
carpeted the world’s land with 
their myriad lives. How the land 
broke down as a food-supplier, and 
the sea rescued it, and now the 
spore-farming of space and the 
mining of space had made the econ- 
omy of the Floor obsolete. 

Already, the Hudson River in 
New York pointed the way to the 
new uses of the ocean. The famous 
deep-bottom apartments were com- 

63 




plete with movies, stores, hospitals. 
The rest of the continental shelf 
would follow and finally the true 
ocean depths, and the agrarian age 
of the ocean would be over. 

There was no doubt about it 
when they came to the Old Man’s 
hiding place. The men of the ocean 
had sacrificed subterfuge for 
strength, in their direct, lazy way. 
He was in Cady’s No. Three mine 
as Jim had expected, because it 
was the largest. Around the great 
metal mound that moved along the 
ocean floor was the fire-fly twinkle 
of the lights of some two dozen 
slowly-circling guards. They had 
floodlights on the exterior, turning 
the dark water to a sullen green 
and making the clean-swept white 
sand floor glitter. 

Jim and Helen sank behind a 
submerged rock to study the ter- 
rain. “Now, Jim,” said Helen, 
we’ve got to settle this thing. I 
know you plan to use me for a 
diversion so that you can get into 
the mine, but I can’t allow it.” 

“I’ve brought you through the 
radar net,” said Jim. “You couldn’t 
have made it on your own. In fact, 
I’ve saved your life, and I think I 
can find a way for you to get out 
with a whole skin — ” 

“Jim, Jim, don’t you see my 
need’s the greater? To you this is 
simply a way of proving yourself. 
To Bea — and the rest of the people 
on the Floor. That you can be the 
biggest man on the Floor. You can 
always go elsewhere and do better. 
You showed that once when you 
left the Floor and Bea.” 

“I had to.” 



“You didn’t have to shoot a man 
to prove your love for her. That 
was overdone. You don’t have to 
come back as the biggest man on 
the Floor, in charge of this won- 
derful new project. That’s over- 
done, too. You must have a ro- 
mantic notion of yourself.” 

“The spacemen need the Floor,” 
he said in hot defensive anger. 

“Maybe they do. But you won’t 
be any more successful with your 
project if you succeed than you 
were in your courtship with Bea, 
or with your space career, because 
nobody cooperates with somebody 
who always plays big-shot.” 

“Big-shot!” he laughed bitterly. 
“Little shot, Helen. My time in 
space is almost done. If I don’t put 
over this project, I’ve only got a 
few years of down-hill space travel 
left in me.” 

“You left the Floor to find some- 
thing,” she said. “You didn’t find 
it. Now you’re back, still hunting. 
What is it, Jim Talbot?” 

There are things too deep to say. 
He remembered his brother, ten 
years older, who had left the Floor 
for space. Who had come back to 
their drab farm home buoy wear- 
ing a uniform and medals. Who 
had come back with a beautiful 
land girl as his wife. Jim had been 
ten then, and his eyes grew big 
when Buck Talbot talked about 
the far-off places, the frozen, awing 
silences, tli strangeness and won- 
der of the deep velvet space sky. 
Jim remembered the size and 
shape and color of the medal his 
brother wore on his right breast 
“For Valor Beyond the Call of 
Duty”. He remembered how awed 

R. E. BANKS 



64 




his playmates had been with Buck 
and his land girl wife. And in die 
prime of his manhood, Buck had 
gone back into space and disap- 
peared forever, the girl along with 
him, and left behind an image that 
Jim, at least, had never forgotten. 

“What is it, Jim Talbot?” she 
asked. 

“Nothing,” he said. 

“I don’t even have a choice like 
you,” she said. “I’ve got to get 
through to preserve what little I’ve 
got. If you won’t help — ” 

She gave him a backward shove. 
One minute they were muttering, 
face-plate to face-plate. The next 
she had shoved him off balance 
and fired at him with her under- 
water pistol, which she must have 
stowed into her suit way back on 
the submarine when she was alone 
in the “Ladies”. 

Her inexperience betrayed her. 
She missed. 

In a swimming swoop he did a 
backward spin and came up with 
the short spear gun he had ac- 
quired at Bea’s. There was a rising, 
impatient anger inside of him, a 
sudden fury at her assault on his 
motives. He fired from the belt and 
he had had years of experience 
with guns. 

She took six inches of metal 
without a sound and floated there, 
spread out, her weight bumping 
her down towards the ocean floor, 
now that she was immobile. She 
gave one convulsive jerk and 
drifted, and the line from the gun 
twitched with her dead weight and 
the current’s sway. 

He couldn’t tell if he’d killed 
her. He only knew that the mo- 

MEN OF THE OCEAN 



ment for her to provide a diversion 
had come, not in the way he 
planned, but it was here, and the 
rest must be action. 

The group at the mine picked up 
the violent motions on hand radar 
and sped for the spot. He broke 
the spear gun line free and shoved 
his helmeted head in the loose ooze 
of the ocean floor, getting rid of the 
propeller. He let the water ar- 
range his limbs — ^he made like a 
rock. How many thousands of 
times as a kid had he made “rock” 
in the Floor games, the under- 
water version of hide and seek? 
Though the men of the ocean could 
see twice as well in their medium 
as the land-men, he knew he was 
only a wavy shadow on the ocean 
floor compared to the spread- 
eagled figure floating free. 

Five of the guards gathered her 
in and pushed her towards the 
mine. They didn’t see him because 
at the moment they weren’t look- 
ing for him. Jim boldly swam be- 
hind them at a short distance, his 
sea-lamp off, safe in the temporary 
confusion. 

As they approached the mine, 
he looked for the suction inlets on 
the bottom, sucking in the min- 
eral-rich ooze of the Floor as the 
entire dome structure traveled its 
way to Catalina and back. The 
mine was working. No man of the 
land would dare invade a mine via 
the silt tunnels. No man of the 
ocean would expect to get away 
with it. 

Jim let the others get ahead of 
him and dived ; he found the strong 
flow of the intake. There was a 
horrible moment while he was 



65 




pressed with the hard-flowing mud 
against a filter screen, the pressure 
crunching at his body then he 
broke the screen. He was sucked 
into the silt intake. The secret of 
not getting stuck in this passage, 
no bigger than a man’s body, was 
to keep moving, and he held his 
empty spear gun between his legs 
and fired off round after round 
into the soft mud, taking advan- 
tage of the backthrust of the gun 
to keep him moving. 

He ended up in the settling tanks 
with a plop, buried in mud. By 
now instruments in the mine would 
show that a large, foreign body 
had broken the screen and passed 
into the tank. They would investi- 
gate. 

Instead of trying to surface, Jim 
burrowed in the mud, beating down 
his claustrophobic fears of the 
thick stuff, reminding himself that 
it was only another medivim 
slightly thicker than water. 

He knew the position of the 
waste trap on the bottom of the 
tank and found it, feeling the suc- 
tion at the bottom pulling him 
down, to be ejected again when 
the tank was flushed. He went on 
down into the flush canal. Good. 
Their instruments would now show 
that the foreign body had passed 
out again. 

He put his rubber fingers to the 
wall, wedged himself tight and 
closed his eyes to wait. 

This time he’d have to be good. 
But then he was always equal to 
the task, wasn’t he? The girl, with 
all her need to win, had been in- 
efficient and bungling, and he who, 
according to her, was only trying 

66 



to play big-shot was the success. He 
grinned sardonically, and then re- 
membered he’d had to shoot her 
and lost his grin. He forced ex- 
traneous thoughts from his mind. 
He wasn’t inside the mine yet. 

He tried to visualize the control 
panel. The tank must be almost 
filled by now. He tried to think 
himself right at the point of the 
solenoid, ready to divine the switch 
of the motors from intake pump- 
ing over to flushing action. Again 
his experience paid off. 

He had done this once before 
when he worked for Schneider’s 
Deep-Sea Mines as a young man, 
and a foolish, visiting tourist had 
got himself sucked into the tank 
and Jim had had to go in and pull 
him out. 

The intake cycle ended. He had 
ten seconds while relays clicked, 
the mass was read, and the com- 
puter decided what minerals to re- 
tain, what to flush out. Jim made 
the supreme effort then, going back 
up the flush tunnel into the sedi- 
ment tank itself, burrowing up 
through the weight of the mud. He 
had three feet to go and he barely 
wriggled out of the opening when 
the flushing started and the sea 
water roared in, and the tank be- 
gan to swing to separate out the 
metals it wanted by centrifugal 
force. 

It was a wild ride, but not too 
bad if you didn’t mind being 
thrown around on the hard metal 
walls like a paper clip in a vacuum 
cleaner. In the rhythmic, spinning 
action the heavier metals settled 
out to the collecting pans and the 
waste silt began to pour through 

R. E. BANKS 




the flush outlet. Jim waited until 
the tank was nearly empty and the 
whirling action slowed to “idle”. 
Then he threw up his feet, struck 
open one of the “reach through” 
hatches and squirmed out into the 
mine proper, falling to the floor in 
exhaustion. He had not been de- 
tected. His entrance had been 
noted by the instruments on the in- 
let side. His exit had been noted 
on the outlet side. The machine 
had absorbed a two hundred and 
eighty pound rock and ejected it 
again. The instruments had noted 
the loss of the screen and replaced 
it at the end of the cycle, but they 
had no way of recording his return 
from the outlet hatch because for- 
eign bodies, once in the flush tunnel 
always obeyed the laws of force 
and gravity and went on out. Thus 
you could fool a machine as easily 
as a man, if you had more knowl- 
edge than it did. 

Jim grinned weakly to himself. 
Another factor helped him. Helen, 
the diversion. The men of the 
ocean certainly wouldn’t be bother- 
ing about instrument chart-bumps 
while they had the excitement of 
the girl to occupy them. 

Jim went upstairs to the main 
room and eased through the door. 



T hey had laid her on the low 
observation bunk, looking out 
the glass plate over the ocean floor 
where you sometimes sat to watch 
and guide the mine as it bumped 
its way along the bottom. In the 
old days you could spot the slow- 
moving mighty black sea bass and 
put on a suit and go out spear- 

MEN OF THE OCEAN 



fishing while the mine lumbered 
along. But there were almost no 
fish any more, between the main- 
land and Catalina, due to Floor 
civilization. A few small kelp bass 
and deep water ling cod were all 
that had survived. 

There was a doctor on duty 
there, naturally, and he was bent 
over the girl. They had taken off 
her suit and he had some kind of 
tube stuck in her chest. Draining 
her lungs of the blood from his 
shot, decided Jim, growing cold all 
over. 

The men of the ocean stood 
around, hang-dog, equipment dan- 
gling from big hands, their eyes 
soft, their white faces frowning. 
Though there might be a dozen 
bodies floating in the kelp tonight, 
a wounded enemy and a woman — 
that was different. 

He shouldered his way boldly 
through the crowd to her and 
looked down. Her cheeks seemed 
sunken, and the eyes were bright. 
He thought her mind wandered, 
but she looked directly at him. 

“You — ^made it.” 

“I always do.” 

She moved her hands. It cost 
effort but she had, suddenly, a 
paper there. Behind them the men 
of the ocean stirred and muttered 
and the doctor looked up sharply 
from his equipment. 

“My need — is greater,” she said. 

He couldn’t refuse to take the 
paper. It fell partly open. There 
was a snapshot inside — of two kids. 
He stood there, his back to the 
ocean men, feeling hot and cold, 
staring into the dying eyes. Her 
ploy, he decided, was a very good 

67 




ploy indeed. 

She smiled faintly as she saw his 
defeat. 

He turned around to the men 
of the ocean. “My name’s Jim Tal- 
bot,” he said. “I’m a nephew of 
Old Man Cady, and I’m just back 
from space. I want to see him.” 

A tall man raised a spear-gun. 
“My name’s Ferris, and we don’t 
remember you, Jim, not at all. The 
Old Man doesn’t remember the 
ones that have left the Floor.” 
“Don’t bubble me. Oyster-head,” 
said Jim, recognizing the man and 
remembering the old nickname. 
“I’ve licked you before and I can 
do it again.” 

Ferris raised his gun. There was 
a silence while you could hear the 
tortured breathing of the girl. 

Then she screamed, and she 
didn’t have to do it, but in that 
final diversion Jim came up with 
his muddy spear gun and flung it 
underhanded at Ferris and knocked 
the other’s gim away. He darted 
for the door of the Old Man’s 
apartment as he remembered it 
and the uproar started. But it didn’t 
last very long. There was a com- 
manding clang of an alarm bell, 
and the door swung open and a 
man rolled out in a wheel chair. 

“For the love of God,” piped a 
thin voice, “what’s going on here?” 
The men of the ocean fell back 
before the wizened old man in the 
wheel chair. The doctor cried out 
in protest “You must stay in bed.” 
The old man pounded on the metal 
floor with his cane and shouted in 
a quavery voice. “Shut up, every- 
body.” 

Tliey shut. 

68 



“Now you,” said Cady to Jim. 
“Your nephew,” said Jim rapid- 
ly, eyeing Ferris who had recov- 
ered his gun. “Jim Talbot, Ed’s 
son, back from space on an errand.” 
“Welcome back,” said the old 
man drily and pointed to the bunk. 
“And she—” 

“She is — ^was — an agent for the 
Foundation, trying to get through 
to you with a contract for the 
Floor. I helped her.” 

Ferris sprang forward with a 
cry “No contract!”. He went for 
Jim, but the old man’s cane tripped 
him and spread him on the deck. 

“You always were a fool, Fer- 
ris,” said the old man. He looked 
around the room, his aged, red- 
rimmed eyes reminding Jim of an 
ancient rooster’s. “What the hell’s 
wrong with everybody? You want 
to starve forever? Even your own 
goddam wives don’t want to see 
the Floor ruined. Look at you — 
kelp-cutters and miners. You used 
to hate each other’s guts. You used 
to fight like madmen about whether 
a patch of ground should be mined 
or farmed. Now you’re friends. You 
fight the Real Estaters, and you’ll 
end up friends with them, because 
the old way’s done on the Floor. 

“’Course I signed the option. 
They didn’t trick me in the Long 
Beach Hospital. I always meant to 
sign the option and the contract to 
save you fools a piece of living. 
Only my special bodyguard with 
Mr. Ferris in charge showed up 
and rushed me back here before I 
could finish the deal.” 

The old man paused. “When 
you get old, you get a little tired, 
so temporarily I had to let you 

R. E. BANKS 




have your way and bring me back 
here, I figured we’d talk it over 
later; but all you do is lock me in 
a room and shove medicine down 
my throat.” 

He made a gesture. He tossed 
a hand spear-gun to Jim. 

“Now Jim, lad, you can give me 
some help with these fools, before 
they kill me with medicine and 
their own foolish fears.” 

Jim took the gun and grinned, 
but the men of the ocean stared 
in shock at the peppery little man. 

“For fifty years I’ve run the 
Floor,” he lectured in heat. “I 
never did anything but what was 
right for all of you. Gave you 
credit. Helped you build farms and 
mines and farm home buoys. Sold 
your products. Whenever one of 
you went broke, I took over your 
land so that no outsiders could 
come in, and I kept you on, at a 
disastrous percentage that didn’t 
help my pocket, by God! My re- 
waid for keeping you going — you 
kick me in the tail. But I’m going 
to save you once more, just the 
same. Jim, where’s the agent’s con- 
tract?” 

Ferris started to protest but Jim 
forced the spear against his throat 
and Ferris stopped moving. Jim 
found the paper on the floor and 
flipped it to the old man who 
smiled up at Ferris. 

“Senile Old Man Cady,” said 
the old man. “Doesn’t know noth- 
ing, does he. Oyster-head? Listen 
to me, under this contract you’ll 
all get enough money for your vari- 
ous equities to either go into the 
apartment building business or 
take your cut and move out beyond 

MEN OF THE OCEAN 



Catalina and start a new farm or 
sea mine. This is a present from 
me and I don’t care which you do. 
Now before I sign I want to ask 
one thing — Anybody here who’s 
made a profit on farming or min- 
ing the last three months?” 

There was no answer. 

The old man nodded and smiled. 
“Permit a senile old man one fur- 
ther question, boys. What the hell 
are you going to do if we don’t sell 
this land and get some money? 
Mr. Ferris — any ideas?” 

“We’ll find new uses for the kelp 
to save the farms,” said Ferris. “To 
save the mines we’ll cut metal 
prices to meet space competition 
and hold on. We can make it, boys, 
if we can hold on.” 

Cady nodded. “Very good. 
Thought of the same thing myself 
a year and a half ago. Took the 
problem to CalTech and a couple 
of other research outfits. Paid a 
million for this study. The smartest 
research and marketing men in the 
United States say it can’t be done, 
but Mr. Ferris here has advan- 
tages they don’t. He never finished 
Floor high-school. Anybody else 
here want to string along with him? 
Be glad to give you your land back 
clear, even though most of you owe 
me plenty on it.” 

Nobody stirred. But Ferris had 
another shot in his locker. 

“How much do you make on this 
deal, Cady?” he asked. 

The old man smiled. “Plenty,” 
he said. “I’m just senile enough to 
still want to make a little dough, 
while you’re six months behind in 
all your payments, Ferris. I intend 
to go on making money as long as I 

69 




live. Anybody that doesn’t want 
to make money — vote for Ferris. 
He’ll save the Floor for you, if you 
want to eat kelp three times a day 
and wear seaweed clothes for the 
rest of your lives. Here’s your last 
chance, men. After all, the Founda- 
tion can buy sea land further up 
the coast and they won’t keep the 
offer open forever.” 

The old man lifted the pen to 
sign. Then he dropped it. “No, by 
God, I won’t sign unless everybody 
agrees. Even Ferris. The men of 
the ocean have always stuck to- 
gether and I plan to keep it that 
way. Talk to him, some of you.” 

Ferris looked slightly dazed. The 
men of the ocean moved up on 
him, muttering. “What’s the idea, 
Oyster-head?” “What gives there?” 
“What’s to use for money?” “You 
wanta ruin us?” 

“Oh, I’ll go along with the 
crowd,” cried Ferris Weakly. “Go 
ahead and sign. I just wanted to 
make sure it was all on the up-and- 
up. Chief, that’s all. And I don’t 
like to see this lousy Spacer here 
making dough off us.” 

The old man chuckled and 
signed the contract. “Then you 
should’ve talked to me, instead of 
slapping me into the hands of the 
doctor and shutting me up with 
thermometers and medicines,” he 
said. “As for Jim and his friend — 
the Foundation hired ’em. Let the 
Foundation pay ’em. Once a man 
leaves the Floor he isn’t a part of 
my family no more.” 

The old man flung the contract 
at Jim and then he wheeled up to 
the bunk where Helen lay. 

“It looks like the Foundation 



will get off cheap this trip,” he 
said softly. He took the blanket and 
pulled it over the girl’s face. The 
white, thin hands patted the still 
figure. “A nice-looking girl, Jim. 
Too bad.” 

Then with a thoughtful frown 
the old man wheeled himself back 
into the bedroom and closed the 
door. 

The men of the ocean broke out 
into a babble. “Boy, that was 
close,” said a sea-miner who had 
spent twenty-four hours in trying 
to prevent the signing. “Like he 
says, the Foundation might not’ve 
signed with us if we’d held off 
much longer.” Heads nodded in 
agreement and the men pressed 
around Jim, begging to have the 
honor of signing the contract as 
witnesses. 

That, thought Jim, was real sales- 
manship. He let them fight over 
the contract, turned back to the 
still figure on the bunk. He pulled 
back the blanket and studied the 
dead face. It was girlish in its re- 
laxation, but the worry lines of the 
mother-provider were there and an 
aura of competence he hadn’t 
noted before. 

Yes, she would forgive him for 
his shot that ended her life. She 
had understood better than he, 
that she couldn’t make the mission 
alone. Once he had begun to guide 
her, she knew that she must win 
him to her cause at all costs, and 
the cost had been high indeed. She 
had correctly judged that she 
couldn’t win him except by finding 
and using his weakness — ^his need 
to make the heroic gesture. 

All of his life he had made the 



70 



R. E. BANKS 




gesture in the manner of his big 
brother. Buck Talbot. With Bea 
years ago on the Floor, in his space 
career, and on the day he had 
stalked into the Retirement Fund 
squabble and played strong man 
with his solution. And in the end 
Helen had allowed him to play 
hero for two kids in Glendale 
whose future would now be secure. 
No wonder there was a half-smile 
on the dead lips. He pulled up the 
blanket and went to draw himself 
a black cup of coffee, winking back 
the tears of sadness. 

He looked up and saw, for the 
first time, a teen-age youth who 
had been staring at Helen’s body 
and was now staring at him. The 
features resembled Ferris, and Jim 
figured it was Ferris’s boy. The lad 
came up with adolescent awkward- 
ness, compulsion-driven but shy, 
his eyes shining on Jim’s uniform 
now that he had shed his diving 
suit. 

“What’s it like out there, mis- 
ter?” he asked. “What’s space 
like?” 

Jim put his hand on the lad’s 
shoulder. “Son, it’s just about like 
every place else, a lot of fun and a 
lot of dull waiting in between.” 

But the lad refused to down- 
grade his illusions. 



“You’re a space captain,” he 
said in awe. “You run a space 
ship.” 

Then Jim did what Buck Talbot 
should’ve done for him, years ago. 

“It’s sixty feet long,” said Jim, 
nodding. “It’s got a lot of machin- 
ery and four other guys besides my- 
self. We carry freight and in be- 
tween times play cards, and I tell 
the boys what it’s like under the 
ocean and they think it must be 
pretty wonderful down here.” 

The lad looked puzzled and the 
glamor slipped out of his eyes. 
“Oh,” he said. He turned away. 

Something stirred inside Jim 
too. The ghost of Buck Talbot was 
laid to rest at last. He had done 
the thing that had to be done for 
Helen, for Old Cady, for the men 
of the ocean and for the land peo- 
ple. He had even done a little 
something for Ferris and his son. 
And through it all he had done 
nothing for himself, nothing at all. 
This was the role he’d always 
yearned to play and he had played 
it to the hilt. 

Done nothing for himself? No — 
he wouldn’t have to make the ges- 
ture any more, and his was the 
greatest reward of all, self-knowl- 
edge, a guide for the rest of his 
life. • • •

BY WINSTON MARKS 



I T WAS a deathless world, but a 
woman was dying. 

Anne Tabor lay limp and pale, 
her long, slender limbs making only 
shallow depressions on the mercury 
bath which supported her. Webb 
Fellow stood over her awaiting the 
effects of the sedative to relieve her 
pain. 

His title was Doctor, but almost 
everyone in this age had an M. D. 
certificate with several specialties 
to his credit. Webb Fellow was sim- 
ply one who continued to find in- 



terest and diversion in the field of 
physiological maintentance. 

He stood tall and strong above 
her, lean-bellied, smooth-faced and 
calm appearing, yet he didn’t feel 
especially calm. As the agony eased 
from Anne’s face he spoke softly. 

“I’m glad you came to me, 
Anne.” 

She moistened her lips and spoke 
without opening her eyes. “It was 
you or Clifford — and Cliff hasn’t 
practiced for a century or more. 
It’s — ^it’s quite important to me. 



72 




Webb. I really want to live. Not 
because Vm afraid of dying, 
but . 

“I know, Anne. I know.” 

Everyone in Chicago knew. 
Anne Tabor was the first female 
of that city to be chosen for moth- 
erhood in almost a decade. And 
in the three days since the news 
had flashed from Washington, 
Anne Tabor had generated within 
the blood-stream of her lovely, 
near-perfect body, a mutated can- 
cerous cell that threatened to de- 
stroy her. Mutant leukemia! 

“Just relax, dear. We have the 
whole city of Chicago to draw on 
for blood while we work this thing 
out.” 

He touched a cool hand to her 
fevered forehead, and the slight 
motion stirred the golden halo that 
her hair made on the silvery sur- 
face of the mercury. 

The word, “dear”, echoed 
strangely in his ears once he had 
said it. Her eyes had opened at the 
expression of sentiment, and now 
they were wide and blue as they ex- 
amined him. A tiny smile curved 
her pale lips. “Did I hear cor- 
rectly?” 

“Yes, dear.” He repeated the 
word deliberately, and for the first 
time since his student days he felt 
the web of his emotions tighten and 
twist into a knot of unreason. 

She mustn’t die . not now! 

Her smile widened with her look 
of mild amazement. “Why Webb, 
I do believe you mean it!” 

“You have always been high in 
my affections, Anne.” 

“Yes, but — it's a long life. Such 
a long life!” 




73 




That damned phrase again! The 
essence of sanity, they called it. 
The cliche of cliches that under- 
scored this whole business of im- 
mortality. Be not concerned for the 
frustrations of the moment. All ob- 
stacles are transient — all obstacles 
and all emotions. The price of im- 
mortality is caution, patience, tem- 
perance, Deep personal attach- 
ments lead to love, love leads to 
jealousy, jealousy to un-saneness, 
insanity to violence, violence to — ” 

All he had said was that she was 
high in his affections, but no one 
spoke of such things any more. 
When one did, it was considered 
that more than conventional pro- 
miscuity was involved in his inten- 
tions. 

He turned away abruptly and 
studied the dials that registered 
her blood-pressure, pulse and me- 
tabolism. Incredible how even 
women three hundred years old re- 
mained sensitive to the slightest 
sign of infantile passion in their 
men. And more fantastic yet, that 
he, Webb Fellow, of the original 
generation of immortals some 
seven hundred years old, should 
find the destructive spark of pos- 
sessiveness still alive in his seman- 
tically adjusted nervous system. 

Mechanically he noted the sys- 
tole and diastole lines on the re- 
volving chart and ordered an at- 
tendant to administer whole blood. 
Before he left her he turned back 
for a moment. “It shouldn’t be 
more than 24 hours, Anne, and I 
promise you there won’t be any im- 
pairment of your maternal ca- 
pacity.” 

He was startled to note that tears 
74 



welled into her eyes. “Thank you, 
Webb. Clifford was worried that I 
might be disqualified.” 

“Nonsense! Clifford hasn’t kept 
up on things.” He strode away with- 
out further comment, but as he 
stepped from surgery into pathology 
he was troubled. Why was Clifford 
so worried about her? Did Clifford 
think that Anne would choose him 
to father her child? 

The thought struck like a snake. 
Before he could block it the fangs 
were deep, and the venom of ado- 
lescent jealousy raced from brain 
to endocrines to blood-stream, poi- 
soning his whole nervous system. 

It^s a long life! 

He resorted to the old antidote 
himself, despising his weakness as 
he breathed the words. They came 
out as a sigh. He discovered that 
he was searching his memory to de- 
termine whether he or Clifford 
could lay claim to Anne by sen- 
iority. 

Seniority? What damned non- 
sense was that? Anne had traded 
back and forth between Clifford 
and him for at least 250 years — 
with uncounted, trivial alliances 
with how many other men? 

But the others didn’t count. It 
was he and Clifford whom Anne 
preferred, just as he and Clifford 
had discussed on countless occa- 
sions Anne’s perpetual attraction to 
them both. Anne was Clifford’s fa- 
vorite, and he’d made no secret 
of it. 

“Over here, Webb. We have it!” 
It was Porter, the head staff pa- 
thologist holding out a small vial 
of crimson-clear liquid. “This fer- 
ric-protein salt should cure our 

WINSTON MARKS 




famous lady quite quickly. It played 
sudden hell in the culture.” 

“Oh, yes? Fine. Thank you, Por- 
ter. Thank you very much!” 

The narrow-shoiildered pathol- 
ogist gave him a second look. “Cer- 
tainly. Don’t mention it.” He 
paused then asked bluntly, “Did 
she name you for paternity?” 
Webb managed to hold the vial 
steady to the light, but his voice 
was a shade too taut and high. 
“Not yet — that is, we haven’t dis- 
cussed it. It’s a possibility, I sup- 
pose,” 

“I suppose,” Porter mocked gen- 
tly. “You with the highest genetic- 
desirability rating in the State, give 
or take a couple of counties.” 

Yes, there were a couple other 
males in Illinois with as high a 
genetic rating as Webb Fellow, and 
one of them was Clifford Ainsley. 

The obvious question thrust it- 
self upon Webb for the first time. 
Was that why Anne Tabor had 
seemed to concentrate her favors 
upon him and Clifford? Had she 
actually anticipated the eventuality 
of being chosen for motherhood, 
and had her criterion for male 
companionship been simply a high 
genetic rating? 

Ifs a long life. Even with such 
unlikely odds against the contin- 
gency, he supposed any qualified 
female secretly nurtured the hope 
that someday — 

With the inexplicable tension 
mounting in him he passed the 
vial along to an assistant with in- 
structions for administering it. 
Anne would be in no condition to 
discuss the matter for another day 
or two. 



But he must know. He must 
know whether she had already 
chosen Clifford. 

He slipped into a light street- 
jacket, caught an express to top- 
side and engaged a taxi. His fin^r 
was poised over the destination dial 
before he realized with a start that 
he had forgotten the five-digit num- 
ber for Clifford’s address. It had 
been that long since he had called 
on his old friend. 

Friend? The concept seemed 
suddenly strange. How long since 
their friendship had actually dis- 
solved into an unacknowledged 
rivalry? 

Nonsense. He and Clifford had 
both been uncommonly busy with 
their respective professions. And 
since Clifford had branched from 
medicine into robotics, their paths 
and interests had simply diverged. 
Alternating almost weekly between 
the two men, Anne Tabor had kept 
each more or less informed of the 
other’s activities, but somehow he 
and Clifford had ceased looking 
each other up. 

The directory gave him Clifford’s 
number, and he dialed it. The 
small vehicle lifted quickly, slipped 
into the invisible traffic pattern and 
began applying the dialed code- 
address to the electronic grid that 
cross-hatched Chicago like a mam- 
moth waffle. As traffic cluttered 
ahead on one particular striation, 
the taxi banked smoothly and right- 
angled to the next parallel course 
and proceeded. 

Neat, safe, fool-proof. Perfect 
transportation within proscribed 
geometrical limits, Webb thought. 
An infinite number of routes from 



UNTIL LIFE DO US PART 



75 




one point to another — ^like the 
course of a human life — ^but all 
within certain proscribed limits. 

It's a long life. 

The course of a man’s life could 
be considered a passage with in- 
finite possibilities only if he were 
allowed to backtrack occasionally. 
Was that what he was doing? Had 
life grown so dull that he was seek- 
ing the diversion of immaturity 
again? 

ImmcArtality. 

Was it really so important? Once 
there had been a time when love, 
open, unashamed love had been 
accepted as one of life’s strongest 
motivations. And it wasn’t just a 
feeling of jealous possessiveness. 
There was a feeling of mutuality in 
it, a tenderness, an unselfishness 
and closeness of communion be- 
tween man and woman. 

How had this exalted condition 
become debased into the casual 
association that now existed be- 
tween the sexes? Debased? That 
was a loaded term. What was the 
matter with him? Anne Tabor was 
a lovely, desirable creature, but no 
more lovely, no more desirable 
than a hundred other females he 
knew. 

An odd, almost unique feeling 
of shame swept over him as his cab 
sank to the landing strip on Clif- 
ford’s apartment building. He must 
conceal his state of mind from 
Clifford or be judged a complete 
imbecile. 



W ELL, Webb! This is a sur- 
prise.” Cliff’s face was entire- 
ly without emotion. “Anne! It’s 

76 



about Anne, isn’t it?” 

“Anne will be fine.” 

“Good, good! You startled me, 
standing there in the door like a 
messenger of doom. I thought for 
a moment — ^well, things wouldn’t 
be the same without little Annie, 
would they?” 

They had moved into ClifTs 
apartment, and Webb shrugged 
out of his jacket. The spacious 
quarters and expensive appoint- 
ments reminded Webb of Clifford’s 
wealth. 

“The robot business must be 
thriving,” Webb remarked. “Anne 
didn’t mention such luxury over 
here.” 

“The girl is tactful, my friend. 
Tactful, sweet, intelligent.” 

Webb looked up quickly. He 
had seated himself, and Clifford 
stood before him in a stiff, almost 
challenging pose. “Am I welcome 
here?” the physician asked bluntly. 

“Certainly, certainly. We’ll al- 
ways welcome you here. Nothing 
need be changed just because Anne 
is to have a child. Nothing, that is, 
except the customary observance 
of monogamous convention until 
the child is bom and raised.” 

A pound of lead sagged in 
Webb’s stomach. “Then — Anne has 
named you for paternity?” 

Clifford’s slender, well-made 
body lost itself in the precise cen- 
ter of an over-size chair, he looked 
at Webb thoughtfully. “Well, prac- 
tically. We were discussing it the 
other night when she had the first 
symptoms of this attack.” He 
rubbed his hairless chin. “Why? 
Did you especially aspire to the 
noble station of parenthood?” 

WINSTON MARKS 




The lazy sarcasm was salt in the 
wound. With difficulty, Webb kept 
his face cxpresiionless. “When I 
heard the news, naturally I gave 
the possibility some consideration. 
That’s why I came over here.” 

“I see. Anne didn’t tell you.” 

“She was in considerable distress 
when they brought her in. I — I 
didn’t ask her.” 

In spite of the raven-black hair 
and youthful face, there was some- 
thing about Clifford that Webb 
didn’t like, a hardness, a lack-luster 
indifference verging on boorish- 
ness. The thought of losing Anne 
completely for more than eighteen 
years to this man was more pain- 
ful even than Webb had antici- 
pated. 

Impulsively he said, “For old 
time’s sake, Cliff, will you do me a 
big favor?” 

The engineer stared at him and 
waited. 

“Take a vacation. Disappear for 
a few months.” 

The dark eyebrows remained in 
a straight line. “And run out on 
Anne? You aren’t serious.” 

1 am. 

Clifford laughed without smil- 
ing. “You’d better head for hor- 
mone harbor and take yourself a 
vacation, old man. You’re becom- 
ing senile.” 

“Then you won’t withdraw?” 

“Of course not. You’re asking 
more than a favor. You’re asking 
me to offend Anne. These things 
are important to females.” 

“It’s important to me, too, Cliff.” 

“Well, I’ll be—” The .smaller 
man rolled to his feet and put his 
hands on his hips. “I never ffiought 

UNTIL LIFE DO US PART 



to see the day when honored Elder 
Webb F#Uow would come muling 
around like a sub-century fresh- 
man. Of all the anachronistic 
drivel!” 

“You see?” Webb said eagerly, 
“It isn’t important to you at all. 
Why can’t you do this for me, 
Cliff? I — I just can’t stand the 
thought of being without Anne all 
those years.” 

“Relax, Webb. It^s a long life. 
Anne will be back in circulation 
before you know it.” He paced to a 
low desk and extracted a small 
address book from a drawer. “If 
you’re short of female acquaint- 
ances at the moment you can have 
these. I won’t be needing them for 
awhile.” 

He flipped the book at Webb. By 
chance the cover opened, caught 
the air and slanted the book up in 
its course so it struck the physi- 
cian’s cheek with a slap. The faint 
sting was the detonator that ex- 
ploded all the careful restraint of 
seven centuries. 

Webb arose to his feet slowly 
and moved toward Clifford, “So 
medicine was too elementary for 
you? Human physiology and be- 
haviour has no unsolved problems 
in it, you said once. So you went 
into robotics — positronic brains — 
infinite variety of response, with 
built in neuroses and psychoses. 
Human behaviour was too stereo- 
typed for you, Clifford. Everyone 
was predictable to seven decimal 
places. You were bored.” 

“You have it about right,” the 
engineer said insolently. He let his 
arms drop to his sides, relaxed, un- 
concerned at the tension in the 



77 




physician’s voice. 

‘‘You build fine chess-playing 
machines, I hear,” Webb said 
softly, gradually closing the dis- 
tance between them. “Your me- 
chanical geniuses have outstripped 
our finest playwrights and novelists 
for creativity and originality. 
You’ve probed every conceivable 
aberrated twist of human nature 
with your psychological-probabili- 
ties computers. You’ve reduced so- 
ciology and human relations to a 
cipher — ” 

Clifford shrugged. “Merely an 
extension of early work in general 
semantics — the same work that 
gave us mental stability to go with 
physical immortality. Certainly you 
don’t disparage — ” 

“I’m disparaging nothing,” Webb 
broke in. “I’m merely pointing out 
your blind spot, your fatal blind 
spot.” 

“Fatal?” 

“Yes, Clifford, fatal. I’m going 
to kill you.” 

The words seemed to have no 
effect. Not until Webb’s powerful 
surgeon’s hands closed about his 
neck did Clifford go rigid and be- 
gin his futile struggle. 

Webb did not crush the larynx 
immediately. He squeezed down 
with slow, breath-robbing pressure, 
feeling for the windpipe under his 
thumbs. Clifford gasped, “ *Sa long 
life, Webb . don’t . , commit 
suicide.” 

“It’s a long life, but not for you, 
my stupid friend. Sure, they’ll exe- 
cute me. But you won’t have her. 
Never again, do you hear?” 

Clifford’s eyes were closed now, 
and Webb knew that the roaring 

78 



in his victim’s ears would be blot- 
ting out all external soimd. The 
knowledge infuriated him, and he 
screamed, “You fool, I pleaded 
with you. I took your insults and 
gave you every clue you needed — 
didn’t you recognize my condition? 
You fool! You brilliant, blind 
fool!” 

Clifford collapsed to his knees, 
and Webb let him go with one final, 
irrevocable wrench that certified 
his death. 

Clifford’s death and his own. 
The penalty for murder was still 
capital punishment, and in his own 
case Webb acknowledged the logic 
and necessity of such harsh con- 
sequences. 

If there was one activity that 
immortal, 28th Century Man could 
no longer afford, it was the luxury 
of falling in love. 

W EBB stood back and looked 
down at his crumpled victim. 
The heavy pressure was subsiding 
from his temples, and the gray film 
of irrational hate faded from his 
vision. 

“Cliff— I—” Then full horror 
closed in on him and he choked 
off. His hands felt slick and slip- 
pery, but it was his own sweat, not 
blood. The tactile memory of his 
fingers squeezing, crushing Clif- 
ford’s 'throat, fed details of touch, 
texture and temperature to his tor- 
tured but clear brain. His surgeon’s 
fingers were twitching, trying to 
tell him what they had discovered 
moments ago, but a more over- 
whelming thought blocked the 
message. 



WINSTON MARKS 




Vve taken a man^s life , . and 
my own. And ruined Anne^s hap- 
piness. Vve brought her tragedy in- 
stead of happiness. 

No, not tragedy. Inconvenience. 
It would still be a long life for 
Anne. She would find a suitable 
mate, then her child would quickly 
erase the memory of this day. 

Still, he had committed murder, 
the first deliberate murder the 
world had known in centuries. 
“Damn you!” he screamed down 
at the body. “Why didn’t you pro- 
tect yourself?” 

“Oh, I did, Webb, I did!” 

Webb spun to face the direction 
of the voice behind him. His eyes 
must be playing tricks — an after- 
image, perhaps. “Who are you?” 
Webb demanded. 

“Clifford Ainsley. The proto- 
type, that is, in the flesh and not a 
roboid.” He nodded at the body 
on the floor. “Ainsley the Second. 
Strictly a lab job.” 

“Cliff? Oh, my God!” Webb fell 
into a chair and sobbed with re- 
lief. 

Clifford Ainsley came to him 
and put a hand to his shoulder. 
“I’m truly sorry, Webb, but it was 
better this way. We can be thank- 
ful that I anticipated your actions.” 
Webb looked up. “You — ex- 
pected me to murder you?” 

“The p c — probability computa- 
tion — was remarkably high. You 
see, I ran your genetic pattern into 
the computer, added the double 
stress factor of Anne’s serious ill- 
ness and her forthcoming mother- 
hood, and the subtotal spelled out 
a four letter word.” 

Webb nodded slowly. “Love.” 

UNTIL LIFE DO US PART 



“Right. And you know the corol- 
lary to that. When I punched in 
the details of your relationship with 
Anne and me, well, the next sub- 
total read — ^homicide.” 

The expression of relief in 
Webb’s face changed to show the 
hurt he felt. “But if you knew all 
this, why did you have to play out 
this scene, even with a remote con- 
trol robot?” 

“To discharge the murder im- 
pulse, my friend. I had to play it 
straight, reacting just as I would 
to your demands, had I not known 
of your condition. Otherwise the 
computations would have been 
based on false inter-reaction prem- 
ises. And until you made the at- 
tempt on my life, you were a real 
danger to me — and yourself. Now 
the shock of your murder attempt 
and the relief at your failure have 
dissipated that danger.” 

It was true, Webb admitted to 
himself. No longer did he feel the 
least malice toward Cliff. But bit- 
terness was still rank on his tongue. 
“So how does the story end? Does 
boy get girl or not?” 

“Of course. Boy always gets girl, 
if he wants her. It's a long life. At 
this phase she wants me.” 

“Is that your own opinion or 
just another subtotal of the com- 
puter?” 

“Both.” 

“But — ^how does it really end. 
What happens when you punch 
the total key?” 

“You ask that, Webb? You, one 
of the very first to embrace the 
rigors of physical immortality? My 
dear friend, there is no total 
key.” • • •

THE TWILIGHT YEARS 



It was a new era — an era of practicality 
and cruelty, an era for youth ... An era of 
alarm, too, for people who were over sixty . 



S YDNEY MERCER stopped his 
pacing and listened; his head 
tilted expectantly. When he heard 
the elevator stop, he went with 
quick, awkward steps to the apart- 
ment door and opened it just a 
crack. “This time,” he sighed with 
relief, “It’s Eleanor.” He opened 
the door for her. 

His wife breezed down the hall 
and through the open door. She 
dumped her armfiil of packages 
beside her on the couch as she 
kicked off her shoes. “Whew! What 
a relief!” 

Closing the door carefully, Syd- 
ney hurried over to her. “Ellie — 



I’ve been worried. You didn’t tell 
me you were going to be so late. 
And when you didn’t call — 

“Nonsense,” she said gaily. “It’s 
only 6:15. Why, the stores are just 
now starting to board up. And you 
know the “A Cars” don’t start run- 
ning till seven.” She smiled at him. 
“Would you get my slippers, 
honey?” 

He hesitated for a moment, and 
then shuffled into the bedroom. 
Eleanor stood in front of the couch 
flexing her tired toes. She had a 
small and rather dumpy figure 
without her high heels. And though 
her fashionably dressed body was

usually molded into the latest sil- 
houette, now in her more relaxed 
state she frankly looked her sixty- 
one years. 

Sydney came back with her slip- 
pers, and bent to put them on. 
“Thanks, dear, shopping just kills 
my feet. But, enough of this,” she 
sighed, “I’ve got only a few min- 
utes to get dinner ready before 
‘Manhunt’ comes on.” And she 
started for the kitchen. 

He followed and caught her 
heavily by the shoulders, his face 
stern. “Listen, Ellie — I don’t ever 
want you to come home so late that 
you have to take an armored car.” 
He shook her to emphasize his 
statement. 

“But why?” she asked with 
genuine wonder. “They’re safe 
enough. Edith and Ruth often take 
‘A’ cars, and nothing’s ever hap- 
pened to them.” 

He let her go reluctantly. “Ellie,” 
he said gently, “I just want to be 
sure that nothing happens to you, 
that’s all. We’re at such a danger- 
ous age now, with both of us over 
sixty. You’re all I’ve got. I’d be 
so all alone without you.” 

She thrust out her ample chest 
indignantly. “Sydney, the trouble 
with you is that you’re still living 
in the past. You’ve got to keep up 
with the times. Sure, things are 
different now, than they were, say, 
ten years ago. But what of it? If 
life is more dangerous now, it’s 
certainly more thrilling — and more 
intense, too!” 

He eyed her steadily. “What’s so 
thrilling about being sixty plus?” 

“You’ve just got to accept,” she 
continued glibly, as though it had 



81 




been memorized, “the fact that it’s 
a young people’s world, now. Live 
for the day! That should be our 
motto.” She smiled placidly at him. 
“That’s the way I’ve been living 
this past year. As though each day 
was completely separate from the 
one before it — and the one after. In 
a young people’s world — what else 
is there to do?” 

Eleanor patted her husband’s 
cheek, and then looked past him 
into the living room, a shocked 
expression on her face. “Why Syd, 
have you been sitting here all alone 
without the T.V. on? Goodness, 
that’s enough to make anyone start 
thinking! You march right in there 
and turn it on.” 

He turned, with a slight shrug, 
to comply, and Eleanor started to 
fix dinner. The T.V. screen was in 
full view of the kitchen cubicle, of 
course. Apartments had been de- 
signed that way for years now. So, 
she was able to open the few cans 
and containers that constituted 
dinner, with her eyes almost en- 
tirely on the T.V. 

Sydney gave it a glance or two 
as he set the table. But he was too 
preoccupied with his thoughts to 
enjoy the programs as much as he 
usually tried to. He wondered why 
this day to day living didn’t seem 
to be as much fun to him as it did 
to others. He fingered the “Sixty- 
Plus” insignia sewn onto his shirt 
sleeve. To him, it had turned out 
to be merely a matter of waiting. 

Eleanor was fixing a salad, with 
hardly a glance at what she was do- 
ing, so automatically did her fingers 
accomplish their task. He looked at 
her, cheerfully doing what the times 

82 



and fashion decreed, and wished he 
could accept things the way she 
did. He was very fond of her. Now 
that he had been retired, they 
should have had time to enjoy each 
other. But something was wrong. 
Most people tried to have fun while 
they were waiting. Their closest 
friends, Eddie and Jean, seemed to 
be enjoying their retirement period. 
Or were they really, he asked him- 
self, remembering a few times in 
past conversations when the talk 
had verged momentarily in that 
direction, only to break off guiltily. 

They sat down to eat at the table 
in front of the screen, sitting side 
by side, of course, so they wouldn’t 
miss any of the programs during 
dinner. 

Part way through the meal the 
phone rang. Sydney quickly got up 
to answer it. He knew Eleanor 
hated to be disturbed during a 
T.V. program. 

“Hello, Jean,” he said pleasantly, 
recognizing her voice at once. 
“What’s the matter? You sound 
so — ” His lips remained open, un- 
expectedly. Then, he put his hand 
over the mouthpiece of the phone. 

“Ellie!” he called so sharply that 
she turned at once. 

“What is it?” she snapped back 
at him between mouthfuls. 

“It’s Jean. She says Eddie’s gone 
out for ‘fair game’!” His voice 
faded to a whisper. “Good God, 
Ellie. I don’t know what to say to 
her!” 

Eleanor dropped her fork to the 
plate with an air of disgust rising 
to the surface. “Oh, that woman! 
She always did let Eddie worry 
her.” She smiled benignly. “Tell 

KIRK AND GAREN DRUSSAI 




her we’re sorry to hear it, of course. 
But he had only a year to go any- 
way.” 

“But she wants to know what to 
do!” He looked at her pleadingly. 
“She’s acting hysterical. If she de- 
cides to go out herself — 

Eleanor got up and took the 
phone from his shaky hand. He sat 
down on the couch, only distantly 
hearing snatches of what Eleanor 
was saying to Jean, picturing Eddie 
walking down the deserted streets. 
Probably right out in the middle, 
where anyone could see him. 

“No — ^you stay right where you 
are — ^no point in both of you . , . 
Yes, that’s right. I’ve always known 
you had more pride than he did . 
Sure, we’ll be over to see you — ^no, 
not tonight! ... Of course not; 
wait until morning — remember, 
I’m counting on you, Jean.” 

Eleanor finally hung up and, go- 
ing back to the table, finished spear- 
ing the bit of salad she had been 
working on. 

Sydney looked at her, unbeliev- 
ingly. “Ellie, how can you go right 
back to eating after what’s hap- 
pened to Eddie?” 

Her eyes remained on the screen. 
“Why should I feel sorry for him, if 
he didn’t have the guts to wait? I 
just feel sorry for Jean. The shame 
of it! If it had happened some other 
way, it would have been different. 
And Jean hasn’t even got enough 
sense to realize it isn’t ‘fair game’ 
for Eddie. It’s just plain suicide!” 
Eleanor glanced at her husband 
sharply. “What on earth’s got into 
you tonight, Syd! You’re jiunpier 
than I’ve ever seen you.” 

He concentrated, a puzzled look 

THE TWIUGHT YEARS 



on his face. “I don’t know. I never 
thought much about it until today. 
And with Eddie. Everything falls 
into place suddenly, it all seems so 
wrong, so useless.” He looked at her 
intendy as she pushed her empty 
plate away and lit a cigarette. “El- 
lie, doesn’t it strike you as strange 
— almost unbelievable — that we ac- 
cept the concept of longevity as a 
subversive one? Doesn’t it seem — 
well, weird — that we sixty plus-ers 
sit around every night — just wait- 
ing?” 

Eleanor turned innocuous grey 
eyes to him. “Oh, Sydney, you’re 
talking like a silly pup. Let’s pay 
attention to the show.” 

“Some people kill themselves.” 
He muttered, almost savoring the 
words. 

“Oh bosh, don’t say such things!” 
Her voice was tight and angry. 
“Sydney, you wouldn’t shame me 
like that, would you; not like that 
weak-kneed Eddie?” 

“Why not?” he retorted. He was 
beginning to feel ashamed of argu- 
ing with Eleanor but he couldn’t 
stop. “Since my retirement, since 
I became a sixty plus-er, I’ve just 
been sitting around doing nothing. 
I feel like a stupid animal being 
kept in a pen.” He buried his face 
in his hands and sobbed. 

She stroked his head lovingly 
but nevertheless condescendingly. 
“Sydney, there’s so much you could 
be doing, now that you have time 
for it.” 

He raised his head tiredly. “It’s 
too late for that. But — what have 
I missed? Have you got an an- 
swer?” 

“Well,” she looked slightly dis- 

83 




concerted. “What all the others do. 
they play golf, and sunbathe, and 
go to lectures and shows, and 
^ ” Her ingenuity gave out. She 
stole a glance at the T.V. screen. 
“You’ve got to relax, honey, stop 
all this thinking. You know, ‘eat, 
drink, and be merry’ sort of — ” 
He noticed that her attention 
had wandered. He knew why. That 
cold chill in the pit of his stomach 
had told him that it was almost 
time. 

“Do we have to watch it, to- 
night?” Sydney asked her almost 
bitterly. “How can you really sit 
there and enjoy seeing all that vio- 
lence and — ” 

She leaned back comfortably, 
watching the screen. “What else are 
the boys to do? The psychiatrists 
say, that since the war is over, 
pur boys need to drain off their 
energies somehow. Besides, some- 
times it’s really merciful.” She fold- 
ed her arms over her stomach, as 
though to dismiss the subject. 

The screen had darkened. 
There were two young men, dim 
and strange looking, with masks 
over the lower part of their faces. 
And they were making plans — 
in a small, darkened room. Then, 
silently, they left the room, and 
crept through the somber streets. 
The camera followed them faith- 
fully as they slipped cautiously 
from shadow to shadow. 

Sydney foimd himself watching 
the screen now, too. It comp>elled 
him against his will. “I went 
through a war,” he hissed, clench- 
ing his fists tightly. “The Korean 

84 



War — ^when I was young. And 
when it was over I went back to 
work in an office. I didn’t need 
any violence drained out of me! 

“Sshhh,” Eleanor insisted, and 
then relented. “I keep telling you, 
Syd, these boys went through a 
different kind of war than yours. 
They’ve had more taken out of 
them than you had.” She whispered 
it, her eyes never leaving the screen, 
her breath coming in excited gasps. 
“People have just outlived their 
usefcJness, now, by the time they 
are sixty. It’s natural for the young 
folks to resent us, especially if we 
are a burden and there are too 
many of us. You’ve got to adjust, 
Sydney, just adjust to the times.” 

The two men paused at an in- 
tersection — paused for endless 
moments — while millions of peo- 
ple watched, hardly daring to 
breathe. Then slowly and delib- 
erately, with overtly melodra- 
matic malice, they turn a corner, 
and start to run swiftly along the 
street. Of the millions who 
watched — there were some who 
felt a cold clutching within them. 

Sydney leaned forward on the 
couch, his pale eyes almost bulging 
with intentness. The intersection on 
the screen had been familiar. The 
street the cameras were recording 
— was more so. 

Adjust, he thought, I wish it was 
that easy for me. Adjust to the 
times, she says — they all say — there- 
by excusing everything hideous, 
and violent, and disgusting that ex- 
ists in the present. Nobody objects 
to anything. There’s nothing con- 

KIRK AND GAREN DRUSSAI 




structive for individuals anymore. 
They just accept. Adjust to bein» 
idle and useless at sixty, whether I 
like it or not. Adjust to A Gars, the 
boarding up of shops every night, 
not daring to go out after dark. Get 
used to violence and fear, sitting 
in front of this screen as though it 
were an object of worship. Endure 
“Manhunt” every night; not know- 
ing — ^just waiting — ^waiting . 
those of us who live to sixty-five. 

Eleanor cleared her throat and 
then whispered huskily. “They’ve 
been up the same street before.” 
She turned to him, her eyes watery 
with agitation pushed almost to its 
limit. 

He couldn’t help it. All his re- 
sentment was momentarily stilled 
by his affection for her. He smiled. 
“Sure, Ellie. Many times.” Invol- 
untarily, he put his arm around 
her shoulder and squeezed. 

Without warning, the two men 
stopped in front of an apartment 
house. They glanced quickly 
around, and then slipped into 
the building, the camera close 
upon them, 

Sydney took his wife’s hand. 
‘'Why they’ve even been in the very 
same building before.” His face 
felt cold and damp. He added 
resolutely, “It’s a big apartment 
house, Ellie, a real big one.” 

Suddenly he found himself lis- 
tening — listening — ^hardly breath- 
ing. It seemed as though sound 
didn’t exist anymore. There was 
just silence, grotesque and un- 
natural. 

Then he heard it. First there was 



a stealthy shufiling sound coming 
a long ways down the hall. Then 
the slight regular noise of a wheeled 
object, following. 

Sydney saw that she had not 
heard. Her eyes were desperately 
fixed on the screen. It could be, he 
thought chaotically, it could be the 
Masons across the hall. They’re al- 
most sixty-five. 

Then the door knob turned, and 
the door swung silently open. Stiff- 
ly, Sydney turned his head to the 
door. There was time, they saw to 
that. There was time to see the two 
masked men with guns in then- 
hands. And behind them was the 
T.V. camera, registering the scene 
that was duplicated on his own 
screen. There was even time to turn 
to Ellie; to see the look of cheated 
disappointment in her eyes change 
to astonishment as the bullet cut 
cleanly into her open mouth. And 
then there was no more time for 
Sydney Mercer either, who had 
reached the age of sixty plus and 
therefore was past his usefulness. 
Another bullet stopped his intake 
of breath. 

The camera moved in for a 
close up of the two men; their 
lips, beneath the masks, smiling 
and guileless. Then the camera 
hovered for a few moments over 
the ludicrously postured bodies 
on the couch for a fade out. 

“Manhunt” was over for the 
night. The announcer’s voice and 
figure gradually took over the ex- 
panse of the screen. 

“Tonight’s program has been 
(Continued on page 117) 



THE TWILIGHT YEARS 



85 





The Morrisons didn’t lose their freedom. They were merely 
sentenced to the highways for life, never stopping any- 
where, going no place, just driving, driving, driving . 



S OME PEOPLE had disagreed 
with him. They were influential 
people. He was put on the road. 

^ Stan wanted to scream at the big 
sixteen-cylinder Special to go faster. 
But Salt Lake City, where they 
would allow him to stop over for 
the maximum eight hours, was a 
long way off. And anyway, he 
couldn’t go over a hundred. The 
Special had an automatic cut-off. 

He stared down the super ten- 
lane Freeway, down the glassy river 



FREEWAY 



plunging straight across the early 
desert morning — into nowhere. 
That was Anna’s trouble. His wife 
couldn’t just keep travelling, know- 
ing there was no place to go. No one 
could do that. I can’t do it much 
longer either, Stan thought. The 
two of us with no place to go but 
back and forth, across and over, re- 
tracing the same throughways, 
highways, freeways, a thousand 
times round and round like mobile 
bugs caught in a gigantic concrete 
net. 

He kept watching his wife’s white 
face in the rear-view mirror. Now 



there was this bitter veil of resigna- 
tion painted on it. He didn’t know 
when the hysteria would scream 
through again, what she would try 
next, or when. 

She had always been highly emo- 
tional, vital, active, a fighter. The 
Special kept moving, but it was still 
a suffocating cage. She needed to 
stop over somewhere, longer, much 
longer than the maximum eight 
hours. She needed treatment, a 
good long rest, a doctor’s care — 

She might need more than that 
Complete freedom perhaps. She 
had always been an all-or-nothing 
gal. But he couldn’t give her that. 

Shimmering up ahead he saw the 
shack about fifty feet off the Free- 
way, saw the fluttering of colorful 
hand-woven rugs and blankets 
covered with ancient Indian sym- 
bols. 

It wasn’t an authorized stop, but 
he stopped. The car swayed slight- 
ly as he pressed the hydraulic. 

From the bluish haze of the des- 
ert’s tranquil breath a jackrabbit 
hobbled onto the Freeway’s fringe. 
It froze. Then with a squeal it 
scrambled back into the dust to 
escape the thing hurtling toward it 
out of the rising sun. 

Stan jumped out. The dust 
burned. There was a flat heavy vio- 
lence to the blast of morning sun 
on his face. He looked in through 
the rear window of the car. 

“You’ll be okay, honey.” Her 
face was feverish. Sweat stood out 
on her forehead. She didn’t look 
at him. 

“It’s too late,” she said. “We’re 
dead, Stan. Moving all the time. 



87 




But not alive.” 

He turned. The pressure, the 
suppression, the helpless anger was 
in him meeting the heavy hand of 
the sun. An old Indian, wearing 
dirty levis and a denim irfiirt and a 
beaded belt, was standing near him. 
His face was angled, so dark it had 
a bluish tinge. “Blanket? Rugs? 
Hand-made. Real Indian stuff.” 

“My wife’s sick,” Stan said. “She 
needs a doctor. I want to use your 
phone to call a doctor. I can’t leave 
the Freeway — ” 

This was the fourth unauthor- 
ized stop he had made since Anna 
had tried to jump out of the car 
back there — ^when it was going a 
hundred miles an hour. 

The Indian saw the Special’s 
license. He shrugged, then shook 
his head. 

“For God’s sake don’t shake your 
head,” Stan yelled. “Just let me use 
your phone — ” 

The Indian kept on shaking his 
head. There was no emotion, only 
a fatalistic acceptance of the over- 
ly-complex world he and many of 
his kind had rejected long ago. 
“You’re a Crackpot.” 

“But what’s that to you when I 
just want to use your phone? If I 
can get a doctor’s affidavit — ” 

“If I help you, then the Law 
come down on my neck.” 

“But I only want to use the 
phone!” 

“I cannot risk it. You drive on 
now.” 

He felt it, the thing that was 
slowly dying in Anna’s eyes. This 
need to strike out, strike out hard 
and murderously at something real. 
This suppressed feeling had been 

88 



growing in him now for too many 
miles to remember. He started for- 
ward. But the Indian slid the knife 
from his beaded belt. “I am sorry, 
and that is the honest truth,” The 
Indian said. “But you have to 
move on now.” The Indian stepped 
back toward the ancient symbols 
of his kind. “We have stopped mov- 
ing. We stay here now no matter 
what. Now, White Doctor, it is 
your turn to move on.” 

He put his hand over his eyes as 
though to push something down. 
One act of violence, and the ques- 
tionable “freedom” would be end- 
ed. That would be an admission of 
defeat. His hand still over his eyes, 
he backed away. Then he turned, 
choking and half blinded with 
smoldering rage. 

Keep moving. Nothing else to do 
with ffiem but put them on the 
road and keep them moving, never 
letting them stop over long enough 
to cause trouble, to stir up any 
wrong ideas. Hit the road. Crack- 
pot. Head on down the super ten- 
lane Freeway into the second Mid- 
dle Ages lit with neon. 

Then he was running, yelling at 
Anna. She was past the shack and 
stumbling through sand toward the 
moimtains. He coaxed her back 
and into the car, sickness gorging 
his throat as she kicked and 
screamed at him and he forced her 
into the comer of the back seat. 

“Stan, we could run to the 
mountains.” 

“The Law wouldn’t let us get 
very far. Remember, the Special’s 
remotely controlled. If we leave the 
Freeway, they’d be on us in no 
time. Tliey Imow when we stop, 

BRYCE WALTON 




where we stop. They know if we 
leave the Freeway!’* 

“But we would have tried!'* 
“They’re just waiting for us to 
do something legally wrong so they 
can put us away, honey. We can’t 
let ourselves be goaded into doing 
anything legally wrong!” 

“Stan — she was shaking her 
head, and her eyes were wet. “Can’t 
you see, can’t you see? What they 
do to us doesn’t matter now. It’s 
what we do, or don’t do — ” 

When she quieted down a little, 
he got back under the wheel. With- 
in a hundred feet, the Special was 
going eighty-five miles an hour. 



T he thing he had to hold on 
to hard, was the fact that they 
had never really done anything 
wrong. Anna needed a good long 
rest so she could regain Ae proper 
perspective. The Higher Court itself 
had said they hadn’t done anything 
wrong. There were thousands now 
on the Freeways, none of them had 
any real criminal labels on them. 
They were risks. They might be 
dangerous. Attitudes not quite 
right. A little off center one way or 
another at the wrong time. Some 
personal indiscretion in the past. A 
thought not quite orthodox in the 
present. A possible future threat. A 
threat to total security. 

Be careful, easy does it. Too 
many black marks on his road rec- 
ord and the “freedom” of the road 
would go. Then he would be a 
criminal in fact, instead of a vague 
criminal possibility, and put behind 
bars. Or worse. 

The hell with them. The heU 



with them all. He pulled over onto 
an emergency siding and stopped. 
Not authorized. A good long rest 
and talk with Anna — 

Then he saw it. Suddenly, fran- 
tically, he wanted to move on. But 
now he couldn’t. He kept seeing 
the light of defiance fading from 
Anna’s eyes. 

The Patrolcar was there, the way 
it always was there, suddenly, ma- 
terializing out of the desert, or out 
of a mountain, a side street. Some- 
times it was a helio dropping out of 
the sky. Sometimes it was a light 
Hashing in darkness. 

Every official of the law: city, 
county, state, or federal, had a full 
record on every Special. They 
could control them at will. Stop 
them, start them, keep them mov- 
ing down the line. 

Jails of the open road. Mobility 
lending to incarceration a mock 
illusion of freedom. Open sky. 
Open prairie. The Freeway stretch- 
ing ahead. 

And the Patrolcar coming up 
behind. 

The Patrolcar stopped. The two 
Patrolmen in black and gold imi- 
forms looked in at Stan. “Well, 
egghead,” the older, beefy one said. 
“It was nice of you to stop without 
being asked. A fellow named Fer- 
ret! back at Snappy Service No. 7 
said you might be a trouble-maker. 
We thought we ought to check 
up.” 

Stan said, “I wanted to use his 
phone to try to get a doctor to ex- 
amine my vidfe. She’s ill. She needs 
help and I’ve been trying — ” 

Without turning, the older Pa- 
trolman interrupted, “Larry, what 

89 



FREEWAY 




you got on the philosopher here?” 
The younger Patrolman who 
had a shy, almost embtoassed air 
about him looked into his black 
notebook. “He isn’t a philosopher, 
not officially, Leland. Every Crack- 
pot we stop, you figure him to be a 
philosopher. You just hate philoso- 
phers that’s all.” 

“Well, that’s a fact, boy.” When 
he took the cigar out of his mouth, 
the corners of his mouth were 
stained brown. “My kid got loused 
up plenty by a philosopher in High 
School last year. I raised a squawk 
and got the Crackpot kicked out. I 
also got three others booted out for 
hiring him in the first place. I 
found out he was a lousy atheist!” 
The Patrolman put the cigar 
back into his mouth. “What have 
you got on him, Lieutenant?” 
“Stanley L. Morrison, B.A. 
Drake University, Class of ’55.

employment, January, 1959 — ” 
“What for. Lieutenant?” 

“For excessive political enthu- 
siasm for the preceding political 
party in office.” The Lieutenant 
looked up almost apologetically. 
“Looks like he was unfortunate 
enough to have been on the wrong 
side of the fence when the Inde- 
pendants were elected.” 

“These guys are dangerous no 
matter what side they’re on. A 
Crackpot shouldn’t be on either 
side. Well, Lieutenant, what else?” 
“Professor of Nuclear Physics, 
Drake University, 1960-62. Dis- 
missed by Board of Regents May 
31, charged with ‘private thought

inconsistent with the policies of the 
University’. Special inquiry August 
5. Dismissal sustained. Was put on 
the road as a permanent risk to 
security February 3, 1963. He’s 
been on the roads for a year and 
three months.” 

Stan forced quiet into his voice. 
“My wife’s sick. If I could get a 
doctor to examine her. I’m sure I 
could get a permit to lay over some- 
where so she can get rest and 
proper treatment.” 

“Only eight hours,” the beefy 
one said. “That’s the limit. And 
you’re not supposed to have 
stopped here at all. Or back at the 
Indian’s.” 

“I know,” Stan said. “But this is 
an emergency. If you could help 
me — ” 

The beefy one grinned into the 
back seat. “That might be all that’s 
bothering the missus, egghead. She 
ain’t getting the proper treatment 
maybe.” 

Easy, easy does it. In the rear- 
view mirror he could see that what 
the Patrolman said had brought a 
flush of life to her face. She was 
rigid now, and then suddenly she 
screamed. “Stan! For God’s sake, 
Stan, don’t take any more from the 
simian!” 

“Let’s go,” the young Lieutenant 
said quickly. “We’ve got the report 
and we’ll forward it. There’s no 
call to bait them.” 

“Shut up,” the beefy one said. 

“Don’t tell me to shut up,” the 
Lieutenant said. He put his note- 
book away. “This man’s never 
committed any crime. That’s why 
he’s on the road. They didn’t know 
what else to do with him. We’re 

BRYCE WALTON 




supposed to keep them moving 
that’s all. Not hold them up be- 
cause of personal vindictiveness.” 

The beefy one’s face was getting 
red. “Don’t use your big words on 
me, boy. I’ll send you back to Col- 
lege.” 

“He’s getting punishment enough. 
You’ve got nothing against him, or 
the woman.” 

The beefy one took a deep 
breath. “Okay, Lieutenant. But 
I’m going to drop a few words in 
the right place. I guess you know 
how the Commissioner feels about 
Crackpots.” 

“I don’t give a damn. Come on, 
let’s get out of here,” The Lieu- 
tenant looked at Stan a moment. 
“You’d better move on. Doctor.” 

“Thanks,” Stan said. 

“At the next Snappy Service 
maybe you can phone. That’s an 
hour’s authorized stop for Specials. 
There’s a Government Project 
in the hills nearby. You might be 
able to contact a Doctor there.” 



T he sage spread out to a blur. 

Heat wavered up from the 
Freeway. In the rear-view mirror 
he saw Anna leaning back, her legs 
stretched out, her arms limp at her 
sides. She wasn’t thinking about 
this with an historical perspective, 
that was the trouble. She had lost 
the saving sense of continuity with 
generations gone, which stretched 
Uke a lifeline across the frighten- 
ing present. 

Keep the perspective. Wait it 
out. T^at was the only way. This 
was an historical phase, part of a 
cycle. Stan couldn’t blame any one. 

FREEWAY 



Anxiety, suspicion of intellectuals 
and men of science — as though 
they had been any more responsi- 
ble really than any one else — sus- 
picion and fear. There always had 
to be whipping boys. In one form 
or another, he knew, it had hap- 
pened many times before. Another 
time of change and danger. There 
was a quicksand of fear under 
men’s reasoning. 

When things were better, they 
hadn’t remained better. When they 
were bad, they couldn’t stay bad. 
Wait it out. One thing he knew — 
neither he nor any other scientist 
could detach himself from life. The 
frightened policemen of the public 
conscience had made the mistake 
of thinking they could detach the 
scientist. 

ril not withdraw from it. All of 
it represents a necessary change. 
If not for the immediate better, 
then ril be here for the immediate 
worst which will someday change 
into something better than ever. 

But Anna’s tired voice was whis- 
pering in his ear. “First of all, we’re 
individuals, men, women. We’ve 
got to fight, fight back!” 

“At what? Ourselves?” 

A sign said: hal’s snappy 

SERVICE. TW^ENTY-SEVEN MILES. 

She’s right, he thought, and 
started slowing down. This is it. He 
wasn’t going any farther until Anna 
was examined, and he was given an 
okay to stop somewhere so she 
could rest. 

It was a dusty oasis, an arid 
anachronism on ihe desert’s edge. 
Beyond it, the mountains blun- 
dered up like giants from a pur- 

91 




plish haze, brooding and somehow 
threatening. Groves of cottonwoods 
could be seen far ahead, and 
sprinklings of green reaching into 
the thinning sage. 

The old man shuffled out of the 
shade by the coke machine. Be- 
hind him, through dusty glass, 
Stan saw the blurred faces staring 
with still curiosity. 

The old man hesitated, then 
came around between the pumps 
to the driver’s side. He was all 
stooped bone and leathery skin. His 
face, Stan thought beneath the ris- 
ing desperation, resembled an Afri- 
can ceremonial mask. 

To the left a ’62 Fordster was 
cranked up for a grease job. But 
the only life around it was a 
scrawny dog lying out flat to get 
all the air possible on its ribby body, 
its tongue hanging out in the black 
grease. 

“The car’s okay,” Stan said. “I 
just want to use your telephone.” 

“Doctor Morrison, you’d better 
go on to Salt Lake City. That’s an 
eight-hour stopover.” 

“My wife needs a doctor’s okay 
for a long rest. I can’t take a 
chance on going clear to Salt Lake 
City.” 

“But this is only an hour stop.” 

Stan got out and shoved past the 
old man. Heat waves shivered up 
out of the concrete and through 
the soles of his shoes. The heat 
seared his dry throat and burned 
his lungs. 

Anna wasn’t even looking. She 
seemed to have forgotten him. Al- 
most everyone had forgotten him 
by now, he thought, forgotten Doc- 
tor Stanley Morrison the man who 

92 



had never been afraid to speak out 
and say what he thought, and think 
what he wanted to think. Fifteen 
months with never more than an 
eight hour stopover. Thought and 
self-regard frozen by perpetual mo- 
tion, and shriveled by consequent 
neglect. Only the old man remem- 
bered. That was odd. 

A man stepped into the door- 
way. He was lean and powerful 
with a long gaunt chewing jaw like 
that of a horse. His eyes were small 
and black, and he was grinning 
with anticipation. Stan felt his 
stomach muscles tighten. 

Behind the man, Stan saw the 
kid. Almost as tall as the man who 
was obviously his father, but rail- 
thin, like an emaciated duplicate 
of the man, a starved, frustrated 
shadow, grinning and feverishly 
picking at a pimple under his left 
ear. He carried a grease-gun 
cradled in his left arm as though it 
were a machine gun. 

“I’d like to use your phone, 
please,” Stan said. “My wife’s ill. I 
want to phone the Government 
Project and see if I can get a doc- 
tor over here to look at her.” 
“What seems to be troubling the 
missus?” 

“I don’t know!” 

“Then how do you know it’s a 
serious sickness, Crackpot?” 

“Just let me use the phone? Will 
you do that?” 

“They phoned in ahead, Crack- 
pot. Said you might be a trouble- 
maker.” 

“I don’t want to make any trou- 
ble. I just want to use the phone!” 
“Why? Even if the Doc came 
over, you wouldn’t be here. He 

BRYCE WALTON 




can’t get here inside an hour. And 
that’s all the longer you can stay 
here. You got to move on.” 

“I’m coming in to use the 
phone,” Stan heard himself saying. 
He fought to keep the breathiness 
out of his voice, the trembling out 
of his throat. 

“I don’t guess I’d want to have 
it said I was coddling a Crackpot.” 
“I never caused you any trouble.” 
“You helped build hellbombs,” 
the man said. He took the tooth- 
pick out of his mouth. “You crazy 
bastards got to be kept moving 
along the road.” 

“How do you know what I did 
or didn’t do?” 

“You’re a Crackpot.” 

“I never helped build any kind 
of bomb,” Stan whispered. “But 
even if I did — ” 

“You’re one of them nuclear 
physicists.” 

“I was an instructor at a Uni- 
versity. I taught at a Government 
school once too — ^for a while — ” 
He stopped himself, realizing he 
was defending himself as though 
somehow he suspected his own 
guilt. 

“You taught other guys how to 
build hellbombs. Who needs you 
and your kind. Crackpot? We need 
your brains like we need a knife 
in the back.” 

Stan lunged forward. The kid 
yelled somediing in a high cracked 
voice as Stan lashed out again. He 
felt his knuckles scrape across hard 
teeth. Blood leaped from the man’s 
upper lip in a thin crimson slash. 
His eyes widened with a grudging 
respect, then he snarled through 
the blood as he stumbled backward 



and off balance. He fell against the 
window and trying to regain his 
balance, reeled and went down in 
a welter of empty gallon oil cans. 

He gathered himself for an up- 
ward lunge. Through the blood 
staining his teeth, he muttered, 
“By gawd. Crackpot. I didn’t think 
you had the guts!” 

Stan glanced out the window 
and saw that Anna was gone from 
the car. 

Dimly, he heard the man saying 
he was going to beat hell out of the 
Crackpot, going to beat the Crack- 
pot over die head and then the 
Crackpot wouldn’t be able to cook 
up any more dangerous ideas in it 
for a long, long time. 

Anna may die now, Stan thought 
as he stood there bent over a little, 
feeling his wet fists tightening. She 
may die now, because of a frus- 
trated fool who doesn’t know what 
else to do with himself on a hot and 
dull and empty afternoon. 

Stan suddenly caught the flash 
of color out of the comer of his eye. 
He twisted, not thinking at all, and 
felt his fist sink into the kid’s stom- 
ach. The kid fell, curled up among 
the empty oil cans. He writhed 
and moaned and held his stomach. 

“Get up, “Stan yelled into the 
man’s face. “Get up — ” 

The man came up all at once, 
and his weight hurled Stan clear 
across the room. He felt the gum 
machine shatter under him, and 
the metal grinding into his side as 
he rolled. Stan felt the grease-gim 
in his hand as he saw the man lift- 
ing the tire tool, and then Stan 
swung the grease gun into the face, 
seeing the terrible grin, the blood- 

93 



FREEWAY 




stained white smile. 

Unrecognizable as it was, the 
mans’ face wouldn’t go away. Stan 
swung at it again. Then he heard 
her voice, Anna’s voice, intense 
and alive, and there was a flash of 
Anna the way he remembered her 
a thousand vears ago, before they 
were put on the road. She was tear- 
ing at the man’s face with her fin- 
gernails and kicking him savagely. 

Stan had the man’s shirt collar 
and it was ripping under his fingers 
as he slammed the head against 
the concrete floor. The thudding 
rhythm was coming up through his 
arm and throbbing behind his eyes. 

Like drums, he thought as a sick- 
ening light flashed on the dusty 
glass, like primitive war drums 
beating out a dance of tribal doom. 

Suddenly feeling sick and weak, 
he stood up and walked stiffly out 
into the sun. 

He leaned against the side of 
the building trying to keep from 
retching. Anna touched his arm 
and he looked up, half blinded by 
the glare of the sun. Her face was 
flushed and alive. She seemed ten 
years younger. 

“Don’t be sorry,” she said. “Be 
glad, Stan.” 

“They broke us,” he whispered. 
“We’ve crawled into the cage.” 

“It doesn’t matter, Stan, it 
doesn’t matter what they do to us 
now! It’s something to admit you’re 
human, isn’t it?” 

She was partly right at least. He 
felt both glad and sad. But in either 
case, it was the end of the road. 

He saw the old man lowering the 
hood of the Special. He ran back 
between the pumps carrying a 

94 



metal tool box. “I’ve fixed it,” he 
said, breathing heavily. “Now get 
out of here. Push it to the limit. I 
broke the cut-off too. Hurry it up!” 
“But what’s the use?” Stan said. 
“They’ll get us sooner or later — ” 
“They’re not going to get you 
now, not if you stop reasoning 
ever^hing out as though it were a 
problem in calculus! I’ve cut the 
remote control off, and the radar 
and radio. They won’t know where 
you are. I’ve changed the license 
plate too. But hurry out of here 
before Hal or his kid start phon- 
ing.” 

“But being on the Freeway,” ' 
Stan said, “they’ll catch up with 
us! What’s the use — ” 

“Stan!” Anna said sharply. 
“Can’t you see? We’re getting 
away!” 

“I don’t want to run away from 
it,” Stan said. 

“You’re not running away from 
anything,” the old man said. 
“You’ll find out. Follow my direc- 
tions and you’ll find out. You’re not 
running away. You can get out of 
the flood water for a while, sit on 
the bank, until the water drops and 
clears a little.” 

Stan looked into the old man’s 
face a long moment. “Who the hell 
are you anyway?” 

“That doesn’t matter. Doctor 
Morrison. Now will you get out of 
here! Move on down the road!” 
Stan finally nodded and took 
Anna’s arm and they started to- 
ward the Special. “All right, but 
what about you?” he asked the old 
man. 

“I’ll make out. You just be con- 
cerned about yourself. Doctor Mor- 

BRYCE WALTON 




rison. This isn’t the first time I’ve 
helped someone off the road. It 
won’t be the last time either, I 
hope.” 

He waved to them as the Spe- 
cial, without any limit to its speed 
now except the limitations of a 
driver’s nerve, roared away toward 
the moun tains . 



OW THE SPECIAL became 
anonymous on the Freeway, 
one of countless cars hurtling down 
the super ten-lane Freeway, its li- 
cense changed, its controls and 
checkers cut off, its sovereignty re- 
turned to it by a nameless old man, 
a box of wrenches, and a roll of 
wire. 

Three hundred miles farther on, 
the Freeway began a long banked 
curve; a thick wall of cottonwoods, 
willows and smaller brush lined the 
side where a creek rushed out of a 
cleft in the lower hills and ran 
along the Freeway’s edge. 

Stan started to slow down. 

‘‘There, that’s it!” Anna said, 
pointing excitedly. “The big rock, 
the three tall trees. There, between 
the rock and the tree. Turn, Stan. 
Tumr^ 

“But there isn’t any road. There 
isn’t—” 

^Turnr 

Stan turned. 

He blinked as the Special roared 
off the Freeway and smashed 
through a solid wall of leaves, 
branches and brush. Then they 
were on a narrow winding dirt 
road, dipping down into the stream 
where a foot of water ran over 
stones to create a fiord. It twisted 

FREEWAY 



up the other side, around the 
creek’s edge, over stones and gravel, 
twisting tortuously upward and out 
of sight like a coiled rope. 

“Go on, Stan, keep going!” 

Stan kept going. It demanded 
all his power of concentration just 
to stay on the road which was hard- 
ly more than a pathway through 
the rising mountains. He had no 
time to think, and had very little to 
say. 

Some hundred and fifty miles 
farther into the mountains, at an 
altitude that bit into their lungs, 
they saw the marker almost buried 
in rocks at the left of the road. 
The place where the old man had 
told them to stop and wait. 

But they didn’t have to wait. A 
man, lean and healthy for his age — 
which must have been at least 
sixty, Stan thought — ^stepped from 
behind a rock, and came toward 
the Special. He was smiling and 
he extended his hand. 

“Doctor and Mrs. Morrison,” he 
said. Anna was already out of the 
car, shaking his hand. Stan got out. 
He took a second look, then whis- 
pered: “Doctor Bergmann!” 

The man wore levis and a 
mackinaw, and he carried a rifle 
slung under one arm. “I wasn’t ex- 
pecting you to recognize me,” he 
said as they shook hands. “I’ve lost 
about thirty-five pounds.” He 
smiled again. “It’s healthier up 
here.” 

He walked around to the driver’s 
side and opened the door. The mo- 
tor was still running. Stan realized 
then what Bergmann was doing, 
and for some reason without defi- 
nition he started to protest. Berg- 

95 





mann was setting the automatic 
clutch and releasing the brake. The 
Special started moving up the road, 
but there was no one inside to turn 
the wheel when it reached the 
hairpin turn about fifty feet ahead. 

Stan watched the car gaining 
speed, its left door swinging like 
the door in a vacant house. He 
thought of stories he had heard 
about convicts finally released after 
many years, stunned, frightened by 
reality, begging to be returned to 
the restricted but understandable 
cell. Then he smiled. Anna smiled. 

The Special, once you pushed 
the right button, could do almost 
everything by itself, feed itself gas, 
gain speed, shift its gears; but it 
didn’t know when to turn to avoid 
self-destruction. 

Stan winced slightly as the car 
lurched a little and then leaped 
out into space. He felt the black 
void opening under him as though 
he were still in the Special. Fifteen 
months. 

His ears were filled with the sud- 
den screeching whine of the wheels 
against unresisting air, then the 
world seemed to burst with a 
thundering series of solid smashing 
roars which were quickly dissipated 
in the high mountain air. 

Doctor Bergmann went over to 
the edge and looked down. “That’s 
the tenth one,” he said. “We’re go- 
ing to send a work party down 
there in a few days to cover it all 
over with rocks. Still, I doubt if we 
have to worry about them spotting 
the wreckage.” 

He turned. “Well, let’s start hik- 
ing. It’s still a few miles.” 

“Where,” Stan asked. “I’ve gone 



along this far. I’ve had no choice. 
But now what’s it all about?” 
“Didn’t the old man tell you?” 
“No.” 

“Just remember, Morrison. We’re 
not running away. This is an old 
Mormon trail. A lot of the old pi- 
oneers took it. That marker says 
that the Williams-Gonner Party 
camped here and was massacred 
by Indians in 1867. There’s an old 
Indian city at about three thousand 
feet. I guess we’re the first ones to 
use it for maybe a thousand years. 
We’ve got an archeologist up there 
— Michael Hilliard — who’s been 
going slightly crazy. Anyway, we’ve 
got books up there, we raise most of 
our own food, and we’ve plenty of 
time to study and try to figure out 
where we made the big mistakes. 
We’re really doing very well.” 

“But what about the old man?” 
Anna asked. 

Bergmann chuckled. “Arch has 
turned into a regular man of a 
thousand faces. He works along the 
Freeways and watches for those 
who are at the breaking point and 
can’t stay on the road any longer. 
Some of those condemned to the 
Freeways are criminals, others are 
fools or misguided zealots; and 
we’ve got to be careful not to wise 
those birds up by mistake. Arch 
has an unerring instinct, and send- 
ing our people to us is his job.” 
The three of them started walk- 
ing up the old pioneer trail. 

“We made a lot of mistakes,” 
Bergmann said. “All of us, some 
more than others. You can’t blame 
people for being afraid, suspicious 
of us. We did unleash the poten- 
tialities for total destruction with-

FORCED 

MOVE 

BY HENRY LEE 

S NOW had fallen in the morn- 
ing but now the sky was clear 
and Ruy, with a glance at the 
frosty stars and a sharp twist of his 
foot as he ground out a cigarette, 
stepped out quickly. It was axio- 
matic. What had to be done, had 
to be done. A forged pass, with 48 
hours of alleged validity gleaming 
brightly in red letters under the 
plastic overlaminate was better 
than no pass. And an outdated pass 
would wipe away a week’s work in 
the underground.

The sharp, massive gray outline 
of the Pentagon loomed before 
him, dark and foreboding against 
the sky. The brightly lighted en- 
trance through which he must gain 
admittance resembled the glowing 
peep-hole into the inferno of an 
atomic drive. 

Ruy’s stomach hardened, then 
exploded in a surge of bitter, strin- 
gent gastric juices as the MP 
glanced at his pass, scrutinized his 
face, and then turned his attention 
toward others coming through the 
entrance. 

Ruy wanted to run and hide. His 
dark blue uniform seemed to shrink 
tighter and tighter. The misfit must 
be apparent from the back. The 
silvery commander’s insignia on his 
jacket weighed heavily at his chest 
and at his heart. He wished des- 
perately for one fleeting, but ex- 
cruciating, moment that he were 
back on his ship, in his own uni- 
form, at the control panel of his 
computer. 

He started off to the right in a 
seeming trance. The first step had 
been taken. His many hours of 
thought, study and planning would 
carry him from here. 

This was the only way. He had 
repeated the fact over and over. It 
was an ugly business, but had to 
be done. Five years of war was 
enough, Man was on his knees be- 
fore the invaders from outer space; 
but they in turn had been too long 
from home and were near the 
breaking point. A continued drain 
would mean defeat for both sides. 
Ruy could turn the tide, but very 
probably his life would be the 
minimum sacrifice. 



He had decided his fate long be- 
fore he left the decks of his ship. 
Only the belligerent pride of states- 
men, and the steadfast belief in the 
infallability of their computers, 
kept the two great battle fleets 
drawn in null position against each 
other. The computers, perhaps, de- 
served such ultimate confidence — 
in theory. They always predicted 
optimum maneuver envelopes, al- 
ways predicted mobilization rates 
to develop force fields designed to 
offset those of the enemy. And they 
always kept battle losses to a mini- 
mum — ^merely dribbling away the 
resources of the solar system. Yet 
in five years of such optimum ma- 
neuvering, not a single battle had 
been won. 

Two doors gave way before 
Ruy’s pocket vibrator, the lock 
tumblers slipping and turning free- 
ly in a mad frenzy to escape the 
resonating hum. A short, window- 
less corridor lay before him, broken 
only by a massive door at the other 
end. Beyond that door lay Ruy’s 
objective. 

The guard never had time to 
do more than note Ruy’s presence 
in this sanctum sanctorum. The 
needle thin spray of a paralyzing 
drug made his body feel stiff, im- 
manageable, and peculiarly buoy- 
ant, as though he were being 
hurled through space. His thoughts 
became blurred and then after a 
blinding flash, complete oblivion 
set in. 

The two officers seated at the 
control panels of the master com- 
puter experienced similar depres- 
sion of their cardiovascular sys- 
tems and medullae. 



99 




Small thermite igniters pressed 
against the door lock and hinges 
fused the steel door to its frame. 

With the smell of scorched paint 
still stinging his nostrils, Ruy 
seated himself at the control panel, 
dabbed his left wrist with stringent 
antiseptic, gripped his hand into a 
fist, and plunged the silver probes 
deep into the nerves of his wrist. 

Glancing through the observa- 
tion window into the battle plot- 
ting room below, he studied the 
positions of the ^ets as they ap- 
peared on the large wall diagram 
of the solar system. 

Disregarding the distraction of- 
fered by the moving figures of the 
few officers and technicians on 
duty by the map, he fixed the posi- 
tions of the fleets into his mind. He 
would have need for a clear visual 
picture until he adapted to the 
mental images the computer would 
feed into his brain. He worked 
with furious haste, yet each step 
was meticulously precise — every- 
thing depended on his grasping the 
reins of battle from the computer 
and successfully twisting its author- 
ity to his own purjx>ses. 

Grasping the viewing switch, he 
threw it on. Pinpoints of light 
flared deep within his brain and 
seemed to blot his vision. Closing 
his eyes, his brain fought for per- 
spective. Gradually, it focused and 
perceived the solar system; re- 
splendent with sun, planets, moons, 
and men of war. Enveloping each 
ship were lines of force, scintillat- 
ing sharp and hard; forming cos- 
mic vortexes as the lesser compu- 
ters on board followed the master’s 
directives and distorted the ether 



around the ships, seeking to build 
a pattern to penetrate the opposing 
fields and engulf the enemy men 
of war. 

A moment, and the game was 
on. Ruy grasped the “Manual” 
switch before him, pulled hard, 
and dropped his hands to the key- 
board before him. 



T he general, who was 

known in military circles as a 
good Joe, but a stickler for the 
theory of war, relaxed languidly at 
his desk in the small office off the 
Battle Room. The other officers on 
duty milled around the plotting 
board within his eyesight awaiting 
the end of the evening shift. 

It was strange and new to relax 
on the job after so many years of 
fleet duty. But staff duty to the 
master computer was good, politi- 
cally. He was getting along in 
years, and a few more contacts 
here might mean a separate fleet 
command of his own, perhaps in 
pursuit of the invader, if the com- 
puters could ever break the dead- 
lock. 

Suddenly, the sweet reverie of 
the General was snapped like a 
tight tension cable. A gong on the 
wall clanged rapidly three times 
and a red flashing light next to the 
gong told him what his ears re- 
fused to believe. The computer had 
been switched to manual. He had 
received no such instructions. In 
fact, the computer hadn’t been on 
manual since the war started. 

“Captain, who ordered manual 
control?” he barked as he sprang 
to the doorway of the Battle Room.

HENRY LEE 




“I don’t know, Sir,” stammered 
the Captain. His manner and bear- 
ing were those of a man who had 
just been faced with a problem of 
cataclysmic proportions. 

“Well check with the control 
room — on the double — ^before our 
fleet gets out of defensive position.” 
His parade ground roar snapped 
the Captain out of the catelepsy 
which had enveloped him and sent 
him scurrying into the corridor. 

An almost hysterical shout 
whirled the General back to the 
plotting board. 

“Sir, our fleet is attacking — 
attacking! 

“What? Where?” asked the Gen- 
eral, his eyes darting over the 
board in a frantic effort to orient 
himself. 

“Here, Sir, see. The positions are 
changing gradually in an unusual 
pattern. A patrol ship, a destroyer, 
and a cruiser have all gone right 
into the enemy vortex field,” an- 
alyzed the Major. 

“Yes, I see — But with the enemy 
concentrating his ships orthogo- 
nally — She’ll build a vortex that will 
disintegrate each and every ship of 
ours near the vortex,” said the 
General, his mind coming up to 
full battle speed as it grasped the 
situation. “My God! Can’t they 
see that they’re going to certain 
death?” 

A gong sounded in a muffled 
sort of way in the plotting room 
below Ruy, as a gentle buzz told 
him that the computer had relin- 
quished control. 

His fingers began to play rapidly 
over the keys. Swift orders of 

FORGED MOVE 



strategy were transmitted through 
steel conduits deep into the com- 
puter vaults of the building. There, 
the orders were transposed into de- 
tailed tactics and beamed through- 
out the solar system. And as his 
fingers limbered to the keys, he 
played a deadly tune, a concerto of 
death. 

The fleet grew alive with a sud- 
den awareness; it seemed to be a 
thing alive, straining at its bonds 
in response to the music played 
into its computers and controls. 
Suddenly, the fleet sprang forward. 
A destroyer shot out into the midst 
of the enemy fleet, launching all of 
its energy in one tremendous lurch 
— only to go down in a flaming 
wreck as the enemy ships swerved 
and concentrated on it. And a sec- 
ond ship, and then a third ship 
repeated the frightful maneuver, 
until the whole heavens were 
lighted with the flaming novae of 
berserk atomic drives. 

“General, sir,” said the Lieuten- 
ant, with sweat rolling from his 
brow as he saluted. 

“Yes, Lieutenant,” said the Gen- 
eral looking away from the battle 
map of the solar system. 

“We can’t make any headway 
against the control room door. 
Must be solid steel. Whoever got in 
there must have fused it shut.” 

“Well, get a welding torch,” said 
the General, his eyes going back to 
watch the devastation of the fleet. 
“We’ve got to get in — get that 
computer back on automatic. Get 
explosives, if necessary.” 

“We’ve sent for a welding 
torch already, sir. It’ll be here in 
a few minutes.” 



101 




“All right. Send someone for 
hand grenades too. WeVe got to 
stop this sabotage before the fleet 
is annihilated. They’re losing ships 
every minute,” 

“Sir,” interposed the Captain 
standing nearby, “maybe we can 
cut off the computer room some- 
way. I know it’s a direct conduit, 
right to the vaults from the control 
room, but maybe we can cut the 
conduits and let the ships fall back 
on their emergency circuits,” 
“Looks like a possible alterna- 
tive, Captain, though we’d put the 
computer out of operation for sev- 
eral days,” said the General. “But 
we’re losing our fleet this way.” 
Seven, eight, nine great men of 
war went down before the blazing 
force fields of the enemy, who 
pounced on every sacrifice offered 
to it by the computer. 

The Lieutenant turned his eyes 
from the incandescent glare of the 
thick steel conduit glowing red un- 
der the finger of the acetylene 
torch. “General, its extremely re- 
sistant to cutting. I doubt if we can 
cut through it before they finally 
get the door and frame cut away 
up in the control room.” 

“Keep at it, boy. We’ve got to 
get through at the saboteur one 
way or another. Do the best you 
can. The boys in the fleet are 
counting on you. They’re going 
down to certain death while we 
delay.” 



ITH THE last terms of the 
new equations of strategy 
played into the computer, Ruy sat 
back, gave a sigh, opened his eyes, 

102 



and slipped the electrodes from his 
wrist. His job was almost done. If 
he could keep the others from this 
control panel for another half hour, 
the computer could operate on his 
equations fully, and the battle 
would be won. 

The first ships from Earth had 
already gone down in flames, ex- 
pendable sacrifices to his purpose. 
But they were not dying in vain. 
The end result would be— must be 
— ^victory. 

Wars are fought by strategy, hut 
also by sacrifice. Every general 
must send troops into battle, must 
expect to sacrifice to make the en- 
emy commit himself in the desired 
way, and so make victory possible. 

This was what Ruy believed. He 
believed it deeply, deeply enough 
to throw aside his career as a ris- 
ing young theoretical mathematics 
officer of the fleet and to go over 
the heads of his unconvinced su- 
periors, with all their unread re- 
ports and unanswered recom- 
mendations from subordinates, in 
the only way a man of action could 
— by taking things into his own 
hands, and staking his life on the 
gamble. 

The General, eyes riveted to the 
board, winced with pain as ship 
after ship roiled the heavens with 
flaming death. And as he watched, 
a gradual subtle design became 
apparent. For every ship he had 
lost, his ships had taken a similar 
tally — ^for each sacrifice, a trap was 
sprung and a similar toll taken. 
Computers did not sacrifice, did 
not send men out to certain death. 
Therefore a sacrifice was greedily 
snapped up as a mistake of the 

HENRY LEE 





enemy. And such greed snapped 
the trap. One move forced the 
next, once the bait was taken. 

As the theme of the theory 
formed in the General’s mind, he 
suddenly muttered : “Even ex- 

change will balance a computer’s 
potential — ^but a series of forced, 
even-exchanges can distort a fleet’s 
position from optimiun ... I never 
realized it before — an optimum 
move is not an optimum move — if 
it’s a forced move.” 

He turned from the board and 
spoke quietly to the men who stood 
in hushed groups watching the 
flaming battle. 

“Gentlemen, we are winning a 



great victory; the war will soon be 
over.” 

The door to the computer room 
toppled outward, frame and all, 
after several ceaseless hours of cut- 
ting. The impact left the hallway 
of armed men silent and still, like 
specters in the unreal light from 
the glowing acetylene torch. Just 
inside the doorway stood a man, 
his youth belied by wise and 
thoughtful eyes, grinding a ciga- 
rette under his foot. And as he 
stepped through the wrecked and 
twisted door frame not a hand was 
raised against him. • • •

the race of mankind. What did it 
matter that it was conceived with- 
out love and emotion. What did it 
matter that she was being used as 
an experiment ... if this child 
within her could fulfill the promise. 

Miryam spat the soft capsule be- 
tween her quivering lips. She 
watched it roll and bounce across 
the polished tile floor, toward the 
door. 

Pain returned, and its fire was 
warm. There were no shadows on 
the wall. Pain returned, and it had 
purpose and promise. Wondering- 
ly, she beheld the concept that sci- 
ence, too, lived with fear, each 
science in its own Ghetto. And if 
the young doctor was right, if 
psi. 

As the doctor stepped into the 
FORGED MOVE 



room, he bent over and picked up 
the red capsule. His thumb and 
forefinger felt the warmth, the 
moisture, and he looked long and 
thoughtfully into Miryam’ s dark, 
glowing eyes. 

His fingers shook as he wrapped 
the capsule in a piece of tissue 
and dropped it into the pocket of 
his white jacket. He picked up the 
chart from the foot of the bed. 

“Miryam — His voice was not 
under complete control, and he 
began again, with an effort at light- 
ness. “Miryam — that’s a strange 
name. What does it mean?” 

“It is an ancient spelling,” she 
whispered, her eyes deep and dark, 
filled with pain and wonder. “You 
may find it easier to call me — 
Mary.” # • •

Deception can be good or bad, depending on how you look at 
it and on the circumstances. Dorav and Tzal had the right way 
of looking at it, and the circumstances were undoubtedly prime.

G radually he became aware 
of resilient rubber and plastic 
supporting him. He lay on his back, 
heels together and toes lopped out- 
ward, elbows crowding uncomfort- 
ably into his ribs. His body shifted. 
The month-long hibernation was 
over. 

A delicious feeling of complete- 
ness — of achievement — swept over 
him. He, Dorav Brink, had escaped 
from the endless boredom and idle- 
ness of Earth’s mechanized domes, 



after all. Here on SuUe II there 
would be adventure and work in 
plenty. 

His eyes opened. In the soft yel- 
lowish light which flooded the small 
square room, he saw a dozen other 
couches, similar to that on which he 
lay. Most of them were occupied. 
His gaze probed the huddled figures 
searching for the girl Rea. 

He had met her aboard the space 
lighter enroute to the interstellar 
liner that was to carry them to SuUe 

104 




II. Then they had been given their 
preliminary capsules of iberno and 
he remembered no more. 

Ihemo hits some people that way 
— with others it takes five or six 
capsules to put them into the death- 
like cataleptic state required for star 
hopping . 

He saw her! Third couch to the 
right of his own. He stood up care- 
fully, balancing on rubbery legs, 
and his hand went up to the con- 
striction binding his skull. What 
was this? Goggles! Brink’s fingers 
curled about the flexible band se- 
curing them. He tugged. 

“Stop that, Brink!” 

Brink’s hand fell away. He rec- 
ognized the voice of Len Daniels, 
the recruiter for this illegal voyage 
here to Sulle II. 

“Want to lose your eyesight. 
Brink?” demanded the dapper little 
man. “We warned you of the dan- 
ger, For at least ten days your eyes 
must remain protected.” 

The little gray-haired man wore 
no glasses, he had acquired an im- 
munity to the sunlight of Sulle II 
from former voyages, but his natu- 
rally pink-and-white complexion 
was a sickly yellow. 

Their voices roused the other col- 
onists, and now Daniels moved 
among them, his soft full voice ad- 
monishing and sympathetic. 

A coarse-haired giant of a man, 
dark hair graying at the temples of 
his ruddy outsize features, clamped 
Brink’s fist with a huge hand. 

“Name’s Bryt Carby,” he said, 
his voice ridiculously shrill. 

“I’m Dorav Brink.” His eyes slid 
toward the tall slenderness of Rea 
Smyt. 



“Air don’t taste much different 
from back home. Brink.” 

Brink made a wry face. “After 
breathing spacer air and being 
doped with iberno for months could 
we tell the difference?” 

Carby laughed in agreement. 
“But Senior Daniels,” and Brink 
wanted to grin at the respectful 
term used by the big, slow speaking 
man, “Senior Daniels says that Sulle 
II is like Earth in almost every re- 
spect.” 

“He would! And possibly it is. 
According to him even the animals 
resemble our own planet’s.” 

“Once,” and Carby grinned 
widely, “I ate a bit of cooked native 
meat. Ten credits it cost me. After 
that the protein packets and yea- 
steaks sickened me.” 

“I tried it once too, Carby, but 
it cost me fifteen credits. And that’s 
the way Daniels and his company 
will get back the thousand credits 
we owe them for the trip.” Brink 
laughed. “With food that we raise 
and meat that we kill, Carby. Dan- 
iels flies it to Earth and smuggles 
it into the domes as native to Earth. 
His profit must be enormous.” 
Carby frowned and rubbed a 
stubby finger across the bridge of 
his huge nose. And Brink edged 
away from his neighbor toward the 
slim tallness of Rea Smyt. 

“Attention all of you!” Len Dan- 
iels had climbed atop a sturdy metal 
table. 

“On the bulletin board just be- 
hind me the Commission has posted 
a list of your assignments and part- 
ners for the current year. Some of 
you will remain here in Low Park 



105 




to work off your indebtedness, and 
others will be sent out to Middle 
Park and Devil’s Elbow.” 

Something in the agent’s tone, a 
touch of ironic amusement or ar- 
rogance, perhaps, angered Brink. 
But he kept his lips shut. In the 
ancient records that he had studied 
in the long idle years back there in 
York Dome, he had read of serfdom 
and slavery. He could afford to wait 
and learn if what he feared was 
true. After all, they were many 
light years from home and at Dan- 
iels’ mercy — ^for the moment at 
least. 

“After you have paired up and 
found the locations assigned you go 
to Warehouse Seven and draw your 
rations and tools. Your plastic tents 
will serve for shelter even in winter, 
but my advice to you is to build 
with logs.” 

The little man smiled a trifle 
grimly as he studied them. 

“I would advise you to himt game 
and raise crops as quickly as possi- 
ble,” he added. “Supplies and tools 
are expensive to freight out here to 
Sulle II. They will cost you five 
himdred more credits.” 

The colonists’ faces paled and 
their eyes were sick. Brink smiled 
grimly as he watched. Well they’d 
asked for it. Most of them were re- 
gretting their decision to abandon 
the ease and i ’enty of the giant 
domes already, but they had no 
choice now. Uncertainly they 
crowded about the bulletin board, 
and paired up as the directive in- 
dicated. 

Brink found himself with a part- 
ner named Tzal Evans. She proved 
to be a genial, oversized, blonde 

106 



giantess at least five years his senior. 
He had been hoping for a younger, 
more attractive companion — possi- 
bly dark-haired Rea Smyt. Yet he 
realized that the Commission could 
not permit its colonists to choose 
their jobs and partners at random. 
There was work to be done. 

He found the map and learned 
that both he and Bryt Carby were 
assigned to the untamed, forested 
section named Middle Park. And 
Bryt Carby had drawn Rea Smyt 
as his partner. 

Brink scrubbed at his chin. He 
foresaw difficulties ahead for Carby. 
The few moments that he had spent 
with Rea had acquainted him with 
her lightning changes of mood and 
her disdain for n^les and regula- 
tions. Those two had nothing in 
common. After the legal year of 
partnership was ended neither of 
them would be likely to renew the 
agreement for another year. 

Perhaps he. Brink, would draw 
her in next year’s pool of unat- 
tached citizens, and then . 

Tzal nudged at him. “Let’s get 
our supplies,” she said, her voice 
deep as a man’s. 

“Sure, Tzal.” The top of her 
fair-haired skull was level with his 
eyes, and across it he caught a 
glimpse of Rea Smyt leading Carby 
from the reception center. “Sure. 
We better.” 

Rea danced along ahead of Car- 
by like a child — a lovely slender 
child. 



D usk caught them, hours 

later, on the wooded ridge high 
above the broad valley that was 

BASIL WELLS 




their destination. 

Garby followed Rea off the 
crumbled highway, that the van- 
ished Sullans had built, and into a 
sheltered grove of long-leaved trees. 
Brink and Tzal, pushing easily to- 
gether at the harnesses behind the 
rubber-tired cart, followed them. 

Clumsily, for they had never 
seen a tent before, they released the 
forward section of the cart and 
drew out the slender jointed ribs of 
metal. They snapped these together 
into a low dome ten feet in dia- 
meter; and then Tzal controlled the 
extensible arms feeding out the 
plastic covering, while Brink locked 
the opaque skin into place. 

Five minutes later, with the wind 
cone driving the generator and the 
bottled gas feeding the small stove, 
Tzal was preparing their evening 
meal under the soft glowing tubes. 

She turned to Brink. 

“Better go help Garby,” she sug- 
gested, smiling. “That Rea — ” And 
she shook her head. 

Brink found Garby struggling 
doggedly with the metal ribs. His 
partner was not in sight, but they 
could hear her voice, singing softly 
somewhere out among the dusky 
trees. When at last the lighting 
tubes were glowing and Garby had 
lighted the stove. Brink eyed the 
weary, large-featured man curi- 
ously. 

“What are you going to do about 
it?” he blurted. “You can’t go on 
doing all the work. She needs a 
good — a good, lumping, I think the 
Ancients called it.” 

Garby grinned faintly. 

“When she is ready,” he said 
mildly, “she will help,” 

THE PIONEERS 



“Hah!” Brink snorted and went 
to the zippered entrance. “See you 
tomorrow, Bryt.” 

He crossed the near-darkness of 
the needle-strewn glade to his own 
tent. How bright were these stars 
and how sweet and cold was this 
raw air. In York Dome, with its 
thirty million citizens and its mild, 
conditioned atmosphere, one saw 
the stars only through telescreens or 
viewing ports. 

Somewhere in the darkness a 
mournful wail, an aching ghost of 
a howl, sounded, and faded into 
the unfamiliar chirps, and hums of 
the night prowlers of the Sullan up- 
lands . 

There was a choked scream from 
nearby and Brink heard the crash- 
ing progress of Rea Smyt toward 
her tent. The zippered entrance 
brightened and then dimmed as she 
shut it behind her. Brink shrugged. 
Stooping he entered his own savory- 
smelling tent. 

Tzal had covered the sleeping 
cots with the gay scarlet-and-blue 
blankets provided them, and their 
sliced and steaming rations were 
ready on the extended table shelf 
of the cart. Tzal smiled at him from 
the cot that doubled as a chair. 

“Better eat before it gets cold,” 
she invited, and helped herself to a 
serving of salmon-hued promine. 

“Tomorrow,” Brink said as he 
seated himself beside her, “we will 
dine on real meat — ^meat that I 
kill.” 

“Of course,” Tzal agreed placid- 
ly- 

Brink was remembering that 
easy promise, a month later, as he 

107 




bound the last raggedly split shake 
atop the cabin roof. The cabin was 
but ten feet wide and twice as long, 
and built of smallish logs, but its 
cost in blistered flesh and exhaus- 
tion had been terrific . 

Six days had passed after their 
arrival here in Middle Park before 
his unfamiliar, lead-propelling rifle 
finally had brought down a small 
deerlike creature . the hunting 
wasn’t easy — ^nothing here on Sulle 
II was easy. 

He slid off the roof and down the 
tnmk af a small tree that he had 
left here atop this grassy knoll. He 
straightened his hunched shoulders 
and heard the muscles grate and 
snap across the cartilage. He looked 
down over the grassy parkland, 
where a meandering stream wa- 
tered the soil, and coimted, for the 
hundredth time, the five young 
spotted ruminants that Carby, Tzal, 
and he had captured from a herd 
of wild creatures. 

“Cows,” Carby, and Tzal, his 
partner, called these giant cattle- 
like creatures, and he followed suit. 
It was easier to apply the familiar 
names to creatures that resembled 
those of Earth than to use the 
names supplied them at the Recep- 
tion Center. 

“Dorav!” He heard the voice and 
then the pressure of two rounded 
soft arms were around him. 

“Rea!” he grunted, facing her. 
He pushed her arms aside, all too 
conscious of the shielded breast 
that brushed the back of his hand. 

“Why are you here?” he de- 
manded. “You have work at your 
cabin. The walls are only half fin- 
ished ” 

108 



The girl smiled at him. She was 
very attractive in a slim boyish sort 
of way. The palm of her sun-tanned 
hand, as she laid it upon his wrist, 
was not calloused as were Tzal’s 
and his own. 

“My partner and yours are cut- 
ting logs above us,” she said. “We 
can be alone for several hours . 

Brink pushed her soft palm from 
his arm. For the past three weeks 
physical exhaustion and unwonted 
exercise had driven any desire for 
her from his thoughts. She was Car- 
by’s partner for a year — and Carby 
was his friend. 

“Don’t get me wrong, Dorav!” 
Her eyes flashed. They were blue 
and very dark and clear. “I want to 
go back to the Earth — ^to York 
Dome, to Sippi Dome or one of the 
other two domes in North Amer- 
ica.” 

“I think we all do at times,” 
Brink said coldly. “But it’s not pos- 
sible. Earth is forty or fifty light 
years away.” 

“I know a way.” Rea Smyt’s eyes 
were bright. “But I need a partner. 
Bryt won’t go — ^he likes it here. And 
your blonde cow of a partner . .” 

“Tzal is okay,” Brink said angrily. 
“Shut your mouth and go back to 
your own cabin before I — ” 

“We could go across the plains 
to the old ruins,” Rea cried hastily, 
“and then journey down . .” 

Brink’s work-roughened fingers 
spun her about facing toward Car- 
by’s cabin and the round gray tent 
beside it at the opposite end of the 
knoll. 

Rea was sobbing angrily. 

“I’ll go by myself,” she cried. 
“You fools can stay here and live 

BASIL WELLS 




like beasts — it’s so simple if you 
only . 

Brink gave her a shove. 

“If you worked as you should, 
you wouldn’t find time to be dis- 
contented. And next year you can 
draw a new partner from the unat- 
tached pool.” 

The girl’s eyes were hot as she 
turned and raced off along the path 
bisecting the knoll’s green-swarded 
crown. 

And Dorav Brink set to work 
building the huge stone-and-clay 
chunney that was to warm them in 
the winter ahead. The memory of 
Rea’s words and the softness of her, 
kept intruding. Suddenly, he found 
himself longing for the comforts 
and the security of York Dome — he 
had been a peace guard, serving 
two hours every month — life had 
been soft and easy . 

Savagely Brink swung his stone 
hammer, trying to smash his mem- 
ories of mechanized, pleasant sloth 
as well as the harsh substance of the 
rocks. 



I T WAS another morning, the 
weeks of feverish planting and 
hunting for game to trade at the 
frozen locker plant at Center, were 
behind them. Now it was late sum- 
mer on Sulle II, and even the early 
morning was uncomfortably warm. 

Brink yawned and stretched lux- 
uriously on his cot. Across the room 
Tzal still slept, her tousled, short- 
cropped hair faded by the sun, and 
her exposed firm flesh a ripe, gold- 
en-red. Her face was turned toward 
him and she was smiling faintly, as 
though at some pleasant dream 

THE PIONEERS 



fantasy. 

Brink felt a pleasant lethargy. 
Tzal was a good partner, she never 
criticized without reason, and he 
trusted her judgment. His eyes 
ranged over the cabin. It was stout 
and well- joined — and their hands 
had erected it. Their credits at the 
locker plant were growing, despite 
the disappearance of most of the 
wild herds of “cattle”. In another 
eight or ten years they would have 
repaid the passage advances and 
own a valuable property. 

It was odd, he thought idly, that 
he never considered any woman 
other than Tzal as his partner when 
he thought of the future. Actually, 
of course she would request a 
change of partners, as he also in- 
tended to do, at the year’s end. If 
the Commission allowed it she 
might even specify Bryt Carby — 
they worked well together in the 
fields and forest, and the three of 
them were good friends. 

Suddenly he was aware of Car- 
by’s voice shouting somewhere out- 
side. Brink pulled on his knee- 
length shorts and a sleeveless tunic, 
and struggled into his high, clumsi- 
ly cobbled boots of “cowhide”. He 
took down his repeating weapon 
and pocketed a handful of car- 
tridges. 

“What’s it?” asked Tzal sleepily. 

“I expect something is after the 
herd again,” Brink told her as he 
went out the heavy, double-planked 
door. 

He could hear Carby clearly now. 
He was calling for Rea. Brink swore 
under his breath and turned to re- 
enter the cabin, but Carby had seen 
him and hailed him. 



109 




“Rea left in the night,” the big 
man said. “She took one of the 
horses and a rifle. And she left a 
note. Says she is going back to live 
in one of the domes.” 

Brink whistled. The “horse” she 
had taken, actually a ystan accord- 
ing to the Commission, was only 
half-broken and a giant animal 
three times as large as its Earthly 
counterpart. 

“The loneliness must have driven 
her insane,” the big man cried. 
“We’ve got to follow her — get her 
to come back.” 

Garby’s eyes were wild. He 
clamped Brink’s right shoulder. 

“Are you coming or not, Dorav? 
She needs us. We’ve got to find 
her.” 

The big man’s eyes leaked tears. 
Brink realized, astounded, that the 
selfish, shallow, lazy woman — the 
woman, Rea Smyt — ^had won Car- 
by’s love. 

“Of course, Bryt. I’ll help you 
search.” 

“I will go too.” Tzal’s eyes were 
steady. “We must work together. 
When our child is bom another 
woman will be needed.” 

Brink opened his mouth to object 
— closed it. 

“Of course, but whether Rea is 
the one to . .” 

“She is a woman.” Tzal smiled 
faintly and nodded. 

“I’ll follow her tracks, the ystan^s 
tracks, westward across the park,” 
Bryt Garby said impatiently. “She 
must head south or north to climb 
out of the valley. You, Tzal, go to 
the north end of the valley and pick 
up the trail — if it’s there.” 

He shook the graying coarse hair 

no 



out of his reddened eyes. 

“You go south, Dorav. I’ll meet 
up with you in a few hours if the 
trail leads in that direction. If 
neither of you find a trail and a day 
passes, I suggest that you return to 
the cabins.” 

“Best plan,” Brink agreed. He 
called in to Tzal: “I’ll saddle up.” 

“Right with you,” his partner re- 
plied. 

But, with the approach of night. 
Brink’s big black ystan and his sad- 
dle-weary rider followed alone on 
the trail. Rea’s partner had not 
overtaken Brink as he had prom- 
ised. 

The trail was clearcut and easy 
to follow — Rea was letting her 
mount race at top speed southward 
along the dirt cmsted ancient high- 
way. And Brink’s half-tamed black 
stallion was endowed with stamina 
and speed that Garby’s dun mare 
could never match . Now, dark- 
ness had blanked out the spoor. 

At a miniature park’s brush- 
screened entrance. Brink urged the 
weary ystan into the natural hedge 
of leafy growth. The big black 
snorted half-hearted protest and 
reared as branches clawed and 
stung him. When they were through 
they were in a broad grassy mead- 
ow, and in the fading light of a full 
moon jagged mins stood etched 
against the darker trees. 

He did not attempt any explora- 
tion until he had eaten of fire- 
warmed, greasy meat and portions 
of bread sopped in the frying pan. 
Then he took a flaming branch, as 
thick through as his lower leg, and 
carried this rude torch into the 



BASIL WELLS 




ruins. 

What had once been a street lay 
before him. Jumbled walls of brick 
and stone marked widely separated 
buildings. 

In afi, he counted no less than 
forty-five mounds, when he came 
across an isolated squared block of 
stone tilted at an awkward angle 
and half buried. And cut into the 
stone was a blurred inscription. 

The lettering was alien, yet some- 
how, achingly familiar. Brink 
dropped to his knees to clean away 
the concealing sod; but the spell of 
concentration was broken by a rac- 
ing, swelling tattoo of hoofbeats. 
He sprang to his feet, remembering 
that he had left his rifle near the 
fire. 

The rider could be Bryt Carby — 
or it could be some, as yet undis- 
covered savage, native to the plan- 
et, or even Rea returning in panic. 

He found his rifle, stepped 
through the rim of bushes beside 
the ancient highway and waited in 
their shadow. The indistinct bulk 
of a ystan grew larger in the pale 
light of Sulle IFs lone satellite. At 
first Brink could see no rider; then 
he saw the huddled lump of dark- 
ness above the saddle. He stepped 
out into the road. 

“Rea?” he said. His rifle lifted 
above the horizontal, its butt at his 
hip. 

“Woa,” the rider moaned faintly, 
and the trembling ystan came to a 
drooping stand. 

Brink reached up to the rider to 
help her down. 

“No,” Rea whispered. “Hide me 
’ — hide — Ahorse. Savages . .” 

Brink grunted under his breath 

THE PIONEERS 



and tugged at the steaming ystan" s 
bit to lead the beast off the high- 
way. They pushed through the 
clawing branches, the ystan"s 
breathing stentorian and ragged. 
The exhausted mount was dying on 
its feet. 

They had scarcely reached the 
open meadow within, when the 
ystan collapsed. Rea fell with him, 
her right leg pinned under the 
twitching wet hulk. As Brink tugged 
her leg free, she groaned and went 
limp in his arms. Only then did he 
feel the stickiness of half-dried 
blood on her tunic and discover the 
sharp arrowhead that projected a 
full two inches from the front of her 
left shoulderblade. 

Gently he whittled at the arrow’s 
exposed shaft until the irregular 
metal head dropped off and then 
he jerked the arrow from the 
wound. He was glad that she was 
unconscious. 

The distant voices of humans, 
shouting unintelligible phrases, 
warned him of the approach of the 
savages. The fire! With his hands 
he smothered and buried the flames. 
It was possible that the aborigines 
might pass them by. He could not 
banish the smell of smoke as he had 
the telltale glow of the coals, but 
the direction of the wind might pro- 
tect them . 

The stiffening loom of the ystan 
lay between them and the park’s 
brushy entrance. Carefully he slid 
his rifle up and over the saddle. 

Voices and the sliding, chomp- 
tramp of hide-shod feet came and 
passed on. They had missed the 
break in the return tracks of Rea’s 
ystan. Or, perhaps, the hoofprints 

111 




of Brink’s mount seemed to them a 
continuation of her spoor. 

“I am awake,” a small voice 
whispered beside him. 

‘‘Are you in pain, Rea?” 

“Not much. Too near being dead 
for that. Fm done.” 

“No chance.” Brink’s voice was 
flat and false. She must have lost 
most of her blood. “How did it hap- 
pen?” 

“Was heading south on this high- 
way. Planned to turn east soon. To 
Denver or some other deserted city 
where I might find a tube shuttle to 
Sippi Dome. You realize — this is 
really Earth?’^ 

“Just now,” Brink agreed gruffly. 
“Found a cornerstone. Must have 
been a public building — a bank they 
called it. This was Gollrada Nation, 
or State.” 

“I knew . weeks ago. Tried to 
tell you. So . started alone.” 

She sat up suddenly, as though 
propelled by springs, and her good 
arm motioned toward the moonlit 
heights. She tried to say something, 
choked, and fell back. 

There was no pulse . 



T he third day after Rea’s 
death. Three days, and three 
of the hairy, half-naked white sav- 
ages, he thought grimly. He had 
never killed a fellow being before — 
in York Dome hatred and love and 
loyalty were mere words from the 
barbarian centuries — ^but now he 
had destroyed three of his own kind. 
Nor did he feel any shame or re- 
gret . 

The savages on Rea’s backtrail 
had come upon Bryt Carby. He had 

112 



killed one of them before they had 
overpowered him and built their 
fires. 

Carby had not died until an hour 
after Brink had come upon the 
howling pack of six warriors and 
had emptied his gun into them. He 
had killed two of them outright and 
wounded three others; and then he 
had cared for the broken, blistered 
thing that had been his friend, until 
Carby died. 

Now he watched before the cave 
where two savages lay hidden — and 
he watched the growing swarmings 
of green-bodied flies about the ele- 
vated rocky lip of their shelter. 

The warriors must not escape to 
carry word back to their tribesmen 
of the settlement of the men from 
York Dome . 

At a sound from behind him, he 
turned about, his rifle butt dug into 
his shoulder and chest, his finger 
pressing the firing button. 

“Tzd!” 

Behind the boulder overlooking 
the savages’ rocky death trap he 
took her in his arms. She was Tzal, 
smiling and full-bodied as always, 
and his partner for this year and for 
the other years. The years yet to 
come. 

She was dirt-streaked and sweaty. 
Her clothes were tom and her hair 
was matted and discolored with 
dust. Weariness darkened the skin 
beneath her eyes . She was beau- 
tiful! 

“Where,” she asked him after a 
time, “are they hidden?” 

“Up there, just back of those — ” 

He spun about, racing back to 
where he had dropped his rifle. The 
two savages, wounded and limping 

BASIL WELLS 




grotesquely, were scuttling toward a 
broken jumble of rock fragments. 
Once hidden there they might work 
up the slope and escape. 

Tzal's rifle cracked, once, twice, 
even as he turned and brought up 
his own weapon. A defiant yell 
slapped across the rocky slot and 
an arrow thudded weakly at Tzal’s 
feet. Brink’s thumb hit the firing 
button and the warrior spun about 
and fell across the man Tzal had 
shot. 

For now the settlements were 
safe. The colonists, bargaining years 
of hard work for a supposed pas- 
sage to a distant unsettled world, 
were secure from attack. Only a 
few hours from their luxurious 
home domes, they could sweat and 
toil and suffer as the hardy ex- 
plorers of the earlier centuries must 
have done. 

Dorav Brink wanted to laugh — 
to tell Tzal and the others of the 
colossal duping they had experi- 
enced. Yet he kept silent. From the 
evil of the trickery a great good 
might come. For the first time in 
centuries men were living an active. 



brain-stimulating life. 

Let the great hothouse domes 
with their dwarfish inbred animals 
in their parks, and their controlled 
atmosphere, and odor content in- 
dex, and mass-produced pleasure 
booths go their way. Let the pale, 
thready-muscled humans nibble 
their synthetic promines and yea- 
steaks — the pioneers had no need 
for substitutes . 

Brink’s arm went around Tzal’s 
shoulders and he was looking into 
her shaken, tear-stained eyes. He 
smiled. It was the first time he had 
ever seen his placid partner so 
moved. 

“All this,” Brink said, his hand 
sweeping, “for our son, and for the 
sons to follow him. Our children 
will make of Sulle II a better world 
than Earth.” 

Tzal’s lips trembled. She had not 
heard him, he thought. His head 
lifted yet higher and he filled his 
lungs with the crisp upland air. 
Tzal was clinging to him, depend- 
ing on him . 

Precisely, perhaps, as Tzal wished 
him to feel. • • •

THE PIONEERS 




In the not too distant future, you 
will walk into a supermarket, shop, 
pay the bill, and walk out with a 
cash receipt that identifies your 
bags of groceries — but you won’t 
carry the groceries to your car. An 
endless belt will speed them straight 
to the parking lot. And when you 
put the bags on the kitchen table, 
they won’t topple over, because they 
will be shorter, squatter and wider 
at the bottom. New equipment fore- 
shadows other aids to shopping, 
such as carts with wrap around 
handles so that you can push them 
or pull them from either side or end, 
automatic doors that open as you 
approach them, food cabinets that 
can be reached from all sides, and 
large tanks of synthetic sea water 
that keep lobsters “sea-fresh”. 

Houses of the future may all be 

built using a four-inch cube, called 
a module, as a structural “atom.” 
Nowadays the architect draws his 
plans according to feet, inches and 
fractions of inches. When construc- 
tion begins, plumbers, masons and 
carpenters have to cut and patch 
their non-standardized materials to 
make them fit the requirements. 
The new system of modular meas- 
ure would eliminate this waste by 



making use of building materials 
that are standardized to the four- 
inch cube. Thus, when the workers 
follow a blueprint scaled to the 
module, all parts would automat- 
ically fit. It is estimated, from the 
structures already built with this 
method, that industry would save 
billions of dollars a year by fully 
adopting this method. 

If present trends continue, surgical 
mortality of the future may well 
nigh be non-existent. Figures show 
that in the past ten years deaths 
from major surgical operations have 
been cut by as much as four-fifths, 
in some instances, and at least by 
half in the overall picture. Improve- 
ments in training, surgical tech- 
niques, anaesthetic substances and 
procedures, post operative and pre- 
operative procedures, increasing use 
of antibiotics, and the use of blood 
transfusions to prevent death from 
shock have all been major factors. 
The record is all the more remark- 
able, because in recent years more 
than half the patients operated on 
have been aged fifty or over. 

Underwater explorers may soon be 
able to pedal themselves into the 
watery depths. A new device, de- 
signed to go along with snorkles and 
swimfins, is a sort of miniature sub- 
marine about to 12 feet long. 
The operator sits inside a plastic 
bubble and powers the sub by 
pumping pedals. The pedals drive 
the propeller and the sub heads 
downward and then straight ahead. 
On a calm day the device can move 
along under water at a speed of 4 
or 5 miles per hour. Designed pri- 

14 




manly for offshore prospectors for 
oil and uranium, it is also ideal for 
treasure hunters and sportsmen. 

Home baked bread like grandma 
used to make may soon be an actu- 
ality, but the hard work will be 
eliminated. The Canadian Defense 
Research Board has come up with 
an instant bread mix which pro- 
duces the same tasty aromatic loaf 
without kneading or fermentation. 
All the baker has to do is add water 
and then bake for two hours. It will 
be available in U.S. stores, but so 
far no one knows exactly when. 

Car designers of the future may re- 
duce the death toll from head-on 
collisions by putting trunk space be- 
hind the engine. Recent experi- 
ments by the Highway Research 
Board showed that less then one- 
third of the initial jolt of a collision 
is absorbed by the car frame. Put- 
ting more car structure between the 
front bumper and the driver would 
increase the absorption of the im- 
pact. 

Farmers may some day be able to 
produce six or seven ears on one 
stalk. Recent investigations by plant 
physiologists have discovered an un- 



known factor in com strains that 
causes them to regularly produce 
either one or two ears to a stalk. 
They have also foimd that by 
blocking off the point at which one 
ear is begining to develope, the 
stalk is forced to produce an ear at 
another point. Some minor success 
has produced as many as three min- 
iature ears, using this blocking tech- 
nique, and then allowing the 
blocked ear to develope after the 
third ear has formed at the new 
point. 

Hospitals of the future may have 
stocks of dura, the membrane that 
covers the brain. A recently dis- 
covered technique has enabled 
medical research men to preserve 
this membrane by the freeze-drying 
method, which is also used for pre- 
serving arteries and other tissues. 
Success with dogs has been reported 
by members of the Naval Medical 
Research Institute, and frozen dura 
has been stockpiled at the tissue 
bank of the Naval Medical School 
and will be used clinically at the 
Naval Hospital at Bethesda, Mary- 
land.

fiery death has passed its first tests 
and may soon be a “must” on all 
aircraft. The tank, which is made 
of tough rubberized nylon, is rup- 
ture proof and will not spew forth 
its contents at high speeds. Tests 
show that the tank can withstand 
direct impacts of up to 75 miles an 
hour. The cell bodies range in 
weight from one-tenth to six-tenths 
of a pound per square foot and are 
designed to remain intact in a 
crashing plane until enough force is 
built up to rip the wing off. 

Sometime in the future the Earth 
may be dotted with large-scale fac- 
tories that are making food by arti- 
ficial photosynthesis. Recent dis- 
coveries in the field have opened 
new vistas of unlimited food and 
power supplies; a time when Man 
would no longer have to depend on 
green plants for food and energy 
sources, but will be able to tap sun- 
light directly. Researchers have 
found that the true “solar engine” 
of plants is in the small, chlorophyll- 
containing green granules called 
chloroplasts. When isolated, these 
chloroplasts use sunlight to split 
water into hydrogen and oxygen ex- 
actly as is done in the living plants. 
The scientists have also found 
chemicals which will stop each step 
in the complete cycle of photosyn- 
thesis which follows so that men in 
the laboratories can separate or 
combine the processes at will and 
see what happens. The goal for the 
future is a harnessing of the sun’s 
energy to make foods out of carbon 
dioxide and water in larger amounts 
than that which growing plants are 
able to provide. Ultimately, through 



such a mechanism, energy-rich 
chemicals may be built up from 
sunlight to provide unlimited power 
for industry as well. 

Don't be too surprised if you soon 
see bathing suits made of the new 
stretch yarns. Manufacturers think 
they have the technical problems 
licked now, and if they do, that old 
joke about the lady who carries her 
bathing suit in her purse will be 
more fact than fiction. 

Personnel directors of the future 
may hire their scientists and labora- 
tory workers by testing their mental 
“temperature”. A new concept has 
shown that the different rates of 
scientific production are much 
larger than other variations among 
men. No runner can race 100 times

faster than another, and one man 
doesn’t speak 100 times faster than 
another. But mental “temperature” 
or capacity, likens the production of 
ideas to a chemical reaction. A 
small increase in temperature can 
speed the reaction considerably. If 
one man’s mental temperature is 
twice that of another, he is likely to 
be 100 times more productive. 

Gardeners may now envision a 
weed-free future with more and 
more certainty. Several products, in 
testing stages, have shown signs of 



being exactly what the suburban 
home-owner has been dreaming 
about. A new weed-killer, mixed 
with the soil before planting, has 
proven quite successful in attacking 
only the weeds, allowing the flower- 
bed to grow luxuriously without a 
single weed. 

Another successful item is a new 
non-poisonous, non-corrosive weed 
killer that permanently sterilizes soil 
beneath pavements etc. and is ideal 
under walks, driveways, fences, 
parking areas and even the side- 
walks in front of your house.

Dear jlq: 

Naturally I turned to the editorial im- 
mediately after arriving home with your 
mag. I must compliment you on a good 
job. You did some pretty fast thinking 
in order to beat your deadline for turn- 
ing in a 2 page filler. 

Needless to say, I am inclined to 
favor a practical application of eugenics, 
the science whose aim is to breed a 
superior human stock ; not by combining 
those qualities considered favorable by 
one generation in one locality, but rather 
by weeding out those characteristics 
which almost all people consider un- 
favorable. 

Certainly idiots (I.Q. 20 — ) are capa- 
ble of producing geniuses. It would be 
useless to argue with you on that point. 
One thing to be remembered, though, 
is that the percentage of high I.Q.’s 
from such matings is substantially lower 
than that from 2 normal persons. An 
example of, and probably the most wide- 
ly publicized of inherited physical aflflic- 
tions is Hemophilia, which is carried by 
a recessive gene. This is the disease that 
indirectly led to the Russian Revolution 
1918. It certainly would eliminate much 
suffering if matings between persons 



carr)dng this and similar genes could be 
prohibited. 

You cited the example of Europe’s 
former ruling houses. Here we certainly 
have an example of controlled breeding 
— but was it carried on scientifically} 
Hardly. Here harmful recessives were al- 
lowed to multiply until they began show- 
ing up regularly. I wonder what the 
results would be if beneficial genes were 
allowed to multiply in similar f^hion. 

How do you reason that individual 
enterprise must be bred out of the race? 
How much “individual enterprise” does 
a Mongolian Idiot demonstrate? This is, 
of course, an extreme example — ^but I 
doubt that you can prove that deficient 
intelligence breeds “individual enter- 
prise”. 

Certainly the U.S. has prospered. If 
there is any such thing as a gene for 
“individual enterprise” I’m willing to 
wager that most of the people immigrat- 
ing to these shores would have to have 
had it in order to even conceive of 
leaving the “old country”. “It was built 
. and men with some of the worst 
brains in the world.” The preceding is a 
direct quotation from your editorial 
What does “worst” mean? Name a few 
such men. 

In preceding centuries there existed 
conditions in most parts of the globe 
which insured survival to the fittest. As a 
result, harmful recessives were prevented 
from spreading to a great extent. Now 
that the superior individuals thus 
created have made it possible for every 
microcephlic to live as long as other 
men’s ingenuity can keep them alive, I 
wonder how we will prevent the average 
I-Q- (by this I refer to potential brain 
power) from dropping below the ac- 
cepted mean of 100. 

You could’ve done well to make a 
more extensive survey of eugenics as 
even a rank amateur such as myself can 
spot the shallowness of your reasoning. 

— Edmund Luksus, 3717 Johnson 
Street, Gary, Indiana. 

Maybe I didn^t succeed in making my 
point in that editorial (January issue). 
However, it was simply this: Individual 
incentive is a more promising avenue to 
good government and a healthy nation 
than selective breeding, — jlq 




Dear Mr. Quinn; 

Just felt impelled to write a “letter 
to the editor’* to say I thii^ the Febru- 
ary issue is about as consistently meri- 
torious as I’ve seen, including the cover. 
Not a really weak story in it, although I 
thought the motivation in “Seller of the 
Sky” was a little faulty. For some reason, 
“The Odd Ones” particularly tickled 
my fancy, even though I assumed all 
along that Dickson’s human characters 
were male and female. 

I especially liked your editorial, not 
only for giving me a bit more insight 
into your preferences for stories but for 
the general discussion of science fiction. 
I agree thoroughly that it should be 
primarily entertainment. Whatever les- 
sons of psychology and philosophy may 
or may not be concealed therein, the 
magic of literature that is pure enter- 
tainment never palls. I still remember 
the charm of Edgar Rice Burroughs 
when I was a boy; and Jack William- 
son’s “The Green Girl,” the first science 
fiction serial I ever read. 

— Charles L. Fontenay, 424 

Chadwell Drive, Madison 
Tenn. 

After the preceding letter and the one 
to follow, J am happy to say ^Uhanks^* 
to the author of Escape Velocity and 
Blow the Man Down. — jlq 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

To say the least, your editorial (IF, 
March-55) aroused my interest more 
ways than one. First, it is uncommon to 
find such material in the usual stf pub- 
lications. But you seem to feel that since 
stf bases much of its premises and con- 
cepts on sociological factors, a stf mag 
should be the most likely place for 
sociological dissertations. That’s all good 
and well. More power to men in the 
publishing field who don’t remain stereo- 
typed and primitive in locomoting them- 
selves editorially. 

However, none of the above obviates 
the fallacious thinking employed in the 
message you wished to impart. Since 
you seem to express yourself along lines 
of wanting more democracy in what 
obviously is an age bereft of much of it, 
then allow me to continue. And if you 
can see your way to doing it, reproduce 



this letter in one of your future issues 
so that some of your readers derive 
democratic satisfaction from “hearing** 
both sides. 

To begin with, you state that with 
an all-powerful union in America (like 
the AFL-GIO merger now being con- 
templated) “A dictatorship” could very 
well be “the next easy step.” But this has 
always been the feeling of countless 
numbers of people since the first vestiges 
of unionizing were found in this country 
close to one hundred or more years ago. 
What you base your ukase upon is hard- 
ly anything new, nor is it just and logi- 
cal. Unions have always been cited as 
t^annical, too overbearing, and rather 
high handed in their dealings with the 
“poor, suffering, misunderstood ‘boss’ 
and industrialist,” who, of course, has 
nothing but the welfare of his employees 
at heart and who “knows” better than 
they do what is good and right. 

Next, part of your argument is based 
upon the fact that even small union or- 
ganizations — despite their smallness — 
have been able to paralyze vast shipping 
areas around the country, or have immo- 
bilized the steel industry (which in turn 
suspended industrially all automotive, 
construction, and various concerns de- 
pendent upon steel). But to that I say; 
well, so what? No, don’t misunderstand 
my tone as being blas6, apathetic or 
filled with pique. Bear with me a mo- 
ment. By “so what?” I and no doubt 
millions of others mean: 

So what if various people can’t get 
their pleasure cars on time and have to 
wait perhaps a few months more? And, 
what of it if many can’t get milk a few 
days, a few weeks, or even a month (I 
can’t remember a milk strike which 
lasted too long) ? What of it when mil- 
lions belonging to the laboring classes 
have had to do with less than half the 
milk required, in order that a family be 
healthfully sustained, not for years but 
one to two decades or more? For that 
matter, what of the many millions who 
still can’t afford a car, even though car- 
buying terms have never been more 
liberal than 1954-55? Well, someone 
could say, they can always ride on the 
trains or buses, . 

The trouble with the kind of thinking 



119 




portrayed in your editorial steins from a 
number of factors, not just one. It is a 
matter of conditioned belief, not sound 
analysis. You mention unions and 
Caesar, Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini in 
the same breath, although scientifically 
and sociologically these four personal- 
ities are inimical to unions. Unions 
aren’t represented by only one man or 
even two men as the philosophies and 
governments of Stalin or Hitler were. 
One might easily liken unions as a semi- 
state within a state. They are composed 
of millions who are members. These 
members all have an equal voice in their 
affairs. When something is amiss or must 
be ^ righted, they have the power to 
legislate and straighten them out, knock- 
ing out any of their leaders from power 
if necessary. And as lawful citizens of 
the country, just like the President, 
members of the House, yourself, your 
family, and all others, they too have the 
right to collectively run their affairs the 
way they wish. 

But basically your entire argument is 
mostly founded on an illusion of “what 
might happen”. That is to say, you try 
to predict something short of chaos aris- 
ing out of a national union stronger than 
it’s ever been before. Yet you overlook 
the fact that as a result of increasingly 
stronger unions this nation has been able 
to fight off depressions that have been 
more than once imminent for the last 
ten years. That doesn’t mean that we 
may not have depressions because unions 
exist, or that one united and powerful 
union would stave it off. However, it 
definitely indicates that such a vital so- 
cial force is all too often importantly 
responsible for warding off national or 
world-wide economic cataclysms. 

To say the least, the political and 
democratic welfare of the nation hardly 
has everything to do with union leaders. 
Merely the results of the last Presi- 
dential elections and recent national 
elections of Nov., ’54, proves this to be 
so, contrary to Union exhortations to 
elect the entire Democratic ticket. The 
balance of votes and in the way they 
were divided cross-country showed the 
most healthy trend, politically or ideolo- 
gically, this nation has taken to date. 
Doesn’t this indicate that the union con- 



tingents are human beings with their 
own free-will and minds to think? That 
they aren’t the “1984” automatons with 
a Big Brother over them which you try 
to describe. 

It seems peculiarly odd to me that a 
person who has such a keen taste for 
selecting the higher caliber material 
you’ve brought into IF to date can ex- 
press himself so archaically, practically 
maliciously, and so much like the robber 
barons who tried running the country 
back some decades ago. Probably you’ve 
got an axe to grind being a publisher 
and since publishing costs have soared 
up about 325% (maybe more) since 
1949. That’s a shame— -but it seems to 
me that a few more besides a publisher, 
his family, and the handful of people 
who make up his staff have the right to 
eat and live better. As for the publisher: 
don’t worry, you’ve made a nice little 
pile when you could; and if you haven’t 
done so in the last few months or re- 
cently, blame yourself. 

A class of workers that has long been 
underrated, overworked, and grossly un- 
derpaid is the white-collar group. This 
includes secretaries, clerks, filers, writers, 
commercial artists, and those who work 
on editorial staffs, etc. Perhaps it may 
not make you happy, but the time is 
growing ever nearer when this working 
class has at long last a strong union to 
back it up. There is no room for cheap 
labor in a progressive society . 

Finally, the only thing this nation has 
to fear is the day when no one has either 
voice or “pull” with which to express 
himself and righteously wield the power 
inherent to all men. At this time I can- 
not think of a better voice for most peo- 
ple than unions. If a better voice some- 
day manifests itself, no doubt I’ll go 
along with it. Until then unions do 
much more than suffice.

The **hue and cry** on that March issue 
editorial is coming in like a load of 
bricks. However, my opinion is my 
opinion, but if I can continue to duck

How You Can Master 
GOOD ENGLISH 

... in 15 Minutes a day 




T housands of persons make 
mistakes in their everyday Eng- 
lish — and don’t know it. It is sur- 
prising how many persons fail in spell- 
ing such common words as “business,” 
“judgment.” “beneficiary,” and “re- 
ceive”; say “between you and I” in- 
stead of “between you and me”; use 
“who” for “whom” ; and mispronounce 
the simplest words. And it is equally 
astonishing how few know whether to 
use one or two “c’s” or “m’s” or “s’s” 
(as in “recommend” or “disappoint”), 
or when to use commas in order to 
make their meaning clear. Most per- 
sons use only common words — color- 
less, flat, ordinary. Their speech and 
their letters are lifeless, humdrum. 

What Does Your English Say 
About You? 

Does your English help or hinder 
you? Every time you talk, every 
time you write, you show what you 
are. When you use the wrong word, 
when you mispronounce a word, when 
you punctuate incorrectly, when you 
use commonplace words, you handi- 
cap yourself enormously. English, 
the very tool you should use to im- 
prove your business or social position, 
holds you back. And you don’t real- 
ize it. for people are too polite to tell 
you about your mistakes. 

But now Sherwin Cody offers you a 
common sense method of acquiring a 
mastery of English in only a few min- 
utes a day. It’s so easy to stop mak- 
ing the mistakes in English which 
have been hindering you and learn to 
present your ideas clearly and force- 
fully on all occasions — without even 
thinking about it

What Cody Did at Gary 

For years Mr. Cody studied the 
problem of creating instinctive habits 
of using good English. Several years ago 
he was invited to teach English to all 
upper-grade pupils in Gary, Indiana. 
Mr. Cody secured more improvement in 
these pupils in five weeks than previous- 
ly had been obtained by similar pupils 
in two years under the old methods. 

100% Self-Correcting Device 

The basic principle of Mr. Cody’s 
method is habit-forming. Suppose 
he himself were standing forever at 
your elbow. Every time you made 
a mistake, suppose you could hear 
him whisper: “That is wrong, it should 
be thus and so.” In a short time you 
would habitually use the correct form 
and the right words. 

Mr. Cody’s patented 100% Self- 
Correcting Device does exactly this. 
It is his silent voice behind you, ready 
to speak whenever you commit an 
error. It finds your mistakes and con- 
centrates on them. You are not drilled 
upon anything you already know; and 
there are no rules to memorize. 

The study of English has been 
made so simple that no more than 
fifteen minutes a day is required — and 
not of study, but of fascinating prac- 
tice! Those who take advantage of 
Mr. Cody’s method gain something 
so priceless that it cannot be meas- 
ured in terms of money. They gain a 
facility of speech that marks them as 
educated persons in whatever society 
they find themselves. They gain self- 
confidence and self-respect. As for 
material reward, the importance of 
good English in the race for success 
cannot be over-estimated. Surely 
no one can advance far without it.
