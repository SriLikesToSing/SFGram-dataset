STRATEGY & TACTICS is a magazine. It’s 
also a tool: a time machine that enables you 
to replay the crucial events - past, present, 
and future — that shape our lives. 

Now, Instead of merely reading about what's 
happening, you can explore and experience 
the alternatives and decision points through 
the technique of Conflict Simulation. 

What is Conflict Simulation? 

Conflict Simulation is a way of analyzing a 
political or military conflict situation. A way 
that IS as intellectually stimulating as a game 
of chess, and as thorough as a written analysis. 

Through the use of the Conflict Simulation 
(or "game") format, the conflict situation is 
re-created — so that you are in a position to 
make the vital decisions and. in the game at 
least, change the way things were. are. or 
will be. 

What you got 

STRATEGY* TACTICS magazine is publish- 
ed bi-monthly. Each issue contains: 

♦ A ready-to-play conflict-simulation game 
with a 22 X 28" playing surface, die-cut play- 



ing pieces, and complete rules. 

* An analytical article on the same subject as 
the game m that issue. 

* Other feature articles on historical and 
military subjects. 

* Game and book reviews, commentary on 
existing games, and discussions of subscribers' 
questions. 

The magazine is 48 + pages long, and all 
material is handled in a highly organized (and 
easily understandable) graphic format.

PART ONE 



ROBERT WELLS 



The last young Superom had 
a choice: to rule a dead 
world— or make it live! 



Book1,SHEVAN 

I 

^T^HEIR sun was burning out. 

Inside a decaying observatory 
two live shadows moved among dead 
shadows. They fused, separated 
again. Two pale faces turned up to 
the dying sun. It was framed in a grin 
of sky formed by a split in the roof. 
Whispers inside the cracked observa- 
tory dome sounded like a part of the 
darkness. Centuries of weather had 
worn away the curt, anagramatic 
signs around the dome’s inner rim. 

7 



The darkness fell in through the 
holes. 

“It’s true, Del. It really is true. It’s 
beginning to consume itself. Faster 
and faster.” The girl turned her head 
toward the young man beside her. 
Her eyes were huge, feeding on fear. 
“We have to go on. We must get to 
Mandanar.” 

“I can’t understand it,” he said. 
“What does it say?” 

He didn’t look at her. He was 
staring at the broken messages 
around the dome. He was older and 
taller than she, a broad-shouldered 
giant, but his face under a cap of 
black hair was much less animated 
than hers-almost expressionless. He 
continued to stare at the dome and 
the sun in a bewildered way. 

‘This place scares me, Shewy. 
Let’s go hunt talues.” He stopped, 
his forehead wrinkling as his brain 
chased a notion of guilt. “We 
shouldn’t have gone off and left 
Keren and Karel at Spadrox. We 
shouldn’t have—” He kept looking at 
the sun. 

“Del, we had to escape. We must 
get to Mandanar.” The girl stamped 
her foot hard against the floor. Dust 
rose in the darkness. 

She was lightly built, her face as 
sharp as a bird’s. Blue skintight 
coveralls flattened the natural curves 
of her body so that with her short 
bobbed hair she could have been a 
boy. Only the soft push of her new 



breasts and the token skirt at the 
waist of the suit advertised her sex. 
Her name— Shevan— was embroidered 
on her collar. 

Delbet glanced away from the roof 
and down at her at last. 

“I only came because of you. To 
look after you. I don’t really want to 
go to Mandanar. You know that, 
Shev.” He sulked, then went on. “I 
don’t believe the sun’s going out. It’s 
always been there. Superom like us 
put it there. Let’s go back and tell 
Keren we made a mistake— we got 
lost. And maybe he won’t—” 

“No!” The foot stamped again. 
Shevan grabbed his arm and tried to 
shake him. 

“You and I are two of the only 
Superom-maybe the only two true 
Superom— left in this Vortex of the 
galaxy, Del. The sun they put up in 
the'sky of Thetis is failing. Manda- 
nar’s our only hope. Don’t you want 
to stay alive? Don’t you want to go 
after the others?” 

“Now, Shewy, you know it’s all 
just out of those talk-tapes you got 
to studying in that old, sm^ed-up 
library place—” 

He stopped, as if trying to recall 
something. The girl stood raging but 
silent in the gloom before him. Her 
eyes were huge, her fists clenched. 
Del grinned and shook his head, 
trying to make her respond with a 
smile. 

She turned and ran away from 



8 



IF 




him. He heard her jump through the 
gap in the observatory wall into the 
twilight. He went after her slowly. 

She was easy to find. The observa- 
tory stood on a hill. Delbet went 
down it toward her sobs, moving 
swiftly and easily for such a big man. 

He squatted beside her in the sand 
and scrub and patted her shaking 
back. She wrenched away from him. 

“How many times do I have to tell 
you —don’t do that!” 

She used not to get angry when he 
touched her. Now she sometimes did. 
It was a sign she was growing up. 

“Come on, Shev,” he coaxed. “I 
didn’t mean to make you wild. May- 
be you could be wrong— huh? Maybe 
those talk-tapes got it muddled. May- 
be the sun just looks like it’s getting 
smaller. It isn’t any colder, is it— days 
or nights? Summer still summers, 
doesn’t it? I haven’t noticed frost on 
Keren’s beard in the mornings.” He 
laughed but Shevan didn’t share his 
humor. 

“You’re so dumb.” She stood up 
suddenly and punched his chest hard 
with both her small fists. “You don’t 
act like Superom, Del. You don’t 
think like Superom.” 

Delbet looked bewildered. He put 
out a hand to wipe tears from her 
face, but stopped just in time. 

“What’s the use fretting, Shev? 
Come on— let’s go hunt talues before 
the sun goes down. Anyway— let’s get 
out of here. That old observatory 



gives me the creeps. Look— I made, a 
new slingbow. Let’s raise the talues 
and worry them instead of getting so 
damn miserable and bothering our- 
selves/’ 

He stood up also, holding out his 
hands. 

Shevan didn’t move. “Del-I’m go- 
ing on without you.” 

He crouched again, his handsome 
saint’s face knitting into a frown of 
frustration. 

“Oh, Shev-you’re so-so-” 

His frown became deeper as words 
failed him. 

“No,” she said, using a feminine 
path of attack. “I don’t need you 
because you damn well don’t believe 
me. And you’ve forgotten everything 
I told you. And if you were real 
Superom you’d rage like me at being 
a prisoner and working the cruze 
mine for Keren and just being con- 
tent to sit on Thetis and go out when 
the sun goes out.” 

TkEL’S throat made tiny anguished 
■*-^noises of denial and defense, 
but they didn’t come to words. He 
loved Shevan so well he wanted to 
take her up in one arm as he had 
when she had been a baby and quiet 
her tantrums. But her body was as 
taut and unyielding as a steel whip- 
spring on one of his machines back in 
the cruze mine— and her voice was a 
whip that punished him, too. He 
didn’t touch her again. 



INHERITANCE

When she paused, her head bent, 
he said, “But what’s there going to 
be at Mandanar, Shevvy? And just 
think of all the stone jungle and 
Conducs and those damned awful 
Helangles and the devil knows what 
else between us and there. Why-” 
She raised her head and her eyes 
blazed at him. Delbet, big as he was, 
shrank back. 

“You dummy! You’ve never lis- 
tened to anything I told you. I don’t 
want you with me. Get back to 
Keren and the mine. I don’t know 
why I trusted you and told you 
everything.” 

“Shev— wait— Shevvy, hold on. I 
forget those things easily. You know 
that. I’m always thinking about in- 
venting things. New bits for the 
machines or slingbows or-or-you 
know. Listen, I made the aircar sp we 
could escape together— now, didn’t I? 
Come on, Shev. You know that!” 

A pause. Then: “Listen, we’ll just 
sit down here quietly and you tell me 
again and I won’t say a damn word 
and I bet I’ll repeat everything you 
tell me exactly.” 

“No.” She shook her head, twist- 
ing away from him. “You don’t 
really care. You don’t mind going 
into the dark. You don’t want to be 
back with the Superom.” 

Del coaxed: “But I do want to be 
with you, Shev. You know that I do. 
Now, who could fix the aircar if it 
stalled, eh? Who could do that? And 



who could keep off the Conducs or 
the Helangles if they came after you? 
Come— you tell it again. I’ll listen 
carefully so I won’t get it wrong any 
more.” 

And having won as she had intend- 
ed to win, Shevan went back to the 
beginning and told it again for him. 
She didn’t believe he would care 
about it or even remember it, but she 
needed him with her, whatever she 
said. And this was the way to ensure 
that she didn’t have to turn back to 
Keren, who had almost ceased to be 
Superom anyway— and Karel who 
had been unconscious of all people 
and events for several hundred years 
while he lay pale and alone, neither 
dead nor living, in the green, frosted 
hibernation casket at Spadrox. So 
she told it. 

When the Superom moved from 
their origins in the Outer Vortices of 
the galaxy toward the center they 
looked for planetary systems most 
like their own. 

Del started to ask what the real, 
first Superom planetary system was 
like because it sounded as though it 
could be the kind of thing Shevan 
delighted to explain, but her eyes 
shut him up quickly. 

As their knowledge and skill devel- 
oped, Superom began trying to re- 
claim planets that might otherwise 
have proved uninhabitable. 

In the three thousandth age of 
their appearance in the Fourth Vor- 



10 



IF 




tex they developed the artificial sun. 
Thetis was one of the first worlds 
reclaimed by a Superom sun planted 
in its sky to supplement the pale 
globe that was dying there and had 
already spread to swallow some of its 
inner satellites. 

Thetis grew into a world of mag- 
nificent cities linked by superb high- 
ways and aircar routes. Superom 
peace, prosperity, trade, ruled here 
just as it did in the other Vortices 
they had settled. 

Del grinned and nodded, proud of 
his ancestors. Then he frowned hard 
because he remembered what came 
next and it always scared him. It was 
hard to understand. 

Then (said Shevan) six hundred 
eight years ago a plague began to 
sweep through the Inner Vortices. It 
attacked the thought processes of the 
Superom brain. It left the mind 
dumb and brutish. It seemed to 
confine its attack to the Superom 
alone. Lesser breeds of humanity 
escaped completely. So did any na- 
tive survivors in the Superom Com- 
monwealth. 

Del realized his heart was starting 
to pound uncomfortably. He twisted 
his head from t)ne side to another 
just to look anywhere but into SheV’s 
great round eyes staring back at the 
frightening past. 

The cause of the plague couldn’t 
be isolated. There was no identifiable 
virus, mo hostile germ, no reason why 



the attack should fall on the Super- 
om and on no other life form. The 
affliction spread rapidly. It wasn’t 
deterred by hyper space. It broke out 
in several places at once. In the end 
the Galactic Council agreed on a 
total retreat of Superom from the 
Third and Fourth Vortices. 

AS IF they were retreating from a 
real enemy instead of something 
intangible and unknown, the Super- 
om went into a hurried flight toward 
their origins, abandoning their civili- 
zations in panic. 

Del licked his lips-and gripped 
his new slingbow. His knuckles 
whitened. He wanted to fight this 
enemy from which his fathers had 
fled. But where was it? Why had the 
old ones' left Keren and Karel and 
him and Shewy on Thetis? He 
frowned, his eyes seeking responses. 
Shevan told him, her heart moved by 
his limited understanding, his sim- 
plicity. 

Just before the plague a Superom 
expeditionary ship had le^t Thetis for 
the Fifth Vortex. The Superom had 
been on the point of probing for a 
new extension of the Common- 
wealth. The expedition had consisted 
of the usual crew and a dozen senior 
scientists and space experts in hiber- 
nation. 

Del’s eyes lit up with pride of 
recognition. “Karel,” he murmured. 
“Karel was one of them, wasn’t he?” 



INHERITANCE 



11 




Shevan didn’t answer. 

The expedition was recalled as 
soon as the Galactic Council had 
made its decision on withdrawal (she 
continued), but the plague was so 
violent in Thetis that the withdrawal 
had to be carried out before the 
expedition could make it home. 
When it did get back to Thetis the 
Superom had gone. 

The survivors tried to reach the 
secret Galactic City at Mandanar to 
see whether it were possible to fol- 
low the retreat. But the Thetans were 
scared and bewildered because their 
leaders, planners and governors had 
fled. They wouldn’t allow the ex- 
pedition’s survivors to leave the land- 
ing site. They believed that while 
some Superom remained, Thetis 
would still have law, peace, prosper- 
ity. 

Del nodded vigorously. “Now tell 
about us, Shev. Tell about Shev and 
Del and Keren and Karel.” 

“We’re the last,” said the girl. 
“We’re the only four left of the 
remnant of those survivors. Several 
ages have passed since the return and 
we’ve dwindled away to four. Thetis 
has degenerated in a long series of 
dark ages. The cities are stone jungles 
that surround oases of calm in the 
old abandoned foodlands and mining 
areas. The highways connect the 
jungles, which the Helangles and the 
Conducs and the others own. 

“The Thetans still revere the 



Superom. Karel in his casket remains 
their god while he survives. Keren has 
almost become one of them. With his 
Thetan wives and children he liyes by 
providing the tribes with cruze to 
make fuel for their vehicles— cruze 
that you and I mine for him, Del.” 
The giant nodded eagerly. “So 
why do we have to go to Mandanar, 
Shewy? We work, we eat and have 
fun making things. You help me hunt 
the talues. We live okay, so why do 
we have to leave Spadrox and go to 
crazy old Mandanar?” 

For a moment it looked as though 
Shevan’s eyes were going to spill 
tears again, but she blinked them 
away. 

“Del, the sun’s going out. You 
recall when we found that library the 
Thetans had broken up because they 
couldn’t use the talk-tapes, don’t 
you?” 

He nodded, frowning, muttering, 
“Crazy smashed-up hole.” 

“It was all in there,” said Shevan. 
“Thetis’ history. The placing of the 
sun, its life-expectation. I intuited 
the talk-tapes and absorbed them. So 
we have to go to Mandanar.” 

Del shook his head. He didn’t 
really understand. 

“Because I can’t believe the old 
ones left without making some pro- 
vision for the Fifth Vortex expedi- 
tion survivors to follow them. It 
wouldn’t be possible for Superom to 
do that. They built Mandanar for a 



12 



IF 




purpose. No Thetans were allowed 
there. That’s where they guarded 
their secrets.” 

Del nodded again. Now he recalled 
it. But it was so difficult to follow all 
Shev’s reasons. He sat looking sadly 
at her small sandaled feet and think- 
ing how beautiful they were and 
maybe it would have been better if 
she were just beautiful and beautiful 
and beautiful like a bird or a young 
talue and not intelligent and philo- 
sophical like the old ones who went 
away. 

ASOFT descending cry divided 
their silence. It came from a 
spread of grass tussocks and bushes 
about fifty meters away. 

Del’s frown dissolved and his face 
recovered its seraphic preoccupation. 

“Talue, Shev. Let’s go hunt 
them.” 

She watched him. He was already 
on his feet, head cocked. She didn’t 
follow and the moment he turned 
away she knew she was forgotten. 

He moved softly and gracefully, as 
if his giant’s frame were made of 
light and air. 

He flitted from tussock to bush in 
the twilight, new slingbow poised. He 
could throw his voice with the same 
speed and accuracy as one of 
his missiles. It was uncanny to hear 
the sound spring up ten meters away 
from him. 

Shevan watched. Del’s call had 



lured one of the sleek creatures. It 
sat up, looking from side to side, but 
flickered away like a thought before 
Del even had time to aim the sling- 
bow. 

He tried again, moving softly 
farther into the brake and circling. 
He was facing Shevan now. He called 
the creature again three times. 
Shevan saw that the call did not even 
move his lips. 

The fourth time a young talue 
male jetted from bush to tussock and 
sniffed the setting sun. Del’s fifth 
caU, projected to rise uncannily from 
the ground at its feet, stunned it for 
long enough. A silver bolt streaked 
through the air and caught it behind 
the right foreleg. 

Its short whoop of dismay sent the 
rest of the pack starring out from 
hiding like the jets from a blue- 
white fountain. All but two went out 
of range before the giant could fire 
and reload. He hit both. 

He collected the catch and came 
back to Shevan, grinning happily. 
The top half of his body was a 
silhouette against the huge pink dish 
of the Thetan sunset. The girl’s heart 
moved at his contented child’s face. 

Del rubbed the palm of his hand 
against his black skullcap of hair. 

“Hell, that was good fun out 
there, Shev.” He sat down beside her 
and sighed. He spread out the blue- 
white talues lovingly. “Why didn’t 
you come?”

“I wanted to watch you. You do it 
so well.” 

Real pleasure sprang from the 
giant’s eyes. He put out a hand and 
touched Shev’s face. 

“Let’s see if we’re lucky.” Slim 
fingers began exploring the talue’s 
store pouches. 

The talue used them for storing 
the stones and other fragments it 
mined in its burrows in the search for 
Thetan fire-ore. The ore gave light 
and warmth to the shivering, slow- 
growing young in their nests. 

The young specinien that had been 
Del’s first victim was still a novice. 
Its pouch yielded nothing but frag- 
ments of rock crystal. The second, a 
mature female, had two grape-sized 
pieces of expired fire-ore, which Del 
tossed aside with a shrug, but the 
third, an old male, gave up a frag- 
ment of treasure among lesser stones. 
With a gurgle of pleasure, the giant 
let the pearl-sized piece of stored fire 
fall from his palm into Shevan’s. 

She felt its hoarded warmth caress 
her skin. Closing her hand for a 
moment she stared down at the fist it 
made and saw light escaping like 
water between her fingers. 

After a moment she gave the ore 
back to Del. He put it into a pouch. 
Fire-ore was good currency with 
some of the lesser Thetans who 
believed it had healing qualities. 

Shevan stood up suddenly. “Lis- 
ten, Del.” 



The giant rose swiftly, pressing a 
new bolt into his slingbow. The top 
of Shevan’s head reached only to his 
bicep as they stood together. 

Distant, rectangular crags of the 
stone jungles ringed their horizon. 
From one of them came the concert- 
ed snarl of high-powered engines. 

“The air car,” cried Shevan. 
“Quick!” She began to run. 

The drugged talues stirred uneasily 
as though caught by the same ur- 
gency. 

^^HEY had left the aircar on the 
^ far side of the observatory j 
where the slope of the hill concealed 
it from the highway. They ran be- 
tween the hill and the brush where 
Del had been hunting a few minutes 
before. 

Del was in front. Ahead of him the 
sun was a pink fingertip, huge and 
godlike, sinking behind some distant 
city. Behind them the stone jungle 
released the sound of a swarm of 
giant wasps to the open air as a 
Helangle scout party hit the highway 
at 80 kph. Beams from their power- 
ful headlamps rode up to the sky. 

“Del!” Shevan’s cry was almost 
drowned by the approaching tumult. 

Delbet turned in time to see her 
stagger a few steps more, then fall. 
He ran back, looking anxiously at the 
spears of light flying along the high- 
way. 

“My foot— a rock—” 



14 



IF 




Del kneeled beside her. Blood was 
spilling from a gash in the sole of her 
right foot. The sandal strap was 
almost severed. 

“Come on, Shewy. Up you 
come—” He slipped his arms behind 
her shoulders and under her knees 
and swung her into his arms. 

Loaded now, he still ran easily, 
loping through bushes, jumping talue 
humps. The aircar came into sight, 
tilted slightly on the hillside, where 
its telescopic legs had supported it 
but had not kept it level. 

“Oh no!’ The giant’s groan as he 
pulled up made Shevan forget her 
injury. She turned and looked. 

She flung up a hand to her face. 
Blood dripped onto Del’s coveralls. 
The unmistakable lights of another 
Helangle scout party skidded and 
slithered from side to side across the 
sky as the riders dusted erratically 
across country out of the last sliver 
of sun. 

There wasn’t any doubt they were 
converging on the aircar in spite of 
the wild confusion of their lights. 
Their coming had been muffled by 
the more concerted roar of the 
swarm jetting along the highway and 
by the bulk of the observatory hill. 

Del rushed forward again. 

‘Try to make the aircar.” Shevan’s 
face was white. Her arm went around 
the giant’s neck. 

Del sped, but he wasn’t going to 
make it. Three beams of light sliced 



the skin of darkness, fumbled, but 
held the two Superom in a blinding 
cone. 

The aircar was still about twenty 
meters away when the leading 
Helangle tracked around in an arc, 
his withered, booted leg scorching a 
channel in the soil. A moment later 
two more of. them were between Del 
and Shevan and their hope of flight. 

Del swung the girl easily to the 
ground. He shouted something word- 
less as he leveled the slingbow. 

“Don’t fight, Del,” Shevan panteti, 
holding on to him. 

There were about twenty 
Helangles in the scout party. Most of 
them were on the scene now. They 
kept the motors of their steedes 
roaring as they ringed the two 
Superom. 

They were Thetan humans but 
their faces always looked the same, 
dehumanized under identical crash 
hats and tinted goggles. They had 
survived the Thetan dark ages be- 
cause of their speed and mobility and 
their willingness to act as mercenaries 
to the highest ^bidder. 

The Helangles found identity in 
their skin jackets. They were sewn or 
painted with a variety of emblems 
and exhortations in their colorfpl, 
monosyllabic language. Each one had 
his equally exotic name studded 
across the shoulders of his jacket. 

The one who had arrived first had 
a star painted on his helmet to 



inheritance 



15 




identify him as leader. Starhowl in 
hand-high letters was studded across 
his shoulders. He gunned his engine 
hard and then let it die with a snarl. 
The others followed his example. 

Starhowl kicked down the support 
and heaved his steede up onto it. He 
swung his right leg over the motor 
and stood upright while he touched 
his helmet with both hands in the 
salute of recognition to superiors. 
Then he sank to the customary 
Helangle orouch, supporting himself 
on one hand. 

The Helangle s had spent thousands 
of nomadic years riding their steedes 
and evolutionary logic had wasted 
their legs. 

“Hi, Delbet Sir. Hi, Sievan Lady, 
Keren sent us. Yawl wrong. Yawl 
come back to Spadrox. Keren says 
yawl crazy out liere. Night come 
down. Yawl come back your pad. 
But quickly, man. Dig?” 

Del growled and took a threaten- 
ing step toward Starhowl. The 
crouching Helangle was dwarfed, but 
he didn’t flinch. 

A young scout with the name 
Arcweld glowing luminously from his 
hunched back flared his engine into 
noisy life behind the giant. He aimed 
the steede at Del. 

Shevan said. “Del, don’t!” 

“He don’t dig,” shouted Arcweld 
to his companions. “We hold 
Superom. Yawl come back Spadrox. 
Superom pad is Spadrox. Keren says 



so. Yawl Lady! You dig. Tell big 
boy. Superom not leave Spadrox 
pad. Dig?” 

“Dig,” said Shevan quietly, an- 
swering him in his own language. 
“Yawl hit bad trouble yawl rumble 
Delbet Sir. Delbet Sir Suprom’s big 
man some day. Why Helangles not 
hear Shevan Lady, Delbet Sir? Not 
Keren. Keren’s heavy. We’re going 
Mandanar. We’ll make Thetis great 
again.” 

Starhowl gestured impatiently at 
Arcweld. The latter cut his engine. 
The second Helangle scout party 
from the highway had arrived now. 
Its leader was called Smoketrail. He 
got off his bike with the same defer- 
ence to the Superom as Starhowl. He 
obviously had the same message to 
convey, but Starhowl waved him 
down impatiently. 

“Shed, man. Dig it. Shevan Lady 
says go Mandanar. Make Thetis great 
again.” 

“Nix!” Smoketrail, who was more 
powerful and much uglier than Star- 
howl, hammered one fist on the 
ground. “Yawl blown your mind, 
man. Suprom leave Spadrox, Thetis 
nix. Suprom stay Spadrox pad like 
always. With Karel. TTiat’s history, 
man. Never hit road like Helangles. 
Stay Spadrox. Thetis okay. Dig?” 

“Dig!” All the featureless heads 
nodded agreement. Smoketrail’s 
statement was Helangle logic. 

“Yawl come on Spadrox right 



16 



IF 




now, Shevan Lady, Delbet Sir,” said 
Starhowl. 

Del looked appealingly at Shevan. 
She shook her head. There was noth- 
ing to be done. 

Several of the Helangles got busy. 
They slung litters between four of 
the steedes. Ordinarily they used 
them for carrying their pregnant 
women or very small children on 
long journeys. Deferentially, trying 
not to touch the Superom, they 
encouraged them to climb in. 

They set their engines in motion 
with shouts of satisfaction and en- 
couragement to one another. They 
ignored the air car. They wouldn’t 
have dared touch it, anyway. It was 
Superom equipment. Keren would 
have to make arrangements to re- 
cover it. 

Like a menacing wasp swarm cling- 
ing around a pair of queens they 
bucked, bounced and swept around 
the hill and then howled triumphant- 
ly down the highway in a black mass 
heading toward the stone jungles 
and, beyond them, the sacred enclave 
of the Superom at Spadrox.

T he night was half through. The 
primeval Thetan sun was a flat, 
purplish glow, like a strange cloud 
edging the horizon. 

Keren had been roused from his 
bed and his Thetan wives by the

noise of the returning mission. He 
waited for the recaptured fugitives 
just outside the quadrangle of one- 
story buildings that formed Spadrox. 
Directly behind him at the quad- 
rangle’s center, sliding high into the 
night, was the needle tower that 
housed Karel’s casket. The Superom 
Regent had roused five of his aides. 
They were grouped on his left, look- 
ing untidy and annoyed about their 
broken sleep. 

Keren was not much bigger physi- 
cally than Shevan, but his long black 
hair, the sharp beard streaked with 
gray and the immense, dark eyes 
staring out of his bony face made 
him a fearsome wizard in that strange 
light. 

The Helangles kept a respectful 
distance. They stopped their motors 
and let Shevan and Delbet get out of 
the litters about fifty meters from 
the waiting Regent. All of them 
raised both hands to touch the fronts 
of their crash hats. 

As soon as Keren had returned this 
salute they swung their steedes around 
and fired their motors. Their tumult 
and their lances of light were soon 
swallowed in the darkness. 

Shevan and Del were left alone. 
Although the girl was weary and 
covered with grime and still confused 
by the noise of the journey, she 
straightened herself, brushed a sleeve 
over her face and hair and walked 
disdainfully toward her cousin. Their 



eyes, so alike in power and character, 
met on equal terms. 

Del followed her, but he was 
worried. He hung his head in the face 
of Keren’s silent anger. He stopped a 
few paces behind Shevan. 

The Regent addressed them both. 
His voice was like acid. He spoke in 
the Superom high tongue, so his 
aides wouldn’t understand. 

“So, cousins. What did you expect 
to achieve when you left Spadrox? 
There’s no place on Thetis for 
Superom except here.” 

“I shall go where I choose.” 
Shevan’s voice had a bite. “You tell 
me what right you had to send those 
faceless dwarfs after us. We are 
Superom.” 

“Yes, I’ll tell you, cousin. I had 
the duty to maintain order in Thetis. 
What do you think would happen if 
the Thetans saw the last Superom 
community breaking up? They 
would believe we were trying to leave 
Thetis— as the old ones did. They 
would kill us rather than let us go 
aad they would take Karel for them- 
selves.” 

“You damned fool, Keren. Leave 
Thetis is what we should do. If we 
don’t the sun will kill us as well as 
the Thetans.” 

“Childish rubbish. Our sun will 
last many thousands of years. 
There’ll be plenty of warning in the 
climate decline long before there’s 
any danger.” 



18 



IF 




“And I contradict that. The talk- 
tapes explained it all. The artificial 
sun will go on providing equal light 
and warmth throughout the decline. 
What happens is that as its bulk 
reduces it just consumes itself faster 
and faster.” 

“Talk-tapes?” sneered Keren. 
“Only you have told us about these 
magic tapes. Where are they? What 
can you prove?” 

Shevan flung her fist into the air. 

“You had them destroyed. You 
had them destroyed because you 
couldn’t intuit and absorb them. You 
had them destroyed because I could 
understand them and you couldn’t, 
cousin. Because I’m true Superom 
and you’re not! That’s what I 
prove!” 

“Stop it.” Keren stepped forward 
furiously. “How dare you?” He 
switched back to Thetan, spitting 
words over his shoulder to the wait- 
ing aides. “This is enough. Take 
Delbet back to the cruze mine. He’s 
as stupid as he’s big and the girl’s to 
blame— but he has to learn. Give him 
a neuro-whipping— but so that he’s 
still able to control the machines 
tomorrow, eh? Go, It’s for the good 
of Superom!” 

“No,” said Shevan, “Don’t touch 
Delbet. I frightened him into going 
with me. He isn’t to blame. He tried 
to get me to come back.” 

The aides stopped and looked un- 
certainly at Keren, their neuroprobes 



already drawn. They were grim, 
powerful specimens, half Conduc, 
half product of Keren’s marriages 
with various Thetan females, but 
although they carried the blood they 
would never challenge a Superom 
order. Their minds were in conflict. 

“Take him,” snapped Keren. “I’ll 
deal with Miss Shevan.” 

Del looked in panic at the girl. His 
mouth opened, but he didn’t speak. 

“Keren, tell them no neuro-whip- 
ping.” 

“Take him to the mine,” the 
Regent repeated. He didn’t look at 
anyone but Shevan. After a few 
dragging seconds he added: “Leave 
him without the punishment. I have 
a better idea to teach them sense.” 
The aides moved away, Delbet 
white-faced and grimy among them. 
“You come with me, cousin.” 

“I’m going to my quarters at the 
mine,” said Shevan haughtily. 

For the barest instant Keren’s rage 
was deflated. He swung around with 
a short laugh like an animal’s bark. 
His face broke into the briefest of 
smiles at Shevan’s impudence. 

“Do you want me to have that 
tree-sized baby neuro-whipped after 
all? Come with me— don’t argue.” 

She followed him, furious but 
beaten. 



HERE did you hope to go, 
my dear cuz?” Keren asked.

“What exactly was your plan?” He 
rocked back in his chair behind the 
broad table in his conference room. 

“Find out— cuz.” The derisive 
pause before she spat out the usually 
affectionate diminutive made 
Shevan’s response waspish. 

Keren wasn’t provoked. He was 
relaxed and controlled itow. 

“You won’t ever get far from 
Spadrox, my beloved tree tigress. 
You know the Helangles have a 
saying-the Conducs and the others 
have it, too, but I find the Helangle 
dialect so expressive, don’t you? 
They say: ‘Spadrox Suprom pad, 
Suprom belong Spadrox.’ And you 
know, they have this weird notion 
that while we stay, Thetis is saved 
and the Superom Commonwealth 
will come again. So why are you so 
damned mischievous you try to upset 
the status quo?” He crashed his fist 
suddenly onto the table so that 
Shevan, with all her self-possession, 
jumped. “What do you think you’re 
doing?” 

After a moment she said, “I want 
to be far away from you, cousin. As 
far as possible.” 

Keren rocked the chair forward. 
He leaned over, the table. His hands 
slid across it towards her. His eyes 
fixed hers, taunting her with the 
truth she thought he hadn’t known. 

“You won’t ever get to Mandanar, 
Shevan. Mandanar has ceased to exist 
except as history. The old ones de- 



stroyed it five hundred years ago 
when they abandoned the planet.” 
“No!” 

“Yes, my dear. You’d much better 
stay at Spadrox with me and we’ll 
invent a new Thetis one day. Quite 
soon, now.” 

“No.” 

“You’ll see. For all their primi- 
tivism the Thetans will be proved 
right. Suprom will rule again in the 
Fourth Vortex.” 

Shevan leaned forward, too, but 
only to throw words into his grinning 
face. “It may happen. But not that 
way. Not your ,way. Not if I’m 
forced to tear out your heart ^ with 
my own hands first, Keren.” 

He clicked his tongue. “Now, cuz, 
what do you mean?” 

“You know what I mean. You 
know that I understand too well 
what you mean. But you wouldn’t 
dare speak it and I would yomit if I 
heard the words or had to come 
closer to the ideas in them or con- 
sider them more capable of realiza- 
tion than I do now.” 

Keren shook his head. The smile 
was still there, but it was fixed, 
frozen somehow by Shevan’s passion. 

“We’ll see, cousin. Meanwhile, I 
must detach that poor giant from 
your corrupting influence. Perhaps 
that will punish him more than the 
neuroprobes. From tomorrow you 
will be lodged in Karel’s Tower and 
be responsible for our sleeping lead-

er. The tree tigress— High Priestess of 
the Tower! How does that strike 
you?” 

A ll day and all night the tip of 
the tower, aimed at the sky, 
listened for messages. There had been 
none for more than six hundred 
years but the tower went on listening 
patiently. It read the faint light and 
the bright light from distant and near 
stars. It heard the blurred symphony 
of galaxies, the clock of pulsars— it 
listened for the last, receding glow of 
the Superom in the Outer Vortices. 
The delicate instruments set up by its 
stranded creators were always ready 
to sift and interpret a flicker of hope 
from among the millions of meaning- 
less symbols that shone through 
them. Its cone fed on light and its 
multilensed sides drank liglit, but at 
its base was a windowless vault where 
the darkness was six hundred years 
old. 

Shevan had been inside the tower 
before but had never stayed more 
than a few minutes. When her eyes 
became accustomed to the deep 
shadow she recognized the pale 
greenish glow at the vault’s center. 
Within it, Karel’s casket rested on a 
low dais. 

The old leader was visible, but 
absolutely motionless. The biopack 
that preserved his skin covered him 
except for his head, but the uniform

collar of the Space Elite Superom 
still showed at his throat. Only the 
machines, which supported a minute 
spark of life, and the timeless in- 
struments, which confirmed it and re- 
corded his vital functions, throbbed 
and occasionally clicked in the still- 
ness. No other sound disturbed 
Karel’s vast sleep. 

A quick pulse of light beat once in 
the darkness. A circular door had 
opened and closed at the far end of 
the vault. 

The pulse had admitted a figure. 
Now the darkness beyond the faint 
luminosity of Karel’s casket held it 
invisibly. 

“Who’s there?” Shevan challenged. 
“Who are you?” 



INHERITANCE 



21 





“I have forgotten my name,” said 
the darkness. “I have always been 
here. I am trained to look after the 
casket and maintain the instruments. 
I have no other purpose.” 

“Come here,” said Shevan. “I am 
Shevan Lady.” Her heart had begun 
to beat normally again. 

A shadow moved toward her. It 
passed the casket like a breath of air 
and ancient dust. She had already 
guessed its identity. 

To itself, perhaps, it had no name 
but to everyone in Spadrox it was 
Shade. In silence and invisibility 
Shade kept the tower and tended 
Karel’s casket, read the instruments, 
awaited messages or the end of 
Karel’s long sleep. Some said he was 
Superom who had survived the 
plague with his reason impaired, that 
he was as old as Karel himself. Others 
said that Shade did not exist, that 
the tower maintained itself, as did 
the casket and the instruments, and 
that disbelief among many in the 
power of the old Superom had made 
it necessary to invent a legendary 
keeper of the tower. 

No one had seen him. On the days 
when the vault was opened for hom_- 
age to the sleeping leader. Shade was 
never there. He had some niche in 
the darkness or in the fabric of the 
tower or of the air itself into which 
he melted. His presence was attested 
to only by the inunaculate machin- 
ery, the sense of order, the unfailing 



instruments. Shade had held the 
tower for the Superom since before 
Keren’s birth. Keren had not seen 
him either, knew him only as a voice 
from the same darkness that now 
questioned Shevan. 

“You are Superom?” 

“1 am Shevan Lady, Keren Sir’s 
cousin.” 

The darkness repeated the answer 
softly: “Shevan-Keren’s cousin.” 

Shevan noticed that although 
Shade spoke in Thetan he didn’t use 
the “Sir” or “Lady” suffix, as was 
mandatory when addressing or speak- 
ing about Superom. 

The voice had seemed to come 
from behind her. She turned, at the 
same time moving backward a step or 
two, trying to bring the creature into 
the light from the casket. 

“I am to learn how the tower 
works. I have to know the function- 
ing of the casket and all the instru- 
ments.” Shevan pushed the moist 
palms of her hands down her thighs 
to dry them. The darkness before her 
seemed utterly dead, utterly un- 
tenanted. 

From her left the voice said, “So, I 
am to be extinguished. You have 
been sent by Keren to trap me.” 

Quite suddenly Shevan was seized 
from behind. A collar of darkness 
gripped her throat. Vivid lights vol- 
leyed from the corners of her ^yes to 
blind her. 

The throttling grip was so fierce it 



22 



IF 




prevented her from crying out. She 
tried to tear it away. The hands were 
as light and dry as the bones of a 
small bird, but they held like a vise. 

In desperation, whirlwinds howl- 
ing in her ears, she flung herself 
forward. The attacker was caught off 
guard. The awful grip broke as he 
fell. Scrambling sideways, Shevan 
cried out: “Great Karel, help me! I 
am Keren’s prisoner! Help me!” 

Inside the casket Karel didn’t stir 
in his six-hundred-year sleep. The 
darkness listened to Shevan’s jagged 
sobs. She remained kneeling, expect- 
ing another attack. 

When the light, ancient hands re- 
turned she screamed so that the 
tower echoed, but the hands were 
gentle this time. Still she threw her- 
self sideways to escape— they fol- 
lowed her. 

“Delbet!” she screamed. 

The hands explored her face and 
neck. They ran like a breath of air 
over the contours of her body. She 
tried to protect herself, hunched 
over. 

Into the unreason of her panic 
came a black thought. Shade didn’t 
exist as a separate entity— Keren and 
Shade were two projections of the 
same being. 

She shrieked, “Delbet! Delbet—” 
again. 

But the voice behind the hands in 
the darkness whispered, “Forgive me. 
You are only a child. Forgive me. 



Please. I did not understand.” 
Shevan stayed trembling on the 
floor. The hands left her. 

“I will look after you,” the dark- 
ness promised her, “as I look after 
Great Karel.” 

Shevan felt her aching throat. 
“Who are you?” she croaked. “Please 
help me to escape from here.” 

The darkness pondered. “I have 
forgotten my name,” it said forlorn- 
ly. “I have always been here. Why do 
you want to escape?” 

“I must go to Mandanar.” 
“Mandanar!” The darkness whisp- 
ered the name. “Mandanar!” Long 
moments passed. 

Then the voice returned. It had a 
different tone, hostile, reproachful, 
and it was farther from Shevan now. 
“You make me afraid. Why do you 
want to go to Mandanar? Why has 
Keren shut you in here? You are 
Superom. Superom do not mistreat 
one another. I am afraid of you.” 
“The sun is burning out,” said 
Shevan. “I must go to Mandanar to 
see whether there’s any hope of 
escape from Thetis. Keren doesn’t 
believe me. The future he invents for 
me in his thoughts is wicked. He 
believes I created the tale of the sun 
to escape from him.” 

“I don’t like you,” said the voice 
remotely. “You’re a child and I 
won’t hurt you, but I wish you 
hadn’t come here. I can’t understand 
any of this.”

“Don’t go-” 

“I don’t understand,” insisted the 
darkness. “I wish you hadn’t come.” 

The pulse of light that had an- 
nounced its entry to the vault beat 
again. 

“Shade!” Shevan called. “I didn’t 
want to come here. Help me to 
escape.” 

There was no answer. She was 
alone in the vault with the sleeping 
god of Thetis. 

441JOW are you getting on with 

•H Shade, tree tigress?” asked 
Keren. His head and shoulders had 
materialized on a communicator 
screen set in one wall of the tower’s 
computer complex. 

“Shade- who is Shade, cousin?” 
Shevan turned her back on the 
screen, pretending to be engrossed in 
an input feeder. 

She had been a prisoner in Karel’s 
tower for about a week. Although he 
had not come to the tower in person, 
Keren had formed the habit of turn- 
ing up on the screens at all hours of 
the day, so that she had little privacy 
even in her own restricted living 
quarters. 

She always tried to ignore or anger 
him, but he refused to be provoked. 
He remained amused and a little 
aloof but always ready to exploit any 
sign that her will was faltering. When 
his intrusions became too persistent 
she retreated to the vault where there 



was no light save the glow bathing 
the casket and no screens were per- 
mitted. 

“So— I’m to understand the spirit 
of the tower has ignored you?” 
Keren was in one of his bantering 
moods. She recognized it and circled 
the input bank, keeping her back to 
the screen. 

“What spirit? Have you ever seen 
Shade, cousin?” 

“I’ve heard him,” said Keren. 
“He’s spoken to me.” 

“Poor deluded creature.” Shevan 
made the comment as though to 
herself, but purposely loud enough 
for the Regent to hear. 

Keren chuckled. “Well, cuz, be- 
lieve whatever fantasies please you. 
But you aren’t so foolish as to 
dismiss the uncanny way the tower 
works. Shade is there all right. He’s 
watching you.” - 

“I do feel that I’m being 
watched,” said Shevan with quiet 
anger. “But it isn’t Shade who’s 
watching me, cousin— it’s you. When 
are you going to stop this bloody 
game and let me out? I demand to be 
released.” 

She swung around, her eyes blaz- 
ing at the screen; In the next instant 
she wished she hadn’t, recognizing 
the sinister look in her cousin’s eyes. 

“I’m watching you grow up, cuz,” 
he said. “It gives me pleasure to see 
yesterday’s little cub becoming to- 
morrow’s tigress.” 



24 



IF 




“Burn in hell!” Shevan invited 
him, hiding her sudden unease with a 
great gust of anger. 

Keren was unmoved. “Until 
soon,” he said, using a Thetan expres- 
sion. “Remember me to Shade.” 

The screen became blank. 

As soon as she felt certain that he 
was no longer watching or listening, 
Shevan called, “Shade-Shade-” 

The tower remained silent. In fact, 
since the terrifying d^wn when she 
had first entered the vault, Shevan 
had neither seen nor heard its keeper. 
He had once more fused with the air 
or the old shadows surrounding 
Karel’s casket. 

She had tried to raise him several 
times. In spite of his hostility she 
believed she still could persuade him 
to help her escape to Mandanar 
because of the almost spell-like effect 
the name had had on him. But he 
wouldn’t reveal himself. 

Shevan remembered his reproach- 
ful: I don*t like you. / can't under^ 
stand any of thi^ . 

And now Shade stayed stubbornly 
silent and out of reach. 

She knew he was there. The read- 
ings from the casket instruments 
were always brought up and dutifully 
fed into the computer for analysis. 
The hundreds of light signals the 
tower received every day were always 
classified and anything that was only 
marginally out of the ordinary was 
cross-checked and broken down. The 



micrologs were always up to date. 

All this being attended to left 
Shevan with nothing to occupy her 
mind but escape. From the fourth 
story of the tower she could just see 
the bright cone that marked the 
cruze mine. It was too remote for her 
to be able to distinguish figures, but 
Shevan thought of Delbet working 
there on his beloved machines, per- 
haps wondering what had happened 
to her. 

She tried once to smuggle a mes- 
sage to him. Keren had food sent to 
the tower twice a day. One of the 
aides who brought it was more ap- 
proachable than the others. Shevan 
had asked, him whether he knew 
Delbet and if the giant was all right. 

“Delbet Sir’s okay. He works the 
cruze mine.” 

“Did Keren Sir hurt him? Was he 
neuro-whipped?” 

“He’s okay. Keren Sir didn’t hurt 
him. He’s very happy. He knows all 
about the machines over there.” 

“Do you ever go over there?” 

“Sometimes, ma’am. Delbet Sir is 
very kind. He understands the ma- 
chines very well. He even talks to 
them.” 

“There are many interesting ma- 
chines here in the tower. Delbet Sir 
would like them. I’d like to tell him 
about some of them. I’ve written 
about one or two and I want you to 
take him what I’ve written when you 
go to the mine again.”

“No.” The aide backed into the 
tunnel that was the only approach to 
Karel’s vault from the outside. He 
had drawn a neuroprobe and al- 
though he kept it respectfully low- 
ered Shevan didn’t doubt that Keren 
had told him to use it if it 
meant preventing her escape. So the 
door closed on that attempt with her 
having achieved nothing but a cold 
meal and the certainty that the guard 
would be scared to speak to her 
again. 

Shevan had been into every acces- 
sible part of the tower several times. 
She could fmd no alternate way out 
or in— or any place where Shade 
might make his home. The door to 
Karel’s vault and the tunnel outside 
it were guarded night and day. 

Shevan lay on her bed. The sun 
was setting. Her plight filled her 
mind as the death of the sun filled 
the sky. She grew restless, arose and 
prowled through the computer com- 
plex on the floor below for the 
hundredth time. Even if she could 
escape her prison she wouldn’t get 
far from Spadrox without help. 
Keren had already proved that to her 
beyond question. She would need 
the help of the Thetan tribes— she 
would need a guide to Mandanar— she 
would need Delbet and, most im- 
portant, she would need to defeat 
Keren so decisively that he wouldn’t 
dare to pursue her or. try to bring her 
back. 



If Shade would come and talk to 
her she might learn something. If 
Karel would rouse from his half-life 
he would surely recognize her story 
and understand the approaching end 
of Thetis. At least these two could 
prove or disprove to her whether 
Mandanar still existed and whether 
the old ones had left their descen- 
dants any means of retreat to the 
Outer Vortices. 

A wild thought came into her 
head. She looked around at the vast 
number of units in the complex, all 
humming in a preoccupied way. 
They would never help her, but they 
suggested something that might 
work. She hurried down the tower. 
She tried to think as a Superom 
should, but her thoughts, still half- 
formed, were muddled and disjointed 
by apprehension. The circular door 
to the vault blinked open and shut 
like an eye after her as she passed 
through. 

As soon as her eyes were used to 
the darkness she approached the 
casket. Karel slept. 

“If only you could wake,” Shevan 
murmured. But the old leader 
couldn’t hear her. He lay neutral, the 
embodiment of man’s great memory 
of the spaces between galaxies. If any 
dreams passed through the six- 
hundred-year sleep they were benign 
and didn’t trouble him. His face was 
serene. 

Shevan breathed deeply. She 



26 



IF 




fancied she could hear her own heart 
beating. And as soon as she touched 
the instrument controls she knew her 
idea had been ill-conceived. It had 
been too hasty and panicky to be 
worthy of a Superom. She hadn’t 
considered all the possible conse- 
quences of her action— not even the 
obvious ones. 

Like a gust of air from a tomb 
Shade was through the blink of light 
and on her before she had even 
moved the hibemator setting a half 
calibration. Worse— a violent shock 
made her somersault backward. Was 
that shriek she heard her own? She 
hit the floor and squirmed up into a 
world of wavering light and alarms 
and running feet as the guards flung 
open the door and poured into the 
vault. The chill presence of Shade 
faded instantly into the shadows. 

Keren’s men caught her by the 
arms and legs and carried her back to 
her room on the fourth flight. She 
fought like a captured animal. Keren 
came to direct his men. 

The casket was unharmed, but the 
Regent had lost the temper he had 
held in check. 

“Strip her,” he ordered. 

Fighting, cursing, biting, scratch- 
ing the hands that laid her naked, 
Shevan saw his gaunt face and read in 
it what he meant to do. She calmed 
suddenly, awfully. 

“No, you half-breed! I am 
Superom. You can’t.” 



“Stand away from her,’ said 
Keren. The guards backed up. “You 
are foolish, cousin. You tried to 
meddle with the casket. You might 
have killed Karel and brought dis- 
aster to all of us.” 

“I didn’t mean to hurt Great 
Karel. I wanted to try to rouse him 
so he would save me from you.” 

“You fool. You are growing up, 
but a lesson or two won’t harm 
you.” 

“No—” Shevan put up her hand in 
a purely instinctive gesture, staving 
off nothing. 

The Regent used the neuroprobe 
with cruel precision. Her mouth open 
in a soundless scream, Shevan jack- 
knifed. Two slim lances of pain had 
suddenly been exchanged for her 
legs. 

“Get out.” Keren’s snarl sent the 
guards scurrying. 

“You bastard-you bastard—” 
Shevan’s own voice was shouting 
through the long slender pain, but 
the pain wouldn’t stop. 

As she writhed away from him and 
it, Keren bent down suddenly and 
pressed his bearded lips against her 
left thigh. It was an entirely passion- 
less gesture. He seemed merely deter- 
mined to make her associate her 
anguish with his power over her. 

“Don’t do anything foolish again, 
cousin,” he said softly. “You are my 
prisoner. I have you. You are part of 
my future. I can’t let you go.”

Ill 

O HEVAN cried well into the 
^ night. While she cried, the parox- 
ysms of her throat and chest and the 
ache through her eyes helped to 
relieve the pain in her legs. 

Exhausted finally, she drifted into 
a sleep crowded with dreams. Frag- 
ments of them refused to link to- 
gether, although somevdiere she in- 
tuited a coherent theme in them. 
Every time she awoke the fragments 
broke away and, weeping, she came 
back to consciousness and a dull ache 
in her legs. 

In her dreams Karel’s voice seemed 
to come to her from everywhere in 
the tower— every where but the casket 
in which he kept his own sound 
sleep. Delbet dressed her with his 
strong giant’s hands and they ran 
away from Spadrox again. Shevan 
rediscovered the talk-tapes in the 
library. From the charred ruins of 
evening a young talue leaped up. 
With its deceptive cry it lured Delbet 
into a broken arch of the observatory 
against the dying sun. ‘*No!” Shevan 
cried in her dream. The talue flung a 
meteorite of fire-ore from its pouch 
and toppled the giant. As he fell 
Delbet ’s voice rang clearly from the 
casket in a lightless vault: “I’ll listen 
carefully, Shev. I won’t get it wrong 
this time. What does it mean? I can’t 
understand.” 

Shevan awoke. Tears were running 



down her pale face in streams. 

“What did you dream?” a voice 
breathed from the night just above. 

“I dreamed my escape,” she said. 

“I wish you wouldn’t keep cry- 
ing,” the voice said impatiently. 
Then, after a pause: “I knew no good 
would come of it. I wish you’d never 
been locked up here. I wish I’d never 
set eyes on you.” 

Shevan realized that both voices, 
hers and the other one, were real and 
not part of her dream. She sat up. 
Someone had carefully and gently 
put her back in her coveralls. The 
pain was gone. It was still night. 

“Who is it?” 

“How stupid you are for a 
Superom. I’ve told you more than 
once that I no longer have a name. 
Perhaps I never had one—” 

“Shade,” said Shevan with relief. 

“—or even wanted one.” The voice 
paused. “Why did you try to hurt 
Great Karel? That was exceptionally 
silly.” 

“I didn’t mean to harm him. Yes, 
it was silly. I hadn’t applied logic. 
But I thought if he could be roused 
Keren would have to set me free’’ 

The ugly recollection of Keren and 
\vdiat he had done to her brought 
tears to her eyes again. 

“Oh, do stop, girl!” scolded the 
voice.' “You’ve already cried enough 
to flood Spadrox. I can’t endure 
your weeping the whole night. Listen 
to me— what did you dream?” 



28 



IF 




Shevan wiped her eyes. She re- 
membered. “Great Karel! I saw it. 
How did you know?” 

“Know what?” said Shade. “I 
didn’t know anything. I just heard 
you say it. I wish you would escape. 
I’m afraid of you. You’re a danger- 
ous child. And you’re even more 
dangerous because you’re the last. 
But I said I would look after you, 
too. And I saw what the half-breed 
Keren did to you. So I’ll help you,” 
“I must speak to Delbet,” said 
Shevan wildly, getting up from her 
bed. “Help me to get a message to 
him,” 

“The giant with the saint’s face 
who works the cruze?” 

“Yes.” 

“It’s too far,” said Shade. “In less 
than an hour the dawn will start. Go 
to sleep now. You must wait another 
day. I’ll come back tomorrow night 
and take you to the mine.” 

“No,” said Shevan. “No, I don’t 
want to leave the tower just yet. You 
must bring Delbet here. Please.” 

The darkness embraced a mo- 
ment’s incredulous silence. “You 
don’t want to leave the tower?’ 

“Not yet. When I escape I want to 
be sure that Keren knows— and that 
he can’t make me return.” 

“I don’t understand. You made 
me afraid from the beginning. You’re 
a strange child.” 

“Will you bring Delbet to me?” 
“Very well.” 



“Tomorrow?” 

“After nightfall. The day would be 
impossible.” 

“I’ll endure the wait.” 

“And for now, you can sleep.” 

It was incredible that a few hours 
before she had been in such depths 
of pain and despair that they seemed 
to have no end or relief. In spite of 
Shade’s advice she couldn’t sleep. 
For the short time left before dawn 
her mind struggled with half-dreams 
and a repetitive agony of speculation. 

She did endure the day, but un- 
willingly, hiding her fears from Keren 
under an icy mask of injured pride 
and contempt. Her cousin appeared 
frequently on the screens. It was 
almost as though he suspected the 
plan shaping and reshaping in her 
head. But she could tell from the 
sullen air beneath his reproaches and 
scoldings that he regretted what he 
had inflicted on her. 

She ignored him utterly, pretend- 
ing to be busy, but always waiting 
for night. It came and with the 
darkness Shade returned, a breath of 
dusty earth and dry leaves accom- 
panying his presence. 

“Wait half an hour,” he whispered. 
‘Then go down to the vault and stay 
there till we come.” 



D EL!” 

“Shevan? That you?” The 
young giant leaned forward, peering 



INHERITANCE 



29 




in from the peripheral darkness of 
the vault. 

“Del! Del, darling!” She rushed to 
hug him. Her arms would not 
quite go all the way around his chest. 

He swung her up and held her so 
that their faces were on the same 
level. 

“Why, now— it’s really you, Shev. 
What’s been happening to you?” 

Shevan noticed he had about him 
that faint scent of earth and dead 
leaves— like the smell that sometimes 
came with Shade. It suggested that, 
after all, there was a subterranean 
tunnel giving access to the tower. 
Maybe a secret tunnel that only 
Shade knew of and used. 

“Del— where’s Shade?” 

“Shade? Who’s that?” 

“You came here alone?” 

The giant put her dowm He did 
not answer her directly. “Hell, 
Shev,” he said, “I don’t like it here. 
It’s dark and scary. Hey— that’s Great 
Karel, isn’t it? Danm, I really don’t 
like it here. I’ye only seen the casket 
in the light when they have the 
Listening Festivals. What are you 
doing here?” 

“Del, I asked you, did you come 
alone?” She dug the nails of one 
hand into his forearm to make him 
listen. 

“It was queer.” Delbet rubbed his 
arm, then his face and his cap of 
black hair. “I was asleep and it was 
like a voice— a voice or something 



woke me and kind of told me— led 
me-” He was looking around him all 
the time, trying to penetrate the 
shadows. “Hell— then there was this 
talue or something going on ahead of 
me. Not making much sound. At last 
I came to a kind of hole or cave 
thing-it went into the hill. Then thQ 
voice— it sort of told me you wanted 
me . you know. But there wasn’t 
anyone there so I just came.” 

“Never mind, Del. You’re here. 
I’m here.” 

“SSiev. I’m scared. Keren would be 
wild if he found out.” 

“Keren-did he hurt you?” 

Del considered. He shook his head. 
“Not hurt. Not whipped or anything. 
Just-sort of said I wouldn’t be see- 
ing you again. Well, not for a long 
time anyway. Only that kind of 
hurt.” 

“Never mind— never mind.” She 
p>etted his arm as she might a baby’s. 
“Listen, Del, Keren’s bad. We have to 
leave him. We have to leave Spadrox 
and go to Mandanar. Keren locked 
me in the tower. We have to find a 
way to get to Mandanar before I can 
escape this place—” 

“No, Shev, no— not again. Now 
you calm right down, baby. We really 
aren’t going throu^ that again. Look 
at what happened last time.” He 
paced away from her, agitated— she 
heard rather than saw him circling 
Karel’s casket, beyond its ghostly 
green glow. 



30 



IF 




“Del. Del, dear. Don’t you want to 
see me again? Do you want me to 
stay locked up here?” 

Delbet whispered, “No—” but she 
couldn’t see his face. She didn’t 
know what he was denying or wheth- 
er he had even understood what she 
meant. Then: “Shev, it won’t work, 
baby. Look what happened last 
time.” 

“This time will be different. Come 
here. Listen to what we have to do.” 
She pursued and found him, caught 
his arm and made him stop prowling 
up and down. 

“Sit down, Del— here where I can 
see your face.” 

She pulled him down. He sat 
obediently, searching her face with 
frightened eyes. Shevan kneeled be- 
tween his knees, so that it was 
difficult for him to look at anything 
but her. Still he hung his head. 

She held his big hands tightly. 
“Listen. Listen carefully. I’m going 
to tell you how we’ll escape. You’ve 
got to help me, Del. We’re going to 
escape to Mandanar.” 

She could tell by the way the 
darkness moved suddenly and be- 
came taut and listening and excited 
that they were not alone. She could 
tell that the name she had just 
spoken was once more a spell— and 
she somehow knew that it didn’t 
matter if the darkness overheard her 
scheme while the spell held. She 
knew that she and Delbet would not 



go alone to Mandanar if her dream 
worked. 

In tense, rushed whispers she be- 
gan to tell the giant and the eaves- 
dropping darkness what she had 
dreamed and what he and she must 
do. 

first Conduc caravan arrived 
an hour after sunrise five days 
later. It consisted of about twenty of 
the usual beat-up old vehicles, some 
with as many as six passengers. It 
looked to Keren as if the drivers had 
picked up plenty of casual riders 
from the Conduc camps on the way. 
He saw at least four leaders among 
the arrivals and recognized Apian, 
one of the most troublesome and 
influential. 

He wondered >^at the problem 
was this time. Another wife-snatch- 
ing raid by the Helangles? A deputa- 
tion to demand more cruze for trade 
with the far metropols? Another 
petty wrangle over areas of influence 
on the highways or in the stone 
jungles? 

Shevan had no such misgivings. 
The sight of the caravan bouncing 
and rattling across the countryside 
from the nearest road ended a period 
of unbearable suspense for her. 

Every day since her meeting with 
Delbet— and the sweaty, agonizing 
hour die had spent in the vault, 
convincing, cajoling, bullying him— 
she had gone to the highest point in 



INHERITANCE 



31 




her prison and stayed there, hour 
after hour, watching the distant 
roads and the crouching towers that 
ringed the horizon until water flowed 
from her strained and staring eyes. 

She had watched from the first 
day, even though she had known that 
she was much too early. It would 
require at least two days for the 
cautious ancLreluctant Delbet to take 
the first step her plan demanded. But 
she had watched from the first mo- 
ment of daylight on that first day, 
growing progressively and unreason- 
ably more disillusioned and resigned 
as the first day and night had melted 
into a second, a third, into an agony 
of fatigue and despair during the 
fourth. 

Now they came: a somber, noisy 
motorcade, making unquestionably 
for Spadrox across the roadless coun- 
try between the enclave and the 
nearest highway. 

The Conduc vehicles and dress 
reflected the descent of the Conducs 
from highly skilled, mobile teams of 
auxiliaries who had helped the 
Superom in their space communica- 
tion network and orbiter stations. 
The black or deep blue or purple 
paintwork of their vehicles recalled 
the profound colors of space. Super- 
imposed on the paint in silver tones 
were crude representations of the 
most familiar constellations of the 
Fourth Vortex. 

The Conduc cousin tribes were 



often identified by these symbols 
and took the names of the constella- 
tions they represented: Mamaria 
Thebor, Tirax Alpegi, Lex Andro- 
meda, Caxitine. 

Apian was a Caxitine. Shevan saw 
the five major and seven minor stars 
in the rough diamond shape on the 
front of his caftan as he stepped 
from his slowing car, followed by the 
leaders of the Mamarian Theborans, 
Tirax Alpegiae and Lex Andro- 
medans. They lined up before the 
main entrance to Spadrox. With a 
final discordant blast upon klaxons 
of various notes and performances 
the caravan halted and the Conduc 
followers got out to form an ex- 
pectant group behind their chiefs. 

Both sexes of the Conducs wore 
long hair and caftans and so were 
often difficult to distinguish at a 
distance, but Shevan, high in the 
tower, thought that the delegation 
looked like a cross-section of emi- 
nent members from all four tribes. 
They represented not just the male 
negotiator and warrior -classes. She 
felt confirmed in her hope that Del 
hadnH failed her. 

Keren, hurrying down from the 
state apartments and trying to mus- 
ter his aides, was also grateful for the 
mixed appearance of the delegation. 
For him this meant the Conduc were 
not actually spoiling for a fight with 
any of their rivals. He felt less san- 
guine moments later. 



32 



IF 




Having completed the formal wel- 
come to Apian and the other chiefs, 
he settled into the conference chair 
while the Conducs squatted on the 
ground. Apian rose. The Caxitine 
leader had magnificent orange hair 
that curled at shoulder length. The 
excited whispers of his followers died 
away as he started to speak. Then, 
with uncanny timing, an unmis- 
takable sound rolled up the sky and 
scudded toward Spadrox with the 
gathering clouds. Apian stopped in 
midsentence. 

There was a moment of confusion. 
Keren jumped up. Almost reflexively 
his aides drew their neuroprobes. The 
Conducs also rustled to their feet. 
They stared toward the highway. The 
boom and snarl of Helangle steedes 
rolled down the wind. 

Apian and the other chiefs ex- 
changed glances. Keren noticed that 
they didn’t lopk startled. “Our 
brothers have come to join us,” the 
Caxitine remarked in a matter-of-fact 
tone. Only then did Keren realize 
that something of major significance 
was happening that he might be 
powerless to control or influence. 

In the tower, Shevan knew it, too, 
although she couldn’t hear what was 
being said. When the first tight bunch 
of Helangles swept into view she 
pressed both hands to her cheeks to 
stop herself from bursting into tears. 

She watched until she was sure 
that the Helangle delegation was as 



big and representative as that of the 
Conducs. They had even brought 
some of their women and children 
with them to underline the peaceful 
nature of the mission. 

Shevan went down to Karel’s vault 
and spent a long time staring at the 
sleeping leader. She wished even now 
that some miracle would happen to 
rouse him and excuse her from hav- 
ing to suffer while the next steps in 
her plan worked themselves out. 

“You dreamed your dream and it 
was true,” said the darkness. 

“They’ve come— the first ones. 
Yes, they’ve really come. Del did his 
work.” 

“There’s still a long way to go.” 

“Yes, but we’ll get to Mandanar.” 

“Mandanar,” breathed the dark- 
ness. 

The lost, secret place of the 
Superom was made so real and excit- 
ing by the old voice that Shevan 
imagined she saw its breathless 
geometries shining in the shadows of 
the vaults. 

44¥T I, KEREN Sir. Hi, my brother 
Apian.” Starhowl brought his 
bike around in the usual flamboyant 
half-circle and saluted. He dis- 
mounted and scuttled forward, ape- 
like. Apian touched the gauntleted 
hand held out to him with obvious 
distaste. 

Keren watched apprehensively.

Helangles was rare— a delegation with 
what seemed a common purpose was 
sinister. He motioned his aides to put 
up their weapons and sank warily 
into his chair to await events. 

“What’s the word from Spadrox 
pad, man?” Starhowl spoke directly 
to Apian. 

“We have not yet exchanged 
views,” said the Caxitine loftily. “We 
were just about to begin when your 
strident arrival stopped the proceed- 
ings. Perhaps we can get on now.” 
“Sure. Don’t make it heavy, man. 
I dig. Anyway I see nobody breached 
the tower yet. Shoot.” 

Keren felt a warning prickle of 
fear in his neck and fingertips as the 
Caxitine chief turned to him again. 

“Regent Keren Sir. We have come 
because you have told us that Great 
Karel is to speak at last. We are the 
nearer Conduc tribes and are known 
to you, but we have sent the news to 
every part of this continent. Soon all 
the leaders of the greater and lesser 
tribes will converge on Spadrox. All 
of us will be at peace here to see the 
awakening and hear the words from 
the past, which will restore us and 
our world to greatness. We Thetans 
will once more become part of The 
Commonwealth of Superom.” 

Apian made a dramatic sweep of 
his arm to take in both groups of 
Thetans behind him. “Already you 
see us— Conducs and Helangles in 
peace before Spadrox. We only ask 



you to tell us— when will the tower 
be breached? When will Great Karel 
speak?” 

“Where did you get this absurd 
idea?” said Keren furiously. “It’s still 
twenty days before the next Listen- 
ing Festival. Who is responsible for 
bringing you here? Who has deceived 
you into believing that the long sleep 
is ending?” 

Apian looked baffled. Behind him 
the chiefs of the Mamarian The- 
borans and the Lex Andromedans 
exchanged glances, then looked back 
suspiciously at the Superom Regent. 

“Well?” snapped Keren. His imagi- 
nation was racing. He tasted fear and 
anger in his dry mouth. 

It was left to the ugly Starhowl to 
snap the tension that bred in the 
unanswering silence. Crouching pain- 
fully a few meters to Apian’s left and 
watching both men intently from 
behind the anonymous black goggles, 
he said: “We got the message, Keren 
Sir. Like real. No errors. Checked out 
with Kickstart of the Seven Three 
City South Helanges. He got one, 
too. Those messages were made 
in Superom, with The tan translation. 
Like yawl saw always in the old 
Commonwealth. They came from 
Spadrox.” 

“Yes, Regent,” Apian confirmed. 
“My brothers and I also received 
them. There was a courier from 
Floridian of the Xanthopathiae yes- 
terday. Floridian had seen the mes- 



34 



IF 




sages posted in the Port West ap- 
proaches. His caravan is already on 
the way.” 

As if the size of the gathering 
avalanche needed confirmation, an- 
other group of Helangles cruised to- 
ward Spadrox from the south before 
the Caxitine had finished speaking. 
Keren recognized at the noisy head 
the square shoulders and broken lip 
of Kickstart, the Helangle leader 
from Seventy-Third City South. 

“I say you have been deceived,” 
said Keren. “You should all return to 
your homes. Where are these mes- 
sages? Show me one.” 

Apian turned to his group of 
followers. Two Conducs stood up 
and came forward, carrying a pouch. 
Keren saw that it was the same kind 
of case that had been used tradi- 
tionally to guard Superom messages 
and directives to the Thetans. He 
watched with the unblinking fury of 
a snake while Apian undid its fas- 
tenings. 

Starhowl had grown tired of cere- 
monies. “Heavy, man. Like hit it- 
speed it. Here—” He fished inside his 
jerkin and withdrew a sheet of metal 
foil. It had become ragged in that less 
reverent Helangle version of a pouch, 
but the little leader loped over and 
put it into Keren’s outstretched hand 
and the Regent saw that it was still 
perfectly legible. It took the form 
that Stailiowl had claimed. The 
bubbly angular perforations of com- 



puterlike script read: 

TO THE GOOD THETAN STAR- 
HOWL OF THE WEST HEL- 
ANGLES. ON THE FOURTH DAY 
OF THE MONTH OF HARVEST 
THE LISTENING AND THE 
SLEEP WILL BE OVER. GREAT 
KAREL WILL WAKE. HE WILL 
SPEAK THOSE MESSAGES OF 
DELIVERANCE THAT HAVE 
BEEN LOCKED IN HIS MIND 
FOR SIX CENTURIES. YOU ARE 
CHARGED TO SEND WORD TO 
YOUR BROTHERS IN ALL THE 
CITIES OF THIS CONTINENT TO 
ATTEND SPADROX FOR THE 
AWAKENING. 

Below, the message was repeated 
in the picture script the Superom had 
devised for their inferiors. 

The tinfoil rattled as Keren’s hand 
shook. He threw it from him. ‘'This 
is a trick—” 

Apian was waiting before him, 
holding out the Conducs’ summons. 
Keren snatched it. It was identical, 
except that the translation was in the 
Conduc numeral language. “You’ve 
been deceived.” He stood up. He 
tried to rip the foil in half, but had 
forgotten its indestructibility. 

Apian said wamingly, “Regent 
Keren Sir, that is Conduc property, if 
you please.” 

“How dare you contest Super- 
om?” Keren swung around to his 
guards. “Take him. Neuro-whip him. 
And anyone else who dares to remain 
here within the hour—” 



INHERITANCE

He stopped in midsentence. The 
aides hadn’t moved. They were look- 
ing fearfully at the silver messages on 
the ground. A few glanced over their 
shoulders with equal fear at the shut 
and silent tower. 

Starhowl said, “Yawl ought maybe 
let us pad down here until fourth 
Harvest, Keren Sir. Maybe there’s 
something going on even yawl don’t 
dig. Like maybe Great Karel didn’t 
want to say to you.” 

“Yeah,” called a voice from the 
Helangle pack. “Like maybe yawl 
don’t want Great Karel to wake, 
Regent. like yawl got it all going for 
you so long as Great Karel stays 
tripped.” 

It was the nearest thing to re- 
bellion Keren had heard of in his 
long life on Thetis. He reached for 
the neuroprobe, but his hand 
stopped, as if paralyzed. The way the 
aides were acting, if he drew they 
might draw, too-but against him, 
not with him. 

Starhowl had hopped back among 
his pack with surprising agility. He 
cuffed a youngish thug and sent him 
sprawling across the motor. As he fell 
it became apparent that he was a 
hunchbacked dwarf, the one who 
had threatened Delbet on the night 
he and Shevan were recaptured. 

“Yawl blown your mind. Arc- 
weld? Nobody talks to Superom that 
way.” 

Keren reached back to grab the 



arm of his chair. The situation was 
flying out of control. He had to 
stabilize it so that he could get back 
to where he was sure it had its 
origins. 

“I tell you that you and I are both 
victims of a plot of some kind or 
another. Those messages didn’t come 
from Spadrox.” 

“Then where did they come 
from?” It was the Lex Andromeda 
chief now. They were all getting 
bold. “There is no other surviving 
Superom enclave in Thetis.” 

“I don’t know,” Keren said barely 
above a whisper, “but believe me I 
will know. If I can’t convince you of 
your stupidity, then you’re welcome 
to convince yourselves. The fourth of 
Harvest is only three days away. Stay 
here as you please. On that day we 
will breach the vault together and 
you shall see that there is some 
mischief being worked against all of 
us. Great Karel is no more likely to 
awake on that day than during any 
of the hundreds of listening Festivals 
that have come and gone since the 
Return.” 

“As the Regent pleases,” said Ap- 
ian formally. “What do you say, my 
brother?” 

“Check,” said Starhowl. 

“Check,” repeated the faceless 
visor that hid Kickstart. 

The Caxitine chief turned to his 
three companions. They nodded 
gravely.

IF 




K eren searched the Tower 
through the screens, looking for 
his cousin. When he couldn’t find her 
he went to the Tower in person. With 
three aides he searched the place 
from top to bottom. He still couldn’t 
find her. 

He had arclamps brought into 
Karel’s vault and he searched that, 
too, being careful not to let any hint 
of what he was doing escape from 
the quadrangle of Spadrox to the 
tribal camps forming in the open 
outside the walls. 

His instinct told him that it was 
already too late to send a search 
party to the cruze mine, but he did 
so. An hour later it returned with the 
inevitable report: Delbet was not 
there. 

Now the Regent was certain about 
who had engineered the conspiracy. 
What made his flesh creep was won- 
dering how they proposed to carry it 
through. 

Twice he returned alone to the 
Tower. He went to the vault and 
stood before the casket for minutes 
on end to make sure that Karel still 
slept, that he showed no sign of 
returning from that tideless sea of 
green dreams. Both times Keren was 
reassured. So what trick had Shevan 
and Delbet invented to show to the 
assembled Thetans? 

Shevan hid in the darkness made 
of the smells of earth and leaves 
while her cousin skirted the edge of 



madness. Shade had led her far back 
into the tunnel that ran between the 
vault and a hillside outside Spadrox. 
The formless spirit of the Tower 
didn’t leave her lonely in the dark. 
She knew he was there, even though 
he didn’t speak. Sometimes extrava- 
gant visions of Mandanar came into 
her head. She knew then that she was 
intuiting Shade’s fading memories 
and escaping dreams. 

When Keren had finally retreated 
from the Tower, baffled, she went 
back one afternoon. Cautiously, in 
case a screen might suddenly become 
bright and burning with her cousin’s 
eyes, she climbed to the fourth flight 
and saw that the gathering she had 
engineered had grown steadily. 

Floridian, the Xanthopath, had 
arrived with a small caravan of five 
vehicles and fifteen followers, in- 
cluding some notable sailors. The 
Xanthopathiae lived on the shores of 
one of Thetis’ big inland seas and had 
adapted some of their vehicles to an 
amphibian role for their fishing in- 
dustry. 

There had already been a number 
of fights between rival groups in the 
Helangle camp. The camp, as deliber- 
ately ugly and uncouth as the Hel- 
angles themselves, sprawled away 
north and east. The different scout 
parties kept to themselves in the 
main. Nearly all had brought their 
tattered, low-slung tents but only 
one or two groups had really turned 



INHERITANCE 



37 




the mission into a pilgrimage and 
brought full entourages. 

It was these sybarites who caused 
the isolated fights, taunting the in- 
voluntary celibacy of their com- 
panions by flaunting their women 
and their grotesque lovemaking after 
the midday meal was over and the 
traditional love period started. 

Fortunately for peace and order, a 
weak Thetan rain had come to send 
the lovers scurrying into their tents 
and out of sight on this particular 
afternoon. Starhowl, Kickstart and 
some of the others had been given a 
chance to organize vigilante teams 
mounted on stecdes and the camp 
was calm again. 

The Conducs under ^lan and the 
other paramount chiefs still favored 
discretion rather than trust. They 
had already formed their somber 
vehicles into protective configura- 
tions with the doors locked. Conduc 
women had been known to vanish 
before in the night with a sigh and a 
jubilant thrust of pistons. 

Between Apian’s group and Flo- 
ridian’s a delegation from one of the 
lesser Thetan tribes had arrived and 
camped. These were the Agorans 
who still cultivated some stretches of 
the old foodland of the Common- 
wealth and, when they were not 
raided by Helangles or browbeaten 
by the Conducs, sold what they grew 
to make a living. 

They arrived on cadelback. The 



cadel was a Thetan beast of burden 
looking something of a cross between 
a giant wingless bird and a ruminant. 
They had corralled their animals and 
raised the Agoran trading standard: 
halved arms with a symbolic pack of 
instant food and three lozenges of 
fire-ore gules. In spite of this invita- 
tion, when a bunch of Helangles 
went over to trade the Agorans 
stuffily told them that they had only 
brou^t enough food for themselves. 
An intertribal incident was avoided 
by the quick intervention of a Hel- 
angle vigilante^ posse under the com- 
numd of the aggressive Arcweld. 

A little before sundown another 
small tribd delegation came slowly 
from ^e northeast. The rain had 
stopped and the various enc^p- 
ments were sprinkled with the light 
of fire-ore lamps and stoves, the 
smell of cooking and the movement 
of restless and expectant people. 

Straining to see through the dusk, 
hungry Shevan in her tower watched 
the new arrivals and her heart 
thumped once enormously. 

The newcomers were a group of 
Saivainte. Saivainte were nearing ex- 
tinction as a separate Thetan group. 
Under the Commonwealth they had 
been the distinguished social class of 
Thetan humanity, ranking next in 
intellectual development to the 
Superom and employed by them as 
teachers and instructors to the lesser 
Thetans. 



38 



IF 




During the decline they had 
quickly dwindled in numbers, ab- 
sorbed under force or necessity by 
more aggressive groups in the battle 
for survival. On the continent where 
Spadrox stood only one colony of 
them remained. 

They lived like a religious com- 
munity in the mountains to the 
northeast. They scra^hed a living 
from the barren rocks by keeping 
kiltawi, the Thetan sheep, and taking 
in the sons of Conduc chiefs or the 
Agoran traders to give them some 
rudiments of the old Superom train- 
ing. 

But it wasn’t the sight of these 
barefoot scholars in their patched 
and shabby copies of the former 
Saivainte cloak, tunic and pants that 
filled Shevan’s heart. Towering in the 
center of the party, disguised as a 
Saivainte but easily recognizable even 
in the gloom, was Delbet. 

Shevan found her lips trembling 
and a chill sweat prickling her back 
and the palms of her hands. Damn it, 
it was too soon for him to have 
come! With three clear days to the 
fourth of Harvest, Keren would un- 
doubtedly try to get at him before 
the opening of the Tower. 

Shevan couldn’t allow anything to 
happen to Delbet. Everything, every- 
thing that was to happen now de- 
pended on him. 

She had felt increasingly over the 
last weeks that she had ceased to be a 



child and was at last completely a 
woman. But the emotion she felt as 
Delbet reappeared that evening 
among the Saivainte was still partly 
made up of a child’s inational rage 
and a mother’s scolding concern. 

Why didn*t you stay away, Del? 
Her breath condensed against the 
window as though anger were a 
tangible thing. Stupid child-you 
never remember anything I tell you. 
Can you remember what you *ve got 
to do? Del, my dear, Keren *s watch- 
ing you now. Just as Fm watching 
you. Those family eyes! One of us 
staring hate-one seeing love. I have 
to find some way to protect you-as 
always. Why did you come back 
now, Del? Why the hell did you 
come back tonight? 

IV 

A ll the orbiters the Superom had 
^ set in the Thetan sky for night 
illumination had long since burned 
out. 

In the xiarkness high above the 
thin rain that had started to fall once 
more, they still .wove patterns 
through the planet’s gravity. They 
were anonymous, cold— as lost as the 
power of their creators. 

The Thetan encampments outside 
the walls of Spadrox were quiet. 
Fire-ore lamps glowed here and 
there. A patrol of skeptical Conducs 
moved around their wagon circle. 



INHERITANCE 



39 




looking over their shoulders at the 
He 1 angle camp. The Agorans, 
wrapped in huge plastic bags against 
the damp, mored in chorus below 
their standard. The Helangles, their 
bloated love appetites satisfled for 
the night, grunted as they nuzzled 
their plump, ugly women in sleep. 

On a northeast hillside .above 
Spadrox a flicker of blue movement 
might have been the rising of a talue, 
but it was too insignificant for any- 
one in the camps to pay attention to 
it. 

Shevan let the thorn bushes fall 
back over the cave mouth. She 
crouched quietly for several mo- 
ments to be sure she hadn’t been 
seen. She turned her face up to the 
rain and then again to stare slowly 
over at the Tower. The thought went 
through her head that the tunnel she 
had just crawled through must be 
nearly five hundred meters long. 

Down there outside the walls, 
somewhere in the straggling arc of 
encampments, were the Saivainte and 
Del among them. Del had come 
disguised and Shevan had gotten 
Shade to find her a Conduc caftan to 
make -her less conspicuous on her 
expedition. He had left it at the 
tunnel’s end for her. 

She started going down the hill 
through bush and trees, stopping 
frequently to make sure that the 
quadrangle of Spadrox remained 
quiet. 



T he SidVaiiitc had no tents or 
protection from the rain. 
Wrapped in a cloak barely big enough 
to si^ld him to his waist, Del 
dreamed. He dreamed of gleaming 
cylinders pistoning back and forth, 
up and down. Their simple power 
drew parallelograms, welded ellipses, 
transmuted geometric shapes into 
shifting, patternless forms forever 
changing, but always gathering and 
dispensing energy within their vary- 
ing perimeters. 

He muttered and twitched while 
silver wheels whirred and cogs, ma- 
chined to finite degrees of accuracy, 
spun light into a ravenous cone, 
revolving, bright. In his brain the 
finger terminals fluttered among 
banks of selectors and preselectors 
on a dream console fifty meters long 
and as high as a wish. Great gyres of 
wisdom drilled from the cone into 
his sleep. Through them threaded a 
broken message tensed into a ring. 

He didn’t want to come awake. He 
shook and muttered angrily at a 
sleepwalking hand annoying his 
shoulder. He struggled to hold the 
warm parts of the cube root of 
dreams together, but the persistent 
hand had acquired a voice. It poured 
consciousness into his ear and the 
voice knew a name and the name 
spun down the whorls of his hearing 
like quicksilver. 

“Del. Wake up, Del. Del, dear-” 
He awoke. The transition from 



40 



IF 




dream to world was immediate. Out 
of the bowl of night hanging over 
him the rain came quietly down like 
thought or his lost sleep, washing 
away the tantalizing, broken mes- 
sage. 

The Saivainte sprawled around, 
wrapped in their cloaks. With an 
immense start Del recognized a 
damp, warm presence at his side. 

“Hell, Shev— it’s you. Great Karel, 
you could have started—” 

“Shush, Del. lie down. I’ll stay on 
this side of you. Put the cloak over 
me. 

“I’m sure glad to see you, Shev. 
But what the hell? I thought we 
wouldn’t do anything together till-” 
“Will you lie down?” The girl 
raged softly, digging cruel little 
talons into his arm. 

He obeyed, grinning ruefully at 
her single-mindedness, exposing him- 
self to the rain, wrapping her in the 
Saivainte cloak that swallowed her 
almost completely, turning on his 
side so that his bulk would hide her 
from his companions if they woke. 

Shevan’s wide-eyed face stared at 
him from the folds of the cloak. 

“Why did you come back so early, 
Del? You’re crazy.” 

“Why, now, aren’t you being just 
plain cussed, Shev? I have to be here 
to do what you told me—” 

“Shush. Whisper, you dummy. 
Three whole days must go by before 
they can breach the vault. You ought 



to have stayed in the mountains.” 
“But they said we ought to leave 
right away. Zedward- that’s the head 
man— he said we better leave to make 
sure of getting to Spadrox in good 
time. We just made it fast.” 

“Yes, but that gives Keren three 
days to get to you. Even if he doesn’t 
know what we’re going to do he 
suspects something. He’s already 
guessed you made the messages. It’s 
lucky you arrived just at nightfall. 
That Saivainte disguise won’t fool 
anyone in daylight. You look like a 
dressed-up tree. You’ve got to get 
out of the camp and stay out until 
the fourth.” 

The giant gulped. His expression 
was so remorseful that Shevan had to 
bite her lip to stop herself from 
smiling in spite of her worry. 
“Where?” he whispered. 

“I’ve already thought it out. It’s 
dangerous, but you’ll have to come 
back and hide out in Shade’s tunnel. 
Keren doesn’t know about it. It’s the 
only place.” 

Del pursed his lips and shook his 
head slowly, baffled by Shevan’s 
complex logic. “Well, I guess I always 
do what you say, Shev. Do you think 
I ought to wake Zedward and tell 
him where I’m—” 

He saw the look in Shevan’s eyes 
and stopped. He shrugged. 

“Come on, dummy,” she said. 
“Keep me in sight, but stay well 
behind me, so if anything happens 



INHERITANCE 



41 




at least one of us can get away.’’ 

She threw off the cloak and 
started to make her way back 
through the camps. The Conduc caf- 
tan Shade had chosen for her was a 
dark one and helped to make her less 
obvious in the night. She kept as 
close to the Conduc sectors as she 
could. Here, if anyone did see her, 
she was least likely to arouse sus- 
picion. 

Del waited for a moment, then 
followed. It was easy to pick out 
Shevan-she was the only movement 
at the line of Conduc vehicles. 

He flitted .after her with the quiet 
speed he had learned hunting talues. 
Why did the sudden thought of the 
beautiful little Thetan rodents 
trouble him? Why should the recol- 
lection of pleasure be linked with 
uneasy dread? 

Shevan was already out of the 
camp area. Her slight figure darted 
away from Spadrox at a tangent 
aimed at the hillside. The caftan was 
too long for her and reached well 
below her knees. The giant grinned. 
It made her look like a baby again in 
a long nightgown. The last Superom 
child on Thetis. 

Del discovered presently he had 
been moving too quickly. The gap 
between him and Shevan had nearly 
closed. He kneeled in the shadow of 
the last vehicle in the Conduc circle, 
letting Shevan put distance between 
them. He was glad of the blanketed 



sky. The rain came down weight- 
lessly like smoke or mist. 

He started after Shevan again. She 
was nearly out of sight. 

From one of the tents in the big 
Helangle camp came an unexpected 
whinny of pleasure followed by a 
ragged chorus of grumbling shouts 
and oaths. Ihe Conducs stirred un- 
easily behind him in their battered 
wagons. Del ran out into the night 
and the mist. 

S HEVAN hadn’t realized the hill 
was so steep. The caftan was 
becoming heavy in the persistent 
rain. She stopped, panting, pressing 
her right hand to a stitch that jabbed 
at the place where her ribs ended. 

A little farther uphill she could see 
a deeper blackness that had to be the 
scrub patch that concealed the tun- 
nel. The rain seemed to be thicken- 
ing. Looking behind her, she could 
see the Thetan camps only as a blur. 
Something moved downhill to her 
right— that would be Del tracking 
her. 

She took a deep breath. If she 
didn’t go on he would catch up and 
she couldn’t risk their being together 
in case Keren had put out patrols. 

ae gathered the caftan and set off 
for the trees, sucking gasps of air 
through her open mouth. 

She got to them-stunted Thetan 
beores and the soft-needled hoeth. 
She was a few paces inside the tangle 



42 



IF 




of dripping branches when something 
sprang at her with a grunt. 

It struck her just below the right 
hip with such force that she went 
headlong into the hoeth needles and 
leaves. The breath was knocked out 
of her. limbs locked themselves 
around hers pinning her down. Only 
the tiniest chopped scream got out 
from under a hand that thudded over 
her mouth. 

She tried to fight but the creature 
was immensely powerful. Staring up 
in terror, she recognized the feature- 
less goggles and hard, black crash hat 
of a Ifelangle. 

He was like some ruthless preda^ 
tory insect. She bit the hand covering 
her mouth. It didn’t flinch. The free 
hand ripped the wet caftan in one 
movement, top to bottom, and' then 
tore greedily at the coveralls under- 
neath. 

The caftan had helped to conceal 
her Superom identity in the night. At 
the same time it made her like a 
Conduc female, tempting quarry to a 
prowling Helangle. 

The coveralls ripped. Shevan felt 
the rain on her body. The wasphead 
came down with a mouth that bit 
and sucked. She managed between 
real pain and fright, to scream at last. 

Then it was over. The ravening 
thing was struck cleanly sideways 
and off her with a single blow. It was 
so violently and expertly delivered 
that the Helangle made no sound at 



all. Nothing moved for a moment. 
The attack on her had lasted fifteen 
seconds, perhaps twenty. 

Shevan flung herself against DeVs 
chest, sobbing, clawing at him as 
though she were now herself trying 
to act out in reverse the role she had 
just escaped. The giant held her 
gently and stroked her wet hair. 

“It’s okay, Siev. I got him. He’s 
out. He’s not ^ing to hurt you now. 
Hell, Shev, hush up. You’re gonna 
have die \^ole camp roused and 
Keren and Spadrox, top. Will you 
hush now, baby? You’re okay.” 

He crooned and rocked her till she 
was cahner, racked only now and 
then with an anmense sob. 

He went over and looked at the 
lan]^ bundle lying against the trunk 
of a beor about three meters away. 
After staring at the unconscious Hel- 
angle, he studied the sore edge of his 
own hand. “He’s sure going to wake 
with a bad lump, that one.” 

“Del, come on. Let’s go. Let’s get 
out of this.” A tiny note of hysteria 
struggled in her voice. 

He picked her up. She tried to 
hold her torn clothes together. Del’s 
body felt strong, clean and warm. 
Her deshabille didn’t seem to matter 
now. They were together. She 
needed his protection as much from 
the memory of the attack as the fear 
of something like it happening again. 
But they got to the tunnel unham- 
pered.

The giant put her down. They 
crawled in. Five meters into the smell 
of earth and leaves that composed 
the dark, Shev stopped. 

At that point they were still near 
enough to the entrance to see a dim 
glow funneling back from the night 
outride. She sat down, leaned against 
the tunnel wall and pushed both 
hands up and over her face and into 
her hair. 

She said something. Del didn’t 
hear what it was. He put out his hand 
to stroke her hair again. She was 
looking down at the tom caftan and 
ripped coveralls beneath it, holding 
the torn parts open, staring quietly at 
her body. 

Her clear white skin had an almost 
luminous glow in the cave. Del saw 
that truly she wasn’t a little girl any 
more, 

‘ “You’re wet, Shev,” he said. 

“Del. Warm me.” Her voice had an 
unfamiliar thickness. 

“Sure. Hold on, Shev. Here-my 
tunic’s more or less dry and it’s warm 
from me. There, I’ll take it off. You 
get out of of that wet, old torn 
stuff.” 

He held up the tunic and helped 
her find the neck of it. She slid into 
it. It was so big it would have held 
twin Shevans. 

“There now.” 

Suddenly she had snuggled against 
him, shivering. “Del— you— ” She 
kissed him. Her parted lips opened 



wider under his. The kiss was so 
unexpected he almost recoiled. She 
hadn’t kissed him like that since the 
big, awkward, wet baby kisses she 
had ^ven him when she had been 
small enough for him to swing, 
squealing and pleading,^ up into the 
sky in the palm of one hand. 

“You lie quiet now, Shev. Why, 
you’re so hot it feels like you’ve got 
a fever.” 

“No—” The awkward kiss sought 
him again and she bit his lip. Her 
hands explored his chest and back. 
He held them because they tickled 
and he didn’t want to laugh. 

“What’s happened to you, Shewy? 
You sick? You really sick,^baby? 
You’re burning.” 

As suddenly as it had started, the 
attack passed. Shevan wrenched 
away from him and flung herself 
onto her side in the old leaves and 
bracken on the tunnel floor. 

“Why, hell— now what’s wrong, 
Shev? We’re safe in here, baby. 
What’s the matter?’ 

Shevan had started to cry again. 
Although she had turned her back on 
him he could recognize the sound of 
her crying. 

“Leave me alone. I’m all right!” 

He kneeled beside her, patting her 
shoulder comfortingly. 

“Don’t touch me!” She spoke so 
violently that he jumped. “Don’t 
touch me, you big dummy! Leave me 
be!”

IF 




He backed farther into the tunnel. 
You could never account for girls. 
Even this Superom girl wasn’t ra- 
tional. He listened. Yes, he could still 
hear Shevan’s quiet tears in the dark- 
ness. 

But it would be alhright now. Ever 
since she had been a baby, once the 
shouting tantrums were over and the 
anger started washing out of her eyes 
in water, it was okay. After that she 
would sleep, Del turned to lie on his 
side and was soon breathing deeply. 
The glowing inventions and mechani- 
cal wonders of his dreams returned. 

¥ T WAS a little before sunrise on 

the fourth of Harvest. The Regent 
sat in his audience room. He had 
dressed in his ceremonial uniform the 
previous evening, knowing that he 
wouldn’t sleep that night. Blue sha- 
dows of fatigue had appeared under 
his eyes in the last three days. He sat 
up hour after hour, switching from 
scanner to scanner in the Tower 
complex, hoping to detect some 
movement. There was nothing. 

Outside, the delegations continued 
to gather. If he went to the window 
and looked he knew he would see the 
camps of many tribes fanning out 
into the distance. And these would 
still be only the nearer tribes. There 
had not yet been time for the news 
to have reached the more remote 
Thetan continents. 

The gathering had not been with- 



out its problems. Food, water and 
sanitation had been foremost. 
Keren’s nose wrinkled. Then there 
was the old enmity between the two 
main groups: the Conducs and Hel- 
angles. It had flared into a series of 
bruising encounters after one randy 
young scout had made an attempt on 
a Conduc girl and had been found 
next morning on the hillside with a 
fractured collarbone and a lump big 
as an egg on the side of his jaw. 

Although he had called, a quick 
peace conference to avoid bloodshed, 
Keren had seen an opportunity to 
dissolve the gathering and escape the 
trap he sensed his cousin was setting 
for him. He tried to persuade some 
of his aides to go out and make 
trouble between the camps. But al- 
though his men had relented in their 
initial rebellion against him, they 
wouldn’t go but among the Thetans. 
They feared the bright silver mes- 
sages, which the tribal chiefs had 
nailed to wands set up at the en- 
trances to their camps. They also 
feared and respected the sleeping old 
man in the Tower more than they 
respected their master. Perhaps Karel 
was going to speak at last and had 
managed to send out his own invita- 
tions. 

So Keren was left without any 
chance of controlling the situation. 
Nor could he effectively search the 
camps to find out whether that 
remorseless girl child and her simple- 



INHERITANCE 



45 




minded giant playmate were con- 
cealed somewhere out there. Even his 
own three sons could not be relied 
on not to take fright, half Thetan as 
they were. 

One of the aides had told him that 
on the first night of the gathering an 
incongruously tall Saivainte had ar- 
rived with the delegation from the 
mountains just at dusk, but had not 
been seen since. The Lex Andro- 
medan Conduc chief had complained 
of the theft of a blue caftan from 
one of his senior women. Although 
the Helangles were probably to 
blame, this incident and others and 
some queer rumors that had reached 
him had left Keren convinced that 
She van and Delbet were close by and 
that on this dawn they would come 
out of hiding. 

He stood up and watched the light 
run slowly like water into sand along 
the cloud base at the mountain tops. 

Suppose Karel were really going to 
speak. No, the idea was outrageous. 
The attempts of Shevan to escape 
Spadrox, her imprisonment in the 
Tower, her disappearance and Del’s 
were all linked to the mysterious 
arrival of the messages. It had to be a 
plot. 

The Thetans were beginning to stir 
excitedly, although the encampments 
were still dark. Only the mountain- 
tops and the highest crags of the 
distant stone jungles held the Thetan 
dawn light. 



Keren squeezed the bridge of his 
nose, pressing the tip of finger and 
thumb against his weary eyes. It was 
time to go and call his wives and 
children. The most important Listen- 
ing Festival since the Return was 
about to begin. 

^T^HE two great processional doors 
^ were flung open. A metal shutter 
ran up, clearing the east window, and 
immediately the vault was flooded 
with light. The green aura of Karel’s 
casket drowned in it and the lifted 
shadows seemed to reveal movement 
in his sleeping face. 

The Regent, followed first by his 
sons and daughters and then by his 
wives, entered the vault. The para- 
mount Thetan chiefs came next, 
crowding and jostling for position. 
The Helangles were especially ill- 
tempered because their withered legs 
and their crouch put them at a 
disadvantage in a crowd. 

As the procession came forward 
untidily into the familiar brilliance 
two people moved away from the 
right-hand wall. They were pale and 
disheveled. The girl’s uniform had 
been torn and crudely sewn together 
at the rents. The man looked down 
nervously at Karel’s casket. He licked 
his lips. Small beads of sweat stood 
out on his forehead. 

Keren stopped so short that two 
of his sons cannoned into him. He 
had expected some dramatic reap- 



46 



IF 




pearance of his rival and her friend, 
but not quite this soon. The two 
looked like starved and vengeful 
ghosts as they confronted him. 

“Well, cousin,” said Keren at last. 
“You’ve certainly been up to your 
tricks. You’ve kept yourself and your 
outsize playmate well out of sight, 
haven’t you?” He spoke in the high 
Superom, the words as arid as his 
tongue and lips felt. 

The two young people were re- 
turning the salutes of the Thetans. 
Even Keren’s children reluctantly 
raised their hands to their foreheads 
in the customary flat-palmed recog- 
nition of superiors. 

“Get on with your business, 
cousin,” mocked Shevan. “Thetis is 
waiting for the Awakening.” 

“I warn you, Shevan,” Keren 
snarled, “if you’ve concocted some 
trick-” 

“Come, cousin, this is a day when 
we last Superom— even the ^ half- 
bred— should avoid quarrels. Our lost 
leader is about to return.” 

Keren scowled, but said nothing 
more. The The tan chiefs, his family 
and even some of the lesser Thetans 
were now pressing forward into the 
chamber. They fanned out around its 
sides to surround the casket at the 
center. Hundreds of eyes focused on 
the still form buried in six hundred 
years of dreams. No one spoke. 

Shevan and Del had taken their 
places at the head of the casket. 



several paces behind it, facing Keren. 

Now all the eyes in the vault turned 
to a copper shield on the west wall. 
Keren turned to face it. The casket 
was behind him. His hollow eyes 
stared at the shield as though willing 
it to refuse to collect the first rays of 
the climbing sun in the unshuttered 
east window. 

But now the shield caught fire. It 
was as though the metal ignited and 
burned. The light consumed the rim, 
then spun down into a cunningly 
turned concavity. 

As it touched the center Keren 
turned. He was like a man sleep- 
walking— or a puppet. Facing the 
casket, he paused. His mouth 
opened. Then he gathered himself 
and spoke the familiar ritual words, 
first in high Superom, then in the 
Thetan lingua franca. * 

“The Waiting is over. The Listen- 
ing has come. Great Karel, awake and 
speak to your lost brothers.” 

Like a terribly thin, fatally ex- 
panded, intensely brittle sphere of 
glass the vault crackled with breath- 
holding silence. 

Sheven’s face was deathly pale. 
She swayed, waiting. She dared not 
look at the giant by her side. 

Del was equally pale. His big hands 
clenched and unclenched. Sweat 
trickled slowly down his left temple. 

Keren’s eyes found his cousin’s 
and bored into them. They must 
have been the only two people in the 



INHERITANCE 



47 




vault not watching Karel’s casket. 

Then it came, a frail but purpose- 
ful voice. The crystal of silence 
cracked as all the Thetans in the 
vault fell to their knees^ 

“Yes, the time has come. The time 
for my awakening has come.” 

The voice came unmistakably 
from the casket. Karel’s lips appeared 
not to have moved— but did anyone 
dare to be sure? Only the fierce 
disbelief of Keren and the hypnotic 
concentration of Shevan were once 
more rooted to the face in the 
casket. 

“I must be taken to Mandanar. My 
casket can be opened there, where 
the secrets that will restore me are 
still preserved. Let my brothers—” 
the voice faltered, then recovered. 
“Let my brother Delbet and my 
sister Shevan go with me. Let my 
brother Keren remain at Spadrox as 
hostage to my Thetan brothers 
against my return-” The voice fal- 
tered again, grew still. 

Delbet, the giant, was swaying. He 
raised a hand feebly, but it didn’t 
reach his head before he toppled. 
Shevan, who had seen him sway, 
stopped forward to hold him but his 
huge, unconscious weight brought 
her down as well. They lay at the 
head of the casket. 

No one moved. The silence was 
bursting again. Karel’s voice had 
stopped. 

Suddenly Keren screamed: “False! 



Don’t be deceived! It’s a trick! They 
invented it. Those two there. They’re 
in league with the old spirit of the 
Tower. It was his voice you heard! 
Take them, guards! Agate— Hadra— 
Spero— draw your probes. It’s a plot 
to destroy me and Spadrox. They 
want to carry off Great Karel. It 
wasn’t his voice you heard, I tell you. 
It was the voice of Shade.” 

“How can that be. Regent?” From 
among the trembling Thetans a pale 
transparent shadow emerged. He was 
incredibly old. The bright light of the 
vault almost shone through him-he 
cast only the flicker of a shadow on 
the floor of the vault. “How can that 
be when I am here and the casket lies 
there?”- 

Keren backed away from it. It 
came slowly toward him. 

At the head of the casket Shevan 
knelt by Del. The giant was stirring. 
The girl whispered urgently, almost 
angrily into his ear. 

Del raised his "head. He stared 
glassily at the tableau of casket, 
Keren, the strange old form of air 
and shadows, the cringing Thetans. 
Ife seemed to make a huge effort to 
stay conscious. 

Then the sleeping leader spoke 
again. His voice was fainter, but still 
resolute. 

“Take me to Mandanar. I must be 
taken to Mandanar.” 

“We hear' you, my leader,” 
breathed Shade. “To Mandanar!” 



48 



IF 




“To Mandanar! To Mandanar!” 
The Thetans in the vault took up the 
cry. It spread like a fire back down 
the processional passageway out into 
the quadrangle ancf to the campus. 
“To Mandanar! Thetis will be great 
again!” 

Only one Thetan was slow to 
move from the vault. The pande- 
monium hadn’t seized him. His blaz- 
ing eyes still stared with hatred at the 
giant Delbet in Shevan’s arms. 

Keren saw it. 

His aides and even his own wives 
and children caught the crowd’s 
hysteria. They streamed away from 
the chamber with the rest, leaving 
him defeated, deserted, his mind 
numb. 

But Keren saw the strange look on 
the Helangle’s bruised face. His imag- 
ination began to race. As the dwarf 
turned and loped after the other 
Thetans the Regent read the starry 
name studded across the jacket. He 
held it like a hot iron against his 
memory. His numbed thoughts began 
to stir and weave again. 



Book 2 , Arcweld 

V 

ALL the maps of Thetis were lost, 
but the Helangles carried maps 
in their memories. By the fifth day 
out of Spadrox they had led the 



great convoy to the hills above West- 
ward City Three. 

It was dark. Arcweld lay alone on 
the hillside by his steede. Overhead 
the huge red and orange stars of the 
Thetan night burned like fire-ore in 
the burrows of the talue^ The dwarfs 
thoughts burned with them as he lay 
alone. 

He drank the night. He drank it 
and the stars thirstily, tormented by 
memories of two other nights. He 
was staying womanless by choice on 
the expedition. Starhowl, Kickstart, 
Smoke trail all lay warm, shaggy and 
satisfied with their snoring, snuggling 
women. But Arcweld tossed, drink- 
ing the stars, his thoughts feeding 
like acid on the steely memory of a 
night without stars. 

The bruise on his jaw had gone, 
but he had absorbed the humiliation 
of it into his twisted body. After a 
day’s slow riding to keep pace with 
the convoy his shoulder hurt. Wine* 
ing, he turned to his other side, 
staring down through the helmet’s 
black visor toward the center of the 
camp. 

Hie giant was scared. He was 
scared, all right. He’d been scared in 
the vault. He had fainted when G.K. 
spoke. And the fear in his face hadn’t 
lessened as the distance between the 
convoy and Spadrox increased. 

Arcweld chewed his lip. That 
other night— it hadn’t been like this 
one. There had been rain, thin as 



INHERITANCE

mist or a smoke trail. He had lain on 
that hillside above Spadrox, a slope 
like this one but treed and bushed 
with beores and hoeth to hide him. 

She had come from the Conduc 
camp, moving up the hillside in a 
dark caftan, stealthy but purposeful. 
He had watched her, seeing only a 
young Conduc girl with strangely 
short hair. She had been crazy to be 
unescorted. He had watched her— 
hadn’t understood why she should be 
out alone. He had understood later- 
after he had struck. 

Snarling silently, Arcweld drew up 
his withered legs at the memory. 
Squirming. She hadn’t been a Con- 
duc at all. He remembered himself 
ripping, tearing— finding smooth skin 
under his lips. Superom skin. Not 
cold and furred like Thetan Con- 
duc— not hairy like Helangle woman. 
A deep sacrilege-yet why not? Hel- 
angle, Superom. A new Thetan para- 
mount blood. And then. Rigid, ma- 
levolent, Arcweld sat up, feeling in 
his mind the bolt strike him, the 
darkness come down again. 

What doing out in the mist, the 
smoke? What doing on that hillside? 
Her and the giant. Disguised as a 
Conduc . 

The giant Arcweld hadn’t seen. 
Only the thunderblow striking him 
sideways. Then the dark. 

Arcweld nightmared. He swal- 
lowed the stars of a different night. 

The two men . had come for him 



quietly, as if they had known he 
would be lying awake by his sleeping 
steede. He had seen them approach- 
ing across the encampment, distorted 
in the fitful flares of occasional 
campfires. Then the two of them 
had been standing over him, hissing 
their pidgin attempt at the Helangle 
tongue. 

“Yawl come with us. Creep. Soft, 
man.” 

He had recognized them. Despised 
them. Keren’s slaves. As though any- 
thing would wake the snorting, seed- 
blown scouts and their sticky, hairy 
women wrapped under tents. 

They had smuggled him into Spad- 
rox by a side way. Along corridors, 
past shut doors, panting as he 
scuttled along, keeping up with their 
haste. They had pushed him through 
a door and left him. 

Arcweld stirred. His strong teeth 
closed on the darkness of the dream. 
His arms twitched in sleep as in the 
audience room at Spadrox he had 
raised them to salute the staring 
hollows of Keren’s eyes in the gloom. 

“Your name is Arcweld?” 

A nod. 

“You will accompany the expedi- 
tion to Mandanar?” It wasn’t really a 
question. Just a flat statement. 

Another nod. The dwarf didn’t 
want to speak. If he talked to the 
Regent he must use the “sir” suffix. 
He saw no need for this humility 
now. Keren needed him, Arcweld, a 



50 



IF 




The tan. He believed now that the 
days of the Suprom were numbered. 
He read doom in the mad eyes. Only 
the neuroprobe bolstered on the 
Regent’s hip wielded power. The 
dwarf respected that. Besides, he 
needed the hate and cunning of this 
man who was the giant’s enemy, too. 
He needed it. For the moment. 

The dwarfs mouth below the visor 
snapped at stars as he slept on the 
hillside above Westward City Three. 
The bearded face spun toward him in 
the unlit audience room. In enor- 
mous closeup he^saw the lips, framed 
in black hair, the white teeth, bril- 
liant gums, the tongue alive behind 
them like a seabeast in its cave. 

“Why do you hate the giant?’ 
Arcweld snarled. He tried to hold 
down the animal reaction, but there 
were no words in his throat. Hate 
was inarticulate. 

“Did he do that to you?” 

The Regent’s cruel fingers poked 
his bruised jaw. Arcweld howled, 
cringing backward, his eyes hostile. 

“And this?” Keren reached for the 
hurt shoulder, but the Helangle 
backed away, growling. 

“Heavy. I’ll lay him down, too. 
Like real. I’ll fix.” 

“Why? What did he do to you? 
Why did he-” 

“Nix.” 

“What did you see? What were 
you doing?’ 

The Regent’s urgency made Arc- 



weld bold. He leaned forward on his 
knuckles. He stared insolently into 
Keren’s face. 

“Nix. What we have is between 
Delbet Sir and Arcweld. Keren Sir 
wants use Arcweld, is on Arcweld’s 
say.” 

Keren watched him closely. “Do 
you know what I want? I want them 
broken. I want Delbet Sir and the 
Karel myth broken. I want back 
what they’ve taken from me. I want 
it back. And the girl. I want her 
back. I want her here at Spadrox. Do 
you understand?” 

Arcweld nodded briefly. His ugly 
Helangle face twitched into the imi- 
tation of a smile. It remained fixed. 
The rictus on the face of a corpse. It 
was novel to have a Superom who 
required favors of a Thetan. 

“And for me?” he breathed. 
“What for Arcweld, man?” 

“Listen,” said Keren. Faintly, 
from somewhere in the night outside 
Spadrox, came lonely cries. 

“And how, too?” The dwarf in- 
sisted. “How?’ 

“Listen.” 

“Listen. Listen.” Arcweld 
mumbled the words into the dark 
ground as he awoke, “listen.” The 
dream had been so real that he sat up 
anxiously. He crouched, staring back 
into it, listening again to the lonely 
cries that seemed to have reached 
tentacles into this dawn. He found 
himself still searching for the bearded 



INHERITANCE 



SI 




face in the audience room at Spad- 
rox— which had become daybreak on 
a hillside several hundred kilometers 
away. Listen! He crouched, listening. 

T he cries were becoming fainter. 

The dwarf shook his head to 
clear it. The sounds appeared to 
come from an area of woodland to 
his right. 

Arcweld scratched himself nerv- 
ously. He turned the scarab-head 
helmet from side to side to locate the 
exact direction of the sound. 
Scratching uneasily, he muttered 
under his breath. The cries were 
anxious. Their link with his recent 
dream disturbed him. 

The camp was still held in a bowl 
of shadow. The approaching light 
hadn’t yet spilled into it over the 
sides. Nothing stirred down there. 

Arcweld fondled the machine be- 
side him. He found comfort in its 
sleeping power. His fingers sought 
the outline of something locked in 
one of the hide panniers behind the 
saddle. He stroked it. It gave him 
confidence to go find the mystery of 
the cries. The juxtaposition of dream 
cries and cries here in the dawn urged 
him on. If he didn’t go now they 
would be lost at any moment. 

He looked around once more, then 
loped uphill, making for the scrub 
line where he would be less easily 
seen. 

He had only gone a few hundred 



meters through the bush when one of 
the cries sprang up close to him. It 
startled him, but he recognized it 
now. It was a talue. There was 
another, still far off, but getting 
closer. Something was driving a pack 
of the little silver-blue creatures to- 
ward him. It was unusual for them to 
leave their burrows except between 
dusk and full nightfall to look for 
food. They were being hunted. Their 
forlorn cries were all around him 
now. 

The dwarf darted into thicker 
cover. Dawn light was reaching here. 
He lay flat. Almost immediately 
something leaped across him. He 
snarled, cuffing at it like a cat. But it 
fled. It had only been intent on 
avoiding him anyway. Silver-blue, 
waterfall-colored, it streaked into the 
bushes. 

Two more passed in front of him 
an arm’s length from where he lay. 
Then came a cry that made him 
twitch back convulsively. 

It seemed to come from the very 
thicket in which he was hiding. It 
might have come from the tangle of 
thorns, trailers and uncurling leaves 
before his face. 

Teeth bared, he slithered back- 
ward. And it came again. It was 
different from the hunted cry— a 
female’s call.* What sent fear and 
flight spilling into his blood was the 
fact that he saw nothing in the bush 
where it had originated. 



52 



IF 




The dwarf backed farther into 
another tangle of vegetation. The call 
came again from the same place. He 
swallowed to stop his heart’s jump- 
ing. Now, beyond the bush, some- 
thing stirred. 

Lightly poised for flight, its 
wedge-shaped head lowered, a young 
talue pointed the bu^. It darted 
forward, stopped, foreleg raised. Its 
head swiveled, cocked, listening to its 
right. 

The call came again from the 
empty bush. 

The dwarfs face was fixed in a 
snarl. There was nothing there. The 
bush called again. Then the talue 
which had been all quivering nerve 
and tension collapsed. The transition 
from vitality to inertia was absolute 
and so swift that Arcweld jumped 
again. It was as if all the delicate 
mechanisms of the creature had im- 
ploded simultaneously. A limp 
bundle of fur lay on the ground 
where life had shimmered only a few 
seconds before. 

Even more terrifying to the dwarf 
was the form that sped suddenly 
across the brake through the dawn. 
He flattened. The Superom looked 
enormous in the strange tree-muted 
light. Arcweld lay, clutching earth. 
His chin rested on dirt and leaves. His 
eyes behind the helmet visor were 
scared but baleful, like a wild ani- 
mal’s. 

He watched the giant pick up the 



little creature. He used it tenderly, 
cradling it in his hands and looking 
down at it almost affectionately. He 
turned it over and plucked a shiny 
bolt from its right hindquarter. His 
long fingers began to probe its 
pouch. 

The faintest rustle, almost softer 
than a breath, disturbed some leaves 
and hoeth needles close to the 
dwarfs right shoulder. The instinc- 
tive fear of things that creep among 
leaves sent a chill slithering down his 
back. 

Delbet was absorbed by his catch, 
but Arcweld didn’t dare to move. He 
tried to see to his right past the visor 
of his helmet, but its curve impeded 
his view. 

Arcweld was as still as stone. His 
breathing hardly moved his ribs, al- 
though he was almost stifled by his 
heart which seemed to be trying to 
hammer itself free. 

The rustling had stopped. With 
painful slowness he began to edge the 
helmet around. He finally caught 
sight of a motionless talue re- 
flected in the corner of the visor. It 
must have picked up his movement 
at the same time. It fled, jetting into 
the undergrowth-quicksilver. Dis- 
covered. 

In the broken fragment of a 
second the dwarf saw the stunned 
talue drop from Delbet’s hands. In 
the same movement, the giant 
reached smoothly down and leveled 



INHERITANCE

the slingbow. Arcweld rolled side- 
ways. A bolt streaked through the 
half-light. Intended for the flying 
animal it clipped the ground a hands- 
breadth behind it. 

Arcweld realized that tlie shot 
hadn’t been aimed at him, but he was 
already committed. On his haunches, 
liis vision spoiled by panic and the 
dark visor, he collided with a tree, 
staggered, turned snarling. He was no 
match for the giant’s speed or the 
slingbow’s deadly bolts. 

Dwarf and giant faced each other 
across a mat of bushes. Delbet’s 
saint’s &ce held a blank stare of 
disbelief. The dwarf, crouched, his 
lips drawn back, awaited the leveled 
bow. He hadn’t expected to be 
caught again at a disadvantage by the 
Superom giant. 

TTien, irrationally, he was alone. 
The clearing was empty. Only the 
inert talue heaped in a different 
bundle and a fragrnent of fire-ore 
gently glowing on the ground where 
Delbet had let it fall proved that the 
giant had been there. He had fled as 
swiftly and unpredictably as had the 
animals he hunted. 

The dwarf looked at the heaped 
talue, the empty glade. Momentarily 
he glimpsed the rhythmic bulk of the 
Superom speeding downhill through 
the trees. He scratched nervously, 
looking around him. Clearly the 
Superom had recognized him, had 
been scared and had mn away. The 



powerful, ruling Superom had run 
from a low-tribe Tlietan. 

Arcweld considered. The dream, 
the strange cries, the sound out of 
the empty bush. He snarled and 
muttered. He needed to get back, 
close to the magical power of the 
thing in the pannier of his steede. 
But it was getting light rapidly. The 
camp woidd be rousing. Starhowl 
would be crawling out of his tent and 
calling the navigation party together. 
Diere was no time. 

The Superom giant had seen him 
defenseless and had run away. Arc- 
weld shivered. Nothing in this dawn 
explained itself. 

He looked around him again, as 
thou^ some^ere in the increasing 
li^t a soiutipii would be revealed. 
There was nothing. The morning was 
empty. The hillskie was still. 

VI 

^^HE Conducs had built a special 
carrier for Karel’s casket. In the 
several hundred years since the com- 
puter-controlled Thetan factories had 
fallen derelict, the Conducs had be- 
come masters oi^ adaptation and im- 
provisation. They had mshed a mo- 
bile workshop to Spadrox and built 
the vehicle in two days. 

It rolled slowly forward now as 
the convoy got under way. A junk- 
heap motorcade creaked and groaned 
into life and moved along with it. 



54 



IF 




They bore delegate chiefs of most of 
the paramount Tlietan tribes. There 
were even some mounted Agorans 
along. Their nervous, sideways- 
skipping cadels shied at the noise and 
skittered in front of vehicles, bring- 
ing a variety of curses from cabs and 
cockpits. 

Shevan and Delbet rode in the 
center of the convoy with the casket. 
It was shielded under a canopy and 
insulated to preserve the functioning 
of its delicate mechanisms. 

Arcweld had no opportunity to 
get a look at the giant. The, Helangles 
job was to act as pathfinders. When 
he got back to camp, Starhowl, 
Kickstart and the others were already 
arguing about whether to go around 
Westward City Three or through it. 

“I say through it, man,” said 
Arcweld. “There’s a sub-traverse 
liighway I dig in W.C. Three. Let’s hit 
it. Going around will take two days 
more.” 

“Shed me, it’s the fireball himself. 
Dig him. He don’t sleep, he don’t jig 
women, he don’t talk to us hardly 
but he walks in out of the dawn and 
has opinions.” 

“One smart Helangle.” 

“What you need is a woman, Arc.” 
“He takes his steede up the hill- 
side.” 

“Catacroc! He burns, man!” 

“Yawl cool it,” snarled the dwarf. 
“What I do, I do.” 

“Som6 Conduc jill beat him up. 



Remember? EHd she detool yawl. 
Arc?” 

“Cool it— cool it,” Starhowl 
warned. He motioned the dwarf 
back. Arcweld had taken a threat- 
ening hop toward the last speaker. 

“What he says is right,” said Star- 
howl. “Through’s faster.” 

“But round’s safer, man,” said 
Kickstart sagely. “Yawl know some 
queer things got holed out in those 
rock jungles. Yawl hit them time to 
time like we do.” 

“Be through on the sub-traverse in 
a day,” said Arcweld. 

Smoke trail sided with Kickstart. 
“Nix. Know Westward C. Three. Take 
day and half.” 

“And what if the sub-traverse is 
blocked?” suggested someone. 
“Could get blown out in the side 
tracks.” 

“Scout it.” 

Starhowl considered. “Okay. 
Scout it. Arc, it’s your mindmap. Go 
scout it. Cleavewind, you go, too.” 
“Nix,” the dwarf protested. 
“Don’t need two. Arcweld goes.” 

“I say two go. Dig?” 

The dwarf shrugged. 

“Smoke, go down tell Shevan 
Lady convay moves toward W.C. 
Three one hour. Helangjes scouting. 
Maybe change course two hours. 
Dig?” 

“Dig.” 

Smoketrail kicked his steede into 
life and rode downhill toward the 



INHERITANCE 



55 




main camp in a series of flamboyant 
curves. 

“Yawl eaten, Arc?” he asked. 

“Not hungry.” 

“Like crazy,” said someone. 

“Like he got sick.” 

“Okay -you ready. Cleave?” 
“Sure.” 

“Let’s hit it.” 

The dwarf shoved his steede down 
onto wheels. Cleavewind jammed 
down his helmet. Tlie two Helangles 
stood hard simultaneously on their 
kickdowns. Their motors roared. 
Wlieel to wheel they soared cross- 
country, making for the cracked and 
rutted highway aimed like a broken 
arrow at the stone jungle crouched 
across the western skyline. 

Wlien they had penetrated about a 
kilometer into the petrified silence 
the dwarf stopped. After a short 
argument he persuaded Cleavewind 
that they should split up. Arcweld 
would reconnoiter to both sides 
while Cleavewind went down the 
traverse to see whether it was clear 
though to the far side. 

Cleavewind didn’t like it, but he 
was less agressive and determined 
than the dwarf, Arcweld watched 
him roar away until he became a 
speck down the traverse. The dwarf 
hauled his bike around. A minute 
later he had zigzagged into a city 
square uphill from the traverse and 
was coaxing the steede in a series of 
bumps and jolts up a concrete ramp 



to one of the pedestrian levels, where 
he could work unseen. 

Six hundred years as nomads had 
made the Helangles instinctively shy 
of being indoors. Arcweld kept the 
engine of his steede running while he 
looked darkly through his visor at 
the crumbling mouths of doorways 
and blind windows surrounding the 
plaza. 

The faint echo of a burst of power 
from Cleavfewind’s motor blown 
down the wind from somewhere on 
the traverse decided him. He had not 
much time if he were to keep the 
rendezvous with his companion. He 
stopped the motor, got off the bike, 
stood it and crouched in the still 
geometry of shadows, unfastening 
the pannier. 

The inside of the nearest building 
was dark. It might have been a shop 
or the lobby of an office at one time. 
Whatever furnishings or fittings there 
had once been had rotted away. The 
place was full of twisted stone and 
steel. 

Arcweld’s lips curled back in a 
snarl of fear and displeasure as he 
waddled through the doorway. He 
supported himself on the knuckles of 
his left hand, crouching, muttering 
under his breath. In the crook of his 
right arm he supported the black box 
he had taken from the pannier on his 
bike. 

He hated the darkness^ but the 
box demanded it. 



56 



IF 




“Where are you?” The voice came 
from a dim image barely visible on 
one side of the box— near the door- 
way there was too much light for a 
clear picture. Still, the face was 
recognizable. 

“Westward City Three,” Arcweld 
said. His voice was cracked and 
hoarse. 

“Yes. That would be about right. 
WeU?” 

“WeUwhat?” 

“You insolent—” Tlie face in the 
box grew distorted. Cruel, dark eyes 
burned like points of fire. “Wliat has 
been happening? Wliat have you 
done? What have you discovered?” 

“Tell yawl a dream I had,” said 
Arcweld. “Or maybe not a dream. 
Tell yawl what I saw, Keren Sir. 
What I saw on the mountain this very 
morning. More— tell you what I 
heard.” 

“Get on with it.” 

Th.e dwarf grinned. He pushed the 
box farther into shadow so that the 
Regent’s face would be clearer to 
liim. He kept his own helmet visor 
down so that the staring eyes in the 
bearded face couldn’t see him prop- 
erly. 

“Was lying up in the camp, five 
kilometers east of W.C. Three,” said 
Arcweld. “Dig? Dawn. Looking at 
stars. Old sun. Freaked out. Great. 
Candy man-” 

“Stop reciting poetry, you 
mutant—” 



The dwarf ignored tlie interrup- 
tion. “There were cries from higher 
up. Queer, like this—” He imitated 
badly. 

“Talue,” Keren said. “Wliat’s-” 

“Talue. But not talue.” 

“You twisted-” 

“Followed them. Explored—” Arc- 
weld went on to tell the story of 
what had happened in the wood 
above tlie camp that morning. Tlie 
half-bred Superom didn’t interrupt. 

“And then the sound came out of 
the bush. Straight. Clear. Right in 
front of me. And there was nothing 
that could have made it— nothing at 
all. Then I saw—” 

But the staring, rigid face glowing 
in the shadow did not hear what 
Arcweld had seen. The whole scene 
swerved. The image of the dwarf flew 
sideways. Keren found himself facing 
darkness. Faint light still came from 
somewhere beyond the range of the 
box’s sensors, but no sound. 

“Arcweld,” he shouted. “Arc- 
weld.” 

There was no response. 

T he dwarf was facing darkness, 
too, but his had suddenly 
spawned tangible shadows that had 
seized him. They dragged him away 
from the black box. A foot kicked 
the box so that it spun. 

Arcweld fought. He bit at some 
wet thing that had been stuffed into 
liis mouth, but it was spongy and 



INHERITAMCE 



57 




wouldn’t tear. He struggled. He was 
powerful, but the silent shadows 
were just too many for him to 
overcome. They entangled him like 
cobwebs. Their limbs were moist and 
chilly. He fought instinctively, wildly 
like an animal, realizing that he had 
been caught by the Submetropols. 

He was pushed, dragged, carried. 
Somewhere behind him he heard 
Keren’s voice bawling from the box. 

They dragged him across a gap and 
over some steps. The dwarf cringed 
at the restricted space that hampered 
his struggles. He loathed buildings. 
He despised the dead and dying 
cubicles and compartments and the 
machines that once had made them 
work. 

Sometiihes when the pack had 
been hunting near one of the stone 
jungles they had pursued the quarry 
into the ruins. Even when he had 
been with his kind the insides of 
buildings had worried him. When the 
cubicle where he now fought began 
to fall he almost died of fright. 

He struggled violently, then lay 
still, choked, all but paralyzed. The 
Submets held him. They were like a 
heap of moist thread. When he real- 
ized that the motion of the cubicle 
was in one direction and controlled, 
Arcweld began to recover. 

It was surprisingly warm in the 
rambling caverns below Westward 
City Three, but the warmth was 
moist, dripping. It penetrated alien 



garments and lungs within minutes. 
It gave Arcweld a sensation of 
drowning. He gasped for breath. 

He felt like a sponge. From the 
foot of the elevator shaft he was 
hustled through so many twists and 
turns it seemed to him he had gone 
through several tunnels. The passages 
were dripping with moisture and so 
faintly lit by crude fire-ore lamps 
that he couldn’t even make out his 
captors’ faces. Twice he fell. He was 
unused to using his legs for long 
distances and the gag was choking 
him. The second time he went down 
a clammy hand hooked it from his 
mouth. The dwarf guessed that by 
now he was too deep in the city’s 
guts for any cry to pierce to the 
surface. 

Tlie tunnel suddenly became wider 
and brighter. Arcweld found himself 
in a broad, low room. light came 
from wall brackets, but its source 
was still fire-ore. He recognized the 
pearly quality of the light. Now he 
could see the Submetropols who had 
captured him. 

Unlike the other Thetan groups 
formed since the end of the Super- 
om, the Submets were not strictly 
homogeneous. They were the least 
progressive human development. 
Their progenitors had been employed 
by the Superom for servicing and 
repairing robot or semi-robot func- 
tions and equipment, most of it 
underground. 



58 



IF 




There had been many grades of 
this type of Thetan worker, some 
bred with special characteristics and 
most with separate tribal identities. 

Following the collapse of the 
system and the old cities they had 
retreated to inhabit the thousands of 
kilometers of submetropolitan space 
where the stopped machines were 
entombed. 

The dwarf had never before seen a 
Submet at close quarters. Now one 
was facing him less than two meters 
away as he was dragged forward and 
released so suddenly that he col- 
lapsed in front of a metal table with 
a creature squatting behind it. 

This one was some kind of leader. 
His dress showed it. He had a pale 
face and sunken, pink-rimmed eyes. 
Weak eyes were a characteristic of 
the undercity dwellers and evolution- 
ary decline would eventually lead to 
the replacement of the Submets’ 
sight with another sense. The pale, 
discolored skin, where it was visible 
at the face and wrists, was moist and 
wrinkled, but for the rest the Submet 
was sheathed in a skintight, silvery 
suit that might have been made of 
plastic or some metal foil. 

“What were you doing in our 
place, upperworld creature?” The 
moist sibilance of the words was like 
the sound of gas leaking from a valve. 

“Minding my business, wetlips. Big 
business. Superom business. Dig?” 

“I’m Possess,” said the Submet 



leader simply. “This city sector and 
its underworld are mine. No one has 
business here that isn’t my business. 
What ransom will your tribe give to 
recover you? Have they sanpardan?” 

The dwarf only identified the final 
word, but it was enough to give him 
the drift of all the rest. Sanpardan 
was a byproduct of cruze. It was 
perilously toxic but an effective stim- 
ulant. Tlie Submets mixed it into a 
drink with water and crude sugar and 
considered it a cure for their chronic 
impotence. They could rarely get 
their hands on enough of it, having 
little commerce with the Thetan 
upperworld. 

Arcweld realized that Possess 
wished to trade him for a cask of the 
sticky fermented jig-juice. 

His first reaction was typically 
Helangle. He grabbed the edge of the 
metal table and shook it till it 
rattled. 

“Gota hell! Waterjerked blind- 
fish!” 

Possess didn’t flinch. A tiny ripple 
of what could have been a smile 
came and went. It seemed to start 
and finish somewhere below his 
transparent skin. 

Arcweld suddenly found himself 
again in the middle of a bunch of 
clammy cobwebs. A dozen Submets 
submerged him. They were all 
around him. They flowed from no- 
where. 

“Sanpardan,” said Possess ear- 



INHERITANCE 



59 




nestly. “You will mark a sheet to tell 
your people you are here. They will 
bring five casks. Sanpardan! Do you 
understand, upperworld creature?’ 
“Hell with you, blindfish. I’m 
hooked to a power party. Superom. 
You dare challenge Superom?” 
“There are no Superom outside 
Spadrox,” hissed the Submet leader. 
“You are insolent. Perhaps we should 
cut off your hand and send it to your 
people and they will bring sanpardan 
quickly to recover you. Perhaps they 
have no sanpardan. What have they 
to trade for you? Have they stuff we 
could trade to the Agorans for san- 
pardan? Answer, upperworld thing! 
Possess is tired of your stupidity.” 
Arcweld sagged between his damp 
guards. He closed his eyes. But his 
brain raced like a high-rewing steede. 

He was in a tough spot. These 
clammy jerkbrains felt too secure in 
their sewers, subways and tunnels to 
be bullied. Still it might be possible 
to turn this thing. 

“Listen— I come from Spadrox. I 
come from Keren Sir. Superom. 
Leader. I’m with him.” 

“What has a Helangle to do with 
Keren Sir?’ 

“You don’t believe, huh?” The 
dwarf stared angrily into the fishy 
eyes of his captor. “Tell your soggy 
strongarms fetch my magic box.” 

The Submet leader stared at him 
blankly. 

Arcweld’s lips curled. He jabbed a 



thick finger into the air. “Up there 
where you grabbed me. A box.” 

“Go upperworld,” Possess or- 
dered. “Pind what he had. Pind this 
box. Bring it to me here.” 

Tlie expedition returned moments 
later. Six of them, panting, dragged 
Arcweld’s steede. Two more carried 
the box between them. 

Possess was not particularly in- 
terested in the vehicle. He knew it 
was one of the smoky, noisy things 
the Helangles rode to get them from 
place to place. The box was silent 
and menacing and had dials and 
knobs and a screen. It was like a 
miniature of parts of the sleeping 
gods that lay under this city. Possess 
understood them and feared them 
and waited for the day the old 
legends said would come when they 
would return to life and the Superom 
would return. 

“Put it here.” 

The Submets lifted it to the table 
top. 

P OSSESS leaned forward and 
stared into the screen. His own 
pale eyes stared back at him. He 
raised them to look over the box at 
the twisted face of his prisoner on 
the other side of the table. 

This box was nothing. It was dead 
like the other dead machine gods in 
the rest of his underworld barony. It 
only gave him back his own face. 
“Dumb!” muttered the dwarf. He 



IF 




levered himself around the table on 
his hands in a series of hops. Half a 
dozen wary Submets clung damply 
to him. 

Arcweld pressed down two white 
keys the way Keren had shown him. 
He held them till they clicked. With 
the other hand he spun the knob 
next to the screen. The screen stayed 
dark, enigmatic. 

It was wrong. Where there should 
have been an image of Keren’s face 
he saw only the reflection of his own 
scowl. 

Arcweld felt trapped, betrayed. He 
shpuldn’t have trusted the cunning 
Superom. Keren had promised him 
would always be tljiere in the box at 
the summoning spell of the keys and 
knobs. He had promised Arcweld 
power in Thetis that no Helangle had 
even dared to imagine. He had prom- 
ised possession beyond the most 
lewd Helangle dream. 

Arcweld struck the box with his 
hand. His frustration and fury es- 
caped in a howl. The Submets closed 
in threateningly. The dwarf slipped 
down to his knees again. 

Possess said something sharply. He 
was leaning forward. His body inside 
the glistening wet suit was tense as a 
spring. Cautiously he put his head 
down and turned a bloodless ear to 
the box. 

Arcweld watched him from under 
jutting brows. The strange, under- 
water smile of the Submet baron 



faltered and pegged itself into place. 

“This god is alive. This god is alive, 
upperworld creature—” 

Suddenly Possess jumped up. He 
seized the box in his arms, shouted 
to the guards. Pive or six of them 
hauled Arcweld to his feet. 

They began half dragging, half 
carrying him back along the previous 
route. When he could look up and 
see through sweat running into his 
eyes the dwarf caught glimpses of 
Possess stumbling along the tunnels 
ahead of the party carrying the box. 

The Submet baron was in a hurry. 
He got to the lifting cubicle only a 
few seconds ahead of the others, but 
started screaming at them im- 
patiently almost at once. He clutched 
the humming box to his chest. His 
head was cocked. He was listening to 
make sure he hadn’t lost the life 
inside the box. Intoxicating dreams 
of sanpardan seemed to have been 
forgotten for the moment. 

Por the second time in an hour the 
dwarf felt his stomach hang sus- 
pended as the chamber moved up- 
ward. 

His captors clung to him. T^e 
chamber flowed slowly up the shaft. 
No manufactured power had been 
available in any Thetan city for 
hundreds of years. This climbing 
cubicle must be operated by hand. 

The motion stopped. Arcweld 
blinked. They were back in the 
rubble-filled hallway where he had 



INHERITANCE 



61 




been ambushed. Even the light in the 
shadowy interior of the building was 
ten times brighter than the gloom in 
the underworld-and the light of the 
failing Thetan sun, shining on the 
terrace outside, was blinding. 

Possess, who had rushed into the 
elevator first, was now last to come 
out. As he stumbled forward, breath- 
ing heavily, the box gave a shout. 
Arcweld jumped. 

Possess nearly dropped the box in 
surprise. The shout became decipher- 
able. Arcweld cowered. The voice of 
Keren flung a stream of common 
language abuse against Possess’ chest. 

Those Submets who had been 
holding the dwarf joined their 
prostrate companions, squirming like 
silverfish. Arcweld’s first instinct w^ 
to escape, but these troglodytes had 
left his steede underground. He 
wouldn’t get far on his withered legs. 
Besides, natural cunning had begun 
to seep through his mind again like a 
drug. He saw a way of using these 
creatures. The box had robbed him 
of a plan when it refused to work in 
the underworld. Now a fresh oppor- 
tunity offered. 

“You brainless Helangle lout,” the 
box was roaring. “You signaled me— 
why aren’t you there? What hap- 
pened to you, you scum of a mal- 
functioning incubator?” 

Stung by the scorn in Keren’s 
voice, the dwarf hopped menacingly 
toward Possess, prepared to wrench 



the box from him. But the Submet 
baron was already overwhelmed. 

He sank to his knees. He was 
trembling. Pearfully, reverently, he 
lowered the box to the floor. 

As he took the box away from his 
chest it was evident from the lively 
flicker of light on the screen that 
the box had resumed its powers and 
that Keren was back. 

A moment later, as Possess flung 
himself onto the fldof, the dwarf saw 
the twisted, enraged face of the 
Superom leader. 

Possess writhed. “You are a 
cunning magician, upperworld crea- 
ture. You have a Superom impris- 
oned in your box—” His face pressed 
to the rubble, he hissed, “Porgive us, 
master, we didn’t know you were in 
there among us.” 

Keren now seemed to be struggling 
to assess the situation. The dwarf 
squatted before the box. He made 
sure he put the heel of one of his 
riding boots squarely on Possess’ pale 
hand. He shifted all his weight onto 
it. The Submet leader groaned, but 
didn’t dare to move. 

“Keren Sir,” fawned the dwarf, 
“this scum jumped me. Rumbled me. 
Dragged me into the guts of this 
goddam jericsville. Dig?” 

“Who?” Keren shouted. “Where 
are you now? What are you talking 
about? .What happened to you?” 

Arcweld was enjoying the experi- 
ence of mystifying the Superom, 



62 



IF 




swapping conversation with one of 
Thetis’ old superior beings while the 
frightened Submets cringed around 
him. 

The Helangle tongue was ideal for 
short colorful narration. The dwarf 
spoke rapidly, confident that the 
troglodytes wouldn’t understand. He 
told his master everything that had 
happened to him since they had been 
interrupted earlier. 

Caught in the rising monosyllabic 
tide, Keren listened without a single 
question as the dwarf suggested the 
Submets might be used in a plan to 
wreck the expedition and restore the 
Regent’s power. 

‘They’re not your old Thetans, 
Keren Sir. They’re dumb. They 
believe in magic. They think the 
machines are dead gods. They think 
I’m a wizard with a slave Superom in 
a box. Box— box— ” he mocked, en- 
joying his power over the squirming 
Submets who groveled harder, 
hearing a word they now thought 
held divine mystery. “Listen. Let’s 
get this together. Yawl speak. Yawl 
tell them they must obey me. Dig? 
Tell them the boy and girl are wizard 
and witch taken over Superom skins. 
Tell them what yawl like. Whatever 
scares them out of their wet hides. 
Say that yawl sent me to rescue the 
casket from the whole wagon train 
that’s under a speU. Dig?” 

“Where is their leader?” 

“Under here,” said Arcweld 



merrily. He indicated his leather-shod 
hindquarters. “I’m sitting on him.” 
“Put him up.” 

Arcweld shuffled sideways, 
making sure to grind Possess’ fingers 
under his heel as a parting reminder. 

“Master!” The Submet baron was 
almost fainting with fear at the pierc- 
ing Superom eyes staring from the 
box. 

“Hear me. Possess.” Keren had 
switched into the Submet tongue. 
His mastery of its sibilances was 
complete. “Arcweld the Helangle is 
my envoy. I speak to him by this 
box. Do your records recall the use 
of these machines by us, your mas- 
ters?” 

“Yes, Keren Sir. Our histories are 
correctly programed and all our ma- 
chines in good order await the illus- 
trious return to Thetis of your 
people, our masters.” 

“Good. Then listen to what I have 
to tell you and then follow the 
instructions of my envoy, Arcweld. 
If you disobey, you and your miser- 
able people may have to relearn the 
sting of the neuro-whip. Do you hear 
me. Possess?” 

“I hear you, Keren Sir.” 

“Tell them to save the giant for 
me,” cried the dwarf. 

“Quiet, you mutant scum.” 
Keren’s eyes tried to pierce the dark- 
ness beyond the trenibling moonface 
of the Submet baron and could not. 
Arcweld said under his breath.

“Yawl can tell them to save the girl 
for me, Master. Dig, baby? If you 
like. Or if you don’t like—” 

But he listened while Keren out- 
lined his new strategy to Possess. The 
role assigned to him was minor, but 
suddenly he didn’t protest. He made 
his own plans instead. 

VII 

N O ONE believed Arcweld’s story. 

He hadn’t expected that anyone 
would. The Helangles and their lan- 
guage were good zX vivid description 
of events, but short on imagination. 

Cleavewind had been back with 
the main body for almost an hour 
when the dwarf returned. Cleave- 
wind’s version of how he and Arc- 
weld separated and how he had 
explored the traverse sounded right. 
So did his quaking account of wait- 
ing in the silences of the stone jungle 
for the dwarf . He told them how he 
had called and searched and gone 
into the dead building. And although 
much of this wasn’t true his recol- 
lected fear made it sound true. 

Starhowl hid his relief under 
anger. When Arcweld rode into camp 
the leader was waiting like an ash 
cloud over a volcano. 

His listened. Helangle justice was 
rough, but it still clung enough to the 
age of the Superom to allow the 
accused to be heard. Not that this 
made any difference. Starhowl had 



already decided to punish the dwarf 
for giving him concern. 

He could have made matters easy 
for himself by referring Arcweld’s 
defection to the two Superom for 
jurisdiction and sentence, but he 
wanted to avoid raising questions 
about his authority to lead the expe- 
dition’s scout party. So he listened 
impatiently and then ordered the 
flogging he had decided on. 

The punishment detail took Arc- 
weld into one of the hillside woods. 
They wanted to make sure no spy 
from the other Thetan groups saw a 
scout humiliated. The dwarf neither 
strug^ed nor argued. 

They made a frame by tying 
branches together. They left his 
insect-head helmet but stripped 
the rest of him. During the process 
they often erupted into howls of 
lewd mirth. Then they trussed his 
heels and hung him head down from 
the frame and lashed him with the 
green shoots of the beor. They made 
the beating easy, grinning and crack- 
ing coarse jokes, because it seemed 
clear to them that the dwarfs ab- 
sence in the stone jungle could be 
explained by a natural Helangle ac- 
tivity. Even as they stripped him it 
had been obvious Arcweld was 
thinking woman. 

Arcweld didn’t make a sound and 
he refused to be drawn out by their 
ribald questions. They cut him down 
and helped him put the clothes on 



64 



IF 




his wealed body. He snapped and 
snarled at them but obviously didn’t 
care. He was thinking about some- 
thing else. He was the first in the 
saddle of his steede. 

Arcweld’s weals were still smarting 
when the vanguard of the expedition 
entered the sub-traverse, but he paid 
no attention. 

Starhowl’s Helangle scouts led. 
Their steedes were throttled down 
and they kept their helmet visors 
fully shut. They fanned out across 
the broad, cracked traverse. Young 
Cleavewind, who had scouted it, was 
at the tip of the cone of riders with 
the dwarf behind and to his left. The 
high-noon sun cut bands of blinding 
light and shadow across the highway. 

Behind the scouts came the Caxi- 
tine Conducs. They were responsible 
for servicing the carrier that came 
next in the procession, bearing 
Shevan, Delbet and Karel’s casket. 

Below his visor, Arcweld’s teeth 
were gritted, his lips drawn back 
from them in his silent grin-snarl. He 
had to keep from looking back over 
his shoulder and he ground his teeth 
till they ached to remind him. 

It was vital that what was going to 
happen didn’t happen too quickly. 
The dwarf didn’t trust anyone, but 
especially he didn’t trust the Sub- 
mets. Their vision in full daylight was 
almost as bad as being blind and 
outside the underworld they dehy- 
drated so quickly that an hour’s 



exposure could mean death. They 
had to carry through Keren’s plan 
precisely. 

Gunning the motor, he pushed his 
steede forward to ride level with 
Qeavewind. The incident of that 
morning, Arcweld’s trumped-up 
story and the subsequent court- 
martial and flogging had disturbed 
the young, Helangle. Even the lewd 
jokes which were now making the 
rounds about the real reason for 
Arcweld’s prolonged absence failed 
to reassure Cleavewind. He felt that 
the dwarf had something evil locked 
iiiside him. 

Arcweld said, “Let’s burn, man. 
Push it. At this pace we’re all gonna 
fall off.” 

Cleavewind turned his head, 
wobbling, holding his balance. 

The helmet and visor hid most of 
his face but the dwarf didn’t miss the 
quick twitch of his lips and knew he 
was scared. 

Qeavewind looked over at Star- 
howl. The Helangle leader was staring 
straight ahead down the traverse. It 
was entering a shallow dip under 
what had once been a complex 
traffic flyover. Starhowl was trying 
to see as far ahead as he could. 

“Huh?” asked Arcweld. 

Qeavewind didn’t answer. He re- 
stored the distance differential be- 
tween himself and Arcweld by a brief 
acceleration, then continued to stare 
ahead, as did his leader. 



INHERITANCE 




Arcweld dropped back. A moment 
or two later he surged forward again, 
impatiently. 

Zooming his motor, Cleavewind 
refused to run level with him, 

The dwarfs parted lips spread 
wider into a grin. Out of the comers 
of his eyes he had seen the Helangles 
to right and left adjusting to keep the 
formation. 

He tipped his bike into a swerving 
arc and with a flush of power surged 
back to the Concjuc section. 

“Move it.” He made a rolling 
gesture at the leading driver. “Bum 
it. Gotta get through before sun- 
down. Don’t straggle.” 

The effect Arcweld was really 
after was the exact opposite of com- 
pactness, He wanted the Conducs 
separated from the Superom vehicle. 
The farther apart the component 
groups were when his plans broke, 
the better. 

Apian, the Caxitine chief, perched 
next to his driver, stared stonily 
ahead, ignoring the Helangle, but as 
soon as Arcweld had gone in smoke 
and noise the Caxitine turned and 
spoke quietly to the driver. They 
increased speed. 

Arcweld soared past the Super- 
oms’ wagon, banked and came up 
beside it. One of the Caxitines was 
driving. It was a heavy vehicle and 
the stench of overheated cruze was 
strong. 

The dwarf pretended not to see 



Shevan but squinted at her through 
his 'dark visor. She was riding just 
behind the driver, next to Delbet. 
The giant seemed to be asleep. 

“Don’t bunch up-dig?” The 
dwarf cupped a hand and shouted at 
the driver. “Road surface busted up 
in places. Keep your distance.” 

With a swift glance over his shoul- 
der whidi took in Shevan ’s small feet 
in their blue sandals, the dwarf laid 
his steede almost flat in a turn, slid 
through the lengthening gap between 
the Superom truck and the last Con- 
duc wagon and roared toward the 
head of the column. 

T he whole expedition was now 
within the stone jungle. Arcweld 
stared up at the buildings. There was 
one with a partly collapsed stone 
staircase. Then came a shallow curve 
in the road; then a structure that 
sprang out of a pedestrian level. It 
had hundreds of blind narrow eyes. 
Farther along the traverse, where 
there was a similar building, the 
highway would narrow and bore 
through a tunnel. The dwarfs 
memory smoldered. 

Starhowl broke file and sped 
across the arc of scouts. He came up 
between Arcweld and Cleavewind. 

“What in hell yawl on? Why break 
rank?” 

‘Tushing on,” Arcweld shouted, 
competing with the noise. “Won’t get 
through the traverse before sundown 



66 



IF 




yawl don’t move it. Yawl want a 
night in the stone jungle?’ 

‘i give orders. You, Cleavewind, 
get Kickstart. Road’s busted. Scout 
it. Make sure it swings. Dig?” 

“Narrows about five hundred 
meters from here,” shouted Cleave- 
wind. “Where me and Arcweld split.” 
He was looking at his mindmap. 
“Through a tunnel, then—” 

Arcweld scowled at the young 
Helangle. 

“Drop to three in line,” said Star- 
howl, “when we hit the tunnel. Keep 
apart. Goddam stone hasn’t taken 
traffic like this for too long. We 
could shake it apart. Arcweld, you 
stay by me.” 

The dwarfs lips framed a curse 
that was inaudible above the noise. 

Whatever he pretended it suited 
him well to ride with Starhowl over 
the next five hundred meters. He 
could hear his heart banging inside 
the black jerkin. The cracked and 
blank faces of the ruins enclosed and 
multiplied the sound of the proces- 
sion and drowned everything else. 
The dwarf thought about the damp, 
colorless creatures waiting below the 
vibrating ground. 

When Arcweld and Starhowl en- 
tered the tunnel the dwarf could see 
the two leading scouts as small sil- 
houettes framed against a sunlit arch. 
A moment before the hated darkness 
swallowed him he also glanced back- 
ward. On the approach section of the 



traverse, beyond the rest of the scout 
pack, came the Conduc file and the 
Superom truck with Karel’s casket. If 
their spacing had been planned and 
measured mathematically it couldn’t 
have been better. 

The stone jungle gave absolutely 
no sign of life. For an instant doubt 
thrust a shaft into Arcweld’s mind. 

He entered the thunderous dark- 
ness of the tunnel. His lips tugged 
themselves back and he felt spittle 
flow. He aimed his steede at the 
bisected ellipse of light ahead of him 
and hoped that the attack wouldn’t 
come too soon. His last look at the 
dead face of the stone jungle had 
bothered him. It had seemed like the 
face of an idiot who forgets every- 
thing immediately after having been 
told. 

The lead scouts were scarcely half- 
way through the tunnel when the 
seeds of panic began to sprout. Arc- 
weld spurted forward reflexively. 

He thought he heard an angry cry, 
drowned immediately by the racket 
in the tunnel. It might have been 
Starhowl’s protest at his indiscipline. 
The next moment the Helangle lead- 
er drew level with him again. 

The dwarf chanced another glance 
back down the tunnel. Now the 
entry arch was also a bright ellipse- 
framed in it was the top of the 
Superom carrier. 

Sweat was running into the cor- 
ners of his eyes. The multiple pro- 



INHERITANCE 



67 




cesses of his own body were all 
accelerating to meet the imminent 
climax. 

It came. 

Starhowl was shouting at him. 
Arcweld figured that the light came 
opening and closing on words that 
had no chance of being heard. The 
noise in the tunnel had increased and 
grown subtly different. There were 
new sounds in it. 

The dwarf looked back again. He 
was just in time to see the bright eye 
of sunlight behind him blink. A voice 
at his ear shrieked for help toward 
the rear, but the dwarfs attention 
was riveted. 

As he watched the eye blinked 
again, then closed finally. Through 
the haze of smoke from the vehicles 
in the tunnel came rolling an acrid 
smell of dust. 

From the dwarfs left a bright 
shaft of light swung back through the 
clouds and confusion. Starhowl was 
invisible in the dust and smoke but 
Arcweld guessed that the light came 
from his steede. He must have 
guessed what was happening a mo- 
ment before Arcweld. He had swung 
around and switched on his head- 
lamp. 

Some of the scouts in the follow- 
ing rank stopped, but those farther 
behind seemed to have panicked. 
They thrust forward too quickly and 
collided with their fellows ahead. 

Starhowl’s light, swinging drunk- 



enly down the tunnel, showed a scene 
of confusion. The roof at the entry 
had caved in and the vanguard of the 
expedition was now cut off from the 
rear. 

One of the leading Conduc ve- 
hicles— a heavy wagon— moving too 
fast in the dust cloud had hit a 
Helangle steede, swerved to avoid the 
unseated rider and collided with the 
tunnel wall. More of the scouts were 
pulling their bikes around and 
bringing their headlights to focus 
back toward the center of the dis- 
aster. 

After a struggle Arcweld turned 
his own steede in the narrow space. 
In the roaring tumult he shuffled 
forward unseen. He rode up on the 
tailboard of the crashed Conduc 
wagon, switched on his lamp and 
tried to make out what was hap- 
pening farther back. 

Was the crisis already over? The 
dwarfs tongue curled out over his 
lips. He tasted dust, sweat. 

Someone was howling loud Hel- 
angle orders. The light beams were 
being better directed. Three of them 
now made a composite cone. Almost 
on the instant it centered on the file 
of stalled vehicles and gesticulating 
figures in the tunnel there were loud 
screams. Arcweld, his mouth eating 
dust and horror, dimly saw a Conduc 
conveyance tilt, then roll backward 
into a great gaping crack that had 
opened in the tunnel floor. 



IF 




The searchlights wavered, then 
picked up the Superom carrier. It 
now had a pile of fallen rubble 
behind it and a yawning hole before 
it-it stood entirely isolated from 
every other vehicle in the expedition. 

In the next ten seconds everything 
happened that the dwarf had heard 
Keren tell the Submets must 
happen— but with nightmarish varia- 
tions no one could have foreseen. 

Up to now the tunnel cave-in 
might simply have been StarhowTs 
prediction coming true. It looked as 
if the unaccustomed traffic had 
shaken the long-disused traverse to 
pieces. But now groups of the under- 
world tribe rose like phantoms from 
the ruins. They swarmed in from all 
sides suddenly, as though exuded by 
cracks in the tunnel’s fabric. Their 
silvery bodies wriggled and flashed in 
the searchlights. They surged about 
the casket carrier like hungry para- 
sites. 



M any of the Helangles and Con- 
ducs had shut down their 
motors to reduce the smoke and 
noise. Now a strange hissing sound 
rose to smother the isolated cries 
from the far side of the chasm. A 
single chilling scream came as some- 
one was dragged from the Superom 
vehicle. The victim’s flailing arms 
disappeared into the hissing, heaving 
trough of silver. 



More Submets swarmed from the 
hole in front of the carrier as the 
scream was drowned. Then several 
voices, Conduc and Helangle, began 
to shout. Fear, rage, belligerence 
were hurled at the ambush. 

Starhowl shuffled his machine to- 
ward the lip of the crater. Several of 
the bolder Helangles joined him, 
shoving aside their injured comrades. 
More and more headlamps came on 
to illumine the scene. But the scouts 
could not bridge the gaping trench. 
Below them lay the wrecked Conduc 
vehicle, its wheels still slowly turn- 
ing. 

One of the Conducs pushed for- 
ward among the bikes. He brandished 
a heavy wrench. Breaking into a run, 
howling threats, he leaped from the 
. edge of the trench. He was trying to 
show the others a way across, but he 
missed. The dark pit swallowed his 
shriek. 

Crouched against the tunnel wall, 
Arcweld silently urged the troglo- 
dytes to get the ambush over. His 
^oved hands clenched the steering 
bar of his steede. He felt his heart 
racing. 

The Helangles’ stunted legs gave 
them no chance of trying to better 
the Conduc’s heroics. Many jumped 
instead from their bikes and tore 
rocks from the edge of the crater, 
flung them at the hissing Submets on 
the other side. 

The attack brought an answering 



INHERITANCE 



69 




barrage of stones. Howls of pain and 
anger roared in the tunnel. 

“The casket— the casket—” some- 
one was bawling. 

A stone ricochetting from the 
curved roof of the tunnel struck 
Arcweld in the mouth below the 
visor. 

Now he had blood as well as sweat 
and dust to swallow. Cursing and 
spitting, he saw the upward surge and 
stagger of Submets as they dragged 
Karel’s casket from its place. 

But on the other side their silvery 
bodies were being flung sharply and 
aggressively aside. The dwarf saw his 
enemy rise titanically, sloughing off 
troglodytes like skin. He flung one, 
turning over and over, into the 
trench. He was fighting with bare 
hands, having been stripped of al- 
most everything. In a moment he had 
disappeared again. 

Arcweld bounced up and down, 
howling ^eefuily, tasting the rich 
salty blood of his enemy. 

“Move it back. Clear the way, 
man— like move—” Starhowl’s shout- 
ing came from far down the tutmel. 
The dwarf couldn’t see what was 
happening but he heard a Conduc 
conveyance start up and begin to 
whine in reverse down the dark road. 

On the island Karel’s casket was 
being rushed on a silver stream 
throu^ a new cavity that had ap- 
peared in the tunnel wall. A great 
wail of anger and frustration rocked' 



the tunnel as the loyal Thetans saw 
their sleeping god disappear. The 
Submets funneled after him, taking 
with them a limp blue bundle that 
had to be Shevan, also held aloft. 

On the near side of the carrier its 
driver lay motionless. On the far side 
a seething mass of Submets was again 
ripped open and Delbet emerged. He 
flung one attacker against the wall, 
another onto the wagon. Weight of 
numbers felled him again and they 
began to drag him toward the aper- 
ture in the wall that must lead to the 
underworld. 

“Go,” bawled Starhowl. “Go get it 
back. Goddam you— move!” 

The dwarf saw a Conduc vehicle 
loom to his right and back slowly 
toward the trench. The Helangle 
leader was going to try to bridge it. 

The Submet attackers on the is- 
land had momentarily lost their hold 
on Delbet. Again he flung several of 
them aside with crushing force. He 
stood up. With a sweep of his arm he 
felled two more. Free for a second, 
he loped with his surprising agility 
toward the trench. He sprang. 

To the watching dwarf it seemed 
that his enormous bulk hung for a 
long moment weightless above the 
pit. 

Arcweld fellii spittle gathering in 
his throat for a hoarse croak of 
triumph as the giant fell. But Delbet 
didn’t fall. He seemed to kick on. He 
landed briefly on the crashed wagon. 




sprang again at once and clutched 
and clung to the lip of the gulf where 
Thetan hands grabbed him and 
hauled him to safety. 

The nightmare experience he had 
just survived arid the violence of his 
struggle seemed to have drained the 
giant’s strength to its dregs. 

He kneeled within a semicircle of 
awe-stricken Thetans. None dared to 
touch him. His head hung down. His 
shoulders heaved as he fought for air. 
He groaned and whimpered. It was as 
if the passion of his experience had 
thrown some mechanism into re- 
verse. He crouched there as though in 
memory of some remote ancestral 
creature at the genesis of his race in 
an unimaginable galaxy. 

The Thetans finally discerned 
some coherence in the phrases that 
were torn out of him. “Shevan— 
Shev^an. Karel—it— Keren— ” 

Lurking at the rim of the group, 
Arcweld peered, snarled and hopped 
uneasily from leg to leg. This was 
wrong. This was a blow to cripple 
Keren’s strategy. Delbet should have 
been safe in the underworld, fast in a 
sticky web* of Submets with the 
others. 

The dwarf stared back across the 
collapsed roadway and at the tunnel 
walls. Would they attack again? His 
mouth dribbled saliva and blood as 
he willed the walls to yawn and 
disgorge the stone jungle’s pale 
dwellers to carry the giant away. 



But they stayed blank. The idiot 
face again. In the new silence, slashed 
by light beams and acrid with dust 
and cruze smoke Delbet’s agony con- 
tinued . “She van— She wy— Karel— it 

was Keren—” 

VIII 

nPHE CONDUCS and Helangles 
sank their antagonisms in their 
common misadventure. They quickly 
formed an alliance to maintain order. 

The dangers of the stone jungle, 
the shock of the ambush and the 
audacity of the theft of Karel’s 
casket had terrified most of the 
Thetans. The expedition threatened 
to disintegrate into rabble. Only joint 
action by the Caxitine chiefs under 
Apian and by the Helangles Starhowl 
and Smoke trail averted wholesale 
panic. 

No one wanted to remain in the 
stone jungle. It was already after- 
noon and night would soon come 
down. 

But Starhowl and Apian argued 
fiercely that it would be best to 
remain where contact might still be 
made with the Submets and a chance 
generated of recovering the kidnaped 
Superom. 

They came first to Delbet for 
leadership. -After all, he looked, 
spoke and dressed like Superom. But 
it wasn’t lost on the shrewd Hel- 
angles and thoughtful Conducs that 



INHERITANCE 



71 




the giant was less powerful now that 
he was alone. 

He seemed lost without Shevan. 
Ideas, if they generated behind his 
handsome, bewildered face, couldn’t 
seem to break free. When the The- 
tans organized a hasty council 
meeting and sat in a circle about him, 
muttering and arguing among them- 
selves, he stared blankly at them. 
When they asked him questions he 
shook his head or muttered unintel- 
ligible snatches of high Superom. 

“Yawl Saivainte,” growled Smoke- 
trail, addressing the council. “Yawl 
Zedward. Yawl got learning— huh? 
Okay, so beat your minds, longshirts. 
Now why would a bunch of insects 
do a thing like that to Superom? 
How yawl figure? How explain that 
kinda thing?” 

Zedward, the dignified leader of 
the Saivainte, raised his bony shoul- 
ders m a shrug. He pulled his cloak 
more tightly to him as though to 
fend off the approaching night. 

“My brothers and I have had little 
time for thought. We consider that at 
last a dark thing may be happening in 
our world. Many of our brothers are 
cut off from us. Thetis is large. There 
are many waters and many stone 
jun^es. Communication has been 
bad for several hundred years and 
does not improve. We have predicted 
for some time that the continued 
interruption of intercourse among 
the tribes will result in the ultimate 



failure of the Superom legend. We 
believe we may have seen the validity 
of our apprehensions demonstrated 
here today. Th6 Submets, who have 
cut themselves off from the upper- 
world, have developed groups which 
are no longer conscious of the Super- 
om nor acknowledge the creed.” 
“Huh?” grunted Starhowl. The 
Helangles all looked blank. Saivainte 
speech was too involved for them. 

“But why did they identify and 
attack the Superom wagon?’ 
snapped Floridian, one of the Con- 
duc leaders. “The removal of the 
casket was deliberate and planned.” 
“We know that if they can catch 
anyone straying into their tenitory,” 
said Zedward, “they hold him for 
ransom. Their way of life has become 
very savage. But it seems incredible 
that they would dare to ransom 
Superom. My brothers and I fear the 
worst. These low-morality creatures 
don’t realize what they have done. 
They have seen the approach of an 
important caravan and they have 
identified and stolen away its most 
important element.” 

“Why don't yawl talk simple, 
man.” Starhowl’s black goggles 
looked like the eye sockets in a skull. 
“Me, Starho^, I say those trogjos 
knew what they were at. I say they 
got paid out by some other pack to 
lift Karel to Mandanar. Dig? What 
yawl say. Smoke?” 

Smoketrail looked nonplused. Ap-

IF 




Ian said, “What we ought to be 
discussing is how do we go about 
getting back Great Karel and Shevan 
Lady. If the casket is damaged-” 

The Thetan leaders stared at one 
another, horrified. A murmur of con- 
cern spread out into the listening 
rows and died in shocked silence. 

Suddenly the giant Delbet whom 
everyone had momentarily forgotten 
struck the air with his fist. “It was 
Keren. Somehow this was Keren’s 
doing.” 

The violence of the outburst was 
so unexpected that several of the 
leaders jumped. Arcweld felt his guts 
contract and he bit his raw lip so that 
it bled again. 

“How could Keren be involved?” 
Zedward questioned. “Spadrox is 
several hundred kilometers behind 
us. Besides, would Keren risk fatal 
damage to the casket— harm to Great 
Karel?” 

The giant’s eyes glazed again. He 
stared at the fading sky. For a 
moment it seemed that he would 
retreat from the discussion, but he 
did speak. Not to the council but to 
something or someone inside his 
head. The watchers saw his lips 
move. 

No one understood him. 

K ICKSTART, the ugly, broken- 
lipped Helangle from Seventy- 
Third City South, was sitting with his 
group nearby. Arcweld leaned to- 



ward him and whispered, “That 
giant’s blown his mind. What use is a 
Superom that dumb? We need Keren 
Sir here. We oughta send for Keren 
Sir. He’d get it together.” 

“Sanpardan,” suggested a voice 
from the far side of the circle. 
“Those underworlders will trade al- 
most anything for that. Maybe if we 
could get enough sanpardan—” 

The speaker was one of the 
chubby little Agorans, thinking in 
terms of commerce as usual. 

Kickstart said, “Arcweld here 
reckons we oughta send couriers to 
Keren. Get him here. He’d organize. 
Get it together. Pull out G.K. and 
Shevan Lady.’ 

Arcweld shrank. He had expected 
Kickstart to arrogate the idea to 
himself, not to mention his name. 

But the mention of Keren seemed 
to galvanize Delbet. He sprang up 
and stared around the circle with 
blazing eyes. 

“No! I will tear this stone jungle 
apart stone by stone before I call my 
cousin. We must send a messenger 
into underworld. We must establish 
contact with these Submetropols. We 
must find out why they stole Great 
Karel and Shevan. We must pay their 
price. And we must get to Man- 
danar!” 

The giant seemed to stare straight 
at Arcweld. The dwarf cowered. 
Only twelve hours earlier, on a hill- 
side above the dty, the sight of him 



INHERITANCE 



73 




had made Delbet run away. Arcweld 
still didn’t know why, but now it was 
his turn to be afraid. For the giant 
didn’t even recognize him. His stare 
burned through the dwarf and disap- 
peared into some distant nightmare. 
Arcweld felt trapped again. He was 
trapped because the innocent giant 
had escaped the Submet ambush. He 
was trapped between this titan who 
had struck him down before on the 
point of conquest and the compelling 
magic box hidden on his steede. The 
box would already be impatiently 
waiting for him to confirm success. 
Arcweld tried to conceal himself in 
the group of scouts as the giant 
stormed on. 

Delbet ’s saintly face was contorted 
by the agony of emotions shackled 
inside him. The conference was being 
held on the traverse beyond the 
tunnel. He took a few uncertain steps 
back toward the darkness. He 
shouted something in high Superom. 

Then, abruptly, he turned. In lan- 
guage the shivering listeners could 
understand he shouted, “I, Delbet, 
will lead you into the underworld. I 
will find Shevan Lady and Great 
Karel. I will hunt their captors down 
like-like the-” His eyes glazed 
again. He clutched his head, stared at 
the ring of Thetan faces as though he 
couldn’t understand why they were 
there. 

Zedward rose unhurriedly to his 
feet. He was almost as tall as a 



Superom. He looked both splendid 
and dignified as he wrapped his cloak 
around him, walked to the young 
giant and took his arm. Apian the 
orange-haired Caxitine joined him. 
Starhowl scuttled forward, too. To- 
gether the Thetans led Delbet back 
from the tunnel mouth. 

The giant shook his head, 
“Shewy— Shevan— used to tell me 
about what she found in the talk- 
tapes— something in the underworld 
that struck fear—” 

“Delbet Sir, come— sit. Calm in all 
things.” The Saivainte spoke with 
quiet compassion. 

Arcweld turned to Smoketrail. 
“We got to get Keren— dig? If not we 
lose G.K. and the girl.” 

Smoketrail stared at the dwarf, 
but made no response. He looked at 
the group leading Delbet back to the 
council ring. Arcweld discovered that 
neither Smoketrail nor anyone else 
was taking particular notice of him. 

If only those underworld blindfish 
had taken the giant. If only he could 
explain to the black box in the 
pannier and bring Keren from Spad- 
rox . 

Delbet had stopped again. His 
body became rigid. He seemed on the 
verge of a fit. He shouted up at the 
blind eyes of the city. 

“Shevan said— the talk-tapes from 
the broken library told of the amber 
fog— a creature that terrified the Sub- 
mets. It hunted them—”

IF 




The Caxitine and the Saivainte 
stared blankly at one another. Star- 
howl squatted in front of the giant, 
staring up at him, mouth open, any 
expression smothered under the 
death’s-head helmet. 

Arcweld had worked his way 
throu^ the crowd to Kickstart’s 
side. “Must call Keren. Giant’s blown 
his mind. He’s wrapped. Finished. 
Dig?” 

Kickstart hardly moved. He was 
watching. 

AN OLD Saivainte had risen from 
among his small tribal group. A 
patched cloak that had once been a 
magnificent historian’s purple hung 
from his shoulders. 

“I think I know what he means. 
Ye3— the life form was recorded in 
the early ages^ of Thetis and in the 
making of the first stone jungles.” He 
coughed, waited to see that he held 
his audience. “The Superom lost 
many of the subjects they trained to 
maintain tjie underworld. They 
fell prey to a primeval Thetan crea- 
ture. It was drawn, as though hyp- 
notized, to the short-wave radiation 
of the machines and came into con- 
flict with the Submetropols in the 
process.” 

Delbet shook his arms free of the 
Thetan chiefs’ hold. He strode to- 
ward the old historian. He bent down 
until his face was level with that of 
the old man. 



“You know?” he breathed. 
“Yes— that’s the story Shewy had 
from the talk-tapes.” 

The old man continued. “The 
Superom could not afford the losses 
of their trained underworld crea- 
tures. They exterminated the at- 
tackers ruthlessly— the Thetan word 
for the creature was witawu. The 
aipber fog.” The old Saivainte 
frowned doubtfully. “Stories persist 
that in the more remote parts of 
Thetis hives of the witawu continue 
to exist. I have seen no proof, but—” 
“Hold on there.” A new voice 
broke into the silence. Pushing for- 
ward, Arcweld saw that the speaker 
was an Agoran. He was round- 
bodied, with the bald, bony skull and 
quick brown eyes of so many of his 
people. His name was Mutch. “Some 
of our lot go to the West Water to 
trade every fall. There’s a Conduc 
group up there. Can’t remember 
what they call themselves, but they 
live on the North Shore. Our men 
reckon they keep a queer sort of 
creature in hives. They get a kind of 
sticky sweet juice that they sell—” 
The Saivainte historian nodded 
vigorously. The jigsaw of his 
memories found another piece that 
fitted. “Yes, the witawu used such a 
substance to feed their young and to 
cement their underworld hives.” 
Zedward said gravely, “Domesti- 
cated witawu? But what—” 

Delbet spun around to face him.

“We must go at once to the West 
Water.” 

The Thetans looked at one an- 
other. Then their eyes turned again 
to the giant. In the silence that had 
suddenly come down Arcweld could 
almost hear the Voice in the box 
screaming at him. Triumph had been 
so near and was now slipping be- 
yond his power to hold it. 

When yawl down, man, they all 
grind yawl Everybody rides over 
your face . , . 

A moment later the dwarf heard 
his name spoken. His thoughts were 
still wild with fear and linked the 
sound with the voice in the box. He 
crouched, ducked his head and 
hunched his shoulders as though to 
ward off a blow. Then, as he stared 
at the ground and nothing struck, he 
heard his name again. And this time 
it was not the voice in his head. This 
time he recognized the speaker as 
Starhowl. 

“. Cleavewind, too,” the Hel- 
angle was saying. “They have the 
mindmaps of this zone. Mutch will 
go with yawl, too— huh Agoran? 
Your people have contact with this 
Conduc outfit. Apian, there oughta 
be a Conduc on the trip. Like prov- 
ing it’s for real and no sham. Dig?” 

Arcweld shambled almost auto- 
matically into the bare center of the 
council circle. He still hadn’t realized 
what was happening. Then he saw 
the giant staring at him. 



F or the second time that day 
giant and dwarf confronted one 
another. Delbet’s mouth opened. 
Arcweld knew that he was recog- 
nized this time. 

“Yawl, Arcweld.” Catching the 
giant’s fixed stare, Starhowl had 
turned. “Ylwl and Cleavewind go 
with Delbet Sir. Like fast. Mutch and 
one of the Conducs, too. How long it 
take yawl make the North Shore of 
West Water? Shed?” 

_ Arcweld shook his head. “I don’t 
have a mindmap— ” 

Starhowl roared, “What’s hit 
yawl? Yawl and Cleavewind guide 
this task force real fast to North 
Shore. Delbet Sir will talk out the 
Conducs there. Yawl get back here 
with some help—” 

Arcweld ’s lip was trickling blood 
again. He was leaning so hard on his 
knuckles that he could feel agonizing 
grains of stone biting into them from 
the roadway. He was conscious of 
hundreds of eyes turned on him. 

Starhowl seemed on the point of 
exploding into action-Delbet’s voice 
came just in time to save Arcweld his 
second flogging of the day. 

“This dwarf will not refuse to save 
my cousin, Shevan?’ 

The silence was as frail as a 
bubble. Arcweld opened his mouth, 
but his voice broke in his throat. 

“Well dwarf?” Delbet seemed 
suddenly enormous. Arcweld fecalled 
the blow in the darkness. Rage 



76 



IF 




welled up in his chest, but the fear of 
loneliness among his own kind was 
stronger. His tongue stroked and the 
taste of the blood on his lip unlocked 
his vocal cords. 

“I said I didn’t have a mindmap,” 
he growled. “I meant my mindmap ’s 
thin. Sure I’ll go. I guess it’ll take 
maybe one— two days.” He con- 
tinued to croak amends but, like a 
spider laboriously pitching the first 
thread of a web between twigs, he 
could intuit a new design for his 
vengeance behind his words. 

Night was falling. From the night 
in his mind the dwarf looked down 
the traverse toward the North Shpre 
and the long highways between it 
and the stone jungle. This Superom 
needed him the way the other had 
needed him. Out there a Helange 
would hold an advantage. 

He stared up balefully at Delbet, 
but now the giant ignored him. 

Delbet turned to the Thetan 
chiefs. For the moment he had taken 
on Superom authority. “Apian, you 
will choose me one of your people. 
Perhaps we shall need an interpreter. 
These remote Conducs will not ever 
have seen a Superom and we must 
not terrify them with our mission or 
its purpose. 

“Starhowl, see that this reluctant 
dwarf and the other you named are 
ready to leave in an hour. We can’t 
lose any time-we must start out 
tonight. 



“Zedward, my thanks to you and 
your people again. When we bring 
Great Karel to Mandanar safely and 
the secrets are revealed, you and the 
Saivainte diall have your rewards. My 
people don’t ever forget such de- 
votion.” 

Dusk had begun to creep along the 
traverse. The Thetans lit their lamps 
and many braziers of fire-ore to 
chase away the fearful darks of the 
stone jungle. 

On the edge of the scout camp the 
dwarf lay next to his steede on the 
hard roadside. His insect-head helmet 
rested on the pannier, inside which 
he felt the unyielding box -the magic 
that demanded. He muttered and 
fidgeted. 

A hairy female scuttled up, yick- 
ered, fawned, and put her hand on 
him, misjudging the reason for his 
discomfort. 

' He struck her away and snarled 
after her until she had disappeared, 
growling and whimpering, ampng the 
tents. 

Arcweld stared up at the sky. In a 
half-hour they would be moving 
through the night toward the West 
Water. 

Tenderly his tongue explored the 
healing lip. It still had a raw metallic 
taste. Around and around went his 
thoughts, painfully drawing out 
thread after thread, spinning and 
spinning. 

TO BE CONCLUDED

I 

OST of the staff of Explor- 
-!‘^-®^atory Ship E-12 had assem- 
bled in the generaUroom to hear 
officially what they had already 
learned in part via the grapevine. 
Captain Fell and Dr. Latham 
came in last and threaded their 
way toward the small dais. 

The captain let his eyes slide 
over the room, making a quick 
head count. Then he said, “You all 
know something about our pres- 
ent unusual situation. We came 
out of warp for a routine position 
check and quite accidentally in- 
tercepted a repeating radio 
message in real space. It was an 
appeal for help from the planet 
Valora. The message was weak 
and full of noise, but we cleaned it 
up and were able to read it. It de- 
scribed a plague of insects, spe- 
cifically hornets. Semantic anal- 
ysis indicated that the problem 
was real and urgent. At least the 
sender considered it so, though it 
obviously made little sense for 
him to be reporting an emergen- 
cy the nearest trading planet 
wouldn’t learn about for years, if 



ever. However, he was lucky — we 
happened along. I elected to devi- 
ate from our current assignment. 
We reentered warp and, with only 
one adjustment, arrived in an 
eight-to-one orbit around Valora, 
a satisfactory piece of astroga- 
tion. We are now making further 
adjustments to a nearly circular 
orbit at roughly fifty thousand 
kilometers. Four and a half hours 
from now we will put down a land- 
ing craft under the command of 
Sam Lacey. Dr. Latham will give 
you the rest of the story as far as 
we know it and will outline our 
plans.” 

Latham rattled his pipe between 
his teeth and said, ^Those of you 
who have lived on Earth will know 
that hornets and wasps are Ter- 
ran insects ranging in size from 
nearly microscopic to several 
centimeters in length. There are, 
as I recall, some thousands of 
species, many of which can inflict 
painful stings. From the note of 
hysteria implicit in the call for 
help, it would seem that Valora’s 
hornets are of a particularly un- 
pleasant type. Since the planet has 
been settled for twenty-one un- 
eventful years it is unlikely that 
these could in fact be Terran hor- 
nets, accidentally transplanted 
and only now becoming a 
menace. It is more probable that 
they are a native species. How 



THE HORNETS OF VALORA 



79 




they could have built up to plague 
levels without having been pre- 
viously reported, we do not 
know. 

“We probably cannot provide 
any direct aid. If insecticides or 
biological predators are needed 
we can perhaps suggest methods 
or agents and pass the word to the 
nearer trading planets. Our im- 
mediate job will be to get some de- 
tailed knowledge of the problem. 

“I could play you our tapes on 
Valora, but there would be a lot of 
nonpertinent detail, so I’ll high- 
spot. The planet was explored by 
one of our ships some thirty years 
ago and was recommended for 
occupation by an agricultural 
society. It had a mild climate, no 
volcanic activity, adequate 
rainfall, plant life that could nour- 
ish Terran animals and fertile 
soil that would be receptive to 
Terran crops — it was, in short, 
suitable for settlement with mini- 
mum risk. There were numerous 
small animals and a few larger 
herbivores somewhat like Terran 
deer — none higher than point six- 
teen on the intelligence scale. 

“On the other hand, Valora was 
virtually devoid of heavy ele- 
ments. It was recognized that she 
could develop no important in- 
dustry in the foreseeable future 
and could hardly hope to join the 
trading planets. The Interworld 



organization therefore has fur- 
nished — gratis — isotopic power- 

packs, drugs fliers, communica- 
tion equipment and such other 
items as are needed to sustain a 
simple society. Otherwise she 
has been left more or less alone. 
She has no interplanetary ships 
and no subspace communica- 
tion facilities. Her present popu- 
lation is no more than a few hun- 
dred thousand. In many respects 
she is a rather primitive planet. It 
may well be that Interworld re- 
gards her as something of a social 
experiment. 

“Settlement was accomplished 
in the year two thousand forty- 
six, after a considerable delay. 
The initial exploration had re- 
vealed that, three years earlier, 
there had been a planetwide epi- 
demic among the larger herbi- 
vores. There were, as I said, few 
living specimens and many skele- 
tal remains were found. The nor- 
mal period for microbiological 
studies was therefore extended. 
Some moderately pathogenic 
organisms were found and both 
settlers and livestock received 
appropriate immunization. 

“Now — as soon as we’re in sta- 
ble orbit Sam Lacey will set down 
with four exploratory teams of 
five men each. Each team will in- 
clude one military man with ex- 
perience in a variety of real and 



80 



IF 




simulated extraterrestrial stress 
situations, a paramedical tech- 
nician and a zoologist. Sam will 
pick the other men he wants. You 
will, of course, make a number of 
contacts with Valoran settlers 
and to the extent possible you 
will look at various ecological 
environments. Bring back first 
and even second-hand reports on 
the distribution and behavior 
patterns of the insects and the 
steps taken to combat them. 
Equally important, bring back 
some hornets, dead if necessary, 
alive if possible. You will have 
nets and cages. What else should be 
covered, Sam?” 

“We don’t know much about the 
problem,” Sam observed. “We’ll 
be playing it by ear. I’ve already 
made team selections and I’ll stick 
the list on the bulletin board, with 
apologies to all those left out. 
We’re issuing regular temper- 
ate climate gear with fitted gloves 
and close-weave headnets. Any- 
body with any special knowledge 
of hornets, come and see me. 
Regulation weapons will be car- 
ried, though we can’t think there’ll 
be any use for thiem. Our two 
psychologists will be going 
along, with the expectation that 
two teams can be set down close to 
towns or villages. The other two 
teams will take a look at unsettled 
arpas. 



“As nearly as you can plan such 
things in advance, we’ll figure to 
rendezvous with each team after 
four or five ship’s hours. Til have 
a chance to make a low-level sur- 
veillance of a good deal of terri- 
tory and maybe talk to a few peo- 
ple. I’ll report to the ship once 
each orbit. We’ll aim to have a 
complete enough picture to be 
back aboard in fourteen hours at 
the outside.” 



44^AM LACEY here. Do 

^you read me? Okay, get it 
on tape. I’ll give you as much as I 
can while you’re over my horizon. 
Things are a hell of a mess down 
here. From the contacts I’ve made 
directly, the planet is approach- 
ing a state of panic. 

“No problem putting down the 
teams. First one close to a town in 
a big river valley. Second in a 
farming community, partly 
wooded terrain. Third near a 
southern hemisphere seacoast 
with scrub growth and marshes. 
Fourth on a high, rather arid pla- 
teau — cattle country. Since then 
I’ve made stops at two towns and 
talked to a dozen or so people, all 
badly scared. 

“We were dead wrong about the 
hornets. What they have is noth- 
ing like any Terran bug. They 
stand about half to three-quarters 



THE HORNETS OF VALOR A

of a meter high and look like a 
football on legs. 1 was able to 
examine a dead one. Somebody 
had broken its legs with a cudgel. 
They die when that happens — or 
if their bodies get punctured. 
You’ll get specimens when we’re 
back aboard. 

“Some newscaster started call- 
ing them hornets and the name 
caught on. They do sting and they 
sting to kill. There have been a lot 
of human deaths — my guess is 
several hundred to a thousand — 
not to mention animals, cattle 
and goats mostly. Even if this 
mess can be cleaned up fast, Va- 
lora will need help to get reestab- 
lished. 

“The hornets have apparently 
been living underground — deep 
down where nobody ever discov- 
ered them — since before the set- 
tlers arrived. Somewhere I think 
I’ve heard of an Earth-type bug 
that lives underground for seven- 
teen years, then comes out and flies 
for a season. But these things 
don’t fly — they jump. The body, 
the one I examined, was like a 
bladder covered with thin leath- 
ery skin. Inside they seem to have 
a backbone and a few other bone&r 
They have these two legs, jointed 
so they can jump, and two upper 
appendages I guess you could i:all 
arms, with sharp hooks on the 
ends. The arms and legs are tough 



and sinewy. Then there are four 
smaller appendages on each side 
of the body which may be used for 
digging when they’re in the 
ground. They have no heads as 
such, unless you want to figure 
the mouth area as a head. The 
mouth is circular, about three 
centimeters across and ringed with 
nasty-looking teeth. When ,they 
attack they come out of a crouch, 
launch themselves in a shallow 
trajectory, dig their hooks into 
whatever they hit and shove a 
sting — like a spring-propelled 
hypodermic needle — out of their 
mouths. The one I saw had a sting 
six centimeters long. When that 
hits you you’ve had it. They haven’t 
any eyes — or none that I could see. 
They jump about five to ten me- 
ters, depending on who’s telling 
it. As soon as their victim is dead 
they start feeding and all the hor- 
nets in the neighborhood get the 
message somehow and come 
rushing up to get in on the meal. 
This I don’t want to watch. 

“There were only a few hornets 
at first, but the numbers have been 
building up fast. Some places 
haven’t had any at all, while a few 
kilometers away communities 
have been reduced to a few survi- 
vors staying locked up in their 
homes. There isn’t any food emer- 
gency — not yet. Food distribu- 
tion is all short haul and most 



82 



IF 




houses even out in the country 
have pumps and piped water. 

“There’s just about no central 
government here. Every town of 
more than a couple of hundred 
people has a mayor. The mayors 
are supposed to form a sort of 
general council, only it seems they 
rarely get together. News dissemi- 
nation is spotty and unreliable. 
No visual telecasting, but every 
family has a radio and news is 
broadcast three times a day. 
Trouble is there are no paid news- 
gatherers. The stations broadcast 
whatever news items are brought 
in to them and half the items are 
wrong. So nobody knows how 
many people have died. Nobody 
knows whether the hornets are still 
on the increase. Nobody knows 
who could have authorized that 
crazy broadcast about hornets. 

“Maybe some other planet 
would have been able to put up a 
better defense, but it seems the 
Valoran colony was recruited 
from one of those sects that doesn’t 
believe in killing. From the way 
they tell it, there isn’t one man in a 
hundred who has a gun and knows 
how to use it. Hell, they’re even 
vegetarians. They’ve changed 
their minds about killing when it 
comes to hornets, but they’re not 
very good at it. 

“Right now I’m drifting on au- 
tomatic hover at about twenty 



meters. A minute ago I could see 
a swarm of the hornets and a col- 
lection of holes in the ground 
where they must have come out. 
They’re said to be white when they 
emerge and then to turn red. These 
were reddish. 

“I’m worried about our teams, 
naturally. They were put down 
with the idea that they’d be look- 
ing for insects of a reasonable 
size. Their collecting gear won’t 
be worth a damn and I don’t think 
their fatigues will give them much 
protection. Of course they have 
their lasers and rifles. I’m going 
back to the pick-up points ahead of 
schedule. Hope they’ve stayed 
close to their beepers. 

“Your echo is fading — so that 
ends this message. I’ll have some 
of the men aboard by your next 
trip around. Lacey signing off.’’

J OHN WRIGHT shifted in bed 
and muttered a profanity. The 
heaped pillows were a poor excuse 
for sitting up. He had promised, 
more or less, to stay put until his 
wife returned, but then, she had 
never had a cast on her leg and 
didn’t know what it was like. The 
plaster extended from his instep 
to halfway up his thigh. It didn’t 
hurt any more. The doctor must 
have done a good job setting the

breaks, but the leg itched like mad. 
He could get his fingers under the 
top of the cast and scratch, but on- 
ly for a little distance. With extra 
caution, in view of the promise, 
he swung crosswise of the bed, 
lowered the unbending leg to the 
floor and tried the unfamiliar 
crutches one way and another un- 
til he could lift himself to his feet. 

Elizabeth ought to be back from 
town soon. She was some overdue 
already, which meant she had 
done other errands or that she 
was having trouble getting a 
powerpack to fit their old-fash- 
ioned radio. It hadn’t worked for 
weeks, but it was only now when 
he had to lie around like a damned 
useless lump that he missed it. 

He inched his way carefully 
across the floor. It wasn’t the first 
time he had navigated on the 
crutches, but other times Eliza- 
beth had been standing by ready to 
grab an arm. It went very well. He 
wanted to be on the porch, sitting 
in the big chair wih his leg propped 
up on another, where he could 
look out over the orchard. Boughs 
were beginning to bend down 
with the weight of the fruit, which 
would be coloring up shortly. 
Soon he must set dates for the 
pickers. 

The porch itself was in shade 
but golden sunlight filled the nar- 
row valley. The scene was much 



like the apple country back in 
Oregon, a place and time he could 
remember vividly. Still in his 
middle years, Wright was never- 
theless one of the older people on 
Valora. 

The big chair wasn’t as com- 
fortable as he had expected, but 
he settled down and pondered 
how best to go_about harvesting 
while he himself was out of com- 
mission. From time to time he 
squinted toward the gap in the 
hills, where Elizabeth’s flier would 
be appearing. 

He caught a small movement 
from the tail of his eye and brought 
his gaze around. What he saw was 
utterly incredible and loath- 
some. A thing was standing a few 
meters away and watching him 
intently. At least it gave the im- 
pression of watching, of riveting 
its attention upon him, although 
he could not see its eyes. Its globu- 
lar body was a dirty white in color. 
It stood on jointed legs and held 
jointed — arms? — away from its 
sides as if to maintain balance. 
He had never seen or heard tell of 
anything like it, but he knew 
from deep instinct that it was 
inimical and dangerous. He 
threw his weight forward and 
scrabbled on the floor for his 
crutches. As he did, the ugly beast 
crouched and launched itself in a 
shallow leap directly at him. In 



84 



IF 




clumsy panic he was still trying to 
gather himself when the thing hit 
him at waist height and instantly 
dug claws through the thin fabric 
of his shirt and into his flesh. He 
gave up the crutches and beat at it 
futilely with both hands. The 
chair crashed to one side and he 
fell. Terror and despair filled him 
for a moment — then there was no 
room in him for anything but pain. 
A sharp proboscis, tough as 
whalebone, had been plunged deep 
into his abdomen. The puncture 
of vital parts was trivial. The 
flood of nerve poison coursing 
through his blood carried agony to 
every fiber of his being. Twice 
his hands beat against the floor be- 
fore he lost even that semblance of 
muscle control. The circular rim 
of teeth that surrounded the pro- 
boscis began a semi-indepen- 
dent motion, tearing at his flesh 
as the hornet started to feed. In a 
minute it was joined by two oth- 
ers. 

Elizabeth’s flier came in through 
the break in the hills and settled 
toward the landing area. 

T here was only one breed of 
dog on Valora, a sort of rough- 
haired shepherd with wide skull, re- 
spectable intelligence and a de- 
gree of independence engen- 
dered by life on the new planet. 
The first ones had been brought out 



at not inconsiderable cost by 
original settlers who felt the need 
for an additional tie with the 
Earth they were abandoning. For 
a time the dogs had belonged to 
households, but many had taken 
to the wilds and formed into 
packs. They were friendly to man, 
for that was their heritage, but 
they had become standoffish. They 
lived by hunting small animals — 
only rarely did there appear a 
rogue which would pull down 
sheep. Many farm dogs also sup- 
plemented unexciting, vegetarian 
table scraps by a daily hunt. 

Between Wally Craig and his 
dog, Tiger, there existed those 
bonds of understanding and af- 
fection which, curiously, can 
unite these two different species. 

Some word about the ugly little 
animals that here and there were 
clawing their way up through Val- 
ora’s friable soil had found a place 
on the newscasts over the past 
days. The reports were a matter 
for curiosity rather than alarm. 
The notion that bugs could be dan- 
gerous was regarded as the prod- 
uct of somebody’s imagination. 
In any case, none of the creatures 
had been sighted anywhere near 
Riverside. 

It was taken as a matter of 
course during summer vacation 
that Wally should wander off 
somewhere immediately after

breakfast. Without definite plan 
he turned his steps down the length 
of the main road and on toward the 
river where his contemporaries 
would be gathering. Halfway 
there Tiger, ranging along the 
edge of the woods, discovered 
something that merited instant 
attention and gave voice. His 
bark didn’t indicate any of the 
kinds of small game he often 
scared up and sometimes caught. 
He sounded querulous and 
alarmed. Wally whistled and when 
Tiger failed to come he decided 
to investigate. The dog was 
standing at the edge of the scrub 
growth facing into the deeper 
wood, his muzzle elevated to 
sample the breeze, his lower jaw 
quivering a little in excitement. 
He was clearly alarmed by some- 
thing and took to whining. Wally 
gave him a word of reassurance 
and moved quietly into the green 
shade of the trees. 

The hornet’s body was so dark a 
red as to be nearly black, and in 
the dense shade it was nearly in- 
visible. Wally was within five me- 
ters of the thing before he saw it. 
Tiger, his sight assisted by a 
keen nose, saw it a fraction of a 
second sooner. They stood side by 
side. Faced by this fearful un- 
known, Wally experienced shock 
but had not yet galvanized his 
muscles to turn and run. 



The hornet leaped. Its limited 
sensory system, primarily heat- 
seeking, failed to detect a small 
tree limb. It struck the limb, 
dropped and landed on legs al- 
ready bent for a second leap. The 
way was clear then and it launched 
itself again toward the larger 
quarry. Wally’s mind shouted run 
but he had not even made a move 
when Tiger and the hornet col- 
lided in midair. Tiger’s jaws 
closed on the globular body and 
crushed, while the horrid spine 
thrust deep into his throat. 

Once out of the shadow of the 
trees, Wally halted his headlong 
flight, looked back and realized 
that he was alone. He called in a 
tremulous voice — then, forcing 
every step, slowly made his way 
back. Tiger was dead. Wally 
looked into the nearly closed eyes 
and could be sure of that. He 
turned and ran again and did not 
stop until he burst, panting and 
sobbing and holding the stitch in 
his side, into his own home. 

F or a generation or two most 
newly settled planets adhere to 
a vigorous work ethic by virtue of 
necessity, if not universal in- 
clination. But there will always be 
some exceptions, some indivi- 
duals who remain convinced that 
their world owes them a living. 
Jacob Pryne was a supremely

IF 




lazy man. He was also an incur- 
able drunk who resisted all ef- 
forts to rehabilitate and clean him 
up. How he Had ever contrived to 
pass the colonization screening 
tests had remained a matter for 
discussion for two decades. He 
lived alone in an incredibly dirty 
shack on the outskirts of the farm 
community of Barford, where 
he brewed a fairly drinkable beer 
and made from it a distilled liq- 
uor he proudly called brandy. His 
food requirements were not great 
and were met by begging or occa- 
sionally stealing. Old Jake was 
not, however, a serious nui- 
sance. He was tolerated and let 
alone. 

Even in the gentle climate of 
that latitude he had in recent 
years always felt cold and his clos- 
est approach to work was the 
maintaining of a constant supply 
of firewood — windfalls from the 
forest and waste from the nearby 
lumber mill — so that there was 
always a fire in his fireplace and a 
stock of fuel for his still. If he was 
sometimes lonely he did not no- 
tice it. There was always another 
drink at hand to take thejjlace of a 
friend. 

The tinkle of drops of white 
lightning from the end of the con- 
denser and the crackling of the fire 
made a familiar background of 
sound and, if the loosely hinged 



door creaked as it swung open, he 
did not hear it. Only when he felt 
the touch of a cool breeze on his 
neck did he gather himself and 
twist around to see who might have 
entered. 

The hornet that had found his 
unlocked door stood quite still, its 
thermotropic sense confused by 
the sources of heat in the stuffy 
room. “Christ,” Jake said aloud, 
“I got ’em. I got ’em bad.” In ad- 
dition to the devil or whatever it 
was that menaced him, he was 
suddenly dizzy and began to get 
the shakes. If the dizzies kept on he 
would very likely fall down and it 
would be bad to fall down with that 
thing right there ready to get him. 
He pushed himself erect, then had 
to hold to the back of the chair for 
a minute till he was steadier. 
When he let go he fell down after 
all and one hand went right into 
the fireplace. He screamed at the 
pain, then forgot it and threw a 
great, burning brand at the devil. 
It missed and the devil jumped and 
hit the still. Now there was noth- 
ing to do but get out of here. Jake 
began the journey on hands and 
knees. He didn’t get far. 

Volunteer fire fighters did 
their best with the blaze, but the 
structure was matchwood. They 
were lucky to keep it from spread- 
ing. 

There had been no hornets in 



THE HORNETS OF VALORA

the area. Even when, late the fol- 
lowing day, they were able to rake 
through the ashes and rubble and 
discovered old Jake’s body no one 
recognized that he had been Bar- 
ford’s first victim. 

I^ZRA COM FORT said, look- 
ing at his daughter Amanda, 
“Somebody’s got to fetch back 
the goats.” 

Amanda continued to spoon 
cereal determinedly and did not 
look up. 

“Your mother’s housecleaning 
and I’ve got to go on plowing the 
fallow land. It looks as if you’re 
elected.” 

“I hate goats,” Amanda stated. 

“You don’t have to like them. 
Just bring them back,” her father 
said. “They’re up the hill beyond 
the waterfall. You can go over to 
Polly’s afterward and you can 
stay there to lunch if your mother 
says so and they’ll have you.” 

Mollified to a degree, Amanda 
spread jam on buttered bread. 
Mrs. Comfort gazed consider- 
ingly at her tall young daughter 
and regretted the decision she and 
her husband had reached the night 
before, after the late news- 
cast — to keep their lives as normal 
as possible in spite of the rather 
frightening tenor of the news. 
The things they were calling hor- 
nets were being reported all over 



the southern continents, but 
there were only scattered reports 
in the north, from the great valleys 
for the most part. Here in the high- 
lands, which sloped upward to the 
divide, there had been only a few 
stories and these perhaps untrue. 
Amanda was quite old enough to 
understand the risk — if in fact 
there was any — and to keep a 
watchful eye for anything un- 
usual. With conscious effort she 
forbore to voice any additional 
warning as the girl took her leave. 

Amanda pushed out her lower 
lip to remind herself that she was 
feeling aggrieved, but the day was 
altogether too pleasant for her 
to sustain -the mood. The sun 
shone. She’d be spending most of 
the day at Polly’s. In two weeks 
she’d be going away to school en- 
tirely on her own and with a lot of 
new clothes. 

She reached the little plateau 
above the falls, a spot where the 
goats liked to go to graze, maybe 
for the taste of the grass, more like- 
ly for pure contrariness. 

The animals were there but they 
were behaving very oddly, clus- 
tered around the billy in an uneasy 
little knot at the top of thi^path 
leading down to the farm, seem- 
ing reluctant either to stay or go. 
Something had frightened them. 

She called them once, then a sec- 
ond time, and made encouraging

noises before they consented to 
enter the narrow pathway, then 
they crowded after her, mincing 
on their hooves as if trying to tip- 
toe. It was only when she saw the 
dead nanny that she knew there had 
been a casualty. It lay on its side a 
few meters off the path. She ap- 
proached it cautiously and saw 
with revulsion that its belly had 
been torn open. Something pro- 
truded from it, something that 
was moving. She backed off a few 
steps, then turned and ran with the 
goats clattering after her. Half- 
way home she slowed to a jog. 
Once, looking back over her 
shoulder, she tripped and fell, 
scrambled up and trotted on. 
What she had to tell was impor- 
tant. “Mother,” she shouted as 
she burst through the open door of 
her home. 

In that moment the sheltered, 
happy life that was all she had ever 
known came to an end. Her fa- 
ther’s body lay in convulsed rigid- 
ity just inside the doorway — her 
mother’s across the table on which 
the last of the breakfast things 
were still scattered. There were 
two hornets. They were feeding. 

Amanda stood unmoving and si- 
lent and did not know that she bit 
one hand to draw blood. She did 
not approach the bodies. In- 
stead, after a minute, she turned 
slowly and left the house. 



Left to their own resources and 
with the gate wide open, the goats 
had invaded the kitchen garden 
and were fast forgetting their 
recent fright. At the foot of the gar- 
den a narrow road, no more than a 
track for farm machinery, ran 
east and west. Either direction 
would have brought her to the 
homes of friends. She crossed it un- 
seeing and walked through humpy 
meadowland, a wavering course 
toward na. destination. She shed 
no tears and made no sound and 
stared vacantly ahead.

and other minor markings on 
his clothing set him apart from his 
civilian colleagues. He was in 
nominal command of the fourth 
team to be set down. He consid- 
ered himself to be tougher, abler 
and much more practical than 
any civilian specialist and, out- 
side of a small coterie, he was 
mildly disliked by most of his 
shipmates. 

The men clambered out of the 
hatch of the landing craft, watched 
it lift and disappear over the hor- 
izon and looked around at the 
empty landscape. The rising slope 
on which they stood was grass-cov- 
ered, punctuated with stands of 
something like gorse. In the dis-

tance were several farm buildings 
or the like and there were a few cat- 
tle to be seen, but no human habi- 
tants. The air was good. Garth and 
his team were visiting a settled 
planet where for a good while men 
had coexisted peaceably with the 
native life forms. They could go 
relatively unencumbered, wear- 
ing fatigues and carrying mini- 
mal weaponry — rifles and lasers, 
a half-dozen apiece of light gre- 
nades. It wasn’t like an initial ex- 
ploration, where you could al- 
most bet on the unexpected. 

“Okay,” Garth announced. 
“Here’s what we’re going to do. 
We’re looking for bugs and they 
probably sting something fierce, 
so watch yourselves. Get your 
headnets on and keep them on — 
and your gloves, too. If you do get 
stung Beale will have shots of atro- 
pine and oxime in his aid kit. Mat- 
tison will carry the collecting 
cages and you other two will be 
ready with the nets. Now we’re go- 
ing to spread out into a line and 
walk toward those low cliffs over 
there. Anybody sees anything like 
a bug lets out a yell.” 

Mattison,. the team’s zoologist, 
said, “Be nice if we had some idea 
what we were looking for. They 
said a plague of hornets, which 
suggests that they fly in swarms. If 
we see any at all we may see a lot of 
them.” 



Armed thus with misconcep- 
tions, they formed a ragged line 
and started toward the cliffs. 

Rossberg was a botanist by 
training and by enthusiasm for 
any and all extraterrestrial 
plants. Even so, the gorselike 
growths seemed not very exciting 
and he was willing to put off a 
close examination of them. When, 
however, he glimpsed what was 
surely a bloom of fruiting body, 
spectacularly red against the 
dark green foliage, he yielded to 
temptation and made off on a 
diagonal to investigate. Up 
close, it seemed not to be a part of 
the gorse after all, but to be stand- 
ing alone on the top of a thick 
stem. He was actually bending 
over it when it struck. 

The fabric of his fatigues was 
designed to resist rain, wind, mil- 
dew, snags and other natural phe- 
nomena, but it was far from being 
body armor and it offered no re- 
sistance to the thrust of the chitin- 
ous stiletto. The sting penetrated 
deep into his side. Rossberg 
shrieked once as he fell, before the 
toxin reached and sealed his 
throat. 

He was dead when the others 
reached him. At least he did not 
breathe and Beale, the paramedic, 
found no pulse in his neck. He was 
lying on his side in such a fashion 
as to hide the hornet. They had to

IF 




roll him over before they saw it. 
Garth felt disgust but for the mo- 
ment no fear as he tore the thing 
violently and quite uselessly 
from Rossberg’s body. The pro- 
boscis pulled out easily. The hooks 
at the ends of the arms or legs or 
whatever you called them clung 
tenaciously and, when they tore 
free, waved frantically in the air. 
Garth stared for a second at the 
pulsating body, then threw it 
from him awkwardly. It landed not 
faraway, scrambled like a head- 
less chicken, got up onto its sinewy, 
jointed legs, then toppled and lay 
still. Its body was leaking fluid, 
ruptured where Garth had 
clutched it. 

Corley made a sound that was 
something like a laugh, then hur- 
riedly snatched away his headnet 
and vomited on the ground. 

“Jesus,” said Beale. “Do you 
suppose that’s one of the things 
they sent us to look for?” 

Garth was sweating and he 
stared down at his gloved hands as 
if they bore some contamination, 
but he gathered himself. “Come 
on, Mattison, this is your busi- 
ness. Let’s take a look at it.” 

Except for Corley, who sat hud- 
dled and miserable, they followed 
Garth reluctantly and looked 
down at the hornet. Garth and 
Beale had drawn their lasers, but 
the creature had stopped moving. 



its body collapsing slowly and 
wrinkling like a leaking balloon. 
They stood in numbed silence for 
a minute before Garth, his mouth 
twisted in a grimace, began to 
cut the body into smoking frag- 
ments. 

“That was a damn fool thing to 
do,” said Mattison. “We ought to 
have taken it back to the ship for 
dissection. It may be hard to get 
another one.” 

“Screw your diss’fection,” Garth 
told him. “It killed Rossberg. And 
if these are the bugs there’ll be oth- 
ers.” 

Mattison was still angered at the 
destruction of a specimen. 
“You’ve probably used up better 
than a quarter of your charge. La- 
sers are meant for defense in an 
emergency.” 

“Shove it,” said the lieutenant, 
who knew he was in the wrong and 
didn’t propose to hear any more 
about it from Mattison. “Now 
here’s what we’re going to do. I’m 
going to leave the radio on beep, 
here beside Rossberg, but we’re 
not going to get far away and 
we’re going to stay close to- 
gether.” 

“There’s another of them,” 
Beale said, pointing. “Two more. 
Hey, Corley, better get up on 
your feet. My God, look how those 
things jump. How do you go about 
shooting something like that?” 



THE HORNETS OF VALORA

¥ N PLACE of an answer, Garth 
^ shot one. He was a first-class 
marksman and instinctively pre- 
ferred to use the longer range rifle. 
“Got the bastard.” 

“But there are four of them now, 
not five, all downhill from us. 
Coming this way.” 

There were more shots, some 
successful. The hornets made 
fair targets in the brief intervals 
between leaps. By squeezing off 
bursts of several shots the men 
could compensate for lack of ac- 
curacy. But hornets continued to 
appear, coming out from beyond 
a low hillock and progressing up- 
grade in a series of irregular 
jumps that seemed clumsy and un- 
certain — as if the jumpers were 
totally mindless — but closed the 
distance to their prey with terri- 
fying rapidity. 

With no intent to give ground, 
each man stepped back a pace or 
two after every shot. Corley first, 
then the others, began a sort of 
organized retreat— fire, turn, 
run and scramble a few meters, 
turn and fire again. There were 
now twenty or thirty hornets in 
sight. Presently there was no 
more pretense of organization. 
They simply ran, while the hor- 
nets inexorably closed the gap. 
The flight came to an end at the 
face of the cliffs, which might have 
been scalable if the men had been 



sufficiently expert olimbers and 
had had the right equipment and 
time to explore. Without these 
advantages they could only stand 
and kill or be killed. 

Corley and Beale died quickly 
because they mistakenly tried to 
use their rifles even after they 
were partly surrounded. Garth 
and Mattison fell back on laser 
pistols with which they could slash 
across the huddle of attackers — 
and after a time there could be no 
doubt that they had won the skir- 
mish. The last few hornets in sight 
were far down the hill and seemed 
not to detect the humans’ pres- 
ence. At least they were not ap- 
proaching. 

Mattison stumbled the few steps 
toward the spot where the bodies 
lay nearly side by side and auto- 
matically exterminated a still 
moving hornet. “Three of us,” he 
said. “Three of us gone. My God.” 
Tears were running down his face. 

Garth stared at him angrily. 
“We’ll take the guns and lasers. 
Come on.’^ 

“Where to?” 

“Maybe we can find a way up 
the cliff. It ought to be safer up 
there.” 

They found no route to the top of 
the cliffs. They did, after some fif- 
teen minutes of walking, come 
upon a shelter of sorts, a three-sid- 
ed structure of planks and logs.

IF 




evidently designed to shelter 
cattle in bad weather. It offered 
shielding and would allow them 
to concentrate on defending the 
one open side that faced downhill 
and toward the distant farm. 
There were no hornets to be seen. 

They laid down their burden of 
weapons. Garth squatted and ar- 
ranged them in a row. There was 
plenty of ammunition for the ri- 
fles, but one of the lasers was com- 
pletely discharged and the best of 
the others showed no more than 
half a charge. He grunted. 

*‘Know how long we’ve been 
down here? Close to two hours. 
Three to go before we get picked 
up. Maybe more. I don’t know 
how long the day is here, but look- 
ing at the sun I’d say it’d be dark 
long before then. The LC will 
come down by the beeper — then 
we’ll have to use flares to show 
them where we are.” 

Mattison sat down on the 
packed dirt floor. “Let me see the 
binoculars a minute.” He swept 
them back and forth across the val- 
ley. “We must have been put down 
close to a colony of the things. 
There aren’t as many as we might 
have thought, but I can see a few. I 
suspect they’re thermotropic.” 
“Thermotropic?” 

“That means they detect and are 
attracted by our body heat. I 
didn’t get a good look, but my im- 



pression is that they have nothing 
like eyes. That doesn’t mean they 
couldn’t perceive light. They may 
act differently at night. If it’s 
cooler after dark we may stand 
out more from the general ther- 
mal background and they’ll de- 
tect us from a greater distance.” 
“You’re a big help. Take a look 
over there. I think somebody is 
coming. He’s just coming out 
from behind that little hill.” 

Mattison used the glasses. “It’s 
not a he — it’s a she. Looks from 
here like a young girl.” 

They watched in silence for a 
time as she approached. Her path 
was erratic, sometimes nearly 
doubling back, but she was mak- 
ing slow progress up the hill. 

“Look,” Mattison said. “She’s 
going to come pretty close to 
where those two hornets are.” 
“Yeah. What’s the matter with 
the girl? Is she blind?” 

“Don’t know. Listen, I’m going 
down to get her. Keep me cov- 
ered.” He rose to his feet, seized a 
laser and set off at as rapid a pace 
as, possible. Garth dropped to 
prone position, shouldered a rifle 
and fixed the sights on the nearer 
hornet. It was standing motion- 
less. The second made a leap that 
brought it closer to Mattison’s 
path. He saw and circled away 
from it, but kept going. Mattison 
was showing more stuff than

Garth had credited him with. 



A manda looked vacantly at 
the man who had grasped her 
arm. She tried to pull away, but the 
grip tightened. He was speaking 
to her, trying to tell her some- 
thing. She made another half- 
hearted attempt to go away from 
him, but he wouldn’t let her go. 
Finally she went in the direction 
he was taking her. He was mak- 
ing her hurry. 

Amanda was not aware of fa- 
tigue or pain. She had fallen of- 
ten. Her hands and knees were 
bruised and cut, her face was 
streaked with dirt. One shoe was 
gone. She did not know the disas- 
ter that had fallen upon her — that 
she was fleeing from an intolera- 
ble horror. She did not even know 
that she was Amanda Comfort. 
Her state of shock was still merci- 
ful to her. There was a sudden 
sharp noise. On that nearly weap- 
onless world she did not recognize 
it as a rifle shot. But off to one side 
something was bouncing and 
flopping around, something red. 
She looked at it and screamed, the 
first sound she had made since 
leaving her own front door. The 
mart held her hard and made her 
run. 

“Nice shooting,” Mattison said. 
“Thanks. They don’t seem to have 



any sense of sight or hearing. The 
one never moved when you got the 
other.” 

“You’re welcome,” Garth an- 
swered inanely. “One more hop 
and he’d have reached you. What’s 
the matter with her?” 

“Nothing obvious, physically 
that is. I think she’s in a state of 
shock and one foot is gashed. She’s 
been leaving bloody footprints. 
Sit down, baby, and let me look at 
that foot. Yes, we’d better get 
some antiseptic and a bandage 
on it.” 

“We haven’t got the aid kit. We 
left it with Beale. With Beale’s 
body, I mean.” 

“I’ll get it,” Mattison said. 

“No, I’ll go. Maybe I can make 
it a little faster. You’d better stay 
with the girl.” 

They turned and looked at 
Amanda, who was sitting with 
one leg still extended — as she had 
been left. 

“Poor kid,” said Garth. “Yeah, 
you stay. I’m going to take this 
laser — it has the most charge. You 
didn’t know it, but the one you 
grabbed up was empty.’’ 

Mattison looked faintly sick. 
“My God — I thought I had a 
weapon in my hand. I’m glad I 
didn’t know.” 

The fact that Mattison had gone 
for the girl and was willing to get 
the aid kit made it quite essential 



94 



IF 




for Garth to go» to sustain his be- 
lief that as a military man he was 
automatically the better quali- 
fied. He felt like a military man 
until he was within sight of the 
bodies. 

There were no living hornets, 
but the site had clearly been visit- 
ed in the interval. Beale and Cor- 
ley were not as they had been. 
Their clothing now lay flat to the 
ground, looking quite empty. 
Garth could see the aid kit flung a 
little distance from Beale’s body 
and he wanted very much not to 
approach those empty garments. 
He stood for a minute or two lean- 
ing against an outcrop of rock 
while sweat trickled down his fore- 
head and stung one eye, before he 
could takd the remaining steps. 
He tried not to look down at the 
tattered clothing and the taut 
mummy skull that still remained 
of Beale, but he could not avoid 
seeing. 

He went most of the way back to 
the cattle shelter at a jog and only 
stopped and rested because he 
must not arrive out of breath. 

Mattison shook his head in an- 
swer to Garth’s look of inquiry. 
“Nothing. There are a few hor- 
nets out there beyond where we 
picked her up, but they’re not com- 
ing this way. Just moving around 
aimlessly.” 

“How’s the youngster doing?” 



“Some better, I think. Her eyes 
have followed me whenever I 
moved around. Let’s take care of 
the foot.” 

A manda winced at the prob- 
ing of the cut and the bite of 
the antiseptic and seemed to look 
on with a beginning of understand- 
ing as they applied bandages and 
sprayed on a layer of plastic heavy 
enough to be walked on. 

When they had finished Garth 
turned away and stared across the 
valley. The sun was just touching 
the horizon in the direction the 
settled planets call the west. 

“Going to be dark soon.” 

“How many flares have we?” 
Mattison asked. 

Garth patted his hip. “Four. 
About twenty minutes’ worth.” 
Mattison said, “I suggest we 
throw the first one as far as we can 
and see what happens. If those 
devils are thermotropic they may 
be phototropic as well, with or 
without eyes.” 

“Attracted by light?” 

“Yes. We don’t want dozens of 
them descending on us.” 

“I’ll say we don’t. We’ll do bet- 
ter than throw it. I’ll go off a hun- 
dred meters or so, light it and run 
back. That sun’s going down aw- 
ful fast. Well, hello.” 

Amanda had risen and was 
standing between the two men. 



THE HORNETS OF VALORA 




Tears coursed down her face, but 
she made no sound. Mattison put 
an arm around her shoulders and 
squeezed. 

“Let it out, baby. Let it out.” 

She turned, buried her face on 
his shoulder and blubbered, 
clutching his shirt with desperate 
fingers. When at length her sobs 
subsided, Mattison said, “You’d 
better tell us about it. What hap- 
pened, baby?” 

After a couple of tries she found 
her voice. “They killed my father 
and mother.” 

“The hornets?” 

“Those things. They killed fa- 
ther and mother. Oh, God. What 
will I do? What will I ever do? The 
things killed them and they 
were — ” She broke into renewed 
sobbing. 

“What’s your name?” 

“What?” 

“Tell us what your name is.” 

“Oh. Amanda.” 

“Do you have any friends near- 
by?” 

“Any friends? Yes, Polly. She’s 
my best friend. Can you take me* 
there?” 

“Sure we can,” Garth said gruff- 
ly. “We’ll take you there in a ship, 
but we’ve got to wait for the ship to 
come. A ship like a big flier. Can 
you understand?” 

“Of course.” 

The farm buildings were still vis- 



ible in the gathering twilight. 
Amanda pointed. “That’s where I 
live, over there — and Polly lives 
on up that way. It isn’t very far. 
That’s where I used to live,” she 
amended, loaking at her home 
once more. She began to cry 
again. 

Garth stared at her helplessly. 
“Sit down here beside us, kid, and 
help watch for the ship.” He found 
her a handkerchief. 

Hesitantly, as if the action were 
somehow a denial of her grief, she 
hunkered down. “They’ll have 
lights,” said Mattison. “Red, 
white and green lights.” 

Amanda was silent then, lost in 
her own unhappy thoughts. 
When, after not too long a time, 
the LC did show its lights in the 
distance, the men by unspoken 
consent let her be first to make the 
discovery. Garth rose. 

“They’re way ahead of schedule. 
That’s good. It’s not yet pitch 
dark.” He pulled a flare out of 
his pack. “Do you see that big rock 
down there? That’s where I’ll drop 
this.” 

He strode off with the flare and a 
laser. 

“What’s he doing?” Amanda 
asked. “Where’s he going?” 

“Don’t worry. He’s going to 
make a bright light so the ship can 
come for us. They don’t know just 
where we are.”

G arth stood for a minute by 
the rock and watched the slow- 
ly descending LC. They saw him 
toss the candle and start back to- 
ward the shelter. Mattison turned 
his head to watch for any activity 
around the ship. When he looked 
back he could no longer see Garth 
in the growing dark. Then the flare 
erupted into dazzling blue bril- 
liance and Garth was silhouetted 
halfway back to the shelter. He 
was crawling in an awkward, spi- 
dery fashion. When Mattison 
reached him he was unable to stand 
and had to be dragged to his feet 
and half carried. 

He was trying to talk but his 
speech was so thick and slurred as 
to be nearly ununderstandable. 
He clutched one wrist. 

“One ’em got me. Ri’ through 
han’. Tourni — tourniquet.” He 
made incoherent sounds as Mat- 
tison lowered him to the ground, 
but nothing with any meaning. 
The light from the flare cast black 
shadows but Mattison could see 
the puncture on the back of 
Garth’s hand. He clamped a grip 
on the already swollen wrist. 

“You. Amanda,” he command- 
ed. “Bring me the aid kit. That 
thing there. Open it.” He dumped 
the contents on the ground, locat- 
ed a tourniquet and without re- 
laxing his hold was able to wrap it 
firmly about the wrist. Then for 

THE HORNETS OF VALOR A 



good measure he rolled up Garth’s 
sleeve and applied another above 
the elbow. From the container of 
syrettes he selected one marked 
atropine: neurotoxins, and 
pressed it against the exposed 
forearm. 

There was nothing more he 
could do. Garth was silent now 
and his eyes were closed, but he 
shivered violently at intervals 
and was apparently conscious. 
Without being asked, Amanda 
cradled his head in her lap and 
held to his shoulders to restrain 
more violent movements. 

Mattison turned to look out. The 
flare was blazing silently, but 
ringed around it now were scores of 
hornets. They stood motionless, 
crowded against one another at a 
distance of only four or five me- 
ters from the source of light. So 
they were phototropic but with a 
limit. They could not or would not 
approach too closely. 

A flare was good for five min- 
utes — this one had to be at least 
half spent. Within seconds of its 
going out, he thought, he. Garth 
and the girl would be over- 
whelmed by a wave of hornets. He 
bent, rolled Garth as gently as he 
could to one side and retrieved the 
other flares. Then he waited. 
When the first flare flickered out 
his, light-struck eyes were for a mo- 
ment unable to see anything at

all, but he lit the fuse of the second 
one by feel and threw it. The de- 
vice was nicely weighted and car- 
ried for nearly thirty meters. 
That was perilously close, but it 
was the best he could do. 

The new burst of light was 
dazzling. He kept his eyes on the 
ground for as long as he dared, 
then picked up the nearest rifle. 
The new ring of hornets was al- 
ready forming. “Don’t be scared, 
Amanda,” he told the girl. 
“You’re a brave young lady.” 

The hornets, slaves to their trop- 
isms, paid no attenti/)n to the 
nearby humans and simply 
crowded into a densely packed 
circle. He had waited long enough 
and, with the rifle set on automat- 
ic, he swept the swarm with deva- 
stating fire. When the gun was 
empty there were still a few stand- 
ing hornets, a few more ap- 
proaching from the outer dark- 
ness. He changed guns and picked 
them off in short bursts. 

He didn’t see the LC until it was 
hovering squarely in front of 
them, actually between him and 
the recent targets. Then there 
were people to boost Amanda 
aboard, to carry and lift Garth, to 
give him a hand up. 

¥T WAS a full week before Mat- 
-^tison was told that he might visit 
Lieutenant Garth in sick bay. 



Garth was propped up in bed, look- 
ing pale but tolerably well other- 
wise. 

“Hello, Mattie, you old son of a 
bitch,” was Garth’s greeting. It 
was clearly an accolade, a wel- 
come to the elite. 

“Hi,” said Mattison. “How you 
feeling?” 

“Still shaggy.” Garth waved a 
lightly bandaged hand. “I must 
have gotten a pretty small dose or 
I’d have been dead quick — but it 
wasn’t good when you were lug- 
ging me up that hill, I tell you. You 
know what those bastardly hor- 
nets do? After they’ve tied up your 
nerves into red-hot knots they dis- 
solve your blood cells. First day I 
haven’t gotten a transfusion. 
How are things on Valora? You 
did real good down there, by the 
way.” 

“How much do you know?” 

“Not much. The damn doc 
thinks you should never tell a pa- 
tient anything. I know we’ve been 
in and out of warp because it al- 
ways makes me dizzy. That’s all.” 

“We’ve been in and out four 
times. We made a round trip to 
Glenmaurie and they’re sending 
all sorts of supplies — small arms 
and high intensity lights mostly. 
The lights do a job. You can at- 
tract and paralyze all the hornets 
in a neighborhood as fast as they 
can get there. We’ve given Valora

IF 




practically all our own flares for 
the present and their broadcast 
centers are all putting out in- 
structions. Things will be under 
control soon in all the populated 
parts of the planet.” 

“Good,” Garth said, “good.” 
He ruminated. “Were there other 
losses besides ours?” 

“One. Lin Chang. We got the 
worst of it. The other teams all had 
some warning of what to expect.” 
“Tough on Chang. He was a 
good man. So were our guys, of 
course. I didn’t know them so well. 
How’s the girl? Amanda.” 

“She’s here on thfe ship. She’d 
like to see you.” 

“Would she, now. Well I’d like 



to see her. She’s a damn good kid. 
How come she’s on the ship? It’s 
against rules.” 

“Captain waived the rule until 
she could be delivered some- 
where safe. That’ll happen to- 
morrow. She has a courtesy aunt 
and uncle. Polly’s parents, the 
Brennans. I’ve talked to them. It’s 
a nice family and they’ll take good 
care of her. This week has helped 
her. New environment and all. 
The captain has posted our next 
assignment. Carson II.” 

“Never heard of it. Hope it’s not 
civilized like Valora.” 

“No people, no hornets. Any- 
thing else, maybe, but no hornets. 
That’s guaranteed.” •

LEE KILLOUGH 



The ultimate IQ test 
for an alien may be 
this: by what method 
does he destroy you? 

C IAN reflected ruefully that he 
might as well have saved time 
by immolating himself prior to the 
hearing. The six pairs of eyes 
around the table were regarding him 
with all the critical deliberation of 
pathologists debating where to begin 
a dissection. He sat down in a 
vacant chair at the narrow foot of 
the long table, trying to stifle the 
uneasiness that bushed out his sil- 
very pelt, and stared back with 
violet eyes he hoped appeared calm. 
It was vital he seem objective and 
unemotional. The lives of the shree 
depended on it. 

A Brisian at the apex of the table 
shifted position, his carapace grating 
loudly against his chair. “The char- 
ter board has been called to review 
the sentient-species claim filed by 
Dr. Buurn Cian. We have one auxil- 
iary member, attorney Saud bin 
Saal, who is here representing the 
Megeyn Corporation.” He nodded at 
a swarthy Catheze sitting to his left. 



Bin Saal inclined his head toward 
the board chairman. “I wish to 
thank you for asking me to sit with 
you, sar. The mining operations on 
Nira represent a considerable invest- 
ment by my company. Naturally 
any action threatening our charter is 
of great concern to us.” His gaze 
switched abruptly to Cian, a scalpel 
gaze as keen as the edge to his 
voice. “We’ve not met before but I 
know you by reputation, doctor. 
You’re advancing. A sentience peti- 
tion is a step up from your previous 
efforts.” 

Cian stiffened. 

“I beg your pardon?” the chair- 
man said. 

The attorney’s eyes never left 
Cian. ‘The doctor is becoming a 
veteran of these hearings. His first 
petition was on Naan-taen— on behalf 
of a species called quaere. After 
transfer to Jornava he became em- 
broiled in an effort to preserve the 
jebbijy bird. In the first case he was 
successful. As a result the predator 
slaughtered some twenty percent of 
the colonists before a permissible 
form of defense was devised. For- 
tunately he was overruled in the 
second case and the colonists on 
Jornava were spared decimation.” 

“Instead, a unique species is vir- 
tuaUy extinct,” Cian said bitterly. 

He bit his tongue in self-reproach 
as the attorney smiled thinly. Bin 
Saal wanted to goad him into ex- 



SENTIENCE 



103 




pressing his feelings in just such 
emotional statements. 

“Not that I blame you for your 
Preservationist leanings, doctor. Af- 
ter all you are a physician, dedicat- 
ed by profession to saving life. Even 
more pertinently, you are a R’rae- 
than. Your people’s obsession for 
conserving life— all forms— is well 
known throughout the Federation. 
As hostile as your planet’s environ- 
ment is, you could hardly have 
evolved any other way. But I won- 
der, if such a viewpoint might pre- 
vent you from considering such 
matters as sentience and non-sen- 
tience with proper objectivity.” 
Now Bin Saal addressed the chair- 
man. “Here’s what I find interest- 
ing. When the operations adminis- 
trator on Nira decides to declare the 
shree a dangerous predator, the doc- 
tor suddenly discovers they are in- 
telligent and rushes to file his claim 
first.” 

“Nothing sudden about it,” Cian 
retorted. “I’ve been convinced of 
their intelligence since running into 
them on Nira fourteen standard 
months ago.” 

“But you said nothing until 
now.” The chairman frowaed. 

Cian nodded. “Conviction isn’t 
proof. Although I’ve studied sen- 
tience extensively during the past 
year, it isn’t my field of expertise. I 
couldn’t come to you with only an 
amateur’s personal opinion.” 



“How fortunate you found your 
proof }ust in time to supercede 
Rom Lekir’s petition,” the attorney 
remarked. 

For an instant Cian wished he 
were back among the wildernesses 
of Naar. But most likely the Federa- 
tion would order him assigned else- 
where, now that he had crossed the 
light-years to Planet Base. Determi- 
nation filled him anew. Federation 
law held that all sentient beings— 
whether mammalian, reptilian or 
anything else— were people, and 
therefore not to be warred upon. 
Cian meant to uphold that law. 

“I have documented evidence—” 
he began, then broke off. His voice 
was much louder and sharper than 
he had intended. 

The chairman interceded firmly. 
“Gentlemen, let’s proceed in more 
orderly fashion. Certainly the doc- 
tor is well acquainted with the 
species in question. And no doubt 
sar Bin Saal knows something of 
them, too. But this board does not. 
If we’re to judge the matter intelli- 
gently we will need more back- 
ground and fewer accusations. After 
all, the doctor is not on trial here— 
only his petition.” The chairman 
pressed a button set into the edge 
of the table. “I have invited the 
survey agent who classified these 
life forms during the charter in- 
spection twelve years ago. We will 
begin with him.” 



104 



IF 




T he being who entered was a 
Geolon— a thin, hairless and yel- 
low-skinned man still resembling his 
primeval lizard ancestors. He folded 
into an empty chair, laying a few 
cinecorder cassettes on the table, 
and turned his yellow eyes on the 
chairman. Cian shifted uneasily. The 
Geolon exuded scrupulous effi- 
ciency. 

“You are Inspector Zarith 
Than?” the chairman asked. 

The survey agent nodded. 

“Would you briefly explain the 
duties of a charter inspection 
team?” 

“Certainly. We remain on the 
planet under observation for four 
years to study it in all seasons. We 
test exhaustively to be certain noth- 
ing the proposed colony will use, 
either mechanical or chemical, is 
harmful to local life. We recom- 
mend charter restrictions to prevent 
pollution of the planet. We also 
attemipt to identify which plants 
and animals are most likely to pre- 
sent a danger to the colonists.” 

“Do you determine if the planet 
has an intelligent species?” an arth- 
ropodal board member asked. 

“Our first and foremost task.” 
The arthropod’s eyestalks waved 
slowly between Cian and the survey 
agent. “Whose particular respon- 
sibility was that on Nira?” 

“Mine.” 

“You are acquainted, then, with 



the shree named in the petition?” 
the chairman queried. 

“Indeed. I found them fascinating 
creatures.” 

“Creatures, not people?” the at- 
torney exclaimed. “Dr. Cian claims 
to have proof they’re intelligent.” 

“Not having seen his evidence, I 
can hardly pass judgment on it. But 
I examined the shree to the best of 
my ability and found no intelli- 
gence,” the survey agent stated. 

“On what do you base your 
professional competence?” a feline- 
looking board member asked. 

“I hold degrees in biology, panan- 
thropology and psychology. I also 
have specialized training in sentience 
evolution.” 

“Tell us something about these 
shree,” the chairman suggested. 

“Certainly. I’ve brought with me 
the tapes made at the time of the 
inspection. Watch the screen, 
please.” 

He picked out a cassette from the 
stack, pushed it into a slot at the 
base of the large translucent cube in 
the middle of the table. Something 
hummed, and a moment later a 
picture appeared on each side of the 
cube. 

At first there was only blue sky 
with a small, dark form flying high 
in it, too far away to distinguish 
color or shape. Then magnification 
was stepped up and the creature 
filled the screen. Cian studied the 



SENTIENCE 



105 




familiar form, trying to see it as the 
board members would. It was finely 
boned ju4ging by its long thin 
limbs, but thickly corded muscles 
bulged across Jts shoulders and 
back. Fur, short and velvety as 
Cian’s but brown in color, covered 
the entire body except the- wide 
membranous wings. Those spread up 
and out from the shoulders and 
down to the feet. As the creature 
glided it turned and the cinecorder 
recorded a good view of a flat- 
muzzled face. The ears were small, 
high-set and round, the eyes wide 
and dark. It carried its forelegs 
folded comfortably across its chest, 
the three toes and opposable thumb 
on each paw loosely interlaced. 

Cian frowned. The eyes were 
wrong. They were bright and alert 
but somehow lacking. He had 
known instantly, looking into the 
eyes of his first shree, that there 
was a mind behind it; he had felt it 
with a still-remembered shock of 
recognition . 

“There’s your shree,” the survey 
agent said, “We named it that after 
their distinctive call. This one is a 
mature male of average size, be- 
tween 100 and 125 centimeters 
long.” 

“How can you tell it’s male?” a 
blue-skinned Minoran asked. 

“It isn’t easy to determine except 
by color. Males are shaded from 
brown to black; females, bronze to 



near gold. The cubs are dappled 
until they reach maturity at about 
five years.” 

The picture changed to a rough 
cliff face pocked by slits and holes 
and terraced with ledges. On several 
of the ledges shree of various sizes 
and colors lay sunning themselves, 
wings folded across their backs like 
capes. Their feet were no longer 
connected to their wings. A hook- 
like spur on each heel provided for 
in-flight attachment. 

“I apologize for the poor detail 
of the shot,” the survey agent said. 
“It had to be taken at long range.” 

“They were vicious?” the arthro- 
pod asked. 

^‘Only if their dens or hunting 
kill were approached. Otherwise 
they were cautiously friendly. We 
seemed to fascinate them. The male 
you saw a moment ago spent almost 
an hour circling above me. Once he 
flew to within a few meters. Doc- 
tor?” he asked as Cian moved sharp- 
ly* 

Cian shook his head. “Never 
mind.” With keen regret he reflected 
on how drastically the shree had 
changed. 

T he survey agent returned to his 
tape. “These you see now are 
part of a single band.' the two 
males on the ledge at the far left 
are young bachelors. Having reached 
maturity they have been forced to 



106 



IF 




leave the home den. But the older 
males with bands seem willing to 
tolerate bachelors living nearby, 
even let them join in the hunting so 
long as the bachelors ignore the 
females. Otherwise they are either 
driven out of the band’s territory or 
must fight to replace one of the 
established males. Shree are strongly 
territorial, though their grounds are 
so huge that they frequently ignore 
nomads living solitary lives near the 
borders.” 

“Interesting,” murmured the 
chairman. “Are the bands large?” 

“Shree bands are made up of 
several patriarch males who share 
some eight to twelve females. I saw 
small bands with two males and one 
large band with five, but most have 
three patriarchs. Every day two of 
the males hunt for food, taking 
along older cubs, neighbor bache- 
lors, and the younger, stronger fe- 
males. One male always remains at 
the den with the females who are 
looking after the cubs. The young 
are born in the spring in single and 
twin births, usually twin, and nursed 
until the next cubs are bom. A 
female who happens to be barren 
one year— and females . are unac- 
countably out of heat for as long as 
four consecutive years— will suckle 
her own cubs and others’ for a 
second year. They appear to be 
fond parents. Even the males play 
with the cubs and let them take 



what seemed to me to be extreme 
liberties.” 

“A rather advanced social struc- 
ture,” the feline board member 
commented. 

“Sophisticated, in fact. Do you 
consider that suggestive, inspector?” 
Cian asked. 

The survey agent’s bare scalp 
wrinkled. “Not really. Many ani- 
mals, even those of low-order intelli- 
gence, have complex societies.” 

“How, exactly, do you determine 
if a planet has sentient life?” This 
from the Minoran. 

Sitting back in his chair, the 
survey agent tented his fingers. “As- 
suming intelligence is too primitive 
for any life form to be constructing 
villages yet,‘ sentience determination 
is a matter of watching game trails 
and observing the life forms that 
pass. Sentience may be defined as 
conscious perception, integral to in- 
telligence. And intelligence follows a 
predictable pattern. For the most 
part, it appears only in predators, 
and not the biggest or most for- 
midably equipped ones.” His eyes 
shifted, as if in illustration, to a 
board member whose pale slender- 
ness reminded Cian of an old poetic 
line Concerning star-winds and 
moon-songs. “A large powerful ani- 
mal doesn’t need brains; it can exist 
as it is. The predator that develops 
rationality is one with a need for 
something more than teeth and 



SENTIENCE 



107 




claws in order to survive. So I look 
for a creature that dominates its 
territory despite larger killer species 
competing with it.” 

“May I interrupt a moment, in- 
spector?” the lawyer asked. “What 
about very small life forms? Not 
that it’s the case here, but how can 
you be certain you aren’t overlook- 
ing a species that would not use the 
game trail-a species perhaps micro- 
scopic in size?” 

The survey agent smiled. “With- 
out a brain of certain minimum size 
there is no intelligence. Something 
we cannot see readily is too^far 
below the critical minimum to be 
concerned with.” He glanced around 
the table but there were no more 
questions. He went on: “I look for 
a species with grasping limbs of 
some type— hands, tentacles or 
claws.” He nodded at the arthro- 
pod. “A race must be able to use 
tools if it is to evolve.” 

“The shree use tools,” Cian put 
in. 

“To be precise, a tool.” The 
survey agent leaned forward and 
removed the cassette from the view- 
er. After a minute of sorting 
through the other cassettes he 
found the one he wanted, slipped it 
into the slot. 

As the picture came on, a human- 
oid hand placed something on a blue 
cloth background. The cinecorder 
moved in almost on top of 



the object. It was a short section of 
woody stalk with five long thorns 
set at regular intervals along one 
side. The thorns were triangular— a 
point and three sharp edges. 

“Daggerthorns,” Cian said. 

HE survey agent nodded. “Each 
-*• thorn is nearly eight centi- 
meters long. They grow on one side 
of the stalk. A ring of the stalks 
surrounds the large central stem 
that supports the seed pod. The pod 
is edible and nutritious, but few 
species except birds and shree try to 
get at it because of the protective 
thorns. The shree break the stalks 
into sections and hold them so the 
thorns project between and on 
either side of the shree’s closed 
fingers. Thus they get at the pods, 
and at the same time provide them- 
selves with weapons. Their own 
claws are sharp but short— not near- 
ly as efficient as the thorns for 
bringing down bolkis, their chief 
source of meat.” 

He tapped a switch beneath the 
cassette slot on the viewer. The 
picture blurred as the tape speeded 
up. When it slowed to normal view- 
ing rate the scene had changed and 
was obviously being recorded at long 
range from a hopper. 

Ill the canyon below, a herd of 
tawny ungulates was stampeding 
wildly. The dust stirred up by their 
hoofs obscured details but Cian 



108 



IF 




picked out the blocky winged forms 
of shree flying above the ungulates. 

‘This is a typical hunting party,” 
the survey agent said. “I counted 
twelve members. They work in 

teams of three, diving at the bolki 
and slashing the animal’s hide on 
each pass. The daggerthorns serve 
this purpose well. Eventually the 
animal is exhausted by running and 
weak from loss of blood. When it 
falls, one of the team will cut its 
throat. Shree are strong for their 

size. Three can pick up one of those 
browsers and fly it back \o their 
den with little effort.” 

A bolki stumbled and a black 
form dropped on it. The beast 

struggled briefly, its four supporting 
limbs and the small grasping limb 
on each side of its neck flailing in 
final desperation. Then the bolki 

went limp. Two gold shree landed 
beside it. They took the bolki’s legs 
while the black shree lifted the 
bloodied head. Wings beating in 
unison, the three rose into the air 
with their kill and carried it away. 

“I debated categorizing them as 
‘questionable’ because of their dag- 
gerthorn tool. But I had to decide 
against them.” 

“Why?” Cian protested. “What 
else but intelligence explains their 
use of the daggerthorn?” 

The survey agent regarded him 
patiently. “Accident. They got on 
to the technique fortuitously. May- 



be one was after a daggerthorn pod 
and happened to be holding a stalk 
when a bolki charged. The shree 
started to claw in defense, forget- 
ting the stalk in its paw. The bolki 
was blinded or driven off. Whatever, 
the shree found that daggerthorns 
are better than claws and used a 
piece of stalk when he hunted after 
that. Others in his band copied. 
Bachelors moving into other bands 
from the first one spread the idea.” 

The feline board member said, 
“On my world, the plaa dangle a 
leafy stick above the water. That 
lures fish into the shallows for 
easier catching.” 

“So many animals use crude 
types of tools! We can consider 
such use only a possible indication of 
intelligence, not proof.” 

Cian swallowed a bark of exas- 
peration. “What does constitute 
proof?” 

The survey officer’s scalp furrow- 
ed. “Language, certainly, and con- 
struction. Unfortunately we know 
that primitive species exist which 
are not yet capable of the latter and 
in which the former is still so 
rudimentary as to be hardy recog- 
nizable. In such cases we have to 
depend on behavior to make our 
differentiation. The difficulty is in 
termining what is a result of the 
thinking process and what is merely 
conditioned response. Surprisingly, 
much behavior is merely the result 



SENTIENCE 



109 




of conditioning, in men as well as in 
animals.” The furrows in his bare 
pate deepened. “The only behavior 
we have been able to safely consider 
unique to rational beings is what 
has been variously termed creativity 
or synthesis. It is the ability to take 
two or more unrelated items and 
combine them to produce a useful 
or esthetic result. An animal that 
discovers a useful object or a benefi- 
cial method of performing a task 
will continue to apply that dis- 
covery the same way and no other 
time after time. The shree limit 
their use of the daggerthorn to 
hunting. They don’t appear to re- 
cognize its other possibilities as a 
weapon.” 

Cian leaned forward. “But—” 

The survey agent ignored him. 
“In all the skirmishes I observed 
between patriarchs and invading 
bachelors, fighting was confined to 
teeth and claws. The daggerthorn 
never appeared. An intelligent crea- 
ture will experiment to see what 
else can be done with a method or 
object. Because of their failure to 
do this, I classified the shree as 
animals.” 

“But they do use the dagger- 
thorns as weapons,” Cian said. 

The survey agent snapped around 
to face the doctor. “What?” 

“They drop out of the sky on us 
with daggerthorns in both hands. I’ve 
treated hundreds of lacerations in the 



months I’ve been on Nira. Several 
men have even died as a result of 
their injuries. That’s why our opera- 
tions administrator, Lekir, wants 
them declared a dangerous preda- 
tor.” 

“But you are sure, positively, that 
the shree are not,” the attorney said. 

“Predators, yes, of course they 
are— but intelligent ones,” Cian shot 
back. “I was caught in an attack 
not long after I first arrived. One 
shree came within arm’s reach of 
me.” For a moment the hearing 
room disappeared and Cian was in 
the hot, dusty canyon again, staring 
into two livid eyes. “It wasn’t fear or 
mere anger I read in him, sar Bin Saal. 
It was hate— real, passionate, per- 
sonal-directed at me and my kind.” 
The moment of communion had 
ended abruptly as the shree slashed 
down at him. Just before the thorns 
in the creature’s hand reached the 
doctor’s face, someone knocked Cian 
flat. He had felt air ripple the fur on 
his back as the shree’s wings beat the 
space where he had been. 

W ITH a shiver he returned to the 
hearing room, facing Megeyn’s 
attorney again. “There has to be 
intelligence behind that kind of hate. 
Afterward I realized the shree were 
behaving not like mere vicious ani- 
mals but as any beings would who 
were defending their *land from in- 
vaders.”

IF 




“Doctor,” the blue-skinned board 
member said, pursing his lips, “we 
would like to see your evidence of 
the shree’s intelligence.” 

“Of course.” Cian was pleased to 
note his voice sounded matter-of- 
fact, though what, he actually felt 
was profound relief. A short while 
ago he had not been sure they would 
even agree to look at his evidence. He 
reached for the hand file on the floor 
beside his chair and took out a stack 
of papers. 

“I found proof just before I filed 
my claim. It came out of the same 
incident, in fact, that precipitated 
Lekir’s decision. My only regret is 
that two men had to die first.” 

“What men, doctor?” the chair- 
man asked. 

“Two of the miners. Some of us 
were playing scramble ball on the 
plateau outside the camp one free- 
day when a group of shree dived out 
of the clouds at us. We threw our- 
selves on the ground. It’s about the 
only possible defense. Even lasers 
wouldn’t have done much good. 
Shree dive s\\^ftly and zoom off 
before anyone can take aim. We 
stayed flat until we were sure they 
were gone, then started counting 
injuries. Only Morka and Chaasse 
were hurt, and not severely— a few 
superficial scratches on their arms.” 
The chairman nodded. 

“We went on with the game. But 
after a few minutes Morka and 



Chaasse had to quit, complaining they 
couldn’t breathe. I saw they were 
gasping much harder than the activ- 
ity of the game would warrant so I 
took them over to the infirmary. 
Rest didn’t relieve their distress. I 
was puzzled and frightened. In fact, 
I-” 

“Never mind your feelings, doc- 
tor,” the chairman said. “Just tell us 
briefly what happened.” 

“They died. I worked over them 
an hour and a half. I used hyper- 
oxides, I.V., cholenine, the respirator, 
the cardiostimulator— but they still 
died.” He felt again the bitter anger 
at his helplessness. 

“Did you perform autopsies?” 

“Promptly. I don’t like losing pa- 
tients and I wanted to know why it 
had happened. Examination turned 
up no pathology in either man, as I 
expected. I took blood samples and 
dissected out tissue from the spinal 
cords and around the wounds of 
both men. Testing them took three 
days but I found my answer. Here 
are my results.” Cian pushed the 
papers into the middle of the table 
where each board member could 
reach them. “Both miners were poi- 
soned.” 

The survey agent hissed through 
his Teeth. The attorney snatched a 
paper and read it with narrowed 
eyes. - 

“Did you identify the poison?” 
the feline asked. 



SENTIENCE 



111 




“I did. The signs the two men 
exhibited are listed in the colony’s 
medical records. There is a plant we 
call the sweetvine. Crushed, it pro- 
duces a thick symp that can be 
fermented into a potent liquor. The 
crews brewed it by the kiloliter the 
first year, I’ve been told. Then a 
miner happened to spill raw syrup 
into a cut on his hand. The physician 
at the colony recorded that the poor 
fellow died of cardiac and respiratory 
failure within two hours. The miners 
avoid the vines now. Only the shree 
could have introduced the poison 
into the bodies of these two men.” 

The papers were being studied 
carefully. Cian waited a few mo- 
ments before going on. 

“Note the first three columns. 
They are the quantitative and quali- 
tative analyses of the miners’ cord 
tissue, epidermis and blood. Clearly 
the concentration of poison is great- 
est in the dermal tissue. The fourth 
column is an analysis of raw sweet- 
vine juice. It matches exactly the 
substance found in the dead miners. 
And since the concentration was 
greatest around the wounds, I con- 
cluded that daggerthorns carried by 
the shree must have been the poison- 
ing agent.” He paused to let the 
others read, then turned toward the 
survey officer. “I believe,” Cian said, 
“that constitutes an example of crea- 
tivity.” 

“Now, doctor,” the attorney rem- 



onstrated in a smooth, friendly voice. 
“Is it so inconceivable that, as in the 
case of the daggerthorns, the shree 
might have accidentally learned-” 

“Hardly,” the survey agent inter- 
rupted. “I can think of no accident, 
no possible quirk of conditioning 
that could account for learning to 
use poison. The shree, whose diet 
includes sweetvine berries, would' 
have had to observe that one con- 
stituent of the plant could be lethal 
to themselves. Then they would have 
had to determine not only that the 
juice was this lethal constituent but 
that other species could die from it, 
too. Finally, they would have had to 
devise a method of transferring the 
juice to that other species. You’re 
quite right, doctor— it is creativity.” 

The chairman scratched the breast- 
plate of his carapace. “I’m puzzled, 
inspector. How is it possible? Twelve 
years ago you judged them to be 
incapable of any such kind of 
thinking.” 

“I know. I’ve been sitting here 
reviewing the investigation in my 
mind. But I find nothing, even in 
retrospect, that suggests how I could 
have erred.” 

Cian remembered the close-up 
tape of the single shree and com- 
pared it mentally with his memory of 
the shree that had attacked him. “Do 
you suppose—” he began, stopping as 
all eyes turned inquiringly on him. 
“Has the operations adminis- 



112 



IF 




trator been brought here too? To be 
a witness, I mean?” 

The chairman said, “Of course, 
doctor.” 

“May I ask him some questions?” 
“By all means.” The chairman 
pressed the button in front of him. 

HE hawkish witness seated him- 
^ self stiffly beside Cian. his pale 
eyes flicking toward the doctor and 
away again as though avoiding some- 
thing repulsive. 

The chairman spoke. “You are 
Rom Lekir, operations administrator 
of the Niraan mining colony for the 
Megeyn Corporation?” 

“T ” 

1 am. 

“How long have you held that 
position?” Cian asked. 

Lekir ’s nostrils flared. “Chair- 
man,” he demanded, “what is the 
meaning of allowing this Preserva- 
tionist zealot to— ” 

“Sar Lekir,” the attorney inter- 
rupted smoothly, “the Megeyn Cor- 
poration is anxious to cooperate with 
the board in every way possible.” 
Without looking at Cian, Lekir 
replied woodenly, “I’ve been on Nira 
nearly seventeen Standard years.” 
“Then you 'were there even before 
the charter inspection?” 

“I was one of the original corpora- 
tion survey crew.” 

“You have been able to observe 
the shree longer than any other man. 
Think carefully. Have you noticed 



any major changes in their be- 
havior?” 

He snorted. “Rather! In the begin- 
ning they were somewhat friendly. In 
fact, one bachelor was camp mascot 
for a long time. But now— well, you 
can’t find a more vicious species on 
the planet.” 

“Really?” responded the chair- 
man. “What do you think changed 
them?” 

Lekir shook his head. “Who 
knows? We had a rough winter one 
year and a lot of them starved to 
death. Animals are always meaner 
when they’re hungry. And that was a 
bad time, believe me. We had supple- 
mental packaged rations or we’d have 
been starving, too.” 

“You ate native game?” 

“Of course. We always do when 
the local proteins are compatible.” 
The survey agent toyed thought- 
fully with a cassette. “And the shree 
have been attacking you ever since?” 
“No. They stopped when spring 
came. They didn’t attack any more 
until the next winter, and then only 
if they didn’t see us carrying lasers. 
We’d killed enough of them with 
lasers the winter before. They had 
learned to be wary.” 

“Did the attacks stop in the spring 
again?” the arthropod asked. 

“Oh, yes.” 

“Vicious in winter, wary the rest 
of the year,” the blue-skinned board 
member murmured. “How long did

113 




the pattern persist, would you say?” 

“About five years. After that they 
didn’t seem to care what season it 
was or whether or not we were 
carrying weapons. They’re quick 
enough to be on you almost before 
you see them, then away before you 
can take good aim.” 

Cian regarded the fur on the backs 
of his hands with great concentra- 
tion. “By any chance, did these new 
tactics start the same year full-scale 
operations did?” 

Lekir nodded. ‘The crews dou- 
bled. It was a headache. There were 
so many new men I couldn’t watch 
all of them to make sure they were 
armed when they left camp. Half the 
injuries in the infirmary were caused 
by the shree.” 

‘‘When did they start carrying dag- 
gerthorns?” 

“Two years later.” Lekir snorted. 
“As though they weren’t deadly 
enough already. They can hit a man 
hard enough to break his back— not 
to mention what their claws can do 
to his face and eyes. When they 
started with those thorns, only the 
charter restrictions against tampering 
with the local ecology kept me from 
wiping out the beasts. I respect the 
Bureau of Surveys’ purpose, but after 
Morka and Chaasse I have to t^e 
steps to protect the crews. They 
can’t be expected to continue risking 
their lives working under the present 
conditions.” 



“Ah,” the attorney said. “How 
many men have been killed by 
shree?” 

“Fifty over a period of nine years. 
Fourteen this year. But this year 
alone injury cases amount to over a 
hundred.” 

“I’ve heard all I need to,” Cian 
said. “You’ve been very helpful, sar 
Lekir.” 

“I really cannot see how, doctor,” 
the chairman said. His carapace 
groaned as he shifted in his chair. 
“Would you please explain?” 

“Certainly, unless someone else 
wants to ask sar Lekir a question.” 

“I have some questions.” It was 
the first time the ethereal-looking 
female board member had spoken. 
There was nothing ethereal about the 
crisp, clipped tones of her voice, 
however. “Administrator, has it ever 
occurred to you since the charter 
inspection that the shree might be 
intelligent?” 

“Of course not. The inspector 
called them animals.” ^ 

“The doctor believes otherwise.” 
Lekir gmnted. “Or says he does. 
He’d say anytfiing to save them even 
if they were jellyworms. You know 
Preservationists and R’raethans.” 
“Then how to you explain the fact 
that the two miners were poisoned?” 
“Accident. The daggerthoms just 
happened to get in some sweetvine 
juice. like I told the doctor when he 
came to me with that ridiculous 



114 



IF 




hypothesis, the beasts were eating 
berries and happened to smear the 
thorns with some of the juice.” 

The board member sat back. “I 
have nothing more to ask.” 

“Are there any other questions? 
No? Then you’re excused, sar Lekir. 
Thank you for coming. And now, 
doctor,” the chairman said, as the 
door closed behind the operations 
administrator, “what conclusions did 
he help you reach?” 

“I believe there was no mistake 
made in the original classification. 
The shree have evolved their intelli- 
gence since then.” 

“In twelve years! Ridiculous,” the 
attorney exclaimed. 

OT at all^” Cian said calmly. 
“None of the authorities on 
sentience are able to agree as to when 
and how the transition from animal 
to rational being is made. But they 
all agree on why. The inspector can 
correct me if I’m wrong, but the 
reading I’ve done postulates a state 
called pre-sentience, in which a ■ 
species is at the borderline of intelli- 
gence.” 

The survey agent nodded. “I see 
where you’re going, doctor. Please 
continue.” 

“Although it obeyed the charter 
restrictions to the letter, Megeyn 
changed the environment of Nira by 
its mere presence. The crews gave the 
shree competition they had never 



had before. Men, better equipped to 
hunt, were taking, shree tenitory and 
shree food. The shree had to adapt or 
die.” 

“So they developed intelligence?” 
the chairman prompted. 

“No species develops a new char- 
acteristic just because it needs it,” 
the survey agent replied. “But all 
species are constantly mutating. 
There are endless variations of type 
in every life form. When a need 
arises, survival favors the individuals 
having a variation to meet that need. 
If no member of the species has such 
a characteristic, that species becomes 
extinct. If the shree were pre-sentient 
they would have already had the 
capacity for rational thought— they 
just weren’t using it. The added 
difficulty of surviving simply trig- 
gered utilization of their dormant 
ability.” 

The board members were listening 
attentively. The agent continued: 

“I suspect that if I were to inspect 
Nira again, I would find them essen- 
tially as they were twelve years ago 
except in the vicinity of the mining 
operations, where the environment 
has altered. Only the individuals 
there will have evolved.” 

‘Then as a whole they aren’t 
actually sentient,” Bin Saal said. 

“But they’re in the process of 
becoming so,” Cian argued. 

“The fact remains,” the attorney 
persisted, “that the species isn’t intel-

ligent. What we have, then, is a 
handful of mutations, sports, whose 
so-called intelligence may disappear 
again if the environment returns to 
its previous condition. Chairman, 
Nira is an important planet— a world 
rich in minerals necessary to main- 
tain our level of civilization. Should 
we deprive the Federation of those 
riches because of some dubiously 
labeled ‘people’ who cannot now— 
and may never-appreciate the re- 
sources of their planet?” 

“Are we justified in denying them 
the chance to do so?” Qan coun- 
tered. 

“Just a moment, doctor,” the 
chairman said. “The board is grateful 
for having had this matter brought to 
its attention and for your help in this 
hearing. There is no need for you to 
be subjected to the legal debate that 
will follow. Both you and the in- 
spector are excused.” 

“But-” 

“Thank you, doctor.” 

The dismissal was final. Gathering 
up his hand file, Cian followed the 
survey agent out of the room. He 
caught up with the Geolon a short 
way down the corridor. 

“What do you think, inspector? 
Does the lawyer have a good argu- 
ment?” 

“Law isn’t my specialty. But I 
imagine the soundness of his argu- 
ment is irrelevant. The bureau is 
notorious for protecting planets from 



pollution and exploitation. Its stub- 
bornness is rarely affected by the 
kind or number of individuals in- 
volved. In any case, nothing final will 
come of today’s proceedings. We’ll 
be asked to re-survey Nira and judg- 
ment will be based on the results. 
Then Megeyn will appeal and the 
Preservationist leaders will join the 
fight and the entire matter will be 
tied up in the courts until, by the 
time anyone is able to get back to 
Nira, the diree will have gone one 
way or the other and resolved the 
question themselves.” His scalp fur- 
rowed in amusement. ‘Tell me, have 
you ever considered doing survey 
work? We can always use people 
willing to fight commercial interests 
in order to protect obscure creatures 
on backspace planets. Enlist— and 
you may even be put on the Niraan 
project.” 

“Niraan project?” Cian echoed. 

“Certainly. While the law is grind- 
ing slowly, the bureau is going to be 
busily scurrying about on Nira. Doc- 
tor, this is our long-awaited oppor- 
tunity to study emerging intelligence 
and resolve our speculations in the 
process. It’s the important event of 
the millennium. You’ve probably 
earned yourself a footnote in his- 
tory.” He grinned at the doctor’s 
startled stare. “Such are the risks we 
Preservationist zealots take. Let me 
buy you a cup of tea before I report 
to my superiors.” •

OF EESHTA 

F. M. BUSBY 

The Demu believed that to civilize is 
to make conform— by wielding a scalpel! 



(Editor's note: Although they are 
implied as occurring offstage in the 
author's forthcoming novel, Cage a 
Man (NAL and SF Book Qub, Sept. 
'73J, the events in this story are 
published only on these pages. They 
are too good for readers to miss. ) 



T he young person is surrounded 
by the animals. In this room on 
their planet Earth— a strange room, 
all plane surfaces and right angles— 
Eeshta is their captive. One of them 
has taken its robe and hood; under 
the odd discrete lighting-sources the 
smooth exoskeleton shines ivory 
tinged with red. Eeshta is of the 
Demu and eggborn. The symmetry 
of its head is broken only by the 
eyes and their brow ridges, the 
nostril openings and serrated chew- 
ing-lips below, the slightly flanged 
earholes. 

The heads of the animals are 
marred by fleshy and fibrous 
growths. Although their general 
shape is acceptable— head and body, 
arms and legs— they do not have 
correct appearance. None but egg- 
born Demu have correct appearance 
without aid. When captured animals 
learn to speak as Demu and thus 
earn citizenship they are given what- 
ever aid is needed. 

But now it is Demu who are 
captive— the young Eeshta, its egg- 
parent Hishtoo, and three not egg- 



born. Taken by an escaped animal 
named Barton, they were brought in 
Hishtoo’s ship from the Demu plan- 
et Ashura to Earth. Although its 
arm was broken in the struggle of 
capture Eeshta no longer fears Bar- 
ton, for Barton encased the arm for 
healing and offered no further in- 
jury during the long journey. 

Eeshta fears these animals. It does 
not know what they want of it, ex- 
cept that it learn to speak with them. 
Demu do not speak with animals 
nor in the tongues of animals. Hish- 
too has told it thus and the young 
person respects the word of its 
egg-parent. After a time the animals 
cease their attempts. 

One enters who is Demu but not 
eggborn. It is of the type that grows 
young inside itself. Before its citi- 
zenship it bore on its chest the 
growths by which such persons 
nourish their young. 

To correct its appearance such a 
one requires much aid. Knives and 
other instruments eliminate the 
growths on head and face, remove 
the teeth, notch the lips, and short- 
en the tongue to proper proportion. 
Chest and crotch are pared to 
smooth and sightly contours. Fin- 
gers and toes are rendered clawless; 
if necessary the number at each 
extremity is reduced to the proper 
four. On the abdomen the single 
useless depression is replaced by a 
pattern simulating concave oviducts

and their matching convexities, 
which produce cells to fulfill the 
eggs. This is how deserving animals 
are honored for their intelligence. It 
has always been the way. 

The one who enters is called 
Limila. On Ashura its appearance 
was made correct. It wears the 
proper robe and hood but has add- 
ed a cloth that covers its entire face 
except the eyes. It did ;iot do so on 
the ship during the trip to Earth. 

It approaches. “It is that you do 
not speak, Eeshta, and that you 
should.” 

“It is that you, Limila, not egg- 
born,^ speak with animals. I do not.” 
“It is that you are foolish. On 
this world you can now speak only 
with Hishtoo or with me, or with 
the other two who are made Demu. 
Much is to be learned here, and you 
learn nothing.” 

“You may learn, and tell me in 
our own speech.” 

Limila nods. “That for the pres- 
ent we do it so. Also that I ask 
questions and you answer. Later we 
speak more of this.” 

“It is as you say, but that I have 
my robe and hood.” The garb is 
returned to Eeshta. The questions 
begin. An animal speaks to Limila, 
who asks the questions. When the 
young person answers, Limila speaks 
to the animal. Eeshta’s fear is soon 
dead of boredom, as the egg-child 
waits while things are said that it 



does not understand. It finds itself 
trying to understand and quickly 
changes its thought. 

“It is,” says Limila, “that we 
would know of your age.” 

“That I am nearly three of the 
four fingers toward end of growth.” 
Eeshta waits while Limila and the 
animal speak. 

“It is that your duration may be 
counted in revolutions of your plan- 
et around its star.” 

“We do not count it so. And 
Ashura, where Barton escapes and 
takes our ship, is not my planet. 
The revolutions of my own planet, 
while we are on Ashura, are not 
known to me.” 

Finally the speaking ends. Eeshta 
is taken to its place and fed with 
Hishtoo and the others. While eating 
it does not speak with any, nor 
wish to. 

66 CHE’S such a tough little devil, 
•bright, Limila?” Annette Ling 
smiled across the table. Then her 
delicate Oriental features moved in 
a slight frown. “In more ways than 
one. Not as bad as Hishtoo, though. 
That one wouldn’t talk at all.” 

“He talks. Dr. Ling, when Barton 
asks questions through me or Sie- 
wen to learn about the ship. Hish- 
too fears Barton, and with reason.” 
She shook her head under the hood. 
“They are not he and she, of 
course. Each of them is both. I have 



120 



IF 




listened too much to Barton— and I 
suppose it is natural to assign gen- 
der in terms of size.” 

“Yes. You know, I’d like to meet 
this Barton of yours.” 

Within the concealment of hood 
and veil Limila shook her head 
again. “Not mine, not now. He 
allows me to live with him, but 
cannot bring himself to . touch 
me. 

For a moment, embarrassed, Ann- 
ette did not speak. She brushed her 
fingers through^her short black hair. 
“Uh— why does Hishtoo fear him?” 

“You have not heard? How he 
forced the ship from Hishtoo, to 
bring us here? Barton was without 
food but had Eeshta captive. He 
threatened to begin eating her 
alive.” 

Dr. Ling gasped. “Would he 
have?”^. 

“I do not know. I have not 
asked. But once aboard the ship he 
broke both Hishtoo ’s arms so Hish- 
too could do no mischief. And 
when Barton says to Hishtoo, ‘crab 
salad,’ Hishtoo answers any question 
I ask.” 

Annette Ling’s laugh was shaky. 
“I’m not so sure I want to meet the 
man, after all.” 

“You must remember, he had 
been seven years— more than that— 
in a Demu cage. The ship was his 
only chance for escape. And he had 
no other way to restrain Hishtoo 



safely, short of killing him outright.” 

“Yes. Yes, I can understand that. 
And he rescued you and the other 
two?” 

“We were there, at the ship. 
Although Barton had refused to 
learn Demu speech, Hishtoo offered 
him citizenship as an inducement to 
surrender and return Eeshta safely. 
We were supposed to be . ex- 
hibits, to persuade him. Hishtoo did 
not understand Barton very well.” 

“I should say not.” Annette paus- 
ed. “Limila, do you feel that Eeshta 
will cooperate more fully, eventual- 
ly? To counter the Demu threat, 
the raiding and kidnaping, we must 
know more about them. Eeshta is 
the only window we have any 
chance of opening. It would help a 
great deal if we could speak with 
her directly.” She raised a hand 
against an unvoiced protest. “I 
don’t mean to say your help has 
not been invaluable. But still-” 

Behind the veil she saw maimed 
lips move in a kind of smile. “Yes, 
doctor. As Eeshta would say, I am 
not eggborn. For more than six 
years, after what was done, I lived 
as Demu. But I’m aware that I don’t 
fully understand them.” Her 
hands, together, clasped and un- 
clasped. “And Eeshta? I do not 
know. The Demu never speak an- 
other’s language. It may be that 
they cannot learn as we do. We can 
only continue to try.” 



THE LEARNING OF EESHTA 



121 




“Yes, and hope for success.” A 
knock sounded. “Come in.” A boy 
entered with coffee and a snack 
plate. Annette moved papers to 
leave a space on the table. ‘Thank 
you,” she said. He smiled, set down 
the tray and left. 

“I’ll pour for us, Limila. Cream? 
Sugar?” 

Her cup prepared, Limila raised it 
to her veil a moment, then set it 
down. “Thank you, but I do not 
want any, I’ve decided. I must go 
now.” 

“Limila! We’re probably going to 
be working together a long time. 
Can’t you-” 

“You have seen me.” The voice 
was flat, wooden. “In the pictures, 
at least. Do you wonder that I hide 
myself?” 

A small five-fingered hand diot 
out to grasp one that now had only 
four. “Oh, damn all! I do tend to 
forget that anything is important 
other than my work. But I feel I 
know you only from outside, and— 
well, it was a long session. You 
should have some coffee and a bite 
to eat. I’ll go out, if you wish. I’m 
sorry, Limila. Forgive me?” 

Limila shrugged. “You have not 
harmed me. The harm was done 
before. And if you wish to see me, 
I can bear it if you can. When we 
are alone—” She removed the veil 
and pushed back the hood. 

For long seconds, seeing what 



had been a woman’s face, Annette 
ling could not speak. “Yes,” she 
said at last. “When we are alone. 
Thank you, Limila.” She busied 
herself, leafing through her notes. 

“Now I’d like you to look at the 
questions my team has prepared for 
us to ask Eeshta tomorrow. Do you 
think perhaps—” 

As they talked, Limila sipped 
coffee and ate small bits of cheese 
and wafers. Without teeth it was a 
slow process. 

T he young person has eaten. It 
sits with its egg-parent Hishtoo 
and the two Demu not eggborn. 
They are of the type that does not 
grow its young inside but supplies 
cells to fulfill the eggs. Siewen, the 
frail one, supplies no more such 
cells. It is one of the first of its 
kind to be made Demu and live; 
there was no knowledge that to 
provide conect appearance to its 
legs-juncture would render it useless 
for breeding. Like Limila it speaks 
with animals, but only in response. 
Here among Demu it does not 
speak. 

The other has taken the Demu 
name Shestin and does not speak 
with animals. It was given citizen- 
ship later when more was known of 
its kind. Its appearance* where its 
legs join is not fully Correct. Protru- 
sion has been minimized but not 



122 



IF 




entirely eliminated; this one, it is 
hoped, retains the ability to fulfill 
eggs. It shows no »gns of wishing to 
do so. On the ship it did not speak 
to Barton. Barton called it Whosits. 
Those who bring food call it The 
Freak. 

Hishtoo addresses its egg-child. “It 
is that you speak with animals?” 

“It is that I speak with Limila 
who speaks with animals. I do as 
you.” 

“It is that I should not. But the 
animal Barton—” 

“It is that first you do not speak 
with Limila in the presence of ani- 
mals. But when Barton makes the 
sound ‘crab salad,’ then you speak. 
I do not know that sound.” 

From Siewen comes a harsh 
cackling. 

“It is,” says Hishtoo, “that your 
mind is not waking when Barton 
first makes that sound. Then, if I 
do not give the ship to it, it eats 
you. On the ship it destroys use of 
my arms. And the animal Barton 
eats me now if I do not speak of 
the ship with Limila and Siewen. 
But I speak much of no truth.” 

“It is that if Barton finds you 
speak not truth, Hishtoo—” 

“It is that we have no certain 
way of safety. That the worlds must 
know the Demu and become Demu. 
Barton eats me before I allow it to 
eat our race.” 

The young person pauses, think- 



ing of what it knows. “It is that 
when we meet, Barton harms me also 
but will not do so again. I do 
not know when it says to eat me, 
for as you say, my mind is not 
waking. It is that the animal puts its 
hand to my head and makes a soft 
sound when I have pain and want 
. no more.” 

“It is that you forget, Eeshta, 
that it is an animal and of no 
assured mind. You forget no animal 
is Demu. Barton has not our speech, 
nor correct appearance.” 

“You say much truth, Hishtoo. I 
think on your saying.” The young 
person thinks of what it knows, and 
of what it does not know. 

¥ IMILA waited. When Barton 
^ arrived, his dinner would not 
take long to prepare. He did not 
need her to cook for him; he could 
manage well enough on packaged 
meals. But he had brought what was 
left of her away from the Demu. 
She had no one else and felt he 
deserved some payment for suffer- 
ing her monstrous presence. So she 
did what she could, though she 
found it ever more difficult to talk 
with him. 

A groundcar stopped outside. Bar- 
ton’s footsteps approached and he 
entered. “Hi, Limila. You have a 
good day?” 

He sounded as though he were 
reciting a set speech. 



THE LEARNING OF EESHTA 



123 




“Good enough, I suppose. Are 
you hungry, Barton?” 

He looked at her, then away 
again. When they were alone she did 
not wear the veil. It was no use. On 
the ship he had seen her without it 
too long. 

“In a little while-any time you’re 
ready. Right now I need a beer.” He 
rummaged in the refrigerator, then 
sat near her. 

“Hishtoo’s lying, you know,” he 
said. “At least half the time, maybe 
more. That big lobster is nobody’s 
fool.” 

“You have charged him with ly- 
ing?” 

Impatiently Barton shook his 
head. “Wrong approach. Let him 
think he’s getting away with it. For 
now at least. No, we just keep 
asking questions, sometimes the 
same ones from a different angle. 
He’ll slip up-he already has. We’ll 
transcribe the tapes and cross-check, 
feed them to the computers. No- 
body can lie consistently over the 
long haul. The parts of his story 
that don’t stay put we can throw 
out. Where it hangs together it’s 
probably true. And sooner or later 
we’ll figure out how the Demu ship 
works.” 

“And the Demu mind, Barton?” 

He looked at her, his expression 
unguarded for a moment, as though 
she still had a face. “That’s the hard 
part, isn’t it? What you’re doing. We 



need force, sure— ships, and all— to 
stop the raids. But we need to 
know about them, too, and the 
little one’s the key. How you com- 
ing with her?” 

“It is hard to be certain. She 
answers questions now, but oblique- 
ly.” 

“Comes by it naturally, I expect. 
Her egg-daddy’s a liar by the clock. 
Too bad-I’ve gotten to like the kid, 
but she sure as hell comes from a 
rotten family.” 

Explanation was too difficult. 
She served dinner instead. Barton 
ate silently, saying only, “Hey, 
pretty good there,” after the first 
few bites. When he finished, he said, 
“You want to watch the Trivia or 
anything?” 

“The Tri-V? No, Barton.” 

“Yeah. Well, maybe I’ll read a- 
while.” 

“Yes, Barton.” But she needed to 
talk. “Barton?” 

“Yeah? Something?” He seemed 
attentive, so she plunged ahead. 

“Barton, how did you know not 
to learn Demu language?” 

“Huh? Oh-well, I didn’t. I mean, 
I didn’t know what happened to 
anyone who did. But they pushed 
me around so long before they tried 
the talky-talk that by then I was 
too stubborn to do anything I 
thought they wanted. A lot hap- 
pened that I never told you—” 

a lot, she thought, that I can 



124 



IF 




never tell anyone. “I wish I had 
been stubborn, Barton. But I was 
alone and did not want to be alone, 
and I did not guess that harm could 
come from learning.” 

She rose and walked over to him. 
Once more, she thought, and then 
not again. She took his hand. “Bar- 
ton? I-” 

He clasped her to him but turned 
his face away. She heard him curse, 
his voice thick. Then he said, more 
quietly, “I wish I could, Limila. I 
wish—” He released her. “Oh, hell! 
I’m going to bed.” 

She went to her own room. This 
is not life, she thought. I am not 
living. I need to work yet awhile for 
others, and then I can stop. 

The thought comforted her more 
than any had in a long time. 

T he young person sits with 
Limila and the animal Lkig. 
The fourth of the second four of 
questionings begins. Against its will 
Eeshta understands more each time 
of animal speech, but as Hishtoo 
has said to do, it pretends ignor- 
ance. 

Also it understands some mean- 
ings of Ling’s face-movements. The 
downward-together pull of the small 
dark growths above the eyes means 
the animal is dissatisfied. The young 
person has known this meaning ear- 
lier, for on the ship Barton often 
made this sign— but never the up- 



curving of incorrectly smooth 
mouth, indicating pleasure, that 
Ling makes. Eeshta has made the 
Demu sign of pleased feeling, mouth 
opened slightly to show the tongue 
uplifted, but Ling does not under- 
stand until Limila explains in animal 
words. Then, to Eeshta, Ling lifts 
its own tongue, so incorrectly long. 

Eeshta is certain Ling comes to 
understand some Demu ^eech also. 
It sometimes speaks before Limila 
fully repeats Eeshta’s saying. On 
Ashura perhaps Ling would soon be 
worthy of citizenship and correct 
appearance, though Eeshta is sur- 
prised to find that with familiarity 
the animal’s deformities are less of- 
fensive and begin to seem natural. 

Now Ling speaks directly to 
Eeshta but in its own animal 
speech. “Eeshta, do you know what 
I say? You do know, don’t you?” 
“Limila, it is that Ling speaks. 
That you tell its saying in our 
tongue.” 

“It is that I hear you,” says Ling, 
“that you hear me* also. That we 
forbind and enfeel.” The last has no 
meaning. Ling is not yet worthy of 
correct appearance! 

“It is that I am pleased that Ling 
attempts Demu speech, Limila. That 
it may continue to do so.” 

Ling turns to Limila. “I didn’t 
get that last.” Limila repeats Eesh- 
ta’s words in Demu and then in the 
animal tongue. 



THE LEARNING OF EESHTA 



125 




“I know you understand me,” 
says Ling. “Why won’t you answer? 
Umila? Why?” 

The young person shakes its 
head. Animal gestures demean less 
than animal words. 

“The Demu see no view but their 
own, Annette. We can only keep 
trying.” 

“Yes. But not today, Limila. The 
hell with it.” And to Eeshta: “It is 
that you go to your place, ^at 
another time we speak in both our 
tongues.” 

“Limila, it is that I go to my 
place.” 

As the young person leaves the 
room it hears Ling say, “Sometimes 
I think Barton had the right idea 
the first time.” 



T he young person sits with 
Hishtoo. Across the room Sie- 
wen looks at nothing, while Shestin 
very softly speaks an old Demu 
chant it has learned. Outside, on 
guard so that all must stay in the 
room, is the animal that speaks 
much with upcurved mouth when it 
takes Eeshta to and from its place 
here. Eeshta thinks upon a matter. 

“Hishtoo, when Barton crushes 
our armshells, it is that there is 
much pain.” 

“That the animal gives us pain, 
we remember.” 

“Is it that there is much pain in 



the giving of correct appearance?” 
“Much pain and loss of body 
liquid. It is done over many days or 
animals die of becoming Demu. 
When Barton and the others are 
taken, none of Ashura have experi- 
ence. We lose many as we learn. 
Siewen is one of the first to live, 
and Limila. It is that each for a 
time is near to death.” 

“That I find it not good, Hish- 
too, to give such pain.” 

“It is that the pain is not from 
us, Eeshta, but from being animal 
without correct appearance. That 
animals may become Demu, we do 
what is proper.” 

“Is it that the pain is . soon 
gone?” 

“As correct appearance heals, 
pain goes. And we learn a thing, 
Eeshta. On each day of correction 
we give the greatest pain first, so 
that often the mind becomes not 
awake and does not feel more of 
what is done.” 

‘That I am pleased you give no 
pain without need.” 

A sound is heard. Siewen is 
crouched over, holding itself. Its 
shoulders shake and it makes harsh 
rasping sounds with its breath. Eesh- 
ta moves to bend and peer under its 
hood. Its face below the eyes is 
wet. 

“Siewen,” says the young person, 
“is it that the food today is not 
good to you?” 



126 



IF 




T he animal of the upcurved 
mouth closes the door of the 
room behind Eeshta and remains 
outside. The times of questioning 
now count nearly to two fours of 
fours. Ling sits behind the squarish 
thing that is always covered with 
papers. Limila sits to one side; it no 
longer hides its face and has thrown 
back its hood. Its smoothed head is 
deeper and narrower than is quite 
correct, but the shell of it is inside 
and difficult to reshape. Attempts 
to make such changes cause dying 
and so are now abandoned on 
Ashura. 

The young person moves a seat 
closer to the others and sits. “It is 
that you ask and I answer,” it says. 
“That I would now ask.” 

Limila would spe^, but Ling 
waves a hand and says, mouth curv- 
ing: “All right, Eeshta, we’ll make a 
deal. Ask anything you want— in 
English— and we’ll, answer. What do 
you say?” 

A hesitation. Then: 

“That I do not use your speech, 
that I must not. Hishtoo-” 

Ling waves the hand again. “For- 
get Hishtoo for a minute. We’ve 
been asking questions, playing by 
your rules. If you wish to ask in 
turn, you’ll have to play by ours for 
a change.” 

Eeshta considers. Already it 
speaks with an animal, though in 
Demu tongue. And what it would 



ask, it needs to know. There is no 
need to inform Hishtoo . 

“Then tell me what you really 
want to know from me. And why.” 
Ling nods. “We want to know 
about you, about your people. How 
they think and why they do what 
they do.” 

“What we do? What is it that we 
do?” 

Limila brings its hands near its 
face, its two fours of fingers point- 
ing stiffly toward itself. ‘This!” It 
touches here and there on its head 
and body, on its extremities. “And 
this, and this, and this!” 

“It is only that you are given 
correct appearance, Limila.” Star- 
tled, the young person uses its own 
speech but is not rebuked. 

“But why?” Limila’s voice is high 
and harsh with strain. “Do you 
know what it is to be cut and sewn, 
and to have no face?” 

“I know you had pain, yes.” 
“Pain? I saw others die and en- 
vied their luck. The flesh was bad 
enough, and the teeth. But”— it indi- 
cates the jog at the base of its 
hand— “the disjointing of bones! 
And here!” It points to the nostril 
openings. “There was bone. A saw, 
and the chisels. After the first of it 
I could not see for the blood. Pain? 
You do not know of pain, Eeshta. 
Why, how, can you possibly do 
such things?” 

“But -so you could be Demu and 



THE LEARNING OF EESHTA 



127 




not animal. And now that is a long 
time past. You healed, and are 
Demu and have no more pain.” 

“No pain?” limila’s breathing is 
harsh and rapid. “Eeshta-Eeshta, 
how would you like to have your 
arms cut off?” 

After a moment of frigj^t the 
young person realizes there is no 
threat. “I would not. No one would. 
But why . ?” 

“Suppose you met a race of 
super-Demu with no arms. They 
give you correct appearance by re- 
moving your arms. How would you 
feel?” 

“But without arms how could 
they?” __ 

“Damn your stupid little soul to 
Barton’s hell, they’d bite them off!” 
In awkward haste, Limila pulls its 
robe from itself, crumples it, flings 
it against a wall. Unlike its conduct, 
its appearance is most correct for 
one not eggborn. 

“Annette?” says Limila. “Would 
you diow yourself completely?” 
Ling looks for a moment at Limila, 
then removes its own garb. The two 
stand together. Ling’s appearance is 
not at all correct, but in it Eeshta can 
see a kind of symmetry. 

“Look!” With one hand Limila 
touches itself, and with the other 
the same portion of Ling. ‘This!” 
The mouth, the growth above it 
that is partly bone, the flaps at the 
sides of the head, and at top and 



back the fiber called hair. ‘This!” 
The lumps on the chest, the changes 
at the extremities, the fiber-covered 
protrusion where the legs begin. 
“This! This! This!” It pauses, 
breathing heavily, “These things are 
all part of her. They were part of 
me, too, until you— your people— 
took them from me. My face was 
myself. Now I have no self.” 

“But you are Demu, Limila.” 

“Am I? No. I am not eggborn. I 
cannot in breeding season lock to 
another bearing eggs and at the 
same time fulfill that other. I can- 
not go to Sisshain once to visit and 
perhaps a second time to become- 
or if not, no shame to the eggs.” 

“No shame to the eggs,” Eeshta 
responded. 

“I cannot even truly have correct ^ 
appearance. I am not Demu, Eeshta. 

I am only something that was once 
a woman, who can no longer be a 
woman or even a person, because of 
what the Demu have done to me. 
Because of that I am of no use, 
even to myself.” 

The young person is confused. 
“But the Demu mean no harm, only 
good. Not to take, but to give. It 
has always been our way, when we 
can, to help animals. I am sorry, 
Limila, that even though not egg- 
born you can find no pride in being 
Demu.” 

“Pride? Pride?** Limila shakes its 
head. “Eeshta, you work very hard 



128 



IF 




at not understanding me. Barton, I 
suppose, would call it a racial trait. 
Let me try again. Eeshta, would 
you prefer to live or to die?” 

“To live, of course, Limila. To 
live.” 

“Yes? Why?” 

“Because— because alive I can do 
and learn. Dying ends all of it.” 

limila’s legs shake but it does 
not seem to notice the shaking. 

“Yes. You are right, Eeshta. Dy- 
ing ends all of it. But for me it is 
all ended now. It ended under your 
knives, on Ashura. And I would 
rather die than live as I am.” 

“No, Umila-” 

“If I did not feel I were needed 
here for a time yet, I would die 
tonight.” 

“But how is that? Have you a 
sickness?” 

No Demu mouth ever moves as 
Limila’s serrated lips move now. 
“Not the kind you mean. My sick- 
ness is only that I would take a 
knife and let out all my blood so as 
to die.” 

The young person resists belief. 
“But that is . no one does so 
except those twice-come to Sisshain, 
who would become but do not 
become— no shame to the eggs.” 

“No shame . .” Limila murmurs. 
“You are beginning to understand. I 
cannot become, as you would, be- 
cause I am not eggborn. And I 
cannot become An my own way. 



because of— because of having been 
given conect appearance. This is 
what you do to me and others. This 
is what must be stopped. This is 
why we need to know of you. Not 
to hurt you. But to stop your 
hurting us!” 

The young person is troubled. 
“Can you not still become, LimQa, 
in your own way?” 

“My way? I have no face. I have 
no self. There is no one left who 
can become. I would have . Bar- 
ton would have been my most 
needful person— and he cannot stand 
the sight of me. I cannot stand the 
sight of what is left, either. It is not 
Limila. I am inside, but no one can 
see me, and I can no longer see 
myself.” 

All that Eeshta knows collapses. 
Nothing is left but to believe. “But 
then,” it cries, “Hishtoo is wrong. 
We, the Demu, are wrong. For to 
give such hurt— it cannot be cor- 
rect.” It hardly notices that it 
speaks in the tongue of animals. 

It goes to Umila and holds that 
tall person in its arms as though for 
breeding, although Eeshta is one of 
four fingers short of breeding age 
and Limila not eggborn. And the 
feeling is not of eggs, or of fulfilling 
eggs. 

“Limila, it is that I help you, 
that I learn in both our tongues. 
That I try to tell Hishtoo, though I 
think Hishtoo does not listen or

understand. That when you go to 
our worlds I go also, and tell what 
you say, so that it is known. 

“Whatever else, Limila, it is good 
that Barton brings me here^” 

B arton got home late. Tlie Tri- 
V was off and the lights 
were dim. He had a lot on his mind. 
“Hi! Anybody home?” 

“Yes.” The voice reached him 
from the kitchen. “I am here. Bar- 
ton.” 

She sat leaning back in one chair 
with her feet on another. The drink 
she sipped was dark between the ice 
cubes; the bottle on the table was 
bourbon. She wore no robe or hood. 
For a moment he saw her as she once 
had been, the slim body almost the 
same— but the moment passed, and 
again she was faceless. 

Was there any real hope? He did 
not know yet. 

“Had to work late.” Rummaging 
in the refrigerator, he found a beer 
and opened it. “A breakthrough on 
the Demu spacedrive, if Hishtoo 
slipped as bad as we think he did. So 
I ate in that crackerbox cafeteria, by 
the ship.” And discussed the before- 
and-after, sketches with the plastic 
surgeon ... 

He sat, swallowed beer from the 
bottle. 

“How’d it go with you today?” 
“We broke through also. Barton. 
The young Demu has decided to 



cooperate.” She sipped slowly. 

“No kidding? You cracked the 
shell?” Cartilage grafts, the man had 
said, and prostheses. But no prom- 
ises, not yet— he needed more time 
to study, to draw the boundaries of 
the possible. “Hey, that’s great! But 
how did you get through to her?” 
“Personal talk. Barton. Exchange ‘ 
of reminiscences, among all of us 
there.” 

“All of you, huh? I’ll bet you did 
most of it. Didn’t you?” If only he 
could tell her! He was torn by the 
temptation— but he mustn’t. Not 
yet. 

“I was of some help. The matter 
is not important.” But the ring of 
her voice belied the words. “At any 
rate, it has agreed to learn and to 
exchange information, to reduce the 
conflict that must be.” 

He wanted to go to her, but then 
she would expect more than he 
could give— just as he dared not 
offer hope until he knew its limits. 
“Well. That’s the best news in a 
long time, Limila. It really is. And 
I’m glad the kid’s shaping up.” 

“Yes. We should make much bet- 
ter progress now.” 

“That’s for sure.” He looked at 
her once again, seeing and remem- 
bering. “Hey, you look tired. Rough 
day, really, wasn’t it?” 

Her maimed lips lifted into a 
ragged curve. “It’s all right. Bar- 
ton,” she said. “I’ll live.” •

T he stars hung like ice crystals in 
the bitter night sky. As I shifted 
my feet on the hard sand, searching 
the sky for Ceti s^ps^ wind 
howled off the frozen harbor and cut 
through my worn leathers and moc- 
casins. 

Gray Wolf worked at cutting 
through the wire fence surrounding 
the Cetis’ winter crop. When the hole 
was large enough he motioned to 
Tomis, the smallest of our band of 
twelve. Tomis handed me the reins of 
his pony. “Stay close, Jon,” he whis- 
pered and stalked silently through 
the opening. He kneeled, spread his 
sack and began ripping the purple 
fruit from the plants. The rest of us 
huddled together, watching. Four 
nights had passed since we had 
brought down the last deer, and fear 
and hunger haunted us all. 

Looking at the fruit, ripe and 
succulent, I failed to see the Ceti diip 
dip low and cut across the full 
moon— until too late. 

“Wolf, a ship!” I shouted, jumping 
on my pony. 

Tomis ran to the fence, threw out 
the sack and tumbled after it. “Wait, 
Jon!” he screamed. 

Jaecki, Wolfs woman, scooped up 
the sack in midflight and galloped off 
with the rest of the band. I held 
Tomis’s pony while my own mount 
fought the bit to be off with the 
pack. 

Wolf grabbed the reins from my 



hand and slapped Spotted Mane on 
the rump. “Get out of here! If we 
both make it, we’ll meet at the lake.” 

I kicked Spotted Mane’s sides and 
urged him on with curses whispered 
into his flattened ears. His sharp 
hoofs split the glazed ice that cov- 
ered the beach as he put all his 
heart into running. Behind me the 
throbbing of the ranger ship grew 
louder. I heard a cry and looked 
back. Tomis was on his knees. His 
pony was struggling to its feet. The 
stupid beast had tripped, leaving him 
helpless. Wolf whirled his pony and 
headed back. The ship hovered al- 
most overhead, blotting out the stars. 

As I raced for the shelter of the 
dune reeds I pictured the Cetis, vsnug 
and pink in their padded ship, watch- 
ing helpless humans scatter like a 
herd of frightened sheep. Did they 
laugh when they gave Tomis the 
death-look and he became a puff of 
black smoke that drifted across the 
beach? Did it set their snouts to 
twitching and their ^bloated lips to 
squealing in delight? My hands tight- 
ened on the reins as though I held a 
soft Ceti throat between them. 

I reached the dunes and made 
Spotted Mane lie down in the dry 
reeds— a trick we teach the ponies 
early in life. I crouched beside him, 
breathing as hard as he and feeling 
the musky warmth of his wet hide. 

The night was still again, but this 
time with a threatening stillness. The 



132 



IF 




stillness fugitives know. Stillness dis- 
turbed only by the roar of waves 
dumping slabs of ice on the frozen 
shore. 

Suddenly my ears sifted out the 
whine of the approaching ship. I 
clamped my hand over Spotted 
Mane’s muzzle and felt the throb of 
engines beat in my bones, drowning 
out my own pounding heart. The big 
ship glided over the bay and turned 
west toward Crystal City— known as 
New York when Earth had belonged 
to man, but now referred to by the 
miserable remnants of its former 
population as the ‘Tig Pen.” 

Nothing moved during the rest of 
that bitter night. I huddled against 
Spotted Mane and dozed. 

The next morning squawking sea- 
gulls woke me. I started for the lake, 
wondering how many from our band 
had escaped the deadly Cetis, won- 
dering if Jaecki were among them. 

I traveled most of the day, with 
only my pony and an icy, sand- 
blowing wind for companions, and 
passed many Ceti fields where the 
lush purple plants grew tall in de- 
fiance of the desolate winter. My 
eyes were never off the sky for long. 

At noon I passed north of the 
sprawling Fire Island settlement. 
There old Marco’s people eked out a 
bare living from the unyielding sea 
and lived in shelters of cornhusks and 
reeds. That was the price they paid 
to coexist in peace with the new 



masters of Earth. Last night we had 
paid a higher price to roam freely 
through Ceti land. 

¥ T WAS dark by the time I found 
•*“the lake. I rode to our meeting 
place, my hunger and weariness 
buried by the fear that our band had 
been wiped out. Had I survived only 
to mourn dead companions? 

Through the trees I saw the red 
flicker of a campfire. “Jon!” Jaecki’s 
voice reached me as her shadow 
moved out of the blackness behind 
the fire. She ran to meet me, throw- 
ing her arms around my neck as I 
dismounted and laughing in relief. 
“Gray Wolf, it’s Jon,” she called 
back. Her gentle brown eyes sparkled 
in the wavering light. I ached to hug 
her tight, to run my fingers through 
her dark, swirling hair. But I held her 
at arm’s length and grinned. “You 
weren’t worried about me, were you, 
doll? You know I’m too fast for a 
death-look to catch.” 

Her eyes shadowed with remem- 
brance. “I know you and Gray Wolf 
lingered too long under that death 
ship,” she said softly. 

Gray Wolf strode over and gripped 
my hands. “Jon!” His stony face 
relaxed into a smile. “So— we three 
have made it.” He thrust one arm 
across my shoulders, the other across 
Jaecki’s, and we walked to the fire. 
“It seems the fates have tied us with 
a strong bond,” he said. 



TIME OF THE CETIS 



133 




“I pray they wfll keep it strong in 
the future,” Jaecki murmured. 

“Amen,” I added. 

After I turned Spotted Mane loose 
to graze I realized how racked 1 was 
by hunger. We sat around the fire 
eating the fruit Jaecki had cooked. I 
didn’t bother to remove the small red 
pits and filled my belly as though I 
might never eat again. Our meal 
finished, we drank our fill of icy lake 
water. Then I-wrapped myself in my 
blanket and lay down under a tree. 
The night was clear and cold, with 
frost spangling the flattened grass. I 
stared at the sky where the Milky 
Way made a silver path, wondering 
which bright point was Tau Ceti. 
I’d heard from wandering renegades 
that there were Ceti cities all over the 
country. There was talk also of, 
human settlements that, spread across 
hundreds of miles of desert in the 
western regions. The rest of the land 
was given over to the aliens’ auto- 
mated farms. Earth had become an 
agricultural colony of Tau Ceti and 
was probably keeping the pigs fat on 
many planets. 

Wolf walked over and sat down. 
His mood was grave as he laid a 
newly finished spear across his lap 
and slowly stroked the shaft. “We 
must talk, Jon.” 

I sat up. “About last night? You 
think we’re the only ones left?” 

He shrugged. “I saw three die. 
Picked off like insects.” 



I swallowed to ease the tightening 
in my throat. “How can we fight 
creatures that kill with mind 
power?” 

Wolf hunched forward. “It’s the 
booster we must fight, Jon— the ma- 
chine that amplifies their brainwaves 
a thousandfold, that enables them to 
kill with focused thoughts. If we 
destroy the Crystal City booster the 
Cetis will be helpless.” 

“Wolf, do you plan to do it with 
that spear?” 

“I plan to turn the power of the 
booster against itself.” 

“A nice dream, but it was tried 
more than a hundred years ago when 
the Cetis first invaded Earth. You 
know how successful it was.” 

“Our people used the wrong wea- 
pons.” He gestured sharply. “Jon, 
ever since we left the settlement 
together we’ve been like brothers. 
We’ve shared everything.” 

My eyes roamed to Jaecki, who 
slept with one arm flung across the 
half-empty sack. The embers of the 
fire highlighted each soft curve under 
her deerskin blanket. I pried my eyes 
away and turned back to Wolf. 

“Almost everything.’ He grinned. 
Then his leathery face settled into 
thoughtful lines. He picked up a 
smooth rock and felt its weight. 
“Here’s another thing I’ve kept from 
you.” He flung the rock. I watched it 
arc toward the black woods. Sudden- ^ 
ly it curved in front of the trees and 



134 



IF 




swung back. It thudded into the fire, 
raising ash and embers to swirl 
around it. 

...” I jumped up and 

” stared at the rock, now mo- 
tionless and covered with ash. 

“Sit down, Jon. You’ll wake 
Jaecki,” Wolf whispered. 

I stared at him till he took me by 
the arm and pulled me down beside 
him. 

“I have no Ceti blood in me,” he 
said, “if that’s what you’re think- 
ing.” 

I shook my head dumbly. 

“But the power lives in me.” A 
smile puUed at his lips. “I feel its 
surge and know the direction of its 
force.” 

“The death-look, too?” The impli- 
cations hit me and instinctively I 
shrank away. 

Wolf concentrated on the rock. 
The lines around his eyes creased. 
Suddenly the rock vanished in a puff 
of black smoke and spraying ash. 

I looked at Wolf as though he were 
a stranger. “There were times we 
could have used your power.” 

“I had to hide this gift, Jon,” he 
said evenly. “As a child it would have 
meant death by my father’s own 
hands. My mother would have been 
exiled for having sheltered with a 
Ceti.” 

“But if you are not of the Cetis, 
how . .?”

“I’m not sure. I think it’s simple 
exposure to the waves generated by 
those boosters of theirs. Electro- 
magnetic waves-rays, if you want to 
call them that— that supply power to 
their ships and things, but also some- 
how reinforce their brain waves. So 
they can pull that death-look stunt, 
and work aU kinds of other 
tricks . .” Gray Wolf shook his 



TIME OF THE CETIS 



135 





head. “It’s a mystery, all right. I’ve 
tried to figure it out. The only 
theory I have is that the booster 
waves themlelves can alter individ- 
uals, give them the power. I believe it 
must happen in the womb. Probably 
changes the genes. Probably that’s 
how the Cetis got started on the 
evolutionary process giving them all 
the ability to utilize the booster.” He 
smiled at me. “Look, Jon, I’m not 
the only one. I’ve learned of others 
of our kind who have the power. A 
pitiful few, but maybe we’re enough 
to turn the tide.” 

Astonishment and hope were surg- 
ing in me. And also hurt. “But during 
all these years we’ve spent together, 
you never said a word about it. 
Didn’t you trust me?” 

“Our life is hazardous. If you were 
captured by the Cetis you might have 
given away this secret. The gift is too 
precious to be risked. With it I intend 
to locate the Crystal City booster 
and turn the pigs’ hellish creation 
against itself!” 

He stood up and shoved the spear 
into the ground. Three crow feathers, 
tied to the shaft for good luck, 
fluttered in the chilly breeze. 

“This is for you, Jon. I’ll make 
another for Jaecki. By the way, she 
knows about my power.” 

I pulled out the spear and inspect- 
ed it more closely. “Why do I need 
this?” 

“Jon, I’ll protect you both as 



much as I can. But you’ll be mostly 
on your own after we reach Crystal 
City.” 

I slept little that night. So it 
happened that when four more sur- 
vivors of our band rode into camp 
before dawn I was awake to greet 
them. Joyfully I shouted to Wolf and 
Jaecki. We welcomed the others 
warmly and shared the remaining 
fruit for breakfast. 

Carlo and Paulo, two brothers who 
had never been further' apart than the 
head of a spear and its feathers, had 
taken up the renegade life because 
neither of them had the tempera- 
ment for settlement living. Eli, with 
his easy gait and knowing eyes, was 
the oldest and craftiest of the band. 
He had weathered more years of 
stealing from the Cetis and evading 
their ranger ships than I had lived. 
Last was my burly friend Boris, 
whose thick body was all the bulkier 
for the ragged sheep-fur tunic he 
wore and whose face' was all the 
fuller for ^ts bushy black beard, 
tobacco-stained and matted with the 
remains of many meals. Boris never 
talked in ordinary tones. He roared 
or growled or bellowed. We called 
him Bear. 

While we ate. Wolf told the men of 
his plan to enter Crystal City. But he 
said nothing about his power. They 
muttered and murmured, glancing 
anxiously at one another. 

“By God, I’ll go!” Bear suddenly 



136 



IF 




roared, spewing out half-chewed 
fruit. He wiped his mouth on a 
sleeve. “I’ve always wanted to see 
how those damn Cetis make love in 
their glass houses!” 

“It’s dangerous even to go near the 
city,” Eli commented. He squinted 
over the smoke of his home-made cig 
and thought a minute. “Oh, hell- 
why not? It’s about time we made 
the pigs sweat off some fat.’ 

Paulo stood up. “You can trim’em 
down without me.” He looked at the 
others, then at Wolf. “Make a name 
for yourself if you like. Gray Wolf. 
Me, I’d rather end my days sheltered 
with some big-hipped whore!” He 
nudged his brother with a foot. 

Carlo looked up and smirked. 
“What’s the matter with you, Paulo? 
Think how the settlement girls will 
throw themselves at your feet when 
you tell them you’ve been to Crystal 
City.” 

“We would never live to brag 
about it,” Paulo answered. But his 
brother remained seated and Paulo, 
hesitating, grumbled and then sat 
down. 

Early that night we broke camp 
and took to our ponies. We followed 
the railroad tracks, long rusty and 
overgrown with weeds, that led like 
twin arrows to the city. Game was 
plentiful around the vast Ceti fields 
through which we passed, for few 
humans ventured this close to the 
Ceti stronghold. Alien ships swarmed 



thick as summer flies in the western 
sky. 

During the second night’s ride we 
saw the lights of the spaceport, far to 
the south of us. Eli trotted up beside 
me. 

“Jon, Gray Wolf has told me 
about his power.” 

I turned to him. 

“I’ve always suspected he had it,” 
Eli said. “He’s given me the names of 
friends in several nearby settlements 
who also have it. After the bocTster is 
destroyed and the settlements have 
taken the city, he wants me to take 
charge. I’m to send the gifted hu- 
mans to infiltrate other Ceti cities.” 
He shifted his weight on his pony. 
“Jon, I’m afraid this is a suicide 
mission for you three. Gray Wolf 
doesn’t expect to get out alive.” 

“Did he say that?” 

“He didn’t have to.” 

“Do you think his plan will 
work?” 

Eli shrugged. “It all depends on 
whether or not the boost^s put out 
of action.” 

“And on whether the settlements 
respond,” I added. 

‘They’ll respond. Till now they’ve 
lived with fear and hatred. Take 
away the fear and they’ll respond.” 

“Does Jaecki realize what we’re 
riding into?” 

“I’m sure she senses it. But you 
couldn’t stop her, anyway. She goes 
where Gray Wolf goes.” 



TIME OF THE CETIS

I felt a pang of jealousy. But what 
did it matter? If ^ were right, there 
was no future for the three of us. “I 
hope I have the courage to see it 
through,” I said. 

“I hope so too, Jon.” 

I N the evening of the next day we 
climbed a hill and saw the lights 
of Crystal City. I gasped and heard 
the others too draw their breaths. It 
was like a mirage, a shimmering ice 
city that rose in a blaze of pastel 
lights whose reflections danced on 
soaring glass. Like a carved glacier it 
curved and spiraled, possessed of as 
many hues-and seemingly with as 
little substance— as a rainbow. It 
looked as though it would melt in 
the spring thaw. Each faceted build- 
ing was an integral part of the city’s 
design and contributed to its overall 
dome shape; its reflection in the 
ice-clogged river below made it ap- 
pear round, like a planet alone in 
space. 

Bear bellowed, “It’s the fanciest 
whorehouse I ever laid eyes on!” 

“Oh, so beautiful,” Jaecki whis- 
pered. “Can it really be all evil?’ 

Wolf gave her a look that forced 
her to lower her eyes. 

The two brothers stared and whis- 
pered intensely to each other. 

Eli squinted up at the swarming, 
lights— Ceti ships-above the city. 
“How will you get in, Wolf?” 
“Through an unused tuimel I’ve 



seen in old maps.” Addressing all of 
us, he said, “Jon and Jaecki are 
coming into the city with me. The 
rest of you will camp here and wait. 
If we succeed in destroying the boos- 
ter the Cetis will set up a squeal like 
a thousand pigs being butchered.” He 
looked at his men. “If I’m right 
about the booster it’s the source of 
all their energy, and even the lights 
of the city should fade. When that 
happens, ride for the settlements. 

“You two,” he pointed to the 
brothers, “will bring the news to the 
White Plains settlement. Tell the 
people they need no longer fear the 
Cetis. Tell them to attack and make 
the streets red with Ceti blood!” 
“What about the cities in Jersey 
and Connecticut?” Paulo asked. 
“Won’t those Cetis come runnin’?” 
Wolf shook his head. “At that 
distance from home base, they’d lose 
the power of their own boosters, and 
they won’t have Crystal City’s to 
depend on.” He dropped his hand to 
Eli’s shoulder. “You ride to Fire 
Island. Find a canoe and contact Old 
Marco. Tell him to put aside his nets 
and take up the work of a man.” He 
turned to Bear. “You ride for the 
Mount Vernon settlement.” 

Bear kicked a rock and roared, 
“By God, I’ve come this far. I’ll not 
stop here!” He unstrapped his cider 
bag and flung it to the ground. “I’m 
going into the Pig Pen with yjou.” 
Wolf laid a restraining hand on his 



138 



IF 




arm. “For you the killing lies ahead. 
Remember that the Cetis grow fat 
and careless with success. Make the 
sewers of their decadent cities over- 
flow with the blood of pigs.” 

The others wished us good luck. 
We took our bows and arrows and 
the two spears, and rode to the 
tunnel. 

Di^ounting, we found the en- 
trance had crumbled. We had to 
CTawl over boulders to get inside. The 
tunnel was as black as midnight. We 
felt our way along the slippery walls, 
tripping over broken ground. 
“Damn! We diould have brought a 
torch,” I said. The air was stale and 
heavy. Above us the mighty river 
flowed and I felt as though I were 
buried aUve. 

“Jon, the power grows in me!” 
Gray Wolfs voice was strained. “I see 
the Cetis more clearly. They are 
masters of ^ living things. Qoser to 
gods than to mortals.” 

My throat felt like dried leather. 
How did we expect to defeat the 
Cetis? My spear was suddenly a silly 
toy. I wanted to hurl it into the 
darkness and run for the cold night 
air and the comfort of the campsite. 
I took a deep breath and pushed 
myself on. 

We reached the city end of the 
tunnel and found that it was sealed 
off by stone. But fingers of blue light 
reached through the cracks. I started 
to heave away the heavy blocks. 



Wolf gripped my arm and pushed 
me aside. His face was strange in the 
half-light, grimmer than I’d ever seen 
it. His eyes darkened. I jumped as the 
rocks crashed and fell apart. Smoke 
rose from the seared stones. Blue 
light flooded in through the opening. 

I picked up my ^ear and looked 
at Jaecki. Eyes wide,4ips parted, she 
swayed back from Wolf. 

“Forward,” he said, and motioned 
for us to follow. 

We were on the outskirts of the 
city. The streets were opalescent 
glass that shimmered as light shone 
up from beneath them. A few work 
robots specialized for street cleaning 
rolled by, pushing long, rotating 
bmshes. Above us, transparent arches 
connected gleaming buildings of all 
shapes and curves. It was a glass 
canyon. I thought that surely if I 
took a step, I would walk into an 
invisible wall. 

We heard squeals from a narrow 
street and flattened ourselves against 
a building, trying to hide in a city of 
mirrors. 

A FLYING silver car decorated with 
• gold filigree, hummed as it 
floated by. Four Cetis lounged in its 
padded interior. Two were pudgy 
women, dimple-kneed, wearing furs 
and blue wigs. Red designs were 
painted on their round noses. The 
two hairless men were about a foot 
shorter than I, small-eyed, with pink

jowls that hung over their lace col- 
lars. We held our breaths as they 
drifted by, giggling and drinking 
from green decanters. 

Party-goers, I thought. Most of the 
city probably slept at this late hour. I 
breathed a sigh of relief when they 
were gone, and looked around. A 
man stood in front of me! I drew 
back my spear— so did he— and rea- 
lized it was my own reflection. 
Ragged leathers, soiled and tearing at 
the seams. Dark hair that reached to 
the shoulders and curled into worried 
eyes. Unshaven, crouched, like a 
wary animal. This is primitive man, I 
thought. Man pushed into settle- 
ments and left to rot! 

Wolf led us silently down a wind- 
ing street. He was sensitive to the 
source of the power and it directed 
his steps. As I looked at the buildings 
I realized they were not reaUy trans- 
parent-only the lights in an outer 
wall gave them that appearance. So 
Bear would have been disappointed 
after all . 

We heard footsteps. Wolf pushed 
Jaecki under an archway. I gripped 
my spear, wondering how I’d use it 
against a death-look, as three uni- 
formed Cetis strolled toward us. 
They wore black silk, with silver 
badges on their feathered caps. Their 
shimmering images reflected on the 
street and they seemed to walk on 
water. 

I crouched as they turned our 



way. “Some damn night patrol!” I 
whispered. One Ceti covered a yawn 
and froze. He’d seen us. 

“I’ll take him,” Wolf snarled. As I 
tensed to hurl my spear at another, 
the yawning Ceti evaporated in 
smoke, like an octopus leaving black 
ink behind. I hurled my spear and 
caught the second Ceti in the chest. 
He grunted and blood ran down the 
spear as he fell forward. The third 
Ceti had got over his shock and 
turned for a death-look but he 
caught Jaecki’s spear in his throat 
and fell with a gurgling sound that 
made me think of a sinking boat. The 
archway above Jaecki crackled and 
warped from his death-look gone 
astray. 

Wolf grabbed two dead Cetis by 
their feet and dragged them under 
the archway. I took the third. They 
left pools of blood behind that blot- 
ted out some of the sidewalk lights. 

“See how easily the pigs die?” 
Wolf gloated. He yanked out the 
spears and handed me one. 

“Only because of your power,” 
Jaecki said. Her face was pale as she 
stared at the dead Cetis. 

“It will serve us better when we 
reach the booster.” Wolf handed her 
the other spear. 

We encountered a few ships. But 
their drunken occupants would not 
have noticed us if we had been sitting 
next to them. So we had no further 
trouble.

Wolf stopped before an immense 
cube-shaped building in the middle 
of an open square. It had no lights, 
but, was decorated with small cubes 
jutting from its walls. He put his 
hands on the glossy black metal 
door. It was the only metal I had 
seen in the city and I knew it had 
never been mined on Earth. 

‘This is it!” Wolf whispered, run- 
ning his palms across the door. 

“Are you sure?” 

“Yes. This is where the booster is 
housed, Jon.” 

There was a circular dial with 
numbers on the door. Wolf turned it 
both way« but nothing happened. We 
pushed, then pried with our slate 
knives, but the door wouldn’t budge. 
We circled the building, prying and 
testing, but could find no entrance. 
Wolf looked up at the sheer wall and 
tentatively gripped a cube. I knew 
what he was thinking and glanced at 
Jaecki. She was staring at the build- 
ing and biting her lip. 

66 lyr 0 use standing here looking,” 
I said lightly, and wiped my 
hands on my leggings. 

Jaecki and I tied our spears around 
our waists and let them dangle. I 
began to climb and felt the cube 
edges dig into my moccasins. Like 
flies we scaled the wall. I steeled 
myself against looking down and 
fought the rising panic in my throat. 
But my hand shook from one cube 



to the other, and I was nearer to 
heaven than I would have liked. 

I heard the hum of a car. A few 
seconds later it glided by and we 
froze. ‘That was close,” I muttered. 
But the humming grew louder as the 
car circled back and approached. I 
saw one of the Cetis point at us. A 
police car! I squeezed my eyes shut 
and waited for eternity. It didn’t 
come and I opened them to find 
smoke curling against the dome roof 
of the city. 

I glanced at Wolf. “Glad I took 
you along.” 

We reached the roof and scram- 
bled onto it, for the moment too 
drained to continue. Jaecki looked 
haggard. The hair over her forehead 
was wet. I brushed it back and she 
smiled half-heartedly. “We’re almost 
there now, Jon.” 

I nodded and wondered if Gray 
Wolf or I could protect her from 
what lay ahead. I prayed for a way 
into that damn building. I didn’t 
think I could make the climb down. 

Wolf found the entrance— a narrow 
stairway under a hatch. He led the 
way. He paused at metal doors on 
each landing, shook his head and 
continued down. 

Someone was singing. It sounded 
like the high-pitched screech of an 
untuned violin. An old Ceti, in coarse 
blue clothes, with wrinkled folds in 
his sagging jowls, was walking up 
toward us. We watched him put his 



TIME OF THE CETIS 



141 




hand over a small yellow light on the 
door of the landing beneath us. The 
door slid back silently and he en- 
tered. Then it closed. We looked at 
each other and continued down. 

We must have been below street 
level when Wolf stopped abruptly at 
a landing. He put one hand on the 
metal door and nodded slowly. “It’s 
in there.” My heart jumped as he 
covered the red light on the door and 
it slid back. There was a hallway on 
the other side and a booming noise 
that pounded through me. The beat 
of the city’s heart, I thought. Pump- 
ing power to all the many parts. 

We walked through the hallway 
and came out on a circular balcony 
overlooking a rotunda. A huge ma- 
chine towered in its center, protected 
by a great glass dome. Through the 
glass I saw a maze of wires and coils, 
networks of glossy black metal. The 
noise was deafening. 

Five Cetis were below. One sat at a 
table, punching buttons on a smaU 
panel. Two were at a metal wall of 
dials and knobs, checking each one 
and writing on clipboards. The other 
two were uniformed and sat at a 
table on the far side of the machine, 
playing a game with disks floating 
between them. 

I TURNED to Wolf and pointed at 
the machine. “That must be—” I 
didn’t have time to finish. His eyes 
were narrowed, his face as taut as 



drawn leather. He stared at the boos- 
ter with a lifetime of hate and 
frustration showing in the lines of his 
face. 

We went back to the hallway. 
There Wolf gave us instructions for 
the attack. We padded quietly to the 
lower landing and opened the door. 
Jaecki sneaked up on the Ceti at the 
desk, spear held high. I crouched and 
pointed mine at the closer of the two 
who were checking dials. I watched 
him turn a dial and stare ^t the 
numbers above it. Wolf came up 
beside me and suddenly the third 
Ceti faded. Smoke, billowed up. I 
leaped as my Ceti twisted around and 
dropped his bo^. I plunged the 
spear into his stomach and rolled. His 
scream was lost in the booster’s noise 
as he clawed at the spearhead. 

Jaecki was on her Ceti. Her spear 
stuck out of his shoulder as he 
twisted in agony and tried to turn. 
Wolf yelled for her to move back. 
She did not hear him but fought the 
Ceti from behind, trying to reach her 
knife. I pulled out an arrow, strung it 
and fired. His pink mouth trickled 
blood as he went down with his 
chair. 

Suddenly there was fire in my leg. 
Searing pain tore through me. I 
screamed and clutched my thigh as 
smoke rose. Wolf had killed my 
dying Ceti, but not before the Ceti’s 
death-look had burned me. I stagger- 
ed to my feet. The legging still 



142 



IF 




smoldered around the blackened 
wound. 

The two uniformed Cetis had run 
from behind the booster. One went 
up in smoke. My vision blurred as I 
loosed an arrow at the second one, 
and I only caught him in the leg. He 
pulled the lever of a red box on the 
wall before Jaecki’s arrow killed him. 
Behind us some gauges smoldered 
from his last desperate death-look. 

From somewhere in the building 
we heard the wail of the Cetis’ alarm 
system. 

“Now the game’s up!” I called. 

Wolf turned his attention to the 
booster. He clenched his fists on the 
glass dome. His lips were drawn back 
and his chest heaved with effort. The 
glass began to warp. “Lock the bal- 
cony door!” he yelled over his shoul- 
der. 

Jaecki ran up the hall stairs, came 
out on the balcony and fitted her 
spear through the handle of the 
metal door. Then she went over the 
rail, jumped and rolled. I felt relief as 
she got to her feet spryly. She had 
not hurt herself. 

There was one entrance on this 
floor, a massive pair of metal doors 
that were probably invulnerable to 
the look. I limped over and bolted 
both doors, then leaned against the 
wall, feeling nauseous from pain. 

Wolf had melted a hole through 
the glass dome, but his power had 
little effect on the machinery. He 



shoved his arm through the opening, 
trying to reach the guts of the 
mechanism. He managed to hook one 
finger around a looped wire and 
yanked it out. The booster never 
missed a beat. 

My heart sank. We were so 
close . 

I was breathing heavily and it was 
hard to keep my vision clear. I heard 
Cetis banging on the doors and 
screaming. The way they hit the 
doors, I knew there were many of 
them. I looked at Jaecki, so pale and 
frightened, and wanted to cry. 

Wolf came over. “The doors won’t 
hold much longer.” he said. He held 
Jaecki’s shoulders. “Jaecki, I still 
think I can destroy the booster be- 
fore they get in. But I need your 
help.” 

She looked numb, but nodded. 
Tears welled in her eyes. Wolf hugged 
her and stroked her hair. “They’ll 
remember us, I can promise you 
that.” 

“If she stands aside, maybe they 
won’t kill her,” I said. * 

“And what will they do to her if 
she lives?” 

“Wolf, you’d sacrifice your own 
mother to destroy that damn boos- 
ter.” 

Jaecki pulled away from him and 
touched my arms with her hands. 
“It’s all right, Jon.” Her face was 
tear-stained. “Wolf needs me and I 
want to help.” 



TIME OF THE CETIS 



143 




I took a deep breath and nodded. 
‘‘Sure. If we have to go, let’s take the 
damn thing with us!” 

Wolf told us his plan, then went 
back to the booster. Jaecki and I 
stood by the doors, ready to unlock 
them at his signal. The Cetis were 
battering them hard. The doors rat- 
tled each time they were hit. 

Wolf stood directly in front of the 
booster, making sure that the hole 
could be seen from the doors. Then 
he began burning it out larger. He 
was using himself as bait. I had to 
admire his courage. 

He lifted his arm for the signal— a 
lone figure, framed by that hellish 
machine. I prayed I’d have the cour- 
age to see it through as I gripped the 
bolts. 

Wolf dropped his hand. I took an 
unsteady breath and released the 
bolts. Jaecki unlocked her door. Her 
eyes were on Wolf as the Cetis 
poured in, screaming their rage. A 
door slammed into me and I feU. A 
few of them rolled over me. There 
were twenty, thirty, scrambling 
through the doors. 

I watched Wolf step in front of the 
hole in the glass. Behind the amused 
grin he wore for the Cetis I saw a 
look of quiet satisfaction as they 
used their death-look on him in sheer 
panic. 

He was gone. I was overwhelmed 
by a crushing sense of loss. Jaecki 
had found her way to me and I 



reached out desperately for her to 
touch her one last time. My hands 
fumbled through smoke. 

But the concerted death-looks of 
the Cetis had accomplished what one 
death-look could not. The booster 
crackled and sizzled. Coils burned, 
wires smoked and twisted like steam- 
ing snakes. The deafening beat fal- 
tered, receded to a shrill >^Wne. 
Sparks spewed, followed by flames. 

The lights dimmed. I blinked, but 
they faded completely and I realized 
that Wolf had been right. The Cetis’ 
total power source had been wiped 
out! Only the sparkling flames of the 
booster lit the Cetis with flashes of 
red light that pierced the black 
smoke and caught them in crumbled 
positions, moaning with their hands 
over their eyes. Then a cry of despair 
filled the hall, a wail of helplessness 
that tore from their throats and 
echoed across the city. Our men 
would be starting for the settlements. 

I watched through the thickening 
haze and with a strange sense of 
detachment as the Cetis turned on 
me. Their shrieking lowered to snarls 
of pure hatred. I took out my knife 
and waited. 

All Jaecki and I had to do was cut 
a couple of them. The rest turned 
and fled. Without their booster, the 
pigs had no strengtk and certainly no 
bravery. 

I hope it is a beginning for my 
race. •

IF 




E very character in any piece of 
fiction worth the reading par- 
takes of the character of the author. 
The character may be an obverse of 
its creator and may not represent 
his/her true beliefs, of course, or he 
may represent only a passing interest 
of the writer, even one shaped by the 
storY at hand. But inevitably he 
grows within the limits and the emo- 
tional framework of the writer. 

However, there is one vital differ- 
ence between a fictional character 
and his/her creator. Once set upon 
paper and allowed to go out into the 
world in print, the character is fixed. 
But the writer’s mind continues to 
other limits-broader, we hope— and 
often to another emotional frame- 
work. Writers change, as do other 
independent thinkers. 



Once upon a time, back in 1941, a 
comparatively young writer named 
Robert A. Heinlein set down the 
story of an almost immortal man 
whom he named Lazarus Long. 
Lazarus lived in the novel, Methuse- 
lah *s Children, which turned out to 
be the final story placed directly in 
what came to be called Heinlein’s 
Future History Series. (Two novel- 
ettes related later events, but “Uni- 
verse” and its sequel were outside the 
regular world-line of the history.) 
Yet the chart of that series, when 
published by John W. Campbell, in- 
dicated a still later novel to come and 
many expected that the long-lived 
Lazarus Long must appear in that. 
Rumors appeared now and then that 
Heinlein was writing that novel and 
recently the rumors were finally con- 



THE READING ROOM

finned. Heinlein was writing it-and 
it has appeared. 

The ultimate novel of the series is 
now available: Time Enough for 
Love, by Robert A. Heinlein 
(Doubleday, $7.95). The subtitle 
identifies it as “The Lives of Lazarus 
Long.” 

Well, thirty-two years have passed 
since Lazarus Long first appeared 
and the writer is about twice as old 
as he was when the character was 
first given birth. 

Most younger writers in any 
branch of fiction—and particularly in 
science fiction— write about the in- 
dividual and his struggles. Heinlein 
did so more strongly than most of us. 
He championed a Korzybskian ra- 
tionality of individual rights and of 
societies designed to permit the ut- 
most individual freedom and privacy. 
In a way, Lazarus Long spelled out 
such freedom. He was one man 
alone. While other long-lived peoples 
of the Howard Families banded to- 
gether he roamed by himself, asking 
no help and taking the world as he 
found it. And when the Howard 
Families collapsed before the pres- 
sures of the short-lived, it was 
Lazarus who stole a starship and 
rescued them— and kept rescuing 
them by his individual strength until 
they could return to be accepted on 
Earth. 

like most other writers, however, 
Heinlein has altered his emphasis 



since that time. Older authors often 
tend to write with special insight 
about human interrelationships and 
the difficult problems of coopera- 
tion. This generally means that con- 
cepts of personal privacy are modi- 
fied in favor of people’s living more 
richly together. 

it would be totally ridiculous to 
expect to find this new novel picking 
up the same old Lazarus Long, un- 
changed after thirty-two years. The 
only way Heinlein could have ^ven 
us essentially the same Lazarus 
would have been to fake his own 
attitudes— something he /refuses to 
do. 

Besides, in our first meeting with 
Lazarus, he was 213 years old, as 
best I can figure it— sort of in the 
bloom of a feisty, lusty youth. In 
this novel we meet him when he is 
2360 years of age— since this takes 
place beginning in 4272. He’s old and 
he’s tired-in fact, he’s trying to end 
his own life when he is discovered 
and given rejuvenation treatments 
against his wishes. 

A suicidally tired man isn’t exactly 
the Lazarus Long we knew before. 
Ihis is a man who has been all over 
the galaxy and has seen and done 
everything for more than two mil- 
lennia. Nothing has any zest for 
him— nothing is new any more. 

Most of the book is built around 
two devices arising from that basic 
situation. The first consists of anec- 



146 



IF 




dotes from his past which are tran- 
scribed into a computer, both to give 
him something to do and to record 
the life of the oldest living human 
being. The second is made up of 
events growing out of the efforts to 
re-arouse his desire to live. The book 
contains enough pages (about 600) 
to include minor bits, such as ex- 
tracted cute, telling, or preachy 
sayings of his. 

The first anecdote deals with a 
man who was too efficient for his 
own good. The second is a brief 
account (amidst much other talk) of 
a time when Lazarus was running a 
house of prostitution oji Mars (rather 
sentimental in its totality) with girls 
whose hearts were golden. These are 
followed by a couple of long novel- 
ettes. 

One deals with Lazarus as the 
owner of a spaceship that trades 
among the stars— Lazarus is here seen 
as a sharp operator who takes his 
chances for profit. He buys a couple 
of slaves. The story evolves around 
his civilizing them, his troubles with 
the job until they settle down— more 
or less-in the restaurant business. 

The other is a rather nice frontier 
story— and perhaps the most natural 
love story Heinlein has written. 
Lazarus has been acting as the banker 
on a world where he’s trying to get a 
new human colony started. He’s 
about to leave when he finds himself 
adopting a daughter and has to stick 



around. She falls in love with him 
and together they set out as man and 
wife into the outback of the planet, 
to face true pioneering. It makes a 
good tale, all in all, but I’m afraid it 
would be less than fresh enough for 
even a Pioneer Tales magazine, if 
such existed still. The one angle of 
freshness here, however, is important 
to Lazarus and to his story. The 
woman refuses ever to accept the 
chance for rejuvenation, even though 
she knows he is semi-immortal and 
she must die of old age while he is 
stai young. And because of this, for 
the first time Lazarus learns to love 
fully. (There are a few science fiction 
bits in the monsters they face, but 
the story really isn’t science fiction. 
The nicest part of it all is the way 
Heinlein handles a mutated mule.) 

A number of small bits scattered 
throughout the first 466 pages of the 
book sew up most of the threads left 
over from the previous Future His- 
tory stories. You can discover what 
happened tg “Slipstick” Libby, 
Lazarus’ best friend, if you are in- 
terested— it’s a rather nice tale. Also 
what became of the aliens on the 
planets met in the earlier Lazarus 
Long novel and what happened to 
the survivors of “Universe”— if you 
don’t skip ovei: such details in your 
reading. Heinlein plays fair about 
such matters— but barely. 

The background for what goes on 
in the universe of 4272 is sketched

in, but with none of Heinlein’s old 
delight in building a complex but 
lived-in matrix for his stories. Men 
have, of course, settled the worlds 
around other stars. Strangely, they 
don’t seem to have found many 
worlds or races inimical to them. In 
the earlier novel the Howard Families 
visited two other worlds and both 
were hostile. The inference was that 
many worlds beyond Earth held dan- 
gers like the Jockerai and the Little 
People— but in this volume we don’t 
hear of them. They don’t serve the 
story here, so they don’t appear. 

What we now have is a love situa- 
tion. Long before, Lazarus had led 
the Howard Families to a new world 
where he had set up a governing 
body, following rules he thought 
might ensure some freedom. The 
government is in the hands of a 
chairman pro tern, since Lazarus— as 
oldest or Senior-will always preside 
when present. When the Families 
find hjm dying they grow deeply 
concerned, feeling that his death may 
curtail their own longevity. They 
coddle him with a computer that 
talks to him and every other sort of 
life-giving distraction— mostly female. 
Sex and love— or sexual love or love- 
you-all sex— are the chief means of 
rehabilitation. (There seemed no 
dearth of this before— every woman 
has always automatically wanted the 
longest-lived Lazarus to make love to 
her and give her a child at once. 



Their hunger may have been reason- 
able when longevity was new and 
uncertain in the Howards— but surely 
in two millennia of its extension they 
should have gained assurance.) 

So we get oodles of loving talk— 
everybody joins in. There is such a 
plethora of “dears” that I had to 
train my eyes not to read them-after 
which the conversations read much 
better. Some endearments proved in- 
escapable. After a girl named Hama- 
dryad (sic) had been Hamadearest 
and Hamadarling for a while, I 
settled on Hamadrip in— perhaps un- 
fair-self-defense. 



¥ FOUND the family in Moon is a 

Harsh Mistress a rather good ex- 
pression of human love and dis- 
covered a great deal genuinely loving 
about the Rolling Stone family. But 
in this novel, unfortunately, I can 
only assume that the endearments 
were meant to show the growth" of 
real affection. They did not work for 
me as intended— their users struck me 
as people who knew nothing of real 
complex human love trying to mimic 
it. 

After a major upheaval occurs on 
the ruling planet Lazarus and the 
main characters set up again on 
another world to carry on. And here 
was the chance for one splendid 
example of the fire and chutzpah (a 
marvelous form of hubris) of Lazarus

to take over. We learn that he out- 
foxed and outbluffed the overpower- 
ing female Howard behind alt the 
trouble and got the others away by 
his old talents. But we are only given 
this in flashback and some conversa- 
tion— as if the feat were of no im- 
portance. 

What seems important from then 
on is the building of a kind of 
commune of love around Lazarus. 
Marvelous things happen— all de- 
signed to give him more love or sex 
or both. He acquires— and makes love 
to— two clone sisters and a computer 
converted into a human female— 
never missing an endearment. (He 
even “deared” the computer when it 
was only a machine.) 

Finally the gang comes up with a 
scheme to end Lazarus’ ages-old 
ennui by giving him something new. 
(By then he hardly seems to be 
planning to give up living-he seems 
generally to be quite pleased with his 
house, houris, habits and harangues.) 
A simple way to travel back through 
time is discovered and he goes back 
to the past. 

He picks 1917, a few years after 
he was born, and goes back where he 
can actually see again his original 
family and review his faded mem- 
ories of them. He meets his mother 
and father, his grandfather— whom he 
remembers best— and even himself, a 
rather unpleasant little kid. 

And he finds himself falling in love 



with his own mother in a wild 
Freudian Oedipus situation. As a 
result of that, he gets trapped into 
the dirtiness, ugliness and senseless- 
ness of World War I. 

This doesn’t read like science fic- 
tion, even though it could only 
happen in science fiction. The story 
here becomes two-fold. Part deals 
with a rich paradox of human 
emotions. Another part is a nostalgic 
looking back (for the reader) to a 
time when things were simpler, when 
the founding values of the country 
were clearer and the virtues surer 
than now. I don’t believe in the 
above as reality from my knowledge 
of people who lived through those 
days. But as a reader, I can’t help 
believing in this dream of the past as 
something to cherish for a while. 

I found the last quarter of the 
book by far the best. Here I found 
love and sexual drives that I could 
accept and see working beyond bed- 
room endearments. 

This part is called Da Capo, the 
title given in the" Future History 
chart to the whole final novel. Inter- 
esting, but I don’t think the section 
was the plot considered on the chart. 

The style of the book varies 
widely. Many of the incidents and 
particularly that final quarter of the 
book consist of what we might find 
in some of our favorite Heinlein— 
straight, direct, with the events and 
the dialogue moving together so well

that we never notice which is which. 
But a great deal of the rest of the 
books is interminably talky, loose 
and essentially uneventful— that is, 
events may be discussed, rather than 
lived. In those sections, the char- 
acters aU blend together into an 
amorphous jell of people who seem 
goody rather than good and strung 
rather than strong. 

I ’VE SPENT a great deal of time 
trying to evaluate this novel as 
honestly as I can and it hasn’t been 
easy. It stiU isn’t. I can’t honestly 
recommend it, because it’s both too 
complex and too diverse in its ef- 
fectiveness for a simple recommenda- 
tion. Neither can I join, with some of 
the disappointed who expected to 
rediscover the pure old-time Heinlein, 
in condemning the book. I can only 
try to prepare the readers to expect 
what I think they will find. 

Don’t look for much of the 
Lazarus Long we met in another tale. 
Some of him is here (albeit partly 
back-stage), but that lad was long ago 
and in another tale. This is not the 
Lazarus Long who took hold of 
100,000 aimless people— but the man 
who was originally named Woodrow 
Wilson Smith and has been taken 
over by the souls and lives of many 
other people. 

Don’t look for the detailed worlds 
that Heinlein has built for us in the 
past— those exterior, consistent, mar- 



velous worlds and social structures. 
The book deals mostly with struc- 
tured interiors and goes little beyond 
what we know. 

And don’t look for marvelous new 
science and developments in the 
future more than 2000 years ahead, 
because they are only incidental to 
what Heinlein’s interests are here. 

Do expect to find a lot of “philo- 
sophical” talk piled on top of the 
mere attempt of people in the story 
to get along with each other— and be 
prepared not to skip it, because 
buried in it may well be the details of 
the Future History you wanted to 
discover. 

I could wish, perhaps, that Hein- 
lein had written a novel called Da 
Capo back sometime around— say- 
1950, when he was stiU close enough 
to the previous novel and the man 
who wrote it. And that he had now 
written another story to fit his cur- 
rent interests, without being at all 
entangled with old bits. 

But perhaps my judgment and my 
wishes don’t matter in this case. I

THE 

MERCHANT 

LARRY EISENBERG 

The strangers came with 
gifts— but what did they 
propose to take away? 



WAS IN THE President’s office 
trying to steady his nerves and 
dispel his sense of persecution when 
a phone call was put through direct- 
ly to his desk. He listened for a 
while, unusually silent, eyes darting 
about. Then he barked a few short 
questions into the phone before 
handing it over to me. 

“What’s this all about, Mr. Presi- 
dent?” I asked. 

His mouth twitched. 

“I’m not sure,” he said. His brow 




was damp with cold sweat. “He 
claims to be General Mackay.” 

I took the phone and listened. 

It was General Mackay, all right. 
I recognized the voice. He was 
calling from the Ice River Air Base 
in Montana and he swore an extra- 
terrestrial spaceship had landed. 

I began to snicker. “Is this a 
practical joke?” 

The President grabbed hold of 
my shirt collar. “I won’t be laughed 
at,” he muttered into my ear. 

Between the President complain- 
ing and this Air brass spouting 
about creatures from outer space I 
nearly slipped my moorings. 

“For God’s sake. General, what 
do 'they look like?” 

“Well, I not only saw one,” he 
said, “I’ve talked to it. It has a kind 
of luminescent glow but no body 
that I can see.” 

At this point the President 
snatched the phone from my hand 
and slammed it back on the cradle. 

“What do you make of all this?” 
he asked, eyes big as silver dollars. 

“I think the general’s brains have 
boiled over. The Air Force has been 
under a terrible strain lately, what 
with not being able to drop nuclear 
bombs. The general must have 
broken under the tension.” 

“I’m frightened,” said the Presi- 
dent. “Maybe that was the general 
calling and maybe it was a Sovcom 
agent trying to make me 



panic. I want you to go to Ice River 
and find out. Then come right back 
here and report in person.” 

Hearing the edge to his voice I 
didn’t wait for further instructions. 

Three hours later I reached the 
Air Force base at Ice River. General 
Mackay was waiting there for me, 
creases missing from his trousers, 
cap awry, eyes numb with excite- 
ment. 

On our way to the landing site 
he outlined what had happened. 

“At 0300 this morning a fireball 
was observed about fifty miles from 
here near Pioneer Falls. The local 
sheriff, after he’d received a dozen 
phone calls, decided to investigate. 
He drove his station wagon all over 
the terrain for an hour before he 
sighted this glowing oval disk in a 
frozen cow pasture.” 

“How big a disk?” 

“About five, maybe six feet 
high,” said the general. “The sheriff 
approached it warily, sniffing fire 
and brimstone, he says, and holding 
on to a small pocket Bible that he 
keeps in his breast pocket. He keeps 
it there so it will be over his heart. 
Bibles have been known to stop 
bullets, you see—” 

■ “Goddamn it, General,” I snap- 
ped, “can’t you cut out all the 
details and get down to the raw 
meat?” 

The general flushed and resumed 
his story. 



152 



IF 




“The sheriff heard what sounded 
like a human voice coming from 
inside the disk and decided that 
he’d gone as far as he was going to. 
He hustled back to his car, radioed 
the State Police. They notified the 
Air Force at Ice River. I was roused 
out of bed, pretty damn sore and 
ready to bust the idiot who had 
concocted this insane story.” 

“And then you found out it 
wasn’t insane?” 

“Come see for yourself,” said the 
general. “I’ve got a jeep ready to 
take you to the landing site.” 

“What about the spaceship?” 
“There’s a guard surrounding it. 
Our visitor is now waiting patiently 
to talk to you. I got word to him 
that you’re the personal representa- 
tive of the President.” That was all 
Mackay would tell me. “I want 
your impressions to be unbiased,” 
he said. 



I WAS still annoyed and skeptical 
when we pulled up to the cow 
pasture where the alleged space ve- 
hicle had landed. There was a pe- 
culiar odor in the air and there was 
something sitting in the pasture. It 
was barely visible in the moonlight, 
just an amorphous grayish-white 
mass. The military guard parted and 
we drove up slowly, rightlo the edge 
of the ship. General Mackay 
stepped outside and called a greet- 



ing. Just ahead of us a flickering 
glow appeared. 

“That’s our guest,” whispered the 
general. 

“My name is Wade Holcomb,” I 
called out to no one in particular, 
feeling like an idiot. “I represent 
our President and I wish to talk to 
you in his name.” 

The glow seemed to hover and 
then moved closer to me. My eye 
caught a flash of metal; I stepped 
back. The general dropped his hand 
reassuringly to my shoulder. 

“What the hell is that?” I asked. 

“Just,^ a box,” said the general. 
“Don’t panic.” 

“I have come in peace,” said a 
soft voice. “This box harbors a 
transducer which enables me to 
communicate with you. By pro- 
fession I am a Merchant and my 
four colleagues within the vessel are 
sales assistants. We have come from 
a planet of the star which you call 
Mekta in the constellation Ursa Ma- 
jor. Our sole purpose is commercial 
in nature. We wish to exchange 
goods.” 

I began to laugh. Tension, I 
guess. 

“Maybe they expect to buy 
America for beads and trinkets,” I 
niuttered to General Mackay. 

He simply shrugged. 

Turning back to the box, I said, 
“I’m not certain we have anything 
in our country to interest you, but 



THE MERCHANT 



153 




I know one thing for sure. You may 
be the answer to our prayers.” 

After more talk we agreed to 
arrange a meeting with the President 
and perhaps his Secretary of Com- 
merce. Then I flew right back to 
the White House. 

The President jumped out of his 
seat when he saw me. 

“Are they for real?” he asked. 

His fingernails seemed to have 
edged down to the skin line. I 
grinned at him. 

“I have something to tell you 
that should please you, sir. It occurs 
to me that with the help of our 
outer-space friends we may have the 
answer to the nuclear stalemate. 
What a great stroke of luck that 
they landed on our side of the 
world and not the other! It puts us 
in position to leapfrog over the 
entire balance of power.” 

The President’s eyes, normally 
oyster-like in appearance, gleamed 
for the first time in months. 

“Maybe,” he said softly, his 
throat muscles working as though a 
savory dinner were being heaped in 
front of him. “But before I raise 
my hopes let me eyeball this plane- 
tary freak.” 

“He may be freaklike in aspect,” 
I warned, “but he makes a lot of 
sense. We’d better proceed cautious- 
ly in our dealings with him. In my 
opinion he and his buddies really 
have come for purposes of trade. 



I’m just wondering what we can 
offer them in return.” 

“I’m on my toes,” said the Presi- 
dent. “Whatever they try, I won’t 
lower my guard.” 

^^HE arrival of the space visitors 
was kept absolutely secret. 
Rumors did float about the country 
and all were denied vigorously by 
authoritative spokesmen. One persis- 
tent newspaper columnist found 
himself in protective custody, un- 
able to draw bail, which seemed to 
have a salutary effect on other 
journalists. 

In the meantime I was grappling 
with the problem of how to 
smuggle the Merchant of Mekta into 
the White House. After much dis- 
cussion it was finally decided, in- 
stead, to take the President to the 
spaceship in Pioneer Falls. He was 
in knots all through the flight and 
required constant reassurance that 
the Merchant would not be a threat 
to his life. As he repeated the same 
questions over and over again my 
gpod humor wore thin. 

But when we landed the Presi- 
dent seemed to pull himself to- 
gether. He said nothing at all as we 
drove to the cow pasture and when 
the spaceship finally materialized 
before his eyes he nodded confi- 
dently as though all his preconcep- 
tions had been confirmed. 

“I want Wade, General Mackay 



154 



IF 




and myself, nobody else, to talk to 
this creature,” he said. “But see 
that we’re closely guarded.” 

There was some grumbling among 
the military staff members but no 
one was willing to buck the Presi- 
dent on the issue. The introduction 
to the Merchant went off well. The 
President flashed all of his city- 
lawyer charm, even forcing his dew- 
laps back into a semblance of a 
smile. He welcomed the Merchant 
and his aides with a flowery speech 
filled with brilliant phrases like “our 
hearts brim over” and “it is a rare 
pleasure indeed.” 

“And now,” he concluded,, “we 
must come down to the mundane 
matters that concern our little world. 
What did you have in mind when you 
talked about trading?” 

“It is somewhat difficult to say,” 
answered the Merchant. “We are an 
advanced people. We can fabricate 
objects and machinery of the great- 
est complexity. Our community has 
no material needs. What we are 
looking for is that which is 
unique-one-of-a-kind art objects, 
animals or even handmade jewelry. 
In other words, we seek what we 
cannot duplicate. We are most in- 
quisitive, always thirsting for nov- 
elties.” 

“So are we,” said the President. 
“We’re pretty clever ourselves and 
I’m sure we make some unusual 
gadgets that you’d want to take 



home with you. But what can you 
give us in return?” 

“As an example,” said the Mer- 
chant, “let me show you a unique 
material.” 

A long glistening tube seemed to 
emerge from nowhere and flowed 
toward us. 

“Pick it up, Mr. Holcomb,” said 
the Merchant. 

I did. It was a transparent ma- 
terial, hard to the touch and light as 
a feather. I passed it over to the 
President, who seemed quite unim- 
pressed. V 

“We can supply you with unlimit- 
ed quantities of this material in any 
desired shape,” said the Merchant. 
“It has some quite desirable proper- 
ties. It resists impact well, is chemi- 
cally nonreactive and absolutely 
leakproof. You may find it ideal for 
construction purposes.” 

“Don’t you have any weapons?” 
asked the President. 

There was a pronounced silence 
from the Merchant. Then: 

“We will not deal in weapons 
under any circumstances.” 

“Why not?” asked the" President. 
I tugged at his sleeve. “Mr. Presi- 
dent, let me talk to you a minute.” 
“Not just yet,” he said. “I want 
to pursue this weapons question.” 
I ignored protocol and whispered 
into his ear. “Don’t you see? This 
material he’s showing us may be 
bomb-resistant. Suppose it’s imper- 



THE MERCHANT 



155 




vious to nuclear weapons? It would 
break the nuclear deadlock!” 

“Too iffy,” said the President. 
“Let’s try it my way first.” 

“Please,” I begged. “Give it a 
chance.” 

The President pondered a mo- 
ment and then, though reluctantly, 
he acceded. 

I turned to the Merchant. “Would 
you object if we suspended our 
talks for a few days? We’d like to 
conduct some engineering tests on 
this material you’ve shown us.” 

“By all means,” said the Mer- 
chant, and after some formal ex- 
pressions of good will we parted. 

T he test results were exciting 
beyond belief. The material was 
impervious even to nuclear explo- 
sions. When I brought this informa- 
tion to the President he finally got 
my point. 

“If we build above-ground shel- 
ters of this stuff,” he mused, “we 
would be on the verge of permanent 
peace for the first time in the 
history of mankind. I could go on 
the air and issue an ultimatum to our 
enemies without fear of retali- 
ation. By God, Wade, you were 
absolutely right! This stuff may be 
better than any weapon he could 
have given us.” 

“I don’t like to be a wet blanket, 
Mr. President,” I said, “but we’ve 
got to handle this point with great 



delicacy. If the Merchant gets wind 
of what we plan to do, he may not 
go along with us.” 

“None of that,” said the Presi- 
dent peevishly. “Either he’ll go 
along with us or his ship will never 
leave the ground. I’ll make sure of 
that.” 

“I don’t see how,” I started to 
say, but knowing the President I 
kept my mouth shut. 

When I returned to the cow 
pasture to tell the Merchant of 
Mekta that we were delighted with 
his material, I brought along plans 
for an above-ground structure capa- 
ble of housing ventilating machinery 
and a large population. 

The Merchant seemed to be giv- 
ing considerable thought to the 
plans. I had to wait fifteen minutes 
for a response. 

“What do you plan to do with 
these structures?” 

“Alleviate our severe housing 
shortage,” I said. “Much of our 
population is still inadequately 
housed.” 

“What you say is probably true,” 
said the Merchant. “And yet I know 
enough about your society to suspect 
that what you seek from these 
structures is some military ad- 
vantage.” 

I sighed. “Such advantage would 
be purely coincidental.” 

“We are a pacific people,” said 
the Merchant. “Even in self-defense 



156 



IF 




we never resort to violence. Perhaps 
that makes us unduly suspicious of 
you. What is needed is a gesture of 
trust in one another. Therefore jf 
you solemnly promise that your ap- 
plication will be solely peaceful, our 
bargain can be completed.” 

‘‘A sacred promise,” I said, know-. 
ing full well that the ends we 
sought were peaceful. 

T he President was elated at the 
news and rubbed his hands joy- 
fully. 

“Time is the important factor 
here,” he said. “We’ve got to get 
one of these shelters fully equipped. 
We must find out for sure if people 
can live in it.” 

Which was exactly what we did. 
The Merchant furnished us with a 
nearly weightless, translucent tunnel 
section capable of housing twenty 
thousand people. He even provided 
an ingenious, atomically fueled 
pump mechanism to circulate and at 
the same time purify the atmos- 
phere within the chamber. We 
gathered up four hundred volunteers 
to stay in the structure for a two- 
week period. The test proved a 
smashing success. 

We placed an order with the 
Merchant for ten thousand units, in 
return giving him credits for an 
equivalent value in American goods. 
He and his assistants set to work at 
once. Week after week, fifty fully 



equipped units issued from his ves- 
sel and were immediately towed by 
plane to different parts of the coun- 
try. Our entire administrative ma- 
chinery was put into high gear, and 
food, clothing, recreational supplies, 
everything we could think of, went 
into the shelters. 

Apparently this flurry of activity 
went unnoticed by our enemies-a 
tribute to the effectiveness of our 
superlative counterespionage ser- 
vices. From time to time, a vehicle 
would “lose” itself in the vicinity of 
one of our new installations, but 
always an alert guard would direct 
it out of the neighborhood. 

At the end of eight months, each 
of the new units was fully opera- 
tional and a full session of the 
National Security Council was called. 
After more than three days of 
discussion the Council decided to 
publicize our new posture. Both the 
national and international press 
were alerted. All diplomats of the 
United Nations and all accredited 
ambassadors were sent engraved in- 
vitations to the unusual dedication 
ceremony to be held at Pioneer 
Falls. 

Just before the ceremony, the 
President flew out to thank the 
Merchant and give him a list of 
items from which repayment would 
be made. I started to tell the Mer- 
chant, in terms as diplomatic as I 
could muster, what was now afoot. 



THE MERCHANT 



157 




But the President brushed me aside. 
He detailed exactly what he now 
planned to do and then waited for 
the Merchant’s reply. It was not 
long in coming. 

“As I feared,” said the Merchant. 
“You never meant to keep your 
promise.” 

“But that’s not true,” said the 
President. “You, sir, seem to have 
missed my point. We don’t seek a 
nuclear war. We want a peaceful 
world for all of us. And now we’re 
in a position to enforce that peace.” 
“On what terms?”. 

“Let me say something,” I blurt- 
ed. “Our neighbors across the sea 
are unreliable, untrustworthy. They 
understand only the force of arms. 
We, on the other hand, are good 
people. We are not malicious or 
vindictive. We covet no territory, we 
threaten no lives. In fact we want 
everyone to have a full life, a free 
life. Our hands and our hearts are 
clean. Would you give the Sovcoms 
the advantage over us?” 

“We never intended to change a 
balance of power,” said the Mer- 
chant. “It is completely foreign to 
our code of ethics. And I am 
seriously disturbed that you should 
have used us in this way.” 

“I don’t mean to be cynical or 
crassly commercial” I said, “but 
you still have a considerable pay- 
ment coming from us. Do you 
remember?” 



“I haven’t forgotten,” said the 
Merchant. 



President was now in his 
* dress rehearsal. The preliminary 
reading of his speech was delivered 
with earnestness and in a room 
chilled to forty degrees Fahrenheit 
to slow down his continual facial 
sweating. The room itself was in our 
new shelter, the one to be dedicated 
to peace. 

One by one our military men 
marched in, resplendent in full dress 
uniform with all battle ribbons neat- 
ly displayed. A chaplain of each 
religion including Islam was also 
present. At the hand signal of the 
communications director, the 
breathtaking ceremony began. Be- 
fore the entire nation and the rest 
of the world the President acknowl- 
edged the presence of extraterrestrial 
visitors. There was a good deal of 
agitation outside the shelter where 
the diplomatic corps was gathered. 

The President then described in 
measured v^rds the nature of the 
shelters the Merchant had built for 
us. When the President was finished 
he accepted a bottle of chilled 
champagne from one of his aides 
and smashed it against a wall. A 
ribbon was cut, and then the Presi- 
dent, at the head of a beaming 
array of military figures and cabinet 
members, led them on a tour of the 



158 



IF 




shelter. He pointed out every detail 
of the living quarters, the library 
that included all the current best- 
sellers, the immaculate wash- 
rooms . 

When the tour was completed, 
the presidential party turned to 
leave~and found the outer doors 
could not be opened. 

I heard nervous chuckles as I 
approached the doors myself and 
activated each of the electrical fail- 
safe interlocks. None responded. 
There was a scuffling outside and a 
flurry of shots, then silence. At that 
point, over the community speakers 
in the shelter came the soothing 
voice of the Merchant. 

“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. 
“There is no danger to anyone.” 

Three of the military aides began 
to batter at the doors. 

General Mackay stopped them, 
yelling, “The shelter is in motion!” 

“General Mackay is right,” con- 
firmed the Merchant’s voice. “You 
are now being towed by my vessel. 
Rest assured that when we reach 
Mekta you will enjoy unending ease 
and comfort.” 

There was a last desperate chance 
and the President took it. 

“What about fair play?” he cried. 
“You say you don’t want us to 
have a military advantage over the 
other side. But now you strip our 
country of its President and military 
leaders.” 



A hush followed. It was as if the 
Merchant were marshaling his 
thoughts. 

“The self-deception of your cul- 
ture is absolutely staggering,” said 
the Merchant. “At the very moment 
we landed in your nation our sister 
ship came down in the icy wastes of 
the other hemisphere. The measures 
taken there to keep our landing 
secret were apparently as effective 
as your own. And of course, the 
leaders of that region claimed to be 
eager for housing, as you did. It 
should come as no surprise to you, 
then, to learn that they now have 
an equal number of shelters and 
that at this very moment a good- 
sized contingent of their own mili- 
tary leaders, and their Premier, are 
also en route to Mekta.” 

General Mackay took off his 
braided cap and wiped his forehead. 

“God help us, we’re his prisoft- 
ers. 

“Prisoners?” said the Merchant. 
“None of you are prisoners. You 
will live in habitats as much like 
your own as possible. And your 
freedom to roam those habitats will 
be unlimited. Our acquisitions are 
always treated in this way.” 

“Acquisitions?” I yelped. “For 
what?” 

“For the Mekta Zoo,” said the 
Merchant softly. 

I would not care to repeat what 
the president said. •

SPACE BOUNC 



STEPHEN TALL 



161 



T he Rangaporn of Czambozat 
would have been a spectacular, 
even an awe-inspiring sight to anyone 
who ever actually saw it clearly. Of 
course, that seems a paradox, and 
somewhat ridiculous in the bargain: 
the Rangaporn was easily nine feet 
tall, vast and wide as well. It should 
have loomed conspicuously even in a 
pea-soup fog. 

But people see what they expect 
to see, and naturally nobody ever 
expected to see anything remotely 
like the Rangaporn. Yet it did walk 
the roads and was often visible to 
hunters and fishermen in the area of 
the Weltang Woods. The point was, it 
always happened to be far enough 
away for its size not to seem excep- 
tional. And it always appeared to be 
just turning away or walking in the 
opposite direction, so that its face 
could not actually be seen even when 
its body was glimpsed. 

Just a big, roughly dressed fellow, 
probably old, shuffling along with his 
head down. Oh, the Rangaporn was 
good at creating illusions like these. 
They furnished amusement and 
helped a small bit to keep back the 
loneliness. For the Rangaporn was 
lonely. It was tempted, often, to 
show itself to an intelligent-appearing 
woods prowler and try to establish 
communication. But it knew that it 
had never had a poorer idea. The 
Rangaporn could peek into minds 
and saw how irrational, how violent- 



ly reactive this species that called 
itself man could be. 

Forty times this planet had made 
the trip around its primary since the 
Rangaporn had sought haven on it. 
Not exactly by choice. The Ranga- 
porn had been a victim of one of the 
rarest phenomena in galactic travel— a 
space bounce. To be sure, it knew 
what had happened. It suspected that 
somewhere— and with certain data it 
would not be too difficult to calcu- 
late where- another citizen of Czam- 
bozat was sitting on an alien world, 
bounced out of its travel channel by 
its brush with the Rangaporn’s sub- 
space vehicle. And, like th^e Ranga- 
porn, there it would sit until some 
solution occurred to it— or to the 
Rangaporn. If one of them could get 
back into the travel channel the 
bounce could be calculated, and the 
other readily discovered. The Ranga- 
porn hoped that the other castaway 
was busy. At least as busy as the 
Rangaporn itself. 

The plant was compatible. The 
oxygen atmosphere was pleasant. 
The Rangaporn could, in an emer- 
gency, live without it, but this place 
was homelike. The Rangaporn’s own 
planet had an oxygen atmosphere. 

Over the years the Rangaporn had 
made itself comfortable. To have 
built an extensive shelter would have 
been no great task but it would have 
been con^icuous, and sooner or 
later men would have discovered it. 



162 



IF 




However, in the depths of the Wel- 
tang Woods the Rangaporn had 
found what it wanted. There were 
caverns under the highest wooded 
hill. These the Rangaporn had detect- 
ed by resonator. Then with its energy 
bar it had carefully cut entrances 
into either side of the hill. A great 
boulder blocked the living cavern 
that even if the outer entrances were 
found the cave would seem to end at 
the boulder. 

In this cavern the Rangaporn had 
set up and reconditioned the sub- 
space vehicle. It had reorganized 
everything that the space bounce had 
disturbed. It did itself well in the 
matter of food, utilizing the local 
biomass and acquiring its own special 
stores for the time when it would 
leave this planet and re^me its jour- 
ney homeward. 

The Rangaporn left no evidence of 
its feeding. Its matter converter made 
good use of fallen tree branches and 
leaf piles and the myriad small ani- 
mals that lived ih and on them. These 
the converter resolved into basic car- 
bohydrates, lipids and proteins, then 
reassembled into tasty complexes 
that the Rangaporn particularly en- 
joyed. Indeed, the Rangaporn spent 
much time devising and compound- 
ing new ways to prepare foods, sub- 
jecting them to low heat after the 
manner of the local inhabitants. In 
effect, with time on its great gnarled 
hands, it became a gourmet cook. 



It often wondered how its efforts 
compared with the concoctions that 
the natives made and seemed to prize 
and thrive on. It had sampled some 
of these when they had come to 
hand. During the warmer times of 
the year, during the plant growth 
seasons, people often picnicked in 
the Weltang Woods. Food was one of 
the great concerns on these occa- 
sions. The Rangaporn, watching from 
concealment, had no great difficulty 
in collecting samples of various co- 
mestibles, which it tried later in the 
privacy of the home cavern. 

S O it was familiar with pumpkin 
pie (it approved), roasts of beef 
(excellent!), chocolate cake (some- 
what cloying), and baked ham (per- 
haps its choice of anything it had 
tasted). Still, it felt that its own 
creations were probably superior and 
rather chafed at the fact that there 
was no opportunity to have people 
test them. 

Concealment continued to be a 
necessity, if its life were to remain 
peaceful. And the best way to remain 
concealed was to give no evidence 
that anything alien existed in the 
depths of the Weltang Woods. But as 
it improvised one tasty dish after_ 
another, the need for appreciation of 
its growing skill became almost 
greater than the need for conceal- 
ment. Almost, but not quite. 

Finally it devised a small strata- 



SPACE BOUNCE 



163 




gem. Onto a platter that it had 
borrowed from a family outing some 
years before— long enough before, it 
presumed, that the platter would not 
be recognized— the Rangaporn placed 
a generous portion of one of its 
favorite concoctions, delicately 
scented, an appetizing green in color. 
The Rangaporn was partial to green. 

It waited in the vicinity of a 
favored picnicking spot on a day 
particularly conducive to these out- 
door eating parties. Hypersensitive 
ears, reinforced with a special ampli- 
fier of the Rangaporn’s own design, 
could readily keep track of every 
party in the Weltang Woods. And 
when a family— father, mother, and 
three noisy children— could be heard 
approaching its location, the Ranga- 
porn left the platter on a large flat 
rock and retired to observe their 
reactions. Its great broad nose 
twitched in anticipation. It had no 
doubt that its contribution to the 
feast would be received with delight 
and appreciation. 

The screaming children, racing on 
ahead of their parents’ more sedate 
pace, saw the platter first. 

“Shucks,” the older boy said. 
“Somebody’s already here! This is 
my extra special favorite place, too. 
Shucks!” 

“I don’t see nobody,” said his 
smaller brother. “Somebody just left 
a plate. See, the stuff looks all 
moldy.” 



“Yeah,” his brother agreed. “I bet 
it’s been there , a couple of weeks— 
maybe a month, even.” 

“It’s still warm.” Their sister felt 
the platter with a pudgy, practical 
hand. She wrinkled her nose. “It’s 
got a funny smell.” 

The Rangaporn, watching from 
cover, was disappointed. Still, in all 
honesty, it knew what the problem 
was. These beings, even the small 
ones, responded favorably only to 
what they knew. Give them some- 
thing different and they would reject 
it. Of course the Rangaporn was 
aware that human food did not 
resemble the mass on the platter. Yet 
the odor had received special care 
and the creation was even better than 
baked ham. But this, the Rangaporn 
realized, was its own point of view 
which the family evidently didn’t 
share. 

So the Rangaporn watched with- 
out dismay when the mother scraped 
its offering from the platter, the 
better to examine the dish itself. 

“This looks like Molly Pickens’ old 
china pattern,” the woman said with 
interest. “She must have gone off 
and left it. Don’t know how she 
could have, though. Since her kids 
are growh up she and Ed don’t go 
picnicking no more.” 

‘Take it by their house,” the man 
suggested. “Likely somebody found 
it and has been using it.” 

“I will.” The woman scrubbed the 



164 



IF 




dish with a paper towel and set it 
aside. “Wish I had dumped that stuff 
farther away. It smells terrible.”. 

The Rangaporn looked on while 
they ate, memorizing the appearance 
and especially the odors of the food. 
Apparently this species associated 
the color green in protein masses 
with decay. Still, it noted, they ate 
green leaves with avidity. They called 
these a salad. The ham, of course, 
was the flesh of a native creature, 
treated with various seasonings and 
subjected to heat. 

The Rangaporn was undiscour- 
aged, but its mettle was up. It was 
challenged. It knew that in nutritive 
value the foods it prepared were far 
superior to anything these beings ate. 
So it threw precaution to the winds. 
It would introduce members of the 
human race to some genuinely fine 
eating, no matter what would be 
required to persuade them to sample. 
Which showed that the Rangaporn 
had some traits that were closer to 
human than it would have cared to 
admit. No one particularly wishes to 
be equated with primitives. 

It put new biomass through the 
matter converter, sorted the nutritive 
elements into categories, isolated and 
balanced the thirty-two vitamin com- 
plexes it had determined to be vital 
to human well-being. These included 
seven that men apparently had never 
discovered. Then the difficult part 
began. The stuff had to be attractive 



to human eyes and titillating to 
human palates. 

S O, IN addition to cook and nutri- 
tionist the Rangaporn became an 
artist. With a pilfered baked ham 
before it, it built a duplicate from 
carefully compounded ingredients. It 
imitated the very grain of the meat. 
The properly placed bone was a 
masterpiece. And when the ham was 
baked and glazed with a carbohy- 
drate far tastier than sugar, stippled 
with cloves that smelled like cloves 
but were subtly different, the Ranga- 
porn knew that it had produced a 
creation that no human could turn 
from. It would be irresistible. It was 
familiar, and yet blended into it were 
delicate flavors no ham had ever had 
before. 

Rather than be obvious the Ranga- 
porn chose another picnic spot on 
another day of the week. When a 
family finally approached, the Ran- 
gaporn remained until the last mo- 
ment and with a tiny energy unit 
made sure that the offering was 
fragrant and piping hot. 

As usual the children came first. 
There were only two boys this time, 
somewhat older than the last had 
been. Indeed, the voice of the larger 
boy frequently broke from treble to 
bass as was apparently customary 
with the male of the species as it 
approached maturity.

“Hey, look at this!” the big child 
rumbled, though the last word rose 
to a squeak. 

The ham sat on a great blue 
platter, surrounded by a delicate 
green garnish and giving off waves of 
delicious odor. The Rangaporn had 
taken no chances that the platter 
would be recognized. It had con- 
structed the platter itself. It had even 
made the garnish. 

“Smells^ good.” The smaller boy 
sniffed hungrily. “Hey Ma, look what 
somebody done left out here in the 
woods!” 

“Don’t touch it!” The woman and 
the man came bustling up. The man 
carried a big picnic basket. The wo- 
man had wildflowers she had picked 
along the way. She always liked to 
have flowers on the picnic table. 

“What do you think, Henry?” 
They all stood around the flat rock, 
looking at that beautiful, delicious- 
smelling ham. 

“Meant for us all right,” the man 
said. “Only thing is, do they mean us 
good or bad? Lot of people we know 
always use this old flat rock for a 
table.” 

“Somebody’s telling us some- 
thing,” the woman said. 

The man sniffed. 

“Sure smells wonderful,” he said. 
“Never figured any ham could smell 
better’n yours, Bessie, but this’n 
comes close.” 

They stood for another minute. 



then a grin creased the man’s weath- 
er-beaten face. 

“Reckon that’s it,” he said. “Who 
bakes the best ham in this end of the 
county? Whose ham takes the blue 
ribbon at the fair every year?’ 

“Ma’s!” the boys said in unison. 

The man heaved the picnic basket 
up beside the ham. 

“That’s what somebody’s tellin’ 
you, Bessie. She’s givin’ you fair 
warning that you ain’t champion no 
more.” 

He waved an arm. 

“Spread out, boys, and beat the 
bushes. This ham’s still nice and hot. 
Whoever left it ain’t far away.” 

The boys obeyed with enthusiasm, 
but they had been assigned an im- 
possible task. Huge and gnarled and 
broad though it was, the Rangaporn 
simply turned itself sideways, deli- 
cately adjusted the attention of the 
busy searchers, and somehow they 
overlooked it. In a few minutes they 
returned, panting and hungry, to the 
picnic spread out on the flat rock. 
The ham sat in the center. 

“They got away. Pa. Ain’t nobody 
out there now. Are we going to «at 
the ham?” 

“Might as weU,”^ their father decid- 
ed. “They left it for us. And Ma 
better know what she’s up against at 
^e fair, come fall.” 

The Rangaporn had no fault to 
find with the reception its creation 
got this time. Everyone had sec- 



166 



IF 




onds— and thirds. The mound of crisp 
fried chicken that was to have been 
the feature of the feast went almost 
untouched. And the spoken compli- 
ments were as gratifying as the 
hearty eating. 

“I can’t study out,” the woman 
said, “just what makes it different. 
Some new herbs, most likely. The 
flavor isn’t just from the way the 
meat’s prepared. Never tasted any- 
thing exactly like it.” 

“Tastes like I want more,” the 
older boy said. He held out his paper 
plate. 

“Just one slice, Hank.” He was 
Henry Junior, of course. “No sense 
making yourself sick. There’ll be 
some with your eggs in the morn- 
mg. 

Hank filled his mouth. “If I could 
find out who fixed this it’d help you 
out, wouldn’t it, Ma?” 

“Don’t talk with your mouth full, 
son. ’Course I’d like to know who 
baked the ham.” 

“I’m a pretty good tracker,” the 
boy boasted. “I can run’em down if 
anybody can.” 

“Glad you think so well of your- 
self,” his father said dryly. “Just let 
us know. Any time’ll do.” 

THHE Rangaporn looked on with 
tolerant interest as the two boys 
ranged the woods after the boun- 
teous meal. The younger one soon 
tired. He returned to the picnic site, 



where his mother sat nodding in her 
canvas chair and his father snored in 
the string hammock he had slung 
between two trees. 

“Hank thinks he’s a Injun,” the 
little boy said. “He ain’t going to 
find nobody to track.” 

He seated himself at the foot of a 
tree and began to practice mumbly- 
peg*with his new pocketknife. Pres- 
ently he too slept, as people do on 
fine summer afternoons. 

The Rangaporn’s hypersensitive 
hearing recorded the little boy’s re- 
mark, though it was watching Hank’s 
dogged search. It admired the persis- 
tence of the gangling, stringy redhead 
who probably should have been tak- 
ing an afternoon nap himself. It 
seemed a shame that he shouldn’t 
find anything at all. 

The Rangaporn acted on whim. It 
drifted like a shadow to a little glade 
in the path of the searching boy. In a 
bare spot it spread some dust 
smoothly, and then carefully planted 
one foot in the middle of it. As he 
crossed the glade Hank somehow did 
not notice the Rangaporn standing 
behind a tree. But the dust patch 
caught the boy’s eye. In a moment 
he was looking down at the fresh 
track, vast and broad, each of the 
seven toes perfectly outlined. 

It pleased the Rangaporn that 
there was no panic in Hank’s active 
mind. Instead, there was a steady, 
shrewd fitting together of facts. And

receptiveness that the Rangaporn had 
not encountered before in all the 
human minds it had peeked into. 
This boy was different. He was curi- 
ous. He would believe the truth. And 
he would understand why other 
people would not believe. 

The boy searched carefully around 
the big track, but the Rangaporn 
could sense that he expected to find 
nothing more. He stared intently into 
the woods in all directions. He 
looked almost directly at the Ranga- 
pom but saw nothing, for his vision 
was clouded by a shield that the 
human race would not be able to 
understand for millenia. If ever. 

“Pa wouldn’t believe this,” the 
redhead muttered aloud. And deep- 
ly— for once his voice did not break. 
“Like as not, if I brought him to 
see, wouldn’t be nothin’ here any- 
how. Don’t nothin’ leave just one 
track.” 

He walked slowly back to the 
picnic spot, lost in thought, and the 
Rangaporn’s mind followed him ap- 
provingly. The Rangaporn had de- 
cided. Its loneliness and its need to 
share thoughts with another intelli- 
gent being finally justified the risk. 
The boy had connected the ham and 
the track. And he had known that to 
his father this would all be nonsense. 

“If he returns,” mused the Ranga- 
porn, “we’ll talk. He will learn, and I 
will be less lonely. I’ll give some 
thought to the food he’d like.” 



It had never heard the human 
adage that the way to a man’s heart 
was through his stomach, but the 
Rangaporn knew the place of food in 
the concerns of a growing boy. The 
matter converter, processed more bio- 
mass, the Rangaporn improvised bus- 
ily and happily, and the air in the 
cavern under the highest Weltang hill 
was laden with strange and delicious 
aromas. 

The boy did return. He came 
alone, and he headed straight for the 
picnic spot. It was vacation time 
from school. He often wandered far 
and wide. His parents thought noth- 
ing of it. Besides, more and more'he 
was being allowed to be responsible 
for himself. He was fourteen, and 
daily his voice broke less often. 

rrHE Rangaporn was prepared for 
* him. As a final test it left several 
of its broad footprints in dusty 
patches in the picnic glade. Hank 
found them and studied them care- 
fully. The Rangaporn could detect 
neither fear nor apprehension in the 
boy’s mind. Just interest and 
curiosity. 

“Whatever it is, it’s big.” He look- 
ed from the tracks to the surround- 
ing woods but there was nothing to 
see. “It’s got sense. That was the best 
ham we ever had.” He sat on the 
large flat rock. “It don’t mean me no 
harm.” Then he raised his head and 
sniffed; another mouth-watering 



168 



IF 




odor came drifting oii the breeze. 

The Rangaporn was convinced, 
now, that it was making no mistake. 
It emerged from the trees across the 
glade from the boy, striding forward 
slowly, a steaming dish in one tre- 
mendous hand, a cool and fresh- 
smelling salad in the other. Anxious- 
ly its mind scanned that of the boy 
for panic reactions, for signs of revul- 
sion. It had shown itself at a distance 
to allow Hank time to adjust. 

It needn’t have worried. The hoy 
watched it approach, his curiosity 
burning steadily, his nose apprecia- 
ting the fragrances that wafted to 
him from the food. The Rangaporn 
halted several yards away so that 
Hank might study the towering nine 
feet of burly gnarled body, the great 
flat feet, the broad-nosed, wide- 
mouthed face, the three strange oval 
eyes strung across the lowering fore- 
head. 

‘*Since you were interested enough 
to return I felt that I should provide 
the refreshment.” The Rangaporn’s 
soft, singing voice was in complete 
contrast to its terrifying appearance. 

The boy stared at it in silence for a 
moment. Then: “That was a plumb 
good ham,” he said. 

“I am pleased that you enjoyed 
it.” The beautiful sounds rolled from 
the wide, thin-lipped mouth. “It was 
a challenge to prepare.” 

The boy grinned. 

“Ma’d like to know how you fixed 



it, I bet. She figgers one of the 
neighbors has got a better recipe than 
hers.” 

“That might be arranged.” The 
Rangaporn walked gingerly over to 
the rock and set down the dishes. 
But the boy showed no fear. He 
didn’t shrink away from the bulk of 
this alien creature, now almost beside 
him. The Rangaporn was gratified. 

“You will have to take the infor- 
mation to your mother,” it said. 
“I’m sure she wouldn’t care to inter- 
view me.” 

“Where would I tell her I got it?” 

“A point,” the Rangaporn admit- 
ted. “A very good point. We’ll give 
the matter some thought.” 

From the baggy, voluminous trav- 
esty of human garments it wore the 
Rangaporn produced two plates and 
two sets of silverware, each rolled in 
a snowy napkin, followed by two 
goblets and a carafe of clear, spark- 
ling liquid. 

“Spring water,” it explained. “For 
the growing young, there is nothing 
better with food.” 

Somehow the Rangaporn made 
itself comfortable on the ground 
beside the flat rock. Deftly it heaped 
the two plates with what appeared to 
be meat from the steaming dish- 
meat covered with a pungent green 
sauce and accompanied by plenty of 
salad. It passed a plate to the boy. 

“See if this is palatable. The flavor 
is a conceit of mine.”

Hank sniffed. “Smefls good. I 
could smell it all the way across the 
clearin’.” He took a bite and chewed. 
A beatific expression grew on his 
freckled face. 

“Man, this is eatin’!” 

“I am pleased that you like it,” 
the Rangaporn said. “I had hoped 
that you would.” It tucked a portion 
into its own wide mouth, revolved its 
dentures briefly in the fashion of its 
kind, and swallowed. The boy 
watched with fascination. 

“You don’t belong here,” he said 
bluntly. “I never seen any-” he 
hesitated, “—body that looked like 
you. Not anywhere. But,” he added, 
“you sure can cook!” 

The Rangaporn’s wide mouth grew 
wider and the three strange eyes 
gleamed. 

“It is good to be appreciated,” it 
sighed. “It has been so long.” 

H ank ate hungrily. The Ranga- 
porn marveled at the peace in 
the boy’s mind, at the faith that, in 
spite of its size and appearance, the 
Rangaporn meant no harm. Hank 
seemed completely at ease. 

“You ain’t been around here 
long,” he said when his plate was 
empty. “Big as you are, somebody 
would have seen you sure.” 

“Unfortunately, neither statement 
is conect,” said the Rangaporn. “I 
have been here many years. It has 



not been too difficult to remain 
unseen. But it has been lonely.” 
“How come you’re hidin’ out? But 
I guess that’s a silly question, ain’t it? 
You don’t look much like folks.” 

The Rangaporn nodded. 

“Correct. Suppose anyone you 
know, your father or his friends or 
neighbors, were suddenly to meet me 
in these woods. What would they 
do?” 

“Run like anything, I reckon,” 
Hank admitted. “Or else take a shot 
at you if they had a gun along.” 

“And then come later in force to 
search for me. It has seemed wiser to 
make no contacts. More peaceful, 
anyway. And I have no love of 
turmoil or excitement. My life has 
always been gracious and tranquil, as 
befits a Rangaporn.” 

“A what?” 

“I am the Rangaporn of Czambo- 
zat.” There was an almost regal pride 
in the dulcet, musical tones. “Some- 
where, at a distance into the galaxy 
that you would find hard to compre- 
hend, it is a name with meaning. 
Somewhere, many beings are con- 
cerned about the fortunes— or the 
fate— of the Rangaporn, of me.” 

The boy studied the huge form 
reflectively. 

“If you was able to get here, they 
oughta be able to find you.” 

“A good point,” said the Ranga- 
porn approvingly. “Without doubt 
they are trying. My subspace traverse 



170 



IF 




was a standard one, but there is no 
way to determine at what point I 
deviated from it. Iherefore search is 
futile.” 

“Are you tryin’ to tell me you 
come here from somewhere else than 
this earth? From out in space, farther 
than Mars? Farther than the astro- 
nauts have been? Don’t nobody be- 
lieve stuff like that.” 

“You can believe it,” the Ranga- 
porn said. “That is why I have shown 
myself to you and to no other. Your 
mind is freer, a bit more open, even 
though you are only a boy. You have 
said that I do not appear human, and 
of course I am not. You will believe 
that. You may not understand, but 
you will believe.” 

“You ain’t from around here, 
that’s sure,” Hank said. “But if 
you’re stuck here you might as well 
get to know people. I could help you 
with that.” 

“You are idealistic.” The Ranga- 
porn’s broad face projected a sort of 
weary sadness. “Unfortunately I 
know your species. I would be re- 
garded as strange— a freak. Many 
kinds of evil would be attributed to 
me by the less intelligent. I prefer to 
wait. There is still one chance that I 
may, eventually, leave for home.” 

The Rangaporn had speculated 
much on that one chance. A remote 
possibility, but valid. The subspace 
vehicle whose collision course with 
the Rangaporn’s had caused the 



space bounce had also been deflect- 
ed. It would have sought the nearest 
compatible solid mass, the nearest 
planet. Such safety features were 
built into every vehicle. Perhaps the 
other victim of the space bounce had 
found haven in this same system. The 
Rangaporn had noted that there were 
nine planets here. Few systems had 
so many. 

It tried to convey these things to 
the boy and could feel Hank’s belief 
grow, though the details themselves 
meant little to him. 

“My angle of bounce from the 
subspace channel was recorded by 
my computer,” the Rangaporn ex- 
plained. “However, my distance and 
direction are unknown. Were it pos- 
sible to contact the other member of 
my species, whose vehicle collided 
with mine and whose angle of 
bounce would also be known, we 
could then relocate the subspace 
channel. Only in the channel can our 
vehicles take us home.” 

H ank eyed the big form thought- 
fully, while his mind 
chewed on the problem. 

“What are you doin’ about it?” he 
inquired. 

‘The direct approach,” the Ranga- 
pom said wryly. “Regretfully, very 
httle. I project distress signals at a 
given time each day, but these do not 
have subspace potential. The only 
possible listener would be my fellow

171 




in distress, from the other vehicle. If 
his capacity to communicate were 
damaged by the bounce he may not 
hear or, hearing, may not be able to 
reply.” 

“What could he do, if he could 
hear you but couldn’t answer?” 
“Within this system, he might 
come to me. But from even the 
nearest star system the distance is 
great.” 

“If you got a spaceship, like you 
say,” Hank’s doubt was obvious, 
“couldn’t you look for him?” 

“I could, within the system,” the 
Rangaporn admitted, “but it would 
entail physical search of eight un- 
comfortable planets despite the 
short-range detection devices I have. 
And the probability of his being on 
any of them at aU is relatively low.” 
“So you figger your best bet is just 
to wait. S’pose nobody never 
comes?” 

“Eventually I would certainly look 
for him,” said the Rangaporn. “But I 
am young yet. I have been here only 
forty of your years. And I know that 
the concern for me is great.” 

Still, the Rangaporn was thinking 
with regret of those forty years. Its 
life span would be in the thousands 
of such units, but this time of life 
was special. And for a reason that 
Hank would have found hard to 
believe. 

The boy came often that summer. 
Always the Rangaporn had food. 



strange, savory and different, and 
Hank thrived on it as no human 
young had thrived since the begin- 
ning of his race— never before had 
nutrition been so perfect. The Ranga- 
porn reveled in his company after 
those years of solitude and became 
almost content. 

One day Hank took home a page 
of white paper covered with beauti- 
ful flowing green script, a careful 
detailing of the preparation of the 
ham. The only difference between 
this recipe and the Rangaporn’s was 
that this recipe started with a real 
ham. 

“Found it stuck on a tree,” he 
told his mother. “Meant for you. 
Ain’t no doubt about that. They left 
it for me to find.” 

“Hank,” the woman said seriously, 
“do you know who fixed that ham?” 

“Maybe,” the boy evaded. “Any- 
how, I got my s’picions.” He grinned 
mysteriously and his mother relaxed. 
Hank was a good boy. She trusted 
him. He was enjoying himself, and 
sooner or later she’d find out who 
her competitor was. 

When the Rangaporn was convinc- 
ed that Hank was dependable, that 
the security of its home under the 
Weltang hill would not be in jeopar- 
dy, it took the boy to see the cavern. 
The Rangaporn enjoyed his awe and 
wonder. But there was something 
solid and sturdy about this boy that 
allowed him to adjust and accept. 



172 



IF 




“Nobody’d believe this,” Hank 
said, “but it makes sense that such 
things could be.” 

H e examined the deceptively 
small metallic capsule that was 
the subspace vehicle. His eyes wid- 
ened at the operation of the matter 
converter. He admired the multi- 
colored draperies, rich and strangly 
soothing, with which the Rangaporn 
had hung the cavern walls. Soft lights 
flooded the cavern from hidden 
sources. On a small pedestal, a com- 
pact unit of metal plates and glowing 
strips and rows of glistening buttons 
hummed softly. 

“My communicator,” the Ranga- 
porn explained. 

“What’s this little thing that just 
started wiggling?” 

The boy was amazed and startled 
as the great form of the Rangaporn 
suddenly loomed over him. 

“It is contact!” 

Gently the Rangaporn touched 
buttons and passed spatulate fingers 
delicately along the glowing strips. 
The little metronome-like pendulum 
ticked and paused and ticked again. 
The big fingers made other patterns. 
The pendulum ticked in response. 
And finally the Rangaporn straight- 
ened slowly. The three strange eyes 
were luminous. 

“I have been located!” The musi- 
cal voice had never been more beauti- 
ful. “In only a few of your minutes a 



subspace vehicle will appear at the 
cavern entrance. It is the one with 
which my vehicle bounced. It con- 
tains another of my species, one 
whose communicator has not until 
this time been functional. He was not 
skilled in repair and found it neces- 
sary to duplicate the entire device, 
beginning with the philosophy of 
communication. It has been time- 
consuming.” 

Hank brushed details aside. Boy- 
like, he was concerned with the 
immediate, the now. 

“Oh, boy— another one like you! 
m get to see another Rangaporn, 
huh?” 

The three glowing eyes of the 
Rangaporn exuded a strange excite- 
ment, and the beautiful voice seemed 
to ring with muted laughter. For a 
moment it almost reminded Hank of 
his mother’s voice— when she was 
happy ; when she sang. 

“No, Hank, not another like me. 
Another of my species, but not a 
Rangaporn.” 

“Different from you? How?” 

Again that impression of lilting 
laughter. 

“You will see. Go to the cavern 
entrance and wait. You will find it 
interesting to see the vehicle appear. 
I will join you in moments.” 

There was a happy urgency to the 
Rangapom’s gentle voice. Hank 
obeyed it without thinking. 

Outside, the woods were quiet

with the sleepy stillness of a late 
summer afternoon. Nothing stined. 
Ihere were no sounds. And the 
spaceship, shimmering mistily, ma- 
terialized, a small metallic capsule 
resting full length on the forest floor. 
A hatch opened. A creature emerged. 
It was not a Rangaporn. ^ 

It strode toward the boy on short 
crooked legs, but its feet were large 
and flat and seven-toed. Its blocky 
body was gnarled and misshapen. 
Still, the wide mouth and three 
strange oval eyes looked familiar. It 
was no more than four feet tall. 

HE Rangaporn watched quietly 

from behind the boy, monitor- 
ing his thoughts, feeling his reaction 
to what was to him a grotesque and 
ridiculous little figure strutting to- 
ward him. The Rangaporn’s re- 
sponses were far different. The im- 
pression of masculinity which Hank 
had picked up from the Rangaporn— 
and which no human being would 
have doubted for a moment— was not 
confirmed by the reaction of the 
Rangaporn. Warm and feminine and 
all-enveloping, her admiration flood- 
ed out toward the handsomest little 
male she had ever seen. 

She moved from the cavern en- 
trance, slowly and with an alien 
grace, and stood with Hank. Her 
fellow citizen stopped and stared, his 
three eyes gleaming. He extended his 
oversized, big-knuckled hands palms 



up, and bowed his bullet head. 

“I am Gzal of Czambozat.” It was 
a harsh, rasping, uncouth voice, but 
it had vigor and more than a touch of 
arrogance. And there was awe in it, 
too, and astonishment, as he added: 
“And you— you are the Rangaporn!” 
The Rangaporn’s soft voice had 
never been more musical. 

“Czal. Our meeting is fortune-de- 
termined. Predestined. Do you be- 
lieve such thoughts?” 

“I believe anything you believe,” 
the little male said gallantly. 

She laid her huge splayed hand 
lightly on Hank’s shoulder. The boy’s 
eyes widened at the shimmering robe 
that had replaced her humanlike, 
nondescript clothing. 

“This is Hank,” said the Ranga- 
porn. “His species rules this planet.” 
She sensed the immediate surge of 
jealousy from the intense little Czal 
and her voice laughed as she added, 
“He is only a juvenile— and my 
friend. Be gracious!” 

“You are fortunate. Hank,” said 
the little male of Czambozat. “On all 
our home planet there is no more 
beautiful, no more kindly, no more 
wonderful being than the Rangaporn. 
She has no peer, and she calls you 
her friend. Be grateful!” 

“Golly.” Hank found his voice, 
but it broke and peaked into a treble, 
“I thought she was a he!” 

“We respond to what we know,” 
the Rangaporn said soothingly, be- 



174 



IF 




fore Czal’s indignation could flare. 
“Even the smells of the food I 
prepared to my own taste were not 
pleasing to human nostrils. Only 
after I conformed to familiar appear- 
ance and odor patterns were my 
offerings enjoyed.” 

“Yeah.” The boy looked from one 
to the other, then nodded his head. 
“You don’t look like us, and I don’t 
know what you think is pretty.” 
Then he grinned at Czal, with a look 
older than his years. “I can tell you 
this, though. She’s sure some won- 
derful cook!” 

The little male’s wide mouth grew 
wider; his rolling dentures showed. 

“Important information,” Czal 
said. “I am most grateful to you!” 
Hank hesitated. His grin faded. 



“Gee,” he said, “you’ll be leaving, 
won’t you? Putting together what 
you both know, you can get back on 
the track, can’t you?” 

“Yes, Hank,” the Rangaporn said 
gently. “We have the coordinates we 
need. We can go home.” Her voice 
softened. “I’ll miss you.” 

The boy looked up at the vast 
kindly form in the shimmering robe. 
He knew now why he had been 
reminded of his mother. 

“I don’t know,” Hank said, “why 
I ever thought you was a he.” 

“If you had known our tongue, 
there would have been no doubt.” 
She was right, of course. 

For in the graceful language of 
Czambozat, Rangaporn means Lady.
